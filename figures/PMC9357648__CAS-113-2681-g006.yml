caption: lncRNA XLOC013218 (XLOC) promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis
  by activating the PIK3R2‐mediated PIK3/AKT signaling pathway. A, KEGG analysis of
  differentially expressed genes. B, Western blot analysis of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway–related
  genes. C, Western blot analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis‐associated related genes.
  D, E, Western blot analysis of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway–related genes in V‐NC
  or V‐XLOC cells after transfection with sh‐PIK3R2 or sh‐NC. F, Expression of p110β
  in U87 and U251 cells cotransfected with V‐XLOC and sh‐PIK3R2 or their control (scale
  bar, 100 μm)
