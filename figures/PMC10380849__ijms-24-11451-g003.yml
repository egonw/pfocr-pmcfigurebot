caption: 'The NLRP3 pathway is involved in E. coli infection: (a,b) representative
  photomicrographs of immunohistochemistry results showing the staining of GSDMD-N
  in different groups (scale bar, 50 μm; typical injuries are depicted by the arrows);
  the intestine’ mean density of GSDMD-N was determined (n = 3); (c,d) Western blotting
  was used to detect the expression levels of GSDMD and GSDMD-N in the intestine of
  mice and compared with β-actin (n = 3); (e) volcano plot: the volcano plot was constructed
  using the fold change values and p-adjusted values. Purple dots represent genes
  with significant fold change value and p value, blue dots represent genes with significant
  p value, gray dots represent genes with insignificant fold change value and p value,
  and green dots represent genes with significant fold change value (The red font
  highlights genes in the NLRP3 pathway); (f) the heatmap of the differential gene
  expression, with different colors representing the trend of gene expression in different
  tissues (The red font highlights genes in the NLRP3 pathway); (g) functional enrichment:
  the enriched KEGG signaling pathways were selected to demonstrate the primary biological
  actions of major potential mRNA (The red font highlights genes in the NOD-like receptor
  pathway); (h) network of interacting proteins predicted via NLRP3. All data are
  shown as the mean ± SD. **** p < 0.0001, and * p < 0.05.'
