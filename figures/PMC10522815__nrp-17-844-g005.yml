figure_title: Effects of fucoidan on the expression of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA signaling
  pathway. A549 cells were incubated with fucoidan (0–100 µg/mL) for 48 h. (A) Protein
  expression was evaluated by western blotting and normalized with β-actin. (B) Relative
  Rac1 protein expression. (C) Relative Cdc42 protein expression. (D) Relative RhoA
  protein expression. All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
  (n = 4)
caption: Rac1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; Cdc42, cell division control
  protein 42; RhoA, Ras homolog gene family member A.*P < 0.05 was considered for
  statistical significance when compared with the untreated control.
article_title: Antimetastatic effect of fucoidan against non-small cell lung cancer
  by suppressing non-receptor tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase
  pathway.
