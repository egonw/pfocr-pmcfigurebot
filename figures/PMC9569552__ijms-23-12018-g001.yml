caption: 'Function, internalization, and endosome-escaping ability of Emi-Fab. (A)
  Effects of Emi-Fab and Emi-IgG4 on c-MET degradation. Results are shown as the mean
  ± SD and are pooled from two independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
  (B) Internalization of Emi-IgG4 and Emi-Fab at equal molar concentrations. Images
  were acquired at 100× magnification. Scale bars: 20 μm. (C) Representative microscopy
  images of cytosolic fluorescence distribution in HCC827-GFP1-10 cells treated with
  Emi-IgG4-GFP11 (250 nM) or Emi-Fab (500 nM) for 6 h and 48 h, respectively, as indicated.
  (D) Histograms of GFPβ1-10 expressing HCC827 cells treated with Emi-Fab-GFPβ11 or
  Emi-IgG4-GFPβ11 as measured by flow cytometry.'
