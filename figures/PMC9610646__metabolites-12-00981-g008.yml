caption: 'Metabolic pathway analysis. (A) Enrichment analysis of normal group and
  model group. (B) Topology analysis of normal group and model group. (C) Enrichment
  analysis of model group and drug administration group. (D) Topological analysis
  of model group and drug administration group. Note: The horizontal coordinates of
  B and D are the ORA analysis p-values, with the blue area being significant (p <
  0.05); the vertical coordinates are the topological analysis effects.'
