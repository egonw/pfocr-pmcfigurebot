caption: Fargesin induced morphological changes by suppression of PI3K/PKB signaling
  pathway. (a) Fargesin induces morphology changes in cells. JB6 Cl41 (5 × 104) and
  HCT8 (5 × 104) cells were seeded into 6-well plates, cultured overnight, and treated
  with indicated doses of fargesin. Representative photographs were obtained by observation
  under a light microscope (×200). (b–e) Effects of fargesin on the phosphorylation
  of ERKs and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Phosphoprotein profiles of MEKs/ERKs/RSKs
  signaling pathway (b,d) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (c,e) in JB6 Cl41 (b,c) and
  WiDr and HCT8 colon cancer cells (d,e). Total proteins (20 µg) extracted from JB6
  Cl41 and colon cancer cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF
  membrane. The indicated proteins were visualized by probing the specific antibodies.
  β-actin was used to verify equal protein loadings.
