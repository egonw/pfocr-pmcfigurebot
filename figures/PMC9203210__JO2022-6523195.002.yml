caption: Autophagy is activated in PCa cells. (a) Western blotting was used to detect
  the reduction of P62 and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I by serum starvation (SS) in PCa
  cells for 24 h with or without E64 and PEPS A. (b-c) Relative quantification of
  the protein expression of P62 and LC3-II/LC3-I in . (d, f) Western blot results
  selected the best time and concentration of autophagy inhibition. (e, g, h, i) Relative
  quantification of the protein expression of LC3-II/LC3-I and P62 in Figures  and
  . (j, m) Cell morphology under a light microscope in FN or SS conditions after 10 mM
  3-MA for 24 h or 100 μM Baf-A1 for 12 h. (k, n) PC-3 cells were transfected with
  pEGFP-C1-LC3 plasmid and cultured in FN or SS conditions and treated with 10 mM
  3-MA for 24 h or 100 μM Baf-A1 for 12 h. A fluorescence microscope was used to film
  cells to determine the expression of LC3-II. Red arrows pointed to green puncta.
  (l, o) Quantification of the numbers of LC3 puncta/cell in Figures  and . ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001; and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
