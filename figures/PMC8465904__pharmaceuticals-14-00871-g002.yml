caption: The crosstalk of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway with the Hippo, TGFβ, EGFR, VEGF,
  c-Met, and Notch signaling pathways modulates cancer progression and apoptosis,
  depending on the cellular context. An activation of the canonical Wnt pathway induces
  the stability of cytoplasmic β-catenin when the Wnt ligand binds FZ/Lrp5/6. This
  leads to a phosphorylation of Dvl, which inactivates the Destruction Complex, allowing
  an increase in the levels of free cytoplasmic β-catenin, which is then translocated
  to the nucleus, bound to TCF/LEF and transcription activators, to induce genic expression.
  On the other hand, the Hippo signaling increases β-catenin cytoplasmic levels by
  inactivating YAP/TAZ via SAV/MST1/2/LATS 1/2. When phosphorylated, YAP/TAZ activates
  the destruction complex via Dvl inhibition and sequestration of β-catenin. However,
  β-catenin also inhibits YAP/TAZ via Dvl and proteasomal activity, blocking the genic
  expression induced by YAP/TAZ. The Hippo signaling is activated via CD44/NF2 and
  p53. The TGFβ signaling pathway can also induce the cytoplasmic stability of β-catenin
  through smad 7. In turn, smad 7 interacts with TAK1 and MKK3, leading to the activation
  of p38 and the subsequent activation of AKT, inactivation of GSK 3β, and stabilization
  of β-catenin. The EGF pathway also can induce an increase in free cytoplasmic β-catenin
  by promoting the phosphorylation (inactivation) of α-catenin bound to E-cadherin
  through ERK activation. The VEGFR pathway also can increase the cytoplasmic levels
  of β-catenin through eNOS activation, which induces the S-nitrosylation of β-catenin,
  promoting its dissociation from α-catenin and its nuclear translocation. In addition,
  after the HGF ligand binds its receptor, c-MET promotes the phosphorylation of c-Met-associated
  β-catenin and a subsequent release of free cytoplasmic β-catenin. However, the activation
  of the Notch pathway by its Jagger ligand can decrease the cytoplasmic levels of
  β-catenin through the induction of DKK and Yap/Taz transcripts, which inhibit the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Conversely, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibits the Notch
  pathway through Dvl and DP1. Additionally, β-catenin induces the activation of the
  pro-apoptotic transcriptional factor FOXO. Depending on the cellular context, this
  could lead either to a carcinogenic process or a cell death process on cancer cells.
