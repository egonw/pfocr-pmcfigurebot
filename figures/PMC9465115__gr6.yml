caption: The dia-PASEF workflow allows the robust detection of characteristic EGF
  signaling events.A, numbers of all identified phosphopeptides and phosphosites before
  and after filtering for localization probability and data completeness. B, phosphoproteome
  Pearson correlation matrix. Scatter plot shows the correlation of replicates within
  a condition. C, volcano plot of phosphosites regulated upon 15 min of EGF treatment
  in HeLa cells versus untreated cells. (Two-sided Student’s t test, FDR <0.01 = gray,
  FDR <0.05 = dark gray). Protein’s part of the GOBP term “EGFR signaling pathway”
  are highlighted in turquoise. D, Fisher’s exact test of proteins with significantly
  increased phosphosites upon EGF treatment (p < 0.002). Enrichment annotations are
  GOBP, GOMF, and KEGG. E, scheme of significantly upregulated phosphosites that were
  detected in this study and are part of the GOBP term “EGFR signaling pathway” and/or
  changed significantly upon EGF stimulation (FDR < 0.05). DIA, data-independent acquisition;
  EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; FDR, false discovery rate; GOBP,
  Gene Ontology Biological Process; GOMF, Gene Ontology Molecular Function; KEGG,
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; PASEF, parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation.
