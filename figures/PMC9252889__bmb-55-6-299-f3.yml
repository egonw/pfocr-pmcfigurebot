caption: ClC-5 knockdown induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway in CCA cells. After shClC-5 transfection, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial
  membrane potential, and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway related-proteins were detected.
  (A, B) Representative flow cytometry scatter plots (A) and statistical results of
  apoptotic cell populations (B) in both QBC939 and SNU-869 cells; (C, D) The protein
  levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in both QBC939 (C) and SNU-869 (D) cells; (E-G) Representative
  JC-1 staining images (E, F) and statistical results of mitochondrial membrane potential
  (MMP) (G) in both QBC939 and SNU-869 cells; (H-K) The protein levels of mitochondrial
  cytochrome c (mito Cyt-c), cytoplasmic cytochrome c (Cyto Cyt-c), and Cleaved caspase-3
  in both QBC939 (H, I) and SNU-869 (J, K) cells. mean ± SD, n = 4; **P < 0.01 vs.
