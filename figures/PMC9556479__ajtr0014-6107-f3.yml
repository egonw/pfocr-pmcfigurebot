caption: 'Association of ATRX mutations with anti-tumor immunity and tumor microenvironment
  (TME). A. Heatmap depicting several anti-tumor immunity indicators including TMB,
  immune checkpoint genes expression, cytolytic activity (CYT), inflammation signature
  score, immunologic constant of rejection (ICR) score, IFN-γ signaling score and
  TGF-β pathway activity. The score of these anti-tumor immunity indicators has been
  log2 transformed. B. Heatmap showing the enrichment score of 29 functional gene
  expression signatures (Fegs). The 29 Fegs were used to classify the TME into four
  subtypes: anti-tumor microenvironment, pro-tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis
  fibrosis and malignant cell properties. The up and down arrows on the left side
  of heatmap represented up-regulation and down-regulation in ATRX-mt patients, respectively.
  The number on the left side of indicated the P value (ATRX-mt vs ATRX-wt). C. Boxplot
  comparing the infiltration of 22 immune cells between ATRX-mt and ATRX-wt patients.
  CIBERSORT was used to assess the abundance of these immune cells. ***P < 0.001,
  **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.'
