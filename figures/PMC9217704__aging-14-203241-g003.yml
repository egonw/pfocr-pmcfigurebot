caption: Examining effects of CXCR4 knockdown on decreasing the cancer (EOC) invasion
  capacity. A transwell tumour cell invasion assay showed that knockdown of CXCR4
  reduced the invasion ability of OVCA420 cell lines (A) and that overexpression of
  CXCR4 enhanced the invasion ability of SKOV3 cells (G). The number of invaded cells
  were quantified by counting the total number of cells from 10 random fields (magnification,
  200X) (C, I). A wound-healing assay showed that knockdown of CXCR4 reduced the migration
  ability of OVCA420 cells (B, D) and that overexpression of CXCRC4 enhanced the migration
  ability of SKOV3 cells (H, J), respectively. The effects of CXCR4 on the expression
  of EMT-related E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin protein levels indicated in both
  CXCR4-knockdown OVCA420 (E) and -overexpressed SKOV3 (K) cell lines were analysed
  by WB with the indicated antibody against each protein examined, respectively. Band
  density ratios of each protein indicated to β-actin were determined by densitometry
  analysis (F, L). Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  Asterisk indicates P<0.05 compared with the controls as determined by t test.
