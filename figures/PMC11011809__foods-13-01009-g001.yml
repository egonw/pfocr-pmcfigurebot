  pathways in engineered C. tyrobutyricum for butyrate and butanol production from
  glucose. (B) The design of gene adhE2 expression. (C) The main fermentation products
  of CtAD in CGM and SSP medium. (D) The optimization of the CGM. (E) The growth performance
  of CtAD in CGM and SSP medium. (Gene name and abbreviation: pykA: pyruvate kinase;
