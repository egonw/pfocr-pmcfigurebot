caption: Signaling pathway of ISL1 in NB mediation. The binding of growth factor to
  the tyrosine kinase receptor leads to the cross-phosphorylation of the receptor.
  The phosphorylation then leads to activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways. These pathways
  further lead to the phosphorylation and activation of ISL1. The activation then
  leads to various cellular processes such as tumorigenesis, cancer cell progression,
  metastasis, and cell proliferation. PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine
  kinase family; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; ISL1, Insulin gene enhancer
  binding protein; MAPK, Mitigen-activated protein kinase; TK, Tyrosine kinase; P,
  Phosphorylation.
