figure_title: Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism by which thiostrepton modulates
  ferroptosis via the STAT3/GPX4 signalling pathway
caption: In general, in pancreatic cancer cells, TST does not regulate the function
  of SLC711A but instead alters the expression of STAT3. Activated STAT3 binds to
  the GPX4 promoter region to promote its transcription. Therefore, GPX4 downregulation
  by TST subsequently promotes the production of lipid ROS, leading to lipid peroxidation
  that ultimately induces ferroptosis.
