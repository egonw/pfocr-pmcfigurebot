caption: Determination of the intracellular redox environment of A172 and U251 cells.
  (A, B, a, b) DHE method for evaluating ROS production in A172 and U251 cells in
  each group. (C, D) Changes in GSH-PX, MDA, and SOD expression of A172 and U251 cells
  in each group (vs. control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). DHE, dihydroethidium; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; GSH-PX, glutathione peroxidase; MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD, superoxide
  dismutase; NC, negative control; O.E, overexpressed; K.D, knockdown. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate
