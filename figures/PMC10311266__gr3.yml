caption: TRAF7 deficiency inhibits RNA virus-mediated signaling. A Knockout efficiencies
  of TRAF7. A strategy for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of TRAF7. The deletions
  were confirmed by immunoblot analysis and DNA sequence analysis of genomic DNA isolated
  from TRAF7 wild-type and deletion cell lines. B TRAF7 deficiency facilitates the
  activation of the IFN-β promoter and ISRE. HEK 293 wild-type and TRAF7-deficient
  cells (1 ​× ​105) were transfected with pRL-TK (0.025 ​μg) and IFN-β promoter (0.025 ​μg)
  or ISRE (0.025 ​μg). After 12 ​h, the cells were treated with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for
  12 ​h or left untreated before luciferase analysis. C TRAF7 deficiency enhances
  the dimerization of IRF3. HEK 293 wild-type and TRAF7-deficient cells (2 ​× ​106)
  were treated with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for 12 ​h or untreated before immunoblotting analysis.
  D Knockout of TRAF7 improves the transcript levels of downstream antiviral genes.
  HEK 293 wild-type and TRAF7-deficient cells (2 ​× ​106) were treated with SeV (MOI ​= ​1)
  for 12 ​h or untreated before qPCR analysis. E Knockout TRAF7 improves the production
  of IFN-β protein. ELISA of IFN-β in HEK 293 wild-type and TRAF7-deficient cells
  were infected with SeV for 12 ​h. F Knockout TRAF7 impairs the ability of viral
  replication. HEK 293 wild-type and TRAF7-deficient cells were infected or uninfected
  with VSV (MOI ​= ​0.2) for 16 ​h before collecting the supernatants to infect Vero
  cells. (∗∗P ​< ​0.01; ns, no signiﬁcant difference).
