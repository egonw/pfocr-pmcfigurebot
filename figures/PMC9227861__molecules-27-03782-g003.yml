caption: 'Effect of SCU on LPS-induced protein expression of p-p65 and p-IкBα. RAW264.7
  cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/mL) and treated with SCU (0, 25, 50, and 75 μM)
  for at 37 °C 48 h. (A) Relative density of p-p65 (B) Relative density of p-IkBα.
  Comparison with only LPS treated group # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001. Comparison with SCU and LPS treated group (C) Molecular docking with
  NF-κB and SCU.'
