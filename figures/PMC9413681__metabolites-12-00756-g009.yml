caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment in cotyledons (a) and embryonic axes (b) performed
  with the MetaboAnalyst platform and a p < 0.05 threshold. Metabolic pathways are
  indicated with circles according to their scores from enrichment (vertical axis;
  (−log(p)) and topology analyses. Darker colors indicate more significant changes
  in metabolites in the corresponding pathway. The size of a circle corresponds to
  the pathway impact score and is correlated with the centrality of the involved metabolites.
  Because of the highest pathway impact, the ‘phenylalanine metabolism’ pathway is
  exceptionally visualized (p = 0.07). The shaded part of chart b corresponds to the
  whole of chart a.
