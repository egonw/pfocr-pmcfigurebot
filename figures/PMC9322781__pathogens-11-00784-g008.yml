caption: (A) Venn analysis of the indicated microbial KO numbers among the four different
  groups (E2, n = 5; OTC, n = 6; GXN, n = 6; IUA-Con, n = 6). (B,C) Venn analysis
  for the numbers of significantly up-regulated (B) and down-regulated KOs (C) in
  E2, OTC and GXN groups, compared to the IUA control group (E2, n = 5; OTC, n = 6;
  GXN, n = 6; IUA control, n = 6). (D) The top 10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated
  KOs (red) in E2 compared to those in IUA controls (blue) (E2, n = 5; control n =
  6, <0.05 and fold change > 2). (E) The top 10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated
  KOs (red) in OTC compared to those in IUA controls (blue) (OTC, n = 6; control n
  = 6, p < 0.05 and fold change > 2). (F) The top 10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated
  KOs (red) in GXN compared to those in controls (blue) (GXN, n = 6; control n = 6,
  p < 0.05). (G) KEGG analysis of categorizing all the significantly up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes in the E2 group compared to IUA control (relative abundance,
  log2 scale, p < 0.05). Only the top 20 changed pathways are shown. (H) KEGG analysis
  of categorizing all the significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the
  OTC group compared to control (relative abundance, log2 scale, p < 0.05). Only the
  top changed 20 annotations are shown. The most up-regulated pathways in OTC compared
  to IUA control were glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins, amino
  acid metabolism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ubiquinone and other terpenoid
  quinone biosynthesis, cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance, renal cell
  carcinoma, arginine and proline metabolism, Tropane/piperidine and pyridine alkaloid
  biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism. The most down-regulated pathways in OTC
  were base excision repair, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway,
  TNF signaling pathway, leishmaniasis, tetracycline biosynthesis, retrograde endocannabinoid
  signaling, regulation of lipolysis in adipocyte, Type I polyketide structures, biosynthesis
  of 12-, 14-, and 16-membered macrolides, Biosynthesis of type II polyketide backbone.
  (I) KEGG analysis of categorizing all the significantly up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes in GXN compared to IUA control. The most up-regulated pathways in the GXN
  group compared to the IUA control were other glycan degradation, carbohydrate digestion
  and absorption, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, thyroid hormone synthesis, while the
  most down-regulated pathways were nitrogen metabolism, butanoate metabolism, arginine
  biosynthesis, oxytocin signaling pathway, atrazine degradation, and mRNA surveillance
  pathway.
