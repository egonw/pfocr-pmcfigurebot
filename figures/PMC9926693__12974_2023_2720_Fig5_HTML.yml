caption: Deposition of p-α-synuclein in SCs induces inflammatory responses via activating
  TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. A, B Representative confocal images and quantitative
  analysis of TLR2 in the rat left vagus nerve at 3 months post-injection. Scale bar = 10 μm.
  n = 6. C, D Representative confocal images and quantitative analysis of IL-1β in
  the rat left vagus nerve at 3 months post-injection. Scale bar = 10 μm. n = 6. Representative
  western blot bands (E) and the statistical graph (F–J) of total α-synuclein, p-α-synuclein,
  MyD88, p-NF-κB p65, and IL-1β in the rat left vagus nerve at 3 months post-injection.
  The protein levels were normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold over AAV-EV. n = 4.
  K–M Representative immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis of TLR2
  in sural nerves of controls and PD patients. Scale bar = 10 μm. n = 6. Data were
  presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA
  followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test in B, D, and F–J, and Student’s
  t test in M. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant
