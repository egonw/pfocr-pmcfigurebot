caption: 'Masson staining and WB assay were applied to assess the extent of fibrosis
  in the heart tissue sections. Masson staining of cardiac fibrosis (A) and WB assay
  of cardiac fibrosis biomarkers, including collagen I (B, D) and collagen III (C,
  E), of the isolated heart in all groups. *p < 0.05 versus control group; #p < 0.05
  versus I/R group; Δp < 0.05 versus 34H+DMSO group. &p < 0.05 versus 34H+3‐TYP group.'
article_title: Therapeutic hypothermia alleviates myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion
