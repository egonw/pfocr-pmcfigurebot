caption: 'Effects of SCE-E on expression of antioxidant-related gene and phosphorylation
  of ERK/AKT signaling in glutamate-induced oxidative stress. (A) Gene expression
  of Creb, Bdnf, Nrf2, catalase, Sod1, and Sod2. (B) Western blot for pERK, ERK, pAKT,
  AKT, and Nrf2 in time-course in glutamate and SCE-E-treated cells. Data for gene
  expression are expressed as the mean Â± SEM. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. Con; * p <
  0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. Glutamate. N = 3. Con: Control; GLU: glutamate; SCE-E: SCE
  EtOAc fraction; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK: phosphorylated
  ERK; pAKT: phosphorylated AKT; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2.'
