caption: 'PUE reduced neurological scores and alleviated neuronal damage in MCAO/R
  rat brains. (A) PUE reduced the neurological score assessed by the Zea Longa test
  after cerebral I/R (n = 10). (B) Representative images of TTC staining. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of cerebral infarction volume (n = 3). (D) The morphological alterations
  of cells in the hippocampal CA1 region were measured by HE staining (×400). (E)
  The morphological alterations of cells in the hippocampal CA1 region were examined
  by Nissl staining (×400). (a) Sham group; (b) model group; (c) PUE (25 mg/kg) group;
  (d) PUE (50 mg/kg) group; (e) PUE (100 mg/kg) group; (f) edaravone. The scale bar
  was 20 µm. All data were expressed as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01 vs. sham group, *p <
  0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. model group.'
