caption: 'SGLT2 Inhibitors Versus GLP-1RAs on Kidney and Heart FailureThe bars represent
  absolute effects of treatment per 1,000 patients treated for 5 years for patients
  at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (3 or more cardiovascular
  risk factors), moderate risk (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), high risk
  (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (atherosclerotic vascular disease plus
  chronic kidney disease). (A) Kidney failure: SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared
  with placebo. (B) Kidney failure: SGLT2 inhibitor compared with GLP-1RA. (C) Hospitalization
  for heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1RA compared with placebo. (D) Hospitalization
  for heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitor compared with GLP-1RA. Data adapted from Palmer
