caption: Effect of silibinin on the mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Silibinin effectively
  downregulated the mTOR pathway, including mTOR and its key components—p70S6K, S6,
  and 4E-BP1—in both HDFs and KFs. (B–E) Results of quantitative analysis. The data
  are presented as a ratio of the signal intensity of the phosphorylated form to the
  total form. n = 3 (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns, non-significant).
