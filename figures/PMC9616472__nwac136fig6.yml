caption: Metabolomic profiling of MII oocytes from WT and Polgm mice. (A) Flow diagram
  of metabolome analysis in oocytes. Nineteen- to 21-week-old mice were used for MII
  oocyte collection (300 oocytes per sample, two samples for each group). (B) Heat
  map showing the 30 differential metabolites between WT and Polgm oocytes. (C) OPLS-DA
  score plot model separating WT and Polgm oocytes. R2X = 0.746, indicating 74.6%
  of the variation in the data set could be modeled by the selected components; Q2 = 0.932,
  indicating a high predictive accuracy. (D) Schematic representation of interconnected
  metabolic pathways associated with differentially enriched metabolites in WT and
  Polgm oocytes. Metabolites increased in Polgm oocytes are indicated by red filled
  triangles and metabolites decreased in Polgm oocytes are marked by red empty triangles.
  (E)–(J) Relative levels of metabolites related to the transsulfuration pathway and
  TCA cycle. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis in all panels.
