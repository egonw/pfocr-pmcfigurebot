caption: Leptin and endocannabinoids reciprocally regulate sweet taste signaling.
  The receptors for leptin and endocannabinoids are expressed in STR-expressing cells.
  Leptin signaling through the Ob-Rb receptor activates the PI3Kâ€“AKT signaling pathway
  in sweet taste cells to activate the KATP channel, thereby reducing the sensitivity
  of STR-expressing cells. Endocannabinoids signal through the CB1 receptor that is
  also expressed in these cells, to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, causing cAMP depletion
  and disinhibition of STR signaling. The action of these and other hormones regulates
  sweet taste signaling and behavioral responses to sweet tastants.
