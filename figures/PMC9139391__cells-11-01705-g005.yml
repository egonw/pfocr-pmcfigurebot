caption: Effects on the Annexin A1 (AnxA1) expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157
  after the stimulation and inhibition of the IL-6 pathway. The cropped Western blotting
  of AnxA1 expression in the cytoplasm (C), nuclei (N), and supernatants (S) of MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-157 cells. (A) Cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μM of recombinant human
  IL-6 (rIL-6). (B) Cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μM of neutralizing antibody
  anti-human IL-6 (Tocilizumab; TCZ), and (C) cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μM
  of an inhibitor of the IL-6 signaling pathway molecule, STAT3 (STATTIC; STC). β-Actin
  and Lamin B2 were used to check the proper cell fractionation and as loading controls
  of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively. Three independent experiments
  were performed.
