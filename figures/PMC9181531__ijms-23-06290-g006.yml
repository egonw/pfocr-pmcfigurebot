caption: TPO failed to activate STAT3 signal pathway of MEG-01 cells in the presence
  of carboplatin. (A,B) MEG-01 cells were treated by TPO for 0–60 min and the expressions
  of JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 were determined by the western blot method. (C,D) MEG-01
  cells were pretreated with carboplatin for 24 h, then by TPO for 0–60 min and the
  expressions of JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 were determined by western blot method. (*
  p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001, **** p-value < 0.0001).
