caption: 'rhALR downregulated the expression of TLR4 and endogenous ligands after
  I/R injury. (a, b) TLR4 mRNA expression after renal I/R injury was measured by immunohistochemical
  (magnification, ×200) and real-time PCR methods, respectively. TLR4 expression was
  increased markedly in kidneys after rat I/R injury. Intraperitoneal injection of
  rhALR markedly decreased the expression of TLR4 vs. I/R+saline. TLR4 protein expression
  in untreated control cells was low. (c) The endogenous ligand mRNA expression began
  to increase since 24 h and reached the peak at 72 h following I/R injury. Expression
  of these mRNA downregulation in I/R+rhALR1 and I/R+rhALR2 at the same points. All
  data were shown as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 vs. sham, #P < 0.05 vs. I/R+saline.'
