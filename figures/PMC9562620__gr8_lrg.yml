caption: 'Effect of XFBD on the expression of p–NF–κB p65 and COX-2 protein in LPS-induced
  RAW264.7 cells. (A) p–NF–κB p65 protein was determined by immunofluorescence staining.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. (B) Results were expressed of p–NF–κB p65. (C) Expression levels
  of p–NF–κB p65, NF-κB p65 and COX-2 were determined by western blotting. (D) Results
  were expressed as the ratios of p–NF–κB p65/NF-κB p65 and COX-2/β-actin, respectively.
  Data are shown as mean ± SD by ANOVA. n = 3. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs control group,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs LPS group.'
