caption: Effects of Different Dosage Sucrose on Symptoms of DSS-induced Colitis in
  Mice. (A) Schematic diagram of animal experiment design. (B) Oral glucose tolerance
  test (OGTT) after different doses of sucrose intervention for 3 weeks. (C) Alteration
  of body weight during DSS modeling. (D) Change of disease activity index. (E) Representative
  colonic photographs and colon length. (F) Colon length. The data were represented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 8). Analysis of weight and OGTT in experiments were performed
  by two-way ANOVA with Turkey post-hoc multiple comparisons. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.
