caption: Effects of VDR on inflammatory cytokine expression in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2
  cells. Sub-confluent cells were incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, and
  then the cells were collected for Western blotting analysis or continued to be infected
  with PEDV (1 MOI). After 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed with PBS and then
  cultured with or without 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for further 24 h. Then, the cells were
  collected for Western blotting analysis (A). After the IPEC-J2 cells were transfected
  with VDR siRNA for 24 h, 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) was supplemented for another 24 h,
  and then cells were infected with PEDV (1 MOI) and cultured for a further 24 h.
  Finally, the cells were harvested for RT-qPCR tests (B). The pcDNA3.1-VDR was transfected
  into IPEC-J2 cells by Lipofectamine 3000 reagent and cultured for 24 h, after which
  the cells were infected by PEDV and cultured for a further 24 h. Then, the cells
  were collected for RT-qPCR analysis (C). * p < 0.05.
