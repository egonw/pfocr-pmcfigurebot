caption: Morphological changes of HepG2 cells at 40 × 10 magnifications. (A) Normal
  HepG2 cells. (B) Cells treated with 450 μM (IC25) n-3 PUFAs, only slight morphological
  changes were present. (C) Cells treated with 900 μM (IC50) n-3 PUFAs are detached,
  and the numbers of apoptotic bodies and cell shrinkage increased. The results are
  from one representative experiment of the three independently performed experiments
  that showed similar patterns.
