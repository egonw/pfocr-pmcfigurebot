caption: A potential model of GCN2-mediated translation regulation for low-temperature
  fruiting after long postripening (LFLP) in H. marmoreus. Low temperature stimulated
  the GCN2-mediated eIF2 translation pathway with the enriched amino acids and ATP
  in LFLP, which are essential for promoting global translation. The synergistically
  increased citrate and Arg may promote amino acid synthesis and ATP production for
  global translation in H. marmoreus.
