caption: Activation of the glucocorticoid pathway upon different stimulations. CYP11B1
  and MC2R gene expression upon ACTH (A,B) and FSK (C,D), respectively, per cell line.
  Hormonal production of cortisol (E) in ng per mg of total protein for unstimulated
  cells in comparison with KCl, AngII, FSK and two different ACTH stimulations. Activation
  of intermediate steroidogenesis steps upon different stimulations. CYP21A2 gene
  expression upon FSK stimulation (F) per cell line. Hormonal production of 11- (G)
  and 21-deoxycortisol (H) in ng per mg of total protein for unstimulated cells in
  comparison with KCl, AngII, FSK and two different ACTH stimulations. Stars represent
  significance vs. untreated cells (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
