caption: UDSCs suppress fibrosis in HK-2 cells via the TGF-β/ERK signaling pathway.
  (A) In total, 10 ng/mL TGF- β1-treated HK-2 were co-cultured with normal UDSCs or
  si-Klotho UDSCs for 72 h. The TGF-β/ERK signaling pathway was analyzed by Western
  blotting using HK-2 cell lysates. (B) Klotho expressions were analyzed by Western
  blotting using HK-2 cell lysates. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM. * p <
  0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. Control. (C) Schematic diagram of the mechanism of UDSC-derived
  Klotho.
