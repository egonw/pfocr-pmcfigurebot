caption: The moderating effect of the interaction of cigarette smoking status (yes/no)
  and QSM measures in the ROIs on clinical performance in PD patients, with covariates
  of TIV and age. The slopes changed with the moderator variable of smoking status
  and exhibited significant interactions illustrated by crossed lines in disordinal
  forms. (A,B) For non-smokers (blue line) the relationships between the QSM values
  of the left thalamus and the UPDRS total scores and rigidity severity were positive
  (the regression line slopes upwards), whereas for smokers (red line), the relationship
  was negative (the regression line slopes downwards). (C) In non-smokers (blue line),
  the relationship between the QSM values of the left SNc and the H&Y stages was negative
  but for smokers (red line) the relationship was positive. QSM, the quantitative
  susceptibility mapping; ROI, regions of interest; PD, Parkinson’s disease; SD, standard
  deviation; TIV, total intracranial volume; UPDRS, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating
  Scale; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta.
