caption: 'LEFTY-NODAL Signaling Pathway is Essential for hPGCLCs Differentiation.
  A Scheme of hPGC differentiation through iMeLCs in vitro; SB431524: NODAL signaling
  inhibitor; ACTA (Activin A): NODAL signaling stimulator; B Bright field (BF) and
  fluorescence images of day4 embryoids stimulated by cytokines and with or without
  SB431542 in iMeLCs or hPGCLCs induction. Scale bar = 100 μm; C FACS patterns show
  the induction efficiency of hPGCs with or without SB431542 at iMeLCs or hPGCLCs
  induction; D FACS analysis of WT and TKO hESCs in day4 hPGCLCs induction with cytokines
  and different concentration of Activin A; E FACS analysis of WT and TKO hESCs in
  day4 hPGCLCs induction with different concentration of Activin A and without cytokines;
  F mRNA expression was assayed in day4 embryoids treated with different concentration
  of Activin A without cytokines using qRT-PCR assay, the WT day4 hPGCLCs were used
  as positive control; n = 3 independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± s.d'
