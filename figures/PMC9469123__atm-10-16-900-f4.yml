caption: 'Effects of ZGZT on blood calcium, B-ALP, PINP and CTX levels in rats. (A)
  Compared with the control group, blood calcium in the PMOP group was significantly
  reduced. After intervention, the serum calcium content the PMOP + ZGZT and PMOP
  + E2 group increased significantly compared with the PMOP group. (B,C) PINP and
  B-ALP showed the same trend. The expression levels of PINP and B-ALP in the PMOP
  group were decreased compared with that in the control group, and the expression
  levels of PINP and B-ALP in the PMOP + ZGZT and PMOP + E2 group were up-regulated
  after intervention, but there was no statistical significance. (D) There was no
  significant change in CTX in the PMOP group, and the expression of CTX in the PMOP
  + ZGZT group was decreased. (E) The number of TRAP staining positive cells in the
  PMOP group was significantly increased, the number of positive cells in the PMOP
  + ZGZT group was not significantly different from that in the control group, and
  the number of positive cells in the PMOP + E2 group was increased compared with
  that in the control group, but significantly lower than that in the PMOP group.
  **P<0.01, compared with the control group; #P<0.05, compared with the PMOP group.
  PINP, procollagen 1 intact N-terminal propeptide; B-ALP, bone alkaline phosphatase;
  CTX, C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen; PMOP, postmenopausal osteoporosis; ZGZT,
  Zhuanggu Zhitong; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; E2, estrogen.'
