caption: DSF/Cu induces unfolded protein response and inhibits protein degradation.
  (A) Pathway analysis between normal control and DSF/Cu-treated HCC cells. (B) Differential
  expression of unfolded protein response- and protein ubiquitination-related genes
  between normal control and DSF/Cu-treated HCC cells. (C) Western blot analysis of
  ER stress and poly-ubiquitylated proteins in LM3, Huh7, and Hepa1–6 cells after
  the treatment of DSF/Cu. (D) Fluorescence imaging of NPL4, cell nuclei were stained
  by DAPI. Images with magnification at 800× are shown here. (E) Western blot analysis
  of cytoplasmic and nuclear NPL4 in DSF/Cu-treated LM3 cells. The uncropped blots
  are shown in .
