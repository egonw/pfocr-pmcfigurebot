caption: Involvement of PLD in OA-induced filopodia formation and TNBC cell migration.
  (A) Representative confocal microscopy images of PASS-GFP in response to BSA (Ctrl)
  or 100 μM OA treatment for 10 min in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. (B) Quantification
  of the fluorescence intensity of PASS-GFP on the plasma membrane (PM) relative to
  the cytoplasm. (C) Colocalization of Cdc42 and PLD2 in TNBC cell lines. Cells were
  treated with BSA (Ctrl) or 100 μM OA for 10 min, and subsequently stained with PLD2
  antibody (red) and Cdc42 antibody (green). (D) Quantification of Cdc42 and PLD2
  colocalization using Pearson’s coefficient. (E) Induction of filopodia formation
  in TNBC cells by PMA. Cells were treated with BSA (Ctrl) or 10 ng/mL PMA for 10
  min, and subsequently stained with DAPI (blue) and Phalloidin-TRITC (red). (F) Representative
  light-microscopy images of wound healing assays for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.
  Wound healing was evaluated over a 24 h period following treatment with BSA (Ctrl)
  or in the presence of PMA (10 ng/mL) and Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 (5 μM). (G) Quantification
  of wound closure in (F). The average (±standard deviation) percentage of wound closure
  was calculated from 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined
  via the Student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). The scale bars
  featured apply uniformly to all images within their sets.
