caption: Spragueâ€“Dawley (SD) rats were administered with 8 weeks of different dietary
  interventions followed by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) or citric
  acid-sodium citrate buffer, and the dietary treatment was continued for 8 weeks
  after the successful establishment of the diabetic rats model, meanwhile intraperitoneal
  injection of exogenous sulfur dioxide (SO2) donor (Na2SO3/NaHSO3) or equivalent
  saline for 8 weeks. DC, diabetic cardiomyopathy.
