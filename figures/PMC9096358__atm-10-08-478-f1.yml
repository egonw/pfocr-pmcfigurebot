caption: CB inhibited the development of CRC in vivo. (A) A schematic diagram of the
  AOM/DSS-induced CRC model in C57BL/6J mice with CB treatment. (B) Images of colon
  tumors in mice before grouping. (C) Representative images of colon tumors in mice
  under different conditions. (D,E) Statistical analysis of tumor number and volume
  in different groups, n=5/group by Student’s t test. Error bars represent mean ±
  SEM; **P<0.01. (F) Representative histological appearance of the tumors in the 2
  groups. The section of tissue was stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Scale bar, 50
  µm. AOM, azoxymethane; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium salt; Ctrl, control group; CB,
  Clostridium butyricum; CRC, colorectal cancer.
article_title: Clostridium butyricum inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer
  and alleviates intestinal inflammation via the myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
