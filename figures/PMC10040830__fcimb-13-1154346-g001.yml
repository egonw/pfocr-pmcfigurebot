caption: The genome of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is rich in tryptophan metabolism
  genes. (A) The primary tryptophan metabolites and metabolic network. The host pathway
  is represented by black, and the microbial pathway is represented by blue. (B) The
  heatmap represents the sequence identity of the best hit of the tryptophan metabolism
  genes in LAB strains. Genes with more than 30% identity are considered homologous
  sequences.
