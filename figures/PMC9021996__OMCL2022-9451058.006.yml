caption: A schematic diagram of the effects of EPA in macrophages. In ox-LDL-induced
  foam cells, EPA suppressed miR-1a-3p activity, thus increasing the expression of
  sFRP1, which downregulated the activation of the Wnt/PCP-JNK axis. Therefore, inflammatory
  responses and oxidative stress were suppressed in atherosclerosis.
