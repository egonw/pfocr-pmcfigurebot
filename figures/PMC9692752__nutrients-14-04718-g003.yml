caption: 'The effects of SWCA extract on gene and protein expressions of gut-derived
  serotonin-related signaling pathway in femur. (A) Gene expression; (B) protein expression.
  The rats were orally administrated with vehicle (Sham, OVX), 140 mg/kg SWCA extract
  (CAL), 280 mg/kg SWCA extract (CAH) or intramuscularly injected with 1.8 μg/kg Teriparatide
  (PTH) for 10 weeks. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, n = 8–10. # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 vs. Sham, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. OVX by one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.'
