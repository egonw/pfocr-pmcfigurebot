caption: 'Effect of NET1 overexpression on cardiac fibroblasts(A) Western blot was
  used to detect the protein expression levels of NET1, FN-1, and collagen I in cardiac
  fibroblasts transfected with NET1 overexpression plasmid, n = 4, ∗p = 0.0286 NET1
  vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test. qRT-PCR was used to detect NET1, COL1A1 in fibroblasts
  and COL3A3 mRNA expression levels. n = 4–5, ∗p = 0.0286, ∗p = 0.0286, ∗∗p = 0.0079
  NET1 vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test.(B) Fibroblast viability was detected by MTT
  assay, n = 9, ∗p = 0.0244 NET1 vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test.(C) The expression
  of myofibroblast marker α-SMA was detected by immunofluorescence (n = 5, ∗∗p = 0.0079)
  and western blot (n = 8, ∗∗p = 0.0019). NET1 vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test, Scale
  bar: 50 μm, magnification 200×.(D) Fibroblast migration was detected by cell scratch
  assay. n = 4, ∗p = 0.0286 NET1 vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test.(E) Fibroblast proliferation
  detected by Edu kit. Scale bar: 50 μm, magnification 200×, n = 3, p = 0.1000 NET1
  vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test.(F) Western blot was used to detect the protein
  level of β-catenin. n = 4, ∗p = 0.0286 NET1 vs. Vector by Mann Whitney test. For
  all statistical plots, the data are presented as mean ± SEM.(G) Confocal microscopy
  was used to detect the expression of β-catenin in the nuclei of fibroblasts transfected
  with NET1 overexpression plasmid and Vector. Scale bar: 10 μm.'
