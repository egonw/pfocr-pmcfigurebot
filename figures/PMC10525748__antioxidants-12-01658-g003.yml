caption: 'PAK1 facilitates PGC1α gene expression. (A–C) PAK1-depleted (siPAK1) or
  control-transfected (siCTRL) L6.GLUT4myc myotubes showing qPCR quantification of
  PAK1 mRNA expression (A) and corresponding PGC1α mRNA expression (B). Representative
  immunoblot (top) and quantitation (bottom) of PGC1α protein levels (C). (D–F) GFP-tagged
  PAK1-enriched (PAK1) or control (CTRL) L6.GLUT4myc myotubes showing qPCR quantification
  of PAK1 mRNA expression (D) and corresponding PGC1α mRNA expression (E). Representative
  immunoblot (top) and quantitation (bottom) of PGC1α protein levels (F). (G–J) L6.GLUT4myc
  myotubes transduced to express PAK1 with Ad-MYC-hPAK1 (PAK1-OE) post-insulin stimulation
  for 20 min. CTRL, control vector. (G) Confocal immunofluorescent images showing
  PAK1 localization; scale bar = 20 μm (top), bottom inset: 6× zoom of original magnification
  in the boxed area. Blue: DAPI nuclear stain. Red: PAK1. (H–J) Representative immunoblot
  (H) and quantitation of PAK1 localized to the non-nuclear (I) vs. nuclear (J) fraction.
  In each independent experiment, control was set equal to 100% and other samples
  normalized thereto. Bars represent the mean ± SEM from 3–4 independent experiments.
  Circle and square symbols in the bar graphs represent the number of independent
  cell passages used. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test).
  β-Actin was used as the loading control for normalization of gene expression analysis
  and ponceau was used as the loading control for normalization of immunoblots.'
