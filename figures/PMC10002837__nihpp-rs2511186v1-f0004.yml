caption: a) Box and whisker plot depicting the change in relative abundance of the
  metabolite sphinganine with legend shown below indicating sample group by colour.
  Darker lines in the body of the box depict the mean line and error bars show quartile
  ranges from the mean. b) Heat map depicting the most significantly perturbed pathway
  between [rnqâˆ’] and [RNQ+], following the removal of pathways implicated as being
  involved in loss of function and overall stress response. Pathway names and individual
  metabolites are shown on the left and overlaid data for each data set (n=6) is shown
  under its respective grouping. Upregulation is shown is dark orange, through to
  no change in grey and downregulation in dark blue.
