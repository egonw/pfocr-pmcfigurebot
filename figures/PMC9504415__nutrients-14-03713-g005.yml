caption: Effect of pinostrobin on the phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK in B16F10
  cells. (a–d) Cells were treated with pinostrobin at various concentrations for 24
  h and then harvested. p-p38, p-ERK, and p-JNK, were analyzed by Western blotting.
  Blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Protein levels were normalized to the
  corresponding loading controls. The untreated cells were regarded as 100%. Values
  are expressed represent as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *** p
  < 0.001 ** p < 0.01, and * p < 0.05 compared with control group. NS; not significant.
