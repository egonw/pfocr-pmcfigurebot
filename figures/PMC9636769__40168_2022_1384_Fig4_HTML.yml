caption: The compositions of viral community-wide AMGs across three habitats. Bubble
  sizes show the number of enriched AMG functions (KOs) belonging to specific functional
  pathway in each habitat. The enriched KOs were determined by the Kruskal–Wallis
  test (P < 0.05) based on their relative abundance in the lytic (a, b) and temperate
  (c) viral communities among three habitats. FL, free-living; PA, particle-attached;
