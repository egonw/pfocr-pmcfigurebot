caption: 'FOXF2 activates the Wnt signaling pathway in luminal breast cancer cells
  but inhibits that in BLBC cells by directly targeting WNT2B and FZD1.A, the indicated
  cells were cotransfected with TOP/FOP flash and Renilla pRL-TK plasmids for 48 h
  and then subjected to a dual-luciferase reporter assay to detect Wnt signaling pathway
  activity. The ratio of TOPflash to FOPflash was analyzed. B, nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin in the indicated cells was analyzed by immunoblot. WC: whole-cell extracts;
  Cy: cytoplasmic extracts; Nu: nuclear extracts. C, the binding of FOXF2 to the WNT2B
  and FZD1 promoters containing the putative binding sites in the indicated cells
  transfected with FOXF2-FLAG plasmids was assessed by ChIP-qPCR assays. D, the transcriptional
  activity of the WNT2B and FZD1 promoters in the indicated cells was evaluated by
  a dual-luciferase reporter assay. pGL3-WNT2B or pGL3-FZD1 promoter luciferase reporter
  construct containing or lacking the FOXF2-binding element was transfected into the
  indicated cells. E and F, the mRNA (E) and protein (F) levels of WNT2B and FZD1
  in the indicated cells were detected by RT-qPCR and immunoblot. ∗, p < 0.05 compared
  with control cells. BLBC, basal-like breast cancers; ChIP-qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative
  PCR; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.'
