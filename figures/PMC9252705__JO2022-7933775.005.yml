caption: The anticancer effect of neferine on thyroid cancer was associated with the
  Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway. IHH-4 and CAL-62 cells were treated with Nrf2, neferine,
  or their combination. (a) The apoptosis rate was examined by flow cytometry. (b)
  The invaded cell numbers were determined by transwell assays. (c) The ROS level
  was measured by flow cytometry after IHH-4 and CAL-62 cells were hatched with DCHF-DA.
  (d) The levels of GSH were analyzed by using the commercial kit. (e) The relative
  iron level was detected by an iron assay kit. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. All assays
  were performed in triplicate.
