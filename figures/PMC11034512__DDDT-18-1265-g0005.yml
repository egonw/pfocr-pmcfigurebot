caption: 'OB treatment promoted microglial polarization toward the M2 phenotype in
  CFA mice. (A–E) The protein content of M1 microglial markers (CD86, iNOS), M2 microglial
  markers (Arg-1, IL-10) were measured by Western blot. The data obtained are represented
  as the means ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs control group. ##P < 0.01 vs CFA group,
  n = 5 per group.'
