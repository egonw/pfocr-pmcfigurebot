figure_title: Mechanisms Regulating HLA Class-I Antigen Processing Machinery Component
  Expression in Cancer Cells
caption: HLA class-I APM components are involved in the synthesis and expression of
  HLA class-I trimolecular complexes. Their expression is regulated by transcription
  factors IRF1 and NF-κB, as well as enhanceosome transactivator NLRC5. Overexpression
  and/or activation of histone deacetylases, DNA methyltransferases, and polycomb
  repressive complex 2 (PRC2) enzymatic component EZH2 may reduce DNA accessibility
  of HLA class-I APM component promoter/enhancer regions, preventing transcription
  factors from binding. Activating mutations or amplifications in the receptor tyrosine
  kinase/MAPK signaling pathway may inactivate STAT1, downregulating IRF1, NLRC5,
  and HLA class-I APM component expression. MAPK activation may also inactivate STAT3,
  leading to HLA class-I APM component downregulation. Type I and type II interferons
  upregulate HLA class-I APM component expression through JAK/STAT1 activation. cGAS,
  a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and
  downstream TBK1/IKKε, may also induce HLA class-I APM component transcription. IRF3/IRF7-dependent
  type I interferon secretion represents one of the underlying mechanisms. The other
  mechanism is canonical NF-κB activation. The latter is also induced by tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNFα) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) agonists.
  Non-canonical NF-κB activation mediated by binding of ligands to TNF receptor superfamily
  members can also induce HLA class-I APM component transcription. Post-translationally,
  autophagy receptor NBR1 mediates HLA class-I trimolecular complex degradation via
  the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, while secreted enzyme PCSK9 mediates degradation
  of HLA class-I trimolecular complexes via the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.
