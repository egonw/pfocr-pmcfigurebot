caption: 'A) Basis of chemical synthetic study: The conversion of DAHP to 3‐dehydroquinate
  (DHQ) by DHQS and inhibitors 1 and C1: 7dSh (1) as representative of C7‐deoxy sugars,
  and C1 for the class of carbaphosphonates ((1i) Arabidopsis thaliana, control; (1ii)
  7dSh applied). B) Synthetic carbaphosphonates (C1−C3). DHQS is inhibited since β‐elimination
  is impaired.'
