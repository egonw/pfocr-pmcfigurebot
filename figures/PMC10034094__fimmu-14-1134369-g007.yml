caption: Differential metabolic pathways. (A), the plot of differential metabolic
  pathways of HC vs. ME; (B), the plot of differential metabolic pathways of HC vs.
  PUD; (C), the plot of differential metabolic pathways of ME vs. PUD; (D), the histogram
  of predicted metabolic pathways of the flora based on PICRUSt2 and KEGG database.
  Impact, the value of weight calculation based on topological analysis; larger Impact,
  more significant Pathway; Total, total number of metabolites in the target metabolic
  pathway; Hits, number of differential metabolites in the target metabolic pathway;
  p-value, hypergeometric distribution test.
