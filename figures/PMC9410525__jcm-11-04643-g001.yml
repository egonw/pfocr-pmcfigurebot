caption: 'The MEK/ERK pathway represents the hub that connects many pathogenic factors
  involved in the onset of multiple sclerosis: inflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration.
  VEGF, via interaction with its receptor VEGFR, is the key protein that activates
  angiogenesis in response to inflammatory stimuli and is known to be neuroprotective.
  VEGF activates the downstream MEK/ERK pathway and is the main target of the current
  anti-angiogenic therapies. Moreover, ERK can be also activated in other ways, for
  example in microglial cells, thus contributing to inflammation and oligodendrocytesâ€™
  alterations.'
