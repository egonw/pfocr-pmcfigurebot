caption: 'Direct effects of LPS on the TLR4 signalling pathway in H9c2 cells. A –
  Representative pictures of Western blots, with each signal indicated. Quantified
  protein levels were calculated for TLR4 (B), JAK2 (C), and STAT3 (D). E – Changes
  in the cardiac contractile protein myosin light chain (MLC)-2 were compared. F –
  LPS (5 μg/ml) increased cellular calcium accumulation, which was suppressed by inhibitors
  including GIT-27, AG490, and Stattic at the indicated concentrations*P < 0.05 and
  **p < 0.01 vs. the vehicle-treated control (first column). #P < 0.05 vs. another
  LPS-treated group (second column), n = 4.'
article_title: The direct effect of lipopolysaccharide on an isolated heart is different
  from the effect on cardiac myocytes in vitro.
