figure_title: VIR3 is a component of MEcPP signal transduction pathway
caption: (A) Representative images of 2-week-old wild-type (WT), ceh1, Rceh4, ceh1/vir3-1,
  ceh1/vir3-2, ceh1/vir3-1/VIR3OE, vir3-1, and vir3-1/VIR3OE seedlings grown in long
  days (16-hour light/8-hour dark) (top) and the corresponding dark-field images displaying
  pHPL::LUC activity (bottom). (B) Seedling diameter and (C) MEcPP and (D) SA levels
  of the aforementioned genotypes based on fresh weight (FW) of tissue. Data (B to
  D) are means ± SEM for each genotype with at least three biological replicates.
  Letters above bars indicate significant differences determined by one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (P < 0.05). (E) Gene
  and protein structures of VIR3. Black boxes represent exons, lines represent introns
  and untranslated regions, and nucleotide and amino acid changes are displayed on
  the top or at the bottom of the top bar. The VIR3 transmembrane domains (TM) and
  the conserved zinc-binding domain (HEAGH) are shown on the bottom panel bar.
