caption: Transcriptional changes after blockage of the BMP signaling pathwayA. The
  schematic illustrating the in vitro culture and blockade of the BMP signaling pathway
  in male testicular cells. B. Two-dimensional embedding of cultured 15 W testicular
  cells using UMAP. The cells are colored according to cell type. The shapes represent
  cells subjected to different treatments. FGCs are highlighted with a black dashed
  circle. The shadow roughly frames the LDN-treated cells. C. Boxplots showing the
  expression level [log2 (TPM + 1)] of germ cell marker genes (NANOG, DAZL, and POU5F1),
  BMP signaling pathway-related genes (SMAD6, RBL1, MYC, ID1, ID2, and ID3), RA-synthesizing
  genes (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3), and a WNT signaling pathway-related gene
  (WNT3) in mitotic arrest FGCs and mitotic FGCs. Different colors represent different
  experimental treatments. LDN, BMP signaling pathway inhibitor; STRT-seq, single-cell
  tagged reverse transcription sequencing.
