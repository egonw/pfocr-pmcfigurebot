figure_title: Effects of MTOR and AKT pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated
  knockdown of MTOR on cell metabolism
caption: RCH-ACV bioenergetics studies were performed in supplemented medium. OCR
  kinetic reads were taken in 6 min intervals with the first injection after four
  reads for basal OCR, followed by six reads per inhibitor treatment. A Basal OCR
  and ECAR of RCH-ACV cells after 24 h pretreatment with torin-1, capivasertib or
  everolimus compared to cells treated with the vehicle. B Fold change in dependency
  on glucose, fatty acids and glutamine for mitochondrial respiration of cells pretreated
  for 24 h with the indicated inhibitor to DMSO treated cells. Statistical analysis
  by Student t test assuming a normal distribution. C Fold change of shMTOR knockdown
  cells to shLuc control cells in dependency on glucose, fatty acids and glutamine
  for mitochondrial fuel oxidation. Dependency was calculated from the difference
  in basal OCR and OCR after blocking the individual pathway divided by basal OCR
  less OCR after all inhibitors with sequential injections of 2 mM UK5099, 4 mM etomoxir
  and 3 mM BPTES, respectively. Data represent mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  D OCR (left panel) and ECAR (right panel) plots during the Mito Fuel Flex Test to
  determine glutamine dependency of RCH-ACV cells pretreated with the indicated substances
  for 24 h. Dashed lines indicate injection timepoints of the labeled inhibitors.
  Mean ± SD of one representative experiment with four technical replicates is shown.
  OCR Oxygen Consumption Rate, ECAR Extracellular Acidification Rate, Eto Etomoxir.
