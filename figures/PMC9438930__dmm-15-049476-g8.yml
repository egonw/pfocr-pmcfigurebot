caption: Transcript levels of members of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway after
  0.5% ECVE exposure during VF epithelial regeneration. Transcript levels of WNT2,
  WNT7B, CTNNB1 (β-catenin), LEF1 and CCND1 (cyclin D1) in control, PG/VG and PG/VG+FN
  experimental groups at different stages of VF epithelial recovery. Error bars with
  individual data points represent ±s.e.m. of the mean obtained from three biological
  replicates and technical replicates (n=3). One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test were
  used to confirm statistical significance in gene expression; *P≤0.05.
