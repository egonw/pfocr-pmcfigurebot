caption: Schematic diagram of the calcium signaling pathway following biotic attack.
  After an attack, resistance elicitors are released in herbivore oral secretions
  (OS), precipitated, and bound to receptors, causing a rapid increase in calcium
  cytosolic ([Ca2+] cyt) content. Calcium channels and ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps in
  the cell membrane and cell organelles (e.g., mitochondria, vacuoles, and endoplasmic
  reticulum) organize Ca2+ ions inside and outside the cell/organelles. Greater increases
  in Ca2+ ions trigger potassium (K+) channel activation, causing plasma membrane
  potential (Vm) depolarization. Different calcium receptors (e.g., CBL–CIPK, calcineurin
  B-like protein- CBL interacting protein kinase, CML42/CML43, calmodulin-like proteins
  42/43, and CPK3/CPK13, calcium-dependent protein kinases3/13) increase to activate
  transcription factors, such as HSFB2A. Finally, transcriptional regulation in the
  nucleus induces plant herbivore defense (Modified from []).
