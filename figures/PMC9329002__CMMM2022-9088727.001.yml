caption: 'Overexpressed miR-135a-5p or inhibited TBK1 attenuates LPS-driven ALI and
  inflammatory response in mice. (a) Representative histopathological examination
  of mouse lung tissues by HE staining in LPS-driven group, LPS-driven group transfected
  with miR-135a-5p mimics, LPS-driven group transfected with si-TBK1, and corresponding
  NCs and the healthy controls. Scale bars: 25 μm, magnified 400x, n = 6 for each
  group. (b) Expression of miR-135a-5p by qRT-PCR. (c) mRNA of TBK1 was determined
  through RT-qPCR, and TBK1 proteomic content was evaluated using Western blotting.
  (d) IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 levels were determined through ELISA kits. P values
  were assessed through Student''s t test.'
