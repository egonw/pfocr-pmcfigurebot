caption: Effects of chronic ethanol and dietary soy isolate on Notch pathway protein
  expression. Duplex ELISAs were used to measure (A) Notch-1; (B) Jagged-1; (C) HES-1,
  and (D) HIF-1α (N = 12/group). Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
  secondary antibody and Amplex UltraRed soluble fluorophore. Results were normalized
  to large acidic ribosomal protein (RPLPO) (See Methods). Graphed data reflect the
  mean ± S.D. of immunoreactivity and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA tests () with
  post hoc Tukey tests. Significant p-Values are indicated above the bars. * p < 0.05.
