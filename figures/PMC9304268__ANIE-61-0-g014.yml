caption: MALDI‐TOF‐MS spectrum of linear PMMA (l‐PMMA) initiated by species 2, quenched
  after 24 h, showing one dominant set of peaks with an end group mass correlating
  to the expected mass of TPT, and ES unit, and a proton, supporting our claim that
  SN2‐type ring closure is improbable for the nucleophilic pathway. Shown chemical
  structures only represent one of several regiochemical possibilities.
