figure_title: Circ-Pank1 regulates the dopaminergic neuron damage by targeting miR-7a-5p/α-syn
caption: After si-circ-Pank1 and miR-7a-5p inhibitors and corresponding controls were
  transferred to the MN9D cell model treated with rotenone (n = 3), Western blot analysis
  of α-syn and TH protein levels (A–C, E). qRT–PCR detects the level of α-syn mRNA
  (D). Data are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
article_title: circ-Pank1 promotes dopaminergic neuron neurodegeneration through modulating
  miR-7a-5p/α-syn pathway in Parkinson’s disease.
