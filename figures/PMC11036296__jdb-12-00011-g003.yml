caption: 'Similar activities of dual-lipidated Shh and depalmitoylated ShhC variants.
  (A) Dual-lipidated ShhC, monolipidated C25SShhC, and unlipidated C25SShhN were solubilized
  from Disp-expressing Bosc23 cells in the presence of Scube2 and 10% FCS. The supernatant
  was first immunoblotted for quantification and protein normalization (inset). C3H10T1/2
  cells were then stimulated with the same aliquoted protein batches at two different
  concentrations (100% and 50%) to control for the possibility of (over)saturation
  of the pathway. Data were normalized to mock-treated C3H10T1/2 cells. ****: p <
  0.0001, n.s.: p > 0.999. (B) Immunoblotted proteins (inset) were used for quantification
  and normalization of Shh variant proteins and dually lipidated control R&D 8908-SH
  (inset, labelled brown in the graphs). All cholesteroylated proteins induced strong
  transcriptional increases of the Hh signaling targets Ptch1 and Gli1 in C3H10T1/2
  reporter cells (left), and non-lipidated C25SShhN was inactive, as expected. Transcriptional
  increases are expressed as a log2-fold increase in mRNA expression normalized to
  mock-treated cells. Mean values of two independent experiments are shown. The same
  trend was observed in NIH3T3 cells (right). Averaged data from three independent
  experiments are shown. Ptch1: ****: p < 0.0001, *: p = 0.026, n.s.: p = 0.35. Gli1:
  ****: p < 0.0001, n.s.: p > 0.05. (C) Consistent with their similar hydrophobicity,
  N-processed ShhC and unpalmitoylated C25SShhC induced similar gene expression profiles
  in C3H10T1/2 reporter cells (all p-values are not significant, p > 0.04). These
  are expressed as the difference in log2-fold mRNA expression, normalized to mock-treated
  cells, between ShhC and C25AShhC.'
