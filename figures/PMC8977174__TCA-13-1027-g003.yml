caption: ADAMDEC1 accelerates the progression of NSCLC via the PI3K/ AKT pathway in
  vitro. (a, b) Expression level of PI3K, p‐PI3K, AKT, p‐AKT, p38, and p‐p38 in the
  HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells of the five groups (CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shADAMDEC1
  and shADAMDEC1 groups) were determined by western blotting. (c–e) Densitometry analysis
  was performed to determine the protein expression. Data was normalized to GAPDH.
  All results were representative of three separate experiments. All results were
  representative of three separate experiments. **p < 0.01
article_title: Upregulation of ADAMDEC1 correlates with tumor progression and predicts
  poor prognosis in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
