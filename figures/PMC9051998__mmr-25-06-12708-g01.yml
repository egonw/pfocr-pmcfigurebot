caption: Effect of AWGP and KCWGP on differentiation in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 myoblasts
  were differentiated into myotubes for 5 days and then treated with AWGP or KCWGP
  (0.1, 1 or 2 mg/ml) or with metformin (2.5 mM) for 24 h. The expression of MyHC
  protein was determined by (A) western blotting and (B) the density of each target
  was calculated with the expression of β-actin. (C) Immunocytochemical staining;
  fluorescence microscopy images were captured at ×200 (scale bar=25 µM) with MyHC-positive
  cells (green) and DAPI (blue). The values from the triplicate of experiments are
  given as the mean ± standard error of mean. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs.
  N. AWGP, American wild ginseng pharmacopuncture; KCWGP, Korean cultivated wild ginseng
  pharmacopuncture; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; M, metformin-treated cells; N, untreated
  cells.
