caption: Insulin activates IRE1-XBP1s signaling in the liver of fasted mice.A–D, after
  12 h of fasting, mice were treated with vehicle or 1 unit/kg of insulin for 15 or
  30 min, then liver tissues were collected. The protein levels of XBP1 and phosphorylation
  levels of mediators in the insulin signaling pathway, canonical ER stress pathway,
  and MEK-ERK-p38 signaling were determined in immunoblots (A). Densitometric analysis
  of the phosphorylation levels of AKT, GSK, IRE1, and protein levels of XBP1s (B),
  phosphorylation levels of MEK, ERK, and p38 (C), phosphorylation levels of pPERK
  and eIF2a and ATF6 protein levels (D) (n = 3 ∼ 5). E, the mRNA levels of XBP1s and
  XBP1u in the liver. Densitometric analysis of the mRNA levels of XBP1s and XBP1u
  (n = 3 ∼ 5). Each lane represents an individual mouse sample (A, E). F and G, forty-eight hours
  after the addition of adenoviral expression vectors of XBP1s or XBP1u, Hepa1-6 cells
  were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 50 μg/ml) and harvested at the indicated time
  point. ∗p < 0.05, Student’s t test. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1, inositol-requiring
  enzyme; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; XBP1u, XBP1 from an unspliced form; XBP1s,
  XBP1 from a spliced form; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
