caption: Pathway analysis of eccDNA‐associated mRNAs. (A)(B) Seventy‐six upregulated
  pathways of differentially expressed eccDNA‐associated mRNAs were identified, including
  pathways related to systemic lupus erythematosus, alcoholism, type I diabetes mellitus,
  viral myocarditis, viral carcinogenesis, graft‐versus‐host disease, antigen processing
  and presentation, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), allograft
  rejection, toxoplasmosis, and others. (C)(D) Sixty‐eight downregulated pathways
  of differentially expressed eccDNA‐associated mRNAs were identified, including pathways
  related to systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, graft‐versus‐host
  disease, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
  (ARVC), allograft rejection, axon guidance, viral myocarditis, viral carcinogenesis,
  and others
