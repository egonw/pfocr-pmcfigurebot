caption: NR2F2 downstream genes and associated pathways in the GD3.5 mouse uterus.
  (A) A volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes between mutant and control
  uteri. The horizontal dotted line marks the unadjusted p value at 0.05. Vertical
  dotted lines label the fold change cutoff at 1.4 and -1.4. Selected genes of interest
  are marked in red with gene symbols displayed. N=4 for each group. (B) RT-qPCR validation
  of the relative RNA abundance of denoted genes. Each group has datapoints of 6 biological
  replicates with technical PCR duplicates. ***, p< 0.001 by two-tailed Mann Whitney
  test. Error bars denote the standard error of the mean. (C–E) Enrichment of NR2F2
  downstream genes in molecular pathways by GSEA. NES, normalized enrichment score;
  FDR, false discovery rate. (F) Selected inflammatory pathways that have over-representation
  of NR2F2 downstream genes in mouse and human, identified by the IPA Canonical Pathway
  Analysis. Pathways are grouped by hierarchical clustering of activation z-scores.
