caption: 'Ubenimex inhibits CD13/EMP3/FAK/NF-κB signalling pathway activity in SGC-7901/5-FU
  cells. (A) Associated protein expression was identified by western blot assay in
  SGC-7901/5-FU cells after CD13 was over-expressed. (B) Associated protein expression
  was identified by western blot assay in SGC-7901/5-FU cells after EMP3 was over-expressed.
  (C) Western blot analyses of associated protein expression in SGC-7901/5-FU cells
  treated with 0.06 or 0.12 mg/mL of ubenimex. (D) SGC-7901/5-FU cells were pretransfected
  with pEGFP-N1-CD13 plasmid for 24 h, and then stimulated with ubenimex (0.12 mg/mL)
  for another 24 h. Associated protein expression were detected by western blot assay.
  (E) SGC-7901/5-FU cells were pretransfected with pEGFP-N1-EMP3 plasmid for 24 h,
  and then stimulated with ubenimex (0.12 mg/mL) for another 24 h. Associated protein
  expression were detected by western blot assay. (F) Indicated cells were pre-treated
  with pEGFP-N1-CD13 plasmid or pTZU-CD13-shRNA plasmid for 24 h, followed by treatment
  with ubenimex (0.12 mg/mL) for another 24 h, indicated associated channel protein
  expression in SGC-7901/5-FU cells. GAPDH is shown as a loading control. Quantification
  was performed by a densitometry analysis and normalized to GAPDH levels. The bars
  indicate the means ± SD from the 3 independent experiments (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  ****P<0.0001, and #P>0.05). EMP3, epithelial membrane protein 3; FAK, focal adhesion
  kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; Ube,
  ubenimex; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; SD, standard deviation.'
