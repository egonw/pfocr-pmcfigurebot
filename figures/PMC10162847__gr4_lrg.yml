caption: Myricetin downregulates NF-κB signaling pathway in THP1 cells. (A-G) mRNA
  expression levels of NF-κBp65, RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD, MLKL, Caspase8, and JNK. (H)
  Western blot analysis of NF-κBp65, p-NF-κBp65, RIPK1, and p-RIPK1. THP1 cells are
  incubated with 0, 100, 200, and 400 μM myricetin followed by treatment with the
  LPS. NF-κBp65 is nuclear factor-κB p65; RIPK1 is receptor interacting serine/threonine
  kinase 1; RIPK3 is receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3; FADD is fas-associating
  protein with a novel death domain; MLKL is Mixed lineage kinase domain like; Caspase
  8 is cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8; JNK is c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. **p<0.01, *p<0.05 vs. the model group.
