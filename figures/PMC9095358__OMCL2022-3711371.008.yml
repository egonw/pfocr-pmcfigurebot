caption: 'TLR4 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of n-3 PUFA and MUFA
  on NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling in chondrocytes. The relative protein expression
  of collagen II, TLR4, p-NF-κB, and IL-1β in SW1353 cells treated with OLA (a) or
  DHA (b). The relative protein expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD in SW1353
  cells treated with OLA (c) or DHA (d). Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect
  the expression of caspase-1 (e, g) and GSDMD (f, h) in SW1353 cells treated with
  OLA or DHA (200x, scale bars = 100 μm). The data are presented as the means ± SD,
  n = 3. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus the NC group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus
  the groups without OE-TLR4-pretreatment; ^p < 0.05 and ^^p < 0.01 versus the NC+LPS
  group; &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 versus the NC+OLA or NC+DHA group.'
