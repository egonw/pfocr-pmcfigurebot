figure_title: PRSS22 binds to ANXA1 protein and promotes the cleavage of ANXA1 in
  BC cells
caption: A, B Transwell assays showed that PRSS22 protease-dead mutation plasmids
  lost their function in promoting migration and invasion (Scale bars, 100 μm). C
  Western blot assays were used to identify the overexpression efficiency of PRSS22-WT,
  PRSS22-R49A and PRSS22-C139A/D141E in BC cells. D Western blot assays showed that
  the overexpression efficiency of Flag tag (DYKDDDDK). E Western blot assays were
  used to verify that DYKDDDDK (Flag®) Tag Immunomagnetic Beads are able to precipitate
  PRSS22 protein. F Silver staining of the PRSS22-protein complex by incubation of
  PRSS22 with protein extracts from MDA-MB-231 cell. The line shows the differential
  band that was present when the protein extracts were incubated with PRSS22-WT compared
  with PRSS22-R49A and PRSS22-C139A/D141E. G Co-IP and Western blot assays were used
  to verify that PRSS22 specifically binds to ANXA1 in BC cells. H, I Western blot
  assay was performed to confirm that PRSS22-WT could promote the cleavage of ANXA1,
  whereas PRSS22-R49A or PRSS22-C139A/D141E have no obvious effect on the cleavage
  of ANXA1. The data of cleaved ANXA1 proteins are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. J Western blot assays showed that ANXA1 has no obvious effect on the
  expression level of PRSS22 protein. K, L Transwell assays showed that BC cells were
  co-transfected with PRSS22 and ANXA1 have stronger migration and invasion ability
  than those transfected with only PRSS22 or ANXA1 (Scale bars, 100 μm). Data are
  shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ns not significant.
