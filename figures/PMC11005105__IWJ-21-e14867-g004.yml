caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) enrichment analyses and protein‐protein
  interaction network (PPI) before and after hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. The
  functional and pathway enrichment analyses using DAVID software to gain a thorough
  understanding of the roles played by the 14 differentially regulated pathways identified
  in the wound healing process in Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) dataset through GSEA. Moreover,
  network maps of intestinal immunity (A–C) demonstrate significant enrichment of
  pathways such as EGFR1 pathway, as well as cellular and inflammatory cytokine response
  pathway.
