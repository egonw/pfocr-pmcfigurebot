caption: 'TQ significantly inhibited the protein release of IL-1β in PBMCs and TAMs
  of HR+ BC, respectively. (A–C) IL-1β protein level (pg/mL) released from PBMCs of
  HR+ BC patients treated with TQ concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for (A) 24
  h, (B) 48 h, and (C) 72 h. (D) IL-1β protein level (pg/mL) released from TAMs of
  HR+ BC patients treated with TQ concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) for 24 h.
  All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were expressed as the mean
  ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism
  software version 9.1.1. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparisons to compare each treated column and the DMSO control column
  (**** p value < 0.0001; *** p value < 0.001; ** p value < 0.01; * p < 0.05). TQ:
  thymoquinone; ns: non-significant; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; PBMCs: peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells; TAMs: tumor-associated macrophages, HR+: hormone receptor-positive;
  BC: breast cancer; IL-1β: interleukin-1 beta.'
