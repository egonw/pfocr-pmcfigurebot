caption: Proposed routes for thiamine biosynthesis in diatoms. (a) A tBlastn search
  using selected algal peptide sequences as queries (please refer to Supporting Information
  Table c) was performed against 19 diatom genomes to determine the presence (full
  circle P‐value > 10−20; half‐full circle P‐value > 10−3) or absence (empty circle)
  of different thiamine‐related genes. The presence of an associated predicted riboswitch
  in the 3′UTR of the gene is indicated with a hairpin symbol at the right of the
  circle. The genome abbreviations, accession numbers and references can be found
  in Table . (b) Potential thiamine biosynthetic, salvage and uptake routes in diatoms.
  The pathway steps with strong support across the diatom lineage are shown in green.
  AIR, 5‐aminoimidazole ribotide; dA, 5′‐deoxyadenosine; DXP, 1‐deoxy‐d‐xylulose 5‐phosphate;
  FAMP, N‐formyl‐4‐amino‐5‐aminomethyl‐2‐methylpyrimidine; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate;
  HET‐P, hydroxyethyl‐thiazole phosphate; HMP‐P, hydroxymethyl‐pyrimidine phosphate;
  HMP‐PP, hydroxymethyl‐pyrimidine pyrophosphate; l‐Met, l‐methionine; NAD, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; PLP, pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate; SAM, S‐adenosyl methionine; TMP,
  thiamine monophosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate. &THI5/NMT1 candidates contain
  an NMT1 Pfam domain (PF09084). $THIG and THIS are encoded in the chloroplast in
  Phaeodactylum tricornutum, so the results can be biased in genomes that do not include
  chloroplast sequences. +THID, THIE and HMPK functions are performed by a single
  peptide in diatoms (TH1). *In some bacteria TenI accelerates a thiazole tautomerisation
  reaction, but it is not necessary to synthesise HET‐P (Hazra et al., ).
