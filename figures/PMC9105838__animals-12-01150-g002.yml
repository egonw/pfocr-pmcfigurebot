caption: Demonstration of an iteration of the model simulations for the spread of
  Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in a typical Slovenian dairy herd. Susceptible
  cows (Sa); susceptible young (Sy); latent young (Ly); latent cows on low shedding
  pathway (Ll); latent cows on high shedding pathway (Lh); infected cows on low shedding
  pathway (Il); infected cows on high shedding pathway (Ih); high shedders (H).

  of Slovenia Suggests That Different Models Should Be Used to Study Disease Spread
  in Herds of Different Sizes.
