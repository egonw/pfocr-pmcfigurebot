caption: Exploratory analysis by next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry
  of tumor tissues. (A) Genetic profiling of 20 patients. Main clinicopathologic characteristics
  were also listed above the heatmap. (B) Survival analysis by tyrosine-protein kinase
  Lyn (LYN) status. LYNmut, LYN mutated; LYNwt, LYN wild type (C) The survival analysis
  by combined TMB and HR pathway mutation assessment. TMB-H +HRmut, patients with
  TMB-high and HR pathway mutations; TMB-L/HRwt, patients with TMB-low or HR pathway
  wide type. (D) Box plots of neoantigen SNV (left) and neoantigen Del (right) between
  ORR and non-ORR patients. CR, complete response; Del, deletion; HR, homologous repair;
  MSS, microsatellite instability stable; MSI, microsatellite instability; ORR, objective
  response rate; PD, progressive disease; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1; PR, partial
  response; SNF, single nucleotide mutation; SD, stable disease; TMB, tumor mutation
  burden.
