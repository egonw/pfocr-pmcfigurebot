caption: Correlation between intestinal flora and anti‐PD‐1 therapy combined with
  chemotherapy. (A) PCoA analysis of Beta diversity between individuals before and
  after combined therapy based on Bray‐Curtis distance algorithm (PERMANOVA, p = 0.013);
  (B) LEfSe analysis of species differences and marker species(Wilcoxon rank testing,
  p<0.05). Histogram of LDA value distribution of significantly different species,
  showing species significantly enriched in CBR group and NCB group and their significance
  p < 0.05; (C) Metabolic pathway differences between CBR and NCB groups(welch's t‐test,
  all p < 0.05). (D) Logistic regression prediction model was used to analyze the
  predictive ability of three genera with significant differences in fecal intestinal
  microorganisms between CBR group and NCB group. (E) ROC curve analysis of Bifidobacterium,
  Sneathia, and Sutterella for predicting clinical benefit. CBR, clinical benefit
  response, NCB, no‐clinical benefit.
