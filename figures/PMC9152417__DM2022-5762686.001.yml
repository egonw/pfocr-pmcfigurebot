caption: 'Characterization of MDA-MB-231-derived EVs. (a) Expression of exosomal markers
  in MDA-MB-231-derived EVs was assessed by western blot analysis. “Cells” mean total
  cellular protein, and “EVs” present small extracellular vesicles. The exosomal fractions
  are enriched in tetraspanins (CD63 and CD81) and endosomal markers (Alix and TSG101),
  but do not contain Golgi (GM130) or mitochondrial (cytochrome C) markers. Actin
  served as a loading control. (b) TEM was used to observe the morphology of MDA-MB-231-derived
  EVs at 80,000 × magnification and 120,000 × magnification, showing homogenous, cup-shaped
  vesicles at 100 nm. Scale bar represents 200 nm in both panels. (c) Nanoparticle
  tracking analysis was applied to analyze the size of MDA-MB-231 EVs, representing
  as size vs. concentration. TSG101: tumor susceptibility gene 101; TEM: transmission
  electron microscope.'
