figure_title: Angiogenic pathway analysis of hPDLSCs-GRP78 using DAVID and IPA
caption: (a) RNA sequencing data from control hPDLSCs-GRP78 cultured under normal
  conditions (control) and under OD conditions for 2 d. Heatmap and hierarchical clustering
  of genes involved in angiogenesis development and function was generated using the
  bioinformatics program DAVID. The expression levels of genes were indicated by the
  colour bar. Red colour indicates increased expression whereas blue indicates the
  decreased expression as compared to control. (b) The analysed data was then designed
  on a pathway for angiogenesis to analyse the gene network being up or down regulated
  in the pathway using IPA. The brightness of colour is related to the fold change
  of differentially expressed gene and darker the colour the higher the fold change.
