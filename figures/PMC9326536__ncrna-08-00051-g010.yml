caption: Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses of genes co-expressed with THAP9
  in normal vs. tumor samples. The enrichment test was performed for normal vs. tumor
  samples (for each cancer) using the ShinyGO for the top 10 enriched terms, with
  the significance cutoff for adjusted p-values bring set at 0.05. The font sizes
  in the word cloud are proportional to their frequency after the enrichment rates
  were merged for all cancers (left side for normal samples and right side for tumor
  samples). Word clouds of enriched GO terms in (a) the biological process category,
  (b) cellular component category, (c) molecular functions category, and (d) KEGG
  pathways.
