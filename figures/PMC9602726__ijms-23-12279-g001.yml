caption: Effects of GDF11 on PC12 cells. (A) The viability of PC12 cells treated with
  various concentrations of GDF11 or vehicle for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h was measured
  by CCK-8 assay. * p < 0.05. (B) Cell viability was real-time monitored by a real
  time cell analyzer (xCELLigence RTCA TP) for a 120 h-period. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01. (C) Accumulative population doubling times (PDTs) of PC12 cells treated with
  different GDF11 concentrations for a total period of 5 passages. * p < 0.05. (D)
  Protein levels of nestin, βIII-tubulin and GFAP were altered when PC12 cells were
  treated with various concentrations of GDF11 (0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL) for
  72 h. (E) Quantitative analyses of protein expressions of (D) in relation to β-actin
  expression. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001. (F) Transcriptional levels of nestin, βIII-tubulin
  and GFAP when PC12 cells were incubated with or without GDF11 for 5 h. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
