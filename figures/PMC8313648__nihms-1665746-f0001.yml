figure_title: Peroxynitrite Biogenesis and Sensing Mechanism of pnGFP-Ultra
caption: (A) Illustration of the major peroxynitrite (ONOO–) biogenesis pathway. ONOO–
  is generated from the diffusion-controlled reaction between superoxide (O2•–) and
  nitric oxide (•NO). O2•– could be produced during mitochondrial respiration (oxidative
  phosphorylation) or by activated NADPH oxidase (NOX). NOX can be activated during
  cell signaling such as a growth factor binding to a growth factor receptor (GFR).
  Superoxide dismutase (SOD) can convert O2•– to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can
  mediate secondary radical (e.g. •OH or –OCl) production. •NO is produced by nitric
  oxide synthetase (NOS), which is coupled to arginine metabolism. ONOO– is a highly
  reactive nitrogen species that plays crucial roles in tyrosine nitration, lipid
  peroxidation, DNA damage, and cell death.(B) Sensing mechanism of pnGFP-Ultra. pnGFP-Ultra
  has a boronic acid-modified chromophore that can be converted to a phenolate chromophore
  upon reaction with ONOO–, resulting in a large fluorescence turn-on response.(C)
  Cartoon representation of pnGFP1.5-Y.Cro (PDB 5F9G) and key residues targeted during
  pnGFP-Ultra development. Residues identified during directed evolution that increase
  the brightness and folding of cpsGFP are highlighted as cyan sticks. Residues that
  tune of the chemoselectivity of pnGFP-Ultra are highlighted as yellow sticks. The
  chromophore is show in green. The inset box on the right shows the chromophore and
  its interacting residues. The grey sphere denotes a water molecule. The structure
  was prepared using Pymol.
