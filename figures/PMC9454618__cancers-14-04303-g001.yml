caption: KRAS pathway alterations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Catalogue
  of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) MPM datasets. (a) A biological KRAS pathway
  as proposed by Matallanas et al. in 2011 []. Shown are its 13 genes (boxes) interconnected
  via activating (arrows) and inhibitory (dead-end) signaling events, together with
  color-coded alteration types and frequencies (legend). Numbers in boxes denote the
  numbers of TCGA MPM patients (n = 82 with full data) with mutations/fusions/copy
  number alterations for each gene. (b) Clinical and molecular data summary of TCGA
  MPM patients with KRAS pathway genes, color-coded clinical and molecular data plot
  (heatmap), number of patients with no, one, two, or three pathway alterations (table
  insert), and legend. OS, overall survival; GA, genome altered; CNA, copy number
  alteration. Raw data shown as patient numbers (n) and percentages (%) from Hmeljak
  et al., 2018 [], were retrieved from https://www.cbioportal.org/ (accessed on 3
  March 2022) using permanent link https://bit.ly/3BypsnC (accessed on 3 March 2022),
  and were manually analyzed and visualized on Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. KRAS
  pathway mutation frequencies in MPM from COSMIC, stratified by histologic subtype
  (available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/browse/tissue?wgs=off&sn=pleura&ss=all&hn=mesothelioma&sh=&in=t&src=tissue&all_data=n
  (accessed on 3 March 2022); n = 775 patients). Shown are data summary and table,
  presented as mutation numbers (n) and frequencies (%). Note the gradually increasing
  cumulative mutation frequency of the pathway in biphasic and sarcomatoid MPM compared
  with epithelioid MPM. p, probability, 2-way ANOVA.
