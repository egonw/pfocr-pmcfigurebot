number: Supplementary Fig.2. Serum FGF23 in AS mice and Expression of FGFR in aortas
  of AS mice and in FGF23-stimulated HUVECs
figure_title: ''
caption: (A) Levels of serum FGF23 and klotho were detected by the ELISA method. Control
  mice, n=10; AS mice, n=10; (B and C) Protein levels of FGFR1 in aortas of AS mice
  were determined by Western blot analysis. B, representative Western blots. C, results
  were quantified from the pixel values in grayscales. Control mice, n=10; AS mice,
  n=10; (D and E) Protein levels of FGFR1 in FGF23-stimulated HUVECs were determined
  by Western blot analysis. D, representative Western blots. E, results were quantified
  from the pixel values in grayscales (n=3). ＊P＜0.05, ＊＊P＜0.01 vs. control mice or
  vehicle.
