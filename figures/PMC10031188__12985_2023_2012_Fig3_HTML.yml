caption: 'Nonredundant bacterial auxiliary metabolic categories identified in human
  skin virome bacteriophage contigs. Overall metabolic categories showed similar count
  ratios in both the within-sample assembled bacteriophage dataset (B) and the meta-assembled
  bacteriophage dataset (C). Each metabolic category was further broken down by AMG-associated
  KEGG pathways for the meta-assembled dataset (A). Counts are representative of the
  total number of nonredundant AMGs present within each category identified within
  the generated bacteriophage assembly databases and are not a measure of abundance
  within the study population. The persistence and abundance of each metabolic category
  and metabolic pathway are described in Additional file : Figs. S1 and S2'
