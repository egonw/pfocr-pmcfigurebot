caption: PFWE decreased neutrophil infiltration in ARDS model mice. (a) The tissue
  slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) and were observed at
  200× magnification. (b) The quantitative data are shown. The tissue slides were
  photographed by a microscope and quantitated using Image J software. Mice groups
  were divided, as shown in . The data are presented as mean ± SEM (∗p < 0.05 and
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001) compared with the LPS-stimulated group and analyzed using one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Kruskal–Wallis test.
