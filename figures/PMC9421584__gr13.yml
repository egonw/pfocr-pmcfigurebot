caption: FGF15/19 signaling pathway associated protein abundances in patients and
  mice.A–B, Representative Western blots and densitometric quantification of the proteins
  of FGF19, FXR, and FGFR4 in liver tissues from patients with PNAHS and controls.
  C–D, Representative Western blots and densitometric quantification of the proteins
  of FGF15, FXR, and FGFR4 in liver tissues from mice in the chow (14 days), WT-PN
  (14 days), Ppp2ca-LKO-PN (14 days), and Ad-PP2A-PN (14 days) groups. E, Representative
  immunohistochemical images of FGF15 protein distribution in liver from mice in the
  chow (14 days), WT-PN (14 days), Ppp2ca-LKO-PN (14 days), and Ad-PP2A-PN (14 days)
  groups. F, Quantification of liver SAMe concentration in mice liver. The results
  are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (n = 5–7). ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P
  < .001; ∗∗∗∗P < .0001.
