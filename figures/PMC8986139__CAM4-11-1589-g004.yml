caption: High RNASEH1‐AS1 expression is verified in NSCLC. (A) RNASEH1‐AS1 level in
  LUAD and LUSC tissues was analyzed utilizing TCGA. (B) qRT‐PCR was used to determine
  the RNASEH1‐AS1 levels in NSCLC tissues. (C) Kaplan–Meier Plotter was utilized to
  analyze the relationship between RNASEH1‐AS1 level and overall survival in patients
  with LUAD and LUSC. (D)The survival of NSCLC patients in our cohort with high‐ or
  low RNASEH1‐AS1 level. **p<0.01
article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
