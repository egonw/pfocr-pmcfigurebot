caption: 'In an LPS-induced inflammation model, FBL expression is promoted through
  the RAS/MAPK pathway. (A) After the addition of the FBL upstream inhibitor BAY-293
  or SR11302 or the agonist KRA-533 to an HT22 cell model of LPS-induced inflammation,
  cell viability was determined by the CCK-8 assay. n=6; t–test,###p < 0.001; n=6;
  one-way ANOVA, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. (B) HT22 cells were treated with the upstream
  inhibitor BAY-293 or SR11302 or the agonist KRA533 and treated with LPS, followed
  by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. n=3; t–test, ###p < 0.001; n=3; one-way
  ANOVA, *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001. (C) (D) Western blot analysis of LPS-treated
  cells after the addition of an upstream inhibitor. n=3; t–test, ##p < 0.01; n=3;
  one-way ANOVA, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.'
