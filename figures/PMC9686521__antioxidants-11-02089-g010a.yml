caption: Pretreatment with narcissoside (NCS) significantly diminishes reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in 6-OHDA-exposed nematodes by increasing the level of intracellular
  GSH by enhancing the mRNA expression of skin-1, gcs-1, and E01A2.1. L1 stage N2
  nematodes were grown to L3 stage in medium containing NCS. It was then exposed to
  6-OHDA for 1 h. Next, it was transferred to fresh plates containing NCS for an additional
  3 days. (A) Thirty nematodes from each group were randomly selected to detect ROS
  levels in wells of a 96-well plate with the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
  (H2DCFDA) probe. (B) GSH levels were measured in 100 randomly selected nematodes
  from each group using the GSH assay kit. (C) The mRNA expression of skin-1, gcs-1,
  and E01A2.1 in each group of N2 nematodes was quantified by qPCR.
