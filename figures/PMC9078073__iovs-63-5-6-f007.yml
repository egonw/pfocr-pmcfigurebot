caption: 'MLT attenuated autophagy in LPS-stimulated HMGECs. The HMGECs were treated
  with MLT for 48 hours followed by LPS for 24 hours. (A) Images of lysosome in HMGECs
  obtained by LysoTracker staining. Scale bar: 20 µm. (B) Fluorescence intensity quantitation
  of lysosome (n = 3). (C) Images of LC3B-II in HMGECs obtained by immunofluorescence
  staining. Scale bar: 20 µm. (D) Fluorescence intensity quantitation of LC3B-II (n
  = 3). (E) Representative protein bands of Beclin 1 and LC3B-II. (F, G) Quantitative
  intensity of Beclin 1 (F) and LC3B-II (G) (n = 4). *Significantly different from
  control, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ##Significantly different from LPS
  group, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
