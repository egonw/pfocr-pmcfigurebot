caption: (A). Metabolites Sets Enrichment. Over-representation analysis including
  the metabolites most significantly altered by allopurinol is shown. This does not
  account for the direction of the change in the metabolites (increased vs. decreased).
  Bar colors reflect the significance (p value) for the specific pathway. The length
  of each bar indicates fold enrichment of each metabolic pathway. (B). Metabolic
  Pathway Analysis highlights the significant pathways affected by allopurinol compared
  to placebo. We found limited overlap between the pathways affected by allopurinol.
  The matched pathways are shown as circles. The Y-axis represents the âˆ’log of p-values
  from pathway enrichment. The X-axis represents pathway impact value calculated from
  pathway topology analysis. The color and diameter of each circle is based on p-value
  and pathway impact value, respectively.
