caption: 'RNA-seq reveals an inflammatory response in human cortex after SARS-CoV-2
  infection. (A) Primary organotypic cortical cultures from GW21 and GW23 were exposed
  to SARS-CoV-2 for 2 h and processed for RNA-seq 72 h later (three replicates for
  infection and control for each individual). (B) (Left) PC analysis revealed the
  first axis of variation as primarily due to age, while the second was related to
  SARS-CoV-2 infection. PC1 explained 15% of the variance and PC2 10% of the total
  variance. (Middle) Pathway enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology. A set of 22
  genes are upregulated based on FDR < 0.1 and at least a 2-fold increase (100% increase
  or doubling) of normal expression. Upregulated genes in infected samples correspond
  to immune response, inflammation, neutrophil degranulation, and cytokine signaling.
  (Right) Volcano plot of significance versus effect size, with line drawn at FDR
  < 10%. The top downregulated genes are associated with transcription and cell growth
  (blue), and selected upregulated genes associated with inflammation, immune response,
  and microglia activation (red) are labeled. (C) We observe an increase in microglia
  markers TREM2 and CD4 expression after infection. Box plots contain expression values
  for the gene of interest (TREM2: FDR < 0.0094, CD4: FDR < 0.029, blue arrow: microglia
  without TREM2, yellow arrows: microglia with TREM2 or CD4, white arrow: dsRNA+-infected
  cell with TREM2). (D) There is an increase in inflammatory gene expression, including
  CD14 (FDR < 0.0089) and IFITM3 (FDR < 0.057), after infection. Protein staining
  indicates CD14 is increased in IBA1+ microglia (yellow arrow) and infected dsRNA+GFAP+
  astrocytes (white arrow). IFITM3 is increased in infected (yellow arrow) and uninfected
  (white arrow) astrocytes. (E) There is an increase in astrocyte reactivity state
  corresponding to infection-related genes. Cell state enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes from B and SARS-CoV-2 gene expression dose-responsive genes were
  compared with publicly available gene sets of activated microglia () and reactive
  astrocyte () cell states. Gene Ontology plots show an upregulated set of 918 genes
  correlated with SARS-CoV-2 dose based on FDR < 0.1 and at least a 2-fold increase
  of normal expression (GeneOntology up). When evaluating cell state by SARS-CoV-2
  dose, our dataset most highly corresponds to an activated astrocyte population with
  high NF-ÎºB signaling. Pathway enrichment of our viral dose-related dataset indicates
  genes that regulate viral defense, cytokine signaling, and immune response.'
