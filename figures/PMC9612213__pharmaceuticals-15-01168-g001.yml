caption: This figure illustrates the two steps of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling pathway in ischemic stroke, i.e., the priming and activating steps. In
  the first step, the elicitation of PRRs receptors, such as RAGE and TLRs, by endogenous
  cytokines and other ligands induces the activation of nuclear transcription factors,
  such as MAPK and NF-ÎºB, and subsequent upregulation of NLPR3 levels and precursors
  of inflammatory cytokines. Following the priming step, an adaptor protein called
  ASC is assembled to the NLRP3, generating NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Its activation
  is favoured by the efflux of K+, the mobilization of Ca2+, lysosomal rupture, and
  mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by the formation of mtROS and mtDNA.
