caption: Baseline MEK/ERK pathway activity and PHLDA1, DUSP4, EPHA2, and SPRY4 expression
  levels in ovarian cancer cell lines. (A) Immunoblotting analysis of phosphorylation
  of MEK/ERK pathway components in 20 human ovarian cancer cell lines. The image represents
  data obtained from several separate membranes. An A2780 sample was used in each
  membrane as a reference sample. Numbers under the bands represent relative intensity
  normalized to GAPDH levels and the A2780 sample. (B) Cluster analysis of associations
  between baseline expression levels of MEK/ERK responder genes and levels of phosphorylated
  proteins involved in MEK/ERK pathway. Seventeen cell lines displaying consistent
  activity of several MEK/ERK pathway elements were analyzed. Gene expression levels
  estimated via RT-qPCR and protein levels estimated via immunoblotting were subjected
  to Z-score transformation. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using
  1-minus Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation metrics.
