caption: The over-expression of SNHG1 induced stem-cell-like sphere formation and
  invasion; conversely, the knockdown of SNHG1 inhibited sphere formation and invasion.
  (A,B) T24T cells stably transfected with a mock vector (T24T(Vector)) or SNHG1 (T24T(SNHG1))
  were plated into ultra-low attachment plates. After 7 days of culture, representative
  images of sphere colonies were photographed (A), and the number of tumor spheres
  was counted and presented relative to T24T(Vector) cells (B). (C,D) The migration
  and invasion of T24T(Vector) and T24T(SNHG1) cells were both determined using a
  BD BiocoatTM MatrigelTM invasion chamber. Migration was determined using the empty
  insert membrane without Matrigel, while invasion was evaluated using the same system
  except that Matrigel was applied (C). The invasiveness was normalized to the insert
  control according to the manufacturer’s instructions (B). (E) T24T cells were stably
  transfected with a mock vector (T24T(Vector)) or two independent shRNAs of SNHG1,
  i.e., T24T(shSNHG1#1) or shSNHG1#2. The knockdown of SNHG1 is indicated with an
  asterisk (*) indicating significant decreases in comparison to T24T(Vector) cells
  (p < 0.01). (F,G) The stable transfectants were assessed for their migration and
  invasion with the same methods as with SNHG1 over-expression. (H,I) T24T(Vector),
  T24T(shSNHG1#1), and T24T(shSNHG1#2) cells were plated into ultra-low attachment
  plates. After 7 days of culture, representative images of sphere-forming colonies
  were captured under microscopy (H), and the number of spheres formed was counted
  and presented relative to T24T(Vector) cells (B). Bars in (A,H) are equal to 200
  μM and equal to 100 μm in (C,F).
