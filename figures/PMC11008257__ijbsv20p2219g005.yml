caption: NUP85 interacts with CCR2 in AML-12 cells. A. The result of STRING database.
  B. CO-IP results showed that NUP85 combined with CCR2. C. Immunofluorescence staining
  bespeak the colocalization of NUP85 and CCR2. D. immunofluorescence analysis of
  CCR2. E-G. Western blotting, RT-qPCR and Immunofluorescence results of the expression
  levels of NUP85 and CCR2 in cells after transfected with NUP85-siRNA. Measurement
  metrics are shown in the figure. All experimental results of this study were replicated
  at least three times. * *p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared with the pair group.
