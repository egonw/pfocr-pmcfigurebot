caption: Knockdown of INHBB inhibited decidualization of HESCs. a–c HESCs were transfected
  with si-INHBB or si-CTL for 48 h and then treated with 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP and 1 μM
  MPA for decidualization stimulus. The expression of INHBB (a), PRL (b) and IGFBP1
  (c) were measured by qPCR, respectively. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (n = 3,
  one-way ANOVA). si-INHBB-1, -2, and -3, different target sites of the si-RNA. d
  Immunofluorescence analyses of F-actin were visualised using the green-fluorescent
  Alexa Fluor® 488 phalloidin at 48 h of in vitro decidualization after treatment
  with vehicle or si-INHBB-1 in HESCs. The upper panel (magnification 10 × , scale
  bar = 500 μm) is the bright field; the lower panel is the fluorescent and merged
  view of HESCs (magnification 400 ×). The experiment was performed in triplicates
  independently
