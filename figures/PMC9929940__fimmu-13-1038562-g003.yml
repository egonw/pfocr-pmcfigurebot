caption: S-protein-specific B and T cell response in murine bone marrow derived B
  cells and splenocytes and Surrogate Viral Neutralization Test (sVNT) on mouse serum
  from female Balb/c mice dosed on day 1 and boosted on day 21. S-protein specific
  IgG and IgM production from bone marrow derived B cells isolated from 2 x 109 and
  3 x 109 treated mice (n = 6) at day 28 post-initial dose following ex-vivo stimulation
  with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. (A) IgM (pg/ml) concentrations in 2 x 109 dose groups
  and 3 x 109 dose groups. (B) IgG (pg/ml) concentrations in 2 x 109 dose groups and
  3 x 109 dose groups. (C) Change in CD69 expression within the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell
  population following the stimulation of ex vivo splenocytes with wild type SARS-CoV-2
  S-protein in the 2 x 109 dose groups and (D) 3 x 109 dose groups compared to DMSO
  (negative) stimulated controls. Data presented as mean ± SEM. Asterisks represent
  significant values (****p ≤ 0.0001; **p ≤ 0.01; *p ≤ 0.05) calculated using one
  way ANOVA on GraphPad Prism v 9.4.0. (E) IFNγ (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) expression within
  the CD3+ CD4+ T cell population in SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stimulated ex vivo splenocytes.
  (F–K) Viral neutralization tests (VNTs) using the cPASS™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing
  Antibody Assay (FDA approved) for detection in various species was used to assess
  inhibition of RBD binding to hACE2 receptor. (F) VNTs using the serum of mice immunized
  with 2 x 109 (n = 4, 8) and (G) 3 x 109 (n = 8) EDVs against SARS-CoV-2 RBD wild-type.
  Subsequent VNTs were conducted using the serum of 3 x 109 EDV immunized mice against
  the Alpha (H), Beta (I), Gamma (J) and Delta (K) variant RBDs (n = 8). Dotted line
  represents sVNT 30% cut-off correlating with a positive PRNT90 for 1:10 dilution
  of sera.
