figure_title: Proximal tubule TβRII deletion disrupts mitochondrial complex I leading
  to oxidative stress and a metabolic rewiring
caption: a Metacore pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in uninjured
  PT clusters showing the top 10 significantly affected pathways in γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl
  compared to Tgfbr2fl/fl. b Immunoblotting of OXPHOS proteins showing a significant
  decrease of complex I (NDUFB8) expression in uninjured renal cortices of γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl
  mice compared to their Tgfbr2fl/fl littermates; n = 5 (Tgfbr2fl/fl) and 5 (γGT-Cre;Tgfbr2fl/fl)
  mice, p = 0.0041. E-cadherin is used as marker of renal parenchyma and loading control.
  The dots represent the number of animals per group. c Cell fractionation followed
  by immunoblotting and quantification of OXPHOS proteins showing a significant decrease
  of complex I (NDUFB8) basal expression in mitochondria of TβRII−/− PT cells (n = 3
  independent experiments, p = 0.0015). d Bioluminescence measurement of NAD + /NADH
  ratios showing a decreased relative ratio in TβRII−/− PT cells (n = 3 independent
  biological replicates, p = 0.0036). e FACS analysis of DCF-positive cells showing
  increased basal ROS production in TβRII−/− PT cells (n = 6 independent experiments,
  p = 0.0006). f NAD+ treatment significantly decreased ROS in TβRII−/− PT cells,
  assessed with DCF and measured by FACS (n = 3 independent biological replicates,
  p = 0.0027). g NAD+ treatment increased ATP production in TβRII−/− PT cells to the
  same level as in TβRIIflox/flox PT cells, measured by a bioluminescence assay (n = 6
  independent biological replicates, baseline p = 0.0001 and NAD+ treatment p = 0.4025).
  h NAD+ treatment decreased lactate production in TβRII−/− PT cells to the level
  of TβRIIflox/flox PT cells, measured by a bioluminescence assay (n = 3 independent
  biological replicates, baseline p = 0.0057 and NAD+ treatment p = 0.3175). Data
  are presented as mean values ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired
  Student’s t test (two groups) or two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ****p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source data file.
