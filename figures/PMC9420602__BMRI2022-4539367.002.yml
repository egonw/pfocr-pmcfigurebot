caption: (a)â€“(d) The increased expression of Flagella-related genes by qRT-PCR under
  the exposure of different antibiotics in C. jejuni NCTC11168 (S & R) strains. (a)
  shows the increased expression of flagella-related genes under the exposure of macrolide
  antibiotics; (b) shows the increased expression of flagellar-related genes under
  the exposure of aminoglycoside antibiotics; (c) shows the increased expression of
  flagella-related genes under the exposure of quinolone antibiotics, and (d) shows
  the increased expression of flagella-related genes under the exposure of tetracycline
  antibiotics in C. jejuni NCTC11168 (S & R) strains.
