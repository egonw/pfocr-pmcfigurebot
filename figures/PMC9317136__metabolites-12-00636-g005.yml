caption: Dose-dependence of taurine-induced TXNIP promoter activity (+200/+218). Caco-2
  cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing the partial promoter region
  of TXNIP (+200/+218) and then replaced with a medium containing 0–200 mM of taurine.
  After 24 h, the cells were subjected to luciferase assay. The results are expressed
  as relative values, with a control value of 1. Each value represents the mean ±
  S.E. (n = 3), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, vs. the control value (Dunnett’s test).
