caption: RNA-seq analysis reveals activation of the p53 transcriptional program during
  senescence in human islets. A) Overview of human islet DNA damage-induced senescence
  model. Islets isolated from a 44-year-old female donor (Donor 1) or from a 50-year-old
  female donor (Donor 2) were rested overnight and then divided into a total of 6
  wells and cultured in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or 50 μM bleomycin for 48 h
  (n = 3 biological replicates per group). The islets were then transferred to fresh
  drug-free media and cultured an additional 4 days prior to harvesting for RNA extraction
  and paired-end RNA-seq. B) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes (fold-change
  cut-off and FDR <0.05) found indicating 1320 genes downregulated <0.5-fold and 142
  genes upregulated >2-fold in bleomycin treated islets compared to controls from
  Donor 1 and 1139 genes downregulated and 480 genes upregulated from Donor 2. 645
  genes were downregulated in common and 44 genes were upregulated in common in bleomycin-treated
  islets from both donors. C) Significant KEGG pathway terms of common differentially
  expressed genes from Donor 1 and Donor 2. D) Plot of normalized expression levels
  (FPKM) of selected significantly downregulated proliferation and cell cycle genes
  from Donor 1 and Donor 2. E) Plot of normalized expression levels of selected significantly
  upregulated p53 target genes and early senescence gene LMNB1 from Donor 1 and Donor
  2. F) Plot of normalized expression levels of selected islet hormone genes, islet
  cell identity and hormone processing genes from Donor 1 (black and red bars) and
  Donor 2 (grey and blue bars). Only genes with an asterisk were found to be significantly
  different in expression. G) Plot of normalized expression levels of BCL-2 family
  anti-apoptotic genes from Donor 1 and Donor 2. H) Plot of normalized expression
  of selected significantly downregulated/unchanged SASP genes (Down/No change), SASP
  genes that were significantly upregulated in both Donors (Up in both), and SASP
  genes significantly upregulated only in Donor 2 but not Donor 1 (Up in Donor 2).
  Unsupervised hierarchal clustering heatmap of SASP gene normalized expression values
  (FPKM). Legend shows Row Z-score values. V1, V2, V3 and B1, B2, B3 were Vehicle-treated
  or Bleomycin-treated biological replicates from Donor 1. V4, V5, V6 and B4, B5,
  B6 are Vehicle-treated or Bleomcyin-treated biological replicates from Donor 2.
  For all barchart plots, data shown are mean ± SD of the n = 3 biological replicates
  in the RNA-seq datasets per sample group for each donor.
