caption: 'Neuroblastoma-derived sEVs suppress dinutuximab-induced NK cell tumor infiltration
  and enhance the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. (A) Top 20 biological
  processes identified by GO enrichment analysis of 9464D-GD2 tumors treated with
  the combination of dinutuximab and sEVs compared with tumors treated with dinutuximab
  alone, as described in . (B, C) Select GSEA enrichment plots of clusters enriched
  in tumors treated with dinutuximab plus sEVs: (B) negative regulation of lymphocyte
  activation and (C) myeloid leukocyte mediated immunity. (D) GSEA enrichment plot
  for the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. (E, F) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated
  with 9464D-GD2 cells and treated as described in . (E) Quantification and representative
  flow cytometry plots of tumor-infiltrating NK cells (NK1.1+CD3-; top panel) and
  TAMs (CD11b+F4/80+; bottom panel) in 9464D-GD2 tumors isolated from mice in indicated
  treatment groups on day 30. Mean±SEM, n=7 per group. Student’s t-test. *p<0.05;
  **p<0.01; ***p<0.001. (F) Quantification and representative flow cytometry plots
  of NK cells (NK1.1+CD3-) isolated from the blood of tumor-bearing mice on day 30
  in indicated treatment groups. Mean±SEM, n=7 per group. Student’s t-test. *p<0.05;
  **p<0.01; ***p<0.001. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; sEV, small extracellular
  vesicle; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage.'
