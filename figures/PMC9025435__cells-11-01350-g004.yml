caption: Model of proposed gut-brain interactions underlying soy effects in Fmr1KO
  mice. SIF could contribute to increased weight gain through a pathway involving
  APP metabolism, leptin, and NEP. It has been hypothesized that amyloidogenic processing
  of APP in peripheral tissues plays a key role in the response to nutrient excess
  and that this could contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases []. Aβ,
  which is generated by β-secretase 1 (Bace1) and γ-secretase processing of APP, can
  affect numerous metabolic processes [,]. APP and Aβ levels are dysregulated in mouse
  and human models of FXS [,], a disorder comorbid with increased BMI [] and where
  more severe phenotypes are associated with consumption of single-source soy-based
  diets [,,]. It is known that soy phytoestrogens increase APP synthesis in primary
  cultured mouse neuronal cells [], which would provide more template for Bace-1 processing,
  but the mechanism(s) mediating the effects of dietary soy are not known []. Leptin
  and NEP were identified as plasma-based biomarkers responsive to SIF. These biomarkers
  are linked with APP processing [], obesity [,,], and each other []. Aβ can migrate
  from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the brain and cause cognitive impairment,
  but soy flavonoids have a protective effect []. Leptin attenuates the detrimental
  effects of Aβ on spatial memory in rats []; herein, SIF increased leptin levels
  and improved 6-hr recall in the passive avoidance test in WT mice. Soy-based diets
  negatively impact seizure and autism outcomes in mouse and human models [,,,,] consistent
  with the increased need for classroom support and help needed in school. In total,
  these data support a model of overlapping feedback loops with U-shaped response
  curves, involving APP processing, leptin, and neprilysin that underlies diet-induced
  metabolic and neurological outcomes in response to consumption of single-source
  soy-based diets.
