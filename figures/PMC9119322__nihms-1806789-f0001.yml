caption: Hypothetical scheme representing multiple mechanisms of CTIP2-mediated transcriptional
  repression. The top panel shows three potential mechanisms of action of CTIP2 as
  a transcriptional repressor. ‘A’ signifies binding of the CTIP2 to an auxiliary
  DNA-binding domain inhibiting the recruitment of activator and subsequent transcriptional
  complex formation connected to open chromatin structure. ‘B’ represents direct binding
  of the CTIP2 to a GC-rich promoter, thereby blocking the accessibility of the RNA
  polymerase II to the target gene promoter bringing repression to effect. ‘C’ illustrates
  an alternative pathway of CTIP2 binding to a response element on the DNA and disrupting
  the formation of open chromatin complex formation typically encompassing activator,
  mediator, and RNA polymerase II. The bottom panel shows unrestricted transcriptional
  progression in the absence of CTIP2 by enabling formation of open chromatin structure
  and recruitment of transcriptional complex on the target gene promoters to facilitate
  transcription.
