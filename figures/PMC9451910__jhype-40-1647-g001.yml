caption: Schematic representation of the pro-photo-carcinogenic effects of hydrochlorothiazide
  proposed. Data from []. The chronic, combined treatment with UVA and HCTZ, but not
  with HCTZ alone, induces dysplastic changes in human keratinocytes characterized
  by increased DNA damage and inflammation, defective DNA repair, the activation of
  the oncogenic pathway Wnt, apoptosis resistance and clonogenic potential []. Inserted
  photomicrographs show hematoxylin–eosin-stained keratinocytes with a round-shaped
  morphology before treatment; after chronic treatment with UVA and HCTZ, a pseudoepithelial
  morphology and dysplastic features are observed (scale bar 50 μmol/l).
article_title: A reverse translational pharmacological approach to understand the
  underlying mechanisms of the reported association between hydrochlorothiazide and
  non-melanoma skin cancer.
