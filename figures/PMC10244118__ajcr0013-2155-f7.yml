caption: Inhibition of miR-509-5p by Ly6D is essential for β-catenin-drove chemoresistance
  of LSCC cells. (A) Graphic representation of construction of luciferase reporter
  gene with conserved miR-509-5p binding motif in 3’UTR of wild-type or mutant CTNNB1.
  (B) Luciferase reporter activity in 293T cells cotransfected with wild-type or mutant
  CTNNB1 3’UTR with mimics for miR-509-5p. (C) Tu686 cells with Ly6D silencing were
  transfected with NC inhibitor and miR-509-5p inhibitor for 48 h, and the indicated
  mRNA expressions were analyzed by qPCR assay. (D) Tu686 cells with Ly6D silencing
  were transfected with NC inhibitor and miR-509-5p inhibitor for 48 h in the presence
  of various concentrations of cisplatin, and then cell viability was analyzed by
  CCK8 assay. (E, F) CCK8 assay (E) and clonogenic assay (F) were conducted to analyze
  Tu686 cells with Ly6D overexpression were transfected with miR-cont and miR-509-5p
  mimics for 48 h in the presence of various concentrations of cisplatin. (G) Tu686
  cells were transfected with miR-cont and miR-509-5p mimic for 48 h, the expression
  of MDM2 and FOXM1 was detected using western blot.
