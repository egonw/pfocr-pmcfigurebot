caption: (A) Transcript of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, snail, wnt, β-catenin,
  and c-Myc after Rh4 treatment (10 and 20 µM). (B) Immunohistochemical images of
  E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and snail. In lymph nodes and lungs. Scale bar
  = 100 µm. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Rh4 promoted E-cadherin in
  lymph nodes and lungs and inhibited the expression of N-cadherin. Scale bar = 10
  µm. All data are presented as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** and p < 0.001.
