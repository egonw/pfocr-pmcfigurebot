caption: TSD exerts anti-inflammatory effects on HUVECs via inhibition of the NOD-like
  receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)/Caspase-1/interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) signaling pathway.
  (A,B) Representative western blots (A) and quantification (B) of the protein expression
  of NLRP3, Casapase-1, and IL-1β after treatment with TSD. Cells in 6-well plates
  were treated with or without TSD (0, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μM) for 18 h, and TNFα (10
  ng/mL) was added for 6 h. Western blot was performed to assess NLRP3, Casapase-1,
  and IL-1β protein levels. (C,D) Representative western blots (C) and quantification
  (D) of the protein expression of NLRP3, Casapase-1, and IL-1β after treatment with
  siControl and siKLF2. HUVECs were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with
  siControl or siKLF2 with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for 6 h. Then, the medium was replaced
  with endothelial cell medium and incubated for another 18 h. Then, the cells were
  treated with or without TSD (10 μM) for 18 h, followed by 10 ng/mL of TNFα for 6
  h. Western blot was performed to assess NLRP3, Casapase-1, and IL-1β protein levels.
  Each group was represented by a representative image. Values are represented as
  the mean ± SEM; n = 3; one-way ANOVA was used for analysis. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001,
  *** p < 0.0001.
