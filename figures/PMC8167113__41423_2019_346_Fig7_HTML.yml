figure_title: Microgravity activates the p53 signaling pathway
caption: 'a Heatmap showing the expression levels of genes from the p53 signaling
  pathway. Red gene symbols represent shared upregulated genes. Black gene symbols
  represent genes that were uniquely downregulated by spaceflight or simulated microgravity.
  Blue gene symbols represent shared downregulated genes. b Microgravity-activated
  p53 pathway model. Enzymes, substrates, and products are shown as modules, and activated
  reactions are shown as arrows. Gene expression profiles of all genes in this pathway
  are represented by up and down arrows. Blue arrows represent changes in spaceflight
  samples, and purple arrows indicate changes in simulated microgravity samples. c
  Validation of notable genes in the p53 signaling pathway, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
  Control: macrophages after in vitro differentiation under normal gravity. d Western
  blot validation of key proteins in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways
  regulated by p53 signaling.'
