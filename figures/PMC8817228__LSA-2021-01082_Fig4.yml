figure_title: The TORC2 signalling pathway control Pub1 via Gsk3. Pub1 levels are
  reduced in mutants of Gsk3
caption: (A) Protein extracts were prepared from indicated yeast strains and immunoblotted
  for Pub1, Ponceau S is used to stain total protein. Bars indicate fold change in
  levels versus indicated control ± SEM, n = 3. n represents biologically independent
  experiments. Representative immunoblot is shown. (B) Growth characteristics of indicated
  strains on EMM2 and EMM2 + 6 μg/ml canavanine. For all growth assays, similar results
  were obtained for three independent biological repeats. (C, D, E, F) Protein extracts
  were prepared from indicated yeast strains and immunoblotted for Pub1, Ponceau S
  is used to stain total protein. Bars indicate fold change in levels versus indicated
  control ± SEM, n = 3. n represents biologically independent experiments. Representative
  immunoblots are shown.

  pombe is regulated by TORC2 and Gsk3.
