caption: 'MiR-411 Modulates Hippo Pathway in Cardiomyocytes(A) Screen analysis using
  luciferase reporter constructs in H9c2 cardiac myoblast cell line revealed that
  miR-411 expression increased the activity of the YAP, but not Wnt, STAT3, nuclear
  factor kappa B (NFκB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), or AP-1, signaling
  pathways (n = 12 in each group). (B) Confirmatory analysis using primary cardiomyocytes
  indicated that YAP activity was significantly enhanced in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
  (NRCMs) after miR-411 transfection (n = 4 independent experiments with a minimum
  of 3 technical replications in each experiment). (C to F) Analysis of YAP-target
  gene expression, including (C) Pik3cb, (D) Birc5, (E) Fgf2, and (F) Tead1 in NRCM
  following transfection with miR-411 or control (n = 5 or 6 independent experiments
  in each group). (G, H) Analysis of YAP-target gene expression in mouse heart tissues
  following direct injection with miR-411. (G) Expression of Ctgf was significantly
  increased at injection sites; however, (H) no YAP-target genes examined exhibited
  elevated expression at distant sites. Statistical tests used: (A) multiple unpaired
  Student''s t-test, (B to F) Student’s t-test, and (G, H) multiple unpaired Student''s
  t-test. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
