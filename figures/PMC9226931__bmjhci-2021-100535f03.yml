caption: Longitudinal pathway plot of a hypothetical patient with rectal cancer treated
  with neoadjuvant therapy then radical resection. After a colonoscopy and around
  the time of diagnosis the patient had neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy
  as identified by the green and blue circles. They then proceeded to surgery, after
  which TNM staging was available (small pink circles). The next time point for this
  patient (light grey line) shows a scan done as part of the follow-up regime, with
  several further thereafter. Nearly 300 days since diagnosis a scan and colonoscopy
  led to the diagnosis of recurrence and further radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The
  final ‘X’ signifies death, although it does not show whether death was related to
  the cancer or not. TNM, tumour, node, metastases.
