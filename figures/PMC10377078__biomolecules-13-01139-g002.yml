caption: Function of S100A6 in colorectal cancer. (A) β-catenin and TCF-Lef1 co-transfection
  activated the promoter of S100A6, promoting the increase in S100A6 expression. S100A6
  interacted with lamin A/C to promote the progression of colorectal cancer. (B) S100A6
  can also promote the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells by activating
  p38MAPK and ERK-signaling pathway.
