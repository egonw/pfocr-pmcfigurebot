caption: 'Upregulation of IGF2BP2 reverses the regulatory effect of knockdown of NT5DC2
  on the proliferation and apoptosis of diffuse large B-cell carcinoma cells. (A)
  Viability of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2 and Oe-IGF2BP2 was analyzed
  by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) Proliferation of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with
  shRNA-NT5DC2 and Oe-IGF2BP2 was observed by BrdU staining. (C) Cell cycle analysis
  and (D) apoptosis of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2 and Oe-IGF2BP2
  was detected by flow cytometry. (E) Expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins
  were analyzed by western blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NT5DC2 + Oe-NC. IGF2BP2, insulin-like
  growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2; NT5DC2, 5′-nucleotidase domain-containing
  2; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; oe, overexpression; BrdU, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine; NC,
  negative control; cyto-c, cytochrome c; PARP, poly-ADP ribose polymerase; OD, optical
  density.'
article_title: Decreased RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 downregulates NT5DC2, which suppresses
  cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the p53 signaling pathway.
