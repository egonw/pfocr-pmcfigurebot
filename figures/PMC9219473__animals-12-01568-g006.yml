caption: Iturin A rescued STb-R-induced pork skeletal muscle growth restriction through
  hypothalamic-pituitary-mTORC1 growth axis. In detail, the engineered STb-Rosetta
  Escherichia coli (STb-R) inhibited IGF-1 expression in muscle via the hypothalamic-pituitary
  growth axis, and the downstream mTORC1 signaling pathway responded to change in
  IGF-1, ultimately limiting skeletal muscle growth in piglets. Iturin A reactivated
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-mTORC1 growth axis, which promoted skeletal muscle growth
  and alleviated STb-R restriction in piglets.
