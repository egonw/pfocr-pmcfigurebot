caption: miR‐20a targets PTEN to induce chemoresistance and progression in non‐small‐cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Following miR‐20a mimic transfection and PTEN overexpression
  (OE‐PTEN) or NC plasmid transfection, cells were analyzed via (A) Western blotting
  demonstrating that miR‐20a regulates PTEN expression. (B) CCK‐8 assessment was implemented
  to analyse cell viability. (C) CCK‐8 assessment was implemented to appraise DDP
  IC50 values for HCC827 and H1299 cells. (D) Cellular proliferation following miR‐20a
  mimic transfection and/or PTEN overexpression was assessed via EdU uptake assay.
  (E) A colony formation assessment was employed to appraise H1299 and HCC827 cell
  proliferation. Results are representative data from triplicate experiments, and
  outcomes are means ± standard deviation (SD) (**,##p < .01; ***p < .001)

  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
