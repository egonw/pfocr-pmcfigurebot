caption: A web browsing interface for the interactome between human cancer genes and
  twelve edible seaweed genomes. (A) The homepage includes the data search interface,
  and the data download links. (B) The search result will guide the user to each cancer-related
  gene page. (C) On each gene page, we provide basic annotation information, such
  as gene ontology and KEGG pathway of the cancer genes.
