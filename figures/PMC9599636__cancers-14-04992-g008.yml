caption: Bioinformatic analysis of two PYCARD subgroups in the KIRC cohort. (A) The
  DEGs between the high-PYCARD group and the low-PYCARD group are presented in the
  volcano plot. (B) The proportions of immune cells using the CIBERSORT method. (C)
  Difference of immune cell proportions between PYCARD subgroups. (D) Difference of
  single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) in immune cell proportions between PYCARD subgroups.
  (E) Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between PYCARD subgroups. (F)
  GSEA analysis of DEGs between PYCARD subgroups (G) Expressions of ICP genes varied
  in PYCARD subgroups (*** p < 0.001). (DEG, differentially expressed genes; GO, gene
  ontology; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; ICP, immune checkpoint).
