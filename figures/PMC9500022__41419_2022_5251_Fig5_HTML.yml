figure_title: Effect of conditioned medium from drug-resistant ccRCC cells on endothelial
  cells activity
caption: A The levels of secreted IL6 and IL8 in conditioned media from resistant
  Caki cells, measured by ELISA. B Representative western blot of MMP9 in Caki-1 cells
  after 7 days treatment with drugs with β-actin as a loading control. C Representative
  merged images after immunofluorescence staining of HUVEC cells after 8 or 16 h of
  treatment with conditioned media from Caki-2 cells, treated 7 days with sunitinib
  or sorafenib. Dotted lines show borders of monolayer disruption. D Representative
  Western Blot of HUVEC cells, after 3 h stimulation with conditioned media from Caki-1
  or Caki-2 cell lines, treated 7 days with drugs. β-actin was used as a loading controls.
  E Schematic representation of sunitinib and sorafenib resistance. Sunitinib-resistant
  cells secrete high amounts of IL8 and IL6 which activates a signaling pathway from
  VEGFR2 through SRC, which leads to VE-cadherin internalization, loss of cell-cell
  contact and increased motility. Sorafenib-resistant RCC cells secrete high amount
  of MMP9, which cleaves VE-cadherin and leads to disruption of ECs monolayer integrity.
