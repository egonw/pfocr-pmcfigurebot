figure_title: KSHV latent-2 cells are a unique viral population with a distinct gene
  expression profile
caption: (A) Heatmap of viral gene expression in KSHV cells (3 and 6 dpi combined).
  Latent cells are GFP+. Latent-2 cells are GFP+/PAN- with gene expression from the
  K2 to K5 area of the genome. Lytic cells are GFP+/PAN+ cells. (B) Heatmap showing
  all significantly expressed genes in latent, latent-2, and lytic cells. Expression
  is shown as log2 fold change comparing latent, latent-2, and lytic cells to the
  bystander cells. (C) Heatmap showing pathway activation z-scores of the KSHV cell
  populations compared to mock cells. (D-F) Violin plots showing gene expression of
  genes involved in the wound healing, ephrin receptor signaling, or NRF2 response
  to oxidative stress. Statistical comparisons are compared to the latent-2 population.
  * indicates p-value ≤ 0.05, ** indicates p-value ≤ 0.01, *** indicates p-value ≤
  0.001. Boxplots in gray within the violin show the first quartile, median, and third
  quartile.
