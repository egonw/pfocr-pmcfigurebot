caption: CB restrained the proliferation of cancer cells and the expression of MyD88
  and NF-κB/p65 in vitro. (A) MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 expression was detected by western
  blot in HT-29 cells and CT26 cells. (B,C) Comparison of the protein expression of
  MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 in HT-29 cells (B) and CT26 cells (C). (D,E) Effects of CB on
  MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 expression in HT-29 cells and CT26 cells were detected by RT-qPCR.
  Error bars represent mean ± SD; **P<0.01. MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor
  88; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; Ctrl, control group; MOI, multiplicity of infection;
  CB, Clostridium butyricum; RT-qPCR, real time quantitative PCR.
article_title: Clostridium butyricum inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer
  and alleviates intestinal inflammation via the myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
