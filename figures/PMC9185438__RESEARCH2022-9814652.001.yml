caption: 'A subset of esophageal squamous cancer cell lines is vulnerable to inhibitors
  of LSD1 and G9a. (a) Heatmap of cell viability measured in the indicated cancer
  cell lines treated with the indicated small-molecule epigenetic modifiers (applied
  at 5 μM each). (b) Heatmap of cell viability measured for the indicated cell lines
  treated with the indicated concentrations of SP2509 and BIX01294. (c) Model depicting
  the proposed actions of SP2509 and BIX01294 by inhibiting LSD1 and G9a, respectively.
  FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide; SAM: S-adenosyl-L-methionine; SAH: S-adenosyl
  homocysteine; Me: mono-methylation; Me2: di-methylation. (d) Summary of the viability
  of the indicated ESCC lines treated with the indicated concentrations of SP2509
  (SP) and BIX01294 (BIX). CI50: combination index at median effect of drug treatment.
  CI50 < 1 indicates synergism. (e) Colony formation assay of Kyse510 ESCCs treated
  with vehicle or increasing concentrations of SP2509 and/or BIX01294. (f) Time course
  of cell growth of Kyse510 ESCC cells treated with 4 μM SP2509 and/or 1.8 μM UNC0642
  for the indicated number of days. (g, h) Same as (d) and (e), respectively, except
  the cells were treated with SP2509 and UNC0642 (UNC). (i) ESCC cells were treated
  with vehicle or 10 μM SP2509 and 10 μM UNC0642 for 0, 1, 2, or 3 days, followed
  by Western blot analysis. (j) Silencing efficiency of Dox-inducible shRNA constructs
  targeting LSD1 and G9a was measured at the mRNA and protein levels in Kyse510 cells
  treated with vehicle or 200 ng/ml Dox for 4 days. (k) Cell viability and colony
  formation were measured in shRNA-expressing Kyse510 cells treated with vehicle or
  200 ng/ml Dox for 6 days and 10 days, respectively. (l, m) Viability of Kyse510
  cells stably expressing the Dox-inducible shLSD1 (l) or shG9a (m); where indicated,
  cells were treated for 3 days with 200 ng/ml Dox and 0.6 μM UNC0642 (l) or 3 μM
  SP2509 (m). ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (unpaired Student''s t-test). The data are
  representative of three independent experiments.'
