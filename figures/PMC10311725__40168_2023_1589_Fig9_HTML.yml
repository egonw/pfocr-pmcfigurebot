caption: 'Ri. treatment improved the perturbation of neurotransmitters from the Trp-Kyn
  metabolic pathway in mouse brains and colons. A Levels of 5-HT and KP metabolites
  in the PFCs of the mice. B Levels of 5-HT and KP metabolites in the colons of the
  mice. C Protein expression of the rate-limiting enzymes of KP metabolism in the
  mice PFCs and colons. D The statistical plots of the PFCs. E The statistical plots
  of the colon. Data were displayed as mean ± SEM. Significant differences were determined
  via two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison procedure. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 vs. the CTR + PBS group; &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&&p < 0.0001
