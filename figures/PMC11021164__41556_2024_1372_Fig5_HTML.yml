figure_title: SAT1 expression in PDAC cells is critical for acetate-mediated growth
  of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
caption: a,b, Relative levels of SAT1 mRNA and protein in control (shScr) and SAT1
  knockdown (shSAT1-a and shSAT1-b) S2-013 (a) and HPAF-II (b) cells under acidosis
  (n = 4 in each group, from independent biological replicates). Images are representative
  of two independent experiments. c,d, Relative survival of shScr and SAT1 knockdown
  S2-013 (c) and HPAF-II (d) cells in the presence and absence of acetate under acidosis
  (n = 3 in each group, from independent biological replicates). e,f, Relative levels
  of polyamine biosynthetic pathway metabolites in shScr and shSAT1 S2-013 (e) and
  HPAF-II (f) cells in the presence and absence of 5 mM acetate under acidosis. Metabolites
  are presented as normalized row Z-scores from n = 6 (S2-013) and n = 4 (HPAF-II)
  biological replicates per group. g,h, Representative images (g) of PA417 and PA901
  organoids cultured alone or in combination with HPS cells upon treatment with 25 µM
  pentamidine, along with mean organoid diameters (h). Scale bars, 100 µm. PA417,
  n = 4 (vehicle), n = 4 (+HPS), n = 6 (pentamidine), n = 4 (HPS + pentamidine), and
  PA901, n = 4 in each group from independent biological replicates. i,j, Tumour weights
  (i) and volumes (j) upon necropsy of mice implanted with control and SAT1 knockdown
  S2-013 cells alone or co-implanted with HPS cells (n = 12 (shScr), n = 12 (shScr + HPS),
  n = 10 (shSAT1), n = 10 (shSAT1 + HPS) mice). k,l, Representative IHC images for
  Ki-67 staining (k) in tumour sections from mice implanted with shScr or shSAT1 S2-013
  cells alone or co-implanted with HPS cells along with the quantitation of percent
  positive cells (l). Scale bars, 100 µm. Ki-67 positive cells were counted in three
  different fields from three tumour sections of each group (n = 9 in each group).
  One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test, mean ± s.e.m. (a,b,h–j,l); two-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test, mean ± s.e.m. (c,d).
