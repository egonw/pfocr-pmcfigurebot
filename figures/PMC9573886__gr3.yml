caption: 'COL-2 and MMP-3 Immunohistochemical staining and percentage comparison of
  condyle cartilage of COL-2 and MMP-3 positive chondrocytes between different groups.
  A: Immunohistochemical staining and the COL-2 and MMP-3 analysis of quantitative
  in the condylar cartilage. B: Corresponding to the microscopic images, COL-2 expression
  was significantly decreased in the overloaded groups. The decrease was most significant
  in the 4wk group. Moreover, compare to the 4wk group, the COL-2 expression was increased
  in the 8wk groups. C: The MMP-3 expression increased to various degrees in the overloaded
  groups, The change in the 4wk group was most significant. Again, compare to the
  4wk group, MMP-3 expression was decreased in the 8wk groups. The data are recorded
  as the mean ± SD. (∗P < 0:05; ∗∗P < 0:01. ∗∗P < 0:001.'
article_title: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the progress of mandibular
