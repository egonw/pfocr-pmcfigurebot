caption: 'QTF alleviates MP infection-induced cytokine release, ROS production, and
  ER stress in A549 cells. (a) The TNF-α and IL-8 release. (b) Western blot assay
  was used to detect the cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB protein levels. (c) Flow cytometry
  was used to measure ROS production. (d) Real-time PCR was used to measure PERK and
  ATF6 mRNA levels. (e) The PERK, eIF2α, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP protein levels were
  measured. (f) TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptotic cells. ×200. (g) Immunofluorescence
  was used to measure caspase 3, CHOP, and PERK levels. ×200. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control;
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. vehicle; +P < 0.05, ++P < 0.01, and
