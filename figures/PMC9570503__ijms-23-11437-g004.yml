caption: 'Modulating effect of WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 on the cell proliferation in prostate
  carcinoma PC-3 cells. Expressions of WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 after the ectopic-overexpressed
  WISP1v1 and WISP1v2 in the PC-3 cells were assessed by RT-PCR (A), ELISA (B), and
  RT-qPCR (C) assays. (D) The expressions of WISP1v1, WISP1v2, NDRG1, and β-actin
  were determined by immunoblot assays (M: 100 bp Marker; 1: PC-DNA; 2: PC-WISP1v1;
  3: PC-WISP1v2). The abilities of the proliferation of PC-DNA, PC-WISP1v1 (E), and
  PC-WISP1v2 (F) cells were measured by EdU flow cytometry assays. Data are presented
  as the mean percentage of the EdU positive cells (±SE; n = 4). ** p < 0.01.'
