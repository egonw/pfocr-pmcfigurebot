caption: 'Alterations in the hepatic cardiolipin biosynthesis in alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis (AC) and alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). A: The mitochondrial cardiolipin
  (CL) synthetic pathway and its correlation with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
  (MELD) score (node color corresponds to Pearson r value) in AH validation cohort.
  B: Expression of 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (PLCB), protein
  tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1 (PTPMT1), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit α (ECHA) across AH severity. C: Liver
  levels of cardiolipin in AC and AH patients. Data are presented as means ± SEM (B
  and C). ∗P < 0.05 was considered significant.'
