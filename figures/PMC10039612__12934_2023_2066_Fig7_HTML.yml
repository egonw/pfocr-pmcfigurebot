caption: Effect of l-Val or l-Leu on the expression of perylenequinone biosynthetic
  genes of S. bambusicola S8. A The proposed perylenequinone biosynthesis pathway.
  Some of steps and compounds are omitted for simplification. B The expression of
  perylenequinone biosynthetic genes by l-Val or l-Leu added at 1.5 g/L on day 2.
  The culture without l-Val and l-Leu in the production medium with Triton X-100 was
  used as control. PKS polyketide synthase, Omef O-methyltransferase, FAD FAD/FMN-dependent
  oxidoreductase, Mono monooxygenase, MCO multicopper oxidase, MFS major facilitator
  superfamily, ABC ATP-binding cassette transporter and ZFTF zinc finger transcription
  factor. Values are mean ± SD from three independent experiments (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01
  versus control group)
