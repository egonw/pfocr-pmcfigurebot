caption: Effects of RSV on ZEA-induced TM4 cytotoxicity. TM4 cells were seeded into
  a 96-well plate, and the viability analysis of TM4 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay.
  (A) Effects of different concentrations of ZEA on TM4 cell viability. TM4 cells
  were treated with increasing concentrations of ZEA (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30
  μmol·L−1) for 24 h. (B) Effects of different concentrations of RSV on TM4 cell viability.
  TM4 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of RSV (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and
  7.5 μmol·L−1) for 24 h. (C) Effects of RSV on ZEA-induced TM4 cell viability. TM4
  cells were exposed to ZEA (20 μmol·L−1) for 24 h after pretreatment with different
  concentrations of RSV for 3 h. Different letters (a, b, c, and d) represent a significant
  difference (p < 0.05 calculated by ANOVA for each group), while the same letters
  indicate no significant difference between groups.
