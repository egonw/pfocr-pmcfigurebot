caption: A schematic model for how WWOXd cells undergo retrograde migration upon facing
  WWOXf cells. (A) The primary structure of WWOX is depicted. (B) When WWOXd cells
  face WWOXf cells, WWOXd cells undergo activation of multiple signaling pathways,
  including MIF, HYAL-2, WNT and EPH-Ephrin, that converge to MEK/ERK pathway leading
  to retrograde migration. WWOXd cells have no physical contacts with WWOXf cells
  but are able to kill WWOXf cells from a distance. (C) TGF-β abolishes the retrograde
  migration and apoptosis, and induces anterograde migration and merger of WWOXd and
  WWOXf cells. Similarly, antibodies against MIF, HYAL-2 or EPH-Ephrin, and WNT inhibitors
  abolish the retrograde migration of WWOXd cells in facing WWOXf cells [,].
