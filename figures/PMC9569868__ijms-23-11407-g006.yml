caption: 'DIM treatment enhances antioxidant ability by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway and reducing oxidative stress in TGF-β1-induced hepatocytes injury. (A)
  Protein expression levels of Nrf2, NQO1, Keap-1, HO-1, Cu/Zn SOD, and hepatic cytochrome
  P450 (CYP2E1) at 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment were determined by Western blot analysis.
  (B) Quantification of proteins expression normalized to β-actin. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SE of three individual experiments (n = 3). #p < 0.05, and ###p < 0.001
  denotes significant differences compared to the control; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  and *** p < 0.001 compared to treatment with TGF-β1 only.'
