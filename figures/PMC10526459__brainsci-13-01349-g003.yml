caption: The biological function of EGFR pathway-related prognostic gene signature.
  (A). There is separation between the high-risk and low-risk groups in the TCGA cohort;
  (B). The 315 overlapped genes positively associated with risk score (R > 0.4, p
  < 0.0001) between the TCGA and CGGA sets; (C). BP analysis indicates that risk score
  is positively related with multiple cytokines pathways; (D,E). GSEA reveals the
  relationship between risk score and IFN-γ response pathway in the TCGA set (D) and
  the CGGA set (E); (F). WB assay demonstrates that long-term exposure to IFN-γ (400
  ng/mL, 7 days) can trigger the activation of EGFR pathway in u87 GBM cell line;
  (G,H). Heatmap of signaling pathway activity scores by PROGENy in the TCGA set (G)
  and the CGGA set (H).
