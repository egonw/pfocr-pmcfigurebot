caption: The fertility was disturbed after exogenous ethylene treatment. (A) Inflorescence
  before ethylene treatment. Note that the start position of inflorescence (flower
  with anthers at stage 13) was marked with a red line so as to observe the elongation
  of siliques after 14 days. (B–E) Inflorescence of Col without ET treatment (B),
  with ethylene (100 µL L−1) treatment for 6 h (C), 12 h (D), and 24 h (E). After
  ET treatment, these plants grew for 14 days under normal conditions. Arrows indicate
  the closed buds or short siliques without seeds. The developmental stage of anthers
  in each bud before ethylene treatment is marked next to the corresponding siliques
  or flower buds. Bars = 2 cm in B–E. (F) Col flower. Bar = 1.0 mm. (G,H) Col flower
  after ethylene (100 µL L−1) treatment for 12 h (G) and 24 h (H). Note that filaments
  are shortened after 12 h or 24 h ethylene treatment, and the development of the
  anther of stage 8 is abnormal after 24 h ethylene treatment. Bars = 1.0 mm in (G,H).
