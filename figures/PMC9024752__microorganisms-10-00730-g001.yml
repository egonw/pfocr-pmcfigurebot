caption: Scheme of the metabolic pathway for DPA biosynthesis in engineered C. glutamicum
  Dpa1 (A) and of the reactions at the branchpoint intermediate HTPA (B). Single catalytic
  steps are depicted by solid lines and multiple catalytic steps by dashed lines.
  It includes endogenous genes (blue) and heterologous dipicolinate synthase genes
  dpaAB from P. sonchi SBR5 (green). Variants of endogenous genes (purple), namely
  feedback-resistant aspartokinase lysCT311I, pyruvate carboxylase pycP458S and homoserine
  dehydrogenase homV59A, increase L-aspartate conversion and anaplerosis via pyruvate
  carboxylase, while decreasing drain of aspartate-4-semialdehyde towards threonine
  and methionine biosynthesis. DPA shares the first three steps of L-lysine biosynthesis
  via aspartokinase (lysC), aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) and HTPA synthase
  (dapA). A red cross indicates the deletion of carboxykinase gene ppc (red) to prevent
  decarboxylation of oxaloacetate. Glucose uptake is PTS (phosphotransferase system)
  mediated and L-lysine is exported via LysE. Brackets depict putative spontaneous
  dehydration of HTPA.
