caption: Gene expression profiles of the retina samples. (A–D) Volcano plot showing
  the differentially expressed genes in the PBS- and GCSF-treated groups. (A) The
  PBS-treated group (day 3 post rAION) vs. the sham-operated group. (B) The PBS-treated
  group (day 7 post rAION) vs. the sham-operated group. (C) The GCSF-treated group
  (day 3 post rAION) vs. the sham-operated group. (D) The GCSF-treated group (day
  7 post rAION) vs. the sham-operated group. For each plot, the X-axis represents
  log2 FC, and the Y-axis represents −log10 (p-values). The differentially expressed
  genes are shown as red dots. (E) The heatmap of the hierarchical clustering of the
  differentially expressed genes. Up- and downregulated genes are represented in red
  and green colors, respectively. The differentially expressed genes were defined
  as having absolute FC > 1.5 and FDR < 0.1.
