caption: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)/TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-mediated inflammatory
  response and cell death pathways. The binding of TNF-α to TNFR1 triggers inflammatory
  responses, apoptosis and necroptosis. Ubiquitination of receptor interacting protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1) promotes cell survival and induces an inflammatory response by
  activating the NF-κB, p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK signalling pathways. If caspase-8 is
  present in cells, deubiquitination of RIPK1 results in the formation of either complex
  IIa or complex IIb, leading to RIPK1-independent apoptosis (RIA) or RIPK1-dependent
  apoptosis (RDA), respectively. If caspase-8 is absent, necroptosis is initiated,
  in which RIPk1, receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage
  kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein play a key role.
