caption: Heatplots of the Reactome enriched pathways for the (A) COAD, (B) STAD, (C)
  BLCA, (D)BRCA and (E)CESC projects. The plots were generated using the sub-network
  nodes resulting from the COMBO querying step. The enriched pathways are listed on
  the vertical axis. The gene symbols contributing to the pathway are reported in
  the horizontal axis. The gene logFC computed between GAIN-Chr20 and Solid Normal
  Tissue is represented using blue and red for the lowest and highest gene expression,
  respectively. A logFC range between 2 and -2 was setted to reduce the color scale.
  Gray indicates genes with logFC = 0. (F) Venn Diagram with common enriched pathways
  for the analyzed TCGA projects.
