caption: (A) Overview of the phenotypes under investigation. Early bleeding occurs
  up and until the 20th gestational week, antepartum between the 20th gestational
  week and birth, and postpartum hemorrhage after birth. (B) Manhattan plot of postpartum
  hemorrhage showing the 18M variants, with SNPs passing the functionally informed
  multiple testing criteria highlighted in green. (C) Miami plot comparing postpartum
  hemorrhage due to atony (top) and retained placenta (bottom). Green dots indicate
  SNPs passing the multiple testing threshold.
