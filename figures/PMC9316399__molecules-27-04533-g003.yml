caption: Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins of MO
  treatment compared to control treatment using Metascape. (A,C) Network of enriched
  pathways of downregulated (A) and upregulated (C) proteins of MO treatment compared
  to control. Each node and its size represent a statistically enriched pathway and
  the number of enriched proteins on each node pathway, respectively. The clusters
  of similar pathways are labeled with the same color. (B,D) Bar charts plot the cluster
  significance of enriched pathways of downregulated (B) and upregulated (D) proteins
  in MO treatment. Each bar showed top one of each enriched cluster pathways. Annotations
  refer to the gene ontology biological processes (GOBP), Reactome, KEGG, canonical
  pathways, and WikiPathways. The top pathways ranked by their significance (−log10 p-value)
  are shown. The detail information for enriched pathways was listed in .
