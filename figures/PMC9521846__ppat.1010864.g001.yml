figure_title: Toxoplasma gondii encodes its pentose phosphate pathway within 2 subcellular
  locations
caption: (A), Schematic representation of the pentose phosphate pathway in Toxoplasma
  parasites. (B), Gene ID of the PPP genes. (C), Representative images of immunofluorescence
  assay. Different enzymes of PPP tagged at the C terminus with smHA epitope by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
  homologous recombination in the RHΔku80 strain. Subsequently, the parasites of testing
  strains were fixed, permeabilized and stained with mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-TgALD,
  which were detected by Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies,
  respectively. TgALD and Hoechst were used as the cytoplasm and cell nucleus markers,
  respectively. Bar = 5 μm.
