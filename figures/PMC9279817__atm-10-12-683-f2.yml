caption: 'Overexpression of miR-20a activates osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation.
  After transfecting the cells with miR-20a double-stranded miRNA mimics (50 or 100
  nM), miRNA NC (50 or 100 nM), or transfection reagent only (control) for 12 h, the
  cultures of confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were placed in α-MEM medium with β-glycerophosphate
  (10 mM) and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid. (A) qRT-PCR assays for ALP mRNA at 24 h. (B)
  Detection of ALP activity on day 3. (C) Determination of ECM mineralization by stained
  with Alizarin red S on day 14. Relative means and standard deviations were shown
  underneath (P<0.001; scale bar: 50 µm). Data are expressed as mean ± SD for n=3;
  **, P<0.01 vs. NC; ***, P<0.001 vs. NC. NC, negative control; qRT-PCR, real-time
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ECM, extracellular
  matrix.'
