figure_title: ANXA9 regulates the apoptosis in breast cancer via p53 pathway
caption: A–E Si-ANXA9 decreased p53 expression in nucleus and increased it in cytoplasm;
  F–J OE-ANXA9 increased p53 expression in nucleus and decreased it in cytoplasm;
  K–O Si-ANXA9 treatment weakened the time-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation
  of p53 in BC cells in response to CHX and MG-132 treatment (relative gray values).
  ***p < 0.001. All of the experiments were replicated for three times.
article_title: ANXA9 facilitates S100A4 and promotes breast cancer progression through
  modulating STAT3 pathway.
