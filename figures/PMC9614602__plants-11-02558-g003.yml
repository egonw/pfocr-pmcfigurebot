caption: The heatmap of the 250 most differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. Cluster
  analysis was performed using the log2(FPKM + 1) value from larger to smaller. The
  green color indicates downregulated miRNAs while the red color shows upregulated
  miRNAs. IC-IR8 control (untreated); IT1-IR8 for 1 day low-light-treated; IT3-IR8
  for 3 days low-light-treated; IT5-IR8 for 5 days low-light-treated; SC-Swarnaprabha
  control (untreated); ST1-Swarnaprabha for 1 day low-light-treated; ST3-Swarnaprabha
  for 3 days low-light-treated; ST5-Swarnaprabha for 5 days low-light-treated.
