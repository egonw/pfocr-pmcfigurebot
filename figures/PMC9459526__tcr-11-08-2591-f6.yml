caption: Distribution pattern and gene enrichment of low- and high-risk groups. (A)
  Composition of 22 immune cells in low- and high-risk groups. (B) Correlation heat
  map of 22 immune cells in LUAD. (C) PCA for low- and high-risk groups based on risk
  genes, whole RBPs, whole IGs, and whole genome. (D) GSEA suggested differences in
  immune response and immune system process. (E) GSEA suggested differences in the
  KEGG pathway between the low- and high-risk groups. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; PCA,
  Principal components analysis; RBP, RNA-binding protein; IG, immune gene; GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
