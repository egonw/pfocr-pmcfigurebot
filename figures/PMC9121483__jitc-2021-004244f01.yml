caption: 'Deletion of Cish gene does not impact NK cell maturation but reveals upregulation
  of pathways in cell cycling and activation. (A, B) BM and/or splenic NK cells from
  Cish +/+Ncr1Ki/+ and Cish fl/flNcr1Ki/+ mice were phenotypically analyzed by FACS.
  (A) Frequency of NK cells in spleen and bone marrow (CD3-, CD19-, NK1.1+, NKp46+),
  representative FACS plots and histograms are shown. (B) Frequency of Imm, M1 and
  M2 cells were measured within NK cell populations from the spleen, representative
  FACS plots and histograms are shown. (C, F) Gene expression profiles of FACS sorted
  NK cells (NK1.1+, NKp46+, CD3-) were generated using RNA-sequencing. (C) A volcano
  plot of the top 60 significant (p<0.05) differentially expressed genes with a fold
  change above +1 or below âˆ’1 was generated. The y-axis is the negative log-p value
  and x-axis is the log-fold-change of the corresponding gene in Cish-/- vs Cish+/+
  comparison. Gene expression: blue=downregulated, red=upregulated. (D) Heatmap showing
  results of gene ontology analysis for genes in Cish-/- vs Cish+/+ comparison (From
  KEGG pathway analysis in black or GOBP in red), log-p value are indicated in blue
  color gradient and gene count in black color gradient. An upregulated list of genes
  associated with cell cycle (E) and natural cytotoxicity receptor pathways (F) (from
  KEGG pathway analysis) was generated with a p value cut-off of <0.05. x-axis is
  the log(FC) of each gene and p values are indicated by color. BM, bone marrow; GOPB,
  gene ontology biological process; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes;
  NCR, natural cytotoxicity receptor; NK, natural killer.'
