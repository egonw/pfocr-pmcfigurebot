caption: SLPI protein regulates multiple signaling pathways in tumor cells. (A, B)
  Western blot shows activation of the PI3K–AKT–GSK‐3β pathway in A2780 and Caov3
  cells in the presence (+) of rhSLPI. (C, D) Western blot analysis of members of
  the NF‐κB signaling pathway, including IKKα, p‐IKKα/β, IκBα, NF‐κB, and p‐NF‐κB.
  (E, F) Western blot analysis of MAPK and p‐MAPK protein levels in A2780 and Caov3
  cells with and without rhSLPI. The band intensity was assessed with ImageJ. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. NF‐κB, nuclear factor κB; SLPI, secretory leukocyte
  protease inhibitor. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
