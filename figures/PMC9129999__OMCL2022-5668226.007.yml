caption: 'SIRT1 is involved in the protection of CAT against flap necrosis through
  the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. (a, b) Immunofluorescence staining and quantitative
  analysis of SIRT1-positive cells in the dermal layer in control and CAT groups after
  the surgery (scan bar, 10 μm). (c, d) Western blotting result and quantification
  of SIRT1 in each group at day 7 after surgery. (e, f) Western blotting and quantification
  analysis of SIRT1, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR, and p-mTOR in the flaps from in the control,
  CAT, and CAT+EX527 groups. (g, h) Western blotting and quantification analysis of
  autophagy-related proteins Beclin1, CTSD, LC3II, and P62 in the control, CAT, and
  CAT+EX527 groups. (i, j) Western blotting and quantification analysis of VEGFA,
  eNOS, Bax, and Bcl-2 in the control, CAT, and CAT+EX527 groups. Significance: ∗p
  < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the control group. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. the CAT
  group. Data were expressed as means ± SEM, n = 6.'
