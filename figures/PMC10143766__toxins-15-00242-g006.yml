caption: 'IS induces expression of SASP factors and EMT markers: (A–C) Volcano plots
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points, and the top 10
  enrichment pathways from MSigDB Hallmark of DEGs in IS-treatment groups compared
  to non-treatment groups. Volcano plots are representative of DEGs of ciPTEC-OAT1
  cultured at 37 °C for 1 to 9 days with or without IS (200 µM) exposure (adj.p <
  0.05, |log2 fold change| > 1.5). The most significant DEGs are involved in TNF-alpha
  Signaling via NF-ĸB and Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition pathway from MSigDB Hallmark.'
