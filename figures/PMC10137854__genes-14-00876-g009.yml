caption: Transcriptome response of the immune system by KEGG pathway analysis and
  single mutation variant detection between M. chilensis populations. (A) Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) and (C) apoptosis signaling pathway comparisons between mussels from
  Yaldad and Cochamó. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and amino acid changes are shown
  in blue and brown boxes according to the mussel population. Identified gene families
  on the KEGG pathways are marked with red in the M. chilensis genome. (B,D) Transcriptome
  patterns of coding genes analyzed in gills and mantle tissue from the Yaldad and
  Cochamó populations for TLR and apoptosis-related genes. Three replicates were evaluated
  from each experimental group. The heatmap was based on transcripts per million (TPM)
  calculation and hierarchical clustering on Manhattan distances with average linkage.
  Red colors mean upregulated coding genes and blue colors represent downregulated
  genes.
