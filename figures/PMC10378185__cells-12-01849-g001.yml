caption: 'Identifying biomarkers of growth and carrying capacity: (A) Logistic growth
  curves fit to the cell counts of eight gastric cancer cell lines at various stages
  of their growth. Fits were shifted along the x-axis such that the midpoint of each
  curve lay above . The eight cell lines differed in their maximum growth rate (r),
  as well as their maximum sustainable population size (K). (B) Summary statistics
  of linear regression models used to correlate KEGG pathway activity levels with
  logistic function growth parameters. The top five models and their performance in
  the training cell lines are shown for growth rate (r: light gray rows) and carrying
  capacity (K: dark gray). Columns: Pearson = Pearson correlation coefficient; P =
  FDR corrected p-value;  = adjusted . (C,D) Relation between growth parameters ()
  and the model with best performance in the validation dataset: ‘Amoebiasis’ (C)
  and ‘Arginine and proline metabolism’ (D), respectively. Pathway activity quantified
  using AUCell with scRNA-seq data. Error bars represent median absolute deviation.
  (E) Clonal composition confirmed by both scDNA- and scRNA-seq in eight gastric cancer
  cell lines (data taken from []). (F,G) Violin plots showing predicted values for
  clonal growth rate as a function of ‘Amoebiasis’ activity (F), and clonal carrying
  capacity as a function of ‘Arginine and proline metabolism’ activity (G). Wilcoxon
  signed rank test: o p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. If a cell line had more than
  three significant clone pairs, we displayed only the three highest p-values below
  0.1.'
