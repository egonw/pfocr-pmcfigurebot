figure_title: RNA-seq and enrichment analysis of tumor tissues from MCR and CTR groups
caption: A The heatmap showed the top 50 differentially expressed genes. B KEGG enrichment
  analyzed on dysregulated genes. C The diagram showed GO term, which was based on
  GO annotation. D Chord diagrams showed a correlation between DEGs and KEGG pathway.
  E Western blot was performed to detect expression of Bcl-2, cleaved PARP and GPX4
  in tumor tissues derived from the ECA109 xenograft tumor model. Tumors tissues were
  harvested on day 31 and tumor tissues for protein assay were kept in the –80 °C
  refrigerator, the experiments were performed within a week to ensure the reliable
  quality of tumor tissues. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).
