caption: Hemocytesâ€™ immune response during viral infections. Hypothetical model of
  possible functions of hemocytes during viral infection. Blood meal contains viruses
  that trigger the production of digestive enzymes and midgut distention, which disrupt
  cellular junctions and cause apoptosis in midgut epithelium cells (gray square cells).
  These effects facilitate virus dissemination, allowing infection of cells and trachea
  via gaps in the cellular junctions and via apoptosis of cells. Viruses released
  from the midgut epithelium can be freely transported in the hemolymph or by infected
  hemocytes (circular purple (uninfected) and pink cells (infected)) that are distributed
  in the flowing hemolymph to secondary tissues, such as fat bodies and salivary glands,
  which receive the virus through the tracheal system. Hemocytes can facilitate the
  entry of a virus into cells of various tissues through the production of mosquito
  galactose-specific C-type lectins (mosGCTLs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (mosPTPs).
  However, hemocytes also produce phenoloxidase (PO), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs),
  and thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), which are involved in virus elimination.
  In addition, in the later stages of infection, hemocytes take up free viruses by
  endocytosis or phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, together with cellular debris containing
  virus and dsRNA; they then develop viral small interfering RNAs (vsRNAs) that are
  released by exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) to enter infected cells and confer virus
  resistance through the RNAi pathway. Finally, hemocytes can also eliminate viruses
  by autophagy.
