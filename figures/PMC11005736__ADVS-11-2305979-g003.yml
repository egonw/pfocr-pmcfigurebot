caption: Mn‐N/C activates type I IFN signaling by cGAS/STING‐dependent cytosolic DNA
  sensing. A) GO enrichment gene analysis of pathways in tumor tissues of MC38‐bearing
  mice with vehicle or Mn‐N/C treatment. B) GSEA analysis of enrichment of CD8+ T
  cell effector signatures in tumor tissues of MC38 tumor‐bearing mice with vehicle
  or Mn‐N/C treatment. C) GSEA analysis of enrichment of ROS pathway signatures in
  tumor tissues of MC38‐bearing mice with vehicle or Mn‐N/C treatment. D) Heatmap
  of type I IFN gene signatures in tumor tissues of MC38‐bearing mice with vehicle
  or Mn‐N/C treatment. E) Real‐time PCR analysis of Ifna, Ifnb, Irf7, Isg15, and Cxcl10
  gene expression levels in MC38 tumor cells treated with H2O2, Mn‐N/C, or plus with
  NAC (1 mm) for 24 h. Data are shown as mean±SEM (n = 3). Two‐tailed unpaired t‐test
  was performed for the comparisons between the two groups. F) Cytosolic amount of
  gDNA and mtDNA in MC38 tumor cells treated with H2O2, Mn‐N/C, or plus with NAC (1 mm)
  treatment for 24 h. Data are shown as mean±SEM (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA and Sidak's
  multiple comparisons test were performed. G) Real‐time PCR analysis of Ifna and
  Ifnb expression in MC38 tumor cells treated with Mn‐N/C and H2O2, or plus with DNase
  for 24 h. Data are shown as mean±SEM (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA and Sidak's multiple
  comparisons test were performed. H) Real‐time PCR analysis of Ifna and Ifnb expression
  in MC38 tumor cells treated with Mn‐N/C, H2O2, or plus with STING inhibitor H151
  for 24 h. Data are shown as mean±SEM (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA and Sidak's multiple
  comparisons test were performed. I) Real‐time PCR analysis of Ifna and Ifnb expression
  in WT, Cgas −/−, Sting −/− MC38 tumor cells treated with H2O2, Mn‐N/C for 24 h.
  Data are shown as mean±SEM (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA and Sidak's multiple comparisons
  test were performed. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001;
