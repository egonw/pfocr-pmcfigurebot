caption: 'The mechanisms of PM2.5-induced asthma. Exposure to PM2.5 can damage airway
  epithelial cells, cause lung inflammation and oxidative stress, and induce the release
  of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α). Meanwhile, exposure to PM2.5
  causes airway epithelial cells and the endoplasmic reticulum release calcium ions,
  which activates and phosphorylates the MAPK family, leading to increased gene transcription
  (NF-κB, AP-1), promoting the release of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, thus activating T2
  inflammatory response and inducing airway hyperresponsiveness. In addition, exposure
  to PM2.5 can induce autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and elevate
  autophagy by affecting the expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and the
  production of NO, as well as TGF-β1 expression, causing airway remodeling. SOD:
  superoxide dismutase; HO-1: heme oxygenase 1; AHR: airway hyperresponsiveness.'
