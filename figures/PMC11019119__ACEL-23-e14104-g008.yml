caption: Metabolomic differences between healthy and rapid agers. (a) Difference in
  metabolomic profiles between healthy and rapid agers as evidenced from Orthogonal
  partial least square‐discriminant analysis (OPLS‐DA) score plot. (b) Receiver operating
  curve analysis (ROC) was performed to identify metabolites associated with healthy
  and rapid agers. Metabolites with AUCcomb (combined area under the curve) value
  >0.5 and adjusted q < 0.05 were predictive of healthy agers, whereas metabolites
  with an AUCcomb < 0.5 and q < 0.05 were predictive of rapid agers; grey spots represent
  non‐significant metabolites (c) Pathway‐enrichment analysis was performed using
  Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Network of enriched pathways in rapid agers
  shows alterations in amino acid (AA) biosynthesis. (d) Major disease and biofunction
  pathways associated with predictors of rapid agers are depicted in the bubble plot.
  Pathways are represented in y‐axis and the size of the bubble indicates the number
  of metabolites identified in each pathway. The q‐values were obtained following
  Benjamini–Hochberg correction of p‐values.
