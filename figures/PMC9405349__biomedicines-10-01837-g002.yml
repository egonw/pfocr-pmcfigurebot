caption: Knockdown of GLUT3 in SW620 cells reduces EMT process. (A) Western blot analysis
  was conducted for measuring the protein levels of GLUT3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  snail, twist, α-SMA, CTGF, fibronectin 1 and vimentin, PAI-1 and ZEB1 in shGLUT3-induced
  SW620 cells. (B) qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the mRNA levels of GLUT3, E-cadherin
  (E-cad), N-cadherin (N-Cad), snail, twist, α-SMA, CTGF, fibronectin 1 (FN1) and
  vimentin (Vim), PAI-1 and ZEB1 in shGLUT3-transfected SW620 cells. (C) shGLUT3 was
  analyzed after 48 h using cell invasion assay to allow for the permeabilization
  of the transwell membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition;
  α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; ZEB1, zinc
  finger E-box binding homeobox 1, qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR;
  CTGF, connective tissue growth factor. Data are the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
  significance was analyzed by analysis of variance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001, significantly different compared with control.
