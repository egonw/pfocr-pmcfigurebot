caption: 'SRC signaling is involved in the regulation of MLC2 by BDNF.A, DIV7 neurons
  subjected to starvation were pretreated with inhibitors of three established signaling
  pathways downstream of TrkB: U0126 (a MAPK signaling pathway inhibitor, 10 μM),
  U73122 (a PLC-gamma signaling pathway inhibitor, 10 μM), and LY294002 (a PI3K signaling
  pathway inhibitor, 10 μM) for 30 min. This treatment was followed by BDNF treatment
  (50 ng/ml) for 2 h, and cells were then lysed to collect proteins to examine the
  activity of the three signaling pathways downstream of TrkB as well as the levels
  of MLC2 and p-MLC2. The experiment was performed in triplicate. B, data are shown
  as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent replicates; Student’s t test, ∗p< 0.05.
  C and D, after being pretreated for 30 min with PP1 (10 μM), cells were stimulated
  with BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 2 h and lysed, and the protein levels of MLC2 and p-MLC2
  were determined by Western blotting. The assay was performed with three independent
  replicates. The data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. values; Student’s t test, of
  three independent replicates, ∗p < 0.05. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  DIV, days in vitro; MLC, myosin light chain.'
