caption: Cucurbitacin B inhibited the TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of RelA.
  A549 cells were pretreated with or without cucurbitacin B for 1 h and were then
  treated with (+) or without (−) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) for 30 min in the presence or
  absence of cucurbitacin B at the indicated final concentrations, followed by the
  preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Western blots are representative
  of two independent experiments.
