caption: Noradrenergic pathway was assessed by DβH, ADRA1a, ADRA2a, and ADRB1 at 12
  months post different severities of injury within PFC (left), STR (middle) and SN
  (right). (a,e,i) Relative density of DβH. (b,f,j) Relative density of ADRA1a. (c,g,k)
  Relative density of ADRA2a. (d,h,l) Relative density of ADRB1. GAPDH was used as
  a housekeeper protein for analysis. Outliers were removed (n = 0–2 per group) and
  one-way ANOVA was performed. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01. n = 5–7 per group. Representative images of the Western blots were extracted
  from Image Studio Lite. For clearer DBH images, please refer to .
