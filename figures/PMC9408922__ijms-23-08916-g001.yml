caption: 'Folates and One-Carbon Cycles. There are 2 slow steps driven by DHFR, dihydrofolate
  reductase, allowing the entry of folic acid (FA) into the folate cycle. FA binds
  preferentially to folate receptor alpha (FolÎ±) and is then internalized. Then, the
  MTHFR SNPs (methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase single-nucleotide polymorphisms)
  can alter the capacity to generate MTHF (MethylTetraHydrofolate), the only active
  compound interacting with the Methionine Synthase (MS), to regenerate Methionine
  from Homocysteine (Hcy). 5 MTHF is preferentially transported into the cells via
  the transporter SLC19A1 (reduced folates transporter, Solute carrier). Homocysteine
  can be recycled in 2 steps to form cystathionine, then cysteine: this pathway is
  not expressed in the early preimplantation embryo and is weak/absent in placenta.
  Another pathway using betaine allows the regeneration of homocysteine to methionine
  and forms dimethylglycine. This pathway BHMT (Betaine Homocysteine Transferase:
  BHMT; DMG: Dimethyl Glycine) is also poorly active in the early embryo and placenta.
  S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) releases a methyl group on the target molecules and
  forms S-adenosyl homocysteine. Exclamation mark symbols indicate two crucial steps
  that regulate entry of FA into the folates cycle and its activity.'
