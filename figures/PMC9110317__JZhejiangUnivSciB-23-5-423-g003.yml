  treatment with LPS at different concentrations. (b‍‒‍f) The qRT-PCR analyses of
  lnc78583 as well as HOXB13, TNF-‍α, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA expression levels after
  treatment with or without LPS in FHC. (g) The qRT-PCR analysis indicates that lnc78583-overexpressing
  vector is successfully transfected into FHC after LPS treatment. (h, i) The qRT-PCR
  analyses of HOXB13 and IL-10 mRNA expression levels after overexpressing lnc78583
  or not. (j) The protein expression levels of HOXB13, p-NF-‍κB, and NF‍-‍κB after
  overexpressing lnc78583 or not by western blot. (k, l) The gray values of HOXB13
  and p-NF-‍κB protein expression related to NF-‍κB after overexpressing lnc78583
  or not were analyzed by ImageJ software. (m) The CCK8 analysis illustrates the cell
  viability of FHC after overexpressing lnc78583 or not. (n) LDH release of FHC after

  group lnc78583 stands for transfecting with lnc78583-overexpressing vector after
  LPS treatment. Data are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean (SEM), n=11.
