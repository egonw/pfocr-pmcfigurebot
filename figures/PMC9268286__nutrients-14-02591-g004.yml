caption: 'Drug D, targeting GSDMD, protects against L-arginine-induced necrotic cell
  death pathway activation in isolated primary mice acinar cells. (a) The chemical
  structure of Diosgenin (ai) and Drug D (aii). (b) Scheme of molecular docking. The
  S-nitrosylation site of GSDMD (C140) is boxed. (c,d) The quantification of primary
  acinar cell necrosis treated with L-arginine (60 mM) and Drug D/Diosgenin at indicated
  dose and representative image of Hoechst 33342 (blue) and PI (red) staining of primary
  acinar cells. Scale bars, 100 μm. All values were shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 5).
  #p < 0.05 compared with control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001 compared with mice acute pancreatitis model groups. ANOVA was used in
  (c).'
