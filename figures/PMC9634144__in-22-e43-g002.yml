figure_title: OCI-101 inhibits RANKL- and M-CSF-induced signaling. (A) The effect
  of OCI-101 on RANKL-induced signaling pathway. The cultured BMMs were preincubated
  with 100 µM OCI-101 for 12 h, and the cells were stimulated with RANKL (200 ng/ml)
  for the indicated times. The cells were then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies
  recognizing phosphorylated and total IκBα, p65, p38, ERK and JNK (left panel). β-Actin
  was used as the loading control. The relative level of phosphorylated proteins was
  calculated after normalization to total protein input (right panel). (B) The effect
  of OCI-101 on M-CSF-induced signaling pathway
