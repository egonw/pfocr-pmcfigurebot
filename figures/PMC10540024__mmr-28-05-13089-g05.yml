caption: AZ inhibits ferroptosis in osteoarthritis through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
  Chondrocytes were pretreated with IL-1β (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, with or without ML385
  (Nrf2 inhibitors) or Fer-1 (60 nmol/ml) for 12 h, and then treated with or without
  AZ (100 µM) for an additional 24 h. (A) Protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1
  and GPX4 was determined by western blotting. (B) Nrf2 staining of ferroptosis in
  chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were pretreated with IL-1β (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, with
  or without tin protoporphyrin IX (HO-1 inhibitors) or Fer-1 (60 nmol/ml) for 12
  h, and then treated with or without AZ (100 µM) for an additional 24 h. (C) Protein
  expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and GPX4 was determined by western blotting. (D)
  Schematic diagram showing how AZ affects ferroptosis through the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway. AZ, acetyl zingerone; DMM, destabilization of the medial meniscus; Fer-1,
  ferrostatin-1; GPX, glutathione peroxidase 4; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; Nrf2, nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.
