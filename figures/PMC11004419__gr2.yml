caption: The effect of MEL on TM-treated granulosa cells. (A) Cell viability determined
  by the CCK8 analysis. (B) Apoptosis percentage of granulosa cells between CON, TM,
  TM+MEL, TM + MEL+4-PBA, and TM + MEL+TG. (C) Fluoresce intensity of granulosa cells
  between CON, TM, TM+MEL, TM + MEL+4-PBA, and TM + MEL+TG group. (D) ROS production
  detected by DCFH-DA. (E) Representative flow cytometric analyses of Annexin V and
  PI staining. All the experiments were repeated for 3 times and all values are means
  ± SE. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
