figure_title: Low expression of GBA1 is associated with the metastatic potential of
  liver cancer cells
caption: A Lipidomic analysis of sphingolipids in 3 pairs of liver cancer tissues
  (T) and the paired adjacent nontumorous liver tissues (ANLT). B Representative images
  of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of GBA1 in liver cancer tissues (T) and paired
  adjacent nontumorous liver tissue (ANLT). Scale bar, 100 μm. C Quantitative analysis
  of GBA1 protein levels in 233 paired samples of T and ANLT according to IHC scores.
  Statistical significance was analysed by Student’s t test. D ROC curve analyses
  show the diagnostic potential of GBA1 in liver cancer. E Quantitative analysis of
  GBA1 protein levels in T1 (n = 62), T2 (n = 121), and T3 (n = 46) stages according
  to IHC scores. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, and LSD
  was performed after ANOVA to as a post hoc multiple comparison test. F Representative
  images of IHC stained GBA1 in tissues in the T1 and T3 stage. G Quantitative analysis
  of GBA1 protein levels in the nonvascular invasion (NVI, n = 125) and vascular invasion
  (VI, n = 21) groups according to IHC scores. H Representative images of IHC staining
  of GBA1 in the cases with PVTT and non-PVTT. I Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis
  of GBA1 mRNA in the non-PVTT (n = 33) and PVTT (n = 33) groups. Statistical significance
  was determined by chi-square test. The data are shown as the percentage of total
  specimens. J, K Western blot analysis of GBA1 protein in liver cancer cell lines
  with different metastatic potentials and relative GBA1 protein expression in different
  liver cancer cell lines. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant.
