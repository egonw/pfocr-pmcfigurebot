caption: 'Effect of DI-10 on mitochondrial biogenesis pathway protein expression under
  high-glucose conditions. (A) DI-10 improves the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating
  factors in myotubes in high-glucose conditions through NRF-1 and TFam. (B) Graph
  showing densitometric analysis. *** p < 0.001 and * p < 0.05 compared to control
  and ### p < 0.001, ## p < 0.01 and # p < 0.05 compared to the high glucose.'
