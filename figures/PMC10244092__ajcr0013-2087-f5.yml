caption: Signaling pathway analysis and variation spectrums between eBM-NK and eUC-NK.
  (A, B) KEGG analysis (A) and pathway correlation assay (B) of hAMSCs in eBM-NK and
  eUC-NK based on DEGs. (C, D) GSEA diagrams of significantly different gene sets
  (C) and non-different gene sets (D) between eBM-NK and eUC-NK. (E) PPI analysis
  of the DEGs (log2FC >1.0) between eBM-NK and eUC-NK. (F) KDA analysis of the DEGs
  (log2FC >1.0) between eBM-NK and eUC-NK. (G) Variable shear events in eBM-NK and
  eUC-NK. (H) The distribution of the differentially VSE (DVSE) between eBM-NK and
  eUC-NK. (I) Circos diagrams revealed the distribution of fusion genes in eBM-NK
  and eUC-NK.
