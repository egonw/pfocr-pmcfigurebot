caption: High ADAR1 expression correlates with poor PFS in Ovarian cancer. (A) mRNA
  levels of ADAR1 in ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovarian surface epithelium
  tissues were quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. ADAR1 expression
  was normalized by GAPDH expression and each of the noncancerous ovarian surface
  epithelium tissues were used as a control. Data were shown as mean ± SD (***, P
  < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P< 0.05. (B) Protein levels of ADAR1 in ovarian cancer
  tissues (T) and normal ovarian surface epithelium tissues (N) were determined by
  Western blot. GAPDH expression served as endogenous reference. (C) Quantification
  analysis of ADAR1 protein levels of (B) by gray values were shown as mean ± SD (***,
  P < 001; **, P < 0.01; *, P< 0.05). (D) Assessment of ADAR1 protein expression in
  ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovarian surface epithelium tissues by immunohistochemical
  analysis. The representative microphotographs showed high, moderate, and low staining
  of ADAR1 in tissue array. Upper scale bar, 200 µm; lower scale bar, 50 µm. (E) Quantification
  analysis of ADAR1 protein stain of (D) by H scores. Data were shown as mean ± SD
  (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05). (F) Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-free
  survival of ovarian cancer patients according to the expression level of ADAR1 protein
  in ovarian cancer tissues (ADAR1 High-expression, n = 462 and ADAR1 Low-expression,
  n = 973).
