caption: SeNPs regulated the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the Wnt/β-Catenin
  signaling pathway. (A) Expression of Wnt3, GSK-3, p-GSK-3, catenin, p-catenin, cyclin
  D, neuro D1 and neurogenin assessed by western blot. Actin was used as the internal
  control. (B) Quantitative analysis of protein contents among the three groups. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by one-way analysis of variance.
