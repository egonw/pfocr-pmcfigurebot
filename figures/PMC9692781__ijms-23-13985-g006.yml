caption: 'Development of histological and transplantation methodologies. In comparison
  to conventional sectioning methods, the use of tissue clearing allowed for complete
  visualization of the TE-NSPs in vivo while avoiding damage to the TE-NSPs during
  traditional thin sectioning. (a) Representative confocal reconstruction of an enriched
  TE-NSP immediately following implantation labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote
  dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red). Tissue clearing enabled a global perspective
  on implant integrity and trajectory. (b) Representative confocal reconstruction
  of an enriched TE-NSP immediately following implantation labeled via immunocytochemistry
  to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red) and all neurons/axons (β-tubulin
  III, green). Structures as small as neuronal somata and individual neurites could
  be imaged with ease using tissue clearing in conjunction with confocal microscopy.
  (c,d) Representative confocal reconstructions of enriched TE-NSP immediately following
  implantation labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons
  (TH, red). The original delivery process was found to occasionally damage the TE-NSP
  neurons and axonal projections due to the delivery needle coring out brain tissue.
  In these two examples, the TE-NSP axons within the lumen were compressed due to
  forces from cored brain tissue pushed into the needle (each large TH+ mass shows
  undulated axons within the lumen). (e) In order to prevent the compression of the
  TE-NSP by the brain during implantation, a needle sheath with a breakable seal was
  used to cover the end of the needle. This methodology consisted of the following
  steps: (1) The construct was loaded into the implantation needle; (2) once loaded,
  the sheath was slid onto the needle and completely covered the end of the needle
  (not shown); (3) the whole apparatus (needle and sheath) was lowered into the brain
  to the correct depth (the dashed line represents the brain surface); and (4) forceps
  were used to pull the sheath upwards, which breaks the seal on the end of the needle
  and left the construct exposed at the correct depth in the brain. As with the original
  methodology, a plunger was used to hold the TE-NSP in place while the needle and
  sheath were removed from the brain, thereby depositing the intact TE-NSP in the
  wake of the needle. Scale bar (a) = 200 µm. Scale bar (b) = 50 µm. Scale bar (c,d)
  = 50 µm.'
