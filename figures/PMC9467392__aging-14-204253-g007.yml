caption: 'PPI network and KEGG pathway analysis. (A) PPI network of the significant
  genes in BC. (a) The PPI network was constructed using 40 genes selected from the
  string web database. (b) Construction of CCNB1 subnetwork of PPI. (B) KEGG pathway
  analysis; CCNB1 are involved in the cell cycle. Abbreviations: DEGs: differentially
  expressed genes; GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes;
  PPI: protein-protein interaction.'
