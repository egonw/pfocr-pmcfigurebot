caption: The triangle relationship between lncRNAs, the RIG-I signaling pathway, and
  glycolysis. LncRNAs promote HK activity abd lactate production. Lactate negatively
  regulates MAVS and subsequently impress TBK1-IRF3 activation and IFN-I production.
  Mitochondria HK activity inac-tivated, and glycolysis is suffered blocks during
  RIG-I activation. LncRNA IGFBP4–1 increases the expression of HK through their miR
  sponge. It could be that lncRNAs regulate HK and inhibit the binding of MAVS to
  RIG-I, thereby inhibiting the intensity of the RIG-I signaling pathway.
