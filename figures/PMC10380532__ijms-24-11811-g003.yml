caption: 'Schematic representation of crosstalk between gut microbes and the mTOR
  signaling pathway in different diseases. Gut microbes directly or indirectly stimulate
  mTOR through changes in their own abundance or metabolites (mainly SCFAs), integrating
  intra- and extracellular signals, which in turn influence disease development. A
  detailed description of these interactions is provided in the main text. Arrows
  represent activation, and horizontal lines indicate inhibition. The differently
  colored lines represent different regulatory mechanisms. Abbreviations: AMPK: AMP-activated
  protein kinase; ERK1/2: Extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2; ROS: Reactive
  oxygen species; SCFAs: Short-chain fatty acids; IL33: Interleukin-33; IL-22: Interleukin-22;
  CTSK: Cathepsin K; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TAMs: Tumor-associated macrophages.'
