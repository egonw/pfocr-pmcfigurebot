caption: 'Administration of Fn1 inhibitor restored the I/R-induced decrease in glucose
  and fatty acid uptake in I/R hearts. (a) Representative PET images of axial (top),
  coronal (middle), and sagittal (bottom) cardiac sections with [18F]-FDG in mice
  at 24 or 72 hours after I/RI (left) and quantification of the left ventricular (LV)/blood
  standard uptake values (SUV) for saline or RGDS-treated mice (right, n = 3), showing
  myocardial glucose uptake. (b) Representative PET images: axial (top), coronal (middle),
  and sagittal (bottom) cardiac sections with [18F]-FTHA in mice at 24 or 72 hours
  after I/RI (left) and quantification of the LV/blood SUV for saline or RGDS-treated
  mice (right, n = 3), showing myocardial fatty acid (FA) uptake. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus the sham-operated group; ##P
  < 0.01; ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 24 h; &&P < 0.01; &&&P <
  0.001, &&&&P < 0.0001 versus saline I/R 72 h.'
