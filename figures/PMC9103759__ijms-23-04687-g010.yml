caption: 'Effects of acacetin (AC) on the AMPK pathway in FL83B cells. FL83B cells
  treated with 0.5 mM oleic acid (OA) for 48 h, followed by 24 h of treatment with
  30 μM AC with or without an AMPK inhibitor (compound c). Gene expression levels
  of FAS, ATGL, and CPT-1 were assayed using real-time PCR. The fold values calculated
  relative to β-actin expression. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 indicate significant differences compared to OA treatment. # p < 0.05
  indicate significant differences compared to compound c treatment.'
