caption: 'Gradual temperature increase to 45 °C significantly phosphorylates insulin
  signaling pathway biomolecules. (A) Real-time temperature measurement of the cells
  incubated at 45 °C (N = 4). Representative immunoblotting image of (B) C2C12 cells,
  (C) HepG2 cells, and (D) Fao cells. Cells were starved for 24 h and were positioned
  in 45 °C incubation from 0 to 30 min. Insulin stimulation: 50 nM, 10 min. The phosphorylation
  change (Left, C2C12 cells; Middle, HepG2 cells; Right, Fao cells) was quantified
  for (E) IRS1, (F) pAkt(S473), (G) GSK3β, (H) p70S6K, (I) FoxO1, and (J) ERK1/2.
  Columns are mean ± 95% confidence intervals (N = 4 independent experiment). Results
  were normalized by β-actin (* p = 0.0021; ** p = 0.0002; *** p < 0.001; One-way
  ANOVA; Dunnett’s test compared to negative control).'
