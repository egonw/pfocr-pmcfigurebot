caption: PLX8394‐based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) induced degradation
  of BRAFV600E. A‐C, Protein knockdown activities of CRBN(BRAF)s. A375 cells were
  treated with the indicated concentrations of CRBN(BRAF)s for 24 h. D, CRBN(BRAF)‐24
  induced sustained downregulation of BRAF protein levels. A375 cells were treated
  with the indicated concentrations of CRBN(BRAF)s for the indicated periods. E, CRBN(BRAF)‐24,
  but not CRBN(BRAF)‐29, led to efficient suppression of BRAF protein levels and pathway
  signaling. SK‐MEL‐28 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of CRBN(BRAF)‐24
  or CRBN(BRAF)‐29 for 24 h. Whole‐cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
  with the indicated antibodies. Numbers below the BRAF, pMEK1/2, and pERK1/2 panels
  represent the BRAF/actin, pMEK/MEK, and pERK/ERK ratios, respectively, normalized
  by designating the level of the vehicle control condition as 100%. Data in the bar
  graph are the mean (± SD) of two or three independent experiments
