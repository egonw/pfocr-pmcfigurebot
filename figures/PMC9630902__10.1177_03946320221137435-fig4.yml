caption: 'Effects of Lut/ZnO NPs on SREBP1c protein expression in hepatic tissues
  of NAFLD rat model. Values were expressed as Means Â± SE (n = 6). a: denote significant
  change versus control, b: denote significant change versus Lut/ZnO NPs, c: denote
  significant change versus HFD and d: denote significant change versus HFD+STZ at
  p < 0.05.'
