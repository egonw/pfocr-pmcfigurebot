caption: 'The signaling pathway of ROR1/2 in pediatric NB progression. The initiation
  of ROR1 signaling commences with the binding of a non-canonical WNT ligand, which
  triggers the formation of a complex involving either ROR1 and ROR2 or ROR1 and a
  FZD receptor. It triggers the phosphorylation of ROR1 by various kinases, inhibiting
  anti-apoptotic pathways and activating pathways such as MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and
  NF-ÎºB. These pathways prompt cytoskeletal changes, enhance tumor cell migration,
  and promote gene expression linked to cell proliferation, survival, EMT, and therapy
  resistance. ROR1, Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1; WNT, Wingless/Integrated;
  FZD, Frizzled receptors; RAS, Rat sarcoma; RAF, Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma;
  MEK, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Akt, Ak strain transforming; EMT, Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions;
  ASK1, Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; MKK3/6, MAP kinase 3/6; STAT3, Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3.'
