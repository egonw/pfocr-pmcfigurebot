figure_title: NO-ferroheme vasorelaxation is mediated by the sGC/PKG pathway
caption: Ex vivo vasorelaxation responses of mouse aortic rings to increasing concentrations
  of NO-ferroheme-Mb. a,b, The responses to NO-ferroheme-Mb were abolished by simultaneous
  treatment with ODQ (10 μM), a cell-permeable and potent inhibitor of sGC (placebo,
  n = 4; ODQ, n = 4) (a), but sensitized by the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (1 μM)
  placebo, n = 4; sildenafil, n = 4) (b). c, Simultaneous addition of X (0.37 mM)
  and XO (5 mU ml−1), to induce superoxide production and alter the redox status,
  attenuated the response to NO-ferroheme-Mb (placebo, n = 3; X/XO, n = 2). d, In
  isolated rat aortic segments treated with the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (300 µM), co-incubation
  with NO-ferroheme-Mb (0.5 µM) significantly increased pVASP, thus indicating the
  activation of the sGC/PKG pathway. Data in a–c were analyzed by two-way repeated
  measures ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. Vasorelaxation responses
  are shown as percent of PE-induced plateau, and the data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.
  n in a–c represents the number of mouse aortic rings used in different myograph
  chambers. Data in d were analyzed by nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed
  by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test and presented as mean ± s.d. Dots in d represent
  different aortic segments from three different rounds of western blot analysis.
  In a–d, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01 and ****P ≤ 0.0001.
