caption: Chemical structures of withaferin A derivatives, novel SMO inhibitors that
  structurally deviate from Vismodegib. (A) Chemical structure of natural product
  withaferin A. The highlighted scaffold is believed to be important for SMO binding.
  (B,C) The Waldman group developed derivatives of withaferin A that exhibited stereoselective
  potent inhibition of SMO. (D) The target compound of the Passarella group for SMO
  inhibition did not inhibit the Hh pathway. * represent asymmetric carbons. (E,F)
  Synthetic intermediates 13b and 14b exhibited stereoselective inhibition of SMO,
  elucidating important polarity considerations for protein interactions.
