caption: The adaptive evolution of phospholipids in the cell membrane in the hadal
  environment(A) Phylogenetic tree constructed by FastTree (version 2.1.11) using
  the Jones-Taylor-Thorton (JTT) model of amino acid evolution based on protein sequences
  containing acyl-coenzyme A oxidase N-terminal (Acyl-CoA_ox_N) show that ACOX1 genes,
  encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the DHA synthesis pathway, expanded in the
  YHSC genome.(B) DHA synthesis pathway. The ACOX1 in red refers to expansion in the
  YHSC genome, while the ACAA1 in green, encoding another rate-limiting enzyme, underwent
  expansion in the hadal snailfish P. swirei.(C) DHA content in phospholipids from
  A. japonicus and the YHSC. ∗∗, p < 0.01 (Student’s t test) Statistical details can
  be found in the  section.(D) The production of phosphatidylethanolamine (one of
  the most abundant components of the cell membrane) catalyzed by EPT1. EPT1 is a
  gene that experienced convergent evolution between the YHSC and P. swirei.(E) Multiple
  sequence alignment of EPT1. Amino acids unique to the YHSC or P. swirei are indicated
  by arrows.
