caption: Pathway analysis associated with CSBV infection was carried out by MetaboAnalyst.
  The Y-axis, “Log10 (p)”, represented the transformation of the original p-value
  calculated from the enrichment analysis. The X-axis represents the pathway impact
  value calculated from the pathway topology analysis, and larger bubbles represent
  higher pathway impact values.
