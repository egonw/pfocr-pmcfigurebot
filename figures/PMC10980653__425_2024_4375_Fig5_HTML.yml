caption: DEGs enriched in the photosynthesis pathway under 7 DAH. a The heatmap of
  photosynthesis pathway-related DEGs in R. moulmainense leaves after heat- and mock
  treatment for 4 h and 7 days. b Analyses of Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, qP, and ETR in the mock-
  and heat-treated R. moulmainense leaves at 4 HAH and 7 DAH. c Effects of the heat
  stress on reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activity
  in R. moulmainense. Mean values ± SE, n = 3. Different letters above the bars in
  b and c indicate statistically significant differences between the treatments, determined
  using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple test (P < 0.05). d, e WGCNA analyses.
  In section d, a dendrogram of gene clusters based on topological overlap is shown,
  with modules represented by assigned colors. Each branch on the tree represents
  a module, and each leaf on the branch corresponds to a single gene. In section e,
  the associations between modules and phenotypic traits are displayed. Each row indicates
  a module, and the number of genes in each module is indicated on the left. Each
  column indicates a specific phenotypic trait, labeled below. The cells at the row–column
  intersection contain the correlation coefficient (|r|, 0.5 not shown) and the P-value
  (in brackets) for the correlation between that module and the respective trait.
  Dark red indicates a highly positive correlation between a specific module and a
  trait, while blue indicates a negative correlation. The gray module is reserved
  for genes that do not fall into any specific module
