caption: 'GSCA online database was selected to analyze the single nucleotide variation
  and pathway activity of validated genes. (A): Waterfall plots, give a single nucleotide
  variation in BREAST gene sets. (B): Effects of the validated gene on cell pathway
  activity, gene expression was divided into 2 groups (High and Low) by median expression,
  the difference of pathway activity score (PAS) between groups was defined by student
  t-test, p-value was adjusted by FDR, FDR â‰¤0.05 was considered as significant. The
  pathway activity module presents the correlation of gene expression with pathway
  activity groups (activation and inhibition) that are defined by pathway scores.'
