figure_title: Pattern similarity development throughout learning
caption: Changes in hippocampal subregions’ pattern similarities over the course of
  the first 4 epochs of learning, within a full trial for an example AB pair (model
  timing equivalent to 100 ms), for the Theremin (top row) and NoEDL models (bottom
  row). Each line reflects the correlation of the current-time activity pattern relative
  to the activity pattern at the end of the trial. Two major effects are evident.
  First, the CA1 pattern learns over epochs to quickly converge on the final plus-phase
  activation state, based on learning in the CA3 → CA1 pathway. Second, the Theremin
  model shows how the CA3 pattern learns over epochs to converge on the DG-driven
  activation state that arises after cycle 25, reflecting CA3 error-driven learning.
  Additionally, big-loop signals from ECout back to ECin could be observed from cycle
  25 to 75 in the first epoch for both models (shifting CA3 patterns slightly off
  its final patterns). Drops seen within the first few cycles were due to the settling
  of temporally different patterns and were not of interest to the current paper.
