caption: 'Effect of siLOXL2 on the expression of TGF-β1/Smad3/NF-κB pathway and inflammatory
  response. H9c2 cells are transfected with siLOXL2 or siNC and incubated with Ang
  II for 48 hr. A: Western blot was performed and shows the representative bands.
  siTNC significantly attenuates the Ang II-induced increase in B: TGF-β1, C: p-Smad3,
  and D: p-NF-κB, but does not change the E: NF-κB protein level. β-actin served as
  a loading control. RT-qPCR is performed to detect the mRNA levels of F: IL-1β and
  G: TNF-α in H9c2 cells. ELISA was performed to detect the secreted H: IL-1β and
  I: TNF-α in the cell supernatant of H9c2 cells. ***P<0.001 vs cardiomyocytes in
  the control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs cardiomyocytes with Ang II'
