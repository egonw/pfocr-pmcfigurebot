caption: Periplocin increases autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer tumors
  in vivo. (a) TUNEL staining of CFPAC1 tumor sections following various treatments,
  scale bar = 100 μm. (b) Immunohistochemistry staining for LC3B in tumors in vivo,
  scale bar = 20 μm (400x). (c) Expression of cleaved-caspase3 and LC3BII/I in the
  CFPAC1 tumor model as detected by Western blotting following different treatments.
