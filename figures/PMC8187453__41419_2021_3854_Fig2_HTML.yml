figure_title: Schematic presentation of noncoding RNAs which participate in drug resistance
  of prostate cancer
caption: A summary diagram of noncoding RNAs participated in the drug resistance of
  prostate cancer. Several miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs have been found to participate
  in drug resistance by influencing RTK pathway related genes, apotptosis, AR-v7 and
  histone modification.
