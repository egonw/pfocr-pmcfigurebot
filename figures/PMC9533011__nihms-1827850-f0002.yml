figure_title: PDAC cell-intrinsic GOT2 suppresses T cell-dependent immunologic control
  of tumour growth
caption: '(A) Metascape pathway analysis depicting the top transcriptional programs
  inversely correlated with GOT2 expression in human PDAC. (B,C) Immunohistochemical
  staining of control and sgGot2 688M tumours for T cell marker CD3 (B) and subtype
  markers CD4 and CD8 (C). Representative images are shown on the left (scale bar
  = 50 μm), with quantification on the right (Ctrl: n = 5, sgGot2 a: n = 4, sgGot2
  b: n = 4). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  by one-way ANOVA. (D) Immunohistochemical staining of control and shGot2 FC1245
  tumours for T cell markers CD3 and CD8. Representative images are shown on the left
  (scale bar = 50 μm), with quantification on the right (Ctrl: n = 5, shGot2 a: n
  = 5, shGot2 b: n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  by one-way ANOVA. (E) Immunohistochemical co-staining of control and sgGot2 or shGot2
  PDAC for macrophage marker F4/80 and immunosuppressive factor arginase-1. Representative
  images are from 688M tumours (scale bar on 20X images = 10 μm, scale bar on 63X
  images = 5 μm). Quantification of double-positive cells out of total F4/80+ cells
  in the 688M and FC1245 models is on the right; data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.
  ****p < 0.0001 by unpaired t-test. (F) Multiplex immunohistochemical staining of
  control and sgGot2 FC1245 tumours for the indicated markers (large images, scale
  bar = 50 μm; insets, scale bar = 20 μm). (G) Quantification of CD3 immunohistochemistry
  on 688M PDAC at the indicated time points post-transplantation (Ctrl d11: n = 7,
  sgGot2 d11: n = 6, Ctrl d19: n = 3, sgGot2 d19: n = 3, Ctrl d27: n = 5, sgGot2 d27:
  n = 4). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by unpaired t-test. (H) PDAC tumour weight at experimental
  endpoint, 27 days after orthotopic transplantation of 688M cells and treatment with
  isotype control or T cell depleting antibodies (details in ). Ctrl: n = 5 per cohort,
  sgGot2: n = 4 per cohort. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. ****p < 0.0001 by
  one-way ANOVA.'
