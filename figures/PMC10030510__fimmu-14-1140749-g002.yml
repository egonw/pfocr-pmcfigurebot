caption: Cellular metabolism networks. (A) Glucose is imported from the extracellular
  environment and can either be converted to glycogen or oxidized during glycolysis
  to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate produced by glycolysis can be
  partially oxidized to lactate to quickly regenerate the consumed nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NADH), or it can be translocated into the mitochondria and completely
  oxidized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle can also be powered
  by fatty acids through fatty acid oxidation or glutamine through glutaminolysis.
  Electrons released by glycolysis and the TCA cycle enter the electron transport
  chain, which is made up of complex I-V (CI-CV), where ATP is produced through oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). (B) Acetyl-CoA from pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in mitochondria.
  Reactions in the cycle produce NADH and FADH, which act as substrates for the electron
  transport chain (ETC) and thus support OXPHOS and ATP production. Figure 2 was created
