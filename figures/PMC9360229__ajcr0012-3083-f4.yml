caption: Co-treatment downregulates PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. A. MDA-MB 231
  cells were treated with palbociclib and/or lidocaine for 36 h, and the levels of
  phosphorylated kinases were analyzed using a phospho-kinase array. B. Cell lysates
  were analyzed by western blotting for AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), GSK3β, p-GSK3β (Ser9),
  and β-actin.
