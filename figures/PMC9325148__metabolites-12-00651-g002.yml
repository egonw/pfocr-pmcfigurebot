caption: Intracellular signaling triggered by SUCNR1. Depending on the context, SUCNR1
  signals lead to either the activation or inhibition of the adenylate cycle (AC),
  regulating the levels of cyclic adenosyl monophosphate (cAMP). In turn, this metabolite
  regulates the activity of PKA, leading to the activation of the cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) and the caspase-3 cell death pathway. SUCNR1 activation also regulates
  the activity of PLC, able to cleave the Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  into diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3 at the plasma membrane. DAG is then capable of
  activating the protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequent activation of ERK1/2. Together
  these actors participate in the induction of mitochondrial fission through phosphorylation
  of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and the recruitment of the dynamin-related
  protein 1 (DRP1). IP3 triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). This Ca2+ increase can favorize the activation of PKC, activate
  the nitric oxide (NO) production by the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
  and activate the kinase activity CAMKII. This kinase can activate the CREB transcription
  factor controlling the expression of genes encoding the cyclooxygenases 1 and 2
  (COX1/2), among others. These enzymes then produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Figure
