caption: Correlation analysis of serum (general immunity), stool (intestinal immunity)
  cytokine levels, functional data (metabolic pathway), and taxonomic features abundance
  in Cntrl-M and long-lived (LL) groups. a Between functional and taxonomic data in
  Cntrl-M (left) and LL (right) groups. b Between functional data and general immunity
  in LL group. c Between functional data and intestinal immunity in LL group. Positive
  correlations are shown in red, negative correlations in blue. Spearman r, FDR, p
  ≤ 0.5. p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.
