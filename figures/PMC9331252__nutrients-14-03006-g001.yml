caption: 'Effect of mulberry leaf extract (MLE) and neochlorogenic acid (nCGA) treatment
  on cell viability/proliferation. (A) A7r5 cell proliferation after being induced
  by HG (25 mM) and Oleic acid (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mM) for 24 and 48 h. (B,C) A7r5
  cells were treated with indicated concentrations of MLE (1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10, and
  20 mg/mL) and nCGA (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 μM) for 24 h. (D,E) A7r5 cells
  were pretreated with OH and then exposed to different concentrations of MLE (0.0,
  1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/mL) and nCGA (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 μM) for 24 h. Cell
  viability/proliferation of the A7r5 cells was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5
  diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The quantitative data are presented as
  the mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent experiments. # p < 0.05 as compared
  to the C (control). * p < 0.05 as compared to OH group.'
