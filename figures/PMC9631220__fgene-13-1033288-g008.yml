caption: Histochemical staining and fluorometric assay of VvPR1 in response to ABA.
  (A) Histochemical staining analysis; GUS activity in transiently transformed N.
  benthamiana leaves with serially deleted VvPR1 promoter fragments (−1,837, −1,443,
  −1,119, −845, −558, −436, and −192) bp against ABA. (B) Fluorometric assay of VvPR1
  promoter fragments (−1,837, −1,443, −1,119, −845, −558, −436, and −192) bp in response
  to SA in tobacco leaves through transient expression. Different letters on the bars
  showed a significant difference between the SA-treated promoter fragments and the
  control according to the least significant difference (LSD) test (p < 0.05).
