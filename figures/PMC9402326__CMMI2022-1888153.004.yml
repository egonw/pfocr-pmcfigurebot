caption: 'Effects of lidocaine on the expressions of the c-Jun signaling pathway in
  DPN rats: (a) the mRNA expressions of the c-Jun signaling pathway in serum from
  different groups are determined by qRT-PCR analysis; (b) the protein expressions
  of the c-Jun signaling pathway in serum from different groups are determined by
  western blot analysis; (c) the mRNA expressions of the c-Jun signaling pathway in
  DRGs from different groups are determined by qRT-PCR analysis; (d) the protein expressions
  of the c-Jun signaling pathway in DRGs from different groups are determined by western
  blot analysis.'
