caption: Survivin is a target of post-transcription repression by miR-494 in TNBC
  cells. (A) Survivin mRNA expression level was increased in hypoxic TNBC cells by
  qPCR; and (B) Survivin protein expression level was increased in hypoxic TNBC cells
  by WB; (C) Hsa-miR-494 was the intersection miRNA of miRDB, miRWalk and TargetScan
  databases targeted Survivin. (D) The wild-type and mutant variant of the putative
  miR-494 target sequences of the Survivin gene. (E) Two copies of the wild-type and
  mutant miR-494 target sequences were fused with a luciferase reporter and transfected
  into control oligonucleotide and miR-494 mimics infected HEK293T cells. MiR-494
  significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of the wild-type Survivin 3’UTR.
  Survivin protein expression level was found regulated directly by miR-494, as reflected
  by the decreased Survivin expression in hypoxic TNBC cells after transient transfection
  of miR-494 mimic, and increased Survivin expression in normoxic TNBC cells after
  miR-494 inhibitor transfection via (F) WB, or (G) Immunofluorescence. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
