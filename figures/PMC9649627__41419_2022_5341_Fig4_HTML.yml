figure_title: The AMPK-ATG13/ULK1 axis plays a role in ML-323-induced autophagy
caption: 'A Immunofluorescence staining of the autophagic marker LC3B. HCCLM3 and
  SMMC-7721 cells were treated with ML-323 for 24 h and then incubated with LC3B primary
  antibody (1:200, 4 °C overnight) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)
  secondary antibody (green) (1:500, 2 h at 25 °C), respectively. DAPI staining (blue)
  (5 μg/mL, 25 °C, 20 min). Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope.
  Representative images are shown. B Electron microscopic images showing the accumulation
  of autophagosomes in ML-323-treated HCC cells. ASS represent autophagosomes. (M:
  Mitochondrion, RER: Rough endoplasmic reticulum, Go: Golgi apparatus, LD: Lipid
  droplets). C Western blot analysis of LC3B expression levels in HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721
  cells. D Western blot analysis of proteins related to the AMPK-ULK1-ATG13 signaling
  pathway in ML-323-treated HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells. ML-323 activates the AMPK-ULK1-ATG13
  signaling pathway. E Western blot analysis showing the effect of co-treatment with
  siRNA control, siAMPK, and ML-323 on protein expression. The HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721
  cells were treated with ML-323 alone or in combination with siRNA control or siAMPK.
  F Annexin V-FITC /PI double-staining of AMPK-deficient HCC cells. After transfection
  with siControl or siAMPK, HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with ML-323 for
  48 h. G LC3B immunofluorescent staining of AMPL-deficient HCC cells shows that blocking
  AMPK reduced ML-323-induced autophagy. HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with
  ML-323 alone or in combination with siRNA or siAMPK. Data represent at least three
  independent experiments (n = 3; error bars, SD).'
