caption: The expression of circ_000166 in the kidney tissue of diabetic renal fibrosis
  model mice is increased. At 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, (a) blood sugar level, (b)
  weight, (c) the ratio of kidney-to-body weight, and (d) urine protein levels of
  the normal control group and T1DM group mice were measured. (e) The expression levels
  of circ_000166 in the kidney tissues of the two groups of mice were detected by
  qRT-PCR, and (f, g) the expression levels of collagen IV in the kidney tissues of
  the two groups of mice were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. The data are expressed
  as mean ± standard (control group (n = 7), DN group (n = 7)). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
