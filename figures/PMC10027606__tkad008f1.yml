caption: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the NF-κB pathway in septic acute kidney
  injury (AKI). RANK-derived canonical NF-κB pathways are outlined, and the K63-Ub
  chain generated by TRAF6 serves as a substrate for the formation of a signal complex
  that includes TAK1/TAB2, IKKα/IKKβ/NEMO (the regulatory subunit IKKγ). NF-κB, which
  is made up of the NF-κB dimers (p50/p65) and another inhibitory subunit IκB (IκBα
  has been the most studied). The IκBa kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two
  catalytically active kinases, IKKα and IKKβ and NEMO, catalyzes the stimulus-induced
  degradation of IκBα proteins. Phosphorylated IκBa is ubiquitinated by K48 poly-Ub
  and degraded by proteasomes, causing NF-κB to rapidly activate, allowing bound NF-κB
  dimers to translocate to the nucleus and bind to multiple gene promoters, regulating
  various pathogenic processes. miRNAs have a role in the pathology of septic AKI
  via modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway
