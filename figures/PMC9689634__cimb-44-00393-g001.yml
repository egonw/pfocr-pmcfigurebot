caption: Key metabolic genes and lipid processing genes regulated by adenovirus-mediated
  overexpression of RIP140 in a dose-dependent manner. (A) RIP140 and PGC-1α expression
  detected by Western blot analysis after Ad-RIP140 infection. (B) Results of real-time
  RT-PCR analysis for transcriptional regulators in RPE cells infected with Ad-RIP140
  (C,D) Expression of metabolic genes associated with glucose and fatty acid metabolism
  at mRNA levels in the presence of different expression of RIP140. (E) Lipid processing
  genes altered in RIP140 groups. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. Ad-GFP
  group.
