caption: 'Pygo1 expression was upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer. (a) Kaplan-Meier
  overall survival (OS) curves according to Pygo1 expression levels in database analyzed
  by Kaplan-Meier Plotter (nlow = 976, nhigh = 949). (b) Pygo1 protein levels in NSCLC
  tissues (LC) of different pathological grades and adjacent tissues (AD) were detected
  by western blotting. (c) Protein expression levels were quantified and analyzed
  by ImageJ and GraphPad Prism software, respectively. The results shown are representative
  of independent experiments. (d) Quantitative analysis of IHC images using ImageJ.
  (e) Representative images from immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays of NSCLC of different
  pathological grades and adjacent tissues. Grade I, grade II, and grade III refer
  to WHO-IA-LUAD, WHO-IIA-LUAD, and WHO-IIIB-LUSC, respectively. Scale bar: 100 μm.
