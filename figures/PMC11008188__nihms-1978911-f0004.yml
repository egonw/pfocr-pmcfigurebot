figure_title: NetBID2 analyses identified the B cell developmental drivers as the
  L-asparaginase response drivers in B-ALL
caption: '(A) L-asparaginase LC50 distribution in B-ALL (L-asparaginase pharmacotyping
  cohort, n = 203). Blue: extremely sensitive cases (samples whose LC50 was lower
  than the lowest asparaginase concentration, LC50 defined as 0.0016 IU/mL). Red:
  extremely resistant case (samples whose LC50 was higher than the highest asparaginase
  concentration, LC50 defined as 20 IU/mL).(B) Schematic workflow of SJARACNe and
  NetBID2 algorithm to generate B-ALL subtypes-specific networks and driver activity
  matrix of the L-asparaginase pharmacotyping cohort.(C) Pathway analysis of driver
  genes associated with L-asparaginase response. The top 200 L-asparaginase-resistant
  and top 200 L-asparaginase-sensitive drivers were identified using NetBID2. Fisher’s
  exact test was used to assess overrepresentation of each gene set in the HALLMARK
  database and curated gene set: B_progenitor_drivers and B_dev_drivers in drug-response
  drivers. Curated gene sets were the top differentially upregulated drivers of B
  cell development states in NetBID2 analysis of BM samples from eight healthy donors
  in Human Cell Atlas Census of Immune Cells study. Bubble plot was colored by −log10
  (p value) from red (low p value) to blue (high p value).(D) Heatmap of NetBID-inferred
  activity of 13 drug-response driver genes in the L-asparaginase pharmacotyping cohort
  (33 sensitive cases and 45 resistant cases). To identify the left part of the panel,
  the 400 drivers associated with ex vivo L-asparaginase response were filtered against
  the genes in the pathway: B_progenitor_drivers. The top rows show genes associated
  with L-asparaginase resistance, whereas the bottom rows represent genes driving
  L-asparaginase sensitivity. The heatmap on the right shows the NetBID-inferred activity
  of these drug-response driver genes from the scRNA-seq profile of human BM B cell
  development states. 500 cells from each B cell development state were randomly selected
  for visualization.(E) Boxplot showing the B cell development state composition in
  L-asparaginase-resistant B-ALL vs. L-asparaginase-sensitive B-ALL. The p values
  were estimated using a two-sided Student’s t test and were adjusted using the Bonferroni
  method (P.adj). The percentage of the developmental cell types in bulk RNA-seq samples
  of L-asparaginase pharmacotyping B-ALL was inferred from CIBERSORTx. Also see –.'
