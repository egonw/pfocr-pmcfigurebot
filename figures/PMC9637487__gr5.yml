caption: Conserved networks regulating axillary meristem conversion in panicles of
  maize and rice. The inflorescence branching pattern is determined by meristem size,
  bud initiation, and outgrowth. The upper and lower panels show the conserved or
  stage-specific regulators that affect meristem transition in maize and rice, respectively;
  and the details are provided in the text. The miR156/SPLs network regulating BM-SM
  formation, and the miR172 targeting ethylene response factors IDS1 or IDS1 and SID1
  or SNB pathway are highly conserved in maize and rice. However, OsFD1/14â€“3-3-centered
  florigen activation complex or florigen repression complex determining the vegetative-to-reproductive
  transition and RAMOSA pathway controlling SPM-SM conversion are specific in maize
  and rice. Importantly, auxins, transported basipetally inhibit the outgrowth of
  axillary buds, while cytokinins (CKs) and strigolactones (SLs) transported in the
  opposite direction, promote and limit the outgrowth by mitigating polar auxin transport
  in AMs, respectively. Genes mentioned above are also listed in Supplementary .
