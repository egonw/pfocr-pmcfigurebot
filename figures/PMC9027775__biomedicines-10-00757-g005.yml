caption: Integrative pathway enrichment analysis in p65-DsRed/IκBα-eGFP BMDMs. The
  enrichment map and data table indicate the top 5 prognostic signalling pathways
  identified using all 363 differentially expressed genes identified in unstimulated
  and Lipid A-stimulated (100 ng/mL, at 1, 3 and 6 h) p65-DsRedxp/IκBα-eGFP BMDMs.
  Interactions are indicated by connecting lines and multi-coloured nodes indicate
  pathways that were prognostic according to several types of molecular evidence.
  Data outputs were generated using the inBio Discover™ tool (www.inbio-discover.com/
  (accessed on 16 January 2022)) and no relevance score cut-off was used.
