caption: M2-CM increased the TMZ resistance in the GBM cells by regulating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2
  pathway. (a, b) The apoptotic cell ratio in the GBM cells was determined by performing
  the FCM assay. (c, d) The MTT assay was employed to determine cell proliferation
  in the GBM cells. Each experiment repeated at least 3 times, and âˆ—P < 0.05.
