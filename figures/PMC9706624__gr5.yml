caption: Metabolome analysis of cecum in the HC and HPⅢ groups. (A) Analysis of differential
  metabolite expression between the HC and HPⅢ groups. Red indicates the increase
  in metabolite content; blue indicates the decrease in metabolite content; and gray
  indicates no significant difference. (B) Pathway enrichment of differentially expressed
  metabolites was analyzed using the pathway enrichment statistical scatterplot. (C)
  Classification of differential metabolites in the HMDB database.
article_title: Transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal the regulatory effects
  of compound probiotics on cecal metabolism in heat-stressed broilers.
