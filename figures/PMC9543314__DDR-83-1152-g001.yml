caption: Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) induces pyroptotic cell death via
  the ROS/PI3K/AKT pathway in HCT116 cells. (a) HCT116 cells treated with SDG in the
  presence or absence of NAC, intracellular ROS content was measured with flow cytometry.
  (b) and (c) HCT116 cells treated with SDG in the presence or absence of NAC, cell
  viability and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured. (d) and (e) HCT116
  cells treated with SDG in the presence or absence of NAC, after treatment, cell
  protein was then harvested to detect BAX, cleaved caspase‐1, cleaved GSDMD, PI3K/AKT,
  and GAPDH by western blot. All the data are presented as the mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. *p  <  .05, **p < .01 versus control. SD, standard deviation.
