caption: Mitochondrial Ca2+signaling in TNBC cells regulates acyl-carnitine metabolism.
  (A) Traces represent mean OCR in MDA-MB-231 CTRL cells treated as indicated (OA
  = Oligomycin-A (1 µM); Rot. = Rotenone (1 µM); AA = Antimycin-A (1 µM); FCCP (1 µM)).
  U-73343 is an inactive analog of U-73122, used as control for this latter treatment.
  On the right, bars represent the ATP-linked and maximal OCR for each specific condition.
  Mean ± SEM. n = 9–15 wells from 3 independent experiments. OCR was normalized for
  cell number and for the basal OCR of the DMSO condition. (B) Representative traces
  of nuclear and mitochondrial ATP level variations (expressed as YFP/CFP FRET R)
  in the indicated cell types expressing nuclear and mitochondrial ATeam1.03 probes,
  upon inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by Rotenone (1 µM) + Antimycin-A (1 µM)
  (arrows). Bars represent the corresponding quantification, for each condition, of
  Δ FRET R after 10 min from Rot + AA addition. n = 18–23 cells from 3 independent
  experiments. (C) Bars represent the relative levels of ATP and lactate (normalized
  to those measured in MDA-MB-231 CTRL cells), or the ATP energy charge (see Materials
  and Methods) in the indicated cell types. Mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments.
  (D) The scores plot shows the Principal Component Analysis to represent the distribution
  of the MDA-MB-231 CTRL and MDA-MB-231 MCU-KO cell group. n = 3 independent experiments/group.
  (E) Volcano plot of significantly increased (blue dots) and reduced (red dots) metabolites,
  mostly linked to acyl-carnitine pathway, in MDA-MB-231 MCU-KO cells, compared to
  MDA-MB-231 CTRL. Statistically significant metabolites were identified by Student’s
  t-test (log2FC≠0; -log10pval >1.3). n = 3 independent experiments. (F) Heatmap of
  the top 50 metabolites detected by mass spectrometry displaying the largest differences
  between MDA-MB-231 CTRL and MDA-MB-231 MCU-KO cells. Statistically significant metabolites
  were identified by Student’s t-test. (G) Bars represent the ratio between (C18:0
  + C16:0)-acyl-carnitine and free-carnitine (C0) in the indicated cell types. Mean
  ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments. (H) Bars represent the levels of glycerol
  (normalized to MDA-MB-231 CTRL cells) released in the growth medium of the indicated
  cell types. Mean ± SEM. n = 5-8 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001.
