caption: Depletion of chromodomain helicase DNA‐binding protein 7 (CHD7) activates
  the p53 signalling pathway. (A) The mRNAs from cells expressing control short hairpin
  RNAs (shRNA) or CHD7 shRNA‐2 were extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq).
  At the significance of q < 0.05 and with foldchange ≥1.5, the number of dysregulated
  genes are shown. (B) Volcano plot shows the differentially expressed genes between
  RKO cells expressing control shRNAs and CHD7 shRNA‐2. At the significance of q < 0.05
  and with foldchange ≥1.5, significantly upregulated genes are shown as red dots,
  and downregulated as blue dots. (C) Heat maps show the expression of significantly
  dysregulated genes. (D) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of significantly
  dysregulated genes in CHD7 knockdown RKO cells. (E) Hallmark enrichment analyses
  of dysregulated genes in CHD7 knockdown RKO cells. (F) Total mRNA from RKO cells
  expressing indicated shRNAs was extracted and quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR assays
  were performed. Each bar represents the mean ± SD for n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 versus control (Student's t test). (G) Quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR
  assays were performed using primers targeting p53. Each bar represents the mean ± SD
  for n = 3, ***P < 0.001 versus control (Student's t test). (H) Western blot analysis
  of the expression of p53, CDKN1A, TP53BP1, and β‐actin in RKO and HCT116 cells expressing
  control or CHD7 shRNAs. (I) RKO and HCT116 cells expressing control shRNA or CHD7
  shRNA‐2 were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) (50 mg/ml) for 0, 30, 60, 90, 120,
  and 150 min, and then cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting
