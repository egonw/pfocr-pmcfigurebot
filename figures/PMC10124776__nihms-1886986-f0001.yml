caption: 'Genetic modifications designed to address mechanisms of xenograft injury:
  Examples of genetic modifications designed to prevent known xenograft injury (top)
  include Gal a 1-3Gal and 2 other carbohydrates (triple knockout, TKO) and expression
  of human complement pathway regulatory proteins (hCPRPs) and coagulation pathway
  regulatory proteins, eg, thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor (bottom).
  Absence of carbohydrate antigens and expression of human complement and coagulation
  pathway regulatory molecules reduce endothelial activation and injury.'
