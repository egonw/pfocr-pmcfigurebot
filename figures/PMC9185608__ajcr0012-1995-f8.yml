caption: Representative results of functional enrichment analysis via GO, KEGG, and
  GSEA. (A-D) The 39 differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes were mainly
  enriched in pathways based on the biological process (A), cellular component (B),
  molecular function (C) and KEGG pathway (D). (E) Protein-protein interaction network
  showed the interactions between these 39 ferroptosis-related genes. (F, G) The signaling
  pathways in which genes of the high-risk score (F) and low-risk score patients (G)
  were significantly enriched in the GSEA.

  recurrence after hepatectomy of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
