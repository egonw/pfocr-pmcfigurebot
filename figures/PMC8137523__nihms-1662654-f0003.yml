figure_title: Novel insights uncover diverse mechanisms driving mevalonate pathway
  dependence
caption: Cholesterol may support early premalignant cell signaling, while strong evidence
  bolsters a role for protein prenylation in macropinocytosis. The cancer stem cell
  dependence on mevalonate pathway intermediates is mechanistically tied to a feedforward
  loop that promotes MYC expression and cancer stem cell maintenance. This feedforward
  loop can be disrupted by statin treatment. Lastly, the mesenchymal state has demonstrated
  a unique sensitivity to statins in various cancer models.
