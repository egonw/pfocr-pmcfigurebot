caption: The activity profiles of multiple mitochondrial complex assemblies, metabolic
  and molecular pathways were significantly changed in the CD4IL2RALO Tregs by Mito‐ATO
  treatment. A) Downregulated genesets in Tregs upon Mito‐ATO treatment using GO analysis.
  B) Upregulated ogenesets in Tregs upon Mito‐ATO treatment using GO analysis. C)
  Comparison of mitochondrial complex and metabolic pathway activities between the
  control and Mito‐ATO treatment groups in the CD4IL2RAHI Tregs. D) Comparison of
  mitochondrial complex and metabolic pathway activities between the control and Mito‐ATO
  treatment groups in the CD4IL2RALO Tregs. Three types of mitochondrial complexes,
  i.e., Complex I, III, and IV of CD4IL2RALO Tregs, were all significantly inhibited
  by Mito‐ATO treatment. Two main metabolic pathways—OXPHOS and glycolysis activities—were
  both significantly downregulated in the Mito‐ATO group compared with the control
  group. Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species pathway activities were upregulated
  in the Mito‐ATO group.
