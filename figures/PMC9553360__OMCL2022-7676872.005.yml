caption: Pb exposure induced a low inflammatory response in the gut and gut dysbiosis
  in mice. (a) Western blot analysis and shading analysis of gut barrier markers,
  including E-cadherin, Claudin-3, Claudin-1, ZO-2, and ZO-1 in control and high-dose
  Pb exposure groups. (b) Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained colon
  sections from control and high dose Pb exposure groups. (c) Representative images
  of HE stained jejunum sections from control and high dose Pb exposure groups. (d)
  Shannon diversity index of gut microbiota in the three groups. (e) PCOA analysis
  of gut microbiota in the three groups. ∗P < 0.05.∗∗P < 0.01.
