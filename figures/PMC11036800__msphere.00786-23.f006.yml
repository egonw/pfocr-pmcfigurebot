caption: Impact of metabolic mutants in acute and chronic invertebrate infection models.
  (A) Survival curves of wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) subjected to acute
  hemolymph infection with PA14, ΔglpK, or Δedd strains as indicated. Heat-killed
  PA14 was used as a control. Asterisk indicates significantly different survival
  vs PA14. (B) Survival curves of nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) subjected to
  gut biofilm infection with the indicated strains. Escherichia coli OP50 was used
  as a non-infecting control. Graphs represent combined experimental results for animals
  fed on the indicated strains prior to shifting. Days are reported post-infection.
  Asterisk indicates significantly different survival vs PA14 (P < 0.05). Data in
  panels A and B are presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Statistical significance
  was estimated by the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. (C) Representative plots of immune
  responses in C. elegans animals infected with the indicated strains as assessed
  by fluorescence intensity of a HIF-1-responsive reporter. The mean and SEM are shown
  with the individual values. Significance in gray is vs OP50. ++P < 0.0001 and ns,
  not significant. Significance in black is vs PA14. **P < 0.0001.
