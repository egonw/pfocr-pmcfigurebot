caption: The effect of CORM-3 on TSCC cell proliferation. (a) CAL27 or SCC4 cells
  were incubated with 0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μM CORM-3, respectively, for 24 h.
  Cell proliferation was assessed by a CCK-8 kit. (b, c) CORM-3 of 0, 200, 400, and
  800 μM was applied to CAL27 and SCC4 cells, respectively. Cell proliferation was
  measured at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment with CCK-8. (d) CAL27 or SCC4
  cells were incubated with 400 μM CORM-3 and iCORM-3 for 24 h. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 vs. the control group, respectively.
