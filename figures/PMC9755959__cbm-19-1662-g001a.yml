caption: RAB31 is upregulated in GC and predicts poor prognosis. (A) Expression of
  RAB31 mRNA in different tumor types including gastric cancer (GC) and corresponding
  normal tissues, according to GEPIA and TCGA database analysis. (B, C) mRNA and protein
  expression of RAB31 in 7 GC cell lines and GES-1 cells. (D, E) Relative RAB31 mRNA
  expression in 30 pairs of GC and adjacent normal tissues. (F-H) RAB31 protein expression
  and immunohistochemical staining in representative patients with GC (patient 1 and
  patient 10). (I-K) Survival analysis via the K-M Plotter online database (scale
  bar = 200 Î¼m, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns = no significance).
article_title: MiR-378a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer via directly
  targeting RAB31 and inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway proteins GLI1/2.
