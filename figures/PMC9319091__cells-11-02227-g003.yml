caption: 'VMP1 regulates the proliferation of goat myoblasts: (A,B) RT-qPCR was used
  to determine VMP1 expression levels in myoblasts transfected with pcDNA3.1-VMP1
  and siRNA-VMP1. (C) Proliferation of goat myoblasts overexpressing VMP1, measured
  using a Cell Counting Kit-8. (D) Proliferation of goat myoblasts transfected with
  siRNA-VMP1. (E) Expression of the cell-proliferation-related genes CDK4, cyclin
  D1, and cyclin D2 in cells overexpressing VMP1 was determined by RT-qPCR. (F) Expression
  of cell-proliferation-related genes in cells transfected with siRNA-VMP1. (G) EdU
  staining of myoblasts overexpressing VMP1, and in which VMP1 is silenced. (H,I)
  Fold change in the proliferation of myoblasts overexpressing VMP1, and in which
  VMP1 is silenced. Replicates = 3. Data are shown as the mean Â± SE. * p < 0.05 and
  ** p < 0.01. NC, negative control.'
