caption: The bioinformatics analysis of the DEGs in PCa. (a, b) The increased expression
  of genes was related with the modulation of mitotic nuclear division, sister chromatid
  cohesion, cell division, tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation, translation,
  Metabolic pathways, N-Glycan biosynthesis, RNA transport, biosynthesis of antibiotics,
  and cell cycle. (c, d) The downregulated genes were involved in regulating extracellular
  matrix organization, angiogenesis, signal transduction, heart development, cell
  adhesion, positive regulation of GTPase activity, axon guidance, regulation of transcription,
  Focal adhesion, pathways in cancer, Proteoglycans in cancer, and Ras signaling pathway.
