caption: The expected metabolic pathway of PTB and TB in the vagina. (A) schematic
  representation of PTB and TB in a vagina, (B) comparison of the metabolic pathway
  between the environment of Lactobacillus dominance and bacterial vaginosis. The
  asterisks denote the selected biomarkers. Vaginal mucus acts as a chemical barrier
  to infection and as a primary defense in maintaining aerobiosis. The blue arrow
  is the metabolic direction when Lactobacillus dominates, and the red arrow is the
  metabolic direction in the BV environment. Glucose is a precursor of creatinine,
  glycine, and serine, while glutamic acid is a precursor of proline. Thus, it can
  be confirmed that PTB and TB have significant differences in the metabolism of carbohydrates,
  amino acids, nucleotides, and energy (p < 0.05).
