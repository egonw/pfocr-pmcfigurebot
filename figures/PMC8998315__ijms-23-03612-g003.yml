caption: Relationship between iron and Alzheimer’s disease/Parkinson’s disease. Fe3+
  can be absorbed and utilized by astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia
  in the brain. When the iron-related proteins change in neurons, the iron homeostasis
  is disturbed, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. Upregulation of some iron-storage
  proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin increased expression of DMT1 in dopamine
  neurons. Both ceruloplasmin dysfunction and a decreased level of neuromelanin can
  cause an accelerated onset of Parkinson’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized
  by the formation of Aβ plaques and NFTs in the brain. The increase of intracellular
  iron level promotes β-secretase and γ-secretase activities to enhance the amyloid
  production pathway, and finally causes Aβ aggregation around microglia. In addition,
  iron also binds to tau, affecting its phosphorylation and inducing hyperphosphorylated
  tau tangles in neurons. Aβ aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles together lead
  to the occurrence of AD. Apo-Tf, Apo-transferrin; Holo-Tf, Holo-transferrin; BVECs,
