caption: Levels of MIF and SLC3A2 expression in colorectal cancer cells were higher
  than those in normal intestinal epithelial cells. (A) MIF mRNA expression in NCM460,
  FHC, SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT‐29 and LoVo cells. (B) SLC3A2 mRNA expression in NCM460,
  FHC, SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT‐29 and LoVo cells. (C) MIF protein expression in NCM460,
  FHC, SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT‐29 and LoVo cells. (D) SLC3A2 protein expression in
  NCM460, FHC, SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT‐29 and LoVo cells. (E) Western blotting was
  performed to confirm the levels of MIF and SLC3A2 protein expression in NCM460,
  FHC, SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT‐29 and LoVo cells. ‘*’ means p < 0.05 when compared
  with the NCM460 or FHC group; ‘**’ means p < 0.01 when compared with the NCM460
  or FHC group; ‘***’ means p < 0.001 when compared with the NCM460 or FHC group.
  GAPDH served as an invariant internal control for calculating fold changes in protein
  expression
