caption: 'The expression and characteristics of hsa_circ_0006943. A Volcano map of
  circRNA high-throughput sequencing of 3 cases of PTC with extensive lymph node metastasis
  in the neck versus 3 cases of PTC without extensive lymph node metastasis. B Schematic
  diagram of the formation structure of circNDST1. C sanger sequencing to identify
  circNDST1 back-splicing site. D The expression of circNDST1 in normal thyroid epithelial
  cells and PTC cell lines. E Rnase R resistance of circNDST1 and its linear molecule
  NDST1. F After treatment of TPC1 cells with actinomycin D, the levels of circNDST1
  and linear molecule NDST1 were detected by RT-qPCR at different treatment times.
  G PCR amplification of cDNA and gDNA in GAPDH, circNDST1,NDST1 and subsequent agarose
  gel electrophoresis. H Nucleoplasmic separation was used to detect circNDST1 localization,
  where U6 was used as a cytosolic reference and GAPDH as a cytoplasmic reference.
  I FISH detection of the localization of circNDST1 (scale bar: 50 μm). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Data are shown as SD ± mean'
article_title: CircNDST1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer progression via its interaction
  with CSNK2A1 to activate the PI3K–Akt pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
