caption: Effects of carambolaside W on intracellular protein signaling pathway expression.
  (A) Western blot detection of PARP, Bcl-XL, and STAT-3 protein expression. (B) Carambolaside
  W was involved in the changes in the apoptotic signaling pathway in H1N1-infected
  MDCK cells, and its main effects were the mitochondria-related signaling proteins
  Bcl-XL and PARP and the cytokine-stimulation-related protein STAT-3. The concentration
  of carambolaside W used here is 32 Î¼M.

  through STAT-3/BCL-XL Signaling Pathway.
