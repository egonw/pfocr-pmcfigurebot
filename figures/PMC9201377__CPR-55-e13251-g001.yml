caption: MT/CREB/ATG3 pathway is responsible for melatonin‐repressed apoptosis in
  HCAECs, in an autophagy‐dependent manner. (A) Cell proliferation of HCAECs, with
  or without ATG3 knockdown, as assessed using CCK‐8 assay. (B) Cell apoptosis of
  HCAECs, with or without ATG3 knockdown, was examined by means of Annexin V‐FITC/PI
  double‐staining and flow cytometry. Cell percentages in the Q3 and Q2 quadrants
  (indicating the fraction of apoptotic cells) were calculated, and are presented
  as histograms. (C) Relative expression of ATG3, MMP‐9, E‐selectin, VCAM‐1, and ICAM‐1
  after ATG3‐knockdown in HCAECs, as analysed using RT‐qPCR. (D) Western blot showing
  the expression of Bcl‐2 in ATG3‐deficient HCAECs. (E) Kinetics of autophagic flux
  was detected using a fluorescence microscope, after the HCAECs were infected with
  an adenoviral vector expressing mRFP‐GFP‐LC3. (F) Cell proliferation of HCAECs was
  assessed using CCK‐8 assay. Mel, melatonin group (melatonin, 0.5 mM, 6 h); si‐ATG3+Mel,
  melatonin treatment after silencing of ATG3; NC, negative control. (G) Cell apoptosis
  of HCAECs, as assessed using flow cytometry. (H) Relative expression of ATG3 in
  the presence of CREB inhibitor, as analysed using RT‐qPCR. BCL2 served as a positive
  reference. (I) ATG3 promoter sequence with CREB binding site. (J) Luciferase activity
  of 293 T cells co‐transfected with CREB‐CDS vector or vector carrying ATG3 promoter
  sequence, or co‐transfected with CREB‐CDS vector and blank vector without ATG3 promoter
  sequence. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001;
  ns, not significant. ATG3, autophagy‐related gene‐3; CDS, coding sequence; CREB,
  cAMP‐response element binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ICAM‐1, intercellular
  cell adhesion molecule‐1; MMP‐9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; mRFP, monomeric red
  fluorescent protein; MT, melatonin receptor; VCAM‐1, vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1
