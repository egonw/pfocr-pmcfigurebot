caption: Effect of freezing, anoxia, and dehydration stresses on the relative expression
  of XBP1 pathway proteins (Inac XBP1, Act XBP1, EDEM) in a liver and b skeletal muscle
  of wood frogs. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4 independent biological replicates. Statistical
  testing used one-way ANOVA and Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test with p < 0.05
  accepted as significant. *Significantly different from controls
