caption: 'TEM revealed a normal keratocyte appearance with an intact Descemet’s membrane.
  (A,B,I) Representative Toluidine Blue-Stained Semi-Thick Scout Section revealed
  a pathological thinning in the corneal stroma in Smad4kera-cko (36.55 ± 0.53 μm)
  compared to those in Smad4Ctrl (106.72 ± 0.90 μm) (n = 6, ****, p < 0.0001) and
  both the interfaces between corneal epithelium and corneal stroma are smooth. (C,D)
  TEM revealed a normal appearance in keratocytes in both Smad4Ctrl and Smad4kera-cko.
  (E–H) The Descemet’s membrane is intact and showed no defect in the Smad4kera-cko,
  neither a significant difference compared to those in Smad4Ctrl (Red dash lines).
  Abbreviations: Epi, epithelium; Str, stroma; End, endothelium; Kera, keratocyte;
  Des, Descemet’s membrane.'
