figure_title: Effects of 5/6 nephrectomy and GANT‐61 on myocardial fibrosis levels
  in Sprague‐Dawley (SD) rats. Hearts were collected 16 weeks after surgery
caption: A and B, Sirius red staining in the myocardial tissue of SD rats (n=6 rats/group,
  ***P<0.001, bar=50 μm). C and D, Real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  analysis of collagen‐1 and collagen‐3 expression in SD rat myocardial tissue (n=6
  rats/group, ***P<0.001). E through G, Immunohistochemistry in the myocardium of
  SD rats. The average optical density (OD) values of collagen‐1 and collagen‐3 in
  the myocardial tissue sections from the SD rats in the chronic kidney disease (CKD)+vehicle
  group were significantly higher than those in the SD rats from the sham group. Compared
  with the CKD+vehicle group, the average OD values of collagen‐1 and collagen‐3 in
  myocardial tissue sections from SD rats in the CKD+GANT‐61 group were decreased
  (n=6 rats/group, ***P<0.001, bar=50 μm). H through J, Immunofluorescence staining
  in the cardiac tissue of SD rats. The average fluorescence intensity of collagen‐1
  and collagen‐3 in the myocardial tissue in the rats of the CKD+vehicle group was
  higher than that in the sham group. The average fluorescence intensity of collagen‐1
  and collagen‐3 in myocardial tissue sections of SD rats in the CKD+GANT‐61 group
  was decreased compared with that in the CKD+vehicle group (n=6 rats/group, ***P<0.001,
  bar=50 μm).
