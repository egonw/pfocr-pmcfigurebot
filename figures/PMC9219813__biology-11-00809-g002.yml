caption: S1P-S1PR pathways. Extracellular S1P binds to S1P receptors. Each receptor
  binds to a different G protein and triggers downstream signaling pathways. S1PR1
  mainly binds to Gi/o, and S1PR2 binds G12/13 and Gi/o and Gq. S1PR3 binds to mostly
  Gq but also to Gi/o and G12/13. S1PR4 and S1PR5 bind to Gi/o and G12/13. Gi/o activates
  Akt, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, Rac, and PLC/PKC pathways but suppresses cAMP. Gq activates
  the PLC/PKC pathway. G12/13 activates Rho and the downstream ROCK/ROK pathway.
