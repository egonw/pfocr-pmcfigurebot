caption: The effect of GE on RPE cells in diabetic mice. (A,B) ERG was used to detect
  the changes of a-wave and b-wave light intensity-amplitude in control diabetic mice
  and diabetic mice after GE treatment; (C-E) RT-PCR was used to detect the expression
  changes of AKT, miR-4429, and JAK2 in RPE cells of control diabetic mice and diabetic
  mice after GE treatment (***P<0.01). ERG, electroretinogram; GE, genipin; RPE, retinal
  pigment epithelial; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
