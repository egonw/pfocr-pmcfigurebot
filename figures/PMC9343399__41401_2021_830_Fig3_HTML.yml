figure_title: ACY1 regulated collagen expression and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway
  in Ang II-treated MCFs
caption: 'a The expression of collagen III, collagen I, p-Smad3, and Smad3 were determined
  by Western blotting in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with ACY1-plasmid or control-plasmid
  (n = 3). b Representative immunofluorescence analysis of TGF-β1 in Ang II-induced
  MCFs treated with ACY1-plasmid or control-plasmid (n = 3). c The expression of collagen
  III, collagen I, p-Smad3, and Smad3 were determined by Western blotting in Ang II-induced
  MCFs treated with ACY1-siRNA or control-siRNA (n = 3). d Representative immunofluorescence
  analysis of TGF-β1 in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with ACY1-siRNA or control-siRNA
  (n = 3). #P < 0.05 vs. Control group without Ang II, ##P < 0.01 vs. Control group
  without Ang II, *P < 0.05 vs. group treated with Ang II alone, **P < 0.01 vs. group
  treated with Ang II alone, @P < 0.05 vs. group treated with ACY1-siRNA alone, @@P < 0.01
  vs. group treated with ACY1-siRNA alone.'
