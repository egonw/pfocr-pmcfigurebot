caption: RIP140 deficiency sensitizes cells to G6PD inhibition. (A) MTT assay in WT
  or RIPKO MEFs after 4 days of increasing doses of 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN) at 10,
  40 and 80 µM. Values are normalized to day 1 for MEF WT or RIPKO and to control
  samples expressed as 100%. (B) MTT assay in WT or RIPKO MEFs treated with 20 µM
  of 6AN. (C) Cell viability assessed by crystal violet staining of transformed WT
  or RIPKO MEFs treated for 7 days with 6AN (20 µM). Values are normalized to that
  of untreated MEFs. (D) Cell viability assessed by crystal violet staining of MDA-MB-436
  cells transfected with control siRNA (siC) or RIP140 siRNA (siRIP#1, siRIP#2) and
  treated for 7 days with 6AN (20 µM). Values are normalized to that of untreated
  control siRNA. (E) Number of colonies from a colony formation in soft-agar assay
  of transformed WT or RIPKO MEFs transfected with shRNA control or G6PD expression
  lentivirus and treated for 4 weeks with 6AN (20 µM). The data are expressed as percentages
  of WT untreated control samples. (F) Tumor volume of transformed MEF WT or RIPKO
  xenografted in nude mice (n = 6) after eighteen days of 6AN administrated intra-peritoneally
  every other day (0.1 mg/g). All experiments were conducted at least three times.
  Values are means ± SEM; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns = not significant.
  The colors of asterisks correspond to the same differences as in A.
