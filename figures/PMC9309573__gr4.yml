caption: '17β-estradiol regulates BMSC migration and vascular development. A. Network
  diagram of 17β-estradiol regulating the migration process of BMSC. The size of the
  node area and font size are positively related to the Degree value of the node.
  B. The network diagram of 17β-estradiol regulating the angiogenesis process of BMSC.
  The size of the node area and font size are positively related to the Degree value
  of the node. C. A typical picture of 24 h of BMSC cell scratches in each group.
  The area between the red lines represents the scratch area of the 0 h cell, and
  the area between the green lines represents the scratch area of the 24 h cell. Ruler = 100 μm.
  D. Comparison of scratch rate of BMSC cells in each group in 24 h. *P＜0.01(n = 3),
  #P＜0.01(n = 3). E. The typical photos of CD31-labeled BMSCs in each group detected
  by immunofluorescence experiment. Ruler = 100 μm. F. Comparison of CD31-labeled
  optical density values of MSCs in each group. *P＜0.01(n = 3), compare with the control
  group; #P＜0.01(n = 3), compared with the 17β-estradiol group. (For interpretation
