caption: FBXW7 Regulates Breast Cancer-Related Signaling Pathways. Red arrows indicate
  inhibition, black arrows facilitation, and green arrows indicate interaction facilitation
  or crosstalk. Delta or Jagged binds to the NOTCH receptor to activate the NOTCH/NICD
  pathway. FBXW7 inhibits NICD1/NICD4 expression by promoting NICD1/NICD4 ubiquitination,
  which inhibits CSL DNA binding proteins downstream of the NOTCH pathway and target
  genes HES1, SLUG, and Hey1. Akt inhibits GSK-3-mediated upregulation of FBXW7, while
  FBXW7 in turn inhibits the PI3/Akt/mTOR pathway by promoting proteasomal degradation
  of Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α. C/EBPδ-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR-NF-κB crosstalk involves FBXW7.
  C/EBPδ promotes mTOR accumulation by inhibiting FBXW7 expression. IKKα is activated
  by Akt and C/EBPδ and inhibited as a substrate for FBXW7. CDK and cyclin create
  a complex that activates Rb when phosphorylated, while FBXW7 ubiquitinates and degrades
  CDK and cyclin to sustain the cell cycle. Uncontrolled transcription of downstream
  target genes by FBXW7 will cause anomalies in cell proliferation, cell cycle processes,
  metastasis, invasion, and immunosuppression. FBXW7, F-box and WD repeat domain-containing

  protein-delta. CSL, CBFl/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag1. NICD1, NOTCH intracellular
  domain 1. mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin. NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B.
