caption: Whole transcriptome analysis of BMDMs treated with activin A in vitro. Experimental
  set-up for transcriptomic analysis in BMDMs. Cells were left untreated (CTRL) or
  stimulated with 50 ng/ml activin A (Act), 250 ng/ml FST288 (FST), or a combination
  of both (Act + FST) (A; n = 3). Venn diagram of up- (B) and downregulated (C) DEGs
  in BMDMs treated with Act, Act + FST, or FST versus CTRL cells. Heat map (D) showing
  expression of the top 50 DEGs in CTRL, Act, Act + FST, and FST groups (based on
  false discovery rate > 0.05 and minimal count number > 5). Heat maps showing significant
  DEGs enriched for the terms “Inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling
  pathway” (E) and “Extracellular matrix organization” (F) from the Panther and Reactome
  databases, respectively in CTRL, Act, Act + FST, and FST groups of BMDMs, presented
  with Z-score normalization. Arrows indicate the investigated genes
