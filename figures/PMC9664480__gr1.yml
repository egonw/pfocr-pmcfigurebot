caption: Postoperative nutritional status of patients with different digestive tract
  reconstruction methods after radical gastrectomy. (A) Comparison of SMI, SFI, and
  VFI values preoperatively and one year after surgery. (B) Rates of changes in the
  SMI, SFI, VFI, and BMI before and one year after surgery in the B-I, B-II, and R-Y
  reconstruction groups. (C) Subgroup analysis of patients in each group with preoperative
  basic BMI values below the median. The rates of changes in the SMI, SFI, VFI, and
  BMI of patients in different digestive tract reconstruction groups before and one
  year after surgery. (D) Cluster analysis of the SMI, SFI, VFI, and BMI according
  to different digestive tract reconstruction methods. The axes represent the two
  most informative principal coordinates (PCs) of the PCoA analysis, with marginal
  boxplots describing the distribution in the different groups. The dots in different
  colors represent the variables analyzed. A pairwise test was used to compare PC1
  or PC2 values between the groups, and P-values are shown beside the marginal boxplots.
  The results of the PERMANOVA to compare dissimilar indexes among the samples are
  shown in the lower-left corner of the figure. (E) Cluster analysis of preoperative
  BMIs below the median in each group and combined SMI, SFI, VFI, and BMI values according
  to different digestive tract reconstruction methods was performed. (F) Correlation
  between the PNI one year after surgery and the rate of change in BMI during this
  period. (G and H) Subgroup analysis of the correlation between the PNI one year
  after surgery and the rate of change in BMI during this period for preoperative
  BMI values below the median (G) and greater to or equal to the median (H).
