caption: The expression of miR-29b is significantly reduced in non-small-cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC cells in vitro.
  (a) GDS4794 from the GEO data set was collected, and paracancerous and lung cancer
  tumor samples were analyzed. (b) miR-29b expression was decreased in NSCLC cells.
  (c) The survival rate of lung cancer patients was analyzed using the data downloaded
  from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
