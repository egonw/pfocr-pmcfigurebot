caption: Effects of dietary glycerol monolaurate on cecal microbiota composition of
  lipopolysaccharide-challenged broilers. Microbial composition at the phylum and
  family levels (A, B); relative abundances analysis (C). a-c Means with no common
  superscripts differ significantly (P < 0.05). Means are based on 6 replicates per
  treatment with 1 bird per replicate. CON = control, birds fed a basal diet; GML = glycerol
  monolaurate, birds fed a basal diet containing 1,200 mg/kg GML; LPS = lipopolysaccharide,
  birds fed a basal diet and challenged with LPS; LPS + GML = birds fed a basal diet
  containing 1,200 mg/kg GML and challenged with LPS.
article_title: Glycerol monolaurate attenuated immunological stress and intestinal
  mucosal injury by regulating the gut microbiota and activating AMPK/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway in lipopolysaccharide-challenged broilers.
