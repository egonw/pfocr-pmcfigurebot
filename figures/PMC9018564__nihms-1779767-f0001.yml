figure_title: Transcriptome profiling of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PC cells
caption: A, Differentially expressed genes between VCaP with (n=2) or without (n=2)
  WNT3a/RNF43 knockdown (p-value <0.05). B, Differentially expressed genes between
  VCaP with control siRNA (n=2) and APC siRNA (n=2) (p-value <0.05). C, Overlap of
  differentially expressed genes from the two treatments. D, Enriched pathways based
  on shared genes. E, Enriched pathways for genes regulated only by APC. Enrichment
  was by Metacore Pathway Enrichment Analysis, p<0.01. Blue stripes, enrichment for
  the common 124 genes; Orange solid bars, enrichment for genes uniquely regulated
  with RNF43i/WNT3a; blue solid bars, enrichment for genes uniquely regulated upon
  APC knockdown.
