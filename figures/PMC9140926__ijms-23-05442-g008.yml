caption: 'Effect of PUG on activating MAPKs in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells: RAW264.7
  cells were pretreated without or with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then the cells
  were treated with PUG (4, and 6 μM) for 24 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the protein
  was harvested from the cells and a Western blot was performed. The values were calculated
  by densitometry and the relative density was calculated with the total form of the
  protein. Three independent values were used for the calculation. The statistical
  significance was ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated group; and *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-alone
  treated group.'
