caption: Effect of the hydrogel topical application of cefepime and CFE once daily
  for 14 successive days on the mean fold change of the mRNA relative expression of
  growth factors signaling pathway (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, GLP-1, GLPr-1, EGF, EGFr, VEGF,
  and FGF) to internal control gene Gapdh (A–D) and collagen deposition (E,F) of a
  diabetic wound infected with P. Mirabilis in Type 1 diabetic rats. (A) mRNA relative
  expression of PPAR-α to internal control gene Gapdh, (B) mRNA relative expression
  of PGC1-α to internal control gene Gapdh, (C) mRNA relative expression of GLP-1
  to internal control gene Gapdh, (D) mRNA relative expression of GLPr-1 to internal
  control gene Gapdh, (E) mRNA relative expression of EGF to internal control gene
  Gapdh, (F) mRNA relative expression of EFGr to internal control gene Gapdh, (G)
  mRNA relative expression of VEFG to internal control gene Gapdh, and (H) mRNA relative
  expression of FGF to internal control gene Gapdh. **** very distinctive difference;
  *** Distinctive difference; ** Moderate difference; * Scant difference.
