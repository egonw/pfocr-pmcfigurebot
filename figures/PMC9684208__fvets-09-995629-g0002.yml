caption: Expression and functional enrichment analysis of DE-circRNAs. (A) Volcano
  plots reveal the abundance of circRNAs in mammary epithelial cells of cows in the
  HMF and LMF groups. (B) Clustering of the 100 circRNA expression profiles with the
  most remarkable differences between the HMF and LMF groups. (C) Significantly enriched
  DE-circRNAs and lipid metabolism-related GO term (each lattice represents a term,
  the size of the lattice area represents how many genes are enriched for that term,
  and color represents significance). (D) DE-circRNAs were enriched in signaling pathways
  related to lipid metabolism (the size of the dots represents how many genes are
  enriched in that pathway).
