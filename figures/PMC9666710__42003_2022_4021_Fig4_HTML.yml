figure_title: Workflow for cardiac sarcomere pTyr identification of normal and TgErbB2
  hypertrophic myofilaments by TMT quantitative proteomics
caption: a Myofilament from Ntg (n = 3) and ErbB2 (n = 3) transgenic mice hearts were
  freshly isolated on ice-cold buffers containing Proteinase and Phosphatase Inhibitors
  Cocktails (Roche). b All material was resuspended in TEAB, then reduced and alkylated.
  Tryptic peptides were desalted and labeled with 6-plex isobaric tandem mass tags
  (TMT). c The digested and labeled peptides were pooled and desalted with C18 SEP-PAK.
  The enrichment for phosphotyrosine was performed with PTMScan Phospho-Tyrosine Rabbit
  mAb (P-Tyr-1000) kit (Cell Signaling Technology). The eluted peptide samples were
  desalted using C18 STAGE tips d Easy-nanoLC 1200 nanoflow liquid chromatography
  system coupled to Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid.
