caption: 'ABrightfield images of human patient‐derived organoids (PDOs) from gastric
  cancer with and without RTK/MAPK alterations (scale bar 100 μm, zoom in 40 μm).BDrug
  response curves of PDOs upon treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (biological
  replicates n = 3, data are presented as mean, SD values are shown in Table ).CDrug
  response curves upon HDAC inhibition with panobinostat (PAN) and entinostat (ENT)
  (biological replicates n = 3, data are presented as mean, SD values are shown in
  Table ).DComparison of the relative area under the curve (AUCrel) upon trametinib
  treatment in RTK/MAPK‐altered (mean AUCrel: 0.5308; biological replicate n = 7)

  treated with HDAC inhibitors (green: PDOs with RTK/MAPK alterations; black: PDOs
  without RTK/MAPK alterations; orange: normal PDOs).FCorrelation coefficients for
  the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib and the HDAC inhibitors PAN, ENT, tacedinaline (TAC)
