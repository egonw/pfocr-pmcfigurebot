caption: 'NO stimulates Zn2+ mobilization through the GC/cGMP/PKG pathway. Representative
  traces in the presence or absence of ZnCl2 or NONOate (20 μM), which were immediately
  inhibited by addition of TPEN (10 μM) (A). Fluorescence intensity traces were normalized
  to the signal obtained at time zero and were presented as F/F0. Representative fluorescence
  images at baseline and 6 min after exposure to 20 μM NONOate with or without GC
  inhibitor LY83583 (LY; 10 μM) or PKG inhibitor KT5823 (KT; 10 μM) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts
  (B). NONOate clearly enhanced fluorescence intensity and was reversible with the
  addition of TPEN (10 μM). Both LY83583 and KT5823 blocked the action of NONOate.
  Summary data of FluoZin™-3 fluorescence intensity after 6 min of exposure to NONOate
  with or without LY83583 and KT5823 was expressed as a percentage of baseline. Results
  are shown as the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared
  to the untreated group. #p < 0.05 compared to the group treated with NONOate alone.'
