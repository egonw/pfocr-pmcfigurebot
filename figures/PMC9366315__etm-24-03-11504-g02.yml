caption: 'Downregulation of IL-32 expression attenuates H/R-induced inflammation and
  apoptosis. (A) The expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were assessed using
  the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay. (B) The expression levels of p-p65,
  p65 and COX-2 were assessed with western blot analysis. (C) The induction of apoptosis
  in each group was determined with the TUNEL assay. (D) The expression levels of
  the apoptosis-related proteins were determined using western blot analysis. ***P<0.001
  vs. control; ###P<0.001 vs. H/R + siRNA-NC. IL, interleukin; H/R, hypoxia and reoxygenation;
  p-, phosphorylated; COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; siRNA, small interfering RNA.'

  inflammation and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling
  pathway.
