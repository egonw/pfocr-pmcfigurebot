caption: 'Characterization of the intracellular calcium concentration between epidermal
  and dermal cells. A. RNA-seq compares gene expression between 6 h and D2 skin organoid
  culture. KEGG analysis shows the Ca2+ signaling pathway enriched in differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) of D2 vs 6 h cultures (left); Volcano plot shows Ca2+ signaling
  pathway genes expression in D2 vs 6 h skin organoid cultures (right). B. Fluo-4
  AM fluorescent probe detected Ca2+ concentration at 6 h and D2. C. Fluo-4 AM fluorescent
  probe detected Ca2+ concentration within Ca2+ inhibitor (ruthenium red, iCa2+) or
  Ca2+ activator (thapsigargin, aCa2+) cultures at 6 h, D2 and D3. D. Statistics of
  intracellular calcium concentration in epidermal and dermal cells at 6h, D2 and
  D3. E. Statistics of intracellular calcium concentration in epidermal and dermal
  cells in iCa2+ and aCa2+ groups at 6 h. F. Statistics of intracellular calcium concentration
  in epidermal and dermal cells in iCa2+ and aCa2+ groups at D2. G. Statistics of
  intracellular calcium concentration in epidermal and dermal cells in iCa2+ and aCa2+
  groups at D3. N â‰¥ 3, *p < 0.05, and # no significant change.'
