caption: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation is essential for ROS-stimulated cell
  proliferation in CEPCs(A) CCK8 detection in TKE2 cells treated with 10, 25, 50,
  100, and 250 μM H2O2 for 24 h, relative to untreated control cells.(B) CCK8 detection
  in hLECs treated with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM H2O2 for 24 h, relative to
  untreated control cells.(C) Total AKT and pAKT were evaluated by western blot in
  cornea after SD for 5 and 10 days, relative to NC mice.(D) Total AKT and pAKT were
  evaluated by western blot in TKE2 cells treated with 10 or 25 μM H2O2 for 30, 60
  and 120 min.(E) Total AKT and pAKT were evaluated by western blot in TKE2 cells
  treated with or without 25 μM H2O2 and/or 25 μM LY294002.(F) CCK8 detection in TKE2
  cells treated with or without H2O2 and/or LY294002.(G) Total AKT and pAKT were evaluated
  by western blot in hLECs treated with 2.5 μM H2O2 for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120
  min.(H) Total AKT and pAKT were evaluated by western blot in hLECs treated with
  or without 2.5 μM H2O2 and/or 25 μM LY294002.(I) CCK8 detection in hLECs treated
  with or without H2O2 and/or LY294002. Data of CCK8 assay and western blotting are
  representative of three independent experiments (mean ± SEM; A and F, n = 6 technical
  replicates/group; B and I, n = 8–16 technical replicates/group).
