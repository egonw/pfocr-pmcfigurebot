caption: Potential regulatory network of ethylene-induced anthocyanin accumulation
  in both mulberry genotypes. (A) Percentage differences of gene expression in fruits
  of ZJ relative to DS at post-flowering stage III (27 days), expressed as fold changes
  (FC). Three technical replicates were performed on three independent biological
  samples for each gene represented in the histogram. The percentage differences expressed
  in FC of ZJ relative to DS are depicted in different colors. (B,C) Protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network involving the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related
  to the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and heat shock proteins (HSPs) gene family
  for both mulberry genotypes (ZJ and DS). The DEGs include the upregulated genes
  (B) and downregulated ones (C). The Detailed information about the genes is provided
  in . The 22 genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis are highlighted in green.
  (D) A simplified mechanistic model of the ethylene-induced anthocyanin accumulation
  in both mulberry genotypes to various extents thanks to the ERF. The scale bars
  with different colors represent the FC of gene expression in ZJ relative to DS at
  stage III (27 days).
