caption: High CDC42 expression correlates with TNBC risks. (A–C) Gene expression profiles
  of human CDC42 and ACTR2 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines (from the Human
  Protein Atlas). Statistical significance was assessed by the Student’s t-test (*
  p < 0.05). (D) Kaplan–Meier survival plots of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
  in breast cancer patients (all patients and TNBC subset) over a span of up to 180
  months, based on CDC42 and ACTR2 expressions. “HR” stands for “hazard ratio”, and
  “log-rank P” refers to the p-value obtained from a log-rank test.
