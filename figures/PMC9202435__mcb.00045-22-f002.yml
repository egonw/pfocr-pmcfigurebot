caption: Reduced Rad3 kinase signaling of the DRC pathway in sn134 and hus167. (A)
  Phosphorylation of Mrc1 by Rad3 was reduced to 25 to 39% of wild-type level in sn134
  and hus167 in the presence of HU (left) or MMS (right). Wild-type and mutant cells
  used in  were treated with (+) or without (−) 15 mM HU for 3 h or 0.01% MMS for
  90 min. Phosphorylation of Mrc1 (top panels) was detected in whole-cell lysates
  using phospho-specific antibodies. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with
  anti-Mrc1 antibodies (middle panels). A section of the Ponceau S-stained membrane
  is shown for loading (bottom panels). The Mrc1 phosphorylation bands were quantified,
  and the intensities relative to the drug-treated wild-type cells are shown at the
  bottom. (B) The Western blotting experiment shown in panel A was repeated three
  times, and the quantitation results are shown as percentages. Error bars represent
  the means and SDs (***, P < 0.05, in comparison with the drug-treated wild-type
  cells). (C). Phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3 was reduced to 23 to 35% of wild-type
  level in sn134 and hus167 in the presence of HU (left panels) or MMS (right panels).
  Wild-type, rad3, sn134, and hus167 cells were treated with 15 mM HU for 3 h (left
  panels) or 0.01% MMS for 90 min (right panels). Cds1 was immunoprecipitated and
  then analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (bottom panels). The
  same membrane was stripped and blotted with a phosphor-specific antibody for Cds1
  phosphorylation (top panels). The phosphorylation bands were quantified, and relative
  intensities are shown at the bottom. (D) The experiments shown in panel C were repeated
  three times, and the quantitation results are shown. ***, P < 0.05. (E) Phosphorylation
  of Rad9 by Rad3 was minimally affected in sn134 and hus167. Wild-type and mutant
  cells were treated with HU (left panels) or MMS (right panels). Rad9 was immunoprecipitated
  for Western blotting. The blot was first probed with an anti-HA antibody (bottom
  panels), stripped, and then probed with the phospho-specific antibody (top panels).
  The relative phosphorylation signals are shown at the bottom. (F) The experiment
  in panel E was repeated three times, and the quantitation results are shown. ***,
  P < 0.005; ns, no significant difference. (G) Phosphorylation of Chk1 by Rad3 was
  minimally affected in sn134 and hus167. The cells were treated with or without 0.01%
  MMS for 90 min. Chk1 was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE for Western
  blotting. The band intensities were quantitated, and the ratios of phosphorylated
  Chk1 versus total Chk1 in each sample are shown on the bottom. (H) The experiment
  in panel G was repeated three times, and the quantitation results are shown as ratios
  of phosphorylated Chk1 versus total Chk1. ***, P < 0.005; ns, no significant difference.
