caption: Canonical pathways of differentially expressed hepatic genes between DLY
  chicks and E18 embryos. (A) Genes with a fold-change ≥2; FDR p-value≤0.05 and (B)
  Genes with a fold-change ≥5; FDR p-value≤0.05. Orange indicates a positive z-score;
  expression patterns of members predicts activation of the pathway. Blue indicates
  a negative z-score; expression patterns of members predicts inhibition of the pathway.
