caption: Gene expression signatures coupled with databases of drug-induced changes
  in gene expression can be used to identify potential transcriptional inhibitors.
  General signatures of gene expression changes mediated by specific transcription
  factors have been defined. The availability of large databases, such as the Connectivity
  Map, provides an opportunity to query a large number of drugs to identify those
  that induce gene expression changes most negatively correlated with the gene signature
  being queried. “Hits” from this computational approach hold the potential to be
  inhibitors of the specific pathway. Through this approach, the anti-parasitic drug
  atovaquone was identified as a therapeutically accessible inhibitor of STAT3-dependent
  transcription.
