figure_title: The PVT1/CypB/STAT3 pathway is characteristic of primary CRC tissues
caption: 'A–F Correlation of PVT1 and CypB with STAT3-downstream targets using TCGA
  data of COAD and READ by GEPIA database (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). Y-axis, transcripts
  per million (TPM) of STAT3 targes; X-axis, TPM of PVT1 and CypB. Expression of PVT1
  and CypB were positively correlated with CCND1 A, CDK1 B, BAX C, BIRC5 D, SNAIL1
  E, and CTNNB1 F. G The cases in TMA cohort were divided into two groups: high BMI
  (BMI ≥ 26) and low BMI (BMI <26). The representative images of high level of PVT1,
  nuclear CypB and pSTAT3 were shown in upper panel, while the low level of PVT1,
  nuclear CypB and pSTAT3 were shown lower panels. Scale Bars: 100 μm (main); 400 μm
  (inset). H The levels of BMI levels were positively correlated with expression of
  PVT1, CypB and pSTAT3 in CRC tissues. I Kaplan-Meier curves of patients with low
  vs high expression of PVT1 in TMA cohort. J PVT1 levels in TCGA data of COAD (left,
  P < 2e-12) and READ (right, P < 2e-12). K Kaplan-Meier curves of patients with low
  vs high expression of PVT1 in TCGA cohort of COAD (left, n = 286; P = 0.0134, HR = 2.077)
  and READ (right, P = 0.13). L Proposed working model in this study showing HFD-induced
  IL-6/STAT3 activation expedited by CypB, followed by STAT3 nuclear translocation
  and transcription of STAT3 targets, which increase cell proliferation, survival,
  and metastasis. A feedforward regulation of STAT3 promotes PVT1 transcription and
  its interaction with CypB, which reciprocally promotes STAT3 activation.'
