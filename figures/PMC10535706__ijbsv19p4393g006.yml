caption: 'Tryptophan inhibits subcutaneous xenograft of colorectal cancer through
  AhR mediated β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway. (A) Schematic diagram of the xenograft mouse
  model gavaged with Tryptophan (B, C) Representative data of tumors in the nude mice
  bearing DLD-1/AhR-/- and DLD-1/AhR+/+ cells (1 × 106 cells) treated with or without
  Tryptophan in different groups. N=5/group. Statistical analysis of tumor volume.
  (D) Immunohistochemical staining of AhR, β-catenin, LEF1, TCF4 in different groups.
  Scale bar: 100 μM. (E) The mRNA expression level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream
  effector like GSK-3β, Axin2, c-Myc and cyclin D1 were evaluated in tumor tissues.
  Data are presented as the means ± SD of five animals per experimental group with
  Welch''s correction, one-tailed t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
