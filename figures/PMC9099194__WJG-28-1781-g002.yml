caption: 'Forkhead Box q1 knockdown induces heparin binding epidermal growth factor
  suppression and epidermal growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor signaling
  pathway blockade in vitro according to transcriptional analysis of the generated
  forkhead Box q1 knockdown cell line. A: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
  reaction was performed to evaluate mRNA expression in the knockdown of forkhead
  Box q1 in DLD1 cells (DLD1-shFOXQ1) and SW480-shFOXQ1 cells (two-tailed, unpaired
  Student’s t test). Bars represent the mean ± SE of three independent experiments;
  B: Western blotting was performed to evaluate FOXQ1 protein expression in DLD1-shFOXQ1
  and SW480-shFOXQ1 cells; C: Volcano plot illustrating differentially expressed genes
  using the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) array
  to compare DLD1-shFOXQ1 and DLD1-shControl cells. The vertical blue points in the
  plot represent 84 genes related to the EGF/PDGF signaling pathways. The vertical
  green line indicates a fold-change in gene expression of 1. The vertical pink lines
  indicate the threshold for fold-change (≥ 2.0 and ≤ -2.0). The horizontal blue line
  indicates the threshold for the P value of the t test. aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01; cP
  < 0.001. DLD1-shFOXQ1: The knockdown of forkhead Box q1 in DLD1 cells; SW480-shFOXQ1:
  The knockdown of forkhead Box q1 in SW480 cells.'
