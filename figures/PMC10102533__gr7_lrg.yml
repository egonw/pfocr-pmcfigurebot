caption: 'PGLYRP1-Fc ameliorates inflammatory response via inhibiting the NF-κB pathway
  in miceMice were first subcutaneously injected with PGLYRP1-Fc (1 mpk) or buffer
  control one day in advance, and i.t. administered with 50 × 106 CFU of E.coli diluted
  in 50 μL saline or 50 μL saline and then given PGLYRP1-Fc (1 mpk) or buffer control
  by subcutaneous injection at day 0. The mice’s lung was collected at 1 dpi.(A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of the left lung sections using antibodies against phosphorylated-NF-κB-p65.
  Scale bar, 50 μm.(B) Western blot analysis of phosphorylated-AKT, AKT, phosphorylated-NF-κB-p65,
  and NF-κB-p65 expression from the right lungs of WT and PGLYRP1-Fc treated mice
  with or without bacterial challenge at 1 dpi.(C and D) Phosphorylated-AKT, phosphorylated-NF-κB-p65
  and corresponding total protein expression was quantified by Image J. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 3), ∗p < 0.05 versus sham, and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus sham. #p < 0.05
  versus E.coli,and ##p < 0.01 versus E.coli.'

  and protects against fatal lung injury during bacterial infection.
