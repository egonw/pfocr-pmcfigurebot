caption: Insulin receptor (IR) signal transduction and biased agonism. A, Insulin
  signaling via IR substrate (IRS) proteins that interact with downstream target proteins
  to activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) pathways.
  The Ras/Raf-mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is critical for proliferative
  responses. B, Schematic phosphoproteomics workflow. Following exposure of cells
  to a hormone under 2 conditions (gold and blue), respective lysates are digested
  with protease(s). Phosphopeptides are identified by liquid chromatography with tandem
  mass spectrometry. C and D, Biased signaling can be triggered by agonists via subtle
  differences in ligand-receptor conformations. C, Left, IR-targeted phage-displayâ€“derived
  peptides (purple circle, pentagon, and diamond) () defined potential IR allosteric
  control sites (, ). Bidirectional horizontal arrow between the tyrosine kinase (TK)
  domains indicates their proximity on receptor activation. D, IR signaling pathways
  mediate the divergent downstream outputs. The binding of a ligand can result in
  unbalanced activation of signaling by enhancing one output and reducing another.
  In hepatocytes (left) the goal is to minimize lipid synthesis relative to control
  of glucose output; in cancer cells (right) the goal is to inhibit mitogenicity ().
