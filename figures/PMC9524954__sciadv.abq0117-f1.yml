figure_title: OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCLs have similar pyruvate metabolic profiles
caption: '(A) Aggregated MPC1 and MPC2 mRNA expression data from 71 OxPhos- and 83
  BCR-DLBCL patient samples. Data from GSE10846. (B) Western blot analysis of MPC1,
  MPC2, VDAC, and α-tubulin from a panel of OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCL cell lines. (C)
  Schematic of d-[U-13C]-glucose tracing. MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; UK-5099,
  MPC inhibitor; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; GPT2, glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2. (D)
  Quantification of the isotopologue abundance of M + 2 citrate in OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCL
  cells cultured with d-[U-13C]-glucose ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 30 min, 1
  hour, and 2 hours. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent biological
  experiments, ± SD. (E to G) Quantification of the isotopologue abundances of M +
  0 and M + 2 citrate, M + 0 and M + 2 α-KG, and M + 0 and M + 2 succinate in OxPhos-
  and BCR-DLBCL cells cultured with d-[U-13C]-glucose ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099
  for 4 hours. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent biological
  experiments, ± SD. (H) Quantification of the isotopologue abundances of M + 0 and
  M + 3 alanine in OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCL cells cultured with d-[U-13C]-glucose ± the
  MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 4 hours. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent
  biological experiments, ± SD. Vehicle: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ns, P > 0.05;
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Data were analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.'
