caption: Schematic diagram of selected natural biomolecules and their possible target
  sites in JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling in AD pathogenesis. Pathogenic microbes, allergens,
  and environmental toxins often attack the skin, accelerating inflammation by releasing
  cytokines, which are activated by antigen presenting cells, leading to AD. Antigen-presenting
  cells activate na√Øve Th0 cells, making them mature and differentiate into Th2 cells.
  TH2 cells release cytokines, leading to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in stimulated
  mast cells and further enhancing the release of inflammatory cytokines, which are
  causative factors for various allergic diseases including AD. The cytokines released
  cause pruritus and skin barrier dysfunction, thereby increasing the severity of
  AD. Simultaneously, the negative regulators of JAK/STAT signaling, namely SOCS proteins
  (SOCS1, 3, and 5), are activated to block STAT phosphorylation to control excessive
  cytokine-mediated skin damage. Possible involvement of selected natural biomolecules
  at target sites through inhibiting the cytokine release via Th2 cells or enhancing
  the expression of SOCS proteins, thereby negatively regulating activation of JAK/STAT
  signaling in the management of AD pathogenesis, is shown.
