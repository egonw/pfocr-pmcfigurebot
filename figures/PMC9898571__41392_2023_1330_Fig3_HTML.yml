caption: Activated Wnt canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways in OA. In healthy
  articular cartilage, the Wnt signaling pathway in articular cartilage and synovium
  is profoundly inhibited by the absence of Wnt-Wnt receptor interactions and β-catenin
  degradation through the proteasome pathway. In OA chondrocytes and synovial membrane
  cells, Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled/LRP5/6 receptors to activate the canonical pathway,
  in which the destruction complex moves to the cell membrane and releases β-catenin
  to translocate to the nucleus and binding with TCF/LEF family to control target
  gene transcription. For the non-canonical Wnt pathway, the protein kinase C (PKC)
  and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) are activated to upregulate downstream target
  genes and pathways, including the calcium pathway
