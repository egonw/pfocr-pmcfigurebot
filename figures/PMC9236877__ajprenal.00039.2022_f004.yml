caption: Urine glycolysis intermediates. Glycolysis metabolites from urine in control
  animals (group 0, red), cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory
  arrest (CPB/DHCA) animals without acute kidney injury (AKI) (group 1, green), and
  CPB/DHCA animals with AKI (group 2, blue) are shown. Metabolites measured in the
  metabolic profile assay are shown in bold along with box/whisker plots and P values.
  Intermediates not measured in this metabolic profile assay are shown in Roman (nonbolded)
  text. Collectively, these data suggest increased glycolytic flux as well as increased
  entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and lactate
  production with CPB/DHCA and potentially further increases with AKI.

  dysregulation in a piglet model of cardiac surgery-induced acute kidney injury.
