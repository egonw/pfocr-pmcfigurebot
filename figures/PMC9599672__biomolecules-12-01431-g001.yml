caption: 'Metabolomic profile of CSF from naive SMA1, SMA2, and SMA3 patients. (A)
  Representative 1D 1H CPMG NMR spectrum obtained from the CSF of one SMA1 patient.
  CSF polar extracts of SMA patients detected the presence of 35 metabolites (1: 2-Hydroxybutyric
  acid; 2: 2-Hydroxyisovalerate; 3: L-leucine; 4: L-isoleucine; 5: L-valine; 6: 3-Hydroxybutyric
  acid; 7: 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate; 8: L-threonine; 9: lactic acid; 10: L-alanine; 11:
  L-lysine; 12: acetic acid; 13: L-glutamine; 14: L-methionine; 15: acetone; 16: acetoacetate;
  17: pyroglutamic acid; 18: succinic acid; 19: pyruvic acid; 20: dimethylamine; 21:
  citric acid; 22: creatine; 23: creatinine; 24: choline; 25: D-glucose; 26: myo-inositol;
  27: fructose; 28: glycerol; 29: L-tyrosine; 30: L-serine; 31: L-phenylalanine; 32:
  L-histidine; 33: L-tryptophan; 34: xantine; 35: formic acid). (B) PLS-DA score scatter
  plots showing the metabolomic profile of CSF from SMA1, SMA 2, and SMA3 patients
  prior to treatment. The cluster analyses are reported in the Cartesian space, which
  is described by the main components, PC1: 20.8% and PC2: 9.5%. PLS-DA was evaluated
  using cross-validation (CV) analysis. CV tests performed according to PLS-DA statistical
  protocol show a significant separation between SMA1, SMA2, and SMA3 at T0 (0.44
  and 0.69 accuracy values on PC1 and PC2, respectively, and positive 0.31 and 0.437
  Q2 indexes). (C) VIP score graphs of the metabolites discriminating the CSF of SMA1,
  SMA2, and SMA3 patients at T0. Metabolites characterized by a VIP score > 1 are
  shown. (D) Diagram of the pathway enrichment analysis showing the most dysregulated
  pathways at baseline. The number of molecules (hits) related to the specific metabolic
  pathway is shown within each bar. (E) Hierarchical heat maps generated by MetaboAnalyst
  software are based on the Euclidean distance and Ward’s algorithm. The bar color
  represents each metabolite’s abundance on a normalized scale from blue (low level)
  to red (high level). The dendrogram at the top is based on the similarity of the
  metabolomic profile relative to each sample cluster. The dendrogram on the left
  is based on the metabolite abundance profiles.'
