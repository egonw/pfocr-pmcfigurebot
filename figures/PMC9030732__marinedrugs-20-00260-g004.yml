caption: 'Effects of PC on gut microbiota in AOM/DSS induced CAC mice. PCA analysis
  on OTU level (A) and microbial relative abundance at phylum level (B) and family
  level (C) were shown. (D) At phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes,
  Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, Deferribacteres, Proteobacteria, Epsilonbacteraeota
  and Verrucomicrobia were affected by PC treatment. (E) Comparison of the relative
  abundance of Muribaculaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae in different
  groups. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4 per group). #p < 0.01; ##p < 0.01
  vs. Cont group; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 vs. AD group.'
