caption: 'Inhibition of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis activated the IGF1R survival
  pathway to reduce apoptosis in angiotensin II-exposed H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Losartan
  (an AT1 receptor inhibitor) reduced the expression levels of AT1 receptor and inhibited
  angiotensin II-AT1 receptor signaling. Downstream IGF1R was upregulated, which further
  enhanced the activity of Akt and inhibited apoptotic markers, including caspase
  8 and caspase 3. The inhibition of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis with losartan
  could be dose-dependent. The protein expression levels were normalized to internal
  control β-actin. The results are expressed as protein fold change in treated groups
  compared with the control. Analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test was used
  to analyze the differences between the groups. Data are represented as mean ± SD
  from three independent experiments (ns: not significant, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'

  phosphatase and tensin homolog and miR-320-3p functions to enhance suppression of
