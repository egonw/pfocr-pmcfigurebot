caption: a QPCR analysis of COX2 mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with
  uncorrelated (un) and siKeap1RNA (k). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected and after
  24 h cells were pre-treated with or without FA 100 Î¼M for 1h and then treated with
  LPS 100 ngr/ml for 4h; total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was analyzed by qPCR. Non-stimulated
  cells worked as control. Significant change in mRNA expression are showed in the
  graph at the left (RAW 264.7 cells transfected with uncorrelated RNA). Levels in
  the graph are expressed in arbitrary units as fold increase compared to controls
  assumed as1, using the endogenous gene HPRT for normalization. The data shown represents
  three independent experiments, each of which performed in triplicate. Asterisks
  (*) indicate significant differences among groups (* p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001).
  b Immunoblot analysis of COX2 protein in RAW264.7 cells transfected with uncorrelated
  and si-Keap1 RNA. RAW 264.7 cells were treated as described above. Total proteins
  were extracted, and immunoblot analysis of COX2 protein level was effectuated. Here,
  a representative image of the protein levels obtained from three replicates after
  normalization with actin is reported. Protein levels are reported in arbitrary units
  as fold increase or decrease compared to controls that are set to 1. Asterisks (*)
  indicate significant differences among groups (**** p < 0.0001).
