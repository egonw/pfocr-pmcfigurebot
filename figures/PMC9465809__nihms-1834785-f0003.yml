figure_title: Mapping global transcriptional dysregulation in DS and FXS hPSC models
caption: (A) Schematic of isogenic DS cell lines used for RNA-seq analysis, including
  five replicates per cell line and genotype.(B) Volcano plots of transcripts from
  DS hPSCs (left) and neurons (right). Log2 fold change is shown on the x axis, with
  the −log10 of the adjusted p value shown on the y axis. Positive fold change reflects
  an increase in DS cells relative to euploid cells. Transcripts that reach significance
  of p ≤ 0.05 are shown in the blue shaded area.(C) Bar chart showing the total number
  of significant DEGs for both DS hPSC and neuron datasets as well as the number downregulated
  (gray) versus upregulated (black).(D) Volcano plot of HSA21-encoded transcripts
  from hPSCs (left) and neurons (right). Log2 fold change is shown on the x axis,
  with the −log10 of the adjusted p value shown on the y axis for all transcripts
  detected from HSA21. Transcripts that reach significance of p ≤ 0.05 are shown as
  blue dots.(E and F) Examples of expression patterns for individual genes, including
  two encoded on HSA21 and strongly implicated in DS disease biology (E) and the two
  genes that were most significantly differentially expressed in the hPSC and neuron
  datasets (F). TPM values are shown for five replicates per condition.(G and H) Top
  5 most significant terms identified by canonical pathway analysis using IPA in the
  DS hPSC dataset (G) and neuron dataset (H). The −log10(p value) for each term is
  shown on the x axis.(I) Schematic of isogenic FXS cell lines used for RNA-seq analysis,
  including five replicates per cell line and genotype.(J) Volcano plots of transcripts
  from FXS hPSCs (left) and neurons (right). Log2 fold change is shown on the x axis,
  with the −log10 of the adjusted p value shown on the y axis. Positive fold change
  reflects an increase in FMR1y/− cells relative to FMR1y/+ cells. Transcripts that
  reach significance of p ≤ 0.05 are shown in the purple shaded area.(K) Bar chart
  showing the total number of significant DEGs for both FXS hPSC and neuron datasets
  as well as the number downregulated (gray) versus upregulated (black).(L and M)
  Top 5 most significant terms identified by canonical pathway analysis using IPA
  in the FXS hPSC dataset (L) and neuron dataset (M). The −log10(p value) for each
  term is shown on the x axis. For all panels, significance was calculated by Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted Wald test as part of a DEseq2 RNA-seq experiment and is indicated by *p
  ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.005, and ***p ≤ 0.0005 relative to control. See also  and .
