caption: 'LWE altered the composition and increased the diversity of microbiota in
  Lepr−/− rats. (A) Venn diagram of gut microbiota in different group rats; (B) the
  abundance of the top 10 Phylum among the different group rats; (C) the ratio of
  relative abundance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes; the alpha diversity of the gut
  microbiota with different indices: *** p < 0.001 when compared to WT group; # p
  < 0.05 when compared to KO group. (D) ace index, (E) Chao 1 index, (F) Shannon index,
  and (G) Simpson index; (H) Unweighted UniFrac PCoA (principal coordinates analysis)
  of gut microbiota; (I) Weighted UniFrac PCoA of gut microbiota. Values are means
  ± SEM (n = 4–5). Columns with different letters are significantly different (p <
  0.05).'
