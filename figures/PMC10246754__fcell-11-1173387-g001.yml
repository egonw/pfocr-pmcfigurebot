caption: Schematic representation of membrane trafficking pathways in cancer cells.
  Molecules are secreted either by the conventional pathway involving the ER, Golgi
  complex, and secretory vesicles or by diverse unconventional pathways such as multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) secreting EVs or lysosomal secretion. On the other hand, molecules
  are taken up by endocytosis and can be recycled to the plasma membrane or degraded
  via the endolysosomal system, while dysfunctional internal components are degraded
  by fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis. Imbalance
  in this dynamic membrane trafficking promotes cancer progression by altering the
  presentation and degradation of key membrane proteins, cellular proteostasis, autocrine
  and paracrine signaling to other cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
  and immune cells, and ECM composition and structure. For simplicity, not all membrane
  trafficking pathways are shown; see text for more details. Created in BioRender.
