caption: 'Metabolic changes associated with SVZ NB fate conversion(A) Number of genes
  involved in glycolysis (green), TCA cycle (blue) and mitochondrial respiratory chain
  (red) in each cell population. A gene is considered as expressed in a given population
  if its abundance is >1TPM in at least 25% of the cells.(B) Schematic representing
  the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle. Genes enriched in specific cell populations
  are highlighted with the following color-code: green if enriched in NB, light green
  for NBL, yellow for OligNBL, red for O and dark red for OL. A gene is considered
  as enriched in a cell population if it is differentially expressed between this
  cell population and at least one other population. Detailed mRNA levels are given
  for some glycolysis (Slc2a3, Hk1, Eno1, PKM) and TCA cycle (Idh1, Mdh2) genes.(C
  and D) SVZ cells from GAD67-GFP:Olig2-tdTomato neonate mice were cultured in presence
  or absence of 2DG. GFP+ Tomato+ cells among GFP+ cells were observed (C) and quantified
  (D) in each condition. Scale bars: 50 μm.'
