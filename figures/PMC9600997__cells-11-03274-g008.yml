caption: Mechanisms of crosstalk of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways
  in CD40-mediated cancer cell death. Schematic diagram of the mechanisms underpinning
  mCD40L-mediated colorectal cancer cell apoptosis via crosstalk of intrinsic and
  TRAIL-associated extrinsic apoptotic signalling. CD40 ligation triggers induction
  of TRAF3 and activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) with phosphorylation of the catalytic
  subunit p40phox. Generation of ROS mediates inactivation of Trx-1 and permits ASK1
  activation, subsequent MKK4 phosphorylation, thus leading to phosphorylation of
  p38 which functionally precedes JNK phosphorylation. This signalling axis then diverges
  into two pro-apoptotic pathways. The first pathway utilises p38/JNK-mediated induction
  of ROS-mediated, cyto c/caspase-9-associated, Bak/Bax-engaging mitochondrial apoptosis
  (the pathway previously detected in other carcinoma cell types). The second pathway
  triggered by p38/JNK signalling involves rapid induction of intracellular TRAIL
  (and receptor DR5â€”not depicted), which causes caspase-10 (but not caspase-8)-dependent
  apoptosis and is followed by rapid Bid cleavage (tBid induction) thus mediating
  additional links with mitochondrial apoptosis. Functional experiments suggest that
  CD40-mediated death is partially dependent on the TRAIL/caspase-10/tBid pathway,
  thus this pathway crosstalk appears to amplify and accelerate apoptosis in colorectal
  carcinoma cells in comparison to other tumour cell types (e.g., bladder and renal
  cancer cells) where no such crosstalk with extrinsic (death receptor) apoptosis
  has been observed.
