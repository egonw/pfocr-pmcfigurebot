figure_title: The nuclear cAMP/PKA/LATS signaling cascade inhibits YAP by inducing
  S397 phosphorylation and nuclear export
caption: '(A) Schematic of canonical Hippo signaling.(B) Western blot analysis of
  nuclear cAMP induced phosphorylation of LATS1, YAP, and TAZ (n ≥ 3 biological replicates;
  representative shown).(C) Viability of mouse melanoma colonies in Matrigel following
  either YAP or TAZ knockdown, assessed by ATP content. (–, red), parental cell line;
  (shCTRL, black), parental cell line transduced with scrambled shRNA; (shTAZ, blue);
  (shYAP, green). n ≥ 4 biological replicates; error bars, SEM; two-way ANOVA.(D)
  NLS-sAC reduces Ctgf and Cyr61 expression in parental lines (–, red) and in cells
  transduced with scrambled shRNA (shCTRL, gray), as measured by qRT-PCR. Knockdown
  of YAP (shYAP, green), but not TAZ (shTAZ, blue), abolishes nuclear cAMP effect
  on the expression of these genes. Expression relative to cells without DOX treatment
  (n ≥ 4 biological replicates; error bars, SEM; Student’s t test).(E) Phosphorylation
  of S397 induced by nuclear cAMP does not require S127 phosphorylation (n = 3 biological
  replicates; representative shown). S127A, FLAG-tagged YAP with S127 mutated to alanine;
  Endo, endogenous YAP.(F) Fractionation of melanoma cells demonstrates the presence
  of LATS in both the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions. Active LATS (phosphorylated
  on both S909 and T1079) is enriched in the nuclear fraction of cells after NLS-sAC
  expression (DOX; 24 h). Histone H3 and beta-tubulin markers for nuclear and cytoplasmic
  fractions, respectively (n = 3 biological replicates; representative shown).(G)
  Nuclear cAMP-induced phosphorylation of YAP at S397 is abolished by treatment with
  the sAC inhibitor LRE1, the PKA inhibitor KT5720, and the LATS kinase inhibitor
  TRULI (n = 3 biological replicates; representative shown).(H) Microscopic images
  showing loss of nuclear YAP upon NLS-sAC induction and inhibition of YAP nuclear
  loss by sAC, PKA, and LATS inhibitors (LRE, KT5720, and TRULI, respectively). Scale
  bar: 20 μm.(I) Microscopic images of YAP (purple) nuclear expression following NLS-sAC
  expression in the presence or absence of a nucleus-targeted protein kinase A inhibitor
  (NLS-PKI; green). Scale bar: 20 μm.(J) Quantification of YAP localization represented
  as nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (N/C; top panel) following nuclear cAMP induction
  alone (DOX, 24 h) or in the presence of sAC inhibitor (LRE1), PKA inhibitors (KT5720
  and NLS-PKI), or LATS inhibitor (TRULI); total YAP level for all conditions shown
  (bottom panel). Dashed line within each violin plot, median; dotted lines, quartiles;
  error bars, SEM; one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s correction for multiple comparisons.
  n = 3–6 separate experiments. Total cell number per group: 446 untreated; 477 DOX
  24 h; 221 DOX 24 h/LRE1 1 h; 252 DOX 24 h/KT5720 1 h; 212 DOX 24 h/TRULI 1 h; and
  143 DOX 24 h/NLS-PKI (+).(K) Microscopic image examples of FRAP analysis of EYFP-tagged
  YAP. Bleached nucleus is marked by an arrowhead. Scale bar: 10 μm.(L) FRAP analysis
  of EYFP-YAP following NLS-sAC expression in the presence or absence of the nuclear
  export inhibitor leptomycin B (without leptomycin B: n = 3 separate experiments,
  47 nuclei total per group; with leptomycin B: n = 2 separate experiments, 13 nuclei
  total per group; error bars, SEM; mixed effect ANOVA).(M) FRAP analysis of EYFP-tagged
  YAP-S397A showing no changes in nuclear YAP recovery after NLS-sAC expression (n
  = 3 separate experiments, 52 untreated nuclei and 32 DOX-treated nuclei; error bars,
  SEM; mixed effect ANOVA). (ns, p > 0.05; *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001; ****p
  ≤ 0.0001).See also  and .'
