figure_title: SQLE inhibition activated the PERK- eIF2α pathway
caption: A and B, SQLE inhibition by knockdown or inhibitors (50 μM TF and 8 μM NB-598)
  increased p-eIF2α and ATF4 levels in MCF-7 and HCC-38 cell lines. C, CHOP transcription
  was upregulated by 50 μM TF or 8 μM NB-598 in MCF-7 and HCC-38 cells. All data are
  normalized with Con group. D, eIF2α downregulation abrogated TF-induced WIP1 expression
  in MCF-7 and HCC-38 cells. E and F, SQLE inhibition promoted the expression of p-eIF2a
  and ATF4 in H1299 cell. G, CHOP expression was upregulated following the treatment
  of 50 μM TF or 8 μM NB-598 in H1299 cell. H, eIF2α knockdown eliminated TF-induced
  WIP1 expression in H1299 cells. I, A schematic model for radiosensitization by SQLE
  inhibition. Figure created using BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The data in
  C and G are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was evaluated with
  one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P
  < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; ns, not significant.
