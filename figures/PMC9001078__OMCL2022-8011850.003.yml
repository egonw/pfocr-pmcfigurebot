  potential by regulating ferroptosis via the MAKP signaling pathway in granulosa
  cells. (a) Fluorescence image of GCs stained with JC-1 after different treatments.
  (b) Numerical data of green/red fluorescence-positive GCs. âˆ—p < 0.05, compared to
  control; #p < 0.05 compared to IR; $p < 0.05 compared to IR+CRY; &p < 0.05 compared
  to IR+CRY+ferrostatin-1.'
