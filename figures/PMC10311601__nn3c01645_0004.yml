caption: Gal-NC-mediated gene expression patterns in macrophages. a) Volcano plot
  representing differentially expressed gene (DEG) patterns in Gal-NC-treated macrophages.
  b) Enrichment plots (obtained using GSEA) showing upregulated pathways in Gal-NC-treated
  BMDMs. b) Cytotoxic effects on macrophages after Gal-NC treatment. c) Venn diagrams
  of DEGs with gene sets from BMDMs treated with Gal-NC (experimental) and LPS (GSE1155801)
  obtained from the GEO. d) Heatmap showing immune-associated pathways enriched in
  Gal-NC-treated or LPS-stimulated BMDMs. e) Gal-NC treatment showed a response pattern
  similar to the LPS-mediated TLR signaling pathway in BMDMs. f) NO secretion by Gal-NC-mediated
  TLR4 activation was reduced by pretreatment with TLR4 inhibitors (n = 3). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
