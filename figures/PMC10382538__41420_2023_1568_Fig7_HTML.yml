figure_title: A schematic model of the anti-inflammatory effects of IL4I1 on LPS induced-ALI
caption: IL4I1 induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α catalyzes tryptophan metabolism to produce
  indole metabolites I3P and I3A in MuSCs, which promote TSG-6 production through
  activating AHR signaling pathway, and consequently alleviate ALI. Additionally,
  extracellular I3P can suppress the infiltration of neutrophils into damaged lungs
  and reduce ROS-mediated oxidative damage from neutrophils.
