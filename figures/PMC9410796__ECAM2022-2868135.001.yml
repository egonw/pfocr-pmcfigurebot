caption: The KOR agonist U50448H alleviates lung injury in CPB rats. Extravascular
  lung water and AaDO2, RI, water maze, and neurological function scores were used
  to evaluate postoperative cognitive dysfunction. (a) The results of extravascular
  lung water; (b) the results of AaDO2; (c) the value of RI; (d) the concentrations
  of LPS in the rat serum; (e) the result of H & E staining (scale bar = 50 μm); ∗P
  < 0.05.
