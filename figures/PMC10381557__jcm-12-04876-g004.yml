caption: The proposed six-step approach that takes into consideration the steps of
  the PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycle of quality improvement science to address and
  lower the failure to rescue (FTR) rate. Starting each cycle from the plan of pathway
  and continuing to the next five steps leads to the enhancement of practice and lowering
  of FTR. Nonetheless, as a cycle closes, new goals for improvement are set and a
  new cycle of improvement opens, thus driving a never-ending quality improvement
  process.
