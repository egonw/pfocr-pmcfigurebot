caption: Senescence heterogeneity and associated immune characteristics in tumor microenvironments.
  (A) Heatmaps showing the average CS scores of different cell types (stromal cells,
  myeloid cells, malignant cells and T-cells) in 10 single-cell datasets, which are
  labeled as the cancer type with accession numbers in the GEO database. (B and C)
  The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization shows seven main cell
  types in single-cell prostate cancer data (GSE141445), colored by cell type (B)
  and the CS score (C). (D) Bar plots showing the top 10 enriched Reactome pathway
  terms of DEGs in malignant luminal cells between the high-CS (pink) and low-CS groups
  (green). (E) Dot plots showing the expression of selected DEGs in malignant cells
  between the high-CS and low-CS groups. The dot color corresponds to the average
  expression, and the dot size indicates the percent expressed. (F) Bubble chart showing
  significant ligandâ€“receptor interactions between high-CS/low-CS malignant luminal
  cells (luminal_H/luminal_L) and neighboring cells. Ligands and receptors are shown
  on the x-axis; ligand-expressed cells and receptor-expressed cells are shown on
  the y-axis. The color denotes the average expression levels of ligands and receptors
  in interacting cells, and the bubble size indicates the significance of the interactions
  (permutation test in CellPhoneDB).
