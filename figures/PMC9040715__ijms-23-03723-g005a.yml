caption: Effect of SCS on gut metabolites in tumor-bearing mice. Principal component
  analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the differences of gut metabolite composition
  in each group (A). Heat map of significantly altered fecal metabolites (B), and
  the Pearson correlation coefficient value R is between âˆ’1 and +1. The correlation
  coefficient R between metabolites is expressed in color and circle, where R > 0
  indicates positive correlation and red indicates positive correlation. R < 0 indicates
  negative correlation, expressed in blue; The larger the circle and the darker the
  color, the stronger the correlation. Correlation Clustering matrix of significant
  difference metabolites in each group (C). Enriched KEGG pathway analysis for High
  group vs. Model group (D).
