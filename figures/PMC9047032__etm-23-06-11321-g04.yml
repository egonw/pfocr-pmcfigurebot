caption: Oxaliplatin enhances the inhibitory effect of erastin on the viability of
  colorectal cancer cells. (A) Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to detect the
  effects of oxaliplatin on the viability of HT29 cells in the control, erastin and
  oxaliplatin groups, as well as in the oxaliplatin (3 µM) + erastin group. (B and
  C) TUNEL assay was conducted to assess HT29 cell apoptosis levels in the control,
  erastin and oxaliplatin groups, as well as in the oxaliplatin (3 µM) + erastin group.
  Original magnification 200x. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ***P<0.001.
