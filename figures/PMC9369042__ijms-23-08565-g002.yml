caption: 'MiR-7a2 KO affects ovarian function. (A) KO efficiency of miR-7a2 in the
  ovaries of adult KO mice. (B) The estrus cycle of mice was determined by a vaginal
  smear for 18 consecutive days, comprising dioestrus, proestrus, estrus, and metestrus
  represented by D, P, E, and M, respectively; n = 6. (C) miR-7a2 KO mice and WT mice
  were separately mated with WT male mice for 3 weeks, and the litter sizes were recorded;
  n = 6. (D) Macro-observation of ovaries from adult WT and miR-7a2 KO mice; bars:
  1000 μm. (E) Ovary sections of adult WT and miR-7a2 KO mice were observed by H.E.
  staining. PMF: primodial follicle; PF: primary follicle; SF: secondary follicle;
  SAF: small antral follicle; LAF: large antral follicle; CL: corpus luteum; AT: atretica.
  Bars: 100 μm. (F) The number of different follicles in the ovaries of WT and miR-7a2KO
  mice were analyzed via serial sections; n = 4. (G–I) The expression of Cyp19a1,
  Cyp17a1, and 17β-HSD at the mRNA level in ovaries of adult WT and miR-7a2 KO mice
  was tested by RT-qPCR; n = 4. (J) E2 levels in the serum of adult WT and miR-7a2
  KO mice were detected by RIA. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01. *** p < 0.001. NS, not significant.'
