caption: The stomatal aperture comparison, soil drought test, and water loss rate
  analysis. (a) The stomatal aperture analyses of Col-0, OE PIA1, and pia1 mutants.
  (b) Statistics of the stomatal aperture. (c) Two-week-old plants of Col-0, OE PIA1,
  and pia1 mutants grown in short-light conditions were not irrigated for 15 days.
  (d) Analysis of water loss rate from detached leaves. Data are means Â± SE of three
  replicates. Significances of differences are indicated as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
