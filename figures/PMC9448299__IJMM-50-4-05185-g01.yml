caption: Effect of ZNF667 on the invasion and tube formation of HUVECs exposed to
  hypoxia. HUVECs cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to hypoxic condition for
  different time. (A) The protein expression of ZNF667 was determined by immunoblotting.
  (B) Quantification of immunoblot analysis of ZNF667 (n=3 per group). (C) The mRNA
  expression of ZNF667 in HUVECs was determined by qPCR (n=3 per group). (D) The mRNA
  expression of ZNF667 in HUVECs transfected with ZNF667 siRNA or scramble siRNA was
  determined by qPCR (n=3 per group). (E) The mRNA expression of ZNF667 in HUVECs
  transfected with pcDNA3.1-ZNF667 or pcDNA3.1 was determined by qPCR (n=3 per group).
  (F) Representative micrographs of scratch wound healing assay and (G) in vitro Matrigel
  angiogenesis assay on HUVECs exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions; scale bar=100
  µm. (H) Representative micrographs of scratch wound healing assay and (I) in vitro
  Matrigel angiogenesis assay on HUVECs transfected with scramble siRNA or ZNF667
  siRNA and exposed to hypoxic condition; scale bar=100 µm. (J) Representative micrographs
  of scratch wound healing assay and (K) in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay on HUVECs
  transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDN3.1-ZNF667 and exposed to normoxic condition; scale
  bar=100 µm. (L) Quantitative analysis of scratch wound healing assay and (M) in
  vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay on HUVECs exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions
  (n=5 per group). Relative invasion distance was analyzed by subtracting the final
  invasion area for each image (n=5 per group). (N) Quantitative analysis of the scratch
  wound healing assay and (O) in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay on HUVECs transfected
  with scramble siRNA, ZNF667 siRNA, pcDNA3.1, or pcDN3.1-ZNF667 and exposed to hypoxic
  or normoxic condition (n=5 per group). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.
  ZNF667, zinc finger protein 667; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells;
  siRNA, small interfering RNA.
