caption: 'Strong CD8 T cell reactivity toward 3pRNA-induced dedifferentiated persisters.
  (A, B and D, F) UKE-Mel-164a cells were transfected twice with 3pRNA (+) or Ctrl
  RNA (-) and subjected to further analyses on day 7 post-transfection. (A) Differentiation
  status of UKE-Mel-164a determined by the expression of indicated proteins. GAPDH,
  loading control. Representative data from three independent experiments. (B) Melan-A
  expression determined by flow cytometry. Representative histogram from three independent
  experiments. (C) RIG-I expression and JAK-STAT pathway activation analyzed 24 hours
  post-transfection by western blot. GAPDH, loading control. Representative data from
  three independent experiments. (D) HLA-I cell surface expression measured by flow
  cytometry. Representative histogram from three independent experiments. (E, F) Activation
  of autologous TILs by UKE-Mel-164a cells transfected with 3pRNA or Ctrl RNA analyzed
  by intracellular cytokine staining in flow cytometry. (E) Representative dot plot
  and (F) quantification of IFN-γ+ TNF-α+ CD8+ TILs. Fold change given as mean±SEM
  from three independent experiments. (G–L) Ma-Mel-61a melanoma cells were transfected
  with 3pRNA (+) or Ctrl RNA (-) and subjected to further analyses on day 1 (H) or
  day 3 (G, I–L) post-transfection. (G) Melan-A expression analyzed by flow cytometry.
  Representative data from three independent experiments. (H) RIG-I expression and
  JAK-STAT pathway activation analyzed on day 1 post-transfection by western blot.
  GAPDH, loading control. Representative data from three independent experiments.
  (I, J) HLA-I cell surface expression measured by flow cytometry. (I) Representative
  histogram and (J) fold change of MFI given as mean±SEM from three independent experiments.
  (K, L) Activation of autologous T cells by Ma-Mel-61a cells transfected with 3pRNA
  or Ctrl RNA analyzed by intracellular IFN-γ staining in flow cytometry. (K) Representative
  dot plot and (L) quantification of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells. Fold change given as mean±SEM
  from two independent experiments. (M) RIG-I and JAK/STAT pathway activation analyzed
  24 hours post-transfection with 3pRNA or Ctrl RNA or post-treatment with IFN-γ or
  TNF-α by western blot. GAPDH, loading control. Representative data from two independent
  experiments. (N) Relative mRNA expression of genes involved in antigen processing
  and presentation in Ma-Mel-47 and Ma-Mel-61a cells on day 3 post-3pRNA transfection
  or post-cytokine treatment. Fold change given as mean from two independent experiments.
  Significantly different experimental groups: *p<0.05; ****p<0.001 by two-tailed
  paired t-test. Ctrl, control; IFN, interferon; MITF, Microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I; TIL, tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte; TNF, tumor necrosis factor, w/o: without
  target cells.'
