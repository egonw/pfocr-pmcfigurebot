caption: 'Impacts of MCM3AP-AS1 on the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway. (a) qRT–PCR was used to
  detect the levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 mRNA in HCT116, SW480, and CCD-18Co cells.
  (b) qRT–PCR was used to detect the effect of MCM3AP-AS1 on the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway
  in HCT116 cells. (c) qRT–PCR was used to detect the effect of MCM3AP-AS1 on the
  VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway in SW480 cells. (d) Western blot map of HCT116 cells. (e) Western
  blot detection of the effect of MCM3AP-AS1 on the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway in HCT116
  cells. (f) Western blot map of SW480 cells. (g) Western blot detection of the effect
  of MCM3AP-AS1 on the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway in SW480 cells. Comparison between the
  two groups #P < 0.05.'
