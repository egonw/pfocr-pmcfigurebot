figure_title: Inhibition of ferroptosis pathway by Lip1 increased cell survival from
  H 2O 2-induced cell death
caption: (A) Treatment of Lip1 increased cell viability by approximately 30% in BKO
  cells at 26.5 h after medium exchange. (B) Lip1 treatment significantly increased
  cell viability in both cell types from H 2O 2-induced cell death at 38.5 h after
  medium exchange (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test, n = 6,
  ** p < 0.01 control vs. Lip1).
