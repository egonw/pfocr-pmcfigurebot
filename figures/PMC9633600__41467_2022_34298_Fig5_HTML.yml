figure_title: FGFR2b regulates mTOR signalling and autophagy from the recycling endosomes
caption: a Subnetwork of proteins annotated to mTOR pathway or autophagy based on
  KEGG analysis from Fig. . Node colouring indicates whether the phosphorylated protein
  or the phosphorylated sites from the KEGG term ’autophagy’ were found in global,
  proximal phosphoproteome or both. Sites from Fig.  have a green border. b Immunoblot
  analysis (N = 3 independent biological replicates) with indicated antibodies of
  candidate phosphorylated proteins from the subnetwork (Fig. 5a). T47D were transfected
  with RAB11-APEX2 (T47D_RAB11-APEX2) stimulated with FGF10 for the indicated time
  points. UT, treatment with vehicle as control. Non proximal and proximal samples
  represent the supernatant and the pulldown following enrichment of biotinylated
  samples with streptavidin beads, respectively, and run against total lysates (total).
  c Autophagy measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of T47D cells
  in serum, treated with vehicle (UT), FGF7 or FGF10 for 2 h. Representative images
  and gating are shown in Supplementary Fig. . The number of cells counted is indicated
  below the graph. N = 3 independent biological replicates. p value <0.05 *, p value
  <0.0005 *** (one-way ANOVA with Tukey test). d Autophagy (measured by staining of
  autolysosomes with acridine orange) of HeLa_FGFR2bST, T47D and BT20 treated with
  vehicle (UT), FGF7 or FGF10. N = 3 independent biological replicates where at least
  six treated wells of cells were counted for each N. p value <0.001*** (one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey test). e Immunoblot analysis (N ≥ 3 independent biological replicates)
  with the indicated antibodies of the effect of serum starvation and FGF treatment
  on autophagic markers in T47D. LC3B 2 is the lipidated form of LC3B. Cells were
  treated with vehicle (UT), FGF7 or FGF10. f Immunoblot analysis (N ≥ 3 independent
  biological replicates) with the indicated antibodies of HeLa_FGFR2bST, T47D and
  BT20 treated or not with FGF7 or FGF10 for 2 h. Source data are provided as a Source
