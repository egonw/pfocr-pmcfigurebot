caption: Metabolomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma samples, compared to age-matched
  healthy controls. (A) Principal component analysis of the untargeted metabolites
  of the three groups. (B) Important features identified by PLS-DA. The colored boxes
  indicate relative concentrations of designated metabolites in each study group.
  (C) Hierarchical cluster analysis is shown as a heatmap of the top 50 metabolites
  (FDR < 0.05). (D) Pathway enrichment analysis using KEGG of all the metabolites
  (n = 158) significantly altered during COVID-19 infection. (E) Volcano plot comparing
  the significantly changed (p = 0.001, FC > 1.5) metabolites during the early (V1)
  and later stages of disease (V3).
