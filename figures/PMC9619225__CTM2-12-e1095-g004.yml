caption: 'Screening and identification of oroxylin A as a transketolase (TKT) ligand.
  (A) Molecular structure of oroxylin A. (B) Rapid screening of oroxylin A as a novel
  TKT ligand using the 2D TKT protein biological chromatography/C18 column/time‐of‐flight
  mass spectrometry system. Typical 3D plots of Radix scutellariae extraction (left
  panel) and authentic standard of oroxylin A (right panel). (C) Oroxylin A protects
  TKT from proteolysis by drug affinity responsive target stability assay (DARTS)
  analysis. Samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulphate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
  visualized by silver staining (upper panel), and identified by mass spectrometry
  (lower panel). (D) Samples were probed with an anti‐TKT antibody using GAPDH as
  the control. (E) Western blotting of the supernatant of HepG2 cell lysate incubated
  with 50 μM oroxylin A or dimethyl sulphoxide after heating and centrifugation using
  cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). (F) Quantification of western blotting bands
  (mean ± SD, n = 3). (G) Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of oroxylin A and
  TKT immobilised on a chip (equilibrium dissociation constant = 11.9 ± 8.4 μM; n = 3).
  (H) Predicted binding mode of oroxylin A in the active site of human TKT (PDB code
  3MOS). The protein is shown as a surface with carbon and hydrogen in grey, oxygen
  in red, and nitrogen in blue. The ligand is shown as sticks with carbons in cyan.
  Blue dashed lines are hydrogen bonds. (I) Left panel: Chromatograms of oxythiamine
  on TKT protein columns with various concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 μM) of oroxylin
  A added to the mobile phase. Right panel: Competitive displacement assay of oxythiamine
  on TKT protein columns (presented as Κ values) with various concentrations (0, 2,
  5, 10, and 20 μM) of oroxylin A added to the mobile phase. (J) Protection effects
  of oroxylin A on wild‐type TKT protein (TKT‐WT), histidine 77 site mutated TKT protein
  (TKT‐A77H), and aspartate 155 site mutated TKT protein (TKT‐A155D) using DARTS.'
