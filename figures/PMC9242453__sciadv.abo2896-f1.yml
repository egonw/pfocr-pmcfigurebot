figure_title: The hepatic and muscular clocks are mediating a minority of rhythmic
  metabolic rhythms in the circulation
caption: (A) Venn diagram representing the overlap of significantly oscillating (JTK,
  P < 0.05) serum metabolites between wild-type (WT) and Bmal1 knockout (KO) mice.
  (B) Venn diagram representing the overlap between of significantly oscillating (JTK,
  P < 0.05) serum metabolites in WT, Bmal1 liver-reconstituted (LRE), and Bmal1 muscle-reconstituted
  (MRE) mice. (C) Heatmaps representing the oscillating metabolites overlapping between
  WT and LRE (left heatmap) or WT and MRE (right heatmap). (D) Radar plots illustrating
  the phase of the metabolic oscillations of the overlapping metabolites between WT
  and LRE (left radar plot) or WT and MRE (right radar plot). (E) Graphs displaying
  the amplitudes of the overlapping metabolites between WT and LRE (left graph) or
  WT and MRE (right graph). (F) Pathway enrichment of overlapping metabolites. Significantly
  oscillating metabolites withing the (G) histidine, (H) nicotinate and nicotinamide,
  and (I) drug-topical agents presented in graphs. All analyses were performed using
  n = 4 mice.
