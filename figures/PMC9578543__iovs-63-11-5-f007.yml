caption: Western blot analysis of RASA1, RAS, BAD, and BCL-2. (A) Relative levels
  of the choroidal target proteins RASA1 (B), RAS (C), BAD (D), and BCL-2 (E) in guinea
  pigs in the NC and LIM groups at 2 and 4 weeks, with Î²-actin as an internal reference.
  For the comparison between LIM and NC groups, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P <
  0.001.
