caption: Western blot analysis of hUCN1‐induced, time‐dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  in HeLa cells. The cells were treated with 10 nm hUCN1 for the indicated time points
  or were left untreated as control. A significantly stronger ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  (pERK1 and pERK2) was detected 15 min after the start of the treatment compared
  with the control group. The nonphosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 served as loading
  control during reprobing of the membrane. Relative ERK phosphorylation was determined
  by the phosphorylated/total signal ratio. The values shown are presented by box + whiskers
  plots, indicating median (central horizontal line), min/max values, and mean (with
  ‘+’ within the box) of five independently performed experiments (n = 5). *P < 0.05
  vs. Control (two‐way ANOVA, Dunnett).
