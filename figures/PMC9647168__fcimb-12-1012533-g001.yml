caption: Versatile roles of IpgD during epithelial cell infection. Through PI4,5P2
  (PIP2) hydrolysis, IpgD disconnect cortical actin from plasma membranes, favoring
  bacterial invasion and cell to cell spread. IpgD-mediated production of PI5P stimulates
  actin polymerization via Tiam-Rac activation, down-regulates the recruitment of
  immune cells by inducing ICAM-1 degradation, prevents the opening of connexin hemichannels,
  promotes persistent EGFR signaling by recruiting the TOM1 adaptor to endosome and
  preventing their maturation, and activates cell survival through the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Possibly, these effects could also be linked to increased PI3,4P2 levels associated
  with the IpgD phosphotransferase activity. By decreasing InsP3 levels, IpgD allows
  long lasting local Ca2+ responses during invasion and prevents InsP3-dependent global
  Ca2+ responses at later infection stages. Inhibition of Ca2+ signaling and calpain
  activity favors adhesion of infected cells. Through mechanisms the remain to be
  characterized, IpgD stimulates the formation of macropinosomes during bacterial
  invasion. IpgD also allows the recruitment of Rab11-positive endosomes and the exocyst,
  triggering bacterial unsheathing from the actin cocoon surrounding the BCV and vacuolar
  escape.
