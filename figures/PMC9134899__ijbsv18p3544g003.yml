caption: FOXO1 mediates cancer stemness via transcriptionally regulating IL6 and ALDH1.
  (A) Enriched pathways in response to 8h post-CAP using our whole transcriptome data.
  (B) CSC% on FOXO1 under-/over-expression. (C) Experimental design of the in vivo
  mice study. Mice were inoculated with SUM159PT-FOXO1 or SUM159PT cells on 'day 1',
  recruited to this study when tumors grew to 5±0.5 mm in diameter on 'day 12' and
  'day 21', respectively, treated with CAP every 6 days, and sacrificed on 'day 39'.
  Data from 'day 21' to 'day 39' were plotted. (D) Tumor growth curves in SUM159PT,
  SUM159PT-FOXO1 inoculated mice with/without CAP. Images of (E) tumor, (F) heart,
  lung, liver, spleen and kidney from SUM159PT, SUM159PT-FOXO1 inoculated mice, without/with
  CAP. Weight of (G) spleen, (H) kidney in SUM159PT, SUM159PT-FOXO1 inoculated mice
  without/with CAP. (I) Immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1, FOXO1, IL6 in tumors
  inoculated with SUM159PT, SUM159PT-FOXO1, and SUM159PT-FOXO1 receiving CAP. (J)
  Western blots showing cytoplasm and nucleus levels of FOXO1 and phosphorylated FOXO1
  receiving CAP. (K) Immunofluorescence images of FOXO1 and phosphorylated FOXO1 without/with
  CAP. (L) Genes enriched in top pathways altered in response to CAP according to
  our whole transcriptome data. 'Count' represents the number of times a gene was
  identified; 'Pathway score' is the weighted sum of scores assigned to pathways that
  a gene was identified from. (M) Western blots showing IL6 expression among different
  breast cancer cells. (N) Network of FOXO1 associated genes from our whole transcriptome
  data constructed using GeneMania . (O) Immunofluorescence images of IL6 and ALDH1
  with and without CAP. (P) Western blot results showing the cytoplasm and nucleus
  levels of IL6 and ALDH1 with/without CAP. (Q) Co-immunoprecipitation results showing
  interactions of FOXO1&IL6, FOXO1&ALDH1, without/with CAP. (R) FOXO1 transcription
  factor binding sites in IL6 and ALDH1 predicted from ConTra v3 . ChIP results showing
  transcriptional binding of FOXO1 to (S) IL6 and (T) ALDH1. Except for panel 'M',
  SUM159PT was used as TNBC cells. PAM was prepared under 5min CAP treatment, with
  incubation time was set as 24h for panels 'M', 'Q', 'S', 'T', and 1h for panels
  'J', 'K', 'O', 'P'. Error bars indicate mean ± sd.
