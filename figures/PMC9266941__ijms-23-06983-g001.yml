caption: BMP receptor activation and downstream signalling and its antagonism through
  the Activin A pathway. In the canonical pathway, SMAD1/5/8 is activated and interacts
  with SMAD4 to promote expression of target genes that induce bone formation. In
  the non-canonical SMAD pathway, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and/or JNK are activated to promote
  the expression of osteogenic target genes. BMP signalling is antagonised by the
  binding of Activin A to its receptor complex to initiate SMAD2/3 signalling that
  acts to suppress BMP target gene transcriptional activation.
