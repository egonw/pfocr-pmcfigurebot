caption: The immune landscape of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and identification
  of key differentially expressed CD4+ T cell markers between non‐severe COVID‐19
  and severe COVID‐19 groups. (A) UMAP plot of 27 samples with and without Severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐Cov‐2) in GES163668. (B) UMAP plot
  coloured by various cell clusters in GES163668. (C) Proportions of immune cell clusters
  identified by marker genes in GES163668. (D) CD4+ T cell frequency in COVID‐19 patients
  with different clinical outcomes in GES163668. (E) Comparison boxplot of 24‐immune‐cell
  infiltration between non‐severe COVID‐19 and severe COVID‐19 group in GES157103.
  (F) The heatmap of 24‐immune‐cell infiltration in non‐severe COVID‐19 and severe
  COVID‐19 group in GES157103. (G) Correlation of immune infiltration with clinical
  data. (H) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the non‐severe
  group and severe group of COVID‐19 patients. (I) Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of DEGs. (J) Venn diagram between
  DEGs and CD4+ T cell marker genes. (K) GO‐biological process (BP) enrichment analysis
  of the differentially expressed CD4+ T cell markers. (L) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the differentially expressed CD4+ T cell markers. ns, not significant.
