caption: 'SS extract inhibits LPS-induced iNOS expression by inducing heme oxygenase-1.
  (a) Real-time analyses to determine changes in mRNA levels of LPS-induced Nos2 expression
  following treatment with the SS extract (SS). (b) Western blot analysis showing
  changes in the iNOS protein expression following the SS extract (SS) treatment.
  Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software. The bars represent the
  mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗: P < 0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗: P < 0.001 compared
  with the indicated group. SS, Sargassum siliquastrum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase.'
