caption: 'Identification of DCAF13 downstream targets by RNAseq. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering of gene expression profiles from three biologically independent samples
  based on Pearson correlation coefficient in wild‐type and DCAF13 knockout 4T07 cells.
  Blue to red signifies weak to strong correlation, respectively. TD1, TD2, and TD3:
  DCA13 knockout 4T07 cells; T1, T2, and T3: wild‐type 4T07 cells. (B) Gross overview
  of upregulated genes in wild‐type and DCAF13 knockout 4T07 cells. (C) Differential
  signaling pathway regulation in DCAF13 knockout 4T07 cells compared to wild‐type
  cells. (D) RT‐PCR analysis of the expression of significantly dysregulated genes
  in wild‐type and DCAF13 knockout 4T07 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SE (N = 3).
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.01, ****p < 0.001 (nonparametric test). (E) RT‐PCR
  analysis of the expression of ELK‐1, MMP13, SLC22A18, PERP, and p63 in wild‐type
  and DCAF13 knockout xenografts. (F) Immunofluorescence analysis of p‐H2AX, p‐CHK1,
  β‐catenin, and GOLPH2 (green) levels in wild‐type and DCAF13‐deficient 4T07 cells.
  Cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue)'
