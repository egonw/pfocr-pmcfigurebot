caption: 'Paired-related homeobox 1 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition via
  the WNT/β-catenin pathway. A: The protein levels of paired-related homeobox 1 (PRRX1),
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, Vimentin, and N-cadherin),
  total β-catenin and nuclear β-catenin in different groups of EC109 and EC9706 cells
  (treated with 10 μM XAV939) were examined using western blotting; B: The protein
  levels of the EMT markers total β-catenin nuclear β-catenin, and PRRX1 in different
  groups of EC109 PRRX1(i) and EC9706 PRRX1(i) cells (treated with 20 mmol/L LiCl)
  were examined using western blotting. aP < 0.05. PRRX1: Paired-related homeobox
