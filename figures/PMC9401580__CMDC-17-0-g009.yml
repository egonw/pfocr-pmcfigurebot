caption: General ABPP experiments for deconvolution of the mechanisms of artemisinin.
  A. Artemisinin‐alkyne probes are incubated with parasite‐infected cultures or other
  relevant Plasmodium proteomes. Iron‐mediated activation of the endoperoxide bridge
  generates radicals, which have been shown to be mostly secondary radicals. Extensive
  protein alkylation affects multiple essential pathways, overwhelms the parasite's
  protein repair systems, and leads to parasite death. B) Alkylated proteins were
  enriched with streptavidin after appending biotin to the probe‐protein complexes
  by click chemistry. Trypsinization of enriched proteins, followed by LC‐MS/MS analysis
  identified the alkylated proteins, which participate in essential parasite functions
  like antioxidant defense, the glycolytic pathway, DNA and protein synthesis, among
  others.
