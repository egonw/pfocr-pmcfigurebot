caption: 'The agile construction of a draft T-cell metabolic landscape across multiple
  organs from hECA(A) Workflow of the in data cell sorting from hECA to build the
  agile T cell atlas.(B) Subtypes of selected T cells are displayed on UMAP. DN T:
  Double negative T cell, CD8+ Tc: CD8+ Cytotoxic T cell, CD8+ Trm: CD8+ resident
  memory T cell, CD4+ Th1: CD4+ T helper cell type 1, CD4+ Tem: CD4+ effector memory
  T cell, CD4+ Tcm: CD4+ central memory T cell.(C) Organ origins of selected T cells
  organ origin displayed on UMAP.(D) Gene expression signatures of the identified
  T cell subtypes. The color bar represents average expression level of cell type
  related markers with colors gray to red indicating expression low to high. The dot
  size represents percentage of cells expressing the marker within subtypes.(E–F)
  Heatmaps showing z-scores of activity scores of major metabolic pathways of the
  T cell subtypes in multiple organs.(E) for CD4+ T cells and (F) for CD8+ T cells.
  Each row in the heatmap corresponds to one selected term in the KEGG metabolism
  pathway database, and each column corresponds to one T cell subcluster. See also  and
