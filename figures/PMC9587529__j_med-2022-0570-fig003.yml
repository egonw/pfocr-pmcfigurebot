caption: 'The regulatory role of CPSF7 on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in LUAD cells.
  A549 cells were stably transfected with si-CPSF7 or oe-CPSF7. The protein expression
  of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR was detected by Western blotting. Each experiment was
  repeated 3 times (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs Control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  vs si-NC + oe-NC.'
article_title: Silencing of CPSF7 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of lung adenocarcinoma cells by blocking the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
