caption: MA exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. (a)
  Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay in RAW264.7 cells treated with different
  concentrations of MA (0-500 mg/L) for 12 h, followed by 1 mg/L LPS stimulation for
  24 h. (b) qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, and IL-18 in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with 100 mg/L MA for 12 h, followed
  by stimulation with 1 mg/L LPS for 24 h. (c) Western blot was performed to detect
  the protein levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in RAW264.7 cells. (d) ELISA was conducted
  to detect the levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and
  IL-18 in RAW264.7 cells. Data are shown as mean ± SEM obtained from three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
