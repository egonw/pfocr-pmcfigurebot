caption: Effects of RES and MOS on cell viability and apoptosis in lung cancer cells
  (H23, H292, and A549) and normal cells (BEAS-2B). A total of 1 × 104 cells were
  seeded in 96-well plates and then treated with RES or MOS at the concentrations
  indicated in the figure for 24 h. (A) Cell viability of the cells was determined
  by MTT assay. (B) IC50 of three lung cancer cell lines and normal cells after 24 h
  of RES or MOS treatment. (C) The apoptotic cells were evaluated using Hoechst 33342/PI
  double staining. (D) Bar graphs showed the quantitative results of C. Each value
  is the mean (± SD) from triplicate experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 vs. control
