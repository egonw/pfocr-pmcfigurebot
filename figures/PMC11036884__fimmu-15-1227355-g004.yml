caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Functional pathway analysis of DEPs with
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Analyses were performed on proteomic data obtained
  from non-preconditioned microglia, 2 days after tMCAO (A1) and LPS-preconditioned
  microglia 2 days after tMCAO (A2). All DEPs (│log2 FC│≥ 0.58 and q-value ≤ 0.05)
  were submitted to the DAVID platform for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The subsequent
  list was filtered for pathways with a Fisher’s Exact p-value ≤ 0.05, which were
  considered to be significantly enriched. (As indicated, circle size represents the
  number of proteins associated with the respective enriched pathway, color scale
  specifies the level of significance. The experimental groups A1/A2_up/down, denoting
  the up-and downregulated groups from the single comparisons tMCAO vs. control and
  tMCAO_PC vs. control, and thereafter the protein lists derived from the Venn diagrams,
  are depicted on the x-axis).
