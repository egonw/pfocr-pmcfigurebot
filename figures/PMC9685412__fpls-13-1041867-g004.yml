caption: KPILP affects callose deposition around PD. Relative callose levels at PD
  as estimated by measurement of aniline blue-stained callose fluorescence intensity
  in N. benthamiana plants with PVX systemic infection and KPILP downregulation compared
  to the intact plants. The level callose in control plants was taken as 1. Mean values
  in arbitrary units (a.u.) and standard errors are presented. Bars without shared
  letters indicate significant differences at p<0.05 (ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD).
