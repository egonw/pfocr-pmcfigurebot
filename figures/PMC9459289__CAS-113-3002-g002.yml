caption: 'DEAD‐box helicase 55 (DDX55) regulates the PI3K/Akt/GSK‐3β/β‐catenin pathway
  by interacting with BRD4. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted “pathway
  in cancer” as one of the top ranked biological pathways associated with DDX55. NES,
  normalized enrichment scores; NOM p, nominal P‐value. (B) Transcriptome sequencing
  analysis of PIK3CA mRNA levels in the indicated Huh7 cells. (C) Western blotting
  (WB) analysis of active β‐catenin, β‐catenin, phosphorylated GSK‐3β (ser9), GSK‐3β,
  phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), total AKT, and PI3K (p110α) expression in the indicated
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Relative protein expression was normalized
  to β‐actin level, and phosphorylated proteins (p‐Akt and p‐GSK‐3β) were normalized
  to corresponding total protein (Akt and GSK‐3β). (D) The interaction between DDX55
  protein and BRD4 protein was revealed by the STRING database and identified by co‐immunoprecipitation
  assay with WB in reducing or non‐reducing conditions. (E) Six pairs of primers were
  designed within the PIK3CA promoter. (F) ChIP‐qPCR analysis suggested that BRD4
  and DDX55 co‐occupy the promoter region of PIK3CA (Primer 1: −481 ~ −166) in Huh7‐oeDDX55‐HA
  cells. (G) ChIP‐qPCR analysis suggested the enrichment of BRD4 on the promoter of
  PIK3CA (Primer 1: −481 ~ −166) could be significantly reduced by DDX55 knockdown
  in Huh7 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was evaluated
  by Student’s t test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001'
