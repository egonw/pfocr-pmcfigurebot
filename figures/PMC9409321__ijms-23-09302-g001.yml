caption: Transcriptome analysis of ZK3-KO cells versus reference cells. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering heat-map for DEGs of the ZK3-KO HCT116 and parental HCT116 cells. (B)
  GO analysis for biological processes. Red bars represent categories generated from
  upregulated genes, and blue bars are those from the downregulated genes. p-values
  are indicated. (C) Top 5 KEGG pathways in pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs.
  (D) STRING network analysis of cell cycle-associated genes classified by GO analysis.
  (E) Heat-map plot comparing the transcription levels of genes involved in the regulation
  of anaphase, based on the RNA sequencing results. GO, gene ontology; DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
