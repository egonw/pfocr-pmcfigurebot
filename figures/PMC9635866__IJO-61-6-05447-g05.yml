caption: Realgar-induced ferroptosis may be mediated via KRAS/Raf/MAPK. Realgar may
  be targeted to regulate Raf kinase, thereby further regulating the downstream JNK/ERK
  signaling cascade to suppress KRAS cells and exert an anticancer activity. At the
  same time, realgar inactivating GPX4, the ability of realgar to impair Xc- or suppress
  GSH synthesis can result in a buildup in the lipid peroxide levels and in an increase
  in ferroptotic cell death by targeting Raf-mediated Ras/MAPK pathway. Two enzymes,
  notably ACSL4, which are required for lipid remodeling, can convert PUFAs into PUFA-PEs.
  Created in BioRender.com. GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  GSH, glutathione; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.
