caption: Hydrogen peroxide is a relatively weak activator of the NRF2 pathway. (A)
  Cells transfected with the ARE luciferase reporter and a control reporter were treated
  for 18 h with sulforaphane (SFN) or H2O2 at the concentrations shown. Luciferase
  reporter activity in lysates is ARE reporter activity divided by control reporter
  activity, n = 4, then normalized to vehicle-treated cells. Where error bars are
  not shown, they are shorter than the height of the symbol. (B) Cells were treated
  for 2 h with SFN or H2O2 prior to harvest and Western blotting. Where indicated,
  cycloheximide (CHX) was included with SFN. Total protein analysis was performed
  by Fast Green staining. Images are representative of two biological replicates with
  two technical replicates each.
