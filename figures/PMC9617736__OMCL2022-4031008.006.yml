caption: 'PPI affected the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in LCSCs. (a) Western
  blotting was performed to compare the protein expression of β-catenin, NANOG, and
  OCT-4 in HCC cells and LCSCs. (b) PPI suppressed the protein expression of β-catenin,
  NANOG, and OCT-4 in LCSCs. (c) Immunofluorescence analysis was conducted to detect
  nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in PPI- and Sora-treated LCSCs. (d) A qPCR assay
  was conducted to examine the mRNA level of β-catenin in LCSCs after exposure to
  PPI. (e) β-catenin downregulation was triggered in the CHX group, while its degradation
  was remarkably facilitated in the CHX+PPI group. (f) The expression of β-catenin
  could not be downregulated by PPI whenMG132 was added. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01vs.
  the control group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01vs. the MG132 group. (g) Western blotting
  demonstrated that PPI administration notably affected the main proteins of the AKT/GSK-3/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. (h) Western blotting indicated that PPI reversed the promoting
  effect of LiCl on the β-catenin level. The expression of β-catenin in the LCSCs
  was further decreased by PPI in the presence of LY (the AKT inhibitor) treatment.
  Meanwhile, inhibition of β-catenin by PPI is rescued by SC79 (the Akt activator).
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01vs. the control group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01vs. the Sora
  group.'
