caption: 'SFL1 acts epistatically on FRQ in the regulatory pathway of microsclerotia
  formation. Microsclerotia production of V. dahliae wild-type (WT), FRQ and SFL1
  single-deletion strains (∆FRQ, ∆SFL1), ectopic complementation strains (FRQ-eC,
  SFL1-eC), and double-deletion strain (∆FRQ/∆SFL1) was analyzed. (a) A total of 50,000
  spores of the strains were point-inoculated onto SXM or CDM and incubated at 25
  °C in the light (left panel) or in the dark (right panel) for ten days. Top-view
  pictures of the colonies are shown. Of CDM cultures, the colony center without aerial
  hyphae, cross sections of colony centers, and microscopic views are depicted. The
  FRQ and SFL1 double-deletion strain grew similar to the SFL1 single-deletion strain.
  Black scale bars = 1 mm, blue scale bars = 100 µm. (b) A total of 50,000 spores
  were point-inoculated onto CDM and incubated at 25 °C for 14 days. Melanization
  of the colonies was quantified and WT was set to one. Two independent transformants
  (N = 2) of the deletion strains were tested, and one transformant (N = 1) was used
  for each of the complementation strains and wild-type. Mean values with standard
  deviation are depicted (N = 3–6). Significant differences compared with WT were
  calculated with t-tests and are indicated above the bars (n.s.: not significant,
  *: p < 0.05, ***: p < 0.001). The SFL1 single-deletion and FRQ/SFL1 double-deletion
  strains were significantly less melanized compared with wild-type.'
