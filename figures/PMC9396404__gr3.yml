caption: Insulin activates IRE1-XBP1s signaling in cultured hepatocytes. A, mice were
  subjected to a 24-h fast, then refed for 1.5 h, blood glucose levels (n = 5) and
  plasma insulin levels (n = 6 ∼ 7). B–E, Hepa1-6 cells were cultured in 4- or 25-mM
  glucose for 1 h, then treated with 10 nM insulin for 2 h. The protein levels of
  XBP1 and phosphorylation levels of mediators in the insulin signaling pathway and
  MEK-ERK-p38 signaling were determined (B). Densitometric analysis of the protein
  levels of XBP1s and XBP1u (C), phosphorylation levels of AKT, GSK, and IRE1 (D),
  and MEK, ERK, and p38 (E) (n = 3). F, primary hepatocytes were subjected to 3 h
  serum starvation, then treated with 10 nM of insulin for the indicated time. G,
  Hepa1-6 cells were subjected to 3-h serum starvation, then treated with 10 nM of
  insulin for the indicated time. ∗p < 0.05, Student’s t test. IRE1, inositol-requiring
  enzyme; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; XBP1u, XBP1 from an unspliced form; XBP1s,
  XBP1 from a spliced form.
