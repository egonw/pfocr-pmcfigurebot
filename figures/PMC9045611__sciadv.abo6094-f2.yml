figure_title: Biosynthetic pathway of aspernidine derivatives was activated during
  coculture of A. nidulans with E. dendrobii
caption: (A) Schematic representation of aspernidine gene cluster (pkf) in A. nidulans.
  pkfA, polyketide synthase; pkfB, cytochrome P450; pkfC, short-chain dehydrogenase;
  pkfD, hypothetical protein; pkfE, prenyltransferase; pkfF, choline dehydrogenase.
  (B) HPLC analysis of crude extracts of A. nidulans carrying the veA1 allele with
  or without E. dendrobii and cocultivation of Î”pkfA-mutant in the veA1-genotype background
  with E. dendrobii. UV absorptions at 210 nm are illustrated. (C) Quantitative real-time
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of pkfA-pkfF genes in A. nidulans carrying
  the veA1 allele during (I) monocultivation and (II) cocultivation with E. dendrobii.
article_title: Fungal-fungal cocultivation leads to widespread secondary metabolite
  alteration requiring the partial loss-of-function VeA1 protein.
