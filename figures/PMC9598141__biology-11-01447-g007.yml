caption: 'The ameliorative effect of D. salina on the liver inflammation induced by
  ZnO-NPs: (A,B) Representative photomicrographs of TNF-α immunohistochemistry of
  liver sections in the control and ZnO-NPs groups showing no positive reaction for
  TNF-α in the hepatocytes of the control group compared with the ZnO-NPs group; (C,D)
  representative photomicrographs of ZnD1, and ZnD2 groups showing weak expression
  of TNF-α (The brown color indicating TNF-α positively); (E) the mean cell number
  per unit area was quantified by NIH Image J. The results were normalized from three
  independent sections of the same area; (F) mRNA expression of genes involved in
  the (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. Scale magnifications were shown in pictures
  and data expressed as means ± SD. * p < 0.05 (significant), ** p < 0.01 (highly
  significant), *** p < 0.001 (very high significant).'
