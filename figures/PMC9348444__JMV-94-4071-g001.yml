caption: The SARS‐CoV‐2‐Spike protein mediates signaling transduction pathways. The
  diagram shows SARS‐CoV‐2‐Spike glycoprotein (S) interacts with several host cell
  receptor proteins mainly with ACE2 by its RBD region. TMPRSS2 initiates the activation
  of S protein for viral–host cell membrane fusion and subsequent internalization
  of viral particles inside the cell. SARS‐CoV‐2‐S and ACE2 interaction elicit NF‐κB
  signaling to regulate different cellular functions. S protein also shows the interaction
  with cytokine receptors (TLR‐1, 4, 6), glucose‐regulated protein (GRP78), mineralocorticoid
  receptor (MR), and important growth factor receptor‐neuropilin‐1 (NRP1). Apart from
  these, SARS‐CoV‐2‐Spike glycoprotein was shown to interact with dendritic cell‐specific
  intercellular adhesion molecule‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin (DC‐SIGN) for regulating
  different immunological functions in the host cell.
