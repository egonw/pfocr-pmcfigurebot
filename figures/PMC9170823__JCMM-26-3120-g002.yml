caption: Multiple therapeutic impacts of CTRP9 under IRI. (A) anti‐apoptotic signalling
  pathway of CTRP9 mediated by AdipoR‐1‐dependent and autocrine manners. AMPK and
  S1P are two critical regulators of the CTRP9‐related signalling pathway to exert
  cardioprotective and anti‐apoptotic effects. (B) CTRP9 also represents an autophagy
  modulatory effect under different stress conditions, for example short and long‐term
  IRI. (C) anti‐inflammatory effect of CTRP9 by targeting pro‐inflammatory cytokines,
  NADPH oxidase subtypes and immune cells
