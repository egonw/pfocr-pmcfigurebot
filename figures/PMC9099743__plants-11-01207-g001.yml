caption: 'A simplified putative diagram view of fatty acids biosynthetic pathway in
  Perilla and triacylglycerols (TAGs) assembly. The schematic view involved bio-chemical
  interactions occurring in plastid, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.
  The resulting TAGs are indicated in yellow. Purple circles indicate transcription
  factors, including WRINKLED (WRI1), FUSCA3 (FUS3), LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1, LCE2),
  and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3). The transcriptional regulation of FUS3, LCE1,
  LCE2, and ABI3 with PfFAD3.1 is not yet uncovered. PDHC: plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; ACCase: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; MCMT: malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase; KASIII:
  ketoacyl-ACP synthase type III; KAR: 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD: 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dyhydratase; EAR: 2-enoyl-ACP reductase; KASII: ketoacyl-ACP synthase type II; KASI:
  ketoacyl-ACP synthase type I; SAD: stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase; FATB:
  acyl-ACP thioesterase B; FATA: acyl-ACP thioesterase A; MGDG: monogalactosyldiacylglycerol;
  PfFAD: Perilla frutescens fatty acid desaturase; PC Pool: phosphatidylcholines pool;
  PCH: palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase; LACS: long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; PDCT: phosphatidylcholinediacylglycerol
  cholinephosphotransferase; FAX: fatty acid export; LPCAT: lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase; PDAT: phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase; DGAT: diacylglycerolacyltransferase;
  GPAT: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT: 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase;
  DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PAH: phosphatidic acid phosphatase; OLEO: Oleosin.'
