figure_title: An overview of the IFN-γ signalling pathway
caption: The IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR), a heterodimer of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, is expressed
  on the surface of almost all cell types. After IFN-γ binds to IFNGR, it induces
  the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 while EHBP1L1 is responsible for
  stabilising JAK1. These then phosphorylate tyrosine 701 (Try701) of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 to induce homodimer formation. STAT1 dimers
  enter the nucleus and bind to the IFN-γ activated sites (GASs) of target genes to
  initiate their transcription. A principal target is the transcription factor IRF1,
  which activates expression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally,
  IFN-γ stimulates the phosphoinositide-3-kinase–protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathway,
  which is also required for the full activation of STAT1 in the canonical pathway.
  Suppressor of cytokine signalling 1/3 (SOCS1/3), LNK, and PTPN2 are responsible
  for acting as feedback inhibitors, deactivating JAK1/2, to maintain homeostasis
  of IFN-γ signalling (Created with BioRender.com).
