caption: Effects of PLD1 on the biological characteristics of CASKI cells. (A) The
  CCK‐8 assay growth curves showed that the proliferation activity of PC‐11 and PC‐40
  cells was significantly inhibited in comparison to that of WT‐CASKI cells. (B) In
  the Matrigel migration/invasion assays, PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells demonstrated a significantly
  weaker ability to migrate and invade than WT‐CASKI cells (both p < 0.001). (C) For
  the scratch assays, PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells had significantly lower migration area
  percentages than WT‐CASKI cells (32.55 ± 1.68% and 35.62 ± 4.02% vs. 67.01 ± 4.69%,
  both p < 0.001) (D) Colony formation assays showed that the colony formation rate
  of PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells were both significantly reduced (43.93 ± 2.11% and 46.47 ± 3.28%
  vs. 82.00 ± 2.54%; all p < 0.01, respectively). In addition, the colonies formed
  by PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells were thinner than those formed by WT‐CASKI cells. (E) PC‐11
  and PC‐40 cells exhibited higher sensitivity to cisplatin and the IC50 values significantly
  decreased in comparison with WT‐CASKI cells (22.25 ± 3.52 μg/mL and 18.12 ± 2.72 μg/mL
  vs. 52.45 ± 5.67 μg/mL, p = 0.0014 and 0.0007, respectively). (F, G) Western blot
  and immunocytochemistry results showed that vimentin was poorly expressed, whereas
  E‐cadherin was highly expressed in PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
