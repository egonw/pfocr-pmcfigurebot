caption: The entire heat map showing intracellular levels of metabolites in T24GR
  cells transfected with NTC and IDH2. For each cell line, four independently derived
  cell lines are shown, and the levels were normalized to those in WT cells.PPP metabolite
  levels in T24GR cells transfected with siIDH2 compared with GR cells transfected
  with NTC based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs
  (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01.The intermediate metabolite levels of the TCA cycle in T24GR cells transfected
  with NTC and siIDH2 based on targeted CE‐MS/MS metabolomics. The data are shown
  as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's
  t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Levels of endpoint metabolites of the purine and pyrimidine
  synthesis pathway in GR cells relative to those in WT cells as determined by CE‐MS
  metabolomics. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05. n.s., non‐significant.The levels
  of +5 metabolites and +4 metabolites, including early metabolites and late metabolites,
  in the TCA cycle compared between T24GR cells transfected with NTC and those transfected
  with siIDH2. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05.13C enrichment in cellular citrate
  and malate between T24GR cells transfected with NTC and those transfected with siIDH2
  as determined by CE‐MS; the levels were normalized to the total pool size of the
  relevant metabolite. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological
  replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05.
