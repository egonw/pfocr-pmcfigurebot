caption: 'TF3 activates the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling and the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathways
  in chondrocytes stimulated with erastin. (a) The levels of Nrf2, Keap1, p-MEK1/2,
  MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in chondrocytes after stimulation were examined by
  western blotting; representative bands are shown. (b) Quantitative analysis for
  the expression of Nrf2, Keap-1, p-MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in chondrocytes. (c) The
  nucleus and cytoplasm expression levels of Nrf2 in chondrocytes were determined
  by western blotting; representative bands are shown. (d) Quantitative analysis for
  the nucleus and cytoplasm expression levels of Nrf2. The human lamin B and β-actin
  antibodies were used as the internal controls for nucleus and cytoplasm protein
  loading, respectively. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments, and statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. ∗p <
  0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. NC: chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM-F12 for 24 hrs. Erastin:
  chondrocytes were treated with 5 μM erastin for 24 hrs. Erastin+15TF3/Erastin+30TF3:
  chondrocytes were pretreated with different concentrations of TF3 (15 μM, 30 μM)
  and then incubated with erastin. Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
