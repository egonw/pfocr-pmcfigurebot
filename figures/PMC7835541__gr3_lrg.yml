caption: The relevant signaling pathway network and its key role of MXSGD against
  COVID-19. (A) Pathway to pathway network. Each circle represents a signaling pathway,
  the larger the circle, the more connected pathways. (B) JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  affects 3 important downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling pathway,
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and Apoptosis signaling pathway).
