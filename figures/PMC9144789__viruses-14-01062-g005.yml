caption: The regulatory effects between LvIFI6-16 and LvIRF, LvJAK, LvSTAT, or apoptosis-related
  genes before and after WSSV infection. (a) The transcription level of LvIFI6-16
  in gills was regulated by LvIRF. (b) The transcription level of LvIFI6-16 in gills
  was regulated by LvSTAT. The internal control was LvEF-1α. Samples were taken at
  48 h after dsLvIRF, dsLvSTAT, and dsGFP (as a control) injection. Bars indicated
  the mean ± SD of three samples and statistical significances were calculated by
  the Student’s t-test (** p < 0.01). (c) Transcription levels of apoptosis-related
  genes in gills of LvIFI6-16-knockdown shrimps. The internal control was LvEF-1α.
  Samples were taken at 48 h after injection with indicated dsRNA. Bars indicated
  the mean ± SD of three samples and statistical significances were calculated by
  the Student’s t-test (** p < 0.01; NS, not significant). (d) Transcription levels
  of apoptosis-related genes in gills of LvIFI6-16-knockdown shrimps after WSSV challenge.
  The internal control was LvEF-1α. Shrimps were injected with dsRNA of LvIFI6-16;
  after that, shrimp were infected with WSSV and samples were taken 48 h after WSSV
  infection. Bars indicated the mean ± SD of three samples and statistical significances
  were calculated by the Student’s t-test (** p < 0.01; NS, not significant). (e)
  LvIFI6-16 regulated the expression of LvJAK and LvSTAT in gills during WSSV infection.
  Samples were taken as described to (d). (f) A possible model of the LvIFI6-16 involving
  signaling regulation in response to WSSV infection. Pathogenic infection such as
  WSSV induced the activation of the IRF–JAK/STAT axis that triggered the expression
  of LvIFI6-16, which then resulted in the induction of several caspases that conferred
  antiviral apoptosis against WSSV. In addition, there could be a feedback regulatory
  loop mediated by LvIFI6-16 and JAK/STAT pathway. Bars indicated the mean ± SD of
  three samples and statistical significances were calculated by the Student’s t-test
  (** p < 0.01). Experiments were performed three times with similar results.
