figure_title: 'The mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α following DEX and LPS co-treatment
  of WISH cells was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Relative mRNA level
  was normalized to that of β-actin and presented as mean ± standard deviation of
  three independent experiments. #P < 0.05 versus control group; *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01 versus LPS group. DEX, dexmedetomidine; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  mRNA, messenger ribonucleic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor'
