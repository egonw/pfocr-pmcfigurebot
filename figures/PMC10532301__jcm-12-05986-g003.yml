caption: Heatmap plot of significant KEGG pathways for 7 miRNAs. Rows represent the
  enrichment results for the targets of the 7 miRNAs. Columns represent all KEGG pathways
  that are significant for the different miRNAs. The color of individual fields represents
  the âˆ’log10-transformed p-value of the respective enrichment results. Darker colors
  indicate more significant associations between miRNA and target pathway.
