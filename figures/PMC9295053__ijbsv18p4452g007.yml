caption: The overall effects of GAC acetylation on cell metabolism and cancer-related
  pathways. A-K Metabolomics analysis showed the relative levels of various metabolites
  in A549-GACWT and A549-GACK311Q stable cells. L Pathway analysis of decreased metabolites
  in A549-GACK311Q stable cells was shown. Data are showed as mean Â± SD, n=3. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01.
