caption: Schematic diagram explaining natriuretic peptides (NPs)—mediated anti-hypertensive
  effects via baroreflex afferent pathway. This study confirmed that microinjection
  of NPs in the nodose ganglion (NG) can lower blood pressure under both physiological
  and pathophysiological status. Meanwhile, exogenous NPs can perform baroreceptor
  sensitivity (BRS) improvement effect. These anti-hypertensive functions and the
  expression of natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) were closely related to estrogen.
  Abnormal expression of NPs and its receptors in nodose ganglion (NG) and nucleus
  tractus solitarius (NTS) in models of hypertension with metabolic disorders suggests
  a negative feedback regulation.
