caption: 'The HGF/MET signaling pathway activates Nanog expression in CD44v6+ HCC
  cells. (a) Silencing Met decreased the expression of stemness relative genes, including
  Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog in CD44v6+ SNU-398 cells. β-Actin was used as a normalized
  control. (b) The expression of EMT-related genes, including Snail1, Slug, and Twist
  in CD44v6+ SNU-398 cells. β-Actin was used as a normalized control. (c) Western
  blot showed that silencing Met decreased the expression of Nanog in CD44v6+ cells.
  But LvNanog did not affect the Met expression. β-Actin was used as a normalized
  control. (d) 1 × 105 of cells were injected into the left lobes of the liver. Bioluminescence
  signals from Met shRNA groups were weaker than that from corresponding control groups.
  But overexpressed Nanog could rescue the bioluminescence signals. The central luminescence
  intensity: 8.8e + 7 vs. 1.6e + 6; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; t-test. The representative
  images of Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Scale bar, 50 μm. (e) The representative images
  of spheres and histogram analysis in indicated cells. Scale bar, 200 μm. (f) and
  (g) transwell migration and invasion assays showed the knockdown of Met decreased
  the migration and invasion of CD44v6+ cells, while overexpressed Nanog could rescue
  the migration and invasion ability. Scale bar, 200 μm. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001; t-test.'
