caption: Partial reprogramming promotes phenotypes associated with aging in degenerative
  nucleus pulposus cells. (a,b) Immunofluorescence intensity of Oct4 (a) and Sox2
  (b) in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment. Scale bar, 25 μm. (c) Cultured
  primary 4F aging NPCs were treated with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 2 days (dox2d)
  and 4 days (dox4d), then the levels of sox9 were determined by Western blotting.
  (d) Light microscope (LM) and β‐galactosidase activity in aging, dox2d, and dox4d
  samples. LM, scale bar, 100 μm; β‐galactosidase staining, scale bar, 50 μm. (e–h)
  qPCR analysis of stress response genes in the p53 pathway in 4F aging NPCs after
  doxycycline treatment. (i–k) qPCR analysis of senescence‐associated catabolism index
  MMP13, ADAMTS5, and anabolism index COL2 in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment.
  (l–n) Immunofluorescence intensity of γH2AX, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3 in 4F aging NPCs
  after doxycycline treatment. Scale bar, 25 μm. (o–q) Quantification of γH2AX, H3K9me3,
  and H4K20me3 levels in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment. Scale bar, 25 μm.
  (r) ROS levels in 4F aging NPCs after doxycycline treatment. (s) Proliferation of
  aging NPCs cultured in inducing OSKM lasting 2 or 4 days as determined by EdU incorporation.
