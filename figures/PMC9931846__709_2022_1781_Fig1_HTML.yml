caption: Schematic representation of terpene indole alkaloid (TIA) biosynthetic pathway
  of Catharanthus roseus. The early TIA pathway extends across the seco-iridoid pathway
  (terpene moiety) and the shikimate pathway (indole moiety). The late TIA pathway
  refers to all downstream synthesis steps from the condensation of secologanin and
  tryptamine to form central TIA precursor strictosidine. This is followed by the
  catharanthine and vindoline biosynthesis pathway. Finally, coupling of vindoline
  and catharanthine leads to production of vinblastine and vincristine through the
  vinblastine-vincristine pathway. Solid arrows indicate direct enzymatic reaction
  and broken arrows represent multiple or uncharacterized reactions. G10H, geraniol
  10-hydroxylase; SLS, secologanin synthase; AS, anthranilate synthase; TDC, tryptophan
  decarboxylase; STR, strictosidine synthase; SGD, strictosidine-Î²-glucosidase; T16H,
  tabersonine16 hydroxylase (both the isoforms T16H1 and T16H2); 16-OMT, 16-hydroxytabersonine
  16-O-methyltransferase; T3O, tabersonine-3-oxygenase; T3R, tabersonine 3-reductase;
  NMT, N-methyltransferase; D4H, deacetoxyvindoline-4-hydroxylase; DAT, deacetylvindoline-4-O-acetyltransferase;
  PRX1, peroxidase 1/anhydrovinblastine synthase
