caption: ACSL4 is required for HK2‐maintained liver CSC stemness. a) Correlation assay
  of RNA‐seq results of HUH7 cells after transfection with two independent HK2 siRNAs.
  b) Comparison of the genes with downregulated expression from the RNA‐seq results
  of HUH7 cells transfected with two independent HK2 siRNAs versus negative control
  (NC). A total of 412 genes showed downregulated expression in two independent HK2
  siRNA‐transfected HUH7 cell lines. c) KEGG pathway analysis of the 412 genes on
  the DAVID website. d) Analysis of the embryonic stem cell‐like gene expression signature
  (ES score) of fatty acid metabolism‐ and fatty acid degradation‐related genes. Red
  dots show the positively correlated genes with a p value < 0.05 and score > 0. e)
  Tumorsphere formation assay of HUH7 and C3A cells after transfection with NC, ACSL3,
  ACSL4, FADS1, and FADS2 siRNAs. Additionally, see the photographs in Figure  (Supporting
  Information). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2). One‐way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons correction. f) Real‐time qPCR showing ACSL4 mRNA expression
  (relative to ACTB) in adherent cells and tumorspheres of HUH7 and C3A cells. Data
  are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Unpaired t‐test. g) Western blots measuring
  ACSL4 protein levels in adherent cells (Adh.) and tumorspheres (TS) of HUH7 and
  C3A cells. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. h) Real‐time qPCR showing ACSL4
  mRNA expression (relative to ACTB) in HUH7 and C3A cells after HK2 knockdown or
  HK2 overexpression. Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). One‐way ANOVA
  with multiple comparisons correction. i) Western blots measuring ACSL4 and HK2 protein
  levels in HUH7 and C3A cells after HK2 knockdown and HK2 overexpression, respectively.
  ACTIN was detected as a loading control. j) Tumorsphere formation assay of HuH7
  and C3A cells after HK2 overexpression and ACSL4 knockdown (left) and HK2 knockdown
  and ACSL4 overexpression (right). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 2).
  One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. ns, non‐significant, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
