caption: 'PIs inhibit XR-elevated mTORC1 signaling via stabilizing DEPTOR(A) Western
  blot analysis of the levels of mTORC1 signaling pathway components and regulators
  in FaDu and Detroit 562 cells treated with PIs (DMSO as vehicle control) plus XR
  (NR as control) as in B. (B, D–F, H) FaDu cells were treated with PT33 (20 nM),
  BTZ (10 nM), rapamycin (RAPA, 100 nM), or PT33 (20 nM) + rapamycin (100 nM) for
  12 h (DMSO as vehicle control) and subsequently exposed to XR (6-Gy). (B) Western
  blot analysis of DEPTOR levels in FaDu and Detroit 562 cells treated with BTZ (top)
  or PT33 (bottom), followed by XR for indicated times. (Left) Representative images;
  (right) DEPTOR grayscale intensity normalized to GAPDH at the indicated times after
  XR treatment. (C) Western blot analysis of the DEPTOR levels in FaDu and Detroit
  562 cells, at 2 h with CHX (50 μM) and PT33 (20 nM) treatment, subsequently exposed
  to XR, and collected cell lysis for the indicated times. (Left) Representative images.
  (Right) DEPTOR grayscale intensity normalized to GAPDH at indicated times after
  XR treatment. (D and E) Co-IP and Western blot analyses for detecting the K48-linked
  polyubiquitinated levels of DEPTOR. (D) Cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin
  (K48-specific) and FLAG-DEPTOR followed by XR treatment, and collected cell lysis
  for the indicated times. IP with FLAG, IB with HA. (E) Cells were transfected with
  HA-ubiquitin (K48 specific) followed by XR treatment, and collected cell lysis for
  the indicated times. IP with HA, IB with endogenous DEPTOR. (F) Co-IP and Western
  blot analyses of the interaction between β-TrCP/CKI/mTOR and DEPTOR in FLAG-DEPTOR
  or Myc-β-TrCP overexpression cells treated with XR, and collected cell lysis for
  6 h, NR as control. (G) 2D adherent colony formation assays in DEPTOR-KO and TSC2-KO
  cells exposed to a single 3- or 6-Gy dose of XR (mock or NC cells were used as control).
  (Top) Cell survival rates. (Bottom) The ratio of DEPTOR-KO or TSC2-KO to NC colony
  number. (H) Western blot analysis of the levels of mTORC1 signaling pathway components
  in DEPTOR-KO and TSC2-KO cells pretreated with BTZ, PT33, or rapamycin and subsequently
  exposed to XR, and collected cell lysis for 6 h. (I) 2D adherent colony formation
  assays for cell survival rate in DEPTOR-KO or WT FaDu cells pretreated with PT33
  (10 nM), and consequently exposed to a single 3-Gy dose of XR treatment. (J) Cell
  viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration
  (IC50) values were calculated in DEPTOR-KO or WT FaDu cells treated with PT33 plus
  XR-3Gy (NR as control). All statistical data are presented as means ± SDs (n = 3;
  B, G, and J: 1-way ANOVA; C and I: 2-sample t test). ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; N.S., not significant.'
