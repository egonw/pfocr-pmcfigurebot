caption: Inflammasome signaling pathway was downregulated by OLA in murine peritoneal
  macrophages. (A) NLRP3, (B) ASC, (C) IL-18, (D) pro-caspase-11, partially cleaved
  and cleaved, (E) pro-caspase-1 and cleaved-caspase-1. Protein expressions were analyzed
  by immunoblot. Murine peritoneal macrophages were pretreated for 30 min with OLA
  (25 and 12.5μM) followed by stimulation with 5 μg/mL LPS for 18 h. Densitometry
  was performed following normalization to the control (β-actin housekeeping gene).
  Data are represented as the means ± SEM (n = 6). + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01, +++ p
  < 0.001 vs. control cells (no stimulated); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  vs. LPS−DMSO-treated cells.
