caption: The DIO3OS silence inhibited osteosarcoma cell metastasis in vivo. A Images
  of BALB/C nude mice injected SaoS-2 cell treated with si-NC and si-DIO3OS via tail
  vein. B Images of lung tissue from BALB/C nude mice injected SaoS-2 cell treated
  with si-NC and si-DIO3OS via tail vein. C Weight of lung from si-DIO3OS group was
  significant lower than si-NC group. D Number of metastatic nodules in lung from
  si-DIO3OS was significant lower than si-NC group. E The expression of DIO3OS in
  two groups of mice using qRT-PCR. F The expression levels of E-cad were up-regulated
  in si-DI3OS group. G The expression levels of Vimentin were suppressed in si-DI3OS
  group. H Western blotting analysis of E-cad, Vimentin, p-SMAD2 and SMAD2 in two
  groups of mice. P-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant
  (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001)
