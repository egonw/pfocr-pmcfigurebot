figure_title: CDM-dependent CAFs generate sEVs with unique protein cargo
caption: '(A) Representative transmission electron micrograph of sEVs isolated from
  CM collected from human pancreatic CAFs cultured within a CDM. Red box highlights
  a structure with canonical exosome morphology and size. Scale bar = 100 nm. (B)
  Representative western blot of CAF lysate and assorted fractions collected following
  differential ultracentrifugation probing for enrichment of sEV markers. Lysate corresponding
  to 5 μg protein obtained from the EV-generating CAFs served as loading control.
  Fractions shown are: large EVs pellet (from the 10,000 × g centrifuge step); sEV
  supernatant; and sEV pelleted (collected from the 120,000 × g centrifuge step (see  for
  details). Note that the sEV pellet is enriched with canonical exosome markers and
  lacks organelle contaminants. (C) Representative Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
  (NTA) histogram of an sEV pellet fraction; using the NanoSight platform. (D) Control
  western blot showing sEVs isolated from media containing FBS (+FBS) and undetected
  in serum-depleted (-FBS) media. (E) Enriched gene ontology clusters from proteomic
  analysis of CDM-producing human CAF isolated sEVs, n=3. Note that full proteomics
  and enriched pathway analysis can be found in  (Tabs=Total proteins CAF.sEV,  Pathway
  Analysis)'
