caption: 'RNA sequencing supports upregulation of signaling via the PI-3-K/AKT pathway,
  the MAPK pathway and G-proteins in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
  (A) Heatmap showing 3,162 differentially expressed genes (1,716 upregulated, 1,446
  downregulated, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.01) in primary cutaneous anaplastic
  large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) when compared to CD4+ T cells. (B) Heatmap showing
  expression of genes with diagnostic and/or pathogenic relevance in pcALCL identified
  in prior studies. RNA sequencing confirmed the upregulation of several markers and
  oncogenes that characterize this lymphoma. (C) Heatmap showing (proto)-oncogenes
  (Proto-OG) and tumor suppressors (TSG) deregulated in pcALCL which are involved
  in the PI-3-K/AKT pathway and the MAPK pathway. (D) Upregulated cellular processes/pathways
  in pcALCL as determined by gene set pathway analysis with GeneAnalytics. (E) Downregulated
  cellular processes/pathways in pcALCL as determined by gene set pathway analysis
  with GeneAnalytics. (F) Top three human kinases for which known co-expressed genes
  were overrepresented in the transcriptome of pcALCL. (G) Validation of DDR2 and
  PDGFRB upregulation in pcALCL by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction (RT-qPCR). (H) Validation of GPS2 and PIK3R1 downregulation in pcALCL by
  RT-qPCR. (*P<0.05, ****P<0.0001); pcALCL (n=12), BID (n=8), HC (n=4). BID: benign
  inflammatory dermatoses; HC: healthy CD4+ T cells.'
