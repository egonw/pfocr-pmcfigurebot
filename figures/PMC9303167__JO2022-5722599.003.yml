caption: Immune landscape and functional annotation of different necroptotic subtypes.
  (a) Survival analysis of different necroptotic subtypes in the combined CM cohort.
  The K-M curves with a P value less than 0.001 suggested that the differences in
  survival were significant across the three clusters. Immune cluster A displayed
  superior survival compared with the other subtypes. (b) PCAs for transcriptome profile
  of necroptotic subtypes, suggesting an obvious distinction in the transcriptome
  among different subtypes. (c) Unsupervised clustering of the genes related to necroptosis
  in the combined CM cohort. Necroptosis cluster, age, and status of survival served
  as patients' annotation. Red means high levels, and blue means levels. (d), (e)
  GSVA enrichment analyses of the activated signaling pathways in three different
  necroptosis clusters. Red color means the activation of the signaling pathway, and
  blue means the inhibition of the signaling pathway. (f) Variations in the abundance
  of infiltrating immune cells among necroptosis clusters A, B, and C using “ssGSEA.”
  “∗” represents the statistical P value (∗P value less than 0.05; ∗∗P value less
  than 0.01; ∗∗∗P value less than 0.001). (g) Difference in the abundance of infiltrating
  immune cells among necroptosis clusters A, B, and C using “CIBERSORT” analysis.
  “∗” represents the statistical P value (∗P value less than 0.05; ∗∗P value less
  than 0.01; ∗∗∗P value less than 0.001). (h) The expression of immune checkpoint
  genes in three necroptosis clusters.
