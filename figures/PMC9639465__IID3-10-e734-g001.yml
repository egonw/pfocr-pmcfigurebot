caption: 'Etanercept inhibits the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway of psoriasis model mice.
  (A/B) The protein expression of p‐JAK, JAK, p‐STAT3, and STAT3 was detected by western
  blot. (C/D) The protein expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 was detected by western blot.
  *p < .05 compares with Control group; #p < .05 compared with Model group.'
