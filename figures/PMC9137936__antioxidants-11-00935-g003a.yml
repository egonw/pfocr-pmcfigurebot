caption: After 56 days of diet supplemented with VC, the expression levels of Nrf2
  and Keap1 protein (A) and the expression of related genes (B) involved in antioxidant
  the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in the liver of gibel carp were altered between the normal
  and hypoxia groups. The * or ** at the top of the bar chart indicate significant
  differences between treatments; * indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05),
  and ** indicates an extremely significant difference (p < 0.01). All of the data
  are presented as the mean ± standard error (n = 6). hsp70—heat shock protein 70;
  cat—catalase; sod—superoxide dismutase; gpx—glutathione peroxidase.
