caption: RT-PCR for the relative mRNA expression of treated HL60 treated with compound
  (4) (IC50 = 8.09 μM, 48 h, A) and HepG2 cells treated with compound (8b) (IC50 =
  13.14 μM, 48 h, B) versus β-actin as a housekeeping gene (fold change of the untreated
  control = 1). The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
