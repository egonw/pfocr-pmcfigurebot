caption: 'IL-22 antagonized the apoptosis induced by antitumor drugs on human lung
  NSCLC cells. PC-9 (a) was incubated with gefitinib (5 μmol/L) and IL-22 (0, 5, 10,
  50, and 100 ng/mL) for 48 hours, while A549 (b) was incubated with cisplatin (10 μmol/L)
  and IL-22 (the same concentrations as PC-9) for 48 hours. Both cell lines were harvested,
  and the cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The data was presented as
  the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of triplicate samples. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, when compared to the control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and
  ###P < 0.001, when compared to the low concentration group.'
