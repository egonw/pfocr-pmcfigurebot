caption: PD-L1 limits liver injury in NAFLD models. (a and b) Western blot determined
  the effect of siRNA against PD-L1. (c) After PD-L1 knockdown, mRNA expression levels
  of markers of T cell activation measured by qRT-PCR. (d and e) Hepatocyte injury
  was evaluated by the Tunel assay and ALT/AST measurement. (f) Graph illustrating
  that both ROS/ZNF24 pathway activation and UBE2I-mediated ZNF24 sumoylation suppression
  induced by FFA promoted PD-L1 expression. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
