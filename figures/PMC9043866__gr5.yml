caption: TAZ rescued the defects in mtDNA copy number, mPTP opening, and cytochrome
  c release(A) TAZ counteracted the aberration in mtDNA copy number through Nrf2.
  After introduction of the TAZ overexpression plasmid, mtDNA copy number was analyzed
  in the absence or presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 in the context of LPS. N =
  5. (B and C) TAZ prevented opening of the mPTP via Nrf2, as seen by flow cytometry
  or confocal microscopy. N = 3. (D) TAZ impeded release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
  into the cytosol via Nrf2. After co-transfection with the TAZ overexpression plasmid
  and the pCytochrome c-GFP vector, BV2 microglial cells were incubated with TMRM
  in the absence or presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and stained with Hoechst
  33342, followed by visualization under confocal microscopy. N = 3. Cyt C, cytochrome
  c.
