caption: 'Heatmap of significantly enriched GO terms in DS: Comparisons are shown
  on the X axis with GO terms on the Y axis. When performing tests for enrichment,
  terms were restricted to include only those with 2 or more genes. Note that for
  the purposes of display, only GO terms with an enrichment p-value less than 0.05,
  were included. Furthermore, only the top 50 terms are displayed. Color is assigned
  based on the -log10(enrichment p-value), with lighter colors implying less significant
  enrichment. Hierarchical clustering was applied to terms (rows). The most significant
  terms were clustered according to Euclidean distance using the complete linkage
  method. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
  reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
