caption: MELNs did not significantly reduce the viability of hepatocytes and reduced
  the oxidative stress level after Glcn-induced insulin resistance. (A)-(B) CCK8 assay
  was used to determine the effect of MELN on the cell viability of normal hepatocytes
  and GlcN (+) hepatocytes. (C)-(D) Parameters of hepatocyte function. (E)-(G) Changes
  of intracellular ROS in GlcN (+) hepatocytes treated with MELN. **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05
  compared to the GlcN (+) hepatocytes
