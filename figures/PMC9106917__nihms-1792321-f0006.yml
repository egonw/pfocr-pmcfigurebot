figure_title: ILC1-derived IFN-γ inhibits LSC differentiation via JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT
  signaling
caption: a, Mouse LSCs were co-cultured with or without ILC1s or IFN-γ for 3 days.
  LSCs were separated from co-cultured ILC1s using FACS before RNA-seq. Heatmap showing
  RNA differential expression of the top 20 upregulated and downregulated genes (n
  = 3 individual mice). b, Hallmark pathway analysis in LSC RNA pools (ILC1-treated
  vs. untreated Ctrl). Left panel shows signaling pathways downregulated in LSCs.
  Right panel shows signaling pathways upregulated in LSCs (n = 3 individual mice).
  c, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) plots showing enrichment of selected target
  genes in LSCs co-cultured with ILC1s. The rank orders (ILC1 vs. Ctrl) of all the
  genes (n = 3 individual mice) are shown on the X-axis. d-f, Differential expression
  of RNA from Akt3 (d), Jak2 (e), and Stat1, and Stat2 (f) genes. Results are expressed
  as means compared with the Ctrl (n = 3 individual mice). g-k, Mouse LSCs were treated
  with or without the indicated JAK and AKT inhibitors for 30 min and then co-cultured
  with or without WT or IFN-γ−/− ILC1s in the presence of IL-12 plus IL-15 for 3 days.
  Representative flow cytometry plots (g) and statistics of absolute cell numbers
  (h-k) of Lin− Sca-1+c-Kit+, Lin− Sca-1− c-Kit+, Lin− Sca-1+c-Kit−, and Lin−Sca-1−c-Kit−
  cells are shown (n = 3 individual mice). Data in g, h, i, j, and k are representative
  of three independent experiments and are presented as mean ± s.d. and were assessed
  by one-way ANOVA models. NS, not significant.
