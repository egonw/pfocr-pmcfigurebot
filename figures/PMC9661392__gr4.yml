caption: Overexpression of TMEM100 inhibits the cell cycle and apoptosis of PCa cells
  and regulate FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (A) Effects of TMEM100 overexpression
  on cell cycle by flow cytometry in DU145 and PC3 cells. (B) Effects of TMEM100 overexpression
  on cell apoptosis by flow cytometry in DU145 and PC3 cells. (C) Changes in the apoptotic
  and cell cycle-related proteins were detected by Western blot in DU145 and PC3 cells.
  (D) The analysis results of enrichment of KEEG pathway. (E) Changes in the FAK/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot in DU145 and PC3 cells.
  (F) The qualification of apoptotic and cell cycle-related proteins by densitometry
  (G) The qualification of FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway proteins by densitometry.
