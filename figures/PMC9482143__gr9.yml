caption: Schematic illustrating the effects of FGF7 alleviates myocardial infarction
  by decreasing oxidative stress via PI3Kα/AKT mediated regulation of Nrf2 and HXK2.
  In the condition of myocardial infarction, the function of mitochondrial was disrupted,
  and produces large amounts of ROS to cause cell apoptosis. FGF7 attenuated myocardial
  infarction via promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and mitochondrial HXK2 localization
  via PI3Kα/AKT signaling pathway to scavenge excessive ROS and inhibit the production
  of ROS to against cell apoptosis ultimately.
