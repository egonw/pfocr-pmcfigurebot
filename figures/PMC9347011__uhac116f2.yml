caption: Effects of ASA treatment on expression of ethylene biosynthetic pathway genes
  and recombinant protein activities of five candidate genes. (A) Fruit disks were
  treated with 0.5 mM ASA or control (CK) at 28°C for 6 hours. The comparisons were
  made with three replicates at each point. The enzyme names in red are differentially
  expressed gene families in transcriptome data; enzyme names in black are gene families
  not responding to ASA. Five candidate ethylene biosynthetic genes—AdACS1/2/3 (Achn364251/Acc05955,
  Achn339101/Acc30932 and Achn189421/Acc15646) and AdACO3/5 (Achn326461/Acc20538 and
  Achn157111/Acc13619), highlighted by red boxes—were used for further investigation.
  (B) Recombinant protein activities of five candidate ethylene biosynthetic structural
  genes presented in the form of ethylene production. Error bars indicate standard
  errors from three replicates.
