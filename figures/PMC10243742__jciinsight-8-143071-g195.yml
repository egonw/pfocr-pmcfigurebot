figure_title: NCL induces regulation of angiogenic pathways and promotes phosphorylation
  of VEGFR2 in HCMECs
caption: '(A and B) Heatmap showing the expression of the top 15 genes driving the
  enrichment of “angiogenesis” pathways in HCMECNCLKD and the top 50 genes driving
  the enrichment of “oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis” pathways in HCMECControlKD.
  (C–E) VEGFA expression was not differentially regulated, and VEGFR2 expression was
  upregulated (C) in HCMECsNCLKD as compared with HCMECsControlKD. NCL knockdown induced
  a significant upregulation of the Dll4-Jagged-Notch signaling pathway, including
  in HES1, NOTCH1, NOTCH4, and Jagged1 (JAG1), while HES2 and DLL4 were not differentially
  regulated upon NCL knockdown (D). siNCL treatment caused a significant downregulation
  of the YAP-TAZ gene YAP1 as well as the YAP-TAZ downstream effector gene CTGF but
  not of the YAP-TAZ downstream effector gene CYR61 (E). (F–O) HCMECs were stained
  for NCL (gray), F-actin (green, stained with phalloidin), VEGFR2 (red, in F–I),
  or p-VEGFR2 (red, in K–N) and the general nuclear marker DAPI (blue). VEGFR2 expression
  was not regulated (J, n = 3), but pVEGFR2 expression was significantly downregulated
  (O, n = 3) upon siRNA-mediated NCL knockdown in HCMECs as compared with the control
  condition. Data represent mean ± SEM. Wald test corrected for multiple testing using
  the Benjamini-Hochberg method (C–E) and 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (J and
  O) were performed. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. The boxed areas (white box) in F, G,
  K, and L are zoomed-in images shown in H, I, M, and N, respectively. Scale bars:
  70 μm in F, G, K, and L; 20 μm in H, I, M, and N.'
