caption: 'Effect of arbutin on the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in HaCAT and
  DFL cells after induced by heat stress. (a and b) Western blotting used to detect
  p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT protein expressions in HaCAT (a) and DFL (b) cells
  with solvent and different concentrations of arbutin (10, 50, and 100 μmol/L) after
  4°C-50 minutes heat stress. (c) Statistically compared expression of p-PI3K/PI3K
  protein expression ratio in (a and b) (n = 3). (d) Statistically compared expression
  of p-AKT/AKT protein expression ratio in (a and b) (n = 3). P value was calculated
  by one-way ANOVA. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; ###P < 0.001 vs. the solvent
  group.'
