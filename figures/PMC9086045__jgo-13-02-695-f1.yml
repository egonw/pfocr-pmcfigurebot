caption: miRNA-320 reduces CAC tumorigenesis. (A) The body weight was assessed daily
  and expressed as the percentage of basal body weight. (B) Disease activity index,
  consisting of weight loss, stool consistency, and stool blood, was measured daily.
  (C) Gross morphology of the colon on day 91. (D) Colon length. (E) Morphology score.
  (F) Colons of the model group and miRNA-320 group were opened longitudinally, and
  the number of tumors was measured. (G) Number of tumors in the whole colon. (H)
  Tumor size distribution according to the tumor numbers. Data are expressed as the
  mean Â± SD. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. miRNA, microRNA; CAC, colitis-associated
  colorectal cancer; SD, standard deviation.
