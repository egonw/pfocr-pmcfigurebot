caption: Activation of TNFα signaling by A2E and BL in ARPE-19 cells. (A) RNA-seq
  of in AREP-19 cells treated with A2E and BL (A2E+BL). The number of DEGs (129 upregulated
  and 43 downregulated) were shown in the pie chart (|FC| ≥ 2.0, Q < 0.05). (B) Heat
  map of genes responsible for cytokines and chemokines, transcription factors, and
  regulation of TNFα signaling. (C) Bar charts of potential signaling pathways generated
  using DEGs by A2E+BL in ARPE-19 cells. Pathway analyses were performed using KEGG
  and MSigDB.
