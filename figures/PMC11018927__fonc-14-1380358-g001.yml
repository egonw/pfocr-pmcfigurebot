caption: CCRA is essentially a hypoproliferative anemia mainly caused by toxic effects
  of anticancer drugs on rapidly proliferating RBC precursors in the bone marrow (major
  red lightning). However, the pathophysiology is often more complex, including drug-induced
  kidney damage with reduced production of endogenous EPO (minor red lightning), and
  low iron availability for erythropoiesis (dotted blue arrow). The latter can be
  due to either absolute or functional iron deficiency (FID, see main text). FID,
  in turn, is mainly determined by inflammatory-related increased hepcidin levels,
  leading to iron se-questration into macrophages. The general mechanisms of action
  of the innovative anti-anemic drug classes discussed in text are depicted. All the
  three classes inhibit path-way/molecule that modulate erythropoiesis, ultimately
  increasing RBCs production. Hypoxia Inducible Factor – Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors
  (HIF-PHIs) stabilize HIF leading to increased production of endogenous EPO. They
  represent an important alternative to the traditional administration of exogenous
  (recombinant) EPO. Moreover, they also have some favorable effects on iron metabolism
  (see main text). Activin Receptor (ACVR) ligand traps bind several members of the
  Transforming Growth Factor – beta (TGF-β) superfamily, thus reducing a key signaling
  pathway which negatively modulates late-stage erythropoiesis. Hepcidin antagonists
  increase iron availability for erythropoiesis.
