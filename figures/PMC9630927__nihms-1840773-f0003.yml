figure_title: RIPK1 mediates hyperactivation of type I IFN signaling in the absence
  of caspase-8
caption: (A and B) Immunoblots of pSTAT1 and tSTAT1 in untreated BMDMs from indicated
  genotypes.(C) qRT-PCR analysis of Ifnb1, Zbp1, and Cxcl10 gene expression from untreated
  BMDMs of indicated genotypes.(D and E) Gene expression profiling of microarray results
  from untreated WT, Casp8−/−Ripk3−/−, Ripk3−/−, and Casp8−/−Ripk3−/−Ripk1−/− BMDMs.
  The heatmap of differentially expressed ISGs in the REACTOME interferon alpha beta
  signaling pathway (D, left), the heatmap of differentially expressed cytokine and
  cytokine receptor interaction genes in the KEGG pathway (D, right), and the enrichment
  plot of the REACTOME interferon alpha beta signaling pathway comparing Casp8−/−Ripk3−/−
  and Casp8−/−Ripk3−/−Ripk1−/− BMDMs (E) are shown.(F) Immunoblots of phosphorylated
  RIPK1 (pRIPK1 [S166]) and total RIPK1 (tRIPK1) in BMDMs of indicated genotypes.
  Full-length and cleaved tRIPK1 bands are shown.(G) Immunoblots of pSTAT1 and tSTAT1
  in BMDMs from indicated genotypes left untreated, treated with Nec-1s (50 μM), or
  treated with Nec-1s (50 μM) and IFNβ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h.(H) IFNβ concentration
  in the culture supernatant from BMDMs of indicated genotypes left untreated or treated
  with Nec-1s (50 μM, overnight).Mean + SEM shown (C, H). β-Actin was used as a loading
  control. Data are representative of at least two (F) or three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA). Molecular weight markers
  are indicated on the right side of blots.
