figure_title: Zinc delays the progression of lung disease by affecting a variety of
  signaling pathways
caption: Zinc targets receptor-interacting protein 1 degradation by increasing the
  activity of zinc finger protein A20, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory cascade
  of downstream NF-κB activation. Zinc supplementation inhibits activation of the
  PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer cells, thereby promoting inhibition of tumor cells by
  the BAD and BAX, which are members of the pro-apoptotic family, enhancing p53-mediated
  apoptosis, and blocking activation of the NF-κB pathway for regulatory T lymphocyte
  recruitment. In patients with obesity, zinc blocks inflammatory lung damage by inhibiting
  the production of leptin, an adipocytokine, thereby blocking activation of the MAPK/NF-κB
  pathways. Zinc removes peroxide and inflammatory factors by activating the ERK/mTOR
  autophagy pathway.
