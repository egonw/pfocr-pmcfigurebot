caption: 'W112 treatment inhibited the activation of MAPK signaling pathway in Aβ25–35-induced
  cell and rat models. (A–D) The phosphorylation and total levels of p38, ERK1/2,
  and JNK in PC12 cells were measured by Western blot. n = 3. (E–H) The phosphorylation
  and total levels of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK in the hippocampus were measured by Western
  blot. n = 8. ## p < 0.01 vs. the control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. the
  model group.'
