caption: Simplified model of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis
  of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in pinto bean. Dashed line indicates multiple steps,
  end products are highlighted in green, and late PA biosynthetic gene encoded enzymes
  are highlighted in blue. 4Cl, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; F3’5’H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  F3’H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; MATE, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion
  protein; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase.
