caption: 'Effect of CDCQ on phosphorylation of PKA, CaMKII, CaMKKβ, and AMPK. Cells
  were treated with 20 µM CDCQ for 5–60 min (a) or 5–20 µM CDCQ for 15 min (b) and
  assessed by Western blotting. c Cells were pretreated with 10 µM H89 (PKA inhibitor)
  and 10 µM KN62 (CaMKII inhibitor) for 1 h and 20 µM CDCQ for 60 min. d Cells were
  pretreated with 10 µM Compound C (CC, an AMPK inhibitor) and 10 µM STO-609 (STO,
  a CaMKKβ inhibitor) for 1 h and 20 µM CDCQ for 60 min. Western blotting was performed
  to assess phosphorylation of PKA, CaMKKβ, CaMKII, AMPK, and eNOS. *Significantly
  different from the control at p < 0.01. #Significantly different from CDCQ-treated
  cells at p < 0.01'
