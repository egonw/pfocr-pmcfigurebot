caption: TA3 inhibited SREBP-1 and FASN expressions, which were involved in the lipogenesis
  pathway, and lowered fatty acid levels in pancreatic tumor tissues. (a) Comparison
  of concentrations of palmitic acid and stearic acid in the vehicle and TA3 groups’
  tumor tissues using LC/MS. The data are shown in the bar graph as the mean ± SD
  (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, vs. vehicle; n = 6/group). (b) Paraffin-embedded tumor
  sections were incubated with SREBP-1 and FASN antibodies and stained brown using
  a DAB solution. (c) BxPC-3 and 3T3-L1 cells were pretreated with TA3 (2.5 and 5
  µM) for 48 h. Intracellular lipids accumulation was stained red using filtered Oil
  Red O solution. After staining, both cells were photographed and quantified using
  an automated microplate ELISA reader. Scale bar, 100 µm. (d) The value presented
  as a percentage relative to that of the control as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, vs. control).
