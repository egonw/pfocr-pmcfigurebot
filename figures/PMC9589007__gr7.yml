caption: Biological pathway of complement cascadePathway visualization based on Reactome
  and complemented with details from KEGG and the literature. Tiles illustrate log-fold
  change values of PD compared with CTRL in liver (left-hand side of tile) and pancreatic
  islets (right-hand side of tile). Proteins leading the increase of the pathway are
  marked as driving and are shown in black font and colored tiles. Proteins participating
  in the pathway and identified from MS proteomics, but not marked as leading edges,
  are in white tiles, while those in gray were not identified in this analysis.
