caption: The role of miRNAs in regulation of Kawasaki disease. Recent studies have
  revealed that miRNAs could play important part in regulation of Kawasaki disease.
  On one hand, miRNAs involve in the regulation of adaptive immunity, which predominantly
  affected the progression and prognosis of KD. On the other hand, miRNAs remarkably
  affected the inflammation response of KD. Besides, miRNAs affected the vascular
  endothelial dysfunction process via influencing related signaling pathway. All these
