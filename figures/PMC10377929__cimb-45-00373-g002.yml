caption: Escin activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 Wnt (TCF/LEF) reporter
  cells. Cells were treated with escin or recombinant Wnt3a for 24 h, lysed with 1×
  passive lysis buffer. GFP (488 nm/507 nm) was measured before luminescence measurement.
  Luciferase activity was measured by adding luciferase substrate. Luciferase activity,
  which refers to TCF/LEF transcriptional activity, was normalized to GFP signal,
  which is constitutively expressed in live cells. ** p < 0.01 compared to non-treated
  control (n = 5). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.
