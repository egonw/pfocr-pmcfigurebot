figure_title: The conditioned medium (CM) of CAFs promotes proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of OCCs
caption: A The typical morphological images of primary CAFs and normal ovarian fibroblasts
  (NOFs). Bar = 100 μm. B, C Western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis presented the expression
  of their representative markers (α-SMA, FAP, and vimentin). D CCK8 assay was used
  to analyze the viability of SKOV3 and A2780 cells co-cultured with CAF-CM and NOF-CM.
  E, F Cell invasion was assessed by Transwell assay in SKOV3 and A2780 cells after
  48-h co-cultured with conditioned medium (100×magnification). G, H Cell migration
  ability was measured by wound healing assay in SKOV3 and A2780 cells (100×magnification).
  The quantitative analyses were performed using ImageJ software. Results are presented
  as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ns not
  significant.
