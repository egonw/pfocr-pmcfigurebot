caption: 'Screening and identification of the gene sets and networks associated with
  ZNF667-VASH1-regulated angiogenesis. (A) Venn Diagram of VASH1 and ZNF667-associated
  differentially expressed genes. Top: upregulated genes, bottom: downregulated genes
  in two gene arrays and RNA sequencing. (B) GO analysis of differentially expressed
  proteins among different biological processes. The GO terms associated with biological
  process, molecular function and cellular component of DEGs. (C) KEGG pathway analysis
  of the top seven networks derived from 403 DEGs in . (D) The mRNA expression of
  six candidate genes in HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-ZNF667 was identified
  by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (n=3 per group). (E) The mRNA expression
  of six candidate genes in HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-VASH1 was
  identified by qPCR (n=3 per group). Data are presented as mean Â± standard deviation.
