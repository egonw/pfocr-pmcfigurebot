figure_title: TRPV4 mediates mechanical response to fluid viscosity via transcriptional
  control of the Hippo pathway
caption: 'a, PCA plot of SC cells exposed to 0.77 cP (SC-0.77cP) or 8 cP (SC-8cP)
  and shTRPV4 cells subjected to 8 cP (shTRPV4-8cP) from 3 independent biological
  replicates. b, Volcano plots displaying DEGs with P≤0.05 in SC cells at 0.77 versus
  8 cP, and between SC and shTRPV4 cells at 8 cP. Downregulated genes are in blue
  and upregulated in red. c, Ingenuity pathway analyses of paired samples shown in
  (b). Top 5 commonly upregulated and downregulated pathways are shown. d, Heatmap
  showing the relative expression levels of Hippo pathway genes identified in (c).
  e, (Left) Confocal images of cells on collagen-I-coated glass bottom dishes after
  4 h of exposure to medium of prescribed viscosities and immunostained for YAP1 and
  Hoechst. Scale bars: 20 µm. (Right) Quantification of nuclear-to-cytosolic YAP1
  ratio. Data are mean ± s.d. for n≥46 cells from 2 experiments. f, Confined migration
  speeds of cells, pre-conditioned at 0.77 or 8 cP in the presence of verteporfin
  or vehicle control for 6 days, and resuspended in the indicated “migration” viscosity
  without verteporfin in which their motility was tracked. Data are mean ± s.d. for
  n≥107 cells from 2 experiments. Tests performed: Mann Whitney (e) and Kruskal-Wallis
  followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons (f). Images are representative of 2 independent
  biological replicas (e). Cell model: MDA-MB-231.'
