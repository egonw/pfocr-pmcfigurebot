caption: BDX-01 downregulated the NLRP3 inflammasome and proinflammatory factors in
  the intestinal cells and macrophages through the FXR-dependent pathway. (A–D) mRNA
  levels of Nlrp3, Il-1β, Fxr, and Ibabp in Caco2 cells. Caco2 cells were pretreated
  with BDX-01 (MOI = 1:100), GW4064 (10 μM), and TβMCA (100 μM) for 4 h, followed
  by TNF-α (100 ng/mL) for 4 h. (E,F) Nlrp3, Il-1β, Fxr, and Ibabp expression in macrophages
  pretreated with BDX-01 (MOI = 1:100), GW4064 (10 μM), and TβMCA (100 μM) for 4 h
  and LPS (1 μg/mL) for 4 h. (G–I) Fxr, Nlrp3, and Il-1β expression levels in Caco2
  cells. The Caco2 cells were pretreated with live BDX-01 (MOI = 1:100), heat-killed
  BDX-01 (MOI = 1:100), and BDS (50%) for 4 h, followed by TNF-α (100 ng/mL) for 4 h.
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. n = 3 per group.
