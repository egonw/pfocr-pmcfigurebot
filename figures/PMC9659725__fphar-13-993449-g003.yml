caption: 'Peripheral proteomic changes after fluoxetine exposure in responders and
  non-responders (A) Hierarchical bivariate clustering of expression profiles of animals
  (column) and proteins (rows) depicts the differences between Cort/Veh, Flx-NR, and
  Flx-NR-ECS groups. An animalâ€™s expression is red for above-average values, and blue
  for below-average values (B) Principal Component Analysis of expression profiles
  revealed two main axis separating results. (C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed
  a molecular interaction network based on differentially expressed proteins. This
  protein network was significantly connected to the following canonical pathways:
  glucocorticoid receptor signaling, PI3K/Akt signaling and NRF2-mediated oxidative
  stress response.'
