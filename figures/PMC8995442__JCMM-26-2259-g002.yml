caption: Patients with different clinical features (including T stage (A), N stage
  (B), TNM stage (C) and tumour subtype (D)) had significantly different levels of
  nomogram scores. GSEA showed that the chemokine signalling pathway (E), T cell receptor
  signalling pathway (F), cell adhesion molecules CAMS (G), IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling
  (H), inflammatory response (I) and apoptosis (J) are differentially enriched in
  the low‐risk group
