caption: 'The effects of 3,3′,4,5′-TMS on IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. (a) Representative
  Western blots and summarized data for protein expressions of (b) IRS1, (c) IRS2
  and (d) phosphorylated IRS1 at Ser307 in HepG2 cells with different treatments.
  (e) PI3K expressions and (f) phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in IR-HepG2 cells.
  Values are the means ± SEM (n = 4); * p < 0.05 vs. Control; # p < 0.05 vs. DXMS
