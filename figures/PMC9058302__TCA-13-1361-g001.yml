caption: Analysis of the mechanism of radiosensitization in NSCLC cells. (a, b) Apoptosis
  analysis of NSCLC cells using Annexin V‐FITC/PI double staining and flow cytometry.
  (a) H460 and (b) A549 cells pretreated with 20 nM diABZI or DMSO were irradiated
  with γ‐ray (0, 2, and 4 Gy) and the apoptosis was assessed at 48 h after IR. Representative
  images (left panel) and percentages of apoptotic cells (early apoptotic cells plus
  late apoptotic cells) (right panel) are shown. (c–j) Expression levels of relevant
  signaling molecules in H460 cells. The mRNA levels of (c) cGAS and (d) STING were
  analyzed by qRT‐PCR. (e) cGAMP level in H460 cell lysate was measured by human cGAMP
  ELISA kit and normalized by total protein concentration. The mRNA levels of (f)
  TBK1, (g) IRF3, (h) p65, (i) BAX and (j) Caspase‐3 in H460 cells were analyzed by
  qRT‐PCR. All tests were repeated at least three times and the data are represented
  as mean ± standard deviation. NS, not significant; *p <0.05; **p <0.01
