caption: 'Effect of hydroxytyrosol on cell apoptosis levels in Jurkat (panel A) and
  HL60 (panel B) cell lines. Apoptosis values were obtained using flow cytometry.
  A positive control in the presence of staurosporine (1 μg·mL−1) was used. Panel
  A corresponds to Jurkat cells and panel B to HL60 cells. Cells were treated with
  hydroxytyrosol IC50 for 24 h for Jurkat and 72 h for HL60 cells. Top: Fluorescence
  diagrams from a representative experiment are depicted and show the effect of hydroxytyrosol
  on different cell states, viability, early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis
  (Jurkat panel A and HL60 panel B). Below: the percentage of cells in each of these
  states are represented. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). Different capital
  letters indicate the existence of significant differences (p < 0.01). Quadrants:
  Q1, necrosis; Q2, late apoptosis; Q3, living cells; Q4, early apoptosis.'
