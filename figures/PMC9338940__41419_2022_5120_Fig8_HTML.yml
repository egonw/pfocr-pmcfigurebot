figure_title: Sestrin2 modulates oxidative stress and activation of TSP-1/TGF-β1/Smad3
  signaling pathway induced by diabetes
caption: A–F A representative Western blot and relevant quantification of Nox4, TSP-1,
  TGF-β1, and phosphorylation level of Smad3 in glomeruli from mice of WT, WT + DM,
  TgN, and TgN+DM groups (n = 3). G Representative immunofluorescence images of Nox4
  (green) and synaptopodin (red) in glomeruli from four groups of mice, and DAPI is
  a dye for nucleus. WT wild-type mice, WT + DM diabetic WT mice, TgN B6-TgN (CMV-Sestrin2)
  mice, TgN+DM diabetic TgN mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001.
