caption: Age-specific gene and pathway expression. (A) Genes significantly upregulated
  (red dots) and downregulated (blue dots) in the young group compared to the old
  group. The horizontal line represents the threshold with a corrected P value of
  .05, and the vertical lines represent a log2 (fold change) >1 or <−1, with labels
  indicating genes with the greatest differences having a log2 (fold change) >4 or <−4.
  The functional interaction network of ZFP42 (B) and PNMA5 (C). (D) GSEA plot displaying
  pathways significantly upregulated in the young group. (E) Differences in the activity
  of various metabolic pathways between the young and old groups, assessed for significance
  using the Wilcoxon test, where *P < .5, **P < .01, ***P < .001. GSEA = gene set
  enrichment analysis, ns = no significant difference.
