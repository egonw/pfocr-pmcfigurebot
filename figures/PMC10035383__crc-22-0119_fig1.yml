caption: 'Identification of biomarkers of PARPi sensitivity through CRISPR-Cas9 LoF
  screens. A, Summary of cell lines and CRISPR screens performed or analyzed in this
  study. Further details can be found in the Materials and Methods section. B, STRING
  pathway analysis of the 110 genes identified in at least two CRISPR screens whose
  loss sensitizes cells to PARPi treatment. BER: base excision repair; HRR: homologous
  recombination repair; FA: Fanconi anaemia pathway; RER: ribonucleotide excision
  repair; DDR: DNA damage response. C, Ranking of the top 22 genes identified in our
  analyses. Genes are color coded for the different DNA repair pathways they are primarily
  linked to. Acronyms are as in B. D, Top seven biological processes enriched in the
  pathway analysis. Dose–response curve for SKOV3 BRCA2 KO (clone 13; E) and DU145
  BRCA1 KO (clone A1; F) isogenic pairs treated with olaparib for 10–14 days in clonogenic
  survival assays. Results are shown as mean of n = 4 biological replicates ± SD for
  the dose–response curves.'
