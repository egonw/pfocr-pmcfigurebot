caption: Treatment with OA accelerated cell cycle progression via the p53 signaling
  pathway in colonic epithelial cells. A. Heatmap of DEGs in the colonic tissues of
  rats treated with DMSO or OA. B. GO classification of the top 30 enriched terms
  of the altered mRNAs in the colonic tissues following treatment with OA. The results
  have been displayed as -log10 P values (P < 0.05). C. OA promoted the proliferation
  of HCT116 cells. ∗∗P < 0.01. D. OA promoted cell cycle transition in HCT116 cells.
  ∗P < 0.05. E. Association between OA exposure and the p53 signaling pathway.
