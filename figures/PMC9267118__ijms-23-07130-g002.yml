caption: Cucurbitacin B inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 transcription. (A,B) A549 cells
  were pretreated with or without cucurbitacin B for 1 h and were then treated with
  (+) or (−) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) for 3 h. ICAM-1 mRNA (fold) is shown as the mean ±
  S.E. of three independent experiments (A). Cell viability (%) is shown as the mean
  ± S.E. of four independent experiments (B). (C) A549 cells were transfected with
  plasmid vectors encoding the ICAM-1 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter
  and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter for 17 h.
  Transfected A549 cells were pretreated with or without cucurbitacin B for 1 h and
  were then treated with (+) or without (−) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) for 3 h. ICAM-1 promoter-driven
  luciferase activity was normalized to CMV promoter-driven luciferase activity. Luciferase
  activity (fold) is shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. ***
  p < 0.001.
