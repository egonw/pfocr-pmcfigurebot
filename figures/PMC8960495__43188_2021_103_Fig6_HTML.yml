caption: Dysregulation of Wnt pathway and epigenetic chromatin modification genes
  in male mice exposed in utero to e-cig aerosols. Male mice exposed in utero to e-cig
  aerosol exhibited dysregulation of a number of genes associated with the Wnt signaling
  pathway and epigenetic chromatin modification at both PND5 and 11. N = 3–4 per group.
  Data are expressed as mean fold-change compared to respective in utero air control
  group. Data >  ± 1.5-fold-change were considered significant
article_title: In utero exposure to electronic-cigarette aerosols decreases lung fibrillar
  collagen content, increases Newtonian resistance and induces sex-specific molecular
  signatures in neonatal mice.
