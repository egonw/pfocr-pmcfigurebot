caption: RNA sequencing analysis reveals the heterogeneity of NC, TP and TT. (A) PC
  analysis and (B) hierarchical clustering analysis revealed an obvious distinction
  between tumour and non-tumour tissues. (C) Volcano plot showing the DEGs between
  TT and TP. (D) Top 20 DEGs in TT vs. TP; (E) KEGG pathway and GO BP analysis of
  DEGs in TT vs. TP showing P-values (black dots) and gene counts (bars). (F) Gene
  co-expression network analysis showing the key transcription factors and DEGs between
  TT and TP (purple rectangles represent the key transcription factors; pink ovals
  represent DEGs; pink lines represent positive correlations; and blue lines represent
  negative correlations); BP, biological process; DEGs, differentially expressed genes;
  GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; NC, normal tissue;
  PC, principal component; TP, paracarcinoma tissue; TT, primary tumour tissue.
