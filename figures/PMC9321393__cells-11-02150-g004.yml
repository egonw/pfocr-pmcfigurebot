caption: Validation of the Tor signaling pathway. (a) WB analysis of XLRS retinas
  at P56. (b) Statistical histogram of relative gray value of proteins in (a). (c)
  Immunofluorescence images of MEF cells. DAPI fluorescence (blue) marking the cell
  nuclei. Vimentin (green), an antibody specific for MEF cells, were used to validate
  the purity of MEF cell lines. Bar represents 100 Âµm. (d) WB analysis of MEF cells
  derived by WT (left) or RS1 KO (right) mouse. (e) Statistical histogram of relative
  gray value of proteins in (d). WB results were quantified using ImageJ software
  (Version 1.52a, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and are presented as ratios of the grey
  value (phosphorylation of target protein vs. target protein). Differences between
  groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. ***, p < 0.001.
