caption: Molecular mechanisms of the cardiotonic effect of Fuzi. Total alkaloids,
  polysaccharide and water-soluble alkaloids of Fuzi are the main components of cardiac
  activity. Total alkaloids inhibit myocardial fibrosis mainly by regulating the RAAS
  system. Polysaccharide promote autophagy and inhibit vascular calcification and
  apoptosis by regulating AMPK, JAK/STAT pathways and exerting antioxidant effects.
  Water-soluble alkaloids regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis,
  and regulate mitochondria-mediated pathways to promote mitochondrial energy metabolism.
