caption: Effect of taurine on the transcriptional activity of the TXNIP promoter containing
  −1299/+142 and +122/+256. Caco-2 cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing
  partial promoter region of TXNIP (−1299/+142, +122/+256) and then replaced with
  a medium containing 100 mM of taurine. After 24 h, the cells were subjected to luciferase
  assay. The results are expressed as relative values, with a control value of +122/+256
  as 1. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. (n = 3), * p < 0.05, vs. the control
  value (Student’s t-test).
