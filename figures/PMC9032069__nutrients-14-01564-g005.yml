caption: 'SIX1 is critical for Rh4-induced TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway and EMT
  process inhibition in GC. (A) Western blot showing the effects of EMT biomarkers
  and TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling protein expression in GC cells (HGC-27 and BGC-823)
  after incubation with disitertide and Rh4. (B) Western blot showing effects of EMT
  biomarkers and TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling protein expression in GC cells (HGC-27 and
  BGC-823) after incubation with SIX1-siRNA and Rh4. β-Actin was used as an endogenous
  reference. Quantification plots are shown on the right. Statistics are exhibited
  as the mean ± SD of triplicate independent experiments; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and
  ### p < 0.001 compared with the disitertide-treated group.'
