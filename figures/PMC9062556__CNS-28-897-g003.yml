caption: 'Hsa_circ_0072309 promotes autophagy by p53 signaling pathway. (A) The hsa_circ_0072309
  overexpressed cells and the control cells were treated with pifithrin‐α(PFT‐α) or
  not. Autophagic flux was determined by diploid adenovirus (mRFP‐GFP‐LC3). Representative
  images of fluorescent LC3 puncta are shown. Red dots represent autolysosomes and
  yellow dots autophagosomes, scale bars =10 μm. (B) The statistics of LC3 puncta
  in Figure . (C) Western blot was used to detect the protein level of ATG16L1, ATG7,
  and p62 when the hsa_circ_0072309 overexpressed cells and the control cells were
  treated with pifithrin‐αor not. The graphs are representative of three independent
  experiments with similar results. U87‐PCDH: the control group. U87‐72309: the hsa_circ_0072309
  overexpressed group. (D) The quantification of Figure'
