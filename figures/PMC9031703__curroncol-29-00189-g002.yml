caption: Role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cancer. In the activated canonical
  pathway. Wnt allows the connection between Frizzled receptor and lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP), which further activates the Dishevelled followed by inhibition of
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β), axis inhibitor (AXIN), adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKIα) complex. This complex inhibits
  the phosphorylation of β-catenin, subsequently enters into the nucleus, and transcribes
  the cancer-related genes with the help of the TCF/LEF complex. The mechanism is
  vice-versa in the inhibited canonical Wnt pathway. The non-canonical Wnt pathway
  utilizes Wnt5a for the activation of the pathway and allows the gene transcription
  through calcium ions. This illustration was created using resources available at
