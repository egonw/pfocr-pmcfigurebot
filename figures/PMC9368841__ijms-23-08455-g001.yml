caption: 'Characterization of T-DNA insertion lines with analysis of gene expression
  and protein abundance. (A) Schematic diagram depicting the positions of T-DNA insertions
  in OsRACK1B. Gray, orange, and white bars represent the exons, 5’-UTR, and 3´-UTR
  region, respectively. ATG and TGA are start and stop codons. The 1011 bp indicates
  the CDS length. The gray line represents the intron. The triangles indicate OsRack1b
  mutant alleles (OX-1, PFG_3A-07870.R; OX-2, PFG_3A-60871.L). Plants with T-DNA insertion
  in 3A-60871.L and 3A-07870.R lines (B) resulted in RACK1B overexpression, revealed
  by expression analysis shown in qRT-PCR (C) and Western blot (D). Samples were collected
  from four-week-old wild-type (WT) and OsRack1b mutant rice plants. For Western blot,
  an equal amount of leaf proteins extracted from the indicated genotypes was subjected
  to immunoblot analysis stained with anti-OsRACK1B antibody. Ponceau-stained membrane
  is shown as the loading control. Molecular weight markers are indicated in kDa.
  For qRT-PCR analysis, the normalized expression level of OsRACK1B in transgenic
  rice lines was compared to the wild-type plant. Total RNA was extracted from leaf
  tissues sampled from detached leaves of four-week-old wild-type and transgenic plants,
  as described in Methods. OsActin-1(LOC4333919) was used to standardize transcript
  levels in each sample. The data are shown as the means  ±  SE of three technical
  repeats. Double, and triple asterisks indicate statistical significance: ** p <
  0.01 and *** p < 0.001, respectively, compared to wild-type (Student’s t-test).
