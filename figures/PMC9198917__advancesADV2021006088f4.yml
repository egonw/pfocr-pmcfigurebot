caption: Acute LPS exposure depends on IFN signaling to activate HSCs. (A) Scheme
  illustrating in vitro culturing of HSPC (LK CD150+) and CD11b+ CD115+ BM cells in
  presence of LPS (100 ng/mL, 18 hours) and subsequent transfer of conditioned medium
  to cultured wt or TLR4−/− HSPCs (18 hours). (B) Relative Sca-1 expression in LK
  CD150+ cells (HSPCs) after in vitro culturing with conditioned medium as indicated
  in  (n = 3). P values were obtained by unpaired t test. (C) Scheme indicating in vivo
  BrdU uptake (18 mg/kg, 14 hours) and treatment of wt and Sca-1−/− mice with PBS
  (control) or LPS (0.25 mg/kg) for 18 hours. (D) Fourteen-hour BrdU (18 mg/kg) uptake
  of HSCs (LK CD150+CD48-CD34-) from wt or Sca-1−/− mice treated with PBS or LPS (0.25
  mg/kg) for 18 hours (n = 6). P values were obtained by unpaired t test. (E) IFNα
  and IFNγ levels determined by ELISA in BM supernatant after in vivo treatment of
  wt mice with PBS or LPS (0.25 mg/kg, 4 hours) (n = 6). P values were determined
  by unpaired t test. (F) Principal component analysis and comparison of Illumina
  Chip array data obtained from HSCs isolated from PBS (control), LPS (0.25 mg/kg),
  or IFNα (5 × 106U/kg) treated wt mice (18 hours). (G) Hallmark pathway enrichment
  analysis using EnrichR of 88 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between
  IFNα– and LPS-treated HSCs. P values were obtained from the online EnrichR program
  and were not modified. (H) Gene ontology biological processes enrichment analysis
  using EnrichR of 88 DEGs shared between IFNα– and LPS-treated HSCs. P values were
  obtained from the online EnrichR program and were not modified. (I) Scheme indicating
  in vivo treatment of wt and IFNAR−/−IFNGR−/− mice with PBS (control) or LPS (0.25
  mg/kg) for 18 hours. (J) Cell cycle analysis (icKi67-Hoechst 33342) of HSCs (LSK
  CD150+CD48-CD34-) from wt or IFNAR−/−IFNGR−/− mice treated with PBS (control) or
  LPS (indicated concentrations, 18 hours). Experimental set-up as indicated in  (n
  = 3). P values refer to G0 phase and were determined by ANOVA Tukey’s post hoc test.
