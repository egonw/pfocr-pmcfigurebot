caption: 'TRIM44 knockdown regulates EC cell proliferation, invasion and migration
  (a) Expression of TRIM44 in TRIM44-knockdown EC cells assessed by Q–PCR in RL95-2
  and Ishikawa cells. (b) Expression of TRIM44 in TRIM44-knockdown EC cells was detected
  by Western blot analysis. (c) The proliferation of EC cells at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  and 6 days following TRIM44 knockdown (n = 6). (d) TRIM44 knockdown inhibits the
  G1/S transition of EC cells. ((e), (f)) Cell apoptosis was detected in TRIM44-knockdown
  EC cells using flow cytometry analysis (n = 6). ((g), (h)) Transwell invasion assays
  were performed in TRIM44-knockdown EC cells (n = 6). all data are presented as the
  mean ± SD. statistical significance: ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.'
