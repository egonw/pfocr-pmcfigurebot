caption: 'RT-PCR for the mRNA levels for miRNA-29a-3p, PTEN, Akt, and mTOR. (a) The
  expression of miRNA-29a-3p increased in the mimic miRNA-29a-3p group and decreased
  in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p group (∗∗∗: p < 0.001). (b) The expression of PTEN
  was the lowest in the mimic miRNA-29a-3p group and in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p
  group; the expressions of PTEN gene were the highest (∗∗∗: p < 0.001). (c and d)
  There was no distinct difference in the mRNA expression of Akt and mTOR between
  the groups (p > 0.05).'
