caption: Multiple enrichment analysis results. (a) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.
  The red bar represents the number of pathways in the BP part, the green bar represents
  the number of pathways in the CC part, and the blue bar represents the number of
  pathways in the MF part; (b) Disease Ontology (DO) enrichment. The yellow bars represent
  the number of pathways in the DO part; (c) GSEA-enriched pathways. Yellow lines
  represent B cell receptor signaling pathway, red lines represent MAPK signaling
  pathway, and blue lines represent Th1-Th2 cell differentiation.
