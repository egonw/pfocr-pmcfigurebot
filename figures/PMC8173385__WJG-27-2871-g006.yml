caption: 'Gene set enrichment analysis identified gene sets that were different between
  the high-risk-score group and low-risk-score group in stomach adenocarcinoma. A:
  The ECM receptor interaction pathway was significantly different between the high-risk-score
  group and low-risk-score group; B: The cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction
  pathway was significantly different between the high-risk-score group and low-risk-score
  group; C: The MAPK signaling pathway was significantly different between the high-risk-score
  group and low-risk-score group; D: The spliceosome pathway was significantly different
  between the high-risk-score group and low-risk-score group; E: The cell cycle pathway
  was significantly different between the high-risk-score group and low-risk-score
  group; F: The proteasome pathway was significantly different between the high-risk-score
  group and low-risk-score group.'
