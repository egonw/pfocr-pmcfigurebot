caption: 'T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2 (TIAM2) is highly expressed in
  osteosarcoma (OS) tissue and is correlated with the prognosis of OS. A: TIAM2 expression
  levels of diverse human tumor types. B, C: Immunohistochemical (IHC) results showing
  that the expression of TIAM2 was significantly upregulated in OS tissue (200×);
  Assessment of staining intensity by positive cells ratio. D: The protein levels
  of TIAM2 in hFOB1.19, U2OS, and 143B cells detected using western blotting. Quantification
  of the band density ratio of TIAM2 to GAPDH. E: The mRNA expression of TIAM2 determined
  using qRT-PCR in hFOB1.19, U2OS, and 143B cells. G–I: Survival curve analysis of
  TIAM2 high- and low-expression groups in three databases. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.'
article_title: TIAM2 promotes proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells by
  activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
