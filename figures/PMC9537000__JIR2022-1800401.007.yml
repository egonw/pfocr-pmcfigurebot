caption: Effect of the conciliatory anti-allergic decoction on the levels of pyroptosis
  and TLR3/NLRP3/NF-κB/IRF3 pathway-related proteins in the lungs of mice with OVA/RSV-induced
  asthma. (a) The lung tissue viral load was measured using a qPCR assay. (b) The
  mRNA levels of TLR3, NF-κB, and IRF3 in lung tissues. (c) Western blot detected
  the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Cleaved caspase-3 in lung tissues. (d, e) The
  pyroptosis-related protein expressions were analyzed by western blotting. (f) The
  TLR3/NLRP3/NF-κB/IRF3 pathway-related protein levels were also determined by western
  blotting. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the MC group.
