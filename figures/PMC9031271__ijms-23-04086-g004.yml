caption: (A)—Gene expression of LTBPs and TGF-β isoforms in ASMC; (B)—Gene expression
  of canonical TGF-β signaling pathway receptors in ASMC; (C)—Gene expression of canonical
  TGF-β signaling pathway molecules in ASMC; (D)—Gene expression of non-canonical
  TGF-β signaling pathway molecules in ASMC. AA—allergic asthma; HS—healthy subjects;
  SNEA—severe non-allergic eosinophilic asthma. AA, n = 4, SNEA, n = 4, HS, n = 4.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM, fold change over control ASMC. * p <0.05 compared
  with control ASMC; ** p < 0.01 compared with control ASMC; *** p < 0.001 compared
  with control ASMC; § p < 0.05 compared with HS eosinophil effect. Statistical analysis
  between investigated groups—two-sided Mann–Whitney U test (independent data); two-sided
  Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test (dependent data); and Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test, which was used for gene expression analysis against control ASMC that were
  not incubated with eosinophils.
