caption: TRAF6 124mut inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of SW480 and
  HCT116 cells. (A) Colony‐forming assays were performed to determine the proliferative
  ability of SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 or pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6
  124mut plasmids. One representative image from three reproducible experiments is
  shown. The number of colonies is shown in the bar graph. (B, C, D, E) Scratch‐wound
  assay (B, C), migration assay (D), and invasion assay (E) were used to detect the
  metastatic potential of HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6
  or pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 124mut plasmids, respectively. The number of migrated and invaded
  cells were counted from five different fields under a microscope. Magnification,
  ×100. (F) Each of 5×106 HCT116‐pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 or HCT116‐pCDH‐3×Flag‐TRAF6 124mut
  cells were injected into nude mice. After 6 weeks, the mice were killed, the tumors
  were weighed, and the volume was calculated (n = 5). G Schematic diagram of the
  mechanism of TRAF6 regulating the LPS‐NF‐κB‐VEGF‐C signaling pathway through ubiquitination
  in colorectal cancer. Data are shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001
