caption: LncRNAs play multiple roles in DNA damage response (DDR) to address genotoxic
  stress. Under exogenous genotoxic agent-mediated DNA damage, lncRNAs are involved
  in a variety of regulatory roles of DDR and modulate cell fates. The key upstream
  transcription factors of each distinct lncRNA and the downstream targeted mechanisms
  or the related cellular processes are summarized. LncRNAs that particularly impact
  therapeutic susceptibility are marked. AP1 (activator protein 1), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated), BORG (BMP/OP-responsive gene), DlincRNA (damage-induced long non-coding
  RNA), E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1), EGR1 (early growth response protein 1),
  ERIC (E2F1-regulated inhibitor of cell death), HITT (HIF-1α inhibitor at translation
  level), hnRNP-K (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K), HOTAIR (HOX transcript
  antisense RNA), HR (homologous recombination), IL-6 (interleukin 6), LINP1 (LncRNA
  In non-homologous end joining pathway 1), MALAT1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma
  transcript 1), NBAT1 (neuroblastoma associated transcript 1), NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB),
  NHEJ (non-homologous end joining), PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), Pol II
  (RNA polymerase II), Pvt1b (plasmacytoma variant 1b), RPA1 (replication protein
  A1), SBF2-AS1 (SBF2 antisense RNA 1), SPARCLE (suicidal PARP-1 cleavage enhancer),
  XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross complementing 4) and ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox
  1). This figure was created with BioRender.com.
