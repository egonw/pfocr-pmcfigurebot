caption: SnPP localization in proximal tubules (panel a), resulting in Nrf2 nuclear
  translocation (panel b) and Nrf2 activation (panel c). Panel a within 4 h of SnPP
  injection, SnPP's fluorescent signal was observed in mouse renal cortex, and specifically
  localized to proximal tubules (the asterix denotes a glomerulus, which demonstrated
  no uptake). The lower panel shows an absence of fluorescence in control mouse kidney
  tissue. Panel b an increase in Nrf2 protein is observed by Western blots in nuclear
  protein extracts following SnPP injection. C, control nuclear extracts. Panel c
  RNAseq volcano plot showing differential gene expression between kidneys exposed
  to SnPP × 4 h, versus saline‐injected controls. And 111 genes were found to be upregulated
  (red dots) and 26 genes were found to be downregulated (green dots), compared to
  the control group. The four genes with the highest SnPP‐induced expression were
  HO‐1, cytochrome p450‐2a5 (Cyp2a5), aldo‐keto reductase family 1 member C18 (Akr1c18),
  and cytokine inducible SH2‐containing protein (Cish). The most suppressed gene was
  ALAS (aminolevulinate synthase), the first enzyme controlling the heme regulatory
  pathway. x axis = log fold change (log10FC); y axis = false discovery rate (‐log10FDR)
