caption: 'NGR1 administration improves neurological function after SCI. BBB scores
  of the Sham + vehicle, Sham + NGR1, SCI + vehicle, and SCI+NGR1 groups were examined
  at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI. N = 6. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
  Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
  comparisons posttest was used. *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle group; #P < 0.01,
  ###P < 0.001 vs. the SCI + vehicle group. BBB, Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan; NGR1, notoginsenoside
  R1; SCI, spinal cord injury.'
article_title: Notoginsenoside R1 alleviates spinal cord injury by inhibiting oxidative
  stress, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammation via activating the nuclear factor erythroid
  2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway.
