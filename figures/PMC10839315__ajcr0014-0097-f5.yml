caption: CTSC knockdown suppressed EMT through the YAP signaling pathway. A. YAP overexpression
  levels are determined by western blot analysis in CTSC knockdown cell lines. B.
  CTSC knockdown cells were transfected with YAP. YAP overexpression significantly
  changes the expression of EMT markers and MMPs. C, D. Transwell migration and invasion
  assay showing that YAP overexpression promotes CTSC inhibition of cell migration
  and invasion. The number of cells in five randomly chosen fields is counted. Data
  are presented as the means ± standard deviation and are analyzed using Student’s
  t-test (n = 3). Scale bar, 200 μm. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
