caption: Analysis of carbon metabolism in maize seedling leaves under phospholipase
  C inhibition. (A), changes in reducing sugar content; (B), changes in starch content;
  (C), changes in total soluble sugar content; (D), changes in cellulose content;
  (E), Calvin cycle pa−1thway DEGs; (F), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway DEGs;
  (G), tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway DEGs. Values are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3
  individuals per group). * means that the difference from the control reaches a significant
  level, p < 0.05.
