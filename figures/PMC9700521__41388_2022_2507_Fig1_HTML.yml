figure_title: Identification of OTUB1 as a key regulator of Hippo signaling pathway
  in gastric cancer
caption: A Flowchart of screening critical DUBs of modulating Hippo signaling in HEK293.
  B The relative expression level of CTGF in HEK293 cells transfected with DUBs in
  the screening library. The RT-qPCR results is normalized to 1. Blue dot represents
  OTUB1 and red dot represents previous reported DUBs regulating Hippo pathway. C
  The relative RNA level of OTUB1 in gastric tumor samples versus normal samples in
  TCGA combined with GTEX are shown. D Immunohistochemistry (IHC) detecting OTUB1
  expression in gastric cancer specimen as well as matched normal tissues. E Quantitative
  IOD values for IHC staining between normal and tumor tissues are presented in the
  histogram. Two-tailed paired Student’s t-test is conducted to detect significant
  differences between normal and tumor tissues ***P < 0.001). F Quantitative HTseq
  counts of OTUB1 between normal tissues and different stage of tumor are presented
  in the histogram. One-way ANOVA is conducted to detect significant differences (**P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001). G Kaplan–Meier survival analysis comparing the overall survival of
  gastric cancer patients with high and low OTUB1 expression in KMPLOT database. H
  Kaplan–Meier survival analysis comparing the overall survival of gastric cancer
  patients with high and low YAP expression in KMPLOT database. I Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-Seq data from AGS cell lines treated with scrambled or two
  independent siRNA targeting OTUB1 (P < 0.001). J Volcano map of RNA-seq data from
  AGS cell lines treated with scrambled or two independent siRNA targeting OTUB1. | log2Fold
  change | >1 and adj. P value < 0.05 are set as screening criteria. K Top 20 KEGG
  pathway enriched by differentially down-regulated genes (left panel) or up-regulated
  genes (right panel). L Heatmap of differentially Hippo pathway related genes in
  RNA-seq data from AGS celllines treated with scrambled or two independent siRNA
  targeting OTUB1. M Heatmap of OTUB1 and differentially Hippo pathway related genes
  from tumor tissue and paired normal tissue of gastric cancer patients in GSE29272.
  The blue line represents normal tissue and red represents tumor tissue. N Relationships
  of consensus module eignegenes and the expression level of OTUB1. The module name
  is indicated on the left side of each cell. The correlation coefficient between
  OTUB1 expression and module is shown in each cell, with the p values printed below
  the correlations coefficient in parentheses. Genes in each module is indicated in
  the corresponding cell. Red colors represent positive correlations, while blue colors
  denote negative correlations. IOD integrated optic density, ES enrichment score,
  NES normalized enrichment score.
