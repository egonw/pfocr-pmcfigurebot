caption: 'Comparison of NR2B‐CREB‐BDNF signaling pathway protein expression in hippocampal
  tissue of rats (n = 3). TEMPOL pretreatment reduces the expression of NR2B, p‐CREB,
  and BDNF proteins in M1 microglia in the hippocampal region of aged rats under sevoflurane
  anesthesia: (A) Western blot image, (B) NR2B, (C) p‐CREB, and (D) BDNF. Compared
  with groups C and T, ***p < .001; compared with group S, ###p < .001. A one‐way
  analysis of variance was used to compare NR2B, p‐CREB, and BDNF among groups, and
  the difference was statistically significant (p < .001). BDNF, brain‐derived neurotrophic
  factor; N2RB, N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptor subunit 2B; p‐CREB, p‐cAMP responsive
  element binding protein.'
