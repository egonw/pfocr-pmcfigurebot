caption: 'Kub3 deletion results in pulmonary atelectasis during embryonic development.
  (A) Floating assay for E18.5 lungs. WT, HT and KO lungs were dissected and put in
  PBS buffer. WT and HT lungs floated in PBS buffer, but Kub3 KO lungs sank due to
  a lack of air inflation. (B) Representative images of H&E-stained lung sections
  of WT and KO lungs at E18.5. Scale bar: 50 µm in the upper panel; 20 µm in the bottom
  panel. (C) Morphometric analysis of lung interalveolar distance measured by mean
  linear intercept (MLI) and number of distal alveolar estimated by radial alveolar
  counts (RACs) in WT and KO lungs at E18.5 (n = 7 per group; **** p < 0.0001). (D)
  Alcian blue–Alizarin staining of trachea in the E18.5 lung. The cartilaginous trachea
  is stained dark blue by Alcian blue. (E) Representative images of H&E-stained lung
  sections of WT and KO lungs at E15.5. Scale bar: 50 µm in the upper panel; 20 µm
  in the bottom panel. (F) Morphometric analysis of the number of distal epithelial
  buds in E15.5 lungs (n = 6 per group. p > 0.05, ns: non-significant). (G) Representative
  images of H&E-stained lung sections of WT and KO lungs at E17.5. Scale bar: 50 µm
  in upper panel; 20 µm in bottom panel.'
