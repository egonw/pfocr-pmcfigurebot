caption: 'Potential targets for drug therapy after SAH.Several apoptosis pathways
  are activated after SAH, including extrinsic, mitochondrial, ER, p53 and ROS pathways.
  SAH can be treated with a variety of apoptosis inhibitors including death receptor
  inhibitors, mitochondrial apoptosis pathway inhibitors, ERS inhibitors, ROS inhibitors,
  p53 inhibitors, and Ca2+ antagonists. ER/ERS: Endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic
  reticulum stress; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SAH: subarachnoid hemorrhage.'

  and potential therapeutic targets in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
