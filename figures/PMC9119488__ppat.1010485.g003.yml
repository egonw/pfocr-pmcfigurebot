figure_title: Transcriptional activation in CCHFV infected livers compared to mock
  infected mice
caption: A. Transcriptional activation in liver homogenates from mice (n = 3 per group/time
  point) infected with CCHFV with IFN-I blockade or mock infected were examined by
  NanoString. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed by nSolver analysis
  software. Circles designated as infected WT mice (1), infected MAVS KO mice day
  4 and 10 (2) and uninfected mice (3). The uncircled data point is from an unclustered
  MAVS KO infected mouse from D4. B. Heat map showing individual changes in indicated
  CCHFV infected mice relative to uninfected control mice. C. Log2 fold changes for
  selected genes involved in the indicated pathways were determined along with statistical
  significance. D. Activation score (Z-score) for the indicated pathways in infected
  WT or MAVS KO mice versus uninfected mice. Activation value was determined by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software.
