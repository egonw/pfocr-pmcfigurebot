caption: SNHG3 Activates BMP2 Signaling Pathway to Promote Osteogenic Differentiation
  of hVICs(A) Differentially expressed genes (filtered by |fold change| >2-fold; P <
  0.05) in the case of SNHG3 knockdown and SNHG3 overexpression through 2 RNA sequencing.
  (B) Gene set enrichment analysis revealed the TGF-β signaling pathway was significantly
  upregulated in condition of SNHG3 overexpression with adenovirus compared with Ad-GFP.
  (C and D) The mRNA level of BMP2 in hVICs transfected with ASO-SNHG3 or Ad-SNHG3
  (n = 6/group). (E and F) The protein level of BMP2 and pSmad1 in hVICs transfected
  with ASO-SNHG3 or Ad-SNHG3 (n = 6/group). (G) The down-regulation of protein levels
  of osteoblastic differentiation markers (OPN, RUNX2, OCN) induced by ASO-SNHG3 in
  hVICs were efficiently reversed by adding BMP2 stimulation (50 ng/mL) (n = 6/group).
  (H) The upregulation of protein levels of osteoblastic differentiation markers caused
  by overexpression of SNHG3 was partially reversed by the BMP2 pathway inhibitor
  LDN-193189 (100 ng/mL) (n = 6/group). (I) Representative phosphorylated smad1/5
  immunofluorescence staining in red and quantification in ApoE−/− mice treated with
  ASO-SNHG3 and ASO-NC aortic valve leaflets. Nuclei are stained blue with DAPI. Scale
  bar, 75 μm. Values are mean ± SEM. Unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test for C to F
  and I. One-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test for G and H, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001. DAPI = 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide; TGF = transforming
  growth factor; other abbreviations as in , , and .
