caption: Expression of ARL4C in pan-cancer and renal cancer and its relationship with
  the clinical characteristics of KIRC patients based on TCGA database. (a) ARL4C
  expression in pan-cancer was explored using TCGA database. (b) Comparison of ARL4C
  expression in pan-cancer tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Red represents
  tumor tissues, and blue represents normal tissues. (c) The UALCAN website was applied
  to compare the expression of ARL4C mRNA in primary KIRC tissues versus normal kidney
  tissues. (d–j) The relationship between ARL4C expression and different cancer stages,
  lymph node metastasis status, patient's sex, patient's age, tumor grade, KIRC subtype,
  and patient's race is based on the UALCAN website. (k) Effect of ARL4C mRNA expression
  on KIRC patient survival. (l) Effect of ARL4C expression and sex on KIRC patient
  survival. (m) Effect of ARL4C expression and tumor grade on KIRC patient survival.
  (n) Effect of ARL4C expression and race on KIRC patient survival. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
