caption: 'High UBE2L3 expression correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis in
  LUAD. The expression profiling and survival analysis in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. A.
  Box plot analysis of the UBE2L3 mRNA expression in LUAD tissues and normal tissues
  from the TCGA. B. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the overall survival in LUAD patients
  based on the expression of UBE2L3. C. Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC)
  images of UBE2L3 expression in the normal tissues and LUAD tissues with or without
  lymph node metastasis. Magnification: 40× (scar bar =200 μm) and 200× (scar bar
  =50 μm). D. H-score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score and the percentage
  of positive cells (range, 0-300). UBE2L3 was significantly overexpressed in LUAD
  tissues with lymph node metastasis compared to the LUAD tissues without lymph node
  metastasis. LN-, lymph node metastasis negative; LN+, lymph node metastasis positive;
  ***P<0.001.'
