caption: Depletion of TgSUFC affects in vitro growth of the tachyzoites irreversibly.A,
  plaque assays were carried out by infecting HFF monolayers with the TgSUFC2-HA conditional
  knockdown and complemented cell lines. They were grown for 7 days ± ATc. B, measurements
  of lysis plaque areas highlight a significant defect in the lytic cycle when TgSUFC
  is depleted. Values are means of n = 3 experiments ±SD. Mean value of a TATi ΔKu80
  control grown in the presence of ATc (not shown on the left) was set to 100% as
  a reference. Two-tailed Student’s t test p-values are indicated. The scale bar represents
  2 mm. C, plaque assays for the TgSUFC mutant was performed as described in (A),
  but ATc was washed out after 7 days (7days+ATc 7days-ATc) or not (14days+ATc), and
  parasites were left to grow for an extra 7 days. No plaque was observed upon ATc
  removal. Shown are images from one representative out of three independent experiments.
  The scale bar represents 1 mm. D, TgSUFC mutant and complemented cell lines, as
  well as their parental cell line and the TATi ΔKu80 control, were grown in HFF in
  the presence or absence of ATc for 48 h and subsequently allowed to invade and grow
  in new HFF cells for an extra 24 h in the presence of ATc. Parasites per vacuole
  were then counted. Values are means ±SD from n = 3 independent experiments for which
  200 vacuoles were counted for each condition. ATc, anhydrotetracycline; HA, hemagglutinin;
  TATi, tetracycline-inducible transactivator.
