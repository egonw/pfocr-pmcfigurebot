caption: 'SS extract inhibits LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression and
  production. (a) Real-time PCR analyses to determine changes in mRNA levels of Il1b,
  Il6, and Tnf following treatment with the SS extract (SS) in LPS-stimulated RAW
  264.7 cells. (b) ELISA to determine changes in the production of IL-6 and TNF-α
  following treatment with the SS extract in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The bars
  represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗: P < 0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗:
  P < 0.001 by comparison with the indicated group. SS, Sargassum siliquastrum; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide.'
