caption: Hypothetical scheme of the molecular evolution of the MVA pathways.Arrows
  placed from left to right indicate the reactions of enzymes used to convert MVA
  into IPP in each pathway. The events that are likely to have occurred through the
  evolution of the pathways are shown in gray boxes with slim arrows that indicate
  the expected direction of evolution. IPP isomerase; MVA, mevalonate.
