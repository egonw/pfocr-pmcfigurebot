  severity
caption: (A – I) Comparisons of pathway module scores across four conditions in platelets.
  The included modules contain genes related to (A) Coagulation, (B) Platelet activation,
  (C) OXPHOS, (D) Glycolysis, E) MHC Class II, (F) Translation initiation, (G) Response
  to type I IFN, (H) Response to IFN gamma, (I) Response to IFN beta. (J – O) Pathway
  module scores comparison between T0 vs. T6 in platelets. The included modules contain
  genes related to (J) Positive regulation of hemostasis, (K) COVID 19, (L) Response
  to type I IFN, (M) Response to IFN beta, (N) OXPHOS, (O) Glycolysis. The differences
  in scores associated with adjusted p-values below 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001
  are indicated as *, **, ***, and ****, respectively and “ns” – not significant.
  The significance analysis was performed using Wilcoxon tests.
