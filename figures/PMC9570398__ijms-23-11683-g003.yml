caption: 'Untargeted metabolomics analysis of differential metabolites in inflorescences
  of WT and bhlh010 bhlh089 double mutant. (A–D) PCA, OPLS-DA analysis, and system
  stability investigation. PCA is an unsupervised model analysis method, and it can
  reflect the real difference among groups more reliably and eliminate outliers. (A)
  The overall PCA scores plots. The yellow dotted line is the bhlh010 bhlh089 (D1,
  blue square) double mutant inflorescence sample, and the blue dotted line is the
  WT (W1, red triangle) inflorescence sample. (B) OPLS-DA score plots. The black dotted
  line is the bhlh010 bhlh089 (D1) double mutant inflorescence sample, and the purple
  dotted line is the WT (W1) inflorescence sample. In the model of positive mode,
  R2X = 0.716, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.987. The model is thought to be reliable if these
  parameter values > 0.4. (C) OPLS-DA models were validated by permutation tests to
  access whether the modes were overfit. R2 = 0.827, Q2 = −0.734. (D) S-plots of Group
  W1 and Group D1. The points far from the origin contribute to intergroup difference
  significantly and have lager VIP values. The above (A–D) horizontal and vertical
  coordinates have no practical significance. The above only shows the results of
  positive ion accumulation mode. (E) Cluster analysis of total differential metabolites.
  Differential metabolites were screened out by the VIP (variable importance in projection)
  value of the OPLS-DA model (VIP ≥ 1) and independent sample t-test (p < 0.05). Adduct
  manner: [M+H] + and [M+Na]+ were selected in positive mode, [M-H]− in negative mode.
  Mass error value: 30 PPM. (F) The bubble plot of significantly reduced metabolic
  pathways by the metabolomics of bhlh010 bhlh089 double mutant inflorescence. Each
  circle denotes a metabolic pathway, with the red color indicating a higher −log
  (p) value and the yellow color indicating a lower −log (p) value. The size of the
  circle indicates the pathway impact value in the topological analysis. (G) The top
  10 differential metabolites were increase and decrease in WT (W1) and bhlh010 bhlh089
  double mutant (D1) inflorescence ranking. The red words in E, F and G represent
  metabolic pathways and metabolites that might be involved in pollen development.'
