caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells. The S glycoprotein of the
  virion binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and enters
  the target cell through an endosomal pathway. Following the entry, the viral RNA
  is translated to produce pp1a and pp1ab, which are then cleaved by the proteases
  (RdRp, PLpro, and 3CLpro). During the RNA replication and transcription, genomic
  RNA and structural proteins (N, M, E, and S) were produced. Following the production
  of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, nucleocapsids are assembled in the cytoplasm
  and followed by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)â€“Golgi intermediate
  compartments. Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis.
  Red lines indicate possible antiviral mechanisms of bioactive compounds (figure
