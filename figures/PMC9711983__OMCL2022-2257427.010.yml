caption: NS1619 attenuated the inflammatory response and inflammatory pathway in the
  brain 3 days after TBI. (a–c) NS1619 treatment markedly increased arginase1-positive
  microglia/macrophages and decreased iNOS-positive microglia/macrophages and GFAP-positive
  cells (scale bar = 20 μm). (d–f) Quantification of immunofluorescence images (n
  = 6/group). (g–j) NS1619 significantly increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10
  but decreased proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in brain tissue after
  TBI (n = 7/group). (k,l) Representative WB bands and quantification of relative
  protein expression for NF-κB/p-p65 (n = 6/group). (m) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of NF-κB/p-p65 staining (red) (n = 3/group, scale bar = 50 μm). Data are
  shown as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
