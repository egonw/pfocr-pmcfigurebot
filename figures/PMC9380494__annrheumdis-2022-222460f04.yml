caption: Enrichment analysis for six autoimmune and allergic diseases. (A) A heatmap
  describing the 292 immune cell-type enrichment using LDSC referring ImmGen gene
  expression data. The row and column are hierarchically clustered. The row annotations
  are coloured based on five cell types (B cell, T cell, NK cell, myeloid cell, and
  others), and the column annotations are coloured according to whether it is an autoimmune
  or an allergic disease. (B) The pathway network of immune system in Reactome database.
  The nodes are coloured according to whether the individual GWAS data are significantly
  enriched at a significance level of 0.05/150. For the sake of clarity, only nodes
  that have at least one enriched disease are shown. AD, atopic dermatitis; BA, bronchial
  asthma; BBJ, BioBank Japan; GD, Graveâ€™s diseases; GWAS, genome-wide association
  study; LDSC, linkage disequilibrium score regression; PO, pollinosis; RA, rheumatoid
  arthritis; T1D, type 1 diabetes; UKB, UK Biobank.
article_title: Multi-trait and cross-population genome-wide association studies across
  autoimmune and allergic diseases identify shared and distinct genetic component.
