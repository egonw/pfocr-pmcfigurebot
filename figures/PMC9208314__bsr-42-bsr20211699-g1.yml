caption: A ternary complex formed of eIF2-GTP and a methionylated initiator tRNA is
  recruited to the 40S ribosomal subunit by various eIFs to form a 43 S PIC. Facilitated
  by other eIFs, the 43 S PIC is loaded onto a target mRNA molecule and scans the
  mRNA sequence for a start codon. Upon recognition of a start codon, eIF2-GTP is
  hydrolysed and released in complex with eIF5. eIF5B accommodates the binding of
  the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S subunit forming the elongation ready 80S ribosome.
  eIF2- GDP-eIF5 is recycled to eIF2-GTP by eIF2B.
