caption: FibromiRs. (A) The core mechanisms of fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Multiple
  cell types (e.g., fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, epithelial cells, and macrophages)
  are involved. The pathophysiological mechanisms include inflammation, epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix accumulation, and metastasis. (B)
  MiR-21 is a diagnostic biomarker for multiple cancers, including breast, pancreatic,
  colorectal, and prostate. MiR-21 stimulates cardiac fibroblasts by targeting Mmp2
  and the PTEN pathway, leading to the progression of myocardial disease. (C) MiR-22
  induces the liver fibrosis through BMP7 leading to progression into hepatocellular
  carcinoma. In the heart, miR-22 promotes cardiac fibrosis by targeting Sirt1 and
  HDAC4. Figure created with BioRender.com, accessed on 24 October 2022.
