caption: Pathway enrichment analysis and pathway hit to hub genes. (A) The top 39
  signaling pathways associated with 51 potentially acting target genes. Pathways
  with a P-values < 0.05 were identified. The spot size represents the number of genes,
  and the color represents the P-value. The horizontal coordinate represents the generation,
  which is the ratio of the number of intersecting genes enriched in the pathway to
  the total intersecting genes; the vertical coordinate represents the name of the
  enriched pathway. (B) Signaling pathways associated with hub genes. The horizontal
  coordinate represents the number of hub gene hits on the pathway, and the vertical
  coordinate represents the pathway name.
