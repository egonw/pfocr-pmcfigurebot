caption: Retinoblastoma (RB)-dependent cell cycle arrest. In normal cells RB is phosphorylated
  by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Enhancement of E2F transcription factor activity
  occurs, which is required for cell cycle progression. In senescent cells, CDKs are
  inhibited by P16 or P21, which can be activated as a result of DNA damage response
  (DDR) through ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR)/ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated kinase (ATM) → checkpoint kinase 1 /checkpoint kinase 2 (CKH1/CHK2) → P53
  pathway. E2F repression occurs, which leads to the cell cycle arrest maintained
  by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS).
