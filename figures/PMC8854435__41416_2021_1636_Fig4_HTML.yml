figure_title: V9302 inhibits GD2 expression, BCSC function and the glutathione (GSH)
  pathway in TNBC cells
caption: a, h SUM159 (50,000 cells/well) or MDA-MB-231 (75,000 cells/well) were plated
  in 24-well plate treated with or without V9302 (small-molecule inhibitor of ASCT2)
  in a dose-dependent manner (0, 5, 10, and 20 μM) for 72 h, and GD2 expression was
  measured by flow cytometry. b, i SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 103 cells/well)
  were seeded into soft-agar medium containing different concentrations of V9302 (0,
  5, 10 and 20 μM). After 3 weeks, the colonies were fixed and stained by the MTT
  method. Tumorigenesis was assessed by counting the resulting colonies by an automated
  colony counter. c, j SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded (5 × 103 per well) into
  low-adherent dishes containing MammoCult medium with different concentrations (0,
  5, 10 and 20 μM) of V9302. After 3 weeks, the mammospheres were stained with MTT
  reagent and counted by an automated colony counter. d, k SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells
  were cultured in 24-well trans-well chambers, using membrane inserts with 8-μm pores
  in DMEM containing 1% FBS. The cells (1 × 104 per chamber) were seeded into the
  upper chambers for 8 h. Membranes were fixed with 2% formalin and stained with DAPI.
  Fluorescent images were captured using the EVOS automated microscope. One-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed for GD2 expression, taking untreated
  cells as the control. ***p = 0.001, **p = 0.002 and *p = 0.033. e, l Combinatorial
  effect of V9302 and 2-DG on TNBC cells. SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with either V9302 (10 μM) or 2-DG (10 mM) alone or in combination for 72 h. GD2
  expression was analysed using flow cytometry analysis. Unpaired t test was performed
  between untreated and V9302-treated cells in the presence or absence of 2-DG. ***p = 0.001,
  **p = 0.002 and *p = 0.033. f, m SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with
  V9302 (0, 5, 10 and 20 μM) for 72 h. Total GSH was measured using an assay kit and
  end-point reading method. g, n After 72 h treatment with V9302, cells were collected
  and incubated with ROS detection reagent (1 μM) using an Enzo ROS-1D Detection Kit.
  ROS levels were measured using flow cytometry.
