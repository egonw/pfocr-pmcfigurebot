caption: DO‐SRS imaging of lipid metabolism in the fat body of mutant flies at (a)
  7‐day and (b) 30‐day posteclosion. The ratiometric images (CDL/CH2) display the
  ratio of CD signal at 2143 cm−1 (newly synthesized lipids) to the signal at 2850 cm−1
  (CH2 stretching of lipids). The genetic downregulation of InR/PI3K pathway (Pten,
  ppl‐Gal4>UAS‐Pten; InR DN, ppl‐Gal4>UAS‐InR DN) showed higher lipid metabolism than
  control, and upregulation of InR/PI3K pathway (InR del, ppl‐Gal4>UAS‐InR del) led
  to reduced lipid metabolism in both young and old flies
