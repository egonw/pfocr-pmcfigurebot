caption: 'ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis identify BbOsrR3 target genes. A Identification
  of BbOsrR3 (gene promoter) targets by comparison of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq under the
  normal, H2O2 (4 mM), and menadione (MND, 60 μM)-stressed conditions for 30 min.
  B MEME analysis indicating the likely binding sequence of BbOsrR3. C Partial annotation
  of identified BbOsrR3 gene targets and their expression patterns. D EMSA verification
  of two identified BbOsrR3 targets: Fus3 and a hypothetical protein gene (BBA_06338)
  with indicated BbOsrR3 protein concentrations. The promoter region of each target
  harboring mutated binding motif was used as the scrambled DNA sequence control (Mutated
  promoter) as detailed in the “” section. E Model of BbOsrR3 regulation of the Fus3-MAP
  kinase pathway via (negatively) targeting Fus3 and affecting expression of the Ste2,
  Sst2, and Msg5 genes. Upregulated genes in the ΔBbOsrR3 mutant are shadowed in red'
