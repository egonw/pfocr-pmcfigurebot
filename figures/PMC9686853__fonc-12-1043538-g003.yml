caption: Integrin α6β4 promotes recruitment of p53 and 53BP1 to chromatin. (A) BT549
  cells (EV and β4) were plated on laminin-1 and treated with 10μM cisplatin for 24h.
  Subcellular protein fractions were immunoblotted with DDR proteins as indicated.
  Tubulin was used as the marker for total protein, p84 was used to mark nuclear fractions,
  and Histone H2B used to mark chromatin fractions. (B) Fold changes in noted phosphorylation
  in chromatin bound from (A) are reported after normalization to Histone H2B and
  reported relative to BT549-EV control treatment. (C) Cells treated as in (A) were
  immunostained for phospho-p53 S15 and phospho-53BP1 S1778, as indicated, using DAPI
  as a counterstain (scale bars, 20µm). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005.
