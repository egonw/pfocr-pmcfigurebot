caption: OPRP-transfected Raw264.7 and TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. Raw264.7 (OPRP−)
  and OPRP-transfected Raw264.7 (OPRP+) cells were stimulated by LPS (1 μg/mL) for
  16 h. Differences between OPRP− and OPRP+ cells in confocal fluorescence microscopy
  were then compared. (A) OPRP-transfected Raw264.7 cells were stained with Alexa
  Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody. Hoechst 33,342 (blue, nucleus) was counterstained
  and images were merged to distinguish OPRP expression in the cytosol (arrow indicates
  a magnified single cell picked from a merged picture, whereas outer and inner triangle
  indicates cell membrane and nuclear, respectively). Scale bar, 20 μm. (B) Intensity
  profiles (a region of interest, ROI) obtained with ImageJ plot analysis. (C–E) TLR4-mediated
  NF-κB signaling (phosphorylation of ERK and IκB-α) was assessed by Western blot
  analysis. (F) NF-κB reporter gene assay was performed in THP1-Lucia cells as described
  in Materials and Methods in the presence of LPS or OPRP for 24 h. Cells were pre-treated
  with PD98059 (150 μM), SB203580 (100 μM), or TAK-242 (5 μg/mL) for 2 h before treatment
  with LPS and OPRP. Results are presented as means ± standard deviations from three
  separate experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. non-transfected
  Ctrl. +++ p < 0.001 vs. LPS. ǂǂǂ p < 0.001 vs. OPRP.
