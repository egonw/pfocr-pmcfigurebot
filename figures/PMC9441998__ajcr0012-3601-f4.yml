caption: 'Cordycepin, radiation, and the combination treatment regulated cell cycle
  distribution in MA-10 cells. MA-10 cells were treated without or with 25 μM cordycepin
  and 4 Gy radiation for 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hr, respectively. Cells were fixed and
  then stained with propidium iodide (PI), and cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry.
  The distribution and percentage of cells in sub G1, G1, S and G2/M phase of the
  cell cycle are illustrated (A-G). MA-10 cells were treated without or with different
  concentrations of cordycepin (25 and 100 µM) and radiation (4 Gy) for 24 hr, respectively.
  Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, CDK4, CDK2 and CDK1 were detected by
  western blotting (H-O). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 indicate significant statistical
  difference compared to the control group. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 indicate
  significant statistical difference compared to the combination treatment group.'
