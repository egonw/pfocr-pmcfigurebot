caption: '- Proposed mechanism of endotheliitis. The endothelium maintains homeostasis,
  regulating systemic blood flow tissue perfusion in conjunction with smooth muscle
  cells and pericytes, promoting vasodilation, regulation of vascular permeability,
  and controlling antithrombotic and immune effects. Viral infection primarily affects
  vascular endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and pulmonary macrophages, causing
  hyper inflammation and attenuated antiviral responses. There is evidence for the
  pre-activation of virions by the proprotein convertase Furin during entry into host
  cells. Dysregulation in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the bradykinin-kallikrein
  pathway leads to downregulation of ACE2, resulting from ADAM17-mediated seeding.
  Angiotensin II promotes microvascular thrombosis, coagulopathy, and hypofibrinolysis,
  subsequently recruiting inflammatory mediators.'
