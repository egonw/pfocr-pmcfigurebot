caption: 'Butein attenuates oxidative stress responses in H2O2-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.
  Intracellular ROS production was assessed by a DCFH-DA staining (a) and the measurement
  of green fluorescence intensity (b) using cells treated with butein and/or H2O2.
  The arrow indicates the cells in which ROS accumulated. (c) Western blot analysis
  for the expression levels of antioxidants including SOD1, SOD2, catalase, and β-actin
  (loading control). The band densities of SOD1 (d), SOD2 (e), and catalase (f) proteins
  were calculated with HD imaging software. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM
  in triplicate. ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 vs. control group. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. H2O2-only group. Cont; control, Bu; butein. Scale
  bar, 100 μm.'
