caption: 'Melatonin can alleviate damage to mouse testes and Leydig cells induced
  by cisplatin. (A) Experimental design. (B) Changes in the body weight of mice. (C)
  Images of mouse testes sizes. (D) Images of mouse epididymides sizes. (E) Mouse
  epididymides stained with H&E (scale bar = 50 μm). (F) Mouse testicular cross sections
  stained with H&E (scale bar = 50 μm). (G) Testicular cross sections stained with
  TUNEL to show apoptosis (scale bar = 50 μm). (H) 3β-HSD staining was used to immunolocalize
  Leydig cells. (I) Number of Leydig cells. (J) H&E-stained mouse sperm (scale bar
  = 50 μm). (K) Mouse testicular weights. (L) Mouse epididymides weights. (M) Testosterone
  level in mouse testes. (N) Epididymal sperm cells were counted. CP, cisplatin. CP
  + Mel, cisplatin + melatonin. Mel, melatonin. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
  (N = 8 per group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with controls. # p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01 compared with the CP group.'
