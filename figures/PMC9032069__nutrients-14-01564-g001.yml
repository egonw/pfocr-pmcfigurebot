caption: Ginsenoside Rh4 inhibits GC metastasis in vitro. Wound healing assays (A)
  and transwell migration (B) and invasion (C) assays were performed to investigate
  the migration and invasion ability alteration of BC cells with the treatment of
  Rh4. Data were processed using ImageJ software (NH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Quantification
  charts are listed on the right. Statistics are exhibited as the mean ± SD of triplicate
  independent experiments; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
