caption: Association of SMO mutation with enhanced tumor immunogenicity. (A–C) Box
  plot depicting the distributions of tumor mutation burden (TMB), single nucleotide
  variant (SNV) neoantigen load, and insertion–deletion (INDEL) neoantigen load in
  SMO mutant (SMO_MUT) and SMO wild-type (SMO_WT) tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas
  (TCGA) cohort (two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test). (D) Mutation rates of the DNA damage
  repair (DDR) pathway genes between the SMO mutant (SMO_MUT) and wild-type (SMO_WT)
  subgroups in the TCGA cohort (two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test). (E) Box plot depicting
  the distribution of the microsatellite instability (MSI) scores in SMO_MUT and SMO_WT
  tumors in the TCGA cohort (two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test). (F) MSI-H percentages
  in SMO_MUT or SMO_WT samples in colorectal cancer (CRC), stomach adenocarcinoma
  (STAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC; two-tailed Fisher’s exact
  test). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. ns, no significant.
