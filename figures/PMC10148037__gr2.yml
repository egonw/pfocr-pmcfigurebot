caption: Concentrations of (A) malic acid, and (B) citric acid, and changes in (C)
  phosphoenolpyruvate kinase (PEPC) activity measured at 48h, 1 week, and 7 weeks
  following defoliation in fruits under control (blue bars) and early defoliation
  (ED) (orange bars) treatments. For each parameter, the corresponding period in the
  fruit growth is also given in days after anthesis. Data are mean values (±SD) of
  four independent measurements (n = 4). Different lowercase letters indicate significant
  differences between treatment and along the development stage (P < 0.05). (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
