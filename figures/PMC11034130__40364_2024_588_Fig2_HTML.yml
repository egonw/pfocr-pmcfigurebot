caption: Lipid metabolism enhances treg-mediated immunosuppression. Lipid metabolism
  is conducive to the expression of PD-1, CTLA-4, ICOS, and FOXP3 in Tregs, enhancing
  immunosuppressive ability. Free fatty acids uptake enhances FAO through activating
  the PPAR pathway. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway-mediated glycolysis is conducive
  to the enhancement of FAO. PTEN, AMPK, PP2A, HIF2Î±, and FOXP3 are inhibitory molecules
  of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway, which attenuate glycolysis. Oleic acids, increased
  reactive oxygen species levels, and PD1/CTLA-4 signal transduction are beneficial
  to the expression of FOXP3, inhibit glycolysis, and promote FAO. FAS is essential
  for the expression of immunosuppressive molecules. Here, a large amount of acetyl-coa
  produced by glycolysis can be used as a substrate for the synthesis of fatty acids
  and cholesterol, where mTORC1 has been reported to upregulate expression of CTLA-4,
  ICOS by activating the mevalonate pathway. Activation of the mevalonate pathway
  is also associated with enhanced PD-1 expression
