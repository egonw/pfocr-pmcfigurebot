caption: Proposed pathway in the study. We find that the ROS scavenger alleviates
  anesthesia/surgery-induced CypA/MMP9 activation, BBB damage, and delirium-like behavior
  in mice. Furthermore, CypA inhibitor prevents BBB damage and delirium-like behavior
  by suppressing CypA/MMP9 pathway. These findings suggest that the ROS mediated CypA/MMP-9
  pathway is a mechanism for inducing BBB injury and delirium-like behavior after
  anesthesia/surgery in aged mice.

  CypA/MMP9 signaling and inducing blood-brain barrier impairment in aged mice following
  anesthesia and surgery.
