caption: Tapinarof treatment affects Tfh expansion in vitro through JAK2‐STAT3 signaling.
  Spleen lymphocytes were isolated from MRL/lpr mice and cultured for 3 days under
  different treatment conditions. (A) Pseudo‐color plots in the left panel show the
  percentages of Tfh cell subsets in gated CD4+ T cells in each study group. The results
  of the statistical analysis are shown on the right (n = 5–6). (B) Real‐time qPCR
  analysis of Bcl6, Cxcr5, Icos, Il‐6, CD40l, Il‐7r, and Maf mRNA expression in each
  study group (n = 3–4). qPCR analysis was performed in triplicate in three separate
  runs for each gene expression. (C) P‐JAK2 and P‐STAT3 immunoblots in the spleens
  of tapinarof‐ treated and control mice. The data were obtained from two independent
  experiments. Error bars represent SD. Each symbol in the graphs represents an individual
  mouse; *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001.
