caption: Illustrations of putative promoter regions 5′ of the ATG start codon in the  Brachypodium
  distachyon  antifreeze protein (AFP) genes BdIRI1‐7 and the known cold‐regulated
  promoter sequence of the rice,  Oryza sativa , gene OsMYB1R35. The analysis extended
  until the stop codon of the nearest upstream gene. Cis‐regulatory elements are annotated
  with strand positions shown relative to the sequence encoding the ATG start. Colored
  boxes correspond to canonical cold response related and drought‐resistant element
  motifs (CRT/DRE; blue), the stress hormone, abscisic acid‐responsive elements (ABREs;
  red), the cold response pathway inducer of C‐repeat binding factor expression 1
  (ICEr1; gray), low‐temperature response elements (LTREs; yellow), and the WRKY stress
  transcription factors recognition W‐box motifs (purple).
