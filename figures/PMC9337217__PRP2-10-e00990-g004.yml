caption: Both SP(1–9)‐COOH triggered calcium mobilization and MC degranulation are
  significantly ablated in MRGPRX2‐KD LAD2 cells. SP and SP(1–9)‐COOH activation of
  both Ca2+ mobilization (A) and degranulation (B) were strongly inhibited by MRGPRX2
  knockdown. (A) LAD2 cells were loaded with FURA‐2 and then stimulated with peptides
  and peak calcium ratios measured. Data shown are means ± S.E.M., n = 6–7. (B) Mast
  cell degranulation was measured by quantifying β‐hexosaminidase release, which is
  shown as a % of total cellular release. Data shown are means ± S.E.M., n = 6–7.
  Activation of the IgE‐dependent pathway (NIP‐BSA [30 ng/ml]) was unaffected by MRGPRX2
  knockdown. For statistical analysis, a two‐way ANOVA was conducted with Bonferroni
  multiple comparison post hoc test. Each MRGPRX2 KD response was compared to the
  respective response in the LAD2 WT cells. **p < .001, ***p < .0005, ****p < .000005.
