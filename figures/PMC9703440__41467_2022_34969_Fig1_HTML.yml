caption: a Flow cytometry analysis of GCB cells (CD3−B220+Fas+GL7+) and PCs (B220lowCD138+)
  in the spleen of p38αfl/flCD19cre and p38αfl/fl mice (8–10 weeks, n = 7 per group)
  at day 7.5 after immunization (i.p.) with OVA/Alum/LPS. Summary of the percentage
  and number of GCB cells and PCs. b Representative immunofluorescence images of germinal
  centers stained for IgD (naive B cells, green), GL7 (GCB cells, red) and CD3 (T
  cells, white) in the spleen of OVA/Alum/LPS-immunized mice (n = 3 per group) at
  day 7.5 post immunization. Unimmunized mice (n = 3 per group) were used as controls.
  Scale bars, 50 or 400 µm. The area occupied by GL7+ cells in B cell zone was calculated
  and shown as percentage of B cell zone. c, d Flow cytometry analysis of NP-specific
  GCB cells (CD3−B220+Fas+GL7+NP+) and NP-specific plasmablasts (B220lowCD138+NP+)
  in the spleen at day 14 post immunization with NP-OVA/Alum (i.p) (n = 5 per group)
  (c). NP-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were measured by ELISpot assay
  (d). e p38αfl/flCD19cre and p38αfl/fl mice were immunized with NP-OVA/Alum (i.p.)
  (n = 10 per group), followed by secondary immunization with NP-OVA (i.p.) at day
  120 after primary immunization. Serum was collected at indicated time points, and
  NP-specific antibody concentration (fold change) was determined by ELISA. Each symbol
  represents an individual mouse. Small horizontal lines indicate the mean (±s.d.).
  Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests. Source data are provided as a
  Source Data file.
