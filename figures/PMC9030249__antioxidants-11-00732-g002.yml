caption: SPRC ameliorates RA symptoms in AIA rat model. (A) The schematic representation
  of in vivo experiment. (B) Representative right hind paws in each group. (C) Right
  hind paws were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to animal micro-computed
  tomography (micro-CT). Bone erosion parts are indicated by white arrows. (D) Bone
  mineral density of the heels was analyzed by micro-CT. (E) The body weight, (F)
  hind paw volume, (G) arthritis score, and (H) disease incidence were statistically
  analyzed. (I) Ankles of right hind paws were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
  Typical soft tissue hyperplasia and bone destruction are indicated by black arrows
  (bar, 1 mm; magnification, 40×). Bars indicate the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. In (C), n = 5 in each group. In (D–F), n = 15 in each group.
