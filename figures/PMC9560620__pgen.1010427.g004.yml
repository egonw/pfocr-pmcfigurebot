caption: (A-B) Wild type embryos carrying the sna-rg-mCherry (red) and 10xSTAT-GFP
  (green) reporter genes. (A) At st10, embryos present patches of green staining in
  the maxillary and labial segments at the position where the gland primordia will
  become activated. Weak sna-rg expression starts to appear. (B) At st11, when sna-rg-mCherry
  is strongly activated, 10xSTAT-GFP expression has faded from the maxilla while is
  maintained in the labium. Note that 10xSTAT-GFP expression is also activated in
  the tracheal primordia. (C-I) upd mRNA in situ hybridization in st10-st11 embryos.
  (C) A wild type early st11 embryo showing upd mRNA in the maxillary and labial segments
  is restricted to two patches where the CA and the PG form. (D) At late st11, upd
  mRNA expression only remains in the PG (asterisk marks the position where the CA
  primordium is located). (E) hh null mutants lose maxillary and labial upd transcription
  (asterisks), which remains in the tracheal primordia. (F) In wg null mutants, upd
  transcription is extended in the maxillary and labial segments (arrows), as well
  as expanding around the tracheal primordia. (G) Dfd Scr mutants lose maxillary and
  labial upd transcription (asterisks). Embryos in (G) are also Abd-B homozygous mutant
  to allow distinguishing unambiguously the triple Dfd Scr Abd-B homozygous embryos
  by the absence of upd expression in the A8 posterior spiracle primordium. (H) upd
  expression in a control embryo at st10. (I) upd expression in an embryo expressing
  the activator isoform of Ci in a st10 embryo. Scale bars 50 μm.
