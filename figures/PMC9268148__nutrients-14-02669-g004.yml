caption: HCA induces DNA fragmentation and G2/M arrest in K562 cells. (A) K562 cells
  were treated for 48 h and 72 h with different concentrations of HCA, as indicated.
  Cells were collected, treated with RNase, and stained with PI. Cell cycle distribution
  was then detected through flow cytometry system (BD FACS Celesta). Graphs were obtained
  with data analysis through ModFit LT software (FlowJo v10, Ashland, OR, USA). The
  fitted cell populations in G1, S and G2/M phases are represented in purple, light
  yellow, and light green. (B) Bar graph showing cell cycle distribution at 48 h.
  Treatment with 10 mM HCA leads to a significant delay in the cell cycle progression
  at the G2/M phase. ** p < 0.01; unpaired t-test (C) Bar graph showing cell cycle
  distribution at 72 h. Treatment with 5 mM and 10 mM HCA lead to a significant delay
  in the cell cycle progression at G2/M phase. (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; unpaired
  t-test (D) K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of HCA, as indicated.
  Samples were lysed and prepared following the appropriate protocol and then DNA
  fragmentation was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis (2%). M, 500 bp DNA ladder;
  DNA, genomic DNA standard; L, 1 kb DNA ladder.
