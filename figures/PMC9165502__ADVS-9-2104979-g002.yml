caption: Intracellular astrocyte‐relevant pathways required for transduction by rAAV9P1
  identified by unbiased genome‐wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening of U251MG cells.
  A) Experimental workflow for genome‐wide CRISPR/Cas9 genome knockout screening of
  U251MG cells. U251MG cells stably expressing Cas9 (U251MG‐Cas9) were transduced
  with a lentiviral human GeCKOv2 sgRNA library A[] and subjected to antibiotic selection
  to establish the single‐knockout cell pool (U251MG‐Cas9_GeCKO). The U251MG‐Cas9_GeCKO
  cell pool was exposed to rAAV9P1‐eYFP vectors and eYFP‐negative cells selected by
  FACS sorting. Genomic DNA was isolated from this eYFP‐negative subpopulation and
  the U251MG‐Cas9_GeCKO cell pool (= unsorted control) and sgRNA sequences were identified
  by NGS. sgRNA sequences significantly enriched in the eYFP‐negative subpopulation
  compared to the unsorted control were used to identify an initial set of 2715 genes
  with enriched corresponding sgRNAs in the eYFP‐negative cell subpopulation. From
  this initial set, a final set of 1326 genes was extracted by more stringent selection
  criteria (identification by ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 2‐fold enrichment) and used for GO‐term
  analysis. B) GO‐term and pathway analysis reveals enrichment of astrocyte‐relevant
  pathways and biological processes in the eYFP‐negative subpopulation. The yellow
  disk represents the final set of 1326 genes (≥ 2‐fold‐enriched sgRNAs, ≥ 100 reads)
  and the strong brain and brain disease association of this gene set (MeSH terms
  and tissues). The vertical grayscales indicate rank position of the astrocyte‐relevant terms
  within the total number of associated terms for pathways/associated pathways (left)
  and biological processes (right, only top 30% included).
