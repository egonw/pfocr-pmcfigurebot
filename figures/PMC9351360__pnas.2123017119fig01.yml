caption: S. aureus infection induces a cell type–specific response that is muted compared
  with cytokine treatment. (A) Schematic of the experimental design for RNA-Seq performed
  with PMNs, CD14+ monocytes, MDMs, and MDDCs isolated from the same donors. RNA was
  isolated 4 h after infection. (B) Principal component analysis was performed using
  the 1,000 most variable genes among all samples. For each sample, principal component
  1 (PC1) and principal component 2 (PC2) are plotted. Shapes denote cell type (▪,
  MDDCs; ●, MDMs; ▴, monocytes; ♦, PMNs). Color denotes treatment (gray, buffer; red,
  S. aureus infected). n = 3 donors. (C) Venn diagram of the number of genes whose
  transcription was significantly altered by S. aureus exposure for the four cell
  types. Percentages are the percentages of all differentially expressed genes. DEG,
  differentially expressed gene. (D–G) Bar graphs of the number of genes that are
  significantly down-regulated (blue) and up-regulated (red) in comparison with buffer
  treatment for S. aureus–infected, IFN-γ–treated, and IL-4–treated PMNs (D), monocytes
  (E), macrophages (F), and DCs (G). Significantly differentially expressed genes
  are considered genes with a |log2 fold change (log2FC)| ≥ 1 and an adjusted P value
  ≤ 0.05. (H) Heat map of log2FC of genes that are significantly differentially expressed
  in at least one treatment in PMNs. The histograms show the distribution of log2FCs
  within each treatment for PMNs. (I) Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis
  of all genes found to be significantly differentially expressed in at least one
  cell type. Pathways are separated by broad categories. Within each category, pathways
  are ranked by percentage of differentially expressed genes. Count indicates the
  number of differentially expressed genes in each GO pathway. IS, immune system;
  DE, differentially expressed.
