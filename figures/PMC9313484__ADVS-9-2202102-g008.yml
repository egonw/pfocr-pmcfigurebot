caption: 'Mg2+ promotes neurite outgrowth in a concentration‐dependent manner by activating
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and upregulating Sema5b expression. A–F) Primary
  culture of DRG neurons treated with varying Mg2+ concentrations (Ctrl, 10, 20, 30,
  40, and 50 mM). G) Gene expression heatmap of axon guidance molecules and neurotrophic
  factors (n = 3). H) mRNA expression levels of NGF, Sema3b, Sema3e, Sema4c, Sema5b,
  NetrinG1, EFNA2, EFNB3 (mean ± standard deviation; one‐way ANOVA and Tukey''s post
  hoc tests, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 compared to the mRNA levels in the Ctrl group;
  n = 3 per group). I) Protein expression levels of NF200, GAP43, Sema5b, and GAPDH
  assessed by western blotting. J) Primary culture of DRG neurons treated with additional
  Mg2+ ions, LY294002, or DMSO. K) Protein expression levels of pPI3K, Akt, and p‐Akt
  in four groups (Ctrl, Mg2+, Mg2+ with LY294002, and DMSO). L) Primary culture of
  DRG neurons with additional Mg2+, Lipo: Sema5b‐siRNA or Lipo: Blank; M) Western
  blot results of GAP43, Sema5b expression in four groups. DRG, dorsal root ganglia;
  DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Ctrl, control.'
