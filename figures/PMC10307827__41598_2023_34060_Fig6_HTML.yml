caption: 'Amifostine (AMI) inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in bleomycin (BLM)-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis. (a) The effect of AMI on p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, PI3K, Akt, and
  mTOR protein expression in lung tissue was determined using Western blot analysis.
  (b) Western blot density analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). ⁎⁎P < 0.01
  versus the control group. ##P < 0.01 and #P < 0.05 versus the model group. &&P < 0.01
  versus the AMI 200-mg/kg group.'
