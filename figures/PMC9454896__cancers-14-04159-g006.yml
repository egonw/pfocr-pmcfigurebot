caption: The sphere-forming T24T cells with high expression of SNHG1 and Rac1 and
  low expression of miR-129-5p were markedly more invasive than the non-sphere-forming
  T24T cells. (A,B) The isolated sphered T24T cells were subjected to transwell migration
  and invasion assays, and the results are presented relative to their parental T24T
  cells. (C–E) The parental T24T and sphered T24T cells were collected, and the proteins
  were extracted and subjected to either Western blotting to assess the expression
  of Rac1 (C) or real-time PCR to determine the expression of SNHG1 (D) and miR-129-5p
  levels (E). The results are presented as means  ±  SD from triplicate experiments,
  and asterisks (*) indicate a significant difference (p  <  0.01). (F) A schematic
  model of the SNHG1/DNMT3A/miR-129-5p/Rac1 signaling pathway in regulating the stem-cell-like
  and invasive properties of advanced bladder cancer cells. Bars in (A) are equal
  to 100 μm.
