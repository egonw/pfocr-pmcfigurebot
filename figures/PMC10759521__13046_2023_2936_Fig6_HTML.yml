caption: 'DCAF13 inhibits p53 protein stability via ubiquitination modification. (A)
  A549 cells were transfected with siDCAF13#1, #2, #3 for 48 h. Before harvest, cells
  were treated with MG132 (5 μM) for 6 h, cell lysates were subjected to western blotting
  with indicated antibodies. (B) A549 cells were transfected with siDCAF13#1 for 48 h.,
  Before harvest, cells were treated with 10 mg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated
  time points, and then the cell lysates were used for western blotting. (C) The ubiquitinase
  and substrate website predicts that p53 is the most potentially substrate specifically
  recognized by DCAF13 using UbiBrowser database. (D) Immunofluorescence assay was
  performed to observe the cellular localization of DCAF13 and p53 in A549 and SPC-A1
  cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) A549 or SPC-A1 whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with protein-A/G agarose beads (mock IgG) or anti-p53 antibody and western blotted
  with indicated antibodies. Levels of endogenous p53, DCAF13, CUL4A, DDB1 and RBX1
  were determined by western blot analysis of cell extracts (input) with indicated
  antibodies. F-H. A549 or SPC-A1 cells were co-transfected with the indicated siRNA
  and plasmids for 48 h. Before harvest, cells were treated with MG132 (5 μM) for
  6 h. Subsequently, cell lysates were subjected to IP assays with p53 antibody for
  12 h and then with protein G beads for 4 h. The mixtures including were ubiquitinated
  p53 were analyzed by western blot analysis with indicated antibodies. Polyubiquitination
  level of p53 was detected with the anti-His antibody. I. A549 or SPC-A1 cells were
  co-transfected with the indicated siRNA and plasmids, including K0 (lysineless),
  K48 (only K48-linked Ub), and K63 (only K63-linked Ub) as indicated, the following
  procedure is as shown in Fig. 6F-H'
