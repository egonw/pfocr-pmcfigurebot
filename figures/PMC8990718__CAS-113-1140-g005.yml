caption: 'Serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) induced neutrophils to produce immunosuppressive
  cytokines and apoptosis resistance. (A) Representative bands and relative expression
  levels of Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2), myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (MYD88), p‐p65/nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB), PI3K, and p‐AKT in neutrophils treated
  with SAA1 and anti‐TLR2, PI3K inhibitor, or NF‐κB inhibitor (n = 3) **p < 0.01 vs.
  untreated neutrophils; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. SAA1‐treated neutrophils. (B) Release
  of interleukin‐10 (IL‐10), arginase (Arg), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  by neutrophils isolated from breast cancer patients treated with various combinations
  of SAA1, PI3K inhibitor, and NF‐κB inhibitor (n = 3). **p < 0.01 vs. untreated neutrophils;
  ##p < 0.01 vs. SAA1‐treated neutrophils. (C) Apoptosis of neutrophils treated with
  SAA1, anti‐TLR2, and p38 inhibitor (n = 3) *p < 0.05 vs. untreated neutrophils;
  #p < 0.05 vs. SAA1‐treated neutrophils. (D) Representative bands and relative expression
  levels of TLR2, MYD88, p‐p38, Bcl‐2, and cleaved caspase‐3 in neutrophils treated
  with SAA1, anti‐TLR2, and p38 inhibitor (n = 3). **p < 0.01 vs. untreated neutrophils;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. SAA1‐treated neutrophils. (E) Release of IL‐10, Arg, and
  iNOS by neutrophils isolated from breast cancer patients treated with SAA1 and p38
  inhibitor. Data are expressed as mean ± SD'
