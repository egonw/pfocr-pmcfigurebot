caption: Intracellular signaling pathways that KIT is involved in. The KIT receptor
  tyrosine kinase can facilitate multiple signaling pathways when bound to a stem
  cell factor ligand. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway guides cell proliferation. The PI3K-Akt
  pathway helps determine cell survival and proliferation. The JAK-STAT pathway plays
  a role in cell proliferation and differentiation/development (Created with BioRender.com
