caption: (A) Chemical structure of piperine. (B) Experimental design. Rats were administered
  piperine (10 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before KA injection (15 mg/kg, i.p.). Seizure
  behaviour and epileptic bursts were recorded 3 h after KA administration. At 3 days
  after KA injection, the rats were examined by the Morris water maze (MWM) test and
  sacrificed for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Western blot, and
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies.
