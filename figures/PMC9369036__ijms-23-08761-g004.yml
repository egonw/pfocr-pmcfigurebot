caption: Inhibition of glutamine transporter ASCT2 suppresses mTORC1/S6K activity
  and resensitizes SKOV3-TR cells to paclitaxel. (A,B) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured
  in medium treated with 100 nM of paclitaxel and 20 μM of V-9302 for 48 h. (A) The
  expression of mTOR, S6K and S6 proteins and their phosphorylation were measured
  by immunoblotting. (B) The cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. (C,D) SKOV3-TR
  cells were transiently transfected with control and ASCT2 siRNA for 6 h and were
  subsequently treated with 100 nM of paclitaxel for 48 h. (C) The expression of mTOR,
  S6K, and S6 proteins and their phosphorylation were measured by immunoblotting (D).
  The cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. Protein expression was quantified
  as fold changes with respect to the control after normalization of respective β-actin
  levels using ImageJ software. The data are presented as the mean percentage of control
  ±SD relative to the control (n = 3, ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ns, not significantly
  different). PTX, paclitaxel.
