caption: hsa-miR-340-3p is negatively correlated with the expression of HTR1D in pancreatic
  cancer, and promotes the apoptosis of PCs in vitro. a The venn diagram for the intersection
  of the upstream regulatory miRNAs of HTR1D predicted by different databases and
  the differentially expressed miRNAs of liver cancer samples in TCGA database. b-c
  The expression difference and survival analysis curve of hsa-miR-340-3p using RStudio
  based on the bioinformatics analysis of TCGA data. d Correlation analysis of the
  expression of HTR1D and hsa-miR-340-3p in TCGA pancreatic cancer samples. e The
  mRNA expression level of hsa-miR-340-3p was detected by qPCR in PANC-1 and CFPAC-1.
  f The dual luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to verify the interaction
  between HTR1D and hsa-miR-340-3p. g-h The effect of overexpressing hsa-miR-340-3p
  on the expression level of HTR1D in each cell line by qPCR. i-j Western blot was
  performed to detect apoptosis-related proteins and phosphorylated AKT in each cell
  line transfected with designated plasmids. Each experiment was performed three times
  independently and results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was used
  to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)
article_title: HTR1D functions as a key target of HOXA10-AS/miR-340-3p axis to promote
  the malignant outcome of pancreatic cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
