caption: Assays for toxicity of U. virens culture filtrates with rice seeds. (A) Seeds
  of rice cultivar Liangyoupeijiu were incubated on sterile filter papers soaked with
  filtrates of 5-day-old PSB cultures of the wild-type strain Jt209, ΔUvste50 mutant,
  and the complemented strain Uvste50-c. Shoot and root growth were examined after
  incubation at 25 °C for 5 days. (B) The statistical analysis of the shoot and root
  length in (A). Data were represented as means ± SD from three independent experiments.
  * represent significant differences compared with wild-type Jt209 as estimated by
  Duncan’s new multiple range test (p < 0.05).
