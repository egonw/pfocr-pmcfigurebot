caption: Transcriptional response of mouse lungs after infection with wild-type and
  accessory deletion viruses. (A) Overview heatmap showing all genes differentially
  expressed in at least one condition from murine lungs infected with accessory deletion
  viruses, relative to WA-1 at day 2 (Left) or 4 (Right). Blue indicates higher expression
  relative to WA-1; red indicates reduced relative expression. A table with all gene
  names and fold changes is included in SI Appendix, Table S8A; this table includes
  values for all other heatmaps in this figure. (B) Venn diagrams showing the number
  of genes for each variant and combinations that are significantly different from
  WA-1 at day 2 (Top) and day 4 (Bottom). Up-regulated genes are shown in the blue-shaded
  diagrams (Left) and down-regulated in red (Right). (C) Fold changes of murine ISGs
  in accessory deletion viruses relative to WA-1. A table with all gene names and
  fold changes is included in SI Appendix, Table S8B. Conditions with a significant
  change in mean ISG expression compared to wild-type infection (mean fold change
  not equal to 0) are indicated by an asterisk (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by
  one-way T-test with Bonferroni correction). Error bars are standard deviation. (D)
  Heatmap showing IL-17–regulated gene expression relative to WA-1. Genes that met
  our significance threshold (at least twofold change in expression, adjusted P value
  < 0.05) in a particular condition are outlined in black. (E) Expression of genes
  in the wound healing signaling pathway in knockout infections relative to WA-1.
  Genes that met our significance threshold (at least twofold change in expression,
  adjusted P value < 0.05) in a particular condition are outlined in black.
