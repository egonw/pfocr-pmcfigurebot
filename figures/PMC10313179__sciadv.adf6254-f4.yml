figure_title: Bulk RNA-seq analysis to identify genes affected by fru knockdown in
  oenocytes
caption: '(A) PCA plot shows that the biological replicates of each genotype are highly
  consistent. The datasets from fru knockdown induced by three independent RNAi lines
  show good clustering. (B) Heatmap of expression of differentially expressed genes
  identified from bulk RNA-seq. Gene expression is shown in normalized log2 counts
  per million. Differentially expressed genes were selected on the basis of the threshold
  of P ≤ 0.001 and ≥4-fold change. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes.
  The y axis indicates the pathway name, and the x axis indicates the fold change.
  (D) Gene set enrichment analysis for interpreting gene expression data of four metabolic
  pathways. (E) Down-regulation of VLCFA/hydrocarbon biosynthesis genes in oenocytes
  with fru knockdown from two independent replicates. Colors in the heatmap correspond
  to the scaled FPKM which is shown as a number in each cell. (F) The FA synthesis
  & elongation pathway from KEGG, with green boxes indicating genes down-regulated
  in this subset, and RT-qPCR analysis of genes in the VLCFA/hydrocarbon metabolic
  pathway (controls: blue bars; oeno > fruIR: salmon bars) (G). Transcript levels
  are normalized to Rp49 mRNA and presented relative to the level of controls. Asterisks
  illustrate statistically significant differences between conditions. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.'
