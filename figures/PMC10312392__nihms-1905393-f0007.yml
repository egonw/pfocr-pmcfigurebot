figure_title: AR-activated pathway promoting glucose-stimulated actin remodeling and
  exocytosis
caption: '(A) Human islets (n = 3 donors, 10 IEQ/condition) were treated with DHT
  for 5 min, 30 min, and 18 h, compared with control untreated islets, and studied
  by RPPA. Normalized values from the three individual donors were averaged to generate
  an average Z score and map phosphoproteins in the heatmap. *p < 0.05 (t test). (B–H)
  GSIS was measured in static incubation in male human islets (10 IEQ/condition measured
  in triplicate) cultured for 24 h with vehicle or DHT (10 nM) followed by 40 min
  with DHT in the presence or absence of the following inhibitors: (B) dual FAK and
  PYK2 inhibitors PF431396 (15 nM) and PF562271 (15 nM) (n = 3–5 donors), (C) selective
  FAK inhibitor PF573228 (10 nM) (n = 3–7 donors), (D) selective PYK2 inhibitor PF4618433
  (1 μM) (n = 3–7 donors), (E) SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 (1 μM) (n = 3–5 donors), (F)
  PI3K inhibitors BKM120 (1 μM) and GDC-0941 (1 μM) (n = 3–4 donors), and (H) mTORC2
  inhibitor JR-AB2–011 (5 μM) (n = 5 donors). (G) GSIS was measured in static incubation
  in islets treated with vehicle or DHT (10 nM) for 40 min from male control (RIP-Cre),
  βRAHET, and βRAKO mice (n = 7 mice, with each condition measured in triplicate,
  n = 10 islets per replicate),.(I) Representative transmission electron micrographs
  of human islet β cell treated with vehicle (left) and DHT (right). Insets highlight
  insulin granules, where red arrows show multigranules. Scale bar, 1 μm.(J) (Top)
  Quantification of insulin granule size. (Bottom) Quantification of percentage of
  insulin multigranules over total insulin granules/cell across n = 3 donors (I and
  J) and 15 cells.(K) Plasma membrane content of VAMP2 normalized for STX4 in INS-1
  832/3 cells treated with DHT (10 nM).(L and M) Insulin exocytosis measured by change
  in capacitance (fF) from human islet β cells with DHT (10 nM) applied via patch
  pipette in the presence of cAMP (100 μM) (n = 22 cells per treatment). Changes in
  fF are normalized to cell size (pF).(N and O) Calcium current measured in human
  islet b cells with DHT (10 nM) applied via patch pipette in the presence of cAMP
  (100 μM) (n = 22 cells per treatment). Calcium current (ICa), calcium influx (QCa),
  and calcium influx (pC) are normalized to cell size (pF).(P) Schematic representation
  of proposed mechanism. (1 and 2) DHT-activated AR pools in the PM vicinity, mitochondria
  (mito), and nucleus program glycolysis and TCA cycle, increasing CO2 production,
  which is converted to HCO3− via carbonic anhydrase (CA). HCO3− activates the sAC
  at (3) the PM and (4) endo while CFTR and NBC promote HCO3− efflux to maintain pH
  homeostasis. In parallel, DHT-activated AR pools at the (3) PM and (4) endo collaborate
  with ligand-activated GLP-1R to promote Gαs recruitment to AR and GLP-1R complexes
  and activate tmAC. Together, this results in DHT enhancing GLP-1-mediated cAMP production
  at the PM and endo, which (5) activates cAMP-dependent effectors PKA and EPAC2 to
  promote insulin granule exocytosis. (6) DHT-activated AR in the PM vicinity activates
  a signaling cascade including FAK/SRC/PI3K/mTORC2 that further enhances insulin
  granule exocytosis. AR-DHT may also promote actin remodeling via gelsolin (GSN).Values
