caption: 'A Experimental study design. Eight to 12-week-old Pax7creER/+; Rosa26 tdTomato/+
  mice were administrated with tamoxifen for five consecutive days followed by 5-day
  waiting period to label MuSCs with tdTomato. Quiescent and freshly isolated MuSCs
  were collected immediately after 5-day waiting period. MuSCs from CTX injury-, freeze
  injury- and overload-mouse models were harvested 3-, 4- and 7-day after surgery,
  respectively. Quiescent MuSCs as well as MuSCs from CTX injury-, freeze injury-
  and overload-mouse model representing cells in vivo state were fixed by PFA perfusion
  before isolation process. Freshly isolated MuSCs were collected without fixation.
  RNA-seq library of MuSCs sorted by FACS were constructed by Smart-RNAseq. CTX, cardiotoxin;
  PFA, paraformaldehyde; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting. B, C Representative
  pictures showing EdU and PAX7 staining in the sham model and different injury models.
  Arrows represent EdU+/PAX7+ cells; arrowheads represent EdU-/PAX7+ cells. C Quantification
  of EdU-positive MuSCs. n = 3 mice/treatment, >450 Pax7+ cells counted/mouse. D Principal
  component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression in quiescent MuSCs, CTX-injury MuSCs,
  freeze-injury MuSCs, overloaded MuSCs and FISCs. FISCs, freshly isolated satellite
  cells. n = 2 biological replicate RNA-seq data/group. E–G Expression heatmap of
  (E) quiescence-, (F) Notch signaling pathway- and (G) stress-associated genes induced
  by the isolation process. n = 2 biological replicate RNA-seq data/group. H Venn
  diagram of differentially downregulated genes in different activated MuSCs compared
  to quiescent cells. The red dashed area represents quiescence-maintaining genes.
