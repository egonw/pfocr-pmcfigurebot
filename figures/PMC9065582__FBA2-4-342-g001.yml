caption: RhoA‐ROCK activity determines motility response to flow. (A) Focal adhesion
  was identified as a top KEGG pathway differentially regulated between positive and
  negative breast cancer subsets. Fold change in pathway signaling effectors is depicted
  for positive versus negative breast cancer contrast in the left half of split nodes
  and for prostate on the right of the node. Color scale legends indicate fold change
  after 6 h of wall shear stress (WSS). (B) Flow significantly elevated GTP‐bound
  (active) RhoA levels 60 min after initiation of WSS in MDA‐MB‐231 (unpaired t‐test,
  *p < 0.05). RhoA GTPase activity was unchanged in MCF‐7. Error bars represent SEM.
  (C) Rac1 activity was not significantly changed in either MDA‐MB‐231 or MCF‐7. (D)
  Cdc42 activity was unchanged in response to flow in both cell lines. (E, F) WSS‐induced
  motility in MDA‐MB‐231 is suppressed by ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 µm) and disruption
  of RhoA activity by dominant negative or constitutively active forms of RhoA (two‐way
  ANOVA, *p < 0.05). Error bars represent SD
