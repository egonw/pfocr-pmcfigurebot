caption: HBV transcripts and inflammation. (A) Heatmap and Venn diagram depicting
  the q-value and inflammatory gene transcripts that positively associate with pC/pg,
  RR, or preS1/S2 RNAs from CHB biopsies and their overlap. Probabilities were estimated
  using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient with p-values corrected for a 5% false
  discovery rate (FDR) using the two stage Benjamini–Krieger–Yekutieli method. (B)
  Principal component analysis of the 24 genes associated with pC/pg RNA and RR identified
  in (A) stratifies patients according to their EASL disease staging (ENCI- grey and
  ENCH- blue). Average expression of the 24 gene signature in biopsies from patients
  diagnosed as ENCI or ENCH (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, **** p < 0.0001). (C) Pathway
  analysis of enriched GO biological processes were determined using PantherDB and
  redundancy accounted for using REVIGO. 21 pathways were identified where at least
  half of our gene set was represented. (D) Cell-type-specific expression of the 24
  inflammatory genes in the human liver single cell atlas [], where data is presented
  as the mean of the log2-transformed values.
