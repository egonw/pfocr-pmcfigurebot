caption: Biosynthesis pathway of cannabinoids. Hexanoyl-CoA and butyl-CoA are used
  as substrates to generate olivetolic and divarinic acid. Through the action of cannabigerolic
  acid synthase (CBGAS), olivetolic and divarinic acids are converted into cannabigerolic
  acid (CBGA) and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA), the central precursor for cannabichromenic
  acid (CBCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic
  acid (Δ9-THCA), and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarinic acid (Δ9-THCVA). After exposure
  to heat (ΔT), CBGA, CBCA, CBDA, CBDVA, Δ9-THCA, and Δ9-THCVA decarboxylate (-CO2)
  are converted into cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD),
  cannabidivarin (CBDV), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), and Δ9-tertrahydrocannabivarin
  (Δ9-THCV), respectively. Cannabinoids Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) and cannabinol
  (CBN) are formed by isomerization and oxidation, respectively, of Δ9-THC.
