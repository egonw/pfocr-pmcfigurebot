caption: a Temporal evolution of average protein activities over 1000 model simulations
  in response to repeated stimulation on all the receptors. b The overall activity
  of proteins on a fixed time scale (from 0 to 15,000). Points represent the average
  over 1000 simulations, and error bars are the coefficient of variation
article_title: Mathematical model of the cell signaling pathway based on the extended
  Boolean network model with a stochastic process.
