caption: Changes after Ins and Rn addition to astrocytes in primary culture. Rn facilitates
  the effects of insulin, increasing cell viability and proliferation, along with
  the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as PPAR-γ, and inhibiting that
  of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2. Furthermore, Rn potentiated the effect
  of insulin on the expression of an antioxidant enzyme (Mn-SOD), the components of
  the AKT-eNOS pathway, and the ERK signaling pathway.
