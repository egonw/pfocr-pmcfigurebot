figure_title: SEMA4B-211aa interacts with p85 and regulates PI3K activity
caption: a Expression of key proteins in PI3K pathway were detected in BC cells transfected
  with Flag-circSEMA4B, Flag-circSEMA4B-MUT, Flag-circSEMA4B-NC, and Flag-circSEMA4B-211aa.
  b Mutual interaction of p85 and SEMA4B-211aa were determined by Co-IP. c p85/p110
  complex was influenced by SEMA4B-211aa by Co-IP. d Colocalization of p85 and SEMA4B-211aa
  in BC cells. Red, SEMA4B-211aa; green, p85; blue, DAPI. e, f PI3K activity was determined
  by ELISA according to PIP2/PIP3 expression in BC cells transfected with Flag-circSEMA4B,
  Flag-circSEMA4B-MUT, Flag-circSEMA4B-NC, and Flag-circSEMA4B-211aa.
article_title: CircSEMA4B inhibits the progression of breast cancer by encoding a
  novel protein SEMA4B-211aa and regulating AKT phosphorylation.
