caption: Blocking BR downregulates ERK and MMP-1/-9 expression. Mice (n = 10) were
  intranasally infected with M. bovis (at a dose of 200 CFU/mice) or with PBS. Mice
  were sacrificed after 5 and 9 weeks of infection, and lung tissues were collected.
  (a) B1R and (b) B2R expression was determined by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR).
  RAW264.7 cells were transfected with siRKLK12 and negative control siRNA (20uM).
  After 48 h of transfection, the cells were infected with M. bovis. After 24 h, samples
  were collected. Then, (c) B1R and (d) B2R expression was determined by Western Blot
  analysis. To validate our hypothesis, RAW264.7 cells were processed to block bradykinin
  receptors and infected with M. bovis. After 24 h, samples were collected. (e) ERK-1/-2
  and (f,g) MMP-1/-9 expression was determined by Western Blot analysis. (h) The regulation
  of MMP-1/-9 expression by M. bovis through the BR/ERK signaling pathway is represented
  schematically. Data represent the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments (**
  p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
