caption: 'MAGI2-AS3 delayed cell senescence mediated by the ROS/MAP2K6/p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway. (A) RNA-seq results of differential gene expression in Fbs expressing NC-shRNA
  or MAGI2-AS3 sh-1. (B) GO analysis of differentially expressed genes (*p:< 0.05)
  in Fbs expressing NC-shRNA or MAGI2-AS3 sh-1. RT-qPCR analysis of 8 aging related
  genes (MAP2K6, DLL3, IL1B, PECAM1, ELN, VWA5A, MMP12, FLT1) expression in Fbs expressing
  NC-shRNA or MAGI2-AS3 sh-1. The data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *: p < 0.05,
  **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001 by unpaired t-test. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of MAP2K6
  mRNA expression in Fbs expressing NC-shRNA, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1 or MAGI2-AS3 sh-2. The
  data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01 by unpaired
  t-test. (D) Western blot analysis of the level of phosphorylated p38 protein in
  young and aged cells. The data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *: p < 0.05
  by unpaired t-test. (E) Western blot analysis of the p38 protein level and level
  of phosphorylated p38 protein in Fbs control and transduced with lentiviral vectors
  expressing NC-shRNA, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1. The data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3).
  *: p < 0.05 by unpaired t-test. (F) Western blot analysis of the p38, phosphorylated
  p38 and HSPA8 proteins level in Fbs transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing
  NC-shRNA, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1 and HSPA8-shRNA. The data are shown as
  the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *: p < 0.05, #: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ##: p < 0.01 by
  unpaired t-test. (G) The relative telomere length (T/S: ratio of the relative telomere
  length to single gene copy) in Fbs expressing NC-shRNA, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1 with or without
  MAP2K6 overexpression was determined by RT-qPCR. The data are shown as the mean ± SEM
  (n = 3). *: p < 0.05, ##: p < 0.05 by unpaired t-test. (H) SA-β-Gal staining in
  Fbs transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing NC-shRNA, MAGI2-AS3 sh-1 with
  or without MAP2K6 overexpression. The data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3).
  The data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). **: p < 0.01, ##: p < 0.01 by unpaired
  t-test. (I) Schematic diagram of downregulation of long non-coding RNA MAGI2-AS3
  attenuates H2O2 level and delays cell senescence by reducing degradation of HSPA8.'
