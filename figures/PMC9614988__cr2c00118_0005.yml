caption: 'UDP-α-d-GlcNAc biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthesis of UDP-α-d-GlcNAc
  occurs by different routes, with that from bacteria requiring fewer enzymatic steps.
  Both pathways start from Fru-6P. Members of the five clades of the Mimivirus genus
  encode all the enzymes in the eukaryotic biosynthetic pattern, except for the GlcNAc-6P
  to GlcNAc-1P phosphomutase, which is likely encoded by an unknown viral enzyme or
  by the host (ND: not defined). APMV (prototype of A clade) is the only virus for
  which the activity of each enzyme (annotated in bold) has been experimentally validated:
  L619, L316, and R689. L619 and L316 are close to their eukaryotic counterpart, while
  R689 appears to be of prokaryotic origin. The activities of the enzymes are indicated
  in parentheses. As for the representatives of the other clades, the genes involved
  in this pathway have been assigned by in silico analysis, and they are listed in
  the following order: clade B, Moumouvirus australiensis (Ma) and Moumouvirus maliensis
  (Mm); clade C, Megavirus chilensis (Mg); clade D, Tupanvirus deep ocean (L or R
  depending on the coding sense of the gene); clade E, Cotonvirus japonicus (ORF).'
