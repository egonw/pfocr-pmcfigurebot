caption: TAZ rescued microglia from apoptosis via Nrf2(A and B) TAZ prevented microglia
  apoptosis via Nrf2. After introduction of the TAZ overexpression plasmid, cell apoptosis
  was evaluated in the absence or presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 by flow cytometry
  analysis or staining with Hoechst 33342, followed by visualization under a fluorescence
  microscope. N = 4. (C and D) TAZ attenuated Casp3 activity and reduced the levels
  of Casp3 and Bax mRNA along with recovery of Bcl2 expression through Nrf2. N = 5.
article_title: TAZ ameliorates the microglia-mediated inflammatory response via the
  Nrf2-ROS-NF-κB pathway.
