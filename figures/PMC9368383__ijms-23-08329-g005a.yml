caption: 'Effect of SANG on the expression of IKBKE, NF-κB, and ERK1/2 in TNF-α-stimulated
  TNBC cells. The expression of different proteins was measured in four samples for
  each experiment, corresponding to the resting, SANG-treated (2.0 µM in MDA-MB-231
  cells and 1.5 µM in MDA-MB-468 cells), 50 ng/mL TNF-α-stimulated, and co-treated
  cells (TNF-α + SANG). The automated, simple Western system with its Compass software
  was used for band immunodetection for MDA-MB-231 (A) and MDA-MB-468 (B) cells. Quantitative
  analysis of GAPDH-normalized data for MDA-MB-231 (C) and MDA-MB-468 (D) cells. The
  data generated from two independent experiments (n = 4) are presented as the mean
  ± SEM. The significance of the difference between TNF α-treated cells vs. control
  cells (*) or between TNF-α-stimulated vs. co-treated cells (#) groups was analyzed
  using an unpaired t-test. */# p < 0.05, **/## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, and ****/####
  p < 0.0001 are considered significant difference; NS, not significant.'
