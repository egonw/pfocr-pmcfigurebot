caption: α-phellandrene promotes cell proliferation via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) signaling pathway. Cells were incubated with either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide;
  DMSO) or 12.5 μM of α-phellandrene for 48 h. The cells were preincubated with the
  vehicle, 50 μM of SQ22,536, 10 μM of H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), or 100 nM
  of 666-15 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein inhibitor) for 1 h before α-phellandrene
  treatment. (A–C) Cell proliferation was measured using water-soluble tetrazolium
  salt (WST-1) analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
  (SEM) of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences are
  marked as ns, not significant (p > 0.05); * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
