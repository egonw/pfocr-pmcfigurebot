caption: Possible mechanisms of action involved in the antidepressant-like effect
  of chrysin. (A) The flavonoid chrysin can modulate ERα and ERβ of membrane, which
  triggers the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway involved in phosphorylation and subsequent
  CREB activation (CREB), which promotes the increase of BDNF levels (BDNF) [,,,],
  which can further activate the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling by the TrkB interaction [].
  The above-mentioned pathway also promotes an increase of TpOH expression (TpOH)
  and serotonin levels (Serotonin) resulting in the antidepressant-like effect [,].
  (B) Furthermore, chrysin can decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α,
  IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ), which inhibits IDO activity (IDO) improving serotonergic neurotransmission
  and producing its antidepressant-like effect []. ER = estrogen receptor; MAPK =
  mitogen-activated-protein-kinases; CREB = cAMP response element binding; BDNF =
  brain derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB = tropomyosinreceptor kinase B; TpOH = tryptophan-hydroxylase;
  TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β = interleukin 1 beta; IL-6 = interleukin
  6; IFN-γ = interferon gamma; IDO = indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; ERK1/2 = extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2; KYN = kynurenine. (Figure was prepared by the authors).
