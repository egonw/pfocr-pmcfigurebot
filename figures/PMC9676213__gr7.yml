caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of complement and coagulation responses on the alginate
  microspheres based on proteomic and CLSM analyses as well as functional data from
  human whole blood (hWB). The complement and coagulation systems are interconnected
  protein defence systems [], consisting of sequential activation of zymogens to active
  proteinases during inflammatory responses. The complement system is activated by
  three distinct pathways: classical, lectin and alternative, which have been thoroughly
  described elsewhere [,]. HiG and SA are significantly enriched with proteins of
  both the classical (e.g. C1q and APCS) and lectin pathways (MBL/collectins/ficolins),
  which may suggest an initial complement activation. However, low levels of C3 indicate
  a prompt attenuation of this potential complement response through initial regulators.
  SA is unique in the high abundance of adsorbed complement inhibitors (C1IN, CFH,
  CFI, C4BP, CPN, CLU, VTN). HiG is enriched with fewer inhibitors (C1IN, CFH, CFI,
  CLU) and to a lesser extent. HiG, and especially SA, exhibit low terminal complement
  activity (fluid-phase TCC; sTCC) in hWB, despite being enriched with proteins involved
  in TCC formation, which suggest inactivation of TCC or adsorption of non-assembled
  TCC-components. AP displays pronounced enrichment of CFP and C3, indicating complement
  initiation and propagation through the alternative pathway. Moreover, enrichment
  of prothrombin/thrombin (FII [a]) and plasminogen/plasmin (PLG) also present the
  additional possibility of a complement-independent activation of C3 and C5. AP is
  distinct in the absence or low levels of initial complement inhibitors. This is
  in accordance with a persisting complement response and subsequent terminal complement
  activity, shown for these microspheres by the high levels of adsorbed proteins involved
  in TCC formation and the significant TCC response in hWB. The coagulation system
  is activated through two mechanisms: the extrinsic (tissue factor) pathway (not
  discussed here) and the intrinsic (contact activation) pathway, which has been described
  elsewhere [,, , ]. All the microspheres activate coagulation to some extent, as
  seen by the functional hWB data. SA has an overall moderate coagulation reactivity
  but the highest coagulation (prothrombin fragment 1 ​+ ​2) response among the microspheres.
  Being highly enriched with proteins of the intrinsic pathway, such as FXII, suggests
  coagulation activation through the contact system. SA is also enriched with numerous
  coagulation inhibitors (AT3, HCF2, C1IN, PROC, ZPI), which likely diminishes this
  activation. HiG shares a similar coagulation profile to SA in types of enriched
  proteins, although at significantly lower abundances and with some variation in
  adsorbed inhibitors (i.e. PROC, TFPI). Distinctively, AP is enriched with all the
  contact system proteins, except for C1IN, which potentially allows for pro-inflammatory
  signalling by BK. Further enrichments include several coagulation inhibitors (AT3,
  HCF2, PROC, ZPI, TFPI). AP shows the highest enrichment of FII(a) yet distinctively
  lacks central proteins (FX, FV) of the intrinsic pathway. Hence, the observed coagulation
  reactivity in hWB indicates tissue factor-dependent initiation [], closely linked
  to complement activation.'
