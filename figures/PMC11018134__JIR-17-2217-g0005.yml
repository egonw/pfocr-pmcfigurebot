caption: 'Transcriptomic and bioinformatics analysis of cell samples from the control
  and FBL groups. (A) Correlation analysis of FBL expression in the control and FBL
  groups (the darker the color is, the stronger the correlation). (B) Volcano plots
  of gene expression (control and FBL group samples). Red dots: significantly upregulated
  genes; blue dots: significantly downregulated genes; gray dots: genes whose expression
  did not significantly change. (C) Venn diagram of the differentially expressed genes.
  (D) Ten upregulated genes were selected for visualization via heatmaps.'
