caption: The expression patterns of the key genes in the gossypol synthesis pathway.
  Data were obtained using the log2FPKM of each gene. From top to bottom in the figure
  are HMGR, IPPI, FPS, CAD, CYP706B1, CYP82D113, and CYP71BE79. Gl, Ll, Go, and Lo
  represent the leaves of the glanded cotton, leaves of glandless cotton, ovules of
  glanded cotton, and ovules of glandless cotton, respectively. Dashed arrows indicate
  unidentified reaction(s). (Pathway from []).
