caption: 'CK supplementation presents inhibiting effects on TLR4 signaling pathway
  in db/db mice. (A) Expression level of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in renal tissue was detected
  by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar, 20 μm. Relative expression examined by immunohistochemistry
  was analyzed and shown in histogram. (B) The levels of TLR4, TLR2 and phosphorylated
  and total MAPK p38, JNK and IκB-α proteins. (C) The levels of phosphorylated and
  total NF-κB p65 and levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β proteins.
  (D) The levels of phosphorylated and total Stat3 and levels of MyD88, TGF-β1, ICAM-1,
  and PAI-1 proteins. Data were expressed as means ± SEM (n = 7). ###p < 0.001, ##p
  < 0.01, #p < 0.05 compared to normal. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 compared
  to model.'
