caption: 'Illustration of EC signaling due to TME angiogenic activity and hypoxia-induced
  VEGF production in tumor cells: Hypoxia prevents HIF-1α from degradation in the
  proteasome and HIF-1α in the nucleus links with HIF-1β and CBP/P300 and upregulates
  VEGF gene transcription. Briefly, the most important pathways in EC lead to cell
  proliferation, survival, and migration that results in angiogenesis under the effect
  of soluble mediators secreted by TME cells. Proliferation: Ras/Raf/ERK related to
  VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling, and PI3K/AKT/MAPK related to EphB4/ephrinB2 forward signaling.
  Survival: TSAd/Akt/mTOR in VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling events, and AKT/PDK-1/Akt/mTOR
  in ANG-2/Tie-2 signaling events. Migration: NCK/ FYN/p38MAPK results from VEGF/VEGFR2
  interaction, PI3K/AKT/FAK results from EphB4/ephrinB2 forward signaling, and PAK/FAK
  results from EphB4/ephrinB2 reverse signaling pathway'
