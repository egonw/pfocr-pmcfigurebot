caption: Effect of cBMDM-sEVs on proliferation and inflammation of synovium in vivo
  and in vitro by targeting mTOR and downstream signal pathway. (A) Venn diagram of
  the targeting genes of miR-100-5p predicted by TargetScan, miRDB, and microT. (B)
  mRNA expression of mTOR in RA-FLS cocultured with PBS, cBMDM-sEVs or nBMDM-sEVs,
  respectively. (C) mRNA expression of mTOR in RA-FLS cocultured with different concentrations
  of cBMDM-sEVs. (D) Representative fluorescence images of mTOR in RA-FLS cocultured
  with PBS, cBMDM-sEVs or nBMDM-sEVs. (E) mTOR expression in knee and ankle joints
  analyzed by IHC. (F-G) Protein expression of mTOR, p-mTOR, p70s6K, p-p70s6K, 4E-BP1,
  and p-4E-BP1 by WB. Data are presented as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001
