caption: Platelets and B lymphocytes utilize common signaling pathways. BTK is differentially
  involved in the downstream signaling pathways triggered by ligand engagement of
  the major platelet adhesion/signaling receptors (αIIbβ3, GPVI, and GPIbα of the
  GPIb-IX-V complex) and the BCR. In receptors with ITAMs, following ligand binding
  and receptor clustering, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic ITAMs and recruitment
  of SFKs ensue, resulting in phosphorylation of Syk and activation of PI3K. PI3K
  mediates the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-triphosphate, which engages BTK, resulting in phosphorylation of PLCγ. In
  platelets, this leads to activation and aggregation. In B cells, activation of MAPKs,
  NF-κB, and NFAT leads to B cell proliferation, development, and survival. BCR and
  GPVI ITAM signaling are more reliant on the BTK pathway compared with GPIbα and
  αIIbβ3, thus signaling downstream of these receptors is more sensitive to BTK inhibition.
