caption: YTHDF3 regulates B. mori diapause. (A) Silkworm egg development is delayed
  after YTHDF3 knockdown; (B) Overexpression of YTHDF3 induces diapause; (C) After
  overexpressing YTHDF3 and egfp, total RNA was subjected to m6A RIP followed by RT-qPCR.
  Values are mean ± s.d. of n = 4 independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  two tailed Student’s t-test.
