caption: Hyperosmolarity decreased AQP-3 expression and inhibited activation of ERK1/2
  signaling in NP cells. (a) Immunocytochemical detection of AQP-3 expression of NP
  cells under different osmotic pressures (330 mOsm/kg and 550 mOsm/kg). (b, c) Real-time
  PCR and western blotting analysis of AQP3 expression under different osmolarity
  (330 mOsm/kg and 550 mOsm/kg), respectively. (d) Western blotting analysis of ERK1/2
  activation under different osmotic pressures (330 mOsm/kg and 550 mOsm/kg). Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD. (A) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05) when
  compared with 330 mOsm/kg.
