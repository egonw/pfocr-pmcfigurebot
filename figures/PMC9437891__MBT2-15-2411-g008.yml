caption: (A) Schematic representation of the insertion of the reporter construct into
  a genomic locus in B. subtilis 168. The pSG1151 plasmid containing homologous proH
  sequence fused with sfGFP (Sp) was integrated into the chromosome in a Campbell‐like
  manner, upstream the native proHJ operon. (B) B. subtilis 168 response to mild osmostress
  (0.6 M NaCl) in SMM media. Enzymatic reactions related to osmotically induced proline
  biosynthesis are coloured in green, whereas the non‐stress related, anabolic pathway
  is marked with blue. Asterisk indicates products of proHJ translation followed in
  this study.

  subtilis: a population‐wide and single‐cell study of the osmotically controlled
