caption: CKB affected U2-OS cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis through the
  p53 signaling pathway. A. Western blotting was performed to measure the levels of
  p53 protein in U2-OS cells; B. U2-OS cell proliferation was assessed using colony
  formation assay; C. U2-OS cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry; D. A
  Transwell experiment was performed to assess U2-OS cell invasion. **P < 0.01.
