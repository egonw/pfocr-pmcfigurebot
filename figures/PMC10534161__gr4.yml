caption: KEGG pathway enrichment of differential metabolites in the longissimus lumborum
  of Tibetan sheep(a). In the bubble diagram, each bubble represents a metabolic pathway.
  The larger the bubble is, the greater the impact factor is; the darker the bubble
  is, the more significant the degree of enrichment is. A differential abundance score
  map of differential metabolic pathways(b). The differential abundance score captures
  the average, gross changes for all metabolites in a pathway. A score of 1 indicates
  an upward trend in all identified metabolites in this pathway, and − 1 indicated
  that the expression trend of all identified metabolites in this pathway was down-regulated
  in the WG group.
