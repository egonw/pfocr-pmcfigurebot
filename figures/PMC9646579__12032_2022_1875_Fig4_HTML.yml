caption: The coexpression gene of MND1 predicts that MND1 may be related to cell cycle.
  A Heatmap showing the top 50 genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) that were
  positively and negatively related to MND1. Red represents positively related genes
  and blue represents negatively related genes. B Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of MND1-related genes
  in LIHC. C Pearson correlation analysis of MND1 and cell cycle-related genes (CDC25A,
  CDC25C, CDC25, CHAF1A, CDK1, FEN1, MCM2, MCM3, CDT1) in TCGA-Liver Hepatocellular
  Carcinoma (LIHC) dataset
article_title: Meiotic nuclear divisions 1 promotes proliferation and metastasis in
  hepatocellular carcinoma and is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target gene.
