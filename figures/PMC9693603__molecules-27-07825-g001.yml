caption: 'Effect of azilsartan on the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
  cell lines and MCF 10A breast normal epithelial cells. (A,C,E) Representative images
  of the MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF 10A cell lines, respectively, before and after
  treatment with azilsartan at different concentrations for 48 h. (B,D,F) Percentage
  of viability of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF 10A cell lines, respectively, after treatment
  with azilsartan for 48 h at different concentrations. Data represent mean Â± SD,
  n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, where: ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, compared to untreated cells.'
