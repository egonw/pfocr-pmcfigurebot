caption: Minoxidil, GPHD, and damulin B activate the Wnt/β–catenin pathway and Akt
  signaling pathway in hDPCs. hDPCs were treated with minoxidil, GPHD, and damulin
  B in a concentration-dependent (A–C) or time-dependent manner (D,E). Western blot
  analysis was performed, and the level of the indicated protein was quantified. The
  results shown are representative of three independent experiments. p-value < 0.05
  was considered statistically significant; individual p-values (* p < 0.05; ** p
  < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005) are indicated.
