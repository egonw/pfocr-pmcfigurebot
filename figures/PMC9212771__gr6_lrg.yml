caption: Pathway of COVID-19 represented in KEGG. Common up-regulated genes were located
  in the proposed pathway of COVID-19 using KEGG mapper online tool. Colored genes
  are shown to be significantly up-regulated in our study and intensity of color shows
  the Log2 FC. Red shows the highest and yellow shows the lowest Log2 FC. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)
