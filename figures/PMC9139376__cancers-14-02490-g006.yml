caption: MiRNA/mRNA interaction networks of the 10 most deregulated miRNAs in 3D cell
  cultures. The graph shows the interaction network of the 10 most downregulated miRNAs
  in 3D organotypic cultures (upper panel) and the 10 most upregulated miRNAs (bottom
  panel) with their target mRNAs involved in hypoxia, Wnt/β-catenin, cell cycle, apoptosis,
  TGFβ, JAK/STAT3, NOTCH, P53, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  signaling pathways using Cytoscape software. The blue rectangle indicates the nodes
  represented by miRNAs, and the different colored ovals corresponding to each signaling
  pathway indicate the target mRNAs of the corresponding miRNAs.
