caption: RV infection and SPT deficiency induce similar changes in lung epithelial
  gene expression for sphingolipid synthesis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of
  differentially expressed genes within the sphingolipid synthesis pathway (GO:0030148)
  for (A) lung, (B) lung EpCAM+ cells, and (C) lung CD45+ cells. Shown are results
  of hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes of Co + RV, SPT, and
  SPT + RV versus Co mice, with nominal P value less than 0.05. Data represent four
  mice per group for all groups, except those removed after not meeting quality control
  standards, including one Co sample in the lung and EpCAM+ cell analyses and one
  SPT + RV sample in the CD45+ analyses.
