caption: Focal adhesion kinase plays a crucial role in several signaling pathways
  that promote migration, proliferation, and survival. Upon its activation, focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK) directly binds PI3K, leading to the activation of Akt. Activated
  Akt then stimulates numerous cellular functions including cell survival, proliferation,
  and migration via various signaling cascades depending on the cell type and species.
  In addition, FAK may recruit Grb2 and subsequently activate the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway,
  enhancing cell proliferation and motility. Finally, FAK may directly bind to paxillin
  and p130Cas, promoting lamellipodium formation, and thus migration via Rac GTPase
  activation.
