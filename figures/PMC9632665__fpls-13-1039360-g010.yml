caption: Proposed schematic representation of soluble sugars (A) and malic acid (B)
  metabolic pathway in fruit cell. SUT, sucrose transporters; CWINT, cell wall invertase;
  HT - hexose transporters; HK, hexokinase; FK, fructokinase; SPS, sucrose phosphate
  synthase; SS, sucrose synthase; SPP, sucrose-phosphate phosphatase; SWEET, sugars
  will eventually be exported transporter; PK, phosphokinase; PPDK, pyruvate phosphate
  dikinase; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; NADP-ME, NADP-dependent malic enzyme;
  NAD-MDH, NAD-malate dehydrogenase; ALMT, aluminium activated malate transporter;
  tDt, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.
