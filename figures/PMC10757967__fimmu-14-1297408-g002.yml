caption: Molecular mechanisms of necroptosis A wide range of signals act as an inducer
  of necroptosis. TNFR1 bound with TNFα promotes the recruitment of TRADD to assembly
  complex I, which comprises TRAF2, RIPK1, cIAP1/2, and LUBAC. cIAP1/2 and LUBAC catalyze
  the connection of K63- and M1-linked ubiquitin chains to RIPK1, which provides a
  platform for the recruitment of TAK1, TAB2/3, and the IKK complex consisting of
  NEMO, IKKα, and IKKβ. The kinases mentioned above can inhibit the activity of RIPK1
  through phosphorylation to counteract the shift from complex I to complex II. In
  addition, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways are activated downstream of the kinases
  mentioned above to induce survival. NF-κB facilitates the synthesis of cFLIP, which
  inhibits the activity of caspase 8 (CASP8). Upon blocking NF-κB, TRADD assembles
  with FADD and CASP8 to form complex IIa, which mediates RIPK1-independent apoptosis.
  In certain cases, including cIAP1/2 or LUBAC inhibition and CYLD-mediated RIPK1
  deubiquitination, RIPK1 is dissociated from complex I to form complex IIb with FADD
  and CASP8, inducing RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. Inactivating CASP8 is a prerequisite
  for the detachment of RIPK1 from complex IIb. RIPK1 is supposed to undergo conformational
  changes through autophosphorylation and interact with RIPK3 through the RHIM domain.
  Phosphorylated RIPK3 is oligomerized to recruit and activate MLKL, leading to the
  assembly of the necrosome. The activated MLKL oligomer is translocated to the cell
  membrane, mediating membrane perforation and necroptosis. In addition to TNFα, the
  connection of FasL to Fas and TRAIL to TRAILR transfers a pro-necroptotic signal.
  DISC comprises FADD and CASP8 to induce apoptosis. Under cIAP1/2 inhibition, DISC
  associates with RIPK1 to form complex IIb, which can transfer to the necrosome with
  CASP8 inhibition. TLR3/4 recruits RHIM-containing TRIF in the intracellular domain
  after dsRNA and LPS are identified, to directly activate the RIPK3/MLKL pathway
  and thereby trigger necroptosis. ZBP connected to Z-DNA interacts with RIPK3 through
  the RHIM domain to stimulate downstream MLKL and induce necroptosis. TNF-α, tumor
