caption: 'ROC curves for identifying characteristic metabolic molecules predictive
  of RE and SARE. (a/d: urine sample, b/e: serum sample, c/f: fecal supernatant sample.
  The RE-predictive metabolites were serum AA (AUC = 0.6322, P = 0.002), urinary hydroquinone
  (AUC = 0.6429, P = 0.001), and serum fumaric acid (AUC = 0.6399, P = 0.001), and
  SARE-predictive metabolites were fecal phenethylamine (AUC = 0.6193, P = 0.016)
  and urinary hydroquinone (AUC = 0.6866, P = 0.002). ROC curve analyses were used
  for metabolic characterization in RE/SARE patients, and the differences were considered
  significant when the P value was ≤0.05.).'
