figure_title: Phenotypic responses to BET inhibition in resistant cells
caption: (A) Representative images (20×, bright field) of cellular morphology changes
  in response to BETi (48 h, 1 μM JQ1).(B) The BETi induces increased motility of
  HCC1954 (top) and no substantial difference in SKOV3 (bottom) as monitored across
  time points with a wound scratching assay.(C) Drug-induced changes in membrane fluidity
  (mean of triplicates, error bars represent ±SEM) in HCC1954 and SKOV3 cells based
  on fluorescent lipophilic pyrene probes that are enriched in excimer state (emission
  = 470 nm) with increasing membrane fluidity and enriched in monomers (emission =
  400 nm) with decreasing membrane fluidity.(D) The representative images of HER2/EGFR
  localization changes in response to BET inhibition (48 h, 1 μM). Images are collected
  using fluorescent confocal microscopy (20×). The fluorescence signals from EGFR/HER2
  (green) in BETi-treated HCC1954 cells suggest increased localization of the receptors.
  The EGFR/HER2 signal was unchanged in response to BETi in SKOV3.(E) The proposed
  mechanism of BET inhibition-induced vulnerability to BET and MCL1 co-targeting in
  the context of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications or gains based on the integrated
  multi-omics, network, and perturbation analyses. The marked genes and proteins are
  identified and validated in molecular perturbation response analyses.
