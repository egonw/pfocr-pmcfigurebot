caption: 'Effects of Dyglomera® on WATs in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity.
  (A) The WATs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and observed under a
  microscope. (B) The WATs were weighed. Scale bar = 100 μm. ## p < 0.01 between normal
  diet (ND) group and high fat diet (HFD) group. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 between
  HFD group and Dyglomera® treated group.'

  the AMPK Signaling Pathway in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and Mice with High-Fat Diet-Induced
  Obesity.
