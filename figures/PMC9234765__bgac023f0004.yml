caption: 'Effect of topical application of silibinin on proliferation and Hh-signaling
  pathway during short-term chronic UVB exposure-induced BCC in Ptch+/– mice. Immunohistochemical
  staining was done to assess expression of Ki67, Gli1 and Smo in response to short-term
  chronic UVB exposure (26 weeks) with or without silibinin in female (F), male (M)
  and total (M + F) Ptch+/– mice. Pictorial and data representation for (A) % Ki67
  positive cells, (B) Smo expression as immunopositivity score, (C) Gli1 expression
  as immunopositivity score. Microscopic quantification of DAB staining was done in
  five randomly selected areas at ×400 magnification per sliver and then an average
  count of 4 slivers was considered. For Ki67 expression analysis, % of positively
  stained (brown nucleus) cells were counted. For Smo and Gli-1 expression analysis,
  intensity of brown color was assessed as immunopositivity scores and assigned arbitrary
  values: 0 (no staining), +1 (weak), +2 (moderate), +3 (strong) and +4 (very strong).
  For Smo expression, overall cellular staining was observed (which included cytoplasmic
  + nuclear staining). For Gli-1 expression, prominently nuclear staining was observed.
  Columns indicate median [95% CI]; nsP > 0.05; *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001.
  All images were captured at ×100 magnification. SB, silibinin (9 mg/200 µl acetone).'
