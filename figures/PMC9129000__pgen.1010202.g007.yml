figure_title: Synergistic effect of radA with recA3 but not with recG1 is consistent
  with a role in the RECA2-dependent pathway
caption: '(A) Crosses of recG1-2 and radA-1 (pollen donor) showed that double homozygote
  recG1 radA plants are as affected in development as simple homozygote radA plants.
  Contrarily, double homozygote recA3 radA do not grow roots and are lethal at the
  seedling stage, a phenotype similar to the one of recA2. The scale bar is 1 mm.
  (B) qPCR scanning of relative copy numbers of the different mtDNA regions, as described
  in , in pools of recA3, recA2 and recA3 radA seedlings. Results were compared to
  those of WT seedling of same size, and are represented in log2 scale. (C) RADA interacts
  with RECA2, but not with RECA1 or with RECA3, on a yeast two-hybrid assay. Serial
  dilutions of cell suspensions were spotted. BD and AD are the binding and activating
  domains of GAL4, respectively. Replicate experiments with two independent yeast
  colonies co-transformed with both plasmids (#1 and #2) confirmed this result, and
  controls with empty vectors showed that there was no autoactivation by either BD:RADA
  or AD:RECA2 (lower panel). The interaction between the F-box protein EBF2 and EIN3
  was used as positive control.'
article_title: RADA-dependent branch migration has a predominant role in plant mitochondria
  and its defect leads to mtDNA instability and cell cycle arrest.
