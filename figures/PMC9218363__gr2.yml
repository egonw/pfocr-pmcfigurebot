caption: PPP2CA/B expression is lower in FOLFOX-non-responsive (NR) versus responsive
  (R) CRC tumors, which negatively correlated with the expression of AKT1, mTOR, 4EBP1,
  and CDKN1AData were analyzed from the NCBI GEO accession number GSE72970. Number
  of samples in the NR and R groups was 61 and 63, respectively. The p value is shown
