caption: Systemic metabolic changes associated with a ketogenic diet. Global metabolic
  profiling was performed on serum from mice fed a KD or SD (n = 6/group). (A) Significantly
  altered metabolites were classified into major metabolic pathways, and the differential
  abundance (DA) scores of each pathway were plotted. (B) Metabolic profiles of KD
  and SD were classified into lipid, nucleotides and peptides, amino acids, carbohydrates,
  and cofactor and vitamin metabolism. Values from each metabolite were used to calculate
  log2 (fold change KD/SD) and plotted againstâ€”Log10 (p-value) to generate a volcano
  plot. Metabolites with >2-fold change and with a p value < 0.05 were considered
  to be above the threshold (solid circles or diamonds). Metabolites with <2-fold
  change or with a p value > 0.05 were below the threshold (empty circles). Lipids
  with significant p values were characterized into 3 groups (saturated, unsaturated,
  and unclassified) based on saturation levels and their abundance and depicted as
  a pie chart.
