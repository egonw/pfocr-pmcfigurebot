caption: 'Nrf-2-mediated antioxidant pathway of pterostilbene: Activation and phosphorylation
  of Nrf-2 signaling is the major mechanism through which the antioxidative response
  is induced by PTS. Ubiquitination mediated by Cullin-3 (CUL-3) leads to the proteasomal
  degradation of Nrf-2. PTS inhibits the ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system, thereby increasing
  the accumulation of Nrf-2. PTS also enables the phosphorylation of Nrf-2, which
  is critical in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor. Moreover,
  PTS phosphorylates and activates the ERK signaling pathway, which mediates the dissociation
  of Keap-1, resulting in Nrf-2 activation. Furthermore, PTS stimulates the binding
  of Keap-1 and p62, which enhances the activation of Nrf2. Following its activation
  and nuclear translocation, Nrf-2 binds to ARE and induces the expression of antioxidant
  enzymes, which in turn critically attenuate oxidative damage in host cells.'
