caption: The working model of how the FA pathway orchestrates PGC development. PGCs
  encounter frequent TRCs during rapid division, and TRCs impede replication and transcription
  progression, causing frequent RF stalling and R-loop accumulation. Consequently,
  ATR kinase activates the FA pathway to handle TRCs and R-loops and stabilize stalled
  RFs. The obstacle is removed and forks restart following FA pathway activation to
  ensure faithful replication of genome, thus maintaining PGC genome stability during
  their active proliferation stage. When the FA pathway is disrupted, a failure to
  resolve TRCs and R-loops in a timely manner and destabilization of stalled forks
  result in fork collapse and DNA damage. The accumulation of DNA damage activates
  p53 signaling to trigger G2-phase arrest of PGCs. Prolonged G2 phase impairs cell
  expansion and ultimately leads to a dramatic loss of PGCs.
