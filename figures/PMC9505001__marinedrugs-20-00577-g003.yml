caption: IPP production in transgenic algae. (a) IPP detected by LC-MS/MS in the extraction
  agent from cultivated algal cells. Three biological replicates were used to calculate
  the IPP yield averages and SDs. One-way ANOVA was used for the statistical analyses.
  Different letters (a–e) indicate significant differences (p ≤ 0.01). (b) IPP production
  of transgenic algae (V4-49) grown in a TAP medium supplemented with various concentrations
  of isoprenol. Three biological replicates were used to calculate the IPP yield averages
  and SDs. Statistical significance (one-way ANOVA) compared to 0 mM is represented
  by asterisks (** indicates a difference at the p ≤ 0.01 level).
