caption: Rg3 activates NRF2 signaling in pancreatic tissues from mice with AP. (A)
  Western blot analysis revealed that NRF2, HO-1, GPX4 and xCT expression was significantly
  reduced in pancreatic tissues from mice with AP. (B) Rg3 treatment significantly
  increased NRF2, HO-1, GPX4 and xCT expression. Each band represents tissue from
  each mouse in the specific group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 compared with
  the Con or AP group. NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; HO-1, heme
  oxygenase 1; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; xCT, cystine/glutamate transporter;
  AP, acute pancreatitis; Con, control; L-Rg3, low-dose Rg3 (20 mg/kg); H-Rg3, high-dose
  Rg3 (40 mg/kg).
