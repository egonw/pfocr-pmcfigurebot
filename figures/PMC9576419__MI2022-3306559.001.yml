caption: 'Expression of visfatin in septic mice. (a and b) Dynamic changes in visfatin
  levels in the serum and heart were detected in mice with LPS-induced septicemia.
  (c) Cardiac visfatin expression was detected in saline- and LPS-treated mice (200×).
  (d) Visfatin expression in cardiac macrophages was detected (200×). N = 5 in each
  group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the saline group. #p < 0.05 vs. the previous group.'
