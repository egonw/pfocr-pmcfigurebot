caption: Hypothetical diagram summarizing the pathogenesis of human PKD hearts. We
  hypothesize that hearts from PKD patients are infiltrated by macrophages secreting
  local TGF-β1 Subsequent activation of TGF-β1 receptor results in overexpression
  of pSMAD3 and β-catenin. Translocation of pSMAD3 and β-catenin to the myocyte nucleus
  further substantiate the fibrotic pathway activation. The over-expression of TGF-β1
  receptor further exacerbates the activation of fibrotic pathways resulting in hypertrophy
  characterized by increases in myocyte/nucleus size and perivascular/interstitial
  fibrosis
article_title: Hypertrophic and fibrotic human PKD hearts are associated with macrophage
  infiltration and abnormal TGF-β1 signaling.
