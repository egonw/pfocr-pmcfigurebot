figure_title: Larger pleiotropic expression effects of trans-regulatory mutants correlate
  with negative fitness effects
caption: (A) A heatmap shows log2 fold changes for all genes not downstream of TDH3
  as estimated by DESeq2, in which rows are genes and columns are mutants. Color intensity
  is scaled by row (by gene) and corresponds to z-scores. Hierarchical clustering
  of mutants is shown by the dendrogram above. Three of the four trans-regulatory
  mutants bearing mutations in the adenine biosynthesis pathway cluster together and
  are marked by a blue dot and line. The cis-regulatory mutant overexpressing TDH3
  clusters with IRA2 (green), while the cis-regulatory mutants with reduced TDH3 expression
  cluster together (orange). A large cluster of trans-regulatory mutants with small
  effects across the genome are marked by a purple dot and line. (B) For all trans-regulatory
  mutants, the number of downstream genes differentially expressed is positively correlated
  with the number of genes differentially expressed in parallel to TDH3 in that mutant.
  (C) For both cis- (orange) and trans- (blue) regulatory mutants, the total number
  of differentially expressed genes is a strong predictor of relative fitness. A linear
  model is shown with grey shading representing 95% confidence intervals and two outliers,
  IRA2 and NAM7 are indicated. (D) For all trans-regulatory mutants with fitness data
  (i.e., excluding the two flocculant strains), the pleiotropic fitness effect, as
  defined in , is plotted vs the number of genes differentially expressed in parallel
  to TDH3 in that trans-regulatory mutant. A linear regression is shown in black with
  95% confidence intervals in grey.
