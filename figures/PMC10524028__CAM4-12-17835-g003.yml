caption: 'Immune cell infiltration characteristics in four Bases and results of pathway
  analysis. (A) REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis of each Basis. −log10 (entity
  p‐value) >1 or < −1 is indicated in red. (B) Heatmap of the immune cell fraction
  from the results of CIBERSORT analysis. Differences in immune cell fractions among
  Bases 1–4 were selected (one‐way ANOVA: p < 0.05). (C) Fraction of M1 macrophages
  in the four Bases.'
