caption: A simple flowchart analyzing the cold resistance of LV-T and LV-C shrimp.
  (A) Thermogenesis-reference pathway and the joint action of related signaling pathways
  to produce heat; (B) represents differentially methylated genes between the two
  groups, with red indicating hypermethylation, green indicating hypomethylation,
  gray indicating both hyper and hypomethylation, and white indicating no methylation;
  and (C) corresponds to the differential gene expression shown in B, with values
  shown as Log2 ratio.
