caption: ZKSCAN3 upregulation in the early stage of the adenoma–carcinoma sequence.
  (A) Distribution of IHC scores in the normal colonic epithelium (NM; n = 38), non-neoplastic
  hyperplastic polyps (HPP; n = 31), adenomas (AD; n = 34), adenocarcinomas (AC; n
  = 30), and their representative microscopic images (right panel). Optical magnification,
  ×100. Red bars represent the median with quartiles of the IHC scores. Statistical
  significance was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s test (* p <
  0.01). (B) Representative ZKSCAN3 IHC images of adenoma with dysplasia. Optical
  magnification, ×200 (left panel) and ×400 (right panel). (C) Gene copy numbers of
  normal epithelium (n = 14), non-neoplastic hyperplastic polyps (n = 16), dysplastic
  adenomas (n = 14), and adenocarcinomas (n = 22). (D) Correlation between IHC scores
  of ZKSCAN3 and β-catenin. Data were obtained from 29 cases of adenomas and analyzed
  through Pearson correlation (p < 0.01). Representative IHC images are shown in the
  right panel. Optical magnification, 100 (middle panel) and ×200 (right panel). ns,
  not significant.
