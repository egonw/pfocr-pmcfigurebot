caption: 'Phagocytic signaling pathways. a) Gene expression in phagocytic signaling
  pathways. “‐”: the material without NIR irradiation; “+”: the material under NIR
  irradiation at a power density of 0.5 W cm−2. b) Immunohistochemical staining for
  TNF‐α protein. c) Western blot characterization of C3 complement protein and branched
  chain and d) quantitative analysis of corresponding protein expression. e) Quantitative
  analysis of TNF‐α protein by immunohistochemical staining. f) Macrophage, CD11b
  protein, and nuclear markers. (F4/80: green; CD11b: red; Nucleus: blue) in the surrounding
  tissues after 7 and 14 days of implantation in the percutaneous implantation infected
  model. g) Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of phagocytosis pathway. Data represent
  means ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance was calculated by two‐way ANOVA analysis
  and Tukey''s multiple comparison tests. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 compared
  with SP‐. &p < 0.05 compared with SPPM‐. #p < 0.05 compared with SP+.'
