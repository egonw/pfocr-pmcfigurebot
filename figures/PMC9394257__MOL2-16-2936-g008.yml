caption: Transcriptome profiling revealed a set of genes that are significantly dysregulated
  miR‐30e expressing 22Rv‐1 cells. (A) Hierarchical clustering analysis showing top
  differentially expressed genes between the induced 22Rv‐1‐30e cells (E group) compared
  to uninduced control group (C group). The rows represent the genes, whereas the
  columns represent the samples. Red color indicates higher expression and blue color
  indicates lower expression. Statistical analysis using parametric F‐test comparing
  nested linear models with *P < 0.05 significance by r package edger. (B). Principle
  component analysis (PCA) of three biological replicates of induced 22Rv‐1 cells
  (E group) and uninduced group (C group) showing distinct differences in gene expression
  profiles between two groups. (C, D) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the
  differentially expressed genes using the Fisher exact t‐test assuming binomial distribution
  in Enrichr software with *P ≤ 0.05 showing the circular plots of top altered GO
  terms based on biological processes (BP) of downregulated (C) and upregulated genes
  (D). (E) Bar chart showing the number of genes altered for specific GO term for
  downregulated genes based on 8 biological processes (BP), 7 cellular components
  (CC) and 7 molecular functions (MF). (F) Bar chart showing the number of genes altered
  for specific GO term for upregulated genes based on 8 biological processes (BP),
  7 cellular components (CC) and 7 molecular functions (MF). (G) KEGG pathway analysis
  for the downregulated genes using the Fisher exact t‐test assuming binomial distribution
  in Enrichr software with *P ≤ 0.05 showing the bar chart depicting the top 15 pathways
  that were altered for the downregulated genes in the induced 22Rv‐1‐30e cells compared
  to the uninduced control. (H) KEGG pathway analysis for the upregulated genes using
  the Fisher exact t‐test assuming binomial distribution in Enrichr software with
  *P ≤ 0.05 showing the bar chart depicting the top 15 pathways that were altered
  for the downregulated genes in the induced 22Rv‐1‐30e cells compared to the uninduced
  control. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
