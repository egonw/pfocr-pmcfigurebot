caption: 'Expression of CX3CR1, FKN, NR2A, and NR2B in neuronal cells under HCS. (a)
  Expression picture in each group. (b) Comparison of protein expression of CX3CR1,
  FKN, NR2A, and NR2B in hippocampal neurons of each group under coculture. Note that,
  compared with the normal group, #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01; compared with the model
  group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.'
