caption: 'The unique GRNs of DETFs from the patients with severe COVID-19. A. GRNs
  related to response to a decreased oxygen level (GO:0036293); DNA damage response
  (GO:0030330); negative regulation of the mitotic cell cycle (GO:0045930); and the
  intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:0097193). B. GRNs related to the microtubule
  organizing center (GO:0005851). The edges are shown if their absolute Pearson correlation
  coefficients are larger than 0.4. DETFs: differentially expressed transcription
  factors.'
