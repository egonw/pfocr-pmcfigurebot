caption: Functional states of CTSZ and enrichment analysis. (A) The functional states
  of CTSZ across nine types of cancer by CancerSEA. The red plots indicate that CTSZ
  was positively correlated with the functional states, while the blue plots indicate
  that CTSZ was negatively correlated with the functional states. (B) CTSZ expression
  level and the corresponding tumor stemness score and tumor angiogenesis score of
  each patient with ccRCC. (C) Scatterplots of correlations between CTSZ expression
  and stemness of ccRCC. (D) Scatterplots of correlations between CTSZ expression
  and angiogenesis of ccRCC. (E) CTSZ expression level and the corresponding tumor
  angiogenesis score of each patient with ccRCC. (F) Scatterplots of correlations
  between CTSZ expression and apoptosis of ccRCC. The top 10 positively (G) and negatively
  (H) related genes. GO analysis (I) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (J) of CTSZ
  coexpressed genes. Immune-related results of GO enrichment analysis were visualized
  in chord (K) and GOCircle plots (L). ***P < 0.001.
