figure_title: CFTR regulates FeCl3-induced mesenteric arteriole thrombosis
caption: a Representative images and time courses of FeCl3-induced mesenteric arteriole
  thrombus formation in CftrPKO and Ctrl mice. Time after FeCl3-induced injury is
  indicated at the low right corner of each image. Scale bars, 500 μm. b Summary of
  the time to first thrombi and maximal thrombus size of arterioles from the result
  of FeCl3-induced thrombosis in CftrPKO and Ctrl mice in Fig. 2a. (n = 8 mice per
  group; unpaired t test). c WT mice were intravenously injected with CFTRinh-172
  (2 mg/kg every day, 24 h) or the same volume of normal saline containing DSMO as
  a control before FeCl3 injury. Representative images of FeCl3-induced mesenteric
  arteriole thrombosis in WT mice treated with CFTRinh-172 or DMSO as recorded by
  real-time microscopy. Time after FeCl3-induced injury is indicated at the low right
  corner of each image. Scale bars, 500 μm. d Summary of the time to first thrombi
  and maximal thrombus size of arterioles from the result of FeCl3-induced thrombosis
  in WT mice treated with CFTRinh-172 or DMSO in Fig. 2c (n = 7 or 12 mice per group;
  unpaired t test). e, f Tail blood loss and tail bleeding time parameters were investigated
  in CftrPKO and Ctrl mice (n = 12 mice per group; unpaired t test). g Surface expression
  of CD62P (P-selectin) as determined using flow cytometry with PE-conjugated anti-mouse/rat
  CD62P in CftrPKO and Ctrl mice (n = 13 mice per group; unpaired t test). h Representative
  electron microscopy images of platelet ultrastructure from Ctrl and CftrPKO mice.
  Scale bars, 2.0 μm (top) and 500 nm (bottom). Quantification of α-granules (white
  arrow) and dense granules (black arrow) per platelet from Ctrl and CftrPKO platelets.
  (n = 23–25; unpaired t test). Data are presented as mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001. ns not significant
