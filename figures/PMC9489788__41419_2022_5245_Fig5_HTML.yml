figure_title: MiR-663b can reverse the inhibitive effects of circ_0003215 in CRC cells
caption: A Correlation analysis between the expression levels of circ_0003215 and
  miR-663b expression. B FISH analysis of circ_0003215(red) and miR-663b(green) in
  HT29 cells transfected with empty vector or circ_0003215 plasmid. C, D CCK8 and
  EdU analysis of the proliferation capacities in HT29 or SW480 cells with diferent
  transfection. E Colony formation assay of HT29 or SW480 cells transfected with diferent
  transfection F Wound healing assay to evaluate the cell migration of HT29 cells
  with diferent transfection. G, H Transwell assay for the invasion and migration
  ability of CRC cells transfected with indicated vectors. Graph represents mean ± SD;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
