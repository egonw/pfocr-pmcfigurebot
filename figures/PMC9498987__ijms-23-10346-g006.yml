caption: CpEA and hesperetin inactivated the Akt/Erk/c-Jun signaling pathway in Spike-S1-induced
  A549 cells. A549 lung cells were pre-treated with CpEA at a concentration of 0–200
  μg/mL or hesperetin at a concentration of 0–40 μg/mL for 24 h, and then exposed
  to Spike S1 for 3 h. The inhibitory effects of CpEA (A) and hesperetin (B) on the
  phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, and c-Jun proteins in A549 cells were displayed
  in Western blot and band density measurements. The Spike S1-induced A549 cells are
  presented as 100% of control. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. values of three
  independent experiments, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. the Spike S1-induced
  A549 cells.
