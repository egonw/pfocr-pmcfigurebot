figure_title: IGF2BP3 regulates the stability of EGFR mRNA
caption: a Gene ontology and KEGG analysis of IGF2BP3 knockout SW480 cells. b Heat
  maps of key genes in each pathway. c The relative protein expressions of IGF2BP3,
  EGFR, p-ERK, p-JNK were measured by Western Blot in Caco2, RKO, SW480, and HCT116
  cells after overexpression or knockdown/knockout of IGF2BP3, n = 3, nonparametric
  Mann Whitney test. d The EGFR mRNA half-life (t1/2) was detected by real-time PCR
  in Caco2 cells transfected with vector or IGF2BP3 (up) and SW480 cells transfected
  with scramble or IGF2BP3-sg (down). n = 3, nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
article_title: IGF2BP3 promotes the progression of colorectal cancer and mediates
  cetuximab resistance by stabilizing EGFR mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner.
