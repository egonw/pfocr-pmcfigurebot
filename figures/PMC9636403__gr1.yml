caption: Coexpression network of THRLBCL immune genes. (A) The 3 highest score gene
  modules identified in the discovery set were interrogated in terms of functional
  pathway analysis by using the Metascape tool. Each gene is colored in light blue,
  light green, and dark green according to the gene module to which they belong. (B)
  Three high score gene modules were identified in the in silico set by using Metascape.
  Each gene is colored in red, purple, and blue according to the different membership
  module. In panels A and B, the genes are represented by circles, proportional in
  size to the number of genes of each module. The thickness of edges indicates the
  similarity score. The red dashed line highlights the axis PD-1/CD274 (PD-L1).
article_title: The identification of TCF1+ progenitor exhausted T cells in THRLBCL
  may predict a better response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
