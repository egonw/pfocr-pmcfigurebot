caption: The levels of gene expression related to the heme biosynthetic pathway were
  compared between KL+ and KL–, showing that JTT upregulated genes involved in heme
  synthesis in blood. (A) The heme biosynthetic pathway is initiated by the synthesis
  of the amino acids glycine and succinyl CoA. Heme is synthesized via 5-aminolevulinate,
  porphobilinogen, hydroxymethylbilane, uroporphyrinogen III, coproporphyrinogen III,
  protoporphyrinogen IX, and protoporphyrin IX as intermediates. (B) Comparison of
  RNA-seq data (upper) and q-PCR data (lower) of nine gene expression levels involved
  with the heme biosynthesis pathway. We compared the expression of mRNA from KL+
  (red) and KL– (gray). (C) The data by q-PCR for the expression of mRNA for nine
  genes involved in hem biosynthesis and the fold change for the average value of
  the sample with JTT (Kampo-average) to the average value of the sample without JTT
  (Normal-average).
