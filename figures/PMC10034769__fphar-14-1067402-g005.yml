caption: 'Urolithin A (UA) increased Nrf2 expression in LPS-mediated BEAS-2B cells
  and ALI models. (A,C) Quantification of Keap1, Nrf2, HO1, and NQO1 levels in BEAS-2B
  cells. (B,D) Quantification of Keap1, Nrf2, HO1, and NQO1 levels within lung tissues.
  (E) Representative immunofluorescence images showed Nrf2 in BEAS-2B cells. (F) Typical
  IHC images showed the Nrf2 in lung tissues. The results were represented by mean
  Â± SD. ## p < 0.01 and ns in comparison to LPS and control groups, respectively.'
