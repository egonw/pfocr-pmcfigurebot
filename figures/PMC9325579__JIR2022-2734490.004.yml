caption: 'Distribution of enriched KEGG pathways of cluster A: 18 miRNAs consistently
  deregulated in AbP or recent T1D groups (13 of them being also deregulated in T1D
  2-5y). The chart shows category rankings. The X-axis value represents the number
  of microRNA''s targets in the pathway and the Y-axis the pathways. (a) Represents
  the potential genes from up-expressed microRNAs. (b) Represents the potential genes
  from down-expressed microRNAs in comparison with controls. AbP group (individuals
  without diabetes expressing islet autoantibody); recent T1D group (newly diagnosed
  T1D patients with duration â‰¤6 months); T1D 2-5y group (patients with T1D with 2
  to 5 years of duration); IAA: insulin autoantibody; GADA: glutamic acid decarboxylase
  autoantibody; IA-2A: tyrosine phosphatase autoantibody; ZnT8A: zinc transport 8
  autoantibody; only target genes identified by 20% or more of the DEMs with seed
  of conserved 7-8 mers were submitted to functional enrichment analysis.'
