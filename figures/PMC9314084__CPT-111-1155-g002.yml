caption: 'B‐cell receptor signaling score. NanoString pathway analysis for B‐cell
  receptor signaling (BCR) related genes calculates a score for each patient based
  on the overall expression of BCR genes. (a) This BCR score was significantly higher
  in nonresponders compared with responders (P = 0.006). (b) A significant association
  was found between this BCR score and the timing of acute rejection (AR) irrespective
  of response to alemtuzumab (nonresponders: early vs. late P < 0.001, responders:
  early vs. late P = 0.030). Among the patients with late rejections, nonresponders
  had a significantly higher BCR score compared with responders (P = 0.033). [Colour
