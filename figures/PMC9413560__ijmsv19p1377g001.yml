caption: Differentially expressed circRNAs in osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts as
  well as enrichment analysis of related pathways. (A) Hierarchical cluster analysis
  of differentially expressed circRNAs. In the heatmap, red represents high expression,
  and green represents low expression. The columns represent cells, and the rows represent
  different circRNAs. (B) Volcano map showing differentially expressed circRNAs. The
  vertical line represents a multiple of 1.5, and the horizontal line indicates a
  p value equal to 0.05. (C-D) The KEGG database was used for pathway enrichment analysis
  of circRNAs. (E) Schematic illustration of hsa_circ_0087302 formation and the results
  of Sanger sequencing.
article_title: Hsa_circ_0087302, a circular RNA, affects the progression of osteosarcoma
  via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
