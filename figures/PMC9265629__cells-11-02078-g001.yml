caption: Integrin β3 and AXL were significantly upregulated in erlotinib-resistant
  (HCC827 ER and HCC4006 ER) cell lines compared with parental (HCC827 and HCC4006)
  NSCLC cell lines. (A,B) The mRNA levels of integrin β3 and AXL were determined by
  qRT-PCR in erlotinib-resistant cells compared with parental cells. GAPDH was used
  as a loading control. (C,D) Western blot assays showing integrin β3 and AXL expression
  in erlotinib-resistant and parental cells. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  n = 3 independent experiments.
