caption: ANGPT2 upregulation in esophageal cancer tissue and cell lines and is associated
  with poor patient prognosis. (A) ANGPT2 was upregulated in patients with esophageal
  cancer. *P<0.05 vs. normal. (B) ANGPT2 upregulation was significantly associated
  with low overall survival rate of patients with esophageal cancer. (C) Relative
  mRNA expression of ANGPT2 in normal HEEC and esophageal cancer cell lines was detected
  using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (D) Protein expression of ANGPT2 in
  normal HEEC and esophageal cancer cell lines was detected using western blotting.
  ***P<0.001 vs. HEEC. ANGPT2, angiopoietin-2; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; HEEC, human
  esophageal epithelial cell; TPM, transcripts per million.
article_title: HOXB5-activated ANGPT2 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion
  and angiogenic effect of esophageal cancer cells via activating ERK/AKT signaling
  pathway.
