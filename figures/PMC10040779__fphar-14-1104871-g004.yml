caption: Ginaton decreases Ang II-induced M1 phenotype macrophage activation and inflammation
  through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Ginaton (300 mg/kg/day) or PBS (internal control)
  was administered intragastrically to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice were then infused
  with Ang II (1,000 ng/kg/min) or saline for 14 days. (A) Immunofluorescence staining
  in cardiac sections with CD68 and iNOS antibodies (left, n = 6, scale bar = 50 μm)
  and quantification of CD68+ and iNOS+ macrophages in heart sections (right, n =
  6). (B) Immunofluorescence staining of cardiac sections with CD68 and CD206 antibodies
  (left, n = 6, scale bar = 50 μm) and quantification of CD68+ and CD206+ macrophages
  in heart sections (right, n = 6). (C) qPCR analyses of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1
  mRNA levels (n = 6). (D) qPCR analyses of Arg1, Ym1, and IL-10 mRNA levels (n =
  6). (E) Western blot analyses of p-IKKα, IKKα, p-P65, P65, and GAPDH expression
  in heart sections (left, n = 4) and the relative protein levels of each (right,
  n = 4).
