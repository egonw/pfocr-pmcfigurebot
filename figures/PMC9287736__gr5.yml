caption: 'Metabolic plasticity breakdown in eWAT. A: Z-score for RNA-seq clusters
  of transcripts sequentially downregulated across the different experimental groups
  (Ctrl n = 8, HFD n = 4, Int n = 4, Int2 n = 4). B: Cumulative number of genes belonging
  to different enriched GOCC terms for each cluster in A. The same GOCC terms are
  indicated from HFD-cluster to Int2-cluster (y-axis), with increasing size (x-axis)
  denoting incremental number of genes for that specific term. C: Profile plot including
  the cluster of proteins that are differentially upregulated with HFD and maintained
  increased after the second intervention (Int2). Blue profiles show proteins specifically
  belonging to KEGG pathway Lysosome within this cluster. D: Heatmap showing Z-scored
  label free quantification (LFQ) intensities of metabolic stress-related proteins
  differentially regulated in Int2 in comparison to Ctrl (n = 3/group). E: Mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) copy number in epididymal white adipose tissue (Ctrl n = 6, HFD n = 6,
  Int n = 6, Int2 n = 5, Ctrl + IF n = 8, HFD + Chow n = 4, HFD + IF n = 10, * indicate
  significant differences with Ctrl group); normalized by Ctrl mice refers to eWAT
  Ctrl group. Ctrl: control; HFD: high fat diet-fed; Int: intervention; Int2: second
  intervention; Ctrl + IF: control + dietary intervention; HFD + Chow: high fat diet-fed + chow
  Ad libitum; HFD + IF: high fat diet-fed + dietary intervention. F–H: Mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) copy number in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) (F), liver
  (G) and skeletal muscle gastrocnemius (H). Data represented as box-and-whiskers
  plots (median, 25th to 75th percentiles and max/min values). ANOVA One-way and Post-hoc
  Tukey, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. (For interpretation
