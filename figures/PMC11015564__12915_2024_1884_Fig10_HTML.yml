caption: The network consisting of three TFs, BbOsrR1, 2, and 3, and cyclin BbClp1
  orchestrates B. bassiana development, oxidative stress responses, and virulence.
  BbOsrR1 negatively regulates BbOsrR2 and BbClp1 transcription via targeting their
  promoters. BbClp1, BbOsrR2, and BbOsrR3 forms a regulatory complex, in which BbClp1
  directly interacts with BbOsrR2 but not with BbOsrR3, with BbClp1 partially regulating
  BbOsrR2 phosphorylation. The network finely regulates fungal conidiation and germination,
  oxidative stress responses, and virulence via control of Fus3-MAPK pathway, fungal
  development, antioxidation and detoxification, and virulence-involved genes
