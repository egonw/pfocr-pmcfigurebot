caption: Planispine A inhibits the FA/BRCA pathway. (A) Immunofluorescence for FANCD2
  foci; percentage of cells with more than 5 foci were determined in at least 150
  cells (60X). Scale bar, 20 μm. (B) Graphical representation FANCD2 foci, n = 3,
  *** p < 0.001 vs. cisplatin. (C) Western blot confirming the inhibition of FANCD2
  monoubiquitination by pre-treatment with planispine A. Densitometry analysis to
  measure the ratio of monoubiquitination FANCD2 to non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 is shown
  below the blot. “+” indicates in presence of drug and “–” indicates without drug.
