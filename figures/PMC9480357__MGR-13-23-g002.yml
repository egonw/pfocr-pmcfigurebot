caption: 'Effect of HBO on the spatial learning and memory ability changes after CO
  poisoning.Note: (A) The swimming path during Morris water maze for each group. (B)
  The escape latency in CO group was significantly longer compared with that in sham
  group, and it was significantly shorter in CO+HBO group compared with that in CO
  group. Data are expressed as mean Â± SD (n = 5), *P < 0.05 (one-way analysis of variance
  followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test). CO: Carbon monoxide; HBO: hyperbaric oxygen.'
