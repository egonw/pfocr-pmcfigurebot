figure_title: Multitude of molecular pathways and physiological systems determining
  mental health
caption: The pattern of synaptic activity representing mood, behavior, consciousness,
  and thus also major depressive disorder (MDD), is governed by the concerted action
  of interrelated molecular pathways and physiological activities. This review exemplified
  molecular links between major systems contributing to the development of MDD. The
  relative contribution of each pathway varies between individual patients as a reflection
  of the high complexity of the disease.
