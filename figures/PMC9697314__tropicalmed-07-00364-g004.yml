caption: 'TGFβ1/SMAD2 signaling pathway in the liver tissue of O. felineus-infected
  Syrian hamsters. (A) Heat map of changes in TGF-β1- and SMAD2-positive cells in
  the course of infection; (B) TGF-β1- and SMAD2-positive cells (marked by an asterisk)
  in the dynamics of infection, IHC study, ×400 magnification; (C) Tgfb1 gene was
  normalized to average Gapdh expression. C—control, 10 w, 30 w, 52 w—week p.i. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM, # p ≤ 0.05, as compared to the control group, * p ≤
  0.05, as compared to the previous period of investigation.'
