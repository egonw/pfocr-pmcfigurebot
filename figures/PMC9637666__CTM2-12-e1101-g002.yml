caption: Endothelial cells communicate with tumour‐associated fibroblast cells. (A)
  The UMAP view of ECs. (B) The relative proportion of ECs in GM and LC. (C) Marker
  gene expression profiles of ECs showed with bubble plots. (D) KEGG pathway enriched
  in ECs. Red colour represents upregulation and blue colour means downregulation.
  (E) The bubble plot showed the expression of cytokines in ECs. (F) The bubble plot
  showed the expression of growth factors in ECs. (G) The expression of EGR1, HIF3A
  and HIF1A in ECs. (H) Bubble plots showed the expression of endothelial function‐associated
  genes. (I) Numbers of inferred interactions between ECs with other cell types. (J)
  Spatial organisation (angle = 165) of fibroblast and ECs in the pseudo‐space inferred
  by CSOmap based on the scRNA‐seq data. Each dot represents a cell, and its colour
  represents the corresponding cell state. (K) The cross‐section of z = 0 of the pseudo‐space.
  The colour of the dots represents cell density. (L) Location of fibroblast and ECs
  in the cross‐section of pseudo‐space z = 0. (M) The difference in cell density between
  cell clusters of fibroblast and ECs. (N) The bubble plot showed the interaction
  between C0 in ECs with fibroblast clusters. Blue represents the ligand in ECs, red
  represents the receptor in fibroblast.
