caption: The Impacts of Somatic Copy Number Alterations in PDAC Cohort. A Significant
  arm-level focal peaks detected using GISTIC. B Focal-level SCNA events. Focal peaks
  with significant copy-number gains (red) and losses (blue) (GISTIC2 FDR < 0.05)
  are shown. The focal peaks are highlighted in approximate positions across the genome.
  C Venn diagram depicting the process of screening for TFs with cis-effect between
  CNA and protein. D The heatmap showing the cis-effect of IRF6 among CNA, RNA, protein,
  and phosphosite (Spearman’s correlation). The P value of correlation is noted on
  the left. E Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival based on mRNA abundance of
  IRF6 (left), and TF activity of IRF6 (right) in Fudan cohort (log-rank test). F
  Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival based on mRNA abundance of IRF6 in TCGA-PAAD
  dataset (log-rank test). G Spearman-rank correlation of the abundance of IRF6 and
  its target genes (Spearman’s correlation). The significant correlations are colored
  in dark gray. Cell cycle and cell proliferation-associated proteins are labeled
  in pink, and prognostic related proteins are labeled with purple circles. H The
  scatter plot describing the Spearman’s correlation between IRF6 protein expression
  and GSVA score of cell proliferation. I Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival
  based on GSVA scores of cell proliferation (log-rank test). J, K The scatter plot
  describing the Spearman’s correlation between MCM4 protein expression and MGPS score
  (J) or tumor size (K). L The systematic diagram summarizing the impact of the cis-effect
  of GRB7 amplification on increasing tumor size. M The boxplot revealing the comparison
  of GSVA score of cell proliferation between the younger patients (≤ 60) and the
  older patients (> 60) (Student’s t test). N The forest plot indicating the hazard
  ratio of KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A, in younger patients (left) and older patients
  (right). O The pathway heatmap indicating the enriched pathways in the four groups
  (TP53 mut, younger patients; WT, younger patients; TP53 mut, older patients; WT,
  older patients). Each column represents a type of sample. The color of each cell
  shows -log10 transformed P value. P Venn diagram depicting the process of screening
  for highly expressed kinase in younger patients with TP53 mutations. Q The boxplot
  revealing the comparison of CDK4 protein expression between TP53 mutations and WT
  both in the younger patients (≤ 60) and the older patients (> 60) (Wilcoxon test).
  R Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival based on CDK4 abundance in the younger
  patients (left) or the older patients (right) (log-rank test). S The heatmap showing
  cell cycle-associated phosphosites which are positively correlated with CDK4. T
  The systematic diagram summarizing the impact of TP53 mutations on promoting cell
  cycle. ****p < 1.0E−4, ***p < 1.0E−3, **p < 1.0E−2, *p < 0.05, ns > 0.05
