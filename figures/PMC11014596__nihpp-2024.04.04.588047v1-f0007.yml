figure_title: Potential neurodegenerative pathways associated with Micro-3 and Macro-8
caption: (A) In the hierarchical clustering of the upregulated KEGG pathways for each
  cluster during the acute SIV infection, there was a category for Micro-3 (left)
  and Macro-8 (right) which enriched with multiple neurodegenerative diseases. There
  were five neurological diseases identified in both clusters, including Prion disease,
  Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis. (B) The genes that were associated with each mapped neurodegenerative
  pathway for Micro-3 (left) and Macro-8 (right).
