caption: 'CircLDLR competition combined with miR-667-5p affects the autophagy pathway.
  A The circLDLR expression level in Hepa1-6 cells was measured via qRT-PCR. **P < 0.01
  vs. vector group. B The expression of the top six candidate miRNAs identified by
  the CircNet database was measured via qRT-PCR in Hepa1-6 cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  vs. vector group. C The underlying binding sequences between circLDLR and miR-667-5p
  were predicted by TargetScan. D The binding association of miR-667-5p with circLDLR
  was validated through a Dual-luciferase assay. *P < 0.05 vs. NC mimic. E and F The
  TG and TC contents in Hepa1-6 cells were measured through enzymatic method. *P < 0.05
  vs. NC mimic group; #P < 0.05 vs. vector group. G LC3 and p62 expressions in Hepa1-6
  cells were measured through western blot and relative quantification. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. vector group; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. circLDLR OE group; &P < 0.05
  vs. vector + miR-667-5p group'
