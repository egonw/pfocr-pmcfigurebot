caption: Prediction of ATF6α's potential activity in PCa using RNA sequencing. (A) ATF6α‐related
  pathways were analyzed by KEGG analysis. (B) GSEA identified a significant association
  between ATF6α and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. (C) Heatmap of significant
  arachidonic acid metabolism‐related genes in LNaP‐AI cells with ATF6α knockdown
  compared with their parental controls. (D) The mRNA levels of the indicated genes
  were validated by qRT‐PCR assays. ATF6α, activating transcription factor 6 α;  GSEA,
  Gene set enrichment analysis; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes; PCa,
  prostate cancer; qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction.**p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, determined by two‐tailed Student's t test [Color figure can be viewed
