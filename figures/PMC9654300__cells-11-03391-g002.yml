caption: Signaling molecules downstream of the B cell receptor that are associated
  with autoimmunity. The signaling pathway downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR)
  contains signaling molecules that are partially shared with other pathways. In particular,
  the BAFF receptor provides essential survival signals and the CD19 co-receptor,
  which is intimately connected to the BCR. Inhibitory signals are provided by the
  kinase CSK and various phosphatases, including SHIP-1 and SHP-1, the activity of
  which is induced by Siglec-10, FcÎ³RIIb, and CD22 surface receptors, as well as PTEN
  and PTPN22. Highlighted signaling molecules have been linked to an increased risk
  in the development of autoimmune disease (yellow), have crucial inhibitory function
  in BCR signaling by preventing autoimmunity (orange), or show increased expression
  and/or activity in B cells from autoimmune disease patients (red). Signaling molecule
  abbreviations are explained in the text.
