caption: Metabolites involved in tocopherol metabolism and Foyer–Halliwell–Asada redox
  cycle. (a) Glutathione, ascorbate, and -tocopherol metabolite levels (AU/mg[FW])
  in Col-0 and rcd1 in control/light conditions (L), and after paraquat exposure (MV)
  and (b) simplified visualization of Foy-er–Halliwell–Asada cycle connected to tocopherol
  redox cycle. (c) Ratios between reduced and oxidized metabolite forms. (d) Phytol,
  phylloquinone, and tocopherol levels in Col-0 and rcd1 in control/light conditions
  (L) and after paraquat exposure (MV) and (e) their biosynthesis pathway. Dots represent
  data points (n = 4–8), the box represents 25 and 75 percentiles; the line marks
  the mean and the whiskers standard deviation. The metabolite levels below limit
  of detection marked as <LOD. The main effects of plant line (L) and treatment (T)
  and their interaction (L × T) were tested with two-way ANOVA (FDR-adjusted p-value
  < 0.05 *, <0.01 **). Tocopherols (β-, γ-, δ-), phytol, and ascorbic acid metabolite
  levels were analyzed with GC-MS in Sipari et al. [] and phylloquinone, glutathione,
  and α-tocopherol metabolite levels with LC-MS.
