caption: Expression levels of different cell sublocalizations and of APT1 after overexpression
  or inhibition of expression of miR-138. (A), expression level of APT1 after overexpression
  or inhibition of expression of miR-138; (B), quantitative analysis of Figure (A)
  for cytoplasmic expression of APT1; (C), quantitative analysis of Figure (A) for
  membrane expression of APT1. Results are shown by mean Â± standard deviation; the
  above experiments were repeated three times; * represents p < 0.05.
