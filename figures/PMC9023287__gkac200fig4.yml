caption: Pan-cancer suppressed CNA pathways. (A) Unusually pervasive suppressed CNA
  pathways. Violin histograms of SWAN scores with blue fill indicating significant
  (FDR < 0.0001) pathway suppression and red fill indicating significant pathway elevation.
  (B) SWAN Circos plot. Red and blue outer rings are frequency plots of gains or deletions
  and the inner ribbons represent genes within the selected pathway. Labeled gene
  symbols are enriched for CNA losses. (C) SWAN network generated, with edges represent
  protein-protein interactions. Blue nodes are enriched for loss CNAs and red nodes
  are enriched for gain CNAs. (D) Known and novel TSGs discovered by interactome analysis
  of all 31 cancer types analyzed, with those present in at least five tumor types
  displayed against z-score values. Green color indicates previously known COSMIC
  TSGs. Size is proportional to the mean z-score SWAN contribution across cancers
  with TSG-containing pathway suppression. Higher transparency indicates interacting
  protein genes influenced each gene's identification by SWAN, rather than CNAs of
  the gene itself. (E) RT-qPCR data of metallothioneins within 16q gene cluster. (F)
  Validation of shRNA-mediated knockdown of MT2A by RT-qPCR. (G) Genotoxic damage
  as measured by γH2AX immunofluorescence in the presence of 100 μM cadmium is shown
  for OVCAR3 cells and (H) in the presence of 50 μM cadmium for CAOV3 cells. (E–H)
  N = 3 experiments, with mean ± s.e.m. shown. (G, H) Scale bar is 10 μm.
