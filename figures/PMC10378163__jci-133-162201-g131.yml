figure_title: scRNA-Seq shows long-term protective effects of ruxolitinib on aGVHD
  BMSCs
caption: (A) Procedure for scRNA-Seq during long-term follow-up after ruxolitinb treatment.
  aGVHD, n = 16 per sample; R 20, n = 20 per sample; R 100, n = 10. (B) t-SNE map
  of niche cells. (C) Pearson’s correlation between the average gene expression profiles
  of samples. (D) BMSC ratio during long-term follow-up after ruxolitinb treatment.
  (E and F) Violin plots of expression levels of niche factor– (E) and differentiation-related
  (F) genes in BMSCs. (G) GO term enrichment of upregulated genes in ruxolitinib-treated
  aGVHD BMSCs. (H) GO term enrichment of ROS metabolic process–related pathway. (I)
  Common features of BMSCs among samples at different time points. (J and K) Procedure
  (J) and survival (K) after intratibial BMSC injection (cultured BMSCs, pretreated
  with vehicle or ruxolitinib); n = 10 per group. ***P < 0.001, by Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test (E and F) and log-rank test (K). R 20, day 20 after transplantation (12 hours
  after ruxolitinib treatment); R 100, day 100 after transplantation (day 80 after
  ruxolitinib treatment).
