caption: 'The expression of Wnt signaling marker proteins was affected by SOST in
  vivo. (A) The expression of Wnt signaling marker genes was detected by qRT-PCR,
  including Wnt1, β-catenin, APC, and GSK3β. (B) Western blot was used to detect the
  protein expression of Wnt1, β-catenin, APC, and GSK3β. GAPDH was used as the internal
  control. (C) Immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect the expression of
  the Wnt signaling marker proteins (Bar =50 µm). Immunohistochemical staining: green
  fluorescence marks the corresponding protein and blue fluorescence marks the nucleus.
  The data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, SOST-overexpression group vs.
  model group; **P<0.01, SOST-overexpression group vs. model group; ##P<0.01, sh-SOST
  group vs. model group. SOST, sclerostin; sh, short hairpin; APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; SD, standard deviation.'
