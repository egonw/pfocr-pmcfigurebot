caption: Comparison of temporal expression profiles between AT and PAT group during
  the development of tHO. (a,b) Temporal patterns of tHO development proteome from
  AT and PAT groups were determined by Fuzzy c-means clustering analysis. Membership
  scores indicate the degree of relationship between proteins and each cluster. The
  number of proteins belonging to each cluster is indicated in the table below. (c)
  Canonical pathway analysis ​of ​the proteins in each fuzzy c-means cluster using
  IPA. Bolded terms indicate pathways that were strongly enriched and/or strongly
  contrasted between AT and PAT group. (d) Table of proteins in canonical signaling
  pathways of tHO found to be differentially expressed between AT and PAT group.

  proteins and reveals potential mechanisms of traumatic heterotopic ossification
  progression.
