caption: 'Effects of DEAC (a), CM (b), and AMB (c) on iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated
  BV-2 cells. Cells were pretreated with DEAC (100 μg/mL), CM (50 and 100 μg/mL),
  or AMB (25 μg/mL) for 1 h and incubated with LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for additional 24 h.
  Two-way ANOVA in graphs (a) and (c), and one-way ANOVA for graph (b), followed by
  Bonferroni posttest. #p < 0.05 vs. negative control (0.1% DMSO, drug vehicle), ∗∗p
  < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. LPS group, n = 4/group.'
