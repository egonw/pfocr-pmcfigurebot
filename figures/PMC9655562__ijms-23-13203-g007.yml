caption: RNA sequencing analysis of LentiBRCT and Lentiluc HEK293T infected cells.
  Heatmap of the 192 dysregulated genes in lentiBRCT (BRCT) infected HEK293T cells
  compared to lentiluc (LUC) infected cells. The experiment was performed in triplicate
  (A). Molecular categories from Ingenuity pathway Analysis of the 192 dysregulated
  genes in lentiBRCT infected HEK293T cells compared to lentiluc infected cells. The
  graph presents the molecular categories ordered by â€“log (p value) and the number
  of genes from our list of 192 dysregulated that are in each specific category (in
  the right part of the bars) (B).
