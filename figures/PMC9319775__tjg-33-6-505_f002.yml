caption: The effect of crocin on the histopathological features of liver. (A) Representative
  microscopic images of liver sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Black and
  yellow arrows represent macro- and micro-vesicular lipid droplets respectively.
  Red arrows represent inflammatory infiltration. (B) Immunohistochemical staining
  specific for Fas receptor. Positive hepatocytes for Fas were detected mainly stained
  on the cell surface. (C) Oil Red O staining for lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes.
  Black arrows represent deposition of lipid. (D) The effect of crocin on NAS score
  with hematoxylin and eosin staining using the semi-quantitative NAS System. Data
  are analyzed as mean rank of hepatic histopathological scores in different groups.
  Ctrl, control; Cr, crocin; NAS, NAFLD activity scoring.
