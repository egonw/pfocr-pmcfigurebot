caption: 'E2F1 transcriptional regulation of RACGAP1 increase. (A) RACGAP1 transcription
  factor was predicted by the sequence 2000 kb upstream of the transcription initiation
  site of RACGAP1 in UCSC-PROMO that intersected with the transcription factor sites
  predicted by GENEGARD. (B) GSEA was used to show that high RACGAP1 expression was
  enriched in the downstream pathway of E2F1. (C) Kaplan-Meier curves showed that
  high expression of E2F1 predicted shorter RFS in TCGA-PRAD (n=437). (D-F) mRNA levels
  of E2F1 in prostate cancer datasets downloaded from TCGA-PRAD were related to different
  clinicopathological parameters: pathological T stage (n=490), pathological N stage
  (n=424), and Gleason score (n=497). (G) Patient-derived xenograft model of terminally
  differentiated NEPC (LTL331R) showed that E2F1 was significantly overexpressed (GSE59986).
  (H, I) RNA and protein levels of E2F1 and RACGAP1 in PC3 cells transiently transfected
  with E2F1 si1, si2, or vector, as determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. (J) Relative
  activity of RACGAP1-luciferase (Luc) reporter 48 h after transient transfection
  of PC3 cells with an E2F1 overexpression plasmid for 24 h compared with control
  cells. The error bars represent the means ± SD of three independent experiments.
  (K) Full nucleotide sequence of the human RACGAP1 promoter region. P1 and P2 show
  the regions of the RACGAP1 promoter explored by the paired primers (left panel).
  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that E2F1 bound at the P1 and P2 loci
  in PC3 cells (right panel). The error bars represent the means ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Bar graphs show the statistical analysis of three independent experiments.
  ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05, p = ns (no significance); t test for
  two groups or ANOVA for more than two groups.'
