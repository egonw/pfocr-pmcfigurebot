caption: Thromboelastometric findings revealed a significant increase in MCF in extem,
  intem and fibtem, while platelet MCF decreased; CFT decreased in extem and intem.
  (A) The thromboelastometric data were collected using a ROTEM® delta device. Blood
  was drawn on arrival in the emergency room (0), after 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, as well
  as after 5, 7 and 10 days. The maximum clot firmness (MCF) on the extem panel, representing
  the coagulation function in the extrinsic coagulation pathway, increased significantly
  over the first 10 days after trauma (B = 2.079, SE = 0.3016, 95% CI [1.488, 2.670],
  p < 0.001). (B) The same applies to the intem panel, representing the coagulation
  function in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, (B = 2.458, SE = 0.1717, 95% CI [2.121,
  2.794], p < 0.001), and (C) the fibtem panel, representing the extrinsic coagulation
  pathway without the contribution of platelets, as these are inhibited by cytochalasin
  D, (B = 3.441, SE = 0.1761, 95% CI [0.072, 0.093], p < 0.001). (D) The platelet
  MCF, however, represented by the subtraction between extem MCF and fibtem MCF, decreased
  over time (B = −1.153, SE = 0.2243, 95% CI [-1.593; -0.714]), p < 0.001), which
  is indicative of a platelet dysfunction. As the clot gets firmer over time, it also
  forms faster. (E) The clot formation time (CFT) decreases in both extrinsic (B =
  −9.858, SE = 3.0001, 95% CI [−15.738; −3.987], p = 0.001), and (F) intrinsic coagulation
  pathways (B = −9.361, SE = 3.2470, 95% CI [−15.725; −2.997], p < 0.01). The regression
  line shown here is for illustrative purposes.
