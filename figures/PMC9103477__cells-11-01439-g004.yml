caption: Activation of the mineralocorticoid pathway upon different stimulations.
  CYP11B2 gene expression upon AngII (A), ACTH (B) and KCl (C) per cell line as well
  as AT1R expression upon AngII stimulation (D). Scatter dot representation of the
  fold change of the current densities versus baseline at 80 mV for 5 min (300 s)
  of AngII stimulation cumulatively for all cells per time point aiming to divide
  the responders (>2 fold change, marked with red) from the non-responders (E). Representation
  of the fold change of the currents of the responder cells in conjunction with time
  for the AngII stimulation (F). Scatter dot representation of the fold change of
  the current densities versus baseline at 80 mV for 5 min (300 s) of ACTH stimulation
  cumulatively for all cells per time point aiming to divide the responders (>2 fold
  change, marked with red) from the non-responders (G). Representation of the fold
  change of the currents of the responder cells in conjunction with time for the ACTH
  stimulation (H). Scatter dot representation of the fold change of the current densities
  versus baseline at 80 mV for 5 min (300 s) of FSK stimulation cumulatively for all
  cells per time point aiming to divide the responders (>2 fold change, marked with
  red) from the non-responders (I). Representation of the fold change of the currents
  of the responder cells in conjunction with time for the FSK stimulation (J). Stars
  represent significance vs. untreated cells (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
