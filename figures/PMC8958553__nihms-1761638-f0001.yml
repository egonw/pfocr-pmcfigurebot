figure_title: AKI and CKD affect FGF23 via inflammatory, iron deficiency, anemia,
  and metabolic related pathways
caption: Downstream molecular targets are listed below each pathway. Arrows depict
  the effect of different pathways on FGF23 and dashed arrows show the feedback effect
  of FGF23. AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; IL-1, interleukin
  1; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; IL-6, interleukin 6; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; ERRg, estrogen-related receptor g; TNFa, tumor
  necrosis factor a; TGFβ, transforming factor β; NFκB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; Orai1, calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1;
  SOCE, store-operated calcium entry; LCN2, lipocalin 2; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; XLaS, extra-large G-protein subunit a; PKC, protein
  kinase C; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin
  kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; FOXO1, forkhead box protein O1; Phos,
  phosphate.
