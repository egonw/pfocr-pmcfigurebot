caption: The LrS induces unique temporal transcriptional profiles in THP-1 human monocytes
  distinct from L-LA controls. (A) Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering analysis
  of global gene expression patterns in THP-1 human monocytes conditioned with the
  LrS or LA-matched controls for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h (n = 4; p < 0.05; fold change
  different > 1.5 vs. media-control treated cells). (B) Total number of up- and down-regulated
  genes in response to each of the different challenges. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) revealed the enrichment of key macrophage signaling pathways activated by
  conditioning with the LrS (red) when compared to LA-matched controls (blue) as determined
  by the ranked t-test list metric over all tested time points. The green line represents
  the enrichment score and the black lines indicate where the genes within the gene
  set fall within the ranked pathway gene list.
