caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome mediated pyroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis
  of EAE (A) Identification of Nlrp3 knockout (KO) mice. (B) Clinical behavioral scores
  and the area under the curve (AUC). (C) H&E staining was performed on paraffin-embedded
  mouse spinal cord sections (scale bars: 100 μm). (D) LFB staining was performed
  on paraffin-embedded mouse spinal cord sections (The arrows present myelin injury
  and loss, scale bars:50 μm). (E) Immunofluorescence staining of MBP in the spinal
  cord (The arrows present myelin injury and loss, scale bars:100 μm). (F) Evaluation
  of MBP protein expression in spinal cord by western blotting. (G–J) Serum inflammatory
  factor levels of IL-8 (G), IL-6 (H), TNF-α (I), and IL-10 (J) are detected using
  ELISA. (K) Caspase-1 activity in mouse spinal cord was detected using the kit. (L)
  The protein levels of pyroptosis markers assessed using western blotting in spinal
  cord tissue. (M) Detection of NLRP3 and ASC complex formation in spinal cord by
  co-immunoprecipitation. (N) Representative image of co-localized NLRP3 and ASC with
  immunofluorescence staining in spinal cord tissue (scale bars: 50 μm). Paraffin
  sections of spinal cord tissue used for immunofluorescence staining. Data are shown
  as means ± SD (n = 6 per group). “-” for “Nlrp3−/−” represents wild type mice and
  “+” for “Nlrp3−/−” represents Nlrp3 knockout mice. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.* vs. WT group; # vs. WT + MOG group.'
