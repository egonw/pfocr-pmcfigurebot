caption: Mechanism NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neutrophils. (A). Canonical NLRP3
  inflammasome activation in neutrophils. Extracellular bacteria are mainly sensed
  by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and, in some cases, TLR4, Nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) or formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), leading
  to efficient priming. This first step can also be mediated indirectly by host factors
  such as TNF and TNFR engagement. The main NLRP3 inflammasome activation signals
  are dependent of bacterial toxins from Escherichia coli (e.g., α-hemolysin), Staphylococcus
  aureus (e.g., enterotoxin O), Streptococcus agalactiae (e.g., β-hemolysin), and
  Streptococcus aureus (e.g., pneumolysin). The damages they cause to the neutrophil
  lead to increased potassium (K+) efflux, extracellular ATP, and subsequent NLRP3
  inflammasome assembly via P2X receptor 7 (P2X7R). (B). Non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation in neutrophils. The non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in
  response to Gram-negative bacteria (Burkholderia thailandensis) or filamentous fungi
  Aspergillus fumigatus. This triggers caspase-11 activation and then NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. In response to A. fumigatus this pathway depends on Dectin-1, spleen
  tyrosine kinase (SYK), and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. (C). Neutrophil-specific
  resistance to pyroptosis. Neutrophils are resistant to pyroptosis likely because
  they produce low ASC, caspase-1, and sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1)
  proteins as compared with macrophages. Indeed, SARM1 seems to be a key regulator
  of the rate of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation at the plasma membrane to mediate
  pyroptosis. Thus, low SARM1 production by neutrophils may lead to decreased cell
  lysis.
