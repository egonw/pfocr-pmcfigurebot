caption: Identification and functional characterization of the differentially expressed
  genes at 8 days. A GO enrichment of pitaya infected with N. dimidiatum. B KEGG enrichment
  of pitaya infected with N. dimidiatum. C Heatmap analysis of plant-pathogen interaction
  genes when pitaya was infected with N. dimidiatum at different stages. D Expression
  profile and KEGG pathway analysis of ethylene and jasmonic acid-related genes involved
  in pathogen defense. (The KEGG pathway that the image comes from MAPK signaling
  pathway—plant (ko04016). Permission to use and adapt this image has been granted
  by Kanehisa Laboratories.)

  reveals the mechanisms of immune response associated with defense regulators and
  metabolic pathways.
