caption: The bubble map of urinary metabolic pathways in all mice. (a) AD and CK groups;
  (b) AD and XANL groups; (c) AD and ETH groups; (d) AD and PET groups. A is the citrate
  cycle; B is the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; C is the glutathione metabolism;
  D is the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; E is the pentose and glucuronate interconversions;
  F is the primary bile acid biosynthesis; G is the pentosephosphate pathway.
