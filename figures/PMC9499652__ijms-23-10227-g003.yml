caption: (a) Representative figures of SIRT1, p53, p21 and E2F1 immunohistochemical
  staining of liver tissues. Immunohistochemical reactions were interpreted compared
  to animals injected with both metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines, in addition
  to tumor-free animals. Arrows represent target protein expression for each protein
  in infiltrated cells, and arrowheads represent Kupffer cells. Scale bar represents
  100 μm. (b) Graphs demonstrate the results of Image J analysis for each protein
  in liver tissues (* p ˂ 0.05). (c) Representative images of FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4
  and cleaved caspase 3 protein immunohistochemical staining of liver tissues. Arrows
  represent target protein expression for each protein in infiltrated cells. Scale
  bar represents 100 μm. (d) Graphs show the results of Image J analysis for each
  protein in liver tissues (* p ˂ 0.05).
