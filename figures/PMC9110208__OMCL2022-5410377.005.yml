caption: 'OG upregulates Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in bone tissue of SAMP6 mice and osteoclast
  derived from RAW264.7 cells. (a, b) Representative Western blot analysis and the
  quantification of Nrf2 and Keap1 expression in bone tissue of mice and osteoclast;
  (c) immunofluorescence analysis for nucleus translocation of Nrf2. Scale bars: 10 μm.
  Each point represents mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the indicated
