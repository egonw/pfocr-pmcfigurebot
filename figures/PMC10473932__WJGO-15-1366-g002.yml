caption: 'The relative expression of LINC01268 in gastric cancer tissues was compared
  according to the clinicopathological characteristics. A: The expression level of
  LINC01268 in the lymph node metastasis group N1-3 (n = 52 cases) of gastric cancer
  (GC) tissue was significantly higher than that in the N0 group (n = 10 cases) (N1-3:
  One or more lymph node metastases, N0: No lymph node metastasis); B: The expression
  level of LINC01268 in the III/IV group (n = 50 cases) of GC tissues was significantly
  higher than that in the I/II group (n = 12 cases). Expression levels were normalized
  to the ACTB levels. The results were shown as the mean Â± SD. aP < 0.05, dP < 0.0001.'
