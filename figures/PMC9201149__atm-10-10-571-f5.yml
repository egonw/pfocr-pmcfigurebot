caption: 'Effect of miR-145-5p/MMP2 axis on the biological behavior of thrombin-treated
  hBMECs. (A) CCK8 assay of the proliferation of transfected hBMECs in each group;
  (B) flow cytometry to detect apoptosis of hBMECs in each group; (C) apoptosis-related
  proteins Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved-caspase 3 determined by Western blot; (D) matrigel
  assay was used to assess the formation of capillary-like structures in hBMECs (400×
  magnification); (E) expression of ZO-1 and occludin was determined by immunofluorescence
  (400× magnification, scale bar: 50 µm); (F) vascular permeability was evaluated
  using FITC-labeled dextran. (G) Protein expression levels of MMP2, Wnt3, Wnt5a,
  β-catenin, TCF-4, LEF-1 and IL-8 in the 4 experimental groups. Results are presented
  as mean ± SD. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. hBMECs, human brain microvascular endothelial
  cells; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; NC, negative control;
  SD, standard deviation; HICH, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; ZO-1, zonula occludens 1; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MMP2,
  matrix metallopeptidase 2; TCF-4, transcription factor 4; LEF-1, lymphoid enhancer
  binding factor 1; IL-8, interleukin-8.'
