caption: 'FTO upregulation in various human cancers and its molecular implications
  as an m6A demethylase, indicated by the regulation of different targets and affected
  signaling pathways. (A) FTO upregulation in AML modulates ASB2/RARA levels, hence,
  promoting AML cellular viability and proliferation. FTO inhibition via FB23-2 inhibits
  AML progression, by upregulating ASB2/RARA and downregulating MYC/CEBPA. (B) Given
  FTO’s tumorigenic role in glioblastoma, its inhibition via MA2 suppresses GSCs self-renewal
  and tumorigenesis. Additionally, inhibiting FTO using R-2HG exerts anti-tumor functions
  in lethal glioma and leukemia by modulating MYC/CEBPA levels. (C) FTO upregulation
  in CSCC induces chemo-radiotherapy resistance by increasing β-catenin and activating
  the ERCC1 pathway. E2F1/MYC are also upregulated targets in CSCC that promote oncogenic
  functions. (D) FTO overexpression in lung cancer upregulates MZF1 and USP7 levels
  via modulating their m6A levels. Thus, promoting lung cancer cells’ proliferation,
  invasion, and colony formation, while inhibiting their apoptosis. (E) In breast
  cancer cells, FTO upregulation demethylates BNIP3 as a downstream target and downregulates
  it in a YTHDF2-independent manner, and promoting oncogenic roles like metastasis.
  (F) In melanoma, upregulated FTO and reduced m6A levels, stabilize melanoma-promoting
  genes namely, PDCD1, CXCR4, and SOX10 in a YTHDF2-mediated process. Consequently,
  increasing melanoma migration, proliferation, and immunotherapy resistance. (G)
  In endometrial carcinoma, higher HOXB13 expression activates Wnt signaling and promotes
  metastasis. (H) In pancreatic cancer, FTO overexpression leads to upregulating c-MYC
  oncogene and enhancing pancreatic cancer proliferation. FTO’s additional role as
  a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer is discussed in the text. Abbreviations:
