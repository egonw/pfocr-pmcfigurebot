caption: Multiple signaling pathways are involved in the migration of VW-S/PCs. Under
  physiological conditions, VW-S/PCs reside in the microenvironment “stem cell niche.”
  In vascular diseases, inflammatory factors, cytokines, and chemokines are released
  by activated VW-S/PCs. IL-10 affects intracellular expression of related genes through
  JAK-STAT pathway, and SOCS is a specific inhibitor of the pathway. Vascular Sca-1+
  cell migration can be induced by SMC-derived chemokine CCR2 and CXCR2 through the
  CCR2/Rac1/P38 and CXCR2/Rac1/P38 signaling pathways. Extracellular matrix (ECM)
  induces phenotypic transformation and cytoskeletal changes and affects the intracellular
  pH balance, providing a potential target for vascular diseases.
