caption: The protein expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, VEGF, COX-2, angiogenin-1
  and HIF-1α in HaCaT cell of each group were detected by Western blot. (A) The expression
  bands of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, VEGF, COX-2, angiogenin-1 and HIF-1α proteins in
  blank control, negative control (adding azelaic acid), IL-17 and IL-17+ azelaic
  acid groups were detected by Western blotting; (B) the relative expression levels
  of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, VEGF, COX-2, angiogenin-1 and HIF-1α proteins in blank
  control, negative control (adding azelaic acid), IL-17 and IL-17+ azelaic acid groups.
  **P < 0.01; ns represents no statistical significance.
