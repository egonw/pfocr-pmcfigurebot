caption: LINC00092 influenced BC cell glycolysis and oxidative response. (a) GSEA
  was carried out to explore the enrichment of glycolysis and response to oxidative
  stress regulated by LINC00092 in BC tissues. (b, c) Following LINC00092 or sh-LINC00092
  transfection, cell lactate production and glucose consumption were tested via lactate
  assay kit and glucose assay kit. N = 3. (d, e) Following sh-LINC00092 transfection
  and/or 2-DG treatment, cell viabilities and proliferation were detected via CCK-8
  assay and colony formation assay. N = 3. (f) Following LINC00092 or sh-LINC00092
  transfection, the SOD, MDA, and ROS levels in cells were tested, respectively. N
  = 3. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
