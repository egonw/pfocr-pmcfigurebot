caption: ATR inhibition by VE-822 decreased liposarcoma cell proliferation. (A, B)
  VE-822, at the indicated concentrations, inhibited liposarcoma cell lines 94T778
  (A) and SW872 (B) cell proliferation, determined by MTT assay. The data represent
  the mean ± SE of 2 experiments carried out in triplicate. (C) Microscopy images
  of morphologic changes and a reduction in cell number after 72 h of VE-822 treatment.
  (D and E) The expression of respective proteins ATR, p-ATR, p-CHK1, and γ-H2AX in
  the ATR-associated signaling pathway was measured by Western blotting in the liposarcoma
  cell lines 94T778 (D), and SW872 (E) after 72 h of VE-822 treatment. (F and G) Semiquantitative
  analysis of (D) and (E) by densitometry relative to tubulin. The data are mean ±
  SE of the experiment carried out in triplicate.
