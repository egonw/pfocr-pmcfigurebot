caption: Ddx3x knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of DDX3X both exacerbated
  Dox‐induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. “+” symbol denotes presence and “−” symbol
  denotes absence of the corresponding treatment condition. (A) The RT‐qPCR analysis
  assessed the efficiency of Ddx3x knockdown. Data are presented as means ± SEM. ***p < 0.001.
  (B) The protein level of DDX3X, Casp‐3 and cleaved Casp‐3 in H9c2 cells treated
  with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection. Data are presented as means ± SEM.
  ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. (C)
  Flow cytometric analysis detected the apoptosis ratio of H9c2 cardiomyocytes treated
  with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection. The data are presented as means ± SEM.
  ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; **p < 0.01. (D) Mito‐Tracker Red CMXRos
  and Hoechst 33342 staining were detected respectively mitochondrial morphology and
  nuclear condensation of H9c2 cardiomyocytes treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x
  siRNA transfection. Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) The CCK‐8 assay was used to detect cell
  viability of H9C2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; *p < 0.05;
  ***p < 0.001. (F) The protein level of DDX3X, Casp‐3 and cleaved Casp‐3 in H9c2
  cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following RK‐33 pretreatment. Data are presented as
  means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
  (G) Mito‐Tracker Red CMXRos and Hoechst 33342 staining were detected respectively
  mitochondrial morphology and nuclear condensation of H9c2 cells treated with Dox
  (2 μM) following RK‐33 pretreatment. Scale bar = 50 μm
