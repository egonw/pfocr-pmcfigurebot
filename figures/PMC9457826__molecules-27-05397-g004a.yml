caption: Activated myogenesis by pinoresinol and vanillic acid in mouse myoblast cell
  line. Western blot using C2C12 cells subjected to different concentrations of pinoresinol
  (A) or vanillic acid (C) to assess TGF-β signaling (p-Smad2/3 and Smad 4), IGF-1
  signaling (p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-4E-BP1), MyoD, and myogenin. β-Actin was
  used as the loading control. The relative band intensity of proteins to that of
  β-actin is expressed as the fold change compared to the control (no treatment) for
  pinoresinol (B) or vanillic acid (D). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, obtained
  from at least triplicate determinations. * and *** indicate p < 0.05 and p < 0.001
  by one-way ANOVA, respectively.
