caption: 'Perfluorocarbons deliver oxygen to hypoxia areas. (A) Representative PO2
  vs time data for MACF initially saturated with oxygen (+O2) and MAC + O2 at RT.
  (B) Oxygen transport rate measurements. Superscript symbols “*” indicate p < 0.0001.
  (C) Arginine and proline metabolism pathway supplies fibrillary collagen synthesis.
