figure_title: ARID3A regulates the expression of stem cell population maintenance
  genes
caption: 'A Association between the enrichment of ES signature genes and ARID3A expression
  in HCC tumours from patients in the TCGA-LIHC cohort, as determined by GSEA. B GSEA
  of the ES signature gene set in RNA-seq data from Huh7 cells overexpressing ARID3A
  (vs. control vector cells). C Left: Correlation patterns between the expression
  of ARID3A and the subsets of ES signature genes. Right: mRNA expression levels of
  ES signature gene sets in ARID3A-overexpressing Huh7 cells. D Overlap of genomic
  loci corresponding to ARID3A CUT&Tag data in Huh7 cells and ARID3A ChIP-seq data
  in HepG2 cells (ENCODE: ENCSR000EDP). E GO term enrichment analysis of stemness-associated
  genes related to the overlapping loci in Fig. 3D. F, G GSEA of the stem cell population
  maintenance pathway in ARID3A-overexpressing Huh7 cells (vs. control, vector-overexpressing
  cells) (F) and Huh7 cell tumourspheres (vs. 2D cultured cells) (G). Hâ€“M Profiles
  of ARID3A, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 occupancy at the promoter regions of the
  indicated genes.'
