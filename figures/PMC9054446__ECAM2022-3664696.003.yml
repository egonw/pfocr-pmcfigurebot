caption: 'ALR and PALR affect the cell cycle of HMCs. HMCs were stained with PI for
  flow cytometry analysis. (a) Representative images of cell cycle. (b-c) The rate
  of G0/G1 phage, S phage, and M phage (%). (d-f) The protein expressions of CKD2,
  Cyclin E, and p27 were analyzed using western blot. The statistical data of the
  proteins were analyzed with Image J 1.8.0 software. Data were expressed as mean ± SD
  (n = 3; #P < 0.05,##P < 0.01 or @@P < 0.01 versus control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01 or ▲▲P < 0.01versus LPS group).'
