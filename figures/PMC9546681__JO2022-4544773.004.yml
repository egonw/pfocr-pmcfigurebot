caption: The receptor of NK cell analysis in TCGA dataset and paired WT samples. The
  gene expression level of activating receptor, inhibitory receptor, and cytokine
  receptor in NK cells of WT and adjacent kidney in TCGA-WT datasets (a–c). qRT-PCR
  analyzes the gene expression level of the NKG2D, LAG3 IL-15R, and GGT1 in paired
  WT sample, respectively (d–g). Quantification analysis of NKG2D protein expression
  level was performed by Western blot in paired WT sample (h, i). N and T represent
  nontumor adjacent kidney and WT, respectively. Results are shown as mean ± SD. For
  comparisons, Student's t-test was performed in two group, or one-way analysis of
  variance (ANOVA) was performed in multiple groups. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p <
  0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
