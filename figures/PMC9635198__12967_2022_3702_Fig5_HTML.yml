caption: Circle plot and expression level of IFNG signaling pathway A. Circle plot
  of IFNG signaling in the pre-treatment group, similar to Fig.  A‒C. The edge width
  corresponds to the strength of the ligand-receptor pairsB. Violin plot of IFNG expression
  levels. The horizontal line indicates the average in each group, and the asterisks
  denote the significance of the difference between groups calculated using the Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001 (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****),
  p ≥ 0.05 (ns)C. Proportion of IFNG+ NK cells in the healthy, pre- and post-treatment
  groupsD. Average expression of cytokines including IL1, IL12, IL23, and TNF-α in
  dendritic cells by condition and IFNG receptor expression. The horizontal line indicates
  the average in each group, and asterisks denote the significance of the difference
  between groups calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01
  (**), p ≤ 0.001 (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****), p ≥ 0.05 (ns)
