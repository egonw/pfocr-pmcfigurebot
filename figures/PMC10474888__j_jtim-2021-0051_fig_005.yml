caption: 'TP activates mTOR signaling pathway in cultured TM3 cells. Western blot
  analysis was used to detect the proteins expression.A: Expression of p-mTOR, mTOR
  protein following treatment with TP (50, 100, 200 nmol/L for 24 h.B-C: Bar graphs
  were representative of three independent expriments.D: Exrpession of p-p70s6k, p70s6k,
  p-4EBP1,and 4EBP1 protein following treatment with TP (50, 100, 200 nmol/L for 24
  h.E-G: Bar graphs were representative of three independent expriments. Data were
  shown as mean±SD. (**P ﹤ 0.05 vs. control group, n = 3). TP: triptolide.'
