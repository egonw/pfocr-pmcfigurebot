figure_title: Integration of mechanotransduction pathways and innate immune cell activation
caption: Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) stimulation accompanied by mechanical
  force causes PIEZO1 co-localization with some Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Force-triggered
  opening of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) and PIEZO1 leads
  to Ca2+ influx. Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels induce actin polymerization and activate
  Rho GTPase, boosting phagocytosis. Concurrently, F-actin formation depletes G-actin
  availability, and without G-actin to bind to, myocardin-related transcription factor
  A (MRTFA) is shuttled into the nucleus where it forms a complex with serum response
  factor (SRF). MRTFA–SRF enables transcription of immune effector genes, such as
  those encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CXC-chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), generally
  skewing the cell towards an enhanced inflammatory phenotype. Ca2+ also enforces
  TLR signalling by promoting the expression and activation of endothelin 1 (EDN1)
  and NF-κB. EDN1 stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), promoting TLR-induced
  HIF1α accumulation. Active NF-κB and HIF1α translocate to the nucleus and drive
  metabolic and inflammatory gene expression. Additionally, TRPV4-dependent Ca2+ influx
  prompts dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) to activate p38 and inhibit JNK activity,
  further enhancing phagocytosis. The mechanosensitive molecules yes-associated protein
  (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) also translocate
  to the nucleus upon activation, bind TEA domains (TEADs) and induce transcription
  of genes that boost glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. This immunometabolic regulation through multiple mechanosensitive
  inputs mediates robust cell proliferation and increases the production of inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). PIEZO1 also
  activates histone deacetylases (HDACs) to further induce inflammatory cytokine output.
  Dashed lines represent pathways where there are still major gaps in understanding
  the transduction mechanisms, and solid lines depict more well-described pathways.
  Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex modulation of immune activation
  has been shown in adaptive cells only, but we hypothesize it also plays a role in
  innate immune cell regulation. ECM, extracellular matrix; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  TNF, tumour necrosis factor.
