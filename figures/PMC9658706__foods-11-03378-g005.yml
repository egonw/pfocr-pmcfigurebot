caption: Effects of apo-LF and LPS alone or in combination on inflammation related
  proteins in colonic tissue of young mice. (A) Protein extracts were immunoblotted
  to capture protein bands. (B) Quantification analysis of protein band density. C
  represents control. LF represents apo-LF. Apo-LF represents individual treatment
  with 100 mg/kg b.w. apo-LF, LPS represents individual treatment with 10 mg/kg b.w.
  LPS, LPS + apo-LF represents combined treatment with of 10 mg/kg b.w. LPS and 100
  mg/kg b.w. apo-LF. Data analyzed were presented as means ± SD. * means comparison
  with the control group, * p < 0.05.
