caption: 'Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in VPS13CKOcells is dependent on increased
  cytosolic mtDNA. (A) qPCR of three ISG transcripts shows that depletion of mtDNA
  with EtBr reduces ISG levels in VPS13CKO cells to or near WT levels. n = 3 biological
  replicates. (B) p-TBK1 and p-STING are reduced in EtBr-treated VPS13CKO cells. (C)
  Levels of three mtDNA amplicons (ND1, D-Loop, and CYB) are elevated in the cytosolic
  fraction of VPS13CKO cells detected by qPCR and normalized to nuclear gene hB2M.
  n = 3 biological replicates. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P
  < 0.0001. #, P < 0.05; ##, P < 0.01; ###, P < 0.001; #### < 0.0001 in EtBr compared
  with untreated cells. Data were compared using two-sided t tests. Error bars represent
  Â±SD. Source data associated with this figure can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6416363.
