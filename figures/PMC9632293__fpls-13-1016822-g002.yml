caption: Interaction phenotypes of P. xanthii race ‘2F’ among mock and disease inoculated
  leaves of watermelon resistant and sensitive lines after 48(h). (A) Phenotypes of
  mock-inoculated (MI) and powdery mildew inoculated (PM-I) in resistant (R_CK/I)
  and susceptible (S_CK/I) cultivars of watermelon. (B) Post-invasion response and
  hyphal growth in different contrasting cultivars after post inoculations. P. xanthii
  race ‘2F’ hyphae were stained with trypan blue. (C) Bar graph depicting the number
  of PM conidials on the leaves of ZXG 1755/1996 lines on MI, PM-I, and at 5 and 9
  dpi.

  and phenylpropanoid pathway in early-stage resistance against powdery mildew in
