figure_title: SCAI prevents Polθ‐mediated MMEJ during ICL repair (related to Fig )
caption: Whole cell extracts of U2OS and U2OS/SCAI KO cells were analyzed by immunoblotting
  with indicated antibodies.Mock‐, 53BP1‐, or SCAI‐C‐depleted egg extracts were analyzed
  by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies.pICLpt was replicated in extracts immunodepleted
  in mock‐, 53BP1‐, or SCAI‐C‐depleted egg extracts digested with PsiI+XhoI and resolved
  on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.pICLpt was replicated in SCAI‐C‐depleted extracts
  that were also depleted of BRCA2, or supplemented with DNA‐PKcs inhibitor (NU7441;
  100 µM) where indicated. Reaction samples were digested with PsiI+XhoI and analyzed
  on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Mock‐ or BRCA2‐depleted egg extracts were analyzed
  by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies.Most frequent deletion products in sequencing
  data in Fig . In red, crosslinked guanines; highlighted in grey, deletions; underlines,
  microhomology regions.Schematic representation of DNA synthesis occurring across
  the adducted base following DNA incisions on either the top or bottom strand. The
  denoted nucleotide position 1,548 corresponds to the insertion 0 position when incisions
  occur in the bottom strand or to the −1 position when incisions occur in the top
  strand. Sequencing products of correct length from Fig  were analyzed for their
  nucleotide misincorporation distribution (bottom graphs). Misincorporation is based
  on the bottom strand read.Samples in Fig  were analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis.pICLpt
  was replicated in mock‐ or SCAI‐depleted extracts treated or not with Novobiocin
  (NVB; 150 µM) in the presence of [α‐32P]dATP, and reactions were analyzed by native
  agarose gel electrophoresis. RI, replication intermediates; OC, open circular; SC,
  supercoiled.Samples in (I) were digested with PsiI+XhoI or AflIII and analyzed on
  a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Clonogenic survival of U2OS and U2OS/SCAI KO cells
  treated or not with Novobiocin (NVB; 50 µM) and subjected to various doses of MMC
  for 24 h (mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).
