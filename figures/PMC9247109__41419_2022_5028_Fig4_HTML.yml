figure_title: RNA-seq analysis following DHODH inhibition in CML
caption: A The volcano plot demonstrates the number of up- and down-regulated genes
  in CML CD34+ (n:5) patients’ cells after treatment with 100 nM Meds433 for 3 days.
  B The top 100 differentially expressed genes based on adjusted p value are depicted
  in the heatmap, and C shows enriched and depleted hallmark gene sets and three enrichment
  plots related to apoptosis, P53 pathway, and MYC targets. The number in the plots
  demonstrates a normalized enrichment score (NES). D demonstrates Western blot analysis
  of JURL-MK1 cell line treated with 100 nM Meds433 for 3 days (n:3). E shows CFU
  assay after the treatment of CML CD34+ (n:5) patients’ cells with Meds433. For this
  figure, the total number of colonies (CFU-GM + CFU-E + BFU-E) and the number of
  each subset are displayed. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
