caption: 'a A Correlation between primary and secondary metabolites (phenylpropanoid
  and the predominant amino acids). Cluster analysis of metabolites involved in metabolic
  pathways is shown as a heatmap (distance measure using Pearson, and clustering algorithm
  using Ward.D). We identified five distinct clusters; 1: Lignin to Myricetin, 2:
  Ferulic acid to PLR, 3: H2O2 content to PAL, 4: SOD activity to PAL activity, 5:Glu
  to Leu. The intensity of the red and blue colorants indicates the high and low relative
  abundance of metabolites, respectively (color figure online). b H2O2 burst acts
  as a secondary messenger involved in oxidative response in L. album hairy roots
  under P. indica CDCW elicitation. There is a close relationship between H2O2 and
  the others compounds such as, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and amino acids. Also,
  the phenylpropanoid pathway starts with the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, which
  is converted to cinnamic acid by the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)'
