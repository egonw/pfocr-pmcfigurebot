caption: AAMDC overexpression compromised solanine-induced anti-gastric cancer abilities
  in vitro. (A) SGC-7901 cell proliferation evaluated by the EdU staining. (B) The
  protein levels of cleaved Caspase-3, LC3, MYC, and ATF4 were detected by the Western
  blot assay. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3).
