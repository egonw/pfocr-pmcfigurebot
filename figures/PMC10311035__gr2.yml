caption: 'Cross-functional signaling between Wnt and other signaling pathways in osteoblasts.
  Wnt and Bmp: Wnt/β-catenin signaling is stimulated by Bmp signaling activity by
  creating β-catenin/TCF/LEF/RUNX2 complex thus increasing the Wnt expression, inhibiting
  DVL and decreasing BTRC expression, oppositely Wnt signaling is inhibited when Bmp
  activates Wnt antagonist Dkk 1 and Sost expression thus preventing β-catenin translocation
  in the nucleus. Wnt and TGF-β: TGF-β stimulates Wnt ligands gene expression to increase
  and Axin protein gene expression to decrease via Wnt signaling activation. Wnt,
  BMP and FGF: FGF expression is increased by Bmp signaling and vice versa, thus indirectly
  increasing and decreasing DKK levels, respectively. The Fgf-mediated activation
  of P13K-AKT pathway or MAP kinase pathway causes the GSK-3β to phosphorylate and
  further translocate β-catenin into the nuclei while the inhibition of SNAIL phosphorylation
  hinders the E-cadherin-mediated translocation of β-catenin into the nuclei. Wnt
  and Hippo: In the nucleus, YAP forms transcriptional complexes with TEADs (Transcriptional
  enhanced associate domains), inducing downstream gene expression. Wnt and Hh: Smoothened
  (SMO) catalyzes a series of reactions in order to release glioma-associated oncogene
  (GLI) from the deactivated compound and translocate it to the nucleus to operate
  target gene expression. During the post-translational modification (PTM) phase,
  GLI and Suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) negatively regulate the Hh signaling
  and hinder β-catenin to translocate to the nuclei, while Smoothened positively promotes
  β-catenin production. Wnt and Notch: Notch proteins initiate the expression of Hes
  and Hey genes thus hindering the well-functioning of Wnt signaling and restricting
  β-catenin-mediated transcription. Wnt and PDGF: PDGF signaling pathway can stimulate
  the SMAD1/5/8/RUNX2 complex to induce gene production and guide the differentiation
  of bone.'
