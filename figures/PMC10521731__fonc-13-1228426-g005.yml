caption: Relation between ARSD and glioma immune microenvironment. (A) The levels
  of 24 immune cell types in high- and low-ARSD groups. (B) ARSD expression is correlated
  with various immune cell types. (C-E) The correlation between ARSD expression and
  infiltration of macrophages (C), neutrophils (D) and Th2 cells (E). (F) Association
  between ARSD and innate immunity, adaptive immunity and Cancer-Immunity Cycle. (G)
  A barplot was utilized to display the enrichment scores of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle
  in the high-ARSD and low-ARSD groups. * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
article_title: Arylsulfatase D is a prognostic biomarker that promotes glioma cells
  progression through JAK2/STAT3 pathway and M2 macrophage infiltration.
