caption: 'MDK regulates stem-like properties through the Notch1/p-JNK signaling pathway.
  A. western blot analysis was performed to detect MDK, ALK, P38, ERK, JNK, AKT, STAT3
  and Notch1 expression in the siMDK group compared with the control group. B. Western
  blot analysis was performed to detect MDK, JNK, and Notch1 expression between T98G-shMDK
  and LN229-shMDK cells and the control group. C. After U251 cells were treated with
  0.3 μg/mL rhMDK for 24 h, the expression of MDK, JNK, Notch1, CD133 and Nanog was
  detected by western blot analysis. D. T98G and LN229 cells were treated with the
  p-JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μM) and Notch1 inhibitor MK-0752 (200 nM) for 24 h,
  and then western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of JNK and
  Notch1. UN: untreated, NC: negative control.'
