caption: Variation in transcriptome of Dendrobium nobile at two growth stages. a,
  PCA analysis of total genes expressed in D. nobile stems at two growth stages. b,
  differentially expressed genes (FDR were < 0.5, fold change were ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5)
  at two growth stages. c, bubble plot of KEGG enrichment of the differentially expressed
  genes. The y-axis indicates pathway names, and the x-axis indicates the ratio of
  the number of genes in the pathway of the DEGs and all genes (enrich factor). The
  q-value is represented by the color of the dot. The score of enrich factor is represented
  by the size of the dot. Different colors of KEGG pathways represented different
  classes of pathways according to the secondary classification of KEGG Pathway Maps.
  DnS1, immature stems; DnS2, mature stems.
article_title: Metabolic and transcriptomic analyses elucidate a novel insight into
  the network for biosynthesis of carbohydrate and secondary metabolites in the stems
  of a medicinal orchid Dendrobium nobile.
