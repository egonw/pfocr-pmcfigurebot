caption: 'α-catenin stabilizes CEP55 to support HCC cell migration but not proliferation.
  A Western immunoblot of CEP55 in HLF cells after transfection of two gene-specific
  siRNAs (#1, #2). Samples were isolated 48 h after transfection. B Cell viability
  assay of HLF cells after siRNA-mediated silencing of CEP55 at indicated time points.
  C Proliferation of HLF cells was measured 72 h after siRNA transfection specific
  for CEP55. D Lateral migration of HLF cells after CEP55 silencing was investigated
  using a ‘scratch’ assay after 24 h. Cells were pretreated with mitomycin-C to block
  cell proliferation. E Western immunoblot after inhibition of α‐catenin by siRNAs
  in HLF cells. Samples were isolated 72 h after transfection. F Real-time PCR analysis
  of α‐catenin and CEP55 excludes the possibility of transcriptional regulation of
  CEP55 via an α‐catenin-dependent mechanism. G Lateral migration of HLF cells after
  CEP55 silencing with and without inducible expression of α‐catenin at indicated
  time points. Representative pictures of scratches are shown. H Scheme summarizing
  findings of this study. While the FoxM1/TEAD/YAP complex is required for the overexpression
  of CEP55, the interaction between α‐catenin and CEP55 is essential for the stabilization
  of CEP55. CEP55 facilitates a pro-migratory phenotype, likely via activation of
  the PI3K/AKT pathway and induction of EMT. Additional molecular mechanisms are possible
