figure_title: Schematic for the plausible mechanisms by which PI3K pathway inhibition
  mediated the anti-leukemic activity of FD268 AML cells
caption: Via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, compound FD268 diminished
  the survival and proliferative capacity of the AML cells. The suppression of PI3K
  induced apoptotic cell death through upregulation of proapoptotic protein Bad and
  downregulation of antiapoptotic Mcl-1, and induced mitochondrial dependent cell
  apoptosis by activation of the caspase-3.

  and induces apoptosis via inhibiting PI3K pathway in acute myeloid leukemia.
