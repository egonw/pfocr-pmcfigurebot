caption: 'The effects of VD on the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in the hippocampal
  tissue of rats. (a–d) Representative Western blots and densitometric quantification
  of hippocampal expression of TLR4, MyD88, nuclear NF-κB p65, and cytoplasmic NF-κB
  p65 protein at 3 d post-TBI in rats. The data are represented as mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 compared with the sham group, #P < 0.05
  compared with the TBI group.'
