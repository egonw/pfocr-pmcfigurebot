caption: Computational model of the heteromeric TM4/5 CB2R-OX1R interface. (A,B) The
  possible modulation (indicated by the black arrows) of an antagonist to a neighbor
  receptor through a network of aromatic residues connecting both orthosteric sites,
  viewed from the membrane. (A) the CB2R/JWH133-OX1R/SB334867 complex; The experimental
  structure of the OX1R antagonist SB334867 revealed the presence of two copies of
  the ligand in the binding pocket interacting antiparallelly with each other, which
  resulted in a large ligand volume near TM5. (B) The CB2R/SR144528-OX1R/orexin-A.
  Similarly, the CB2R antagonist SR144528 puts an aromatic ring at the region where
  most CB ligands place the alkyl chain (such as in JHW133), also towards TM5. The
  CB2R receptor is shown in gold and the OX1R receptor in blue. Small-molecule ligands
  and aromatic side chains connecting the pockets are shown as sticks; orexin-A with
  a thick green cartoon. Dotted boxes indicate TMs 4 and 5 of both receptors. In (C)
  detail of the CB2R/SR144528-OX1R/orexin-A complex viewed from the extracellular
  side superposing different orientations of the extracellular portion of TM5 and
  proximal region of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) (i) from the OX2R/orexin-B
  complex (PDB id 7L1U, cylinder and loop in light blue), which would clash sterically
  with the TM4 of the CB2R; and (ii) from the OX1R/SB334867 complex (PDB id 6TQ7,
  pink cylinder), which orients in a direction that does not directly face TM4 and
  better avoids the possible clashes with it TM4. Arrows indicate the movements of
  TM5 helices towards the TM5 modeled in the heteromer (see , dark blue) []. This
  complex shows a characteristic signaling where the OX1R selective antagonist potentiates
  the cannabinoid CB2R function in cAMP signaling while it blocks the indirect MAPK
  pathway. These interesting results are also observed in resting microglia. However,
  in activated microglia, the OX1R antagonist blockade became stronger, inducing a
  higher potentiation of CB2R cannabinoid signaling not only in cAMP but also in MAPK
  signaling. These results can be explained because in primary microglia from the
  transgenic AD model, the CB2-OX1 receptor heteromer expression is significantly
  higher than in equivalent cells from control animals, as shown by PLA. This finding
  suggests that the heteromer could be a target to combat neurodegeneration. We have
  previously shown that primary microglia from this AD model have an activated phenotype
  that is, likely, neuroprotective [,,]. This hypothesis would explain why cognitive
  deficits do not appear at birth but later in life. Future research should address
  whether the CB2-OX1 receptor heteromer is a suitable target to skew microglia to
  the neuroprotective phenotype.
