caption: Baicalein induced apoptosis by triggering ERS in GC cells. A Expression levels
  of ERS markers Grp78 and CHOP measured using Western blot; B Intracellular Ca2 + levels
  determined by Fluo-3 AM fluorescent probes; C Intercellular Ca2 + levels measured
  by flow cytometry; D Cell apoptosis detected by flow cytometry. Cell experiment
  was replicated thrice, and the data were presented as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was
  used for comparisons among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s test. **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001
