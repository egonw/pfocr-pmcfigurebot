caption: 'MWM tests and OFTs in the Sham, HIBI, HIBI+Fer‐1, and HIBI + Res groups.
  (A,B) Statistical results of total distance and average speed measured during the
  OFT (n = 8 per group). (C) Representative behavioral tracks of rats in different
  groups during the OFT. (D) Measurements of escape latency indicated that rats in
  the HIBI group exhibited poor spatial data acquisition ability, which was improved
  by Fer‐1 or Res administration in the HIBI+Fer‐1 and HIBI+Res groups, respectively
  (n = 8 per group). (E) Platform crossing times indicated that rats in the HIBI+Fer‐1
  and HIBI+Res groups exhibited better memory retention than those in the HIBI group
  (n = 8 per group). (F) Representative swimming tracks of Sham, HIBI, HIBI+Fer‐1,
  and HIBI+Res rats. Data represent the mean ± SD. ns: not significant. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 vs. the Sham group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01
  ###p < 0.001, ####p < 0.0001 vs. the HIBI group. HIBI, hypoxic–ischemic brain injury;
  Fer‐1, ferrostatin‐1; Res, resveratrol; OFT, open‐field test; MWM, Morris water
  maze; CA1, cornu ammonis 1.'
