caption: 'PFC cholinergic response to LPS of delayed cohort. Prior to LPS administration,
  there was a significant cross-over effect of PB and repeated restraint stress (RRS)
  on basal ACh levels in the PFC (inset). Rats with a history of PB treatment exhibited
  an attenuated cholinergic response to LPS at collection 12 compared to vehicle non-stressed
  controls (Vehicle-NSC). In rats with a history of PB and RRS, the cholinergic response
  to LPS was significantly greater at collections 5, 7, 9, 12, 13 and 16 than PB-NSC
  rats. Rats with a history of PB and RRS also exhibited exaggerated cholinergic responses
  to LPS compared to Vehicle-RRS rats with a significant increase at collection 16
  and non-significant increases at collections 7, 9 and 13. All data are expressed
  as mean + SEM, n = 6–8. [*: Significant effect of PB in NSC rats, p < 0.05. $: Significant
  effect of RRS in PB-treated rats, p < 0.05. &: Significant effect of PB treatment
  in rats with a history of RRS, p < 0.05. %: Significant cross-over effect of PB
  and RRS, p < 0.05].'
