caption: (A and B) Signaling pathway analysis by KEGG and (D and E) functional terms
  by GO enrichment analysis in patients with advanced NSCLC (A and D) with and (B
  and E) without BM. The value represents the number of mutated genes enriched in
  these functional terms. Venn diagram of (C) signaling pathways or (F) functional
  terms in the BM group and the non-BM group. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes; GO, Gene Ontology; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; BM, brain metastases.

  and non-brain metastases in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
