caption: GRIK3 was down-regulated in NSCLC. A. The expression of GRIK3 in 515 NSCLC
  tissues and 59 para-carcinoma tissues from the TCGA database. B. The expression
  of GRIK3 in 59 para-carcinoma tissues and 515 NSCLC tissues (277 stage I, 125 stage
  II, 85 stage III and 28 stage IV). C. The overall survival of NSCLC patients who
  were divided into high GRIK3 (n=252) and low GRIK3 (n=253) groups was analyzed using
  the TCGA database. D. The immunohistochemistry of GRIK3 in NSCLC tissues from recurrent
  (n=15) and non-recurrent (n=15) patients. The scale bar was 50 Î¼m. The expression
  intensity of GRIK3 was calculated. E. The relative cell proliferation of the vector
  cells and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3 overexpression. F. The colony formation
  capability of vector cells and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3 overexpression.
