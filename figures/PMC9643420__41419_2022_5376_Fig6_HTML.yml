figure_title: HNRNPU activates the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  by regulating MCM10 and LMO4
caption: A Western blot analysis of endogenous HNRNPU knockout MCF10 CA1a cells stably
  expressing exogenous MCM10-FLAG. B Cell proliferation assays of the cells described
  in Fig. 6A. C–E Colony formation assays and Transwell assays of the cells described
  in Fig. 6A. Representative images (C) and quantitative results (D, E) are shown.
  F MCF10 CA1a cells were transfected with two different shRNAs targeting LMO4 (LMO4-sh1,
  LMO4-sh2) or negative control shRNA (Ctrl-sh). Cells were analysed by immunoblotting
  after 48 h of transfection. G Cell proliferation assays of the cells described in
  Fig. 6F. H, I Colony formation assays and Transwell assays of the cells described
  in Fig. 6F. Representative images (H) and quantitative results (I) are shown. Data
  were presented as the mean ± SEM. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, n.s. not
  significant. J Western blot analysis showing the levels of P-β-catenin, c-Myc, CyclinD1,
  E-cadherin, MMP-2, MMP-9, Snail and Slug when the expression of MCM10 was decreased.
  K Western blot analysis showing the levels of MCM10, P-β-catenin, c-Myc, CyclinD1,
  E-cadherin, MMP-2, MMP-9, Snail and Slug when the expression of HNRNPU was decreased.
  L Western blot analysis shows the levels of P-PI3K, PI3K, P-akt, Akt, P-mTOR and
  mTOR when the expression of LMO4 was decreased. M Western blot analysis shows the
  levels of LMO4, P-PI3K, PI3K, P-akt, Akt, P-mTOR and mTOR when the expression of
  HNRNPU was decreased.
