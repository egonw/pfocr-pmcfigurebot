caption: KEGG cluster profiles in CKD prediction and kidney function slope analyses.
  From the top, the top 20 KEGG pathways correlated with CKD prediction (left) and
  kidney function slope (right) results were listed. Dot size represents the gene
  count related to specific pathways and dot color represents adjusted p values. X-axis
  indicates the gene ratio, which was calculated by the count of the selected genes
  in this analysis/count of pathway genes.
