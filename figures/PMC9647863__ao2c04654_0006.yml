caption: Dynamic changes for volatiles derived from the MEP pathway. (a) Diagram presentation
  of monoterpene synthesis from GPP. (b) (E)-β-Ocimene and (Z)-β-ocimene content changes
  during spreading. (c) The (E)-β-ocimene-to-(Z)-β-ocimene ratio changes during spreading.
  (d) Geraniol, nerol, neral, and citral content changes during spreading. (e) Linalool
  and linalool oxide content changes during spreading. (f) α-Terpineol and α-terpinene
  content changes during spreading. (g) Phytol, phytol acetate, and neophytadiene
  content changes during spreading.
