caption: 'Baicalein inhibits inflammatory response through the PPARγ/LXRα signaling
  pathway. (A–F) THP-1 macrophages were incubated with or without 50 μg/ml ox-LDL
  for 48 h, transfected with or without siRNAs against LXRα or PPARγ for 48 h, and
  then treated with 100 μM baicalein for 24 h. (A, C–E) The mRNA levels of TNF-α,
  IL-1β, and IL-6 were determined using qRT-PCR. (B, D–F) The cell culture supernatant
  was collected and then subjected to ELISA for detecting the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β,
  and IL-6. Data are the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001
  vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. ox-LDL group; &&P < 0.01 vs. ox-LDL + baicalein
  group.'
