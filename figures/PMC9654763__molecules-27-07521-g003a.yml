caption: 'Effect of Tab on the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in BV2 cells induced
  by LPS. The cells were pretreated with Tab (3, 6, or 10 μM) for 4 h, then treated
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. The culture supernatant was collected to detect the
  production of IL-1β (A), TNF-α (B), and IL-6 (C). ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated control
  cells and *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-treated cells.'
