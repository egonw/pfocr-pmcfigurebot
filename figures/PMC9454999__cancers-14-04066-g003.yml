caption: Transcriptomic expression of hallmark Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway genes
  in CTNNB1-mutant versus non-mutant melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 monotherapy
  (A). Gene expression was measured in transcripts per million (TPM). Wilcoxon sum
  rank test was used for comparison. Spearman correlation of transcriptomic gene expression
  of CTNNB1 (y-axis) and hallmark Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway genes (B). Overall
  (C) and progression-free survival (D) in CTNNB1-mutant compared to non-mutant melanoma
  patients treated with anti-PD1 monotherapy. Survival was measured in days.
