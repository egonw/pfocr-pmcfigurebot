caption: 'Effects of Dyglomera® on expression of adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related
  proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Control group (“0 μg/mL”), only dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO) treated no differentiation control; MDI, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone,
  and insulin treated differentiation group. ## p < 0.01 vs. control group. ** p <
  0.01 vs. MDI control group. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three
  independent experiments.'
