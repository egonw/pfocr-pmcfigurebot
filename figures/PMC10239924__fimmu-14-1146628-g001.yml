caption: (A) mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40 and DEPTOR. mTOR is
  the core component of mTORC1. Raptor and mLST8 are the two other main components
  and PRAS40 DEPTOR are two inhibitory subunits of mTORC1. (B) In T cell, mTORC1 is
  sensitive to three kinds of signals including immune signals, nutrients and environmental
  cues and mTORC1 can promote translation initiation and protein synthesis by directly
  phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs).
  Raptor-mTORC1 signaling pathway play crucial roles in cell signaling, metabolism
  and autophagy.
