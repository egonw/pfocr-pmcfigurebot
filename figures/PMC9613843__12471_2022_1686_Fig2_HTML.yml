caption: Putative mechanism of DAVNNT. a ECG demonstrating DAVNNT in our patient.
  One P wave is followed by two QRS complexes. The cycle length between P waves is
  640 ms. Note that the P waves are positive in lead II ruling out a retrograde P wave;
  b Sinus beats are conducted anterogradely via the fast (dashed line) and slow (dotted
  line) pathways from the AV node. There should be a critical delay in the slow pathway
  to allow recovery of refractoriness in the His-Purkinje system following activation
  by the fast pathway. Furthermore, there is retrograde unidirectional block in both
  pathways (denoted by black dot). F fast pathway, S slow pathway
