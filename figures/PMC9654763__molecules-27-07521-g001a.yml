caption: Effect of Tab on the viability of BV2 cells. (A) The chemical structure of
  Table (B) BV2 cells were treated with 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 20 μM Tab for 24 h.
  (C) The cells were treated with 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 μM Tab for 4 h, then treated
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. The cell survival rate was determined by CCK-8. (D)
  Microglial activation was visualized by immunostaining with an anti-CD11b antibody.
  *** p < 0.001 vs. control cells.
