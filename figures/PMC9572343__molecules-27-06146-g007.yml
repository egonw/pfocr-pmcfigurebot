caption: JNK Inhibition Attenuates Dox Cytotoxicity in Breast Cancer Cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were incubated with SP6000125 (20 µM) for 1 h, then treated with Dox (0.1,1
  or 10 µM) for the indicated time. Cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE,
  and then assessed for (A) p-JNK, JNK, p-c-Jun, and c-Jun. (B) Cell viability was
  calculated and % of surviving cells was assessed using the MTT assay. (C) Caspase-3,
  c-Caspase-3, PARP, c-PARP, p-γ-H2AX, and β-Actin. Each value represents the mean
  ± S.E.M of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001
  compared with the correspondent control.
