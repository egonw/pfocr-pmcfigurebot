caption: Proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle‐related gene expression patterns
  in each cluster. (A) Heatmap analyses showing various apoptosis‐related pathway
  activities of individual clusters. (B) Gene ontology analyses of T cell proliferation,
  activation, differentiation and enrichment status of γδ T cells in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) versus healthy livers and γδ T cells in cluster 4 versus the rest
  of the clusters. (C) Pie chart showing the cell cycle stage of individual cells.
  (D) Expression patterns of cell cycle arrest and progression‐related genes of γδ
  T cells among individual clusters and between HCC and healthy livers
article_title: Hepatocellular carcinoma‐infiltrating γδ T cells are functionally defected
  and allogenic Vδ2+ γδ T cell can be a promising complement.
