caption: CXCR4 plays a critical role in DPP-4 inhibition-induced autophagy in human
  and mouse breast cancer cells. (A,B). The levels of CXCR4, p-mTOR, HIF-1α, LC3,
  and p62 were estimated by Western blot assays. Human MCF 10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231
  cells (A) and mouse 4T1 (B) cells were treated with KR62436 (KR, 50 μM) and/or AMD3100
  (AMD, 30 μM) for 48 h. Densitometric analysis of protein levels relative to β-actin
  or LC3I levels (n = 3 per group). The data in the graph are presented as the mean
  ± SEM. NS, not significant. (C). Immunohistochemistry analysis of HIF-1α and LC3
  in 4T1 mammary tumor tissues following PBS (control), KR (20 mg/kg/day, oral injection),
  or KR and AMD (7.5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injection) treatment for 7 days. Scale
  bars, 50 μm.
