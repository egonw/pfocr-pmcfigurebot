figure_title: Targeted mutation of miR-275 and miR-305 impaired physiological metabolism
caption: '(A-B) Relative expression levels of mature miR-275 (A) and miR-305 (B) in
  homozygote (-/-), heterozygote (+/-), and wild-type flies. (C-E) Effects of miRNA
  mutation on energy substrate metabolism in heterozygote. (C) TAG content. (D) glycogen
  content. (E) total sugar content (glucose plus trehalose). Data were normalized
  to total protein content. Data represent seven to ten biological replicates with
  three technical replicates. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001, and ****,
  P < 0.0001 (Student’s t-test). (F-F’) Nile Red staining of lipid droplets. The fat
  body was obtained from miR-275-/-, miR-305-/-, and wild-type females at 5 DPE. Red,
  Nile Red staining for neutral lipids; and blue, DAPI staining for nuclei. Lipid
  droplets were visualized and imaged with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Scale
  bar: 10 μm.), and the size was quantified using ImageJ.'
