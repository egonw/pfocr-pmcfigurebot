caption: Biological Causes of Resistance. Resistance-causing mechanisms can be classified
  into distinct subgroups, including 1) systemic barriers limiting drug access, 2)
  cell level barriers hampering intracellular drug levels and efficacy, 3) mutations
  or downregulation of the direct drug target, 4) alternative mutations downstream
  or orthogonal to the drug targets re-establishing the targeted pathway, 5) broader
  alterations in bypass pathways, transcriptional programs and cell lineages causing
  tumor-intrinsic resistance and clonal evolution under treatment, and 6) tumor-supportive
  extrinsic mechanisms from the tumor microenvironment.
