caption: 'COF could efficiently attenuate acute elevated-IOP-induced RGC death. (A):
  Schematic representation of treatments before retina patching. (B): Representative
  continuous images (40×) of Fluoro-Gold labelled RGCs in entire mount retinas. (C):
  Quantitative analysis showed that the number of surviving RGCs increased significantly
  in COF injected ischemic eyes compared to NS control (n = 6–12). (D,E): GO ad KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis in ischemic retinas 5 days after reperfusion between
  COF group and NS control. ** indicates p < 0.01.'
