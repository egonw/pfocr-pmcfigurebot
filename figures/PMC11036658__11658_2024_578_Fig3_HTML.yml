caption: (+)-ABX induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells. A Measurement of mitochondrial
  membrane potential (MMP) in cells treated with (+)-ABX (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for
  24 h using JC-1 staining. B NSCLC cells exposed to various concentrations of (+)-ABX
  were evaluated for apoptosis through Hoechst33342 staining assays. C Flow cytometry-based
  annexin V/FITC/PI staining was conducted after a 24 h exposure to (+)-ABX to quantify
  cell apoptosis rates in each phase. D Relative mRNA expression of apoptosis-related
  genes in NSCLC cells treated with (+)-ABX (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h. E Cellular
  exposure to (+)-ABX (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h was followed by western blotting
  to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. F Relative protein expression
  of apoptosis-related factors. Data were presented as means ± SD. * P < 0.05, **
  P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared with the control. Information was collected
  from a minimum of three independent experiments
