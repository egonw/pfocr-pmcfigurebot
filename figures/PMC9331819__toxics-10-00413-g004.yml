caption: Effect of BPS on BDNF, TrkB, CREB and p-CREB expression in mouse hippocampus.
  (A) Expression of BDNF mRNA. (B) expression of TrkB mRNA. (C) Expression of CREB
  mRNA. (D) Expression of BDNF protein. (E) expression of TrkB protein. (F) Ratio
  of p-CREB protein/CREB protein. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3);
  compared with the control group * p < 0.05. (G) Grayscale scan of BDNF, TrkB, CREB
  and p-CREB expression measured by Western blotting.
