caption: CircRREB1 binds to GNB4 and GNB4 enhances the protein level of p-Erk1/2 in
  BC cells. A. RNA pull-down assay was performed using specific biotin-labeled circRREB1
  to detect the proteins interacting with circRREB1, mass spectrometry and silver
  staining were performed to identify the interacting proteins. B. The interaction
  between circRREB1 and GNB4 was verified by Western blot. C. The enrichment ratio
  of circRREB1 with GNB4 antibody was determined by RIP assay, compared with IgG.
  D. The co-localization of circRREB1 and GNBE in BC cells was examined by FISH and
  IF co-staining (magnification, × 400, Scale bar, 50um). E. KEGG pathway analysis
  of pulled-down proteins from BC cells with biotin-labeled probes targeting the circRREB1.
  F-G. The expression of Erk1/2 and p-Erk1/2 was detected by Western blot after GNB4
  overexpression or knockdown. H. The relative expression of GNB4 in 20 pairs of BC
  tissues and paracancerous tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. I. Pearson correlation
  analysis revealed that the expression of GNB4 was positively correlated with the
  level of circRREB1. The data are presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
