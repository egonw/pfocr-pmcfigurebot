caption: Knockdown of KDM1A could sensitize lung cell to ferroptosis. (A) The GSEA
  pathway analysis revealed that KDM1A co-expressed genes might involve in the cell
  ferroptosis process. (B, C) The colony formation assay was performed in H1299 and
  A549 stable cell lines with KDM1A knockdown. (D, E) The effect of erastin and ferrostatin-1
  on the cell viability of KDM1A knockdown cells. (F, G) Cellular Fe2+ levels were
  detected in KDM1A knockdown cells treated with erastin. (H, I) Cellular MDA levels
  were detected in KDM1A knockdown cells treated with erastin. (J, K) The HMOX1 expression
  levels were analyzed in KDM1A knockdown cells. According to the molecular weight,
  the nitrocellulose membrane was cut prior to hybridization with antibodies and the
  original blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. . The graphs represent mean ± SD,
  two-tailed, Student’s t-test. N = 3, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; **p < 0.001.
