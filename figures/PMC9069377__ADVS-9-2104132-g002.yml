caption: Chronic stress attenuates CD8+ T cell function via GPR54. OT‐1 mice with
  AR for 18 days, splenic CD8+ T cells activated with α‐CD3/α‐CD28, OT‐1 cells, and
  RM‐1‐ovalbumin (OVA)‐green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells cocultures with E:T =
  1:2 for killing assessment A) (n = 5). Gpr54 +/+‐OT‐1 and Gpr54 −/−‐OT‐1 cells cocultured
  with RM‐1‐OVA‐GFP cells at indicated effector‐to‐target ratio for killing assessment
  B) (n = 6). Rag2−/− mice were implanted with 106 LLC‐OVA tumor cells by subcutaneous
  injection, followed by an intravenous injection of 106 OT‐1 CD8+ T cells. Then,
  C) the end‐point tumor picture and D) tumor growth curves and tumor sizes were represented
  (n = 5). FCM analysis of the proportions of E) tumor PD‐1+ CD8+ and F) LAG‐3+ CD8+
  cell populations after adoptively transferred OT‐1 cells (n = 4). G) Gpr54 fl/fl
  and Gpr54 fl/flCD4Cre mice on day 18 after AR implanted with 106 LLC tumor cells
  by a subcutaneous injection, and the mice were subjected to AR treatment daily.
  LLC tumor growth curves and the end‐point tumor sizes are represented (n = 5). All
  data are from at least three independent experiments. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by an unpaired Student's t‐test
  (A–F) or one‐way ANOVA followed by LSD analysis (G).
