caption: Proportion of SMuRFless STEMI Patients and All-Cause Mortality(A) Increase
  in the percentage of STEMI patients with no SMuRFs in a single-center study, Sydney,
  Australia (P < 0.01). The blue line represents the regression fit using individual
  patient data, the shaded area depicts a pointwise 95% CI, and the dotted lines show
  average values per year. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrating excess mortality
  up to 30 days in SMuRFless (blue line) compared to >0-SMuRF (red line) STEMI patients
  in SWEDEHEART (The Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based
  care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) (P < 0.0001).
  Sex aggregated analysis from data included in the previous publication, used with
  permission of the authors and data custodian. SMuRF = standard modifiable cardiovascular
  risk factor; STEMI = ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.
