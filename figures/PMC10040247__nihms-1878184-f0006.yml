figure_title: The macrophage-mediated CCL21/CCR7 pathway in RA pathogenesis
caption: WT mice were injected intra-articularly with Ad-Ctrl or Ad-CCL21, on day
  0 and day 7, before ankles were collected on day 10 for immunohistochemistry and
  qRT-PCR analysis. (a-b) Tissue sections were stained for CD3 and Vimentin (n=6)
  and staining was scored on a 0–5 scale. (c-d) Tissue sections were TRAP stained
  to allow quantification of the number of TRAP+ osteoclasts in the treated joints
  (n=7). (e) Gene expression of proteins related to osteoclastogenesis was evaluated,
  expressed as a fold change (2−ΔΔCt) of baseline gene expression (Ad-Ctrl) (n=6).
  (f-g) Sections were also stained for endothelial cell marker VWF and staining was
  scored on a 0–5 scale (n=7). (h) RNA levels related to the vasculature were evaluated
  (n=6). All data are presented as mean ± sem. * p<0.05 ** p<0.01 (i) CCL21-triggered
  immune cell accumulation and M1-Th17 crosstalk promote RA pathogenesis, leading
  to intra-articular angiogenesis, osteoclastogenesis and progressive joint destruction,
  as schematically summarized.
