caption: The ways of electron transport in the thylakoid membrane under high light
  intensities and over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool (PQ). The scheme shows
  linear electron transport (LET), cyclic electron transport (CET), which takes place
  with the participation of the proteins PGR5 and PGRL1 or/and the NDH complex, and
  the activity of PTOX in the chlororespiration process. The content of complexes
  and the activity of the electron transport pathway will differ in the M and BS chloroplasts
  in particular metabolic subtypes and depending on environmental conditions.
