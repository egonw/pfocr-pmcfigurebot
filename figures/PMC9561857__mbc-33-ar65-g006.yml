caption: TAK1 inhibition induces β-cat degradation via a proteasomal pathway to destabilize
  endothelial barrier. (A, B) HLMVECs were first treated with OZ (1 μM) or vehicle
  for 1 h and then thrombin- or LPS-induced phosphorylation of β-cat on S33, S37,
  and T41 was measured. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments.
  Quantified data are expressed as the ratio (mean ± SEM) of phosphorylated:total
  protein after OZ treatment vs. control. *p < 0.01; **p < 0.001. (C, D) HLMVECs incubated
  with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 μM) for 2 h followed by 1 μM OZ for 1 h were
  exposed to either thrombin (25 nM) (C) or LPS (1 μg/ml) (D) for indicated time periods.
  Then, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-cat Ab and blotted with antipan
  ubiquitin Ab. Quantified data from three experiments are expressed as ratio (mean
  ± SEM) of ubiquitin:β-cat in OZ-treated group vs. control. **p < 0.001. (E) HLMVECs
  were treated with vehicle, OZ (1 μM), or OZ (1 μM) plus SB216763 (1 μM) for 1 h
  followed by specific staining for β-cat (red), VE-cad (green), or nucleus (DAPI,
  blue). Then, cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. (F, G) HLMVECs grown to
  confluence and treated with vehicle (control), 1 μM OZ, or 1 μM OZ plus 1 μM SB
  (SB216763) were used to measure real-time changes in TER to assess endothelial barrier
  integrity in response to thrombin (F) or LPS (G). Arrows indicate the time of addition
  of inhibitors, thrombin (25 nM), or LPS (1 μg/ml). In (F) **p < 0.001, OZ vs. SB
  + OZ, or thrombin alone vs. SB + thrombin; In G, *p < 0.01, LPS vs. OZ + LPS; **p
  < 0.001, vehicle vs. LPS; **p < 0.001, OZ+LPS vs. SB+OZ+LPS.
