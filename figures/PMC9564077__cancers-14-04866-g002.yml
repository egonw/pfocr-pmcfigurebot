caption: 'Identification of hub gene of T cytotoxic pathway in BCa. (A) Locations
  of T cytotoxic pathway-related genes on 23 chromosomes. (B) Interaction of T cytotoxic
  pathway-related genes. (C) Correlation analysis among T cytotoxic pathway-related
  genes. (D) Correlation analysis between T cytotoxic pathway-related genes and TIICs.
  (E) The association of the CD8+ T cells with T cytotoxic pathway-related genes.
  (F,G) Univariate Cox analyses of the T cytotoxic pathway-related genes in BCa. BCa,
  bladder cancer; TIICs, tumor-infiltrating immune cells; OS, overall survival; DFS,
  disease-free survival. **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001.'
