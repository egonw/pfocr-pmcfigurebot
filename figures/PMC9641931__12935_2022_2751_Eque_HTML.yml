caption: Decreased TFs with good prognosis are co-expressed with genes associated
  with the apoptotic pathway. (A) Co-expression network is shown for genes that are
  significantly associated with reduced TFs (R > 0.5, P < 0.01). (B) Enrichment outcomes
  of genes that were highly correlated with downregulated TFs and presented in the
  co-expression network.
