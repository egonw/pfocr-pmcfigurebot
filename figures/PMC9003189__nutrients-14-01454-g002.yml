caption: 'Main metabolic and catabolic effects of mTORC pathway activation. From the
  left to the right: amino acids activate the Rag kinases, which enhance cell survival
  and cytoskeletal organization toward mTORC2 complex activation. Growth factors and
  insulin triggers the RAS/PI3K cascade which leads to the activation of TSC1/2, thus
  allowing mTORC1 activation throw Rheb kinase. mTORC1 can be activated also by glucose
  via AMPK, and it ultimately leads to cell growth and proliferation.'
