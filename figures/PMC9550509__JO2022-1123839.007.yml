caption: 'FLOT1 overexpression resisted miR-1271-5p upregulation-induced inhibition
  of EMT in CC cells. (a-e) The expressions of MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin and N-cadherin
  in CC (SiHa and ME180) cells after transfection with FLOT1 overexpression plasmids
  or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination were analyzed by qRT-PCR (a-c) and
  western blot (d, e), with GAPDH as the reference gene. +P or ^P or #P < 0.05; ++P
  or ^^P or ##P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P or ###P < 0.001; + vs. FLOT1+MC; ^ vs. NC+MC;
  # vs. FLOT1+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical cancer; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction; NC: negative control; M: miR-1271-5p mimic; MC: mimic
  control; FLOT1: flotillin 1; MMP2: matrix metalloproteinase-2; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase-9.'
