caption: 'MAS1 inhibits the activation of AGTR1 by formatting a heterocomplex. a)
  Saturation BRET assays of MAS1 and AGTR1 interaction. A fixed amount of luciferase‐tagged
  AGTR1 (AGTR1‐NL, 0.25 µg) was co‐expressed with increasing amounts of YFP‐tagged
  MAS1 (MAS1‐YFP, 0–2.0 µg) in HEK293 cells. The total amount of transfected DNA was
  balanced with the pcDNA3.1 vector. The association curve of BRET signal reflects
  a specific protein–protein interaction. b) In HEK293 cells, co‐expression of MAS1 inhibited
  AGTR1‐mediated Ang II signaling in the SRE pathway. For the control experiments,
  AGTR1 or MAS1 were co‐transfected with pcDNA3.1. c) In HEK293 cells, the calcium
  response induced by AGTR1 was impaired by co‐expression of MAS1. Ang II (100 nm)
  was added at 20 s; signals between 0 and 20 s were defined as the baseline. d) Comparison
  of the maximum calcium response when different amounts of MAS1 were co‐transfected.
  e) Schematic diagram showing the location of tetracysteine tag sequence (CCPGCC)
  tags on AGTR1. f–i) The intramolecular net BRET signal was measured in HEK293 cells
  transfected with the indicated constructs. Cells were stimulated with or without
  Ang II (100 nm) as indicated. j,k) In OVCA429 cells, saMAS1/AD treatment significantly
  reduced the calcium response that induced by Ang II. All data in this figure are
  presented as mean ± SEM values from ≥3 experiments. p values were calculated by
  the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software). *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 versus
  control (one‐way ANOVA); #p < 0.05 versus control (unpaired t‐test); ###p < 0.001 versus
  HBSS control (one‐way ANOVA).'
