caption: Mon attenuates TRAP activity and actin ring formation in BMMs. (A) Phalloidin
  staining to detect F-actin ring formation of osteoclast in response to Mon treatment.
  BMMs were incubated with M-CSF (30 ng/mL), RANKL (20 ng/mL) for 48 h and then treated
  with different concentrations of Mon (0.1, 1, and 10 µM) in present of 30 ng/mL
  M-CSF, 200 ng/mL LPS for 6 days and then stained with phalloidin (n = 3). (B) TRAP
  activity of osteoclasts in response to Mon treatment (n = 6). The data are expressed
  as means ± SD. ** p < 0.01 compared with ctrl group.
