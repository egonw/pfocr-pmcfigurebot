caption: Study overview. This study involves the first‐generation offspring in the
  Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) multigenerational cohort,
  in which 14,541 pregnant women, resident in the South West of England, were recruited
  in the 1990s. First, we constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) for BMI for all first‐generation
  offspring. Under the recall‐by‐genotype study design, we recalled the plasma samples
  (collected at the age‐24‐years clinic) of individuals with a low‐ (yellow) or high‐
  (blue) BMI GRS for further analysis. Then metabolites in those plasma samples were
  quantified by Metabolon. Finally, we performed statistical analysis to compare the
  metabolite levels between the two BMI GRS groups. Our results are relevant to understanding
  the role of metabolites both as intermediates on the pathway to BMI and from BMI
  to disease. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
