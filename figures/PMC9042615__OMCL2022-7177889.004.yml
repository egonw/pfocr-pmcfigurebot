caption: 'LGR6 was reduced in DKD and reversed by MaR1 treatment. (a) Representative
  immunohistochemistry images showing the localization and expression of LGR6 in kidney
  of DKD patients. Bar: 100 μm. (b) Representative western blotting analysis images
  showing the protein levels of LGR6 in DKD mouse model. (c) Representative immunofluorescence
  images showing the localization and expression of LGR6 in kidney of mouse model.
  Bar: 100 μm. (d) Representative western blotting analysis images showing the protein
  levels of LGR6 in HK-2 cells stimulated by high glucose (40 nM). (e) Representative
  immunohistochemistry images showing the localization and expression of LGR6 in kidney
  of DKD mouse model with MaR1 intervention. Bar: 100 μm. (f) qRT-PCR showing the
  mRNA levels of LGR6 in DKD mouse model with MaR1 intervention. (g) Representative
  western blotting analysis images showing the protein levels of LGR6 in DKD mouse
  model with MaR1 intervention. (h) qRT-PCR showing the mRNA levels of LGR6 in high
  glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells with MaR1 intervention. (i) Representative western
  blotting analysis images showing the protein levels of LGR6 in high glucose-stimulated
  HK-2 cells with MaR1 intervention. All results are representative of three independent
  experiments. Data were expressed as mean ± SD; ∗P <0.05; ∗∗P <0.01; ∗∗∗P <0.001.'
