caption: RNA-seq analysis of morusin treated U87 cells. (A,B) Gene Ontology (GO) and
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated
  mRNA after morusin treatment. (C,D) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of down-regulated
  mRNA. (E,F) GSEA-based KEGG enrichment plots of representative gene sets from activated
  pathway (protein export) and suppressed pathway (cell cycle). (G) Heatmap of mRNA
  expression levels in two KEGG gene sets (ERs and G1/S).
