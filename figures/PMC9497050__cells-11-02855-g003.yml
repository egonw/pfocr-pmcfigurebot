caption: 'MYH9 modulated intracellular ROS level leads to radioresistance in HNC cells.
  (A) MYH9 silencing increased ROS production in HNC cells. After transfection of
  MYH9-shRNA plasmids in theboth HNC cells (OECM-1 and Detroit 562), the ROS level
  was determined using the H2DCF-DA oxidation method and analyzed by flow cytometry.
  (B) MYH9 silencing reduced the Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Upper: A schematic
  representation of the pGL3 promoter-8xARE construct which was identified for measuring
  Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Lower: A luciferase report assay was used to compare
  the relative level of Nrf2 transcriptional activity in the HNC cells (OECM-1 and
  Detroit 562) transfected with MYH9-shRNA (sh-M) versus control transfectant (Vt).
  (C,D) MYH9 silencing inhibited the expression of ROS scavenger enzymes at the mRNA
  level of the OECM1 cells (C) and the protein (D) levels in two HNC cell lines. (E)
  Significantly higher expressions of ROS scavenger enzymes (GCLC, and GCLM) in HNC
  tumor samples compared to the normal samples. Correlative expressions between MYH9
  and ROS scavenger enzymes-associated molecules GCLC and GCLM, in the HNC tumor samples.
  The gene expression data were retrieved from the TCGA-HNSC dataset. All the experiments
  were performed at least three times independently, and a typical result was shown.
  The error bars shown in the relevant figures indicate the standard deviation of
  the quantification results in all experiments. (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***:
  p < 0.001, t-test).'
