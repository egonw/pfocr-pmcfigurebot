caption: TFAP4 and NFκB as cooperating mediators of CAR T-cell sensitivity. A, Schematic
  of RNA-seq experimental design; overlap highlights genes of highest interest, with
  differential transcriptional changes upon TFAP4 loss and gain. B, Volcano plot showing
  differential gene expression upon TFAP4 knockout in HupT3 cells and colored according
  to the LFC of each gene in TFAP4 overexpressing HupT3 cells. C, MSigDB Hallmark
  gene sets for IFN alpha response (M5911) and IFNγ response (M5913) clustered according
  to their differential expression in HupT3 cells upon TFAP4 loss and overexpression
  (z-score of TPM value mapped for each gene); MSigDB gene sets combined to remove
  duplicates. D, Transcriptional and pathway enrichments, identified by Enrichr, of
  genes upregulated upon TFAP4 knockout with a log2P value of >20 [input of 565 genes;
  H, human; M, mouse; adjusted P value calculated via Benjamini–Hochberg method; bar
  length corresponds to P value (Fisher exact test)]. Purple, RELA/NFκB-related enrichments.
  E, Survival curves, quantified by CTG assay, of HupT3 cells following knockout of
  TFAP4 and treatment with multimeric FASL or TRAIL at the indicated concentrations
  for 24 hours (n = 3 each). F, Survival of HupT3 cells, quantified by firefly luciferase
  assay, upon concurrent knockout of RELA and TFAP4 and coculture with MSLN CAR T
  or UTD control cells for 24 hours (n = 3; Dunnett test). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
  ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.
