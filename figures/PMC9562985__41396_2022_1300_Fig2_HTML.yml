figure_title: Nitrogen-cycling gene transcription at site C groundwater and site D
  groundwater and attached-fraction enriched groundwater
caption: 'A Nitrogen cycle schematics display the average abundance of nitrogen-cycling
  transcripts (based on modified-TPM values) per site and sample type (relative to
  nitrogen-cycling pathways overall (as shown). The percentage of gene transcripts
  associated with each pathway component is shown in black font. Coloured arrows represent
  pathways (purple = nitrification, green = denitrification and red = anammox). Only
  NrfA and not NirBD are shown for the DNRA pathway. B Heatmap shows nitrogen-cycling
  modified transcripts per million (modified-TPM) at each site (ordered gwj9, gwj11,
  gwj13-gwj16), scaled by row (Z-Score). Solid coloured blocks represent groundwater,
  black grid blocks represent the attached-fraction (or biomass) enriched groundwater.
  C Stacked bar plots display four active nitrogen-cycling genomes and the relative
  abundance (modified-TPM normalized to genome coverage) of their nitrogen-cycling
  gene transcripts across each site. Abbreviations: amo ammonia monooxygenase, pmo
  particulate methane monooxygenase, xmo copper-containing membrane monooxygenase,
  nod nitric oxide dismutase, nxr nitrite oxidoreductase, nar nitrate reductase (dissimilatory),
  nap periplasmic nitrate reductase, nirK copper-containing nitrite reductase, nirS
  cytochrome cd1-containing nitrite reductase, nor nitric oxide reductase, nos nitrous
  oxide reductase, nrf nitrate reductase, hzo hydrazine oxidoreductase, hao hydroxylamine
  oxidoreductase.'
