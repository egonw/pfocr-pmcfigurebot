caption: Functional role of the eLPBChAT–CeAGABApathway. (A) Schematic diagram of
  the viral transfection in WT mice and the patch-clamp recording in brain slices.
  (B) Representative images of current-clamp recording on rAAV2/9-ChAT-hM3Dq-mCherry
  (Gq) transfected neurons in the eLPB (left), sample traces and summarized data of
  sAP in eLPBChAT neurons (right) after CNO treatment. n = 6 cells from six mice.
  Scale bar, 400 μm. (C) Representative images of patch-clamp recording on the rAAV2/9-VGAT1-EGFP
  transfected neurons in the CeA (left), sample traces and summarized data of frequency
  (middle, n = 6 cells from six mice, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test) and amplitude
  (right, n = 6 cells from six mice, one-way RM ANOVA with Tukey post-test) of sEPSC
  in response to CNO and MEC. Scale bar, 400 μm. (D) Schematic diagram of viral transfection
  and optical fibre implantation in the eLPB and CeA. (E) Heatmap of GCaMp6m fluorescence
  at 0–50 min after CNO administration. (F) Quantification of the peak ΔF/F. (G) Go
  and Gq-evoked AUC. n = 6 mice, two-way ANOVA with Sidak post-test.
