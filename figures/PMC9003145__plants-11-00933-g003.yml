caption: GNOM-mediated faster root growth recovery mechanism under cold stress. (Left)
  Balanced auxin homeostasis in the epidermal cell layers of root at 23 Â°C. (Middle)
  Low temperature-mediated inhibition of PIN2 trafficking and altered auxin gradient
  in the epidermal cell layers at the root. (Right) GNOM-engineered BFA-resistant
  line helps to retain functional PIN2 trafficking under cold stress to maintain proper
  auxin gradient for root growth.
