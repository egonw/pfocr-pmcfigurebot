figure_title: The activation of TCF3, TCF4 and IRF4 downstream of p38α in PC differentiation
caption: a Cultured p38α−/− B cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding p38α
  or p38α kinase-dead mutations (K53M or T180A/Y182F) (GFP+) and luciferase reporter
  harboring TCF3, TCF4 or IRF4 binding sites in Prdm1 enhance region at day 2, and
  luciferase activity in retrovirus-infected B cells (CD19+GFP+) was analyzed at day
  8 in iPC culture (n = 3 per group). b p38−/− 293 A cells were transfected with indicated
  plasmids, and the luciferase activity of IRF4 mutants was analyzed 24 h after transfection.
  Immunoblot analysis of p38α, p-p38α, IRF4 and Actin in p38−/− 293 A cells transfected
  with indicated plasmids (n = 3 per group). c Cultured Irf4−/− B cells were transduced
  with retroviruses encoding IRF4 or IRF4 mutants (T267A, T268A, T269A) at day 2,
  iPCs in retrovirally transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) 6 days after transduction
  were analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 5 per group), and protein levels of IRF4, IgG
  H-chain, BLIMP1 and Actin were analyzed by immunoblot. Data were representative
  of at least three independent experiments. Each symbol represents a representative
  sample. Small horizontal lines indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by
  two-tailed unpaired t-tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
