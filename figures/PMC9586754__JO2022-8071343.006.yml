caption: Upstream miRNAs regulating ZFP57 were analyzed. (a) miRWalk database was
  used in conjunction with the GEO database to predict miRNAs targeting ZFP57. (b)
  RNA pull-down assay was performed on BxPC3-RR cells. The enriched miRNA was determined
  by qPCR. (c) The binding site of ZFP and miR-193a-5p was predicted by bioinformatics
  tools. The prediction was further verified by the luciferase reporter gene assay.
  The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed on the transfected BxPC3-RR
  cells. (d) In BxPC3-RR cells, miR-193a-5p expression was silenced. mRNA and protein
  expressions of ZFP57 were determined by qPCR and WB assay, respectively. (e) miR-193a-5p
  overexpression was induced in BxPC3-P cells. The protein and miRNA levels of ZFP57
  were determined by WB and qPCR. (f) miR-193a-5p levels in pancreatic cancer tissues
  were determined by qPCR. (g) Pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to IR, and the
  miR-193a-5p expression was detected by qPCR subsequently. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗P <
  0.01.
