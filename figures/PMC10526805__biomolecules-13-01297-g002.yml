caption: Overview of the cytoplasmic scaffolding of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The PI3K/Akt
  pathway is initiated by multiple cell surface receptors and facilitated by different
  scaffolding proteins. CNK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane via insulin stimulation,
  bringing cytohensin-2 with it to activate PIPKI-mediated PI(4,5)P2synthesis. EBP50
  and PHB are both inhibitory scaffold proteins that promote PI(3,4,5)P3 dephosphorylation
  by recruiting PTEN and SHIP1, respectively, to sites of Akt activation. DAB2IP also
  functions as an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway by scaffolding and translocating
  p85 and Akt from the membranes to cytosol. APPL1, IQGAP1, and MAP4 are endosomal
  scaffolding protein for Akt activation. APPL1 scaffolds PI3K-C2γ and Akt2 in response
  to multiple receptor stimulations, and promotes Akt2 activation via PI(3,4)P2synthesis.
  LAPTM4B prolongs EGFR signaling via Hrs ubiquitination, resulting in the inhibition
  of EGFR sorting, while the PIPKIγi5-PI(4,5)P2-SNX5 complex on the endosome counteracts
  this effect. IQGAP1 and MAP4 form a PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis complex by recruiting PI4KIIIα,
  PIPKIα, and PI3Kα in close proximity, and channel de novo PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 to
  PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis under EGF or insulin stimulation. IQGAP1 also interacts with
  the PI(3,4,5)P3 effectors PDK1 and Akt, scaffolding the entire PI3K/Akt pathway
  in a processive manner. Additionally, illustrated is the PITT pathway of rapid lysosome
  repair, in which PI(4)P generated by PI4KIIα recruits ORP dimers as lipid transfer
  complexes. Figure created with biorender.com.
