caption: 'JQ1 suppressed the migration and invasion of GC cells in vitro. After treating
  with JQ1 (20 μM), the migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells that transfected with
  sgRNA-DSC2 and sgRNA-NC were detected by scratch wound-healing assay ((a) 60×),
  transwell migration assay ((b) 200×), and transwell invasion assay ((c) 200×). (d)
  The expressions of DSC2 and Snail were determined by Western blot assay. Data are
  presented as mean ± SD from three separate experiments. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs. sgRNA-NC. ###p < 0.001 vs. Low-DSC2 group.'
