caption: 'Characteristics of CRC parenchymal cells and activation of JAK-STAT pathway
  in hypoxic CD44+ stem cells.a. UMAP plot showing 11 clusters of cancer cells (C01,
  C02, C03, C04, C05, C07, C09, C11) and paracancerous epithelium cells (E06, E08,
  E10).b. Copy number variation (CNV) presumption of nonmalignant cells and malignant
  cells.c. Scatter plots and statistical differences of nonmalignant cells (p < 0.05:
  * and p < 0.01: **).d. UMAP plot showing S, G2M, differentiation (epithelial or
  mesenchymal) score (red: high score, blue: low score).e. Composition of different
  phases (G1, G2M and S) and states (epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation).f.
  Dot plot of top5 genes displaying heterogeneity within and between tumors.g. Co-expression
  mode of NEAT1 and CD44 showing by violin plots and feature plots.h. NEAT1+CD44+
  clusters (C09 and C11) KEGG enrichment pathway.i. Key genes expression heatmap of
  JAK-STAT pathway.'
