caption: Summary of the proposed cellular signalling affected by PPV. Red crosses
  indicate the possible sites where PPV exerts its effects. Solid black arrows indicate
  the pathways and dotted arrows indicate a possible interaction. HMGB1 interacts
  with RAGE which induces cellular signals that affect several pathways. Once NF-kB
  is activated, it translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with DNA and upregulates
  the transcription of several genes, including HMGB1 and TNF. The interaction of
  HMGB1 with T Cell immunoglobulin mucin–3 (TIM-3) induces the secretion of VEGF to
  promote tumour angiogenesis, an immunoregulatory protein. VEGF can then stimulate
  MEK, which leads to ERK activation. AC controls the formation of cAMP from 5′AMP,
  and PDE10A degrades cAMP back into 5′AMP. Inhibition of PDE10A can lead to the build-up
  of cAMP, which increases the available levels of PKA and PGE2. PKA can then upregulate
  CREB, which increases the transcription of several downstream molecules, including
  HMGB1, and surviving. HMGB1 can inhibit the caspase 3/9 pathway, releasing proapoptotic
  inhibitors such as BAX and controls the protein levels of Bcl-2 [,]. Image designed
