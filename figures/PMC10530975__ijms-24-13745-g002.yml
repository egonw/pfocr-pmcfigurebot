caption: Effect of RAPA treatment on transcriptomic changes in head kidney granulocytes
  of largemouth bass. (A) Volcano plot displaying the DEG distribution in the RAPA
  treatment group compared with the control group. (B) The number of DEGs in each
  KEGG pathway. Different colors represent different categories. (C,E) The major upregulated
  (C) and downregulated (E) KEGG pathways in the RAPA treatment group compared with
  the control group. (D,F) The expression of differential genes in the KEGG pathway
  that were mainly upregulated (D) and downregulated (F) in the RAPA treatment group
  compared with the control group. Positive numbers on the Y axis mean upregulation,
  while negative values mean downregulation.
