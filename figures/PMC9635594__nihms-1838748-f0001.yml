caption: MUC1-C promotes the activation of PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and the regulation
  of stemness genes such as Nanog, Oct3/4, Sox2, CXCR, and ALDH1, which are responsible
  for chemoresistance in lung cancer cells. This leads to MUC1-C mediated PTX resistance.
  The nuclear translocation of MUC1 stimulates chemotherapy resistance via the upregulation
  of ABCB1 in an EGFR-dependent manner. MUC1 provides the resistance to drugs (PTX)
  by directly regulating ABCC1, ABCB1 gene expression, dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Moreover, the stimulation of PI3K/Akt pathway by MUC1-Cter, in turn, increases the
  expression of MUC1. The MUC4/NF-κB pathway downregulates the expression of the hCNT1
  transporter and regulates the apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-xL; thus, it aids the
  pancreatic cancer cells in resisting gemcitabine. Similarly, MUC4 also activates
  NF-κB through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. MUC4 alters the stability of Her2 protein,
  and auranofin downregulates the Her2 protein. When the expression of MUC4 is attenuated,
  it aids auranofin in promoting FOXO3 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
  to regulate the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. The upregulation of the
  secretory mucin MUC5AC provides resistance to 5-FU via upregulation of β-catenin,
  CD44, and Lgr5 and down-regulation of p53 and p21 in colorectal cancer. MUC13/NFkB
  signaling pathway promotes drug resistance and prevents apoptosis by stimulating
  the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL, Survivin in sorafenib, or sunitinib treated
  renal cancer cells. MUC16/JAK2/STAT3/TSPYL5 signaling axis downregulates p53, which
  leads to chemoresistance (cisplatin and gemcitabine) in lung cancer cells. Ectopic
  expression of MUC16-Cter confers CSC phenotype via the Activation of JAK2, which
  phosphorylates histone-3 and upregulates stemness-specific genes like LMO2, NANOG,
  and ALDH activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Abbreviations of mucin mediated signaling
  pathways, their downstream target genes associated with chemoresistance, and anti-apoptosis
  upregulated genes are indicated in red-colored arrow and downregulated genes using
  the green colored arrow. Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH); ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily
