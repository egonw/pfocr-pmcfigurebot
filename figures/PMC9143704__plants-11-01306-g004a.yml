caption: Strategies for finding the target of Ac-EE in anti-inflammatory responses.
  (A) The phosphorylation levels of NF-κB subunits and the protein expression levels
  of the total forms of the subunits were detected in whole cell lysates of RAW264.7
  cells activated by 5 to 60 min of treatment with LPS after 30 min of pretreatment
  with 100 μg/mL Ac-EE. (B) Phosphorylation of the members of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, p85, AKT, and IκBα, upon 5 to 60 min of LPS stimulation, was assessed by
  Western blot analysis. (C) The phosphorylation and total protein levels of protein
  kinase Src were confirmed after 2 to 5 min of LPS induction. (D) Western blotting
  analysis on the superior and post-caval lobes from LPS-treated mice indicates the
  phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of p50, p65, IκBα, and Src.
  (E) The phosphorylation level of Src in HA-Src-transfected HEK293T cells was detected
  by Western blot. (F) Cellular thermal shift assay was performed to confirm the direct
  interaction between Src and Ac-EE.
