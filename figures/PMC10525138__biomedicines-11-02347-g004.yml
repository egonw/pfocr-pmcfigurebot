caption: 'Intracellular cAMP level increases by the β2, CGRP, and A2A receptor agonists,
  which were suppressed by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. (A,C,E) Representative
  traces of transient increases in intracellular cAMP level in response to 10 nM isoproterenol
  (ISO) (A), 1 µM CGRP (rat) (C), and 100 nM PSB0777 (E) without or with 0.1 µM SQ22536
  in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (2.5 mM). Black boxes indicate time periods
  of ISO (A), CGRP (rat) (C), and PSB0777 (E) addition to the extracellular solution.
  White boxes denote the time of addition of SQ22536 to the external solution. (B,D,F)
  Summary bar graphs of ISO- (B), CGRP (rat)- (D), and PSB0777- (F) induced intracellular
  cAMP level increases, with (middle columns) or without (upper columns) 0.1 µM SQ22536
  in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Each recovery (lower columns) indicates that
  SQ22536 acts reversibly. Each bar shows mean ± S.E. of eight (B), eight (D), and
  six (F) experiments. Asterisk: * p < 0.05 shows statistically significant differences
  between columns (indicated by a solid line).'
