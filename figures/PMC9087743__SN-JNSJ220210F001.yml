caption: Mixed valence discriminative cue responding task. a, Experimental timeline
  of the novel discriminative cue responding task. b, Rats were first trained to learn
  that lever pressing in the presence of a light stimulus leads to sucrose pellet
  reward on a fixed-ratio (FR1), then variable-ratio (VR5) schedule of reinforcement
  (App), lever pressing in the presence of a tone leads to the delivery of mild shock
  (Av), and lever pressing in the presence of a white noise has no programmed consequence
  (Neu). c, Upon successful demonstration of cue acquisition, in which App and AV
  and Neu cues were presented in extinction, (d) rats were microinfused with Muscimol/Baclofen
  (M/B) or saline into the PL or IL, NAc core or shell, or CNO (0.1 mm) or saline
  into the NAcc core or shell in PL-core and IL-shell pathway groups and administered
  a test session under extinction conditions (Cue Test, nonreinforced), in which they
  were presented with 10 trials each of the AP cue, Av cue, and App+Av cue, in randomized
  order. Rats were then given three retraining sessions, following which, (e) the
  same cue test was repeated, but this time with the alternate drug/saline. Rats underwent
  three further retraining sessions, and then underwent two further cue tests with
  outcomes (Cue Test, reinforced), with drug or saline administered before each.
