caption: 'A4B17 attenuates the expression of androgen response genes(A) A4B17 attenuates
  the expression of androgen response genes. Gene set enrichment analysis from RNA-seq
  data comparing DHT to A4B17 + DHT treatment showing AR response, fatty acids metabolism
  and cholesterol homeostasis enrichment plots.(B) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
  showing the attenuation of expression of some of the AR target genes identified
  in the RNA-seq studies. The bar charts represent the mean ± SEM of 6–7 independent
  experiments (∗: p < 0.05; ∗∗: p < 0.01).(C) Changes in AR target gene expression
  mediated by A4B17 treatment compared to BAG1L KO. Heatmap of differentially regulated
  AR target genes in control (BAG1L WT), and BAG1L KO LNCaP cells compared with changes
  in AR target gene expression in LNCaP cells treated with DHT, or A4B17 + DHT datasets.(D)
  Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showing the effect of A4B17 on DHT-mediated
  expression of select genes in the redox and metabolic pathways in control and BAG1L
  KO LNCaP cells. The bar charts represent the mean ± SEM of 6-7 independent experiments
  (∗: p < 0.05; ∗∗: p < 0.01, ∗∗∗: p < 0.001, n.s. not significant).(E and F) Reduced
  2′7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF) oxidation assay showing an impaired reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production in control compared to BAG1L KO LNCaP cells. ROS
  production was determined in control and BAG1L KO LNCaP cells treated with 10−8
  M androgen (R1881) for 96 h. The results represent the averages of H2DCF oxidation ±SEM
  (∗∗p < 0.01 n = 6).(F) ROS production in LNCaP cells treated with the indicated
  concentrations of A4B17 for 96 h and 10−8 M androgen (R1881) for 72 h. The results
  represent the averages of H2DCF oxidation ±SEM (∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 n = 1 with 6 technical
  replicates). Also see .'
