caption: KEGG pathway analysis on differentially abundant proteins from each comparison.
  Colors indicate the degree of enrichment. Blue represents stronger enrichment, green
  represents strong enrichment, and red represents moderate enrichment. The p-value
  according to Fisherâ€™s exact test indicates the significance level of the difference.
