caption: Silencing ACY1 in HCT116-R cells increased the sensitivity to radiation.
  (A) HCT116-R cells were transfected with siRNA-NC or siRNA-ACY1, and the protein
  levels of ACY1 were estimated by Western blotting. (B) Representative images and
  the survival fraction of colony formation in siRNA-NC or siRNA-ACY1 HCT116-R cells
  treated with 4 Gy irradiation. (C) Wound healing assay measuring the migration ability
  of HCT116-R cells transfected with siRNA-NC or siRNA-ACY1 at 24 h treated with 4
  Gy irradiation. (D) Transwell invasion assays were performed in HCT116-R cells transfected
  with siRNA-NC or siRNA-ACY1 at 48 h and treated with 4 Gy irradiation. All experiments
  were repeated at least three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± SD.
