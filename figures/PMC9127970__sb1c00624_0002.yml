caption: Workflow developed to engineerC. autoethanogenum to produce EG with a novel,
  synthetic metabolic pathway. (1) First, computational cheminformatics tools were
  used to design novel biosynthetic pathways, which were further curated using several
  pruning criteria. (2) The candidate pathways were then analyzed withC. autoethanogenumGEM
  to predict pathway feasibility and yield. (3) Finally, one candidate pathway was
  experimentally implemented and constructed inC. autoethanogenum, leading to EG production
  by this organism.
