caption: Single-cell sequencing data analysis of GSE231993 dataset. (A and B) The
  cell populations were clustered into seventeen populations. (C) Seventeen populations
  were combined into seven cell populations based on target gene expression. (D and
  E) Fibroblasts had a predominant high expression of APOL1 and CXCL1 compared to
  other cell populations. (F) The UC group had significantly higher expression of
  APOL1 and CXCL1. (G) CXCL1 expression exhibited a significant positive association
  with APOL1 expression.
