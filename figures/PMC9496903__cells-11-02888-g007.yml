caption: Schematic representation of the role of the ABA-LANCL1/2 system in the response
  of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to hypoxia. The ABA-LANCL1/2 hormone receptors system is
  activated by hypoxia in H9c2 cells. Either one of the LANCL proteins can, in turn,
  activate Akt and the AMPK/PGC-1α/Sirt1 pathway. Both phospho-Akt (Akt-P) and phospho-AMPK
  (AMPK-P) can phosphorylate and activate eNOS, leading to NO production, which exerts
  beneficial effects on cell viability and on mitochondrial function (oxidative metabolism
  and maintenance of the proton gradient). The regulatory pathway was probed by overexpressing
  or silencing the LANCL proteins, inhibiting or stimulating the activity of Akt and
  AMPK with specific pharmacologic modulators and by inhibiting NO production via
  L-NAME.
