caption: The autophagy-related genes of differential expression. (a) Heatmap of the
  autophagy-related genes of differential expression (ARG). N was tantamount to nontumor
  tissues; T was tantamount to tumor tissues. (b) Volcano plot on the ARGs of differential
  expressions. Orange dots indicated the ones of high expression whereas the blues
  were for the low expressions. (c) The boxplot for the ARGs of differential expression.
  Red and green regions separately represented tumor tissues and normal tissues.
