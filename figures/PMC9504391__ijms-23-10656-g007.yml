caption: A proposed model illustrating the mechanism of the OsABT gene to improve
  the salt tolerance of roots at the rice seedling stage. OsABT confers salt tolerance
  to rice seedling roots by inhibiting ROS accumulation, maintaining intracellular
  Na+ and K+ balance, and regulating the ABA content. Meanwhile, OsABT interacts with
  OsPYL4/10 and OsABIL2, and negatively regulates the expression of ABA signal transduction-related
  genes and ABA responsive genes, resulting in the attenuation of ABA signaling. OsABT
  may affect the ROS levels and Na+/K+ balance through the ABA signaling pathway to
  regulate root salt tolerance in rice seedlings.
