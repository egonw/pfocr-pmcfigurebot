caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathway of IL-1RAP with IL-1R I, IL-33R or IL-36R
  [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]. The interleukin binds to its main receptor, which induces
  the recruitment of the co-receptor IL-1RAP. The TIR intra-cellular domains of the
  receptor/co-receptor complex will recruit MyD88, which activates IRAK4 and IRAK1/2.
  This complex will then trigger TRAF6, which induces a kinases cascade through MAP3Ks,
  activating MAPKKs (1) and then stimulating the MAPKs p38, JNK, or ERK1/2. This will
  finally induce the AP-1 transcription factor. (2) TRAF 6 can also activate IKK,
  which induces the NF-κB transcription factor. (3) NF-κB can also be stimulated independently
  from TRAF 6 by IL-1R I and IL-33R (thanks to GAB2) through the activations cascade
  of PI3K, PDK-1, Akt and IKK. (4) Akt activation will also induce the inhibition
  of FoxO. (5) IL-33R is also able to stimulate AP-1 independently from TRAF 6 by
  the activations cascade of GAB2, and Ras/Raf signaling, which activates MEK1/2.
