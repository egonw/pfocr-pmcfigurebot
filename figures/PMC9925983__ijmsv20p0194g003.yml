caption: Loss of Klothoheterozygosity induces AMPK inactivation and reduces ubiquitination
  degradation of YAP. (A) Immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of
  AMPK on vascular endothelial cells (CD31+) in kidney tissue of Klotho+/- mice decreased
  significantly. Magnification 400×. scale bar = 30μm. (B) The results of western
  blot assay. (C) Co-IP western blot results showed that the loss of Klotho heterozygosity
  decreased the expression of AMPK and the phosphorylation level of YAP protein in
  mouse renal vascular endothelial cells, weakening its ubiquitination level. *P<0.05
  vs WT group, t test, n=4.
