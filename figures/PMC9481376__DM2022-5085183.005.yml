caption: 'Knockdown of SPAG5 ameliorated UV irradiation-mediated dysfunction of keratinocytes.
  (a) The si-NC and si-SPAG5 were transfected into HaCaT cells and the expression
  of SPAG5 was evaluated by RT-PCR 24 hours later. We then exposed the transfected
  HaCaT cells to UV irradiation and treated them with 5 μM curcumin for 24 hours.
  (b) UV-irradiated HaCaT cell proliferation was assayed with CCK-8. (c)–(f) The levels
  of SOD, GSH-PX, MDA, and ROS in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells were tested using an oxidative
  stress assay kit and cytofluorimetry. (g) Expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-18, and TNFα) in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells was checked by RT-PCR. (h) Expression
  of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-xL, Caspase3, Caspase8, Caspase9) in UV-irradiated
  HaCaT cells was detected by WB. (i) WB was implemented to testify the profiles of
  oxidative stress-related proteins (Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, COX2, and iNOS) in UV-irradiated
  HaCaT cells. (j) The expression of inflammatory response proteins (NF-κB, MMP1,
  and MMP9) in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells was evaluated by WB. (k) The SPAG5/FOXM1
  pathway expression in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells was testified by WB. N = 3. ∗p <
  0.05 (vs. si-NC or UV group), ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; #p < 0.05 (vs. si-SPAG5+UV
  group), ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.'
