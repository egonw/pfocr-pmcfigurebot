caption: (a) Effect of methanol-soluble steam-exploded lignin fraction (SEL-F2) on
  microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) protein expression levels
  in B16F10 melanoma cells. B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with 25, 50, and 100
  μg/mL SEL-F2 or arbutin prior to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) treatment
  for 8 h. The loading control was assessed using a β-actin antibody. (b) Quantitative
  analysis by Western blotting. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using
  antibodies against MITF. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
