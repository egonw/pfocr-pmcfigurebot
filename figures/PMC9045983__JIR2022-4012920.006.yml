caption: The schematic diagram depicts the molecular mechanism by which SETDB1 stimulates
  the immune evasion in CRC via the FOSB/miR-22/BATF3/PD-L1 axis. SETDB1 promotes
  FOSB methylation and inhibits FOSB expression, thereby reducing the expression of
  miR-22, enhancing BATF3 protein expression, and increasing PD-L1 expression in CRC
  cells. By this mechanism, SETDB1 augments the proliferation of CRC cells and inhibits
  their apoptosis as well as attenuating the killing effect of T cells on tumors,
  thereby favoring the immune escape of CRC.
