caption: Functional analysis of the METTL14/lncDBET pathway in progression of BCa.
  (A) CCK8 assay for the viability of EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shlncDBET.
  (B) Transwell, EdU and Flow cytometry assays for the migration, proliferation and
  apoptosis of EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shlncDBET and control shRNA
  (shNC). (C) Representative images of the xenograft tumors in Balbc nu/nu nude mice
  subcutaneously injected EJ-M3 cells transfected with shlncDBET or shNC. (D) The
  relative weight of tumors in Balbc nu/nu nude mice subcutaneously injected EJ-M3
  cells transfected with shlncDBET or shNC. (E-F) CCK8 assay for the viability of
  EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shNC, shMETTL14 and shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET.
  (G) Transwell, EdU and Flow cytometry assays for the migration, proliferation and
  apoptosis of EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shNC, shMETTL14 and shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET.
  Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The symbol * denotes a significant
  difference (P < 0.05), while ** represents a highly significant difference (P <
  0.01).
