caption: Quantitative DIA-SWATH/MS analysis of protein content in EVs secreted by
  subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in normal (control)
  and obese animals. (A,B) A volcano plot representation of elevated proteins in SAT
  EVs and VAT EVs from lean versus obese animals with a fold change >1.5; (C,D) cluster
  analysis by heat map representation of proteins in SAT EVs and VAT EVs with a fold
  change ≥2 and a p-value ≤ 0.05. (E) summary table with elevated proteins in EVs
  released from SAT and VAT of obese animals; (F) classification of the comparative
  functional enrichment (FunRich basis) according to cellular component, process,
  and biological pathway of the elevated proteins in SAT EVs and VAT EVs from normal
  (grey) and obese (orange) animals (F).
