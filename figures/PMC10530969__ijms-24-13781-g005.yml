caption: (A). The number of upregulated and downregulated genes in 4 different types
  of transcription factor gene families (MYB, bHLH, WD40, and LBD). (B). Correlation
  analysis of the associations between 4 transcription factor gene families related
  to flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Green diamonds represent transcription
  factors and blue circles represent structural genes. (C). Correlation heatmap of
  DEGs and DEMs involved in flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (ko00944) and the flavonoid
  biosynthesis pathway (ko00941). (D). The correlation network of DEGs and DEMs involved
  in flavone and flavonol biosynthesis and the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway with
  a p value less than 0.05 and an absolute correlation coefficient value greater than
  0.8. The blue hexagon represents the metabolites, the red square represents the
  genes, the red line represents the positive correlations, and the blue line represents
  the negative correlations.
