caption: 'Reward sensitivity affects intrinsic connectivity of the HIP.R-IFG.L through
  CAR. (A) A representative brain map showing the intrinsic connectivity of the right
  HIP and left IFG, which was significantly related to CAR. (B) CAR negatively correlated
  with intrinsic connectivity of the right HIP and left IFG (r = −0.55, PFDR = .006).
  (C) The intrinsic connectivity of the right HIP and left IFG positively correlated
  with deactivation estimate of the left putamen in the stress > control contrast
  (r = 0.30, P = .015). (D) The chain mediation model demonstrated a mediatory role
  of CAR and intrinsic connectivity of the right HIP and left IFG on the association
  between reward sensitivity and putamen activation during the stress task.HIP: hippocampus;
  IFG: inferior frontal gyrus; CAR: cortisol awakening response.'
