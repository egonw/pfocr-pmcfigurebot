caption: 'Serum levels of thyroid hormone in healthy women and patients with EC and
  protein expression of thyroid hormone receptors in the endometrium of patients with
  EC, endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH) and cultured human cells. (A) Serum levels
  of FT3, FT4, and TSH in healthy women of different ages: 20–29 (n = 31), 30–39 (n
  = 23), and more than 40 years of age (n = 13). (B) Serum levels of FT3, FT4, and
  TSH in the patients with EC (n = 41) and healthy women group (n = 67). (C) Protein
  expression of TRα in patients with progestin-sensitive (n = 12) or progestin-insensitive
  (n = 7) EAH/EC patients, and TRβ in patients with progestin-sensitive (n = 13) or
  progestin-insensitive (n = 7) EAH/EC. (D) TRα and TRβ were evaluated by the positive
  rate and are represented by dot plots. Results are presented as mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM). (E) Protein expression of TRα and TRβ in RL95-2 and KLE
  cells.'
