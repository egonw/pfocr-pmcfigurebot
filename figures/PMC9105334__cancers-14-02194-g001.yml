caption: 'Two distinct telomere extension mechanisms. Left: Through reverse transcriptase
  activity, telomerase extends the 3′-overhang of telomeres. Right: ALT pathway action
  depends on homologous recombination (HR) for telomere extension and break-induced
  replication (BIR), in which the 3′ DNA overhang invades homologous double-stranded
  telomeric DNA of another chromosome, leading to the formation of a DNA displacement
  loop (D-loop). The invading strand then serves as the primer for the initiation
  of DNA replication.'
