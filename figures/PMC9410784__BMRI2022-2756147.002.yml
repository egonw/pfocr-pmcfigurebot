caption: Modeling the mechanism by which PM2.5 exposure caused MAPK pathway activation
  and GCs resistance. PM2.5 mediates abnormal activation of downstream signaling pathways,
  including NF-ÎºB, MAPK, and PI3K pathways, leading to inflammatory damage, decreased
  cell viability, increased cell death, and GC treatment resistance, resulting in
  increased severity of asthma.
