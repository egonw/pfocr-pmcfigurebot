caption: 'TLR4 inhibition attenuated SFA- and n-6 PUFA-mediated activation of NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD
  signaling. The relative protein expression of collagen II, TLR4, p-NF-κB, and IL-1β
  in SW1353 cells treated with PA (a) or LA (b). The relative protein expression of
  NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD in SW1353 cells treated with PA (c) or LA (d). Immunofluorescent
  staining was used to detect the expression of caspase-1 (e, g) and GSDMD (f, h)
  in SW1353 cells treated with PA or LA (200x, scale bars = 100 μm). The data are
  presented as the means ± SD, n = 3. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus the CON group;
  #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus the groups without CLI-095-pretreatment; ^p < 0.05
  and ^^p < 0.01 versus the LPS group; &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 versus the PA or LA
  group.'
