caption: 'PBX3 regulates glucose metabolism. A. Viability of PBX3-knocked down HCT116
  cells. B. Colony formation potential of PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells. Representative
  images (left) and quantification results (right; n = 6) are shown. C-D. Glucose
  consumption (C) and lactate production (D) levels in PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells.
  E. mRNA expression levels of glucose metabolism-related genes in PBX3-knocked down
  HCT116 cells, as analyzed using qRT-PCR. F-G. G6PD protein expression levels in
  PBX3-knocked down (F) and PBX3-overexpressed (G) tumor cells, as examined using
  western blotting. H-I. G6PD activity in PBX3-knocked down (H) and PBX3-overexpressed
  (I) tumor cells. Cells transfected with shCon or pcCon were used as control. β-actin
  was used for qRT-PCR normalization and as western blotting loading control. Total
  protein was used for normalizing the levels of glucose consumption, lactate production,
  and G6PD activity. Quantification data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3; unless otherwise
  indicated). pcCon: pcEF9-Puro; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; NS: not significant.'
