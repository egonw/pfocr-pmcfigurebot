caption: Licoricidin suppressed MGC-803 cell metastasis. MGC-803 cells were treated
  with licoricidin (5, 10, and 20 μM) or 5-fluorouracil 20 μM for 24 h. Representative
  images of cell migration (A) and invasion (B) in each group were detected by transwell
  experiments (×200). The number of migrated (D) or invaded (E) cells passing through
  the membrane in each well was counted from five random fields of view and analyzed
  as the mean ± SD. (C,F) Comparison of wound healing areas of MGC-803 cells treated
  with indicated concentration for 24 h (×200). The parts circled in yellow lines
  represent areas where the cells had not yet migrated to fill. (G) Expression levels
  of MMP2 and MMP9 were assessed by Western blot analysis and normalized by β-actin
  for quantitative analysis. Results are displayed as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. LCD, licoricidin.
  5-FU, 5-fluorouracil. Scale bar, 100 μm.
