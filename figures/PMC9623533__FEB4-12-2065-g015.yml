caption: 'Excessive level of ER stress combined with CHOP silencing affects the PERK
  pathway on protein level. CHOP was silenced, then a high level of ER stress (10 μm
  thapsigargin for 2 h) was induced in HEK293T cells and then the cells were denoted
  in time. Control samples were not treated with any reagent (including DMSO). (upper
  panel) The markers of PERK pathway (i.e. eIF2α‐P, ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34) were followed
  by immunoblotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control. The full‐length blots
  are included in the . (lower panel) Densitometry data represent the intensity of
  ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34 normalized for GAPDH, while eIF2α‐P normalized for total
  level of eIF2α. For each of the experiments, three complete biological repeat experiments
  were carried out. Error bars represent standard deviation. In the calculation of
  statistical significance, data from CHOP‐silenced samples were compared to the nonsilenced
  samples with the corresponding treatment time of 10 μm thapsigargin (e.g. CHOP‐silenced
  control was compared to nonsilenced control, and thapsigargin‐treated samples with
  the combination of CHOP‐silencing were compared to the nonsilenced samples treated
  with thapsigargin for the same period of time). Results are presented as mean values ± SD
  and were compared using ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple comparison post hoc test. Asterisks
  indicate statistically significant difference from the appropriate control: *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01. TG, thapsigargin.'
