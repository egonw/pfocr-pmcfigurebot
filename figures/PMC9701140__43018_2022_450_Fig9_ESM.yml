figure_title: Responders have an increase in genes and pathways associated with inflammation
caption: (A) Significant HALLMARK pathways that differed between responders and non-responders
  at baseline (non-responders n = 5 patients, responders n = 8 patients). (B) Gene
  mapping analysis of significant pathways increased in responders and non-responders
  at baseline using significant genes identified in GO biological and KEGG pathway
  analysis. Red clusters are increased in responders at baseline and blue clusters
  are increased in non-responders at baseline (non-responders n = 5 patients, responders
  n = 8 patients). (C) Significant HALLMARK pathways that differed between responders
  and non-responders post-treatment (non-responders n = 5 patients, responders n = 8
  patients). (D) MultiPLIER cell type analysis of the RNA sequencing data (non-responders
  n = 5 patients, responders n = 8 patients) (LV964 non-responders p = 0.63 and responders
  p = 0.0024; LV823 non-responders p = 0.07 and responders p = 0.0059; LV31 non-responders
  p = 0.88 and responders p = 0.007; LV765 non-responders p = 0.28 and responders
  p = 0.001; LV96 non-responders p = 0.59 and responders = 0.0025). (E) Representative
  graphs depicting TCR clone expansion of the top 10 clones for two patients, a responder
  (01-009) and a non-responder (01-007). (F) Scatterplot with annotations depicting
  clones with more than 8 transcripts before and after treatment for patients 01-002
  and 01-007. Light grey dots were not included in the analysis because they had less
  than 8 sequences. Dark grey dots are clones that were not significantly different
  between pre- and post-samples. Red dots were clones significantly increased pre-treatment
  and blue dots were clones that were significantly increased post-treatment. Dots
  along the Y and X axis are clones not present in the pre-sample or post-sample,
  respectively. Analysis was conducted using the ImmunoSEQ analyzer. (G) Quantification
  of PD-L1 expressing cancer cells (CK+) within the TME pre- and post-treatment (non-responders
  n = 6 patients, responders n = 12 patients). Non-responders p = 0.36 and responders
  p = 0.26. (H) Quantification of CPS score (12 Gy n = 2 patients, 18 Gy n = 3 patients,
  and 24 Gy n = 3 patients) and PD-L1+ cells (12 Gy n = 2 patients, 18 Gy n = 5 patients,
  24 Gy n = 6 patients) in the TME post-treatment by VECTRA categorized by dose of
  SBRT given to the patient. Significance was determined by a two-way paired student’s
  t-test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. The error bars represent the standard
  error of the mean (± SEM).
