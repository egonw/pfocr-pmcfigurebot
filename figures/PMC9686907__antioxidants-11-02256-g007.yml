caption: 'Effect of CSLW on the activation of the EPK−MAPK and Nrf2 signaling pathways
  in HNEpCs. (A–C) Cells were treated with CSLW (1, 3, and 10 μg/mL) or with NAC (10
  mM) along with IL−4/IL−13 (15 ng/mL) for 1 h. (A–C) Expressions of phospho−ERK (p−ERK),
  ERK, Keap1, HO−1, NQO1, SOD1, Nrf2, and PCNA were evaluated using Western blot analysis.
  Total β−Actin or PCNA was used to confirm equal sample loading. Images from Western
  blotting were quantified using ImageJ software. The data are presented as the means
  values ± SD; * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control cells; # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 compared with the IL-4/IL-13-treated cells.
  CSLW, Caesalpinia sappan Linn. heartwood water extract; HNEpCs, human nasal epithelial
  cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2−related
  factor 2.'
