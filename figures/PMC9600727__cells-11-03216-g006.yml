caption: 'Signalling pathways and biological processes affected in spheroids treated
  with 45 μM palmitic acid and 65 μM oleic acid (FA) compared to the Control of standard
  growth media. (A) Summary of the dependencies between the significantly regulated
  proteins and their role in DNA and protein regulation, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition and known markers of NAFLD phenotype in patients. The network was created
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and BioRender tools. Circles indicate the following:
  Black-proteins significantly regulated FDR < 0.05; green-upregulated > 1.2-fold,
  red circles-downregulated > 1.2-fold, grey-not changing based on the proteomics
  data, white-not measured in this study, circled by dotted line-measured using qPCR.
  Full arrows indicate direct relation. Dotted arrows indicate indirect relations.
  Pointed arrows indicate activation. Blunt arrows indicate repression. Relative gene
  expression of (B) CDH1 (E-cadherin), (C) CDH2 (N-cadherin), and (D) a-SMA (alpha-smooth
  muscle actin) was measured by qPCR after 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of treatment. * statistically
  significant difference according to Student’s t-test and Holm–Sidak post hoc test,
  p < 0.05, n = 3. Error bars show the standard error of the mean.'
