caption: ZQL-4c induces G2/M phase arrest in breast cancer cells. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
  and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 μmol/L ZQL-4c for 24 h.
  (a) Cells were fixed and stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. (b) The
  percentage of cells in the G2/M phase is shown in the histogram. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard error of the mean of three independent experiments performed
  in triplicate (n = 3; ∗P < 0.05). (c) The protein levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D1,
  p21, and p27 were detected by western blotting. Actin was used as a loading control.
