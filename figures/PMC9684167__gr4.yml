caption: GST characterization of male gonadal cellsA. Combined analysis of fetal,
  neonatal, and adult male germ cells by PCA. The cells are colored by cell type and
  developmental stage. B. Bar plot showing the developmental stage distribution of
  three male FGCs. The color represents developmental stage. C. Violin plot showing
  the trajectory expression patterns in male germ cells from fetal (6–23 W), neonatal,
  and adult testes. D. Immunostaining of the germ cell marker DDX4, the BMP signaling
  pathway component p-SMAD1/5/9, and a BMP signaling pathway target ID1 in fetal testes
  (9 W, 14 W, and 22 W). Cells inside the white squares are magnified and shown on
  the right of the corresponding images. The white square with symbol “a” highlights
  the germ cells that expressed p-SMAD1/5/9 in the nucleus, while the white square
  with symbol “b” highlights the germ cells that expressed p-SMAD1/5/9 in the cytoplasm.
  Neo, neonatal; D2, day 2 after birth; D7, day 7 after birth; SPG, spermatogonium;
  SPC, spermatocyte; ST, spermatid; GST, gonocyte-to-spermatogonium transition.
