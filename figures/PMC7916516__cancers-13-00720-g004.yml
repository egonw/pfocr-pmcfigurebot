caption: Pathway analysis performed using the altered metabolites from metabolomics
  data for gastric cancer. Each filled circle corresponds to a metabolic pathway.
  The x-coordinate (Pathway Impact) indicates the extent of pathway influence by the
  perturbed metabolites. The point size is related to the diversity of the pathway,
  based on the number of metabolites contained in the pathway. The ordinate represents
  the negative logarithm of the p-value obtained from the enrichment analysis done
  by the MetaboAnalyst software. The p-value (measure of pathway importance) is encoded
  in the color of the circles with red being the highest p-value.
