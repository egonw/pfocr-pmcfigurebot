caption: Gypenosides suppress the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (a and b) RT-qPCR analysis
  of T24 and 5637 cells expressing the PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Cells were pretreated
  with DMSO or gypenosides. Student's t-test, mean ± SD are given, ∗P < 0.05. (c)
  Immunoblot assay displaying the expression of proteins in 5637 and T24 cells. (d)
  Quantification of protein expression level. Two-way ANOVA. Error bars, mean ± SD.
  ∗P < 0.05.
