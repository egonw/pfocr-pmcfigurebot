caption: Evolutionary outcome of the amanitin biosynthesis pathway in mushrooms. The
  modes of nutrition, mycorrhizal symbiosis, wood decomposition, and soil saprotroph
  are indicated below the genomes. Within the representative genomes for Amanita,
  Galerina, and Lepiota, predicted genes are indicated as blue lines, GC content as
  red lines, and GC skew as black lines. Four toxin biosynthetic genes are color-labeled
  to show their respective arrangements in the genomes. Genetic distances of the biosynthetic
  genes are similarly color-coded as lines connecting genome circles (housekeeping
  rpb2 indicated as black lines). The thick red arrows represent the best hypothesis
  from comprehensive evaluations.
