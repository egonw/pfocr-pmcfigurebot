caption: Characteristics of the cells. (A) The fibroblast-like morphology cells could
  be observed at day 7 in both groups. Cells reach 80 % confluence in day 17 with
  fibroblast-like morphology. (B)The surface marker expression of both groups of cells
  showed positive expression in CD73 and CD90, and negative expression in CD34 and
  CD45.
