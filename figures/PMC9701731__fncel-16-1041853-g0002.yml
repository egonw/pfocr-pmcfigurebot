caption: Secreted proteins are trafficked to the cell surface via multiple distinct
  pathways. After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), proteins destined for
  exocytosis undergo processing in the Golgi before being sorted into intracellular
  transport vesicles in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Transport vesicles leaving
  the TGN can either be targeted directly to the plasma membrane to undergo regulated
  or constitutive exocytosis or be transported to the endosomal pathway, either for
  further sorting prior to exocytosis or to deliver endosome specific cargo. Proteins
  that are retrieved from the cell surface are targeted to early endosomes (EE) which
  act as sorting platforms in endosomal traffic to and from the membrane. EEs can
  mature into late endosomes (LE) which act as a final sorting station for proteins
  destined for lysosomal degradation. LEs can also mature into multi-vesicular bodies
  (MVB) which can alternatively fuse with the plasma membrane to facilitate exosome
  release. Small arrowheads indicate the direction of vesicle traffic.
