figure_title: Keap1-Nrf2 signaling drives invasiveness of Lgl-KD multilayers
caption: '(A) Representative confocal images of ovarioles containing egg chambers
  with transgene expression in follicle cells (green) driving Lgl-KD (top), Lgl-KD+Cnc-KD
  (middle), and Lgl-KD+Keap1-KD (bottom panels). Degenerating egg chambers are marked
  by asterisks (*). Border cell migration defects are indicated by arrowheads. Nucleus
  is marked by DAPI (white). F-actin is marked by Phalloidin (red). Scale bars: 20
  µm. (B) Box-and-whisker plot showing the quantification of phenotypic rescue at
  early (red), mid (blue), and late (green) oogenesis. For the multilayering phenotype
  at midoogenesis, we have only counted instances of >2 follicular layers. (C) Bar
  plot showing relative expression levels of genes involved in the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling
  pathway in relevant genotypes (N = minimum 10 pairs of ovaries). Samples are color-coded
  as shown in legend and the error bars represent Standard Error (SE). (D) Confocal
  images of ovarioles with Lgl-KD+Keap1-OE (above) and Lgl-KD+CncC-OE (below) in follicle
  cells (green). Arrowheads mark the epithelial bridging or fusion phenotype. Nucleus
  is marked by DAPI (white). F-actin is marked by Phalloidin (red). Scale bars, 20
  µm. Figure 5—source data 1.Quantification of the rescue of stage-specific Lgl-KD
