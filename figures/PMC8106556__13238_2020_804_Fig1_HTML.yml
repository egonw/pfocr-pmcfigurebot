caption: The mechanism of activation of alternative pathway by exogenous molecules
  and endogenous BAs. Oral administration of exogenous molecules suppresses the activity
  of intestinal BSH enzymes, and causes accumulation of predominantly conjugated non-12-OH
  BAs. Meanwhile, endogenous conjugated or unconjugated CDCA or UDCA could increase
  the abundance of non-12-OH BAs directly or indirectly (via enterohepatic circulation).
  These BAs inhibit intestinal FXR and therefore, downstream FGF15/19-FGFR4 signaling
  resulting in upregulation of the hepatic BA synthesis genes CYP7A1, CYP8B1, CYP27A1
  and CYP7B1 in both classical and alternative pathways. Meanwhile, hepatic FXR expression
  as well as downstream SHP signaling is increased and the BA synthetic enzymes are
  inhibited, mainly CYP8B1, in the classical pathway. Ultimately, the combined regulation
  of intestinal FXR-FGF15 and hepatic FXR-SHP on hepatic BA synthesis results in increased
  expression of CYP7B1 in the alternative pathway. The metabolites, proteins, and
  pathways in blue indicate their down-regulation, whereas in red indicate up-regulation
  after oral treatment of exogenous and endogenous agents
