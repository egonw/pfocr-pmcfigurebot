figure_title: 'Figure 1. PLA affects root growth via auxin signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.
  (A) Relative primary root length and (B) lateral root density of Col-0 and tir1-1
  afb2 seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 0, 50, 100, or 200 µM D-PLA
  or L-PLA for 14 days. Primary root length is reported relative to each control.
  Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD) (n=4). (C) Photographs of the seedlings
  grown for 14 days on D-PLA-containing medium. Bar: 20 mm. (D) GUS staining of primary
  root tips of pIAA19:GUS reporter seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium in the presence
  or absence of exogenous 200 µM D-PLA for 14 days. Bar: 0.1 mm. (E) Growth recovery
  analysis of the IAA biosynthesis mutant wei8-1 tar2-1 grown on 1/2 MS medium in
  the presence or absence of exogenous 200 µM D-PLA for 14 days. Asterisks indicate
  wei8-1 tar2-1 doubly homogenous mutant seedlings. Bar: 20 mm'
