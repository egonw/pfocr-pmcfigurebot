caption: 'Inhibitory effects of FCP, SB203580 (A), SP600125 (B), and U0126 (C) on
  cisplatin-induced activation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK signaling pathway in TECs.
  The expression of p-p38 MAPK, p-JNK, and p-ERK was increased in cisplatin-treated
  TECs. The pretreatment of TECs with FCP, SB203580 (A), SP600125 (B), and U0126 (C)
  blocked the cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK. Results
  are presented as the means ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001 vs. the control. ### p < 0.001 vs. the cisplatin alone-treated group.'
