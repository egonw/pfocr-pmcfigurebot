caption: 'Overview of the Hh signalling pathway in vertebrates. A) Activated canonical
  Hh signalling pathway involves [] Hh ligands binds to PTCH1 [] leading to its internalisation
  and proteolytic degradation, which activates SMO []. The phosphorylation of SMO
  causes a conformational change that promotes its stabilisation and translocation
  to the primary cilium, where it stimulates Gi protein activity []. SMO activity
  in the primary cilium allows the release of sequestered GLI (GLI2/3) from an inhibitory
  complex with SUFU (5; mediated by KIF7) and [] the active full length transcriptional
  activator GLI2/3 relocate to the nucleus to [] regulate the expression of Hh target
  genes, including GLI1, PTCH1, and RUNX2 []. B) Examples of the SMO-dependent non-canonical
  activation of Hh signalling pathway. C) Activation of GLI1 via cross-talk with other
  pathways, e.g. TGFβ and MAPK/ERK signalling pathways. D) The structure of the primary
  cilium. Abbreviations: Hh, Hedgehog; P, phosphorylation; SMO, Smoothened; PTCH1,
  Patched1; Cdon/Cdo, cell adhesion molecule-related/down-regulated by oncogenes;
  Gas1, growth arrest-specific gene1; Boc, brother of Cdon; SUFU, suppressor of fused;
  KIF7, kinesin family member7 motor protein; IFT complex, intraflagellar transport
  A and B; RUNX2, runt-related transcription factor 2; GLI1, glioma-associated oncogene
  homolog 1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinases; TGFβ, transforming growth factor beta; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  PLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A subclass 2. [Created with BioRender.com].'
