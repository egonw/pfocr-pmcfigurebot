caption: The E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation
  of key factors from BMP/TGF-β pathway, NF-κB pathway, MAPK pathway, and other pathways,
  thereby regulating osteogenic differentiation. Notably, these pathways interconnected
  with each other and formed a complex regulatory network.
