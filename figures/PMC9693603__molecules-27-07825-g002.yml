caption: Effect of azilsartan on apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
  lines estimated with Annexin V staining. (A,C) Representative dot plots for MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, respectively. (B,D) The percentage of total
  apoptotic cells in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, respectively,
  after treatment with the IC50 of azilsartan for 48 h. Data represent mean Â± SD,
  n =3. Significant difference was analyzed by one-way ANOVA test, where *** p < 0.001,
  compared to untreated cells.
