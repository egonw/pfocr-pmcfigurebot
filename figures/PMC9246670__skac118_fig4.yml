caption: 'Effect of heat stress on the ratio of phosphorylated JAK-STAT pathway proteins.
  The relative ratio of (A) pJAK2Tyr1007/1008:JAK2, (B) pSTAT3Tyr705:STAT3, (C) pSTAT5α/βTyr694/699:STAT5α
  during the luteal phase and (D) pSTAT5α/βTyr694/699:STAT5α during the follicular
  phase ± SEM is presented; †P < 0.10. Abbreviations: pJAK2Tyr1007/1008, phosphorylated
  janus kinase 2 tyrosine 1007/1008; pSTAT3Tyr705, phosphorylated signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 tyrosine 705; pSTAT5α/βTyr694/699, phosphorylated
  signal transducer and activator of transcription α/β tyrosine 694/699; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; STAT5α, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 5α.'
