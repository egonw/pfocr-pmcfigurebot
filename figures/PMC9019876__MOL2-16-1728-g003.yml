caption: DCZ0415 increases immune infiltration in an immunocompetent model. (A) Western
  blot analysis to show the expression of GZMB and TRIP13 in protein lysates of CRC
  cells exhibiting TRIP13 knockdown (B) Photographs of syngeneic mouse tumours generated
  by implanting MC38 cells into C57/BL6 mice after treatment with vehicle and DCZ0415
  (n = 5). (C) Tumour weights are shown for vehicle‐ and DCZ0415‐treated tumours (error
  bar indicates mean ± SD, *P = 0.008). (D) Kinetics of tumour growth treated with
  vehicle and DCZ0415 (error bar indicates mean ± SD, P = 0.01). (E) Dot plot showing
  tumour growth in vehicle‐ and DCZ0415‐treated mice at day 26 (error bar indicates
  mean ± SD, *P = 0.01). (F) H&E and IHC analysis to show the infiltration of immune
  cells and expression of T‐cell markers in DCZ0415‐treated immunocompetent tumours,
  Scale bar‐ 20 µm. Arrows indicate positive staining. (G) qPCR analysis to show the
  levels of PD1 and CTLA4 in DCZ0415‐treated tumours, relative to vehicle control
  (error bar indicates mean ± SD; P = 0.031 and P = 0.26 respectively). (H) Protein
  levels of GZMB, perforin, PD1, IFN‐γ and TRIP13 are shown in vehicle‐ and DCZ0415‐treated
  tumours.
