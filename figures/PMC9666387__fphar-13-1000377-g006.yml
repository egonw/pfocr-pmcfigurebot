caption: 'The effect of sodium cantharidate (SCA) on breast cancer cells is related
  to the PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of the levels
  of PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway-related proteins in SCA-treated breast cancer cells for
  24 h. (B) Western blot analysis of autophagy-related proteins affected by SCA and
  MHY1485 alone or in combination. (C) Fluorescence microscopy images of CYTO-ID-stained
  breast cancer cells after treatment with SCA and MHY1485 alone or in combination
  for 24 h (×400), scale bar: 2 µm. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 compared with the control group).'
