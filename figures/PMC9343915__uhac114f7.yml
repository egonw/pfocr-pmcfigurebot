caption: Simplified schematic diagram of the biosynthesis of the main specialized
  metabolites stored or secreted by C. miniata floral cells. Major pathway names are
  shown in blue and key enzymes characterized in the present study in red; stored
  or secreted anthocyanins, carotenoids, and terpenes are on a red, yellow and gray
  background, respectively. Metabolic routes are projected onto the subcellular localizations
  of the enzymes either characterized in the present study or referred to in other
  studies. Solid arrows indicate established biochemical reactions. Dotted arrows
  indicate hypothetical reactions. A single arrow does not necessarily represent a
  single enzymatic conversion. Arrow thickness indicates the relative content of metabolic
  flux at the bifurcation. MVA, mevalonate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP,
