caption: 'Systems biology analysis in MN. IPA of the 49 significant differentially
  expressed MN-associated proteins was conducted to identify key upstream regulators
  (a,b) and biological function associations (c,d) enriched in patients with MN. (a)
  List of the most significant upstream regulators that best explain the observed
  expression changes in MN versus N and MCD. (b) A total of 4 significant upstream
  regulators (EGFR, IL-6, TGFB1, IL-4) and the MN-associated proteins predicted to
  be downstream of these upstream regulators. IPA color and symbol guide: blue, inhibition;
  orange, activation; red, increased; green, decreased; yellow, contrary to published
  evidence; gray, unknown; dashed line, indirect; arrowhead (pointed), activating;
  arrowhead (blunt), inhibitory. (c) List of the most significant biological functions
  that best explain the observed expression changes in MN versus N and MCD. (d). A
  total of 5 significant classes of biological functions enriched among the MN-associated
  49-protein signature. IL, interleukin; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; MCD, minimal
  change disease; MN, membranous nephropathy; N, healthy controls.'
