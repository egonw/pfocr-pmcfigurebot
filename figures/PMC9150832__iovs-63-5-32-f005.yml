caption: Downregulation of the PPARα pathway was involved in cyp4v7/cyp4v8 DKO zebrafish
  RPE cells. (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in cyp4v7−/−cyp4v8−/−
  zebrafish compared with WT. (B) KEGG circle enrichment analysis of the differentially
  expressed genes. The first lap indicates the top 20 KEGG terms. The second lap represents
  the gene numbers in the genome backdrop. The third circle represents the ratio of
  the upregulated genes (dark purple) and downregulated genes (light purple). The
  fourth circle represents the enrichment element of each KEGG term. (C) KEGG enriched
  metabolism pathways (P < 0.05) are shown. (D) Expression patterns of genes in PPARα
  signaling pathway in WT and cyp4v7−/−cyp4v8−/− zebrafish RPE cells are shown in
  the heatmap. (E) Validation of the expression of genes in PPARα pathway by qPCR
  in cyp4v7 and cyp4v8 DKO zebrafish RPE cells at seven months after fertilization.
  (F) Detection of the protein level of PPARα in WT and cyp4v7−/−cyp4v8−/− zebrafish
  RPE cells by Western blot. The results are shown as mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001; **P
  < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
