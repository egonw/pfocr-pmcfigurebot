figure_title: The expression analysis of the key gene SCD in AMD in pan-cancer
caption: (A) The GEPIA online database was used to analyze the expression level of
  SCD in different types of human cancer and normal tissues. The results showed that
  SCD was differentially expressed in tumor tissue and normal tissue. Compared with
  adjacent normal tissues, the expression of SCD in BLCA, CESC, COAD, DLBC, KICH,
  KIRC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, PAAD, PRAD, READ, SKCM, STAD, THYM, UCEC and UCS was significantly
  up-regulated. However, in LAML, the expression of SCD was significantly down-regulated.
