caption: (A) The graph represented significant increase in cholesterol (mg/dl) in
  injury group at 21 W (B) Triglycerides concentration was increased significantly
  at 7 W and 21 W injury groups compared to their respective VC groups. The graphical
  data presented in mean ± S.D. whereas Significant level was considered as p < 0.05,
  p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001 (C) Histological architecture of liver showing
  micro-vesicular steatosis (Red arrow) and lipo-granulomas (Black arrow) in injury
  group at14W. macro-vesicular steatosis (Orange arrow) and Mallory’s bodies (Blue
  arrow) was observed in injury groups at 21 W (20X microphotographs).
