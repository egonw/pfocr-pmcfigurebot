caption: 'Immunoblotting bands (a) and statistical analysis (b) of MST1, LATS1, YAP1,
  TEAD1, and β-actin for: 1, GP; 2, LP; 3, DP. The relative abundance of target proteins
  at each stage was expressed as the ratio of the measured intensity of MST1, LATS1,
  YAP1, TEAD1 protein, and β-Actin protein (target protein/β-actin). **, the expression
  of the same protein was significantly different at different periods (p < 0.01).'
