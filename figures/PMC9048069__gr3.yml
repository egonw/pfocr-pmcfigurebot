caption: The EGFR→MEK→ERK kinase pathway is necessary for mutant EGFR-driven BTC expression(A)
  NIH3T3-DEL1 cells were treated with either DMSO or 10 or 100 nM of erlotinib for
  6 h. Indicated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading
  control.(B) NIH3T3-DEL1cells were treated with DMSO or erlotinib (10 or 100 nM)
  for 6 h. Relative mRNA expression for the indicated genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR
  and plotted relative to that of DMSO-treated NIH3T3-DEL1 cells.(C) PC9 cells were
  treated with DMSO or erlotinib (10 or 100 nM) for 6 h. Indicated proteins were analyzed
  by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading control.(D) PC9 cells were treated
  with DMSO or erlotinib (10 or 100 nM) for 6 h. Relative mRNA expression for the
  indicated genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR and plotted relative to that of DMSO treated
  PC9 cells.(E) NIH3T3-DEL1 cells were treated with DMSO or trametinib (250 nM) for
  24 h. Indicated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as a loading
  control.(F) NIH3T3-DEL1 cells were treated with DMSO or trametinib (250 nM) for
  24 h. Relative Btc mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and plotted relative
  to that of DMSO-treated NIH3T3-DEL1 cells.(G) PC9 cells were treated with DMSO or
  trametinib (250 nM) for 24 h. Indicated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.
  ACTB was used as a loading control.(H) PC9 cells were treated with DMSO or trametinib
  (250 nM) for 24 h. Relative BTC mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and plotted
  relative to that of DMSO-treated PC9 cells.(I) NIH3T3 cells expressing either empty
  vector or constitutively active MEK (MEK-DD) were analyzed for the indicated proteins.
  ACTB was used as a loading control.(J) Relative Btc mRNA expression in NIH3T3 cells
  expressing either empty vector or MEK-DD were analyzed by RT-qPCR and plotted relative
  to empty vector-expressing NIH3T3 cells. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, ns =
  not significant, ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001. See also .
