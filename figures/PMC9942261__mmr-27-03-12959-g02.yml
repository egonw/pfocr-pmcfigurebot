caption: miR-29a-3p inhibits HIF-1α expression by targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  (A) A schematic diagram of the binding site of miR-29a-3p to the PI3K gene and the
  PI3K mutation site was predicted by TargetScan. (B) Dual luciferase gene reporter
  assay was used to verify the targeting negative regulatory effect of miR-29a-3p
  on PI3K, ****P<0.0001. The expression level of PI3K was analyzed by (C) quantitative
  PCR and (D) western blotting after U251 cells were transfected with miR-29a-3p mimics
  and inhibitor, *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. (E) Effect of miR-29a-3p on the expression levels
  of the PI3K downstream molecules AKT, p-AKT and HIF-1α, *P<0.05, **P<0.01. All data
  were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). miR, microRNA; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1; NC, negative control; UTR, 3′ untranslated region; wt, wild-type; mu,
  mutant; p-, phosphorylated.
