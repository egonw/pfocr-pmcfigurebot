caption: 'PUE regulated the oxidative stress level in the MCAO/R model. (A–F) The
  levels of ROS, SOD, MDA, GSH, GSH-px, and CAT in the brain tissues were measured
  by the corresponding kits. All data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). ##p < 0.01
  vs. sham group, *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. model group, △p < 0.05 or △△p < 0.01
  vs. PUE group.'
