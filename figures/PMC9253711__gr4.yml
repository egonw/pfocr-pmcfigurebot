caption: LncNSPL suppresses RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production and promotes IAV
  replication(A) Expression of IFN-β, IL-6, and IL-1β at mRNA levels in PMA-differentiated
  THP-1 macrophages transfected with control siRNA (siNC) or siRNA targeting lncNSPL
  (silncNSPL) for 48 h, and subsequently infected with H1N1 for indicated time (∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(B) ELISA results showing the protein levels of IFN-β,
  IL-6, and IL-1β in the supernatants of THP-1 cells transfected with siNC or silncNSPL
  for 48 h before H1N1 infection for 12 h (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(C)
  The level of viral NP expression was analyzed by Western blot in THP-1 cells transfected
  with siNC or silncNSPL for 48 h and infected with H1N1 for the indicated time periods
  (0-16h). Actin as an internal control.(D) Fluorescence microscopy images of viral
  replication (green, PR8-GFP) in siNC or silncNSPL-transfected THP-1 cells infected
  with GFP-tagged H1N1 for 12 h. Data are representative of three independent experiments
  (n = 3 technical replicates).(E) Apoptosis was measured by PI-Annexin V FACS assay
  in A549 cells co-cultured with the supernatant of siNC or silncNSPL-transfected
  THP-1 cells infected with H1N1 for 12h.(F and G) NF-κB (F) and IFN-β (G) promoter
  activities were measured in HEK293T cells transfected with lncNSPL of different
  doses and RIG-I vectors followed by H1N1 infection (∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(H)
  Western blot showing the levels of key proteins in the RIG-I signaling pathway in
  THP-1 cells stably transfected with control shRNA (sh-NC) or shRNA targeting lncNSPL
  (sh-lncNSPL) and infected with H1N1 for the indicated time periods (0-16 h).
