caption: Pirfenidone inhibits damage to RLE-6TN cells by inhibiting bleomycin through
  the STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) The MTT assay results demonstrated that cell viability
  was significantly reduced after the addition of bleomycin; when pirfenidone was
  added at the same time, cell viability was significantly restored; and cell viability
  was further increased after Stattic was added (P<0.05); (B,C) RT-PCR was used to
  detect the expression of STAT3 and KL-6. The results show that when bleomycin was
  added, the expression of STAT3 and KL-6 significantly increased. When the cells
  were treated with pirfenidone, the expression of STAT3 and KL-6 was further reduced
  (P<0.05). (D,E) ELISAs were used to detect the expression of TNF-α and E-cadherin,
  and the results demonstrated that the expression of TNF-α and E-cadherin significantly
  increased when bleomycin was added. When the cells were treated with pirfenidone,
  the expression of TNF-α and E-cadherin was significantly reduced (P<0.05), but no
  significant change in TNF-α expression was found after the addition of Stattic (P>0.05),
  and the expression of E-cadherin was further reduced (P<0.05). **, P<0.05. NTC,
