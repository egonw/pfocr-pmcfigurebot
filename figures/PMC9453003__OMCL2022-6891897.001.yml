caption: A summary of p38 MAPK signalling in sex determination in mice. (a) A diagrammatic
  representation of the sex fate decision of Sertoli cells. At around 10.5 dpc, p38
  MAPK is activated by the GADD45γ/MAP3K4/MAP2K6 pathway. Then, p-p38 MAPK activates
  GATA4 by phosphorylation and subsequent expression of SRY. SRY upregulates SOX9
  and FGF9 expression to induce differentiation into Sertoli cells (black arrows).
  At 12.5 dpc, testis cords have formed and morphological differences between the
  testis (blue) and the ovary (pink) are evident. Both inhibition and overactivation
  of p38 MAPK cause delayed onset and reduced expression of SRY, which permits WNT4
  and RSPO1 to express in a female-specific manner, inducing ovarian development (red
  arrows). (b) A schema for the sex fate decision of XY PGCs. In XY gonads, the SRY-SOX9-FGF9
  pathway prevents XY PGCs from differentiating into female germ cells by blocking
  the network of RA/STRA8 through CYP26B1. p38 MAPK signalling is activated in PGCs
  of XY gonads around E11.5 dpc and induces the expression of Nanos2. Nanos2 inhibits
  the expression of STRA8 to block PGCs from entering meiosis and promotes a male
  differentiation in XY PGCs (black arrows). The inhibition of p38 MAPK permits the
  expression of STRA8 in PGCs (red arrows).
