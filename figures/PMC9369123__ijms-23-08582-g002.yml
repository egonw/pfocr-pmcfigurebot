caption: Mechanism of DAGâ€“PKC activation. Hyperglycaemia induces mainly the de novo
  pathway of DAG synthesis from glucose to glycerol 3-phosphate with subsequent PKC
  activation. ROS, reactive oxygen species; DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; FDP, fructose 1,6-diphosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; lysoPA, lysophosphatidic
  acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase. Arrows represent the subsequent event/product in the pathway; red arrow
  represents increased production.
