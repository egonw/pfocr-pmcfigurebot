caption: Neu amplification status is associated with differential WNT signalling and
  activation of the epidermal differentiation cluster. (A) Log2 relative expression
  of genes on M. musculus chromosome 3 significantly differentially expressed between
  not/low-amplified and high-amplified tumours. Genes are plotted by their relative
  expression levels (x-axis) and their chromosomal location (y-axis) (Table S14).
  A cluster of genes is highly expressed in the not/low-amplified tumours immediately
  before base position 1×108 (red rectangle), suggesting co-regulation. This region
  is expanded below and the genes annotated. This is the epidermal differentiation
  cluster, and includes genes associated with epithelial keratinization. (B) Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering of Log2 FPKM data for genes of interest identified by functional
  annotation (mmu04310:Wnt signalling pathway, GO:0016055∼Wnt signalling pathway,
  GO:0060070∼canonical Wnt signalling pathway, GO:0090090∼negative regulation of canonical
  Wnt signalling pathway, GO:0090263∼positive regulation of canonical Wnt signalling
  pathway, mmu04012:ErbB signalling pathway, GO:0030216∼keratinocyte differentiation
  and GO:0031424∼keratinization) (see ). Neu amplification status (by qPCR), parity,
  histotype are indicated. The GO/KEGG annotations of each gene are indicated.
