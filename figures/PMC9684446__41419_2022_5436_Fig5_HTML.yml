figure_title: LINC00924 regulates the P38/PPARα signaling pathway via hnRNPC regulated
  Mnk2 pre-mRNA AS
caption: 'A Heatmap presenting significantly differentially expressed transcripts
  between MGC803-NC and LINC00924-OE cell lines. B A schematic model of Mnk2 AS. MNK2
  pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to yield two isoforms: Mnk2a and Mnk2b. Mnk2a
  contains e14a, a binding site for MAP kinases, while Mnk2b does not []. C The correlations
  of LINC00924 expression with Mnk2b (B) and Mnk2a (C) expression in GC tissues. D
  RT–PCR analysis of Mnk2a and Mnk2b in MGC803-NC and LINC-OE cell lines and in AGS-NC
  and LINC-KD cell lines. E Schematic illustration of base pairing between LINC00924
  and the e14a of Mnk2. F qRT–PCR detection of e14a enrichment by LINC00924 using
  a RAP assay. G RT–PCR analysis of MGC803-NC and LINC-OE cell lines treated with
  si-hnRNPC or NC. H hnRNPC knockdown did not disrupt the RNA–RNA duplex formed by
  LINC00924 and e14a. I RIP analysis conducted using an anti-hnRNPC antibody to validate
  the interaction between hnRNPC and the e14a of Mnk2. J LINC00924 is essential for
  the formation of the RNA–RNA duplex by LINC00924 and e14a.'
