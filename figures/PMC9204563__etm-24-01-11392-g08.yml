caption: Pathway analysis based on metabolic profiling of raw RWI products. A total
  of 20 metabolites were identified from the nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic
  profiling analysis. The metabolic pathways are either labeled in the plot or indicated
  at the bottom. The pathway significance (y-axis) was based on the pathway enrichment
  algorithm and is indicated by the intensity of the color shading, and the pathway
  impact (x-axis) was determined by the pathway topology analysis and is indicated
  by the diameter of the circle representing the pathway. RWI, Radix Wikstroemia indica
