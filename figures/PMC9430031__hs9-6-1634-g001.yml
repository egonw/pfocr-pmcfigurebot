caption: Both chidamide and ABT-199 significantly inhibited the cell proliferation
  of CEM and Molt4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of chidamide
  with ABT-199 significantly increases the rate of cell proliferation arrest (Fig.
  A), and apoptosis (Fig. B) compared to the single drug control in both cell lines.
  Also, the chidamide alone or combined treatment significantly induced the G0/G1
  phase arrest in the cells (Fig. C). Moreover, the Combination of chidamide with
  ABT-199 induced the up-regulation of apoptotic proteins, Bax and cleaved caspase-3,
  and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 compared to that of either
  single drug control (Fig. D). Similarly, chidamide alone or combined treatment induced
  the up-regulation of cell cycle regulatory protein, p21 in the cells (Fig. E). We
  also analyzed the pathway enrichment based on network pharmacology from T-ALL treated
  with chidamide and ABT -199 and found the PI3K/AKT is significantly enriched upon
  the drug treatment (Fig. F). Western blot results also showed that the combination
  treatment significantly down-regulated expression of PI3K and AKT, also the AKT
  phosphorylation (Fig. G).
