caption: DEC1 regulates Akt/NF‐κB pathway in H. pylori‐infected GC cells. A. GSEA
  of GSE62254 data set revealed that higher DEC1 expression in H. pylori‐positive
  GC was significantly correlated with the epithelial cell signalling in Helicobacter
  pylori infecting, apoptosis and pathway in cancer. B. Effect of H. Pylori infection
  on the expression of p‐Akt and NF‐κB p65. (MOI = 10, 8h) C. DEC1 regulates p‐Akt
  and NF‐kb p65 expression in GC cells. All the experiments were repeated three times.
  EV, empty vector; OV, overexpression vector. *p < 0.05
article_title: DEC1 promotes progression of Helicobacter pylori‐positive gastric cancer
  by regulating Akt/NF‐κB pathway.
