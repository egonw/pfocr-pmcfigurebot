caption: Activation of inflammation-associated signal pathways during B. hermsii infection.
  Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected i.p. with 5 Ã— 104 spirochetes of B. hermsii
  and at days 0 and 14 post inoculation, spinal cords were harvested for RNA-seq analysis
  (n = 4 for each time point). (A) Volcano plot representing differential gene expression
  on 0- and 14-d post infection. A subset of differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq
  (B) was validated by qRT-PCR (C). (D) Enrichment of regulatory pathways involved
  in B. hermsii infection was analyzed via KEGG. (E) Involvement of IL-17 signaling
  pathway during B. hermsii infection was revealed by GSEA.
