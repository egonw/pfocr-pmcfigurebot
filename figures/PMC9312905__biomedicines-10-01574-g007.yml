caption: Proposed mechanism of action of Klotho in the modulation of ion channels
  and intracellular calcium handling in human atrial fibroblasts. Klotho inhibits
  the activation of the PLC-IP3signaling and suppresses thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+
  release, and subsequently attenuates SOCE by inhibition of TRPC6 currents. In addition,
  Klotho may also inhibit the PLC-DAG pathway and negatively modulate the inward currents
  of TRPC6. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  STIM1, stromal interaction molecule 1; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium
  transport ATPase; TG, thapsigargin.
