caption: 'Microglial expression of gal-3 in ON associated with MOG-induced EAE. Naïve
  (A–D) and EAE mice were perfused at either the peak (E–I) or chronic (J–M) disease
  stage after MOG immunization. Frozen sections of the optic nerve to optic tract
  were stained with anti-Iba-1 antibody (a marker of microglia; (A,E,J), green) and
  anti-gal-3 antibody ((B,F,K), red). DAPI staining (blue) was also performed. Merged
  images are also shown (C,D,G–I,L,M). High-magnification images of the regions in
  the insets (C,G,L) are also shown (D,H,M). High-magnification image of the inset
  in (H) is shown in (I). Galectin-3 is co-expressed in Iba-1+ cells (white arrows).
  (N–S) Quantitative analysis. The numbers of DAPI+ cells (N), Iba-1+ cells (O), gal-3+
  cells (P), gal-3+Iba-1+ cells (Q), and gal-3+Iba-1+ cells/gal-3+ cells (R) in the
  optic nerve of naïve and EAE mice. Six mice per group were examined. (S) Immunoblot
  analysis showing expression of gal-3 in the optic nerve from naïve and EAE mice.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. Representative data are shown. Ratio of Galectin-3/GAPDH
  (N = 5). Scale bars: (C,G,L): 100 μm; (D,H,M): 50 μm; (I): 25 μm. ** p < 0.01.'
