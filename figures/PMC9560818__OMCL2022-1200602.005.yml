caption: 'YAP is the downstream of PCAF in PA-stimulated senescence in HUVECs. (a)–(c)
  PCAF and YAP were knocked down in HUVECs using siRNA in the treatment of PA or not.
  The expression of p53, p16, pH2A.X, and p21 protein were by immunoblotting (a),
  relative IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression were analyzed by RT-PCR (b) and immunoblotting
  (c). (d) Quantitative analysis of SaβG staining. Scale bars, 20 μm. E-G: PCAF and
  YAP were overexpressed in HUVECs using plasmids in the treatment of PA or not. The
  expression of p53, p16, pH2A.X, and p21 protein were by immunoblotting (e), relative
  IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression were analyzed by RT-PCR (f) and immunoblotting (g).
  (h) Quantitative analysis of SaβG staining. Scale bars, 20 μm. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 3 for each experiment. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n.s.
  P > 0.05).'
