figure_title: The underlying mechanism of KIF15 on prostate cancer was explored through
  antibody array and western blot analysis
caption: A A Human Apoptosis Antibody Array was used to identify differentially expressed
  apoptosis-related proteins between shKIF15 and shCtrl groups of DU 145 cells. B
  The differentially expressed proteins identified by human apoptosis antibody array.
  C The protein levels of CD40L, cytoC, DR6, p21, and Survivin were detected by western
  blot analysis in DU 145 and PC-3 cells with or without KIF15 knockdown. Data were
  shown as mean with SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

  and induces apoptosis through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
