caption: PDGF production and PDGF receptors specificity in and by pulmonary cells.
  PDGF are produced as four isoforms (A, to D) which are present as 4 homodimers and
  1 heterodimer (PDGF-AB). Fibroblasts express the 4 isoforms of PDGF, endothelial
  cells and neurons express PDGF-A to C and platelet, macrophages and lymphocytes
  express PDGF-A and B. The PDGF receptor type α (PDGFRα) binds PDGF-A, -B and -C
  when PDGFRβ binds PDGF-B and -D. Both receptors dimerize upon PDGF binding leading
  to homo or heterodimers with different binding specificities. PDGF signaling involves
  multiple pathways and lead to cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and
  survival.
