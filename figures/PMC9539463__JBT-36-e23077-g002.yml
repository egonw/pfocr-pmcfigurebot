caption: DDX3X regulated Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity via canonical Wnt/β‐catenin signaling
  pathway. “+” symbol denotes presence and “–” symbol denotes absence of the corresponding
  treatment condition. (A) The protein level of β‐catenin in H9c2 cells treated with
  Dox (2 μM) for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. Data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05
  refers to not significant; *p < 0.05. (B) The protein level of β‐catenin in H9c2
  cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection. Data are presented
  as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (C)
  The protein level of β‐catenin in H9c2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following RK‐33
  pretreatment. Data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant;
  *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001. (D) The protein level of β‐catenin in H9c2 cells treated
  with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x plasmids transfection. Data are presented as means ± SEM.
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (E) The protein level of DDX3X, β‐catenin, Casp‐3, and cleaved
  Casp‐3 in H9c2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection
  and Licl pretreatment. Data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to
  not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (F) Mito‐Tracker Red CMXRos and Hoechst
  33342 staining were detected respectively mitochondrial morphology and nuclear condensation
  of H9c2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x siRNA transfection and Licl
  pretreatment. Scale bar = 0 μm
