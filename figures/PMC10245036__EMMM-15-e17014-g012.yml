figure_title: Effects of long‐term exposure to PM2.5 on the AhR‐TMPRSS2 axis in lung
  cancer cells
caption: 'A, BH1975 cells were treated with 50 μg/ml PM2.5 for 90 days, and the expression
  levels of TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein were determined by real‐time RT–PCR (A) and Western
  blotting (B), respectively.CThe proteins from whole cell lysates (WCL) and nuclear
  fractions (CN) were analyzed for AhR, lamin B (nuclei marker), and vimentin (cytoplasm
  marker) by Western blotting.DChIP–qPCR analysis of AhR binding to the promoter of
  the TMPRSS2 locus. The chromatin of untreated or treated H1975 cells was immunoprecipitated
  using AhR antibody. Precipitated genomic DNA was amplified for the five sites (RG1a,
  1d, 1f, 1 h, and 2a) in the proximal promoter of the TMPRSS2 locus by real‐time
  PCR. Data were normalized to the input and expressed as “Fold change” relative to
  the IgG control of H1975 cells.EWestern blot analysis of TMPRSS2 expression in cells
  treated with CH223191 at 10 μM for 48 h. The relative expression level of TMPRSS2
  was quantified by normalizing with β‐actin and is shown in the right panel. Data
  information: The data shown represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, compared with untreated cells. #P < 0.05,
  compared with PM2.5‐treated cells. The results shown in (B, C, and E) are from one
  of three similar experiments. (A) P‐values were determined by one‐sample t‐test.
  (D) One‐way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple‐comparisons test of post hoc analysis were
  used when homogeneity of variance across groups (RG1a, RG1d, and RG1f) occurred;
  Welch''s ANOVA and Games–Howell test of post hoc analysis were used when variance
  across groups was not equal (RG1h and RG2a). (E) P‐values were determined by one‐sample
  t‐test. Source data are available online for this figure.'
