caption: Enteric P.e. infection downregulates the expression of many transcription
  factor genes. a, b) GO analysis (a, biological process categories, b, molecular
  function categories) of genes showing >1.5-fold increase following enteric infections.
  c) Heatmap depicting the change in expression (Log2-fold change vs mock-infected
  flies) of transcription factor genes following enteric infection. Grey symbols show
  genes with strong enrichment in either the head/brain or intestinal system, based
  on expression levels from FlyAtlas2. d) qPCR analysis of selected transcription
  factor mRNA levels from control (w1118) vs imd mutant adult females, that were either
  mock-infected (grey bars and symbols) or infected by oral feeding with P.e. for
  24 h (blue bars and symbols). Bars represent mean±SEM. Symbols represent individual
  data points, n = 4–6 per condition. * P < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA, followed by Student’s
  t-test.
