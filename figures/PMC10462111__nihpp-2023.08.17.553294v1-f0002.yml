caption: 'A) Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (in black). GlcNAc and GlcN are imported
  or recycled from peptidoglycan. The fate of metabolites is decided by the relative
  activities of NagB and GlmS. Shown in red is the alternative pathway provided by
  the GlcNAc 1-kinase NahK, allowing GlcNAc to be directly phosphorylated to GlcNAc-1P.B)
  Confocal laser scanning microscopy. E. coli BW25113 pBAD(nahK) cells were grown
  (4 hrs at 37 °C) with GlcNAz (1 mM) or AzAcOH (5 mM). Cells were incubated with
  DBCO-Cy5 (10 μM; 1 hr at 37 °C) and counterstained with DAPI before widefield (TL
  BF). Experiment was performed twice with similar results. Scale bar is 1 μM.C) GlcNAz
  incorporation into whole cells. E. coli BW25113 pBAD(nahK) were grown (4 hrs at
  37 °C) with azide species: GlcNAz (GN; 1 mM) or AzAcOH (AA; 5 mM). Cells were incubated
  with DBCO-Cy5 (10 μM; 1 hr at 37 °C) and measured in bulk for retained Cy5 fluorescence
  after washing; values are normalized to the number of cells per sample. Error bars
  represent ±SD of 3 biological replicates; significance was determined using unpaired
  t-tests. **P ≤ 0.002.'
