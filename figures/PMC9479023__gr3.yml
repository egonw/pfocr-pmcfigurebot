caption: 'HG conditions inhibited the Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway in podocytes. (A)
  Western blot analysis of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in podocytes after treatment with
  HG or mannitol for 24 h. (B–C) Quantification of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. ∗P <
  0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05 vs. HG group. (D) Western blot analysis of Nrf2 and
  HO-1 expression in podocytes after treatment with HG for different time points.
  (E–F) Quantification of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. ∗P < 0.05 vs. NG group, #P < 0.05
  vs. mannitol group, △P < 0.05 vs. 6 h group, and &P < 0.05 vs. 12 h group. The uncropped
  images of (A and D) were referred to in supplementary Figure 2.'
