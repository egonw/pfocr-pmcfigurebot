caption: Relative quantification of mRNA of wildtype and no.7 in SD and in SD/YNBG
  under anaerobic conditions. Shown data are the relative mRNA levels normalized by
  level of RDN18 as a housekeeping gene and by level of each gene of wildtype and
  no.7 under different media (SD and YNBG) at 24 h. The relative mRNA levels of wildtype
  in SD, no.7 in SD, and no.7 in YNBG are shown as blue, orange, and gray bars, respectively.
  Error bars indicate the SD of six replicate experiments (n = 6). The metabolic map
  is divided into three parts mainly including the (a) glucoseâ€“glycerol pathway, (b)
  pyruvate-ethanol pathway, and (c) TCA cycle. The same-colored star marks in the
  same figures mean transcription levels of the same enzymes; same-colored circle
  marks in (a,b) mean transcription levels of the same enzymes, especially ALDs and
  ADHs.
