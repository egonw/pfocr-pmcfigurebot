  of TRIB3. (A) Schematic representation of phosphoproteomics experiment using SILAC.
  (B) Pathway analysis using Metascape [] of phospho-peptides found differentially
  phosphorylated in Sh-TRIB3 compared to Sh-control in MCF7 cells. (C) Schematic representation
  of phosphorylation of T916 in SET1A. (D) Post-translational modifications in SET1A
  according to Phosphositeplus® [].
