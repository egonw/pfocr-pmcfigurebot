caption: A. muciniphila abundance decreases in human CRC tissues and up-regulating
  A. muciniphila inhibits CRC in vivo. (A) Polyp, A-CRA, and CRC tissues with decreased
  abundances of A. muciniphila. Scale bar, 100 mm. (B) Expression levels of A. muciniphila
  in Polyp, A-CRA, and CRC tissues and their fecal bacteria were analyzed by qRT-PCR.
  Sample numbers for the three groups were described as Materials and methods. **P
  < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test (C) Expression of A. muciniphila. in matched Polyp,
  A-CRA, and CRC tissues and their corresponding fecal bacteria. The bold horizontal
  bar represents mean expression levels (D) Experimental design of the intragastric
  administration and grouping. Mice (aged 4 weeks) were treated with Abx from W1 to
  W4, then injected with AOM (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) at the first day of W5, and provided
  drinking water for 1 week, and three cycles with DSS and drinking water for 3 weeks
  as described in the Methods section. During the treatment, A. muciniphila and Vehicle
  (E. coli MG1655 or the same volume of phosphate buffer saline) were orally administrated
  (108 CFU/mice). (E, F) Effects of A. muciniphila on colon length (E) and number
  of tumors (F) in pseudo-GF/AOM/DSS mice. Data of eight mice per experimental group
  are expressed as means ± SD, with Welch's correction through one-tailed t-test.
  **P < 0.01 (G) Typical adenomatous intestinal polyps with the early invasion of
  neoplastic glands into the muscular layers were observed in A. muciniphila infected
  pseudo-GF/AOM/DSS mice. This typical regressive change is observed throughout the
  intestine in the mice. Green arrows indicate adenocarcinoma cells. Scale bars, 100
  μM. (H) Histology evaluation of tissues of polyps, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma.
  (I) A stacked bar plot of gena of 16S rRNA sequencing for fecal samples collected
  from model animals (Vehicle; n=6), A. muciniphila infected mice (A. muciniphila;
  n=6).
