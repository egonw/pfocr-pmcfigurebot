caption: The relative expression levels of JH, 20E, and GSC marker genes in female
  C. bowringi. After dsMEK (A), dsKSR2 (B), dsERK (C) and dsP38 (D) injection, the
  expression levels of JHAMT1 and Kr-h1 were determined in the heads, and the transcript
  levels of Shade, E74, Nanos, and Vasa were detected in the ovaries. All data were
  collected at 4 day-PE and were presented as mean Â± SD, ns, no significant difference,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (independent t-tests).
