figure_title: ΔΔ cells motility defect is rescued by an NTRK3-c-Src signaling pathway
caption: 'A Cell motility rescue assay by c-SRC. WT and ΔΔ cells were transfected
  with H2B-mCherry to label and track the nuclei. WT cells were co-transfected with
  GFP expression plasmid (vehicle) and ΔΔ cells were co-transfected with either GFP
  (vehicle), c-Src DN, c-Src WT, or c-Src CA expression plasmid. Each graph corresponds
  to 30 representative tracks of transfected WT or ΔΔ cells with the initial position
  of the cells centered at the origin. B Schematic representation (created with BioRender)
  of c-Src inhibition and activation mechanisms. c-Src inhibition involves both Y527
  phosphorylation by the CSK kinase and Y416dephosphorylation by the PTPN13 phosphatase.
  Upon extracellular signaling by integrins, c-Src disengages from CSK, with concomitant
  Y527dephosphorylation that may involve several putative phosphatases, and finally
  c-Src autophosphorylates on Y416. Signal transducing adaptor proteins such as DAB1
  (Disabled-1) are known to increase c-Src activation. Finally, membrane receptors
  such as the neurotrophin 3 tyrosine kinase receptor NTRK3 have also been shown to
  trigger c-Src activation. C Gene expression of the actors of c-Src inhibition and
  activation pathways in WT and ΔΔ cells. Gene expression levels were normalized to
  Ppia. Data are the normalized mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Gene
  expression were compared between ΔΔ and WT cells using a Student’s t test. ns: not
  significant, ***p < 0.001. D Cell motility rescue assay by NTRK3. (Left) Schematic
  representation of the Ntrk3 isoforms expressed in αT3-1 cells. Ligand domain is
  depicted with red boxes, the transmembrane domain with a green box and the tyrosine
  kinase domain with yellow boxes. The modified exon in Ntrk3-205 isoform is represented
  by a blue box. (Right) Cell motility assay. ΔΔ cells were co-transfected with H2B-mCherry
  and either with Ntrk3-201, Ntrk3-202, or Ntrk3-205 isoform expression plasmids.
  Each graph corresponds to 30 representative tracks of transfected ΔΔ cells with
  the initial position of the cells centered at the origin. E c-SRC-NTRK3 co-immunoprecipitation
  assay. WT cells were co-transfected with c-Src-eGFP and either with 3XFLAG control
  plasmid (lane 1, vehicle) or 3XFLAG-tagged isoform expression plasmids (Lane 2,
  Ntrk3-201, lane 3 Ntrk3-202 and lane 4 Ntrk3-205). NTRK3 was immunoprecipitated
  using anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coated magnetic beads. Immuno-precipitates were analyzed
  by Western blot for NTRK3 precipitation (using anti-FLAG antibody) and for both
  total and pY416 c-Src co-precipitations (Top panels). Expression of FLAG-tagged
  NTRK3, total c-SRC and pY416c-SRC-eGFP were verified by western blot analysis on
  whole cell lysates (Bottom panels). GAPDH was used as an internal reference for
  sample loading. The different bands observed for NTRK3 isoforms are consistent with
  glycosylated forms of the receptor. F Cell velocity analysis. ΔΔ cells were co-transfected
  with H2B-mCherry and either with GFP (vehicle), Ntrk3-201, or a mix of Ntrk3-201
  and DN c-Src expression plasmids. Cell instantaneous speed (µm/minute) was calculated
  from the analysis of over 100 transfected ΔΔ cells over 16 h videomicroscopy, using
  ImageJ TrackMate. ΔΔ cell mean velocity was compared between the three conditions
  by ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test. ns: not significant, ***p < 0.001.'
