caption: Scheme of the proposed pathway of HMOs in pregnancy. HMOs are produced in
  the mammary gland (1) during pregnancy, reach the maternal circulation (2) and might
  cross the placental barrier to reach the cord blood (3) and the amniotic fluid (4),
  before they are excreted via maternal urine (5). HMOs enter fetal circulation via
  the umbilical vein, and might either cycle back to the placenta via the umbilical
  artery or be excreted via fetal urine to reach amniotic fluid (AF) (4a–4c). AF HMOs
  are swallowed and come in extensive contact with gastrointestinal tract mucosal
  lining, where they are partly absorbed into fetal blood (4a) and are excreted via
  urine (4b). HMOs in AF might potentially be absorbed by fetal skin and might also
  come into contact with lungs via fetal aspiration of AF. Created with BioRender.com.
