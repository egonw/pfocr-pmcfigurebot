caption: 'TNFR2 is ubiquitously highly expressed and the TNF‐α/TNFR2 signaling pathway
  is activated in tumor‐infiltrating Tregs as determined by scRNA‐seq analysis. (A)
  Flowchart of scRNA‐seq. scRNA‐seq (BD Rhapsody) was performed on CD4+CD25+CD127−
  Tregs derived from the peripheral blood and tumors of GC patients. The flowchart
  was created with BioRender.com. (B) UMAP plots showing the expression levels of
  TNFR2 in tumor‐infiltrating Tregs (left) and blood Tregs (right). UMAP plots colored
  red indicate high expression of TNFR2, and UMAP plots colored gray indicate low
  expression of TNFR2. All UMAP plot graphics were generated with Seurat. (C) Boxplot
  showing the expression levels of immune‐related genes in tumor‐infiltrating Tregs
  and blood Tregs (Wilcoxon test, P < .05). The boxplot was generated with Python.
  (D) The expression levels of the immune‐related genes in the tumor‐infiltrating
  Tregs and blood Tregs of GC patients were compared by flow cytometry. Independent
  experiments included eight biological duplicates. Statistical analyses were performed
  using GraphPad Prism 8.0.1. The statistical tests used are indicated in the figure
  legends: *P < .05, **P < .01. (E) Pathways enriched with upregulated genes in tumor‐infiltrating
  Tregs. (F) Violin plots showing high expression of TNFR2 and low expression of TNFR1
  in tumor‐infiltrating Tregs. The violin plots were generated with R package [Color
