caption: Current density (IA) profiles of the MECs at (A) a fixed anode potential
  (EAN) of +0.15 V versus SHE and (B) an EAN of âˆ’0.15 V versus SHE, both without NH4+
  added. Vertical arrows show refeedings. The stars show when RNA was extracted. A
  single representative curve from triplicates is shown. All replicate curves are
  available in the supplemental material.
