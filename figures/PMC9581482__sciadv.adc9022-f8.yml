figure_title: Proposed model of LXR inhibition by oxysterol misbalance contributes
  to inflammation and fibrosis in murine WD
caption: Under normal conditions, functional ATP7B maintains Cu homeostasis. Inactivating
  mutations of ATP7B cause Cu accumulation. Cu-induced oxidative stress causes sterol
  misbalance by down-regulating OHC (via Cyps) enzymes and up-regulating sulfotransferases
  (Sult1e1, Sult1a1, and Sult1b1), which inhibit LXR in murine WD. Activation of LXR/RXR
  using T0901317 reverses liver inflammation and fibrosis and partially improves liver
  function in advanced WD. In addition, lipid functions are improved despite Cu overload.
  Significant decreases in inflammation and fibrosis are primarily mediated by changes
  in the abundance of the protein components of the noncanonical TGFÎ² signaling pathway.
  Red arrows indicate the disease state, and green arrows indicate the effect of the
  LXR agonist.
