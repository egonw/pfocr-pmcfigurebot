caption: 'Effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on apoptosis of IL-1β-induced NP cells. (A) The
  apoptosis of IL-1β-induced NP cells detected by flow cytometry. (B) The expression
  of apoptosis-related protein Bax and Bcl-1 detected by Western blot. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD of at least three repeated experiments. *p < 0.05, vs control group;
  #p < 0.05, vs IL-1β group.'
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 relieves rat intervertebral disc degeneration and inhibits
  IL-1β-induced nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
