figure_title: Examples of localization and signaling of GPCRs from intracellular membranes
caption: In addition to the plasma membrane GPCRs localize and signal through G proteins
  in compartments along the biosynthetic pathway (solid arrows) and the endolysosomal
  pathway (dashed arrows). Non-canonical GPCR signaling through G proteins in these
  membranes can proceed by distinct interactions, such as a PTHR-G protein-arrestin
  signaling complex, and produce distinct downstream signaling effects, including
  but not limited to sustained signaling, transcriptional responses, and effects on
  cell growth, neurotransmission, and the perception of pain.
