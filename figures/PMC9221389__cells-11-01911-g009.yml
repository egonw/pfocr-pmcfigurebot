caption: Possible mechanism diagram of S100a8/a9 regulating autophagy and apoptosis
  in the early stage of MI. (A) Neutrophils transfer to the injured area of MI and
  release S100a8/a9. Part of S100a8/a9 returns to neutrophils to regulate gene expression
  (B), and the other part enters cardiomyocytes to regulate cell death (C).

  through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway in the Early Stage of Myocardial
  Infarction.
