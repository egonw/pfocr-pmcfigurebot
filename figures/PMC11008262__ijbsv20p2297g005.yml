caption: TIE1 promotes cervical cancer progression via the Basigin/MMPs pathway. (A)
  The knockdown efficiency of Basigin was verified by Western blotting assay in HeLa
  and SiHa cells, and si-Basigin#2 was selected for further study. (B) Western blotting
  showing the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 under the indicated treatments. (C-D) Transwell
  assays were used to investigate the cell migratory and invasive capacities of HeLa-Vector,
  HeLa-TIE1, HeLa-TIE1 with si-Basigin or AC-73 (Basigin inhibitor). (E) Wound healing
  assays were performed to detect cell migratory abilities in different treatment
  groups. (F-H) Representative pictures of subcutaneous tumors, tumor growth curves
  and tumor weights in the HeLa-Vector group, HeLa-TIE1 group and HeLa-TIE1-AC73 group
  (n = 4 per group). (I) Representative IHC images and histogram analysis showing
  the expression of TIE1, Basigin, Ki-67, MMP2, and MMP9 on the same tissue sections
  in the indicated group. Scale bars = 20 Î¼m. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001.
