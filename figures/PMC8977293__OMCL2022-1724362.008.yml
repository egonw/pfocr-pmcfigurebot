caption: Proposed mechanism by which TT protects the neurons after SCI. After SCI,
  “Naive” astrocytes are activated, and “Reactive” astrocytes secrete inflammatory
  mediators to directly damage neurons. In addition, CSPGs will bind to NGR1, 3, activate
  downstream RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway to inhibit neurite outgrowth, which indirectly
  damage neurons. TT can effectively inhibit the activation of astrocytes to promote
  axonal outgrowth after SCI.
