caption: XPO1 is overexpressed in resistant and relapsed DLBCL. A, XPO1 copy number
  (x-axis) and transcript expression (y-axis) in a cohort of 750 treatment-naïve primary
  DLBCLs. B and C, Frequency of treatment-naïve primary DLBCL cases with low, medium,
  and high XPO1 protein expression (determined by IHC) in relation to XPO1 copy number
  (diploid vs. gains, n = 42 pts, WES and WGS; B) and response to R-CHOP (n = 57 pts;
  C). Statistical analysis was performed by Chi-square test. D, Frequency of XPO1
  copy number in 750 treatment-naïve primary DLBCL cases classified as GCB-DLBCL versus
  ABC-DLBCL by RNA-seq profiling. E and F, IFNγ response (E) and cell proliferation
  and DNA repair (F) pathway analysis (GSEA) in 4,655 primary DLBCLs stratified by
  XPO1 increasing gene expression quartiles (Q) by RNA-seq.
