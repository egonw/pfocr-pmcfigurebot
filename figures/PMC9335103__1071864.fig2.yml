caption: Composite copy number alteration profiles of three disease groups. (A) Composite
  map showing the focal copy number alteration spectrum in three disease groups. The
  red and blue represent copy number gain and loss, respectively. Each row represents
  a genomic locus while each column represents a case. Bars on the right represent
  the proportion of each disease type in copy number aberrations identified. PTCL-EBV
  patients had fewer focal copy number aberrations compared to patients with ENKTL
  and PTCL-NOS. (B) Penetrance plots showing the frequency of gains and losses of
  genomic loci in ENKTL, PTCL-EBV and PTCL-NOS groups. The X-axis represents chromosome
  number and the Y-axis indicates the proportion of gain or loss of the corresponding
  genomic loci within the corresponding population. Red bars denote copy number gains
  and blue bars denote copy number losses. PTCL-EBV exhibited less frequent genomic
  alterations compared to other disease groups. (C) Boxplot depicting total copy number
  segment counts (left), gains only (middle) and losses only (right) across the three
  diseases. Differences among the three groups were determined using the Kruskal-Wallis
  test while pairwise comparisons were assessed by the MannWhitney U test (P values
  shown). PTCL-EBV displayed lower segment counts compared to ENKTL and PTCL-NOS.
  (D, E) Copy number segment size distribution of gains (D) and losses (E) in the
  three disease groups. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sample
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with P values indicated in the table. PTCL-EBV gain and
  loss distributions were enriched for smaller copy number segments compared to the
  other disease groups.
