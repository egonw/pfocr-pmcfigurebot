caption: 'Association between STAT1, JAK1, and ISG’s expressions using the GSE152075
  dataset. (A) Schematic representation of the canonical IFN-γ signaling pathway.
  (B) Gene expression analysis (log2 (norm counts +1)) for MX1 (i), MX2 (ii), ISG15
  (iii), and OAS1 (iv) in COVID-19 (purple) vs. non-COVID-19 (pink) patients from
  the GSE152075 dataset, assessed by RNA-seq. p-values correspond to Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test. (C) Dot plots representing the pairwise Spearman correlation between STAT1
  and JAK1, considering the expressions of MX1 (ii), MX2 (ii), ISG15 (iii), and OAS1
  (iv) in COVID-19-positive patients. The independent variable is plotted on the x
  axis, and the dependent variable is plotted on the y axis. MX1, MX2, ISG15 and OAS1
  expressions are represented as a color scale (purple = high; pink = low). (D) Box
  plot representing the combined expression of MX1 + MX2 + ISG15 + OAS1 and their
  association with the viral load. Viral load was categorized as Negative (pink),
  Low (first quartile; light blue), Intermediate (second and third quartile; purple),
  or High (fourth quartile; blue). p-values correspond to Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
  (E) Dot plot representing pairwise Spearman correlation between JAK2 + STAT1 and
  MX1 + MX2 + ISG15 + OAS1 combined expressions, considering viral load in COVID-19-positive
  patients from the GSE152075 dataset. Viral load is represented as a color scale
  and was categorized as Negative (pink), Low (first quartile; light blue), Intermediate
  (second and third quartile; purple), or High (fourth quartile; blue). (F) Forest
  plots representing the coefficient of the viral load as predictor variable in regression
  analyses (considering age and gender as covariables). (i) Model considering as response
  variable: combined expression of JAK2 + STAT1 or MX1 + MX2 + ISG15 + OAS1; and (ii)
  model considering response variable: individual expressions of JAK2, STAT1, MX1,
  MX2, ISG15 and OAS1. Coef.: Coefficient. CI: Confidence interval. Statistical significance
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
