caption: Strategies to modulate the ISR in ALS experimental models. Pharmacologically,
  (i) ISR inhibition or exacerbation can be achieved by directly tuning either of
  the four ISR kinases. Most of the studies are focused on the pharmacological inhibition
  of PERK with the kinase inhibitor GSK2606414 []. In the last years, other small
  molecules have been developed to activate/inhibit other ISR kinases, such as GZD824
  or Neratinib, that block GCN2. (ii) The levels of eIF2a phosphorylation can also
  be tuned by inhibiting phospho-eIF2a dephosphorylation. To that aim, ALS studies
  have focused on the pharmacological inhibition of GADD34, the stress-induced Protein
  Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit, required for dephosphorylation of eIF2a. Salubrinal
  [], guanabenz [], or (more recently) sephin1 [] promote the increased phosphorylation
  of p-eIF2a by targeting the GADD34-PP1 holoenzyme. Finally, (iii) the ISR can be
  inhibited by using downstream inhibitors of the pathway, such as ISRIB [] or its
  derivatives (DNL343 [], and ABBV-CLS-7262 []). ISRIB, or its derivatives, promotes
  the dimerization of eIF2B pentamers and allows the recycling of eIF2-GDP into eIF2-GTP
  even when eIF2a is phosphorylated. Restoration of eIF2B recycling overrules (at
  least in part) ISR translational regulation. Two FDA-approved drugs, Trazodone and
  DBM, display ISRIB-like effects under ISR-inducing conditions. Based on their capacity
  to tune ISR, the repurposing of these compounds has been tested in neurodegenerative
  models other than ALSs []. Beyond these ISR-specific drugs, compounds such as metformin
  that have a broad effect in metabolism can also affect ISR, [] and PBA or TUDCA
  and a TUDCA-derivative (defined as chemical chaperones that mitigate stress) have
  been also tested in ALS and in patients [,,,]. In proof of principle studies, the
  ISR has been modulated using genetic tools/approaches (labeled with dashed blue
  rectangles to indicate); for instance, the genetic elimination of PERK or the generation
  of a truncated, inactive version of GADD34 have been used to reduce or enhance the
  ISR [,]. Also, the elimination of ATF4 and CHOP have been attempted [,] together
  with the overexpression of the ATF4-target gene ATF3 [] and the removal of the UPR
  transcription factor XBP1 []. Finally, the intervention with AAV vectors is a very
  exciting opportunity to reach the correct cell type, as we can discuss below [].
