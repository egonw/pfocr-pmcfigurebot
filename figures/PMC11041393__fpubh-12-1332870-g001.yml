caption: Simplified directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicting the relationship between
  social determinants of health (SDoH) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic
  liver disease (MASLD). The DAG includes the direct effect of SDoH on MASLD (red
  pathway), as well as the indirect effect through mediators (yellow pathway). The
  blue pathway represents the way in which the covariates modify the effect of SDoH
  on MASLD (effect modifiers). Clinical conditions related to MASLD, and health-related
  behaviors are green representing their roles as both mediators (yellow) and effect
  modifiers (blue). *Made with graphics from Biorender.com.

  for MASLD: a scoping review.'
