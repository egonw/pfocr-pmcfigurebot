caption: 'Intercellular transfer of miR-224-5p agomir by exosomes promoted malignant
  transformation of CCD 841 CoN cells via CMTM4/Akt/ERK pathway. SW620 cells were
  transfected with NC, miR-224-5p agomir, or miR-224-5p antagomir for 48 h. CCD 841
  CoN cells were cocultured with exosomes isolated from the transfected SW620 cells
  in the presence or absence of CMTM4-OE. (a–d) CMTM4, p-Akt, and p-ERK expressions
  in CCD 841 CoN cells were detected with western blotting assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the
  Exo-NC group; ##P < 0.01 vs. the Exo-miR-224-5p agomir group.'
