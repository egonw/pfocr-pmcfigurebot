figure_title: Renal function and serum‐related indexes changed in Sprague‐Dawley rats
  after 5/6 nephrectomy
caption: Blood samples were collected 16 weeks after surgery. A, Blood urea nitrogen
  (BUN) levels (n=6 rats/group, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). B, Serum creatinine (SCR) levels
  (n=6 rats/group, *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). C and D, Serum transforming growth factor
  (TGF)‐β1 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 levels (n=6 rats/group, not significant
  [ns]). E, FGF23 levels in the chronic kidney disease (CKD)+vehicle group and CKD+GANT‐61
  group were higher than those in the sham operation group (n=6 rats/group, *P<0.05
  and **P<0.01). F, Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (n=6 rats/group, *P<0.05 and
  **P<0.01).
