caption: 'Oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway is significantly increased in
  miltefosine-resistant L. infantum parasites. (A) Sum of the abundance of proteins
  involved in the main pathways of energy production. (B) The dot plot shows the sum
  of the concentrations of the proteins involved in each oxidative phosphorylation
  complex. WT: wild-type strain, n = 3; LiR: resistant strain, n = 4. Significant
  differences observed between WT and LiR parasites were determined by two-way ANOVA
  followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p <
  0.0001). OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; TCA: tricarboxylic acid. Complex I:
  NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase; complex II: succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase;
  complex III: ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase; complex IV: cytochrome c oxidase;
  complex V: FoF1-ATP synthase. Each dot represents the total sum of the concentration
  values of proteins involved in those processes or complexes in each biological replicate.'
