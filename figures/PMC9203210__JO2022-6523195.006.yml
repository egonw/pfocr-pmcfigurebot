  Determination and quantification of pathway-related protein expression levels in
  PC-3 sh-NC and sh-CHRM1 cells by western blotting. ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (c-d) Determination
  and quantification of changes of pathway-related protein in PC‐3 sh-NC and sh-Atg5
  cells by western blotting. ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (e) Graphical schematic of
  the autophagy induced by CHRM1, which mediates migration and invasion targeting
  Atg5 via AMPK/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer.
