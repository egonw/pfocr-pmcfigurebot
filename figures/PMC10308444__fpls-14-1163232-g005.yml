caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis showed that BCMV infection significantly inhibited
  the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and the photosynthetic apparatus
  in poplar mosaic disease. (A, B), KEGG enrichment results in the Photosynthesis
  pathway (ko00195); (C, D); KEGG enrichment results in the Photosynthetic apparatus
  pathway (ko00190). SD: short-period diseased poplar leaves; SD: long-period diseased
  poplar leaves. Genes in green represent downward adjustment when compared to the
  control, genes in blue represent both upward and downward adjustment, while no gene
  was upregulated in SD and LD leaves.'
article_title: Integrated transcriptome and microRNA sequencing analyses reveal gene
  responses in poplar leaves infected by the novel pathogen bean common mosaic virus
  (BCMV).
