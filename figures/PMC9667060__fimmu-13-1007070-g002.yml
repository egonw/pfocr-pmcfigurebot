caption: Kinetics of Leishmania infection in WT versus cGAS-, STING- or TBK1-knockout
  THP-1 cells. Low dose [(A) and (B) or high dose (C) and (D)] PMA differentiated
  THP-1 cells were infected with eGFP expressing L. major parasites at a MOI of 1:10
  (macrophage:parasite). At indicated time points (6,24,48 and 72 h), infection percentages
  and parasite loads were quantified using a flow cytometer. Data presented in graphs
  represent the average of two independent experiments with technical replicates ±
  SD. Statistical comparisons to WT cells were based on two-way ANOVA followed by
  Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ns, not significant, *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.001,
  ****p≤0.0001.
