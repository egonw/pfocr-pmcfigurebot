caption: MEOX2 depletion induces the apoptosis of glioblastoma stem cells BT273 and
  BT379. (a). Cleaved Caspase-3 Western blot analysis of BT273 and BT379 cells transduced
  with shRNA18 or shRNA53 or ctrl lentiviral constructs. Total Caspase-3 is shown.
  β-actin was used as the internal loading control. (n = 3; mean ± SD). One representative
  image is shown. The histograms on the right show the quantification of Cleaved Caspase-3
  in relation to β-actin. (Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired
  Student’s t-test (two-tailed). Significance was defined as * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01,
  statistical difference compared to the control). (b). One representative dot plot
  of the percentage of Annexin V/7AAD positive and negative cells analysed by Flow
  cytometry analysis; the mean values ± s.d. of three independent experiments performed
  were reported in . (c). FACS analysis based on Propidium Iodide staining of hypodiploid
  nuclei fraction (%) in either BT273 or BT379 GSCs transduced with shRNA18 or shRNA53.
  Data are presented as mean values ± s.d. Differences between two groups were assessed
  using unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed). Significance was defined as ** p ≤
  0.01.
