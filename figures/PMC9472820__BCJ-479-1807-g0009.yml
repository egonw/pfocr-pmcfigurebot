figure_title: Carbidopa-mediated IDO1 suppression is also mediated by AhR indirectly
  by interfering with the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway
caption: (A and B) Western blotting showing protein expression of JAK1, STAT1 (both
  phospho-form and total) in BxPC-3 and HPAF-II cells lines treated with various concentrations
  of carbidopa (100 µM, 500 µM and 1000 µM) for 24 h. β-actin was used as an endogenous
  control. (C) Immunoprecipitation data showing carbidopa-mediated promotion of AhR
  and STAT1 interaction in HPAF-II cells. (D) Immunoprecipitation data showing ubiquitinated
  STAT1 and ubiquitinated AhR in HPAF-II cells treated with various concentrations
  of carbidopa. (E) Western blotting showing AhR expression following carbidopa treatment,
  either in the presence or absence of MG132.
