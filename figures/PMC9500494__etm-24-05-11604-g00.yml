caption: IMPA2 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and IMPA2 is efficiently
  knocked down by lentivirus in the ES-2 and SKOV3 cell lines. (A) The mRNA expression
  levels of IMPA2 were analyzed in ovarian cancer from the Gemini database. (B) The
  mRNA expression levels of IMPA2 were detected using RT-qPCR in the SKOV3, ES-2,
  HEY and OVCAR3 cell lines. (C) Protein expression levels were analyzed in the ES-2
  and SKOV3 cell lines transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2 using western blot analysis.
  GAPDH was used as the internal control. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. IMPA2, inositol
  monophosphatase 2; sh, short hairpin; Ctrl, control.
article_title: Inositol monophosphatase 2 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer cell
  proliferation and migration by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
