figure_title: ESCRT-I depletion causes enlargement of lysosomes in RKO cells
caption: '(A) Western blots showing the depletion efficiencies of ESCRT-I subunits,
  Tsg101, or Vps28 (using two single siRNAs for each subunit, #1 or #2), as compared
  to control conditions (nontargeting siRNAs, Ctrl#1 or #2), in RKO cells. The GAPDH
  protein is shown as a gel loading control. (B) Maximum intensity projection confocal
  images of fixed RKO cells showing the effects of ESCRT-I depletion on the intracellular
  distribution of LAMP1 (red) as compared with control conditions. Cell nuclei marked
  with DAPI stain (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. Dot plot on the right showing the mean
  area of LAMP1-positive vesicles in control or ESCRT-I–depleted cells, calculated
  based on confocal microscopy images including those shown on the left. Values derived
  from independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 3 ± SEM) are presented.
  Statistical significance tested by comparison to averaged values measured for siCtrl#1
  and #2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (C) Western blots showing the efficiency of ESCRT-I
  depletion due to the CRISPR/Cas9–mediated knockout of TSG101 in RKO cells transduced
  with two single-guide RNAs (gRNAs, gTsg101#1 and #2) as compared with nontargeting
  gRNAs (gCtrl#1 and #2). Tubulin is shown as a gel-loading control. (D) Maximum intensity
  projection confocal images of live RKO cells showing the effects of TSG101 knockout
  on the intracellular distribution of lysosomes stained with LysoTracker dye (red).
  Cell nuclei marked with Hoechst stain (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. The dot plot on
  the right shows mean area of detected lysosomal structures in control or TSG101
  knockout cells, calculated based on live cell microscopy images (including those
  shown on the left). Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their
  means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison
  to averaged values measured for gCtrl#1 and #2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
