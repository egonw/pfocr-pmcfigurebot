caption: 'ERα-NRF1-OMI regulates proliferation of VSMCs via mitophagy. (A–D), Western
  blot analysis of SM-MHC, α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon, OPN and PCNA protein (A,B)
  and EdU incorporation assay (C,D) in A7r5 cells treated with or without FBS and
  transfected with Adenoviruses expressing ERα. (E–H) Western blot analysis of SM-MHC,
  α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon, OPN and PCNA protein (E,F) and EdU incorporation assay
  (G,H) in A7r5 cells treated with or without FBS and transfected with Adenoviruses
  expressing OMI. 3MA and FCCP were used as mitophagy inhibitor and activator, respectively.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control, ###p < 0.001 vs. FBS, Δp < 0.05,
  ΔΔp < 0.01 and ΔΔΔp < 0.001 vs. FBS + Ad-ERα/Ad-OMI.'
