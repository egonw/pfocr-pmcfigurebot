caption: 'THBS2 mediated OD of VICs. (a) and (b) Relative mRNA (a) and protein (b)
  expressions of THBS2 in VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and THBS2 overexpression plasmid
  were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot after the induction of OD. GAPDH was
  a loading control. (c) ALP activity of VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and THBS2 overexpression
  plasmid was detected through colorimetry after the induction of OD. (d) Calcic nodule
  formation of VICs transfected with shTHBS2 and THBS2 overexpression plasmid was
  observed by Alizarin red staining after the induction of OD (scale: 200 μm; magnification:
  ×100). (e and f) Relative mRNA expressions of osteocalcin, Runx2, SPARC, COL1A2,
  and COL1A1 (e) and SPP1, CTGF, MMP-2, and MMP-13 (f) in VICs transfected with shTHBS2
  and THBS2 overexpression plasmid were determined through qRT-PCR after the induction
  of OD. GAPDH was a loading control. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. vector
  group. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. Data were
  performed as the means ± standard deviation. Abbreviations: THBS2: thrombospondin
  2; OD: osteogenic differentiation; VICs: valve interstitial cells; shTHBS2: short
  hairpin THBS2; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction;
  GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; Runx2:
  Runt-related transcription factor-2; SPARC: secreted protein acidic and rich in
  cysteine; COL1A: collagen type I alpha; SPP1: secreted phosphoprotein 1; CTGF: connective
  tissue growth factor; MMP-: matrix metalloproteinase-.'

  Valve Interstitial Cells via Inhibition of Akt/NF-κB Signaling Pathway to Promote
  Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Development.
