caption: Steroid metabolic pathways in the fetal adrenal zones, A; with the developmental
  timeline of each zone during gestation, B. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein
  (StAR), expressed in the fetal zone (FZ) (and transition zone [TZ]) from 6–8 wpc
  and in the definitive zone (DZ) only from 22–23 wpc; cytochrome P450 cholesterol
  side chain cleavage (CYP11A1), expressed in the FZ from 8–9 wpc and onwards, and
  in the TZ from 14–22 weeks, while the expression in the DZ appears only from 17–19
  and 23 wpc; cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), expressed in
  the FZ (already from 8–9 wpc) and TZ from 14–24 wpc; 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (3βHSD2) is expressed from 8–19 wpc in the DZ and from 24–41 wpc in the TZ; cytochrome
  P450 steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) is sparsely expressed in the DZ between 13–24
  wpc (only becoming prominent during late gestation) and detected in the FZ and TZ
  from 14 wpc (while detection in the FZ at 9–19 wpc has been shown); cytochrome P450
  aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), becomes prominent in the DZ during late gestation;
  and cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) is expressed in the fetal adrenal,
  in both the FZ and TZ by 13–24 wpc (limited weak staining in the FZ between 8–12
  wpc has also been shown) [, , , , , ]. Steroids boxed in orange, steroid substrates
  for the backdoor pathway; steroids boxed in grey, steroid substrates for placental
  aromatase; steroid boxed in blue, steroid substrate for placental HSD11B2; steroids
  boxed in black, steroid end-products of each zone of the fetal adrenal
