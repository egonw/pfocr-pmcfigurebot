caption: Tumor cells with nonhomozygous copy number losses in single ATGs maintain
  proliferation under metabolic stress. (a) Western blot for ATGs. β-Actin is shown
  as loading control. C, control clone transfected with nontargeting nuclease and
  WT, wild-type H460. (b) Clonogenic growth assay. (c,d) Real-time live cell imaging
  of cells under treatment. (c) Proliferation kinetics. Shown is the mean confluence
  in % (n = 3). (d) AUC of proliferation curves shown in (c) relative to untreated.
  Shown is the mean ± SD (n = 3). Differential treatment responses were tested for
  statistical significance by 2-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.
  p-values denote pairwise comparisons of mutant with parental wild-type cells; ***,
  p < 0.0001. UN, untreated.
