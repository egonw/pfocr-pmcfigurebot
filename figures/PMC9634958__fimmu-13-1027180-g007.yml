caption: 'WGCNA of the PBMCs transcriptome. (A, B) Analysis of network topology for
  various soft-thresholding powers. The left panel shows the scale-free fit index
  (y-axis) as a function of the soft-thresholding power (x-axis). The right panel
  displays the mean connectivity (degree, y-axis) as a function of the soft-thresholding
  power (x-axis). (C, D) 3D cluster map of genes, based on differences in topological
  overlap, and assigned module colors. (E) Heatmap depicts the Topological Overlap
  Matrix (TOM) of genes selected for weighted co-expression network analysis. Light
  color represents lower overlap and red represents higher overlap. (F) Module-trait
  associations: Each row corresponds to a module eigengene and each column to a trait.
  Each cell contains the corresponding correlation and p-value. (G) Scatter diagram
  for MM vs GS in the greenyellow (eigengene value = 0.48). (H) KEGG signaling pathway
  enriched by greenyellow gene module.'
