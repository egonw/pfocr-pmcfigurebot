caption: SM induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest without inducing apoptotic cell death
  in keratinocytes. (a) HaCaT cells were treated with indicated concentrations of
  SM for 24 h before analyzing cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Untreated
  cells were used as the negative control. (b) HaCaT cells were treated with TGF-β1
  in the presence or absence of indicated concentrations of SM for 24 h. The cells
  were collected and incubated with AV-FITC and PI for flow cytometry analysis. Numbers
  indicate the percentage of cells within the indicated gate. Results are representative
  of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. AV, annexin V; h, hour;
  Padj, adjusted P-value; PI, propidium iodide; SM, silymarin.
