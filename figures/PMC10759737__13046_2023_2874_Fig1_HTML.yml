caption: Association of high RPTOR expression or the ceramide pathway with NSCLC-BM.
  A, B RNA sequencing showed that RPTOR was more highly expressed in BM than other
  genes like PLP1, GFAP, TF, PMP2 and TUBB4A, which was validated by qRT-PCR. C, D
  IHC analysis showed that the BM + group reported a higher RPTOR expression and score
  than the BM- group (100x, 200 × magnification, scale bar = 100 μm). E Kaplan–Meier
  analysis showed that the median survival was significantly lower in the high RPTOR
  (18 samples with IHC scores ≥ 6) than in the low RPTOR subgroup (15 samples with
  IHCs ≤ 3) in the BM + patients. F, G H1299 and PC9 cell lines were chosen to be
  our experiment cell lines due to their significantly higher RPTOR expression than
  those in other LUAD cell lines. H, I The whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to
  screen different genes from the BM + and BM- groups. A DAGM model was constructed
  to assess the role of somatic variants in the signaling pathways. The ceramide signaling
  pathway was found to be involved in the BM progress
