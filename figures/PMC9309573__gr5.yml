caption: 'The molecular mechanism of 17β-estradiol regulating BMSC. A. Top 20 KEGG
  Pathway heatmap of 17β-estradiol acting on BMSC.The x-axis is the target of the
  KEGG Pathway that 17β-estradiol regulating BMSC. The median frequency of target
  expression is 3.0, and the red font is the target that expression frequency greater
  than 3.0. The y-axis is the KEGG Pathway term. The median frequency of KEGG Pathway
  expression is 5.5, and the blue font is KEGG Pathway with an expression frequency
  greater than 5.5. B. Typical expression bands of Akt and P-Akt protein of BMSCs
  in each group detected by Western blot. C. Comparison of the relative expression
  of Akt and P-Akt proteins. *P＜0.01(n = 3), compare with the control group; #P＜0.01(n = 3),
  compared with the 17β-estradiol group. (For interpretation of the references to
