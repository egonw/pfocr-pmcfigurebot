caption: Illustration of the phenylpropanoid pathway and MRM quantification of main
  participants (cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid) in the
  primed and naïve shoot tissue of barley infected with the fungal pathogen P. teres
  f. teres. The bar graphs were generated using the average integrated peak area (n
  = 9). The error bars represent the standard deviation. Concentrations are expressed
  in µg g−1 (Mean +/− standard deviation; ). The statistical significance of the observed
  differences was evaluated using Student’s t-test, and p values < 0.05 (*) and 0.01
  (**) were considered as significant.
