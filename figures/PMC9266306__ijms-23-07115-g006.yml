caption: Phosphorylation of three MAPK pathway in DSK-treated HSC-3 and SCC-9 cells.
  HSC-3 (A) and SCC-9 (B) cells were treated with indicated concentrations of DSK
  for 6 h and assessed for the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 (ERK), JNK, and p38-MAPK
  by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. Densitometric analyses were quantified
  and normalized with total protein. The values represent the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with untreated controls using Student’s t-test.
