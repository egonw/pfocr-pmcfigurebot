figure_title: Analysis of JNK signaling in fas2 LOF conditions
caption: '(A) Blockade of the JNK signaling pathway (using UAS-bskRNAi #32977) does
  not rescue the fas2 LOF phenotype caused by UAS-fas2RNAi (#34084) expression driven
  by MS1096-GAL4 (double heterozygous females) (compare also with ). (B) Expression
  of UAS-bskRNAi (#57035) ameliorates but does not rescue the reduced eye phenotype
  produced by expression of UAS-fas2RNAi (#34084) in ey-driven FLP-OUT (ey>FLP) individuals
  (compare also with ). (C) Coupled-MARCM fas2eB112 null clones with a blockade of
  JNK function (expressing UAS-bskRNAi, #32977) (green, GFP) display the typical reduced
  size compared to their normal twin controls (mtdTomato). Bar: 50 μm. (D) en-GAL4/+;
  UAS-fas2RNAi#34084/+ wing discs do not show obvious signs of apoptosis using an
  anti-cleaved Caspase3 antibody (red). Bar: 50 μm. (E) Inhibition of Fas2 expression
  in the posterior compartment of the wing disc causes a non-cell autonomous increase
  in JNK pathway activity. Left, the reporter of JNK activity TRE-DsRed (anti-RFP,
  red) shows a weak expression in either the posterior or anterior compartments of
  control wing discs. Right, the expression of fas2RNAi (#34084) in the posterior
  compartment of the wing disc (driven by heterozygous en-GAL4) causes an increase
  of TRE-DsRed expression that also extends into the anterior compartment. Bar: 50
  μm.'
