figure_title: LINC02820 is involved in the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: A The expression of upstream genes of the NF-κB signal pathway. B The changes
  of LINC02820 affected the expression of p65 and its phosphorylation. C, D Nuclear
  and cytoplasmic protein fractions were isolated from ESCC cell lines. E, F The expression
  of p65 and p-p65 in K180 and K30 cells in response to TNFα (20 ng/mL).
article_title: Novel long noncoding RNA LINC02820 augments TNF signaling pathway to
  remodel cytoskeleton and potentiate metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
