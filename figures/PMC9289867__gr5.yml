caption: 'Validation of significant differentially expressed genes and proteins in
  drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 signaling pathway in chick livers between 3 groups.
  (A) Heat maps of 9 significantly differentially expressed genes. (B) The mRNA relative
  expression levels of CYPIA2, FMO3, ADH6, AOX1, UGT1A, GSTT1, MGST1, HPGDS, and GSTA3
  by qPCR. (C) Heat maps of 5 significantly differentially expressed proteins. (D)
  The protein expression levels of CYP1A2, UGT1A1, MGST1, and HPGDS by PRM. Compared
  with the control group, * means P < 0.05, ** means P < 0.01. Compared with the FFC
  group, # means P < 0.05, ## means P < 0.01.'
