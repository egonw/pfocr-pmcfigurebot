caption: ucOCN mitigates the TNF-α-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  (A) Measurement and (B) quantification of intracellular ROS levels with CellROX
  Orange staining. Cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α for 8 hours, with (lower
  panels) or without (middle panels) pretreatment with 0.5 ng/mL ucOCN for 30 minutes.
  Untreated control cells are shown in the upper panels. Nuclear staining is shown
  in blue. Scale bar 100 µm.
