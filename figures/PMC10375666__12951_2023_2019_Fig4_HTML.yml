caption: Functional and disease relationship of differentially expressed miRNAs of
  patients with CSC. A Chord diagram showing the differentially expressed miRNAs connection
  between enriched biological processes (by colors). B Chord diagram showing the differentially
  expressed miRNAs and linking enriched disease association (by colors). C Graphical
  representation of the posttranscriptional network of interactions between the upregulated
  miRNAs and downregulated target genes. Gene ontology clusters of the VEGF signaling
  pathway and tight junction-related pathway are colored. D Network analysis showing
  upregulated miRNA-related diseases. Age-related macular degeneration is highlighted
