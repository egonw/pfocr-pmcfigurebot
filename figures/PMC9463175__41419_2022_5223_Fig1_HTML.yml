figure_title: Expression and prognosis of ZNF276 in breast cancer tissues and cell
  lines
caption: A mRNA expression of ZNF276 in different malignancies and normal tissues
  from TCGA database. BRCA breast carcinoma. CESC Cervical and endocervical carcinoma.
  COAD Colon adenocarcinoma. LIHC Liver hepatocellular carcinoma. LUAD Lung adenocarcinoma.
  STAD Stomach adenocarcinoma. UCEC Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma. B, C RT-qPCR
  (B) and western blot (C) analysis of ZNF276 expression in 10 breast cancer tissues
  and matched surrounding normal tissues. D Representative pictures of ZNF276 expression
  in 118 breast cancer tissues and 48 adjacent tissues from tissue chips. E, F Statistical
  analysis of ZNF276 protein expression in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues
  (E) and different molecular subtypes (F) from tissue chips by H-score. G ZNF276
  mRNA expressions in different breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the CCLE
  portal. H Protein expression of ZNF276 was detected in normal breast cells and six
  breast cancer cells by western blot. I Correlation between ZNF276 expression and
  prognosis of breast cancer patients from TCGA dataset. J Kaplan–Meier curve showing
  the overall survival of 132 breast cancer patients separated by high and low ZNF276
  expression. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
article_title: ZNF276 promotes the malignant phenotype of breast carcinoma by activating
  the CYP1B1-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
