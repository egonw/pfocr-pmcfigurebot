caption: Schematic representation of plausible mechanism shows the potential role
  of GLUT3 in COPD. GLUT3 is positively regulated in bronchial epithelial cells and
  GLUT3-mediated cigarette smoke induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by up-regulating
  the NF-κB/ZEB1 pathway, inducing airway epithelial cells to lose their epithelial
  characteristics with the loss of polarity and junctional proteins. Airway epithelial
  cells acquire mesenchymal features such as a spindle shape and to the ability to
  migrate and secrete matrix proteins. Finally, the extracellular matrix deposition
  causes airway remodelling, ultimately leading to COPD
