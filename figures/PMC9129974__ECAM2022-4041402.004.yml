caption: 'Citrus unshiu peel alleviated the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers
  and NADPH-related proteins. (a) Level of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in serum;
  (b) level of MDA (malondialdehyde) in tissue; (c) expression of NOX2 (NADPH oxidase
  2) and p47phox. Control: control mice, DSS: distilled water administered to ulcerative
  colitis mice, SASP: sulfasalazine 100 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative
  colitis mice, CUPL: CUP 100 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative colitis
  mice, and CUPH: CUP 200 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative colitis mice.
  Data are mean ± SD (n = 8). Significance: ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. control
  mice, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. DSS mice.'
