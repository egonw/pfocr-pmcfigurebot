caption: Subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers associated with metabolic
  comorbidities and clinical features in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. (a) Olink
  Cardiovascular panel III performed in plasmas from PsA patients and healthy donors
  (HDs). Proteins significantly altered in PsA patients compared to HDs. (b) Functional
  classification of the altered levels of CVD‐related molecules in PsA patients by
  STRING platform. (c) Association studies of the altered levels of CVD‐related molecules
  with insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment–insulin resistance [HOMA‐IR]
  >3.07). (d) Association studies of proteome profile with obesity (body mass index
  [BMI] >30). (e) Association studies of the altered levels of CVD‐related molecules
  with the disease activity (DAPSA). (f) Association studies of the altered levels
  of CVD‐related molecules with inflammation (ESR >15 mm/1h and CRP >10 mg/L). (g)
  Association studies of the altered levels of CVD‐related molecules with body surface
  area affected by psoriasis (BSA >10). (h) Association studies of the altered levels
  of CVD‐related molecules with the presence of onychopathy. Line shows significant
  differences (−log10[0.05], p < 0.05). (i) Venn diagram of common and noncommon proteins

  acid binding protein 4; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; TNFRSF10C, TNF receptor
  superfamily member 10c; GDF‐15, growth differentiation factor 15; CTSZ, cathepsin
  Z; AZU‐1, azurocidin 1; TR‐AP (TRAF2), TNF receptor associated factor 2; PI3, peptidase
