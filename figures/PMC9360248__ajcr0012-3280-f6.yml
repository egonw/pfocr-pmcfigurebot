caption: UPR pathway activity. Western blots present the abundance of key proteins
  involved in UPR signaling and its change as a function of drug concentration (bortezomib
  - left panel, carfilzomib - right panel) and time of incubation (2 and 6 hours).
  Bar graphs show the relative quantity of the analyzed proteins.
article_title: Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant myeloma cells show increased
  activity of all three arms of the unfolded protein response.
