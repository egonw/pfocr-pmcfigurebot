caption: The effects of si-hsa_circ_0000847 on cell proliferation and the protein
  expression of PCNA and CyclinD1. (a) si-circRNA reduced the proliferation of HepG2,
  pHBV1.3 + HepG2, and HepG2.2.15 cells. (b-d) si-circRNA reduces the protein expression
  of PCNA and CyclinD1 (n = 3, Mean ± SD, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
