caption: 'Analysis of the mRNA expression levels of the integrin α5, integrin β1,
  β-catenin, N-cadherin, and FAK genes after GN and rGO treatment at 25 µg/mL concentration
  for 24 h in U87 (A) and Hs5 (B) cells. The results are calculated relative to the
  control values. Log2RQ (log2 relative quantitation) values for all genes are normalized
  to the housekeeping gene RPL13A. Statistical significance between the control and
  the treated cells is indicated by an asterisk and was assessed using Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparisons test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically
  significant. One asterisk (*) indicates p < 0.05, two asterisk (**) indicates p
  < 0.01, three asterisk (***) indicates p < 0.001 and four asterisks (****) indicate
  p < 0.0001. Abbreviations: rGO, reduced graphene oxide; GN, graphene; C, control
  group (untreated group); ExF, exfoliation; Term, thermal; ATS, ammonium thiosulfate;
  TUD, thiourea dioxide; rpl13a, ribosomal protein L13a; log2RQ, log2 relative quantitation.'
