caption: HGD/GSTZ1 promotes cell cycle and tumor progression. (Aâ€“C) GSEA pathway enrichment
  analyses of key regulator (HGD, GSTZ1, GOT1, GOT2, SLC2A1, and LDHA) signature in
  patients with RCC from the TCGA datasets. (D) The overlapping analysis for related
  genes of cell cycle in RCC patients. The number represents the number of genes shared
  by different gene sets. (E) The correlation analysis between HGD/GSTZ1/GOT1/GOT2/prognosis
  and cell cycle related target genes. (F) The cell cycle related key target genes
  mRNA expression levels between tumor and normal tissues in patients with KIRC in
  TGCA database.
