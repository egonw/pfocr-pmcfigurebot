caption: Pathway analysis of P3H4 downstream proteins. (A) Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) analysis
  of the differential expression of proteins following P3H4 knockdown. (B) Quantification
  of differential expression of proteins upon P3H4 knockdown. (C) The circular chart
  indicates the location of differentially expressed proteins. (D) Analysis of the
  KEGG pathway of P3H4-regulated proteins. (E) The differential expression of metabolic
  substances based on volcano plot using UHPLC-Q-TOF MS in negative ion mode. (F)
  The differential expression of metabolic substances based on the volcano plot using
  UHPLC-Q-TOF MS in positive ion mode. (G) Bioinformatics analysis of the KEGG pathway
  of differentially expressed metabolic substances following P3H4 knockdown. (H) Analysis
  of the KEGG pathway of comprehensively analyzed the proteomic and metabolomic data
  between P3H4 knockdown + EGFR-OE group and P3H4 knockdown group.
