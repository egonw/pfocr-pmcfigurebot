caption: ITGA5 promoted the growth of gastric cancer cells in vivo. (a) Subcutaneous
  tumor live imaging in nude mice. (b–e) Subcutaneous injection of AGS cells NC and
  AGS overexpressing ITGA5 into nude mice (N = 4); the tumor volume was measured every
  5 days (b). Excision of the tumors 35 days after inoculation of the cells and their
  weight (c). Tumors photographed after their removal (d). Immunohistochemical staining
  revealing ITGA5 expression in transplanted tumors (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001). ITGA5 gene can affect the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells
  and promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells.
