caption: Detection of the Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathway of HUVECs treated by
  F12, hypo-CM and nor-CM with or without cabozantinib. A. Western blotting images
  of AKT, mTOR, MEK, Erk, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, phospho-MEK, phospho-Erk, and
  GAPDH. B. Statistical analysis of the protiens content relative to that of GAPDH.
  The results are presented as mean Â± SD (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).
article_title: Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) loaded with concentrated hypoxic pretreated
