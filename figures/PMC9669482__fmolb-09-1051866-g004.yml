caption: The role of ferroptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma. Oncogenic RAS mutants are the
  key mediator of RMS disease, which can block the ferroptosis of RMS cells induced
  by erastin and RSL3. The complex tris(5-chloro-8-quinolinolato) gallium (III) can
  induce ferroptosis in RMS cells by reducing GPX4 expression, thereby exerting therapeutic
  effects on RMS. The activation of PKC-NOX pathway can participate in the process
  of RMS disease by increasing the ferroptosis resistance of RMS cells. PKC, protein
  kinase C; NOX, NADPH oxidases; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione.
