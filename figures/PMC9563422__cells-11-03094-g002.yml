caption: Combination regimen of PTX and SPA70 inhibits P-gp expression in PTX-resistant
  A549 cells. All the experiments were conducted with 2 nM PTX, 10 μM SPA70, or combined
  usage for 48 h (n = 3). (A) Validation of PTX-resistant A549 cells, indicated as
  P-gp expression, and signaling pathway analysis in both A549 and A549/TR cells upon
  corresponding treatment. “+” indicates combination treatment of PTX and SPA70. Protein
  expression was quantified by blot density as shown in . (B) PXR knockdown decreased
  P-gp expression whereas it increased Tip60 protein expression. “+” indicates combination
  treatment of PTX and SPA70. Protein expressions was quantified by blot density as
  shown in . (C) Rhodamine-123 is a P-gp substrate and indicator for MDR1 transporter
  activity. FACS analysis was carried out in A549/PTX cells and lower accumulation
  of Rh-123 resulting from repressed P-gp was observed in the combination treatment
  group. Rh-123-stained cells were quantified by Modfit LT software and shown as a
  bar graph on the right. (D) ChIP assay was performed to investigate whether combination
  treatment disassociated PXR from MDR1 promoter. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, compared
  with indicated groups.
