caption: 'Subcellular localization and co-localization assays reveal that SGs can
  be either by HC-ProN independently or by StEXA1 and StnCBP coordinately in N. benthamiana.
  a Subcellular localization of StEXA1, StnCBP, HC-ProO, and HC-ProN. b Co-localization
  of HC-ProN with NbDCP1 and NbUBP1. c Co-localization between StEXA1, StnCBP, HC-ProO,
  and HC-ProN. d Co-localization of StEXA1/StnCBP with NbDCP1 and NbUBP1. The fluorescence
  signals were observed using a confocal microscope two days after agroinfiltration
  in N. benthamiana leaves. RFP-EV indicates an empty RFP vector (pK7WGR2) as the
  control. Merge means the overlay of GFP and RFP on single confocal planes. Arrows
  indicate granule-like structures. Scale bar: 20 μm.'
article_title: Susceptibility factor StEXA1 interacts with StnCBP to facilitate potato
  virus Y accumulation through the stress granule-dependent RNA regulatory pathway
  in potato.
