caption: 'Effects of trans-anethole on the serum levels of ALT and AST in lipopolysaccharide-challenged
  broilers. The values are represented as mean (n = 8) with their standard errors.
  Bars with unlike letters means significantly different. Abbreviations: ALT, alanine
  aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase. CON, control group fed with basal
  diet and treated with saline; LPS, group fed with basal diet and treated with lipopolysaccharide;
  LPS+TA400, group fed with 400 mg/kg trans-anethole and treated with lipopolysaccharide;
  LPS+TA600, group fed with 600 mg/kg trans-anethole and treated with lipopolysaccharide.'
article_title: Trans-anethole ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute liver inflammation
  in broilers via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway.
