caption: Simplified diagram of the starch metabolic pathway including miRNAs interacting
  with this pathway, and their regulation in R6 stage caryopsis samples under HDT
  in LaGrue and Cypress. Osa-miR1428e-3p, which is downregulated under HDT in both
  Cypress and LaGrue, inhibits starch accumulation by targeting SnRK1b/c. By phosphorylating,
  SnRK1b/c activates several starch biosynthesis enzymes such as sucrose synthase
  (SUS), invertase (INV), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
  (AGPase), soluble starch synthase (SSS), glycogen bound starch synthase (GBSS) and
  starch branching enzyme (SBE). On the other hand, it inhibits the activity of sucrose
  phosphate synthase (SPS). Osa-miR172, which is upregulated under HDT in Cypress,
  promotes starch biosynthesis by degrading RSR1, a transcription factor that inhibits
  the expression of AGPase, SSS, GBSSI and SBE. Osa-miR1436 and Osa-miR1867, the latter
  of which is upregulated by HDT in Cypress and LaGrue, suppresses starch biosynthesis
  by inhibiting GBSSII. Osa-miR1861 promotes starch biosynthesis by inhibiting Starch
  Binding Domain-Containing Protein 1 (SBDCP1), which is a non-competitive inhibitor
  of SSIIIa. Osa-miR1861 and Osa-miR1432 also promotes starch accumulation by inhibiting
  beta-amylase and alpha amylase, respectively.
