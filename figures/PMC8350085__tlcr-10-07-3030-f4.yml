caption: Results of the GSEA analysis between specimens collected prior and after
  chemotherapy. AMPK signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, hepatocellular carcinoma,
  endocytosis, Wnt signaling pathway, breast cancer, longevity regulating pathway,
  glioma, endometrial cancer and ErbB signaling pathway are enriched in samples after
  platinum therapy, indicated by yellow bars. Activity of TNF signaling pathway, rheumatoid
  arthritis, IL-17 signaling pathway, osteoclast differentiation, Leishmaniasis, parathyroid
  hormone synthesis, secretion and action, MAPK signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor
  signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation
  are enriched in specimens collected from therapy-na√Øve patients, indicated by blue
  bars. Highly significant associations showing P<0.05 after false discovery rate
  (FDR) are highlighted in dark-shaded colors.
