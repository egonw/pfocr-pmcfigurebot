figure_title: Hepatic ChREBP deficiency did not improve HFrD-impaired the glucose
  and lipid homeostasis of male offspring
caption: 'The male offspring in Fig.  were used to complete following assays: (A–C)
  Serum insulin levels (A), fast blood glucose (B) and HOMA-IR index (C) of male offspring.
  (D,F) Expression of protein related to insulin signaling pathway (D) and ChREBP
  and its downstream target protein (F) was determined by Western blot in the liver
  from male offspring. (E) Expression of Chrebpa and Chrebpb mRNA in the liver from
  male offspring was determined by qRT-PCR. (G–J) The serum (G and H) and liver (I
  and J) were conducted triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) quantitative analysis.
  (I) Oil Red O (ORO) staining of liver sections (K). n = 5. Data information: All
  graphs are represented as Mean ± SEM, n: biological replicates. One-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used. *P < 0.05 vs. fWPC group. .'
