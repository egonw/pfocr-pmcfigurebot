figure_title: Schematic overview of SMAD-(in)dependent bone morphogenetic protein
  (BMP) signalling pathway (oversimplification)
caption: Upon BMP ligand binding, specific type I and type II receptors form a heterotetrameric
  complex. The type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which, in turn,
  phosphorylates Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (canonical BMP signalling). Phosphorylated
  Smads propagate the signal via complex formation with Smad4 and translocates into
  the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of BMP-responsive target genes. In
  addition to Smad activation, activated BMP receptor complexes initiates several
  intracellular pathways to modulate BMP-dependent cellular responses like PI3-kinase,
  ERK, RhoA, and MAPK/JNK. Canonical BMP signalling is intracellularly inhibited by
  inhibitory Smads (Smad6, Smad7) and E3 ubiquitin ligases like Smurf1 and Smurf2.
