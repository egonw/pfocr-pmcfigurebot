figure_title: Mitochondrial metabolism is enhanced by Atos
caption: 'ASchematic depicting ATP‐generating pathways in eukaryotic cells: glycolysis,
  the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), fatty acid oxidation (FAO), the TCA cycle,
  and the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (ETC). Blue stars mark
  pths targets. Green indicates individual metabolites with statistically significant
  upregulation in atosPBG compared to the control.B–GCellular metabolites were measured
  by LC–MS‐based untargeted metabolomics from extracts of Stage 11 embryos; biological
  replicates for control n = 5, for atosPBG n = 7. (B) Normalized ATP/ADP ratio values
  are decreased in atosPBG compared to control embryos (P = 0.028). (C‐D,F‐G) Heatmap
  of non‐targeted metabolites in atosPBG compared to wild‐type embryos shown with
  average log2fold change (FC) in the non‐targeted LC‐MS/MS analysis reveals (C) an
  increase in atosPBG in substrates of the dGR/HPR enzyme, including 4‐hydroxy α‐ketoglutarate
  and hydroxyproline (HLP) and a smaller decrease in its products, glycolate and glycerate,
  (D) a significant increase in some dipeptides including those containing hydroxyproline.
  (E) Quantification shows an increase in atosPBG in the pyruvate/glucose ratio (P = 0.035),
  but none for the lactate/glucose ratio (P = 0.65). (F) We observe increases in atosPBG
  in intermediates of mitochondrial fatty acid β‐oxidation (FAO), including different
  carnitine‐conjugated lipids, and (F‐G) a significant increase in ketone body substituents
  compared to the control. Data information: Mean ± SEM, ns=P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ****P < 0.0001. Values in heat maps are obtained from untargeted metabolomic analysis,
  unpaired t‐test (B‐G). See Source Data 1 for Fig 9 and Dataset  for metabolomics
  source data. Source data are available online for this figure.'
