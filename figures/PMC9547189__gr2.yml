caption: 'miR21 regulates the subcellular distribution of YAP in trophoblasts by modulating
  phosphorylation(A) Venn analysis and (B) GO enrichment analysis of biological process
  of mRNAs decreased by miR21 mimic and increased by miR21 inhibitor in HTR8/SVneo
  cells as determined by whole-genome RNA sequencing. HTR8/SVneo cells transfected
  with miR21 mimic or miR21 inhibitor and blank and scramble controls were subjected
  to (C) western blotting of p-MST1/2, MST1, MST2, p-LATS1Thr1079, p-LATS1Ser909,
  LATS1, p-YAP Ser127, p-YAP Ser397, and YAP; (D) western blotting of YAP in cytoplasm
  and nuclei (n = 3 in each group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test;
  ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05 versus mimic NC; #p < 0.05 versus inhibitor NC); (E)
  IF staining of YAP (green), CK7 (red), and DAPI (blue) (scale bar, 50 μm); and (F)
  RT-qPCR of CTGF, AMOTL2, and CTNNB1 (n = 3 in each group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05 versus mimic NC; #p < 0.05
  versus inhibitor NC). (G) Western blotting of p-MST1/2, MST1, MST2, p-LATS1Thr1079,
  LATS1, p-YAP Ser127, and YAP in normal and preeclamptic term placentae; n = 6, two-tailed
  t test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05. (H) Western blotting of YAP in cytoplasm
  and nuclei of normal and PE term placentae; n = 6, two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05.
  (I) FISH of miR21 (red) and IF costaining of YAP (green) in normal (upper) and preeclamptic
  (lower) term placentae. Trophoblasts were stained for CK7 (green) on serial sections,
  and nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (blue); scale bar, 100 μm. (J) RT-qPCR of
  CTGF, AMTOL2, and CTNNB1 in normal and preeclamptic term placentae; n = 6, two-tailed
  t test, ∗p < 0.05. (K) Western blotting of p-MST1/2, MST1, p-LATS1Thr1079, LATS1,
  p-YAPSer127, and YAP in PHTs isolated from normal and preeclamptic term placentae;
  n = 3, two-tailed t test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05. The data are presented
  as the means ± SEMs.'
