caption: Oleanolic acid improves insulin signaling in peripheral tissues through a
  multimolecular mechanism. (1) OA is an activator of the insulin receptor, exerting
  an insulin mimetic role; (2) OA upregulates insulin sensitivity by inhibition of
  the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B and TCPTP; (3) OA increases glucose uptake by activation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway and GLUT-4 translocation; (4) OA also enhances glucose uptake
  and fatty acid oxidation in muscle and liver by activating the ERK1/2-AMPK axis;
  (5) OA preserves the glycogen pool in muscle and liver by stimulating glucokinase
  and repressing the glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase activities.
