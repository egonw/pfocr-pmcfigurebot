caption: 'SDS inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis in an OA-induced fatty liver model. (A)
  The mRNA expression of apoptosis related genes (Caspase-8, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3).
  (B, C) Western blot analysis revealed the levels of Caspase-8, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3
  cleavage. (D, E) ROS levels in chicken primary hepatocytes were determined by FITC-staining
  flow cytometry with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength
  of 525 nm. (F, G) Apoptotic hepatocytes were detected by annexin V-FITC/PI-staining
  flow cytometry. Abbreviations: NC, negative control; OA, oleic acid; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species. Replications = 3. Bars represent SEM; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
article_title: Dietary supplementation of salidroside alleviates liver lipid metabolism
  disorder and inflammatory response to promote hepatocyte regeneration via PI3K/AKT/Gsk3-β
  pathway.
