caption: Identification of differentiated expressed genes (DEGs) in medaka gill after
  seawater (SW) to 50% seawater transfer (SFW). (A) Venn diagram showing the comparison
  between SW and SFW. There were 24,746 transcripts identified as common counts. (B)
  Volcano plot showing 198 up-regulated DEGs and 320 down-regulated DEGs in the SW/SFW
  group. Red dots indicate the up-regulated genes, while blue represent the down-regulated.
  Non-DEGs were marked as grey dots. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) of DEGs after the transfer.
  The enriched GO terms were classified into biological process (BP, red), cellular
  component (CC, blue), and molecular function (MF, green). The top enriched terms
  were cellular process in BP; cell in CC; and binding in MF.
