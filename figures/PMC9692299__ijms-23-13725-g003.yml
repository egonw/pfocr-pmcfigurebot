caption: Putative mechanism underlying the effect of rs3209896 from the 3′UTR of AKR1C3
  gene. (A) Before the treatment with selenium-containing preparations, the expression
  of this gene in a human primary cell line (HUVEC) is at a background level (dashed
  arrow); (B) selenium preparations can activate either FAK/PI3K/AKT or redox signaling
  pathway, resulting in binding of transcription factors with their sites in the AKR1C3
  regulatory region, and triggers transcription (solid arrow). The mRNA molecules
  carrying rs3209896 allele A bind miR-4290 or miR-4687-5p in the MRE site of 3′UTR,
  thereby decreasing the mRNA copy number as a result of degradation.
