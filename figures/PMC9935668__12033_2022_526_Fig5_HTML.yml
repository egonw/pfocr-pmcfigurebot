caption: 'Construction of ICI score. A Alluvial plots of ICI gene cluster distribution
  in groups of different ICI clusters, ICI scores, and survival outcomes. B–C Enrichment
  analysis of two signature genes related to ICI: ICI signature genes A and B, including
  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (B) and KEGG analysis (C). The genes were enriched in
  microvillus organization, the cluster of actin-based cell projections, cortical
  actin cytoskeleton, actin binding, actin filament binding, steroid hormone receptor
  activity, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. D–E GSVA analysis of immune
  sub-component type in the TCGA-ESCA data set (MsigDb) (D) and immune-related gene
  set (E). The genes were enriched in the negative regulation of mast cell activation
  related to the immune response, NK cells, breast cancer, cellular extravasation,
  and immune-related aspects. F Enrichment of subgroups with high ICI scores. G Enrichment
  of subgroups with low ICI scores. GSEA suggested that the high ICI score subgroup
  was enriched in E2F targets, G2M checkpoint and MYC targets, while the low ICI score
  subgroup was enriched in IL6/JAK/STAT3 and KRAS signaling pathway, inflammatory
  response, and other immune-related collections'
