caption: 'Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of liver between patients with PNAHS
  (n = 10) and controls (n = 8).A–B, Principal component analysis scatter plots. The
  horizontal coordinate PC1 and vertical coordinate PC2 respectively represent the
  scores of the first and second principal components. Each scatter represents a sample,
  and the color and shape of the scatter represent the 95% confidence intervals (Hoteling’s
  T-squared ellipse) of different grouped samples. C–D, Heat maps of representative
  proteins/phosphosites significantly altered among the 2 groups. Colored boxes represent
  upregulation (red) and downregulation (blue) in the PNAHS group. The color scale
  (upper-right) indicates the fold-change in protein/phosphosite expression for all
  samples. E, K, Volcano plots showing the P-value (y-axis) and fold-change (x-axis)
  of the quantified proteins/phosphosites identified in the proteomic and phosphoproteomic
  analyses (the proteins/phosphosites that showed significant downregulation and upregulation
  are reported in blue and red, respectively). F, L, Bubble diagrams showing the KEGG
  metabolic pathway enrichment analyses for the proteome/phosphoproteome. The horizontal
  axis shows the Rich factor (degree of enrichment), and the vertical axis shows the
  KEGG pathway information. The size of the circle represents the number of differentially
  expressed peptide-dependent proteins in the mapping pathway: the larger the circle,
  the greater the number of peptide-dependent proteins. The color of the circle indicates
  the magnitude of the corrected P-value: the redder the color, the smaller the P-value.
  The metabolic pathways enriched in both the proteome and phosphoproteome are circled
  in red, and the metabolic pathways enriched only in the phosphoproteome are circled
  in blue. G–J, Heat maps of the proteins significantly altered among the 2 groups
  that were associated with peroxisome, fatty acid metabolic processes, fatty acid
  catabolic processes, and oxidative phosphorylation, respectively. Colored boxes
  represent upregulation (red) and downregulation (blue) in the PNAHS group. (PNAHS,
  n = 10; control, n = 8).'
