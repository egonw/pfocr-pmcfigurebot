caption: 'Bioinformatics prediction for possible target signaling pathways of COS
  in osteosarcoma. A 2D and 3D structure of COS. B A PPI network for possible target
  genes of COS was constructed to obtain possible edges by using STRING database.
  C 104 possible target genes were screened using Cytoscape software. D–F The intersection
  between COS target genes and human osteosarcoma-related genes was analyzed. G The
  primary associated pathways were screened from a key network of COS by KEGG pathway
  analysis. Abbreviations: PPI, protein–protein Interaction; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; COS, Chitosan oligosaccharide'
article_title: Chitosan oligosaccharide suppresses osteosarcoma malignancy by inhibiting
  CEMIP via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
