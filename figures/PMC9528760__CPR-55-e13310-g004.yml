caption: GDF11 treatment significantly affects mRNA expression levels of mature 3T3‐L1
  adipocytes. (A) Schematic figure illustrating 3T3‐L1 cell line differentiating protocol
  and GDF11 treatment regimen. (B) Volcano plot of DESeq2 results with independent
  filtering. Maximum of 20 most differentially expressed genes (by adjusted p value
  of <0.05) are named. (C) Computational Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of our
  statistically significant deregulated genes to uncover the most affected cellular
  biological processes (D) Heat map showing differences in mRNA expression levels
  in mature 3T3‐l1 adipocytes treated for 12 h with GDF11 and ALK5/β‐catenin inhibitors
  (at least n = 3 per group). (E) Graphical representation of gene interactions by
  STRING pathway analysis of Top 50 significantly (p ≤ 0.01) deregulated genes. Connections
  between genes are indicating annotated, high confidence (>0.7) molecular interactions.
