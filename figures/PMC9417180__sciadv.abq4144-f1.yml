figure_title: Structure and function of TET ribozyme
caption: (A) Schematic of the secondary structure TET. Paired regions (P) and junctions
  (J) are named using conventional nomenclature. Gray and colored boxes highlight
  core and peripheral domains, respectively. IGS, internal guide sequence. Inset shows
  secondary structure of domains in the proximity of P7. (B) Simplified catalytic
  cycle of multiturnover TET ribozyme. For brevity, multiple processes are illustrated
  as single steps. For a detailed mechanistic description, see (). (1) Oligo substrate
  anneals to internal guide sequence to form P1 and exogenous guanosine binds to pocket
  in P7. (2) P1 docks into the core. (3) Phosphoryl transfer between guanosine nucleophile
  and oligo substrate and undocking of P1. (4) Release of products to regenerate apo
  ribozyme. Colors as in (A). (C) Published cryo-EM structure of apo L-21 Sca I TET
  ribozyme in its native folded state [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 7ez0]. P7, P3,
  P8, J8/7, and J7/3 are shown in cartoon representation and colored as in (A). (D)
  Simplified folding pathway of TET ribozyme at 25Â°C in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+.
  U is the unfolded state. Itrap is hypothesized to be a largely structured misfolded
  intermediate (). Icommitment is a common intermediate that precedes commitment to
  pathways leading to N or M ().
