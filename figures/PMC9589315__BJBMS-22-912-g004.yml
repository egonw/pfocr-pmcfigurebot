caption: 'Identification of hub genes and their expression patterns in CRC cancer
  development in TCGA dataset. (A) The bar plot shows results of the GSEA analysis
  in CRC development; (B) the volcano map presents the CRC-related differential gene
  distribution; (C) the overall-survival analysis in response to C1QC based on the
  TCGA database. The survival curve is based on survival and survminer functions.
  The optimal cutoff values of multiple gene variables are calculated by an automatic
  cut-off algorithm, and the survival curve is drawn; (D) summary of GSEA analysis
  of TCGA differential genes: In C7, the immune signature analysis involved in neutrophil
  activation mainly enriched GSE22886 NEUTROPHIL VS DC UP, GSE22886 NAIVE BCELL VS
  NEUTROPHIL UP and GSE22886 NEUTROPHIL VS MONOCYTE UP core pathways. Further validation
  of neutrophil activation in the progression of colon cancer; and (E-G) the biological
  process, targeted drugs, and pathway enrichment analysis for C1QC.'
