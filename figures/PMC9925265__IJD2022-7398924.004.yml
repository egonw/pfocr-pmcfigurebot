caption: 'Effects of EA on the LPS induced NF-κB and MAPKs'' signaling pathway in
  ST2. (a) E. coli-LPS (1 μg/mL) is applied to ST2 cells and collected at several
  time points. NF-κB p65 and MAPKs (JNK and p38) in ST2 cells are analyzed by Western
  blotting. β-actin is used as a loading control. (b) EA: Equisetum arvense extract
  (3 μg/mL) is pretreated in ST2 cells for 30 minutes, and then E. coli-LPS (1 μg/mL)
  is additionally applied to ST2 cells. IKKα/β, NF-κB p65, and MAPKs (JNK and p38)
  in ST2 cells are assessed at 30 minutes by Western blotting. β-actin is used as
  the loading control.'
