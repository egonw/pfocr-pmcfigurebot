caption: (A) Schematic of the canonical BMP signaling pathway in Drosophila, noting
  the direct activation arm via BMP-AE and the default repression arm via BMP-SE to
  repress the brk transcriptional repressor. (B) Schematic of the RNA-seq experiment
  to examine differential gene expression (DE) between control and wit null VNCs,
  with the brain lobes removed. (C) The number of genes that were downregulated (blue),
  upregulated (red) or not affected (gray) in wit nulls. (D) PANTHER Gene Ontology
  (GO) over-representation analysis for the 637 genes upregulated by BMP signaling.
  The number of over-represented genes within each term are provided next to each
  bar. The fold enrichment is the −log10(P-value). (E) A neurotransmission network
  of 453 genes is shown, with blue and red nodes indicating genes that are BMP-upregulated
  and downregulated, respectively. The color intensity of the nodes defines the log2
  (fold change) of DE. All wit-unresponsive genes are indicated as a single central
  white node. Genes are classified based on their function as shown beside the network.
  Four major interaction clusters are shown (I–IV). (F) Bar graph showing the proportion
  of wit-responsive genes in each functional category shown in panel (E). (G) Disease
  to gene interaction network for the 1086 putative human orthologs using DisGeNET
  analysis.
