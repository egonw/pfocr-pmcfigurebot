figure_title: Effect of pharmacological manipulations of Tlr9 and GAS/STING pathways
  on CFC
caption: 'a Cannula localization and individual placements (left). Dose-dependent
  impairment of CFC by pharmacological inhibition of Tlr9 with ODN2088 (4 nmol/mouse
  n = 8; 8 nmol/mouse n = 7, vehicle n = 17; middle, two-way ANOVA RM, Factor: Drug,
  p = 0.0238, F(2,29) = 4.2630, Factor: Test, p < 0.0001, F(1.860,53.54) = 12.66,
  Drug × Test, p = 0.0748, F(4,58) = 2.249), and lack of effect of the GAS and STING
  inhibitors RU-521 (n = 8 mice/group) and H-151 (n = 8 mice/group), respectively
  (right, two-way ANOVA RM, Factor: Drug, p = 0.1096, F(2,34) = 2.361, Factor: Test,
  p = 0.1708, F(1,34) = 1.958, Drug × Test, p = 0.6029, F(2,34) = 0.5136). b Intact
  CFC in STING knockout mice (n = 7 mice/group) versus WT littermates (n = 5 mice/group;
  two-way ANOVA RM, Factor: Genotype, p = 0.5132, F(1,10) = 0.4596, Factor: Test,
  p = 0.4794, F(1,10) = 0.5398, Genotype × Test, p = 0.7141, F(1,10) = 0.1421). c
  Impaired CFC after dorso-hippocampal injection of DNAse2 shRNA (n = 7 mice/group)
  when compared to scrambled shRNA (n = 7 mice/group; two-way ANOVA, Factor: Virus,
  p < 0.0001, F(1,36) = 48.02, Factor: Test, p = 0.3667, F(2,36) = 1.032, Virus ×
  Test, p = 0.6051, F(2,36) = 0.5094). d Overexpression of TREX1 (n = 8 mice/group)
  did not affect CFC when compared to the GFP control (n = 7 mice/group; two-way ANOVA,
  Factor: Virus, p = 0.3918, F(1,39) = 0.7500, Factor: Test, p = 0.2407, F(2,39) = 1.478,
  Virus × Test, p = 0.4763, F(2,39) = 0.7559). Data represented as mean ± s.e.m.,
