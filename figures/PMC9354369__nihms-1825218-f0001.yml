figure_title: Metabolomics and exposomics facilitate discovery
caption: Metabolomics (pink shading, bottom) focuses on measures of endogenous small
  molecules as outputs of metabolic pathways. Perturbations in the ‘omics’ layers
  can lead to changes in metabolite profiles linked with phenotypes. Exposomics (blue
  shading, top) expands on this to include measurements of exogenous small molecules
  as well as the influence of exogenous and non-genetic factors on the ‘omics’ cascade
  that can lead to changes in metabolite profiles linked with phenotype. The timing
  of sample collection relative to phenotype characterization helps determine whether
  the metabolite biomarker or pathway is linked to etiology, diagnosis, or progression
  of disease.
