caption: 'Analysis of neuronal markers by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. a Fluorescent
  immunocytochemistry showing MAP2-positive cells (green) and NFH-positive cells (red)
  following HDAC inhibitor treatment compared to the control and RA treated cells.
  DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei of cells. The scale bar represents 20 μm.
  b The number of positive cells that expressed MAP2 and NFH was measured. The ratio
  of positive cells to nuclei was calculated for each group (n = 4). All experiments
  were repeated at least three times. ***p < 0.001 compared to the control group,
  #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 compared to the RA group'
