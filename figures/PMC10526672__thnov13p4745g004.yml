caption: Alterations to DNA-damage repair pathways and role of DNA-PK inhibition in
  sensitivity to LuTate. A) Heat map of p-value change for DNA-damage repair pathway
  genes between control and LuTate treated cells in the sensitivity arm of the CRISPR
  screen. Genes are grouped by pathway and ranked within each group from least significant
  (yellow, p-value >0.05) to most significant (blue, p-value <0.005) by the p-value
  of the control group. B and C) Cell growth response at Day 14, shown as % relative
  growth as compared to control of H1299-7 cells treated with 0, 5 or 10 MBq/mL LuTate
  alone, or in combination with 0.5 μM or 1 μM of DNA-PK inhibitor nedisertib (B)
  or AZD-7648 (C). D) Cell growth response at Day 14, shown as % relative growth as
  compared to control of AR42J cells treated with 0, 5 or 10 MBq/mL LuTate alone,
  or in combination with 0.5 μM or 1 μM of DNA-PK inhibitor nedisertib.
