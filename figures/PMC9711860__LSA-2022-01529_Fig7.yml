figure_title: Illustration of how loss of cell–cell adhesion triggers cell migration
caption: Tiam1 is localized at cell–cell junctions and important for establishment
  and maintenance of these structures. Upon loss of cell–cell adhesion, Tiam1 is released
  from cell–cell junctions and activates Rac1, which then serves as a major molecular
  switch to turn on the cellular “migratory machinery” through NOX-mediated ROS generation.
  The ROS–Src–STAT3 signaling pathway that leads to vimentin expression is important
  for cell migration.
