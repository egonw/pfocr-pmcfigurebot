caption: 'AhR translocation experiments after 5 hours of incubation (+3 hours pro-inflammatory
  stimulation). Bar graphs show AhR immunofluorescence as T/IL-1β C for (A) whole
  cells, (B) the cytosolic, and (C) nuclear fraction, and (D) the ratio of nucleus/cytosol.
  Images (a–d) show AhR (red) and nuclei (blue), images (e–h) show NF-κB p65 (red)
  and nuclei (blue) of HCEC when exposed to the following conditions: (a) solvent
  control, (b) 25 ng/mL IL-1β, (c) 1 μM B[a]P, and (d) 10 μM AOH for a total of 5
  h (toxins). Bar graphs depict immunofluorescence data of AhR (A–D) presented as
  means + SD normalized to the IL-1β control of a minimum of four individual experiments
  conducted, including at least technical duplicates in each and four optical fields.
  Significant differences compared to the stimulus control were calculated applying
  a two-sample t-test and are highlighted as the following: * (p < 0.05), ** (p <
  0.01), and *** (p < 0.001). # represents significant differences compared to the
  solvent control (at p < 0.05). All images were taken using a 20× objective; therefore,
  the indicated scale bar applies to all images depicted.'
