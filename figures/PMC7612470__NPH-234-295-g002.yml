caption: Shade adaptation in Begonia. (a) False‐color images representing maximum
  photochemical efficiency of PSII (F v/F m) under growth light conditions in four
  different Begonia species. The false‐color scale ranges from black (0) to red (1)
  as indicated below the false‐color images. Light‐response curves of PSII quantum
  yield (ΦPSII) (b) and electron transport rate of PSI (ETRI) (c) of four Begonias
  and Gerbera hybrida. Four biological replicates were performed in all experiments,
  and values are given as mean ± SD. (d) Simplified overview of the signal transduction
  pathway of shade adaptation response modified from Gommers et al. () and Podolec
  & Ulm (). Arrows and blunt arrows indicate positive and negative regulations, respectively.
  The expansion genes in Begonia are labeled in red. Full names of gene abbreviations
  are given in Table S17. (e) Phylogenetic tree of light‐harvesting Chla/b‐binding
  protein (LHC) superfamily show expansion of LHCB in two shade Begonias. Branch of
  LHCB1 in gray shows prominent expansion. Numbers corresponding to different species
  are shown beside each subfamily. (f) Expression patterns of photoreceptors and LHCB1
  family genes under light and dark treatment. The lineage‐specific whole‐genome duplication
  retained genes are labeled in bold, and genes marked by an asterisk are derived
  from tandem duplication.
