caption: 'SF MNs alter the mechanical communication between fibroblasts and the surrounding
  matrix and result in a cascade of cellular responses. (A) Illustration of SF MN
  interrupting the mechanical communication between fibroblasts and the ECM to prevent
  fibroblast activation and promoting ECM remodeling with reduced secretions of collagen
  I and fibronectin via the integrin–FAK signaling pathway. (B) Western blotting of
  integrin, FAK, RhoA, and F-actin assembly, as well as type I collagen and fibronectin
  involved in the ECM network in fibroblasts with the treatment of FAKI, SF MNs, and
  FAKI + SF MNs. (C) Semiquantitative statistics of protein levels from Western blotting
  of (B). ##p < 0.001, n = 3. (D) CLSM of the intracellular F-actin meshwork of fibroblasts
  under different treatments. Blue signals: nucleus; green signals: F-actin. Scale
  bar, 100 μm.'
