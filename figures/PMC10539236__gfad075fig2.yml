caption: In late stages of proteinuric CKD, vascularization is rarefied but does not
  induce major hypoxia. (A) Representative serial sections of control (CTL) and POD-ATTAC
  mice 28 days after repeated injections of dimerizer (POD). In the left panel, Sirius
  Red staining and in the right panel, pimonidazole immunohistochemistry. (B) Representative
  immunoblot of kidney cortex in CTL (n = 6) and POD (n = 5) mice for HIF-1α and GLUT1
  and corresponding loading control (Ponceau S staining). (C) RNA sequencing analysis
  in CTL (n = 3) and POD mice (n = 3) and corresponding heatmap of PROGENy pathways
  (hypoxia, NF-κB, TGFβ, MAPK, TNFα, PI3K). (D) Representative visualization of renal
  microvascularization assessed by micro-CT imaging following contrast agent perfusion.
  (E) Percentage of kidney tissue within 20 μm or 100 μm of the closest blood vessel,
  quantified by micro-CT following contrast agent perfusion, in CTL (n = 7) and POD
  (n = 5) kidneys. *P < .05. (F) In the ex vivo perfused kidney setup, renal oxygen
  consumption (VO2) in CTL (n = 4) and POD (n = 6) kidneys. *P < .05. (G) Hypoxia
  PROGENy pathway in human FACS sorted PDGFRb-positive analysed by scRNAseq indicating
  a global deactivation of the pathway in CKD (P = .002). Results are presented with
  error bars showing mean ± standard deviation.
