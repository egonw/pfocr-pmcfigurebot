caption: Melatonin inhibits ubiquitination of IκBα to prevent entry of NF-κB to the
  nucleus. (A) Western blot using an anti-ubiquitin antibody showing that melatonin
  inhibited ubiquitination in M1 phenotype PRMs in a dose-dependent manner. (B) Ubiquitination,
  accumulation, and expression of IkBα and entry of NF-κB (p50/p65) into the nucleus
  were confirmed by western blotting. The results demonstrated melatonin, similar
  to MG132, blocked proteasomal degradation of IκBα and consequently prevented activation
  of the NF-κB pathway in M1 phenotype PRMs. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis of accumulation
  and expression of IkBα, NF-κB (p50), and the proteasome in PRMs before and after
  various treatments. Scale bar=20 μm. (D and E) Ratio of fluorescence in the cytoplasm
  versus the nucleus was quantified for IκBα and NF-κB1 (p50). *P < 0.05. (F) Amounts
  of NF-κB1 (p50) enriched within the promoter region of specific miRNAs in variously
  treated PRMs were quantified by ChIP-coupled real-time PCR. The percentages of input
  were calculated in accordance with the threshold cycle values. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
