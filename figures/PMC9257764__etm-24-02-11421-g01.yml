caption: AMPK signaling pathway in dyslipidemia. AMPK regulates lipid metabolism by
  inhibiting the expression of FAS, decreasing the activity of HMGCR and ACC, and
  increasing the activity of CPT1. Arrows represent stimulatory modifications. T-shaped
  arrows represent inhibitory modifications. The picture was generated using Adobe
  Illustrator CC version 23.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). APN, adiponectin; AdipoR, adiponectin
  receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3,
