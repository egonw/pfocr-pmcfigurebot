figure_title: HDAC7 is essential for WNT5A-mediated ESCC cell migration and invasion
caption: 'A Representative western blots showing the levels of FLAG-WNT5A, HDAC7,
  SNAIL, E-cadherin, and vimentin in EC109 cells with WNT5A overexpression and/or
  HDAC7 knockdown. β-actin was used as an internal control. B, C Representative images
  and statistical analysis of wound healing assays and Transwell migration/invasion
  assays in the indicated ESCC cells. The migratory ability in wound healing assays
  was expressed as the mean scratch area. The initial scratch area (0 h) was set to
  100%. *P < 0.05 compared with the LV-Control + shControl group, #P < 0.05 compared
  with the LV-FLAG-WNT5A + shControl group, and &P < 0.05 compared with the LV-Control + shHDAC7
  group. LV lentivirus.'
