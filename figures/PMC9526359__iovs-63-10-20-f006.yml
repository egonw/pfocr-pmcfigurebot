caption: Effect of inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on inflammation in
  experimental FK. (A, B) Western blot analysis confirmed that the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway was inhibited after the addition of LY294002. (C) The mRNA levels of IL-6,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α were significantly downregulated in the FS+LY294002 group compared
  to the FS group. (D) The CCK-8 assay showed that the activity of corneal stromal
  cells was significantly higher in LY294002-treated mice than in the control group.
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001; n = 6.
