caption: Pathways involved in formation of cilia and wound healing in our EC vs. NS
  set identified using IPA. (a) “Formation of Cilia” generated by overlaying our data
  on the cigarette smoke literature. (b) “Wound Healing Signaling Pathway” generated
  by overlaying our data on the EC literature. Upregulated DEGs are pink-to-red depending
  on fold-change, whereas green DEGs indicate downregulation. Orange arrows represent
  predicted activation, yellow arrows indicate non-consistent activation, and grey
  arrows represent effect not predicted.
