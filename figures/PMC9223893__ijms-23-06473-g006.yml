caption: Higher RvD scores distinguish tumors with increased activation state in selected
  immune cells. (A) HNSC bulk RNA-seq were analyzed with the gene expression module
  of CIBERSORT to impute cell type specific expression profiles of 10 human immune
  subsets (LM10). The heatmap, generated with BioVinci, shows the gene expression
  profile of immune cells in tumors with high (blue rectangles) vs. low (red rectangles)
  RvD score. (B) IPA findings of biological functions (Fx) and canonical pathways
  (CP) associated with T lymphocytes activation and functions. (C) IPA findings of
  molecular network associated with increased lymphocyte cytotoxicity in RvD high
  score HNSC. (D) Cumulative CD8+ T cell cytolytic score in in high (n = 100) vs.
  low (n = 100) RvD score tumors. Data are shown as bars calculated on RSEM gene normalized
  values. ****, p < 0.0001, Student t test. (E) Mean gene expression levels (RSEM
  gene normalized values) of immunotherapy targets in CD8+ T cells stratified as high
  (n = 100) and low (n = 100) accordingly to their RvD score. ****, p < 0.0001, two-way
  ANOVA and Sidakâ€™s multiple comparisons test. (F) IPA findings of biological functions
  associated with PMN activities.
