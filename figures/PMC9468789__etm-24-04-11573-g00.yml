caption: 'Effects of metformin on the formation of foam cells. (A and B) Cell viability
  was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. (C) The formation of foam cells was detected by
  Oil Red O staining. (D) The levels of cholesterol ester/total cholesterol in ox-LDL-treated
  macrophages were detected by a commercial tissue cell free cholesterol enzymatic
  assay kit and a tissue cell total cholesterol enzymatic determination kit. (E) Cholesterol
  uptake, detected by the dil-ox-LDL assay. Scale bar=50 µM. *P<0.05 vs. the control
  group, **P<0.01 vs. the control group, ***P<0.001 vs. the PMA group, #P<0.05 vs.
  the ox-LDL group. CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  dil-ox-LDL, dil-labeled-ox-LDL; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
