caption: 'A summary diagram of integrin-based cardiovascular disease treatment methods
  and therapeutic drugs. (A) The use of integrin antagonists to block the binding
  of integrins with ligands, thereby inhibiting signal pathway transmission and CVD
  progression. (B) The use of NPs to enhance targeting specificity and bioavailability,
  delay drug release, and mitigate drug toxicity in the treatment of CVDs. Abbreviations:
  CVD: cardiovascular disease, VEC: vascular endothelial cell, VSMC: vascular smooth
  muscle cell, VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor, NP: nanoparticle, RGD-peptide:
  arginine–glycine–aspartate peptide, RAP: rapamycin, cRGDfK peptide: cyclic arginyl–glycyl–aspartic
  acid–phenylalanine–lysine peptide, PLGA-Pep-PEG: poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)–peptide–polyethylene
  glycol, RGDfC: Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Cys, RAP@T/R NPs: RAP targeted and responsive nanoparticles.'
