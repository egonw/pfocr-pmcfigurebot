caption: 'MSCs-Exo treatment ameliorates cognitive impairment in dNCR mice. The mice
  were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo group,
  and dNCR+Fer-1 group. (a) Escape latency during the MWM navigation test. (b) The
  representative trajectory diagrams of the swimming distance to find the platform
  (blue dots: starting position; yellow dots: ending position). (c) The platform-crossing
  times in the MWM test. (d) The time spent in the target quadrant during the MWM
  test. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, Sham vs. dNCR; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, dNCR vs. dNCR+MSCs-Exo; @P
  < 0.05 and @@P < 0.01, dNCR vs. dNCR+Fer-1. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis
  inhibitor.'
