caption: High‐rank differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and the complex linkage
  network correlated to Alzheimer's disease (AD) like β‐amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathologies
  in brain and platelet. (A) Pie chart showing the proportion of molecules correlated
  with Aβ, tau, or Aβ and tau. (B) Specific molecules correlated with Aβ, tau, or
  Aβ and tau. (C) A regulatory network of AD pathologically related differential molecules,
  and the size of the circle indicates its importance in the pathogenic network. (D)
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and wiki pathway enriched in AD pathology‐related
  proteins. The X‐axis represents the rich factor, the bubble size represents the
  number of targets enriched in terms, and the color indicates the p‐value
article_title: Integrated analyses of brain and platelet omics reveal their common
  altered and driven molecules in Alzheimer's disease.
