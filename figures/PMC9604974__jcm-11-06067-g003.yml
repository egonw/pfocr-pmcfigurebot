caption: 'Mutation of circulating tumor cells detected by next-generation sequencing.
  For patient 1: (A) The overview of the somatic mutational profiles of CTCs. Chromosomes
  are presented in the outermost circle clockwise. The blue histograms indicate the
  log-transformed sequencing depth, setting 1 Mbp as a unit. The blue points show
  the number of SNPs in each chromosome. The following orange histograms suggest the
  relative proportion of homologous SNPs; the grey area in this ring refers to heterozygous
  SNPs. The red points stand for the number of indel mutations in each chromosome.
  The innermost circle shows the proportion of homologous or heterozygous indel mutations;
  red histograms refer to homologous mutations and the grey area refers to heterozygous
  mutations. (B) The distribution of CTC mutations. For patient 2. (C) The overview
  of the somatic mutational profiles of CTCs. (D) The distribution of CTC mutations.
  (E) Gene ontology biological process, and (F) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in
  circulating tumor cells. Abbreviation: SNPâ€”single-nucleotide polymorph.'
