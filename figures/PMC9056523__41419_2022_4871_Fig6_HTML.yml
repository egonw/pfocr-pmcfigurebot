figure_title: has-miRNA-3163 was involved in MAX3A mediated regulation of SCIN in
  nasopharyngeal carcinoma
caption: A The intersected miRNAs were predicted from two datasets (miRDB and Targetscan).
  B Indicated miRNAs levels in shCtrl and shMEX3A stable C666-1 and HONE-1 cell lines
  were determined by RT-qPCR. C SCIN mRNA levels were detected by RT-qPCR after the
  negative control (NC), miRNA-3163 mimics or miRNA-3163 inhibitor transfected into
  C666-1 and HONE-1 cells. D A schematic diagram representing the predicted binding
  sites for miRNA-3163, MEX3A and SCIN. E Direct binding between miRNA-3163 and MEX3A
  was assessed by dual-luciferase assay after C666-1 cells were co-transfected with
  the NC, miRNA-3163 mimics, and wild-type (WT) or mutant (Mut) MEX3A luciferase reporter
  vectors. F Direct binding between miRNA-3163 and SCIN was assessed by dual-luciferase
  assay. G The effects of miRNA-3163 inhibition, MEX3A knockdown, and simultaneous
  MEX3A knockdown plus miRNA-3163 inhibition on the proliferation rates of C666-1
  cells were determined by CCK-8 assay. H, I Wound healing and transwell assays were
  conducted to assess the migration and invasion abilities of cells under the indicated
  treatments. J The apoptosis rates of C666-1 cells under the indicated treatments
  were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
