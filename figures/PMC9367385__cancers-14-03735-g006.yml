caption: 'SH3TC2 knockdown regulates cell apoptosis via MAPK pathway. (A) Western
  blot analysis implied that MAPK8, 9, 13, and 14 were significantly inhibited after
  the stable knockdown of SH3TC2. (B) Analysis of clinical samples implied that expression
  of SH3TC2 was positively correlated with MAPK 8, 9, and 13. However, no statistical
  significance was found for MAPK14. (C) The implementation of MAPK8 activator significantly
  upregulated MAPK8 and p-MAPK8. (D) The rescue of MAPK8 partially reversed cell apoptosis
  of SH3TC2 stable knockdown cells. Unless specially marked specially, statistical
  analysis was compared to the blank or control group: ns, not significant; * p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
