caption: 'Effects of YOH on cell migration and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in PDGF-BB-stimulated
  MOVAS-1 cells. (A) MOVAS-1 cell monolayers were scratched and then preincubated
  without (a) or with 0.1% DMSO (b) or YOH ((c) 10 or (d) 20 μM) for 45 min and then
  treated with PDGF (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. The quantified wound closure area (%) is
  shown in (e). (B) (a) Protein expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated
  through Western blotting. (b) Complied statistical data are presented on the right.
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with the resting group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01
  compared with the positive group. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 4).'
