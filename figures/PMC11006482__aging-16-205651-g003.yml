caption: miR-31-5p antagomir contributed to the damage of DSS to colon in mice. (A)
  Analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) from colonic samples (x200 magnification).
  (B) DAI scores. (C) Colon lengths were presented. (D) Statistics of colon length.
  (E) Histological scores based on HE staining method. Each bar represents mean ±
  SD, n ≥ 3 from each group. ns represented P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. DSS group.
