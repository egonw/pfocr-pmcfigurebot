caption: '(A) Left: principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the total (left), differentially
  expressed (DE) (middle), and purity annotated (right) PCO-94 transcriptomes. Clustering
  by PAM is shown. Annotation for purity by deconvolution analysis is shown (“mixed“
  if largest fraction <75%).(B) Top gene sets correlated with principal coordinates
  1 and 2 of the PCO-94 PCoA. Signatures from the C2 “curated,“ C5 “Gene Ontology,“
  and H “hallmark“ gene sets from the mSigDB collection. Ranking by Pearson correlation
  “r“ of ssGSEA scores and coordinate values is shown. Black triangle, negative correlation;
  blank triangle, positive correlation.(C) Normalized enrichment score (NES) heatmap
  of GSEA of the three clusters. Cell lineage, subsets of human prostate epithelial
  cells defined by scRNA-seq; EMT, MCF-10A breast cancer (BRCA) cells undergoing EMT
  (). MMH-RT hepatocytes response to TGF-β are shown (). Response of Ras-transformed
  EpH4 BRCA cells to TGF-β is shown (). GBM, molecular subtypes; BRCA, molecular subtypes
  (). Ras + mut p53 and integrin pathway from the MSigDB is shown.(D) PRC1 signature
  “genes upregulated by RNF2“ and PRC2 signature PRC2_EZH2_UP.V1_UP (M2737) are from
  the MSigDB ().(E and F) Predicted relative fractions (0–1) of ARPC (cluster 1, blue
  color), MSPC (cluster 2, red), and NEPC (cluster 3, green) in the indicated PDXs
  (E) and organoids (F; left). Immunoblots (IBs) of PDXs (E) and organoids (F) are
  shown (right). </p/>(G and H) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (G) and immunofluorescence
  (IF) (H) of the indicated PDXs (G) and organoids (H). Representative fields are
  shown. Scale bars represent 100 μm (G) and 10 μm (H). Pie charts indicate the relative
  fractions (%) of ARPC, MSPC, and NEPC in each sample. Representative images of n
  = 3 technical replicates are shown.'
