caption: 'Effect of tandospirone treatment on the Mecp2-KO phenotype. Both Mecp2 WT
  and Mecp2-KO (Vehicle) mice were treated with saline. Score test (n = 12–15) related
  to general condition (A), hindlimb clasping (B), mobility (C), gait (D), tremor
  (E) and breathing (F). Tandospirone treatment significantly improved the Mecp2-KO
  phenotypes of general condition, hindlimb clasping, gait, tremor and breathing but
  not in mobility. All values are expressed as the means ± SEMs. Statistical analysis
  was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison
  post hoc test for intergroup comparisons. n = 12~15 in each test, * p < 0.05, ***
  p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns: not significant.'
