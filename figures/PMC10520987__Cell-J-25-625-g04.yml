caption: siRNA mediated down-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2 (Nrf2) in NCI-N87 cells. A. The cells were transfected with Nrf2- specific siRNA
  or with control siRNA (C). B. Immunoblotting was used to confirm down-regulation
  of Nrf2 with GAPDH as the control. The results are the average of an independent
  experiment.
