caption: 'DAZAP1 triggers alternative splicing of KITLG mRNA in MM cells. (A) AS events
  were classified into five categories: skipped exon (SE), alternative 5′ splice site
  (A5SS), alternative 3′ splice site (A3SS), mutually exclusive exon (MXE), and retained
  intron (RI). (B) Binding of DAZAP1 was close to the 3′ splice site. (C) The typical
  motif on the peak-bound mRNA regions. (D) Schematic diagrams showed the alternative
  splicing of KITLG. (E and F) Two different probes of KITLG corresponded to different
  patient survivals in TT3 cohort. (G and H) RNA levels of different isoform of KITLG
  were tested by PCR and qPCR assays.'
