caption: Elevation of miR-181a-5p reduced p-ERK, MMP2 and MMP9 in vivo. Nude mice
  were injected subcutaneously with ESCC cells and intratumorally injected with miR-181a-5p;
  (A and B) the protein expression of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, p-P38, MMP2 and MMP9 as evaluated
  by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. *P < 0.05 miR-181a-5p mimics vs. NC group; (C)
  Immunohistochemical staining of MMP9 in miR-181a-5p mimics group and in negative
  control group; the positive expression rate of MMP9 in miR-181a-5p mimics group
  and negative control group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 miR-181a-5p mimics vs. NC group.
