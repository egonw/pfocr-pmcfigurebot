  V. natriegens
caption: 'Locus tags of prominent genes are depicted if redundantly annotated and
  core genes (under the given test conditions) are highlighted in red []. Amino acid
  synthesis pathways are clustered in families and only key branching points are depicted.
  Amino acids are abbreviated with the universal three-letter code. Abbreviations:
  Ac, acetate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; ED, Entnerâ€“Doudoroff pathway; Et, ethanol;
  Glc, glucose; Glcn, gluconate; PHB, polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis pathway; Pyr,
  pyruvate; TCA, tricaboxylic acid cycle.'
