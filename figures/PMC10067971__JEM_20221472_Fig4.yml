caption: 'PHAT gene signature defined using an autochthonous model correlates with
  other phagocytosis-associated macrophage populations and with decreased survival
  in human LUAD. (A) Venn diagram of genes upregulated (fold change > 1.2; FDR < 0.05)
  in PHAT AMs, IMs, and monocytes. (B) DAVID KEGG Pathway analysis of 123 PHAT signature
  genes shared in tdTompos AM, IMs, and monocytes. (C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  of metabolic pathway z-score enrichment above twofold threshold in tdTompos AMs,
  IMs, and monocytes relative to tdTomneg AMs, IMs, and monocytes. (D) DAVID KEGG
  Pathway analysis of 233 PHAT-Macrophage signature genes shared in tdTompos AM and
  IM. (E) Heatmap showing log-normalized RNA-seq expression values of neoplastic cell
  and alveolar macrophage markers for sorted tumor tdTompos AMs, naive tdTomneg AMs,
  tdTompos neoplastic cells, and tdTomneg type II alveolar cells. Log fold-change
  values between phagocytic tdTompos AMs and neoplastic cells were determined using
  DESeq2 and are listed to the left of the heatmap. (F) Violin plots depicting PHAT
  signature score for WT and MerTK−/− (kinase-deficient) efferocytic murine macrophage
  subsets co-cultured with apoptotic cells (). Statistical significance was determined
  by unpaired Wilcoxon test. (G) Left: Jaccard index values measuring marker gene
  overlap between the PHAT-IM signature and adipose stromal murine macrophage subsets
  after classical (Listeria monocytogenes) and type II (Heligmosomoides polygyrus)
  immune challenges (). Right: Jaccard index values measuring marker gene overlap
  between the PHAT signature and murine macrophage subsets integrated across nine
  tissues and multiple inflammatory conditions (). (H) Jaccard index values measuring
  marker gene overlap between the PHAT-IM signature and murine and human adipose tissue
  macrophage subsets (). LAM = lipid-associated macrophage. P values for G and H were
  determined using Fisher’s exact test. (I and J) Kaplan–Meier survival curve of 396
  LUAD patients (I) or 390 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) patients (J),
  stratified by high (>60th percentile) or low (<40th percentile) PHAT signature enrichment
  (TCGA). P values were calculated by Cox regression. HR = hazard ratio. (K) Enrichment
  of PHAT, M1 CIBERSORT, or M2 CIBERSORT signatures in myeloid cells isolated from
  tumor or normal tissue (UCSF Immunoprofiler dataset). One-tailed t test with two-sample
  unequal variance, tumor vs. normal.'
