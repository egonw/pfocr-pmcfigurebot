caption: STAT3, LIFR, STAT5B, MPL, MTOR, MYC, TP53, IL13, PIK3CB, and differential
  expression analysis between the patientâ€™s samples and comparison groups. For each
  gene, multiple swarm plots of log-transformed TPM are displayed. Each plot is a
  combination of one group of samples with one time point sample. The time point sample
  is highlighted with a bigger dot, and its color changes, depending on its z-score
  value (green if |z|>1.96; otherwise, red). The horizontal black lines mark the median.
  Ctrls, healthy donor group (n = 15); Ph+, BCR-ABL1-positive group (n = 31); TN,
  triple-negative group (n = 105).
