caption: Analysis of protein changes in testis and sperm of C11orf94-deficient mice
  by mass spectrometry. a Venn diagram analysis of differential genes between testis
  and sperm. There are 1070 differential genes in testis and 2425 differential genes
  in sperm between C11orf94+/+and C11orf94−/− mice. b Go analysis of differentially
  expressed overlapping proteins in testis and sperm. c-d Analysis of differential
  genes related to Ca.2+signalling pathway (c) and sperm-oocyte fusion (d) in mature
  spermatozoa (n = 3) (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005)
article_title: The vertebrate- and testis- specific transmembrane protein C11ORF94
  plays a critical role in sperm-oocyte membrane binding.
