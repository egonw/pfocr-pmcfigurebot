caption: ERK1/2 activation plays a role in T4-induced accumulation of PD-L1 and β-catenin
  in human oral cancer OEC-M1 cells. Oral cancer OEC-M1 cells were seeded in six-well
  trays and were treated with 10-7 M T4 in the presence or absence of PD98059 (10
  μM) for 24 h. Western blot analyses of β-catenin, PD-L1, pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were
  conducted. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Results are from three independent
  studies (n = 4). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to the control.
