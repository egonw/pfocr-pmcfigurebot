caption: 'NO-stimulated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was Zn2+-dependent.
  Adipocytes were incubated in medium in the presence or absence of TPEN (10 μM) with
  or without NONOate (20 μM) or ZnCl2 (20 μM), and adipocyte differentiation was induced.
  After differentiation, intracellular lipid content was determined by measuring fluorescent
  staining (A,B) and triglycerides (TG) (C). Results shown as mean ± SD for three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared to the untreated group. #p < 0.05 compared
  to matched sets of the TPEN-untreated group.'
