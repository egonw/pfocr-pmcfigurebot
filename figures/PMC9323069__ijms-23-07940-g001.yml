caption: 'Identification and classification of flowering-related genes in G. hirsutum,
  G. barbadense, and G. arboretum. (A) G. hirsutum. (B) G. barbadense. (C) G. arboretum.
  The histogram on the left represents the number of flowering-related genes of each
  flowering-regulated pathway, a single black point in the middle matrix represents
  the number of genes specific to a pathway, the lines between the black points represent
  the intersection of the different pathways, and the vertical blue histogram represents
  the corresponding intersecting gene numbers. Ph: photoperiodism pathway; Au: autonomous
  pathway; Ho: hormone pathway; Ve: vernalization; Ag: aging pathway; Su: sugar signal;
  Fd: flower development and apical meristem response pathway; At: ambient temperature
  pathway.'
