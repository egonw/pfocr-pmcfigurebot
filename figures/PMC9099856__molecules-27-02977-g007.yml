caption: (A) MDMA/hSERT double-bound complexes subjected to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
  in the ‘escitalopram-like’ orientation of the drug. Replica 3 in pink, replica 4
  in blue. MDMA corresponding molecules are in ball and stick representation, MDMA
  at S1 is in translucent blue. The residues proposed to participate in the allosteric
  binding of MDMA are shown. The residues involved in the allosteric modulation of
  the hSERT are black rectangles. Donor-to-acceptor distance as a function of the
  MC energy perturbation steps for the allosterically coupled salt bridges between
  (B) Glu494 and Arg104, and (C) Glu494 and Lys490. (D) Rotated view of (A), in the
  absence of TM segments (ribbons) showing the proposed entry pathway for MDMA from
  S2 to S1.
