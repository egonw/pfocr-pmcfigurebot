caption: 'Importance of PLA2 in metabolism of ARA and production of lipids mediators
  from ARA. ARA C20:4n-6 is cleaved from PC by PLA2. This reaction also produces LPC,
  which can be converted in the intercellular space to LPA by ATX. LPA can be considered
  a lipid mediator because its biological activity is related to the activation of
  its specific receptors: LPAR1-LPAR6. Free ARA C20:4n-6, on the other hand, can be
  used for eicosanoid production in either the COX pathway or the LOX pathway. ↑—higher
  expression of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue; ↓—lower expression
  of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.'
