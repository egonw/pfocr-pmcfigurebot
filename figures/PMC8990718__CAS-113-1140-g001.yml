caption: 'Serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) promotes neutrophil secretion of immunosuppressive
  cytokines through Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2). (A) Protein‐protein interaction network
  relating to SAA1. (B) Representative bands and relative expression levels of SAA1
  in breast cancer cell lines ZR‐75–1, BT‐474, MCF‐7, and MDA‐MB‐231 and nontumorigenic
  cell line MCF‐10 (n = 3). **p < 0.01 vs. MCF‐10 cell line. (C) Representative bands
  and relative expression levels of SAA1, TLR2, and formyl peptide receptor‐like 1
  (FPRL1) proteins in neutrophils isolated from breast cancer patients (BN) and healthy
  controls (HN), cocultured with breast cancer cell supernatant (Sup) or SAA1 (n = 3).
  **p < 0.01 and ##p < 0.01 vs. untreated neutrophils. (D) Interleukin‐10 (IL‐10),
  arginase (Arg), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) secretion by neutrophils
  purified from healthy control and breast cancer patients, preincubated with SAA1
  in the presence or absence of FPRL1‐blocking Ab and TLR2‐blocking Ab (n = 3) **p < 0.01
  vs. untreated neutrophils; ##p < 0.01 vs. SAA1‐treated neutrophils. (E) Immunofluorescence
  images of IL‐10, Arg, and iNOS expression levels in neutrophils treated with PBS,
  SAA1, or SAA1 plus TLR2‐blocking Ab (n = 3). **p < 0.01 and ##p < 0.01 vs. untreated
  neutrophils. Scale bar = 50 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SD'
