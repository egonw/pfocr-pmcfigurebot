caption: 'Evaluation of α-SMA expression in the following conditions: LX2, activated
  LX2 (induced with TGF-β1), activated LX2 + ADSC (activated LX2 cocultured with ADSCs),
  activated LX2 + HGF (activated LX2 treated with HGF), activated LX2 + ADSC + HGF
  (activated LX2 co-cultured with ADSC, treated with HGF). (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of α-SMA (antibody conjugated with AF-488, green), nuclei of the cells
  stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue); (B) quantification of the immunofluorescence
  staining of α-SMA; scale bar: 100 µm.'
