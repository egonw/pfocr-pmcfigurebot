caption: Zinc alters the expression of adipogenic proteins during adipocyte differentiation.
  3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the medium in the presence or absence of ZnCl2.
  Adipocyte differentiation was induced, and the expression of adipogenic proteins
  C/EBPα (A), PPARγ (B), and aP2 (C) was measured by immunoblotting with β-actin as
  the loading control. Those immunoblots are displayed as examples. Results are shown
  as mean ± SD for three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with the vehicle
  control.
