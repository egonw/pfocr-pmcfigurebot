caption: Effects of CEP treatment on GX_P2V-induced aberrant glycosylation of proteins
  in Vero E6 cells. A. Venn diagram shows the effect of CEP on the aberrant glycosylation
  of proteins induced by GX_P2V. The number in purple circle indicates the glycosylation
  sites those are differentially expressed (with Vero_P/Vero Fc ​≥ ​2) in response
  to GX_P2V treatment (GX_P2V). The number in light red circle shows the glycosylation
  sites are in normal state (with Vero_C_P/Vero, 0.667 ​≥ ​Fc ​≤ ​1.5) in presence
  of CEP (CEP ​+ ​GX_P2V). The number in the overlap of the two circle shows that
  there are 13 site (on 10 proteins) out of 81 sites (on 66 proteins) GX_P2V-induced
  aberrant glycosylation sites in normal state in presence of CEP. B. Reactome Pathway
  Analysis of glycosylation sites on 10 glycoproteins affected by CEP. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
