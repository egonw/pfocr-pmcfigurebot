caption: CXCL8 stimulates the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 via the CXCR2-mediated
  NF-κB signaling pathway. (a–c). qRT-PCR (a) and western blotting (b,c) were performed
  to check the expression of ferroptosis-related genes, including SLC7A11, GPX4, HMOX1,
  NRF2, and TFR2, in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells with CXCL8 treatment alone or in combination
  with SB225002 (30 nM, added 2 h before CXCL8 treatment) and in the cells with CXCR2
  knockdown and CXCL8 treatment (50 ng/mL for 12 h). (c) The changes in SLC7A11 and
  GPX4 were quantified based on the integrated density measured by ImageJ (n = 3).
  (d). qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to check CXCR2 expression in PUMC-HUVEC-T1
  cells 48 h after lentivirus-mediated CXCR2 overexpression. (e). Immunofluorescent
  staining was performed to visualize NF-κB p65 distribution in PUMC-HUVEC-T1 cells
  with CXCL8 treatment alone (50 ng/mL for 12 h) or in CXCR2-overexpressed PUMC-HUVEC-T1
  cells with CXCL8 treatment alone (50 ng/mL for 12 h) or in combination with TPCA-1
  (1 μM, added 2 h before CXCL8 treatment). (f–h). Western blotting was performed
  to check the expression of NF-κB p65, p-p65, SLC7A11, and GPX4 in PUMC-HUVEC-T1
  cells as treated in panel e. Quantitation (n = 3, f,g) of protein expression was
  conducted based on integrated density measured by ImageJ. n.s., not significant;
  ***, p < 0.001.
