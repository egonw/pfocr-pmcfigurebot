figure_title: The CCL17/CCL22-CCR4 pathway leads to the activation of ATF6 by inducing
  calcium spherical aggregation in ER
caption: A The bar graph represented the intracellular total calcium concentration
  in DLD1, SW480, and SW620 cells incubated with 20% M2-CM-T or/and CCR4 antagonist.
  B A fluorescence stain was applied to detect the distribution of calcium in ER,
  Fluo-3 AM marked calcium (green), and ER-tracker marked ER (red). C The level of
  GRP78 and ATF6-p50 were detected in DLD1 and SW480 cells treated with 20% TAMs-CM-T
  or/and CCR4 antagonist. D The level of GRP78 and ATF6-p50 were detected in DLD1
  cells treated with 20% TAMs-CM-H or/and CCR4 antagonist. E After knocking down ATF6,
  the expression of GRP78 and the activation of ATF6 were detected in DLD1 and SW480
  with 20% TAMs-CM-T treatment.
