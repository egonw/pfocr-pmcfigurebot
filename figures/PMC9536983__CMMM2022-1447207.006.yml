caption: 'MSC-AS1 sponging miR-429 accelerates NPC progression via the JAK1/STAT3
  pathway. (a) The expression of p-JAK1 and p-STAT3 in NPC and adjacent normal tissues
  were observed by immunohistochemical analysis. Results showed that expression levels
  of p-JAK1 and p-STAT3 were accumulated in tumor tissues. Scale bar = 100 μm (b);
  after being transfected with miR-429 inhibitor, si-MSC-AS1, and si-JAK1, western
  blot analysis was performed to evaluate the changes in p-JAK1 and p-STAT3 expression.
  The expression of p-JAK1 (c) and p-STAT3 (d) significantly declined in si-MSC-AS1 + miRNA-ctrl
  and si-MSC-AS1 + miR-429 inhibitor + si-JAK1 group. NS: no significant difference,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (e) The tumor growth and metastasis-related
  proteins were detected by western blot analysis. (f) The expression of MMP2, MMP9,
  Cyclin D1, and c-myc was significantly reduced in si-MSC-AS1 + miRNA-ctrl and si-MSC-AS1 + miR-429
  inhibitor + si-JAK1 group. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
