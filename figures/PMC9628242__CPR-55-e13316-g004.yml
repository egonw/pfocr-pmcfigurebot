caption: 'tFNAs increased vascularization in diabetic wounds. (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of CD31 and α‐SMA expression of the control and tFNAs groups (white arrow:
  vessel; nucleus: blue; CD31: red; α‐SMA: green). Scale bars are 50 μm. (B) Immunohistochemical
  staining of CD31 expression of the control and tFNAs groups (black arrow: vessel).
  The scale bar is 50 μm. (C) Quantification analysis of the number of CD31‐ and α‐SMA‐positive
  blood vessels between the control and tFNAs groups. (D) Quantification analysis
  of the number of CD31‐positive blood vessels between the control and tFNAs groups.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Significance: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001'
