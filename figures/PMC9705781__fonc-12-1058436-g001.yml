caption: Metabolic profiles in LC patients and controls. (A) OPLS-DA showed that LC
  patients and controls were separated into two distinct clusters. (B) Volcano plot
  of metabolites of LC patients compared to controls. The y-axis represented p-value
  converted to negative log 10 scale and the x-axis represented log2 fold change.
  (C) Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) plot generated from the OPLS-DA analysis
  showed the most discriminative metabolites in descending order of importance. (D)
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of significantly different metabolites showed that
  there were 11 pathways had significant changes.
