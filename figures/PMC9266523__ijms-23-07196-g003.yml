caption: 'Effect of the absence of GCN2 in the response to treatment with APAP for
  18 d. (A) Gcn2 null (Gcn2−/−) or positive mice (Gcn2+/+) were fed the APAP diet
  (APAP) for 18 d or were pair-fed (PF) the Ctrl diet to match the daily food intake
  of the respective APAP-treated mice. (B) Mean daily food intake for 1–18 d. (C)
  Body weight change during the experiment. (D) Plasma concentration of cyst(e)ine
  (reduced form + homodimer + small heterodimers) at 18 d. (E) Plasma transaminase
  activities at 18 d. ALT: alanine aminotransferase AST: aspartate aminotransferase;
  IU: international unit. Each bar shows the median with interquartile and dots are
  individual values. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001; **** p ≤ 0.0001 vs. respective
  PF; Mann Whitney test.'
