caption: The effects of diabetes on the proteogenomic characteristics of PDAC. A Heatmap
  illustrating genomic alternations, biological pathways and protein abundance involved
  in these pathways of patients with and without diabetes. B Boxplots indicating GSVA
  score of insulin signaling pathway (left) and mTOR signaling pathway (right) between
  patients with and without diabetes (Wilcoxon test). C The pie charts indicating
  the percentage of patients with 10q25.3 deletion or MTOR mutations in patients with
  and without diabetes (left). Heatmap illustrates the association among MTOR mutations,
  10q25.3 deletion and diabetes (Fisher’s exact test). D The heatmap indicating the
  cis-effect of AFAP1L2 at chromosome locus 10q25.3 (Spearman’s correlation). E The
  scatter plot depicting the correlation between AFAP1L2 expression and KEGG pathways
  (GSVA score) (Spearman’s correlation). F Spearman-rank correlation of the abundance
  of AFAP1L2 and phosphatidylinositol signaling system (GSVA score). G The scatter
  plot depicting the correlation between abundance of AFAP1L2 and proteins involved
  in phosphatidylinositol signaling system (Spearman’s correlation). H Spearman-rank
  correlation of the abundance of AFAP1L2 and AKT1/2. I Heatmap indicating the impacts
  of AKT1 abundance on proteins involved in mTOR signaling pathway (upper). The lower
  heatmap indicates the impacts of activity of AKT1 on abundance of the phosphosites
  involved in mTOR signaling pathway. J Heatmap indicating the impacts of MTOR mutations
  on MTOR RNA, MTOR protein expression, kinase activity and phosphosites. K Bar plots
  indicating biological pathways downregulated in patients with MTOR mutations on
  proteomic level (left) and phosphoproteomic level (right). L Phosphosubstrates of
  MTOR differentially expressed between MTOR-mutant patients and MTOR wild-type patients.
  Significantly downregulated phosphosubstrates are highlighted in blue, and remaining
  sites are in gray. M The scatter plot depicting the correlation between abundance
  of EIF4EBP1_pT37 and all identified proteins (Spearman’s correlation). Proteins
  involved in mTOR signaling pathway are highlighted in red. N Bubble plots indicating
  biological pathways that EIF4EBP1_pT37 significantly positively correlated proteins
  enriched in. O The pathway (middle) and expression (down) heatmap depicting the
  pathways and pathway related proteins positively correlated with the EIF4EBP1_pT37
  expression (Spearman’s correlation). P Heatmap indicating four mTOR-signaling-pathway-related
  proteins positively correlated with MGPS score (Spearman’s correlation). Q The systematic
  diagram summarizing the impacts of MTOR mutations and 10q25.3 deletion on mTOR signaling
  pathway and cell proliferation. ****p < 1.0E−4, ***p < 1.0E−3, **p < 1.0E−2, *p < 0.05,
