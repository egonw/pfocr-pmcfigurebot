caption: GO and KEGG analysis of predicted targets of five miRNAs. Data show that
  genes were enriched in biological processes of signal transduction. (A); eight known
  canonical cancer-associated pathways were predicted by KEGG. (B), including the
  p53 signaling pathway, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, pathways in cancer, the mTOR
  signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
  focal adhesion, and the ErbB signaling pathway. Networks among specific deregulated
  miRNAs and predicted targets of the classical Wnt signaling pathway. (C) and the
  MAPK signaling pathway (D).
