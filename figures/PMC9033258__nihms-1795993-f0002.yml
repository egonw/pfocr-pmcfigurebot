figure_title: Transcriptome differences between pNS and solid nodules
caption: (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes upregulated (red) and
  downregulated (green) in solid tumors compared with pNS tumors with a ≥2-fold difference
  in expression and an FDR <0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Comparison of 23
  pNS nodules with 21 solid nodules.(B) Some biological pathways enriched among the
  significantly upregulated genes in solid tumors compared with pNS tumors (FDR <0.05).
  Gene Ontology pathway identifiers (GO numbers) are noted.(C) ECM Gene Ontology pathway
  genes upregulated in solid tumors compared with pNS tumors. Average values of the
  scaled FPKM ±SEM for 23 pNS nodules and 21 solid nodules.(D) Type I interferon response
  genes upregulated in solid tumors compared with pNS tumors. Average values of the
  scaled FPKM ±SEM for 23 pNS nodules and 21 solid nodules.
