caption: The expression of MALAT1 increased in hepatocellular carcinoma. (a) According
  to the TCGA database, MALAT1 is upregulated in many types of cancer tissues, including
  hepatocellular carcinoma, compared with normal tissues. (b) MALT1expression in 41
  pairs of HCC tissues and normal tissues was examined by qRT-PCR. (c) The expression
  of MALAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
