caption: 'Inhibition of ASCT2 leads activated HSCs to senescence. (A–D) Quantitation
  of EdU incorporation in indicated cells at indicated treatment (n = 8 per group).
  (E, F) Representative images and the quantification of SA-β-Gal staining in the
  indicated cells at indicated treatment (n = 4 per group). Scale bar: 50 μm. (G)
  The indicated cells with indicated treatment were studied for the indicated proteins
  by Western blot (n = 3 per group). (H) G1 phase to S phase checkpoint protein were
  established by Western blot (n = 3 per group). (I) Cell cycle disruption was analyzed
  by flow cytometry (n = 3 per group). Bars indicate mean ± SEM; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.'
article_title: Inhibition of ASCT2 induces hepatic stellate cell senescence with modified
  proinflammatory secretome through an IL-1α/NF-κB feedback pathway to inhibit liver
