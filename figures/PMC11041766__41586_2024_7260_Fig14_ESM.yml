figure_title: MIRAS patient cerebral cortex proteome and transcriptome
caption: '(a) Proteome profiling of MIRAS patient cerebral cortex. Volcano plot: significance
  (p-value) and fold change. 57 of the proteins with p-value < 0.05 (two-sample Student’s
  T-test) are associated with immune/antiviral pathways (highlighted in blue). N = 3
  patients and 6 controls, all females. (b) Canonical pathway enrichment analysis
  of cerebral cortex proteome in MIRAS (as in a). Ingenuity pathways analyses on proteins
  significantly affected (p-value < 0.05) in MIRAS; pathway p-value (Fisher’s exact
  test) and ratio (number of molecules from the dataset that map to the pathway divided
  by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway). Blue: pathways
  related to immune and/or viral process; orange: pathways related to mitochondrial
  functions. (c) Comparative pathway profiling of cerebral cortex transcriptome of
  patient/control (as in Fig. ) versus TBEV-infected/uninfected wildtype mice (as
  in Fig. ). Biological pathways (analysed using gProfiler server; Fisher’s one-tailed
  test with multiple testing correction using the server default algorithm g:SCS)
  enriched with downregulated genes (p-value < 0.05, fold change > −1.5) in patient/control
  or with upregulated genes (adj-p-value < 0.05, fold change>1.5) in TBEV 4 dpi/uninfected
  wildtype control mice. Left: Top common overlapping pathways of the two datasets
  (pathway adj-p-value < 0.05) are tabulated with the pathway-associated gene count.
  Right: the pathway-associated gene count and adj-p-value. 58 overlapping pathways
  between the two datasets are highlighted in green shade. Selected top pathways related
  to virus and immune response are annotated in blue text to depict the opposed regulation.'
