caption: 'Overexpression of TRIM52 in SW620 suppresses cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion. SW620: untreated SW620 cells. Vector: SW620 cells transfected with
  pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro empty vector as control. TRIM52: cell line transfected
  with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro. *, P<0.1; **, P<0.01; ****, P<0.0001.
  (A) SW620 cells were inoculated in 12-well plates, and after the density reached
  about 60–70%. SW620 cells were transfected by TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro
  and pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro control empty vector, and total cell protein
  was extracted at 48 and 72 h after transfection, and WB assay was performed. TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro
  plasmid was more effective for overexpression of TRIM52 in SW620, and its overexpression
  effect started to show at 24 h after transfection. (B) SW620 cells were spread 20,00
  cells per well in 96-well plates with 6 replicate wells, transfected with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro,
  and the medium was changed after 8 h, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured
  at different time points by CCK-8 cell proliferation assay kit, and the 6 values
  were averaged to plot the curve against the OD value. (C) SW620 cell line was transfected
  with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro and, pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro
  empty vector as a control for 24 h. After digestion and counting, cells were resuspended
  with serum-free culture medium, and each Transwell was added to the upper chamber
  of 50,000 cells, 500 µL of medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber,
  incubated overnight in the incubator, fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystalline
  violet, and observed under the microscope for photographs. (D) Diluted Matrigel
  was added to the bottom of the upper chamber of each Transwell and completely clotted.
  SW620 cell line was transfected with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro and
  pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro empty vector as a control for 24 h. 50,000 cells
  were added to each Transwell upper chamber and 500 µL of medium containing 10% FBS
  was added to the lower chamber, incubated overnight in the incubator, fixed in methanol,
  stained with 0.1% crystalline violet, and observed under the microscope for photographs.
  (E) SW620 cells were transfected with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro, fixed
  overnight in 75% cold ethanol, and flow cytometric detection of fluorescence intensity
  after PI staining. Statistical analysis of data was performed. (F) SW620 cells were
  transfected with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro and control for 24 h, and
  the fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry after collecting the supernatant
  and double staining of all cells with PI/Annexin V-FITC in the appressed wall. Statistical
  analysis of data was performed. CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; WB, Western blot; OD,
  optical density; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PI, propidium iodide.'
