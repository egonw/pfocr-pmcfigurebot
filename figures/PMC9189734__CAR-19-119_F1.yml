caption: EMF pathways of action produced via VGCC activation.There are four pathways
  of action each starting from excessive intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. They are excessive
  calcium signaling and excessive peroxynitrite, reactive free radicals, oxidative
  stress and NF-kappaB/inflammatory cytokines with these two pathways responsible
  for most of the pathophysiological effects. The nitric oxide signaling/Nrf2 pathway
  is responsible for most therapeutic effects. And the nitric oxide binding and inhibiting
  various cytochromes which can contribute to pathophysiological effects as well.
