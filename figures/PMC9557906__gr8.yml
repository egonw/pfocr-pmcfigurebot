caption: 'The MYC/miR-181a-5p/AKT3 pathway in uveitis patients(A) Downregulated miR-181a-5p
  expression was shown in PBMCs from patients with BD (n = 6) () and enucleated globes
  of sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) (n = 4) (). Reprinted by permission from Association

  Research (), Copyright 2018.(B) Upregulated AKT3 expression was shown in PBMCs from
  BD patients by analysis of clinical dataset GSE70403(41 patients with BD and 17
  normal volunteers).(C) Correlation between AKT3 gene expression and Th17 score in
  CD4+ T cells of BD patients was analyzed by the Pearson correlation test. The Th17
  score was calculated based on the average expression level of IL-17, RORC, IL-23R,
  GM-CSF and CCL5 genes (n = 9).(D) Upregulated MYC expression was shown in CD4+ T
  cells of BD patients by analysis of clinical dataset GSE61399 (9 patients with BD
  and 3 healthy controls). The Z score transformed values of the microarray gene expression
  dataset GSE70403 (B) and GSE61399 (C, D). ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01.'
