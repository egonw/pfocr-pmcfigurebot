caption: The cytotoxic effects of anlotinib on Phâˆ’ and Ph+ B-ALL cells. (A) & (B)
  Exposure of either Nalm6 or SupB15 cells to designated concentrations of anlotinib
  for 24 and 48h, cell viability was determined with a CCK-8 kit. (C) & (D) Flow cytometric
  analysis of cell cycle distribution of Nalm6 or SupB15 cells treated with distinct
  concentrations of anlotinib for 24h. (E-F) Annexin V/PI dual-staining assay was
  used to analyze the cell apoptotic proportions of Nalm6 and SupB15 cells treated
  with or without anlotinib for 24 and 48 h. (G-H) Representative flow cytometric
  plots of Nalm6 or SupB15 cells exposed to indicated doses of anlotinib for 24 and
  48h. Each experiment was independently performed three times in triplicate. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
