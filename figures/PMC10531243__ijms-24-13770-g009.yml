caption: The FGFR1/PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in TNBC cells VM capacity. The interaction
  of EA.hy926 cells with two different TNBC cell lines (a) HCC1806 or (b) MBCDF-T
  resulted in VM formation (Control). Incubation of these co-cultures in the presence
  of 5 µM AZD4547 or 6 µM LY294002 for 2 days prevented the formation of tubular-like
  structures. (c) Evaluation of the effect of each compound on VM morphometric parameters.
  The mean number of segments ± SEM is shown in black bars, while the mean number
  of meshes ± SEM is in gray bars. In (a,b), representative amplifications from 4×
  bright field images are shown. Scale bar is 100 μm. Two observers counted the segments
  and meshes per visual field in hot spots of at least three 4× magnification images.
  * p < 0.05 vs. control.

  Microenvironment and Vasculogenic Mimicry Arising from the Interplay between Endothelial
  and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.
