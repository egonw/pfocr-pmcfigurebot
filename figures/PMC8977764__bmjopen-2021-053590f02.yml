caption: Shows stratification of patients on the 2WW breast pathway using the relevant
  algorithm presented in this work, compared with the standard care pathway. given
  an urgent care pathway where the number of referrals exceeds the pathway capacity
  to see patients within 2 weeks, use of the test to stratify patients into risk categories
  (right) leads to a larger proportion of patients with cancer being seen when compared
  with the standard care pathway (left), in which patients are seen on a first-come,
  first-served basis. Patients highlighted in red are identified as being at high-risk
  for cancer (red-flagged), so can be expedited for further diagnostic testing. Patients
  highlighted in green are identified as being at very low risk for cancer (green-flagged),
  allowing for initial management in primary care rather than immediate referral to
  secondary care. The sliders on the left-hand side show the number of referrals,
  the number of patients that the pathway can handle in a given time frame (the pathway
  capacity), the percentage of cancers which are green-flagged (ie, setting a very
  low false negative rate, and therefore, high sensitivity c.f. ), and the percentage
  of cancers that are red-flagged (ie, identifying cases with high risk, so that they
  can be expedited for further diagnostic testing). The red-flagging slider effectively
  sets a sensitivity for the red-flagging process; setting sensitivity=0.9 corresponds
  to the results shown in . The slider for ‘percentage of cancers green-flagged’ can
  be used to set the false negative rate and see the resulting performance of the
  test. collectively, this represents a possible approach to using the algorithms
  to improve the triage of patients referred to a 2WW pathway. An interactive version
  of this is available at https://www.pinpointdatascience.com/patient-test-stratification,
  we note that for the standard care pathway, all non-cancer patients are labelled
  in the same colour (yellow) to indicate that they are unstratified by the test.
  2WW, 2-week wait.
