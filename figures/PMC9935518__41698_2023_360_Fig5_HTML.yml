figure_title: Expression and activation levels of qualifying and exploratory biomarkers
  in the stroma of responders and non-responders
caption: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using Ward’s method displays
  kinases and their substrates in the microdissected stroma surrounding the tumor
  cells collected from 17 of the 20 evaluable patients. RPPA relative intensity values
  are displayed on a scale ranging from red to blue, where red indicates high levels
  and blue indicates low levels of expression/activation. On the x-axis are listed
  proteins measured by RPPA; on the y-axis patients’ outcomes are displayed; samples
  were color-coded based on response rates where blue indicates responders (CR, PR,
  and SD) and red non-responders (PD). Members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  and HER family co-clustering together are highlighted on the x-axis in red and blue,
  respectively.
