caption: 'Inhibition of Gls1 alters multiple signaling pathways in LSCs and synergizes
  with PMF in suppressing LSCs. (A–C) GSEA showed enrichment of gene sets with decreased
  expression including “HALLMARK OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION”, “NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY”,
  “EWSR1 FLI1 FUSION UP” and (D) increased expression for “HOXA9 DN.V1 UP” in GFP+
  LSK cells post BPTES treatment. (E–F) The expression of gene in KEGG pathways were
  enriched and significantly altered (change fold≥2, P < 0.05) post PMF and BPTES
  treatment. The Venn diagrams demonstrate that the expression of gene in the listed
  KEGG pathways were decreased post PMF treatment but were increased post BPTES treatment,
  as well as the expression of genes involved in the listed pathways were decreased
  after BPTES treatment, but increased after PMF treatment. (G) Left panel: the relative
  mRNA level of c-Myc, E2f1, Ezh2, Alox5 and Alox15 in RNA-seq data; Right panel:
  CML mice were induced by BCR-ABL(T315I), on day 14 post BMT, and recipients were
  treated with Placebo or BPTES (10 mg/kg) for 24 h, then LSCs were sorted with FACS
  (n = 3, each group). The mRNA levels of BCR-ABL, c-Myc, E2f1, Ezh2, Alox5 and Alox15
  in LSCs were examined with RT-PCR. (H) LAMA84 cells were cultured in presence of
  the indicated concentration of free PM and BPTES for 24 h, then cells were harvested
  for western blotting analysis with anti BCR-ABL, c-MYC, EZH2, ALOX5, ALOX15, HOXA9,
  HSP90, P21 and P27 antibodies. GAPDH served as the total protein loading control.
  (I) A schematic diagram for the regulatory mechanisms of synergistic effects of
  PM and BPTES. Results were represented with the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001 were considered as significant difference.'
