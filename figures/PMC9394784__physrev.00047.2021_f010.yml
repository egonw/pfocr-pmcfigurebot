caption: Effects of insulin on endothelial cells. In healthy individuals, insulin
  binding to the IR-IGF1-R receptor activates the PI3K-Akt pathway. Phosphorylation
  of eNOS leads to the production of nitric oxide, which stimulates vasodilation.
  With insulin resistance or lack of insulin, there is increased serine phosphorylation
  of IR substrate and metabolic signaling with uninhibited activation of mitogenic
  and growth pathways. Such responses may contribute to attenuated skin blood flow
  responses in those with type 2 diabetes depicted at bottom. eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; IGF1-R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IR, insulin receptor;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B.
