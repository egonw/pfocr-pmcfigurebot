caption: ssGSEA based on KEGG pathways. The table contains the number of times a term
  (on the rows) was found significantly associated with the subtypes comparison for
  each cohort (on the columns) using the subtypes predicted. Each term can be found
  associated up to 16 times considering the predictions executed using the 16 classification
  models. On the left, the vertical color bars show whether a pathway is up-/down-regulated
  and in which subtype. We found decreased metabolic activity in the basal subtype
  with respect to the classical, as shown by the left colorbar indicating down-regulation
  of metabolic pathways in the basal subtype.
