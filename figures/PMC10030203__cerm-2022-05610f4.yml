caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. TLR-2 can form a heterodimer
  with TLR-1 or TLR-6. These complexes can recognize damage-associated molecular patterns,
  which are released through damaged cells. Activation of the TLR pathway leads to
  inflammatory cytokines, which can orchestrate neutrophil activation and NETosis.
