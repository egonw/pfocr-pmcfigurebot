caption: 'The glutamate pathway is altered in the brain tissue of a patient with MELAS.
  Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded human frontal brain tissue labelled
  with GDH (A1,A2), GAD1 (B1,B2), and ABAT (C1,C2) antibodies, from Ctrl individuals
  (left panel) and a patient with MELAS (right panel). Immunohistochemical staining
  intensities of GDH (A2), GAD1 (B2), and ABAT (C2) were examined microscopically
  and scored semi-quantitatively as part of two independent analyses on five Ctrl
  individuals and one patient with MELAS as follows: 0 = absent, + = mild, ++ = moderate,
  and +++ = intense. FL: frontal lobe; LN: lentiform nucleus; T+SN: thalamus + subthalamic
  nucleus, C: cerebellum.'
