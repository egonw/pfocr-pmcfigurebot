caption: 'NMT1 was upregulated in GC cells and modulated GC cell viability. (a) NMT1
  mRNA expression between human GC cell lines (AGS, HGC27, SNU-5, and MKN-45) and
  normal cell line GES-1 was detected through qRT-PCR. GAPDH was the loading control.
  (b) NMT1 protein expression between human GC cell lines (AGS, HGC27, SNU-5, and
  MKN-45) and normal cell line GES-1 was tested by western blot. GAPDH was the loading
  control. (c) NMT1 mRNA expression of AGS cells was detected through qRT-PCR after
  transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid. GAPDH was the loading control. (d)
  NMT1 mRNA expression of SNU-5 cells was detected through qRT-PCR after transfection
  of shNMT1. GAPDH was the loading control. (e) OD value of AGS cells at 24, 48, or
  72 h was assessed by MTT assay after transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid.
  (f) OD value of SNU-5 cells at 24, 48, or 72 h was assessed by MTT assay after transfection
  of shNMT1. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. GES-1 cells;∧p < 0.05, ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. NC group; #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. shNC group. All experiments were repeated independently
  at least three times. Data were performed as the means ± standard deviation. NMT1,
  N-myristoyltransferase 1; GC, gastric cancer; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; shNMT1, short hairpin
  RNA against NMT1; OD, optical density; NC, negative control.'
