caption: C3G activates hepatic autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. (A)
  C3G stimulated AMPK, mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation in the livers of mice in the
  HFD, fenofibrate (FF) and C3G groups. (B,C) LC3-II expression in mouse livers and
  HepG2 cells, respectively. GW7647 is a highly selective PPARα agonist. (D) MDC fluorescence
  staining for autophagy in HepG2 cells treated with tamoxifen and C3G. (E) Analysis
  of hepatic autolysosomes in HepG2 cells treated with STF62247 (a small molecule
  agonist that induces autophagy, and C3G using TEM). For comparisons between two
  groups, Student’s t-test was performed. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005
  compared with controls.
