caption: MiR-30a-centered molecular crosstalk regulates Th17 differentiation in the
  progression of MS and EAE. During the differentiation of na√Øve T cells into Th17
  cells, the TLR4 signaling pathway negatively regulates miR-30a transcription in
  a RelA-dependent manner. In the cytoplasm, miR-30a targets IL-21R mRNA to inhibit
  protein expression. Moreover, miR-30a is recognized by circINPP4B, which serves
  as a sponge to prevent them from binding and suppressing target mRNA
