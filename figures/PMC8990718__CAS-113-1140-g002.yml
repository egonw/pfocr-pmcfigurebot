caption: Serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) is highly expressed in breast cancer (BC) patients
  and is correlated with a high tumor grade and poor prognosis. (A) Volcano map of
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BC and healthy control groups from
  datasets. (B) Heatmap of DEGs between BC and healthy control groups. (C) Main enriched
  Gene Ontology (GO) terms of the genes in functional submodules. (D) Expression levels
  of SAA1 determined in plasma from BC patients and healthy controls by ELISA. (E)
  Representative images of immunohistochemical staining for SAA1 (200×) in BC tissues
  and healthy controls. Scale bar = 50 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01
