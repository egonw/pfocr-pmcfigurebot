caption: 'Effect of MFG-E8 knockout on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the liver of
  NASH mice. The indicated proteins in whole cell lysates, cytoplasmic extraction,
  and nuclear extraction from the liver tissues were detected by Western blotting,
  respectively. Representative Western blotting (a) and quantification (b) of TLR4,
  p-IRAK1, p-p38, p38, p-p65, p65, and GAPDH protein levels in the liver. Representative
  Western blotting (c) and quantification (d) of p-IKKβ, IKKβ, p-IκBα, IκBα, and GAPDH
  in the whole cell lysates, p65, and β-actin in the cytoplasmic extraction, as well
  as p65 and Lamin B1 in the nuclear extraction from liver tissues. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SD, n = 3, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 compared with CD-WT group, ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with MCD-WT group.'
