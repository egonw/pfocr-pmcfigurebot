caption: CD44 plays a role in promoting the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma
  cells through the Wnt signaling pathway. (A) The Wnt signaling pathway was enriched.
  (B) CD44 regulated the expression of Wnt signaling pathway-related proteins. (C)
  XAV-939 reversed the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by CD44. (D) XAV-939
  reversed the proliferative effect of CD44 on osteosarcoma cells. (E) XAV-939 reversed
  the invasive effect of CD44 on osteosarcoma cells. *p < 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
  immune infiltration and affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
