figure_title: Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA reduced the activity of proguanil in
  BC cells
caption: A T24, J82 were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 /well). When the cell
  density reaches 70–80%, cells were treated with 3-MA (5 mM) and proguanil for 12 h.
  Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of LC3 and Beclin-1.
  B T24, J82 were plated on glass disks in 12-well plates (2.0 × 104/well), After
  24 h, cells were treated with 3-MA (5 mM) and proguanil, immunofluorescence was
  used to detect the protein expression of LC3. C Cells were plated in 96-well plates
  (6.0 × 103/well), After 12 h, cells were treated with 3-MA (5 mM) and proguanil,
  the inhibitory effects of proguanil and 3-MA on proliferation were detected by MTT.
  D Cells were plated in 24-well plates (2.0 × 103/well), After 12 h, cells were treated
  with 3-MA (5 mM) and proguanil, the he inhibitory effects of proguanil and 3-MA
  on proliferation were detected by colony formation assay. E The inhibitory effects
  of proguanil and 3-MA on migration were detected by transwell as described in “Materials
  and methods”. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars
  represent means ± SD from triplicate experiments. Vehicle control means the concentration
  of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant).
