figure_title: DMT induces a transcriptomic signature promoting FAO and opposing fibrosis
  in the renal cortex of ZDF and ZDSD rats
caption: 'A-B: Principal component analysis of rlog gene expression counts in the
  ZDF (A) and ZDSD (B) experiments (ZDF: n=6 fa/+, n=6 SHAM, n=9 DMT; ZDSD: n=6 SD,
  n=7 SHAM, n=6 DMT). C: Venn diagram enumeration of the number of DEGs in the ZDF
  and ZDSD experiments, as well as the number of DEGs which were commonly changed
  in the DMT vs SHAM differential expression analysis in both studies. Transcripts
  with an absolute fold-change value ≥1.3 and adjusted p-value <0.05 were considered
  as differentially expressed. D: Dotplot of Reactome pathway over-representation
  analysis illustrating pathways commonly changed in the ZDF and ZDSD experiments,
  for both the SHAM vs Healthy and DMT vs SHAM comparisons [, ]. Pathways pertaining
  to fatty acid metabolism are bolded. E: Network plot of 5 fatty acid metabolism
  pathways changed by DMT in both animal models (bolded in panel D). Smaller gene
  nodes, changed by DMT relative to SHAM in either or both animal models, are connected
  to the larger Reactome pathway nodes to which they belong. Node size of pathways
  is scaled by the number of genes changed in that pathway (lower right legend). Pathway
  and gene nodes are coloured according to whether they are changed in the DMT vs
  SHAM differential expression analysis in one or both animal models. F: Bubble plot
  of predicted upstream regulators of DMT vs SHAM gene expression changes in both
  animal models, identified using IPA software []. Upstream regulator changes are
  presented for the DMT vs SHAM comparison in the ZDF and ZDSD models. The predicted
  status (inhibited or activated) of upstream regulators is plotted according to z-score.
  Dot size is scaled to reflect the statistical significance of z-score changes. Upstream
  regulators commonly changed in both models are bolded. G: qRT-PCR validation of
  expression changes in PPARα-responsive transcripts, both peroxisomal (Acox1, Ehhadh)
  and mitochondrial (Acaa2, Pdk4), in renal cortical tissue from the ZDF and ZDSD
  experiments (ZDF: n=6 fa/+, n=6 SHAM, n=9 DMT; ZDSD: n=6 SD, n=7 SHAM, n=6 DMT).
  Statistical significance of between-group differences derived from multiplicity-corrected
  Wilcoxon rank-sum tests is denoted as follows: ns=not significant; *=p<0.05; **=p<0.01;
  ***=p<0.001; ****=p<0.0001. DEG, differentially expressed gene; DMT, dietary restriction
  plus medical therapy; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; PC, principal component; RQ mRNA,
  relative quantification of messenger ribonucleic acid; VLCFA, very-long-chain fatty
  acid; ZDF, Zucker Diabetic Fatty; ZDSD, Zucker Diabetic Sprague Dawley.'
