caption: ADAR1 deficiency cause DNA damage and ATR/Chk1 activation. (A) The representative
  microphotographs showed immunostaining of γH2AX foci in SKOV3 and A2780 cells with
  or without ADAR1 silence. Scale bar, 50 µm. (B) Quantification analysis of percentage
  of γH2AX foci positive cell in (A). All data were shown as mean ± SD (***, P < 0.001;
  **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05). (C) Protein levels of DNA Damage Response pathway (phosphorylation
  of ATM/Chk1, phosphorylation of ATR/Chk2, phosphorylation of RPA32 and γH2AX) were
  measured in SKOV3 and A2780 cells with or without ADAR1 silence by Western blot.
