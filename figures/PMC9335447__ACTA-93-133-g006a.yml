caption: Ras signalling pathway (A). TGF beta signalling pathway (B). JAK-STAT signalling
  pathway (C). Insulin signalling pathway (D). MiRNAs and their regulated genes (in
  yellow boxes) involved in these signalling cascades are connected by dashed lines.
  The up/down regulation of each miRNA is shown with arrows (orange or blue for CFBE41o-
  or IB3 respectively). Continuous violet lines specify the regulated gene. Graphical
  pathways were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
