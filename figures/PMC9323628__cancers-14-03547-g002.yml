caption: Roles of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in liver cancer. Modulations of the immune
  and inflammatory responses are closely related to the liver cancer. CYLD and OTULIN
  act as the anti-inflammatory factors that are linked to the NFÎºB pathway. Other
  DUBs such as PSMD14, and USP21 could stabilize the MEK2 and thus regulate the cell
  proliferation. On the other hand, DUBs such as CYLD, UCHL1, USP9X, and USP14 could
  regulate the caspase activities. Moreover, PSMD14, USP4, and UCHL5 could target
  on TGFR, PI3K, and PRP19 respectively and influence the metastasis. Detailed mechanisms
  were described in the main text.
