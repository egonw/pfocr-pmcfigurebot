caption: (A) Impact of 1 and JR-9 on the P-IκB and T-IκB pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.
  LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 1 and JR-9 for 2 h in different concentrations.
  The NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway expression proteins were detected using Western
  blotting. (B) Impact of 1 and JR-9 on the NF-κB and MAPK pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.
  LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 1 and JR-9 for 2 h in different concentrations.
  The NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway expression proteins were detected using Western
  blotting.
