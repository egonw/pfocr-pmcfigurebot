caption: 'Overview of the one-carbon metabolic pathways. The one-carbon metabolism
  includes the folate and methionine cycles. Dietary folate gives rise to THF, a one-carbon
  (methyl groups) acceptor. THF accepts one-carbon units from amino acids such as
  serine. The resulting methylated THF provides one-carbon units for important cellular
  functions, such as nucleic acid synthesis and methylation reactions through the
  methionine recycling pathway. Enzymes (in red bold): DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase;
  MTHFD, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; MTRR, methionine synthase reductase; SHMT,
  serine hydroxyl methyltransferase; TYMS, thymidylate synthase; MAT, methionine adenosyl
  transferase; HMTs, histone methyltransferases; DNMTs, DNA methyltransferases; AHCY,
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase; TET, ten-eleven translocation enzymes; KDM1A,
  lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A; CBS, cystathionine beta-synthase; CGL, cystathionine
  gamma-lyase. Metabolites: DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; 10-formylTHF,
  10-formyl tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3-THF,
  5-methyltetrahydrofolate; Met, methionine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  Hcy, homocysteine; dUMP, deoxyuridine monophosphate; dTMP, deoxythymidine monophosphate;
  Cyst, cysteine; GSH, glutathione. Cofactors: B6, vitamin B6; B12, vitamin B12; riboflavin,
  vitamin B2.'
