caption: 'Transcriptional reprogramming of the A549 cell response to N. farcinica.
  a Heatmap of the 48 DEGs of A549 cells at 6 and 3 hpi compared with 1 hpi. No: Unknown
  KEGG pathway. b Venn diagram illustrating the number of DEGs of A549 cells at 6
  and 3 hpi compared with 1 hpi (log2-fold change ≥ 1, adjusted P value ≤ 0.05). The
  number of DEGs was 769 at 6 hpi compared with 1 hpi and 61 at 3 hpi compared with
  1 hpi, and the number of common DEGs in both group was 48. c The protein–protein
  interactions of 48 DEGs were analyzed using Cytoscape software. d The expression
  of ANGPTL4 was upregulated during infection in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, A549
  cells were infected with N. farcinica at a MOI of 10 for 6 h, and the protein was
  analyzed by WB. In vivo, mice were infected intranasally with a dose of 5×106 CFU
  in 50 μl PBS, and the protein in the lung was collected 24 h post-infection and
  analyzed using WB, each protein sample came from a different mouse (n = 5, Student’s
  two-tailed T test, ***p<0.001, error bars represent SD). e Immunofluorescence analysis
  of ANGPTL4 expression in A549 cells at 6 h post-infection. A549 cells were infected
  with N. farcinica at a MOI of 10 for 6 h, and then the expression of ANGPTL4 was
  detected'
