caption: 'IPA® Canonical pathway analysis. (a). Statistically significant enriched
  canonical pathways (Y axis) listed according to their B-H p-values (X axis; −log(B-H
  p-value) = 1.3, orange line). Orange bars: positive z-score; gray bars: no activity
  pattern available. On the right of each bar: number of overlapping DE genes in T
  cells cocultured with sEVs participating in each depicted canonical pathway. (b).
  Qiagen IPA® regulation of actin-based motility by Rho pathway. Experimental upregulated
  (pink) and downregulated (green) DE genes in T cells cocultured with MSC-derived
  sEVs. Predicted upregulated and downregulated by the molecular activity predictor
  are depicted in orange and blue, respectively.'
