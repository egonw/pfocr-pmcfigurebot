caption: Metabolic flux distributions in the CMP in exponentially growing cells cultured
  in the minimal medium containing 10 g l−1 glucose in MGB874 and its PabrB(ΔSA)-introduced
  derivative (OA191). (A) Relative values of the absolute flux values (mmol g−1 DCW
  h−1) of OA191 compared with those of MGB874 are shown beside the flux of the pathway
  indicated by the arrow. Asterisks indicate significant differences because the 95%
  CI does not overlap between the strains. Relative value of malic enzyme (ME) is
  shown as ‘n.d.’ because both flux values are zero. The enzymes catalyzing each reaction
  in the pathways were assigned according to the SubtiWiki database, and the fold
  change (without log2 transformation) in the transcription levels of the genes in
  OA191 compared with those in MGB874 are shown in enclosed boxes. DE genes, as judged
  by a volcano plot in (C), are marked with a dagger (†). (B) Absolute flux values
  (mmol g−1 DCW h−1) in the CMP of MGB874 compared with those of the PabrB(ΔSA) strain
  using scatter plots. (C) Volcano plot analysis of the gene expression levels between
  MGB874 and OA191. Dots for genes involved in glycolysis, PPP, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis,
  and overflow metabolism in the CMP are separately colored as indicated in the inset.
  Genes with log2-fold change ≥ 1 (upregulated) or ≤ 1 (downregulated) and P < 0.05
  were considered to be DE.
