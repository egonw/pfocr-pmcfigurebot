figure_title: NNMT regulates the Warburg effect in iCCA through the EGFR-STAT3 axis
caption: 'A The expression level of EGFR-related signaling proteins in the cells was
  measured using western blotting. B After treatment with 10 μM erlotinib, the levels
  of EGFR, p-EGFR, and p-STAT3 in the cells were determined using western blotting.
  C Colony formation assay using the cell line treated with 5 μM STATTIC. D Migration
  test after treatment of the cell line with 5 μM STATTIC. E Invasion test after treatment
  of the cell line with 5 μM STATTIC. Scale bars: 100 μm. F The effect of NNMT on
  the mRNA levels of the key enzymes involved in glycolysis. G The effect of 5 μM
  STATTIC on the mRNA levels of the key enzymes involved in glycolysis in cell lines
  overexpressing NNMT. H The Seahorse X96 analyzer detects the ability of iCCA cell
  lines to excrete acid and the oxygen consumption rate after treatment with 5 μM
  STATTIC. I Schematic presentation of the pathway by which NNMT facilitated iCCA
  proliferation and metastasis (data are mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  n = 3).'
