caption: 'Schematic representation of the GA-related signaling involved in flowering
  and the development of the flower tissues. Arrows indicate activation and blunt-end
  lines indicate repression or inhibition. Orange box represents the GA flowering
  pathway, the blue box the vernalization flowering pathway, the yellow box the photoperiod
  flowering pathway and green box the aging flowering pathway. Grey boxes represent
  meristem identity genes and floral integrator genes. See text for details and references.
