caption: '10M-D42AN inhibited ATR signaling pathway mediated by DOCK11.A, the amount
  of DOCK11 mRNA in HepG2 cells treated with siRNA targeting DOCK11 and irradiated
  with UV light. Total RNA was extracted and then amplified via RT-PCR with specific
  primers for GAPDH or DOCK11. Data are presented as the mean ± SE pooled from three
  independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; n.s.: not significant. B and C, HepG2 cells
  were transfected with siRNA targeting DOCK11 and EYFP-NLS-Actin (B), or HepG2 cells
  transfected with EYFP-NLS-Actin were treated with 100 nM 10M-D42AN for 24 h (C).
  these cells were then irradiated with UV light, and the whole-cell lysates were
  separated in a 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies
  against Chk1 and pChk1. The band intensity for pChk1 was quantified and normalized
  to that for Chk1. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.005; n.s.: not significant. D and E, immunofluorescence
  staining of HepG2 cells using anti-pChk1 antibody (Alexa488, green) after treatment
  with siRNA targeting DOCK11 (D) or 0 to 100 nM 10M-D42AN for 24 h (E). the samples
  were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The scale bars represent 10 μm. Localization
  of pChk1 in the nucleus was scored for over 100 cells. The ratio under the indicated
  conditions is shown. Error bars represent SE. ∗p < 0.05. NLS, nuclear localization
  signal; SE, standard error.'
