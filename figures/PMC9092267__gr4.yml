caption: 'Interaction of CK2 subunits and kinase activity of mutated beta subunits(A)
  Graph shows interaction of CK2 subunits analyzed by microscale thermophoresis (MST).
  Graph in the left panel shows KD value (12.9 ± 3.9 nM) in wild-type CK2β bound to
  CK2α239Cy5. n = 3. Graph in the right panel shows KD values (15.8 ± 5.3 nM) in mutant
  CK2β (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His) bound to CK2α239Cy5. n = 5.(B) Graph shows the amount
  of phosphorylated substrate peptide in the given time from capillary electrophoresis
  assay. Note that CK2 containing CK2β: NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His shows decreased amount
  of phosphorylated peptide as compared with wild type, whereas CK2 containing NP_001311.3;
  p.Asp32Asn shows no significant differences. The color and shape key denoting all
  the samples given in the figure. n = 3; error bars represent SD.(C) Kinase activity
  of CK2 wild type and mutants based on capillary electrophoresis assay. Bar graph
  shows kinase activity of CK2 containing wild-type and mutant beta subunits (NP_001311.3;
  p.Asp32His and NP_001311.3; p.Asp32Asn). Note that the activity of CK2 containing
  NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His is reduced as compared with wild type, but CK2 containing
  NP_001311.3; p.Asp32Asn variant does not show any significant difference. ∗p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, nsp ˃ 0.05 (Student’s t test). n = 3; error bars represent SD. ns, non-significant.'
