caption: 'Acacetin decreases the expression of Aβ in AD mice. (a) Immunohistochemistry
  for APP/β expression in hippocampus of mice brain 400× (scale bar: 50 µm). The nucleus
  was stained in blue and APP/β was stained in brown. (b) The optical density of APP/β.
  (c) Levels of Aβ-42 were measured by ELISA. Data are presented as mean ± SD. N =
  6 mice in each group. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used.
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
