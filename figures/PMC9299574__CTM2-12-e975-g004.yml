caption: (A) Response of regulatory networks to tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin treatment
  in diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Schematic outline of study design on DLBCL
  patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models under tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin treatments.
  (B) Tumour volume curves of PDX models under tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin treatment
  (left panel, n = 10 each group). *p < .05, **p < .01, ****p < .0001 compared with
  the untreated (green), tucidinostat (blue) or doxorubicin (yellow) group. Tumour
  volume curves of double expressor (DE) subtype (pink, n = 6) and non‐DE subtype
  (blue, n = 4) of PDX models under tucidinostat and doxorubicin combined treatment
  (right panel). ****p < .0001 compared with the untreated group. (C–F) Comparison
  of gene set enrichment analysis between untreated group (n = 19, 9/10 PDXs had replicates)
  and tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin treatment group (n = 10), including NF‐κB signalling
  pathway (C), positive regulation of MAPK cascade (D), WNT signalling pathway (E)
  and NOTCH signalling pathway (F). NES, normalized enrichment score. (G) Comparison
  of gene set enrichment analysis of AP‐1 family transcription factors (TFs) between
  untreated group (n = 19, 9/10 PDXs had replicates) and tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin
  treatment group (n = 10). (H) Gene expression profiling of AP‐1 family TFs‐targeted
  genes upon treatment with tucidinostat and/or doxorubicin. (I) Progression‐free
  survival (PFS) curves of patients treated with CR‐CHOP (n = 31) according to the
  expression of AP‐1 family TFs. (J) PFS curves of patients treated with CR‐CHOP (n = 31)
  according to the expression of AP‐1 family TFs and JDP2
