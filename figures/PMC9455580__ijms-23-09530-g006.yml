caption: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals altered ultrastructure in
  ventricular heart tissue from TMEM43 transgenic lines at 5 months post-fertilization.
  (A) TEM images showing nuclei and mitochondria of the ventricular myocardium. Scale
  bars = 1 µm. (B) Analysis of the nuclear area and (C) circularity demonstrate no
  alterations between the genotypes. (D) Assessment of mitochondrial area uncovers
  significantly reduced mitochondrial size in both TMEM43 variant lines compared to
  TMEM43-WT. (E) Evaluation of mitochondrial circularity revealed altered mitochondrial
  shape in TMEM43-S358L and TMEM43-WT ventricles compared to the non-transgenic control
  (NTG). (F) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  for shared differently expressed genes (DEGs) between “NTG vs. TMEM43-S358L” and
  “NTG vs. TMEM43-P111L” (padj. ≤ 0.05) using ShinyGO v0.76. The x-axis represents
  fold enrichment and y-axis represents enriched KEGG terms. The size of the dots
  represents the number of involved genes. The false discovery rate (FDR) value is
  indicated by colors. (G) Heatmap showing DEGs belonging to the KEGG pathway “Metabolic
  pathways”. (H) Representative TEM images of longitudinal sections of sarcomeres
  showing proper myofibrill organization. Dashed double-headed arrow indicates distance
  between two Z-discs. M, M-line; Z, Z-line. Scale bars = 1 µm. (I) Quantification
  of Z-line distance of sarcomeres represented in (H) reveals a significantly increased
  sarcomere length in both TMEM43 variant lines compared to the TMEM43-WT. NTG displayed
  the highest sarcomere length. (J) TEM images showing desmosomes of the ventricular
  myocardium. Dashed boxes indicate desmosomal junctions. Scale bars = 0.3 µm. (B–E,I,K)
  For all graphs, significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple
  comparison test, * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001. Error
  bars correspond to SEM. n ≥ 3 per genotype.
