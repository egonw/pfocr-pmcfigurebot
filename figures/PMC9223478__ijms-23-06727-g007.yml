caption: A recapitulating scheme of the proposed molecular mechanism of Npy expression
  upon lysine deprivation. Lysine deprivation activates GCN2 signaling by accumulating
  uncharged tRNA. Then, GCN2 signaling phosphorylates the α subunit of eIF2 on serine
  51. Next, the phosphorylated eIF2α restrains translation initiation to lessen global
  protein synthesis, whereas still allowing continued translation of specific transcripts,
  ATF4, that coordinate cellular stress feedback. ATF4, as a master transcription
  factor, induces Npy expression, which further exerts the orexigenic effect to maintain
  energy and metabolism homeostasis.
