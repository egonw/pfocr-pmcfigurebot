caption: 'Structure of complex SARS-CoV NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors: A
  Diagram of the SARS-CoV NSP7, 8, and 12 proteins, including conserved motifs, and
  the protein regions. A. The Metabolism pathway of remdesivir (prodrug) conversion
  into GS-441,524 (metabloite),. B. Structures of ATP, ADP, and AMP-like (size) compounds
  also display. We observe that the structures of AMP (complex of NSP3) and GS-441,524
  monophosphate (complex of NSP12) are highly similar. The size of ADP-ribose (complex
  of NSP3) and the GS-441,524- triphosphate are resembles.'
article_title: Targeting the vital non-structural proteins (NSP12, NSP7, NSP8 and
  NSP3) from SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of RNA polymerase by natural bioactive compound
  naringenin as a promising drug candidate against COVID-19.
