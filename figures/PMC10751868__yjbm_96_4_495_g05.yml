caption: Mechanism of H19 interaction with HNRNPA2B1 involved in CRC metastasis. H19
  interacts with HNRNPA2B1, resulting in the translocation of HNRNPA2B1 from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm. This facilitates the binding between HNRNPA2B1 and RAF-1 mRNA,
  stabilizing the mRNA and consequently leading to the upregulation of RAF-1 that
  activates the ERK signaling pathway. This activation, in turn, promotes the transcription
  of SNAI1, inducing the process of EMT.
