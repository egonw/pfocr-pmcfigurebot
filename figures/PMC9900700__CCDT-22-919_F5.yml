caption: Knockdown of BCL11A suppressed cell metastasis in SK-N-BE(2) and IMR-32.
  (A, B) The ability of cell invasion in controlled and si-BCL11A cells by Transwell
  assay. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs. control. (C, D) Wound healing assay compared
  the migration in controlled and si-BCL11A cells. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 vs. control.
  All experiments were repeated at least three times.
