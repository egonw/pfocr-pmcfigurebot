caption: Metabolic pathways and structure of SAM and SAH. (a) All SAM and SAH derive
  from the methionine cycle, which relies on the availability of the water-soluble
  vitamins B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), B9 (folate), and B12 (cobalamin) that serve as
  enzyme cofactors. The methylation of methionine by methionine adenosyl transferase
  (MAT) produces SAM. In reactions catalysed by methyltransferases, SAM transfers
  methyl groups to a variety of acceptors that include nucleic acids, proteins, and
  neurotransmitter precursors. The demethylation of SAM yields SAH, which undergoes
  reversible conversion to homocysteine by SAH hydrolase (SAHH). Homocysteine can
  undergo remethylation via methionine synthase (MS), an enzyme that utilises both
  B9 (specifically, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, synthesised by 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate
  reductase, MTHFR) and B12 as cofactors, or by entering the transsulfuration pathway
  to produce cystathionine for downstream glutathione biosynthesis in a reaction catalysed
  by B6-dependent cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS). (b) The structure of SAM and SAH.
  The strong electrophilic property of the sulfur-linked methyl group in SAM is exploited
  by methyltransferases to facilitate the methylation of a variety of nucleophile-containing
  substrates, thereby forming SAH as a product. While methyl group transfer is the
  most-studied group donation, SAM is also a source of other groups, such as amino,
  aminoalkyl, and ribosyl moieties [].
