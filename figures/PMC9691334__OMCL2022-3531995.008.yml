caption: 'TF3 increases proteoglycans and Gpx4 expression in a rat OA model. (a) The
  representative Masson staining results of proteoglycans expression in different
  groups are shown. (b) The representative immunohistochemistry staining of Gpx4 are
  shown. Arrowheads indicated positive cells. (c) The number of Gpx4 positive cells
  per field under 100-time magnification is shown. The data are presented as the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments, and statistical significance was determined
  by one-way ANOVA. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. DFO: deferoxamine.'
