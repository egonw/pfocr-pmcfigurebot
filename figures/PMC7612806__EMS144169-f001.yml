figure_title: Simplified schematic of the KYN pathway
caption: The plasma KYN metabolites in this study are indicated by blue boxes. TRP
  is converted to KYN by indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) and in the liver by
  tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). KYN is then converted to HK by kynurenine-3-monooxygenase
  (KMO) or to KA by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT). HK is converted to either HAA
  by kynureninase (KYNU) or to XA by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT). HAA is converted
  to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (ACMS) by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid
  3,4-dioxygenase (3HAO), which is then non-enzymatically converted to QA.
