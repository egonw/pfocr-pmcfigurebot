caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of Longitudinal Cytokine Profiling During Health
  Improvement from Extremely Severe Stage D to A. (A) Top significant canonical pathways
  with an absolute z-score value of 0.8 and B-H p-value ≤ 0.05 are shown. Orange and
  blue bars represent positive or negative z-scores, indicating predicted pathway
  activation or inhibition, respectively. (B) Upstream regulator analysis indicates
  the activation of BCL6 and TP53 at the healthiest time point. (C) IPA diseases and
  function analyses predict the inhibition of mast cells and eosinophils functions.
  Green represents cytokines with reduced plasma levels at the healthiest time points,
  and red indicates increased cytokines. Orange and blue indicate predicted to be
  activated or inhibited, respectively.
