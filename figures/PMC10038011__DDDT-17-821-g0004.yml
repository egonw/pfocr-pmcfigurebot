caption: 'MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T lines in culture were treated with 12.5, 25, 50μM
  ICA or 0.1% DMSO for 24 h. (A and B) The wound healing assay examined the cell migration
  ability. Images were obtained at 0, 12, 24, 36 or 72 h; n = 3. (C and D) The transwell
  assay examined the effects of ICA treatment on MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T cells invasion
  ability; n = 3. Mean ± S.D. Data are representative of 3 independent determinations.
