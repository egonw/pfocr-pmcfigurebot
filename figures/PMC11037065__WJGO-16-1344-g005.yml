caption: 'Chemotaxis and M2-polarization of macrophage induced by MUC13-high tumor
  cells of cholangiocarcinoma. A: Number of signaling pathways among MUC13-high, MUC13-low,
  myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes; B: Uniform manifold
  approximation and projection plot showing the identification of 17 myeloid cell
  sub-clusters; C: PROS signaling pathway activity among the MUC13-high sub-cluster,
  MUC13-low sub-cluster, and myeloid cell sub-clusters; D: Violin plots showing relative
  expression levels of M2-polarized macrophage marker genes, including SLC40A1 and
  CD163, in myeloid cell sub-clusters; E: Violin plots showing relative expression
  levels of CCL2, CCL4, and CXCR12 in tumor cell sub-clusters; F: Immunohistochemistry
  double staining showing the adjacent distribution of MUC13-high cells (MUC13-positive,
  purple) and M2-polarized macrophages (CD163-positive, brown) in cholangiocarcinoma.
  Scale bar, 100 Î¼m.'
