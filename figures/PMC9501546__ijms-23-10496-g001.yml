caption: 'Analysis of TTYH3 mRNA expression pattern and prognosis in bladder cancer.
  (A) Comparison of the expression of TTYH3 in normal and bladder urothelial carcinoma
  (BLCA) tissues using the UALCAN database. Red boxes represent tumor tissues and
  blue boxes represent normal tissues. Red and blue dashed lines represent the average
  expression value of all tumor and normal tissues, respectively. (B) Comparison of
  the expression of TTYH3 in normal and BLCA tissues using the GEPIA2 database. Red
  boxes represent tumor tissues and gray boxes represent normal tissues. (C) Analysis
  of TTYH3 expression levels in bladder cancer versus normal tissues on the Oncomine
  dataset. The threshold was designed using the following specific parameters: p–value
  = 1 × 105 and fold change = 1.5. (D) The graph compares the survival rate of high
  (red) and low (blue) expression of TTYH3 in bladder cancer patients using the PrognoScan
  database. (* p ≤ 0.05, *** p ≤ 0.001).'
