  growth but not morphology
caption: (A) Indicated strains are chromosomal replacements of murA and murD with
  murAP122S, murAL35F and murDD447E, respectively. Overnight cultures were plated
  on LB medium by spot- titering and incubated at 30°C overnight. (B) Overnight cultures
  of the indicated strains were sub cultured 1:100 and grown at 37°C in LB medium
  for 1 hour, then back diluted 1:100 in LB and incubated at 37°C for an additional
  2 hours before imaging (C) MurA as well as the different mutants were purified,
  and their activity was measured in vitro by measuring the inorganic phosphate released
  from the MurA enzymatic reaction. (D) MurC and MurCA132T were purified and their
  enzymatic activity was quantified in vitro by measuring the inorganic phosphate
  released from the MurC enzymatic reaction. (C-D) Statistical significance was determined
  by one-way ANOVA, error bars represent the standard deviation of three replicates
  (raw data points also shown).
