caption: Pathways of glucose metabolism for ATP production and synthesis of biological
  compounds. The glycolytic (oxygen-independent) and mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle (oxygen dependent) pathways contribute to ATP generation for energetic
  support in the brain. Additionally, glucose-6-P can enter into the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) for producing NADPH, regulating redox reaction, and providing a source
  of nucleotides. Glucose can be stored primarily in astrocytes as glycogen in response
  to stress. Additionally, glucose metabolites 3-phosphoglycerate and pyruvate are
  implicated in the synthesis of amino acids, directly or indirectly, via the TCA
  cycle. GA3P contributes to the synthesis of fatty acids and nucleic acids. The H(1–6)
  and C(1–6) atoms in glucose can be traced to different metabolites. C(1–3) atoms
  in glucose enter into pyruvate and C(1–5) and access the PPP pathway. H atoms are
  widely distributed in nucleic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids. HK, hexokinase;
