caption: 'GO term analysis of significant hits (NormZ < −3) in CRISPR‐Cas9 screen
  in Fig , using Reactome pathways from PANTHER16.0.Clonogenic survival of U2OS WT
  and U2OS/SCAI KO cells subjected to indicated doses of MMC for 24 h (mean ± SEM;
  n = 3 independent experiments).As in (B), except that cells were treated with indicated
  doses of cisplatin for 24 h (mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).Scatter
  plot showing cell cycle distribution of cells in Fig . Light grey, G1 phase; dark
  grey, S phase; red: G2/M phase. Proportion of cells in G2/M phase is indicated.U2OS
  WT, U2OS/SCAI KO, and U2OS/SCAI KO/Strep‐HA‐SCAI cells were treated or not with
  MMC (90 nM) for 1 h, fixed 24 h later, and co‐stained with 53BP1 antibody and DAPI.
  53BP1 foci were quantified by QIBC (≥ 3,000 cells analyzed per condition; mean ±
  SD; n = 3 independent experiments; *P < 0.05; two‐tailed paired t‐test).As in (E),
  except that cells were stained with RAD51 antibody (≥ 3,000 cells analyzed per condition;
  mean ± SD; n = 3 independent experiments; *P < 0.05; ns, not significant, two‐tailed
  paired t‐test).Representative images of the experiments in Fig . Scale bar, 10 µm.Representative
  images of the experiments in (E) and (F). Scale bar, 10 µm.Immunoblot analysis of
  FANCD2 siRNA knockdown efficiency in U2OS cells.Clonogenic survival of U2OS and
  U2OS/SCAI KO cells transfected with non‐targeting control (CTRL) or FANCD2 siRNAs
  and subjected to indicated doses of MMC for 24 h (mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent
  experiments).Immunoblot analysis of U2OS WT and U2OS/SCAI KO cells harvested at
  the indicated times after exposure to MMC (0.5 µM).'
