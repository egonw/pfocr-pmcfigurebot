figure_title: Summary of T. pseudonana transcriptional changes in response to C. atlanticus
  filtrate
caption: The green box represents T. pseudonana, the yellow box represents C. atlanticus.
  Upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) T. pseudonana genes involved in cell
  cycle progression, amino acid metabolism, and chitin biosynthesis are shown. Colored
  letters and arrows represent up or downregulated genes, grey arrows represent genes
  that are not differentially expressed. Arrows with dots indicate intermediate steps
  not shown in the pathway. C. atlanticus auxotrophic amino acid residues are derived
  from van Tol et al., 2017 [], and potential interacting metabolites are indicated
  with the curved grey arrows.
