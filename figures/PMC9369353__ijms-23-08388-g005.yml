caption: Phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38, and ERK in rNfCB-stimulated BV-2 microglial
  cells. To analyze phosphorylation levels of MAPKs, BV-2 microglial cells were pre-treated
  with JNK, p38, or ERK inhibitor, followed by treatment with rNfCB (100 µg/mL). Total
  proteins were extracted from the cells, and phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38,
  and ERK were analyzed via immunoblot using a specific antibody for each protein.
  The total JNK, p38, ERK, and β-actin were used as internal controls. Fold-change
  means relative density change compared to negative control without treatment with
  rNfCB and inhibitor.
