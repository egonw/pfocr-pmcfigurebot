caption: 'GRWD1 knockdown suppresses triple negative breast cancer cell proliferation.
  (A) The mRNA expression of GRWD1 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with
  siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B) The proliferation
  of MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was determined by Cell
  Counting Kit-8 assay. (C) The protein expression of proliferation-related proteins
  in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by western
  blot analysis. (D) The proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells transfected
  with siRNA-GRWD1 was also determined by 5-Ethynyl-2''-deoxyuridine staining (magnification,
  x200). *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and
  ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-NC group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing protein
  1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; PCNA, proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen.'
