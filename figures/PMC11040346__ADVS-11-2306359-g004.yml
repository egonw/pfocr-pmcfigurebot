caption: 'JPT2 deficiency inhibits trophoblast functions via the JNK signaling pathway
  and reprograms macrophage polarization, leading to RSA. On the one hand, JPT2 deficiency
  inhibited trophoblast adhesion, migration, and invasion by inhibiting the JNK/ACKR3
  axis. On the other hand, the lack of JPT2 in trophoblasts contributed to M1 macrophage
  polarization by promoting the accumulation of citrate and ROS via inhibition of
  the JNK/IL‐6 axis, which subsequently affected the trophoblast functions. Cs: Citrate
  synthase.'
