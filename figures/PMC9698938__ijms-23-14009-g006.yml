caption: Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 is increased in ConA-treated Dax1 LKO mice liver.
  WT and Dax1 LKO mice were treated with a single administration of ConA (15 mg/kg,
  i.v.) or PBS. The liver samples were isolated at 6 h (WT + PBS; n = 5, LKO + PBS;
  n = 7, ConA; n = 6) post treatment. (a) The protein levels of p-p65, p65, p-p38,
  and p38 were determined using Western blot analysis, and (b) the phosphorylated
  p65 and p38 were quantified and normalized with their respective total p65 and p38
  levels. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Tukey–Kramer test after the one-way
  ANOVA was used to compare the ConA-treated LKO and ConA-treated WT groups; ** p
  < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
