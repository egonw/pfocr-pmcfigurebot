caption: Detection of CuaD and CuaA in R. cellulolyticum derived strains. Membrane
  fractions were isolated from wild-type strain (WT) cells, as well as mutant-strain
  MTLcuaD, MTLcuaD(pSOScuaDSR), and MTLcuaD(pSOScuaSR) cells grown in minimal medium
  supplemented with 0.2% arabinose (A) or 0.2% cellobiose (C). Either 4 or 20 µg was
  loaded on the SDS-PAGE, as indicated on the top of the gel. The (-) sign means that
  no vectors are present. The detection was performed with antibodies probing CuaD
  (left) or CuaA (right). Pure recombinant proteins CuaA (0.3 µg) and CuaD (0.01 µg)
  were loaded as positive controls. Arrows indicate the location of CuaD and CuaA.
