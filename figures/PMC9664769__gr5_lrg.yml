caption: 'Effects of 10 mg/L DDBAC exposure on the expression of genes involved in
  calcium signaling pathways. (A) DDBAC exposure altered the expression of genes involved
  in calcium signaling pathways that variously function in calcium absorption, muscle
  contraction, and neurotransmission. The purple box presents DEGs responsive to 10 mg/L
  DDBAC for 6 or 18 days. The pathway components presented according to resources
  of the KEGG database: specifically, the “calcium signaling pathway” (map04020),
  “endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption” (map04961), “vascular
  smooth muscle contraction” (map04270), “dopaminergic synapse” (map04728), and “dilated
  cardiomyopathy” (map05414). The full names of the components are shown in the abbreviation
  table. (B) Heat map presenting the expression levels (mean) of differentially expressed
  genes involved in calcium-related signaling pathways shown in (A). D6, adult honeybees
  exposed to 10 mg/L DDBAC for 6 days after eclosion; D18, adult honeybees exposed
  to 10 mg/L DDBAC for 18 days after eclosion; CK6, adult honeybees without DDBAC
  exposure and sampled at 6-day after eclosion; CK18, adult honeybee without DDBAC
  exposure and sampled at 18-day after eclosion. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
