caption: Anti‐insulin resistant treatments reduce cancer metabolic rate. A‐B. OCR
  (A) and ECAR (B) were measured in tumor cells treated with metformin and untreated
  controls. Tumor cells were harvested from the untreated MMTV‐ErbB2/Leprdb/db mice
  and seeded into a 96‐well plate for Seahorse analysis. Values are means ± standard
  deviation. OLIGO, oligomycin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide‐p‐trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone;
  ROT/ANTI, rotenone and antimycin A. C. Multiplex analysis for the mTOR/AKT signaling
  pathway in the tumors harvested from untreated MMTV‐Her2/Leprdb/db mice (n = 12,
  control) and those treated with metformin (n = 6) or rosiglitazone (n = 6). Values
  are means ± standard deviation.
