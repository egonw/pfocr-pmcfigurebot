figure_title: CircLIFR is downregulated in HCC and correlates with poor prognosis
caption: A Heatmap of the differentially expressed circular RNAs in five HCC and adjacent
  non-tumor tissues. The red scales denote higher expression levels, while the purple
  scales represent lower expression levels. B qRT-PCR analysis to confirm the resistance
  of circLIFR and linear LIFR, with and without RNase R treatment, in Huh7 and SUN387
  cells. C Actinomycin D treatment to assess the stability of circLIFR and LIFR mRNA
  over time in Huh7 and SUN387 cells. D Results of qRT-PCR to detect the expression
  of circLIFR in 60 pairs of tumor and adjacent tissues from HCC patients. E, F Kaplan–Meier
  analysis showing the correlation of circLIFR expression and overall survival or
  recurrence-free survival in HCC patients. Data represent means ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05.

  miR-624-5p and inactivating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
