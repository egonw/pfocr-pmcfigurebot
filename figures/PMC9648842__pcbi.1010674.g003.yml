caption: 'Time evolution of Î¨rel for each metabolic pathway at different starting
  GLU concentrations for E. coli (A) and S. cerevisiae (C). Time evolution of the
  corresponding contribution of the different metabolic pathways to the growth rate
  for E. coli (B) and S. cerevisiae (D). Metabolic pathways are colour coded as follows:
  GLU fermentative/unbalanced consumption in light blue, ACE consumption in yellow,
  ETH consumption in purple, and GLU oxidative/balanced consumption in green.'
article_title: Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead
  to stability through differential fitness advantages.
