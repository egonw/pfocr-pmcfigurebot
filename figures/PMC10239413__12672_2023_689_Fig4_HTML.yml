caption: 'CircHIPK3 functions by sponging VCP. A KEGG analysis showed that circHIPK3
  was closely related to the PI3K-AKT pathway. B RIP database analysis, autophagy-related
  genes and PI3K-AKT pathway-related genes predicted that they might bind to circHIPK3.
  GO analyzes VCP-related functions. C CHIRP and WB were used to analyze the interaction
  between VCP and circHIPK3 labeled with a probe in T24 and EJ cells. Oligo probe:
  antisense RNA probe, IP: immunoprecipitation. D, E Analyses of agarose gel electrophoresis
  and RT‒PCR confirmed the specificity of the amplification. F RIP and RT‒PCR assays
  were performed using VCP antibody directly to verify direct interaction with circHIPK3.
  G The colocalization of circHIPK3 (red) and VCP (yellow) in EJ cells was detected
  by RNA FISH assay combined with immunofluorescence'
