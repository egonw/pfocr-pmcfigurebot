caption: 'Effects of TG (5, 10 µg) and TG10 + PBA on (A) the caspase-3 and (B) Bax/Bcl2.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 versus the control group. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and
  ### p < 0.001 versus the TG10 group. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (N = 4).
  The representative blots for  and Figure 9A were obtained from the same gel, therefore
  the β-Actin blot represented in these figures is the same. Thapsigargin (TG), 4-Phenylbutyric
  acid (PBA).'
