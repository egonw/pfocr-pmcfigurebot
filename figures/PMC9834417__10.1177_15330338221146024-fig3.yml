caption: Introduction of RhoA mutations activated the ROCK signaling pathway, whereas
  inhibition of the ROCK signaling pathway unexpectedly enhanced cell motility. (A)
  Protein expression of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway in MKN74 cells transduced
  with a vector containing RhoA mutants. Transduction of the RhoA G17E and Y42C mutant-containing
  vector enhanced the expression of ROCK and phosphorylated cofilin proteins (N = 4).
  (B) The ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, suppressed the RhoA G17E-induced phosphorylation
  of cofilin in a concentration-dependent manner (N = 4). (C) Migration and invasion
  assays of MKN74 cells transduced with RhoA WT and the RhoA G17E mutant using a transwell
  system with 10 μM Y-27632 (N = 4). Inhibition of the ROCK signaling pathway unexpectedly
  enhanced cell motility in both RhoA WT- and RhoA G17E-containing cells. (D) Invasion
  assays of MKN74 cells transduced with a RhoA WT- or RhoA G17E mutant-containing
  vector using a Matrigel-coated transwell system with 10 μM Y-27632 (N = 4). Cell
  invasion was promoted significantly in cells with RhoA WT but was not significantly
  changed in cells with the RhoA G17E mutant (N = 4). *P < 0.05.
