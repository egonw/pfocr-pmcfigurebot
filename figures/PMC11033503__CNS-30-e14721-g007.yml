caption: The molecular mechanism of C/EBPβ‐ANP32A‐INHAT/PP2A affecting cognitive function.
  AD‐related stressors increase total C/EBPβ levels and phosphorylated C/EBPβ levels.
  C/EBPβ induces ANP32 overexpression by binding to conserved recognition elements
  in the ANP32A proximal promoter region. ANP32A binds to SET to form an inhibitory
  complex (INHAT) that binds to histones and blocks their acetylation, ultimately
  resulting in reduced expression of life‐related genes. ANP32A, as an endogenous
  PP2A inhibitor, can increase the tau hyperphosphorylation level. AD‐like MAPT/Tau
  accumulation can inhibit autophagosome‐lysosome fusion by regulating the ANP32A‐INHAT‐IST1‐ESCRT‐III
  pathway, and overexpressed Tau can further promote Cebpb gene expression.
