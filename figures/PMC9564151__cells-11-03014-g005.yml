caption: 'HIF1α Signaling Pathways in Fibroblasts from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
  Colored nodes refer to differentially expressed genes found in our dataset IPF fibroblasts
  hypoxia vs. normoxia (green down-regulated; red up-regulated). Uncolored nodes were
  not identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated
  into the computationally generated IPA networks. This figure was created with Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis, Version 2000–2022 QIAGEN. For further information about the symbols,
