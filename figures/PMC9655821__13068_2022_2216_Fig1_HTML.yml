caption: 'Genetic organization of putative gene clusters on an around 56Â kb assembled
  metagenomic DNA fragment. The fragment encodes putative enzymes involved in arabinan
  and arabino-oligosaccharide degradation, substrate binding, transport, regulatory
  proteins and pentose metabolism. Red color: genes encoding putative arabinosyl hydrolases
  including family GH43, GH51, GH127 and GH27. Green color: genes encoding components
  of putative ABC-transporters/MFS transporters. Orange color: genes encoding major
  enzymes of the interconversion and pentose phosphate pathway. Blue background: more
  than 95% nucleotide sequence identity with X. thermophila. Purple background: lower
  than 95% nucleotide sequence identity with X. thermophila. Red background: no significant
  similarity. Schematic organization of four contigs in the box represents the assembled
  DNA fragment composed of contigs 68 (GenBank Accession: OL125336), 57 (GenBank Accession:
  OL125334), 72 (GenBank Accession: OL125337) and 60 (GenBank Accession: OL125335)
  of the shotgun sequencing assembly with around 125 bps overlapping regions in contigs
  57, 72, 60, the presence of contig 68 in the DNA fragment was confirmed by PCR'
