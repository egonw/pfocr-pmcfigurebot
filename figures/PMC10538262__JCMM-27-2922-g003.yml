caption: MTHFD2 enhanced migration and invasion of BC cells (A) Wound healing assay
  was performed to evaluate cell migratory ability for T24 and 5637 cells. (B) Transwell
  cell invasion assay was performed to evaluate cell invasive ability for T24 and
  5637 cells. (C) Representative immunofluorescence images of vimentin staining in
  T24 and 5637 cells. (Scale bar represents 20 μm) (ns vs. Control p ≥ 0.05; ** vs.
  shNC p < 0.01).
