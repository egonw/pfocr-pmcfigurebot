caption: 'ICS II protected against PA-induced lipid accumulation and cytotoxicity
  in HepG2 cells via upregulating PPARα/γ protein expressions and inhibiting NF-κB
  signaling pathway. (a) The safe concentration range of ICS II within 12 h, 24 h,
  48 h, and 72 h (n = 6). (b) Cytotoxicity was determined by the LDH release assay
  (n = 6). (c) Oil red O staining of HepG2 cells (×400, scale bar = 50 μm). (d) Quantitative
  analysis of Oil red O staining in HepG2 cells (n = 5). TG (e) and TC (f) levels
  in HepG2 cells (n = 6). (g) Representative western blot of PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ
  protein expressions. (h) Quantitation of PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ protein expressions
  (n = 5). (i) Representative western blot of IκB-α protein expression, phosphorylation
  of level IKKβ and NF-κB (p65). (j) Quantitation of IκB protein expression, phosphorylation
  level of IKKβ and NF-κB (p65) (n = 5). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. ** p <
  0.01 versus control group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus PA 300 group.'
