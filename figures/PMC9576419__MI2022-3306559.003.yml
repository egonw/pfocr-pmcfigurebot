caption: 'Effects of visfatin on cardiac inflammation in LPS-treated mice. (a) Cardiac
  CD3+ cells and CD68+ cells in the four groups were examined. (b) The expression
  of MCP-1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18 in the heart and serum
  was detected. (c) The activation of the NF-κB p65 pathway was measured. N = 5 −
  6 in each group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the saline + PBS group. #p < 0.05 vs. the LPS + PBS
  group.'
