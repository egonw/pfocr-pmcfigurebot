caption: The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of 11 microRNAs dysregulated in early
  pregnancies destinated to develop GDM. The analysis revealed a total of 62 various
  pathways, where a majority of pathways have been shown to play a role in physiological
  processes and besides to the pathogenesis of cancer. The results were expressed
  as –ln of the p-value (−ln(p-value)).
