caption: Differential expression analysis of samples with high and low H19 expression.
  (a) The volcano plot of DEGs between the H19-high and H19-low groups. (bâ€“e) KEGG/GO
  enrichment analyses performed based on the 596 upregulated DEGs (b) and 173 downregulated
  DEGs (d); MF, BP, CC, and KEGG pathway analyses conducted and the corresponding
  networks based on the KEGG and GO analysis results constructed (c and e). (f) GSEA
  showing different gene expression patterns between the H19-high and H19-low groups.
