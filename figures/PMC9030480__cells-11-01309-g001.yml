caption: Metastatic bone disease and the various treatment strategies employed to
  combat tumor progression corrupt the bone remodeling pathway. Incidence and lesion
  type vary depending on the phenotype of the primary malignancy and can even vary
  amongst subtypes within bone metastases. Treatments can directly target bone matrix
  (irradiation) or indirectly (hormone deprivation, chemotherapy) by interrupting
  pathways critical to maintaining normal bone remodeling and healthy musculoskeletal
  tissue. Systems modeling metastatic bone disease can be achieved by introducing
  murine and human cell lines intravenously, left ventricular intracardiac inoculation,
  intraosseous injection into tibiae or femora, orthotopically or using spontaneous
  models (predominantly canine). Cancer treatment-derived bone loss can be simulated
  by modeling hormone deprivation protocols, introduction of pharmacologic agents
  and under skeletal irradiation. Detection of bone pathology in the laboratory is
  performed using a variety of histological techniques to identify and quantify tumor
  burden, the activity and number of bone remodeling cells and the amount of substrate
  they are acting on and the areal and spatial quantification of bone mineral content.
  Longitudinal in vivo and typically higher-resolution ex vivo imaging techniques
  range in resolution, speed and the detection of metastatic tumor progression and
  treatment response, modalities which are also limited by the animalâ€™s tolerance
  of a multiple round of anesthesia and the severity of the disease progression.
