caption: The molecular mechanisms and modes of the pharmacological action of red ginseng.
  Effects of red ginseng and ginsenosides on key mediators of neuro-endocrine immune
  complex, cardiovascular and detoxifying systems involved in the regulation of adaptive
  stress response to stressors/pathogens in stress and aging-induced diseases and
  disorders. CRH- and ACTH-induced stimulation of GPCR receptors activates the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway in the regulation of energy balance and metabolism
  across multiple systems, including adipose tissue (lipolysis), liver (gluconeogenesis,
  glucose tolerance), pancreases, and gut (insulin exocytosis and sensitivity), etc.
  The key molecules involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTKs). Activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation
  and growth, stimulates cell cycle progression, metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  proteins synthesis, energy storage, angiogenesis, vasodilatation, vascular remodeling,
  cell survival, and inhibits cell apoptosis in response to extracellular signals.
  Nonspecific antiviral action of ginseng is associated with activation of innate
  immunity by upregulation of the expression of the pathogen’s pattern recognition
  receptors, specifically toll-like receptors TLR-mediated signaling pathways. The
  protein kinase C (PKC) family of protein kinase enzymes with 15 isoforms plays an
  essential cell-type-specific role, particularly in the immune system through phosphorylation
  of CARD-CC family proteins and subsequent NF-κB activation. Three stress-activated
  MAPK signaling pathways playing important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation,
  survival, and death have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases,
  including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and cancer. (1) The stress factors
  inducing the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein
  kinase (SAPK) mediated adaptive signaling pathway are heat shock, irradiation, reactive
  oxygen species, cytotoxic drugs, inflammatory cytokines, hormones, growth factors,
  and other stresses. The activation of the JNK/MAPK10 signaling pathway promotes
  cell death and apoptosis via the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes. (2) The activation
  of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is initiated by hormones
  and stresses to trigger endothelial cells proliferation during angiogenesis, T cell
  activation, long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, phosphorylation of the
  transcription factor p53, activation of phospholipase A2 in mast cells, followed
  by activation of biosynthesis leukotrienes and inflammation/allergy, etc. (3) The
  third major stress-activated p38 signaling pathway contributes to control of inflammation,
  the release of cytokines by macrophages and neutrophils, apoptosis, cell differentiation,
  and cell cycle regulation. Activation is shown in red, while the inhibition is in
  blue color cycles/ellipses (effect of ginseng/ginsenosides), arrows, and clouds.
