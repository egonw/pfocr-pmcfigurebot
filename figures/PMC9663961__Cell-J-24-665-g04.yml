caption: 'MiR-18a-5p partially reversed the inhibitory effects of CASC2 on CRC cells.
  A. MiR-18a-5p mimics were transfected into Colo-678 cells and HCT116 cells with
  CASC2 overexpression, and the expression of miR-18a-5p in CRC cells was detected
  by qRT-PCR. B, C. MTT assay and BrdU assay were used to detect the proliferation
  of Colo-678 and HCT116 cells after the transfection (scale bar: 100 μm). D, E. Transwell
  assay was used to detect the migration and invasion of Colo-678 and HCT116 cells
  after the transfection (scale bar: 250 μm). Data are represented as the mean ± SD
  (n=3). The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, CRC; Colorectal
