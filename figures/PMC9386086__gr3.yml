caption: Berberine interacts directly with PKM2(A–D) Effect of berberine on the proliferation
  of HT29 cells after knockdown of metabolic pathway proteins H6PD, PKM2, MBP-1, or
  GAPDH.(E–H) The effect of berberine on the lactate production of HT29 cells after
  knockdown of metabolic pathway proteins H6PD, PKM2, MBP-1, or GAPDH.(I) Thermal
  migration method to detect the interaction of berberine with PKM2 in HT29 cell (n =
  3).(J) Determination of berberine bound with PKM2 of HT29 cells co-incubated with
  vehicle or berberine (5 μM) for 30 min.(K) Co-localization of PKM2 and biotinylated
  berberine was detected by Immunofluorescence after HT29 cells were incubated with
  biotinylated berberine for 30 min. Scale bar, 10 μm. The data are shown as the mean ±
  SD of three independent experiments. Statistics differences were analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
