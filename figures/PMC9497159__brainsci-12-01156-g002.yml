caption: Peripheral blood expression landscapes of adipocytokine pathway-related genes
  and GSEA in patients with epilepsy. (a) GSEA shows that the adipocytokine signaling
  pathway is significantly enriched in epilepsy samples. (b) The expression levels
  of 43 genes in the normal and epilepsy samples and 21 genes were statistically significant.
  (c) The heatmap contains 21 differential expressed genes, of which 3 were down-regulated
  and 18 were up-regulated in epilepsy samples. NES, normalized enrichment score.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
