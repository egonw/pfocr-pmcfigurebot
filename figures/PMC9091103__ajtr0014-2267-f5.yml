caption: ZNRF2 is a direct target of miR-107. A. The predicted binding site of miR-107
  on ZNRF2 sequence. B. Dual-luciferase assay results showed direct binding between
  miR-107 and ZNRF2. C, D. Western blot results showed ZNRF2 is higher expressed in
  MCF-7/TAM than MCF-7. E, F. The expression of ZNRF2 is proportional to TTN-AS1.
  G, H. ZNRF2 is negatively regulated by miR-107. All data are represented as mean
  Â± SD. Each assay was performed in triplicate. ***P < 0.001.
