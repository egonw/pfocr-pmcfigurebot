caption: 'Concerted changes in gene expression in response to hypoxia exposure in
  seal cells. A k-means clustering of gene expression data for seal cells exposed
  to 1% O2 for up to 6 h. B KEGG pathway enrichment for seal clusters. The numbers
  on the right axis correspond to seal cluster numbers. See Additional file : Fig.
  S5 for human cell data. C Diagrammatic pathway of glutathione synthesis. Green italicized
  gene symbols represent genes in seal cluster 3. D GSH content relative to each species’
  baseline. Lettering indicates intraspecific changes among treatments, n = 7–8 per
  group. E Mean intensity of intracellular ThiolTracker Violet fluorescence during
  hypoxia exposure, using n = 4 fields per sample and n = 3 per group. Data are normalized
  to human cell values at each time point. *p < 0.05 between species. F Percent change
  in intracellular succinate concentrations in response to hypoxia exposure, n = 3
  per group. *p < 0.05 versus species baseline'

  system in endothelial cells derived from elephant seals.
