caption: Analysis of DEGs related to p38 MAP kinase. A-D. Boxplots of p38 MAP kinase,
  MAP2K3 and MAPKAPK2 expression in the high and low ICOSL expression groups were
  generated, with the median value determined according to the method mentioned in
  2.1.4 serving as the cutoff value. E-H. Scatter plot of p38 MAP kinase, MAP2K3,
  and MAPKAPK2 expression and ICOSL expression (*P<0.05). I-L. Boxplots of p38 MAP
  kinase expression in the high and low ICOSL expression groups were generated using
  the median value according to TCGA data as the cutoff value. M-P. Scatter plot of
  p38 MAP kinase and ICOSL expression.
