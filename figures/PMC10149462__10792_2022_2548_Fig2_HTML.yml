caption: Morphology and identification of HTFs. a Morphology of HTFs ± TGF-β1 stimulation.
  b Fibroblast marker vimentin was stained but not epithelial cell marker cytokeratin
  in primary HTFs. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI. Scale bar 200 μm. c Representative
  western blot images of α-SMA and snail protein levels in HTFs with or without TGF-β1-stimulaiton,
  which was normalized to GAPDH as the loading control

  and inhibits neovascularization via AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
