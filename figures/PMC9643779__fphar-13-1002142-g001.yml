caption: Sunitinib causes apoptosis in L02 cells. (A) Hepatocyte apoptosis was detected
  by Hoechst 33,342 staining in L02 cells. L02 cells were stained with Hoechst 33,342
  after Sunitinib treatment at various concentration for 48 μh, and nuclear changes
  were observed on fluorescence microscopy (scale bars = 50 μm). Insets white arrows
  denote apoptosis hepatocytes (n = 3). (B) Quantification of apoptotic cells (%).
  ***p < 0.001 vs. Control group.
