caption: CASC11 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer cell tumorigenesis in vivo. (A)
  Following stable transduction of sh-NC, sh-CASC11-1 and sh-CASC11-2 into 22Rv1 cells,
  the cells were then injected into nude mice. (B) Tumor volumes were measured every
  4 days following injection. (C) Tumor weight is presented as the mean ± SD. (D and
  E) Subcutaneous tumor proliferation was inhibited in the sh-CASC11 group, as determined
  by immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67. Scale bars, 100 and 200 µm. **P<0.01 vs.
  sh-NC or as indicated. CASC11, cancer susceptibility candidate 11; H&E, hematoxylin
  and eosin; NC, negative control; sh, short hairpin.
article_title: Long non-coding RNA CASC11 interacts with YBX1 to promote prostate
  cancer progression by suppressing the p53 pathway.
