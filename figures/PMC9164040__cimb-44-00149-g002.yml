caption: The role of the Wnt signaling pathway in OPC proliferation and OL differentiation.
  β-Catenin is the crucial effector in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. When the
  WNT is absent, β-Catenin is phosphorated by GSK3β in the complex, and the phosphorylation
  is the signal for ubiquitination, leading to the digestion of β-Catenin. After WNT
  is activated, β-Catenin in the free state enters the nucleus and promotes OPC proliferation
  via binding with TCF7L2. HDAC may compete with β-Catenin to interact with TCF7L2
  and switches TCF7L2 from an inhibitor to an activator in OL differentiation.
