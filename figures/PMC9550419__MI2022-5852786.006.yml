  at different stages. (a) The signaling pathway analysis of differential proteins
  in C group (middle exudate) compared with that in B group (early exudate). (b) The
  signaling pathway analysis of differential proteins in D group (late exudate) compared
  with that in B group (early exudate). (c) Trend analysis of intergroup signaling
  pathways.
