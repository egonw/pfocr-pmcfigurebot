caption: 'The effects of 4-PBA on CTN-induced oxidative stress in liver. After the
  liver tissue was homogenized, the supernatant was taken to detect CAT (A), SOD (B),
  GSH (C), T-AOC (D), MDA (E), and NO (F); (G) ROS in liver tissue was detected by
  fluorescence microscope (Figure scale bar: 100 μm). The above data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM. Compared with the control group, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05. Compared
  with the Citrinin (5 mg/kg) group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.'
