figure_title: Graphical abstract. Schematic showing that Nrg4 plays a protective role
  in atherosclerosis via ErbB4–Akt–NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: This work describes that BAT-derived Nrg4 serves as a potential cross-talk
  factor between BAT and arteries and attenuates endothelial inflammation or adhesion
  responses, inhibits leukocyte homing and reduces endothelial injury or atherosclerosis
  in a manner involving Akt–NF-κB signaling. Thus, BAT-derived Nrg4 may become a new
  therapeutic drug for atherosclerosis and BAT could serve as a new target for atherosclerosis.
