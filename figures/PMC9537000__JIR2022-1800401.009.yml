caption: Effect of conciliatory anti-allergic decoction-contained serum on the cell
  survival of LPS-induced 16HBE cells. (a, b) The cell viability of 16HBE cells treated
  with LPS or CAD-contained serum was measured by using CCK-8 assays. (c) Cell viability
  of LPS-induced 16HBE cells treated with CAD-contained serum was evaluated by CCK-8
  assay. (d) Representative flow cytometry results showing that the effects of CAD-contained
  serum on cell apoptosis in the LPS-induced 16HBE cells. (e, f, g, h) Western blotting
  was used to detect the expression of the apoptosis-, pyroptosis-, and TLR3/NLRP3/NF-κB/IRF3
  pathway-associated proteins, Bax, Bcl-2, Cleaved caspase-3, NLRP3, ASC, Cleaved
  caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, IL-18, IL-1β, TLR3, p-P65, P65, p-IκBα, IκBα, and IRF3
  in LPS-induced 16HBE cells after treatment of CAD-contained serum. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
