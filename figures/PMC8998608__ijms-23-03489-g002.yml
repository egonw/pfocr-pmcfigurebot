caption: Impact of probiotics on inflammatory and apoptotic pathways and T cell population
  regulation. For each pathway, probiotics that display a regulatory effect are listed
  in the coloured boxes (upper part) and linked with the diseases in which this effect
  was observed (lower part), as evidenced by the circles with the same colour. AT
  = atopic dermatitis; BC = breast cancer; CP = chronic periodontitis; CRC = colorectal
  cancer; EAE = experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; GC = gastric cancer; IBD
  = inflammatory bowel disease; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MG = myasthenia gravis;
  MMP = metalloproteinase; MS = multiple sclerosis; NAFLD = non-alcoholic fatty liver
  disease; ND = neurodegenerative disease; NOD = non-obese diabetic mouse; OA = osteoarthritis;
  OCC = oral cancer cells; OLP = oral lichen planus; OM = oral mucositis; RA = rheumatoid
  arthritis; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; TIMP = tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases.
