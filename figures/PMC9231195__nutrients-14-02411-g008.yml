caption: 'Alisol B regulated RARα-mediated transcriptional cascade and inhibited JNK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway in NASH mice. Hepatic mRNA levels of RARα, HNF4α, and PPARγ were
  examined in (A) DIO+CCl4-induced NASH mice and (B) CDA diet-induced NASH mice. JNK1/2
  and NF-κB phosphorylation were detected in (C) DIO+CCl4-induced NASH mice and (D)
  CDA-diet-induced NASH mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 8. # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 compared with the normal control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared
  with the DIO+CCl4 group or CDA group.'
