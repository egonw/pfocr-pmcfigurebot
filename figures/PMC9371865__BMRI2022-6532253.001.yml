caption: LTBP2 siRNA transfection and validation in GC. (a) LTBP2 siRNA was transfected
  into AGS GC cells. (b) The silencing efficiency of the three sequences was assessed
  by the qRT-PCR. (c, d) The protein levels of LTBP2 were examined by Western blotting.
  (e–h) Gastric cancer cell lines AGS, BGC-823, MKN-28, and MGC-803 were transfected
  with LTBP2 siRNA and cell viabilities were assayed by the CCK-8 assay. Quantitative
  data are presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs.
  the control.
