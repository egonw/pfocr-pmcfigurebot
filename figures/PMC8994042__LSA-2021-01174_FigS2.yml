figure_title: The defect imposed by the 85-90 IFITM3 mutant is also apparent on cellular
  glycoproteins
caption: HEK293T cells were transfected with DNAs coding for the 85-90 IFITM3 mutant
  along with an HA tagged version of CD93. Cells were then fixed and analyzed by confocal
  microscopy. Representative pictures and cumulative analyses of the distributions
  of CD93 in the presence or absence of the IFITM3 mutant (more than 60 cells per
  condition in two independent experiments). P-value < 0.0001 after a two-tailed t
  test between control and 85-90 IFITM3â€“expressing cells. Source data are provided
  in the relevant section.
article_title: A novel domain within the CIL regulates egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
