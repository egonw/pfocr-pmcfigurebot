caption: 'AICAR suppresses EMT and expression of stemness‐related genes. (A) SKOV‐3
  and A2780 cells were treated with 1 mM AICAR for 24 h. Protein expression of pAMPKα,
  AMPKα, pmTOR, mTOR, pp70S6K, p70S6K, NANOG, ZEB1, vimentin, N‐cadherin and α‐actinin
  was analysed by western blot (numbers below each blot are densitometric values).
  (B, C) SKOV‐3 and A2780 cells were treated with 1 mM AICAR for 48 h. Cell migration
  and invasion assays were conducted using a Boyden chamber assay. Upper panel: representative
  image of a Boyden chamber assay. Lower panel: quantitative result of a Boyden chamber
  assay. (D) The effect of AICAR on NANOG, Oct4 and Sox2 mRNA expression level was
  determined by qRT‐PCR. Error bars represent mean ± standard error (S.E) of triplicate
  experiments.'
