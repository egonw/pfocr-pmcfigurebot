caption: SAL ameliorates Aβ-induced neurite and mitochondrial damage. A Schematic
  overview shows the workflow of SH-SY5Y differentiation and primary neuronal culture
  for SAL efficacy study by assessing neurite morphology and mitochondrial dynamics.
  B Immunofluorescence (IF) of neuronal marker Tuj1 (green) in differentiated SH-SY5Y
  cells, treated with indicated Aβ42 oligomers or SAL (see “”). White rectangles indicate
  amplified images at lower panels. Scale bar, 50 μm. C As in B, except primary neurons
  used. D Quantification of neurite length of B and C. The average neurite length
  without additional treatment was regarded as control (CTL). In each condition, at
  least 7 random images (each image includes ≥ 20 cells) from 3 independent experiments
  were used for quantification. E IF of TOM20 shows the mitochondrial segments in
  differentiated neurites of SH-SY5Y cells with indicated treatments. Scale bar, 10 μm.
  The quantification shows the length of mitochondrial (mito.) segments (n ≥ 400)
  in F, and the mitochondrial density indicating by the ratio of mito. length to occupied
  neurite (shaft) length (n ≥ 20) in G. Error bars indicate the mean ± SD from at
  least 20 neurites of 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001;
  one-way ANOVA test
