caption: Identifying transcripts regulated by Ybx-1. (A) Experimental design of ribosomal
  profiling in NRCMs. Ybx1 was knocked down using siRNA, after 48 h NRCMs were treated
  with PE for 24 h and then harvested for ribosomal profiling. Illustration created
  with Biorender.com. (B) Scatterplot representing genes upregulated and downregulated
  due to knockdown of Ybx1 in NRCMs. The knockdown of Ybx1 is highlighted in blue.
  Significant regulated genes are highlighted in red. Full data set can be found in
  Supplementary Table 2. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment of proteins affected by Ybx-1
  knockdown. (D) Cumulative fraction of mRNAs relative to their fold change of Ribo-seq
  (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test p < 0.01) or RNA-seq between all transcripts and Ybx-1
  targets identified by RIP-seq 2 days after TAC surgery. (E) Venn diagram showing
  the overlap of the mRNAs affected by Ybx1 knockdown (Ribo-Seq), upregulated 2 days
  after TAC (Ribo-Seq) and bound to Ybx-1 (RIP-Seq). (F) Heatmap of 7 common targets
  and the difference in expression levels in scrambled and Ybx-1 knockdown. (G) RIP-PCR
  for validation of Eef2 mRNA binding to Ybx-1. Carns was used as a negative control.
  (H) Representative image of a proximity ligation assay (PLA) for Ybx-1 with either
  scrambled or Eef2 modASO (red dots). The sarcomeric actinin is shown in grey and
  the blue highlights the DAPI staining. The scale bar represents 20 µms
