caption: 'Illustration of the immune evasion mechanism by which granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increases programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
  on macrophage through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (JAK-STAT3) signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 upregulation causes
  immune suppression by inhibiting T cell activation in a programmed cell death-1
  (PD-1)-dependent manner. In addition, PD-L1 promotes cancer cell proliferation,
  metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This figure highlights the potential
  therapeutic use of the JAK-STAT3-PD-L1 axis in lung adenocarcinoma. EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition.'
