caption: 'Effect of NLXTD on neurological deficit score and cerebral infarct volume
  in rats after cerebral I/R. (a) The schematic diagram of the experiment. (b) The
  neurological deficit scores in each group after MCAO at 1, 3, and 7 days. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 10); ∗P < 0.05 versus the I/R group; #P < 0.05
  versus the NLXTD group. (c) Representative images of TTC staining sections in rats
  of different groups at 24 hours after MCAO. (d) The quantitative analysis of infarct
  volumes. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05 versus the sham
  group; #P < 0.05 versus the I/R group; &P < 0.05 versus the 2ME2 group.'
