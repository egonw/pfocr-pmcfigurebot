figure_title: Therapeutic potential of targeting the acetylation pathway in cancer
  therapy
caption: A. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACs) plays pivotal roles in suppressing
  cell proliferation and angiogenesis, maintaining genomic stability and metabolic
  homeostasis, promoting immune response and apoptosis. B. Graphic model showing the
  secondary structures and representative small molecular inhibitors targeting the
  BRD and HAT domain of human CBP and p300 proteins, respectively.
