caption: How the fluorescence of the sodium‐sensitive dye Asante NaTrium green inside
  α‐1.wild‐type cells changes in response to nystatin added to the apical membrane
  and the corresponding estimated intracellular sodium concentration. The fluorescence
  of the cells under control conditions is labeled “I.” The peak change in fluorescence
  after the addition of nystatin is labeled “II;” the minimum change above baseline
  after nystatin is labeled “III.” The corresponding intracellular sodium concentration
  on the right ordinate was calculated from changes in the fluorescence of Asante
  NaTrium green on a parallel Transwell plate using non‐linear least squares fit to
  a rectangular hyperbola, B max = 9.1 mM, K d  = 21 mM; y = B max*X/[K d  + X]; n = 3.

  by increasing its phosphorylation at S938 via a PI3K/AKT pathway.
