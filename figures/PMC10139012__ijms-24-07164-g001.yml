caption: 'Effects of 1-Azakenpaullone treatment on the growth of human MSCs and GSK-3
  signaling pathway. (a) Dose–response proliferation curve of human MSCs to different
  doses of 1-Azakenpaullone treatment, as indicated in the graph, versus DMSO-treated
  control cells, as measured by cell viability over 3 days. (b) Representative live/dead
  fluorescence images of 1-Azakenpaullone-treated human MSCs (3.0 µM) versus DMSO-treated
  control cells on day 3 after exposure. Photomicrographs magnification ×20. Cells
  were stained with AO/EtBr to detect apoptotic (cells with green condensed chromatin)
  and necrotic cells (red). (c) Assay for cell viability using Alamar Blue assay in
  1-Azakenpaullone-treated human MSCs (3.0 µM) versus DMSO-treated control cells on
  day 10 post osteoblastic differentiation. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n =
  15); ** p < 0.005; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide.'
