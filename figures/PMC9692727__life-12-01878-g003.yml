caption: Schematic representation of fasting-induced lipolysis model via the cAMP
  pathway. Food deprivation increases cAMP and activates PKA. PKA-C activates the
  adipose triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, which then forms a liquid droplet with lipid
  droplet protein LID-1, which leads to lipid hydrolysis. Adapted with permission
