caption: 'Effects of E. daniellii extract on cutaneous wound healing. Full-thickness
  wound (diameter = 1.0 cm) made on the back of 8-week-old male C3H mice, and vehicle
  (50% [v/v] ethanol, 30% water, and 20% propylene glycol), E. daniellii extract (1,
  5 mg/mL), VPA (500 mM), or EGF (100 μM) were topically applied daily on the wounds
  up to 14 days. (A) Representative gross images of wounds at 14 days and H&E staining
  (lower panel). Arrows indicate wound edges. (B) Relative wound-closure rates were
  quantified as percent wound closure and closure rate of control group were considered
  as 100. Wound sizes were measured every 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14 days after creating
  the wound. (C–F) Wounded tissues excised from C3H mice 14 days postwounding and
  subjected to IHC analyses. (C) Representative images of Masson’s trichrome, picrosirius
  red, and van Gieson staining of wounded tissues (n = 6 mice/group) 14 days after
  wounding are shown (n = 3 independent experiments). (D) Representative images for
  IHC analyses of β-catenin, PCNA, keratin 14, and collagen I at wounds 14 days after
  wounding are shown. Dashed lines demarcate the epidermal–dermal boundary (n = 3
  independent experiments). (E) Mean intensity values for D (n = 3 independent experiments).
  (F) Immunoblotting analysis data for wounded tissue extracts obtained 14 days after
  wounding. Original magnification: (A), ×40; (C,D), ×400. Values are expressed as
  means ± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005, significantly different from
  vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
