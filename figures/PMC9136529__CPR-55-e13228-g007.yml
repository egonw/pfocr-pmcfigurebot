caption: Lithocholic acid (LCA) triggers intestinal injury by inhibiting cell proliferation.
  (A) Changes in body weight of rats in DM, CON‐L and CON‐H groups. (B) Tissue damage
  scoring of rat ileum. (C) The H&E staining (up) and PCNA (brown)(down) immunohistochemistry
  staining of rat ileum (×400). (D) DX‐4000‐FITC levels in the serum of the DM, CON‐L
  and CON‐H groups. (E) Western blot analysis of PCNA and the key proteins in Wnt/β‐catenin
  signalling pathway in rat ileal tissue. *p <0.05; **p <0.01; ***p <0.001; ns, not
  significant. p values were obtained by one‐way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test
article_title: The inhibition of enterocyte proliferation by lithocholic acid exacerbates
  necrotizing enterocolitis through downregulating the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway.
