caption: Differences in the expression of GSL glycans between colon-like and undifferentiated
  CRC cell lines including the relevant genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway.
  The main subgroups of GSL glycans globo-series, gangliosides, and (neo)lacto-series
  are presented in green, purple, and gray rectangles, respectively. GTs that correlated
  positively with corresponding glycosylation features or subgroups of GSL glycome
  are marked in red. TFs upregulated in colon-like cell lines or undifferentiated
  cell lines are indicated in bold blue or bold green, respectively. Underlined TFs
  indicate a significant positive correlation with the expression of certain GTs.
  Dashed green and blue rectangles indicate the high expression of corresponding glycosylation
  feature in undifferentiated cell lines and colon-like cell lines, respectively.
  The display of gangliosides on a white background indicates a similar expression
  for both classifications. Double arrows display that glycans can be further elongated.
  CRC, colorectal cancer; GSL, glycosphingolipid; GT, glycosyltransferase; TF, transcription
  factor.
