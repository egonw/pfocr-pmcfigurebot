caption: Metabolic pathways are upregulated at T2(A) Heatmap showing the mean relative
  expression of genes related to metabolism (GAPDH, ENO1, SUCLA2, FH, ACAA2), to NK
  cell development and maturation (LEF1, ZEB2, FCRL6), cytotoxicity (LGALS1, LGALS3,
  GZMB, TNFSF10, FCGR3A) and genes encoding activating receptors and activation markers
  (CD300C, CD38, CD160) and chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR5, CCR7) at the three-time
  points (T1, T2 and T3). (B) Enrichment dot plot graphs showing upregulated biological
  processes at T2 over T1. KEGG modules database was used for this analysis. Modules
  are ranked based on the gene ratio. The size of the dot represents the number of
  genes upregulated within each category and the color of the dot represents the significance
  of the enrichment.(C) A portion of the KEGG pathway map of the terpenoid backbone
  biosynthesis (hsa00900), showing the mevalonate pathway at T2 over T1. The color
  inside the boxes refers to the Log2FC. The number inside the boxes refers to KEGG
  identification numbers, which represent the gene or gene family found at that position
  in the pathway. Samples from 10 patients with MM, from cohort 1, were used for RNA-seq
  analysis.
