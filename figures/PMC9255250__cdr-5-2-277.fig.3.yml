caption: Origin of lactate production. Normal cells do not use the glycolytic pathway
  beyond pyruvate that goes into the Krebs cycle associated with coenzyme A and converted
  into acetyl-CoA. Malignant cells follow the glycolytic pathway ending in lactate
  that is extruded by the activity of monocarboxylate transporters. Lactate cannot
  stay inside the cell because it would decrease intracellular pH to life-threatening
  levels, thus it must be swiftly exported. This soft-spot of cancer metabolism transforms
  MCTs into valid targets[-].
