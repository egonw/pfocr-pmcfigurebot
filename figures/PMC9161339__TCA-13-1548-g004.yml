caption: 'Cytoplasmic localization and up‐regulation of hsa_Circ_0072088 was identified
  in lung adenocarcinoma cells and tissues. (a) Schematic diagram of circ_0072088
  formation and Sanger sequencing for identifying circ_0072088. (b) Representative
  photographs of RNA fluorescence in site hybridization (FISH) staining for Circ_0072088
  expression (red) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors and their adjacent normal
  tissues (n = 20). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars = 50 μm. Right:
  statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity. *p < 0.05. (c) Distributions of
  the circ_0072088 expression levels were assessed in five various lung cancer cell
  lines (H1299, H1975, H520, H872, 1650). (d) The cytoplasmic localization of circ_0072088
  in H1299 cells was determined by RNA FISH'
