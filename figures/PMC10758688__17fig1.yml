caption: Two-dimensional kinase inhibitor screens in LTED breast cancer cell line
  models. A, Schematic representation of the study. B, 2D screens at 1 μmol/L final
  drug concentration (see Materials and Methods). Sigma plots represent robust Z-score
  rank order, with drugs achieving a robust Z-score ≤ −2 in red. Compounds causing
  ≥ 50% reduction in cell viability were classified as hits. Representative drugs
  of the following classes are highlighted. Green, targeting ER signaling; blue, targeting
  CDKs; gray, targeting PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway. C, 2D screens at 100 nmol/L final drug
  concentration. Compounds causing ≥ 50% reduction in cell viability were classified
  as hits. Venn diagram illustrating the number of hits in common to three or four
  of the cell line groups is indicated. Full list is provided in Supplementary Fig.
