caption: (a) Osteoblast differentiated stroma induces a significant protective effect
  against arsenic trioxide ATO (2 µM) in malignant promyelocytes (NB4) compared to
  undifferentiated stroma (HS-5) and adipocyte differentiated cells (n = 5). Statistical
  significance was calculated by comparing the viability of leukemic cells treated
  with drug alone and leukemic cells co-cultured with different feeder layers, followed
  by comparison with osteoblast differentiated and undifferentiated cells (b) Osteoblasts
  and adipocytes induce a significant protective effect against cytarabine (Ara-C)
  (400 ng/ml) in leukemic cells (U937, THP-1 and Kasumi-1) while adipocytes give marginal
  protection compared to monoculture. Viability was assessed in leukemic cells using
  an Annexin V/7AAD kit by flow cytometry after 48 h of drug treatment (n = 5). (c)
  Evaluation of ROS levels in leukemic cells post 24 h of co-culture with stromal
  cells using DCFDA by flow cytometry. (n = 3). (d) Cell cycle analysis in leukemic
  cells post 24 h of co-culture using propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry
  (n = 6). e) QPCR analysis of NF-κB pathway target genes in leukemic cells post 48 h
  of co-culture with differentiated and undifferentiated stromal cells compared to
  control U937 alone (n = 3). f) QPCR analysis of PI3K-Akt pathway target genes (n = 3).
