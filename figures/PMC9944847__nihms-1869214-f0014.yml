figure_title: rNa-seq analysis of MycΔIE, erT2 mice fed a HFD for 2 weeks
caption: a-j, Mycfl/fl and MycΔIE, ERT2 mice were injected with tamoxifen and fed
  a HFD for 2 weeks. a, Body weight curve. b, Liver weight. c, Serum ALT. d, Serum
  AST. e, Serum triglyceride. f, Serum total cholesterol. g, Hepatic triglyceride.
  h, Hepatic total cholesterol. a-h, n = 7. i, Glucose tolerance test. j, Insulin
  tolerance test. i,j, n = 9 for Mycfl/fl mice and n = 10 for MycΔIE, ERT2 mice. *P
  = 0.0113 (GTT, 30 min), 0.0497 (GTT, 60 min), 0.0103 (ITT, 60 min), 0.0224 (ITT,
  90 min). All data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. of biologically independent samples,
  analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (a-j). The PCA plot (k), volcano plot
  (l) and pathway enrichment (m) of the RNA-seq data from the intestines of Mycfl/fl
  and MycΔIE, ERT2 mice injected with tamoxifen and fed a HFD for 2 weeks.
