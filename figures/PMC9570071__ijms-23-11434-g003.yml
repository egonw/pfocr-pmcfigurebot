caption: Patterns of zebrafish locomotor activities and reactivity to light–dark/vibration
  stimulation. Swimming distance, velocity of 6 dpf zebrafish larvae in open field
  tests (A–E), subjected to light–dark cycles (F–J) and vibration stimulation (as
  indicated by the arrows) (K–O). Panels (A,B,F,G,K,L) were plotted in 5 min/10 s
  time interval, panels (C–E,H–J,M–O) were plotted with average values of the whole-tracking.
  Each test was performed at least three times. The numerical values are presented
  in line charts or boxplots (median and mean, whiskers show 90% confidence levels).
  The results of either nonparametric test or ANOVA followed by multiple comparison
  test are listed in . “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001).
