caption: Comparative synthesis of ketocarotenoids in HEK293T cells transfected with
  different multiple expression plasmids. (A–E) are RP-HPLC chromatograms of ketocarotenoids
  for HEK293T cell extracts transfected with pWZG-A2 + β-carotene, pWZg1R-A2 + β-carotene,
  pPYLG + pWZG-P2A + GGPP, pAPLG + pWZG-P2A + pcrtZ-R + GGPP, and pPYLG + pWZG-P2A
  + pcrtZ-R + GGPP, respectively. Can, Canthaxanthin; Ast, astaxanthin; E, trans geometric
  isomer; and Z, cis geometric isomer. (F) Quantitative analysis of total ketocarotenoids
  (including canthaxanthin or astaxanthin). DW, dry weight. Data were presented as
  means ± SD (three biological replicates).
