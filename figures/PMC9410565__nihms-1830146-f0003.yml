caption: (A) Multivariate spatial analysis showing joint variation in spatial localization
  of the pathways associated with cancer hallmarks in the four samples. The spatial
  principal component analysis (sPCA) plot shows the loading of different pathway
  scores along the first two principal axes. Moranâ€™s I indicate the extent of spatial
  autocorrelation coefficients of the pathways. (B) Representative pathways with high
  loadings are spatially presented for the tumor samples with a correlation plot for
  pathways associated with cancer hallmarks. The intensity of the black color indicates
  proportionally higher pathway-level activity (C) Pathway activity was modeled as
  a function of the estimated abundance of the cell types in the spatial transcriptomic
  data using multivariate regression with a spatial lag to account for spatial autocorrelation.
  Heatmap showing p-value associated with coefficients for the cell types in all pancreatic
  tumor samples. Rho and residual variance values are indicated in

  spatial transcriptomics data.
