caption: Redox protein folding in the ER.A, the redox relay system to remove reducing
  equivalents from substrates may rely on molecular oxygen or alternative substrates
  as electron acceptors. Flavoenzymes such as ERO1 and QSOX transfer electrons from
  reduced disulfides to molecular oxygen with generation of H2O2 as reactive intermediate.
  ERO1 catalytic cycle is coupled to oxidation of PDIA1, whereas QSOX acts independently.
  PRDX4 and GPX7/8 reduce H2O2 to H2O generating oxidized PRDX4 and oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG), respectively. An alternative pathway includes transferring electrons from
  reduced disulfides to vit KO/vit K by the enzyme VKOR. B, redox balance involves
  reduction of GSSG and oxidized PRDX4 by PDIs to regenerate the peroxidase pathway
  (antioxidant recycling) and shuttle of disulfide bonds between PDIA1 and other PDIs
  (PDI equilibrium). C, redox folding involves insertion of disulfide bonds in client
  proteins by PDIs or QSOX followed by sorting and quality control steps. Folded substrates
  are sorted into COPII vesicles for Golgi export while misfolded substrates are directed
  to refolding cycles through interaction with ER chaperones BiP, CNX, CRT, among
  others, and disulfide isomerization. Terminally misfolded polypeptides suffer disulfide
  reduction and deglycosylation by ERMan and EDEM followed by degradation of the unfolded
  substrate by ERAD. BiP, binding-immunoglobulin protein; CNX, calnexin; COPII, coat
