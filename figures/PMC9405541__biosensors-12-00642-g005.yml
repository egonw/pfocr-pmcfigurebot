caption: The light-controlled CRISPR system regulates the metabolic pathway of PHB
  production. The crRNA was expressed on a plasmid and Cascade was activated for expression
  with the constitutive promoter J23119. This Cascade mediates the maturation of crRNA
  and forms a complex with crRNA to target gene sites, thus, disturbing transcription.
