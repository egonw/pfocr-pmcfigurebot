caption: 'SSD dose-dependently inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress
  of SPID rats. (a) The compromised mitochondria were tested by TEM. Scale, 1 μm.
  Yellow arrow: normal mitochondria; green arrow: pyknotic mitochondria; red arrow:
  swollen mitochondria. (b and c) Flow cytometry was used to detect mitochondrial
  membrane potential. (d) The content of ROS in serum samples of rats in each group
  was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The generation of MDA (e)
  GSH-Px (f) and SOD (g) in serum samples was analyzed by corresponding commercial
  kits. SPID: sequela of pelvic inflammatory disease; SSD: Shipi Shugan Decoction;
  FQC: Fuke Qianjin Capsules; TEM: transmission electron microscopy. ∗P < 0.05 (versus
  sham), ∗∗P < 0.01 (versus sham), #P < 0.05 (versus SPID), ##P < 0.01 (versus SPID),
  and ###P < 0.001 (versus SPID). Data represent the mean ± SEM.'
