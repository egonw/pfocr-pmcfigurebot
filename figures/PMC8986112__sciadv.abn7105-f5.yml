figure_title: FGF21 loss in CLPP-deficient mice leads to suppression of different
  constituents of one-carbon metabolism through ERK1/2 pathway and up-regulation of
  genes involved in cardiomyopathy
caption: (A) Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. HSC70 was used
  as a loading control. Experiments were performed on cardiac lysates of WT, FGF21KO,
  CLPPKO, and DKOKO mice at 17 weeks of age (±2) (n = 3). (B) Log2 transcript changes
  in DKOWB hearts compared to CLPPKO, extracted from the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
  data (n = 4). (C) Heatmap of total mRNA fold changes of significantly changed genes
  significantly up-regulated in CLPPKO animals and more than twofold down-regulated
  in DKOWB (n = 4). Transcripts with CARE/AARE motifs in their promoters [as predicted
  by Cytoscape plug-in iRegulon ()] are in bold. (D) Western blot analyses of ATF4
  and p-eIF2α levels in cardiac lysates of mice at 17 weeks of age (±2). HSC70 and
  CANX were used as loading controls (n = 3). (E) mRNA levels (log2 change) of mitoISR
  TFs relative to WT level extracted from RNA-seq data (n = 4). (F) Western blot analyses
  of different proteins involved in 1C metabolism (left) and corresponding quantification
  in cardiac lysates of mice at 17 weeks of age (±2) (right). Antibodies used were
  raised against proteins indicated in panels (n = 3). (E and F) Bars represent means
  ± SD (one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001). (G) Heatmap of total mRNA fold changes representing
  transcripts significantly up-regulated in DKOWB mice but unchanged or down-regulated
  in CLPPKO animals (n = 4). Genes involved in the development of cardiomyopathies
  are in bold.
