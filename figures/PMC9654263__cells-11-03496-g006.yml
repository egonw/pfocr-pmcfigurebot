caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of the cardiac 14−3−3 interactome. All the
  52 proteins were imported into the Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) platform to
  conduct canonical pathways enrichment. Only pathways with −log10(p−value) > 1.3
  (p−value < 0.05) were remained for subsequent analysis. (A) Top 30 canonical pathways
  sorted by −log10(p−value) from all canonical pathways, (B) all metabolic pathways
  and (C) all cardiovascular signaling pathways extracted from all canonical pathways
  were displayed in different colors.
