caption: (A) Tumor sizes in the si-FUZ and NC groups. (B) The mice weight and tumor
  volume curves of the si-FUZ and NC groups. Tumor volumes in the si-FUZ group were
  significantly decreased compared to those in the NC group. (C) Representative micro-PET
  images of mice in the si-FUZ and NC groups. (D) 18F-FDG SUVmax values in the si-FUZ
  group were significantly decreased compared to those in the NC group. (E) Representative
  IHC images of KI67, FUZ, GLUT1, LDHA, AKT, and p-AKT staining in A549 xenografts.
  si-FUZ is FUZ siRNA and NC is negative control. Measurements were taken from three
  independent experiments. ***P < 0.001.
