caption: Effects of presence of WT-TP53 on glycolysis. Glycolysis for STAT, glycolytic
  capacity, and glycolytic reserve for STAT were measured by the Seahorse instrument.
  The data for MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN is the same control as presented in []. Both MIA-PaCa-2
  + MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 were examined the same time on the Seahorse machine. STAT
  is an abbreviation for statistics used in study which was the Mannâ€“Whitney test.
article_title: Wild type and gain of function mutant TP53 can regulate the sensitivity
  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
