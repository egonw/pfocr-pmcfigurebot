caption: 'Mitochondrial fusion modulates ATM-dependent DNA damage response signaling.
  (A) U2OS cells were treated with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 25 μM or 50 μM) in the
  presence of Phleo for 2 h, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.
  The p-ATM level was quantified by using imageJ. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired
  Student''s t-test. (B) U2OS cells were transfected with control or MFN1 siRNA and
  harvested after treatment with Phleo for 2 h. Cells were immunoblotted with indicated
  antibodies and the phospho-ATM levels were quantified from western blot images.
  Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus
  control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student''s t-test. (C) U2OS cells were transfected
  with Myc-hFis1 and treated with H2O2 for 20 min. Cells were immunoblotted with indicated
  antibodies. Expression levels of the p-ATM were measured from western blot images.
  Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus
  control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student''s t-test. (D) Cells stably expressing
  the MFN1 shRNA were treated with Phleo for 2 hr and subjected to immunostaining.
  Images were obtained from representative cells: p-ATM (green), MitoTracker (red)
  and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). Cells were counted in three independent
  experiments; nshCtrl= 242, nshMFN1= 289 cells. scale bars, 10 μm. (E) MFN1-depleted
  U2OS cells were treated with Phleo for 2 h and subjected to immunostaining. Cells
  were analysed by immunofluorescence staining: MDC1 (green), MitoTracker (red) or
  DAPI (blue). Lower panels show the percentage of cells with >10 p-ATM foci per cell,
  or cells of >10 MDC1 foci per cell in three independent experiments; nshCtrl= 262,
  nshMFN1= 324 cells. scale bars, 10 μm. (F) U2OS cells transfected with FLAG-ATM
  vector and harvested after treatment with Phleo for 2 h. Cells were immunoprecipitated
  with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunobltted with the p-JNK antibodies. (G) Endogenous
  JNK were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody, followed by immunoblotting with
  p-ATM antibodies. (H) Cells stably expressing MFN1 shRNA were treated with Phleo
  for 2 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody and immunoblotted
  with anti-p-ATM antibodies. (I) U2OS cells stably expressing the MFN1 shRNA were
  treated with H2O2 for 20 min, followed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-p-JNK
  (green), p-ATM (red) and DAPI (blue). The graphs represent mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments showing relative signal intensity of p-JNK or p-ATM (siCtrl
  n = 33 and siMFN1 n = 35) at the nucleus. *** P < 0.001 versus control siRNA by
  two-sided unpaired Student''s t-test.'
