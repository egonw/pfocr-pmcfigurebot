caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the potential role of exogenous UB in ischemic
  heart disease (β-AR-stimulated and post-I/R injury). In cardiac myocytes, β-AR stimulation
  acting via adenylyl cyclase-dependent pathway increases extracellular levels of
  UB. UB/CXCR4 interaction may inhibit mitochondrial death pathway via the activation
  of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, and influence fibroblast phenotype and function (fibrosis)
  and vascular remodeling. Exogenous UB may also influence the infarct healing process
  by decreasing the inflammatory response in the heart following myocardial I/R injury.
  Apoptotic pathway is represented by red color, while UB-mediated protective signaling
  pathways are represented by green color. ISO, isoproterenol; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase.
