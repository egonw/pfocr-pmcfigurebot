caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress was increased significantly. A Transcription
  levels of multiple genes involved in disulfide bond formation. B Transcription levels
  of genes involved in transportation across the ER membrane and the ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins. C Transcription levels of ER stress
  marker genes. D Transcription levels of molecular chaperones that assist in protein
  folding. E UMAP plot depicting the single-cell activity of the “unfolded protein
  binding” pathway with the GSVA score. F UMAP plot depicting the single-cell activity
  of the “misfolded protein binding” pathway with the GSVA score. G Role of the unfolded
  protein response (UPR) in alleviating ERS
