caption: LiCl activated Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and M2 polarization in vitro. (A)
  RT‐qPCR analysis showed that the increasing concentrations of LiCl led to significantly
  reduced M1 marker expressions and increased M2 marker expressions dose‐dependently.
  (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a LiCl‐induced Wnt/β‐catenin signaling activation
  along with a down‐regulation of the M1 (iNOS) and an upregulation of the M2 (Arginase)
  marker. The protein levels of β‐catenin were also significantly increased after
  the LiCl treatment. Asterisk indicates significant difference (*p < .05; ***p < .001)

  of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
