caption: MICAL1 was overexpressed in PC tissues and cells. A MICAL1 mRNA expression
  in 179 PC tissues and 171 normal pancreatic tissues based on GTEx and TCGA databases.
  B MICAL1 mRNA expression in 39 normal pancreatic tissues and 39 PC tissues based
  on GSE15471. C MICAL1 mRNA expression in 45 normal pancreatic tissues and 45 PC
  tissues based on GSE28735 datasets. D, E RT-qPCR (D) and IHC (E) detected the expression
  of MICAL1 in 92 PC tissues and adjacent tissues. Scale bar, 100 μm. F Kaplan–Meier
  plots representing probabilities of overall survival in 92 PC patients according
  to the median histochemical score. Statistical analysis was conducted using the
  log-rank test. G, H MICAL1 mRNA (G) and protein (H) expressions in HPNE cells and
  described PC cells were tested. Except for F, statistical analysis was conducted
  using the two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01

  invasion by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway.
