caption: Molecular pathogenesis of ribosomopathies and their potential inflammatory
  consequences. The failure of mutant ribosomal proteins of the small 40S (RPS) and/or
  large 60S (RPL) ribosomal subunits to assemble into ribosomes induces the nucleolar
  stress response leading to p53 stabilization via persistent inactivation of the
  MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This, in turn, results in genome instability and subsequent
  leakage of double-stranded (ds)DNA into the cytosol. Cytoplasmic dsDNA is then sensed
  by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which promotes a type I IFN response via the
  STING/IRF3 signaling pathway, as indicated. The recruitment of cGAS in the cytosol
  is itself facilitated by defective and collided ribosomes.
