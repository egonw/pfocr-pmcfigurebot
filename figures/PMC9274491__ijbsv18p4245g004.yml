caption: RASAL2 regulated the Hippo/YAP signaling. a Gene set enrichment analysis
  of Hippo pathway in PANC-1 cells with RASAL2 knockdown. b Western blot analysis
  showing the p-YAP1 (s127) and YAP1 expression after altered RASAL2 expression in
  PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells (N = 3). c The subcellular distribution of YAP1 was
  shown by immunofluorescence. The staining of YAP1 was green in PANC-1 cells with
  RASAL2 silencing and it was red in MIA PaCa-2 cells overexpressing RASAL2. Nuclei
  were shown as blue (N = 3). d The subcellular distributions of YAP1 in PANC-1 cells
  with RASAL2 knockdown and in MIA PaCa-2 cells overexpressing RASAL2 were determined
  by western blot analyses using the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (N = 3). 18S
  was used as the endogenous control for quantitative real-time RT-PCR, GAPDH and
  Lamin B1 were used as a loading control for western blotting assays. The scale bar
  is 20 Âµm.
