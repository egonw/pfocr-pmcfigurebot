figure_title: Pathway analysis of serum factors identified in samples derived from
  responders and non-responders (see Fig. )
caption: A 3 days post-vaccination and B 7 days post-vaccination (Pathview online
  tool). Input data = log2 values of day X/day 0. Orange indicates factors showing
  a higher response in responders, blue indicates factors showing a higher response
  in non-responders (day 3 p = 0.96, day 7 p = 0.99). P value calculated by GAGE.
