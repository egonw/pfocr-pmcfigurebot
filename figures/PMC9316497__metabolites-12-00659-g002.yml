caption: LCA alleviates the dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis induced by DON.
  The genes involved in the cholesterol homeostasis pathway and cholesterol efflux
  pathway were the most abundant using GO analysis. (A) DON versus vehicle; (B) DON
  + LCA10 versus DON; (C) DON + LCA20 versus DON. Red and blue represent the upregulated
  or downregulated signaling pathways when comparing DON versus vehicle, DON + LCA10
  versus DON, or DON + LCA20 versus DON, respectively.
