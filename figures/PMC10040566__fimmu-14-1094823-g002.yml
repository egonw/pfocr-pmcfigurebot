caption: An overview of the IL-17A/MAPK signaling pathway in the proliferation of
  breast cancer. ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK are the major effector molecules of this
  signal cascade and lead to phosphorylate multiple transcription factors, particularly
  activator protein one (AP-1), which is a hetero-dimeric composition of c-Jun and
  c-Fos proteins. Once active, it translocates to the nucleus and orchestrates the
  expression and function of many proliferative genes or cell cycle regulators such
  as cyclin D1 (G1-to-S phase) and cyclin A/E (S-to-G2 phase). In turn, it increases
  cell growth or proliferation and survival.
