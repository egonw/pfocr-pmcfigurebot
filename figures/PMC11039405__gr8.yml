caption: A diagram showing the proposed regulatory pathways that connect P. aeruginosa
  T3SS gene expression to the extracellular signal Ca2+FleR negatively regulates T3SS
  gene expression by repressing the master T3SS activator ExsA under Ca2+-rich conditions.
  When FleR is normally expressed, it reduces T3SS gene expression and virulence of
  P. aeruginosa mainly through the c-di-GMP/FleQ and Gac/Rsm pathways, which is independent
  of its DNA-binding motif. AmrZ, a transcription factor belonging to the FleR regulon,
  inhibits T3SS gene expression by directly targeting the promoter of exsCEBA in an
  expression level-dependent manner. The pink arrows indicate activation or positive
  regulation, whereas green T-shaped symbols indicate inactivation or negative regulation.
