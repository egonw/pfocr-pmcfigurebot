caption: 'miR-26a-5p targets DNMT3A to reduce global DNA methylation and restore SFRP1
  expression. (a)–(d) Protein levels of DNMT3A and SFRP1 were determined by western
  blotting after miR-26a-5p upregulation, DNMT3A inhibition, and 5-Azadc stimulation.
  (b) Global DNA methylation was detected by ELISA after miR-26a-5p upregulation,
  DNMT3A inhibition, and 5-Azadc stimulation. (c) DNA methylation levels of SFRP1
  promoter were analyzed by MSP-PCR after miR-26a-5p upregulation, DNMT3A inhibition,
  and 5-Azadc stimulation. Marker: 1000 bp DNA size marker. Control group was used
  as the blank control. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
