caption: Identification and viability testing of LF cells. Immunofluorescence staining
  of collagen I (A) and vimentin (B). Ligamentum flavum cells cultured with different
  concentrations of exogenous EGF were quantitatively analyzed by MTT method, and
  there was no significant change in cell viability (C, P=0.46). Immunofluorescence
  is shown using FITC (green) and nuclei is shown using DAPI (blue), scale bar indicates
  50 μm.
