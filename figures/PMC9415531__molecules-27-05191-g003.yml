caption: Mitochondria-dependent pathway mediates ISO-induced apoptosis of GC cells.
  Cells were treated with 20 μM ISO. (A,B) Representative images of two types of GC
  cells stained by Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos with the indicated ISO treatments. (C,D)
  Statistics of fluorescence intensity of Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos signals shown in
  (A,B). (E–H) MMP detected by JC-1 staining assays and ROS in two types of GC cells
  with the indicated ISO treatments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; compared to control
  (n = 3) by unpaired Student’s t test. (I,J) Expression of mitochondria-associated
  Bax, mitochondria-associated Bcl-2, COX IV, cytoplasmic cytochrome-c, and β-actin
  in AGS-1 (I) and HGC-27 (J) cells revealed by Western blotting. Bax, Bcl-2, and
  COX IV were detected with the mitochondrial fraction, while the others were detected
  with the total cell lysates. COX IV and β-actin were used as a loading control for
  mitochondria and total cell lysates, respectively. (K,L) Statistics of the relative
  ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and expression level of cytochrome-c shown in (I,J). (M) Knockdown
  of Bax by shRNA in AGS-1 and HGC-27 cells, shown by RT–qPCR. *** p < 0.001 compared
  to Scr. (n = 3) are calculated using unpaired Student’s t test. (N) CCK-8 assays
  of Bax knockdown cells with 20 μM ISO treatment. *** p < 0.001 compared to Scr.
  calculated using unpaired Student’s t test (n = 3).
