caption: Bone microenvironment factors regulate prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs)
  during both processes of prostate cancer bone metastasis and drug resistance. When
  the PCSCs occupy the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) niche, the PCSCs interact with
  bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblast, BMSCs influence the PCSCs via
  SHH signaling pathway, osteoblast influence the PCSCs via Notch and Wnt signaling
  pathway. The endothelial in the bone marrow microenvironment can secrete CXCL12
  to induce PCSCs migration and colonization at the metastatic niche. Cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) can maintain the stemness of PCSCs through MMP secretion and
  pro-inflammatory signaling pathway. As the PCSCs possess various drug-resistance
  mechanism, such as overexpression of drug-resistance protein, anti-apoptotic capacity
  to overcome apoptosis, a dormant state is beneficial to prevent drug-induced death.
