caption: 'The comparison of inflammation status in lung tissue and peripheral blood
  between COPD patients with or without HUA. A HE staining detected alveolar cells
  morphology (X20) and MASSON staining of lung tissue (X20). Scale bars, 50 μm. B
  Quantification of cell counts according to HE staining and fibrotic area of difference
  groups by MASSON staining (X20). Scale bars, 50 μm. C Expression of inflammatory
  factors, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and MUC1 were detected in lung by multiplex immunofluorescences(X20).
  Scale bars, 50 μm. The immunofluorescence quantification of mean fluorescence intensity
  was indicated in the bar plot. D Multiplex immunofluorescences of location of Antitrypsin
  and Elane in lung tissues(X20). Scale bars, 50 μm. E The level of IL-6, IL-8, Antitrypsin
  and Elane in plasma from two groups detected by ELISA (unpaired t test, *P < 0.05
  and ****P < 0.001). Abbreviation: COPD, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease; HUA,
  hyperuricemia; HE, Hematoxylin & Eosin; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-8, interleukin-8;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; DAPI, 4’,6-Diamidino-2’-phenylindol; MUC1, mucin 1'
article_title: Extracellular vesicles isolated from hyperuricemia patients might aggravate
  airway inflammation of COPD via senescence-associated pathway.
