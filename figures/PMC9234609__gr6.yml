caption: miR-146b ameliorates the inflammation phenotypes and M1 macrophage polarization
  of IBD mice in vivo. MiR-146b agomir was injected through the tail vein into IBD
  mice, and miR-146b expression in colon tissues was determined by q-PCR (A). The
  body weight (B), DAI scores (C), colon length (D) and the pathological changes (E)
  in IBD mice. The levels of inflammation-related factors were detected by ELISA assay
  (F), and M1 macrophage polarization-related indicators were determined by Western
  blotting (G).
