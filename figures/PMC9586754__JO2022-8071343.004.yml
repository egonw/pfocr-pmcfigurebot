caption: The BxPC3-RR cells with ZFP57 overexpression and transfected with the corresponding
  control were injected into subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Then, the transplanted
  tumor was irradiated by 10 Gy of different types of radiation once every two days
  for three times consecutively. (a) The nude mice with the transplanted tumors were
  killed after four weeks of radiotherapy at 10 Gy, and the photos were taken at the
  transplanted tumors. (b) The transplanted tumor volume was measured every week after
  radiotherapy at 10 Gy. (c) The weight of the transplanted tumor was determined.
  (d) The expressions of ZFP57, Ki67, Bax, CDK4, β-catenin, and γ-H2AX were determined
  in the transplanted tumors by WB. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
