caption: Ewing sarcoma tumors and cell lines are sensitive to statin treatment. (A)
  Boxplot of median dependency scores for mevalonate pathway enzymes and prenyltransferases
  in 25 Ewing sarcoma cell lines upon CRISPR lethality screening (DepMap portal, Avana
  library). The blue box highlights genes with a median dependency score < −0.5 in
  Ewing cell lines. (B) Comparison of the mean expression level of mevalonate pathway
  enzymes and prenyltransferases across various tumor cell lines (DepMap portal) [].
  Data are presented as min-to-max boxplots with median; **** p value < 0.0001, unpaired
  Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction. (C) Results of the high-throughput compound
  screening using the Prestwick library with one dose of treatment (10 µM) and two
  time points (24 h and 72 h) using the A673 Ewing cell line. Among the 187 hit compounds,
  110 compounds can be grouped into 10 different functional and structural families.
  A total of 5 out of 6 statins available in the Prestwick library induced a decrease
  in cell proliferation after 24 h of treatment and demonstrated major cytotoxicity
  at 72 h. (D) Boxplots of the log2FC of fluorescent intensity of the different tumor
  groups upon Atorvastatin and Simvastatin treatment normalized to DMSO treatment.
  The red boxplots correspond to Ewing cell lines and the green boxplots to the mean
  of all other tumors. Data are represented as 10–90% percentiles with median (line)
  and mean (dot) obtained with Bayesian Student’s t-tests (data from the DepMap portal).
  (E) Dose–response curves and IC50 values of Atorvastatin for 4 Ewing cell lines
  (A673, TC71, SKNMC, and POE), 4 dissociated cells from Ewing PDX (IC-pPDX-80, IC-pPDX-87,
  IC-pPDX-164, and IC-pPDX-3), and 4 non-Ewing cell lines (KD, malignant rhabdoid
  tumor; SKNSH, neuroblastoma; MCF7, breast cancer; A549, lung carcinoma). Cell viability
  was quantified by cell counting with trypan blue exclusion after 72 h of treatment
  with 6 doses of atorvastatin and expressed as the percentage relative to cells treated
  with DMSO (n = 2).
