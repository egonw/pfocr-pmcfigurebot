caption: CLEFMA induced MAPK pathway activation in human OSCC. (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC-9
  cells were incubated with CLEFMA (0–8 μM). Cell lysates were subjected to Western
  blot assay for defining the protein level of MAPK-related pathways. The densitometry
  of MAPK-related protein- associated signals of (C) HSC-3 and (D) SCC-9 cells detected
  in (A,B), respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05 compared with the DMSO vehicle.
