figure_title: Calcineurin-dependent signaling is not required for TFEB/TFE3 nuclear
  localization in cells lacking Tsg101
caption: Maximum intensity projection confocal images of fixed RKO cells at 48 h post
  transfection showing intracellular distribution of TFEB or TFE3 (green) in ESCRT-I–depleted
  (siTsg101#2) or control (Ctrl#1, nontargeting siRNA) cells upon 2 h treatment with
  vehicle (Vh, DMSO) or 25 μM cyclosporin A (CsA). Cell nuclei marked with DAPI stain
  (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. Dot plots on the right showing the percentage of cells
  with nuclear TFEB or TFE3 localization. Values derived from independent experiments
  (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested
  by comparison to siCtrl#1 conditions. ns, nonsignificant, **P < 0.01.
