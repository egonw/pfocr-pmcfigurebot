figure_title: Short term docetaxel treatment is associated with increased phosphorylation
  of PI3K/AKT pathway effectors in preclinical prostate cancer models
caption: 'a Schematic of the assay procedure. b Western blot profile of indicated
  PI3K/AKT pathway markers in lysates from adherent docetaxel-persister PTEN null
  and PTEN WT prostate cancer cells treated for 24 h with 0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 nM
  docetaxel or DMSO control. Loading control: Vinculin (LNCaP, C4-2); GAPDH (PC346
  Flu1, PC3, DU145, LAPC4, 22RV1, VCaP). c Pharmacodynamic changes in phosphorylation
  levels of p70S6K (T421/S424) and hyperphosphorylated levels of 4EBP1 in PTEN null
  (HID28 and PAC120) and PTEN WT (CTG-2428 and VCaP) xenograft models. Tumours were
  collected from animals on day 4 after one dose of docetaxel on day 1. Data normalised
  to the geomean of β-actin and shown as percentage change from control plotted as
  mean ± SEM (n = 5). Statistical analysis ANOVA test vs vehicle treated, *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.005, ****p < 0.001.'
