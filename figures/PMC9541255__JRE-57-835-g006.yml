caption: Immune response of macrophages to various concentrations of LiCl and β‐catenin
  nuclear translocation. (A and B) Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that the
  exposure to LiCl in a dose‐dependent manner led to a reduction in the expression
  of pro‐inflammatory M1 marker iNOS along with a distinct increase in the anti‐inflammatory
  M2 marker Arginase expression. (C) In response to the Wnt stimulus, β‐catenin was
  stabilized and translocated to the nucleus, where it exerted its function

  of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
