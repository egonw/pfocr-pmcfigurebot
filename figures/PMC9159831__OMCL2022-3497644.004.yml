caption: 'The reduction of MSTN enhanced AMPK interaction with G6PD. (a) p-Smad2/3,
  Smad2+3 protein content in the nucleus of the cattle muscles. (b) p-Smad2/3, Smad2+3
  protein content in cytoplasm of the cattle muscles. (c) The Western blot results
  of TGF-β nonclassical signaling pathway (p-p38, p-AKT), p-AMPKα1+α2. (d) The binding
  of Smad2/3 to the GP6D promoter 850 region was analyzed by ChIP. (e) Co-IP analysis
  of p-AKT with G6PD in the cattle muscles, Co-IP analysis of AMPK with G6PD in the
  cattle muscles. MT: MSTN knockout cattle group; WT: wild-type cattle group. Data
  presented are means ± SD. One-way ANOVA with post hoc LSD multiple comparison test.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.'
