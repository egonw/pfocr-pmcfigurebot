caption: 'PPV1 infection activates NF-κB associating with p65 and IκBα axis. PK-15
  cells were mock treated or stimulated with PPV1 (MOI = 1). Cells were harvested
  at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hpi. The total protein (a), cytoplasmic protein
  (b), and nuclear protein (c) were subjected to western blotting analysis with antibodies
  against phosphorylated p65, β-actin, and TBP, respectively. (d) After 36 hpi, cells
  were fixed and permeated for IFA. Red: p65 protein; Blue: DAPI; magnification, × 200.
  (e) The cells lysates were processed for western blotting analysis with antibodies
  against IκBα and IKKα. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
  three times. *0.01 < p < 0.05, **p < 0.01'
article_title: TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in PPV1-induced apoptosis
  in PK-15 cells.
