caption: Panel (A) shows the rates of pathological complete response (pCR) and No
  pCR in the whole study population. The expression levels of the biomarkers in the
  nucleus (_N) and in the cytoplasm (_C) are shown in Panel (B) in terms of the immunoreaction
  intensity score (_S), in Panel (C) in terms of multiplication of the immunoreaction
  intensity score with the percentage of cells stained (_SxP), and in Panel (D) in
  terms of the categorized international immunoreactive score (SxP_irs_c).
