caption: 'Model of Adam11 function. Adam11 binds to BMP4 and Frizzled on the plasma
  membrane to increase BMP4 and decrease Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The result of the
  increased BMP4 signaling is the inhibition of the neural markers Sox2 and Sox3.
  The result of the decrease in β-catenin activity is a reduction in CyclinD1 and
  Slug/Snail2, leading to less cell proliferation and delayed EMT. Loss of Adam11
  in CNC leads to an increase in Hsp90ab1 that is known to stabilize Lrp5/6 proteins,
  thus increasing the Wnt receptor signal and β-catenin translocation to the nucleus.
  Given the interaction of Adam11 with Fzd and Lrp, it is likely that the increase
  in Hsp90ab1 is a feedback loop reinforcing the pathway rather than the initial trigger
  of β-catenin activation. Adapted from “Signaling Pathways Underlying EMT and EndMT:
  Emerging Roles in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)”, by BioRender.com (2022).
