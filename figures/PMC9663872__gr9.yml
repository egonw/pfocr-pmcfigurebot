caption: 'Citronellol protected dopaminergic neurons by restoring autophagy pathway.
  Midbrain levels of autophagy markers LC3 and p62 were evaluated by western blotting
  (a). Quantitative evaluation of LC3 and p62 levels were done using ImageJ (b). Values
  are represented as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 compared to control, #p < 0.05 compared
  to rotenone alone treated group, $p = 0.05 compared to control.'
