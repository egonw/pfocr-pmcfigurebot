caption: IFNα/β signaling contributes to efficacy of BEMPEG+NKTR-262 therapy. (A)
  Probability of survival with CT26 tumors in WT mice (open circle), WT mice with
  aIFNAR-1 antibody (open square), BEMPEG+NKTR-262 (red circle), BEMPEG+NKTR-262 with
  aIFNAR-1 antibody (red square), BEMPEG+RT (blue circle), or BEMPEG+RT with aIFNAR-1
  antibody (blue square). *P<0.05, log-rank test. (B) PBL immune phenotyping 7 days
  post-therapy. One-way ANOVA with Šídáks multiple comparisons test. (C) CD62L, GzmA,
  and Ki-67 expression on tumor specific, AH1-A5+ cells. (D) CD62L, GzmA, and Ki-67
  expression on AH1-A5- cells. ANOVA with Šídáks multiple comparisons test. For A–D,
  N=10–14 from two independent experiments, for some markers, one representative of
  the two experiments is shown. ANOVA, analysis of variance; PBL, peripheral blood.
article_title: Combining bempegaldesleukin (CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist)
  and NKTR-262 (TLR7/8 agonist) improves systemic antitumor CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity
  over BEMPEG+RT.
