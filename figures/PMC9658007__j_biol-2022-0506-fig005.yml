caption: Activation of the HMGB1/TLR2/4 signaling pathway in the kidneys of STZ-induced
  diabetic mice. Mice were treated with STZ at 100 or 150 mg/kg by intraperitoneal
  injection. The kidney was dissected on Day 64. Immunohistochemical staining of HMGB1,
  TLR2, and TLR4 in the kidneys (a), photographed at 400× magnification. Protein expression
  of HMGB1 and p-NF-κB in the kidneys by Western blot (b), n = 3. PCNA and β-actin
  were used as internal controls. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, vs the normal group, tested by one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s
  PLSD.
