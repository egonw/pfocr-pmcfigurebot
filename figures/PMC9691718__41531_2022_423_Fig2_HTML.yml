figure_title: RNA velocity demonstrates developmental streams from NPCs into mDA neurons
  reminiscent of a developing midbrain
caption: a Rank abundance plot showing copy number of proteins from proteomic analysis
  with expression of mDA proteins in blue and PD-linked proteins in red. b PCA visualises
  the progression from precursor cells (NPCs) (yellow-red colours) towards mDA neuronal
  cells (blue colours). RNA velocity trajectories are indicated by arrows. c Velocity
  stream visualised in UMAP reveals a more detailed progression of the direction of
  differentiation. d PAGA graph showing the NPC cluster transition into mDA neuron
  clusters. e Velocity inferred latent time analysis visualised in UMAP, showing mDA
  clusters are later (brighter colour) in time than NPC clusters (darker colours).
  f A heatmap listing a selection of cluster driver genes sorted according to their
  inferred latent time. g, h GO enrichment analysis to clarify gene categories per
  cell cluster based on the functional characteristics of the driver genes. g Example
  of GO enrichment of two NPC clusters showing that some clusters are more proliferative
  (left graph), and some are more differentiated and on the neuronal pathway (right
  graph). h Example of two mDA neuron clusters showing complex neuronal pathways which
  are highly activated.
