caption: Crohn’s disease exclusion diet combined with partial enteral nutrition (CDED+PEN)–induced
  and CDED+PEN–sustained remission were associated with specific changes in some kynurenine
  and serotonin pathway metabolites. Volcano plot illustrating the changes in tryptophan
  metabolites comparing (A) induced remission at week 6 (W6_rem) vs W0 or (B) sustained
  remission at W12 (W12_sr) vs W0. Blue dots represent significantly decreased metabolites
  at W6_rem or W12_sr compared with W0, based on t test (≤0.05). Red dots represent
  the significantly increased metabolites. Black dots represent no significant changes.
  (C) The absolute concentrations (pmol/mg) of the significantly changed fecal tryptophan
  metabolites at W0, W6_rem, and W12_sr (≤0.05). W0 (n = 27), W6_rem (n = 13), and
  W12_sr (n = 8).
