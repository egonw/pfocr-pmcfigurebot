figure_title: Integration of gene expression and CRISPR gene dependencies to identify
  metabolic pathway dependencies
caption: A) Schematic outlining the approach for Genetic Pathway Dependency Enrichment
  Analysis (Genetic PDEA). Cancer cell lines from the CCLE were first stratified by
  culture type (adherent, suspension) and culture medium (RPMI, DMEM), and then their
  metabolic pathway activity was inferred using single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). The resulting
  pathway activities were integrated with gene dependency to assess association with
  metabolic pathway activity. B-C) Simulated data (see ) was used to assess the sensitivity
  of the Genetic PDEA approach. The heatmaps represent the percentage of significant
  results at each gradient added. Values added to the expression gradient resulted
  in slightly stronger correlation coefficients and Genetic PDEA results compared
  to values added to dependency gradient.
