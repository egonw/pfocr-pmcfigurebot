caption: 'A Experimental outline of qPCR analysis after dissection of CHT (caudal
  region) at 48 hpf from kdrl:GFP, ikaros:GFP, mpeg1:GFP, mpx:GFP transgenic animals,
  and FACS‐sorted GFP‐positive cells to purify ECs, HSPCs, macrophages, and neutrophils.B,
  C The phospholipases pla2g4aa and pla2g4ab are highly expressed in neutrophils.D–F
  The expression of cyclooxygenases cox1, cox2a, and cox2b is enriched in macrophages.G,
  H The prostaglandin synthases ptges3a and ptges3b are only expressed by ECs.I–M
  The prostaglandin receptors ptger1a, ptger1b, ptger2a, ptger3, and ptger4a are mostly
  expressed in HSPCs.N, O The prostaglandin transporters slco2b1 and abcc4 are specifically
  expressed in ECs. Data information: For each panel, data represent biological triplicates
  plated in technical duplicates. Statistical analysis was completed using one‐way
  ANOVA and multiple comparison tests. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
  Center values denote the mean, and error bars denote s.e.m. Source data are available
  online for this figure.'
