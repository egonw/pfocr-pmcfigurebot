figure_title: ANXA9 is highly expressed in breast cancer
caption: A, B ANXA9 is highly expressed in BC tissues; C BC tissues contained higher
  expression of ANXA9 than para-cancer tissues assessed by Western blot; D The clinical
  pathological data from TCGA showed high expression of ANXA9 was connected with AJCC
  stage of BC (χ2 = 10.29, p = 0.016); E Bioinformatics analysis of TCGA showed high
  levels of ANXA9 were associated with poor outcome among BC patients with metastases
  (n = 184, p = 0.018). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. All of the experiments were replicated
  for three times.
