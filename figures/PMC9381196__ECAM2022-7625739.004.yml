caption: AXL inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in RA model mice. RA model
  mice were induced by collagen antibodies. Lentivirus encapsulated AXL, oe-AXL, and
  oe-NC were injected into left and right ankle joints (a-d) Western blot was used
  to detect the protein expression of p65, phosphor p-p65, and toll-like receptor
  (TLR4) in joint synovium. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
