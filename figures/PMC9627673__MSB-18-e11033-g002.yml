figure_title: Differential pathway utilization inferred by 13C labeling analysis
caption: Schematic representation of fractional difference, difference between each
  metabolite fractional contribution (percentage of 13C labeled) subtracted between
  type 1 and type 2. The metabolites are ranked by their fractional difference, where
  positive values are associated with higher labeling in type 1 and negative values
  with higher labeling in type 2. The bar plot bellow indicates the position of metabolites
  of TCA cycle, where seven metabolites out of 11 were more labeled in type 2.Metabolic
  pathways enrichment computed using metabolites fractional differences. Pathways
  associated to higher labeling in type 1 are displayed in blue and in type 2 in red
  (cell lines n = 9 with three biological replicates, hypergeometric test corrected
  for FDR). Results of labeling experiment using [U‐13C]glucose or [U‐13C]glutamine
  denoted on top of heatmap.
