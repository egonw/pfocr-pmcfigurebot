caption: 'Inhibiting STAT3 signaling at multiple levels for OSCC treatment. Currently,
  the majority of STAT3 inhibitors have been developed to target different sites in
  the STAT3 pathway: (1) targeting the upstream regulators of STAT3 [,], (2) binding
  to the SH2 domain of STAT3 and inhibiting its activation [], (3) inhibiting STAT3
  phosphorylation [], (4) nuclear-targeted siRNA delivery for STAT3 gene silencing
  [,], (5) regulating downstream targets of STAT3 [,,]. Reproduced/adopted in modified
  form from [].'
