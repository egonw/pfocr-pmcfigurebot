caption: G3BP1 was an RNA binding protein to interact with JAK2 mRNA. (A) G3BP1 didn't
  influence the mRNA expression of JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. (B) Knocking down G3BP1 could
  downregulated protein expression of JAK2, but not JAK1 and TYK2. (C) G3BP1 was potential
  to interact with three JAKs mRNA via RBPsuite database. (D) The binding of G3BP1
  protein and JAK2 mRNA was validated by RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay
  (RIP assay). (E) JAK2 mRNA could bind G3BP1 protein by RNA pulldown assay, and the
  interaction could be broken by EGCG. (F) The potential binding sites of G3BP1 protein
  and JAK2 mRNA were preliminarily verified by ultrasonic interruption of RNA and
  the structural inhibitor of G3BP1.
