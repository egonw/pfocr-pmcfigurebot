caption: Serum Kyn levels are increased and associated with Treg proportions in chemotherapy
  resistant gastric cancer patients. (A) ELISA analysis of the secretion of Kyn in
  tumor cells from chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tissues from
  gastric cancer patients. (B) SGC7901 or BGC823 cells were treated with DMSO, Kyn
  (100 μM), 5-Fu, or a combination of 5-Fu and Kyn for 48 h. Cell apoptosis was analyzed
  by flow cytometry. (C) Gating strategy for Treg analysis by flow cytometry. (D)
  Flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of Tregs in tumor cells from chemotherapy-sensitive
  and chemotherapy-resistant tumor tissues. (E) Correlation study between Tregs and
  Kyn in tumor cells from chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tissues
  from gastric cancer patients. (F) CD4+ T cells was purified in vitro. DMSO and Kyn
  (100 μM) were added on day 0, and CD4+ T cells were gated for Treg analyses on day
  3. The percentage of Treg induction was determined by flow cytometry. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay; 5-Fu, 5-fluorouracil; Kyn, kynurenine; SD, standard deviation; Tregs, regulatory
  T cells.
