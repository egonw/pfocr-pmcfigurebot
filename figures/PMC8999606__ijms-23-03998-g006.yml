caption: Transcriptomic changes in HepG2 cells after 72 h of TEHP (100 Î¼M) exposure.
  (A) Heat map displaying upregulated (red boxes), downregulated (green boxes), and
  (gray boxes) undetermined genes in the array. (B) Genes that has exceeded the threshold
  of >2.0-fold regulation is shown in scatter plot. (C) Annotation of human cancer
  pathway genes, their location in array plate and fold regulation is depicted in
  the panel.
