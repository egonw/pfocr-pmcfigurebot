caption: 'LINC00941 silencing inhibited the viability and migration of laryngocarcinoma
  cells by downregulating PKM level. (A‐B) The expression of PKM in SNU‐46 and SNU‐899
  cells with transfection with shLINC00941 vector or PKM overexpression vector or
  with co‐transfection with shLINC00941 vector and PKM overexpression vector were
  measured by western blot assay. GAPDH served as an inner reference in western blot
  assay. (C‐D) The viability of SNU‐46 and SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941
  vector or PKM overexpression vector or with co‐transfection with shLINC00941 vector
  and PKM vector was assessed by CCK‐8 assay. (E‐F) The migration ability of SNU‐46
  and SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or PKM overexpression vector
  or co‐transfected with shLINC00941 vector and PKM vector was determined by cell
  scratch assay (magnification: ×100; scale: 50 µm). *p or ^p or +p < 0.05; **p or
  ^^p or ++p < 0.01; ***p or ^^^p or +++p < 0.001; * vs. Empty vector; ^ vs. shLINC00941;
  + vs. shLINC00941+PKM (CCK‐8, cell counting kit‐8; PKM, pyruvate kinase M/pyruvate
  kinase M vector; shLINC00941, short hairpin RNA vector for LINC00941)'

  by upregulating PKM via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
