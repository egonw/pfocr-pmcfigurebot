caption: 'MiR-30e-3p regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via inhibiting
  THO complex 2 expression in gastric cancer cells. A and B: AGS or BGC-823 cells
  were transfected with NC, miR-30e-3p inhibitors or miR-30e-3p mimics. The relative
  protein expression of THO complex 2 (THOC2), PI3K, AKT and mTOR was detected by
  western blot after 48 h; C and D: AGS or BGC-823 cells were transfected with NC,
  siTHOC2 or left untreated (blank). The relative protein expression of THOC2, PI3K,
  AKT and mTOR was detected by western blot after 48 h; E and F: AGS or BGC-823 cells
  were transfected with NC, miR-30e-3p inhibitor, miR-30e-3p inhibitor and si-THOC2.
  The relative protein expression of THOC2, PI3K, AKT and mTOR was detected by western
  blot after 48 h. n = 3 for each group. bP < 0.01.'
