caption: 'WGCNA of GSE193677 to obtain the key genes APOL1 and CXCL1. (A) The GO enrichment
  analysis of the Brown module. (B and C) The Brown module was positively correlated
  with endoscopic and clinical scores (correlations, 0.48 and 0.51, respectively;
  P < 0.0001). (D) Brown module were identified as potential candidate genes, and
  after screening, we obtained two genes related to our study: APOL1 and CXCL1.'
