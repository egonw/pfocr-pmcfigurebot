caption: IFI16 or p204/Ifi-204 interferon signaling pathway. IFI16 or p204/Ifi-204
  recognizes dsDNA via HIN domains, which induce HIN domains’ oligomerization, leading
  to the clustering of PYD domains. Next, the IFI16-DNA complexes travel to STING
  localized in perinuclear areas and then TBK1 and IRF3 are recruited. STING and IRF3
  are phosphorylated by TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3 translocates to the nucleus and
  activates the production of IFN β. The possible overlapping of the cGAS pathway
  with the IFI16-STING pathway is shown (the stabilization of IFI16 by cGAS or the
  requirement of 2′-3′ cGAMP for IFI16 STING stimulation). Created with BioRender.com.
