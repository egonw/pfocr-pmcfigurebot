caption: SGLT2 Inhibitors Versus GLP-1RAs in Patients With ASCVD and CKDThe bars represent
  absolute effects of treatment per 1,000 patients treated for 5 years in patients
  with ASCVD and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors were more effective than GLP-1RAs in reducing
  total death and hospitalization due to heart failure, whereas GLP-1RAs were more
  effective than SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing stroke. Both drugs shared similar efficacy
  in CV death, nonfatal MI, and kidney failure. ∗P < 0.05. Data adapted from Palmer
  et at () with permission. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CKD = chronic
  kidney disease; CV = cardiovascular; HHF = hospitalization for heart failure; MI = myocardial
  infarction; other abbreviations as in  and .
