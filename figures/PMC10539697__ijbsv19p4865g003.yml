caption: 'TOF promotes neural structure regeneration and inhibits glial scar formation
  after SCI. (A) Representative images of co-immunofluorescence staining for GAP43
  (green) and GFAP (red) on day 28 post-injury in spinal cord lesion areas. TOP row:
  White dashed lines indicate the lesion border, and yellow boxes indicate the area
  of axonal structures in the lesion epicenter. Middle and bottom row: Magnifications
  of boxed region in the upper row. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale
  bar, 500 μm (top), 100 μm (middle) and 20 μm (bottom). (B) Representative images
  of MAP2 (green) and GFAP (red) immunohistochemical staining on day 14 post-injury
  in the lesion site. Left: White boxes show the junctional region between lesion
  area and normal area. Right: Magnifications of the boxed regions. Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 500 μm (left), 100 μm and 20 μm (right). (C) Quantification
  of the fluorescence intensity and lesion area on day 28 (top) and 14 (bottom) post-injury.
  (The values are presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, Student''s
  t tests; n = 3 per group). (D) Western blot analysis and quantification of MAP2
  and GFAP expression in spinal cord on day 14 post-injury (The values are presented
  as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, one-way ANOVA; n = 3 rats per group). (E) LFB staining
  of transverse section on day 28 post-injury. High-magnification view of area around
  the damage boundary are shown on the right. Scale bar, 500 μm (left), 100 μm (right).'
