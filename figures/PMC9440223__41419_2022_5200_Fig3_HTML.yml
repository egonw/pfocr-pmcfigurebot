figure_title: KCTD9 inhibits CRC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro
caption: A Western blotting analysis of the CRC cell lines LoVo and SW620 after infection
  with lentiviral particles based on control pCDH or pCDH-KCTD9 vectors to overexpress
  KCTD9. β-actin was used as a loading control. Data shown represent three independent
  experiments (top) and relative density were quantified by using ImageJ software
  (bottom). B Assessment of cell viability in the cells from A measured using CCK-8
  assays. C Assessment of proliferation in the cells from A measured using Count Star
  (Countstar BioTech) over 1–4 days by cell counting. D, E Assessment of migration
  in the cells from A measured in wound healing assays. Representative images at time
  0 and 48 h (scale bar=200 µm) (D) with quantitation of wound closure (E). D represent
  three independent experiments. F, G Assessment of migration and invasion in the
  cells from A using Transwell™ assays. Representative images of migrating/invading
  cells after 24 h (scale bar =200 µm) (F) with comparative quantitation of total
  migrating cells (G). F Represent three independent experiments. A, B, E, G Are mean ± SD,
  n = 3 independent experiments, two-tailed Student’s t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001. C is mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments, two-way ANOVA with
  Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test, **p < 0.01.
