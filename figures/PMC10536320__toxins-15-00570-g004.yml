caption: (A) The supernatant of lactic acid bacteria inhibits quorum sensing in Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa. The QS systems involve the signal synthases LasI and the receptors LasR
  in P. aeruginosa. The Las systems employ acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL), which are
  autoinducer signaling molecules. The Las system controls pyochelin, elastase, and
  virulence factors. (B) The lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis affected the
  quorum-sensing (QS) system in S. aureus via regulation of the auto inducer 2 (AI-2).
  The QS systems involve the signal synthases LuxS and the AI-2 receptors in S. aureus.
  AI-2 derived from DPD (4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione) synthesized by LuxS synthase
  in the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) recycling pathway.
