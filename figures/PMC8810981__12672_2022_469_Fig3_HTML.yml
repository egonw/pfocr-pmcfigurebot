caption: Knockdown of CENPO enhanced apoptosis in CRC cells. A Flow cytometry analysis
  based on Annexin V-APC and PI staining was utilized to detect the apoptotic for
  HCT116 and RKO cells. B The alterations of apoptotic signaling pathway were preliminarily
  explored in CENPO knock downed HCT116 cells through Human apoptosis antibody array
  analysis. The presented results were representative of experiments repeated at least
  three times. Data was represented as mean  ±  SD. *P  < 0.05, **P  < 0.01, ***P 
  < 0.001
