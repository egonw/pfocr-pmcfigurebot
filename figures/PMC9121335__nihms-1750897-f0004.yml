caption: 'Targeted metabolomics in control and bleomycin exposed cells. Levels of:
  A) Pyruvate, lactate, and TCA cycle intermediates; B) Glutamine, glutamate and α-ketoglutrate;
  C) Pentose phosphate pathway intermediates; and D) Amino acids. The metabolites
  were extracted after 24h of bleomycin (10, 50 μg/ml) exposure in standard culture
  medium containing glucose, glutamine and pyruvate. Data plotted with mean and standard
  errors. ( *P < 0.05, **P<0.01) versus control group, n=6)'

  cells.
