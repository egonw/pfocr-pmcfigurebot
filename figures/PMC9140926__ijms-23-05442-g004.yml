caption: 'Effect of PUG on the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) on activated
  RAW264.7 macrophage cells. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated without or with LPS (1
  μg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then the cells were treated with PUG (4, and 6μM) for 24
  h at 37 °C. The treated cell culture media were collected and used for the IL-6
  determination. The wells were read, and absorbance values were used for the graph
  plot. The standard deviation and error were calculated from the replicates of the
  samples and the Four Parameter Logistic curve (4PL) method was used to determine
  the IL-6 concentration. The statistical significance was ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated
  group; and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS-alone treated group.'
