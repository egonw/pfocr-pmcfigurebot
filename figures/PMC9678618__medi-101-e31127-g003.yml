caption: Identification of differentially expressed ANOIKIS- and immune-related genes.
  (A) The intersection of targeting ANOIKIS DEGs and ImmuneScore DEGs. (B) Results
  of the gene ontology (GO) term enrichment study. (C) Results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment study. (D) 143 Hub genes of PPI network.
  The line represents the interaction between the genes. The darker the color, the
  bigger the degrees. DEGs = differentially expressed genes, PPI = protein-protein
  interaction.
article_title: A novel Anoikis and immune-related genes marked prognostic signature
  for colorectal cancer.
