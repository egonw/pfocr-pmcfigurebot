caption: TSPAN31 and METTL1/CCT2 expression levels are positively correlated. (A)
  The String database was used to predict the genes that might be co-expressed with
  TSPAN31. (B) The expression levels of METTL1 and CCT2 in GC were analyzed by the
  GEPIA database. (C) The expression levels of METTL1 and CCT2 in 37 pairs of GC tissues
  were detected by qRT-PCR. (D) The relationship between the expression levels of
  TSPAN31 and METTL1, TSPAN31 and CCT2, and METTL1 and CCT2 in GC was determined by
  the GEPIA database. (E) The correlation of the expression levels between TSPAN31
  and METTL1, TSPAN31 and CCT2, and METTL1 and CCT2 in GC was analyzed by Pearson's
  correlation method. (F and G) After the downregulation or upregulation of TSPAN31
  in GC cells, the expression levels of METTL1 and CCT2 were detected by qRT-PCR.
  (H and I) Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of METTL1
  and CCT2 after TSPAN31 downregulation or upregulation. (J) The protein expression
  level of METTL1 after GC cells were transfected with shCCT2 or CCT2 OE (K) The protein
  expression level of CCT2 after GC cells were transfected with sh METTL1 or METTL1
  OE (*P < 0.05;⁎⁎P < 0.01; ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001).
