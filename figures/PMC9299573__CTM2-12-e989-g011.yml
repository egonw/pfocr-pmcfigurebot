caption: 'Exosomes derived from cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit miR‐20a
  upregulation. (A) α‐SMA, FSP1, PDFGRβ, vimentin, fibronectin, CD31, CD45 and cytokeratin
  levels were measured via Western blotting in CAFs and normal tissue‐associated fibroblasts
  (NAFs). (B) α‐SMA, vimentin and fibronectin levels were assessed by immunofluorescent
  staining in the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th generations of CAFs and NAFs. (C) CD63, CD81
  and TSG101 levels were measured via Western blotting in CAFs, NAFS and exosomes
  derived from these cells. (D) CAF‐ or NAF‐condition media‐derived exosomes were
  analyzed via electron microscopy (scale bar, 100 nm). (E and F) Vesicles derived
  from CAF‐ or NAF‐conditioned media were analyzed via a nanoparticle tracking analysis.
  (G) Relative miR‐20a expression in exosomes derived from CAFs and NAFs. (H) After
  treatment with 2 mg/ml RNase alone or combined with .1% Triton X‐100, miR‐20a level
  was analysed using qPCR in the culture medium of CAFs. (I) miR‐20a expression levels
  in NAFs, TGF‐β‐NAFs and A549, H838 and HCC827 cells were assessed via qPCR. (J)
  miR‐20a expression was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
  non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and healthy pulmonary tissue. (K) Quantitative
  analysis of relative fluorescence intensity. Results are representative data from
  triplicate experiments, and outcomes are means ± standard deviation (SD) (**p < .01,
  ***p < .001 vs. CAFs; ##p< .01 vs. NAFs)'

  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
