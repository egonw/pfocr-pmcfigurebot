caption: The inflorescence of ein2-1 and ein3-1 eil1-1 is insensitive to exogenous
  ethylene treatment. (A–D) The inflorescence of ein2-1 (A), ein3-1eil1-1 (B), ein3-1
  (C) and eil1-1 (D) after treated with ethylene (100 µL L−1) for 24 h. After ethylene
  treatment, these plants were transferred to normal growth condition for 14 days.
