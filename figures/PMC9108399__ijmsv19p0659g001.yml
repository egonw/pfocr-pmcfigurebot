caption: 'The GFRα and GFRα-mediated signaling pathways. a The GFRα family consists
  of four members, GFRα1, GFRα2, GFRα3 and GFRα4, which are tethered to the plasma
  membrane through GPI anchors containing CRDs. They have four characteristic ligands,
  namely, GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN. Two GFL monomers form an entangled homodimer
  to corresponding GFRα coreceptors. After GFLs and GFRα bind, the complexes associate
  with RET, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase coreceptor, forming a GFL-GFRα-RET ternary
  complex. b RET-dependent GFRα signaling is activated via phosphorylation of GFRα
  on multiple intracellular tyrosines. Two signal transduction pathways contribute
  to GFL-induced RET activation: via membrane-bound GFRα (cis-signaling) and soluble
  GFRα (trans-signaling) molecules released from nearby cells. Only the Ras/MAPK and
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are represented in the figure. c The presence of GDNF
  promotes the association of CFRα with NCAM, resulting in activation of the NCAM-mediated
  Fyn-FAK-MAPK signaling pathway. Other non-RET receptors of GFRα need further study.
  LICAM, ligand-induced cell adhesion molecules; NCAM, Neural cell adhesion molecule.'
