caption: Schematic of the ACE-mediated cleavage of peptides for MHC Class I and II
  presentation. During MHC Class I (red arrows) antigen preparation, cytoplasmic proteins
  are processed into peptide fragments via the proteasome. These peptides can be further
  processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via ACE, which provides further alterations
  for increased specificity and selection by CD8+ T lymphocytes. The MHC Class II
  pathway (blue arrows) is for exogenous and endogenous protein digestion within endosomes
  and lysosomes. Newly synthesised MHC II associates with the invariant chain within
  the ER, before shuttling the complex to the endocytic pathway. The invariant chain
  is trimmed to CLIP which remains bound to MHC Class II. Once in the lysosome, CLIP
  binds HLA-DM to facilitate peptide binding to MHC Class II. The complex is then
  directed to the cell surface for antigen presentation to CD4+ T lymphocytes.
