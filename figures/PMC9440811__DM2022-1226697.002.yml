caption: ANTXR1 promotes erythroid cell proliferation and inhibits erythroid cell
  differentiation and apoptosis in cord blood CD34+ cells. (a) Western blot analysis
  was used to detect ANTXR1 levels after transfection of cord blood CD34+ cells with
  ANTXR1 overexpression vectors. (b) Quantification of western blots. (c) CCK8 assay
  of cord blood CD34+ cells proliferation at D6, D7, D8, and D9. (d) Flow cytometry
  detection of CD71 and CD235a expression in cord blood CD34+ cells during erythroid
  differentiation. (e) Wright-Giemsa staining results of cord blood CD34+ cells. (f)
  Flow cytometry to detect the expression of apoptotic cells in the differentiation
  of cord blood CD34+ cells. Error bars represent standard deviation of three independent
  experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
