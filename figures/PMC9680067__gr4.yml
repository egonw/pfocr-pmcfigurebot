caption: Signaling pathways of NLRC3, NLRC5. In mammals, NLC3 inhibit TLR signaling
  via TRAF6, type I/II/III IFN response and immune pathways viz. STING, NF-kB, ERK,
  P13K/AKT/mTOR, TCR. It also competes with ASC to bind with pro-caspase-1 and interferes
  with the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition to generally inducing MHC class
  I genes, NLRC5 inhibit RIG-1, MDA5 and type I IFN as well modulate immune pathways
  such as NF-kB, JAK2/STAT3, AKT/VEGF-A, PI3/AKT and IFN-1 pathway. In teleosts, NLRC3/C3L
  modulate cytokine expression while (possibly) interacting with RIPK (denoted by
  red/dotted lines). NLRC3L is reported to inhibit NOD1-mediated downstream signaling
  pathways (denoted by red line). NLRC3 is also reported to interact with ASC, however
  the downstream signaling remains elusive. (STING- stimulator of interferon genes,
  NF-kB- nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, ERK- extracellular
  signal- regulated kinase, P13K- phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, AKT- Protein kinase
  B, mTOR- mammalian target of rapamycin, TCR- T cell receptor, ASC- apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD, IFN- interferon, MDA5- melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5, RIG-1- retinoid acid -inducible gene I, JAK/STAT- janus kinase/signal
  transducers and activators of transcription, VEGF-A- Vascular endothelial growth
  factor A, MHC- major histocompatibility complex, RIPK- receptor interacting protein
  kinase).
