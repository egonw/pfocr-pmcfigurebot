caption: Predicted versus actual IC50s based on limited gene MVR models. (A,B) predicted
  IC50s were derived from a 4-gene subset (C5ORF38, DAAM1, IRX2, CD70) of the 9 eribulin
  UFGs. (C,D) predicted IC50s were derived from a 5-gene subset (EPHA2, NGEF, SEPTIN10,
  TRIP10, VSIG10) of the 13 vinorelbine UFGs. (A,C) linear regressions of predicted
  versus actual IC50s for all 100 cell lines. (B,D) predicted versus actual mean IC50s
  (Â±SEM) for the most sensitive and least sensitive cell line quartiles as defined
  in . For (A,C), linear regression lines (solid) are shown together with their corresponding
  95% confidence bands (dotted). For visual comparison, scales of x- and y-axes were
  kept the same between both panels here and Panels (A,B) of . No statistically significant
  differences were found between predicted and actual quartile mean IC50s in (B) or
  (D).
