caption: 'Overexpression of CXCR4 restores the inhibition of cell migration and invasion
  caused by RON reduction. 5637 cells GV141/CXC4 or control were added to shRON (+)
  or shNC (-). The wound healing assay was performed to evaluate the capability of
  cell migration (A, B). The transwell assay was used to detect the cell invasion
  ability (C, D). Cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using the
  indicated antibodies to CXCR4, RON, E-cadherin, and vimentin, respectively (E).
  Data are shown as mean Â± SEM, from one of 3 independent experiments. *P<0.05, versus
  absence of GV141/CXCR4 and shRON treatment, #P < 0.05, versus GV141/CXCR4 treatment.'

  to enhance CXCR4 expression and promote cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer.
