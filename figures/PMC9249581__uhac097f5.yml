caption: 'a) Schematic representation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway; b) Carotenoid
  content quantified by HPLC methods; c) Expression profiles of biosynthetic genes
  measured by Real time qPCR in samples from mature green (MG), breaker (B), breaker
  +7 days (B + 7) and ripe (R) fruits in WT and Bronze tomato line (n = 3). Biosynthetic
  genes are named according to the following abbreviations: GGPS, geranyl-geranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase; PSY1, phytoene synthase 1; LCYB, β-lycopene cyclase 1. Significance
  assumed at *p < 0.05.'
