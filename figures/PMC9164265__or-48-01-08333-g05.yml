caption: 'CSF2 silencing inhibits the transformation from the adherent phenotype to
  the suspension phenotype. H69A was transfected with CSF2 shRNA. (A) The mRNA level
  of CSF2 was determined using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. (B) CSF2 protein
  expression was detected by using western blotting. (C) Quantitative analysis of
  (B): H69A cells transfected with the control plasmid was used as the control (100%).
  Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  (D) The conversion rate from the adherent phenotype to the suspended phenotype was
  detected by using trypan blue staining. (E) Cell viability was detected by using
  Alamar Blue. (F) The levels of SYP, CD44 and GAPDH were detected by using western
  blotting (*P<0.05, vs. the control group). (G) Quantitative analysis of (F): H69A
  cells transfected with the control plasmid were used as the control (100%). Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments (*P<0.05).
