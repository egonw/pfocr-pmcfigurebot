caption: 'The impact of LGN TUS on VEPs outlasts the duration of sonication. Effect
  of LGN (red) and non-LGN control (gray, 10–15 mm anterior of LGN) sonication on
  VEPs for the three interleaved stimulus conditions (Light-only, Light-plus-TUS and
  TUS-only). (A) Top row: Mean + /- SEM VEP waveforms in the Light-only condition
  for LGN (red line, N = 6) and non-LGN control (gray line, N = 5) sonication. Responses
  were smoothed (15-point moving averages filter) for illustration purposes. Bottom
  row: Boxplots of VEP Peak-to-peak amplitude for LGN and non-LGN control sonication,
  light-only trials. (*p = 0.004, one-tailed unpaired t-test). Box depicts interquartile
  range, and dashed error bars depict full range of values. (B) Data presented as
  in A, but for the light-plus-TUS condition. Gray bar illustrates time course of
  TUS relative to visual stimulus onset. Difference between LGN and non-LGN: p = 0.07.
  (C) Data presented as in A, for the TUS-only condition (i.e., no visual stimulus).
  Note the minimal overall response, indicative of little-to-no nonspecific auditory
  or somatosensory responses to transducer vibration. The transient ~ 100 ms increase
  in voltage at TUS onset with LGN stimulation, is primarily due to responses in a
  single animal (see outlier dot in bottom row), indicative potentially of a subtle
  depolarizing effect of LGN-TUS in this animal, and/or an EEG artifact of TUS.'
