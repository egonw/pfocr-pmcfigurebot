caption: Mechanism of CRT-mediated chemosensitivity in HCC cells via nucleus translocation
  and reduction in CaM/CaMKII/CREB signaling. We revealed that decreased expression
  of CRT lead to down-regulated the chemosensitivity of HDACi in HCC cells. Moreover,
  we also obtain that CRT translocation into the nucleus is an important mechanism
  of chemoresistance and HDACi-induced cell apoptosis in HCC cells.
