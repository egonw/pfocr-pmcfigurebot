figure_title: Fitness advantage of cancer-driving mutations enables the creation of
  a progressive series of genome-edited, human cancer models
caption: '(A) Experimental approach for introducing sequential melanoma mutations
  into the genomes of primary human melanocytes using CRISPR/Cas9. RNP: ribonucleoprotein.
  AAV: adeno-associated virus. (B) Editing tree. The nine isogenic models of melanoma
  generated (boxes), the perturbed genes in each model (inside box), the genotype
  abbreviation (beige boxes), and the molecular pathway dysregulated by the most recent
  genome edit (red text). (C-E) Sequential introduction of first three mutations by
  CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of wild-type (‘WT’) melanocytes. (C) First mutation:
  CDKN2A (‘C’). (D) Second mutation: BRAF (‘B’). (E) Third mutation: TERT (‘T’). TERT
  editing confers replicative immortality to CB melanocytes. Allele frequencies of
  each engineered mutation (y axis) shown over time (x axis). #: measurement of allele
  frequency discontinued due to cell senescence. (F) Addition of the −124C>T TERT
  promoter mutation activates TERT expression. Mean of log 10 number of TERT and β-actin
  (ACTB) transcripts (y axis) measured by qPCR in CB (black) and CBT (red) cells.
  Error bars: SD. n=3. *: p < 0.01, one-tailed, one-sample Student’s t-test. (G-I)
  Introduction of fourth mutation into CBT melanocytes. (G) Allele frequencies of
  knockout of PTEN (‘P’), (H) knockout of TP53 (‘3’), and (I) knockout of APC (‘A’).
  (J-K) Introduction of fifth mutations into CBTP melanocytes (J) Allele frequency
  of knockout of PTEN and (K) knockout of TP53. Allele frequencies (y axis) shown
  over time (x axis), as assessed by indels in the respective loci in genomic DNA.'
