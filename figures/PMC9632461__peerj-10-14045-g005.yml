figure_title: Effects of CA on the PINK1/Parkin pathway of H2O2-treated murine LMSCs
caption: '(A) The mRNA levels of PINK1 and Parkin in groups. (B) The protein expression
  levels of PINK1 in groups. (C) The protein expression levels of Parkin in groups.
  #P < 0.05 versus CTRL groups; *P < 0.05 versus H2O2 groups. Data were obtained from
  three independent experiments.'
