caption: 'ETA attenuates NASH by downregulating the NF-κB/TNF-α/TGF-β1 signaling pathway
  activated by the HFHF model. Comparison data from the HFHF-fed rats and standard
  chow-fed rats (CTRL) are shown: immunohistochemically stained liver tissues of the
  normal control group (a–c) show no TGF-β1 (a) and TNF-α (b) expression and normal
  brown cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes with no evidence of nuclear staining (c).
  The stained tissues of the HFHF group (d–f) show a significant increase of TGF-β1
  (d) and TNF-α (e) positively stained cells and a significant increase of NF-κB positively
  stained cells with diffuse and extensive nuclear staining (f). The stained tissues
  of the ETA-treated group (g–i) show a few TGF-β1 (g) and TNF-α (h) positively stained
  cells along with sparse cells with brown nuclear staining (i). TGF-β1, TNF-α, and
  NF-κB immunohistochemical staining; scale bar = 100 µm. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SD values and are representative of a single independent experiment (n = 6).
  Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple
  comparison tests. aSignificantly different from the normal control group. bSignificantly
  different from the HFHF group. Differences were considered significant if the p-value
  was < 0.05. CTRL control, ETA etanercept, HFHF high-fat high-fructose diet, NF-κB
  nuclear factor kappa beta, TGF-β1 transforming growth factor beta, TNF-α tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha.'
