caption: Aerobic respiration vs. anerobic respiration. (A). Normal, non-cancerous
  cells prefer aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen. The conversion
  of glucose to pyruvate is facilitated by glycolysis. The citric acid cycle then
  transforms pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, also creating ATP, NADH and
  FADH. ATP is produced via oxidative phosphorylation of NADH and FADH, which fuels
  the electron transport chain. (B). When oxygen is scarce, cells switch to anaerobic
  respiration to generate ATP. Pyruvate cannot enter the citric acid cycle after glycolysis
  and is instead converted to lactate to avoid its accumulation. The NADH produced
  during glycolysis is converted back into NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue.
  When oxygen levels return to baseline, cells resume aerobic respiration.
