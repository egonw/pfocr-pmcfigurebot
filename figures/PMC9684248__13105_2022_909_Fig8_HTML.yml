caption: 'Pyroptosis in TB. Pyroptosis can promote the host clearance of Mtb. When
  Mtb invades the host, it is phagocytosed by macrophages to form a phagosome, which
  activates inflammatory response and restricts the growth of Mtb. EST12, which is
  secreted by Mtb, triggers pyroptosis through activating the RACK1/NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD
  signaling pathway, which improves the clearance of intracellular Mtb. Additionally,
  Mtb produces PnkF to suppress the potassium efflux and generation of ROS. Sequentially,
  the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis is inhibited, which leads to the
  Mtb escaping from host clearance. Furthermore, the phagosome of Mtb inhibits the
  activation of the AIM2 inflammasome which is an important molecule in the pyroptotic
  pathway by an unknown mechanism to evade the host elimination. Additionally, Mtb-induced
  pyroptosis can trigger the dissemination of bacteria. Phagocytosed Mtb causes ERS
  which leads to the upregulated TXNIP via activating the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway.
  Increased TXNIP leads to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Meanwhile, Mtb triggers
  the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing plasma damage. The NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent
  pyroptosis then occurs and results in the growth and spread of Mtb. Note: TB, tuberculosis;
  Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; RACK1, receptor for
  activated C kinase 1; GSDMD, gasdermin D; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; PERK,
  protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting
  protein; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2α; CHOP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding
  protein homologous protein'
