caption: MDK mediates the pro‐viability, pro‐migration and activating abilities of
  SRGN CM on HEFs. (A) Effect of rhMDK treatment on FAP expression in HEFs. (B) GO
  analysis of differentially expressed genes (identified by RNA‐sequencing) in HEFs
  after treatment with rhMDK for 7 days. The top 20 enriched GO terms in the biological
  process category were shown. (C) Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)
  pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes in rhMDK‐treated
  HEFs. The top 20 pathways ranked by −log10(P value) were shown. Effects of rhMDK
  on (D) viability (n = 6) and (E) migration (n = 3) of HEFs. Scale bar, 200 μm. Effects
  of SRGN CM on (F) viability (n = 6) and (G) migration (n = 3) of HEFs were attenuated
  by MDK‐knockdown (scale bar, 200 μm)
