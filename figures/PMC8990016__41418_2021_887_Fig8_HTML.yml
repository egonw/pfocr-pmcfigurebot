figure_title: Adenylyl cyclase inhibition blocks Ddr2Adipo bone phenotypes
caption: A Quantitative μCT analysis of femurs of Ddr2Adipo mice treated with or without
  Adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536. n = 6 femurs from 6 mice for each group. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 as determined by unpaired t-test.
  B Schematic overview of bone-fat crosstalk mediated by Ddr2. In bone marrow microenvironment,
  bone marrow adipocytes modulate osteoblasts. In WT mice, the expression level of
  Adcy5 is low, due to inhibition by Ddr2. The cAMP-PKA signaling remains in an inactive
  status. In Ddr2Adipo mice, expression of Adcy5 is increased, leading to stimulated
  cAMP-PKA pathway and subsequent increased lipolysis and fatty acid release. Uptake
  of fatty acid by nearby osteoblasts stimulates the mitochondrial OXPHOS and provides
  more energy for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. BMA bone marrow adipocyte,
  OB osteoblast, cAMP cyclic adenosine monophosphate, PKA protein kinase A.
