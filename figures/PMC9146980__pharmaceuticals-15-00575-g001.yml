caption: 'Gene silencing mechanism through siRNA in eukaryotic cells by different
  pathways: Through the endogenous pathway, long precursors, i.e., dsRNA or shRNA,
  are cleaved by the enzyme DICER into mature siRNA (1a). Via the exogenous pathway,
  the synthetic siRNA will enter a vesicle through the endosome and will be released
  into the cytoplasm (1b). Strand separation is done by the AGO protein (2), where
  the passenger strand will be cleaved (3) and the guide strand will be selected by
  the RISC complex to follow as a template for alignment with the mRNA (4). This will
  then be cleaved, thereby silencing the target gene (5). Created with biorender.'
