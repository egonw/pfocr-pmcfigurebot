caption: 'HFD alters the lipid metabolism of murine lacrimal glands at transcriptomic
  and phenotypic levels. (A) The heatmap shows the differential expression levels
  of lipid metabolism-associated transcripts in the lacrimal glands of NC-1 and HFD
  mice (fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5, BH-adjusted P < 0.05), based on the RNA-Seq data
  at eight time points in a 24-hour cycle. The color bar indicates the scale for transcript
  expression from blue to yellow across eight time points, with the expression range
  normalized to ±3. (B) Annotation of differentially expressed lipid metabolism-associated
  transcripts from the KEGG database (Q < 0.05). The top 10 annotated pathways are
  shown. The dashed line represents Q = 0.05. (C) KEGG network diagram of differentially
  expressed lipid metabolism–associated transcripts. The circles represent transcripts.
  The color and size of the circles indicate the number of transcripts connected to
  each node. The darker the color and the larger the box, the more transcripts connected
  to the node. Differently colored lines represent different pathway classifications.
  The orange and yellow lines represent metabolic and organismal systems, respectively.
  (D–F) GSEA results showing the enrichment plots for glycerolipid metabolism (D),
  sphingolipid metabolism (E), and fatty acid transport (F) in the ELGs of NC-1 and
  HFD mice. NES, normalized enrichment score. (G) Diurnal oscillations of lipid droplet
  deposition in the immunohistochemistry images of ELG sections from NC-1, HFD, NC-2,
  and HF-NC mice at 6-hour intervals; n = 6 mice per group per time point (every 6
  hours). One-way ANOVA using Bonferroni correction: *significant difference between
  NC-1 and HFD groups; #significant difference between NC-2 and HF-NC groups; ζsignificant
  difference between HFD and HF-NC groups. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. Gray shading
  indicates dark phase. (H) Quantitative analysis of lipid droplet deposition using
  one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing; n = 24 mice per group.
  One-way ANOVA using Bonferroni correction: *significant difference between NC-1
  and HFD groups; #significant difference between NC-2 and HF-NC groups; ζsignificant
  difference between HFD and HF-NC groups. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant.
