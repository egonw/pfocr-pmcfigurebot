caption: Acacetin ameliorated spatial learning and memory impairment of AD mice in
  the MWM test. (a–d) Spatial acquisition trials with the hidden platform. (a) Path
  length to the hidden platform. (b) Escape latency to the hidden platform. (c) Percentage
  of total path length spent in the target quadrant. (d) Percentage of time spent
  in the target quadrant. Data are presented as mean ± SD. N = 6 mice in each group
  tested four times a day. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures
  ANOVA with LSD post hoc test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 in comparison with Day 1. (e
  and f) Probe trials with the absence of the platform. (e) Time spent in the target
  quadrant. (f) The number of platform crossings. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
  N = 6 mice in each group. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used.
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.
