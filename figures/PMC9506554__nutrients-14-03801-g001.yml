caption: 'The role of one-carbon metabolism in phosphatidylcholine synthesis through
  the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway. Key enzymes are
  underlined. BHMT: betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; MTHFD1: methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase; MTHFR: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; PEMT: phosphatidylethanolamine
  N-methyltransferase; SHMT1: serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1. * Denotes the domain
  of the MTHFD1 tri-functional enzyme containing the rs2235226 variant.'
