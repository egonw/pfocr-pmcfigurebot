caption: Pathway enrichment and pharmaco-connectivity analysis of the DEP signature.
  (a) Signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) of the DEP signature. Green nodes represent
  pathways that are activated (topology score > 0), and red nodes represent pathways
  that are inhibited (topology score < 0). (b) Significant positively connected perturbagens
  to the DEP signature, ranked by lowest p-value and highest Z-score. (c) Pharmaco-connectivity
  analysis between the positively connected perturbagens and the predicted targets
  of Galangin based on structural similarity.
