caption: 'Pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 rescued IR-induced GBM cachexia. (A,B)
  The protein expression of muscle protein synthesis (p-mTOR, p-AKT), muscle protein
  degradation (MuRF1, Atrogin-1) related proteins, upstream pathway (p-STAT3, STAT3),
  and PAI-1 protein in C2C12 myoblast cell, C2C12 differentiated myotube treated with
  U87MG exosome and TM5441, PAI-1 inhibitor in the short-term or long-term were assessed
  by western blot (left panel). p-STAT3, p-mTOR, p-AKT, MuRF1, Atrogin-1, PAI-1 protein
  were quantified (right panel). (C) Mouse body weights change in three groups of
  mice; U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus
  IR (2 Gy × 5) treated group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus IR (2 Gy × 5)
  plus TM5441 treated group. (left panel). The final body weights of the mice were
  measured (right panel). (D) Survival analysis of three groups of mice; U87MG-luciferase
  cell xenograft group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus IR (2 Gy × 5) treated
  group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus IR (2 Gy × 5) plus TM5441 treated group.
  Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
  test (E) Size of gastrocnemius fiber from three groups of mice; U87MG-luciferase
  cell xenograft group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus IR (2 Gy × 5) treated
  group, U87MG-luciferase cell xenograft plus IR (2 Gy × 5 plus TM5441 treated group.
  Scale bars, 100 µm (upper panel). Myofiber cross-sectional area size in gastrocnemius
  was measured by ImageJ (lower panel). (F) Protein levels of PAI-1, NeuN and PSD95
  (controlled by ponceau) were analyzed by western blot in xenografts serum (left
  panel). PAI-1 protein level was quantified (right panel). (G) Protein levels of
  PAI-1, CD9, CD63 and CD81 were analyzed by western blot in isolated exosomes from
  xenografts serum (left panel). PAI-1 protein level was quantified (right panel).
  (H) The protein expression of muscle protein synthesis (p-mTOR, p-AKT), muscle protein
  degradation (MuRF1, Atrogin-1) related proteins, upstream pathway (p-STAT3, STAT3),
  and PAI-1 protein in Xenografts gastrocnemius treated with IR or TM5441 were assessed
  by western blot (left panel). p-STAT3, p-mTOR, p-AKT, MuRF1, Atrogin-1, PAI-1 protein
  was quantified by imageJ (right panel). (I) Schematic diagram depicting that exosomal
  PAI-1 induces ionizing radiation-adaptive GBM cachexia by regulating the intracellular
  STAT3 pathway. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA plus Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test. ns: nonsignificant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.005, **** p < 0.0001.'
