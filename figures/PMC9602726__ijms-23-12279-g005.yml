caption: Analysis of protein−protein interaction network of the differentially expressed
  proteins. Functional interactions of the 165 DEPs were annotated by STRING database
  and visualized by Cytoscape software. (A) The total PPI network of the 165 DEPS.
  (B–E) were the simplified core PPI networks.
