caption: IL-12-related signaling pathway. IL-12 is unique in having the only heterodimeric
  cytokines, which are composed of an α-chain (p35) and a β-chain (p40). IL-12 signals
  via its receptor IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are mediated by members of the JAK-STAT family
  which mediate the expression of downstream proteins, such as IL-21, IL-17A, IL-23R,
  IL-18R, IL-2Rα, T-bet and IFN-γ.
