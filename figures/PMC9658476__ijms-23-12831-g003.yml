caption: Functional classification and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in P. mume. (a) Gene ontology (GO) classification of DEGs. The horizontal
  axis is the GO slim classification, and the vertical axis is the number of genes.
  (b) KEGG pathway classification of DEGs. The vertical axis is the name of the KEGG
  metabolic pathway, the horizontal axis is the ratio of the number of genes annotated
  to the pathway to the total number of annotated genes, and the value in the figure
  is the number of genes annotated to the pathway. (c) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs.
  The horizontal axis is the number of differentially expressed genes, and the vertical
  axis is the functional classification of GO. The color represents the q-value, and
  the smaller the q-value, the more significant it is. (d) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DEGs. The horizontal axis is the number of differentially expressed genes, the
  vertical axis is KEGG Pathway, the color represents q-value, and the smaller the
  q-value, the more significant the enrichment result is.
