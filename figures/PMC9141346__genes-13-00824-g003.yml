caption: 'GSEA analysis of nine representative significantly enriched gene sets in
  phenotype injured. Enrichment plots comparing injured toward normal phenotype were
  depicted with following sets of genes: (a) GOBP protein activation cascade; (b)
  GOBP complement activation; (c) GOBP antigen processing and presentation of peptide
  or polysaccharide antigen via MHC class II; (d) KEGG complement and coagulation
  cascades; (e) GOBP positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor production;
  (f) GOBP phagocytosis, engulfment; (g) GOBP chemokine-mediated signaling pathway;
  (h) GOBP cellular response to interferon-Î³ and (i) GOBP monocyte chemotaxis. Comparison
  of samples, NES, nominal p-value, and FDR q-value were determined by the GSEA software
  and were indicated within each enrichment plot.'
