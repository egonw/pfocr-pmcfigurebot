caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showing proteinâ€“protein interactions of
  some of the 251 differentially expressed molecules between osteopetrosis cells treated
  with fluconazole and untreated cells as well as healthy control cells. Highlighted
  in pink or red colors are some of the implicated proteins from this study, with
  their expression fold-changes and p values indicated below each protein. Central
  to the network is ERK 1/2, with direct (solid lines) and indirect (broken lines)
  interactions with other osteogenesis-implicated molecules like ATPase, Annexin and
  Calceneurin. Other proteins without expression values below them represent molecules
  from the IPA database that altogether make up the non-canonical network. The network
  analysis was generated using the IPA program. (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com,
