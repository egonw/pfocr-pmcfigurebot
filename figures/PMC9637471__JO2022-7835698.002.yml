caption: FRGs variations and associated pathways. (a, b). The correlation between
  CNV, methylation, and mRNA expression levels was represented, respectively. Red
  bubbles mean positive correlation, and blue means negative correlation. The darker
  the color means the larger the correlation coefficient. The size of the bubble means
  FDR. (c) Oncoplots of the somatic mutation displayed the frequency of 55 FRGs mutations
  in CC patients. (d) Mutations in 55 FRGs among CC patients. Asterisk shows p values
  (âˆ—p < 0.01, p < 0.05) (e) The thermogram showed the correlation of the expression
  of 55 FRGs in the pan-cancer signaling pathway. Pathway_a (red) indicates the percentage
  of cancers in which the pathway is likely activated by a particular gene, inhibition
  in a similar way shown as pathway_i (blue). (f) The network showed the relationship
  between FRGs and pathways. The solid lines indicate activation and the dashed lines
  indicate inhibition. (g) GO analysis revealed that many biological processes related
  to metabolism and oxidative stress were enriched. (h) KEGG analysis showed that
  the ferroptosis pathway and immune checkpoint pathways were enriched.
