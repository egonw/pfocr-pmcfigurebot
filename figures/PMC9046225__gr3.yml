caption: 'High CAR and ABCD2 scores associate with biological processes signifying
  plaque instabilitySee also  and .(A) Protein-protein interaction networks enriched
  among the significantly upregulated genes in plaques from high vs. low-risk CAR
  comparison.(B) Pathways induced in plaques from high-risk vs. low-risk patients
  in the CAR cohort were enriched for inflammation, foam cell differentiation, lipid
  transport, smooth muscle cell, endothelial cell migration, coagulation, and angiogenesis.
  Repressed pathways in the same comparison were enriched for extracellular matrix
  organization, fibroblast migration, exocytosis, and progenitor cell differentiation.(C)
  Similar analyses for PBMCs revealed induction of several pathways involving platelets
  and inflammation, as well as regulation of wound healing. Among the repressed pathways
  in PBMCs, protein phosphorylation and cell-cycle regulation were observed.(D) Protein-protein
  interaction networks enriched among significantly upregulated genes in plaques from
  high-risk vs. low-risk ABCD2 comparison.(E) In plaques from high-risk vs. low-risk
  patients in the ABCD2 cohort the top enriched pathway was neutrophil mediated immunity,
  in addition to pathways coupled to foam cell differentiation, cholesterol transport,
  and coagulation, whereas positive regulation of mineralization/ossification, chondrocyte
  differentiation, smooth muscle cell migration, and extracellular matrix organization
  were all repressed.(F) Similar analyses in PBMCs coupled high-risk to enriched inflammation,
  apoptosis, and intracellular signal transduction. Interestingly, among repressed
  pathways in PBMCs, IL-6 and VEGF signaling were found, in addition to regulation
  of cell proliferation and vesicle-mediated transport. Number of samples used in
  CAR analyses: plaques n = 58, PBMCs n = 44. Number of samples used in ABCD2 analyses:
  plaques n = 30, PBMCs n = 22.'
