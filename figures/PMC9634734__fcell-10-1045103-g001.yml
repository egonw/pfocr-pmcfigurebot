caption: 'BMP4 signaling pathways and itsâ€™ regulatory mechanisms in stem cell differentiation:
  (A) Activation of smad-dependent pathway is initiated when BMP4 dimer binds to BMPR1/2
  complex. This interaction activates the phosphorylation of receptor-associated SMADs
  (SMAD 1/5/8) by BMPR1 to produce R-smads. R-smads then recruit SMAD4 to form Co-smad
  and translocate into the nucleus leading to downstream signaling. (B) In smad-independent
  pathway, BMPR1 activates MAP kinase and acts as transcription factors inside the
  nucleus. Both pathways induce cell commitment and differentiation. (C) BMP4 signaling
  pathways are regulated by intracellular and extracellular antagonist molecules.
  Extracellular BMP antagonist (noggin, chordin, follistatin, gremlin and BAMBI) binds
  to BMP4 dimer ligand and prevent the interaction of BMP4 ligand with its BMP receptors
  leading to no activation of smad-dependent pathway. On the other hand, intracellular
  BMP antagonist, known as inhibitory smad (I-smad), shutdown the activated smad-dependent
  pathway by preventing the phosphorylation of r-smads and block the interaction between
  R-smads with Co-smads. This schematic was created with BioRender.com.'
