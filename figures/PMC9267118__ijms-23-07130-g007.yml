caption: The TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 suppressed reductions in TNF-R1 protein levels
  by cucurbitacin B. (A,B) A549 cells were pretreated with (+) or without (−) bafilomycin
  A1, TAPI-2, or MG-132 for 1 h and then with (+) or without (−) cucurbitacin B (10
  µM) for 1 h in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (100 nM), TAPI-2 (25 µM), or MG-132
  (20 µM), followed by the preparation of whole cell lysates. TNF-R1 was detected
  by the anti-TNF-R1 antibody C25C1. Blots are representative of four independent
  experiments. The amount of TNF-R1 was normalized to that of GAPDH. TNF-R1 protein
  (%) is shown as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
