caption: HERC3 interacts with ERK2 and promotes in the Z734–mediated ubiquitination
  of ERK2. (A) MCF–7 cells were treated with MG132 (10 mM) and Z734 (10 μM) for 12
  h. (B) Total lysates from MCF–7 cells expressing Myc–HERC3 in the presence of Flag–ERK2
  were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti–Myc followed by Western blotting
  using the indicated antibodies. (C) Total lysates from MCF–7 cells expressing Flag–ERK2
  in the presence of Myc–HERC3 were subjected to IP with anti–Flag followed by Western
  blotting using the indicated antibodies. (D) The interaction between endogenous
  ERK2 and HERC3 was analyzed via co–immunoprecipitation. IP samples and whole–cell
  lysates were analyzed via Western blotting. IgG served as the negative control.
  (E) The indicated purified GST–HERC3 protein was mixed with purified Flag–ERK2 protein.
  GST pulldown analyses were conducted. (F–I) Schematic representations of wild–type
  and deletion mutants of ERK2 (F) and HERC3 (H) are shown by describing each functional
  motif and numbers corresponding to the amino acid residues. The associations between
  various truncation mutants of ERK2 (G) and HERC3 interaction–defective mutants (I)
  were detected using the indicated IP and IB analyses. aa, amino acids. (J) MCF–7
  cells were treated with MG132 (10 mM) and Z734 (10 μM) for 12 h. (K) MCF–7 cells
  were transfected with Flag–ERK2, Myc–HERC3, and wild–type (WT) or mutant ubiquitin
  (K48O) as indicated. The poly–ubiquitination of ERK2 was examined via Western blotting
  using an anti–ubiquitin antibody.
