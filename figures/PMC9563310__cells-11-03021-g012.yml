caption: Aging hLECs displayed a significant loss in Bmal1/E-Box or Nrf2/ARE binding
  and was revived by Metformin. (A) Schematic illustration of Prdx6 gene promoter
  containing Bmal1/E-Box and Nrf2/ARE sites with sequences and position as well as
  primer location and sequences. (B–D) In vivo DNA-binding assay, ChIP assay revealed
  that Metformin revived binding activity of Bmal1 and Nrf2 to their corresponding
  sites in the Prdx6 promoter in aging hLECs. ChIP was conducted with antibodies specific
  to Bmal1 (B), Nrf2 (C), and nonspecific IgG control (D). Immunoprecipitated DNA
  fragments isolated from different ages of primary hLECs were purified and processed
  for RT-qPCR analyses using primers shown in Figure. Histograms represent loss of
  Bmal1 enrichment (B; orange bars) at E-Box and Nrf2 (C; orange bars) at ARE site,
  and the sites which was restored by Metformin (B and C; orange vs. blue bars) treatment
  as shown. ChIP with IgG control (D) antibody was used as negative control. The data
  represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Vehicle control (orange
  bars) vs. Metformin-treated (blue bars) and young (19 y) vs. aged (53 y and 76 y)
  subjects; ** p < 0.001.
