caption: Immunofluorescence staining of ZO-1 on a high-density monolayer of HCEC-1CT
  incubated for 24 h with toxins alone (AOH 10 μM, ATX-II 1 μM, combi = binary mixture)
  or concomitantly with IL-1β stimulus. ZO-1 distribution between the perinuclear
  and cytosolic regions was calculated as a ratio and normalized to the respective
  control conditions (A + B). (C + D) panels show Ocln staining for the respective
  conditions. Mean values of CTCF for chosen ROIs of at least four biological replicates
  and technical triplicates were normalized to the controls. Significant differences
  between the respective controls were calculated by applying the Student’s t-test
  at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001. § (p < 0.05) and §§ (p < 0.01) mark significant differences
  of IL-1β stimulated exposure conditions against the solvent control (no stimulus).
