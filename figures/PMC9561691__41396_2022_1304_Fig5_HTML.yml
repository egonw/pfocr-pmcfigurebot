figure_title: Relative abundance of marine bacteria with varying biotin biosynthesis
  potential in the Atlantic Ocean
caption: A Depicted are gene presence for subdivision into biotin biosynthetic phenotypes
  (biotin auxotroph = gray, desthiobiotin auxotroph = yellow and biotin prototroph = orange)
  as presented in B. Map depicting 22 stations (black dots) from 62 °S in the Southern
  Ocean to 47 °N in the North Atlantic, sampled at 20 m depth during a cruise with
  RV Polarstern. The relative abundance of marine bacteria encoding the last four
  enzymatic biotin biosynthesis genes (biotin prototroph; orange), bacteria lacking
  the complete biotin pathway but encoding at least bioB (desthiobiotin auxotroph;
  yellow) and bacteria lacking the biotin biosynthesis pathway genes (biotin auxotroph,
  gray) is shown in the pie charts of the individual sampling stations. The percentage
  indicated in each pie chart represents the proportion of genome-sequenced prokaryotes
  in which the biotin biosynthetic potential of the entire prokaryotic community (identified
  by the 16 S rRNA gene) was detected. Annual surface chlorophyll a concentrations
  (mg m−3) are shown in a green color spectrum.
