caption: Identification of 3′ UTR of NHE1 mRNA as a possible target of miRNAs. (a)
  K562 cells transfected with pGL3-SLC9A1 showed lower relative luciferase activity
  than cells transfected with pGL3-control. This result was in according with what
  was found by introducing another luciferase report assay psiCHECK-2 vector constructed
  with the same sequence. (b) A schematic diagram of the putative seed regions in
  the 3′ UTR of NHE1. Highly conserved regions among vertebrates were shown in the
  diagram. By analyzing the sequence of 3′ UTR in silico, NHE1 was computationally
  predicted to be a target of multiple miRNAs, including hsa-miR-19. (c) The mutation
  of miR-19 binding site could increase activity of 3′ UTR, and the same trend was
  found by using miR-19 inhibitor. (d, e) Activity of SLC9A1 promoter and 3′ UTR responded
  to signaling inhibitors in K562 cells. (f) NHE1 expression at mRNA level was detected
  in K562 cells with indicated treatments. (g–i) NHE1 expression at protein level
  was detected in K562 cells with indicated treatments. (j) The pHi value in K562
  cells with indicated treatments was detected. Data was shown as mean ± s.e.m. of
  triplicate assays. ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
