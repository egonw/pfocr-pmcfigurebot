caption: The expressions of CTK- and ABA-signaling genes induced by TDZ at different
  temperatures. (A) Numbers of DEGs; (B) heatmap of CTK-signaling genes generated
  based on the RNA-seq data; (C) heatmap of ABA-signaling genes generated based on
  the RNA-seq data. TDZ-induced downregulated and upregulated expressions are indicated
  by blue and red colors, respectively. The number in the box indicates the fold-change
  expression of the gene (only those with a â‰¥one-fold difference are shown). All the
  numbers in the heatmap represent fold changes.
