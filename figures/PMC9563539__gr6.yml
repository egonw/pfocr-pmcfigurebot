caption: 'Comparison of the ligand-mediated pathway activation between the two CCA
  subgroups(A) Experimental workflow for determining the ligand-mediated pathway activation.
  Cell lines were exposed to 100 ng/mL of EGF, IGF1, Anisomycin, TNFα, and IFNγ for
  10, 30, and 60 min. Phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, S6K, and STAT1 and the nuclear
  translocation of the RelA (the p65 subunit of NF-κB) were measured. Temporal responses
  were then converted to AUC for quantifying the activity of each pathway.(B) Principal
  component analysis of the ligand-mediated activity of pERK, pS6K, pSTAT1, pAKT,
  and RelA. Loadings of ligand responses (left) and the PC1 and PC2 scores were compared
  between the CCA1 (cyan) and CCA2 cell lines (orange) (right).(C) Analysis of the
  association between CCA subgroups and signal activation. The odds ratio (probability
  of being CCA1 over the probability of being CCA2) was calculated using the log of
  the coefficient derived from the generalized linear model used to assess the relationship
  between CCA subtypes (CCA1 or CCA2) and ligand-mediated activation of key proteins
  (pERK, pS6K, pSTAT1, pAKT, or RelA). A p-value < 0.05 indicates that significant
  ligand-activated signaling pathway. Error bars represent the interquartile range
  of the odds ratio.(D) Comparison of ligand-specific pathway activity between the
  two CCA subgroups. Data between two subgroups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank
  sum test. Boxes range from the first to the third quartile, while lines inside the
  box mark medians. Upper and lower points mark the position of outliers.(E) Association
  of the mutation status and the ligand-mediated pathway activity bias. The average
  difference of protein activity between the mutated and the wild-type cell lines
  (x-axis) was plotted against the significant score (y-axis: –log10(p-value) from
  the Wilcoxon rank sum test; showing only those with p-value < 0.05). The bubble
  size represents the number of mutated cell lines. Significant mutations observed
  in both CCA subgroups are displayed in pink, while the CCA1-specific or CCA2-specific
  mutations are shown in cyan and orange, respectively.(F) Example mutation-associated
  pathway activity bias for common (KRAS and TP53), CCA1-specific (ERBB2 and FLT3),
  and CCA2-specific (PIK3C2B and PTEN) mutations. The mutation-associated activity
  bias for ERK and AKT pathways was shown across all ligands and compared between
  the two CCA subgroups. See also E for similar results of other signaling proteins.(G)
  Summary network diagrams of the mutation-associated pathway activity bias of CCA1
  and CCA2 subgroups. Nodes represent mutated genes (top panel), ligands (middle panel),
  and signaling proteins (bottom panel). Each edge represents the identified mutation-ligand-protein
  association group. The edge color highlights the direction of the activity bias
  (red: mutant> wild-type vs. blue: mutant< wild-type), and the edge size shows the
  significance score of the association.'
