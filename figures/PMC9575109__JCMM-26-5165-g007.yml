caption: RNA‐sequence analysis of miRNAs from plasma exosomes. (A) Heatmap of 43 differentially
  expressed miRNAs. (B) Volcano map illustrating differentially expressed miRNAs;
  bubbles in upper left quadrant and upper right quadrant represent down‐regulated
  and up‐regulated miRNAs, respectively. (C) Clinical plasma samples were collected,
  and the expression level of miR‐4532 in different groups determined by qRT‐PCR.
  (D, E) KEGG pathway and GO analysis of mi‐4532 predicted target genes. *p < 0.05
  and **p < 0.01
article_title: Macrophage‐derived exosomal miR‐4532 promotes endothelial cells injury
  by targeting SP1 and NF‐κB P65 signalling activation.
