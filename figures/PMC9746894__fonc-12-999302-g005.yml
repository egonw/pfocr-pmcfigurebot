caption: The interaction between TBL1XR1 and SMC3. (A) Distribution of IP-MS intensity
  of the two replicates. (B) Pathway analysis of IP-MS signals. (C, D) Co-IP validation
  of interaction between TBL1XR1 and SMC3 in 22RV1 (C) and 293T (D) cells. (E) SMC3
  protein levels in 22RV1 and TBL1XR1-deficient cells after 0h, 1h, 2h and 4h treatment
  of 10μM olaparib. (F) Nuclear soluble and chromatin-bound SMC3 protein levels in
  22RV1 and TBL1XR1-deficient cells under vehicle or olaparib treatment for 4h. The
  values of SMC3 protein levels are normalized to SP1 (nuclear soluble) or histone
  H3 (chromatin-bound) and compared to WT without treatment.
