caption: Expression pattern of the endogenous SSS protein in Drosophila. (A) Strategy
  for the construction of Drosophila endogenous sss‐GFP knock‐in line with the CRISPR/Cas9
  system. (B and C) Immunofluorescence images of sss‐GFP (green) expression pattern
  in fly brain. SSS is expressed in MB (bracket and white arrowhead), SP, and VPN
  (white arrow). (D) sss relative mRNA expression between the heads and guts of wild‐type
  flies. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. (E) Immunofluorescence
  images of the expression pattern of SSS (green) in the whole gut. Prospero staining
  (magenta) identifies EEs. Scale bar = 200 μm. (F and G) Representative images showing
  the expression of sss‐GFP (green) in various types of cells in the Drosophila intestine.
  Scale bar = 25 μm. The right image is a partial enlargement of the left panel. The
  upper part shows the Dl (red) staining, and the lower shows the GFP (green) staining.
  White arrows indicate ISCs (Dl+), yellow arrows indicate EEs (Pros+), and yellow
  arrowheads indicate ECs (large and polyploid). Scale bar = 10 μm. DAPI‐stained nuclei
  are shown in blue. Student's t test, ****p < 0.0001.
