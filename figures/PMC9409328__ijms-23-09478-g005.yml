caption: Lipid synthesis was examined by Oil Red O staining at day 4 after treatment
  with forskolin, salbutamol, and timolol. HMGECs were cultured with or without forskolin,
  salbutamol, and timolol, and lipid accumulation was assessed using Oil Red O staining
  on day 4. The results of three experiments are summarized in the right panels. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean; * p < 0.05.
