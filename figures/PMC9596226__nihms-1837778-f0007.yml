figure_title: srGAP1low cells have increased Smad2 activation and TGF-β2 secretion
caption: '(A) Left: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis; right: reactome pathway analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in srGAP1 KD #1 MDA-MB-231 tumors in relation
  to Ctrl tumors, *padj < 0.05.(B) Top: immunoblot of Smad2 in Ctrl and srGAP1 KD
  #1 MDA-MB-231 cells using an anti-Smad2/3 antibody. Loading control, anti-β-actin.
  Bottom: densitometry analysis of Smad2 protein levels in Ctrl and KD #1 cells, three
  biological replicates.(C) Immunofluorescence of Smad2/3 in Ctrl and srGAP1 KD #1
  MDA-MB-231 cells. Left: Smad2/3. Middle: phalloidin staining for F-actin. Right:
  DAPI for nuclear staining. Scale bar, 10 μm.(D) Smad2/3 nuclear intensity per cell.
  Left: n = 170 (Ctrl), 171 (srGAP1 KD #1) MDA-MB-231 cells. Right: n = 151 (Ctrl)
  cells, n = 169 (srGAP1 KD #2) MDA-MB-231 cells. Data over three independent experiments,
  Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed. Data represented as a violin plot; horizontal lines
  are median and interquartile range.(E) pSmad2/total Smad2 nuclear intensity ratio.
  Left: n = 90 (Ctrl), 94 (srGAP1 KD #1) MDA-MB-231 cells. Right: n = 80 (Ctrl), 99
  (srGAP1 KD #2) MDA-MB-231 cells. Data over three independent experiments, Mann-Whitney
  U test, two-tailed. Data represented as a violin plot; horizontal lines are median
  and interquartile range.(F) Differential expression of proteins from secretome analysis
  of conditioned medium from srGAP1 KD #1 MDA-MB-231 cells in relation to conditioned
  medium from Ctrl cells. Data visualized as a Venn diagram, three biological replicates
  and two technical duplicates.(G) Pathway enrichment analysis of secretome (proteomics
  of conditioned medium) from srGAP1 KD #1 MDA-MB-231 cells in relation to conditioned
  medium from Ctrl cells.(H) Expression of TGF-β ligands from proteomics data comparing
  conditioned medium from Ctrl and srGAP1 KD #1 MDA-MB-231 cells. Each data point
  is a biological replicate (averaged technical duplicates).(I) Matrix degradation
  of MDA-MB-231 Ctrl cells plated on gelatin and stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β2,
  16 h. Left: cortactin. Middle: phalloidin stain for F-actin. Right: fluorescent
  gelatin matrix. Scale bar, 10 μm.(J) Matrix degradation of MDA-MB-231 Ctrl cells
  stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β2 plated on gelatin, 16 h. Data from three independent
  experiments and represented as a violin plot, horizontal lines are median and interquartile
  range. n = 41 (Ctrl), 42 (TGF-β2-stimulated) fields quantified. Mann-Whitney U test,
  two-tailed.(K) Nuclear p27 staining intensity of MDA-MB-231 Ctrl and srGAP1 KD #2
  primary tumors. Top: p27. Bottom: DAPI for nuclei. Scale bar, 10 μm.(L) Nuclear
  p27 staining intensity of MDA-MB-231 primary tumors. Top: data pooled over two Ctrl
  and two srGAP1 KD #1 mice. n = 39 (Ctrl) cells, n = 48 (srGAP1 KD #1) cells. Two
  246 × 246 μm sections quantified per mouse. Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed. Bottom:
  data pooled over two Ctrl and two srGAP1 KD #2 mice. One 388 × 388 μm section quantified
  per mouse. n = 38 (Ctrl) cells, n = 46 (srGAP1 KD #2) cells. Mann-Whitney U test,
  two-tailed. Data represented as a violin plot; horizontal lines are median and interquartile
  range.'
