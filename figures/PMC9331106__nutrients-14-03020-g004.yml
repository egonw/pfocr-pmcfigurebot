caption: 'Intracellular alanine isotopologue distribution in MDA-MB-231 NQO1+ (Panel
  (A)), MDA-MB-231 NQO1− (Panel (B)), T47D (Panel (C)), and MDA-MB-468 (Panel (D)).
  Alanine MID reflects treatment effects on a branching pathway of glycolysis. (Note:
  n = 3, biological replicate data are represented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance
  was determined by ANOVA and student’s t-test post hoc analysis and is presented
  as: (*) if p ≤ 0.05, (**) if p ≤ 0.01, and (***) if p ≤ 0.001 compared to control.
  (γ) if p ≤ 0.001 compared to β-lap treatment. (c) if p ≤ 0.001 compared to AOA treatment).'
