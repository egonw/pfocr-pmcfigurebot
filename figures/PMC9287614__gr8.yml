caption: 'Antioxidant enzymes in human skeletal muscle in response to incremental
  exercise to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia, and post-exercise ischaemia.
  Levels of protein expression of (A) GR, (B) Trx1, (C) Gpx1 and (D) TrxR1. Nx: normoxia
  session (FIO2 = 0.21, PIO2 = 143 mmHg); Hyp: severe normobaric hypoxia session (FIO2 = 0.104,
  PIO2 = 73 mmHg); Pre: before exercise; Post: 10 s after exercise cessation during
  ischaemic recovery; Oc1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during ischaemic recovery;
  FC1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during recovery with free circulation. For panel
  (A), n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9) and Post Hyp (n = 10)
  and for panels (B), (C) and (D), n = 11 except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9). See  for a detailed
  description of the experimental phases. The statistical analysis was performed with
  logarithmically transformed data for GR. Values presented are means ± standard errors
  and expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.). †p < 0.05 vs. Pre Nx; *p < 0.05 vs. Pre
  Hyp; #p < 0.05 vs. Post Hyp.'
