figure_title: Transcriptomic profiling of post-apalutamide samples and effects of
  apalutamide treatment on androgen receptor activity
caption: A Gene expression differences between biochemical responders and non-responders
  for several AR signalling pathway genes. P-values were obtained from Wilcoxon rank-sum
  tests. B Gene-set enrichment analysis between biochemical non-responders relative
  to responders showed an increase in MYC target pathways and androgen response, while
  immune pathways were downregulated in non-responders after treatment by apalutamide.
  C Log2 fold change between post-apalutamide and pre-treatment samples for genes
  involved in AR activity. Samples are split by biochemical response and ordered by
  baseline AR activity. Log2 fold change are shown from blue to red as indicated by
  the colour bar. D There is an overall decrease in AR activity after apalutamide,
  and non-responders had significantly less pronounced decrease in AR activity. P-value
  was from Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the differences in normalised AR activity
  after treatment between non-responders and responders.
