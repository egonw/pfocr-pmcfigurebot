caption: Primary pathways of phage replication (top) and transduction (bottom). (A)
  The lytic and lysogenic pathways of phage replication are shown. The first step
  in both pathways involves the attachment of phage receptor binding proteins to specific
  receptor(s) on the host cell surface and subsequent ejection of phage DNA (cyan).
  Obligately lytic/virulent phages are obliged to follow the lytic life cycle, in
  which phage DNA and proteins are replicated and synthesized, respectively (rolling-circle
  DNA replication is shown as an example). The DNA is packaged, phage particles are
  assembled, and the host cell is finally lysed to allow for phage escape. Lysogenic/temperate
  phages have the capacity to choose whether to enter into the lytic cycle or lysogenic
  cycle following DNA ejection. During the lysogenic cycle, the phage genome is integrated
  into the host chromosome (magenta), at which point the phage becomes a prophage,
  and the cell becomes a lysogen. The prophage genome is then replicated passively
  along with the host genome, until a stressor or other environmental signal triggers
  phage entry into the lytic cycle, a process known as induction. Inset shows the
  morphologies of the most commonly-encountered phages--myovirus (left), podovirus
  (center), and siphovirus (right). (B) The three major pathways of transduction are
  shown using a lysogenic staphylococcal phage as an example. Following prophage induction,
  the phage packaging (pac) site (black triangle) serves as a primary recognition
  sequence for the phage packaging machinery and enables the high-frequency production
  of infective lytic particles containing phage genomes (cyan). During generalized
  transduction (left), the occasional packaging of host-derived DNA bearing pac site
  homologs (pseudo-pac sites, green triangles) results in the infrequent production
  of transducing particles containing host-derived DNA (magenta). During specialized
  transduction (middle pathway), imprecise excision of the prophage genome leads to
  packaging of a DNA hybrid containing the phage genome along with host genes adjacent
  to the phage integration site. Lateral transduction (right) occurs in specific staphylococcal
  prophages in which DNA replication begins prior to excisionâ€”this process results
  in the high frequency packaging of both phage DNA and host DNA encoded hundreds
  of kilobases from the prophage integration site. (C) The pathway for SaPI (Staphylococcus
  aureus Pathogenicity Island) transduction is shown. Upon induction of the helper
  prophage (cyan), both prophage and SaPI (green) excise and replicate. A SaPI-specific
  packaging site (orange triangle) directs the high frequency packaging of SaPI DNA
  into transducing particles composed of phage structural proteins. Some SaPIs encode
  proteins that alter the capsid architecture, resulting in the production of transducing
  particles with unusually small capsids.
