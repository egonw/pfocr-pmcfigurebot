caption: Inhibiting NOTCH1 singaling impaired M2 macrophages-mediated cell proliferation
  and invasion. (A) Bioluminescence assays showed that inhibiting NOTCH signalling
  impaired M2 macrophage direct contact-mediated DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cell proliferation.
  (B) Matrigel-based Transwell invasion assays showed that γ-secretase inhibition
  in NOTCH1-depleted DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells abolished M2 macrophages direct
  contact-mediated cell invasive ability. (C) Western blot assay showed that inhibiting
  γ-secretase activity significantly reduced N1ICD, N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail
  expression in NOTCH1-depleted DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
