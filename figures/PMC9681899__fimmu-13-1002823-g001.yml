caption: ZC3H11A is a regulator of innate immune signaling. Volcano plot analysis
  of the cellular mRNA expression profile in unstimulated (A) and IL-1b stimulated
  (B) HeLa cells transfected with a ZC3H11A (siZC3) or a scrambled negative control
  (siNEG) siRNA. Data points represent the log2 fold-changes of the triplicate experiments
  (n = 3 per group). Blue, down-regulated (Padj<0.05); grey, non-regulated; red, upregulated
  (Padj<0.05) mRNAs. (C-F) Gene set enrichment analysis of ranked DE genes in ZC3-KD
  cells using hallmark gene sets. (G) Heatmap of the genes contributing to TNF-a signalling
  via NF-kB pathway.
