caption: 'POL repaired the M. furfur-stimulated skin injury via STAT3 phosphorylated
  activation. (A) Western blot analysis of the expression of the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway-related proteins and their quantitation in the M. furfur-stimulated mouse
  skin (E-roller: Electric frosting roller; Model: electric frosting roller and M.
  furfur; PJ: Polygala japonica Houtt.; POL-L: low-dose POL; POL-H: high-dose POL),
  GAPDH was used as the endogenous control, (B) the intensities of Western blots were
  measured by ImageJ software, n = 3, mean Â± SD, # p < 0.05, ### p < 0.001, vs. Normal
  group. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, vs. Model group. (C) Potential signaling pathway
  of POL, POL would accelerate repair of the M. furfur-stimulated skin injury via
  STAT3 phosphorylated activation independent of JAK and associated with immune response.'
