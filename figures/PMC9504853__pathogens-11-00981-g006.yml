caption: Rv2387 blocked the activation of the p38 and JNK pathway via TLR2 signaling.
  Murine RAW-Vec and RAW-Rv2387 macrophages were treated with TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4
  ((A), 200 ng/mL) and TLR4 agonist LPS ((B), 100 ng/mL) at different time points.
  (C) THP-1 macrophages were infected with engineered Msmg-2387 or Msmg-EV strains
  (MOI = 10) for the indicated time. Infected macrophages were lysed in RIPA buffer
  and then subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect the protein expression of phosphorylated
  or total Erk1/2, JNK, p38, MyD88, and IRAK4. Similar results were obtained in two
  or more independent experiments.
