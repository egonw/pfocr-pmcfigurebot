figure_title: Synthetic energy system enhances FFA production
caption: a, Schematic illustration of the twin engine for FFA production. b, The synthetic
  energy system can replace the TCA cycle to support cell growth. c, The synthetic
  energy system can replace the TCA cycle to support FFA production. d, Increased
  decarboxylation benefits FFA production. e, The NOG pathway, in concert with the
  synthetic energy system, increased FFA production. a–e, Statistical analysis was
  conducted using Student’s t-test (two-tailed, two-sample unequal variance, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; sample size, n = 3). At least two independent measurements
  were performed for each experiment, and the mean ± s.d. of three biological replicates
  of a representative measurement is shown. All cells were grown as described in experimental
  procedures. f, Fed-batch fermentation of strain SynENG058 under glucose-limited
  and nitrogen-restricted conditions. The plots include both batch and fed-batch data.
  Centre and error bars represent mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biologically independent samples).
