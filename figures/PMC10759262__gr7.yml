caption: 'Oridonin (ORI) ameliorates the lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in vitro
  by increasing the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and ethanolamine
  phosphotransferase 1 (EPT1) through LXRα. (A) Disease ontology (DO) analysis of
  the differential genes identified by RNA-seq revealed that ORI was associated with
  cancer therapy and lipid metabolism(GSE112908). (B) Venn diagram showing the number
  of differential genes in the lipid metabolism related pathway, and LXRα was collected
  and located in the overlap. (C) LXRα, ATGL and EPT1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells treated
  with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ORI (n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation (SD). ∗P < 0.05 was compared with DMSO group. (D, E) LXRα, ATGL and EPT1
  protein levels in HepG2 cells treated with DMSO or ORI (n = 3). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 were compared with DMSO group. (F, G) LXRα
  induced ATGL and EPT1 transcription with ORI or GW3965 treatment in luciferase reporter
  assays. HepG2 cells and 293T cells were transfected with LXRα plasmid and ATGL-luciferase
  reporter or EPT1-luciferase reporter. After 24 h transfection, 10 μM ORI or 10 μM
  GW3965 was administrated and then luciferase reporter activities were measured (n
  = 4). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. (H) Images and quantitation
  of ORO staining (n = 3). The oil red O (ORO) staining area was quantified in the
  insert chart. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ##P < 0.01 was compared with control
  group; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 were compared with oleic acid (OA) + palmitic acid
  (PA) group. (I) Triglyceride (TG) contents in HepG2 cells in the indicated groups
  simulated with OA and PA for 48 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5). ##P
  < 0.01 was compared with control group; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 were compared with
  OA + PA group. (J) The neutral lipid location nile red (NR) staining and apoptotic
  nuclei morphology changes (DAPI staining) in HepG2 cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. (K,
  L) Normalized nile red (NR) fluorescence intensity (K) and cell viability (L) in
  HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of ORI, which was co-treated with
  DMSO and GW3965. Data are mean ± SD (n = 5). #P<0.05 indicates a significant difference
  between control group and OA+PA group. ∗P < 0.05 indicates a significant difference
  between the ORI group and the ORI + GW3965 group.'
