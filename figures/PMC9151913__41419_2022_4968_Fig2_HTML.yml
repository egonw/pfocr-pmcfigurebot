figure_title: Downregulation of GBA1 promotes metastasis of liver cancer in vitro
  and in vivo
caption: A, B Confirmation of GBA1 overexpression in MHCC-97H cells and knockdown
  in HepG2 liver cancer cell lines. C, D The effects of GBA1 gain- or loss-of-function
  on the proliferation of MHCC-97H and HepG2 cells in vitro. The relative cell growth
  is shown as an OD value. E, G The effect of GBA1 gain-of-function on the migration
  and invasion of MHCC-97H cells. Representative images of the cells described in
  E (left) and G (left), and the relative number of migrated and invaded cells are
  shown as the number of migrated cells per field in E (right) and invaded cells in
  G (right). F, H The effect of GBA1 loss-of-function on the migration and invasion
  of HepG2 cells. Representative images are shown in F (left) and H (left), and the
  relative number of migrated and invaded cell numbers is shown as the number of migrated
  cells per field in F (right) and invaded cells in H (right). I The effect of GBA1
  gain-of-function on tumour volume in the orthotopic xenograft model (top). The data
  are shown as the means ± SD (n = 4). The effect of GBA1 gain-of-function on the
  proportion of normal liver tissue in the orthotopic xenograft model. The data are
  shown as the percentage of normal liver tissue compared with the whole liver after
  treatment (down, n = 4). Significance was determined by chi-square test. J, K The
  effect of GBA1 gain-of-function on spontaneous lung metastasis in the orthotopic
  xenograft model. Representative images of lung metastatic lesions as indicate by
  H&E staining are shown (J), and the average number of lung metastatic lesions in
  the four mice in each group is shown as the means ± SD (K). Significance was determined
  by Student’s t test. The arrow indicates the metastatic lung lesions. L The effect
  of GBA1 loss-of-function on the tumour volume in the orthotopic xenograft model
  (top) and the effect of GBA1 loss-of-function on liver cancer formation in the orthotopic
  xenograft model. The data are shown as the percentage of liver with cancer (bottom)
  (n = 4). Significance was determined by Fisher’s exact probability test. M, N The
  effect of GBA1 loss-of-function on spontaneous lung metastasis in the orthotopic
  xenograft model. Representative images of metastatic lung lesions as indicated by
  haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining are shown (M), and the average number of metastatic
  lung lesions in the four mice in each group is shown as the mean ± SD (N). Significance
  was determined by Student’s t test, and arrows indicate metastatic lung lesions.
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ***p < 0.001; ns, not significant. Scale bar, 50 μm (upper
  images in J and M), Scale bar, 100 μm (lower images in J, M).
