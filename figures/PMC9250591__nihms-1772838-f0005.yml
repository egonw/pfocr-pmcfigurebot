figure_title: Ptch1 and Hhip are expressed in Gli-negative cells in FILIF
caption: '(A-A’) H&E staining of filiform papillae (FILIF) in sagittal sections. Yellow
  dotted lines indicate location of Hhip in FILIF (A). FILIF-specific compartments
  are labeled (A’). Dotted lines demarcate anterior and posterior columns. Anterior
  column includes granular cell layers with keratohyalin granules. Between the FILIF
  is the inter-papilla buttress column. The FILIF are covered by thick cornified layers.
  (B) H&E: A restricted and distinctive pattern of Hhip in the anterior epithelial
  face of FILIF is illustrated (yellow dotted lines) based on the expression of gene
  and protein. Blue dotted lines demarcate the anterior and posterior FILIF columns.
  (B’) X-Gal: X-Gal staining (blue) from HhiplacZ/+ tongue reveals expression in a
  subset of FILIF cells (outlined in yellow). Nuclear fast red is used to label all
  cells. (B’’) HHIP/DAPI: Immunostaining of HHIP (red) demonstrates an expression
  pattern and location that directly correspond to Hhip. DAPI stains cell nuclei.
  (C-F) X-Gal staining of FILIF from Gli1lacZ/+, Gli2lacZ/+, Ptch1lacZ/+ and HhiplacZ/+
  reporter mice. (C) Gli1lacZ cells are not detected in FILIF. (D) Gli2lacZ cells
  are present in the basal layer of FILIF epithelium. Both Ptch1lacZ (E) and HhiplacZ
  (F) are observed in a subset of FILIF cells. (G-G’’) X-Gal staining in Ptch1lacZ
  tongue followed by HHIP immunostaining (red, G’) reveals overlapping expression
  of Ptch1 and HHIP outlined with yellow dots (G’,G’’). Asterisks denote non-specific
  antibody staining after X-Gal reactions in G’. Black/white dotted lines outline
  the epithelium in all the images in B-G’’.'
