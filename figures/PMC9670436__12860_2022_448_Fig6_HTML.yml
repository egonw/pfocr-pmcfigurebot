caption: The knockdown of RPL5 arrests the colon cancer cell cycle in G0/G1 phase.
  A Flow cytometry showed that knockdown of RPL5 increased the proportion of colon
  cancer cells in G0/G1 phase. B The levels of G0/G1 phase related proteins CDK4 and
  CyclinD1 were detected by western blotting. The band intensities of CDK4 and CyclinD1
  protein were quantified relative to Î²-Tubulin and normalized to the siNC sample.
  The blots were cut prior to hybridization with antibodies during blotting. The data
  are representative of three independent experiments
