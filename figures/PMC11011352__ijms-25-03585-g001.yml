caption: LIN28 Inhibits let-7 miRNA Biogenesis and Contributes to Cancer. In the nucleus,
  human LIN28B sequesters pri-let-7 and as a result, the Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor
  fails to generate pre-let-7, thereby arresting let-7 biogenesis. LIN28A (CSD—cold-shock
  domain; ZKD—zinc knuckle domain) binds to pre-let-7 after its nuclear export. Given
  the cytoplasmic localization of LIN28B in some cell types, LIN28B inhibition of
  mature let-7 biogenesis can also occur in the cytoplasm. LIN28A/B recruits TUT4/Zcchc11,
  which oligouridylates pre-let-7 at its 3′ end. Oligouridylated pre-let-7 then undergoes
  exonuclease degradation by DIS3L2. LIN28A/B binding to pre-let-7 could interfere
  with Dicer cleavage, providing the mechanism for TUTase-independent repression.
  Without this inhibition, pre-let-7 undergoes processing by Dicer to yield mature
  let-7 miRNA, which constitutes part of RISC and inhibits multiple oncogenes through
  RNAi.
