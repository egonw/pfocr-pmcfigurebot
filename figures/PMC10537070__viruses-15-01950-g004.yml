caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action of β-HPV in the vulva. As represented in the
  schematic on the left, β-HPV infects cells, preferentially within hair follicles,
  without viral integration with or without alpha-HPV co-infection. There is accumulation
  of DNA damage via some other carcinogenic insult, which causes loss of functional
  p53 and/or alterations of the NOTCH signaling pathway, and ultimately squamous cell
  carcinoma, where beta HPV may or may not be detectable. The atypical squamous proliferation
  (ASP) shown in the panels in the middle (top, H&E with virus emblems representative
  of the positive HPV genotyping results, bottom: p53 immunohistochemistry) is a case
  from our series, with matched invasive carcinoma in the right panels (top, H&E and
  bottom, p53 staining). deVIL, differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesions;
  VAAD, vulvar acanthosis with altered differentiation.'
