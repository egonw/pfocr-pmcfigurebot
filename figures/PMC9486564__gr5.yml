caption: HDAC10-selective inhibitors prevent rescue of DFMO-mediated cytostasis and
  restoration of polyamine homeostasis by N8-AcSpd.A, structures of DKFZ-728 and DKFZ-748
  HDAC10 inhibitors. B, HDAC10 inhibitors dose-dependently blocked rescue of cell
  growth by N8-AcSpd. HCT116 WT cells were pretreated 24 h with concentrations of
  HDAC10 inhibitors DKFZ-728 or DKFZ-748 ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM, followed by 96-h
  cotreatments with 5 mM DFMO, HDAC10 inhibitor, 1 mM AG, and increasing concentrations
  of N8-AcSpd. Percent growth relative to untreated cells was determined using CellTiter
  Blue–based fluorescence. C, pharmacological HDAC inhibition was as effective as
  genetic knockout in preventing entry of N8-AcSpd into the polyamine metabolic pathway.
  Treatment with the polyamine transport inhibitor Trimer44NMe prevented rescue by
  N8-AcSpd. HCT116 cells were treated as for growth assays and polyamines were determined
  by HPLC. ∗ indicates significantly increased intracellular polyamine concentration
  (Spd or Spm; p ≤ 0.05) compared to that of cells treated with DFMO alone. DFMO,
  diflouromethylornithine; HDAC10, histone deacetylase-10; N8-AcSpd, N8-acetylated
  spermidine.
