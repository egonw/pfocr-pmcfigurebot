caption: NRF2- and OXPHOS-signaling pathways are enriched in recurrent HPV-related
  HNSCC. A, RNA expression assays performed on 10 paired pHNSCC and rHNSCC. B, PANTHER
  pathway analysis of differentially-expressed genes comparing rHNSCC with pHNSCC.
  Pathways with over-representation test FDR q value < 0.05 are displayed. C, GSEA
  of rHNSCC versus pHNSCC. Normalized enrichment scores (NES) plotted. FDR q values
  labeled within the bars. Top, GSEA using panel of metabolic gene sets. Bottom, GSEA
  using panel of oncogenic gene sets. D, Left, Hierarchical clustering of hallmark
  OXPHOS gene set among pHNSCC and rHNSCC. Rows represent genes. Columns represent
  tumors. Row and column dendrograms demonstrate clustering results. Normalized expression
  counts in cells. Color bars in the upper plot illustrate ssGSEA enrichment score.
  DDR, Reactome p53-dependent DNA damage repair; FA, hallmark fatty-acid metabolism;
  MYC, hallmark MYC v1; NRF2 Core, NRF2 core signature (). Right, NRF2 ssGSEA enrichment
  scores between groups.
