caption: 3D structure of the PI3K protein wherein there is a PIK3 catalytic subunit
  gamma adaptor-binding domain (green), 2. Ras-binding domain (red), 3. C2 domain
  (blue), 4. phosphoinositide 3-kinase family accessory domain (yellow), and 5. phosphoinositide
  3/4-kinase domain (purple). Staurosporine is a PI3K inhibitor embedded in the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase domain.
