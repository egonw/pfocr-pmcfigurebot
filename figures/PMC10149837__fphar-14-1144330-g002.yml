caption: Cordycepin decreases the function of macrophage I (M1 macrophages) (A). PCA
  showed the difference between the two groups (B). DEGs of two groups. The marked
  genes by tags were those with a p-value < 0.005 and a log Fc > 0.25 (C). Heatmap
  was chosen to show the top 20 up- and downregulated genes (D). Heatmap was chosen
  to show the correlations of the top 20 genes (E). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  was performed utilizing the KEGG pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg). Based
  on the function of macrophages, the pathways were selected. The decreasing function
  is represented by the bar graphs (blue), and the increasing function is represented
  by the bar graphs (red) (F). Heatmap was chosen to show the differential gene expression
  of molecular markers of the M1 phenotype. Cordycepin was represented by “COR”.
