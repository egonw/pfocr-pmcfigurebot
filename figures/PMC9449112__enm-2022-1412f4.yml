caption: Effects of conditioned media (CM) and irisin treatment on the signaling pathway
  of hepatic stellate cells. LX-2 cells were treated with CM from M1 macrophages with
  or without irisin 10 nM for 6 hours. (A-C) Western blotting analysis of the protein
  expressions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved-PARP (c-PARP), phopho-protein
  kinase B (pAKT), AKT, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2),
  ERK1/2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in LX-2 cells after
  6 hours treatment. Representative Western blot images (A) and relative densitometric
  analysis of PARP, c-PARP, pAKT, AKT, pERK1/2, ERK1/2 (B) and of tissue inhibitor
  of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) (C) of three independent experiments with protein
  expression normalized to GAPDH. (D) Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis
  of relative mRNA expression of TIMP-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix
  metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) normalized to GAPDH in LX-2 cells after 6 hours treatment.
  All data are presented as meanÂ±standard error of the mean (n=3). aP<0.05; bP<0.01;
  cP<0.001.
