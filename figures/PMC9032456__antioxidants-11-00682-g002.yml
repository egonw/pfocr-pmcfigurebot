caption: PA activated the TLR-related genes expression and MAPK signaling pathway
  in macrophages. (A) The mRNA expression level of TLR-related genes after PA treatment.
  (B) Western blot analysis of MAPK signaling activation after PA treatment. The ratios
  of p-ERK to ERK, p-p38 to p38, p-JNK to JNK and p-IKK to IKK were determined. The
  data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 6) and are analyzed using independent
  t-tests. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 indicate significant differences compared with
  the control group.
