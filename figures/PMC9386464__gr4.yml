caption: CCNC deficiency impairs lipid synthesis in BAT. (A) Volcano plot comparison
  of gene expression in BAT of CcncUcp1(KO) and control mice (n = 3 per group) by
  RNA-seq. (B) Cluster analysis of all differentially expressed genes in BAT of CcncUcp1(KO)
  mice. KEGG pathway analyses of signaling pathways up-regulated (C) and down-regulated
  (D) in BAT of CcncUcp1(KO) mice. (E) Down-regulated genes in insulin signaling pathway
  are shown in heat map. (F) Schematic representation of the effects of CCNC knockout
  on lipogenic genes expression. Significantly down-regulated genes in this pathway
  are marked by red color. Pc, pyruvate carboxylase; Gpdh, Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  Pck1, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1; Acly, ATP-citrate lyase; Acaca, Acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; Fasn, fatty acids synthase. (G-I) qRT-PCR analysis of pan-adipose genes
  (G), BAT-related genes (H) and lipid transport and lipolysis genes (I) in BAT from
  control and CcncMyf5(KO) mice. ∗ p < 0.05 and ∗∗ p < 0.01 vs control. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
