caption: DEGs and GSEA analysis of GI tract cancer WTS data. (a) Barplot indicating
  normalized enrichment score (NES) in F. nucleatum−high vs. F. nucleatum−low groups
  for every cancer type. (b) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrating the
  common pathway (G2M checkpoint) in the F. nucleatum−high group of every cancer type
  (CRC NES = 1.692, Nom p-value = 0.042, FDR q-value = 0.024; ESCC NES = 1.754, Nom
  p-value = 0.008, FDR q-value = 0.039; GC NES = 1.630, Nom p-value = 0.039, FDR q-value
  = 0.452). (c) Boxplot representing the expression of the G2M pathway−related genes
  between cancer and normal tissues. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Statistical significance
  was calculated using the Wilcoxon test. (d) Heatmap for the z−score−converted expression
  of the EMT pathway- and angiogenesis pathway-related genes.
