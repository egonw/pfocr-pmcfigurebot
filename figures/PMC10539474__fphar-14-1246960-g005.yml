caption: 'SIL inhibits the JNK signaling pathway. (A–C) Immunofluorescence images
  of Drosophila (esg-GFP/CyO) posterior midguts of GFP and pJNK staining in control
  flies and 7% DSS stimulated flies supplemented with or without 1 µM SIL. pJNK: red,
  a marker that indicates the activated JNK signaling pathway. Scale bars represent
  10 µm. (D) Quantitation of pJNK fluorescence intensity per cell (n = 184, 196, 171).
  (E) Quantification of relative mRNA expression of the JNK signal-regulated genes
  (Mmp1, MtnA, and dpp) in the midguts of control flies and 7% DSS stimulated flies
  supplemented with or without 1 µM SIL. (F–H) Immunofluorescence images of Drosophila
  posterior midguts of GFP and Dl staining in 7% DSS stimulated flies. esg ts -Gal4-driven:
  UAS-lacZ, USA-bsk DN  without SIL, and USA-bsk DN  with 1 µM SIL. Scale bars represent
  25 µm. (I,J) Quantification of the ratio of esg-GFP positive cells and Dl positive
  cells to DAPI positive cells per ROI (n = 30, 38, 42). (K) Quantification of the
  number of pH3 positive cells in the whole guts of flies (n = 19, 22, 24). Data are
  represented as means ± SD. Student’s t-tests, ns represents p > 0.05, ****p < 0.0001.'
