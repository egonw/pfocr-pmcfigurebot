caption: Proposed dual sites of action of AC7 in peptide (ACTH) synthesis and release.
  AC7 can participate in both the control of synthesis and release of ACTH. CRF (CRH)
  activates AC7 through a Gs-coupled mechanism and increases production of cAMP. The
  cAMP enhances the active state of both PKA and Epac2. PKA acts through its canonical
  CREB transcription activator pathway by phosphorylating CREB and translocating it
  to the nucleus to bind to its DNA promoter sequence. The binding of CREB to DNA
  is necessary but not sufficient to activate the transcription of POMC (the precursor
  to ACTH). The activation and DNA binding of Nur77 is a requirement for initiation
  of transcription. The phosphorylation and translocation of Nur77 to the nucleus,
  requires a coordinated interaction of ERK, PKA and CAMKII (; ). Two sites for Nur77-binding
  exist upstream of the POMC transcription initiation site, a Nur77-binding response
  element (NBRE), and a Nur response element (NurRE), and both need to be occupied
  by Nur77 to initiate the transcription of POMC. Once the POMC RNA is produced, it
  is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum for protein synthesis, and the processing
  of the pre-propeptide (POMC) by proprotein convertase (PC1/3) into ACTH and the
  other POMC derived peptides. The ACTH has to be loaded into dense core vesicles
  which are generated by “budding” of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the “cargo” of
  these vesicles (ACTH) is then readied for release by a calcium-dependent mechanism
  through fusion with the cellular membrane. AC7 is integral in the process of loading
  and preparing vesicles for release. AC7 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane where it can be activated by Gαq12. The activation of Gq12 by guanine nucleotide
  exchange is instigated by a sensor on the budding vesicle, SEC24. The cAMP produced
  by AC7 at this site can activate PKA (which is recruited to this site by an AKAP).
  PKA-dependent phosphorylation of an ill-defined substrate is then central to the
  process of release of the concentrated cargo by controlling the uncoating and separation
  of the maturing vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum. This Figure was generated
