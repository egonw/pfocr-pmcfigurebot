caption: 'Effects of density of BMSCs on osteogenic differentiation and mineralization
  of 3D bio-printed hydrogel scaffolds. (a) Mineralization of hydrogel scaffolds with
  different densities of BMSCs in vitro for day 7, 14, and 21 as shown by alizarin
  red staining. (b) Quantitation of mineralization levels of hydrogels. Scale bar:
  200 ​μm αp<0.05 vs T0; βp<0.05 vs T5; γp<0.05 vs T6; δp<0.05 vs T7. (c) Elemental
  composition of mineralized nodules as determined by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
  (EDS). Scanning electron micrograph of mineralized nodules, elemental distribution
  of P and Ca elements, and the spectrum of various elemental compositions are shown.
  (d) Quantitative assays of Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of encapsulated BMSCs
  in hydrogel scaffolds after culturing for 7, 14, and 21 days. αp<0.05 vs T5; βp<0.05
  vs T6; γp<0.05 vs T7. Relative gene expression levels of osteogenic markers (e)
  Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), (f) Osterix, (g) ALP, (h) osteocalcin
  (OCN) and (i) type I collagen (Col-1) of BMSCs after day 7 and day14 culture in
  the hydrogels. αp<0.05 vs control; βp<0.05 vs T5; γp<0.05 vs T6; δp<0.05 vs T7.
