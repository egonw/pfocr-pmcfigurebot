caption: The activity of the NF-κB/VEGF signaling pathway is upregulated by PNCK overexpression
  in NPC cells. (a) Dot plot of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) shows significant
  changes in NF-κB and VEGF signaling pathways. (b) GSEA shows negative regulation
  of NF-κB transcription factor activity enriched in the PNCK-low expression phenotype.
  (c) WB was used to investigate the P65, p-P65, p-IκB, GAPDH, and Histone-H3. The
  correlation between PNCK and VEGFA in (d) internal cohort and (e) GSE102349 cohort.
  (f, g) The expression of VEGFA levels in NPC cells was evaluated by PCR and WB.
