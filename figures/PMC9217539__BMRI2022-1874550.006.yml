caption: 'The PI3K inhibitors reduced Rab22a promoting the proliferation of thyroid
  cancer cells. The TPC1 and K1 cell proliferation were decreased by PI3K inhibitor
  treatment, as shown by CCK8 and colony formation assays (a and b). Data are shown
  as mean ± SD of the three independent experiments: ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗P < 0.05.'
