caption: 'Differentially accumulated metabolites revealed the enrichment of key metabolic
  pathways in Rb vitreous humor. (A) Principal component analysis of metabolite profiling
  in the vitreous humor of Rb and pediatric controls. (B) Density plot showing the
  distribution of metabolite intensity before and after normalization. (C) Volcano
  plot of differentially accumulated metabolites. p < 0.05 (in red), FC > 2: significantly
  increased; p < 0.05, FC < 2 (in blue): significantly reduced relative to the control.
  (D) Hierarchical clustering heatmap of significant metabolites in the vitreous humor
  of Rb and controls using Pearson correlation as the metric distance. The color code
  indicates the metaboliteâ€™s abundance. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  accumulated metabolites.'
