caption: Ube2d2â€™s role in p53 degradation, and the signaling pathway demonstrating
  the role of miR-1228-3p and its target Ube2d2 in regulating the degradation of p53.
  Here, Ube2d2 is shown transferring ubiquitin (ub) onto p53 via MDM2 and, thus, targeting
  p53 for degradation. miR-1228-3p inhibits the translation of Ube2d2. Therefore,
  radiation-induced expression of miR-1228-3p should reduce Ube2d2-mediated degradation
  of p53. Thus, increased expression of miR-1228-3p is expected to result in elevated
  p53 levels. The blue arrows represent pathway activation, whereas the red arrows
  illustrate pathway inhibition. E1 represents ubiquitin-activating enzymes that catalyze
  the first step in the ubiquitination reaction.
