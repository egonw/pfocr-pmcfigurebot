caption: The regulatory mechanisms and immunosuppressive function of CD73 in HNSCC.
  (A) The enrichment score of HALLMAKR pathways influenced by CD73. NES, normalized
  enrichment score. (B) Visualization of top 1 pathway. (C) Visualization of the second
  pathway. (D) Comparison of stromal score calculated by ESTIMATE algorithm. (E) Comparison
  of ESTIMATE score calculated by ESTIMATE algorithm. (F) Comparison of tumor purity
  calculated by ESTIMATE algorithm. (G) Comparison of immune score calculated by ESTIMATE
  algorithm. (H) Comparison of proportions of 22 immune cell types estimated by CIBERSORT
  algorithm. (I) Comparison of proportions of different kinds of cells estimated by
  MCP-counter algorithm. (J) The expression pattern of CD73 in tumor microenvironment
  at single-cell revolution, cells were clustered and annotated through TISCH database.
  (K) The expression of CD73 in these cells. The redder the color, the more CD73 is
  expressed in these cells. (L) Correlations between CD73 expression and various tumor
  signatures. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001; ns, no significance.
article_title: Integrated multi-omics analysis identifies CD73 as a prognostic biomarker
  and immunotherapy response predictor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
