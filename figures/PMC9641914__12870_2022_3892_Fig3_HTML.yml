caption: Phenylpropanoids were produced by PpCAD1. (a) Safranin-O staining of gametophores
  (bar = 2 mm) and phyllids (bar = 200 μm). (b) HPLC fingerprints of extracted cytoplasm
  from WT, Ppcad1_ko, and PpCAD1_OE plants. Asterisk indicated significant changes
  of three peaks. (c) CAD activity. (d) Total phenolic content. Values were presented
  as means ± SD and analyzed using one-way ANOVA (**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05). (e) Proposed
  lignin biosynthetic pathway in P. patens. The numbers in the bracket represented
  the number of enzymes in each family. cinnamate 4-hydroxylases (C4H); cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductases (CCR); cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD); caffeic acid O-methyltransferase
  (COMT); caffeoyl coenzyme acid O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT); cinnamate 3-hydroxylases
  (C3H). (f) The expression of genes associated with lignin. The red box indicated
  a remarkable increase of genes in PpCAD1_OE plants. The color scale represented
  relative expression levels
