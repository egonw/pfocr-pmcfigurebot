caption: Transcriptomic analysis. (A) Box plot. Box plots of expression levels of
  different samples, where the abscissa is the sample name, and the ordinate is log10
  (FPKM + 1). (B) The abscissa represents the fold change (log2 Fold Change) of gene
  expression between different samples or comparison combinations, the larger the
  absolute value of the abscissa, the greater the fold change of expression between
  the two comparison combinations; the ordinate represents the significance level
  of the expression difference. Up-regulated genes are indicated by red dots, down-regulated
  genes are indicated by green dots and blue dots are genes that did not change significantly.
  (C) The abscissa is the sample, the ordinate is the differential gene, the left
  side is the clustering of genes according to the similarity of expression, the upper
  is the clustering of each sample according to the similarity of the expression profile,
  the expression level is gradually increased from blue to red and the numbers are
  uniform the relative expression level after transformation. (D) The abscissa represents
  the name of GO items, which are divided into three categories by boxes, BP biological
  process, CC cell components and MF molecular functions, which are distinguished
  by different bars and boxes and the ordinate is the number of genes enriched by
  GO items. (E) The vertical axis in the figure represents different pathways, and
  the horizontal axis represents the proportion of significantly differentially expressed
  genes in the corresponding pathway to all genes in the pathway. The size of the
  circle represents the number of genes enriched in the corresponding pathway, and
  the larger the circle, the more genes are enriched in the pathway. The color represents
  the significance of enrichment, and the closer to red, the more significant it is.
