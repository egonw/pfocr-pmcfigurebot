caption: Stichloroside C2 (STC2) inhibited epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. (a) MDA-MB-231 and 4 T1 cells were
  treated with different concentrations of STC2 (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM) for 6 h, and
  the protein expression levels of E-cadherin and vimentin were detected by western
  blot. (b) Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments,
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to the control group.
