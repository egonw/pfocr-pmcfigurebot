caption: MiR-451a regulated neuroinflammation in the microglia via NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1
  pathway. (A) Representative image of NLRP3 (Magenta), IBA1 (Red), and DAPI (Blue)
  in the mPFC of each group. Scale bar, 50 μm. (B) The percentage of NLRP3+ and NLRP3+IBA1+
  area in the mPFC. (C, D) Representative Western blot bands and densitometry analysis
  of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 in the mPFC of each group. (E, F) Representative Western
  blot bands and densitometry analysis of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 in the primary
  microglia after treatment of miR-451a mimic. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n
  = 6 per group. Significance was evaluated with two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc
  test. *p <0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
