caption: 'Signal transduction mechanism between C9orf139/miR-661/HDAC11 and mouse
  xenograft model. (A–E) Double luciferase assay. A-B: miR-661 mimic significantly
  reduced the expression of luciferase driven by C9orf139, while luciferase expression
  recovered after site mutation. *p < 0.05 vs. NC mimics, ^p < 0.05 vs. miR-661 mimics.
  C-D: miR-661 mimic significantly lessened luciferase expression driven by HDAC11-3-UTR,
  while luciferase expression recovered after site mutation. *p < 0.05 vs. NC mimics,
  ^p < 0.05 vs. miR-661 mimics. E: In TE-1 cells, miR-661 mimic significantly reduced
  luciferase expression driven by HDAC11-3-UTR, but increased luciferase expression
  after co-transfection with C9orf139. *p < 0.05 vs. NC mimics, ^p < 0.05 vs. miR-661
  mimics. (F) The regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway by C9orf139/miR-661/HDAC11
  was detected by WB. (G) Gray analysis of F. *p < 0.05 vs. shNC, ^p < 0.05 vs. shC9orfl39#1.
  (H) String database predicted HDAC11 key interacting proteins. (I) The mice xenograft
  models and tumors. (J) The volumetric of tumors was measured after removing the
  tumors from the mice xenograft models. *p < 0.05 vs. shNC. (K) Tumor weight of xenograft
  model mice was measured. *p < 0.05 vs. shNC. All data were presented as mean ± SD.'
