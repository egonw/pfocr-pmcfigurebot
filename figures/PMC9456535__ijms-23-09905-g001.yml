caption: 'Intracellular survival and stress resistance of ΔftcR during the life cycle
  of Brucella melitensis 16M: (A) Intracellular survival of GFP-expressing WT and
  ΔftcR strains in RAW264.7 cells at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. Values are means ± SD from
  at least three independent experiments, and were assessed using a nonparametric
  Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multi-comparison statistical analysis. (B) The survival
  of WT, ΔftcR, and ΔftcR-C strains under stress conditions. The WT, ΔftcR, and ΔftcR-C
  strains were grown in Brucella Broth to the stationary phase, after which the cells
  were washed and incubated under different stress growth conditions. Viable cell
  counts were recorded after 0.5 h of challenge. (C) The biofilms of WT, ΔftcR, and
  ΔftcR-C were treated with different stress conditions for 20 d, and their biomass
  was quantified using a crystal violet (CV) assay. Each point represents an independent
  well. (D) Survival of WT and ΔftcR cells in biofilms grown under different stress
  conditions. Error bars represent standard error (n ≥ 3). * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01,
  unpaired Student’s t-test. ns, not significant.'
