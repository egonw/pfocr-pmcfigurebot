caption: 'Morphological changes induced by PUG in RAW264.7 cells: Cells were grown
  in DMEM media at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. After attaining
  the desired growth, the cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/plate. Then, LPS (1 μg/mL)
  treatment for 1 h, followed by PUG (6 μM) treatment for 24 h were given. After treatment,
  plates were observed under an inverted microscope. (A) Control cells. (B) LPS-stimulated
  cells. (C) LPS + PUG (6 μM) co-treated cells.'
