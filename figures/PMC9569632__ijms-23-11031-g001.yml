caption: PD1 and PD-L1 expression in human lung cancer cell lines and primary lung
  tumors. PD1 (ai) and PD-L1 (aii) mRNA expression analyzed by quantitative real-time
  RT-PCR. The PD1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression was normalized to the expression level
  of GAPDH as an internal control, which in normal human bronchial epithelial cells
  (HBEC) was defined as 1.0; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 when analyzed
  using Student’s t-test. PD1 (bi) and PD-L1 (bii) protein expression analyzed by
  Western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative images from
  immunohistochemical staining of PD1 (c) and PD-L1 (d) in primary lung tumor samples.
  TPS, tumor proportion score. Magnification, 400×.
