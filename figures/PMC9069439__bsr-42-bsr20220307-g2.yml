figure_title: ER stress promoted LPS induced production and secretion of inflammatory
  factors in THP-1 cells
caption: 'ELISA assay of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 levels in the supernatants of THP-1
  cells treated with LPS, TM, TG. Values were expressed as mean ± SD (n=5). *P<0.05
  compared with untreated control cells. #P<0.05 compared with cells treated with
  LPS alone.'
