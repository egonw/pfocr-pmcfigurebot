caption: The potential mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effect of celastrol.
  Celastrol protects against obesity through both central and peripheral mechanisms.
  Mainly, in the hypothalamus, celastrol enhances leptin sensitivity by reducing ER
  stress via inhibition of PERK phosphorylation and possible GRP78, as well as activating
  IL1R and inhibiting PTP1B/TCPTP pathways. Celastrol can also attenuate food intake
  of obese mice by downregulating the levels of GAL, GALR1 and GALR3 in the brain.
  In terms of peripheral mechanisms, celastrol alleviates inflammatory responses by
  inhibiting both TLR3/NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-KB pathway. Celastrol also reduces
  inflammation and improves metabolic disorders by increasing Nur77/p62-mediated mitophagy.
  Celastrol activates HSF1/PGC1α, which results in the enhancement of energy expenditure
  and mitochondrial function in adipose tissues and muscles. Celastrol inhibits adipocyte
  differentiation and increases lipid metabolism by blocking PPARγ2- or C/EBPα-mediated
  transcriptional activity. Moreover, celastrol improves lipid metabolism by upregulating
  ABCA1, by reducing liver lipid synthesis, and by inhibiting gut lipid absorption
  by modulating gut microbiota. ABCA1—ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; C/EBPα—CCAAT/enhancer
