caption: Schematic of the innate immune signaling pathways in Leydig cells. Various
  toll-like receptors (TLRs), except for TLR3 and TLR4, initiate the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway. TLR3 initiates the TRIF-dependent pathway, whereas TLR4 initiates
  both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway induces the
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1, CXCL10)
  through activation of NF-κB and AP-1. The TRIF-dependent pathway induces the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type 1 interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β)
  via the activation of NF-κB and IRF3. Cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 initiate
  innate antiviral responses through the activation of IPS-1 located on the outer
  membrane of the mitochondria. The IPS-1-dependent pathway induces the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines through NF-κB activation and also induces
  the expression of type 1 interferons through IRF3 activation. DNA sensors p204,
  cGAS, and DAI trigger antiviral responses through the activation of STING localized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. The STING-dependent signaling pathway predominantly
  induces type 1 interferon expression. Type 1 interferons induce the expression of
  the antiviral proteins, including ISG15, OAS1, and MX1, in autocrine and paracrine
  manners. Tyro3, Axl and Mer receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM) can be activated by
  their common ligand Gas6, which initiates signaling pathway to induce the expression
  of SOCS1/3, and SOCS1/3 inhibit IFN-triggered antiviral responses. AP-1, activator
