caption: Identification of differentially expressed cross-linked proteins in response
  to IFNα (data retrieved from MaxQuant). (A) Venn diagram representing common and
  exclusive peptide counts identified in the IFNα14 treated and untreated Flo-1 samples.
  Peptide length distribution from the untreated (B) and IFNα (C) treated cross-linked
  samples. (D) Heatmap representing log2(LFQ intensities) between untreated and IFNα14
  treated Flo-1 cells. The left panel depicts the most upregulated proteins in presence
  of IFNα. (E) A bar plot representing top 20 enriched pathways following IFNα treatment.
  IFNα responsive upregulated proteins over fourfold change were analyzed by the Reactome
  pathway database.
