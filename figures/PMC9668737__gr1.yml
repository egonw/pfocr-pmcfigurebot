caption: 'Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) pUL21 alters the rate of ceramide (Cer) to
  sphingomyelin (SM) conversion in cultured cells.A, simplified schematic diagram
  of sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways that lead from sphingosine (Sph) to SM and
  glycosphingolipids (hexosylceramide; HexCer), or to phosphatidylcholine (PC) via
  a “salvage” pathway. In this salvage pathway, Sph-1-phosphate is converted to trans-2-hexadecenal,
  then trans-2-hexadecenoic acid and trans-2-hexadecenoyl-coA before being converted
  to palmitoyl-coA (), which is in turn conjugated to glycerol-3-phosphate to form
  lysophosphatidic acid before being converted to phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol,
  and then PC (). Cer to SM conversion is accelerated by the transport protein CERT,
  which is selectively inhibited by HPA-12. B, rate of Sph conversion to Cer, SM,
  or PC was measured in HaCaT cells, untreated or treated with 1 μM HPA-12, and in
  HaCaT cells stably expressing pUL21 (HaCaT21). Cells were incubated with 5 μM “clickable”
  alkyne-Sph (pulse) for 5 min and harvested for lipid extraction either immediately
  (0 min) or at the indicated times (chase). Extracted lipids were bioconjugated to
  3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin, separated by HPTLC and detected using UV light. Separated
  lipids were identified using clickable standards (Stds) and previous literature
  (). Data are from one representative experiment of two independent repeats. C, quantitation
  of the lipid intensities from (B) as determined by densitometry and represented
  as percentage fraction of total signal. D, rate of SM synthesis expressed as its
  fraction in the cumulative signal for SM and Cer. E, the ratio of alkyne-Sph incorporated
  into either Cer or SM as a proportion of total alkyne-lipid signal, representing
  the influx of Sph into the SM biosynthetic pathway. For D and E, the data represent
  two independent experiments (mean ± SD). Data points are labeled if significantly
  different to parental HaCaT cells: ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; and ∗∗∗∗p <
  0.0001 (two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). F, the resolubilized
  proteins precipitated during lipid extraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
  using the antibodies listed. Where indicated, the gel was supplemented with PhosTag
  reagent to retard the migration of phosphorylated proteins, thus enhancing the separation
  of CERT that is hypophosphorylated (CERTO) or hyperphosphorylated (CERTP). GAPDH
  serves as a loading control.'
