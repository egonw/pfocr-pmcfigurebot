caption: a Venn graph showed the intersection of signal pathways enriched in tumors
  of nude mice and human. b Top ten standard NES of TT vs. TP in patients and OE vs.
  NC in nude mice; c GSEA analysis of enrichment plot of MEK pathway. d Screening
  of key genes of the MEK pathway signaling pathway in TT vs. TP groups (12 samples
  each for TT or TP group). e Using western blot and qPCR to verify the expression
  of MAPK/MEK key molecules in patient’s TT and TP groups (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, 12 samples each for TT or TP group).
