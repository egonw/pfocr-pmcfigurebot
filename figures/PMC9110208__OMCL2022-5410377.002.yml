caption: Orcinol glucoside (OG) inhibits activity and differentiation of osteoclast
  in SAMP6 mice and RAW264.7 cells. (a) TRAP staining images of the tibias. (b, c)
  Serum TRAP and CTSK activity were determined by ELISA (n = 8‐9). (d) The effect
  of OG on cell viability was detected by CCK-8 kits. (e) The morphological feature
  of osteoclast derived from RAW264.7 cells under a microscope (400x). (f) Representative
  TRAP staining images of osteoclast for treated with RANKL and OG and subsequently
  treated with H2O2. (g) The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated (>3 nuclei) osteoclasts.
  (h) TRAP activities in osteoclast. Images presented are representative of ≥3 sections
  for each group or independent experiments, and data are expressed as mean ± SD.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the indicated group.
