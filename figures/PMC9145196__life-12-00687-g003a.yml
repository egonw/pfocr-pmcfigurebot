caption: The apoptotic effect of Apl-1 on leukemia and prostate cancer cells is mediated
  through mitochondrial dysfunction and PI3K/AKT pathway. Cells were treated with
  different concentrations of Apl-1 for 24 h. (a) Flow cytometry analysis with rhodamine
  123 staining to assess MMP destruction. (b) Annexin V/PI staining was used to evaluate
  the effect of cell apoptosis by flow cytometry analysis, and (c) fluorescence microscope
  was used to determine the changes in the nucleus morphology by DAPI staining. (d)
  The effect of Apl-1 on the expression of apoptosis-related and PI3K/AKT pathway
  proteins was determined with the Western blotting analysis. GAPDH acted as the loading
  control. The results are presented as the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments.
  (*** p < 0.001, control vs. Apl-1 group).
