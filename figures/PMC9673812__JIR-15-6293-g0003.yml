caption: Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate alleviates cholesterol crystals-induced pyroptotic
  damage in HUVECs. HUVECs were incubated with 500 μM cholesterol crystals (CC) for
  16 h. 10, 20, 40 μM Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) was added 1 h before CC
  treatment. (A) Cell death was determined using PI staining. (B) NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1,
  GSDMD and IL-1β protein levels were determined by Western blot. (C) NLRP3 specks
  were detected by immunofluorescence. Data are represented as mean ± SD of three
  independent replicates; **P < 0.01 vs VEH group; §P < 0.05, §§P < 0.01 vs cholesterol
  crystals group; Scale bar = 10 μm.
