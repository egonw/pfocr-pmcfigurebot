caption: 'Cell types in which cGAMP conduits function and the CDNs they transport.
  Data collected for cells types in which conduit deficiency or specific chemical
  inhibition prevented STING pathway activation in response to exogenous CDNs. FDA
  approved drugs are shown in red. Primary cells are shown in black and cancer cell
  lines in blue. Mouse cell lines and conduits tested in mice are shown in italics.
  ϕ sulfasalazine has been shown not only to inhibit indicated channels but also IFN-β
  production *Not major importer as knockout or chemical inhibition only marginally
  reduces CDN mediated responses. **Direct CDN uptake not proven in vitro but in vivo
  conduit required for STING pathway activation in presence of exogenous CDNs. †Unclear
  if imported. †† Minimal effect of transporter on uptake. # - P2X7 forms a large
  non-selective pore for hydrophilic substances ~0.9 KDa in size therefore although
  not formally shown it is assumed there is no CDN specificity. Ψ reviewed by Salameh
  and Dhein (). λ reviewed by Müller and Namasivayam (). ω reviewed by Cole (). MLF,
  mouse lymphatic fibroblasts; BMM, bone marrow-derived macrophages; MEF, mouse embryonic
  fibroblasts; HFF, human foreskin fibroblasts; BMDM, bone-marrow-derived macrophages;
