caption: 'Transcription factor HOXB2 specifically activates NUSAP1. (A and B) JASPAR
  website was used to predict the binding of HOXB2 and NUSAP1. (C) RT-qPCR and (D)
  western blotting was performed to detect the expression of HOXB2 in nephroblastoma
  cell lines. **P<0.001, ***P<0.001 vs. 293T. (E) RT-qPCR and (F) western blotting
  was performed to detect the expression of HOXB2 in nephroblastoma cell lines after
  overexpression of HOXB2. (G) The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the relationship
  between HOXB2 and NUSAP1. (H) Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the
  relationship between HOXB2 and NUSAP1. (I) Western blotting was conducted to detect
  the expression of NUSAP1 in nephroblastoma cells after overexpression of HOXB2.
  ***P<0.001 vs. Ov-NC. (J) RT-qPCR and (K) western blotting were performed to detect
  the expression of NUSAP1 in nephroblastoma cells after cell transfections. ***P<0.001
  vs. shRNA-NC; ###P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NUSAP1 + Ov-NC. HOXB2, homeobox protein Hox-B2;
  NUSAP1, nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; Ov, overexpression vector; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control;
  WT, wild-type; MUT, mutant.'
article_title: Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation,
  invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
