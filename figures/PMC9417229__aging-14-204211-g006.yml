caption: SIAH1 inhibits the NF-κB pathway via RPS3 downregulation. (A) Western blotting
  for NF-κB p65 in A2780 cells separately transfected with Vector, SIAH1, Clt-shRNA
  and sh-SIAH1 for 48 h. (B) Western blotting for NF-κB p65 in A2780 cells separately
  transfected with Vector, RPS3, Clt-shRNA and sh-RPS3 for 48 h. (C) Western blotting
  for SIAH1, RPS3 and NF-κB p65 in A2780 cells separately transfected with SIAH1and
  sh-SIAH1 for 48 h, and treated with PDTC (200 μM) for 24 h. A2780 cells were separately
  transfected with SIAH1 and sh-SIAH1 for 48 h and treated with PDTC for 24 h. The
  number of Cell Colonies was determined (D), the cell number of Transwell assay was
  obtained (E), the Wound closure percentage was calculated (0, 24, 48, 72 and 96
  h) (F), and the Edu positive rates (G), cell viability (H, I left panels), and IC50
  for cDDP (H, I right panels) were measured in A2780 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001.
