caption: (A) Pathways and GO terms identified by differential transcriptomic, chromatin
  accessibility, and/or DNA methylation are shown in the bubble plot. The bubbles
  indicate pathways or terms with more than 10 genes and FDR < 5%. The bubble shades
  represent the −log10 (FDR), and the size indicates the proportion of genes in the
  pathway or term that were significantly different between deceased and alive. Tacrolimus,
  zotatifin, and nintedanib were identified as candidate drugs via interaction with
  pathways significant in all three omics. (B) Evolution of transcriptome and epigenetic
  changes in the interferon signaling and mRNA splicing pathways. DEGs were used to
  generate a module score representing the overall expression level of genes per pathway
  in CD14+ monocytes. The normalized average log2 CPM of DAC represents the pathway
  overall accessibility profile. The average percentage of DNA methylation for DMRs
  indicates the DNA methylation status of combined promoter and distal regions. The
  quantifications shown were derived at admission and the day 5 time points for the
  deceased and alive contrasts. Significance of differences between deceased and alive
  at different time points was tested using a Wilcoxon rank test and Cohen’s d effect
  size estimation as shown at the top for every significant variation at q value <
  0.05. (C) Protein-protein interaction network linking the biological target of candidate
  drugs with proteins encoded by genes in the pathways identified by multiple omics.
  The proteins targeted by the candidate drugs were accessed in DrugBank and intersected
  by means of the OmnipathR protein-protein interaction database. Proteins targeted
  by the drugs zotatifin, tacrolimus, and nintedanib are shown in purple. Genes tagged
  by at least two assays in the interferon signaling (nintedanib) and mRNA splicing
  (tacrolimus and zotatifin) pathways are shown in brown. Intermediate genes marked
  in orange show the cascade from drug target to proteins encoded by genes in the
  tagged pathways.
