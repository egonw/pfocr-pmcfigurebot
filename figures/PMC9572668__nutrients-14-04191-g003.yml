caption: TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway inhibition by acylated-ghrelin to reduce I/R-induced
  cardiomyocyte infarction and inflammation. During myocardial I/R injury, TLR4 is
  expressed on the surface of the myocardial cell membrane, and PAMPs and DAMPs bind
  to it to release ROS. ROS activates NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn promotes the
  activation of procaspase-1 to caspase-1. Caspase-1 promotes the release of inflammatory
  factors IL-1β and IL-18 from the cell and triggers the inflammatory response. Ghrelin
  can downregulate the expression of TLR4, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of the
  inflammatory response and alleviating myocardial injury caused by I/R. TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; PAMPs, Pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage associated
  molecular patterns; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor thermal
  protein domain associated protein 3; IL-1β&IL-18, interleukin 1β&interleukin 18.
