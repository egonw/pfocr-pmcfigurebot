caption: Pygo1 overexpression in vitro enhanced A549 cell invasion and migration ability
  and promoted colony formation. (a, b) Transwell experiments and repeated measurement
  of absorbance (OD) values. (c, d) Wound healing test result visualization and repeated
  measurement of scratch area changes at different time points. (e) Visualization
  of colony formation assay results. (f, g) Western blotting analysis of cell lysates
  with different treatments using rabbit polyclonal antibody to E-cadherin. Quantitative
  analysis of protein expression levels using ImageJ and GraphPad Prism (n = 3). ns
  p ≥ 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
