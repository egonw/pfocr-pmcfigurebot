caption: Relationship between ischemic stroke and apoptosis, inflammation, autophagy,
  and oxidative stress. After cerebral ischemia, the activity of Na+/K+−ATP enzyme
  in ischemic penumbra decreases and the imbalance of ion homeostasis leads to cell
  membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx, resulting in excessive release of glutamate
  and excitotoxicity. With the influx of a large amount of Ca2+, the adhesion factors
  of endothelial cells increase, which leads to white blood cell recruitment, increases
  the contents of ROS and nitric oxide (NO), and causes oxidative stress. Then, NF-κB
  and MAPK signaling pathways are activated, causing cell apoptosis. Microglial and
  astrocytic cells are also activated, which up-regulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α),
  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), finally causing an inflammatory
  reaction. Meanwhile, microglia cell-mediated down-regulation of Toll-like receptor-4
  (TLR-4) induce autophagy.
