figure_title: Inhibition of BCR pathway during pirtobrutinib therapy in CLL patients
  previously treated with irreversible BTK inhibitors
caption: Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to therapy (C1D1) and 1 week
  (C1D8), 4 weeks or one cycle (C2D1), and three cycles (C4D1) after the start of
  pirtobrutinib. Samples were processed and cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque
  density centrifugation. A–E Effect of pirtobrutinib on BCR pathway proteins. Protein
  extracts were subjected to immunoblot assays to determine levels of phospho-BTK
  (Y223), BTK, phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), ERK, phospho-S6 (Ser235/236),
  and S6. Vinculin was used as loading control. F–I Violin plots depicting changes
  in phospho-BTK (F), total BTK (G), phospho-ERK (H), and total ERK (I) during therapy.
  Proteins were quantitated, normalized with vinculin, and presented as fold change
  to baseline (C1D1) value.
