caption: The IKKε gene editing in 3D4/21 cell clones from CRISPR gRNA treatment. The
  porcine IKKε genome DNA regions covering the gRNAs were amplified by PCR using the
  primers as shown in . The IKKε gene PCR products of individual 3D4/21 cell clones
  (A) and individual TBK1−/− 3D4/21 cell clones (B) were ligated into T vectors and
  the inserted DNA fragments were sequenced for analysis of base insertion/deletion
  (indel) mutations. Shown are representatives of one IKKε−/− cell clone (A) and one
  IKKε−/−TBK1−/− cell clone (B) obtained and used in subsequent experiments.
