caption: Aromatics catabolism from the coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl branch. (A)
  Conversion of diverse compounds like the coniferyl-alcohol, 4-hydroxybenzoate and
  caffeate to aromatics protocatechuate and catechol occurs, which in turn are processed
  through the different enzyme systems involved in the β oxidation pathway. The acetyl
  CoA and succinyl CoA formed then goes through the TCA cycle, leading to the formation
  of triglycerols lipids, PHA, and other fine chemicals. (B) The sinapyl alcohol forms
  pyruvate and oxaloacetate through the Galate fission pathway, which enters to TCA
  cycle, leading to the formation of fine chemicals. In contrast, the p-coumaryl alcohol
  forms succinate + acetyl CoA through the β-ketoadipate pathway and pyruvate + acetyl
  CoA through the protocatechuate fission pathway, which in turn enter the TCA cycle
  and help in the formation of lipids, PHA or other bulk chemicals.
