caption: ARG accelerated apoptosis of SiHa and HeLa cells. (A and B) The apoptosis
  rate of SiHa and HeLa cells was assessed by flow cytometry after both cells were
  treated with 5, 10 and 20 μM ARG for 24 h. (C) The relative protein expression of
  cleaved-caspase 3 was detected by Western blot. Data were present after normalized
  with GAPDH. *P˂0.05, **P˂0.01 and ***P˂0.001 vs. 0 μM ARG.
