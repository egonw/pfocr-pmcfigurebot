caption: Discovery urine proteomics of AD versus healthy age-matched controls. (A)
  Volcano plot showing the nominally differentially expressed (p < 0.05) proteins
  in blue and non-significantly different proteins in red. Ingenuity pathway analyses
  of those proteins observed to have differential expression in the urine of AD patients
  versus normal, age-matched controls; (B) Canonical pathway analysis demonstrating
  that significant differences are observed in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis which
  is a hallmark of AD; (C) Disease and functional analyses clearly identifies that
  there is significant changes in biomarkers involved in amyloidosis and AD, indicating
  that proteins present in the urine identify underlying disease processes occurring
  in the brain.
