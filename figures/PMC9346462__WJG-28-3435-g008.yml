caption: 'shRFWD3i influences the progress of hepatocellular carcinoma through the
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. A: Heatmap analysis showing the gene expression
  changes after RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) silencing (454 genes, above
  2-fold); B: Disease and functional analysis to classify genes enriched after RFWD3
  silencing; C: Classical pathway analysis indicates genes enriched after RFWD3 silencing;
  D: The microarray analysis reveals alteration in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway
  following RFWD3 silencing; E: Knowledge-based interaction network of Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling targets (> 2-fold change, P < 0.05). The intensity of the node color
  indicates the degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green) following RFWD3
  silencing in hepatocellular carcinoma cells; F-I: The expression of CREBBP, Wnt5A,
  JUN, Wnt7B and LRP6 were decreased, and the expression of KREMEN-1 was increased
  in the shRNAi group using western blot analysis, in rescue experiment, the results
  are reversed.'
