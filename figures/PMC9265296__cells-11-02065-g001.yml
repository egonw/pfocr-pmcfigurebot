caption: Graphical demonstration of the Hippo signaling pathway. Various physiological
  and pathological signals can induce the Hippo signaling pathway. In mammals, the
  core elements of the Hippo pathway mainly consist of serine/threonine kinases, transcriptional
  factors, and their cofactors. The transcriptional factors Yes-associated protein
  (YAP) and its coactivator PDZ-binding motif (TAZ/WWTR1) are the key effectors of
  the Hippo pathway. After physiological or pathological stimuli, sterile 20-like
  protein kinase (MST1/2) interacts, phosphorylates, and forms complexes with the
  adaptor protein Salvador 1 (SAV1), which phosphorylates large tumor suppressor (LATS1/2)
  and LATS1/2-interacting protein MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1). The phosphorylated
  LATS1/2–MOB1 complex then phosphorylates YAP and TAZ, which promotes cytoplasmic
  retention or polyubiquitination and consequent degradation of YAP/TAZ by proteasomes
  during autophagy. However, dephosphorylation of upstream kinases leads to the nuclear
  translocation of YAP and TAZ, where they can interact with various transcription
  factors including TEA domain DNA-binding family members (TEAD1–4) and regulate the
  expression of Hippo pathway target genes such as Ctgf and Cyr61.
