caption: Cisplatin attenuates the expression of SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling at different
  recovery times. (A) Determination of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels performed
  by Western blotting in mouse testes from the different groups. The blots were analyzed
  using Image J software. (B) Determination of the SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2 protein levels
  performed by Western blotting in mouse testes from the different groups. The blots
  were analyzed using Image J software. CP, cisplatin. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SEM (N = 3–6 per group). * p < 0.05 compared with controls.
