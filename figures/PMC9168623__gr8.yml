caption: Bar graphs of top 10 pathways identified in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) analysis that were significantly enriched for the top 20 hub genes.
  Each point corresponds to a KEGG pathway, y-axis displays the pathway’s name, x-axis
  displays the fold enrichment, dot size corresponds to the number of genes, the colour
  bar displays the –log10 (P-value), red indicates a high value, and blue indicates
  a low value. (a) P vs. N, (b) M vs. N. The greater the fold enrichment, the greater
  the significance of DEG enrichment in this pathway. P vs. N, primary tumour tissue
  samples obtained from patients with infiltrating duct carcinoma compared with normal
  breast tissue samples; M vs. N, metastatic tumour tissue samples obtained from axillary
  lymph nodes of patients with primary infiltrating duct carcinoma of the breast compared
  with normal breast tissue samples.

  prognostic factors of primary and metastatic breast cancer.
