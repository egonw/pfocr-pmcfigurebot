caption: 'SMAR1 expression upon LPS treatment after inhibiting TLR4 signaling and
  its downstream pathways. Western blot analysis showing SMAR1 expression upon (A)
  inhibiting TLR4 pathway using TAK‐242 (5 μm) in the absence and presence of LPS
  (1 μg·mL−1) treatment in HCT116 cell line. Only LPS treatment condition was used
  as positive control. Total and phospho‐p65 were used as positive control (B) Real‐time
  analysis was carried out to check the transcript levels of SMAR1 in HCT116 cell
  line upon inhibiting TLR4 pathway. Next, MyD88‐dependent pathway was inhibited using
  peptide inhibitor against MyD88 (Pepinh‐MYD: 10 μm). (C) SMAR1 expression was checked
  by western blotting, where pJNK/JNK was used as positive control to track the activation
  of MyD88 pathway. (D) Real‐time quantification of SMAR1 transcript was also done
  upon inhibition of MyD88 pathway. TRIF‐dependent pathway was inhibited using BX‐795
  (10 μm). (E) Expression of SMAR1 was observed using western blot and (F) real‐time
  PCR upon inhibiting TRIF‐dependent pathway. TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) also uses TRIF‐dependent
  pathway to relay the downstream signals. (G) Western blot showing the expression
  of SMAR1 upon Poly(I:C) treatment, where the expression of p‐IRF3 was used as positive
  control. (H) Transcript levels of SMAR1 after Poly(I:C) treatment in HCT116 cell
  line. β‐Actin was used as an endogenous loading control in all the western blots.
  The values below the blot represent the fold change relative to control, which was
  calculated after normalization with β‐actin. Relative fold change for all the real‐time
  quantitation was calculated using 18S rRNA. Data shown are representative of three
  independent experiments. Error bars indicate that all the values are mean ± SD,
  where *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01(one‐way ANOVA, Bonferroni post‐tests).'
