caption: 'The expression pattern of BLVRB in cholangiocarcinoma. A. Hierarchical clustering
  of differentially expressed mRNAs from 11 paired tissue samples from cholangiocarcinoma
  (CCA) patients. B. The mRNA expression level of BLVRB in 11 paired tissue samples.
  BLVRB levels were lower in tumor tissues than in peritumoral normal tissues. ***P
  < 0.001. C. Negative staining of BLVRB in CCA (lower, red arrows) and positive staining
  of BLVRB in matched peritumor tissue (upper, green arrows). Scale bar: 200 µm. D.
  The BLVRB score was lower in tumor tissues than in peritumoral normal tissues. ***P
  < 0.001. E. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that OS rates were significantly higher
  in patients with high levels of BLVRB expression than in patients with low levels
  of BLVRB expression (P = 0.021). F. Representative immunostaining images of BLVRB
  in CCA without lymph node metastasis and with lymph node metastasis. Scale bar:
  200 µm. G. The BLVRB score in tumor tissues of patients without lymph node metastasis
  and with lymph node metastasis. The BLVRB scores were lower in patients with lymph
  node metastasis than in patients without lymph node metastasis.'
