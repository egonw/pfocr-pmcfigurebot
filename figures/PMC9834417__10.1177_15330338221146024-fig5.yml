caption: Rhoa G17E and active Vav1 interacted through direct binding and induced cancer
  invasion via matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). (A) Binding of Vav1 to RhoA G17E
  detected by immunoprecipitation. Phosphorylated Vav1 was specifically immunoprecipitated
  with RhoA G17E but not with RhoA WT. (B) Expression of proteins related to the RhoA-ROCK
  pathway after treatment with Vav1 shRNA. The expression of ROCK and phosphorylated
  cofilin was unchanged after Vav1 knockdown. (C) Enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and
  MMP-9 were examined by gelatin zymography. Expression of MMP-9 was elevated by RhoA
  G17E gene transduction; this effect was abolished by knockdown of Vav1. MMP-2 expression
  showed no change. (D) Expression of proteins related to the MAPK pathway, which
  is thought to be downstream of Vav1, after treatment with Vav1 shRNA, was reduced
  in RhoA G17E mutant-containing cells compared to that in WT RhoA-containing cells;
  this reduction was unaffected by knockdown of Vav1.
