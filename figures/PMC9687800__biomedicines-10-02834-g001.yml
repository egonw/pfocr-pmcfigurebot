caption: Hippo YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in early PCa. When the Hippo pathway is switched
  ON, phosphorylation of Mst1 and Lats1 by Merlin and MAPK leads to phosphorylation
  of YAP/TAZ that forms a complex with 14–3–3 protein in the cytoplasm. VGLL4 binds
  to TEAD binding promoters thus, blocking the expression of genes important for proliferation,
  migration and tumorigenesis. In the OFF condition, in early prostate tumor cells,
  Lats1/2 is dephosphorylated due to various mechanisms such as degradation of Mst1/2
  by Hsp27, complex formation of Lats1/2 with Par3 and Merlin and dissociation of
  Lats1/2 and KIBRA complex by Par3. Due to blocking of physiological kinase cascade
  of the Hippo pathway, unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ enters the nucleus and act as co-regulator
  of TEAD transcription factors leading to expression of target genes.
