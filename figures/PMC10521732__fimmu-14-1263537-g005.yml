caption: The difference in immune-related characteristics between high- and low-risk
  score groups. (A) Differences in pathway activities scored by GSVA between high-
  and low-risk score groups. The red fonts emphasize the downregulated immune response-related
  pathways in patients with high-risk score. (B) Differences in immune cell infiltration
  between high- and low-risk score groups. The red fonts represent enhanced infiltration
  of immunosuppressive cells and decreased infiltration of tumor-killing immune cells,
  such as CD8+ T cell and B cell in the high-risk group. ‘*’ indicates P -value ≤
  0.05, ‘**’ indicates P-value ≤ 0.01, ‘***’ indicates P-value ≤ 0.001. (C) Differences
  in tumor mutation burden between high- and low-risk score groups. (D) Differences
  in expression of known immune checkpoint genes between high- and low-risk score
  groups. (E) Correlation of risk score genes with immune cell infiltration.
