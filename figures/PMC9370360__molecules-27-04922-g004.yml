caption: 'RAGE-related signaling pathways in Alzheimer’s disease. After APP is converted
  to Aβ, on the one hand, it combines with RAGE to activate the downstream MAPK/NF-κB
  pathway to release inflammatory factors and damages nerve cells. On the other hand,
  Aβ binds to RAGE on the surface of BBB cells, causing ERS, altering the permeability
  of the BBB, increasing the concentration of Aβ in the central nervous system, and
  aggravating AD-related symptoms. Abbreviations: APP: amyloid prebiotic protein;
  Aβ: amyloid β-protein; RAGE: receptor for advanced glycation end products; GSK-3β:
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PERK: protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase;
  eIF2α: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; NOX: nitrogen oxide; NF-κB:
  nuclear factor kappa-B; IκB: inhibitor of NF-κB; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α;
  IL-1β: interleukin-1β; IL-6: interleukin-6; M-CSF: macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor.'
