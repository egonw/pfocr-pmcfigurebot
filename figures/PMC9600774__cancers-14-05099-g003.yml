caption: Compound C inhibits OvCa cell migration and matrix invasiveness. (A) Gene
  set enrichment analysis showing inhibition of EMT signature in CC-treated SKOV3
  cells. (B) CC inhibits OvCa cells migration and (C) invasion. Bars represent mean 
  ±  SEM of migrated and invaded cells counted in 6 high power fields (200× magnifications,
  n = 3/experimental condition, repeated twice). p-value using Student’s t-test.
