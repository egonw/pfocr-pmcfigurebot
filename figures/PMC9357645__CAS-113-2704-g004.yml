caption: Depletion of CD73 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of head and neck
  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in vivo. A, General images of subcutaneous
  tumors of lenti‐shNC– or lenti‐shCD73–transfected CAL27 cells from a xenograft nude
  mouse model. B, Volume of tumors in lenti‐shNC or lenti‐shCD73 groups at indicated
  time. E, The weights of the tumors are measured. D‐F, White light and H&E staining
  images of pulmonary metastasis of lenti‐shNC– or lenti‐shCD73–transfected CAL27
  cells from a lung metastasis model. The number of metastases and weight of the metastatic
  lung were measured. G, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of Ki67, E‐cadherin,
  vimentin, and NWASP. H, The protein expression of Ki67, E‐cadherin, vimentin, and
  NWASP was measured. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
