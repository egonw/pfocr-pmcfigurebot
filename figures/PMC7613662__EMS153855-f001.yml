figure_title: Mucosal antibody secretion and small intestinal IgA+ Plasma Cell activity
  exhibit diurnal rhythmicity
caption: A) Serial fecal sampling of C57BL/6 mice at five 6 hour intervals over a
  circadian day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18, 0), n=10 (pooled from two independent data sets).
  Data representative of at least 4 independent experiments. B) Exemplar flow plots
  of small intestinal CD138+ IgA+ PC, pregated as Live CD45+CD3-CD5-NK1.1-MHCII+/-B220-IgD-,
  at ZT0 and ZT12 and C) Quantification of IgA+ plasma cell frequencies at ZT0, 6,
  12 and 18. B+C n=5 and representative of three independent experiments. D) Ex vivo
  secretion of IgA by sort-purified IgA+ PC (from ZT0 and ZT12) cultured for 18 hours.
  Data pooled from two independent experiments, n=8. E) Heatmap of significantly oscillatory
  genes (JTK Cycle, p<0.01) identified from bulk RNA Sequencing of sort-purified small
  intestinal IgA+ PC taken at ZT0, 6, 12 and 18, z-score of average relative gene
  expression (fpkm) values of n=5 per timepoint. F) GO-Term pathway enrichment analysis
  on oscillatory gene signatures. Selected relative expression (fpkm) values for oscillatory
  gene signatures related to G) Plasma Cell function, survival and identitity, H)
  Extrinsic survival and antibody secretion signals, and I) Cellular Metabolism, values
  representative of n=5 per timepoint. P values were determined using JTK Cycle, with
  the exception of panel D which was determined via a parametric, unpaired t-test.
  All data shown as +/- SEM, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, **** p< 0.0001.
