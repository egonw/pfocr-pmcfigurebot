caption: 'Effects of metformin on the induction of inflammation in ox-LDL-treated
  macrophages. (A) Western blot analysis indicating the expression levels of caspase-1,
  IL-1β and NLRP3 following the indicated treatments; GAPDH was used as a control
  for the standardization of the total cellular protein. (B) Quantitative analysis
  of caspase-1 levels. (C) Quantitative analysis of IL-1β levels. (D) Quantitative
  analysis of NLRP3 levels. (E) The expression levels of the cytokine IL-1β were measured
  in cell culture supernatants by ELISA. (F) The expression levels of the cytokine
  IL-18 were measured in the cell culture supernatants by ELISA. The data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation and are representative of three independent experiments.
  ***P<0.001 vs. the PMA group, #P<0.05 vs. the ox-LDL group, ##P<0.01 vs. the ox-LDL
  group and ###P<0.001 vs. the ox-LDL group. ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  NLRP3, NOD-like receptor protein 3; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
