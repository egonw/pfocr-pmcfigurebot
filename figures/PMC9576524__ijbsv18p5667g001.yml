caption: Gαi3 overexpression in cervical cancer is correlated with poor overall survival.
  TCGA cohorts plus GTEx database revealed Gαi3 transcripts in 306 cases of cervical
  cancer tissues (“Tumor”) and 13 cases of normal epithelial tissues (“Normal”) (A).
  TCGA cervical cancer cohorts (CESC) showed the Kaplan Meier Survival curve of Gαi3-low
  (in blue) and Gαi3-high (in red) cervical cancer patients (B and C). The subgroup
  analyses of Gαi3 mRNA expression and clinical characteristics of cervical patients
  in TCGA cervical cancer cohorts (CESC) were shown (D and E). Nomogram for high Gαi3
  expression in predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival probability of cervical
  cancer patients was shown (F and G). The volcano map of differentially expressed
  gene (DEGs) based on Gαi3 expression in TCGA cervical cancer cohorts (CESC) was
  shown (H); KEGG pathway analysis of Gαi3-associated DEGs and enriched pathways were
  presented (I). ***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05; “N. S.” means P > 0.05.
