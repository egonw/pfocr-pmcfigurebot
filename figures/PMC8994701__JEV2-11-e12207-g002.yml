caption: 'Quantitative proteomics of PLX secretome fractions. (a) Heatmap comparing
  the proteome of soluble factor factors (sol. F.) and EVTFF2 with human platelet
  lysate‐supplemented defibrinised unconditioned cell culture medium (α‐MEM). (b)
  Volcano plot comparing protein expression signal significance to levels of enrichment
  in sol. F. vs. EVTFF2. Functional categories according to corresponding GO terms
  as listed in Table  are depicted by color‐coded dots as indicated; additional highly
  over‐represented proteins marked as open circles (see also Figure S6). (c) Pathway
  enrichment analysis for significantly differentially detected proteins (n = 814,
  adjusted p < 0.05). Enriched proteins (n = 118) and corresponding WIKI pathways
  highlighted in the same colour. Proteins most significantly (absolute log2‐fold‐change > 1)
  enriched in soluble factors (bottom left; n = 10) and proteins enriched in the EVTFF2
  fractions (top; n = 47) shown. Proteins found in several pathways are shown with
  one bar with different corresponding colour codes. The remaining differentially
  detected proteins are highlighted as grey barcode on the bottom (category ‘others’;
  n = 696). Abbreviations: Net., network; path., pathway; sign., signalling'
