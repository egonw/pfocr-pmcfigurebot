caption: Simplified schema illustrating lower environmental light exposures (left
  panel) via retino-hypothalamic neuronal projections to the SCN in the brain elicit
  lower circadian amplitude of rest-activity cycles and probably other circadian rhythms
  and a consequently lower specific antibody production as it is for example known
  in night shift workers (). The same potential pathway of action is shown on the
  right panel but for higher light exposures, which results in higher antibody responses.
  The question marks illustrate the hypothesised open research questions.

  response to influenza vaccination in patients with dementia.
