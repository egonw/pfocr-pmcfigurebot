caption: 'Curcumin activates the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibited by DHEA in ovary tissues
  of PCOS-like rats. (a–d) Sections of ovarian tissues were immunostained for revealing
  p-PI3K/p-AKT (red) as indicated. The slides were counterstained with DAPI (blue),
  and the images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope. (e, f) The
  protein expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT in ovarian tissues was assessed
  with western blotting. Representative data are displayed, and the relative protein
  intensity of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT was normalized to GAPDH. Three independent
  experiments were performed with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM.
  ∗∗p < 0.05 vs. control group; ##p < 0.05 vs. PCOS group.'
