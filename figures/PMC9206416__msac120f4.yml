caption: Differentially activated pathways in highlanders. (A) Activation of the TCA
  cycle in Tibetans only (left) and activated oxidative phosphorylation in both ImHan
  and Tibetans (right). Several rate-limiting enzymes from the TCA cycle were up-regulated
  in Tibetans. (B) Activation of the antioxidant-associated genes in ImHan and Tibetans.
  The upper row shows the expression of three genes as ROS markers, and the lower
  row lists the expression of three antioxidant-associated genes. (C) Autophagy was
  activated in Tibetans only, and proteasome was activated in both ImHan and Tibetans.
  (D) Highly expressed autophagy-associated genes in Tibetans. The expression of three
  autophagy marker genes is indicated in the upper row. The lower row shows three
  autophagy genes mediated by calcium signaling that were highly expressed in Tibetans.
  (E) A proposed model of the signaling cascades granting successful reproductions
  in two groups of highlanders. These cascades are illustrated in the bio-processes
  of energy metabolism (green square), angiogenesis (pink square), and antioxidant-related
  pathways (blue square, see text). Significantly up-regulated genes and pathways
  are highlighted with a blue (Tibetans only), pink (ImHan only), or purple (ImHan
  and Tibetans) frame. The gray frame shows the pathway without significant expression
  changes. Asterisks mark the genes and pathways that contain Tibetan-specific genetic
  variants as shown by previous studies as well as our recent results (data not shown).
