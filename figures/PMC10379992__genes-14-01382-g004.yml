caption: Overlapped and unique signaling pathways associated with DEGs on the dorsolateral
  areas of the frontal cortex of rats 4.5 h after tMCAO. The pathway enrichment analysis
  of DEGs in the IR vs. SH, IS vs. IR, and IA vs. IR pairwise comparisons was carried
  out according to DAVID (2021 Update). (a) Schematic comparison of DEG-related annotations
  obtained in the three IR vs. SH, IS vs. IR, and IA vs. IR pairwise comparisons using
  a Venn diagram. The number of annotations is indicated using numbers on the chart
  segments. (bâ€“d) The most significant pathways among the annotations in each comparison
  group and the corresponding Padj values, as well as the number of upregulated (green)
  and downregulated (red) DEGs in the three pairwise comparisons IR vs. SH (b), IS
  vs. IR (c), and IA vs. IR (d) are presented. Only DEGs and pathways with Padj <
  0.05 were selected for analysis. Each comparison group included 3 animals.
