caption: Effect of caffeine on fibrosis and profibrogenic mediators and MMPs in hepatic
  tissue from the NASH model. (A) Masson’s trichrome staining in hepatic tissues from
  rats in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine, and caffeine groups. Scale
  bars = 200 and 20 μm. (B) Percentages of collagen areas (n = 4). (C) Collagen content
  was determined by measuring the liver hydroxyproline level (n = 6). Activities of
  MMP-9 (F) and MMP-2 (G) were determined using zymography (D) (n = 5). Bars represent
  the mean ± SEM. Values are shown as fold increments in optical density normalized
  to control group values (control = 1). (E) Protein level of MMP-13 was examined
  using western blot analysis (n = 3); β-actin was used as a loading control. Bars
  represent the mean ± SEM. (a) p < 0.05 compared with the control group; (b) p <
  0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4 group.
