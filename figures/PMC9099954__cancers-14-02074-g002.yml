caption: GATA5 overexpression inhibits the proliferation, migration, as well as invasion
  of PCa cells in vitro. (A) The effect of GATA5 overexpression was verified by Western
  blotting analysis. (B) Compared with the pc-vector group, the growth rate in the
  pc-GATA5 group was lower. (C,D) Overexpression of GATA5 suppressed colony formation.
  (E,F) The EdU assay showed that GATA5 overexpression decreased cell proliferation.
  (G,H) The migration capability was assessed through the wound-healing assay. (I,J)
  The invasive property was evaluated using a Transwell invasion assay. Data are presented
  as mean Â± SD of at least three experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
