caption: 'Biological activity of ABPP probes BP-1–BP-5. (A) Outline of the ABPP strategy
  for the target identification of small molecule probes in the live cells. After
  probes binding to their protein targets, a click reaction was performed to ligate
  a fluorophore or enrichment tag, such as biotin, to the probe. Enriched proteins
  were subsequently analyzed using Western blot or mass spectrometry. (B) Structures
  of ABPP probes BP-1–BP-5 and their anti-proliferation potential towards CRMM2 cells
  based on CCK-8 assay (n = 3). (C) In gel fluorescence of active probe BP-2, inactive
  BP-4 and medium probes BP-1, BP-3 and BP-5, labelled CRMM2 proteome. Probe labelled
  proteins were ligated to TAMRA, separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by in gel fluorescence
  (n = 3). (D) BP-2 shows concentration-dependent labelling of protein targets. (E)
  Live cell imaging of CRMM2 cells with BP-2/BP-4, followed by cell fixation, permeabilization,
  click chemistry with TAMRA-N3, then image acquisition (n = 10). Blue: DAPI nuclear
  stain; red: TAMRA channel. Scale bar: 25 μm. All data are representative of at least
  three independent experiments.'
