caption: SenALSig-based GSEA of different risk groups. (A) A significant difference
  in gene enrichment in GO was seen in the high expression phenotype of senescence-associated
  lncRNAs, namely GTPase activity, regulation of GTPase activity, positive regulation
  of MAPK cascade, negative regulation of cytokine production, and positive regulation
  of cell projection organization pathway. The low expression phenotype was observed
  to be enriched for five GO terms, namely mitochondrial gene expression, cytoplasmic
  translation, mitochondrial translation, ribosome assembly, and mitochondrial protein
  containing complex. (B) Five KEGG items, namely the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the
  calcium signaling pathway, and the focal adhesion signaling pathway, were significantly
  differentially enriched in the high expression phenotype. Five KEGG items, namely
  citrate-tricarboxylic acid cycle, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, oxidative phosphorylation,
  ribosome, and aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, showed significantly differential enrichment
  in the low expression phenotype based on the normalized enrichment score, nominal
  p value, and false discovery rate q value. SenALSig, senescence-associated lncRNAs;
