caption: Effects of RG–RS (SAL) at concentrations of 20 μg/mL, RG at concentrations
  of 10 μg/mL (HRG1), white ginseng (WG), and ginsenosides Rb1, Rg3, Rg5, Rk1 at the
  concentration of 0.1 μM on selected canonical pathways. The violet color shows the
  p-value (calculated using a Right-Tailed Fisher’s Exact Test), indicating the statistical
  significance of the overlap of analyzed dataset genes within the pathway; the intensity
  of color corresponds to the log p-value in a scale from 0 to 2.2 (upper panel).
  The brown color shows the predicted activation, and the blue color shows the predicted
  inhibition of signaling pathways; the intensity of the color corresponds to the
  activation zone on a scale from −3.153 to +2.324 (upper panel). symbol · shows that
  the activation z-score was < 2 and the −log p-value <1.3 = p < 0.05. An absolute
  z-score ≥2 is considered significant activation (+) or inhibition (-). The activation
  z-score predicts the activation state of the canonical pathway using the gene expression
  patterns of the genes within the pathway.
