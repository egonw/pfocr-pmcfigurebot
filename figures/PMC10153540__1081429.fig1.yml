caption: Pirtobrutinib, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib inhibit platelet signaling and
  function in vitro and ex vivo. (A) Schematic diagram depicting an abridged platelet
  GPVI signaling pathway in which stimulation of GPVI results in activation of SFK
  and BTK/TEC followed by PLCy2 which enables cytosolic Ca2+ release and activation
  of PKC. Subsequent activation of integrin aIIbb3 enables fibrinogen binding and
  platelet aggregation. (Bi) Western blot analysis of Src Y418 phosphorylation with
  GAPDH loading control following stimulation of washed platelets with 3 mg/mL collagen-related
  peptide (CRP-XL) for 3 minutes in the presence of a range of concentrations of pirtobrutinib,
  acalabrutinib and ibrutinib (30-0.03 mM) or vehicle and (Bii) graph of mean phosphorylation
  relative to vehicle treated samples. (Ci) Cytosolic Ca2+ levels after stimulation
  of fura-2 loaded platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with 3 mg/mL CRP-XL in the presence
  of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) and (Cii) graphs of mean increase in
  fura-2 signal relative to vehicle-treated samples and (Ciii) log-half maximal inhibitory
  concentration (IC50) values for the BTKi. (Di) Graph of % aggregation of PRP measured
  by PBA after stimulation with 3 mg/mL CRP-XL for 5 minutes in the presence of BTKi
  and (Dii) mean log-IC50 values. Aggregation of PRP from patients receiving BTKi
  therapy measured in 96-well plates following stimulation with concentration ranges
  of (A) CRP-XL, (B) collagen. Plots of (i) concentration-response curves for each
  agonist in which points represent the mean response to each concentration ± standard
  error of the mean and (ii) scatter plots of half maximal effective concentration
  (EC50) values, bars represent the mean ± standard deviation. Failure to induce concentration-dependent
  aggregation was designated ‘No Response’. The proportion of non-responders is noted
  at the top of relevant scatter plots. Statistical comparisons were performed by
  two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test. *P<0.05, **P<0.01.
