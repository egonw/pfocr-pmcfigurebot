figure_title: PCK2 coexpresses with breast tumor carcinoma epithelial markers; implications
  for a role of entosis and PEPCK-M pathway in tumor growth and cancer survival
caption: A PCK2 transcript expression on Agilent Gene Chip data obtained from “Normal”
  (GTEX database) breast tissue and Primary tumors from Yau 2010 study comprising
  clinical, Agilent Gene Chip gene expression data from datasets GSE2034, GSE5327,
  GSE7390 and NKI295, TPM units, Agilent normalized gene expression Z-score. Welch’s
  corrected t-test using Xena from UCSC Welch’s t-test (p = 2.370E-8; t = −6.234).
  B PEPCK-M protein content was probed on a tumor microarray panel containing normal
  and breast carcinoma sections, using a primary antibody against PEPCK-M and developed
  using DAB peroxidase. C PCK2 mRNA expression data from the Metabric human breast
  carcinoma clinical dataset [] were ranked at Z-score > 1.5 (PCK2 High) and <−1.5
  (PCK2 Low) and interrogated for molecular subtype and 3-gene classifier distribution.
  D Kaplan–Meier distant metastasis-free survival probability plot indicating the
  effect of PCK2 gene expression on survival of tumor patients filtered for clinically
  relevant marker subtypes (Clusters 2 and 4 from the 306 geneset analysis , mostly
  comprising hormone receptor positive tumors of the Luminal subtype and epithelial
  lineages). The Median gene expression was used to split samples on High and Low
  cut-off. Log-rank test was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR), Chi2 and significance
  (Chi2 = 11.70, p = 0.0006250; HR = 1.921), using built-in statistical package at
  Xena UCSC. E Gene expression correlation matrix between PCK2 and several markers
  of epithelial (KRT18, KRT8, KRT19, EPCAM) and mesenchymal (SERPINE1, VIM, TWIST1,
  SMAI1), and E-cadherin (CDH1) preferentially expressed in the epithelial lineage
  and required for entosis to proceed, and N-cadherin (CDH2), expressed upon a switch
  to mesenchymal lineage normally involving the corresponding loss of the E-cadherin
  isoform. Human breast carcinoma clinical samples were queried, and the raw expression
  data was downloaded prior to statistical analysis from gene expression data comprising
  datasets GSE2034, GSE5327, GSE7390 and NKI295 []. Pearson correlation and p-value
  for each pair set is indicated in the plot. F Role of PEPCK-M in the formation of
  glycosyl moieties for glycosylation of proteins during nutrient stress and the activation
  of cell-in-cell engulfing.
