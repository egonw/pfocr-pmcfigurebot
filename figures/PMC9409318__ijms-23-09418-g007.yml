caption: 'Burn injury induces significant alterations in peripheral immunometabolic
  canonical immune and metabolic signaling pathways compared to healthy controls.
  mRNA was isolated from PBMC, which was isolated from burn patients or healthy controls,
  and gene expression was evaluated using nanostring barcoding (nCounter Human Immune
  Profiling PanCancer CodeSet; 770 genes, and the Human Metabolic Gene CodeSet; 768
  genes). Fold changes were generated utilizing nSolver v4.0 and R, and significantly
  altered (p < 0.05) gene expression data versus healthy controls were plotted on
  a canonical pathway schematic for specific mTOR, TLR, and NFκB pathways. Key: *,
  resolved expression value from duplicate entries in the dataset in Figure; A, activating
  relationship; C, causation; CP, chemical-protein interaction; E, expression; I,
  inhibition; L, molecular cleavage; P, (de)phosphorylation; PD, protein-DNA binding;
  PP, protein-protein binding; RB, regulation of binding.'
