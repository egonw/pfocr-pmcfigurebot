caption: PRMT7 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration. A The knockdown
  and overexpression efficiency of the PRMT7 was detected by western blot and RT-qPCR.
  B CCK-8 assays were performed to compare experimental groups with the si-NC group,
  and PRMT7 downregulation promoted cell growth, while PRMT7 overexpression did not.
  C Colony formation experiments were performed and the number of colonies in the
  experimental group was compared to that in the si-NC group, and PRMT7 downregulation
  promoted cell proliferation, while PRMT7 overexpression did not. D Transwell experiments
  were performed to determine the migration of experimental cells compared to that
  of the si-NC group cells, and PRMT7 downregulation promoted cell migration, while
  PRMT7 overexpression did not. E Effects of low/high PRMT7 expression on the expression
  of proliferation- and migration-related proteins were analyzed by western blot and
  quantified based on relative grey values. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
