caption: Injection of murine tumors with RNAs encoding 4 cytokines leads to in vivo
  translation and induction of a local and systemic tumor-specific immune response,
  mediating regression of both injected and distant tumors. Immune responses are comprised
  of several immune cell populations including T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and
  Natural Killer (NK) cells. Anti-tumor activity is dependent on the IFN-Î³ pathway,
  consistent with a key role for IL-12sc in the cytokine mixture, and tumor antigen-specific
  T cells are expanded intratumorally.
