caption: Co-occurrence of eukaryotes and bacteria, and detected protein groups of
  Desulfobacterota. (A) A network analysis of 18S rRNA (squares) and 16S rRNA (circles)
  gene ASV co-occurrences resulted in two major network modules containing diatom
  [I] and dinoflagellate [II] 18S ASVs, respectively, as well as one mixed module
  [III]. The network was calculated based on Spearman correlations (r >0.7, p < 0.01)
  exclusively between 18S ASVs and 16S ASVs. Desulfobacterota (yellow circles) were
  only associated with the diatom-dominated module I. The sizes of the symbols correspond
  to the number of significant correlations of the nodes (degree). (B) The bacterial
  taxa co-occurring with diatoms and dinoflagellates, respectively, are displayed
  as horizontal bars with a length proportional to the number of ASVs belonging to
  each lineage. Desulfobacterota (yellow) as well as potentially sulfur-oxidizing
  Ectothiorodospiraceae (Gammaproteobacteria, blue) were positively associated with
  diatoms but not with dinoflagellates. (C) The pie chart displays relative abundances
  for all 19 protein groups classified as belonging to Desulfobacterota during all
  three time points sampled for metaproteomics. Of these, seven protein groups (32%,
  bright yellow) represented enzymes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction.
  Yellow circles indicate which of the key enzymes in this metabolic pathway were
  detected.
