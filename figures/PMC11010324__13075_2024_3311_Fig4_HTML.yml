caption: Cell‒cell interaction analysis revealed a significant Galectin-9 signaling
  pathway of macrophages in the immune micromilieu of lupus nephritis (LN). (A) Dot
  plot showing the signaling patterns of macrophages and other immune cells. The dot
  size is proportional to the contribution score computed in pattern recognition analysis.
  A higher contribution score implies that the signaling pathway is more enriched
  in the corresponding cell group. Enriched LGALS9 signaling was observed to be the
  most significant beside the MHC-I-CD8 and MHC-II-CD4 interactions. (B) The immunofluorescence
  study confirmed the predicted upregulation of LGALS9 in CD68 + macrophages in LN.
  The LN immunofluorescence images in this figure are from a 37-year-old woman with
  3-year duration of LN disease, which was stage II (LN patient 3 in Supplementary
  Table )
