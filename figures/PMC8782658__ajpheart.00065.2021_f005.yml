caption: 'TNF-α leads to PKCζ S-nitrosylation, PKCζ activation, association with ICAM-1,
  and ICAM-1 phosphorylation. A: confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated
  with 1 nM TNF-α for different times. Cell lysates were obtained and processed by
  biotin switch to detect S-nitrosylated ICAM-1. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test, n
  = 3 independent experiments. B: confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated
  with 1 nM TNF-α for 5 min in the presence or absence of 300 µM l-NMA for 1 h. Cell
  lysates were obtained and processed to detect S-nitrosylated PKCζ by biotin switch.
  C: depletion of eNOS in EAHy926 cells abrogates PKCζ S-nitrosylation induced by
  TNF-α. EAHy926 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA served as a control. Western
  blot for eNOS confirms protein depletion. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison
  test, n = 3 independent experiments; *P < 0.05 in comparison to control (C), #P
  < 0.05 in comparison to TNF-α treatment in the absence of eNOS siRNA. Data were
  normalized at band intensity seen at control without eNOS siRNA treatment. Confluent
  monolayers of EAhy926 cells were incubated with 1 nM TNF-α for 5 min in the presence
  or absence of 300 µM l-NMA for 1 h. Cell lysates were obtained and processed to
  detect phosphorylated p-PKCζ by Western blot analysis (D) and interaction between
  ICAM-1 and PKCζ by immunoprecipitation (E). Two-way ANOVA and Holm–Sidak test, *P
  < 0.05 in comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison to the treatment with TNF-α;
  n = 3 independent experiments. All data were normalized at band intensity seen at
  time 0. F: ICAM-Y512 by Western blot analysis. Two-way ANOVA and Holm–Sidak test,
  *P < 0.05 in comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison to the treatment with
  TNF-α; n = 4 independent experiments. G: ICAM-1 Thr phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation
  with anti ICAM-1 antibody, followed by Western blot analysis against p-Thr. Two-way
  ANOVA and Holm–Sidak test, *P < 0.05 in comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison
  to the treatment with TNF-α; n = 3 independent experiments. Data were normalized
  at band intensity seen at time 0. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ICAM-1,
  intercellular adhesion molecule 1; l-NMA, NG-methyl-l-arginine; PKCζ, protein kinase
  Cζ; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.'
