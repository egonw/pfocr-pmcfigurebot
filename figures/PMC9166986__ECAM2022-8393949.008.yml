caption: 'Effect of TSC on the expression of SFRP4 protein and mRNA in FLS of AA rats.
  (a) The change in SFRP4 protein expression was observed by immunofluorescence analysis
  (×200): (A) normal group, (B) model group, (C) TSC group, (D) TSC + lncRNA OIP5-AS1
  siRNA group, (E) lncRNA OIP5-AS1 siRNA group, and (F) the lncRNA OIP5-AS1 siRNA + NC
  group. (b) The change in SFRP4 mRNA expression was observed by RT-qPCR. (c) The
  change in SFRP4 protein expression was observed by Western blotting. (d) Semiquantitative
  analysis of SFRP4 protein expression. ##P < 0.01 compared with the normal group;
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the model group.'
