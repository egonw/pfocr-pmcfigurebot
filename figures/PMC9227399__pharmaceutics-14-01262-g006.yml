caption: (A) Snapshot of the two different assays used by Raikkonen and Benzaid, from
  which we have extracted data to formulate our mathematical models. On the left is
  shown the continuous assay in which tumor cells underwent treatment for the whole
  time of the experiment. On the right is shown the pulse experiment performed by
  both authors with two different tumor target cells (MCF7, T27D); in this case, the
  drug was removed after 1 h via medium replacement. In the central part of the figure,
  we represented zoledronic acid (ZA) pharmacodynamics and IPP into the tumor cells.
  All process steps are characterized by the calculated parameters in Models 1 and
  2. ZA inhibits FPP synthase in the mevalonate pathway through a conformational change
  in the enzyme. A second conformational change, after the binding of the second substrate,
  forms a tightly bound inhibition complex that provides a further stabilisation of
  the FPPS and ZA complex, resulting in the IPP accumulation. The extracellular and
  intracellular compartments were defined through the cellular borderline. The ZA
  concentration is proportional to the observations by GS-MS in the intracellular
  compartment. In each well, the surnatant volume was the extracellular compartment.
  (B) Impact of ZA concentration and exposure time of tumor cells on V T cell immune
  response. In this cartoon, a patient is represented during intravenous ZA infusion,
  and the possible effects on his tumor cells localised in the gut are also represented.
  We aim to translate the knowledge acquired by our models on in vitro cell experiments
  onto patients by focusing on the events occurring in tumor cells upon long treatment
  of ZA. Finally, we show that IPP accumulation acts on the activation and proliferation
  of  T cells, promoting their anti-tumoral function. (C) Illustration of the inhibition
  mechanism of ZA on FPP synthase determined by a conformational change of enzyme.
  The first conformation shows in the a pocket site the Mg involved in the ZA binding.
  After this opened conformation follows a partially closed conformation, in which
  the catalytic site is occupied by ZA. The last conformation is the most stable thank
  to the IPP binding that determines the closed and inactive function of the enzyme
  [,].
