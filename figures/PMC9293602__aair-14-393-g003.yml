figure_title: MetaboAnalyst pathway Impact based on selected and more representative
  metabolites responsible for the class separation in sputum samples in different
  inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and healthy subjects. (A) Asthma and healthy;
  (B) EA and NA; (C) EA and PGA; (D) NA and PGA. Circles represent metabolic pathways
  potentially involved in class separation. EA, eosinophilic asthma; NA, neutrophilic
  asthma; PGA, paucigranulocytic asthma
