caption: Apigenin promotes recovery and alleviates scar formation after spinal cord
  injury in mice. (A) BMS scores indicate the motor functional index over 28 days
  after SCI (n = 6). (B) Sections of injured spinal cord were stained with H&E (Scale
  bar = 50 μm). (C) The expression of CSPG was detected by tissue immunofluorescence
  (upper Scale bar = 50 μm, lower Scale bar = 25 μm). (D) α‐SMA was detected by tissue
  immunochemistry (Scale bar = 50 μm), and the analysis of positive areas is shown
  in (E). (ns means p > 0.05; * means p < 0.05; ** means p < 0.01; *** means p < 0.001;
  **** means p < 0.0001, p values of (A) were analyzed by two‐way analysis of variance, and p
  values of (E) were calculated with one‐way anova, both p valuesfollowed by Bonferroni's
  multiple comparison test. n = 3)
