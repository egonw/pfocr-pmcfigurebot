caption: The MAPK and related pathways in thyroid cancer. Shown in the (middle) of
  the figure is the classical MAPK pathway leading from an extracellular mitogenic
  stimulus that activates a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) in the cell membrane, to
  RAS, RAF (shown as BRAF-V600E), MEK and ERK. ERK enters the nucleus where it upregulates
  tumor-promoting genes and downregulates tumor suppressor genes and thyroid iodide-handling
  genes. On the (left) side of the figure is the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway,
  in which extracellular stimuli activate the pathway, leading to activation of the
  inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK), resulting in the phosphorylation of IκB. IκB
  becomes dissociated from NF-κB and then enters the nucleus to promote the expression
  of tumor-promoting genes. Through an undefined mechanism, BRAF-V600E promotes the
  phosphorylation of IκB and the release of NF-κB, thus activating the NF-κB pathway.
  Shown on the (right) side of the figure is the RASSF1–mammalian STE20-like protein
  kinase 1 (MST1)–forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) pathway. Activated by extracellular pro-apoptotic
  stimuli, RASSF1A activates MST1which phosphorylates FOXO3. The resulting phosphorylated
  FOXO3 becomes dissociated from 14-3-3 proteins and enters the nucleus to promote
  the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the FOXO pathway. BRAF-V600E directly inhibits
  MST1 and prevents its activation by RASSF1A, thereby suppressing the pro-apoptotic
  signaling of the FOXO3 pathway. The downward arrow for the FOXO activities shown
  in the nucleus indicates this negative effect of BRAF-V600E on pro-apoptotic genes.
