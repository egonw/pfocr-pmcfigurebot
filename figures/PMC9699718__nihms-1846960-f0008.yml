  ACC-4-mediated neuronal signal regulates immune activation during intestinal distension.
  Infection by S. aureus leads to intestinal distension and induces cholinergic neuron
  release of acetylcholine. The acetylcholine-gated chloride channel ACC-4 functions
  in RIM to activate Wnt signaling and a broad innate immune response.
