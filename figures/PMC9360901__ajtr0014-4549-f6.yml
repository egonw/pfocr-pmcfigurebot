caption: 'UBE2L3 is dependent on elevated Snail to enhance migration and invasion
  of LUAD cells. A. The efficiency of Snail knockdown in H1299 cells was assessed
  by immunoblotting. B. Representative images of wound healing assays and the percentage
  of wound closure were quantified. H1299 cells were co-transfected with the UBE2L3
  expression vector and Snail shRNA or control shRNA. Snail knockdown suppressed the
  cell migration induced by UBE2L3. Magnification: 40× (scar bar =200 μm). C. Cells
  were analyzed by Transwell assays. Magnification: 100× (scar bar =100 μm). D. Knockdown
  of Snail inhibited the lung metastasis induced by UBE2L3 in vivo. Representative
  HE staining of lung metastasis after injection of cancer cells into BALB/c mice
  via the tail vein. Magnification: 100× (scar bar =100 μm). Quantification of lung
  metastasis by section of the whole lung (n=5 mice per group). ***P<0.001.'
