caption: 'SF3B1R625G leads to a decreased expression of metabolic proteins and sensitizes
  cells to serine, glycine and glucose deprivation. (A) Expression of metabolic targets
  involved in serine de novo synthesis, PPP (pentose phosphate pathway), glycolysis
  and OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) upon 3 days of media deprivation in SF3B1WT
  and SF3B1R625G isogenic Mel202 cells by Western blot. β-actin was immunoblotted
  as a control for protein quantity. (B) Cell viability of SF3B1WT and SF3B1R625G
  Mel202 cells upon media starvation (Gal: galactose, Glc: glucose, and SG: serine
  and glycine). The complete media condition was also included (+Glc+SG). Data are
  represented as the mean of triplicates ± SD. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to
  generate the p-values; * p < 0.05; NS: non-significant.'
