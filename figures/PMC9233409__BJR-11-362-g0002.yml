caption: Bone loading-responsive gene set is highly relevant to osteoarthritis (OA).
  a) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of loading responsive gene set in the osteoarthritis
  (OA) medial tibial plateau (MT) and the paired lateral tibial plateau (LT) samples.
  NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate, p-values estimated
  by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg method.
  Leading-edge subset was considered as the main contributing genes to the difference
  between the OA MT and the paired OA LT samples. b) Estimated score calculated by
  single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) algorithm in the OA MT and the paired LT samples. ns,
  not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; all p-values estimated by one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA). c) Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of the persistent genes. GeneRatio indicates the gene
  number ration in each GO term or KEGG pathway. The colour and size of each dot represents
  a p-value adjusted by Benjamini & Hochberg method and gene number assigned to the
  corresponding GO term and KEGG pathway, respectively. d) The top 50 genes in leading-edge
  subset (i) and the essential genes relevant to extracellular matrix (ECM) structural
  constituent (ii), Wnt and transforming growth factor (TGF) signalling pathways (iii),
  and axon guidance (iv). e) Independent dataset validation of some essential genes
  relevant to bone remodelling. OA versus sham; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; all p-values
  estimated by unpaired two-tailed t-test.
