caption: 'Effect of zearalenone (ZEA) on Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
  and the apoptosis rate in porcine endometrial stromal cells. (A). The Ca2+ level
  detected by flow cytometry; (B). The ROS level detected by flow cytometry; (C).
  Effect of ZEA on intracellular Ca2+ level; (D). Effects of ZEA on intracellular
  ROS level; (E). Density maps of the apoptosis rate detected using flow cytometry;
  (F). Effect of ZEA on the apoptosis rate. CON, control; ZEA, cells treated with
  15 μM ZEA; P + Z, cells treated with ZEA and 4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Treatment
  time: 24 h. “**” represents a highly significant difference compared with the control
  group. “##” indicates a highly significant difference compared with the ZEA group.'
