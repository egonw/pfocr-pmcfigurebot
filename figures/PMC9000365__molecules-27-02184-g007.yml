caption: Adenosine A2A and A2B receptor antagonists inhibited adenosine mediated-Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. The luciferase activity in WRHEK293A reporter cells was evaluated after
  treatment with adenosine and NECA for 24 h in the presence/absence of adenosine
  A2A and A2B receptor antagonists, ZM241385 and PSB603, respectively. Both inhibitors
  blocked Wnt/β-catenin reporter activity. The effects of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor
  (KH7), PKA inhibitor (H89), and mTOR inhibitor (LY294002) were also examined. Adenosine-mediated
  Wnt activation was inhibited by KH7, H89, and LY294002. NECA was used as a positive
  control for adenosine A2A and A2B receptor activation. The data represent the means
  of six independent samples. N.T, non-treated control; Significantly different compared
  with N.T (* p < 0.001).
