figure_title: Random forest analysis of metabolic serum datasets
caption: 'Random forest analysis bins individual samples into groups, based on their
  metabolite similarities and variances. Colored dots represent metabolite super pathway
  families. Salmon: amino acids, green: lipids, dark purple: partially characterized
  molecules, blue: unnamed biochemicals, magenta: xenobiotics, brown: carbohydrates,
  turquoise: nucleotides, olive: co-factors and vitamins, yellow: peptides. a The
  biochemical profiles predict the control sample group with a predictive accuracy
  of 93% (control male and female individuals) (top). Random forest analysis shows
  the 30 most important metabolites in the control group (male and female subjects)
  (bottom). b The biochemical profiles predict the COVID-19 sample group with a predictive
  accuracy of 65% (male and female COVID-19 patients) (top). Random forest analysis
  demonstrates top 30 ranking biochemicals of importance, based on male COVID-19 and
  female COVID-19 group separation in serum samples (bottom). c The biochemical profiles
  are highly successful in predicting the male groups correctly with 100% accuracy
  (control and COVID-19 samples) (top). Random forest analysis demonstrates the top
  30 ranking biochemicals of importance, based on control male and COVID-19 male group
  separation in serum samples (bottom). d The biochemical profiles are highly successful
  in predicting the female groups correctly with 98% accuracy (control and COVID-19
  samples) (top). Random forest analysis demonstrates the 30 most important metabolites
  in the female group (control and COVID-19 subjects) (bottom).'
