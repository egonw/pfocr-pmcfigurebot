  of MG pathology
caption: 'Effective neuromuscular transmission through the NMJ interface starts with
  an action potential that depolarizes the presynaptic nerve terminal and causes release
  of ACh quanta into the synaptic cleft. ACh binds to the AChR triggering Na+ influx
  and subsequent muscle contraction. The complex formed by LRP4 and MuSK induces AChR
  clustering mediated by rapsyn, which is required for maintenance of the postsynaptic
  structures in the NMJ. While AChR Abs hinder the neuromuscular transmission through
  direct interruption of AChR signaling, in MuSK MG the Abs disrupt the LRP4-MuSK
  pathway. This leads to diminished AChR clustering and consequently defective signaling.
  Similarly, LRP4 Abs are assumed to interfere with LRP4-MuSK interaction, but conclusive
  evidence is missing. Abs: autoantibodies; ACh: acetylcholine; AChR: acetylcholine
  receptor, LRP4: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4; MG: myasthenia
  gravis; MuSK: muscle-specific tyrosine kinase; NMJ: neuromuscular junction.'
