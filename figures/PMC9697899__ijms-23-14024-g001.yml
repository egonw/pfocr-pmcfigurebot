caption: 'MG alleviates the inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
  (A–D) Effects of different concentrations of MG and SASP on the viability of RAW264.7
  cells. (E,F) Effect of NO production in RAW264.7 cells co-stimulated by MG and LPS
  for 12 h and 24 h. Data were presented as the means ± SEMs of three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. the normal group; ### p < 0.001
  vs. the group treated with only LPS.'
