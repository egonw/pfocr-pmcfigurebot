figure_title: A schematic model of GASP1 promoting malignant phenotypes of breast
  cancer cells and decreasing their response to paclitaxel by forming a positive feedback
  loop with the IGF1/IGF1R pathway
caption: In GASP1-deficient cells, IGF1R stability can be regulated by MDM2-mediated
  ubiquitination degradation. When GASP1 is overexpressed in breast cancer, GASP1
  interacts with and stabilizes IGF1R by preventing the MDM2-mediated IGF1R ubiquitination
  degradation, thereby activating its downstream signaling pathways such as NF-ÎºB,
  PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK pathways. IGF1, in turn, stimulated GASP1 expression by activating
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, forming a vicious cycle propelling the malignant progression
  of breast cancer and decreasing the cellular response to paclitaxel in breast cancer.
