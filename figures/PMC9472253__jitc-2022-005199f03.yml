caption: Imaging of the mechanisms of the CD47-SIRPα pathway in vivo unravels antibody-dependent
  cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). (A) Schematic diagram of intravital imaging procedure
  for imaging the mechanisms of the CD47-SIRPα pathway in vivo using triple-negative
  breast cancer models. (B) Representative images for illustration of the CD47-SIRPα
  pathway. After injection of anti-CD47-AF488 and F4/80-PE, anti-CD47-AF488 mAb (green)
  rapidly targeted NAD(P)Hhicancer cells (blue) indicated by yellow arrows. Engulfment
  of NAD(P)Hhi and CD47-AF488+ cancer cells by F4/80-PE+ macrophages (red) was well
  observed (white arrows) presenting ADCP events. (C) Quantitative co-localization
  analysis using Pearson’s coefficient and Manders’ coefficients further elaborated
  imaging observation. (D, E) ADCP events occurred as rapid but short wave between
  F4/80-PE-labeled macrophages (red) and CD47-AF488 mAb-targeted cells (green). CD47
  inhibitor-treated cancer cells were first overlapped (yellow arrows) with F4/80+
  macrophages and then soon engulfed (white arrows) by the macrophages extensively.
  (F–J) CD47-AF488 mAb-targeted cells (green) depict metabolic phenotype of strong
  NAD(P)H expression (blue), (I) whereas no meaningful co-localization with FADhi
  cells (yellow) (J). Analyses with Peason’s coefficient and Manders’ coefficients
  corroborated imaging results (F–H). (K) Real-time visualization of phagocytosis
  events (white arrows) with treatment of CD47 blockade was also achieved using NAD(P)H
  imaging. Scales, 20 µm. AF, Alexa Flour; CD47, cluster of differentiation 47; FAD,
  flavin adenine dinucleotide; FADhi, cells high in FAD intensity; mAb, monoclonal
  antibody; NAD(P)H, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) hydrogen;
  NAD(P)Hhi, cells high in NAD(P)H intensity; PE, phycoerythrin; SIRPα, signal regulatory
  protein α.
