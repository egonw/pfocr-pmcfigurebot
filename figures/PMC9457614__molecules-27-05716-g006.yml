caption: 'Plumbagin inhibited HIF-1α via PI3K/Akt/mTOR-independent signaling pathways
  under hypoxic conditions. (A) The protein expression of total PI3K, p-mTOR, and
  total mTOR were not altered by plumbagin. (B) Exposure to the compound downregulated
  HIF-1α protein expression. MCF-7 cells were treated with plumbagin (0–4 μM), BKM120
  (1 μM), MK2206 (50 nM), or rapamycin (50 nM) under hypoxic conditions for 24 h and
  subjected to Western blotting. (C–H) The relative quantities of proteins were quantified
  and normalized with β-actin or total proteins. The relative quantities of p-Akt
  (Ser473), p-Akt (Thr308), and p-mTOR proteins were quantified and normalized with
  PI3K, Akt, or mTOR. Data are means ± SEM from three independent experiments (n =
  3). # p < 0.05 vs. normoxic, * p < 0.05 vs. mimic hypoxic group without treatment.'
