caption: Diffusion tensor imaging of the optic radiation in ophthalmic diseases. (a,b)
  Diffusion tensor imaging in amblyopia. Visual white matter pathways estimated by
  probabilistic tractography (a) in representative amblyopia (left) and control (right)
  participants. Pathways are color-coded. LGN-V1 (ie, the optic radiation) is red.
  LGN = lateral geniculate nucleus; V1 = primary visual cortex; V5/hMT + = human middle
  temporal visual cortex; PLN = pulvinar nucleus. (b) Visualized optic radiation pathway
  anatomy estimates in representative control (top left) and amblyopic (bottom left)
  participants, showing significantly increased mean diffusivity in amblyopes compared
  to controls (right). (c) Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis revealed
  differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter of glaucoma patients
  and controls. A significant difference in FA was found in a 380-voxel white matter
  region in three axial slices and two sagittal slices, using threshold-free cluster
  enhancement correction for multiple comparisons. Violet (P < 0.05) and cyan (P <
  0.09) labeling show areas of decreased FA in glaucoma patients compared to controls.
  Green color labels the optic radiation, and yellow color labels the forceps major.
