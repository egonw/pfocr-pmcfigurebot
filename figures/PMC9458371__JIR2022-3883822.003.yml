caption: Overexpressed pathways shared by the two in vitro monkeypox-infected models.
  (a) The top 5% of overexpressed genes shared by the GSE21001 and GSE36854 datasets,
  filtered by a Venn diagram, represent the monkeypox-infected Macaca mulatta kidney
  epithelial (MK2) cell model and the human immortal epithelial cancer (HeLa) cell
  model. (b) The most enriched biological pathways corresponding to genes from the
  shortlist of upregulated genes shared by the two models, in order of decreasing
  log (p values). (c) The most enriched metabolic pathways as components of the Endogenous
  Metabolic Networks corresponding to genes from the shortlist of upregulated genes
  shared by the two models, in order of decreasing log (p values). (d) Related pathways
  and network analyses by MetaCore confirmed the vital role of the “immune response_IL-1
  signaling” pathway in both monkeypox-infected models. (e) Endogenous Metabolic Networks
  analyses by MetaCore confirmed the vital role of the “N-acyl-sphingosine phosphate
  pathway” in both monkeypox-infected models.
