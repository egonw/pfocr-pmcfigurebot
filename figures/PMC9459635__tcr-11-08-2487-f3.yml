caption: Ubenimex induces apoptosis mediated by chemotherapeutic drugs in SGC-7901/5-FU
  cells. (A) Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI double-stained SGC-7901/5-FU
  cells pre-treated for 24 h with 5-FU followed by the induction of ubenimex (0.06
  or 0.12 mg/mL). Representative histograms are shown (left panels), as well as the
  means ± SD of the proportions of apoptotic cells in three independent experiments
  (right panel). ****P<0.0001. (B) Western blotting of apoptosis associated protein
  expression in SGC-7901/5-FU cells after treatment for 48 h with 0.06 or 0.12 mg/mL
  ubenimex. GAPDH is shown as a loading control. Quantification was performed by a
  densitometry analysis and normalized to GAPDH levels. The bars indicate the means
  ± SD from the 3 independent experiments (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and ****P<0.0001).
  (C,D) Immunofluorescence staining of Bax and Bcl-2 with 0.06 or 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex
  treatment on SGC-7901/5-FU cells. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; Ube, ubenimex; SD, standard
  deviation.
