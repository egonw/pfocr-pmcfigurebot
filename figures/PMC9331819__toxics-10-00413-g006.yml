caption: Effect of BPS on the expression of DNMTs in mouse hippocampus. (A) The expression
  of DNMT1 mRNA. (B) The expression of DNMT3a mRNA. (C) The expression of DNMT3b mRNA.
  (D) The expression of DNMT1 protein. (E) the expression of DNMT3a protein. (F) The
  expression of DNMT3b protein. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3); compared
  with the control group * p < 0.05. (G) Grayscale scan of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b
  expression measured by Western blotting.
