caption: Pirfenidone inhibits damage to RLE-6TN cells by inhibiting bleomycin through
  the TNF-α/STAT3/KL-6 signaling pathway. (A) The MTT assay results demonstrated that
  cell viability was significantly reduced when bleomycin was added; when pirfenidone
  was added at the same time, cell viability was significantly restored (P<0.05).
  After TNF-α and Stattic were added to the cells, no significant change in activity
  occurred; (B,C) RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of STAT3 and KL-6, and
  the results demonstrated that the expression of STAT3 and KL-6 increased significantly
  when bleomycin was added. When the cells were treated with pirfenidone, the expression
  of STAT3 and KL-6 was significantly reduced. After the addition of TNF-α and Stattic,
  the expression of STAT3 and KL-6 was further reduced (P<0.05). (D) ELISAs were used
  to detect the expression of TNF-α, and the results demonstrated that the expression
  of TNF-α increased significantly when bleomycin was added. When pirfenidone was
  administered, the expression of TNF-α decreased significantly. After the addition
  of TNF-α and Stattic, the expression of TNF-α further increased (P<0.05). (E) ELISAs
  were used to detect E-cadherin expression, and the results demonstrated that the
  expression of E-cadherin was increased significantly when bleomycin was added. When
  pirfenidone was added, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly reduced (P<0.05).
  After the addition of Stattic, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly reduced
  (P<0.05). **, P<0.05. NTC, nontreated group; MC, model group; PBMC, peripheral blood
