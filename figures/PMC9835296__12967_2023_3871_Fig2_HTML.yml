caption: 'AFAP1L1 is associated with poor prognosis of GC patients. A Kaplan–Meier
  analysis of overall survival for GC patients based on AFAP1L1 mRNA expression using
  follow-up data from the TCGA STAD database. B Kaplan–Meier analysis of overall survival
  for GC patients based on AFAP1L1 mRNA expression using follow-up data from the Kaplan–Meier
  Plotter website. C Forest plot by data from univariate analysis using TCGA STAD
  database depicted hazard ratio of overall survival for indicated clinical subgroups.
  D Forest plot by data from multivariate analysis using TCGA STAD database depicted
  hazard ratio of overall survival for indicated clinical subgroups. HR: hazard ratio'
