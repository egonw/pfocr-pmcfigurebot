caption: Enrichment plots from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). (a) GSEA results
  showing differential enrichment of genes with high PROK1 expression. (FCMR activation,
  initial triggering of complement, creation of C4 and C2 activators, CD22-mediated
  BCR regulation, and complement cascade). (b) GSEA results showing differential enrichment
  of genes with low PROK1 expression (cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, ribosome, rRNA
  processing, eukaryotic translation initiation, and eukaryotic translation elongation).
  (c) GSEA results showing differential enrichment of genes with high PROK2 expression
  (scavenging of heme from plasma, CD22-mediated BCR regulation, creation of C4 and
  C2 activators, FCGR activation, and role of LAT2 NTAL lab on calcium mobilization).
  (d) GSEA results showing differential enrichment of genes with low PROK2 expression
  (ribosome, cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, activation of the mRNA upon binding of
  the cap binding complex and eifs and subsequent binding to 43â€‰s, rRNA modification
  in the nucleus and cytosol, and mRNA splicing minor pathway).
