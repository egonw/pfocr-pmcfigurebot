caption: YAP is involved in the regulation of AXL expression by integrin β3 in NSCLC
  cells. (A,B) Western blot assays showing the effects of pathway inhibitors on AXL
  expression after ectopic integrin β3 expression (+β3) in HCC827 (A) and HCC4006
  (B) cells. Veh, Vehicle; ERKi, PD98059; AKTi, LY294002; YAPi, verteporfin. (C,D)
  Western blot assays showing the effects of YAP knockdown (si-YAP) on the expression
  of AXL and nuclear YAP after ectopic integrin β3 expression (+β3) in HCC827 (C)
  and HCC4006 (D) cells. (E,F) Western blot assays showing the effects of YAP activation
  (wt YAP) on the expression of AXL and nuclear YAP after integrin β3 knockdown (sh-β3)
  in HCC827 ER (E) and HCC4006 ER (F) cells. (A–F) β-actin, GAPDH and Histone H3 were
  used as loading controls. n = 3 independent experiments.
