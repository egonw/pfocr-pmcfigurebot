caption: 'Clinical immunotherapies and alternative approaches to eliminate or circumvent
  antibodies against coagulation factors formed in patients with bleeding disorders.
  These concepts are illustrated using inhibitor formation in the treatment of hemophilia
  as an example. Alternative strategies include [1] immune tolerance induction (ITI)
  by frequent IV administration of antigen; [2] transient immune suppression therapy
  (IST); and [3] restoration of hemostasis using nonfactor therapeutics, thus avoiding
  the use of the target antigen. Center: Inhibitory antibodies are produced by B cells
  upon their T helper cell-dependent activation. T follicular helper cells promote
  the organization of germinal centers and the production of antibodies. B cells may
  differentiate into memory B cells (BM) or plasma cells (PCs), which produce antibodies
  long-term. Ultimately, inhibitors prevent blood clot formation by reducing/eliminating
  the activation of factor X. This reaction is a critical component of the coagulation
  cascade and normally occurs through the cooperation of activated FVIII (FVIIIa)
  and factor IX (FIXa). Left: Although little is known about the mechanisms by which
  ITI reverses inhibitor production upon frequent IV factor administration, evidence
  supports that high antigen doses can directly inhibit BM. IST may use small molecule
  drugs such as cyclophosphamide, a DNA alkylating agent that eliminates proliferating
  cells such as activated B and T cells. Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) depletes mature
  B cells (but not BM or PCs). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are able to suppress inhibitor
  formation. Therefore, experimental approaches use inhibition of the mTOR pathway
  with rapamycin/sirolimus (which aids in deletion of effector T cells, suppresses
  germinal center formation, and promotes Treg induction); oral antigen administration
  or hepatic gene transfer to induce Tregs, or Treg cell therapy, among other approaches.
  Right: Alternatively, nonfactor therapies bypass the effect of inhibitors by using
  a bispecific antibody that partially mimics the function of FVIII but is not recognized
  by FVIII inhibitors (a treatment that, however, only applies to HA) or promotes
  coagulation by elimination/neutralization of critical components of anticoagulant
  pathways (such as AT or TFPI) through small interfering RNA or monoclonal antibody
  therapy. AT, antithrombin III; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor.'
