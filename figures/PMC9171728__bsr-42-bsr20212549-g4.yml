figure_title: Adiponectin activated the AMPK/ACC/CPT1 signaling pathway in cultured
  chicken myoblasts
caption: (A–C) Representative bands of AMPK, ACC and CPT1. The protein expressions
  of AMPK, ACC, and CPT1 in cultured chicken myoblasts were determined by Western
  blot. (D) The enzyme activity of CPT1 was detected by ELISA kit. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01; n=6 in each group.
