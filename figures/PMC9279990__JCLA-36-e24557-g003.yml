caption: Regulated effects of IRS/PI3K/AKT in insulin signaling pathway induced by
  miR‐22 and miR‐372.The expression of proteins involved in insulin signaling in HTR8/SVneo
  (human chorionic trophoblast) cells transfected with miR‐22 or miR‐372 mimics or
  inhibitors as determined by western blotting. (A) The expression of IRS, PI3K, AKT,
  and GLUT4 in HTR8/SVneo cells treated with the miR‐22 or miR‐372 mimic. (C) The
  expression of IRS, PI3K, AKT, and GLUT4 in HTR8/SVneo cells treated with the miR‐22
  or miR‐372 inhibitor. (B and D) Semi‐quantitative analysis of these protein expression.
  The results were representative from at least three independent experiments. (one‐way
  ANOVA, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001). The IRS protein detected is the
  IRS1 subtype and the PI3K protein is the p85‐Y607 subtype
article_title: The downregulation of miR‐22 and miR‐372 may contribute to gestational
  diabetes mellitus through regulating glucose metabolism via the PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 pathway.
