caption: Expression of IL-6 signaling pathway components in human inflammatory breast
  cancer cell lines Basal mRNA levels of IL-6 (A), IL-6R (C), soluble IL-6R (D), HER2
  (E), and IL6ST/GP130 (F) were evaluated by TaqMan qRT-PCR. Expression in immortal
  MCF10A mammary epithelial cells was set to 1. Mean ± SD (n = 3). The three HER2neg
  and three HER2pos cell lines are indicated. IL-6R and sIL-6R mRNA levels were highest
  in the HER2pos cell lines. * p < 0.05. (B) Basal IL-6 protein levels in conditioned
  medium from the indicated cell lines were evaluated by ELISA. Mean ± SD (n = 4).
