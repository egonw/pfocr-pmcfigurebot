caption: MRPL9 promotes the proliferation and migration of PTC cells. (A) K1 and BCPAP
  cell lines were infected with lentivirus containing LV-Vector, LV-MRPL9, and the
  overexpression efficiency of MRPL9 was detected by Western blot. (B) Western blot
  results were quantified and normalized to Actin (n = 3). (C) K1 and BCPAP cell lines
  were infected with lentivirus containing LV-shNC and LV-shMRPL9, and the knockdown
  efficiency of MRPL9 was detected by Western blot. (D) Western blot results were
  quantified and normalized to Actin (n = 3). (E) Colony formation assays assessed
  the effect of MRPL9 overexpression or knockdown on the proliferative capacity of
  K1 and BCPAP cells. (F) Statistical analysis of the number of cell clones was performed
  in image J (n = 3). (G) The effect of MRPL9 overexpression or knockdown on the migration
  ability of K1 and BCPAP cells was examined by wound healing assay (scar bar = 100
  µm). (H) Statistical analysis of cell wound area was performed with image J (n =
  3). (I) Transwell assay to detect the effect of MRPL9 overexpression or knockdown
  on the migration ability of K1 and BCPAP cells (scar bar = 100 µm). (J) Statistical
  analysis of cell numbers was performed with image J (n = 3). Measurement data (mean
  ± standard deviation) between two groups were compared by paired t test. “*” represents
  p ≤ 0.05, “**” represents p ≤ 0.01.
