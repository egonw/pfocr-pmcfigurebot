caption: 'Differential gene expression in migrant Episyrphus. Genes appearing in the
  discussion and their assignment to functional categories along with expression calculated
  as log2fold change. Gene are placed within a theoretical framework for the genetic
  basis of migration depicting a cascade from environmental sensing, through hormonal
  control to down‐stream changes in migratory traits. Top: Environmental sensing of
  cues such as photoperiod, mediated by photosensitive proteins such as cry, modify
  circadian control of gene expression. IIS and circadian regulation converge on vri
  to modulate behavioural rhythms associated with migration such as flight and feeding.
  Middle: Hormonal control through IIS, JH, ecdysone pathways control reproductive
  diapause and longevity while also increasing energy stores and stress tolerance.
  Upregulation of octopamine (OA) synthesis pathways supply the high OA concentrations
  necessary for long periods of uninterrupted flight and the release of energy substrates
  into the haemolymph. A range of neuropeptide receptors and neuropeptides modulate
  flight, fuel, feeding and metabolic homeostasis. Bottom: Flight muscle proteins
  are upregulated and muscle function protected by autophagy via TGF‐β signalling
  and mitophagy through JAK/STAT signalling. The JAK/STAT pathway further contributes
  to immune protection from pathogens and stress responses, along with a range of
  other factors that protect the migrant from oxidative damage. Metabolism and fuelling
  genes highlight the role of lipid storage, activation and mobilisation for migration
  and the role of key limiting enzymes of the glycolytic pathway for regulating flight
  performance. Asterisk indicates genes previously identified as associated with migration
  in monarch butterflies. The genes foxo, fiz, EcR, Tdc1, Pdf, Akh, sNPF, dpp, put,
  Atg8a, Stat92E, CG4830 and CG17191 fall below 1.5 log2 fold change but within an
  adjusted p‐value of <.001 for differentially expressed genes. See discussion for
  details'
