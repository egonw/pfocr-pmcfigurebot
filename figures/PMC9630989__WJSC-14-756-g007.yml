caption: 'Effects of maternal different dietary calcium intake on gene expressions
  of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells at the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway under
  different interventions among male offspring. A: P3 BMSCs; B and D: Adipogenic induction
  and self-differentiation status of BMSCs; C and E: Osteogenic induction and self-differentiation
  status of BMSCs. All data presented as mean ± standard error (n = 9/group). One-way
  analysis of variance was performed to compare the differences among the above four
  groups, and then Student–Newman–Keuls test was used to determine the differences
  between each two groups. Compared to the NC group, aP < 0.05. NC: Normal-calcium
  reproductive diet; DC: Deficient-calcium reproductive diet; LC: Low-calcium reproductive
  diet; HC: High-calcium reproductive diet; BMSCs: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.'

  in male offspring by affecting the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem
  cells.
