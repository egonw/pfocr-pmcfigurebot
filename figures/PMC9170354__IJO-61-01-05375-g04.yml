caption: GC xenograft tumor growth inhibition by combination treatment with Curcumin
  and 5-FU. (A) Mice growing subcutaneous tumors were randomized to receive 21 intraperitoneal
  injections three times a week of either DMSO or 5-FU or curcumin or combined treatment
  (5-FU + curcumin). The tumor volume was measured using calipers (n=6 mice in each
  group) (B) The tumor weight was measured using a precision electronic balance. Representative
  images of excised tumors in SNU668 models. Scale bar, 1 cm. (C) Representative micrographs
  showing H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3 in harvested
  xenograft tumors derived from SNU668 cells mixed with CAFs after treatment. Scale
  bar, 100 Âµm. (D) Schematic diagram of the findings of the present study. CAF-induced
  cytokines activate the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer cells via paracrine
  signaling, which allows tumor cells to increasingly oppose apoptosis and increase
  their survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Curcumin, inhibitor for STAT3, that
  is a nature product, inhibits the CAF-induced activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway in GC cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.
