caption: Putative pathway for the sphingolipid biosynthesis in C. militaris by integration
  of the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) and gene expression data of
  the C5 vs. C6 cultures and the C12 vs. C6 cultures through the enhanced GSMM of
  C. militaris (iPC1469). The pathway image is modified from the KEGG database. The
  triangle shape under the metabolite name indicate the significant DAMs observed
  in this pathway consisting of sphinganine, sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and ceramide.
  List of DAMs and DEGs involved in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway are listed
  in . The asterisk (*) means the reference carbon source used for all possible pairwise
  comparisons.
