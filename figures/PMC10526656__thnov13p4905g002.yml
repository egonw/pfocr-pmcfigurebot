caption: Characterization of cell fates by scRNAseq after lineage reprogramming. (A)
  A t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot of scRNAseq data analyzed
  using Seurat. Cluster numbers, names, and examples of enriched genes are displayed.
  FMH, fully transformed mature hepatocytes; PTM, partially transformed metabolic
  hepatocyte-like cells; PTS, partially transformed stromal hepatocyte-like cells;
  UPT, untransformed proliferation tumor cells; UQT, untransformed quiescent tumor
  cells. (B, C) Heatmap shows expression of DEGs in the five cell subsets. Color scheme
  is based on z-score distribution, from -2 (purple) to 2 (yellow). Genes (rows) with
  (log2 fold change [FC]) > 1 and adjusted P < 0.01 are listed in each subset. The
  tSNE visualization of gene expression of PLK1 (D), BUB1(E), CCNB1(F), FOXM1(G),
  MYBL2(H), ALB(I), CYP2S1(J), AKR1C1(K) for all clusters that underwent lineage reprogramming.
  (L). The network diagram for GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes in
  UPT and FMH (M). The color bar at the right indicates gene expression in log2 scale.
  Red and blue colors represent higher and lower gene expression levels, respectively.
  (N) Expression profiling of genes involved in tumor proliferation-related genes.
  (O) Expression profiling of genes involved in liver metabolism-related genes.
