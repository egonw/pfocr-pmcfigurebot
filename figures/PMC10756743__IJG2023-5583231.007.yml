caption: Coexpression analysis of THBS2 and lncRNAs, based on ENCORI and GEPIA2 online
  databases. (a) Coexpression analysis based on ENCORI revealed that THBS2 has no
  significant coexpression with BAIAP-AS1, TSIX, and LINC01215. (b) Coexpression analysis
  based on GEPIA2 revealed that THBS2 has a significant coexpression with BAIAP2-AS1.
