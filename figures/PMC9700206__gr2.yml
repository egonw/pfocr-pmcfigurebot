caption: Schematic overview of multiple levels of lignin pathway regulation in trees.Arrows
  with filled arrowheads represent metabolic conversions, and arrows with hollow arrowheads
  represent translocation, protein modification, or signaling. Pac-man-like spheres
  represent enzymes, and polygons represent metabolites.
