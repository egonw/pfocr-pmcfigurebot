caption: Construction of TGF-β signal score in eight datasets. (a) The scatter diagram
  indicated the distribution of TGF-β signal score across eight datasets. (b) The
  scatter diagram exhibited the TGF-β signal score in HNSC and normal samples. (c)
  Relationship between TGF-β signal score, HPV infection status, M stage and clinical
  stage in TCGA_HNSC and GEO database. (d) The top 8 results of GO analysis (BP, CC,
  and MF) in TGF-β signal pathway_H (red) and TGF-β signal pathway_L (blue). (e) The
  results of KEGG analysis in TGF-β signal pathway_H (red) and TGF-β signal pathway_L
  (blue).
