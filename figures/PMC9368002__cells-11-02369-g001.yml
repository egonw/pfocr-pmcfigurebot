caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis tool (IPA, Qiagen) was used to analyse dataset
  and explore the diseases and biological processes which are predicted to be increasing
  or decreasing based on the pattern of differentially expressed genes in the dataset.
  From this analysis we extrapolated the scheme in the Figure that includes the genes
  related to lipid synthesis differentially expressed in our dataset (p-value = 9.67
  × 10−4). The full names of these genes, together with the relative fold change (log2
  ratio) are reported in . In red, upregulated genes; in green, downregulated genes.
