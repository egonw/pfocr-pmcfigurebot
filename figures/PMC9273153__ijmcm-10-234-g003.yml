caption: Known regulators of TGF-β autoinduction. In this illustration, TGF-β1 isoform
  is used as an example of the ligand being self-induced. Smad and JNK pathways induce
  expression of JUN family protein as an AP-1 component. Together with the FOS family
  protein induced by the ERK pathway, JUN family protein form an AP-1 complex that
  promotes TGF-β1 transcription. Later, RhoA-mTOR pathways enable TGF-β1 protein translation
  through phosphorylation and dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. LMO7 inhibits AP-1
  transcriptional activity and acts as a negative feedback regulator to prevent further
  TGF-β1 production
