caption: BAK + ELN hypothesized mechanisms of action. BAK + ELN inhibits FABP5 and
  FAAH, resulting in an increased abundance of eCB ligands (AEA, 2-AG, OEA, PEA).
  Ligands interact with receptors (CB1, CB2, TRPV1) with downstream anti-inflammatory
  effects. Such effects are mediated by decreased TLR3 expression with inhibition
  of transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, IRF3, ISGF3). Loss of NF-κB activity blocks
  the activation of COX-2 by TNF, whereas loss of IRF3 and ISGF3 DNA binding decreases
  type I IFN gene expression, leading to decreased inflammatory cell activation. Loss
  of FABP5 and FAAH activity favors a proliferative KC phenotype, mediated by decreased
  abundance of linoleic acid 13(S)-HODE. The risk of skin barrier compromise is countered
  by conversion of ELN to linoleic acid and loss of cortisol production. The figure
  was created using BioRender. 13(S)-HODE, 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; 2-AG,
