caption: Mode of action used by various anthelmintics to exert their anticancer effects.
  The anthelmintics work through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization to form
  microtubule, downregulation of Hedgehog signaling pathway, inhibition and downregulation
  of wnt/B-catenin pathway, and inhibition of Notch, NF-κB, mTOR, STAT3, and MEK1/2-ERK1/2
  signaling pathways; downregulation of c-Myc signaling pathway; upregulation of JNK
  signaling pathway, inhibition and downregulation of cyclin D1-CDK4 pathway; downregulation
  of pc-jun pathway; upregulation of LC3B; upregulation of DR4 and p-ERK pathways,
  and inhibition of ERK and AKT. ABZ, albendazole; IVM, ivermectin; LV, levamisole;
  MBZ, mebendazole; NIC, niclosamide; FLU, flubendazole; RAF, Rafoxanide; NTZ, nitazoxanide;
  PP, pyrvinium pamoate; EP, eprinomectin; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; CDK4, cyclin-dependent
  kinase 4; LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B; DR4, death receptor
  4; p-ERK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; AKT, protein
  kinase B. Reproduced with permission from ref. []. Copyright 2021 Elsevier.
