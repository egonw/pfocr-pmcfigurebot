caption: α-Synuclein accumulation in nematode muscle cells is diminished by narcissoside
  (NCS)-induced autophagy. (A) NL5901 nematodes at the L3 stage were treated with
  NCS for three days. The fluorescence intensity exhibited by accumulating α-synuclein
  in muscle cells was then analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Leaf panel).
  The fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (Right panel). (B)
  The expression of α-synuclein in each group of nematodes in (A) was analyzed by
  Western blotting. β-actin is an internal loading control (top panel). The fluorescence
  intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (bottom panel). (C) DA2123 nematodes
  at the L3 stage were treated with NCS for three days. The dots formed by the autophagy
  marker LGG-GFP in seam cells were observed (Leaf panel) and counted by a fluorescence
  microscope. The right panel is the average result of the fluorescent dot count analysis
  of all seam cells in each group of worms.
