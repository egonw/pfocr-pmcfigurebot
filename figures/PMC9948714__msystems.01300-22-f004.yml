caption: Changes in the fecal metabolome. (A) Principal-component analysis (PCA) score
  plot of the probiotic (Pro) and placebo (Pla) groups before (0M) and after (3M)
  the 3-month intervention. “QC” represents quality control samples. Samples from
  different subgroups are shown in different colors. (B) Volcano plot showing differential
  metabolites between the probiotic group and the placebo group at 3 months. Significantly
  increased metabolites (UP [upregulated]) (fold change [FC] of >2 and P value of
  <0.05) and significantly decreased metabolites (DOWN [downregulated]) (fold change
  of <0.5 and P value of <0.05) are represented. Non-SIG, nonsignificant. (C) Metabolic
  pathway enrichment analysis based on the differentially abundant metabolites. (D)
  Box plots showing relevant fecal metabolites responsive to probiotic intervention
  in diabetes patients. A total of 37 patients provided fecal samples at two consecutive
  time points for metabolomics analysis (probiotic group, n = 20; placebo group, n = 17).
  Statistical differences were assessed by a Wilcoxon test or a t test, and a P value
  of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
