caption: Schematic of pathways involving glucose and lactate metabolism. (A) Arrows
  indicate differentially expressed transcripts encoding for an enzyme or transporter
  in cells derived from the nucleus pulposus (N), annulus fibrosus (A), or adipose
  (F) tissue. (B) Illustrates NP niche conditions, metabolic pathways and gradients
  of crucial contributors to the NP niche condition alongside their transporters.
  Cells were isolated from a single donor to avoid the genotype effect. Cells were
  analyzed as three replicates for AF and NP and two replicates for FAT cells. P,
  phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
