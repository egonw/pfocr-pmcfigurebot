caption: Association between HRR pathway gene alterations and genomic scar scores
  or TMB. Solid cancer samples from TCGA were arranged in order of (A) HRD score (n
  = 9,399), (B) Sig3 ratio (n = 9,610), and (C) TMB (n = 9,672). The top and second
  panels show the distribution of mutations with and without locus-specific LOH, respectively,
  stratified by germline (prefix g) or somatic (prefix s) and BRCA1, BRCA2, or non-BRCA
  HRR pathway genes. The third group of panels show homozygous deletions in BRCA2,
  RAD51B, and HRR pathway genes (excluding BRCA1/2 but including RAD51B), and the
  fourth panel shows BRCA1 methylation. The fifth panels contain the scar scores or
  TMB values used for ordering; for TMB-based analysis, samples are also annotated
  with MSI-high and somatic POLE mutation statuses. Box plots in bottom panels assess
  the distribution of values for each stratification. *, **, and *** stand for P <
  .01, P < 1 × 10−4, and P < 1 × 10−6 in the Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Asterisks
  in red indicate a negative correlation with the corresponding signature value. HRD,
  homologous recombination deficiency; HRR, homologous recombination repair; LOH,
  loss of heterozygosity; Sig3, mutational signature 3; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas;
  TMB, tumor mutation burden.
