caption: Impacts of chronic JB1, letrozole, or JB1+Let treatment on hippocampal MAPK
  and Akt pathway activation in long-term ovariectomized rats with or without previous
  midlife estradiol exposure. Middle-aged female rats were ovariectomized and immediately
  implanted with vehicle (Long-term OVX, No Estradiol groups) or estradiol (Long-term
  OVX, Previous Estradiol groups) capsules. Forty days later, capsules were removed.
  One hundred days following loss of circulating estrogens (either via ovariectomy
  in Long-term OVX, No Estradiol group or removal of estradiol capsule in Long-term
  OVX, Previous Estradiol group), rats were trained on the 8-arm radial maze task
  and subsequently treated with chronic intracerebroventricular administration of
  Veh, the IGF-1R antagonist JB1 (JB1), the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (Let), or
  JB1 and letrozole (JB1+Let). After rats were tested on the radial-arm maze, hippocampi
  were dissected and processed for Western blotting for phosphorylated and total levels
  of p44-MAPK, p42-MAPK, and Akt. Phosphorylated levels were normalized to the total
  protein levels. Graph represents mean D×A ± SEM expressed as a percentage of the
  vehicle group. Following long-term ovariectomy with no estradiol exposure, there
  was an effect of treatment (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of p44-MAPK (A) and
  p42-MAPK (B), with post hoc testing revealing increased phosphorylation of both
  MAPK phosphorylation sites in the JB1 group compared with the Veh group. There was
  also an effect of treatment (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of Akt (C), with
  post hoc testing revealing decreased phosphorylation in both the JB1 and JB1+Let
  groups compared with Veh group. Following long-term ovariectomy with previous estradiol
  exposure, there was an effect of treatment (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of
  p44-MAPK (D) and p42-MAPK (E), with post hoc testing revealing decreased phosphorylation
  of both MAPK phosphorylation sites in the JB1, Let, and JB1+Let groups compared
  with the Veh group. There was also an effect of treatment (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated
  levels of Akt (F), with post hoc testing revealing no significant difference between
  the treatment groups and the Veh group. *p < 0.05 versus Veh.
