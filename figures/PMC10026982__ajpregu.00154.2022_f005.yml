caption: Representative diagram with findings of the present study. Serum from women
  who developed severe COVID-19 promotes umbilical artery dysfunction associated with
  vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility by increased IL-6 levels and consequently
  increased Nox1-dependent ROS generation and activation of the Rho kinase pathway.
  COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IL-6, interleukin 6; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  VSM, vascular smooth muscle.
