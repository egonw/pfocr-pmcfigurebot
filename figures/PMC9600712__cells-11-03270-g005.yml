caption: 'Activation of the AMPK signaling pathway is responsible for FSH-induced
  mitophagy in senescent GCs. The SYF-GCs of D280 hens were treated with D-gal (200
  mM) for 24 h and were induced to become premature senescent GCs. Subsequently, 0.01
  IU/mL of FSH was added and stimulated the premature senescent GCs for 24 h. (A)
  Transmission electron micrograph of mitophagosomes (red arrows) in the senescent
  GCs with FSH treatment. Swollen mitochondria were observed in the D-gal group, whereas
  this damage was alleviated after FSH addition. Scale bars: 1 μm and 500 nm. (B)
  GCs were collected for JC-1 staining to observe the healthy mitochondria (uptaking
  red fluorescent aggregates of JC-1) and defective mitochondria (uptaking green fluorescent
  monomeric JC-1). (C,D) Western blot and quantitative analyses of LC3-II and TOMM20
  expression in normal, D-gal, D-gal + FSH, FSH alone-treated GCs. (E) Western blot
  and quantitative analyses of AMPK phosphorylation in GCs (normal, D-gal, D-gal +
  FSH, FSH). (F,G) Colocalization of mitophagic markers (LC3 and TOMM20) in GCs treated
  as indicated above. CC: Compound C. Scale bar: 5 μm. (H,I) Western blot analysis
  of p-AMPK/AMPK, LC3-II, TOMM20 proteins in normal, D-gal, D-gal + FSH, D-gal + FSH
  +Compound C (AMPK inhibitor), Compound C groups. (J) ATP levels of GCs that were
  treated as indicated above (H). Different lowercase letters indicate significant
  differences (p < 0.05).'
