caption: The activin/TGFβ signaling network in pancreatic cancer. The canonical signaling
  axis of the TGF-β superfamily members is Smad4-dependent, while the non-canonical
  signaling is Smad4-independent. ACVR1B/ALK4 is the major type I receptor for the
  activin signaling pathway, while TGFRB1/ALK5 and ACVR1/ALK2 are the major type I
  receptors for TGFβ and BMP signaling, respectively. In the canonical activin signaling,
  the pathway is activated by the binding of activins to one of the two type II receptors,
  ACVR2A or ACVR2B, which then recruit a type 1 receptor, such as ACVR1B/ALK4. The
  activated ACVR1B/ALK4 receptor subsequently recruits and phosphorylates SMAD2 and
  SMAD3, which then bind to the coregulatory SMAD4, and the complex translocates into
  the nucleus where it regulates gene transcriptions. Activin bioactivity can be modulated
  by antagonists, such as Follistatin, FLRG (follistatin-related gene), InhBP (inhibin-binding
  protein), etc.
