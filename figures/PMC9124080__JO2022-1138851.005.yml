caption: 'Knockdown of FOXO3 notably reversed the effect of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin
  on proliferation of K562 cell. (a) MTT assay was applied to detect the proliferation
  of K562 cell. (b, c) The proportion of K562 cells in different cell cycle was evaluated
  by flow cytometry. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with control group. #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01, compared with 6,7-Doc group.'
