caption: 'Influence of losartan treatment on YAP phosphorylation and downstream gene
  expression in vitro. (A-C) western blots of HUVECs showed that angiotensin II induced
  YAP dephosphorylation, whereas losartan upregulated the phosphorylated YAP content.
  **P<0.01 vs. 0 h. (D,E) Quantitative western blots of HUVECs under drug coincubation
  demonstrated that losartan treatment reversed YAP dephosphorylation induced by Ang
  II. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. Ang II(−) Losartan(−); ##P<0.01 vs. Ang II(+) Losartan(−);
  &&P<0.01 vs. Ang II(+) Losartan(+). (F,G) qRT-PCR revealed that losartan treatment
  inhibited the upregulation of YAP-related downstream genes induced by Ang II. **P<0.01
  vs. Ang II(−) Losartan(−); *P<0.05 vs. Ang II(−) Losartan(−); ##P<0.01 vs. Ang II(+)
  Losartan(−); #P<0.05 vs. Ang II(+) Losartan(−). HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; YAP, yes-associated
