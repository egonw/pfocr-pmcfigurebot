caption: During long-term seed storage, mitochondrial structure is damaged in seeds
  due to increased ROS levels, oxidative damage to membranes, loss of enzyme activities
  and reduced activity of the antioxidant system []. We hypothesize that, during seed
  storage, under the influence of ROS, changes in metabolic activity and respiratory
  electron transport chain initiate the switch to the alternative respiratory pathway.
  The switch to ubiquinone-linked AOX for electron transport is regulated by mitochondrial
  TRX, changes in metabolite concentrations and by transcriptional control. During
  long-term seed storage, a decrease in the activity of systems regulating the redox
  state of cells is observed. The level of thiol group-containing proteins, i.e.,
  TRXs and PRXs, mainly decreases [], i.e., proteins that are actively involved in
  regulating the level of ROS and in modulating redox signaling. The decrease in the
  activity of TRX and PRX, on the one hand, likely affects the decrease in AOX activity
  and disrupts the phosphorylating electron transport and energy production needed
  by the cell to function properly. On the other hand, the decrease in the activity
  of TRX and PRX will lower the antioxidant defense, increase the ROS level and enhance
  mitochondrial dysfunction. The sum of all these events accelerates the aging process
  and reduces seed viability.
