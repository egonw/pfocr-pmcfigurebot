caption: Schematic diagram of the interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription factor (STAT)-6 signalling pathways []. Both IL-4 and IL-13 signal
  via the IL-4Rα, a component of the type I (IL-4Rα and γc) and type II receptors
  (IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1). IL-4 signals via both type I and II receptor pathways, whereas
  IL-13 signals only via the type II IL-4R. IL-13 also binds to the IL-13Rα2 chain,
  which does not contain a transmembrane-signalling domain and is thought to act as
  a decoy receptor. γc activates janus kinase (JAK)3, whereas IL-13Rα1 activates tyrosine
  kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK2. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate STAT-6. Phosphorylated
  STAT-6 dimerises, migrates to the nucleus, and binds to the promoters of the IL-4
  and IL-13 responsive genes, such as those associated with T-helper type 2 (Th2)
  cell differentiation, airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and
  mucus production.
