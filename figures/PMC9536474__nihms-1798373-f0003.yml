figure_title: Design of Cu-catalysed 1,2-hydroamination of benzene
caption: a, Cycloaddition between benzene (14) and MTAD (18) provides cycloadduct
  19, which upon exposure to catalytically-generated copper hydride delivers hydroaminated
  product 13. b, Plausible catalytic cycle for this reaction that proceeds through
  Cu-olefin ligated complex I, involving either hydrocupration (I→II) and β-elimination
  (II→III), or an oxidative addition (I→IV) and reductive elimination (IV→III) pathway.
