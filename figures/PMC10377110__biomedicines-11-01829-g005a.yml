caption: 'Microarray data analysis of the hLESCs treated with Wnt/β-catenin activator
  and control hLESCs. (A) The principal component analysis (PCA) plot demonstrates
  two different clusters: the control (untreated) samples as red ellipses vs. samples
  treated with 5 nM LY2090314 as blue ellipses. Samples are matched pairs of the same
  donors. (B) Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) shows changes in the expression of
  genes involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hLESCs treated with LY2090314 compared
  to control hLESCs. Upregulated genes are marked with red and pink figures, while
  downregulated genes are marked with green figures. The stronger color intensity
  demonstrates a greater change in expression. Data from six donors (n = 6) presented
  with p-values given below the figures, whereas the fold changes (FCs) in gene expression
  were found to be below the p-values.'
