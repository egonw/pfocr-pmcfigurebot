caption: 'Overview of the DNA damage repair pathways and their commonly associated
  cancers (clockwise). TOP LEFT: Single-stranded breaks are repaired via either short-patch
  base excision repair (SP-BER) or long-patch BER (LP-BER). BER begins when the DNA
  base is damaged and is excised by the enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease
  1 (APE1) and further processed by either SP-BER or LP-BER. Polymorphisms in BER
  pathway genes have been linked to an increased risk for the development of lung
  and other cancers. TOP RIGHT: Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are repaired via homologous
  recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ). HR: the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex detects double-stranded
  breaks. NHEJ: the Ku70/80 heterodimer detects and binds to the DSBs. MMEJ: the protein-coding
  gene poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) detects DSB mutations in HR pathway
  genes that are frequently associated with breast and other cancers. BOTTOM RIGHT:
  Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is activated upon the detection of bulky
  DNA lesions and starts off as either a global genome NER (GG-NER) or a transcription-coupled
  NER (TC-NER). Mutations in TC-NER proteins have been identified in a subset of ovarian
  cancers, conferring increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. BOTTOM
  MIDDLE: Mismatched repair (MMR) pathway is initiated by recruitment and binding
  of the MutLÎ± complex on the damaged site. Mutations in MMR pathway genes are associated
  with colorectal and other cancers. BOTTOM LEFT: In the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway,
  FANCM is first recruited to the site of ICL damage at the stalled replication fork
  along with FAAP24 and the heterodimer MHF1/2, followed by HR pathway mutations in
  FA pathway genes that lead to the Fanconi anemia syndrome characterized by a high
  incidence of childhood leukemias.'
