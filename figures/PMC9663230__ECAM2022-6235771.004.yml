caption: 'FRS2 is a direct downstream target of TRIM44 in EC cells (a) Heatmap showing
  differential mRNA expression in TRIM44-knockdown cells (fold change value > 1.5
  and P < 0.01). (b) Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes in TRIM44-knockdown
  cells. (c) GO analysis of the target genes of TRIM44 are arranged into different
  functional groups. ((d), (e)) Expression of TRIM44 and FRS2 in TRIM44-knockdown
  and TRIM44-overexpressing Ishikawa cells was assessed by Q–PCR and Western blot
  analysis. (f) Ishikawa cells were immunoprecipitated using FRS2 and TRIM44 antibodies.
  ((g), (h)) Expression of FRS2, BMP4, β-catenin, and TGF-βR1 in TRIM44-knockdown
  EC cells was assessed by Western blot analysis. all data are presented as the mean ± SD.
  statistical significance: ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the shNC or control group.'
