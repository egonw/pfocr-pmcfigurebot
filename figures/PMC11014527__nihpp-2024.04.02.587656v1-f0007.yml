caption: 'Circular diagrams illustrating the cancer-supportive biological processes
  that were affected by the drug treatments. (A) Cancer hallmarks, HCMDB and CGC database
  protein matches. (B) Proteins with altered behavior mapped to the EGFR/ERBB2 and
  PI3K/PKB pathways and associated cancer hallmarks. Gene name color code: green-proteins
  mapped to both pathways; red-protein mapped to the EGFR/ERBB2 pathway only; blue-proteins
  mapped to the PI3K/PKB pathway only.'
