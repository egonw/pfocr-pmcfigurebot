caption: Schematic representation depicting the effects of NAA10 on OSCC invasion
  and metastasis. NAA10, by interacting with p65 and inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of p65, inhibits p65 goes into the cell nucleus and binds to Pirh2 promoter, and
  further attenuates the transcription expression of Pirh2 gene. Thereby the inhibition
  of Pirh2 increased the expression of the down‐stream tumour suppressor genes p53,
  which leads to the down‐regulation of the expression of the downstream MMP‐2 and
  MMP‐9 genes and plays the role of inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of OSCC
article_title: N‐α‐Acetyltransferase 10 inhibits invasion and metastasis of oral squamous
  cell carcinoma via regulating Pirh2‐p53 signalling pathway.
