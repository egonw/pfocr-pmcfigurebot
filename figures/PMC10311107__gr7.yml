caption: Regulatory network of other secondary metabolites in the stems of Dendrobium nobile.
  Red letters represent up-regulated expression (FDR were < 0.5 and fold change were
  ≥ 1.5), green letters represent down-regulated expression (FDR were < 0.5 and fold
  change were ≤ -1.5), blue letters represent both up- and down-regulated expression,
  and black letters represent no significant change in metabolite accumulation or
  gene expression. The orange box and letters indicate a pathway. Heatmaps show the
  level of increase and decrease of enzyme gene expression. Color scale on the top
  right represented normalized values of FPKM values and six boxes of each enzyme
  gene represented three biological replicates of DnS1 and DnS2, respectively. TAT,
  tyrosine aminotransferase; PPDC, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase; TYNA, primary amine
  oxidase; DDC, l-tryptophan decarboxylase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonialyase; TC2M,
  trans-cinnamate 2-monooxygenase; CR, 2-coumarate reductase; PAR, phenylalanine racemase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA-ligase; CYP73A, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; PTAL, phenylalanine/tyrosine
  ammonia-lyase; HCT, shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; CYP98A, 5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate
  3'-monooxygenase; COMT, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase; TAM, tyrosine 2, 3-aminomutase;
  TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; HPPR, hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase; 4HCT, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
  thioesterase; PAH, phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; FNSI, flavone synthase I.
