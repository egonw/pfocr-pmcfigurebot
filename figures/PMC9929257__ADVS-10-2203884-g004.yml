caption: RNF126 expression is induced by IR activating the HER2‐AKT‐NF‐κB pathway.
  A) IR‐induced RNF126 expression. MDA‐MB‐231 and HCC1806 cell lines were treated
  with IR (10 Gy) and harvested for Western blotting analysis at 0, 12, and 24 h points
  post‐IR. B) HER2 knockdown inhibited IR‐induced RNF126 mRNA expression. MDA‐MB‐231
  and HCC1806 transfected with siCON or siHER2 following treatment with IR (10 Gy)
  and harvested for qPCR analysis at 24 h point post‐IR. C) AKT knockdown inhibited
  IR‐induced expression of p‐RelA and RNF126. MDA‐MB‐231 and HCC1806 transfected with
  siCON or siAKT following treatment with IR (10 Gy) and harvested for Western blotting
  analysis at 0 and 24 h point post‐IR. D) Knockdown RelA inhibited IR‐induced expression
  of RNF126. MDA‐MB‐231 and HCC1806 transfected with siCON or siRelA following treatment
  with IR (10 Gy) and harvested for Western blotting analysis at 0 and 24 h point
  post‐IR. E) Knockdown RelA inhibited IR‐induced RNF126 mRNA expression. MDA‐MB‐231
  and HCC1806 transfected with siCON or siRelA following treatment with IR (10 Gy)
  and harvested for qPCR analysis at 24 h point post‐IR. F,G) The expression levels
  of p‐RelA and RNF126 were positively correlated in breast cancer patients receiving
  radiotherapy. Representative IHC results for p‐RelA and RNF126 are shown. The negative
  results are shown in the left panel, and the positive results are shown in the right
  panel. Scale bar, 50 µm. The Spearman's method was used to test the correlation
  between RNF126 and p‐RelA. H) RNF126 was positively correlated with RelA and AKT
  in cancer samples. Correlation of RNF126 with RelA and AKT in expression in cancer
  samples based on the data from the TCGA database. Note that every dot represents
  one cancer type.
