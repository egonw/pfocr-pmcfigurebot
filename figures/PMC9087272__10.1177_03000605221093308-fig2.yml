caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) inhibited the proliferation of two
  gastric cancer cell lines in vitro: (a) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with
  a range of concentrations of PL for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The cell viability was
  determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
  (MTT) assay; (b) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with a range of concentrations
  of VC for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The cell viability was determined using an MTT assay.
  A control group (0) was treated with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide. Data presented
  as the mean of triplicate experiments. The colour version of this figure is available
