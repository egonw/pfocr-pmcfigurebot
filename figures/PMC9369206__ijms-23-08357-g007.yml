caption: Expression patterns of DEGs in flavonoid synthesis pathways of different
  light treatment samples. The heatmap shows the expression patterns of differentially
  expressed structural genes related to the flavonoid pathway in pepper peels at different
  stages (upper left). Each row represents a unigene, and the expression change in
  the unigenes is based on the FPKM (the number of kilobase fragments of exon per
  million reads). The closer to blue, the lower the expression, and the closer to
  red, the higher the expression.
