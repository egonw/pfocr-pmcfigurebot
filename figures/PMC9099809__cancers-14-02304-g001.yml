caption: MEOX2 depletion inhibits the sphere-forming and the growth ability of glioblastoma
  stem cells BT273 and BT379. (a,b) MEOX2 qRT-PCR analysis of BT273 (a) or BT379 (b)
  cells transduced with shRNA18 or shRNA53 or ctrl lentiviral constructs. The values
  were reported in relation to cells transduced with ctrl vector set as = 1 and normalized
  to PPP2CA mRNA expression (n = 3; mean ± SD). (c,d) MEOX2 Western blot analysis
  of BT273 (c) or BT379 (d) cells transduced with shRNA18 or shRNA53 or ctrl lentiviral
  constructs. For BT273 and BT379, α-tubulin and β-actin were used as the internal
  loading controls, respectively. Representative images are shown. The bottom histograms
  show the quantification of MEOX2 in relation to α-tubulin and β-actin. (n = 3; mean
  ± SD). (e,f) Sphere-forming assay of BT273 (e) and BT379 (f) cells transduced with
  shRNA18 or shRNA53 or ctrl lentiviral constructs. Histograms show the percentage
  of cells capable of re-forming a neurosphere seven days after dissociation (n =
  3; mean ± SD). Representative micrographs are shown. (g,h) Growth curves of BT273
  (g) and BT379 (h) cells transduced with shRNA18 or shRNA53 or ctrl lentiviral constructs.
  (n = 3; mean ± SD). Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired
  Student’s t-test (two-tailed). Significance was defined as * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001, statistical difference compared to the control.
