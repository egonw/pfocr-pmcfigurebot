caption: 'Saponin alleviated DEP-exacerbated airway inflammation and MUC5AC expression
  in OVA-sensitized mice. (A–C) Light microscope images of bronchiole tissues from
  control, saponin-treated and non-treated OVA-sensitized mice with or without DEP
  exposure (200-x magnification). In comparison to the mice sensitized with OVA independently,
  DEP exacerbated the inflammation, mucus overproduction, and MUC5AC expression in
  OVA-challenged asthmatic mice. (A) H&E staining: Saponin alleviated inflammatory
  cell infiltrations (white arrow) in OVA-sensitized mice with and without DEP. (B)
  PAS staining: Saponin inhibited mucus production (black arrow) in both DEP-treated
  and non-treated OVA-sensitized mice. (C) Immunohistochemistry for MUC5AC: Saponin
  reduced MUC5AC-positive cells (black arrowhead) in OVA-challenged mice with and
  without DEP. (D) Semi-quantitative analysis of immunoreactivity score for MUC5AC:
  Saponin significantly lowered the MUC5AC-IHC scores in both OVA-sensitized mice
  with and without DEP. (E) DEP-exposed OVA-sensitized mice indicated a significant
  increase in MUC5AC mRNA expression, compared with OVA-sensitized mice without DEP.
  Saponin significantly blocked MUC5AC expression in both OVA-challenged groups with
  and without DEP treatment. Scale bars, 100 μm ∗and †p < 0.05 in comparison to OVA,
  ‡p < 0.05 in comparison to OVA + DEP. DEP, diesel exhaust particles; OVA, ovalbumin;
  H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; IHC, immunohistochemistry.'
