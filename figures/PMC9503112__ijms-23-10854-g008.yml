caption: Biological effects induced by compound 7c in vitro. Confocal microphotographs
  of control (a,e) and compound 7c treated (5 μM) (b,c,f,g) for 24 h MCF7 cells stained
  with Hoechst33342 (a–f), LysoTrackRed (e,f), and DCF (g). Release of nuclear material
  into cytoplasm (c,d, red arrows), disassembling of chromosomes (green arrow), large
  vesicles in the cytoplasm of the cells (white arrows), depolarization of lysosomes
  (f), and ROS production (g) show different types of cell death under compounds 7
  influence. Scale bar is 10–15 μm.
