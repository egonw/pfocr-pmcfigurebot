caption: 'The MBOP/MEK1/pERK/MMP2/MMP9 axis in CRC. (A) MBOP substantially promoted
  the pERK1/2 in HCT116 and HCT15, but the total ERK expression did not show significant
  differences. (B) Overexpressing MBOP in HCT116 and HCT15 paved the axis of MBOP/MEK1/pERK/MMP2/MMP9.
  (C) The signaling pathway axis in animal assay met the expression tendency of in
  vitro assays (n = 4). (D) HCT116 and HCT15 were treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor
  U0126-EtOH for 48 h, and the protein expression of MEK1/2, pERK1/2, and downstream
  MMP2 and MMP9 all decreased violently. (E) HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids
  pcDNA3.1+, pORF-FLAG, and pORFmut-FLAG, followed by treatments of DMSO and U0126-EtOH.
  The overexpression of MEK1 and MBOP brought by transfecting cells with pORF-FLAG
  could be partially inhibited by U0126-EtOH, whereas the MAP2K1 showed no significant
  alterations. Data are presented as mean Â± SD, **** p < 0.0001. ns: not significant.
  (F) The pro-migration effect driven by the transfection of pORF-FLAG could be partially
  reversed by U0126-EtOH.'
