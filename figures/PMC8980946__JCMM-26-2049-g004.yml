caption: Common STAT cellular activation‐inactivation cycle pathways. (A) Variety
  of cytokines, hormones and growth factors can activate STAT family members. (B)
  Binding of the ligand to either the cytokine or growth factor (GF) receptor induces
  series of the activation cascades. Whereas JAK kinase activation is generally exclusive
  to cytokine receptor signaling, STAT action is triggered by both receptor types.
  Typically, auto‐phosphorylated receptor‐associated Janus kinases (JAKs) phospho‐activate
  STATs which form STAT parallel dimer and are transported across nuclear membrane
  by Importin α’s (KPNA1) and involve the action of Nucleophosmin I decamer (not shown).
  Binding of activated STATs to DNA is coupled to interactions with various transcriptional
  regulators discussed in the main text. Phosphatase‐mediated inactivation of the
  DNA‐bound STAT complex disengages the dimer from the DNA, breaks them into monomers
  and leads to their export via nuclear exportins (XPO1). Cytokine and growth factor
  receptors are both inducers of the RAS‐RAF‐MAPK and the PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR pathways.
  For simplicity, other signaling pathways such as activation of PKC or PLC are excluded.
  STAT3 is also capable of localizing into the mitochondria inner matrix and influencing
  ROS production. (C) STATs are also reported to be involved in the DNA damage response
  (e.g., TP53 and BRCA1/2) and interact with epigenetic modifiers (e.g., EZH2, TET1/2/3,
  SWI/SNF, PRC1/2, CBP‐p300 and NCOA‐1). CNTF, ciliary neurotrophic factor; EGF, Epidermal
