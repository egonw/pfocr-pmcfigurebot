caption: 'miRNA signature of CD10Low sEVs. (A) From 166 MSC-related miRNAs analyzed,
  151 miRNA cargos were present in CD10Low sEVs. In CD10Low sEVs, six miRNAs cargo
  were highly present (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-6089, hsa-miR-4466, hsa-miR-3665, hsa-miR-4454,
  hsa-miR-7975). (B) Reactome analysis of miRNAs highly present in CD10Low sEVs showed
  their involvement in the regulation of six gene groups related to gene expression,
  the immune system, NGF/PDGF/Wnt pathways, metabolism of proteins, the cell cycle,
  and cellular responses to stress (blue spots: miRNAs detected in sEVs, black spots:
  genes related to pathways, yellow spots: genes related to pathway that are affected
  by miRNAs detected in sEVs).'
