caption: Effect of CO treatment on serum metabolic phenotype in HFD-fed mice. (A)
  Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. Overview of metabolites that were enriched
  in mice treated with CO fed a high-fat diet compared to the HFD group; (B) Metabolic
  pathway related to lipid enrichment analysis. Overview of metabolites related to
  lipid that was enriched in mice treated with CO fed a high-fat diet compared to
  the HFD group. Each dietary group comprised n = 6 mice.
