caption: Cytokine signaling pathway involved in SSTP1 response (A) STAT/.JAK, JNK/AP1
  MAPK1/2, and AKT pathways are reported to be downstream of Cytokine signaling. Heat
  map showing differential expression of molecules involved in cytokine signaling
  are shown. (B) Schematic diagram of cytokine signaling pathway in SSTP1 response.
