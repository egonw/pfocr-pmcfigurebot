caption: A simplified overview of mTOR signaling pathway and mitophagy. A) mTOR is
  one of the main regulators of autophagy by controlling the activity of the ULK1/ULK2
  complex. Under various cellular stresses active AMPK inhibits the activity of mTORC.
  Inhibited mTOR promotes the activity of the ULK1/ULK2 complex and induces autophagy.
  If mTOR is activated, autophagy is inhibited due to inhibitory phosphorylation of
  ULK1 mediated by mTOR. B) A damaged mitochondrion is recognized by the autophagosome
  machinery and engulfed by the autophagosome, subsequently the autophagosome lysosome
  fusion allows the degradation of the mitochondrion and the recycling of healthy
  mitochondria. The figure was created with the help of Biorender.com.
