caption: Interaction between Shigella effectors and the host cell that mediated activation
  and suppressive effects. OspI, Shigella effector encoded by ORF169b on the large
  plasmid and delivered by the T3SS; Ubc13, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that has
  a main role in the NF-κB signal transduction pathway in human infections; TRAF,
  tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated factor; IpaH, invasion plasmid
  antigen H gene sequence; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; GPB, guanylate-binding
  protein; OspB, effector that is secreted through the T3SS; ERK, extracellular regulated
  kinase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; IRAK, interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase;
  MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; IKB, inhibitor of NF-κB
