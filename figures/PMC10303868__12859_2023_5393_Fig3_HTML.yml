caption: Gene-set Enrichment Analysis with Genes Ranked by Hazard Ratio. A Genes can
  be ranked based on the hazard ratio for overall survival (OS). GSEA can be applied
  to examine for similarity in gene features that are shared in high or low-risk diseases.
  Interferon Gamma (B), the LCK Signature (C), and the Cytotoxic signature (D) were
  found to be associated with low-risk patients based on GSEA. Kaplan Meier curves
  showing patients dichotomized based on ssGSEA immune signatures are shown on the
  right in skin cancer patients treated with ICI and validated in a separate cohort
  of patients treated with ipi adjuvant therapy
