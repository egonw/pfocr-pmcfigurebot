caption: Hypothetical role of IRS proteins in BPD development. IGFR, FGF, and TGF-β
  signaling pathways have pivotal roles in BPD. IRS proteins are the common proteins
  of these signaling pathways. In addition to the downstream targets of IRS proteins,
  IRS-related signaling pathway members such as proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB,
  and interleukins inhibit IRS signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylations. These inhibitions
  may have an important role in the development of BPD.
