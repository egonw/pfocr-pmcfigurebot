caption: CRC-CDEs promote tip cell formation of HUVECs. a Western blot detection of
  CD34, integrin β1, and VEGFA in lysis of HUVECs cultured with HCT116-Exo and SW480-Exo
  after 48 h, GAPDH was the internal control of whole-cell lysates. The PBS group
  was a negative control. b Confocal microscopy image of CD34-immunofluorescence in
  HUVECs cultured with HCT116-Exo and SW480-Exo after 48 h. Scale bars = 10 μm and
  20 μm. The intensity of CD34 (right) was measured by Zeiss Zen software. Mean ± SEM.
  Student's t-test, 0.001 < ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. HUVECs incubated with PBS
  were used as a negative control. c CD34 expression in CRC was analyzed from the
  data of GSE71187, 87211, 25071, and 39582. Statistical significance was calculated
  by Student's t-test and Wilcoxon. d CD34 expression in the different stages of lymph
  node metastasis (N0, N1, N2, N3) and distant metastasis (M0, M1) were analyzed from
  the data of GSE39582. Statistical significance was calculated by Kruskal–Wallis
  and Wilcoxon. e The OS and RFS of CD34 in CRC were analyzed from the data of GSE39582.
  Log-rank test was used to estimate the significance. All data of GSE71187, 87211,
  25071, and 39582 were reanalyzed using the BEST (https://rookieutopia.com/)
