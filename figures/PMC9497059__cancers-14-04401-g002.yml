caption: LTG inhibits BC tumor growth by inducing FoxO3a expression. (a) Mice bearing
  BCCs-derived xenografts were treated with LTG at 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day.
  (b) Tumor growth was monitored by caliper, measuring the visible tumor sizes at
  indicated time points. *, p < 0.05 versus control. (c) At the end of experiment,
  tumors were explanted and representative images are shown. (d) Ki67, a marker of
  proliferation index, and FoxO3a expression was evaluated in FFPE sections of tumor
  xenografts deriving from mice treated or not (-) with LTG. NC, negative control.
  (e) Schematic representation of LTG hypothetical mechanism of action in BC. LTG,
  by presumably blocking VGSCs and/or VGCCs or an unknown target, inhibits AKT signaling,
  activating its target FoxO3a, which induces its own transcription and expression
  and, consequently, the expression of its downstream target, PTEN, which, in turn,
  maintains inactive the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus sustaining an antiproliferative autoregulatory
  loop. Results and schemes shown here are adapted from Pellegrino M. et al. [].
