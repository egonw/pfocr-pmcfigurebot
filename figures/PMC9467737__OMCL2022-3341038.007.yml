caption: Siglec-15 knockout inhibits the growth of subcutaneous transplanted tumors
  in mice. (a, b) Six to 8 weeks of wild-type and Siglec-15 KO mice, 200 μL of tumor
  cells was injected subcutaneously, the tumor volume was calculated and statistics
  (n = 10), and the tumor was peeled off and photographed. (c) In the survival curve
  experiment, the survival of mice was observed and recorded every day from the 20th
  day (n = 14). (d) Take mouse lymph nodes and count the tumor nodules in the lymph
  nodes. (e, f) Six- to 8-week-old wild-type mice were selected for macrophage and
  tumor cell co-injection model (200 μL, 1 : 1). The tumor was measured once in 5
  days for recording and stripped and photographed. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p <
  0.001. The experiments were repeated three times, and each experiment was triplicated.
