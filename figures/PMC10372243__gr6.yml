caption: Effects of oridonin on branched-chain amino acid metabolism and the mTOR
  pathway. A. Changes in l-Isoleucine, l-Valine, and Leucine in 4T1 cells after oridonin
  treatment. B. Western blot analysis of the expression of BCAT1, and relative expression
  levels of BCAT1 (**P < 0.01 versus the control group). C. Western blot analysis
  of mTOR, PI3K and AKT expression, and the relative expression levels of mTOR, PI3K
  and AKT proteins (**P < 0.01,****P < 0.0001).
