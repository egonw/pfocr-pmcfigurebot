caption: The marker protein elevation of ferroptosis can be reversed by NK-252. (a,
  b) The level of Nrf2 proteins was significantly increased by coculture with NK-252.
  (a, c, d) The expressions of 4-HNE and PTGS2 were significantly decreased in LTBP2-silenced
  gastric cancer cells after coculture with NK-252. Quantitative data are presented
  as mean s ± SD from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs. the control.
