caption: 'Signal transduction pathways in MM: Interactions of VEGFR and IGF1R with
  their corresponding ligands VEGF and IGF1 leads to activation/phosphorylation of
  PI3K. This sequentially activates PDK-AKT-TSC1/2-mTOR cascade. Similarly, docking
  of GRB-SOS complex in response to activation by upstream molecules activates the
  RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling. The Wnt ligand binds to frizzled activating the
  Wnt-β-catenin pathway. β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus and
  regulates genes involved in adhesion, differentiation, proliferation and migration.
  Axin scaffolds β-catenin to induce proteasomal degradation. NF-kB is activated by
  upstream CD40, TAC1 and LTβR.'
