caption: 'IMP4 overexpression promoted the malignant phenotypes via activating the
  ERK pathway in LUAD cells. ((a) and (b)) The potential pathways which IMP4 could
  regulate in LUAD were analysed using GSEA. (c) After transfection of A549 and H1299
  cells with si-IMP4-1 and si-IMP4-2, the expression of MEK, p-MEK, ERK, and p-ERK
  was analysed using Western blotting. (d) The expression of MEK, p-MEK, ERK, and
  p-ERK in subcutaneous tumour tissues were analysed using Western blotting. (e) Immunohistochemistry
  was applied to assess p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK1 levels in subcutaneous tumour. (f) After
  transfection of A549 cells with pcDNA3.1-IMP4, qRT-PCR was applied to assess IMP4
  levels. After transfection with pcDNA3.1-IMP4 or treatment with SCH772984, in A549
  cell proliferation was evaluated using the CKK-8 (g) and EdU (h); (i) After transfection
  with pcDNA3.1-IMP4 or treatment with SCH772984, A549 cell cycle was assessed using
  flow cytometry. (j) After transfection with pcDNA3.1-IMP4 or treatment with SCH772984,
  A549 cell invasion was assessed using transwell. ∗P  <  0.05, ∗∗P  <  0.01; #P 
  <  0.05, ##P  <  0.01.'
