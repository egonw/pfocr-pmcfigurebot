caption: Integrative multi-omics analysis of PCMR. a Scatterplot of 155 matched proteins
  and surface proteins in PCa versus BPH-derived primary cell samples. 1770 proteins
  were removed due to nonsignificant p-values in proteome. The color represents the
  position of the protein in 4 equal parts of protein abundance, where yellow indicates
  the most abundant. The size of the circle indicates the −log10 (p-value) in proteome.
  P-value and Pearman’s correlation between protein and surface protein abundance
  is shown in the upper left corner of the figure. b, c Volcano plot of the differential
  expression proteins solely identified in proteome data (b) or surface proteome data
  (c). d Number of overlapped DEG/Ps between protein, mRNA, and cell-surface protein.
  Bar plot on the left indicate the total number of associated genes in each type.
  Bar plot on the top show the number of genes in the singleton or intersection groups
  as indicated by the dots below. Genes are filtered by p-value < 0.05 and fold change
  (protein) >1.2 or <0.83, fold change (surface protein) >1.2 or <0.83 and fold change
  (RNA-seq) >1.5 or <0.67. e GSEA pathway enrichment analyses of the RNA-seq and proteomic
  data using hallmark database revealed pathways that are significantly altered (FDR < 0.05)
  in tumors. f, g GSEA (Hallmark gene sets) enrichment of EMT pathway at mRNA or protein
  scale in tumor samples
