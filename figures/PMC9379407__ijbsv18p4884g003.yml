caption: Inhibition of CCL5 restrains proliferation, migration capacities of ccRCC
  cells and chemotaxis of macrophages. (A) Western blotting assay of CCL5 expression
  in transfected A498 and 786O cell lines. The data represent three independent experiments.
  (B) Cell viability of negative control and transfected ccRCC cells using CCK-8 assay.
  (C) Effect of CCL5-siRNA transfection on cell migration was determined using wound-healing
  assay. Histograms and Students's t test were used to evaluate the significance between
  two groups. (D) Correlation of CCL5 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related
  markers in 533 patients with ccRCC from TCGA were detected by Spearson's correlation
  analysis. (E) The linear relationship of CCL5 expression with PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway and tumor proliferation signature by Spearson's correlation. (F) Using Western
  blotting assay, expression of crucial markers in the EMT and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathways were assessed.
