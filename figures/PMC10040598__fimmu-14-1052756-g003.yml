caption: NLRP1 inflammasome and IR. The NLRP1 receptor protein has three active ligands,
  BALT, MDP, and Toxoplasma gondii. After receiving ligand stimulation, NLRP1 receptor
  proteins can undergo a series of intracellular changes, such as K+ efflux, Ca2+
  efflux, proteasome activation, P38 and Akt inactivation, 3C protease cleavage, and
  dsDNA stimulation, thereby activating NLRP1 inflammasome. The NLRP1 inflammasome
  can lead to self-cleavage of pro-Caspase-1 to generate the active form, Caspase-1,
  which subsequently cleaves pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β to generate their mature forms,
  IL-18 and IL-1β, for secretion. In hyperlipidemia-induced metabolic syndrome, IL-18
  inhibits lipid formation and reduces IR. In addition, the NLRP1 inflammasome negatively
  regulated Th17 cell differentiation and ultimately reduced IR by inhibiting RORγT
  in the STAT3 pathway.
