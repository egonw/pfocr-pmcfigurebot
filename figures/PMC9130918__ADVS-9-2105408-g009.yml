caption: CS‐B‐NO hydrogel ameliorated oxidative stress induced by ischemic/reperfusion
  injury via adaptive regulation of the Nrf2‐Keap1 signaling pathway. A) Flow cytometric
  analysis was performed to quantify the number of ROS positive cells in myocardial
  tissue at 1‐day post‐surgery (n = 3 animals per group). B) Mice after I/R injury
  were treated by myocardial injection of CS‐B‐NO hydrogel, and 7 days post‐surgery
  Keap1 S‐nitrosylation of the heart tissues was detected by biotin switch (##p<0.01
  vs Sham, *p<0.05 vs I/R, n = 5 animals per group). C) H9C2 cells were stimulated
  with H2O2 for 24 h and followed by various treatments. Keap1 S‐nitrosylation was
  further detected by biotin switch assay. (####p <0.0001 vs Ctrl, *p<0.05, ***p<0.001
  vs H2O2 stimulated group, n = 5 individual experiments) D) Representative Western
  blot images and quantitative data showing the expression of Nrf2, SOD1, SOD2, HO‐1,
  HO‐2, NQO‐1, and CAT in mice hearts in mice hearts after I/R injury with different
  treatments (n = 5 animals per group). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, Significant
  differences were detected by one‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test,
  *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001. E) Schematic illustration summarizing
  the mechanism of CS‐B‐NO hydrogel on activation of the Nrf2 pathway against oxidative
  stress via enhancing Keap1 S‐nitrosylation.
