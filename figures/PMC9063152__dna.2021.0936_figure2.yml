caption: Treg-derived IL-10 promotes chemoresistance in gastric cancer patients. SGC7901
  (A) and BGC823 (B) cell lines were cultured overnight in NC medium or supernatants
  from Treg cells and then treated with DMSO or 5-Fu. Cell apoptosis was analyzed
  by flow cytometry. (C) The relationship between IL-10 and FOXP3 was analyzed using
  TCGA dataset. SGC7901 (D) and BGC823 (E) cell lines were cultured overnight in NC
  medium or supernatants from Treg cells in the presence of IgG or anti-IL-10 mAb.
  (F) ELISA analysis of the secretion of IL-10 in tumor cells from chemotherapy-sensitive
  and chemotherapy-resistant tumor tissues. (G) Correlation study between IL-10 and
  Kyn in tumor cells from chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tissues
  from gastric cancer patients. (H) Correlation study between IL-10 and Tregs in tumor
  cells from chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tissues. (I) ELISA
  analysis of the secretion of IL-10 by CD4 cells in the presence of DMSO or Kyn.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. TCGA, The Cancer
  Genome Atlas.
