caption: Activated complement system and acute phase proteins(A) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DEPs from cluster 2. The top 20 GO-BP terms are shown.(B) Heatmap depicting expression
  levels of proteins associated with the complement and coagulation cascade pathways
  and acute-phase response pathways in HCs, RSVs, and IDCs.(C) Expression level of
  proteins associated with the complement and coagulation cascade pathways.(D) GO-BP
  enrichment analysis of the DEPs from cluster 2. The top 20 GO-BP terms are shown.(E)
  Expression level of proteins associated with the acute-phase response pathway. The
  square and bars represent the mean and standard deviation, respectively. p values
  were calculated using Student’s t test and significant p values are shown in the
  boxplot. ∗p value < 0.05, ∗∗p value < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p value < 0.001.(F) The interaction
  diagram of proteins and pathways. Yellow squares represent pathways; green circles
  represent altered proteins; dotted lines represent the association between the pathways
  and proteins.
