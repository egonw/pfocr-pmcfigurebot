caption: Vpr enhances STAT5 activation to drive a TRM-like resting memory CD4+ T cell
  phenotype(A) GSEA enrichment plot of the hallmark IL-2 STAT5 signaling pathway for
  HIV-1 WT-infected resting memory T cells versus mock.(B) CD69 expression on infected
  resting memory CD4+ T cells ± ruxolitinib at 72 h (n = 4).(C) CD127 MFI on infected
  resting memory CD4+ T cells ± IL-7 (n = 7) at 72 h.(D) Representative histogram
  of intracellular STAT5 phosphorylation in resting memory T cells infected by cell-to-cell
  spread at 72 h.(E) Quantification of (D) shown as P-STAT5 MFI (n = 10).(F) P-STAT5
  MFI (left) and %P-STAT5+ (right) in Gag+ resting memory T cells 24 h post spinoculation
  with the indicated viruses (n = 12).(G) Representative western blot analysis of
  P-STAT5 and total STAT5 levels in resting T cells at 0 and 24 h post spinoculation
  with HIV-1 WT and ΔVpr virus (n = 2). Values indicate P-STAT5 or total STAT5 levels
  normalized to β-actin and mock at 0 h.(H) Quantification of P-STAT5/STAT5 levels
  normalized to β-actin from western blots of total CD4+ T cells at 24 h post spinoculation
  with HIV-1 WT and ΔVpr virus (n = 4).(I and J) Quantification of (I) P-STAT5 and
  (J) total STAT5 levels by single-cell immunofluorescence analysis of Gag+ resting
  T cells 24 h post spinoculation with HIV-1 WT and ΔVpr virus ± IL-7 (P-STAT5 n =
  1,829–2,000 cells/condition; STAT5 n = 223–900 cells/condition). Normalized mean
  intensities (quantifications) and representative images of P-STAT5 in HIV-1 WT-
  and ΔVpr-infected cells without IL-7 (I, right) are shown. P-STAT5, green; Gag,
  red; Hoechst 33342, blue. Scale bars, 10 μm.(K) P-STAT5 MFI and %P-STAT5+ (right)
  in Gag+ resting memory T cells 24 h post spinoculation with VLPs with or without
  Vpr (n = 7).(L) CD69 (left) and CD69/CXCR6 (right) expression on infected resting
  memory CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-7 ± STAT5-inhibitor AC-4-130 at 72 h (n =
  6). All measurements were made after 72 h or at the indicated time post co-culture
  or spinoculation. Data are the mean ± SEM. Paired two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA
  with Bonferroni or Dunnett’s post test was used. For (I) and (J), median is indicated
  and groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post test. ∗p < 0.05;
  ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; n.s., not significant. MFI, median fluorescence intensity.
