caption: GRIK3 suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling to inhibit the progression of NSCLC.
  A. KEGG pathways analysis was performed in low GRIK3 expression (relative GRIK3
  expression, 0~10, n=393) and high GRIK3 expression (relative GRIK3 expression, 10~1500,
  n=125) patients with NSCLC. B and C. Relative Gil1, Gli2 and Wnt-3a expression in
  vector and A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3 overexpression, as determined by quantified
  PCR. D. Western blotting of Wnt-3a and β-catenin in vector cells and A549/NCI-H1299
  cells with GRIK3 overexpression. E. The relative cell proliferation of vector cells/A549/NCI-H1299
  cells with GRIK3 overexpression that were treated with PBS or FH535 (10 nM). F.
  The colony formation capability of vector cells/A549/NCI-H1299 cells with GRIK3
  overexpression that were treated with PBS or FH535 (10 nM). G. Immunofluorescence
  of Wnt-3a in NSCLC tissues in recurrent (n=15) and non-recurrent (n=15) patients.
  The scale bar was 50 μm. The expression intensity of GRIK3 was calculated.
