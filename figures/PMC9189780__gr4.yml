caption: DNTTIP1 directly downregulates DUSP2 by occupying its promoter. (a) Representative
  heatmaps from global comparative transcriptome analysis indicating genes regulated
  upon DNTTIP1-knockdown. (b-d) The indicated stable cells transfected with the DUSP2-Luc
  reporter for 48h were subjected to the luciferase activity assay. Representative
  data of three independent experiments. Data are represented as the mean ± SD. **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, no significance using Student's t-test. (e-g) The relative
  mRNA levels of the indicated genes were normalized to the GAPDH level in the indicated
  stable cells as determined by qRT-PCR. Representative data of three independent
  experiments. Data are represented as the mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 using
  Student's t-test. (h) The ChIP assay was performed with HK1 cells using an anti-DNTTIP1
  antibody or IgG antibody, as indicated. The RAB20 and ACTIN promoters were used
  as the positive and negative controls, respectively. These results are repeated
  in three independent experiments. (i-k) The indicated proteins were analyzed by
  Western blotting in the indicated stable cells. Western Blot bands were derived
  from three separate experiments but only one representative loading control is shown.
