caption: Improved interconnection model of P. capeferrum WCS358 regulatory systems
  (RclSAR, LasIR and RpoS) in stationary growth phase (improvement of model proposed
  by Bertani and Venturi (2004) [], adapted with permission). Triggering of signal
  transduction pathway starting with RclS activation leads to increased expression
  of the lasI, lasR (this study) and rpoS genes []. Gene regulation network between
  RpoS, LasIR (PpuIR), RsaL and PsrA proteins were described in previous study [].
  Dashed lines indicate indirect gene regulation by RclS sensor kinase.
