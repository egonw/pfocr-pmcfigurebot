caption: 'Knocking down SOX8 and treatment with RO04929097 resensitized Enza-R and
  DU145 cells to enzalutamide, while RO04929097 exerts an antitumor effect on resistant
  cells. (a–d) Enza-R and DU145 cells were subjected to SOX8 knockdown and/or treated
  with RO04929097. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of enzalutamide
  (0, 1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μM) for 48 h, and the half maximal inhibitory
  concentration (IC50) was determined by a CCK-8 assay. (e, f) Enza-R and DU145 cells
  were treated with increasing concentrations of PF-3084014 (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40,
  60, 80, and 100 μM) or DMSO for 48 h. Cell viability was detected by a CCK-8 assay.
