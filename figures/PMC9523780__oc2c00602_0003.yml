caption: Study of the AMPK/mTORC1 signaling pathway by counting single-protein complexes.
  (a) Schematic showing the protein complex in cell lysate is denatured into peptides
  using a common SDS-PAGE preparation protocol. (b) The mass profile of protein complexes
  detected in native cell lysate and denatured cell lysate. Both lysates were diluted
  100 times with PBS and measured for 30 s. Four measurements were performed using
  different sensor chips. The inset shows the total number of detected molecules.
  The error bar represents mean Â± s.d. (c) A brief schematic of the AMPK regulated
  mTORC1 signaling pathway. (d) Normal cells and starved cells were lysed on top of
  an anti-Raptor coated surface. Rcap was determined from n = 29 (on 3 chips) and
  n = 18 (on 3 chips) measurements for normal cells and starved cells, respectively.
  (e) Western blot result showing the Raptor level in normal cells and starved cells.
  (f) Normal cells, starved cells, and AICAR treated cells were lysed on top of an
  anti-phospho-Raptor antibody functionalized surface, with n = 24 (on 8 chips), 29
  (on 4 chips), and 26 (on 5 chips) measurements, respectively. The Rcap values were
  compared. (g) Western blot result showing the phospho-Raptor level in normal, starved,
  and AICAR treated cells. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
