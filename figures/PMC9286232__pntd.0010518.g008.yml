  predicted during L. major infection by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
caption: (A-B) Top 5 differentially regulated canonical pathways and their individual
  heat maps in macrophages following L. major infection. (C-D) Top 5 differentially
  regulated canonical pathways and their individual heat maps in BECs. (E-F) Top 5
  differentially regulated canonical pathways and their individual heat maps in LECs.
  The color intensity represents the degree of expression. A red-green color scale
  was used to reflect the standardized gene expression with red representing high
  expression and green representing low expression. Cut-off values are adjusted p-value
  < 0.05.
