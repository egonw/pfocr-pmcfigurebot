caption: 'ARG restrained cell proliferation and invasion with enhanced apoptosis of
  SiHa cells through suppressing the FAK/paxillin axis. (A) The relative protein expression
  of FAK, p-FAK, paxillin and p-paxillin was examined by Western blot after SiHa and
  HeLa cells were treated with ARG (5, 10 and 20 μM) for 24 h. Data were displayed
  after normalized with GAPDH. *P˂0.05 and **P˂0.01 vs. 0 μM ARG. (B) The relative
  protein expression of FAK, p-FAK, paxillin and p-paxillin was detected by Western
  blot after SiHa cells transfected with FAK overexpression plasmid before the treatment
  of 20 μM ARG for 24 h. Data were displayed after normalized with GAPDH. **P˂0.01
  vs. con; #P˂0.05 vs. FAK. (C) The SiHa cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assays.
  *P˂0.05 vs. con; ##P˂0.01 vs. FAK. (D) The apoptosis of SiHa cells was analyzed
  by flow cytometry. (E) The invaded cell numbers of SiHa and HeLa cells were determined
  by transwell assays. **P˂0.01 vs. con; #P˂0.05 vs. FAK.'
