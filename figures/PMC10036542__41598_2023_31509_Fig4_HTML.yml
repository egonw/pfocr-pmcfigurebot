caption: Transcriptional network module analysis. (A) Perturbation of transcriptional
  network module in varying time points. Major transcription factors are shown in
  red color and target genes are shown in green color. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis
  of genes in early response (5 min) module with KEGG pathways. Red colored bar represents
  up-regulated terms, blue colored bar represents down-regulated terms, and statistically
  insignificant terms are colored in light blue. (C) Venndiagrams show major transcription
  factors and major target genes over time identified by our analysis.
