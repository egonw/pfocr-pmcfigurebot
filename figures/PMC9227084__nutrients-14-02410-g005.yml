caption: 'IHC staining results of ULK1 and p-ULK1 of livers in different groups. (A)
  Representative IHC staining of ULK1 and p-ULK1 in the portal and central venous
  regions. (B,C) The positive staining rates of ULK1 in the portal and central venous
  regions. (D,E) The positive staining rates of p-ULK1 in the portal and central venous
  regions. Scale bar: 200 Î¼m. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Se: selenium;
  ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; p-ULK1: Phosphorylation-modified
  ULK1.'
