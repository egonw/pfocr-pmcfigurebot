caption: Liensinine reduces mitochondrial bioenergetic activity. (a) A549 and SPC-A1
  cells were treated with liensinine as indicated concentrations, and then ATP assay
  kit was used to evaluate the ATP level. (b-c) A549 and SPC-A1 cells were treated
  with liensinine as indicated concentrations, and the genomic DNA was extracted and
  performed LR-PCR and q-PCR to evaluate the mitochondria lesions. Details were shown
  in methods. (d) A heat map was generated after analysis. The relative expression
  of metabolites with significant differences was shown in red (upregulation) versus
  green (downregulation). (e) KEGG pathway analysis for the differential metabolites.
  (f) A549 and SPC-A1 cells were treated with liensinine as indicated concentrations,
  and Western blot assays demonstrated the mTOR, p-mTOR, AMPK, p-AMPK, Beclin1, and
  ULK1 expression. The results were shown as means ± SD, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
