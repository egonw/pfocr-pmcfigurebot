caption: GDF11 treatment significantly affects mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue
  of obese mice and cooperates with WNT/β‐catenin pathway. (A) Heat map showing differences
  in mRNA expression levels in WAT between CTL and GDF11‐treated ob/ob mice (n = 3
  per group). (B) String pathway analysis of genes involved in adipogenesis and lipogenesis
  in sequenced eWAT mRNA as in A. (C) Graphical representation of gene interactions
  by string analysis for WNT/β‐catenin and TGF‐β signaling pathways B. Connections
  between genes are indicating annotated, high confidence (>0.75) molecular interactions
  between genes. (D) mRNA expression levels of selected genes involved in TGF/WNT
  signaling (as in A‐B), adipocyte differentiation and fat metabolism in ob/ob WAT
  (at least n = 7 per treatment group). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (Mann–Whitney
  U test, compared with CTL).
