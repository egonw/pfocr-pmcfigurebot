caption: Diagram of the role of HOTAIR and other lncRNAs in TMZ resistance and hypoxia.
  Hypoxia encourages TMZ resistance through induction of EMT and activation of the
  HIFa pathway. H19 and MALAT1 have been shown to modulate the EMT, while HOTAIR is
  shown here to inhibit HK2 activity in the HIF-1Î± pathway.
