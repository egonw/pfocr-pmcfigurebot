caption: Oxaliplatin suppresses the viability of colorectal cancer cells. (A) Cell
  Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess the effects of oxaliplatin on the viability
  of HT29 cells in the control group and the groups treated with oxaliplatin concentrations
  of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 µM. (B and C) TUNEL assay was conducted to assess the apoptosis
  levels of HT29 cells in the control group and the groups treated with oxaliplatin
  concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 µM. Magnification, x200. Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
