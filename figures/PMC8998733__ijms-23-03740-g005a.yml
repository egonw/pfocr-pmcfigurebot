caption: HNK activated PI3/AKT/mTOR to promoting insulin signaling pathway; meanwhile,
  3-TYP inhibited PI3/AKT/mTOR to suppress insulin signaling pathway. WB and quantification
  of protein band intensity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated (A–D) with HNK or (E–H) with
  3-TYP at various concentrations compared to controls using antibodies in insulin
  signaling pathway. Tubulin and actin were used as loading control and Sirt3 as a
  reference. (A) WB and quantification of protein intensity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated
  with HNK at 1, 5, and 10 µM and control against (A,B) PI3K, IR-β, mTOR, pmTOR, GSK-3β,
  pGSK-3β and (C,D) pFOXO, AKT, pAKT antibodies; (E,F) WB of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated
  with 3-TYP at 50 µM and 100 µM and control against IR-β, mTOR, pmTOR, GSK-3β, pGSK-3β
  and (G,H) PI3K, pFOXO, AKT, pAKT antibodies. Actin as loading controls and Sirt3
  as a reference. Data collected from at least three independent experiments. Statistical
  analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
