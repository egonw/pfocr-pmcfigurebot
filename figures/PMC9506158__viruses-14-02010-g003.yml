caption: ORF45 interactions with host signaling pathways. (A) ORF45 sustains activation
  of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) MAP kinase
  pathway by binding to the ERK/RSK complex and preventing their dephosphorylation.
  ORF45 also acts as a SUMO ligase and SUMOylates RSK to promote its kinase activity,
  which is essential for the phosphorylation of translation initiation complex factor
  eIF4B. RSK activity is also responsible for activation and nuclear accumulation
  of the c-Fos transcription factor, as well as recruitment of RNA polymerase II to
  promoters. RSK-mediated phosphorylation of the mTORC1 inhibitor, the tuberous sclerosis
  complex subunit TSC2, releases TSC2 inhibition to promote mTORC1 signaling during
  lytic infection. (B) ORF45 inhibits interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF7) activation
  and subsequent interferon stimulated gene expression by serving as an alternative
  phosphorylation substrate for upstream kinases TBK1 and IKKε (C) In the absence
  of external stimuli, p53 signaling is inhibited by E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2/MDMX,
  which are stabilized by de-ubiquitinase USP7. Upon an appropriate external stimulus
  (e.g., DNA damage), p53 is released from MDM2/MDMX inhibition and stabilized by
  the binding of USP7, allowing p53 translocation to the nucleus and activation of
  downstream targets. ORF45 inhibits p53 signaling through (i) interaction and sequestration
  of p53 de-ubiquitinase USP7, which leads to p53 ubiquitylation and degradation and
  (ii) direct interaction and cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, which prevents p53
  activation of its downstream transcriptional targets. (D) The hNLRP1 inflammasome
  is inhibited in steady state through interaction of auto-inhibitory domains in the
  Linker 1 region and the UPA component of the FIIND domain. ORF45 interaction with
  the Linker1 domain prevents this auto-inhibition leading to hNLRP1 C-terminal cleavage
  and inflammasome activation.
