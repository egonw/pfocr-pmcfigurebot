caption: 'Glucose metabolism and the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis.
  (A): The metabolic pathway of glucose in neural cells. (B): The ANLS hypothesis.
  Glucose enters astrocytes via GLUT1, which transports to neurons via GLUT3. Astrocytes
  usually perform aerobic glycolysis to convert glucose to lactate, which is exported
  outside the cell via monocarboxylate transporter protein 1 or 4 (MCT1/4) and transported
  to neurons via MCT2. Lactate is then converted to pyruvate in neurons, which is
  used to promote OXPHOS in the mitochondria. Glu, glucose; GLUT, glucose transporter;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; Fru1,6P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  HK, hexokinase; PFKFB3, phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3; F-2,6-P,
  fructose-2,6-diphosphate; PFK1, fructose-phosphate kinase-1; PPP, pentose phosphorylation;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  PKM1, pyruvate kinase 1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase 2; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase 4;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pyr, pyruvate; Lac, lactate; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter;
