  neurophosphatase pathway; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GDF-15, growth
  differentiation factor 15; HDAC4, histone deacetylase 4; IGF-1, insulin-like growth
  factor-1; m TOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; Myostatin, muscle growth inhibitor;
  MEF2, muscle enhancement factor 2; NF-κB, enhanced κ-light chain of nuclear factor-activated
  B cells; P75NTR, neurotrophic factor receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase;
  SRF, serum response factor; down (↓); up (↑); transform (→).'
