caption: Integrated protein networks and associated canonical pathways for proteins
  in MPM models. Integrated protein networks and the corresponding canonical pathways
  were generated. Two networks with network score ≥20 were integrated. For edge information,
  direct and indirect interactions are presented by solid and dashed lines, respectively.
  Canonical pathways associated with proteins in the network are presented as dotted
  lines (light pink). Regarding node information, shapes signify the molecular class
  of proteins defined in the legend, and colours surrounding the nodes represent expression
  patterns for each disease type. Overlapping proteins between MPM models are denoted
  by an asterisk. Each protein is presented as a gene name and the corresponding protein
  entry in parentheses. Alterations in protein expression are presented as fold‐change
  for each disease type. MDD, major depressive disorder; BD, bipolar disorder; SCZ,
  schizophrenia; CP, canonical pathway; MPM, multiprotein marker

  disorders: Applications for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.'
