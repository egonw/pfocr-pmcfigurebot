caption: Examples of SVM models represented in two dimensions using nearest neighbors.
  Red dots represent drugs annotated to the term, while blue dots represent the opposite;
  black dots represent drugs for which no annotations were found in ChEMBL or CTRPv2
  (unlabeled drugs). (a) Representation of the SVM model of regulation of ERK1 and
  ERK2 cascade. CP-724,714, MET kinase inhibitor, PD 153035 and WZ4002 are unlabeled
  drugs. (b) Representation of the SVM model of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
  in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. ABT-737, apidicin and camptothecin
  are unlabeled drugs. (c) Representation of the SVM model of spindle organization.
  Thapsigargin, triptolide, SB-743921 and GW84368X are unlabeled drugs.
