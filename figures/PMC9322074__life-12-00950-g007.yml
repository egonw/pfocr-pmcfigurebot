caption: The effect of melatonin on UVB-induced JNK phosphorylation in HDFs. The cells
  were pretreated with 1 µM of melatonin for 1 h, further irradiated with 0.1 J/cm2
  of UVB for 6 s, and then incubated for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h in cell culture medium containing
  1 µM of melatonin. (A) JNK activation in UVB-irradiated groups; (B) JNK activation
  in UVB-irradiated after 1 h of melatonin pretreatment; a representative image from
  three independent Western blotting experiments is included.
