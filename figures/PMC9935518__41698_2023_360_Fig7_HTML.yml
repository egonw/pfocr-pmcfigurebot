  ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer patients
caption: Phosphoproteomic-based quantification of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity in tumor
  samples using the LCM/RPPA workflow allows to identify patients with high pathway
  activation that may benefit from the addition of a PI3K inhibitor to sensitize resistant
  tumors to ET in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition.
