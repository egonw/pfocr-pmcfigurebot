figure_title: Xrn1 Tail binds RNA
caption: a Tail binds RNA. Cells expressing 6xHis-TEV cleavage site-Protein A (HTP)
  tagged Tail, or control cells carrying no tag, were UV crosslinked. Tail-HTP-RNA
  complex was affinity purified, the co-purified RNAs trimmed and labelled with 32P
  and the protein-32P-RNA complexes were separated in denaturing PAGE. Upper panel,
  autoradiogram (32P-RNA); bottom panel, Western blot using anti-His antibodies. b
  Some mutations in Tail (indicated above each lane) affect its RNA binding capacity.
  Affinity purification of the indicated Tail mutants, which had been crosslinked
  to RNA, was performed as in A. The RNA and protein levels were quantified as described
  in Methods. RNA levels were normalized to the protein level. WT is arbitrarily defined
  as 1. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.) of 2 replicates. p-values were
  determined by two-tailed unpaired t-test. c Tail provides a major RNA binding site
  of Xrn1 which acts in conjunction with the R101 residue of the active site. FLAG-tagged
  Xrn1, or it’s indicated mutant derivatives, were affinity purified (see Methods),
  and subject to a gel-shift assay using 32P-5’-RNA (a mixture of 40, 32 and 28 b
  long), in the presence of EDTA to inactivate the enzyme (see Methods). Increasing
  amounts of purified proteins were used as indicated. Control lane represents experiment
  in which the probe was reacted with elute from untagged cells. Quantification of
  3 biologically independent experiments is shown at the bottom. Error bars represent
  standard deviation (S.D.). The results of WT Xrn1 reacted with 400 µM was defined
  arbitrarily as 1. Purified Xrn1 was run in parallel to verify equal amount of protein
  loading. Shown is a Coomassie blue straining (middle panel). d RNA bound by Tail
  is highly correlated to Xrn1 RNA interactome. Tail and Xrn1 were subject to a full
  CRAC analysis. RPKM values of RNA binding to Tail and Xrn1 were scatter plotted.
  Two independent biological replicates are shown. Pearson’s correlation (r) is indicated.
