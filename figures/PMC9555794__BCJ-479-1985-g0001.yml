figure_title: Resistance to Ras targeted therapies is rapidly induced and results
  in stable rewiring of Ras effector pathways
caption: (A) Representative plots including technical replicate data points of drug
  responses in resistant vs naïve NCI-H358 cells. (B) Acute treatments of naïve cells
  with IC90 concentrations of inhibitor re-dosed every 48 h results in rapid re-activation
  of Ras effectors. Where re-dosing or cell harvesting occurred on the same day, e.g.
  4 days, cells harvested at day 4 will have been re-dosed 48 h previously. High levels
  of Ras pathway activation are maintained in resistant cells even after drug washout
  with vehicle. (−) cells treated with vehicle control, (R) resistant NCI-H358 cells
  continuously cultured for at least 30 days in the presence of drug, (N) naïve NCI-H358
  cells. Blots are representative of n = 3 biological repeats.
