caption: Joint pathway analysis of DIABLO-selected (A) metabolites and transcripts
  mapped to only metabolic pathways, (B) metabolites and proteins mapped to only metabolic
  pathways, (C) metabolites and transcripts mapped to all pathways, and (D) metabolites
  and proteins mapped to all pathways. Red points on the graph indicate a more significant
  pathway p-value.
