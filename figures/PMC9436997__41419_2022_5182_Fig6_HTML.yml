figure_title: Ivermectin targeted to Ku70/Ku80
caption: A Volcano plot of melting point difference calculated from the ivermectin
  versus DMSO controls in living 22RV1 cells. Blue circles represent significant melting
  temperature differences and red circles show all remaining proteins. B KEGG and
  GO pathways by KOBAS showed the enrichment pathway of the proteins with the melting
  temperature difference (ΔTm) more than ±3 °C. C Melting curves for Ku70/Ku80 generated
  from mass spectrum in 22RV1 cells. D, E Western blots showing thermostable Ku70/Ku80
  following indicated heat shocks in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 50 μM ivermectin
  in LNCaP (D) and C4-2 (E) cells.
