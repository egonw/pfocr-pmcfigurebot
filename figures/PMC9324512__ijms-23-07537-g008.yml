caption: A proposed model of the PsnWRKY70-mediated regulatory network response to
  Alternaria infection in Populus. PsnWRKY70 indirectly activated PTI pathway genes,
  including MAP kinase cascades, calcium channel proteins, calcium-dependent protein
  kinases, and SA pathway-related genes. It directly binds to the promoters of homologous
  genes and induces the expression of PsnWRKY6, PsnWRKY18, PsnWRKY22, PsnWRKY22-1,
  and R genes in the ETI pathway. The gray represents that PsnWRKY70 indirectly regulates
  genes. The purple represents that PsnWRKY70 directly regulates genes.
