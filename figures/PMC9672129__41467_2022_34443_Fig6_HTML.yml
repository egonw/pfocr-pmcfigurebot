figure_title: Influence of CNTF on metabolic gene expression and enzyme activity
caption: a–d Transcriptome analysis of WT retina and rds retinas treated with LV-IG
  or LV-CNTF from P25-P35. Heatmaps show relative transcript levels (average of N = 3,
  each N contains two retinas). a Glycolytic pathway enzymes and Mpc2. b Mitochondrial
  Pdha1, Pdhb, and TCA cycle enzymes. c Participants of mitochondrial biogenesis.
  d Nuclear genome encoded mitochondrial respiratory chain components. Asterisks indicate
  genes with decreased transcripts compared to WT. e Western blot analysis of retinal
  extracts from WT retina and rds retinas treated with LV-IG or LV-CNTF from P25-P100.
  Bar graphs show the quantification of CNTF signaling effector pY705 STAT3 and total
  STAT3, the active pY10 LDHa and LDHa. For e, data were presented as mean ± SEM.
  Independent retinal samples (N = 3) and adjusted P values based on one-way ANOVA
  and Tukey all-pairs test are indicated.
