caption: P and Zn concentrations in lateral root (LR) mutants of maize. LR mutants
  ll1 and sl1 were grown in a hydroponic solution containing different combinations
  of P and Zn for 7 days. A Representative images of whole root systems and primary
  roots of ll1 and sl1. Scale bars = 1 cm. B Total root length, primary root length,
  total root length of 1° LRs, and density of 1° LRs of ll1 and sl1. Values are means
  ± SD (n = 12). C P and Zn concentrations in the roots of ll1 and sl1 mutants. Values
  are means ± SD (n = 4). Means with the same letter are not significantly different
  at P < 0.05 according to the LSD test
