figure_title: Pathway enrichment of distinguished metabolites
caption: a Venn diagram depicts overlap in upregulated metabolites at T24 versus Pre
  and upregulated metabolites at T48 versus Pre. Fold change >1.5. b Venn diagram
  depicts overlap in downregulated metabolites at T24 versus Pre and downregulated
  metabolites at T48 versus Pre. Fold change <0.67. c The enrichment of top 20 metabolic
  pathways according to the identified distinguished metabolites at four time points
  by MetaboAnalyst (v5.0).
