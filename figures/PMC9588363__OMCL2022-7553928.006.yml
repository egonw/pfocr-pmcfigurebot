caption: Among the UUO mice, miR-214-3p downregulation alleviated renal interstitial
  fibrosis via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis. (a) qRT–PCR outcomes for the miR-214-3p expressions
  in the UUO, sham, UUO + LV − NC − KD and UUO + LV − miR − 214 − KD groups, and the
  internal reference miRNA was U6. (b) Histopathological changes were observed by
  Masson staining and HE staining. Typical images of each group are shown in the figure.
  Blue–purple collagen was deposited on the Masson-stained image. Scale bars, 100 μm.
  (c) Statistical Masson staining results were expressed by semiquantitative analysis
  of the collagen deposition area. (d, e) qRT–PCR outcomes for the mRNA expressions
  of PTEN, COL1, FN, and α-SMA. For other genes, the internal reference used was GAPDH.
  (d–f) Western blot results of PTEN, PI3K, p-AKT, t-AKT α-SMA, COL1, and FN protein
  levels in all groups. In the results analysis, t-AKT and GAPDH served separately
  as the internal references for p-AKT and other proteins. (i, k) Typical immunohistochemical
  images of PTEN and PI3K. Scale bars, 100 μm. (j, l) The levels of PTEN and PI3K
  were expressed by semiquantitative analysis of the positive staining area. Data
  are rendered in terms of means ± SDs. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001 against the UUO/control group.
