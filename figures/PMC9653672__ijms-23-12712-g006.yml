caption: Schematic diagram of the RIOK2 gene regulating the cytotoxic effects induced
  by DON in IPEC-J2. DON enters the small intestines of pigs by ingesting cereals
  infected with Fusarium. RIOK2 is highly expressed during DON exposure and improves
  cytotoxicity resistance by affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, antioxidant
  capacity, and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in IPEC-J2. Moreover, the
  transcription factor Sp1 regulates the expression of RIOK2 by binding to the promoter
  region. This mechanism determines the action of RIOK2 in the responses of IPEC-J2
  to DON exposure. Created with BioRender.com.
