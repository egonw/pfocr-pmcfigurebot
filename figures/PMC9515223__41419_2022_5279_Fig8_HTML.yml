figure_title: A diagram illustrates the roles of HOXA5 and MXD1 in the pathogenesis
  of ECCA
caption: HOXA5 directly induced the expression of MXD1 by binding to the MXD1 promoter
  region. The up-regulated MXD1 expression indirectly enhanced the p53 signaling to
  inhibit the proliferation of ECCA cells. HOXA5 could induce the apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma
  cells, but have no significant effect on their invasion ability.
article_title: HOXA5 inhibits the proliferation of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  cells by enhancing MXD1 expression and activating the p53 pathway.
