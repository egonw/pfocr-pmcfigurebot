caption: Graphic representation of mouse hippocampus protein network 1, identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) as being affected by both sham irradiation and
  1H irradiation. Functions associated with the network include developmental disorder,
  hereditary disorder, and metabolic disease. The network is overlayed with the disease
  and function tool to display the 3 key molecules involved with behavior. The node
  color indicates expression value, and color intensity indicates degree of upregulation
  (red) or downregulation (green). Gray nodes are dataset molecules that were not
  significantly expressed and therefore did not pass the IPA analysis cutoff. Uncolored
  nodes were not part of our dataset but were incorporated into the pathway based
  on evidence stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Known direct and indirect interactions
  between network proteins, as well as the direction of the interaction, are indicated
  by arrows or blocked lines.
