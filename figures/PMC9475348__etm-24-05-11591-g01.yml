caption: Secretion of inflammatory factors by human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem
  cells in the presence of LPS. (A) The levels of (Aa) IL-6 and (Ab)TNF-α were measured
  using ELISA. (Ac) Commercial NO kit was utilized to measure the release of NO. (B)
  The levels of IL-10 were measured using ELISA. The experiments were representative
  of at least three independent trials, each with three technical replicates. The
  error bars represent the standard deviations. ***P<0.001. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NO, nitric oxide; NS, not significant.
