caption: Integrative pathway enrichment analysis using the mutated gene list in the
  CGC set and the association between altered pathways and patients’ survival. (A)
  Dysregulated pathways were mainly related to NOTCH signaling, chromatin organization,
  and SUMOylation damage. Red-coded nodes represented as the significantly dysregulated
  pathways, and the significance was marked by color intensity. The size of the node
  represents gene set size (number of genes documented in each pathway). The edges
  (gene overlap size), represented as the associations between pathways and the thickness,
  were used to present the associated level. (B) Progression-free survival for cases
  with and without dysregulated pathways. (C) Univariate Cox regression analysis of
  dysregulated pathways upon progression-free survival; p-value < 0.05 is considered
  significant.
