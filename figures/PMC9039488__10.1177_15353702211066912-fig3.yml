caption: Gene expression levels of ROS detoxification molecules in macrophages differentiated
  from ML-1 cells. (a) and (b) Gene expression levels of GCLC and GCLM involved in
  the synthesis of GSH, were significantly increased in response to treatment with
  400 nM CDDO-IM for various times. (c) to (e) NQO1, HO-1, and GR gene expression
  were also significantly increased in the in response to similar CDDO-IM treatment
  for 12 h. The relative mRNA was evaluated by real-time PCR and data were normalized
  using GAPDH (data represent mean ± standard errors of the mean, n = 3. *p < 0.05
  vs control). The differences between treatments were measured by one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. (A color version of this
  figure is available in the online journal.)
