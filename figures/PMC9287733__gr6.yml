caption: 'Model V: Release of sequestration of sMaf and ARE by nuclear BACH1 exportation.
  (A) Structure of Model V, containing stressor S-induced nuclear exportation of BACH1n
  (k1), nuclear importation of BACH1c (k2), reversible binding between BACH1n and
  sMaf (k3 and k4), reversible binding between NRF2 and sMaf (k5 and k6), transcriptional
  activation of an ARE Target gene by NRF2-sMaf and its competitive inhibition by
  BACH1n-sMaf (k7, Kd7, Ki7), and degradation of the protein product of the Target
  gene (k8). (B-C) Simulated steady-state dose-response of free sMaf, free BACH1n,
  NRF2-sMaf, BACH1n-sMaf, and Target gene expression as indicated, when the model
  operates in titration mode (B) where k3 = 0.1, k4 = 0.01, and total BACH1 = 100,
  thus BACH1n-sMaf is the dominant form of nuclear BACH1, or in equilibrium mode (C)
  where k3 = 0.01, k4 = 0.1, and total BACH1 = 10000, thus free BACH1n is the dominant
  form of nuclear BACH1, respectively. None of the variables exhibit ultrasensitivity.'
