figure_title: The methylation profile of the HOXA5 gene in ECCA
caption: A Heatmap analysis of the methylation and expression level of the HOX genes.
  The gradual changes from red to white represent changes in gene expression from
  high to low. Green, no CpG island. Blue, 1 CpG island. Red, 2 CpG islands. B, C
  RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses of HOXA5 expression in ECCA cells following treatment
  with, or without, DCA. D, E Analysis of the methylation profile of the HOXA5 gene
  in GSE49656 and GSE38860 of GEO database. The purple box represents the cancer samples
  and the blue box represents the non-tumor samples. F Bubbles plotted the KEGG analysis
  of the methylation levels of differential genes. The gradual changes from red to
  blue represent the changes in high to low FDR. The sizes of bubbles represent the
  numbers of genes enriched in certain terms. G The methylation profile of the HOXA5
  gene from the BSP results. The black solid represents methylated sites and the hollow
  points represent unmethylated sites. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001.

  cells by enhancing MXD1 expression and activating the p53 pathway.
