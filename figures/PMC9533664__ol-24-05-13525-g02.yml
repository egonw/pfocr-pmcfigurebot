caption: 'Effect of glucose and mannose-related sugar binding sites on the Con A-mediated
  regulation of cell migration and viability. (A) Microscopic images of three liver
  cancer cell lines in a Transwell Boyden Chamber (scale bar, 100 nm). The quantification
  of (B) HCCLM3, (C) MHCC97L and (D) HepG2 cells in a Transwell chamber was calculated
  manually by counting the number of cells. (E) Viability of HCCLM3 cells treated
  with Con A after co-incubation with glucose or mannose for 6 h. (F) Viability of
  HCCLM3 cells treated with Con A after co-incubation with DMEM for 6 h. (G) Microscopic
  images of HCCLM3 cell migration in a Transwell chamber (scale bar, 100 nm). (H)
  Migration of HCCLM3 cells treated with Con A after co-incubation with DMEM for 6
  h. The data were expressed as the mean ± SD (n=6). **P<0.01 vs. the control group,
  #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. the Con A group. Con A, concanavalin A (10 µg/ml); GLU,
  glucose; MAN, mannose.'
