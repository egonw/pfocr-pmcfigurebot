caption: Increase in antioxidant capacity and decrease in accumulation of ROS in C.
  elegans after p-AKK treatment. (A) Results of ROS labeling and detection after treating
  L4 nematodes with different bacteria for 24 h. N = 3. (B–D) SOD, CAT and GSH-PX
  content in L4 nematodes after feeding with different bacteria for 24 h. N = 3. The
  results are expressed as the mean ± SD and p-values were calculated by Duncan’s
  tests. Significant differences between groups are expressed by different letters
  (a–c) (p < 0.05).
