caption: The relationship between MAP kinase Hog1 and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways.
  (A) Transcriptional profile of cAMP/PKA-pathway-related genes in MAT-1 and ss1hog1Δ.
  The transcription levels of genes SsGPA3, SsUAC1, and SsADR1 in the cAMP/PKA pathway
  were detected in the MAT-1 and ss1hog1Δ. NS denotes a not statistically significant
  difference (p < 0.05). The sample was independently performed with three independent
  biological repeats, each of which contained two replications. (B) The phosphorylated
  levels of PKA in MAT-1, ss1adr1Δ, and ss1hog1Δ strains. Total protein was extracted
  from the fresh haploid sporidia under YePSA medium. The phosphorylated PKA was detected
  with the primary antibody Phospho-PKA C and the total level of SsAdr1 was determined
  with anti-Adr1 antibody by Western blot analysis. (C) Transcriptional profile of
  SsHOG1 was detected in MAT-1, ss1gpa3Δ, ss1uac1Δ, and ss1adr1Δ. NS denotes a not
  statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). The sample was independently performed
  with three independent biological repeats, each of which contained two replications.
  (D) The phosphorylated levels of SsHog1 in MAT-1, ss1hog1Δ, ss1gpa3Δ, ss1uac1Δ,
  and ss1adr1Δ strains. Total protein was extracted from the fresh haploid sporidia
  under YePSA medium. The phosphorylated Hog1 was detected with the primary antibody
  Phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) and the total level of SsHog1 was determined with
  anti-Hog1 antibody by Western blot analysis.
