caption: 'Protein–protein interaction analysis of intersecting targets, and a database
  analysis of key targets in the Hedgehog pathway. (a) Protein–protein interaction
  network diagram. The PPI data were downloaded from the Spring database and visualized
  using Cytoscape; the red nodes are the core targets of the Hedgehog pathway, and
  the blue nodes are other intersection targets. (b) Oncomine database analysis. Box
  plots derived from gene expression data in Oncomine comparing the expression of
  SHH, Gli1, Gli2, Ptch1, and SMO genes in normal (left plot) and breast cancer tissues
  (right plot). (c) Kaplan–Meier analysis. Kaplan–Meier plots showing the overall
  survival in breast cancer. In red: patients with expression above the median; in
  black: patients with expressions below the median.'
