caption: The viability of J82WT and J82‐IDH2ox cells was assessed by WST assays under
  treatment with GEM, mizorubine, GEM with mizorubine, leflunomide, or GEM with leflunomide.
  The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates). Comparisons
  were made with respect to the corresponding controls or the indicated groups, followed
  by analysis with Student's t‐test. **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001. n.s., non‐significant.Complete
  heatmap showing the intracellular levels of metabolites in J82‐IDH2ox cells treated
  with AGI6780. For each cell line, data for three individual biological replicates
  are shown, and the levels were normalized to those in J82‐IDH2ox cells.Major metabolites
  in the glycolytic pathway altered in J82‐IDH2ox cells treated with AGI6780 compared
  with untreated J82‐IDH2ox cells. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3,
  biological replicates). The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological
  replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05.Levels of intermediate
  metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics
  in J82‐IDH2ox cells treated with AGI6780 relative to untreated J82‐IDH2ox cells
  based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs
  (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05,

  and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. **P < 0.01.PPP metabolite levels based on
  targeted CE‐MS metabolomics in J82‐IDH2ox cells treated with AGI6780 relative to
  untreated J82‐IDH2ox cells. The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3,
  biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001.Relative
  dCTP level based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics in J82‐IDH2ox cells treated with
  AGI6780 compared with untreated J82‐IDH2ox cells. The data are shown as the mean
  values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student's t‐test.
