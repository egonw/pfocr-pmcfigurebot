caption: CTGF promotes HSCs activation via the EGFR receptor mediated p38/p65 signaling.
  AML-12 cells were transfected with control siRNA or Smad4 siRNA, respectively, and
  treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, the conditioned medium was
  collected to treat LX-2 cells. (A,B) The mRNA levels of α-SMA and Col1a1 in LX-2
  cells were measured using the real-time PCR method. (C) Western blotting analysis
  of α-SMA protein levels in LX-2 cells. α-SMA was normalized to GAPDH. (D) LX-2 cells
  were treated with recombinant CTGF protein (0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL)
  for 48 h. Western blotting analysis of protein levels of α-SMA in LX-2 cells. α-SMA
  was normalized to GAPDH. (E) LX-2 cells were treated with 200 ng/mL recombinant
  CTGF and 10 ug/mL CTGF-neutralizing antibody (Anti-CTGF) for 48 h. Western blotting
  analysis of protein levels of p-p38, p38, p-p65, p65, and α-SMA in LX-2 cells. p-p38
  and p-p65 were normalized to p38 and p65, respectively, and α-SMA was normalized
  to GAPDH. (F) LX-2 cells were treated with 200 ng/mL recombinant CTGF and 10 nM
  Erlotinib for 48 h. Western blotting analysis of protein levels of p-p38, p38, p-p65,
  p65, and α-SMA in LX-2 cells. p-p38 and p-p65 were normalized to p38 and p65, respectively,
  and α-SMA was normalized to GAPDH. (G) Western blotting analysis of protein levels
  of p-p38, p38, p-p65, and p65 in fibrotic liver tissues. p-p38 and p-p65 were normalized
  to p38 and p65, respectively. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
