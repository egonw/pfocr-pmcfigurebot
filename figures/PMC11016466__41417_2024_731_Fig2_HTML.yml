figure_title: RanGAP1 promotes proliferation of colorectal cancer
caption: A The intervention effect of RanGAP1 knockdown and RanGAP1 overexpressed
  in CRC cells. Bâ€“E CCK8 assays and colony formation assays showed the proliferation
  ability of silencing and overexpressing RanGAP1 on CRC cells. F, G Flow cytometry
  assays showed the effects of silencing and overexpressing RanGAP1 on the cycle of
  CRC cells. H, I Injection of modified RanGAP1 knockdown DLD1 cells in nude mice.
  J Volume of tumors were recorded every four days. K Xenografts from nude mice were
  measured. L Weight of tumors in each group. M The proteins levels of RanGAP1 and
  ki67 were quantified.
