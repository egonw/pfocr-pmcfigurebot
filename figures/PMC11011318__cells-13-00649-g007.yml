caption: 'Mechanisms of NUCC-555-mediated effects in blocking liver fibrosis progression.
  The present studies showed clear evidence that antagonizing activin A signaling
  in hepatocytes and HSCs promotes liver regeneration and impairs fibrosis progression.
  Another pathway, in which activin A directly activates Kupffer cells to secrete
  of TNF-α and TGF-β1 causing HSC activation [], could also be blocked by NUCC-555.
  HCs: hepatocytes, HSCs: hepatic stellate cells, KCs: Kupffer cells.'
