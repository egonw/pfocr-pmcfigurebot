caption: mTOR signalling pathway. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2, which in turn
  modulate several downstream osteogenic pathways. Acute rapamycin treatment inhibits
  mTORC1 whilst repeated dosing of rapamycin also inhibits mTORC2. Both mTORC1 and
  mTORC2 are activated by Wnt and IGF. mTORC1 is also activated by BMP2 and mTORC2
  is also activated by mechanical and chemical signals to promote osteogenesis.
