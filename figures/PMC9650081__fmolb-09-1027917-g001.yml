caption: The signaling pathways for inflammasome activation in rheumatoid arthritis.
  Overexpression of TNF-α in the synovial macrophages of rheumatoid arthritis joints
  leads to activation of the classical NF-κB pathway, which leads to activation of
  the transcription factor RelA. RelA constructively regulates the expression of NLRP3.
  In conclusion, a higher level of NLRP3 expression results in more robust activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
