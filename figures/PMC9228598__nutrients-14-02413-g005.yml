caption: 'Functional relationship between autophagy and apoptosis induced by resveratrol
  (RSV) in A549 cells. Cells were incubated with RSV (30 or 80 μM) alone or in combination
  with 5 mM 3-MA or 30 μM Z-VAD-FMK for 48 h. (A) AO (1 μg/mL) staining of autophagic
  vesicles. Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry (APC); (B) TUNEL-FITC/PI
  staining was used to detect the percentage of apoptosis cells. The data are presented
  as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 compared with the control
  group. ^^ p < 0.01 compared with 30 μM RSV group. ## p < 0.01 compared with 80 μM
  RSV group.'
