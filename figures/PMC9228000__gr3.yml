caption: 'The Exposome Meets Allostatic Load: The Impact of Structural Racism as an
  Integration of Environmental and Biologic Study in Community-based ResearchWhile
  the psychological stress of chronic experiences of interpersonal racism and discrimination
  may trigger the stress pathway (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) over time yielding
  dysfunction of cortisol diurnal patterns, structural racism simultaneously influences
  inequitable impacts to environmental factors such as decreased access to greenspace,
  and increased exposure to pollutants. Specifically, chronic cortisol may over occupy
  glucocorticoid receptors which feedback to the central HPA axis and with time may
  result in decreased ability of the axis, via cortisol, to respond to acute stress
  which may manifest as a shortening of cortisol dynamic range (CDR). Taken together,
  the totality of these exposures, known as the exposome, joins the allostatic load
  burden of imbalanced physiology across multiple systems to yield health disparities
  in mental and physical illness, inclusive of commonly comorbid illness known to
  bidirectionally link to cortisol dysregulation such as depression and cardiometabolic
  disease. If population health research is inclusive of biological, environmental,
  and subjective psychosocial metrics n design, potentially with the use of community
  field workers and participant-led sample collection, outcomes will be more likely
  to align toward a common goal of multi-layered solutions into achieved health equity.'
