caption: SALL4 regulates angiogenesisin vitro. A-D CCK-8 assays were used to assess
  cell proliferation after a 48-hour treatment. E-H Transwell migration assays were
  performed on HUVECs treated with CM from si-Ctrl/si-SALL4-B or Vector/P-SALL4-B
  gastric cancer cells. I-L Tube formation assays in si-Ctrl/si-SALL4-B or Vector/P-SALL4-B
  CM-treated HUVECs. The results are presented as the means ± standard error of mean
  (SEM). **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001

  and targeting SALL4/VEGF pathway inhibits cancer progression.
