caption: The hypothetical model of diterpenoid synthesis regulatory network associated
  with A. vilmorinianum. In cytoplasm, acetyl CoA forms IPP through MVA pathway. In
  MVA pathway, HMGS gene is regulated by mir6300. In plastids, glycolide 3-phosphate
  and pyruvic acid form IPP through MEP pathway. IPP molecules are condensed into
  farnesyl pyrophosphate, and farnesyl pyrophosphate is regulated by FDP regulatory
  pathway to complete terpene skeleton synthesis. GGPPS enters the diterpene metabolic
  pathway through the interaction of CDPS, KS and KO genes, and forms aconitine and
  its derivatives through the interaction of transcription factors and CYP450. Finally,
  aconitine and other diterpenoid alkaloids were synthesized
article_title: De novo RNA sequencing and analysis reveal the putative genes involved
  in diterpenoid biosynthesis in Aconitum vilmorinianum roots.
