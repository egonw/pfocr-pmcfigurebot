caption: Correlation of patient survival with mRNA expression of IL-6 pathway components.
  Overall survival of patients suffering from HNSCC, ovarian cancer, breast cancer,
  or metastatic melanoma is evaluated for patients with different levels of IL6 mRNA
  expression (top) and IL6ST mRNA expression (bottom). Survival of the patients with
  the highest gene expression (4th quartile, Ntop patients) was compared with the
  survival of the patients with the lowest expression (1st quartile, Nbottom) using
  Kaplan–Meier curves and the log-rank test. The analysis was performed within the
  Xena platform [].
