figure_title: Effect of the circIPO7-caprin-1 complex on the mRNA translation of EGFR
  and mTOR
caption: A GC cells with vector- or circIPO7-overexpression were treated with CHX
  for different times (0 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h), and then lysed to detect the protein
  levels of EGFR and mTOR by western blot. B, C Ribosomal profiling analysis of EGFR
  mRNA (b) and mTOR mRNA (c) distribution in GC cells with vector- or circIPO7-overexpression.
  D The effects of circIPO7 or/and caprin-1 overexpression on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  were analyzed by western blot. E CCK-8 analysis of the effect of circIPO7 or/and
  caprin-1 overexpression on GC cell proliferation. F Schematic model depicting the
  mechanism of circIPO7 in suppressing GC cell proliferation. In GC cells, caprin-1
  interacts with G3BP1 and enters the translation initiation complex, facilitating
  the translation of its target mRNAs (EGFR, mTOR). Overexpressed circIPO7 could competently
  bind caprin-1 with G3BP1, and then block the recruitment of caprin-1 along with
  its target mRNAs to 40 S ribosomal subunit, leading to the inhibition of their translation
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activation, thus suppressing GC cell proliferation ultimately.
