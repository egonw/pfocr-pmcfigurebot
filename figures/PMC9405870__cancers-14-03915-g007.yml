caption: FAM107A affects PCa cell proliferation through FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. (A)
  Enrichment results of the KEGG pathway suggest that FAM107A may be involved in PCa
  progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. (B) Western blotting analysis of p-FAK
  expression and expression of downstream signaling pathway proteins p-PI3K and p-AKT.
  (C) AKT activator SC79 could partially restore the inhibition of cell proliferation
  ability after FAM107A overexpression. (D) The CCK-8 experiment was used to compare
  the proliferation activity of PC3 and DU145 cells in different groups. (E) An immunofluorescence
  assay was performed to detect the expression of Ki67 in each group of cells at a
  magnification of 400Ã—. ** for p < 0.01, and * for p < 0.05.
