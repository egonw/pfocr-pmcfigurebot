caption: T-96 inhibited LSD1-mediate cell signal in the highly metastatic TNBC SUM-1315
  cells. (a, b) T-96 inhibited LSD1 and its target protein expression by Western Blot;
  (c, d) LSD1 increased Histone H3K4 and Histone H3K9 methylation by Western Blot;
  (e, f) LSD1 inhibited PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathway. Values are statistically
  significant at âˆ—P < 0.05.
