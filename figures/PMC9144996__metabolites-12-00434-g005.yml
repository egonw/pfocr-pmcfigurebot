caption: 'Enzyme synergy effects in a linear pathway with alternative routes. The
  (scaled) synergisms towards a fitness-relevant objective (e.g., biomass production)
  can tell us about epistasis. (a) network structure. A conversion from S to S can
  occur directly or via the intermediate S. The following plots show synergy effects
  for double inhibitions predicted by FBA (b) or MoMA (c). To simulate enzyme inhibitions,
  a flux decrease to 90 percent of the original value was imposed by setting a bound
  at 0.9 times the unperturbed reaction flux. The double inhibition of an enzyme is
  simulated by applying the inhibition twice, i.e., leading to a relative flux decrease
  factor of 0.81. Synergy effects are shown by line colours (red: aggravating, blue:
  buffering) and as a matrix. Colour ranges span the observed synergy effects in each
  panel (red: negative; white: zero; blue: positive). Small values, below one percent
  of the maximal absolute value, are not shown. (d) Synergy effects computed by Metabolic
  Control Theory, assuming common modular rate laws and half-saturated enzymes. A
  model ensemble with saturation values sampled from uniform distributions yields
  almost the same results on average. Also a different rate law (the simultaneous
  binding modular rate law) yields very similar results (see ). Compare  for synergy
  effects in E. coli.'
