caption: HIF-1α couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. HIF-1α/VEGF and Notch signal
  pathways are pivotal in coupling Type H vessels angiogenesis and BMSCs osteogenic
  differentiation, in which matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibitor 1 (MMP2-I1) and Osteostatin
  (OST) play a positive regulatory role. In addition, the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway also
  promotes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Osterix, inhibits peroxisome proliferators-activated
  receptors (PPARγ), promotes BMSCs osteogenic differentiation, and participates in
  the occurrence of osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and bone defect.
