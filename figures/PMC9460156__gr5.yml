caption: Fecal microbiome functionality alterations in recipients after FMT, in association
  with post-FMT body weight loss(A) Alterations in the functionality of fecal microbiome
  during the 1-month FMT period and after FMT at the DNA level. The abundance of metabolic
  functions (pathways) was profiled via HUMAnN2 based on the metagenomic dataset.(B)
  Alterations in the functional activity of fecal microbiome during the 1-month FMT
  period and after FMT at the metatranscriptional (RNA) level. The expression level
  of metabolic functions (pathways) was profiled via HUMAnDornorN2 based on the metatranscriptomic
  dataset. Metabolic pathways differentially associated with body weight change were
  identified via LASSO and plotted in the heatmap. Only those significant pathways
  included in the LASSO regression model were plotted.(C) Longitudinal expression
  profile of the metabolic pathway, phosphopantothenate biosynthesis I, in recipient
  microbiome after FMT at the metatranscriptional level. The expressional contribution
  to this pathway was stratified by constituent bacteria.
