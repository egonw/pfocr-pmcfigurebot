caption: Identifying the contribution of ryanodine and IP3 receptors to increases
  in [Ca2+]i in hippocampal astrocytes in response to the addition of MSC-EV. (A)
  Exposure to MSC-EV at a concentration of 2.4 × 108 particles/mL in a calcium-free
  medium supplemented with 0.5 mM EGTA and 100 µM carbenoxolone (CBX), an inhibitor
  of connexin hemichannels. (B) Addition of MSC-EV at a concentration of 2.4 × 108
  particles/mL after depleting the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ reserves by adding 1
  µM of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA).
  (C, D) Additions of MSC-EV at a concentration of 2.4 × 108 particles/mL with 100
  µM ryanodine (Rya), a ryanodine receptor antagonist (C) or 10 µM U73122, an inhibitor
  of phospholipase C (D). Typical Ca2+ signals from astrocytes are presented. Astrocytes
  were distinguished from neurons by the absence of fast Ca2+ signals in response
  to 35 mM KCl, while exhibiting a high-amplitude Ca2+response to the addition of
  10 µM ATP. For this single experiment, representative Ca2+ signals are shown. The
  experiments were performed in the 6 technical replicates per 3 independent cell
  cultures.
