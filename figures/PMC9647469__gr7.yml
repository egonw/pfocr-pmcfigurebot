caption: 'DDT increased the cell viability and inhibited IL-1β release in CoCl2-induced
  PC12 cells. (A) The neurotoxic effect of CoCl2 with different concentrations (31.25,
  62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) for 24 h was determined by an CCK8 assay. (B)
  After 24 h incubation with CoCl2, IL-1β level was measured by Elisa. (C) After treatment
  with DDT and/or CoCl2, cell viability of PC12 was assessed by an CCK8 assay. (D)
  IL-1β level was measured using an Elisa assay kit. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p <
  0.001 vs. Ctrl group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. CoCl2 model group.'
