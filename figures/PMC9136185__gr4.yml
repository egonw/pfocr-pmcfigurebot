caption: 'Effect of the FAM83D-mediated AKT/mTOR pathway on the invasion and migration
  abilities of glioma cells. A, Transwell assays were conducted to determine the invasive
  abilities of U87 and U251 cells; B, Comparison of the invaded cell numbers between
  U87 cells and U251 cells; C, Wound healing tests were conducted to determine the
  migration abilities of U87 and U251 cells; B, Comparison of the wound closure between
  U87 cells and U251 cells; * P < 0.05 vs. the Mock group; # P < 0.05 vs. the siFAM83D
  group; & P < 0.05 vs. the FAM83D group; % P < 0.05 vs. the MK2206 group.'
