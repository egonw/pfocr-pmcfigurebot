caption: The effect of phosphate starvation on the metabolism of B. licheniformis.
  (A) Crude biopolymer yield of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876, OETB and OETE. (B) Crude
  biopolymer yield of B. licheniformis cultured under different concentrations of
  phosphate. (C) Analysis of gene expression in the phosphate starvation response
  pathway of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876 and OETB. (D) Analysis of gene expression
  in the teichuronic acidsynthesis pathway of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876 and OETB.
  (E) Analysis of gene expression in the phosphate starvation response pathway of
  B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876 and OETE. (F) Analysis of gene expression in the teichuronic
  acidsynthesis pathway of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876 and OETE. (G) Analysis of gene
  expression in the phosphate starvation response pathway of B. licheniformis CGMCC
  2876. (H) Analysis of gene expression in the teichuronic acid synthesis pathway
  of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876. (I) Analysis of gene expression in the osmotic stress
  response pathway of B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876. Relative expression was determined
  by 2-△△Ct, *p < 0.05 versus 2876.
