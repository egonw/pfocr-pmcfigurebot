caption: The inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway blocks
  the effect of α-phellandrene on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.
  (A,B) Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) were either treated with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide;
  DMSO) or 12.5 μM of α-phellandrene for 6 h (for mRNA analysis) or 24 h (for protein
  analysis) and pretreated with vehicle or 50 μM of SQ22,536 (cAMP inhibitor) for
  1 h before α-phellandrene treatment. Then the mRNA was extracted and qPCR analyses
  were performed for VEGF expression changes. Each sample’s mRNA level was normalized
  to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and expressed relative to the
  value of the control (vehicle). The VEGF protein levels were normalized to the total
  amount of cellular protein. Results are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean
  (SEM) of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences are
  marked as ns, not significant (p > 0.05); * p < 0.05.
