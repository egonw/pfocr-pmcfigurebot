figure_title: Cardiomyocyte‐specific Pkm2 (pyruvate kinase M2) deficiency activated
  RAC1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein)‐MAPK signaling pathway in the progression
  of heart failure
caption: A and B, Western blot and quantification of phosphorylation of p38, p38,
  p‐ERK, ERK, phosphorylation of JNK, and JNK in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated
  with si‐Pkm2 for 72 hours. β‐actin served as loading control. C through F, Western
  blot and quantification of p‐p38, p38, p‐ERK, ERK, p‐JNK, and JNK expression in
  heart tissues from Pkm2 conditional knockout and Pkm2f/f mice 6 weeks after sham
  or transverse aortic constriction surgery. β‐actin served as loading control. Minimum
  of n=6 per group. cKO indicates conditional knockout; Pkm2, pyruvate kinase M2;
  RAC1, rho family, small GTP binding protein; p‐p38, phosphorylation of p38; and
  p‐JNK, phosphorylation of JNK. Values represent as the mean±SEM; **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  ****P<0.0001.
