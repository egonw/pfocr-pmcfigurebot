caption: GSEA results of three subtypes. (A) Ten up-regulated and ten down-regulated
  biological pathways were selected from the shared enriched pathways in three subtypes
  tumor samples. (B) Top 15 biological pathways that specific up- and down-regulated
  in Subtype 1 tumor samples. Wnt signaling pathway was significantly up-regulated
  in Subtype 1. (C) Top 15 biological pathways that specific up- and down-regulated
  in Subtype 2 tumor samples. Glycogen metabolism biological pathway was significantly
  down-regulated in Subtype 2. (D) Top 15 biological pathways that specific up- and
  down-regulated in Subtype 3 tumor samples. Neutrophil-mediated immunological pathways
  were down-regulated in Subtype 3. (FDR <0.05).
