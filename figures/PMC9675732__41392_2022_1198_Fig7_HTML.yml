caption: 'The roles of PD-L1 scFv and 4-1BB intracellular domain on the functional
  improvements of PD-L1.BB.CSR-modified CAR-T cells. a Heatmap of selected DEGs in
  HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB, HER2.28ζ/PD-L1, HER2.28ζ, PD-L1.BB CAR-T and UTD cells at 24 h
  post-stimulation with irradiated SKOV3PD-L1 cells. b Heatmap of selected DEGs between
  PD-L1.BB CSR-T and UTD cells at 12 h and 24 h post-stimulation. c GSEA of IFN-γ,
  TNF-α, and mTORC1 signaling pathway, as well as mitosis genes in PD-L1.BB CSR-T
  and UTD cells at 24 h post-stimulation. d Heatmap of DEGs between HER2.28ζ/PD-L1
  and HER2.28ζ CAR-T cells at 24 h post-stimulation. e GSEA of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α,
  IL-6 signaling pathways in HER2.28ζ/PD-L1 and HER2.28ζ CAR-T cells at 24 h post-stimulation.
  f Heatmap of selected DEGs between HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB and HER2.28ζ/PD-L1 CAR-T cells
  at 24 h post-stimulation. g GSEA of IFN-γ signaling pathway, T cell activation genes,
  E2F target genes and stem cell memory pathway in HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB and HER2.28ζ/PD-L1
  CAR-T cells at 24 h post-stimulation. h The schematic diagram of repeated-stimulation
  experiment. At days 0 and 2, CAR-T cells were stimulated with irradiated SKOV3PD-L1
  cells at E: T ratio of 2:1, and at day 6, CAR-T cells were sorted by human CD3 magnetic
  beads for functional test i, j, m, n. The cytotoxicity of post-stimulated CAR-T
  cells was analyzed by CCK-8, after 24 h of co-culture with SKOV3PD-L1 cells at indicated
  E: T ratios i, and effector cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) secretion in culture
  supernatant was detected by ELISA j. k At days 1, 2, 4 and 6 of repeated-stimulation
  experiment, the proliferation folds of CAR-T cells were quantified by flow cytometry
  using absolute counting bead. l Statistical analysis of 4-1BB expression on CD4+
  and CD8+ CAR-T cells on day 1 of repeated-stimulation experiment. m, n Statistical
  analysis of CD45RO+CCR7+ TCM cells m, PD-1+ and PD-L1+ expressions on CD4+ and CD8+
  CAR-T cells n at day 6 of repeated-stimulation experiment. Representative RNA-seq
  pictures shown in 2 replicates. P-values were determined by unpaired two-tailed
  t-test i–n. *P <0.05, **P <0.01, ns, not significant. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD from three independent experiments'
