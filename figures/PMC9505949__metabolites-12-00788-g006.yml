caption: mTORC1 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of SCs proliferation
  and protein synthesis by lysine. (A) Cell proliferation; (B) representative images
  of cell protein synthesis levels with Western blotting; (C) representative images
  of phosphorylation levels of mTORC1 signaling pathway-related proteins with Western
  blotting. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. The data shown represent mean Â± SEM of three
  independent experiments (n = 3).
