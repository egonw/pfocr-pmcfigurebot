figure_title: The RLCK-VII-5 subfamily functions downstream of multiple primary CLEp
  receptors
caption: '(a) RLCK-VII-5 kinases control phloem differentiation through CLE45p/BAM3
  signaling pathway. Representative confocal images of 5-day-old-seedling meristems
  (n≥15 independent biological replicates). In pbl34 mutants differentiated phloem
  files could be observed frequently, which was never observed in Col-0 wildtype.
  bam3 and rlck-vii-5 are CLE45p-resistant. White asterisks: phloem cell files. (b-c)
  RLCKV-VII kinases control CLE40p/BAM1/BAM2/POL mediated QC division. CLE40p triggers
  QC division dependent on RLCK-VII-5 kinases and BAM1 BAM2; while untreated pol displays
  ectopic QC divisions mimicking CLE40p treatment (b) Representative pictures of confocal
  microscopy of 5-day-old seedlings treated or not with 100 nM CLE40p. black: calcofluor
  white cell wall staining. (c) Corresponding quantification of QC division phenotypes
  in control or 100 nM CLE40p treated plants. n=15–32 independent biological replicates.
  (d-e) rlck-vii-5 mutants display a mild extra carpel phenotype by itself and enhances
  the clv1 single mutant. (d) Representative images of carpels per flower with white
  asterisk indicating a carpel and (e) table representing the average number of carpels
  per flower (±SD) for every flower on the primary inflorescence of 30 individual
  6-week-old plants per genotype and the percent distribution of carpel number per
  flower.'
