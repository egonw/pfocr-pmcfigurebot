caption: A brief summary of the medical history and comprehensive molecular-genetic
  analysis. (A) Patient timeline of key clinical events and laboratory test results.
  (B) The patient was born with four Fanconi anemia (FA) gene mutations and germline
  predisposition to cancers. She developed ovarian cancer, and then the altered FA
  pathway plus exposure to cytotoxic drugs promoted the emergence of acquired somatic
  mutations and the NUP98-HOXC11 fusion, all of which contributed to the development
  of secondary t-CMML. (C) Potential biological mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis
  of t-CMML.
