caption: 'qPCR assay. We analyzed the gene expression of MAP2, NEFL, NEFH, NEFM, CNP,
  Tuj1, and GFAP by qPCR. The gene expression of most neuronal markers was increased
  with HDAC inhibitor treatment compared to RA treatment. The mRNA expression was
  normalized to the RA-treated cells. GAPDH was used as a control. All experiments
  were repeated at least three times. ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 compared to the
  RA group'
