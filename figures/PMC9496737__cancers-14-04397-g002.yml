caption: Restoration of miR-200c in mesenchymal-like EO771 murine mammary cancer cells
  restores a more epithelial phenotype. (A) Representative images of the change in
  morphology of EO771 cells in the presence of miR-200c. Cells were stained with DAPI
  and visualized by microscopy (n = 2, with 10 fields of view). (B) Relative gene
  expression of miR-200c and Zeb1 by qRT-PCR analysis following treatment with miR-200c
  mimic or scrambled oligo is shown. Data were normalized to either U6 or Gapdh and
  are presented as fold change relative to the scrambled oligo. (C) Western blot analysis
  revealed downregulation in Zeb1 protein levels with miR-200c restoration. GAPDH
  was used as a loading control. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified
  the top 15 altered “Hallmark” pathways along with their respective normalized enrichment
  score (NES). Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highlighted in red. (E)
  Heatmap of the top altered genes from the Hallmark-EMT pathway that were altered
  by miR-200c restoration. Each column represents an individual biological replicate
  of EO771-TripZ-EV (Vehicle-treated, n = 3) or EO771-TripZ-miR-200c (+doxy, n = 3)
  for 72 h. Asterisks (*) indicate similarities found in Mak et al. [], a published
  human pan-carcinoma EMT signature. Genes depicted as Z-scores.
