caption: Effects of exposure to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush
  on the mRNA expression of ECM factors in gingival fibroblasts. HGnFs were exposed
  to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush for 7 days. The mRNA expression
  of ECM factors (a–l) was quantified using real-time PCR. Each bar indicates mean
  ± standard deviation (SD) of five independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  (vs. control).
