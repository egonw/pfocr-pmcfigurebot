caption: 'Bulk RNAseq reveals distinct transcriptomic features in subpopulations of
  myeloid lineage cells from the interface tissue. Cells from the interface tissue
  on day 1 and 14 after ACLR surgery were sorted (see Materials and Methods; n = 2,
  five to seven mice pooled for each sample). (A) PCA plot showing segregation of
  F4/80− cells, CD9+ macrophages, CX3CR1 macrophages on day 1 and 14 after ACLR surgery.
  (B) Cluster dendrogram. (C) Heat map showing expression of DEGs divided into 8 groups
  by k‐means‐clustering. Averaged CPM values are z‐score‐transformed. Right panels:
  violin plots of expression of genes in groups 1–8. (D) Pathway analysis using canonical
  pathway data sets of IPAs. (E) Heat map of expression of genes in inflammation,
  wound healing, leukocyte migration, and defense response to virus pathways. IPA
  = ingenuity pathway analysis.'
