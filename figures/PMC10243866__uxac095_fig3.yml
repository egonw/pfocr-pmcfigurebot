caption: AIM causes crosstalk between lipid metabolism and inflammatory response.
  AIM in the blood increased obesity induced adipocytesâ€™ lipolysis and triggers the
  efflux of saturated FFA to stimulate the TLR4 pathway, which triggers adipocytes
  to produce pro-inflammatory chemokines. For example, MCP-1 induces recruitment of
  M1 macrophages/monocytes into adipose tissue, ultimately leading to adipose inflammation
  and insulin resistance [].The human AIM may contribute to macrophage-endothelial
  cell adhesion, which is an unprecedented function of this protein, requiring further
  investigation of this phenomenon []. symbolize promotion.
