caption: Cytotoxic activity of NK cells against WT cell lines (G401 and SK-NEP-1).
  Labeled G401 and SK-NEP-1 cells were incubated with NK cells derived with cytokines.
  Results are expressed as mean (SEM) percent of cytotoxicity at various E:T ratios.
  For comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in multiple
  groups. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
