caption: 'Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) regulates tumor cell proliferation by modulating
  the expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in prostate
  cancer. Decrease in the levels of FOXA1 and AR lead to an increase in IGFBP-3 expression,
  thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. IGFBP-3 can suppress the biology
  of IGF-1 utilization, as well as inhibit the interaction between IGF-1 and the IGF-1
  receptor, thereby exerting tumor-suppressive effects. Increased IGFBP-3 following
  FOXA1 depletion restrains the phosphorylation of signaling mediators, including
  MAPK and Akt, in the IGF-1 signaling pathway, thereby mediating cell cycle blockade
  in prostate cancer cells through p21 and p27. AR: androgen receptor; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.'
