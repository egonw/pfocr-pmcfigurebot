caption: 'Mifepristone shows atypical modulation of the unfolded protein response.
  (A): RMG1 cells were incubated with vehicle (DMSO) or 20 μM of mifepristone and
  samples were harvested at 1, 3, 6, 10 and 24 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected
  to immunoblotting and probed with the antibodies for several proteins in the unfolded
  protein response pathway. 2.5 μM of CB-5083 and 2 µM of TN (Tunicamycin) treated
  for 24 h were analyzed as positive controls. β-Actin was used as a loading control.
  (B): RMG1 cells were incubated with media (0), DMS0 (D), different doses of mifepristone
  (between 5 μM and 80 μM), 2.5 μM of CB-5083 and 2 μM of tunicamycin (TN). All samples
  were incubated for 18 h, and protein lysates were immunoblotted with several antibodies
  for proteins in the unfolded protein response pathway. β-Actin was used as loading
  control. (C): RMG1 cells were incubated with increasing doses of mifepristone (5–80
  µM) with 2 μM of tunicamycin for 10 h. Cells were harvested, and proteins were subjected
  to immunoblotting to analyze the indicated proteins. (D): RMG1 cells were incubated
  with increasing doses of CB-5083 (1–5 µM) with or without mifepristone (20 µM) for
  6 h. Cells were harvested, and proteins were subjected to immunoblotting to analyze
  the indicated proteins. β-Actin was used as a loading control. All experiments were
  performed in at least two biological replicates. Uncropped immunoblots can be found
  in .'
