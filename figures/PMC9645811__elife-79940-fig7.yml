figure_title: ATM mediates the protection from FLT3 inhibition by human bone marrow
  stromal cell (hBMSC-CM) upstream of mTOR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation
caption: '(A) MOLM-13 cells were treated with vehicle, 3 nM quizartinib, 10 nM everolimus,
  and combo in RPMI or hBMSC-CM for 15 hr and harvested to determine the levels of
  total and phosphorylated ATM by Western blotting. (B) MOLM-13 cells were transduced
  with lentiviruses-expressing shRNAs (shNT: nontargeting shRNA; or shATM: ATM-targeting
  shRNA). Cells were treated with either vehicle or 3 nM quizartinib (Quiz) for 48
  hr in RPMI or hBMSC-CM, followed by measurement of apoptosis (n = 3). (C) MOLM-13
  cells expressing shNT or shATM were treated with the indicated conditions for 15
  hr and harvested for Western blot analyses. (D) MOLM-13 cells expressing shNT or
  shATM were treated with the indicated conditions for 15 hr, followed by measurement
  of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) by Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test (n = 4). (E)
  Model of ATM and mTOR-dependent survival of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  cells following FLT3 inhibition in BM microenvironment. In the absence of BM stroma,
  FLT3-ITD AML cells undergo apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition as a result of downregulation
  of ATM and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity (left). In the presence of BM stroma,
  on the other hand, FLT3-ITD AML cells are protected from cell-killing effects by
  FLT3 inhibition (right). As indicated by orange arrows, the BM stroma-mediated protection
  is driven by ATM through regulation of mTOR protein levels, as well as mTORC1 activity
  via AKT, subsequently leading to partial restoration of translation. Restored mTORC1
  activity selectively drives translation of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs that
  promote cell survival even in the presence of FLT3 inhibition. The BM stroma-mediated
  protection against apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition is reversed with combinatorial
  treatment with everolimus, which inhibits mTOR signaling and downstream processes
  including polysome enrichment and selective translation of oxidative phosphorylation
  mRNAs, and oxidative phosphorylation. Effects of drugs that target FLT3 (quizartinib)
  or mTOR (everolimus) are represented with red or blue, respectively, arrows and
  Xs. Figure 7—source data 1.Unedited raw blots for  are shown.  Figure 7—source data
