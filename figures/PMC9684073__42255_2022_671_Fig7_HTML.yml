figure_title: Nrg4 inhibited NF-κB signal in vivo and in vitro
caption: AAV-Nrg4 or AAV-Zsgreen at a dose of 1 × 1012 viral genomes were injected
  into the BAT in the interscapular region of KO mice at aged 6 weeks and then were
  fed WD or NCD for 12 weeks. a, KEGG pathway analysis indicated the altered function
  of NF-κB signaling pathway. b, Heat map of the NF-κB pathway and apoptosis-associated
  genes. c, The expression levels of NF-κB signaling in MAECs of KO and WT mice. d,
  The expression levels of NF-κB signaling in MAECs of KO and WT mice with or without
  the overexpression of Nrg4. e, Quantitative analysis of c (n = 6). f, Quantitative
  analysis of d (n = 6). g, The expression of p65 and P-p65 in MAECs nucleus or cytoplasm
  under the presence or absence of rNrg4. h, Quantitative analysis of g (n = 5 independent
  experiments). I, The p65 nuclear translocation in MAECs. Scale bar, 50 μm. P values
  were calculated by two-sided Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison
  test. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. *P < 0.001.
