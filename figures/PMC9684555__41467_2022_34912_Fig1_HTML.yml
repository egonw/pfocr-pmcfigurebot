figure_title: Conversion of 4-alkylphenols to 4-hydroxyphenyl alkenes and 4-hydroxyphenyl
  alcohols by vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) and lignin-based synthesis of isoeugenol
  as fragrance, flavor or precursor of other high-value products
caption: The upper panel shows the mechanism by which VAO oxidizes 4-alkylphenols.
  The lower panel shows the catalytic pathway, which includes an engineered EUGO,
  by which lignin can be converted into valuable products.

  isoeugenol from a lignin-derived compound.
