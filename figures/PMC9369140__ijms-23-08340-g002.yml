caption: Differential analysis of carotenoids in the striped and green leaves of B03S.
  (A) Heatmap analysis of the main differentially accumulated metabolites of the carotenoid
  pathway. (B) The main differentially accumulated metabolites in different metabolic
  branching of the carotenoid pathway. CK, fully green leaves; Z-G, zebra-green striped
  in leaves/alternate green leaves; Z-Y, zebra-yellow striped in leaves/alternate
  yellow leaves. The arrow points to Related metabolites contents related to xanthophyll
  cycle.
