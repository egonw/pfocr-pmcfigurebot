caption: Proposed model depicting miRNA-mediated tolerance or susceptibility due to
  low light intensity stress in low-light-tolerant and -sensitive rice genotypes.
  Among identified differentially expressed miRNAs in tolerant and sensitive rice
  genotypes, three known and five novels were selected. Upregulated miRNAs show downregulation
  of their respective targets and vice versa. Results indicate that miRNAs are expressed
  in such a way that their respective targetsâ€™ expression involved maintaining photosynthetic
  and metabolic pathways to cope with low light stress in tolerant rice genotypes,
  but sensitive rice genotypes were unable to maintain it.
