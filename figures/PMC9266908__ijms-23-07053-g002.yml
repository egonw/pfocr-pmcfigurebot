caption: Cytotoxicity curves of hydroxytyrosol during 12 and 24 h in Jurkat cells
  (A); 12, 48 and 72 h in HL60 (B) and Raw264.7 at the same three times (C). The assays
  were performed using three independent populations of cells. Results expressed as
  μg·mL−1 are mean ± SEM. IC80, IC50 and IC20 values for the Jurkat, HL60 and Raw264.7
  lines after 12, 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation with hydroxytyrosol and are indicated
  in the tables below the graph. These results were obtained by a dose–response model
  using OriginPro 8 software (OriginLab®, Northampton, MA, USA). IC, inhibitory concentration.
