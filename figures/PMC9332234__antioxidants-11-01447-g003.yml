caption: Crosstalk between Nrf2 and stem cells for targeting stroke-induced inflammation.
  This figure exemplifies local (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and microglia)
  and peripheral (spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow) inflammatory and oxidative
  stressors due to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The use of Nrf2 pathway amplification
  concurrent with stem cell therapy can enhance the efficacy of stem cell treatments
  to reduce secondary cell death following stroke.
