  ZO-1/Occludin expression through GLP-1RA treatment. (a) Western blot analysis of
  retinal albumin leakage in four groups. (b, c) Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
  analysis of retinal MMP-9/VEGF/ZO-1/Occludin expression in four groups and histogram
  comparisons (40×). Annotation: compared with the normal group, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p <
