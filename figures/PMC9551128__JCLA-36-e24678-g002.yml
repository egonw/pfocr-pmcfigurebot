caption: 'JUP downregulation impaired ICAT‐induced migration and invasion in CRC cells.
  (A) ICAT‐overexpressing SW480 and vector control cell lines were transfected with
  siRNA against either JUP or a negative control for 24 h. Western blotting was performed
  to analyze the expression of JUP and ICAT in transfected cells. GAPDH was used as
  a loading control. (B) Wound healing assay was performed in the indicated SW480
  cells. Representative images (left; scale bars: 100 μm) and quantitation for the
  extent of wound healing (right). (C) Transwell assay (left; scale bars: 100 μm)
  shows the migration and invasion of the indicated cells. The number of migrated
  cells (right) groups were counted. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.'
