caption: Visualization of flux differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
  metabolic reactions between severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients
  and healthy humans. The main differential metabolic pathways were shown in different
  block colors. The arrow color and thickness indicated the degree of flux difference.
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Nucleotide, nucleotide/purine/pyrimidine metabolism;
  MAS, malate-aspartate shuttle; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation; FA, folate metabolism; Retinol, retinol metabolism and transport;
  LacCer, lactosylceramide metabolism and transport; Gln, glutamine transport.
