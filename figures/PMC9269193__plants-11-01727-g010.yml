caption: The schematic representation of the hormonal and molecular genetic regulation
  of cambium activity in woody plants. The TDIF signal peptide is produced in the
  phloem and migrates to the cambium, where it binds to its TDR receptor. The TDIF/TDR
  signaling activates WOX4 by regulating cambium cell proliferation [,,]. TDIF binding
  to TDR activates GSK3 (BIN2) and leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of
  the BES1 protein. BES1 promotes xylem differentiation and also suppresses WOX4 expression,
  so its degradation preserves cambium pluripotency []. The TRD acts as a suppressor
  of another GSK3â€”BIN2-LIKE 1 (BIL1). BIL1 in the absence of TDR phosphorylates the
  auxin-dependent transcription factor of ARF5, releasing it by weakening the interaction
  of ARF5 with the AUX/IAA repressor []. Phosphorylation of ARF5 enhances its activity
  in suppressing the cytokine response through the expression of ARR7/15 and leads
  to a decrease in cambium proliferation []. Auxin signal transduction in cambial
  stem cells is required to maintain cambial activity []. The level of auxin signal
  transmission increases in the differentiating xylem. High concentrations of auxin
  promote the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors,
  releasing ARF5 to regulate xylem differentiation. ARF5 autonomously limits the number
  of stem cells by downregulating the WOX4 activity and increasing the HB8 gene expression,
  positively influencing xylem differentiation [].
