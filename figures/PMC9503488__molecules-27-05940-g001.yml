caption: Effect of adrenergic agonists on the migration of Hep3B and MDA-MB-231 cells.
  (A–D) Hep3B human HCC cells (A,C) and MDA-MB-231 human BC cells (B,D) suspended
  in serum-free media were seeded onto the inserts of transwell plates and treated
  with either E or NE or ISO at 0.1–10 μM. Medium containing 10% FBS was filled in
  the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. After 24 h of incubation, the migrated
  cells were stained and photographed (×100 magnification). (A,B) Representative images
  from triplicate analyses are shown. (C,D) Relative migration was calculated by counting
  the stained cells. (E–H) Confluent cell layers of Hep3B human HCC cells (E,G) and
  MDA-MB-231 human BC cells (F,H) were scratched for the wound-healing assay. The
  cells were then treated with either E (10 μM) or NE (1 μM) or ISO (10 μM) in serum-free
  medium. (E,F) Wound closure was photographed immediately, and at 24 h and at 48
  h post-wound generation (×50 magnification). Representative images from triplicate
  analyses are shown. (G,H) The proportion of wound closed was calculated. The data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Significance was
  determined by the Student’s t-test (ns, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 vs. untreated controls). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; BC, breast
  cancer; E, epinephrine; NE, norepinephrine; ISO, isoprenaline.
