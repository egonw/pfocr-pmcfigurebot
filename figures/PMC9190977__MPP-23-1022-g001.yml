caption: Salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway genes were highly expressed in the
  AGH17470‐transgenic citrus. (a) The phenotypes of AGH17470‐transgenic citrus shoots.
  The wild‐type citrus plants were also generated as negative control images 1–5.
  Images 6–10 are positive transgenic lines of 1–5. (b) Confirmation of the AGH17470‐transgenic
  citrus by reverse transcription‐PCR. M, DL2000 marker; +, positive recombinant plasmid
  control; −, negative control of empty vector. Lanes 1–5 lanes show wild‐type citrus
  lines 1–5; lanes 6–10 show AGH17470‐transgenic citrus lines 1–5. (c) Validation
  of the transgenic lines by β‐glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining. Tubes 1–5
  are negative controls and tubes 6–10 are positive transgenic lines of 1–5. (d) Reverse
  transcription‐quantitative PCR analysis of pathogenesis‐related (PR) genes and SA
  signalling pathway‐related genes in different transgenic lines. The CsGAPC1 gene
  was used as an endogenous control. Error bars indicate standard errors of means,
  and the letters represent significant differences among samples by one‐way analysis
  of variance followed by least significant difference post hoc tests at a p =0.05.
  All experiments were repeated three times
