caption: 'Effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on NF-κB signaling pathway in IVDD rats. (A) The
  expression of NF-κB p-p65 was detected by Western blot; *p < 0.05, vs control group;
  #p < 0.05, vs IVDD group. (B) The nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by immunofluorescence
  assay. Data were presented as mean ± SD from each rat (control group: n = 8; IVDD
  group: n = 10; L-Rg1 group: n = 10; M-Rg1 group: n = 10; H-Rg1 group: n = 10). Magnification,
  400×; scale bar, 20 μm.'

  IL-1β-induced nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
