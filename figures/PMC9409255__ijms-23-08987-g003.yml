caption: PERK pathway in apoptosis induction. Upon ER stress, PERK activation results
  in the inhibition of global protein synthesis. At the same time, translation of
  ATF4 transcription factor will in turn lead to induction of CHOP. ATF4/CHOP heterodimer
  will be responsible for the upregulation of different genes involved in the control
  of cell death by apoptosis.
