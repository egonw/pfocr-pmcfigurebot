caption: Graphic abstract. Yinzhihuang oral liquid effectively alleviated steatosis,
  inflammation, and fibrosis, reduced serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase,
  and improved glycolipid metabolism of NASH mouse. Meanwhile, YZH treatment significantly
  decreased the abundance of harmful bacteria, such as Mucispirillum, Helicobacter,
  and Desulfovibrionaceae. Mechanistically, YZH reduced gut leaky, decreased serum
  LPS, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, and increased IL10 in serum. In the liver, YZH decreased
  MCP-1, IL-1β and alleviated macrophage infiltration, especially pro-inflammatory
  macrophages. Moreover, YZH inhibited the canonical TLR4, MyD88, NFκB signaling pathway.
