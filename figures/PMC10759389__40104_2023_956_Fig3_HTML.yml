caption: Significantly changed pathways (−log10(P) value > 1.5) in distal colon digesta
  oligosaccharide-based polymer groups and 50 mg/kg of carbadox on d 5 (A) or d 11
  (C) post-inoculation. The x-axis represents the pathway impact values and the y-axis
  represents the −log10(P) values from the pathway enrichment analysis. Metabolite
  set enrichment analysis (B and D) shows the metabolic pathways were altered in 10
  or 20 mg/kg oligosaccharide-based polymer active substance groups compared to carbadox
  on d 5 or d 11 post-inoculation, respectively. Both pathway analysis and metabolite
  set enrichment analysis were performed using identified metabolites with VIP > 1
article_title: Impact of an oligosaccharide-based polymer on the metabolic profiles
  and microbial ecology of weanling pigs experimentally infected with a pathogenic
  E. coli.
