caption: 'Effects of QYDP on the expression of hub genes and PI3K-AKT pathway genes
  in DN mice. (a) The relative expression of PPARG, TNF, VEGF-A, PI3K, MAPK3, JUN,
  INS, ALB, and AKT were detected by qRT-PCR. (b) The protein expression of PPARG,
  VEGF-A, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT were detected by western blot.  ∗P < 0.05,
   ∗ ∗P < 0.01, and  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001
  vs. model group; $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01, and $$$P < 0.001vs. high-dose QYDP group.'
