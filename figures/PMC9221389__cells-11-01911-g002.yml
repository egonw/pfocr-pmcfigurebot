caption: DEGs analysis of scRNA-seq data. (A) Volcano plot of changes in CD45+ total
  leukocyte gene expression in the heart on day 1 post-MI; and (B) for day 3 post-MI;
  (C) for day 7 post-MI. Red dots denote genes with log2 FC > 1 and p < 0.05; blue
  dots denote genes with log2 FC < âˆ’1 and p < 0.05. (D) Line chart of S100a8 and S100a9
  expression change after MI in the scRNA-seq data. The diamond line represents S100a8,
  and the square line represents S100a9. (E) Venn diagrams of significant DEGs detected
  in infarct group vs. normal group at 1, 3, and 7 days post-MI.
article_title: Integrated Analysis Reveals S100a8/a9 Regulates Autophagy and Apoptosis
  through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway in the Early Stage of Myocardial
  Infarction.
