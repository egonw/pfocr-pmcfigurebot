caption: Pathway annotation and classification of metabolites in different databases
  of KEGG, HMDB and LIPID MAPS. (A) Metabolites annotated in the KEGG database in
  positive ion mode; (B) Metabolites in the KEGG database in negative ion mode; (C)
  Metabolites annotated in the HMDB database in positive ion mode; (D) Metabolites
  annotated in the HMDB database in negative ion mode; (E) Metabolites annotated in
  the LIPID MAPS database in positive ion mode; (F) Metabolites annotated in the LIPID
  MAPS database in positive ion mode. The bars in different color in (A,B) showed
  the category of metabolic pathways annotated in the KEGG database, and those in
  (E,F) showed the lipid category annotations in the LIPID MAPS database.
