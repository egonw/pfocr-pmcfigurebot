caption: 'Chemical structure of eluted fractions: (a) FA; (b) FB. Enhancement of cell
  viability and protection of Caco-2 cells from H2O2-induced oxidant damage by pre-treatment
  with PKLPs: (c) cell viability; (d) intracellular generation of ROS; (e) malondialdehyde
  (MDA) level of Caco2 cells. The reported values are represented as mean Â± SD (n
  = 3). Columns marked with different lowercase letters indicate the significant differences
  among treatments by using Duncan analysis.'
