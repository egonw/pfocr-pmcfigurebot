caption: 'HK2 altered the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells.
  (A) The TOP/FOP-Flash reporter assay was used to identify the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in HK2-modified ovarian cancer cells: (A) OVCA433-GFP and OVCA433-HK2;
  (D) SKOV3-GFP and SKOV3-HK2; (G) A2780-shCtr and A2780-shHK2. (B) The expression
  of β-catenin, c-myc and CyclinD1 was detected by western blotting in OVCA433-GFP
  and OVCA433-HK2 cells and the quantitative analysis is shown in (C). (E) The expression
  of β-catenin, c-myc and CyclinD1 was detected by western blotting in SKOV3-GFP and
  SKOV3-HK2 cells and the quantitative analysis is shown in (F). (H) The expression
  of β-catenin, c-myc and CyclinD1 was detected by western blotting in A2780-shCtr
  and A2780-shHK2 cells and the quantitative analysis is shown in (I). (J) The expression
  of HK2, β-catenin, c-myc and CyclinD1 was detected by immunohistochemical in the
  xenograft tumors that derived from HK2 over-expressed OVCA433 and SKOV3 cells, original
  magnification, 1000×. Values are shown as the mean±SD. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, vs.
  control using One-Way ANOVA.'
