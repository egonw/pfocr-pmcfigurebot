caption: 'FLOT1 expression was repressed by miR-1271-5p upregulation in CC cells.
  (a, b, c, d) The expressions of miR-1271-5p (a, b) and FLOT1 (c, d) in CC (SiHa
  and ME180) cells following transfection with FLOT1 overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p
  mimic alone or in combination were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (e, f) The expression of
  FLOT1 in CC (SiHa and ME180) cells after transfection with FLOT1 overexpression
  plasmids or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination was analyzed by western blot,
  with GAPDH as the reference gene. +P or ^P < 0.05; ^^P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P or ###P
  < 0.001; + vs. FLOT1+MC; ^ vs. NC+MC; # vs. FLOT1+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical cancer;
  qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; NC: negative
  control; M: miR-1271-5p mimic; MC: mimic control; WT: wild type; MUT: mutant type;
  FLOT1: flotillin 1.'
