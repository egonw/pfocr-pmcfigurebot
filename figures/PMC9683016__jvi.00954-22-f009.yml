caption: Inhibition of the NF-κB signaling or NLRP3 inflammasome activation promotes
  ASFV-ΔH240R replication in PAMs. (A and B) Inhibition of the NF-κB signaling promotes
  ASFV-ΔH240R replication in PAMs. PAMs (105) seeded in 48-well plates were cultured
  for 12 h, treated with 5 nM BAY11-7082 (an inhibitor of the NK-κB signaling pathway)
  in RPMI 1640 medium for another 2 h, and then infected with 105 genome copies of
  ASFV-ΔH240R or ASFV-WT. At 1.5 hpi, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. At
  72 hpi, the viral genome copies (A) and viral titers (B) in PAMs infected with ASFV-ΔH240R
  or ASFV-WT were determined. (C and D) Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  promotes ASFV-ΔH240R replication in PAMs. PAMs (105) were transfected with siNLRP3-1
  for 24 h, followed by infection with 105 genome copies of ASFV-ΔH240R or ASFV-WT
  for 72 h, and the viral genome copies (C) and viral titers (D) in the PAMs were
  quantitated. Data represent three independent experiments. The error bars denote
  standard errors of the means. The significance of the difference between the groups
  (n = 3) was measured using Student’s t test (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ns, not
  significant).
