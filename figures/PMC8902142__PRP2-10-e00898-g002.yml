caption: 'Capecitabine uptake and metabolism in orthotopic BxPC3 tumors. Autoradiographs
  from a representative cryosection section: (A) 3H and (B) 18F‐FAC. As the section
  contained minimal necrosis, the matched Hematoxylin & Eosin image is omitted. Scale
  bar = 1 mm. (C) The metabolic fate of capecitabine in 4 independent BxPC3 tumors.
  The pre‐active species are represented in shades of blue, ordered as in the metabolic
  pathway: capecitabine (CAP), 5’‐deoxy‐5‐fluorocytidine (5’DFCR), 5’‐deoxy‐5‐fluorouridine
  (5’DFUR), 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU). The inactive metabolites are represented in shades
  of gold, also as ordered as in the metabolic pathway: 5,6 dihydrofluorouracil (5‐FUH2),
  α‐fluoro‐β‐ureidopropionic acid (FUPA), β‐fluoroalanine (FBAL). Values are the average
  of three replicates; 40% of injected drug is in the form of pre‐active species,
  ± 7.4% (SD)'
article_title: Analysis of capecitabine metabolites in conjunction with digital autoradiography
  in a murine model of pancreatic cancer suggests extensive drug penetration through
  the tumor.
