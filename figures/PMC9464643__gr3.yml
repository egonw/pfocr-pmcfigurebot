caption: Example of graph exploration with respective Cypher (Neo4j query language)
  commands. The figure shows an example of a subset of a KG, each with 3 nodes and
  2 edges. The grey lines are links that could be inferred from the existing data,
  via exploration of the dashed lines. A) Gene (products) possibly belonging to a
  specific pathway are inferred, through one step neighbours of known gene (products)
  belonging to this specific pathway. B) A possible drug to treat a certain phenotype
  via the knowledge of a gene (product) causing this phenotype as well as a drug -
  gene (product) relationship is sought. Below the figure, examples of cypher (Neo4j
  query language) queries are shown, which show how the graph can be explored and
  missing links can be inferred, in a very simplistic manner. If the graph would contain
  multiple genes or drugs that would fit the criteria outlined in the queriers, multiple
  results would be returned.
