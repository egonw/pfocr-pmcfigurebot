caption: Gene modulation associated with significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathways in the different BW groups on d 36. (A) Gene modulation
  was determined based on gene expression values in the “cell replication pathway”
  enriched specifically in the D36B (bottom 10%) group. (B) Gene modulation in the
  “alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism” enriched in D36A (average). (C, D)
  Gene modulation in the “fatty acid biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis pathway”
  enriched in D36T (top 10%).
