figure_title: Functional enrichment of gene transcripts significantly associated with
  delayed brain development and accelerated brain aging
caption: a, 990 genes were spatially correlated with the first PLS component of delayed
  structural brain development, and were enriched for trans-synaptic signal regulation,
  forebrain development, signal release and cAMP signaling pathway. b, 2,293 genes
  were spatially correlated the first PLS component of accelerated structural brain
  aging, and were enriched for macroautophagy, pathways of neurodegeneration, establishment
  of protein localization to organelle and histone modification. Size of the circle
  represents number of genes in each term and P values were corrected using FDR for
  multiple comparisons.
