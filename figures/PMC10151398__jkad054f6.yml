caption: Summary expression of signaling pathway ligands and receptors. The expression
  profile for the ligand(s) and receptor(s) in 10 different signaling pathways in
  the two cell types are shown, along with the previously reported microarray expression
  profile (). Color coding indicates expression was detected (green), not detected
  (blue), or, in the case where multiple ligands or receptors exist, expression of
  a single ligand or receptor was detected (yellow).
