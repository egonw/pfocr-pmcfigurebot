caption: 'The inhibitory effect of puerarin on OC was associated with differences
  in the gut microbiota communities among the OC model rats. (a) Linear discriminant
  analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis was performed to identify the key gut microbes.
  There were 49 markedly changed gut microbes with linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
  score > 3 and p < 0.05 among the four groups. (b) Cladogram of the identified gut
  microbes. (c) Expression of the significant gut microbes at the genus level in the
  four tested groups. (d) Correlation heatmap of the gut microbiota. (e) Metabolic
  pathway analysis of the gut microbes. OC: ovarian cancer.'
