caption: NAA10 knockdown promotes OSCC cell migration and invasion, and tumorigenesis
  in vivo. (A) Stable knockdown of NAA10 was examined by Western blot in CAL 27 and
  SCC‐15 cells, and proliferation in CAL 27 and SCC‐15 cells after Silencing of NAA10
  was assessed by colony forming assay. Colonies were stained with crystal violet
  10 days after seeding. (B and C) Transwell assay were performed to evaluate the
  effect of NAA10 silencing on migration (B) and invasion (C) of CAL 27 and SCC‐15
  cells. Collective results from three independent experiments (triplicate wells for
  each) were summarized in the graphs. The fold difference represents the mean of
  triplicate experiments compared with control cells. (D–F) Macrograph, volume and
  weight of tumours in both two groups. Eight mice were analysed in each group. (G)
  Percentage survival of nude mice inoculated with indicated cancer cells. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, as determined by Student's t‐test
