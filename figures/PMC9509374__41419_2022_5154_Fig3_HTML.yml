figure_title: Knockdown of HM13 triggers autophagy by inducing ER-stress in breast
  cancer
caption: A SUM1315 (left) and ZR-75-1 (right) cell lines were transfected with siRNAs
  (si-HM13-1 and si-HM13-2) or negative control (si-NC) and relative mRNA expression
  of ER stress-relating genes was analyzed by qRT–PCR. B Western blot was performed
  to detect the protein levels of PERK and CHOP in breast cancer cell lines in HM13
  knockdown groups and control group. C, D SUM1315 (C) and ZR-75-1 (D) were stably
  transfected with mCherry-EGFP-LC3B lentivirus and then treated with siRNAs or si-NC,
  respectively. The subcellular localization of autophagosomes and autolysosomes were
  illustrated by fluorescent confocal microscopy and the bars graphs showed the specific
  quantities of the fluorescent puncta data. The yellow puncta indicated autophagosomes,
  and the red puncta indicated autolysosomes (the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes)
  in the merged figures. The data were presented as the mean ± SD of three experiments.
  Scale bars, 10 µm. E Representative transmission electron micrographs demonstrated
  the ultrastructure of breast cancer cells. Double membrane autophagosomes were counted
  in randomly selected >100 cells. Arrow indicates the autophagosomes distributing
  in the cytoplasm. Scale bars, 2 µm and 200 nm. F The protein expressions of LC3B-II,
  LC3B-I, and p62 in SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 respectively transfected with siRNAs or negative
  control were determined by western blot. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
