caption: The exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ exerted tumor inhibition effects on glioma
  in vivo. (a) Brain MRI was performed on the treated mice after four-week treatment
  to measure the volume of the transplanted tumor. The results showed that the exosomes
  loaded with si-PDGFRβ significantly inhibited the growth of gliomas. (b) In vivo
  bioluminescence, imaging showed that exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ had relatively
  high targeting ability. (c) H&E staining indicated that the si-PDGFRβ-Exo-treated
  group induced more necrotic cells than the PBS and Unload-Exo groups. TUNEL assay
  indicated that si-PDGFRβ-Exo induced apoptosis. (d) Immunoblot detection demonstrated
  that si-PDGFRβ-Exo significantly decreased p-PI3K, p-AKT, EZH2, and PDL1 proteins
  (∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PBS or Unloaded-Exo group).
