caption: Mechanistic insight illustration of revealed potential signaling pathway;
  Comparison of ADAM8-Ctrl cells (left side) with ADAM8-KD cells (right side) and
  the ADAM8-specific effects related to the interaction of the cells with their extracellular
  environment. Cell-matrix interplay by integrins is influencing adhesion of cells
  within a collagen matrix. In the presence of fibronectin (small green squiggles
  in the right-hand picture of the middle row) the stiffness of the matrices increases
  with direct impact to the adhesion of the cells, due to integrin signaling. In case
  of ADAM8-Ctrl cells ADAM8 is upregulated due to the specific ADAM8-fibronectin interaction.
  This leads to an increased direct (ADAM8-specific) matrix-degradation and indirect
  degradation via MMP9 upregulation by ADAM8. ADAM8-KD that do not have ADAM8 available
  possess only the direct MMP-regulated degradation of the matrix. Therefore, they
  channel their interactions towards increased interplay with the altered matrix by
  fibronectin presence by increasing the deformation of the matrix by means of fiber
  displacements.
