caption: MTHFD2 expression in various cancers notably in BC (A) Differential expression
  of MTHFD2 in various types of cancer analysed by TIMER. (B) Differential expression
  of MTHFD2 in BC tissue samples and normal bladder tissue samples. (C) Differential
  expression of MTHFD2 in BC tissue samples and their paired normal bladder tissue
  samples. (D) ROC curve analysis of MTHFD2. (E) WB analysis of MTHFD2 expression
  in SV‐HUC‐1 and bladder cancer cell lines. (F) RT‐qPCR analysis of MTHFD2 expression
  in SV‐HUC‐1 and bladder cancer cell lines. (G) Representative images of immunohistochemistry
  for the tumour and adjacent normal tissues of eight BC patients. MTHFD2 was used
  for staining. (Scale bar represents 100 μm) (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
article_title: MTHFD2 promotes PD‐L1 expression via activation of the JAK/STAT signalling
  pathway in bladder cancer.
