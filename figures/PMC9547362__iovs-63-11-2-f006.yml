caption: METTL3 silencing reduced inflammation and fungal burden in fungal keratitis.
  (A) Representative photographs of mouse corneas at 5 days after fungal infection.
  (B) Pathological alterations in the corneas of mice observed via H&E staining. The
  scale bar indicates 50 µm. (C) Clinical scores showing the inflammation in corneas
  among the F. solani, the AAV-siNC, and the AAV-siMETTL3 groups. (D) Comparison of
  the m6A content in total RNAs among the F. solani, the AAV-siNC, and the AAV-siMETTL3
  groups. (E) Fungal burden was quantified by counting the colony forming units. (F,
  G) The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were evaluated via RT–PCR and ELISAs; n
  = 6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
