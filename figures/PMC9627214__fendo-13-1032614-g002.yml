caption: 'Necroptosis: a regulatory cell death. The death receptor signaling pathway
  is responsible for necroptosis This image depicts the interaction between tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor 1(TNFR1). When the binding of tumor necrosis
  factor-α(TNFα) to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR1 ligation triggers the assembly of
  complex I composed of TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF2/5, cIAP1/2 and LUBAC. Cell survival, apoptosis,
  and necroptosis are all possible consequences of complex I formation, which are
  regulated by different downstream cytosolic signaling complexes. Cell survival is
  boosted by ubiquitination of RIPK1, which activates the NF-κB pathway and promotes
  cell proliferation. Under a certain circumstance, deubiquitination of RIPK1 can
  result in the complex recruiting TRADD, FADD and caspase-8 forming complex IIa which
  activates apoptosis, or recruiting FADD, RIPK3, and caspase-8 forming complex IIb,
  which activates necroptosis. By blocking caspase-8, the binding of activated RIPK1
  and RIPK3 leads to RIPK3 activation, which then phosphorylates and activates a pseudokinase
  called MLKL. MLKL undergoes oligomerization and translocates to and permeabilizes
  the plasma membrane to induce necroptosis.'
