figure_title: miR-275 and miR-305 maternal loss-of-function mutants exhibited impaired
  flight capability, decreased hatching rate and survival rate
caption: (A) Negative flip duration of heterozygous mutants and wild-type flies. (B)
  Effect of miRNA mutation on the cumulative flight distance. The flight mill system
  was used to compute the flight performance of heterozygote mutant and wild-type
  females at 10 DPE. (C) Embryo hatchability of the heterozygous mutants and wild-type
  flies. Flies with depleted miR-275 and miR-305 showed only 55.48% and 50.28% mean
  hatching rates, whereas wild-type flies showed an 87.74% mean hatching rate. Each
  treatment contained 200 eggs and 8 biological replicates. (D) Survival curves of
  heterozygous mutant and wild-type adult female flies. The survival rate was monitored
  for 40 days after genotype identification. Survival curves indicated that the survival
  rate of miR-275+/- and miR-305+/- was significantly lower than wild-type flies (P
  = 0.0002 and P = 0.037, respectively, n = 60, Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test). The
  data are expressed as mean Â± SEM. ***, P < 0.001.
