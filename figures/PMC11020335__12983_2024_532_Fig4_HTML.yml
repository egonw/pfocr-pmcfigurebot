caption: The transcriptional patterns of gill apoptosis related genes. A-C bar plots
  showing the DEGs involving in thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) (A), BCL-2 related
  proteins (B), and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (C). Different
  letters denote significance between groups at a threshold of p value < 0.05 (one-way
  ANOVA and S-N-K post-hoc test). D Heat maps presenting the variation patterns of
  genes that are involved in matrix metalloproteinase (gene expression varied with
  developmental stages, p value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). E Schematic diagram of the
  pathway involved in gill resorption
