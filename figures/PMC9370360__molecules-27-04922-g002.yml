caption: 'RAGE regulates the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. After binding to the ligand,
  RAGE phosphorylates its downstream MAPK and activates NF-κB protein. NF-κB enters
  the nucleus to promote the transcriptional expression of inflammatory factors. Abbreviations:
  AGEs: advanced glycation end products; HMGB1: high-mobility group protein 1; RAGE:
  receptor for advanced glycation end products; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1β: interleukin-1β.'

  in Immune Diseases.'
