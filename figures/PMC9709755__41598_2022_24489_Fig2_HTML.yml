caption: Top disease phenotypes, canonical pathways and predicted upstream regulators
  of differentially expressed genes in Native Hawaiians when compared to Japanese.
  (a) Number of up- and downregulated genes in most enriched disease phenotypes. Green
  bars are downregulated genes, red bars are upregulated genes. (b) Bubble plot indicating
  the top canonical pathways, where bubble size corresponds to number of genes enriched
  for corresponding pathway and color indicates z score. Orange bubbles indicate predicted
  activation and a positive z score, blue bubbles indicate predicted inhibition and
  a negative z score. Grey bubbles indicate no z score or a z score of 0. (c) Network
  of genes affected by predicted upstream regulators Lh, LARP1, and RICTOR, and their
  associated canonical pathways (CP). (d) Network of genes affected by YAP1 and associated
  CPs.
