caption: Investigation of immune diversity between the high-and low-HARM groups. (a)
  The violin plots exhibited the StromalScore, ImmuneScore, and ESTIMATEScore differences
  between the high- and low-HARM groups. (b) The heatmap shows the immune pathway
  variation between HARM groups by GSVA. (c) The immunocyte infiltration diversity
  between the two HARM groups was calculated using seven different algorithms and
  visualized in a heatmap. (d) The TIDE score levels were compared between the high-HARM
  and the low-HARME groups in a violin plot. (e) The box plots compare immune checkpoint
  expression levels between the high-and the low-HARM groups. Ns means not statistically
  significant; ∗, ∗∗, and∗∗∗ represent the P value less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001,
  respectively.
