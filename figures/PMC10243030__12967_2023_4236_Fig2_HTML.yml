caption: NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 is required for breast cancer invasion and metastasis in
  vitro and in vivo. A The effect of NUCB2 on cell migration and invasion in breast
  cancer cell lines. Briefly, 4 × 104 stable cells were plated in triplicate in an
  upper chamber pre-coated without or with Matrigel. The lower chamber was filled
  with 500 μl culture medium, and cells were cultured for 24 h. The migrated or invaded
  cells were stained and photographed. B The effect of NUCB2 on the expression of
  EMT-related epithelial or mesothelial molecular markers detected by Western blot.
  Representative Western blot results and relative quantitative data are shown. C–E
  The effect of NUCB2 on pulmonary metastasis in the tail vein injection model. shNUCB2-MDA-MB-231
  and CTRL-MDA-MB-231stable cell lines labeled by fluorescence were injected into
  the nude mice via vein tail. At the end of the experiment, mice were taken photos
  (C) and dissected to assess tumor nodules (D, E). The non-paired T-test was used
  to verify the statistical significance, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
