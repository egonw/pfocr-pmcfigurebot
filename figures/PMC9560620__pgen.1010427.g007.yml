figure_title: Regulatory gene-network controlling CA and PG specification
caption: The regulation of the sna-rg enhancer in wild type embryos uncovers upstream
  factors mediating CA and PG specification. upd transcription is repressed directly
  or indirectly by both Ci and Arm-dTCF. Hh signalling from the posterior compartment
  releases the Ci repressive activity over upd transcription. Dfd and Scr proteins
  prevent the gland primordia from entering into apoptosis and also up-regulate Upd
  expression. Activated STAT induces sna transcription by direct binding to the sna-rg
  enhancer. Besides the Hox proteins, an additional factor (question mark) also contributes
  to upd expression in the maxilla and labium. This additional factor could be the
  activated form of the Ci protein or another factor still to be defined.
