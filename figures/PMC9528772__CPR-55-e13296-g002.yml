caption: Sirt6 overexpression in podocytes protects mitochondria under Ang II stimulation
  conditions. (A and B) Assessment of transfection efficiency after pcDNA3.1 or Sirt6‐WT
  transfection. (C) Mitochondrial morphology assessed by MitoTracker Red staining
  of podocytes stimulated with Ang II for 24 h. Scale bar = 3 μm. (D and E) Average
  length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria in each group. (F and G) The mitochondrial
  potential of podocytes under different conditions was measured via JC‐1 staining.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. (H) Comparison of ATP production levels in different groups.
  (I) Fluorescence intensity of MitoSOX Red staining of the cells in different groups.
  (J and K) Analysis of cell apoptosis among different groups. *p < 0.05, n = 5
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
