caption: 'Timeline of the adriamycin‐induced nephropathy model. Male SD rats were
  given 4 mg/kg adriamycin or saline via the tail vein on day 1 and 3.5 mg/kg on day
  8. PA, EPI, or distilled water were administered from day 15, and samples were collected
  after 4 consecutive weeks. NS: normal saline; i.v: tail vein injection; i.g: intragastric
  administration. EPI, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim; PA, prednisone acetate; SD, Sprague
  Dawley.'

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
