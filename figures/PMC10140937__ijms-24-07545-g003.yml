caption: Functional pathway enrichment analysis displaying gene ontology (GO) biological
  process term networks. (A) The largest network associated with immune response,
  interferon signalling, and coagulation found in differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  identified in brain tissue from mtDNA-supplemented and control pigs; (B) the largest
  network associated with fatty acid, acyl-CoA, monosaccharide metabolic processes
  (top) and mitochondrial protein transport related network (bottom) identified from
  heart DEGs between mtDNA-supplemented and control tissues; and (C) the largest network
  associated with morphogenesis and development for tissues and organs found in liver
  DEGs between mtDNA-supplemented and control tissues. GO terms with related function
  were grouped by Cytoscape auto-annotation function, and group annotation titles
  were given automatically or manually. Each circle represents an individual GO term,
  and the colour and size of a circle indicate the level of significance by pathway
  enrichment analysis and the number of genes associated with the GO term, respectively.
