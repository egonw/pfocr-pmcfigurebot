caption: circ_0006427 was down-regulated in NSCLC. A. circ_0006427 expression in NSCLC
  tissues and paracancerous tissues was examined by qRT-PCR. B. circ_0006427 expression
  in NSCLC cells and BEAS-2B cells was detected by qRT-PCR. C. Subcellular fractionation
  assay was used to measure the expression levels of circ_0006427, U6 and Î²-ACTIN
  in the nuclear and cytoplasm of A549 and H292 cells. All experiments were repeated
  thrice with triplicate samples in each experiment. *; P<0.05, NSCLC; Non-small cell
  lung cancer, and qRT-PCR; Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
