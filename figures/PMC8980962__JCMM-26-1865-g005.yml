caption: Canonical JAK‐STAT pathway. Schematic representation of the signalling cascade
  induced by cytokines that signal through the JAK‐STAT pathway. Once a cytokine binds
  to a specific receptor, it induces JAK transactivation. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate
  tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor. These phosphotyrosines
  in turn serve as docking site for STAT recruitment, through their SH2 domain. Subsequently,
  JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residue of STAT factors, resulting in STAT activation.
  The activated STATs form homo‐ and hetero‐dimers that migrate into the nucleus and
  regulate the transcription of specific genes
