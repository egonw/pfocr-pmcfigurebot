caption: Pathways analysis of differentially expressed lipid species in piglet jejunal
  crypt cells between post-weaning days 3 and 14 (weaned at 21 d of age). (A) Summary
  of the metabolic pathways involved in lipid species with significantly different
  levels (P < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection >1). Color gradient represents
  the significance of the pathway ranked by P-value (yellow, higher P-value; red,
  lower P-value). Circle size indicates the pathway impact score (a larger circle
  represents a higher impact score). Pathways with impact scores higher than 0.10
  are identified by name. Labels within small boxes correspond to KEGG identifiers
  for metabolites. (B) Pathway of glycerophospholipid metabolism. Phosphatidylcholine
  (C00157) and phosphatidylethanolamine (C00350) are hit and colored in red in the
  boxes.
