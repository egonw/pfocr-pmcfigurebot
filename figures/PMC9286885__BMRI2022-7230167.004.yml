caption: 'Effect of miR-138 on the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in hDPSCs under TNF-α
  treatment. (a, b) Protein expression of FAK, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and RUNX2 in hDPSCs
  cultured in osteogenic medium with or without TNF-α (50 ng/mL) for 3, 5, 7, and
  14 days. ∗P < 0.05, TNF-α group vs. blank group (same day). (c, d) Protein expression
  of FAK, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and RUNX2 in the blank group (cultured in osteogenic medium),
  TNF-α group (cultured in osteogenic medium with 50 ng/mL TNF-α), miR-NC + TNF-α
  group (pretransfected with miR-NC for 24 h and cultured in osteogenic medium with
  50 ng/mL TNF-α), miR-138 + TNF-α group (pretransfected with miR-138 for 24 h and
  cultured in osteogenic medium with 50 ng/mL TNF-α), and miR-138 inhibitor + TNF-α
  group (pretransfected with miR-138 inhibitor for 24 h and cultured in osteogenic
  medium with 50 ng/mL TNF-α) for 7 days. (a, c) Representative images of Western
  blotting. (b, d) Bar graph demonstrating the relative protein levels. The bar graphs
  are means from three independent experiments. The error bars are standard deviations.
  ∗P < 0.05, when compared to the blank group; #P < 0.05, when compared to the miR-NC + TNF-α
  group.'
