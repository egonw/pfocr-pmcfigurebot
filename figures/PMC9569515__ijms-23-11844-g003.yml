caption: Reactome pathway map analysis of proteomic data following broiler dietary
  GHP supplementation over 35-day period. This data reveals consistent elevation of
  immune-function associated proteins indicative of an activated innate immune response
  associated with improved capacity to ameliorate infection. (A) Pathway map of 19
  proteins involved in the immune system that were significantly increased in abundance
  or uniquely present in the serum of GHP1 supplemented broiler chickens. (B) Reactome
  pathway map of 19 proteins involved in the immune system that were significantly
  increased in abundance in the serum of GHP2 supplemented broiler chickens. Highlighted
  lines and dots represent proteomic pathways within the immune system that contain
  proteins which have been increased in abundance with GHP2 supplementation. (C) Pathway
  map of 19 proteins involved in the immune system that were significantly increased
  in abundance or uniquely present in the serum of GHP3 supplemented broiler chickens.
  All data obtained using Reactome.org [].
