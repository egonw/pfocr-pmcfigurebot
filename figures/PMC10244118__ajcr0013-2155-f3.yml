caption: Effects of Ly6D on chemoresistance-related genes in LSCC cells. (A) Volcano
  plot displayed the genes significantly up-regulated in Tu686 cells stably expressing
  Ly6D from qPCR array analysis. The fold changes > 2-fold change (log2) and P < 0.05
  (-log10) were the selected genes and labeled with light red color. (B, C) The indicated
  mRNA expressions was analyzed by qPCR in CAL27 cells stably expressing Ly6D (B)
  or Ly6D-targeting shRNA (C). (D) The mRNA levels of ABCB1, ABCC1, MYC, CCND1, and
  BCL2 was determined by qPCR analysis in LSCC cells expressing shcont or shLy6D-2.
  (E) Relative expression of the indicated proteins was detected by western blot in
  stable Ly6D knockdown cells. (F) Levels of indicated proteins were detected by western
  blot in LSCC cells with stably overexpressing Ly6D.
