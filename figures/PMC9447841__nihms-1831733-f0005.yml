caption: Induction of autophagy by SFN through the AMPK pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
  Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μM SFN at the indicated time (0,
  0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h). (A, B) The expression of phosphorylated AMPKα (p-AMPKα),
  total AMPKα (AMPKα), phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), total mTOR (mTOR), phosphorylated
  ULK1 (p-ULK1), total ULK1 (ULK1), phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1), total 4E-BP1
  (4E-BP1), (C, D) phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), total ERK1/2 (ERK1/2), Rubicon
  protein, and nuclear Nrf2 protein were determined by western blotting with specific
  antibodies. β-actin or Histone H3 was used as an internal control. Values are the
  mean±S.E.M. (n=3). *P<.05 versus 0 h (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman post hoc
  test). (E, F) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μM SFN for DMSO (control)
  24 h after transfection with 100 pmol AMPKα1/2 siRNA (siAMPKα) or negative control
  (siCont.) for 24 h. (E) The expression of p-AMPKα and AMPKα protein was determined
  by western blotting with specific antibodies. (F) The culture medium was collected
  and assayed for NEFA content (mEq/L/mg protein). Values are the mean±S.E.M. (n=4).
  *P<.05 (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman post hoc test). (G) Schematic illustration
  of the induction of lipophagy by SFN in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
