caption: Identification and characterization of phosphoproteins in the brain tissues
  of septic mice treated with H2. (A) Experimental workflow to analyse the proteome
  and phosphoproteome of brain tissues derived from CLP and CLP + H2 mice. (B) Volcano
  plots showing the distribution of the significance and fold change of identified
  proteins and phosphopeptides between CLP + H2 mice and CLP mice. All data points
  are plotted in log2 (fold change) on the x‐axis and −log10 (p‐value) on the y‐axis.
  Blue dashed lines indicate a cutoff of fold change >1.2 or <0.05, one‐sample t‐test).
  (C) The proportion of Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation sites in identified phosphopeptides.
  (D) Histogram depicting the distribution of the number of phosphorylation sites
  per protein. (E) Frequency distribution of phosphorylation modification sites
