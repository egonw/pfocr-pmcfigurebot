caption: Proposed model of the roles of p53 and STAT3 following RIPK1 knockdown in
  liver cancer cells. A. In the absence of exogenous stimulation, RIPK1 promotes the
  growth of liver cancer cells through the STAT3/ATR survival pathway or NF-ÎºB signaling
  (not shown). Since p53 is maintained at low levels by ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal
  degradation, it is not activated under unstressed conditions []. B. During RIPK1
  silencing, p53 expression is increased and the STAT3/ATR-mediated DNA damage repair
  response is inhibited, resulting in the apoptosis of liver cancer cells with wild
  type p53. C. RIPK1 knockdown in liver cancer cells with mutant inactivated p53 decreases
  STAT3-mediated survival pathways but is moderately restored by the loss of the STAT3-repressive
  ability of mutant p53. Arrows indicate activating interactions and lines terminating
  in a circle indicate repressive interactions.
