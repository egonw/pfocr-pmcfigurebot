caption: 'FtcR binds to the promoter region of ftcR in vivo and in vitro: (A) FtcR-enriched
  sequence reads located within the promoter regions of ftcR, with annotated genes
  shown at the bottom—ChIP1 and ChIP2—from two independent experimental replicates.
  Scale bar: 1 kb. (B) Conserved motifs identified by FtcR ChIP-Seq. (C) EMSA for
  FtcR binding to the TGTGGGCA motif in the ftcR promoter fragments, labeled by biotin.
  (D) Specificity and competition assays. The TGTGGGCA motif was mutated into TGTCCTTG
  to test for sequence specificity. The unlabeled cold ftcR promoter region was tested
  for competition with the biotin-labeled ftcR promoter. The unlabeled cold ftcR promoter
  region inhibited the binding of FtcR to the labeled promoter. The symbols “−“ and
  “+” indicate the absence and presence, respectively, of the corresponding proteins
  or probes. Unrelated probes were used as negative controls. Results are representative
  of at least three independent experiments. (E) The effect of FtcR on the expression
  of the cognate promoter was detected by β-galactosidase assays using an ftcR promoter–lacZ
  transcriptional fusion reporter plasmid. Data represent the mean and standard deviation
  of n = 3 (independent biological replicates). The asterisks indicate significant
  differences (** p < 0.01) based on one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test
  of honestly significant differences (two-tailed).'
