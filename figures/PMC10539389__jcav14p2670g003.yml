caption: Overexpression of FANCE mediated increased drug resistance by upregulating
  FA pathway (A) WB analysis showed OE-FANCE induced increased expression of FANCD2,
  RAD51, and decreased expression of γH2AX in EC cells. FANCE-KD induced the opposite
  expression. GAPDH was used as the housekeeping protein. (B) EC cells were incubated
  with cisplatin or MMC at a range of concentrations for 48 h, and cell viability
  was measured by CCK8 assays. GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to calculate the IC50 of
  the drug. The cisplatin IC50s of HEC-1-A OE-FANCE and HEC-1-A NC cells were 19.477μM
  and 5.792μM respectively. The MMC IC50s of HEC-1-A OE-FANCE and HEC-1-A NC cells
  were 1.334μM and 0.095μM. (C) The cisplatin IC50s of HEC-1-B FANCE-KD and HEC-1-B
  NC cells were 6.21μM and 14.564μM. The MMC IC50s of HEC-1-B FANCE-KD and HEC-1-B
  NC cells were 0.562μM and 1.799μM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
