figure_title: Mucosal repair is defective in ZO-1KO.IEC mice
caption: A. ZO-1KO.IEC (red squares) and WT (blue squares) mice were treated with
  1% DSS for six days and then returned to normal water. Weight curves are shown.
  n = 4–5 per group. B. EdU (green) was administered 2hr before sacrifice. Treatment
  with 1% DSS markedly increased numbers of proliferating cells in WT, but not ZO-1KO.IEC,
  mice. n =4–5 per group. C, D. Weight curves of ZO-1KO.IEC and WT mice treated with
  2% or 3% DSS for six days and allowed to recover. n = 6–7 per group. E. Colonic
  shortening after 2% DSS treatment is significantly greater in ZO-1KO.IEC relative
  to WT mice. Representative pseudocolor images of methylene blue-stained colons at
  low and high magnification show that crypts are completely lost in ZO-1KO.IEC but
  partially preserved in WT. n = 5–6 per group. F. Representative images and histopathology
  scores of ZO-1KO.IEC and WT mice without DSS exposure after (H2O) or after 6 days
  of 2% DSS treatment and one day of recovery (DSS). n = 4 per group. G. Permeability
  of both 4 kDa dextran and 70 kDa dextran is dramatically increased in 2% DSS-treated
  ZO-1KO.IEC relative to WT mice. This indicates greater mucosal damage, i.e., unrestricted
  pathway permeability, rather than tight junction leak pathway permeability increases.
  n =6–8 per group. H, I. EdU and MKI67 (green) stains shows similar numbers of proliferating
  cells in ZO-1KO.IEC and WT mice at baseline. However, only WT mice are able to significantly
  increase proliferation in response to 2% DSS. ZO-1 (white) and nuclei (blue) are
  shown for orientation. n =4–6 per group. J. qRT-PCR of mucosal transcripts before,
  after 6 days of 2% DSS treatment, wand during recovery shows both increased and
  prolonged cytokine elevation in ZO-1KO.IEC, relative to WT, mice. n =5 per group.
  K, L. Infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages (green) is markedly greater
  in 2% DSS-treated ZO-1KO.IEC, relative to WT, mice. E-cadherin (Ecad, white) and
  nuclei (blue) are shown for orientation. n =4 per group. Bars = 20 μm, 10 μm (high
  magnification), and 50 μm (pseudocolor gross image). Student’s t test (A-G) and
  ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction (H-L). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.
