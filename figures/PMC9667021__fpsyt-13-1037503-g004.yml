caption: The performance of each machine learning model. The relation between the
  number of neighbors (k value) and accuracy in KNN (A). The degree and coefficient
  of SVM are shown in panel (B). In RF, the interrelation between the number of trees
  and model error is shown in panel (C). After 43,703 steps, the error was 0.009257
  in the ANN model (D). KNN, k-nearest neighbor; SVM, support vector machine; RF,
  random forest; ANN, artificial neural network.
