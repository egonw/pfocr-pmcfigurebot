caption: The levels of CCL2, CCL7 and NF‐κB pathway members were increased in BMMs
  from women with PMOP. (A–D) Differences in height (A) and BMI (B) were not significant
  between premenopausal adult women without osteoporosis (n = 5) and postmenopausal
  women with PMOP (n = 5) (t = 0.63 and 1.08, P = 0.55 and 0.31), but differences
  in age (C) and T score (D) were significant (t = 8.37, 9.88, both P < 0.001). (E)
  Heatmap of RNA‐seq data showing that the levels of CCL2, CCL7 and their receptor
  CCR2 were higher in women with PMOP than in premenopausal women without osteoporosis.
  (F) A principal component analysis (PCA) plot was generated by using the expression
  information of each sample. A shorter distance between samples indicates more similar
  expression. (G) Scatter plot of the KEGG pathway enrichment results for the DEGs
  showing that the NF‐κB signaling pathway was markedly upregulated. Independent t
  test; ns, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001.
