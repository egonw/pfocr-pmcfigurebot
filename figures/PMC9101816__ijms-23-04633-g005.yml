caption: Expected regulatory pathway of androgen synthesis genes by MSC-derived proteins.
  The protein interaction network for CYP17A1, DENND1A and CYP11A1, according to the
  database test mining algorithm (STRING). (a) Predicted regulation of CYP17A1 through
  the MAPK (MEK) pathway by MSC secreted proteins. (b) Predicted regulation of DENND1A
  expression in the 20 most promising direct protein interactions with MSC-secreted
  proteins. (c) Predicted regulation of CYP11A1 expression through the 20 most promising
  direct protein interactions with MSC-secreted proteins.
