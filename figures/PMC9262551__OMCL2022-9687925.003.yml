caption: 'Therapeutic targeting of NLRP3 inflammasome in DW. Activation of Nrf2-mediated
  antioxidant defenses and suppression of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated anti-inflammatory
  action are effective therapeutic strategies, which also include GC-AgNPs-CGP, plumbagin,
  neferine, rutin, and luteolin. Metformin and rapamycin target AMPK and mTOR to inhibit
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, consequently blocking the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Glyburide suppresses NLRP3 oligomerization in an ATPase-dependent manner. P2X7 is
  a vital target of BBG, Zol, and MFG-E8. In addition, inhibition of TXNIP by fenofibrate
  can regulate the ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome to exert a beneficial effect on
  DW. NAC and SKQ1 inhibit ROS and mROS, respectively, to block the assembly of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. YVAD is a specific inhibitor of caspase-1. Additionally, BAY
  11-7082, BSP, and melatonin directly black the oligomerization of NLRP3 to exert
  beneficial effect for DW healing. Abbreviation: DW: diabetic wound; NLRP3: Nod-like
  receptor protein; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TXNIP: thioredoxin-interacting protein;
  Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor; GC-AgNPs-CGP: gallocatechin-silver
  nanoparticle-impregnated cotton gauze patches; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase;
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; BBG: brilliant blue G; Zol: zoledronate; MFG-E8:
  milk fat globule epidermal growth factor VIII; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; mROS: mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species; BSP: Bletilla striata polysaccharide; SKQ1: 10-(6′-plastoquinonyl)
  decyltriphenylphosphonium; YVAD: Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp.'
