caption: 'Landscape of genomic alterations in young rectal cancer patients and their
  impact on overall survival. (A) Oncoprint showing germline variants detected in
  young rectal cancer patients. Clinical data and the status of mismatch repair protein
  expression in tumor samples are highlighted. Genes are grouped according to their
  function (repair‐associated gene, tumor suppressor, oncogene, others). The top panel
  demonstrates the number of altered genes per sample. (B‐D) Overall survival of early‐onset
  rectal cancer patients according to the presence of any variants (B), variants identified
  in any repair gene (C), or specifically in genes involved in the HR repair pathway
  (D). Abbreviations: MMR: mismatch repair; Meta diag.: metastasis at diagnosis; Meta/Rec
  f.up: metastasis or recurrence during follow‐up; AMI/II or NCCN: Amsterdam I/II
  or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (version 1.2020) criteria for Lynch Syndrome;
  HR: homologous recombination; NHEJ: non‐homologous end joining; FA: Fanconi anemia;
  BER: base excision repair; NER: nucleotide excision repair; TSG: tumor suppressor
  gene'
