caption: Establishment of scaffold flavanone (2S)-naringenin biosynthesis. (a) Biosynthetic
  pathway of (2S)-naringenin in E. coli. (b) Cultivation of the engineered strain
  HE00 with different p-coumaric acid concentrations (0 to 2.0 g L–1) in LB, TB, and
  SB media. The lines indicate biomass at OD600. (c) Cultivation of the engineered
  strain HE01 with different l-tyrosine concentrations (0–2.0 g L–1) in TB medium.
