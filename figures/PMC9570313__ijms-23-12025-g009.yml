caption: Pathway Mapping and Enrichment that Resulted from Differentially Accumulated
  Metabolites (DAMs) Analyzed in KEGG. (A) The top 20 metabolisms that resulted from
  99 DAMs were enriched via KEGG analysis to show the differentiation between the
  treated (C-Y) and control (CK-Y) leaves. (B) The top 20 metabolisms that resulted
  from 88 DAMs were enriched via a KEGG analysis to show the differentiation between
  the treated (C-J) and control (CK-J) stems. The ordinate shows the metabolisms.
  The abscissa shows the enrichment factor, which is the number of differential metabolites
  divided by all the numbers in the pathway. The bubble sizes indicate the number
  of metabolites. The trend of colors from blue to read indicates the Q values. KEGG,
