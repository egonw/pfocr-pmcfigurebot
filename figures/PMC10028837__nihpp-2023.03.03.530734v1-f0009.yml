figure_title: Suggested model for VraFG-dependent high-level β-lactam resistance in
  the MRSA pgl mutant
caption: A. Illustration of JE2 and pgl cell division during growth in CDMG OX. pgl
  cells are smaller than wild-type JE2 when grown in CDMG and undergo normal cell
  division, whereas extensive lysis is evident among wild type cells. B. Illustration
  of peptidoglycan (PG), wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) biosynthesis
  in a pgl mutant. Mutations in vraF, vraG and to a lesser extent graR reverse the
  increased OX resistance phenotype of the pgl mutant. Metabolic reprogramming in
  the pgl mutant increases carbon flux to cell envelope precursors and β-lactam resistance
  via a mechanism dependent on VraFG/GraRS-controlled regulation of WTA/LTA biosynthesis,
  export or posttranslational modification. Previous studies have implicated the VraFG/GraRS
  complex in resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and regulation of dltABCD
  and mprF transcription, and it has also been proposed to play a role in the export
  of peptidoglycan or teichoic acid precursors or modifying subunits.
