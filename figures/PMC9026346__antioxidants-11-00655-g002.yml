caption: Gene expression at 10 and 60 min after exposure of E. coli BW25113 to 2.5
  mM H2O2. Volcano plots representing the dysregulated genes at 10 (A) and 60 min
  (B) after H2O2 addition compared to respective untreated cells. Blue dots represent
  significantly up-regulated genes and red dots represent significantly down-regulated
  genes; thresholds were set as p-value = 0.01 and fold-change ≥ 5; (C) Multi-Dimensional
  Scaling plot of all samples, each color represent a condition, each dot a sample.
  Distances between dots represent the coefficient of variation of expression between
  samples for the top 500 dysregulated genes that best distinguish the samples; (D)
  Heatmap of the expression of genes of the OxyR regulon with up-regulated genes in
  blue and down-regulated genes in red [] (fold change); (E) Catalase katG mRNA expression
  levels in response to increasing H2O2 concentrations, as measured by qRT-PCR (mean
  +/− SEM, N = 3).
