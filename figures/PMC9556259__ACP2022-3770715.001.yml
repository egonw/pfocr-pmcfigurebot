caption: Assessment of AKT expression in oral cancer patients analyzed in TCGA datasets.
  (a) The expression levels of AKT in oral tumor tissues were higher than those in
  normal tissues analyzed in TCGA datasets. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 as compared with the normal
  tissues. (b) Protein expression of AKT and p-AKT in CAL27 and SCC25 cells after
  MK2206 2HCl treatment for 24 h by western blotting.
