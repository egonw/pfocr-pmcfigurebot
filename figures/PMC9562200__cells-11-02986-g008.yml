caption: Effect of non-viable Lactobacillus gasseri strains on signaling pathway in
  porcine alveolar macrophages after the activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3).
  Alveolar macrophages were stimulated with non-viable L. gasseri TMT36 (HK36), TMT39
  (HK39), or TMT40 (HK40) and then challenged with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). The
  proteins from lysed cells were extracted at the indicated time points and separated
  by SDS-PAGE. Western-blot was performed to quantify TRAF3/Î²-actin and p-IRF3/IRF3
  ratios. Intensities of proteins bands were calculated from peak area of densitogram
  by using image Lab software. Non-lactobacilli treated alveolar macrophages challenged
  with poly(I:C) were used as controls. The results represent data from three independent
  experiments. Significant differences were observed when compared to polyI(:C)-challenged
  control porcine alveolar macrophages. * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01).
