caption: Analysis of the antigen presentation pathway in the CT26 proteome upon irradiation.A,
  Antigen Presentation Ingenuity Pathway visualized with p-values for quantifiable
  proteins in the CT26 proteome. B, intensity plots of proteins encompassing the antigen
  presentation & ubiquitylation pathways in the CT26 proteome upon irradiation. Points
  are representative of mean ± SD values of three biological replicates and p-values
  are representative of two-way ANOVA, where gray indicates untreated, and orange
  indicates 10 Gy IR treated. C, flow cytometric validation of mouse MHC class I expression
  on the CT26 cell surface upon irradiation. D, Western blot validation of mouse immunoproteasome
  subunits upon irradiation. p-values are representative of a paired student’s t test
  and have been denoted by ∗ <0.05. CT, cancer testis.
