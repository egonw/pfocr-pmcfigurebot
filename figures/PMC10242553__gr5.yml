caption: Network interaction proteins of CD44 and GSEA, KEGG enrichment analysis for
  CD44. (A) The PPI network of CD44 was generated using STRING. (B) Heat maps showing
  the expression-pattern-of-in-sarcoma Genes positively correlated with CD44 in SARC.
  (C) GSEA enrichment analysis for CD44. (D) GO and KEGG enrichment analysis for CD44.
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
  immune infiltration and affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
