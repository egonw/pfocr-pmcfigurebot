caption: Multiple pathways of tumor immune escape mechanism. (a) IFN-γ--JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/2/3-IRF1
  axis mainly regulates the expression of PD-L1 []. If the expression of IFN-γ increases,
  the expression of PD-L1 will increase. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was activated and
  induced T cell inactivation. (b) IFN-γ activates CTLA-4 expression through phosphorylation
  of Jak1/2-STAT1 and then competes with CD28 to bind to B7 [] that inhibits T cell
  activation. (c) IDO suppresses the immune response by metabolizing tryptophan [].
  Its metabolites inhibit T cell activation and promote tumor proliferation. (d) IDO
  expression in THP-1 cells increased M2-type cell polarization []. M2-type macrophages
  inhibit the immune system and promote tumor proliferation and metastasis. (e) T
  cells combine with tumor-associated antigens expressed by tumor cells to exert an
  immune effect.
