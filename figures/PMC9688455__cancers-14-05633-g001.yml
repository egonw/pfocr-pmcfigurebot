caption: Recognized modifications induced by PARP inhibition in the TME. PARPi impair
  DNA repair which produces DNA fragments that are released in the cytoplasm, where
  they activate cGAS inducing STING pathway and the generation of a type I IFN inflammatory
  response. NF-kB is also activated, contributing to the production of inflammatory
  cytokines. DNA fragments can also be released extracellularly inducing paracrine
  GAS/STING response in DCs and increasing the expression of MHC molecules as well
  as antigen presentation. DDR response induces MHC expression in tumor cells, improving
  tumor-associated neo-antigen presentation induced by PARPi. PD-L1 expression is
  up-regulated via cGAS/STING, ATM/ATR pathway and GSK3 inactivation, potentially
  increasing the response to ICIs. PARPi induce NKG2D ligand expression, enhancing
  NK and CD8+ T cell anti-tumor cytotoxicity. See text for a more detailed explanation.
