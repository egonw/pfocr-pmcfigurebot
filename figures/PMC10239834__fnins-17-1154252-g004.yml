caption: Model-3 architecture. The initial stage consists of VSMN that takes the input
  from image sequence. Each tile in VSMN is NF (48 × 48) where neurons are trained
  to encode direction and speed of a dot (2 × 2) within RF (8 × 8). The VSMN response
  obtained at the end of presentation of sequence is used to train CNN after concatenating
  the 10 × 10 tiles responses as a 2D image.
