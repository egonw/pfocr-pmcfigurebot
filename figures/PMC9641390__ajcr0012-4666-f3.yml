caption: Downstream signaling pathways involved in FOXM1/PLK1 axis. A. Venn diagram
  showing proteins negatively or positively associated with FOXM1 or PLK1 and proteins
  shared between FOXM1 and PLK1 on RPPA analysis. B. Linear regression analysis of
  expression levels of FOXM1 and cell cycle-related protein CDK1 and cyclin B1 (CCNB1)
  was plotted in 38 DLBCL cell lines, and the Pearson correlation coefficient and
  P value were determined. C. Model depicting the proposed FOXM1/PLK1 pathway and
  potential mechanism of action, based on the RPPA data of 38 representative DLBCL
  cell lines.
