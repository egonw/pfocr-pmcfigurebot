caption: 'Summary: Discrete light signals regulate crhR expression. (a–c) Three discrete
  light signals regulate crhR expression at distinct points. (a) Light driven redox
  regulation. Under non-permissive conditions when CrhR is not required (dark, blue
  light, or 30 °C) the relatively oxidized PQ pool does not activate a two-component
  signal transduction chain leading to enhanced crhR transcript accumulation. This
  unknown signal transduction pathway is activated by permissive conditions (light
  and 20 °C or abiotic stress) yielding crhR expression. (b) Light quality regulation
  of CrhR accumulation. For conditions under which CrhR is not required and/or expressed
  (dark, blue light or 30 °C) we propose that translation has initiated on crhR transcripts
  however elongation has halted, potentially involving binding of Pr or an unknown
  factor, potentially CrhR (Crh?). Transfer to permissive conditions where CrhR is
  expressed or required (red light and 20 °C) relives the translational block allowing
  translation elongation and full-length CrhR production. In response to dark-light
  transfer, conversion of Pr-CrhR to Pfr-CrhR or binding of activated Pfr to CrhR
  could remove the translational block. (c) Light-dependent proteolysis. A redox-
  and light quality-independent light signal is required for induction of CrhR proteolysis
  in response to temperature upshift from 20 °C to the non-permissive condition, 30
  °C. (d) Dark supersedes the light-based regulatory mechanisms. crhR transcript and
  protein are not observed to accumulate at 20 or 30 °C. This indicates that darkness
  counteracts the low-temperature and light induction signals, reinforcing the requirement
  for light signals for expression.'
