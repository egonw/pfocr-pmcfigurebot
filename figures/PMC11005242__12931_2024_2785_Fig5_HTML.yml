caption: GLUT3 enhanced CSE-induced EMT in BEAS-2B cells. (A-D) Western blot showed
  the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin after 5% CSE treatment of
  BEAS-2B cells for 48 h, (E-I) Transfecting BEAS-2B cells with NC siRNA or GLUT3
  siRNA before control or 5% CSE treatment. The expression of GLUT3, N-cadherin, E-cadherin,
  and vimentin protein in BEAS-2B cells before and after transfection was detected
  by western blots. (J) Immunofluorescence detection showed the expression of E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, and vimentin proteins in BEAS-2B cells. The data are the mean ± SD.
