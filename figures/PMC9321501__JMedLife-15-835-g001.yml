caption: A – The similarities between the expression profiles of genes that were overexpressed
  by Tamoxifen and decreased in the EMT pathway are isolated, and their signaling
  pathway is identified. B – The similarity between the expression profiles of genes
  that reduced expression by Tamoxifen and genes that increased expression in the
  EMT pathway were isolated, and their signal pathway was evaluated.
