caption: 'Complement inhibition assays using truncations of ElpQ and ElpB.A and B,
  classical pathway ELISA inhibition assays were performed using C4b deposition as
  a marker for complement activation. A concentration series of each ElpQ and ElpB
  truncation protein were evaluated in triplicate and shown with SD. IC50 values are
  presented in . A qualitative schematic of ElpQ and ElpB truncation inhibitory activities
  is shown on the bottom panels: wildtype-like inhibition (green), non–wildtype-like
  inhibition (yellow), and no detectable inhibition (red). C, sequence alignment of
  ElpQ181–343 and ElpB182–378 with the N-terminal and C-terminal residue numbers indicated
  above (ElpQ) and below (ElpB). Alignment was performed with EMBOSS Needle and rendering
  performed with ESPript 3.0 (, ). D and E, 2 μM concentration of (D) ElpQ or (E)
  ElpB proteins in classical pathway (CP), lectin pathway (LP), and alternative pathway
  (AP) ELISA complement activation assays. Deposition products C4b (CP–LP) and C3b
  (AP) are presented as a function of no inhibitor controls with error bars denoting
  SD.'
