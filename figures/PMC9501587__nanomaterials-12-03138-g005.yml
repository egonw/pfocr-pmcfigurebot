caption: Bio-MnO2 NPs plus radiation enhanced the activation of cGAS/STING signaling
  pathway. (a) The mRNA levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 5, CXC motif chemokine
  ligand (CXCL) 10 and interferon β (IFN-β) after different treatments in A549 and
  PC9 cells. (b) The secretion of CCL5, CXCL10 and IFN-β detected by Enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after different treatments in A549 and PC9 cells. (c)
  Immunoblotting of the classical cGAS/STING pathway proteins in A549 and PC9 cells.
