caption: 'LINC00674 knockdown attenuates HCC growth in mice. (A) Hep3B cells without
  (NTC) or with LINC00674 knockdown (shLINC#1) were subcutaneously injected into nude
  mice. Four-week tumor growth curves were drawn. (B) RT-qPCR assay was performed
  to detect the LINC00674 level in the xenograft tumor tissues. (C) IHC was carried
  out to determine the levels of Ki-67 and NOX1 in the xenograft tumor tissues. scale
  bar: 60 Âµm.'

  by activating the NOX1/mTOR signaling pathway.
