caption: The function of Pax6 and downstream genes. (A) Subcellular gene localization
  in radial glial (RG) cells. Genes localized in the cell nucleus, cytoplasm, and
  apical and basal endfeet. The graphical diagram has been redrawn from []. (B) Downstream
  genes regulated by Pax6 and their roles. Pax6 regulates Fabp7, Ninein, and Lewis
  X, which are involved in stem cell self-renewal. Pax6 induces Ngn2, Tbr2, and Dmrta1,
  which induce neural differentiation. (C) The Pax6–Ninein network regulates interkinetic
  nuclear migration (INM) during cell-cycle progression in neuroepithelial cells.
  The microtubule cytoskeleton plays an important role in INM, in which the nuclei
  of neuroepithelial cells move apically during G2 phase and basally during G1 phase.
  Ninein, downstream of Pax6, anchors microtubules during elevator movements to control
  the dynamics of INM. The graphical diagram has been redrawn from []. (D) Pax6–Notch
  interaction for neurogenic programs in the developing mouse cortex. Pax6-dependent
  neural differentiation by Notch signaling inhibition generates deeper layer (DL)
  neurons in the early neurogenic phase. Pax6-dependent self-renewal of the RG cells
  which give rise to upper layer (UL) neurons occurs in the middle/late neurogenic
  phase when Notch signaling is absent. In this way, the Pax6–Notch pathway coordinates
  the balance between self-renewal and neural differentiation. The graphical diagram
  has been redrawn from [].
