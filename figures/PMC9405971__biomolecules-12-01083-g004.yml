caption: The eye proteome of wild type Drosophila melanogaster raised on synthetic
  M1 diet (contains vitamin A precursor) or synthetic M0 diet (lacks vitamin A precursors).
  (A) Label-free global eye proteome analysis. The volcano plot shows differentially
  expressed proteins between M1 diet (black) and M0 diet (purple) in the Drosophila
  eye. The statistical cut-off (p-value -log10 1.3, equivalent to p < 0.05) is indicated
  by the dashed line. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  proteins in the eyes of flies raised on M1 diet or M0 diet. Note that the pathways
  ‘phototransduction’ and ‘citrate cycle’ were significantly downregulated in the
  absence of vitamin A, while ‘metabolism of proteins’ was upregulated.
