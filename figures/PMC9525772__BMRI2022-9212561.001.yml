caption: The network pharmacology analysis between TJZYF and decreased endometrial
  receptivity. (a) Venn diagram of overlapped genes between TJZYF and reducing endometrial
  receptivity. (b) Upset map of the intersection gene of TJZYF and decreased endometrial
  receptivity. The upset map is divided into upper (bar graph) and bottom part (bar
  graph on the left, set name in the middle and dot matrix on the right). The horizontal
  bar chart on the bottom left shows the number of elements in each set (the number
  of targets corresponding to each single herb), the set name is obtained from the
  ingredients of TJZYF, and the dot matrix on the bottom right should be interpreted
  together with the bar chart above, and the dots represent related sets. (c) Protein-protein
  interaction (PPI) network diagram. (d) Drug-active ingredient-target network diagram
  of TJZYF and decreased endometrial receptivity. White rectangle represents the targets
  of TJZYF and decreased endometrial receptivity.
