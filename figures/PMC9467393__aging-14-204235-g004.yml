caption: 'Oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in
  LPS-induced mice and LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. (A) Western blotting was used to
  analyze the protein of the MAPK signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells (n=3). Quantitative
  analysis of the protein levels in the MAPK signaling pathway by Image J. (B) Western
  blotting was used to analyze the protein of the MAPK signaling pathway in LPS-induced
  mice(n=3). Quantitative analysis of protein in MAPK signaling pathway by Image J.
  The concentrations of OPD in cell and animal experiments were 12.5μM and 15mg/kg,
  respectively. SEM was used as the error standard for data analysis, and the experiment
  was repeated three times independently. #p < 0.01 and ##p < 0.0001 compared with
  No-treatment group; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001 compared with the
  LPS group. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; OPD: Oxypeucedanin; NT: No-treatment group.'
article_title: Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting
  the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.
