figure_title: SESN2 attenuated ERS through AMPK/mTORC1 pathway
caption: 'a The regulatory effect of SESN2 on the activity of AMPK/mTORC1 pathway
  was analyzed by western blot. Protein biosynthesis signaling downstream of mTORC1
  was monitored by phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6K and 4E-BP. b, c After knockdown
  of SESN2, C2C12 cells were treated with AICAR (an AMPK activator) and rapamycin
  (an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1) to analyze the protective role of AMPK–mTORC1
  pathway against rotenone-induced ERS. d The regulatory effect of SESN2 on AMPK/mTORC1
  pathway was further validated in denervated GAS. Data were presented as mean ± SD.
  n = 6. *P < 0.05 vs control. #P < 0.05 vs rotenone treatment or denervation. Con
  control, Rot rotenone, Den denervation, Rap rapamycin.'
