figure_title: Effects of fucoidan on the expression of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK pathway.
  A549 cells were incubated with fucoidan (0–100 µg/mL) for 48 h. (A) Protein expression
  was evaluated by western blotting and normalized with β-actin. (B) Relative pAkt/Akt
  protein expression. (C) Relative p-p38/p38 protein expression. (D) Relative pERK/ERK
  protein expression. All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
  (n = 4)
caption: ERK1/2, extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.*P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance when compared
  with the untreated control.
article_title: Antimetastatic effect of fucoidan against non-small cell lung cancer
  by suppressing non-receptor tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase
  pathway.
