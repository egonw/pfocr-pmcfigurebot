caption: Transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolites biosynthesis in medicinal
  plants. The pathway-specific functions of transcription factors are illustrated,
  with activators grouped in red and repressors in blue. Different medicinal plants
  contain a number of TFs involved in the biosynthesis pathway. An overview of a transcriptional
  network that is involved in SM biosynthesis in medicinal plants is presented in
  this review. A large number of positive TFs is identified, but the number of negative
  TFs is limited. Negative regulatory TFs also play a critical role in establishing
  the dynamic balance in plant secondary metabolism
