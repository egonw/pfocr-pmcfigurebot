caption: 'Effects of SHYS on PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in DKD model rats. The
  changes in morphology of the mitochondria in the kidney in each group were observed
  by transmission electron microscopy and the levels of proteins related to PINK1/Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy were detected by western blot. (a, b) Transmission electron microscopy
  showed that SHYS treatment improved the morphology of mitochondria in kidney (M
  indicated mitochondria and MS indicated mitophagosomes) (10,000×) (a). The percentage
  of fragmented mitochondria in transmission electron microscopy was calculated. SHYS
  treatment decreased the percentage of fragmented mitochondria in the kidney (b).
  (c, d) SHYS treatment decreased the levels of VDAC1, TOM20, and COXIV in kidney.
  (e, f) SHYS treatment increased the levels of PINK1 and Parkin in the kidney. (g,
  h) SHYS treatment increased the level of LC3-II and decreased the level of p62 in
  kidney. #: P < 0.05 compared with the control group; ##: P < 0.01 compared with
  the control group; ∗: P < 0.05 compared with the model group; ∗∗: P < 0.01 compared
  with the model group.'
