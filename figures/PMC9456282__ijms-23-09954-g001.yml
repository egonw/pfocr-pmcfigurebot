caption: 'Effect of caffeine on the liver structure, liver damage, and oxidative stress
  markers in rats fed a high-fat, -sucrose, and -cholesterol diet plus CCl4 (HFSCD+CCl4
  protocol or NASH model). (A) Macroscopic anatomy and microscopic liver structure.
  H&E staining of hepatic tissues from rats in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine,
  and caffeine groups. Scale bar = 200 and 100 μm. Arrows show nuclei displaced toward
  the periphery of the cells. (B) Markers of liver damage. Serum alanine aminotransferase
  (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities,
  and hepatic glycogen content. Bars represent the mean of experiments performed in
  duplicate ± SEM (n = 8). (C) Oxidative stress markers. Degree of lipid peroxidation
  (LPO) and content of reduced glutathione (GSH). Bars represent the mean of experiments
  performed in duplicate ± SEM (n = 8). Western blot of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and
  nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) proteins. Bars represent the mean of experiments
  performed in duplicate ± SEM (n = 3): β-actin was used as a loading control. (a)
  p < 0.05 compared with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4
  group.'
