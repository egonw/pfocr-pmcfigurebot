caption: (Top) Diagram of data flow through analytic pipelines. Pre-processed resting
  state fMRI data from either baseline or week 2 is fed through a series of operations
  that first generate functional connectivity (FC) features and then generate a predictive
  model based on these features. Alternate approaches are used for parcellation, connectivity
  estimation, dimensionality reduction, and base learner, every combination of which
  is tested for each set of input data, resulting in a total of 240 models for each
  of the baseline and week 2 datasets (5 parcellations × 3 connectivity metrics × 4
  dimensionality reduction techniques × 4 classifiers) – leading to a total of 480
  models. Along the highlighted pathway, for example, pre-processed data collected
  at week 2 is first parcellated using the Power coordinates, resulting in a 259x295
  matrix for each participant’s data, where 259 is the number of regions of interest
  (ROI) included in the power coordinates after SNR masking, and 295 is the length
  of the temporal dimension of the original fMRI dataset. Between every pair of ROIs,
  the correlation between time-courses is then calculated, resulting in a single value
  for every ROI pair. The full set of correlations corresponds to the lower triangle
  of the full correlation matrix, which is then vectorized with a length of 33,411
  for each participant. This process of feature generation is repeated for each participant,
  resulting in a 144x33,411 matrix of FC features. Since feature generation is independent
  of response label, this procedure is completed prior to model generation. Features
  then fed into model generation are scaled, and passed to ANOVA feature selection,
  which chooses the k (value obtained based on internal cross-validation) most relevant
  features to be used in the linear SVM classifier. (Bottom) Delta models are processed
  through the same analytic pathway, with the addition of a subtraction step at the
  end of feature generation. Here, both baseline and week 2 FC features are generated,
  and the difference of the two matrices (the delta FC feature matrix) is used in
  subsequent predictive modelling. An additional 240 models are generated using these
  delta features, considering all possible combinations of processing steps.
