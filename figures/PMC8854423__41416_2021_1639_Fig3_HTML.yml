figure_title: Visualisation of expressional profile and signalling after neoadjuvant
  therapy (NAT)
caption: a Scatter plot analysis of microarray datasets depict the altered expressional
  profiles of PDAC by effective NAT. X and Y-axis show averaged signal values. In
  total, 24,456 probes were examined. The red dots indicate expression of genes changed
  with statistical significance (P < 0.05) between the PDACs with effective NAT and
  PDACs without NAT, whereas the blue dots indicate genes whose expression altered
  without statistical difference. Purple and green lines indicate borders of 1.5-
  and 0.67-fold changes, respectively, in which 1894 genes were upregulated, and 1831
  genes were downregulated by NAT. b Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed downregulated
  pathways by effective NAT. The pathways are ranked from the lowest p values (left)
  to higher (right). The green bars indicate –log (p-value) of each pathway, the strength
  of the statistical association is represented by the length of the bars. The orange
  lines indicate ratio value reflecting the proportion of gene elements in the differentially
  abundant gene list that corresponded to genes in each pathway. c Ingenuity pathway
  analysis depicted that the extracellular/intracellular signalling of Ephrin-A pathway.
  The result suggested that Ephrin-A1 (EFNA1), Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3), Ephrin-A4 (EFNA4),
  and Ephrin-A5 (EFNA5) were affected to EPHA2 and EPHA4 receptors, leading to cross-talking
  to PI3K, SRC, and others. d, e Heat map analyses delineate the dynamic alteration
  of the gene expression profile by NAT in fibroblast and extracellular matrix-associated
  genes.
