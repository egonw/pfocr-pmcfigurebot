caption: Therapy responses prediction based on Hypoxia‐TME classifier. (A) Comparison
  of Hypoxia scores between sorafenib responder and nonresponder. NR (nonresponder),
  RE (responder). (B) Comparison of TME scores between sorafenib responder and nonresponder.
  (C) The different percentages of sorafenib responder among subgroups based on Hypoxia‐TME
  classifier. (D) Comparison of Hypoxia scores among patients with different MAGE‐A3
  immunotherapy response status. NE (not evaluable), NR (nonresponder), RE (responder).
  (E) Comparison of TME scores among patients with different MAGE‐A3 immunotherapy
  response status. (F) The different percentage of MAGE‐A3 immunotherapy responder
  among subgroups based on Hypoxia‐TME classifier. (G) Functional analysis in Hypoxialow/TMEhigh
  (left) and Hypoxiahigh/TMElow (right) of patients under MAGE‐A3 immunotherapy illustrated
  using Proteomaps. Each small polygon corresponds to a single KEGG pathway, and the
  size correlates with the ratio between the subgroups. (H) Functional analysis in
  responder (left) and nonresponder (right) of patients under MAGE‐A3 immunotherapy
  illustrated using Proteomaps. Each small polygon corresponds to a single KEGG pathway,
  and the size correlates with the ratio between the subgroups [Color figure can be
