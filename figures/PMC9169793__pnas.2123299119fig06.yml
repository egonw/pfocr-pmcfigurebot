caption: B. distachyon BGC produces the isoarborinol-derived triterpenoid, brachynacin.
  (A) GC-MS traces for B. distachyon cluster genes transiently expressed in N. benthamiana.
  Marked peaks were identified as isoarborinol (7), 19-hydroxy-isoarborinol (8), 7,19,28-trihydroxy-isoarborinol
  (11), and brachynacin (13) (494.5). (B) Assigned structures and predicted biosynthetic
  pathway of brachynacin in B. distachyon. BdACT, 1,7,19,28-tetrahydroxy-isoarborinol
  acetyltransferase; BdIAH, isoarborinol hydroxylase; BdIAS, isoarborinol synthase;
  BdHIH, 19-hydroxy-isoarborinol hydroxylase; BdTIH, 7,19,28-trihydroxy-isoarborinol
  hydroxylase. (C) Relative abundance of isoarborinol and brachynacin in TMS-derivatized
  extracts of B. distachyon leaves treated with MeJa or H2O for 12 h. Relative quantification
  is based on normalized peak areas in GC-MS analysis of four biological replicates.
  Means of four biological replicates Â± SEM are shown. Asterisks denote t test statistical
  significance. **P < 0.01. (D) GC-MS TICs of N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing
  combinations of wheat and B. distachyon genes.
