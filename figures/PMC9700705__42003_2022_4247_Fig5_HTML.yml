figure_title: Nucleoside degradation networks in halophilic archaea
caption: The results obtained in this study and the distribution of relevant genes
  imply the occurrence of three types of nucleoside degradation pathways in halophilic
  archaea. The three metabolic routes are with NMP phosphorylase and Rubisco (a),
  with Rubisco but without NMP phosphorylase (b), without Rubisco or NMP phosphorylase
  but with RuBP phosphatase and Ru1P aldolase (c).
