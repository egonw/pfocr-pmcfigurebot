caption: 'Schematic comparison of the tumour necrosis factor-α signalling pathway
  and cell fate in nonsilenced AGS, shTNFR1 and shTNFR2 cells with downregulation
  after treatment with Helicobacter pylori extract. After the tumour necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α/TNFR1 interaction, TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  proteins are recruited, which results in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation
  and transcription of prosurvival and antiapoptotic genes, such as CFLIP, that inhibit
  the activity of the death-inducing signalling complex, which is formed after dissociation
  between TRADD and TNFR1. As with TNFR1, TNFR2 stimulation leads to NF-κB activation
  and cell survival; A: Treatment with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) extract resulted
  in increased expression of TNFR1, NFKB1, NFKB2 and CFLIP mRNAs in nonsilenced AGS
  cells. Therefore, the cell survival pathway is activated due to NF-kB activation
  (red ellipse) through the TNFR1-TNF signalling pathway with consequent production
  of the antiapoptotic CFLIP; B: In shTNFR1-H. pylori extract cells, TNFR1 downregulation
  resulted in decreased expression of TRADD and CFLIP mRNAs; however, it did not change
  cell fate; C: In shTNFR2-H. pylori extract cells, TNFR2 downregulation decreased
  the expression of TRAF2 and TRADD, decreased NFKB1, CFLIP and TNFR1 expression,
  and upregulated miR-19a and miR-34a. This led to an increase in apoptosis, impairing
  cell survival due to arrest in the G1/S transition phase.'

  apoptosis and affects the cell cycle of gastric cancer cells.
