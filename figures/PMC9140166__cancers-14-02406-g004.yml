caption: 'Ligustilide downregulated the expression level of VEGFA in CAFs via the
  TLR4-AP-1 signaling pathway. Detection of VEGFA mRNA levels in CAFs treated with
  ligustilide (20 μM) for 0, 6, 12 or 24 h using PCR (A). The mRNA levels of VEGFA,
  α-SMA and S100A4 in ligustilide-treated (20 μM) CAFs and CLI-095 (10 nM) CAFs pretreated
  with ligustilide were detected using PCR (B). The protein levels of α-SMA, VEGFA
  and S100A4 in these cells were detected using Western blotting (C). The amount of
  VEGFA in the culture supernatant of these CAFs was detected using ELISA (D). PBS-treated
  CAFs and NAFs were used as controls. ELISA was used to detect the amount of VEGFA
  in the culture supernatant of ligustilide-treated CAFs and SB203580-, PD98059- or
  SP600125-pretreated CAFs and ligustilide-treated CAFs (E). The expression of VEGFA
  in CAFs was detected using immunofluorescence (F). CAF supernatant decreased VEGFR1
  and increased VEGFR2 at the mRNA level in HUVECs, and ligustilide reversed this
  effect (G). SU14813 partially reduced the suppressive effect of ligustilide-treated
  CAF supernatant on HUVEC migration (H,I). SU14813 is a VEGFR1/2 inhibitor and represents
  HUVECs pretreated with 50 nM SU14813 for 12 h. * p <0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p
  < 0.001, ns: not significant. The original blots could be found in .'
