caption: Loss of Orc6 leads to compromised ATR signaling pathway due to reduced ssDNA
  generation. (A) Western blot analysis of the ATM/ATR pathway in control (Ctrl) and
  Orc6 knockdown U2OS cells. Hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 is indicated by the asterisk.
  (B) Western blot for Orc1, Orc2, and Orc6 knockdown cells. (C) Immunostaining of
  chromatin-associated RPA and rH2AX in control and Orc6-depleted cells treated with
  H2O2. Scale bar, 25 μm. Quantification of RPA signal is shown at bottom. Data are
  reported as mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney test. (D) Schematic of the protocol
  for specifically depleting Orc6 in S phase and collecting DNA damage samples (Upper).
  Shield1 was removed 1 h before H2O2 treatment and cells were collected 1 h after
  treatment. (Lower) Western blot for analyzing ATR activation. (E) Western blot of
  G2 synchronized control and Orc6 knockout (KO) cells. Cyclin B1 as G2 marker. PI
  flow profiles show the synchrony of the cells. (F) Native BrdU staining for visualizing
  ssDNA (Right) and quantification results (Left). Scale bar, 25 μm. PI flow profiles
  show the synchrony of the cells. A representative experiment (n = 3) is shown. Data
  are reported as mean ± SD; n > 100 for each group. ***P < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney
  test. (G) DNA fiber assay to determine nascent DNA resection or degradation after
  fork stalling. A higher IdU to CldU ratio indicates less resection, hence less ssDNA
  generation. A representative experiment (n = 2) is shown. Data are reported as mean
  ± SD. ****P < 0.0001 by unpaired one-tailed Student t test. a.u., arbitrary unit;
  R, removal of Shield1.
