caption: 'Ulinastatin enhanced macrophage efferocytosis and ameliorated LPS‐induced
  inflammatory injury. (A) Effect of UTI on phagocytosis and apoptosis of HL60 cells
  by RAW264.7 cells after using BIX02189. Left panel shows representative fluorescence
  images of HL60 phagocytic apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Scale, 100 μm; (B) UTI enhanced
  the ability of alveolar macrophage to phagocytose apoptotic PMNs after use of BIX02189.
  Representative images of apoptotic PMNs from alveolar macrophage phagocytizing cells,
  scale:100 μm; arrows indicate macrophages containing apoptotic bodies. (C) Hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E) staining of mouse lung tissue after use of BIX02189, scale: 200 μm;
  (D) UTI enhanced the ability of alveolar macrophage to phagocytose apoptotic PMNs
  with XMD8‐92. Representative images of apoptotic PMNs from alveolar macrophages
  phagocytizing cells, scale:100 μm; arrows indicate macrophages containing apoptotic
  bodies. (E) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of mouse lung tissue after use
  of XMD8‐92, scale: 200 μm; (F) Phagocytosis index (BIX02189) based on fluorescence
  images. (G) Phagocytosis index (BIX02189) based on representative images. (H) H&E
  staining was used to assess the pathological score (BIX02189). (I) Phagocytosis
  index (XMD8‐92) based on representative images. (J) H&E staining was used to assess
  the pathological score (XMD8‐92). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation,
  one‐way ANOVA, n = 3. *P < 0.05 vs. UTI + LPS group or 5000 U·mL−1 UTI group. [Colour
