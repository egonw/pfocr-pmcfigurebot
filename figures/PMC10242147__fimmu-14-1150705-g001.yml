caption: The cGAS-STING pathway and disease. (A) Schematic showing diseases where
  STING signaling is thought to contribute to pathology. (B) The presence of mislocalised
  or pathogen associated dsDNA in the cytoplasm is detected by cGAS. Upon DNA binding,
  cGAS undergoes phase separation and generates the cyclic dinucleotide 2’3’-cGAMP
  required by the central hub of DNA sensing – STING – to translocate from the ER
  towards ERGIC. Here, STING recruits TBK1 to phosphorylate the master transcriptional
  regulators of innate immune activation - IRF3 and NF-κB. This results in the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines, primarily type I IFNs but also IL-6 and TNF-α.
