caption: COL12A1 rescued the effects of siMETTL3-1 on proliferation, migration and
  invasion of ESCC. (A-B) siControl+oeCOL12A1 group increased the proliferation and
  clone formation of ESCC compared with siControl+oeVec group, and siMETTL3-1+oeCOL12A1
  group also increased the proliferation and clone formation of ESCC compared with
  siMETTL3-1+oeVec group. (C-D) siControl+oeCOL12A1 group promoted the migration and
  invasion of ESCC compared with siControl+oeVec group, and siMETTL3-1+oeCOL12A1 group
  accelerated the migration and invasion of ESCC compared with siMETTL3-1+oeVec group.
