caption: Fanconi Anemia (FA) Pathway of Interstrand Crosslinks (ICLs). (A) ICLs occurring
  during the S phase of the cell cycle will converge two replication forks creating
  an X-shaped structure surrounding it. TRAIP will ubiquitinate CMG helicase to recruit
  NEIL3 Glycosylase for an incision-dependent unhooking mechanism of ICL resolution.
  (B) Subsequently, CMG is evicted from the chromatin through long Ub chains and p97,
  allowing for the approach of both replication forks towards the ICL. This commits
  the repair to FA pathway-mediated ICL repair. (C) The FA Core Complex is recruited
  to the chromatin through UHRF1 and FANCM-MHF1-MHF2 complex (not depicted). (D) The
  FA Core Complex and UBE2T/FANCT E2 conjugating enzymes will monoubiquitinate FANCD2-I.
  FANCD2-I will recruit Mus81, SLX4, and ERCC4 endonucleases (E) to cleave the DNA
  strand contiguous to the ICL and generate a DNA adduct and an ICL-derived DSB. (F)
  The DNA adduct is bypassed by REV1, REV7/FANCV, and REV3 and a DSB will be repaired
  through HR, respectively.
