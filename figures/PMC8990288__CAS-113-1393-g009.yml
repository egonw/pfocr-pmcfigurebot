caption: Effects of different concentrations of TRAF6 on NF‐κB and VEGF‐C expression
  in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. (A, B) Dual‐luciferase reporter assay analysis
  of pNF‐κB‐Luc at different concentrations of pcDNA3.1‐TRAF6 plasmids in SW480 and
  HCT116 cells. The Renilla luciferase express vector pRL‐TK was used for standardization.
  After transfection for 48 h, the relative activities were measured. (C, D) Dual‐luciferase
  reporter assay analysis of VEGF‐C promoter at different concentrations of pcDNA3.1‐TRAF6
  plasmids in SW480 and HCT116 cells. The Renilla luciferase express vector pRL‐TK
  was used for standardization. After transfection for 48 h, the relative activities
  were measured. (E, F) Western blotting analysis of TRAF6, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C expression
  with different concentrations of pcDNA3.1‐TRAF6 plasmids transfected in SW480 and
  HCT116 cells. GAPDH served as a loading control. (G, H) The relative protein expression
  levels of TRAF6, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C in SW480 and HCT116 cells were quantified. Data
  are shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001
