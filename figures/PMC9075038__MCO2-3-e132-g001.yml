caption: 'Identification of IL‐6 signaling blockade function and novel mechanism exploration
  by RNA‐seq for the h‐mIL‐6R mAb‐treated SIRS model in the IL6r‐e(hIL6R)1 mice. (A)
  The IL6r‐e(hIL6R)1 mice with LPS‐induced SIRS (40 mg/kg, i.p.) were treated with
  the h‐mIL‐6R mAb (2.5 mg/kg) or M‐IgG (2.5 mg/kg). The PBMC for RNA‐seq analysis
  was collected 12 h after the treatments (n = 3). Left: the bubble diagram displayed
  the top differential KEGG pathways enriched by DEGs with q value, rich ratio (the
  proportion of the DEGs to all genes of the enriched pathway) and gene number of
  the included DEGs. Right: the list of the DEGs (p < 0.05, q < 0.1) enriched in the
  pathways showed the absolute value of log2(fold change (FC)) and the corresponding
  KEGG pathways. (B) The PBMC of the IL6r‐e(hIL6R)1 mice (n = 3) with LPS‐induced
  SIRS was collected for verification of the DEGs included in the enriched KEGG pathways
  (except il6 and il6ra) by qRT‐PCR. (C) Immunoblotting and densitometry analysis
  of JAK/STAT3 and JAK/ERK signaling pathways in the co‐treated THP‐1 cells. The THP‐1
  cells were treated with the h‐mIL‐6R mAb/Tocilizumab/M‐IgG for 30 min, then added
  with IL‐6 and co‐treated with the mAbs/M‐IgG and IL‐6 for another 6 h. The eventual
  concentrations of all the agents were: h‐mIL‐6R mAb with 5 or 20 μg/ml, Tocilizumab
  with 5 μg/ml, and IL‐6 with 12.5 ng/ml. (D) qRT‐PCR analysis of TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐6,
  and Ccl2 mRNA levels in the co‐treated THP‐1 cells. The THP‐1 cells were treated
  with the h‐mIL‐6R mAb/Tocilizumab/M‐IgG for 30 min, then added with LPS and co‐treated
  with the mAbs/M‐IgG and LPS for 6 h. The eventual concentrations of all the agents
  were: h‐mIL‐6R mAb with 5 or 20 μg/ml, Tocilizumab with 5 μg/ml, and LPS with 1
  μg/ml. (E,F) ELISA and statistical analysis of TNF‐α and Ccl2 levels in the supernatant
  of the THP‐1 cells with the indicated treatments identical to (D). (G) Immunoblotting
  and densitometry analysis of p65, IκB, and Ccl2 of the THP‐1 cells with the indicated
  treatments identical to (D). (H) Immunoblotting and densitometry analysis of p65,
  IκB, and Ccl2 of the THP‐1 cells with the h‐mIL‐6R mAb (10 μg/mL) and the NF‐κB
  inhibitor BAY 11–7082 (5 μM) treatment for 30 min in advance followed by co‐treatment
  of LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. The results were presented as mean ± SD through three
  independent experiments. The qRT‐PCR and immunoblotting results were normalized
  to β‐actin and the levels of the phosphorylation proteins were normalized to the
  corresponding total proteins. The results of (B–H) were analyzed by one‐way ANOVA.
