caption: 'The anti-inflammatory effect of Rothia mucilaginosa (Rm) is mediated by
  its cell-free supernatant. a) Interleukin (IL)-8 production by three-dimensional
  (3D) A549 epithelial cells after exposure to P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Pa) for 4 h, with
  or without R. mucilaginosa DSM20746 live cells, lysed cells or cell-free supernatant.
  b) Quantification of NF-κB pathway activation after 4 h exposure to lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) (100 μg·mL−1) with or without R. mucilaginosa DSM20746 cell-free supernatant.
  The multiplicity of infection was 10:1 in all experiments. RLU: relative light units;
  NC: negative control (uninfected 3D epithelial cells). Data represent mean±sem,
  n≥3. ***: p<0.001.'
