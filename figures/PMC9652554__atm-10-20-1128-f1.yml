caption: SAAL1 was upregulated in the mouse pneumonia model. (A) The analysis of the
  GEO data showed that SAAL1 was upregulated in the LPS-treated rats. (B-D) A LPS-treated
  mouse model was established. Next, (B) qRT-PCR, (C) immunohistochemical analysis
  (magnification 400Ã—), and (D) western blotting assays were performed to check the
  level of SAAL1 in lung tissues. **, P<0.01 vs. control group. SAAL1, serum amyloid
  A-like 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GEO, Gene Expression
  Omnibus; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain
  reaction.
