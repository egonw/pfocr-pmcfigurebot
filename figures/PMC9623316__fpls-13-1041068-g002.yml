caption: Metabolome analysis of fruits in three periods after gibberellin treatment.
  (A) PCA analysis of metabolites in different treatment groups. (B) KEGG Pathway
  classification annotation of metabolites. (C) DEMs expression heat map, color indicates
  the relative level content of each DEM, from low (purple) to high (red). (D) The
  number of DEMs in the treatment group and CK in the three periods, the number of
  up-regulated and down-regulated DEMs are represented by the bars above and below
  the x-axis, respectively.
