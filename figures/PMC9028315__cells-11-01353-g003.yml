caption: 'Evidence-based alterations in the sphingolipids’ catabolism pathway implicated
  in PD tissues. The overall changes show a decrease in the activity of the enzyme
  which is accompanied by increased levels of substrates [,,,,,]. Corresponding references
  for data, their percentage of changes and tissues of origin are contained in the
  . PD brain data are generated from definitive PD cases and, as such, they are considered
  more valuable than CSF or serum data in describing metabolic shifts. Green-colored
  arrow upward: increase; red-colored arrow downward: decrease; hyphen: no change.
