caption: NBD combined with FMT inhibited inflammatory cytokines in rats with DSS-induced
  colitis. (A-E) NBD combined with FMT downregulates IL-6 (A), IL-1β (B), TNF-α (C),
  COX-2 (D) and iNOS (E) mRNA in colonic tissue of rats with UC. (F) Immunohistochemical
  staining showing F4/80 expression in rats’ colons. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM,
