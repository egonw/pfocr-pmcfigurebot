caption: Mechanism of action of the flavonoid chrysin potentially involved in its
  anxiolytic-like effects. (A) It has been confirmed that chrysin produces its anxiolytic-like
  effect through its action on the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex producing
  configurational changes in the receptor and regulating the opening of the Cl− ion
  channel [,,,,], which may produce inhibitory effects in the GABAergic system associated
  with its anxiolytic-like effects. These effects can be blocked by specific antagonists
  of the GABAA receptor, such as picrotoxin, bicuculline, and flumazenil []. (B) Probably,
  antioxidant effects of chrysin could be involved in its anxiolytic-like effects.
  Chrysin significantly reduces ROS by inhibiting the production of NO, NT, and NOX4
  []. These effects reduce the oxidative stress and reduces the neuronal damage. Additionally,
  chrysin reduces the activity of Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3, while increasing
  the production of Bcl-2, thereby reducing the damage of DNA and inhibiting apoptotic
  processes [,], which reduces the neuronal death. (C) Additionally, the anti-inflammatory
  effects of chrysin could contribute to its anxiolytic-like effects, considering
  that it may reduce the inflammatory response by inhibiting the signaling pathway
  NF-κB/IKK-β [,]. Chrysin may attenuate the expression of NF-κB that participates
  as transcriptional factors at nuclear level, binding to genes that induce neuro-inflammation
  process. Chrysin also inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
  as IL-1β and IL-6, in addition to suppressing the production of proinflammatory
  mediators, such as TNF-α, PGE2 and COX-2 [,,]. These effects could reduce neuro-inflammation
  associated with the anxiety-like behavior. ROS = reactive oxygen species; NO = nitric
  oxide; NT = nitrotyrosine; NOX4 = NADPH oxidase; O2¯ = superoxide; Green circles

  GPx = glutathione peroxidase; Bcl-2 = anti-apoptotic protein of the subfamily Bcl-2;
  Bax = pro-apoptotic protein of the subfamily Bax; NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa B;
  IKK-β = inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β
