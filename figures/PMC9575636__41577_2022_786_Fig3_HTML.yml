figure_title: Current and novel approaches of allergen immunotherapy
caption: At present, long-term tolerance for inhalant allergies may only be achieved
  by allergen immunotherapy with standardized whole allergen extracts via either subcutaneous
  or sublingual routes. To better harness the known underlying mechanisms, novel strategies
  are being explored to achieve safer, effective, more convenient regimens and more
  durable long-term tolerance. These include the combination of allergen extract with
  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the T helper 2 (TH2) cell pathway,
  or with immune modifiers such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Molecular allergology
  has enabled more accurate allergy diagnosis and the development of recombinant whole
  allergens and hypoallergenic variants that, in the future, may result in a more
  individualized ‘tailor-made’ allergen immunotherapy. Allergen-derived peptides have
  been developed to target specifically underlying T or B cell-dependent pathways.
  These are likely to be safer, although so far they have not shown greater efficacy
  over whole allergen approaches that target both pathways. On the basis of the known
  ability of allergen immunotherapy to induce IgE-blocking antibodies, passive immunotherapy
  by injection of cocktails of IgG4 monoclonal antibodies directed against IgE epitopes
  of major allergens has proved successful in inhibiting human nasal allergen challenge
  responses. Oral immunotherapy in children with peanut allergy has been highly effective
  in inducing ‘desensitization’, whereas long-term tolerance remains elusive, and
  the treatment is accompanied by occasional serious systemic side effects. Earlier
  intervention in infancy and early childhood and/or the use of allergen combination
  strategies may overcome these problems. The epicutaneous approach using peanut allergen
  patches may be less effective in desensitization but is able to reduce the risk
  of anaphylaxis on exposure to traces of peanut and this may be a more feasible approach,
  with lower risk of treatment-related systemic side effects. Breg cell, regulatory

  cell, regulatory T cell; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin.
