caption: BMSC‐Exos regulates insulin sensitivity by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. (A–D) Mice were treated as described in Fig. , and iWAT proteins were collected
  for assay. Expression of each group of insulin signaling pathway‐related proteins
  (P‐PI3K, P‐AKT, and GLUT4) was analyzed by western blot (n = 3 per group). (E–H)
  Mature 3T3‐L1 adipocytes were pretreated with BMSC‐Exos (10 and 20 μg·mL−1) for
  24 h. Subsequently, they were treated with 1 mm PA for 24 h and incubated with 100 nm
  insulin for 15 min before sample collection. Expression of each group of insulin
  signaling pathway‐related proteins (P‐PI3K, P‐AKT, and GLUT4) was analyzed by western
  blot (n = 3 per group). The error bars indicate the SEM, whereas comparisons between
  two groups were performed by an unpaired Student's test, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
