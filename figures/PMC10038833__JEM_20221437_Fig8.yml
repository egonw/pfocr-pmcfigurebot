caption: Analysis of signaling pathways and information flow reveals a distinct intestine
  signalome in response to the HFHS diet. (A) Jointly projecting and clustering signaling
  pathways from chow diet intestine and HFHS diet intestine onto shared 2D manifold
  according to functional similarity of the inferred networks. Each dot represents
  the communication network of one signaling pathway. Dot size is proportional to
  the communication probability. Different colors represent different groups of signaling
  pathways. IGF, insulin-like growth factor; GDF, growth differentiation factor; PDGF,
  platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EPHA, ephrin-A; EPHB,
  ephrin-B; APRIL, a proliferation-inducing ligand; SEMA, semaphorin; MPZ, myelin
  protein zero; GH, growth hormone; CEACAM, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
  adhesion molecules; RELN, reelin; TWEAK, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis;
  NRG, neuregulins; SELL, selection; LIFR, LIF receptor; ANGPT, angiopoietin; OSM,
  oncostatin M; ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; THBS, thrombospondin;
  JAM, junctional adhesion molecules; LT, lymphotoxin; PARs, protease-activated receptors;
  SELPLG, selectin P ligand; CLEC, C-type lectin-like receptor; MIF, macrophage migration
  inhibitory factor. (B) Significant signaling pathways were ranked based on differences
  in the overall information flow within the inferred networks between chow diet intestine
  and HFHS diet intestine. The overall information flow of a signaling network is
  calculated by summarizing all communication probabilities in that network. The top
  signaling pathways with P value < 1 × 10−5 were listed. Pathways colored red are
  enriched in HFHS diet intestine, and those colored blue were enriched in the chow
  diet intestine. A paired Wilcoxon test is utilized to determine whether there is
  significant difference between two datasets. (C) Hierarchical plot showing the inferred
  intercellular communication network of NECTIN signaling pathway at chow diet intestine
  and HFHS diet intestine, respectively. Circle color indicates each cell type and
  edge width are proportional to the communication probability.
