caption: Cluster analysis reveals temporally distinct phases of the optic nerve head
  astrocyte response to elevated IOP. Cluster analysis using likelihood ratio test
  (LRT) on the 15,218 genes found to be differentially expressed across time and condition.
  This analysis determines sets of genes that exhibit similar variations in expression
  over time, and which can then be tested for pathway enrichment. 905 significantly
  variable genes were identified with an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05. Over-representation
  analysis, using the Reactome database was used to determine pathways (q-value < 0.2)
  enriched for genes from each cluster

  distinct response to elevated intraocular pressure.
