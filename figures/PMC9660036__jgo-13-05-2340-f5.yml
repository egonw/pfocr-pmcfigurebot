caption: 'P53 overexpression attenuates the function of nestin on CRC migration, invasion,
  and stemness. (A) Transwell assay measurements of cell migration and invasion ability.
  Cells were stained with crystal violet (200×). (B) The number and diameter of spheres
  detected in different groups (40×). (C,D) The expression levels of proteins, including
  Oct4 and Sox2, were determined by western blot assay. ***, P<0.001 vs. vector; ###,
  P<0.001 vs. nestin. n=3. CRC, colorectal cancer.'
