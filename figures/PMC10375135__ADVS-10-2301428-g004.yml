caption: 'Intercellular communication networks in and around mLVs. A) Spatial visualization
  of immune cell infiltration based on mLECs distribution. B) Outgoing and incoming
  signal patterns among all meningeal cells. C) THBS signaling pathway network among
  all cell types. D) Spatial visualization of THBS1‐CD47 L‐R pair distribution by
  stLearn. E) Volcano plots showing that THBS1 is one of the upregulated DEGs in the
  SAH group compared to the NPH group identified by mass spectrometry. F) Quantification
  of THBS1, THBS2, and THBS4 expression in CSF samples from SAH patients compared
  to those from NPH patients by ELISA assay, *** p < 0.001 versus NPH by paired two‐tailed
  Student''s t‐test. G) Representative confocal images of mLVs region of the negative
  control (NC) group and recombinant THBS1 protein treatment (rTHBS1) group. An enlarged
  view of TS and SSS is shown on the right in each group. Lyve1 (blue), Beads (green),
  and CD31 (red). Scale bar: 1000 µm. H) Flow cytometric analysis of mLECs percentage
  in NC group and rTHBS1 group, n = 4 per group, *** p < 0.001 versus NC by paired
  two‐tailed Student''s t‐test. I) Representative images of beads accumulation in
  dCLNs of the NC group and rTHBS1 group. Scale bar: 200 µm.'
