caption: LY294002 reverses the protective effects of sufentanil on the apoptosis of
  OGD/R-induced HCMECs. HCMECs were treated with 10 µM LY294002 for 1 h before 20-µM
  sufentanil treatment. (A) The expression levels of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related
  proteins were detected using western blotting. (B) The viability was detected using
  Cell Counting Kit-8. (C) The LDH activity was detected using LDH assay. (D and E)
  The apoptosis was detected using TUNEL. (F) The expression levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins were detected using western blotting. Data are expressed as the mean ±
  SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. OGD/R, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation;
  HCMECs, human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
