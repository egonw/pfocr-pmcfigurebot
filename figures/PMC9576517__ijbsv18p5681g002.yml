caption: 'The pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of NAFLD/NASH. A: In hepatocytes,
  lipid synthesis, mitochondrial energy homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
  novel mechanisms of peroxisomal involvement in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The lipotoxicity
  arising from free fatty acid produced in hepatocytes elevates the secretion of cytokines
  and chemokines that affect other non-parenchymal cells, including kupffer cells,
  HSC, LESC. B-C: AcAc secreted by hepatocyte mitochondria can enter macrophages across
  cells, and metabolites of ECM can inhibit HSC activation when catalyzed by SCOT.
  Some pathways such as the MerTK-ERK1/2 pathway, produce TGF-Î², which stimulates
  the activation of HSC. Anx A5 is a protein that influences the phenotypic switch
  from M1 to M2 in hepatic macrophages, which secrete cytokines with pro-inflammatory
  effects. D: HSC is stimulated by secreted proteins from other cell types and switches
  from a resting state to an activated state, producing collagen which in turn causes
  fibrosis. E-F: LSEC secretes VCAM-1 in a lipotoxic environment, and monocytes have
  receptors for VCAM-1 on their surface. Adhesion of LSEC to monocytes can contribute
  to the conversion of monocytes to M2 macrophages. G: CD8 T-cell production of auto-aggression
  involves IL-15-driven transcriptional programming. Self-attack by CD8 T cells in
  the liver is involved in liver injury via cell death pathways. Abbreviations: DNL:
