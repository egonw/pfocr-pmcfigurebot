caption: 'NOB did not change the proliferation and apoptosis of BeWo cell lines after
  P53 knockdown. (A) The cell activity was measured using a CCK-8 assay. (B) The morphologies
  of cells were recorded using a microscope. (C) The cell cycle distribution of cells
  was detected using flow cytometry with PI staining. (D) The protein expressions
  of HIF 1α and cl-PARP in cell lysate were detected using Wes, and the relative expression
  levels were quantified. ACTB was used as an internal control, and the relative protein
  expression was the ratio of the target protein to ACTB. (E) The mRNA expressions
  of HIF 1α were estimated using an RT-qPCR. ACTB was used as an internal control.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error (Mean ± SEM). a: comparing with
  the control groups, p < 0.05; b: comparing with the hypoxia groups, p < 0.05; c:
  comparing with the hypoxia+shRNA-P53 groups, p < 0.05; d: comparing with the hypoxia+NOB
  groups, p < 0.05.'
