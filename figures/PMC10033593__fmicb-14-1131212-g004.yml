caption: Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of overlaps of 4,377
  specific up-regulated genes in ZH11-RSMV vs. ZH11 and 856 specific down-regulated
  genes in 17cas-2-1-RSMV vs. ZH11-RSMV. (A) Venn diagrams showing overlaps of up-regulated
  differentially expressed genes in ZH11-RSMV vs. ZH11, 17cas-2-1-RSMV vs. ZH11-RSMV
  and 17cas-2-1 vs. ZH11. (B) Venn diagrams showing overlaps of overlaps of 4,377
  up-regulated genes in ZH11-RSMV vs. ZH11 and 856 down-regulated genes in 17cas-2-1-RSMV
  vs. ZH11-RSMV. (C) Hierarchical clustering of 335 DEGs in (B) based on the log2
  fold change in transcript levels in ZH11 and OsARF17 mutant plants under mock or
  RSMV inoculation. The hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the FPKM
  values of all tested genes. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of 335 DEGs labelled
  in red in (B). “Rich factor” shows the ratio between the number of DEGs and the
  total genes in this pathway. (E) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of 335 DEGs
  labelled in red in (B). The genes were summarized in biological process GO category.
  All differentially expressed genes were selected using cut-off p-value < 0.05 and
  fold-change > 2 compared with controls. Data were collected from three biological
  replicates, each containing a pool of three plants.
