caption: A sketch illustrating the regulation of the IGFBP2 expression by changes
  in nutritional status and the mechanism of IGFBP2 participating in growth and inflammation
  caused by the changes. When geese are overfed with an energy-rich diet, the concentration
  of insulin in the blood is elevated, which inhibits hepatic the IGFBP2 expression,
  and this inhibition can influence the expression of genes in the cytokine−cytokine
  receptor signaling pathway, and vice versa when geese are fasted.

  in Energy Metabolism Mainly through the Cytokine−Cytokine Receptor Pathway.
