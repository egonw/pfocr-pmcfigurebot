caption: 'Process of siRNA mediated RNA interference: The siRNA pathway starts with
  the Dicer enzyme complex cleaving long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into siRNA or
  introducing exogenous siRNA into the cytoplasm. Then siRNAs are bound to Argonaute
  2 (AGO2) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). If the RNA duplex packed
  onto RISC has an ideal complementarity sequence, AGO2 cleaves the passenger (sense)
  strand, resulting in active RISC containing the guide (antisense) strand. The siRNA
  guide strand detects target sites for direct mRNA cleavage (brought out via catalytic
  domain of AGO2), which results in translation inhibition that further blocks protein
  synthesis ().'
