caption: 'Reprogramming of glucose metabolism in cancer cells. (A) Glucose metabolism
  in normal cells; (B) glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Cellular uptake of glucose
  is followed by a series of reactions to transform glucose to pyruvate. Then, glucose
  enters the TCA cycle or is converted to lactate. Enzymes or pathways predominant
  in cancer cells are shown in bold red. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 22
  August 2022). Abbreviations: 1,3 BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2-PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ADP,
  adenosine diphosphate; ALDO, aldolase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate;
  ENO, enolase; F-1,6-BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F-2,6-BP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate;
  F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; G-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; HK, hexokinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GCK, glucokinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; glycerol-3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; OAA, oxaloacetate;
