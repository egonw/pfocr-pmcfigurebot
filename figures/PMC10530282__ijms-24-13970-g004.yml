caption: 'The inhibitory effect of CLC on melanin accumulation and CAMP/PKA/CREB signaling
  pathway under UVB treatment (on the left of (A) are B16-F10 cells irradiated with
  UVB but not incubated with CLC, while on the right are cells that are both irradiated
  and incubated with CLC. (B) is melanin content, (C–I) are the relative mRNA expression
  of PKA, CREB, TRY, TRP1, TRYP2, MITF and 27A, respectively, and (J) is tyrosinase
  activity. n = 3, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. the NC group and * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 vs. the UVB group, ns is no significance).'
