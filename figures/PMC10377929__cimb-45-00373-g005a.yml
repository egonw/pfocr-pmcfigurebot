caption: 'Escin facilitated the proteasomal degradation of GSK3-β in cultured hDPCs.
  The cells were treated with various concentrations of escin for 24 h. The expression
  levels of (a) GSK3 and (b) Axin2 proteins were evaluated via Western blot analysis
  (n = 5). N.S: not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the non-treated
  control. (c) The mRNA expression levels of GSK3 and AXIN2 were monitored via real-time
  PCR analysis (n = 5). N.S: not significant. (d) The effect of the proteasome inhibitor
  MG132 on the protein levels of GSK3 and β-catenin in hDPCs treated with escin for
  24 h (n = 5). N.S: not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to non-treated
  control. Data are expressed as mean ± SD.'
