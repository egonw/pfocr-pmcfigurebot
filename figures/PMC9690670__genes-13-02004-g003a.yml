caption: 'Venn diagrams and pathway enrichment of the DEPs in the roots in comparison
  of salt stress and normal conditions (control) for NA and NN roots. (A): the total
  392 up-regulated proteins; (B): the total 307 down-regulated proteins; (C): the
  pathway changes of the NN plants when comparing salt stress and control conditions
  with MapMan analysis; (D): the pathway changes for NA plants when comparing salt
  stress and control conditions with MapMan analysis. Functional categories enrichment
  was made with Fisherâ€™s exact. Blue color: pathways were significantly over-represented;
  red: pathways were significantly under-represented. NA: alfalfa plants with active
  nodules; NN: alfalfa plants without nodules.'
