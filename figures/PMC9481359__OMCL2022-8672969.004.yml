caption: AKT agonist sc-79 undermined the suppression of DHA on PI3K/AKT and NF-κB
  signal pathways. (a) Western blotting of PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathway proteins under
  indicated treatment for 30 min. (b) Nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (red) was
  determined by immunofluorescence staining under indicated treatment for 30 min.
  DAPI (blue) indicated nuclei. Yellow arrowheads indicated cytoplasmic distribution
  of NF-κB p65. Scale bar =25 μm.
