caption: 'Effects of CCN2Ab on MAPK signaling pathway in high fat fed with diabetes
  mice. A detection of phospho-ERK, total ERK by immunoblot; GAPDH is a protein loading
  control; C detection of phospho-p38, total p38 by immunoblot; ɑ-tubulin is a protein
  loading control; E. detection of phospho-JNK, total JNK by immunoblot; GAPDH is
  a protein loading control. Band intensity in the immunoblot was semi-quantitated
  using ImageLab (B, D and F). Data is mean ± SEM as fold change of Chow + IgG. *p < 0.05,
  significantly different from Chow + IgG, #p < 0.05, significantly different from
  HFD + DM + IgG'
article_title: Targeting CCN2 protects against progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
  in a preclinical model induced by high-fat feeding and type 2 diabetes.
