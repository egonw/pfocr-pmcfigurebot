caption: FZD8 is the downstream target of Ying Yang 1 (YY1). (A) Volcano plots showing
  the differentially expressed genes identified by RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) in PC3‐sg‐YY1
  cells compared to control cells. Cut‐off values were identified with an adjusted
  p‐value < .05 and log2 (|fold change|)  >  1. Red, YY1 positively related genes;
  blue, YY1 negatively associated genes. (B) Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathway analyses of YY1 target genes. (C)
  Differentially expressed downstream target YY1 genes enriched in the Wnt signaling
  pathway. (D) GOChord plot of the functional interaction network of target YY1 genes.
  (E) Venn diagram showing the potential downstream target of YY1 involved in cell
  plasticity. Cut‐off values were identified with a p‐value < .05 and log2 (|fold
  change|)  >  1 for sgYY1 RNAseq; a p‐value < .05 and fold change  >  1.5 for Beltran
  datasets. (F) Level of FZD8 expression in Beltran datasets. (G, H) Level of FZD8
  expression in non‐paired (G) and paired (H) prostate cancer samples in the Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. I Co‐expression analysis of YY1 and FZD8 in GSE3325.
  The correlation coefficient was calculated by Spearman analysis. **p < .01, ***p < .001.
