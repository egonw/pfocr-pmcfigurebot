caption: 'The relative mRNA level of autophagy-related genes BID (a), CASP4 (b), ZFYVE1
  (c), PRKAR1A (d), NPC1 (e), TP53INP2 (f), HSPA8 (g), EIF2S1 (h), and BAG1 (i) in
  ccRCC cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Data were shown as mean ± SD of three
  or four independent experiments. Compared to the 293T group: ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001; compared to the HK-2 group: ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
