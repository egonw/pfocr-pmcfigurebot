  under cold and drought conditions. (a) Expression profile of six genes commonly
  regulated by MaDREB1F overexpression after cold and drought treatments in the JA
  synthesis pathway. (b) Expression profile of five genes in the ethylene synthesis
  pathway commonly regulated by MaDREB1F overexpression after cold and drought treatments.
  (c) Expression profile of 22 ERF genes commonly regulated by MaDREB1F overexpression
  after cold and drought treatments.
