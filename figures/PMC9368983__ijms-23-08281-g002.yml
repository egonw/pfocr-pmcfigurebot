caption: Potential mechanisms underlying the actions of metformin in the brain. In
  neurons, metformin regulates autophagy by AMPK/mTORC1 signaling pathway to alleviate
  abnormal protein aggregation. In addition, metformin decreases oxidative stress
  by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. In astrocytes, metformin suppresses neuroinflammation
  by inhibiting reactive astrocyte proliferation and proinflammatory factors. In synaptic
  transmission, metformin may regulate E/I balance by directly regulating the amount
  of presynaptic neurotransmitter release or altering the expression level of receptors
  on the postsynaptic membrane. Metformin significantly ameliorates synaptic morphological
  defects and enhances synaptic plasticity in a variety of pathological conditions.
