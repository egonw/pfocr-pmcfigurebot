caption: eHistones in sepsis. Histones are released into the extracellular space during
  cell death or NETosis and act as cytotoxic DAMP. eHistones induce proinflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine production through the TLR2/4 signaling pathway. Activation
  of TLR9 by eHistones links to ROS production and inflammasome activation. eHistones
  alter cell membrane permeability. Dysregulation of posttranscriptional alteration
  on citrullination, methylation, and lactylation of histones associates with a suppressive
  immune reaction. eHistones, extracellular histones; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
  Color images are available online.
