figure_title: Translational profiling of POMCDrd2+ neurons indicates enriched Sst
  responsiveness compared with Drd2– POMC neurons
caption: '(A and B) Immunofluorescence staining in ARC of POMCDre Drd2Cre R26-lx-rx-EGFP-L10a
  mice. (A) Scale bar: 50 μm. (B) Percentage of GFP+ POMC neurons. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM; n = 4. P values were calculated using unpaired 2-tailed Student’s
  t tests. **P < 0.01. (C) Differentially enriched genes in immunoprecipitation (IP)
  versus input (IN) of bacTRAP hypothalamus samples of POMCDre Drd2Cre R26-lx-rx-EGFP-L10a
  mice. n = 3 replicates from N = 56 mice. Differential gene expression analysis was
  performed using the DESeq2 1.28.0 () R package. (D) Overlap of differentially enriched
  genes in bacterial artificial chromosome — translating ribosome affinity purification
  (bacTRAP) samples of POMCDre Drd2Cre R26-lx-rx-EGFP-L10a and POMCDre R26-rx-EGFP-L10a
  mice. (E) Gene enrichment in POMCDrd2+ versus whole POMC population. Genes belonging
  to GO term neuropeptide signaling pathway (GO:0007218) are highlighted. For POMCDrd2+:
  n = 3 replicates from N = 56 mice. For POMC: n = 3 replicates from N = 9 mice. (F–H)
  RNA in situ hybridization in ARC of C57BL/6N mice. (F) POMCDrd2– neurons are outlined
  in white, POMCDrd2+ neurons in magenta. Scale bars: 50 μm (left), 20 μm (right).
  (G and H) Signal intensity quantification of Drd2 (G) and Sstr1 (H). Data are represented
  as median ± SEM. n = 1,301–2,961 POMCDrd2– and n = 674–1,468 POMCDrd2+ cells from
  N = 5 mice. P values were calculated using 2-tailed Mann-Whitney rank tests. ****P
  < 0.0001. (I and J) Perforated patch clamp recordings of Sst-treated POMC neurons
  (I) or POMCDrd2+ neurons (J). A neuron was considered responsive if the change in
  firing frequency induced by drug application was 3 times larger than the SD. (K
  and L) Reclustering of Sst neurons from Campbell et al. () (K) and corresponding
  Th RNA expression levels (L). (M and N) RNA in situ hybridization in C57BL/6N mice.
  (M) Percentages of Sst and Th coexpression in hypothalamic and subthalamic dopaminergic
  brain regions. Data are represented as mean ± SEM; n = 5. No statistical tests were
  applied. mt, mammillothalamic tract; A11, A11 dopamine cells. (N) Representative
  image of A11 dopaminergic cell group. Scale bar: 50 μm.'
