caption: Results of the HPLC-MS analysis showing the effect of liquid-to-flask volume
  ratio (A) and rotation speed (B) on the conversion of tryptophan (Trp) to indole-3-acetic
  acid (IAA) via the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway. All cultures were grown
  in YES + Trp medium at 25°C for 24 h. Data are means ± standard error and refer
  to cultures grown at 180 rpm (A) and a medium-to-flask volume ratio (V m/V f) of
  1:10 (B). The graphs show the molar concentration of the single compounds and the
  IAA + IPyA sum. Bars with no letter in common significantly differ at p ≤ 0.05 (Tukey
  HSD test).
