caption: Females exhibit a higher expression of B-cell and T-cell activated signals.
  (A-B) GSEA showing that females exhibit higher expression of B-cell activated signals
  (A) and higher expression of T-cell activated signals (B) than that in males. The
  normalized enrichment scores (NES) and adjust P value (P_adj) were showed on enrichment
  plots. When NES > 0 and P_adj < 0.05, it indicates that this pathway is enriched
  in females. (C) Violin plots demonstrating that six immunoglobulin genes are predominantly
  expressed in the B cells of females
