figure_title: High‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced reprogramming of the hepatic clock and metabolic
  homeostasis
caption: (A) HFD blunts CLOCK:BMAL1 chromatin recruitment to the promoter region of
  Nampt, dampening transcriptional oscillation and as a consequence the oscillation
  of SIRT1 activity. (B) HFD treatment induces dysbiosis. When chow‐diet fed mice
  receive fecal transplantation from HFD‐treated mice, the PPARγ pathway is activated
  in their liver in a ZT‐dependent manner, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming.
  (C) HFD leads to a remarkable and synchronous circadian oscillation of the anabolic
  transcriptional factors SREBP‐1c and PPARγ in the liver, leading to rhythmic de
  novo lipogenesis. SREBP‐1c elevates the levels of the PPARα ligand sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine
  (GPC) (16:0/18:1). Rhythmic GPC (16:0/18:1) level induce circadian hepatic fatty
  acid oxidation. (D) HFD increases GR binding near promoters and enhances GR‐STAT5
  co‐occupancy in target genes related to glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.
