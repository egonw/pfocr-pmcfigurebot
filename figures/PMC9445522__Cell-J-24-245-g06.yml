caption: VGLL4 was the target of miR-346 in NSCLC cells and positively regulated by
  circ_0006427. A. Bioinformatics analysis predicted binding sequence between miR-346
  and VGLL4. B. Binding relationship between miR-346 and VGLL4 was verified using
  the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. C, D. VGLL4 mRNA and protein expressions
  in A549 and H292 cells transfected with circ_0006427 overexpression plasmid or co-transfected
  with miR-346 mimics were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Original blots are
  shown in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org), Figure
  6D. E and F. Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis was applied to determine correlation
  of VGLL4 mRNA with circ_0006427 or miR-346 expression in NSCLC tissues. All experiments
  were repeated thrice with triplicate samples in each experiment. *; P<0.05, NSCLC;
