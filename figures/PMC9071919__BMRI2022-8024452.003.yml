caption: Hydrogen inhibits CRC cell proliferation by decreasing pAKT/SCD1. (a) IHC
  assay in tumors (RKO cells) after H2 treatment and control (100x). (b) Western blot
  analysis showing the expression levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, pAKT, and SCD1 in RKO,
  SW480, and HCT116 cells before and after H2 treatment. Western blotting assays showed
  that the expression of SCD1 was significantly upregulated and presented a dose-dependent
  effect with SC79 treatment. (c) The inhibition of cell proliferation induced by
  H2 was reversed when cells were treated with SC79, as determined by the CCK-8 assay.
