caption: Overexpression of IL-6 reversed the roles of miR-149 mimics in GC cells.
  After co-transfection with miR-149 mimics and vector IL-6 into MKN-28 and MGC-803,
  the CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were performed to detect cell viability
  (A) and apoptosis (B, C); protein expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 was measured by
  western blotting (D)*P < 0.05.
