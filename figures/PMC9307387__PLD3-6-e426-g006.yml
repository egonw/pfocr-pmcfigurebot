caption: Effects of belowground and aboveground insect herbivory on salicylic acid
  (SA) pathway gene expression. (a) Schematic diagram of the SA biosynthesis pathway.
  ICS, isochorismate synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; EDS, enhanced disease
  susceptibility; isochorismate is transported by the multidrug and toxin extrusion
  (MATE) transporter EDS to the cytosol. PBS3, avrPphB susceptible 3; EPS1, enhanced
  pseudomonas susceptibility 1. (b and c) Heat map of SA biosynthesis‐related gene
  expression in maize shoot (b) and roots (c). Samples were collected from maize plants
  that were kept non‐manipulated (C, control) or after 72 h of belowground infestation
  by  Diabrotica virgifera virgifera  (DV), mechanical damage on root (MR), 72 h of
  aboveground infestation by  Spodoptera frugiperda  (SF), or mechanical damage on
  shoot (MS). Color coding represents the range of log2(fold change relative to control).
