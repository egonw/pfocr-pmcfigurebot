caption: Pharmacologic inhibition of GPX4 with RSL3 induces ferroptosis activation,
  intracellular lipid peroxidation, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
  PTC in vitro. (A) Immunofluorescent staining for TfR1 in K1 cells treated with DMSO
  control or RSL3 (0.1 μM) for 6 h showed increased TfR1 expression relative to control-cells
  (94.7% vs 57.3%; p = 0.003; TfR1 = red, DAPI = blue, 20 × magnification). (B) RSL3
  induced increased TfR1 protein expression after 4 h treatment in dose-dependent
  manner. (C) Staining of K1 cells with BODIPY 581/591 C11 lipid peroxidation dye,
  a ferroptosis marker, in RSL3 (3 μM; 4 h) and ferrostatin-1 (Fer1, 5 μM)-treated
  cells. (D) Induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by RSL3 treatment
  (24 h) in MDA-T32 cancer cells and control HThF cells (*p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001).
