figure_title: Rnd1 knockdown disrupts the calcium signalling pathway
caption: A HEK293 cells were transfected with IFNβ reporter plasmid along with either
  the vector backbone (Ctrl), Rnd1 or IPS-1 expressing plasmids followed by PR8 infection;
  IPS-1 was used as a positive control. B Rnd1 was overexpressed in A549 cells and
  followed by disruption of Type-I interferon signalling using IFNAR2 blocking antibody.
  PR8 viral load and IFNβ were analysed 24 h post infection. C Volcano plot indicating
  down-regulated (green) and upregulated (red) genes. D Pathway analysis indicating
  downregulated pathways from three different databases- KEGG, BioPlanet and Wiki
  Pathways, top significant pathways have been highlighted. E Heatmap of calcium signalling
  pathway genes that are dysregulated by Rnd1 knockdown. F Analysis of selected genes
  after knockdown from heatmap by RT-PCR to verify the results of RNA-Seq experiment.
  G Analysis of RhoA activation after siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rnd1 in A549 cells.
  RT-PCR and promoter-reporter assay data are means ± SEMs from triplicate samples
  of a single experiment and are representative of results from three independent
  experiments. RNA-Seq data are representative of a single experiment with two replicates.
