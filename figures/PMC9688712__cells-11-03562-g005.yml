caption: mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes and regulatory genes in 24 and
  96 hpf embryos after honokiol microemulsion treatment. The mRNA expression levels
  of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic genes are shown in (A). The mRNA expression levels
  of apoptosis regulatory FoxO subtypes are shown in (B). The data are expressed as
  the mean Â± SD (** p < 0.01 compared with control).
