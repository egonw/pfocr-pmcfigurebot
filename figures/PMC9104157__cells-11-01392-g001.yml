caption: Metabolic changes regulate expression of proteins involved in FA transport
  through the ERK5/MEF2 pathway. (A) CD36 mRNA (up; analyzed by qRT-PCR) or CD36 membrane
  protein (bottom; analyzed by FACS analysis) were analyzed as described in Materials
  and Methods section in different cell types treated for 3 days with DCA (5 mM or
  as indicated) or growing in a glucose-free medium (OXP) that supports OXPHOS for
  5–7 days. (B) NSG mice were engrafted with primary human AML cells. At day 80 post-graft,
  they were treated with DCA (n = 4) or left untreated (n = 4). At day 140, mRNA from
  bone marrow or spleen was isolated and human CD36 mRNA was quantified by qPCR. (C,D)
  Cells were treated with siRNA for ERK5 (primary hepatocytes) or MEF2 (OCI-AML cells),
  and 3 days later we analyzed CD36 mRNA expression. (E) Cells were treated as in
  (A) and LRP1 mRNA (up) or LRP1 membrane protein (bottom) were analyzed as described
  in (A). Bar graphs represent means ± SD of at least 3 independent experiments performed
  in triplicate. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005 compared to control cells.
