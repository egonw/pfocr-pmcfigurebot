caption: 'The effect of glucose on autophagy, inflammation, and ROS of HRGECs with
  a time- and concentration-dependent manner. (a–c) The effect of high concentration
  glucose (30 mmol/L) on AIF-1, miR-34a, ATG4B, LC3II, p62, NLRP3, and ROS level in
  HRGECs with a time-dependent manner. Versus 0 h group, ∗P < 0.001. (d–f) The effect
  of glucose on AIF-1, miR-34a, ATG4B, LC3II, p62, NLRP3, and ROS level in HRGECs
  with a concentration-dependent manner for 48 h. All the relative levels of results
  were corrected by total protein. Versus 5.6 mmol/L glucose group, ∗P < 0.01. HRGECs:
  human renal glomerular endothelial cells; AIF-1: allograft inflammatory factor-1;
  miR-34a: microRNA 34a; ATG4B: autophagy related 4 homolog B; LC3II and p62: autophagy-associated
  protein; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3; ROS:
  reactive oxygen species.'
