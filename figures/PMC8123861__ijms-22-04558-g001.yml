caption: PGC-1α is involved in the pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis and consumption in
  the metabolic tissue such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. (A). NAD+ de novo
  synthesis from Trp. PGC-1α may promote QA synthesis via blocking ACMSD. PGC-1α1
  may promote de novo synthesis via KAT activation. (B). NAD+ biosynthesis from NA
  in the Preiss–Handler pathway; QA from de novo synthesis also can be synthesized
  to NAD+ in the Preiss–Handler pathway. (C). PGC-1α may influence many enzymes in
  the salvage pathway. ACMS, α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde; ACMSD, ACMS
  decarboxylase; NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferases (three isoforms exist);
  NMNAT, NMN adenylyltransferase; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Dashed lines
  indicate additional evidence is required to reveal the mechanisms.
