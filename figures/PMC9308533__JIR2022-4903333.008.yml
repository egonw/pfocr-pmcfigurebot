caption: FKB-treated gastric cancer cells polarize macrophages toward M1 phenotype
  and weaken macrophage migration. (a–e) Western blot of the expression of iNOS and
  CD86 (M1) as well as Arg-1 and CD206 (M2) in THP-1 cells treated with conditioned
  media from normal or FKB-treated SGC-7901 cells. (f, g) Transwell of THP-1 cells
  treated with conditioned media from normal or FKB-treated SGC-7901 cells. Bar, 100 μm.
  (h, i) Western blot of the expression of CCR2 in THP-1 cells treated with conditioned
  media from normal or FKB-treated SGC-7901 cells. ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
