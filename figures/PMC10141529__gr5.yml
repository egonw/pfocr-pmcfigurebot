caption: Gene expression analysis of tumor organoids and fibroblasts. (A) PCA plot
  of organoid samples grown in minimal medium (O_min), conventional organoid medium
  (O_ENAS), or together with NFs (O_NF) or CAFs (O_CAF) plotted in 2 dimensions using
  their projections onto the first 2 principal components based on RNA-seq data. The
  different conditions are color coded. (B) Hierarchical clustering of significantly
  differentially expressed genes in organoids grown in different conditions as in
  (A) as identified from RNA-seq analyses. Numbers and colors on the left of the heatmap
  indicate 4 different groups of genes that were upregulated in O_min (1, red), upregulated
  in O_ENAS (2, black), upregulated in the co-cultures O_NF and O_CAF (3, orange),
  or downregulated in O_ENAS (4, grey). The illustration below the heatmap shows the
  experimental setup. (C) Reactome pathway analysis shows the top significantly altered
  pathways between the individual growth conditions of organoids. Size of circles
  defines the number of genes affected in the respective pathway and the color indicates
  the significance (adjusted P value) according to the color gradient shown. (D) PCA
  plot of fibroblasts including NFs and CAFs grown either alone (NF, CAF) or in co-culture
  with tumor organoids (NF_O, CAF_O) (indicated by colors) plotted in 2 dimensions
  using their projections onto the first 2 principal components based on RNA-seq data.
  (E) Hierarchical clustering of significantly differentially expressed genes of NFs
  and CAFs grown in different conditions as in (D). Rectangles on the heatmap mark
  genes that were specifically upregulated in the co-culture conditions in NFs and
  CAFs compared with the mono-cultures. (F) Bubble chart lists the top significantly
  changed pathways using Reactome pathway analysis in fibroblasts based on the different
  culturing conditions. The number of genes involved in the respective pathway is
  shown by the size of the circles and the significance by the color according to
  the color gradient. The RNA-seq analyses were performed in triplicates for 3 individual
  patients (P1‒3) (9 replicates in total) (P adj. < .05).
