figure_title: Pharmaceutical inhibition of SMYD3 inhibits the proliferation in GC
  cells
caption: 'A SMYD3 inhibitor BCI-121 (100 μM) substantially mitigated the cellular
  proliferation of HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells within the indicated time interval by
  CCK-8 assay. B BCI-121 remarkably reduced the level of H4K20me3 and p-Akt (S473),
  as well as increased EMP1 protein level in HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells by immunoblot
  assay. C Intratumoral injection of BCI-121 (100 μM) markedly repressed the growth
  of SGC-7901 cells in vivo. D Tumor growth curves and tumor weight shows that BCI-121
  markedly repressed the growth of SGC-7901 cells in vivo. E IHC shows that Ki-67
  staining was markedly weaker in tumor masses originated from BCI-121-treated mice.
  F Administration of BCI-121 in vivo did not elicit evident damages to the livers
  and kidneys of the BCI-121-treated mice by HE staining assay. G Schematic diagram:
  SMYD3 promoted Akt signaling pathway and thus the proliferation via H4K20me3-mediated
  suppression of EMP1 expression in GC cells.'
