caption: TRPM2 KD promoted the ubiquitination of HIF-1α and Nrf2. A Image generated
  by STRING (https://string-db.org/). B Potential mechanistic pathway by which TRPM2
  promotes the stability of HIF-1α and Nrf2. C Cells were harvested and lysed, followed
  by IP with anti-HIF-1α and anti-Nrf2 antibody. Immunoblotting was employed for Ubiquitin,
  HIF-1α and Nrf2. KD knockdown
article_title: Silencing TRPM2 enhanced erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis in gastric
  cancer cells through destabilizing HIF-1α and Nrf2 proteins.
