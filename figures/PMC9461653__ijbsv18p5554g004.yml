caption: Pathway enrichment analysis. (A) Schematics of frequently altered pathways
  in HAS compared with non-HAS. Three key pathways including RTK/RAS/PI(3)K pathway,
  cell cycle pathway, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells
  were identified. Upper and lower row represents HAS and non-HAS in a square grid,
  respectively. The percentage represents the alteration frequency. (B) Comparison
  of genomic alterations involved in the enriched pathways between HAS and non-HAS.
  (C-D) Association of RTK/RAS/PI(3)K pathway, cell cycle pathway, and signaling pathways
  regulating pluripotency of stem cells with overall survival in HAS (C) and non-HAS
  (D), respectively. (E) Association of RTK/RAS/PI(3)K pathway, cell cycle pathway,
  and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells with liver metastasis
  in HAS and non-HAS.
