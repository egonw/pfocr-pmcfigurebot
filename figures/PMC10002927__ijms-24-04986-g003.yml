caption: 'Pregnancy-related signaling pathways of chromogranin A and catestatin. Schematic
  representation of the signaling pathways activated duringpregnancy. MEKK: MAPK/ERK
  kinase. Light pink color marks pathways activated with IGF-1, resulting in CgA promoter
  activation. Orange color marks signaling pathways activated by CgA-derived peptide,
  CST. Additional relationship between CgA and Akt, through up-regulation of survivin
  protein, was marked with sea color. Gray color represents MAPKs signaling pathway,
  blue PI3K/Akt signaling pathway; black is reserved for each pathwayâ€™s end-effect
  related to CgA.'
