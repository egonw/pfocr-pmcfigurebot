figure_title: Midkine suppresses AMPK activation in an intracellular localization-dependent
  manner
caption: a MDK expression in the cell lysate and conditioned medium (CM) of HepG2,
  HCCLM3, Bel-7402, and SMMC-7721 cells was tested by immunoblotting. b CM from MDK-overexpressing
  MHCC97H cells was harvested and used to culture Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells for
  2 h, intracellular MDK was tested by western blotting. c Cytoplasmic and nuclear
  fractions of the MDK overexpressing MHCC97H cells and the control cells was prepared
  and the distribution of MDK was detected by immunoblotting. d Signaling pathway
  enrichment assay with MDK-correlated genes based on the TCGA database. We first
  defined MDK correlated genes by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients
  between MDK and all other genes according to their mRNA expression levels (data
  from the TCGA RNA-seq datasets). Then the overlap significance between MDK correlated
  genes and pathway genes (data from KEGG) was examined. Then the GSEA-based pathway
  enrichment was performed. e–f Analysis of p-AMPKα Thr172 level affected by MDK.
  MDK overexpressing Bel-7402 cells and control cells were treated at different glucose
  concentration (25 mM and 1 mM) for 2 h (e), or with 10 mM 2DG for 4 h (f), then
  the cells was lysed and the indicated proteins were tested with immunoblotting.
  g MDK overexpressing cells and control cells were subjected to glucose starvation
  for the indicated time, then the cells were harvested for western blotting. h Knock-down
  of MDK in HCCLM3 cells with two independent shRNAs resulted in elevated p-AMPKα
  Thr172 level after 4 h treatment of 10 mM 2DG. i Western blotting of the MHCC97H
  cells at different time points of CM treatment. CM is from MDK-overexpressing MHCC97H
  cells. j MDK knocked-down HCCLM3 cells and the control cells were treated with or
  without heparin treatment (30 μg/ml) for 4 h under 10 mM 2DG culture conditions,
  following by immunoblotting to test the indicated protein level. k–l The Bel-7402
  (k) and MHCC97H (l) cells were subjected to a combination treatment with or without
  MDK- CM and heparin (30 μg/ml) for 2 h, then western blotting was performed to test
  the p-AMPKα Thr172 level.
