caption: Prediction of functional microbial metabolic pathways using PICRUSt 2 analysis
  with the MetaCyc database. The graphics show the abundance of (A) thirteen statistically
  significant metabolic pathways between CO (blue color) and GD (red color) bacterial
  communities. (B) Twenty-seven statistically significant metabolic pathways between
  CO (blue color) and PD (green color) bacterial communities; and (C) one statistically
  significant metabolic pathway between CO (blue color) and PE (orange color) bacterial
  communities. Confidence intervals are indicated on top, while the mean proportions
  and differences in mean proportions with percentage scale are shown underneath each
  graphic. Groups are identified by a tab placed below the graphics. A Welch test
  was applied with a Bonferroni post-hoc. Corrected p-values are shown on the right
  side of each graphic. —(see  for all included statistically significant pathways
  q < 0.05).
