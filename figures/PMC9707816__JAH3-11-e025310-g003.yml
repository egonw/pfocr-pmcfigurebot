figure_title: Analysis of lipopolysaccharide‐induced changes in myocardial metabolites
  and the effects of TB‐peptide in young mice
caption: Mice were given 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneally and heart tissues
  were harvested 18 hours later. A, Volcano plots generated using GraphPad Prism software
  showing metabolite‐wise fold changes (log2 FC) plotted against false discovery rate
  (FDR, −log10 FDR). Significantly differentially abundant metabolites were indicated
  in red for upregulation and blue for downregulation (FDR ≤10%, FDR was determined
  using Benjamin‐Hochberg procedure). B, Comparison of lipopolysaccharide‐induced
  changes between groups with and without the treatment of TB‐peptide. Degrees of
  fold change in abundance were shown in bar graphs. Results obtained from sham and
  lipopolysaccharide‐challenged groups without the treatment of TB‐peptide were shown
  in blue, and those from groups given treatment were shown in red. C, Metabolic pathways
  altered by lipopolysaccharide in the young hearts. D, TB‐peptide‐mediated regulation
  of metabolic pathways in the young hearts challenged by lipopolysaccharide. In (C
  and D) pathway analysis was performed by using Shiny GAM (integrated analysis of
  genes and metabolites) and Cytoscape software. Signaling networks were built on
  pathway clustering against the small molecule pathway database using MBRole 2.0
  software. FC, fold change; FDR, false discovery rate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NAD,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; and UDP, Uridine diphosphate.
