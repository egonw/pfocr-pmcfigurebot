caption: Diagram of the pathway system, and naming of variables for the Fe and Zn
  uptake system in Arabidopsis. The ability of WBC19 to transport Zn-NA or NA is not
  critical to the model and therefore represented by grey lines. Similarly, initially
  considered but ultimately unimportant regulatory signals are shown in grey.
