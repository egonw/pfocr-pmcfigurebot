figure_title: TINCR regulated ATG5-mediated autophagy
caption: 'A GO pathway analysis showed the involvement of autophagy in TINCR regulation.
  B After TINCR depletion, the level of autophagy-related proteins were detected by
  western blotting. C LC3 fluorescence intensity was assessed by confocal microscope.
  Scale bar: 10 μm. D Representative images of autophagosome detected by TEM. E ATG5
  expression in HCC tissues was evaluated by qRT-PCR. F ATG5 expression was positively
  correlated with TINCR expression (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001). G When LCSCs were treated
  with Baf-A1 (75 nM) or ATG5 siRNA, sphere formation was attenuated both in these
  two groups. Data are shown as means ± SD. *p < 0.05.'
