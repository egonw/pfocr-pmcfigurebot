caption: CASC11 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by stimulating G1/S cell
  cycle transition. (A-C) CASC11 knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase
  in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. *P<0.05 vs. sh-NC (G1 and S stages). (D-F) CASC11 overexpression
  resulted in cell cycle arrest at S phase in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. *P<0.05 vs. sh-NC
  (S stage). Western blot analysis was used to detect the effects of CASC11 (G) knockdown
  and (H) overexpression on the expression levels of cell cycle-associated proteins
  in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. sh-NC or vector, or as indicated.
  CASC11, cancer susceptibility candidate 11; NC, negative control; OE-CASC11, CASC11
  overexpression plasmid; sh, short hairpin.
article_title: Long non-coding RNA CASC11 interacts with YBX1 to promote prostate
  cancer progression by suppressing the p53 pathway.
