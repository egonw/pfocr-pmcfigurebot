caption: 'Assessment of TNFα signaling pathway in pre-symptomatic APP/PS1mouse retina.
  (A) Analysis of NFkB (WT n = 5:2F + 3M; TG n = 9:5F + 4M), (B) total-IkB (WT n =
  9:4F + 5M; TG n = 9:4F + 5M) and (C) phospho-IkB protein (WT n = 9:4F + 5M; TG n
  = 9: 4F + 5M) expression by western blot. Representative western blot images are
  shown above the relevant quantification. All western blot images shown are from
  the same n = 4 TG and n = 4 WT mice aged 3 months out of a total n = 9 and n = 9
  for TG and WT mice, respectively. Quantification was performed after normalization
  over β-actin, used as a loading control. (D) NFkB activation index as expressed
  by the ratio of phospho-IkB over total-IkB expression. **** p < 0.0001.'
