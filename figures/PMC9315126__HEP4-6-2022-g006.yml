caption: Top canonical pathways identified by IPA of the quantitative hepatic phosphoproteome
  in response to chronic ethanol in C57BL/6 and Rip3‐deficient mice. IPA core analysis
  of phosphorylation sites in liver of (A) pair‐fed controls between genotypes, (B)
  ethanol‐fed mice between genotypes, (C) in response to chronic ethanol feeding in
  C57BL/6 and (D) Rip3‐deficient mice with increased or decreased phosphorylation
  (p < 0.05). P values show the significance of enrichment for the most highly expressed
  genes. Fisher's exact test P values (hypergeometric test, p < 0.05) were corrected
  for multiple testing, using the Benjamini‐Hochberg false discovery rate. AKT, protein
  kinase B; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase; B‐H, Benjamini‐Hochberg;
  CoA, coenzyme A; eIF4, eukaryotic initiation factor 4; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase; EtOH, ethanol; GTPase, guanosine triphosphatase; IGF, insulin‐like growth
  factor; IL, interleukin; ILK, integrin‐linked kinase; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis;
  IRF, interferon regulatory factor; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF‐kB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; NGF, nerve growth factor; p70S7K, protein 70 serine 6 kinase;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKR, protein kinase R; PPAR,
  peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; PXR,
  pregnane X receptor; RHOA, Ras homolog family member A; RHOGDI, Rho guanosine diphosphate
  dissociation inhibitor; RIG1, retinoic acid‐inducible gene; Rip3, receptor‐interacting
  protein kinase 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SAPK,
  stress‐activated protein kinase; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; TR, thyroid
  hormone receptor

  protein kinase 3 in alcohol‐associated liver disease and uncovers apoptosis signal‐regulating
  kinase 1 as a target.
