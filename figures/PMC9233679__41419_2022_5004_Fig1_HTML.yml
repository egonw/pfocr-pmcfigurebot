figure_title: S100A11 expression is upregulated and predicts poor prognosis of patients
  with PDAC
caption: 'A Analysis of S100A11 protein expression in PDAC and paracancerous tissues
  through IHC-based TMA (inset: 20× magnified image). B, D Violin plots demonstrating
  the difference in S100A11 expression between PDAC and paired paracancerous samples
  in the TMA cohort and TCGA database, respectively. C, E Kaplan–Meier analyses of
  the association between S100A11 expression and OS of PDAC from the TMA cohort and
  TCGA database, respectively. F Correlation analysis between the S100A11 expression
  and clinicopathological characteristics using online TCGA case cohort. G, H Univariate
  and multivariate Cox regression analyses of the relationship between the expression
  of S100A11 and clinicopathological factors with TCGA database. T, pancreatic cancer
  tissues. NT, normal paracancerous tissues. *p < 0.05.'
article_title: S100A11 activates the pentose phosphate pathway to induce malignant
  biological behaviour of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
