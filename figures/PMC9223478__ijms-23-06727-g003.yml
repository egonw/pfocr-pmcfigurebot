caption: Activation of the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway during lysine deprivation. The
  level and/or phosphorylation of eIF2α, ATF4, and S6, were examined by Western blots
  (A) and quantitated (B) in lysine deprivation for up to 240 min. Band densities
  were quantified by Image J software. Results were expressed as means ± standard
  errors from at least three independent experiments. Labeled means without a common
  lowercase letter differ significantly (p < 0.05).
