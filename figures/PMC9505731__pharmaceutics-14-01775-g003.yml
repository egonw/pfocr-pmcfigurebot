caption: Correlation between Nrf2 and NF-κB in counteracting inflammation-associated
  cancer. Activation of Nrf2 after binding to antioxidant response element (ARE) leads
  to the production of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, UGT, NQO1, GST), which can lead
  to suppression of NF-κB. This leads to indirect inhibition of NF-κB targets enzymes
  such as NO, COX-2, and iNOS. The overall effect is a reduction in oxidative stress
  and inflammation by the Nrf2 pathway, which can serve as a valuable target in preventing
  inflammation-associated cancer.
