figure_title: Rptor depletion impairs the expression of genes involved in the development
  and differentiation of vaginal epithelium
caption: A RNAseq analysis was performed using the vagina of OVX WT mice and Rptor
  cKO mice with or without 3 day-E2 administration. The number of the differentially
  expressed genes of the above four groups are plotted. B Heatmap of significantly
  changing genes in the vagina among the above four groups in A belonging to six major
  classes as indicated. C The GO terms of significantly changed genes in the green
  frame in B were enriched using the Cytoscape plug-in ClueGO. D GSEA analysis using
  the GO terms. E Heatmap of the expression level of keratinocyte differentiation-related
  genes from the significantly changing genes in the green frame in B. F Expression
  of Krt6a, Krt6b, Krt10, Krt13, Krt16 was quantified using qPCR in the vagina of
  the mice indicated in A. n = 7 (OVX control mice), n = 5 (OVX Rptor cKO mice), n = 6
  (OVX control mice treated with E2), n = 5 (OVX Rptor cKO mice treated with E2).
  Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. G GSEA enrichment analysis of the transcriptome
  of vaginal biopsies from post-menopausal women with vaginal dryness (n = 4), and
  post-menopausal controls without vaginal dryness (n = 6) (GSE26761). H GSEA enrichment
  analysis of the transcriptome of vaginal biopsies from post-menopausal women suffering
  from vaginal dryness pre and post 3-month E2 therapy (n = 19) (GSE11622).
