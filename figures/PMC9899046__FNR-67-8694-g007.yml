caption: 'IP3 regulates the FOXO3/CCND1 signaling pathway in IEC-6 cells. (a) Western
  blotting analysis of IEC-6 cells was performed to detect the protein expression
  levels of HDAC3, H3K9AC, FOXO3, and CCND1. Histone H3 was used as an internal control.
  (b) Relative protein expression of HDAC3, H3K9AC, FOXO3, and CCND1 of the mucosa
  in the distal small intestine. Values are mean Â± SEM; ns, not significant; * P <
  0.05, ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001, SBS group versus Sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P
  < 0.01, SBS + IP6 group versus SBS group.'
