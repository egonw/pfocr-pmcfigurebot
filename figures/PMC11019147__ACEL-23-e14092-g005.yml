caption: 'Autophagy‐related signaling transduction in osteoclasts. Three major complexes
  are involved in the autophagy process: the mTORC1, ULK complex, and PI3K complex.
  Important signaling pathways related to osteoclast activities, such as the RANKL
  signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway, are regulated
  by these three complexes. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein
  kinase; Bcl2, B‐cell lymphoma 2; BNIP3, BCL2 interacting protein 3; HIF‐1α, hypoxia
  inducible factor 1 subunit alpha; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase; KLF2, Kruppel‐like
  factor 2; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; P70S6K, p70 ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinase; RANK, receptor activation of
  NF‐κB; TET2, ten‐eleven translocation 2; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated
  factor 6; ULK1, Unc‐51‐like kinase 1.'
