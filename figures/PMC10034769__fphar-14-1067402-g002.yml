caption: 'Role of Urolithin A (UA) in LPS-mediated ALI in BEAS-2B cells and mice.
  (A) H&E staining images of Lung tissue. (B) Lung W/D weight ratio. (C,D) Neutrophil
  number and protein content of the BALF. (E–G) TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expressions
  in mouse BALF were measured by ELISA assay. (H–J) TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression
  in BEAS-2B cells culture supernatant treated with LPS(10 ug/mL) were analyzed through
  ELISA assay. The results were shown as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01, **p < 0.01 in comparison
  to control and LPS groups, respectively.'
