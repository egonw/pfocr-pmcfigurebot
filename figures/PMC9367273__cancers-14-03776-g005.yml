caption: Exosomes from HCC827 cell line activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
  (A) Phosphokinase antibody array blots using lysates of A549 treated with 50 µg
  of exosomes isolated from HCC827 supernatant. Circled spots indicated positive signal
  for ❶ AKT (S473) and ❷. TOR (S2448) (B) Quantification of the relative levels of
  the phosphorylation of indicated kinases.
