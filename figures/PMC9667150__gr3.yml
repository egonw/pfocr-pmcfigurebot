caption: 'Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. (A) Illustrative pathway diagram depicting the perturbed mitochondrial ETC
  and TCA cycle in the right cerebral cortex metabolome following ICV polymyxin B
  treatment. Attenuated metabolites are highlighted by blue rectangles. (B) Bar charts
  depicting the significantly perturbed metabolites involved in the mitochondrial
  ETC and TCA cycle in response to ICV polymyxin B treatment (log2FC ≥−1.5; p < 0.05).
  2-OG = 2-oxoglutarate. Blue rectangle: attenuated metabolites. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)'
