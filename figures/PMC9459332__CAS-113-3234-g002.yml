caption: The difference in salivary metabolites between healthy controls (HC) and
  colorectal cancer (CRC). (A), Score plots of partial least squares discriminant
  analysis (PLS‐DA). x‐ and y‐axes indicate the first and the second PLS component.
  Each plot corresponds to one sample. The plots with shorter distances indicate high
  similarity of the metabolomics profile of these samples. (B), Variable importance
  projection (VIP) score of PLS‐DA. (C), Pathway analysis. The metabolite concentration
  of each sample was divided by its median value. Subsequently, the data were log2‐transformed
  and translated into Z‐scores. For PLS‐DA, the 10‐fold cross‐validation with five
  components showed the highest generalization value (R 2 = 0.552 and Q 2 = 0.524)
