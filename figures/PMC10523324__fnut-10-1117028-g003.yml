caption: Sevoflurane exposure increased the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines
  and activated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway of the PFC in aged STC mice. (A–H)
  Statistical analysis of the concentrations of IL-2 (A, F3,16 = 4.16, p = 0.02),
  IL-4 (B, F3,16 = 1.00, p = 0.42), IL-1 (C, F3,16 = 5.77, p < 0.01), IL-5 (D, F3,16
  = 5.48, p < 0.01), IL-10 (E, F3,16 = 5.42, p = 0.01), INF-γ (F, F3,16 = 6.28, p
  < 0.01), TNF-α (G, F3,16 = 7.58, p < 0.01), and GM-CSF (H, F3,16 = 3.96, p = 0.03)
  at 4 h after sevoflurane anesthesia. (I) Representative western blot bands for TLR4
  and GAPDH proteins. (J) Representative western blot bands for active-NF-κB, NF-κB,
  and GAPDH proteins. (K) Quantitative analysis of the expression of TLR4 at 24 h
  after sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 6, F3,16 = 13.37, p < 0.01). (L) Quantitative
  analysis of the relative expression of active-NF-κB/NF-κB at 24 h after sevoflurane
  anesthesia (n = 6, F3,16 = 7.04, p < 0.01). Data were presented as mean ± SD. One-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc comparison. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.
  CTRL, control; Sev, sevoflurane exposure; STC, slow transit constipation.
