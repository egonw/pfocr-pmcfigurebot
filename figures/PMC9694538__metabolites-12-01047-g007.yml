caption: The schematic regulation of TCA cycle-associated activity by DOX treatment
  in HCT116 cancer cells. Red- and green-colored metabolites were represented as increased
  and decreased in HCT116 cells, respectively. The red sign shows a possible metabolic
  chemical reaction inhibition in cancer cells. *, ** and *** represent p < 0.05,
  p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.
