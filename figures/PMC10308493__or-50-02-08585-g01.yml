caption: The MyD88 inhibitor, ST2825, induces the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  of PDAC cells. (A and B) Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle to determine
  the changes in the ratio of PANC-1 cells in the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases following
  treatment with ST2825. (C and D) Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle to determine
  the changes of the ratio of BxPC-3 cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases following
  treatment with ST2825. (E and F) Flow cytometric analysis in the Annexin V-FITC/PI
  apoptosis assay to determine the ratio of apoptotic PANC-1 cells following treatment
  with ST2825. (G and H) Flow cytometric analysis in the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis
  assay to determine the ratio of apoptotic BxPC-3 cells following treatment with
  ST2825. (I and J) Western blot analysis of the three groups of PANC-1/BxPC-3 cells
  as in panels A and C to determine the changes of expression of cell cycle-related
  proteins. (K and L) Western blot analysis of the three groups of PANC-1/BxPC-3 cells
  as in panels E and G to determine the changes in the expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. The t-test with the Bonferroni test was used for statistical analysis,
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; N.S., not significant. PDAC, pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NC, negative control;
  ST, ST2825.
