caption: The heterogeneity of HCs and SCs from P30 mouse utricle sensory epithelium.
  (A) UMAP clustering of HCs and SCs in the P30 mouse utricle sensory epithelium.
  Type I HCs, Type II HCs, and six different SC populations are labelled with different
  colours. (B) The proportions of different cell clusters in P30 utricle sensory epithelium
  illustrated by a pie chart. (C) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed genes
  in the P30 SC clusters. (D) Feature plots and violin plots showing the informative
  genes in each cluster. (E) Immunofluorescent staining of DAPI and Tectb in P30 mouse
  utricles. The striolar boundaries are labelled as dotted lines. (F1) The comparison
  of KEGG pathway annotation between different SC clusters. The top categories are
  shown. (F2) Gene ontology (GO) analyses of SC clusters at P30. GO subitems specifying
  the biological process (GO‐BP) are displayed. (G,H) Inference of potential cell–cell
  communication networks for P30 HC and SC datasets using CellChat. (G) Violin plot
  of signalling gene expression related to the most active signalling pathways according
  to CellChat. The inserted bar plot on the right shows the contribution of each ligand‐receptor
  pair to the overall effect of the PTN signalling pathway. (H) Chord diagrams divided
  by individual ligand‐receptor pairs were used for visualizing the cell–cell communication
  networks. Arrows point to potential signal recipient cells
