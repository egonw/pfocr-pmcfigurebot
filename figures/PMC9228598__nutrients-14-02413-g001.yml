caption: The effect of resveratrol (RSV) on cell viability in A549 and BEAS-2B cells.
  A549 cells (A) and BEAS-2B cells (B) were treated with RSV (0–200 μM) for 12 h (C),
  24 h (D), 48 h (E), and 72 h (F). Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay.
  The data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 compared with BEAS-2B group.
