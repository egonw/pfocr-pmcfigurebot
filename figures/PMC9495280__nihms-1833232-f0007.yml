figure_title: Model for regulation of KaiB association by KaiC phosphostate
caption: a, Cartoon depiction of the KaiB association pathway. Daytime (yellow) and
  nighttime (blue) states of KaiC both adopt an extended C6-symmetric ground state.
  During the day, the extended state is in equilibrium with an open state where the
  CII hexamer is destabilized relative to the CI domain. At night, excursions from
  the extended state result in a C2-symmetric hexamer where two subunits of the CII
  domain are compressed to prime KaiC for KaiB association. An initial KaiB binding
  event takes place through this compressed intermediate to pave the way for cooperative
  saturation of the CI hexamer with KaiB molecules. b, Schematic depiction of the
  regulatory conduit through which the CI and CII domains communicate to regulate
  KaiB association according to clock phase.
