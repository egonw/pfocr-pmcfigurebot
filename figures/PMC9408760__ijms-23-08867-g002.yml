caption: 'NX210c enhanced basal synaptic transmission in the brain. (A,B) Top panels:
  representative traces of extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials
  (fEPSPs). (A) Measurements of extracellular fEPSP slopes normalized to the baseline
  in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum after stimulation of Schaffer collaterals
  and commissural pathway in the absence and presence of NX210c at 250 µg/mL. (B)
  Measurements of fEPSP slopes normalized to the baseline in the somatosensory cortex
  after stimulation of the ventroposteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus in the absence
  and presence of NX210c at 250 µg/mL. (A,B) Repeated-measures two-way ANOVA followed
  by Šidák’s multiple comparisons test: ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 compared with baseline;
  n = 10 slices from 5 mice (i.e., 2 slices per mouse).'
