caption: Combining radiation therapy with PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors increases
  radiosensitivity. (A) Results of clonogenic assays. A549 and LLC1 were treated with
  PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors (GDC0941 0.1 μM, GDC0032 0.1 μM, CAL101 1 μM,
  IPI145 1 μM) 3 h after irradiation of 2 Gy. (B) Activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway in A549 and LLC1 cells. (C) Representative immunofluorescence images of
  the γ-H2AX expression in A549 and LLC1 cells after the combination therapy. A P-value
  <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001
