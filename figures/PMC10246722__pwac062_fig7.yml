caption: HIF-1α activator DMOG induces hair growth in vivo. (A) The schematic illustration
  showing DMOG increased HIF-1α stabilization and activated the target genes through
  inhibiting Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD). (B) Western blot analysis of HIF-1 α in pMVECs
  treated with DMOG. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test
  was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. (C) Left, representative hair
  coats of vehicle- or DMOG-treated mice on day 27 post-treatment. Right, quantification
  for the appearance of melanin pigmentation in mouse skin treated with DMOG versus
  vehicle. Pigmentation scoring is described in Materials and methods. Vehicle, n
  = 14; DMOG, n = 17. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented
  as the mean ± SEMs. (D) Volcano plot showing the expression patterns DEGs of mouse
  skin treated with DMOG versus vehicle. (E) Heatmap showing the relative expression
  level (row-scaling) of DEGs (left) and representative GO terms and pathways (right)
  for upregulated and downregulated DEGs in mouse skin treated with DMOG versus vehicle.
  (F) GSEA showing HIF-1 signaling pathway (top) and blood vessel morphogenesis (bottom)
  enriched in mouse skin treated with vehicle or DMOG. NES, normalized enrichment
  score; FDR, false discovery rate. (G) Immunofluorescence staining of VWF in skin
  tissues on day 27 post-treatment with vehicle or DMOG. Right, the quantitative data
  of VWF-positive area in the skin. Vehicle, n = 8; DMOG, n = 8. Two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bar,
  100 μm. (H) Immunofluorescence staining of Ki67 in HFs on day 27 post-treatment
  with vehicle or DMOG. Right, the quantitative data of Ki67-positive cells per HF.
  Vehicle, n = 6; DMOG, n = 6 and 15 HFs were calculated for each individual. Two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale
  bars, 50 μm. (I) H&E staining of skin tissues sections on day 27 post-treatment
  with vehicle or DMOG (left) and the quantitative data of the percentage of anagen
  HFs and the relative HF length in skin tissue (right). Vehicle, n = 6; DMOG, n =
  6. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean
  ± SEMs. Scale bars, 200 μm. (J) A schematic illustration showing the phenotypical
  and molecular changes during the hair regrowth upon Que treatment.
