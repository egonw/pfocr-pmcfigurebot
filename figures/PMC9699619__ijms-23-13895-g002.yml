caption: 'Interactions between RAAS, NO, and H2S. The RAAS consists of two main axes,
  the pro-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive ACE-Ang II pathway, and the anti-inflammatory,
  vasorelaxant ACE2-Ang-(1-7) pathway, both of which differently affect NO and H2S
  bioavailability. Ang II uses AT1R and AT2R to exert a variety of effects upon NO
  bioavailability; there are reports of Ang II increasing NOS activity while simultaneously
  increasing the production of ROS through NADPH oxidase, resulting in NOS uncoupling
  and a net decrease in NO bioavailability over time despite increased production
  and release. Ang II also inhibits sGC and increases the activity of some PDEs, diminishing
  the function of the NO signaling pathway. On the other hand, Ang-(1-7) augments
  NO bioavailability both by reducing ROS and by stimulating NOS activity. In return,
  NO downregulates ACE and AT1R, reducing RAAS activation. There are also reports
  of the RAAS affecting H2S bioavailability, where increasing Ang II decreased H2S
  bioavailability by downregulating CSE and CBS. Measures to increase H2S bioavailability
  reduce traditional RAAS activation, inhibiting or downregulating renin release,
  ACE, AT1R, and ROS levels while increasing ACE2 activity to increase the function
  of the anti-inflammatory axis of the RAAS. Both gasotransmitters also interact to
  reinforce the other’s increase in bioavailability. Thus, NO and H2S both act to
  reduce RAAS overactivation, serving as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasorelaxant
  mediators. Note: black arrows show effects of RAAS on NO and H2S, green arrows show
  effects of the gasotransmitters on components of RAAS. Abbreviations: ACE, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Ang, angiotensin; AT1R, angiotensin
  II type 1 receptor; AT2R, angiotensin II type 2 receptor; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase;
  CSE, Cystathionine γ-Lyase; H2S, hydrogen sulfide; NADPH oxidase, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; NEP, neutral endopeptidase; NO, nitric oxide; NOS,
  nitric oxide synthase; PDEs, phosphodiesterases; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system; ROS, reactive oxygen species; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.'
