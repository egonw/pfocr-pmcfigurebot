caption: 'Combined treatment effect on sSCC cell lines relating to PDT pathway. (A)
  PpIX production was evaluated by flow cytometry after incubation with metformin
  (24 h, 75 μM), MAL (5 h, 0.3 mM), and metformin plus MAL (24 h followed by 5 h,
  respectively). (B) ROS generation was evaluated by flow cytometry after incubation
  with metformin (24 h, 75 μM), MAL (5 h, 0.3 mM), PDT (MAL following red light −23 J/cm2
  in SCC13 and 7 J/cm2 in A431-) and combined treatment (metformin plus PDT).Values
  were represented as mean ± SD (∗: p< 0.05; ∗∗: p< 0.01; ∗∗∗: p< 0.001) (n = 3).'
