caption: 'Effect of XFBD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory cytokines
  in RAW264.7 cells. (A) XFBD cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 cells was determined by the
  CCK-8 assay. (B–F) Nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor
  alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in RAW264.7 cells.
  Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD) by one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA). n = 4. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs
  LPS group, ∧∧p < 0.01 vs administration group (50 μg/mL), ††p < 0.01 vs administration
  group (100 μg/mL).'
