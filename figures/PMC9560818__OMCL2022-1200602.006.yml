caption: 'Knockdown of PCAF ameliorated vascular senescence. (a) The concentration
  of IL-1β in the plasma from ctrl (n = 6), aged+AAV9-Luc (n = 8), and aged+AAV9-PCAF
  (n = 7) mice were determined by ELISA kit according to its instruction. (b) and
  (c) Representative SaβG staining of aortic sinus sections (b) and its qualification
  analysis and thoracoabdominal aorta (i). Scale bars, 20 μm. (d) and (e): The expression
  of senescence-associated markers (d) and inflammatory factors (e) in the aorta from
  each group were assessed by immunoblotting. (f) The expression of YAP and p-YAP
  were investigated by immunoblotting. (g) and (h) The expression of p16, p21 (g)
  and p-YAP (h) were detected by IHC. Scale bars, 20 μm. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n.s. P > 0.05).'
