caption: Effect of the treatment with 4-HB analogs in the cerebral and renal metabolism
  of Coq9R239X mice.(A) Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores plots for the
  metabolites modified by the mutation and normalized by β-RA and VA treatments in
  the brain. The right heatmap indicates the metabolite levels for each experimental
  group.(B-E) Key metabolites related to amino acid metabolism (B), purine metabolism
  (C), hexosamines biosynthetic pathway (D) and glutathione metabolism (E) detected
  in the brain of Coq9+/+ mice, Coq9R239X mice, Coq9R239X mice after 1% β-RA treatment
  and Coq9R239X mice after 1% VA treatment at 3 months of age.(F) Variable importance
  in projection (VIP) scores plots for the metabolites modified by the mutation and
  normalized by β-RA and VA treatments in the kidneys. The right heatmap indicates
  the metabolite levels for each experimental group.(G-M) Key metabolites related
  to amino acids metabolism (G), purine metabolism (H), glutathione metabolism (I),
  hexosamines biosynthetic pathway (J), glycolysis/pentose phosphate pathway (K),
  carnitines (L) and vitamins (M) detected in the kidneys of Coq9+/+ mice, Coq9R239X
  mice, Coq9R239X mice after 1% β-RA treatment and Coq9R239X mice after 1% VA treatment
  at 3 months of age.Data are expressed as average peak area ±SD compared to wild-type.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, differences versus Coq9+/+; +P < 0.05, ++P < 0.01,
  +++P < 0.001, versus Coq9R239X; (one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc test; n = 5
  for each group).
