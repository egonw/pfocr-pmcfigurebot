caption: Enrichment analysis of HSP90B1. (a) We first obtained 50 proteins that could
  interact with HSP90B1 using the STRING tool. (b) Additionally, 100 genes with a
  high correlation with HSP90B1 were obtained from the TCGA database, and the expression
  correlation between HSP90B1 and selected targeted genes (including HSPA5, PDIA3,
  MANF, PDIA4, CALR, and PDIA6) was analysed. (c) We analysed the relationship between
  these six genes and the incidence of each cancer. (d) We conducted a crossover analysis
  of 100 genes with a high correlation with HSP90B1 and 50 genes that could interact
  with HSP90B1. Enrichment analysis based on HSP90B1 with high correlation and interaction
  was performed using KEGG (e) and GO (f) pathway analyses.
