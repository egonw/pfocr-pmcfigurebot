  systematic for identification of the specific antimicrobial candidate for C. acnes.
  (B) Classification of essential genes in various metabolic subsystems based on their
  functional roles. (C) Tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic pathway related to highly unique
  genes. The metabolic reactions inhibited by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were indicated
  with an asterisk (*).
