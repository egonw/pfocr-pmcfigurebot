caption: 'Treatment with blueberry fraction 7 (BBFr7) inhibits cell proliferation
  through suppression of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HTLV‐1‐infected and adult
  T‐cell leukemia (ATL) cells. A, Cell viability and IC50 were determined by CCK‐8
  after treatment with 0‐20 μg/ml BBFr7 for 72 h in T‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
  HTLV‐1‐infected, and ATL cell lines. B, Cell viability was determined by CCK‐8 after
  treatment with 20 μg/ml ApplePhenon and oligonol (OLG‐F) for 72 h in MT2 cells.
  Mean and SD are shown (n = 4). *p < 0.05 compared with control; #p < 0.05 compared
  with BBFr7. C, Expression and phosphorylation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
  in MT2 and SO4 cells after treatment with the indicated doses of BBFr7 for 24 h
  were determined by immunoblot analysis using each specific Ab. D, Cell apoptosis
  under the same experimental conditions as in (C) was determined by immunoblot assay
  using anticaspase 3 or anticleaved caspase 3 Abs. E, Quantitative RT‐PCR analysis
  of JAK/STAT target mRNAs after treatment with 2 μg/ml BBFr7 for 24 h in MT2 and
  SO4 cells. Mean and SD are shown (n = 3). *p < 0.05 compared with (−). F, Cell viability
  and IC50 were determined by CCK‐8 after treatment with 0–20 μg/ml BBFr7 at 72 h
  in PBMCs, ATL patients, and HTLV‐1‐associated myelopathy (HAM) cells. G, Expression
  and phosphorylation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in ATL patients and HAM cells
  after treatment with indicated doses of BBFr7 for 24 h were determined by immunoblot
  analysis using specific Abs. H, Cell apoptosis under the same experimental conditions
  as in (G) was determined by immunoblot assay using anticaspase‐3 or anticleaved
  caspase‐3 Abs. I, Quantitative RT‐PCR analysis of JAK/STAT mRNA was carried out
  after treatment with 2 μg/ml BBFr7 for 24 h in MT2 and SO4 cells. Mean and SD are
  shown (n = 3)'
