caption: 'APOL1 overexpression can induce pyroptosis in fibroblasts. This part was
  divided into four groups, Blank control group, Negative control group (empty plasmid
  group), LPS+ATP group, LPS+ATP+OE (overexpression plasmid) group, respectively.
  LPS+ATP were used to induce cell pyroptosis, and APOL1 gene overexpression plasmid
  was constructed. (A and B) Fibroblasts were induced to pyroptosis, then the morphological
  changes in cells (A) LDH release (B). Scale bars: 200 mm. Yellow arrows, pyroptotic
  bubbles. (C) Fibroblasts were stained with PI (100 µL/well). (D) The protein expression
  was detected by Western blot. (E) Relative protein expression of GAPDH adjusted.
  (F) The mRNA levels of infammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, HMGB1,
  and IL-6 were detected by RT-PCR. (G) The mRNA levels of chemokines including CXCL1,
  CXCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were detected by RT-PCR. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  and ****p<0.0001.'
