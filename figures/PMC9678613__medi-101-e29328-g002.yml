caption: Effect of baicalin treatment on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 μM of baicalin for 24 h. Cells were suspended
  and reseeded into a Transwell chamber for 16 h. The migrated cells were stained
  with 0.01% crystal violet. (A) The cells were observed with an inverted microscope
  (× 100 magnifications) and images of the same were captured. (B) The numbers of
  migrated cells were counted. The cell viability of untreated cells was set as 100%.
  Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation, *P < .05 vs untreated cells.
