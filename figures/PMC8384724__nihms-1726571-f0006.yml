caption: Advanced delivery platforms and delivery mechanisms of nanoparticulate anti-GBM
  drugs. Nanocarriers have been proposed based on various materials and principles
  as shown in the figure (a-g). Ligand-installed nanocarriers achieve therapeutic
  effects by actively targeting the surface marker or signaling pathway of cancer
  cells. Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers can release drug by responding to internal/external
  stimuli, which enable specific delivery cargos into the tumor microenvironment.
