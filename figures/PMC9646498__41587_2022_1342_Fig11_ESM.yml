figure_title: TmS is associated with tumor genomic features and metabolic pathway
  activities across cancer types
caption: a, Contributors to tumor-specific total mRNA expression. b, Distributions
  of TmS for TCGA samples with or without specific mutations in six cancer-gene pairs.
  The number of samples is indicated on the top. We performed an agnostic association
  analysis of TmS with all non-synonymous mutations (32,894 cancer-gene pairs, using
  logistic regression models), and concurrently a driver mutation-specific association
  analysis of TmS (24 cancer-gene pairs). We find 5 overlapping pairs out of 6 statistically
  significant pairs produced from each interrogation (BH adjusted P values < 0.01).
  The additional pair found through the agnostic search (FGFR3 in bladder carcinoma
  in TCGA) was not identified in the driver mutation analysis due to a limited sample
  size. These associations in breast, lung, thyroid, and bladder cancers show that
  TmS can capture changes in tumor phenotypes induced by driver mutations in a cancer
  type-specific manner. Our observation also supports previous findings that the same
  driver mutations may not have the same prognostic effect across cancers, and their
  effects may be modified by additional tumor and/or treatment-related factors. c-e,
  Distribution of TmS for patient samples with (c) high or low tumor mutation burden
  (TMB); (d) high or low chromosomal instability score; (e) with or without a whole
  genome duplication event. Patient groups are categorized as high vs. low based on
  the median values of TMB and chromosomal instability scores in (c) and (d) respectively.
  f, Heatmap of normalized enrichment scores (NES) of Reactome metabolism of carbohydrates
  pathways across 15 cancer types in TCGA. Pathways are ordered by the mean NES across
  15 cancer types, from high to low. g, Distribution of TmS for patient samples with
  high or low for pentose phosphate pathway activity, where patient groups are defined
  by hierarchical clustering of expression levels from 13 genes. For b-d and g, the
  BH adjusted P values for two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests comparing TmS between
  corresponding groups are indicated by asterisks (* P < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001).
