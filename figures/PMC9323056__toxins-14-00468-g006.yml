caption: 'Transcriptomics analysis after TobradexÂ® treatment. (A) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of BV vs BT. (B) Volcano plot of BV vs BT. Blue dots represent downregulated
  genes; gray dots represent genes with no significant difference; red dots represent
  upregulated genes. (C) Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of metabolic genes. Data
  show fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Red:
  upregulated expression, Purple: downregulated expression. (D) Functional enrichment
  analysis of BV vs BT. Biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular
  functions (MF), Log2 FC > 1, FDR < 0.01. (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) signaling pathway categories. (F) Enrichment analysis of the top 20 pathways
  of upregulated differential gene KEGG pathways in BV vs BT. p values less than 0.01
  after adjustment confer the most significance. (G) KEGG string diagram of the top
  five enriched signaling pathways. Colored lines show genes linked to the indicated
  pathways. Sorting is based on observed log2 FC values. Adjacent red boxes show decreasing
  intensity.'
