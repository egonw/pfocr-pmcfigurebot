caption: Immunofluorescence analysis of phospho-STAT proteins in MG-63 cells cultivated
  on discs (T and Z) or cover glasses for 72 h. (A) Phospho-STAT1 staining. The MG-63
  cells were untreated (left panel) or treated with IFN-α (middle panel) or IFN-γ
  (right panel). Untreated and IFN-α/IFN-γ-treated cells were stained with anti-phospho-STAT1
  and anti-vinculin antibodies. When the MG-63 cells were stimulated with IFN-α or
  IFN-γ, an intense nuclear immunostaining of phospho-STAT1 was observed (middle and
  right panels). The cytoplasm vinculin staining is shown in green. (B) Phospho-STAT3
  staining. The MG-63 cells were untreated (left panel) or treated with IFN-α (middle
  panel) or IL-6 (right panel). All cells were incubated with anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies
  (red) and anti-vinculin (green). In MG-63 cells stimulated with IFN-α or IL-6 an
  intense nuclear immunostaining of phospho-STAT3 was observed (right panel). (C)
  Phospho-STAT6 staining. The MG-63 cells were left untreated or treated with IL-4
  (right panel). The cells were incubated with anti-phospho-STAT6 (red) and anti-vinculin
  (green) antibodies. In MG-63 cells stimulated with IL-4, an intense nuclear immunostaining
  of phospho-STAT6 was observed (right panel). In all images magnification 40×, scale
  bar—50 nm.
