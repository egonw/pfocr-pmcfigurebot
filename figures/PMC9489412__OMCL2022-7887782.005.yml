caption: 'A subpopulation analysis of T cell populations. (a) UMAP analysis of T cell
  group subsets. (b) UMAP plot of T cell population of healthy and diseased tendon
  tissue samples. Left: T cell subpopulation in healthy tendon cells; right: T cell
  subpopulation in disease tendon cells. (c) Marker gene expression and distribution
  in the T cell subgroup. (d) Distribution of T cell subgroup in samples. (e) The
  GO enrichment analysis. (f) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (g) T cell subgroup
  ligand-receptor interaction network diagram. The size of the outer circle color
  indicates the number of cells; the cells emitting the arrow indicate the ligand
  and the cells pointing to the receptor. (h) The global communication pattern and
  the main signal between the subgroups. Color transition from blue to yellow indicates
  greater cell populations or major signal contribution. (i, j) Outgoing communication
  pattern recognition of secreted cells. (i) River plot. (j) Dot plot. The bubble
  size indicates the signal contribution.'
