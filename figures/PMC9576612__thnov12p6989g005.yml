caption: 'CHI3L1 reprogrammed the TME to an immunosuppressive phenotype in glioma.
  (A-B) Heatmap and violin plot showed the immune cells infiltration in glioma in
  TCGA. (C-D) Total macrophages and lymphocytes comparison between normal and glioma
  tissues in TCGA, Wilcoxon test. (E) Spearman correlation analysis between the CHI3L1
  expression and immune cells infiltration in TCGA. (F) The immune score, estimate
  score, stromal score, tumor purity, TIS score, dysfunction, exclusion and TIDE score
  between the CHI3L1high and CHI3L1low groups of patients with glioma in TCGA, Wilcoxon
  test. (G-J) Spearman correlation analysis between the expression of CHI3L1 and immune
  checkpoints in glioma, as well as in MES glioma in TCGA. (H) tstudent (163) = 7.09,
  rPearson = 0.49, CI95% [0.36, 0.59], npairs = 165. loge (BF01) = -19.44, = 0.48,  =

  of CHI3L1 and immune checkpoints in glioma, as well as in MES glioma in CGGA. (L)
