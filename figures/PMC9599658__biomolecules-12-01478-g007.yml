caption: Cell-cell ligand-receptor network analysis. (A) Intercellular interactions
  across microenvironment cells in TNBC. (B) Circle plots displaying the inferred
  network of the TNF signaling pathway. The edge width is proportional to the inferred
  communication amount. (C) Heatmap showing the relative importance of each cell group
  based on the computed four network centrality measures of TNF signaling. (D) Bubble
  plot showing the ligand-receptor between malignant cells and fibroblasts, monocytes,
  TAMs, and pDCs. (E) Network showing the potential drugs for TNF-related L-R pairs.
