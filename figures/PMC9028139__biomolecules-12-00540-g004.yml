caption: Erythroid differentiation. (a) Glycophorin A (GPA) and Transferrin receptor
  expression on erythroid cells obtained at Day 4 and Day 8 of culture of non-transduced
  CD34+ cells in presence or absence of Notch γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT as well as
  transduced CD34+ cells with shHIF1α or with shHIF2α at 20 and 3% O2. The bars show
  the average percentage of GPA+/CD71+ cells. (b) The average value of total number
  of GPA+/CD71+ cells in 4-day culture. Data are presented as mean ± SD of seven independent
  experiments. The asterisks indicate a significant difference with respect to NT
  condition at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.001 (***); the hashtags indicate a significant
  difference with respect to 20% O2 condition at p < 0.01 (##), Mann–Whitney test.
  NT, non-transduced CD34+ cells; D, day of culture.
