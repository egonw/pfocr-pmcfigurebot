figure_title: Mechanism of mDAAO-dependent H2S generation and detection in response
  to D-cysteine
caption: (A) This left hand portion of this schematic represents the simplified biochemical
  pathway for the oxidation of D-Cysteine by mDAAO to 3-mercaptopyruvate, leading
  to formation of H2S.The right hand portion of the schematic shows reduction of the
  genetically encoded hsGFP biosensor upon its interaction with H2S. (B) The left
  panel shows representative real-time traces of chemogenetically-produced H2S in
  response to 1 mM D-Alanine, D-Methionine, and D-Cysteine, respectively, in HEK293
  cells co-expressing untargeted hsGFP and mCherry-mDAAO-NLS. The bar graph shows
  statistical analysis of the maximum response of hsGFP in response to 1 mM D-Alanine
  (n=27, white bar), 1 mM D-Methionine (n=27, black bar), 1 mM D-Cysteine (n=27, yellow
  bar). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test were applied
  to compare all columns with each other, p < 0.0001 P-value summary ***. All values
  are given as ±SD.
