caption: Effect of AMPK activator co-treatment in neonatal rats. (A) Body weight and
  BAT/body weight ratio, Con, n = 3; Con+AICAR, n = 3; Dex, n = 4; Dex+AICAR, n =
  4. (B) Gross appearance and H&E stain of interscapular BAT, Con, n = 5; Con+AICAR,
  n = 6; Dex, n = 6; Dex+AICAR, n = 7. Scale bar = 200 μm. Immunoblot analysis on
  (C) UCP1 protein and AMPK signaling pathway and (D) fission proteins and autophagy-related
  proteins after co-treatment with AICAR. (E) Infrared thermo-imaging at 1 h after
  the beginning of cold challenge and (F) back skin temperature during cold challenge
  (12 °C). (G) Survival curves of neonatal rats after cold challenge. Con, n = 6;
  Con+AICAR, n = 5; Dex, n = 5; Dex+AICAR, n = 5. (H) Electron microscope images.
  Scale bar = 10 μm in upper panels and 1 μm in lower panels. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SEM and statistics were calculated by one-way ANOVA. For quantification
  of immunoblot analysis, the intensities of bands quantified densitometrically relative
  to the control were expressed as the bar graph with statistics analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA in (C and D). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
