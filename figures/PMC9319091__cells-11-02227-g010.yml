caption: 'miR-124a regulates myoblast autophagy via the transient receptor potential
  of the VMP1/ULK1 pathway: (A) An adenovirus harboring tandem fluorescent mRFP-GFP-LC3
  was used to evaluate the extent of autophagic flux after overexpression or inhibition
  of miR-124a. (B,D) Mean numbers of GFP and mRFP puncta per cell; three cells were
  randomly selected from each field to be counted. (C,E) Mean numbers of autophagosomes
  and autolysosomes per cell. Autophagosomes have green and red puncta, while in the
  merged images the puncta appear yellow. Autolysosomes have red puncta only. (F,G)
  Protein levels of ULK1/mTOR were detected after overexpression or inhibition of
  miR-124a. GAPDH was used as an internal standard. Replicates = 3. Data are presented
  as the mean Â± SE; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.'
