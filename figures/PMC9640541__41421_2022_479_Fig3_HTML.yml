figure_title: Proteomic subtyping of MTC and their clinical, genomic and epigenomic
  Correlations
caption: 'a Unsupervised clustering based on the relative abundance of 891 proteins
  identifies three MTC subtypes: Metabolic (n = 33), Basal (n = 36), and Mesenchymal
  (n = 33). Clinicopathologic characteristics, prognostic features and driver mutations
  are annotated above the heatmap with details shown at the bottom. Each column represents
  a patient sample and rows indicate proteins. Protein abundances were displayed in
  this heatmap after normalization by row Z-score. b Pathway-level analysis of each
  proteomic subtype shows relative pathway activity (represented as t-value) of cancer
  hallmark gene sets derived from gene set variation analysis (GSVA). Benjamini–Hochberg
  FDR values are annotated as follows: ***FDR < 0.001, **FDR < 0.01, *FDR < 0.05.
  c Differential protein abundance of basal factors and eukaryotic initiation factor
  (EIF) complex members across the three proteomic clusters. The horizontal bars represent
  the log2-transformed FC value of protein abundance between Basal tumors and the
  other samples. The length of horizontal bars represents the size of log2FC (a longer
  bar corresponds to a larger log2FC), while the color scale of the heatmap represents
  the expression of these proteins in the three subtypes (a deeper color represents
  a higher protein abundance), which was calculated using the Z-score-transformed
  average protein abundance within each subtype. d Abundance of signature protein
  families (including collagens, laminins, thrombospondins, integrins, fibronectins
  and others) involved in the KEGG pathway ECM–Receptor Interaction across the three
  proteomic subtypes. The value of each protein was calculated using the Z-score-transformed
  average protein abundance within each subtype. e Bar plots showing the proportion
  of three proteomic subtypes in RETM918T-mutant, RETC634-mutant and RAS-mutant tumors.
  P-values are calculated with Fisher’s exact test, *P < 0.05. f Frequency of SCNA
  in the three proteomic subtypes. Representative subtype-specific SCNAs and contained
  genes whose SCNA-revealed cis-effect on their cognate proteins were annotated. g
  Histograms comparing the global DNA methylation level of CpG island (left panel)
  and CpG shore (right panel) regions between proteomic subtypes. Height of the column
  represents the mean value of DNA methylation level of all samples in the corresponding
  proteomic subtype, and the error bar represents the 95% confidence interval. P-values
  are calculated with Student’s t-test. h Representative enriched pathways based on
  genes overlapping with CNA gain (red) or loss (blue) regions in each proteomic subtype.
  i Dot plots visualizing representative enriched KEGG pathways based on cognate genes
  of differentially methylated sites in each proteomic subtype. j Bar plots comparing
  the proportion of patients with TNM staging (left panel) and BcR/BcPD (right panel)
  between proteomic subtypes. P-values are calculated with Pearson’s χ2 test. k Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves for SRFS of the three proteomic subtypes. See also Supplementary
