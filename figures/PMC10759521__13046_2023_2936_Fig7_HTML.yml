caption: DCAF13 knockdown inhibits the LUAD cell growth in vivo. (A) A549 shDCAF13
  or shControl cells were implanted into BALB/C nude mice by subcutaneous injection.
  Photograph was shown as the xenograft tumor with shControl or shDCAF13 A549 cells.
  Tumors were separated after 5 weeks. (B) Mean tumor weights in mice. (C) Xenograft
  tumor growth curves in mice. (D) The mRNA expression of DCAF13, TP53, CDKN1A, and
  BAX in mouse tissues were detected by qPCR. (E) The protein expression of DCAF13
  and p53 in mouse tissues were detected by western blot analysis. Data were statistically
  analyzed using Student’s t-test and values are shown as mean ± SD. **** p < 0.0001.
  (F) The protein expression of DCAF13, p53, p21, BAX, FAS, BBC3 and Ki67 in mouse
  tumor tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry assay. Representative images
  are shown, scale bar = 50 μm
