caption: 'APP and its cleavage product expression in pre-symptomatic APP/PS1 mouse
  retina. (A) Representative western blot images of APP expression (apparent Mw =
  98 kDa), as revealed with 6E10 antibody directed against the human APP transgene
  and quantified after normalization over β-actin, used as a loading control. (A’)
  Relative quantification of APP expression (WT n = 6: 3M+3F; TG = 5: 3M+2F) for 3–4
  months) and (A’’) WT n = 6: 3M+3F); TG = 4: 2M+2F for 9 months). (B) Representative
  western blot images of βCTF expression (apparent Mw = 14 kDa), as revealed with
  CT20 antibody directed against the cleavage products of human APP. (B’) relevant
  quantification (WT n = 4: 3M+1F; TG = 5: 3M+2F for 3–4 months) and (B’’) WT n =
  5: 3M+2F; TG = 5: 3M+2F for 9 months). (C) Aβ expression was quantified by ELISA
  against human Aβ1-40 (WT n = 3: 2M+1F and TG n = 8 6M+2F p = 0.004) with all mice
  aged 12 months and Aβ1-42 proteins (WT n = 3: 2M+1F and TG n = 8: 6M+2F; p = 0,01)
  with all mice aged 12 months. (D) ELISA quantification of βCTF (WT n = 4: 2M+2F;
  TG = 3: 2M+1F for 3–4 months and WT n = 3: 2M+1F; TG = 4: 2M+1F for 9 m and 1F for
  12mo). WT = non-transgenic, wild-type; TG = transgenic APP/PS1. * p < 0.05; ** p
  < 0.01.'
