caption: 'ICAT promotes cellular migration and invasion in vitro. (A) Levels of ICAT
  protein and mRNA expression were evaluated using Western blotting and real‐time
  RT‐PCR, respectively, in CRC cells overexpressing ICAT. (B and C) Wound healing
  assay was performed in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines overexpressing ICAT and the control
  cell line, respectively. Representative images (left; scale bars: 100 μm) and quantitation
  for the extent of wound healing (right). (D and E) A transwell assay (left; scale
  bars: 100 μm) shows the migration and invasion of the indicated cells. The number
  of migrated cells (right) groups were enumerated by ImageJ software. **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001'
