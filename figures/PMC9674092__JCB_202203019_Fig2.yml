caption: MtDNA depletion in astrocytes purified from TwKOastro mice induces motile
  ciliogenesis program. (Aâ€“F) RNA sequencing, astrocytes purified from TwKOastro compared
  to control mice. The dataset is described in . (A) Gene ontology pathway enrichment
  analysis of upregulated genes in astrocytes of TwKOastro mice. Pathways involved
  in cilia motility are marked in red. (B) Genes expressing ciliary proteins in astrocytes
  of TwKOastro mice (SysCilia Gold Standard gene list []). See also  and . (C) Motif
  enrichment analysis of promoters of upregulated genes in TwKOastro astrocytes reveals
  RFX consensus motif (RFX3 motif enrichment is shown here, see also ). (D) Distribution
  graphs of the TF-binding sites proximal to the promoters of upregulated genes (ChIP-seq
  data from ). X-axis represents distance from TSS (transcription starting site),
  which equals point zero. Randomly selected gene sets either from the whole mouse
  genome or genes expressed in astrocytes, but not changed in our dataset, constitute
  negative gene sets. See also . (E) Transcription factors that regulate ciliogenesis
  in the brain; mRNA levels in TwKOastro astrocytes. (F) Key steps of multiciliated
  cell differentiation, from cell cycle exit to motile cilia formation; schematic
  representation (left). The expression of the key regulators of cilia biogenesis
  in astrocytes of TwKOastro mice. (G) Foxj1 expression in purified astrocytes (ACSA-2+
  fraction) compared to unsorted cell suspension; RT-qPCR, normalized to Ywhaz transcript
  level. Symbols represent individual preparations (n = 5 per genotype). P values
  calculated using unpaired two-tailed parametric t test. (H) Foxj1 expression; RNA-fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, 3.5-mo-old mice, images are representative of 3-4 mice per
  genotype. Dashed lines indicate the ependymal cell layer. Puncta specific for Foxj1
  channel were analyzed (arrows). Puncta that overlap with autofluorescence or ARL13B
  signal (arrowhead) were excluded as non-specific signal. Mice also express AAV-gfaABC1D-Arl13b-eGFP
  to visualize cilia. See also .
