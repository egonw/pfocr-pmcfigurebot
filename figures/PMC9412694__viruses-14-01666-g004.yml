caption: 'The impact of epitranscriptomic methylations on IFN-I response during HCV
  and Enterovirus infection. (Left side) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome carries a
  cap structure (m7G and 2′-O methylations at its 5′ end, filled blue and green circles,
  respectively), added by its own methyltransferase, NS5 (not shown), and is important
  to evade MDA5 sensing. M6A methylations (filled purple circles) of the HCV genome
  interact with the YTHDF2 (F2, light blue) protein and avoid RIG-I sensing. HCV infection
  also increases the m6A methylation levels of RIOK3 and PTEN transcripts. The increase
  in m6A methylations of RIOK3 increases its translation through YTHDF1 interaction
  and reduces HCV replication efficiency. RIOK3 has a dual effect on the RLR-mediated
  antiviral signaling pathway: it phosphorylates MDA5 or induces RIG-I and MDA5 degradation,
  thereby inhibiting their activation on one hand, and acting as an adaptor protein
  for IRF3 phosphorylation, thereby promoting further signaling on the other hand.
  On the contrary, the increase in m6A methylations of PTEN induces mRNA decay, and
  hence lowers PTEN protein levels, which results in lower IRF3 nuclear translocation.
  (Right side) M6A methylations also present in Enterovirus genome. In the early stages
  of infection, 2Apro viral protease cleaves YTHDF1-2-3 (F1, F2, and F3, respectively,
  light blue) reader proteins. The YTHDF3 protein has a positive regulatory effect
  on innate immunity by enhancing JAK/STAT signaling, and thus ISG production (not
  shown). F1: YTHDF1; F2: YTHDF2; F3: YTHDF3; M3: METTL3; M14: METTL14.'
