figure_title: Rptor depletion leads to estrogen unresponsiveness of the vagina
caption: 'A, B Immunoblotting analysis of PR and ER protein levels in the vagina of
  control (n = 3) and Rptor cKO (n = 3) mice. β-Actin was used as the loading control.
  C Representative images of the immunofluorescence staining of PR in the vagina of
  OVX control and Rptor cKO mice administrated with E2 for 3 consecutive days. Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI. n = 3 in each group. The experiments were repeated three
  times. Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale bars: 75 μm. D Heatmap of the expression
  level of estrogen-regulated target genes in the vagina of control and Rptor cKO
  mice in the presence or absence of E2 administration for 3 days. E Estrogen-regulated
  target genes in D were validated by qPCR. n = 7 (OVX control mice), n = 5 (OVX Rptor
  cKO mice), n = 6 (OVX control mice treated with E2), n = 5 (OVX Rptor cKO mice treated
  with E2). Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM.'
