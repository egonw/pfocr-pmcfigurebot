caption: 'Western blotting analysis of the levels of IĸB-α in HL60R cells. The cells
  were treated for 24 h with different compounds. (a): Relative protein level (mean
  ± standard error of three experiments). Differences when treatments are compared
  to the control: ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05; derivates versus precursor: ap < 0.05;
  bp < 0.01 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). (b): Representative immunoblots
  of three independent experiments with similar results.'
