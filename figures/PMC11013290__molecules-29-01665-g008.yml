caption: 'The improvement effect of LGU on the OGD-induced activation of the necroptosis
  signaling pathway in rat primary cortical neurons. (A–C) The expressions of RIP1
  (A), RIP3 (B), and MLKL (C) were detected by Western blotting assay. (D) The representative
  images of expression and the nuclear translocation of MLKL (green) were detected
  by immunofluorescence combined with laser confocal analyses (on the left: 200×;
  on the right: 600×). Selected representative sections are circled with white square.
  DAPI (blue) was used for staining nuclei. (E,F) The 2D interaction map of LGU (E)
  and GSK872 (F) with the active site of RIP3. (G,H) The surface (G) and alignment
  (H) of GSK872 (light green) and LGU (dark green) inside the active binding site
  of RIP3 in the Maestro 3D. Data are expressed as the means ± SEM, n = 3. #: p <
  0.05, ##: p < 0.01 vs. ctrl group, *: p < 0.05, and **: p < 0.01, vs. OGD group.'
