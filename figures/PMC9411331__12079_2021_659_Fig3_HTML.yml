caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis and deletion studies of the promoter region of CCN5.
  a Schematic illustration of CCN5 promoter region (− 1800/+ 21) upstream of the coding
  state of CCN5 gene. All tracks were set and displayed as dense. Red arrows demonstrate
  Transcription Start Site (TSS)/+ 1. (1) CCN5 gene is located on chromosome 20. The
  numbers are indicative of the base position with the genomic coordinates of the
  displayed region (gene promoter). (2) Homo sapiens WNT1 inducible signaling pathway
  protein 2 (WISP-2)/CCN5, mRNA, assembled by UCSC genome browser. (3) SwitchGear
  TSS: location of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) throughout the human genome. Red
  arrow illustrates the chosen TSS/+ 1 with higher confidence score based on reported
  experimental evidence. (4) Transcript variants alignments of CCN5 according to RNA
  reference sequences (RefSeq) gene predictions from NCBI. (5) H3K27Ac mark: this
  involves acetylation of lysine 27 of the H3 histone protein. H3K27Ac is defined
  as an active enhancer mark often found near active regulatory elements. Overlayed
  H3K27Ac tracks show where modification of histone proteins is suggestive of enhancer
  and, to a lesser extent, other regulatory activity. (6) DNase I hypersensitive clusters
  (from ENCODE analysis) which are accessible chromatin zones, transcriptionally active
  and necessary for the binding of transcription factors. A gray box designates the
  degree of the hypersensitive region. The darkness is relative to the maximum signal
  strength observed in any of the reported 125 cell types. (7) Txn Factor ChIP: transcription
  factor (161 factors) binding motifs from a large collection of ChIP-seq experiments
  (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) performed by the ENCODE Factorbook
  repository. Clusters are showing occupancy regions for each factor and motif sites
  within the regions. A gray box surrounds each peak cluster of transcription factor
  occupancy. The darkness is indicative of the maximum signal strength observed in
  any cell line contributing to the transcription factor occupancy. A green highlight,
  within a cluster indicates the highest scoring site of a Factorbook-identified established
  motif for the corresponding transcription factor. b Full length WISP-2/CCN5 promoter
  (− 1800/+ 21) immediately preceding the transcription start site (TSS/+ 1) and coding
  sequence of firefly luciferase (FLUC) as reporter of CCN5 promoter activity. Consensus
  enhancer/suppressor elements in the promoter region of CCN5 are predicted and indicated
  according to the Transfac database. c Schematic demonstrating various deletions
  of the − 1800/+ 21 promoter construct with indications of the previously identified
  glucocorticoid response (enhancer) element (GRE). After infection of primary cardiac
  fibroblasts d with recombinant adenovirus encoding luciferase under control of the
  CCN5 promoter fragment with various deletions, the cells were stimulated with 100 nM
  dexamethasone or vehicle for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity. The results
  are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent experiments with two replicates
  per condition) of luciferase activity in primary cardiac fibroblasts stimulated
  in the absence or presence of dexamethasone. Statistical significance was assessed
  by unpaired Student’s two tailed t-test. ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001'
