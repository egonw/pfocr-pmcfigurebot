caption: 'Effects of COG1410 on the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway at 72 h after cerebral
  I/R. (a) Representative images of the colocalization of TXNIP and NLRP3 (red) with
  microglia (Iba-1, green) in the hippocampal area. (b) Representative bands of Western
  blot data. (c, d) Quantitative analysis of TXNIP-positive and NLRP3-positive microglia.
  (e–i) Quantitative analysis of the Western blot bands. Data were represented as
  mean ± SEM. Western blot, n = 6 per group; double immunofluorescence staining, n
  = 8 per group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. I/R
  + Vehicle group.'
