caption: 'RZL inhibits inflammatory reactions in the submandibular gland of SS mice.
  (a) HE staining of submandibular gland tissue after different treatment. Scar bar
  = 50 μm (400×). (b) Representative immunoblot bands of IL-17 and quantitative expression
  of IL-17 protein in mouse submandibular gland tissue. (c) IL-17 mRNA expression
  in mouse submandibular gland tissue. (d) Immunohistochemistry was used for IL-17
  protein determination. Scar bar = 50 μm (400×). In comparison to the control group,
  ∗P < 0.05; in comparison to the model group, #P < 0.05; in comparison to the hydroxychloroquine
  group, ΔP < 0.05.'
