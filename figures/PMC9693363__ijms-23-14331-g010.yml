caption: 'Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway provides protection against
  PF: (a–d) The expression of fibrosis proteins induced by BLM in SD rats was decreased;
  the protein expressions of PI3K (b), p-AKT (c) and mTOR (d) in lung samples were
  examined by WB analysis; n = 3. (e–g) Representative statistical analysis of PI3K
  (e), AKT (f) and mTOR (g) mRNA by RT-qPCR; n = 3. Note: * represents p < 0.05 in
  comparison to the control group; # represents p < 0.05 in comparison to the model
  group.'
