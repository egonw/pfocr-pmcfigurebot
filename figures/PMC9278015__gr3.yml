caption: Canonical pathway and upstream analysis(A) Top 15 activated canonical signaling
  pathways in COVID-19 mRNA identified using Ingenuity pathway analysis. (B) Heatmap
  of gene expression as calculated through RNA-seq involved in the interferon signaling
  pathway of the samples. (C) Top 15 activated canonical pathways in miRNA-targeted
  mRNA expressions. (D) Heatmap of gene expression of miRNA-targeted mRNA expressions
  involved in the interferon signaling pathway of the samples. (E) Top 20 activated
  upstream regulators. (F) Top 20 inhibited upstream regulators. PD-1, programmed
  death-1; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TREM1, triggering receptor expressed
  on myeloid cells 1; PKR, protein kinase R; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; IL, interleukin; iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase.
