caption: '(a) Gene Ontology (GO) terms of the combined 8 human microarray and rat
  transcriptomic data. (A–C) Small airway epithelia cell differentially expressed
  gene (DEG) analysis. (D–F) Rat lung tissue DEG analysis. The rectangular length
  represents counts of the enriched DEGs. The line represents the negative log2P values
  (MF: molecular function; CC: cellular component; BP: biological process). (b) The
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the combined
  8 human microarray and rat transcriptomic data. (A–C) Small airway epithelia cell
  differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis for different groups. (D–F) Rat lung
  tissue DEG analysis from rat with CS exposure for different groups. The dot sizes
  represent counts of the enriched DEGs. The dot colors represent the negative log2P
  value.'
