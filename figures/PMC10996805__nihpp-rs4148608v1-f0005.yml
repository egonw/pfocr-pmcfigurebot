figure_title: Association of CD133 expression with inflammation and immune response-related
  pathways
caption: '(A) The boxplots of scores Thorson et al. pre-calculated regarding pro-inflammatory
  microenvironment; Lymphocyte infiltrating signature, TGF-β response, and TCR richness.
  The TCGA cohort was divided into low and high CD133 expression groups by median
  cut-off. Two-sided test was employed to calculate p-values, and the cutoff of less
  than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. (B) Boxplots showing the levels
  of infiltration by several types of immune cells; Th1 cells, M1 and M2 macrophages,
  cDC in the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts. (C) The boxplots showing cytolytic activity,
  which summarizes the overall killing ability of immune cells. (D) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) of inflammation and immune response-related pathways; inflammatory
  response, TNFα signaling via NFκB, complement, allograft rejection, IL-6 JAK STAT
  signaling pathway, and TGFβ signaling pathway. The classical GSEA method was employed
  to calculate NES and FDR values, and the cutoff of FDR < 0.25 was regarded as statistically
  significant. TCR, T cell Receptor: cDC, classical dendritic cells.'
