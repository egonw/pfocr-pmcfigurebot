caption: Illustration of the links between sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase
  type 3 (SERCA3)- and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase type 2b (SERCA2b)-dependent
  pathway in platelet activation. Thrombin stimulation at low concentration activates
  2 signaling pathways, the first one leading to the production of nicotinic acid
  adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) promoting SERCA3 stores mobilization and
  the second one activating phospholipase C and production of 1,4,5, inositol trisphosphate
  (IP3), releasing Ca2+ from SERCA2b stores. The first pathway results in a rapid
  secretion of ADP (red arrow) that potentiates the second SERCA2b-dependent pathway
  via the ADP receptor P2-class purinergic receptor type Y subtype 12 (P2Y12) (not
  P2-class purinergic receptor type Y subtype 1 [P2Y1]) []. Note that P2Y12 cannot
  activate Phospholipase C directly but probably indirectly by TxA2 and its receptor
  TPα, which activate phospholipase C and the release of IP3, as suggested by the
  fact that the potentiation step is indomethacin-sensitive []. Note that ADP released
  via this pathway (blue arrow) may also activate P2Y12.
article_title: ADP receptor P2Y12 is the capstone of the cross-talk between Ca2+ mobilization
  pathways dependent on Ca2+ ATPases sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum type 3 and
  type 2b in platelets.
