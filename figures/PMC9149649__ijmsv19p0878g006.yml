caption: 'Gefitinib and C188-9 abrogated NPNT-induced EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 signalling activation.
  HUVECs were preincubated with Gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor, 10 μM) or C188-9 (STAT3
  inhibitor, 10 μM) for 1 h and then stimulated with NPNT (500 ng/ml) for 20 min.
  The phosphorylation levels of EGFR, JAK2 and STAT3 were all decreased in Gefitinib
  pretreatment. While only phosphorylated STAT3 not phosphorylated EGFR or phosphorylated
  JAK2 was inhibited by C188-9 treatment, indicating NPNT activated EGFR followed
  by activating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Gefitinib and C188-9 were dissolved with DMSO,
  thus identical dose of DMSO was added to the control group and NPNT group, respectively.
  * P < 0.05 versus DMSO group, # P < 0.05 versus NPNT group.'
