caption: CRC-CM upregulated myeloid differentiation-associated genes. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering heatmap of myeloid differentiation-related genes in KG1 cells treated
  with DLD1-derived CM versus control. (B) Boxplot of myeloid differentiation-related
  genes in KG1 cells treated with DLD1-derived CM versus control. Green and red boxes
  indicate gene expression of control and DLD1-derived CM-treated cells, respectively.
  (C) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway map for hematopoietic
  stem cell lineage pathway in KG1 cells treated with DLD1-derived CM. The red color
  represents upregulated surface markers, while the blue color represents downregulated
  factors.
