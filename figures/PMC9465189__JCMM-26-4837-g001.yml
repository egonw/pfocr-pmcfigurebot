caption: SERPINA5 regulates PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway through inhibiting CBL.
  (A) The interaction between SERPINA5 and CBL was showed by GeneMANIA online software.
  (B) The decreased expression of CBL in GC cell lines both in mRNA and protein levels.
  (C) The upregulated expression of CBL after silencing SERPINA5 in MKN‐28 cell lines
  (D) CO‐IP was performed to confirm the interaction between SERPINA5 and CBL in MKN‐28
  cell lines. Western blot analysis showing that CBL negatively regulates PI3K/AKT
  signalling pathway in (E) MKN‐28 and (F) BGC‐823 cells. (G) Knockdown of SERPINA5
  can inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway. (H) The novel mechanism by which high expressed
  SERPINA5 induces GC progression. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
