caption: Experimental design for CBD and MA treatments in rats. (A) Chemical structure
  of MA. (B) Chemical structure of CBD. (C) Experimental protocols. Acclimation phase
  (days 1–3). Drug administration was once a day over 4 weeks (days 4–31). Rats in
  the MA group received MA (10 mg/kg) by IP injection. The CBD40 + MA group and the
  CBD80 + MA group rats received MA (10 mg/kg) following 1 h of CBD treatment (40
  or 80 mg/kg, IP). The control group rats received saline solution (containing 5%
  DMSO +5% Tween-80, 10 mL/kg, IP). The rats in CBD80 group received CBD only (80
  mg/kg, IP). On day 32, all the rats were sacrificed for the collection of hearts
  and blood for further analysis. CBD, cannabidiol; MA, methamphetamine; IP, intraperitoneal;
  DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Tween-80, polysorbate 80.
