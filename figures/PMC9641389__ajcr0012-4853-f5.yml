caption: MiR-122 suppresses the expression of downstream factors in the δ-catenin
  signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting analyses of the δ-catenin, cyclin D1, and
  c-myc proteins in Rv-1 and DU145 cells 48 h after transfection with miR-con, a miR-122
  mimic, or a miR-122 inhibitor. Actin was used as an internal control. (B, C) A qRT-PCR
  analysis of the expression levels of the mRNAs encoding c-myc (B) and cyclin D1
  (C) in Rv-1 and DU145 cells 48 h after transfection with miR-con, a miR-122 mimic,
  or a miR-122 inhibitor. (B, C) The mean values and SEMs were calculated from triplicates
  of a representative experiment; ***P < 0.001; NS, no significant difference compared
  with miR-con.
