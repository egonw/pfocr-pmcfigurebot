caption: 'NLXTD induced angiogenesis factor expression and activated the HIF-1α/VEGF
  signaling pathway at 7 d after reperfusion. (a) Representing western blot analysis
  of HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR2, and Notch1. (b) Quantitative analysis of protein levels
  of HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR2, and Notch1. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD(n = 3); ∗P < 0.05 versus the sham group; #P < 0.05
  versus the I/R group; &P < 0.05 versus the 2ME2 group; ▲P < 0.05 versus the 2ME2
  + NLXTD group. (c) The mRNA expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF, and Notch1 (mean ± SD,
  n = 3). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the sham group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01
  versus the I/R group.'
