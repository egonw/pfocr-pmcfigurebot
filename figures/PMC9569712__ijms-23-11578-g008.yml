caption: Activation of CncC pathway by the curcumin induces the expression of CYP4BQ1
  and enhances adults’ tolerance to (+)-α-pinene. Adults were treated with the CncC
  agonist curcumin for 48 h. The relative expression levels of CncC, Maf, and CYP4BQ1
  (A,B) were detected by RT-qPCR. The activities of P450 (C) in the midgut of adults
  were determined spectrophotometrically. (D) Curcumin-treated adults were then exposed
  to (+)-α-pinene, and mortality was assessed after 24 h. The asterisk indicates a
  significant difference between treatment groups (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001, independent Student’s t-test). All values are the mean ± SE, n = 3.
