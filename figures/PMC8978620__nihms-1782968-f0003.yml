figure_title: Immune-stimulatory pathways are activated in sTCR+CoCAR3+ T cells upon
  sequential tumor challenge
caption: A) Detection of IFNγ, perforin, and TNFα in co-culture supernatants 24 hours
  after the second tumor challenge (n=4) as described in . B-C) RNA expression in
  engineered T cells 24 hours after second tumor challenge using Nanostring (See ).
  B) Heatmap showing genes with significant log2 fold-changes (sTCR+ vs. sTCR+CoCAR3+
  T cells, p<0.05; n=4). C) Pathway scores for sTCR+ and sTCR+CoCAR3+ T cells as determined
  by NanoString. (A, C) Statistical significance was determined by paired t-test,
  *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.005; mean±SD, ‘n’ denotes the number of individual healthy
  donors.
