caption: HDV antigens activate the antioxidant Nrf2/ARE pathway. (a,b) Huh7 cells
  were co-transfected with plasmids encoding S-HDAg (pDL444), L-HDAg (pDL445), the
  full HDV genome (pSVLD3), empty pVax1 vector as a negative control or HCV core protein
  as a positive control with the reporter plasmids encoding a luciferase gene under
  the control of the SV40 promoter with minimum ARE (pP-ARE) or promoters of Nqo1
  (pNqo1-luc) or HO-1 (pHOGL3/9.1). Two (a) or four (b) days post-transfection, luciferase
  expression was quantified by assaying its enzymatic activity in cell lysates. (c–g)
  Huh7 cells were transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids, and the mRNA (c,d)
  or protein (e,f) levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.
  (g) The cytoplasmic (Cyt) and nuclear (Nu) protein fractions were separated using
  an NE-PER kit, and the levels of Nrf2, as well as β-actin and histone H3 as control
  cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, were assessed in them by western blotting. Bars
  represent the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  post hoc test (a) or an unpaired Student’s test with Welch correction (b). ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. to pVax1-transfected cells.
