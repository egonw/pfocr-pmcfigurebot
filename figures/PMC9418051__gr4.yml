caption: Differential effects of posaconazole (squares) and fluconazole (triangles)
  on the sterol profiles of L. donovani (A) and L. tarentolae (B) promastigotes. Fold
  change vs. vehicle control was calculated by taking the ratio of IS-normalized LC-MS/MS
  signals of each sterol between antifungal azole-treated and vehicle-treated promastigotes.
  Bars and error bars represent the mean and standard error of three independent measurements.
  The lines connecting the symbols are to distinguish different treatments and the
  order of sterols on the x-axis is arranged to follow the conversion of 4- and/or
  14-methylated sterols to 4,14-demethylated sterols, then to 5-dehydro sterols from
  left to right as shown in the .
article_title: Sterol profiling of Leishmania parasites using a new HPLC-tandem mass
  spectrometry-based method and antifungal azoles as chemical probes reveals a key
  intermediate sterol that supports a branched ergosterol biosynthetic pathway.
