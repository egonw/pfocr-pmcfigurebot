figure_title: Foxcl is sufficient to promote Insr/Irs1 expression and muscle insulin
  sensitivity
caption: (A). GO analysis of RNA-seq and qPCR validation revealed Insr and Irs1 gene
  upregulation in muscle by the mutant GR. (B). Mutant muscle upregulated Foxc1 levels
  and its binding of canonical sites on the proximal promoter regions of Insr and
  Irs1. (C). WB analysis of whole and phosphorylated proteins showed increased activation
  of the insulin response pathway in the mutant muscle compared to control. (D) Validation
  of Foxc1-driven transactivation of Insr and Irs1 in C2C12 myoblasts in vitro. (E).
  In vivo AAV-based transduction showed that Foxc1 overexpression in muscle was sufficient
  to increase overall abundance of Insr and Irs1, increasing insulin-promoted 2DG
  uptake in vivo. N=3–5/group; Welch’s t-test; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001;
  ****, P<0.0001.
