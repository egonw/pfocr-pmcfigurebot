caption: MiR-7a is regulated by FSH via the JNK signaling pathway in mouse granulosa
  cells. (A) MiR-7a levels in granulosa cells were determined by RT-qPCR. (B) Analysis
  of p-JNK protein in primary granulosa cells with SP (JNK inhibitor, 10 μM). (C)
  Quantification of the Cyp19a1 expression in cells by RT-qPCR (normalized to GAPDH).
  (D) Estimation of estrogen concentration in the cell culture medium by RIA. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). Significant differences are indicated by *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. NS, not significant.
