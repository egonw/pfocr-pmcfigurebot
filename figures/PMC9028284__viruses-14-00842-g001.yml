caption: HuNoV transfection promotes AQP1 expression. (A–C). HuNoV transfection induced
  the expression of AQP1 in Caco2 cells. Caco2 cells were transfected with full-length
  HuNoV cDNA-expressing plasmid or empty vector for 24 h. The protein levels of AQP1,
  AQP4 and HuNoV VP1 were detected by WB (A) and quantified using Image J (B,C). (D,E).
  HuNoV promoted the activation of AQP1 promoter. Caco2 cells were co-transfected
  with empty vector or full-length HuNoV cDNA-expressing plasmid and AQP1-Luc or AQP4-Luc
  for 24 h. Cells were lysed and detected for the activity of Firefly luciferase.
  Values for the samples were expressed as a fold increase in the value induced in
  empty vector-transfected samples. (F,G). HuNoV promoted the transcription of AQP1.
  Caco2 cells were transfected with empty vector or full-length HuNoV cDNA-expressing
  plasmid for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted. The expression
  of AQP1, AQP4 and GAPDH genes was evaluated by relative real-time quantitative PCR.
  AQP1 and AQP4 mRNA copies were normalized using GAPDH and expressed as fold increase
  in the value for the empty vector (F,G). Data shown are mean ± S.D. of three independent
  experiments with each condition performed in triplicate. One representative experiment
  out of three is shown. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, not significantly.
