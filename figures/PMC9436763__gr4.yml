  to D) Echocardiographic examination of LVIDD, LVPWD, ejection fraction, fractional
  shortening, and LV mass in each group. LV mass/TL ratio was calculated. (E) Representative
  hematoxylin and eosin staining of sagittal sections of the hearts. Scale bar, 200 μm.
  (F) Relative mRNA levels of ANF, BNP, and β-MHC in the myocardia from cGAS−/− and
  Sting−/− mice with or without CKD. (G to J) Echocardiographic examination of LVIDD,
  LVPWD, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and LV mass in each group. LV mass/TL
  ratio was calculated. (K) Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining of sagittal
  sections of the hearts. Scale bar, 200 μm. (L) Relative mRNA levels of ANF, BNP,
  and β-MHC in myocardia in each group. Data represent mean ± SD and were analyzed
  using 1-way analysis of variance. n = 3 biologically independent experiments. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. Abbreviations as in  and .
