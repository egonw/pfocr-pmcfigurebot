caption: Schematic of the molecular mechanisms of synergistic oncogenicity induced
  by ALV-J and REV. After co-infection of ALV-J and REV, released or expressed structural
  proteins from ALV-J and REV in the cytoplasm synergistically elevate the expression
  levels of MSI1, which directly targets pri-miR-147, causing the inhibition of miR-147
  maturation, which relieves the inhibition of the NF-κB/KIAA1199/EGFR signaling pathway
  and thereby suppresses cellular senescence and activates the EMT process, promoting
  oncogenicity.
