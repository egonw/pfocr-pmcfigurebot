caption: 'In silico molecular docking analysis for potential small molecules against
  IGF-1R protein. The left lane represents the interaction of small molecules at the
  binding site of IGF-1R. The right lane indicates a 2D map of the interactions between
  small molecules and IGF-1R, including amino acid residue, sequence number and chain.
  The red lines display hydrophobic interaction, while the green line displays the
  hydrogen bond. The molecules binding IGF-1R and respective binding energy is as
  follows: (A) Pinoresinol with binding energy −6.7 Kcal/mol, (B) Vanillic acid with
  binding energy −5.2 Kcal/mol, and (C) DHT with binding energy −7.0 Kcal/mol.'

  on Mouse Myoblast Proliferation via the Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.
