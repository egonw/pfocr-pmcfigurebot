caption: Effects of BDDD-721 and curcumin on medulloblastoma cells. (A) Chemical structures
  of BDDD-721. (B) Effects of BDDD-721 and curcumin on DAOY, UW402, UW473 and ONS-76
  cells were analyzed by MTT assay in vitro. (C) Effects of BDDD-721 and curcumin
  on cell viability were evaluated by EdU assay. (D) Column chart represents the percentage
  of EdU positive cells analyzed by SPSS statistical software. (E) The proliferation
  antigen Ki67 and PCNA were detected by western blot. (F) Cell cycle was analyzed
  by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining for DNA content after BDDD-721
  treatment for 24h. (G) Cell cycle associated proteins of Cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6
  were examined by western blot. Compared with Control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: Curcumin analogue BDDD-721 exhibits more potent anticancer effects
  than curcumin on medulloblastoma by targeting Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway.
