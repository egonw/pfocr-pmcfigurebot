caption: 'DAPI and TUNEL double staining was performed to identify apoptotic cells,
  and SIRT3 staining and WB assay were conducted to detect SIRT3 expression in the
  heart sections. (A, B) show the number of DAPI‐ and TUNEL‐positive cells and apoptotic
  index in all groups. (C, D) Representative images of SIRT3‐positive cells in heart
  sections in all groups. (E, F) Estimation of SIRT3 levels in each group was carried
  out using the WB assay. *p < 0.05 versus control group; #p < 0.05 versus I/R group;
  Δp < 0.05 versus 34H+DMSO group. &p < 0.05 versus 34H+3‐TYP group.'
