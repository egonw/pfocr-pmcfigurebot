caption: Upstream regulators predicted to drive the temporal lobe epilepsy response
  in leukocytes with an overlap p-value < 0.05. Blue cells indicate predicted inhibition
  of the pathway, orange shows predicted activation. The shades for colored cells
  represent z-scores values. Color of nodes indicates predicted activation (orange)
  or deactivation (blue). The NFKB complex is a key node in this network. Figure prepared
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
