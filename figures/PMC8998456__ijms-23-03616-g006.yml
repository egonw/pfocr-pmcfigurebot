caption: 'Clustering of pathways abundance. In panel (a), Nonmetric Multidimensional
  Scaling analysis (nMDS) was performed considering the predicted functional abundances
  of all identified pathways. In panel (b), a heatmap considering the top three pathways
  that differentiated each contrast between varieties returned by SIMPER test is represented.
  Codes of represented pathways correspond to the following pathway descriptions:
  L-valine biosynthesis (VALSYN-PWY), L-isoleucine biosynthesis I (from threonine)
  (ILEUSYN-PWY), pyruvate fermentation to isobutanol (PWY-7111), superpathway of L-leucine,
  L-valine, and L-isoleucine biosynthesis (BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY), L-isoleucine
  biosynthesis III (PWY-3001) and aerobic respiration I (cytochrome c) (PWY-3781).'
