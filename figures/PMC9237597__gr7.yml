caption: 'Microneedles and exogenous stimulation-mediated formulations for follicular
  drug delivery. Ⅰ. Visualization pathway of C6 suspension, C6-NLCs, and C6-NLCs-MN
  using CLSM after 24 h of permeation in rat skin.  Ⅱ. Laser scanning microscopy (LSM)
  image of a follicular cross-section in the (a1) transmission and (a2) fluorescence
  mode from the AuNP-doped BSA particles treated group; LSM image of a follicular
  cross-section with a visible sebaceous gland in the (b1) transmission and (b2) fluorescence
  mode from the AuNP-doped BSA particles treated group. Scale bar = 250 µm.  Ⅲ (A)
  Schematic illustration of UVA-responsive nanocapsules (NCs). (B) CLSM images of
  porcine ear skin after 2 min of UVA irradiation and incubation with fluorescence-labeled
  NCs for 30 min. Scale bar = 200 µm. (C) Three-dimensional plot images of porcine
  ear skin treated with fluorescence-labeled NCs after (a) 0 min, (b) 2 min, and (c)
  8 min of irradiation with UVA (power density: 11.96 mW/cm2, peak wavelength = 365 nm).'
