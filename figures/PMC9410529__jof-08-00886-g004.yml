caption: Melanin biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in response to mechanical stimulus.
  (A) Summary of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of melanin biosynthesis pathway
  proposed in A. bisporus. GSEA analysis was performed in comparison with 0 min samples
  with indicated sample conditions. Bar graph indicates relative significance of enrichment
  in each condition; higher bar with deeper brown color indicates significant enrichment.
  Regulation patterns of melanin biosynthesis genes are indicated as colored dots.
  Green dots indicate up-regulation in each condition, while purple dots indicate
  down-regulation. Bigger dots indicate regulation was even significant in each condition.
  Melanin biosynthesis genes are indicated in . (B) Heatmap of leading-edge genes
  identified in GSEA analysis. CM; chorismate mutase, 4ABS; 4-aminobenzoate synthase,
  4ABH; 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase, GGT; γ-glutaminyltransferase, PDHtase; prephenate
  dehydratase, PDH; prephenate dehydrogenase, AT; (4-hydroxy) phenylpyruvate aminotransferase,
  PPO; polyphenoloxidase (tyrosinase), PAL; phenylalanine ammonialyase, C4H; Trans-cinnamate-4-monooxygenase,
  4CL; 4-coumarate CoA ligase, GHB; γ-l-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene, PAP; p-aminophenol,
  DOPA; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine.
