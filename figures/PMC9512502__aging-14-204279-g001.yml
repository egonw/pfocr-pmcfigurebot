caption: High expression of CXCR4 is correlated with RON in BC. Representative immunohistochemical
  staining for RON (A), and CXCR4 (B) protein expression in BC tumor and adjacent
  normal tissues. Average scores for RON (C), and CXCR4 (D) in BC tumor versus in
  adjacent normal tissues. The association with RON and CXCR4 expression in BC clinical
  samples was analyzed (E). RON and CXCR4 expression were detected by western blot
  in five representative BC tumor and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues (F),
  as well as in seven urothelial BC cells (G).
article_title: Tyrosine kinase receptor RON activates MAPK/RSK/CREB signal pathway
  to enhance CXCR4 expression and promote cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer.
