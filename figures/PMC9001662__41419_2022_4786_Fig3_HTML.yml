figure_title: Expression of P2X7 and NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream inflammatory
  factors in mREC cultured in the presence of different glucose concentrations
caption: 'a The relative mRNA expression of P2X7, NLRP3, Caspase 11, Caspase 1, IL-1β,
  and IL-18 under different conditions. b The relative protein expression levels of
  P2X7 and NLRP3 inflammasome under different conditions (5.5, 30, 50 mM D- glucose
  for 48 h. c The expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, Icam1, and IL-6 in cell culture medium
  supernatant under different conditions after 48 h was detected using customized
  ELISA kits. Cells treated with normal concentration of glucose (5.5 mM) were used
  as the control. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. the control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, vs. the LPS group.'
