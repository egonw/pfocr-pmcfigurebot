caption: Effect of TS and APS on protein levels of autophagy signaling pathway in
  transported-chicks. (A) AMPK/GAPDH. (B) p-AMPK/GAPDH. (C, D) The protein levels
  of autophagy-related factors determined by Western blotting analysis; GAPDH was
  served as loading control for the total fractions respectively. (E) Beclin1/GAPDH.
  (F) LC3II/I ratio. (G) Correlation analysis between autophagy-related factors and
  damage score. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. At
  the same time point, the same letters mean the difference is not significant (P
  > 0.05), different small letters mean a significant difference (P < 0.05) and different
  capital letters for the extremely significant difference (P < 0.01).
