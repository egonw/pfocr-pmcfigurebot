caption: 'Effect of acupuncture treatment on NF-κB expression in D-gal-induced aging
  skeletal muscle. (A) The paravertebral muscle of rats in each group was harvested
  for fluorescent immunohistochemical staining with NF-κB (red) and DAPI (blue), ×400.
  (B) Evaluation of the percentage of NF-κB-positive muscle cells. (C) Percentage
  of the NF-κB-positive area in skeletal muscle after treatment. ***, P<0.001 relative
  to the control group; ###, P<0.001 relative to the D-gal group; ^^, P<0.01 and ^^^,
  P<0.001 relative to the DA group (n=5 for each group). DAPI, 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; D-gal, D-galactose; A, acupuncture; N, non-acupoint;
  IOD, integrated option density; DA, D-gal acupuncture.W'
