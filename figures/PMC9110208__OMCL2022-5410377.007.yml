caption: OG suppresses autophagy by activating mTOR signaling in bone tissue of SAMP6
  mice and osteoclast derived from RAW264.7 cells. (a) Representative Western blot
  images and the quantification of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K expression in
  bone tissue of SAMP6 mice. (b) Representative Western blot images and the quantification
  of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K expression in the osteoclast with the treatment
  of OG or RAP incubation for 48 h. Each point represents mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the indicated group.
