caption: Changes in the serum metabolites after metabolic surgery. (A) Differential
  expressed metabolite features after surgery. Pre-surgery and post-surgery sera metabolite
  features identified by using an untargeted metabolomic platform gas chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were annotated
  and compared. After metabolic surgery, 95 annotated metabolite features were enriched,
  and 248 features were decreased (adjusted p < 0.05). (B) Venn diagrams showed the
  numbers of common and unique metabolites altered in patients after having three
  different metabolic surgery techniques (GB, laparoscopic gastric bypass; SG, laparoscopic
  sleeve gastrectomy; DJB–SG, laparoscopic duodenal-jejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy).
  (C) Correlation between differential-expressed metabolites and clinical indices.
  The correlation between 207 differential-expressed metabolites with KEGG ID, and
  9 obesity and diabetes mellitus-associated clinical indices were analyzed. Forty-five
  metabolites (one enriched and forty-four decreased) were significantly correlated
  with at least seven clinical indices (p < 0.05). Heat map of the Spearman’s rank
  correlation coefficient between these forty-five metabolites and nine clinical indices
  is shown. (D) Pathway enrichment analysis of the clinical indices-correlated metabolites.
  The pathway enrichment analysis of 45 clinical indices-correlated metabolites was
  performed by using pathway-associated metabolite sets (SMPDB), which contains 99
  metabolite sets based on normal human metabolic pathways on the MetaboAnalyst 4.0.
