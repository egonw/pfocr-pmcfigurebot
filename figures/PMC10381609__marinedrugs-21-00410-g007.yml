caption: The effects of EPA-PS and DHA-PS on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in neurons
  after oxidative damage. Representative western blots (A) and relative expression
  of p-PI3K (B) and p-AKT (C) in primary hippocampal neurons. The expressions were
  detected by Western blotting analysis and normalized with β-actin. * p < 0.05 indicates
  significant differences compared with the control group. Different letters represent
  significant differences at p < 0.05 among treated groups. This figure shows the
  mean ± SEM of 3 experiments.
