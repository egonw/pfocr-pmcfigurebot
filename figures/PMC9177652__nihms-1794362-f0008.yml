figure_title: Glutamine activates SREBP-1 to promote cell proliferation
caption: 'a, Heatmap comparison of metabolic and overall pathways based on RNA-seq
  data from H1299 cells under glucose, glutamine or a combination of glucose and glutamine
  vs. both free conditions (12 hr) using the bioinformatics Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). #NUM, no activity pattern available.b, c, Western blot analysis of cell lysates
  of cells stimulated with glutamine for 12 hr (b) or with 4 mM glutamine at the indicated
  times (c) under serum-free conditions (glucose 5 mM).d, Lipids derived from 14C-labeled
  glucose (0.5 μCi, 2 hr) in cells after culturing cells with/without glutamine (4
  mM) for 12 hr in serum-free medium containing 5 mM non-labeled glucose. The results
  are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3).e, Proliferation of cancer cells cultured in
  medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS with/without glutamine (4 mM) or glucose
  (5 mM) (mean ± SD, n = 3).f, g, Western blot analysis of cells after infection with
  shRNA-expressing lentivirus for 48 hr and then placed in fresh medium (5 mM glucose)
  with/without glutamine (4 mM) for another 12 hr (left panels). Cell proliferation
  was determined under 1% dialyzed FBS (right panels). The results are shown as mean
  ± SD (n = 3).h, Western blot analysis of cells after treatment with atorvastatin
  (5 μM) for 12 hr in 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) containing 5 mM glucose
  with/without glutamine (4 mM).i, Western blot analysis of cells after stimulation
  with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 12 hr in serum-free medium (5 mM glucose) with/without glutamine
  (4 mM).j, Western blot analysis of cells after incubation with/without aspartate
  (0.15 mM), asparagine (0.38 mM), leucine (0.38 mM), methionine (0.1 mM), threonine
  (0.17 mM) or glutamine (2 mM) for 12 hr in HBSS buffer (containing 5.6 mM glucose)
  supplemented with essential amino acids. The dose selected for each amino acid is
  same as their concentration included in RPMI 1640 medium.Significance was determined
  by unpaired and two-tailed Student’s t test (d) or two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  (e) or Tukey’s (g) multiple comparisons adjustment.'
