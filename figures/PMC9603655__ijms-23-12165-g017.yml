caption: Biodegradation pathway for poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) in aerobic conditions.
  PGA is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular enzyme, esterase to glycolic acid.
  Glycolic acid is converted to pyruvic acid via glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase
  catalyzes the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA, which is later metabolized
  through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy and releasing CO2 and
  water.
