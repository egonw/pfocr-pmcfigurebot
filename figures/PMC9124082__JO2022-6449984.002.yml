caption: Stichloroside C2 (STC2) can inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells.
  (a) Three breast cancer cell lines, comprising a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7),
  human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (MDA-MB-231), and mouse TNBC
  cell line (4 T1), and a normal epithelial cell line (IOSE-80) were selected and
  treated with a series of different concentrations of STC2 after treatment for 24 h,
  the cell viability was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to the control group. (b, c) Inhibition
  of TNBC cell clone formation by sea cucumber saponin monomer. Human MDA-MB-231 cells
  and mouse 4 T1 cells were treated with STC2 at different concentrations (0.25, 0.5,
  and 1 μM) for 24 h. The cells were cultured for 1–2 weeks and stained with crystal
  violet. The number of clones formed was detected. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared
  to the control group.
