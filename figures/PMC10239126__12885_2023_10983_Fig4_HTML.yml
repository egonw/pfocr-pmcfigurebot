caption: Identification of HSPB1-interacting genes and proteins and pathway analysis.
  The gene–gene interaction network and protein–protein interaction network of HSPB1
  were constructed using GeneMANIA A and STRING B. C The correlation between HSPB1
  and the altered neighboring genes using bc-GenExMiner v 4.8. D The GSCALite protocol
  was used to analyze the pathway activity (activation and inhibition)
article_title: High HSPB1 expression predicts poor clinical outcomes and correlates
  with breast cancer metastasis.
