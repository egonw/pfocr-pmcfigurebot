figure_title: Activation of Akt signaling pathway using a synthetic activator alleviates
  LH-induced adverse effects on endometrial stem cells
caption: A schematic diagram describing the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling in controlling
  LH-mediated adverse effects on various endometrial stem cell functions is shown
  (A). Cells were prestimulated with 10 µM Akt phosphorylation activator SC79 for
  1 h before 25 nM LH treatments for 48 h. LH-induced adverse effects on the self-renewability
  of endometrial stem cells were then evaluated using MTT-based assays (B). Akt activator
  SC79 treatment alleviates the LH-mediated inhibitory effects on migration potential
  as determined using transwell assays (C) and western blotting for MMP-2 and MMP-9
  (D). Cells were prestimulated with 10 µM Akt activator SC79 for 1 h before 25 nM
  LH treatment for 48 h. Akt activator SC79 treatment alleviates the LH-mediated inhibitory
  effects of adipocyte (E) and osteoblast G differentiation abilities as demonstrated
  using oil red O and alizarin red S staining, respectively. Akt phosphorylation activator
  SC79 (10 µM) alleviates the LH-mediated changes in the mRNA expression levels of
  multipotency-associated genes C-MYC, KLF4, NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 as evaluated using
  qPCR (G). β-actin was used as an internal control to normalize protein expression.
  PPIA was used as an internal control to normalize mRNA expression for qPCR analysis.
  All experiments were performed in triplicates. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation (SD). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; and ***, p < 0.001 (two-sample t test).
