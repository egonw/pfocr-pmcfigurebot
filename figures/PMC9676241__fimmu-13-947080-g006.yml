caption: microbial profiles of CRC and GC. (A) Venn diagram shows the overlap of microbiotas
  from CRC and GC. Five hundred forty-eight microbiotas were shared between GC and
  CRC. Two hundred sixty-five microbiotas unique to GC, 93 microbiotas unique to CRC.
  (B) Plot shows the chao 1 alpha diversity index distribution between CRC and GC
  groups. (C) Bar plot shows the relative abundance of the top 10 microbiotas in CRC
  and GC at the genus level. (D) Dot plot shows the top 10 differentially abundant
  OTUs between CRC and GC at the species level. (E) Heatmap shows the function enrichment
  pathway of microbiotas in CRC and GC. (F) A brief summary of major differences between
  CRC and GC in synchronous cancer patients.
