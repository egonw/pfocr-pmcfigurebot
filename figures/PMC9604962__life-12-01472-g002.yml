caption: Exosomes carrying CD24, named EXO-CD24, combine advantages of both exosomes
  as a novel drug delivery platform and CD24 as a potent immune checkpoint surveillance
  molecule. CD24 interacts with both DAMPs and Siglec 10. CD24’s link to DAMPs prevents
  them from binding to the TLRs, therefore inhibiting the NF-ĸB pathway that induces
  the production of cytokines and chemokines. At the same time, the CD24-Siglec 10
  axis negatively regulates the activity of NF-ĸB through ITIM domains associated
  with SHP-1. While CD24 interacts with DAMPs and Siglec 10, it does not affect immune
  recognition through PAMPs, thereby allowing the innate immune response to achieve
  viral clearance. CD24, Cluster of differentiation 24; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular
  patterns; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; NF-κΒ, nuclear factor-κΒ;
  PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; Siglec 10, sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like
  lectin 10; SHP-1, SRC homology 2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase
  1; TLR, Toll-like receptor. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 7 September
