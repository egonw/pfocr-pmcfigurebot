caption: KEGG pathway analysis of genome-wide transcriptomic changes in C. reinhardtii
  cells after X- or γ-irradiation with two different doses. The numbers of common
  genes with a more than two-fold transcription change in both XR6 and GR6 (or XR50
  and GR50) groups are 694 and 443 (or 824 and 541) for 2×UP and 2×DN, respectively.
  XR6 (GR6) and XR50 (GR50) represent X-rays (γ-rays) of 6 and 50 Gy, respectively.
