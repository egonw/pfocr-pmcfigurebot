caption: A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM-10) depletion induces matrix metalloproteinase
  12 (MMP-12) disorders in RAW264.7 cells. (a) ADAM-10 interference in RAW264.7 cells.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. The dot plots show the statistical analysis of the expression
  level of ADAM-10 via qualitative PCR (qPCR). Each dot represents a readout. (b)
  Tandem mass tag (TMT) results; 40 proteins were downregulated and 30 proteins upregulated
  in ADAM-10 RAW264.7 depleted cells compared to control cells. Each dot represents
  a readout. (c) Hierarchical clustering analysis results of the significant proteins
  from (b). Results are shown in a heat map. (d) KEGG pathway analysis of the different
  proteins. (e) Protein interaction network analysis revealing that interfered ADAM-10
  (sh ADAM-10) decreases MMP-12 expression. (f) Biological Process Gene Ontology (GO)
  term enrichment analysis results for the different proteins.
