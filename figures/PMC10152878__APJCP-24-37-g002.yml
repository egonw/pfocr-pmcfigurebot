caption: Activation of PPAR pathway inducing fatty acid oxidation (diagram created
  using BioRender software). Under normal circumstances, PPARɑ up-regulates the peroxisomal
  β-oxidation by increasing the expression of the enzyme AOX, which facilitates the
  conversion of Acyl-CoA. However, when subjected to HRW, the hydrogen group lowers
  the activation of PPARɑ, resulting in the reduced expression of AOX. VLCFA very-long-chain
