figure_title: Western blot analysis of molecular pathways involved in RGC death after
  systemic hypotension
caption: Western blots of (A) intrinsic apoptotic, (B) extrinsic apoptotic and necroptotis,
  and (C) protein kinase signaling pathways. Involvement of (D) intrinsic apoptosis,
  (E– F– G) extrinsic apoptosis and necroptosis associated with tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF), and (H, I) Fas were significantly altered following induction of systemic
  hypotension. J– K– L Molecules associated with kinase signaling pathway were upregulated.
  For western blot analysis, n = 6 for control and n = 6 for systemic hypotension
  at each time period; total n = 96. Bar represents mean ± SD. Student’s t-test was
  used for statistical evaluation. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared
  to the control.
