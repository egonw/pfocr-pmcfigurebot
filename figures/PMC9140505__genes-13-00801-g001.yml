caption: 'Effect of acidosis on agonist-induced contractile response in superior mesenteric
  artery (SMA): (A) Histamine-; (B) KCl-induced contractile responses in SMAs elicited
  at pHo 7.4 are attenuated with a leftward shift of the CRC at pHo 6.8 and 6.0; Representative
  tracing (C) showing histamine-induced contractile responses in SMA rings at pHo
  7.4, 6.8, and 6.0. * p < 0.05, comparison vs. normal pHo (7.4), n = 6–14.'
