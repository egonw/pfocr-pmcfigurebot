figure_title: The TI2-induced subnetwork
caption: The TI2-induced subnetwork was highlighted green in the PN model of . The
  subnetwork covers the formation of complex IIb (place CIIb indicated by a red arrow)
  and induction of apoptosis (transition Apoptosis indicated by a red arrow) via the
  activation of CASP3 (places CASP3 as logical places indicated by a red arrows) in
  the extrinsic pathway. Additional logical places that connected graphical subnetworks
  were Procaspase3 and TRADD:RIP1, each marked by a red arrow.
