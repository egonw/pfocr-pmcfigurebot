caption: 'miR-520a-3p targets E2F7. (a) Binding sites of miR-520a-3p and E2F7. The
  binding of miR-520a-3p to E2F7 was determined by dual luciferase reporter gene assay
  (b) and RNA pull-down (c). (d) qRT-PCR was used to detect the transfection efficiency
  of miR-520a-3p mimics in PLC-PRF-5 and HepG2 cells. (e) The effect of miR-520a-3p
  on E2F7 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. (f) qRT-PCR was used to detect the transfection
  efficiency of circLATS2. (g). The effect of circLATS2 on E2F7 expression was detected
  by qRT-PCR. (h) qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of E2F7 in paracancer
  and HCC tissues. HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time
  polymerase chain reaction.'
