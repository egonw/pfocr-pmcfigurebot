caption: Knockdown of HSP90AA1 promoted CSFV replication. (A) RT-PCR determined CSFV
  NS5B copy numbers at 24 and 48 hpi in HSP90AA1 knockdown PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells.
  (B) Western blot for HSP90AA1 and CSFV Npro expression in HSP90AA1 knock-downed
  PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells, and the relative levels of Npro in HSP90AA1 knock-downed
  PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells were estimated by histograms representing density readings
  of the gel bands with Image J, and the ratios were calculated relative to tubulin
  control. (C) Infectious progeny viral titers in supernatants from HSP90AA1-knockdown
  PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. Viral titers from the supernatant collected at 24 and 48
  hpi were determined and expressed as TCID50/ml. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  and ****p < 0.0001 calculated using two-way ANOVA, ns, not significant).
