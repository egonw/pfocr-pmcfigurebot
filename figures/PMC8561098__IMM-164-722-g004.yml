caption: 'Structural overview of BTK and BTK inhibitors and its position within the
  B‐cell receptor signalling pathway. (a) The 77 kDa BTK protein consists of 659 amino
  acids, which make up the five domains for protein interaction. The 2 critical sites
  within the protein are Y223 and (SH3 domain) and Y551 (kinase domain: orange/yellow
  domain). (b) BTK inhibitors act through the binding to one of the proteins interacting
  domains and blocking BTK’s catalytic action. The main site of binding for current
  covalent inhibitors is the C481 residue within the kinase domain. This includes
  ibrutinib and second‐generation inhibitors acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib and tirabrutinib
  as depicted at the 3D models (data obtained from SWISS‐MODEL repository by the Swiss
  Institute of Bioinformatics [] for the crystal structures of each BTK domain and
  then NCBI''s PubChem database for the line structures for each inhibitor []). (c)
  A simplified version of B‐cell receptor signalling pathway and BTK position within
  it []'
