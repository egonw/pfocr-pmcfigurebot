caption: 'Psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune mechanisms of the placebo effect. The administration
  of a placebo generates a series of psychological and physiological changes in an
  individual. From the psychological standpoint, it can cause expectations or work
  as a conditioned stimulus. This is transmitted at the neurological level through
  an increase in the neurotransmission of μ opioid receptors in the rostral, pre and
  subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex, the orbitofrontal
  cortex, the anterior insular cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, the thalamus,
  and the periaqueductal substantia nigra. This mechanism is involved in placebo-mediated
  analgesia and anxiolytic responses. Likewise, there is an increase in the transmission
  of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in placebo analgesia conditioned with non-opioid
  mechanisms and an increase in dopaminergic transmission in PD patients treated with
  placebos, leading to clinical improvement. On the other hand, the close communication
  between the CNS and the immune system allows for conditioned immune suppression.
  In this mechanism, the insulate cortex, the amygdala, the sympathetic nervous system
  as the main efferent pathway, and noradrenaline as the neurotransmitter responsible
  for immune suppression are involved. Likewise, a conditioned response in different
  components of the endocrine system has been observed. However, the mechanisms mediating
  this have not been described yet. PD: Parkinson’s disease.'
