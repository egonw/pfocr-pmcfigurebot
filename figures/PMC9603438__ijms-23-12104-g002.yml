caption: VX-680 activates the p53-mediated checkpoint pathway but not the tumor suppressor
  Rb. RPE-NEO cells were exposed to 300 nM of VX-680 for three days. Cells were collected
  at the indicated time points after the initiation of drug treatment for the analysis
  of the indicated proteins by Western blot. The blots were cropped, and the full-length
  original blots are presented in . Quantification of p53, p21, and p16 in (A) is
  presented in (B). Quantification of total Rb, Rb phosphorylated at Ser780, and the
  percentage of Rb phosphorylation at Ser780 is shown in (C). A representative experiment
  is shown. Western blot was performed in two independent experiments. The quantification
  of a representative experiment in A has been presented in B and C. Two independent
  experiments produced the same trend.
