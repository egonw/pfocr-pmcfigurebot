caption: 'Summary of the effects of flavonols and flavones. The figure presents a
  range of signaling pathways of the inflammatory process and the stages where the
  compounds block the signaling cascade. The number represents the pathways inhibited
  by different compounds. For example, pathway 1 is blocked by the following compounds:
  quercetin, luteolin, 3′,4′-dihydroxyflavone, baicalein, nobiletin, and tangeretin.
  Scutellarin, vicenin-2, apigenin, 5-O-methyl-scutellarin, and the substances are
  able to block pathway 1 and inhibit pathway 2. Only luteolin and lucenin-2 inhibit
  pathway 3. Furthermore, pathway 4 can only be inhibited by luteolin. Most of the
  compounds previously mentioned in this review block pathway 5, except nobiletin,
  tangeretin, vicenin-2, and lucenin-2. Furthermore, luteolin, scutellarin, vicenin-2,
  and lucenin-2 inhibited pathway 6. Only isoquercetin blocks pathway 7, and luteolin
  blocks pathway 8.'
