caption: Screening of CAPN8-related hub pathways in thyroid cancer. (A, B) Coefficient
  profiles (A) and deviance profiles (B) of the adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage
  and Selection Operator regression model. Six cancer hallmarks were selected. (C)
  Error rate of the random survival forest (RSF) model. Eight cancer hallmarks were
  determined. (D, E) Importance (D) and marginal effect (E) of each pathway in the
  RSF model. The blue color represented pathways with a certain influence on overall
  survival, while the red color represented background noise with no impact on the
  dependent variable.
