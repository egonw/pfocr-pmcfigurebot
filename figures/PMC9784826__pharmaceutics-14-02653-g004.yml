caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection is tightly regulated spatiotemporally. A viral spike
  glycoprotein bound to the host receptor (ACE2, APN/CD13) of lipid rafts/caveolae
  for viral entry triggers the downstream mechanism of pathogenesis and immunity (adapted
  from []. Alternatively, viruses hijack autophagy machinery for viral replication.
  Third, we speculate that coronavirus might utilize multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
  and take advantage of the exosomal pathway for egress (adapted from []. Caveolae-budded
  EVs are potential hijackable gates in cell communication of caveolin-related diseases
  named caveolinopathies. Note that the question mark indicates an alternative pathway
  as speculated for coronavirus to utilize multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and to take
  advantage of the exosomal pathway for egress. [Figure reproduced under Creative
