caption: BLVRB effectively suppressed the activation of the Notch signaling pathway.
  A and B. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that a low expression level of BLVRB
  was positively associated with the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. C.
  Protein levels of c-Notch, active β-catenin, and total β-catenin after BLVRB knockdown.
  D. Protein levels of c-Notch, active β-catenin, and total β-catenin after BLVRB
  overexpression. E and F. Dual-luciferase assay shows Notch activity after knockdown
  or overexpression of BLVRB. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
