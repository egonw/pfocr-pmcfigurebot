caption: Effect of RPN2 as a downstream target gene of YTHDF1 on the proliferative
  capacity and cisplatin sensitivity of BLCA cells. (A) YTHDF1 single gene KEGG enrichment
  analysis of the top six pathways. (B) Intersection of YTHDF1 in the TCGA database
  with Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.4 and hallmark enrichment of
  the top five pathway genes. (C) Pearson’s correlation coefficient between RPN2 and
  YTHDF1 in the TCGA bladder cancer database. (D) RPN2 was highly enriched in the
  KEGG BLADDER CANER. (E) The expression of RPN2 was verified in 12 pairs of cancerous
  and paraneoplastic tissues collected from BLCA patients in our hospital. (F) Knockdown
  of RPN2 mRNA and protein in T24 and 5637 cells. (G,H) CCK-8 assay and EdU to validate
  the effect of RPN2 on the proliferative capacity of BLCA cells. (I) MTT assay to
  verify the effect of RPN2 on the cisplatin sensitivity of BLCA cells. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 or not significant (ns).
