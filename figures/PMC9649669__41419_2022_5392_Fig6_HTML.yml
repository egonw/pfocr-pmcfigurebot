figure_title: SR9009 inhibited the FOXM1 pathway through LXRα activation
caption: A LXRα expression in normal and tumor tissues from TCGA-PRAD datasets (GEPIA
  database). B Protein expression of LXRα and FOXM1 in PCa tissues relative to normal
  prostate tissues from The Human Protein Atlas databases. C Protein expression of
  LXRα and FOXM1 across prostate cell lines. D A negative correlation was found between
  LXRα and FOXM1. E mRNA expression profile of LXRα and FOXM1 relative to diploid
  samples in TCGA-PRAD (cBioPortal). F Western blot of LXRα knockdown validation in
  PC3 cells using siRNA transfection. G LXRα knockdown increased FOXM1 expression
  in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. H, I CCK-8 assay showed that knockdown of LXRα could rescue
  SR9009-induced cytotoxicity in PC3 (H; n = 3; means ± SDs; unpaired t test) and
  22RV1 cells (I; n = 3; means ± SDs; unpaired t test). J LXRα is negatively correlated
  with the expression of CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, and CCNB2 in TCGA-PRAD. K Effect
  of LXRα knockdown and/or SR9009 treatment on the expression of FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF,
  CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5. ns not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001.
