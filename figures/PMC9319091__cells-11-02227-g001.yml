caption: 'Diameter of longissimus dorsi fibers from Wu’an goats: (A) A representative
  transverse section of longissimus dorsi fibers from a 1-month-old goat. (B) A representative
  transverse section of longissimus dorsi fibers from a 9-month-old goat. (C) Muscle
  fiber diameter statistics for the mon1 and mon9 groups; three fibers per group were
  measured. Data are shown as the mean ± SE. ** p < 0.01.'
