caption: Brief mechanism of TXNIP in DKD. In response to ROS stimulation, TXNIP is
  released from TRX. Then, it binds to NLRP3 and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The activated NLRP3 can then cleave IL-1Î² and IL-18 precursors, inducing an immunoinflammatory
  response in the kidneys of diabetics. FOXO1 may ameliorate DKD by affecting ROS
  generation and TXNIP-TRX pathway. In addition, TXNIP also damages renal cell autophagy
  and lipid metabolism, resulting in the development of DKD.
