caption: Sex-specific characteristics of 5XFAD mice. Label-free proteomics analysis
  of sex-specific differentially expressed peptides in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.
  A, enriched functional networks of sex-specific molecular signatures in 5XFAD, networks
  are inferred from sex-specific DEPs and functionally annotated to GO terms and Reactome
  pathways. Node color denotes origin of dataset (blue and purple for male and female
  differentially upregulated peptides, respectively), node shape differentiates term
  origin (circle = GO biological process; hexagon = Reactome pathway), and node size
  determines significance of GO/Reactome terms (terms with p-value ≤ 0.05 shown).
  Term significance was calculated via two-sided hypergeometric test and Bonferroni
  step-down correction. B, the barplot indicates percentage of term coverage per term
  identified, bar color denotes enriched group (blue, purple, and gray for male, female,
  and both); the left panel details the proteins identified in each term. AD, Alzheimer’s
  disease; DEP, differentially expressed protein; GO, gene ontology.
