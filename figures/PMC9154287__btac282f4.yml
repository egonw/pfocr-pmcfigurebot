caption: The presence of one or two underground reactions can be sufficient to increase
  production yield. (A) Distribution of the number of underground reactions needed
  to increase production yields of target compounds. No more than four underground
  reactions have to be added to the native model to increase the yield in all cases.
  Furthermore, in most cases a single underground reaction is sufficient. (B) Matrix
  of underground reactions that contribute to the yield increments of each target
  compound. The columns represent the underground reactions (e.g. u0008, etc.) and
  their standard gene associations in parentheses, while the rows represent the target
  compounds. Cells in the upper part (marked as ‘Increased yield', red) belong to
  metabolites that can also be produced by the native metabolic network while the
  ones in the lower part (marked as ‘No native production', blue) require the presence
  of underground reactions. Multiple cells in one row account for multiple underground
  reactions whose joint presence is needed for production of the target compound.
  (C) Schematic view of central carbon metabolism (gray arrows) with underground reactions
  (red arrows) that enable the production of new compounds (yellow highlight) that
  cannot be produced by the native metabolic network. For details, see  (A color version
  of this figure appears in the online version of this article)
