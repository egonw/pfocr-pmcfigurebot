caption: 'Changed pathways and dysregulated molecules in brain and platelet of Alzheimer''s
  disease (AD) patients. To fully understand the central and peripheral dysregulated
  pathways, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on the molecules of the three
  modules: (A) unchanged in platelets but changed in the brain (data i); (B) changed
  in platelets but unchanged in the brain (data ii); (C) changed in both brain and
  the platelet (data iii). (D) The heat map shows the differential molecular expression
  profile of central and platelets (data iii). All 239 differentially expressed molecules
  were divided into four clusters (C1, C2, C3, C4). (E) A statistical summary of 239
  differentially expressed molecules in brain regions and platelets. (F) Principal
  component analysis (PCA) confirmed the efficiency of differential proteins in platelets.
  (G) The four clusters of different molecules are enriched in different biological
  processes. The ‐log10(P) was used to define the enrichment strength of biological
  processes. (H and I) Expression of representative high‐risk genes BAX and MAOB in
  platelets and entorhinal cortex, and their correlation with Mini‐Mental State Examination
  (MMSE). Stars represent significant correlations: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
  EC, entorhinal cortex; FC, frontal cortex; HP, hippocampus; IL, interleukin; MCI,
  mild cognitive impairment; TC, temporal cortex'
