caption: Ang II stimulation leads to mitochondrial fission and sirt6 downregulation
  in podocytes. (A) Electron microscopy ultrastructural image of podocyte mitochondria
  from the kidneys of normal or Ang II‐infused mice at 4 weeks. Scale bars = 1 μm.
  (B and C) Average length and aspect ratio of podocyte mitochondria from saline‐
  and Ang II‐infused mice at 4 weeks. (D and E) Western blot of Sirt6 protein expression
  in glomeruli isolated at different time points of treatment and the expression of
  Sirt6 standardized to GAPDH. (F–H) Western blot of Drp1 and Fis1 protein expression
  in isolated glomeruli and the expression of Drp1 and Fis1 standardized to GAPDH.
  (I–K) Western blot of Mfn2 and OPA1 protein expression in isolated glomeruli and
  the expression of Mfn2 and OPA1 standardized to GAPDH. *p < 0.05, n = 5
article_title: Sirt6 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial fission and oxidative
  damage in podocytes via ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling pathway.
