caption: Hypo-osmotic stress influences the immune system in gill cells. (A) IL-17
  signaling pathway was enriched in the SW/SFW group; green indicated the reduced
  transcripts, while red indicated the up-regulated transcript. The transcription
  factor, c-fos, could induce various down-stream targets. (B–H) Validations of the
  mRNA gene expression levels of the selected transcripts by real time qPCR. Down-regulation
  of the selected immune-related genes (transcription factor c-fos; interleukin-related
  genes (il1-r2; il1b; and il8); tissue remodelling gene, mmp9) and up-regulation
  of the selected immunoglobulin-related receptors (fcer2; and pigr) after the transfer.
  Results matched with the sequencing data. n = 5; mean ± s.e., * indicated p < 0.05.
