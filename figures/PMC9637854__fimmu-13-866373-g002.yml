caption: 'Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- mice showed decreased pleural pathology and altered balance
  of the arginine metabolic pathway. WT and Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- BALB/c mice were infected
  with L. sigmodontis and pleural cavity pathology and macrophages were investigated
  70 days post infection (dpi). (A–F) Scanning Electron Microscopy images of the parietal
  pleura: (A, B) Smooth pleura in naive mice; (F, I) high density of polyps in 70
  dpi WT mice, and (E, F) rare polyps in 70 days-infected Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- mice.
  (G) Collagen measurement in the pleural cavity flush. (H) Total number of F4/80+
  macrophages and Siglec-F+ eosinophils as determined by flow cytometry. (I) Expression
  of prototypical markers of alternative activation Chil3 and Mrc1 in pleural macrophages
  determined by qRT-PCR. (J) Collagen measurement in macrophage culture supernatant
  after 24h culture in vitro. (K) Simplified arginine metabolic pathway, adapted from
  (, ). (L) Expression of Arg1 by pleural macrophages determined by qRT-PCR. (M) In
  vitro arginase activity in pleural macrophages. Arginase activity was measured using
  QuantiChrom Arginase assay kit. (N) In vitro nitric oxide (NO) production (μM) from
  pleural macrophages after incubation for 16h with or without IFN-γ or filarial antigen
  (10µg/ml). (O) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFNgR1 expression on F4/80+
  pleural macrophages. Dots represent individual mice and results are expressed as
  mean ± SEM. (A–F) Images are representative of n=3 mice per group. (H) Pool of 4–6
  independent experiments n=20-27 mice per group. (J) n = 10. (I, L), n=6 per group.
  Two-way ANOVA: *p<0.05, ***p<0.001 represent differences between group; $$p<0.01,
  $$$p<0.001 represent differences between mice strains. (N) n=2-4 mice per group.
  (O) n = 8.'
