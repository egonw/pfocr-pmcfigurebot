caption: In HCC, miR-424-5p can be regulated by upstream pathways and regulate downstream
  pathways. (i) XIST can increase the expression of miR-424-5p, which inhibits ATG14,
  inhibiting HCC proliferation and migration. (ii) The decrease in DLX6-AS1 can target
  miR-424-5p to inhibit the expression of WEE1, which inhibits HCC proliferation and
  migration. (iii) PVT1 inhibits the expression of miR-424-5p by regulating the p53
  signaling pathway to promote HCC proliferation. (iv) LncRNAs, including MYLK-AS1,
  CDKN2B-AS1, and CAS9, can affect the expression of miR-424-5p to regulate HCC progression.
