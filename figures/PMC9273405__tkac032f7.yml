caption: Effects of OA-GL17d and miR-663a on the Smad signaling pathway in HaCaT cells.
  (a) Representative pictures of western blotting of p-Smad2, p-Smad3 and Smad2/3.
  (b, c) Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation levels of related proteins. Data
  were obtained from three independent experiments; ns no significance, *p < 0.05 
  and ***p < 0.001 indicate significant differences between two groups
