figure_title: nCB activates the HIF1α pathway to increase lactate in macrophages
caption: (A) Representative Western blots showing expression of the mTORC1 downstream
  targets p-S6K (T389) and p-4E-BP1 (T37/46). n = 3 biological replicates per group.
  (B and C) Effects of rapamycin on nCB-treated BMDMs. Cells were exposed to nCB (50
  μg/ml) for 24 hours, followed by 100 nM rapamycin (rap.) for another 24 hours. n
  = 4 biological replicates per group. (D) Heatmap of selected HIF1α-regulated genes
  in CD11c+ lung APCs from PBS-exposed or nCB-exposed WT mice. n = 3 per group. (E
  and F) Representative Western blots showing HIF1α in nCB-treated macrophages. n
  = 2 or 3 biological replicates per group. (G) Detection of hypoxia by pimonidazole
  in PBS- or nCB-exposed lungs. Scale bars, 100 μm. n = 5 biological replicates per
  group. (H) Lactate production in supernatants of nCB-treated BMDMs. Supernatants
  were collected 24 hours after nCB treatment. n = 4 per group. Representative (I)
  lactate production in the lungs and quantification of total live (J) FOXP3+ Treg
  cells; (K) PD-1+ LAG3+ CD4 T cells, (L) PD-1+ LAG3+ CD8 T cells, (M) PD-L1+ interstitial
  macrophages, and (N) PD-L1+ alveolar macrophages. n = 3 to 5 per group. All experiments
  have been repeated for two to three times and shown as representatives. Significance
  was determined by Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA with Holm’s
  correction. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.
