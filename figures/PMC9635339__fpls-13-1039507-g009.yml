caption: KEGG enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparisons
  of TM6 vs. CK (A), TM12 vs. CK (B), TM24 vs. CK (C), TM36 vs. CK (D) and TM48 vs.
  CK (E). The areas of bubbles indicate the number of enriched DEGs, while the color
  of bubbles indicates the Q value. The orange and blue rectangles indicate the KEGG
  pathways enriched with upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The blue triangle indicates
  the downregulated metabolic pathway identified in all five comparisons.
