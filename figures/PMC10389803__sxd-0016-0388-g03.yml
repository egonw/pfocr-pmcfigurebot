caption: Global changes in metabolism and epigenome during fetal male germ cell differentiation
  and spermatogenesis. The shading of the bars represents the predicted activation
  state of each metabolic pathway, with darker bars indicating higher activity. The
  question marks (?) indicate putative relation, as described in the text. The red
  text shows the metabolic pathways or metabolites that affect each process in male
  germ cell differentiation. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SGOC, Ser-Gly-one-carbon
  metabolism.
