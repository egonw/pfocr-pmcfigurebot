caption: 'Alternative synthesis of β-alanine in Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021.A, conservation
  of the genes of the alternative β-alanine synthesis pathway in S. meliloti 1021.
  The gray gene symbol is used for a gene unrelated to β-alanine metabolism. Sma and
  Smb, plasmidic gene localization; Smc, chromosomal gene localization. Colocalization
  of genetic loci was observed through the MicroScope platform. B, comparison of wildtype
  and ΔamaB growth. C–F, detection of DAP and 3AP after derivatization with benzoyl
  chloride and FMOC, respectively, in wildtype ADP1 and S. meliloti 1021 metabolomes.
  DAP and 3AP were monitored by LC/MS/MS on a QTRAP 5500 using a multiple reaction
  monitoring (MRM)–based approach. Extracted ion chromatograms are presented for three
  specific MRM transitions for both compounds. For DAP: green, 283.1 → 162.0; red,
  283.1 → 104.9; and blue, 283.1 → 77.0. For 3AP: blue, 296.0 → 179.0; green, 296.0
  → 118.0; and red, 296.0 → 74.0 (). C, DAP in S. meliloti 1021 metabolome. D, DAP
  in ADP1 metabolome. E, 3AP in S. meliloti 1021 metabolome. F, 3AP in ADP1 metabolome.
  LC/MS/MS analyses were conducted in the positive ionization mode. ADP1, Acinetobacter
  baylyi ADP1; 3AP, 3-aminopropanal; DAP, 1,3-diaminopropane; FMOC, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
  chloride.'
