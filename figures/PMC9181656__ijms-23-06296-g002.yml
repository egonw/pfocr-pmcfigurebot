caption: Schematic representation of Notch signaling and CAFs. (A) A crosstalk between
  Notch and GPER signaling pathways occurs in BCs and CAFs. E2 and the GPER selective
  ligand (G1) induce both the γ-secretase-dependent activation of Notch1 and the expression
  of the Notch target gene HES1. Moreover, E2- and G1-activated GPER triggers Notch-mediated
  BC and CAF cell migration and Snail and VE-Cadherin gene expression changes in BCs
  []. (B) Several myofibroblast subtypes are highly abundant in invaded LN and correlate
  with tumor cell invasion. The pro-metastatic CAF-S4 subtype stimulates BC invasion
  and motility in three dimensions (3D) by increasing contractility and matrix remodeling
  through Notch pathway activation []. (C) In TME, paracrine signaling initiated by
  several BC-secreted GFs and/or chemokines caused an increase in CCL2 mRNA and protein
  expression levels through STAT3 activation in CAFs; CCL2, in turn, binding to CCR2
  at CSCs membrane, induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation followed by Notch1 mRNA and protein
  expression increases leading to CSCs self-renewal and BC progression [].
