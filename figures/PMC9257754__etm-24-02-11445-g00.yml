caption: Expression of IL-10 in peripheral blood of patients with IPF and its effect
  on the biological function of MRC-5 cells. (A) Content of IL-10 in peripheral blood
  of IPF patients. ELISA was used to determine IL-10 content. *P<0.05. (B) Viability
  of MRC-5 cells after treatment with IPF serum in the absence or presence of IL-10
  antibody. CCK-8 assay was used to determine viability. *P<0.05 compared with NC
  group. (C) Percentages of MRC-5 cells at G1, S and G2 phases of cell cycle. Flow
  cytometry was performed to investigate the cell cycle. *P<0.05 compared with the
  NC group. (D) Expression of COL1a1 and COL1a2 proteins in MRC-5 cells. Western blotting
  was used to determine protein expression. *P<0.05 compared with NC group. NC, negative
  control group (untreated MRC-5 cells); IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; PI, propidium
  iodide; COL1a1, collagen type I α 1 chain; COL1a2, collagen type I α2 chain.
