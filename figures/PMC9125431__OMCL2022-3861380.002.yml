caption: LDH rat DRG tissues RNA-Seq analysis. (a) PCA of DRG tissues in LDH rats.
  The dot represents the sample. Different colors represent different groups. (b)
  Differential gene volcano map in DRG tissues of LDH rats. Red dots represent upregulated
  genes, and green dots represent downregulated genes. (c) Differential gene heat
  map of DRG tissues in LDH rats. Red indicates high expression, and blue represents
  low expression. (d) GO functional enrichment analysis of the differential genes.
  The ordinate is GO term, and the abscissa is the number of differential genes in
  the GO term. The longer the annotation bar represents, the greater the number of
  differential genes. (e) Top 20 KEGG enrichment of the differential gene. Red indicates
  high expression, and blue represents low expression. The ordinate is the pathway,
  and the abscissa is the enrichment factor (the number of differences in the pathway
  is divided by all the numbers). The size of the circle indicates the number. The
  redder the color, the smaller the P or Q value. The redder and the bigger the bubble,
  the more differential genes are enriched in the pathway. (f) Heat map reflected
  metabolism, inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis-related gene expression.
