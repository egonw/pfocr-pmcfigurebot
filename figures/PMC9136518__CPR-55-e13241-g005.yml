caption: RR‐171 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the growth of various tumour cells
  in vitro, especially liver cancer cells. (A) QSG‐7701, Hep3B and MHCC97H cell lines
  were incubated with RR‐170 or RR‐171 at different concentrations. The cell viability
  was measured by CCK8 assay. (B,C) After treatment with RR‐170 or RR‐171, the proliferation
  rate of HCC cell lines was tested by CCK‐8 assay at different time points (0, 0.1,
  1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h). (D,E) The percentage of FITC‐positive cells was detected
  by flow cytometry assay in HCC cell lines treated with RR‐171 at different time
  points (0, 0.1, 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h). The data are presented as the mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
article_title: Tubulin‐binding peptide RR‐171 derived from human umbilical cord serum
  displays antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma via inducing apoptosis
  and activating the NF‐kappa B pathway.
