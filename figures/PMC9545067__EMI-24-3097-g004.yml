caption: 'Maximum likelihood tree and nitrogen pathways of archaeal genomes. AOA genomes
  from RefSeq were phylogenetically compared to the potential AOA MAGs recovered from
  this study (indicated by bold labels). Completeness of MAGs was reported by CheckM.
  Nitrogen pathways displayed were predicted by MinPath using the KEGG metabolic pathway
  models and are represented by shaded boxes indicating the predicted presence of
  a node within the respective nitrogen metabolic pathway. Shaded stars are nodes
  that were not present in the MinPath prediction but were detected via HMM search
  using the Pfam A database. Bootstrap values of ≥95% are shown by solid dots. Coloured
  backgrounds indicate AOA groups: Marine Group I (MG‐I); South African Gold Mine
  Crenarchaeotic Group 1 (SAGMCG‐1); Soil Crenarchaeotic Group (SCG); Hot Water Crenarchaeotic
  Group III (HWCGIII) and Thermophilic AOA (ThAOA).'
