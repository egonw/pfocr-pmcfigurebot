caption: Summary of targeting and delivering therapies on atherosclerosis treatment.
  To resolve the limitations in the efficacy and safety of existing treatment methods
  of atherosclerosis, biological drugs with improved targeting are currently being
  explored. One of the most promising directions is to target lipoprotein metabolism.
  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), vaccines, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based gene
  therapy, genome/base editing technologies and viral-mediated gene therapy are all
  cutting-edge therapeutic approaches that target lipoprotein metabolism. Another
  advanced therapy strategy is to delivery natural or synthetic lipoproteins for the
  treatment of atherosclerosis. Reconstituted (r) HDL has been widely accepted as
  an ideal drug delivery vehicle, because of their nano-size, unique cellular uptake
  mechanism via a non-endocytic pathway. Synthetic HDL (sHDL), using a nanoparticle
  template to tailor the structure and the chemical composition of the HDLs, is featured
  with improved size, shape and surface chemistry and with less batch-to-batch variation.
  Biomaterials combined with r/s HDL may have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. LDL could
  be applied as a vesicle to delivery targeted therapeutic drugs.
