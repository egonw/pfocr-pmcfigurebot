caption: 'Aastragaloside IV-PESV can affect PCa gut microbiota. A. Images of each
  group of nude mice and their tumors. B. Body weight. C. Plots of tumor volume change
  over four weeks. D. Tumor mass of each group. E. HE staining of tumor tissue of
  each group. F. Rand-Abandance curves showed the species richness of each group.
  G. Differences between species abundance of each group. H. Differences in the composition
  of groups of colonies by principal component analysis. I. Groups of colonies that
  differed more at the Phylum level. J. Bacteria that differed more among groups at
  the Genus level. K. KEGG was to analyse of pathway correlation heat map for four
  groups of enrichment. *, P < 0.05 compared with the Control group. #, P < 0.05 compared
  with the PESV group'
