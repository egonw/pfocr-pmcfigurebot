caption: GLI3 variants led to truncated or degraded of GLI3 protein and decreased
  Shh expression. (a) The location of p.Y576X and p.R792X variants within GLI3 protein.
  (b) Comparison of the partial amino acid sequence of human GLI3 with other species.
  The boxed amino acid indicates the conserved residue across different species. (c)
  Western blotting analysis of the ectopic expression of GLI3 wild‐type and mutant
  plasmids in HEK293T cells. (d) qPCR analysis of the Shh expression of GLI3 wild‐type
  and mutant plasmids in limb bud cells (n = 3) *p < .05 (Student’s t‐test). N.S.,
  not significant. Data are presented as mean ± SD
article_title: Two nonsense GLI3 variants are associated with polydactyly and syndactyly
  in two families by affecting the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.
