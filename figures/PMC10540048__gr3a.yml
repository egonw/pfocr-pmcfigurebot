caption: IRIN plus radiation therapy significantly increased antigen presentation
  and PD-L1 expression level in CRC cells (A) (C) The expression levels of PD-L1 (A)
  and MHC-I (C) in HCT8 cells with different treatments were analyzed by flow cytometry.
  IgG group represented control cells that were stained with isotype IgG. Negative
  control group represented control cells that were stained with PD-L1 or MHC-I antibody.
  Radiation group represented cells irradiated with 4 Gy X-rays that were stained
  with PD-L1 or MHC-I antibody. IRIN group represented cells treated with 3 μM IRIN
  that were stained with PD-L1 or MHC-I antibody. IRIN plus radiation group represented
  cells treated with 3 μM IRIN and 4 Gy X-rays that were stained with PD-L1 or MHC-I
  antibody. (B) (D) Quantitation of fluorescent intensity of PD-L1 (B) and MHC-I (D).
  Data were presented as the mean ± SD obtained from three independent experiments.
  (E–G) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression level of IFN-α (E), IFN-β (F), ISG15 (G).
  (H–I) ELISA assays of IFN-α (H) and IFN-β (I) level in the supernatant. (J–K) qRT-PCR
  analysis of the expression level of NLRC5 (J) and TAP1 (K). Data were presented
  as the mean ± SD obtained from three independent experiments. (J) Representative
  Western blot images of β2M. Quantitation of β2M protein level was performed by ImageJ
  software. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (One-way ANOVA, followed
  by Tukey's test).
