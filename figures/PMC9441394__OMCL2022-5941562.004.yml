caption: Overexpression of EID3 enhances invasion, migration, and chemoresistance
  of osteosarcoma cells. (a) Transwell assay of the invasion of MG-63-EID3 and MG-63-Vector
  cells. (b) Wound healing assay of the migration of MG-63-EID3 and MG-63-Vector cells.
  (c) Cells were treated with various concentrations of DOX for 48 h. Cell proliferation
  was measured by CCK-8 assay. Data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗,
  p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001.
