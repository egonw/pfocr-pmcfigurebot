caption: G‐protein signalling pathway. Schematic showing the canonical stimulatory
  G‐protein (Gs) pathway for melanocortin 4‐receptor (MC4R) signalling and gene expression.
  Binding of α‐melanocyte‐stimulating hormone (MSH) to the MC4R causes the activation
  of the G‐protein, with αßγ‐subunits dissociating into α‐/ßγ‐subunits. The dissociated
  Gαs causes the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), leading to the conversion of
  ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates inactive protein kinase
  A (PKA) which is translocated into the nucleus, activating the transcription factor
  cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) via phosphorylation of CREB, which
  regulates transcription. GTP, guanosine triphosphate
