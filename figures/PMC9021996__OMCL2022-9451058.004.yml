caption: miR-1a-3p mediated atherosclerotic process in vitro. (a) The relative expression
  of miR-1a-3p after treatment with ox-LDL and different concentrations of EPA (0 μM,
  50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, 400 μM, 600 μM, and 800 μM) evaluated by qRT–PCR (normalized
  to U6) (n = 3 per group). (b) Representative images of ORO staining and the percentage
  of foam cells, showing that miR-1a-3p mediated foam cell formation. Approximately
  1000 cells were counted per treatment over six separate experiments. (c) WB results
  of NLRP3 and IL-1β after ox-LDL treatment and miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor transfection
  (n = 3 per group). (d) The intracellular ROS levels detected by flow cytometry after
  ox-LDL treatment and miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor transfection (n = 3 per group). (e)
  The level of GPx in macrophages treated with ox-LDL and ox-LDL + 200 μM EPA treatment
  (n = 3 per group). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and∗∗∗p < 0.001.
