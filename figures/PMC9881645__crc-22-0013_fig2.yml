caption: DDR2 is a commonly regulated RTK by FOXQ1 and SNAI1-controlled EMT programs.
  A–C, GSEA of the 2,201 genes commonly dysregulated in HMLE/FOXQ1, and HMLE/SNAI1
  cells (both upregulated and downregulated) reveals enrichment of hallmark EMT functions
  (A) and glycolysis (B). LacZ control cells exhibited enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation
  (C). Class 1 represents HMLE/FOXQ1 and HMLE/SNAI1 samples, which class 2 represents
  HMLE/LacZ samples. D, Plot of the log2 fold change in expression for HMLE/FOXQ1
  and HMLE/SNAI1 cells, relative to respective HMLE/LacZ control counterparts. Spearman
  correlation coefficient is reported. E, The FOXQ1-SNAI1 1,042 upregulated gene signature
  was assessed for the RTK coexpression signature from the ARCHS4 database. F, REACTOME
  pathway enrichment analysis of the 1,042 genes that are commonly upregulated in
  HMLE/FOXQ1 and HMLE/SNAI1 cell models. G, The expression profile of 48 RTKs by qRT-PCR
  identified a set of RTKs commonly regulated by FOXQ1 and SNAI1 in the respective
  HMLE models. H, Western blot analysis shows several RTKs were upregulated in HMLE
  cells with ectopic expression of FOXQ1 and SNAI1. β-actin was used as a protein
  loading control.
