caption: Potential regulatory mechanism of the OsCBL8-OsCIPK17 module. Calcium signaling
  begins with OsCBL8, which is located in the cell membrane, binds to calcium and
  then enforces OsCIPK17 and binds to it. OsCIPK17 may further regulate the growth
  and development of seedlings by interacting with some unknown target genes. This
  pathway is also regulated by ABA. ABA initially binds to the corresponding receptor
  protein (PYR/PYL/RCAR). The receptor protein with ABA further binds to OsPP2C77
  and transmits the signal to it. Subsequently, OsPP2C77 dephosphorylates OsCIPK17
  to inhibit its regulation of downstream targets. OsCBL8-OsCIPK17 can also endow
  seedlings with high temperature resistance. OsCIPK17 can phosphorylate the transcription
  factor OsNAC77 involved in stress response. OsNAC77 combines with the DNA-specific
  sequences that are located in the promoter region of OsCLPD1 and OsOAT to give seedlings
  the ability to resist heat stress. Meanwhile, OsCIPK17 can phosphorylate the JA-mediated
  transcription factor OsJAMYB. OsJAMYB can bind to the promoter of OsAGO18 to activate
  its transcription, so as to promote rice antiviral defense. In addition, OsCBL8
  may regulate seed germination by interacting with other OsCIPK. The dotted line
  indicates that this process is speculative.
