caption: 'Effects of CTN on liver injury in mice. (A) Body weight, liver weight, and
  liver coefficient of mice exposed to different doses of CTN. (B) Evaluation of liver
  histopathological damage (Blue arrows indicate hepatic cord disorder, red arrows
  indicate hepatocyte swelling, and green arrows indicate dissolution. Scale bar:
  20 μm). (C) Ultramicrostructure observation of liver tissue (red arrows indicate
  expansion of endoplasmic reticulum. Scale bar: 2 μm and 1 μm). The above data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM. Compared with the control group, * p < 0.05.'
