caption: P. gingivalis infection upregulates TGFβ activity in ESCC. (A) Histogram
  showing the differentially expressed mRNAs in KYSE30 cells in response to P. gingivalis
  challenge; (B) Pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed mRNAs based
  on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database; (C) The expression levels
  of total and active TGFβ1 secreted by NE6-T and KYSE30 cells under different treatment
  conditions were detected by ELISA; (D) The activity of a TGFβ-responsive Smad-binding
  element (SBE) luciferase reporter in NE6-T or KYSE30 cells 24 h post P. gingivalis
  infection; (E) Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and Smad7 mRNA expression
  levels in NE6-T and KYSE30 cells under different treatment conditions as determined
  by Real-time PCR; (F) The expression levels of pSmad2/3 and total Smad2/3 in NE6-T
  and KYSE30 cells under different treatment conditions as determined by Western blot;
  (G) Representative confocal immunofluorescence images and quantitation of Oct4 and
  Smad2/3 in NE6-T and KYSE30 cells under different treatment conditions. Scale bars,
  50 µm. Except (A and B), all experiments were independently repeated three times.
  The quantitation data in (C-E) were presented as means ± SD from three independent
  experiment with a two-tailed Student’s t-test for statistical analysis (*P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001).
