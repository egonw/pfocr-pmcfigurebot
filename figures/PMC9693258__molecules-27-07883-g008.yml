caption: 'Effects of AaEA-H on regulating the key proteins of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  pathway (n = 3). Western blot analysis of protein expressions of TLR4, MyD88, p-IκB,
  IκB, p-IKK, IKK, and NF-κB p65 (A). TLR4 level normalized with β-Actin (B). MyD88
  level normalized with β-Actin (C). The ratio of p-IKK protein expression level to
  IKK protein expression level (D). The ratio of p-IκB protein expression level to
  IκB protein expression level (E). NF-κB p65 level normalized with β-Actin (F). Unless
  indicated, no significant difference was observed between groups. Compared with
  control group, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001. Compared with ConA group, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.'
