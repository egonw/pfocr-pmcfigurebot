caption: Effect of hsa-miR-200c expression on the glutathione (GSH) pathway and cell
  death. In vitro long-term effect of hsa-miR-200c expression. (A,B) GSH/GSSG assay
  in MCF7 wt vs. KO 200c, MCF7 Tripz 200c sponge and MDA-MB 231 Tripz 200c (doxorubicin
  left, cisplatin right). Total GSH and GSSG were measured after 24 h of DXR or CP
  treatment (0.1 μM DXR for MCF7 and 0.6 μM DXR and 50 μM CP for MDA-MB 231 cells).
  Tripz-constructs were pre-incubated with 5 μg/mL doxycycline or not for 72 h before
  chemotherapeutic treatment. (C,D) PI assay analysis using propidium iodide (PI)
  and measurement of subG1 population in MCF7 wt vs. KO 200c, MCF7 Tripz 200c sponge
  and MDA-MB 231 Tripz 200c. Either an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, an ordinary
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test or a 2 way ANOVA with Šídák’s
  or Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed for statistics. One representative
  replicate out of three is shown. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p
  < 0.0001. Values are displayed as mean with SD. (E) Confluency monitoring and corresponding
  (F) colony formation of MDA-MB 231 Tripz 200c cells induced (orange lines) or not
  (black lines) with DOX (every 48 to 72 h) and single treatment with 0.1 μM DXR at
  80% of confluency.
