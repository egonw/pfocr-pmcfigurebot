caption: LTP induced CALU-1 cell death via VEGF/VEGFR2/RAS/ERK axis. (a) The expressions
  of key proteins in this signaling pathway were assessed by Western Blot analysis,
  (b) the data were quantitated and graphed. Data represent the means Â± SD of three
  independent experiments, compared with 0 s LTP treatment time group. * p < 0.05;
  *** p < 0.001; compared with the 0 s LTP treatment group.
