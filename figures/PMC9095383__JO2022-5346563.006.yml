caption: KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis. (a) Bubble chart of KEGG enrichment
  analysis on cancer-related pathways in which the target genes had a role (P < 0.05
  and P < 0.05 after correction). (b) Column chart of the quantity level of the target
  genes on cancer-related pathways. (c) Distribution of KEGG pathway annotations.
  (dâ€“f) GO analysis on the enrichment classes of the target genes in biological processes,
  cellular constituents, and molecular functions.
