caption: Alexander staining of anthers after 24 h of ethylene treatment. (A–I) Alexander
  staining of stage 5 to stage 12 anthers after 24 h treatment with ethylene (100
  µL L−1). Bars = 50 µm. After ethylene treatment, plants were transferred to normal
  condition for further growth. The flower buds in the inflorescence gradually mature,
  and Alexander staining was carried out to stain the anthers of each mature flower.
