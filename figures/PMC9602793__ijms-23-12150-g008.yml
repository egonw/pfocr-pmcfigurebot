caption: Transcriptome profiling of transgenic flowers. (A) Number of DEGs in transgenic
  flowers. (B) The MEP pathway responsible for the formation of terpenes in plants,
  and qRT-PCR validation of expression patterns of candidate genes in the MEP pathway.
  Relative expression levels of the selected genes were analyzed by qRT-RCR using
  OfRAN as an internal control. (C) Information of top 10 enriched KEGG terms according
  to p-value.
