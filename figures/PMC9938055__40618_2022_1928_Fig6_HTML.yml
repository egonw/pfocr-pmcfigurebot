caption: CSNK2A1 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of thyroid
  cancer cells through PI3K–Akt pathway. A, B Knockdown of CSNK2A1 by siRNA, RT-qPCR
  at mRNA level and western blot at protein level. Effect of CSNK2A1 on the proliferative
  capacity of thyroid cancer cell lines assessed by clony formation assay (C) and
  EdU assay(D scale bar:1 mm). Effect of CSNK2A1 on migration and invasive ability
  of thyroid cancer cell lines assessed by transwell (E scale bar:100 μm) and scratch
  assays (F scale bar:100 μm). G Effect of circNDST1 on the expression of essential
  proteins of EMT process in TPC1 cells by Western blot. H Effect of circNDST1 on
  the expression of essential proteins of PI3K–Akt pathway in TPC1 cells by Western
  blot. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Data are shown as SD ± mean
article_title: CircNDST1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer progression via its interaction
  with CSNK2A1 to activate the PI3K–Akt pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
