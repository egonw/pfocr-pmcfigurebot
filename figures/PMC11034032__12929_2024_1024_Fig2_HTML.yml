  our DEGs (A) Chemokine mediated signal pathway and cell migration on biological
  process (BP) (B) Cytolytic granule on cellular component (CC) (C) Ig binding, platelet
  derived growth factor receptor binding and chemokine activity on molecular function

  obtained from the STRING database showed cytotoxicity signature, antigen presentation
  and chemokine-cytokine interaction influence the pathogenesis of advanced LN
