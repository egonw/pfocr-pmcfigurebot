caption: 'CD155 promotes proliferation, migration and invasion, and reduces apoptosis
  of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro. (A) mRNA and protein expression
  levels of CD155 in HCC cell lines were detected by RT‐PCR and Western blot (WB)
  assays; t‐tests were used. (B) Efficiencies of CD155 knockdown and overexpression
  were validated by RT‐PCR and WB assays; t‐tests were used. (C and D) Influence of
  CD155 on HCC cell proliferation was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit‐8 and colony
  formation assays; t‐tests were used. (E) Influence of CD155 on HCC cell cycle was
  evaluated by flow cytometry; t‐tests were used. (F and G) Influence of CD155 on
  HCC cell migration and invasion was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays;
  t‐tests were used. Scale bar: 100 μm. (H) Influence of CD155 on HCC cell apoptosis
  was evaluated by flow cytometry; t‐tests were used. Error bars represent the standard
  error of mean (SEM) from at least three independent experiments. *p < .05; **p < .01;
  ***p < .001'
