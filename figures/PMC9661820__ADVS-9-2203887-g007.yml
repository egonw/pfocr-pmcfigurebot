caption: 'Hyperspectral SRS imaging unveils chemical aggregates inside limonene‐producing
  E. coli. a) Spontaneous Raman spectra of limonene, geraniol, prenol, isoprenol,
  GT (glycerol trioleate), and BSA (bovine serum albumin) in the fingerprint window
  (600–1800 cm−1). Spectra of geraniol, prenol, and isoprenol represent the spectra
  of precursors in limonene synthesis pathway (GPP, DMAPP, and IPP). b) Spontaneous
  Raman spectra of limonene, geraniol, prenol, isoprenol, GT, and BSA in the C—H window.
  The spectra of GT and BSA were included to show that neither protein nor fatty acids
  inside the cells have a significant contribution to the 760 cm−1 Raman peak. Red
  arrows denote peaks at Raman shift 760 cm−1 (limonene), 774 cm−1 (prenol), and 767 cm−1
  (isoprenol). c) Spectrally summed hSRS images of BW25113 strain (fingerprint window).
  Left: wild‐type; Right: limonene‐producing strain. White arrows denote the position
  of the intracellular aggregates. d) Average of the normalized spectra of the wild‐type
  strain, aggregate of limonene‐producing strain, and non‐aggregating part of limonene‐producing
  strain. Red arrow marks 760 cm−1 Raman peak. Shaded error bar: std. e) Scatter plot
  of the Raman intensity at 760 cm−1 per region of the normalized spectra in (d).
  The solid green, blue, and red lines were averaged by 68 cells, 33 cells, 4 aggregates
  respectively. NS, nonsignificant, P > 0.05. *, 10−5 < P < 0.05 (Wilcoxon rank sum
  test). f) Spectrally summed hSRS images of BW25113 strain (C—H window). Left: wild‐type;
  Right: limonene‐producing strain. g) Average of the raw spectra of the wild‐type
  strain, aggregates of limonene‐producing strain, and non‐aggregating part of limonene‐producing
  strain. Red arrow marks 2930 cm−1 Raman peak. h) Average of the normalized spectra
  of wild‐type strain, aggregates of limonene‐producing strain, and non‐aggregating
  part of limonene‐producing strain. Red arrow marks 2930 cm−1 Raman peak. Shaded
  error bar: std.'
