caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  of DEGs. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in GUIGE8; (B) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of DEGs in GUIGE18. The colors are shaded according to the p-value
  level, as shown in the color bars gradually changing from low (red) to high (blue).
  The size of the circle indicates the number of DEGs from small (less) to big (more).
  The larger the rich factor, the higher the GO enrichment degree.
