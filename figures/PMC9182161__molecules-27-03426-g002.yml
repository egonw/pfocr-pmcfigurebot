caption: 'The signaling pathways of HIF-1α inhibitors and their actions. HIF-1α inhibitors
  mainly inhibit HIF-1α activity through the following mechanisms: (1) influence the
  degradation of HIF-1α; (2) inhibit the DNA transcription and expression of HIF-1α;
  (3) block the translation activity of mRNA; (4) hinder HIF-1α binding with HRE;
  (5) impede the formation of HIF-1α transcription complex; and (6) inhibit HIF-1α
  upstream pathway. Dashed arrows indicate the response under normoxia, solid arrows
  indicate the response under hypoxia, green arrows indicate the regulation mechanism
  of HIF-1a self-activity, and black arrows indicate the regulation mechanism of signaling
  pathway.'
