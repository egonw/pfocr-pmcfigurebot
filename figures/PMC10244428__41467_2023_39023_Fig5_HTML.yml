  pathway
caption: a, b Naïve CD4+ T cells from WT and Ghrhrlit/lit mice were cultured in Th17
  polarizing condition for 3 days. a 10 μg/ml of anti-GHRH, anti-GH or anti-IGF-1
  antibodies were added to cells for 3 days. The frequency of IL-17A+CD4+ T cells
  was determined by flow cytometry (n = 6 independent experiments). The F value of
  one-way ANOVA test is 36.15, and the corresponding p value is less than 0.0001.
  The exact p values (IL-6 + TGFβ WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit, anti-GH WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit,
  and anti-IGF-1 WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit) were 1.43 × 10−7, 8.24 × 10−11, and 7.07 × 10−9
  respectively. b DMSO, hGHRH, MR-409, or MIA-602 were added to cells for 3 days.
  The frequency of IL-17A+CD4+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry (n = 6 independent
  experiments). The F value of the one-way ANOVA test is 79.74, and the corresponding
  p value is less than 0.0001. The exact p values (DMSO WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit, hGHRH
  WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit, and MR-409 WT vs Ghrhrlit/lit) were 2.35 × 10−7, 1.63 × 10−12,
  and 4.71 × 10−13, respectively. c Naïve CD4+ T cells from WT and Ghrhrlit/lit mice
  were activated for 3 days in Th17 polarizing condition, washed, and serum-starved
  for 4 h and then re-stimulated with MR-409 for 60 min. Expression of Il17a, Il17f,
  Il22, Il23r, Rorc, Rora, Hif1a, Il10, Irf4, and Batf was quantified (n = 8 independent
  experiments). Data were normalized to Gapdh and fold change is relative to Ghrhrlit/lit.
  d Naïve CD4+ T cells from WT and Ghrhrlit/lit mice were labeled with CellTrace dye
  (CFSE). Cells were cultured in Th17 polarizing condition with or without MR-409
  for 3 days (n = 6 independent experiments). e Then cells were treated with or without
  ruxolitinib (1 μM) for 4 h. MR-409 and MIA-602 were then added to cells for 30 min.
  Expression of phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 in CD4+IL-17+ T cells was quantified
  (n = 6 independent experiments). The F value of the one-way ANOVA test is 17.77,
  and the corresponding p value is less than 0.0001. f MR-409 was treated to cells
  for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. Expression of phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 in CD4+IL-17+
  T cells was quantified (n = 6 independent experiments). The F value of the one-way
  ANOVA test is 17.38, and the corresponding p value is less than 0.0001. g Naïve
  CD4+ T cells from WT and Ghrhrlit/lit mice were cultured for 3 days in Th17 polarizing
  condition in the presence of MR-409 with or without ruxolitinib (1 μM) or Stattic
  (1 μM) for 3 days. The frequency of IL-17A+CD4+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry
  (n = 6 independent experiments). The F value of the one-way ANOVA test is 67.11,
  and the corresponding p value is less than 0.0001. The exact p values (WT + DMSO
  vs WT + MR-409, WT + MR-409 vs WT + MR-409+Rux, and WT + MR-409 vs WT + MR-409+Stattic)
  were 7.62 × 10−6, 1 × 10−15, and 1 × 10−15 respectively. Data were the representation
  of at least two independent experiments. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. Two-sided
  student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction (c) and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post hoc test (a, b, e–g). *, **, and **** represent  < 0.05,  < 0.01, and  < 0.0001,
  respectively. ns represents no significant difference.
