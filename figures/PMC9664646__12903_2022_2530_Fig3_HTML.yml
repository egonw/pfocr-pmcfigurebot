caption: 'Schematic representation of anti-virulence strategies covered under this
  review. 1. Targeting virulence factor: (a) Protease Inhibitors: Microbial protease
  plays an essential role in the progression of periodontal diseases and thus could
  be a potential therapeutic target. The therapeutic approach focused on Gingipain
  inhibitor (Kgp specific inhibitor A71561) can significantly decrease virulence.
  (b) LPS inhibition: Cell surface components like LPS could be targeted for treating
  periodontal diseases. α-Tocopherol reduces inflammatory cytokines while increasing
  antimicrobial peptides, and β-defensins, thereby counteracting the damaging effects
  of LPS, which play a vital role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. (c)
  Inhibition of fimbrial assembly: Fimbriae are a major structural component of periodontal
  bacteria. Studies have shown that peptides originating from the conserved C-terminal
  of FimA and Mfa1 subunits prevent the fimbrial assembly of P. gingivalis and interfere
  with biofilm formation. (d) Targeting IL-1β as a potential therapy: It has been
  shown that the capsular polysaccharide upregulates the expression of IL 1-β by activating
  the JNK pathway in macrophages. Increased IL 1- β levels lead to inflammation and
  bone resorption, indicating a possible therapeutic strategy to combat this periodontal
  pathogen. (e) Toxin inhibition by receptor-based peptide: A. actinomycetemcomitans,
  associated with periodontal disease, produces leukotoxin (LtxA) during colonization
  in the host to escape the host immune response. LtxA is the critical virulence factor
  of A. actinomycetemcomitans, which kills leukocytes by recognizing cholesterol and
  the β2 strands of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin. Molecular
  inhibitors mimic the target to compete for toxin binding, thus neutralizing toxin
  binding activity. Small synthetic receptor-specific peptides can hinder LtxA-mediated
  cytotoxicity by binding to the β domain of transmembrane protein LFA-1. 2. Targeting
  quorum sensing signalling: QS is the most distributed and studied bacterial communication,
  which helps periodontal bacteria communicate with each other through signalling
  molecules and behaviour coordination. Various compounds can block quorum-sensing
  signals produced by periodontal pathogens, thus inhibiting the disease progression
  pathway'
