caption: Graphical summary that explains underlying mechanism of acquired resistance
  to ICIs in terms of tumor cell-intrinsic and tumor cell-extrinsic factors. Tumor
  intrinsic mechanisms of acquired resistance involve loss of immunogenic antigens,
  defects in antigen processing and presentation, and mutations of IFN‐γ/JAK signaling
  pathway. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms of acquired resistance mainly include activation
  of alternate inhibitory immune checkpoints, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment,
  epigenetic modification, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome

  potential strategies based on molecular mechanisms.'
