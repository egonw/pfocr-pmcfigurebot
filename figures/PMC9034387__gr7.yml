caption: 'Low expression of TSPAN31 can partially reverse the inhibitory effect of
  high expression of CCT2 on the malignant phenotype of GC cells. (A) The mRNA expression
  of CCT2 after GC cells were co-transfected with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31 was determined
  by qRT-PCR. (B) The OD value of GC cells co-transfected with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31
  was measured at 450 nm by the CCK-8 assay. (C) The clonogenic of GC cells co-transfected
  with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31 was determined by the clone formation assay. (D) The
  lateral migration capacity of GC cells co-transfected with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31
  was measured by the wound healing assay (magnification: 100×). (E) The longitudinal
  migration capacity of GC cells co-transfected with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31 was determined
  by the Transwell assay (magnification: 100×). (F) The apoptosis level of GC cells
  co-transfected with CCT2 OE and shTSPAN31 was determined by the apoptosis assay
  (*P < 0.05; ⁎⁎P < 0.01; ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001).'
