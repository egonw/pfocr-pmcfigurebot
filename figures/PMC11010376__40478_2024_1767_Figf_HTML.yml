caption: 'Regulation of macroglia reactivity in response to ocular hypertension. (A)
  Representative immunofluorescence images of GFAP (green) at 2 weeks, and (B) GFAP
  (green) RBPMS (red) at 8 weeks of ocular hypertension. Nuclei were labeled with
  DAPI. All images were obtained using a 40x objective. Scale bar = 50 μm. Labels:
  ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer nuclear layer (ONL).
  (C) Representative images of a portion of flat-mounted retinas stained with GFAP
  (green) at 8 weeks. (D) Muller glia reactivity gene, GLAST, was analyzed by qPCR
  at 2 and 4 weeks. The results were normalized to GAPDH. (E) Astrocyte markers were
  significantly upregulated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks when analyzed by qPCR. The results
  were normalized to GAPDH and controls. n = 4 (2 retinas were pooled for each replicate).
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, **p < 0.001. (Ctrl- Control; OHT- ocular hypertension)'
