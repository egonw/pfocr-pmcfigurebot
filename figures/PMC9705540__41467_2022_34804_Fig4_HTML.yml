figure_title: Dlx5-creER+ early perichondrial cells regulate marrow formation in response
  to Hedgehog signaling
caption: 'a–f CellChat intercellular communication analysis of the E13.5 Col2a1-cre-marked
  chondrocyte and perichondrial cell scRNA-seq dataset. a Outgoing and incoming interaction
  strength of signaling pathways. Each circle represents the number of interactions
  a cluster participates in. (Left): Cluster 1 has a low tendency to send signals
  but a high tendency to receive signals in overall pathways. (Right): Cluster 1 exhibits
  a high propensity to both send and receive signals via the Hh pathways. Dotted box:
  UMAP-based plot and cluster labels of the E13.5 scRNA-seq data. b Feature plots
  of Ihh and Ptch1. Violet: high expression, yellow: low expression. c Violin plots
  displaying the expression distribution of Ihh and Ptch1 in each cluster. d Chord
  diagram shows the signals linking Cluster 1 and other clusters via the Hh pathway.
  e Heatmap represents the relative importance of each cluster. Dark green: higher
  importance, white: lower importance. Cluster 1 is scored as the dominant sender,
  receiver, and influencer of the Ihh-Ptch1 signaling pathway. Cluster 5 is measured
  as a dominant receiver. f Hierarchical plot showing the intercellular interactions
  of the chondrocyte-perichondrial cell lineage via the Ihh-Ptch1 signaling pathway.
  g Functional analysis of Hedgehog signaling in Dlx5-creER+ early perichondrial cells
  and Fgfr3-creER+ fetal chondrocytes in bone marrow development. Left panels: Histological
  images of Dlx5-creER; Ptch1fl/+; R26RtdTomato (Dlx5-Control), Dlx5-creER; Ptch1fl/fl;
  R26RtdTomato (Dlx5-Ptch1 cKO), Fgfr3-creER; Ptch1fl/+; R26RtdTomato (Fgfr3-Control),
  Fgfr3-creER; Ptch1fl/fl; R26RtdTomato (Fgfr3-Ptch1 cKO), femur at E18.5 (pulsed
  at E12.5). Scale bar: 500 μm. n = 8 (Dlx5-Control), n = 11 (Dlx5-Ptch1 cKO), n = 10
  (Fgfr3-Control), n = 8 (Dlx5-Ptch1 cKO) mice per each group. Right panels: quantification
  of whole femur length (top left), bone marrow length per total bone length (middle
  left), distal cartilage length per total bone length (bottom left), Col1a1-GFP+
  trabecular area per total bone marrow area (top right), number of chondrocytes per
  column (middle right) and total number of columns in growth plate (bottom right).
  n = 8 (Dlx5-Control), n = 11 (Dlx5-Ptch1 cKO), n = 10 (Fgfr3-Control), n = 8 (Dlx5-Ptch1
  cKO) mice per group. Two-tailed, Mann–Whitney’s U test. Data are presented as mean ± s.d.
