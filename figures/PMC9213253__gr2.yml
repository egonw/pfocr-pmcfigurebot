caption: 'Detection of intermediates of the CoA biosynthesis pathway in wildtype and
  ΔpanD Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 strains. Metabolomic analysis of cells grown in
  minimal medium devoid of β-alanine. LC/MS/MS analyses were conducted on a QTRAP
  5500 using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)–based approach. DAP and 3AP were
  analyzed using a C18 BEH column after derivatization with benzoyl chloride and FMOC,
  respectively. β-alanine and pantothenate were analyzed through a ZIC-pHILIC column.
  A and B, comparison of DAP and 3AP contents, respectively. C and D, comparison of
  β-alanine and pantothenate contents, respectively. DAP, 3AP, β-alanine, and pantothenate
  were identified according to the chromatographic retention time and fragmentation
  pattern of their corresponding standards ( and ). For DAP and 3AP, data correspond
  to six and five independent metabolite extractions for each strain, respectively.
  For β-alanine and pantothenate, data correspond to 10 extractions. The values shown
  correspond to automatic peak integration for the following mass transitions: DAP,
  m/z 283.1 → 104.9; 3AP, m/z 296.0 → 179.0; β-alanine: m/z 90.0 → 71.9); and pantothenate,
  m/z 218.1 → 87.9. Only the values for β-alanine in ΔpanD were close to the detection
  limit (). Indicated are p values from Welch''s t test. 3AP, 3-aminopropanal; DAP,
  1,3-diaminopropane; FMOC, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride.'
