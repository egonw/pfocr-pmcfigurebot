caption: Motor response of zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf in relation to THC concentration;
  locomotor activity of 6-days-old post-fertilization vehicle control larvae (n =
  79) and exposed to 1 mg/L (n = 67), 1.25 mg/L (n = 140), 1.5 mg/L (n = 44) and 2
  mg/L (n = 45) were monitored in a 30-min period of dark/light cycling (0–10 min,
  dark; 10–20 min, light [white area]; 20–30 min, dark); the distance was measured
  at intervals of 2 min and was compared with the vehicle control.
