caption: Time‐lapse images of B. subtilis PproHJ‐sfGFP (Sp) exposed to 0.6 M NaCl
  showing heterogeneity in proHJ transcription. Micrographs of time‐lapse microscopy
  showing adaptation of B. subtilis to 0.6 M NaCl exposure at indicated time points.
  Only one cell becomes fluorescent after an initial lag time and resumes growth and
  division. The non‐fluorescent cells, marked with yellow arrows, could not divide
  and remain dormant throughout the 12 h of exposure to sustained osmostress.
