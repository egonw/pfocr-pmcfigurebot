caption: Landscape of metabolic gene expression in bronchoalveolar immune cells from
  patients with COVID-19 at single-cell level(A) A flowchart depicting the overall
  design of the study.(B–D) A schematic diagram shows principal component analysis
  (PCA) (B) and t-SNE visualization of subpopulations (C and D) in BALFs of healthy
  controls (HCs, n = 4), mild COVID-19 (n = 3), and severe COVID-19 (n = 6) donors
  based on all gene expression profiles.(E–G) A schematic diagram shows PCA (E) and
  t-SNE plot of metabolic genes expression profiles (F-G) of cells from BALFs based
  on 1,526 metabolic gene expressions. Different colors indicate distinct cell subsets
  (C and F) and patient groups (D and G). Cell subset identity in F was defined by
  using all variable genes.(H) Feature plots show expression of cell-subset marker
  genes and indicated metabolic genes of macrophages, mDC, T cells, plasma cells,
  and epithelial cells from BALFs of HC and patients with COVID-19.(I and J) GSEA
  summarizing metabolic pathway alterations of indicated subpopulations in mild versus
  HC (I) and patients with severe versus mild (J) COVID-19. A pathway was included
  in the heatmap if there was an alteration with pvalue less than 0.1 in any cell
  type.
