figure_title: MCR-induced ferroptosis by inhibited GPX4 expression in ESCC
caption: A–F The expressions of ferroptosis-related indexes in ECA109 and EC9706 cell
  lines were detected in control group, 10 μM group and 20 μM group. For 10 μM group
  or 20 μM group, 10 μM or 20 μM methionine was added into methionine/cystine-deficient
  medium, respectively. Cells were cultured for 72 h, and the content of Fe2+ (A,
  D), GSH (B, E), and MDA (C, F) in cell lysates was detected by ELISA. n = 5 for
  each group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t
  test. G, H The content of MDA (G) and the TUNEL-positive cells (H) were detected
  respectively in (1) control+DMSO group; (2) control+Fer-1 group; (3) MCR + DMSO
  group; (4) MCR+Fer-1 group. n = 5 for each group, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t test. I The expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 were detected in
  ESCC cells under MCR condition and transfected with SLC43A2 siRNA by western blot.
  J Western blot was used to detect the GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression in (1) DMSO+ddH2O
  group; (2) Bay 11-7082+ddH2O group; (3) Bay 11-7082 + 30 μM group. K The protein
  level of Bax and Bcl-2 were detected respectively in (1) control+DMSO group; (2)
  Bay 11-7082 + DMSO group; (3) Bay 11-7082+Fer-1 group. L, M The TUNEL-positive cells
  (L) and the content of MDA (M) were detected, respectively, in (1) control+DMSO
  group; (2) Bay 11-7082 + DMSO group; (3) Bay 11-7082+Fer-1 group. n = 5 for each
  group, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 5).
