caption: Role of DEAD/H-box proteins in programmed cell death. DDX3X forms an anti-apoptotic
  complex with cIAP and GSK3 that blocks extrinsic apoptosis induced by ligands, such
  as TNF, TRAIL, and FASL binding to death receptors. Signals that induce apoptosis
  target DDX3X for caspase-8 (CASP8)-mediated degradation. Several DEAD/H-box proteins
  have been reported to drive pyroptosis—a pro-inflammatory programmed cell death
  pathway. DDX3X is critically important for the activation of the canonical NLRP3
  inflammasome downstream of potassium ion efflux, as well as potassium-independent
  mechanisms. Another DEAD/H-box protein that is involved in triggering NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation is DHX33. DHX33 acts as a sensor of virus-derived dsRNA, and it activates
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. DHX9 is a sensor for rotavirus-derived dsRNA for activating
  the NLRP9b inflammasome. RIG-I (DDX58) itself can also act as an inflammasome sensor.
  Virus-derived RNA or 5′-triphosphate-containing RNA can trigger assembly of an inflammasome
  dependent on RIG-I, ASC, and CARD9.
