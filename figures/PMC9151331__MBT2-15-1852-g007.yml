caption: 'Blockage of the vpk‐gene cluster biosynthetic pathway results in redistribution
  of malonyl‐CoA flux.A. Analysis of relative expression levels of putative gene clusters
  in Nonomuraea gerenzanensis L70 based on RNA sequencing data. The housekeeping gene
  hrdB was chosen as the reference gene.B. Genetic organization of the vpk‐gene cluster
  in N. gerenzanensis L70.C. Phenotypic appearance of culture broths of wild‐type
  and mutant strains after cultivation for 168 h in YS medium.D. Comparison of metabolite
  profiles analysis based on isoabsorbance plot between IPB‐2 and IPB‐3.E. Relative
  levels of the identified metabolites in the different metabolic pathways in IPB‐2
  and IPB‐3 from cultures at 36 h in YS medium. Significant statistical differences
  are shown (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05; NS, not significant). SD bars
  are also shown.F. Production analysis of each component corresponding to the number
  of A40926 complex (Fig. ) by HPLC in IPB‐3 compared with that in IPB‐2.G. Relative
  levels of intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio and ATP concentration in IPB‐2 and IPB‐3
  from cultures at 36 h in YS medium. Abbreviations are: AAM, amino acid metabolism;
  AccA, acetyl‐CoA carboxyl transferase subunit; AccB, acetyl‐CoA carboxylase biotin
  carboxyl carrier protein; AccC, acetyl‐CoA carboxylase biotin carboxylase subunit;
  CYC, cyclase; EMP, Embden‐Meyerhof‐Parnas pathway; KSα, ketosynthase alpha subunit;
  KSβ, ketosynthase beta subunit; LPM, lipid metabolism; PhoP, response regulator;
  PhoR, sensor kinase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
