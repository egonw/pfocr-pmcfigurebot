caption: SCAP recruits STING and TBK1 to the Golgi and activates NF-κB signaling.
  RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (300 ng ml−1) for 16 hours and 50
  μmol/L 25-HC for 3 hours. (A) Schematic diagram of mechanisms by which macrophage
  SCAP activates STING–NF-κB. Immunofluorescence staining of STING and SCAP in liver
  tissues (B) or RAW264.7 cells (C). (D) Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitation with
  anti-SCAP, anti-TBK1, and anti-STING in OE-SCAP RAW264.7 cells. (n = 3). (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining of STING, TBK1, and Golgi 97 in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS (n = 3).
  (F) Immunofluorescence staining of STING, TBK1, and Golgi 97 in RAW264.7 cells treated
  with LPS (n = 3). (G) Protein levels of P65 in cytosolic and nuclear fractions (n =
  3). (H) Protein levels of TBK1, P-TBK1, P-P65, P65, and STING in RAW264.7 cells
  (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± SD. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .0001; ns,
  nonsignificant (2-tailed unpaired t test in bar graphs).
