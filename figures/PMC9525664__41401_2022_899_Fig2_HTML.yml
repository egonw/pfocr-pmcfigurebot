figure_title: IMM-H007 reduces ISO-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation downstream of TGFβ1
  and cardiac fibrosis via an AMPKα2-independent pathway, but the inhibition of TGFβ1
  expression is in an AMPKα2-dependent manner
caption: a TGFβ1 protein levels as determined by ELISAs. b Representative Western
  blots of phosphorylated Smad2/3 in WT and AMPKα2−/− mice. c Western blot analysis
  to quantify collagen I and α-SMA in the hearts of WT mice. d Protein levels of collagen
  I and α-SMA in the hearts of AMPKα2−/− mice. n = 6; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. One-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. α-SMA α-smooth muscle actin, AMPK AMP-activated
  protein kinase, IMM IMM-H007, ISO isoprenaline, TGFβ1 transforming growth factor
  β1, WT wild-type.
