caption: 'piR-2158 suppressed IL11 expression and inactivated JAK-STAT signaling in
  breast cancer. A: Volcano plot showing the different expression genes (DEGs) regulated
  by piR-2158 in MDA-MB-231 cells, in which IL11 was significantly downregulated.
  B: Overexpression of piR-2158 in MDA-MB-231 cells in 3 independent experiments.
  C: QRT-PCR analysis validated downregulation of IL11 by piR-2158 in MDA-MB-231 cells
  in B. D: ELISA analysis showing decreased level of secretory IL-11 in the supernatants
  of piR-2158-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. E: A negative correlation between the
  expression levels of piR-2158 and IL11 in tumor tissues from breast cancer patients
  (n = 32). F: TCGA database showing upregulation of IL11 in human breast cancer tumors
  (n = 1,083). G: Negative correlations between the IL11 expression levels and overall
  survival, disease specific survival and progression free survival in breast cancer
  (n = 1,083). H: KEGG pathway analysis showing the top 5 signaling pathways regulated
  by piR-2158. I and J: Western blot analysis showing downregulation of IL-11 and
  p-STAT3 by piR-2158 in the mammary tumors from mice. Total STAT3 did not show change.
  β-actin served as a loading control. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3
  unless otherwise indicated). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
