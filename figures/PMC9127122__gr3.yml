caption: The effects of macrophage immune microenvironment on the pro-tissue material
  adhesion function of fibroblasts. A) Leading terms analysis reveals components of
  the adhesion clusters, with cell-substrate adhesion at top 2. B) GO terms reveals
  subterms in cell-substrate adhesion components. C) KEGG analysis of cell-substrate
  adhesion components reveals focal adhesion is the most significant pathway in cell-substrate
  adhesion. D) Hub gene analysis of focal adhesion pathway in M2 group. E) RT–qPCR
  results confirm the up-regulation of genes related to focal adhesion. F) Representative
  immunofluorescence images and semi-quantitative statistical analysis of VCL and
  integrin β1 expression of fibroblasts in M2 group. G) Cell adhesion assay reveals
  an increasing percentage of strong adhesion cells in M2 group. H) Correlation analysis
  between up-regulated cytokines of M2 immune microenvironment and up-regulated focal
  adhesion-related genes of fibroblast. Data are presented as means ± SD; *p < 0.05.
