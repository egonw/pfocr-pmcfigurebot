caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and TF-coding genes after 3, 6, 12,
  and 24 h of NaCl stress in the DM plantlets. (A–C) Venn diagrams for all, up-, and
  down-regulated genes, respectively. (D) Distribution diagram for the numbers of
  the DEGs at different salt treatment times, and all NaCl-treated samples were compared
  with CK samples. (E, F) Pie charts for the numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes in different TF families of potato under salt stress, respectively.
article_title: Transcriptome analysis reveals the proline metabolic pathway and its
  potential regulation TF-hub genes in salt-stressed potato.
