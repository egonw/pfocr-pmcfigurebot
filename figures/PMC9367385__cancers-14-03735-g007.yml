caption: 'Knockdown of SH3TC2 inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo. (A) Scheme of
  the in vivo experiments. (B) Images of tumors resected from the mice at the endpoint.
  The tumor weight (C) and tumor volume (D) of the mice. (E) The spaghetti curves
  reveal that SH3TC2 silencing inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo. (F) The mouse
  weight did not change significantly during the experiment. (G) HE and Ki67 staining
  of the tumor tissue. (H) The Ki67-positive area in the negative control group was
  significantly higher than that in the shSH3TC2 group, indicating that silencing
  SH3TC2 inhibited tumorigenesis. Statistical analysis compared the two groups: ns,
  not significant; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
