caption: 'TET2 activation is required for breast CSC sensitivity to ATRA. (a) Immunoblots
  showing protein expression levels of E-cadherin (epithelial marker) and N-cadherin
  (mesenchymal marker) in T47D breast cancer cells that stably expressed sh-TET2 or
  sh-Vec and treated with 10−6 M ATRA or vehicle for 3 days. (b) T47D-sh-TET2 and
  T47D-sh-Vec single-cell suspensions were subjected to three-dimensional (3D) on-top
  matrigel culture (20 000 cells per well in 24-well plate) under 10−6 M ATRA or vehicle
  treatment for 12 days (treatment medium was replenished every 2 days); acini were
  stained for basal polarity marker (α6-integrin, green), epithelial marker (E-cadherin,
  red) and DAPI (nucleus, blue), and then subjected to confocal immnunofluorscence
  microscopic analysis (scale bar: 50 μm, 600 acini were imaged and analyzed from
  three independent experiments, also see ). (c) The percentage of the CD24−CD44+
  population isolated from T47D-sh-TET2 or T47D-sh-Vec cells treated with 10−6 M ATRA
  or vehicle for 3 days (n=3 independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05).
  (d) The number of spheres (sphere size >100 μm) per 1000 initially plated T47D-sh-TET2
  or T47D-sh-Vec cells treated with 10−6 M ATRA or vehicle for 7 days. (n=3 independent
  experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05). (e) The dose response was plotted and EC50
  was calculated using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA), based on the number
  of the spheres generate from T47D-sh-TET2 or T47D-sh-Vec cells treated with ATRA
  or vehicle for 7 days with the dose range between 10−12M and 10−4M (where Y axis
  is the normalized sphere number counts (%) and X axis is the logarithm of (ATRA)
  concentration, n=3 independent experiments, asterisk indicates P<0.05). (f) Dose-response
  curve (normalized sphere number (%) vs log (ATRA) M), (g) nuclear TET2 and RARβ2
  protein expression levels and (h) total 5hmc levels shown by 5 hmc dot blot using
  diluted genomic DNA (1 and 0.5 μg) of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that expressed
  RARβ, RARβ+sh-TET2, RARβ+sh-miR-200c or sh-Vec under ATRA or vehicle treatment (n=3
  independent experiments, double asterisk indicates P<0.01). Comparable amount of
  control vector and vehicle were included as negative control (-) in each group.
