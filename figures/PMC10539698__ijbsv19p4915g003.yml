caption: TAMs lipid metabolism controls both "promoting" and "inhibiting" ends of
  the breast cancer spectrum. (a) Fatty acids. E-FABP in tumor stroma promotes IFN-β,
  enhancing tumoricidal effector cell recruitment and antitumor activity. Inhibited
  HH signaling in M2 macrophages shifts metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation
  to glycolysis, inhibiting the M2 phenotype and promoting the M1 phenotype, inhibiting
  tumor growth. Caspase-1 activates PPARγ, inhibiting fatty acid oxidation and leading
  to lipid droplet accumulation in TAMs and promoting their differentiation to a pro-tumor
  phenotype. High A-FABP expression in TAMs enhances IL-6/STAT3 signaling, promoting
  breast cancer development. (b) Arachidonic acid. COX-2 in TAMs promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition and endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. PGE2 regulates PDL1
  expression in TAMs through the COX2/mPGES1/PGE2 pathway, promoting cancer growth
  and metastasis. (c) Cholesterol. The cholesterol metabolite 27-HC secreted by CYP27A1
  overexpression in TAMs polarizes CCR2+ and CCR5+ monocytes into M2-type macrophages.
