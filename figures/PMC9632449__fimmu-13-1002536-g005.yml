caption: The KEGG metabolic pathway impact analysis. The color and size of each node
  are based on the p values and pathway impact values, respectively. The “human Homo
  sapiens (KEGG)” library was selected to perform pathway enrichment analysis and
  topology analysis. The X-axis presents pathway impact values (based on Out-degree
  Centrality) and the Y-axis presents the respective p values (based on hypergeometric
  test). Each circle represents a pathway. The size of circle indicated the pathway
  impact score, whereas the color represents the p values. Larger circles represent
  higher impact factors, redder colors represent lower p values. Pathways with p values
  less than 0.05 were marked by name.
