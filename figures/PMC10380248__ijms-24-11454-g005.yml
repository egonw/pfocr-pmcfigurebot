caption: Differentially expressed genes in rice stem identified by RNA-Seq comparing
  wild-type ZH11 and ospg3 mutant. (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes.
  (B) Top 25 Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment categories. (C) Heat map showing the expression
  profiles of typical cell wall biosynthesis and regulatory genes and Auxin/IAA-related
  genes in ospg3 knockout mutant. Yellow represents up-regulation, and blue represents
  down-regulation (** p < 0.01, t-test). (D) KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs). (E) The proposed model for OsPG3 mediating plant height
  in rice.
