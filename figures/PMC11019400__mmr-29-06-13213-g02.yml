caption: Multiple positive feedback processes involving HBXIP. After HBXIP upregulates
  TNFR1, this activates the NF-κB pathway, which activates STAT3 in the nucleus and
  activates the HBXIP promoter. After HBXIP upregulates LXRs, activated SREBP-1c stimulates
  the HBXIP promoter. HBXIP inhibits the inhibitory effect of Lin28b on Mettl3, which
  methylates the HBXIP promoter to promote HBXIP expression. HBXIP, hepatitis B X-interacting
  protein; Lin28b, Lin-28 homolog B; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-kB; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; LXRs,
  liver X receptor; Mettl3, methyltransferase-like 3; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory
  element-binding transcription factor 1.
