caption: 'Scoparia dulcis L. extract (SDE) treatment inhibited high-glucose-induced
  inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling
  pathway. After pretreatment with SDE (25, 50, 100 or 200 μg/ml) for 24 h, the ARPE-19
  cells were incubated in a high-glucose (50 mM) medium for 48 h. (A) Protein expression
  of apoptosis-related protein expression levels pNrf2, pAKT, AKT, and HO-1 in cells
  induced by HG was tested by Western blot analysis. (B) pNrf2 were detected using
  immunofluorescence (IF) imaging. Scale bars, 50 μm. DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole;
  LG, low glucose; HG, high glucose; SDE, Scoparia dulcis L. extract. **p < 0.01 compared
  with the control cells incubated in the low-glucose medium; ##p < 0.01 compared
  with the ARPE-19 cells incubated in HG.'
