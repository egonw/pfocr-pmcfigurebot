caption: (A) Metabolite KEGG enrichment diagram of liver tissue samples in control
  and model. (B) Metabolite KEGG enrichment diagram of liver tissue samples in GOS
  and model. Venn diagram of metabolites in different groups where the Rich Factor
  was the ratio of the number of metabolites in the corresponding pathway to the total
  number of metabolites annotated by the detection of that pathway. The larger the
  value was, the greater the enrichment degree was. (C) Venn diagram of metabolites
  in different groups.
