caption: A proposed model for the SE2-mediated rewiring of the Bt Cry1Ac toxin response
  pathway to deliver a resistance phenotype in P. xylostella. In the midgut cells,
  the crosstalk between insect hormones JH and 20E can dephosphorylate the FOXO TF
  to promote the relocation of FOXO from cytoplasm to nucleus, in which FOXO enhances
  the expression of MAP4K4 gene via a conserved FOXO response element (FRE2) found
  in all Cry1Ac susceptible, tolerant, and resistant P. xylostella larvae. Moreover,
  the increased titers of insect hormones enhance FOXO dephosphorylation and MAP4K4
  expression in the Cry1Ac tolerant and resistant P. xylostella larvae. More importantly,
  a SE2 retrotransposon within the resistant MAP4K4 promoter harbors a potent FRE
  (FRE1) which can recruit FOXO protein more efficiently to boost the constitutive
  overexpression of MAP4K4 gene resulting in the downregulation of midgut Cry1Ac receptors,
  thus facilitating the evolutionary adaptation of P. xylostella to Bt Cry1Ac toxin
  as a resistant phenotype.
