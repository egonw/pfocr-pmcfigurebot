caption: Illustration of one exemplarily pathway of forest development, highlighting
  the five key processes influencing forest reorganization. Disruption of any one
  of these five processes or shifts in respective process rates in response to global
  change can lead the system away from resilience, toward restructuring, reassembly,
  replacement, or regime shift (). For more details on processes and examples for
  their influence on reorganization pathways, see .
