caption: A corticothalamic pathway controls response caution. a, AAV encoding the
  inhibitory halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0 n = 6) or eYFP (n = 6) was targeted to PL and
  a fiber optic cannula implanted above PVT. AAV expression (each mouse is shown at
  15% opacity) in PFC and fiber optic tip location in PVT. Distances in millimeters
  from bregma. Illustration from www.biorender.com. b, Electrical stimulation of the
  PLâ†’PVT pathway evoked postsynaptic currents in PVT neurons that were significantly
  reduced by photoinhibition of PL terminals in the PVT. c, Mice were tested under
  conflict in the absence (Off) or presence of photoinhibition (On), with photoinhibition
  delivered only at the goal zone. d, Mean and SEM number of visits to goal zone on
  the track and duration of stay per visit. e, Mean and SEM decision frequency and
  outcome at goal zone on tests with (On) and without (Off) photoinhibition. f, Mean
  and SEM RTs at goal and mid zones. g, Mean and SEM RTs at goal and mid zones for
  eNpHR3.0 mice on test without (Off) and with (On) photoinhibition. *p < 0.05.
