caption: Regulatory mechanism of VSMC in unstable plaques. Serum response factor (SRF)
  blocks the inflammatory pathway by inhibiting ERK/JNK/C-Jun pathway and the expression
  of IL-1β, IL-6 and CCL2. ROS activates the phosphorylation of AMPK and induces phenotypic
  transformation of VSMCs through the klf4-dependent IκBα/NF-κB p65 pathway. Sirtuin6
  (SIRT6) promotes the increase of IL-1β and IL-18 and induces VSMCs senescence by
  activating the phosphorylated p38/JNK/ERK1-Beat 2 pathway.
