caption: 'DCAF13 knockdown inhibits LUAD cell growth, migration and apoptosis inhibition
  in vitro. (A) DCAF13 mRNA expression was detected in LUAD cell lines. The 16HBE
  cells are normal lung bronchial epithelial cells. A549, SPC-A1, NCI-H1299 cells
  are LUAD cell lines. H460 cells are human large-cell lung cancer cells. (B) Effective
  interference of DCAF13 expression by three small interfering RNAs, siDCAF13#1, #2,
  #3, in A549 and SPC-A1 cells. (C) Cell clone formation experiments were performed
  in A549 and SPC-A1 cells with DCAF13 knockdown. (D) CCK-8 experiments were performed
  in A549 and SPC-A1 cells. (E) Flow cytometry was used to analyze the apoptosis rates
  in A549 and SPC-A1 cells with DCAF13 knockdown, and the percentage of late apoptosis
  was compared. (F) Cell migration experiments were performed in A549 and SPC-A1 cells
  with DCAF13 knockdown. Student’s t-test was used in Fig. 2A, C-F. Data presented
  as mean ± SD, n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. Scale bar = 100 μm'
