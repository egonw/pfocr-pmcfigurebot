caption: Apoptosis‐inducing proteins catalyze the MOMP process to release the cytochrome‐c.
  The cytochrome‐c forms an apoptosome complex with adaptor Apaf‐1 and caspase‐9 in
  the cytosol, and ultimately activates the caspase‐9 to initiate caspase‐cascade
  cellular apoptosis. The antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl‐2, Mcl‐1, and Bcl‐xL) inhibit
  the cytochrome‐c release, whereas Bax, Bak, Bid and other apoptosis‐inducing proteins,
  promote the release of cytochrome‐c from mitochondria. The inhibitors of Bcl‐2/Mcl‐1/Bcl‐xL
  prevent PPIs of Bcl‐2/Mcl‐1/Bcl‐xL with apoptosis‐inducing proteins (BH3 helix of
  Bid, Bim, Bad, Puma, Bmf, and Noxa), which increase the cellular level of BAX/BAK,
  their availability for oligomerization, which eventually leads to the release of
  cytochrome‐c.[, ] The Insulin‐like growth factor receptor and insulin receptor tyrosine
  kinase initiate the phosphorylation which activates the intracellular accessary
  signaling cascade via the PI3 K‐AKT pathway, resulting in activating the BAD into
  its phosphorylated form, which then modifies the mitochondrial functions in senescent
  cells.
