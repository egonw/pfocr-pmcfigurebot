caption: The regulation of the Hippo pathway. Many upstream regulators of the Hippo
  pathway have been identified, including cell polarity, cell–cell adhesion, mechanical
  stimuli, metabolism, and soluble factors. The activation of signalling pathways
  leads to YAP/TAZ activity regulation through the Hippo core kinases or alternative
  pathways. Examples of multiple inputs are shown in blue; pathways that inhibit YAP
  are shown in red, and pathways that activate YAP are shown in green.
