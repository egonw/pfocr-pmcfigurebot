caption: 'Target Engagement. Intra-CSF injection of U87MGde2,7 tumor cell line followed
  by next day intra-cisterna magna (ICM) delivery of fluorescently labeled ABT-806
  or ABT-414 (FL-ABT-806 or FL-ABT-414) resulted in in vivo binding. Representative
  images. (a) FL-ABT-806 bound to tumor cells after 30 min of intra-CSF delivery.
  Antibody penetration was limited to the tumor periphery, as evidenced by the red
  color only on the outer layer of the tumor cluster. The antibody penetrated deeper
  into the tumor cluster 1 h post-injection, as seen by the red puncta inside. (b)
  To confirm that FL-ABT-806 bound to human tumor cells as opposed to the rat tissue,
  human-Lamin A + C antibody was used for immunostaining. This antibody colocalized
  with DAPI only in the tumor cell cluster, thereby confirming the human nature of
  the cells. Blue = DAPI, Red = FL-ABT-806, Green = Human-Lamin A+C. (c) Intra-CSF
  delivery of FL-ABT-414 resulted in deeper penetration into the tumor cluster 2 h
  vs. 1 h post-injection, as evidenced by more green puncta inside the tumor. (d)
  ICM administration of a “cocktail” with 1:1 ratio of FL-conjugates of ABT-806: ABT-414
  increased penetration of FL-ABT-414 into the tumor cluster core after 2 h of injection,
  as seen by a higher intensity of green color inside the tumor. Blue = DAPI, Red
  = FL-ABT-806, Green = FL-ABT-414. n = 3 animals per treatment group.'
