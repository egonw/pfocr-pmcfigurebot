figure_title: FGF1 promotes HR pathway activation in response to cisplatin
caption: a Graphical abstract of HR-mediated DNA damage repair. ICL interstrand crosslink,
  DSB double-strand break, RPA replication protein A, ATM ataxia telangiectasia mutated,
  HR homologous recombination. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used
  to compare the formation and dissolution of b RPA foci and c γH2AX foci following
  3 µM cisplatin challenge, following thymidine synchronisation (2 mM, 24 h). Typical
  representative maximum intensity projections are displayed. DAPI was used as a nuclear
  stain. n > 40 cells per treatment. Foci formation was compared by one-way ANOVA.
  ***p < 0.001. Scale bar = 20 µm.
