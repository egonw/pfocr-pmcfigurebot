caption: A proposed model for the molecular mechanism by which GmEIL1 and GmERF113
  regulate soybean resistance to Phytophthora sojae. GmEIL1 is stimulated by P. sojae
  infection, and GmEIL1 enhances GmERF113 expression by binding to the EIN3‐binding
  sequence (EBS) element in the GmERF113 promoter, thus activating the soybean defence
  response to P. sojae. In addition, GmEIL1 promotes the accumulation of ethylene
  by activating the expression of genes related to ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene
  transduction pathway genes to enhance resistance to P. sojae. ET, ethylene; the
  yellow triangle represents ethylene produced.
