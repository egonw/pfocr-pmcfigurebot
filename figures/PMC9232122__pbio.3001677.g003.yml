figure_title: The ODR-3 Gα protein is required for hexanol-mediated activation of
  AWC in sIAA
caption: '(A) Cartoon of the olfactory signal transduction pathway in AWC. Adapted
  from []. (B) Average residence histograms and heatmaps as described for . n = 20–30
  animals per assay; 3 biological replicates. An odr-3 cDNA was expressed in AWC under
  the odr-1 promoter. The concentration of hexanol was 10−4. (C) Chemotaxis indices
  calculated from behavioral assays shown in B. Each dot is the chemotaxis index from
  a single assay in behavior chips. (D) (Left) Average changes in GCaMP3 fluorescence
  in AWC in response to a pulse of 10−4 hexanol in wild-type and odr-3(n2150) mutants.
  The presence of saturating chemicals in the imaging chip at 10−4 dilution is indicated
  by a dashed line. Shaded regions are SEM. (Right) Corresponding heatmaps of changes
  in fluorescence intensity; n ≥ 15 each. A subset of wild-type hexanol response data
  in control conditions were interleaved with data in Figs  and  and are repeated;
  wild-type hexanol response data in sIAA were interleaved with experimental data
  in  and are repeated. Raw traces of hexanol-evoked responses in AWC in control and
  sIAA conditions are shown in . (E) Quantification of fluorescence intensity changes
  upon hexanol odorant onset under nonsaturated or saturated conditions from data
  shown in D. Each dot is the response from a single neuron. Long horizontal bars
  indicate the mean; errors are SEM. *, ***: P < 0.05 and 0.001, respectively (C:
  2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction; E: Kruskal–Wallis with post hoc pairwise
  Wilcoxon test and Benjamini–Hochberg method for P-value correction); ns, not significant.
