caption: Identification of differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs)
  and construction of co-expression modules. 680DEIRGs were identified. (A) Heatmap
  of the 680 DEIRGs. The DEIRGs were enriched in GO terms (B) related with humoral
  immune response, complement activation, adaptive immune response, B cell mediated
  immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity and immunoglobulin mediate immune response
  and KEGG pathways (C) related with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, complement
  and coagulation cascades, viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor,
  IL-17 signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, MAPK signal pathway. Six co-expression
  modules were constructed through WGCNA. The yellow module has the strongest correlation
  with colon cancer. (D) Dendrogram of the six modules. (E) Heatmap of the correlation
  between module eigengenes and sample types.
