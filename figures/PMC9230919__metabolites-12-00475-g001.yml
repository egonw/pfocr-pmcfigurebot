caption: Diagram of the folate metabolic cycle and links to other pathways 5-methyl-THF
  is the major species of folate derived from food and forms the recycling point for
  folate metabolism. It forms the rate-limiting step, through the action of methionine
  synthase (MTR), in the methylation of vitamin B12 and thus the rate-limiting step
  for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Thus, it is critical to folate
  metabolism generally and to the production of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), the universal
  methyl donor for methylation reactions. MTHFD1 is a multi-role enzyme involved in
  three reactions in the folate pathway, forming a long route back to 5-methyl-THF.
  Tetrahydrofolate (THF) can be recycled back through 5, 10-methenyl THF, forming
  a short route and requiring B6 and serine to glycine reactions. Both long and short
  routes require methyleneTHF reductase (MTHFR) for the final step to 5-methyl-THF.
  MTHFD1 is further involved in recycling 10-formyl-THF to THF, fuelling purine synthesis.
  5, 10-methenyl THF can also be reduced to dihydrofolate, fuelling pyrimidine synthesis.
  Other pathways include 5-methyl-THF feeding directly into biogenic amine and nitric
  oxide synthesis through the BH4 cycle, methionine feeding directly into the methylation
  pathway, and acetylcholine synthesis. Folic acid is an artificial substance that
  enters the folate cycle without any 1 carbon moiety to supply to the metabolic process
  and so acts to dilute the 1 carbon pool, as well as having other negative effects
  at higher doses (see text).
