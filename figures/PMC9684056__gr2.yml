caption: Impaired cell proliferation and attenuated Notch signaling occur in the islets
  of T-cadherin KO mice under HFD conditions(A) Principal component analysis of gene
  expression profiles of islets isolated from 8-week-old (8w) and 14-week-old CT and
  KO mice fed an NC or HFD for 6 weeks (n = 3).(B) Volcano plot of DE-Gs of the isolated
  islets under HFD conditions. Data show expression in KO mice compared to CT mice.(C)
  Enrichment analysis of DE-Gs from the isolated islets under HFD conditions using
  the terms of Gene Ontology biological process. Data show regulations in KO mice
  compared to CT mice.(D) Analysis of canonical pathways under HFD conditions using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Data show the regulation of canonical pathways in KO
  mice compared to CT mice.(E) Heatmap of mRNA expression associated with cell proliferation,
  Notch signaling, and the IL-6 family in RNA-seq analysis. The color scale shows
  Z scored FPKM, representing the mRNA expression of each gene in blue (low)-white-red
  (high).(F and G) Quantitative PCR analyses of the isolated murine islets under HFD
  conditions and with the genes associated with cell proliferation, Notch signaling,
  and the IL-6 family (F), and maturation of pancreatic β-cells (G) (∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  unpaired t test. n = 8). Data are shown as the mean ± SEM (F and G). See also .
