caption: SP4 facilitates ESCC progression via modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway by promoting PHF14 transcription. A, Viability of ESCC cells after cotransfection
  with SP4 siRNA-1 and PHF14 overexpression plasmid. B, Cell number of ESCC cells
  after cotransfection with SP4 siRNA-1 and PHF14 overexpression plasmid. C, The cell
  cycle of ESCC cells after cotransfection with SP4 siRNA-1 and PHF14 overexpression
  plasmid was analyzed by flow cytometry. D, Apoptosis of ESCC cells after cotransfection
  with SP4 siRNA-1 and PHF14-overexpression plasmid was analyzed by flow cytometry.
  E, PHF14 mRNA level was measured in ESCC cells after cotransfection with SP4 siRNA-1
  and PHF14 overexpression vector. F, PHF14, Wnt3a, β-Catenin, CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin
  D1, and active caspase 3 expressions were measured after cotransfection with SP4
  siRNA-1 and PHF14 overexpression vector. GAPDH was used as an internal reference.
  Each experiment was performed in triplicate. According to the data characteristics,
  quantitative data of A–E were analyzed by Student t test. *, P < 0.05.
