caption: The most prevalent pathways affected in OSCC. This figure depicts the most
  prevalent pathways affected by molecular/genomic changes in OSCC. This is assessed
  by the number of genes in each pathway whose expression is altered. This alteration
  may be up- or downregulation. By grouping the affected genes by the pathways, they
  are involved in the most common pathways affected are the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  (PIK3CA, PTEN), the cell cycle regulation pathways (TP53, CDKN2A, RB1, CREBBP),
  ECM receptor interactions [].
