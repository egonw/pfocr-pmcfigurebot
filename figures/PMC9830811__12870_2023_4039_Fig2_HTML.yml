caption: Effects of P and Zn supply on root system architecture (RSA) of primary roots
  of maize. Inbred line B73 was grown in a hydroponic solution containing different
  combinations of P and Zn supply for 7 days. A The representative images of primary
  roots of maize taken with a flatbed scanner. Scale bars = 1 cm. B Effects of P and
  Zn supply on total root length, density of 1° lateral roots (LRs), and distance
  of emerged LRs from the root tip. Values are means ± SD (n = 12). Means with the
  same letter are not significantly different at P < 0.05 according to the LSD test
