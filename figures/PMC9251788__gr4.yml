caption: Insights from omics experiments. EndoC-βH1 cells were transfected with control
  nontarget siRNA (siControl) or siRNA targeting PCSK9 (siPCSK9). Three days later,
  cells were profiled by RNA-Seq and proteomics. RNA-Seq data were analyzed with (A)
  ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software, for the top enriched canonical pathways,
  and (B) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software with the Hallmark_Oxidative_Phosphorylation
  gene set. C, GSIS markers deregulated upon PCSK9 knockdown with FDR <0.05 in RNA-Seq
  experiment. D, basal (0.5 mM), glucose-stimulated (20 mM), and KCl-stimulated (50 mM)
  insulin secretions were measured in EndoC-βH1 cells, 3 days following PCSK9 knockdown
  (n = 6). E, Gene Ontology analysis of cellular components terms enriched among genes
  and proteins upregulated following PCSK9 knockdown. F–H, Boxplot showing protein
  expression of top candidate PCSK9 degradation targets, measured on cell protein
  extracts by DIA and TMT proteomic. I, RT–qPCR validation of selected top differentially
  expressed genes (n = 10). For GSIS and RT–qPCR analyses, data are presented as means ±
  SD. For proteomics experiments, median expression and interquartile ranges are shown. +
  FDR < 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. DIA, data-independent acquisition;
  FDR, false discovery rate; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; PCSK9, proprotein
  convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; qPCR, quantitative PCR; TMT, tandem mass tag.
