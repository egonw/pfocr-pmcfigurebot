caption: 'After 12 weeks of JWYHD treatment, the primary BMSCs of each group (SHAM,
  OVX, E2, L, M, and H were taken to detect the phenotype of the cells. (a) ARS (Scale
  bar: 200 μm), ALPS (Scale bar: 200 μm), ORS (Scale bar: 200 μm), and CFU (Magnification:
  1×). (b) The increment of primary BMSCs at 24 hours and 48 hours. (c) The matrix
  mineralization area of ARS. (d) The area of ALPS. (e) The lipidation area of ORS.
  (f) The area of CFU. The data were represented by mean ± SD (n = 3), P < 0.05 were
  considered as significant difference: ∗ VS. CTRL group, #VS. M group.'
