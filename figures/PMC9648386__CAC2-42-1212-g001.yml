caption: 'Derivation and validation of a gemcitabine‐response component. (A). PDX
  and PDC agglomerative hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic data unravel 7 patients
  with high transcriptomic similarity (HTS, PDAC028T, PDAC031T, PDAC054T, PDAC083T,
  PDAC087T, PDAC089T and PDAC091T). (B) Boxplot of Spearman correlation coefficients
  shows a high correlation between PDXs and the corresponding PDCs in the HTS patients
  (0.48 ± 0.11) compared with the low transcriptomic similarity group (LTS, n = 31),
  which displayed a coefficient of 0.13 ± 0.18 (P < 0.001). (C) Identification of
  ICA2 component as gemcitabine‐response component by independent component analysis
  on the 7 HTS PDCs and Spearman correlation with the AUC as selection parameter (r
  = −0.93, P = 0.003). (D) ICA2 sample contribution correlates positively with the
  ICA4 component extracted from the 7 HTS PDXs (r = 0.93, P = 0.003). (E) Scatterplots
  representing the correlation between the projected ICA2 and the response to gemcitabine
  measured by AUC, with Spearman test in an independent cohort of 31 PDCs (r = −0.43,
  P = 0.010), 13 PDXs (r = −0.63, P = 0.010), 14 PDOs (r = −0.70, P = 0.003) and 11
  CCLs (r = −0.61, P = 0.027). (F) Nicole et al., cohort (n = 305) showed a significant
  patient stratification following the GemCore signature for disease‐free survival
  (DFS). GemCore+ patients treated with gemcitabine showed a median DSF (38.6 months,
  95% CI = 19.93‐Not reached) higher than other groups (G) Nicolle et al. cohort GemCore+
  patients treated with gemcitabine showed a DFS hazard ratio of 0.5 (95% CI = 0.32‐0.79,
  P = 0.003). (H) GemCore pathway enrichment analysis shows an association between
  drug detoxification mechanisms, such as glucuronidation (FDR < 0.001), phase II
  conjugation of compounds (FDR < 0.001), and biological oxidations (FDR < 0.001)
  with gemcitabine resistance. (I) GemCore String enrichment analysis shows significant
  protein‐protein interactions (PPI) between the UGT proteins (J) The IC50 after the
  treatment with diclofenac, observing a significant reduction in the IC50 in the
  resistant PDCs at 25 μmol/L. (K) UGT1A expression measured by immunofluorescence
  in a set of PDX samples distributed along the gemcitabine response profile, displaying
  a range from 85% to no detectable number of cells. Scale bar: 200 μm. (L) Spearman
  correlation of UGT activity and percentage of resistance in a set of fifteen PDXs
  (r = 0.79, P < 0.001). (M) Tumor growth curves for six PDXs (3 resistant and 3 sensitive)
  treated with vehicle, gemcitabine, diclofenac, or diclofenac plus gemcitabine. Resistant
  PDXs (PDAC076T, PDAC082T, and PDAC085T) treated with diclofenac and gemcitabine
  show a significant reduction in tumor volume compared with gemcitabine alone. (N)
  Box plot of UGT activity levels in resistant PDXs at the end time‐point. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Results are shown as means ± SD. Differences between two
  groups are calculated by the Mann‐Whitney test. Multi‐group comparison is calculated
  by the Kruskal‐Wallis test following Dunn''s test'
