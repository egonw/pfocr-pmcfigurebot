caption: MyD88 is highly expressed in PDAC and indicates a worse clinical outcome.
  The MyD88 inhibitor, ST2825, suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. (A) Gene
  expression of MyD88 in PDAC (n=179) and paracancerous tissues (n=171) from TCGA
  database. (B and C) Overall survival time and disease-free survival time of the
  patients in the high MyD88 group (n=45) compared with those in the low MyD88 group
  (n=45) from TCGA database. (B and C) Overall survive time and disease-free survive
  time of the high MyD88 group (N=45) compared with the low MyD88 group (n=45) from
  the TCGA database. (D and E) Immunohistochemical staining and H-score of MyD88 in
  PDAC and paracancerous tissues from the tissue chip (n=64). (F) Overall survival
  time of the high MyD88 group (n=32) compared with the low MyD88 group (n=32) from
  the tissue chip. (G and H) Western blot analysis of the expression of MyD88 in HPNE,
  CFPAC-1, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines. (I and J) MTT assay was used to determine
  the IC50 values and colony formation assay was used to determine the growth of PANC-1
  and BxPC-3 cell lines treated with ST2825. (K) Image of each nude mouse and its
  hypodermic tumor, body/tumor weight changes in the mice treated with the negative
  control and ST2825. (L and M) Immunohistochemical staining (×1 and ×20 magnification)
  and H-score of MyD88 in tissues of the negative control and ST2825 groups. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate (apart from the animal experiments) and the data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. The t-test was used for statistical analysis, *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; N.S., not significant. PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;
  MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; IC50, half maximal inhibitory concentration;
  PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; NC, negative control; ST, ST2825.
