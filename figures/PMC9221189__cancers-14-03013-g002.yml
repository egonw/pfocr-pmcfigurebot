caption: UDP-GlcNAc synthesis via the HBP and O-GlcNAc cycling. In the HBP, UDP-GlcNAc,
  an active monosaccharide donor for O-GlcNAcylation, is synthesized by consolidating
  glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, and UTP, which are metabolites of carbohydrates,
  proteins, lipid acids, and nucleotides, respectively. The GlcNAc moiety of UDP-GlcNAc
  is transferred by OGT to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr residues on target proteins.
  O-GlcNAc from target proteins is then hydrolyzed by OGA.
