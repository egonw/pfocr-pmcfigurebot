caption: 'Modular transcriptional regulation of the mevalonate pathway to tune limonene
  production in E. coli. (a) Limonene production pathway, where acetyl-CoA serves
  as the starting substrate in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which then over multiple
  steps is consumed alongside NADPH and ATP to produce IPP or DMAPP and then limonene.
  Abbreviations: AtoB, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase;
  PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD, mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; IPP,
  isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; Idi, isopentenyl
  diphosphate isomerase; trGPPS, truncated geranyl diphosphate synthase; GPP, geranyl
  diphosphate; LS, limonene synthase. (b) Marionette E. coli strain MG1655, where
  heterologous repressors are integrated into the genome at the glvC locus. These
  endogenous repressors are constitutively expressed and will bind to their cognate
  promoters on a plasmid to regulate downstream gene expression. Four inducible promoters
  (PBAD, PBetl, PCymR, and Ptcr, induced by l-arabinose (Ara), choline chloride (Cho),
  cuminic acid (Cuma), and isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), respectively)
  are inserted to modularize the limonene synthesis pathway. (c) A marionette transcriptional
  circuit enables both modular and multivariate application of chemical inducers to
  tune the expression of enzymes. Limonene production after 48 h of fermentation is
  measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).'
