caption: Functional enrichment analysis of the radiosensitivity signature in UCEC.
  (A) Evaluation of pathway activity differences between RS and RR groups using GSVA.
  Pathway activities were scored per sample. (B) Correlation analysis between the
  expression levels of the four genes comprising the radiosensitivity signature and
  hallmark DNA damage repair pathways. (C) GSEA was conducted to confirm the biological
  functions associated with the RS and RR groups in the TCGA cohort. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001.
