caption: 'Growth of wild-type (WT) and atg5 mutant Physcomitrella colonies. WT and
  atg5 mutant cells of Physcomitrella were transferred onto BCDATG agar medium and
  cultured under light conditions for 7 d. (A) The same colonies were photographed
  immediately (0 d), 3, 5, and 7 d after transfer. Scale bar: 2 mm. (B) Fresh weight
  (FW) of 50 WT and atg5 colonies was measured immediately (0 d) and 7 d after transfer.
  (C) Dry weight (DW) was also measured, and the DW to FW ratio (DW/FW) was calculated.
  (B,C) Data are shown as means Â± standard deviation (SD) (n = 3, * p < 0.05).'
