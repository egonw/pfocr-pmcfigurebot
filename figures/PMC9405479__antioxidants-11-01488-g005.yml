caption: IFN-β is involved in an intricate feedforward loop by increasing the NOX2-dependent
  oxidative burst. (A–C) RAW 264.7 cells following 24 h treatment of recombinant IFN-β
  (100 ng/mL) measuring; (A,C) oxidative burst measured by L-012-enhanced chemiluminescence,
  (B) mRNA expression measured using qPCR; (D,E) RAW 264.7 cells pre-treated with
  apocynin (300 µM) followed by 24 h treatment of LPS (100 ng/mL). Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM of n = 4–8 experiments. Data are expressed as (A,D) fold change vs.
  control relative to the housekeeping gene RPS18 and (B) relative light units (RLU),
  measured as an average of triplicates over a 60-cycle period, subtracted by blank
  readings or the fold change against the vehicle control of a peak response over
  an average of triplicates over the 60-cycle period, subtracted by blank readings,
  (C) Fold change vs. control relative to the housekeeping protein β-actin, and E)
  in pg/mL. Statistical analysis was conducted using (A–C) an unpaired Student’s t-test,
  or (D,E) a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons.
  * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001 and **** indicates
  p < 0.0001.
