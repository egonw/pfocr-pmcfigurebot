caption: The effect of atranorin, caperatic acid, physodic acid, squamatic acid, salazinic
  acid, and lecanoric acid on the cell cycle distribution of A-172 (panel (A)), T98G
  (panel (B)), and U-138 MG cells (panel (C)). The percentage of cells in the G1/G0,
  S, and G2/M phases was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with propidium
  iodide and RNase A. Topotecan was used as a positive control in this assay. Statistically
  significant differences (p < 0.05) in cell cycle distribution between the cells
  exposed to the analyzed lichen secondary metabolites as compared to the control
  cells treated with DMSO (Ctrl) are indicated with an asterisk (*). Representative
  histograms are shown on the right-hand side. The mean values ± SEM from three independent
  experiments are presented.
