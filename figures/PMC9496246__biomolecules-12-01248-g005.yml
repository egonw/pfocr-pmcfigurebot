caption: 'Pathway of Aβ production: the link with metals. The main constituent of
  amyloid aggregates is Aβ, a peptide of 39-43 amino acids, resulting from the cleavage
  of APP a transmembrane protein. More specifically, it has been reported that APP
  can be processed into two separate pathways. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is
  first cleaved by β-secretase at a site outside the cell surface. This generates
  a C-terminal fragment that is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase at a site within
  the transmembrane domain. The product of this cleavage is Aβ. In the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway, APP is initially cut by α-secretase and then by γ-secretase, releasing
  a truncated P3 fragment. It was found that APP has specific copper and zinc-binding
  domains that catalyze redox activity, determining Aβ precipitation in plaques even
  at minimal concentrations. Copper and zinc domain in the Aβ peptide bind equimolar
  amounts of the two metals (Me2+). However, under acidosis conditions, Aβ zinc is
  copper completely displaced by copper.'
