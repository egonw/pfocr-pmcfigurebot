caption: 'YOH suppresses expression of PDGF-BB-induced CDK2 and PCNA and upregulates
  expression of p27Kip1 and p53 in MOVAS-1 cells. MOVAS-1 cells were incubated with
  YOH (10 or 20 μM) for 45 min and treated with (A,B) or without (C,D) PDGF-BB stimulation
  (10 ng/mL). Protein expression levels of (A) CDK2, (B) PCNA, (C) p27Kip1, and (D)
  p53 were determined through Western blotting, as described in the Materials and
  Methods section. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the resting group; #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01 compared with the positive group. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M.
