caption: Immune landscape of TIRS subtypes(A and B) Difference of immune cell infiltration
  and immune-target expression between two TIRS groups through CIBERSORT (A) and ESTIMATE
  (B). Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis, with ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗p < 0.05.(C and D) Gene mutation analysis in high- (C) and low-risk (D) groups.(E)
  GSEA showing significant differences in biological processes between high- and low-risk
  groups, which were the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway, and natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Statistical significance
  was set at p < 0.05. NES, normalized enrichment score.(F and G) GO and KEGG analysis
  of the differentially expressed genes.
