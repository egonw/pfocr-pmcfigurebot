caption: Mitochondrial changes in apoptosis possibly possess a more sensitive response
  to hepatic ischaemia. Warm ischaemia (I), Reperfusion (R). (A, C) The degree of
  tissue oxidation- [Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-SOD], apoptosis- (IHC-Caspase-3),
  and morphological change-related indicators in different ischaemic and reperfusion
  periods of mice livers [IHC, transmission electron microscope (TEM)]. The obvious
  injury occurred at I-30 and I-60 min (Supporting Fig. S1, Supplemental Digital Content
  2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A493) after reperfusion. There were no significant morphological,
  immunohistochemical, or immunofluorescent changes observed under a light microscope
  at I-15, I-30, or I-60 min without reperfusion. Via TEM, the mitochondria of the
  I-60 min without reperfusion conformed with Flameng  2–3 points, whereas those of
  the I-60 min with R-2 h conformed with Flameng 3–4 points. We were able to observe
  evident structural changes in the mitochondria at I-15 (Flameng 2 points). (B) High-throughput
  sequencing of the transcriptome at each ischaemia time point (three samples in the
  normal group and eight samples in either I-15, I-30, or I-60 min group). Signal
  pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the signal pathway that changed throughout
  each ischaemia time point was the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. (D) Western blot
  analysis of the apoptosis-related molecules Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax.
