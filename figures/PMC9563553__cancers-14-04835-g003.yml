caption: 'The correlation heatmap showing comparisons between all biomarkers and relevant
  clinical features is displayed in Panel (A). Blue color represents positive correlation
  coefficients, while red color represents negative correlation coefficients. The
  intensity of the color in the whole panel and the dimension of the circles in the
  upper triangle represent the magnitude of the correlation coefficients. Statistical
  significance levels are shown by asterisks as follows: * for p < 0.05, ** for p
  < 0.01, and *** for p < 0.001. The expression proportions of biomarkers in tumors
  that reached pCR compared to tumors that did not reach pCR (No pCR) are displayed
  in terms of percentage of cells stained (_P) in Panel (B) and in terms of immunoreaction
  intensity score (_S) in Panel (C). Suffixes: _N = nuclear; _C = cytoplasmic; _S
  = immunoreaction intensity score; _P = percentage of cells stained; _SxP = multiplication
  of immunoreaction intensity score with percentage of cells stained; SxP_irs = international
  immunoreactive score.'
