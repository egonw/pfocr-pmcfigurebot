caption: 'EN activates the mTOR signaling pathway and inhibits autophagy. (A) HCT116
  cells were treated with different concentrations of EN (0, 8, 16, and 24 μM) or
  with EN (16 μM) for different times (0, 6, 12, and 24 h). Western blotting was used
  to analyze the phosphorylation levels of ERK, mTOR, and S6. (B) As in (A), SW620
  cells were treated with EN and harvested for Western blotting analysis. (C) HCT116
  cells were pretreated with rapamycin (200 nM) for 2 h and then continued to be treated
  with EN (16 μM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysed for Western blotting to
  detect the expression levels of mTOR, S6, and LC3. (D) As in (C), SW620 cells were
  pretreated with rapamycin and then continued to be treated with EN. Cells were harvested
  for Western blotting analysis. (E) HCT116 cells were first transfected with Flag-Beclin-1
  for 24 h and then treated with EN (16 μM) for 24 h. After fixation and permeabilization,
  cells were incubated with VEGFR2 conjugated to PE, and a confocal microscope was
  used to detect cell fluorescence. Scale bar: 25 μm. (F) As in (D), cell fluorescence
  intensity was quantified by flow cytometry and was statistically analyzed. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
