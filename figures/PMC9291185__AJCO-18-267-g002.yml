caption: miRNA‐31 uprelated in tumor tissue, its context regulatory molecular involved
  in multiple pathways about cell cycle. (A) Based on the records in ENCORI database,
  hsa‐mir‐31‐5p is significantly upregulated in colon cancer (COAD) tumor samples
  from the TCGA cohort (fold change = 2.00, corrected p‐value = 1.20e−4). (B) The
  core regulatory interaction network of hsa‐mir‐31‐5p. Only the functional miRNA‐
  target interactions and literature‐derived TF‐miRNA regulations are shown, which
  are depicted as blue and red arrow, respectively. The known oncogene and tumor suppressor
  genes of colon cancer are colored red and green, respectively. Functionally causal
  genes of other cancer types are shown in yellow. C and D are pathway enrichment
  of TFs and target genes. (C) 58 upstream regulatory TFs of hsa‐mir‐31‐5p were obtained.
  The top 10 GO function terms and all significant KEGG pathways are shown in bar
  plot. (D) 220 target genes of hsa‐mir‐31‐5p were obtained. The top 10 GO function
  terms and all significant KEGG pathways are shown in bar plot
