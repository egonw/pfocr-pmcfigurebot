figure_title: Multi-omics approaches to uncover new transcriptional pathways for neuroprotection
  and molecular targets for effective axon regeneration
caption: (A) Tian et al. performed an AAV-mediated in vivo CRISPR loss-of-function
  screen against all known mammalian TFs following ONC. RGC counts reflecting neuroprotection
  and RGC axon regeneration were assessed following the deletion of each TF. By integrating
  their CRISPR screening results with ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq of injured RGCs following
  ONC, the authors uncovered parallel core transcriptional machinery to boost neuroprotection
  with synergistic effects in ONC and glaucomatous conditions. (B & C) Jacobi et al.
  and  profiled RGCs primed for regeneration with scRNA-Seq following ONC and used
  retrograde labeling methods to distinguish regenerating from surviving but non-regenerating
  RGCs. The two studies used different surgical methods, as shown, to deliver a small-molecular
  weight fluorescent dye for retrograde labeling. (B) Jacobi et al. uncovered RGC
  taxonomy changes under three different regenerative interventions; differentiated
  GO patterns among dying, surviving, and regenerating RGCs; and showed that several
  molecules in neuropeptide signaling are critical for optic nerve regeneration. (C)  compared
  regenerating RGCs to surviving but non-regenerating RGCs followed by PTEN KO and
  identified differentially expressed genes between the two RGC groups. They then
  tested the regeneration-associated genes using an AAV-overexpression screen. They
  uncovered a role for the tPA/Anxa2 pathway in promoting axon regeneration and protecting
  RGC loss under glaucomatous conditions.
