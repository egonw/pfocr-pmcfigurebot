caption: Overexpression of ANTXR1 promoted the combination of c-Jun and SOX6. (a)
  ChIP-qPCR assays were performed using K562 cells expressing ANTXR1, while an empty
  vector served as a control. The immunoprecipitated DNA of SOX6, EIF2AK, BGLT3, and
  ZBTB7A 4 binding site to c-Jun, as well as input DNA, were used as templates for
  quantitative fluorescence PCR. The enrichments were quantified by ChIP-qPCR and
  normalized by comparison to input DNA (% input). (b) After overexpression of c-Jun
  in K562 cells, the protein levels of c-Jun and SOX6 were measured by western blotting.
  (c, d) Quantification of the western blot. The experiments n = 3. The error bar
  represents the SD. ∗∗P < 0.01.
