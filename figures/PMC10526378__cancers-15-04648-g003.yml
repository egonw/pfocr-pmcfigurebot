caption: 'Interleukin-6 in the tumor microenvironment and its action on VEGF axis.
  The formation of IL-6 from stimulated IL-6 mRNA, leads to a release of IL-6, in
  high concentration, in the extracellular milieu. After connecting to its receptors,
  IL-6 initiates a chain of reactions that will ultimately lead to the synthesis of
  VEGF and therefore to angiogenesis. The figure also shows the different therapeutic
  molecules used to inhibit this pathway and therefore treat cancer. Data source:
  Adapted figure from the article “Cross-talk between EGFR and IL-6 drives oncogenic
  signaling and offers therapeutic opportunities in cancer” by Ray K, Ujvari B, Ramana
  V and Donald J. []. Re-use License number 5615250558075.'
