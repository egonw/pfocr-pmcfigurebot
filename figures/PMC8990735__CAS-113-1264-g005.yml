caption: 'MEK/ERK‐MYC‐MiT/TFE‐lysosomal gene axis in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs).
  (A) MYC and ATP6V1B1 levels in several types of renal tumors and adjacent normal
  tissues. The expression of each gene in primary renal tumor (red) and normal tissue
  (blue) was analyzed (TCGA data set). Boxes represent the interquartile range and
  line inside the box represents median value. (B) Gene set variation analysis of
  MYC and lysosome‐related gene expression in MSigDB 7.1. (C) Immunohistochemistry
  for pERK, c‐MYC, TFEB, TFE3, MITF, ATP6V1B1, and LAMP1 in RCC and matched‐adjacent
  normal renal tissues (magnification: ×20). Inset: ×160 magnified view. Representative
  images from 24 samples are shown. Scale bars, 100 μm. (D) Kaplan‐Meier plots of
  MYC and ATP6V1B1 in renal cancer (TCGA data set). (E) Schematic model of MEK/ERK
  pathway role in regulating the fate of MVBs and control EV secretion. In normal
  cells, the MEK/ERK pathway is inactivated, presumably preserving the expression
  of lysosomal genes, including vacuolar‐type H+‐ATPase, and maintaining lysosome
  function. MVBs are degraded and therefore the number of MVBs fusing with the plasma
  membrane is low, leading to suppression of EV secretion. In cancer cells, when the
  MEK/ERK pathway is activated, MYC expression is increased and MiT/TFEs transcription
  factors are retained in the cytoplasm, inactivating the transcription of lysosomal
  genes and disrupting lysosome function. A large amount of MVBs can therefore fuse
  with the plasma membrane, promoting EV secretion. Statistical analysis was performed
  using one‐way ANOVA. ***p < 0.001'
