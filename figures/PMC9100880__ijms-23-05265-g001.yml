caption: Spatiotemporal expression of Hedgehog pathway components is finely tuned
  during human lung development. Gene expression of SHH (A), PTCH1 (B), and HHIP (C)
  expressed in RPKMs ± SEM within the developing lung at 10-, 14- and 20-week gestation
  (n = 3 per time point, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (D–F) Dot plots show the percentage
  of cells expressing SHH (D), PTCH1 (E), and HHIP (F) using dot size and the average
  expression level of that gene based on unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts.
  (G–I) Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on 11 wks gestation fetal human lung
  sections showing SHH (red) and HHIP (green) (G); PTCH1 (green) with ACTA2 (IF, red)
  (H) and HHIP (green) with ACTA2 (IF, red) (I). Scale bars are 100 µm for large insets
  and 15 µm for small insets.
