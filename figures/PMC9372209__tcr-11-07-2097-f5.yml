caption: The copy number variation features associated with hypoxia scores. (A) The
  significant copy number variation regions in HCC patients with high hypoxia scores.
  (B) The significant copy number variation regions in HCC patients with low hypoxia
  scores. (C) The unique copy number amplification and deletion regions of patients
  with high hypoxia scores (red) and low hypoxia scores (blue). (D) The KEGG enrichment
  results of high hypoxia-related copy number variations. The copy number amplification
  regions only enriched in 1 pathway (red bar). The top 5 enriched pathways of copy
  number deletion regions were displayed (blue bar). (E) The KEGG enrichment results
  of low hypoxia related copy number variations. The copy number amplification regions
  did not enrich in any pathways. The top 5 enriched pathways of copy number deletion
  regions were displayed (blue bar). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.
