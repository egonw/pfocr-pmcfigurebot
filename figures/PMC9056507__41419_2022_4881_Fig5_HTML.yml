figure_title: GCN5 regulates TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway in hypertrophic hearts
  and cardiomyocytes
caption: 'A Western blots showing the activity of TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway components
  in NRCMs infected with AdNull or AdGCN5 for 24 h, followed by treatment with PBS
  or PE (∗∗P < 0.01 vs AdNull PBS; n.s., ##P < 0.01 vs AdNull PE). B Western blots
  showing the activity of TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway components in NRCMs infected
  with AdshRNA or AdshGCN5 for 24 h, followed by treatment with PBS or PE (∗∗P < 0.01
  vs AdshRNA PBS; n.s., ##P < 0.01 vs AdshRNA PE). C Western blot showing the activity
  of TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway components in the hearts of GCN5-overexpressing
  mice or control mice subjected to sham or TAC surgery at 4 weeks (n = 7–9 mice/group,
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs AAV9-Vector SHAM; n.s., #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs AAV9-Vector TAC 4 W).
  D Western blot showing the activity of TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway components
  in the hearts of GCN5-inhibited mice or control mice subjected to sham or TAC surgery
  at 4 weeks (n = 7-8 mice/group, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs DMSO SHAM; n.s., ##P < 0.01 vs DMSO
  TAC 4 W).'
