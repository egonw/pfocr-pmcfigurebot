caption: 'Expression level of genes converting intermediates of the flavonoid pathway
  during development of F. chiloensis fruit and in response to ABA treatment. Fruit
  at C2 stage was immersed in 1 mM ABA or 100 µM Fluridon (short-term treatment) or
  fruit pedicel was submerged in 1 mM ABA or only buffer (longer-time treatment).
  Changes in the expression level of each gene during fruit development are shown
  on the left-hand side of the figure; in the center the effect of ABA/FLD in the
  short-term treatment; on the right-hand side the effect of ABA in the long-term
  treatment. The expression level of genes of the flavonoid pathway was determined
  through qPCR analysis: FcFLS, flavonol synthase (A–C); FcLAR, Leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase (D–F); FcANR, anthocyanidin reductase (G–I). In expression analysis during
  development progress of F. chiloensis, different letters indicate significant differences
  between fruit stages (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett correction post hoc). In ABA short-term
  treatments, asterisks or circles indicate significant differences compared to time
  0 for each hormone/inhibitor treatment (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001;
  one-way ANOVA with Dunnett correction post hoc). For ABA long-term treatment, asterisks
  indicate significant differences between treatments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01), and
  bars with asterisks indicate significant difference between days of control group;
  two-way ANOVA with Tukey correction post hoc test was used.'
