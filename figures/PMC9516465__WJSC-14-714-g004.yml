caption: 'SNHG16 was a potential promotor of human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem
  cell proliferation ability. A: Cell cycle analysis of human placenta-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells (hP-MSCs) under hypoxic culture via flow cytometry; B: Western blot analysis
  of AKT phosphorylation in hP-MSCs exposed to hypoxia; C: Circos plot of the long
  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)-messenger (m)RNA co-expression network. The outermost
  circle is the autosomal distribution. The second and third circles are the distribution
  of differentially expressed lncRNAs on chromosomes. The red line represents upregulation,
  and the green line represents downregulation. Higher bars indicate a greater number
  of differential genes in the interval. The fourth and fifth circles are the distribution
  of differentially expressed genes on chromosomes, with the same interpretation as
  lncRNA; D: Part of lncRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis visualized using the
  Cytoscape software; E: Part of the association analysis of differentially expressed
  lncRNAs and transcription factors; F: Effects of hypoxia on the expression of SNHG16
  in hP-MSCs by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Data
  are presented as means Â± standard deviation. bP < 0.01.'
