caption: Baicalein targeted inhibition of the SMYD2/RPS7 signaling pathway to inhibit
  lung cancer cells. (a) Baicalein inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer A549
  and NCI-H1299 cell lines in differences dose. (b) Baicalein inhibits the invasion
  ability of lung cancer A549 and NCI-H1299 cell lines. (c) Baicalein inhibits the
  cloning ability of lung cancer A549 and NCI-H1299 cell lines. (d) qRT-PCR detection
  of Baicalein inhibits the expression of SMYD2 in lung cancer A549 and NCI-H1299
  cells. (e) qRT-PCR detection of Baicalein inhibits the expression of RPS7 in lung
  cancer A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. ∗∗P < 0.01.
