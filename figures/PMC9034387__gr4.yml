caption: 'TSPAN31 regulates the migration of GC cells. (A and B) The longitudinal
  migration capacity of GC cells transfected with siTSPAN31 and Lv-TSPAN31 OE was
  determined by the Transwell assay (magnification: 100×). (C and D) The lateral migration
  capacity of GC cells transfected with siTSPAN31 and Lv-TSPAN31 OE was determined
  by the wound healing assay (magnification: 100×) (*P < 0.05; ⁎⁎P < 0.01; ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001).'
