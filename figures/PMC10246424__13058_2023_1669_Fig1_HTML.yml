caption: 'A Projection of different subgroups of breast cancer infiltrating myeloid
  cells in 2-dimensional UMAP space (axes represent dimensions, colors represent different
  cell subgroups). B Dot-plot of representative marker genes of each myeloid subgroup
  (y axis represents cell subgroups, x axis represents different genes, colors represent
  the average expression level of each gene, dot-size represents the expression percentage
  in each cell subtype). C Heatmap of single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)
  score of major myeloid pathways in each subgroup (y axis represents the different
  pathways with breaks for major pathway types, x axis represents different cell subgroups,
  colors represent the enrichment scores (Red: high score; Blue: Low score)). D Interaction
  intensities between each myeloid subgroup as measured by interacting receptor pairs
  (y axis represents the receiver (target) of interactions, x axis represents the
  donor (source) of interactions). E Graph-based arrangement of different myeloid
  subgroups according to their interacting centricity (colors represent different
  cell subtypes, line weight represents the intensity of interactions)'
