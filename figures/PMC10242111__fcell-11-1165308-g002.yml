caption: '(A) Characteristics and analyses of patient’s sample at each time point.
  BM, bone marrow; EM, extra-medullary; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; Ino,
  inotuzumab ozogamicin; MNCs, mononuclear cells; MRD, minimal residual disease; mut,
  mutation; na, not available; Neg, negative; PB, peripheral blood; Pos, positive;VEN,
  venetoclax; wt, wild type; and y, yes. (B) CRLF2 expression analysis in the patients’
  samples and comparison groups. For the CRLF2 gene, swarm plots of log-transformed
  TPM are displayed. Each plot is a combination of one group of samples with one time
  point sample. The time point sample is highlighted with a bigger dot, and its color
  changes, depending on its z-score value (green if |z|>1.96; otherwise, red). The
  horizontal black lines mark the median. Ctrls, healthy donor group (n = 15); Ph+,
  BCR-ABL1-positive group (n = 31); TN, triple-negative group (n = 105). (C) JAK1
  mutation in the patient’s sample. JAK1 protein diagram with the site of the V651M
  somatic variant (NM_002227:exon14:c.G1951A:p.V651M; Human hg19) within the tyrosine
  kinase domain and DNA Sanger sequencing chromatograms of the JAK1 V651 position
  at different time points (1: extramedullary relapse- Dec/2018; 2: third relapse—Jan/2019;
  3: post-inotuzomab ozogamicin hematological remission—Jun/2019; 4: post-venetoclax
  remission—Jul/2021). * site of heterozygous mutation (V651M); #V651 wild-type site.'
