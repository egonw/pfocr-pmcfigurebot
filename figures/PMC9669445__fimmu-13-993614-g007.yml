caption: DHA suppresses expression of genes associated with cholesterol metabolism
  and inflammatory signaling pathways at 1 h post-LPS treatment. (A) Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using the Seurat FindMarkers function,
  with thresholds set to select genes with >1.5-fold change in gene expression and
  genes expressed in at least 25% of groups being compared. DEGs in the “Down with
  DHA” circle of the Venn diagram are downregulated in DHA.LPS.1 relative to Veh.LPS.1
  and DEGs in the “Up with LPS” circle of the Venn diagram are upregulated in Veh.LPS.1
  relative to Veh. The intersection represents LPS-induced genes suppressed by DHA
  at 1h. (B) 7 of the 11 LPS-induced genes suppressed by DHA involve the cholesterol
  synthesis pathway. (C) Other LPS-induced genes suppressed by DHA at 1 h are also
  suppressed by DHA at 4 h.
