caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment scatter
  diagram of DEGs. Only the top 20 most strongly represented pathways are displayed
  in the diagram. The degree of KEGG pathway enrichment is represented by an enrichment
  factor, the FDR value, and the number of genes enriched in a KEGG pathway. The enrichment
  factor indicates the ratio of differentially expressed genes enriched in this pathway
  to the total number of annotated unigenes in this pathway. The red underline represents
  the same enriched pathways among whole plants, leaves, roots, and co-induced DEGs.
  (A) KEGG enrichment analysis of the leaves. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of the
  roots.
