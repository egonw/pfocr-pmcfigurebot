caption: 'Effect of CNP extract on glutamate-induced apoptosis in HT22 cells. The
  cells were pretreated with CNP extract (0.1–50 µg/mL) for 24 h, followed by 5 mM
  glutamate for 18 h. After incubation, the HT22 cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI
  probes, and (a) the numbers of cell deaths were analyzed via flow cytometry. The
  quarter sections represent the cells stages: Q1: necrosis; Q2: late apoptosis; Q3:
  live; Q4: early apoptosis. (b) The histogram represents the percentages of apoptotic
  and necrotic cells. For cells pretreated with CNP extract (c) or resveratrol (d)
  prior to glutamate incubation, the levels of caspase-3 protein expression were determined
  via Western blot, and histograms show relative of pro- or cleaved caspase-3 expression
  levels and normalized by β-actin. Values are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3).
  Note: # p < 0.05 versus cell control, *** p < 0.001 versus 5 mM glutamate-treated
  cells.'
