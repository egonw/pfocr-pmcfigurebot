  in colorectal cancer
caption: 'A Western blot of pSTAT3 and GAPDH protein expression levels in LIM2405
  cells treated with BZA (3 nM - 30 µM) for 1 hour and stimulated with 30 ng/ml IL-6
  and IL-11 for 15 min. B Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC (AV) and TO-PRO-3-iodide
  stained LIM2405 cells treated with 15 μM BZA alone and 15 μM BZA + 50 μM QVD in
  the presence of 30 ng/ml of IL-11 for 8 hours. Error bars are mean ± SEM of n = 3
  replicates. Student’s unpaired t-test: ****p < 0.0001, **p < 0.01. C Z-stacked confocal
  microscopy images of LIM2405 cells treated with 15 μM BZA in the presence of 30 ng/ml
  IL-11 for 24 hours showing morphological characteristics of apoptotic cell death.
  D Z-stacked confocal microscopy images of LIM2405 cells treated with 15 μM BZA alone
  and 15 μM BZA + 50 μM QVD (in the presence of 30 ng/ml IL-11) for 8 hours and stained
  with TO-PRO-3-iodide (red) and DAPI (blue) showing early stages of apoptotic cell
  death. E Apoptotic pathway protein expression in LIM2405 cells treated with 15 μM
  BZA in the presence of 30 ng/ml IL-11 treatment for 24 hours. Data is the mean ± SD
  of n = 2 replicates. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two way ANOVA with
  Tukeys multiple comparisons test. P-values are indicated in Supplementary table
