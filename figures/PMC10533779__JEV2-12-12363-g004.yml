caption: 'Deserpidine reduces the expression of miR‐146a‐5p in vitro and reduces the
  viability and proliferation of MBM cells. (a) Schematic representation of the 3D
  structure of the miR‐146a‐5p binding site for high‐throughput molecular docking
  analysis. (b) Schematic representation of the top 3 binding partners of miR‐146a‐5p
  available for purchase and predicted to cross the blood brain barrier. (c) qPCR
  analysis of miR‐146a‐5p expression in H1 cells and EVs after deserpidine treatment.
  (d) Representative IC50 survival curve of H1 cells after treatment with increasing
  drug concentrations (0.01–150 μM) for 72 h and corresponding deserpidine IC50 doses
  of all MBM cell lines and NHA. (e) Representative images from wound healing assay
  of H1 cells after treatment with various concentrations of deserpidine and quantification
  of % wound closure at 72 h. Scale bar = 300 μm. (f) Annexin V‐FITC and PI staining
  to assess apoptosis by flow cytometry in H1 cells treated with increasing concentrations
  of deserpidine for 72 h and corresponding quantification of live cell and apoptotic
  cell populations (Q2 + Q3) represented as percentage of total cell population. All
  data displayed from three independent experiments. Quadrant 1: Live cells. Quadrant
  2: Early apoptosis. Quadrant 3: Late apoptosis. Quadrant 4: Necrosis. n.s.= not
  significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. N = 3.'
