figure_title: In silico screen and mRNA-seq revealed ADA and PDK1 as metabolic reprogramming
  genes that induce immune response-related transcriptomic changes in CD8 T cells
caption: A, Flowchart of the multi-tier selection for identification of candidate
  genes that modulate T cell metabolism.B, Schematic of mutant T cell and CAR T cell
  generation, multi-omics profiling and functional analyses.C-D, Quantification of
  CRISPR-mediated indel formation to ADA and PDK1 genes. Sample sequences and indel
  statistics are displayed in C and D, respectively.E, Heatmap of significant differentially
  expressed (DE) transcripts in ADA-gRNA11 or PDK1-gRNA13 T cells.F-G, Volcano plots
  of differential expression (DE) in (F) ADA-gRNA11 or (G) PDK1-gRNA13 T cells. Expression
  fold-changes and significance are represented by the beta-value and q value, respectively.H-I,
  Waterfall plots of significantly enriched Biological Process ontologies in (H) ADA-gRNA11
  or (I) PDK1-gRNA13 T cells. Results are shown for pathway analyses of DE genes,
  and significance is provided as the Benjamini-adjusted p value (adj. p). Enrichment
  was assessed separately for up- and down-regulated genes, but results are shown
  together. DE genes had a beta-change > 1 and q < 0.05. Indel quantification and
  DE were analyzed with 3 biological replicates for each condition.
