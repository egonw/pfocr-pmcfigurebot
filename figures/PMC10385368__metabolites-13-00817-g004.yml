caption: Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor–beta subunit (IGF1-Rβ) epitope expression
  after treatment with sucralose and additional insulin or levodopa treatment. Three
  concentrations of sucralose were used (0.2 mM, 2 mM and 20 mM). Epitope levels were
  calculated from signal intensity and presented as ratio of signal intensity to 0
  mM sucralose/No additional treatment group. Two-way ANOVA sucralose treated groups,
  F(6,36) = 33.171, p < 0.0001; post HOC test Tukey HSD with p-value set at p < 0.05.
  Groups bearing the same letter above the graph are not statistically different.
