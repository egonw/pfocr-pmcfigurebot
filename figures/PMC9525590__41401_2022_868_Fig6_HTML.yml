figure_title: CFTR-mediated [Cl−]i regulates platelet aggregation via SGK1 activation
caption: a, b [Cl−]i in platelets from CftrPKO (a), CftrPOE (b), and corresponding
  age-matched Ctrl mice (n = 10 mice per group; unpaired t test). c, Real-time change
  of platelets [Cl−]i was measured in WT mice incubated with or without 5 μM CFTRinh-172
  (n = 10 per group; unpaired t test). d Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated
  SGK1 (S422) expressions in WT platelets stimulated with varying [Cl−]i levels (n = 5
  independent experiments; one-way ANOVA). e, f Western blot analysis of total and
  phosphorylated SGK1 (S422) expressions in CftrPKO (e), CftrPOE (f), and their corresponding
  Ctrl platelets (n = 6 mice per group; unpaired t test). g, Western blot analysis
  of total and phosphorylated SGK1 (S422) expressions in platelets from patients with
  CAD and NCA subjects. (NCA, n = 32 vs. CAD, n = 30; unpaired t test). h Aggregation
  of CftrPKO or Ctrl platelets stimulated with various concentrations of ADP (2.5,
  5, and 10 μM) or thrombin (0.02 U/mL) following in vitro pre-incubation with/without
  GSK-650394 (1 μM) for 30 min. Representative tracings and quantification graphs
  are shown (n = 6 mice per group; unpaired t test). Data are mean ± SEM; **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant.
