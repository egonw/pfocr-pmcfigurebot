figure_title: Molecular profiles of inflammatory tumor epithelial cells from immunotherapy-treated
  cohort of NMU-induced tumors
caption: 'A, Gene set enrichment analysis between growing vs. stable tumors in CD45+,
  DN (double negative), and EpCAM+ cells using the MSigDB Hallmark compendium. Red
  and blue indicates stable and growing enriched, respectively, FDR<0.05. B, Normalized
  single sample gene set enrichment scores (ssGSEA NES) of significant pathways in
  EpCAM+ cells of each tumor. Inset, gene expression row z-scores of genes in the
  IL6–JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway. Hyper-inflammatory tumors indicated in purple C,
  Immunofluorescence analysis of inflammatory and non-inflammatory tumors for CD8,
  SMA, and CD74. Scale bar, 50 μm. D, Comparison of CD8+ T cell frequency and intermixing
  with EpCAM+ cells in hyperinflammatory and non-inflammatory tumors in WSI. Quartiles
  and range are shown. p-values were calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum test. E, Spearman
  correlation of CD74 expression with leukocyte infiltration and TCR diversity in
  the TCGA breast cancer cohort (N=1054 complete observations). F, Forest plot showing
  hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals from multivariable Cox regression analysis
  using CD74 gene expression z-score, PAM50 subtype and tumor stage in TCGA breast
  cancer cases. Log-rank test p-value: 3 ×10−9. All tests for significance used Mann
  Whitney Wilcoxon test using a threshold of p=0.05 unless otherwise specified; error
  bars representative of SD; box-whisker plots indicate 0 th, 25th, 50th, 75th and
  100th percentiles.'
