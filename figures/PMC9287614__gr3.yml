caption: 'CaMKII isoforms phosphorylation and total CaMKII δDin human skeletal muscle
  in response to incremental exercise to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia,
  and post-exercise ischaemia. Levels of protein expression of (A) pThr287 CaMKII
  βM, (B) pThr287 CaMKII γ, (C) pThr287 CaMKII δA, (D) pThr287 CaMKII δD and (E) Total
  CaMKII δD. Nx: normoxia session (FIO2 = 0.21, PIO2 = 143 mmHg); Hyp: severe normobaric
  hypoxia session (FIO2 = 0.104, PIO2 = 73 mmHg); Pre: before exercise; Post: 10 s
  after exercise cessation during ischaemic recovery; Oc1m: 60 s after exercise cessation
  during ischaemic recovery; FC1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during recovery with
  free circulation. n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9), Post Hyp
  (n = 10) and FC1m (n = 10). See  for a detailed description of the experimental
  phases. The statistical analysis was performed with logarithmically transformed
  data for pThr287 CaMKII βM, pThr287 CaMKII δA and Total CaMKII δD. Values presented
  are means ± standard errors and expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.). †p < 0.05 vs.
  Pre Nx; *p < 0.05 vs. Pre Hyp; §p < 0.05 vs. Oc1m Hyp.'

  muscle revealed by high-intensity exercise and ischaemia at exhaustion: Role of
