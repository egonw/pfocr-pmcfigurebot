caption: Simplified apoptosis schemes for vertebrates and nematodes. (a) The 17 members
  of the Bcl-2 family of M. musculus are indicated in the three classes. (b) The Ecdysozoan
  C. elegans apoptosis scheme is much simplified compared to that in mammals bearing
  a single Bcl-2 protein CED-9 and BH3-only protein EGl-1. The result of either signalling
  pathway is the activation of caspases that dismantle the cell.
