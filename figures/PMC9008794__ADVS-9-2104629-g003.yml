caption: 'Effect of 630‐nm brain PBM using a multi‐LED array on AIM2 inflammasome
  and pyroptosis in the hippocampus and cortex following ischemic brain injury. a,b)
  Representative photographs and quantification graphs of AIM2+/Cas‐1+ and c,d) GSDMD
  (pyroptosis marker). AIM2 and GSDMD were labeled with red fluorescence, Cas‐1 was
  labeled with green fluorescence and DAPI was labeled with blue fluorescence. Quantification
  of AIM2+/Cas‐1+ and GSDMD fluorescence integrated optical density in the hippocampus
  and cortex. Scale bar = 50 µm. All data are represented as mean ± SEM. N = 3 each.
  Statistical significance was determined using a one‐way ANOVA with a Tukey post
  hoc test. ***p < 0.001 versus sham/control group; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 versus
  stroke/control group. e) Schematic illustration of the effect of 630 nm brain PBM
  on AIM2 inflammasome signaling pathway. Brain PBM may prevent the neuroinflammation
  and pyroptotic cell death via inhibiting the activation of AIM2 inflammasome and
  related signaling pathway.'
