caption: CS‐B‐NO hydrogel inhibited NF‐κB inflammatory signaling pathway by regulating
  local ROS/NO balance after myocardial I/R injury. A) Macrophage polarization was
  detected by immunofluorescence staining targeting iNOS and CD206, the markers of
  M1 and M2 macrophage phenotype, respectively (scale bar = 50 µm). B,C) Representative
  Western blot images and quantitative data showing the expression of IL‐10, Arg‐1,
  CD206, IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, iNOS, NF‐κB, IKK, p‐IKK, IκBα, and p‐IκBα, in the hearts
  after I/R injury with different treatments. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, n
  = 5 animals for each group, Significant differences were detected by one‐way ANOVA
  with Tukey's multiple comparisons tests, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001.
  D) Schematic illustration summarizing the mechanism of CS‐B‐NO hydrogel on inhibiting
  the NF‐κB signaling pathway after I/R injury.
