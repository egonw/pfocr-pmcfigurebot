caption: 'MK-2206 reduced myofibroblast formation and the deposition of extracellular
  matrix in UUO mice and TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells. (A–C) Immunofluorescence staining
  and Western blot analysis of Vimentin, α-SMA in kidney tissues (scale bar: 100 μm).
  (D–F) Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis of Vimentin, α-SMA in
  HK-2 cells (scale bar: 100 μm). (G) Western blot was used to detect the protein
  expression levels of Collagen I and Fibronectin in the kidney of each group of mice.
  (H) Protein expression levels of Collagen I and Fibronectin in HK-2 cells were detected
  by Western blot. Protein levels were normalized with GADPH. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001. MU: UUO+ MK-2206, MT: TGF-β1 + MK-2206.'
