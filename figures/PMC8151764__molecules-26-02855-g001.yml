caption: Putative taxol biosynthetic pathway. (A) The source and formation of the
  taxane core. (B) The modification of the core taxane skeleton. (C) The synthesis
  of the Î²-phenylalanyl-CoA side chain and the assembly of taxol. The solid arrows
  show the identified steps. The dotted arrows show the unknown steps. Steps marked
  by red color represent the uncharacterized enzymatic reactions. Dotted frame represents
  intermediate steps of the pathway where several enzymes and the order of their reactions
  are unknown.
