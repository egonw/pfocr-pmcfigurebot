caption: Interactions between NKT cells and hepatocytes, dendritic cells, Kupffer
  cells, and B cells. (A) Hepatocytes present lipid antigens to TCR on NKT cells via
  the CD1d-dependent pathway; hepatocytes release IL-7 to activate NKT cells; NKT
  cells secrete TNF-α that has dual functions on hepatocytes; NKT cells express FasL
  and induce Fas expression on hepatocytes, leading to apoptosis of hepatocytes. (B)
  NKT cells secrete IFN-γ to recruit T cells to kill hepatocytes. (C) B cells present
  lipid antigens to NKT cells through CD1d; NKT cells and B cells contact each other
  directly through CD40L/CD40 and CD28/CD80, 86; NKT cells secrete IL-21 and IFN-γ
  to promote B cells. (D) Kupffer cells present lipid antigens to TCR on NKT cells
  via the CD1d-dependent pathway; Kupffer cells express LFA-1 and SIRPα, which bind
  with ICAM-1 and CD47, respectively, on NKT cells to activate NKT cells; Kupffer
  cells secrete IL-12, IL-1β, IL-15, and AIM to recruit and promote NKT cells; NKT
  cells in return produce pro-inflammatory IL-4 and IFN-γ to function on Kupffer cells.
  Notably, over-stimulation of NKT cells by Kupffer cells leads to apoptosis of NKT
  cells. (E) Dendritic cells (especially myeloid dendritic cells, mDC) present lipid
  antigens via CD1d towards NKT cells to activate NKT cells; dendritic cells secrete
  IL-27 and IL-12 to activate NKT cells; NKT cells express CD40L to bind with CD40L
  and reciprocally benefit dendritic cells. mDC, myeloid dendritic cells; IL, interleukin;
  TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon; SIRP, signal regulatory protein; LFA,
  lymphocyte function-associated antigen; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; AIM,
  apoptosis inhibitor expressed by macrophages.
