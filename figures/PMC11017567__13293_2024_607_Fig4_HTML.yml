caption: Mid-range TI values exhibit distinct pathway signatures relative to the sex
  and gender â€“ defined poles. (A) (Left Panel) Heatmap of pathway activation signatures
  underlying changes in midrange TI values for female adult cancers relative to their
  pole. (Right Panel) Heatmap of pathway activation signatures underlying changes
  in midrange TI values for male adult cancers relative their pole. (B) (Left Panel)
  Heatmap of pathway activation signatures underlying changes in midrange TI values
  for pediatric female cancers relative to their pole. (Right Panel) Heatmap of pathway
  activation signatures underlying changes in midrange TI values for pediatric male
  cancers relative their pole. For all panels, changes in male (blue circles) and
  female (red circles) signatures are indicated. Gene counts (count) are symbolized
  by the size of the circles and False Discovery Rates (FDR) by the saturation of
  the fill as indicated in the legends. Only cancer types and pathways with significant
  change are shown
