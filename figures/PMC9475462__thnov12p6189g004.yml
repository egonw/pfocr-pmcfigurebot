caption: 'ARHGAP24 represses the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. A. Differential
  genes (DEGs) were identified when ARHGAP24 high group (upper quarter) was compared
  to ARHGAP24 low group (lower quarter) in TCGA dataset according to follow criteria:
  p value < 0.05 and |log2 fold change (FC)| > 1. B. Bubble plot revealed significantly
  enriched Wnt/β-catenin-related signaling according to Reactome pathway analysis.
  C. GSEA analysis demonstrated highly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling especially
  the transcriptional activity were enriched in ARHGAP24-low subgroup. D. The transcriptional
  activity of β-catenin in indicated cells received distinct treatment was analyzed
  by TOP/FOP Flash assays. E. The mRNA expressions of downstream target genes of β-catenin
  were detected by qRT-PCR assay. F. The mRNA (upper panel) and protein (lower panel)
  expression of downstream target genes of β-catenin were determined in HCCLM3 cells
  in the presence of ICG-001, a specific antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. G. Effects
  of ICG-001 on the long-term proliferation potentials of HCCLM3 cells assessed by
  colony formation assays. H. Effects of ICG-001 treatment on the migration and invasion
  capacities of HCCLM3 cells were determined by Transwell and scratch wound healing
  assays. I. Effects of ICG-001 on the migration capacities of ARHGAP24-knockdown
  Li-7 cells were assessed by Transwell and scratch wound healing assays. J. mRNA
  (upper panel) and protein (lower panel) expressions of downstream target of β-catenin
  in Li-7 cells received indicated treatment were detected by qRT-PCR and WB assays.
  K. Effects of ICG-001 on the proliferation of ARHGAP24-knockdown Li-7 cells were
  evaluated using colony formation assays.'
