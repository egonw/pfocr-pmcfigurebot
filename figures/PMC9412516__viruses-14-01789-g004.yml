caption: GO enrichment and subcellular localization analyses of the differentially
  expressed ubiquitinated proteins in CWMV-infected wheat. These ubiquitinated proteins
  were significantly enriched in biological processes (A), molecular functions (B),
  and cellular components (C). The Rich factor indicated the ratio of the differentially
  expressed ubiquitinated proteins to all gene numbers annotated in this pathway term.
  The Q-value is the corrected p-value, ranging from 0 to 1, with lower values suggesting
  greater intensiveness. The circles represent the number of enriched genes, with
  the larger circles indicating more enriched genes. (D) Subcellular localization
  of all the identified ubiquitinated proteins.
