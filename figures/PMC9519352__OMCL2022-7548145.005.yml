caption: 'KAN0438757 (KAN) ameliorated the progression of intervertebral disc degeneration
  (IVDD) in a rat tail disc puncture model in vivo. (a) The rat coccyx vertebrae X-ray
  images at 4 weeks after treatment from each group. (b) Quantitative analysis of
  disc height index (DHI, %) of IVDs in mice at 4 weeks after treatment in each group.
  n = 6. (c) Hematoxylin and eosin staining and safranin O-fast green staining of
  intervertebral discs (IVDs) from each group at 4 weeks after treatment. Scale bar
  = 500 μm and 200 μm. (d) Quantitative analysis of histological scores of IVDs in
  mice at 4 weeks after treatment in each group. n = 6. (e) Interleukin- (IL-) 1β
  and Col2a1 immunofluorescence staining of IVDs from each group at 4 weeks after
  treatment. Scale bar = 100 μm. (f, g) Quantitative analysis of IOD (IL-1β and Col2a1)
  of IVDs in mice at 4 weeks after treatment in each group. n = 5. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ns: no significance; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p <
  0.0001.'
