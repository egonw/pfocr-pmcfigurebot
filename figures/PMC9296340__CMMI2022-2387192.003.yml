caption: 'Western blotting to verify the expression levels of CCL3, CCR5, and the
  TRAF6/NF-κB pathway-related factors in colorectal cancer tissues: (a) the expression
  level of CCL3 in different colorectal cancer tissues; (b) a graph of the expression
  level of CCR5 in different colorectal cancer tissues; (c) changes in the expression
  level of NF-κB in different colorectal cancer tissues; (d) a graph of changes in
  the expression of TRAF6 in different colorectal cancer tissues; and (e) changes
  in the expression level of PI3K in different colorectal cancer tissues.'
