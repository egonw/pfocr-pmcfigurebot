caption: A combination of Z734 and lapatinib inhibits the growth of breast cancer.
  (A) MCF–7 cells were incubated with Z734 (10 μM) and/or lapatinib (0.5 μM), and
  p–ERK2, ERK2, p–p53, p53 and HERC3 protein expressions were detected by WB. (B)
  Representative images of ERK2 and p53 immunofluorescence staining in MCF–7 treated
  with Z734 (10 μM) or lapatinib (0.5 μM). DAPI was used to stain the nuclei. Quantification
  of fluorescence was performed on the Average Optical Density using the ImageJ software.
  Scale bars = 10 μm. (C) ELISA was used to detect the expression levels of Ki67 in
  MCF–7 to reflect cell proliferation after Z734 and/or lapatinib treatment. (D) Caspase3
  activities in overexpressing of ERK2 in MCF–7 treated with Z734 (10 μM) and/or lapatinib
  (0.5 μM) were detected. (E) MCF–7 were treated with Z734 (10 μM) and/or lapatinib
  (0.5 μM) for 12 h, followed by flow cytometry to detect cell apoptosis. (F) Migration
  of MCF–7 cells were evaluated using the transwell assay after being treated with
  Z734 (10 μM) and/or lapatinib (0.5 μM). Scale bars = 20 μm. (G) Body weights of
  female Balb/c mice with different treatment groups (n = 5 for Control group; n =
  5 for Z734 group; n = 5 Lapatinib group; n = 5 for Z734 + Lapatinib group). (H)
  Picture (n = 5 for Control group; n = 5 for Z734 group; n = 5 Lapatinib group; n
  = 5 for Z734 + Lapatinib group, combined results of 2 independent experiments) of
  MCF–7 breast tumor across four groups. (I,J) The volumes (I) and weights (J) were
  measured and quantified (n = 5 for Control group; n = 5 for Z734 group; n = 5 Lapatinib
  group; n = 5 for Z734 + Lapatinib group). Data shown in (B–G,I,J) were used one–way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
