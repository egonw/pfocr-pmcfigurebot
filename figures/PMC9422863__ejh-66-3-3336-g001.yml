caption: APLN was highly expressed in esophageal cancer. A) RT-PCR was used to measure
  the mRNA levels of APLN in normal tissue (n=11) and primary tumors (n=184). B) The
  survival rate of the184 patients with esophageal cancer in the following 3,000 days;
  46 patients with esophageal cancer had high expression of APLN and the rest of the
  138 patients with esophageal cancer had low or medium expression of APLN.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
