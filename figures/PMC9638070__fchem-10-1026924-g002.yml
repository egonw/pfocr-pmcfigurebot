  of MnPB NPs. (B) Temperature profiles of MnPB NPs at different concentrations under
  laser irradiation (C) The temperature changes of MnPB NPs (irradiation heating and
  natural cooling) at 200 μg/ml concentrations (D) linear regression for the naturing
  cooling process. (E) Degradation of MB with the treatment of MnPB NPs and H2O2.
  (F) Absorption of MB in two groups at 664 nm.
