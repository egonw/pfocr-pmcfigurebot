caption: 'Damage response of glial cells in the eye discs of Drosophila melanogaster.(A)
  Scanning electron microscope image of an adult eye of Drosophila. (B, C) Third instar
  eye discs stained with anti-Elav (red) and Phalloidin to visualize F-actin (yellow).
  Control undamaged disc (B) and eye discs after inducing neural apoptosis (C). (D,
  E) X–Z projections show cross-sections perpendicular to the furrow of a control
  (D) and a damaged (E) eye disc. The expression of UAS-GFP (green) under the control
  of repo–Gal4 is restricted to glial cells (anti-repo in blue). Photoreceptors are
  stained with anti-Elav (red). (D) In control discs, subretinal glial cells are located
  in the basal layer of the disc. (E) In damaged discs, we observed glial cells in
  the basal layers, as well as in the middle and apical layers. We even found that
  some glial cells contact photoreceptors (anti-Elav in red). (F–I) After inducing
  neural damage wrapping glial cells change their morphology. (F, G) Control wrapping
  glial cells. (H, I) In damaged eye discs, glial cells produce large cellular projections
  that can generate complex structures. (J–L) Model representing the signaling network
  involved in the activation of glial response after cell death induction in eye discs.
  (J) In control eye discs Dpp is expressed (green) ahead of the MF, whereas Hh is
  expressed (purple) in the interommatidial and photoreceptors cells (in red), behind
  the MF. JNK is active (pink) in the glial cells (in blue) and the retina. (K, L)
  When neural apoptosis is induced, the expression of Hh and Dpp increase in the damaged
  region, and in turn these signaling pathways are activated in glial cells. The activity
  of these pathways induces glial cell proliferation and migration and activates the
  JNK pathway that facilitates glial migration and engulfment. Dpp: Decapentaplegic;
  Elav: embryonic lethal abnormal vision; GFP: green fluorescent protein; Hh: Hedgehog;
  JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MF: morphogenetic furrow; Repo: reversed polarity;
  WG: wrapping glia. Unpublished data.'
