caption: 'Target enrichment analysis of hub miRNAs using the KEGG pathway database.
  The top 10 KEGG pathways with high significance levels were plotted. The bar graph
  represents -log2 (adjusted p value) of each KEGG pathway, and the red dot represents
  the number of target genes belonging to each term. The number of significantly enriched
  signaling pathways was less than 10 in NT 1H-12H and 12H NT-T. The full list of
  results is shown in Appendix . NT 1H: nontrauma extraction socket after one hour;
  T 1H: trauma extraction socket after one hour; NT 12H: nontrauma extraction socket
  after 12 hours; T 12H: trauma extraction socket after 12 hours. NT 1H-12H: comparison
  between NT 1H and NT 12H; T 1H-12H: comparison between T 1H and T 12H; 1H NT-T:
  comparison between NT 1H and T 1H; 12H NT-T: comparison between NT 12H and T 12H.'
