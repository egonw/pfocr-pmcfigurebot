caption: 'NBP significantly suppressed RCIR-induced microglial cell activation and
  regeneration, but not Nrf2−/− mice. (a) Representative images of double immunofluorescence
  labeling of Iba-1 (red) and BrdU (green) (200×) in hippocampal CA1 regions of WT
  and Nrf2−/− mice 4 weeks after RCIR. Iba-1+/BrdU+ cells represented microglial proliferation.
  Typical double-labeled areas were magnified. Bar = 50 μm. n = 4 in each group. (b)
  The number of Iba-1+/BrdU+ cells in hippocampal CA1 regions. (c, d) Western blot
  analysis of Iba-1 expressions. n = 6 in each group. β-Actin was used as an internal
  control. ###P < 0.001, the WT + NBP120 vs. the WT + RCIR group; &P < 0.05, the Nrf2−/−
  + RCIR group vs. the WT + RCIR group; ns: not significant, as indicated. Values
  are expressed as mean ± SD.'
