caption: Screening and identification of enzymes. (A) Hyperoside-induced flavonoid
  metabolism pathway in Gemstone seedless grape fruit.Yellow represents up-regulated
  and blue represents down-regulated. (B) Data on the genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis
  pathway that were downregulated. (C) The pathway process in which the enzyme is
  located. Heat map illustrating changes in the anthocyanin metabolic pathways-related
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after treatment with hyperoside. (D) The gene
  expression levels of three enzymes (VvPAL, VvCHS, and VvF3’5’H) were determined
  by RT-qPCR. P< 0.05 and P< 0.01 are denoted, respectively, by the symbols * and
  ***.
