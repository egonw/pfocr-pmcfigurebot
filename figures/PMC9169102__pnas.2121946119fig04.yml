caption: IP6K2 induced mitoprotection is kinase independent and suppresses PINK1-mediated
  mitophagy pathway. (A) Protein expressions of different mitophagic factors (BNIP3,
  BNIP3/Nix, PINK1, NDP52, SQSTM1/p62, Parkin, and optineurin) were determined through
  Western blot analyses of cell lysates of WT and K2-KD N2A cells. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of the protein expressions in A. (C) Analysis of mitophagy regulators in
  cerebellar lysates of WT and K2-KO mice of 6, 12, and 24 mo through protein expression
  assessment of PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II using Western blotting. Data are quantified
  and represented in the graphs depicted in SI Appendix, Fig. S2. (D) Full-length
  IP6K2 (K2) and IP6K2 kinase dead mutant (K222A) were transfected into K2-KD N2A
  cells. Representative immunoblots of the lysates from WT, K2-KD, and N2A cells transfected
  with K2 (K2-R) and K222A cells (K222A-R) were blotted against PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II
  antibodies. Immunoblot protein bands are quantified in E. (F) Full-length K2 was
  transfected in K2-SQSTM1/p62 and K2-PINK1 double-KD cells. Cell lysates from K2-KD
  cells, K2-SQSTM1/p62 double-KD cells, K2-PINK1 double-KD cells, and K2 supplemented
  SQSTM1/p62 and PINK1 cells were immunoblotted against LC3-II. The corresponding
  Western blot, as well as the quantitative analysis of protein bands, are depicted
  in F. (G) Scheme of IP6K2-mediated mitophagy regulation. Data are presented as mean
  Â± SD and are representative of three independent experiments performed under identical
  conditions. Significant differences are **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA. Further details of the experiment are described in .
