caption: Network built on the genes up-regulated in PKH26+ shared by the lung and
  colon systems. (A) Network visualization. It was built considering as connected
  only pairs of nodes with extremely elevated correlations (r > |0.98|). (B) Genes’
  projection in the Clustering coefficient/betweenness space. It refers to the network
  built considering the usual threshold of Pearson r = |0.7|. Genes linked to the
  TGF-β pathway are highlighted in blue.
