caption: The significantly enriched KEGG pathways in the high-risk group of the TCGA-UVM
  cohort and GSE22138 cohort determined by GSEA. Common upregulated KEGG-Proteasome
  pathway and KEGG-ABC transporters pathway in the high-risk group of the TCGA-UVM
  cohort (A) and GSE22138 cohort (B). (C) Six upregulated metabolism-related KEGG
  pathways in the TCGA-UVM cohort. (D) One upregulated metabolism-related KEGG pathway
  in the GSE22138 cohort. ABC, ATP-binding cassette.
