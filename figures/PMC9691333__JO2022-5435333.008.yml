caption: Circ_000448 overexpression stimulates cervical cancer development in vivo.
  (a) Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with an equivalent quantity of circ_000448-overexpressing
  HeLa cells or control cells. Tumor volumes (a) and weights (b) were measured. (c,
  d) In tumor xenograft experiments, the circ_000448 vector group had lower levels
  of miR-136 and higher levels of MEX3C than the control group. (e) The functions
  of the circ_000448/miR-136/MEX3C axis in cervical cancer chemoresistance are depicted
  in this schematic diagram. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
