figure_title: CRABP2 promoted oxaliplatin resistance through the BAX-dependent cell
  apoptosis pathway
caption: 'a After knocking down CRABP2/ BAX and adding OXA (concentration: AGS 0.2 μM,
  HGC-27 0.4 μM), the percentage of apoptotic cells was examined by flow cytometry.
  b After knocking down CRABP2/ BAX and adding OXA (concentration: AGS 0.2 μM, HGC-27
  0.4 μM), the activity of cleaved caspase 9 was examined. c After knocking down CRABP2/
  BAX and adding OXA (concentration: AGS 0.2 μM, HGC-27 0.4 μM), the expression of
  cleaved caspase 3/BAX/CRABP2 was examined by western blotting. d Schematic diagram
  of the experimental procedures of the cell-derived xenograft model in nude mice.
  e Photo showing tumor formation in the four groups of nude mice. Tumor weight (f)
  and tumor volumes (g) of four groups of nude mice. h The expression of CRABP2 and
  BAX in tumors from four groups of nude mice by western blotting. i HE and CRABP2
  IHC staining of tumors in four groups of nude mice. All experiments were performed
  in three replicates. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
