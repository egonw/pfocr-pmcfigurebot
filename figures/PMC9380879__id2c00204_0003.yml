caption: The SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell via an
  endosomal pathway or through fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.
  Briefly, viral entry is initiated by binding of the RBD of the spike (S) protein
  to the human host cell receptor (ACE2). After the RBD–receptor interaction, the
  S protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, which can be catalyzed by several host
  proteases, such as TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsin B/L. Following viral entry, SARS-CoV-2
  releases its genomic RNA into the cytoplasm and utilizes both the host’s and its
  own enzymatic machinery to replicate its genetic material and assemble new viral
  particles. The viral RNA genome is first translated into viral replicase polyproteins
  (pp1a and pp1ab), which are then cleaved into 16 nsps. In the process of genome
  replication and transcription mediated by the replication–transcription complex
  (RTC), the negative-sense (− sense) genomic RNA is synthesized and used as a template
  to generate a positive-sense (+ sense) genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs. Viral assembly
  is aided by the interaction between viral genomic RNA and structural proteins located
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).
  Finally, these virions are released to the plasma membrane via deacidified lysosomes
  and secreted from the infected cell via exocytosis. This figure was created with
