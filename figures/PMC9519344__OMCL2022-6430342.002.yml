caption: UPRmt is involved in cardiomyocyte mitochondrial homeostasis dysregulation
  and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mitochondrial ROS-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress
  is activated during the initial stages of myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
  The mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP) is further activated,
  which induces an imbalance between the inner and outer mitochondrial environment,
  which in turn leads to a massive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
  and dysfunction of mitochondrial energy metabolism. This process activates the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis, which in turn leads to cell death or apoptosis/necroptosis.
  UPRmt can be further activated under mild stress stimulation. Repairing mildly compromised
  mitochondrial oxidative stress damage or dysfunction, UPRmt can clear misfolded
  proteins (chaperones) or cleavage proteases. Unrepairable mitochondria may further
  undergo mitophagy, and mitochondrial DNA renewal and regeneration occurs through
  mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial biosynthesis.
