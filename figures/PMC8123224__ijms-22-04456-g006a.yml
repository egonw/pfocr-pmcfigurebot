caption: Functional enrichment analysis for DEGs using ClueGO. Functional enrichment
  for down-regulated DEGs showed that glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic process (A) was
  affected. Besides, the up-regulated DEGs activated various pathways, including (B)
  C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways, protein digestion and absorption, proteoglycans
  in cancer, arrhythmogenic right venticular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), primary immunodeficiency,
  adipocytokine signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway; (C) relaxin signaling pathway
  and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; (D) Malaria, JAK-STAT signaling pathway,
  human papillomavirus infection, NF-kappa B signaling pathway; (E) Staphylococcus
  aureus infection; (F) TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,
  and pertussis; (G) Influenza A, Herpes simplex virus 1 infection, and bladder cancer.
  Moreover, a series of pathways were affected by all DEGs (include Up-regulated and
  down-regulated DEGs), including (H) AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,
  malaria, Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), nicotinate and nicotinamide
  metabolism, amoebiasis, small cell lung cancer, African trypanosomiasis, prison
  diseases, bladder cancer, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, protein digestion
  and absorption, pertussis, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, proteoglycans in cancer,
  arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), platelet activation, necroptosis,
  osteoclast differentiation, apoptosis, complement and coagulation cascade, NOD-like
  receptor signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, C-type lection receptor
  signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, transcriptional misregulation in cancer,
  adipocytokine signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway,
  and primary immunodeficiency. (I) TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and pyrimidine
  metabolism. (J) Legionellosis and human papillomavirus infection. (K) Type I diabetes
  mellitus, Herpes simplex virus 1 infection, Epsteinâ€“Barr virus infection, autoimmune
  thyroid disease, and Leishmaniasis.
