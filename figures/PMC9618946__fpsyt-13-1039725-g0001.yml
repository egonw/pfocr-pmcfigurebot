caption: The mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system. (A) Sagittal view of the mesocorticolimbic
  dopamine pathway and its principal target nuclei in the mouse (upper) and human

  from the VTA described so far during the progression of AD (see text for details).
  Representations are adapted from the mouse and human brain atlas (Allen Institute).
