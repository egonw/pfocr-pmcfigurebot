caption: Interaction network diagram of StSROs and motif analysis and prediction of
  cis-acting elements of promoter. (A) Network analysis of interactions between StSROs
  and other proteins. Each circle represents a protein, the size of the circle represents
  the number of interactions between StSROs and other proteins, the connection between
  the two circles represents the interaction between the two; the protein of StSROs
  were represented by orange circles, and related proteins are represented by green
  circles. Transcription factors are indicated by red circles and unlabeled proteins
  are indicated by purple circles, as detailed in . (B) Targeted interactions between
  StSROs and miRNAs. StSRO family members were represented by red circles, and the
  number of connections between each circle indicates the number of interactions.
  Abiotic stress-associated miRNAs were represented by purplish red circles, and biological
  stress-associated miRNAs are represented by green circles. (C) Proportion of plant
  growth and development. (D) Proportion of plant hormone responsive cis-elements.
  (E) Proportion of the number of cis-elements associated with abiotic stress. (F)
  Cis-acting elements of StSROs, as detailed in .
