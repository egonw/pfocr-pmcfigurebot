caption: Melatonin receptor signaling pathways. (A) Both melatonin receptors MT1 and
  MT2 trigger toxin-sensitive Gαi and -insensitive Gq proteins, decreasing cAMP levels,
  protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, and CREB phosphorylation. The MT1 receptor also
  stimulates Gβγ-dependent PI3K/Akt and PKC/ERK pathways, in addition to activating
  the Gq-dependent PLC pathway and increasing intracellular levels of Ca2+. Moreover,
  MT1 mediates the activation of K+ channels (Kir3) and Ca2+ channels (Cav2.2). The
  MT2 receptor also stimulates Gαi-dependent PKC/ERK signaling and decreases intracellular
  cGMP levels. (B) Melatonin receptor homodimer and heterodimer signaling. MT1/MT1
  homodimers mediate intracellular signaling mainly via the Gi pathway rather than
  the Gq pathway, while MT2/MT2 homodimers signal exclusively via the Gi-dependent
  pathway. MT1/MT2 heterodimers mainly trigger Gq activation rather than Gi signal.
  The formation of the MT1/GPR50 dimer prevents the binding of MT1 to melatonin and
  blocks Gi signaling. The MT2/5-HT2c heterodimer stimulates 5-HT2C-mediated Gq signaling
  through MT2 transactivation. Kir3, G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium
  channel; Cav2.2, voltage-gated calcium channel; CREB, cAMP-responsive element binding;
  sGC, soluble GC.
