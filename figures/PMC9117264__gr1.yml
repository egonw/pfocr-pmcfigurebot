caption: Pipeline individualized pathway activity algorithm. A total of 10528 tumour/normal
  samples of 33 cancer types in the TCGA cohort were included in this study. Our algorithm
  begins with quantifying expression level of each gene in individual samples. For
  a given sample, the expression values of 19833 genes were ranked from small to large,
  and the ordering value was regarded as the expression level of genes. In order to
  reduce the effects caused by small changes of gene expression on the whole level
  of pathway activity and highlight the influence of genes with large changes on expression
  level, the gene ranks with the same tens digit were regarded as the same level and
  assigned as same scores. Pathway activities were then calculated by summing the
  gene expression level for all genes within each of the pathways and dividing by
  the number of genes for that particular pathway, to account for gene number effects
  in different pathway. Finally, the pathway activities of 318 KEGG pathways in 10446
  TCGA samples were obtained for further analyses.
