caption: RBM10 promotes PTEN expression and inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway. A PTEN protein expression in oe-RBM10 and sh-RBM10 NSCLC cells
  by Western blot analysis, normalized to GAPDH. B Immunofluorescence qualitative
  analysis of PTEN protein expression (100 ×). The blue fluorescence represents the
  nucleus, the red fluorescence represents the PTEN protein, and the red fluorescence
  is mainly located in the cytoplasm. C The phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR
  in oe-RBM10 and sh-RBM10 NSCLC cells by Western blotting analysis, normalized to
  GAPDH. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Data are means ± SD
article_title: RBM10 regulates alternative splicing of lncRNA Neat1 to inhibit the
  invasion and metastasis of NSCLC.
