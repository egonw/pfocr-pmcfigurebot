caption: 'SRRM2 is associated with acute myeloid leukemia. (A) Expression of SRRM2
  mRNA in human normal tissues (upper heatmap) and cancers (lower graph). The normal
  tissues display SRRM2 expression from 0 to 370 Transcripts per Million (TPM), to
  show that SRRM2 was expressed at roughly the same level in most human normal tissues
  including bone marrow (highlighted in green) (data from The Human Protein Atlas).
  SRRM2 mRNA levels in cancers (after log2 transformation) show a specific upregulation
  in AML bone marrow when compared to other tumor or cancers (data from TCGA Research
  Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga). The increased SRRM2 expression in AML is
  not due to point mutations (very few red dots indicating samples with SRRM2 mutations).
  (B) Expression analyses on patient samples showing SRRM2 upregulation in bone marrow
  from different types of AML (data from BloodSpot) (). (C) Volcano plot showing log2
  fold change (log2FC) of RNA expression of splicing factors between knockdown and
  control in THP-1. We marked out with black color the significantly changed (log2FC > 1,
  q-value < 0.05) splicing factors, and representative splicing factors with other
  colors. (D) Numbers of live/dead cells upon SRRM2 knockdown in THP-1 cells. We cultured
  3000 virus-infected cells (72 h) for 2 days before counting cells. (E) GSEA analysis
  showing that knockdown of SRRM2 influenced G2M checkpoint. We compared gene expression
  of SRRM2 knockdown to scramble control, based on RNA-seq data. P-value = 0.0000,
  FDR = 0.0000. We used hallmark gene sets and gene ontology (GO) gene sets for this
  analysis. (F) FACS assay for detection of the THP-1 surface expression of CD14 and
  CD11b following shRNA mediated knockdown of splicing factors, without or with PMA
  treatment (10 ng/ml for 48 h). (G) Pathway analysis by KEGG, Reactome, and PANTHER
  showing that SRRM2 knockdown downregulates one carbon metabolism (serine metabolism)
  pathways. (H and I) Gene expression validation by qRT-PCR showing significant downregulation
  of genes that govern serine biogenesis (PHGDH, PSAT1) and mitochondrial 1-C metabolism/folate
  cycle pathways (MTHFD2) (H) and their upstream transcription factor ATF4 (I), upon
  SRRM2 but not SRRM1 knockdown. Data are mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 experiments). Statistical
  significance determined using one-way ANOVA test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
  ns: no significant difference).'
