caption: 'Analyses of CRS-related signalling pathways. Correlation between expressions
  of seven CSR genes involved in the CRS and important cancer signalling pathways
  in the (a) TCGA-BLCA and (b) validation cohorts. A cross in the pie chart shows
  P value > 0.05. (c) Wire map outlines the correlation between CSR genes and important
  cancer signalling pathways with statistical significance in the both cohorts. Solid
  lines represent activation of signalling pathways and dotted lines show inhibition.
  (d) Density map shows the difference of characteristic pathway scores between the
  high- and low-CRS subgroups in BLCA. GSVA enrichment analyses of high- and low-CRS-associated
  biological processes in the (e) TCGA-BLCA and (f) validation cohorts. The red font
  indicates common enriched processes in the cohorts. CRS: fibroblast common serum
  response risk score.'
