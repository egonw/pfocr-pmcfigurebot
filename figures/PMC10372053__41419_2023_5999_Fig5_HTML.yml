figure_title: CD8+ T cells are essential, phenotypically distinct in responding vs.
  nonresponding tumors, and require Type I IFN signaling
caption: A CD8+ T cells were depleted from tumor-bearing mice prior to SCRT treatment.
  B Tumor burden monitored by IVIS for 20 days. C DEGs between responding CD8+ T cells
  and nonresponding CD8+ T cells plotted on a hierarchical clustering heatmap. Blue
  box = nonresponders, green = responders, and pink = untreated. D Pathway heatmap
  of DEGs. N = 5 untreated and 10 irradiated (4 nonresponders, 6 responders) for sequencing
  wildtype CD8+ T cells. E CD8+ T cells from d14 irradiated tumors of mice treated
  with IFNAR blocking antibodies or IgG control. N = 6 IgG and 5 IFNAR treated. F
  Top 30 significantly downregulated pathways of CD8+ T cell from IFNAR-treated mice
  compared to IgG-treated mice. G Hierarchical clustering heatmap comparing CD8+ T
  cells from SCRT responders (blue box) from WT mice to SCRT nonresponders from WT
  mice including IFNAR treated CD8+ T cells (purple box).
