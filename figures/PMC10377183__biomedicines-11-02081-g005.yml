caption: Low-dose (0.5-Gy) radiation-induced HCC cells epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition
  via the CXCL6/CXCR2 signaling pathway. (A) Low-dose radiation significantly upregulated
  expression levels of CXCL6 protein, (B) CXCL6 mRNA, and (C) CXCR2 mRNA. (D) CXCR2
  inhibitor, AZD5069, significantly diminished the expression of vimentin after the
  application of low-dose radiotherapy. ***, p < 0.001, radiation (0.5 Gy) vs. control
  (0 Gy).
