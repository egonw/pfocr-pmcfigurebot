caption: 'Expression analysis of DEGs enriched in the plant-hormone signal transduction
  pathway. (A): DEGs enriched in the plant-hormone signal transduction pathway in
  C. vietnamensis leaves. AUX, auxin signal; CTK, cytokinin signal; ET, ethylene signal;
  JA, jasmonic acid signal; SA, salicylic acid; BR, brassinosteroid signal. Genes
  in red or blue refer to up- or downregulation responding to drought, respectively.
  Genes in purple refer to both up- and downregulation in response to drought. (B):
  Heatmap of plant-hormone signal transduction-related gene expression. Values are
  the average FPKM value of each sample in each group.'
