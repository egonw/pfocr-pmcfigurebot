caption: Knock-down of WISP1 attenuates the activation of TNFα on the cell migration
  and contraction in prostate fibroblast HPrF cells. (A) TNFα treatments (0–10 ng/mL)
  upregulated the WISP1 expression in HPrF cells determined by RT-PCR assays. (B)The
  quantitative analysis was presented as a relative density of WISP1v1 or WISP1v2/β-Actin.
  (C) Gene profile of the human prostate fibroblast HPrF cells after they were treated
  with 10 ng/mL of TNFα or TGFβ, as indicated. The protein levels of WISP1 (D) and
  IL-6 (E) in the conditioned media of HPrF cells treated with/without TNFα. (F) The
  ability of the proliferation of HPrF cells was measured by the CyQUANT cell proliferation
  assay kit after it was treated with various dosages of TNFα, as indicated, for 48
  h. (G) The ability of the migration of HPrF cells treated with/without 10 ng/mL
  of TNFα. The white line indicated the average of the cellular leading edges and
  the size of the wound area was calculated by ImageJ. (H) Data are presented as the
  mean percentage (±SE; n = 4) in relation to the vehicle-treated HPrF cells. (I)
  The ability of the contraction of HPrF_shCOL and HPrF_shWISP1 cells treated with/without
  10 ng/mL of TNFα. (J) Data are presented as the mean percentage (±SE; n = 3) of
  gel area in relation to the time 0. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
