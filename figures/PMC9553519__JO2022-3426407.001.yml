caption: Factors affecting tumor drug resistance. Quantitative and qualitative changes
  in drug influx and efflux systems affect the distribution of anticancer drugs throughout
  the body and their accumulation in tumor cells. The drug metabolism of the body
  determines the efficacy of drugs. DNA damage repair, activation of pro-survival
  pathway or oncogenic bypass pathway, and changes in the tumor microenvironment are
  the main influencing factors of drug resistance.
