figure_title: Reduced germinal centre homing and class switching of memory B cells
  in HIV viremic COVID-19 patients
caption: (A) Gating strategy for total switched memory (SM; CD27+ IgD-) and homing
  to germinal centres (CD62L+ CXCR5+) and comparison of SM with respect to HIV status.
  (B) Germinal centre homing capacity relative to HIV status and longitudinal comparison.
  Error bars indicate standard deviation (HIV- n = 37; HIV+ n = 33). (C) The SM was
  further gated on IgM and IgD to identify IgM+ memory and class switched (IgM-IgD-)
  B cells. Both responses were compared with respect to HIV status. Statistical analyses
  were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test for multiple comparisons. p Values
  are denoted by *â‰¤0.05; **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
