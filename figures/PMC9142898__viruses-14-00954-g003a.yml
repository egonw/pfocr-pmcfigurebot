caption: p65 may be a target of pseudorabies virus ICP0 protein. (A) PK15 cells were
  mock infected or infected with 1 MOI PRV for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 5 h. Then, cells
  were collected at the indicated time points. Western blot was performed for p65
  expression detection (Left). The expression of ICP0 mRNA was detected by RT-qPCR
  (Right). GAPDH served as loading control. (B) PK15 cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc
  empty vector (EV) (1.0 µg) or Myc-ICP0 (1.0 µg) plasmids for 24 h. Then, cells were
  harvested and lysed for Western blot detection. Factors included in the NF-κB signaling
  pathway such as TAK1, IκBα, pIκBα, p50 and p65 were detected. GAPDH served as loading
  control. The grey value of p65 relative to GAPDH was quantified. (C) PK15 cells
  were transfected with increasing concentrations of expression vectors for ICP0.
  After 24 h, cells were collected and lysed for p65 detection. GAPDH served as loading
  control. The grey value of p65 protein expression relative to GAPDH was also quantified.
  (D) PK15 cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc empty vector (EV) (1.0 µg) or Myc-ICP0
  (1.0 µg) plasmids for 24 h. Then, cells were treated with or without 50 ng/mL recombinant
  human TNF-α and incubated for an additional 12 h. Western blot was performed for
  TAK1, IκBα, pIκBα, p50 and p65 detection with the indicated antibodies. GAPDH served
  as loading control.
