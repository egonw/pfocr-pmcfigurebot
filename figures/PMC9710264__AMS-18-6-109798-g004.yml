caption: 'Hsa_circ_0017728 acted as a miRNA sponge for miR-149. The putative binding
  sites between hsa_circ_0017728 and miR-149 were predicted by online software Circinteractome
  (A). After transfection with miR-149 mimics and inhibitors into MKN-28 and MGC-803
  cells, miR-149 expression level was measured by RT-qPCR (B); luciferase reporter
  assays was performed in MKN-28 (C) and MGC-803 (D) cells co-transfected with WT
  or Mut hsa_circ_0017728. The expression level of miR-149 was measured using RT-qPCR
  in 55 pairs of tumor and non-cancerous tissues from GC patients (E). Spearmanâ€™s
  rank correlation analysis showed that the expression of miR-149 was inversely correlated
  with hsa_circ_0017728 in the 55 human GC tissues (F). Kaplan-Meier analysis was
  performed to evaluate the correlation between miR-149 expression and overall survival
  in GC patients (G)*P < 0.05, #p < 0.05 compared with corresponding control group.'
