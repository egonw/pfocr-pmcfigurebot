figure_title: Preparation and characterization of the biomimetic PEKK-B materials
caption: (A) Schematic illustration of the preparation of biomimetic PEKK scaffold.
  (B) In situ self-assembly of bone-like apatite nanoparticles on the microporous
  network of sulfonated PEKK scaffold. (C) Microcomputed tomography (μ-CT) reconstruction
  and (D) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation for various PEKK scaffolds
  and natural trabecular bone. (E) Typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and
  (F) corresponding surface roughness of PEKK scaffolds and natural trabecular bone.
  (G) Compressive strength of PEKK scaffolds and natural trabecular bone (error bars,
  means ± SD; n = 3 per group). All analyses were done using one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test.
