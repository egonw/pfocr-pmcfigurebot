caption: 'Putative mechanism of CIRP in cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.
  During cardiac surgery, CIRP is secreted into the circulation in response to hypothermia
  and hemodynamics change. Extracellular CIRP promotes the expression of NADPH oxidase
  in renal tubular epithelial cells via the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway and aggravates intracellular
  oxidative stress. ROS accumulation induces mitochondrial dynamics disorder, which
  ultimately increases apoptosis and promotes AKI. CIR: cold-inducible RNA-binding
  protein; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species.'
