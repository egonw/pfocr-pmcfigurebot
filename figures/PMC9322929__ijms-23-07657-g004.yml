caption: JIB-04 impairs the maintenance and viability of cancer stem-like cells in
  HCC cells. (A) CD133+/CD13+ subpopulations in PLC/PRF/5 cells after treatment with
  DMSO or 6 µM JIB-04 for 24 h were analyzed with flow cytometry analysis. Treatment
  with JIB-04 resulted in a decreased percentage of CD133+/CD13+ subpopulations compared
  with DMSO (control). Data are mean ± SEM of triplicate measurements; * p <0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. (B) Phase contrast image of tumorspheres derived
  from cells cultured with DMSO (control), 6µM JIB-04, or 4µM TSA for 24 h (Left panel).
  Percentage of sphere-initiating cells measured using CCK assay (Right panel). The
  number of DMSO-treated cells was set as 100 (n = 3). The data indicated that JIB-04
  reduces tumor-initiating ability in HCC cells. (C) Phase contrast image of primary
  tumorspheres after treatment with DMSO (control), 6µM JIB-04, or 4µM TSA for 2 days
  (Left panel). Viability of primary tumorspheres measured using CCK assay (Right
  panel). The number of DMSO-treated cells was set as 100 (n = 3). (D) Phase contrast
  image of secondary tumorspheres developed from primary tumorspheres without drug
  treatment for 12 days. Viability of secondary tumorspheres measured with CCK assay
  (Right panel). The number of DMSO-treated cells was set as 100 (n = 3). (E) Western
  blot analysis of histone methylation levels after treatment with DMSO or 6µM JIB-04
  for 24 h. H3 was used as a loading control. (F) The tumor-initiating ability of
  CSCs in PLC/PRF/5 cells was decreased due to the deficiency in KDM4B, KDM4D, and
  KDM6B. Phase contrast image of tumorspheres derived from KDM4B-, KDM4D-, or KDM6B-depleted
  knockdown cells (Left panel). Percentage of sphere-initiating cells measured with
  CCK assay (Right panel). The number of DMSO-treated cells was set as 100 (n = 3).
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM of triplicate measurements; * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
