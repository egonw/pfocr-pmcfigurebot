caption: 'Four possible mechanisms responsible for serum levels of histidine, leucine,
  ornithine, and phenylalanine in patients with LAHNSCC before concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
  They include: amount of dietary intake (①), consumption in the neutralization against
  oxidative and pro-inflammatory stress (②), fuel provider for energy production (③),
  and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)–nitric oxide (NO) pathway (④). First, reduced dietary
  intake directly results in decreased serum levels of essential amino acids (histidine,
  leucine, and phenylalanine). Second, essential amino acids are delivered into cells
  via L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1); once inside, they can neutralize the
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory mediators using their antioxidative
  and anti-inflammatory activities or enter into the Krebs cycle for energy production
  to compensate calorie deficiency from inadequate food intake. Finally, ROS and pro-inflammatory
  mediators can stimulate thrombopoiesis from mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow,
  inhibit lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, and upregulate NOS and NO
  production. Produced NO can decrease ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and
  increase the ornithine levels. The magnitude of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory
  mediators are reciprocally regulated by cancer and immune cells, such as regulatory
  T cells (Treg), macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), within
  the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood. ROS and pro-inflammatory
  mediators can reduce the function of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and prevent
  the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) are essential cofactors for the conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine
  and histidine into glutamate, respectively.'
