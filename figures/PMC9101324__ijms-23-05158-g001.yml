caption: 'Structure of Raf family kinases. All Raf isoforms comprise three conserved
  regions: conserved region 1 (CR1) contains a Ras-binding domain (RBD) and a Cys-rich
  domain (CRD); conserved region 2 (CR2) is characterized by a Ser/Thr-rich sequence
  where 14-3-3 binds and inhibits Raf; conserved region 3 (CR3) is the kinase domain
  where the B-Raf V600E mutation is found in cancer. At the C-terminus, the second
  site promotes dimerization via binding to 14-3-3. BRS is a B-Raf-specific site.
  The viral oncoproteins v-Raf and v-mil have amino-terminal truncations and are fused
  with the N-myristoylated (N-myr) viral Gag protein. Four conserved phosphorylation
  sites of each Raf isoform are indicated in rectangles, including 14-3-3 binding
  sites and phoshorylattion sites in the activation loop. NtA: N-terminal acidic region.'
