figure_title: lncRNA-GM promotes TH17 cell differentiation by activating mTORC1 signaling
caption: (A) Heatmap showing the representative up-regulated or down-regulated genes
  from WT and lncRNA-GM−/− TH17 cells (fold change > 1.5, P < 0.05). (B) qPCR analysis
  of Il17, Il17f, and Il23r mRNA expression in naïve T and TH17 cells (n = 3). (C)
  qPCR analysis of Foxp3, Il10rb, and Gpr83 mRNA expression in naïve T and iTreg cells
  (n = 3). (D) Cytometric bead array analysis of IL-17A and IL-17F in TH17 cell supernatants
  and IL-10 in iTreg cell supernatants from WT and lncRNA-GM−/− mice (n = 3 to 4).
  (E) Gene set enrichment analysis of TH17 cells from WT and lncRNA-GM−/− mice. (F)
  Heatmap showing down-regulated mTOR pathway–related genes in lncRNA-GM−/− TH17 cells
  (P < 0.05). (G) Immunoblot analysis of mTORC1 and downstream signaling pathway in
  WT and lncRNA-GM−/− naïve T, TH0 (α-CD3/CD28), and TH17 (α-CD3/CD28 plus IL-6 +
  TGF-β + IL-1β + IL-23) cells for 3 days. (H) Phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and
  4EBP1 was measured by flow cytometry from WT and lncRNA-GM−/− TH17 cells (n = 3
  to 4). (I and J) Flow cytometric analysis (I) and quantification (J) of CD4+ IL-17A+
  cells in WT and lncRNA-GM−/− TH17 cells after treatment with DMSO and 50 nM rapamycin
  (Rapa; n = 4). Naïve CD4+ T cells were cultured in vitro under optimal pathogenic
  TH17 cell polarizing conditions for 3 days. Results are presented as means ± SD
  (B, C, D, H, and J). One of three representative experiments is shown. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. FDR, false discovery rate. NES, normalized enrichment
  scores; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity.
