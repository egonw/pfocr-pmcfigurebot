caption: Identification of DEG, and KEGG and GSEA analysis. (A) Volcano plot of DEG
  in the GSE141804 dataset; (B) heat map of DEG in the GSE141804 dataset; (C) volcano
  plot of DEG in the GSE160932 dataset; (D) heat map of DEG in the GSE160932 dataset;
  (E) volcano plot of DEG in the GSE164400 dataset; (F) heat map of DEG in the GSE164400
  dataset; (G) KEGG functional enrichment analysis; (Hâ€“J) GSEA analysis. PI3K and
  MTOR signaling pathways were up-regulated in psoriasis, while AUTOPHAGY signaling
  pathway was down-regulated.
