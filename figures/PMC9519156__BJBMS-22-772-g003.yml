caption: 'Knockdown of Lkb1 promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation by activating YAP.
  (A) The volcano plot of bulk RNA-seq showing NRVMs transfected with Lkb1 siRNA (n
  = 3); (B) The gene ontology analysis of upregulated genes in NRMVs with Lkb1 silencing;
  (C) Genes which were associated with the YAP signaling pathway; (D-E) The Venn diagram
  revealed 116 overlap genes from the upregulated genes after Lkb1 knockdown and downregulated
  genes after Yap silencing; the gene ontology analysis is shown in E; (F) Western
  blotting of YAP in NRVMs transfected with Lkb1 siRNA or scramble control in F1;
  and the quantitative analysis of grayscale density in F2; (G) The confocal microscopy
  of Ki67- and pH3-positive cells in NRVMs transfected with Lkb1 siRNA, Yap siRNA,
  combined Lkb1 and Yap siRNA, and scramble control. The percentiles of Ki67+ or pH3+
  cardiomyocytes are shown in G2 (more than 2000 cells were randomly selected and
  analyzed for each group) (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. NRVMs: Neonatal
  rat ventricular myocytes; LKB1: Liver kinase B1; YAP: Yes-associated protein'
