caption: Transfection efficiency of bta-miR-199a-3p in the MAC-T cells. (A,C) The
  MAC-T cells were transfected with the bta-miR-199a-3p mimic (50 nM) or inhibitor
  (100 nM), and the transfection efficiency of the MAC-T cells was observed under
  an inverted fluorescence microscope. (B,D) The MAC-T cells were transfected with
  the miR-199a-3p mimic (50 nM) or inhibitor (100 nM), and the expression level of
  bta-miR-199a-3p was detected using qRT-PCR. GAPDH and RPS18 were used as the internal
  controls. * refers to p < 0.05, ** refers to p < 0.01.
