caption: 'Pathway analysis shows HG pulse induces organized upregulation of multicellular
  organism developmental, mechanotransduction, and DNA stress/repair pathways. (A)
  CPA results show three main GO pathways differentially regulated by hypergravity
  pulse stimulation in developmental model: green-blue coloring labels developmental
  pathways; navy-yellow coloring labels mechanotransduction and signal transduction
  pathways; and magenta-orange coloring label DNA damage and repair mechanism pathways
  (see legend). (Bâ€“D) Expression mapping for key genes in representative nodes of
  each of the three key regulatory processes upregulated by mechanical stimulation
  in the developmental model. (B) Genes key to developmental pathways, (C) genes key
  to mechanotransduction and signal transduction, and (D) are genes key to DNA damage
  and repair mechanisms. Results demonstrate that HG stimulation induces upregulation
  of many pathway genes in both EB and ESC models. However, the EBs respond with the
  greatest number of upregulated genes per pathway and greatest upregulation of individual
  genes in response to hypergravity pulse. CPA, consensus pathway analysis; GO, gene
  ontology.'
