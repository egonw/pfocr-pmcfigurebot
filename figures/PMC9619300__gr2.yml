  isotopologues and sensitivity to pemetrexed or pemetrexed/cisplatin in male (n =
  43) and female (n = 22) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Colored squares
  reached FDRadjusted p-value cut-off of 0.05.(B) Isotopologue enrichment (M+3) of
  [13C6] glucose into serine after 24 h in male pemetrexed-sensitive (n = 17) and
  male pemetrexed-resistant (n = 26), and female pemetrexed-sensitive (n = 12) and
  female pemetrexed-resistant (n = 10) NSCLC cell lines. ∗∗p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney

  (n = 17) and male pemetrexed-resistant (n = 26), and female pemetrexed-sensitive
