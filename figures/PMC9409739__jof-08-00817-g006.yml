caption: Excerpt of KEGG Level 3 metabolic pathways found in the biomarker OTUs from
  Signy Island (green) and the Syowa Station region (red). Horizontal axis indicates
  relative abundance (%) of each pathway to be compared between the two regions. The
  pathways are selected by cutoff value of mean relative abundance distance of two
  regions > |0.003|. Details of the KO functions are shown in .
