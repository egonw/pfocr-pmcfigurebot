caption: '(A) UMAP depicting pericyte (PC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) states in
  all tissues. (B) Dot plots illustrate levels (fold-change; logFC) and significance
  (−log10(FDR)) of selected DEGs in LV PC1, SMC1.2, SMC2, and MC (PC and SMC) across
  genotypes. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in SMC2 among genotypes with ≥1 enriched
  pathways. Color intensity denotes enrichment significance (−log10(FDR)). (D) UMAP
  depicting EC states in all tissues. (E) Single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ
  hybridization exemplifies BMP6 (red) expression in disease endocardium from a DSP
  (desmoplakin) compared to control RVs. Cell boundaries, WGA-stained (green); Nuclei
  DAPI-stained (blue); Bar 10μm. (F) Pairwise cell state abundance ratios in DCM LVs
  relative to controls. Proportional changes are scaled by color: increased (red)
  or decreased (blue) in disease versus control. p-values are indicated for significant
  proportional changes, FDR<0.05. (G) Dot plots illustrate LV and RV levels (fold-change;
  logFC) and significance (−log10(FDR)) of selected DEGs in EC7 across genotypes.
  Dot size and color are defined in (B).'
