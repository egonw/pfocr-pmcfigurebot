caption: Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  was performed by DAVID. Genes that differently expressed in HKDM-∆EseN mutant compared
  to HKDM infected by WT indicated by red star and are significant (p < 0.05 and q
  < 0.05). Red arrow indicates up-regulation. Blue arrow indicates downregulation.
  Numbers indicate log2 fold change in HKDM-∆EseN vs. HKDM-WT.
