caption: 'IRF-1 promoted inflammatory response and apoptosis in H/R-exposed hepatocytes
  by activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway. (a) The phosphorylation levels of p38,
  JNK, and ERK1/2 in the liver tissues of sham-operated and HIRI mice determined by
  Western blot analysis (∗p < 0.05). (b) The phosphorylation level of p38 in AML12
  cells treated with sh-IRF-1 or combined with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) determined
  by western blot analysis (∗p < 0.05). (c) The phosphorylation level of p38 in AML12
  cells treated with sh-IRF-1 or combined with SB203580 determined by immunocytochemical
  staining (∗p < 0.05). (d) The phosphorylation levels of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 in
  AML12 cells treated with sh-IRF-1 or oe-IRF-1 detected by Western blot analysis
  (∗p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC, #p < 0.05 vs. sh-NC). (e) The phosphorylation levels of p38,
  JNK, and ERK1/2 in AML12 cells treated with sh-IRF-1 or oe-IRF-1 detected by immunocytochemical
  staining (∗p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC, #p < 0.05 vs. sh-NC). (f) The mRNA expression of
  inflammatory response and apoptosis-related proteins in AML12 cells treated with
  oe-IRF-1 or combined with SB203580 determined by RT-qPCR. (g) The protein expression
  of inflammatory response and apoptosis-related proteins in AML12 cells treated with
  oe-IRF-1 or combined with SB203580 determined by Western blot analysis. (h) AML12
  cell apoptosis following treatment with oe-IRF-1 or combined with SB203580 determined
  by TUNEL staining. In (f)–(h), ∗p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC, #p < 0.05 vs. oe-IRF-1. Cell
  experiments were all repeated 3 times.'
