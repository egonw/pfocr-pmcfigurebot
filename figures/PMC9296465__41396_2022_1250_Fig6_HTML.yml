figure_title: Up- and downregulated transcripts of genes in Gammaproteobacteria, Pelagibacteraceae
  and Prochlorococcus encoding proteins of different functions in experiment M1
caption: Gammaproteobacteria (mainly SAR86 clade of Oceanospirillales), transporters
  of B12 and ammonium and cellular motility; Pelagibacteraceae, transporters of ammonium
  and amino acids, glutamate synthase, propanoate and methionine metabolism; Prochlorococcus,
  ATP synthase, photosystem I and II, cytochrome b, Magnesium chelatase, Calvin Benson
  cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, sulfate/nitrate permease, nitrate reduction. Genes
  associated to respective cellular functions were pooled and are shown in Supplementary
  Data . Dotted arrows indicate putative compounds released and exchanged among the
  three groups of organisms. Circles show no difference in the gene regulation between
  treatment and control, whereas arrows illustrate up- or downregulation (T-test,
  p < 0.25). Significant differences between treatment vs. control are highlighted
  by * (T-test, p < 0.05) and (T-test, p < 0.01). Red compares vitamin B12 treatment
  vs. control and pink compares α-ribazole vs. control.

  impact prokaryotic and protist communities in oceanic systems.
