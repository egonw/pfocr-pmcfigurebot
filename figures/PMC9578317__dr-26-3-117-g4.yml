figure_title: Synergistic inhibition of ERK pathway by TSC-22 and BRD7
caption: SKOV3 (A) and OVCAR3 (B) cancer cells were transiently transfected with expression
  vectors encoding TSC-22 and/or BRD7 for 48 h. Phosphorylated ERK, total ERK, Elk-1,
  TSC-22, and BRD7 were detected by western blot analysis. GAPDH was used as reference
  for equal protein loading. TSC-22, transforming stimulated clone 22; BRD7, bromodomain-containing
  protein 7; ERK, extracellular signal-regulate kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase.

  Protein 7 (BRD7) to Enhance the Inhibition of Extracellular Signal-Regulate Kinase
  (ERK) Pathway in Ovarian Cancer.
