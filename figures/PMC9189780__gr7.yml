caption: 'Chidamide inhibits cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of NPC. (a-b)
  HK1 and C666-1 cells were exposed to 1 µM Chidamide for 24 hours. The indicated
  proteins were analyzed by Western blotting in the indicated cells of three independent
  experiments. (c-d) Cell proliferation of HK1 and C666-1 cells when exposed to control
  or Chidamide. Representative data of three independent experiments. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD. *** p < 0.001 using Student''s t-test. (e-f) Migration and invasion
  abilities were determined using the indicated cells. Representative data of three
  independent experiments. Data are represented as the mean ± SD. *** p < 0.001 using
  Student''s t-test. (g-i) HK1 cells were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c nude
  mice to construct a lung metastasis model and treated with Chidamide or vehicle
  (n=8 per group). General views (left, scale bar: 5mm) and H&E staining of lung tissues
  of the mouse models with the indicated cells (middle, scale bar: 500μm; right, scale
  bar: 100μm). The red arrows indicate macroscopic pulmonary nodules (g). Lung weight
  (h), and quantification of macroscopic metastatic nodules (i). Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 using Student''s t-test. (j) IHC of
  the xenografted tumors shows decreased level for DNTTIP1 in the Chidamide-treated
  group. These results are repeated in three independent experiments. Scale bar: 100μm.'
