caption: Concentration-dependent sulfation, methylation, and glucuronidation of EGCG
  by human liver or small intestinal fractions. Various concentrations of EGCG were
  incubated with (A) HLC and PAPS, (B) human small intestinal cytosol and PAPS, (C)
  HLC and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), (D) human small intestinal cytosol and SAM,
  (E) human liver microsomes and uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA), and
  (F) human small intestinal microsomes and UDPGA. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. The kinetic curve at lower or higher concentrations
  is shown in Figure S4.
