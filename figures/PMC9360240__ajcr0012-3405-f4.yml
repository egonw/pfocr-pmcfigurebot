caption: SHMT2 over-expression affects multiple signaling pathways and biological
  processes in the breast cancer cells. A. Clustering results of differentially expressed
  genes comparing ZR-75-1 cells with SHMT2 over-expression with the control group
  cells. B. Volcanic map of differentially expressed mRNAs. C. GO enrichment histogram
  of differentially expressed mRNA. D. The methodology of KEGG is conducted according
  to the literature reported by Kanehisa []. KEGG pathway enrichment bars of differentially
  expressed mRNA. E. Common signaling pathways are closely associated with cell proliferation
  and survival. F. SHMT2 over-expression affects a variety of biochemical metabolic
  processes in breast cancer cells. G. SHMT2 over-expression affects the MAPK pathway,
  apoptosis pathway, and VEGF pathway.
