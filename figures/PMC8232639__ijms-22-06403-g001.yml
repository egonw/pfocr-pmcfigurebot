caption: Classic insulin signaling pathway. Insulin regulates cellular functions and
  metabolic activity by binding to the insulin receptor. Core cellular processes downstream
  of the insulin signaling system include the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways;
  details on these pathways are given in . IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IR, insulin
  receptor; PI3K, phosphoinositide3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide dependent
  protein kinase-1; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; GSK, glycogen synthase
  kinase; GS, glycogen synthase; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1;
  SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; glucose transporter 4, GLUT4;
  MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
