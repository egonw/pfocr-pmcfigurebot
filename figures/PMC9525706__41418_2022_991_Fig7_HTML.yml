figure_title: SIRT3/NIC and TRAP1 ablation hamper in vivo tumor growth
caption: 'A Kinetics of tumor growth of wild type (sgEGFP) and TRAP1 knock-out (sgTRAP1)
  sMPNST cells xenografted in nude mice. SIRT3: cells expressing pFUGW-SIRT3; GFP:
  cells expressing pFUGW-GFP. NIC: animals treated with nicotinic acid (1% in drinking
  water) for the whole duration of the experiment. Tumor volume is expressed in mm3.
  Measurement of tumor weight (mg; B), NAD+/NADH ratio (C) and NAD+ (nmol/g; D) of
  tumor samples after xenograft injection in nude mice of wild type and TRAP1 knock-out
  sMPNST cells. In C, D data are reported as mean ± SD values (n ≥ 3). In A, B data
  are reported as mean ± SEM values (n ≥ 7). A two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post-test was performed in A. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test were
  performed in B–D. ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05. E Immunohistochemical
  analysis of HIF1α expression in tumor samples from A. 40X magnification. Intensity
  of the signal was scored as it follows: score 0 = negative staining or weak/barely
  perceptible expression in <25% of cells; score 1 = weak/barely perceptible positivity
  in >25% of cells; score 2 = moderate to strong positivity in >25% of cells. F Model
  of the metabolic changes occurring in mitochondria following hyperactivation of
  the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway caused by neurofibromin ablation.'

  respiration and hampered by NAD+ and SIRT3.
