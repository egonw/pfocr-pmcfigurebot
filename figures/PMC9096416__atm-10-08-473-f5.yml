caption: 'Econazole reversed the effect of CRNDE on ATC cell proliferation (n=3).
  (A) The IC50 value of econazole, colistin, and terazosin on ATC cells for 48 h by
  MTT. (B) Econazole inhibited the proliferation of ARO and sw579 cells in a dose-dependent
  manner by MTT; (C) Econazole regulated the expression of CRNDE and inhibited the
  proliferation of ATC cells by MTT assays. *, P<0.05; #, P<0.05; (D) Econazole regulated
  the expression of CRNDE and inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ATC
  cells by western blotting. ARO, human thyroid cancer cell line; OD, optical density;
  NC, negative control; CRNDE, colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed; ATC,
  anaplastic thyroid cancer; IC50, half maximal inhibitory concentration; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5
  diphenyltetrazolium bromide.'
