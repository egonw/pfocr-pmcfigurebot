caption: Effects of FABP7 overexpression on proliferation-, invasion- and Notch pathway-associated
  proteins. (A) The expression levels of PCNA, Snail, N-cad, Twist, MMP-2 and MMP-7
  were detected by western blotting. (B) Notch pathway-related proteins were detected
  by western blotting. **P<0.01 vs. NC. FABP7, fatty acid-binding protein 7; oe, overexpression
  vector; NC, negative control; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; N-cad, N-cadherinl;
  MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
