caption: 'Irisin reversed AGE-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in ASCs via a SIRT3-dependent
  pathway. (a) Δψm was assessed by using CLSM. Red fluorescence was emitted by JC-1
  aggregates in healthy mitochondria with polarized inner mitochondrial membranes,
  whereas green fluorescence was emitted by cytosolic JC-1 monomers, indicating Δψm
  depolarization. Merged images indicate the colocalization of JC-1 aggregates and
  monomers. (b) Δψm of each group was calculated as the ratio of red to green fluorescence.
  (c) The intracellular ROS levels were estimated using DCF (green), and the fluorescence
  values were read at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of
  525 nm. (d) The bar charts show the quantification of intracellular ROS levels expressed
  as the fold change relative to the control group. (e) The mitochondrial O2·− levels
  were estimated using MitoSOX Red (red), and mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker
  Green Dye (green). (f–h) ATP content (f). The activity levels of mitochondrial electron
  transport chain complex I (g) and complex IV (h) were determined using corresponding
  assay kits according to the manufacturer''s instructions. All results are representative
  of three independent experiments, and values are presented as mean ± SEM. Scale bar
  = 20 μm. Δψm: mitochondrial membrane potential; CLSM: confocal laser scanning microscopy;
  Lv-Control: control lentivirus; Lv-shSIRT3: lentivirus-mediated SIRT3 knockdown.
