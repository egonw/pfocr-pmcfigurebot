caption: ANTXR1 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by promoting β-catenin
  into the nucleus. (a) The expression of β-catenin in K562 cells after overexpression
  or knockdown of ANTXR1 was detected by immunofluorescence with a confocal laser
  scanning microscope. The color “red” represents β-catenin, and “blue” represents
  nuclei stained by DAPI. The merged images indicate the localization of β-catenin
  in both the nuclei and cytoplasm. (b, c) The TOP-/FOP-flash luciferase assay shows
  the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in 293T cells overexpressing
  or knocking down the ANTXR1 gene. Experiments n = 3. The error bar represents the
  SD.∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01. NC designates the negative control.
