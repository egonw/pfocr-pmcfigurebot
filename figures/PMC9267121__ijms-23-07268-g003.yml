caption: Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) regulated the gene expression profiles in the TNFα-treated
  human chondrocytes after 48 h. (A) Differently expressed genes (DEGs) in human chondrocytes
  between the normal group and TNFα group (819 DEGs), and TNFα group and TNFα + 10
  μM DHC group (358 DEGs), were analyzed through Volcano plot. (B) Common DEGs of
  the 819 and 358 DEGs detected through Venn diagram analysis. (C) Gene ontology (GO)
  analysis of the common DEGs. (D) Fold change (FC) expression of inflammatory factors.
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed in (E) gradient and
  (F) circular diagram.
