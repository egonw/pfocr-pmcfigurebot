caption: Effect of IQ on AAPH-induced protein expression of MC3T3 cells. (a) Protein
  expression levels of the CON group, AAPH group, and IQ-AAPH group on the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE
  signaling pathway; (b) the protein expression levels of three groups on the Caspase3
  signaling pathway. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data are expressed
  as the mean Â± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
