caption: Identification of RAS/RAF/ERK signaling pathway related to the toxicity of
  α-amanitin (α-AMA) in Huh-7 cells. (A) Cell viability assay for α-AMA treatment
  with ERK1/2 inhibitor. Cell density was 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The
  viability of Huh-7 cells was detected by CCK-8 reagent after α-AMA and ERK1/2 inhibitor
  treatment for 24 h. The data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 3). (B) Immunoblotting
  assay of RAS/RAF/ERK cascade after α-AMA and ERK1/2 inhibitor (FR180204) treatment
  of Huh-7 cells.
