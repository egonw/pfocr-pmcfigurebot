  fecal microbiomes
caption: '(a) Significant enrichment of taxa (q<0.1; GSEA) along the first principal
  component (PC1) of MAG abundance or transcript abundance. Abbreviation: NES; Normalized
  enrichment score. (b) Carbohydrate utilization pathways significantly enriched (q<0.1;
  GSEA) by treatment group (β1, circles) or the interaction of treatment group and
  study week (β3, squares). Right subpanel: Each point represents a MAG transcript
  assigned to each of the indicated functional pathways (rows), ranked by the direction
  and statistical significance of their differential expression in MDCF-2 versus RUSF
  treated participants (defined as the direction of the fold-change × −log10(P-value)).
  Transcripts are colored by their MAGs of origin. Larger, black outlined circles
  indicate leading edge transcripts assigned to the pathway described at the left
  of the panel. (c) Carbohydrate utilization pathways significantly enriched (q<0.1;
  GSEA) in upper vs lower WLZ quartile responders (β1, diamonds), or the interaction
  of WLZ response quartile and study week (β3, triangles) (see linear mixed effects
  model). Right subpanel: Transcripts assigned to each functional pathway. The coloring
  and outlining of circles have identical meaning as in panel b. The enrichment of
  glucuronate and galacturonate pathways was driven by the same transcripts; hence,
  these pathways were considered as a single unit. See – for .'
