caption: (A, B) The 5 most positive and negative genes related to NUP205 in LGG. The
  results of GSEA analysis suggested that NUP205 participated in the pathological
  process of LGG via (C) cell cycle, (D) notch signaling pathway, (E) aminoacyl-tRNA
  biosynthesis. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
article_title: Exploring the relationship between abnormally high expression of NUP205
  and the clinicopathological characteristics, immune microenvironment, and prognostic
  value of lower-grade glioma.
