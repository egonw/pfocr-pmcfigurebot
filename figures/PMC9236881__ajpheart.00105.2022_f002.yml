caption: 'Distinct changes in the cardiac metabolome during pregnancy and postpartum
  period. Unsupervised and supervised metabolomics analyses from hearts extracted
  from nonpregnant, diestrus (NP), midpregnant (MP; day 8 of pregnancy), late pregnant
  (LP; day 16 of pregnancy), and 1 wk postbirth (PB) female mice (n = 7â€“8 per group).
  A: unsupervised analysis was performed and a heatmap generated showing the top 75
  most changed metabolites in hearts from NP, MP, LP, and PB female mice. Red indicates
  increased abundance, and blue indicates reduced abundance. Intensity of color indicates
  increased significance. B: supervised analysis showing partial least squares discriminant
  analysis (PLS-DA) highlighting group separation. C: the variable importance in projection
  plot (VIP) of the top 25 metabolites contributing to the group separation observed
  in the PLS-DA plot. D: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway impact
  analysis of the significantly changed cardiac metabolites between NP, MP, LP, and
  PB female mice. E: KEGG metabolite analysis of changed pathways during pregnancy
  and postpartum period. F and G: pathway analysis of urea cycle metabolites during
  LP (F) and PB (G). Red indicates significantly increased metabolite abundance, blue
  indicates reduced metabolite abundance, and gray indicates no change. The size of
  the circles indicates the degree of significance and importance of the increase
  in abundance (e.g., larger refers to greater significance and importance).'
