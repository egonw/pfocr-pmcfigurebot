caption: 'GAS inhibits hypoxia-induced ferroptosis in HT22 Cells. (A), Western blot
  showing the levels of GPx4 and COX2 at different time points of hypoxia in HT22
  cells (B), HT22 cells were pretreated with GAS for 1 h and cultured in hypoxia for
  36 h, and then, the expressions of GPx4 and COX2 were detected by Western blotting
  (C), ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry (D), detection of GSH content by
  ELISA (E), When HT22 cells were cultured under hypoxia for 36 h in the presence
  or absence of GAS, the intracellular Fe2+ levels were measured by immunofluorescence
  microscopy using FerroOrange. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus control, # p < 0.05,
  ## p < 0.01 versus hypoxia.'
