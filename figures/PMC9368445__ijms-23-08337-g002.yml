caption: 'The effect of simvastatin on the activation of signaling pathway upon B.
  abortus infection at 15 and 25 min pi. Cells were pre-treated with 20 µg/mL of simvastatin.
  At 15 min pi, lipid raft isolation was performed, and the distribution of TLR4 in
  lipid raft was analyzed using immunoblotting assay (A). The lipid raft fractions
  are indicated by an asterisk in fraction 2, WB: Western blot. ImageJ software was
  used to calculate the relative intensity of TLR4 in lipid raft compared to total
  cellular TLR4 (B). The downstream signaling pathway of TLR4, including MAPKs (ERK1/2,
  p38α, and JNK) and JAK2 was also analyzed by immunoblotting assay at 15 and 25 min
  pi (C), and the relative intensity of these proteins normalized to the control β-actin
  was carried out by ImageJ software (D–G). The data are represented as the mean ±
  SD of duplicate samples from at least two independent experiments. Statistically
  significant differences relative to control group are indicated by an asterisk (*
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).'
