caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the potential mechanism of orcinol glucoside
  (OG)'s effects in a mouse model of senile osteoporosis. OG inhibited osteoclastogenesis
  by scavenging ROS, subsequently elevating the expression of antioxidant enzymes
  via activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway and inhibiting autophagy by activating the
  mTOR pathway. Thus, OG is a promising candidate drug for the treatment of bone disorders
  related with aging and oxidative stress, especially senile osteoporosis in the future.
