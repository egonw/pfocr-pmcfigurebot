caption: Wound healing assay, invasion assay and WB assay to verify the regulation
  of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway on the involvement of SECTM1 in the EMT process.
  (A) Representative images of cellular wound healing assay in U251 cells (U251-NC,
  U251-sh1, U251-sh2) after 24h of treatment or no treatment with TGF-β1 agonist SRI-011381.
  (B) Relative migration area of wound healing assay. (C) Representative images of
  cell invasion after 24h of TGF-β1 agonist SRI-011381 treatment or no treatment of
  U87 MG cells (U87 MG-NC, U87 MG-sh1, U87 MG-sh2). (D) The number of invaded cells
  counted. (E) WB experimental images of TGFβ pathway and EMT-related markers after
  24h of TGF-β1 agonist SRI-011381 treatment or no treatment of U87 MG cells (U87
  MG-NC, U87 MG-sh1, U87 MG-sh2). (F) Statistical analysis of the gray-scale quantitative
  values of WB experiments in the E-figure. (G) WB experimental images of TGFβ pathway
  and EMT-related markers in U251 cells (U251-NC, U251-sh1, U251-sh2) after 24h of
  TGF-β1 agonist SRI-011381 treatment or no treatment. (H) Statistical analysis plot
  of the gray-scale quantitative values of WB experiments in G Fig. All data were
  analyzed by t-test and shown as mean ± SD (three independent experiments), *P <
  0.05; ** P <0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001.
