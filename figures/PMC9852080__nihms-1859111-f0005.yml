caption: Global gene expression profiling reveals upregulation of cold-inducible RNA
  binding proteins RBM3 and CIRP in CKD mouse ventricles. (A) Gene expression profile
  in whole ventricles of CKD (n=8) mice compared with controls (n=8); blue dots represent
  Rbm3 and Cirp; red dots represent genes linked to cellular response to hypoxia in
  previous studies. (B) Pathway diagram including select hypoxia inducible factor
  (HIF)-related transcripts; red text highlights transcripts that are differentially
  expressed in CKD mice. (C) RT-qPCR comparison of expression levels of Rbm3 and Cirp
  transcripts in control versus CKD ventricles exposed to high (0 25%) and low-dose
  (0 15%) regimens (n=8 control and 8 CKD mice for high-dose experiment; n=10 control
  and 10 CKD mice for low-dose experiment). (D) Quantification of Western blot analysis
  comparing expression levels of CIRP in control (n=8) versus CKD ventricles (n=8)
  exposed to the low-dose regimen. Box-and-whisker plots show the median, first and
  third quartiles, minimum, and maximum values; *P<0.05; **P<10−2; ***P<10−3; ****P<10−4
  for CKD versus control using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric comparison
  of unpaired samples.
