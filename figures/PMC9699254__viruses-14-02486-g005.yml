caption: Enteroviruses inhibit Ire1-mediated Xbp1 mRNA splicing at the middle, but
  not early stage of infection. (A) HeLa cells were infected with PV or CVB3, then
  at 3 hpi 10 mM DTT was added to the medium. 2 h later, total RNA was isolated and
  the relative levels of the spliced Xbp1 mRNA were measured by RT-qPCR, as described
  earlier, ** p < 0.01. (B) Relative Xbp1s mRNA level in PV-infected HeLa cells with
  and without the addition of 10 mM DTT at 0 hpi, as revealed by RT-qPCR. (C) The
  same experiment as in (B), with CVB3. Each experiment was performed in duplicate
  and repeated at least three times. (D) DTT-induced Xbp1 mRNA splicing in PV-infected
  cells analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products. HeLa cells were
  infected with PV and treated with 10 mM DTT at the indicated time points. 2 h later,
  cells were harvested, RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR with an Xbp1-specific primer
  pair producing fragments of either 442 or 416 bp (corresponding to the unspliced
  or spliced Xbp1 mRNAs, respectively) was performed. Note that the amounts of the
  two PCR products should not be compared to each other, as they have different lengths.
