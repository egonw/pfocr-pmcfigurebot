caption: 'Pathologic and genomic correlates of response. (A) Oncoprint showing the
  genomic landscape of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of foregut origin
  treated with ribociclib and everolimus in this study, as identified through next-generation
  sequencing by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actional
  Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT). (B and C). Alteration status in (B) cell cycle regulators
  and (C) mTOR pathway genes in relation to disease stabilization during treatment
  with ribociclib and everolimus. In correlative analyses, there was no association
  between genetic alterations in the tumor of patients experiencing disease stabilization
  versus progressive disease during treatment with this drug combination.Sequencing
  data from two pre-treatment tumor samples were available in 2 patients. Sequencing
  data from pre- and post-treatment tumor samples were available in one patient (notated
  with *).Abbreviations: SD, stable disease. PD, progressive disease.'
