caption: Selected nAChR-mediated proliferative and apoptosis signaling pathways. (A)
  Binding of ACh or nicotine to nAChRs induces the formation of the oligomeric complex,
  which consists of nAChR, β-arrestin, and Src; this complex activates Src. Activated
  Src triggers the MAP kinase pathway and induces the formation of the cyclin D1-Cdk4/6
  complex, leading to the phosphorylation of Rb [,,]. The hyperphosphorylation of
  Rb releases the transcription factor E2F1 on proliferation-related gene promotors,
  leading to S-phase entry. The MAP kinase pathway also induces binding between the
  Rb-E2F1 dimer and Raf-1. The sustained mitogenic signaling leads to the dissociation
  of Raf-1 and Rb, leaving free E2F1. The increased influx of Ca2+ by nAChRs causes
  ERK1/2 and MEKK1 activation, MEKK1 activates NF-κB, and cell proliferation is induced
  [,,,,,]. (B) nAChR causes phosphorylation of Bad and Bax, thereby inactivating them
  and preventing apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and its activation by nAChRs induces
  cell survival. The PKC, Akt, PKA, and MAP kinase pathways mediate this signaling.
