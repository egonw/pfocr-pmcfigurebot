caption: MTHFD2 inhibited apoptotic activity, maintained MMP, and promoted cell cycle
  of BC cells (A) Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry for T24 and 5637 cells;
  (B) JC‐1 was observed as green monomers or as red aggregates. The micrographs were
  recorded under a fluorescent inverted microscope (OLYMPUS IX71) (scale bar represents
  50 μm), and the red JC‐1 fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ. (C, D)
  Protein expression levels of Bcl‐2, Bax, and cyclin D1. (E) Cell cycle analysis
  was measured by flow cytometry for T24 and 5637 cells. (ns vs. Control p ≥ 0.05;
  ** vs. shNC p < 0.01).
