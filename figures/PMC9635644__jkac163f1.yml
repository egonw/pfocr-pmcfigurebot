caption: Enteric P.e. infection induces alterations in whole-body gene expression
  including upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes. a) Schematic outline of our
  experimental approach. b) Volcano plot showing the gene expression changes following
  enteric infection. Genes were considered differentially expressed if they showed
  a significant [q-val (FDR corrected P-val) <0.05] change in expression that was
  >1.5-fold up- or downregulated in infected vs mock-infected flies. Dashed line indicates
  q-val = 0.05. c) Heatmap depicting the change in expression (Log2-fold change vs
  mock-infected flies) of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and other immune-response
  genes following enteric infection.
