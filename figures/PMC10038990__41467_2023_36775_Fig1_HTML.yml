figure_title: The rhythmic lipid metabolism was disordered with aging
caption: 'A Liver TG levels of C57BL/6 J mice at 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months
  (2 months: n = 6; 6 months: n = 5; 12 months: n = 5 biologically independent animals);
  B H&E and Oil Red O staining of liver tissues of C57BL/6 J mice at 2 months, 6 months,
  and 12 months; C β-Gal staining of liver tissues of C57BL/6 J mice at 2 months,
  6 months, 12 months, and 21 months; D–F Heatmap represents rhythmic genes exclusively
  in the livers of C57BL/6 J mice at 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months by using high-throughput
  RNA sequencing. The colors from blue to yellow indicate low to high gene expression
  levels, respectively; G Venn diagram displays the total number of rhythmic genes
  (left) and number of rhythmic non-metabolic or metabolic genes (right) in the liver;
  the black dots mean genes only in the indicated groups; a black line connecting
  black dots indicates that genes are in the connected group at the same time; H–J
  Pie charts indicate selected Top 20 biological process by using gene ontology (GO)
  analysis of genes circadian in 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months groups. The yellow
  of the outer circle means a lipid-related pathway, blue of the outer circle means
  a non-lipid-related pathway. Data were represented as mean ± SEM. Exact p values
  are depicted in the figure. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA
  for A. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.'
