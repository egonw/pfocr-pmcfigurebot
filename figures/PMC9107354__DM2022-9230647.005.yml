caption: TGF-β1 activator reverse I-125 seed irradiation inhibitory effects on the
  EMT and TGF-β1 signaling pathway. TGF-β1 activator reverses the inhibitory role
  in migration (a) and invasion (b) of PLC and Huh7. TGF-β1 activator reverses the
  roles in the EMT and TGF-β1 signaling pathway-related markers by WB assay (c) and
  immunofluorescence assay for PLC (d) and for Huh7 (e) and their relative IOD (integrated
  optical density) per cell were plotted, respectively (f). The average number of
  invasive cells was calculated by counting then number of cells in 5 fields per chamber.
  Data was expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). The difference was of statistical significance
  (P < 0.05).
