caption: 'Low expression of DDX3 promoted CRC cell proliferation in vitro. (A) Protein
  expression of DDX3 in CRC cell lines by western blot (upper panel). Gray analysis
  of DDX3 protein expression is shown in lower panel. (B) Cell colony of six CRC cells
  (upper panel). The numbers of clones are analyzed in the lower left panel. Negative
  correlation between DDX3 expression and number of clones (lower right panel). (C)
  Growth curves of six CRC cells (upper panel). Negative correlation between DDX3
  expression and absorbance of cells at 96th hour (lower panel). (D) DDX3 knockdown
  in SW480 and HCT116 cells and overexpression in DLD-1 cells (upper panel). Gray
  analysis of DDX3 protein expression is shown in lower panel. (E) Growth curves of
  DDX3-KD SW480 (left panel) and HCT116 cells (middle panel) and growth curves of
  DDX3-OE DLD-1 cells (right panel) by CCK-8 assay. (F) Cell colony of DDX3-KD SW480
  and HCT116 cells and cell colony of DDX3-OE DLD-1 cells by colony formation assay
  (left panel). The numbers of clones are analyzed in the right panel. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001 via Student''s t-test. All graphs are drawn from the mean ± SD of three
  independent replicates. Abbreviation: CRC, colorectal cancer; EV, empty vector;
  KD, knockdown; NC, negative control; OE, overexpression.'
