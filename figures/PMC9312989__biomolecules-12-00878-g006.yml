caption: RTK, RAS, and PI3K signaling in colorectal cancer showing the genetic pathways
  and frequencies of mutations in 13 studies and 4535 samples in cBioportal platform
  that led to deregulation in this pathway reaching the cell phenotypic modification.
  The percentage under each gene represents the percent of mutated/altered samples
  relative to profiled ones in those studies [,,,,,,,,].
