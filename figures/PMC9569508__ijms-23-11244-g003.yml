caption: Drosophila target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, a simplified schematic
  representation. The inactive and active states of the pathway are shown on the left
  and right, respectively. The anabolic kinase TOR functions in two distinct complexes,
  TORC1 and TORC2, and regulates cap-dependent translation as well as chromatin architecture
  and gene regulation. Through a number of intermediate steps, nutrients, particularly
  amino acids, and growth factors, such as insulin-like peptides, activate TORC1 (for
  additional details, see ). Akt, protein kinase B (PKB); Alc, Alicorn; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; Chrb, Charybde; Fkbp12, FK506-binding protein 12kD; GATOR, GAP activity
  towards the Rags; Gig, Gigas; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; Iml1, Increased minichromosome
  loss 1; Lkb1, Lkb1 kinase; Mts, Microtubule star; Nclb, No child left behind; Nprl2,
  Nitrogen permease regulator-like 2; Nprl3, Nitrogen permease regulator-like 3; Pp2A-29B,
  Protein phosphatase 2A at 29B; RagA-B, Ras-related GTP binding A/B; RagC-D, Ras-related
  GTP binding C/D; REPTOR, Repressed by TOR; REPTOR-BP, REPTOR-binding partner; Rheb,
  Ras homolog enriched in brain; Rictor, Rapamycin-insensitive companion of Tor; Scyl,
  Scylla; Sesn, a stress-inducible protein Sestrin; Sin1, SAPK-interacting protein
  1; Slif, Slimfast; SNF4Aγ, SNF4/AMP-activated protein kinase gamma subunit; Tor,
  Target of rapamycin; V-ATPase, vacuolar-type ATPase; Wdb, Widerborst; 14-3-3, chaperone
  proteins. For the other proteins shown in the scheme, the symbols and the full names
  are identical. Arrows and bar-headed lines indicate activation and inhibition, respectively.
  Dotted arrows indicate that the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Phosphate
  groups are depicted as solid black dots. Protein complexes are encircled by dashed
  lines. Inactive components of the pathway are shown in semi-transparent mode. It
  should be noted that the indicated transcription factors might not always be required
  together for the activity of the target genes. Effects of mutations, depletion or
  overexpression of protein molecules on adult fly lifespan are color-coded according
  to the legend at the bottom; different simultaneous effects are shown as color gradients
  (for the references, see ).
