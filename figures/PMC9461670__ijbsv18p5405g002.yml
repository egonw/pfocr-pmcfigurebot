caption: Effect and mechanism of IL-6 on organ fibrosis. Chronic inflammation is caused
  by injury (pathogens, toxins, mechanical injury), and monocytes, macrophages, B
  cells and fibroblasts release IL-6 at the wound site. IL-6 promotes the transformation
  of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.
