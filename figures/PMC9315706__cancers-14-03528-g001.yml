caption: Stress-Induced Autophagy Pathway and Machinery. Tumor microenvironmental
  stress stimulates autophagy via AMPK activation which induces autophagic initiation.
  The ULK1 complex and PI3KC3-C1 facilitate phagophore formation which matures and
  elongates into an autophagosome by structural proteins LC3-II and the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16
  complex. The autophagosome forms around the target protein/organelle and fuses with
  a lysosome mediated by the PI3KC3-C2. The cargo is degraded into various biomolecules
  and released into the cytoplasm. Black arrows indicate binding to or moving to,
  green arrows indicate activation, green dashed arrows indicate attraction, red arrows
  indicate inhibition. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 24 February 2022).
