caption: 'Molecular pathways of EPA-induced apoptosis in cancer models. (A) EPA can
  trigger intrinsic pathway activation through arresting the progression of the cell
  cycle, (1) upregulation of Raf/MAPK pathway, sustained activation of EGFR/p38 MAPK
  axis, (2) accumulation of cholesterol by inhibition of SREBP2 and ABCA1, (3) downregulation
  of survival pathways (ERK1/2/Akt/mTOR/NFkB), (4) generation of ROS, (5) intracellular
  Ca2+ accumulation, and (6) Bcl-2 suppression through the p53/miR-34a axis, wt-p53
  accumulation, activation of ACS. (7) These signals promote mitochondrial depolarization,
  and cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo release to the cytosol, activation of caspases
  -9, -3, -7, cleavage PARP, and DNA fragmentation. (8) Also, EPA causes upregulation
  of Bax, Bak and ADORA1. (9) In contrast, EPA promote downregulation of Bcl-xL, Survivin
  and XIAP. (B) Regarding the extrinsic pathway, (10) EPA increased FAS surface expression,
  downregulate FLIP levels, and promote activation of caspase-8. (C) (11) Numerous
  studies demonstrate crosstalk between both pathways through caspase-8 cleaved that
  generates tBid, which can be oligomerized with Bax and that triggers MOMP. Moreover,
  (12) treatment with C20E through TNFR1 activate ASK1-MKK4/7-JNK/p38MAPK pathway,
  promoting the tBid. EPA: Eicosapentanoic acid. Raf: Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma.
