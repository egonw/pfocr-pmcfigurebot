caption: 'miR‐99a‐5p negatively regulates TLR8 in the occurrence of impingement cartilage
  injury of rabbit knee joint. (A) Different vectors were injected into the auricular
  vein of the cartilage‐damaged rabbits. (B) Specific grouping and intervention measures
  of animal experimental model. (C−F) The expression of toll‐like receptor signaling
  pathway related genes MyD88 (C), IRF7 (D), NF‐κB (E), and IκBα (F). (G−J) Detection
  of cytokines related to cell inflammatory apoptosis: IL‐6 (G), TNF (H), caspase‐9
  (I), and BCL2 (J). (K) The protein expression levels of MyD88, IRF7, NF‐κB, Iκ‐Bα,
  IL‐6 (G), TNF, caspase‐9, and BCL2 in different groups by western blot analysis
  test. (L) Schematic diagram of mechanism signal illustration that mir‐99a‐5p negatively
  regulates the expression of TLR8 to affect the occurrence of chondrocyte innate
  immune response (*p < .05). CON, control group; KO, knockout; OV‐EX, overexpression;
  TLR, toll‐like receptors.'
