caption: Axonal BDNF promotes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in a PLC-γ-dependent
  manner in rat cortical neurons. (A) Evaluation of Ca2+signaling induced by BDNF.
  The change in fluorescence intensity associated with Fluo4-AM (2 μM) was used to
  measure the concentration change in cytosolic Ca2+. Representative images of compartmentalized
  cultures loaded with Fluo4-AM in the AC treated with vehicle or BDNF (50 ng/ml)
  in the AC with or without U73122 (5 μM) pretreatment. Live-cell imaging of each
  axonal field in the AC recorded before BDNF treatment (0 s) and during 60 s of BDNF
  treatment. Scale bar, 10 μm. (B) Mean Fluo4-AM fluorescence intensity (±SEM) for
  each treatment at different snapshot times. Fab represents the average fluorescence
  of the baseline. We calculate the average of the calcium recordings for the vehicle
  or U17322 treatments, and subsequently standardize the data of the baseline, BDNF
  and BDNF + U17622 calcium recordings by these respective values. n = 8–12 axons
  from three independent compartmentalized cultures. Statistical analysis was performed
  by two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
  **p < 0.01. (C) Quantification of the velocity of Ca2+ back-propagation of the fluorescence
  signal associated with Fluo4-AM under BDNF conditions.
