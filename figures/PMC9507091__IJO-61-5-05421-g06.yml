caption: Effect of EA on the ROS/ERK signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells. (A-D) Western blot analysis of the protein expression levels of p-ERK and
  LC3 II/I at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells treated with or without a ROS inhibitor.
  β-actin was used as a control. (E-H) Western blot analysis of the protein expression
  levels of p-ERK and LC3 II/I at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells treated with or
  without the ERK inhibitor PD98059. β-actin was used as a control. All data are shown
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05. EA, eupalinolide A; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Eupalinolide A induces autophagy via the ROS/ERK signaling pathway
  in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.
