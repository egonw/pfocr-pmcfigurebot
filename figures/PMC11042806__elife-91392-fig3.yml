figure_title: In vitro analysis of wild-type (WT) vs. Ikzf1-cko regulatory T cells
  (Treg)
caption: (a) Secretion of IL-2 and IFNg protein by WT and Ikzf1-cko Treg measured
  by ELISA (n=3). (b) IL-2, IFNg, and TNFa production by Treg from WT mice vs. mice
  with a dominant-negative form of Ikaros (IkDN) measured by ELISA (n=3). (c) IL-2-induced
  phosphorylation of STAT5 in WT and Ikzf1-cko Treg measured by flow cytometry in
  vitro. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and individual histograms (inset, n=3)
  are depicted. (d) Activation-induced proliferation of WT (closed) and Ikzf1-cko
  (open) Treg measured by dye dilution (n=3). (e) Gene ontology analysis of genes
  down-regulated (top panel) and up-regulated (bottom panel) in Ikzf1-cko compared
  to WT Treg. The x-axis is fold enrichment and numbers to the right are unique genes
  in each pathway. (f) Differential expression of core Treg, nTreg, aTreg, cTreg,
  and eTreg genes () in ex vivo (left panel) and in vitro stimulated (right panel)
  WT and Ikzf1-cko Treg. The heatmap represents z-score and genes significantly differentially
  expressed are shown in red.
