caption: Primary active components of Vernonia anthelmintica (L.) Willd. and the prediction
  of biological targets involved in the treatment of vitiligo. (A) Network of interactions
  between active ingredients, action targets, and vitiligo. The circle represents
  the potential action targets of active ingredients; the rhombus represents the active
  ingredients of V. anthelmintica (L.) Willd.; and the triangle represents vitiligo.
  (B) Identification of 43 overlapping differentially expressed genes associated with
  the targets of vitiligo (blue) and the pharmaceutical components of V. anthelmintica
  (L.) Willd. (yellow). (C) Proteinâ€“protein interaction network diagram of V. anthelmintica
  (L.) Willd. intervention disease targets; the thicker the connected edges, the greater
  the interaction between the two nodes. (D) Top 10 genes associated with V. anthelmintica
  (L.). Willd. in the treatment of vitiligo; deeper shades of red indicate higher
  degree values. (E) GO enrichment analysis of the vitiligo-related disease targets
  associated with the primary active components of Vernonia anthelmintica (L.) Willd.
  (F) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the vitiligo-related disease targets associate
  with the primary active components of V. anthelmintica (L.) Willd.
