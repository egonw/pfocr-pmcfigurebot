caption: 'Identification of prognosis‐related biomarkers in plasma exosomes of HCC
  patients. A) Volcano plot showing differential LncRNAs in plasma exosomes of HCC
  patients versus healthy control samples (TCGA cohort). B) Volcano plot showing prognosis‐related
  LncRNAs in HCC tissue versus healthy control tissues (ES cohort). C) Venn diagram
  demonstrating the 108 differential LncRNAs. Out of 108 LncRNAs, 12 have been validated
  in the EVLncRNAs2.0 database as being associated with HCC. D) LncRNAs–protein pathway
  function network. E) Expression level of 12 LncRNAs in plasma exosomes of HCC patients
  with different TNM stage (ES cohort), presented as mean ± SD, with significance
  assessed using a t‐test. F) Sensitivity and linear range of LUCAT‐1 detecting in
  Huh7 exosomes enriched by functionalized SiO2‐chip (n = 3 independent technical
  replicates). R2, coefficient of determination. G) Sensitivity and linear range of
  EGFR‐AS‐1 detecting in Huh7 exosomes enriched by functionalized SiO2‐chip (n = 3
  independent technical replicates). R2, coefficient of determination. H) Melting
  curves of LUCAT‐1 detecting in Huh7 exosomes enriched by 3D functionalized SiO2‐chip.
  I) Melting curves of EGFR‐AS‐1 detecting in Huh7 exosomes enriched by functionalized
  SiO2‐chip. Abbreviations: TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and ES cohort (exosome
  sequencing cohorts).'
