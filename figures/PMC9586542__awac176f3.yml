caption: Serum lipid profiles discriminate Parkinson’s disease patients from controls
  in the LRRK2 Ashkenazi Jewish cohort. To determine if lipid profiles could distinguish
  between groups in a second cohort, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on identified
  principal components was performed. It was revealed that the three canonical functions
  generated significantly discriminated the groups. (A) A scatterplot of the first
  two functions clearly showed separation between the control and Parkinson’s disease
  groups, and between the LRRK2 mutation and non-mutation Parkinson’s disease groups.
  (B) A scatterplot of the first and third functions shows separation between Parkinson’s
  disease groups. To determine lipids that may contribute to the discrimination of
  Parkinson’s disease patients from controls independent of LRRK2 G2019S mutation,
  controls (including LRRK2 carriers without Parkinson’s disease) were compared to
  a Parkinson’s disease group (LRRK2 and non-LRRK2 Parkinson’s disease). (C–F) Multivariate
  ANOVA covarying for age and sex identified four principal components, (C) PC23,
  (D) PC32, (E) PC50 and (F) PC72, which remained significantly different between
  the two groups. (G–J) The top 20 lipid species that contributed to the top four
  principal components that significantly distinguished between controls and Parkinson’s
  disease. The dashed red line represents the expected value if the contribution of
  lipids were uniform. n = 315.
