caption: 'A, B Aggregate profile (upper panel) and heatmap (lower panel) of the genome-wide
  H2Bub1 and H3K79me3 occupancy levels at the gene body regions of siControl- and
  siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells at 48 h post-transfection. C Differential binding
  analysis (DiffBind) of the genome-wide H3K79me3 occupancy changes occurring in RNF40-silenced
  compared to the siControl-treated HCC1806 cells (in blue: basal peak concentration≥3,
  log2FC ≥ I1I, p-val < 0.05). D, E Aggregate profile of the basal occupancy levels
  of H2Bub1 (upper profile) and H3K79me3 (lower profile) at the gene body regions)
  as well as the basal gene expression levels of downregulated (down), upregulated
  (up) and unregulated (unreg) genes upon RNF40 silencing. F Aggregate profile of
  the basal occupancy levels of H3K27ac at the TSSs of downregulated (down), upregulated
  (up) and unregulated (unreg) genes upon RNF40 silencing. G Aggregate profile (upper
  panel) and heatmap (lower panel) of the genome-wide H3K27ac occupancy levels at
  the TSSs of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells at 48 h post-transfection.
  H Venn diagram of 97 downregulated genes (down: log2FC ≤ −0.7, p-val < 0.05, basemean≥15)
  with a concomitant loss of TSS-associated H3K27ac occupancy (regions with H3K27ac
  loss: FC ≤ 0.87, basal H3K27ac peak concentration≥2) upon RNF40 silencing (left
  panel) and which strongly enrich for several TEAD4 binding hits (right panel), based
  on the ENCODE TF ChIP-seq 2015 database (retrieved from Enrichr: https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/).
  I Screenshots of the TSS-associated H3K27ac occupancy at YAP1-target genes (TK1,
  AXL, ANKRD1, PDLIM2) in siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells (left panel)
  and chromatin immunoprecipitation and RT-qPCR (ChIP-RTqPCR, right panel) at selected
  TSS-proximal H3K27ac-occupied genomic regions, represented as dashed lines in the
  left panel. J Violin plot of the TSS-proximal H3K27ac occupancy at YAP1-target genes,
  enriched by the ENCODE TF ChIP-seq 2015 (see Fig. 5H), in siControl- and siRNF40-treated
  HCC1806 cells. K Western blot analysis of phospho-YAP1 (S127), total YAP1 and actin
  in siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells. L TEAD-driven luciferase reporter
  assay of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells, without and with LATSi. M
  Graphical summary of the RNF40-dependent activation of the YAP1-driven transcriptomic
  program in HCC1806 cells (Created with BioRender.com). CSC: Cancer Stem Cell. Statistical
  test: One-way Anova (E, L), Mann–Whitney test (J), Student t-test (I). *p-val < 0.05,
  ***p-val < 0.005. Error bars: Standard error of the mean (SEM). D, E, F, H: downregulated
  genes with log2FC ≤ −0.7, p-val<0.05, basemean≥15, upregulated genes with log2FC ≥ 0.7,
  p-val < 0.05, basemean≥15, unregulated genes with log2FC ≤ I0.25I, p-val > 0.9,
  basemean≥15. ChIP-sequencing of H3K79me3 was performed in biological duplicates
  (n = 2) and of H2Bub1 and H3K27ac in one replicate (n = 1) per condition. For the
  rest of the experiments, they were performed in biological triplicates (n = 3) per
  condition. RPGC: reads per genome coverage.'
