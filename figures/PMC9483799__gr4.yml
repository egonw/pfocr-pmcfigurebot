caption: 'On-target inhibition of HASPIN and mTOR synergistically trigger enhanced
  DNA damage and apoptosis in KRAS-mutant cells.(A) The indicated cell lines were
  exposed to the drugs singly or in combination for 72 h. Representative western blots
  showing protein levels of γ-H2AX for DNA damage and cPARP for apoptosis induction. (B)
  Flow cytometry analysis using AnnexinV-FITC and 7AAD-PI was performed after the
  cells were incubated with CHR-6494, CCI-779, and their combination for 48 h. Representative
  image of apoptosis induction responding to the treatments determined by flow cytometry
  analysis (left) and percentage of apoptotic cells (right). (C) Detection of γ-H2AX
  foci in SW480 cells by immunofluorescence after 72-h treatment with indicated drugs.
  Representative foci-containing cells at oil 100x objective magnification are shown
  (left). Mean number of γ-H2AX-focus per SW480 nuclei (right). Over 120 nuclei were
  analyzed over three experiments. Scale bar: 10μm. (D) Expression levels of proteins
  involved in the DNA damage response pathway of whole protein extract in SW480 cells
  by western blot analysis after 72-h treatment with indicated drugs. (E) A549 and
  HCT116 cells were treated with either 600nM CHR-6494, 3μM CCI-779, or both for 72 h,
  and cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Left panel: representative
  images; right panel: statistical analysis of the left panel. Values represent mean
  ± SD (n = 3), ns: not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.'
