caption: Effect of ERK inhibitor PD98059 on antioxidant-related protein expressions
  in IPEC-J2 cells. The IPEC-J2 cells were treated with DHM (20 μmol/mL) and PD98059
  (10 μmol/mL) for 36 h. (A) The protein level of p-ERK. (B) The protein level of
  nuclear Nrf2. (C) The protein level of HO-1. Data are expressed as the mean ± SE.
  Values with different superscript letters are significantly different (p < 0.05).
