caption: Enrichment analysis of VDAC1-related genes. (a) The experimentally determined
  VDAC1-binding proteins were obtained by the STRING tool. (b) The VDAC1-related genes
  in TCGA projects were obtained through the GEPIA2 approach. In addition, the expression
  correlation analysis between VDAC1 and selected targeting genes, such as CHCHD3,
  CYCS, HSPA9, MDH2, and NDUFS, was conducted. (c) The corresponding heat map in the
  majority of cancers of TCGA and GTEx was supplied by TIMER tool. (d) The intersection
  analysis of the VDAC1-correlated genes and VDAC1-binding proteins was performed.
  (e) The effects of VDAC1 on tumor pathogenesis ware displayed by KEGG pathway analysis
  based on the VDAC1-related genes and proteins. (f) Furthermore, the net plot for
  the molecular function data was explored through GO enrichment analysis.
