caption: 'The PPAR-signaling pathway was enriched in hypertriglyceridemia acute promyelocytic
  leukemia samples. (A) Volcano plot of differential pathways in APL patients with
  high triglycerides vs. normal triglycerides. The 2 horizontal dashed lines denote
  a P-value cutoff of 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.3. Two-sided
  P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction. (B) The top 10 significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathways in APL patients with high triglycerides levels compared
  with APL with normal triglycerides levels. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis plot
  of the PPAR signaling signature genes in patients with high triglycerides levels
  vs. patients with normal triglycerides. (D) Violin plots showing the expression
  levels of PPAR in patients with high triglycerides and normal triglyceride levels.
