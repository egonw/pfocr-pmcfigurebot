caption: Nano‐DimerCPAP potently activated p53 signaling cascades beyond Nano‐MonoCPAP
  in vitro. A) Apoptosis and necrosis analysis of NCI‐1650 cells incubated with PBS,
  Nano‐DimerCPAP (10 µg mL−1), Nano‐MonoCPAP (10 µg mL−1) or CtrlNano via flow cytometry
  for 48 h (n = 3, mean ± sd). B) Cell cycle analysis of NCI‐1650 cells treated with
  Nano‐DimerCPAP, Nano‐MonoCPAP, CtrlNano or PBS control for 48 h by FACS (n = 3,
  mean ± sd). C) Heat map of RNA‐Seq analysis of NCI‐H1650 cells’ mRNAs which were
  differentially expressed between Nano‐DimerCPAP and CtrlNano (n = 3). D) GSEA results
  for the p53 signaling pathway and the p53 downstream pathway. GSEA results for the
  REACTOME cell cycle checkpoints, E) the REACTOME cell cycle mitotic and F) the KEGG
  apoptosis. G) Hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed in NCI‐H1650
  cells after exposure to Nano‐DimerCPAP for 24 h compared with Nano‐MonoCPAP (n = 3).
  H) GSEA analysis of Nano‐DimerCPAP versus Nano‐MonoCPAP showing the increased p53
  signaling and downstream pathway. I) GSEA showing that the apoptosis of Nano‐DimerCPAP
  is superior to Nano‐MonoCPAP.
