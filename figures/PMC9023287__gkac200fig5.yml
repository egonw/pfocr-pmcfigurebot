caption: 'Cancer-specific CNA patterns. (A) Rare pathways had opposite SWAN shifts
  relative to the majority of cancer types. Shown is the example of ‘GO: Positive
  regulation of neuron death’ which was uniquely upregulated in the brain cancer GBM,
  as illustrated in a (B) SWAN feather plot and (C) Circos plot. (D) Overall survival
  (OS), P is from Kaplan–Meier analysis. (E) Progression-free survival (PFS) plot.
  (F) SWAN Circos plot. (G) Progression-free survival (PFS) plot. (H) SWAN analysis
  scored by HPNE CRISPR-proliferation screen hits in place of haploinsufficiency.
  The most suppressed pathway by magnitude is highlighted. (I) The most frequently
  deleted genes from (H) pathway. (J) Integrative Genomics Viewer cohort summary plots
  for the new African-American enriched OV cohort (SCTR) compared to The Cancer Genome
  Atlas (TCGA) OV cohort. Noted genes indicate SWAN prioritized genes within indicated
  pathway. (K) EthSEQ analysis and principal component clustering of variants in the
  SCTR cohort. Self-identified race is labeled for black and white patients. (L) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis of TCGA tumors separated by self-identified race and plotted for overall
  survival. (M) Kaplan–Meier plot of TCGA data separated by SWAN shifts.'
