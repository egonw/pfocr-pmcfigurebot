caption: (A) Effect of Maslinic acid on mechanical withdrawal thresholds in MTrPs
  rats (n = 5). M.A. (5 mg/ml) after intramuscular injection at 0.25, 1, 2, 4, and
  8 h rescued the decrease of mechanical withdrawal threshold in MTrPs rats. (B).
  Expression of p-P65, P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC was detected 1 h after M.A. or DMSO
  injection, and the protein expression of p-P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC in the M.A.
  group was significantly lower than that in the MTrPs group. (C). The nuclear protein
  expression of MEF2C in the M.A. group was lower than that in the control group,
  with GAPDH as the cytoplasmic protein internal reference and Lamin B as the cytosolic
  protein internal reference. (D). The mRNA expression levels of MLCK, MEF2C, and
  MyoC in the M.A. group were significantly lower than those in the MTrPs group, using
  GAPDH as the internal reference mRNA.
