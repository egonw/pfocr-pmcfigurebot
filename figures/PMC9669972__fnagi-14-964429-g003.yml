caption: Metabolic profiling and altered metabolism-related pathways of hippocampus
  tissue in male aged mice. (A,B) Pie graph of the metabolites class composition of
  identified and significantly altered metabolites in the hippocampus of male aged
  mice. (C) Hierarchical heatmap analysis of the relative content of DEMs in hippocampus
  from male aged (O1–O3, n = 3) and young mice (Y1–Y3, n = 3). (D) Bubble illustration
  of top20 ranked enriched KEGG pathway terms. The diameter of the solid circle denotes
  the number of DEMs enriched and the color showing the p-value in the corresponding
  pathway.
