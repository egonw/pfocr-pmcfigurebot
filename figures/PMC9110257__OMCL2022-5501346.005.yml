caption: Effects of NAC treatment on LARS2 inhibited ERs and AKT/ERK cell signaling
  pathway. (a, b) Protein levels of GRP78, CHOP in KGN and mGC cells transfected with
  si-LARS2 followed by NAC, as determined by western blot. (c, d) Protein levels of
  AKT/ERK signaling pathway in KGN and mGC cells transfected with si-LARS2 followed
  by NAC, as determined by western blot. The data are presented as mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05.
