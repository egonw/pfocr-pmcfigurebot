caption: Aging alters intercellular interaction patterns. A The heatmap showing the
  number of communication interaction L-R among immune cell types in 20M. B The heatmap
  showing the number of communication interaction L-R among immune cell types in 2W.
  C Venn diagram showing the interaction of upregulated TFs respectively in two groups.
  D Representative GO biological process and pathways enriched in the upregulated
  TF-association genes in 20M. E Representative GO biological process and pathways
  enriched in the upregulated TF-association genes in 2W. F The dot plot showing the
  increased L-R signaling of hematopoietic stem cells to myeloid cells in 20M (left)
  and 2W (right). G The dot plot showing the increased L-R signaling of hematopoietic
  stem cells to lymphocytes in 20M (left) and 2W (right). H The circle plot showing
  the MIF signaling pathway network among immune cell types in 20M (up) and 2W (down).
  I The flow cytometry histograms (left) and column charts (right) showing the level
  of TNF-α in NEU cells in bone marrow and spleen (n = 5/group). Significance in I
  was calculated using Student’s t test; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
