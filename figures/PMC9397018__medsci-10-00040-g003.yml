caption: 'Combined model of bacterial polyamine utilization pathways (adapted from
  [,]). Central reactions and metabolic routes of polyamine catabolic pathways, as
  well as up-to-date polyamine uptake systems described in bacteria, are shown. ACP,
  acetylation pathway; GGP, gamma-glutamylation pathways (black box); AMTP, aminotransferase
  pathway; DOP, direct oxidation pathway; SPDP, spermine/spermidine dehydrogenase
  pathway. Dashed arrows represent predicted and straight arrows confirmed metabolic
  pathways. Pathways described for the following bacteriaâ€”in black: E. coli, P. aeruginosa,
  and S. coelicolor; dashed orange box: P. aeruginosa; dashed brown box: S. aureus
  and P. aeruginosa; dashed blue box: E. coli, B. subtilis, and C. glutamicum [,,,,,,,,,,,,,].'
