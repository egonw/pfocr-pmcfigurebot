caption: 'Downregulation of FEM1B inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
  of lung cancer cells. (a and b) FEM1B mRNA expression in NSCLC cells was significantly
  reduced after inhibiting FEM1B. (c) FEM1B was downregulated or miR-29b was overexpressed
  to inhibit the proliferation of A549 and NCI-H-1792 cells. (d and e) FEM1B was downregulated
  or miR-29b was overexpressed, and A549 cells inhibited the migration of NCI-H-1792
  cells. (f) Downregulation of FEM1B or overexpression of miR-29b inhibited the invasion
  of A549 and NCI-H-1792 cells. ∗P ≤ 0.05, comparison between the miR-29b group and
  NC-group. #P ≤ 0.05, comparison between the si-FEM1B group and NC group.'
