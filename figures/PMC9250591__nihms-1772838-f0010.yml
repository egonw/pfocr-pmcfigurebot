figure_title: Ectopic HHIP correlates with loss of HH signaling after chorda tympani/lingual
  nerve cut
caption: (A) X-Gal staining from Gli1lacZ/+ reporter in Control Typical FP/TB illustrates
  HH signaling in FP basal, perigemmal and stromal cells. (A’) HHIP immunostaining
  (red) in the same sections demonstrates expression in FILIF only (white arrows).
  (A’’) Merged images with TB cells (K8, green) indicate absence of HHIP and presence
  of Gli1lacZ in Typical FP/TB. (B-E) After 21 days of chorda tympani (CT)/lingual
  (LN) nerve cut, X-Gal staining from Gli1lacZ/+ reporter illustrates graded loss
  of HH signaling in FP basal and perigemmal cells. (B’-E’) HHIP immunostaining (red)
  in the same sections demonstrates an ectopic expression at FP apex in addition to
  the expression in FILIF (white arrows). (B’’-E’’) Merged images of Gli1lacZ, HHIP
  and TB cells (K8, green) indicate opposing expression patterns of Gli1lacZ and HHIP.
  (B-D) In Atypical FP/TB three different expression patterns of Gli1lacZ and HHIP
  are observed. (B-B’’) Gli1lacZ cells are retained in FP walls and there is no HHIP
  expression. (C-C’’) Gli1lacZ cells are gradually lost from one side of FP wall and
  HHIP expression is observed at the FP apex on the same side where Gli1lacZ is eliminated.
  (D-D’’) Gli1lacZ cells are completely eliminated from FP walls and perigemmal cells,
  and HHIP ectopically expressed at both sides of FP apex bracketing the TB remnant.
  (E-E’’) In Atypical FP/No TB there are no Gli1lacZ cells in FP and acquisition of
  HHIP in the entire FP apical area.
