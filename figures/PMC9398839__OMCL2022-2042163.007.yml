caption: 'PSG inhibited oxidative stress of the liver tissues in IBD mice. Effect
  of PSG on the levels of ROS (a) and MDA (b) in the liver tissues of IBD mice. The
  protein expressions of the Nrf2/Keap1/HO1/NQO1 pathway in the liver tissues were
  determined by Western blot assay (c) and quantitative analysis for Western blot
  results (n = 3) (d). (e) The protein expression of Nrf2 in the liver tissues was
  detected by IHC. Results were expressed as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01
  vs. the control group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. the model group (DSS only).'
