caption: 'SEMA3F significantly inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration and enhanced
  docetaxel chemosensitivity in prostate cancer. A Endogenous SEMA3F mRNA levels in
  different human PCa cell lines. Data are presented as means ± SD, two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. B RBM15 protein was determined in PCa samples and paired adjacent normal
  tissues. Data are presented as means ± SD, two-tailed unpaired t-test. C Kaplan–Meier
  disease free survival (DFS) curves were performed from GEPIA portal. D SEMA3F protein
  levels are markedly decreased in human PCa cell lines compared to RWPE-1 cells.
  E Transwell migration assays showed the inhibition of cell migration viabilities
  in SEMA3F overexpression DU-145 and PC-3 cells. F Overexpression of SEMA3F significantly
  inhibited the cell proliferation in DU-145 and PC-3 cells, Data are presented as
  means ± SD, two-tailed unpaired t-test. G Pulldown followed by western blot indicated
  in vitro binding of m6A-modified RNA: DNA hybrid probe (using SEMA3F promoter sequence
  ) with YTHDF2 in control and IGF2BPs overexpression PC-3 cells. H  Differently transfected
  PC-3 cells were treated with docetaxel. Cell viability was normalized to that of
  the corresponding cells treated with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). (Upper): Representative
  clone formation assay. (Lower): Quantification of clone formation assay. Data are
  represented as means ± SD. of n = 3 replicates. (I). Effect of SEMA3F overexpression
  on Hippo pathway in DU-145 and PC-3 cells by western blot assay. J Effect of SEMA3F
  overexpression and LATS1 inhibitor(TDI-011536) on Hippo pathway in DU-145 and PC-3
  cells by western blot assay. K Dose–response curves of differently transfected PC-3
  cells treated with docetaxel, LATS1 inhibitor(TDI-011536) and SEMA3F overexpression.
  Cell viability was normalized to that of the corresponding cells treated with dimethylsulphoxide
  (DMSO). Data are represented as means ± SD. of n = 3 replicates.  * p -value < 0.05,
