caption: SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit innate immune pathway activation. HEK293 T cells
  were transfected with reporter plasmids ISG56.1-firefly luciferase (Fluc) (A,B),
  ISRE-Fluc (C,D), or NF-κB-Fluc (E,F), TK-Renilla, and plasmids expressing the indicated
  SARS-CoV-2 proteins fused to a FLAG epitope at the C terminus. After 18 h, transfected
  cells were stimulated by infection with 40 HAU/ml SeV (A), 1,000 unit/ml IFN-α (C),
  or 40 ng/ml TNF-α (E). Cells in (B), (D), or (F) were transfected simultaneously
  with reporter plasmids and plasmids expressing IRF3-5D, IRF9-S2C or p65 to activate
  the IRF3 pathway, IRF9/STAT2-mediated ISG expression, or the NF-κB pathway, respectively.
  After stimulation (overnight infection with SeV, or 6 h with IFN-α or TNF-α), cell
  lysates were harvested, and firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized
  to Renilla luciferase control. The fold induction of firefly luciferase is shown
  relative to unstimulated controls. Data shown are from 4 technical replicates and
  are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars represent standard
  deviation. The p-values were calculated using the unpaired Student’s t-test relative
  to empty vector. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
