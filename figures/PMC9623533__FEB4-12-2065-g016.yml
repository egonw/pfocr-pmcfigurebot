caption: 'Excessive level of ER stress combined with inactivation of GADD34 affects
  PERK pathway on protein level. GADD34 inactivation via guanabenz treatment (50 μm
  for 1 h) was combined with a high level of ER stress (10 μm thapsigargin for 2 h)
  in HEK293T cells and then the cells were denoted in time. Control samples were not
  treated with any reagent (including DMSO). (upper panel) The markers of PERK pathway
  (i.e. eIF2α‐P, ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34) were followed by immunoblotting. GAPDH was
  used as the loading control. The full‐length blots are included in the . (lower
  panel) Densitometry data represent the intensity of ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34 normalized
  for GAPDH, while eIF2α‐P normalized for the total level of eIF2α. For each of the
  experiments, three complete biological repeat experiments were carried out. Error
  bars represent standard deviation. In the calculation of statistical significance,
  data from guanabenz pretreated samples were compared to the not pretreated samples
  with the corresponding treatment time of 10 μm thapsigargin (e.g. guanabenz pretreated
  control was compared to not pretreated control, and thapsigargin‐treated samples
  with the combination of guanabenz pretreatement were compared to the samples treated
  with thapsigargin for the same period of time). Results are presented as mean values ± SD
  and were compared using ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple comparison post hoc test. Asterisks
  indicate statistically significant difference from the appropriate control: *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01. GB, guanabenz; TG, thapsigargin.'
