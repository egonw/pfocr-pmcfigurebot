caption: 'Involvement of the three TBEs in the reporter activity. (A) Schematic representation
  of wild type (open circle: WWCAAAG, W: A/T) and mutant (closed circle: WWCAGCG)
  TCF-binding motifs in pGL4.23-MOSPD1-3′E reporter plasmids. (B) Relative reporter
  activity of empty, wild type and mutant reporter plasmids in HCT116 cells (Empty
  vector control, WT, TBE1-mut, TBE2-mut, TBE3-mut, or TBEall-mut). The data represent
  mean ± SD from three independent cultures. Statistical significance was determined
  by one-way ANOVA, followed by Turkey''s test; **P<0.01, as compared with siControl;
  ##P<0.01, as compared with pGL4.23-MOSPD1-3′E WT. TBEs, TCF-binding elements; WT,
  wild type; MOSPD1, motile sperm domain containing 1.'
