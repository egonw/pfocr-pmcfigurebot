caption: TCF1 and LEF1 regulated Wnt-dependent chemokine and cytokine-induced inflammation
  and cadherin signaling pathways. (A) Common genes regulated in three signaling pathways,
  including Wnt signaling pathway, chemokine and cytokine induced inflammation signaling
  pathway, and cadherin signaling pathway in TCF1 and LEF1 knockdown cells. (B) RT-qPCR
  of these targeted genes. (C) Model of the effect of TCF1/LEF1 regulate T-ALL cell
  migration through Wnt-dependent chemokine and cytokine-induced inflammation and
  cadherin signaling pathways.
