caption: Expression profiles of genes and proteins involved in the terpenoid synthesis
  pathway of F hirta. (A) Expression levels for genes in A- and B-phase of F hirta
  bracts were shown by heatmap according to log2 (FPKM). (B) Expression levels for
  proteins in A- and B-phase of F hirta bracts were shown by heatmap according to
  log10 (Protein Abundance). CuA and CuB represent A phase and B phase of F hirta
  bracts, respectively.
