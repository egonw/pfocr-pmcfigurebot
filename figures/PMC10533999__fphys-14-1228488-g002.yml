caption: 'Assays demonstrating that Mylk −/−  SM retained contractile activity: (A)
  Umbilical arteries from WT and mylk1 −/−  E18.5 embryos developed different magnitudes
  of force in response to high [K+]. Following permeabilization with α-toxin, phosphatase
  inhibitor calyculin A (100 nM) induced comparable magnitudes of maximal force in
  the mylk1 −/−  and the WT littermate vessels in pCa > 8 EGTA buffered solution.
  Ratios of calyculin A high [K+] in the graph demonstrate the reduced high [K+] compared
  to maximal force in the mylk1 −/−  compared to WT. (B) Different rates of contraction
  in response to high [K+] occur in WT compared to mylk1 −/−  in both bladder and
  umbilical arteries. Graph, the half-time of high [K+] contractions in mylk1 −/−
  SM strips was significantly greater than wildtype in both bladder (p < 0.0001) and
  arteries (p < 0.05). (C) Mylk1 −/−  SM contracts in responses to increasing [Ca2+]i,
  in α-toxin permeabilized bladder E18.5 mylk1 −/−  vs. WT SM strips. Left panel,
  pCa-tension responses. Graph, pCa-tension curve normalized to force at pCa 4.5 (100%).
  The magnitude of contractile force was less but the sensitivity to Ca2+ was not
  significantly different in mylk1 −/−  vs. WT bladder SM (n = 10 and 3 biological
  replicates respectively). (D) Activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by addition
  of 10 μM GTPγS to α-toxin permeabilized WT and mylk1 −/−  bladder in pCa 6.3 solution.
  The ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, 5 and 10 μM relaxed the GTPγS-induced contractions.
  Graphs showed that the magnitude of GTPγS-induced contractions did not significantly
  differ between mylk1 −/−  and WT SM (n = 4 and 5 biological replicates respectively)
  but that the Y27632-induced relaxation of GTPγS-induced contractions was greater
  in the mylk1 −/−  SM compared to WT (p < 0.01, n = 5 and 6 biological replicates
  respectively).'
