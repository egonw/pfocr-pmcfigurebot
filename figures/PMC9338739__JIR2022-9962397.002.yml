caption: Identification of differentially expressed immune-related genes related to
  efficacy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seven cases of bladder cancer tissues
  before neoadjuvant chemotherapy were divided into a favorable prognosis group (n
  = 4) and a poor prognosis group (n = 3) according to the final curative effect.
  (a) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed genes. (b) Bar plot showing the
  differentially expressed genes with significant fold change. (c) Hierarchical clustering
  heatmap showing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of gene signatures. (d) Chord
  diagram showing the top 5 enriched KEGG terms for 6 differentially expressed genes.
  (e) The Spearman correlation analysis between therapeutic effect score and monocyte.
  (f) The Spearman correlation analysis between therapeutic effect score and neutrophil.
  (g) The Spearman correlation analysis between pathological score and Th1 cell. (h)
  The pathway interaction network showing the relationship with pathological score
  and therapeutic effect score by IPRSE analysis. P values in the (a) and (b) subfigures
  were calculated by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while P values in the (e–h) subfigures
  were calculated by Spearman correlation analysis. Differences were found to be statistically
  significant at ∗P < 0.05.
