caption: 'Effects of Bifidobacterium infantis and programmed cell death ligand inhibition
  on the proportion of CD4+, CD25+, and forkhead box protein 3+ cells in the blood.
  A: The strategy of CD4+, CD25+, and forkhead box protein (Foxp) 3+ cells; B-F: Flow
  cytometry results for the control group (B), the DSS model group (C), the DSS +
  B. infantis group (D), the DSS + B. infantis + anti-PD-L1 group (E), the DSS + anti-PD-L1
  group (F); G: Statistical chart of the numbers of CD4+, CD25+, and Foxp3+ cells.
  Data are presented as mean Â± SD, and the comparisons among each group were analyzed
  by one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set as P < 0.05. PD-1:
  Programmed cell death 1; PD-L1: Programmed cell death ligand; DSS: Dextran sulfate
  sodium; B. infantis: Bifidobacterium infantis; Foxp3+: Forkhead box protein 3+;
  CD: Cluster of differentiation; SSC: Side scatter; FSC: Forward scatter; FL: Fluorescence;
  APC: Allophycocyanin; FITC: Fluorescein isothiocyanate; H: Height.'
