caption: 'TEM revealed a decreased collagen density with normal collagen diameter
  in Smad4kera-cko. (A,B) TEM revealed the organization of collagen in different orientation
  including vertical and parallel to the sectioning surface of both the Smad4Ctrl
  and Smad4kera-cko. (C,D) For those collagens that is vertical to the sectioning
  surface, we perform the collagen density calculation and collagen diameter measuring.
  (E) Collagen density is decreased in the Smad4kera-cko compared to those in the
  Smad4Ctrl (362.17 ± 6.29 vs. 322.17 ± 5.08, n = 6, p = 0.0007, ***). (F) Collagen
  diameter measurement showed no significant difference between Smad4kera-cko and
  Smad4Ctrl (n = 6, p = 0.9758, ns). Abbreviation: ns, not significant.'
