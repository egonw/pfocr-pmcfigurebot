caption: PDLSCs repressed autophagy and angiogenic capacity under inflammatory microenvironment.
  (a, b) mRNA and protein expression levels of Beclin1 and LC3B compared to β-actin
  through qPCR and western blot. (c, d) mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF-a,
  FGF-2, and IGF-1 compared to β-actin through qPCR and western blot. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3); ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
