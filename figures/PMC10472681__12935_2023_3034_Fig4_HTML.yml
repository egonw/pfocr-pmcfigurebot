caption: Knockdown of BRF2 inhibits HCC progression. (a, b) The transfection efficiency
  of si1/2-MALAT1 in Huh7 and Hep3B cells was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot.
  (c, d) After silencing BRF2, cell viability of Huh7 and Hep3B cells was detected
  by CCK-8 assay on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. (e) Colony formation assays were used
  to determine the role of BRF2 in HCC cell colony formation. (f-h) Transwell assay
  and cell scratch assay were used to detect migration and invasion of hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells after BRF2 down-regulation. (i) The apoptosis rate of HCC cells
  after BRF2 knockdown was detected by flow cytometry. (j) Western blot analysis was
  performed to detect the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in HCC cells
  after BRF2 knockdown. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001

  via inhibiting the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway.
