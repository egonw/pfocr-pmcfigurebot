caption: A hypothesis-based immune response model. In the course of tumor growth,
  the tumor microenvironment (TME) accumulates high concentrations of immune-suppressive
  cytokines/growth factors, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and vascular
  endothelial growth factor. Under their action, immunosuppressive cells (black cells),
  regulatory T-cells, and myeloid cells, will prevail in the tumor environment. Dentric
  cells (DCs) become tolerogenic and immune effector cells cannot infiltrate the tumor
  (1). After high-dose irradiation (2), many immune pathways are activated. Firstly,
  high-dose radiotherapy (HDRT) will cause tumor cell necrosis and the release of
  tumor cell debris, which can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Secondly,
  HDRT causes dsDNA release, triggering the cGAS-STING-IFN-1 pathway. In addition,
  HDRT upregulates cell surface molecules such as MHC-1/Fas/NKG2D. Activated APCs
  then migrate to the lymph nodes, where they educate and prime cytotoxic T-cells
  (3). Cytotoxic T-cells will enter the bloodstream (4) to reach primary and distant
  tumor sites and kill tumor cells. However, these effector immune cells might not
  be able to enter primary or distant tumor stroma because of immune-suppressive barriers
  that are formed naturally or after HDRT. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) enhances immune
  cells infiltration and diminishes immune-suppressive cells and cytokines, acting
  in a similar way to an immune-modulator (5). LDRT can be applied to the local tumor
  which has received HDRT or other tumor lesions, which remains to be explored by
  more studies. After LDRT, the activated immune cells successfully enter the primary
  and distant tumor issue, eradicating tumor cells, and causing abscopal effect (6).
  The crucial timing of LDRT needs to be explored by future studies in order to avoid
  effector immune cell depletion.
