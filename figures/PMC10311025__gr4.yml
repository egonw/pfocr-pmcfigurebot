caption: 4-OI inhibited the ROS production, thereby inhibiting the activation of MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. (A–G) 4-OI significantly reduced the expression levels of p-JNK,
  p-P38, p-ERK, and p-P65, and promoting the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 in RAW264.7 cells.
  (H, I) LPS promoted macrophage ROS production and 4-OI inhibited the ROS production
  in RAW264.7 cells. (J) Flow cytometry results showed that the macrophage purity
  reached 90%. (K, L) 4-OI significantly inhibited the expression of p-P38, p-ERK,
  and p-P65, and promote the expression of NRF2/HO-1 in BMDMs. Data are shown as the
  mean ± SD, ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
