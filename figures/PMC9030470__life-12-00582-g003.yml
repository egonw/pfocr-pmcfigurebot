caption: 'Polycomb Group Complexes (PRCs) in OA: Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)
  and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are protein complexes that contribute to
  chromatin compaction to regulate development, cell proliferation, and differentiation.
  In OA, dysregulation of PRCs contributes to increased inflammation and aberrant
  Wnt pathway signaling activation, resulting in premature chondrocytes differentiation
  and accelerated chondrocyte hypertrophy differentiation.'
