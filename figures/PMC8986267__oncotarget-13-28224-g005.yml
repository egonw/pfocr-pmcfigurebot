figure_title: Proteomic assessment of the functional consequences of ATP6AP2 and Gene
  ontology based functional annotation
caption: (A) Volcano plot displaying the total proteome and differentially expressed
  proteins following transfection; 3 proteins were upregulated (FC ≥ 1.5 and P ≤ 0.05)
  and 19 were down regulated (FC ≤ 0.667 and P ≤ 0.05). (B) Histogram confirming the
  loss of (P)RR expression following transfection. (C) Broad biological function and
  molecular and cellular function (D) as determined by licensed Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis software (IPA®, Qiagen) utilizing the ‘canonical pathway, disease and function’
  analyses, which returned P-values (an enrichment measurement based on the number
  of proteins that map to a particular pathway, function or regulator), and Z-score,
  which is a prediction scoring system that assesses activation or inhibition of a
  given pathway or function based upon statistically significant patterns in the dataset
  and prior biological knowledge previously manually curated in the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. C. Cancer = cervical cancer. Mean ± SEM values are plotted in the histogram.
  ***P < 0.001.
