caption: 'Induction of hypertrophy by WNT7A variants containing the hairpin region
  is depending on the AKT/mTOR pathway. A) Experimental scheme depicting the hypertrophy
  assay and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin with conditioned media containing the
  different WNT7A variants. d: days. B) C2C12 cells were incubated with conditioned
  media containing the different WNT7A variants and rapamycin or a control at day
  3 of differentiation and differentiated for 2 additional days. The myotube diameter
  was assessed at day 5 of differentiation. n = 3. Two-way ANOVA, *=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01,
  ***=p < 0.001, ****=p < 0.0001, ns: not significant. C) Representative images of
  the quantification shown in D). MYOSIN HEAVY CHAIN (MHC) in green, MYOGENIN in red,
  nuclei in blue. Scale bar: 100 μm. D) C2C12 cells were incubated with conditioned
  media containing the different WNT7A variants and LY294002 or a control at day 2
  of differentiation and differentiated for 4 additional days. The myotube diameter
  was assessed at day 6 of differentiation. n = 4. Two-way ANOVA, *=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01,
  ***=p < 0.001, ****=p < 0.0001, ns: not significant.'
