caption: Phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase/AKT is a downstream signaling pathway of growth
  arrest‐specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs). (A)
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis results shows that
  the PI3K/AKT pathway was closely related to GAS5 in TAMs. (B) Pathway reporter assay
  shows that the GAS5–microRNA‐21 (miR‐21)–PTEN axis could repress the PI3K/AKT pathway
  in THP‐1 cells (n = 3). (C) Western blot results confirm that GAS5 inhibits the
  PI3K/AKT pathway in TAMs (n = 3). (D, E) Immunohistochemistry and western blot results
  indicate that the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated in EC and primary TAMs (n = 3).
  (F–I) Flow cytometry results show that AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 induces phagocytic
  effects of macrophages on primary EC cells and EC cell line. Treatment of GAS5 knockdown
  (KD) macrophages with LY294002 represses the LY294002‐induced phagocytosis of macrophages
  (n = 3). (F–I) Data are shown as mean ± SEM; p values were determined by independent
  sample t‐tests. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. NC, negative control
