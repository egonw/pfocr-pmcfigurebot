caption: 'Fatty acid metabolism in GBM cancer cells is linked to cell fate. (A) Desaturation
  activity of SCD (palmitate-to-palmitoleate ratio) and FADS2 (sapienate-to-palmitate
  ratio) in fresh frozen GBM tissue from eight patients (patient details in ). (B)
  Desaturation activity of SCD (palmitate-to-palmitoleate ratio) and FADS2 (sapienate-to-palmitate
  ratio) in human cell lines: hepatocellular carcinoma (HUH7), lung adenocarcinoma
  (A549), immortalized GBM cells (U87, U251, U118, LN18) and patient-derived GBM cell
  lines (LBT 001, LBT 002, CME 005, CME 037, CME 038, LBT 070, LBT 086, LBT 096, LBT
  123, CME 014, CME 016, CME 035, CME 036) (patient details corresponding to cell
  lines in ). Color scale represents mean desaturation activity (n=3). HUH7, U87,
  U251, LN18, U118 were cultured in 1% FBS medium, A549 cells were cultured in 0.5%
  FBS medium. Patient-derived GBM cells were cultured in NSA medium without FBS. (C)
  Brief overview of the fatty acid mono-desaturation pathway. (D) Average gene expression
  levels of FASN, SCD1 and FADS2 in cancer cell sub-clusters of interest (SC: 6, 7,
  8, 11, 17) among those in . The color scale indicates Z-scores, based on the overall
  mean expression level (and associated standard deviation) for each gene across all
  sub-cluster. (E) GSVA scores for gene sets representing different GBM cell fates
  in cancer cell sub-clusters of interest (SC: 6, 7, 8, 11, 17) among those in . The
  color scale indicates Z-scores, based on the overall mean GSVA score (and associated
  standard deviation) for each gene set across all sub-clusters. MES, mesenchymal;
  AC, astrocytic cells; OPC, oligodendrocytic precursor cell; NPC, neuronal progenitor
  cell.'
