figure_title: STING-related proteins were significantly increased in liver fibrosis
  tissues from liver cancer patients
caption: (A) Samples from liver cancer patients, HE, Masson, and Sirius red staining
  confirmed the occurrence of liver fibrosis in the samples. Scale bar 20 µm. (B)
  Fluorescence staining of the HSC activation indicators α-SMA and cGAS in liver tissue
  sections. Scale bar 50 µm. (C) WBs and quantitative analysis show high protein expression
  of cGAS and STING in liver tumor tissue. Adjacent sample versus tumor sample (n=3)
  *p<0.05. α-SMA, alpha smooth muscle actin; cGAS, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine
  monophosphate synthase; STING, stimulator of interferon genes.
