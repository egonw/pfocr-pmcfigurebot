caption: Gene set enrichment analyses. A) Bar plots for normalized enrichment scores
  from gene set enrichment analysis of the expression changes (ICU vs NON-ICU) against
  MSigDB Hall mark gene sets. Shown are FDR q < 0.05. B) Gene set enrichment analysis
  of the genes sorted by the expression changes (ICU vs NON-ICU; the blue-to-red spectrum)
  against gene set “ROS Pathway” (vertical bars) with top leading genes shown on the
  left bottom and heatmap visualization of the gene expression for all leading genes
  shown on the right. C) similar to B but for the gene set “IFN-α response). (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the Web version of this article.)
