figure_title: The EGFR signaling pathway mediates the Fas2 cell autonomous function
  to promote imaginal disc growth
caption: '(A) Eye imaginal discs deficient for Fas2 display reduced levels of activated-MAPK
  (anti-ppERK). Top panels, strong expression of activated-MAPK is evident in the
  Morphogenetic Furrow of the eye disc (white arrowhead) and the Ring Gland (RG, arrow)
  of control siblings (CyO balancer siblings). Bottom panels, in contrast ey-driven
  FLP-OUT eye discs expressing UAS-fas2RNAi(#34084) show a strong reduction of the
  ppERK signal, especially evident in the Morphogenetic Furrow (green arrowhead).
  Note that the Ring Gland (RG, white arrow), where ey-FLP is not expressed, serves
  as an internal control for the normal activated-MAPK signal. The right panels show
  a LUT color coded representation of activated-MAPK signal levels (signal quantified
  in ). Bar: 50 μm. (B) The fas2 wing phenotype is sensitive to the dosage of the
  EGFR and wts genes. fas2eB112/fas2e76 wings show a reduction in size which is enhanced
  by a reduction of 50% in the dosage of EGFR (Egfrtop2w74/+). Reciprocally, the fas2
  LOF phenotype is suppressed by a reduction of 50% in the dosage of wts (wtsX1/+)
  (WT and fas2eB112/fas2e76 as in ). All individuals are female. Wing size is wing
  area in μm2/103. N is number of individuals. (C) Functional interactions between
  fas2 and Egfr LOF mutations. The size of fas2eB112/fas2e76 and fas2RNAi34084 (driven
  by heterozygous MS1096-GAL4/+) adult wings (grey bars) is significantly smaller
  than WT (white bar). Egfr hypomorphic combinations (Egfrtop1/Egfrtop1, t1, and Egfrtop1/Egfrtop2W74,
  t1/t2W) display a wing size smaller than WT and fas2eB112/fas2e76 (striped white
  bars), and more similar to that caused by the expression of UAS-fas2RNAi34084. The
  wing size of the double mutant combinations of fas2eB112/fas2e76 with the Egfr allelic
  combinations is more similar to the Egfr mutants (striped grey bars), and shows
  a clear epistatic interaction with the stronger fas2RNAi34084 condition. Note that
  the combination with Egfrtop1/Egfrtop2W74 still causes some enhancement, but far
  from the value expected for an additive effect of the fas2 and Egfr phenotypes (red
  lines). Controls as in . All individuals are female. Wing size is wing area in μm2/103.
  N is number of individuals. (D) Rescue of the fas2– phenotype by activated-EGFR
  (λEgfr) in adult (left), late pupa (middle) and the wing imaginal disc. At left,
  an adult fas2eB112λEgfr MARCM clone in the notum marked with yellow and forked (outlined
  in green) showing a rescued size. Middle, fas2eB112λEgfr coupled-MARCM clones in
  the notum (GFP) displaying a rescued size similar to their normal fas2+ control
  twins (labeled with mtdTomato). Right, fas2eB112λEgfr coupled-MARCM clone and control
  twin (labeled with mtdTomato) in the wing disc. (E) Expression of activated-Raf
  (UAS-RafGOF), but not of activated-FGFR (UAS-λhtl) or activated-InR (UAS-InRDEL),
  rescues fas2-deficient clone growth. Left, 2nd instar larva FLP-OUT UAS-fas2RNAi#34084UAS-RafGOF/+
  clones. Middle, 2nd instar larva FLP-OUT UAS-fas2RNAi#34084UAS-λhtl/+ clone. Right,
  2nd instar larva coupled-MARCM fas2eB112; UAS-InRDEL/+ clones (GFP, absent) and
  their control twins (mtdTomato). A similar result was obtained with the expression
  of UAS-InRR418P. (F) y fas2eB112f36a MARCM 2nd instar larva clone size in adults
  is rescued by activated EGFR (UAS-λEgfr/+). Clone size is number of y f36a chaetes.
  N is number of clones. (G) The mitotic index (relative to WT, as in ) in fas2–λEgfr
  clones is highly increased, while the 2–3 cell rim of fas2+ cells around the clone
  shows the same value than in the rim of fas2+ cells around fas2– clones (compare
  with ). N is number of clones.'
