figure_title: Effects of mTOR pathway manipulation on high mTOR cohort
caption: '(A) Representative western: MK-2206 treatment of I-ASD-2 neural precursor
  cells (NPCs) leads to reduction of p-S6 in I-ASD-2 to Sib-2 levels without changing
  total S6. (B) Quantification of PS6/S6 western blots showing decreased PS6 in I-ASD-2
  but no change in Sib-2 with MK-2206 treatment. (C) MK-2206 rescues neurite outgrowth
  in high mTOR I-ASD-2 without changing Sib-2 neurites. (D) MK-2206 rescues migration
  in high mTOR I-ASD-2 without changing Sib-2 migration. (E) Representative western:
  SC-79 treatment of Family-2 NPCs increases p-S6 in Sib-2 to the level of I-ASD-2
  without changing total S6. (F) Quantification of Veh vs.SC-79 westerns showing increased
  PS6 in Sib-2 but no change in I-ASD-2. (G) Treatment of Sib-2 with SC-79 diminished
  neurite to the level of I-ASD-2. (H) Treatment of Sib-2 with SC-79 diminished migration
  to the level of I-ASD-2. (I) Proof of principal western: MK-2206 treatment of 16pDel
  NPCs leads to reduction of p-S6 in 16pDel NPCs to NIH levels without changing total
  S6. (J) In high mTOR 16pDel NPCs, MK-2206 treatment rescues neurites without significantly
  affecting NIH NPCs. (K) Proof of principle western: SC-79 treatment of NIH NPCs
  leads to increase in p-S6 to the level of 16pDel NPCs without changing total S6.
  (L) Treatment of NIH NPCs with SC-79 diminishes neurite outgrowth to 16pDel levels
  without affecting 16pDel NPCs. For all graphs: p≤0.05 = *, p≤0.01 = **, p≤0.001
  = ***, p≤0.0001 = ****, two-way ANOVA. For detailed N values please see .'
