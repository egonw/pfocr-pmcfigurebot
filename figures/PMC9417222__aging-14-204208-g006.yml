caption: IL-17D promotes TAM infiltration via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in lung
  cancer. (A and B) The relative mRNA levels of genes related to macrophages recruitment
  and polarization were measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
  RNA was purified from A549 cells expressing IL-17D treated with SB203580, IL-17D
  treated with DMSO, or empty vector treated with DMSO (A). RNA was purified from
  LLC1 cells expressing IL-17D treated with SB203580, IL-17D treated with DMSO, or
  empty vector treated with DMSO (B). Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. (C) Representative
  images of recruited macrophages. Scale bars, 100 μm. (D) Quantification of recruited
  macrophages. Mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001. (E) Proposed model for mechanism of IL-17D
  inducing TAMs infiltration into the TME. High expression of IL-17D in lung cancer
  cells activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway through binding to receptor complexes
  of lung cancer cells, which upregulates TAM recruitment– and polarization–related
  genes expression and promotes infiltration of TAMs in lung cancer.
