caption: No difference in the severity of the symptoms 24 (a) and 48 h (b) after MCAO.
  Points awarded for each noted neurological deficit were added for each animal. Individual
  scores were divided into five groups, and percentages of tested animals belonging
  to each group are shown. The severity of the symptoms was analysed with the Kruskal–Wallis
  test. Number of animals is shown in brackets. Lesion size showed a positive correlation
  with neurological scores both 24 (c) and 48 h (d) after MCAO. Data were analysed
  with the Pearson correlation test
