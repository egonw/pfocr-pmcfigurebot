caption: 'The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), its bypass loops, and converging signaling
  pathways. In the classical RAS (blue), angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin
  I (ATI) by renin. ATI is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE). ATII is the main effector for the RAS that binds to ATII receptor
  1 (AT1R) and ATII receptor 2 (AT2R) to exert its physiological effects. Angiotensin
  1–7 (Ang1–7) is a cleavage product of ATII which binds to the G protein–coupled
  receptor MAS receptor (MASR), which in turn exerts physiological effects. ATII is
  converted to angiotensin III (ATIII) by aminopeptidase A. ATII and ATIII bind to
  both AT1R and AT2R. Proteases including cathepsins B, D, and G, and chymase constitute
  bypass loops of the RAS (red), providing redundancies to this system. Other signaling
  pathways converge on the RAS (green) with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway being
  upstream of the RAS, activated by the prorenin receptor. Inflammatory signaling
  via the NOX-ROS-NFκB-COX2 axis, downstream of the RAS, is induced by activation
  of AT1R. Abbreviations: COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; EMT,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; NOX, NADPH oxidase; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa
