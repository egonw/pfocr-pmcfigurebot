caption: 'Bile acid biosynthesis and intestinal reabsorption under the fasting‐refeeding
  cycle. Bile acid (BA) synthesis pathways in liver (A). The enzymes required for
  the synthesis of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The classic
  pathway of  BA synthesis is initiated by the rate‐limiting enzyme cholesterol 7α‐hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) to specifically hydroxylate cholesterol at the 7α position, forming 7α‐hydroxycholesterol.
  7α‐hydroxycholesterol is converted to 7α‐hydroxy‐4‐cholesten‐3‐one (C4) by 3β‐hydroxy‐∆5‐C27‐steroid
  dehydrogenase (HSD3B7). Sterol 12α‐hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes 12α‐hydroxylation
  of C4 to 7α, 12α‐dihydroxy‐4‐cholesten‐3‐one, which is then converted to 5β‐cholestan‐3α,
  7α, 12α‐triol by aldo‐keto reductase family 1 member D1 (AKR1D1). CYP8B1 is required
  for CA synthesis. Without CYP8B1, C4 is converted to 5β‐cholestan‐3α, 7α‐diol for
  CDCA synthesis. Mitochondrial sterol 27‐hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalyzes the steroid
  side chain oxidation of 5β‐cholestan‐3α, 7α, 12α‐triol, which is subsequently converted
  to CA. The alternative BAs pathway in the liver is initiated by CYP27A1, which converts
  cholesterol to 27‐hydroxycholesterol and then to 3β‐hydroxy‐5‐cholestenoic acid.
  A nonspecific oxysterol 7α‐hydroxylase (CYP7B1) hydroxylates cholestenoic acid to
  7α‐hydroxy‐3‐oxo‐4‐cholestanoic acid. In mouse liver, most CDCA is converted to
  α‐muricholic acid (α MCA) by a species‐specific sterol 6β‐hydroxylase (CYP2C70),
  and then the 7α‐OH group in α MCA is isomerized to a 7β‐OH group to form β MCA.
  MCAs are the primary BAs synthesized in mouse liver. The 7α‐OH group in CDCA can
  be isomerized to 7β‐OH to form ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Primary unconjugated
  BAs are subsequently conjugated to glycine or taurine by BA: CoA synthetase (BACS)
  and BA‐CoA: amino acid N‐acyltransferase (BAAT) (A). Real‐time polymerase chain
  reaction (PCR) results of BA‐ biosynthesis‐related genes in liver tissue (CYP27A1,
  CYP7A1, CYP7B1, CYP8B1, CYP2C70, HSD3B1, AKR1D1, BAAT, and BACS) (B). Real‐time
  PCR results of intestinal reabsorption‐related genes in ileum tissue [organic solute
  transporter‐α (OST‐α), OST‐β and apical sodium dependent BA transporter (ASBT)]
  (C). A one‐way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni''s post hoc test was
  used to evaluate the significance of differences between the indicated groups; n = 12
  (B and C). *p < .05, **p < .01.'
