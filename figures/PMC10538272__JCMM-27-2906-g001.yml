caption: The mechanism of Pi stress‐mediated tumour inhibition. Pi stress blocks the
  Stat3 and Stat6 signalling pathways of macrophages and activates the NF‐кB signalling
  pathway of macrophages, together reprogramming TAMs to the M1 phenotype and increasing
  CD4+ T and CD8+ T‐cell infiltration. Low‐Pi stress simultaneously inhibits Treg
  cells, contributing to CD4+ T and CD8+ T‐cell activation and tumour suppression.
article_title: Irreversible repolarization of tumour‐associated macrophages by low‐Pi
  stress inhibits the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
