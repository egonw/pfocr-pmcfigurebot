caption: (A) The chemical structure of myricetin. (B)Myricetin reduces the viability
  of the AGSgastric cancer cell. The AGSgastric cancer cell viability was measured
  by MTT assay after treatment with different concentrations of myricetin (0, 5, 10,
  15, 20, 25, and 30 μM) for 24 h. The results are representative of three independent
  experiments. ∗p < 0.05 vs. untreated control group.
article_title: Myricetin induces apoptosis and autophagy in human gastric cancer cells
  through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
