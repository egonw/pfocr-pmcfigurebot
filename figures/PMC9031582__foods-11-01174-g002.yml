caption: 'KEGG analysis of the DEMs in (a) F CK0/36 CK0; (b) F 2 min/36 2 min; and
  (c) F 15 min/36 15 min. Note: The ordinate refers to metabolic pathway; abscissa
  is the enrichment factor (Enrichment factor = the number of metabolites with significant
  difference/the number of total metabolites in the pathway). The color change from
  red to green means that the p-value increases successively.'
