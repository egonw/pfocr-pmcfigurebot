caption: Activation of XBP1-mediated hepatocellular mitophagy and pyroptosis and macrophage
  STING signaling pathway in patients with ALI.Human liver tissues were collected
  from five patients with ALI and five controls. (A) IHC XBP1s-stained liver tissue
  sections. Scale bar, 50 . Immunofluorescence staining of liver tissue sections from
  each group. Albumin (pink), LC3 (red), cleaved caspase-1 (green), GSDMD-NT (yellow),
  and DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 50  (B) and CD68 (yellow), cGAS (red), STING (pink),
  P-TBK1 (green) and DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 50  (C). Data are presented as the mean  SEM
  (n = 5). *P , **P , ***P . NS, not significant; IHC, immunohistochemistry. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the Web version of this article.)
