caption: The GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the target genes. (a)â€“(c)
  The top 10 GO enrichment terms of the target genes based on biological processes
  (BP), cell compositions (CC), and molecular functions (MF). (d) The top 10 KEGG
  pathways analysis terms of the target genes. The three parameters of gene ratio,
  gene count, and -log10 (P value) were used to evaluate enrichment items.
