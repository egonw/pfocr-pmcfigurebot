caption: Activation and inhibition of the HOCl signaling pathway. HOCl signaling is
  induced in the plasma membrane of the cell. (a) Cancer cells may produce a higher
  amount of superoxides than normal cells. These superoxides are converted to hydrogen
  peroxide with the help of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Since hydrogen peroxide is
  toxic to the cell, the cancer cell produces membrane-bound catalase, which neutralizes
  the hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide plays an essential role in HOCl signaling
  that causes cell death. (b) Singlet oxygen produced by the photodynamic therapy
  has been found to inhibit catalase activity, so in the absence of catalase activity,
  hydrogen peroxide piles up, which triggers peroxidase (POD) to initiate HOCl signaling.
  The HOCl signaling causes immunogenic modulation that triggers the immune system
  to eradicate cancer cells.
