caption: Confirmation of Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) induced
  early apoptosis using Annexin‐V/PI assay. (A–C) MCF‐7 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of CSLME (2 mg and 5 mg/ml) and vehicle control (DMSO 0.1%) for 48 h.
  The cells were subjected to Annexin‐V/PI staining, percentage of apoptotic population
  was analyzed by using flowcytometry
