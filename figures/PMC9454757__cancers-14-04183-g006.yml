caption: 'MiRNA-188-5p was sponged by circRNA-0044301 and was associated with GC patients’
  prognosis. (A) AGO2-RIP assay results of circRNA-0044301 in HGC-27. (B) qRT-PCR
  of the expression of miRNAs in si-circRNA-0044301 and nc-circRNA-0044301 groups.
  (C) Luciferase reporter assay experiment in 293T cells co-transfected with circRNA-0044301
  (mu or wt) and miRNA-188-5p (mimics or nc); the luciferase activity of the 293T
  cells transfected with circRNA-0044301 wt (wt-circRNA-0044301) sequence was significantly
  reduced but no significant inhibitory effect was observed in those transfected with
  the circRNA-0044301 mu sequence (mu-circRNA-0044301), (***: p < 0.001; ns: no difference).
  (D) Survival curve of GC patients less than or equal to 56 years in the high- and
  low miRNA-188 expression groups showed that a low miRNA-188 expression level was
  significantly associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.017). (E) Survival curve of
  GC patients more than 56 and less than or equal to 75 years in the high and low
  miRNA-188 expression groups showed no difference (p = 0.859). (F) Survival curve
  of GC patients more than 75 years old in the high and low miRNA-188 expression groups
  showed that a high miRNA-188 expression level was significantly associated with
  a poor prognosis of GC patients (p = 0.048).'
