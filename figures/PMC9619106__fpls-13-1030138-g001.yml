caption: The qRT-PCR-based transcription analysis of the three NaCl-responsive genes
  in the DM plantlets under NaCl stress. Gene expression is normalized relative to
  the potato reference gene StActin97. Data presented as mean ± standard error from
  three biological replicates were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
  Different letters represent statistically significant differences (α = 0.05). S1,
  S2, S3, and S4, represent the aboveground parts of DM text-tube plantlets under
  200-mM NaCl treatment for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively; CK represents the aboveground
  parts of DM text-tube plantlets after 24 h treatment with MS liquid medium (the
  same below).
