caption: Genetic and chemical inhibition of ESCRT/lysosomal protein degradation pathway
  confirm its role as direct negative regulator of SLC20A1 protein levels.A, left,
  immunoblot of SLC20A1 protein levels in sgVPS37A-HEK293T and sgCHMP6-HEK293T cells
  with sgControl (top panel). Immunoblots of VPS37A (middle panel) and CHMP6 (bottom
  panel) were performed for assessment of gene targeting efficiency. β-actin was used
  as loading control. Representative data of two experiments are shown. SLC20A1/β-actin
  abundance was determined by densitometry and normalized to the control group (top).
  Right, SLC20A1 mRNA expression of sgVPS37A and sgCHMP6 cells with sgControl cells
  was normalized to 36B4. n = 4. Bars represent mean ± SD. B, SLC20A1 immunoblot in
  HEK293T cells treated with lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or proteasome
  inhibitor MG-132 versus DMSO control for 24 h (top panel). β-actin was used as loading
  control (middle panel). SLC20A1/β-actin abundance was determined by densitometry
  and normalized to the DMSO group (top). Efficiency of BafA1 and MG-132 treatment
  was assessed using ubiquitin immunoblot, which was exposed for optimized visualization
  of smaller proteins (bottom panel). C, HEK293T cells were transfected with CHMP6-EGFP
  expression plasmid for 24 h (green in overlayed image) to induce arrest of ESCRT-mediated
  protein trafficking. Cells were then stained with SLC20A1 antibody and Alexa 594–coupled
  secondary antibody (magenta in overlayed image) and subjected to confocal imaging.
  DAPI was used as nuclear marker. White arrows denote colocalization between SLC20A1
  and CHMP6-EGFP. Presented data are representative images of three experiments. The
  scale bars represent 10 μm. D, phosphate uptake in sgVPS37A and sgCHMP6 HEK293T
  cells was measured with sgControl cells as control (n = 3). Bars represent mean ±
  SD. Presented results are representative of two independent experiments. Ct, average
  cycle threshold; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
  EGFP, enhanced GFP; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; HEK293T,
  human embryonic kidney 293T cell line; sg, single guide.

  phosphate uptake are controlled post-transcriptionally by ESCRT.
