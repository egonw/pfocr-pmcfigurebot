caption: Antagonizing miR-18a-5p in pre-osteoblasts inhibited osteoblasts differentiation.
  Control, pre-osteoblasts with empty virus; Inhibition, pre-osteoblasts with miR-18a-5p
  inhibition. Pre-osteoblasts were MC3T3-E1 or BMSCs. (A) The expression of miR-18a-5p
  during osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E. (B, C) After 7 or 14 d of osteogenic
  induction of MC3T3-E1, the mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation marker
  genes. (D) After 14 or 21 d of osteogenic induction of BMSCs, the expression of
  osteogenic differentiation marker protein. (E) After 7 or 14 d of osteogenic induction
  of MC3T3-E1 or BMSCs, ALP staining. (F) After 21 d of osteogenic induction of MC3T3-E1
  or BMSCs, Alizarin red S staining. The data are represented as mean ± SEM or SD.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns P > 0.05.
