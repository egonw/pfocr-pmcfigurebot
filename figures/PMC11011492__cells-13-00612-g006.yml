caption: 'Co-expression of cathepsin D and gal-3 in the EAE optic nerve. Frozen cross-sections
  were stained with anti-gal-3 antibody ((A,D), red) as well as anti-cathepsin D antibody
  (a marker of phagocytotic microglia/macrophages; (B,E), green). Merged images with
  DAPI staining (blue) are shown (C,F,G). High-magnification image of inset in F is
  shown in (G). White arrowheads represent gal-3+ cells expressing cathepsin D. Representative
  data are shown. (H) Quantitative analysis of cathepsin D+/gal-3+ cells (N = 5).
  Note that about 80% of gal-3+ cells expressed cathepsin D in the EAE optic nerve
  at the peak disease stage. Scale bars: (A–C): 100 μm; (D–F): 50 µm; (G): 25 µm.'
