caption: 'KEGG prediction for pathway and functional roles of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). Functional prediction by KEGG analysis of differentially expressed
  genes in hypomethylating agent (HMA)-resistant P39 sublines compared with P39 was
  performed separately for azacitidine-resistant P39 (P39-AZA-R) and decitabine-resistant
  P39 (P39-DEC-R). This gene set analysis studied both over-expressed and under-expressed
  genes together to look for biological pathways that are implicated. Both HMA-resistant
  sublines had dysregulated PI3K/Akt signaling that were predicted to be mediated
  by platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA) and Endothelia PAS domain-containing
  protein 1 (EPAS1) upon correlation with DNA methylation patterns. Both sublines
  also showed similar dysregulation in cellular processes. The PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway (red) was functionally significant in both cell lines. The results from
  this RNA expression-based analysis support the 850 K methylome data that predicted
  PI3K (PTEN and MDM2) signaling dysregulation during HMA resistance. Rich factor:
  ratio of the DEG number and the number of genes annotated in the relevant pathway.
  The greater of the Rich factor, the greater the degree of significance of the pathway
  identified. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.'
