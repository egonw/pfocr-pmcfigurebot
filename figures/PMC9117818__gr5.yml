caption: ARID1A deletion maintainsHCC cell survival in low-glucose conditions through
  activation of the AMPK pathway. (A) Western blot analysis examining the knockdown
  efficiency of PRKAA2 and KO efficiency of ARID1A in YY-8103 cells. (B) The crystal
  violet assay examining the effects of PRKAA2 and ARID1A on colony-formation ability
  of YY-8103 cells under glucose deprivation. (C) Compound C treatment inhibits the
  AMPK signaling pathway. Cell viability of (D and E) control and ARID1A KO Huh7 and
  (F and G) YY-8103 cells treated with different doses of Compound C for 48 hours
  under low-glucose (2.5 mmol/L) or normal (25 mmol/L) condition is detected by cell
  counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Cell viability of (H) control and ARID1A knockout Huh7
  cells, (I) YY-8103 cells, and (J) MHCC97H cells treated with Compound C for 72 hours
  is examined by CCK8 assay. Data are presented as means ± SD, n = 6 biologically
  independent samples, representative of 3 independent experiments. CTRL, control;
  SCR, scramble; sgRNA, single guide RNA. ∗P<0.05,∗∗P<0.01,∗∗∗P<0.001, ns, not significant.
