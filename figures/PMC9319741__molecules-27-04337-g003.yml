caption: ERK2 inhibition promotes Z734–mediated apoptosis in MCF–7 cells. (A) ERK2
  and p53 exhibit various levels of expression in tissues and in adjacent non–tumor
  tissues. Scale bars = 50 μm. (B) The ERK2 and p53 expression levels were determined
  via Western blotting after treatment with Z734 (10 μM). (C) Western blots were performed
  to determine the effect of ERK2 knockdown on p53 expression in MCF–7 cells after
  treatment with Z734 (10 μM). (D) Caspase3 activities in shERK2 MCF–7 cells treated
  with Z734 (10 μM) were determined. (E) WT and shERK2 MCF–7 cells were treated with
  Z734 (10 μM) for 12 h followed by flow cytometry to detect cell apoptosis. (F) Western
  blots were performed to detect the effect of ERK2 knockdown on BAX/BCL–2 expression
  in MCF–7 cells after treatment with Z734 (10 μM). (G) Western blots were performed
  to detect the effect of Flag–ERK2 on p53 expression in MCF–7 cells after treatment
  with Z734 (10 μM). (H) MCF–7 cells were transfected with Flag–ERK2 and treated with
  Z734 (10 μM) for 12 h followed by flow cytometry to detect cell apoptosis. (I) Caspase3
  activities in ERK2 overexpressing MCF–7 cells treated with Z734 (10 μM) were determined.
  (J) Western blots were performed to detect the effect of overexpressing ERK2 on
  BAX/BCL–2 expression in MCF–7 cells after treatment with Z734 (10 μM). Data shown
  in (D,E,H,I) were used two–tailed Student’s t–test. All assays were performed in
  triplicate, and the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01.
