caption: 'mTOR pathway inhibition and ER stress induction in EAAm-supplemented cancer
  cells. Western blot of phospho p70S6K (p-p70S6K) (A), ATF4 (B), cleaved caspase-3
  (D) and p-eIF2 (E) levels in nuclear extracts (ATF4) and whole-cell lysates (p70S6K,
  p-eIF2 and caspase-3) of the indicated cancer cell lines incubated in culture medium
  alone (CTRL) or 200 µM rapamycin (Rapa) for 24 h (D), or supplemented with EAAm
  mixture for 3 h (EAAm). Menin was used as a nuclear loading control. (C) MTT assay
  of the viability of M14 (above) and Hela (below) cells untreated or treated with
  rapamycin alone or plus 1% EAAm with the indicated doses for 24 h. Mean (n = 4) ± SEM.
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. untreated, ###P < 0.001 vs. rapamycin, §§P < 0.01 and §§§P < 0.001
  vs. EAAm. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey''s post hoc test. (F) Left: SUnSET puromycin
  labelling immunoblot assay in triplicate samples of HeLa cells incubated with DMEM
  (CTRL) or the EAA mixture (EAAm) for 5 h. GAPDH is used as a loading control Right:
  quantification of blot signal levels. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. CTRL Unpaired Student''s t-test
  (G) mRNA expression of ER stress markers in various cancer cells left untreated
  (CTRL) or incubated for 5 h with the 1% EAAm mixture (EAAm). Mean ± SEM (n = 3)
  from at least three experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. CTRL.
  Unpaired Student''s t-test.'
