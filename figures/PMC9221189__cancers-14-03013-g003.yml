caption: Exclusive enzymes directly involved in the O-GlcNAcylation cycle. (A) The
  schematic structure of hOGT isoforms. Three hOGT variants (ncOGT, mOGT, and sOGT)
  are derived from the OGT gene located on chromosome Xq13.1 by alternative splicing
  and multiple transcription start sites. These variants possess an identical catalytic
  domain in the C-terminal region, but they have different TPR repeats involved in
  substrate recognition in the N-terminal region. ncOGT (116 kDa) has 13.5 TPR repeats,
  mOGT (103 kDa) contains 9 TPR repeats, and sOGT possesses only 2.5 TPR repeats.
  Additionally, only mOGT contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) in the
  N-terminal region. (B) The structure of human OGA (hOGA) isoforms. Two hOGA variants
  (ncOGA and sOGA) are produced from the MGEA5 gene located on chromosome 10q24.32.
  Both contain a hydrolase catalytic domain in the N-terminal region, but only ncOGA
  has a HAT-like domain and part of the stalk domain. (C) The function of OGT O-GlcNAcylation.
  O-GlcNAcylation at Ser389 of OGT promotes interaction with importin α5, leading
  to the nuclear import of OGT. O-GlcNAcylation at Ser3 and Ser4 of OGT inhibits its
  activity by competing with GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation. (D) The function of OGA
  O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation at Ser405 of OGA represses its stability and activity.
