caption: The acetyl CoA diversion pathway in secondary 3MGC acidurias. When IEMs occur
  in genes that affect mitochondrial membrane structure, ETC function or ATPase subunits,
  acetyl CoA entry to the TCA cycle slows. When this occurs, acetyl CoA is diverted
  to trans-3MGC CoA in three enzyme-mediated steps. Initially, acetoacetyl CoA thiolase
  (T2) catalyzes a Claisen condensation between two acetyl CoA, yielding acetoacetyl
  CoA and free CoA. Following this, HMG CoA synthase 2 catalyzes a second Claisen
  condensation between acetoacetyl CoA and acetyl CoA, yielding (S)-HMG CoA and free
  CoA. This intermediate is then dehydrated to trans-3MGC CoA by the leucine catabolism
  pathway enzyme, AUH.
