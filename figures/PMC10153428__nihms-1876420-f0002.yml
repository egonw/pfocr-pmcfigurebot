caption: 'Characteristics of phosphoprotein signaling and sites. (A) Venn diagram
  representing phosphosites confidently observed from PKAca- , J-PKAca-, and vector-only
  expressing cells (created using BioVenn https://www.biovenn.nl/). (B) Phosphosites
  observed (same lists used as input for IPA) were compared between the HEK293 overexpression
  models and FL-HCC tumor tissues (tumor > adj. normal, eLife, 2019). Venn diagrams
  for comparisons of individual sites and for protein identifiers were created with
  BioVenn. (C) Sequence motif analysis for the overlapping phosphosite observations
  was performed using PTM-Logo, also including motif analysis for the sites observed
  as phosphorylated by WT PKAca in a previously reported study by Sugiyama et al.
  in 2019, performing whole-protein in vitro phosphorylation. Only significantly over-represented
  amino acids and charge characteristics at positions −7 to +7 are shown in sequence
  logos. Charge logo legend: Ψ = basic residue, e.g., K/R; θ = acidic residue, e.g.,
  D/E; ϕ = hydrophobic residue; P = proline; Δ = other. (D) Heatmap generated with
  https://heatmapper.ca, illustrating selected pathway activation enrichment scores
  from IPA (), comparing phosphorylation sites observed as higher in tumor vs normal
  FL-HCC tissue in the Turnham et al. study vs HEK293 cells overexpressing J-PKAca
  or WT PKAca (after filtering each to remove sites observed in vector-only control).
  Multiple comparison-corrected Benjamini–Hochberg p-values were determined in IPA,
  with the significance cutoff set at p = 0.05, and only pathways with significant
  B–H p-value enrichment scores from the Turnham data and the J-PKAca data were included
  in the heatmap.'
