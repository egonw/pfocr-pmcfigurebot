caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis. The primary metabolism involved in
  ferroptosis can be roughly divided into three categories: iron metabolism, System
  Xcâˆ’/GSH/GPX4 pathway, and lipid peroxidation. Besides, the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway,
  which exists as an independent parallel system with GPX4 and GSH, inhibits phospholipid
  peroxidation and ferroptosis.'
