caption: Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related
  genes. (A-B) The bar plot and bubble plot of significant GO terms. (C-D) The bar
  plot and heat map of enriched KEGG pathways. (E) KEGG circle of functional enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related genes. The red circles display
  up-regulation, and the blue ones display down-regulation. The higher the Z-score
  value indicated, the higher expression of the enriched pathway. GO, Gene Ontology;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.

  profiles and immune cell infiltration signatures to reveal the prognosis of non-small
  cell lung cancer.
