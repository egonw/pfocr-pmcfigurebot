caption: CRF-R1 signaling pathway in NAc of adult rats. Measurement of NAc extracellular
  neurotransmitter levels using in vivo microdialysis, the vertical gray bars indicate
  the time of NAc local infusion of 70 mM K+-aCSF, and the horizontal black lines
  indicate the time of intra-NAc infusion of the antagonist, vehicle, or co-infusion
  of antagonist with Forskolin. (A) NAc DA levels in the presence of aCSF (blue dotted
  line; n = 9), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange dotted line; n = 9) and 10 µM of CP154,526
  + 50 µM of Forskolin (green dotted line; n = 6). DA levels were normalized to the
  average of the first 3 values for each condition and expressed as percentage. Two-way
  ANOVA revealed no effect of treatment (F (2, 21) = 3.278, p = 0.0577), a main effect
  of time (F (9, 189) = 32.31, p < 0.0001), and treatment × time interaction (F (18,
  189) = 3.246, p < 0.0001; CP154,526 vs. aCSF, **** p < 0.0001, * p = 0.0210, CP154,526
  + Forskolin vs. aCSF, n.s. p > 0.9999, Bonferroni post hoc test). (B) NAc glutamate
  levels in the presence of aCSF (blue dotted line; n = 9), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange
  dotted line; n = 9) and 10 µM of CP154,526 + 50 µM of Forskolin (green dotted line;
  n = 6). Glutamate levels were normalized to the average of the first 3 values for
  each condition and expressed as percentage. Two-way ANOVA revealed no effect of
  treatment (F (2, 21) = 2.060, p = 0.1524), a main effect of time (F (9, 189) = 9.253,
  p < 0.0001), and treatment × time interaction (F (18, 189) = 1.803, p = 0.0274;
  CP154,526 vs. aCSF, **** p < 0.0001, CP154,526 + Forskolin vs. aCSF, ** p= 0.0025,
  Bonferroni post hoc test). (C) NAc GABA levels in the presence of aCSF (blue dotted
  line; n = 9), 10 µM of CP154,526 (orange dotted line; n = 9) and 10 µM of CP154,526
  + 50 µM of Forskolin (green dotted line; n = 6). GABA levels were normalized to
  the average of the first 3 values for each condition and expressed as percentage.
  Two-way ANOVA revealed no effect of treatment (F (2, 21) = 0.03616, p = 0.9645),
  a main effect of time (F (9, 189) = 19.32, p < 0.0001), and no treatment × time
  interaction (F (18, 189) = 0.1907, p > 0.9999; CP154,526 vs. aCSF, n.s. p > 0.9999,
  CP154,526 + Forskolin vs. aCSF, n.s. p > 0.9999, Bonferroni post hoc test).
