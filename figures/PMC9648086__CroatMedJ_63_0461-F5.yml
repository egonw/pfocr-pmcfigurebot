caption: Gene expression of cancer stem cells- and apoptosis-related genes. (A) Effect
  of ornidazole on cancer stem cells marker in unsorted, CD133+, and CD133- group
  was assessed with real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (B) The expression
  levels of apoptosis genes were analyzed with RT-PCR in unsorted, CD133+ and CD133-
  groups. All groups were compared with control group. Results are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation of three independent experiments (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  correction for multiple comparisons, *** P < 0.001, n = 6/group).

  signaling pathway and inducing multiple death pathways in a mouse model.
