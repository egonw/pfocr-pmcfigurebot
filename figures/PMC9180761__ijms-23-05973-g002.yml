caption: Functional enrichment analysis and heatmap for differentially methylated
  and expressed profiles. Venn diagrams show selected genes with a negative correlation
  between methylation and gene expression in patients with adenomyosis and controls.
  Items 01–05 list the enriched biological functions of 53 lowly DMGs and highly DEGs
  as multicellular organism development, regulation of transcription, and potassium
  ion transport. Items 06–13 list the enriched biological functions of 176 highly
  DMGs and lowly DEGs as negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase
  II promoter, aorta development, osteoblast differentiation, and negative regulation
  of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; DMGs,
  differentially methylated genes.
