caption: Mechanisms of non-type 2 inflammation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis
  without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). In response to environmental stimuli, epithelial
  cells release inflammatory mediators that induce type 1 (Th1) or 17 (Th17) inflammatory
  pathways. Th1 and Th17 orchestrate inflammation through the production of IFN-Î³,
  IL-17a, and IL-22. In this pathway, B cell activation and differentiation into plasma
  cells can produce IgG antibodies that finally lead to neutrophil activation.
