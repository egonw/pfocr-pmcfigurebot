caption: 'Decreased protein synthesis upon TXNIP knockdown. (A) Gene set enrichment
  analysis plots of Gene Ontology ribosome biogenesis pathway in HSC (left) and of
  cytoplasmic translation in ST3 cells (right) upon TXNIP knockdown. NES: normalized
  enrichment score. (B) The relative expression of LTV1 and RRP15 in d3 HSC was determined
  using RT-qPCR (mean ± SEM; n = 4–5). (C) The protein synthesis rate of cells from
  TXNIP knockdown versus control cultures was analyzed using the O-propargyl puromycin
  (OPP) kit. On d3 (left) and d7 (right), cells were incubated with OPP for 30 min,
  followed by a Click-iT reaction with an Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore and flow cytometric
  quantification. The OPP mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the indicated developmental
  stages is shown (mean ± SEM; n = 8). Overlaid histograms of OPP fluorescence of
  representative samples are displayed. * and ** represent statistical significance
  compared to control transduced conditions with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively.'
