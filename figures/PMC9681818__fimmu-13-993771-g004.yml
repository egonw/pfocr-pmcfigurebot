caption: Single cell transcriptomic atlas reveals a heterogenous tumor infiltrating
  myeloid cell landscape with differential inflammasome signatures in each subtype.
  (A) tSNE plot showing the transcriptome landscape of 19,193 cells in the TME from
  patients with HNSCC (n=6). Colors indicate cell types. (B) Bubble heat map showing
  relative expression levels of typical signature genes for all cell types shown in
  panel (A). (C) tSNE showing the subtypes of 3072 myeloid cells (subset of the entire
  cell population) in the tumor excluding neutrophils, divided into 13 different subclusters.
  The “other” subset could not be characterized.”tSNE showing the phenotypic heterogeneity
