caption: The potential mechanism of PTPRT underlying cancer metastasis. PTPRT mutations
  or hypermethylation of the promoter region leads to gene dysfunction, which in turn
  affects adhesion and aggregation between cells and leads to tumor invasion/migration
  and metastasis. On the other hand, the dysfunction of PTPRT activates the STAT3
  pathway, which promotes the gene transcription and leads to cell survival, proliferation,
  migration, and metastasis.
