caption: 'Downregulated ASS1 levels are associated with high PGAM1 expression and
  worse prognosis in patients with BC. (A) Representative images of ASS1 with different
  IHC staining scores (n = 83, scale bar: 50 μm). (B) Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS
  and (C) DFS in BC patients with low and high ASS1 expression levels (n = 83). (D)
  The expression levels of PGAM1 were negatively related to the expression levels
  of ASS1 (n = 83). (E) Representative images of IHC staining of the same regions
  for PGAM1 and ASS1 (n = 83, scale bar: 50 μm). Data was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier
  method (B, C) or Spearman''s correlation (D).'
