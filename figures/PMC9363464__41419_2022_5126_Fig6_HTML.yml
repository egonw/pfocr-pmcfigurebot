figure_title: Nrf2 regulates Notch signaling in HNSCC cells
caption: A Expression of Notch1 and Notch target genes mRNA in control and Keap1-expressing
  SSC9 clone cells. B Expression of Notch1 and Hes1 proteins in Keap1-mutant and Keap1-expressing
  SSC9 cells. C Notch1 and Hes1 mRNA and, D protein expression after Nrf2 knockdown
  in SSC9 cells. E Immunohistochemistry staining and expression of Nrf2, Ki67, Notch1,
  and Hes1 in HNSCC clinical samples from wild-type, Nrf2, and Keap1 mutant patients
  tumor tissues. F Notch1 expression in non-targeting control and Notch1 siRNA-treated
  SSC9 cells G Cell proliferation of SSC9 cells after knockdown of Notch1 by siRNA.
  H Relative mRNA expression of Hes1 and Hey1 after Notch1 knockdown in SSC9 cells.
  I Hes1 mRNA expression and, J Cell proliferation after knockdown of Hes1 siRNA in
  SSC9 cells. K Effects of Notch inhibitor DAPT and, L Assessment of cell growth after
  treating the cells with Notch inhibitor DAPT for 5-days. The mRNA expression levels
  were calculated and normalized relative to GAPDH. All experiments were run in triplicate
  and compared with the control group. Data presents as mean ± SEM (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
