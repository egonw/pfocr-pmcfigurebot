caption: 'Curcumin activates the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibited by DHT in ovary GCs. Curcumin/LY294002-treated
  GCs were induced by DHT. (a–d) Round coverslips of ovarian GCs were immunostained
  for revealing p-PI3K and p-AKT expression levels (red) as indicated. The slides
  were counterstained with DAPI (blue), and the images were captured using an inverted
  fluorescence microscope. (e, f) The protein expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, and
  p-AKT in ovarian GCs was assessed with western blotting. Representative data are
  displayed, and the relative protein intensity of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT was
  normalized to GAPDH. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05 vs. DMSO group; ##p < 0.05 vs. DHT
  group.'
