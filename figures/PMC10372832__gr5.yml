caption: Photocontrol of the in vivo antifungal effects of photocaged compound A1
  in G. mellonella larvae and mouse skin infection model. (A) Schematic diagram of
  in vivo efficacy evaluation of the G. mellonella larvae. Image element created with
  BioRender.com. (B) Survival of G. mellonella treated with FLC, compound A1, and
  compound A1 combined with light, respectively, 30 min before infection of C. albicans
  SC5314 (6 × 105 CFU/larva). (C) Survival of G. mellonella treated with FLC, compound
  A1, and compound A1 combined with light, respectively, 30 min after infection of
  C. albicans SC5314 (6 × 105 CFU/larva). (D) Schematic diagram of in vivo efficacy
  evaluation of mice model of cutaneous candidiasis. Image element created with BioRender.com.
  (E) Antifungal effects of light-controlled compound A1 in a mouse skin model of
  candidiasis, which was evaluated by local fungal burden on the skin. Mice were divided
  into four groups, and treated with solvent (control group), FLC (20 mg/mL, FLC group),
  compound A1 combined with UV light (20 mg/mL, A1-hv group), and compound A1 alone
  (20 mg/mL, A1-black group), respectively. The comparison between the two groups
  was completed by the One-way ANOVA. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
