caption: High expression of AEG-1 and miR-221 with poorer prognosis in liver cancer
  patients. (A). The mRNA expression of AEG-1 showed across all TCGA tumors, T (tumor—red)
  and N (normal—blue), Wilcoxon test used for statistical significance analysis (*
  p-value < 0.05; ** p-value < 0.01; *** p-value < 0.001) by using TIMER 2.0. (B)
  AEG-1 was amplified (red) in 15% of LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma) (www.cbioportal.org)
  (accessed on 13 August 2022). (C) The AEG-1 mRNA expression was examined in normal
  (blue) (n = 50) and tumor (red) tissues (n = 371) from the cases of LIHC in the
  TCGA database using UALCAN (accessed on 13 August 2022). (D) miR-221 expression
  was examined in normal (blue) (n = 50) and tumor (orange) tissues (n = 370) from
  the cases of LIHC using the publicly available TCGA database using (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn)
  (accessed on 13 August 2022) portal. (E) The Kaplan –Meier plot shows that a lower
  expression of miR-221 is associated with better overall survival of hepatocellular
  carcinoma patients. (F) Kaplan–Meier survival curves of liver cancer patients showed
  AEG-1 expression on overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), progression-free
  survival (PFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS); the cutoff value of AEG-1 expression
  was set as its median value (accessed on 13 August 2022). (G) Pearson’s correlation
  between AEG-1 and PTEN, Akt, and PI3K expression in LIHC patients using the TCGA
  database using GEPIA 2 (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) (accessed
  on 13 August 2022).
