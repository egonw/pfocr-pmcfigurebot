figure_title: Cldn-7 promotes colonic epithelial homoeostasis and regeneration through
  the Wnt and Notch signalling pathway
caption: 'A Differential expression analysis showing the Log2 fold change values of
  stem cells and differentiated cells. B Representative GSEA enrichment plots showing
  the negatively enriched gene sets for Lgr5+ stem cells, Wnt signalling, and Notch
  signalling in Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2 mice. C Quantitative RT-PCR verification
  of Wnt signalling related genes (Axin2, β-catenin, C-myc, Wnt3, Wnt5b, Cyclind1,
  Ephb2, Fzd5, Fzd7, Tcf4, and CD44) and Notch signalling related genes (Dll1, Dll4,
  Hes1, and Notch1) in colonic tissues from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2 and Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreW
  mice treated with TAM for 5 days. n = 4–6 per genotype. D Immunostains and quantitative
  analysis of β-catenin, Notch1 and Hes1 labelling in colonic tissues from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2
  and Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreW mice treated with TAM for 5 days, scale bars: 50 μm, n = 3
  per genotype. E Immunoblot analysis showing the expression of specific proteins
  (Cldn-7, β-catenin, C-myc, and Cyclind1) in the colon from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2
  and Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreW mice treated with TAM for 5 days. β-actin was employed
  as a loading control; n = 3 per genotype. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. F Quantitative RT-PCR verification of Wnt and Notch signalling-related
  genes in colonic organoids derived from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2 mice that were
  treated with VEH or TAM (n = 3 per genotype). G Colonic organoids derived from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2
  crypts (VEH or TAM treatment) that were treated with DMSO, Chir (10 μM), Wnt3a (100 ng/mL),
  or Wnt3a+Chir for 48 h. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to detect β-catenin,
  C-myc, Cyclind1, and Wnt3 expression in these organoids (n = 3 per genotype). H
  Representative images of colonic organoids derived from Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2
  crypts (VEH or TAM treatment) were treated with DMSO, Chir (10 μM), Wnt3a (100 ng/mL),
  or Wnt3a+Chir; scale bars: 50 μm. Right panel: Quantification of average organoid
  size per organoid for Cldn-7fl/fl;Lgr5-CreERT2 with different treatments. Statistical
  data are presented as mean ± SEM. All p values were generated by Student’s t-test
  (two-tailed) or Mann–Whitney nonparametric test; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001, ns, not significant.'
