caption: The expression of hsa_circ_0087302 is decreased in osteosarcoma cells, and
  construction of the hsa_circ_0087302 overexpression model. (A) The expression of
  hsa_circ_0087302 in OS cells was lower than that in osteoblasts. (B-C) The overexpression
  model was constructed by lentiviral transduction, and the transduction efficiency
  was verified by fluorescence microscopy and RT-PCR. NC is the negative control.
  Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 3) (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001).
article_title: Hsa_circ_0087302, a circular RNA, affects the progression of osteosarcoma
