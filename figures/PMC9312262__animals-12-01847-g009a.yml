caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after overexpression
  of DGAT2. (A) KEGG enrichment factor map. (B) KEGG functional annotation of DEGs
  involved in the PPAR signaling pathway. (C) KEGG functional annotation of DEGs involved
  in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. (D) KEGG functional annotation of
  DEGs involved in the biosynthetic pathway of unsaturated fatty acids. Red rectangles
  indicate DEGs significantly upregulated (log fold change > 1, false discovery rate
  (FDR) < 0.001); green rectangles indicate DEGs significantly downregulated (log
  fold change > 1, FDR < 0.001) in BSCs infected with Ad-DGAT2 compared with control
  Ad-NC.
