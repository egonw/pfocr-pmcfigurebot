caption: 'Critical signaling pathway analysis: (A) Protein–protein interaction network
  of DEGs using the STRING database []. DEGs obtained from the microarray analysis
  were colored in dark red when down-expressed, whereas up-expressed DEGs were colored
  in dark blue. Down- and up-activated kinases obtained from the phospho-kinase array
  were depicted in light red and light blue, respectively. The MCODE tool was used
  to identify the two main protein clusters present in the protein-protein interaction
  network: Cluster 1 (22 nodes and 222 edges) (B) and Cluster 2 (17 nodes and 51 edges)
  (C).'
