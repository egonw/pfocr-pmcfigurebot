caption: 'Immunofluorescence assay showed that BA reduced the expression of α-SMA
  in LTD4-induced type II AEC cells: (a) BA reduced the expression of α-SMA in LTD4-induced
  type II AEC cells (200-fold) and (b) BA reduced the fluorescence intensity of α-SMA
  in LTD4-induced type II AEC cells. LTD4: 150 nM LTD4-induced type II AEC cells and
  BA: baicalin. Compared with the control group, ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01; compared
  with the LTD4 group, #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD
  (n = 3) and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey analysis.'
