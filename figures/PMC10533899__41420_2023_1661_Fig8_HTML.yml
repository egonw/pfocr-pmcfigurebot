figure_title: S100A2 regulates EMT and cell metastasis via SMAD4
caption: A Detection of SMAD4- and EMT-related proteins in BxPC-3 cells with S100A2
  knockdown and SMAD4 overexpression via immunoblotting. B, C As observed in the scratch-wound
  assay, SMAD4 overexpression enhanced cell invasion. D–F According to the Transwell
  assay, SMAD4 overexpression dramatically increased cell invasion and migration.
  G A proposed model underlying the role of S100A2 in the regulation of EMT and metastasis
  in PDAC. S100A2 upregulates the expression of SMAD4 through the transforming growth
  factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway, and the S100A2/SMAD4 axis modulates EMT to accelerate
  PDAC development. Every assay was performed three times. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
article_title: S100A2 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis in
  pancreatic cancer by coordinating transforming growth factor β signaling in SMAD4-dependent
  manner.
