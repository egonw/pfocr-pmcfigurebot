caption: Illustration of mechanical loading activated-Piezo1 induces opening of Cx43
  HCs via PI3K-Akt pathway. Fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) induces the activation
  of the Piezo1 Channel, increasing the intracellular Ca2+ levels, leading to an increase
  in the activity of both Cx43 HCs and Panx1 channels, allowing the release of ATP.
  Extracellular ATP activates P2X receptors promoting the entrance of Ca2+ into the
  cytoplasm, holding the activity of Cx43 HCs and Panx1 channels. Active Piezo1 Channel
  complex could lead to the activation of the AKT pathway and stabilization of active
  Cx43 HCs in the cell surface. This system could be inactivated by the action of
  extracellular phosphatases and reducing the ATP levels. The inhibition of Piezo1
  channels (Dooku1) and/or AKT pathway (LY) close Cx43 HCs
