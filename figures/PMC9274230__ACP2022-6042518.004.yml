caption: 'Compared with the control group, proteins were downregulated in the sunitinib
  group. Compared with the sunitinib group, a part of proteins were upregulated. WB
  was used to detect the protein expression of p-VEGFR, PI3K, AKT, YBX1, and snail
  of three groups and normalized to GAPDH. Compared with control group, above proteins
  were all downregulated in the sunitinib group: p-VEGFR, PI3K, AKT, YBX1, and snail,
  ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. The VEGFR group was compared with the sunitinib group: p-VEGFR,
  PI3K, AKT, and snail, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001; YBX1, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. The data in the figure
  were expressed by mean ± SD. Comparison between two groups was analyzed by t-test,
  and the experiment was repeated three times independently.'
