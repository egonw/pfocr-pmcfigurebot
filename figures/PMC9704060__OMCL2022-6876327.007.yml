caption: Schematic diagram of the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan production,
  phenylalanine metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism pathway. There are still some
  limitations existed in this study. First of all, we only included 30 BEB patients
  in our study, and the limited number of BEB patients might not be sufficient to
  identify the altered metabolic status of BEB patients. So, a larger sample size
  of BEB patients and cohort are needed to validate our results. Moreover, there is
  currently a lack of animal and cell models for blepharospasm, so animal and cell-level
  validation cannot be performed. We have found 134 differential nontargeted metabolites
  and predicted the possible involvement of signaling pathways of the changed nontargeted
  metabolites. However, the relationship between these metabolites and BEB is required
  to be further investigated.
