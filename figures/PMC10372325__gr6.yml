caption: Transcription factor-protein-protein interaction networks (TF-PPI) key pathway
  modulators in diabetes. A network of significantly modulated TF-PPIs for intact
  (A) and injured vessels at different timepoints - 20 hours (B), 2 weeks (C), and
  6 weeks (D). Significantly up- and down-regulated genes from each timepoint comparing
  Goto-Kakizaki (GK) vs Wistar rats, were used to obtain TF-PPI, and this information
  was fed into STRING database to generate the network. The top 10 up- and 10 down-regulated
  TFs are shown in the network above. Up- and down-regulated TFs are indicated in
  green and red nodes respectively. Size of the nodes indicate the levels of P-value.
  All the interactions were predicted with the adjusted P-value < .05.
article_title: Transcriptomic and physiological analyses reveal temporal changes contributing
  to the delayed healing response to arterial injury in diabetic rats.
