caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment among serum metabolites. (A) Counts of significantly
  variable metabolites from each metabolic superpathway. Each bar represents the number
  of significantly variable metabolites in each superpathway. The red bars show the
  number of metabolites that were increased in dogs with EPI compared with healthy
  controls. The blue bars show the number of metabolites that were decreased in dogs
  with EPI compared with healthy controls. (B) Metabolite set enrichment analysis
  of metabolic subpathways (MSEA). MSEA was used to detect metabolic subpathways enriched
  among metabolites with high (positive NES) and low (negative NES) stability. The
  20 subpathways with the highest absolute value of NES are shown. Bars are annotated
  using the FDR-adjusted p-value (q-value), such that grey bars represent pathways
  with q-value â‰¥ 0.2 and orange bars represent subpathways with q-value < 0.2.
