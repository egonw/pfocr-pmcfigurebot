caption: Effects of CRHF2 on PM-induced alterations in survival rate and heart beat
  rate of zebrafish. (a) survival rate, (b) heartbeat rate. Experiments were triplicated
  (n = 3). Results are represented as mean Â± SD; ** p < 0.01. (# denotes significance
  compared to control while * represents significance compared to PM treated group
  0 (+)).
