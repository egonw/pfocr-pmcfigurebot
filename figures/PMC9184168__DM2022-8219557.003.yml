caption: GO and KEGG analyses of the predicted target genes of miR-144-3p. The functions
  of these target genes are described in-depth at three levels by GO analysis including
  cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes (a). KEGG pathway
  analysis of genes targeted to miR-144-3p (b). There was three macromolecule-related
  macromolecule process (red) in the biological process of GO analysis.
