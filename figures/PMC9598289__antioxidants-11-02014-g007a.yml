caption: The Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway is associated with the antioxidant activity
  of 9r. (A) Compound 9r increased nuclear Nrf2 levels as well as the expression of
  the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzyme HO-1. (B–D) Grey intensity analysis of Nrf2
  and HO-1. (E) Analysis of Nrf2 immunofluorescence labeling using red Nrf2 and blue
  diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence microscopy was used to view the images.
  Data are provided as the mean standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  Compared to the given control group, ** p < 0.01. Compared to the H2O2−treated group,
  &&p < 0.01 and &&&p < 0.001.
