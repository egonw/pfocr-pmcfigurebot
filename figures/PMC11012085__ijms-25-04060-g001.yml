caption: CDK2, 4 and 6 immunohistochemical expression in ovarian cancers. (A) CDK2
  protein expression in ovarian cancer (panel on the left side of figure shows negative
  CDK2 expression, and the panel on the right side shows moderate to strong CDK2 expression).
  (B) Kaplan–Meier curve for CDK2 nuclear expression and progression-free survival
  (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression). (C) Kaplan–Meier curve
  for CDK2 nuclear expression and overall survival (blue line = low expression, green
  line = high expression). (D) CDK4 protein expression in ovarian cancer (panel on
  the left side of figure shows negative CDK4 expression, and the panel on the right
  side shows moderate to strong CDK4 expression). (E) Kaplan–Meier curve for CDK4
  nuclear expression and progression-free survival (blue line = low expression, green
  line = high expression). (F) Kaplan–Meier curve for CDK4 nuclear expression and
  overall survival (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression). (G)
  CDK6 protein expression in ovarian cancer (panel on the left side of figure shows
  negative CDK6 expression, and the panel on the right side shows moderate to strong
  CDK6 expression). (H) Kaplan–Meier curve for CDK6 nuclear expression and progression-free
  survival (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression). (I) Kaplan–Meier
  curve for CDK6 nuclear expression and overall survival (blue line = low expression,
  green line = high expression).
