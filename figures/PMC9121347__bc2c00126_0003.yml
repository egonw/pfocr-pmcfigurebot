caption: 'NOTA-insulin stimulates the insulin signaling pathway in polarized BBB endothelial
  cell monolayers similar to Humulin. Western blots were performed to assess the expression
  and phosphorylation of insulin signaling kinases in hCMEC/D3 monolayers following
  20 min treatment with or without 100 nM of (A) NOTA-insulin or (B) Humulin. Representative
  immunoblots and bar charts of the p-AKT/AKT ratio are shown (mean ± standard deviation,
  SD; n = 3: NOTA-insulin, and n = 6 Humulin). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005; unpaired
  Student’s t-tests.'
