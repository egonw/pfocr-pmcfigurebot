figure_title: GSH blocks the upregulation of ROS/TGFβ/SMAD signalling induced by LOsG
  in vivo
caption: Representative images of ROS staining and quantification of ROS staining
  in islet (A, B) and acinar (C, D) tissues. The islets are circled by a dotted line
  (levels are relative to those in sham rats, n = 5–6/group). E–J Western blot data
  of pancreatic TGFβ1, SMAD4, p-SMAD3, and SMAD3 (levels are relative to those in
  sham rats, n = 6/group). Correlations between fibrosis and islet ROS (K) or acinar
  ROS (L, n = 12). Correlations between the fibronectin protein level and TGF-β1 (M)
  or p-SMAD3 (N) or SMAD4 (O) protein levels were analysed using Pearson’s correlation
  test (n = 12). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
