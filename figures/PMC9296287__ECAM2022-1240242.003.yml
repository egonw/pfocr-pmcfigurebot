caption: 'XCH treatment modulated the serum metabolites in viral pneumonia model mice
  induced by poly (I:C). (a) Scores plots of PCA among each group. ((b) and (c)) Scores
  plots of PLS-DA between the control and model groups and the corresponding coefficient
  of loading plots. ((d) and (e)) Scores plots of PLS-DA between the model and XCH
  high-dose groups and the corresponding coefficient of loading plots. ((f) and (g))
  Summary of pathway analysis of serum samples between control and model groups (f)
  and between model and XCH high-dose groups (g); the same pathways were written in
  red. a: tyrosine metabolism; b: amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; c:
  starch and sucrose metabolism; d: arginine and proline metabolism; e: steroid hormone
  biosynthesis; f: taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; g: biotin metabolism. Control,
  model, and XCH high-dose groups (n = 6 per group).'
