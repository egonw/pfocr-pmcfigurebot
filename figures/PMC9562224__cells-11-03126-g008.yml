caption: The effect of CPP on related genes after knocking down HEY1. After knocking
  down HEY1 (siHEY1-1:40 nM), HDFs were treated with CPP (10 μM) for 6 days, and then
  the levels of vascular endothelial cell-related genes (CD31, CD133, CDH5, vWF, eNOS
  and ANGPT1) (a–f), and HDFs-related genes (Vimentin, Collagen 1, FAP, ATA2 and FSP1)
  (g–k), and HEY1 (l), were analyzed by qPCR. Data are presented as means ± SEM, *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n = 3.
