figure_title: Overview of the DNA damage signaling pathway
caption: Upon DNA damage, DSBs (DNA double-strand breaks) are sensed by the MRN complex
  and ATM homodimer. ATM is activated by autophosphorylation at S1981 and phosphorylates
  histone H2AX at S139. Phosphorylated H2AX, called γH2AX, recruits MDC1 and further
  propagates γH2AX signaling at DSB sites. MDC1 is phosphorylated by ATM, and phosphorylated
  MDC1 recruits the ubiquitin ligase RNF8. The RNF8-UBC13 complex promotes K63-linked
  polyubiquitination of H1, which is recognized by RNF168. RNF168 initially monoubiquitinates
  H2A at K13/15 and amplifies polyubiquitin chains. K13/15-monoubiquitinated H2A and
  H4K20me2 are recognized by 53BP1 and further recruit RIF1 and the Shieldin complex
  to promote NHEJ repair. Alternatively, the RNF168-mediated polyubiquitin chain also
  recruits RAP80 and the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, further promoting HR repair.
