caption: 'MYCL silencing promotes the apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of
  triple-negative breast cancer cells. Protein expression levels of MYCL in (A) MDA-MB-453
  cells transfected with MYCL siRNAs and (B) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL
  were detected by western blotting. Apoptosis of (C) MDA-MB-453 cells transfected
  with MYCL siRNAs and (D) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL was detected
  by flow cytometry. Colony formation was used to detect the effect of (E) MYCL silencing
  on MDA-MB-453 cell proliferation and (F) MYCL overexpression on MDA-MB-231 cell
  proliferation (scale bar, 500 Âµm). *P<0.05 vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. NC, negative
  control; si/siRNA, small interfering RNA; MYCL, MYCL proto-oncogene.'
