caption: Effects of nutraceuticals on the growth of MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 and MIA-PaCa-2
  + pLXSN cells. The effects of genistein (A), and daidzein (B), on MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN
  cells (solid red squared) and MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 cells (solid blue circles) were
  examined by MTT analysis. The MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53, and MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells
  in each panel were all examined at the same time period. These experiments were
  repeated and similar results were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed
  by the T test on the means and standard deviations of various treatment groups.
  ***P < 0.0001.
