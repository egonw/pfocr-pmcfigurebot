caption: Pathway analysis of switch genes from asymptomatic males with Alzheimer’s
  disease (M-asymAD). (A) Biological and functional analysis of switch genes from
  M-asymAD compared to controls was performed in NetworkAnalyst. Switch genes are
  depicted in red. (B) The pathways are ranked according to the number of hits and
  lowest value of p. Pathways are derived from the KEGG database. The unique pathways
  are shown in red.
