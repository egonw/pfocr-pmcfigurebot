figure_title: The broad trafficking inhibitor Monensin affects the egress from the
  Golgi of WT IFITM3, but not of the 85-90 mutant
caption: 'Cells expressing the indicated IFITM3 protein were either treated or untreated
  with Monensin for 3 h at 0.2 mM, before confocal microscopy analysis. Panels present
  typical staining, whereas the graph presents the proportion of IFITM3 in the Golgi
  as an IFITM3 Golgi/cytoplasmic ratio (AVG = lines and individual values displayed
  as dots). The lower table presents the result of the indicated statistical analyses:
  ns, nonsignificant; **P-values â‰¤ 0.006. Source data are provided in the relevant
  section.'
article_title: A novel domain within the CIL regulates egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
