caption: Expression of taste receptor signaling pathway in human and mice gingiva
  tissue and cells. Using the NCBI RNA-seq database, we found expression of taste
  markers in 22 RNA-seq studies (with GSE numbers) from 2004 to 2021 that included
  oral tissue or cells from humans (18) and mice (4). Two more studies showing the
  expression of the taste receptor signaling pathway by reverse transcription polymerase
  chain reaction are also included here to confirm the expression of the taste receptor
  signaling pathway in human () and mouse () gingiva tissue.
