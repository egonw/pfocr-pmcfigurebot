caption: 'Neddylation-mediated breast cancer progression depends on HER2 level. A
  504 genes were significantly identified which associated with NEDD8 and ErbB2 in
  the LinkedOmics web application (http://www.linkedomics.org). B The KEGG pathway
  enrichment of genes. C ErbB2 signaling pathway associated with NEDD8 was showed.
  BT474 cells were treated with (D) His-tagged NEDD8 and (F) FLAG-tagged HER2 for
  EdU staining assay. E, G The EdU stained cells was calculated. H Proteins were extracted
  using western blot analysis to test protein expression. Cells were treated with
  MLN4924 and FLAG-HER2, subjected to (I,J) flow cytometry and (K) western blot analysis.
