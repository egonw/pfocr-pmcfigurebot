caption: 'Identification of DEGs by pathway analysis in H9c2 cells with Pcsk6 knockdown.
  (A) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs in signaling pathways. Y-axis denotes pathway
  and X-axis denotes rich ratio. The 20 most significantly changed pathways are shown.
  The targeted pathway in the study is highlighted with red color. The color intensity
  and size of bubbles indicate Q value and number of genes, respectively. (B) A heat
  map for DEGs in siPcsk6-transfected H9c2 cells. The 7 most significant DEGs in the
  protein processing in the ER pathway. Red and blue colors represent up- and down-regulated
  genes, respectively. (C) qPCR analysis of Ddit3 mRNA expression in siPcsk6-transfected
  H9c2 cells. (D) Immunofluorescent staining for DDIT3 (green) and nuclei (blue) in
  siPcsk6-transfected H9c2 cells. Scale bar: 40 µm. Percentages of DDIT3 positive
  cells were calculated. Data are mean ± S.D. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control.
  (E) DDIT3 protein levels in hearts from young (3 months, n = 3) and aged (24 months,
  n = 3) mice were assessed by densitometric quantification of Western blots. Values
  are mean ± S.D. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. Young.'
