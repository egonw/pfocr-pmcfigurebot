caption: 'SPD restrains ferroptosis via inhibiting ERK1/2–HO-1 pathway. Cardiomyocytes
  were treated with HG, SPD, Pannexin-1–siRNA, A-438079, LY3214996, Fer-1 and underwent
  the following detections: (A) The ERK1/2 signaling pathway related protein expression
  was determined by western blot; (B) The expression of HO-1, NCOA-4, and FTH-1 were
  evaluated by western blot; (C) Intracellular lipid ROS was stained by BODIPY probe;
  (D) Iron content level of cardiomyocytes; (E) Schematic diagram showing the mechanism
  of SPD alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy. *P < 0.05 vs Control group; #P < 0.05
  vs HG group (n ≥ 3). SPD: Spermidine; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; HG: High glucose;
  HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1; NCOA-4: Nuclear receptor coactivator 4; FTH-1: Ferritin
  light chain 1.'

  reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and Pannexin-1-mediated ferroptosis.
