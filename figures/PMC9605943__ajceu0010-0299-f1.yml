caption: Enzalutamide resistant MDVR cells display lineage plastic characteristics.
  A. GSEA analysis of C4-2B cells treated with enzalutamide (20 μM) for 48 hours shows
  decrease of AR signaling in enzalutamide treated cells. B. Relative quantification
  of mRNA expression by qPCR of AR target genes in C4-2B cells treated with enzalutamide
  (20 µM) for 48 hours shows decreased AR transcriptional activity. C. GSEA analysis
  showing enhancement of Wnt biogenesis and trafficking in C4-2B cells treated with
  enzalutamide (20 µM) for 48 hours. Heatmap represents most upregulated genes in
  the set by fold change relative to vehicle (DMSO) treated control cells. D. GSEA
  comparing MDVR cells to parental C4-2B cells suggests downregulation of canonical
  AR signaling in MDVR cells. E. qPCR of AR target genes in C4-2B and MDVR shows lack
  of expected increase in AR pathway activity in MDVR cells despite AR expression.
  F. GSEA shows enrichment of Wnt ligand biogenesis and trafficking in MDVR cells
  compared to C4-2B cells. G. Relative mRNA expression analysis by qPCR of WLS between
  MDVR and C4-2B cells. *p-value ≤ 0.05.
