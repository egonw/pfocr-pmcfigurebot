caption: Crystal structure of BMPs and receptors. (a) Architecture of the interaction
  of BMP-2 and ALK-3. Stereoview of the structure of the BMP-2 (green and magenta)
  and ALK-3 (blue and pink) complex. BCSB.org; PDB ID code 1 REW (adapted with permission
  from Keller et al., 2004; ref. []). (b) The ternary complex of BMP-2–ALK-3 ECD–ActRII-ECD
  displays a butterfly-like conformation. BMP-2 dimer subunits are shown in red and
  orange; the two ALK-3-ECDs are indicated in light blue and blue, and the ActR-II-ECDs
  are shown in light green and green. BCSB.org; PDB ID code 2GOO (adapted with permission
  from Allendorph et al., 2006, ref. []). (c) The crystal structure of the BMP-2 and
  RGMb complex. Cartoon representation of the BMP-2 and RGMbND complex. BMP2 is shown
  in blue and magenta; RGMCND is shown in blue. RCSB.org; PDB ID code 4UHY (adapted
  with permission from Healey et al., 2015; ref. []).
