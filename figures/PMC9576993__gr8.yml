caption: The CRISPR encapsulated in nanolipogel (tNLG)-targeted silencing of lipocalin
  2 (LCN2) gene significantly attenuated TNBC tumour growth. (a) Overexpression of
  LCN2 oncogene in human TNBC cells. (b) Schematic representation of 20 nucleotides
  (nt) sequences of sgRNA-bearing plasmids along with surface modification and targeting
  components. (c) NP@CRISPR intervenors injection can be effectively engineered the
  TNBC genome in vivo. (d) Proposed tNLG complex can cross the endothelial barrier.
  (e) The CRISPR-bearing plasmids were directly delivered into the TNBC cells cytosol
  through ICAM1-direacted plasma membrane pathway. (f) TEM images of tNLG and tNLP
  (nanoliposome without a hydrogel core). (g) Encapsulation efficacy of prepared lipid-based
  nanoparticles and commercial control coupled with CRISPR plasmids. (h–i) in vitro
  LCN2 silencing efficacy was shown in distinct TNBC cell lines. (j) Protein expression
  profile before and after LCN2-CRISPR knockout was detected by IF staining. (k) Images
  of transwell migration analysis of MDA-MB-231 ​cells together with NP@CRISPR targeted
  LCN2 knockout. (l) Image of excised tumour at 48 days from female nude mice (n ​= ​5)
  treated with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), tNLG-SCR (tumour-targeted nanolipogel
  encapsulated scramble CRISPR plasmid), nNLG-LCN2 KO (IgG conjugated nonspecific
  nanolipogel-lipocalin 2 knockout), and tNLG-LCN2 KO (ICAM1 antibody-conjugated tumour-targeted
  nanolipogel-lipocalin 2 knockout) at various time with 1 ​mg plasmid/kg MDA-MB-231 ​cells
  bearing mice. (m) tNLG-based genome engineering efficacy was measured by qRT-PCR.
  (n) Weekly tumour progression measured as the volume of tumour. (o) Weight of tumour
  mass at 84 days. Reproduced by the permission of PNAS [].
