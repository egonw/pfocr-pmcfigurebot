caption: 'TMAO increased the expression of osteoclast genes and NF-κB signaling in
  mice. (A) Representative Western blot bands of NF-κB p65, c-Fos and NFATc1 relative
  to β-actin. (B) The expression of NF-κB p65 in the TMAO group was significantly
  increased compared to the control group (n = 3 per group). (C) Representative femur
  section images of immunohistochemical staining of p65 from mice of control and TMAO
  groups. Scale = 5 μm. (D) TMAO significantly promoted average optical density (AOD)
  of p65. (E) TMAO significantly promoted C-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression in bone
  marrow examined by real-time PCR in vivo (n = 3 per group). (F) TMAO significantly
  promoted C-Fos and NFATc1 protein expression in bone marrow examined by Western
  blot in vivo (n = 3 per group). * p < 0.05, #p < 0.01.'
