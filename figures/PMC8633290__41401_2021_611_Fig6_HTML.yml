caption: In cultured human endothelial cells, miR-17-3p was upregulated by the bacterial
  endotoxin LPS, and the upregulation was associated with reduced LPS-induced production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6), chemokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) and adhesion molecules
  (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin), and recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to endothelial
  cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of miR-17-3p involves the inhibition of NF-κB
  signaling pathway activation (as demonstrated by reduced p65 nucleus translocation
  and phosphorylation of IκBα and p65) via directly targeting NIBP
article_title: MicroRNA-17-3p suppresses NF-κB-mediated endothelial inflammation by
  targeting NIK and IKKβ binding protein.
