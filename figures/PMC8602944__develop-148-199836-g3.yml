caption: The response of wild-type and mutant sperm to extracellular zinc. (A) A genetic
  model of the spe-8 pathway of sperm activation. Bars indicate negative regulation
  and arrow indicates positive regulation. (B) him-5(e1490) mutant sperm with a wild-type
  copy of zipt-7.1, and zipt-7.1(ok971); him-5(e1490) mutant sperm were dissected
  from males and treated with extracellular zinc. Values indicate mean±s.d. of the
  percentage of sperm displaying activation based on morphology (n=3 biological replicates
  with ≥100 sperm per sample) (*P<0.05; **P<0.01) (C) Wild-type (WT) and spe-8(hc50)
  mutant sperm analyzed as described for B. (D) Model of extracellular zinc-induced
  sperm activation. Extracellular zinc enters the cytosol through the ZIPT-7.1 transporter
  (blue) or unidentified transporter(s) (purple). A high concentration of cytosolic
  zinc triggers activation. spe-8 functions upstream and positively regulates these
  transporters (arrows).
