caption: Strawberry fruit structure and a model illustrating the regulatory pathway
  during fruit initiation and growth. A Double fertilization promotes biosynthesis
  of auxin and GA in the seed. Auxin and GA can stimulate receptacle development after
  being transported to the receptacle. B A diagram of receptacle illustrating the
  regulatory mechanism of fruit set. FveRGA1 is shown as a central player. The red
  lines indicate regulatory actions post-fertilization. Positive (arrows) or negative
  (bar) regulations are indicated. Adapted from (Feng et al. ; Zhou et al. ; Guo et
  al. )
