caption: (A) Binding network of PMs as nodes for BS. Simple nodes are empty circles;
  hubs are blue full circle plates. Edges are black lines, and backbone edges are
  highlighted as blue lines. (B) A suggested binding pathway of BS, see also . The
  myosin protein is shown as a grey cartoon. ADP molecule is shown with grey all-atom
  representation sticks. PMs are shown as blue spheres, and their movement is highlighted
  with orange arrows. The experimental binding mode (D, superimposed from PDB 1yv3)
  is shown with grey sticks.
