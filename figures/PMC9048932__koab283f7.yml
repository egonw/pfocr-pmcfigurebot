caption: 'The los2 mutants have altered primary metabolite homeostasis. A, Absolute
  content of sucrose, glucose, fructose, galactose, and malic acid as well as relative
  peak area of citric acid and maltose in Col-0, los2-5 and los2-2 measured by GC–MS.
  The relative amount of citric acid and maltose was calculated in respect to the
  amount of internal control in the samples and values were normalized to Col-0. B,
  Absolute content of sucrose, glucose, and malic acid as well as the relative peak
  area of citric acid in Col-0, los2-2, pad4-1 and los2-2 pad4-1 measured by GC–MS.
  The relative amount of citric acid was calculated in respect to the amount of internal
  control in the samples and values were normalized to Col-0. C, Relative peak area
  of glycolytic metabolites in Col-0, los2-2 and los2-2 pad4-1 measured by HPLC. The
  value of Col-0 WT was set as “1” and the value of others was normalized to the value
  of Col-0. D, Simplified schematic presentation of the connection between glycolysis
  and other major primary metabolic pathways. Glycolysis pathway was colored light
  gray in the background. Solid arrows indicate one single biochemical reaction while
  dashed arrows represent multiple biochemical reactions. Metabolites increased or
  decreased in the los2-2 mutant as compared to WT were colored red or blue, respectively;
  metabolites having comparable amount in the los2-2 mutant and WT were colored mocha.
  Pathways that were enriched in the GO term analysis of downregulated genes in los2-5
  mutant () were boxed or cycled with blue. Metabolites that were not dependent on
  functional PAD4 were underlined. Five biological replicates were performed for (A),
  (B), and (C). Error bars represent sd. Different letters indicate significant difference
  tested by one-way ANOVA/Duncan’s multiple range test via R 3.6.3 with “agricolae”
  package, P < 0.05. “n.s.” indicates no significant difference tested by Student
  t test, P < 0.05. FW, fresh weight. TCA cycle: The tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
