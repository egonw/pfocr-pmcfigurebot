figure_title: Cell cycle control genes and genes encoding components of the Wnt/b-catenin
  signaling pathway are downregulated during metamorphosis
caption: 'A. Shown are the mean+SEM (n = 3/NF developmental stage) of RNA-seq count
  data (top) and RTqPCR data (bottom; n = 5/NF developmental stage) for four cell
  cycle control genes: Cyclin b1—ccnb1.2; cyclin a2—ccna2; cyclin-dependent kinase
  1—cdk1; E2F transcription factor—e2f1. B. KEGG pathway analysis of RNA-seq data
  for gene expression changes during metamorphosis in X. tropicalis tadpole brain.
  Shown is the cell cycle control pathway. C. Shown are the mean+SEM (n = 3/NF developmental
  stage) of RNA-seq count data for 4 genes: Wnt family member 1—wnt1; Wnt family member
  3—wnt3; frizzled class receptor 2—fzd2; frizzled class receptor 10—fzd10.'
