figure_title: Myo1b mediates autophagy process by blocking autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion
caption: A GSEA based on GEO dataset (GSE106582) indicated autophagy-related pathway
  was enriched in adjacent mucosa tissues when compared with colorectal cancer. B,
  C Western blot analyses of Myo1b, p-mTOR, P62 and LC3 in the CRC cells silencing
  or overexpressing Myo1b were performed in the presence or absence of Chloroquine
  (50 μM, 6 h). D Intensity of MAP1LC3 punctate in HCT-8 cells was analyzed after
  transfected with Myo1b over-expression vector or cultured with RAPA (500 nM, 24 h)
  and CQ (50 μM, 6 h).
article_title: Myo1b promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis by inhibiting autophagic
  degradation of HIF-1α in colorectal cancer.
