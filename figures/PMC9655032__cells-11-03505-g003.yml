caption: 'MK-2206 attenuated renal injury and reduced inflammatory factors. (A) H&E
  staining and Masson staining were performed to examine the extent of renal injury
  and collagen fiber deposition in each group of mice, respectively (scale bar: 100
  μm). (B–D) mRNA levels of inflammatory factors TGF-β1, IL-1β, and IL-6 were detected
  by real-time PCR in each group of mice. (E,F) mRNA levels of Collagen I and Fibronectin
  in HK-2 cells treated by different concentrations of MK-2206 were detected by real-time
  PCR. The levels of mRNA expression were normalized with GADPH. ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001. MU: UUO + MK-2206.'
