caption: Regulation of the functions of MRC-5 cells by IL-10/IL-10R1. Expression of
  (A) IL-10R1 mRNA and (B) protein in MRC-5 cells in NC group (untreated cells), serum
  group (incubation with IPF serum), and serum+IL-10 antibody group (incubation with
  IPF serum and IL-10 antibody). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to
  determine mRNA expression, while Western blotting was employed to determine protein
  expression. *P<0.05 compared with NC group. (C) Expression of IL-10R1 protein in
  MRC-5 cells transfected with siR-negative control (siR-NC) or siR-IL-10R1. Western
  blotting was employed to determine protein expression. *P<0.05 compared with siR-NC
  group. (D) Viability of MRC-5 cells transfected with siR-NC or siR-IL-10R1. CCK-8
  assay was employed to determine viability. *P<0.05 compared with siR-NC group. (E)
  Cell cycle of MRC-5 cells transfected with siR-NC or siR-IL-10R1. Flow cytometry
  was employed to determine cell cycle. *P<0.05 compared with siR-NC group. (F) Expression
  of COL1a1 and COL1a2 proteins in MRC-5 cells transfected with siR-NC or siR-IL-10R1.
  Western blotting was used to determine protein expression. *P<0.05 compared with
  siR-NC group. IL-10R1, IL-10 receptor 1; si, small interfering; NC, negative control;
  COL1a1, collagen type I α 1 chain; COL1a2, collagen type I α2 chain.
