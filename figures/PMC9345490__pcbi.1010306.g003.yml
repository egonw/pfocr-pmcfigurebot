figure_title: Time evolution of pattern formation in the multicellular system
caption: (a) The percent of correct contacts over time for individual simulations
  with white noise amplitudes (σwhite = 0, 500, 1300, and 2000). The gray region shows
  the typical timescale of Notch equilibration and cell cycle. The systems start from
  randomized initial conditions and relax towards more ordered patterns within the
  first 10−102 hr (i.e., Notch equilibration). Afterwards, the stochastic fluctuations
  dominate, leading to a separation in the order of systems based on noise amplitude.
  (b) Same as (a) but for corresponding shot noise levels (σshot = 0, 5, 13, and 20).

  in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway.
