caption: The ASFV I10L protein inhibits the phosphorylation of IKKβ by reducing the
  K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. (A) The ASFV pI10L inhibits the TNF-α-triggered
  phosphorylation of IKKβ. HEK293T cells were transfected with either the pRK (Vec)
  or the pFlag-pI10L plasmid. The cells were then treated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for
  5, 10, 20, or 40 minutes, followed by immunoblotting analysis. Densitometric analysis
  of protein expression level was performed with ImageJ software. (B) The ASFV pI10L
  inhibits the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. HEK293T cells were transfected with
  the plasmids expressing HA-K63O, Myc-NEMO, or Flag-pI10L, followed by co-IP and
  immunoblotting analysis. (C) ASFVΔI10L promotes the phosphorylation of IKKβ. The
  primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were left uninfected or infected with
  ASFVWT or ASFVΔI10L (MOI = 3) for 24 hours, after which the cells were treated or
  untreated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 10 or 20 minutes and immunoblotting analysis
  was performed. Densitometric analysis of protein expression levels were performed
  with ImageJ software. (D) ASFVΔI10L enhances the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO.
  PAMs were left uninfected or infected with ASFVWT or ASFVΔI10L (MOI = 3) for 24
  hours, and the cells were then treated or untreated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 20
  minutes, after which co-IP and immunoblotting analysis were performed. Densitometric
  analysis of protein expression levels were performed with ImageJ software. Data
  shown are the mean ± SD from one representative experiment performed in triplicates.
