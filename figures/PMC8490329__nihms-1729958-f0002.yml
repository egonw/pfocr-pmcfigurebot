caption: Class-specific mixtures of urinary phenol, phthalate, or organophosphate
  ester (OPE) biomarkers associated with increased (red connection) or decreased (blue
  connection) concentrations of plasma oxylipins among pregnant women (n = 89).,1
  Associations estimated by quantile g-computation models fit separately for each
  chemical class mixture and adjusted for gestational age at sampling and maternal
  age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, education, and delivery year. Red and blue
  connections in the chord diagram represent statistically significant positive and
  negative associations (i.e., p-Value<0.05), respectively. Statistically null associations
  (i.e., p<0.05) are left blank.2 Oxylipins are grouped by biosynthetic pathway, including
  fatty acid precursor (i.e., linoleic acid [LA], arachidonic acid [AA], docosahexaenoic
  acid [DHA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) and enzyme group (i.e., cytochrome P450
  [CYP], lipoxygenase [LOX], and cyclooxygenase [COX])
