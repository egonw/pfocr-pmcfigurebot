caption: 'Effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on the NF-κB signaling pathway in IL-1β-induced
  NP cells. The relative expression of NF-κB p-p65 and IκK detected by Western blot.
  Data were presented as mean ± SD of at least three repeated experiments. *p < 0.05,
  vs control group; #p < 0.05, vs IL-1β group.'
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 relieves rat intervertebral disc degeneration and inhibits
  IL-1β-induced nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
