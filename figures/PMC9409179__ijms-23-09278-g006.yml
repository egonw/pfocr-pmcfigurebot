caption: 'Suggested mechanism by which FMR1 inactivation regulates the impaired functional
  connectivity underlying Fragile X syndrome. (A) Neurons were plated, measured, and
  analyzed by multielectrode array recordings and data analyses were performed as
  previously described in Gildin et al., 2022 []. These heatmaps summarize cross-correlation
  among all multielectrode array active electrodes (≥15 spikes/min) of WT (top) and
  FX (bottom) derived neurons at 44 DIV (left) and 51 DIV (right). The panel ranges
  from high synchrony/high cross-correlation among neurons (red), to low synchrony/low
  cross-correlation (blue). Diagonal red patterns stand for autocorrelation within
  the recorded neurons. (B) Schematic presentation of the suggested molecular pathway
  regulating aberrant function in FXS. In control neurons, FMRP is important for the
  regulation of BMP signaling pathways and ECM molecules expression: these in turn
  control proper neurite outgrowth. Together with the formation of normal neuronal
  network activity, learning and memory abilities are generated. In contrast, in FX-derived
  neurons, FMRP is not expressed, leading to altered expression of BMP and ECM signaling
  pathways and resulting in reduced neurite outgrowth. Eventually, with the hyperexcitable
  and less synchronous neuronal networks, intellectual disability is formed.'
