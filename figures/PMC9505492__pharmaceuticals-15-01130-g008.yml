caption: 'Mechanism of the protective effect of MgIG on HRZE-induced liver injury:
  MgIG alleviated HRZE-induced disruption in gut microbiota and damage of tight junction
  structures, then reduced LPS entry into the blood, inhibited the liver TLRs/NF-κB
  pathway and subsequent inflammatory response. Supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus
  JYLR-005 alleviated HRZE-induced liver injury to a certain extent.'
