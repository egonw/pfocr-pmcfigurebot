caption: Quercitrin potentiates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (a) Reporter
  gene assay in RKO B/R cells treated with L-cell CM, Wnt3a CM or recombinant human
  Wnt3a. The cells were treated with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or quercitrin
  for 24 h (n = 3, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean
  ± SD. (b) TOPFLASH reporter gene assay in transfected HEK293T cells treated with
  L-cell CM or Wnt3a CM. The cells were treated with the vehicle DMSO or quercitrin
  for 24 h (n = 3, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (c) Reporter
  gene assay of RKO B/R cells treated for 6 h (n = 3, performed in triplicate, one-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, *** p < 0.001). Error bars
  denote mean ± SD. (d) Reporter gene assay of RKO B/R cells treated for 12 h (n =
  3, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (e) Immunoblot assay of RKO cells
  lysate after 4 h treatment. RKO cells were treated with L-cell CM (lane 1) or Wnt3a
  CM (lanes 2–4). (f) Densitometric analysis of (e) showing that quercitrin increases
  β-catenin protein levels (n = 4, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (g) Immunoblotting of RKO cells
  treated for 24 h. RKO cells were treated with L-cell CM (lane 1) or Wnt3a CM (lanes
  2–4). (h) Densitometric analysis of (g) pLRP6/LRP6 protein levels revealing that
  quercitrin increases pLRP6 S1490 and decreases pβ-catenin S33/S37 protein levels
  (n = 4, performed in triplicate, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD. (i) Densitometric
  analysis of (g) pβ-catenin/β-catenin protein levels revealing that quercitrin decreases
  pβ-catenin S33/S37 protein levels (n = 4, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons test, *** p < 0.001). Error bars denote mean ± SD.
