caption: cEVs are enriched for oncometabolites and molecules which alter tRNA aminoacylation
  in treated normal pancreas cells. (a) Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified
  significant dysregulation in metabolites related to citrulline biosynthetic pathways
  and tRNA charging in cEVs compared to nEVs. FDR‐adjusted p < 0.05 was used to select
  significant pathways and ‐log (p‐value) was used for visualization. (b) Immunoblot
  measuring expression of phosphorylated eIF2α and phosphorylated PERK in HPDE‐H6c7
  and hTERT‐HPNE cells treated with PANC‐1 cEVs, PPCL‐68 cEVs or normal cell nEVs
  24 h post treatment. (c) Levels of arginine, glutamine, proline, phenylalanine,
  and succinate in cEVs and nEVs as determined by LC‐MS/MS. Means with standard deviations
  are plotted. N = 3 independent EV isolations per condition. ns = p > 0.05, * = p
  ≤ 0.05, ** = p ≤ 0.01, *** = p ≤ 0.001 and **** = p ≤ 0.0001.
