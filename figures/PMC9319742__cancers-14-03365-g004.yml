caption: Cancer-associated fibroblasts induce Notch3 activation in the co-culture
  model. (A) Immunofluorescence images depicting the localization pattern (both membranous
  and cytoplasmic) of Jag1 in CAFs. CAFs from patients II and V did not show membranous
  Jagged-1. Notably, Jag1 expression showed heterogeneity across different cells within
  an individual and across patients (n = 1). (B,C) Co-culture of these CAFs induced
  differential levels of Notch3 activation in SNFT as indicated by the luciferase
  signal (n = 1). Note that CAF II and CAF V co-culture did not activate Notch3 in
  SNFT (n = 1). ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.
