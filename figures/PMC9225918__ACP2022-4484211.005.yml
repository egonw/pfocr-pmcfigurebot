caption: Anlotinib combined with 5-FU affected cell proliferation through Src/AKT
  pathway in the H446 cells through Western blot. (a)p -AKT/pan-AKT, p-ERK/total ERK,
  pVEGFR/VEGFR2 p-Src/Src, and GAPDH in each treatment group were tested by Western
  blot. (b) The relative protein expression of which relative to GAPDH was analyzed
  by GraphPad Prism. (c) The relative protein expression of pAKT/pERK/pVEGFR/p-Src
  relative to pan-AKT/total-ERK/VEGFR2/Src was analyzed by GraphPad Prism. The results
  are from the three independent experiments.∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with
  anlotinib.
