caption: Knockdown of MRPS27 inhibits the stemness properties of TNBC cells. (A and
  B) Western blot (A) and qRT-PCR (B) analyses revealing the knockdown efficiency
  of MRPS27 in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. (C) The flow chart for ribosome profiling
  in MRP27 knockdown TNBC cells and control cells. (D) Functional pathway analysis
  of differentially expressed genes identified from ribosome profiling in MRP27 knockdown
  MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells compared with control cells. (E) Sphere formation of
  MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells after knockdown of MRPS27 cultured in ultra-low attachment
  6-well plates with serum-free stem cell medium. Scale bar = 20 Î¼m. (F) Western blot
  analysis for stemness-related proteins after knockdown of MRPS27 in MDA-MB-231 and
  BT549 cells. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
