caption: 'The effects of IRIN silicasome plus radiation therapy on the CRC xenograft
  tumor model (A) Ex vivo IVIS imaging of mice with subcutaneous tumor receiving IV
  injection of DyLight680-labeled silicasome. Tumor and organs were harvested at 48 h
  after a single IV injection of silicasome at an IRIN equivalent dose of 40 mg/kg.
  (B) Quantitation of average NIR fluorescence intensity for tumors and organs. Mice
  that did not receive silicasome served as background tissue autofluorescence. Data
  were presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (C) Confocal laser scanning microscopy of silicasome
  distribution in murine tumor used in (A). Red: DyLight680-labeled silicasome. Green:
  Blood vessels stained with CD31. Blue: DAPI. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) PK profile of
  a single IV injection of free IRIN or IRIN silicasome at an IRIN equivalent dose
  of 40 mg/kg (n = 3). Circulatory t1/2 and AUC0-t values were calculated using PKSolver
  software. (E) IRIN content in the tumor at 48 and 72 h after a single IV injection
  of 40 mg/kg IRIN by the different carriers (free drug and silicasome). (F) Tumor
  volume measurement of MC38 subcutaneous xenograft tumor in different treatment groups
  (n = 6). Mice were treated with free IRIN and IRIN silicasome at an IRIN equivalent
  dose of 40 mg/kg IV every 3 days with a total of four administrations (red arrow).
  Radiation therapy was performed on the day after chemotherapy with an X-ray irradiator
  (SARRP3) (blue arrow). The dose was 2 Gy X-rays per fraction with a total of 4 fractions.
  Treatment was initiated when the tumor volume reached ∼100 mm3. Data were analyzed
  by ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
