caption: 'Suramin positively regulated NOX2/p67phox expression and was involved in
  differentiation of primary chondrocytes. a) to c) The chondrocytes were pretreated
  with a) N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), b) diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), and c)
  apocynin for one hour followed by treatment with or without 10 μM suramin for 24
  hours. Total cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with specific antibodies
  as indicated. d) Chondrocytes were transfected with pLKO.1-p67 phox-shRNA or empty
  vector followed by treatment with 10 μM suramin for 24 hours, then total cell lysates
  were collected and subjected to western blot with specific antibodies as indicated.
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared with untreated control; ###p < 0.001 compared
  to the control. ACAN, aggrecan; COL2A1, collagen, type II, alpha 1; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium
  chloride; NOX, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase; shRNA,
  short hairpin (sh) RNA.'
