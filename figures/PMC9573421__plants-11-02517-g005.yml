caption: (a) Sulforaphane effects on Nrf2 signaling pathway. Sulforaphane promotes
  dissociation of Nrf2 from its negative regulator Keap1 leading to nuclear translocation
  and binding to the specific DNA sequence antioxidant response element (ARE) within
  small musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins (sMaf) inducing the antioxidant
  protein expression. (b) Effects of sulforaphane on skeletal muscle. Sulforaphane
  inhibits NF-ÎºB inflammatory signaling and reduces muscle oxidative damage biomarkers
  such malonaldehyde (MDA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatin phospho-kinase
  (CPK). Sulforaphane is capable of promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving
  aerobic endurance capacity, and enhancing satellite cell activation and proliferation.
