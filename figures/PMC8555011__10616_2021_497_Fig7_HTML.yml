caption: 'Effect of d-ECM powder (ECM-P) on the aggregation of ADSCs cultured in 3D
  system. a As indicated by the white arrows, ECM-P at 2 mg/mL was imaged immediately
  after grinding using an inverted microscope. Scale bar = 40 μm. b Cell aggregation
  with different ECM-P concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8 mg/mL) were observed microscopically
  on day 3 post reseeding. PD98059 was used to inhibit ERK1/2 signalling. Scale bars = 200 μm.
  The longest diameters of 10 spheroids treated with no PD98059 were measured using
  ImageJ 1.8.0 for statistical analysis. **p < 0.01, versus ECM-P 0 mg/mL group; #p < 0.05,
  versus ECM-P 2 mg/mL group; ##p < 0.01, versus ECM-P 2 mg/mL group; &p < 0.05, versus
  ECM-P 4 mg/mL group. c ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9
  in the spheroids treated with ECM-P were examined by Western blotting analysis.
  Equal protein loading was demonstrated by GAPDH. N = 3. **p < 0.01, versus ECM-P
  0 mg/mL group; ##p < 0.01, versus ECM-P 2 mg/mL group; &&p < 0.01, versus ECM-P
  4 mg/mL group'
