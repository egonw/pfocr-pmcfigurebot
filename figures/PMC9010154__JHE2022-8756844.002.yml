caption: Assessment and manipulation of AIM2 expression in GC cell lines (∗P < 0.05,
  Data obtained from three independent are represented as means and standard errors.)
  (a, b) AIM2 levels were assessed in the indicated GC cells via Western blotting
  and qPCR. (c, d) An shRNA construct was used to knock down AIM2 expression in GC823
  and MGC 803 cells, as confirmed via qPCR.
