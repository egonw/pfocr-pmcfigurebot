caption: Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway defects. Under normal circumstances,
  cytosolic DNA (such as from invading viruses) allosterically activates the cGAS
  enzyme (not shown) to generate cGAMP from GTP and ATP. cGAMP binds to STING, which
  then transports from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus through
  the COPII transport complex. Activated STING leads to production of interferons
  (through IRF3) and enhanced autophagy. STING is subsequently recycled back to the
  ER through the COPI complex. In SAVI, gain of function (GOF) variants in TMEM173
  (encoding STING) result in constitutive STING signaling. In COPA syndrome, STING
  is appropriately activated by cGAMP; however, STING becomes trapped in the Golgi
  apparatus due to variants in COPA that inactivate the COPI complex. In both scenarios,
  there is increased autophagy and type I interferon signaling. Janus kinase (JAK)
  inhibitors specifically target the IFN signaling. Image created on BioRender.com.
