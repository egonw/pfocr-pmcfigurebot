caption: Association of aerobic glycolysis with PC immune evasion, survival, and cancer
  stemness. (A) Network plot depicting the relationship between multiple metabolisms
  and infiltrating immune subsets. (B) Violin plot depicting the status of infiltrating
  immune cells of samples with high or low glycolysis. (C) Survival analysis of patients
  with differential glycolytic statuses.
