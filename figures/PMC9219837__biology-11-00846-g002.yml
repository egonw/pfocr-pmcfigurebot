caption: Construction and optimization of GAD-based GABA synthetic pathway. (A) Construction
  of an inducible-controlled expression cassette responsible for GABA synthesis. Three
  GADs encoded by gad and gadM genes from E. coli as well as the gadB gene from Lactobacillus
  plantarum were overexpressed under the Ptac promoter control, respectively. (B)
  Fermentation profiles of C. glutamicum strains overexpressing different gad genes
  in shake flask cultivations. The solid lines represent the growth, and the dotted
  lines represent the GABA concentration. (C) The mono-cistronic and bi-cistronic
  expression cassettes of GadM under the control of a constitutive promoter Ptuf.
  (D) RNAFold depiction of the mRNA secondary structures with the corresponding minimum
  free energy (ΔG) for mono-cistronic and bi-cistionic (Gsi, Tsf, GuaB-fused GadM)
  sequences. (E) Expression of GadM detected by SDS-PAGE in C. glutamicum ATCC13032.
  Lane 1, crude protein extract from C. glutamicum/pXMJ19; Lane 2, crude protein extract
  from C. glutamicum/pXMJ19-Ptuf-gadM; Lane 3, crude protein extract from C. glutamicum/pXMJ19-Ptuf-gsi-gadM;
  Lane 4, crude protein extract from C. glutamicum/pXMJ19-Ptuf-tsf-gadM; Lane 5, crude
  protein extract from C. glutamicum/pXMJ19-Ptuf-guaB-gadM. (F) GABA productions of
  C. glutamicum harboring different expression cassettes of GadM in shake flask cultivations.
  Data are presented as mean values with the standard deviation from three biological
  replicates. Significant differences were determined using Student’s t test (* p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
