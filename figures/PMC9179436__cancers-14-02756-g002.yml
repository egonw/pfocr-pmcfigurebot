caption: Immunosuppression network mechanism of TADCs, Tregs, and MDSCs in TME. iDCs
  activate IDO1 expression through CTLA-4 ligation with B7, then are transformed into
  tDCs lacking the function of activating CD8 + T-cell upon induction of IFN-γ from
  TME. IDO1 of tDCs can be strongly induced by the Kyn metabolite 3-HAA and the Wnt3a
  and Wnt5a receptors accumulated in TME. Kyn produced by tDCs metabolism binds to
  AhR of T cells, stimulating their differentiation into Foxp3 + Tregs. In response
  to depleted Trp, the GCN2 pathway of Foxp3 + Tregs is activated to suppress tumor
  immune responses. Tumor-derived IL-6 promotes STAT3 phosphorylation, which upregulates
  NF-κB-driven IDO1 expression and activates immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.
  On the other hand, high expression of CARD9 in MDSCs inhibits immunosuppressive
  function via the NF-κB pathway. Foxp3 + Tregs and MDSCs interact to influence each
  other’s ability to migrate to tumors. Moreover, IDO1-activated Tregs cause proliferation
  of TAMs.
