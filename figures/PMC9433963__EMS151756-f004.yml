caption: Cells sensitive to ATR inhibition exhibit higher levels of endogenous RS
  activation and DNA-PK activation. The expression and phosphorylation of key players
  in ATR pathway, RS, NHEJ, and DNA damage was measured by Western blot analysis after
  24 hours treatment with 1 Î¼mol/L ATRi ceralasertib, 4 hours HU at a concentration
  of 2.5 mmol/L, or combination of the two agents (20 hours only ATRi followed by
  4 hours ATRi+HU). Cell extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies
  and HSP90 was used as a loading control.
