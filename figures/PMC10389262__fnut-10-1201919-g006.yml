caption: 'Differential metabolic pathway analysis of model group and control group.
  The relevant thresholds were set as follows: −log (P) > 1.0 and pathway impact value
  >0.2. The ordinate represents −log (P), and the darker the color, the higher the
  significance level. The horizontal axis represents the importance of metabolic pathways,
  and the larger the circle, the more important the pathway. Three metabolic pathways
  were interfered, namely, phenylalanine metabolism; Biosynthesis of phenylalanine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan; Glycerol phospholipid metabolism.'
