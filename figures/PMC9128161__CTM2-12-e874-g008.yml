caption: 'Identification of tumour cells from squamous epithelium. (A) UMAP plots
  indicate in different colours the subclusters of the epithelial cluster. The histopathological
  origin of cells is indicated in different shapes. (B) Clustered heatmap showing
  single‐cell copy number profiles estimated by CopyKAT from all squamous epithelial
  cells. CopyKAT classifications of diploid normal cells and aneuploid tumour cells
  and cell sources are indicated on the annotation bars to the left. Chromosome numbers
  are indicated at the top of the CHR bar. The magenta‐coloured boxes indicate chromosome
  amplification of 3q, 8q, 20p and 20q. (C) UMAP embedding of the inferred CopyKAT
  diploid and aneuploid copy number profiles (all squamous epithelial cells). NA:
  undefined cells. (D) Karyotype ideogram showing diploid cells in adjacent normal
  tissues and aneuploid cells in HIN tissues (n = 3). 2n: the number of chromosomes.
  H&E, staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Scale bars, 60 μm for top panels. (E)
  Differential pathway enriched in tumour cells and squamous epithelial cells derived
  from normal tissues by GSVA. Two‐sided unpaired limma‐moderated t‐test. (F) Heatmap
  showing different pathways enriched in adjacent normal and tumour cells by GSVA
  analysis, coloured by z‐score transformed mean GSVA scores. Different line colours
  indicate adjusted p‐values compared between two groups: purple, p < 0.05. Two‐sided
  unpaired limma‐moderated t‐test. (G) Bubble plot showing the enriched metabolic
  pathways between adjacent normal and tumour cells. *: the most significant pathway
  to metabolic heterogeneities'
