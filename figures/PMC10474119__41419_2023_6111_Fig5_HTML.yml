figure_title: TGR5 knockdown disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and promotes cGAS-STING-mediated
  inflammatory response
caption: 'Müller cells were transfected with TGR5 siRNA under HG stimulation (A–C).
  A Representative confocal images showing mPTP opening in Müller cells. Scale bars = 25 μm.
  B Representative immunofluorescence images showing co-localization of dsDNA (green)
  and Tom20 (red). Blue=DAPI; yellow=merge. Scale bars = 25 μm. C Representative immunofluorescence
  images showing co-localization of dsDNA (green) and cGAS (red). Blue=DAPI; yellow=merge.
  Scale bars = 25 μm. Müller cells were transfected with TGR5 siRNA and treated with
  or without cGAS/STING inhibitors under HG stimulation (D, E). D Representative western
  blot showing p-IRF3, IRF3, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB protein levels in Müller cells (n = 3).
  E Representative western Blot showing IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β protein levels in Müller
  cells (n = 3). Data are shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05 versus CON group, #p < 0.05
  versus HG group. &p < 0.05 versus siTGR5 group.'
