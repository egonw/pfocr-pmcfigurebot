caption: A hypothetical model for iris plants in response to cold stress during winter.
  Arrows indicate promotion, whereas lines ending with a bar suggest suppression.
  The blue line indicates that cold signaling partially directly regulates the leaf
  freezing tolerance of plants through the ICE–CBF–COR cascade. The orange lines indicate
  phytohormones and sugars that facilitate reactive oxygen species scavenging. The
  levels of jasmonic acid (JA) were proportional to sucrose concentration in evergreen
  irises, and the green line indicates a putative pathway. Gene names are shown in
  .
