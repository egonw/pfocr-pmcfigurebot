caption: Immunofluorescence double staining of HO-1 and IL-1β in mouse anterior horn
  motor neuron cells near the injury site, 3 days after SCI. The protein expression
  of HO-1 (A,B) and IL-1β (C,D) was detected by the immunofluorescence double-staining
  technique, in anterior horn motor neuron cells near the injury site in each group’s
  mice (n = 6, scale bar = 100 µm). Data are shown as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
