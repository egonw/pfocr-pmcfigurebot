caption: Inhibition of mTORC1 pathway alleviates ALD in Postn-/-mice. (A) Schematic
  images of Postn-/- mice treated with rapamycin. (B–C) Western blot analysis of the
  mTORC1 and autophagy-related proteins in the livers of Postn-/- mice treated with
  rapamycin. (D–E) Body weight changes and food intake in Postn-/- mice with rapamycin
  treatment (n = 6–8 mice per group). (F) The ratios of liver-to-body weight in the
  livers of Postn-/- mice with rapamycin treatment. (G–H) Serum (G) and hepatic (H)
  levels of TG, T-CHO, AST, and ALT in Postn-/- mice administrated with rapamycin.
  (I–J) The relative mRNA levels of inflammation (I) and fibrosis-related genes (J)
  in the livers of Postn-/- mice treated with rapamycin. (n = 6–8 mice per group).
  (K) H&E staining and Oil red staining in the livers of Postn-/- mice with rapamycin
  treatment. (L) Sirius red and Masson staining of the livers of Postn-/- mice injected
  with rapamycin. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation (3 independently repeated
  experiments); ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001; n.s., not significant (Student t
  test). Scale bars, 50 μm.
