figure_title: GPSM1 deficiency alleviates metabolic inflammation in HFD-fed mice
caption: a–k Male GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre and age-matched GPSM1f/f mice were fed a HFD
  for 12 weeks. a Representative F4/80+ staining of eWAT sections. Scale bars, 100
  μm. b Flow cytometry quantification of eWAT and scWAT F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages from
  GPSM1f/f and GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre mice (n = 6 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f
  and n = 5 biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre). c Flow cytometry
  quantification of TIM4− subset of total macrophages (n = 3 biologically independent
  mice per group). d Representative flow cytometry analysis and quantification of
  the expression of CD11c from CD45+F4/80+ cells in SVFs from eWAT and scWAT (n = 5
  biologically independent mice for GPSM1f/f and n = 4 biologically independent mice
  for GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre). e Representative flow cytometry analysis and quantification
  of the expression of CD206 from CD45+F4/80+ cells in SVFs from eWAT and scWAT (n = 3
  biologically independent mice per group). RT-qPCR analysis indicating mRNA abundance
  of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes in eWAT (f, n = 10 biologically
  independent mice per group) and scWAT (g, n = 9 biologically independent mice per
  group). h Serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL2 (n = 8 biologically
  independent mice per group). i Representative Masson’s trichrome staining of eWAT
  sections. Scale bars, 100 μm. RT-qPCR analysis indicating mRNA abundance of collagen
  synthesis genes in eWAT (j) and scWAT (k), n = 9 biologically independent mice per
  group. l, m Male GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-cre and age-matched GPSM1f/f mice were fed a HFD
  for 5 weeks. l Representative flow cytometry analysis and quantification of the
  expression of CD11c from CD45+F4/80+ cells in SVFs from eWAT (n = 5 biologically
  independent mice per group) and scWAT (n = 3 biologically independent mice per group).
  m RT-PCR analysis indicating mRNA abundance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  genes in eWAT (n = 7 biologically independent mice per group). The experiments were
  repeated five times with similar results (a, i). Throughout, data are presented
  as means ± SEM. P values are determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test
  (b–h, j to m).
