caption: Up‐regulation of hsa_circ_0072309 and ACKR3, and down‐regulation of miR‐100
  in preoperative serum specimens from NSCLC BM+ patients. Graphs showing the relative
  RNA expression of hsa_circ_0072309 (A), ACKR3 (B), and miR‐100 (C) in preoperative
  serum specimens from BM+ patients as detected by qPCR. (D) Graph showing the expression
  of ACKR3 protein in serum specimens as detected by ELISA. *** versus Healthy person,
  p < 0.001; $$$ versus NSCLC BM−, p < 0.001.
article_title: Circulating hsa_circ_0072309, acting via the miR‐100/ACKR3 pathway,
  maybe a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain
  metastasis from non‐small‐cell lung cancer.
