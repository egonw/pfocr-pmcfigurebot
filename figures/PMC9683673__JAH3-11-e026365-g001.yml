figure_title: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 increases the levels of myocardial
  fibrosis markers in vitro by activating the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway
caption: A through F, The protein levels of α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA), collagen‐1,
  collagen‐3, Shh, Smoothened (Smo), and glioma 1 (Gli‐1) in the FGF23 group were
  significantly increased compared with those in the control group. No significant
  differences were observed between the negative control (NC)+FGF23 group and the
  FGF23 group. Levels of the α‐SMA, collagen‐1, collagen‐3, Shh, Smo, and Gli‐1 proteins
  in the plasmid carrying the Shh gene (Shhp)+FGF23 group were significantly higher
  than those in the NC+FGF23 group. α‐SMA, collagen‐1, collagen‐3, Shh, Smo, and Gli‐1
  protein levels in the plasmid carrying an RNA interference sequence targeting the
  Shh gene (Shh‐RNAi)+FGF23 group were significantly decreased compared with those
  in the NC+FGF23 group (n=3 samples/group, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001). Cells
  were primary myocardial fibroblasts.
