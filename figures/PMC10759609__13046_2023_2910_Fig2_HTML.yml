caption: Effect of PDPN on the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway in melanoma cells.
  A Western blot analysis was performed to detect the Wnt/β-catenin signaling-related
  proteins. β-actin as an internal control was used. B Statistical analysis was performed
  to quantify the relative protein levels. C Immunofluorescence staining was conducted
  to quantify PDPN effects on the nuclear β-catenin intensity in melanoma cell lines.
  The power field scale bar, 20 μm. D Statistical analysis was performed to quantify
  the immunofluorescence intensity of nuclear β-catenin in A875 cells. E Western blot
  assay was also performed on nuclear proteins related to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway including β-catenin, phospho-β-catenin, LEF1, and TCF1/TCF7. The LaminB1
  was used as an internal control for nuclear proteins. F Statistical analysis was
  performed to quantify the relative protein levels. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
