caption: SARS‐CoV‐2 NSP1 interferes with the host antiviral responses. (Left) The
  entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the cytoplasm of the infected cell introduces double‐stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) that triggers the activation of innate immune pathways that lead to
  the production of type I interferon IFN‐α and ‐β which are secreted by the infected
  cell. (Right) The produced type I interferons will then activate, through a cascade
  of phosphorylations, the antiviral response by stimulating the expression of IFN‐Stimulated
  Genes (ISGs). The SARS‐CoV‐2 viral protein NSP1 shuts down the antiviral response
  by interfering with multiple steps of this pathway (the steps inhibited by NSP1
  are shown in red).
