caption: Partial Signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of TNBC.
  PARP is a DNA repair enzyme, which can promote the repair of single strand DNA breaks.
  PARP inhibitors can suppress DNA repair resulting in cytotoxicity. Notch receptors
  (Notch 1–4) on the surface of one cell bind to ligands ( Dll 1, 3, 4, and JAG 1,
  2), thus activate Notching pathways. The Notch ligand–receptor complex is hydrolyzed
  by the ADAM17/TACE metalloprotease and γ-secretase in turn, releasing the intracellular
  domain of Notch into the nucleus. AR bind to endogenous androgens, and then form
  a homodimer. Before homodimer, AR is bound to HSP. Subsequently, the homodimer moves
  into to the nucleus and activates target gene transcription, regulating cell proliferation.
  ADCs consist of a highly efficient cytotoxic payload, an antibody and a linker connecting
  the former two components. ADC binds to target antigens on tumor cell surface and
  then enter the target cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. After entering the
  cell, ADCs are degraded by lysosomes, in which the linker cleaves, leading to the
  release of payloads into cytoplasm. When the Wnt signaling is on, Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway is activated from the combination of lipid-modified Wnts and the
  receptor complex which is composed of Fzds and LRP5/6. Dvl inhibit the destruction
  complex, inhibiting the β-catenin proteasomal degradation. therefore, the β-catenin
  enter into the nucleus. After entering into the nucleus, β-catenin binds to T cell
  factor and LEF families and regulates Wnt target gene expression. When Wnt ligands
  are absent in the cytoplasm, β-catenin is sequestered by the destruction complex
  (APC, GSK-3β and CK1α), and then phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK-3β in turn. TGF-β
  is excreted by cells and then successively binds to TβRII and TβRI on the surface
  of cell. During this process, two TβRI and two TβRII molecules form a heterotetrametric
  complex, further causing the phosphorylation and activation of TβRI. After that,
  the activated complex phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 in sequence, which bind to
  SMAD4 to form SMAD trimer complex. Finally, the complex translocates into nuclei
  and promotes target gene transcription
