caption: LINC01234 has ribosome binding sites across several perspectives. (A) The
  translation abilities of some open reading frames (ORFs) encoded from long noncoding
  RNAs (lncRNAs) were tested in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCT116 and gastric
  cancer cell line MKN-45, and LINC01234ORF showed positive signals (left panel).
  This ORF was contained in the exon 3 of LINC01234 (right panel). (B) LINC01234 was
  overexpressed in the human CRC tissues compared to the adjacent noncancerous tissues
  (n = 30), data are presented as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05. (C) LINC01234 gradually increased
  in CRC from stage I to stage V. (D) Ribosome footprint profiling dataset POSTAR3
  indicated that HCT116 owned the highest expression of ORFs originating from LINC01234,
  and it pointed out the same possible translation region as the right panel of (A).
  (E) GWIPS-viz browser showed the identical ribosome footprints’ peaks of LINC01234
  with (A,D) in HCT116.
