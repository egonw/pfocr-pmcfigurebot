figure_title: The polyol pathway regulates nuclear localization of ChREBP in hepatocytes
  and glucose tolerance in mice
caption: '(A, B) Body weight (A) and cumulative energy intake in control and Sord
  KO mice (B) were measured for 14 weeks. n = 4 for control, n = 4 for Sord KO. (C–N)
  Water (DW), glucose, or fructose were administered orally to starved control and
  Sord KO mice, and the localization of ChREBP in the hepatocytes was examined 15
  minutes after administration. Liver slices were stained with the following markers:
  anti-ChREBP antibody (red), anti-CYP3A4 for pericentral hepatocytes (green), and
  DAPI for nuclei (blue). Scale bar represents 30 μm. (O) The ratio of average intensity
  of ChREBP signals detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the pericentral hepatocytes.
  Solid and dotted lines in the graph show the median and quartiles, respectively.
  Images of 539 to 910 hepatocytes per experiment were quantified. n = 3 animals per
  experiment. (P) The amount of hepatic triacylglyceride was quantified in control
  and Sord KO mice. (Q) Blood glucose levels were measured over a 90-minute period
  after glucose administration. (R) AUC was calculated relative to the fast blood
  glucose concentrations. n = 4 for control, n = 10 for Sord KO. (S) Plasma insulin
  levels were measured before and 15 minutes after glucose administration. n = 6 for
  control, n = 5 for Sord KO. All experiments were conducted using male mice. *P <
  0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001. The data underlying the graphs can be found in
  . AUC, area under the curve; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein;
  KO, knockout.'
