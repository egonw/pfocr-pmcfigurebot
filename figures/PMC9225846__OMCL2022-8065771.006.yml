caption: ADSC-Exos activate PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways in GC-1 spg
  cells. (a) PKH26-labeled ADSC-Exos internalization by GC-1 spg cells. (b–e) Western
  blot analysis of protein levels of p-AKT and p-ERK induced by different concentrations
  of ADSC-Exos or pathway inhibitors. Bars, 200 μm. Data are represented as mean ±
  SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
