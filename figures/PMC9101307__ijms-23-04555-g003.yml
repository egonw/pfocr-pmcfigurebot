caption: MiRNAs regulate synaptic plasticity-related signalling pathways in depression.
  Where miRNAs can directly target key genes in the Wnt signalling pathway and affect
  the expression of the Wnt signalling pathway and downstream proteins, the Wnt signalling
  pathway also affects the expression of CREB. MiRNAs affect the expression level
  and phosphorylation of CREB, which further affects downstream proteins of CREB,
  such as BDNF. MiRNAs affect the expression level of BDNF, and reduced BDNF expression
  affects synaptic plasticity. In the process of neurogenesis, axon growth, and dendrite
  and spine generation, miRNAs can influence each of these through the Wnt, CREB,
  and BDNF signalling pathways and are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity.
