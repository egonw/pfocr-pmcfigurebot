caption: 'Overexpression of transcription factor HOXB5 reverses the inhibitory effects
  of ANGPT2 silencing on proliferation of EC-9706 esophageal cancer cells. (A) Relative
  mRNA and protein expression levels of ANGPT2 were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blot analysis. (B) Viability of EC-9706 cells was detected using
  Cell Counting Kit-8. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC. ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. shRNA-ANGPT2 + pcDNA3.1. (C) Proliferation was detected using EdU staining (scale
  bar, 50 Âµm). (D) Colony forming ability was detected using colony formation assay
  (scale bar, 34 mm). HOXB5, homeobox B5; ANGPT2, angiopoietin-2; shRNA, short harpin
  RNA; OD, optical density; NC, negative control.'

  and angiogenic effect of esophageal cancer cells via activating ERK/AKT signaling
  pathway.
