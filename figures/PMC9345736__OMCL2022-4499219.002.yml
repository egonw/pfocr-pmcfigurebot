caption: DRD2 activation with quinpirole alleviated acinar cell necroptosis via inhibiting
  CTSB. Isolated PACs were pretreated with quinpirole (5 μM) for 0.5 h and then stimulated
  with 200 nM CCK with or without LLOMe(0.5 mM) for 6 h. Cell injury determined by
  (a) the percentage of ATP depletion and (b) LDH leakage (n=3 per group). (c) RIP1
  was immunoprecipitated from acinar cell lysates and immunoblot analysis for RIP1
  and RIP3. (d, e) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL
  proteins of PACs (n =4 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
