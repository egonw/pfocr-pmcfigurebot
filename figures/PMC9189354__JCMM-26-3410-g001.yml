caption: Migration inhibitory factor directly bound to SLC3A2, and regulated the AKT/GSK‐3β
  signalling pathway. (A) Co‐IP assays were performed to verify the binding of MIF
  with SLC3A2. (B) MIF protein expression in SW480 cells. (C) SLC3A2 protein expression
  in SW480 cells. (D) Western blotting was performed to confirm the expression of
  MIF and SLC3A2 proteins in SW480 cells. (E) MIF protein expression in SW620 cells.
  (F) SLC3A2 protein expression in SW620 cells. (G) Western blotting was performed
  to confirm the expression of MIF and SLC3A2 proteins in SW620 cells. (H) pAKT, AKT,
  pGSK‐3β and GSK‐3β protein expression in SW480 cells. (I) pAKT, AKT, pGSK‐3β and
  GSK‐3β protein expression in SW620 cells. ‘*’ means p < 0.05 when compared with
  the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05 when compared with the shCon group. GAPDH
  served as an invariant internal control for calculating fold changes in protein
  expression
