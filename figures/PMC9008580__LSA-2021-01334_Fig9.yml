figure_title: Illustration of N-glycan building rescue by UDP-GlcNAc under glucose
  scarcity
caption: (Left hand) In glucose sufficient condition, substrates are provided to produce
  UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-Man, two nucleotide sugars necessary for the building of N-glycans
  in the ER. Building of N-glycans and their transfer onto newly synthesized proteins
  (wavy line), including epidermal growth factor receptor, enhances proper protein
  folding allowing their transport via COPII vesicle to Golgi and plasma membrane.
  (Right hand) Glucose shortage reduces GDP-Man levels, whereas those of hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathwayâ€™s terminal metabolite are better maintained. This persisting
  UDP-GlcNAc pool is actively used to initiate N-glycan building, leading to incomplete
  N-glycan precursors that are nonetheless transferred onto protein. Proteins bearing
  only GlcNAc2 structures (chitobiose) are likely degraded (). However, maintained
  UDP-GlcNAc production also promotes chitobiose elongation by mannoses, through yet
  unclear mechanisms, rescuing some protein folding. This adaptive mechanism (marked
  in red), together with a selective increase in COPII transport, unlocks protein
  transport to the cell surface and promotes an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent
  cellular protective function.
