caption: 'TBX1 regulates TGF-β signaling pathway-related factors: (a) qPCR results
  confirmed that TBX1 increased the mRNA levels of Smad2 and Smad3 and decreased those
  of MEF2C on day 7. (b, c) Western blot analysis showed that TBX1 increased the expression
  levels of Smad2/Smad3 and P-Smad2/Smad3, decreased those of MEF2C. Mean ± s.e.m.,
  Student’s t-test, two-tailed, (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). DIF7: differentiation
  for 7 days. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)'
