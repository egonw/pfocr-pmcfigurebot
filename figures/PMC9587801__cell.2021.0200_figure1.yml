caption: '(A) Time series heatmap based on 4863 highly significant DEG (padj <0.01,
  2075 downregulated and 2788 upregulated) on days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of neuronal
  conversion. (B) PCA of 26 selected neuronal genes. Each circle is one subject at
  a certain time point (distinguished by color). (C) Enrichment plot of TGF-beta signaling
  pathway in GSEA differentially expressed between iNs and FBs. Red: positively correlated
  with iNs; blue: positively correlated with FBs. (D) Time series heatmap of 13 TGFβ
  signaling pathway receptor genes on days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of neuronal conversion.
  Orange: BMP signaling arm; dark blue: TGFβ1 signaling arm; turquoise: Co-SMAD. (E)
  Regression analysis of mean expression values in BMP (orange) and TGFβ1 (dark blue)
  signaling arms on days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of neuronal conversion. (F) Regression
  analysis of BMP signaling arm-specific receptor genes ACVR1 (orange), ACVRL1 (dark
  blue), BMPR1A (turquoise), and BMPR1B (yellow) on days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of neuronal
  conversion. BMP, bone morphogenic protein; DEGs, differentially expressed genes;
  FBs, fibroblasts; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; iN, induced neuron; PCA, principal
  component analysis; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β.'
