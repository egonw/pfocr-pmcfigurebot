caption: Thyroid hormone induces abundances of PD-L1 in human oral cancer cells. OEC-M1
  cells and SCC-25 cells were treated with different concentrations of thyroid hormone
  (T4, 10-8 to 10-6 M) for 24 h. (A) Thyroid hormone-induced PD-L1 expression in both
  oral cancer cell. (B) OEC-M1 cells and (C) SCC-25 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of T4 for 24 h. Cells were harvested. Total protein was extracted
  and Western blot analyses of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, PD-L1 were performed in Data were
  presented as the mean ± SD. Results are from three independent studies (n = 3).
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared to the control. I.O.D., intensity
