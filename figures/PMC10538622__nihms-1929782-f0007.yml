figure_title: Effect of Saracatinib on Atherosclerosis in vivo
caption: 'a, Experimental design to study the effect of saracatinib 6.25 (S6.25),
  12.5 (S12.5) or 25 (S25) mg kg−1 d−1; atorvastatin (AT; 10 mg kg−1 d−1); or the
  combination of saracatinib and atorvastatin (S + AT; 12.5 or 25 and 10 mg kg−1 d−1)
  admixed to WD on plaque burden, composition and gene expression compared with WD
  alone in male Apoe−/− mice. This figure was created with Biorender.com. b, Representative
  images of en face preparation of aortas stained with ORO. c, Bar graphs with overlapping
  dots of en face ORO+ area quantification (plaque area). WD, n = 10; AT, n = 9; S6.25,
  n = 6; S12.5, n = 9; S25, n = 8; S12.5 + AT, n = 10; S25 + AT, n = 8 mice. P values
  were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test across all groups. d,
  Representative images of CD68 immunostaining of the aortic root (4× magnification).
  e, Bar graphs with overlapping dots of CD68+ area quantification. WD, n = 10; AT,
  n = 10; S6.25, n = 10; S12.5, n = 5; S25, n = 10; S12.5 + AT, n = 5; S25 + AT, n
  = 5 mice. P values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
  Data are presented as mean ± s.d. f, Heat map of the top 100 DEGs hierarchically
  clustered expressed in the aortas across treated mice. WD, n = 5; AT, n = 3; S,
  n = 6; S + AT, n = 4 mice. Rows, z-scored gene expression values; columns, individual
  aortas. The treatment categories are indicated above the heat map and the dendrograms
  on the right indicate the DEGs enriched in the different categories. P values were
  determined by the two-sided binomial proportions test. g, Top DEGs involved in the
  TCA cycle and OXPHOS induced by saracatinib in the aortas of treated mice, n = 6.
  This figure was created with Biorender.com. h, GO molecular functions of the top
  100 DEGs upregulated in the saracatinib group, n = 6 mice. The combined score (c)
  was calculated from the P value obtained using Fisher’s exact test. i, GO Biological
  Process of the top 100 DEGs upregulated in the saracatinib group, n = 6 mice. The
  combined score was calculated from the P value obtained using Fisher’s exact test.
  j, BioPlanet signaling pathway analysis of the top 100 DEGs upregulated in the saracatinib
  group, n = 6 mice. The combined score was calculated from the P value obtained using
  Fisher’s exact test. k, OCR and respiratory parameters in mouse BMDMs treated with
  vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), n = 5 biologically independent samples), DMSO
  + oxLDL (n = 4 biologically independent samples), 0.1 μM saracatinib (sara) or 0.1
  μM saracatinib + oxLDL (n = 5 biologically independent samples/condition). Data
  are presented as mean ± s.d. l, Summary of respiratory parameters in mouse BMDMs
  treated with vehicle (DMSO), DMSO + oxLDL, 0.1 μM saracatinib or 0.1 μM saracatinib
  + oxLDL (n = 5, biologically independent samples per condition): basal OCR, ATP
  production, maximal respiratory OCR, spare respiratory capacity. P values were determined
  by one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s post hoc test vs vehicle. Data are presented as mean
  ± s.d.'
