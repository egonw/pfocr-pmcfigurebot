caption: Involvement of SGK1 in major processes and cancers. (A) Most significant
  gene ontology biological processes in which SGK1 is involved. Positive regulation
  of transporter activity GO:0032411, regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor
  activity GO:0051090, long-term memory GO:0007616, neuron projection morphogenesis
  GO:0048812, regulation of blood pressure GO:0008217, regulation of cell growth GO:0001558,
  sodium ion transport GO:0006814, regulation of cell migration GO:0030334â€² regulation
  of cell population proliferation GO:0042127, regulation of apoptotic process GO:0042981,
  ion transmembrane transport GO:0034220. (B) Involvement of SGK1 in most significant
  signaling pathways, calculated using BioPlanet data. FSH signaling pathway bioplanet_552,
  aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption, bioplanet_458, FoxO family signaling
  bioplanet_616, regular glucocorticoid receptor pathway bioplanet_1321, mTOR signaling
  pathway bioplanet_117, interleukin-5 regulation of apoptosis bioplanet_1426, FSH
  regulation of apoptosis bioplanet_1435, insulin signaling pathway bioplanet_452,
  interleukin-2 signaling pathway, bioplanet_1421. (C) Most studied types of malignant
  diseases with a SGK1 playing certain role. Analyzed by biostatistics/bioinformatics
  at MAP Kinase Resource using data curated at Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Geneva,
  Switzeland) (Jonas Cicenas).
