caption: 'GPHD promotes hair growth in mice. (A) Six-week-old mice were fed a normal
  diet and distilled water (~0.9 mL/day) or GPHD, while the minoxidil group was fed
  a normal diet and distilled water (~0.9 mL/day) with an additional topical application
  of minoxidil for 15 days before being sacrificed. Images show hair growth progression
  on mouse dorsal skin on day 0, 7, 11, 13, and 15 after depilation. (B) Hair growth
  score was calculated in the following way: Hair growth score = (Area of A × 0) +
  (Area of B × 1) + (Area of C × 2)/total area. (C) H&E staining of mouse dorsal skin
  sections showed morphological changes in hair follicles and quantitative histomorphometry
  showed changes in hair cycle phases following treatment with minoxidil and GPHD.
  (D) Growth factors in each mouse group’s dorsal skin tissue were analyzed by real-time
  PCR. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. p-value
  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant; individual p-values (* p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005) are indicated. n.s; not significant.'
