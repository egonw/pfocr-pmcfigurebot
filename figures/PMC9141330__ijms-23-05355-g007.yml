caption: Schematic diagram of proposed model for MkMP-induced signaling in CD34+ HSPCs
  and its relationship to miRs in MkMPs. The model is based on the following pieces
  of evidence. Our data showed that a co-culture of CD34+ HSPCs with MkMPs activates
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and JNK signaling pathway toward cell expansion and megakaryocytic
  differentiation. Specifically, JNK and mTOR signaling are involved in late Mk differentiation
  (CD42b expression). A crosstalk between JNK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR was identified via
  the negative regulator of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, PTEN. PI3K and PTEN were known
  major targets of miR-486-5p.
