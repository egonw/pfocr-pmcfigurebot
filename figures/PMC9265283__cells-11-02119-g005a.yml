caption: The most enriched interaction network of differentially expressed proteins
  between the different groups. Red and green nodes indicate up- and downregulated
  proteins, respectively. Uncolored nodes are proposed by IPA and indicate potential
  targets that were functionally coordinated with the differentially expressed proteins.
  Solid lines indicate direct molecular interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect
  interactions. (A) Interaction network of differentially expressed proteins in the
  EC group compared to the HY group. Central nodes of the pathway related to signaling
  of ACTA2, AKT, and PI3K were found to be dysregulated between the two states. *
  appears next to any proteins for which the input file contained more than one identifier
  (B) Interaction network of differentially expressed proteins in the EC group compared
  to the Ctrl group. Central nodes of the pathway related to signaling of ACTB and
  ERK1/2 were found to be dysregulated between the two states. (C) Interaction network
  of differentially expressed proteins in the HY group compared to Ctrl group. Central
  nodes of the pathway related to signaling of VEGF, NFKB, and AKT were found to be
  dysregulated between the two states.
