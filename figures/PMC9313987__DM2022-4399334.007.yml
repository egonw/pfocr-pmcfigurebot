caption: 'Evodiamine exerts antiprostate cancer effects through PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (a) The binding mode of evodiamine with PI3K (left: 3D structure; right:
  2D structure). The yellow structure is evodiamine, and the green structure represents
  the binding site of PI3K. (b) The binding mode of evodiamine with AKT (left: 3D
  structure; right: 2D structure). The yellow structure is evodiamine, and the green
  structure represents the binding site of AKT. (c) After evodiamine treatment (0,
  1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, the expression levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKTSer473,
  AKT, p-NF-κBSer536, and NF-κB were detected by Western blotting. β-Actin was used
  as the loading control. (d) The quantitative data of relative protein expression
  shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus the
  control group.'
