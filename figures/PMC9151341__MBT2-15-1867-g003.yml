caption: 'Gene expression profiling of the enzymes and intracellular metabolite profiling
  of intermediates involved in central metabolic pathway in pkaC conditional expression
  mutants. Four samples of intracellular metabolite profiling were taken and analysed:
  progenitor control D353 (II), XMD5.1 without Dox (I), under 20 μg ml−1 Dox (III)
  and under 50 μg ml−1 Dox (IV). The peak intensity of each metabolite was first normalized
  against the total peak intensity within a sample. The relative level of each metabolite
  in a sample was calculated by dividing its normalized peak intensity by that of
  XMD5.1 without Dox (I). All metabolites’ intensities were determined by triplicate
  technical measurements. The green blocks represented the intracellular level of
  this metabolite under different conditions which was lower than the ones without
  the addition of Dox. The gene expression level of each gene was calculated as Reads
  Per Kilobase Million (RPKM). The genes labelled in green were down‐regulated the
  addition of Dox, while the genes labelled in red had a similar gene expression pattern
  to the pkaC gene. The genes labelled in black showed no significant change.'
