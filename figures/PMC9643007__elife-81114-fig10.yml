caption: (A) Schematic diagram showed the PDX transcriptome is a mixture of human
  RNAs (deriving from cancer cells) and mouse RNAs (deriving from stromal cells).
  (Bâ€“C) Transcriptional classification of paired human CRC samples and PDX derivatives
  in Uronis cohort (B) and Isella cohort (C). (D) Transcriptional classification of
  paired samples before and after radiotherapy. (E) UMAP projected all cells annotated
  by reference component analysis (RCA) in spatial distribution. (F) Identification
  of potential therapeutic agents for six subtypes. (G) The distribution of HRD score
  and HRD pathway mutations among six subtypes. Kruskal-Wallis test.
