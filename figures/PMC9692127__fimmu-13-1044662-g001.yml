caption: MYD88-activating CpG, but not TRIF-activating Poly I:C, confers resistance
  to S. aureus infection. (A) Mice were injected with TLR agonists (20 µg i.v.), or
  vehicle (Lactated Ringers) for two consecutive days prior to systemic challenge
  with S. aureus (i.v.). (B-D) Wild type (B), MyD88-KO (C), and TRIF-KO mice (D) were
  challenged with S. aureus and survival was monitored for 15 days (n=5-9/group).
  (E) Bacteremia was assessed 48h after infection. (F) Schematic of TLR agonist pathway
  specificity and downstream signaling. (G) Pathway specificity of MPLA, CpG, and
  Poly I:C were determined by Western blotting of protein isolated from wild type
  BMDMs treated for 24h with TLR agonists compared to unstimulated negative controls.
  (H) Survival was monitored for 15 days post-S. aureus inoculation (n = 20-21/group).
  (I) Bacteremia was assessed 48h after infection (n = 5-10). (J) Tissue bacterial
  load (CFU/gram) of lung and kidney was quantified at 72h post-infection (n = 8-10/group).
  (K) Mice were infected with 108 CFU S. aureus (i.v.) 1 day-post (1dp), 1 week-post
  (1wp) or 2 weeks-post (2wp) CpG treatment alongside vehicle-treated controls. (L)
  Survival was monitored for 15 days post-infection (n = 10-18/group). (M) Body weights
  were measured at baseline and after infection. (N, O) Bacteremia was assessed at
  3h (N) and 48h (O) post-infection. Mean ± SEM are shown for body weight (M). *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 by a log-rank Mantel–Cox test for
  Kaplan–Meier survival plots or otherwise determined by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
  post-hoc multiple comparison test.
