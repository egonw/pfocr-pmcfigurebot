caption: 'MET regulates the energy metabolic disturbances caused by gas explosions.
  (A) Changes in ATP content in lung tissue. Changes in (B) α-KGDH, (C) ICDHm and
  (D) PFK activity in lung tissue. n=8. *P<0.05 compared with the control group; #P<0.05
  compared with the BLI group. ICDHm, micro isocitrate dehydrogenase mitochondrial;
  α-KGDH, micro α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; BLI, blast
  lung injury; MET, metformin.'
article_title: Metformin mitigates gas explosion-induced blast lung injuries through
  AMPK-mediated energy metabolism and NOX2-related oxidation pathway in rats.
