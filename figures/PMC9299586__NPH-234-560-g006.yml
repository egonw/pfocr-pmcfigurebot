caption: 'Comparison on auxin signalling and sugar signalling pathway in wild‐type
  (WT) and Slpif3‐6 tomato anthers. Venn diagram (a) and KEGG analysis (b) of differentially
  expressed genes in WT and Slpif3‐6 anthers. III, at microspore stage; V, at bicellular
  pollen stage. (c, e) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the
  expression levels of auxin‐related and sugar‐related genes. The levels of gene expression
  normalised to Ubiquitin expression are shown relative to the WT level set to 1.
  Individual values (dots) and means (bars) are shown with three independent biological
  replicates, each error bar represents the mean ± standard deviation. Asterisks indicate
  significant differences between Slpif3‐6 and WT plants. (d) Indole‐3‐acetic acid
  (IAA) levels in anthers of Slpif3‐6 were diminished in comparison to WT. Individual
  values (dots) and means (bars) are shown with four independent biological replicates,
  each error bar represents the mean ± SD. Asterisks indicate significant differences
  between Slpif3‐6 and WT plants. (f) Fructose, glucose and sucrose content in WT
  and Slpif3‐6 anthers. Individual values (dots) and means (bars) are shown with four
  independent biological replicates, each error bar represents the mean ± SD. Asterisks
  indicate significant differences between Slpif3‐6 and WT plants. (g) Alexander staining
  of Slpif3‐6 pollen grains treated with 0, 10–5 or 10–4 mol l–1 IAA, respectively.
  (h) Percentage of viable pollen by Alexander staining. Individual values (dots)
  and means (bars) are shown. Each error bar represents the mean ± SE, n = 8 biologically
  independent samples. Each replicate included at least 200 pollen grains. Asterisks
  indicate significant differences between Slpif3‐6 and WT plants. P‐values in (c–f,
  h) were calculated using two‐tailed Student’s t‐test: **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.
