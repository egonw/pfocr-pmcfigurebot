caption: Functional enrichment analysis of ferroptosis-related DEGs. (A) GO analysis
  results showed the enriched biological processes, cell components, and molecular
  functions associated with DEGs. (B) KEGG pathway analysis results showed the enriched
  signaling pathways associated with DEGs. NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function;
  HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; DEG, differentially expressed gene; GO, Gene
  Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
