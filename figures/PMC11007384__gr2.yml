caption: Organization and confirmation of the mom biosynthetic gene cluster. a) Organization
  of the mom gene cluster. The proposed gene functions are listed in  b) Schematic
  construction of the momU disruption mutant MU01U. c) Confirmation of the momU disruption
  mutant MU01U by analyzing PCR products on an agarose gel electrophoresis. Lane 1,
  PCR product from a primer pair PverUF and PverUR with the wild type gDNA, Lane 3,
  PCR product from a primer pair PverUF and PverpYR with the wild type gDNA, Lane
  4, PCR product with a primer pair PverpYF and PverUR with the wild type gDNA. Lanes
  2, 5, and 6 are the same as lanes 1, 3, and 4 but with the mutant MU01U gDNA; M,
  10 kb ladder. d) LC-MS analysis (extracted ion chromatograms of m/z [M − H]- 1299.6
  corresponding to MOMA) of Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0244) wild type (indicated with
  WT) and the mutant MU03U.
