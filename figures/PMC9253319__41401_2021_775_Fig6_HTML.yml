figure_title: FTS-IR783 directly bound with and activated AMPK and subsequently regulated
  TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway
caption: a The affinities of FTS-IR783 and mTOR, Ras, Akt, AMPKα, AMPKβ, and GSK3β
  were detected by pull-down assay, respectively. b The binding of FTS-IR783 with
  AMPK was analyzed by molecular docking, the size of space was set as 45 × 45 × 45
  point and other parameter was performed with default of the docking software. Binding
  energy was displayed. The binding affinities of FTS-IR783 to AMPKα and AMPKβ (c),
  Ras, Akt, GSK3β, and mTOR (d) were evaluated using CETSA, the melting curves were
  fitted by Graphpad with Boltzmann sigmoidal. The binding affinities of FTS to AMPKα
  and AMPKβ were evaluated using pull-down assay (e) and CETSA (f), the melting curves
  were fitted by Graphpad with Boltzmann sigmoidal. g Effects of FTS and FTS-IR783
  on the in-situ expressions of phospho-AMPKα. h The protein expressions of AMPKα,
  p-AMPKα, AMPKβ, p-AMPKβ, TSC2, and p-TSC2 were detected in MDA-MB-231 cells using
  Western blotting after FTS-IR783 (1, 2, 4 μM) treatments for 48 h. i The protein
  expressions of AMPKα, p-AMPKα, AMPKβ, p-AMPKβ, TSC2, and p-TSC2 were detected in
  tumor tissue after 15 and 30 mg · kg−1 FTS-IR783 treatments for 14 days. j Effects
  of AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin on cell viability in MDA-MB-231 cells were observed
  after dorsomorphin (300 nM) and FTS-IR783 (4 μM) for 48 h. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  and ***P < 0.001 vs. Model or Ctrl (control). &P < 0.05, &&&P < 0.001 vs. FTS-IR783,
  by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. The data were shown as Mean ± SD. k Effects
  of AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin on AMPKα, p-AMPKα, AMPKβ, p-AMPKβ, mTOR, p-mTOR2448,
  p-mTOR2481, p70S6K, and p-p70S6K expressions.
