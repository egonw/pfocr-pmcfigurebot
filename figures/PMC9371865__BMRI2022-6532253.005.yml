caption: LTBP2 regulates the expressions of p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway proteins.
  (a, b) The level of Nrf2 proteins was significantly reduced after silencing LTBP2.
  (a, c, d) When LTBP2 was silenced, Keap1 expression was significantly increased
  and P62 expression was correspondingly decreased. Quantitative data are presented
  as mean s ± SD from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs. the control.
