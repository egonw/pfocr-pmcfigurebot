caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs between U251 and maslinic
  acid-treated U251. (a) The cluster heat map of the first 100 DEGs in the U251 and
  maslinic acid-treated U251 datasets. The abscissa indicates the number of samples,
  whereas the ordinate indicates DEGs. The histogram in the upper right corner represents
  the color level; each rectangle corresponds to the expression value of a sample.
  (b) GO term of Top 25, Top 15, and Top 10. According to the number of differential
  genes annotated to GO Term, they were arranged in descending order, showing the
  distribution of the number of significantly different genes in GO Term enriched
  in biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. (c, d) GO enrichment
  analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in U251 cells post maslinic
  acid treatment. The results showed the GO Term and pathway of the top 20 enriched
  significantly in the form of a scatter plot.
