caption: 'Interfering H1R expression in bEnd.3 cells decreased cell inflammation response.
  (A) Expression levels of TLR2/4-MAPK signaling pathway proteins were checked by
  Western blot after bEnd.3 cells were transfected with H1R siRNA (n=3). (B) Expression
  levels of TLR2/4-MAPK signaling pathway proteins were quantified and normalized
  to GAPDH levels after bEnd.3 cells were transfected with H1R siRNA (n=3). (C) Abundance
  of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10 in medium supernatant was examined by ELISA after
  bEnd.3 cells were transfected with H1R siRNA (n=3). H1R: histamine 1 receptor, TLR:
  Toll-like receptor, MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinases. (ns, no significance,
  *p <0.05, ** p <0.01, *** p <0.001).'
