caption: ω-6 vs. ω-3 increased retinal neuronal metabolism identified with single-cell
  analysis. The higher expression of genes (top 20) in the rod and cone cluster of
  ω-6 vs ω-3 diet-fed Phase I ROP mice were associated with energy production related
  gene ontology terms. The higher expression of genes in the bipolar cell cluster
  of ω-6 versus ω-3 LCPUFA-fed Phase I ROP mice were associated with purine ribonucleotide
  (components of DNA, RNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP),
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH),
  and coenzyme A) metabolic and biosynthetic process related gene ontology terms.
  The higher expression of genes in the amacrine cell cluster of ω-6 versus ω-3 LCPUFA-fed
  Phase I ROP mice were associated with energy production related gene ontology terms.
  Adjusted p-values for enriched gene ontology (GO) terms are shown in bar graphs
  (p < 0.05). Gene ratio for each pathway is shown in heatmap.
