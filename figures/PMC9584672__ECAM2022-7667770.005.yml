caption: 'Effect of AMPK inhibition on PF-mediated Nrf2 signaling pathway activation
  in H/R induced H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells were exposed to H/R damage after being treated
  with PF in the presence of Compound C (10 M). (a) Western blot analysis of AMPK
  and Nrf2 nuclear protein expression. (b-c) P-AMPK and Nrf2 quantification analysis.
  (d) Cell viability in H9c2 cells. (e) ROS generation in H9c2 cells. (f) Caspase-3
  activity in H9c2 cells, ∗P < 0.05 vs. control. #P < 0.05 vs. H/R, $P < 0.05 vs.
  H/R + PF group.'
