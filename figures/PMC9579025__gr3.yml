caption: Differential gene expression upon 6-OHDA lesion in WT and iMSN-D2RKO DLS(A)
  Volcano plot based on the −log10 adjusted p value versus the log2FC of the DLS transcriptome
  (6-OHDA vs sham mice in both genotype). Cut-offs are shown as dotted lines (p-adj < 0.01)
  and log2FC ± 20%.(B) Venn-diagram representing the common and the exclusive genes
  of the two differential expression analyses (6-OHDA WT vs sham WT and 6-OHDA iMSN-D2RKO
  vs sham iMSN-D2RKO mice).(C) Heatmap representing the single mouse z-score of the
  236 statistically significant common genes shown in B, adjusted p value > 0.1.(D)
  KEGG pathway analysis of the 236 statistically significant common genes shown in
  B. All pathways are significant for p value <0.05 (shown as -Log10), the numbers
  in brackets represent the number of genes for each pathway. See also  and  and .
