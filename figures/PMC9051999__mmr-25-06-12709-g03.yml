caption: 'Effect of SERP1 overexpression on endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein
  expression and GSK3β/β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling in hepatocytes. (A) Expression
  levels of GRP78, GRP94 and CHOP in hepatocytes detected by western blotting. (B)
  TOP Flash/FOP Flash fluorescent gene reporter assay to detect TCF/LEF activity.
  (C) GSK3β/β-catenin expression was detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs.
  the control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + NC; ΔΔΔP<0.001 vs. LPS + SERP1;
  n≥3. SERP1, stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1; GRP78, glucose-regulated
  protein 78; GRP94, glucose-regulated protein 94; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid
  enhancing factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NC, negative control.'
