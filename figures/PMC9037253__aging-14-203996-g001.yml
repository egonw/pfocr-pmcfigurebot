caption: Analysis of circ_6014 in breast cancer. (A) Relative expression of the host
  gene circ_6014 in breast cancer according to ENCORI. (B–D) Kaplan-Meier survival
  curve showed higher ILKAP expression indicated worse patient prognosis in GSE10885
  (B), GSE10893 (C), and GSE2741 databases (D). (E) Relative expression of ILKAP in
  breast cancer and adjacent noncancer tissues. (F) The simplified graphic of the
  spliced location of circ_6014 from its host gene and the 6-10 exons that constituted
  this circRNA. (G) The positive linear correlation between the mRNA level of ILKAP
  and the expression level of circ_6014 in breast cancer tissues. (H) circ_6014 was
  more highly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancer tissues.
  (I) Relative expression of circ_6014 between the patients’ preoperative and postoperative
  plasma and downregulation of its expression after the operation. (J, K) Relative
  abundance of circ_6014 and its host gene ILKAP under treatment with actinomycin
  D for different times. The abundance of ILKAP decreased, while that of circ_6014
  remained invariant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
