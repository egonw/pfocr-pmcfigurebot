caption: Schematic depiction of mechanisms of diclofenac-mediated apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest. Diclofenac is found to obstruct cell cycle in different cell lines,
  such as neural stem cells, human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLEC), osteoblasts,
  glioblastomas (GBM), ovarian cells, and VSMC. Studies found an upregulation of cell
  cycle inhibitory proteins, such as p27, p21, and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase
  (15-PGDH), and downregulation of inducers of cell proliferation, such as E2F1 transcription
  factor and cyclin D1, all crucial factors responsible for causing cell cycle arrest
  after diclofenac treatment. Diclofenac has also been shown to have pro-apoptotic
  effects. The major downstream mechanisms that have been thought to be the reason
  for diclofenac-mediated apoptosis includes ROS-induced downregulation of the PI
  3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, inhibition of NF-kB activity, disturbance in proteasome
  activity, interference with COX enzyme activity, and induction of the JNK pathway
  via AP1 transcription factors. The activation/formation and inhibition are depicted
  with arrows and blunt heads, respectively. The upward and downward small arrows
  in bold depicts elevation and depletion in corresponding proteins or pathway. The
  bold arrows or blunt ends (on top left and right sections) points to downstream
  proteins or cancer types, respectively indicating the effect of diclofenac. The
  normal arrows or blunt ends in lower section represents individual pathways known
  to be involved in diclofenac mediated apoptosis.
