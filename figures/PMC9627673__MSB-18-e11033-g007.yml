caption: 'Inference of pathway score, a proxy for pathway activity, for 49 KEGG metabolic
  pathways. Hierarchical clustering of: (above) cell lines, colored by their tissue
  of origin and the batch they were grown in, (side) metabolic pathways, colored by
  their pathway class (cell lines n = 180, three biological replicates and two technical
  per cell line averaged).'
