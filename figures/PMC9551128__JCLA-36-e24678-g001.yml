caption: ICAT interacts with JUP in CRC cells. (A) SDS‐PAGE separation and silver
  staining of the immunoprecipitated proteins obtained from SW480 cells infected with
  lentiviruses containing ICAT‐expressing vector tagged with Flag or empty vector.
  The target lane was excised and analyzed using LC–MS/MS analysis. (B) Interaction
  network of ICAT was analyzed using the STRING database. (C) Venn diagram of candidate
  ICAT‐interacting proteins between protein sets of LC–MS/MS analysis and STRING database.
  (D) Co‐IP was used to analyze the interaction between ICAT and JUP. (E) Double IF
  staining for ICAT and JUP in SW480 cell line was performed to observe their location
  status.
