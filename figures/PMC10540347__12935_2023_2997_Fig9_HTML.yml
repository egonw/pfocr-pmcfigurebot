caption: SQLE increases tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating
  the PTEN/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway through P53 in vivo. (A–B) Representative image
  of T24 xenograft tumors under different treatments; (C) Tumor weight in each group;
  (D) Tumor volume in each group; (E) Expression levels of P53, PTEN, P-AKT, P-GSK3β,
  cyclin D1, and Bcl2 of xenograft tumors in each group as determined by the western
  blot assay; (F) Expression of P-AKT, PTEN, P53, Cyclin D1 and Bcl2 in xenograft
  tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and TUNEL staining assays. The
  nucleus is blue and the brownish-yellow stain is positive; the darker the color,
  the higher the level of gene expression. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant)
