caption: SERPINA5 knockdown induces G0/G1 phase arrest and promotes apoptosis in GC
  cell lines. Cell cycle distribution of si‐CON and si‐SERPINA5 transfected (A) MKN‐28
  and (B) BGC‐823 cells as determined by flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis detection
  of si‐CON and si‐SERPINA5 transfected (C) MKN‐28 and (D) BGC‐823 cells as determined
  by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showing the expression of cell apoptosis
  and cycle‐related proteins in si‐CON or si‐SERPINA5 transfected (E) MKN‐28 and (F)
  BGC‐823 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
