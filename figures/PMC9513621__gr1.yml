  NPs. b Mechanism illustration of APTP NPs against melanoma-intrinsic tumor aggression.
  aPD-L1-adsorbed on the nanobraker actively target melanoma cells and blocking melanoma-PD-L1
  receptor. Then, the loaded mTOR inhibitor TAK228 was released to intercede the melanoma
  cell-intrinsic PD-1/PD-L1 interaction via dampening protumorigenic mTOR pathway.
  The inhibition of mTOR signaling was beneficial to downregulate protumorigenic cMYC
  and proangiogenic HIF-1Î±. Additionally, radiosensitizing high-Z metal Pt cooperating
  with TAK228 ameliorates radiotherapy to accelerate cell death. Besides, aPD-L1-adsorbed
  on the nanobraker blocked the lymphocyte-PD-1:melanoma-PD-L1 interaction to facilitate
  the effective infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
