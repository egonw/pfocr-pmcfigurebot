caption: TLR4 inhibition increased BTZ cytotoxicity by promoting oxidative stress
  coupled with mitophagy. (A) Representative dot plots of the effect of TAK-242, BTZ,
  and TAK-242/BTZ treatment on the viability of U266 and NCI-H929 cells are shown.
  The graphs (right panels) show the mean values of the percentage of apoptotic cells
  after annexin V–FITC and PI staining. (B) Reactive oxygen species production during
  drug treatment was measured in MM cell lines by the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
  (DCF-DA) using flow cytometry. (C) Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed
  by using DiOC2(3) staining. Representative histograms of a flow cytometry analysis
  are shown (left panels). (D) Flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial mass 24 h
  post-treatment was determined by using MitoTracker Red fluorescence. Representative
  histograms (left panels) are shown. Data are expressed as mean MFI ± SEM of n ≥
  4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
