caption: TLR4 inhibitor (TAK-242), at non-cytotoxic concentrations, reduces migration
  of pancreatic cancer cells expressing high level of TLR4 (BxPC-3). (A) Migration
  of BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells, and (B) cell viability of BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells measured
  after treated with TAK-242, a specific TLR4 inhibitor, at different concentrations
  for 24 h. Migration was presented as % of control, and cell viability was determined
  using WST-1 assay. Data are represented as mean ± SD from multiple replicates. The
  Jonckheere-Terpstra test was conducted to indicate the trend of cell migration’s
  change with increasing TAK-242 concentration after a significant multiple comparisons
  test (* p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared to control, obtained
  from one-way ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparisons with Dunnett correction). Scale
  bars, 50 μm.
