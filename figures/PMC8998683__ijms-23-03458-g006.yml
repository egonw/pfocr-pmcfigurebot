caption: 'Effect of NMN on the Sirt1/NF-κB P65/FN signaling pathway in MSC: (A) Representative
  of immunohistochemical staining of mice renal tissues. The percentage of NF-κB P65
  and ratio of acetylated P65/P65 stained area were calculated from 5 to 10 randomly
  images of each mouse. Scale bar = 20 μm. Western blot measured the dose effect of
  NMN on FN, Sirt1, NAMPT, and NMNAT1 expressions at an increasing dose gradient in
  MSC using (B) and measured Sirt1, FN, NF-κB P65, and acetylated P65 (AC-P65) incubated
  with or without NMN (0.5 mM) for MSC or transfected MSC, using β-actin as a control
  (C). * p ≤ 0.01, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
