caption: Significant pathways expressed in plasma from AD and MCI (compared with CN).
  The number of components of each pathway is presented as “Total metabolites” (grey
  bars) and the number of molecules matched to these pathways are presented as “Matched
  Metabolites” (blue bars). The “Impact” value represents the extent to which these
  pathways are impacted with the disease.
