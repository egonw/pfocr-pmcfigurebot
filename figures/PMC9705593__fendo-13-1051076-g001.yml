caption: Role of CD4+ T cell. Different sets of CD4+ T cells including Th1, Th2, Th17,
  Th22, Treg cells involve in the regulation of NASH and NASH-induced HCC mainly through
  secretion of cytokines and interaction with other cells. Th1 cells are featured
  with secretion of IFN-γ, which can further induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
  of hepatocyte, activation of kupffer cells (KCs), production of CXCL20 and chemotaxis
  of CXCR3+ T cells in a CXCL10-dependent manner, thus accelerating the evolution
  of NASH. The exact role of Th2 cells releasing IL-4/13/15 in NASH remains controversial,
  on one hand, they play an anti-inflammatory part in NASH, on the other hand, they
  aggravate fibrosis in NASH. Moreover, there still have some debate over the effect
  of Th17 cells on NASH. Th17 cells can secret IL-17 which result in recruitment of
  macrophages via releasement of CXCL10, activation of HSC, upregulation of pro-fibrotic
  genes and lipotoxic effect of FFAs in a JNK-dependent way, thus facilitating the
  development of NASH. However, several researches have demonstrated that functional
  blockade of IL-17 enhances NAFLD. Th22 cells characterized by release of IL-22 have
  been verified as a protective factor of NASH. Th22 cells can suppress lipotoxicity
  and inflammation through PI3K/Akt and STAT3 pathway respectively. What’s more, MT,
  an anti-oxidant enzyme, can be upregulated by Th22 cells which further restrains
  hepatic oxidative stress and inflammatory function of hepatocyte-derived extra cellular
  vesicles. Meanwhile, Th22 cells involve in upregulation of anti-apoptosis genes
  and downregulation of genes associated with lipid biosynthesis. Treg cells play
  a complex role in NASH, they can not only promote fibrosis through release of TGF-β,
  but also inhibit fibrosis via secretion of IL-10. Treg cells lead to exacerbation
  of NASH-induced HCC through suppression of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and Th1
  cells. Th1 cells have been identified as anti-tumor cells through release of IFN-γ,
  meanwhile Th17 cells have been recognized as pro-tumor cells in NASH-induced HCC.
  However, a recent study indicated that a predominant Th1 inflammatory pattern contributes
  to HCC while shifting to a Th17 inflammatory pattern inhibits tumor progression.
  The exact role of each subset of CD4+ T cells in NASH and NASH-induced HCC need
  further investigation.
