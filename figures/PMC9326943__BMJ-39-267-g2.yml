caption: FLOT2 aggravated CC cell proliferation. (a-c) The level of FLOT2 was tested
  via RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. The overexpression and knockdown efficiencies
  were confirmed. (d-e) CCK-8 was used to examine the viability and proliferation
  of CC. Cell proliferation was enhanced after overexpressing FLOT2 and reduced after
  silencing FLOT2. (f) The apoptosis of CC cells was detected by flow cytometry. Cell
  apoptosis decreased after overexpressing FLOT2 and increased after silencing FLOT2.
