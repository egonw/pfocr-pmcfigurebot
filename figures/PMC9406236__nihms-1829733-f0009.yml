figure_title: Geneset enrichment analysis for Tres gene scores
caption: a, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), an example on αβ T cell proliferation.
  X-axis presents the gene ranked by median Tres scores (bottom Y-axis) across all
  tumors and immunosuppressive signals. Y-axis on the top presents enrichment scores
  at each gene rank. The P-value is computed through the two-sided permutation test
  (n = 1000 randomizations). HLA-E is the first gene annotated in the pathway. b,
  Top-three enriched biological processes. For each cancer type, enrichment of gene
  ontology pathways was analyzed for median Tres scores among all patients. Top-three
  enriched and depleted pathways for Tres scores related to TGF-β1, TRAIL and PGE2
  signaling were shown together. c, Tres scores of non-classical MHC class I molecules.
  Each dot represents a value from a tumor. Tres scores computed for each signal are
  shown through violin plots smoothed by a kernel density estimator (n = 139, 137,
  132 for TGF-β1, TRAIL, PGE2 groups). P-values were from the two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test comparing group values and zero.
