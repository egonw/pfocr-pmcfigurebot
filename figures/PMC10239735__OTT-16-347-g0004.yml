caption: JUND regulated multiple processes and pathways involved in cervical cancer.
  (A) Differential expressed genes of the JUND-KO pool. The levels of JUND are indicated
  with a white line. (B) Enriched KEGG pathway analysis of differential expressed
  genes in JUND-KO pool group (C) Enriched GO biological process of up-regulated genes
  (Orange) and down-regulated genes (blue) in JUND-KO pool. The X-axis of histogram
  is âˆ’log10(P value) of individual terms calculated by right-sided hypergeometric
  test and corrected with Bonferroni. GO categories are indicated on Y-axis.
