caption: 'Effects of PCNP on the apoptosis and MAPK signaling pathway in human thyroid
  cancer cells. a The apoptotic levels of TPC-1 and ARO cells were measured by TdT-mediated
  dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining; original magnification100 ×. b The
  percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were calculated. c Western blotting analysis
  for the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK, p-P38 and P38 in TPC-1 and ARO
  cells. GAPDH was used as the loading control. d The densitometry analyses of p-ERK1/2,
  ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK, p-P38 and P38 were performed in TPC-1 and ARO cells, normalized
  to the corresponding GAPDH level. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiments; **P < 0.01 compared with the Mock group; ##P < 0.01 compared with the
  sh-Scb group.'
