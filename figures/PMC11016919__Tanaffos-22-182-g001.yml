caption: 'Trimetazidine: possible mechanisms of neuroprotection in Covid-19-induced
  stroke. A) Trimetazidine inhibits mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase,
  thereby decreasing oxidation of long-chain fatty acid, but not glycolysis in the
  myocardium. The decreased long-chain fatty acid Î²-oxidation is compensated by increased
  use of glucose, preventing a lowered myocardial pH, and modulating energy saving.
  B) Trimetazidine promotes Mir-21, which leads to neuroprotection by inhibiting the
  PI3/PTEN signaling pathway and preventing the activation of AKT/CREB/BDNF. C) Trimetazidine
  inhibits ROS and NOS production.PDH: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase, PTEN: Phosphatase and
  tensin homolog, PI3: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, AKT: protein kinase B, CREB:
  cAMP response Element Binding Protein. BDNF: Brian Derived Neurotrophic Factor.
  ROS: Reactive Oxygen Species. NOS: Nitrogen-Oxygen species.'
