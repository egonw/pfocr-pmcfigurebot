caption: 'Effect of silk protein (SP) administration on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  in old mice. (A) Serum concentration of IGF-1 (mean ± SEM; n = 4). Expression levels
  of intermediates in the Akt/mTOR pathway, measured using Western blot analysis,
  in the (B) QUA and (C) GAS muscles GAPDH was used as a loading control and the phosphorylation
  of the intermediates was normalized to the total expression of the relevant proteins.
  Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (p < 0.05; one-way
  ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test): a > b > c > d.'
