caption: The signaling pathways connected to autophagy. The phosphatidylinositol signaling
  pathway is regulated by Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and PI3Ks are
  linked to an extraordinarily diverse group of cellular functions through regulation
  of the Akt/TSC1-TSC2/mTOR pathway. The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene
  negatively regulates both glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) and Akt. Wnt signaling
  activation is mediated through the binding of a Wnt-protein ligand to a frizzled
  family receptor, which passes the biological signal to disheveled (Dsh). Dsh negatively
  regulates GSK3β, which alternatively inhibits β-catenin, one of the central proteins
  of the Wnt signaling pathway. Reproduced from Polajnar and Žerovnik ().
