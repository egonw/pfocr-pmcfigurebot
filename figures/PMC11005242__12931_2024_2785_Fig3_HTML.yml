caption: GLUT3 increased in mice exposed to CS and BEAS-2B cells treated with CSE.
  (A) and (B) Western blot showed the expression levels of GLUT3 and GAPDH in the
  lungs of mice exposed to air (n = 3) and CS (n = 3). (C) and (D) Representative
  GLUT3 immunostaining (brown staining) was performed in the airways of mice exposed
  to air (n = 3) and CS (n = 3), Scale bars, 100 μm(up). (E) and (F) Western blot
  detected the time course of GLUT3 expression in the 5% CSE response. (G) Immunofluorescence
  results showed that after 48 h of treatment with 5% CSE in BEAS-2B cells, GLUT3
  protein expression was enhanced, scale bar, 100 μm. The data are the mean ± SD.
