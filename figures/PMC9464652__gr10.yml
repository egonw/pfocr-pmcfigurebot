caption: Immune cell landscape and the ability of the PGSscore to predict the response
  to immunotherapy. (A) Lollipop plot showing the Spearman correlation between PGSscore
  and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in TCGA cohort. (B) The expression of immune
  checkpoint genes between the low- and high-PGSscore groups in TCGA cohort. (C) The
  relationship between IPS and PGSscore in TCGA cohort. The line in each box represents
  the median value (Wilcoxon test). (D) TIDE scores between low- and high-PGSscore
  groups in TCGA cohort. (E) PGSscores between non-responsive and responsive immunotherapy
  groups in the GSE67501 dataset. (F) The distribution of low- and high-PGSscore groups
  in the non-responsive and responsive groups in the GSE67501 dataset. (G) Survival
  analysis of low- and high-PGSscore groups in the IMvigor210 cohort. Kaplan-Meier
  survival curve revealed significant differences between the groups (log-rank test,
  p = 0.033). (H) Differences in PGSscores of the complete response/partial response
  group and stable disease/progressive disease group in the IMvigor210 cohort. (I)
  The proportion of low- and high-PGSscore groups in the response/partial response
  and stable disease/progressive disease groups in the IMvigor210 cohort. The line
  in each box represents the median value. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; Wilcoxon
  test.
