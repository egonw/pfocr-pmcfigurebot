caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment plot. The GO (A) and KEGG (B) enrichment plots
  were constructed by TBtools. Both GO and KEGG enrichment p-value of pathways were
  verified by the BH method. In addition, the bubble plots used the bubble shiny plugin
  (C,D). The circle color represented the enrichment degree, and the size of the circle
  represented the differential genes participating in a certain pathway.
