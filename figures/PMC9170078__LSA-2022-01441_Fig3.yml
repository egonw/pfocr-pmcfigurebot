figure_title: RibD is required for MAIT cell activation
caption: (A) Growth curve of the indicated strains after culture with shaking shows
  no difference in change in optical density over time. (B) Plots show normalized
  read counts of genes in the riboflavin synthetic pathway in free-living parental
  FN or FN∆ribD strains. (C, D, E, F) GFP-reporter activities of cells expressing
  human (C, E) and mouse (D, F) MAIT TCR after stimulation with escalating amounts
  (1, 3, 9 μl) (C, D) or 9 μl (E, F) of total metabolites from FN, FN∆ribD, FNribDFT,
  FNribDFT (56, 61, 62), FNribDFT (80), and FNribDFT (254) strains cultured in the
  presence of human or mouse MR1-expressing cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  by one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Data are representative
  of three independent experiments.
