caption: TFEB provokes metabolic anergy in MYC-induced B cell lymphoma. A-G, Differential
  and statistically significant metabolites and genes (p ≤ 0.1 and p ≤ 0.05, respectively),
  were grouped based on the indicated KEGG metabolic pathways, and are illustrated
  as two-axis dot plots to show the metabolite abundance (left-axis of plots) and
  changes in mRNA expression (right-axis of plots) that are up-regulated or down-regulated
  following the induction of TFEB activity in Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells. H, Untargeted
  metabolomic profiling via LC-MS/MS was performed in Eμ-Myc lymphoma expressing vector
  or TFEBSA-ERT2 after treatment with vehicle or 4-OHT for 4 days (n = 4). LC-MS spectra
  was analyzed using MZMine2. These data were then uploaded into MetaboAnalyst, and
  samples were normalized by the sum of all metabolites and log2 transformed, followed
  by a functional enrichment analysis to assess metabolic pathway enrichment using
  MetaboAnalyst. I, Normalized log2 transformed metabolomic data from Eμ-Myc lymphoma
  expressing TFEBSA-ERT2 treated with vehicle or 4-OHT were uploaded to GeneGo MetaCore
  to assess metabolic pathways affected by TFEB activation.
