caption: TMEM44‐AS1 is upregulated in 5‐FU‐resistant GC cell lines. A) Sketch map
  of 5‐FU‐resistant cell line construction. B) The IC50 value for 5‐FU was detected
  for both sensitive and 5‐FU‐resistant cells through CCK‐8 assay. C) After 5‐FU treatment
  (5 µg mL−1) for 48 h, the 5‐FU‐resistant and sensitive cell viability was analyzed
  through CCK‐8 assay. D) 5 µg mL−1 5‐FU was used to treat cells for a 48 h period,
  following which proliferative ability of both 5‐FU‐resistant and sensitive cells
  was assessed through EdU assay. Scale bar, 20 µm. E) 5 µg mL−1 5‐FU was used to
  treat cells for a 48 h period, and then we measured cell apoptosis rate for both
  sensitive and resistant cells through flow cytometry. F) Western blot analysis of
  the expression of ABCC1, ABCG2, Survivin, Caspase3, and cleaved caspase‐3 after
  5 µg mL−1 5‐FU treatment for 48 h. G) The heatmap shows the 50 most significantly
  upregulated and downregulated RNAs in MKN‐45/R and HGC‐27/R cells when relative
  to their respective sensitive cells as determined by transcriptome sequencing. H)
  Venn plot showing two data sets. Overlapped RNAs upon |log2 (fold change, FC)| ≥1
  and P ≤ 0.05 were selected. I) RT‐qPCR analysis on expression levels of overlapping
  lncRNAs. J) 5‐FU treatment could induce upregulation of TMEM44‐AS1 in sensitive
  cell lines. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
