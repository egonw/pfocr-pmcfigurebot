caption: 'Intercellular communications and metabolic reprogramming as new predictive
  markers for immunotherapy responses in gastric cancer. (A) Boxplot of seven metabolic
  signatures related to immunotherapeutic responses in responders and non‐responders
  in the SMC cohort (n = 45). (B) Metabolic pathways that differed significantly between
  responders and non‐responders in the SMC dataset, among the 84 metabolic pathways
  studied. (C) Fractions of predicted responders and non‐responders according to the
  molecular subtypes in the Yonsei cohort (n = 497). (D) UMAP plot of patient identification
  numbers from the gastric tumor dataset. (E) UMAP plot of 8 cell types for 8 samples
  from the gastric tumor dataset. (F) Bar graph showing fractions of predicted responders
  and non‐responders in the gastric tumor dataset according to the 8 cell types. (G)
  Heat map of the activities of seven metabolic signatures between cells from responder
  and non‐responder samples. (H) Boxplot of seven metabolic signatures related to
  immunotherapeutic responses using scRNA‐seq data of adenocarcinoma cells from responder
  and non‐responder samples. (I) Heat map of the top‐ranked cancer hallmark signatures
  among 50 cancer hallmark pathways in adenocarcinoma cells from responder and non‐responder
  samples. (J) Seven metabolic signatures between macrophages from responders and
  non‐responders using scRNA‐seq data. (K) Heat map of 84 metabolic pathways in macrophages
  from responder and non‐responder samples. (L) Boxplot of the seven metabolic signatures
  between T cells from responders and non‐responders using scRNA‐seq data. (M) Heat
  map of 84 metabolic pathways in T cells from responder and non‐responder samples.
  (N) tSNE plot of stem‐like T cell trajectories using VarID and StemID (blue: high
  entropy; red: low entropy). Cluster 2 has the highest entropy, and cluster 3 has
  the lowest entropy. Since the entropy shows the direction from high to low, the
  metabolic pathway activity on the left is significantly different between the two
  clusters. Oxidative phosphorylation, one carbon pool by folate, and sulfur metabolism
  are also significantly different between cluster 2 and cluster 3. (O) Heat map of
  prior interaction potential between prioritized T cell ligands and receptors expressed
  by macrophages. (P) Bar plot of Pearson correlation between C5AR1 and top three
  genes in the glycerolipid, glutathione, and nitrogen metabolic pathways in responders
  and non‐responders from the SMC cohort. (Q) Kaplan‐Meier overall survival curves
  of the patients with high and low expression of AKR1B1 in TCGA STAD dataset. (R)
  Boxplot of AKR1B1 expression in responders and non‐responders from the Yonsei cohort
  (P < 0.001). Abbreviations: SMC, Samsung Medical Center; TCA,tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; UMAP, Uniform manifold approximation and projection; scRNA‐seq, single‐cell
  RNA‐sequencing; tSNE, t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding; TCGA, The Cancer
