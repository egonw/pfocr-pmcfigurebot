caption: Inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cell lines
  by (+)-ABX. A Chemical structure of (+)-ABX. B Determination of IC50 values using
  CCK-8 assay. C Morphological changes in cells treated with various concentrations
  of (+)-ABX for 24 h. D Colony formation of NSCLC cells after treatment with different
  concentrations of (+)-ABX. Colony-forming ability was quantified by counting colonies
  per well. E Measurement of wound healing in NSCLC cells after (+)-ABX treatment.
  F Assessment of transwell migration and invasion of NSCLC cells after (+)-ABX treatment.
  G Quantitative analysis of wound healing, transwell migration, and invasion assays.
  The bar graphs represent mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments; *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared with the control group
