caption: 'PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway was involved in the regulation of mitophagy
  by vitamin K2. (A) Measurement of PINK1 and Parkin mRNA expression changes by RT-qPCR.
  (B) Changes in protein expression levels of PINK1 and Parkin detected by Western
  blot; images were quantified by using the ImageJ software. The data are presented
  as mean Â± SD (n = 3). Significant difference * p < 0.5 vs. control. (ns: no significance)'
