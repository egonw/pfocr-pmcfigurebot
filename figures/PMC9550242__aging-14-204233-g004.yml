caption: 'Fasudil restrained the YAP1/ETB/ETAsignaling pathway in arterial smooth
  muscle tissues of rabbits. (A) Immunofluorescence staining indicated decreased immunofluorescence
  of ETB in Fasudil group compared with that in Model group. P<0.05: Fasudil group
  vs. Model group. (B) Western blotting showed that Fasudil treatment inhibited the
  expressions of ETA and ETB proteins. (C–E) Co-expression analysis revealed that
  YAP1 was significantly correlated with EDN1 (ETA) and EDN2 (ETB) based on the data
  from the GSE60887 dataset. P<0.05: Fasudil group vs. Sham group. (F–H).'
