caption: 'Irisin stimulated the AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 signaling pathway in ASCs. (a) Representative
  images of p-AMPK, AMPK PGC-1α, and SIRT3 in each group after the indicated treatment,
  as determined by WB analysis. (b) The gene expression of the SIRT3 was determined
  by qPCR assay. (c) Effects of PGC-1α siRNA transfection on the AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3
  signaling pathway in irisin-treated ASCs under AGE stimulation, as determined by
  WB analysis. All results are representative of three independent experiments, and
  values are presented as mean ± SEM. Lv-Control: control lentivirus; Lv-shSIRT3:
  lentivirus-mediated SIRT3 knockdown; NC-siRNA: negative control-siRNA. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.'
