figure_title: CRC cell lines to model context‐dependent Wnt signaling in Wnt‐high
  and Wnt‐low tumors
caption: AColorectal cancer cell lines were ranked according to AXIN2 RNA expression
  and classified into Wnt‐high and Wnt‐low groups (Ghandi et al, ). Annotation of
  CMS for cell lines according to Zhan et al (). The horizontal line indicates the
  threshold for classification into Wnt‐low and Wnt‐high groups.BVolcano plot summarizing
  the results from differential gene expression analysis comparing Wnt‐low (n = 8
  cell lines) versus Wnt‐high (n = 39 cell lines) CRC cell lines. Gene expression
  data from RNA sequencing (Ghandi et al, ). Genes with higher expression in Wnt‐high
  cell lines have positive fold changes. The horizontal line indicates an adjusted
  P‐value threshold of 0.1, which was calculated as described in the  section. CTNNB1
  target genes (MsigDb pathway HALLMARK_WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING) are highlighted
  in blue. Gene set enrichment analysis for CTNNB1 target genes indicated a positive
  enrichment score with an adjusted P‐value < 0.01.C–FFrequency of cancer driver mutations
  in Wnt‐low (n = 8) and Wnt‐high (n = 39) CRC cell lines classified according to
  (A). The different cell lines represent independent biological replicates. P‐values
  from Fisher's exact test for independence are indicated. (C) Relative frequency
  of cell lines with 0, 1 or more truncating APC mutations in each of the groups.
  (D) Relative frequency of BRAF V600E (blue) or other BRAF missense mutations (black).
  (E) Relative frequency of missense mutations (gray), G659Vfs*41 (blue) and other
  truncating (black) mutations in the RNF43 protein. (F) Relative frequency of missense
  mutations at residues G12 or G13 (blue) or other residues (black) of the KRAS protein.GRelative
  frequency of cell lines with a given microsatellite stability status in Wnt‐low
  (n = 8) and Wnt‐high (n = 39) CRC cell lines classified according to (A). The different
  cell lines represent independent biological replicates. P‐value from Fisher's exact
  test for independence is indicated. MSI, microsatellite instable; MSI‐H, microsatellite
  instability high; MSI‐L, microsatellite instability low; MSS, microsatellite stable.
  Assignment of microsatellite stability status according to Zhan et al ().HIntroduction
  of APC truncations in RKO (Zhan et al, ) and HCT116 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Correct
  gene editing and successful APC truncation in single‐cell clones RKO‐APCtrunc#5
  and HCT116‐APCtrunc#2 was confirmed by targeted amplicon sequencing of the edited
  gene locus.IVolcano plot summarizing the results from differential gene expression
  analysis comparing RKO‐APCtrunc#5 versus RKO cell lines. Gene expression was assessed
  using microarrays in two biological replicates per cell line. The horizontal line
  indicates an adjusted P‐value threshold of 0.05, which was calculated as described
  in the  section. Genes with higher expression in RKO‐APCtrunc#5 cells have positive
  fold changes. Colors as in (B). Gene set enrichment analysis for CTNNB1 target genes
  indicated a positive enrichment score with a P‐value < 0.01 calculated.
