caption: Intestinal flora increases the anti-PD-1 therapeutic effect by regulating
  immune cells. Akkermansia muciniphila accelerated the activity of CXCR3+CCR9+CD4+T
  cells, produced more IFN-γ. Bacteroidales inhibited the infiltration of B cells
  and T cells. Bifidobacterium and Olsenella produced metabolites inosine and increase
  the levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon γ (IFN-γ), TNF-a and interleukin-2
  (IL-2). Bifidobacterium bifidum promotes the activation of T cells and B cells.
  Enterococcus faecium releases the metabolite SagA, produces NOD2 active polypeptide,
  and promotes the activation of B cells, T cells. Enterococcus hirae promotes tumor
  cell apoptosis, weakens the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, promotes
  the infiltration of T cells, B cells, promotes the activation of CD8+ T cells. Faecalibacterium
  promotes the activation of CD8+ T cells. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), induces
  IFN-β production, promotes CD8+ T cell activation via the cGAS/STING pathway in
  DC. Lactobacillus johnsonii enhances the immunotherapy effect through the metabolite
  hypoxanthine. Ruminococcaceae increases the number of effector T cells, induces
  the activation of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increases tumor CD8+ T cell infiltration.
