caption: '(A) Subcellular localization of 35S:GH3-2:GFP using rice protoplast 35S;
  green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a positive control. Left to right: green
  fluorescent protein of OsGH3-sGFP is shown in green color; red fluorescence shows
  RFP:HDEL (ER marker), bright field, and overlay microscope images. GH3s are most
  consistently localized to the ER membrane. Scale bars = 10 µm. (B) Protein interaction
  of GH3 and ipdc using rice protoplasts. Scale bars = 10 µm.'
article_title: Indole pyruvate decarboxylase gene regulates the auxin synthesis pathway
  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
