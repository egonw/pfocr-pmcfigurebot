caption: Atp13a1 potentiates antiviral immunity in mice. qPCR analysis of A) Ifnb,
  B) Isg54, C) Il‐6, D) Ifna4 induction in spleens from wild‐type, Atp13a1‐cKO and
  Mavs‐KO mice (n = 3) respectively, following infection for indicated time by intravenous
  injection of VSV (2 × 107 PFU per mouse). E) Ifnβ production in serum from mice
  after intravenous injection with VSV (2 × 107 PFU per mouse) measured by ELISA.
  F) qPCR analysis for VSV RNA in the spleen from samples as described in (A) (left)
  and viral titers of spleen following VSV infection for 12 h (right). G) Hematoxylin‐eosin
  staining of lung sections from the wild‐type and Atp13a1‐cKO mice. Scale bar represents
  100 micrometers. Survival of the wild‐type, Atp13a1‐cKO, and Mavs‐KO mice respectively
  after intravenous injection of H) VSV (5×107 PFU per mouse) or I) IAV (8×102 FFU
  per mouse). J) A schematic model illustrating functional involvement of ATP13A1
  in RIG‐I‐MAVS‐mediated antiviral signaling pathway. The figure was created in BioRender.com.
  Data are representative of three independent experiments with n = 3 (A–D,F), n = 6
  (H), n = 10 (I) technical replicates, each symbol represents an individual technical
  replicate (E) (shown as mean and SD in (A–D,F); shown as mean and SEM for plaque
  assay in (F)). p value was determined by two‐tailed unpaired Student's t‐test (A–F),
  two‐sided log‐rank (Mantel–Cox) test (H,I), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.
