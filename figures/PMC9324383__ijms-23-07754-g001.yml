caption: Panel (A) Metabolic set enrichment analysis showing the most altered metabolisms
  as revealed in the plasma of hypogonadal men before and after testosterone replacement
  treatment (TRT). Color intensity (white to red) reflects increasing statistical
  significance, while the circle diameter covaries with pathway impact. The graph
  was obtained by plotting −log of p-values from pathway enrichment analysis on the
  y-axis and the pathway impact values derived from pathway topology analysis on the
  x-axis. Panel (B) Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA). All the matched pathways are
  displayed as circles. The color and size of each circle is based on the p-value
  and pathway impact value, respectively. The graph was obtained by plotting on the
  y-axis the −log of p values from the pathway enrichment analysis and on the x-axis
  the pathway impact values derived from the pathway topology analysis.
