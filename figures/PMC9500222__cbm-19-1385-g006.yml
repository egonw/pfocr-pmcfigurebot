caption: The K14R alteration increases binding of caspase-8 to FADD. (A, B) A549 and
  SPCA1 cell lines were transfected with rs3769823[A] or rs3769823[G]-expression plasmids.
  Then the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FADD antibody, followed
  by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-8.
article_title: A causal variant rs3769823 in 2q33.1 involved in apoptosis pathway
  leading to a decreased risk of non-small cell lung cancer.
