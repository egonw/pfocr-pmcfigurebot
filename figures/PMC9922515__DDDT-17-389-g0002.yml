caption: Solanine deactivates the AAMDC pathway of autophagy and promotes apoptosis
  in vivo. (A) Western blotting analysis showing the protein expression of cleaved
  Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, LC3, AAMDC, MYC, ATF4 and Sesn2. (B) The expression levels
  of ATF4 were determined using immunofluorescent microscopy. Data are expressed as
  the mean ± SD (n=3).
