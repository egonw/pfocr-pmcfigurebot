caption: Analysis of deoxyshikonin on cell apoptosis in U2OS and HOS cells. (A) U2OS
  and HOS were treated with deoxyshikonin (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μM) for 24 h and then
  subjected to flow cytometry after PI and Annexin V‐FITC/PI staining to analyse DNA
  contents. The cell cycle profile of flow cytometry was subsequently quantified.
  Cells that were considered viable were FITC Annexin V and PI negative; cells that
  were in early apoptosis were FITC Annexin V positive and PI negative; and cells
  that were in late apoptosis or already dead were both FITC Annexin V and PI positive.
  (B) Thereupon quantitative analysis of early apoptosis and late apoptosis was summed
  up to differentiate apoptosis from necrosis.
