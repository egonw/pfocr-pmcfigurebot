caption: 'HMOX1 product biliverdin suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication. A A schematic
  diagram showing the heme oxygenase pathway. Vero-E6 cells were infected with recombinant
  GFP-SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01. After incubation with virus for 1 h, the cells
  were treated with the indicated doses of Fe2+ (B) hemoglobin (HB) D or biliverdin
  (F) for 24 h. C, E, G The amount of viral RNA in the cell culture medium was quantified
  by real-time PCR assay. H Fluorescence microscopy images of GFP-SARS-CoV-2 in biliverdin-treated
  ACE2-HeLa cells. Blue: DAPI (nuclear staining). I The dose response curve of biliverdin
  against SARS-CoV-2. HeLa-ACE2 cells were infected with recombinant GFP-SARS-CoV-2.
  After incubation with virus for 1 h, the cells were treated with biliverdin at different
  concentrations for an additional 24 h. The viral NP expression in the SARS-CoV-2-infected
  cells was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to the expression of the 36B4
  gene. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD (error bar) of 3 independent experiments;
  asterisks represent statistical significance based on two-tailed unpaired Student’s
  t test (*P  <  0.05, **P  <  0.01)'
