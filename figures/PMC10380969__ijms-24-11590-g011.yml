caption: Proposed model of foxtail millet response to freezing stress. Under freezing
  stress, the cell membrane of foxtail millet senses external frozen signals, which
  are then transmitted to the nucleus by antioxidants. The BR signal, starch and sucrose
  metabolism, and many related transcription factors are induced to positively regulate
  plant freezing tolerance. Freezing damage results in the accumulation of starch,
  which in turn releases a portion of maltose. This maltose is then metabolized into
  sucrose and free hexose. Sucrose is subsequently transported to the leaves, where
  it enhances freezing resistance. Solid and broken arrows indicate activation and
  speculative regulation, respectively, whereas lines ending with a bar show negative
  regulation.
