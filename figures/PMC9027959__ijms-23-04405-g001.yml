caption: 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) protects against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced
  cytotoxicity in immortalized Fischer rat Schwann cells 1 (IFRS1). (a) Treatment
  with tBHP for 3 h decreased cell survival rate measured by MTT assay in IFRS1 cells
  whereas pretreatment with 10 μM DHA for 12 h significantly protected against tBHP-induced
  cytotoxicity. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of six experiments. **: p <
  0.01 compared with the BSA-control; ##: p < 0.01 compared with each tBHP concentration.
  (b) Cell morphology examined by phase-contrast microscopy. Scale bar: 50 μM. (c)
  Cell counts examined by microscopy. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three
  experiments. **: p < 0.01 compared with the BSA-control; ##: p < 0.01 compared with
  each tBHP concentration.'
