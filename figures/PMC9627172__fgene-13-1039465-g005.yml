caption: Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs in the low- and high-risk group. (A)
  Volcano diagram shows the DEGs with the threshold set at |FC| â‰¥ 2 and P-value <
  0.05. (B) GSVA analysis of hallmark signaling pathway for each ccRCC patient in
  the low- and high-risk group. (C) GO enrichment analysis shows the biological process
  of DEGs. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis shows the enrichment signaling pathways of
  DEGs.
