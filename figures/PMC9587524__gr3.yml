caption: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of UVA irradiation response
  genes in the grape skin. (a) Hierarchical cluster tree of the 31,448 common genes
  between different studies and the heatmap of 18 correlated metabolites enriched
  in flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. (b) Module-trait associations.
  The left panel shows the 9 modules. Each cell contains the corresponding correlation
  and p-value. (c) Co-expression network analysis of the hub genes in the turquoise
  module. Connection strength is represented by edge width. The topological overlap
  measure from the WGCNA was displayed using Cytoscape to illustrate the network.
