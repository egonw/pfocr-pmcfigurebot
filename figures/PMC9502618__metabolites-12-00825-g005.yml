caption: Effect of FFA treatment for 24 h on the expression of genes related to the
  AMPK signaling pathway in primary hepatocytes of laying hens. (A) Heatmap. The color
  indicates the gene expression level of log10 transformation (red indicates high
  expression level, green indicates low expression level). (B) Volcano plot. Gray
  dots indicate genes with no significant expression differences between groups under
  the dashed line, and colored dots above the dashed line indicate genes with significant
  expression differences between groups. Red indicates increased expression, while
  blue indicates decreased expression. Data are shown as the mean Â± SD (n = 6).
