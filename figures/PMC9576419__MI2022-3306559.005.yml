caption: Effects of JSH-23 on LPS-induced cardiac injury and dysfunction in mice.
  (a) The effects of JSH-23 on the survival rates of visfatin-treated septic mice
  were measured, N = 10 − 15 in each group. (b and c) Cardiac injury markers in the
  serum and heart were measured. (d–f) Cardiac structure and function in each group
  were measured. N = 5 − 10 in each group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the LPS + DMSO + VFT group.
  VFT means visfatin.
