caption: 'Bcl-2 protein inactivation and DNA damage demonstrated in cells exposed
  to 48 h action of azelastine hydrochloride. (A) Cells expressing Bcl-2 are clustered
  in the top two quadrants of the dot plot (inactivated and activated). Over 60% are
  dephosphorylated after treatment with azelastine at 60 µM and 90 µM, confirming
  inactivation of the Bcl-2 signaling pathway. (B) Azelastine at concentrations of
  15–90 µM generates DNA damage that induces DNA repair mechanisms such as ɣH2AX.
  (C) Azelastine concentration-dependent percentage of cells with double-stranded
  DNA damage and (D) percentage of cells with Bcl-2 protein inactivation. Data representative
  of three parallel experiments correspond to mean values ± standard error (SE). Differences
  were statistically confirmed at: *** p < 0.001.'
