caption: 'PTC-derived organoids as a platform for predicting drug responses. a Protocol
  for the treatment of PTC organoids with various anticancer drugs. Organoids were
  plated (10,000 organoids/mL) and cultured for 2 days, and drugs were diluted in
  organoid medium and added into each well with six-point fivefold dilution series
  (3.2 × 10–3 µM to 10 µM). After 5 days of treatment with the drugs, organoid viability
  was examined by using the CellTiter-Glo® 3D Reagent. b Simplified scheme of the
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway including targeted drugs used. c Heatmap of logIC50
  values for 13 anticancer drugs used to treat 9 PTC organoid lines by applying nonlinear
  regression. The corresponding colors for logIC50 are depicted in the legend. Orange
  indicates high IC50 values, violet indicates low IC50 values. The assay was performed
  with 3 biological replicates (different passages of PTC organoids). d Representative
  scatterplots of 1-AUC values generated from two biological replicates of the drug
  screening data. Each data point represents 1-AUC for a drug used to treat the indicated
  PTC organoids. Passage numbers of PTC organoid lines were: PTC-1_O, P3, P4 and P5;
  PTC-2_O, P2, P3 and P4; PTC-3_O, P3, P4 and P5; PTC-4_O, P3, P4 and P5; PTC-5_O,
  P3, P4 and P5; PTC-6_O, P3, P4 and P5; PTC-7_O, P4, P5 and P6; PTC-8_O, P3, P4 and
  P5; PTC-9_O, P4, P5 and P6'
