figure_title: Correlations between the ectomycorrhizal fungal community and tree growth
  rate across Europe
caption: Map showing the ICP Forests level II study plots with functional tree groups
  (broadleaf and needleleaf) and dominant tree species (>50% cover) separated by color
  (a). Correlation between tree growth and fungal community composition represented
  using principle coordinates analysis axis 1 (PCoA1; b; see functional tree group
  colors from panel a), fungal energy and nutrient metabolism genes (c), fungal organic
  N cycling genes (i.e. genes encoding for enzymes that EMF produce to access organic
  N, including peroxidases, multicopper oxidases, peptidases, and proteases (d), and
  the number of gene models identified in the fungal genome as an indicator of metabolic
  activity (e). Fungal energy and nutrient metabolism genes (i.e. ATP production,
  inorganic N metabolism) are a predefined KEGG metabolic pathway (Pathway 1.2) while
  organic N cycling genes were aggregated using PFAMs annotations. Gene proportions
  were calculated as the number of specific gene sequences relative to total gene
  numbers assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% sequence similarity)
  weighted based on relative taxon abundance (community weighted mean; CWM). Number
  of gene models was also calculated as a CWM trait value. Values show predicted tree
  growth while controlling for the influence of other covariates in the full statistical
  model (see Materials and Methods). Linear lines, confidence intervals (95%), and
  R2 values are displayed, and asterisks indicate significance (p ≤ 0.0001).
