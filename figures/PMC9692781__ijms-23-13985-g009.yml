caption: TE-NSP neuronal survival and axon architecture at 1-month post-implant in
  rat 6-OHDA lesion model of PD. (a) Representative confocal reconstruction of an
  enriched TE-NSP 1-month post-implant labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote dopaminergic
  neurons/axons (TH, red). The aggregate end of the TE-NSP was positioned in the SN
  while the axonal end of the TE-NSP terminated in the striatum. Implanted neurons
  and axons tracts were preserved in lesioned animals. Background has been increased
  to display the intact physical structure of the brain surrounding the implant and
  along its implantation path. (b) Representative confocal reconstruction of an enriched
  TE-NSP 1-month post-implant labeled via immunohistochemistry to denote GFP (GFP,
  green) and dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red). (c–e) Representative confocal reconstructions
  showing various types of implanted constructs at 1-month post-implant labeled via
  immunohistochemistry to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red). (c) Enriched
  TE-NSPs maintained their cytoarchitecture with discrete somata and axonal regions;
  they also demonstrated neurites spanning the full length of the micro-column. (d)
  Non-enriched TE-NSPs generally did not exhibit neurites spanning the length of the
  micro-column. (e) Enriched aggregates added to micro-columns 1 day prior to implant
  did not display long-distance neurite outgrowth within the micro-column. Scale bar
  (a) = 1 mm. Scale bar (b) = 250 µm. Scale bar (c) = 200 µm. Scale bar (d,e) = 100
  µm.
