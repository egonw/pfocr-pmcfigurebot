caption: 'Neurophysiology of motor control (left) and proteostasis regulation (right)
  in healthy midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons. In regular
  motor control, DA (synthesized from L-tyrosine) is encapsulated in synaptic vesicles
  by VMAT2. and then released to excite DA receptors D1R and D2R, thereby triggering
  the direct and indirect pathways of motor regulation, respectively. DA can spillover
  if not reuptaken by the neuron through the DAT. Free DA in the cytosol and the extracellular
  matrix can be oxidized by MAO-A into neurotoxic by-products. On the other hand,
  α-syn regulates the docking, fusion, and release of DA from synaptic vesicles are
  regulated. When the protein is misfolded, dopaminergic neurons eliminate it through
  the UPP or the ALP pathways. DA: dopamine; L-DOPA: levodopa; VMAT2: vesicular monoamine
  transporter 2; MAO-A: monoamine oxidase A; D1R: dopamine 1 receptor; D2R: dopamine
  2 receptor; DAT: dopamine transporter; α-syn: alpha-synuclein; NAC: non-amyloidogenic
  component; Ub: ubiquitin; UPP: ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; ALP: autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway. Figure made in BioRender.com.'
