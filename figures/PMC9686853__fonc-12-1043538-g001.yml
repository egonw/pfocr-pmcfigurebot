caption: Integrin α6β4 signaling sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment. BT549 cells
  expressing EV or wildtype integrin β4 (A) were treated with varying doses of cisplatin
  for 6 days. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assays (B) and IC50 was calculated
  (C) or relative clonogenic survival determined (D). (E, F) SUM159 cells with integrin
  β4 shRNA knockdown (shβ4) or control shRNA (shCont) (E) were treated with different
  doses of cisplatin and IC50 calculated from cell viability assays (F). (G, H) Mutant
  p53 was knocked down in a doxycycline-inducible manner in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or
  integrin β4 was knocked down by siRNA. Cells were then plated on laminin-1-coated
  plates, treated with various doses of cisplatin for 6 days. Efficiency of target
  knockdown was monitored by immunoblotting (G) and cell viability was assessed by
  MTT (H). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001.
