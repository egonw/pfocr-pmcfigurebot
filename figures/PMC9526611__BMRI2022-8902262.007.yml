caption: 'ZOMEC activated the p-Akt/Nrf-2 signaling pathway to decrease neurodegeneration
  and memory impairment. (a) Immunoblot results for p-Akt and Nrf-2 protein markers.
  (b) p-Akt histogram. (c) Nrf-2 histogram. (d) HO-1 histogram. (e) Binding mode and
  interaction of ZOMEC with p-Akt. (e) A: hydrophobic representation of p-Akt protein
  with bound ZOMEC shown in zoom view. B: p-Akt protein in ribbon representation with
  binding residues shown in yellow sticks and ZOMEC in red sticks. (f) Binding mode
  and interaction of ZOMEC with Nrf2. (f) A: hydrophobic representation of Nrf2 protein
  with bound ZOMEC shown in zoom view. B: Nrf2 protein in ribbon representation with
  binding residues shown in blue sticks and ZOMEC in red sticks. Significance: ###p
