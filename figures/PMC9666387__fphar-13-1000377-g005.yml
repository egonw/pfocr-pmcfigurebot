caption: The effect of sodium cantharidate (SCA) on breast cancer cells is related
  to the PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Experimental methods of mRNA sequencing
  analysis. (B) Volcano plot analysis of differentially expressed genes 24 h after
  SCA treatment. (C,D) Histogram and scatter plots of gene ontology enrichment of
  differentially expressed genes. (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
  enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. (F) Heatmap analysis of differentially
  expressed genes. Red and blue colors indicate relative expression above and below
  the average, respectively.
