caption: RAD9 deletion in RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz rescues the resistance to MMS. (A). Expression
  of RAD5 was analyzed in RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz-URA3 and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD5OE-URA3 using
  qPCR. (B). Expression of RAD5 was analyzed in BWP17-URA3 and RAD5 overexpression
  (RAD5OE-URA3) strain. (C). Growth of BWP17-URA3, RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz-URA3, RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD5OE-URA3,
  and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD9Hz-URA3 on YEPD plate. (D). Growth of BWP17-URA3, RAD5OE-URA3,
  and RAD9Hz-URA3 on YEPD plate. (E). Sensitivity of BWP17-URA3, RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz-URA3,
  RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD5OE-URA3, and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD9Hz-URA3 to MMS (0.02%) was
  evaluated using plate assays. (F). Sensitivity of BWP17-URA3, RAD5OE-URA3, and RAD9Hz-URA3
  to MMS (0.02%) was evaluated using plate assays. Growth curve of BWP17-URA3, RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz-URA3,
  RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD5OE-URA3, and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD9Hz-URA3 in the (G). absence
  and (H). presence of MMS (0.02%). (I). The expression of RAD59 was analyzed in RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz-URA3
  and RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz/RAD9Hz-URA3 strains using qPCR. (J). Expression of RAD59 was
  analyzed in BWP17-URA3 and RAD9Hz-URA3 strains using qPCR. The qPCR data are presented
  as average ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates. * p < 0.05. In the case of plate
  assays, five-fold serial dilutions were prepared and spotted on respective plates.
  The plates were incubated at 30 °C and imaged after 24 h.
