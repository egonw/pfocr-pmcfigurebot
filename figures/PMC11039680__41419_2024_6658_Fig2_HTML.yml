figure_title: RNA sequencing and organoid culture analysis reveal colonic stem cell
  dysfunction in Cldn-7 null mice
caption: 'A–D Normalised enrichment scores (NES) from GSEA and enrichment plots for
  intestinal stem cells, differentiated cells, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis
  transcriptional signatures of Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreERT2 and Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreW
  colonic tissues, respectively. E Heatmap showing the expression levels of established
  genes in Wnt signalling pathways, stem cells, and mature differentiated cells in
  either Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreERT2 or Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreW colonic tissues. F
  Differential expression analysis of Log2 fold change in stem cells and Wnt signalling
  pathway by Cldn-7 deficiency. G Representative images of colonic organoids derived
  from Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreERT2 and Cldn-7fl/fl;Villin-CreW mice (Left) from a minimum
  of three independent experiments; scale bars: 50 μm. The right panel shows the quantification
  of the average colonic organoid size on day 7 of the first passage. Organoids size
  was randomly measured in 50 organoids. H Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of marker
  genes for ISCs and differentiated cells in organoids derived from control mice and
  Cldn-7 knockout mice. (n = 3–4 per genotype). All images are representative of at
  least three independent experiments. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  All p values were calculated using Student’s t-test (two-tailed) or Mann–Whitney
  nonparametric test; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001, ns, not
  significant.'
