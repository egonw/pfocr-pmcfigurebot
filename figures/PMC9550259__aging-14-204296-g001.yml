caption: ZCCHC12 was upregulated in OS. (A) Differences in gene expression between
  OS and normal bone tissues represented by a volcano plot. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis
  indicated that PI3K/AKT signaling pathways had been significantly altered. (C) ZCCHC12
  expression was detected in OS cell lines by qRT-PCR. (D) Heatmap of differential
  gene expression in OS and normal bone tissues. n = 5; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
