caption: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor, causing
  autophosphorylation of its tyrosine residues. This causes phosphorylation of insulin
  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on its tyrosine residues, which leads to the phosphorylation
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling transduction cascade. PI3K
  catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) as a result, which in turn, phosphorylates the downstream
  protein “AKT”, which phosphorylates its substrate AS160. AS160 regulates glucose
  translocator 4 (GLUT4) and aids in its translocation to the plasma membrane, where
  it allows glucose to flow.
