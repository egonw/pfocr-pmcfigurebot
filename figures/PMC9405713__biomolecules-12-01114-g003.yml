caption: ZHPV16E7384 induced G1/S cell cycle arrest by interfering with the E7/Rb/E2F1/cyclin
  D1/CDK4 pathway. (A–C) A cell cycle analysis was performed to evaluate the effect
  of ZHPV16E7384 on the cell cycle. Cells treated with ZWT or PBS were used as the
  negative controls. (D) Cell cycle related proteins in cells with the same treatment
  as in (A–C) were analyzed by Western blot. The data shown are representative of
  three independent experiments. All experiments were performed in triplicate and
  data are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.
