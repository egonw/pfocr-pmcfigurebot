caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of MCF7 (10 µM), MDA-MB-231 (14 µM), and HCC1937
  (150 µM) cells following a seven-day exposure to olaparib. Enrichment analysis was
  based on the hypergeometric test. Topological analysis was based on betweenness
  centrality. The tight integration method was used by combining genes and metabolites
  into a single query. A p < 0.05, and pathway impact >0.1 were deemed significant.
