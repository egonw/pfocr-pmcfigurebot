caption: Changes in photosynthetic pigment synthesis in maize seedling leaves under
  phospholipase C inhibition. (A), chlorophyll content; (B), ALA content; (C), PBG
  content; (D), DEGs related to Glu-tRNA; (E), DEGs related to porphyrinogen; (F),
  DEGs related to chlorophyll; (G), DEGs related to chelatase; (H), chlorophyll synthesis
  pathway. The small circles represent the heat map of DEGs, and the numbers represent
  the fold change. Values are shown as mean Â± SD (n = 3 individuals per group). *
  means that the difference from the control reaches a significant level, p < 0.05.
