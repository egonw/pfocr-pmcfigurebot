caption: 'Degenerative changes was exhibited in temporomandibular condylar in the
  control and overloading groups in the 2wk、4wk、8wk group. A: Safranin-O and fast
  green staining (× 200). Gradual but significant loss of proteoglycan is observed
  in the 2wk、4wk、8wk group. In addition, chondrocytes were irregularly arranged and
  fibrillation were observed at different time points of rat condyles. B: Comparison
  of the OA score (including OARSI and Mankin score) between the groups. The OARSI
  and Mankin score are significantly higher in the overloading groups than in control
  groups from 2wk onwards (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'
article_title: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the progress of mandibular
  condylar cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss induced by overloaded
  functional orthopedic force (OFOF).
