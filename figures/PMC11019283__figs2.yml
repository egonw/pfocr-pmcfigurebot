caption: PZH, INT777 and BAs activate TGR5-STAT3-A20 to inhibit activation of the
  NF-κB and MAPK pathway. (A) Peritoneal macropahges were pretreated with Pien Tze
  Huang (PZH) (1.25 mg/mL), INT-777 (30 μM), and bile acids (BAs) for 2 h and then
  treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/mL) for 40 min. The effect of Pien
  Tze Huang (PZH), INT-777 and bile acids (BAs) including cholic acid (CA) (61.53 μM),
  deoxycholic acid (DCA) (27.25 μM), chenodexycholic acid (9.75 μM), taurocholic acid
  (TCA) (20.52 μM), glycocholic acid (GCA) (7.466 μM) and lithocholic acid (LCA) (0.413 μM)
  on regulating the protein expression of G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5),
  phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, A20, phospho-p65, phospho-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases, phospho-C-Jun N-terminal kinases treated with lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). The results are representative of one of three experiments.
