caption: Analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and apoptotic markers in MCF-7 cells
  treated with compounds 22 and 25 for 48 h at a concentration of 50 nM. The expression
  levels of (a) Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, including their phosphorylated forms,
  as well as (b) cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2, p53, procaspase-9, and PARP, were measured.
  Protein expression levels were analyzed using Western blot analysis, with Î²-actin
  serving as the loading control in both cases. Reproduced with permission from ref.
