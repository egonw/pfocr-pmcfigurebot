caption: Characterization of exosomes of SW480/oxaliplatin cells. Exosomes were extracted
  from SW480/oxaliplatin and SW480 cells and then co-cultured with HUVECs. (a) Transmission
  electron photomicrograph of exosomes. (b) Protein expression of CD9, CD63, and CD81.
  (c) Confocal images of PKH67-labeled exosomes taken up by HUVECs. All the above
  experiments were repeatedly performed 3 times; data are shown as the means ± SD.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
