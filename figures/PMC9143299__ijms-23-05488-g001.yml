caption: 'Zinc promotes adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocytes
  were cultured in the presence or absence of ZnCl2 (0, 5, 10, and 20 μM) to determine
  its cytotoxicity (A), and adipocyte differentiation was induced in the continued
  presence of the same concentrations of ZnCl2 in later experiments. After differentiation,
  intracellular lipid content was determined by measuring fluorescent staining (Bar:
  100 µm) (B) and triglycerides (TG) (C). Results are shown as the mean ± SD for three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05 compared to the untreated group.'
