caption: 'SIRT4 alleviated heat stress-reduced milk synthesis in BMECs. (A–D) The
  mRNA expression levels of milk proteins, as well as lipid and glucose synthesis-related
  genes (SREBP1, GLUT1, CSN2, and ELF5), in BMECs were detected by RT-qPCR after expression
  of SIRT4. (E–I) Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of SREBP1,
  GLUT1, CSN2, and ELF5 in SIRT4-expressed BMECs under heat stress conditions. NC:
  negative control; Mock: expression of control vector. These results are presented
  as the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001.'
