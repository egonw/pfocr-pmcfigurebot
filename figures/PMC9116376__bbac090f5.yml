caption: The male A549 and the female H2172 cell lines are top candidates for studies
  on Nrf2 regulation and activity. The density (A) and box (B) plots show that lung
  cancer cell lines with higher expression levels of Nrf2–ARE pathway genes exhibit
  higher resistance to the oxidative stress inducer menadione (BRD-K78126613-001-28-5,
  P = 0.00014, P.adj < 0.01, two-tailed Wilcoxon test). The density (C) and box (D)
  plots show that lung cancer cell lines with different KEAP1 mutation status and
  expression levels of Nrf2–ARE pathway genes show sensitivity differences to NFE2L2
  knockout (P = 2.6e−06, P.adj < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test). The A549 and
  the H2172 cell lines are highlighted in a triangle shape with a darker color and
  labeled in the box plots. ARE, antioxidant response element; P, P-value; P.adj,
  adjusted P-value; Chronos, an algorithm for inferring gene knockout fitness effects.
