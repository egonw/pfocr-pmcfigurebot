caption: SNHG1-induced stem-cell-like and invasive behaviors were mediated by the
  upregulation of Rac1 in both T24T and UMUC3 cells. (A, Left panel) Total protein
  extracts from cultured T24T(Vector) and T24T(SNHG1) cells were subjected to Western
  blotting using antibodies against SOX2, OCT4, CD133, and Rac1. β-Actin served as
  a loading control. (A, Right panel) Relative protein levels determined by densitometry
  and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin. The uncropped blots and molecular weight
  markers of this figure and all other figures in this paper are shown in a  named
  “uncropped gel images”. (B, Left panel) CRISPR/Cas9-Rac1 or its scramble vector
  was stably transfected into T24T(SNHG1) cells, and the transfectants were assessed
  by Western blotting for Rac1 expression. β-Actin was used as a protein loading control.
  (B, Right panel) Relative protein levels determined by densitometry and expressed
  as ratios versus β-Actin. (C,D) The indicated cells were subjected to a stem-cell-like
  sphere formation assay. Representative images were photographed (C), and the number
  of spheres was counted and presented relative to T24T(SNHG1/Vector) cells (D). (E,F)
  T24T(SNHG1) cells and T24T(SNHG1/KO-Rac1) cells were subjected to transwell migration/invasion
  assays (E), and the extent of migration and invasion was calculated and presented
  in terms of relative motility to the T24T(SNHG1) control (F). The results are presented
  as means  ±  SD from triplicate experiments, and an asterisk (*) indicates a significant
  decrease in comparison to T24T(SNHG1) cells (p  <  0.01). (G) SNHG1 over-expression
  was verified in UMUC3(SNHG1) in comparison to UMUC3(Vector) cells, with significant
  increases marked with an asterisk (*) (p < 0.01). (H,I) Invasion of UMUC3(Vector)
  and UMUC3(SNHG1) cells was determined using a BD BiocoatTM MatrigelTM invasion chamber.
  (J, Left panel) The protein extracts from the indicated cells were subjected to
  Western blotting to determine the expression of SOX2, OCT4, CD133, and Rac1. β-Actin
  was used as a protein loading control. (J, Right panel) Relative protein levels
  determined by densitometry and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin. (K, Left panel)
  CRISPR/Cas9-Rac1 and its scramble vector were stably transfected into UMUC3(SNHG1)
  cells, and the transfectants were identified by Western blotting. (K, Right panel)
  Relative protein levels determined by densitometry and expressed as ratios versus
  β-Actin. (L,M) UMUC3(SNHG1) cells and UMUC3(SNHG1/KO-RAC1) cells were subjected
  to a transwell migration/invasion assay; the invasion rate between the cells was
  calculated as above. The results are presented as mean  ±  SD from triplicate experiments,
  and asterisks (*) indicate a significant decrease in comparison to UMUC3(SNHG1)
  cells (p  <  0.01). Bars in (C) are equal to 200 μM and equal to 100 μm in (E,H,L).
