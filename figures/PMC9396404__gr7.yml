caption: XBP1u stimulates gluconeogenesis in cultured primary hepatocytes and liver.A–D,
  liver tissues of C57BL6 mice were collected at fed and fasted (24 h) states. Immunoblots
  (A), densitometric analysis of the phosphorylation levels of IRE1 (B), and protein
  levels of XBP1s (C) and XBP1u (D) (n = 5). E, XBP1u augmented PKA-stimulated reporter
  activity in Hepa1-6 cells cotransfected with 100 ng of XBP1u and XBP1s plasmids
  and 30 ng of CRE-Luciferase reporter plasmid (n = 3). F, Hepa1-6 cells were cotransfected
  with 150 ng of pFR-Luciferase reporter plasmid, 20 ng of pFA-CREB, 100 ng of XBP1u,
  XBP1s, and PKA plasmids (n = 3). G–I, twenty-four hours after the seeding of primary
  hepatocytes, adenoviral expression vectors of GFP and XBP1u were added. Forty-eight hours
  later, primary hepatocytes were subjected to 3 h serum starvation, followed by washing
  with PBS, and addition of glucose production medium and/or 0.2 mM cAMP for 3 h (G)
  (n = 3). One set of hepatocytes were harvested in TRIzol reagent for the determination
  of mRNA levels of G6pc (H) and Pck1(I) (n = 3). J, primary hepatocytes were treated
  with adenoviral shRNA of XBP1 together with adenoviral expression vectors of GFP
  or XBP1u. Cells were treated as in (G) (n = 3). K–P, three-month-old WT mice were
  injected (jugular vein) with AAV8-XBP1shRNA (shXBP1-3) (4 × 10ˆ11GC/mouse) and AAV8-TBG-GFP
  or AAV8-TBG-XBP1u (1.5 × 1012 GC/mouse) (n = 5). Immunoblots from collected liver
  tissues (K), and densitometric analysis of the protein levels of G6PC (L) and PEPCK
  (M). Ten days after the viral injection (v.i.), blood glucose levels were determined
  (4 h fast) (O) (n = 5). Fourteen days after the v.i., pyruvate challenge experiment
  was conducted (16 h fast, 1.5 g/kg) (P) (n = 5). Twenty-one days after the viral
  injection, liver samples were collected. Of note, two liver samples from 24-h fasted
  mice were loaded to serve as loading control in (K). Q, proposed model for insulin
  regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism through regulating IRE1-XBP1 signaling.
  n.f., nonspecific (G and J). ∗p < 0.05, Student’s t test. AAV, adeno-associated
  viruses; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme; XBP1,
  X-box binding protein 1; XBP1u, XBP1 from an unspliced form; XBP1s, XBP1 from a
  spliced form.
