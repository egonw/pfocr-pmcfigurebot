caption: Multiple alignments with the amino acid sequences of Panicum virgatum DFR
  (PvDFRa) and close structural homologs. Included in the alignment are Sorghum bicolor
  DFR (SbDFR3), Sorghum bicolor FNRs (SbFNR1 and SbFNR2), Vitis vinifera DFR (VvDFR),
  Medicago sativa vestitone reductase (MsVR), Vitis vinifera anthocyanidin reductase
  (VvANR), Petunia x hybrida cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (PhCCR) and Medicago truncatula
  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (MtCAD2). Residues highlighted in blue are in β-strands,
  while those in red are in α-helices. A short 310 helix is labeled 3a. Catalytic
  triad residues are indicated with an asterisk (*) and the residue facing the B-ring
  is indicated with a dagger (†).
