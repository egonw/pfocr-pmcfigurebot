figure_title: Potassium channels affect pluripotency in hESCs
caption: 'a Images showing untreated hESCs grown in mTeSR1 media or cells treated
  with 1 mM Barium or 25 nM Ergtoxin and immunostained for pluripotency factors. Scale
  bar = 100 μm. b Quantification of the results in a; AU arbitrary units. p-values
  are Oct4: (control vs Ba) = 0.03, (control vs Erg) = 4.5e-04; Sox2 (control vs Ba) = 0.06,
  (control vs Erg) = 4.4e-04. c Images showing untreated hESCs grown in MEF-CM media
  or cells treated with 100 nM rapamycin with or without 25 nM Ergtoxin. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  d Quantification of the results in c; AU arbitrary units. p-values are Nanog: (control
  vs Rapa) = 4.5e-04, (control vs Rapa+Erg) = 4.3e-04; Oct4: (control vs Rapa) = 0.002,
  (control vs Rapa+Erg) = 0.002; Sox2 (control vs Rapa) = 7.7e-04, (control vs Rapa+Erg) = 7.6e-04.
  Graphs (b) and (d) present mean ± SEM; key for asterisks: *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01;
  ***p ≤ 0.001; ns nonsignificant for p < 0.05; data were derived from 400 cells/3
  independent replicates over at least 2 independent experiments. Source data are
  provided as a Source Data file. e Model for the onset of embryonic differentiation
  depicting classical biochemical signaling (right) that is complemented by regulation
  via membrane potential (left). In the electrophysiological pathway, potassium channels
  set the membrane potential, which limits activation of voltage-gated calcium channels
  and suppresses intracellular Ca2+ levels. Both pathways result in changes in gene
  expression, mediated by intracellular signal transducers (right), or by factors
  that require calcium (left). While biochemical pathways are essential to induce
  expression of differentiation factors, the electrophysiological pathway affects
  cell fate indirectly by controlling the timing of downregulation of pluripotency
  genes. Adapted from “Transporters”, by BioRender.com (2022). Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates.'
