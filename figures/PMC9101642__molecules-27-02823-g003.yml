caption: The overall procedure workflow used for the definition of the 3-D pharmacophore/3-D
  QSAR models and their analysis is depicted as a “black” pathway. The application
  of generated 3-D pharmacophore/3-D QSAR models in structure-based and ligand-based
  virtual screening is depicted as a “red” pathway.
