caption: miR-424 inhibitor greatly suppressed PTEN/PI3K/AKT, but miR-424 mimic markedly
  activated this signaling pathway. (A) The protein expression of PTEN/PI3K/AKT was
  detected with western blotting; (B) The protein expression was analyzed; (C) The
  mRNA levels of PTEN/PI3K/AKT were measured with RT-PCR; (D) The binding site between
  miR-424 and PTEN was predicted with TargetScan data base; (E) The luciferase activity
  of PTEN-WT was inhibited by miR-424. * means p <0.05. The experiment was performed
  3 times.
