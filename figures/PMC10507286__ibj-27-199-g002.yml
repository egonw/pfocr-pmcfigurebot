caption: 'The cell shape of the control cells treated with PDGF-BB and isorhamnetin
  (A-C). The cells treated with PDGF-BB were activated, while isorhamnetin could inactive
  the cells. Effects of different concentrations of isorhamnetin on the COLA1 (D)
  and α-SMA (E) gene expression in isorhamnetin-treated cells. The level of mRNA expression
  of COLA1 and α-SMA genes reduced with 75 and 100 μM of isorhamnetin but did not
  reduce with 50 and 25 μM of this compound. Data are presented with the mean ± SEM
  and three replicates. GAPDH was the reference gene. (***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001
  vs. treated control; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. treated with isorhamnetin).'
