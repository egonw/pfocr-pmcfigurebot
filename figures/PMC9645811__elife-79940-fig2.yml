figure_title: Bone marrow (BM) microenvironment substantially limits downregulation
  of mTOR and MYC pathway in FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells upon FLT3
  inhibition in vitro and in vivo
caption: '(A–C) RNA from MOLM-13 cells was harvested after 15 hr of treatment with
  vehicle or 3 nM quizartinib in either RPMI or human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC-CM)
  and subjected to RNA-seq (n = 3). (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot of
  each group. (B) Top 10 enriched signaling pathways (by p-adj) from gene set enrichment
  analyses (GSEA) of Hallmark gene sets applied on RNA-seq data from quizartinib-treated
  cells in hBMSC-CM compared with quizartinib-treated cells in RPMI. Pathways with
  significant alteration (p-adj<0.1) and negative normalized enrichment score (NES)
  are represented with red. (C) Enrichment plots and heatmaps showing comparisons
  of transcriptomes of mTORC1 signaling or MYC targets between quizartinib (Quiz)-treated
  cells in hBMSC-CM and quizartinib-treated cells in RPMI. (D) MOLM-13 cells were
  treated as indicated and harvested at different time points (3, 6, 10, and 15 hr)
  to measure mTORC1 signaling and c-MYC protein levels by Western blotting. (E) Design
  of in vivo study using human AML xenograft mouse model. NRG-S mice were transplanted
  with primary FLT3-ITD+ AML cells (AML #1: from a 69-year-old female patient with
  newly diagnosed AML with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations). One cohort of mice was treated
  with vehicle, while the other cohort was treated with 2.5 mg/kg quizartinib for
  16 hr (n = 3). After spleen and BM were harvested, human AML cells were isolated
  by CD45 isolation kit and RNA from each sample were collected for RNA-seq. (F) PCA
  plot of RNA-seq data from human AML samples isolated from spleen and BM. Samples
  from the same mouse are denoted by the same number. (G) Top 10 enriched signaling
  pathways (by p-adj) from GSEA of Hallmark gene sets applied on RNA-seq data from
  human AML cells. Samples from the BM of quizartinib-treated mice were compared with
  the samples from the spleen of the same paired mouse, and top 10 pathways are shown
  on the left. Pathways with significant alteration (p-adj<0.1) are represented with
  colors (red: negative NES; blue: positive NES). Asterisks denote pathways that exhibited
  similarly significant enrichment patterns from in vitro study (B). Enrichment plots
  of mTORC1 signaling or MYC target genes are shown on the right. Figure 2—source
  data 1.Unedited raw blots for  are shown.  Figure 2—source data 2.Unedited blots
  with labels for  are shown.  Figure 2—source data 3.Oxidative phosphorylation and
  G2/M checkpoint exhibited a higher enrichment in the bone marrow (BM) compared to
  spleen for both vehicle- and quizatinib-treated mice.Top 10 enrichment pathways
  (by p-adj) from gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of Hallmark gene sets applied
  on RNA-seq data from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Samples from the
  spleen of vehicle-treated mice were compared with the samples from the BM of the
  same paired mouse. Pathways with significant alteration (p-adj<0.1) are represented
  with colors (red: negative normalized enrichment score [NES]; blue: positive NES).
  Asterisks represent matched pathways with same enrichment patterns observed from
  GSEA of Hallmark gene sets comparing the spleen from quizartinib-treated mice with
  BM of the same paired mouse ().'
