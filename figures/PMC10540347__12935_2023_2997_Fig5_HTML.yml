caption: SQLE Knockdown inhibited T24 and 5637 cell cycle and promoted cell apoptosis.
  (A) Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of G1, S, and G2/M phase cell
  population in T24 and 5637; (B) Flow cytometry was used to detect the early apoptosis
  and late apoptosis cell population in T24 and 5637; (C, D) The western blot assay
  was used to evaluate the expression of cell cycle and cell apoptosis related genes;
  (E–G) Representative images of JC-1 immunofluorescence and the ratio of red to green
  fluorescence showed a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Data are
  presented herein as the from three independent experiments. Data represent the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the
  vector group, ns, not significant)
