caption: 'Periplocymarin (PM) suppressed AngⅡ‐induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and
  STAT3. (A) H9c2 cells were incubated with 1 μM AngⅡ for 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h respectively.
  The phosphorylation of JAK2 (Tyr1007 + 1008) and STAT3 (Tyr705) was detected by
  Western blot. (B) H9c2 cells were pretreated with PM (12.5, 25, 50 μM) and 50 μM
  Val for 3 h followed by 1 μM AngⅡ for 12 h. The expressions of p‐JAK2 (Tyr1007 + 1008)
  and p‐STAT3 (Tyr705) were measured by Western blot. (C) H9c2 cells were treated
  with 1 μM AngⅡ in the presence of 50 μM PM, 25 μM S3I and 50 μM PM + 25 μM S3I.
  The protein levels of p‐STAT3 (Tyr705) and hypertrophic markers were measured. (D)
  Assessment of cell area changes through phalloidin staining. Bars: 50 μm. #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. control group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. AngⅡ group.
  Data were presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3'
