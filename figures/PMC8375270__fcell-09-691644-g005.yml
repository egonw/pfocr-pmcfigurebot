caption: Developmental pathways co-opted during viral oncogenesis. Viruses deregulate
  developmental signaling to support malignant transformation and disease progression,
  via a variety of mechanisms, including (but not limited) to, increased proliferation
  and cell survival, induced stemness to improve fitness of the cancer cells, accrued
  neo-vascularization, activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  evasion of tumor-targeting immune response. Inhibitors of developmental pathways
  may prevent the acquisition of new properties by the cancer cells, such as virus-induced
  transcriptional, metabolic, and functional reprogramming. Each color is associated
  with a specific virus and the cell processes controlled the developmental pathway.
