caption: The effect of silencing SECTM1 expression on the proliferation, migration
  and invasion of GBM cells was detected. Fluorescence image of the effect of EdU
  detection on proliferation of U87 MG (A-B) and U251 MG (C-D) cells after SECTM1
  knockdown expression, scale, 10 μm. Representative images (E) and statistical (F-G)
  analysis of cell migration ability after SECTM1 knockdown in U87 MG and U251 MG,
  scale, 10μm. Representative image (H) and relative migration area (I) of cell wound
  healing assay after SECTM1 knockdown in U251 MG. Representative image of cell invasion
  assay after SECTM1 knockdown in U87 MG and U251 MG (J) and statistical number of
  cells invaded (K-L). The data were expressed as the mean value of the three experiments
  ±SEM, ** P <0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001.
