caption: Overview of the pathway analysis arranged according to the scores from the
  enrichment analysis (y-axis) and the topology analysis (x-axis). The color and size
  of each circle (pathways) are based on its p-value and pathway impact value, respectively.
  Circles located in the top right diagonal region represent pathways with significant
  metabolite changes and higher impact. The pathway names with the highest impact
  values (largest circles) are mentioned (glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism;
  glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; citrate cycle; glutathione metabolism;
  pyruvate metabolism).
