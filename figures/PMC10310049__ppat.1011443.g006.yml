figure_title: TRIM21 restricts viral infection by inhibiting the activation of PKR
  signaling pathway
caption: (A-B) IFNAR1-deficient A549 cells (A) or IFNAR1-deficient HLCZ01 (B) cells
  were infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21)
  for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2 or 0.5) for 6 h. The indicated proteins
  were detected by western blot. GAPDH (A) or β-actin (B) was used as an internal
  control. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of the VSV RNA or the mRNA levels of TRIM21 in IFNAR1-deficient
  A549 cells (sg-IFNAR1) infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21
  (sh-TRIM21) for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2 or 0.5) for 6 h. (D) Plaque
  assay analysis of the VSV titers in IFNAR1-deficient HLCZ01 cells infected with
  lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21) for 48 h, then
  infected with VSV (MOI = 0.5) for 6 h. (E) IFNAR1/STAT2 double-deficient A549 cells
  were infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21)
  for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2 or 0.5) for 6 h. RT-qPCR analysis of
  the VSV RNA or the mRNA level of TRIM21. (F) HLCZ01-sh-IRF3 cells were infected
  with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21) for 48
  h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2 or 0.5) for 6 h. The indicated proteins were
  detected by western blot. (G) RT-qPCR analysis of the VSV RNA or the mRNA level
  of TRIM21 in IRF3-silenced HLCZ01 cells (HLCZ01-sh-IRF3) infected with lentivirus-sh-vector
  (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21) for 48 h, then infected with VSV
  (MOI = 0.5) for 6 h. (H) Huh7.5 cells infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector)
  or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21) for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2
  or 0.5) for 6 h. RT-qPCR analysis of the level of VSV RNA or TRIM21 mRNA. (I) Huh7.5
  cells infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21)
  for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.5) for 6 h. The indicated proteins were
  detected by western blot. (J) IFNAR1/PKR double-deficient A549 cells were infected
  with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21) for 48
  h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2) for 6 h. The levels of VSV RNA were examined
  by RT-qPCR. (K) Wild-type (sg-vector) or PKR-deficient (sg-PKR) Huh7.5 cells were
  infected with lentivirus-sh-vector (sh-vector) or lentivirus-sh-TRIM21 (sh-TRIM21)
  for 48 h, then infected with VSV (MOI = 0.2) for 6 h. The levels of VSV RNA were
  examined by RT-qPCR. Experiments were independently repeated two or three time with
  similar results. The relative ratios of p-PKR or p-eIF2α in (A, B, F and I) were
  quantified by densiometric analysis, which were normalized to the value in the control
  group with two or three independent repeats. The mRNA data in (C-E, G-H, J-K) from
  two or three independent experiments. The data shown are mean ± SD. P values were
  determined by Student’s t-test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. NS, no significance
  difference. ND, not detected.
