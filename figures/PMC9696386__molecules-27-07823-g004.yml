caption: (A) The signaling pathway proposed for mediation of antidiabetic activity
  of α-PGG, in which α-PGG activates the insulin receptor (IR) in terms of its glucose
  transport stimulatory activity. It induces phosphorylation of the IR and Akt and
  activates PI3K followed by stimulating membrane translocation of GLUT 4 to keep
  glucose transport into cells. (B) Aronia berries and their potential beneficial
  activities in the promotion of human health.
