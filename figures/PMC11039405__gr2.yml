caption: FleR inactivates the transcriptional activity of the exsCEBA promoter independently
  of FleS(A) β-galactosidase activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ and PexsA-lacZ transcriptional
  fusions was measured in the PAO1 WT and ΔfleR strains.(B) β-galactosidase activity
  of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in PAO1 WT, ΔfleR, ΔexsA,
  ΔexsAΔfleR, and ΔexsAΔfleR(exsA) strains. EV represents empty vector.(C) β-galactosidase
  activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in the ΔfleR mutant
  with in trans overexpression of FleR and its D53A variant.(D) β-galactosidase activity
  of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in the ΔfleS mutant with
  in trans overexpression of FleR. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s
  t test. ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; n.s., no significance compared to the indicated group.
