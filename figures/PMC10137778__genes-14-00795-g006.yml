caption: Gene Ontology analysis bar plots for the most significantly enriched pathways
  under chronic stress. (A) Ammonia treatment showing the 10 most significantly enriched
  pathways in the Cellular component, Biological Process and molecular Function categories.
  The green bars represent the down-regulated genes while the red bars represent the
  up-regulated genes. (B) Stocking density treatment showing the 10 most significantly
  enriched pathways in the Cellular component, Biological Process and molecular Function
  categories. The green bars represent the down-regulated genes while the red bars
  represent the up-regulated genes. The proportion of the red (up-regulated) to the
  Green (down-regulated) depicts the level of pathway enrichment.
