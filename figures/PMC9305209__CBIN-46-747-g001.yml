caption: 'Effects of secretory PKG II on PDGF‐BB‐induced activation of PDGFRβ and
  downstream PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathway. The AGS and HGC‐27 cells were pretreated
  with GST‐PKG II (100 ng/ml) and cGMP (250 μΜ) for 1 h, and then treated with PDGF‐BB
  (100 ng/ml) for 10 min followed by detection performed by Western blotting with
  antibodies against p‐ PDGFRβ, PDGFRβ, p‐PI3K, PI3K, p‐Akt, Akt, p‐MEK, MEK, p‐ERK,
  ERK. (*p < 0.05, compared to control group; #p < 0.05, compared to PDGF‐BB group).
  Abbreviations: cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; PDGF, platelet‐derived growth
  factor; PDGFR, platelet‐derived growth factor receptor; PKG II, type II cGMP‐dependent
  protein kinase'
