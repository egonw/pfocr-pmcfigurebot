caption: Metabolomic analysis of GRb1 treatment in diabetes zebrafish model. (A,B)
  Overall metabolic profiles of samples between control, model and test groups using
  PCA and PLS-DA plots. n = 8 per group. (C–E) Volcano plots of differential metabolites
  between G1 and G2, G2 and G3, and G2 and G4. G1, larvae exposed in E3 water; G2,
  larvae treated with 4% glucose; G3, larvae treated with 4% glucose + 100 μg/mL GRb1;
  G4, larvae treated with 4% glucose + 200 μg/mL GRb1. (F) Venn diagram of differential
  metabolite amounts. MC represents G2 vs. G1; LM represents G3 vs. G2; HM represents
  G4 vs. G2. (G) KEGG pathway maps for the differential metabolites.
