caption: 'NRF2-KEAP1 signaling contributes to increased resistance to oxidative stress
  during differentiation of lt-NES cells. (A–D) Contribution of the NRF2 pathway to
  the OS response in differentiating lt-NES cultures was assessed using the NRF2 inhibitor
  ML385. Cell viability in response to oxidative stress was assessed in undifferentiated
  lt-NES cells (A) and lt-NES cells differentiated for 4 (B), 8 (C) and 12 (D) weeks
  after 24 h pre-treatment with ML385 followed by 24 h tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)
  treatment. Toxicity was assessed by ATPlite assay at the end of the treatment period
  with the indicated concentrations. Data are presented as means ± SEM (n ≥ 3, consisting
  of at least 4 technical replicates each). Significant difference between TBHP treatments
  with or without ML385 was confirmed by two-way ANOVA (Interaction p values: 0 w
  p < 0.0001; 4 w p = 0.9990; 8 w p < 0.0001; 12 w p < 0.0001) followed by Sidak’s
  multiple comparisons test (* = p < 0.05).'
