figure_title: Mito-respiratory gene silencing alters metabolic network structures
  and in vivo tumor growth
caption: (A-D) Pathway analysis of HCC827 cells expressing individual CRISPRi sgRNA
  (control or mito-respiratory hits c14orf2, MALSU1, or TMEM261) grown in vitro (A-C)
  or HCC827 cells expressing an individual CRISPRi sgRNA against MALSU1 grown in vivo
  as flank tumor (D) was performed by integrating transcriptome and metabolomics data
  and plotted on a KEGG graph depicting pathway components for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
  (E) H1975 cells transduced with either control sgRNA or individual sgRNAs against
  c14orf2, MALSU1, or TMEM261 were analyzed using Seahorse. OCR shown, compilation
  of 3 independent experiments, each analyzing n = 4 per cell line, normalized to
  cell numbers. Mean shown, 2-way ANOVA, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (F) OCR and ECAR
  measurements for cells grown under basal or forced glycolysis (oligomycin). Compilation
  of 3 independent experiments, each analyzing n = 4 replicates per cell line and
  normalized to cell numbers. (G) ATP levels were measured in different substrate
  conditions (basal, respiratory (10 mM 2DG), glycolytic (5 μM oligomycin) or depletion
  (no glucose or pyruvate)) mean and SEM shown, 2-way ANOVA, ***p < 0.001). (H, I)
  NAD+/NADH ratios and NAD+/NADH pool size. Shown are compilation of 2 independent
  experiments **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (J) MitoSox assay measuring mitochondrial
  superoxide. Compilation of 3 independent experiments, each analyzing n = 4 replicates
  per cell line. Two-way ANOVA, **p < 0.01. (K) Cells expressing either control sgRNA
  or MALSU1 sgRNA were injected orthotopically into the left lungs of mice, then mice
  were imaged using BLI 21 days postinjection. (L) Day 21 radiance within the left
  1/3, central 1/3, and right 1/3 chest regions in mice injected with control sgRNA
  tumor cells. N = 4 mice, mean shown. (M) Day 21 radiance within left 1/3, central
  1/3, and right 1/3, chest regions in mice injected with MALSU1 sgRNA tumor cells.
  N = 6 mice, mean shown. (N) Central 1/3 and contralateral right 1/3 lung radiance
  each normalized to the matched left 1/3 radiance for control and MALSU1 mice, mean
  shown, t test *p < 0.05. (O) Day 21postinjection radiance within the left 1/3 chest
  in mice injected with either control or TMEM261-silenced tumor cells (n = 4 mice
  for control, n = 5 mice for TMEM261, mean shown Mann–Whitney test, *p < 0.05). (P)
  Day 28 postinjection central 1/3 and contralateral right 1/3 lung radiance, each
  reading normalized to the matched left 1/3 radiance for control and TMEM261 cells
  (n = 4 mice and n = 5 mice, respectively) mean shown, Mann–Whitney test, ns. (Q)
  HE-stained sections of right lungs from mice injected with either control sgRNA
  tumor cells or TMEM261 sgRNA tumor cells showing micrometastatic tumor deposits.
  Red arrows indicate intraparenchymal micrometastases; black arrows indicate perivascular
  metastases. (R) Systems-level testing implicates context-specific growth effects
  of mitochondrial/respiratory function and ATP levels. ATP-modulating CRISPRi hits
  grown in lung cancer cells produce specific energy substrate-driven growth effects
  in vitro and in vivo. In vitro growth correlates with glycolytic ATP, while in vivo
  primary growth in the subcutaneous and orthotopic lung setting correlate with mitochondrial-derived
  ATP. Silencing discrete mito-respiratory genes also impacts the growth of regional
  metastases, which are distinguishable from the primary tumor. Underlying data can
  be found in  and  and  Data. BLI, bioluminescence imaging; ECAR, extracellular acidification
  rate; HE, hematoxylin–eosin; OCR, oxygen consumption rate.
