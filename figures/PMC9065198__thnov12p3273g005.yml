caption: 'Chiasmatic electrode has broad potential applications in monitoring and
  treating optic neuropathy. (A) Representative waveforms of f-OCP before and 1 month
  after retrobulbar ON crush under different light intensities. (B) Quantification
  of f-OCP P1-N1 amplitude before and after crush, n = 3 goats, two-way ANOVA, p =
  0.0324. (C) Demonstration of the custom-made region-biased retinal sensitivity detector,
  which allowed light emission from a quadrant. (D) Representative waveforms of f-OCP
  and f-VEP in response to light stimulation from a quadrant. (E, F) Quantification
  of (D). n = 3 goats, two-way ANOVA with Dunnett''s multiple comparisons (compared
  with 0 cd·s/m2). (G) Schematic of two electrical fields established with either
  the chiasmatic skull base electrode (eye-to-chiasm field) or a conventional occipital
  electrode (eye-to-occipital field). (H) Representative waveforms of electrically
  evoked potentials between the eye and optic chiasm under two different electrical
  fields in (G). (I) Quantification of (H). n = 3 goats, two-way ANOVA with Tukey''s
  multiple comparisons. (J, K, L) Fourier transform, wavelet and MTF analyses of f-OCP
  under different light intensities. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m, ns: not significant,
  *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ****: p < 0.0001.'
