caption: Macrophages with dysregulated CMPK2 display increased hypoxia. (A) Scatter
  plot of genes differentially expressed in KD or OE macrophages relative to the expression
  levels in the control macrophages (NT or VC), respectively. Change in expression
  is depicted as log2 fold change in expression. The number of genes upregulated and
  downregulated in the macrophages is depicted as a Venn diagram (inset). (B) GSEA
  hallmark pathway enrichment analysis of the commonly upregulated and downregulated
  genes in the KD and OE macrophages are represented as a bubble plot. X axis is the
  number of genes of the pathway and size of the bubble depicts significance (−log
  p-value). (C) Heat map of the hypoxia response gene expression in the CMPK2 dysregulated
  macrophages KD and OE. The values represent log2 fold change from the corresponding
  control cells. (D) Analysis of HIF1α in protein extracts of NT, KD, VC, and OE cells.
  Equal amounts of protein from the different extracts were probed with specific antibodies,
  and a representative blot of three independent experiments is depicted. The change
  in expression level of HIF1α with respect to α-TUBULIN was calculated by densitometric
  analysis and is graphically represented. GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. **p<0.01.
