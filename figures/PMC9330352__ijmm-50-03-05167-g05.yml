caption: 'TFRD promotes CD31hiEmcnhi vessel formation in angiogenic-osteogenic coupling
  during distraction osteogenesis via the PDGF-BB/PDGFR-β pathway. (A) Representative
  immunofluorescence images and (B) quantification of RUNX2, OSX, CD31 and PDGF-BB
  in the distracted tibias after distraction for 4 weeks. (C) Representative western
  blotting images and (D) semi-quantitative analyses of PDGF-BB, VEGF, RUNX2, OSX
  as well as the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in the distracted tibias at 4 weeks
  post-distraction. (E) Quantification of mRNA expression levels of PDGF-BB, VEGF,
  RUNX2 and OSX. Data represent the mean ± SD. n=3 rats in each group from three independent
  experiments. *P<0.05 vs. control group; #P<0.05 vs. PDGF-BB-Ab group. TFRD, total
  flavonoids of Rhizoma drynariae; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Emcn, endomucin;
  PDGFR-β, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β; RUNX2, runt-related transcription
  factor 2; OSX, Osterix; p-, phosphorylated.'
