caption: Hyperactivation of MYC transcription factors (TFs) in a jasmonate zim‐domain
  decuple mutant (jazD) of Arabidopsis restricts shoot and root growth. (a) Schematic
  of the jasmonate (JA) signalling pathway and its various growth and defence‐related
  outputs. JAZ‐repressible TFs (e.g. MYCs) modulate JA responses involved in growth
  and defence. Genetic perturbations (blunt‐ended red arrows) used in this study to
  manipulate JA responses include loss‐of‐function mutations in 10 genes encoding
  JASMONATE ZIM‐DOMAIN (JAZ) repressors (jazD) or three genes encoding MYC TFs (mycT
  or myc234). Wound‐induced accumulation of endogenous JA‐Ile results in COI1‐dependent
  JAZ ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome (26S). Two
  general hypotheses (H 1 and H 2) to explain how de‐repression of TF activity inhibits
  (blunt‐ended black arrows) growth in the JAZ‐depleted jazD mutant. H 1, TFs control
  the expression of genes that directly affect growth responses. H 2, changes in metabolism
  resulting from TF‐dependent defence responses indirectly affect growth. (b) Rosette
  fresh weight of 26‐d‐old wild‐type (WT), mycT, jazD and jazD mycT plants. Values
  show the mean ± SD (n = 5 biological replicates). Letters denote significant differences
  according to Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test (P < 0.05). (c)
  Root length of 10‐d‐old WT, mycT, jazD and jazD mycT seedlings grown on plates.
  Values show the mean ± SD (n = 24–30 biological replicates). Letters denote significant
  differences according to Tukey's HSD test (P < 0.05). (d) Photograph of representative
  WT, mycT, jazD and jazD mycT plants grown for 73 d under short‐day conditions (8 h : 16 h,
  day : night). Bar, 2 cm.
