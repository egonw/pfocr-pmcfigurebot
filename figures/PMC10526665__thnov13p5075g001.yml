caption: Identification of A4276, a selective cytotoxic agent for NAPRT-deficient
  lung cancer cell lines. (A) Schematic of NAD+ metabolism. Enzymes and metabolites
  related to NAD+ de novo biosynthesis pathway are not listed for simplicity. (B)
  Steady-state accumulation of NAPRT was assessed via immunoblot of whole-cell lysates
  from the indicated human lung cancer cell lines. Beta-actin was used as a loading
  control. (C) (Upper panel) The dose-response curves for eight different lung cancer
  cell lines after 72 hours of exposure to A4276 and chemical structure of A4276.
  The cell lines are categorized into two distinct groups based on their NAPRT status,
  NAPRT-positive (light blue) and NAPRT-negative (light red). (Lower panel) Violin
  plots of A4276 sensitivity for the two groups of lung cancer cell lines based on
  relative AUC and log10 ED50 values. (D) Violin plots representing the sensitivity
  of the lung cancer cell lines to FK866 (Left) and KPT-9274 (Right) based on relative
  AUC and log10 ED50 values. Dose-response curves are provided in B-C. (C, D) *p <
  0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, not significant (ns). Student's t-test was used
  for the comparison of drug sensitivity between the cell line groups.
