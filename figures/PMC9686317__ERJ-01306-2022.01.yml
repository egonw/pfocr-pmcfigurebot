caption: 'Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to upregulation of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase
  (CH25H) and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily member B1 (CYP7B1) expression in
  the lung and production of the oxysterols 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol
  (7α,25-OHC). a) The biosynthetic pathway of 25-OHC and 7α,25-OHC. b) Experimental
  design: C57BL/6J mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5500 plaque-forming
  units (PFU) of IAV. c) mRNA expression of Ch25h, Cyp7b1 and Hsd3b7 was measured
  by quantitative reverse transcription PCR at 3 days post infection (dpi) (D3) and
  7 dpi (D7) normalised to Hprt. d) Quantitative analysis of CH25H, CYP7B1 and HSD3B7
  protein labelling by immunohistochemistry (IHC). e) Representative IHC images of
  CH25H, CYP7B1 and HSD3B7 in lung sections of uninfected or IAV-infected mice. Scale
  bars: 100 µm (main) and 50 µm (inset). f) Concentrations of 25-OHC and 7α,25-OHC
  in the lungs (left) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (right) at 3 dpi and
  7 dpi. Data are presented as mean±sd of n=4 uninfected and n=6–10 infected mice
  per time point. ns: nonsignificant; U/I: mock infected. *: p<0.05; **: p<0.01.'
