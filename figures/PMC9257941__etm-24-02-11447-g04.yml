caption: 3-BrPA regulates expression of mitochondria-regulated apoptosis pathway proteins.
  (A) Expression levels of mitochondria-regulated apoptosis pathway proteins, including
  Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and Caspase-3 were detected through western blot analysis. (B)
  Bcl-2 protein expression was decreased, while Bax, Cyt-C and Caspase-3 protein expression
  was increased following 3-BrPA treatment in TNBC cells (*P<0.05 vs. control group,
  the same cell line with 0 ÂµM 3-BrPA). (C) However, in non-TNBC cells, the expression
  levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and Caspase-3 were not significantly affected. 3-BrPA,
  3-bromopyruvic acid; Cyt-C, cytochrome c; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer.

  axis and induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cells.
