caption: Inhibition of proteasomal degradation but not lysosomal degradation accumulates
  ubiquitinated MNK1. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with MG-132 prior to treating
  cells with VNLG-152R for short duration (2h). The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated
  MNK1 using anti-MNK1 and probed with anti-ubiquitin. The cells treated with VNLG-152R
  resulted in accumulation of higher amount of ubiquitinated MNK1 compared to the
  controls. Short duration of treatment with VNLG-152R minimizes MNK1 degradation
  and facilitates maximum recovery of ubiquitinated MNK1. (B) Treatment of TNBC cells
  with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 in presence of VNLG-152R did not significantly
  alter the MNK1/2 levels, suggesting the proteasomal pathway of degradation of MNK1/2.
  Decrease in MNK1/2 is reflected by decreased levels of phosphorylated eIF4E. (C)
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with VNLG-152R in presence or absence of lysosome
  inhibitor Bafilomycin-A1 (BafA1) or proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Inhibition of lysosome
  by BafA1 did not abrogate VNLG-152R-mediated degradation of MNK1/2 but inhibition
  of proteasome by MG-132 abolished MNK1/2 degradation. This further suggests that
  the VNLG-152R-mediated degradation of MNK1/2 is through proteasomal pathway and
  not by lysosomal degradation. β-actin served as protein loading control.
