caption: Tumorigenesis experiments in nude mice in vivo proved the effects of LINC00094
  and miR-19a-3p on breast cancer. (A) 5×106 BT-474 cells with stable expression of
  miR-19a-3p were injected into the breast fat pad of 4-week-old female BALB/c nude
  mice, and tumors were collected on the 15th day of tumor formation. (B) The tumor
  size of nude mice was measured every 3 days. (C) 5×106 BT-474 cells statically expressed
  by LINC00094 were injected into the breast fat pad of 4-week-old female BALB/c nude
  mice, and tumors were collected on the 15th day of tumor formation. (D) Tumor size
  of nude mice was measured every 3 days. 3-5 nude mice of LINC00094 stable expression
  group and control group were respectively. There was statistical difference between
  experimental group and control group. ***P<0.001. (E) On the 15th day, the tumor
  of nude mice in each group was taken and weighed. There were statistical differences
  between the experimental group and the control group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. (F) Tumor
  tissues of nude mice were stained with HE. (G) Western Blot was used to detect CYP19A1
  protein expression level of the first pair to the third pair, with GAPDH as internal
  reference, and the experiment was repeated for 3 times. N is the control group.
  T is the experimental group. ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. (H) Western Blot was used
  to detect CYP19A1 protein expression level of the 4th to 6th pairs, with GAPDH as
  internal reference, and the experiment was repeated for 3 times. N is the control
  group. T is the experimental group. ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001.
