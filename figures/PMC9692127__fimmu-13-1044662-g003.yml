caption: MPLA-induced transcription is blunted in TRIF-KO and MyD88-KO macrophages.
  (A) Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured from WT, MyD88-KO (MKO)
  and TRIF-KO (TKO) mice. BMDMs were treated with MPLA (1 μg/mL) or left unstimulated
  (US) as controls. After 24h incubation, media was changed and cells were rested
  for 3 days before harvesting RNA for RNAseq analysis. (B) Differential gene expression
  analysis of unstimulated control or MPLA-treated WT, MKO, and TKO BMDMs as shown
  by heatmap of all samples represented by columns (n=3/group) and rows corresponding
  to different genes. (C) Principal component analysis of MPLA-treated (_M) or unstimulated
  (_US) WT, MKO, and TKO BMDMs was conducted. (D) The number of MPLA-induced differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) compared to genotype unstimulated controls (above dotted
  line) or compared to MPLA-treated WT cells (below dotted line) were quantified.
  (E, F) Down-regulated (green) and up-regulated (red) DEGs were visualized by volcano
  plots for MPLA-treated MKO cells (E) or MPLA-treated TKO cells (F) compared to MPLA-treated
  WT cells. (G-J) Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis was conducted
  for the 10 most downregulated pathways in the cellular component and molecular function
  classes in MPLA-treated MKO compared to MPLA-treated WT macrophages (G, H), or compared
  to MPLA-treated TKO macrophages (I, J). The number of genes differentially regulated
  in each respective pathway (i.e. “count”) are indicated by dot size and degree of
  significance (padj) by intensity of color. n=3 biological replicates/group. Log2foldchange
  >1 and adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed.
