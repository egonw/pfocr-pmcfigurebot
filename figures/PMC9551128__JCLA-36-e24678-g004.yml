caption: 'ICAT enhanced CRC cell migration and invasion via the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
  (A) Western blotting was used to analyze P65 and p‐P65 levels in SW480 and HCT116
  ICAT‐overexpression and control cell lines, and GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (B) Western blotting was used to analyze p‐P65 and P65 levels in ICAT‐overexpressing
  SW480 and HCT116 cell lines transfected with siRNA against P65 or negative control
  siRNA for 24 h, and GAPDH was used as a loading control. (C) Transwell assay (left;
  scale bars: 100 μm) shows the migration and invasion of the indicated cells. The
  number of migrated cells (right) groups were counted. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001.'
