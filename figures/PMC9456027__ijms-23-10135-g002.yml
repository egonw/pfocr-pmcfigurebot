caption: Molecular mechanism mediating endothelial cell senescence and vascular aging.
  SIRT1 protects against endothelial dysfunction by deacetylating eNOS and increasing
  endothelial NO bioavailability. SIRT1 also protects vascular inflammation by suppressing
  NF-κB signaling and exerts anti-oxidant action by increasing Foxo and down-regulating
  p66shc. Under conditions of age-related overexpression, miR-217 suppresses SIRT1
  production. Klotho increases MnSOD activity and NO availability by negatively downregulating
  IGF-1 signaling. H2O2 induces endothelial cell (EC) senescence via downregulation
  of SIRT6 levels. SIRT6 deficiency raises the expression of endothelial proinflammatory
  cytokines and increases NF-κB transcriptional activity. Increased oxidative stress
  due to NRF2 deficiency promotes EC senescence. mTORC1 increases EC senescence through
  the PI3K/AKT pathway and mTORC2 induces EC senescence by suppressing NRF2 production
  via the AKT/GSK-3β/CEBPα signaling pathway. IGFBP1 and IGFBP5 induce senescence
  in HUVECs through AKT or p53-dependent mechanism. IGFBP3 promotes EC senescence
  by inhibiting the SIRT1-Foxo axis, ARB inhibits Ang II-induced EC senescence, and
  FGF21 represses EC senescence via inhibiting p53 signaling pathway in an AMPK-dependent
  manner.
