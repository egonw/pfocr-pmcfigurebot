caption: 'Effect of ICS II on the protein expressions of PPARα, PPARβ, PPARγ, and
  NF-κB signaling pathway in the liver of db/db mice. Representative western blot
  and quantitation of PPARα (a), PPARβ (b), and PPARγ (c) protein expressions in the
  liver (n = 5). (d) Representative western blot of phosphorylation of IKKβ protein
  level and quantitation of phosphorylation of IKKβ protein level in the liver. (e)
  Representative western blot of IκB-α protein expression and quantitation of IκB-α
  protein expression in the liver. (f) Representative western blot of phosphorylation
  of NF-κB (p65) protein level and quantitation of phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65)
  protein level in the liver (n = 5). Serum inflammatory factors were measured, including
  TNF-α (g), IL-1β (h), and IL-6 (i) (n = 8). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. **
  p < 0.01 versus WT group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus db/db group.'
