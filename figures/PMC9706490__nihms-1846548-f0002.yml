caption: Four strains of mice (C57Bl/6, TLR-3Lps-d, MD-2−/−, and CD-14−/−) were exposed
  to 300 EU of lipoöligosaccharide from Neisseria meningitidis alone (LOS) or complexed
  with MD-2 (LOS:MD-2) or received vehicle control (CNTL) by intranasal instillation.
  Neutrophils () and cytokines (TNF-α,  and IL-6, ) in bronchoalveolar lavage were
  measured. Mice deficient in CD-14 did not mount an inflammatory response to the
  LOS alone nor to the monomeric LOS:MD-2 complex. Similarly, TLR-4 deficient mice
  had limited responses. The MD-2−/− mice did not respond to the LOS but demonstrated
  a robust response to the LOS:MD-2 showing that exogenously-administered MD-2 complexed
  with endotoxin could restore the pathway to inflammation.
