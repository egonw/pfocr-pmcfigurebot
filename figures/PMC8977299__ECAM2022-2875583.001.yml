caption: Expression of Sca-1+ in separated and purified cells. By further using adhesion
  magnetic beads purification, 83.32% of Sca-1+ HSC/HPCs was also obtained, which
  was 74.15% higher than the purity without purification. (a-1, b-1) merged picture
  of light microscope and Sca-1+ (green) fluorescent staining. (a-2, b-2) Sca-1+ (green)
  fluorescent staining. (a) Without purification. (b) Purified cells, Bar = 50 μm.
