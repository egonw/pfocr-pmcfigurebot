caption: 'Overexpression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in GL261 LDH-A KD cells.
  A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for a single pathway (Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR) pathway) is shown for each GBM cell line (A). Transcripts per million
  (TPM) expression values were plotted in individual cell lines for genes directly
  involved in PPAR pathway, showing significant upregulation of these genes in (B).
  The Z-transformed scores of individual genes within the PPAR pathway were plotted
  across each GBM cell line (GL261, CT2A and ALTS1C1). The experiment performed with
  triplicates, with rows representing each sample, and columns representing individual
  genes, shows the greatest enrichment in GL261 LDH-A KD cells (C). Expression (TPM)
  of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1A) is shown for each cell line (D). CPT1A
  is a mitochondrial enzyme that allows for subsequent movement of acyl carnitine
  from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria, playing an important
  role in fatty-acid metabolism. Significant differences are indicated by: * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. (D,E) Overexpression of genes involved in lipid
  metabolism (PPAR signaling pathway) in LDHA KD glioma cells.  provides the semi-raw
  data from the RNASeq analysis that was used to generate the figures.'
