caption: ptsI deficiency associated with a metabolic flux shift and down-regulation
  of ATP synthesis. (A) Effects of a deficiency in ptsI on ciprofloxacin-induced (5×
  MIC) expression of genes involved in metabolic flux (glycolysis, PPP, TCA cycle)
  and oxidative phosphorylation. Shown are genes up-regulated (orange; number in parenthesis
  represents log2 increase) or down-regulated (blue; number in parenthesis represent
  log2 decrease) by greater than twofold in the indicated metabolic pathways, as revealed
  by RNA-seq analysis. (B) Deficiency in ptsI restricts the increase in cellular ATP
  level stimulated by phenol or ciprofloxacin. Wild-type and ΔptsI-mutant cells were
  treated with 3.5 mg/mL phenol for 20 min or 5× MIC ciprofloxacin for 60 min. ATP
  levels were determined and expressed as pmol/106 cells. Data are averages of three
  biological replicates; error bars indicate SEM. (C) Suppression of ciprofloxacin-mediated
  up-regulation of ATP synthase genes by a deficiency in ptsI. Ciprofloxacin treatment
  at 5× MIC for 90 min up-regulated all eight genes encoding ATP synthases in wild-type
  cells; a deficiency in ptsI inhibited all up-regulation and suppressed atpC expression,
  as revealed by RNA-seq analysis. Panel shows comparisons; far right bar shows color
  scale. See SI Appendix, Fig. S7 for supporting information.
