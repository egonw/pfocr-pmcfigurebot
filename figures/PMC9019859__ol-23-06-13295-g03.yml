caption: KLF10 binds to ACSM3 and promotes the transcription of ACSM3. (A) The Gene
  Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis website revealed the expression levels
  of ACSM3. (B) The association between ACSM3 expression and overall survival rate
  in melanoma patients, (C) the association of ACSM3 and disease-free survival rate
  in patients with melanoma, and (D) the association between KLF10 expression and
  ACSM3 expression in patients with melanoma were examined. (E) Western blotting and
  (F) RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of ACSM3 in melanoma cells.
  (G) JASPAR predicted the binding sites of KLF10 and the ACSM3 promoter. (H) Luciferase
  reporter gene assay was used to detect the ACSM3 promoter activity. (I) Immunoprecipitation
  further indicated that KLF10 could bind with ACSM3. (J) Western blotting and (K)
  RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of ACSM3 after KLF10 overexpression.
