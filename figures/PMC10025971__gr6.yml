caption: Integrated analysis of CPI-associated sensitivity to drug response and its
  potential therapeutic value in immunotherapy(A) Spearman correlation of CPI with
  drugs collected from the GDSC database across 26 cancer types. Red indicates a positive
  correlation (drug-resistant), while blue indicates a negative correlation (drug-sensitive).
  The bars on the right indicate the number of drugs associated with CPI in each tumor
  type. Red indicates the count of drug-resistant cells, while blue indicates the
  count of drug-sensitive cells. Signaling pathways targeted by drugs that are resistant
  (B) or sensitive (C) to CPI. Drug names are listed on the horizontal axis, and the
  signaling pathway targeted by the drug is listed on the vertical axis. The bar graph
  on the right shows the number of drugs targeting each pathway. The color of the
  point indicates the coefficient of the correlation. (E and F) Kaplan-Meier curve
  showing a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the high- and
  low-CPI groups with (D, left) urothelial cancer patients in the IMvigor210 database
  and (E, left) GBM patients in the PRJNA482620 database. Stacked graphs show the
  proportions of (D, right) urothelial cancer and (E, right) GBM patients who responded
  to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in the low- and high-CPI groups.(F) Kaplan-Meier curve
  shows a significant difference in (top) OS and (middle) progression-free survival
  (PFS) between the high- and low-CPI groups of SKCM patients in the GSE100797 dataset,
  and (bottom) stacked graphs show the proportions of SKCM patients who responded
  to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in the low- and high-CPI groups.(G–J) SKCM patients who
  were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, single, or combined) were
  collected from the phs000452.v3 p1, GSE91061, and ERP105482 datasets. (Left) The
  Kaplan-Meier curve shows a significant difference in OS between the high- and low-CPI
  groups of SKCM patients. (Right) Proportions of SKCM patients who responded to ICIs
  in the low- and high-CPI groups. The significance of differences between the groups
  were determined by the log-rank test.
