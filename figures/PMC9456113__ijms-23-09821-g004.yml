caption: KEGG pathway map of arginine and proline metabolism. Metabolites in blue,
  yellow, and red have lower, the same, and higher concentrations, respectively, in
  OBM compared to OBO. Non-colored metabolites were not part of the metabolomics profile.
  The box plots show distribution of significant metabolites (p < 0.05) in the pathway.
  The box plots are supplemented with violin plots to show distribution of samples
  across different MS.
