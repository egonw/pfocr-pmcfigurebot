caption: MiR‐1253 could directly target NOVA2. (a) The binding sites between miR‐1253
  and NOVA2 3′UTR were presented. (b), (c) The interaction between miR‐1253 and NOVA2
  was confirmed using dual‐luciferase reporter assay. (d) The mRNA expression of NOVA2
  in 36 paired LC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by qRT‐PCR.
  (e) The correlation between miR‐1253 and NOVA2 in LC tumor tissues was analyzed
  by Pearson correlation analysis. (f) WB analysis was used to assess NOVA2 protein
  expression in three paired LC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. (g) The
  protein expression of NOVA2 in HBE cells and LC cells (A549 and H1299) was determined
  by WB analysis. (h) The transfection efficiencies of miR‐1253 mimic and inhibitor
  were evaluated by detecting miR‐1253 expression using qRT‐PCR. (i) A549 and H1299
  cells were transfected with miR‐NC, miR‐1253, anti‐miR‐NC or anti‐miR‐1253. The
  protein expression of NOVA2 was tested by WB analysis. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
