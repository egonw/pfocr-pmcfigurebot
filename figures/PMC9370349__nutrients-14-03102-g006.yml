caption: Related protein expression of Keap1/Nrf2/TXNIP signaling pathway. (A) WB
  results for Keap1, Nrf2 and TXNIP; (B) change in Keap1 protein expression relative
  to β-actin in different groups; (C) change in Nrf2 protein expression relative to
  β-actin in different groups; (D) change in TXNIP protein expression relative to
  β-actin in different groups. The value of the bars indicates the means ± SD (n =
  at least 3). The same letter means there is no significant difference, and different
  letters mean there is a significant difference (p < 0.05).
