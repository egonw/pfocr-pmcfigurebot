caption: Root-associated hormonal signaling model for drought stress tolerance. In
  drought, plants induce abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis genes to produce large amounts
  of ABA in plant roots [,]. ABA synthesized in large quantities is directly involved
  in the drought-tolerant metabolism of plants through the process of ABA signaling.
  ABA activates the ARF transcription factor related to auxin in response to increased
  drought tolerance in roots, and cytokinin antagonizes ABA []. In addition, the ABA-independent
  pathway activates the ethylene signal transduction transcription factor to help
  the root development [,].
