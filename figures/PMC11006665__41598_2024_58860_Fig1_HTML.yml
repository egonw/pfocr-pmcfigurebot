caption: (a) Schematic representation of co-culture between stromal cells (HS-5) and
  leukemic cells (NB4). The stromal cells were subjected to GEP analysis at the end
  of 48 h. (b) Volcano plot showing the differentially regulated genes in stromal
  cells upon leukemic cell interaction. (c) DAVID pathway analysis showed an enrichment
  of osteoblast differentiation-related genes and Wnt signaling pathways. (d) Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis indicated an enrichment of osteoblast differentiation
  pathway in stromal cells upon co-culture. (e) Heat map demonstrates osteoblast-associated
  (differentially regulated) genes enriched in stromal cells upon co-culture with
  leukemic cells (n = 3).
