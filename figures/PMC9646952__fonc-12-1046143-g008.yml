caption: Immunohistochemical analysis of PI3K and Akt in tumor tissues treated with
  PD and/or CTX. (A) Images of immunohistochemically stained tissues. The left column
  shows proteins in each tumor type. The top row shows drug treatments with different
  combinations. Scale bars, 100 μm. (B) Quantitation of positive staining for p-Akt,
  p-PI3K, Akt, and PI3K in every group. Graph of percentage of positive cells for
  immunohistochemical staining (three random fields). ImageJ was used to quantify
  the positive immunohistochemical staining results (n=3). Data are shown as the mean
  ± S.D. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze P values between groups. All groups are
  compared with the ‘Control’ group, and the ‘CTX’ group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’
  group. *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
