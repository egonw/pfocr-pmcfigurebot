caption: Schematic presentation showing rotenone-induced toxicity in SN neurons. Reactive
  astrocytes/microglia were detected after rotenone administration in Lewis rats.
  Both calpain-1 and calpain-2 were also activated in the nigrostriatal pathway following
  rotenone administration in rats. Calpain inhibition may help reduce glial activation
  via reduction of ROS and differentiation of microglia into M2-type cells. Decreased
  phagocytic function of glia and selective autophagy may also support preferential
  regulation of calpain-1 and calpain-2 expression/activity and the fate of neuronal
  survival in PD.
