figure_title: AP-MS spectrometry reveals NTRK2 splice variant interactors associated
  with developmental and oncogenic pathways
caption: '3T3 cells were transduced with TrkB.T1-HA or TrkB.FL-HA, each in triplicate,
  and subjected to HA pull-down to identify direct and indirect interactors via AP-MS
  as shown in fig. S3 and dataset S1. Proteins specific to each isoform and shared
  between both isoforms (with serum: n = 599 for TrkB.T1, n = 399 for TrkB.FL, and
  n = 749 shared; without serum: n = 720 for TrkB.T1, n = 110 for TrkB.FL, and n =
  163 shared) were subjected to GO and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis to find
  proteins associated with developmental, oncogenic, and cell cycle/cell division
  pathways. *Developmental, oncogenic, and cell cycle/cell divisionâ€“associated signaling
  pathways listed are associated under normal culture conditions (with serum) unless
  shown with asterisk, which denotes that proteins associated with these pathways
  were found both under normal culture conditions and serum-starved conditions.'
