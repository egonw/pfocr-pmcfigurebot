caption: Synthesis of EMT signalling in cSCC based on clinical and experimental studies
  evaluated in this review (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). The signalling investigated
  by cell line-based studies was merged in this EMT pathway map under the assumption
  of transferability between the different aetiologies and models. Multiple changes
  can induce EMT in cSCC. Hormonal, cytokine, growth factor, ECM signalling all contribute
  cooperatively to the extent and nature of the EMT programme. Central signalling
  hubs such as Akt, MKKs or NFκB are attractive drug targets that could be used to
  attenuate EMT in cSCC []
