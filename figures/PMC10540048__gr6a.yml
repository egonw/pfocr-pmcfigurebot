caption: 'IRIN silicasome plus radiation therapy activated TIME that led to a robust
  efficacy via further combination with anti-PD-1 (A) Flow cytometry of CD4+ and CD8+
  T cells in tumors received different treatments. Dot plots show the proportion of
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. (B) Flow cytometry of CD11c+ DC cells in different groups.
  (C–D) Quantitation of the percentage of CD4+ T cells (C) and CD8+ T cells (D) among
  CD45+ T cells (n = 3). (E) Quantitation of the percentage of CD11c+ DC cells among
  non-macrophages (n = 3). (F) Multicolor immunofluorescence staining of tumors with
  different treatments. Green: CD4. Red: CD8. Yellow: IFN-γ. Blue: DAPI. Scale bar:
  50 μm. (G–I) Quantitation of the amount of CD4 (G), CD8 (H), and IFN-γ (I) protein
  expression levels in integrated option density (IOD) by ImageJ software. Each group
  consisted of three mice. (J) Tumor volume of MC38 subcutaneous xenograft tumor in
  different treatment groups (n = 6). Mice were treated with IRIN silicasome at an
  IRIN equivalent dose of 40 mg/kg IV every 3 days with a total of four administrations
  (red arrow). Radiation therapy was performed on the day after chemotherapy (blue
  arrow). The dose was 2 Gy per fraction with a total of 4 fractions. 100 μg anti-PD-1
  antibody was injected IP on the day after radiation therapy for a total of 3 administrations
  (green arrow). Data were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s test. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
