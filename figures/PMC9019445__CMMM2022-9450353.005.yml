caption: Linc00261 suppressed the HGSOC progression via miR-552-ATG10-EMT pathway.
  (a) qRT-PCR validated that miR-552 inhibitor reversed the Linc00261 knockdown mediated
  expression level of miR-552 and ATG10. (b) and (c) miR-552 inhibitor reduced the
  cell proliferation and migration capability after Linc00261 knockdown via CCK-8
  and transwell assays. (d) The relationship between mRNA expressions of ATG10 and
  Linc00261 in 23 pairs of HGSOC tissues was detected. (e) and (f) mRNA and protein
  levels of EMT markers were detected to verify the function of miR-552 inhibitor
  reversed the Linc00261 knockdown mediated EMT progression. (g) and (h) qRT-PCR and
  Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the function of ATG10 knockdown
  on Linc00261 overexpression mediated EMT progression. Data are reported as means
  ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
