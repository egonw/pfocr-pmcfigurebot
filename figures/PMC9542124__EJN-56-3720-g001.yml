caption: 'GC‐C mRNA is localised in peri‐ischaemic cortical astrocytes but not in
  the contralateral hemisphere of wild‐type (WT) mice 48 h after MCAO. RNAScope® assay
  with a GC‐C probe was performed along with immunohistochemical staining with a GFAP
  antibody in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. GC‐C mRNA was expressed
  in peri‐ischaemic astrocytes (Merged3, white arrows), whereas GC‐C was not present
  in astrocytes of the contralateral hemisphere (Merged2, white arrows). Merged1:
  merged images of GC‐C, GFAP and DAPI staining; bar represents 50 μm. Merged2 and
  Merged3: the enlarged images of astrocytes in the contralateral cortex and a peri‐ischaemic
  area, respectively, stained with DAPI, GC‐C and GFAP; bar represents 20 μm. DAPI,
  4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole; GC‐C, guanylate cyclase C; GFAP, glial fibrillary
  acidic protein'
