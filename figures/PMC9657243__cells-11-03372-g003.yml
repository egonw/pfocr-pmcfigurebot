caption: (a). means (SE) of phosphorylated (p) and total (t) levels of IGF-1/insulin
  cascade-associated proteins measured in extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal
  origin (NEVs) at baseline (visit 1 t0 (V1)), 24 h after the first dose (visit 2
  t24 (V2)), and 24 h after the last dose (visit 3 t24 (V3)). Statistical analysis
  involved repeated-measures linear mixed models with “Visit” as the repeated-measures
  variable and additional variables as factors and covariates (see  for details).
  Significance is indicated as *, corresponding to p ≤ 0.05. (b). IGF-1/insulin signaling
  in neurons reflecting acute biomarker changes detected in NEVs. Significant increases
  are marked with * [].
