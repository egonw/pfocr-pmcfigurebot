caption: Elevated S100A16 expression in RCC. (a) S100A16 expression in renal clear
  cell carcinoma. (b) Expression of S100A16 in RCC unpaired tissues (tumor 539-normal
  72). (c) S100A16 expression in paired RCC and normal tissue (tumor 72 -normal 72).
  (d) S100A16 ROC analysis demonstrated ability to distinguish between tumor and normal
  tissues. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Relationship between S100A16 in TCGA
  database and clinical data of RCC.
