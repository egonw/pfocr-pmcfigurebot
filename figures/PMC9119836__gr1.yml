caption: IPO7 expression in PC tissues and cell lines. (A‒B) IPO7 expression was up-regulated
  in PC tissues and the expression of IPO7 was correlated with the prognosis of PC
  patients by searching the Gene Expression Analysis Interactive Analysis (GEIPA)
  database. (C‒D). Immunohistochemistry showed that IPO7 was highly expressed in PC
  tissues. (E) qRT-PCR showed that IPO7 mRNA expression was up-regulated in PC tissues.
  F-G. qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed that IPO7 expression was up-regulated in 4 PC
  cell lines (PANC-1, HPAC, BxPC-3 and Capan-2) compared with the normal pancreatic
  ductal epithelial cell line (hTERT-HPNE). All of the experiments were performed
  in triplicate (**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
