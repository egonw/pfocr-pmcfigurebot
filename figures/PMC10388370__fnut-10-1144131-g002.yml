caption: Venn diagram for the BMI-associated signal/metabolites (A) and the enriched
  pathways (B) in women with- and without HDP. (A) The BMI-associated signals (the
  first number) and identified/annotated metabolites (the second number) determined
  in women (A) with- and without HDP; (B) without HDP only; (C) with HDP only. The
  association was determined by the linear regression models (p < 0.05 and corrected
  by FDR) adjusting for maternal age, whether they smoked more than 100 cigarettes
  in their lifetime, and gestational week when serum samples and BMI were obtained.
  Signals and the identified (or annotated) metabolites corresponding to (A) were
  summarized in . (B) The enriched BMI-associated pathway for women (A) with and without
  HDP, (B) without HDP only, and (C) with HDP only by Metaboanalyst 5.0 (Funtional
  Analysis MS peak module). The list of pathways corresponding to (B) were summarized
  in . No covariates was adjusted for data used for pathway enrichment.
