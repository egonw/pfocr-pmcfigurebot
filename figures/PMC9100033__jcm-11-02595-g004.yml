caption: 'Impact of the in-utero environment on fetal calcium homeostasis in calcium-hyposensitivity
  disorders. If the fetus is affected by heterozygous CaSR mutations, fetal and maternal
  calcium needs are concordant (left panel). If the maternal environment is normocalcemic
  (middle panel) but the fetus affected by a paternally derived or de-novo mutation
  in CaSR, the maternal environment is perceived as hypocalcemic by the fetus and
  PTH stimulation arises resulting in NHPT. If both parents are affected by FHH (right
  panel), the fetus may inherit both mutations and a most severe stimulation of PTH
  and hypercalcemia arises, a NSHPT. Abbreviations: FHH, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia;
  WT, wild type; NHPT, neonatal hyperparathyroidism; NSHPT, neonatal severe primary
  hyperparathyroidism.'
