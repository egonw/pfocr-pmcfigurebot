caption: MiR-107 inhibitor reversed the effect of si-TTN-AS1 in MCF-7/TAM. A. MiR-107
  knockdown led to augmented invasion of MCF-7/TAM induced by si-TTN-AS1. B, C. miR-107
  inhibitor reduced proportion of apoptotic cells and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest influenced
  by si-TTN-AS1. All data are represented as mean Â± SD. Each assay was performed in
  triplicate. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
