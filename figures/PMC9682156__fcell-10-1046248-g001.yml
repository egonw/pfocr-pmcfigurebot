caption: Primary cilium and autophagy in the regulation of cell fate. Shear stress
  in kidney epithelial cells (Green arrows) activates the folliculin (FLCN)/LKB1/AMPK/mTORC1
  cascade to induce on one hand mitochondria biogenesis and on the other hand autophagy/lipophagy
  to regulate cell size and to produce fatty acids from lipid droplets (LDs) degradation,
  which will be used by mitochondria for ATP synthesis. This energy production favorizes
  the kidney epithelial cells metabolic reprogramming to control many activities,
  e.g., glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis. Stretch in trabecular meshwork cells
  (Purple arrows) activates the SMAD2/3 pathway and inhibits the Akt/PKB signaling,
  to positively regulate autophagy and control intraocular pressure homeostasis. Neuronal
  primary cilium (Red arrows) can regulate cell metabolism by the melanocortin 4 receptor
  (MC4R) or Insulin receptor (IR), which control cAMP production via type III adenylyl
  cyclase (ACE3) and Akt signaling, respectively. In embryonic stem cells (Blue arrows),
  a primary cilium-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor
  2 (Nrf2) promotes their differentiation towards a neuroectodermal fate.
