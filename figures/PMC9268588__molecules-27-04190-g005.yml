caption: Vimentin and NF-κB signaling pathway are essential for the EV-71-induced
  inflammasome activation. (a) The expressions of NLRP3 and caspase-1 protein detected
  by Western blotting between VIM+/+ cells and VIM−/− cells. (b,c) Optical density
  analysis of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 by Western blotting. (d) Western blot detected the
  NLRP3 and caspase-1 protein expression among VIM+/+ cells, VIM−/− cells and CAPE
  cells. (e,f) NLRP3 or Caspase-1 and β-actin ratio analyzed by gray analysis of Western
  immunoblotting. * p < 0.05.
