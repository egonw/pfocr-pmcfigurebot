caption: Reduced expression of CD70 in CMV-specific CD8+ TCM cells. A Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) identified genes in pathway negatively regulating MAPK activity
  which is enriched in CMV-specific TCM cells. B Heatmap showing genes in pathway
  negatively regulating MAPK activity differentially express between CMV-specific
  and IAV-specific TCM cells from duplicated microarray experiments. C The expression
  level of CD70 in CMV- and IAV-specific TCM cells analyzed by RT-PCR. D Representative
  flow cytometry plots showing gating on CD70 expression in CMV- and IAV-specific
  CD8+ T cells. (E) Frequencies of CD70+ cells in CMV- and IAV-specific TN (N=32)
  and TCM (N=33) cells from CMV IgG positive healthy adults. * Indicates P < 0.05
article_title: Cytomegalovirus infection reduced CD70 expression, signaling and expansion
  of viral specific memory CD8+ T cells in healthy human adults.
