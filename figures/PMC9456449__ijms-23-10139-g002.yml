caption: Retinal fluid regulation pathway. Under normal conditions, water accumulates
  in the retina due to (1) metabolic activity, (2) influx from blood, and (3) influx
  from the vitreous chamber. MÃ¼ller glia and RPE cells are responsible for water clearance
  from the inner and outer retina, respectively. This transcellular water transport
  is facilitated by the AQP4 water channel and is coupled to transport of potassium
  ions (K+) through the K+ channel. Figure inspired from [].
