caption: MicroRNAs regulate the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. RIG-I and MDA5
  recognize a complementary set of viral cytosolic dsRNA ligands. Their activation
  is tightly regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and host proteins such
  as LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 signal to MAVS, and then induce NF-κB and IRF3/7 to enter
  the nucleus, which promotes the release of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines.
  The activity of RIG-I and MDA5 can be regulated by several E3 ubiquitin ligases,
  including TRIM25 and RNF123. The circled ‘P’ indicates phosphorylation, and the
  circled ‘Ub’ indicates ubiquitination. MiR-BART6–3p, miR-4423–3p, miR-340–5p, miR-545,
  miR-145, miR-146a, miR-218, miR-485, miR-149, miR-92a, and miR-582–3p target RIG-I;
  miR-34b-5p, miR-203, and miR-145-5p target MDA5; miR-122 targets DAK to inhibit
  the expression of MDA5; miR-30a and miR-202-5p target TRIM25; miR-155 and miR-33
  target AMPK; miR-200c targets CNTN1 to regulate MAVS, while miR-3570 directly targets
  MAVS; miR-489 and miR-146a-5p target TRAF6; and miR-9–5p targets NF-κB. MicroRNA
  let-7b targets IKKα. These microRNAs directly or indirectly regulate the RIG-I-like
  receptor signaling pathway to play antiviral, antitumor, or immunomodulatory roles.
