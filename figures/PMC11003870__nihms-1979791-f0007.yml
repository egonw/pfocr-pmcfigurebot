figure_title: Human autoimmune alopecia demonstrates a heightened IL-2 signaling gene
  signature around hair follicles
caption: A, E. Medium-power photomicrographs of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
  tissue sections representative of regions of pathology in human scarring alopecia
  (SA), alopecia areata (AA) and corresponding regions in healthy scalp skin (HS)
  as denoted by the dashed boxes in  and . In (A), arrowheads indicate lymphocytic
  inflammation around hair follicles, and asterisks indicate perifollicular fibrosis.
  In (E), arrowheads indicate lymphocytic inflammation around hair follicles, and
  asterisks indicate involutional hair follicles. Bar = 50 Î¼m. B, F. Medium-power
  images of spatial transcriptomic (ST) feature plots of the IL2-STAT5 pathway, and
  CD8 and Treg gene signatures superimposed on the corresponding H&E images in (A)
  and (E). C, H. Unsupervised clustering of ST data from two samples of SA and two
  samples of HS, and two samples of AA and two samples of HS as demonstrated in  and
  . D, I. Feature plots of SA, AA, and HS spatial transcriptomic data displaying the
  IL2-STAT5 pathway, and CD8 T cell and Treg gene signatures. E, J. Violin plots of
  the IL2-STAT5 pathway in ST clusters representative of microanatomic stromal niches
  in diseased and healthy skin. Bar represents mean. Horizontal triangle in greyscale
  denotes decreasing expression score moving left to right. Data are representative
  of one independent 10X Visium capture area each for the scarring alopecia TMA sample
  and the alopecia areata TMA sample.
