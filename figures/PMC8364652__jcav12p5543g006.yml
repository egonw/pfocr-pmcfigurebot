caption: ROS utilize the antioxidant system, DNA damage repair pathway, and metabolic
  reprogramming to inhibit the accumulation of ROS and repair ROS-induced damage.
  ROS activate NRF2, thereby promoting the expression of NQO1, CAT, SOD1/2 and PRDX1/3,
  and decreasing ROS levels. ROS activate the expression of KLF14 via the PI3K/Akt,
  p42/p44 MAPK, AMPK, and PKC pathways; KLF14 then couples with p300 and CBP, and
  promotes the expression of HO-1, which restores cellular redox balance. ROS accumulation
  inhibits PKM2, thus leading to G-6-P flux into the PPP and generating sufficient
  NADPH to produce GSH, thereby maintaining ROS homeostasis. ROS trigger LIPG upregulation
  and induce the lipolysis of extracellular lipoproteins to compensate for the ROS-impeded
  fatty acid synthesis pathway. The upregulated LIPG also protects against oxidative
  damage via the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets. ROS activate KRAS/AMPK
  signaling, thus inducing metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis. ROS
  activate ATM, which in turn phosphorylates BRCA1 and triggers HR for DNA repair
  and activation of P53, which in turn triggers the NER pathway. ROS activate the
  ATM-chk2 and ATR-chk1 axis, thereby causing cell cycle arrest of cancer cells, preventing
  the cells from undergoing mitosis and favoring DNA repair. NQO1, NADH dehydrogenase,
  quinone 1; CAT, catalase; PKC, protein kinase C; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway.
