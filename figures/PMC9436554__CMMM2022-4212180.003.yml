caption: 'GO/KEGG enrichment analyses of ERS-DEGs. (a) Advanced bubble chart shows
  GO functional enrichment significance items of ERS-DEGs in three functional groups:
  BP, MF, and CC. The x-axis and y-axis labels represent the gene ratios enriched
  in the GO analysis group and GO terms, respectively. The color of dots represents
  the adjusted p value: the redder the color, the lesser the adj. p value; the bluer
  the color, the greater the adj. p value. The size of dots represents gene counts.
  (bâ€“d) Chord diagrams show the distribution of ERS-DEGs in the three different GO-enriched
  functions. The color of dots represents the log FC of the genes. (e) Advanced bubble
  chart shows enrichment of ERS-DEGs in signal pathways. (f) The chord diagram shows
  the distribution of ERS-DEGs in different KEGG pathways. (g) The pathway diagram
  shows the immune response-activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway with
  the highest enrichment degree in GO analysis. (h) The pathway diagram shows that
  the leishmaniasis pathway has the highest enrichment degree in KEGG analysis.'
