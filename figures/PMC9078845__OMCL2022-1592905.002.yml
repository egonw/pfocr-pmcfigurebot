caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction potentially promoted the hepatocarcinogenesis.
  (a) Transcriptional profiling of HCC and adjacent paired normal tissues. (b) Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and adjacent paired normal tissues. Red dots
  represented significant upregulation and blue dots represented significant downregulation
  of DEGs in HCC tissues. (c) Identification of biological functions via the GO pathway
  enrichment analysis.
