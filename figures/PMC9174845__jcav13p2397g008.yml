caption: RNA editing regulate R-Loop formation. (A) Cells growth curve of SKOV3 with
  scramble shRNA and SKOV3 with ADAR1shRNA. SKOV3 with ADAR1 shRNA were transfected
  with human ADAR1 plasmid or human mutation ADAR1. (B) Phosphorylation of Chk1 and
  H2A.X were detected via Western blot in ADAR1 knockdown cells. ADAR1 knockdown cells
  were transfected. (C) Quantification of mean intensity of DNA/RNA hybrid (S9.6 antibody)
  in SKOV3. All data were shown as mean Â± SD in n > 90 cells (***, P < 0.001; **,
  P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05).
