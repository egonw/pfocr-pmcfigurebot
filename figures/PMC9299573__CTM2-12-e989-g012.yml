caption: miR‐20a‐containing exosomes derived from cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
  regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway in vivo to promote non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  tumour growth and chemoresistance. Nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with
  HCC827 cells treated using PBS, normal tissue‐associated fibroblasts (NAFs), CAF
  or CAFs‐shRab27a. Mice were then randomized into DDP treatment and untreated control
  groups. (A) Images of representative xenograft tumours. (B) Tumour volumes were
  analysed once weekly beginning 1 week after implantation. (C) The expression of
  miR‐20a was assessed via qPCR in tumours from untreated mice. (D) The expression
  of miR‐20a was assessed via qPCR in tumours from DDP‐treated mice. (E) PTEN, PI3K‐p85,
  PI3K‐p100, PI3K, pAKT and AKT were analysed via Western blotting in tumour‐bearing
  mice. (F) Tumours from xenograft model mice were subjected to Ki‐67 and TUNEL staining
  to analyse apoptotic cell death (200x), with the positive staining area being quantified
  in (G and H). Results are representative data from triplicate experiments, and outcomes
  are means ± standard deviation (SD) (*p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001)
