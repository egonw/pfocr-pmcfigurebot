caption: Biogenesis and regulatory pathways of let-7 family members. (a) Let-7 follows
  the typical miRNA biogenesis pathway. (b) TUTases specifically mono-uridylate the
  3′ end of the 1 nt, yielding the 2 nt 3′ overhang preferred by Dicer to facilitate
  processing of pre-let-7. (c) Pre-let-7 is oligonucleotidylated at the 3′ end by
  Lin28A and TUT4/7 and is resistant to cleavage by Dicer but sensitive to catalytic
  degradation by DIS3L2. (d) The methylated Lin28A and Lin28B nucleus bind to pri-let-7
  in the nucleus and segregate it into nucleosomes, preventing Drosha-mediated processing.
