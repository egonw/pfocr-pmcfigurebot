caption: CHI3L1 promotes HCC progression by disturbing LPO metabolism. (A) CHI3L1
  over-expression increased the cellular ROS level in Hep1-6 cells; (B) CHI3L1 promoted
  fat accumulation in Hep1-6 cells, especially in high fatty acid (HF) medium (scale
  bar, 100 μm); (C) LPO staining assay on the Hep1-6 cells identified increased LPO
  accumulation in the CHI3L1 over-expressing cells, especially in high fat medium.
  Tocopherol inhibited LPO synthesis in the Hep1-6 cells; (D) LPO detection kit showed
  increased LPO level in CHI3L1 over-expressing Hep1-6 cells and decreased LPO level
  in CHI3L1 knockdown Hep1-6 cells; (E) LPO inhibition using α-tocopherol can compromise
  pro-proliferative effects of CHI3L1 in Hep1-6 cells; (F) LPO inhibition can compromise
  pro-invasive and migrative effects of CHI3L1 in Hep1-6 cells (scale bar, 200 μm);
  (G) The lipid peroxidation enzymes including LOX and COX2 were up-regulated in the
  CHI3L1 over-expressing Hep1-6 cells; (H) Targeted profiling on 14 metabolites in
  the cholesterol metabolism pathway showed that they were generally down-regulated
  by CHI3L1 (negative control vs CHI3L1 over expression, repeats = 3). Targeted profiling
  of 71 oxylipins identified 22 differential oxylipins, including 20 up-regulated
  and 2 down-regulated by CHI3L1 (negative control vs CHI3L1 over expression, repeats = 3);
  (I) Pathway analysis showed that CHI3L1 altered the level of 5 metabolites in arachidonic
  acid metabolism pathway in the Hep1-6 cells; (J) The schematic diagram. Data represent
  the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.
