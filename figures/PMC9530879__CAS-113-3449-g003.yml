caption: Characteristics of selected patients with breast cancer for generation of
  patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiomyocytes. (A) Flow
  diagram of patient selection. Twenty‐four of 468 patients with breast cancer (5.1%)
  who received trastuzumab (Tmab)‐based treatment were diagnosed with cancer therapy‐related
  cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). Three patients in each group were selected from the
  severely cardiotoxic patient group (SP), patients with a reduced left ventricular
  ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 30% from baseline. (B) Time series of LVEF
  in the six patients. Cardiac‐function values within the yellow background indicate
  that Tmab could not be administered. NP, patients without cardiotoxicity
article_title: Involvement of kallikrein‐PAR2‐proinflammatory pathway in severe trastuzumab‐induced
  cardiotoxicity.
