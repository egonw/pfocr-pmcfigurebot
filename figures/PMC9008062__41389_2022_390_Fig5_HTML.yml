figure_title: AOS-SO4 promotes autophagy and induces apoptosis through the MEK1/ERK/mTOR
  signaling pathway
caption: A KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes in AOS-SO4-treated
  MNNG cells and control cells. B Representative blots showing the protein expression
  of MEK1, p-MEK1 ERK, p-ERK, mTOR, p-mTOR, and LC3B after treatment with AOS-SO4.
  C Osteosarcoma cells were treated with AOS-SO4 for 48 h with or without TBHQ, and
  LC3 puncta were analyzed by the mRFP-GFP-LC3 construct. D Apoptosis was assessed
  by flow cytometry analysis after treatment with AOS-SO4 for 48 h with or without
  TBHQ. E Representative blots of p-ERK, p-mTOR, ULK1, Beclin1, LC3B, and Casp9 in
  MNNG, MG63, and U2OS cells after treated with AOS-SO4 for 48 h with or without TBHQ.
  Data are shown as the means ± SD from at least three independent experiments. Statistical
  analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. Error bars represent the SEM. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01.
