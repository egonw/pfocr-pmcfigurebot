caption: KEGG and GSEA enrichment revealed the related signaling pathways. A. KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. The gradual color represents the Q value, and
  the size of the black spots represents the gene number enriched in this pathway.
  B. GSEA analysis of detected genes between DDP group and CN group. C. GSEA analysis
  of detected genes between CB group and DDP group. KEGG; Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes, GSEA; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, DEGs; Differentially expressed
  genes, CN; Control, CB; Cisplatin combined with NCT503, and DDP; Cisplatin.
