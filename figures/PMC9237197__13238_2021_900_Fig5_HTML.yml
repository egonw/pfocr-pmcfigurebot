caption: 3DCS-HSCs/MPPs possess unique biological characteristics. (A) Volcano Plot
  for DEGs between 3DCS-HSCs/MPPs and mHSCs/MPPs. (B and C) KEGG assay of DEGs between
  3DCS-HSCs/MPPs and mHSCs/MPPs. (D) DEG analysis of volcano and KEGG enrichment for
  3DCS-HSCs/MPPs versus day0-PB-HSCs/MPPs. (E) Heatmap showed the different expression
  values of critical molecules for TNFÂ signaling pathway, lysosome-related pathway
  and ribosomes among 3DCS-HSCs/MPPs, mHSCs/MPPs, and day0-PB-HSCs/MPPs. (F) Volcano
  assay for DEGs between 3DCS-HSCs/MPPs and day0-PB-HSCs/MPPs. (G and H) KEGG enrichment
  analysis revealed different regulation pathways in 3DCS-HSCs/MPPs and day0-PB-HSCs/MPPs.
  (I and J) Volcano and KEGG analysis demonstrated the different gene expression patterns
  and regulation pathways between mHSCs/MPPs, and day0-PB-HSCs/MPPs. Some genes were
  labelled with the cutoff of |avg_log2FC| > = 1.5 and P_val_adj < 0.05
