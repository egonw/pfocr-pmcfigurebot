caption: Autophagy in ovarian tissue was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining
  (A–I) and assessment of the relative fluorescence intensity (J) of LC-3 in the control
  and exposed groups. Additionally, the mRNA levels of the LC-3 gene in female rats
  exposed to allethrin compared with those in the control rats were determined by
  RT–PCR (K). Scale bar = 200 μm. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0001.
