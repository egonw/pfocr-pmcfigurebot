caption: miR-1307-5p inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and elicits
  cell apoptosis of bladder cancer cells in vitro. A Expression of miR-1307-5p in
  T24 and 5637 cells that were transfected with indicated vectors was determined by
  RT–qPCR. B CCK-8 assay was performed on cell proliferation upon transfection with
  miR-1307-5p mimics or inhibitor. C Flow cytometry assay with PI staining was performed
  on cell cycle. D Flow cytometry assay with Annexin V and PI staining was performed
  on cell apoptosis. E Expression of proliferation and apoptosis markers following
  miR-1307-5p stable overexpression or inhibition. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001; ns, no significance. Data depicts the mean ± standard deviation
  and are representative of three independent experiments
