caption: Proteinâ€“Protein Interaction Networks (PPI) prediction. The PPI network between
  the MAPK-signaling-pathway-related genes (A); PI3K-AKT-signaling-pathway-related
  genes (B); and S100a8, S100a9, and their receptor TLR4. The node size represents
  the connectivity degree, and the closer to center, the more critical it is.
article_title: Integrated Analysis Reveals S100a8/a9 Regulates Autophagy and Apoptosis
  through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway in the Early Stage of Myocardial
  Infarction.
