caption: 'Estimated functional heterogeneity and spatial distribution of four prostate
  epithelial cells. (A) Heatmap shows differences in pathway activities scored by
  GSVA per cell between different epithelial cells. (B) Dot plot of gene expression
  levels in each epithelial population for selected genes (prostate stem, lineage,
  NOTCH signaling and neuronal markers). (C) Immunofluorescent labelling of prostate
  stem marker (PSCA, LY6D and SOX2), AR, KLK3 and club (SCGB3A1) cells in prostate
  transitional zone tissues (magnification: 200×; bar: 50 μm; magnification: 800×;
  bar: 20 μm). (D) Correlation of epithelial populations to the transcriptomic signature
  of previously published bulk sequencing data. NEPC Signature (neuroendocrine PCa
  stem cells); LSCmed Cells (castration‐resistant PCa progenitor cells); CFSE high
  cells (normal prostate stem cells); and Luminal 2 (mouse luminal prostate stem cells);
  BPH A and B, and BPH Signature (BPH‐related genes); Basal Trop2+ CD49f hi (basal
  stem cell signature); Luminal Trop2+ CD49f lo (luminal cell signature); Basal signature.
  (E) Upper: Pseudo‐time analysis of epithelial cell state transition in a two‐dimensional
  state space using highly variable genes inferred by Monocle (version 2). Each dot
  corresponds to a single cell, as coloured according to its cluster label. Down:
  Transcriptional activity was estimated by measuring the ratio between unspliced
  and spliced mRNAs. This so‐called RNA velocity is represented by high‐dimensional
  vectors; the longer the arrow in the plot is, the higher the transcriptional activity
  is. (F) Boxplot showing the RNA velocity in the four epithelial cell groups'
