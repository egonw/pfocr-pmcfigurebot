caption: SAMHD1 hydrolyzes deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs), regulates the cell
  cycle, and inhibits innate immunity. SAMHD1 subunit forms tetramer mediates by GTP/dGTP
  binding to SAMHD1 guanine-specific allosteric sites (A1) and dNTPs binding to allosteric
  sites (A2). SAMHD1 tetramers are phosphorylated by the cyclinA2/CDK complex in S/G2
  transition to inhibit SAMHD1 dNTPase activity and are dephosphorylated by protein
  phosphatase 2A (PP2A). SAMHD1 hydrolyzes dNTPs into deoxynucleoside and triphosphate
  to keep the intracellular balance of the dNTPs pool. SAMHD1 restricts retrovirus
  infections at reverse transcription stage by depleting intracellular dNTPs. SAMHD1
  inhibits innate immunity by suppressing virus DNA replication in the cytoplasm and
  by keeping cytoplasm single-strand DNA at a low level insufficient to initiate cGAS-STING
  pathway to induce type Ι interferon secretion. SAMHD1 inhibits the TRAF6-TAK1axis
  to inhibit activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. SAMHD1 binds the CtBP-interacting
  protein (CtIP) to mediate DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection to initiate
  DNA homologous recombination repair. pSAMHD1, phosphorylated SAMHD1; TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6); transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1); IKK, inhibitor
  of kappa B kinase; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; cGAMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine
  monophosphate; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor.
