caption: LDHA overexpression induced metabolic reprogramming in CMs.(A) Schematic
  diagram of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. (B) Heatmap showing 30 metabolites concentration
  in P7 CMs after LDHA overexpression. The metabolites marked in red are significantly
  changed. (C–D) The levels of β-F6P, DHAP, pyruvate, lactate, suc-CoA and succinate
  detected in P7 CMs after LDHA overexpression. n = 6 cell samples. (E) Volcano plot
  displaying the differentially expressed proteins in P7 CMs after LDHA overexpression.
  (F–G) GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyzed the differentially expressed proteins
  after LDHA overexpression. (H) GSEA was performed to analyze clusters of genes that
  regulate the cell cycle. (I–K) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed proteins
  related to the cell cycle, glucose metabolic process and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Statistical significance was calculated using an unpaired t-test in C-D; *P < 0.05.
  FC indicated fold change. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
