caption: Optimization of RANKL incubation time and liposomal CRE-SD concentration.
  In the first study, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 20 ng/mL RANKL and CRE-SD-free
  POPC liposomes (CRE-SD-FREE-LIP) for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days to detect (A) TRAP activity
  and (B) the relative expression of cathepsin K (CTSK). Statistically significant
  differences in cell samples between any incubation day and incubation day 0 are
  indicated with an asterisk (*). In the second study, RAW 264.7 cells were treated
  with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and liposomal CRE-SD (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 µg/mL) and
  incubated for 5 days with and without 20 ng/mL RANKL to estimate (C) the number
  of viable cells. Statistical significance of the difference between the corresponding
  liposomal CRE-SD-treated and CRE-SD-FREE-LIP-treated samples is denoted as * p <
  0.05, n = 3.
