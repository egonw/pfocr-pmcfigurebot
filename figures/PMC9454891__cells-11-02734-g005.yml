caption: Measurement of ROS levels in Hep3B cells. (a) Changes in ROS production were
  detected by DCFDA fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microscope. (b) Levels
  of ROS generation were measured by fluorescent intensity detection in apigetrin-treated
  Hep3B cells. Values are given as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. control, *** p < 0.001 vs. control.
