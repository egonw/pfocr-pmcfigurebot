caption: 'The contribution of the JAK-STAT pathway to enhanced EMT, enrichment of
  CSCs, and tumor progression after ERKi treatment. (A-B) Activation of JAK-STAT signaling
  after ERKi treatment. A549 and HCC827 cells were treated with BVD or SCH at 2.5
  µM for 2 days (A); A549 cells were treated with 2.5 µM BVD and 10 µM Ruxolitinib
  (Rux) separately or in combination for 2 days (B). Immunoblotting was conducted
  to determine pSTAT3-Y705. (C-E) Effects of JAK-STAT inhibition on ERKi-induced alteration
  of miR-204, SPDEF and SNAI2 expression. A549 and HCC827 cells were treated with
  2.5 µM BVD and 10 µM Rux, either singly or in combination, for 2 days, mRNA levels
  of miR-204 (C), SPDEF (D) and SNAI2 (E) were determined using qRT-PCR. (F-H) Effects
  of JAK-STAT inhibition on ERKi-induced EMT and CSC expansion. A549 cells were treated
  as in (c, d) for 5 days, the mRNA level of a panel of EMT markers were determined
  using qRT-PCR (F), the migration ability was determined using the wound healing
  assay (G), the sphere-forming capacity was determined using the semisolid sphere-formation
  assay (H). n = 3, bar: SD, **: P < 0.01. (I-L) Effects of JAK-STAT inhibition on
  tumor progression after ERKi treatment. A549 (I, J) and HCC827 (K, L) cells were
  injected into nude mice to generate subcutaneous xenografts. Mice were treated with
  BVD or Rux separately or in combination for 9 days. Tumor growth was continuously
  monitored for another 6 days. Tumor growth curves during treatment (I, K) and after
  treatment (J, L) were plotted. a: P < 0.001 vs. Vehicle group; b: P < 0.001 vs Rux
  group; c: P < 0.05 vs. BVD group; d: P < 0.001 vs Vehicle group; e: P < 0.001 vs
  BVD group; f: P < 0.05 vs. Rux group (Linear mixed effects models).'
