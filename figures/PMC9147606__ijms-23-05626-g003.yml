caption: The metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (may together with MMP-25) released after
  the production of NETs will interact with ECs, causing ECs to produce MMP-2. MMP-2
  and NE from NETs to attack the junction structures between ECs—VE-cadherin, E-cadherin
  and actin, resulting in damage to the physiological structure of ECs. Meanwhile,
  net-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation induces Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition
  (EndoMT) in ECs, which can be exacerbated by impaired VE-cadherin. In addition,
  neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were released by NETosis to destroy
  tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). By inhibiting the decomposition of TF, the
  expression level of TF was increased, and the endothelium was damaged by increasing
  blood viscosity. MPO derived from NETs directly destruct ECs by breaking NO, oxidants
  (HOCI, HOSCN, and NO2) production and non-catalytic pathway. Moreover, Cathepsin
  G cleaves the pro-IL-1α precursor into interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and further acts on
  TF.
