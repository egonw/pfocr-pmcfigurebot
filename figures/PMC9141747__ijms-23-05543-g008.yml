caption: Model of the regulatory pathway of YbdO-mediated signaling in E. coli K1.
  In the blood, the pH is neutral (7.4), and H-NS binds to the ybdO promoter and represses
  ybdO expression, thereby inhibiting activation of capsule gene expression. In the
  endosomes of HBMECs, the pH is acidic (5.5â€“6.5), which induces H-NS detachment from
  the promoter to activate ybdO expression, allowing subsequent activation of capsule
  gene expression by YbdO to promote capsule production.
