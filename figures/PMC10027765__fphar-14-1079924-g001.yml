caption: 'Proposed roles of TME in the mechanisms of ICI resistance. The immune response
  against lymphoma cells starts in the TME where neoantigens released by lymphoma
  cells are captured by antigen-presenting cells, followed by antigen presentation
  to T cells. Activated T cells kill lymphoma cells via IFN-γ signaling pathway. Inadequate
  activation and impaired function of effector T cells can be caused by insufficient
  neoantigen, aberrant HLA expression and defective IFN-γ signaling pathway. Moreover,
  the activation of effector T cells is inhibited by upregulation of other inhibitory
  checkpoint molecules, immunosuppressive metabolites and pro-tumorigenic cell populations
  in the TME. The major differences between lymphoma and solid cancer are highlighted:
  1) The main effector T cells are CD4+T cells instead of CD8+T cells in some subtypes
  of lymphoma, and resistance to ICIs can be induced by aberrant expression of HLA
  II. Moreover, the characteristics of neoantigens in lymphoma are distinct from solid
  tumor. (Showed with red characters with white background). 2) Tregs may be anti-tumorigenic
  in some lymphoma subtypes, possibly due to the direct suppression of lymphoma cells
  (showed with red dash line).'
