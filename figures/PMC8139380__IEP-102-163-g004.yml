caption: 'MiR19a regulated functions of lncRNA CASC2 through NFB signalling pathway
  A, RNA expression of NFB/p65 in NCM460, HT29 and SW480 cells were measured through
  RTqPCR, P<.05 compared with NCM 460 group. B, NFB/p65 RNA levels were evaluated
  in HT29 and SW480 cells after QNZ treatment (a NFB signalling pathway inhibitor),
  **P<.05 compared with NC group. C, Cell viabilities of HT29 and SW480 cells were
  examined by CCK8 after lncRNA CASC2 or miR19a upregulation and QNZ treatment, **P<.05
  compared with NC group, ^^P<.05 compared with oelncRNA CASC2 with NC mimics group
  and ##P<.05 compared with oelncRNA CASC2 with miR19a mimics group. D,E, Bcl2 and
  Bax RNA expressions were detected after QNZ treatment in HT29 cells and SW480 cells
  transfected with oelncRNA CASC2 and miR19a mimics, **P<.05 compared with oelncRNA
  CASC2 and miR19a mimics group. F, Protein expressions of LC3I, LC3II and p62 in
  HT29 and SW480 cells were measured by western blot after lncRNA CASC2 and miR19a
  upregulation and QNZ treatment, **P<.05 compared with oelncRNA CASC2 and miR19a
  mimics group'
