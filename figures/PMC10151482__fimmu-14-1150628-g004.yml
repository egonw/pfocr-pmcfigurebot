caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in each comparison group. (A) S4383-0-G
  vs R4345-0-G, (B) S4383-6-G vs R4345-6-G. The y-axis belongs to specific pathway,
  and the x-axis belongs to enrichment factor. The size and colors of the dots represent
  the number of genes and q values, respectively (The dots with larger-size indicated
  a higher number of genes in the pathway).
