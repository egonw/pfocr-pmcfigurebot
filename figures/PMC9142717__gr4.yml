caption: EC down-regulated Nrf2 pathway. L02 cells were subjected to different concentrations
  of EC treatment for 24 h. (A, C) Nrf2 and pNrf2 expressions were detected by Western
  Blot. (B) and (D) Quantitive analysis of (A) and (C). (E) Protein levels of Nrf2
  in nucleus and cytoplasm detected by Western Blot. (F) Quantitive analysis of (E).
  (G, I) HO-1 and NQO1 expressions detected by Western Blot. (H) and (J) Quantitive
  analysis of (G) and (I). *p < 0.05. EC, ethyl carbamate; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2 related factor 2; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; NQO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1.
article_title: Ethyl carbamate triggers ferroptosis in liver through inhibiting GSH
  synthesis and suppressing Nrf2 activation.
