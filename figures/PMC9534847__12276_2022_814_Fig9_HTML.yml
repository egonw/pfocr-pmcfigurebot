figure_title: Overview of procedures for metabolic flux analysis (MFA)
caption: 'MFA is performed as follows: a Selection of isotopic labeling experiments;
  b metabolic network model construction; c stable isotope tracer labeling experiments
  and measurement of isotopic labeling patterns of metabolites derived from the tracer
  substrate; d estimation of intracellular metabolic fluxes using statistical analysis;
  and assessment of flux values by using the goodness of fit and confidence intervals.
  e Results of metabolic flux rates of the pathway. RSS, residual sum of squares.'
