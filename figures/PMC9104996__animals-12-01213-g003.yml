caption: 'DLPC blocked progestogen receptor signaling pathway. (A) The effect of DLPC
  on 17 beta-estradiol (E2) production of granulosa cells. The concentration of oestradiol
  was detected by ELISA assay. (B) The effect of DLPC on progestogen (P4) production
  of granulosa cells. (C) The mRNA levels of progestogen receptor in granulosa cells
  by treatment with DLPC. (D) Immunofluorescence of progestogen receptor in granulosa
  cells by treatment with 50 μM DLPC or/and 10 μM P4. (E) Quantification of progestogen
  receptor was analyzed with Image J software. Bar: 200 μm. Data are expressed as
  the mean ± SEM from three independent replicates. Values with different letters
  (a, b, c) indicate significant differences in bars (p < 0.05). * p < 0.05, *** p
  < 0.001, comparing the indicated groups.'
