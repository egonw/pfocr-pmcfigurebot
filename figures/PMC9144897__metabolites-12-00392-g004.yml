caption: 'Metabolic alterations in ALA-treated tea tissue under cold stress. (A) PCA
  score plots for principal components 1 and 2 show high cohesion within groups and
  good separation among TALA-4h and CK groups. The sampling groups are color-coded
  as follows: green = TALA-4h; blue = CK; red = QC. (B) Heatmap visualization of relative
  levels of differential metabolites in the TALA-4h vs. CK comparison. The normalized
  value of peak areas of metabolites was used to represent the relative metabolite
  content and complete linkage hierarchical clustering. Each sample is visualized
  in a single column and each metabolite is represented by a single row. The up- and
  downregulated metabolites are shown in red and blue, respectively. (C) Enrichment
  of the differential metabolites from the TALA-4h vs. CK comparison with respect
  to distinct KEGG pathways. Differential metabolites were mapped to distinct metabolic
  pathways. Enrichment p-values were computed from a hypergeometric distribution.
  A p-value cutoff of 0.05 was selected as the threshold. The plot sizes represent
  the number of metabolites in each pathway term. (D) Relative levels of cold-related
  metabolites in ALA-treated tissues after cold stress challenge. The scale represents
  the normalized peak area values for each metabolite in the samples.'
