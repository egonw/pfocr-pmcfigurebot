caption: 'Diffusion tensor imaging of structural connectivity in the cortex and corpus
  callosum. (aâ€“c) White matter reconstructions (shown in sagittal view) of three main
  pathways involved in the processing of visual information: the superior longitudinal
  fasciculus (SLF; the neuroanatomical correlate of the dorsal visual processing stream),
  inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF; the ventral visual processing stream), and
  inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF; mediating visual attention and orienting).
  Diffusion data was acquired using high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging
  (HARDI) for improved delineation of crossing fibers. Pathway reconstructions are
  shown in a normal sighted control (a), an early ocular blind patient (b), and an
  individual with cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) and associated periventricular
  leukomalacia, who has significant visual dysfunction caused by injury to visual
  pathways and structures during early perinatal development (c). All pathways can
  be reconstructed in both the control and early ocular blind individuals. In contrast,
  in the individual with CVI, the SLF and ILF are sparser, and the IFOF cannot be
  reconstructed. These differences in structural integrity may be related to the observed
  cognitive visual dysfunctions in CVI. (d,e) fMRI-guided tractography shows connectional,
  topographic, and microstructural properties of the corpus callosum (CC). Tractographic
  segmentation (d) of seven callosal fibers based on cortical projections in one representative
  control participant (left) and one patient who suffered right hemianopia with macular
  sparing at age 8, following selective destruction of his left striate cortex as
  a result of traumatic brain injury (right). This arrangement of subdivisions is
  clearly discernible in the midsagittal cross-section of the CC (as shown) and highly
  coherent across patient and age-matched controls. Fibers are color-coded: red, orbitofrontal;
  orange, anterior frontal; yellow, superior frontal; green, superior parietal; blue,
  posterior parietal; purple, occipital; and cyan, temporal. Circular representation
  of the connectional fingerprint associated with functionally (e) defined cortical
  areas coactivated with callosal clusters of the CC using diffusion-weighted MRI
  and probabilistic tractography with fMRI. Segments represent different areas and
  ribbons represent fiber tracts, to clearly assess the relationship between structural
  and functional brain properties. Connections between areas in opposite hemispheres
  that did not course through the activated clusters in the CC are not displayed.
