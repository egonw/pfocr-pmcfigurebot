caption: 'Chemical formula of N1 and N2 and effects of these compounds on ORs in the
  G protein–mediated pathways. A, Molecular structures of the test compounds. B–G,
  Effect of each analgesic on MOR, DOR, and KOR activities in the G protein–mediated
  pathway. Cells expressing MOR (B), DOR (C), and KOR (D) were treated with morphine,
  fentanyl, N1, and N2 (10−11–10−5 M), and changes in impedance (ΔZiec) were measured
  using the CellKey system. Concentration-response curves were prepared by calculating
  ΔZiec relative to the data obtained for each positive control: 10−5 M DAMGO for
  MOR (B), 10−6 M SNC80 for DOR (C), and 10−5 M U-50488H for KOR (D). Cells expressing
  MOR (E), DOR (F), or KOR (G) were treated with various concentrations (10−11–10−5
  M) of each compound, and intracellular cAMP levels were measured using the GloSensor
  cAMP assay. Concentration-response curves were prepared by calculating cAMP levels
  relative to the data obtained with 10−5 M DAMGO for MOR (E), 10−5 M SNC80 for DOR
  (F), and 10−7 M U-50488H for KOR (G). In one experiment in this study, each drug
  was measured in duplicate (1 drug, 1 concentration/2 wells each) in a 96-well microplate.
  We analyzed with the average value of 2 wells set to n = 1. The data are presented
  as mean ± SEM for 3 independent experiments (n = 3). cAMP indicates cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; DAMGO, D-Ala(2)-N-Me-Phe(4)-Glyol(5)-enkephalin; DOR, δ-opioid receptor;
  KOR, κ-opioid receptor; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; N1, new opioid 1; N2, new opioid
  2; SEM, standard error of the mean; SNC80, (+)-4-[(aR)-a-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide;
  U-50488H, trans3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2(pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide;
  ΔZiec, impedance current.'
