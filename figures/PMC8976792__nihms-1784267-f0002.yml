figure_title: Induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cell lines
  with Type I PRMT inhibition
caption: 'A, Heatmap of genes in the IFNγ response pathway in the indicated tumor
  cell lines with/without Type I PRMTi treatment. Tumor cells were treated with 0.1%
  DMSO or 2 μM Type I PRMTi for 4 days. RNA-seq was used to determine gene expression.
  Log2-fold differential expression of genes was plotted. B, Human Panc08.13 pancreatic
  tumor cells were transfected with either pooled non-targeting control (NTC) or pooled
  STING-specific siRNAs (siSTING), and transfected cells were then treated with either
  0.1% DMSO or 2 μM Type I PRMTi for 6 days. Treatment with 24 hours of cGAS (G3-YSD,
  500 ng/mL) agonist was served as positive control. qRT-PCR was used to determine
  the expression of CXCL10 or ISG54 in treated tumor cells (N≥2). C-D, Type I PRMTi,
  PRR agonists, and interferon effects on CXCL10 and ISG54 expression in tumor cells.
  (C) Human A549 lung cancer cells and (D) mouse A20 lymphoma cells were treated with
  0.1% DMSO or 2 μM Type I PRMTi for 6 days with/without 24-hour exposure to PRR agonists
  or interferons. qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of CXCL10 and ISG54
  in treated tumor cells (N≥2). Open circles: predicted additive effect of the combination
  treatment. E-F, Heatmap of percentage of ISGs’ synergistic effects with Type I PRMTi
  and PRR agonists or interferons in a panel of (E) human and (F) mouse cell lines.
  Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or 2 μM Type I PRMTi for 6 days with/without 24-hour
  exposure to PRR agonists or interferons. The percentages of ISGs synergistic for
  the combination of Type I PRMTi with individual PRR agonist were calculated based
  on the expression of ISGs induced by the indicated treatment. All data are presented
  as mean±SEM. N indicates number of biological replicates for each group. Three technical
  replicates were performed for each biological replicate. P values were calculated
  by student’s 2-tailed t-test; *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001; ****p≤0.0001.'
