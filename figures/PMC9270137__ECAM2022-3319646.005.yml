caption: The y-axis is the negative logarithm of the statistic p-value; the x-axis
  is the pathway impact value. The larger the circle is, the greater the number of
  metabolite enrichments is and the more important the metabolic pathway is. The redder
  the color is, the more important the metabolic pathway is; the more yellowish, the
  less important. (a) The metabolic pathway of inflammatory bowel disease compared
  to healthy controls. (b) The metabolic pathway of damp-heat syndrome compared to
  spleen deficiency syndrome in inflammatory bowel disease.
