caption: Hesperetin supplementation alleviates inflammation caused by DWI in vivo
  or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro. (A) KEGG analysis showing
  that the effect of hesperetin is related to the NF-κB signaling pathway; (B) the
  ICAM-1 protein levels (red) in mouse aortic valves were detected by immunofluorescence
  staining, nuclear staining was performed with Hoechst (blue), and WGA (green) was
  used to show the morphology of the valve leaflet; scale bar = 50 μm; n = 5; (C)
  molecular structure of hesperetin; (D) cell viability after treatment with different
  concentrations of hesperetin for 24 h (0–50 μM), n = 5; (E) immunofluorescence staining
  was performed to confirm that hesperetin inhibits the LPS-induced cell nuclear translocation
  of P65 (green), nuclear staining was performed with DAPI (blue), and Vimentin (green)
  was used to show the morphology of the VICs; scale bar = 50 μm; n = 5; (F) VICs
  were pretreated with or without 3 μM hesperetin for 24 h and then stimulated with
  or without LPS for 24 h, and the protein expression levels of ICAM-1, MCP-1, and
  p-p65 were determined by Western blotting; n = 5; (G) the levels of IL-6 and RANTES
  were detected by using ELISA, n = 5; (H) under LPS stimulation for 3d, the levels
  of ALP and Runx2 were detected by immunoblotting; n = 3; (I) Alizarin Red S staining
  of human aortic VICs under 3 conditions (control, LPS, and LPS + Hst) for 4 weeks;
  scale bar = 500 μm; n = 5. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates
  p < 0.001, **** indicates p < 0.0001, and ns indicates p > 0.05.
