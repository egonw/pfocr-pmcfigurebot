caption: Primary mLECs isolated from C57BL/6 male or female mice revealed significantly
  reduced ROS level with increased expression of Bmal1 and Nrf2 and target antioxidants,
  Prdx6, Catalase and SOD1 in response to Metformin. Primary mLECs (5 × 104) isolated
  from C57BL/6 male and female mice were cultured in 12-well culture plate and treated
  with Metformin for 24 h as shown in figure. (A) Increased ROS levels during aging
  was mitigated by Metformin treatment. ROS levels were measured using H2-DCF-DA dye
  methods. The histograms represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments.
  Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. (B–F) Total RNA isolated
  from Metformin-treated primary mLECs-derived from C57BL/6 mice of both sexes was
  subjected for mRNA analysis of Bmal1 and Nrf2, and their target antioxidant gene,
  Prdx6, Catalase and SOD1 with their specific primers as shown in . The data represent
  the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
