caption: 'Sankey plots illustrating diagnostic pathways a) in the overall patient
  population (n=103), b) in the post hoc defined pre-riociguat approval subgroup (n=55)
  and c) in the post-riociguat approval (n=48) subgroup (post hoc analysis including
  the 21 patients whose post-PEA observation period overlapped with the period following
  riociguat approval in the USA). The thickness of the bars indicates higher level
  of use of a particular diagnostic pathway. Nodes describing the simultaneous occurrences
  of two or more assessments were collapsed into a single node. 6MWD: 6-min walk distance;
  CTA: computed tomography angiogram; Echo: echocardiogram; NT-proBNP: N-terminal
  prohormone of brain natriuretic protein; RHC: right heart catheterisation.'
