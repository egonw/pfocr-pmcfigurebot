caption: 'Inhibition of oral cancer cell migration by CCDC-PA is mediated via the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After cells treated with the AKT agonist SC78, the gene
  expression levels of Mmp-2, Mmp-9, Mmp-12 and Mmp-13 were analyzed in (A–D) HSC-3
  cells and (E–H) SCC4 cells in response to CCDC-PA (1:5 ratio) at 24h. The protein
  expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-12 and MMP-13 were analyzed in (I) HSC-3
  and (J) SCC4 cells in response to CCDC-PA at 24h. (K) The protein levels of AKT
  and phosphorylated forms were analyzed. (L) Cell migration assay of HSC-3 and SCC4
  cells were analyzed, and quantified. Control indicates a condition without treatment
  of CCDC-PA. 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration of PA
  in the CCDC system is equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively.
  The cropped images of blots shown in figures are used for illustrative purposes,
  full scan of the entire original gel(s) are included in the . Data are presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation. * and # indicate P<0.05.'
