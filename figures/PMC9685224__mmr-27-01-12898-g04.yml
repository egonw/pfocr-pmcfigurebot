caption: 'Expression levels of Hippo signaling pathway-associated downstream proteins
  following inhibition or activation of Akt expression. Expression levels of (A) Hippo
  pathway-associated proteins, and (B) Yap, p-YAP and CTGF were assessed by western
  blotting. Western blotting was performed to assess the expression levels of (C)
  Akt signaling pathway-associated proteins and (D) Hippo signaling pathway-associated
  proteins. Expression levels of Hippo pathway-associated proteins (E) Rassf1A, Mst1/2,
  Sav1, Mob1 and p-Mob1; and (F) Yap, p-YAP and CTGF following UA and DOX treatment
  were semi-quantified using ImageJ. Expression levels of (G) Akt signaling pathway-associated
  proteins p-Akt and Akt, Hippo signaling pathway-associated proteins Rassf1A, Mst1/2,
  Sav1, Mob1 and p-Mob1; and (H) Yap, p-YAP and Y CTGF following Akt activator and
  inhibitor, and UA and DOX treatment were semi-quantified using ImageJ. Values were
  normalized to GAPDH. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control, #P<0.05, ##P<0.01. vs. UA/DOX.
  CONT, control; UA, ursolic acid; DOX, doxorubicin; Yap, yes-associated protein 1;
  Mob1, MOB kinase activator 1; Mst, mammalian Ste20-like kinases; CTGF, connective
  tissue growth factor; Sav1, salvador family WW domain containing protein 1; Rassf1A,
  Ras association domain family member 1; p, phosphorylated; ns, not significant.'
article_title: Inhibition of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis by ursolic acid and doxorubicin
  is mediated by targeting the Akt signaling pathway and activating the Hippo signaling
  pathway.
