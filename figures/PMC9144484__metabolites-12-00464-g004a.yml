caption: Hierarchical tree representation of the reactome metabolic pathway categories
  of genes encoding (A) AFP14â€“20-like motif-containing proteins and (B) GIP-9-like
  motif-containing proteins. The tree summarizes the correlation among significant
  pathways in the gene enrichment list. Pathways with many shared genes are clustered
  together. Larger dots indicate more significant p-values.
