caption: (a) Effect of the methanol-soluble steam-exploded lignin fraction (SEL-F2)
  on tyrosinase (TYR), TYR-related protein 1 (TRP-1), and TYR-related protein 2 (TRP-2)
  protein expression levels in B16F10 melanoma cells. These cells were treated with
  25, 50, or 100 μg/mL SEL-F2 or arbutin prior to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
  (α-MSH) treatment for 24 h. The loading control was assessed using a β-actin antibody;
  (b) quantitative analysis of tyrosinase, (c) TRP-1, (d) TRP-2 by western blotting.
  Cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using antibodies against tyrosinase,
  TRP-1, and TRP-2. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
