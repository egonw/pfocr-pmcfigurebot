figure_title: Pathways of macrophages and neutrophils were decreased in Ad26.COV2.S
  vaccinated compared to sham unvaccinated hamsters
caption: (A) Sample-enrichment analysis (SLEA) of pathways of monocytes, macrophages
  M1 and M2 pathways, and neutrophils signaling at 4 dpi following SARS-CoV-2 challenge
  in vaccinated hamsters (shown in pink and blue colors), sham unvaccinated hamsters
  (shown in green) and in naïve control hamsters (shown in red). Heatmap presenting
  the SLEA z-score of each of these pathways. SLEA scores represent the mean expression
  of all significant genes within each pathway for each animal. An SLEA z-score greater
  than 0 corresponds to a pathway for which member genes are up-regulated, while an
  SLEA z-score inferior to 0 corresponds to a pathway with genes downregulated in
  that sample. Columns correspond to individual animals, and rows correspond to individual
  pathways scaled across all animals using the z-score R function. (B) Heatmaps of
  the normalized expression of the leading genes contributing to the enrichment of
  proinflammatory macrophages increased by SARS-CoV-2 in sham animals (in green) and
  decreased in Ad26 vaccinated hamsters (in pink and blue) at 4 dpi. (C) Correlation
  matrix plot showing the Spearman correlations of the SLEA z-score of monocytes,
  macrophages (M0, M1and M2), and neutrophils pathways at 4 dpi with viral loads in
  hamster’s lung and nares at 4 dpi, and with neutralizing and binding antibody titers
  at weeks 2–4 post-vaccination in vaccinated hamsters. Negative correlations were
  shown in cyan, and positive correlations were shown in pink. (D-K) Myeloid inflammation
  resolves by 14 days following challenge in vaccinated hamsters. Immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) was performed on lung specimens from WA1/2020 challenged Syrian hamsters for
  macrophages (Iba-1) and neutrophils (myeloperoxidase, MPO) at 4 (D, E left panels)
  and 14 days (D, E right panels) following challenge and cells per unit area were
  calculated using quantitative image analysis. (F-K) Representative images of Iba-1
  (IHC) from S.dTM.PP (F, I), S.PP (G, J), and sham (H, K) hamsters 4 days and 14
  days following challenge. Kruskall-Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple
  comparisons test. Red line = median.
