caption: Conceptual diagram. Hypothesis 1 is that inflammatory reactivity (IR) statistically
  mediates part of the relationship between distress (as indexed by the Hopkins Symptom
  Checklist) and pain (Brief Pain Inventory). Hypothesis 2 is that IR is positively
  associated with secondary hyperalgesia (SH). Note that, although the conceptual
  diagram indicates directional relationships, the cross-sectional nature of the data
  precludes causative conclusions. Grey colour indicates a relationship not directly
  tested in this study. Distress could increase IR via the HPA axis and/or the sympathetic
  nervous system. Distress is linked to a loss of glucocorticoid-mediated constraint
  of inflammation (usually maintained by the HPA axis), as well as sympathetically
  mediated release of pro-inflammatory monocytes from lymphoid tissues, and alterations
  in beta-adrenergic signalling that have a net pro-inflammatory effect, possibly
  via non-canonical signalling cascades (for review, see Walsh et al). Converging
  evidence supports a role of inflammation in human persistent pain, with the bulk
  of human studies showing activation of glial cells, including in locations that
  reflect the somatotopic distribution of pain (for review, see Grace et al). Glial
  cells are a significant (but not the only) source of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  placing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² and IL-6 as ideal indicators of
  pain-relevant and SH-relevant IR. Similarly, inflammatory processes potentiate SH,
  placing the heterotopic facilitation that SH represents as a potential mediator
  of the pathway between IR and pain, although only the association between IR and
  SH is a planned formal analysis for this study.
