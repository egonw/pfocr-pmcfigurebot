caption: 'C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-6 (CTRP6) overexpression attenuates
  ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the brain.(A–D)
  mRNA levels of inflammatory factors (A), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) protein level (B),
  tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) protein level (C), and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1) protein level (D) were measured to estimate inflammatory responses
  caused by 24-hour I/R (six animals per group). (E) Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  signaling pathway (six animals per group). (F) Protein expression levels of Bcl-2
  and Bax (six animals per group). (G, H) Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity (six animals
  per group). (I) TUNEL staining in the brain (six animals per group). Blue is positive
  signal as indicated in the I/R group. Scale bar: 100 μm. All data were normalized
  to the Sham group. The results are presented as the mean ± SEM, and were analyzed
  by one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey''s test. *P < 0.05, vs.
  Sham group; #P < 0.05, vs. I/R group. GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.'
