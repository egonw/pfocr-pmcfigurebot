caption: Glycolysis, PPP, and Lactate metabolism. Serum levels of (A) glucose, (B)
  glucose 6-phosphate, (C,D) PPP products, (E) pyruvate, and (F) lactate in PWH before
  and after ART compared with HIVSN. Scatter plots show mean and significance notations
  of adjusted p-values (95% CI) at * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, and
  **** = p < 0.0001. For multiple group comparisons, Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA
  tests were performed in combination with Games-Howell multiple comparisons correction
  for a sample size >50 with a 95% confidence interval. (G) Diagrammatic representation
  of metabolic pathways modified by HIV and ART. In pre-ART HIV blue text indicates
  pathway name, black text indicates no change, red text indicates significantly increased
  levels, and aqua text indicates significantly decreased levels compared with HIVSN.
  Solid line up-arrows (↑) indicate significantly increased and solid line down-arrows
  (↓) indicate significantly decreased levels following ART, compared with pre-ART
  HIV.
