caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DDT target for the treatment
  of ICH. (A) Hub genes of DDT for ICH. The top 35 key targets were screened by degree
  value using the CytoNCA plugin. (B) STRING analysis of the PPI network of DDT targets
  for treating ICH. Different colored spheres represent target genes, with protein
  structures inside. Lines indicate interactions between protein targets. The thicker
  lines represent the more considerable degree of the target node. (C) Statistical
  analysis of (B) The X-axis represented the name of the protein, and the Y-axis represented
  the number of network neighbor nodes.
