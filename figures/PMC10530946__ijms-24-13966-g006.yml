caption: Summary of the altered metabolic pathways resulting from the pathway analysis
  using MetaboAnalys 5.0. In the diagram of Pathway impact-log10(p) the colors represent
  the importance of the pathway. The light yellow represents the pathway that was
  less disrupted, and the red represent the pathway that was disrupted the most.
