caption: CCDC-PA inhibited the cell migration of HSC-3 and SCC4 cells treated with
  CCDC-PA at various stoichiometric ratios for 24 h. Wound healing assay of (A) HSC-3
  and (B) SCC4 cells. Images of wound closure were taken at the baseline (0 h) and
  8 h after wound generation. Representative photographs and quantitative data are
  graphically shown. Control indicates a condition without treatment of CCDC-PA. 1:20,
  1:10, 1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration of PA in the CCDC system
  is equivalent to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively. Data are expressed
  as mean ± S.D. (n = 3), with *P< 0.05 indicating the significant difference from
  the controls.
