caption: Effect of REA on ferroptosis in EC cells. (a) Transmission electron microscopy
  observation of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells (15000x, scale bar, 500 nm); (b) Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells-Prussian blue staining (400x, scale bar, 50 μm and 200 μm); (c)
  flow cytometric analysis of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells ROS; (d) ROS fluorescence intensity
  of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (e) Eca109 and KYSE150 cells GPX4 immunofluorescence
  staining (40x, Scale bar, 20 μm); (f) GPX4 expression in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells;
  (g) the content of MDA, SOD, GSH, and GPXS in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells. The data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared with the control group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P
  < 0.01.
