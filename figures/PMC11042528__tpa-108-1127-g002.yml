caption: The activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in the allograft-infiltrating macrophage
  is augmented, which is positively correlated with the M1 signature score and glycolysis
  signature score. A, Volcano plots showing DEGs identified by comparing the M1 subset
  with the M0 subset. Selected DEGs (with −log10P >1.3; log2 (fold change) > 1 or
  log2 (fold change) <−1) are highlighted in red or blue. B, Differential pathway
  enrichment analysis of DEGs identified between the M1 subset and the M0 subset.
  C, Correlation of MEK/ERK signature score with proinflammatory macrophages signatures
  score (left panel) or glycolysis signatures score (right panel). D, A flowchart
  depicts the process of murine heart transplant model construction and MEK/ERK signaling
  activation-level detection of AIMs in (E). E, Representative flow cytometry histogram
  (left panel) and quantitative plot (right panel) of the p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 expression
  level in cardiac graft-infiltrating macrophages. Each symbol represents 1 individual
  (n = 3 from 3 independent experiments, mean ± SD, 2-tailed unpaired Student t test).
  AIM, allograft-infiltrating macrophage; DEG, differentially expressed gene.
