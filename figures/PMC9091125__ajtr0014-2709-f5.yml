caption: 'Overexpression of TLR4 activated the NFκB signaling pathway and blocked
  the protective roles of SPI1 siRNA. (A) SPI1 and TLR4 protein levels and the NFκB
  phosphorylation in HL-1 cells after si-SPI1 and oe-TLR4 transfection and hypoxia
  exposure determined using western blot analysis; (B) Apoptosis of HL-1 cells examined
  by the TUNEL assay; (C) Secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in cells examined using ELISA
  kits; (D) Protein level of TLR4 and phosphorylation of NFκB in HL-1 cells after
  oe-TLR4 transfection and hypoxia exposure determined using western blot analysis;
  (E) Cell apoptosis examined by the TUNEL assay; (F) Secretion of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in cells examined using ELISA kits. For cellular experiments, repetition
  = 3. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Differences were analyzed by the unpaired
  t test (B and E) or two-way ANOVA (A, C, D, and F). *P < 0.05 vs. oe-NC; #P < 0.05
  vs. the si-SPI1 + oe-NC group; @P < 0.05 vs. oe-NC.'
