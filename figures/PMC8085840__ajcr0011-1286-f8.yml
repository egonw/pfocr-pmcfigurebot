caption: PNN activates CREB via PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling. A. The activity and
  protein levels of PI3K/AKT pathway in cells after altering PNN expression. PNN activates
  PI3K/AKT signaling. B. PNN regulates CREB activation through PI3K/AKT signaling.
  C. ERK partly involves in PNN phosphorylating and activating CREB. D, E. PNN activates
  CREB via PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling, and PI3K/AKT pathway play the major role.
  E. CREB activation is generated from pCREB/CREB normalized to negative control (pcDNA3.1-PNN
  (-), MK2206 (-) and FR180204 (-)).
