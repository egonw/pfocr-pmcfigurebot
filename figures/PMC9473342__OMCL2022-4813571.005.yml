caption: 'DSC2 suppressed the migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells through inhibiting
  the nuclear translocation of BRD4 and β-catenin, independently. After treating with
  ICG-001 (20 μM) and JQ1 (20 μM), the migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells that
  stably expressing DSC2 gene were detected by scratch wound-healing assay ((a) 60×),
  transwell migration assay ((b) 200×), and transwell invasion assay ((c) 200×). (d)
  After treating with JQ1, the expression of BRD4 and β-catenin in the nucleus of
  MGC-803 cells that transfected with sgRNA-DSC2 and sgRNA-NC were detected by Western
  blot assay. (e) After treating with ICG-001, the expression of BRD4 in the nucleus
  of MGC-803 cells that transfected with sgRNA-DSC2 and sgRNA-NC were detected by
  Western blot assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD from three separate experiments.
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. sgRNA-NC. ###p < 0.001 vs. Low-DSC2 group.'
