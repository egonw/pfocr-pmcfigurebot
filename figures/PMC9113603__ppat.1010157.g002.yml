figure_title: Characterization of milRNA biosynthetic pathway genes in F. oxysporum
  f. sp. cubense
caption: (A) Expression patterns of milRNA biosynthetic pathway genes at pure culture
  conditions (Cul) and 24 hours post inoculation (Ino-24h). Relative folds were calculated
  by 2-ΔΔCt method [], using transcription elongation factor 1 α gene (EF1α) as internal
  control. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 3). A Student’s t-test was used for significant
  analysis. **, p<0.01. (B) Conidial production of the tested strains. The tested
  strains were grown on PDA plates at 28°C for 7 days. Then same amounts of colony
  discs were washed by water supplemented with 0.05% tween 20 to prepare conidia suspension.
  And conidia were quantified under microscope using a haemocytometer. A Duncan’s
  multiple range test was used for significant analysis. Error bars indicate S. D.
  (n = 10). Different letters indicate significant difference at the level of α =
  0.01. (C) Colony morphology of the tested strains grown on PDA, minimal medium (MM),
  MM supplemented with 2 or 3 mM H2O2. The wild-type strain XJZ2, milRNA biosynthetic
  pathway gene knockout mutants (ΔFoQDE2, ΔFoDCL1, and ΔFoDCL2), and two FoQDE2 complementation
  transformants (cΔFoQDE2-1 and cΔFoQDE2-2) were inoculated on PDA and MM with 0,
  2, or 3 mM H2O2 and were cultured at 28°C. Colony morphology and mycelial growth
  were recorded after 3 days of culture.
