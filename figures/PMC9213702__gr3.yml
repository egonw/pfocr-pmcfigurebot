caption: The presence of the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism in reaction analysis
  and the individual models(A) A pathway showing four of the reactions upregulated
  in the three diseases. Red arrows indicate reactions from the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
  metabolism, purple arrows indicate reactions from the Butanoate metabolism. On the
  right, the bar-plot shows the enrichment of these four reactions in each disease.(B)
  Reaction presence in the models. Reactions were only considered if they were significant
  (Benjamini-Hochberg, Q < 0.01) in every disease and there was over 20% difference
  in the abundance between the presence of the increased MSPs and decreased MSPs.
  Red shows the reaction is present in the model, blank white shows the reaction is
  absent.
