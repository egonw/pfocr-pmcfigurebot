caption: Expression of Cx32 mRNA is decreased in HCC cell populations with higher
  stem cell characteristics. (A and B) Cx32 mRNA in CD133+, EpCAM+ liver CSCs and
  CD133-, EpCAM-non-liver CSCs sorted from primary HCC cells was analyzed by qPCR.
  *P<0.05 vs. the CD133- or EpCAM- group. (C) Cx32 mRNA in HCC spheres and attached
  cells obtained from primary HCC cells was detected by qPCR, *P<0.05 vs. the attached
  cells. (D and E) Expression level of Cx32 in CD133+, EpCAM+ liver CSCs and CD133-,
  EpCA- non-liver CSCs sorted from spheres of HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells was analyzed
  by qPCR. *P<0.05 vs. the CD133- or EpCAM- group. (F) Cx32 mRNA levels were detected
  in spheres of HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells and corresponding adherent cells. *P<0.05 vs.
  the attached cells. Cx32, connexin 32; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; EpCAM, epithelial
  cell adhesion molecule; CSCs, cancer stem cells; qPCR, quantitative PCR.
