caption: Enzyme expression level in individual cytoplasms and relationship of cellv
  0 to cell volume. (A) Compartment markers NASP (Nuclear Autoantigenic Sperm Protein,
  nucleus) and EEF2.1 (Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 2.1, cytoplasm) have
  the expected expression level in the cytoplasm. Six oocytes (late stage V) were
  dissected to obtain near‐native nuclei and cytoplasms. The low‐speed supernatants
  of individual cytoplasms (cyto S7500) were then analyzed by LC‐MS to obtain their
  proteomes. Protein abundance was estimated by spectral counting (% of total ∑# PSMs)
  and ranked according to these estimates (%rank). (B) Relative expression of GAPDH
  and MDH1 in isolated cytoplasms (GAPDH, red dots; MDH1 blue dots). Fluctuation of
  GAPDH abundance is matched by fluctuation of MDH1 abundance. TKTL2, a pentose phosphate
  pathway enzyme, does not co‐vary with either GAPDH or MDH1. For example, TKTL2 expression
  is lower than GAPDH and MDH1 in cytoplasm 1, but higher than both in cytoplasm 3.
  The expression level of translation factor EEF2.1 is remarkably similar in the cytoplasms
  analyzed. (C) Relationship between the abundance of GAPDH and MDH1 (% of total ∑#
  PSMs) in isolated cytoplasms. (D) Relationship between cellv 0 and cell volume for
  18 stage VI oocytes (animal 3). Each dot is an individual cell. Equations for the
  lines of best fit in 3C and D are presented in Table A,B.
