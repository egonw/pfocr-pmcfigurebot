figure_title: Metabolic reprogramming orchestrates primary tumor cell invasion and
  supports PMN priming via exosomes
caption: 'Successful invasion is strongly dependent on proteolytic degradation of
  ECM, and vascularization. Metabolic reprogramming allows primary tumor cells to
  invade surrounding tissue, particularly through increased production of lactate
  from boosted glycolysis resulting in acidification of tumor microenvironment (TME).
  The acidification of TME contributes to: i. the rearrangement of the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) via expression of MMPs; ii. the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion by Src-triggered
  reduction of E-cadherin expression; iii. the anchorage-independent growth via increased
  production of ATP and NADPH fueled by the overexpression of PRODH and IDH1 respectively;
  and iv. the angiogenesis through the production of oncometabolites that induce expression
  of VEGF and IL-8 by cancer cells. Primary tumors have also the innate capacity to
  educate the pre-metastatic niche (PMN) by shedding exosomes. Exosomes that carry
  PKM2 enhance the ability of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) to engage glucose-derived
  biosynthetic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Exosomes packed
  with miR-155, miR-210, LMP1, or TGF-β induce activation of normal fibroblasts to
  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), a process accompanied by autophagy and glycolysis
  as well as induction of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) and lactate, which can be consumed
  by cancer cells. In addition, lactate induces PMN acidification and decreased expression
  of TNF-α and IL-2 resulting in an escape from immune surveillance. This acidification
  of the PMN also induces overexpression of IL-8, MMP9, and VEGF by cancer cells and
  TAMs leading to angiogenesis.'
