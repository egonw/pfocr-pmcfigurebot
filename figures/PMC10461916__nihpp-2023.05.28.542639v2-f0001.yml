figure_title: Constructing a biochemistry-to-growth model for DHFR and TYMS
caption: a) Schematic describing the relationship between metabolic pathway flux and
  enzyme velocity. Many enzymes show a hyperbolic relationship between velocity and
  flux; the enzyme control coefficient describes the fractional change in flux given
  a fractional change in velocity. Control coefficients vary with the starting enzyme
  velocity (purple and dark blue arrows, background “A”) and can change with genetic
  background (violet and light blue arrows, background “B”). Consequently mutations
  can have a strong effect on flux and growth in one context but not in another (compare
  violet and purple arrows).b) The role of DHFR and TYMS in folate metabolism. Metabolites
  are labeled in grey or black italic text. Dotted lines indicate multiple intermediate
  reactions that are summarized with a single line.c) The relationship between the
  experimentally measured relative abundance of [10-formyl-THF] and E. coli growth
  rate. Red points indicate five DHFR variants in the background of TYMS R166Q (a
  near catalytically inactive variant) and black indicates the same DHFR variants
  in the context of WT TYMS. Error bars indicate the standard deviation across N=3
  replicates for both growth rate (y-axis) and 10-formyl-THF abundance (x-axis). The
  blue dotted line indicates the best fit for a hyperbolic model () relating THF abundance
  to growth.d) A simplified, abstracted version of the DHFR and TYMS system. Again
  dotted lines indicate multiple intermediate reactions that are summarized with a
  single line.e) The correlation between experimentally measured log10[10-formyl-THF]
  relative abundance and the model prediction (as computed with ). The grey dotted
  line indicates x=y. Color coding is identical to c. Error bars in x indicate the
  standard deviation across N=3 replicate experimental measurements, error bars in
  y describe the standard deviation across ten fits obtained by jackknife (leave-one-out)
  sub-sampling the data and refitting the model.f) The correlation between experimentally
  measured and predicted growth rates for five DHFR point mutations in two different
  TYMS backgrounds (same mutants as in c,e). The grey dotted line indicates x=y. Color
  coding is identical to c. Error bars in x indicate the standard deviation across
  N=3 replicate experimental measurements, error bars in y describe the standard deviation
  across ten fits obtained by jackknife (leave-one-out) sub-sampling the data and
  refitting the model.
