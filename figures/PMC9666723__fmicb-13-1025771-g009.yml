caption: Distribution of DEGs on iPath integration metabolic pathway in paired comparison
  of Gm-Ba-Ss vs. Gm. The red line represents the pathway affected by up-regulated
  genes, the blue line represents the pathway affected by down-regulated genes, and
  the yellow line represents the pathway affected by both up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes.
