caption: Interactome analysis of exosomal proteins isolated from exosomes secreted
  within 3D fibroblast culture media. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis generated interactome
  of significantly modulated exosomal proteins detected from 3D fibroblast cultures.
  Protein expression profiles predict the activation of functions associated with
  extracellular matrix, such as quantity, formation, attachment, accumulation and
  remodelling. The cytokine IL-6, which seems to be central to the signalling pathways,
  has been highlighted.
