caption: Doc induced formation of the polyploid NSCLC cells. (a) Experimental design.
  The NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299 were treated with 1/0.5 μM Doc for 24 hours
  to induce mitotic failure and then cultured in a drug-free medium for 3 days. Human
  umbilical cord-derived MCSs, MSC-CM, MSC-exosomes, and the polyploid A549 or H1299
  cells were cultured together for 48 hours or 72 hours in indirect co-culture using
  the transwell system. (b) Morphologic change in A549 and H1299 cells by conventional
  light microscopy after treatment with1/0.5 μM Doc for 24 hours and then cultured
  in a drug-free medium for 3 days (×200). (c) The morphology of the polyploid A549
  and H1299 cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy; blue represented DAPI-labeled
  nucleus (×200). (d, e) DNA content of the polyploid A549 and H1299 cells was analyzed
  by flow cytometry.
