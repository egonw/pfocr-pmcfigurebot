caption: The expression of HOXC10 was positively correlated with ABCC3 and β-catenin.
  A. Pathway enrichment analysis using GEO dataset and GSEA software. B. qRT-PCR assay
  was performed to analyze the expression of ABC transporters after up- and down-regulating
  HOXC10. C. TOP/FOP activity of 293T cells after regulating HOXC10 expression. D,
  F. qRT-PCR and western blot assay were performed to analyze the β-catenin expression
  after regulating HOXC10. E. qRT-PCR assay was to analyze the expression of the target
  genes of WNT signaling pathway after the regulation of HOXC10. G. IHC staining to
  analyze the expression of HOXC10, ABCC3 and β-catenin in the OC tissues. ns P >
  0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
