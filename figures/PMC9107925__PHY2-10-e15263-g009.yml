caption: Glucagon concentrations required to stimulate glucose mobilization compared
  to those required to activate the PLC/IP3 and AC/cAMP pathways. The shaded vertical
  bar is the statistical range of mean glucagon concentrations, determined by RIA,
  in the hepatic portal system of humans, rats, dogs, and pigs, 27.8–60.0 (101.44–101.78)
  pM, with a mean (dotted line) of 43.9 pM (101.64) pM (see Figure ). The glucose
  mobilization curve (glucose output, glycogenolysis, or gluconeogenesis) is a composite
  of 11 dose‐response curves published between 1971 and 1999 (Bizeau and Hazel (),
  Cárdenas‐Tanús et al. (), Chan et al. (), Corvera and García‐Sáinz (), Exton, Lewis,
  et al. (), Felíu et al. (), Fleig et al. (), Hermsdorf et al. (), Ikezawa et al.
  (), Khan et al. () and Wernette Hammond and Lardy ()), determined in rat hepatocytes
  or isolated perfused rat livers. The composite AC/cAMP curve is the average of 15
  individual curves generated in rat hepatocytes, liver membranes, or cell lysates
  (Clark and Jarrett (), Corvera and García‐Sáinz (), Dich and Gluud (), Dighe et
  al. (), England et al. (), Exton, Robison, et al. (), Hermsdorf et al. (), Lynch
  et al. (), Pohl et al. (), Robberecht et al. (), Rodbell et al. (), Soman and Felig
  (), Sonne et al. (), Unson et al. () and Yagami ()). The inositol‐phosphate data
  are from Wakelam et al. () (filled triangles) and Unson et al. () (open triangles).
  The bar below the X axis indicates the four concentration zones as depicted in Figure
  . Glucagon clearly activates the PLC/IP3 pathway in zones 1–4. However, in vivo
  it does not activate AC in zone 1, inconsistently activates it in zone 2 (see text),
  and predictably activates AC in zones 3 and 4. The TC for activating AC ex vivo,100 pM,
  is 2.5 times greater than the aggregate mean hepatic portal plasma concentration
  of 44 pM, and 100‐fold greater than the 10 pM TC for increasing glucose mobilization.
  The data clearly show that a substantial fraction of the maximum stimulation of
  hepatic glucose mobilization, around 40%, is produced by glucagon at physiological
  (zone 1) concentrations and mediated exclusively by the PLC/IP3 pathway. An additional
  35%, generated by supraphysiological, zone 3 concentrations, is mediated by maximal
  activation of the PLC/IP3 pathway together with a submaximal activation AC/cAMP
  pathway. The resulting boost in glucose output within zone 3 may be an adaptive
  response to elevated systemic glucose demand in vivo (see text)
