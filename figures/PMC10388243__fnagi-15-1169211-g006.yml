caption: The effect of PRDX6 overexpression on EGFR and MAPKs in ARPE-19 cells. (A)
  Cells were infected with lentivirus containing the PRDX6 plasmid. Total EGFR, P38MAPK,
  ERK, JNK, and β-actin were detected by western blot. (B) Quantitative analysis of
  western blot results, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared to control. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining of EGFR, PRDX6, and DAPI after ARPE-19 cells were infected with lentivirus
  containing a control plasmid or the pLV-Flag PRDX6 plasmid. Scale bar = 20 μm. (D)
  Cells were infected with lentivirus containing a control plasmid or the pLV-Flag
  PRDX6 plasmid for 48 h and were treated with 300 and 500 μM H2O2 for 6 h. EGFR,
  P38MAPK, ERK, JNK, and β-actin were detected by western blot. (E) Quantitative analysis
  of western blot results is shown in panel (D). All data were from three independent
  experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
