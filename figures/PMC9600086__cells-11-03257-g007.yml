caption: (a) The regulation of the β3-adrenoreceptor (AR)-cGMP pathway by PDEs throughout
  the aging of hiPSC-CMs in culture from day 30 to day 90. Model traces of cGMP production
  after the inhibition of β1- and β2-AR and situation of β3 via isoproterenol (ISO)
  and subsequent (b) PDE1 inhibition via vinpocetine (VIMPO), (c) PDE2 inhibition
  via EHNA, (d) PDE3 inhibition via Cilostamine (CILO), (e) PDE5 inhibition via Sildenafil,
  and (f) PDE9 inhibition via PF-04447943 (PF-), and saturation via 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
  (IBMX). All data is composed of three independent experimental batches. * p < 0.1;
  **** p < 0.0001.
