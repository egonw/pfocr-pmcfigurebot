figure_title: Early functional alterations in the AppNL-G-F mice
caption: 'a,b,c,d Whole-cell current clamp recordings of intrinsic properties from
  CA1 pyramidal neurons from Wt and AppNL-G-F at different months (MO). (a) Intrinsic
  excitability, firing rate in function of somatic current injection, (b) resting
  membrane potential, (c) Tau membrane constant and (d) input resistance. Number of
  neurons from 3 or more mice, 3MO - Wt n = 14, AppNL-G-F n = 20; 4MO - Wt n = 11,
  AppNL-G-F n = 12, 6MO - Wt n = 11, AppNL-G-F n = 17. Two-tailed unpaired t-test.
  (*p < 0.05). (a) Two-way ANOVA, with Holm-Sidak post-hoc multiple comparisons test
  (190 pA p = 0.0157, 210 pA p = 0.0098, 230 pA p = 0.0018, 250 and 270 pA p = 0.0008,
  290 pA p = 0.0171, 310 pA p = 0.0212, 330 pA p = 0.0303)). (b,c,d) Two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. Individual data points shown with bars representing mean ± SEM. (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). e, Images of Wt (left) and AppNL-G-F (right) acute hippocampal
  slices on the multielectrode array (MEA2100, Multichannel Systems) used for field
  excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings. Stimulation and recording
  electrodes are indicated with purple and yellow circles, respectively. f, Example
  traces of fEPSP responses in Wt and AppNL-G-F before (dark traces) and 55 minutes
  after minimal LTP induction (light traces). g, LTP induced in CA1 region by Schaffer
  collateral (SC) pathway stimulation using 3 theta burst stimulations. h, LTP induced
  in CA1 region using minimized theta burst stimulation paradigm (65.05 min p = 0.048,
  81.55 min p = 0.049, 92.55 min p = 0.0366). i, Input-output (IO) relationship for
  Wt and AppNL-G-F slices. j, Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) stimulations of SC pathway.
  Stimulation intensities used for LTP and paired pulse ratio recordings were calculated
  from CA1 region using SC stimulation in Wt and AppNL-G-F slices (inter stimulus
  intervals (ISI): 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 ms). Number of mice: Normal LTP –Wt n = 5,
  AppNL-G-F n = 5; Minimal LTP - Wt n = 4, AppNL-G-F n = 4. Two-way ANOVA, with Holm-Sidak
  post-hoc multiple comparisons test. Individual data points shown with bars representing
  mean ± SEM. (*p < 0.05).'
