caption: 'EPICERTIN: A KDELR ligand and a modulator of the unfolded protein response
  that promotes cell survival and proliferation. (A) Structural models of CTB and
  EPICERTIN (EPT) monomers generated by the Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine
  V 2.0 (Phyre2) software created by the Structural Bioinformatics Group, Imperial
  college, London and updated on January 25, 2021 [] based on a crystal structure
  of CTB (Protein Data Bank ID: 3CHB). The C-terminal KDEL amino acid sequence extension
  of EPT is highlighted in red at the top of the image. (B) A proposed model of EPICERTIN-KDELR
  signaling and modulation of the UPR. 1. Both CTB and EPT bind to GM1 at the plasma
  membrane, but with differing outcomes. EPT may also bind to KDELR on the plasma
  membrane. 2. CTB and EPT are endocytosed in early endosomes, and eventually, the
  pentamer disintegrates into monomers within late endosomes. 3. EPT and CTB are retrogradely
  transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and finally to the ER, following a
  lipid-based sorting pathway. Only EPT interacts with and activates KDELR signaling,
  promoting vesicular transport and the recycling of ER chaperones. Activation of
  KDELR by EPT may also occur early on the endosome membrane and in the TGN. 4. In
  the ER, both CTB and EPT may displace chaperones from ER stress sensors (PERK, ATF6α,
  IRE1α/β) and induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), although only EPT is known
  to activate IRE-XBP1s. 5. Activation of the ER stress sensors leads to the generation
  of the transcription factors phosphorylated eIF2α, ATF6αp50, and XBP1s, which transactivate
  genes in the nucleus that are associated with ER homeostasis. The increased endocytosis
  of CTB may trigger apoptosis by various mechanisms, including a chronic UPR or activation
  of death receptors []. In contrast, EPT–KDELR–chaperone complexes are allowed to
  recycle between ER and TGN, alleviating the ER stress by replenishing chaperones
  back into the ER, modulating the intensity and amplitude of UPR. Alternatively,
  the surplus of endocytosed CTB eventually overwhelms the endosome-to-TGN trafficking,
  which is known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome to induce apoptosis []. EPT–KDELR
  interaction might activate signaling pathways regulating and improving vesicular
  trafficking and cell survival which are currently unknown; however, preliminary
  data suggest the involvement of MAPK kinases (unpublished observations). C: Cytoplasm;
