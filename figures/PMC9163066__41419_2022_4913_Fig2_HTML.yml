figure_title: circSCAF8 is upregulated in PCa tissues and urine extracellular vesicles
caption: A, B The expression profile of circSCAF8 in urine extracellular vesicles
  (A) and tissues (B) from patients with PCa (n = 30) and those with benign prostatic
  hyperplasia (n = 30). C, D The circSCAF8 expression levels (stratified by grade
  and stage) in PCa tissues from a cohort (n = 85) who underwent radical prostatectomy.
  E Kaplan–Meier curves of progression-free survival according to the circSCAF8 expression
  level in PCa tissues (n = 85). F Cox regression analysis of the circSCAF8 expression
  level with progression-free survival. G, H Representative images and quantitative
  analyses for the circSCAF8 expression in PCa/benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue
  via FISH. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. PCa prostate cancer, FISH fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, GG grade group.
