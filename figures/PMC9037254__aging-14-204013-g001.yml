caption: Immunohistochemical expression of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in gastric
  cancer (GC) and para-carcinoma tissues. (A) Slides without primary antibody served
  as the negative control in GC tissues. (B) Typical immunohistologic features with
  Nrf2 expression in GC tissues. The Nrf2 staining localized predominantly in the
  nucleus. (C) Typical immunohistologic features with HO-1 expression in GC tissues.
  (D) Typical immunohistologic features with Nrf2 expression in para-carcinoma tissues.
  Magnifications, Ã—200.
