caption: No strong association was observed between immunogenicity and Apical Junction
  Pathway score. A. With TCGA cohort, there were no consistent data to suggest strong
  immunity in the high Apical Junction Pathway score group. Silent and non-silent
  mutation rates as well as CNA are higher in the low Apical Junction Pathway score
  group, while neoantigens, intratumor heterogeneity, and homologous recombineation
  defects were not different between groups. B. xCell algorithm was used to exam immune
  cell composition in the TME of both high and low Apical Junction Pathway score groups.
  There were no consistent data in the immune cell composition based on the Apical
  Junction Pathway score; while some anti-cancer immune cells such as CD4 memory T
  cell, Helper T cell 1, and NK cells were high in the low score group in all three
  cohorts, CD8 T cells and M1 macrophages were rather higher in the high score group
  in only one cohort (GSE84437). TCGA, the cancer genome atlas; CNA, copy number alterations;
  TME, tumor microenvironment; NK, natural killer.
