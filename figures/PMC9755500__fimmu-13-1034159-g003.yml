caption: Immune, stress and antiviral Response during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A)
  G SEA at the single cell resolution across the three groups (COVID-19 patients,
  healthy and recovered), the row dendrograms distinguish the immune and stress response
  pathways. The cell types and the groups were highlighted using different color bars.
  Data is expressed as a relative enrichment score for each pathway. (B, C) Expression
  of (B) ADAM, and (C) APOBEC3 genes. (D) Expression of antiviral genes in the COVID-19
  patients and correlation with HRCT score. (E) Expression of IFN family genes across
  all the cell types across the three groups. Cell types and groups were highlighted
  using different color bars. (F) Cumulative expression of type I and type II IFN
  receptors between the Classical monocyte and CD4+ TCM across the three groups.
