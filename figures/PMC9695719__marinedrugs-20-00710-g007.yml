caption: Effects of SC on the NF-κB signaling pathway in HT22 cells with HO-1 inhibited.
  Cells were treated with 5 μM ZnPP for 1 h with SC (14.73 µM) followed by 5 mM glutamate
  for 1 h. Subsequently, phosphorylation levels of IκBα (A,B) cytoplasmic NF-κB p65
  (A,C), and nuclear NF-κB p65 (A,D) involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway were
  detected by Western blot assay. Values are expressed as the mean ± SE calculated
  from three replicates. The statistical symbols (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; n.s.,
  no significance) indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated group.
