caption: The mechanistic approach of polydatin (PD) activity in terminating cell cycle
  in cervical cancer cells. PD causes the downregulation of the c-Myc gene, which
  alters two mechanisms involved in cervical cancer. PD causes upregulation of p21
  and p27, and also induces repression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 as well as CDK2 and cyclin
  E1; their dysregulation ultimately terminates the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.
  In the second pathway, PD causes Snail and Slug expressions, leading to upregulation
  of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of N-cadherin, and thus impairing cell
  metastasis in cervical cancer.
