caption: Metabolic phenotypes of Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f mice on a normal chow diet (NCD).
  (a) Strategy for generating Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (mice with Tcf7l2 liver-specific KO).
  (b) Representative western blot showing TCF7L2 expression in the peripheral tissues
  of 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=3) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=3) mice. Quantification
  of TCF7L2 protein levels is also shown. eWAT, epididymal white adipose tissue; WT,
  wild-type. (c–e) 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=9) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=6) mice fed
  an NCD were assessed for body weight (c), blood glucose levels (d) and plasma insulin
  levels (e). (f) GTT (1.5 g/kg body weight) in 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=9) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f
  (n=6) mice fed an NCD, with glucose AUC is presented. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f
  vs wild-type mice at the same time point, analysed by unpaired Student’s t test.
  (g) Plasma insulin concentration during GTT in 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=9) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f
  (n=6) mice fed an NCD, with insulin AUC presented. (h) ITT (1 U/kg body weight)
  in 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=9) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=6) mice fed an NCD, with
  glucose AUC is presented. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f vs wild-type
  mice at the same time point, analysed by unpaired Student’s t test. (i) Ten-week-old
  Tcf7l2f/f (n=12) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=12) mice were fasted for 6 h and then
  injected intraperitoneally with insulin (10 U/kg body weight) or saline for 10 min.
  Representative western blot showing the effects of hepatic Tcf7l2 depletion on the
  hepatic insulin signalling pathway. The p-Akt/Akt and phosphorylated glycogen synthase
  kinase-3 β (p-GSK3β/GSK3β ratios are presented. (j) RER in 10-week-old Tcf7l2f/f
  (n=12) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=11) mice fed an NCD. RER was measured hourly in
  each metabolic chamber using the Oxylet Pro system. Average RER values for light
  (09:00–21:00 hours) and dark (21:00–09:00 hours) phases in a 12 h/12 h light/dark
  cycle are presented. (k, l) Ten-week-old Tcf7l2f/f (n=6) and Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f (n=5)
  mice were fasted for 6 h, after which hepatic TG levels (k) and gene expression
  (l) were analysed. (l) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showing mRNA expression
  of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver of mice. The key in (b) also
  applies to (c–i) (k) and (l). Data in (b), (i) and (l) are presented as mean±SD;
  data in (c–h) (j) and (k) are presented as mean±SEM. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  analysed by t test
