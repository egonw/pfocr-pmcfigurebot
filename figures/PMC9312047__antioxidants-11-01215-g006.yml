caption: Changes in the PPAR signaling pathway and lipid metabolism-related genes
  in the liver of M. salmoides between the low-density group (LL) and the high-density
  group (HL). (A) DEGs in the KEGG PPAR signaling pathway and possible mechanisms
  regulating lipid metabolism. (B) Lipid metabolism-related gene expression measured
  by qPCR; values are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 3), * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
  (C) The correlation between the qPCR data and RNA-seq data.

  Parameters, Redox Status and Lipid Metabolism of Micropterus salmoides in Integrated
  Rice–Fish Farming Systems.
