caption: 'The non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Under physiological conditions,
  the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is inactivated because of the low levels
  of NIK protein, which is due to TRAF2-, TRAF3-, and cIAP1/2- mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation. Under stress or pathological conditions, elevated cytokines such
  as BAFF, CD40L, CD30L, LTα/β/LIGHT, OX40L, RANKL, and TWEAK bind to their receptors
  BAFFR, CD40, CD30, LTβR, OX40, RANK, and Fn14, respectively, which recruit TRAF2,
  TRAF3, and cIAP1/2, causing their ubiquitination and degradation. NIK protein levels
  are increased, and NIK phosphorylates IKKα and NF-κB2, leading to p100- to p52-
  processing. p52 and RELB form heterodimers and enter the nucleus to perform their
  function by activating gene transcription. BAFF: B-cell-activating factor; CD40L:
  CD40 ligand; CD30L: CD30 ligand; LTα/β: lymphotoxin alpha/beta; OX40L: OX40 ligand;
  RANKL: receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; TWEAK: tumor necrosis factor-like weak
  inducer of apoptosis; BAFFR: B-cell-activating factor receptor; LTβR: lymphotoxin
  beta receptor; RANK: receptor activator of NF-κB; Fn14: FGF-inducible 14; TRAF2:
  TNF-receptor associated factor 2; TRAF3: TNF-receptor associated factor 3;cIAP1/2:
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; Ub: ubiquitin; NIK: NF-κB-inducing kinase;
  IKKα: inhibitory kappa B kinase alpha.'
