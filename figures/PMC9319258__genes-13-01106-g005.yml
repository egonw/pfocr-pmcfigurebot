caption: Protein−protein interaction (PPI) network. PPI network has been generated
  by STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) based on
  the targeted proteins involved in (A) the adherens junction; (B) the ECM-receptor
  interaction pathway; (C) the TGFβ; and (D) the cell cycle pathway. Nodes are proteins.
  The thickness of the line is proportional to the strength of the interaction between
  2 proteins.
