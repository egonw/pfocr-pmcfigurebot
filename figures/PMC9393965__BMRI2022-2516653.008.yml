caption: Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the optimal
  genes based on three feature ranking algorithms. The FDR < 0.05 criterion was used
  to filter GO terms and KEGG pathways. (a) The top 5 GO enrichment results based
  on mRMR. (b) The top 5 KEGG pathway enrichment results based on mRMR. (c) The top
  5 GO enrichment results based on MCFS. (d) The top 5 KEGG pathway enrichment results
  based on MCFS. (e) The top 5 GO enrichment results based on SHAP by LightGBM. (f)
  The top 5 KEGG pathway enrichment results based on SHAP by LightGBM.
