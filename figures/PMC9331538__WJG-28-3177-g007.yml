caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide attenuates the cytotoxicity of CPT11,
  oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin through the Met signaling pathway. A-C: HCT116 cells
  were pre-incubated with SU11274, a specific Met inhibitor, and then treated with
  PTHrP (10-8 M) and/or irinotecan (CPT-11, 10 μM) (A), oxaliplatin (OXA, 10 μM) (B),
  or doxorubicin (DOXO, 5 μM) (C) for 24 h. The number of viable cells was quantified
  by Trypan blue technique. In each experiment, a control with DOXO, the vehicle of
  the inhibitor, was performed. Graph bars represent the average of the results obtained
  from two independent experiments. CPT-11: Irinotecan; DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide; DOXO:
  Doxorubicin; OXA: Oxaliplatin; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide; SU: SU11274.
  aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001.'
