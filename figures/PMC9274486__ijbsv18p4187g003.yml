caption: Rheb is a common directly target of miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p. (A) TargetScan,
  miRanda, PITA and miRWalk were used to predict direct target genes of miR-199a-3p
  and miR-199a-5p. (B) Combined with mToR signaling pathway gene, screening out the
  target gene of Rheb. (C) The expression levels of Rheb in human NSCLC cell lines.
  BEAS-2B cells were used for the normal control comparison. (D) The relative expression
  of Rheb mRNA from 74 primary NSCLC clinical tissue samples and their non-tumor tissues
  as measured by qRT-PCR. (E and F) There was a negative correlation between miR-199a-3p/5p
  and Rheb, according to the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. (G) Performed by immunohistochemistry,
  the relative expression of Rheb from NSCLC clinical tissue samples and its non-tumor
  tissues. (H) The effect of Rheb expression levels on the overall survival of 1926
  lung cancer patients was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using a Kaplan-Meier
  Plotter. (I) Expression level of Rheb in LUAD and LUSC tissues through GEPIA analysising.
  (J) Rheb WT 3'-UTR contains predicted miR-199a-3p/5p binding site. The data shows
  alignment of miR-199a-3p/5p with Rheb WT 3'-UTR and arrows indicate mutagenesis
  nucleotides. (K) Dual luciferase assay in HEK293T cells co-transfected with WT or
  mut Rheb 3'-UTR luciferase vectors and miR-199a-3p/5p mimic or NC mimic. (L) The
  mRNA levels of Rheb were detected by qRT-PCR in A549 and H1299 cells transfected
  with miR-199a-3p/5p mimic or NC after 48 h. (M and N) Protein levels of Rheb in
  miR-199a-3p/5p-overexpressing cells. Representative images (M) and quantitative
  data (N) are shown. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
