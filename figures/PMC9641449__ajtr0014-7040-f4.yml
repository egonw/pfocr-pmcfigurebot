caption: 'Low expression of IMPDH2 inhibits the effect of genistein on lung cancer
  cells. A: CCK-8 detected the effect of IMPDH2 inhibition on the viability of A549
  cells treated with genistein; B: The effect of IMPDH2 inhibition on the apoptosis
  of A549 cells treated with genistein was detected by flow cytometry; C, D: Western
  blot and qPCR verified the effect of IMPDH2 inhibition on protein and mRNA expressions
  in A549 cells treated with genistein. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.'
article_title: Genistein promotes apoptosis of lung cancer cells through the IMPDH2/AKT1
  pathway.
