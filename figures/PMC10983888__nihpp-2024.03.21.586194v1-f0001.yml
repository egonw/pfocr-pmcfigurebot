figure_title: Activity-guided biochemical fractionation and proteomics identifies
  PTER as a taurine N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase
caption: '(a) Schematic of the biochemical interconversion of taurine and N-acetyltaurine.(b-d)
  Rate of N-acetyltaurine synthesis (b,c) or hydrolysis (d) activity by the indicated
  mouse whole tissue homogenate. Tissues were collected from 10 to 14-week-old male
  C57BL/6J mice (N=3/tissue). Reactions were performed using 100 μg tissue homogenates
  at 37°C for 1 hr with 10 mM acetate and 10 mM taurine (b), 10 mM acetyl-CoA and
  10 mM taurine (c), or 100 μM N-acetyltaurine (d).(e,f) Rate of N-acetylaturine synthesis
  (e) and hydrolysis (f) activity in the indicated fraction of total kidney lysate.
  Reactions were performed as in (b).(g,h) Relative N-acetyltaurine synthesis (blue
  traces), hydrolysis (orange traces), and protein concentrations (grey traces) by
  the indicated fraction following anion exchange chromatography(g) or size exclusion
  chromatography (h).(i) Byonic P-values of proteins identified in fraction 20 following
  size exclusion chromatography.(j-m) Rate of N-acetyltaurine synthesis (j,l) or hydrolysis
  (k,m) activity from HEK293T cell lysates after transfection with the indicated plasmids
  (j,k) or from control or PTER-KO cell lysates (l,m). Reactions were conducted with
  100 μg cell lysates at 37 °C for 1 hr with 10 mM acetate and 10 mM taurine (j,l)
  or 100 μM N-acetyltaurine (k,m). N=3/group. (j,l) insert: Western blot using an
  anti-Flag antibody of HEK293T cell lysates two days after the indicated transfection
  (j) or in WT and PTER-KO cells (l).(n) Schematic of revised taurine metabolic pathway
  showing the role of PTER as a bidirectional taurine N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase.For
  (b-f) and (j-m), data are shown as mean ± SEM. In (c), P-value were calculated by
  Student’s t-test. In (j-m), P-values were calculated from two-tailed unpaired t-tests.
  All experiments were repeated twice and similar results were obtained.'
