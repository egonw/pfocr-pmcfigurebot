caption: Osteoclastogenic examination. (A) Morphological examination after TRAP staining.
  First, 20 ng/mL RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with CRE-SD-free POPC liposomes
  (CRE-SD-FREE-LIP) and 20 µg/mL liposomal CRE-SD were stained. The arrows indicate
  stained granules. (B) Percentage of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells in 20 ng/mL
  RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and 20 µg/mL liposomal
  CRE-SD. (C) TRAP activity of 20 ng/mL RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The CRE-SD-FREE-LIP
  and liposomal CRE-SD (5, 10, and 20 µg/mL) were incorporated into the cell samples.
  (D) Morphological examination after immunocytochemistry analysis of F4/80 was performed.
  RANKL-unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and 20 ng/mL RANKL-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 cells treated with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and 20 µg/mL liposomal CRE-SD were
  examined. Arrows indicate F4/80-positively stained cells. (E) The percentage of
  F4/80-positively stained cells. RANKL-unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with
  CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and 20 ng/mL RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP
  and 20 µg/mL liposomal CRE-SD were utilized. (F) RT–PCR analysis of osteoclast markers
  (CTSK, c-Fos, and NFATc1); 20 ng/mL RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were treated
  with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP and liposomal CRE-SD (10 and 20 µg/mL). (G) CTSK/GAPDH ratio.
  (H) c-Fos/GAPDH ratio. (I) NFATc1/GAPDH ratio. Statistically significant differences
  between the corresponding samples and the control are denoted as * p < 0.05, n =
  3.
