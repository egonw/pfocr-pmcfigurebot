caption: A Western blotting shows the expression of pSTAT3 and pERK in KYSE30 WT,
  ERK1/2-DKO-1, and ERK1/2-DKO-2 after EGF (50 ng/ml), OSM (10 ng/ml), or IL-6 (10 ng/ml)
  treatment. B KYSE150 WT and ERK1/2-DKO cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml), OSM
  (10 ng/ml), or IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Expressions of pSTAT3 and pERK were determined
  using western blotting. C RNA-seq heat map analyses of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) involved in the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway after trametinib or DMSO
  treatment. A fold change cutoff of log2 < −0.58 or >0.58 and a p value cutoff of
  P < 0.05 were selected and overlapped for JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway genes. D qRT-PCR
  results show the transcription level of SOCS3 mRNA after trametinib treatment at
  various time points. Error bars represent the mean ± SD. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  E KYSE30 and KYSE150 cells were incubated with trametinib (1 μM) for 0, 1, 2, 4 h,
  immunoblotted for SOCS3 expression. F, G Western blotting results show the expression
  of SOCS3 after EGF (50 ng/ml) treatment in WT, ERK-DKO KYSE30 (F) and KYSE150 (G)
  cells. H KYSE30 ERK1/2-DKO cells stably expressing EV, ERK2-HA, and ERK2-K54R-HA
  were used for western blotting to determine SOCS3 expression. I Western blotting
  results show the expression of pSTAT3 and Flag-SOCS3 in KYSE30 and KYSE150 cells
  transduced with EV or Flag-SOCS3. Trametinib (1 μM) treatment was applied at various
  time points. J Western blotting results show the expression of pSTAT3 and pERK1/2
  in KYSE30 and KYSE150 cells infected with shNC or shSOCS3 lentiviral with two target
  sites.
