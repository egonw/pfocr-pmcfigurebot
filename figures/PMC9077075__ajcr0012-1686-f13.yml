caption: Effects of anti-tumor drugs on phosphorylation of mTOR-pathway enzymes. Western
  blot analysis shows the COL6A3, mTOR, phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR), Rictor,
  phosphorylation of Rictor (p-Rictor), AKT, phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) (Thr308),
  and p-AKT (Ser473) in COL6A3-silenced ES2 and ES2TR160 tumorspheres (TS), treated
  without (-) or with 5-Aza-dC, RAD001, or 5-Aza-dC combined with RAD001. The blots
  were cropped from the original blots. The numbers in the immunoblot represent the
  relative folds of COL6A3, p-mTOR, p-Rictor, p-AKT (Thr308), and p-AKT (Ser473) in
  COL6A3-silenced ES2 and ES2TR160 TS, treated without (-) or with 5-Aza-dC, RAD001,
  or 5-Aza-dC combined with RAD001 compared to ES2 and ES2TR160 TS. The numbers in
  the immunoblot were calculated as target protein density/target protein+GAPDH density
  and set the control group in ES2 and ES2TR160 TS without treatment as 1.
