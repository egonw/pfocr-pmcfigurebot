caption: 'Schematic representation of molecular apoptosis pathways regulates by GLA.
  (1) GLA causing oxidative stress by ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, additionally,
  (2) has been report downregulation of mitochondrial CPT I, hexoquinase, and mitochondrial
  respiratory chain complexes I+III and IV, high levels of MDA. (3) Another mechanism
  reported is ROS/ASK1/JNK/p38 MAPK pathway. (4) All these events trigger intrinsic
  apoptosis by downregulation of Bcl-Xl, Bcl-2, upregulation of Bad, causing loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential, and subsequent release of cytochrome c, activation
  of caspase-9 and -3, (5) leading to cleavage of PARP and DNA fragmentation. GLA:
  Gamma-linolenic acid. ROS: Reactive oxygen species. CPT I: carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I. MDA: malondialdehyde. ASK1: Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1. JNK: c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase. P38 MAPK: p38 MAP Kinase. Bcl-Xl: B-cell lymphoma-extra-large.
  Bcl-2: Bad: Bcl-2 associated agonist of cell death. PARP: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.
  DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.'
