caption: (A, B) Effect of intermittent fasting, starvation, exercise and honey on
  adiponectin (a), ghrelin (b), and irisin (c) activities in naïve male Wistar rats.
  Bars represent mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6) (one‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post
  hoc test). (A) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 relative to controls.
  bp < 0.05 relative to intermittent fasting group; cp < 0.05 relative to exercise
  group. dp < 0.05, ddp < 0.01, dddp < 0.001 relative to honey group. (B) ****p < 0.0001
  relative to controls. ap < 0.05, aaaap < 0.001 relative to diabetic group. bbp < 0.01,
  bbbbp < 0.0001 relative to intermittent fasting group; cp < 0.01, ccccp < 0.0001
  relative to exercise group. ddp < 0.01, dddp < 0.001, ddddp < 0.0001 relative to
  honey group
