figure_title: Experimental activation of CAD can drive STING-dependent invasion in
  vitro
caption: A HaCaT cells with a deletion in endogenous ICAD were engineered to express
  an AID-ICAD-GFP construct. Cells were treated with auxin (20 µM) over 24 h. Western
  blot shows loss of ICAD and the appearance of a DNA-damage response (γH2AX) over
  time. B HaCaT AID-ICAD-GFP cells (see A) were further modified by the CRSIPR/Cas9-mediated
  deletion of STING. Cells were treated with solvent (DMSO) of auxin (20 µM) for 6 h.
  Auxin was washed out, and culture was continued for 24 h. Cells were stained with
  DAPI and beta-tubulin and assessed by microscopy for micronuclei. A minimum of 10,000
  cells per group were counted. Symbols give the percentages of micronucleus-positive
  cells per high power field. Columns/error bars are mean/SD of 10 high power fields.
  **p < 0.01. C Chromosome missegregation in HaCaT AID-ICAD-GFP cells (control or
  additional deficient in STING as in B). A minimum of 500 anaphase/ telophase/ metaphase
  cells were counted and analyzed for mitotic defects. Data shown are means/SD of
  three independent experiments. p < 0.05. D HaCaT AID-ICAD-GFP cells (control or
  additional deficient in STING as in B) were treated with auxin (20 µM) and tested
  for invasion through a Matrigel basement matrix. The percentage of cells that had
  migrated after 24 h is shown. Data shown are means/SD of 4–5 independent experiments.
  **p < 0.01.
