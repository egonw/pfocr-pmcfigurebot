caption: Expression changes of DEGs that were candidate genes for the circadian light
  input pathway. The opblue (opsin, blue-sensitive, LOC100121036) gene encodes for
  a blue-sensitive photopigment that is involved in circadian photoentrainment. cry2
  (cryptochrome 2, LOC100122802) and npas2 (neuronal pas domain-containing protein
  2, LOC100123168, a possible paralogous gene of the two clock genes) are two core
  clock genes that were triggered by light. beta-trcp (LOC100122997) is a possible
  homolog of the slimb gene in Drosophila, which is involved in the regulation of
  the circadian clock. tra (transformer, LOC100121203) is involved in sex determination,
  but also plays a role in photoperiodic regulation. jhamt (juvenile hormone acid
  O-methyltransferase, LOC100120870) is involved in the synthesis of juvenile hormone,
  which plays a role in diapause induction. circadian-clock-controlled protein-like
  (LOC100114918) is a potential clock output gene, but there is no specific information
  on it. The gene expression levels (raw counts) of these DEGs were normalized using
  rlog data transformation (statistical significance for upregulation or downregulation
  is indicated by an asterisk).
