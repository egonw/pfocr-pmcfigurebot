caption: 'Proposed Schematic. NRF2 activation promotes KYNU upregulation in lung adenocarcinoma,
  resulting in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by elevated
  tumor T-cell infiltration, including T regulatory TILs, and concordant increases
  in protein expression of immune checkpoint blockade-related PD1 and PD-L1 and poor
  prognosis. Abbreviations: AFMID—arylformamidase; AH—anthranilate hydroxylase; IDO—indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase; KEAP1—Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; KMO—kynurenine 3-monooxygenase;
  KYNU—kynureninase; NRF2—nuclear factor erythroid factor 2-related factor 2; PD1—programmed
  cell death protein-1; PDL1—programmed cell death ligand-1; sMAF—small musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma proteins; TDO—tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; Treg—regulatory T-cell.'
