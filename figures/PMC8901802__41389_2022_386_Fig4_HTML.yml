figure_title: RPS15A partially restored the inhibition of gastric cancer cell proliferation
  induced by shPSMC2 or Torin1
caption: 'A CCK8 assay was used to analyze the proliferation of AGS and MGC-803 cells
  after upregulating RPS15A or downregulating PSMC2. B Transwell assay were conducted
  to determine the changes in the migration ability of gastric cancer cells after
  upregulating RPS15A or downregulating PSMC2. C AGS and MGC-803 cells overexpressing
  RPS15A were treated with or without Torin1 (60 μM), and the subjected to CCK8 assay
  to assess the proliferation. D AGS and MGC-803 cells overexpressing RPS15A were
  treated with or without Torin1, and the subjected to flow cytometry to assess the
  apoptosis levels. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared with NC or Control
  group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, compared with RPS15A overexpression
  or PSMC2 knockdown group or Control+Torin1 group. Error bars meant SD.'
