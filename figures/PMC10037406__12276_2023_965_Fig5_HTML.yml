figure_title: Posttranslational modification in the cGAS-STING pathway
caption: Mitochondrial stress induces the release of mtDNA and subsequently activates
  the cGAS-STING pathway. This signaling pathway can be regulated by various posttranslational
  modifications and can also be suppressed by caspases during apoptosis.
