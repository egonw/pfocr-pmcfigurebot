caption: The overview of miR-942 contribution in different cellular pathways, which
  mediated mechanisms involved in cancer progression. Totally, miR-942 working as
  oncogene to regulate genes such as Apoptosis, which by own have interactions with
  cell cycle control. In the other side, miR-942 have a hand in controlling the pathways
  of transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways, Wnt pathway, JAK/STAT pathway,
  PI3K/AKT pathway, hippo signaling pathway, lectin pathway, interferon gamma signaling,
  signaling by GPCR, developmental genes, nuclear factor kappa B pathway, Mesodermal
  commitment pathway, and T-cell receptor signaling, which targeted by miR-942 and
  also involved in carcinogenesis, and other pathways which all of them function in
  cell proliferation and oncogenesis. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
