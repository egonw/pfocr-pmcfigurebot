caption: Graphic abstract shows that endothelial cell-expressing S1pr2 plays an important
  role in post-ischemic angiogenesis and blood flow recovery via AKT/eNOS signaling
  pathway in peripheral artery disease, and that EC-targeted therapy against S1pr2
  might be a potential and novel intervention for patients with peripheral artery
  disease.
