caption: TME immune cell infiltration and biological process characteristics in distinct
  hypoxia response patterns. (A) Hierarchical clustering of TME infiltration immune
  cells for 403 patients in the meta-BLCA cohort. Rows represent relative amount of
  each immune cell, and columns represent BLCA samples. Red represents relative upregulation
  and blue represents relative downregulation of each immune cell. The NEC clusters
  are shown as patient annotations. (B) ssGSEA showed the relative activity of biological
  pathways in distinct necroptosis-related gene expression patterns in the meta-BLCA
  cohort. The heatmap was used to visualize indicated biological processes, including
  immune activation, antigen processing, mismatch repair, pathway in cancers, etc.
  Red represents that the pathways were relatively activated and blue represents that
  the pathways were relatively suppressed in each sample. The NEC clusters were used
  as sample annotations. (C) Difference in the enrichment of indicated signatures
  to represent specific biological processes, including stromal-activation-relevant
  signatures, mismatch-repair-relevant signatures and immune-activation-relevant signatures
  among four distinct necroptosis-related genes expression patterns in the meta-BLCA
  cohort. (D) Differences in the expression levels of MHC molecules, costimulatory
  molecules and adhesion molecules among four distinct necroptosis-related gene expression
  patterns in the meta-BLCA cohort. In (C) and (D), the upper and lower ends of the
  boxes represent the interquartile range of values. The lines in the boxes represent
  the median value and the black dots show outliers. The statistical difference among
  four distinct necroptosis-related genes expression patterns was tested by a one-way
  ANOVA test. **** p < 0.0001.
