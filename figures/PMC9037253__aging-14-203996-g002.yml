caption: Biological functions of circ_6014 in breast cancer cells. (A, B) Expression
  levels of circ_6014 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after transfection with the
  second small interfering RNA and circ_6014 plasmids. (C, D) MTT assays of both cell
  lines showed that the proliferation was inhibited (C) or promoted (D) with decreased
  or overexpressed levels of circ_6014. (E, F) Colony formation assays showed that
  the down- or upregulated level of circ_6014 suppressed (E) or enhanced (F) the cellular
  colony-forming capacity. (G, H) Transwell assays showed that migration and invasion
  were suppressed (G) by downregulating circ_6014 expression and promoted (H) by upregulating
  circ_6014 expression. (I, J) The percentage of cell cycle distribution of the G0/G1,
  S, and G2/M phases with down- or upregulation of circ_6014 expression in both breast
  cancer cells; circ_6014 could affect the progression of G0/G1 phase. (K) Protein
  levels of CDK2, CCNE1, CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, and PCNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
  decreased after decreasing the expression of circ_6014. (L) Columns were used to
  quantify the cell cycle protein expression levels in (K) relative to β-actin. (M)
  Protein levels of CDK2, CCNE1, CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, and PCNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells increased after increasing the expression of circ_6014. (N) Columns were used
  to quantify the cell cycle protein expression levels in (M) relative to β-actin.
