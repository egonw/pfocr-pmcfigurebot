caption: The expression of signaling moleculesHMGB1, p-NF-ΚB, NF-ΚB, and p-STAT3 was
  inhibited in BELL7402 cells after ozonated water treatment. (A) The expression of
  signaling moleculesHMGB1, p-NF-ΚB, NF-ΚB, and p-STAT3 proteins detected by Western
  Blot. (B) The expression of signaling moleculesHMGB1, p-NF-ΚB, NF-ΚB, and p-STAT3
  proteins were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s test.**P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001, n=3.
