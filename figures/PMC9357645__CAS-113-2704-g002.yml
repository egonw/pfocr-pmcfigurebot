caption: Depletion of CD73 inhibits invadopodia formation in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. A, Correlation analysis between NT5E expression and
  gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores of biological processes. The top 10 correlated
  biological processes with Spearman correlation coefficients are shown in the left
  panel, and the correlation dot plot of NT5E and GSVA score of “invadopodium” is
  shown in the right panel. B, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results of invadopodia‐related
  biological processes. C, Western blot detecting the expression of invadopodia‐related
  markers in CAL27 and HN4 cells transfected with si‐NC and si‐CD73. D, Double fluorescence
  staining with phalloidin to label F‐actin and anti‐cortactin antibody for si‐NC–
  or si‐CD73–transfected CAL27 and HN4 cells. E, Fluorescent gelatin degradation assay
  evaluating the invasion ability of invadopodia in si‐NC– or si‐CD73–transfected
  CAL27 and HN4 cells. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
