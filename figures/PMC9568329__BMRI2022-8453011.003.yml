caption: 'PUR reversed increase of apoptosis and decrease of migration and invasion
  in the HeLa cells. The cells were treated with or without RES and PUR for 24 h or
  36 h. (a) The EC50 of PUR was calculated according to viability of cells by CCK-8.
  The apoptosis (b and c), migration (d and e), and invasion (f and g) of cells were,
  respectively, detected by flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assay. All
  date was from 3 independent experiments (∗p < 0.05, Tukey test). Control (Ctrl):
  HeLa cells were treated with DMSO; RES: HeLa cells were treated with RES; PUR: HeLa
  cells were treated with PUR; RES + PUR: HeLa cells were cotreated with RES and PUR.'
