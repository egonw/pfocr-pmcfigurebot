caption: The role of oxidative stress on DR And CVD (By Figdraw). Hyperglycemia induces
  the activation of PKC pathway, the increase of polyol pathway flux, the activation
  of hexosamine pathway and the accumulation of AGEs, which promote oxidative stress.
  In addition, insulin resistance increases the flux and oxidation of FFA from adipocytes
  into arterial endothelial cells, which leads to excessive ROS production in mitochondria.
  Excessive ROS production directly leads to endothelial dysfunction or indirectly
  leads to endothelial dysfunction by uncoupling eNOS, and further induces DR and
  CVD.
