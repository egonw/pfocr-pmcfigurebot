caption: 'SPI1 regulated NMT1 to mediate GC cell viability. (a, b) SPI1 expression
  (a) and NMT1 mRNA expression (b) of AGS cells were detected through qRT-PCR after
  transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid and shSPI1. GAPDH was the loading control.
  (c, d) The mRNA expressions of SPI1 (c) and NMT1 (d) of SNU-5 cells were detected
  through qRT-PCR after transfection of shNMT1 and SPI1 overexpression plasmid. GAPDH
  was the loading control. (e) OD value of AGS cells at 48 h was assessed through
  MTT assay after transfection of NMT1 overexpression plasmid and shSPI1. (f) OD value
  of SNU-5 cells at 48 h was assessed through MTT assay after transfection of shNMT1
  and SPI1 overexpression plasmid. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. NC + shNC
  group; ∧∧p < 0.01, ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. NMT1+shNC group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. NC + shSPI1
  group; +p < 0.05, ++p < 0.01, +++p < 0.001 vs. shNMT1+NC group; △p < 0.05, △△△p < 0.001
  vs. shNC + SPI1 group. All experiments were repeated independently at least three
  times. Data were performed as the means ± standard deviation. NMT1, N-myristoyltransferase
  1; GC, gastric cancer; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; shNMT1, short hairpin
  RNA against NMT1; OD, optical density; NC, negative control; shNC, shRNA negative
  control.'
