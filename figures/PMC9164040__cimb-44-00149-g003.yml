caption: 'The molecules and the potential signaling pathway regulate the OPC proliferation
  and OL differentiation gene expression. Most of the molecules are exhibited, and
  the majority of the upstream molecules originate from the cytoplasmic membrane.
  The sign of blue arrows represents promoting, and the sign of red lines represents
  inhibiting. AC: Adenylate cyclase.'
