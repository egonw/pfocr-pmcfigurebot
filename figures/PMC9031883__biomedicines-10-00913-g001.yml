caption: Polyphosphate (polyP) regulates a variety of processes in different tissues
  in the human organism. In bone tissue, polyP stimulates osteogenesis and chondrogenesis,
  and promotes the growth and differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
  cells (MSCs). In the brainstem, it can be taken up by activated astrocytes and act
  as a mediator of signal transmission. In the cardiovascular system, polyP can be
  released within extracellular vehicles by activated platelets, where it activates
  the contact pathway of blood clotting, stabilizes fibrin clot structure, and mediates
  proinflammatory responses by activating endothelial cells (ECs).
