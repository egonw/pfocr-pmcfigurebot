caption: Effects of Gemcitabine and Trametinib on RAS pathway and the construction
  of the Trametinib resistance PDAC cell lines. (A) Trametinib on regulating the cell
  cycle and downstream signaling pathways of RAS in PDAC cells. (Original images of
  full-length blots cannot be provided because we often cut the blots prior to hybridization
  with antibodies and perform exposure). (B) CCK-8 tested the construction of the
  Trametinib resistance PDAC cell lines. (C) Colony assay revealed the Trametinib-resistant
  cell lines. The experiments mentioned above were all repeated three times. * P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Original blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. . The
  samples were derived from the same experiment and the gels were processed in parallel.
