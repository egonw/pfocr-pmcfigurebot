caption: Hyperglycemia promotes T-cell immunosuppression in mice bearing PC by enhancing
  aerobic glycolysis. (A) Flow cytometriy analysis of activated cytotoxic T-cell (CD8+
  IFN γ+) population in co-culture with primary T-cells and pancreatic cancer cells
  in high glucose (25 mM glucose) culture condition compared with normal (5.5 mM glucose)
  culture conditions. (B) Bar graphs depicting levels of soluble IL-2 of Jurkat T-cells
  cultured in media with differential glucose concentrations. (C) Bar graphs depicting
  levels of soluble IL-2 of Jurkat T-cells in high glucose or normal conditions with
  or without the conditional media of PC cells. (D) Lactate production and uptake
  of 2-DG were measured in the medium of PC cells treated with differential concentrations
  of glucose for 48 hours. (E) qPCR analysis for SLC2A1, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA in PC
  cells treated with different concentrations of glucose for 48 hours. (F) Western
  blot for SLC2A1, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA proteins in PC cells treated with differential
  concentrations of glucose for 48 hours. (G) Bar graphs depicting flow cytometry
  analysis of activated cytotoxic T-cell (INFγ+ and CD8+) population and levels of
  soluble IL-2 in co-culture with primary T-cells and PC cells pretreated with or
  without 2-DG (5 mM) in high glucose culture conditions (25 mM glucose) compared
  with normal culture conditions (5.5 mM glucose). (H) Experimental schema of generating
  hyperglycemic mouse model and alterations in mouse blood glucose levels after STZ
  treatment. (I) Representative pictures of the subcutaneous tumors for immune-competent
  C57BL/6 mice in the euglycemic group, hyperglycemic group, and hyperglycemic 2-DG-treated
  group. (J) Changes in tumor volume of different groups. (K) Flow cytometry analysis
  of infiltrating immune effectors in the subcutaneous tumors of euglycemic group,
  hyperglycemic group, and hyperglycemic 2-DG-treated group. Data presented in the
  graphs represented means ± standard deviation from 3 parallel experiments. ∗∗∗∗P < .0001;
