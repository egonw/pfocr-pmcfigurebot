caption: 'Representative images of the coexpression of KIR2DL5 and CD45 mRNA detected
  by RNAScope (left) and PVR protein expression detected by IHC (right) in the indicated
  cancer types. The gates in top right of the RNAScope images showed coexpression
  of KIR2DL5 (green) and CD45 (red) mRNA in indicated human cancers. Scale bars: 50
  μm for RNAScope images and 200 μm for IHC images.'
