caption: The expression patterns of MEK, ERK, KSR2, and P38 in female C. bowringi.
  At 4-day PE, qRT-PCR was used to detect relative expression, and the levels of expression
  in the midguts (MG), fat bodies (FB), and ovaries (OV) were compared to those in
  the heads (HE). All data in the figures were presented as mean ± SD. The different
  letters above the bars denoted statistically significant differences determined
  by one-way ANOVA with Turkey’s LSD test (α = 0.05).
