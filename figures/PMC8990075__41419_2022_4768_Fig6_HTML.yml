figure_title: CAD drives a cell-specific gene expression profile
caption: A Venn-diagrams comparing expression profiles of CAD- and STING-deficient
  Hela or MDA-MB-231 cells. The numbers of differentially expressed genes are shown.
  B Enrichment analysis of EMT-related genes in Hela CAD-deficient (left) and MDA-MB-231
  STING-deficient (right) cell lines. C Functional enrichment analysis using Fisherâ€™s
  exact test. The top-10 negatively enriched consensus terms are shown in the bar
  plots. The enrichment score presents the corresponding log10 p value.
article_title: Spontaneous activity of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway drives
  chromosomal defects, the appearance of micronuclei and cancer metastasis through
  the Caspase-Activated DNAse.
