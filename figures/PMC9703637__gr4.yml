caption: ': I) (A) Microscopic image of an A549 lung cancer cell, showing the reduced
  area identiﬁed for spectral mapping. (B) K-Means cluster map of the Raman proﬁle
  of the same reduced area. II) K-means spectra of clusters 3 (A—representing nucleoli),
  6 (B—representing nucleus), 1 and 4 (C and D, both from the cytoplasm). Spectra
  are offset for clarity. III) K-means spectrum of Cluster 5 (A), compared to the
  Raman spectrum polystyrene nanoparticles (B). Spectra are offset for clarity. (Reproduced
