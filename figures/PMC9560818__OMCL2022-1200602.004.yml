caption: 'PCAF mediated PA-induced endothelial senescence through Hippo signaling
  pathway. (a) KEGG analysis showed that PCAF may regulate endothelial senescence
  via Hippo-YAP pathway. (b) Western blotting analysis and qualification of phosphorylated
  YAP expression in HUVECs treated with PA for the indicated time points. (c) Immunofluorescence
  of YAP localization in HUVECs treated with or without PA. Scar bars, 10 μm. (d)
  Expression of total YAP proteins was analyzed by immunoblot in nuclear and cytoplasmic
  protein extractions from in HUVECs treated with or without PA. (e) and (f): HUVECs
  were transfected with YAP siRNA or overexpression plasmid. The expression of p53,
  p16, pH2A.X and p21 protein were by immunoblotting. (g) and (h) HUVECs were transfected
  with YAP siRNA or overexpression plasmid, IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression were analyzed
  by RT-PCR. (i) IHC staining and its qualification of vessels from 4w and one and
  half-year-old mice with YAP antibody. Scale bars, 100 μm. (j) and (k) HUVECs were
  transfected with PCAF siRNA or overexpression plasmid, the expression of p-YAP and
  t-YAP protein were by immunoblotting. (l) HUVECs were transfected with PCAF siRNA
  or overexpression plasmid treated with or without PA. Expression of YAP proteins
  was analyzed by immunoblot in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extractions. (m) Immunofluorescence
  of YAP localization in HUVECs infected with si PCAF or PCAF plasmid or vector. Scar
  bars, 10 μm. (n) and (o) Flag-tagged YAP or Flag-tagged PCAF was transfected into
  HUVECs before stimulated with PBS or PA for 48 h, Co-IP were performed by using
  corresponding magnetic beads. t-YAP: total YAP; p-YAP: phosphorylated YAP. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3 for each experiment. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001, n.s. P > 0.05).'
