figure_title: Transcriptional evidence of upregulation of the unfolded protein response
  and mTorc1 pathways in adipose tissue
caption: (A) Volcano plot from bulk RNA sequencing (n=7 WT and n=6 KI) of inguinal
  WAT from mice on chow diet, where significantly differentially expressed genes (Log2
  fold change >1.5 and p-FDR <0.001) are highlighted in orange. Pathway analysis using
  significantly differentially expressed genes for upregulated (B) and downregulated
  (C) Hallmark gene sets. X-axis depicts a relative gene set enrichment score. (D)
  Volcano plot from bulk RNA sequencing (n=6 per genotype) of BAT from mice on HFD,
  where significantly differentially expressed genes (Log2 fold change >1.5 and p-FDR
  <0.001) are highlighted in green. Pathway analysis using significantly differentially
  expressed genes for upregulated (E) and downregulated (F) Hallmark gene sets. X-axis
  depicts a relative gene set enrichment score. All illustrated gene sets are enriched
  with p-FDR <0.05. (G) Scatter plot of the top 100 up-/down-regulated genes from
  bulk RNA sequencing from inguinal WAT. For each gene, the fold change observed under
  HFD is plotted on the x-axis and fold change under chow diet is shown on the y-axis.
  P-values for each dietary condition are shown using size (HFD) and color (chow diet).
