caption: The distribution of root exudates and microbial taxa in rhizospheres of toxic
  and non-toxic plants(A) The volcano plot of root exudates. Root exudates were selected
  with fold change threshold (x) 5 and t-test threshold (y) 0.05. The red circles
  represent features above the threshold.(B) The correlation heatmap between microbial
  module eigengene and root exudates in toxic plants.(C) The relative abundance of
  microorganisms in the rhizosphere of toxic and non-toxic plants in ME12. Values
  are mean ± SEM of non-toxic (n = 6) and toxic plants (n = 21).The Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test compared the difference between toxic and non-toxic plants.(D) Microbial network
  structure of toxic and non-toxic plants in ME12. Node represent individual OTU.
  Node color denotes microbial phyla. A red edge indicates a positive correlation,
  while a green edge indicates a negative correlation.(E) Metabolic pathways associated
  with toxic plants. Phenylpropanoid metabolism was significantly greater in toxic
  than non-toxic plants. All enzymes and enzyme nomenclature (EC) numbers were obtained
  from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The red and blue
  arrows indicate the compound or pathway showing a significant increase/decrease.
