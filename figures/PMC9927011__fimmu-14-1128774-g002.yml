caption: Possible mechanism of abscopal effect in CRC patients. After exposure to
  ionizing radiation, the primary tumor may undergo dsDNA breaks and this will cause
  a number of reactions. On the one hand, it can cause immunogenic cell death, which
  in turn releases DAMPs. On the other hand, dsDNA breaks activate the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway, releasing type I IFN. Both of these results lead to the activation
  of DCs, which in turn activate CD8+ T cells (by presenting tumor antigens released
  from dying tumor cells) to mediate a specific anti-tumor immune response. In patients
  with metastatic tumors, when one tumor is irradiated, both of these modes can activate
  T cell activation and migration through the circulatory system to distant sites
  to induce the abscopal effect.
