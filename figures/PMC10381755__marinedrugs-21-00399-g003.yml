caption: Conceptual summary of the mechanism of n-3 PUFA on musculoskeletal health.
  n-3 PUFA activates mTORC-1 signaling pathway, by phosphorylation of involving protein
  kinases. It also increases the expression amino of acid transporter, allowing more
  substrates for protein synthesis. n-3 PUFA improves mitochondrial function by increasing
  mitochondrial Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) sensitivity. n-3 PUFA displaces omega-6
  fatty acid on membranes, resulting in less production of inflammatory mediators,
  and produces pro-resolution mediators, constituting less muscle protein breakdown.
  Omega-3 reduces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression through the inhibition of nuclear
  factor kappa B. n-3 PUFA directly decreases intracellular protein breakdown. Together,
  they result in a greater muscle quantity. Lastly, n-3 PUFA modulates neurotransmission,
  resulting in greater muscle strength. The ↑ symbol represents an increase, while
  the ↓ symbol represents a decrease.
