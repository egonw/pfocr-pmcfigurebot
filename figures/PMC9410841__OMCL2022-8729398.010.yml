caption: 'COG1410 improved the survival rate and long-term neurological function 28
  days after cerebral I/R. (a) The survival rate in different groups. (b) Escape latency
  of mice in the training trials. (c) Frequency of platform crossing in the probe
  trial. (d) Percentage of time spent in the target quadrant in the probe trial. (e)
  Swimming speed in the probe trial. (f) Swimming trajectory of mice of each group
  in the probe trial. Data were represented as mean ± SEM. Survival rate, n = 15 per
  group; MWM, n = 8 per group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P
  < 0.01 vs. I/R + Vehicle group.'
