caption: The stress-induced NRF2 antioxidant system can activate a series of downstream
  genes which ultimately leads toward lung cancer carcinogenesis and progression.
  Genes activated by the NRF2 transcription factor include those related to glutathione
  metabolism, thioredoxin-based antioxidant system, NADPH regeneration and heme and
  iron homeostasis. Subsequent effects, such as detoxification, reactive oxygen species
  removal, pentose phosphate pathway and inhibition of ferroptosis then follow.
