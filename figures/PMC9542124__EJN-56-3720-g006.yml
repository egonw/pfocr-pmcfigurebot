caption: 'Higher blood pressure in GC‐C KO mice when compared with their WT littermates.
  Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate,
  tail blood volume and blood flow were measured for separate strains (a; WT: n = 6;
  GC‐C KO: n = 5; UGN KO: n = 6), GC‐C littermates (b; GC‐C WT: n = 6; GC‐C KO: n = 6)
  and UGN littermates (c; UGN WT: n = 5; UGN KO: n = 6). GC‐C KO animals had higher
  systolic, diastolic and MAP than their WT (GC‐C WT) littermates, although no difference
  was found in UGN littermates. Data were analysed with unpaired ANOVA test with post
  hoc Tukey test (a) or unpaired students t‐test (b and c). *p = .026 statistically
  significant difference of systolic blood pressure between GC‐C KO and GC‐C WT littermates.
  #p = .009 statistically significant difference of diastolic blood pressure between
  GC‐C KO and GC‐C WT littermates. $p = .011 statistically significant difference
  of MAP between GC‐C KO and GC‐C WT littermates. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
