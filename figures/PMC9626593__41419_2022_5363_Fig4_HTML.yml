figure_title: TXNRD1 activates the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway to enhance the proliferation
  and metastasis of HCC cells
caption: A TXRND1 was knockdown by two different shRNA in Bel-7402 and MHCC-97H cells.
  TXNRD1 was overexpressed in HLF and Alex cells. The expression of Akt, p-Akt, mTOR,
  and p-mTOR was detected by western blot. B Western blot was performed to detected
  the level of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Occludin, Snail, ZO1,p21 in the indicated cells
  with TXRND1 knockdown or overexpression. C Immunofluorescence images of EMT markers
  in Bel-7402 and HLF cell described in A and B. D Proliferation abilities of HCC
  cells treated with SC79 (10 μM) or MK2206 (5 μM) were investigated by cell growth
  curve and CCK-8 assay. E Cells migration and invasion abilities in indicated cells
  treated with SC79 (10 μM) or MK2206 (5 μM) were determined by transwell assay. F
  After treatment with SC79 (10 μM) or MK2206 (5 μM) for 24 hours, protein levels
  of indicated makers were analyzed by western blot analysis in the indicated cell
  lysates. G Western blot assays for TXNRD1, PTEN and Trx1 expression in the Bel-7402
  and HLF cells. H Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in Bel-7402 cells, silencing
  of TXNRD1 enhanced Trx1-PTEN interaction, whereas in HLF cells, TXNRD1 overexpression
  attenuated Trx1-PTEN interaction. I To prevent de novo PTEN biosynthesis, 5 μg/ml
  cycloheximide (CHX) was used for indicated time intervals. Expression of PTEN and
  TXNRD1 was determined by western blot in CHX experiment (left). Protein half-life
  of PTEN was quantitatively defined (right). Data represent the mean ± SEM. ns, not
  significant; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. P values were calculated by Student’s t test.
