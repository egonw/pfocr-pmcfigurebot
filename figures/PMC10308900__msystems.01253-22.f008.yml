caption: (A) Metabolic map showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to
  arginine catabolism. DEGs are placed in the corresponding metabolic reaction with
  a color-based scale. Expression values are depicted in the heat map as Log2FC. Genes
  most upregulated at 3% NaCl (blue) correspond to the arginine deiminase pathway
  (arcABCD). Genes involved in the arginine succinyltransferase system (AST) were
  also upregulated at high salinity. (B) Gene map of the arginine deiminase system
  in RM-71 genome. The NCBI locus tag and the corresponding fold change (FC) value
  are displayed for each gene. (C) Moeller’s test results for arginine decarboxylation/deamination
  of ∆arcA, RM-71wt (wild type), and non-inoculated control (C-). The light violet
  color observed in ∆arcA strain suggests the activity of other arginine-based alkalinizing
  enzymes. (D) Graph showing RM-71wt and ∆arcA viability after 16 hours of incubation
  at pH 4 in TSB-1 and TSB-3 and supplemental L-arginine (10 mM). A Student’s t-test
  was used to assess statistical significance (***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01; ns, not significant).
  (E) Graph showing swimming motility diameters of RM-71 and ∆arcA in TSB-1 and TSB-3
  supplemented with 10-mM L-arginine (L-arg) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
  ∆arcA motility is significantly reduced in the presence of L-arg at 1% NaCl. Data
  represent the mean ± SD from three biological replicates and two independent experiments.
