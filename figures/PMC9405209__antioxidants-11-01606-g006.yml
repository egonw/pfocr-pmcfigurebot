caption: Interaction among oxidative stress genes, transcription factors, and miRNAs
  in the post-transcriptional regulation (A) Venn diagram analysis of differentially
  expressed (DE) miRNAs from our RNA-sequencing (Seq) and miRNAs targeting oxidative
  stress genes predicted by miRWalk2.0. (B) One upregulated miRNA and three downregulated
  miRNAs were validated by qPCR. Heatmap shows the relative expression levels of the
  miRNAs. (C) Venn diagram analysis of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs from our
  RNA-sequencing (Seq) and miRNAs targeting transcription factor genes predicted by
  miRWalk2.0. (D) Three upregulated miRNAs and five downregulated miRNAs were validated
  by qPCR. Heatmap shows the relative expression levels of the miRNAs. Comparisons
  were performed using a Studentâ€™s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
