caption: The molecular regulatory interaction network. (a) Atherosclerosis-related
  pathways investigated for miR-124 and miR-16 by DIANA miRPath, (b) Pathways involved
  in atherosclerosis pathogenesis determined by KEGG pathway analysis (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html)â€“.
  Selected genes have important roles in these pathways. (c) The enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of pathogenesis pathways in atherosclerosis. Red rectangles represent the selected
  genes (CETP, ApoB, ApoCIII, MTTP, PCSK9, LPA, and HMGCR).
