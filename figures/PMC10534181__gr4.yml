caption: Pathway analysis of DEPs related to amino acid and protein metabolism. The
  colors used in the ribosomal pathway (top left) include blue, pink and yellow to
  distinguish between different proteins The red box reprents up-regulated proteins
  and blue indicates down-regulated proteins in the mapped metabolic network pathways.
