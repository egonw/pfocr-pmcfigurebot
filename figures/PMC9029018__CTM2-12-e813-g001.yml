caption: 'High Kindlin‐1 expression is associated with the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) pathway in head and neck and lung tumors. (A) Correlation between
  EGFR and Kindlin‐1 mRNA expression levels in head and neck tumours from The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 515) (Spearman''s rank correlation test). (B) Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot showing the enrichment of the EGFR pathway in head
  and neck tumours with high mRNA expression of Kindlin‐1 (n = 64/515). (C) Representative
  images of Kindlin‐1 immunohistochemical staining in head and neck tumours presenting
  high or low levels of EGFR. (D) Kaplan–Meier plots showing the overall survival
  of TCGA head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with respect to EGFR and Kindlin‐1
  expression. (E) Correlation between EGFR and Kindlin‐1 mRNA expression levels in
  lung tumours from OncoSG (n = 169) (Spearman''s rank correlation test). (F) GSEA
  plot showing the enrichment of the EGFR pathway in lung tumours with high mRNA expression
  of Kindlin‐1 (n = 36/169). (G) Representative images of Kindlin‐1 immunohistochemical
  staining in lung tumours wild‐type for the EGFR gene or harbouring an EGFR mutation.
  (H) Kaplan–Meier plots showing the overall survival of TCGA lung cancer patients
  with respect to EGFR and Kindlin‐1 expression. For Kaplan–Meier analyses, patients
  were divided into three categories: low expression of both EGFR and Kindlin‐1 (blue
  line); single overexpression of EGFR or Kindlin‐1 (green line); concomitant overexpression
  of EGFR and Kindlin‐1 (red line) (log‐rank test)'
