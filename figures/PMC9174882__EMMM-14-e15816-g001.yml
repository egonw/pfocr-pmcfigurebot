  Blimp1 fl/fl mouse
caption: AP3 splenocytes (5 × 105) were implanted IV into congenic CD45.1+ mice and
  resultant lymphomas that developed were evaluated for expression of B‐ and T‐cell
  lineage markers by flow cytometry. Top plots are of a control C57bl/6J (CD45.2+)
  spleen. Bottom plots show immunophenotype of splenocytes from a CD45.1 mouse with
  an expanded CD45.2+ lymphoma. The data are representative of five animals.BFlow
  cytometry analysis of CD4 expression on lymphomas cells from four mice at different
  passages (P3‐P6). In top panel, CD8−TCRβ+ cells are gated. IHC for CD4 in P3 and
  P5 spleens. Each IHC image is representative of 3 mice.CFlow cytometric TCRvβ repertoire
  analysis of whole spleens from two lymphoma passages. Each color represents the
  relative usage of a single TCRvβ on total Thy1+CD3+ T‐cells containing a mix of
  lymphoma cells and host T‐cells. The percent of positive stained cells was normalized
  to the sum of total TCRvβ+ cells. Data are representative of two experiments and
  all passages.DT‐cell transcript complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequencing
  of C57bl/6J (top) and lymphoma‐bearing spleen. The chord diagram shows numbers of
  distinct TRBV and TRBJ clones. The dominant CDR3 sequence in the lymphoma is CASGDTQANSDYTF.
  Trbv13‐2 gene corresponds to TCRvβ8.2 protein.ECD8‐TCRβ8mid T‐cell quantification
  across lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. Samples were collected from three lymphoma‐bearing
  mice with low, medium, and high tumor burden. Data are compared to that of a lymphoma‐free
  mouse (tumor burden = “none”). The CD4 and CD8 expression pattern of gated TCRvβ8+
  cells is shown in the dot plot at right. Sizes of tumor dissemination was confirmed
  in three independent experiments.F, G(F) PCR for Cγ1‐Cre and wildtype Cγ1 alleles
  and (G), wildtype, floxed, or excised Blimp1 alleles in DNA from wildtype (wt) control
  C57bl/6J cells and purified T‐cells or CD45.2+ cells from mouse with lymphoma (T1,
  T2). PCR data were confirmed in at least three independent tests. Lad. = ladder.
