figure_title: Deregulated neutrophil response in human tissue samples obtained from
  diabetic foot ulcers
caption: AEnriched GO processes from human skin acute day 3 wounds compared to human
  DFU demonstrates processes involved in neutrophil function to be deregulated in
  DFUs compared to acute wounds.BNeutrophil gene signature comparing human skin acute
  day 3 wounds to human DFUs demonstrating decreased presence of neutrophils in human
  DFUs.CqPCR validations of neutrophil genes. n = 7 DFUs and n = 3 skin acute day
  3 wounds. **P < 0.01 (two‐tailed unpaired Student's t‐test). Data presented as mean ± SD.DIngenuity
  Pathway Analysis of predicted network shows activation of cell viability of neutrophils
  and inhibition of cell death of neutrophils in human skin wounds compared to activation
  of cell death of neutrophils in human DFUs.
