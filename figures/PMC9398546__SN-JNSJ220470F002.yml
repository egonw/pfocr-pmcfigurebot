caption: 'Potentiation induced by biased adaptation in Area 17 is selectively induced
  by optimal stimuli but interocularly transferable. A, The induction of bidirectional
  plasticity in three typical neurons exposed to preferred and nonpreferred stimuli.
  Case 1, 50% preferred spatial frequency; case 2, 150% preferred spatial frequency;
  case 3, 50% contrast. Red lines (open circle) are induced by preferred stimuli,
  whereas blue lines (solid circle) are induced by nonpreferred stimuli. Black circles
  indicate Control condition. B, Population and individual peak response change ratios
  of Area 17 neurons exposed to preferred and nonpreferred stimuli (biased-adaptation
  probability < 0.32). Black points indicate population statistical results, whereas
  gray points indicate individual data. C, Same as B, when biased-adaptation probability
  equals 0.45. D, Population statistics of peak response change ratios during transferring
  period. Neurons were initially exposed to Control stimulus using preferred or nonpreferred
  (50 or 200% SFpref) parameters (pre-Ad); then neurons were potentiated by biased-adaptation
  stimulus using preferred parameters (Trained under Preferred condition). After potentiation
  induction, neurons were immediately exposed to Control stimulation using nonpreferred
  parameters to examine transferability (Tested under nonpreferred condition, peak
  response change ratios were calculated based on pre-Ad using corresponding nonpreferred
  parameters.). Black Points indicate population peak response change ratios, and
  gray points indicate individual neuronal firing rates. E, Histogram of Ocular Dominance
  Index (n = 26) of Area 17 neurons; 1 means purely contralateral driven, −1 means
  purely ipsilateral driven. F, Peak response curves of two typical neurons in interocular
  transfer experiment. Red lines (open circle) are evoked by Trained Eye (which is
  monocularly induced), and blue lines (solid circle) are evoked by Passive Eye (which
  is covered during induction and tested after monocular induction). G, Population
  peak response change ratios of potentiation-exhibiting Area 17 neurons. Red bars
  indicate the Trained Eye, whereas blue bars indicate the Passive Eye. Error bars
  indicate SEM; ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. It is notable that we adopted
  the 12-directions protocol in these experiments, and thus the probability of the
  Control stimulus was 0.08 instead of 0.04. pre-Ad: preadaptation. n.s.: not significant
  (p ≥ 0.05).'
