caption: Induction of apoptosis in oral cancer cell lines upon PL treatment. (A) MC-3
  and HSC-4 cells were seeded for 24 h and then treated with 0, 4, and 8 μM of PL
  for 24 h. After that, cells were stained with 1× DAPI solution and examined under
  fluorescence microscope (scale bar, 100 μm). The white arrows indicate chromatin
  condensations. (B) The bar graph represents the average of five fields under a fluorescence
  microscope, and the percentage of apoptotic cells among total cells. (C) MC-3 and
  HSC-4 cells were treated with 0, 4, and 8 μM of PL for 24 h, stained with annexin
  V/PI and analyzed by FACS. (D) The bar graph represents the apoptosis ratio (sum
  of early and late apoptosis). (E) Cells were harvested to measure the levels of
  PARP, Bax and Bcl-2 proteins by Western blotting in MC-3 and HSC-4 cells. β-actin
  was used as loading control. The results are representative of three independent
  experiments (statistically significant differences, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  the control group).
