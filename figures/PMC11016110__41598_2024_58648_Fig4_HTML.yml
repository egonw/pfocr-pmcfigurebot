caption: Single unit electrophysiology recordings in OFC and DMS during cue presentation,
  premature action and correct actions in adults and adolescents. (A–F) OFC heatmaps
  for unit firing and corresponding mean firing rate (G–L). DMS heatmaps for unit
  firing and corresponding mean firing rate. The bars on the heatmaps in the left
  column depict the 500 ms change in firing rate following the task event (cue on,
  or action). Age differences in line graphs on the right (Z-score responses) are
  depicted as adults in blue and adolescents in orange. The panel events (tone on,
  premature or correct action) occurred at time 0 s. Adults (blue) but not adolescents
  (orange) show a suppression of OFC cell firing rate after premature responding (A).
  In the DMS, MSNs show age differences in response to premature responding (B). OFC
  cell firing rate was not different between adults and adolescents following correct
  responses (C). Adolescent DMS MSNs show a larger response to reward compared to
  adults (D). Numbers at the top of y-axis reflect cell counts for each group. Data
  are presented as mean + SEM. Black significant bars reflect permutation testing
  between age groups, p < 0.05.

  than adults during impulsive actions.
