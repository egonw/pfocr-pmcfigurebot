figure_title: PRR signaling controls GLR2 abundance
caption: Upon perception of various elicitors, transcription of clade 2 GLRs is strongly
  induced. Activity of GLR2.7, GLR2.8, and GLR2.9 is required for complete PTI induced
  rapid Ca2+ influx, arguing for direct regulation of those channels in that process.
  The signaling pathway leading to this activation has not been resolved yet.
