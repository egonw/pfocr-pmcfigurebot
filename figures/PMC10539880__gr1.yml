caption: Identification of miR-146a as a potent regulator for CD8+ T cell infiltration
  in HGSC(A) Correlation between tumoral miRNA expression and CD8 mRNA level in human
  HGSC tumors. Correlation analysis was performed on a list of 54 miRNAs that are
  positively correlated with overall survival (OS) for patients with HGSC. miRNAs
  that had either positive or negative correlations with CD8 mRNA level are shown.
  (B) Impact of miR-150 and miR-146a treatments on canonical pathways important for
  CD8+ T cell infiltration. miR-Ctrl, miR-150, and miR-146a were transfected into
  ID8-ip1 cells and whole-genome expression analysis was performed at 48 h post-transfection.
  Pathway enrichment analyses were performed using QIAGEN IPA software. (C) Correlation
  between tumoral miR-146a expression and CD8 mRNA level across different solid tumor
  types in TCGA. Tumor types shown include adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), bladder
  urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous
  cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL),
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney
  renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), liver hepatocellular
  carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC),
  ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), pheochromocytoma
  and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), sarcoma (SARC), stomach
  adenocarcinoma (STAD), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA),
  thymoma (THYM), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), uterine carcinosarcoma
  (UCS), and uveal melanoma (UVM). No correlation was found in colon adenocarcinoma
  (COAD), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP),
  rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). (D) Correlation
  between tumoral miR-146a expression and anti-cancer immune signatures in TCGA ovarian
  cancer dataset.
