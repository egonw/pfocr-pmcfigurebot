caption: MIR99AHG downregulation by Mtb in murine macrophages is mediated by the NF-κB
  but not the p38 signaling pathway, and MIR99AHG expression is differentially regulated
  by TLR agonists. (A–C) RT-qPCR of MIR99AHG mRNA expression in BMDMs stimulated with
  TLR-9 agonist CpG (500 nM), TLR-4 agonist LPS (100 ng/mL), and TLR-2 agonist Pam3Csk4
  (100 ng/mL). Data are representative of three pooled independent experiments. (D)
  BMDMs were pretreated for 1 h with selective pharmacological inhibitors for NF-κB
  (Bay11–7082; 10 μM), p38 (SB203580; 5 μM) and infected with Mtb HN878 for 4 h. Expression
  of MIR99AHG mRNA was detected by RT-qPCR. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of triplicates. P values are represented
  as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, Student's t-test. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  NS, not significant; TLR, toll like receptor.
