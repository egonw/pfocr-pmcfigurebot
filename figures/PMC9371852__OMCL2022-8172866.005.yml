caption: Apigenin induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the expression of Srx via regulating
  the MAPK signaling pathway in cSCC. (a, b) TPA-induced JB6 cells (a) and A431 cells
  (b) were treated with the combination of apigenin and inhibitor of MEK1/2, Binimetinib
  (5 or 10 nM), for 8 h. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Srx,
  p-Erk, and the apoptosis-related proteins BAX and Bcl2. Representative images are
  shown on the left. The bar graph on the right indicated the intensity quantification
  of the protein band relative to GAPDH or total protein (ERK). Significant difference
  was designed by ANOVA, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001vs. control (TPA-induced
  sample as control for JB6 cells). (c) Real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the
  mRNA expression of Srx in cSCC cell lines while cells were treated for indicated
  compounds. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs control by ANOVA analysis. (d) Representative
  images of cell apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry after 5 nM Binimetinib (MEK1/2
  inhibitor) treatment for 24 h, respectively, in TPA-induced JB6 (up) and A431 (down).
  The percentage of apoptosis cells after apigenin treatment with or without Binimetinib
  is shown in the bar graph. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001vs. control by ANOVA analysis. (e, f) TPA-induced
  JB6 (e) and A431 (f) were incubated with or without the MEK1/2 inhibitor (5 nM Binimetinib)
  for 24 h in the presence of 80 μM apigenin. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to
  western blotting to detect the apoptosis-associated proteins caspase 3, caspase
  8, and PARP. The bar graph showed the intensity quantification of the protein bands
  from each treatment. Significant difference was designed by ANOVA, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001vs. the apigenin-alone group.
