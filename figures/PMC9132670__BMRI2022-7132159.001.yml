caption: BRU inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 and SW480 cells in vitro. Chemical
  structures of BRU (a), NCM 460 (b), HCT-116 (c), and SW480 (d) cells were treated
  with various specified concentrations of BRU (0-160 nM) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively,
  and cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Images were formed of representative
  colonies of HCT-116 cells (e) and SW480 cells (f) treated with different concentrations
  of BRU. (g, h) Statistical analysis of cell colony formation of HCT-116 and SW480.
  All data were shown as mean ± SD from three independent trials (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P <
  0.01 vs. control).
