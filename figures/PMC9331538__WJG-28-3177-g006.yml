caption: 'Analysis of the aspect ratio (major/minor axis) of HCT116 cells, obtained
  using the Image J-NIH program. The table shows values of parameters associated to
  cell morphology: Area; perimeter; round; major axis; minor axis; and aspect radio,
  relation between major axis and minor axis (AR). Graph bars show the AR for each
  condition. The increase of the degree of cell elongation at 24 h of exposure to
  parathyroid hormone-related peptide was significantly reversed in the presence of
  the Met inhibitor. DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide;
  SU: SU11274. bP < 0.01.'
article_title: Involvement of Met receptor pathway in aggressive behavior of colorectal
  cancer cells induced by parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
