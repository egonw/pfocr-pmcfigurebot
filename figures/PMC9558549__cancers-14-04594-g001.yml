caption: An outline of the methods and organization of this study. This flowchart
  describes the multi-omics we included and the process of how we breakdown patients
  by CMS classification. We then compared CMS1 and other CMS subtypes to determine
  DEGs and DMGs. Then, the MCPcounter score was calculated and survival analysis was
  undertaken using the identified CD8+ T exhaustion cell maker and immuno-crosstalk
  gene. Pathway associations were determined for DEGs using the Reactome online browser.
  Tumor mutation burden and neoantigen were used to evaluate the CMS subtypes. Eleven
  publicly available datasets were used to validate our partial results. scRNA, single-cell
  RNA-Seq; DMG, differentially methylated gene; DEG, differentially expressed gene.
