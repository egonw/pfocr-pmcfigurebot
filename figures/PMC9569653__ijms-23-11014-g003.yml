caption: 'Pseudotime trajectories reveal that apoptosis results in different differentiation
  fates of M2c-like TAMs: (A) pseudotime differentiation trajectory of M2-like TAMs;
  (B) pseudotime shows the direction of differentiation from C1QC+ TAMs to M2a-like
  TAMs; (C) changes in the expression levels of MSR1, IGF1, HIF1A, and VEGFA with
  cell differentiation. The black dash indicates the average gene expression; (D)
  expression of apoptosis effector genes in subpopulations of M2-like TAMs. The Wilcox
  test was used to compare expression differences in dMMR and pMMR. p < 0.05 is statistically
  significant; (E) differences in hallmark pathway activity scores of M2c-like TAMs
  between dMMR and pMMR (n = 754 and 829, respectively). Proliferation-related pathways
  are marked in red, and apoptosis-related pathways are marked in blue. T values are
  from limma; (F) the heatmap shows the transcription factor regulatory activity (AUC
  z-score) obtained from the Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering
  (SCENIC) analysis. The top five TFs with upregulated transcriptional activity were
  selected for visualization in dMMR and pMMR, respectively. Limma was used to compare
  the differences in AUCs between dMMR and pMMR; (G) communication among macrophages
  via the GAS signaling pathway, which promotes cell proliferation; (H) communication
  among macrophages via the TNF signaling pathway, which promotes apoptosis.'
