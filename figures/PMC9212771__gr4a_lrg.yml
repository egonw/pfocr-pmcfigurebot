caption: Gene set enrichment analysis:(A) Gene ontology enrichment of common up-regulated
  genes. The graphs represent top 10 significantly (adjusted p-value <0.05) enriched
  biological process and molecular function as well as all significantly enriched
  cellular component terms, with darker red indicating greater significance. Count
  of genes are shown in x-axis, while the y-axis represents the GO terms.(B) KEGG
  pathway enrichment of common up-regulated genes. Significantly enriched viral infection
  pathways are indicated here with darker blue standing for greater significance;
  x-axis shows count of genes involving in each over-presented pathway and y-axis
  represents the KEGG terms.
