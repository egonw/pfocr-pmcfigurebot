caption: 'DOW and DLW inhibit MAPKs and NF-κB signal transduction in the eyeball and
  lacrimal gland of SCOP-induced DED rats. (A) The bands selected represent the effect
  of DOW on protein expression of MAPKs and NF-κB pathway in eyeball by Western blot
  in each group (n = 3). (B) Quantitative statistics of protein expression in A. The
  grey value was obtained by Image J software processing. Data were expressed as mean
  ± SEM from five rats in each group. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to control
  group individually; # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared to model group individually.
  (C) The bands selected represent the effect of DLW on protein expression of MAPKs
  and NF-κB pathway in eyeball by Western blot in each group (n = 3). (D) Quantitative
  statistics of protein expression in C. The grey value was obtained by Image J software
  processing. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM from five rats in each group. * p
  < 0.05 compared to control group individually; # p < 0.05 compared to model group
  individually. (E) The bands selected represent the effect of DOW on the protein
  expression of MAPKs and NF-κB pathway in lacrimal gland by Western blot in each
  group (n = 3). (F) Quantitative statistics of protein expression in E. The grey
  value was obtained by Image J software processing. Data were expressed as mean ±
  SEM from five rats in each group. * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 compared to control
  group individually; # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared to model group individually.
  (G) The bands selected represent the effect of DLW on protein expression of MAPKs
  and NF-κB pathway in lacrimal gland by Western blot in each group (n = 3). (H) Quantitative
  statistics of protein expression in G. The grey value was obtained by Image J software
  processing. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM from five rats in each group. * p
  < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 compared to control group individually; # p < 0.05 compared
  to model group individually.'
