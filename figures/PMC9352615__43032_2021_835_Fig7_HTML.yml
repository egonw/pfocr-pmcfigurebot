caption: A map of reported pathogenic variants of MKS. Domains are shown by the strip
  above and exons are shown below. Orange spots in the middle stand for variants we
  have counted. We denoted our novel variants by red square box at the position corresponding
  its location in real amino sequence. (One of them is in intron region so it hasnâ€™t
  been marked.) Surrounding variants are written out to prove that our variants are
  novel. (A) CEP290. (B) CC2D2A. Variant information were downloaded from NCBI ClinVar
  database, and domain information were referred to NCBI protein database, Pfam database,
  and SMART database
article_title: Three Novel Variants of CEP290 and CC2D2DA and a Link Between ZNF77
  and SHH Signaling Pathway Are Found in Two Meckel-Gruber Syndrome Fetuses.
