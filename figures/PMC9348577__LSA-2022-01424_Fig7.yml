figure_title: Dose response and MET pathway activation kinetics after i.p. injection
caption: (A) 8-wk-old FVB mice were injected with PBS (Ctrl) or different amounts
  of K1K1 after which MET, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation in liver homogenate was determined
  using Western blot. Mice were euthanized 10 min after injection. Results are presented
  as experimental duplicate (n = 2). (B) MET, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation were detected
  by Western blot at different time points after injection of 5 Î¼g of K1K1. Results
  are presented as experimental duplicate (n = 2) except for control and 10 min conditions.
  Both blots present total MET, Akt, and ERK proteins as loading controls.Source data
  are available for this figure.
