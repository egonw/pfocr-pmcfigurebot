caption: Parkinson's disease pathway map identified by the gene set enrichment analysis.
  The Parkinson's disease pathway map was selected by gene set enrichment analysis
  with differentially expressed proteins in the comparison between (A) PSP and HC
  and between (B) PSP and PD using the KEGG pathway database. The differentially expressed
  proteins identified in this study are coloured in magenta.
