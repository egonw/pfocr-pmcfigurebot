caption: Effects of PLD1 overexpression on the biological characteristics of CASKI
  cells. (A) qRT–PCR was used to verify the PLD1 mRNA level. (B) Western blot analysis
  confirmed that the expression of PLD1 was significantly increased in PC11‐PLD1 and
  PD40‐PLD1 cells. (C) The CCK‐8 assay growth curves suggested that PC11‐PLD1 and
  PC40‐PLD1 cells proliferated faster than PC11 and PC‐40 cells, and the doubling
  time of PC11‐PLD1 and PC40‐PLD1 cells was significantly shortened in comparison
  to that of PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells (35.05 ± 0.68 h vs. 40.11 ± 0.28 h, 34.78 ± 0.76 h
  vs. 41.27 ± 0.40 h, respectively, all p < 0.05). (D) Matrigel migration/invasion
  assay results showed that PC11‐PLD1 and PC40‐PLD1 cells showed a higher ability
  to invade and migrate than PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells. (E) The scratch assay results
  showed that PC11‐PLD1 and PC40‐PLD1 cells had significantly higher migration area
  percentages than PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells (52.85 ± 2.0% vs. 32.55 ± 1.70%, 57.54 ± 1.80%
  vs. 35.62% ± 4.02%, all p < 0.001). (F) Colony formation assays showed that the
  colony formation rate of PC11‐PLD1 and PC40‐PLD1 cells was significantly greater
  than that formed by the two PLD1 knockout cells (43.93 ± 2.11% vs. 73 ± 1.72%, 46.47 ± 3.28%
  vs. 74.4 ± 2.27%, all p < 0.01). (G) PC11‐PLD1 and PC40‐PLD1 showed lower sensitivity
  to cisplatin, and the IC50 values significantly increased compared with those of
  PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells (40.20 ± 3.59 μg/mL vs. 22.25 ± 3.52 μg/mL, 38.15 ± 4.26 μg/mL
  vs. 18.12 ± 2.72 μg/mL, p = 0.0035 and 0.0024, respectively)
