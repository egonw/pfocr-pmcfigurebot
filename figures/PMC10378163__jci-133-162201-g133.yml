figure_title: Ruxolitinib directly modulates aGVHD BMSC function by inhibiting the
  JAK2/STAT1 pathway
caption: (A) JAK2 and STAT1 and their phosphorylation (p) levels in BMSCs derived
  from BMT, aGVHD, and ruxolitinib-treated (R) aGVHD mice. BMT, n = 10; aGVHD, n =
  15; aGVHD+R, ruxolitinib-treated aGVHD mice, n = 10. Numbers indicate the fold change
  of protein levels normalized to BMT. (B) Inhibition of JAK2/STAT1 pathway in aGVHD
  BMSCs after incubation with different concentrations of ruxolitinib for 24 hours
  in vitro; n = 5. Numbers indicate the fold change of protein levels normalized to
  control. (C and D) Jak2 mRNA (C) and protein (D) levels in aGVHD BMSCs after transfection
  with scrambled or Jak2 shRNA. Numbers indicated the fold change of protein levels
  normalized to scrambled shRNA (C). (E) Expression of osteogenesis- (Runx2) and adipogenesis-related
  (Pparg) genes in scrambled or Jak2-deficient BMSCs after ruxolitinib treatment;
  n = 3–6 per group. (F) Response of BMSC mitochondria metabolism to ruxolitinib after
  Jak2 knockdown; n = 3–9 per group. (G) Relative mitochondria transfer from Jak2-deficient
  BMSCs to HSPCs after vehicle or ruxolitinib treatment; n = 7–8 per group. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, by 1-way ANOVA followed by unpaired, 2-tailed t test
  (E–G). KD1, knockdown 1 (shRNA 1); KD2, knockdown 2 (shRNA 2).
