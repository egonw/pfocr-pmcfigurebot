caption: Partial reversal of transcriptional regulatory changes by apple polyphenol
  treatment. (A) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes among the 3 groups. (B)
  KEGG map of differentially expressed genes between CDI and NC groups. (C) KEGG map
  of differentially expressed genes between CDI and HAP groups. Circle size shows
  number of genes enriched in the pathway, and color scale represents p value.
