caption: ENTPD1 deficiency alters multiple metabolic pathways important for lipid
  and energy metabolism. (A) Metabolite enrichment (left) illustrates molecule distribution
  of specific perturbed metabolites altered in at least two thirds of tested individuals
  (n = 37). Pathway enrichment (right) illustrates altered molecules from the same
  metabolic pathways (n = 148). In pathway enrichment, molecules may or may not be
  identical between patient samples; however, molecules fall within the same metabolic
  pathway. The distribution of these molecules across all patient samples illustrates
  the broader impact of lipid and energy metabolism due to ENTPD1 deficiency. (B)
  Geneâ€“metabolite disease pathway interaction is shown for significantly perturbed
  metabolites in plasma of patients with ENTPD1 deficiency. Metabolites assessed (n
  = 98) are limited to molecules mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  pathways. The most significantly altered pathways (p < 0.05) are labeled. ABC =
  ATP-binding cassette; CoA = coenzyme A; TCA = tricarboxylic acid; FDR = false discovery
  rate.
