caption: Heatmap of the enriched and impoverished metabolic pathways of each tested
  group mouse. The top ten enriched and least represented pathways were described
  in the heatmap. For each functional pathway, those with a relative presence of 0.01%
  or higher for both ND and HFD conditions were included in the analysis.
article_title: Molecular networking-based lipid profiling and multi-omics approaches
  reveal new contributions of functional vanilloids to gut microbiota and lipometabolism
  changes.
