caption: (a) Cell viability of HTB75 cells following treatment with DQ extract fractions
  F1–F8, and the crude extract. Cell viability was determined by XTT assay as a function
  of live cell number. Control is the vehicle-treated control (1.00% v/v methanol).
  Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 3). Levels with different Upper case letters were
  significantly different from all combinations of pairs according to the Tukey–Kramer
  honest significant difference test (HSD; p ≤ 0.05). (b,c) Cell viability of HTB75
  cells following treatment with C. sativa DQ fractions F5 and F7 (respectively) at
  different concentrations for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. (d,e) Cell viability of HTB161
  cells following treatment with C. sativa DQ fractions F5 and F7 (respectively) at
  different concentrations for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. IC50 values calculation was done
  from logistic curve fit using GraphPad Prism version 6.1. Concentration 0 was the
  vehicle-treated control (1.50% v/v methanol). Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 3).
