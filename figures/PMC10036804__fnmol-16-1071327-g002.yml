caption: 'Chronic sCT treatment had an antidepressant effect in CRS-treated mice.
  (A) In FST, the immobility time of CRS-treated mice was increased and was decreased
  after sCT treatment (Control + saline: n = 7; Depression + saline: n = 10; Depression
  + sCT: n = 10). (B) In TST, the immobility time of CRS-treated mice was also significantly
  increased and was decreased after sCT treatment (Control + saline: n = 7; Depression
  + saline: n = 7; Depression + sCT: n = 7). (C) In SPT, the sucrose preference of
  CRS-treated mice was decreased significantly and was increased after sCT treatment
  (Control + saline: n = 8; Depression + saline: n = 7; Depression + sCT: n = 7).
  The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.
