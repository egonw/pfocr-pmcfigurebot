caption: Nrf2 KO cells were resistant to the ferroptosis inducer erastin. (a) LDH
  release levels in control and Nrf2 KO cells treated with different concentrations
  of erastin for 24 h. (b) Image showing control and Nrf2 KO cells after 3 μM erastin
  treatment for 24 h in a light field. (c) LDH release levels in B. (d) Western blots
  of Nrf2, CTR1, TfR1, and GPX4 protein expression in control and Nrf2 KO cells treated
  with 3 μM erastin at different time points. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
  Scale bar, 100 μm.
