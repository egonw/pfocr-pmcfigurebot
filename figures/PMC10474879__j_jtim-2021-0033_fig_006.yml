caption: Modulation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway affected the role of Sestrin2
  in ASMCs from the asthma group. (A) CCK-8 assay analysis of cell viability. (B)
  EdU assay analysis of cell proliferation. (C) Transwell assay analysis of cell migration.
  (D) Fluo-3AM assay analysis of calcium flow. Î²-Actin served as an internal reference.
  CCK-8 analysis was repeated three times. **P < 0.01.
