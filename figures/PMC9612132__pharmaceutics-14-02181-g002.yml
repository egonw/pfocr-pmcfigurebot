caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of the influence of heparin on the signaling pathways
  responsible for the development of multidrug resistance in tumor and immune cells.
  (a) 1-Activation of GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors) induces the PI3K/Akt (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase) signaling pathway in OS. In addition, OS activates IRS (insulin receptor
  substrate). 2-Cytokines interact with CR (cytokine receptors) and activate JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway. 3-Hyperactivation of growth factor-related signaling pathways
  (RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) and downstream effectors such as Ras and Raf) is
  a common event in humans OS. NF-kB is also activated at OS. 4-High expression of
  the Notch1 receptor and its ligand Jagged2 is observed on OS. 5-Tumor cell development
  occurs under hypoxia conditions. High expression of the transcription factor HIF-1a
  is observed in the cells. 6-Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species cause oxidative
  stress. Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) is a novel regulator
  of cellular resistance to oxidants. Overexpression of Nrf2 is observed at OS. 7-The
  Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway controls important cellular processes, including
  cancer. 8-All of the above events affect the transcription of genes that are resistant
  to multiple drugs. 9-Cancer cells are characterized by high expression of multidrug
  resistance proteins. (b) Heparin has an inhibitory effect on molecules of the major
  signaling pathways involved in the development of multidrug resistance (PI3K/Akt,
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/cMyc, JAK2/STAT3, Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch1). In addition, heparin
  reduces Nrf2 overexpression and maintains it at normal levels. Heparin reduces the
  activity of the transcription factor HIF-1a in OS cells. Moreover, heparin indirectly
  (by inhibiting IRS-1) induces hyperglycemia, which negatively affects the expression
  of MDR genes (ABC: ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC10, ABCG2) in OS. In addition, a mechanism
  of a direct negative effect of heparin on ABC proteins is possible, manifested by
  an increase in the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents.'
