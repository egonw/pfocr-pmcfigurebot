caption: (a) CV of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] in CH3CN at a glassy carbon electrode under the
  conditions indicated. (b) Proposed catalytic cycle of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br]. Three main
  pathways for CO2 reduction to CO have been evidenced through a wide range of spectroscopic,
  electrochemical, and theoretical studies. These are the dimer pathway (orange),
  protonation first pathway (blue), and reduction first pathway (green). An additional
  proposed pathway to form formate or formic acid is also shown (dashed lines). Panel
