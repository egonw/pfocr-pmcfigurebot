caption: 'Signal integration mediated by stress-activated protein kinases. The stress-activated
  protein kinases (SAPKs) c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 as well as the protein
  kinases of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family are activated in response to endogenous
  and exogenous stress stimuli. Therefore, JNK and p38 are either activated directly
  or through upstream signaling cascades [mitogen-associated protein kinase kinase
  kinases (MKKKs), mitogen-associated protein kinase kinases (MKKs)] and subsequently
  exercise their functions through intracellular signal integrating effectors such
  as the transcription factors JNK, p53, c-myc, or β-catenin. In response to certain
  stress stimuli, the kinases of the CK1 family also take key functions in regulatory
  effects mediated via p53 or through various signal transduction pathways like the
  Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog (Hh), or Hippo pathway. Finally, cellular stress response
  including regulation of proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell cycle progression,
  survival, and apoptosis is initiated by modulation of gene expression. MAP: Microtubule-associated
  protein; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; MT: Microtubule; ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
