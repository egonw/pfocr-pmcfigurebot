caption: 'Signaling fluxes strongly differ between breast cancer cell lines. (a) The
  activation of the P70S6 kinase by MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways is depicted as
  the ratio of their respective activation fluxes over time. Line colors differentiate
  between ligands, whereas blue (MAPK) and green (PI3K) areas indicate the respective
  dominant pathway activating P70S6K. (b) Dominating signaling fluxes without any
  ligand or drug treatment, as supported by the data. PI3K signaling forms the main
  signaling branch in MCF7, T47D and SKBR3 (highlighted in green), while MAPK signaling
  dominates in MDA-MB-231 cells, including a negative feedback loop on c-RAF and RAS
  (highlighted in blue). Asterisks indicate activating mutations in the respective
  components (note: PIK3CA, component of the the PI3K complex, is mutated in MCF7
  and T47D).'
