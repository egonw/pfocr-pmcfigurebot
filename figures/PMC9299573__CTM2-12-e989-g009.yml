caption: GW4968 and Rab27a silencing down‐regulate miR‐20a in HCC827and H1299 cells.
  (A) Following co‐culture with cancer‐associated fibroblast (CAF)‐derived exosomes
  treated with GW4869 or shRab27a, miR‐20a expression was analyzed in HCC827 and H1299
  cells. (B) PKH67‐labelled exosomal uptake by the treated HCC827 and H1299 cells,
  with representative images being shown. (C) miR‐20a levels were measured via qPCR
  in CAFs following miR‐20a mimic or inhibitor treatment. ***p < .001 versus Control.
  (D) Relative expression of miR‐20a was assessed via qPCR in exosomes derived from
  CAFs, which were transfected with miR‐20a mimic or inhibitor. (E) After transfection
  with miR‐20a mimic or inhibitor in CAFs, CAF‐derived exosomes were collected and
  used to treat HCC827 or H1299 cells, with miR‐20a expression in these cells then
  being assessed via qPCR. ***p < .001 versus Control

  the PTEN/PI3K‐AKT pathway to promote the progression and chemoresistance of non‐small
  cell lung cancer.
