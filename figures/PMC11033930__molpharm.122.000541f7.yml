caption: Model for mechanism of MOR-Gq coincidence detection in feedback inhibition
  of MOR-dependent antinociception in presynaptic PAG input neurons in the descending
  pain pathway. Pictured is a GABAergic synapse between a PAG input and output neuron.
  The boxed inset shows the anatomic location of the PAG in the rodent brain with
  inputs from the cortex and outputs to the spinal cord. MOR activation in the presynaptic
  neuron inhibits GABA release resulting in activation of output neurons that ultimately
  suppress afferent pain transmission in the spinal cord. PLCβ3 activation suppresses
  MOR actions in presynaptic neuron, and activation of PLCβ3 requires inputs from
  both Gi/βγ from MOR and Gq from an unknown Gq-coupled receptor. Since PLCβ3 activation
  requires simultaneous Gαq and Gβγ binding, blockade of either Gαq or Gβγ is sufficient
  to relieve the PLC-dependent inhibition of MOR signaling, leading to enhanced MOR
  potency and increased antinociception. Figure created with Biorender.com.
