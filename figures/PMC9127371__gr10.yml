caption: 'ACK regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. Cartoon summarizing the points
  of influence of ACK on components of the PI3-kinase signaling pathway. Phosphorylation
  sites are shown as green circles. ACK, Activated Cdc42-associated Kinase; Akt, Ak
  strain transforming protein; EGFR, EGF receptor; InsR, insulin receptor; p50, short
  isoform of the PI3K regulatory subunit; p85, long isoform of the PI3K regulatory
  subunit; p110, PI3k catalytic subunit; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate,
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol (, , )-trisphosphate. This figure was created in Biorender.'
article_title: Assembly of nuclear dimers of PI3K regulatory subunits is regulated
  by the Cdc42-activated tyrosine kinase ACK.
