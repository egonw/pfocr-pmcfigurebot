figure_title: Integrated metabolomic-transcriptomic analysis and metabolite rescue
caption: a Spatial division displayed as PCA plot based on RNA-Seq profile of 4T1
  cells cultured with media containing either serine and glycine or not (-SG) and
  irradiated with a final dose of X-ray radiation 5 Gy (IR) for 24 h (one experiment
  in biological triplicate). b Joint pathway analysis based on both metabolomics (Fig. )
  and gene expression (Fig. 4a) profiles of 4T1 cells cultured with media containing
  either serine and glycine (+SG) or not (-SG) and irradiated with a final dose of
  radiations 5 Gy (IR) for 24 h (one experiment in biological triplicate for both
  metabolomics profiling and RNA-Sequencing). c Schematic depicting serine/glycine
  biosynthesis and related pathways, and corresponding metabolites used for rescue
  experiments. d Quantification of clonogenic assays as surviving fraction relative
  to non-irradiated controls of 4T1 cells cultured with media containing serine and
  glycine (Ctr) or not (-SG), irradiated with increasing doses of X-ray radiation
  (0–6 Gy) and with or without supplementation with 2 mM Pyruvate or 2.5 mM reduced
  glutathione and nucleosides mix (GSH & Nuc) (mean +/−SD, one experiment in biological
  triplicate, Two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple-comparisons test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005,
  ***P < 0.0005, ****P < 0.00005).
