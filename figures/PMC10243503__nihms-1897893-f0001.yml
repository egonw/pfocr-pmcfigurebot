  produce oxysterols for chylomicrons packaging and lymphatic secretion
caption: a, 7α,25-HC biosynthetic pathway from cholesterol. b, Representative flow
  cytometry plot and number of GPR183+ M12 cells migrating upon exposure to lipids
  extracts from duodenum and ileum tissue. The relative migration (A.U) was measured
  and plotted as ratio between number of migrating GFP+ M12 cells and number of migrating
  GFP- M12 cells and normalized to migration toward lipid free migration media (Nil).
  100nM of 7α,25-HC was used as positive control for the migration assay. c,d, Summary
  data of 7α,25-HC (Lipid) and 25-HC (LipidHsd3b7+Cyp7b1) quantification in IECs and
  lamina propria (LP) of duodenum and ileum from C57Bl/6 mice (d). e, M12 migration
  assay of IEC lipids from Ch25h−/− and LMC mice. f, M12 migration assay of IEC lipids
  from germ free (GF) and specific pathogen free (SPF) MyD88−/− mice and littermate
  controls. g, M12 migration assay with lipids from IECs of VillincreMyD88fl/fl and
  LTC mice. h, Relative quantification of 7α,25-HC and 25-HC in IECs from wild type
  mice fed for 24 hours with normal food (NF), food with 2% of cholesterol (HCF) and
  vegetarian food (VF). i, Schematic representation of the pharmacological activity
  of Ezetimibe (Ezt) and Mevastatin (Meva) in IECs (Created with Biorender.com). j,
  M12 migration assay with lipids from IECs of mice treated for 24hrs with 10mg/kg
  (body weight) of Ezetimibe (Ezt), 20 mg/kg (body weight) of Mevastatin (Meva) or
  vehicle (DMSO). k, M12 migration assay with 7α,25-HC from IECs, lamina propria (LP)
  and Lymph of mice treated with 3% of Pluronic81(PL81) in NF condition or (l) HCF
  (vol/vol). m, M12 migration assay with human plasma from healthy patients upon exposure
  to lipid-based meal. Plasma was separated into chylomicron and non-chylomicron fractions
  and analyzed at the indicated time point. The results were pooled from three experiments
  (c,d,e,f and g)(n=3–4 mice per group); (h,j,k and l)(n=5 mice per group) and two
  independent experiments (m)(n=3 biologically independent samples). Statistics were
  measured by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction (*p<0.05, **p<0.01,***p<0.001,
  ****p<0.0001) in (c,d,f,h and m) and two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test (e,g,j,k
  and l). Exact P values and adjustments are provided in Source data. The error bars
  represent the mean ± s.e.m.
