caption: Model-2 architecture. DSMN (consisting of 16 × 16 tiles) is similar to the
  one described in model-1. 16 × 16 NF responses were feed forwarded to 16 × 16 columns
  in HBNW. HBNW response is rearranged as 2,048 × 1 vector before it is passed to
  the output stage-multi-layer perceptron (MLP) where the neurons are trained to recognize
  the type of optic flow present in the input sequence.
