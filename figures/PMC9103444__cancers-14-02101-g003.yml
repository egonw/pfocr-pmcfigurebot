caption: Overview of the apoptosis pathways (lncRNA H19 is used as example clarifying
  the mechanism). The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by the cell itself
  in response to cytotoxic stimuli. The extrinsic pathway is initiated via death receptors
  stimulated by death ligands. When caspase 3 is activated, the two pathways merge
  and lead to cell death []. Bax channels, Bcl-2-associated protein X channels; Bcl-2,
  B-cell lymphoma 2; Bcl-xL, B-cell lymphoma extra-large; Mcl-1 induced myeloid leukemia
  cell differentiation protein 1; DISC, death inducing signalling complex.
