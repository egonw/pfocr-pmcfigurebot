caption: 'Grouping of networks based on functionally enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  and pathways related to BMI1. The functionally grouped networks are linked to their
  biological functions, where only the most significantly enriched terms in the group
  are labeled: polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1, hPRC-H), transcriptional regulation
  by E2F6, inflammatory response pathway, PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway
  in cancer, antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling pathway,
  and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion.'
