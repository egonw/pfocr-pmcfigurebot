caption: PLAC8 regulates lung cancer cell growth by regulating Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway. (a) Expression of p-Catenin in lung cancer tissues and nontumor tissues.
  (b) Lung cancer cell were treated by 100 ng/mL PLAC8 for the indicated times. (c)
  Effects of overexpression and downregulation of PLAC8 on Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway (Western blot). (d) Dual luciferase reporter gene analysis reveals that
  PLAC8 regulates Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway activity in A549 and H838 cells,
  ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗p < 0.001. All these cell biological function assays were triplicate.
