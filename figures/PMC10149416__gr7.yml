caption: UTP11 overexpression is correlated with unfavorable prognoses in breast and
  colorectal cancers (A) UTP11 protein expression is upregulated in breast cancer
  samples compared to adjacent normal tissues. Six pairs of tissues were analyzed
  by IB. (B) UTP11 mRNA expression is upregulated in breast cancer samples compared
  to adjacent normal tissues. Ten pairs of tissues were analyzed by RT-qPCR. (C, D)
  Higher expression of UTP11 is significantly associated with shorter overall survival
  in a cohort of 91 breast cancer patients. (E, F) UTP11 protein expression is higher
  in colorectal cancer samples than adjacent normal tissues. Representative images
  (E) and the graph of ten pairs of samples (F) are shown. (G, H) Higher levels of
  UTP11 are associated with worse prognoses in 150 colorectal cancer patients. (I)
  A schematic diagram for UTP11 function in cancer. In UTP11-proficient cells, p53
  is degraded through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and lipid ROS is restricted via
  NRF2 antioxidant signaling pathway (e.g., SLC7A11), which promotes cancer cell survival
  and growth (left panel). In UTP11-deficient cells, the biosynthesis of 18S rRNA
  is impaired, resulting in nucleolar stress-induced p53 stabilization and activation.
  Additionally, UTP11 depletion promotes the destabilization of NRF2 mRNA, leading
  to the downregulation of SLC7A11 and increased ferroptosis (right panel). **p < 0.01.
