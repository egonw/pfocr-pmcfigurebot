figure_title: Optimization of first-strand synthesis of agarose captured mRNA
caption: '(a) Steric capture of cellular genomic DNA inside the agarose matrix. Left:
  brightfield image of agarose gels. Right: SYBR green fluorescence of stained genomes
  inside agarose gels. Cells are loaded at limiting dilution to ensure single-cell
  encapsulation; approximately one in every ten agarose hydrogels contains a cell.
  (b) Estimated number of cells per drop based on Poisson statistics for microfluidic
  loading during FIND-seq. (c) Quantification of live cells by flow cytometry using
  AmCyan live/dead cell dye. n = 4 mice. (d) Whole transcriptome amplification (WTA)
  of cDNA covalently attached to agarose beads shows full length material is captured
  and reverse transcribed. (e) WTA yield as a function of PCR cycle number. (f) Optimization
  of cDNA capture with buffer composition, enzyme, template switch oligonucleotide
  concentration and additives (6 mM Mg2+, 1M betaine, and 7.5% PEG-8000). (g) Quantification
  of the percent mitochondrial reads in bulk FIND-seq data for each replicate. n =
  22 samples. (h) Calculation of score per cell from astrocytes derived from scRNA-seq
  from ref.  or each bulk FIND-seq replicate for the pathway GOBP: Execution phase
  of apoptosis (GO: 0097194).'
