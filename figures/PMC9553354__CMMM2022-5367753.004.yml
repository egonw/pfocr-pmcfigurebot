caption: DEGs associated with EA+MI based on microarray data. (a) Heat map of MI-CTR
  differentially expressed genes; (b) heat map of MI-CTR differentially expressed
  volcanoes; (c) heat map of EA+MI differentially expressed genes; (d) heat map of
  EA+MI differentially expressed volcanoes. Blue represents ascending genes; red represents
  descending genes. Genes marked with an asterisk have been validated in the current
  experiment.
