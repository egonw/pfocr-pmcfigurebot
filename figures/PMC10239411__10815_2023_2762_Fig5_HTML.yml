caption: Transcriptome sequencing of INHBB silencing. a Volcano plot showing DEGs
  (fold change > 2; p value < 0.05) between the control and decidual tissue following
  in vitro decidualization. b Volcano plot of decidual DEGs (fold change > 2; P value < 0.05)
  after INHBB knocked down. c Heatmap of the clustering expression profiles of DEGs
  in the three groups. con, control group; dec, decidualization group; decsiinhbb,
  decidualization with INHBB knockdown group. d Clustering of genes that upregulated
  in decidualization while downregulated by INHBB silencing. e Clustering of genes
  that induced in decidualization while decreased by INHBB silencing. f, g KEGG enrichment
  analysis of the genes from cluster1 (n = 454) and cluster2 (n = 627). h GSEA plot.
  The analysis was performed against the KEGG database of the cAMP signalling pathway.
  The x-axis represents the rank for all genes; the y-axis represents the value of
  the ranking metric. i Frequency heatmap of the DEGs belonging to the cAMP signalling
  pathway
