caption: PD-1/PD-L1 regulates PI3K pathway. The PD-1/PD-L1 regulates a number of functions
  of PI3K pathway. Both the transmembrane part and intracellular part of the PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway participate in this process. Reactions can happen in both immune cells and
  tumor cells. Arrows mean activation, and bars mean inhibition. While dotted lines
  represent PD-L1 expression. In tumor cells, after PD-L1 mRNA translation, cell-intrinsic
  PD-L1 activates Protein Kinase B (AKT). After PD-1/PD-L1 binding, Src homology-2-containing
  protein tyrosine phosphatase 2(SHP2) promotes Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
  phosphorylation through working on casein kinase 2(CK2), further promoting phosphatidylinositol
  3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to generate phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2).
