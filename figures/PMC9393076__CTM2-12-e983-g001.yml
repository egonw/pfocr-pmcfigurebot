caption: Silencing and overexpressing miR‐145‐5p markedly reverse inhibitory or activation
  of and proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in bladder cancer (BC) cell. (A)
  Knock‐down or overexpression of miR‐145‐5p significantly reversed insulin‐like growth
  factor 1 receptor (IGF‐IR) expression of T24 transfected with sh‐circOMA1 or OV‐circOMA1.
  (B–D) Knock‐down or overexpression of miR‐145‐5p significantly reversed the proliferation
  ability of T24 transfected with sh‐circOMA1 or OV‐circOMA1. (E and F) Knock‐down
  or overexpression of miR‐145‐5p significantly reversed the invasion ability of T24
  transfected with sh‐circOMA1 or OV‐circOMA1. (G and H) Knock‐down or overexpression
  of miR‐145‐5p significantly reversed the angiogenesis ability of T24 transfected
  with sh‐circOMA1 or OV‐circOMA1. (I) The qRT‐PCR showed the changes of RNA levels
  of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK)/epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  markers in T24 cells of reverse experiments. (J) The Western blotting showed the
  changes of RNA levels of MAPK/EMT markers in T24 cells of reverse experiments. (K)
  The schematic diagram of the oncogenesis role of circOMA1 in BC. The data are shown
  as the mean ± SD. *p < .05; **p < .01

  modulating IGF‐IR/MAPK/EMT pathway.
