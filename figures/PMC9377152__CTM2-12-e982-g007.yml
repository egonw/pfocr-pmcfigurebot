caption: Decreased MEN1 expression in fibrotic kidney disease samples. (A) Quantitative
  real‐time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression of Men1, Acta2, Fibronectin1,
  Col1a1, Col3a1 and ECM2 in the kidney tissues of the sham and unilateral ureteral
  obstruction (UUO) mice (n = 8 mice per group). (B) Representative images of haematoxylin–eosin
  (H&E), Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining of kidney sections from the sham
  and UUO mice; scale bars 50 μm. (C) Quantification of the interstitial fibrosis
  score, the area of Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining in the kidney tissues
  of the sham and UUO mice (n = 8 mice per group). (D) Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
  staining for menin, α‐SMA and collagen 1 in the kidney tissues of the in the kidney
  tissues of the sham and UUO mice; scale bars 50 μm. (E) Quantification of menin,
  α‐SMA and collagen 1 IHC staining in (D) (n = 8 mice per group). (F) Western blotting
  was used to detect the expression of the indicated proteins in the kidney tissues
  of the sham and UUO mice (n = 3 mice per group). (G) Western blotting was used to
  detect the expression of the indicated proteins in mouse renal tubular epithelial
  cells (mRTECs) at the indicated time points after exposure to 10‐ng/ml TGF‐β. (H)
  Representative images of menin and H3K4me3 IHC staining in kidney tissues of the
  minimal change diseases (MCD) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients; scale bars
  50 μm. The data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD); *p < .05,
  **p < .01, ***p < .001, ****p < .0001.
