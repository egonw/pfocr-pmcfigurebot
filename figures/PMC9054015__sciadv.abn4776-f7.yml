figure_title: Nonlesional skin is characterized by up-regulation of unique cellular
  and pathway signatures
caption: '(A) Hedges’ g effect sizes of cellular (left) and pathway (right) gene signatures
  for pooled nonlesional disease samples compared to pooled control samples DLE, PSO,
  and AD datasets. Heatmap visualization uses red (enriched signature, >0) and blue
  (decreased signature, <0). Welch’s t test: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  ****P < 0.0001. (B) Comparison of the most important features determined by ML that
  are also statistically significant by z-score GSVA of nonlesional skin versus controls
  for nonlesional DLE (left), nonlesional PSO (middle), and nonlesional AD (right).
  Forty signatures were used in the nonlesional z-score GSVA; only these features
  were used in the comparison to nonlesional ML.'
