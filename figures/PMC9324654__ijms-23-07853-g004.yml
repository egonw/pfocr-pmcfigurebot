caption: Stable CYP27C1-knockdown enhances colony formation ability of lung cancer
  cells. (A–D) A549-shCYP27C1, H1975-shCYP27C1, and the corresponding control cells
  were seeded in 6-well plates, respectively. Culture medium was changed in every
  3–4 days, and cell colony formation was observed. After culturing for about 14 days,
  cell colonies were stained with crystal violet, and scanned. The absorbance of eluent
  was detected at 595 nm. Results were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed T test. ***,
  p < 0.001, ****, p < 0.0001.
