caption: PrxM population includes three subclusters with distinct signatures in cell
  growth, hormone signaling and endothelial integrity. (A) Clustering of cells identified
  three subpopulations within PrxM. Cell identity was established by using significantly
  enriched genes in each subcluster. Growing ExM cells (red) express higher levels
  of oxidative phosphorylation and ribosome genes. ExM progenitors with hormone activity
  (green) exhibit higher levels of GnRH, TGF-β, PTH, and relaxin signaling pathway
  genes. Endothelial ExM progenitors (blue) are enriched in adherens junction and
  axon guidance genes. (B) Heatmap showing expression levels of selected marker genes
  in the three subclusters of PrxM. (C–G) UMAP plots of PrxM. Individual cells are
  coloured by the expression levels of key marker genes (LUM, ANXA1, PARM1, and DPP4).
  The embryonic mesoderm marker LIX1 is absent in most cells.
