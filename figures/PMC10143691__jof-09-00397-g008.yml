caption: Schematic model for the regulatory network of protein kinase PoxMKK1 in P.
  oxalicum according to the data. GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptor. A P in orange-red
  circles represents phosphorylation events. The dashed lines represent that the pathway
  needs to be further confirmed. Arrows indicate activation, whereas bars indicate
  repression.
