figure_title: The IL-6 pathway is involved in development of resistance to cediranib
  in 30200 model
caption: A. Boxplots of log2RPKM gene expression of indicated genes in omentum, 30200
  and 60577 tumors (n=4, 4,5 respectively). B. IHC for endomucin and pSTAT3 in control
  and cediranib short-term treated 30200 tumors. C. IHC for pSTAT3 in control and
  cediranib short-term treated 30200 tumors D. Intensity of pSTAT3 staining in control
  and cediranib short-term treated luminated vessels. E. Western blot analysis of
  pSTAT3, STAT3 and β-actin in MLEC treated with recombinant mIL-6, VEGF and cediranib
  F. IHC for endomucin in control and cediranib-treated 30200 tumors at survival end
  point. G. Western blot analysis of pSTAT3, STAT3, pERK, ERK and α-Tubulin in 30200
  control treated omental tumors, cediranib-treated omental and peritoneal tumors
  collected at end point.
