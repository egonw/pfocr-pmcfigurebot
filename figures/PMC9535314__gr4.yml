caption: Comparison of COVID-19 with common forms of fibrosing interstitial lung disease
  (ILD). (a) Different morphological patterns in lungs of early and late hospitalized
  COVID-19 patients compared to lungs of patients with ILD [usual interstitial pneumonia
  (UIP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), and
  alveolar fibroelastosis (AFE) lungs]. Scanning electron microscopy was performed
  using a Philips XL30 microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) at 15 keV
  and 21 Î¼A. Histopathological analysis was performed after hematoxylin and eosin
  staining. (b) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes of COVID-19 and influenza
  lung samples compared with expression in controls (COVID-19, n = 15; influenza A
  lung samples, n = 7; ILD lung samples, n = 18 (UIP, n = 6; NSIP, n = 6; AFE, n =
  6); healthy control lung samples, n = 25). (c) Functional pathway analysis highlights
  the differential functional gene expression in lung tissue of patients with COVID-19,
  ILD, and influenza A. Color indicates up- (red) and down (blue)-regulation; Circle
  size depicts the false discovery rate (FDR). Only significantly up- or down-regulated
  pathways are shown.
