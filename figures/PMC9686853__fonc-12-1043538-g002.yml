caption: Integrin α6β4 promotes activation of ATM-p53-53BP1 in response to cisplatin
  that results in enhanced DNA damage. (A) BT549 cells (EV, β4, and β4-1355T) were
  plated on laminin-1 and treated with 10μM cisplatin for 24h prior to assessing for
  phosphorylation of indicated DDR proteins, as noted. Fold differences in pATM S1981,
  p53BP1 S1778 and p-p53 S15 were quantified from three separate experiments and reported
  relative to BT549 EV control (B). (C) MDA-MB-231 control or β4 KO (clone 454-1)
  cells were treated with indicated dose of cisplatin for 24h as in (A) and immunoblotted
  for the indicated phospho-proteins and total proteins. Fold changes in noted phosphorylation
  sites are reported after normalization to total protein and reported relative to
  MDA-MB-231 control treatment in (D). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005.
