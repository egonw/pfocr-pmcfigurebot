caption: The general schematization of secondary metabolites and their biosynthetic
  gene cluster.A. Most secondary metabolites (SMs) are generated from precursors catalysed
  by backbone enzymes (e.g. polyketide synthase, non‐ribosomal synthetase and terpene
  synthase and/or cyclase) that use primary metabolites (e.g. acyl‐CoA, amino acids,
  isoprenoid) to synthesize the SM precursor (carbon backbones) (Lim and Keller, ).
  These carbon backbones are further modified by the tailoring enzymes to form the
  final active SMs.B. Fungal biosynthetic gene cluster basically consists of a backbone
  enzyme and tailoring enzymes (e.g. methyltransferases and p450 monooxygenases) (indicated
  with dotted lines) (Keller, ; Collemare and Seidl, ). The transporters are also
  found in most of the BGCs to secrete/move pathway precursors or finished product.
  Additionally, BGCs may contain a cluster‐specific transcription factor that activates
  the other genes within the BGC, resistance genes to product the producing fungus
  from its own BGC product (e.g. many are antifungal) and often genes with hypothetical
  functions (indicated with grey).
