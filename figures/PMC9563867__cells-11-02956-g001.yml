caption: Glycolysis and related pathways in GBM cells. Glucose enters GBM cells via
  GLUT1 in a manner independent of insulin. Upon entry, glucose is phosphorylated
  to glucose-6-phosphate and may be processed further in the pentose phosphate pathway
  or in glycolysis. Glycolysis feeds and communicates with the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (at the level of fructose-6-phosphate) as well as the serine/glycine pathway
  (originating from 3-phospho-glycerate). The final product of glycolysis is pyruvate,
  which may subsequently convert to lactate, resulting in regeneration of NADH to
  NAD, facilitating rapid glycolytic flux. Lactate is removed from the cell through
  either MCT1 or MCT4. Alternatively, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which in
  turn reacts to citrate. Citrate may be either processed in the TCA-cycle or used
  to give rise to cytosolic acetyl-CoA, which is used for fatty acid synthesis. HDAC
  and aurora kinase A inhibitors block glycolysis by suppression of GLUT1, hexokinase
  II, and LDHA.
