figure_title: Activation of VEGF-PI3K/AKT pathway in OGD-exposed 3D NVU was inhibited
  by SU1498 or LY294002
caption: a, c Intensity of p-AKT was decreased in catalpol (50 μM)+LY294002 group.
  b, d Vascular-like structure length was decreased in the presence of SU1498 or LY294002
  groups. e–h Effects of SU1498 on the production of VEGF downstream proteins. i–k
  Activation effects of catalpol on the production of VEGF, p-VEGFR2/VEGFR2, PI3K,
  and p-AKT/AKT were inhibited by LY294002. Scale bar = 50 μm. The data are presented
  as the mean ± S.D., n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
