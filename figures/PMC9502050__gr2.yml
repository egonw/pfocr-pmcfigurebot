caption: Establishment of whole EPO gene knockout in HEK-293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9
  gene-editing technology with paired gRNAs and whole transcriptomic profiling of
  knockouts to identify differentially expressed genes(A) Hypothetical schematic of
  the construction of the EPO−/−. Successful targeting of the paired gRNAs would result
  in the introduction of two double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and the removal of the
  intervening region from the genomic DNA (∼645 bp) after DNA repair via non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ). The location of the paired gRNAs designed to target the EPO
  gene (ENST00000252723.3) are labeled and highlighted by the red dotted lines. P1
  and P2 represent location of primers used for genotyping potential knockouts.(B)
  Immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblot analysis, probing for EPO and GAPDH as a control,
  revealed reduced EPO protein expression levels in both EPO−/− cell lines (KOA and
  KOB) compared to WT controls and cells transfected with an EPO over-expression construct
  (hEPO).(C) PCA plot illustrating the transcriptomic profiles of the EPO−/− cell
  lines compared to WT HEK-293 controls. The plot shows the results obtained from
  RNA-seq analysis of four WT samples, four KOA samples, and four KOB samples.(D)
  The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (p ≤ 0.05) obtained by performing
  differential gene expression analysis comparing WT to KOA and WT to KOB.(E) Heatmap
  illustrating the expression profile of the 3,722 overlapping DEGs. The red blocks
  represent down-regulated genes, and the blue bocks represent up-regulated genes;
  the color scale of the heatmap represents the DEG expression level.(F) qRT-PCR of
  four of the top DEGs identified by differential gene expression analysis to validate
  our RNA-seq findings. The graph shows the relative change in mRNA expression levels
  (+/− SEM) between genotypes.(G) The top ten KEGG Pathways identified through GEO
  analysis of the 3,501 overlapping with consistent direction of effects. Analysis
  was performed with Enrichr online tool. The color scale represents the log10 p value.(H)
  qRT-PCR of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway identified by differential
  gene expression analysis to determine whether EPO−/− results in altered Notch signaling
  activity. hEPO represents WT HEK-293 cells transfected with an over-expression EPO
  construct. The graph shows the relative change in mRNA expression levels (+/− SEM)
  between genotypes. Columns and error bars in (F) and (H) represent mean and SEM
  values. Paired t test was performed. ns, non-significant; ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001.
