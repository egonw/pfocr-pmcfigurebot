caption: Lung phenotypic shifts in metastatic progression. a Expression of pro-metastatic
  genes increased as disease progressed. b Inflammation scores were calculated through
  the average expression of genes in the GO_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE pathway. c ECM remodeling
  scores were calculated through the average expression of genes in the GO_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE
  pathway. Points represent outlying cells as calculated by 1.5*IQR. d Enrichment
  of signaling pathways (as determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) from
  differential gene expression between sequential time points, NES normalized enrichment
  score. e Percent of the scratch that had closed at 5 h and 24 h post-initial scratch
  when 4T1 tumor cells were exposed to conditioned medium (collected from lungs on
  days 0, 7, 14, and 21 of culture). The dotted black line represents the RPMI control.
  f Fold increase in the number of 4T1 cells over 72 h when the cells were exposed
  to conditioned medium (at t = 0 h) as measured through tdTomato fluorescence, *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
