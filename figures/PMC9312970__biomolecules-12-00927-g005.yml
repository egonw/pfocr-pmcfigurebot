caption: 'Effect of MH treatment on the cell morphology, number, HSPs and apoptosis-related
  protein expression in the AML12 cells. (A) The morphology of AML12 cells of control
  and cold groups. were observed under a microscope. (Scale bar = 50 µm). (B) MTT
  assay was used to detect the effect of MH on the growth and proliferation of AML12
  cells. (C) The protein level of HSP70, HSP90 and β-actin in each group. (D,E) Quantification
  of expression levels based on expression ratios of HSP70/β-actin and HSP90/β-actin.
  (F) Hoechst 33258 staining was used to detect the effect of MH on AML12 cell apoptosis.
  (Scale bar = 50 µm). (G) The protein level of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and β-actin
  in each group. (H,I) Quantification of expression levels based on expression ratios
  of Bax/Bcl-2, Cleaved-Caspase-3/Pro-Caspase-3. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  (n = 3). NS means not significant, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, # p < 0.05. Where
  * represents comparison with the control group corresponding to their respective
  time, and # represents comparison with MH 12 h.'
