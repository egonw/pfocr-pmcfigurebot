caption: 'TND promoted the survival of HAoECs via activating ERK and AKT pathway.
  HAoECs were treated with oxLDL (30 μg/mL) and with or without TND for an additional
  24 hours. (a) The concentrations of TND were set as 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL. The
  cytoprotective effects of TND were measured using LDH release kits. (b) The concentrations
  of TND were set as 50 μg/mL. The prosurvival pathways, ERK and AKT signaling, were
  determined by immunoblotting. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. sham; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs.
  oxLDL.'
