figure_title: BRD4 inhibition suppresses the expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 via NFAT2
caption: 'A The top 12 enriched terms of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) enrichment pathway analyses were shown in the bubble plot (DMSO + PHA VS
  DMSO). The KEGG pathways was identified by R package “clusterProfiler”, and P < 0.05
  was considered statistically significant. B Scatter plot of top 15 enriched KEGG
  pathways were shown in the bubble plot (DMSO + PHA VS JQ1 + PHA). C A heatmap of
  the expression of genes involved in the TCR signaling pathway in Jurkat cells was
  analyzed by RNA-seq. D CD8 + T cells were cultured with 100 ng/ml FK506 for 24 h
  in the presence and absence of P/I (PMA: 20 ng/L, ionomycin: 0.5 μM), NFAT2 expression
  was determined by qRT-PCR (n = 4). E PD-1 expression of CD8 + T cells treated with
  100 ng/ml FK506 for 24 h in the presence and absence of P/I was determined by FACS
  (n = 4). F PD-1 expression of CD8 + T cells treated with 100 ng/ml FK506 for 24 h
  in the presence and absence of P/I was determined by qRT-PCR (n = 4). G Jurkat cells
  were stimulated with and without PHA (150 ng/mL) after NFAT2 knockdown, then qRT-PCR
  was used to examine the expression of NFAT2 (n = 4). H PD-1 expression of Jurkat
  cells stimulated with and without PHA (150 ng/mL) after NFAT2 knockdown was determined
  by FACS (n = 3). I PD-1 expression of Jurkat cells stimulated with and without PHA
  (150 ng/mL) after NFAT2 knockdown was determined by qRT-PCR (n = 3). J Jurkat cells
  were treated with 0.5 μM JQ1 for 24 h in the presence and absence of PHA (150 ng/mL),
  and NFAT2 expression was detected by immunofluorescence. K Jurkat cells were treated
  with 0.5 μM JQ1 for 24 h in the presence and absence of PHA (150 ng/mL), and NFAT2
  expression was detected by western blot. L NFAT2 expression was examined by western
  blot after overexpressing BRD4 in Jurkat cells. Shown are the representative images
  of three separate experiments. M Jurkat cells were treated with 0.5 μM JQ1 for 24 h
  in the presence and absence of PHA (150 ng/mL), the expression of JUN was examined
  by qRT-PCR (n = 3). N JUN expression was detected by qRT-PCR after BRD4 overexpression
  in Jurkat cells (n = 3). O Chromatin samples from Jurkat cells stimulated with 150 ng/ml
  PHA for 24 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-BRD4 antibody, and enrichment of
  BRD4 at the promoter regions of NFAT2 and PDCD1 was measured by qRT-PCR (n = 3).
  P The chromatin samples were stimulated with 150 ng/ml PHA for 24 h and immunoprecipitated
  with an anti-NFAT2 antibody, enrichment of NFAT2 at the promoter regions of PDCD1
  and HAVCR2 was measured by qRT-PCR (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± SD. n = 3
  or more independent biological replicates, presented as individual points. P value
  < 0.05 was considered to be significant (D, F–I, M, O, P: one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
  post hoc test; N: two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests).'
