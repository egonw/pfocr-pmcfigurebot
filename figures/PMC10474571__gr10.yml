caption: '(A) Schematic illustration of a possible mechanism that ZS/HA/Col scaffolds
  with 10 wt% ZS activated the p38 signaling pathway in monocytes. (B) Micro-CT imaging
  of rat critical-sized cranial defects implanted with ZS/HAp/Col scaffolds containing
  different proportions of zinc silicate at 8 and 12 weeks postsurgery. No platforms
  were embedded in the blank group. The newly formed bone is indicated in yellow;
  the media is shown in gray; scale bar: 5 mm. (C) Bone volume fraction. (D) Residual
  material volume fraction. (E) Trabecular thickness (Tb. Th). (F) Trabecular number
  (Tb. N). (G–H) Statistical comparisons of BMP-2 (G) and Osterix (H) transcription
  levels in vivo two weeks after implantation. αp < 0.05 vs. 0 ZS/HA/Col scaffolds;
  βp < 0.05 vs. 5 ZS/HAp/Col scaffolds; γp < 0.05 vs. 10 ZS/HA/Col scaffolds; δp <
  0.05 vs 15 ZS/HA/Col scaffolds []. Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society.'
