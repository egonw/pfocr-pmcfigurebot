caption: miR-29a-3p suppresses tumor growth via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) Reverse transcription quantitative-PCR was used to measure the expression
  of miR-29a-3p in mice. (B) Tumor volume was measured weekly. (C and D) Tumor weight
  was determined at the end of the experiments. (E) Ki67 expression was detected using
  immunohistochemical staining (scale bar, 20 µm). (F) Western blotting was to measure
  the expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin in the tumors. BALB/c nude mice were injected
  with miR-29a-3p mimic or NC-mimic. **P<0.01 vs. control group. NC, negative control;
  NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; miR, microRNA.

  lung cancer cells by reducing the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
