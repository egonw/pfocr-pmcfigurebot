caption: Schematic of the experimental protocols. Rats were subjected to cerebral
  ischemia for 90 min and reperfusion for 24 h MNF (10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, intragastric)
  or BBR (50 mg/kg/day, intragastric) was administered once a day for consecutive
  14 days before MCAO, and 1 day after surgery. Behavioral tests were performed on
  day 1 following cerebral ischemia. MNF, magnoflorine; BBR, berberine; MCAO, middle
  cerebral artery occlusion.
