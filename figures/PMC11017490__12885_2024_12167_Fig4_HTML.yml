caption: 'Astragaloside IV-PESV can inhibit the expression of RAGE. A. qRT-PCR was
  used to detect the expression of mRNA of RAGE in each group. B. Western blot was
  used to detect the protein expression of RAGE in each group of PCa tissues. C. Western
  blot was used to detect the protein expression of inflammatory factors NF-κB, TNF-α
  and IL-6 in each group. *, P < 0.05 compared with the Control group. #, P < 0.05
  compared with the PESV group'
