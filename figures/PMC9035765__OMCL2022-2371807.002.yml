caption: Carboplatin induces pyroptosis in cells with high GSDME expression. (a) CCK-8
  assay of cell viability. (b) The death morphologies of the three cell lines were
  observed using an Olympus microscope; black arrows, apoptotic cells; white arrows,
  pyroptotic cells. (c–i) GSDME-N and pathway proteins were tested by WB in three
  different cell lines. (j and k) The FITC and PI staining rates of the three cell
  lines were determined by flow cytometry, and quantitative maps were drawn after
  treatment with carboplatin for 24 h. (l) LDH levels in the cell supernatant were
  detected by ELISA. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Scale bar,
  100 μm.
