caption: Context-dependent role of Gasdermin D (Gsdmd) in the release of IL-33 and
  IL-1β. In response to allergen protease stimulation (A), nuclear IL-33 is transported
  into the cytosol via dynamic SG assembly (1). The subsequent generation of pores
  by the newly described fragment of Gsdmd (p40 NT in mouse/p35 NT in human) (2) leads
  to the active release of IL-33 into the extracellular space, which is independent
  of the canonical inflammasome pathway that is activated in response to microbial
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS and molecules associated
  with the endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) ATP (B). Drugs targeting
  Gsdmd could be used as therapeutic agents to curb type 2 inflammation. However,
  the nature of the sensing receptor of the allergen protease and the identity of
  the enzyme that generates the p40 NT-Gsdmd need to be investigated. Figure created
