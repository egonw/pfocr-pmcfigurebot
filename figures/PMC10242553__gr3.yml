caption: CD44 promotes the migration of osteosarcoma cells. (A) Cell migration in
  CD44 overexpressing in U-2 OS cells was determined by a transwell migration assay.
  (B) Cell migration in CD44 knockdown in MG-63 cells was determined by transwell
  migration assay. (C) Cell migration in CD44 overexpressing in U-2 OS cells was also
  determined by wound healing assay. (D) Cell migration in CD44 knockdown in MG-63
  cells was determined by wound healing assay. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
  immune infiltration and affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
