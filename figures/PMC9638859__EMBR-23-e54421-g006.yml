caption: 'A Browser tracks of NANOG enrichment in Fragment Per Kilobase of transcripts
  per Million (FPKM) in Oct4+/+ cells (normal NANOG levels) and Oct4+/− cells (higher
  NANOG levels at Fgf4, Fgfbp1, Fgfr1, and Fgfr2 loci) (Data ref: Karwacki‐Neisius
  et al, ).B Histogram of FGFR1 expression on the cell surface analyzed by immunostaining
  and FACS of fixed but unpermeabilized TNERT cells treated with (red) or no OHT (blue).
  The dotted line represents the FACS profile of E14Tg2a cells stained with control
  IgG and secondary antibody used as negative control (−ve c).C Relative expression
  levels of pERK, FGFR2, and FGFR1 at indicated time points after OHT treatment in
  TNERT cells (n > 3).D ELISA‐based relative quantification of FGF4 and FGFBP1in media
  from EDiN cells cultured with or no Doxycycline (n = 3). EDiN cell was generated
  by introducing a Doxycycline inducible Flag‐Avi‐NANOG transgene in E14Tg2a cells.E
  Nanog:GFP population median of Tβc44Cre6 treated with OHT‐induced conditioned media
  collected after different time points (n = 3).F (top) Schematic of TNERTZfp281−/−
  cells, (upper‐middle) CRISPR‐based paired guide knock‐out strategy indicating the
  relative position of the sgRNAs, FP and RP indicate the genotyping primers. (Lower
  middle) Genotyping PCR indicating +/− and −/− clones. (Bottom) The sequencing chromatogram
  of the deleted region confirms the exact site of deletion, followed by RT‐qPCR analysis
  of the Zfp281 transcripts.G Nanog:GFP population median of Tβc44Cre6 treated with
  conditioned media from TNERT + OHT 0 h, TNERTFGF4−/− + OHT 48 h, Tβc44Cre6 48 h,
  E14Tg2a‐FGF4‐OE (overexpression) 48 h, TNERT + OHT 48 h and 50 ng/ml FGF4 (n = 3).H,
  I ELISA‐based relative quantities of FGF4 and FGFBP1 in media from TNERT after 18,
  24, and 48 h of OHT treatment (n = 3).J ELISA‐based relative quantities of FGF4
  in conditioned media from cell lines—TNERT + OHT 0 h, TNERTFGF4−/− + OHT 48 h, E14Tg2a‐FGF4‐OE
  48 h (overexpression), TNERT−/+OHT 48 h, and 50 ng/ml FGF4 (n = 3).K ELISA‐based
  relative quantities of FGFBP1 in conditioned media from various cell lines—TNERT + OHT
  0 h, TNERT‐Fgfbp1−/− 48 h + OHT, TNERT 48 h −/+OHT, and 50 ng/ml FGBP1 (n = 3).Data
  information: n ≥ 3 biological replicates (each dot represents a biological replicate).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM in C and D–K. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001 and ns = not significant (paired two‐tailed Student''s t‐test).'
