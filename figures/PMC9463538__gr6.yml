caption: FGFR4 promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation and maintenance of stemness in trophoblast
  stem cells.A–C, Fgfr4 transcript and protein are increased in TSKI cells relative
  to TSWT cells. A, qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative
  to TSWT cells and are the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent experiments. B,
  Western blotting images and (C) densitometry analyses with normalization of FGFR4
  to α-tubulin are shown. D, reduced Fgfr4 expression through shRNA knockdown in TSKI
  cells. qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative to
  TSKI cells and are the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent experiments. E and
  F, reduced FGFR4 protein with shRNA knockdown of Fgfr4. Data show the mean ± range
  of 2 biologically independent experiments. G and H, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is not
  consistently affected by Fgfr4 shRNA knockdown. I–N, cells were treated with either
  vehicle control (DMSO) or the indicated concentration of BLU9931. I and J, chronic
  inhibition of FGFR4 with BLU9931 for 48 h increases Akt phosphorylation. K, chronic
  BLU9931 treatment for 48 h inhibits the expression of markers of TS cell stemness.
  qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative to TSWT cells
  and are the mean ± SD of 4 (Cdx2) or 3 (Esrrb) biologically independent experiments.
  L, chronic BLU9931 treatment for 48 h reduced cellular doubling time. M and N, acute
  inhibition of FGFR4 by treatment with BLU9931 for 1 h inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
  B, G, I, and M, Western blotting images are representative of 3 biologically independent
  experiments. C, H, J, and N, densitometry analyses shown are the mean ± SD of 3
  biologically independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p <
  0.0001; Student’s t test. Akt, protein kinase B; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ERK1/2,
  extracellular-regulated kinase 2; FGFR4, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4; KI,
  kinase inactive; ns, not significant; qPCR, quantitative PCR; TS, trophoblast stem.
