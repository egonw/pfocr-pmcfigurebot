caption: Shuterin induced the Ras/Raf pathway and increased IFN-γ expression in KHYG-1
  cells and NK cells obtained from adult patients with head and neck squamous cell
  carcinoma (HNSCC). Effects of shuterin treatment (24 h) on the proteins involved
  in the Ras/Raf pathway in (A,B) KHYG-1 cells and (C,D) NK cells obtained from adult
  patients with HNSCC. ImageJ was used for protein quantification; the levels of all
  proteins were normalized to those of beta-actin. Data are presented as the mean
  ± standard deviation (n = 3). * p < 0.05 V.S. control. (E) Levels of interferon
  (IFN)-γ in shuterin-treated (24 h) NK cells that were obtained from adult patients
  with HNSCC (measured through ELISA).
