caption: Regression of the relative expression level of genes involved in the Toll
  pathway in D. citri. Dorsal-related immunity factor/Dorsal (Dif/DI), Pelle (pll),
  Tube (tub), Cactus (cact), Toll (TI), Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88),
  and Spaetzle (spz) genes expression in different developmental stages of D. citri.
  Quadratic polynomial regression analysis between Dif/DI gene expression and developmental
  stages of D. citri. Simple linear regression analysis between pll, tub, cact, TI,
  myd88, spz genes expression and D. citri developmental stages. In the linear and
  quadratic polynomial regression, dots show the raw data. The black round shapes
  indicate the raw data (n = 10). The fitted and polynomial regression line is presented
  as dashed lines. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for estimated regression is presented
  as gray-shaded and edged by dotted lines. The regression equation, RSquare (R2)
  and Rsquare Adj (R2adj), and p-value obtained after F tests are presented within
  each graph.
