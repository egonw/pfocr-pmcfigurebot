caption: 'PF suppressed MAPK signal pathway in PANC-1. (A) PF exhibited good binding
  activity to p38 as determined by molecular docking. (B) Based on the results of
  Western blot analyses, PF was shown to decrease p38-related phosphorylation in MAPK
  signaling. This image displays some typical consequences from WB banding. (C–E)
  Each protein’s relative expression level was measured using statistical methods:
  p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38. ***p < 0.001 vs. control group.'
