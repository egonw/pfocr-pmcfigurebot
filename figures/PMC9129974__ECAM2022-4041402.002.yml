caption: 'Citrus unshiu peel improved changes in body weight, colon tissue length,
  and histological analysis in UC. (a) Change body weight; (b) change in colon length;
  (c) MPO (myeloperoxidase); (d) histological analysis; (e) histological score. Hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E) staining. Blue arrows indicate inflammatory cells infiltration.
  Magnification ×100 and ×200 (scale bar = 100 μm). Histological analysis was measured
  using ImageJ program (NIH). Control: control mice, DSS: distilled water administered
  to ulcerative colitis mice, SASP: sulfasalazine 100 mg/kg body weight administered
  to ulcerative colitis mice, CUPL: CUP 100 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative
  colitis mice, and CUPH: CUP 200 mg/kg body weight administered to ulcerative colitis
  mice. Data are mean ± SD (n = 8). Significance: ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs.
  control mice, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. DSS mice.'
