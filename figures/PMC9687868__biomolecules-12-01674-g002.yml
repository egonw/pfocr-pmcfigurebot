caption: OGN signaling in fibrosis. (1) OGN reduces cardiac fibroblast proliferation
  and TGFÎ²-mediated collagen production in age-related hearts. (2) MiR-22 overexpression
  induced cellular senescence and promoted the migratory activity of cardiac fibroblasts
  by targeting OGN in the aging heart. (3) Overexpressed miR-140 inhibits pulmonary
  fibrosis in interstitial lung disease via the Wnt signaling pathway by downregulating
  OGN. (4) OGN enhances myocardial fibrosis and reverses EMT/EndMT in a mouse model
  of myocarditis. (5) OGN regulates cardiac myofibroblast proliferation and migration
  in response to AngII by suppressing EGFR signaling.
