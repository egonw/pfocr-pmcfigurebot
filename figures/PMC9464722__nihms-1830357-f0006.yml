caption: '(A) Western blot analysis probing for p62 and LC3B (autophagy pathway),
  in cortical homogenates from 8-month-old WT, AD, and CIIIKO-AD females (n=4–5/group).
  (B) relative quantification of p62/protein loading and Lc3bII/Lc3bI. (C) Western
  blot analysis probing for 20S proteasome (ubiquitin proteasome system) and CHOP
  (Integrated Stress Response) in cortical homogenates from 8-month-old WT, AD, and
  CIIIKO-AD females (n=4–5/group) and (D) relative quantifications normalized to total
  protein loading. (E) Western blot analysis probing for SOD2 and relative quantification
  normalized to total protein, in cortical homogenates from WT, AD and CIIIKO-AD females
  (n=4–5/group). (F) Quantification of carbonyl groups added to protein side chains
  as consequence of oxidative stress (Oxyblot) in cortical homogenates from AD and
  CIIIKO-AD females (n=4–5/group). (G) Representative images of coronal sections of
  AD and CIIIKO-AD females’ brains, immunostained with an anti-8OHg antibody to detect
  DNA/RNA oxidation and relative quantification. In the close-up: positive control
  (H2O2 treatment) and negative control (DNAse treatment).'
