caption: TGF-beta signaling pathway using gene set enrichment analysis algorithm (MWW
  test, p ≤ 0.05). Proteins determined by a label-free quantification (marked with
  a blue color rim) are involved in this pathway. Whereas RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 GTPases
  take part in cell migration, MTOR and RPS6KB1 participate in translation. Colored
  symbols are explained in the legend.
