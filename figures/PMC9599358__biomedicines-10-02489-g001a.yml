caption: 'c-Myc inhibition impairs pancreatic cell survival in correlation with mutp53
  downregulation. Pancreatic cell lines (PaCa44 and PT45) were treated with two different
  doses of c-Myc inhibitor (i-cMyc) for 48 h. (A) Cell survival was evaluated by trypan
  blue exclusion assay. The histograms represent the mean plus SD of live cells as
  percentage of untreated control cells, p value: * <0.05; ** <0.01; **** <0.0001;
  to evaluate cell death (B) PARP expression was evaluated by Western blot analyses.
  βActin was used as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The
  histograms represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of PARP
  cl/Act. p value: **** <0.0001; (C) p53 expression was evaluated by Western blot
  analyses. βActin was used as loading control and one representative experiment is
  shown. The histograms represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio
  of p53/Act. p value: *** <0.001; to evaluate the role of c-Myc in p53 downregulation,
  PT45 cells were transfected for 48 with cMyc silencing (si cMyc) and control siRNA-A
  (scr) as control (D) protein expression of c-Myc and p53 was evaluated by Western
  blot analyses. βActin was used as loading control and one representative experiment
  is shown. The histograms represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the
  ratio of cMyc/Act and p53/Act. p value: ** <0.01; *** <0.001; (E) Cell survival
  after 48 h of transfection was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay. The histograms
  represent the mean plus SD of live cells as percentage of control cells, p value:
  * <0.05.'
