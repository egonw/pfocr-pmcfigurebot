caption: UBE2C upregulation in PC correlates with poor survival outcomes. (A) Data
  from the GEPIA database revealed increased UBE2C expression in PC tissues relative
  to normal tissues (fold-change >1.5, P<0.05). (B) UBE2C mRNA levels were analyzed
  in 16 pairs of PC tumors and adjacent normal tissues via qPCR. Data were analyzed
  via Studentâ€™s t-tests. UBE2C mRNA (C) and protein (D) levels were analyzed in PANC1,
  Mia-capa2, and HPDE6-C7 cells. (E,F) OS and DSS in PC patients with high UBE2C expression
  in the GEPIA database were analyzed. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. GEPIA,
  Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis; PC, pancreatic cancer; OS, overall
  survival; DSS, disease-specific survival; qPCR, quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction.
