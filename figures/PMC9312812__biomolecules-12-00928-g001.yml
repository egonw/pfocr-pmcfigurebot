caption: FNIPs and Tsc1 in the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is a cellular signaling
  hub that integrates signals from several pathways and controls protein synthesis.
  A simplified schematic representation is shown to highlight the role of the FLCN/FNIPs
  and TSC complexes as mTOR regulators through GAP activity of RagA/C and Rheb, respectively.
