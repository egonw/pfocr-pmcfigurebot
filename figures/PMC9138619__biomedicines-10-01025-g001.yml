caption: KEGG-pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human cortical
  spheroids stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα or IL-1β for 4 h,
  12 h, or 36 h. (A) In each case, the top-4 KEGG pathways (based on false discovery
  rate (FDR)--corrected p-value) are shown. On the basis of this pathway analysis
  and an FDR p-value cut-off of 10−11, we selected the three most frequent (core)
  KEGG pathways for further analysis, namely “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”
  (Cyto; ko04060), “TNF signaling pathway” (TNF; ko04668) and “NF-kappa B signaling
  pathway” (NFκB; ko04065). (B) Degrees of overlap between the DEGs from the three
  selected core KEGG pathways.
