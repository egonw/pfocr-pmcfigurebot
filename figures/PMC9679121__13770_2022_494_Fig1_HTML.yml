  B Representative micrographs of HE-stained callus of MBD and MDO. The callus from
  the MDO group consisted of larger quantities of organized dense fibrous tissue oriented
  in the same direction of distraction force, whereas cluttered fibrous tissue and
  considerable inflammatory cells were contained in the callus of MBD group. Scale
