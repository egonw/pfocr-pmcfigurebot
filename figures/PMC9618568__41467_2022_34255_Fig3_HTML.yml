figure_title: Activation of proinflammatory, profibrotic pathways in ADPKD kidneys
caption: a Heatmap showing enrichment of hallmark genesets of the Molecular Signatures
  Database (MsigDB) in each cell type of ADPKD or control kidneys. Source data are
  provided as a Source Data file. b UMAP displaying enrichment of genes regulated
  by NF-κB pathway in response to TNFα (upper), genes upregulated by IL6 via STAT3
  (middle) or genes upregulated in response to TGFβ signaling (lower) in snRNA-seq
  dataset. c–e UMAP displaying enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs in
  control or ADPKD kidneys (left) and violin plot showing the relative motif enrichment
  scores in each cell type (right) for RELA (c), STAT3 (d), or SMAD2/SMAD3/SMAD4 complex
  (e). The color scale represents a normalized log-fold-change (LFC).
