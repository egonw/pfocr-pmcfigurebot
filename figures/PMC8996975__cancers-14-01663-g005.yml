caption: 'Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the differentially expressed genes
  between lung cancer bronchial epithelium (n = 55) in GSE29013 and healthy bronchial
  epithelium (n = 37) in GSE64913. (A) Notch signaling pathway, (B) cytokine production,
  (C) wound healing, (D) negative regulation of cell death (left panel shows the distribution
  of notch signaling pathway, cytokine production, wound healing, negative regulation
  of cell death according to their rank position. The right panel shows a heatmap
  illustration of their expression between lung cancer and healthy control). (E) The
  top enriched pathways, whether upregulated or downregulated in lung cancer, compared
  to healthy controls using metascape (http://metascape.org last access date 15 January
  2022): a gene annotation and analysis online resource that generates a graphical
  representation3.2.'
