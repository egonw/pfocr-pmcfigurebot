caption: PREPL modulates the distribution of dense-core vesicle structures, increasing
  the distribution of adaptor protein-1 (AP-1). (A, left panels) N2A cells and cells
  with PREPL knockdown grown in 10 cm2 dishes were imaged as described in Materials
  and Methods. Representative image shows that PREPL knockdown alters the morphology
  of N2A cells. (A, right panels) Representative bright-field microscopy images at
  40× magnification showing changes in the vesicle compartment of N2A shPREPL compared
  with N2A control cells. (B) Schematic of subcellular compartments and proteins related
  to protein processing and secretion. (C) Representative confocal microscopy images
  (100×) of live N2A (labeled with green CMFDA dye) and of N2A shPREPL (expressing
  GFP fluorescence) cells, where intracellular membranes were labeled with a cytoplasmic
  membrane dye (red), show that PREPL knockdown alters the size and number of intracellular
  vesicles. (D, left panel) Distribution of AP-1 in N2A control and N2A shPREPL cells
  using high throughput microscopy. Each dot represents a counted cell. Welch’s t
  test, ****P < 0.0001. (D, middle and right panels) Representative western blot (original
  in Supplemental Fig. 4) and quantification showing that two different shPREPL constructs
  (shPREPL A and shPREPL D) cause an increase in AP-1 protein levels and that PREPL
  expression in knockdown cells rescues wild-type phenotype. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ns = not significant.
