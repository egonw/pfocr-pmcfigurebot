caption: 'The Nrf2 signaling pathway was stimulated by treatments with TPE and TPB
  in OGD/R-injured BV2 microglial cells. (A) TPE and TPB treatments prompted the nucleus
  transportation of Nrf2 after OGD/R. (B) Relative protein values were normalized
  to those of the control group using a histogram. (C) Representative photomicrographs
  of BV2 microglial cells stained using Nrf2 and Hoechst as observed under a fluorescence
  microscope are shown. ## p < 0.01 vs. control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  OGD/R group.'
