  in vivo. (A and E) Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis for COX-2
  of decalcified bone sections. (B and F) Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative
  analysis for iNOS of decalcified bone sections. (C and G) Immunohistochemical staining
  and quantitative analysis for ARG1 of decalcified bone sections. (D and H) Immunohistochemical
