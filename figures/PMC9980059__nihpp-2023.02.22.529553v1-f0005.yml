caption: (A) Crystal structures of Sp-STING1 in complex with 2′3′-cGAMP and Sp-STING3
  in complex with 3′3′-cGAMP. The Sp-STING1–2′3′-cGAMP and Sp-STING3–3′3′-cGAMP structures
  adopt a tightly closed conformation with an ordered β-strand lid most similar to
  the human STING–2′3′-cGAMP complex, supporting high-affinity recognition of an endogenous
  cGLR nucleotide second messenger signal.(B) Sequence alignment of Sp-STING receptors
  with STING proteins from representative animal species and the bacterium S. faecium
  reveals that Sp-STING3 has unique substitutions at key residues involved in cyclic
  dinucleotide binding.(C,D) Structural comparison of the bacterial Sf-STING–3′3′-cGG
  complex, Sp-STING3–3′3′-cGAMP complex, Sp-STING1–2′3′-cGAMP complex and human STING–2′3′-cGAMP
  complex reveals critical difference in phosphodiester linker recognition that explain
  specificity for 2′3′-linked and 3′3′-linked cGLR nucleotide second messenger signals.(E)
  Model of cGLR signaling pathway in animal immunity. Animals encode multiple cGLRs
  that recognize diverse PAMPs and produce distinct nucleotide second messengers.
  STING receptor duplication and cyclic dinucleotide-specific adaptations enables
  creation of complex cGLR-STING signaling networks.
