caption: 'Schematic of the THP1‐MeWo co‐culture VZV infection system. See text for
  details.A panel of THP1 knockout cell lines was mock infected or infected with VZV
  as shown in (A). The mRNA expression levels of IFNB1 (encodes IFNβ) and IFI44 were
  analysed by RT–qPCR. Expression levels were normalised to GAPDH and are shown as
  fold changes relative to levels in uninfected cells.Cells infected as in (A) were
  analysed by western blot using the indicated antibodies.Levels of CXCL10 (IP‐10)
  in co‐culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA.WT THP1 cells infected as in
  (A) were analysed by flow cytometry. Left and right panels show gating strategy
  for (F) and (G), respectively.Quantification of inoculum (MeWo) and target cells
  (THP1) in co‐culture experiments.Quantification of VZV‐infected cells within THP1
  target cell population. Data information: The different shapes of data points in
  (B) and (D) correspond to independent biological repeat experiments. Panels (B),
  (D), (F), and (G) show pooled data from six (THP1 WT, MeWo) or three (THP1 KOs)
  independent biological repeats (n = 3/6 ± SEM). Panel (C) shows a representative
  result of three independent repeats. Panel (E) shows a representative result of
  six independent repeats. Statistical analysis in panel (B) was one‐way ANOVA with
  Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, ns = not significant.'
