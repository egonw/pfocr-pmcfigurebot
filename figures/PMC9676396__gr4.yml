caption: UBXN7 inhibits NF-κB signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of IκB
  kinase β (IKK-β). (A) UBXN7 inhibits NF-κB–dependent luciferase reporter activity.
  Huh7 cells were co-transfected with NF-κB–responsive promoter NF-κB-Luc, FLAG-UBXN7,
  and control vector or pHBV1.3 plasmids, and the cells were subjected to luciferase
  assay as a measure of relative NF-κB activity. (B and C) IKK-β interacts with UBXN7.
  (B) Huh7 cells were co-transfected with MYC-UBXN7 and FLAG-IκBα/P65/TAK1/IKK-α/IKK-β
  plasmids as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared for co-immunoprecipitation with
  anti-FLAG antibody and Western blot with indicated antibodies. Note that only IKK-β
  binded with UBXN7. (C) Immunoprecipitation of UBXN7 confirms its binding to IKK-β.
  Huh7 cells were co-transfected with MYC-IKK-β and Flag-UBXN7. Cell lysates were
  prepared for co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. (D) Overexpression
  of UBXN7 inhibits HBV-induced NF-κB signaling. Huh7 cells were co-transfected with
  pHBV1.3 plasmids and control vector or FLAG-UBXN7 plasmids as indicated (left).
  HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with control vector or FLAG-UBXN7 plasmids as
  indicated (right). Levels of proteins were examined by Western blot analysis. Note
  reduction of P-IκBα by UBXN7, suggesting an inhibition of NF-κB signaling. (E) Knockdown
  of UBXN7 enhances HBV-induced NF-κB signaling. Huh7 cells were co-transfected with
  pHBV1.3 plasmids and control oligo or siUBXN7 oligo, and levels of proteins were
  examined by Western blot analysis. (Three independent experiments were performed,
  and representative data are shown. ∗P < .05, ∗∗∗P < .001 in A).
