caption: As in , the key residues are labeled in (B), and the two paths, plus the
  crossover, can be seen by following the colored residues. The color code is the
  same, and the arrows again indicate the position of the two mobile protons (in (A)
  R326 is indicated; that residue is always protonated, but is indicated here as well).
  Rotation from (A) to (B) is as in . This is one of the two low energy configurations,
  so this arrangement is considered to be part of the actual pathway.
