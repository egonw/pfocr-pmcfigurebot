caption: 'Gene expression changes in breast cancer cells (EVSA-T) treated with THC.
  (A). Cells were treated with 3 µM or 5 µM THC for 8 h or 24 h. Genes which were
  modified irrespective of time or concentration are shown (Series GSE8502 n = 4).
  Gene expression was assayed using Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO)
  Oncochip containing 6386 genes. IPA (Qiagen) was used to create a network of known
  interactions between the differentially expressed genes. (B). Functional gene ontology
  classification of genes shown in (A) according to their gene ontology “Pathway”
  or (C) “Protein class” terms (pantherdb.org). # = number.'
