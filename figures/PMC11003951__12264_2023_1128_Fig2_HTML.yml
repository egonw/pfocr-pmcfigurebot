caption: 'The Grin2c-mediated Ca2+signaling pathway is inhibited in astrocytes after
  SCI through bioinformatics analysis. A Dot plot showing the results of KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis on differentially-expressed genes of astrocytes after SCI (inclusion
  criteria: P-value cut-off ≤0.05, q-value cut-off ≤0.05), which indicates that the
  Ca2+signaling pathways of astrocytes are significantly altered after SCI. B Diagram
  showing the various components of the astrocyte Ca2+signaling pathway after SCI.
  Ca2+ channel receptors regulate intracellular Ca2+ and downstream CaMK to adjust
  cellular proliferation. C Heat map showing the change of components in the Ca2+signaling
  pathway in astrocytes, and Grin2c and downstream Camk2b expression levels decrease
  after SCI.'
