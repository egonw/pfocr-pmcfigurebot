caption: 'IFI35 plays an important role in tumor growth in an immune-dependent way.
  A Western blot analysis of MC38 and CT26 cells transfected with plasmid harboring
  mIFI35, pCDH-mIFI35 or shRNA targeting mIFI35, pLKO-mIFI35 plasmids with IFI35 antibody.
  B–I Effect of IFI35 on murine colorectal tumor growth rate and tumor weight. B,
  C The tumor size and tumor weight of C57BL/6 mice injected subcutaneously with vector
  control and IFI35-overexpressing MC38 cell line. n = 7 mice for both groups. D,
  E The tumor size and tumor weight of C57BL/6 mice bearing scramble and sh-IFI35
  expressing MC38 cells. n = 9 mice for both groups. F, G The tumor size and tumor
  weight of vector control and IFI35-overexpressing CT26 cell line in Balb/c mice.
  n = 6 mice for both groups. H, I Tumor growth in syngeneic wild-type mice bearing
  scramble and sh-IFI35 expressing CT26 cells. n = 7 mice for both groups. Values
  are represented as mean ± SD. P values calculated by two-way ANOVA in B, D, F, H.
  Tumor weight was determined by two tailed t-tests in C, E, G, I. **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0005,
  ****P < 0.0001. J–M Cell growth of IFI35-knockdown or IFI35-overexpressing MC38
  (J, K) and CT26 (L, M) cells in vitro. n = 3. Values are represented as mean ± SD.
  Two-way ANOVA, ns: not significant. N, O Growth rate (N) and endpoint tumor weight
  (O) of vector control and IFI35Kd CT26 tumors. In each case, about 2 × 105 tumor
  cells were injected subcutaneously and observed for tumor formation in nude mice.
  n = 6 mice for each group. Values are represented as mean ± SD. P values calculated
  by two-way ANOVA in N and by two tailed t-tests in O, ns not significant'
