caption: 'Myriocin inhibits oxidative damage induced by erastin or glutamate treatmentHT22
  cells were pre-treated with or without myriocin (0.5 μM) or DHS (1 μM) for 36 h
  before incubating with or without erastin (1 μM) or glutamate (15 mM) for 24 h.(A)
  Intracellular glutathione levels of cells treated as indicated.(B) Lipid peroxidation
  of cells treated as indicated and monitored by flow cytometry after labeling with
  C11-BODIPY 581/591, fluorescence intensity was measured on the FITC channel (left
  two panels: distributions of fluorescence, right panel: relative quantification
  of fluorescence enhancement which represents the extent of probe oxidation).(C)
  Intracellular ROS production of cells treated as indicated and visualized by using
  the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA, scale bar: 50 μm. Bar graph shows the quantification
  of fluorescence intensity relative to the relevant untreated control.(D and E) Relative
  level of labile iron pool (LIP) in cells treated as indicated and monitored by the
  calcein fluorescence quenching method. For the above, error bars represent the mean ±
  SD (n = 3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).'
