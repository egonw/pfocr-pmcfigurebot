caption: a The mRNA levels of Wnt/β-catenin target genes in KOIEC crypts compared
  with WT control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. b The protein
  level of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was determined by Western blot in SIs organoids from
  KOIEC and WT mice (Left), Tg and Con (Right). c The representative images in bright
  field (Upper) and Ki67 staining (Lower) of KOIEC intestinal organoids with or without
  3 μM CHIR99021 treatment compared with the WT. The scale bar is 100 μm (Upper) and
  15 μm (Lower). d The protein level of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was determined by Western
  blot in SIs organoids from KOIEC mice with or without 3μM CHIR99021 treatment. e
  The mRNA levels of Wnt/β-catenin target genes in KOIEC and WT intestinal organoids
  with or without treatment with CHIR99021 (0.5 μM or 3 μM). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001, ns, no significance. f The representative images in bright field
  of Tg intestinal organoids with or without treatment of 3 μM IWP-2 compared with
  Con. The scale bar is 400 µm. g The mRNA levels of Wnt/β-catenin target genes in
  Tg intestinal organoids with or without 3 μM IWP-2 treatment compared with Con.
  *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Error bars represent standard errors in
  the figure.
