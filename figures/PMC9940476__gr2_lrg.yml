caption: (a). Cell viability detected in mouse fibroblast cells (NCTC clone 929) in
  the presence of different concentrations (g/L) of BS1, BS2, BS3, BS4, and BS5, compared
  to the positive control (phenol) and negative control (DMEM, 0â€‰g/L biosurfactants).
  (b) Theoretical interactions between biosurfactant molecules and bacterial cells.
  Primary mechanisms; disruption of cell membrane and proteins responsible for the
  essential function. (c). Impact of micronutrient deficiency on plant growth and
  soil quality on a micronutrient-deficient soil. Mechanisms of biosurfactant application
  enhancing micronutrient availability in micronutrient-deficient soil to the plant,
  soil quality, and related water quality through increasing nutrient solubility at
  a fixed concentration of biosurfactant molecule. C.M.C. at which there is a sudden
  increase in metal solubility in the system. (d). Biosynthetic pathway of lipopeptide
  surfactin through non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) including surfactin
  synthetase complex with four enzymatic subunits including SrfA-A, SrfA-B, and SrfA-C.
