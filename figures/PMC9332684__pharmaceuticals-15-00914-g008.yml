caption: 'Effect of montelukast on kidneys in a pre-eclampsia model in rats. Photomicrographs
  of the renal cortex of the control (A) and the Mont (B) groups displaying normal
  organization of the renal cortex. Notice the glomerular capillary tufts (g) and
  Bowman’s space (s). PCTs (p) have a narrow lumen and a highly acidophilic cytoplasm.
  DCTs (d) have a wider lumen and less acidophilic cytoplasm with vesicular nuclei
  (arrow). (C1,C2) The L-NAME group showing disturbed lobular architecture with dilated
  interlobular arteries (a). Notice the atrophic glomerulus (g), dilated PCTs (p),
  DCTs (d), and the numerous apoptotic cells (arrows) lining the tubules. Inflammatory
  cell infiltration is also detected (circle). (D) The Mont + L-NAME group showing
  the restoration of normal architecture. The renal tissue approaches the normal structure.
  H&E × 400. (E1–E3) The histopathological changes in renal tissue in all groups.
  The data are mean ± SEM (8 rats/group). (a) Significant (p < 0.05) difference from
  the control group. (b) Significant (p < 0.05) difference from the Mont group. (c)
  Significant (p < 0.05) difference from the L-NAME group. [Mont: montelukast; L-NAME:
  L-NG-Nitro arginine methyl ester.] H&E × 400, scale bare = 50 µm.'
