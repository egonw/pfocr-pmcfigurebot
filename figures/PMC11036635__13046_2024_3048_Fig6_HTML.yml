caption: 'miR-4732-3p targets 3''UTR of MFSD12 in NSCLC cells. A Volcano plot presenting
  significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (|log2FC|>1 and p < 0.05) between
  two groups: H460 cells transfected with miR-4732-3p mimics and miR-NC. B qRT-PCR
  analysis of MFSD12 mRNA expression in NSCLC cells following transfection of miR-4732-3p
  mimics and inhibitors. C Predicted binding sites between miR-4732-3p and the 3''UTR
  of MFSD12 mRNA. D Luciferase assay performed in 293T cells to validate the binding
  interaction between miR-4732-3p and MFSD12. E CCK8 assays examining the proliferation
  of NSCLC cells with overexpression or suppression of miR-4732-3p and MFSD12. F-G Western
  blot analysis of MFSD12 protein and the AKT/p21 signaling pathway in NSCLC cells
  after treatment as described above (F), and in xenograft tumors with miR-4732-3p
  overexpression (G). H-I Cell cycle analysis performed to assess the combined effects
  of miR-4732-3p and MFSD12 in NSCLC cells. J Western blot analysis conducted to investigate
  the AKT/p21 signaling pathway and G2/M phase-related protein after the indicated
  treatment. Data are shown as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments.
