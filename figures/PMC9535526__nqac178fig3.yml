caption: Dietary diversity–related microbial species, functional pathways, and fecal
  metabolites in Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants. (A) Distribution
  of identified microbial species between the baseline or stable high DDS and low
  DDS groups. (B) Enriched metagenomic functional pathways in the stable DDS groups
  and the bacterial species (contribution percentage > 10%) contributing to each pathway.
  (C) Concentrations (z score) of fecal metabolites in the stable DDS groups (n = 308).
  (A) The species were identified by 2 steps. First, we used linear discriminant analysis
  effect size to screen for discrepant species. Second, we used linear and logistic
  regression to further assess the association of each total DDS with the relative
  abundance and prevalence of the microbial taxa identified in the first step, respectively.
  (B) We performed a linear regression analysis to estimate the associations between
  the total DDS and the microbial functional pathways. (C) We used linear regression
  models to identify the associations between the DDS and specific fecal metabolites.
  n = 620 for the high baseline DDS group, n = 528 for the low baseline DDS group,
  n = 154 for the stable high DDS group, and n = 192 for the stable low DDS group.
  (A) *P < 0.05 for either linear or logistic regression. (C) *P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.25.
