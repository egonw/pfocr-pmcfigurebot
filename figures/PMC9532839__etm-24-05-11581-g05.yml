caption: VEGFA is implicated in the miR-203a-3p-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling inhibition
  in HemECs. (A) Detection of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation by western blot analysis
  after miR-203-3p and VEGFA co-transfection. (B) Semi-quantification of p-PI3K/PI3K
  and p-AKT/AKT ratios among the different groups after miR-203-3p and VEGFA co-transfection.
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; miR-203a-3p, microRNA-203a-3p;
  p-, phosphorylated; HemECs, human hemangioma endothelial cells.
article_title: MicroRNA‑203a‑3p suppresses endothelial cell proliferation and invasion,
  and promotes apoptosis in hemangioma by inactivating the VEGF‑mediated PI3K/AKT
  pathway.
