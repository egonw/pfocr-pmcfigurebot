caption: NOVA2 reversed the suppressive effect of miR‐1253 on LC cell progression.
  A549 and H1299 cells were transfected with miR‐NC, miR‐1253, miR‐1253 + pcDNA, or
  miR‐1253 + NOVA2. (A) The protein expression of NOVA2 was detected by WB analysis.
  MTT assay (b), (c), colony formation assay (d), flow cytometry (e), and transwell
  assay (f), (g) were performed to determine the viability, colony number, apoptosis,
  migration and invasion of cells. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. NOVA2,
  neuro‐oncological ventral antigen 2; LC, lung cancer; WB, western blot
article_title: Circ‐EIF3I facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung
  cancer via regulating the activity of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway through the miR‐1253/NOVA2
  axis.
