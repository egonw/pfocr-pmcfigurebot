figure_title: Key pathway members of noncanonical NF-κB signaling are up-regulated
  in NPC
caption: (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes comparing NPC tumors (n
  = 54 tumors) and normal nasopharyngeal epithelium (n = 5 controls), with key members
  of the NF-κB pathway highlighted. (B) Gene expression of key members of canonical
  and noncanonical NF-κB signaling (n = 171 libraries). (C) Heatmap based on fold
  change expression of key mediators of the NF-κB signaling pathway in NPC tumors
  compared to normal nasopharyngeal epithelium, with significant differentially expressed
  genes highlighted in bold.
article_title: The microdissected gene expression landscape of nasopharyngeal cancer
  reveals vulnerabilities in FGF and noncanonical NF-κB signaling.
