caption: Mitochondrial quality control pathways in healthy cells and CSE treated cells.
  (A). Mitochondrial biogenesis and network regulation rely on key transcription factors
  and various proteins to maintain the processes needed for the organelle’s homeostasis.
  Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) acts on mtDNA after being imported into
  mitochondria and is an essential transcription factor needed to encode mitochondrial
  proteins. The first of these proteins transcribed include electron transport chain
  subunits to increase and maintain the appropriate number of mitochondria to sustain
  oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. Secondly, fusion proteins (MFN, MFN2, and
  OPA1) and fission proteins (Drp1 and FIS1) are transcribed to maintain healthy morphology
  by excising and clearing out damaged portions of the organelle. Mitophagy, a specialized
  autophagic pathway, eventually recycles the discarded mitochondrial components [].
  (B). In human airway smooth muscle, CS disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis by causing
  morphological changes and dysfunction. CS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and
  damage to networked morphology occurs in a concentration-dependent fashion. CS also
  increased Drp1 expression, decreased Mfn2, and involved ROS. Furthermore, NF-κB
  and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) lead to a transcriptional upregulation
  and increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and protein kinase C (PKC) [].
