caption: Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with distinct
  KRT19 expression in BRCA. (A). DEGs associated with KRT19 in BRCA. Red dots represent
  upregulated 85 genes; blue dots represent downregulated 507 genes (B). Heatmap of
  the correlation between representative DEGs and KRT19. KRT13, FAM25A, SPANXB1, CHGB,
  SMR3A, SMR3B, LALBA, and CSN2 were significantly correlated with KRT19. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001. (C). Biological process results of KRT19-associated DEGs. Red dots
  represent upregulated genes and blue dots represent downregulated genes. Blue rectangles
  suggest a negative correlation, and red rectangles the opposite. (D). KEGG pathway
  results of KRT19-associated DEGs. (E). The GESA results suggest that KRT19-related
  DEGs were enriched in the early estrogen response and late estrogen response pathways.
