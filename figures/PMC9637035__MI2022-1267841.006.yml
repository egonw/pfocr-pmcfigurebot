caption: Effects of PQQ treatment on the pSTAT1, pSTAT3, pSTAT4, and pSTAT6 signaling
  pathways in lung tissue and T cells. The phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and
  STAT6 levels in lung tissue (a–d), in T cells (M-P), and STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and
  STAT6 levels in lung tissue (e–h) and in T cells (Q-T), which are presented as the
  geometric mean fluorescent intensity (GMFI) values measured by flow cytometry (colored
  lines). The gray peak is the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the blank
  control. The quantitative analysis of the phosphorylated and total STAT proteins
  in mouse lung tissue (i–l) and in T cells (u–x). The columns and error bars represent
  the means and SEMs (n = 3 − 5 per group). ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗P < 0.05. Similar results
  were obtained in at least three independent experiments.
