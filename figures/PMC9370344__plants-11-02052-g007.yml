caption: Plant hormone signal transduction pathway after 1 day of waterlogging stress.
  (A) The number of hormone-signal-related DEGs changes in bananas under waterlogging
  stress. The DEGs were involved in (B) the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and (C)
  carbon metabolism. The yellow box highlights the glycolysis pathway, leading to
  the ethanol fermentation in the purple box, and lastly, the blue box contains genes
  involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The arrows indicate activation of
  the gene, while the blunt end represents inhibition of the gene. The red cross indicates
  the inactivity of the EIN3 pathway that leads to the activation of ERF TFs. The
  numbers in parentheses correspond to the number of upregulated (red) and downregulated
  genes (blue). [ABA, abscisic acid; ACCO, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase;
  ACCS, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase; ACLY, ATP citrate (pro-S)-lyase;
  ACO, aconitate hydratase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  Aldo, aldolase; BR, brassinosteroid; CTR1, constitutive triple response 1; EBF,
  ethylene binding factor; ET, ethylene; EIN2/3, ethylene insensitive 2/3; Enol, enolase;
  IAA, auxin; FH, fumarate dehydrogenase; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  HK, hexokinase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; JA, jasmonic acid; LSC1/2, succinate-CoA
  ligase; ME, malate dehydrogenase; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; PK, pyruvate kinase; SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine;
  SDHB, succinate dehydrogenase; ST, succinyl transferase; sucB, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase].
