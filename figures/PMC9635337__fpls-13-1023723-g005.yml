caption: TEM micrographs of lateral root tip cells of 7-day wild-type (A) and osaux1-3
  (D) mutant under control condition, 200 µM CdCl2(B, E), and 200 µM CdCl2 with B.
  cereus inoculated (C, F). (A) Root tip cells of Dongjin as a wild-type cultivar
  and (D) osaux1-3 mutant under control (CK) show well-developed cell wall (CW), oval-shaped
  and clear mitochondria (M), starch grain (SG), plastids (P), nucleus (N), nuclear
  membrane (NM), and nucleolus (Nue). TEM micrographs of root tip cells of (B) wild-type
  and (E) osaux1-3 under 200 µM Cd show immature nucleus (N), plastids (P), and scattered
  nucleolus (Nue) and a discontinue cell wall (CW). TEM micrographs of root tip cells
  of (C) wild-type and (F) osaux1-3 under combined 200 µM Cd and bacterial treatment
  show well-developed cell wall (CW) and nucleus (N) along with a recovered nucleolus
  (Nue).

  in rice by interacting with the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gene, promoting
  root hair development under cadmium stress.
