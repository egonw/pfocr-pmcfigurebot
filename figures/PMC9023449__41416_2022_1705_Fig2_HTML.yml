figure_title: Comparison of features between the immune and non-immune group
caption: 'a Volcano plot showing significantly differentially expressed xCell signatures.
  The x‐axis highlights the fold changes (log2 scale) (downregulated genes, negative
  values), whereas the y‐axis indicates the level of statistical significance (shown
  in −log10 format). Red and blue colours indicate up- and downregulated signatures,
  respectively. b Comparison of expression levels of immune-related genes including
  CD4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T cell 1/cytotoxic T cell 1 [TH1/TC1],
  TH17, regulatory T cells (Treg), proinflammation, metabolism, and checkpoint between
  immune and non-immune group. The graphs display values for each patients, and statistically
  significant differences between two groups using the Wilcox test. c A representative
  gene set enrichment analysis plot showing the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
  signalling pathway in the immune versus non-immune samples. d Pre-ranked Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) using ‘Hallmark’ gene sets showed enrichment of pathways.
  Normalised enrichment scores (NES) for signature gene sets representing RNA-seq
  data from protein coding genes of immune group or non-immune group. Abbreviations:
  ns= non-significant.'
