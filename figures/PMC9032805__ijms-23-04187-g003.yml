caption: Bioinformatic analysis of networks with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).
  The analysis reports annotated interactions between genes modulated by Crenigacestat
  treatment in the HuCCT1-xenograft mouse model. The top-ranked network showing a
  high degree of interconnectivity between genes and the IPA functional category of
  this network was cancer, cell morphology, and tissue development. The Figure shows
  that Crenigacestat downregulated key Notch signaling genes, confirming the specificity
  of the treatment. Up- (red) and down- (green) regulated genes are indicated.
