caption: 'Sex‐biased immune checkpoint genes and immune function pathways across 19
  cancer types: BLCA (119 male and 51 female patients), COAD (91 male and 71 female
  patients), DLBC (16 male and 20 female patients), GMB (36 male and 11 female patients),
  HNSC (297 male and 111 female patients), KIRC (154 male and 76 female patients),
  KIRP (83 male and 29 female patients), LAML (27 male and 28 female patients), LGG
  (55 male and 40 female patients), LIHC (29 male and 18 female patients), LUAD (190
  male and 228 female patients), LUSC (309 male and 110 female patients), PAAD (46
  male and 40 female patients), READ (21 male and 17 female patients), SARC (68 male
  and 71 female patients), SKCM (10 male and 12 female patients), STAD (144 male and
  83 female patients), THCA (29 male and 77 female patients), THYM (47 male and 44
  female patients). (A) Heatmaps of immune checkpoint genes for each cancer type.
  Differential expression extents (t‐scores) of genes between male and female patients
  are calculated by t‐test, and female‐biased and male‐biased genes are shown in red
  and blue, respectively. Boxes highlight the statistically significant immune checkpoint
  genes (FDR < 0.25). (B) Heatmaps of immune function pathways for each cancer type.
  Sex‐biased immune function pathways are identified by GSEA based on the sex‐biased
  gene ranks of mRNA expression for each cancer type, and normalized enrichment score
  (ES) for each pathway is also calculated by GSEA. Female‐biased and male‐biased
  pathways are shown in red and blue, respectively. Boxes highlight the statistically
  significant enriched pathways (FDR < 0.25).'
