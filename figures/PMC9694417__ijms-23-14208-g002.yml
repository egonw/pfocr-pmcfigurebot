caption: DEGs induced by TDZ (TDZ vs. control) in cotton AZs under different temperatures.
  (A) The numbers of DEGs in cotton AZs induced by TDZ. N-24 h, 24 h after treatment
  at normal temperature (25 °C). L-24 and L-144 h, 24 and 144 h, respectively, after
  treatment at low temperature (15 °C). The DEGs are controlled by q-value < 0.05
  and |log2FC| ≥ 1. FC represents the expression-level fold change of genes. Black
  digits indicate the gene numbers; (B) enriched biological process GO terms (FDR
  (false discovery rate) < 0.001,). X-axis shows numbers of DEGs and Y-axis shows
  the top ten enriched GO terms of DEGs induced by TDZ at N-24 h; (C) enriched KEGG
  pathways (FDR < 0.05). X-axis shows numbers of DEGs and Y-axis shows the top-ten
  enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs induced by TDZ at N-24 h; (D) the numbers of plant
  signaling genes in cotton AZs regulated by TDZ; (E,F) Venn diagram displaying the
  number of DEGs unique to each time point or overlapping between different time points
  in AZs treated with TDZ compared with control. Upregulated DEGs (E). Downregulated
  DEGs (F). Black digits indicate the gene numbers. The percentage shows the proportion
  of DEGs of each part in all DEGs at three time points.
