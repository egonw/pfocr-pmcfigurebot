caption: The significantly differentially expressed genes and proteins of cell adhesion
  molecules signaling pathway in chick kidneys. (A) Cell adhesion molecules signaling
  pathway diagram. (B) Heat maps of 9 significantly differentially expressed genes.
  (C) The mRNA relative expression levels of CD28, ICOS, BLB1, BLB2, DMB2, CLDN8,
  CLDN18, CLDN19, and NEGR1 gene. (D) Heat maps of 3 significantly differentially
  expressed proteins. (E) The expression levels of CD28, ICOS, and CLDN8 protein.
  (KA represents the control group, and KB represents the FFC treatment group. Compared
  with the control group, * means P < 0.05, ** means P < 0.01.)
