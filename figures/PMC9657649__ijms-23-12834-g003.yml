caption: Ethylene confers chilling tolerance in cucumber. (A,B) Heat maps of the expression
  levels of genes belonging to “response to ethylene” (A) and “ethylene-activated
  signaling pathway” (B). Chilling-induced expression changes are shown, expressed
  as log2FC based on RNA-seq data. (C,D) Relative expression levels of ACS2 (C) and
  ACO2 (D) in 16 days old seedlings of CC and R1461 under chilling stress. Expression
  at 0 h was set to a value of 1. Data are the means ± SD of three biological replicates
  consisting of 3–6 individual seedlings each. ** means p < 0.01, Student’s t-test.
  (E) Survival rates of CC and R1461 under 4 days of chilling treatment and 7 days
  of recovery with 100 µM ACC, water, and 100 µM AgNO3 treatment. Data are the means
  ± SD of three biological replicates consisting of 30 seedlings each. Different letters
  above the bars indicate significant differences among samples, as determined by
  one-way ANOVA/Duncan (p < 0.05).
