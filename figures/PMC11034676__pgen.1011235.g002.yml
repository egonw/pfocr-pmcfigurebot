figure_title: The strongest communication between different subgroups is through the
  SPP1 pathway
caption: (A) Pie chart showing the percentage distribution of different signaling
  pathways. (B) Line graph showing the intercellular action of the SPP1 pathway. (C)
  Contribution of different receptors of SPP1 action. (D) SPP1 action with receptor
  CD44, ITGA8 and ITGB1, ITGA4 and ITGB1, ITGA5 and ITGB1, ITGAV and ITGB5. (E) Expression
  of different receptors in different subpopulations. (F) Human SPP1 levels in M0,
  tumor cells and TAM were detected by ELISA. (G) Human TGF β, IL10 and VEGF levels
  in MDA-MB 231 (231)-induced TAM treated by rh SPP1 protein and anti-SPP1 antibody
  were detected by ELISA. Data were shown as mean ± SD and are representative of three
  independent experiments. P values were calculated using the 2-tailed 2-sample t
  test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
