figure_title: Didymin pretreatment reduces OGD/R-induced inflammation levels. (A)
  QRT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α,
  and MCP-1 in OGD/R treated PC12 cells. (B) Western blot was performed to detect
  the protein expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in OGD/R treated
  PC12 cells. *p<0.05 vs. control group; †p<0.05 vs. OGD/R group; ‡p<0.05 vs. OGD/R+10
  µM didymin group; §p<0.05 vs. OGD/R+20 µM didymin group. IL, interleukin; OGD/R,
  oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MCP, monocyte
  chemotactic protein
