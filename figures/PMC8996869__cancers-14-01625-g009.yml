caption: miR-199a-5p inhibition and/or let-7a-5p activation impairs DU145 and PC3
  cell motility. (A,B) Representative images from the scratch assay (0 and 48 h) for
  DU145 and PC3 cells show the regulatory role of miR-199a-5p and let-7a-5p on cell
  migration (n = 3) (C,D). 25 nM of miR-199a-5p inhibitor and/or 10nM of let-7a-5p
  mimic significantly inhibited the motility of both DU145 and PC3 cells (n = 3)].
  * p < 0.001. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Matched miRNAs were further analyzed
  for their potential targets using DIANA-mirPath v 3.0 and dbEMT databases (A–D)
  for their potential regulating of EMT gene expression as presented in volcano plots
  (A,B), and compared to the NanoString® mRNA analysis ( and ).
