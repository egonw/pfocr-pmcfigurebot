caption: 'B4GalT5 was involved in the regulation of myocardial hypertrophy by UGCG.
  A Masson staining showed the overall degree of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis
  (N = 5). B–E Statistical charts of HW/BW, LW/BW, HW/TL, and LV collagen volume in
  different groups (N = 5). F, G The representative pictures of the size of the cross-sectional
  area of cardiomyocytes in the heart and corresponding statistical analysis histogram
  (N = 5). H–J Representative western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting
  ANP and BNP expressions in hearts (N = 3). K, L HE staining showed the cell surface
  area of cardiomyocytes from different groups (N = 5). M–O Western blot results of
  ANP and BNP expression levels in cardiomyocytes from different groups (N = 3). *p < 0.05.
