caption: 'Inhibiting the Wnt/NOTCH pathway caused CD44(+)CD24(+)EpCAM(+) cancer-initiating
  cells (CICs) to spontaneously differentiate into epithelial ductal carcinomas. (A)
  Representative bright-field images of control and differentiated cancer organoids.
  Scale bar, 40 μm. (B) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plot showing the
  surface expression of CD24, CD44, and EpCAM on human pancreatic cancer organoids
  and differentiated organoids. (Left) Two groups: (I) CD24(+)CD44(-) and (II) CD24(+)CD44(+)
  cells. (Right) EpCAM expression levels in the two groups. Dotted lines indicate
  fluorescence minus one (FMO). (C) Quantification of the CD24(+)CD44(-)EpCAM(+) and
  CD24(+)CD44(+)EpCAM(+) populations in control and differentiated organoids (N =
  3 biological replicates, **P < 0.05, Sidak multiple comparisons test). (D) CD44,
  CA2, and CEL mRNA levels (N = 3 biological replicates with at least triplicate experiments,
  **P < 0.05, ns = non-significant, Mann-Whitney U test). (E) Confocal image showing
  CA2 (green) expression in control and differentiated cancer organoids. Scale bar,
  100 µm.'
