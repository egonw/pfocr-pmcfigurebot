caption: Pathway and function analysis of THC vs. CBD treatment induced differentially
  expressed genes in cancer. Differentially expressed genes in cancer cells treated
  with THC () or CBD () were analyzed for their contribution to common cellular functions
  in cancer using IPA (Qiagen). Genes identified by the IPA database as members of
  the “apoptosis”, “proliferation of cancer cells”, “metabolic process of cholesterol”,
  or “metabolic process of reactive oxygen species” pathways are shown for THC (top)
  and CBD (bottom).
