caption: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Nrf2, HO-1 and Rap1b expression levels.
  (A) Differences in the cumulative OS among patients with Nrf2 protein expression.
  (B) Differences in the cumulative OS among patients with HO-1 protein expression.
  (C) Differences in cumulative OS among patients with Nrf2 and Rap1b protein expression.
  The P-value was obtained using the log-rank test of the difference. (**P<0.001).
