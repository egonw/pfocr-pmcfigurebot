caption: 'Therapeutic approaches to treat metastatic disease are varied, eliciting
  anti-tumor properties although not without secondary effects to the surrounding
  musculoskeletal tissues. (A) Surgical removal of diseased tissue typically includes
  amputation, heightening skeletal morbidity. Pharmacological blockade or surgical
  removal of tissues that produce sex steroids to limit tumor progression can act
  negatively on musculoskeletal tissue, as estrogens and testosterones are major regulators
  of physiological bone remodeling. (B) Chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly in combination
  with bone-targeted agents (C) are employed in combination and in varying time schemas
  to attack tumor in bone while suppressing heightened resorption with anti-resorptive
  drugs. (D) TGF-Î² pathway inhibitors have been tested for their efficacy in reducing
  tumor burden in preclinical animal models and clinical trials. Small molecules with
  radioactive properties, such as radium-223, exhibit dual targeting properties to
  reduce tumor burden and improve bone health in metastatic bone diseases. (E) Many
  radiation therapies are a means of targeting difficult to reach tumors and as a
  palliative care approach; however, damage to nearby bone tissue and the underlying
  stem cell pool can increase fracture risk for patients treated following high-dose
  radiation. (F) The burgeoning field of immunotherapies utilize CAR-T and other antigen-presenting
  schemas to activate lymphocytes to target tumor cells, while (G) senolytic compounds
  are being explored as a means to induce tumor cell senescence. Patients with metastatic
  bone disease exhibit a high degree of bone pain; therefore, palliation casts a wide
  net, with (H) interventions ranging from tumor ablation to pharmacological suppression
  of pain receptors. (Note: Red arrows indicate adverse effect on bone).'
