caption: MAPK signaling re-activated led to angiogenesis and resistance to sorafenib.
  (A) WB for MAPK pathway in tumor tissue(n = 5). (B) WB for MAPK pathway in BNL cells(n = 3).
  (C) GSEA of tumor tissue involved in MAPKpathways(n = 5). The normalized enrichment
  scores (NES) and tests of statistical significance (FDR) are shown. (D) Representative
  images(Scale bar = 200 μm) of tumor sections stained IHC with CD31 for sprouting
  neomicrovessels. Positive area was analyzed by ImageJ(n = 3) (E)VEGFA immunostaining
  images of tumor tissues(Scale bar = 100 μm). Positive area was analyzed by ImageJ(n = 3).
  Specific n values of biological independent experiments. ANOVA for four groups comparisons
  and Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Asterisks indicate comparison with the
  control group. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
