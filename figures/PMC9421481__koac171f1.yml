caption: Plant growth and lignin phenotypes of Brachypodium RNAi lines. A, Visual
  phenotypes of lignin pathway gene KD lines and WT control Brachypodium plants grown
  in pots in the greenhouse for 30 days after germination. UV-microscopy and phloroglucinol-HCl
  staining of transverse mature stem sections of the genotypes studied. B, Relative
  yields of the lignin-derived thioacidolysis monomers recovered from H, G, or S β-O-4-linked
  lignin units (in micromoles per gram of AIR, relative (%) monolignol composition,
  and S/G ratios in the same stem internodes. ch, chlorenchyma; sc, sclerenchyma;
  if, interfascicular fibers; ph, phloem; xv, xylem vessels; bs, bundle sheath; xp,
  xylem parenchyma, vb, vascular bundle; p, parenchyma. Lignin monomers H, G, and
  S. Box plots indicate the median (center lines), interquartile range (hinges), and
  whiskers represents min and max values. Green and blue asterisks indicate significant
  upregulated and downregulated lignin content/composition, respectively (P < 0.05,
  one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test). ns, denotes no significant difference
  from control plants. Plants were harvested at 30 days after germination when the
  first inflorescence was emerging, equivalent to the booting stage in the BBCH-scale
  for cereals (). The more lignified lower internodes were used for microscopy, whereas
  the upper internodes from each plant were combined and used for lignin, metabolomic,
  and proteomic analyses.
