caption: Proposed mechanism of folecitin neuroprotection action against LPS-induced
  oxidative stress mediated memory impairment. Folecitin activated the p-Akt/HO-1/Nrf-2
  signalling pathway, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress, neurodegeneration,
  and associated neuronal synapse and memory impairment.
