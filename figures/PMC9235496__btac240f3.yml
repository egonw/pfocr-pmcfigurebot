caption: Classifications of perturbed genes according to protein class, biological
  process, and KEGG pathway. (A) Knockdown genes. (B) Overexpressed genes. The top
  panels show a classification based on protein family in PANTHER. Asterisks indicate
  the top five protein families; the subfamilies belonging to these protein families
  are shown in . The middle panels show a classification based on GO biological process.
  The bottom panels show a classification based on KEGG pathways; each label represents
  a pathway category
