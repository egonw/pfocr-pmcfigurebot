caption: Naringenin biosynthetic pathway and potential byproduct formation inS. cerevisiae.
  The conversion of p-coumaric acid to naringenin involves three enzymes, 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI). The unspecific
  activity of an endogenous enoyl reductase (Tsc13) leads to reduction of p-coumaroyl-CoA
  to p-dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA, which results in the formation of two byproducts, phloretic
  acid and phloretin.
