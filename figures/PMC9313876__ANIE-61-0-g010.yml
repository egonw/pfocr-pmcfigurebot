caption: Covalent functionalization of SWCNTs. a) The controlled introduction of sp3
  defects creates an alternative decay pathway that brightens dark excitons without
  destroying the normal E11 NIR fluorescence. Reprinted from Ref.  with permission.

  as generic handles to functionalize SWCNTs with biomolecules. Adapted from Ref. 
  with permission. c) The protonation of covalently attached aminobenzene groups modifies
  the energy level of the sp3 defect state and changes the photoluminescence. Adapted
  from Ref.  with permission. Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. d) Quantum
  defects change the fluorescence response of DNA‐functionalized SWCNTs to the important
  biomolecule and neurotransmitter dopamine. (GT)10‐functionalized pristine SWCNTs
  (pSWCNT) increase their fluorescence in response to dopamine. The same SWCNTs with
  sp3 defects (dSWCNT) decrease their fluorescence, which shows the strong impact
  of defects on the sensing mechanism. Adapted from Ref.  with permission. Copyright
