caption: 'Profiling of miRNAs in the induced exosomes from endometrial cancer (EC)
  cells; (a) The heatmap for microRNA in exosomes induced by the three substances.
  (b) The Venn diagram for microRNAs in EC cells in the presence of three substances.
  (c) The scattering plots of the control and bioactive substances. (d) The microRNAs
  involved in several categories (A: positive regulation of autophagy, B: drug transmembrane
  transport, C: positive regulation of cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis,
  D: estrogen biosynthetic process, E: positive regulation of prostaglandin biosynthetic
  process, F: mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport, G: positive regulation
  of DNA repair and regulation of innate immune response, H: negative regulation of
  intracellular estrogen receptor signaling pathway, I: positive regulation of DNA
  repair. (e) The biological classification of significant microRNAs in the induced
  exosomes; 5 μg/mL tocopherol-α (TP5), 25 μg/mL rutin (R25), and 1000 μg/mL A. helianthus
  extract (AH1000). 2 times ≤ fold changes and 0.5 times ≥ fold changes; * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
