caption: Schematic of a site-specific novel modification in the DNA damage response
  (DDR). (A) Histone novel modification sites involved in the DDR are shown. (B) Upon
  DNA damage, histone PTMs trigger ATM activation or homologous recombination (HR)
  pathway, initiating DNA damage response. In addition, some histone modification
  could perform chromatin regulation.
