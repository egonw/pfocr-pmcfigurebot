caption: ILK and a-SMA are overexpressed in hypertrophic scars and keloids. Representative
  cases of control skin (upper panel), hypertrophic scars (middle panel) and keloids
  (lower panel) show stronger immunopositivity for ILK and a-SMA in keloids compared
  to scars (magnification 40×). Scale bar at 20 μm (ImageJfiji software).
