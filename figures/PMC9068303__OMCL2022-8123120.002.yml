caption: ZQL-4c significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells. (a)–(c)
  MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of
  ZQL-4c for increasing times. Line graphs showed the percentage of viable MCF-7,
  MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells after treatment with 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and
  8.0 μmol/L ZQL-4c for 24 and 48 h, as determined by the CCK8 assay. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± standard error of the mean of three independent experiments performed
  in triplicate (n = 3; ∗P < 0.05). (d) Histogram showing the IC50 values (24 h and
  48 h) of ZQL-4c in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells.
