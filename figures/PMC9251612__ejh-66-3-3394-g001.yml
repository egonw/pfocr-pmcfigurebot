caption: Identification of BMSCs and EVs. The BMSCs obtained from ATCC were subcultured.
  A) The morphology of BMSCs in the fourth generation was observed by microscope.
  B) The positive marker proteins (CD29, CD44, and CD71) were positively expressed
  and negative marker proteins (HLA-DR, CD34, and CD45) of BMSCs were negatively expressed
  detected using flow cytometry. C) Lipid differentiation was observed by oil red
  O staining. D) Alizarin red staining was used to observe osteogenic differentiation;
  the EVs were extracted. E) The morphology of BMSCs-EVs was observed with a typical
  cup shape by TEM. F) The size distribution of EVs was mainly at about 100 nm analyzed
  using NTA. G) WB detected that the expressions of EV surface CD9, CD63, and CD81
  enrichment and calnexin protein were not significantly expressed.
