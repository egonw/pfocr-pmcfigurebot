caption: Comparative and integrative analyses of the two RNA-seq datasets from SCS-treated
  HT-29 cells and NCM460 cells. (A) The analyses of the genes with reversely changed
  expression by the KEGG enrichment analyses in HT-29 cells; (B) The analyses of the
  genes with reversely changed expression by the KEGG enrichment analyses in NCM460
  cells; (C) The gene-gene interaction network in response in HT-29 cells treated
  with SCS; (D) The gene-gene interaction network in response in NCM460 cells treated
  with SCS; (E) Heat maps show that displayed altered expression of genes in HT-29
  cells and NCM460 cells after SCS treatment. Among the 88 genes related to cell cycle
  and apoptosis pathway, 32 genes in HT-29 cells were significantly different after
  SCS treatment (fold change > 1.5, p-value < 0.05), while only 5 genes in NCM460
  were significantly different, * indicates p-value < 0.05; (F) Regulatory network
  of SCS inhibiting the development of colorectal cancer was predicted.
