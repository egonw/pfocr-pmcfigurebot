caption: GSEA plots of enriched KEGG pathways. a GSEA plots indicating the running
  enrichment score for gene expression signature of ‘cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction’
  (NES = 1.89, padj = 0.0001), and its associated top up-regaulted genes (b) visualized
  in a heatmap, in addition to the GSEA plot for the (c) ‘neuroactive ligand-receptor
  interaction’ pathway (NES = 1.76, padj = 0.0001) and its associated top activated
  genes (d). Black bars underneath the graph present the rank positions of genes from
  the gene set, the green line refers to the enrichment profile. GO, KEGG and GSEA
  were performed by the R package clusterProfiler; R package DOSE; R package org.HS.eg.db.
  and visualized by the R package Enrichplot and R package ggplot2
