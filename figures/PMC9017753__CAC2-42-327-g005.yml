caption: 'METTL3‐PBX1 axis elevated BH4 induced GC cells metabolism reprogramming.
  (A) The de novo biosynthesis pathway of BH4 in eukaryotic cells and the function
  site of GCH1 and SPRi3. (B) ELISA assay measured the BH4 levels in cell lysis solution
  (normalized by total protein) in AGS cells (WT, catalytic mutant METTL3‐overexpressing,
  and the blank control). (C) ELISA assay measured the BH4 level in AGS cells (METTL3
  knockdown and negative control). (D) ELISA assay measured the BH4 levels in cell
  lysis solution of AGS cells with PBX1 knockdown and negative control. (E) GO analysis
  of different genes in BH4‐treated AGS cells. (F) mRNA levels of NOS2‐3 in METTL3
  overexpressed AGS cells and corresponding controls, as measured by qPCR. (G) ELISA
  quantified the NO levels of cell lysis solution in AGS cells overexpressing METTL3
  (normalized by total protein). (H‐I) mRNA levels of NOS2‐3 (H) and NO levels (I)
  in METTL3 knockdown AGS cells and corresponding controls. (J) mRNA levels of NOS2‐3
  in AGS cells treated with BH4 or distilled deionized water (blank), as measured
  via qPCR. (K) ELISA quantified the NO levels in AGS cells treated with BH4 or blank.
  (L) The volcano plot showed the different metabolites of AGS cells on BH4 treated.
  The data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *, P <0.05;
  **, P <0.01; ***, P <0.001; ns, not significant. Abbreviations: BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin;
  SPRi3, SPR inhibitor 3; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; ELISA, enzyme‐linked
  immunosorbent assay'
