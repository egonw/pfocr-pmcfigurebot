caption: 'Effect of ROCK2 silencing on LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis in HK-2
  cells. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was utilized to measure the mRNA
  level of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in HK-2 cells. (B) ELISA was employed to determine
  the production of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. (C) TUNEL staining was utilized to measure
  HK-2 apoptosis. ***P<0.001 vs. control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + shRNA-NC.
  ROCK2, Rho-associated protein kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; sh, short hairpin;
  NC, negative control.'
