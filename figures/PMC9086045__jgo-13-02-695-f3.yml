caption: miRNA-320 inhibits cell proliferation. (A,B) Cell proliferation was measured
  by CCK-8 assays and plate colony formation assays (stained with Giemsa) in HT29
  and SW480 cells transfected with LV-miRNA-320 or control (A) and HCT116 and DLD1
  cells transfected with LV-anti-miRNA-320 or control (B). (C) The protein expression
  of BCL-xl and PCNA in HT29, SW480 cells, HCT116, and DLD1 cells. The same column
  was GAPDH as an internal control. (D) Image of subcutaneous xenograft tumors. Nude
  mice were injected with 1×107 HT29 cells transfected with LV-miRNA-320 (n=6/group).
  The tumors were extracted after 21 days. Analysis of the tumor volume measured every
  3 days. Tumor weight in each group at the end of the experiment. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. miRNA, microRNA; CCK-8, Cell Counting
  Kit-8; BCL-xl, B-cell lymphoma-extra large; LV, lentiviral vector; PCNA, proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen; GAPDH, glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SD, standard
  deviation.
