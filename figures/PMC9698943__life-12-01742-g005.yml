caption: Involvement of ATAD1 in mitochondrial structure and cell cycle progression
  in PRAD. Enrichment analysis of TCGA-PRAD samples was conducted by using the LinkedOmics
  functional modules. (A), Volcano plot showing the Pearson correlation coefficient
  and p value of the ATAD1-coexpressed genes; (B,C) heatmap showing top 50 positively
  (B) and negatively (C) correlated genes with ATAD1; (D,E) bar chart showing the
  normalized enrichment score, involved gene count and false discovery rate (FDR)
  of the gene ontology cellular component (GO_CC) terms (D) and Panther pathway terms
  (E); (F,G) dot pots showing the correlation between ATAD1 and mitochondrial structure
  genes such as NDUFS6 (F) and IMMT (G); (H,I) dot pots of the correlation between
  ATAD1 and cell cycle progression genes such as MKI67 (H) and CDK4 (I).
