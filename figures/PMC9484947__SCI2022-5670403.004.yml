caption: 'GSK-3β regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway in IL-1β-induced inflammation.
  Phosphorylation and/or total expression of IKKβ, IKKα/β, IκBα, and NF-κB p65 (a)
  and (b) were detected by western blotting. Visualization and quantification of the
  expression of cytoplasmic (c) and (d) and nuclear (e) and (f) NF-κB p65. All results
  are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). NS: not significant, ∗P < 0.05, and ∗∗P
  < 0.01.'
article_title: Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β inhibits BMSCs Chondrogenesis in Inflammation
