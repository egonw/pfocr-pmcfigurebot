caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins. The abscissa
  is the rich factor. The greater the rich factor value, the greater the enrichment
  degree. The ordinate is the name of the metabolic pathway. The color represents
  the magnitude of the P value. The size of the circle represents the amount of protein.
  (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the Web version of this article.)
