caption: Identification of mRNAs binding to Ybx-1 in NRCMs. (A) Experimental design
  for RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP)-Seq in NRCMs. NRCMs were treated with PE (50uM)
  for 24 h and then harvested. Beads and antibody were incubated at room temperature
  for an hour and then the cell lysate was added to the mixture. The protein (Ag)-antibody
  (Ab) bead mixture was incubated overnight and then washed to remove any unbound
  protein from the beads. Finally, RNA was isolated and used for RNA-Seq. Illustration
  created with Biorender.com (B) Immunoblot showing the binding of Ybx1 after immunoprecipitation.
  (C) Scatter plot of the mRNAs bound to Ybx1 identified by RIP-seq in NRCMs. Full
  data set can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Ybx1 mRNA is known to bind its own
  transcript and is, therefore, highlighted in red. (D) Validation of the hits from
  the RIP-Seq by RIP–RT–PCR. Ybx1, Foxp1, Aldoa, Ide were taken as positive controls
  and Carns was used as negative control. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment for the mRNAs
  bound to Ybx1
