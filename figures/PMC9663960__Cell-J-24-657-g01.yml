caption: Expression of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) in different cell lines of liver cancers.
  A. Box diagram of PRDX1 expression, with significant difference between cancerous
  and paracancerous tissues of liver cancer patients. B. PRDX1 mRNA expression was
  significantly higher in cancerous cells. C. Western blot results showed an increased
  expression of PRDX1 protein in cancerous cells, with the highest expression level
  observed in hepatoma (HepG2) cells. D. Quantifications of protein levels. The experiment
  was repeated three times. Data represent mean Â± SEM. *; P<0.05, **; P<0.01, and
  ***; P<0.001.
