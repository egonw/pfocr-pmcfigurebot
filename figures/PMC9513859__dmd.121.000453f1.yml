caption: Experimental design of the study. Eight-week-old humanized ApoE3 and ApoE4
  transgenic mice (male and female) were exposed to CdCl2 (0.6 mg/l) via drinking
  water for 14 weeks (week 8 to week 22), and samples were collected at age 75 weeks.
  RNA-Seq was conducted in the liver and brain (n = 3 per sex per genotype per exposure).
  Differential gene analysis, pathway analysis (TopGo), and xenobiotic biotransformation
  related genes (transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes) were performed as described
  in Materials and Methods.
