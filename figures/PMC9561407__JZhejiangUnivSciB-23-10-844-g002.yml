figure_title: 'Mechanisms of action of lncRNA in the cell and its functions in tumorigenesis.
  (a‒d) The mechanisms of lncRNA modulate cell activities by interacting with multiple
  biomolecules: (a) LncRNA interacts with chromatin to epigenetically modulate gene
  expression; (b) LncRNA interacts with miRNA away from target mRNA (upper), and also
  binds to mRNA to affect its splicing, stability, and translation (lower); (c) LncRNA
  functions as a scaffold to modulate the interaction of function proteins (including
  signal pathway kinase and metabolic enzymes); (d) LncRNA sequesters biomolecules
  to form phase separation droplets to regulate cellular activities. (e) Functions
  of lncRNA in tumorigenesis: lncRNA promotes tumor progression through proliferation,
  angiogenesis, invasion, and metabolism remodeling by modulating signal pathways,
  cell metabolism, and gene expression. LncRNA: long noncoding RNA; miRNA: microRNA;
  mRNA: messenger RNA; TF: transferrin; RBP: RNA-binding protein; P: phosphorylation;
  TCA: tricarboxylic acid; ETC: electron transport chain'
