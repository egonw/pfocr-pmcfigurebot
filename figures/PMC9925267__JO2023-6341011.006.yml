caption: MALAT1 up-regulated STAT3 and activated PI3K/AKT pathway by adsorbing miR-370-3p
  to promote cisplatin resistance in CC cells. MALAT1 low expression plasmid and miR-370-3p
  inhibitors were co-transfected into Hela/R and C33A/R cells. (a) qRT-PCR was used
  to detect the level of STAT3. (b) The protein levels of phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K),
  total PI3K, phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT were detected by the Western
  blot method. Pretreatment of CC cisplatin-resistant cells with PI3K/AKT specific
  inhibitor LY294002. (c) CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. (d) Apoptosis
  was detected by flow cytometry. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. All experiments
  were performed at least three times.
