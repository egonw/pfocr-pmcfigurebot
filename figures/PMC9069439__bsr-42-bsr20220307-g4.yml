figure_title: p38 MAPK signaling contributed to TM or TG induced ER stress in THP-1
  cells
caption: '(A) Western blot analysis of p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, p-p38, NF-κB-p65 and GRP78
  in THP-1 cells treated with LPS and TM. (B) Western blot analysis of p-JNK, p-ERK1/2,
  p-p38, NF-κB-p65 and GRP78 in THP-1 cells treated with LPS and TG. GAPDH was loading
  control. Values were expressed as mean ± SD (n=5). *P<0.05 compared with untreated
  control cells. NS (not significant) compared with cells treated with LPS alone.
  #P<0.05 compared with cells treated with LPS alone.'
