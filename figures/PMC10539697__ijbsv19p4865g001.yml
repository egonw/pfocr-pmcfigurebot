caption: TOF improves pathology and morphology of the spinal cord after injury and
  promotes locomotor recovery. (A-C) Dorsal views of fresh spinal cords on days 7
  (A) and 14 (B) post-injury, and dorsal (left) or lateral (right) views of paraformaldehyde-treated
  spinal cords on day 28 (C) post-injury; black dashed lines indicate the lesion areas.
  (D, F) Representative HE-stained longitudinal and transverse sections of the spinal
  cord on day 28 post-injury. Scale bars = 500 μm. Two small images in (D) are the
  high-magnification view of area around the damage boundary, Scale bars = 100 μm.
  (E) Quantitative analysis of surface bleeding or deformation area in (A). (G) Representative
  images of swimming test in different groups. (H, I) The Basso Beattie Bresnahan
  (BBB) locomotion scores and Louisville Swim scores of different groups over 28-days
  period (The values are presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way
  ANOVA; n = 8 rats per group).
