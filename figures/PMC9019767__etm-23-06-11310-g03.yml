caption: Bioinformatics Analysis. (A) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of miRNA target
  genes. Most genes were enriched for the GO term regulation process as a biological
  process. (B) Protein-protein interaction network of the differentially expressed
  miRNAs in the process of the neurotransmitter transport. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of miRNA target genes. Most genes were enriched
  for the pathways. (D) Protein-protein interaction network of the differentially
  expressed miRNAs in the calcium signaling pathway.
