caption: 'The expression of representative proteins affected by Torularhodin (vs.
  HFD group). (A): Representative photographs of western blots; (B): Relative expression
  levels of proteins from western blot (WB) and proteomics data (Proteomics). The
  measured data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***:
  p < 0.001 (compared to HFD within the group).'
