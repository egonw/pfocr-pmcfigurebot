caption: 'ENO2 induced EMT through a lncRNA CYTOR-dependent pathway. (A–C): ENO2 induced
  the expression of mesenchymal genes. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression
  of EMT-related genes in stable cell lines. (D): RNA pull-down assay results showing
  that ENO2 was a CYTOR-binding protein. (E,F): The RIP experiment detected the binding
  of ENO2 to CYTOR and several EMT-related lncRNAs. (G): The OCLN level in RKO cells
  with ENO2 knockdown and CYTOR KO. (H): The migration and invasion of RKO cells with
  ENO2 knockdown and CYTOR KO. (I): Identification of full-length ENO2 and different
  truncated ENO2 sequences reintroduced into RKO ENO2 KO cells. (J): The functions
  of the ENO2 truncation mutants depicted in (I). (K): The function of single point
  mutations to amino acid residues 374–380 of ENO2. (L): RIP assay detected the binding
  of ENO2 single point mutation to CYTOR. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. ns: non significance.'
