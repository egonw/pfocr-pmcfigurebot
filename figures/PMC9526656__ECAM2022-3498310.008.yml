caption: 'Effect of Jatrorrhizine on the protein expressions of TLR4, MyD88, p-p65,
  and COX-2 in DSS-induced UC in mice. (a) Western blotting images of TLR4, MyD88,
  p-p65, p65, and GAPDH. (b) Relative TLR4 protein expression in colon tissue. (c)
  Relative MyD88 protein expression in colon tissue. (d) Western blotting images of
  COX-2 and GAPDH. (e) Relative p-p65/p65 protein expression in colon tissue. (f)
  Relative COX-2 protein expression in colon tissue. All data were presented as mean ± SD.
