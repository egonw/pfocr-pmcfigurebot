caption: 'Excerpt of the pathways showing a monotonal increase or decline in their
  activation scores with higher stage. Pathway activation scores were z-scaled across
  samples for visualization. Pathways are colored based on their database of origin.
  The top side of the heatmap presents dataset and clinical information. Samples (columns)
  are ordered based on the stage variable; from left to right: non-malignant adjacent
  urothelium (NAU), Ta, T1, T2, T3, and T4. Red lines indicate boundaries between
  adjacent stages.'
