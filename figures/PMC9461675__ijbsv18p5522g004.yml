caption: RNA-seq analysis of Ctsk-/-, Mmp9-/-, and Ctsk-/-/Mmp9-/- osteoclasts showed
  their distinct functions in regulating genes' expression and signaling pathway activation.
  (a) A volcano plot illustrating differentially regulated gene expression from RNA-seq
  analysis between the control Ctsk-/-, Mmp9-/-, and Ctsk-/-/Mmp9-/- osteoclasts.
  Values are presented as the log2 of tag counts. (b) Top upregulated signaling pathways
  in DKO osteoclasts analyzed by KEGG database. (c) Venn diagram showing the total
  number of differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) between Ctsk-/-/Mmp9-/-, Ctsk-/-,
  and Mmp9-/- mice. (d) RNA-seq comparison revealed the percentage of upregulated
  versus downregulated genes a total of 22669 genes expressed in respective mouse
  g©p. (e) Heatmap to confirm successful knockout of Ctsk and Mmp9. (f-k) Heatmaps
  of representative signaling pathways NF-κB, TNFα, TGF-beta, Hippo/YAP, RhoA, and
  osteoclast signaling in Ctsk-/-/Mmp9-/-, Ctsk-/-, and/or Mmp9-/- mice osteoclasts.
