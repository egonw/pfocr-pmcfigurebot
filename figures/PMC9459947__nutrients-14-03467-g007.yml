caption: 'Alteration of serum tryptophan metabolic pathway at 28 days post-TBI. Comparison
  of serum tryptophan (a) and major tryptophan metabolites in indole pathway (b),
  serotonin pathway (c), and kynurenine pathway (d) at 28 days post-TBI. (e) Major
  tryptophan metabolism pathways are involved: (1) Indole pathway: Tryptophan can
  be directly metabolized by the gut microbiota into indole derivatives; (2) Serotonin
  pathway: Peripheral production of the neurotransmitter serotonin by enterochromaffin
  cells is influenced by the gut microbiota, and the brain can also synthesize serotonin;
  (3) Kynurenine pathway: Kynurenine-producing pathway plays a critical role in immune
  response and neurobiological functions, which is also affected by gut microbiota.
  (f) The ratios of KYN/TRP and KYNA/KYN at 28 days post-TBI. ↑, increased; ↓, decreased
  in 28 days post-TBI mice. The tryptophan and its metabolite listed in the pathways
  were marked with black (unchanged), red (increased), and blue (decreased) solid
  boxes. Data are shown as median with range. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  using unpaired Student’s t test. TBI, traumatic brain injury; TRP, tryptophan; IPYA,
  indole-3-pyruvic acid; ILA, indole-3-lactic acid; IA, indole acrylic acid; IAAld,
  indole-3-acetaldehyde; IEt, indole-3-ethanol (tryptophol); IAM, indole-3-acetamide;
  IAA, indole acetic acid; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); 5-HIAA, 5-hydroxyindole
  acetic acid; IAA, indole acetic acid; KYNA, kynurenic acid; XA, xanthurenic acid;
  ns, no significant.'
