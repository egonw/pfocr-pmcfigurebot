caption: Overexpression of hsa_circ_0006470 inhibits the viability of GC cells via
  regulating miR-1234/TP53I11 axis and inhibiting Akt/FOXO1/CDK2 pathway. AGS cells
  were transfected withTP53I11 siRNA1, TP53I11 siRNA2, TP53I11 siRNA3 orTP53I11 siRNA-control.
  A) RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the level of TP53I11 in AGS cells. B) The viability
  of GC cells was assessed by CCK8 assay. C-G) Western blot assay was performed to
  evaluate the level of TP53I11, Akt, p-Akt, FOXO1 and CDK2 in AGS cells.**p<0.01
  compared with control group.
