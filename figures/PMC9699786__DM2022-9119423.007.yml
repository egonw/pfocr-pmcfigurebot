caption: TP inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells induced
  by HUVECs. HUVECs were treated with TP (0, 12.5, 25, or 50 nM) for 24 h, the media
  was changed to remove the effects of the drugs, and the treated HUVECs were cocultured
  with HepG2 cells in a transwell coculture chamber. The data showed that when HUVECs
  were treated with TP, its ability to promote the proliferation (a), migration (b),
  and invasion (c) of HepG2 cells was significantly inhibited. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01
  versus the control group.
