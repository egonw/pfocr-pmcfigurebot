caption: Overview of interlinked cellular signaling pathways involved in the proliferation
  and progression of colorectal cancer. In pathway A, TP53 normally inhibits activated
  RAS through lethal (Let) 7a23. However, Let-7a is not able to regulate activated
  RAS if TP53 is mutated. In pathway B, overactive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
  an oncogene, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β24, leading to β-catenin
  accumulation. EGF, epidermal growth factor; HER, human epidermal growth factor receptor;
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ErK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Mt, mitochondria; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1;
  IGF-1R/IR, IGF-1 receptor/insulin receptor; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate;
  PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; mTORC1/2, mammalian target of
  rapamycin complex 1/2; P70s6k, P70s6 kinase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli. Used
