caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment of non-transmembrane proteins. This figure shows
  the top 10 results of the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of non-transmembrane
  proteins. The y-axis was the name of signaling pathways and the x-axis was the gene
  ratio. Dots represent term enrichment with color coding: red indicates high enrichment,
  blue indicates low enrichment. The sizes of the dots represent the gene ratio of
  each term. The larger the dot, the larger percentage of genes'
