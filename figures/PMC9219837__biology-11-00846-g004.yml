caption: The effects of blocking the GABA shunt pathway and rewiring the GABA transport
  system on GABA production. (A) Time profiles of cell growth and glucose concentration
  during the shake flasks. The solid lines represent the growth, and the dotted lines
  represent the glucose concentration. (B) Time profile of GABA production during
  the shake flasks. Data shown are mean values with the standard deviation from three
  biological replicates.
