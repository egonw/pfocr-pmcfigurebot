caption: The effects of ellagic acid on the wild-type nematodes N2 under various stresses.
  (A) L4-stage worms were cultured on NGM plates containing 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and
  200 μM ellagic acid for two days and then exposed to a UV radiation dose of 1000
  J/cm2, n > 100. (B) Survival curves of the nematodes exposed to 0, 25, 50, and 100
  μM ellagic acid under thermal stress of 35 °C, n > 100. (C) L4-stage worms were
  cultured on NGM plates containing different concentrations of ellagic acid (0, 25,
  50, and 100 μM) for two days. After being exposed to H2O2-induced oxidative stress,
  the survival curves of the nematodes were observed every 0.5 h, n > 100. (D) Survival
  curves of the nematodes exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection with treatments
  of 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM ellagic acid, n > 100. p < 0.5 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and
  p < 0.001 (***).
