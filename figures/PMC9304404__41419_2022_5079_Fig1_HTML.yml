figure_title: Apatinib inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells
caption: A A549 and H460 cells were treated with apatinib at various concentrations
  (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Viabilities of the cells were evaluated
  by CCK8 assays. B IC50 values of apatinib in A549 and H460 cells at 24, 48, and
  72 h. C, D Representative images and statistical data of positive EdU staining (red)
  in NSCLC cells after treatment with 20 μM apatinib for 48 h. E, F The images and
  data statistics of the colony formation assay of A549 and H460 cells treated with
  apatinib. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.
article_title: Activated amino acid response pathway generates apatinib resistance
  by reprograming glutamine metabolism in non-small-cell lung cancer.
