caption: 'Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression in growing, static and
  retracting axon tips. Heat maps were constructed for those genes that showed significant
  differential expression patterns between growing (G), static (S) and retracting
  (R) axon tips: (A) A representative heat map cluster showing genes that were expressed
  significantly more in G than in S tips. (B) A similar heat map for genes that were
  expressed more in G tips than in R tips. (C) A similar heat map for genes that were
  expressed more in R tips than in G tips. The blue-to-red gradation represents levels
  in gene expression, from low to high. (D) Three gene lists identified that were
  consistently expressed more in G tips than in S and R tips (G > S and R, 38 genes),
  more in S tips than in G and R tips (S > G and R, 20 genes) or more in R tips than
  in G and S tips (R > G and S, 18 genes). Among them, map3k2 and csnk1e (red font)
  were significantly upregulated in G tips more than in S tips or R tips and are involved
  either in “MAPK-signaling-cascades” or in “circadian rhythms”, respectively. The
  gene mapk8(1) (green font) in the “S > G and R” list participates in “MAPK-signaling-cascades”,
  and the gene prkcq (purple font) in the “R > G and S” list participates in the T
  cell receptor signaling pathway.'
