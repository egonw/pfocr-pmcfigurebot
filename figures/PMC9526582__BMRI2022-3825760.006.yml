caption: Protein expressions of six genes. The protein expression analysis used the
  HPA database of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples. IHC images show the intensity
  and staining of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Manual scoring of IHC data
  for staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate, or strong) and proportion of stained
  cells (>75%, 25%~75%, or 25%) as determined by the protein expression score.
