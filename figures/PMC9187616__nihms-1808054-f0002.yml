figure_title: Bioorthogonal labeling of newly-synthesized lipids in B. thetaiotaomicron
  allows for detailed mapping of the Bacteroides lipidome
caption: (A) Schematic of strategy to trace bacterial sphingolipid (SL) transfer to
  host tissue. (B) Schematic of SL biosynthesis and integration of palmitic acid alkyne
  (PAA). PAA treatment of either wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron (BTWT) or its SL-null
  mutant (SLMUT), followed by chemical ligation of Alexa Fluor-647 Azide and confocal
  fluorescence microscopy (scale bars, 20 μm), or untargeted differential metabolomic
  analysis following high-resolution mass spectrometry. (C) Biosynthetic pathway of
  SLs synthesized using PAA. (D) Heat map of alkyne-bearing SLs following treatment
  with palmitic acid (PA), PAA, or no treatment. Previously uncharacterized SLs are
  noted in blue. See also  – .
