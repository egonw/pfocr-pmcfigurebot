figure_title: WT IFITM3 also accumulates in the cis-Golgi upon high levels of expression
  or prolonged IFN stimulation
caption: (A) HEK293T cells were transfected with a constant amount of DNA coding mEm.-VSV-G
  and increasing levels of DNA coding WT IFITM3, prior confocal microscopy 24 h later.
  Representative pictures and graph presenting the proportion of IFITM3-positive cells
  exhibiting normal or perinuclear accumulation of mEm.-VSV-G (binary scoring; two
  independent experiments; between 44 and 167 cells scored per sample). A magnified
  view of the indicated cells is provided in the inset. *P-value < 0.0001 following
  a one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test against the lowest dose of
  WT IFITM3 (0,1). (B) Purified primary blood lymphocytes were stimulated for 24 h
  with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies plus 150 U/ml of IL2, whereas primary monocytes
  were differentiated into macrophages upon incubation with M-CSF for 4 d. Both primary
  blood lymphocytes and macrophages were then stimulated for the indicated times with
  1,000 U/ml of IFNα2 to stimulate IFITMs expression, before confocal microscopy analysis.
  Representative pictures from experiments carried out with cells of three different
  donors. A549 cells were similarly treated, whereas HeLa cells that express IFITMs
  constitutively were directly analyzed. Pearson’s coefficients were determined for
  primary macrophages and A549 cells and are provided in extended data section, .Source
  data are available for this figure.
