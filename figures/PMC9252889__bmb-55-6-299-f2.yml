caption: ClC-5 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in CCA cells. After shClC-5
  transfection, proliferation was evaluated by EDU, CCK-8, and colony formation assays.
  (A, B) Representative EDU staining images (A) and statistical results of EDU-positive
  cells (B) in QBC939 cells; (C) Cell viability of QBC939 cells; (D, E) Representative
  EDU staining images (D) and statistical results of EDU-positive cells (E) in SNU-869
  cells; (F) Cell viability of SNU-869 cells; (G, H) Representative colony formation
  images (G) and statistical results of colony count (H) in both QBC939 and SNU-869
  cells. mean ± SD, n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. Control or shNC group.
