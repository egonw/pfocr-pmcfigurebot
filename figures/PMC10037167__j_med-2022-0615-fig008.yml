caption: 'Effects of sh-MSTN on the apoptosis and expressions of Smad3/PKA/Nox4 signaling
  pathway-related proteins in MN model rats. MN model rats were induced by c-BSA and
  then subjected to injection with 30 pmol/g of sh-MSTN or sh-NC. (a–d) Expression
  levels of the apoptosis-related proteins in rat renal tissues were examined by western
  blot, with GAPDH acting as the internal reference. (e–h) Western blot was also performed
  to measure the expressions of Smad3/PKA/Nox4 signaling pathway-related proteins
  in rat renal tissues, with GAPDH functioning as the internal reference. All experiments
  were repeated three times to obtain average values. The data are presented as the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments; &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001
  vs Control; +p < 0.05, ++p < 0.01, +++p < 0.001 vs Model + sh-NC. Abbreviation:
  MN, membranous nephropathy; MSTN, myostatin; p-PKA, phosphorylated-protein kinase
  A; Nox4, NADPH oxidase 4; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; sh-MSTN,
  short hairpin RNA targeting MSTN; sh-NC, shRNA negative control.'
