caption: Functional enrichment analyses of differentially expressed immune-related
  genes. (a) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The y-axis indicates the GO terms, and the
  x-axis indicates the number of the genes. Only the top 10 GO terms of biological
  process (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) are listed,
  respectively, in this figure. (b) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway analysis. The y-axis denotes the KEGG pathways, and the x-axis indicates
  the number of the genes. Spectrum (red to blue) indicates a significant level of
  enrichment from high to low.
