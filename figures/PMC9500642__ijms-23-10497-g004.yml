caption: 'LPA induced KLF5 expression via LPAR1 in HK-2 cells and db/db mice. (A)
  HK-2 cells were treated with 20 μM LPA in the presence or absence of 10 μM AM095
  for 30 min. (B) HK-2 cells were transfected with a control siRNA (siCon) or LPAR1
  siRNA (siLPAR1) and treated with 20 μM LPA for 30 min. (A,B) Protein levels of KLF5
  were analyzed via Western blotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and normalized
  to that of β-actin. Representative images (left) and quantitative analysis bar graphs
  (right) are shown (n = 3 independent experiments). Data are presented as the mean
  ± SEM. *** p < 0.005 vs. Con or siCon+BSA; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. LPA or siCon+LPA.
  (C) The animal experiments are described in the Materials and Methods section. Immunohistochemical
  detection of KLF5 was performed in the kidney tissues using DAB. The nuclei were
  counterstained with hematoxylin. The positive expression area of KLF5 was quantified
  using ImageJ software. Representative images (left) and quantitative analysis bar
  graph (right) are shown. Original magnification, 200×; scale bars, 20 μm; n = 3
  mice per group. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01 vs. wild-type
  (WT); # p < 0.05 vs. db/db.'
