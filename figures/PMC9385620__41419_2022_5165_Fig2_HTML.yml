figure_title: Identification of the proteins with Kcr in liver cancer
caption: a A workflow schematic illustration showing TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS analysis
  of Kcr proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent liver tissue. b The number
  of identified Kcr sites of each protein shown in pie chart. c Motif analysis of
  all indicated Kcr peptide. d Amino acid preference on both sides of the crotonylated
  lysine. e, f Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis of identified Kcr proteins. g The number
  of Kcr proteins identified in PLC/PRF/5 cells treated with hypoxia and normoxia.
  h Intracellular pathway enrichment analysis of the identified Kcr proteins in both
  groups.
