caption: Summary of hnRNP Functions in DNA repair. Most hnRNP proteins exhibit significant
  functional overlap across the major SSB and DSB repair pathways in addition to damage-induced
  signaling cascades mediated by upstream ATM and ATR kinases. Specific functions
  of each protein are detailed in . MMEJ is an alternative DSB repair pathway important
  to neuron genome stability (not shown). hnRNP proteins are indicated by dark red
  text boxes and identified by their named letter (e.g., hnRNP-K is represented by
  “K”) or initialism. Other repair factors are presented in blue. Created with BioRender.com.
