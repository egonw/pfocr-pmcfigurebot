caption: 'A4B17 outperforms enzalutamide in tumor growth inhibition(A) Assessment
  of compound toxicity in developing zebrafish embryos. The bar chart represents mortality
  rates of 48 zebrafish embryos in percentages following exposure to the indicated
  compounds. The results represent the averages of two biological replicates (∗: p < 0.05,
  and ∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001).(B) Images of examples of the embryos before and after hatching
  (24–96 hpf) following exposure to the indicated compounds. The images were taken
  with an automated ScanˆR IX 81 microscope (with Olympus Planapo lens 1.25x).(C)
  Comparison of the effect of the indicated concentrations of A4B17 and enzalutamide
  (10 mg/kg) on prostate and seminal vesicle weights following a 14-day treatment.
  The results represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗: p < 0.001).(D) Representative
  examples of some of the tumors obtained after treatment with vehicle, enzalutamide
  and A4B17.(E) Tumor volumes of established subcutaneous LAPC-4 xenografts obtained
  after castration and a 7-day recovery followed by daily treatment for 34 days with
  vehicle, enzalutamide (Enza, 10 mg/kg body weight), or A4B17 (15 mg/and 30 mg/kg
  body weight). The values are the mean ± SEM expressed relative to the initial tumor
  volume at the start of treatment, which was set at 100%. (n = 7 for each group,
  ∗: p = 0.0240, ∗∗∗: p ≤ 0.0001).(F) Mice body weights were measured twice weekly
  for all animals over the 34 days treatment period. Presented are the mouse body
  weight changes, in percentages, for each group. Also see  and .'
