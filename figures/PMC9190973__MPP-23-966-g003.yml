caption: Effect of salicylic acid (SA) pretreatment on isoflavonoid biosynthesis in
  R108. (a) Location of SA‐responsive cis‐acting TCA element in the 2‐kb upstream
  promoter region of IFS1 and IFR genes in A17 (black triangles) and R108 (striped
  maroon circles); IFS1, isoflavone synthase 1; IFR, isoflavone reductase. (b) Relative
  expression of IFS1 and IFR genes in R108 leaves 3 h after mock or 1 mM SA treatment.
  Data represent mean ± SEM of six biological replicates from two independent experiments.
  Significant differences were computed by unpaired t test (*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01)
  (c, d) Levels of total SA, medicarpin, jasmonic acid (JA), the 5‐deoxyisoflavonoid
  intermediates, and their precursor liquiritigenin in 3 h (preinoculation) and 48 h
  postinoculation (hpi) (after powdery mildew [PM]‐inoculation) SA‐ or mock‐treated
  R108 leaves. Data represent the mean ± SEM of 10 biological replicates from three
  independent experiments. Significant differences between mock and SA treatment and
  between time points were computed by unpaired t test (*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001,
  ****p ≤ 0.0001). (e) Proposed model showing the contribution of medicarpin and SA
  in PM resistance in Medicago truncatula. PM infection stimulates biosynthesis of
  medicarpin, SA, and JA. Medicarpin and SA act in concert, perhaps in a regulatory
  loop, triggering the localized accumulation of medicarpin and H2O2 at fungal penetration
  sites that leads to hypersensitive response and PM resistance
