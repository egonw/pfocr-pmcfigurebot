caption: The optimized activation of PARP1 regulated mice anxiety and epileptic behavior.
  (A–H) The results of the PTZ kindling test. The chart representing the seizure stage
  classification of the scores from mice with indicated genotypes and treatments,
  before and after the PTZ injection (A and E). Statistical analysis results of the
  cumulative number of maximum (B and F) and all (C and G) seizure stage, and the
  ratio of the occurrence of stage 4 (D and H). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n
  = 10 mouse pairs). **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 (Student’s t tests). (I–M) The heatmap
  of the occupancy of individual mice with indicated pharmacological treatments in
  OFT. A warmer color represents more time spent (red > yellow > green > blue), and
  red rectangles are put at the central zones in the fields (I). The OFT results of
  individual mice with the indicated treatments. Total distances that mice ran during
  tests (J), cumulative durations in the edge zone (K) or the central zone (L), and
  in-zone frequencies to the central zone (M) are represented. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 10 mouse pairs). n.s., P > 0.5, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA).
