caption: 'Models of hedgehog (Hh) pathway involvement in cancer: (a) type I: the ligand
  independent pathway results from either an inactivating mutation (red star) to Patched
  (PTCH) or an activating mutation (green star), to Smoothened (SMO), bypassing the
  need for Hh ligand binding, (b) type II: the autocrine/juxtacrine pathway involves
  an overexpression of Hh, which activates the Hh pathway on the same, or adjacent
  cells, (c) type III: the paracrine model involves aberrant Hh expression from tumor
  cells, which activates the Hh pathway on nearby stromal cells. The stromal cells
  in turn secrete growth/survival signals to the tumor cells, (d) type IIIb: in the
  reverse paracrine pathway, stromal cells express Hh, which binds the PTCH receptor
  on nearby tumor cells, (e) cancer stem cell (CSC): like reverse paracrine, stromal
  cells express Hh, which activates the Hh pathway in CSC’s. CSC’s can then activate
  the Hh pathway in other CSC’s, or differentiate into bulk tumor cells, and (f) non-canonical:
  Hh target genes are activated in a pathway independent of PTCH-SMO signaling. Created
  with BioRender.com.'
