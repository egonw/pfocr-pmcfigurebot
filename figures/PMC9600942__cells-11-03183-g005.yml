caption: Mechanisms of DC tolerance in the tumor microenvironment. It is possible
  for tumor-derived soluble mediators to functionally tolerate DCs located inside
  tumor beds, tumor-draining lymph node tissues, or at more distant metastatic sites.
  This pathway promotes DC-dependent Treg differentiation while suppressing DC-mediated
  effector T cell responses, which aids in tumor development and progression. Reproduced
