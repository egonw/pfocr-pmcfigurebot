caption: Compound C Inhibited U937-OvCa Crosstalk. (A). Schema showing experimental
  design of macrophage chemotaxis towards OvCa cells, left. The effect of CC on migration
  of human U937 towards SKOV3, OVCAR3, IGROV1, and CaOV3 cells as well as murine RAW
  264.7 towards ID8 cells, right. (B). Schema showing experimental design of macrophage
  induced OvCa migration, left. Bars represent mean  ±  SEM; (n = 3/experimental condition),
  p-value using Student’s t-test. (C). Schema of the co-culture of U937 and SKOV3.
  Bottom, Western blots showing the effect of CC on the expression of total and phosphorylated
  p65RelA subunit of NFκB in U937 and OvCa cocultures, with HSP90 as loading control.
