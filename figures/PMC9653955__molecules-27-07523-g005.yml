caption: Percentage of viable, apoptotic, or necrotic, HTB75 cells (a) or HTB161 cells
  (b) following treatment with niraparib (5.1 µg/mL and 24.8 µg/mL respectively),
  F5 (19.1 µg/mL and 26.2 µg/mL respectively), F7 (19.4 µg/mL and 24.5 µg/mL respectively),
  F5-SM (17.4 µg/mL and 30.1 respectively), or F7-SM (16.3 µg/mL and 30.1 µg/mL respectively)
  for 48 h. 104 cells were analyzed per treatment. Control was vehicle control (1%
  methanol or 0.5% DMSO v/v for HTB75 and 3% methanol or 1.2% DMSO v/v for HTB161).
  The treated cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry following annexin
  V-FITC/PI staining. Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 3). Levels with different Upper
  or lower case letters of similar font and style were significantly different from
  all combinations of pairs according to the Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference
  (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
