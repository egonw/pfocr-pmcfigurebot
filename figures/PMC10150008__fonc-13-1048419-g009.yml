caption: Global proteomic profiling of subcluster A miRNA expression in 769-P cells
  identifies ATXN-2 as a downregulated target. (A) Bar graph representation of 19
  targets for miRNA subcluster overexpressed cells with p<0.05 and Z-score >1. The
  chromosomal locations are indicated with the y-axis labels. (B) Volcano plot demonstrating
  subcluster A miRNA-induced differentially expressed proteins with proteins highlighted
  in red representing additional filtering related to fold-change (Welch’s t-test,
  p<0.05 and Z-score>3). (C) Hierarchical clustering showing two major groups and
  related cluster-specific gene ontology enrichment results for selected biologically
  relevant pathways (Fisher’s Exact test with a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR<0.05). (D)
  Analyses via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was subsequently performed to identify miRNA
  and proteome dataset relationships. Upregulation of miR-432-3p is predicted to affect
  the experimentally observed downregulation of several proteins, which included the
  highly downregulated target ATXN-2, as well as other targets that overlap with renal
  cancer biomarkers (CDH6) and necrosis of kidney (CDH6 and RBM7). (E) The downstream
  effect on apoptosis signaling was also a predicted result of decreased expression
  of BAD and MAPK8, which are targets of miR-127-3p and miR-433-3p. (F) Upregulated
  miR-127-3p and miR-127-5p are predicted to downregulate several experimentally observed
  proteins identified from proteomic analysis, which are associated with pathophysiological
  processes of the kidney.
