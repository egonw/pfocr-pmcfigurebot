caption: Specific prediction of CIAPIN 1 signaling pathway in metastasis of CCA cells.
  CIAPIN1 was predicted to be involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²)
  and SMADs signaling pathway through NOS1 in the metastasis process of CCA cells
  (red rectangle). Thicker lines represent strong associations. Thin lines represent
  weak associations.
