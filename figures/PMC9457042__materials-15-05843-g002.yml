caption: 'Cell viability of U87 and Hs5 cells treated and untreated with GN and rGO
  flakes, as evaluated by the neutral red assay. U87 and Hs5 cells were exposed to
  GN and rGO flakes at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL for 24 h. Values
  are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance between the
  control and treated cells is indicated by an asterisk and was assessed using Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically
  significant. One asterisk (*) indicates p < 0.01, two asterisk (**) indicates p
  < 0.005, three asterisks (***) indicate p < 0.001, four asterisk (****) indicate
  p < 0.0001. Abbreviations: rGO, reduced graphene oxide; GN, graphene; C, control
  group (untreated group); ExF, exfoliation; ATS, ammonium thiosulphate; TUD, thiourea
  dioxide; ns, not significant.'
