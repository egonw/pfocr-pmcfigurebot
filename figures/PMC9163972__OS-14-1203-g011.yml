caption: Bnd reduced bone loss in OVX mice by inhibiting CCL2 and CCL7 expression.
  (A) Representative TRAP staining of the proximal tibia (n = 8 per group). (B–C,
  E) E2 and Bnd significantly inhibited the increases in the number and size of osteoclasts
  and the osteoclast surface area‐to‐bone surface area ratio after ovariectomy in
  mice (all P < 0.01). (D) Representative 3D μ‐CT of the proximal tibia (n = 5 per
  group). (F–K) The BMD (F), BV/TV (G), Tb.N (H), and Tb.Th (I) values decreased significantly
  after ovariectomy, and the SMI (J) and Tb.Sp (K) values were obviously increased
  in the OVX group (all P ≤ 0.01); however, E2 and Bnd significantly improved these
  indicators to reduce bone loss. (L‐N) CCL2 and CCL7 expression in the growth plate
  (L) was increased significantly after ovariectomy and was inhibited by E2 and Bnd
  (all P < 0.01) All differences were tested using one‐way ANOVA and Tukey's test;
  ns, not significant; *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001.
