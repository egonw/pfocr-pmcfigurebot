caption: The relative protein expression of the NF-κB signaling pathway on the mice
  kidneys in the HTE (40, 400 and 4000 mg/kg) subacute administration study. All data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (a) Expression of the NF-κB signaling pathway-related
  proteins in female mice. (b) Expression of the NF-κB signaling pathway-related proteins
  in male mice. Significance was analyzed by using the Student’s t-test. Compared
  with the control, * and ** represent 0.01 < p < 0.05 and 0.001 < p < 0.01, respectively.
