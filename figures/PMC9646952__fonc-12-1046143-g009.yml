caption: Hematoxylin and eosin staining assay of the lung, liver, and kidney. (A)
  Images of hematoxylin and eosin stained tissues. The left column shows cell types
  of subcutaneous tumor and types of stained tissue. The top line shows drug treatments,
  where ‘Normal’ represents healthy mice, and ‘Control’ represents tumor-burdened
  mice without drug treatment. Scale bars, 100 μm. (B) Quantitation of the number
  and vessel area of central veins in the hepatic lobules in every group. ImageJ was
  used to quantify the vessel diameter of central veins. Five pictures of the liver
  used in the column diagram were added as  in . (C) Concentrations of serum AST and
  ALT were determined in mice in different groups. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D.
  One-way ANOVA was used to analyze P values between groups. All groups are compared
  with the ‘Normal’ group, and the ‘CTX’ group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’ group.
  *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
