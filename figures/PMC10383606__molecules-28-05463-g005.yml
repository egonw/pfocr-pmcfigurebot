caption: Effects of RCE on TNF-α and IFN-γ induced MAPK signaling pathway in HaCaT
  cells. The cells were pretreated with 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL RCE for 2 h, followed
  by exposure to TNF-α and IFN-γ (10 ng/mL each) for 30 min. Cell extracts were prepared
  and MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies.
  (a) Results of Western blotting and (b) protein levels of MAPKs. Equal protein loadings
  were confirmed by measuring phospho-ERK, ERK, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-p38, p38,
  and actin expression. Protein levels were quantified using the Image Lab software
  (version 5.2.1). All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. TNF-α- and IFN-γ-stimulated cells.
