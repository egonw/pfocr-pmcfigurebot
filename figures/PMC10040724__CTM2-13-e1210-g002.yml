caption: Depletion of MORC2 enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to PTX and VCR.
  (A, B) WT and MORC2‐KO HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated with indicated doses of
  PTX for 24 h (A) or with 100 nM PTX for the indicated times (B). Immunoblotting
  analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of H3 pS10. (C, D) WT and
  MORC2‐KO HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated with 100 nM VCR for 24 h (C) or with
  100 nM VCR for the indicated times (D). Immunoblotting analysis was performed to
  detect the expression levels of H3 pS10. (E, F) WT and MORC2‐KO HeLa and MCF‐7 cells
  were treated with indicated doses of PTX (E) or VCR (F) for 48 h. Apoptosis analysis
  via flow cytometry was performed to detect the percentage of cells that undergo
  apoptosis in response to drug treatment. (G–I) WT and MORC2‐KO HeLa and MCF‐7 cells
  were treated with PTX or VCR at indicated concentrations and subjected to colony
  formation assays. After 10−14 days of treatment, survival colonies were stained
  with 1% crystal violet and counted. Representative images of survival colonies are
  presented in G, and the corresponding quantitative results are shown in H and I.
  (J, K) The correlation between MORC2 expression levels and drug activity of PTX
  (J) and vinorelbine (K) was analyzed using the CellMiner database.
