figure_title: AMPK inhibitor Compound C reversed the effects of ADPN on lipid content
  in cultured chicken myoblasts
caption: '(A) Representative bands of AMPK, ACC. The protein expressions of AMPK and
  ACC in cultured chicken myoblasts were determined by Western blot. (B) TG (triglyceride)
  in chicken myoblasts was detected by triglyceride reagent kit. (C) TCH (total cholesterol)
  in chicken myoblasts was detected by total cholesterol reagent kit. (D) Oil Red
  O staining of lipid droplets photographed at 400× magnification. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. #P<0.1, *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; n=6 in each group.'
