caption: Analysis of the Interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling pathway downstream cellular
  events in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157. Cells were treated with recombinant human IL-6
  (rIL-6), with neutralizing antibody anti-human IL-6 (Tocilizumab; TCZ), and with
  an inhibitor of the IL-6 signaling pathway molecule, STAT3 (STATTIC; STC), for 24
  h. Untreated cells were used as the control (A). The expression of phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 was measured using flow cytometry. (B) Cytosolic calcium levels were measured
  by using Fluo 4 AM. * p < 0.05. Three independent experiments were performed.
