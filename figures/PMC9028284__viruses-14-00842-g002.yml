caption: HuNoV infection promotes AQP1 expression. (A). HuNoV replicated in HIEs.
  HIEs were infected with HuNoV at a genome copy of 3.5 × 107. At the indicated time,
  the copies of HuNoV genome were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. (B–D).
  HuNoV induced the production of AQP1 at the mRNA and protein levels. HIEs were infected
  with HuNoV at a genome copy of 3.5 × 107. At 24 h post-infection, the expressions
  of AQP1 and VP1 were detected by WB (C) and quantified using Image J (D). The expression
  of AQP1 was evaluated by relative real-time quantitative PCR (B). (E,F). The enterovirus
  EV71 did not change the expression of AQP1. Caco2 cells were infected with EV71
  at an MOI of 0.05 for 24 h, and the expression of AQP1 was subsequently detected
  by WB (E) and quantified using Image J (F). For graphs, data shown are mean ± S.D.
  of three independent experiments with each condition performed in triplicate. For
  images, one representative experiment out of three is shown. *** p < 0.001.
