caption: Possible mechanism of BMSCs therapy for SAP. Oxidative stress is boosted
  in pancreas as consequence of various injuries. The expression of Nrf2 will decreased
  in PACs, leading to antioxidant capacity decline in SAP. In addition, BMSCs may
  upregulate Nrf2 expression and induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation via the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, which enhance antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in SAP
article_title: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate severe acute
  pancreatitis by inhibiting oxidative stress in rats.
