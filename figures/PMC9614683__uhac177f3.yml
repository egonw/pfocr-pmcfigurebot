caption: UBA2a/b positively regulates SA signalling pathway. a Transient expression
  of StUBA2a/b in N. benthamiana promotes PR gene expressions. Total RNAs were extracted
  from N. benthamiana leaves expressing StUBA2a/b-GFP or GUS-GFP for 2 days, and each
  sample was prepared with four leaves. b Silencing of NbUBA2a/b in N. benthamiana
  decreased the expression level of PR genes. N. benthamiana was agro-infiltrated
  with TRV-NbUBA2a/b or TRV-GUS, respectively. The middle leaves from four independent
  TRV-NbUBA2a/b or TRV-GUS plants at 3 weeks after agro-infiltration were used for
  RNA extraction. The expression levels of NbPR1 and NbPR2 were quantified by qRT-PCR.
  NbACTIN was used as the reference gene. Statistical analyses were performed with
  one-sided t-tests (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). Error bars indicate the standard
  deviations. c The cell death induced by StUBA2a/b-GFP in N. benthamiana leaves.
  The final agrobacterial suspension culture densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 (OD600)
  were used in the infiltration. d Representative photographs of StUBA2a/b-induced
  cell death (CD) in NbSGT1-silenced and the control TRV-GUS N. benthamiana. StUBA2a/b-GFP
  (OD600 = 1.0) was infiltrated into the middle leaves of TRV-NbSGT1 or TRV-GUS plants.
  Photographs were recorded at 8 dpi. e Statistical analysis of the StUBA2a/b-induced
  CD levels in TRV-NbSGT1 and TRV-GUS plants. The CD levels were defined by the percentage
  of necrotic area in the infiltration area and recorded at 8 dpi. f–h StUBA2a/b induced
  CD is suppressed by the salicylate hydroxylase NahG. StUBA2a/b-GFP was co-expressed
  with NahG or GFP control. The representative photographs were taken at 7 dpi (f).
  Both CD level analysis (g) and the relative ion leakage assay (h) showed the significant
  suppression of StUBA2a/b-induced CD when co-expressing with NahG. The white circles
  mark agro-infiltration area. The total number of infiltration sites was shown above
  the columns in (e) and (g). One-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and one-sided t-test
  were used in the CD level analysis and relative ion leakage analysis, respectively
  (*, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001). Error bars indicate the standard deviations.
