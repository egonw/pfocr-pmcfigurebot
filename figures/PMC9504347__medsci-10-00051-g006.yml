caption: Polysome profile analysis of MCF-7 cells following treatment with DFMO and
  Rapamycin and the combination of both. Representative of polysome profiles of cells
  grown for 72 h with no treatment (top left), cells grown for 24 h followed by 5mM
  DFMO treatment for 48 h (top right), cells grown for 24 h followed by treatment
  with 0.1 µM rapamycin for 48 h (bottom left), and cells grown for 24 h followed
  by 5 mM DFMO plus 0.1 µM rapamycin treatment for 48 h (bottom right). Cells were
  harvested and processed for polysome analysis, (a) Images for each treatment shown
  is a representation for two independent experiments. (b) Estimation of polysome
  to monosome ratio from (a). Values shown are mean ± range for two independent experiments
  for all treatments.
