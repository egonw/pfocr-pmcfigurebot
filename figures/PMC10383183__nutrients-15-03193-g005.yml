caption: Effect of PBE on NF-κB activation in BMMs. BMMs were cultured with RANKL
  (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL), with or without PBE (50 μg/mL), for 5, 15, 30,
  and 60 min. (A) Protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using
  anti-NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα antibodies. (B) Image J software was
  used to quantify the protein bands. Bars labeled with different superscripts indicate
  significant differences (# p < 0.05 vs. RANKL non-treated group; ** p < 0.005 vs.
  control; *** p < 0.001 vs. control). Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments (n = 3).
