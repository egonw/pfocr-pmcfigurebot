caption: Schematic representation of putative interaction of DLM with JAK2/STAT1 signaling
  pathways. Schema illustrates the mechanism that DLM inhibits cell migration by suppressing
  the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway. DLM inhibited the phosphorylation (Tyr1007) and
  activation of JAK2 and then further inhibited the phosphorylation (Ser727) and activation
  of STAT1. These further induced the decrease of the downstream genes of STAT1, such
  as CXCL10, which participated in inflammation by promoting cell migration and ultimately
  resulted in the progression of TB.
