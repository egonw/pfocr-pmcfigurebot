caption: Alleviation of metabolic bottleneck in the conversion of dsBGLS to BGLS in
  the BGLSg strain. (A) Constructs for overexpression of SOT16, MET3, and MET14, and
  expression of APK1. The SOT16 gene and APK1 gene encoding A. thaliana APS kinase
  were constructed on plasmids pESC-HIS and pESC-URA-USER, respectively. The MET3
  and MET14 were constructed on plasmid pESC-HIS. Expression of all the genes was
  controlled by the terminator CYC1 and the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1, except
  expression of MET14 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter GAL10.
  (B) Yields of BGLS and dsBGLS from the BGLSg strain overexpressing SOT16 or MET3
  and MET14. The abbreviations Control, SOT16, and METs represent the BGLSg strain
  containing, respectively, the empty plasmid pESC-HIS, the construct with SOT16,
  and the construct with MET3 and MET14. The engineered strains were grown in SC-His-Gal
  medium, and samples were taken at 48 h. Statistical significance is shown based
  on Pairwise Tukey’s HSD test (P < 0.05), and data labeled with different letters
  are significantly different. Exact values for BGLS and dsBGLS yields and P values
  are listed in Table S1. (C) Yields of BGLS and dsBGLS from the BGLSg strain overexpressing
  APK1. Control and APK1 represent the BGLSg strain containing, respectively, the
  empty plasmid pESC-URA-USER and the construct with APK1. The engineered strains
  were grown in SC-Ura-Gal medium, and samples were taken at 48 h. Data represent
  the average and P values (two-sided Student's t test) of four biological replicates.
  The P value used to compare the BGLS yields produced by the control strain and the
  APK1 strain is 0.015 (indicated with *). Exact values for dsBGLS and BGLS yields
  are listed in Table S1.
