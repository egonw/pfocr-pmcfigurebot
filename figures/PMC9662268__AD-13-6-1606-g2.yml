caption: The activation process of the STING pathway. Under resting state, STIM1 binds
  to STING, suppressing its exit from ER, a critical step in STINGâ€™s initiation of
  downstream type I interferon signaling. TMEM203 binds to IP3R and STIM1 to maintain
  cellular calcium homeostasis. Under pathological conditions, overexpression of TMEM203
  leads to a depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores. The activation
  of TMEM203 directly promotes the dissociation of STING from STIM1, followed by the
  activation of the STING cascade. On the other hand, alteration of cellular calcium
  concentration indirectly activates the STING cascade. Firstly, the calcium store
  depletion induced by overexpression of TMEM203 facilitates the translocation of
  STIM1 and retains more STIM1 protein for binding to Orai1. Secondly, upon stimulation
  by mitochondrial damage generated dsDNA, and induced by elevated intracellular calcium
  concentration, cGAS utilizes ATP and GTP to synthesize cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Subsequently,
  cGAMP acts as a second messenger, diffusing and binding to STING, thus priming its
  translocation into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to recruit TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3, upon phosphorylation
  by TBK1, homo-dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus to induce transcription
  of type I IFNs, followed by the activation of the inflammatory cascade.
