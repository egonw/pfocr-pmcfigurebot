caption: 'Resveratrol protected the neural retina from alcohol damage by activating
  the PI3K‐AKT signalling pathway. (A) Counts per million of RNA sequencing were used
  to plot the expression levels of RELN, SGK1, FGFR2, MET and PIK3AP1. Each dot represents
  one sample. (B) The relative mRNA levels of RELN, SGK1, FGFR2, MET and PIK3AP1 between
  the EtOH group and RSV groups by unpaired Student''s t‐test, normalised by GAPDH.
  Error bars represent standard error of the mean. (C) Representative immunofluorescent
  images of organoid sections stained for KI67 (green) and CHX10 (red) in each group
  at 200× magnification. (D) Representative immunofluorescent images of organoid sections
  stained for PAX6 (green) and SOX2 (red) in each group at 200× magnification. (E)
  Representative immunofluorescent images of organoid sections stained for NESTIN
  (green) and TUJ1 (red) in each group at 200× magnification. (F) Comparison of positive
  cells among groups by one‐way ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni''s post hoc test (N = 9
  from three experiments). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scar bars:
  40 μm. Error bars represent standard deviations. EtOH, ethanol; RSV, resveratrol.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns, no significance.'
