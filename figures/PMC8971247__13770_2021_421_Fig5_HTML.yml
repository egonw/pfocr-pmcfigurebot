caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was involved in the intestinal differentiation
  of BMSCs in vitro. A The spindle-shaped BMSCs morphology changed to a polygonal,
  round-like IEC-6 morphology in transwell co-culture system. B–E Immunofluorescence
  was performed to exhibit CK and Villin expression in the co-culture system. Scale
  bars 100 μm; DAPI-blue, CK-green, Villin-green. The levels of CK and Villin were
  increased in the BMSCs + IEC-6 group than in the BMSCs + BMSCs group. F AKT, mTOR,
  CK, and Villin protein expressions in different co-culture systems measured by Western
  blotting. G–J The expressions of CK and Villin decreased greatly when blocking the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. PI3K, phosphoinositide kinase-3; AKT, protein kinase
  B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin
