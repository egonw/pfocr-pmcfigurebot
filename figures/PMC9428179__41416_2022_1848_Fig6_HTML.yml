figure_title: Metabolic response to AZD3965 in combination with IACS-010759 in vivo
caption: NSG mice-bearing subcutaneous DLBCL xenografts were treated with AZD3965
  (100 mg/kg) ± IACS-010759 (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle and tumours collected 6 h following
  AZD3965, 4 h post IACS-010759. a Metabolite abundance expressed as log2 fold change
  versus vehicle-treated controls. Metabolites were significantly altered in at least
  one group as assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons.
  b pathway enrichment score using significantly altered metabolites observed in 1
  or more DLBCL xenografts.
