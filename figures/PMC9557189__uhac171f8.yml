caption: A hypothetical model of the role of MdPUB23 in cold-stress response. MdPUB23
  degraded the MdICE1 protein through the ubiquitination pathway and reduced cold
  resistance. Under cold-stress conditions, MdPUB23 was inhibited and the MdICE1 protein
  was released from the MdPUB23–MdICE1 ubiquitin module. MdICE1 enhanced cold resistance
  through the ICE1–CBF–COR pathway.

  by degrading the cold-stress regulatory protein MdICE1.
