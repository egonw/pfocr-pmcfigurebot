caption: mTORC1 regulates GCN2 activity postactivation.A, time-dependent GCN2 pathway
  analysis of torin-1 on GCN2 activation. 3T3 cells were starved for Leu for 1 h or
  4 h in the absence or presence of GCN2-IN-6 (10 μM), rapamycin (1 μM), everolimus,
  (1 μM), and torin-1 (1 μM). Lysates were probed for activation of GCN2 (p-GCN2 T898),
  total GCN2, ATF4 as a marker of the ISR or p-4EBP1. GRB2 was used as a loading control.
  Note that torin-1 does not inhibit p-GCN2 or ATF4 at 1 h. B, 3T3 cells were cultured
  in Leu-free media for the times indicated in the absence of presence of torin-1
  (100 nM). The GRB2 loading control indicates the expected time-dependent decline
  in total protein amounts in the lysates over the 24 h starvation period. C, quantification
  of the inhibitory effect of RapaLink-1 (10 μM) in Ddti3::mCherry 3T3 cells upon
  L-leu starvation compared with rapamycin (1 μM) and sapanisertib (10 μM). Data are
  depicted as mean ± SEM of three technical replicates and represent one of two independent
  experiments. D, pathway immunoblotting analysis of the effects of RapaLink-1 compared
  to its parent inhibitors (rapamycin and sapanisertib) using Leu-starved 3T3 cells
  for 4 h. Data are representative of three independent experiments. ISR, integrated
  stress response.
