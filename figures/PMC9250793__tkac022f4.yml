caption: Mechanism of hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. When there is no HH, patched
  (PTCH) will inhibit the activity of smoothened (Smo), leading to the termination
  of transcription of downstream target gene. When SHH is present, PTCH binds to SHH,
  releasing Smo and allowing the glioma (Gli) protein and protein kinase A (PKA) to
  form a macromolecular complex, such that the full-length Gli protein enters the
  nucleus to initiate transcription of downstream target genes
