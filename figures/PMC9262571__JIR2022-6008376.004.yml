caption: 'MS prevents excessive inflammatory response by stimulating Treg proliferation
  antagonized by anti-CD25 treatment. A representative flow cytometry plot indicates
  the Treg cell percentage in one lung (a) which is graphically presented in (b).
  IL-10 mRNA expression in the lungs by anti-CD25 antibody was analyzed (c). The data
  are presented in the form of the mean ± SEM (n = 6 per group). ∗ and ∗∗∗ denote
  P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively, versus control group; ## denote P < 0.01,
  respectively, versus asthma group; △△△ denotes P < 0.001, respectively, versus asthma-MS
  group.'
