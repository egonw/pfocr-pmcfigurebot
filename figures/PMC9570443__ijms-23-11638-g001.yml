caption: 'Pathways of pyroptosis. (a) Classical pyroptosis pathway mediated by caspase-1;
  (b) nonclassical pyroptosis pathway mediated by caspase-4/5/11; (c) pyroptosis pathway
  mediated by GSDME as the executing protein; (d) pyroptosis pathway mediated by caspase-8.
  The classical pyroptosis pathway involves two steps: initiation and activation.
  TLRs are Toll-Like Receptors. MyD88 is myeloid differentiation factor 88. NF-κB
  is nuclear factor-kappa B. PAMPs are pathogen-associated molecular patterns. DAMPs
  are damage-associated molecular patterns. ASC is speck-like protein containing a
  CARD. Caspase is cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase. GSDMD is Gasdermin D.
  IL-1β is interleukin-1β. IL-18 is interleukin-18. LPS is lipopolysaccharide. GSDME
  is Gasdermin E. RIPK1 is receptor-interacting protein kinase 1. TAK1 is transforming
  growth factor β-activated kinase 1.'
