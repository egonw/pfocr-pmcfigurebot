figure_title: TIPE1 specifically inhibits STAT3 expression
caption: 'Volcano plot A, Heatmap B and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis C showed that TIPE1
  overexpression inhibited the STAT3 signaling pathway. D, E Western blotting assay
  showed that overexpression of TIPE1 specifically decreased total STAT3 and p-STAT3
  levels in MNNG/HOS Cl #5 cells, while knockdown of TIPE1 expression increased total
  STAT3 and p-STAT3 expression in MG63 cells. F Immunofluorescence analysis suggested
  that overexpression of TIPE1 reduced the expression of total STAT3 and p-STAT3 in
  MNNG/HOS Cl #5 cells. The data represent the means ± SDs of 3 replicates.'
