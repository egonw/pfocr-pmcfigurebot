figure_title: Genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens identify specific polycomb and KMT2complex
  components regulating bivalent gene activation
caption: (a) Schematic view of CRISPR screens to identify regulators that either enhance
  or restrict cytokine induced MHC-I expression. K-562 cells were mutagenised by infection
  with a genome-scale pooled lentiviral library comprising 220,000 sgRNA. Cells were
  pulsed with 1ng/mL or 25ng/mL IFN-γ for 24h prior to enrichment of MHC-I high or
  low cells by two-rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). (b & c) Bubble
  plots show top 100 enriched genes identified in MHC-I high CRISPR screens. PRC2
  complex highlighted in pink, PRC1 in purple and the KMT2A/KMT2B complex in green.
  p-values calculated using the RSA algorithm. (d) Schematic depicting complexes identified
  in CRISPR screens. KMT2A/B complex (MEN1, PSIP1/LEDGF), PRC2.1 (EED, EZH2, SUZ12,
  MTF2) and PRC1.1 (PCGF1). (e) EED and EZH2 co-dependent genes derived from CERES
  gene effect scores in combined CRISPR survival screens in 990 cancer cell lines
  in Cancer Dependency Map (https://depmap.org/portal/),. Plot displays correlation
  between CRISPR gene effect scores for indicated genes with CRISPR gene effect scores
  for EZH2 and EED (Pearson correlation coefficient). Genes highlighted correspond
  with hits identified in our CRISPR screen. (f) Bubble plot shows top 100 enriched
  genes identified in MHC-I low CRISPR screen. Genes highlighted in orange are known
  components of the interferon response pathway and MHC-I antigen processing pathway,
  in purple are transcription factors and enhanceosome components driving MHC-I expression,
  and pink, AEBP2, a PRC2.2 component. p-values calculated using the RSA algorithm.
  (g & h) K-562 Cas9 cells transduced with indicated sgRNA and treated with 10ng/mL
  IFN-γ for (g) 24h or (h) 36h. Cell surface MHC-I from a representative experiment
  (left). Bars (right) show mean fold change in median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
  from 3 experiments, indicated by points. Unpaired two-tailed t-test, p-values are
  (g) p=0.0041 and (h) p<0.0001. (i & j) H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 CUT&Tag in K-562 cells
  transduced with control, MTF2 or AEBP2 sgRNA. (i) Genomic snapshot of bivalent MHC-I
  gene, HLA-B. (j) Heatmaps show bivalent genes -3kb TSS/ +3kb TES. Genomic regions
  ordered by H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 read density in control samples.
