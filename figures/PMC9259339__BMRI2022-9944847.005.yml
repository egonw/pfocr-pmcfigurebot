caption: 'CD73 binds to EGFR to activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in vitro.
  (a) Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the interaction between CD73 and EGFR
  in the A549 cell line. (b) Representative western blots of p-EGFR, EGFR, p-AKT,
  AKT, p-mTOR, and mTOR in the A549 cells following transfection with siRNA or overexpression
  plasmid or treated with APCP. The ratio of (c) p-EGFR/EGFR, (d) p-AKT/AKT, and (e)
  p-mTOR/mTOR in the A549 cells following transfection with siRNA, overexpression
  plasmid, or treatment with APCP. Each experiment was performed three times. The
  data are presented as the mean Â± SD. &P < 0.05 between two groups. LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma;
  si: small interfering; p: phosphorylated.'
