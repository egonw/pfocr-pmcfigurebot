caption: JNK pathway is crucial for expansion and stemness of human colorectal cancer
  (CRC) cells in the context of BRG1 suppression. (A) Kaplan–Meier analysis of CRC
  patients between the c‐JUN high and low expression groups (p = 0.653). (B) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis of CRC patients with low BRG1 expression between the c‐JUN high and low
  expression groups (p = 0.0131). (C) Kaplan–Meier analysis of CRC patients between
  p‐c‐JUN positive and p‐c‐JUN negative expression groups (p = 0.825). Analyzed by
  log–rank test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
