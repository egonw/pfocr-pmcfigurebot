caption: 'Adropin inhibits JAK2/STAT3 activation in osteogenic differentiated VSMCs
  in vitro. (a) The activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in VSMCs was quantified
  using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control. (b) Reverse-transcription
  quantitative PCR was carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of adropin knockdown
  and overexpression in VSMCs. GAPDH was used as the loading control. (c) The phosphorylation
  of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in VSMCs. Each experiment was performed three
  times, and data are presented as the mean ± SD. JAK2: tyrosine protein kinase JAK2;
  STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; VSMCs: vascular smooth
  muscle cells. ∗p < 0.05 compared to control. #p < 0.05 compared to the Cacl2 group.'
