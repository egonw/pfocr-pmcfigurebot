caption: 'Knockdown of NT5DC2 induces diffuse large B-cell carcinoma cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis. (A) Cell cycle distribution of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2
  was detected by flow cytometry. (B) Expression levels of cell cycle-associated proteins
  were analyzed by western blotting. (C) Apoptosis of OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with
  shRNA-NT5DC2 was detected by flow cytometry. (D) Expression levels of apoptosis-associated
  proteins were analyzed by western blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs.
  Control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC. NT5DC2, 5′-nucleotidase domain-containing
  2; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control; cyto-c, cytochrome c; PARP, poly-ADP
  ribose polymerase.'
article_title: Decreased RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 downregulates NT5DC2, which suppresses
  cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the p53 signaling pathway.
