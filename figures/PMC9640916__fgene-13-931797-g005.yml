caption: 'Construction of ceRNA networks of the hair follicle cycle and identification
  of novel alopecia-related target genes. (A) Construction of ceRNA networks in the
  murine hair follicle cycle based on the identified and PCR-validated genes. (B)
  GO biological processes enrichment analysis of target mRNAs in the ceRNA networks.
  (C) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of target mRNAs in the ceRNA networks.
  (D,E) The expression of target genes GSPT1 and MITF in AGA patients and healthy
  individuals. (F–H) The expression of target genes GSPT1, lncRNA TUG1, and lncRNA
  NEAT1 between bald and haired groups in AGA patients. (I–N) GSPT1 immunostaining
  (brown) with blue purple nuclear counterstain in the scalp tissue of healthy individuals
  (I–L) and the bald scalp of patients with AGA (M,N). Anagen follicles of healthy
  scalp have strong staining for GSPT1 in hair matrix and IRS, medium level in ORS,
  and low/undetectable staining in the bulge region: DP and CTS. Low GSPT1 expression
  was observed in upper IRS and ORS of miniaturized hair follicles from the AGA scalp.
  Scale bars, 50 μm ns, p ≥ 0.05; *, p < 0.05.'
