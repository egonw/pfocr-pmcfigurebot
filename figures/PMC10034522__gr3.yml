caption: Different modalities of multifunctional aptamers based CSC-targeted therapeutic
  strategies. (A) Multifunctional aptamer-based CSC-targeted therapeutic strategies
  containing a single aptamer and other kinds of targeting ligands can simultaneously
  bind to CSCs and non-CSCs. Reprinted with the permission from Ref. []. (B) The use
  of aptamers as targeting ligands to co-target non-CSCs and CSCs for photothermal
  therapy. (C) An example of the application of ApDCs to deliver two drugs to CSCs.
  In response to Apt-NPs, the SOX2-CD133, CD133-Wnt/β-catenin, and CD44-Wnt/β-catenin
  axes were downregulated and the expression of autophagy genes, such as LAMP1, INFG,
  and BECN1, were inhibited. Drug-loaded Apt-NPs could reverse drug resistance in
  GSCs via downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy genes. (D) Multifunctional
  aptamer-based therapeutics target CSC pathways and thereby inhibit the proliferation
  of tumors. Reprinted with the permission from Ref. [].
