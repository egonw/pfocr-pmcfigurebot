figure_title: The association between high AR expression and cell cycle pathway activation
caption: scRNAseq was performed on untreated MDA-MB-453 cells cultured in full serum
  media. Cells were divided into groups based on their expression of AR, ARLow and
  ARHigh. (A) Histogram of the distribution of AR expression in single MDA-MB-453
  cells including AR level group determination. (B) Ingenuity pathway analysis was
  performed on genes differentially expressed between ARLow and ARHigh groups. Shown
  are the top 15 most significantly altered disease and function pathways. (C) Differential
  expression of genes involved in cell cycle indicating cell cycle activation associated
  with high AR expression, shown as 10 cell aggregates.
