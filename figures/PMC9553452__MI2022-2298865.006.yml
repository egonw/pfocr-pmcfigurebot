caption: CEBPB regulated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in glomerular podocytes
  via the regulation of Pim-1. The mRNA expression level of Pim-1 in CEBPB knockdown
  podocytes (a); the binding of Pim-1 promoter and CEBPB detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (b) and dual-luciferase reporter assay (c); the transfect efficiency of Pim-1 overexpression
  (d); the content of IL-1β (e) and IL-6 (f) in the cell supernatant; Protein expression
  of key proteins in the inflammasome-related signaling pathway (g, h). (CEBPB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein β).
