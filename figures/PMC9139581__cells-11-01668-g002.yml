caption: Distinct genes and biological processes are altered in advanced and non-advanced
  retinoblastoma. (A) Heatmap showing significantly differentially expressed genes
  identified four main gene groups in advanced (n = 5) and non-advanced Rb (n = 4),
  compared to pediatric retina controls (n = 2). Genes were grouped based on the pathways
  reported in GOBP. Results are represented as a network of enriched genes sets (nodes)
  connected to their overlapping pathways (edges). The node size is proportional to
  the total number of genes in the gene set of interest. (B) Gene group 1 represents
  an enriched cluster of genes in the cell cycle, and the DNA damage and response
  pathway. (C) List of functional pathways regulated by the gene sets in Group 1.
  (D) Gene group 2 represents an enriched group of genes belonging to transcriptional
  regulation, immune system regulation, and epigenetic factors. (E) List of functional
  pathways regulated by the gene sets in group 2. (F) Gene group 3 represents an enriched
  set of genes belonging to cellular metabolic processes such as glycolysis, Krebs
  cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. (G) List of functional pathways regulated by the
  gene sets in group 3.
