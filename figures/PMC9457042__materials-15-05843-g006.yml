caption: 'Western blot analysis of integrin α5, integrin β1, β-catenin, PAN-cadherin,
  and FAK after GN and rGO treatment at 25 µg/mL concentration for 24 h in U87 and
  Hs5 cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Abbreviations: rGO, reduced graphene
  oxide; GN, graphene; C, control group (untreated group); ExF, exfoliation; term,
  thermal; ATS, ammonium thiosulfate; TUD, thiourea dioxide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
