caption: 'The mediatory functions of CDs on oxidative stress-related genes and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. A Oxidative stress-related genes was verified to be modulated by CDs.
  B CDs exerted its mediatory roles in oxidative stress-induced cartilage injury through
  targeting Nrf2 signaling pathway. C Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by IL-1β was
  rescued by CDs incubation. Scar bar: 40 μm **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001'
