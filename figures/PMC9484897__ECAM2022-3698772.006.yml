caption: 'Effect of inhibiting ROS/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway on migration and
  invasion in REA-treated EC cells. (a) Eca109 and KYSE150 cells migration; (b) number
  of membrane piercing in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (c) results of Eca109 and KYSE150
  cells scratch assay (scale bar, 100 μm); (d) Transwell invasion assay of Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells (crystal violet staining, 400x, Scale bar, 50 μm); (e) protein
  band calculated as a ratio relative to β-actin protein levels; (f) relative protein
  expression of ASK1, p38 MAPK, and p-p38 MAPK; (g) relative protein expression of
  E-cadherin, Slug, and N-cadherin. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared
  with the control group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01; compared with the 2IC50 group,
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01; compared with the shRNA-ASK1 group, ΔP < 0.05 and ΔΔP
  < 0.01; compared with the SB203580 group, ▲P<0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01.'
