  Cbk1 is critical for CO2 tolerance
caption: (A). The clinical reference strain H99 and environmental strains A7-35-23
  and A1-38-2 were grown overnight in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD), serially diluted,
  and spotted onto solid YPD media plates. Photographs were taken 2 days after incubation
  in the indicated condition. (B) This serial dilution spotting assay was similarly
  performed for H99 and the mutants indicated. Two independent overexpression transformants
  for each mutant background were included as biological replicates. (C) Heatmap showing
  normalized total RNA counts of NanoString targets in H99 and cbk1Δ cultured at either
  ambient or 5% CO2, red indicates higher and blue indicates lower transcript abundance.
  (D) Volcano plot showing significantly differentially expressed transcripts (p-value
  of <0.05) in the cbk1Δ compared to H99 in the 5% CO2 condition. (E) Serial dilution
  spotting assay of H99 and four of the mutants found in the deletion set screening
  to be CO2 sensitive which also correspond to significantly downregulated genes shown
  in the volcano plot.
