caption: 'CENPM promotes cell proliferation, causes cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase,
  enhances cell migration and invasion capacity, promotes apoptosis in LUAD cell lines
  via regulation of AKT1/mTOR pathway. (A) LY294002 treatment inhibited H292 cell
  proliferation compared with oeCENPM treatment, measured through CCK-8. (B,C) LY294002
  treatment decreased H292 cells G0/G1 phase while increased G2/M phase of cell cycle
  compared with oeCENPM treatment, as measured by flow cytometer. (D,E) LY294002 treatment
  inhibited H292 cell migration and invasion capacity compared with oeCENPM treatment,
  as determined through Transwell assay (crystal violet staining). (F) LY294002 treatment
  promoted H292 cell apoptosis compared with oeCENPM treatment, as measured by flow
  cytometer. Bars indicate the means Â± SD. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ****, P<0.0001.
