figure_title: IRGM1 mediates the impaired proliferation and Paneth cell function caused
  by Cul4b deletion
caption: a, b Relative mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides cryptdin (Defa1), Defa4,
  Defa5, cathelicidin (Camp), Defa6, and lysozyme (Lyz) in WT + NC, KOIEC infected
  by lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1) and KOIEC control organoids (KOIEC + NC).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. c. The average number of Paneth
  cells within individual buds (right) from WT + NC, KOIEC + shIrgm1 and KOIEC + NC.
  ****P < 0.0001. d Representative image the organoids (left) of WT (WT + NC), KOIEC
  infected by lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1) and control (KOIEC + NC).
  The average budding number per organoid (right) from WT + NC, KOIEC + shIrgm1 and
  KOIEC + NC. The scale bar is 200 μm. ****P < 0.0001. e The organoids numbers of
  WT (WT + NC), KOIEC infected by lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1)
  and control (KOIEC + NC). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. f Representative image of Ki67
  staining from organoids of WT (WT + NC), KOIEC infected by lentivirus to knockdown
  Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1) and control (KOIEC + NC). The scale bar is 15 μm. g Relative
  mRNA levels of stem cell marker Lgr5 (Left) and Sox9 (Right) in organoids of WT + NC,
  KOIEC infected by dose-dependent lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1)
  and control (KOIEC + NC). The experiment was performed with triplicates. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, ns, no significance. h Relative luciferase activity
  of HEK293 STF Wnt activity reporter lines were detected after 48 h treated with
  secreted supernatant collected from organoids WT + NC, KOIEC infected by dose-dependent
  lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1) and control (KOIEC + NC). ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001. i Relative mRNA levels of Wnt target gene in organoids of WT (WT + NC),
  KOIEC infected by lentivirus to knockdown Irgm1 (KOIEC + shIrgm1) and control (KOIEC + NC).
  The experiment was performed with triplicates. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001,
  ns, no significance. j Protein level of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was determined by
  Western blot in SI organoids from KOIEC, KOIEC with Irgm1 ablation (KOIEC + shIrgm1)
  and WT (WT + NC) mice.
