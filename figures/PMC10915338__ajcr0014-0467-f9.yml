caption: 'Expression of hypoxic response in endometrial TCAFs derived from patients:
  Expression of hypoxia-induced HIF-1a, HIF-2a, VEGF, and MMP1 are presented (A).
  A heatmap of ratios of hypoxic to normoxic expression of signaling proteins of HIF-signaling,
  as well as a few growth factors, immune markers, steroid receptors, and Wnt-beta-catenin
  pathway proteins, are presented (B).'
