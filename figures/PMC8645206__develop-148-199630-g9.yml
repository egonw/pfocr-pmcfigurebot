caption: Summary of the functions of Ben and JNK pathway genes in the FSC lineage.
  Ben positively regulates JNK signaling in the FSC lineage. JNK signaling downregulates
  the EGFR signaling reporter pERK and may promote Notch signaling in pFCs. In a JNK-independent
  manner, ben downregulates Hh signaling in pFCs. Schematics depict signaling pathway
  activity profiles in region 2a (2a), FSCs, Region 2b (2b), region 3 (3), polar (P)
  and stalk (S) cells in the FSC lineage. In schematics for each genotype, an increase
  or decrease in reporter signal (black line) is represented. pERK is detectable in
  ECs in Region 2a and FSCs at the 2a/b border, but is undetectable in early pFCs.
  NRE-GFP, a reporter for Notch signaling, is first detected along the 2a/b border,
  and then detected in mature polar cell clusters. Ptc-pelican-GFP, a reporter for
  Hh signaling activity, gradually decreases from ECs in Region 2a to early pFCs in
  Region 2b. Loss of JNK signaling leads to delays in differentiation and results
  in pFC differentiation defects. Loss of ben also leads to perdurance of Hh signaling
  beyond region 2b contributing to defects in differentiation and proliferation. Increased
  proliferation in ben mutants leads to FSC hypercompetition.
