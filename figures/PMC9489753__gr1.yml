caption: Activation, expansion, and differentiation of LPLCs. During chronic liver
  injuries, dying hepatocytes generate Hh ligands, which not only directly activate
  LPLC-induced liver regeneration but also indirectly enhance the proliferation of
  LPLCs by activating HSCs into matrix-producing myofibroblasts. Also, LTβR on HSCs
  (activated via HIPPO/YAP pathway) may be involved in paracrine signaling with nearby
  LTβ-expressing LPLCs. After initiation, TWEAK has a selective mitogenic effect for
  LPLCs, stimulating the proliferation of LPLCs through its receptor Fn14. The stimulation
  of TWEAK will lead to the activation of NF-κB and proliferation of LPLCs. FGF not
  only activates the proliferation of LPLCs (FGF7) but also induces the differentiation
  of LPLCs into hepatocytes (FGF9). HGF/c-met signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
  and thyroid hormone signaling are all proved to promote the differentiation of LPLCs
  into MHs, whereas Jag1/Notch signaling can induce LPLCs differentiating into BECs.
