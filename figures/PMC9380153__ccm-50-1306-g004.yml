caption: Malesâ€™ renin-angiotensin system (RAS) component levels compared with those
  of females hospitalized with COVID-19 at baseline (day 0), day 2, 4, 7, and 14.
  A, Baseline adjusted median difference in RAS component levels males versus females
  based on quantile regression adjusting for age, chronic cardiac disease, chronic
  kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension (n = 46). B, Comparison of RAS component
  levels between sexes over time based on adjusted quantile regression (day 0) and
  linear quantile mixed regression (day 2 and onward; unable to adjust for other variables
  due to small sample size). ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme.
