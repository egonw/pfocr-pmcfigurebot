caption: miR‐324‐5p activates the TGFBR1/smad3 signaling pathway. Schematic diagram
  of TGFBR1 with the predicted binding site for miR‐324‐5p. B, Luciferase reporter
  analysis was carried out to examine the binding ability between miR‐324‐5p and TGFBR1.
  Reporter constructs containing either TGFBR1wt or TGFBR1mut at the predicted binding
  site for miR‐324‐5p were cotransfected into T cells with miR‐324‐5p or miR‐NC mimic.
  C, D, Western blots and grey value of TGFBR1 expression in T cells after being transfected
  with miR‐324‐5p inhibitor or miR‐NC. E, F, Western blots and grey value of TGFBR1,
  Smad3, and FOXP3 expression in T cells after being transfected with TGFBR1 siRNA.
  G, H, Western blots and grey value of TGFBR1, Smad3, and FOXP3 expression in T cells
  after treatment with Huh7‐derived exosomes (Exo‐Huh7), miR‐324‐5p mimics, or miR‐NC.
  I, J, Western blots and grey value of TGFBR1, Smad3, and FOXP3 expression in T cells
  after treatment with HepG2‐derived exosomes (Exo‐HepG2), miR‐324‐5p mimics, or miR‐NC.
  All data are means ± SD; n = 3, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
