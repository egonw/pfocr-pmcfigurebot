caption: Tri-omics analysis of significant changes in the cardiac transcriptome, metabolome
  and proteome changes in during pregnancy. ANOVA analysis was performed to identify
  significantly expressed cardiac transcripts, metabolites and protein abundances
  [P <0.05; false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05] across all time points [nonpregnant,
  diestrus (NP), midpregnant (MP; day 8 of pregnancy), late pregnant (LP; day 16 of
  pregnancy), and 1 wk postbirth with lactation (PB)]. Official gene names and Human
  Metabolome Database (HMDB) and Uniprot IDs of those significantly expressed targets
  were added to the tri-omics analysis software OmicsNet. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed to analyze significantly impacted
  pathways using KEGG gene + metabolite (G+M; A), KEGG gene (B), and KEGG metabolite
  (C).
