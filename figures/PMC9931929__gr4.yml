caption: 'Identification of VPS35 binding to EGFR. (a) Gene Ontology pathway enrichment
  analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MKN28/Ctrl
  and MKN28/shVPS35 cells revealed by RNA-Seq. (three biological replicates, transcriptomic
  data were submitted to the GEO database (GSE210320). (b) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of significantly DEGs (Fisher''s exact tests). (c) A pairwise correlation
  of RNA expression of VPS35 with MAPK-associated genes of receptor components (i.e.,
  EGFR, VEGFR2, MET, and FGFR3) from TCGA gastric cancer cohort. Left triangle: a
  colour plot for the expression of two molecules showing different correlation by
  colours; diagonal: the name for each molecule; and right triangle: correlation coefficient.
  (d) Correlation of RNA expression of VPS35 with several related genes from the GEPIA
  gastric cancer cohort (Spearman''s correlation). (e) Flow cytometry analysis for
  AGS/Ctrl, AGS/shVPS35, MKN28/Ctrl, MKN28/shVPS35, HGC27/Ctrl, HGC27/VPS35, HS-746T/Ctrl,
  and HS-746T/VPS35 cells. Compared with cells in the control groups, AGS/shVPS35
  and MKN28/shVPS35 cells had a significantly decreased EGFR fluorescence density
  (left two panels), while HGC27/VPS35 and HS-746T/VPS35 cells had a significantly
  increased EGFR fluorescence density (right two panels). Experiments were conducted
  three times independently. (f) Correlation of EGFR and VPS35 expression levels by
  linking IHC scores of EGFR to VPS35 in paired patient samples (Pearson''s correlation).
  (g) Different binding proteins derived from immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
  (IP-MS) of MKN28 cells. (h) Interaction of VPS35 with EGFR determined by co-Immunoprecipitation
  (Co-IP) assays in MKN28 cells. (The student''s t tests, ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗, p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001.).'
