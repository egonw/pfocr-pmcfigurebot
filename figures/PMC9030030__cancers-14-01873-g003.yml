caption: 'Schematic representation of the possible inhibitory points in the FLT3 signaling
  pathway. Type II FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib act in the inactivated FLT3 receptor
  (represented as an FLT3 monomer). Active FLT3 transduces signaling through (1) the
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which, in turn, can be inhibited by pan- or specific MEK
  inhibitors; (2) the PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is also inactivated by specific
  mTOR inhibitors; and (3) JAK/STAT signaling, which might also be inhibited by the
  specific JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. In addition, venetoclax can block the anti-apoptotic
  signaling effects of Bcl-2. MEK, mTOR, JAK, and Bcl-2 inhibitors can also be used
  in any T-ALL cases showing activation of the target proteins. TMD: transmembrane
  domain; ICD: intracellular domain; TKID-I and II: tyrosine kinase domain I and II;
  Sor: sorafenib; Rux: ruxolitinib; Ven: venetoclax. Created with BioRender.com, accessed
