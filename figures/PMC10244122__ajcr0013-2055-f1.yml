caption: DSF combined with immunochemotherapy elevates antitumor efficacy. Tumor volume
  (A) and tumor mass (B) of the PAN02 cell-derived tumors (n = 8 per group). (C) The
  survival of mice bearing PAN02 tumors following treatment with chemotherapy and/or
  anti-PD-1 antibody (n = 8 per group). (D) The composition of immune cells in tumor
  tissues analyzed by flow cytometry. (E-G) Tumor volume, tumor mass, and the survival
  of mice bearing PAN02 tumors treated by DSF (50 mg/kg) and/or immunochemotherapy
  (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, NS indicates no significance).
