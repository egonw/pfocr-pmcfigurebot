caption: 'ReA inhibits TRAF6/MAPK signaling pathway activated by IL-17A stimulation
  in HaCaT cells. (A) Western blot images of TRAF6/MAPK signaling pathway-related
  proteins. (B) Statistical results of TRAF6/MAPK signaling pathway-related protein
  levels in cells of Control group, ReA group, IL-17A group, and IL-17A+ReA group.
  **P < 0.01, vs Control group; ##P < 0.01, vs IL-17A group. Three experiments were
  repeated.'
