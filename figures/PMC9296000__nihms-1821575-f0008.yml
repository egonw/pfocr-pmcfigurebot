figure_title: Disruption of metabolic signaling pathways of the ileum
caption: (A) Schematic representation of expression levels of GLP-1 signaling pathway
  genes.(B) Plasma active GLP-1 (aGLP-1) levels in mice fed HFD under FA or FT conditions.(C)
  Ratios of unconjugated to conjugated bile acids in light and dark phases for each
  condition.(D) Schematic representation of expression levels of bile acid signaling
  pathway genes.(E) Serum cholesterol levels under different feeding conditions. Transcript
  levels are expressed as TPM. Please see  for figures with y axis measures. NA =
  blue, FA = red, FT = green. Three mice per time point were used for each condition,
  for a total of NA (n = 18), FA (n = 18), FT (n = 18) in (A) and (B). Shading areas
  show standard error of mean (SEM).
