caption: Breast cancer recurrence and metastasis after radiotherapy is related to
  the upregulation of the TGF-β signaling and vactosertib inhibits breast cancer metastasis
  to the lung. (A) Snapshot of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results based on
  gene-expression profile from the Kreike dataset. The GSEA results showing as enrichment
  plots suggested that breast cancer recurrence after radiotherapy was significantly
  correlated with upregulation of the TGF-β pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition-related gene sets. (B) Scheme of the experimental mouse model of breast
  cancer for radiotherapy (4T1-Luc allografted BALB/c syngeneic mice) and GSEA results
  based on the gene expression profile from the microarray analysis of the breast
  cancer mouse model. Mice were injected with 4T1-Luc cells and then divided randomly
  into two groups (control group and radiotherapy group) when the tumor volume reached
  70–100 mm3. The control group received no treatment and the radiotherapy group received
  whole body irradiation with 4 Gy/day for three days. At 14 days after the first
  day of radiotherapy, mice were euthanized and breast tumor samples were obtained
  from each group to perform the microarray analysis. GSEA results based on gene expression
  profile from the microarray analysis showed that TGF-β signaling– related genes
  were considerably upregulated in the radiotherapy group. (C) Changes in tumor weight
  in the radiation group and in the radiation and vactosertib combination therapy
  group compared to the control group. The weight of the tumor in each group was calculated
  as the relative organ weight to the mouse body weight. (D) Vactosertib inhibited
  breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Inhibition of lung metastasis by vactosertib
  was evaluated by the number of metastatic nodules in lung using India ink staining.
