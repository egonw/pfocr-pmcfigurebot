caption: 'Overview of substances that expand HSCs in vitro. Substances can be classified
  into 3 categories based on their action on HSC expansion: act by biologic molecules,
  act on surface phenotype (CD34+), and act on signaling pathway. Biologic molecules
  act by producing bioactivators to create necessary substances to expand HSCs. CD34+
  is the typical phenotype that stimulates HSC expansion. The signaling pathway has
  been previously discussed.'
