figure_title: Classification of protein acetylation
caption: According to protein substrates undergoing acetylation modification, protein
  acetylation can be classified into histone acetylation and non-histone acetylation.
  Based upon the amino acid being acetylated, it can be grouped into N-terminal acetylation
  and lysine acetylation.
