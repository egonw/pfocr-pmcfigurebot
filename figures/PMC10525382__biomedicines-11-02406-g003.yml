caption: Acquisition of resistance to erlotinib alters the proteome and kinome of
  MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells with minimal change to the phosphoproteome. SILAC-labeled
  TNBC cells, including erlotinib-resistant (468LR) versus erlotinib-sensitive (468S)
  cells, were treated with erlotinib (5 µM) or DMSO vehicle control for 24 h before
  being subjected to LC-MS/MS, as described in Materials and Methods. (A) Euler diagrams
  of the overlap of proteins quantified from proteomic (n = 2159), kinomic (n = 879),
  and phosphoproteomic (number of proteins with quantified phosphosite = 555) with
  significant overlap among the three datasets. (B–D) Volcano plots for quantified
  proteins from the (B) kinome, (C) proteome, and (D) phosphoproteome showing significantly
  altered proteins or phosphosites in the 468LR versus 468S cell models. (E) The plot
  of phosphorylation sites versus protein abundance to assess whether protein abundance
  biases respective phosphorylation changes. (F) Quantification and distribution of
  phosphorylation sites identified.
