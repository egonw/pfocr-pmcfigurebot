caption: 'Inhibition of TLR9 increased survival and improved cortical pathology in
  SAE rats. (A) Survival rate. n = 30. ∗P < 0.05. (B) At 24 h after CLP, cortical
  pathological changes were observed by H&E staining. Scale bar = 100 μm. n = 5. All
  experiments were repeated three times and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation.
  CLP: Cecal ligation and perforation; H&E: Hematoxylin and eosin; SAE: Sepsis associated
  encephalopathy; TLR9: Toll-like receptor 9.'
article_title: A new cell death program regulated by toll-like receptor 9 through
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in a neonatal rat model with
  sepsis associated encephalopathy.
