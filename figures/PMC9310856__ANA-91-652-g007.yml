caption: 'Metabolic alterations in MS astrocytes. A. PCA scores plot of the samples
  in the reverse phase mode. B. PCA scores plot of the samples in the HILIC mode.
  Quality control (QC) samples were included in the PCA analyses to ensure that no
  batch variations were present in the experiments. C. Heatmap representing all 16
  metabolites that were significantly different between groups (VIP score >1.0 and
  p‐value <0.05) in the reverse phase mode. D. Heatmap representing all four metabolites
  that were significantly different between groups (VIP score > 1.0 and p‐value < 0.05)
  in the HILIC mode. The heatmaps are presented in a row Z‐score scale in which red
  indicates metabolites with enhanced concentration levels and blue indicates metabolites
  with reduced concentration levels. (E,F) Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis on the
  metabolites with enhanced concentration levels in MS astrocytes (E) and the metabolites
  with reduced concentration levels in MS astrocytes (F). The analysis was performed
  using the KEGG human metabolite database as a source and the colors are scaled by
  the p‐value. G. Quantification of glutamate concentrations in control and MS astrocytes,
  **p < 0.01. Data preprocessing, statistical analysis and visualization were performed
  using MetaboAnalyst software and R programming language. Peak detection, deconvolution,
  alignment, identification, compound annotation and background subtraction was performed
  using the MS‐Dial software. Compound annotation was performed using LipidBlast and
  MassBank of North America library for polar metabolites and manually curated to
  prevent false positives/negatives and only metabolites with a similarity score higher
  than 70% were selected. After preprocessing, the data were normalized using LOWESS
  normalization on MS‐Dial and the normalized data were exported for statistical analysis.
  A relative standard deviation cutoff of 30% was applied on the dataset, followed
  by log2 transformation and autoscaling. ‘Barplot’, ‘heatmap.2’ and ‘gplot’ libraries
  and packages were used for data visualization. To observe the differential metabolites
  between control and MS samples, variable selection methods were applied. Each dataset
  was subjected to t‐test and PLS‐DA VIP score analysis using the ‘stats’ and ‘mixOmics’
  packages. N =3 controls and 3 PwMS. H. UMAP plots of astrocyte clusters. I. UMAP
  plots of astrocytes subdivided by lesion types. Ctrl: control without neurological
  disease; NAWM: normal‐appearing white matter; CI: chronic inactive; A: active; CA:
  chronic active. J. Dotplot of the top 10 differentially expressed genes obtained
  when comparing chronic active and active lesions against control astrocytes. K.
  Pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes obtained when
  comparing chronic active and active lesions against control astrocytes. Red bars
  and blue bars represent enriched and repressed pathways, respectively. Single‐nucleus
  RNA sequencing data in panels H–K were reanalyzed from Jäkel et al 2019 (GSE118257).'
