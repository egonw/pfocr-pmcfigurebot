caption: ECM1 enhances CRC cell resistance to 5-FU via the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway.
  (A,B) The indicated PI3K/AKT pathway proteins and phosphoproteins were detected
  in HCT15/FU or HCT15 cells in which ECM1 was silenced or overexpressed. (C) PI3K/AKT-related
  protein expression was detected following 740 Y-P treatment for 24 h to confirm
  treatment efficacy. (D–G) After treatment with 740 Y-P for 24 h, the invasive and
  migratory activities of HCT15/FU-shECM1 cells were examined via Transwell and wound
  healing analyses (D,E). In contrast, their apoptotic death was detected via TUNEL
  staining and flow cytometric analyses (F,G). (H,I) Western immunoblotting was used
  to identify proteins involved in apoptosis and EMT. The data are shown as means
  ± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
