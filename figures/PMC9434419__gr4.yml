caption: Role of Iron Metabolism, Ferroptosis and Metal Ion Oxidants in Atheroma Development.
  Routine recycling of erythrocytes and hemolytic stress induced by ROS and extracellular
  signaling leads to release of free iron ions into circulation, which are either
  taken up by PMBCs, or act as non-enzymatic oxidants of LDL-C/PUFAs. Macrophagic
  iron is also essential in catalytic activation of the iron-dependent peroxidation
  enzymes, LOXs, PTGSs, and thromboxane A synthase (TXAS), and subsequent downstream
  enzymes including platelet activation by protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1),
  resulting in pro-atherogenic pathway activation and atheroma progression. Figure
