caption: 'ICS II reduced OGD-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis: (a) cardiomyocyte apoptosis
  was performed via flow cytometry; (b) quantitation of apoptotic percentage (%) (n
  = 4); (c) representative Western blots of Bax and Bcl-2 expressions and representative
  Western blots of caspase3 and cleaved-caspase3 levels; (d) quantitation of Bax/Bcl-2
  ratio (n = 5); (e) quantitation of cleaved-caspase3/caspase3 ratio (n = 5). The
  data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ##p < 0.01 vs. control; * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 vs. OGD.'
