caption: Effect of magnoflorine on autophagy/Sirt1/AMPK pathway following cerebral
  ischemia in rats. Brain sections were stained with LC3 (green) and DAPI (blue) to
  reveal the expression of LC3 in the cortex. Representative images of the LC3 staining
  (a) and quantification the fluorescence intensity of LC3 (b) were shown. White arrows
  indicate LC3-positive cells. (c) Protein levels of LC3 II to LC3 I and p62 were
  analyzed using a western blot. (d–e) The bar graphs. (f–g) Sirt-1 and p-AMPK expressions
  in brain tissues, and the statistical data. Scale bar, 100 µm. Values are mean ± SEM,
  n = 3 per group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. MNF, magnoflorine; MCAO, middle
  cerebral artery occlusion.
