caption: 'A schematic overview of the main mechanisms of LJP against atherosclerosis,
  obesity, and diabetes. LJP inhibits atherothrombosis by interrupting oxidative stress-related
  lipid peroxidation, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inflammatory and macrophage-related
  cytokines, and the proliferation and migration of VSMC. LPJ exhibits the anti-obesity
  effect through the upregulation of P-AMPK. Subsequently, it inhibits ACC, SREBP-1c,
  and TNF-α, which results in decreased FA synthesis. LJP has the potential to play
  a role as the antidiabetic agent through the inhibition of the mobilization of FFA,
  PKC, oxidative stress, and α-glucosidases. LJP may increase glucose uptake and responsiveness
  to insulin in the muscle and recover the pancreatic islet cell secreting function,
  resulting in the regulation of blood sugar level and insulin resistance. ACC1: acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; CAT: catalase; FFA: free fatty acids; IL: interleukin; LCAT: lecithin
  cholesterol acyltransferase; LJP: Laminaria japonica; LOX-1: lectin-like oxidized
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-1; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; PI3K/Akt: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/protein kinase B; PKC: protein kinase C; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  SOD: superoxide dismutase; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.'
