caption: 'mtDNA damage repair in humans. Different stressors can cause mtDNA damage.
  If it is unrepairable, the mtDNA is degraded and newly synthetized. Proteins engaged
  in mtDNA repair are nuclear-encoded and transported to mitochondria. Base excision
  repair is the main mtDNA repair pathway. Other pathways show minor representation,
  lack full functional validation in humans or are only partially described. UV: ultraviolet
  light; IR: ionizing radiation; NHEJ: non-homologous end joining; MMEJ: microhomology-mediated
  end joining.'
