caption: 'FAM201A overexpression promoted CC cell invasion and CC tumorigenesis in
  vivo by downregulating miR-1271-5p expression. (a-c) The invasion of CC (SiHa and
  ME180) cells transfected with FAM201A overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p mimic
  alone or in combination was evaluated by the Transwell assay (magnification: ×250;
  scale: 50 μm). (d) Pictures of subcutaneous xenografts formed by SiHa cells with
  stable overexpressed FAM201A, miR-1271-5p or both (e, f). The volume (e) and weight
  (f) of subcutaneous xenografts formed by SiHa cells with stable overexpressed FAM201A,
  miR-1271-5p or both were measured weekly (e) or at the fifth week after resection
  (f). +P or #P < 0.05; ++P or ^^P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P or ###P;+ vs. NC+MC; ^ vs.
  FAM201A+MC; # vs. NC+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical cancer; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction; NC: negative control; FAM201A: the family
  with sequence similarity 201-member A; M: miR-1271-5p mimic; MC: mimic control.'
