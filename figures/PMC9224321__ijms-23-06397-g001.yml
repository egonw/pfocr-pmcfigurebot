caption: Allethrin exposure exerted toxic effects on ovarian function. Photomicrographs
  of ovarian sections from the control group (A) showed normal ovarian structures
  containing normal growing follicles (large arrows), whereas photomicrographs of
  allethrin-treated ovaries (B) showed altered structures in most of the growing follicles
  (arrows), as revealed by oocyte vacuolization and degradation, and this finding
  was obtained with both doses. Although few normal follicles were observed (large
  arrows), cystic dilation of follicles with decreased numbers of sparse granulosa
  cells was also observed with both exposure doses (B,C). Some of the ovaries from
  the higher dosage treated groups were reduced in size and contained cysts and degenerating
  follicles (C).
