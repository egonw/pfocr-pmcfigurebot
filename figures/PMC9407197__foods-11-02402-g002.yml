caption: Tomato as a model experimental system for investigating hostâ€“pathogen interaction.
  Upon insect attack or wounding, systemin is processed from prosystemin following
  proteolytic cleavages and further binds to its putative receptor STR1/2, thus triggering
  the octadecanoid pathway for JA synthesis. SCFCOI1 receptor perceives JA, further
  triggers JAZ repressor degradation and thus relieve the transcription factors to
  induce the expression of JA-responsive genes for defense.
