figure_title: AD-relevant pathways and neuron circuit firing are differentially regulated
  in rs148726219-edited mature iNeurons
caption: 'A. IPA gene ontology comparison analysis showing top 20 dysregulated pathways
  between WT-2A1 and homozygous clones (left column) and WT-2A1 and heterozygous clones
  (right column) on day 23. Z-scores denote level of pathway upregulation (orange)
  or downregulation (navy) based on log2FC values of DEGs contained within them. B.
  Differentially expressed genes involved in synaptogenesis, calcium signaling, and
  glutamate signaling (left), and cell cycle and unfolded protein response (right)
  based on FDR <0.05, log2FC <-1.0 and >1.0. Color denotes log2FC values; orange =
  upregulated, navy = downregulated. C. Differentially expressed genes in day 23 iN
  cells identified by RNA-seq involved in synaptogenesis, calcium signaling, glutamate
  signaling, cell cycle, and unfolded protein response based on FDR <0.05 and log2FC
  between -1.0 and 1.0. Expression values are expressed as fragments per kilobase
  per million mapped reads (FPKM) for WT (green bars), HET (orange bars) and HOM lines
  (purple bars). Four technical replicates for each clone are shown with each represented
  by a black dot. D. Calcium imaging from 1 representative experiment shows rs148726219-edited
  heterozygous hiPSC lines to have significantly enhanced functional circuit maturation
  compared to wildtype and homozygous lines. Top: Level of functional circuit activity
  and cofiring ratio was calculated (number of neurons fired at a time point over
  total excitable neurons). Greater peak amplitude of cofiring ratio of HET-2D2 line
  implicates formation of bigger circuits. Bottom: Chart of mean peak amplitude in
  5 individual replicates (each represented by a dot) of the HET-2D2 line shows statistically
  significant increase of functional circuit size compared to WT-2A1 and HOM-2H6 lines.
  Also, significantly less frequent circuit firing was observed with larger circuit
  formation in HET-2D2 line. * p < 0.5, **** p < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with multiple
  comparisons.'
