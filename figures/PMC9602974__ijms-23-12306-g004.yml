caption: 'The OmpR-like transcription factor is also involved in other Psa biological
  pathways. (a) The lipopolysaccharide content in G1, Δ13375, and OE13375; (b) original
  sequence peaks show the OmpR-like-binding regions in the lpxC promoter; (c) the
  differentially expressed genes related to lipopolysaccharide formation in Δ13375
  and OE13375 were revealed by RNA-seq analysis; (d) the capacity of biofilm formation
  in G1, Δ13375, and OE13375; (e) the transcription of biofilm formation pathway genes
  in Δ13375 and OE13375; (f) swimming motility of G1, Δ13375, and OE13375 and diameter
  measurements of halos obtained when strains with the same OD600 nm values were titrated
  on KB plates containing 0.3% agar and incubated within 24 h at 25 °C; (g) standard
  curves of G1, Δ13375, and OE13375 in LB medium were drawn by measuring the optical
  density at 600 nm of the bacterial suspension every 3 h; (h) virulence quantification
  of G1, Δ13375, and OE13375, obtained by calculating the average disease severity
  (ratio of diseased area to the total area of the leaf disc); (i) pathogenicity of
  G1, Δ13375, and OE13375 on woody canes of different kiwifruit varieties (“Hongyang”
  and “Guichang”), determined by the wound-inoculation method. The lesion length was
  measured 20 days after inoculation. G1: wild-type strain; Δ13375: OmpR-like deletion
  mutant; OE13375: OmpR-like overexpression mutant. The difference among samples were
  determined by least significant difference (LSD) tests for multiple comparisons,
  and different lowercase letters in indicate significant differences at p < 0.05.'
