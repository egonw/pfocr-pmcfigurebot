caption: The effect of NaB treatment on the phenylpropanoid pathway. (A) NaB-induced
  DEGs involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. (B) qRT-PCR validation using
  selected genes. (C) The levels of dihydroquercetin, gallic acid, and 2, 4-dihydroxybenzoic
  acid were assessed using HPLC. Means (±SE, three independent experiments) with different
  letters (p < 0.05, Duncan’s multiple range test) are significantly different. 0_Et,
  EtOAc fractions of the extract obtained from non-treated samples; 100_Et, EtOAc
  fractions of the extract obtained from 100 µM NaB-treated samples.
