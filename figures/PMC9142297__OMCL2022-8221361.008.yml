caption: Model for [Ca2+]mt disorder and abnormal MAPK activity in MII oocytes and
  early blastocysts. Oocytes with damaged mitochondrial function show [Ca2+]mt disorder,
  followed by a decline in cytosolic ATP level. In consequence, MAPK signaling is
  upregulated by [Ca2+]mt overload or downregulated by [Ca2+]mt defection. Overactivation
  and suppression of MAPK in GV oocytes both hinder the resumption of meiosis. In
  addition, epigenetic inheritance is damaged by ATP defection and abnormal MAPK activities,
  leading to an impaired early embryonic development. These observations implicate
  that [Ca2+]mt homeostasis is critical for early embryonic development in mice.
