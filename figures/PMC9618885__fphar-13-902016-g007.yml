caption: The mechanism of SMS2 inhibitors in inhibiting PANC-CM-induced M2 polarization.
  (A). Gene expression of the cytokine that can induce M2 polarization in PANC-1 (a)
  was analyzed by CCLE database and was detected by Realtime PCR in PANC-02 (b). The
  expression of MRC1 is positively correlated with CSF1R (c). The expression of CSF1R
  is positively correlated with SMS2 in pancreatic cancer (d). Immunoblotting was
  used to detect the expression of CSF1R and downstream proteins in BMDM (B) and THP-1
  (C) after PDAC-CM stimulation for 48Â h with or without YE2. Immunoblotting was used
  to detect the expression of CD206 and p-Stat3 in BMDM (E) and THP-1 (D) after rescue
  of p-Stat3 with Colivelin. Immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of CSF1R
  and M2 marker (Arg-1 or CD206) after supplement of exogenous sphingomyelin (SM)
  in BMDM (G) and THP-1 (F). The densitometry analysis data of BMDM (B,E and G) and
  THP-1 (C,D and F) was showed. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
