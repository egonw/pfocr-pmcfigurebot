caption: 'CFHR3 downregulation promotes phosphorylation of STAT3 and (A, B) GSEA plots
  show the enrichment of genes in response to JAK/STAT3 signaling between the HCC
  tissues with CFHR3high and CFHR3low (A), or between the HCC tissues with miR-590-3phigh
  and miR-590-3plow (B). (C–G) MHCC-97L cells transfected with shCFHR3-RNAs or miR-590-3p
  precursor were treated with S3I-201 (50μM) or DMSO (control) for 8 hours, and the
  indicated protein levels (C), cell growth (D), migration and invasion (E–G) were
  investigated. (H, I) The indicated luciferase-labeled MHCC-97L cells (2 × 106 cells/mouse)
  were injected into NOD-SCID mice (H); the luciferase activity was visualized 6 weeks
  post-transplantation (I, n = 5) (J, K) The tumor size (J) and number (K) of metastatic
  tumor nodules in mouse lung were observed and shown in a bar chart, respectively.
  (L) Representative IHC images of mouse metastatic tumors formed by MHCC-97L cells.
