figure_title: Engineered fatostatin NPs enhance the antitumor effects of fatostatin
  through targeted delivery to GBM cells
caption: A The chemical formula of fatostatin, PLGA, and PLGA-PEG-MAL. B Schematic
  diagram of nanoparticle synthesis. C SEM showed the morphology of NPs-FAT (loaded
  with fatostatin) and p28-NPs-FAT. D The ζ-potential of NPs-FAT and p28-NPs-FAT.
  E The mean hydration diameter of NPs-FAT and p28-NPs-FAT. F Cellular uptake assay
  using free C6, NPs encapsulated C6, and p28-NPs encapsulated C6. G CCK-8 assays
  showed the cell viability (absorbance value at 450 nm) of U87 and U251 cells after
  treatment with PBS, fatostatin (FAT), NPs-FAT, or p28-NPs-FAT. H The invasion ability
  of U87 and U251 cells after treatment with PBS (I), FAT(II), NPs-FAT(III), or p28-NPs-FAT
  (IV). I The ROS levels of U87 and U251 cells after treatment with PBS, FAT, NPs-FAT,
  or p28-NPs-FAT.
