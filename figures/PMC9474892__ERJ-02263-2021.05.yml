caption: 'Tuberculosis (TB) endotypes display distinct immune and metabolic gene expression
  activity scores. a) Pseudotime TB trajectory score in discovery cohort. Pathway
  activity scores were evaluated between healthy controls (HC), endotype B and endotype
  A. b) Inflammation and immunity pathways; c) metabolic pathways; and d) proliferation
  pathways. Specific gene changes are presented in supplementary table S2. ANOVA was
  used. Data are presented as median (interquartile range), with dotted line at median
  of HC. IFN: interferon; JAK: Janus kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; TNF: tumour necrosis factor; TCA: tricarboxylic acid; ETC: electron
  transport chain; ns: nonsignificant. ****: p<0.0001, #: p<0.0002, Â¶: p<0.0021.'
