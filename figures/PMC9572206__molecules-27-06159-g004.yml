caption: Decrease in the proportion of MUFAs by p-AKK treatment. (A) Total fatty acid
  profiles of C. elegans treated with different bacteria analyzed using GC-MS (N =
  3). The contents of each fatty acid were calculated. (B) The contents of total fatty
  acids in each group of nematodes were calculated (N = 3). (C) SFA, MUFA and PUFA
  levels in worms fed different bacteria (N = 3). (D) The desaturation index of fatty
  acid in each group were calculated (N = 3). Error bars represent SD. Using an independent
  sample t-test, statistically significant differences and extremely significant differences
  were defined as (*) p < 0.05 and (**) p < 0.01 compared to the OP50 group, respectively.
  (##) p < 0.01 compared to the p-OP50 group.
