caption: 'Polydatin-targeted genes related to the top five shared KEGG pathways. (A)
  Polydatin-targeted genes related to the Chemokine signaling pathway: (1) MAPK signaling
  pathway and (2) NF-kB. (B) Polydatin-targeted genes related to Renal cell carcinoma:
  (1) HIF-1 signaling pathway, and (2) MAPK signaling pathway. (C) Polydatin-targeted
  genes related to the MAPK signaling pathway:(1) Classical MAP kinase pathway, (2)
  JUK and p38 MAP kinase pathway, and (3) NFκB. (D) Polydatin-targeted genes related
  to the Neurotrophin signaling pathway: (1) MAPK signaling pathway, and (2) NFκB.
  (E) Polydatin-targeted genes related to Pathways in cancer: (1) HIF-1 signaling
  pathway, (2) MAKP signaling pathway, (3) NFκB, and (4) HSP.'
