caption: Summary of iodinated contrast media (ICM)-induced hypersensitivity. ICM or
  excipients may activate the basophil or mast cell to release histamine and other
  mediators, and then induce immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHR) via IgE-mediated
  or non-IgE pathways, such as the complement system pathway. Non-immediate hypersensitivity
  reaction (NIHR) induced by ICM can be evoked by a T-cell mediated pathway. Skin
  test, basophil activation test (BAT), drug provocation test (DPT), and lymphocyte
  transformation test (LTT) can achieve the diagnosis of ICM hypersensitivity. In
  patients with anaphylaxis or severe, prolonged symptoms of NIHR, prompt and appropriate
  intervention is needed.
