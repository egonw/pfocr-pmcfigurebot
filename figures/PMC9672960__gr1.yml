caption: Identification of Alox5 as the crucial driving force in patients with HF,
  stress-induced isolated cardiomyocytes and cardiac remodeling mice. a. Immunoblotting
  and quantitation of Alox5, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and MYH7/β-MHC
  (β-myosin heavy chain) protein levels in human heart tissue samples from normal
  donors (n = 4) and HF patients (n = 8). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test.
  b. Representative images of immunohistochemistry staining of Alox5 and brain natriuretic
  peptide (BNP) in human heart tissue samples from normal donors (n = 4) and HF patients
  (n = 4). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. c. Immunoblot analysis of Alxo5,
  FLAP and Myh7 protein expression (upper) and quantification of the protein level
  normalized to β-Tubulin protein (lower) in C57BL/6J mice following sham or TAC for
  2 and 4 weeks (n = 4). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. d. Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining of Alox5 (green) and cTnT (red) in C57BL/6J
  mice following sham or TAC for 4 weeks (n = 6). e. Representative images of immunofluorescence
  staining of Alox5 (Green) along with α-Actinin (Red) in NRVMs treated with vehicle
  or Ang II for 24h. f. Immunoblot analysis of Alxo5 protein expression (left) and
  quantification of the Alox5 protein level in nucleus normalized to Lamin B1 protein
  (right) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) treated with vehicle or angiotensin
  II (Ang II, 100 nM) for 24h (n = 4). Unpaired Student t-test. g. Heatmap generated
  by the one-to-one fold changes of identified metabolites in the arachidonic acid
  metabolism pathway in untargeted metabolomics dataset of human plasma samples. n = 4
  for normal donors and n = 7 for HF patients with LV hypertrophy. h. Left ventricular
  contents of arachidonic acid pathway metabolites of mice at indicated time points
  during TAC surgery based on untargeted metabolomics (n = 6 mice for each group).
  All data are mean ± SEM. P values are indicated.
