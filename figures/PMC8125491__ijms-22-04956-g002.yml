caption: An overview of synergic epigenetic interactions with neuroinflammatory pathways
  in PD development. Various epigenetic mechanisms synergistically interact with each
  other and with inflammatory pathways (MAPK signaling pathway, P13K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway, JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway) to feedforward
  neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease. These neuroinflammatory pathways activate
  microglia and astrocytes and release inflammatory cytokines. Overactivation of microglia
  and astrocytes triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which further
  damages normal dopamine neurons, leading to neuronal apoptosis and α-synuclein aggregation.
  Altogether, these synergic interactions form a vicious cycle that further exaggerates
  neuroinflammation to hallmark parkinsonism.
