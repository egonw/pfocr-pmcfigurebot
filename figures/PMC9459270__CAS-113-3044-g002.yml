caption: PD‐L1 bound to PD‐1. (A) Prediction of 10 PD‐L1 interacting genes based on
  the STRING database (the darker red lines between two genes indicate a higher score
  of interaction and PD‐1 is the highest score). (B) An obvious co‐expression between
  PD‐L1 and PD‐1, predicted by the MEM tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/mem/index.cgi).
  (C) The GO (left) and KEGG (right) pathway enrichment analyses of PD‐L1 and its
  interacting genes, with the vertical axis representing the enriched items (the top
  10) and the horizontal axis representing the number of genes enriched in the item.
  The color of the bubble, as shown by the color scale on the right, indicates the
  ‐logP value regarding the item. (D) PD‐L1 expression in exosomes derived from IFN‐γ‐treated
  C666‐1 cells measured by ELISA. (E) Western blot assay of PD‐L1 expression in exosomes
  derived from IFN‐γ‐treated C666‐1 cells. (F) The binding between PD‐L1 and PD‐1
  in exosomes derived from C666‐1 cells treated with IFN‐γ or anti‐PD‐L1 antibody
  (the OD450 value indicates the binding affinity between the two) measured by ELISA.
  *P < 0.05. Each cellular experiment was repeated three times
