caption: 'Effects of KC-A on AR expression in C4-2, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. (A–C) mRNA
  expression. The cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of
  KC-A. The expression levels of the mRNAs for AR and AR V7 were analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  (D–F) AR protein expression. After 24 h-treatment of KC-A, the levels of AR, AR
  Vs and AR V7 in C4-2 (D), LNCaP (E) and 22Rv1 (F) cells were analyzed by immunoblotting
  ** p < 0.01 denotes significantly different from the cells treated with DMSO alone.
  (G–L) Effects of KC-A on AR expression induced by androgens. The cells were pretreated
  for 2 h without or with 5 μM KC-A, and then cultured for 24 h in the absence or
  presence of 1 nM DHT, 10 nM Adione (G–I), 1 nM 11KDHT or 10 nM 11KAdione (J–L).
  The protein expression levels of AR and AR Vs were analyzed by immunoblotting **
  p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes significantly different from the cells
  treated with DMSO alone. ## p < 0.01, # p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes significantly
  different from the cells treated with DHT, Adione, 11KDHT or 11KAdione alone.'
