caption: 'CK attenuates DKD renal injury through inhibiting IMP-induced inflammation
  and fibrosis. (A) The levels of TLR4 pathway related proteins were detected by CK
  treatment under IMP pretreatment with or without LPS. (B) Data in (A) were expressed
  as means Â± SEM (n = 3). ###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05 compared to normal group.
  *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 compared to IMP group. $$$p < 0.001, $p <
  0.05 compared to IMP + LPS group.'
