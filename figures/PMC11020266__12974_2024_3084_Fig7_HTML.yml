caption: NSA or Mdivi-1 reversed the decrease in theta, beta, and gamma band power
  in the hippocampus of SAE mice. A Schematic timeline of the electrophysiological
  experiment. B Representative images of local field potential and filtered delta,
  theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band in the hippocampus. C Time frequency diagrams
  in the hippocampus. D Example power spectra of local field potential in the hippocampus.
  E–I Quantification of average delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band power in
  the hippocampus. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 4–5 mice/group). **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 versus the indicated groups
