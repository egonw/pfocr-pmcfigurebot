caption: LAMC2 was positively correlated with the expression of Lnc_AC006548.28 and
  negatively correlated with the expression of miR-223. (a) The suitable cell line
  and celecoxib concentration were selected by follow-up test. At last, MKN-45 cell
  and 40â€‰mg/L were used. (b) The cells were collected; the expression of LAMC2 protein
  and the expression of Lnc_AC006548.28 were detected by western blot. (c) RT-PCR
  detected the mRNA levels the expression of LAMC2, Lnc_AC006548.28, and miR-223.
