caption: 'IGFBP7-AS1 regulates the odontogenic differentiation of SHED via the p38
  MAPK pathway. (a) Western blot detected the expression of p-p38 and p38 in the si-NC
  and si-IGFBP7-AS1 groups. The ratio of p-p38 and p38 was calculated. (b) Western
  blot detected the expression of p-p38 and p38 in the NC and IGFBP7-AS1 groups. (c)
  Western blot detected the expression of p-p38 and p38 in the NC and IGFBP7-AS1 groups
  after adding the inhibitor of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The ratio of p-p38
  and p38 was calculated. (d) Images of ALP staining and ARS staining of IGFBP7-AS1
  overexpressed SHED odontogenic differentiation with or without SB203580. (e) qRT-PCR
  detected odontogenic differentiation-related markers: ALP, DSPP, and DMP1 of IGFBP7-AS1
  overexpressed SHED odontogenic differentiation with or without SB203580. Data were
  expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three experiments per group,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
