caption: 'Chemogenetic activation of a Gi-coupled pathway in neurons, but not astrocytes,
  resets SCN ensemble phase. A, Schematic showing cell type-specific targeting of
  Gi-coupled DREADDs to neurons (Syn-hM4Di::mCherry), but not astrocytes in the intact
  SCN network (left) alongside representative PMT traces showing acute vehicle (middle)
  and 100 nM CNO (right) treatment during the CT0 to CT6 time window. The treatment
  interval is shown as a vertical line and colored according to treatment: vehicle
  (gray) or CNO (blue). B, Summary peak amplitude data arranged by phase window of
  treatment showing paired recordings at that window for SCN with neuronally expressed
  Gi-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 6 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO
  (blue, N ≥ 6 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, **p
  = 0.0027. C, Summary cycle amplitude data arranged by phase window of treatment
  showing paired recordings at that window for SCN with neuronally expressed Gi-coupled
  DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 6 at each phase) or 100 nm CNO (blue, N
  ≥ 6 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, *p = 0.0421.
  D, Summary phase-shift data arranged by phase window of treatment showing paired
  recordings at that phase window for SCN with neuronally expressed Gi-coupled DREADDs
  treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 6 at each phase) or 100 nM CNO (blue, N ≥ 6 at each
  phase). Statistics: Sidak''s multiple-comparisons test, *p = 0.019. E, Schematic
  showing cell type-specific targeting of Gi-coupled DREADDs to astrocytes (GFAP-hM4Di::mCherry),
  but not neurons in the intact SCN network (left) alongside representative PMT traces
  showing acute vehicle (middle) and 100 nM CNO (right) treatment during the CT0 to
  CT6 time window. The treatment interval is shown as a vertical line and colored
  according to treatment: vehicle (gray) or CNO (pink). F, Summary peak amplitude
  data arranged by phase window of treatment showing paired recordings at that window
  for SCN with astrocytically expressed Gi-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray,
  N ≥ 4 at each phase) or 100 nm CNO (pink, N ≥ 4 at each phase). Statistics: Sidak''s
  multiple-comparisons test, *p = 0.0401. G, Summary cycle amplitude data arranged
  by phase window of treatment showing paired recordings at that window for SCN with
  astrocytically expressed Gi-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray, N ≥ 4 at
  each phase) or 100 nM CNO (pink, N ≥ 4 at each phase). H, Summary phase-shift data
  arranged by phase window of treatment showing paired recordings at that phase window
  for SCN with astrocytically expressed Gi-coupled DREADDs treated with vehicle (gray,
  N ≥ 4 at each phase) or 100 nm CNO (pink, N ≥ 4 at each phase). In all histogram
  plots, individual points joined by lines represent individual slices with paired
  treatment and histogram bars with error bars represent mean ± SEM.'
