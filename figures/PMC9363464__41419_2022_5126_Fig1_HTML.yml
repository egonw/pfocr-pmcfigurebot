figure_title: Keap1/NFE2L2 (Nrf2) mutations predict shorter overall survival in patients
  with HNSCC
caption: A Alterations of the Keap1 gene in major cancer types from TCGA database.
  B Venn diagram indicates the number of patients with head and neck cancer in the
  MISK-IMPACT database that is wild-type for the mutation (green), mutant for TERT
  (yellow), mutant for Keap1(light blue), and mutant for Nrf2 (purple) (n = 186).
  C Multivariate Cox regression analysis for each indicated variable was performed.
  D The risk ratio of overall survival corresponds to each indicated variable. Nrf2
  (P < 0.01), Keap1/Nrf2 (p < 0.001) and Keap1 (p < 0.001) mutations are independently
  identified as significant covariate for overall survival. The table indicates the
  overall survival across each group with a 95% confidence interval. E Electropherogram
  depicting Keap1 mutation sequence analysis for HNSCC. The top part shows the detection
  of the Keap1 mutations identified in HNSCC patients’ tumors and the bottom part
  shows the non-cancerous normal individuals’ Keap1 sequence. The table below shows
  the details of each patient and amino acid changes and corresponding Nrf2 positivity.
  F Schematic diagram of conserved domain showing the structure of Keap1 protein and
  the location of each mutation within Keap1 protein. NTD N-terminal domain (amino
  acids), BTB broad complex-Tramtrack-Bric-a-brack, IVR intervening regions, KR Kelch
  repeat. G Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival analysis curve of Keap1 wild-type and
  Keap1 mutant HNSCC patients (n = 24; 4-Keap1 mutant and 20- Keap1 wild-type patient)
  (Log-rank p < 0.0001).
