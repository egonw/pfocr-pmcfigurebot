caption: TCA cycle intermediates. The levels of (A) citrate, (B) aconitate, (C) α-KG,
  (D) succinate, and (E) malate in PWH before and after ART compared with HIVSN. Scatter
  plots show mean and significance notations of adjusted p-values (95% CI) at ** =
  p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, and **** = p < 0.0001. For multiple group comparisons,
  Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were performed in combination with Games-Howell
  multiple comparisons correction for sample sizes >50 with a 95% confidence interval.
  (F) Diagrammatic representation of metabolic pathways modified by HIV and ART. In
  pre-ART HIV blue text indicates pathway name, black text indicates no change, red
  text indicates significantly increased levels, and aqua text indicates significantly
  decreased levels compared with HIVSN. Solid line up-arrows (↑) indicate significantly
  increased and solid line down-arrows (↓) indicate significantly decreased levels
  following ART compared with pre-ART HIV.
