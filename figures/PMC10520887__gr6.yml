caption: The leucine 373 of pSTING is critical for its interaction with pIKKε and
  pTBK1.A and B, GFP-pSTING or pSTING L373A was cotransfected with mCherry-pIKKε into
  HEK293T for 48 h, followed by co-IP and subsequent Western blot analysis. C and
  D, GFP-pSTING or pSTING L373A was cotransfected with mCherry-pTBK1 into HEK293T
  for 48 h, followed by co-IP and subsequent Western blot analysis. E, 3D4/21 cells
  in 24-well plates were cotransfected with GFP-pSTING L373A and mCherry-pIKKε/pTBK1-mCherry
  for 24 h. Cells were fixed, stained, and examined for cellular colocalization by
  confocal microscopy. co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney
  293T cell line; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; pTBK1, phosphorylated TANK-binding kinase 1;
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes.
article_title: Porcine IKKε is involved in the STING-induced type I IFN antiviral
  response of the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway.
