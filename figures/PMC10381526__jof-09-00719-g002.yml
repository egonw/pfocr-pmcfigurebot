caption: CRISPR-mediated double-gene-editing system in A. nidulans. (A) Schematic
  illustration of the CRISPR-mediated double gene editing system. Pgpd/Ptef indicates
  the promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene/translation elongation
  factor EF-1 gene of A. nidulans. Primer F and R indicates the diagnostic primer
  pair. (B) Biosynthetic pathway/rTCA pathway of L-malic acid in A. nidulans. The
  red fonts and green fonts represent genes that needed to be overexpressed and deleted,
  respectively. Pyc, pyruvate carboxylase; OahA, oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase; MdhC,
  malate dehydrogenase; DctA, C4-dicarboxylic acid transporter; CexA, citric acid
  transporter. (C) Transformation plates generated by introducing repair templates
  amplified from plasmid pCZ05 and pCZ03 into ZQ01. (D) Diagnostic PCR to verify the
  integration of the corresponding repair template into the oahA locus. Three random
  transformants (ZQ02/ZQ03-1/2/3) were selected. (E) The relative transcript levels
  of pyc in related strains growing at 37 °C for 24 h. Values represent the mean ±
  SD of three replicates. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s
  t test. **, p < 0.01.
