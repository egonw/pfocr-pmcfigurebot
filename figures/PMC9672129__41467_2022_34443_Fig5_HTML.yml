figure_title: CNTF-dependent enhancement of aerobic glycolysis and anabolism
caption: Metabolomics analysis of WT, rds, and rds mutant retinas treated with LV-IG
  or LV-CNTF from P25-P36 using glucose as a nutrient. a Energy metabolites ATP, phosphocreatine
  (p-creatine), and ADP/ATP ratios. b Nucleotide derivatives. c Glycolytic pathway
  intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and 2-phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). d TCA cycle
  metabolites citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and malate. e Redox-related metabolites
  glutathione (GSH) and glutathione bisulfide (GSSG). f Heatmap shows retinal amino
  acid contents. g Heatmap shows fatty acid metabolic intermediates. For a–e, data
  were presented as mean ± SEM. Independent retinal sample numbers (N) and adjusted
  P values based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey all-pairs test are shown with P < 0.0001
  indicated as ****.
