caption: Activation of the JNK pathway in murine intestinal tumors and human colorectal
  cancer (hCRC) was stimulated by BRG1 suppression. (A) Immunostaining for BRG1 in
  human colon epithelium and CRC. Scale bars = 50 μm and 20 μm. (B) Quantitative real‐time
  (qRT)‐PCR analysis of BRG1 in hCRC and surrounding normal epithelium (p = 0.0255,
  n = 8). Means ± SEM are shown. (C) Heatmap of microarray analysis of JNK signaling
  pathway in DLD‐1 (left) and HCT 116 (right) cells silenced with si nontargeting
  RNA or siBRG1 through Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus) (n = 3
  independent experiments). (D) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of JNK pathway in hCRC
  cells silenced with control and siBRG1. FDR, false discovery rate; NES, normalized
  enrichment score. (E) qRT‐PCR analysis of c‐JUN expression in DLD‐1 and HCT 116
  cells silenced with control or siBRG1 (DLD‐1, p = 0.0045; HCT 116, p = 0.0041; n = 3–4).
  (F) Western blot analysis for p‐c‐JUN and c‐JUN expression in DLD‐1 and HCT 116
  cells silenced with control or siBRG1. Analyzed by Student' s t‐test. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

  cancer in the context of BRG1 suppression.
