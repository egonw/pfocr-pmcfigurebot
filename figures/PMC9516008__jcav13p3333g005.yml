caption: Inhibition of JNK activity reduced snake venom-induced cell death. (A and
  B) SW480 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in the absence or
  presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μM) pretreated for 2 h. The cell viability
  of snake venom treated cells was measured by MTT assay (A) or LDH release assay
  (B). The data are presented as mean ± SD in three independent experiments. *** P
  < 0.05. (C) Representative fluorescence microscopy images showing nuclear staining
  for DAPI (blue) and TUNEL positive (Green) in cells treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom
  for 24 in the absence or presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μM) pretreated for
  2 h. The number of stained positive cells were counted in three different fields
  and averaged. The data are presented as mean ± SD in three independent experiments.
  *** P < 0.05. (D) SW480 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in
  the absence or presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μM) pretreated for 2 h. The
  indicated protein levels were evaluated by immunoblotting.
