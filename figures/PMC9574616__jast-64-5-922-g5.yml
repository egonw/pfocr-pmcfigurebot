figure_title: Effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the antagonists of 5-HT receptor
  1B (SB224289) and 4 (SB204070) on the protein expression in mTOR and JAK2-STAT5
  signaling pathway (n=3)
caption: The control group is DMEM basics culture medium with 10% FBS. The concentration
  of 5-HT added was 20 µM in each treatment group except for control group. All cells
  were cultured in medium for 24 hours. Values represent means ± SD. β-Actin was used
  to normalize the expression of target proteins. Different letters above the bar
  indicate differences among different groups (p < 0.05). mTOR, mechanistic target
  of rapamycin; eEF2, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2; 4EBP, 4E-binding
  proteins; S6K, S6 kinase; JAK2, janus kinase 2; STAT5, signal transducers and activators
  of transcription 5; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum.
