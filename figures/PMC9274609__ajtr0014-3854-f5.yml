caption: 'NBDP inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB signal pathway. A: Western
  blotting results of p-IKKα/β; B: Western blotting results of IκBα; C: Western blotting
  results of p-IκBα; D: Western blotting results of p-P65. The quantitative data were
  presented as mean ± SD of 6 mice. *P<0.05 compared with Control. #P<0.05 compared
  with Model. &P<0.05 compared with N-NBD. %P<0.05 compared with L-NBD.'
