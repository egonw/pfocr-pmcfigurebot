caption: Model for the role of VTE7 in connecting chlorophyll biosynthesis with tocopherol
  synthesis. Proteins are indicated by lettered boxes with black highlight indicating
  associations with genome-wide significance, gray highlight pathway level associations
  and white highlight no association in this study. VTE7 is highlighted in red and
  had the highest genome-wide significance in this study and the third largest kernel
  totalT QTL effect in the maize NAM panel (). POR is stippled black as though not
  associated with natural variation in this study, two maize POR paralogs had the
  largest kernel totalT QTL effects in the maize NAM panel (). The large white box
  indicates, LIL3, which physically interacts with POR and GGR associating them with
  the membrane. Black lines are supported directly by evidence while dashed lines
  are postulated. VTE5, phytol kinase; VTE6, phytylphosphate kinase; VTE2, homogentisate
  phytyl transferase.
