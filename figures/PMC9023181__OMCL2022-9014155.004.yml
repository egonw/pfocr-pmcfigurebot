caption: (a) Analysis of hub genes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
  for the candidate pathways. Nodes encircled in pink, red, blue, yellow, green, and
  brown indicate significant genes in pathways involved oxidative phosphorylation,
  cardiac muscle contraction, calcium signalling, fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance,
  apoptosis, and TNF pathway, respectively. (b) Validation of key genes in ventricular
  tissue of rats in control, low and high STZ treatment groups using RT-PCR. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. Compared with control. n = 6 − 7 per group.
