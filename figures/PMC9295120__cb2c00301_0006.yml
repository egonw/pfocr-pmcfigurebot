caption: Elesclomol-induced gene expression signature. (A) Differential expression
  analysis for elesclomol treatment (200 nM for 6 h) vs DSMO in the two most sensitive
  cell lines OAC-P4C and SK-GT-4. P-value cutoff equivalent to adjusted p-value 0.05.
  n = 3. (B) Average logâ€¯2 fold change for the most significant genes. (C) Top pathway
  Z-scores (by p-value) identified in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in the sensitive
  cell lines (OAC-P4C and SK-GT-4).
