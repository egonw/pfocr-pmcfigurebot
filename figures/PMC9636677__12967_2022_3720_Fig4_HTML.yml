caption: 'Exosomes regulated the apoptosis rate and cell cycle distribution of KYSE50
  and ECA109 ESCC cells. A, B The apoptosis rate in each group was detected by flow
  cytometry. C IR-shHMGB1-Exos induces G2/M phase arrest in KYSE150 and ECA109 ESCC
  cells after IR. D The histogram of cell cycle distribution was expressed as mean ± standard
  error for each group. E After IR, the proteins Bax/Bcl2 were regulated by both exosomes
  in KYSE150 and ECA109 cells. F IR-shHMGB1-Exos regulated CDK1/Cyclin B1 to induce
  G2/M phase arrest after IR. A comparison with the IR-NC-Exos group is indicated
  by asterisks *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01; A comparison with the corresponding non-irradiated
  group is indicated by triangles ▲P < 0.05, ▲▲▲P < 0.001 and ▲▲▲▲P < 0.0001. HMGB1:
  high mobility group box 1; IR: irradiation; NC: negative control; Exos: exosomes'
