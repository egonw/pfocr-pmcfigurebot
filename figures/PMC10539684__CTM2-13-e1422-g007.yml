caption: Ying Yang 1 (YY1) had high neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) expression.
  (A) Violin plots showing the expression of YY1 in prostate cancer and different
  clinical variables (T stage, N stage, M stage, and Gleason scores) from the Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA). (B) Violin plot (left) and heatmap (right) showed the aberrant
  expression of YY1 in enzalutamide‐resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells compared
  to negative control cells from GSE78201. (C) Violin plot (left) and heatmap (right)
  showed the aberrant expression of YY1 in NEPC compared to castration‐resistant prostate
  cancer (CRPC) from the SU2C 2015 program. (D) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
  of YY1 in normal prostate tissue, primary prostate cancer tissue (ADPC), CRPC tissue,
  NEPC tissue, lymph node (LN) and seminiferous duct (SV) metastasis from NEPC. (E)
  IHC scores of YY1 in different tissues (normal, ADPC, CRPC, and NEPC). (F) IHC scores
  of YY1 in different staged prostate cancer tissues. (G) The YY1 mRNA levels in 16
  pairs of prostate cancer and matched adjacent normal tissues. Red, log2 (tumour:normal
  expression) value >  1; blue, 1 ≥ log2 (tumour:normal expression) value ≥ − 1. (H,
  I) YY1 expression was examined in RWPE‐1 and PCa cells lines via quantitative reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) (H) and western blotting (I).
  n.s, not significant, *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.
