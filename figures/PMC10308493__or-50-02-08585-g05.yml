caption: Activation of NF-κB or overexpression of AKT1 antagonizes the inhibitory
  effects of ST2825 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells in vivo. (A) Image of
  each nude mouse and its hypodermic tumor in four groups (the mice treated with negative
  control, ST2825, ST after IL-1α and ST + AKT1). (B and C) Body weight and tumor
  weight changes of the groups in panel A. (D and E) IHC analysis of MyD88 expression
  in the tumors of the groups in panel A. (F and G) IHC analysis of phosphorylated-p65
  expression in the tumors of the groups in panel A. (H and I) IHC analysis of phosphorylated-AKT1
  expression in the tumors of the groups in panel A. (J and K) IHC analysis of p21
  expression in the tumors of the groups in panel A. The data are presented as the
  mean ± SD. The t-test and Bonferroni test were used for statistical analysis, *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001; N.S., not significant. IHC, immunohistochemical; NC, negative
  control; ST, ST2825.

  by suppressing the activation of the NF‑κB/AKT1/p21 pathway in pancreatic cancer.
