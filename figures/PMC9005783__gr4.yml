caption: Matching predicted enzymes with metabolic pathway holes. A plot depicting
  all pathways in yeast that have an enzymatic step for which an enzyme has not yet
  been identified (hole). Plotted are the number of proteins with matching enzymatic-annotation
  (EC number) uncovered by SSSP. Green represents a full (4- positions) match. Blue
  represents a partial (3- positions) match. Highlighted in orange is the pathway
  on which we focus ().
