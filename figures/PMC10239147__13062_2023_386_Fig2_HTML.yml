caption: Effects of LINC01003 on the proliferation and cell cycle of glioma cells.
  A–B EdU (5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) staining assay was performed to determine the
  proliferation of U87MG and U251 cells with LINC01003 knockdown. The percentage of
  EdU-positive cells were counted; scale bar, 200 μm. C–D Flow cytometry with propidium
  iodide (PI) staining was used to detect the cell cycle. A histogram showing the
  proportion of glioma cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase. Data represent the mean ± SD
  from three independent experiments; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01
article_title: m6A-mediated upregulation of LINC01003 regulates cell migration by
  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
