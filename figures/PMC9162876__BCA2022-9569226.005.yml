caption: OENE inhibited fatty acid biosynthesis of PC3. (a) Oil Red O staining was
  used to identify the lipid droplets in PC3. (b) The mRNA expression analysis of
  HMGCR, FASN, and SREPB1 transcripts involved in the lipogenesis pathway was quantified.
  The β-actin was used as an internal control. Each bar represents the mean ± standard
  error of triplicate samples from three independent experiments (p=0.05, using Student's
  t-test).
