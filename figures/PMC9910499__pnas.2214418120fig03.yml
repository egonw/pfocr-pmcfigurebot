caption: Prostaglandin signaling is necessary for production of attractive fertile
  female cue. (A) IM inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis pathway by antagonizing
  cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2), thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonic
  acid to prostaglandin H2, precursor for PGF2α, PGD2, and PGE2. (B) An experimental
  flowchart for testing the necessity of prostaglandins in mediating female reproductive
  pheromone signaling. (C) In fertile females, IM treatment significantly reduced
  waterborne PGF2α to a level similar to that of nonfertile females 4 h after injection.
  Mean ± SEM; the ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test for post hoc analysis. (D) Before
  IM injection, male cichlids show strong preference to fertile female odors; after
  IM injection, this preference is significantly reduced. Gray squares and lines represent
  individual behavior performance, while black squares and lines represent mean ±
  SD. Mann–Whitney U test, n = 10 fish per experiment. n.s., nonsignificant in statistical
  analysis.
