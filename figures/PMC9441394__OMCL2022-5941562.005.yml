caption: Knockdown of EID3 regulated spheroid forming, invasion, and chemoresistance
  of osteosarcoma cells. (a) Western blot analysis of EID3 in MG-63 cells transfected
  with EID3 shRNA or control shRNA for 48 h. (b) The spheroid-forming abilities of
  MG-63-shRNA and MG-63-shEID3 cells in tumorsphere culture. (c) Transwell assay of
  the invasion of MG-63-shRNA and MG-63-shEID3 cells. (d) Cells were treated with
  EID3 shRNA or control shRNA and DOX for 48 h. Cell proliferation was measured by
  CCK-8 assay. All data are presented as mean ± SE (n = 3). ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗, p < 0.001.
