caption: The antigen presentation by MHC class I pathway is upregulated inNAT1KO cells.
  A, proteomics analysis showed the levels of the indicated accessory proteins in
  the pathway (i.e., tapasin/TAPBP, TAP1, TAP2, and CALR) were significantly elevated
  in both KO cell lines (i.e., KO2 and KO5), compared to parental (P) MDA-MB-231 cells.
  The y-axis shows the relative fold change in log base 2 (Log2). One-way ANOVA and
  a Bonferroni multiple comparison post-test were performed to calculate statistical
  significance of the difference in the indicated proteins between parental (P) vs.
  KO2 or KO5 cell line. ***, p < 0.001. B, representative Western blots for tapasin
  and TAP1 in the indicated cell lines. GAPDH is shown as an internal control.
