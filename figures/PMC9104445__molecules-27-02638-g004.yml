caption: 'Effect of piperine pretreatment on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of
  KA-treated rats. (A) CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus are observed with NeuN,
  FJB, and DAPI immunofluorescent staining. Scar bar for hippocampus = 200 µm; scar
  bar for CA1 and CA3 regions = 100 µm. (B,C) Quantitative analysis of NeuN-positive
  and FJB-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Data are presented
  as the means ± S.E.M. (n = 4). # p < 0.001 versus the KA group; ** p < 0.01 versus
  the control group; *** p < 0.001 versus the control group; $ p < 0.01 versus the
  KA + piperine 10 mg/kg group (ANOVA/Scheffé).'
