caption: Proposed mechanism of p38 activation by Hg2+ and selenite and NAC protection.
  Exposure to Hg2+ reduces GSH levels and TrxR activity leading to the production
  of ROS and oxidation of Trx which activates the MAP3K ASK-1 and downstream p38.
  This is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes inflammatory
  gene transcription. If cells are pre-exposed to NAC or sodium selenite, GSH or TrxR
  levels are maintained, the inhibitory effect of Hg2+ mitigated (dotted lines) and
  no p38 activation is observed. Molecular pathways and signaling cascades are simplified
  for clarity. Green arrows indicate activation of a pathway and red lines inhibition.
  Blue arrows indicate links between TrxR inhibition and Trx oxidation, selenite supplementation
  and Se2âˆ’ availability and NAC supplementation and Cys availability.
