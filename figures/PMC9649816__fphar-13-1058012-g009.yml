caption: 'In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of ICE on HCL/EtOH induced gastritis model.
  Mice orally administered 6 times with ICE (35 mg/kg), ICE (100 mg/kg), or ranitidine
  (35 mg/kg) for 3 days were orally treated with HCL/EtOH for 1 h. Gstric lesions
  were photographed (A) and inflammatory lesion was quantitatively estimated by ImageJ
  (B). mRNA expression levels of iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in the gastric tissue
  (C–F). *p < 0.05 versus the LPS treated cells (LPS); #p < 0.05 versus the normal
  cells (Control).'
