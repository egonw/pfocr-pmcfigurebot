caption: 5-HTP-induced head twitch response in PRDX6-Tg mice. (A) The cumulative head
  twitch response for each group was measured after 5-HTP (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal
  [i.p.]) injection in mice. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error (SE) (non-Tg
  female n=5, male n=4, total n=9; PRDX6-Tg female n=3, male n=2, total n=5) and were
  analyzed using Student’s t-test (vs. non-Tg group). (B) The head twitch response
  of each time zone was scored for 2 min at 10 min after 5-HTP (150 mg/kg, i.p.) injection
  in mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SE (non-Tg female n=5, male n=4, total n=9;
  PRDX6-Tg female n=3, male n=2, total n=5) and were analyzed using two-way RM ANOVA
  followed by Bonferroni post-hoc t-test (*p<0.05 vs. non-Tg group in each time zone).
  5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; PRDX6, Peroxiredoxin 6; PRDX6-Tg, PRDX6-overexpressing
  transgenic.
