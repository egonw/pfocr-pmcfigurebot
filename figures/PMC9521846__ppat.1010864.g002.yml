figure_title: TgG6PDH1, TgG6PDH2, Tg6PGDH1, TgRuPE and TgTAL are dispensable for parasite
  growth and virulence, while TgG6PDHs are required for defending against oxidative
  stress
caption: (A), Plaque assay comparing the growth of Δg6pdh1, Δg6pdh2, Δ6pgdh1, Δrupe
  and Δtal tachyzoites in vitro to that of wild-type strain RHΔku80. (B), Relative
  sizes (pixel size calculated by photoshop) of plaques. Means ± SD of >60 plaques
  (n = 3). (C), Representative Plaques image showing the comparative growth of Δg6pdh1Δg6pdh2
  and RHΔku80 strains. (D), Graph presentation of plaque sizes of Δg6pdh1Δg6pdh2 and
  RHΔku80 strains. Means ± SD of >60 plaques (n = 3). (E), Virulence tests of indicated
  strains in ICR mice (100 parasites per mouse, 10 mice for each strain). (F), Intracellular
  replication assay comparing parasite proliferation under standard culture conditions.
  Freshly egressed tachyzoites of RHΔku80, Δg6pdh1, Δg6pdh2 and Δg6pdh1Δg6pdh2 parasites
  were allowed to infect HFF monolayers for 1 h, and invaded parasites were cultured
  at 37°C with 5% CO2 for another 24 h. Percentiles of the parasitophorous vacuole
  (PV) containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or more parasites were determined and plotted. Means
  ± SEM from three independent experiments (n = 3). (G), Freshly egressed tachyzoites
  of indicated strains were pre-treated with 500 μM H2O2 medium for 3 h, and then
  subjected to intracellular replication assay (without H2O2) for 24 h. Means ± SEM
  from three independent experiments was graphed. Two-way ANOVA, *, p <0 .05, ***,
  P < 0.001. (H), RHΔku80 tachyzoites were purified, total RNA was extracted and reversed
  into cDNA. Transcript levels for TgG6PDH1 and TgG6PDH2 in each sample were analyzed
  by quantitative real-time PCR, using β-tubulin as an internal reference. Means ±
  SEM of four independent experiments (n = 4). Student’s t-test, ***, P<0.001. (I),
  Parasites (approximately 3×107) were purified by 3 μm membrane filtration, washed
  with cold PBS and extracted with extraction buffer. Relative NADPH levels in RHΔku80
  (WT), Δg6pdh1 and Δg6pdh2 were determined by the NADPH Assay kit. Means ± SEM from
  three independent experiments (n = 3). **, P<0.01; one-way ANOVA.
