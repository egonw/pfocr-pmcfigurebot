figure_title: Deletion of REST in cochlear results in hearing impairment in mice
caption: 'A Schematic illustration of the Rest conditional knockout (Rest cKO) generation
  process. Two LoxP sites are inserted on either side of the coding sequence of exon
  2. Expression of Cre recombinase is activated by a specific Atoh1 promoter in the
  cochlea, resulting in loss of REST function in the cochlea. B Modified Rest flox
  allele exon 2 and Atoh1-Cre insertion was confirmed by PCR genotyping of DNA extracted
  from cochlea of vehicle (WT), or Rest cKO mice. C Representative ABR waveforms of
  WT, Rest Het (Heterozygote mice), and Rest cKO (Homozygous mice). D ABR thresholds
  of WT, Rest Het, and Rest cKO mice in response to pure tone stimuli (8–32 kHz).
  E Morphological changes of SGNs from WT and Rest cKO mice. Scale bar: 20 µm. F The
  density of SGNs was quantified in WT and Rest cKO mice. G Morphological changes
  in HCs were observed from WT and Rest cKO mice. Scale bar: 10 µm. H, I Quantification
  of OHCs and IHCs in WT and Rest cKO mice. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.'
