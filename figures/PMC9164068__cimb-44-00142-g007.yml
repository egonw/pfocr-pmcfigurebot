caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in luteolin-treated
  cells. In the image, the top 20 KEGG pathways with −log10 (p value) and multiple
  enrichment are plotted. A higher fold enrichment value and −log10 (p value) indicate
  that the expression level of the pathway is higher and more reliable.
