caption: 'Dapagliflozin-mediated apoptosis is blocked by a caspase signaling pathway
  in Caki-1 cells. (A) Cells were treated with 100 µM dapagliflozin for 24 h in the
  presence or absence of z-VAD-fmk. Morphological changes were visualized by light
  microscopy at a magnification of ×200. (B) Caki-1 cells were pretreated with 50
  µM z-VAD-fmk or solvent for 30 min and cultivated with dapagliflozin for 24 h. The
  Sub-G1 fraction was analyzed by FACS. The FACS data are presented in the upper panel.
  The percentage of the sub-G1 population is shown in the lower panel. (C) Caki-1
  cells were pretreated with 50 µM z-VAD-fmk or solvent for 30 min and cultivated
  with 100 µM dapagliflozin for 24 h. Protein expression levels of PARP, cleaved caspase-3,
  cFLIPL, cFLIPS and β-actin were examined by western blotting. β-actin was used as
  a loading control. Cleaved caspase-3 is indicated by arrows. Data were acquired
  in three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05
  compared with untreated cells, #P<0.05 compared with dapagliflozin-treated cells.
  Con, dapagliflozin 0 µM; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl-ketone;
  PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; cFLIP, cellular Fas-associated death domain-like
  interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein.'
