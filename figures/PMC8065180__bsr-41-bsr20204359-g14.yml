caption: The GO terms (A) ‘Intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway’, (B) ‘Regulation
  of apoptotic signaling pathway’, (C) ‘Intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by P53
  class mediator’, (D) ‘G1 DNA damage checkpoint’, (E) ‘Glycolysis process’, (F) ‘Fatty
  acid metabolic process’, (G) ‘Regulation of mRNA catabolic process’, (H) ‘Signal
  transduction by P53 class mediator’ and (I) ‘Tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling
  pathways’ were enriched in the ADAMTS6 low-expression groups.
