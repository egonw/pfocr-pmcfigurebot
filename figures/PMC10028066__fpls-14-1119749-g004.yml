caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Gemstone
  seedless grape that was treated with hyperoside and control at the B2, B3, B4, and
  B5 stages. The number of genes enriched in the pathway is represented by the size
  of the circle, and the color corresponds to the size’s p-value. Red labels are enriched
  in the top 10 sites, P < 0.05, and are associated with anthocyanin synthesis.
article_title: Transcriptome analysis reveals the crucial function of hyperoside in
  inhibiting anthocyanin accumulation in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) fruits by inducing
  VvMYB62 .
