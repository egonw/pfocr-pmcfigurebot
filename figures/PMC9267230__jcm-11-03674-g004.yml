caption: 'Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Downregulated in Ccndbp1 KO/KO mice.
  Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of all the differentially expressed genes
  between DSS-treated wild-type mice or Ccndbp1-knockout mice on day 8 after DSS initiation.
  Vertical axis displays the number of significant genes corresponding to each functional
  type. All GO categories with an adjusted enrichment p value of less than 0.01 and
  more than 2-fold change are included. The categories of BP: biological process,
  MF: molecular function, and CC: cellular compartment are represented by blue, red,
  and green, respectively.'
