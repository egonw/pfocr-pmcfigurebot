caption: 'Effect of MLK3 on AP-1 activation. (a,g,h) The mRNA expression levels of
  MLK3 and HPK1, as well as inflammatory genes (COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were
  determined by real-time PCR from HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-MLK3 (a,g) or
  adapter molecules (MyD88 and TRIF) (h). (b–f) Luciferase activity mediated by AP-1,
  NF-κB, IRF3, and GATA/T-bet/NF-AT in HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-MLK3 and
  AP-1-Luc, NF-κB-Luc, STAT3-Luc, IRF-3-Luc, or IFN-γ-promoter-Luc was determined
  by luminometer. Results (a–f) are expressed as mean ± SD. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,
  and ### p < 0.001 compared to the normal group (no treatment). MYC: empty vector
  (PCMV) with MYC.'
