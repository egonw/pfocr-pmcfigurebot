caption: Tripartite motif‐containing 37 (TRIM37) activated the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB)
  signaling pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer. (A) Western blot analysis was used
  to assay the expression level of NF‐κB signaling pathway proteins after TRIM37 was
  overexpressed or depressed. (B) Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC; 50 μM), an inhibitor
  of the NF‐κB signaling pathway, reversed the upregulated N‐cadherin, MMP‐9, Bcl‐xl,
  and Bcl‐2 and downregulated cleaved poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) induced by
  TRIM37 overexpression. (C) LPS (100 ng/ml), an activator of the NF‐κB signaling
  pathway, reversed the downregulated N‐cadherin, MMP‐9, Bcl‐xl, and Bcl‐2 and upregulated
  cleaved PARP induced by TRIM37 underexpression

  cells by suppressing tripartite motif‐containing 37‐induced tumor necrosis factor
  receptor‐associated factor 2 ubiquitination.
