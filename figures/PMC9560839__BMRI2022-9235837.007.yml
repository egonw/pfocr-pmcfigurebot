caption: 'Knocking down SOX8 and/or treatment with RO04929097 suppress the growth
  and bone metastasis of Enza-R cells in vivo. Nude mice with subcutaneous or bone
  xenograft tumors were treated with 10 mg/kg enzalutamide and 50 mg/kg RO04929097.
  (a) Tumor growth curve. (b) Weight of tumors. (c) Images of the recovered tumors.
  (d) X-ray of bone metastasis (red arrow). (e) H&E staining of bone metastasis (upper
  ×100, lower ×200; black arrow). (f) The expression of SOX8 and Notch4 in xenograft
  and bone lesion was detected by IHC. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗∗P < 0.001; Enza-R: enzalutamide-resistant
  LNCaP cells.'
