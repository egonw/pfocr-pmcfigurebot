caption: 'Detection on the expressions of the EMT relevant molecules. (a) The western
  blot assay to reveal the expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin, TGF-β, and snail.
  (b) Semiquantitative analysis was performed based on the gray value. GAPDH was used
  for the endogenous protein. (c) The qPCR detection on the expressions of N-cadherin,
  vimentin, TGF-β, and snail. ##compared with UUO, P < 0.01.'
