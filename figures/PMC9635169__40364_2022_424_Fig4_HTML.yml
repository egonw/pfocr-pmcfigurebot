caption: Ectopic expression of miR-637 reduces the growth of ESCC xenografts in mice.
  A total of 3 × 106 KYSE450 cells stably transduced with lentivirus (LV) expressing
  miR-637 or negative control (NC) were implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient
  NTG mice (n = 8 per group). A The volumes of transplanted tumors were measured at
  the indicated time points and the tumor growth curves were plotted. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard error of mean. B Images of all xenograft tumors excised at day
  35 after tumor injection. C All tumor weights were measured. D-H The relative expression
  of miR-637 (D), WASH (E), IL-8 (F), stemness-related genes (G) and Ki67 (H) were
  examined by qRT-PCR, respectively. I IHC analysis of IL-8 and Ki67 expression in
  tumors. Scale bar, 40 μm. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. ns, not
  significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

  and serves as a novel prognostic marker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
