caption: Dynamics of expression of Notch signaling pathway components, Bmp2/Runx2
  factors, and hypoxic stress markers in cardiac mesenchymal cells obtained from healthy
  myocardium of sham-operated rats by quantitative PCR analysis. NX—healthy cells
  in a state of normoxia (n = 3); 5% HX—healthy cells in a state of hypoxia with an
  oxygen level of 5% (n = 3); 1% HX—healthy cells in a state of hypoxia with an oxygen
  level of 1% (n = 3). Horizontal—the time at which the cells were in hypoxic conditions.
  Vertical—the relative amount of mRNA, measured by the 2-ΔΔCT method; box plots with
  whiskers at min to the max are presented. * The asterisk shows significant differences
  between the control and the 5% HX and 1% HX groups at p < 0.05 (unpaired nonparametric
  Mann–Whitney test).
