caption: 'Platelet spreading and adhesion under flow conditions are defective in PT-VWD.
  (A) Representative images of human control and patient (PT-VWD) platelets 30 minutes
  after layering onto fibrinogen or collagen. Scale bar is 10 mm. Platelets were stained
  with FITC-conjugated phalloidin and analyzed using a Carl Zeiss Axio Observer.A1
  fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) with a 100x/1.4 Plan-Apochromat
  oil-immersion objective at room temperature. (B, C) Human (B) and murine (C) platelet
  spreading on glass coverslips coated with fibrinogen (100 mg/mL) or type I collagen
  (25 mg/mL). Spreading is expressed as percentage of surface covered by platelets.
  Data are means ± SEM from five independent experiments (Online Supplementary Table
  S1, samples A, B, C, D, E) or from n=5 mice (TgWT: two females and three males,
  mean platelet count: 661600±99984/mL; TgG233V: two females and three males; mean
  platelet count: 305000±26728/mL). **P<0.01; two-way ANOVA. The number of platelets
  that adhered to the surface was comparable between control and PT-VWD platelets
  (number of platelets adhering to fibrinogen per microscopic field: controls 93±27,
  PT-VWD 87±18, P=ns; number of platelets adhering to collagen per microscopic field:
  controls 78±17, PT-VWD 83±12, P=ns) and between TgWT and TgG233V platelets (number
  of platelets adhering to fibrinogen per microscopic field: TgWT 101±21, TgG233V
  105±24, P=ns; number of platelets adhering to collagen per microscopic field: TgWT
  98±9, TgG233V 91±13, P=ns). (D-E) Human (D) and murine (E) platelet adhesion to
  type I collagen under flow conditions. Whole blood was perfused at different shear
  rates in glass microcapillary tubes coated with type I collagen (30 mg/cm2). Specimens
  were observed under an optical microscope after fixation with 0.25% glutaric-dialdehyde
  and May-Grünwald/Giemsa staining. The total surface covered by platelets was calculated
  with ImageJ software. Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments (Online
  Supplementary Table S1, samples B, D, F) (D) or from n=3 mice (TgWT: three males,
  mean platelet count: 631550±21142/mL; TgG233V: three males; mean platelet count:
  350800±94469/mL) (E). *P<0.05, **P<0.01; two-way ANOVA.'
