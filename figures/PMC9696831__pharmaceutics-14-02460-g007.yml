caption: Lipidomics analysis on liver lipid metabolism after treatment of neddylation
  inhibitor MLN4924. (a) Huh7 cells were divided into FFA + DMSO and FFA + MLN4924
  groups. LC-MSâ€“based nontargeted metabolomic analysis detecting differential metabolites
  between two groups (n = 6 per group). (b) PLS-DA three-dimensional score plots for
  FFA + DMSO and FFA + MLN4924 groups. Images showed global sample distribution profiles
  analyzed by PLS-DA with the positive ion mode on the left and negative ion mode
  on the right. (c) Heatmap presented differentially expressed metabolites in FFA
  + DMSO group and FFA + MLN4924 group with the positive ion mode above and negative
  ion mode below. (d) Volcano plot showed lipidomics analysis of FFA + DMSO group
  and FFA + MLN4924 group with the positive ion mode on the left and negative ion
  mode on the right. The red dot represented the fold change (FC) > 2.0 and p value
  < 0.05. The green dot represents FC < 0.5, and p value < 0.05. (e) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis presented the main metabolic pathways identified between FFA
  + DMSO group and FFA + MLN4924 group by metabolites annotated to KEGG database.
