caption: 'SIRT1 regulates autophagy, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming. SIRT1
  directly deacetylates components of the autophagy (ATG5, ATG7, and ATG8) and inhibits
  the mTOR pathway to activate autophagy. The activation of AMPK-PGC-1α pathway induces
  the expression of SIRT1 and promotes autophagy activation. In addition, SIRT1-mediated
  deacetylation of AMPK inactivates ACC1 so that it decreases fatty acid synthesis
  during infection. The SIRT1/mTOR axis contributes to increased glycolysis, a disrupted
  TCA cycle, and altered inflammasomes in response to endotoxin. SIRT1 controls mitochondrial
  biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation by activating PGC-1α. Additionally, SIRT1
  regulates NF-κB signaling and pro-inflammatory T cell responses to alleviate EAE.
  SIRT1 is required for the endotoxin tolerance by deacetylating NF-κB during LPS
  stimulation. In dendritic cells, SIRT1 participates in T-cell differentiation, by
  modulating TGF-β1 and IL-12 production. In a murine model of allergy induced by
  ovalbumin-inhalation, SIRT1 regulates VEGF expression through the HIF-1α, thus controlling
  airway inflammation. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; ATG, autophagy-related
  gene; EAE, encephalomyelitis; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.'
