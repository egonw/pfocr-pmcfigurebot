caption: 'Artemisinin protected primary cultured neurons against OGD/RP induced injury
  via the ERK1/2. (A) Primary cultured neurons were pre-treated with different concentrations
  of artemisinin for 2 h and then induced with OGD for 4 hours followed by 20 hours
  of reperfusion. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Primary cultured neurons
  pretreated with 20 μM PD98059 for 30 min were treated with 12.5 μM artemisinin for
  2 hours and then induced with OGD for 4 hours followed by 20 hours of reperfusion.
  Cell viability was determined by MTT assay (B), LDH release was measured by LDH
  assay (C), Cell apoptosis detected by Hoechst 33342 staining (D, E) and Caspase
  3 activity (G). Scale bar: 100 μm. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
  mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were measured by DCFH-DA and JC-1 assays
  (F, H, I). Scale bar: 100 μm and 150μm. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, versus
  ctrl group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, versus model group; & p < 0.05,
  &&& p < 0.001, versus ART+ model group were considered significantly different.
  The assay was repeated at least 3 times.'
