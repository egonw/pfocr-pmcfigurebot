caption: 'Illustration of the “Phoenix Rising” pathway of wound healing and tissue
  regeneration. Damage in tissues leads to the activation of Caspase 3/7, which cleaves
  and activates iPLA2 and increased production of arachidonic acid, a precursor for
  the production of PGE2, a known stimulating signal for stem cell growth and tissue
  regeneration. From , PMID: 20179271.'
