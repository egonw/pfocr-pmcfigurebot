caption: MiR-383-5p targets DDIT4 and inhibits its expression. (A) Starbase prediction
  target; (B) the targeting relationship between miR-383-5p and DDIT4 was examined
  by a luciferase-reporter gene analysis; (C) the level of DDIT4 was measured by Western
  blot. Compared to the NC or NC inhibitor group, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. NC, normal
  control; DDIT4, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4.
article_title: Resveratrol inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration, and
  induces the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through the MALAT1/miR-383-5p/DDIT4
  signaling pathway.
