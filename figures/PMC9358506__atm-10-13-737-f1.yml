caption: Identification of DEGs for enrichment analysis. (A) Experimental flow chart.
  (B) Heatmap of DEGs between the CLP and sham samples. Red areas represent high expression,
  and green areas represent low expression. (C) Volcano plot of DEGs between the CLP
  and sham samples. The red plots represent upregulated genes, the green plots represent
  downregulated genes, and the gray plots represent nonsignificant genes. (D) GO pathway
  enrichment analyses of DEGs. The bar graph shows the top 10 (red for biological
  processes and blue for molecular function) and the top 9 (green for cellular component)
  enriched GO pathways. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs. The bubble plot
  shows the most enriched KEGG pathways. The closer the color of a dot is to red,
  the smaller its P value is, and the closer the color is to green, the larger the
  P value is. CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  DEGs, differentially expressed genes; m6A, N6-adenosine methylation; KEGG, Kyoto
