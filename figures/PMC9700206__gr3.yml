caption: Hypotheses explaining lignin modification-induced dwarfism (LMID) in forest
  trees.First, LMID might be caused by impaired functioning of TEs, resulting in perturbed
  water and nutrient transport in the stem. Second, a block in the phenylpropanoid
  pathway could lead to the accumulation of growth-inhibitory compounds or prevent
  the biosynthesis of compounds essential for growth. Third, alterations in the cell
  wall might be detected by cell-wall integrity sensors that activate a transcriptional
  response requiring Mediator (Med). TF, transcription factor; Pol II, RNA polymerase
  II.
