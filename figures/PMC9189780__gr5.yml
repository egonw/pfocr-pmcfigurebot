caption: 'DNTTIP1 recruits HDAC1 to suppress the expression of DUSP2. (a) The ChIP-qPCR
  analysis of the occupancies of H3K27-Ac, H3K27-Me3, and Pol II on the DUSP2 promoter
  in HK1 cells stably expressing control or shRNA-DNTTIP1. (b, h) The indicated stable
  cells transfected with the DUSP2-Luc reporter for 48h were subjected to the luciferase
  activity assay. (c) The relative mRNA levels of DUSP2 were normalized to the GAPDH
  level in the indicated stable cells as determined by qRT-PCR. (d-e, i) The indicated
  proteins were analyzed by Western blotting in the indicated stable cells. (f) The
  co-IP assay was performed in HK1 cells expressing endogenous levels of DNTTIP1 using
  anti-DNTTIP1 antibody or anti-IgG antibody as indicated. (g) The ChIP-qPCR analysis
  of the occupancies of HDAC1 or HDAC2 on the DUSP2 promoter in HK1 cells stably expressing
  control or shRNA-DNTTIP1. (j) Migration and invasion abilities were determined using
  the indicated stable cells. Scale bar: 50μm. (k) The correlation between DNTTIP1
  and DUSP2 expression in 70 NPC tissues. (l) Correlation between DNTTIP1 and DUSP2
  protein levels in 10 NPC tissues according to Western blotting. (a-c, g, h, j) Representative
  data of three independent experiments. Data are represented as the mean ± SD. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, no significance using Student''s t-test.
  (d-f, i, l) Western Blot bands were derived from three separate experiments but
  only one representative loading control is shown.'
