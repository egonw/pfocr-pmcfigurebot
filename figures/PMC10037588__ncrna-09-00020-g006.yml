caption: KEGG pathway view of islet-genes that are experimentally validated targets
  of miR-148a-3p, miR-375, and miR-7-5p. All islet-genes that are experimentally validated
  targets of miR-148a-3p, miR-375, and miR-7 were put into Pathview to generate a
  KEGG pathway graph of the insulin signaling pathway (hsa04910). If the node of a
  protein is labeled in white, no targets from the three miRNAs is involved in regulating
  this protein. Nodes labeled from yellow to green to red indicate that an increased
  number of targets are correlated with the protein at this node in the pathway.
