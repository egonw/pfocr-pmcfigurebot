figure_title: The antitumor effect of PARP inhibitors
caption: a PARP1 participates in multiple cellular processes, such as DNA repair,
  transcription, chromatin modification, and DNA replication. These roles facilitate
  genomic stability. b The interaction of PARP inhibitors and genetic aberrations
  in double-strand breaks (DSBs). PARP inhibitors induce DSBs by trapping PARP1 on
  DNA. The induced DSBs can be repaired via the HR or NHEJ pathway. Alternatively,
  impaired DNA repair function, especially impaired HR function, promotes the accumulation
  of DNA lesions and ultimately leads to cell death. Impaired DNA repair function
  is due to gene alterations such as BRCA1/2 mutations, ATM alterations, and CHD1
  deletion. Androgen receptor inhibition (ADi) also exerts a synergistic effect with
  PARP inhibitors by impairing DNA repair function. c Synthetic lethality can be induced
  by PARP inhibitors under specific conditions. In HR-proficient cells, the DSBs induced
  by PARP inhibitors can be repaired by the proficient HR function. These types of
  cells are resistant to PARP inhibitors. However, alterations in genes associated
  with the HR function or the addition of a specific combination agent may induce
  cells toward the HRD phenotype. Under these conditions, PARP inhibitors can induce
  lethality. SSB single-strand break, SSBR/BER single-strand break repair/base excision
