caption: Lymphocyte metabolic pathway during the cell cycle. T cells go through glycolysis
  metabolic pathway in phase G1 and consume glutamate and citrate to generate phospholipids.
  In phase S, T cells need to duplicate their genome and serine to synthesize nucleotides.
  Pyrimidine synthesis occurs only in the S phase and it is required to enter into
  G2. IN phase G2 and M, T cells need more energy to grow in size and consume acetyl-CoA
  to generate more ATP.
