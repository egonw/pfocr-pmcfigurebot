caption: 'Up‐regulation of hsa_circ_0072309 and ACKR3, and down‐regulation of miR‐100
  in brain metastases of NSCLC patients. Graphs showing the relative RNA expression
  of hsa_circ_0072309 (A), ACKR3 (B), and miR‐100 (C) in clinical tissue specimens
  from NSCLC patients as detected by qPCR. *** versus Normal lung tissues, p < 0.001;
  ### versus NSCLC BM+ lung tissues, p < 0.001; $$$ versus NSCLC BM− lung tissues,
  p < 0.001. (D) Representative Western blot showing the expression of ACKR3 in clinical
  tissue specimens. (E) Immunohistochemistry staining of ACKR3 in clinical tissue
  specimens with brown stains indicating positivity (scale bar:100 μm; magnification:
  ×200).'
article_title: Circulating hsa_circ_0072309, acting via the miR‐100/ACKR3 pathway,
  maybe a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain
  metastasis from non‐small‐cell lung cancer.
