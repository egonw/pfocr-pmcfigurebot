caption: Metformin activates the AMPK/NLRP3 signaling pathway and inhibits inflammation
  after SCI. (a–c) Representative Western blots and quantification data of the levels
  of p-AMPK and p-ACC after SCI from each group. All data represent the mean ± SD,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3. (d–h) Representative Western blots and quantification data
  of the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase 1, and IL-1β after SCI from each group.
  All data represent the mean ± SD, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3. (i, j) Immunohistochemical
  detection of the levels of NLRP3 protein in each group of rats at 7 days after SCI.
  Scale bars represent 100 μm. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3. (k–m) ELISA was used to detect
  the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the spinal cord tissue homogenate from
  each group. All data represent the mean ± SD, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 3.
