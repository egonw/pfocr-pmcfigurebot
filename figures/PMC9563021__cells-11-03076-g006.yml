caption: 'Effect of baicalin on levels of phosphorylated P38 MAPK (a) and Fas (b)
  in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Levels of phosphorylated P38 MAPK and Fas
  were measured via flow cytometric analysis. Values are presented as mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. Nor, normal group (media only); Con, control group
  (1 µg/mL of LPS alone). BN10, BN25, and BN50 are 10, 25, and 50 µM of baicalin,
  respectively; BA, baicalein (25 µM). # p < 0.05 vs. Nor; *** p < 0.001 vs. Con;
  ** p < 0.01 vs. Con.'
