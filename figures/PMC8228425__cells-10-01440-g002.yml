caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of rAION responses. Pathways evaluated by Ingenuity
  software package (http://www.ingenuity.com (accessed on 29 August 2020)). (A) Comparison
  between naïve and rAION-induced, vehicle-injected ONHs. B) Comparison between rAION-induced,
  vehicle-injected and rAION-induced, PGJ2-treated animals. The log p-value response
  threshold for significance is set at 1.5 fold. Orange signal represents upregulation;
  blue signal represents downregulation; and white represents equivalent expression
  levels of pathway members altered both up- and downregulated, while grey signal
  represents uninterpretable (inconsistent) pathway response. In (A), comparison between
  naïve and vehicle gene sets reveals strong upregulation of interferon-associated
  pathway signaling, neuroinflammation and dendritic cell maturation pathway signaling,
  with moderate upregulation of components associated with both the Th1 and Th2 pathways.
  There is strong downregulation of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint (=mitotic upregulation),
  liver-X and retinoic acid (LXR/RXR) pathway components. LXRs are inhibitors of inflammation.
  In (B), following PGJ2 treatment after rAION, there is suppression of the neuroinflammation,
  TLR and TREM-macrophage and -neutrophil signaling pathways, as well as suppression
  of leukocyte extravasation and Th1 signaling, but not Th2. The decrease in NF-κB
  signaling confirms PGJ2’s known role in suppression of this system.
