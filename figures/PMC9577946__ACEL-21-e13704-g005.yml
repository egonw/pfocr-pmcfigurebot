caption: Signaling pathways related to Bmal1 deficiency in AD and associated aging‐related
  diseases. Dark gray represents the direct link from Bmal1 to NAD+ and SIRT1. Light
  gray represents the indirect link between Bmal1 to NAD+ and SIRT1. Direct evidence
  suggested that the SIRT1‐BMAL1 pathway was involved in PD and OA, and indirect evidence
  indicated that the SIRT1‐BMAL1 pathway may involve in other aging‐related diseases
  such as AD. Bmal1 deficiency in the pancreas contributed to T2DM via accumulated
  ROS mediated by the mitochondrial signaling pathway. In the artery, ROS accumulation
  was aggravated by Bmal1 deficiency through NF‐κB signaling and BMP‐mediated signaling,
  leading to the progression of AS. Bmal1 loss in macrophages enhanced hypertensive
  vascular remodeling in hypertension through the IL4‐STAT6 signaling pathway. Bmal1
  deficiency in cartilage exacerbated OA through interaction with multiple signaling
  pathways, which included the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway, TGF‐β and NFATC2 signaling
  pathway, HIF1α‐VEGF pathway, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. There may exist other
  potential Bmal1‐dependent signaling pathways involved in aging‐related diseases.
