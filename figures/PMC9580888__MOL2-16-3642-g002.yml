caption: Scheme summarizing the effects of SGPL1 ablation in MEFs. In the absence
  of SGPL1, accumulated S1P is secreted by the cells []. By binding to S1PR1–3, it
  elicits signaling cascades that promote increased expression of proteins involved
  in glucose uptake and breakdown via aerobic glycolysis. This and the high energy
  state of the cells promote activation of Akt/mTOR pathway leading to decreased autophagy.
  Shown are the sites affected by the S1PR antagonists VPC and JTE as well as the
  Akt inhibitor AktIn and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. See text for further explanations.
  ABC, ATP‐binding cassette transporters; HIF‐1, hypoxia‐inducible factor 1; p‐Akt,
  phospho‐Akt; p‐mTOR, phospho‐mTOR; Spns2, spinster 2.
