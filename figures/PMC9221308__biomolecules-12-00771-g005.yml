caption: Effect of PTK2 siRNA on the expression of FAK, type III collagen, elastin,
  and fibronectin in gingival fibroblasts. HGnFs were transfected with PTK2 siRNA
  or its negative control (NC) (a). The mRNA expression of col III, elastin, and FN
  was quantified 5 days after treatment with PTK2 siRNA (b–e). Each bar indicates
  mean ± standard deviation (SD) of five independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01.
