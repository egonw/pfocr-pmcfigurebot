caption: 'The ASFV I10L protein (pI10L) regulates the formation of the IKKβ-IκBα-p65
  complex. (A) The ASFV pI10L has no effect on the expression of NEMO. HEK293T cells
  were transfected with various concentrations of the pI10L-expressing plasmid followed
  by immunoblotting analysis. (B–F) The ASFV pI10L inhibits the interaction between
  IKKβ and IκBα or p65, but does not regulate the assembly of the NF-κB or IKK complex.
  HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmids: pHA-NEMO, -p65, or -p50, pHis-pI10L,
  pMyc-NEMO, pFlag-IKKβ, or -p65 for 24 hours. Myc-NEMO, Flag-IKKβ or Flag-p65 was
  then used as bait protein to perform co-IP and immunoblotting analysis. (G) The
  ASFV pI10L inhibits the IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 in a dose-dependent
  manner. HEK293T cells were transfected with various concentrations of the pI10L-expressing
  plasmid (0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 µg) and the IKKβ-expressing plasmid (0.1 µg). Twenty
  hours later, the cells were collected, and immunoblotting analysis was performed.
  (H) The ASFV pI10L suppresses the IKKβ kinase activity towards IκBα and p65. The
  Flag-tagged IKKβ, IκBα, p65, or pI10L were purified and subjected to in vitro kinase
  assay, followed by immunoblotting analysis. Densitometric analysis of the protein
  expression level was performed with ImageJ software.'
