caption: 'Oncopathways and genomic breakpoints analysis. (A,B) Frequency plot of oncopathways
  affected in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant samples, shown left to right,
  fraction of the pathway affected and the fraction of samples that present an event
  located in these pathways. There are not the same oncopathways affected between
  the two response groups. (C) Gene Breakpoint analysis, derived from CNVKIT: Top
  20 most frequent genes of all the genes that had breakpoints in the whole cohort.
  (D) Oncoplot with most frequent breakpoints in genes that greatly separated the
  two conditions. The fold change is the log-ratio of the fraction of patients between
  resistant and sensitive that have those breakpoints. Log2 (fraction of breakpoints
  in resistant)/(fraction of breakpoints in sensitive).'
