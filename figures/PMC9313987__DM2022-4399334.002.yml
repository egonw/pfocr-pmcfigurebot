caption: The GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment. (a) The barplot
  of top 20 items identified by GO functional enrichment. (b) The dotplot of top 20
  items identified by GO functional enrichment. (c) The barplot of top 20 items identified
  by KEGG pathway enrichment. (d) The dotplot of top 20 items identified by KEGG pathway
  enrichment. The color of the bubble and column is associated with the P value, and
  the size of bubble is related to the ratio of target gene. (e) PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway enriched in KEGG pathway analysis.
