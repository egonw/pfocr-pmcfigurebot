caption: RNF128 promotes cell proliferation in colorectal cancer. (A) Cell proliferation
  was analyzed by CCK-8 assay, and cell viability was detected at 24, 48, and 72 h.
  LoVo and HCT116 cells were transfected with si-NC and si-RNF128. (B) Cell colony
  formation assays were used to observe the tumor formation ability of LoVo and HCT116
  cells transfected with si-NC and si-RNF128. **P<0.001.
article_title: Ring finger protein 128 promotes, rather than inhibits, colorectal
  cancer progression by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.
