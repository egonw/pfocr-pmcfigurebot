caption: 'Effect of baicalin treatment of RAW 264.7 cells on hydrogen peroxide production.
  Macrophages were treated for 24 h (A) and 48 h (B). Values are presented as mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. Nor, normal group incubated with media only;
  Con, control group treated with 1 µg/mL of LPS only; BN10, BN25, and BN50 are 10,
  25, and 50 µM of baicalin, respectively; BA, baicalein (25 µM). # p < 0.05 vs. Nor;
  *** p < 0.001 vs. Con.'
