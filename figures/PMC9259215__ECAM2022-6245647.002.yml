caption: FSCN1 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and EMT. (a) qRT-PCR
  for the detection of the mRNA expression of FSCN1 in PC-3 cells transfected with
  si-NC, si-FSCN1#1, and si-FSCN1#2, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs si-NC; (b, c) western blot for
  the examination of the protein expression level of FSCN1 in PC-3 cells after si-NC,
  si-FSCN1#1, and si-FSCN1#2 transfection, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs si-NC; (d) qRT-PCR to detect
  the mRNA expression level of FSCN1 in DU145 cells in groups of mock and FSCN1, ∗∗P
  < 0.01; (e, f) western blot for determining the protein expression level of FSCN1
  in DU145 cells in the mock group and the FSCN1 group; (g) transwell to measure the
  invasion ability of PC-3 cells in groups of si-NC, si-FSCN1#, and si-FSCN1#2 and
  DU145 cells in groups of mock and FSCN1; (h) scratch test for evaluating the migration
  ability of PC-3 cells in the si-NC group, si-FSCN1#1 group, and si-FSCN1#2 group
  and DU145 cells in the mock group and the FSCN1 group; (i, j) western blot to determine
  the protein expression level of E-cadherin, vimentin, and snail in PC-3 cells in
  the si-NC group, si-FSCN1#1 group, and si-FSCN1#2 group, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs si-NC; (k,
  l) western blot for detecting the protein expression level of E-cadherin, vimentin,
  and snail in DU145 cells in the mock group and the FSCN1 group, ∗∗P < 0.01.
