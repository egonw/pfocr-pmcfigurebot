caption: 'DEMs analysis after lncFAM200B overexpression. (A) The Venn diagrams of
  the DEMs between Ad_lnc200B and Ad_G. (B) Clustering map of DEMs. Statistics of
  adipogenesis-related pathway and main GO terms in DEMs targets. (C) Analysis of
  DEMs in adipogenesis-related KEGG pathway. The thickness of the line is negatively
  correlated with the padj. (D) Main GO term in the DEMs target. # marks the up-regulated
  DEMs, the others are down-regulated DEMs.'
