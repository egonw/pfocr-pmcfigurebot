caption: p53 and senescence promote profibrotic pathways following hepatic radiation.Regulation
  of genes within the p53 pathway (A), and cellular senescence (B) at the different
  time points. p16INK4a (Cdkn2a) staining 20-weeks post-irradiation at 0.5x and 35x
  (C). Heat map of regulated SASP (D). Regulation of genes within the extracellular
  matrix organization (E). ECM, extracellular matrix; SASP, senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype.
