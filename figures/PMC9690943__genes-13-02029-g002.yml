caption: 'CRISPR repair mechanism. Classic CRISPR mechanism comprising the guide RNA
  (gRNA), target DNA, and endonuclease (Cas9), which promotes DNA cleavage by DSBs
  induced by Cas9. DSBs can be repaired by two main mechanisms: the NHEJ mechanism,
  where the ends of the strands come together (this is subject to unwanted insertions
  or deletions), or by the HDR pathway, which uses the recombination donor DNA templates
  to reconstitute the DSB.'
