caption: Autophagic flux does not contribute to the acute oxidative stress response
  in differentiating lt-NES cells. (A,B) Crosstalk between autophagy and KEAP1-NRF2
  pathway regulation. (A) Western blot analysis of NRF2 and KEAP1 protein levels across
  lt-NES differentiation upon autophagic flux inhibition (by Bafilomycin) for 17 h.
  (B) NRF2 pathway downstream target gene expression under OS induction upon autophagic
  flux inhibition. lt-NES cells were differentiated for 10 weeks and pre-treated with
  Bafilomycin for 17 h, followed by addition of TBHP in the presence of Bafilomycin
  for 8 h. Cells were treated with TBHP only for 8 h as a control treatment. Expression
  of the NRF2 downstream target genes NQO1 and TXNRD1 was analyzed by qRT-PCR in order
  to analyze the effects on NRF2 pathway activation upon oxidative stress (TBHP) under
  basal conditions or during autophagy inhibition. Results are presented in comparison
  to the corresponding pre-treatment condition (Bafilomycin or pre-treatment control;
  equal to 1). Data are normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and presented as means ± SEM
  (n = 4 per treatment condition). Significant difference between means for each treatment
  condition was determined by Student’s t test (NQO1 p = 0.5991; TXNRD1 p = 0.5257).
  (C) Autophagic flux response to 24 h TBHP IC20 treatment in lt-NES and lt-NES cultures
  differentiated up to 12 weeks quantified by CYTO-ID® staining shows that TBHP treatment
  does not induce upregulation of the autophagosomal flux. The autophagosomal load
  was assessed by calculating the ratio of autophagosomes to nuclei (n = 3, consisting
  of at least 3 technical replicates per treatment condition each). (C’) Representative
  CYTO-ID® staining images of 12-week-differentiated lt-NES cultures show no increase
  in autophagosomal load upon TBHP treatment. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
  (D) ATPlite assay of pooled 10–12-week-differentiated lt-NES cells treated with
  TBHP with or without Bafilomycin. Cells were pre-treated with Bafilomycin for 17
  h followed by a 24 h TBHP treatment. Cell viability was assessed at the end of the
  treatment by ATPlite assay. Results are presented as percentages relative to untreated
  cells (equal to 100%) ±SEM (n = 5, consisting of at least 3 technical replicates
  per treatment condition). Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA (p = 0.89).
