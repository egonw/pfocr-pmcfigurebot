figure_title: HGF/c-Met pathway facilitates the perineural invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by activating the mTOR/NGF axis
caption: A Activating the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway upregulated NGF expression via
  activating mTOR. Pancreatic cancer cells can recruit nerves and facilitate cancer
  cell invasion of nerves by increasing the expression of NGF. On the other hand,
  activating the HGF/c-Met/mTOR signaling can increase the invasion and migration
  ability of pancreatic cancer cells by upregulating N-cadherin and Vimentin but downregulating
  E-cadherin. It will facilitate cancer cells invading nerves. B Pancreatic cancer
  cells with high expression of c-Met can invade nerves more easily and metastasize
  farther along the nerve. Blocking the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway suppresses cancer
  cell invasion nerves and metastasis along nerves to distant places.
