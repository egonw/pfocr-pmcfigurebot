caption: 'Effects of Si-Miao-Yong-an (SMYA) on the percentage of the positive area
  of Wnt1, β-catenin and Cyclin D1 proteins in the aortic root plaques of mice. (a)
  the Localization of Wnt1, β-catenin and Cyclin D1 proteins in mice as plaques were
  observed by immunohistochemical staining. Wnt1 protein was mainly located in the
  cell membrane and cytoplasm, the β-catenin protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm
  and nucleus, and Cyclin D1 protein was mainly located in the nucleus, all of which
  showed brown granules (optical microscope, ×400). (b-d) after SMYA intervention,
  the percentages of Wnt1, β-catenin and Cyclin D1 protein-positive areas were significantly
  reduced. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01, compared with the normal control
  (NC) group. ##p < 0.01, compared with the model group.'
