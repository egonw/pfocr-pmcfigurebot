caption: Identification of metabolic enzymes regulated by PP2A.A, the numbers of significantly
  changed metabolic enzymes including I, II, and III enzymes in transcriptomics and
  phosphoproteomics are shown as upregulated (orange) or downregulated (blue) DEGs
  or phosphoproteins, respectively. B, toxicity function analysis was conducted using
  IPA platform based on the metabolic DEGs in phase I/I and phase III metabolic enzymes,
  respectively. Toxicity pathway analysis with p < 0.05 was considered significantly
  enriched. C, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to verify the mRNA level of
  45 metabolic enzyme genes in WT and HO mouse liver tissues (mean ± SD, n = 3). Relative
  mRNA levels were presented in the heatmap and as fold change relative to WT mice
  and shown as upregulated (orange) or downregulated (green) gene expression. D, the
  immunoblotting analysis of indicated proteins in liver tissue from WT and HO mouse.
  E, the representative images were shown for liver sections stained with MDR1 or
  ABCG2 antibody (400× magnification; the scale bar represents 50 μm). Quantification
  of MDR1- or ABCG2-stained area expressed as a percentage of liver fields occupied
  (mean ± SD, n = 5). DEG, differentially expressed gene; HO, homozygous knockout;
  IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.
