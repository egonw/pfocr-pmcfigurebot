caption: Workflow and circRNA tools comparison. (a) Bioinformatic workflow of the
  ceRNA interaction network. The pipeline is depicted from the RNA-seq fastq files
  to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Five different software packages were employed
  to identify circRNAs. mRNAs affected by ceRNAs were predicted by their interaction
  with miRNAs. Differential expression analysis with DESeQ2 was used to decipher differences
  in responses to immunotherapy. (b) Venn diagram with the number of different cirRNAs
  detected by each software. (c) UpSet plot showing the maximum number of identified
  circRNAs with each software combination.
