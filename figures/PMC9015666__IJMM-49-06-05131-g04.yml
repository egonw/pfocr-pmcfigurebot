caption: TPCA-1, a potent inhibitor of IKKβ protein, induces Het-1A and KYSE-450 cell
  apoptosis. (A) Effects of TPCA-1 on KYSE-450 cell apoptosis, as indicated by flow
  cytometric analyses. (B) Western blot analysis of the expression of proteins in
  the NF-κB signaling pathway and apoptosis markers in Het-1A and KYSE-450 cells.
  The effects of short- and long-term exposures on IKKβ and IκBα are presented. The
  percentage of cleaved caspase 3 was measured by ImageJ with images of full-length
  and cleaved caspase 3 at the same exposure duration. (C) Mechanistic model for TPCA-1-induced
  apoptosis through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. TPCA-1, 2-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide;
  Q, quadrant; p-p65, phosphorylated p65.
