caption: Nrf2 participates in cisplatin-induced HEI-OC1 cell death. (a) Western blots
  of Nrf2, KEAP1, and GAPDH after cisplatin treatment for different lengths of time.
  (b) Western blot confirming Nrf2 KO in the desired cell line. (c) Control and Nrf2
  KO cells were treated with 25 μM tBHQ for 24 h. (d) Control and Nrf2 KO cells treated
  with varying concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h were analyzed by CCK-8 assays.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
