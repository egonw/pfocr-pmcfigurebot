caption: 'AWestern blot analysis of endogenous DLK, p‐cJun, Rab6 and GAPDH, and quantification
  of relative c‐Jun phosphorylation levels in 3DIV cultured embryonic DRG neurons
  treated with dynasore (DYN) or brefeldin A (BFA) for 3 h in the presence or absence
  of NGF (n = 6–12 biological replicates; series of unpaired t‐tests /Mann–Whitney
  U tests with control NGF withdrawal followed by a Holm–Sidak correction).BRepresentative
  Western blots of p‐MKK4, MKK4 and GAPDH, and quantifications of the relative MKK4
  phosphorylation levels in 3DIV cultured embryonic DRG neurons treated with dynasore
  (DYN) for 3 h in the presence or absence of NGF (n = 6 biological replicates, series
  of unpaired t‐tests with control NGF withdrawal followed by a Holm–Sidak correction).C–FRepresentative
  stills (C), kymographs (D) and quantification of the orientation (E) and number
  of DLK‐GFP positive particles (F) from time‐lapse recordings of DIV6 DRG neurons
  overexpressing GFP‐tagged DLK and treated with dynasore (DYN) or brefeldin A (BFA)
  for 3 h (n = 34–101 neurons, Chi‐square test in E and series of Mann–Whitney tests
  with control followed by a Holm–Sidak correction in F). Arrowheads in C point to
  individual DLK‐GFP positive structures.G, HRepresentative Western blots of DLK,
  α‐tubulin and Na+/K+‐ATPase (G) and quantifications (H) from cytosolic and membrane
  fractions of 3DIV cultured embryonic DRG neurons treated with dynasore (DYN) for
  3 h in the absence of NGF (n = 5–11 biological replicates, series of unpaired t‐tests
  /Mann–Whitney U tests with control NGF withdrawal followed by a Holm–Sidak correction).I–KRepresentative
  stills (I), kymographs (J) and quantification of the number of DLK‐GFP positive
  particles (K) from cultured embryonic DRG neurons treated with chlorpromazine (CHP),
  dansylcadaverine (DCV) or methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin (MCD) for 3 h (n = 12 neurons, series
  of Mann–Whitney U tests with control situation followed by a Holm–Sidak correction).
  Arrowheads in I point to individual DLK‐GFP positive structures.LRepresentative
  Western blots of p‐cJun and GAPDH, and quantification of relative c‐Jun phosphorylation
  levels in 3DIV cultured embryonic DRG neurons treated with chlorpromazine (CHP),
  dansylcadaverine (DCV) or methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin (MCD) for 3 h in the absence of
  NGF (n = 6–24 biological replicates, series of Mann–Whitney U tests with control
  NGF withdrawal followed by a Holm–Sidak correction).MRepresentative Western blots
  of p‐cJun and GAPDH, and quantification of relative c‐Jun phosphorylation levels
  in 3DIV cultured embryonic DRG neurons treated with vincristine (VNC) and dynasore
  (DYN) for 3 h (n = 7 biological replicates, series of Mann–Whitney U tests with
  vincristine condition followed by a Holm–Sidak correction). Data information: All
  graphs represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. Scale bar represents
