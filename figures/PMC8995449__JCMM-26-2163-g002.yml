caption: Nur77 deletion facilitates bone loss and osteoclastogenesis. (A‐C) Body weights
  and body compositions of the mice (n = 10). (D‐K) A three‐dimensional image of the
  femoral metaphysis trabecular bone (bottom), a two‐dimensional image of the entire
  distal femur trabecular bone (top) and quantification of the trabecular bone volume
  and architecture (n = 5), scale bar =0.3 mm. BV/TV, bone volume/tissue volume ratio;
  Tb. N, trabecular number; Tb. Th, trabecular thickness; Tb. Sp, trabecular separation;
  Conn. Dn, connectivity density; Tb. Pf, trabecular pattern factor; SMI, structure
  model index. (L‐M) Histomorphometric analysis by H&E staining (L) and TRAP staining
  (M). (N) Numbers of osteoclasts in Nur77 knockout and wild‐type littermate controls.
  Multinucleated TRAP+ (red) cells were identified as mature osteoclasts. (O‐R) The
  mRNA expression levels of osteoclast differentiation‐related factors, including
  NFATC1, ACP5, Ctsk and Car2, in the femurs of Nur77 knockout and wild‐type littermate
  controls (n = 5). Animal experiments were conducted using 8‐month‐old male mice.
  All data are shown as boxplots with medians and interquartile ranges and were statistically
  analysed by Student's t‐test. *p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 or p < 0.001
