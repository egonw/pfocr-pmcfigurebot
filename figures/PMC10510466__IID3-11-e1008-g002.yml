caption: 'Oxycodone activated the Keap1/Nrf2/HO‐1 signaling pathway and ML385 reversed
  the effects. Human endometrial stromal cells (hEndoSCs) were exposed to mifepristone
  for 48 h, and then treated with oxycodone (10 μg/mL) and/or a Keap1/Nrf2/HO‐1 inhibitor
  (5 μM ML385) for 24 h. Cells were divided into four groups: mifepristone, mifepristone + oxycodone‐10,
  mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + DMSO, or mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + ML385. (A)
  Detection of Keap1, Nrf2, HO‐1, and NQO1 expression by western blot analysis. (B–E)
  Statistical analysis of Keap1, Nrf2, HO‐1, and NQO1 levels. Reverse transcription
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of Keap1 (F), Nrf2 (G), HO‐1 (H),
  and NQO1 (I) levels. N = 3. **p < .01 versus mifepristone; ##p < .01 versus the
  mifepristone + oxycodone‐10 + DMSO group. Experiments were repeated three times,
  and the data were presented as means ± SD.'
