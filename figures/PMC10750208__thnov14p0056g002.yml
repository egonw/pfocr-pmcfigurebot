caption: 'Specific induction of mitophagy by ALT001 independent of the canonical mitophagy
  pathway. (A-B) BEAS-2B cells expressing mt-Keima (A) or Keima (B) were treated with
  ALT001 (15 μM) for 18 h, and mitophagy levels were analyzed by confocal microscopy.
  Scale bar: 10 μm. (C) HeLa cells expressing Parkin and mitoYFP, ER-GFP, Golgi-eGFP,
  or Turquoise2-Peroxi were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for 24 h. Scale bar: 10 μm.
  (D) BEAS-2B cells were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for 24 h, and western blot analysis
  was performed using the indicated antibodies. Numbers below the corresponding blot
  represent densitometric analysis normalized to Actin. (E-F) BEAS-2B cells were treated
  with ALT001 (15 μM) for 24 h and further incubated until the indicated time points.
  Mitochondrial mass was measured by NAO staining (E), and western blot analysis was
  performed using the indicated antibodies (F). Numbers below the corresponding blot
  represent densitometric analysis normalized to Actin. (G) BEAS-2B cells were treated
  with either CCCP (10 μM) or ALT001 (15 μM) for the indicated time and western blot
  analysis was performed using LC3B and Actin antibodies. (H) HEK293 cells expressing
  EGFP-LC3 were treated with either CCCP (10 μM) or ALT001 (15 μM) for the indicated
  time, and EGFP-LC3 puncta were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The LC3 puncta number
  per cell from three experiments is shown as the mean ± SD (0 h, n = 40; ALT001 6
  h, n = 29; 24 h, n = 31; CCCP 6 h, n = 39; CCCP 24 h, n = 21). (I) Wild-type (WT)
  and ATG7 knockout (ATG7 KO) HeLa cells expressing Parkin were treated with either
  CCCP (10 μM) for 2 h or ALT001 (15 μM) for 24 h, and mitophagy levels were analyzed
  by flow cytometry. (J) BEAS-2B expressing mt-Keima cells expressing control nontargeting
  shRNA (shNT) or PINK1 shRNA (shPINK1) were treated with either CCCP (10 μM) for
  6 h or ALT001 (15 μM) for 24 h, and mitophagy levels were analyzed by flow cytometry.
  The results from three biological replicates (A-F, I-J) or four biological replicates
  (G) are shown as the mean ± SD. Significance was determined by Student''s t test
  (A-C) or one-way (E, H) two-way ANOVA (I, J) with Šidák''s multiple-comparison test.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. NS, not significant.'
