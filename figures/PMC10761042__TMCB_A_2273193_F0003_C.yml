caption: PTP1B dephosphorylates a Cdk3 derived peptide in vitro and both proteins
  interact in GB cells. (A) The in vitro activity of PTP1B against a phosphopeptide
  corresponding to residues 9-21 of Cdk3 (KIGEGTpYGVVYKA) was determined by using
  a malachite-green based assay. An IR β phosphopeptide (TRDIpYETDYYRK) was used as
  positive control and the nonphosphorylated peptides of Cdk3 and IR β were used as
  negative controls. Each assay was independently repeated with four replicates and
  the nmol of phosphate released were calculated. Data are presented as means ± SE.
  (B). Assessment of Cdk3 activity in Ptp1b +/+ and Ptp1b −/− MEFs. Cell lysates were
  subjected to Western blot with anti-PTP1B, anti-Cdk3 or anti-phospho Cdk3 antibodies.
  GAPDH was used as loading control. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed
  wild-type or trapping mutant PTP1B and Cdk3. Cell lysates of transfected cells incubated
  with or without 1 mM of sodium orthovanadate were subjected to immunoprecipitation
  with anti-myc or isotype control IgG antibodies and the presence of Cdk3 in the
  complex was assessed with anti-HA antibodies. The presence of PTP1B and Cdk3 in
  cell extracts prior to immunoprecipitation was verified using specific antibodies
  (input). (D) Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous PTP1B and Cdk3. LN229, U87-MG
  and U251 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PTP1B or isotype
  control IgG antibodies and the presence of Cdk3 in the complex was assessed with
  anti-Cdk3 antibodies. The presence of PTP1B and Cdk3 in cell extracts prior to immunoprecipitation
  was verified using specific antibodies (input). (E) The physical interaction between
  endogenously expressed PTP1B and Cdk3 in LN229, U87-MG and U251 GB cells was determined
  using proximity ligation assays. The figure shows representative confocal microscopy
  images in which PTP1B-Cdk3 interactions appear as individual fluorescent red dots
  (lower panels). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit isotype IgG antibodies were used as negative
  controls (upper panels).
