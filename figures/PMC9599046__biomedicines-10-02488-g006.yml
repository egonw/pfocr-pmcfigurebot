caption: 'AKT activation results in the cytoplasmic translocation of FOXA2: (a) Immunoblotting
  for AKT and p-AKT protein expression in CD44 knockdown and overexpressed MDA-MB-231
  and MCF7 cells, respectively. (b) Immunoblotting for the cytoplasmic and nuclear
  expression of p-AKT and FOXA2 in CD44 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. (c) Immunoblotting
  for the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression of p-AKT and FOXA2 in Veh (DMSO
  used as the vehicle), wortmannin (Wo), and SC79 (SC)-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF7
  cells, respectively. (d) Immunofluorescence staining for FOXA2 (green) in wortmannin
  (Wo) and SC79 (SC)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Scale bar = 50 Âµm. (e) Summary diagram
  for the signaling pathway.'
