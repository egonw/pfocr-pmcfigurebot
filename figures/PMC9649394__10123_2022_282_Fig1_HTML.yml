caption: 'Metabolic routes that could be expressed in P. putida for the production
  of GA (dashed arrows) with heterologous genes, all depending on the availability
  of intermediates from the Shikimate Pathway of P. putida KT2440 metabolism (full
  arrows). The metabolites and other molecules are: 3HB, 3-Hydroxybenzoate; 4HB, 4-Hydroxybenzoate;
  ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CHO, Chorismate; DHAP,
  3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; DHQ, 3-Dehydroquinate; DHS, 3-Dehydroshikimate;
  E4P, Eryhtrose-4-Phosphate; EPSP, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate; GA, Gallic
  acid; NADP, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH, Reduced form of
  NADP; O2, Oxygen; PCA, Protocatechuate; PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, Pyruvate;
  S3P, Shikimate-3-Phosphate; SHI, Shikimate. The enzymes are: AroA, 3-phosphoshikimate
  1-carboxyvinyltransferase; AroB, 3-dehydroquinate synthase; AroC, Chorismate synthase;
  AroD, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase; AroE, Shikimate dehydrogenase; AroF, AroG and
  AroH: Phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolases inhibited by tyrosine, phenylalanine
  and tryptophan, respectively; AroK/AroL, Shikimate kinases; AroZ, 3-dehydroshikimate
  dehydratase of Klebsiella baumannii; MobA, 3-hydroxybenzoate 4-monooxygenase of
  Comamonas testosterone; PobA and PobA*, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase of Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa and its mutated version (Tyr385Phe), respectively; QuiC, 3-dehydroshikimate
  dehydratase of Acinetobacter baumannii; UbiC, Chorismate pyruvate lyase of Escherichia
  coli; XanB2, Chorismatase of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestri'
