figure_title: Phosphorylation of PRKAR1A inhibits PKA activity
caption: (A) Co-immunoprecipitations of V5-tagged PRKAR1A, S77A/S83A PRKAR1A, or S77E/S83
  PRKAR1A and immunoblotting for PRKARCA in HEK293T cells stimulated with forskolin
  (10 μM, 30 min). n = 3 for each condition.(B) PKA activity in HEK293T cells stimulated
  with forskolin (10 μM, 30 min) and transfected with EV, wild-type PRKAR1A, S77A/S83A
  PRKAR1A mutant, or S77E/S83E PRKAR1A mutant as indicated.(C) HEK293T cells transfected
  with the indicated vectors and assessed for growth by Real Time Glo for 5 h after
  stimulation with forskolin (10 mM). A representative Real Time Glo assay analyzed
  in sextuplicate ±SEM is shown.(D) PKA activity in HEK293T cells stimulated with
  forskolin (10 μM, 30 min) and either overexpressing STK25 and/or the siRNA of PRKAR1A.(E)
  Model of STK25 downregulation of the PKA pathway through phosphorylation of PRKAR1A.For
  all graphs in this figure, n = 3 for each condition, data are presented as mean
  ± SD and analyzed in technical triplicates, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, and ****p <
  0.0001 by ANOVA with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons.See also .
