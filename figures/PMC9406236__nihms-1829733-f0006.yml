figure_title: FIBP KO inhibits cholesterol metabolism to enhance T cell antitumor
  efficacy
caption: a, Differential gene expression in T cells upon Fibp KO. Each dot represents
  one gene (n = 14,537). The log2FC and DESeq2 adjusted P values were computed by
  comparing RNA-seq counts between Fibp and Rosa26 control KOs. b, Pathway enrichments
  in Fibp KO expression profiles, from the IPA for up- and downregulated pathways.
  c, Expression values of genes in cholesterol metabolism. We only included genes
  with ∣log2FC∣ >1. All gene values were normalized by mean and s.d. across all profiles
  (n = 3 independent gRNAs). d, RT–qPCR validation of essential genes in cholesterol
  metabolism. Normalized expression levels were shown for control (Rosa26 for mouse
  and AAVS1 for human) and FIBP KOs, with mean from two independent gRNAs. e, Western
  blots of cholesterol metabolism regulators after Fibp KO. Protein levels of SREBF2
  (inactivated full-length and activated N-terminal NH2 fragments), LDLR and actin
  control were shown for Rosa26 control and Fibp KOs in mouse T cells (raw images
  are shown in ). f, Western blots of cholesterol metabolism regulators after Fibp
  overexpression. Protein levels are shown as in e for vector control and Fibp overexpression
  in mouse T cells (raw images are shown in ). g, In vivo flow analysis of cholesterol
  levels (Filipin III) in gene KO T cells. Representative histograms for gene KO T
  cells isolated from mouse tumors (left). Mean and s.d. are shown as error bars (n
  = 4 tumors per group) (right). Different KOs were compared using a one-sided Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test. h, In vitro cholesterol levels in T cells with overexpression of
  Fibp and control vectors as shown in g. The group difference was compared using
  a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test (n = 3 cell culture replicates per condition).
  i, A high-cholesterol environment inhibits T cell cytotoxicity. The killing efficacy
  on B16-mhgp100 cells was shown for T cells with Rosa26 control and Fibp KOs in a
  regular and high-cholesterol medium, with mean and s.e.m. shown as error bars (n
  = 6 cell culture replicates). P values were obtained using a two-sided Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test, comparing the high-cholesterol and control groups.
