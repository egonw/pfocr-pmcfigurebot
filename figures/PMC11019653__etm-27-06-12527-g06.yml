caption: 23-HBA inhibits the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells by causing
  cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. PPAR-γ may function as a tumor-suppressor gene
  in lung adenocarcinoma, and this finding may be related to the PPAR signaling pathway
  and mitochondrial ROS. PPAR signaling pathway-related genes were shown to be associated
  with the clinical prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. 23-HBA, 23-hydroxybetulinic
  acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PTGS2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide
  synthase 2; ACE, angiotensin I-converting enzyme; MDM2, mouse double minute 2; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
