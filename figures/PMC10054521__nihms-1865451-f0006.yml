figure_title: Biallelic ENTPD1 variants impair ATP hydrolysis and ENTPD1 expression
caption: (A) ATP metabolic pathway showing the role of ENTPD1 in hydrolysis of ATP
  to ADP and ADP to AMP. (B) Lymphoblasts were derived from family 16 with two affected
  siblings (P27 and P28) with homozygous ENTPD1:c.401T>G; p.(Met134Arg) variant. (C)
  Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR of ENTPD1 mRNA levels, using primers spanning
  both exons 1–2 and exons 9–10 showing significantly decreased ENTPD1 mRNA levels
  in lymphoblasts from individuals with homozygous ENTPD1:c.401T>G variant. (D) Western
  blot of ENTPD1 p.(Met134Arg) showing deceased protein levels in patient lymphoblasts.
  The stain-free gel serves as the loading control. (E) Measured ATPase and ADPase
  activity using normalized phosphate production after incubation with either ATP
  or ADP at a final concentration of 10 mM for 30 min. * p<0.05. (F) Flow cytometry
  of ENTPD1+ lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in blood samples
  from P13 and P14 with homozygous ENTPD1:c.185T>G; p.(Leu62*) variant compared to
  control and heterozygous parental samples. (G) Immunohistochemical staining for
  ENTPD1 performed on paraffin sections of sural nerve biopsy from P13 with variant
  ENTPD1:c.185T>G shows complete absence of endo- and epineural vascular staining
  compared to control sample.
