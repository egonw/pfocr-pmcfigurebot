caption: Identification of altered hepatic gene expression and functional pathways
  in response to AAI. (A) Volcano plots show DEGs and DEPs in scRNA-seq and proteomics
  datasets, AAI-4w vs Control and AAI-8w vs Control, respectively. (B) The heatmap
  plot indicates the relative expressions of DEGs and DEPs across two datasets. (C)
  Pathway and process enrichment analysis of DEGs and DEPs across two datasets in
  response to AAI.
