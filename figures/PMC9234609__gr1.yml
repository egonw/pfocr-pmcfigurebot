caption: miR-146b is lowly expressed in IBD mice models. The body weight (A) and DAI
  scores (B) of IBD mice during the DSS induction. The changes of colon were monitored
  and the length was measured. (C) colon length and the pathological changes. (D)
  HE staining and histological scores of colon tissues. (E and F) ELISA Kits were
  used for the determination of inflammation-related factors (E) and the expression
  of miR-146 in IBD mice (F). LPS-induced macrophages (G) was determined by q-PCR.
