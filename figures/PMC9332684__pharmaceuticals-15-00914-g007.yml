caption: 'Effect of montelukast on the liver in a pre-eclampsia model in rats. Photomicrographs
  of liver tissue of the control (A1,A2) and the Mont (B1,B2) groups showing the normal
  organization of the liver tissue. Notice the hepatocytes (arrows) with vesicular
  nuclei radiating from the central veins (CV) and separated by blood sinusoids (S).
  Notice the portal tract (PT). (C1,C2) The L-NAME group showing dilated, congested
  central veins (CV) and portal tracts (PT). Notice the more numerous apoptotic cells
  (arrows) and inflammatory cell infiltration (circle). (D1,D2) The Mont + L-NAME
  group showing more or less normal liver tissue. Notice the normal central veins
  (CV), portal tract (PT), and hepatocytes (arrows). Notice the less numerous apoptotic
  cells (arrows) H&E × 400. (E1–E3) The histopathological changes in renal tissue
  in all groups. The data are mean ± SEM (8 rats/group). (a) Significant (p < 0.05)
  difference from the control group. (b) Significant (p < 0.05) difference from the
  Mont group. (c) Significant (p < 0.05) difference from the L-NAME group. [Mont:
  montelukast; L-NAME: L-NG-Nitro arginine methyl ester.] H&E × 400, scale bare =
  50 µm.'
