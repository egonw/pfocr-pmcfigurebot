caption: A transcriptome analysis showing abnormalities of the RA signal pathway and
  lipid metabolism in WD-iPSC-derived hepatocytes. (A) Schematic illustration of RNA-seq.
  (B) Volcano plot showing the Log2 fold change as the X-axis and −log10 (FDR) as
  the Y-axis. All genes are plotted in red circles. The Cp gene is indicated by a
  blue arrow. Nonsignificant genes with FDR ≥ 0.05 are masked in gray. (C) A bar chart
  showing candidate metabolites using the HMDB metabolites program for downregulated
  genes. Metabolite names (HMDB metabolite ID) and values of −log10(P-value) are shown.
  (D) A bar chart showing candidate pathways using the NCATS BioPlanet program for
  upregulated genes. Pathway names and values of −log10(P-value) are shown. (E) A
  bar chart showing candidate disease types using the DisGeNET program for upregulated
  genes. Disease names and values of −log10(P-value) are shown. (F) The findings concerning
  cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism and bile acid metabolism in the GSEA
  are shown. The Y-axis represents the ES, and the X-axis shows the genes (vertical
  black lines) represented in gene sets. The green line connects points between the
  ES and genes. The ES is the maximum deviation from zero as calculated for each gene
  going down the ranked list and represents the degree of overrepresentation of a
  gene set at the top or bottom of the ranked gene list. The colored band at the bottom
  represents the degree of correlation of genes with the phenotype (red for positive
  and blue for negative correlation). The normalized enrichment score and false discovery
  ratio (FDR) are shown. (G) A pie chart showing overlapping downregulated genes in
  WD-specific hepatocytes and ATP7B KO mouse liver samples. The number of these genes,
  the percentage of overlapping genes and the overlapping gene name are shown. (H)
  A pie chart showing overlapping upregulated genes in WD-specific hepatocytes and
  ATP7B KO mouse liver samples. The number of these genes, the percentage of overlapping
  genes and the overlapping gene name are shown.
