caption: BMP-pathway is activated in SMAD4wt cells in response to MEK-inhibition.
  (A) Principal Component Analysis of mRNA expression of R4wt, R1R361H, and CRISPR-SMAD4R361H
  PDOs (clones A, B, and C). The first component on the x-axis contains 55% of the
  variance and classifies the samples into two major groups R1R361H/CRISPR-SMAD4R361H
  PDOs (treated with trametinib and untreated) and R4wt (treated with trametinib and
  untreated). (B) Five-set Venn diagram showing unique and overlapping genes from
  RNA sequencing of R4wt, R1R361H, and CRISPR-SMAD4R361H PDOs (clones A, B, and C).
  (C) Heatmap of differentially expressed total and (phospho-) proteins in R4wt, R1R361H,
  and CRISPR-SMAD4R361H PDOs (clones A, B, and C) after 24 h-treatment with DMSO (0.3%)
  and trametinib (0.03 µM) (all normalized over beta-actin, log2 fold change trametinib/DMSO.
  (D) Protein levels [%] involved in proliferation, MAPK pathway, mTOR pathway, and
  TGF-β/BMP pathway after 24 h-treatment with DMSO (0.3%) and trametinib (0.03 µM).
  Protein levels were normalized over beta-actin (treatment to DMSO control) in [%]
  or rather the ratio of phospho-protein level to the total protein level of replicates.
