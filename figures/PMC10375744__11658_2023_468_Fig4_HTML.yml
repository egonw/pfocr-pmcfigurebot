caption: OA-RD17 inhibited NF-κB activation to suppress inflammatory factors expression
  and activated MAPK to promote macrophage proliferation and migration. A-C RT-qPCR
  was performed to detect changes in mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α
  in macrophages treated with PBS, LPS, or LPS + OA-RD17. Relative expression was
  calculated using β-actin as an internal reference. D-F ELISA was conducted to determine
  IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression in macrophages treated with PBS, LPS, or LPS + OA-RD17.
  G OA-RD17 inhibited activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced by LPS in macrophages.
  H Quantification of phosphorylation of P65 and IκB. I Western blotting was performed
  to detect effects of OA-RD17 treatment for 24 h on MAPK signaling pathway in macrophages.
  J Quantification of key proteins of macrophage MAPK signaling pathway (phosphorylated
  proteins of P38, ERK, and JNK). All data are expressed as mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
