caption: 'Mitoribosomal defects in hepatocytes promote progression of DEN-induced
  liver cancer in mice. Liver tissues were harvested from control and LivKO mice at
  10 weeks of age and compared. (A) Immunoblotting and qRT-PCR data showing expression
  of CRIF1. (B) Representative western blot showing expression of OxPhos complex subunits,
  and (C) representative data from BN-PAGE analysis showing the assembled OxPhos complex.
  (D) Primary hepatocytes from 8-week-old control and LivKO mice were treated with
  or without gamitrinib (a mitochondrial matrix chaperone inhibitor) at 1 or 2 µM,
  followed by treatment with puromycin (1 µg/mL) for 30 min. Cells were harvested
  for protein extraction and analysis by western blotting using an anti-puromycin
  antibody to detect basal levels of global translation. (E) qRT-PCR analysis data
  showing expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress in liver tissues of
  tumor-free control and LivKO mice. Liver tissues were harvested from control and
  LivKO mice at 10 weeks of age and compared. (F) Results of pathway enrichment analysis
  comparing tumor-free control and LivKO mouse transcriptome data (colors correlate
  with normalized enrichment scores). (G) Comparison of reporter metabolite analysis
  between TCGA human HCC data and LivKO mouse tumor data. The statistical significance
  (-log 10 p values) of upregulated metabolites (two rightmost columns) and downregulated
  metabolites (two leftmost columns) is shown. (H) Visualization of upregulated (red
  texts) or downregulated (blue texts) glycolysis pathways, as determined by reporter
  metabolite analysis. Comparative analyses of DEN-treated control and LivKO mice
  at 40 weeks of age. (I) Representative pictures of liver weight and number of tumor
  nodules (J, K); and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
  (L, M). (N) Survival of DEN-treated control and LivKO mice. Data are expressed as
  the mean±SEM *p<0.05, **p<0.01 ((A, E, J–M): two-tailed t-test; (N): Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon
  test). BN-PAGE, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; TCGA, The Cancer Genome
  Atlas.'
