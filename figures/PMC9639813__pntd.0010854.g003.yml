figure_title: In vitro juvenile fluke display enhanced expression of genes required
  for cell signalling and in vivo juvenile fluke display enhanced expression of genes
  associated with the cell cycle
caption: (A) TopGO analysis of genes downregulated in vivo. (B) TopGo analysis of
  genes upregulated in vivo. mRNA GO term enrichment was analysed via topGO [] where
  FDR <0.05, method = weight01 and statistic = fisher. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of
  differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathways considered significantly differentially
  expressed as determined by statistical analysis using R (v.3.6.2), gage (v.2.36.0)
  and pathview (v.1.26.0) packages (Pâ‰¤0.05). Dotted line = 0 log2FC; dots to the right
  of dotted line represent pathways upregulated in vivo and dots to the left of the
  dotted line represent pathways downregulated in vivo. Colour = p value; size = gene
  count.
article_title: Transcriptomic analysis supports a role for the nervous system in regulating
  growth and development of Fasciola hepatica juveniles.
