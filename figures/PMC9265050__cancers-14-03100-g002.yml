caption: SND1 deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to MEK-ERK pathway inhibitors and
  Bcl-2 family inhibitor navitoclax. (Aâ€“D) CellTiter-Glo assay measuring the viability
  of the cells after indicated drug treatment (72 h) in control and stable, conditionally
  SND1 silenced cell lines (shRNA1). (E) Viability reduction after navitoclax treatment
  (72 h) in control and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated SND1 knock out cell line. (F) Western
  blot illustrating the absence of SND1 protein in SND1 knock out cell line. Two-tailed
  t-test was used for statistical analysis. Error bars indicate the standard error
  of the mean. N = 3, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001.

  and Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Navitoclax.
