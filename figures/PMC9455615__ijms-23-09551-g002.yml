caption: 'Characterization of AD and Pso-induced immune modifications concerning functional
  microbiome abundance and immune suppression mediated by SA-derived mechanisms. (a)
  Normalized enrichment scores (NES) of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-based
  gene sets stratified by C. avidum abundance in a Pso cohort. (b) The top four gene
  sets of the C. avidum high group in GSEA. ([NOM] p < 0.001; IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling,
  [NOM] p < 0.001; IFN-γ response, [NOM] p < 0.001; inflammatory response, [NOM] p
  < 0.001; TNF-α signaling via NF-κB). (c) Heatmap representing significant immune-related
  genes in the analysis of differentially expressed genes, comparing C. avidum high
  versus low groups. (d) Boxplots comparing macrophages (M1), resting mast cells,
  activated dendritic cells, and naïve CD4 T cells accordingly stratified by the abundance
  of C. avidum in Pso. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.001 comparing C. avidum
  high versus low groups. (e) Measurement of mRNA levels of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP
  relative to 18S rRNA. *** p < 0.001 compared to SA treatment group. ### p < 0.001
  between S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3 groups. (f) Measurement of mRNA level
  of IL-5 relative to 18S rRNA. *** p < 0.001; ns: not-significant compared to SA
  only treatment group. ### p < 0.001 between S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3 groups.
  (g) Measurement of mRNA level of IL-31 relative to 18S rRNA. *** p < 0.001 compared
  to control group. ### p < 0.001 between S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3. Statistical
  significance was calculated using Bonferroni tests. CIBERSORT algorithm was used
  for the TCGA data of the Pso cohort.'
