caption: 'Mechanisms that involved soluble factors in PCa. A) TGFβ: PPARδ, a TGFβ
  target gene, play a crucial role in regulating TGFβ paradox in cancer (from oncosuppressor
  to a tumor-promoting factor); PPARδ repression increases the inhibitory effect of
  TGFβ on tumor cell while PPARδ induction promotes TGFβ pro-tumoral functions; one
  of the crucial roles of TGFβ in orchestrating TME is mainly focused on immune cells
  on which works as immune suppressor molecule thus sustaining immune pro-tumoral
  functions; TGFβ is involved in Treg cell development and differentiation by inducing
  Foxp3 expression, a specific marker of Treg subset that controls and maintains immune
  tolerance and homeostasis. B) IL-6: IL-6 mediated activation of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT)/Janus kinase (JAK) axis has been demonstrated
  to support PCa cell proliferation, via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and
  2 (ERK1/2)-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway; IL-6 play a major role in increasing PCa aggressiveness
  by instructing EMT and homing of metastatic clones to the bone; IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
  signaling has been demonstrated to be crucial in favoring the neuroendocrine differentiation
  in PCa, by the canonical activation of STAT3 transcription factor. C) IL-10: IL-10
  is expressed by several cell types of the immune system, including dendritic cells
  (DCs), NK cells [–], eosinophils, neutrophils, and T cell subsets. IL-10 also induces
  expression of neuroendocrine markers and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in PCa
  cells. D) IL-23: IL-23 mediate expansion of Th17 cells and acts as a prognostic
  factor in patients with metastatic PCa; other mechanisms involving IL-23 as regulator
  of metastatic PCa, include the altered stimulation of the retinoic acid receptor-related
  orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) and STAT3 pathways; IL-23, produced by MDSCs, serve
  as promoter of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), by activating androgen
  receptor (AR) signaling and enhancing cell proliferation in a non-cell autonomous
  manner in PCa. prolif: proliferation; Th2: T helper 2; red arrows up and down: upregulation/increase
