caption: 'Protective effect of amifostine (AMI) on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary
  fibrosis in mice. (a) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissue sections (magnification × 100
  and × 200). (b) Masson staining of lung tissue sections (magnification × 100 and × 200).
  (c) Ashcroft score was used to determine the degree of pulmonary fibrosis. (d) Content
  of hydroxyproline in lung tissue. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001
  versus the control group. ###P < 0.001 and #P < 0.05 versus the model group. &&&P < 0.001
  and &P < 0.05 versus the AMI 200-mg/kg group.'
