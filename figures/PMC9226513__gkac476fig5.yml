caption: Improving 2′-fucosyllactose production by ordered control of competitive
  pathways and enhancing GTP supply. (A) A bifunctional thermosensitive genetic circuit
  was constructed using the temperature-responsive biosensors and CRISPRi based NOT
  gate. The 2′-fucosyllactose synthesis and GTP supply were upregulated by the temperature-responsive
  biosensor, and the competitive pathways were downregulated by the temperature -responsive
  repression cascade. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; M6P, mannose-6-
  phosphate; M1P, mannose-1-phosphate. (B) Effects of weakening PPP and glycolysis
  on 2′-fucosyllactose production. (C) Trends of cell growth, lactose, sucrose, extracellular
  and intracellular 2′-fucosyllactose concentration of the strain MT9 under ordered
  control from 30 to 34 to 37°C (changing the temperature to 34 and 37°C orderly after
  12- and 18-h growth). (D) The metabolic pathway of GTP synthesis in B. subtilis.
  (E) The cell growth and titer of GTP recycling-modified strains. In addition, trends
  of cell growth, sucrose, extracellular and intracellular 2′-fucosyllactose concentration
  of the strain MT17 are shown. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. of three replicates.
