figure_title: The inhibition of the pheromone response by unscheduled activation of
  Rheb requires Rsp5 and Art3
caption: '(A) Strains carrying the Rheb-activating alleles and loss-of-function mutations
  in rsp5 or art3 were able to form infective filaments. Crosses of control (FB1xFB2)
  and the indicated mutant strain combinations were spotted on minimal ammonium media
  charcoal plates and incubated for 24 h at 28°C. The white fuzzy colonies reflect
  the formation of b-dependent filaments. (B) Strains carrying the Rheb-activating
  alleles and loss-of-function mutations in rsp5 or art3 were able to form conjugation
  tubes and polarize Pra1-GFP. Fluorescent cell images from cultures of the indicated
  strains carrying an endogenous pra1-GFP allele incubated for 6 hours in minimal
  ammonium media in the presence of synthetic a2 pheromone (2.5 μg/ml). Cell images
  were obtained with the same time exposure. Insets showed magnification of selected
  cell tips. Bar: 15 μm. (See  for wide-field images). (C) Strains carrying the Rheb-activating
  alleles and loss-of-function mutations in art3 were able to infect plants. Representative
  leaves 14 days after infection with the indicated strains is shown. (D) Graph showing
  disease symptoms caused by crosses of wild-type (control) and the indicated mutant
  strains. The symptoms were scored 14 days after infection. Three independent experiments
  were carried out, and the average values are expressed as a percentage of the total
  number of infected plants (n: 30 plants in each experiment).'
