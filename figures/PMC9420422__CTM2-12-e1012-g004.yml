caption: 'Differential metabolites, correlation analysis, and enrichment analysis
  in fecal samples. (A) The orthogonal partial least‐squares discriminant analysis
  (OPLS‐DA) score plots between healthy control (HC) and NT groups in electrospray
  ionization positive mode (ESI+) and negative mode (ESI–). OPLS‐DA was used to reveal
  metabolic differentiation between groups. Cluster of dots with the same colour represents
  a similar metabolic profile, a clear separation between dots with different colours
  represents the difference of metabolic profiles between groups. Dark blue: HC group,
  green: NT group. (B) The OPLS‐DA score plots between NT and inhaled corticosteroid
  (ICS) groups in ESI+ mode and ESI– mode. Cluster of dots with the same color represents
  a similar metabolic profile, a clear separation between dots with different colours
  represents the difference of metabolic profiles between groups. Dark blue: NT group,
  green: ICS group. (C) Heatmap of some differential metabolites between NT and HC
  groups. (D) Heatmap of some differential metabolites between ICS group and NT groups.
  (E,F) Correlations between the most significant differential metabolites between
  NT and HC groups (E), and between ICS group and NT groups (F). Only these coefficients
  of p‐value < .05 were shown. (G,H) The pathway analysis by MetaboAnalyst on differential
  metabolites between NT group and HC group (G), between ICS group and NT group (H).
  Each circle is a representative of a biological pathway, and the size of the circle
  is enumerated based on the importance'
