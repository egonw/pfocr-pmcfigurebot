caption: Noncoding RNA regulating the exercise-induced regeneration. Exercise induces
  many noncoding RNAs in the regulation of physiological response. MiR-17-3p acts
  as the upstream of PTEN by inhibiting TIMP3, promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation
  and hypertrophy through Akt/mTOR pathway. Another two miRNAs, miR-26, and miR-16,
  also involve in the Akt/mTOR pathway. ADAR2 inhibits miR-34a, targeting SIRT1, CyclinD1,
  and Bcl2 and leading to cardiomyocyte proliferation. Exercise-induced miR-222 decreases
  the expression of HIPK1, promoting cardiomyogenesis. Furthermore, miR-1 and miR-133
  promote myogenesis via inhibiting HDAC4 and SRF, respectively. MiR-122-5p can promote
  angiogenesis through AGPAT1 pathway. Additionally, miR-27a-5p upregulates the expression
  of SOST to achieve osteogenesis. Of note, miR-21 and miR-199a-3p are also regulated
  by exercise, which is involved in PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. While miR-135a-5p
  promotes neurogenesis via inhibiting IP3 pathway. Exercise also modulates the effect
  of lncRNA on tissue regeneration. LncRNA CYTOR can achieve myogenesis through sequestering
  Tead1. LncExACT1 induces pathological myocardial hypertrophy, which is downregulated
  by exercise. While lncRNA CPhar promotes cardiomyogenesis through decreasing ATF7
  by sequestering C/EBPÎ². Created with BioRender
