caption: FLI1 represses NLRP3 transcription. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of downstream
  targets of FLI1. (B) Protein-protein interactions (PPI) enrichment analysis of downstream
  targets of FLI1. (C) FLI1 has a possible binding relation with the NLRP3 promoter
  region. (D, E) Expression of NLRP3 in the liver of mice with cirrhosis by RT-qPCR
  (D) and Western blot (E) (original, full-length gel and blot images can be found
  in the ). (F, G) Expression of FLI1 and NLRP3 in LPS-treated mouse hepatocytes assessed
  by RT-qPCR (F) and Western blot (G) (original, full-length gel and blot images can
  be found in the ). (H, I) Effects of transfection with oe-FLI1 on FLI1 and NLRP3
  expression in LPS-treated hepatocytes by RT-qPCR (H) and Western blot (I) (original,
  full-length gel and blot images can be found in the ). (J) Binding site of FLI1
  on the NLRP3 promoter. (K) The effect of FLI1 on NLRP3 transcription evaluated using
  the luciferase reporter assay. (L) The binding relation between FLI1 and NLRP3 promoter
  measured using ChIP-qPCR. Data are displayed as the mean Â± SD of three independent
  experiments (n = 6) and analyzed by unpaired t test or one-way/two-way ANOVA. *P
