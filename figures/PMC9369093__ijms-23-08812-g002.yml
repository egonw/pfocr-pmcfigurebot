caption: Effect of compounds obtained from E. globulus leaves in the amyloidogenic
  pathway and in the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in AD. The amyloidogenic pathway
  is initiated with the enzymatic breakdown of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
  β-secretase enzyme followed by catalytic cleavage of APP by γ-secretase to originate
  non-soluble protein or Aβ. Aβ oligomerization and accumulation leads to synaptic
  dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
