caption: HMGB-1 RAGE signaling induced by oHSV therapy activates endothelial cells(A)
  Total RNA sequencing of U87ΔEGFR cells analyzed for top genes involved in inflammatory
  pathways. KEGG pathway analysis showing the top 10 upregulated pathways involved
  in inflammatory regulation enriched in oHSV-infected U87ΔEGFR cells cultured with
  microglial cells.(B) EC leakiness was evaluated by measuring the ability of Evan’s
  Blue albumin (EBA) to permeate a confluent EC monolayer as shown on the top. Data
  shown are mean EBA ± SD.(C) PBMC adhesion to EC monolayers was assessed as shown
  on the top. Data shown are mean PBMC ±SD bound to ECs stimulated with CM ± oHSV ±
  αHMGB1.(D) Quantification of EC migration after ECs were stimulated by glioma cells ±
  oHSV ± anti-RAGE (2 μg/mL) or esRAGE (200 ng/mL). Data shown are the mean numbers
  of ECs that migrated through the Transwell membrane ± SD. ∗p < 0.05.(E) Kaplan-Meier
  survival curve are plotted using patients with IDH wild-type recurrent glioma with
  overall survival information from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Tumors
  are stratified into two groups with the cutoff set as the median of AGER gene expression.
  Log rank and Wilcoxon p values are labeled on top of each survival curve. ∗p < 0.05.
  Data shown are RFUs ± SD, normalized to media control.
