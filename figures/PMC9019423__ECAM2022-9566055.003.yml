caption: DeltaN p63 could regulate the EMT pathway. (a) KEGG analyzing the downstream
  regulatory pathways of deltaN p63. (b) GSEA analyzing the downstream regulatory
  pathways of deltaN p63. (c) RT-PCR detection of the EMT pathway mRNA level after
  knockdown or increased deltaN p63 expression. (d) WB detection of the EMT pathway
  mRNA level after knockdown or increased deltaN p63 expression.
