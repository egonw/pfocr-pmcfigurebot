caption: Functional enrichment analysis for CR-related gene signature. (A) Enriched
  biological processes included cytoplasmic translation, oxidative phosphorylation,
  mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly. (B) Enriched cell components included
  mitochondrial protein-containing complex, ribosome, inner mitochondrial membrane
  protein complex. (C) Enriched molecular functions included structural constituent
  of ribosome, oxidoreduction-driven active transmembrane transporter activity and
  electron transfer activity. (D) Enriched KEGG pathways included ribosome, diabetic
  cardiomyopathy, chemical carcinogenesis (E, F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  showed the top 10 KEGG signaling pathway including AMPK signaling pathway, dopaminergic
  synapse, central carbon metabolism in cancer, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and others.
