caption: ZmGLP1 increases resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Arabidopsis. (A)
  Phenotypes of different groups before and after being treated with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  at 3 d. (B) The disease indexes of different groups at 3 d. (C) The disease spot
  diameter of the Arabidopsis leaves in different groups treated with Sclerotinia
  sclerotiorum at 12, 24, and 36 h. (D) H2O2 content in Arabidopsis leaves of different
  groups at 3 d. (E) The expression levels of target plant genes of the salicylic
  acid, jasmonic acid, or ethephon pathway at 6 h. AtActin2 and AtTUB4 were used as
  reference genes for normalization. (F) Trypan blue staining and DAB staining of
  different groups of leaves at 3 d. Different letters in subfigures (B–E) indicated
  significant difference between different samples by Duncan’s post-hoc test. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD based on three biological replicates.
