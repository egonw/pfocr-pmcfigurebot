caption: 'RNA sequencing was used to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs in
  DSS-induced colitis mouse colon tissue. (a) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed
  lncRNAs between the colon tissues of the control, DSS+PBS, and DSS+IL-22 groups
  of mice. Red color is used to show the upregulated genes, and green color is used
  to show the downregulated genes. (b) KEGG pathway analysis showed the possible signaling
  pathway that may be involved in the differentially expressed lncRNA regulatory network.
  (c) qRT-PCR was performed to validate the identity of the top 5 lncRNAs, which were
  most differentially expressed in colon tissues between all groups of mice. lncRNA
  NONMMUG038140 (lncRNA-UCL) was selected as the target and to be used in further
  studies. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM. ###P < 0.001; ##P < 0.01; #P < 0.05 using
  Student''s t-test.'
