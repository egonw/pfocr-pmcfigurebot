figure_title: Multiple strategies for inhibiting Hh signal transduction pathway
caption: Hh signal transduction can be blocked at multiple steps including Hh inhibitors
  that either inhibit the activity of Hh acyltransferase (Hhat) or directly bind and
  inhibit Hh, Smo inhibitors, Gli inhibitors as well as pathway modulators that inhibit
  Gli by regulating its kinases or binding partners. See text for details.
