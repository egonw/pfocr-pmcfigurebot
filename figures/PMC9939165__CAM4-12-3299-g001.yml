caption: MARCKSL1 regulated cell mobility and migration as shown by RNA‐seq analysis.
  (A) A volcano plot of the distribution of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  was constructed, mapping the 351 upregulated genes in red dots and the 449 downregulated
  genes in green dots after MARCKSL1 knockdown. (B) The heatmap of 800 DEGs is shown.
  Red denotes upregulation, and blue represents downregulation. (C) KEGG pathway analysis
  among the 800 DEGs was performed via DAVID. The top 15 enriched pathways are shown.
  (D and E) The mRNA (D) and protein (E) expression levels of representative genes
  associated with the MAPK signaling pathway were confirmed by qPCR and western blot
  analysis in KYSE140 cells. The representative data are presented as the mean ± SEM
  from independent triplicate experiments. Ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001. (F) Western blotting showed marked decreases in the phosphorylation
  of MEK, ERK and JNK in KYSE140 cells after MARCKSL1 knockdown . (G) Gene Ontology
  (GO) analysis based on 800 DEGs was performed by DAVID. The top 10 enriched pathways
  are shown, including cell differentiation, cell migration, proliferation and motility.
  (H) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment profiles from RNA‐sequencing
  reveal that MARCKSL1 is significantly associated with epithelial‐mesenchymal transition
  and apical junction.
