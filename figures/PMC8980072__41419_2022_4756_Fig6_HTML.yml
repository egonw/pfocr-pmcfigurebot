figure_title: PARD6A affects EMT of ovarian cancer cells through SNAIL1 signaling
  pathways
caption: A, B Overexpression of SNAIL1 reversed the effects of PARD6A silencing on
  EMT in SKOV3 cells. SKOV3 cells were first transfected with siPARD6As for 24 h,
  and then transfected with SNAIL1 overexpression plasmids. Then the cells were incubated
  for 6 h, and replaced with fresh medium and incubated for 24 h before experiments.
  Representative images (A) and statistical analysis (B) of transwell migration and
  invasion assays were shown here. Scale bar = 200 µm. C SNAIL1 overexpression reversed
  the change of protein levels of VIMENTIN and E-cadherin by PARD6A silencing in SKOV3
  cells. Total protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated
  antibodies, except that nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
  SNAIL1 or Histone H3 antibodies. D, E Silencing of SNAIL1 reversed the effects of
  PARD6A overexpression on EMT in HO8910 cells. HO8910 cells were first infected with
  lentivirus to overexpress PARD6A, and then treated with siSNAIL1s to silence SNAIL1.
  Representative images (D) and statistical analysis (E) of transwell migration and
  invasion assays were shown here. Scale bar = 200 µm. F Silencing of SNAIL1 reversed
  the change of protein levels of VIMENTIN and E-cadherin by PARD6A overexpression
  in HO8910 cells. Total protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
  the indicated antibodies, except that nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoblot
  analysis with SNAIL1 or Histone H3 antibodies. Data shown in B and E are the mean
  values (±SD) from three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences
  with P < 0.05 were considered significant (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
