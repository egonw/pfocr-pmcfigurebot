caption: 'Activation of IL‐17 signalling pathway inhibits the mechanism improvement
  of human breast milk (HBM)‐Exo. (A) IL‐17 and FADD protein expression in control,
  hyperoxia and hyperoxia with HBM‐Exo treatment group, as well as hyperoxia with
  HBM‐Exo treatment plus IL‐17 cytokines group by Western blot. (B) Protein expression
  of the apoptotic‐related C‐Caspase3 and C‐Caspase9 in control, hyperoxia, hyperoxia
  with HBM‐Exo treatment group, as well as hyperoxia with HBM‐Exo treatment plus IL‐17
  cytokines group by western blot. Data represent results from 3 individual studies.
  The pictures shown are representative. Unpaired t‐test, */#p < 0.05,**/##p < 0.01,
  ***/###p < 0.001. Con: control, Exo: HBM‐Exo, Hyp: Hyperoxia, C‐Caspas: cleaved‐caspase.
  * VS Con, # VS BPD. The concentration of HBM‐Exo: 15.4μg/ml protein'
