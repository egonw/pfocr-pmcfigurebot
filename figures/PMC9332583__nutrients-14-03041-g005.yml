caption: Butyrate increases TLR5 transcriptional expression in HT29 cells. RTâ€“qPCR
  shows TLR5 mRNA expression in HT29 cells treated with a physiological concentration
  of butyrate (1 to 8 mM) for 24 h (A) or with 4 mM butyrate for a specific duration
  (B). (C) Immunofluorescence images of TLR5 in the control and butyrate groups; the
  butyrate treatment conditions were 4 mM for 24 h. (D) The change in TLR5 mRNA expression
  from adding transcription inhibitors or translation inhibitors in the control and
  butyrate groups. (E) Representative Western blot analysis showing TLR5 expression
  after the addition of transcription inhibitors or translation inhibitors to the
  control and butyrate groups. (F) Quantitative analysis of Western blot analysis.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
