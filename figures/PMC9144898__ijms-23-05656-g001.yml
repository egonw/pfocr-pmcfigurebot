caption: Treatment with the thalidomide overcame the suppression of lung functions
  in response to silica exposure. (A) Schematic of thalidomide administration in therapeutic
  administration model of silicosis mice. There are four groups (Control, SiO2, SiO2
  + thalidomide 50, SiO2 + thalidomide 100) in the following experiments (8 mice per
  group). (B–F) Lung functions of mice exposed to silica and treated with thalidomide.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. n = 5 per group.
