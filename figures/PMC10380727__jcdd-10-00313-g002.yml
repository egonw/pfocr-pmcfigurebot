caption: Signaling axes in cardiac fibrosis. Multiple stimuli have been demonstrated
  to orchestrate the activation of cardiac fibroblasts triggering the transcription
  of pro-fibrotic genes and fibrotic response. (1) Cytokines as IL1, IL2, TNFα though
  the activation of JAK1/STAT pathway; (2) Neurohumoral signaling via AngII binding
  to its membrane AT1R initiating pro-fibrotic gene transcription through MAPKK/p38
  signaling; Ischemia-induced canonical and noncanonical TGFβ/TGFβR signaling via
  Smad2/3 or TAK1/p38; injury-induced Dlk1 attenuation of TGFβ/TGFβR2 signaling via
  activation of miR-370. Canonical WNT/β-catenic initiating gene transcription through
  activation of TCF/LEF signaling. Mechanical stretch, through stretch-sensitive ion
  channels and TRPC6 activate Ca2+-dependent calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway to
  induce myofibroblast gene transcription.
