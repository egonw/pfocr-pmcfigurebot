caption: LRRK2 G2019S mutation-induced Drosophila DA neurodegeneration can be abrogated
  by α-MT, a TH inhibitor. Yellow white control and WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2 TG Drosophila
  are crossed with ddc-GAL4 line and cultured in the presence or absence of 15 µM
  α-MT for 30 days. A α-MT treatment can improve locomotor deficits of climbing ability
  of TG mutant G2019S LRRK2 Drosophila. *P < 0.01, compared with the percentage of
  Drosophila on top of control group in the absence of α-MT. B α-MT treatment can
  prevent mutant G2019S LRRK2-induced DA content decrease in Drosophila heads. *,
  at least P < 0.05, compared with DA content in Drosophila heads of control group
  in the absence ofα-MT. C α-MT treatment can protect against DA neurodegeneration
  in mutant G2019S LRRK2 Drosophila heads. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the
  number of TH-positive neurons in control Drosophila heads. D Representative confocal
  image of TH neurons in Drosophila heads of control and LRRK2 transgenic Drosophila
  cultured for 60 days. E Representative Western blot gels of DA-conjugated proteins
  and DNP-positive proteins in control and LRRK2 TG Drosophila heads after culture
  for 3 days or 30 days
