figure_title: Functional genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines
caption: '(A) Inferred pathway and (B) TF activities of SARS-CoV-2 infected samples
  from lung epithelial cell lines (Calu-3 and A549). Activities were calculated from
  differential expression signatures (infectedâ€”control) using PROGENy and DoRothEA
  tools for pathway and TF activities, respectively. Only TFs with high absolute level
  of activity changes (absolute normalized enrichment score > 4) are shown. (C) Causal
  signalling network in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells (GSE147507) identified by
  CARNIVAL. RIG-I like receptors (DDX58 and IFIH1) as perturbation targets and DoRothEA
  inferred TF activities were used as the input of the CARNIVAL pipeline. Color code
  represents inferred activity of protein nodes (blue: inhibited, red: activated).'
