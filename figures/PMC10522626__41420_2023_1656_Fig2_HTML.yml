figure_title: Metabolomics confirm increased matrix stiffness drive MDFs arginine
  and proline metabolism
caption: A Principal component analysis showed separation of 50 kPa-MDFs (n = 6) vs
  2 kPa-MDFs (n = 8). B Volcano map between 50 kPa-MDFs and 2 kPa-MDFs. C Metabolites
  enrichments for significantly upregulated pathways from 50 kPa-MDFs vs 2 kPa-MDFs.
  D Illustration schematic of arginine and proline metabolism pathway. E Measurement
  of L-Arginine, L-Ornithine and L-Proline in 2 kPa-MDFs and 50 kPa-MDFs (n = 5).
  F Western blot assay for key metabolic enzymes Arg1, OAT, PYCR1 and PRODH in 2 kPa-MDFs/50 kPa-MDFs
  and quantitative analysis (n = 3). G Measurement of key metabolic enzymes activity
  Arg1, OAT, PYCR1 and PRODH in 2 kPa-MDFs/50 kPa-MDFs and quantitative analysis (n = 5).
  The results are expressed as the means with SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005,
  ****P < 0.001.
