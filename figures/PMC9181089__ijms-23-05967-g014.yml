caption: 'Representative photomicrographs of NCX1 immuno-stained sections from the
  left ventricle of the myocardium in the different experimental groups: (a) Group
  I (control group) showed strong immuno-expression of NCX1 in the myocardium; (b)
  Group IIa (DOX/Trz group) showed minimal immuno-expression of NCX1 in the myocardium;
  (c) Group IIb (recovery group) showed near-minimal immuno-expression of NCX1 in
  the myocardium; (d) Group III (prophylactic group) showed strong immuno-expression
  of NCX1 in the myocardium; (e) Group IV (curative group) showed moderate immuno-expression
  of NCX1 in the myocardium; and (f) Histogram representing the mean area percentage
  of NCX1 immuno-reaction in all experimental groups. **, significant compared to
  Group I at p ˂ 0.01; ##, significant compared to Group II at p ˂ 0.01; $, significant
  compared to Group III at p ˂ 0.05; n = 6.'
