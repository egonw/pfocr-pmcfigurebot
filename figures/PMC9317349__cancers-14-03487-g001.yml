caption: Anticancer mechanisms of dihydromyricetin. DHM regulates MDM2-mediated p53
  pathway to trigger apoptosis in exogenous death receptor pathway and inhibits TGF-β-Smad3
  signaling, disturbs ROS balance, and promotes apoptosis in endogenous mitochondrial
  and endoplasmic reticulum pathways. DHM also induces autophagy through the PDGFR/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, DHM inhibits miR-21/PTEN/Akt
  pathway, miR-455/ZEB1/PI3K pathway, TNF-α/P38/MMP pathway, and ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway,
  as well as ERK/SP-1/uPA pathway, thereby suppressing cancer cell metastasis and
  proliferation. Furthermore, DHM can also activate AMPK α/GSK-3β/P21 pathway, leading
  to cell cycle arrest.
