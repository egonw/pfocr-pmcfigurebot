caption: miR-205-5p translationally represses PTEN by targeting specific sequences
  in the 3′UTR of PTEN. (A) miR-205-5p and PTEN have targeted binding sites. (B) RT-qPCR
  detected the expression level of PTEN mRNA in cells. (C) Dual-luciferase assay verified
  the targeted binding of miR-205-5p and PTEN. (D) PTEN mRNA and protein expression
  levels were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD of three experiments; *P<0.05. miR, microRNA; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; NC, negative control; wt, wild type; mut, mutant.
article_title: Icariin inhibits the malignant progression of lung cancer by affecting
  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
