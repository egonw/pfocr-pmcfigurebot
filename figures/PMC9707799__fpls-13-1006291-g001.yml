caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between A- and B-phase of F hirta
  bracts. (A) KEGG classification pathway of up-regulated genes. (B) KEGG pathway
  of down-regulated genes. (C) GO classification of up-regulated genes. (D) Heatmaps
  of expression profiles of differentially expressed transcription factors genes according
  to FPKM. The data inside the box represents FPKM. FhirtaA and FhirtaB represent
  A phase and B phase of F hirta bracts, respectively.
