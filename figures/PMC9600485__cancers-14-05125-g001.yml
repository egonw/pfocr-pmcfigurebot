caption: The TRAIL-induced cell death pathway and its regulation. Interaction of TRAIL
  with DR4 and DR5 leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein, FADD, which then
  binds pro-caspase-8 and/or -10 leading to their activation. Activated caspase-8/-10
  are released from the DISC into the cytoplasm, where they activate the downstream,
  effector caspases, which by cleaving vital proteins commit the cell to die. Caspase-8
  can also cleave the BH3-only protein, Bid thus activating it. Truncated Bid (tBid)
  then binds and activates Bax and Bak, leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
  and release of apoptotic factors such as Cyt c and Smac into the cytosol. Cyt c
  binds to APAF-1 thus initiating its oligomerization and recruitment of pro-caspase-9.
  The formed protein complex is called the apoptosome, serving as an activation platform
  for pro-caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and activates the effector caspases,
  caspase-3/-6/-7, thus amplifying the DR-initiated apoptotic signal. Apoptosis signaling
  is kept under control at all stages of the process. First, decoy receptors (DcR1,
  DcR2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) can sequester TRAIL thus preventing DR4/5 activation.
  cFLIP can interact and inhibit pro-caspase-8 in the DISC. At the mitochondrion,
  antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, e.g., Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL inhibit Smac and Cyt
  c release. XIAP can inhibit caspase-3/-7/-9 activation; while Smac can block XIAP,
  thus allowing the apoptotic program to progress. TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand; DR, death receptor; OPG, osteoprotegerin; DcR, decoy
  receptor; DD, death domain, FADD, Fas-associated death domain; Active/Pro-C, pro-caspase;
  DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; cFLIP, Cellular FLICE inhibitory protein;
  Cyt c, cytochrome c; APAF-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; Smac, XIAP,
  X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; Bak, BCL-2 antagonist/killer; Bax, Bcl-2
  associated X protein. Figure was generated with BioRender.
