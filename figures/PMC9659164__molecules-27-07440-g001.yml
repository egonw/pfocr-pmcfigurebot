caption: 'HPLC chromatogram of PD sample containing seven peaks (A). Peak #1 was at
  retention time (RT) 1.50 with a specific UV spectrum (位max 196 nm) (B), and peak
  #6 was at RT 5.99 min with a particular UV spectrum (位max 196 nm) (C), which were
  identified as L-anserine and L-carnosine when compared to the standard compounds.
  The reference standard L-anserine was eluted at RT 1.38 min (D) with UV spectrum
  (位max 204 nm) (F). Meanwhile, L-carnosine was eluted at RT 5.77 min (E) with UV
  spectrum (位max 199 nm) (G). The linear calibration curves of L-anserine plotted
  between peak areas versus corresponding concentrations and the polynomial calibration
  curve of L-carnosine plotted between peak heights versus corresponding concentrations
  (H) were established from the chromatograms of various concentrations ((D,E), respectively).'
