caption: Validation of the results obtained by the dry and wet analyses. (A) Epitope
  structures recognized by the anti-sialoglycoconjugates antibody used in this study.
  Combinations of the antibody with its epitope structure (red square) are indicated
  on the pathway maps for the complex N-glycan, mucin, and ganglioside. (B) Expression
  patterns of oligo/polySia structures predicted by (1) the Glycomaple method and
  (2) our method (). (C) Expression patterns of oligo/polySia structures observed
  by the flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting. For B and C, dark color, high
  expression; light color, low expression; white, no expression.
