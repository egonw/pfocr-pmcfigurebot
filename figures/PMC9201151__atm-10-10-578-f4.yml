caption: Gene expression of various metabolic pathways in the liver tissue of septic
  rats. (A-C) Amino acid metabolic pathway. (D-F) Fatty acid metabolic pathway. (H)
  PPAR signaling pathway. (I) CYP450 enzyme metabolic pathway. Dark colors indicate
  gene down-regulation, while light colors indicate gene up-regulation. PPAR, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor Î±.
