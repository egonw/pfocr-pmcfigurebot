figure_title: Phosphoproteomics analysis of brains from WT mice and mice harboring
  the PKCα M489V mutation (red) on a B6;SJL background with the APP transgene carrying
  the Swedish mutation (APPswe)
caption: 'a Experimental design. Brains from WT (blue) or homozygous (red) mice with
  or without the APPswe transgene at 4.5 and 6 months of age were subjected to phosphoproteomics
  analysis. 7574 proteins and 28,084 phosphopeptides were quantified in the standard
  proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses, respectively. b Graphs showing the abundance
  of APP (left) and PKCα (right) detected in the proteomic analysis across all samples.
  Graphs depicts the mean ± SD (p values obtained using a two-tailed Student’s t test,
  n = 3 biologically independent samples). c Left. Immunoblot of brain lysates obtained
  from WT non tg-AD mice (lanes 1–5, dark blue) and tg-AD mice (lanes 6–10, light
  blue). Right. Relative phosphorylation represents the quantification of PKC substrates
  phosphor-signal normalized to vinculin. Normalized data from the depicted western
  blot were plotted as average normalized intensity ± SEM (p = 0.0438, using a two-tailed
  Student’s t test). d Left: graph showing the distribution of phosphopeptides from
  C9 Graph depicts the median± interquartile range (values of p < 0.05 using a two-tailed
  Student’s t test, n = 3 biological independent samples). Right. GO enrichment analysis
  of C9 peptides using DAVID. e STRING analysis of proteins whose phosphopeptides
  were present in C9. Red represents proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway, green
  in the MAPK signaling pathway and blue represents proteins involved in neuron projection.
  f Left. Immunoblot of pERK1/2 (T202/Y204 for ERK1 and T185/Y187 for ERK2) and total
  ERK1/2 in brain lysates obtained from WT non-tg-AD (WT), M489V non tg-AD (M489V),
  WT tg-AD and M489V tg-AD mice at 6 months. Right. ERK1 (top) or ERK2 (bottom) phosphorylation
  reflects the normalized phospho-signal relative to total ERK. Data represent the
  average normalized intensity ± SEM (ANOVA was used for statistical analysis, followed
  by post hoc two-tailed Student’s t test). g Quantification of ERK phosphopeptides
  detected by phosphoproteomics in 6-month-old samples (mean ± SD). Source data and
  uncropped blots for c and f are in the Source Data file.'
