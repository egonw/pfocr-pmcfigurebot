caption: CBFN volumes and cholinergic pathway hyperintensities are only weakly correlated.
  Scatter plots with linear regression lines and Spearman r values showing the relationship
  between volumes of the left and right cholinergic cell groups (Ch1-3 and Ch4; corrected
  for total intracranial volume) and cholinergic pathway hyperintensities (CHIPS scores)
  in AD and controls.
