caption: Transcriptome alterations in hippocampus of MIAO orally gavaged with Parabacteroides
  goldsteinii MTS01. Dot plots of the significantly upregulated (normalized enrichment
  score [NES] > 1 and false-discovery rate [FDR] q value < 0.25) and downregulated
  ([NES] < −1 and FDR q value < 0.25) gene sets from gene set enrichment analysis
  of the MIAO + Pg group compared to the MIAO group (top 20 gene sets in GO_BP, GO_MF
  and GO_CC) are presented in (A,B), respectively. Gene sets with similar functions
  were labeled in color, and the functions were also added. Eight genes contributing
  to the leading-edge subset within the gene sets (ribosome, oxidoreductase, NADH
  dehydrogenase, antioxidant, regulation of transmission of nerve impulse, and glutamate
  receptor signaling pathway) as validated by quantitative RT-PCR are presented in
  (C–J). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01
  (unpaired Student’s t-test). MIAO + Pg, MIAO treated with P. goldsteinii MTS01.
