caption: 'Bta-miR-199a-3p negatively regulates the mRNA and protein expression of
  CD2AP in the MAC-T cells. (A) Effect of overexpression or inhibition of bta-miR-199a-3p
  on CD2AP mRNA expression. (B,C) Effect of overexpression or inhibition of bta-miR-199a-3p
  on CD2AP protein expression: (B) is the result of Western blot, and (C) is the image
  analysis result of (B) (with β-actin as the standardized correction). * refers to
  p < 0.05, ** refers to p < 0.01.'
