caption: Determination of PTEN-siR/overexpression and KLF4-siR/overexpression in NSCLC
  cells at different times. (a) The expression levels of PTEN and KLF4 in A549 cells
  treated by PTEN-siR/overexpression and KLF4-siR/overexpression at different times
  compared to controls treated by PBS, respectively. (b) The expression levels of
  PTEN and KLF4 in PC9 cells treated by PTEN-siR/overexpression and KLF4-siR/overexpression
  at different times compared to controls treated by PBS, respectively. Î²-Actin was
  used as an internal control. All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate.
