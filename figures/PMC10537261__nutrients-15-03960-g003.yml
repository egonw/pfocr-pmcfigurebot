caption: A schematic diagram demonstrating ghrelin’s effect on two major brain regions,
  namely, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
  and its relationship with reward response, obesity, hedonic eating, anxiety, and
  depression. Plasma ghrelin levels rise in response to psychological stress, activating
  the hedonic signaling pathway and promoting the consumption of food. This stress-related
  hyperphagia and food reward behavior lead to an increase in body weight, which has
  been associated with major depressive disorder and anxiety. NPY/AgRP neurons—neuropeptide
  Y/agouti-related peptide neurons. GHSR-1a—growth hormone secretagogue receptor;
  +—stimulating; −—inhibiting.
