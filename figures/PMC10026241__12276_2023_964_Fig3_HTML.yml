figure_title: Corticosteroid treatment suppresses the type-I IFN response in classical
  monocytes (CMs) and intermediate monocytes (IMs)
caption: a tSNE plot of pseudobulk gene expression values for CMs/IMs in each sample.
  Colors represent individual patients. Arrows indicate the progression of time. Six
  patients with a pretreatment sample are labeled with text. b HALLMARK pathway enrichment
  analysis of genes downregulated by corticosteroid treatment. Padj, adjusted P value.
  c–f Expression of genes related to key signaling pathways. Left, dot plots depicting
  the percentage of cells in which the gene was detected (“Percent Expressed”) and
  average expression level of the gene (scaled data) in each cluster (blue, “Average
  Expression”). Right, ridge plots depicting the expression of genes changed between
  pre- and post-corticosteroid treatment.
