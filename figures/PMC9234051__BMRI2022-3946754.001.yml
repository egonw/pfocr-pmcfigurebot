caption: KEGG analysis and qPCR showed that T cell receptor signaling pathway and
  CD112R and CD96 are associated with AS. (a) Top 20 significantly enriched pathways
  of 642 DEGs. (b) CD112R and CD96 were significantly downregulated in AS patients
  through bioinformatics analysis. (c) qPCR validation of the expression of CD112R
  and CD96 between patients with AS and the healthy controls (∗∗P < 0.01,  ∗∗∗P <
  0.001).
