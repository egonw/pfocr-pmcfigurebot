caption: Dynamics of bacterial functional profiles in different treatments analyzed
  by PICRUSt (n = 3). (A) Level 1 metabolic pathway. (B) Level 2 KEGG ortholog functional
  predictions of the relative abundances with significant differences in the top 20
  metabolic functions. (C) Level 3 KEGG ortholog functional predictions of the relative
  abundances of the top 30 metabolic functions. FM, fresh materials; CON, Samples
  without inoculants; FM, fresh material; T1, native grass inoculated with Lactobacillus
  plantarum; T2, native grass inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus
  buchneri; T3, native grass inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus
  buchneri, and Pediococcus pentosaceus.de. * Indicates significant at p < 0.05, **
  indicates significant at p < 0.01 and *** indicates significant at p < 0.001.
