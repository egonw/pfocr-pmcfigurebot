caption: In vivo drug toxicity test. Mice were randomly assigned to the control (250 μL
  of PBS, oral) group or SZKJT (5.2 g/kg, oral) group. SZKJT was given 3 times a week
  for 3 weeks. The body weights of the mice were recorded once per week. Blood samples
  were obtained from the mice before and after SZKJT treatment. (A) Curves showing
  the body weights of the control (250 μL of PBS, oral, N = 6) group and SZKJT (5.2 g/kg,
  oral, N = 6) group are provided. The levels of ASL, ALT, glucose (GLU) (B), creatinine,
  and albumin (C) and complete blood counts and differential counts (D) of the mice
