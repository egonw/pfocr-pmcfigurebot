caption: Sequence alignment of THC2′GT, CHS, and CHI from P. delavayi var. lutea and
  other species. (a) Amino acid sequences’ homologous analysis of the THC2′GT gene
  and other species’ related genes. The red box shows the glycosyltransferase domains—PSPG-box.
  (b) Amino acid sequences’ homologous analysis of the CHS gene and other species’
  related genes. The green box indicates the highly conserved domains of CHS. (c)
  Amino acid sequences’ homologous analysis of the CHI gene and other species’ related
  genes. The yellow box indicates the conserved active sites of CHI.
