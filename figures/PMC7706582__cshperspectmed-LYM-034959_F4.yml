caption: 'Frequent mutations during B-cell development. In the bone marrow, rearrangements
  of the immunoglobulin genes of B-cell precursors to form a B-cell receptor (BCR)
  generate DNA breaks that are occasionally resolved aberrantly, leading to chromosomal
  translocations (). These are the most common genetic alterations in B-precursor
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (). The most frequent mature B-cell neoplasms
  that have their origin outside the germinal center (GC) are B-cell chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia (B-CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and
  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. B-CLL and MCL differ in their
  molecular pathways, genomic alterations, and clinical behavior, being more aggressive
  in naive-like- than memory-like-derived tumors. The pathogenesis of the two malignancies
  involves the BCR signaling, tumor cell microenvironment interactions, genomic alterations,
  and epigenome modifications (; ). MALT lymphoma is the commonest MZL type and presents
  recurrent chromosomal translocations, which usually lead to activation of the NF-κB
  pathway. Nodal and splenic MZLs share recurrent mutations affecting the Notch pathway
  and the transcription factor KLF2, but differ for the inactivation of two tumor-suppressor
  genes, detected exclusively (PTPRD) or much more commonly (KMT2D/MLL2) in the nodal
  type (; ). The presence of immunoglobulin mutations is evidence that the cell of
  origin of the tumor passed through the GC microenvironment. Follicular lymphomas,
  Burkitt lymphomas, and DLBCLs express GC B cell signature genes. In the GC, two
  molecular processes remodel DNA: immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR)
  and somatic hypermutation (SHM), mechanisms that predispose to chromosomal translocations
  and mutations (). DLBCL is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease and
  accounts for 35% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on transcriptional profiles, DLBCL
  is further classified into activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB)
  subtypes (; ). ABC-DLBCLs derive from B cells that are committed to plasmablastic
  differentiation (). These tumors have increased NF-κB activity, genetic alterations
  in NF-κB modifiers and components of the BCR pathway, and perturbed terminal B-cell
  differentiation (; ). GCB-DLBCLs originate from light-zone GC B cells (; ). These
  tumors have frequent alterations in chromatin-modifying enzymes, PI3 K signaling,
  and genetic alterations of BCL2 (; ). Modifications in these pathways could favor
  epigenetic reprogramming and escape from cellular immunity. Recent genomic profiles
  have identified sub-ABC and GCB-DLBCL clusters: C1-C5 in one study (of which two
  are GCB-, two are ABC-subtypes, and the fifth is mostly characterized by genomic
  instability and TP53 mutations) (), BN2, MCD, N1 (mostly ABC), and EZB (mostly GCB)
  in a different study (). Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by a unique histology
  in which tumor B cells form follicle-like structures with large numbers of nonmalignant
  immune cells infiltrating within the follicular and interfollicular regions ().
  The most frequent genetic event is the t(14;18) translocation that places BCL2 under
  control of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer, which occurs in 90% of FL patients.
  Mutations in epigenetic modifiers (KMT2D, CREBBP, and EZH2) are also a hallmark
  of FL (). These mutations result in altering normal B-cell differentiation programs
  and impeding GC exit (). Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of the
  MYC gene through its translocation to one of the immunoglobulin loci (). LPL, lymphoplasmacytic
  lymphoma; WM, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.'
