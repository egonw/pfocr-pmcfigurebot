caption: Global RNA-seq analysis of RL95-2 cells treated with ADP-CM identified unique
  pathways. (A) Heatmap showing differentially expressed genes upon ADP-CM treatment
  with |FC | > 1.5. (B–D) GSEA showing positively enriched pathways in ADP-CM-treated
  cells. GSEA plots show JAK-STAT pathway (C) and interferon alpha (D) response gene
  signatures were positively enriched in ADP-CM-treated group. (E) Heatmap shows the
  regulation of several known STAT3 target genes in ADP-CM-treated cells. (F) Ingenuity
  pathway analysis shows the top 10 pathways upregulated in ADP-CM-treated cells.
  (G) Validation of LIFR target genes by RT-qPCR. Data are represented as mean ± SE.
  **** p < 0.0001.
