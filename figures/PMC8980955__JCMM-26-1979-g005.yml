caption: 'NAD+ protects against LPS‐induced mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative
  stress. (A) Levels of mitochondrial ROS were determined using a commercial kit in
  each group. (B) qRT‐PCR analysis for mtDNA copy numbers in kidneys. (C‐D) Basal
  OCR and maximal OCR represented as the basal mitochondrial OXPHOS activity and maximal
  respiratory capacity respectively. (E‐F) Kidney specimens in each group were processed
  for immunohistochemistry staining for iNOS (scale bars, 50 μm) and quantitative
  analysis for positive areas. (G) Kidney tissue was processed for electron micrographs
  of renal mitochondria (scale bars, 1 μm). Each result was replicated in three independent
  experiments and all values are the mean ±SD (n = 3). *Significance compared with
  CON (WT) group (*p<0.05, **p < 0.01). #Significance compared with LPS (WT) group
  (#p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01). $Significance compared with CON (KO) group ($p < 0.05,
  $$p < 0.01). ^Significance compared with LPS (KO) group (^p < 0.05, ^^p < 0.01)'
