caption: 'Nicotinamide (NAM) ameliorating oxidative stress and regulated the expression
  of the Nrf2 and HO-1 pathway in the Striatum and SNpc of mice. (a,b) Images of the
  scanned immunoblot results of Nrf2 and HO-1 and their graphical representation in
  the striatum and SNpc of the different experimental groups. β-actin was used as
  a loading control; (c) Graphical representation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  level in the striatum and SNpc of the different experimental groups; (d) Graphical
  representation of the results of the lipid peroxidation (LPO) assay in the different
  experimental groups. The values are expressed as the mean ± SD for indicated proteins
  (n = 10 mice/group), and the number of independent experiments was n = 3. * Significantly
  different from the control group, # Significantly different from the MPTP-treated
  group. Significance: * p < 0.05; # p < 0.05.'
