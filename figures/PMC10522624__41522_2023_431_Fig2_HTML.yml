figure_title: LGG metabolite profile is affected by fermentation
caption: A MetaCyc metabolic pathway of mixed acid fermentation pathway based on metabolomics
  analysis from LGG grown in TBS medium or TSB medium with glucose (1% W/V), mannose
  (1% W/V), or raffinose (1% W/V). Relative abundance of B Posphoenolpyruvate, C Pyruvate,
  D Acetylphosphate, E Malic acid, F Acetyl-CoA, G Lactic acidt, H Citerate, I Fumaric
  acid, J Succinate, and K Alpha-keto glutaric acid. The images represent 4 independent
  repetitions. Statistical analysis was performed using Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s
  ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically
  significant. L Chromatographic profile obtained by GC-MS of volatile compounds from
  LGG grown in TBS medium or TSB medium supplemented glucose (1% W/V).
