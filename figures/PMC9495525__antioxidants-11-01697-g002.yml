caption: Role of OLNZ in CV positive neuronal cells and F-J B histofluorescence neuronal
  cells in the hippocampus of CA1 domain. Identification of CV positive cells in the
  sham group (A) 10× and (a) 200×, TI-mediated ischemic stroke group (B) 10× and (b)
  200×, and TI-mediated ischemic stroke + OLNZ (10 mg/kg) group (C) 10× and (c) 200×.
  F-J B histofluorescent of the CA1 domain in the sham group (D) 10× and (d) 200×,
  TI-mediated ischemic stroke group (E) 10× and (e) 200×, and TI-mediated ischemic
  stroke + OLNZ (10 mg/kg) group (F) 10× and (f) 200×. In the TI-mediated stroke gerbils,
  the number of CV positive cells in the CA1 domain was reduced compared with the
  sham group, although a greater number of F-J B+ degenerative cells were distinguished
  in the hippocampus of the ischemic group compared to both the sham and TI-induced
  stroke + OLNZ treatment groups. (G) Graphs represent the relative numbers of CV+
  and (H) F-J B+ cells. Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 5 in each group.
  After performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests, p < 0.05 for comparisons
  of the treatment groups with the sham group (#) and p < 0.05 for comparisons with
  the TI-induced stroke group (*) were considered significant.
