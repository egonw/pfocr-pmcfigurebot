caption: The clinical significance of hsa_circ_0017728 in GC patients. Hsa_circ_0017728
  was up-regulated in 87.3% of GC patients (A). High Hsa_circ_0017728 expression in
  GC patients was closely associated with poorer pathological differentiation (B),
  higher TNM stage (C) and lymph node metastasis (D). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed
  to evaluate the correlation between hsa_circ_0017728 expression and overall survival/disease-free
  survival in GC patients (E). Hsa_circ_0017728 expression level was measured in five
  GC cell lines (AGS, BGC-823, MKN-28, MGC-803 and SGC-7901) and normal human gastric
  epithelial cell line GES-1 (F)*P < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 compared with the normal control
  group.
