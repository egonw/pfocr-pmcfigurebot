figure_title: Mechanistic diagram summarizing the regulatory effect of TGR5 in mitochondrial
  dysfunction and neuroinflammation in Müller cells
caption: TGR5 activation blocks GRP75-mediated MAMs formation and subsequently inhibits
  mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in Müller cells, which improves mitochondrial homeostasis
  and alleviates cGAS-STING pathway-mediated neuroinflammation.
article_title: TGR5 supresses cGAS/STING pathway by inhibiting GRP75-mediated endoplasmic
  reticulum-mitochondrial coupling in diabetic retinopathy.
