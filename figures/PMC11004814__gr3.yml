caption: 'GSEA analysis of Combined dataset. A: Mountain map of significant enrichment
  terms. Bâ€“F: The results of GSEA (each term). B: REACTOME_FATTY_ACID_METABOLISM.
  This pathway involves the metabolic processes of fatty acids within organisms. GSEA
  of this pathway demonstrated significant enrichment of genes related to fatty acids
  in the samples, implying an enhanced activity in the fatty acid metabolism pathway.
  C: KEGG_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION. This pathway is associated with the process of
  cellular energy production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Enrichment
  analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation
  in the samples, indicating a higher activity of oxidative phosphorylation within
  the cells. D: WP_ELECTRON_TRANSPORT_CHAIN_OXPHOS_SYSTEM_IN_MITOCHONDRIA: This is
  related to the oxidative phosphorylation system responsible for energy production
  within the mitochondria. Enrichment results indicated significant enrichment of
  these genes in the samples, suggesting an enhanced activity of the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway within the mitochondria. E: WP_OXIDATIVE_STRESS_RESPONSE: This pathway involves
  the cellular mechanisms responding to oxidative stress. Enrichment analysis showed
  enrichment of stress-related genes in the samples, suggesting that the cells may
  be under oxidative stress. F: WP_IL1_SIGNALING_PATHWAY: This pathway involves the
  IL-1 signaling transduction pathway. Enrichment results indicated a negative enrichment
  of genes related to signal transduction in the samples, implying a potential downregulation
  of the IL1 signaling pathway in the analyzed context. G: WP_ADIPOGENESIS: This pathway
  involves the processes of adipocyte differentiation and development. GSEA demonstrated
  enrichment of genes related to adipogenesis in the samples, indicating potential
  changes in the signaling pathways involved in adipocyte development and differentiation.
