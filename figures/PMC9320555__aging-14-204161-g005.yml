caption: Hedgehog signaling is required for BDDD-721 against medulloblastoma cells.
  (A) The cell viability of DAOY and ONS-76 cells were analyzed by MTT assay in DAOY
  and ONS-76 cells treated with BDDD-721 and/or SAG. (B) The cell viability of DAOY
  and ONS-76 cells were analyzed by MTT assay in DAOY and ONS-76 cells treated with
  BDDD-721 and/or cyclopamine. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in DAOY
  (C) and ONS-76 (D) cells treated with BDDD-721 and/or SAG. Then, cell apoptosis
  was detected by flow cytometry in DAOY (E) and ONS-76 (F) cells treated with BDDD-721
  and/or cyclopamine. (G) Column chart represents the percentage of apoptosis cells
  analyzed by SPSS statistical software.
article_title: Curcumin analogue BDDD-721 exhibits more potent anticancer effects
  than curcumin on medulloblastoma by targeting Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway.
