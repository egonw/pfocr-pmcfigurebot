figure_title: 'Figure 3. Conversion of PLA to PAA in adzuki cuttings. (A) LC-MS/MS
  (ESI) determined concentrations of endogenous PAA in adzuki cuttings treated with
  PLA for 24 h. Results reported as means±SD (n=3). (B) Schematic diagram of the metabolic
  pathways of PAA and IAA biosynthesis in plants. Black arrows indicate pathways reported
  in plants. Dashed arrows indicate the predicted pathway catalyzing the conversion
  of PLA and ILA to PAA and IAA, respectively, in plants. Abbreviations: Phe, phenylalanine;
  Trp, tryptophan; PPA, phenylpyruvic acid; IPA, indole-3-pyruvic acid. (C) LC-MS/MS
  (ESI) determined concentrations of endogenous IAA in adzuki cuttings treated with
  ILA for 24 h. Results reported as means±SD (n=3). * p<0.05 compared with distilled
  water treatment by Student’s t-test'
