caption: Overexpression of ANKRD29 inhibited cell proliferation and regulated cell
  cycle. A-B qRT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) assays were used to verify the overexpression
  of ANKRD29 in SPC-A1 and H1975 cell lines. The red arrow indicated the target band
  of ANKRD29 protein. C-G Overexpression of ANKRD29 obviously inhibited SPC-A1 cell
  growth through growth curve (C), BrdU incorporation abilities (D-E) and colony formation
  (F-G). (E) and (G) Quantification data for (D) and (F), respectively. H-I Overexpression
  of ANKRD29 induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase analyzed by flow cytometry assay.
  (I) Quantification data for (H). J ANKRD29 elevated expression downregulated the
  protein level of CDK2 and CDK6. Scale bar = 50 μm. Bars are the mean value ± SD.
  ns = no significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001
