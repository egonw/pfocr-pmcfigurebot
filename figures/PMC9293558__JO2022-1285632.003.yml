caption: Two RNA modification patterns of LUAD showed distinct cancer hallmarks and
  tumor microenvironments. (a) Kaplanâ€“Meier curves showed the different overall survival
  of LUAD patients in two RNA modification clusters. (b) The heatmap revealed that
  most cancer hallmarks were enriched in LUAD patients in the RNA modification cluster
  (b). (c) The box plot showed that immune cells infiltrated in tumor microenvironments
  were distinct in two RNA modification clusters. (d) The box plot showed the immune
  score and stromal score of LUAD patients in two RNA modification clusters. (e) The
  box plot showed the enrichment score of immune-related pathways in two RNA modification
  clusters. (f) The correlations between infiltrated immunes cells and RNA modification
  regulators. NLR, nod-like receptor signaling pathway; TCR, T cell receptor signaling
  pathway; BCR, B cell receptor signaling pathway; TLR, toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway; NKL, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity; CCRI, cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction; CSP, chemokine signaling pathway.
