caption: (A) Western Blot analyses of phospho- and total p44/42 MAP kinase (Erk1/Erk2)
  were performed on cells cultured in basal condition, 5, and 15 min after HGF administration
  (40 ng/mL). (B) Graphical representation of densitometric analyses of the bands
  (* vs. CTRL p < 0.05). Results are expressed in fold change, with the control considered
  as 1 (Â± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)). Four independent experiments were
  performed.
