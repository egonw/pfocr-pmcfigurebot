caption: 'GDF15 upregulates the insulin secretion pathway. A: Extracellular acidification
  rate (ECAR) in β-TC-6 cells treated with rmGDF15 under 0.5 mmol/L glucose condition
  was determined using Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analysis (n = 6). B: Glucose-stimulated
  (1 mmol/L) ECAR in β-TC-6 cells treated with rmGDF15 (n = 6). C: The ratio of ATP
  to ADP (ATP/APD) in β-TC-6 cells treated with rmGDF15 in the presence or absence
  of 1 mmol/L glucose (n = 9–12). D: Representative image of intracellular calcium
  influx in response to K+ stimulation in β-TC-6 cells treated with vehicle or rmGDF15
  (n = 4). Changes in intracellular calcium levels in β-TC-6 cells treated with rmGDF15
  in response to K+ stimulation are shown in the inserted graph (n = 3 repeated cultures,
  n = 6 replicates/culture). E: Glucose-stimulated ECAR in β-TC-6 cells at passage
  5 treated with 5 ng/mL rmGDF15 under 1 mmol/L glucose conditions was determined
  by Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analysis (n = 4 repeated cultures, n = 7–8 replicates/culture).
  F: Illustration of GDF15 effect on the insulin secretion pathway. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with control by paired t test for (A
  and B), two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test for C, and one-way ANOVA followed
  by unpaired t test for D. Ab, antibody; max, maximum; min, minimum; neut, neutralizing;
  Veh, vehicle. Rot, rotenone; AmA, antimycin A; Oligo, oligomycin.'
