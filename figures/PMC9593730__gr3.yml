caption: KLF15 is critical in the regulation of BAT response to cold(A) Continuous
  core body temperature measurement using implantable temperature telemetry devices
  in K15 F/F vs K15-BKO during chronic cold challenge followed by fasting (n = 6).(B)
  Seahorse Mito Stress assay depicting the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) from primary
  brown adipocytes isolated from K15 F/F and K15-BKO mice (n = 6). Brown adipocyte
  oxygen consumption rate was normalized to protein concentration per well.(C) Basal
  oxygen consumption rate from BAT from K15 F/F and K15-BKO at RT (n = 6).(D) K-means
  clustering of DEGs from RNA-seq of K15 F/F RT (fed) vs C + F (n = 3).(E) KEGG pathway
  analysis of upregulated DEGs from RNA-seq of K15 F/F RT (fed) vs C + F.(F) PCA of
  top 10,000 highest expressed genes in K15 F/F showing clustering of cold and C +
  F conditions together.(G) Average fpkm of all genes within KEGG pathway gene set
  for BCAA metabolism and fatty acid metabolism for K15 F/F at RT, K15 F/F in cold,
  and K15-BKO in cold. Comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired, 2-tailed
  Student’s t test for panels (B) and (C) and two-way ANOVA for (G). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
