caption: The Pathway of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation in the Liver. Long-chain
  fatty acids are transported into the liver via a complex of proteins consisting
  of fatty acid translocase (FAT, aka CD36), liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP),
  caveolins and phospholipase A2 (PL). In the cytosol fatty acids are activated into
  fatty acyl-CoA by the actions of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL). Acyl-CoAs
  are unable to diffuse out of the cell and are committed to different cellular processes
  such as lipid synthesis or oxidation. The metabolic fate of acyl-CoAs is likely
  mediated by unique ACSL isoforms. Another pathway that mediates fatty acid import
  into the hepatocytes is via fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5). This enzyme
  complex additionally contains very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 6 (ACSVL6) activity
  to generate Acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs designated for energy production are conjugated
  to carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (CPA1a). This is the rate
  limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation accounting for 80% of the control over the
  pathway. Carnitine is transported into the hepatocytes by OCTN2. Acyl-carnitines
  can cross outer mitochondrial membrane and are transported across the inner mitochondrial
  membrane by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) in an exchange for free carnitine
  transported from mitochondrial matrix into inter membrane space. Inside the mitochondrial
  matrix carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) converts acyl-carnitines into free
  carnitine and acyl-CoA. Beta oxidation involves a four-step process where long chain
  acyl-CoA are progressively shortened by two carbons to generate acetyl-CoA and two
  electrons. The first step dehydrogenates acyl-CoA into 2-enoly-CoA, and is mediated
  by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) of different chain lengths. This dehydrogenation
  step yields FADH2, which donates electrons to complex II of the mitochondrial electron
  transport (ETC) chain for ATP production. The next three steps are mediated by mitochondrial
  trifunctional protein (MTP). The second step is hydration step and it produces 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  by the action of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratases (ECH). The third step is another dehydrogenation
  step mediated by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) to produce 3-ketoacyl-CoA.
  This dehydrogenation step yields NADH, which donates electrons to complex I of the
  mitochondrial ETC chain for ATP production. The fourth step is mediated by acetyl-CoA
  acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2) to produce shortened acyl-CoA chain and acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA
  can be further reduced in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and it yields citrate when
  energy stores are plentifully. During fasting, acetyl-CoA may be converted to ketone
  bodies that are used during fasting as energy source in other tissue.
