figure_title: Nif synergizes with Pal to promote tumor senescence
caption: A Cell viability of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells after co-treated with increasing
  concentrations of Nif (0-20 μM) and Pal (0–10 μM) for 3 days. CI < 1 indicated a
  synergism effect. B Colony formation assays to verify the long-term anti-proliferation
  effect after the combination treatment for 7 days. C Cells were treated for 24 h,
  and the cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. D Representative
  images and quantification of SA-β-galactosidase staining were measured after 3 days
  of treatment. Green indicates positive staining. Scale Bar:25 μm. E Representative
  images of BrdU staining after 3 days of treatment. Scale Bar:50 μm. F Western blot
  analysis of p21- RB senescence signaling pathway after 3 days of treatment. All
  data represent mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments; **P < 0.01.
