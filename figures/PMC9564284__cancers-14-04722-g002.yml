caption: Validation of LETM2 prognostic value and clinical significance for pancreatic
  cancer in TCGA database. (A) TCGA + GTEx database analysis revealed that LETM2 expression
  was significantly elevated in PDAC tumor tissue in comparison with normal tissue.
  Red represents tumor tissue and blue represents normal tissue. (B,C) High levels
  of LETM2 expression correlated with significantly poor (B) OS and (C) DFS of PDAC
  patients based on survival analysis of the TCGA database. The dotted lines represented
  95% confidence intervals. (D) LETM2 expression correlated with tumor inflammation
  signature. (E) LETM2 expression correlated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. (F) LETM2
  expression correlated with the P53 pathway. (G) LETM2 expression correlated with
  immune infiltration level of B cell expression. (H) LETM2 expression correlated
  with immune infiltration level of T cell CD8+ expression. (I) Sankey diagram demonstrated
  the association between LETM2 expression and histological grade and living status.
