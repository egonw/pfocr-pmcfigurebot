caption: 'Rh1 inhibits the activation of the ERK1/2/p90RSK signaling pathway induced
  by Ang II. (A,B) RASMCs were pretreated with Rh1 (25 and 50 µM) for 1 h before being
  incubated with Ang II (100 nM) for 1 h. (C,D) The cells were preincubated with 20
  µM FMK or 10 µM U0126 and/or 50 µM Rh1 for 1 h, and then exposed to Ang II for 1
  h. (A–D) Western blot analysis was used to analyze the levels of the indicated proteins
  in the whole-cell lysates. (B,D) Results are represented as means ± SEM (n = 4),
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,
  and ### p < 0.001 compared with the Ang II-treated sample. FMK: p90RSK inhibitor,
  U0126: ERK1/2 inhibitor.'
