caption: 'Detection of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in rat sera after different
  interventions. (A) Detection of TNF-α in rat sera after the different interventions.
  (B) Detection of IL-1β in rat sera after the different interventions. (C) Detection
  of IL-6 in rat sera after the different interventions. (D) Detection of IFN-γ in
  rat sera after the different interventions. Blank: normal untreated rats; TNBS:
  colitic rats; TNBS + FMT: colitic rats treated with fecal microbiota transplantation;
  TNBS + Ped: colitic rats treated with prednisone; TNBS + SB431542: colitic rats
  treated with the TGF-β1 inhibitor SB431542. *, P<0.05 vs. the Blank group; #, P<0.05
  vs. the TNBS group. IL, interleukin; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor α; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.'
