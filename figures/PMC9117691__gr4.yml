caption: KLF4 inhibits the transcription of MSI2 expression in non-small cell lung
  cancer cell lines. (A) Western blotting assay of KLF4 expression in A549 and H520
  cells transfected with siRNA targeting KLF4 (si-KLF4-1, si-KLF4-2, si-KLF4-3 and
  si-KLF4-4). Reverse transcription-quantitative assays of MSI2 expression in A549
  and H520 cells transfected with (B) pKLF4 or (C) si-KLF4-2. (D-E) Fold enrichment
  of ChIP assay in A549 demonstrated the direct binding of KLF4 to MSI2’s promoter.
  (D) A549 and H520 cells were co-transfected with MSI2 and pKLF4, si-KLF4-2 or control
  vector. Promoter activity in the cells was examined using a dual-luciferase reporter
  assay. The results were obtained from four independent experiments and are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, ⁎⁎P<0.01, ⁎⁎⁎P<0.001. KLF4, Krüppel-like factor 4; MSI2,
  Musashi-2; si-, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; pKLF4, KLF4 overexpression
  plasmid.
