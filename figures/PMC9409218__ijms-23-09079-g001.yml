caption: 'Metabolic pathways changes in crop leaves under N deficiency. N deficiency
  inhibits the N assimilation pathway and TCA cycle, resulting in large decreases
  in amino acids, while it accumulates tolerance-related metabolites for reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. The accumulated and reduced metabolites are marked
  in red and blue, respectively. Abbreviations: P (phosphate), PEP (phosphoenolpyruvic
  acid), GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid), TCA (tricarboxylic acid), GS/GOGAT (glutamine
  synthetase/glutamate synthetase).'
