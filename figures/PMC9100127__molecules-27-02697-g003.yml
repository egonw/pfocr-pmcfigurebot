caption: DHCE induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. (A) MGC803 and SGC7901 cells
  were treated with different concentrations of DHCE for 24 h, and the apoptosis level
  was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. (B) Western blot was used to
  detect the expression levels of Bad, Bax and Bcl-xl in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells.
  The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the statistical results are expressed
  as means ± SD (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group).
