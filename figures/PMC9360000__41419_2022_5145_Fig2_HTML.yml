figure_title: OTUD1 downregulates inflammatory cytokine-induced canonical NF-κB activation
caption: a The enhanced ubiquitination and recruitment of NF-κB signaling factors
  to TNFR complex I. Parental and OTUD1−/−-HeLa cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml
  FLAG-TNF-α for the indicated periods, and cell lysates and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates
  were subjected to immunoblotting with the depicted antibodies. b K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of NF-κB activators is enhanced in OTUD1−/− cells. Parental and OTUD1−/−-HeLa cells
  were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for the indicated periods, and then pulled down
  by K63-TUBE. Samples were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.
  c The enhanced IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation in OTUD1−/− cells. Parental and OTUD1−/−
  cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β, and analyzed as in a. d, e Alterations
  of K63- and M1-linked ubiquitination of NF-κB activators in OTUD1−/−-HeLa cells.
  Parental and OTUD1−/− cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β for the indicated
  periods, and pulled down by K63-TUBE (d) or M1-TUBE (e). Samples were immunoblotted
  with the indicated antibodies. f, g RNA-seq analysis. Parental and OTUD1−/−-HeLa
  cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 1 and 3 h. The cells were lysed and
  subjected to a transcriptome-wide expression analysis using their extracted total
  RNA. The principal component analysis (f) and heatmap analysis of significantly
  varied 34 mRNAs, using the cut-off value of 10 (g) was performed. h The enhanced
  inflammatory responses in OTUD1−/−-HeLa cells. Taking the cut-off value of 3.0,
  pathway analyses of 175 up-regulated genes were performed by MSigDB Hallmark 2020,
  and are listed in ascending order of P-value.
