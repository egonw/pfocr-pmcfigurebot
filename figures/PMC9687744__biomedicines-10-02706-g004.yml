caption: 'Pathogenesis of thrombosis producing its primary and secondary phenotypes
  based on â€œtwo-path unifying theory of hemostasis. Thrombogenesis following an intravascular
  injury may take two different paths. For example, in sepsis the intravascular injury
  is limited to ECs but disseminated. The damage releases ULVWF/FVIII and activates
  ULVWF path (microthrombotic pathway) that produces microthrombi strings, eventually
  leading to microthrombosis (e.g., aEA-VMTD). However, in a local trauma the intravascular
  injury is extended from ECs to SET/EVT but localized, which releases TF and small
  amount of ULVWF/FVIII and activates TF path (traumatic pathway) that produces blood
  clots composed of fibrin meshes, small amount of ULVWF/FVIII and platelets, and
  NETs, leading to macrothrombosis (e.g., DVT). Sometimes the septic patient with
  disseminated microthrombi strings due to endotheliopathy admitted to ICU could also
  develop another unrelated serious vascular damage to SET/EVT due to an indwelling
  vascular device in ICU care, which releases TF and promote fibrinogenesis that forms
  fibrin meshes. In this case, combined micro-macrothrombi composed of ternary components
  of ULVWF/FVIII, platelets, and fibrin meshes could be formed and lead to combined
  micro-macrothrombosis shown in the Figure with clinical phenotypes. The thrombosis
  due to EA-VMTD and another vascular injury is a complex form of micro-macrothrombosis.
  Their thrombogeneses are logical and has been explained in the text and my previous
  publications [,]. Abbreviations: AAT, aortic arch thrombosis; aEA-VMTD, arterial
