caption: Relationship between the honokiol microemulsion exposure period and the toxic
  response. (A) Survival rates of zebrafish embryos at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpf. (B)
  Hatching rates of zebrafish embryos at 72 and 96 hpf. (C) Malformation rates of
  zebrafish at 96 hpf. The data are expressed as the mean Â± SD (* p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 compared with control embryos).
