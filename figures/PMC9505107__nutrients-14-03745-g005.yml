caption: 'Differential taxa, metabolic pathways, and correlation analysis. (A) Volcano
  map showing differential metabolic pathways between the gut microbiota of dextran
  sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced and Lactobacillus gasseri G098 (G098) groups (cut-off:
  p < 0.05 and FC ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5). Each dot represents one detected pathway. Differential
  metabolic pathways are shown in red and are annotated. (B) Spearman’s correlation
  heatmap showing association between differential taxa, metabolic pathways, serum
  cytokine levels, and disease activity index. * and ** represent p < 0.05 and p <
  0.01, respectively. The color scale represents r-value.'
