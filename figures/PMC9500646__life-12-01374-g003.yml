caption: The effects of TG (5, 10 µg) and TG10 + PBA on (A) the time spent in the
  target quadrant, (B) the latency to the first cross of the platform, and (C) the
  mean heat-map visualization of animal performance in the probe test. The solid arrow
  is showing a hot zone in target zone showing animal spend more time in this area
  and dashed lines is showing the wrong zone which is less explored. * Significantly
  different from the control (p < 0.05). Data are represented as mean ± SEM (N = 7–9).
  Thapsigargin (TG), 4-Phenylbutyric acid (PBA).
