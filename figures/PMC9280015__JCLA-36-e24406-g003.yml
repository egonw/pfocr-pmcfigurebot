caption: 'LINC00941 silencing inhibited the invasion and glycolysis of laryngocarcinoma
  cells by downregulating PKM level. (A‐C) The invasion ability of SNU‐46 and SNU‐899
  cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or PKM overexpression vector or co‐transfected
  with shLINC00941 vector and PKM vector was determined by Transwell invasion assay
  (magnification: ×250; scale: 50 µm). (D‐G) The glucose consumption and lactate production
  of SNU‐46 and SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or PKM overexpression
  vector or co‐transfected with shLINC00941 vector and PKM vector were assessed by
  the colorimetric method. **p < 0.01; ***p or ^^^p or +++p < 0.001; * vs. Empty vector;
  ^ vs. shLINC00941; + vs. shLINC00941+PKM (PKM, pyruvate kinase M/pyruvate kinase
  M vector; shLINC00941, short hairpin RNA vector for LINC00941)'
article_title: LINC00941 promoted in vitro progression and glycolysis of laryngocarcinoma
  by upregulating PKM via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
