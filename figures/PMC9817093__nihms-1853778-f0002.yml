figure_title: A shunt-within-a-shunt for propionate degradation
caption: 'a, MS/MS networking revealed four structurally related metabolites (highlighted
  with green edges) that are enriched in DL238. MS/MS fragmentation and molecular
  formulae suggested that these compounds are 3HP-AA conjugates. b, Quantification
  of 3HP-AAs from exo-metabolome extracts of the four strains. Data represent six
  biologically independent experiments and bars indicate mean ± s.d. c, Canonical
  (boxed) and shunt metabolic pathways for propionyl-CoA degradation. Under B12-replete
  conditions, propionate shunt genes are transcriptionally repressed, and propionyl-CoA
  is metabolized to succinyl-CoA. Under B12-deficient conditions, propionyl-CoA is
  degraded by the propionate shunt pathway. 3HP is an intermediate in the propionate
  shunt and accumulates in hphd-1(ok3580) mutant animals. d, Quantification of 3HP-AAs
  from exo-metabolome extracts of the DL238 strain fed the standard E. coli OP50 diet
  without (light blue) or with supplementation of 64 nM vitamin B12 (purple). Data
  represent three biologically independent experiments and bars indicate mean ± s.d.
  e, Quantification of 3HP-AAs from exo-metabolome extracts of N2 and hphd-1(ok3580)
  animals. Data represent four biologically independent experiments and bars indicate
  mean ± s.d. f, 13C5-Val isotope tracing experiment. N2 and hphd-1(ok3580) animals
  were supplemented with Val or 13C5-Val and analyzed for isotopic enrichment. g,
  EICs (negative ion) for m/z 188.0928 in N2 and hphd-1(ok3580) mutants supplemented
  with 13C5-Val. 3HP-Val (arrow) is more abundant in the hphd-1(ok3580) mutant. Inset:
  averaged mass spectra from the region-of-interest (denoted by red bracket) reveal
  13C3, 13C5, and 13C8 enrichment in 3HP-Val (13C1 natural abundance shown for scale).
  Distribution of 13C enrichment in 3HP-Val resulting from 13C5-Val supplement are
  highlighted with green shading. Source data are provided as a . For b, d, and e,
  p-values calculated by unpaired, two-sided t-test with Welch correction. ns, not
  significant'
