caption: KLF4 expression is downregulated in human IPF lung tissue and in bleomycin-induced
  fibrosis of HFL-1 cells in vitro. A volcano map exhibits significant number of differentially
  expressed genes between the IPF and control groups (a). Red, blue, and gray bubbles
  imply upregulated genes, downregulated genes, and nonsignificantly-changed genes,
  respectively. Different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 250, 300, and 400 µg/mL) of
  bleomycin were used to induce HFL-1 cells. After 24 h, the cell viability was tested
  (b), and the mRNA expression levels of collagen I and collagen Ⅲ were determined
  by qRT-PCR (c,d). At 200 µg/mL BLM concentration, a Western blotting assay was conducted
  to determine the protein expression levels of collagen Ⅰ, collagen Ⅲ, and KLF4 (e–g).
  The values are expressed as mean ± SD. n = 3 for each group. * p < 0.05 and ** p
  < 0.01 for t-test.
