caption: Vincristine increases sensitivity to RSL3 via targeting SUFU-YAP-ACSL4 axis(A)
  Immunoblot (IB) analysis of SUFU abundance in HCC1954, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells
  upon treatment with indicated compounds for 24 h. GAPDH was used as a loading control.(B)
  IB analysis of SUFU, AXL, ACSL4, and P-YAP127 levels in HCC1954, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231
  cells upon treatment with increasing doses of vincristine for 24h.(C) Confocal analysis
  of YAP nuclear localization in HCC1954 (lower panels) and MDA-MB-231 (upper panels)
  cells following the vincristine treatment for 24h; scale bar, 50μm.(D) IB analysis
  showing the increase in the levels of AXL and ACSL4 in HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  upon a 24 h exposure to vincristine was mitigated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of
  YAP.(E) Viability (%) of MCF-7 and T47D cells treated with vehicle, vincristine,
  RSL3, or the combination of vincristine and RSL3.(F) Tumor growth measurement in
  mouse xenograft derived from MCF-7. An intra-tumor injection was performed with
  vehicle, RSL3 (40 mg/kg), RSL3 (100 mg/kg) vincristine (30 μg/kg), or the combination
  of RSL3 (40 mg/kg) and vincristine (30 μg/kg), n = 5 in each group.(G) Hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E), Ki67, SUFU, and ACSL4-stained images of tumor tissues from tumors
  treated as in f; scale bar, 100μm. Data are presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Unpaired t
  test).
