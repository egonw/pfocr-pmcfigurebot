caption: 'HSF2BP inhibits JNK signaling via a CDC73-dependent pathway. Liver is induced
  by 1-hour ischemia followed by 24-hour reperfusion in HSF2BP-TG and NTG mice. Sham
  mice received all procedures except for hepatic ischemia. Primary hepatocytes of
  HSF2BP-TG and NTG mice were isolated and treated under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)
  condition (Culture under glucose/FBS free 1640 medium and hypoxia condition for
  1 h, then transferred to glucose/FBS-rich medium and normoxia condition for 8 h).
  Western blot analysis of JNK signaling (p-MKK4, p-JNK and p-c-Jun) (A) and their
  quantitative results (B) after hepatic I/R in HSF2BP-TG and NTG mice. Results are
  expressed as mean ± SE (n = 4–6/group) and compared by one-way ANOVA. * p < 0.05
  versus sham mice, # p < 0.05 versus NTG mice. Western blot analysis of JNK signaling
  (p-MKK4, p-JNK and p-c-Jun) (C) and their quantitative results (D–F) in primary
  hepatocytes isolated from HSF2BP-TG and NTG mice and transfected with siRNA-CDC73.
  Western blot analysis of ER stress-related proteins (GRP78, p-IRE1α and CHOP) (G)
  and their quantitative results (H–J) in primary hepatocytes isolated from HSF2BP-TG
  and NTG mice and transfected with siRNA-CDC73. Results are expressed as mean ± SE
  (n = 3–4/group) and compared by t-test. * p < 0.05'
