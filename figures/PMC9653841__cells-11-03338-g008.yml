caption: 'ADSC and HGF cotreatment inhibit profibrotic TGF-β1/Smad signaling. Legend:
  Control, LF group—liver fibrosis in diabetic mice; LFC group—self-recovery of liver
  fibrosis (positive control) in diabetic mice; ADSC group—ADSC treatment of liver
  fibrosis in diabetic mice; HGF group—HGF treatment of liver fibrosis in diabetic
  mice; ADSC + HGF group—ADSC and HGF cotreatment of liver fibrosis in diabetic mice
  (A). RT-PCR analysis of Smad2 gene level; *** p < 0.001 compared with control; **
  p < 0.01 compared with control; ### p < 0.001 compared with the LF group; ^^^ p
  < 0.001 compared with the LFC group. (B). Immunofluorescence expression of Smad2
  in experimental livers: (a) control, (b) LF, (c) LFC, (d) ADSC, (e) HGF, (f) ADSC
  + HGF. (C). RT-PCR analysis of the Smad7 gene level; *** p < 0.001 compared with
  control; * p < 0.05 compared with control; ## p < 0.01 compared with the LF group;
  ^ p < 0.05 compared with the LFC group. (D). RT-PCR analysis of the TGF-β1 gene
  level; *** p < 0.001 compared with control; ### p < 0.001 compared with the LF group;
  ^^ p < 0.01 compared with the LFC group; ^ p < 0.05 compared with the LFC group.
  (E) Immunohistochemical expression of TGF-β1 in experimental livers: (a) control,
