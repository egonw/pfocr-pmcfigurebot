figure_title: Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling is implicated in the enhanced vasoconstrictor
  response in F2 LPS-P offspring
caption: a Illustration of Gβγ Signaling pathway. Genes marked with red border own
  hypomethylated DMRs within its DNA sequence identified in aortic MeDIP-Seq data
  of F2 LPS-P offspring relative to control offspring. Genes marked with purple border
  belong to PI3K-Akt signaling. b Protein levels of phosphorylated (p)-Aktser473,
  p-S6Ser235/236, Akt, and S6 in thoracic aortas of F2 offspring at the age of 16
  weeks were determined by immunoblotting. β-actin was taken as internal control.
  Representative plots of two from eight offspring in each group (left) and statistical
  data of relative densitometry, normalized by β-actin (right), are shown. Data are
  presented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0 .01 denote the statistical comparison
  between the two marked groups (unpaired Student’s t test). c, d Effect of PI3K inhibitor
  LY294002 on the vascular reactivity of aortic rings from 16-week-old F2 offspring.
  PE-induced cumulative concentration–response curves (c) and Ach-induced relaxation–response
  curves (d) were measured in endothelia-intact aortic rings after 30 min treatment
  with LY294002 (20 μM) or vehicle control, as described in Fig. . Data are presented
  as means ± SEM. n = 8 from 4 litters for each group. * P < 0.05 and ** P < 0 .01
  denote the statistical comparison between the two marked groups (two-way ANOVA followed
  Sidak’s multiple comparisons test for c and d). The pD2 (–log EC50) values were
  calculated for each group and shown on the bottom of each panel.
