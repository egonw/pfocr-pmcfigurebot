figure_title: Phosphoproteomics analysis identifies FGFR2b internalisation- and recycling-dependent
  signalling pathways
caption: a Workflow of the phosphoproteomics experiment in HeLa cells transiently
  expressing FGFR2b (HeLa_FGFR2b) and either GFP, DnRAB11 or DnDNM2 and treated with
  FGF10 for 40 min. UT, treatment with vehicle as control. b Principal component analysis
  (PCA) of the HeLa phosphoproteome from 2a showed small variation between technical
  replicates and separated samples based on experimental conditions. c t-distributed
  stochastic neighbour embedding (t-sne) analysis identified 11 clusters corresponding
  to phosphorylated peptides differentially regulated among four conditions. Colour
  corresponds to the cluster with the highest membership score, determined using fuzzy
  c-means clustering based on the median z-score of the four conditions. Each cluster
  is identified by a unique colour and corresponding number. Opacity corresponds to
  the membership score assigned to each phosphorylated site within its most likely
  cluster. Membership scores and t-sne coordinates are available in Source Data File.
  d Plots of the median z-scored intensities of phosphorylated sites based on the
  11 clusters from Fig. 2c identified membrane response (red; clusters 3 and 4), internalisation
  response (light blue; clusters 5 and 8), and recycling response (dark blue; clusters
  9 and 11). Colour key indicates membership value assigned by Fuzzy c-means clustering.
  e Plots of the median z-scored intensities of phosphorylated sites based on the
  three main clusters identified in Fig. 2d. HeLa_FGFR2b (yellow) and T47D (dark green)
  were treated as in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. , respectively. f KEGG pathway
  enrichment (calculated with Fisher’s exact test and FDR adjustment) between HeLa_FGFR2b
  and T47D phosphorylated proteins within the membrane (red), internalisation (light
  blue) and recycling (dark blue) responses (Fig. 2d) identified mTOR signalling as
  associated with FGFR2b recycling. The size of dot indicates statistical significance
  based on p value. g Visualisation of the subcellular localisation of the phosphorylated
  proteins belonging to the mTOR signalling pathway KEGG term in HeLa_FGFR2b (yellow)
  and T47D (green) using SubCellularVis.
