figure_title: Effects of fucoidan on the cytotoxicity in HaCaT (A) and A549 (B) cells.
  Both cells were incubated with fucoidan (0–500 µg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The
  cytotoxicity effect was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide assay. The data were shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 4)
caption: '*P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance when compared with
  the untreated control.'
