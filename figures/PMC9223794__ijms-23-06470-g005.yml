caption: Different roles of TNFRSF25 and TNFRSF12A in non- and metastasis conditions
  of oral cancer. (A) Significant TNF signaling pathway communications were altered
  in non- vs. metastasis conditions between p-EMT and eCAF/myCAF clusters. (B) TNF
  signaling pathway-related gene expression in integrated single-cell RNA-seq of fibroblasts
  and epithelial cells in non- vs. metastasis conditions. (C) Survival plots of head
  and neck cancer patients with high TNFRSF25 (left panel) and TNFRSF12A (right panel)
  expression from TCGA database. (D) Proportion of TNFRSF12A expression in head and
  neck cancer patients from Human Protein Atlas. (E) Top 100 TNFRSF12A-correlated
  genes in integrated single-cell RNA-seq of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. (F)
  Co-expression (left) and scatter (right) plots of TNFRSF12A (red) and SNAI2 (green)
  in integrated single-cell RNA-seq of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in non- (0)
  vs. metastasis (1) conditions. (G) Correlation plots of TNFRSF12A and SNAI2 gene
  expressions in HNSCC non-tumor samples (normal cells) and tumor tissues from TCGA
  database. (H) Conceptual diagram (visualized by BiorRender) of p-EMT cells and CAFs
  communication in non- vs. metastasis oral squamous cell carcinomas via TWEAK (TNFSF12)-DR3
  (TNFRSF25)/TWEAKR (TNFRSF12A).
