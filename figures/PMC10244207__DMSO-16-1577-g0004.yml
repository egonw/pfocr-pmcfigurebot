caption: 'Irisin restrained HG-induced EMT, the expressions of fibrosis-related proteins
  and mitochondrial changes in Hk-2 cells through the stimulation of Smad4/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. (A–E) Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to analyze the protein
  and mRNA levels of Smad4 and β-catenin in HK-2 cells (48h). (F–H) After co-treatment
  with high glucose and siSmad4, the expressions of Smad4 and β-catenin in Hk-2 cells
  were examined using Western blot (48h). (I and J) The mRNA levels of Smad4 and β-catenin
  analyzed by RT-qPCR (24h). (K) The mitochondria morphology in the cells was observed
  by Mitotracker staining. Size: 10 microns (L) JC-1 staining was used to assess changes
  in mitochondrial membrane potential, which were then seen under a confocal microscope.
  Size: 25μm. All experiments were performed individually, and at least 3 more replicates
  were performed. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05 vs NG group, **p <
  0.01 vs NG group, #p < 0.05 vs HG group, ##p < 0.01 vs HG group, ###p < 0.001 vs
  HG group, @p< 0.05 vs HG+siNC group, @@p < 0.01 vs HG+siNC group.'
