caption: GLUT4 translocation is independent of insulin‐stimulated AKT signalling pathway.
  Adult female Sprague Dawley rats were placed in critical care environment entailing
  deep sedation, CMV, and immobilization for 8 or 3 days [8DES; n = 9 or 3DES; n = 3;
  stimulated (STIM; open diamonds), SHAM control (SHAM; closed diamonds)] and without
  (8D; n = 5 or 3DES; n = 3; closed squares) supramaximal ES and compared with control
  (CNT; filled circles; n = 5). (A) Heat map of top DEGs pertaining to insulin signalling.
  (B) Representative western blot with graph showing densitometry measured in arbitrary
  units (A.U) of P‐AKT at s473 and t308, total AKT, P‐AMPK at t172, total AMPK and
  total protein following 8 days of ventilation. (C) Representative western blot of
  P‐AMPK at t172, total AMPK, P‐TBC1D4 at ser588 TBC1D4 at t642, total TBC1D4 and
  total protein, with graph showing densitometry measured in AU of P‐AMPK at t172
  following 3 days of ventilation. (D) Transcript expression of TBC1D4 during 8DES.
  (E) Graphs showing densitometry measured in AU of P‐TBC1D4 at t642 following 3 days
  of ventilation. (F) Graphs showing densitometry measured in AU of P‐TBC1D4 at ser588
  following 3 days of ventilation. *P < 0.05 significantly different from control
  or +P < 0.05 significantly different with 8DES, as determined by one‐way ANOVA.
