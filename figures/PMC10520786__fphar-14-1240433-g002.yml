caption: Mechanisms that flavones regulate the Nrf2 signaling pathway, including intervening
  the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1 via PKC-mediated Nrf2 phosphorylation and P62-mediated
  Keap1 autophagic degradation; regulating Nrf2 nuclear translocation by various kinases
  like AMPK, MAPKs, Fyn; disturbing Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation via sirt1
  and PI3K/AKT/GSK3 axis. Besides, apigenin and luteolin can regulate Nrf2 expression
  through epigenetic alternation such as demethylation at the promoter region and
  histone acetylation.
