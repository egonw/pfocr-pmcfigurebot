caption: TSPAN31 regulates the proliferation, tumor growth, and apoptosis of GC cells.
  (A and B) Determination of the expression level of TSPAN31 in GC cells transfected
  with siTSPAN31 and Lv-TSPAN31 OE by qRT-PCR. (C and D) The optical density (OD value)
  of GC cells transfected with si-TSPAN31 and Lv-TSPAN31 OE was measured at 450 nm
  by the CCK-8 assay. (E and F) The clonogenic of GC cells transfected with si-TSPAN31
  and Lv-TSPAN31 OE was determined by the clone formation assay. (G and H) The apoptosis
  level of GC cells transfected with si-TSPAN31 and Lv-TSPAN31 OE was determined by
  the apoptosis assay. (I and J) The effect of si-TSPAN31 and LV-TSPAN31 OE transfection
  on GC tumor growth was detected by tumor bearing experiment in nude mice (*P < 0.05;
  ⁎⁎P < 0.01; ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001).
