caption: SPTLC2 can affect the proliferation, migration, invasion, and S1P production
  of HepG2 cells. After HepG2 cells were transfected with siR-NC (SPTLC2 small interfering
  RNA negative control), siR-SPTLC2 (SPTLC2 small interfering RNA), SPTLC2-NC (SPTLC2
  plasmid negative control), and SPTLC2 (SPTLC2 plasmid), the protein expression of
  SPTLC2 was detected by western blotting assay (a), and the proliferation (b), migration
  (c), invasion (d), and S1P production (e) were measured. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus
  the blank group.
