caption: 'Selected metabolites that significantly changed and the enrichment analysis
  among groups. (A) OPLS-DA score plots of metabolomics were obtained by GC/MS, from
  left to right: the comparison of F and C, A and C, F and A, also, F and A and C.
  All individuals were separated as clusters that conforming the experimental deign.
  (B) Volcano plots showed the relationship between log2 (Fold Change) and -log10
  (p.value). (C) Several metabolites with beneficial effects markedly increased in
  F group. (D) Relative concentration of amines between F and A groups that showed
  differences. (E) The top 25 KEGG metabolic pathways with differences between F and
  C groups, F and A groups. The bottom scale showed the enrichment ratio of each pathway
  and the color depth of each bar indicated the degree of the difference. C: control
  group, F: FAM group, A: antibiotic group. ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, blank represents
  no significant differences.'
