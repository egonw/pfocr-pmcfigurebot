caption: Upregulation of CircPVT1 induces cell viability, invasion and migration in
  gastric cancer. (A) RT-PCR examined the CircPVT1 expression patterns in AGS, SGC-7901
  and GES-1 cells. (B–C) Both GC cell lines were transfected with si-CircPVT1 or pc-CircPVT1.
  NC, negative control, was the cell group without transfection. RT-PCR quantified
  the relative expression of CircPVT1 in each group. (D–E) Cell viability in all groups
  were evaluated using CCK8 method. (F–I) Transwell experiments were conducted to
  detect the cell migration and invasiveness in response to the alteration of CircPVT1
  expression in GC cell lines. All experiments were repeated thrice. Mean and standard
  deviation (sd) values were shown in the subfigures. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001, compared to
  the GES-1 group(A), NC groups (B–I).
