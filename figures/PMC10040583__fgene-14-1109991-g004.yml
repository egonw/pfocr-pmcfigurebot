caption: Genes and proteins co-interacted with C1QC show a relevance to immune-related
  signaling pathway. (A) KEGG and GO analysis results of genes co-expressed with C1QC
  in KIRC. (B) p-value colored network of enriched terms; p values for terms that
  have a larger number of genes are usually smaller. (C) Cluster ID-colored network
  of enriched terms; nodes sharing the same cluster ID usually approach to each other.
  (D) C1QC-proteins interaction. (Eâ€“G) Association analysis of C1QC with CSF1R, VSIG4,
  and C3AR1 in different ethnic groups.
