caption: TRAF7 inhibits RLR-mediated innate immunity. A TRAF7 inhibits the activation
  of the IFN-β promoter and ISRE. HEK 293 ​cells (1 ​× ​105) were transfected with
  TRAF7 plasmids, pRL-TK (0.025 ​μg), and IFN-β promoter (0.025 ​μg) or ISRE (0.025 ​μg).
  After 12 ​h, the cells were treated with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for 12 ​h or left untreated
  before luciferase analysis. B TRAF7 impairs the transcript levels of downstream
  antiviral genes and enhances the viral replication ability. HEK 293 ​cells (2 ​× ​105)
  were transfected with an empty vector or TRAF7. Cells were treated or untreated
  with SeV for 12 ​h before qPCR analysis. C TRAF7 enhances the replication of VSV,
  HEK 293 ​cells were transfected with an empty vector or TRAF7 and infected with
  VSV (MOI ​= ​0.2) for 16 ​h before collecting the supernatants to infect Vero cells.
  D TRAF7 reduces the production of IFN-β protein. ELISA of IFN-β in HEK 293 ​cells
  transfected for 12 ​h with TRAF7, followed by infection for 12 ​h with SeV. E TRAF7
  damages the dimerization of IRF3. HEK 293 ​cells (2 ​× ​105) were transfected with
  an empty vector or TRAF7. After 12 ​h, the cells were treated or untreated with
  SeV for 12 ​h before immunoblotting analysis. F TRAF7 inhibits the nuclear translocation
  of IRF3. HEK 293 ​cells (2 ​× ​106) were transfected with empty vector or TRAF7
  plasmids; cells were infected with SeV 0 or 12 ​h before immunoblot analysis of
  IRF3 in cytoplasmic (Cyt) and nuclear (Nuc) fractions. (∗∗P ​< ​0.01).
