caption: Knockdown of PTEN significantly reversed the influence of miR-424 inhibitor
  on cell apoptosis, cell stage, and EMT process. (A) Cell apoptosis was measured
  with flow cytometry; (B) The cell cycle change was measured with flow cytometry;
  (C) The protein levels of EMT proteins were detected with western blotting. * means
  p <0.05. The experiment was performed 3 times.
