caption: 'The expression of MED16 is associated with breast cancer tumorigenesis.
  (A,B) Gene expression data of MED16 in breast cancer and normal tissues from the
  TCGA and GEO databases showed that MED16 mRNA level was overexpressed in human breast
  cancer (C) RT-PCR was adopted to detect the mRNA expression level of MED16 in tumour
  and adjacent tissues (n = 25). (The values are compared to normal group and are
  represented as the means ± S.E.M (ns: not significant, ** p < 0.01). (D) MED16 expression
  in breast cancer subtypes from the TCGA cohort. (E,F) Western blot and RT-qPCR were
  used to detect the MED16 expression in different subtype BC cell lines. (G) IHC
  staining of MED16 expression in normal and ER+ BC tissues (the bar on the figure
  represents 50 µm), mostly located in the cytoplasm.'
