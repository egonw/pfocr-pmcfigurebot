caption: 'Methodological approaches to probe reticulospinal tract in humans. A: StartReact
  paradigm involves quantifying the reaction time measured in electromyographic activity
  of muscle in response to a visual cue (visual reaction time, VRT; blue upward arrow),
  which can be additionally preceded by an auditory stimulus. The startling auditory
  stimulus (>110 dB) is thought to preactivate reticular pathways resulting in the
  greater shortening of the reaction time (visual-startling reaction time, VSRT; orange
  upward arrow) compared with auditory facilitation (80 dB; visual-auditory reaction
  time, VART; violet upward arrow). Reticulospinal gain is then quantified as the
  ratio of the difference between VRT and VSRT and between VRT and VART (). It is
  hypothesized that the reticulospinal gain would increase with resistance training.
  Traces are from the personal archive of E. Atkinson (unpublished data) and show
  an average of 20 responses of the quadriceps femoris muscle. B: when a startling
  auditory stimulus precedes transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) of the motor
  cortex by 80 ms, the responses (motor-evoked potentials, MEPs) are facilitated compared
  with when TES is delivered alone (test MEP). The facilitated response is thought
  to reflect facilitated subcortical structures, likely mediated via the reticulospinal
  tract (, ). It is hypothesized that resistance training would augment facilitation
  of MEP response to a startling auditory stimulus. Traces are from the personal archive
  of E. Atkinson (unpublished data) and show an average of five responses of the first
  dorsal interosseus muscle. C: ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (iMEPs) in response
  to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex are thought to represent
  activation of the reticulospinal tract through the corticoreticulospinal pathway
  (). Note the difference in latency between MEPs and iMEPs (âˆ¼10.5 vs. 16.5 ms). It
  remains unknown whether the startling auditory stimulus would cause a similar facilitation
  of iMEP that is observed with responses to TES. It is hypothesized that iMEPs would
  increase following a period of resistance training. Traces are from the personal
  archive of E. Atkinson (unpublished data) and show an average of four responses
  of the biceps brachii muscle. The data collected for the unpublished traces were
  from members of the research team during pilot testing in the labs who gave written
  informed consent. The study was approved by the Northumbria University Faculty of
  Health and Life Sciences ethics committee (Submission ID: 21321). Created with BioRender.com
