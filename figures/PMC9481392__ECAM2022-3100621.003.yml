caption: 'KL gene deceases FGF23 expression. (a) Expression of KL, FGF23, and APP
  in hippocampus of rats was detected using Western blot (n = 3). The semiquantitative
  analysis of protein KL (b), FGF23 (c), and APP (d) was employed based on β-actin.
  (E) KL gene expression in hippocampus of rats (n = 3). One-way ANOVA assay was used
  to for pairwise comparison. ##P < 0.01, compared with control.'
