caption: NcRNA-encoded peptides/proteins regulated signal transduction. (a) β-Catenin-370aa
  and AXIN1-295aa competitively bound to component(GSK-3β, APC) in destruction complex
  to activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promoting proliferation and metastasis in HCC
  and GC. (b) CIP2A-BP competitively bound to CIP2A, prohibiting p-AKT and TNBC metastasis;
  HER2-103 induced EGFR/HER3 homo/heterodimer formation and downregulated PI3K/AKT
  activation, promoting proliferation and invasion in TNBC; AKT3-174aa combine with
  PDK1 to stimulate p-AKT activation, prohibiting proliferation in GBM. (c) MAPK1-109aa
  and SMIM30 interacted with MEK1, SRC/YES1 to regulate MAPK signaling, influencing
  proliferation and metastasis in GC and HCC; ASK1-272aa competitively boundto AKT1
  to activate ASK1/JNK/p38 signaling, promoting apoptosis in LAUD.
