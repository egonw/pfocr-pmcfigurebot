caption: 'Fit of DAMGO and morphine induced μ-opioid receptor (MOPr) responses along
  two different pathways involving G-protein activation and β-arrestin2 recruitment,
  respectively as obtained in three different works by three different groups: (A)
  McPherson et al. at the University of Bristol (), (B) Hothersall et al. at Pfizer
  (), and (C) Pedersen et al. at the University of Copenhagen (). Data and fit for
  DAMGO (C1) and morphine (C2) shown in blue and purple, respectively with G-protein
  activation (R1) in darker and β-arrestin recruitment responses (R2) in lighter shades.
  Top row: fit with classic sigmoid concentration-response curves and corresponding
  binding affinity (K d) and pharmacodynamic (EC50, E max) parameters as obtained
  in these works (with calculated occupancy curves shown as dashed lines). Middle
  row: fit of the same data with SABRE using only four parameters for each dataset–two
  pathway amplifications (γ) and two ligand efficacies (ε). Bottom row: corresponding
  response versus occupancy graphs; the stronger the curvature here compared to the
  straight unity line of linear response, the more the left- or right-shift in the
  concentration-response curve as compared to the occupancy one.'
article_title: 'Quantitative receptor model for responses that are left- or right-shifted
  versus occupancy (are more or less concentration sensitive): the SABRE approach.'
