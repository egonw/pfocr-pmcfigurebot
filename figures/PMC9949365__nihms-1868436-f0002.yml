figure_title: Selinexor Activates PI3K/AKT Signaling in AML cells
caption: 'a) Immunoblot depicting protein levels of phosphorylated and total PI3K/AKT
  pathway members following treatment of a panel of AML cell lines with selinexor.
  Selinexor was dosed at the following concentrations for each cell line: OCI-AML2
  (200nM), MOLM-13 (75nM), MV;411 (50nM), HL-60 (300nM), OCI-AML3 (250nM).b) Immunoblot
  depicting protein levels of phosphorylated AKT at T308 and S473 in OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3,
  and MOLM-13 cells treated with Selinexor for indicated duration.c) Immunoblot depicting
  protein levels of XPO1 and total and phosphorylated AKT at T308 in OCI-AML2 cells
  with doxycycline (dox) inducible shRNAs targeting XPO1 versus scrambled shRNA control.
  Cells were exposed to dox (75ng/mL) for indicated durations prior to collection.d)
  Immunoblot depicting protein levels of XPO1, total and phosphorylated AKT at T308
  and S473 in OCI-AML2 cells with sgRNAs targeting XPO1 versus non-targeting controls.Representative
  immunoblots of n=3-5 biologically independent experiments yielding similar results.
  B-actin included as loading control.'
