figure_title: 'Identification of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-cystathionine gamma-lyase
  (Cse) signaling pathway responsible for inducing neurovascular regeneration under
  diabetic conditions. (A) Cytokine antibody analysis of conditioned medium from MCECs
  treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Hsp70 protein (500 ng/mL) under
  normal-glucose (NG) or high-glucose (HG) conditions in the presence of scrambled
  shRNA control (shCon; 1×104 TU/mL culture medium) or Cse-knockdown shRNA (shCse;
  1×104 TU/mL culture medium) for 5 days. The relative expression of each cytokine
  was determined by comparing the respective plots to the positive control (reference
  spot). The frame line indicates positive signals for SDF1 in the Hsp70-Cse signaling
  pathway. (B) Representative western blots for SDF1, HO-1, p-PI3K/total PI3K, p-Akt/total
  Akt, p-eNOS/total eNOS, and p-NF-κB/total NF-κB in vivo and in vitro. Left (in vivo):
  Mouse penis tissue from age-matched control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic
  mice at 2 weeks after repeated (days 3 and 0;) intracavernous injections of PBS
  (20 µL) or Hsp70 protein (5 µg/20 µL) in the presence of shCon (5×104 TU/mouse)
  or shCse (5×104 TU/mouse). Right (in vitro): MCECs treated with PBS or Hsp70 protein
  (500 ng/mL) under NG or HG conditions in the presence of shCon (1×104 TU/mL culture
  medium) or shCse (1×104 TU/mL culture medium). (C-N) Expression of the indicated
  proteins was quantified by assessing the density of the corresponding protein bands
  using Image J; results are presented as mean±SEM (n=4; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001;
  Student’s t-test). Relative ratios in control and NG groups were set to 1. DM: diabetes
  mellitus, ns: not significant, C: control, P: PBS, H: Hsp70'
