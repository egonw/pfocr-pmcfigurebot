figure_title: Drugs targeting the different steps in the flavivirus life cycle

  that inhibit the different steps of the virus lifecycle discussed in this review
  are indicated in the red boxes. Flaviviruses consist of 3 structural proteins (C,
  prM or M, and E) and 7 NS proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5),
  each playing distinctive roles in the different stages of the flavivirus life cycle
  and modulation of innate immune responses. During the virus replication cycle, the
  viral proteins interact with numerous host factors to modulate cellular pathways
  and induce infection. The flavivirus life cycle is outlined in . (1) The E glycoprotein
  of the mature virion binds to the host cell membrane receptors and enters host cells
  via clathrin-mediated endocytosis []. (2) The acidic environment of the endosome
  triggers major structural changes in the E glycoprotein, inducing fusion of the
  host endosomal membrane with the viral E protein []. This is followed by the uncoating
  of the NC and the releasing of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. (3) The
  positive-sense viral genome (+ssRNA) is translated by ribosomes to form the viral
  polyprotein, which is then cleaved into structural and NS proteins by viral serine
  protease (NS2B-NS3) and hostâ€“cells peptidases/signalases in the ER []. (4) The NS
  proteins associate with intracellular membranes located on the surface of the ER
  to form viral replication complexes. The NS5 protein-derived RdRp synthesizes a
  complementary minus-strand RNA from genomic RNA for the synthesis of new positive-strand
  viral RNA []. (5) The newly synthesized viral RNA will then associate with the C
  protein in the ER to form a NC, leading to the formation of immature virions [].
  (6) Maturation and exocytosis. The assembled immature, noninfectious virion will
  then bud off the ER and travels through the secretory pathway to the TGN, where
  furin-mediated proteolysis occurs. Then, the mature virions are released from the
  cell surface via exocytosis []. C, capsid; E, envelope; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  M, membrane; NC, nucleocapsid; NS, nonstructural; prM, premembrane; RdRp, RNA-dependent
  RNA polymerase; TGN, trans-Golgi network.
