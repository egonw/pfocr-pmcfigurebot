caption: 'Kub3 deletion results in abnormal lung morphogenesis. (A) Gross morphology
  of embryos at different stages. WT, HT and KO embryos of different development stages
  (E12.5, E15.5, E18.5) were dissected and photos were taken. Scale bar: 0.2 cm. (B)
  Morphological structure of E18.5 embryos examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
  staining. Images of lung tissues are enlarged in the bottom panel. Scale bar: 0.1
  cm in upper panel; 200 Âµm in bottom panel. (C) Gross morphology of embryonic lungs
  at E18.5. Lungs were dissected from E18.5 embryos and photos were taken. Scale bar:
  0.2 cm. (D) qRT-PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of Kub3 in different tissues of
  WT embryos at E18.5. GAPDH is the internal control (n = 3). (E) Kub3 protein level
  in different tissues in WT E18.5 embryos by Western blot analysis. Total protein
  lysates were isolated from different tissues of WT E18.5 embryos. Western blot was
  performed with an antibody against Kub3. GAPDH is the internal control. The ratios
  to GAPDH expression are represented by the graph (n = 3).'
