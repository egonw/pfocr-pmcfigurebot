figure_title: Epithelial-FIB communication modules in human BCC
caption: (A) Heatmap of active signaling pathways in epithelial-FIB cross-talk from
  human PTS and BCC samples. Blue, active signaling pathway; red, inactive signaling
  pathway. (B) Ranking of active signaling pathways in PTS and BCC based on their
  overall information flow within the inferred cellular networks. Signaling pathways
  are colored according to condition where they are enriched, whereas those in black
  are enriched equally across conditions. (C) Joint clustering of active signaling
  pathways from PTS and BCC into a shared two-dimensional manifold according to their
  functional signaling relationship similarity (k = 4). Circles represent PTS signaling
  pathways; squares represent BCC signaling pathways. Each shape represents the communication
  network of one signaling pathway. A magnified view of each cluster with labeled
  active signaling pathways is shown on the right. (D) Circle plots show ncWNT signaling
  in sending and receiving cells. Nodes are colored similarly as senders. Size of
  cell clusters is representative of the number of active cells in signaling network.
  ncWNT is active in BCC but not in PTS. Cell types participating in signaling pathway
  network are labeled. Bar graphs show relative contribution of specific ligand-receptor
  pairs for ncWNT signaling in BCC. WNT5A ligand is the only active ligand in the
  ncWNT signaling network. (E) Dot plots show cross-talk probability between FIBs
  (senders) and epithelial cells (receivers) via ncWNT signaling. Blue, low cross-talk
  probability; red, high cross-talk probability. Size of circle represents the percentage
  of cells with high cross-talk probability. Ligands are colored aqua blue; receptors
  are colored magenta. (F to I) Circle plots and network centrality analysis for CXCL
  (F), IL6 (G), IFN-I (H), and TNF (I) signaling. Only cell clusters participating
  in signaling network are labeled. Inactive pathway indicates that the pathway is
  not active. Heatmaps represent network centrality. White, low importance; green,
  high importance.
