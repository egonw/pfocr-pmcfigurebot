caption: 'Electric shock pathway activation can be replaced by either dopamine perfusion
  or activation of dopaminergic neurons. A, Schematic of the dissected adult CNS showing
  the placement of one electrode to activate the AFV. B, Representative images showing
  the simultaneous expression of UAS-GRAB DA2m (left; green) and UAS-jRCaMP1a (right;
  red) in the same neurons in the MB (driven by VT030559-GAL4). Scale bar, 25 µm.
  C, Time course of GRAB DA2m responses in the α′3 and α3 compartments on AFV stimulation
  (green) or no stimulus (gray). Traces represent mean ΔF/F ± SEM across the 6 flies
  tested. In each compartment, a representative jRCaMP1a response is shown (red) as
  a reference for neural activity on AFV stimulation. D, Quantification of the GRAB
  DA2m responses in C. Two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05; n = 6 in each condition): lobe effects,
  F(1,20) = 3.759, p = 0.0668; stimulation effects, F(1,20) = 29.52, p < 0.0001. Sidak
  post hoc tests: in the α′3 compartment, ****t(20) = 5.411, p < 0.0001; in the α3
  compartment, nst(20) = 2.273, p = 0.0673. E, Schematic of the AL+DA induction protocol,
  showing electrode placement above the AL, and perfusion of dopamine. F, Paired and
  unpaired induction protocols. Top, In the paired induction, the ipsilateral AL is
  activated by 5 stimulation trains with 15 s intertrain interval followed by resting
  for 1 min (pre-induction). Twelve trains of stimulations are then applied via the
  AL electrode, coincident with 60 s of dopamine perfusion. The brain is then rested
  for 15 min before being tested by 5 trains of AL stimulations like those applied
  during the pre-induction (post-induction). Bottom, The unpaired induction: same
  as paired induction, except that the AL stimulation and dopamine perfusion are separated
  by 30 s during the induction stage. The stimulation train is 20 pulses at 100 Hz;
  each pulse is 1 ms with 9 ms interpulse interval. AL stimulation strength: 100 µAmps.
  G, Mean relative change of the calcium responses in the α′3 (left) and the α3 (right)
  compartments after DA perfusion alone (gray), unpaired AL+DA induction (green),
  and paired AL+DA induction (blue). Three different DA concentrations were used:
  1 μm (left), 5 μm (middle), and 10 μm (right). Data are mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA:
  lobe effects, F(1,68) = 2.724, p = 0.1034; induction effects, F(8,68) = 9.584, p
  < 0.0001. Tukey''s post hoc results are listed in . H, Mean relative change of the
  calcium responses in the α′3 (left) and the α3 (right) compartments before induction
  and 30 or 60 min after paired AL+ 10 μm DA induction (blue). Data are mean ± SEM.
  Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (α = 0.05; n = 4 in each condition): lobe effects,
  F(1,6) = 12.67, p = 0.0119; time effects, F(1.341,8.045) = 2.249, p = 0.1719; lobe
  × time interaction effects, F(2,12) = 5.206, p = 0.0236. Sidak post hoc tests: in
  the α′3 compartment: A versus A, p > 0.05; B versus A, p ≤ 0.05; t(3) = {6.216,
  p = 0.025; 11.64, p = 0.0041; 1.03, p = 0.7604} for {pre vs 30 min; pre vs 60 min;
  30 min vs 60 min}, respectively. No statistical significance across conditions in
  the α3 compartment, p > 0.05; t(3) = {0.7799, p = 0.8692; 0.4625, p = 0.9657; 0.1993,
  p = 0.9969} for {pre vs 30 min; pre vs 60 min; 30 min vs 60 min}, respectively.
  I, Schematic of the AL+PPL1 induction protocol, showing electrode placement above
  the AL, and perfusion of 2.5 mm ATP to activate the P2X2 channels expressed in the
  PPL1 dopaminergic neurons (driven by TH-LexA). J, Paired and unpaired induction
  protocols. Top, In the paired induction, the ipsilateral AL is activated by 5 stimulation
  trains with 15 s intertrain interval followed by resting for 1 min (pre-induction).
  We then apply 12 trains of stimulations to the AL electrode, coincident with 60
  s of 2.5 mm ATP perfusion. The brain is then rested for 15 min before being tested
  by 5 trains of AL stimulations like those applied during the pre-induction (post-induction).
  Bottom, The unpaired induction: same as paired induction, except that the AL stimulation
  and ATP perfusion are separated by 30 s during the induction stage. The stimulation
  train is 20 pulses at 100 Hz; each pulse is 1 ms with 9 ms interpulse interval.
  AL stimulation strength: 100 µAmps. K, Mean relative change of the calcium responses
  in the α′3 (left) and the α3 (right) compartments after unpaired AL+ATP induction
  (green), and paired AL+ATP induction (blue). Data are mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA
  (α = 0.05; n = 8 in each condition): lobe effects, F(1,28) = 9.053, p = 0.0055;
  induction effects, F(1,28) = 8.284, p = 0.0076. Sidak post hoc tests: in the α′3
  compartment, **t(28) = 3.446, p < 0.0036; In the α3 compartment, nst(28) = 0.624,
  p = 0.7862.'
