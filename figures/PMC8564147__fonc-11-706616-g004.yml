caption: Pathway analysis of immune-related lncRNA model. (A, B) Gene ontology analysis
  was used to explore the potential functional mechanism of immune-related lncRNA
  model, and the results are visualized in the low-risk group (A) and high-risk group
  (B). Immune-related lncRNA signaling pathway obtained by gene set enrichment analysis,
  including T cell receptor signaling pathway (C), Fc epsilon RI pathway (D), p53
  signaling pathway (E), and cell cycle (F).
