caption: Young ER-α+ breast tumor stroma exhibits significant differences in specific
  matrix components and immune cell types. Young tumor stroma (<45 years old) revealed
  significantly higher levels of matrix components (fibronectin, integrin α and β,
  collagen III, collagen V, collagen VI, collagen VII, and laminins A, B, and C) and
  immune cell types (CD8+ T cells and TH2 cells) (*P < 0.05). Aged tumor stroma (>65
  years old) revealed a significantly higher M2 macrophage infiltrate (*P < 0.05)
  compared to young stroma. The young and aged tumor stroma exhibit comparable numbers
  for MSC and adipocyte infiltrate; however, young MSCs may exhibit a greater potency
  and stimulate a rapid estrogen signaling pathway through cytokine and growth factor
  secretions. The activation of ER-α through ser-167 phosphorylation by another signaling
  pathway may be an underlying factor for the increased ER-α signaling and increased
  proliferation observed in MCF-7 cells stimulated with young CM compared to those
  stimulated with aged CM. Created with Biorender.com
