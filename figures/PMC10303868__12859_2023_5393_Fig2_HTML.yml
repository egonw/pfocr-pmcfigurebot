caption: Overall survival curves of immunotherapy treated skin cancer patients. Overall
  survival curves of immunotherapy treated skin cancer patients dichotomized based
  on perforin 1 (PRF1) (A) and HLA-DPA1 (B). User interface of the gene-level survival
  analysis of PRF1. Samples were filtered based on pre-treatment (2 and 3). PF1 was
  searched and selected from the Single-gene list (4, 5, 6). Kaplan meier curve is
  shown comparing a median dichotemized patient population (7)
