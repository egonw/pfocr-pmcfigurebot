caption: 'G3BP1 promoted cell proliferation and increased metastasis in vivo. (A and
  B) The roles of G3BP1 on cell growth in vivo were verified by tumorigenesis assay
  in nude mice. (C) Representative image of H&E staining of xenograft model, and the
  necrosis area were drawn. (D) Representative image of IHC staining of xenograft
  model. (E and F) Mice model was constructed to verify the oncogenic roles of G3BP1
  and JAK2, moreover, JAK2 could rescue the slackening growth induced by knocking-down
  of G3BP1. Note: (1) siNC+Vector, (2) siG3BP1+Vector, (3) siNC+JAK2, (4) siG3BP1+
  JAK2. (G) Representative image of IHC staining of xenograft model. (H) The effects
  of G3BP1 on the metastasis in vivo were confirmed by tail vein metastasis model,
  and stattic was injected for rescue assay. (I) The number of metastatic nudes in
  lungs under microscope. Note: (1) Control+DMSO, (2) G3BP1+DMSO, (3) G3BP1+Stattic.
  (J) Representative image of H&E staining of metastatic nudes, and arrows indicated
  metastatic tumors.'
