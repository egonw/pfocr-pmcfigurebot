caption: 'Supplementation with 2-DG reduces cachexic muscle atrophy by blocking USP
  and ALP pathway activation in C26 conditioned medium-treated C2C12 myotubes. (A)
  Western blot analysis was used to evaluate atrogin-1, MuRF-1, MHC, p-STAT3, and
  STAT3 expression in three groups between two cachexia cell lines models. (B) Myosin
  heavy-chain (MHC) expression in the cell model was evaluated by immunofluorescence
  staining. Scale bar: 50 µM. MHC, green; Hoechst, blue. The bar graph shows the mean
  gray value of different groups. (C) Western blot analysis was used to evaluate atrogin-1,
  MuRF-1, p-STAT3, STAT3, p62, LC3, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase3 expression
  in the cell model of the four groups. Cells were treated with 5 mM 2-DG, 20 µM cisplatin,
  or 25 µM chloroquine for 24 h. (D) LC3 expression in the cell model was evaluated
  by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar: 50 µM. LC3, green; Hoechst, blue. The
  bar graph shows the mean gray value of different groups. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with NC groups; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01
  compared with C26 CM group or TNFα/IFNγ group, n = 10.'
