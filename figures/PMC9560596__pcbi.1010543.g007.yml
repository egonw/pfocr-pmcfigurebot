figure_title: Possible synaptic top-down control of working memory representations
  via the tripartite synapse
caption: 'A Deep cortical layers could drive oscillation in superficial layers, which
  represent specific working memories []. LPA signaling suggests two possible indirect
  pathways for such a control mechanism: Incoming activity from deep layers may contribute
  to PRG1 inhibition through heterosynaptic effects (left), or astrocytic signaling
  may increase LPA synthesis through astrocytic ATX, therefore modulating STP in recurrent
  connections (right). B Details of the heterosynaptic and astrocytic signaling pathway
  shown with magenta arrow and green shaded astrocytic cell, respectively.'
