caption: miR-9-5p inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. (A-B) The mineralization
  of hBMSCs transfected with miR-9-5p mimic and miR-9-5p inhibitor (anti-miR-9-5p)
  was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and ALP activity. (C-F) The osteogenesis-related
  gene expression (including ALP, OPN and OCN) of hBMSCs transfected with miR-9-5p
  mimic and miR-9-5p inhibitor (anti-miR-9-5p) was measured by qRT-PCR (C-D) and western
  blot (E-F) assays. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs miR-control.
