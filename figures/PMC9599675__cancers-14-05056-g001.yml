caption: Overview of the endocytic pathways. Phagocytosis incorporates extracellular
  components through phagocytic receptors. Cells that phagocytose with high efficiency
  are termed professional cells, whereas those with low efficiency are termed non-professional
  cells. Pinocytosis nonspecifically incorporates soluble components, such as proteins
  and growth factors. Small vesicles are formed through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated
  pathways during pinocytosis. The pathway of extensive incorporation, with membrane
  protrusion from the cell surface, is termed macropinocytosis. The endometrial cancer
  cell Sawano exhibits macropinocytosis caused by a transient split of intercellular
  spaces.
