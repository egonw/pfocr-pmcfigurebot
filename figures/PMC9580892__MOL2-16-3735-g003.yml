caption: 'Co‐exposure to ABT‐199 and Apatinib induces apoptosis of DLBCL cells, in
  association with altered cell cycle distribution, increased ROS generation, and
  mitochondrial injury. (A, B) Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of ABT‐199 ± Apatinib for 12 and 24 h, after which the percentage of Annexin‐V+
  apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry after Annexin‐V and PI double staining.
  The CI was calculated based on apoptosis using the calcusyn software to evaluate
  the interaction between ABT‐199 and Apatinib in DLBCL cell lines (CI < 1.0 = 1.0,
  and > 1.0, indicating synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effect, respectively).
  (C) Cell cycle distribution was assessed at 24 h by flow cytometry (black, dark
  purple, black‐purple, and lavender present the statistical significance of Sub‐G0,
  G0/G1, S, G2/M between DMSO and Combo group, respectively). (D) Cell lysates after
  treatment with ABT‐199 and Apatinib alone or a combination were collected, and levels
  of cell cycle‐related proteins P21, P27, CyclinA2, and CyclinD1 were determined
  by western blotting with the respective antibodies. (E, F) OCI‐Ly1 and OCI‐Ly19
  cells with loss of MMP (scale bar: 100 μm). (G, H) Meanwhile, intracellular ROS
  levels were measured by flow cytometry using the Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit.
  (I) OCI‐Ly1 and OCI‐Ly19 cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of ABT‐199 ± Apatinib
  for 24 h, after which western blot analysis was shown to monitor the expression
  of p‐VEGFR‐2, MAPK pathway associated proteins, antiapoptotic proteins BCL‐2 and
  MCL‐1, as well as cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student''s t tests. All experiments
  were repeated three times (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.'
