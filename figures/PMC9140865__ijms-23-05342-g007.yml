caption: Schematic model of DNA damage induced by higher pressure in hepatocytes.
  Higher stress results in aggravated DNA damage in hepatocytes. Higher pressure activates
  ERK1/2 and upregulates the expression level of Dicer. Then, Dicer mediates the DDR
  of the cell. After Dicer expression downregulation, the DDR function of the cells
  is diminished, and the DNA damage of the cells is enhanced in response to stress.
