caption: APLN reduced cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation of esophageal
  cancer cells. TE-1 and ECA-109 cells were transfected with APLN siRNA without or
  with pcDNA-APLN to knockdown APLN or rescue APLN. Cells were stained with FITC-Annexin
  V and collected by flow cytometry. Representative images of flow cytometry were
  shown (A) and quantitative (B). Cell proliferation was shown (C); *p<0.05 compared
  to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
