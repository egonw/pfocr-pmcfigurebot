caption: Canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways of Wnts. In absence of Wnt,
  β-catenin associates with APC, Axin, CK1 and GSK-3β to form the complex of destruction
  box. CK1 phosphorylates Ser45 in β-catenin, a priming step, and GSK-3β subsequently
  phosphorylates Ser41, Ser37 and Ser33 in β-catenin, leading to polyubiquitylation
  by β-TrCP, E3 ubiquitin ligase, and degradation. In the canonical pathway, Wnt3a
  stimulates the receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6, which recruit Axin and GSK-3β, thereby
  resulting in dissociation of the destruction box and consequent β-catenin accumulation.
  In the non-canonical pathway, Wnt5a stimulates the receptors Frizzled and ROR1/2,
  which induce the activation of Rho subfamily GTPases including RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1.
  The Rho GTPases are involved in PCP processes with cell migration. In addition,
  the non-canonical signaling induces PLC activation and Ca2+ mobilization. In particular,
  in the canonical pathway, Wnt3a activates RhoA and induces Tyr42 phosphorylation
  of RhoA by Src. Of note, β-catenin forms a complex with p-Tyr42 RhoA, translocates
  to the nucleus, where the complex regulates the expression of specific genes such
  as vimentin.
