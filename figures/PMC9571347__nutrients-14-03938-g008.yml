caption: 'GS activated the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. (A,B) Levels
  of TG, TC, GSH, and SOD in cell extracts. (C) Immunofluorescent analysis of neutral
  lipids accumulation (fat droplets) in HepG2 cells using BODIPY stain. (D) The production
  of ROS in HepG2 cells was assessed by DCHF-DA assay. (E,F) After the addition of
  sh-SIRT1 or doxorubicin hydrochloride (DH, AMPK inhibitor) the role of GS on SIRT1,
  p-AMPK, AMPK, and Nrf2 levels was tested by Western blot. Significantly different
  from control, * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01, or ANIT, # p < 0.05 or ## p < 0.01, or
  ANIT+GS-H, & p < 0.05 or && p < 0.01.'
