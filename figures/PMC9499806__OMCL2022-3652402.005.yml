caption: 'Isorhamnetin exerted neuroprotective effects by modulating the TYK2/STAT1
  pathway. (a) Experimental design scheme. (b–g) Western blotting revealed the modulation
  of TYK2/STAT1 signaling and cleaved caspase 3 in the neurons treated with IL-6 (350 pg/mL)
  and/or isorhamnetin (10 μM) or HMC3-conditioned medium and/or isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin
  impeded the activities of the apoptotic and TYK2/STAT1 pathway. Data were analyzed
  using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni''s post hoc test (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 (control vs IL-6; control vs IL-6/ISN and control vs HMC3 C.M; control
  vs HMC3 C.M/ISN); #P < 0.05 (IL-6 vs IL-6/ISN and HMC3 C.M vs HMC3 C.M/ISN), n =
  3; means ± SEM). HMC3 C.M: HMC3-conditional medium; ISN: isorhamnetin.'
