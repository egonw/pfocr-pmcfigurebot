caption: 'Gene expression profile based on microarray experiments. Variations in gene
  expression between the variants (specific lichen secondary metabolites with/or TMZ)
  vs. control are shown as scatter plots (A). The x and y values on the scatter plots
  are the normalized signal values, shown in a log2 scale. The black dotted lines
  were set as fold change cut-off value (FC) = 2 and −2. Bubble plot of differentially
  expressed genes from each group assigned to gene ontology (DAVID GO-BP DIRECT) terms
  where the red color represents GO terms whose genes are downregulated while green
  corresponds to GO terms of upregulated genes (B). Circos plots show the interdependence
  between selected GO terms and their genes. Symbols of DEGs are presented on the
  left side of the graph, where their fold-change values were mapped by color scale
  (green indicates higher expression, red indicates lower expression, and grey indicates
  expression levels below the cut-off value). This area was further subdivided into
  compartments corresponding to the regulation of the expression of the given gene
  in the relevant study groups. It represents the following comparisons from the outer
  side of the graph: TMZ vs. control, Atranorin + TMZ vs. control, Caperatic acid
  + TMZ vs. control, Physodic acid + TMZ vs. control, Squamatic acid + TMZ vs. control,
  Salazinic acid + TMZ vs. control, Lecanoric acid + TMZ vs. control (C). Kyoto Encyclopedia
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes. The
  significant pathways (e.g., Wnt signaling pathway) of regulated genes are demonstrated.
  Differentially expressed genes belonging to these pathways were assigned to a predetermined
  color scale which was subsequently imposed on the gene/protein symbol field. The
  whole area of the gene was divided into subareas marked with a number above, where:
  1—TMZ vs. control, 2—Atranorin + TMZ vs. control, 3—Caperatic acid + TMZ vs. control,
  4—Physodic acid + TMZ vs. control, 5—Squamatic acid + TMZ vs. control, 6—Salazinic
  acid + TMZ vs. control, 7—Lecanoric acid + TMZ vs. control (D).'
