caption: Gene expression is altered in PCOS women's granulosa cumulus cells (GCs)
  compared to normoresponder controls (CONT). (a) The heat map illustration shows
  differentially expressed genes in CONT and PCOS in GCs. The colour spectrum ranging
  from red to blue indicates normalized levels of gene expression from high to low.
  (b) Volcano plots for RNA-seq comparing CONT and PCOS. Red spots on the left upper
  box represent –log10 (P-value) ≥2; red spots on the right upper box represent the
  –log10 (P-value) <2. (c) Selected differentially expressed genes in CONT and PCOS,
  P < 0.05 for each. The transcripts per million (TPM) value represents the relative
  expression level comparable between samples. For the box plots, the bottom and top
  whiskers denote 5 and 95 percentile values, the bottom and top bounds of the rectangle
  denote the 25 and 75 percentile values, and the line in between denotes the median
  (50 percentile) value of the distribution. (d) Pathway analysis was evaluated using
  the Gene Ontology bioinformatics tool in GCs. Log2 fold change (FC) ≥0.584 false
  discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05.
