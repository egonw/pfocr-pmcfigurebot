caption: DNA-PK is critical for integrin α6β4 signaling-mediated cisplatin sensitivity.
  (A-C) BT549 cells (EV and β4) were treated with vehicle (Control), 1µM cisplatin
  and/or DNA-PK inhibitor (0.1 µM NU7441 or 1µM NU7026, as noted) for 6 days. The
  phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs S2056 was assessed by immunoblotting, quantified, and
  reported as relative changes to BT549-EV control (A). (D) MDA-MB-231 cells and the
  integrin β4 knock out cells with one of two distinct gRNAs (clones 454-1 and 661-5)
  were treated with vehicle (Control), 1µM cisplatin and/or 1µM NU7026 as noted for
  6 days. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assays for the effect of NU7441 (B) and
  NU7026 (C, D) for indicated cells. Data are representative of at least 3 separate
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005. ***p < 0.0005. NS, Not Significant.
