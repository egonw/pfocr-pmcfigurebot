caption: Subcellular localization of Cdc42 and the Arp2/3 complex in response to OA
  treatment in TNBC cells. (A,D) Representative immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
  images of Cdc42 (A) and Arp2 (D) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Cells were
  treated with BSA (Ctrl) or 100 μM OA for 10 min, then stained with specific human
  Cdc42/Arp2 antibodies (green) and counterstained with DAPI (blue). The scale bar
  shown in the first image is applicable to all images within the same panel. (B,E)
  Fluorescence intensity histograms of DAPI (blue) and Cdc42 (B)/Arp2 (E) (green)
  from the lines shown in (A,D) (see merge columns). (C,F) Quantitative assessment
  of Cdc42 and Arp2 fluorescence intensities within the nucleus relative to the cytoplasmic
  region. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t-test (ns,
  not significant; **** p < 0.0001).
