caption: DAZAP1 promotes the phosphorylation of ERK in MM cells. (A) A bubble diagram
  of the top 10 KEGG pathways. In the bubble diagram, the vertical axis indicates
  the KEGG pathways and the horizontal axis represents the enrichment ratio. The sizes
  of the dots indicate the number of genes in the Gene Ontology term. (B) Active RAS
  Pull-down assay and Western blot showed the levels of active form RAS protein compared
  to total RAS protein. (C and D) WB test examined the phosphorylation level of ERK
  expression in DAZAP1-OE and siDAZAP1 MM cells.

  myeloma cell proliferation via ERK signaling pathway.
