figure_title: The TLR signalling pathway
caption: TLRs are membrane bound or endosomally bound. Membrane bound TLRs (TLR1,
  2, 6, 4 and 5) signal through MyD88 in response to a variety of stimuli, such as
  lipopeptides from gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, flagellin or lipopolysaccharide,
  and activate NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes. TLR4 can also signal through
  a MyD88 independent pathway and activate interferon (IFN) signalling. Endosomally
  bound TLRs (TLR3, 9, 7 and 8) are activated by dsRNA, ssRNA and dsDNA and activate
  IFN signalling in response to these stimuli. IRF, interferon regulatory factor;
  TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β.
