caption: Identification of activated proteins in the TGF-β signaling pathway. (a)
  Heat maps of proteins identified in the TGF-β pathway. Differentially phosphorylated
  proteins were color-coded, with red representing higher levels of protein expression
  and green suggesting lower levels. (b) Histogram showing the number of upregulated
  and downregulated proteins in the TGF-β pathway in OF, YF, OFO L-NAME, and YFO L-NAME
  animal groups. (c) Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks within the TGF-β
  pathway. The STRING Protein-Protein Interaction Network (v.11.0) program creates
  networks that show interactions between proteins identified when comparing OFO L-NAME
  to YFO L-NAME, analogous to OF versus YF. The interaction's intensity is reflected
  in the line thickness.
