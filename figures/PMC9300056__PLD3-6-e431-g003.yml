caption: Interactive viewer. (a) A screenshot of the interactive viewer. All the unfolded
  protein response (UPR) components are hotlinked so the users can obtain their information
  by clicking on each component. (b) A use case illustrating the retrieval of IRE1
  information. When users click on IRE1a or IRE1b, it will open the relevant gene
  information pages. Users can select one of the six species by clicking on the species
  name logo. It will bring weblinks for major databases.
