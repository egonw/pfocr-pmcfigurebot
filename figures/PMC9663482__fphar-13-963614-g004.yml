caption: Quercetin suppresses the EMT-like programme in glioblastoma cells. (A) Western
  blotting was used to detect the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin,
  and MMP-9) after treatment with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80μM) in U87MG and CHG-5 cell
  lines. (B) RT-qPCR analysis of the mRNA levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin,
  and MMP-9 after U87MG and CHG-5 cells were treated with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80 μM).
  All data are shown as the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 vs.
  control group. (C)Representative immunofluorescence images of the cytoskeleton (green)
  of U87MG and CHG-5 cells treated with quercetin (0, 20, 40, 80 μM). Scale bar, 20 μm.
