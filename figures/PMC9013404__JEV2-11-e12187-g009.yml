caption: Intrapulmonary delivery of immRNA using EGFR‐targeted RBCEVs suppresses breast
  cancer metastasis in the lung. (a) Schematic intrapulmonary treatments for mice
  bearing breast cancer metastasis. (b) Flow cytometry analysis of tumour burden in
  the lungs using anti‐human‐EGFR antibody after five treatments. (c) Average percentage
  of hEGFR‐positive tumour cells in the lungs as shown in (b) (n = 4 mice). (d) Average
  percentage of metastatic area in the lungs treated with 25 mg/kg uncoated, Ctrl‐VHH‐coated
  and EGFR‐VHH‐coated RBCEVs containing immRNA after five treatments (n = 4 mice).
  (e) Representative H & E stained lung sections from mice as in (d). Scale bar, 50 μm.
  (f) qPCR analysis of the RIG‐I pathway gene expression relative to Gapdh in the
  lungs of mice as in (a) (n = 4 mice). (g) Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells
  in the lungs of mice as in (a) (n = 4 mice). (h) Representative images of TUNEL
  staining (orange fluorescence) of lung sections from mice as in (a). Nuclei were
  stained with Hoechst (blue). Scale bar, 20 μm. (i) Average mean intensity per nucleus
  area of TUNEL staining signals (n = 4 mice). (j) Multiplex immunoassay of cytokines
  in the lung homogenates of mice with 4T1‐hEGFR metastatic tumours (n = 3 mice).
  All bar graphs represent mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001
