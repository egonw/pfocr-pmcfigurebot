caption: 'The low dose (1.8–3 Gy/fraction) induces the generation of ROS by hypoxia/reoxygenation
  that takes place following each exposure to radiation dose. This leads to the activation
  of HIF-1 which further generates several proangiogenic factors like VEGF or bFGF
  that debilitate radiation-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. However, inhibiting
  HIF-1 activity causes vascular radiosensitization resulting in tumour cell death.
  Exposure to a single high dose of radiation (>8–10 Gy) activates ASMase in endothelial
  cells to generate the secondary messenger ceramide. Ceramide accumulation in the
  plasma membrane facilitates apoptosis within endothelial cells, resulting in massive
  vascular disruption and subsequently leading to tumour cell death. USMB combined
  with low dose XRT elicits a similar effect as a single high dose. The addition of
  USMB to XRT is capable of activating ASMase/ceramide pathway resulting in endothelial
  cell apoptosis. This causes damage to tumour vasculature further leading to tumour
  cell death. Abbreviations: HIF-1 = hypoxia-inducible factor-1; bFGF = basic fibroblast
  growth factor; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; USMB = ultrasound-stimulated
  microbubbles; XRT = radiotherapy.'
