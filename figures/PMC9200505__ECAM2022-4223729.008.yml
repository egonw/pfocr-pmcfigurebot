caption: 'Effects of FHD on renal function and histopathology in NS rats via affecting
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (a–c) The serum levels of renal function indicators
  (SCr, BUN, and ALB) were detected using a chemical analyzer. (d) Histopathological
  changes were measured using the hematoxylin and eosin staining. Scale bar = 20 μm.
  NS model rats were induced by ADR and then treated with low-, mid-, and high-dose
  FHD or/and 740Y-P. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 compared with the control group; ##P < 0.01 and
  ###P < 0.001 compared with the model group; &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, and &&&P < 0.001
  compared with the low-FHD group; and ∆∆∆P < 0.001 compared with the FHD + 740Y-P
  group.'
