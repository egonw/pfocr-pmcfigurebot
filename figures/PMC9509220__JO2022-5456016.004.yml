caption: PDLIM1 overexpression strengthens the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin.
  (a) PDLIM1 or NC was transfected into AGS/DDP cells resistant to DDP. The profile
  of PDLIM1 was determined via RT-qPCR. (b) RT-qPCR confirmed the mRNA profile of
  PDLIM1 in the two cell lines. (c) The IC50 value to DDP in the cell lines was determined
  by CCK8. (d) The DDP-resistant cells were transfected with PDLIM1 and then treated
  with 1 μg/mL DDP. CCK8 monitored cell proliferation. The apoptosis rate of each
  group was calculated. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the DDP group). N = 3.
