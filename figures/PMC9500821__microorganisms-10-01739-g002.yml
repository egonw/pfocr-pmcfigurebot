caption: Induced systemic resistance (ISR) by beneficial microorganisms. JA and ET
  are central regulators phytohormones of ISR, and transcription factors (e.g., MYC2)
  mediate the increased responsiveness of this pathway to stimulation, known as priming.
  Transcription factor MYB72, as a root-specific transcription factor and early signaling
  factor, functions as a node of convergence in ISR elicited by beneficial microbes.
  (ET, ethylene; JA, jasmonic acid; NPR1, NONEXPRESSOR OF PR GENES1; MAMPs, microbe-associated
  molecular patterns; PRRs, plant recognition receptors; PTI, PAMP-triggered immunity;
  TFs, transcription factors).
