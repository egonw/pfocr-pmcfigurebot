caption: 'Schematic representation of the pathways of β-amyloid (Aβ) entry into mitochondria
  and its pathological effects on these organelles. The first pathway is via the TOM–TIM
  complex. This pathway has two options: (1) Aβ enters the mitochondrial matrix; (2)
  Aβ binds to TIM, thus disrupting the import of important mitochondrial proteins.
  The second pathway is performed through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria
  contact sites MAM (3). The formation of Aβ in MAM increases Ca2+ entry into mitochondria
  from the ER through the IP3R–GRP75–VDAC channel. The Aβ–alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD)
  complex induces ROS formation. Aβ inhibits fusion proteins (OPA1 and Mfn1\2) and
  activates the fission protein (Fis1), resulting in the formation of abnormal mitochondria.
  Aβ binding to cyclophilin D (CypD) leads to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mPTP). Aβ accumulation in mitochondria disrupts the ETC function,
  which leads to the formation of ROS and further death of neurons'
