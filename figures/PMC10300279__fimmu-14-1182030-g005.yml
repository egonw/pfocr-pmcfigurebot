caption: GSEA of HIC1. (A) GO functional annotation of HIC1 shows that HIC1 might
  exert biological functions in calcium ion transport in cancer, and modulating immune
  system. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of HIC1 indicated HIC1 was most commonly involved
  in the chemokine signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, as
  well as T cell receptor signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway in different cancer types. Peaks on the upward curve indicate positive regulation
  and peaks on the downward curve indicate negative regulation.
