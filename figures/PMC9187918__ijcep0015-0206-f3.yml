caption: Luteolin inhibited the activation of Hippo/YAP signaling pathway and cell
  proliferation in HCC cells. A. The protein levels of MEF2D, AMOTL2, phosphorylated,
  and total YAPs were detected in HCC cells under the exposure with different doses
  of luteolin. B. The relative ratios of phosphorylated and total YAPs protein were
  determined in the above HCC cells. The data represent the means ± SDs of triplicate
  experiments. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001. C, D. Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5
  cells were treated with luteolin at the specified concentration (0-80 μM) for 24
  hours. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 test. This experimental result was
  obtained through more than three independent experiments. The data represent the
  means ± SDs of triplicate experiments. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.
