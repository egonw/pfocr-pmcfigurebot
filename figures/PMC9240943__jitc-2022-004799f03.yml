caption: LP induces extensive immune remodeling of the TME via blocking of TLR2 and
  TLR3 signaling pathways. MC38-tumor bearing mice were intratumorally injected with
  PBS or LP. (A) Heatmap of NanoString immune-related genes. Red color represent upregulated
  and blue color represent downregulated genes, respectively. (B) Volcano plot showing
  changes in gene expression profiles in LP-treated tumors. Red line indicates p<0.05.
  (C) Comparisons of gene expression related to TLR2 pathway, TLR3 pathway, T helper
  1 response, T helper 2 response, immunogenic cell death, dendritic cells, macrophages,
  T cell activation, inhibitory ICs, and agonistic ICs. Pooled data from two independent
  experiments with n=6 per group (A–C). Values are expressed as the mean±SD. *P<0.05,
  versus control. Two-tailed Student’s t-tests were performed (C). ICIs, immune checkpoint
  inhibitors; LP, L-pampo; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TLR, toll-like receptor;
  TME, tumor microenvironment.
article_title: Intratumoral immunotherapy using a TLR2/3 agonist, L-pampo, induces
  robust antitumor immune responses and enhances immune checkpoint blockade.
