caption: 'Upregulated Linc00662 was associated with the malignant progression and
  poor prognosis of PC. A. Linc00662 was significantly upregulated in PC tissues according
  to the GEO dataset (P = 0.011) (GDS4103, 39 pairs of PC tissues). B. In the 30 pairs
  of PC tissues collected from our hospital, Linc00662 was higher in PC tissues than
  the adjacent tissues (P = 0.007). C. In the 30 pairs of PC tissues collected from
  our hospital, the expression level of Linc00662 was upregulated ≥ two-fold in 56.7%
  (17/30) of PC tissues. D. In the subcategory analysis, Linc00662 was higher in stage
  II/III PC tissues than in stage I PC tissues (P = 0.029). E. In the subcategory
  analysis, Linc00662 was higher in PC tissues with lymph node metastasis (N1/N2)
  than in PC tissues without lymph node metastasis (N0) (P = 0.009). F. The Kaplan-Meier
  survival curve indicated that high expression of Linc00662 predicted poor PFS in
  patients with PC (P = 0.043). G. Linc00662 was knocked down using siRNAs to screen
  for the most efficient siRNA targeting Linc00662. H. The CCK8 assay indicated that
  the knockdown of Linc00662 reduced the proliferative capacity of PC cells. *: P
  < 0.05. I. The wounding healing assay indicated that the knockdown of Linc00662
  reduced the migratory capacity of PC cells. Representative micrographs were displayed.
  The bar charts showed the differences of migratory area between Linc00662-knockdown
  PC cells and control cells. *: P < 0.05 magnification: 100 ×. J. The rranswell assay
  indicated that the knockdown of Linc00662 reduced the invasive capacity of PC cells
  and fewer PC cells invaded to the lower side of the membrane. Representative micrographs
  were displayed. The bar charts showed the differences of invaded cell numbers between
  Linc00662-knockdown PC cells and control cells. *: P < 0.05 magnification: 100 ×.
  K. A mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the effect of Linc00662 on cell
  proliferation in vivo. Images of transplanted subcutaneous tumors were displayed.
  L. The results showed that the knockdown of Linc00662 inhibited subcutaneous tumor
  growth of PANC-1 cells. *: P < 0.05. M. The results showed that the knockdown of
  Linc00662 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth of PANC-1 cells. *: P < 0.05. N. The
  effect of Linc00662 on tumor metastasis in vivo was evaluated in BALB/c nude mice
  by injecting PC cells through their tail veins. Representative images of lung removed
  from mouse models were displayed. H&E staining was performed to confirm the histomorphology
  of the metastatic lesions Representative micrographs were displayed for cancerous
  lesion in the lungs detected by H&E staining. Scale bar: 2000 µm. O. The results
  showed that the knockdown of Linc00662 significantly reduced the area of lung-metastatic
  lesions. The bar charts showed the differences of area of lung-metastatic lesions
  between Linc00662-knockdown PC cells and control cells. *: P < 0.05. Abbreviations:
