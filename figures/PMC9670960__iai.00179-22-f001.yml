caption: AHA labeling of BMDMs identifies 302 proteins selectively synthesized after
  L. pneumophila challenge. (A) Strategy for identification of newly synthesized proteins
  in macrophages infected with L. pneumophila. Methionine-starved C57BL/6 BMDMs were
  challenged with L. pneumophila-GFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15 and
  incubated for 4 h. AHA was introduced into the medium, and infection was allowed
  to proceed for an additional 2 h. Cells were then harvested and subjected to cell
  sorting, gating on GFP expression to identify macrophages with associated bacteria.
  The sorted cells from the GFP+ gate were lysed and incubated with alkyne-coated
  beads in the presence of Cu2+ to allow covalent linkage of AHA-incorporated nascent
  chains to resin (see Materials and Methods). An uninfected sample was also run in
  parallel. The covalently linked proteins with AHA incorporated were released from
  the resin by trypsin digestion and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis to identify
  all proteins translated during this time frame. (B) BMDMs challenged with L. pneumophila
  were blocked for protein synthesis. Shown is flow cytometry analysis of BMDMs cells
  infected with L. pneumophila at MOI = 15 for 6 h allowing for 2 h AHA incorporation
  as in panel A. Sorted cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with APC-phosphine
  to allow detection of AHA incorporation. (C) Flow chart demonstrating strategy for
  identification of proteins by mass spectrometry (MS). Modified Z-score analysis
  was performed (see Materials and Methods) (). To determine nonspecific binding to
  the alkyne resin, a control sample was used with the omission of AHA. (D) Modified
  Z-scores for protein candidates identified by MS in uninfected and infected BMDMs.
  Proteins that were absent from a sample were given a value of 0.001 as the lowest
  limit of detection (Data Set S1). (E) IPA-bases enriched pathway analysis of the
  list of newly synthesized proteins A (Qiagen Inc; https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com)
  Proteins identified, values, and statistical significance are described in Data
  Set S1.
