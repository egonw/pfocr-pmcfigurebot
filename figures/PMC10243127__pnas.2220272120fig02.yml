caption: GIMAP7, TGFB1, and NKG7 Gene Expression Changes Play a Key Role in Foralumab
  Modulatory Effects. (A–C) Foralumab-modulated gene expression of GIMAP7 (A) TGFB1
  (B) and NKG7 (C) counts across cell types and treatment. COVID-19 subjects were
  treated intranasally with 100 µg of Foralumab for 10 consecutive days. Analysis
  shows before treatment (day -2) and after Foralumab (day 10). Data from healthy
  volunteers were obtained in a dose escalation study. Selected data reflect a dose
  of 50 µg given for 5 d (n = 6). Subjects were followed up for 30 d. MS subject is
  a 61-y-old male with non-active progressive MS treated with 50 µg of Foralumab three
  times a week for two consecutive weeks (one cycle) followed by 1 wk interval. A
  total of five cycles was completed. Analysis shows before treatment vs. after treatment.
  C57BL/6 mice were treated intranasally with 1 µg of anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11, Novus
  Biologicals) or isotype control (Iso) for five consecutive days. CD3+ cells from
  cervical lymph node were FACS-sorted. For human studies, CD3+ cells were obtained
  from PBMC. Violin plots are median ± IQR. Student’s t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001. Arrows shows downregulation. (D) Gene expression levels
  of RhoAROCK1and CFL1 values was aggregated (RhoA/ROCK1 pathway) and scored in CD4+
  and CD8+ cells of healthy controls, Baseline (day -2) and untreated and Forlaumab
  subjects on day 10. One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post hoc was used for analysis.

  and increases TGFB1 and GIMAP7 expression in T cells in subjects with COVID-19.
