figure_title: Investigating neurological disease mechanisms with organoids
caption: a | Prenatal Zika virus infection causes microcephaly (left), characterized
  by a drastic reduction in brain size and head circumference. Studies in organoids
  have revealed the mechanisms involved (right). In healthy organoids (top), radial
  glia cells (RGCs) in the ventricular zone (VZ) are radially organized and have tight
  apical junctions (AJ; blue ovals represent nuclei of RGCs for which the cell body
  is not shown for clarity). In organoids infected with Zika virus, AJs between RGCs
  are destroyed and centrosome errors occur, leading to disruption of the VZ. Apoptosis
  of RGCs accounts for the reduced neuronal output and the size defect. b | Organoids
  can be generated from patients with familial Alzheimer disease (AD), sporadic AD
  or Down syndrome. AD pathology — including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles and
  enlarged early endosomes — develops in these organoids and neuronal apoptosis is
  increased. This pathology develops more quickly in organoids derived from people
  with familial AD or Down syndrome (2 months) than in organoids derived from people
  with sporadic AD (6 months). These organoid models are starting to incorporate interactions
  of neurons with microglia and the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which could provide
  further insights into disease mechanisms. c | Frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology
  (FTD-tau) is caused by mutations in the MAPT gene, which encodes tau. In organoids
  derived from people with FTD-tau, dysfunction of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway
  (ALP) occurs early and the excitatory lineage splicing regulator ELAVL4 co-localizes
  with tau in stress granules, resulting in splicing dysfunction, aberrant development
  of the excitatory lineage and consequent neuronal dysfunction, excitotoxicity and
  apoptosis. d | Timothy syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disease caused by mutations
  in the CaV1.2. Work on assembloids of ventral and dorsal organoids derived from
  patients with Timothy syndrome revealed inefficient saltatory migration movements
  of interneurons. Increased Ca2+ influx via the mutant CaV1.2 channel altered the
  cytoskeleton to reduce the length of saltatory movements and remodelled GABA receptors
  to increase the frequency of saltatory movements. e | In Angelman syndrome, loss
  of the UBE3A gene that encodes a ubiquitin protein ligase leads to accumulation
  of big potassium channels in neurons (top). 2D and organoid experiments have shown
  that neurons in Angelman syndrome have increased fast components of the after hyperpolarization
  (fAHP, middle). In organoids derived from patients with Angelman syndrome, synchronicity
  of calcium events was greater than in organoids from healthy people (bottom). f
  | Organoids derived from people with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) recapitulated
  the tuber and tumour phenotypes and demonstrated that abnormalities of caudal late
  interneuron progenitor (CLIP) cells underlie the disease. CLIP cells are vulnerable
  to heterozygous TSC2 mutations, which leads to their over-proliferation that initiates
  formation of tubers (dysmorphic interneurons (IN) and giant cells) or tumours. Part
