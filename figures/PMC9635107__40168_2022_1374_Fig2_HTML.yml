caption: 'Strain-specific carbohydrate/nucleoside metabolic processes of Bifidobacterium
  longum and Bifidobacterium bifidum are crucial to protect against diet-induced obesity.
  a Bodyweight curves in normal diet (ND) and HFD-fed mice treated with vehicle and
  three different strains of Bifidobacterium longum_MG723, Bifidobacterium longum_LM1062,
  and Bifidobacterium longum_Rosell175 (n = 5 per group). Statistical analysis was
  performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison. Data expressed as
  mean ± S.E.M. b Bodyweight curves in normal diet (ND) and HFD-fed mice treated with
  vehicle and three different strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum_MG731, Bifidobacterium
  bifidum_Bb06, and Bifidobacterium longum_Rosell71 (n = 5 per group). Statistical
  analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison. Data
  expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Veh, vehicle is PBS. c Differentially regulated genes
  and pathways in the different strains of Bifidobacterium longum. Left panel: network
  representation of enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes. Functionally
  related groups partially overlap. Right panel: heatmap of genes related to the pathway.

  bifidum. Left panel: network representation of enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological
  processes. Functionally related groups partially overlap. Right panel: heatmap of
  genes related to the pathway. z score was calculated to indicate the gene expression
  level. The statistical significance of network analysis for c and d was calculated
  using two-sided hypergeometric tests, and the false discovery rate was corrected
  using the Bonferroni step-down method. e A comparison of functional metagenome profiling
  was performed using the MetaCyc between small VAT (green, n = 51) and high VAT (yellow,
  n = 48) groups. The statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  analysis. For all graphs, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001. ns, non-significant'
