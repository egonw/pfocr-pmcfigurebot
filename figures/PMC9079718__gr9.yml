caption: 'BRU attenuates the therapeutic effects of MG53 combined with hUC-MSCs in
  AD mice. (A) Immunoblots of Keap-1 and Nrf2 protein and (B) densitometric analysis.
  (C) The swimming path of MWM. (D) The crossing times of mice in each group. (E)
  Time spent in target quadrant. (F) Discrimination index in NOR. (G) Immobility time
  in FST and TST (H). (I) Total distance and (J) total rearings of mice in OFT. N = 6
  per group. (K) Representative images of Nissl staining and (L) quantitative analysis.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. (M) Immunofluorescence images of Aβ and (N) analysis of Aβ plaque
  area. Scale bar=200 μm. (O) Immunofluorescence images of DCX and (P) quantitative
  analysis of DCX+ cells. Cell nuclear (blue) was labeled by DAPI. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 4 per group. *: Compared with the AD group,
  P < 0.05; ▼: Compared with the MG53+ MSCs group, P < 0.05. (For interpretation of
  the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web
  version of this article.)'
