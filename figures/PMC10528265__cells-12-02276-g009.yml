caption: Graphical summary of the expression and biological functions of IL-21 in
  grass carp during infection with A. hydrophila. (A) In the intestine of grass carp,
  il21 is expressed by the CD3γ/δ T cells after A. hydrophila infection. (B) The promoter
  of il21 is activated by A. hydrophila, and il-21 modulates intestinal inflammation
  through upregulation of the expression of antibacterial genes, anti-inflammatory
  cytokines and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
