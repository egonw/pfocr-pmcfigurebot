caption: The Structure of Leptin Receptors. All leptin receptor isoforms share a binding
  C-terminal extracellular domain consisting of 2 CRH regions separated by an IG-like
  domain and followed by 2 FNIII domains. The intracellular N-terminal domain presents
  a BOX-1 motif, which is critical for JAK-2 binding. OB-Rb receptor is the only isoform
  to present a BOX-2 motif, which facilitates the activation of JAK2-STAT transduction
  pathway. Additionally, OB-Rb presents 3tyrosine residues (Tyr986, Tyr1076, and Tyr1141)
  whose phosphorylation enables STAT3-5 activation. OB-Re receptor is a soluble isoform,
  which binds circulating LEP and regulates LEP plasma bioavailability and functionality,
  not being able to transduce any downstream signal. CHR, cytokine receptor homology;
  IG-like, immunoglobulin-like; FNIII, fibronectin type III.
