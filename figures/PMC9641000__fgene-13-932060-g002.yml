caption: (A) Table showing the number of differentially expressed genes that are common
  to all patients in a subtype and unique genes when compared to other subtypes of
  breast cancer. (B) Venn diagram showing common and unique genes among different
  subtypes of breast cancer patients. (C) A bar graph depicting the number of upregulated
  oncogenes and downregulated tumor suppressor genes in six subtypes of Indian breast
  cancer patient samples. (D) A table with a list of upregulated oncogenes and downregulated
  tumor suppressor genes. (E) Venn diagram showing common and unique genes among pre-
  and postmenopausal Indian breast cancer patient samples. (F) Bar graphs depicting
  gene distribution on chromosomes in pre- and postmenopausal Indian breast cancer
  patient samples. (G) Bar graphs representing significantly upregulated and downregulated
  pathways in pre- and postmenopausal Indian breast cancer patient samples. The y-axis
  shows pathway terms and the x-axis is the gene count. The color gradient of the
  bar is based on the p-value.
