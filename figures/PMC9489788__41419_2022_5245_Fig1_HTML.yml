figure_title: Expression profiles of circRNAs in CRC and circ_0003215 are downregulated
  in CRC
caption: A The differentially expressed circRNAs were analyzed in GSE121895 and GSE142837(Heat
  map). B, C RT-qPCR analysis of circ_0001955 and circ_0003215 in 50 pairs of CRC
  tissues and adjacent normal tissues. D Schematic drawing illustrating that circ_0003215
  arose from exon 7 and 8 of the MYO9B gene. The back-splicing sites (arrow) of circ_0003215
  confirmed by Sanger sequencing. E The product of circ_0003215 and liner mRNA amplified
  by the convergent or divergent primers in SW480 cells by agarose gel electrophoresis.
  F Relative expression of circ_0003215 in different CRC cell lines. G RT-qPCR analysis
  for the expression of MYO9B mRNA and circ_0003215 in CRC cells after treatment of
  RNase R. H Time-course RT-qPCR analysis of circ_0003215 and its linear counterpart
  MYO9B in SW480 after actinomycin D (5 µg/mL) treatment. I RT-qPCR analysis of circ_0003215
  levels in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of CRC cells. J RNA FISH assay for
  the localization of circ_0003215 in SW480 and HT29 cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.
