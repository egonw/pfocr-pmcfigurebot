caption: 'Effect of WA on the LPS-stimulated inflammatory signaling pathway in peritoneal
  macrophages. (A) Histograms represent the mRNA expression as determined by RT-quantitative
  PCR of NF-ĸB (p65) in LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages exposed to
  varying doses of WA, along with the BMS (0.05 μM), LPS-stimulated, and untreated
  control groups, after 48 h. (B) Protein expression and phosphorylation status by
  immunoblotting of p-65 and IĸB of LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages
  exposed to varying doses of WA, along with the BMS (0.05 μM), LPS-stimulated, and
  untreated control groups, after 48 h. (C) Histogram represents fold changes in protein
  expression as determined by densitometry of p-65 and IĸB of LPS (1 μg/mL)-stimulated
  peritoneal macrophages exposed to varying doses of WA, along with the BMS (0.05
  μM), LPS-stimulated, and untreated control groups, after 48 h. Experimental data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM of three or more independent experiments. * p ≤
  0.05 (comparison vs. LPS only), # p ≤ 0.05, and ## p ≤ 0.01 (comparison vs. +LPS)
  are statistically significant.'
