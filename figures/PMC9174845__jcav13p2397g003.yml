caption: ADAR1 deficiency represses ovarian cancer tumorigenesis in vivo. (A) SKOV3
  and A2780 cells with or without ADAR1 silence were subcutaneously inoculated in
  BALB/c nude mice. Two weeks later, xenograft tumors were harvested and displayed.
  (B) The weight of xenograft tumors was measured and shown in histograms. Data were
  shown as means Â± SD (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05).
