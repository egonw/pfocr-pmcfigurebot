caption: 'sFig. 1. Immune cell marker genes in in human autopsy lung tissues. Relative
  gene expression of immune cell markers in human autopsy lung tissues from control
  non-COVID-19 patients with other pulmonary pathologies and COVID-19 patients (GSE150316:
  Control n = 5, COVID-19 n = 8). Data represent the mean ± SEM.sFig. 2. SARS-CoV-2
  infection (COVID-19) affects the expression of insulin/IGF signaling pathway and
  Irf1 genes in mouse lung tissue of COVID-19 model. A and B: Gene expression of insulin/IGF
  signaling-related molecules (A) and Irf1 (B) in mouse lung tissues (A: GSE154104,
  SARS-CoV-2 infection, Control Day 0 n = 5, COVID-19 Day 7 n = 5). Data represent
  the mean ± SEM. #p < 0.25, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.sFig. 3. IRF1
  overexpression in HEK293T cells. Western blot image of IRF1, ISG15, and β-Actin
  in IRF1-FLAG overexpressed HEK293T cells.sFig. 4. rs17622656 eQTL analysis on IRF1
  gene expression in GTEx datasets. (A and B) rs17622656 eQTL analysis on IRF1 gene
  expression in human skin (A) and adipose tissue (B) of GTEx datasets.sFig. 5. Synergistic
  regulation of IRF1 gene in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Relative gene
  expression of IRF1 in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells were treated with TNF
