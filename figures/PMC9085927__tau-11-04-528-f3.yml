caption: PA induces the apoptosis of human CRPC cells via the mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway. (A) After the DU145 and PC-3 cells were treated with PA (0, 50, 75, and
  100 µg/mL, respectively) for 48 h, mitochondrial membrane potential was determined
  by JC-1 staining flow cytometry. (B) After the DU145 and PC-3 cells were treated
  with PA (0, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL, respectively) for 48 h, the protein expressions
  of Bax, Bcl-2, Cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, Cleaved PARP, PARP, Ki67, and β-actin
  were detected by Western blot. (C) Measurement of relative caspase-3 activity in
  the DU145 and PC-3 cells treated with PA 0, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL for 48 h. The
  results are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared to the control group, *, P<0.05;
  **, P<0.01. (D) The treatment group was pretreated with a caspase inhibitor (10
  µM of Z-VAD-FMK) for 3 h and incubated with PA (0, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL, respectively)
  for 48 h. CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability. The results are expressed as
  the mean ± SD, and compared to the corresponding group, *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. PA,
  patchouli alcohol; CRPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer; PARP, poly ADP-ribose
  polymerase; SD, standard deviation; Z-VAD-FMK, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, pan caspase inhibitor;
  CCK-8, cell counting kit-8.
