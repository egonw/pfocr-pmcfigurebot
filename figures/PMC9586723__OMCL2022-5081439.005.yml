caption: Exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ resists the proliferation, invasion, and migration
  of glioma cells. (a) U251 cell viability was measured by CCK-8 analysis after transfected
  with exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ (si-PDGFRβ-Exo) at 0, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h.
  (b) EdU assay indicated that proliferation ability of glioma cells was significantly
  reduced by exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ. (c) FACS assay analysis demonstrated
  that exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ induced more apoptotic cells in the U251 cell
  line. (d) Wound healing test showed that cell migration of glioma of the si-PDGFRβ-Exo
  group was significantly inhibited. (e) Transwell assay results showed that si-PDGFRβ-Exo
  inhibited migration and invasion of glioma cells (∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs.
  PBS or Unloaded-Exo group).
