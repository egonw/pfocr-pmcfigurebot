figure_title: EF alleviates LPS-induced ALI in mice
caption: 'a The chemical structure of EF. b The schematic timeline of the LPS-induced
  ALI model. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to an intratracheal injection of LPS (5 mg/kg)
  and subsequent intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (polyoxyethylene castor oil:
  ethanol: PBS = 1:1:8) or EF (25 and 50 mg/kg). Six hours later, the mice were sacrificed,
  and the lung lobes and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. c The
  right lung lobes were fixed, and hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate
  the lung histopathological changes (original magnification, ×100). d The lung injury
  score was calculated by histological analysis in different groups. e The total protein
  concentration in BALF supernatant was measured to determine lung permeability with
  a BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The data represent the mean ± SEM,
  n = 5 per group. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.'
