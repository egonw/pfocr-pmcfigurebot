caption: 'Model VI: Ultrasensitivity arising from multistep inhibition of BACH1 by
  heme. (A) Structure of Model VI, containing basal synthesis of BACH1 (k0), basal
  degradation of BACH1 (k30, k60, and k70), Heme-stimulated degradation of BACH1 (k3,
  k6, and k7), Heme-stimulated nuclear exportation of BACH1n (k1), nuclear importation
  of BACH1c (k2), Heme-inhibited reversible binding between BACH1n and ARE (k4 and
  k5). (B) Simulated steady-state dose-response of BACH1c, free nuclear BACH1n, free
  ARE, and BACH1n-ARE complex. Both free ARE and BACH1n-ARE exhibit ultrasensitivity.
  (C–D) Ultrasensitivity of free ARE and BACH1n-ARE, respectively, is lost or weakened
  when only one of the three Heme-regulated steps, (i) BACH1n nuclear exportation,
  (ii) BACH1n binding to ARE, and (iii) BACH1n degradation, is present as indicted.
  (E–F) Ultrasensitivity of free ARE and BACH1-ARE, respectively, is weakened when
  two of the three steps are present as indicted.'
