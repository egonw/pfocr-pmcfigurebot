caption: (a) HeatMap demonstrating the metabolites differences between cutaneous melanoma
  versus mucosal and uveal. (b) Random Forest analysis, cutaneous versus mucosal and
  uveal melanomas presented with distinct levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and kynurenic
  acid. (c) Scheme of Kynurenine Pathway. (d) Conversion rate (mean, SD) estimated
  by kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Tryp), levels of tryptophan, and levels of kynurenine
  according to melanoma subtypes. (e) Levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and kynurenic
  acid by melanoma subtypes, and kynurenic acid/3-hydroxykynurenine (KA/3-HKyn) ratio.
  ns = not statistically significant; ** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001.
