caption: 'The effect of Dex in POCD model. Assessment of the neurobehavioral abilities
  of SMA surgery mice. Number of mice for each group: Sham n = 9~13; Vehicle n = 9~13;
  Dex 10 n = 10~13; MCC950 n = 5~8; Dex + YOH n = 8~11. (A) Total distance travelled
  in the open field test. (B) Learning index (transfer latency time to enter the closed
  arm during the training periodâ€”transfer latency time to enter the closed arm during
  the test period) in the elevated plus maze test. (C) Discrimination time rate for
  novel objects in the test phase of the novel objective recognition test Sham, Sham
  control group; SMA, Superior mesenchymal artery surgery group; *, p < 0.05; #, p
  < 0.001.'
