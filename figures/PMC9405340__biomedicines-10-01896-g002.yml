caption: 'mRNA modulation during immunogenic cell death. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL:
  Mino) and breast cancer (BC: MDA-MB-231) cell lines were treated with two ICD-inducers:
  9-cis Retinoic Acid and Interferon-alpha (RA/IFNα) and doxorubicin (DXR) or exposed
  to not-ICD inducing treatment with gamma irradiation (gIrr). RNA-seq was performed
  through NGS technology. (a,b) UpSet plots of mRNA differentially downregulated (a)
  and upregulated (b) between control and treatments. The significance of gene expression
  changes was inferred based on an adjusted p-value < 0.5 and FC ≤ −1.3 (a) or FC
  ≥ 1.3 (b). The blue (a) and orange (b) horizontal bars on the left show the number
  of differentially expressed genes identified by each treatment vs. untreated cells,
  ordered by set size. The vertical bars display the size of sets of genes shared
  between comparisons and the intersection sets. The interaction between ICD inducers
  excluding not-ICD inducing treatment is highlighted in blue (a) or in orange (b).
  (c) Bubble plots showing overrepresented Reactome pathways in upregulated genes
  by ICD inducers. The y-axis represents the significantly enriched pathways, the
  x-axis represents the gene ratio (intersection size/term size), the size of the
  bubbles represents the number of assigned genes, and the color of bubbles represents
  the significance (negative log10 p-value). The larger number of genes classified
  into the pathway, the larger the node size is. (d) Bar plot of enriched gene ontology
  (GO) terms of upregulated genes by ICD. Y-axis indicates the GO term, x-axis indicates
  the significance (negative log10 p-value).'
