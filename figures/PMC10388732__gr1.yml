caption: 'BoNE-assisted formulation of formal definitions of macrophage polarization.
  a) Overview of workflow and approach used in this work. b and c) A pooled dataset
  of diverse human transcriptomes (b; n = 197) was used to build a Boolean implication
  network (c-top) and visualized as gene clusters (nodes, comprised of genes that
  are equivalent to each other) that are interconnected based on one of the six overwhelming
  Boolean implication relationship between the clusters (directed edges; c-bottom).
  d) Display of the major Boolean paths within the network prioritized based on the
  cluster size. Annotations of “immunoreactive” and “immunotolerant” ends of the spectrum
  are based on the expression profile of the gene clusters in 68 samples within the
  pooled dataset that were stimulated in vitro as M1 and M2, respectively. e) Reactome
  pathway analysis of each cluster along the top continuum paths was performed to
  identify the enriched pathways (for other clusters see http://hegemon.ucsd.edu/SMaRT/).
  f and g) Training (f) was performed on the 68 pooled samples using machine-learning
  approaches; the best-performing Boolean path, #13-14-3 was then validated (g) in
  multiple independent human macrophage datasets. For a list of datasets used see
  . The performance was measured by computing ROC AUC for a logistic regression model.
  h) Comparative analysis of performance of the BoNE-derived versus other traditional
  approaches in segregating M0/M1/M2 polarization states. i) Heatmap displaying the
  pattern of gene expression in C#13, 14 and 3. Selective genes are labelled. j) Validation
  studies assessing the ability of the genes in either C#13 alone or C#14-3 alone
  to classify M0/M1/M2 polarization states in multiple human macrophage datasets.
  k)Top: Schematic summarizing the model-derived formal definitions of macrophage
  polarization states based on the levels of expression of genes in C#13 (hypo to
  hyper- “reactivity” spectrum) and those in C#14 + 3 (hypo to hyper- “tolerant” spectrum).
  Bottom: A composite score of the entire range of physiologic and pathologic response
  can be assessed via the BoNE-derived path #13 → 14 → 3.'
