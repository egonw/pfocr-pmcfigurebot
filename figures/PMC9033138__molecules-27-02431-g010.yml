caption: Nigrosporins B combined with or without 3-MA, CQ and Baf A1 inhibited the
  proliferation of Ca Ski cells, cells were treated with 3-MA, CQ and Baf A1 for 6
  h, then treated with Nigrosporins B with different concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25,
  0.625, 0.312, 0.156 ÂµM) for 48 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
