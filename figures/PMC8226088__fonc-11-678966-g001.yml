caption: Pathway activity inference in head and neck cancer tissues. (A) Graphical
  abstract of the approach. In contrast to differential mRNA expression analysis of
  genes of interest (e.g., EGFR and PI3KCA), pathway activity can be statistically
  inferred by integrating expression values of all genes known to be perturbed upon
  pathway alteration. Adapted from “HER2 Signaling Pathway”, by BioRender.com (2020).
  Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates. (B) The PROGENy algorithm
  is used to infer the activity of 14 key pathways involved in oncogenesis. Activities
  are calculated by matrix multiplication of the normalized gene expression matrix
  and the so-called PROGENy loading matrix that contains the full human pathway model
  of 22,479 genes with associated pathways, weights, and p-values (). (C) Correlation
  between EGFR and PI3K pathway activity across the cohort. (D) Pathway activity-based
  grouping of HNSCC tumors. (E) EGFR and (F) PI3K pathway activity stratified by HPV
  status. (G) Heatmap of pathway activity matrix of the TCGA-HNSC cohort (n = 498).
  The column annotation contains genetic alterations and normalized mRNA expression
  values of genes of interest, as well as the HPV status.
