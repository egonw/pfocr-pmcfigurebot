figure_title: LPD-3 regulates INS-7 via the sphingolipid-ceramide-mTORC2 axis
caption: (A) Table summarizing effects of RNAi against genes in the insulin/mTORC1/mTORC2
  pathway on ins-7p∷INS-7∷GFP levels in lpd-3(ok2138) mutants. The asterisk (*) indicates
  GFP intensity qualitatively observed under an epifluorescence stereomicroscope.(B)
  Representative bright-field and epifluorescence images showing ins-7p∷INS-7∷GFP
  up-regulation in lpd-3(ok2138) mutants can be suppressed by RNAi against daf-2,
  rict-1, or hyl-1. Scale bar, 100 μm.(C) Quantification of the fluorescence intensities
  of INS-7∷GFP in lpd-3(ok2138) mutants with indicated RNAi treatment. Values are
  means ± SD, ****p < 0.0001 (N = 11 animals, one-way ANOVA, Tukey honestly significant
  difference [HSD] post hoc test).(D) Lipidomic quantification of hexaceramide species
  in wild type and lpd-3(ok2138) mutants. Values are means ± SD (n= 3 biological replicates,
  two-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD post hoc test).(E) Schematic showing biosynthetic pathways
  of hexaceramide, including sphingosine conversion to ceramide by HYL-1 and ceramide
  to hexaceramide by CGT-1/2/3.(F) RNA-seq results showing increased hyl-1 and cgt-1/2/3
  expression in lpd-3(ok2138) mutants. Values are means ± SD, ***p < 0.001 (n= 3 biological
  replicates, two-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD post hoc test).(G) Lifespan analysis of lpd-3(ok2138)
  mutants with control or rict-1 RNAi at 20°C, showing rescued lifespan (p < 0.0001,
  log-rank test).(H) Lifespan analysis of lpd-3(ok2138) mutants with control or hyl-1
  RNAi at 20°C, showing rescued lifespan (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).(I) Lifespan
  analysis of lpd-3(ok2138) mutants with control or sgk-1 RNAi at 20°C, showing rescued
  lifespan (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).
