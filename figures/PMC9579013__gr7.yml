caption: 'ATP is produced at the onset of sporulation to facilitating spore germinationLeft
  panels: At the onset of sporulation, RocG, activated by RocR and AhrC, catalyzes
  glutamate, feeding the TCA cycle and increasing the ATP pool in the pre-divisional
  sporanguim. A fraction of the produced ATP is stored in the forespore and subsequently
  in the mature spore. A threshold level of ATP determines the efficiency of germination.
  Right panels: show the scheme in the absence of the glutamate catabolic pathway,
  whereby many of the produced spores have ATP level lower than the threshold.'

  future spore germination.
