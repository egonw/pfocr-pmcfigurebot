caption: (A) A global map of LncRNAs in sensitivity-related triplets of different
  drug types. (B) Categories of lncRNAs in different types of drugs. (C) Genomic locations
  of lncRNAs. Each dot refers to a lncRNA. The colors of the dots represent different
  types of lncRNAs. The dot tracks correspond to different drug types. (D) GO function
  enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment of genes in the triplets related to drug
  sensitivity. (E) Hallmark gene sets of genes in the triplets related to drug sensitivity.
  The regulation strength represents the P-value in the hypergeometric test, and the
  smaller the P-value, the higher the regulation strength.
