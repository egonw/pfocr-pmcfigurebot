caption: Pexmetinib inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. (A, B) Cell
  viability of Pexmetinib treated BMMs tested by CCK-8 assays at 48 and 96 h. (C)
  The IC50 value of Pexmetinib at 96 h on BMMs (D) BMMs were cultured in osteoclast
  differentiation medium for 5 days followed by different concentrations of Pexmetinib
  (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 μM). (E-F) The number and areas of osteoclasts were measured by
  imageJ. (G) Bone-resorption pits were visualized by scanning electron microscopy
  following treatment with different concentrations of Pexmetinib. (H) Resorption
  pit areas were measured using Image J and normalized relative to the control group.
  Scale bar = 100 μm, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM, n = 5.
