caption: The CN vs. LMCI group comparison using amyloid GEAR biomarkers for the 29
  brain regions (a) showing significant differences, where we plot the negative log
  p-value for each harmonic wavelet at different regions (horizontal axis) and across
  frequency (vertical axis) in (d). In (b), we not only display the average harmonic
  energy in each harmonic frequency for CN and LMCI groups but also show the separation
  (measured by Fisher score) between CN and LMCI groups. In (c), we show the histogram
  of whole-brain harmonic energy for CN and LMCI groups in red and blue, respectively.
