caption: MPS peptide specifically suppressed the activation of MARCKS and regulated
  PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways in inflammatory breast cancer cells. MARCKS is involved
  in various cellular processes, particularly in the cytoskeleton control (by phosphorylation
  of MARCKS), proliferation, cell motility, and cell survival (by the PI3K/AKT pathway).
  Exposure of PIP2 on the membrane allows PI3K to phosphorylate it into PIP3, activating
  AKT-mediated signaling. However, this pathway is regulated by various factors, including
  PTEN. Our representative figure explains in part the mechanistic role of MPS peptide
  in IBC cells explaining how MARCKS inhibition subsequently inhibited AKT phosphorylation
  (represented by an orange cross and down arrows) and, more importantly, the upregulation
  of PTEN (represented by anascending arrows), leading to apoptosis and the downregulation
  of the MAPK pathway (represented by an orange cross and down arrows). These found
  regulations potentially led to the cytoskeleton rearrangement, proliferation, cell
  motility, tumor stemness inhibition, and apoptosis activation.
