caption: Antifibrotic effects of TSG-6 in TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells. (A) Inhibition
  of α-SMA expression by TSG-6 in TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells. (B) Inhibition of Smad3
  phosphorylation by TSG-6. Expression of α-SMA (A) and pSmad3 (B) was quantified
  by densitometry using Image J, and relative expression was normalized with respect
  to GAPDH expression. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01. LX-2 cells in the lower chamber were cocultured with
  ASCs and macrophages seeded in the upper chamber. Inhibition of α-SMA expression
  in LX-2 cells cocultured with ASCs and macrophages (C) or ASCs and RAW 264.7 macrophages
  (D). TW, Transwell.
