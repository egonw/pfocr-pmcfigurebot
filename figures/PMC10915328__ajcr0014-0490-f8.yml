caption: ANLN promotes prostate cancer development in vitro and in vivo by stabilizing
  the proto-oncogene c-Myc and activating the MAPK signaling pathway through IGF2BP1.
  A. Western blot analysis of IGF2BP1 and c-Myc expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells
  expressing different vectors. B. Western blot was used to examine the protein expression
  of c-Myc in cells treated with different vectors. C. Western blot was used to examine
  the expression of MAPK associated proteins in PC-3 and DU145 cells expressing different
  vectors. D, E. Xenograft tumor models showed that tumors grown from the shANLN-1
  group were smaller than those grown from the shNC group. F, G. The tumor volume
  changes over time and the tumor weight after dissection. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
  H. The representative IHC staining micrographs of ANLN, IGF2BP1 and c-Myc, p-ERK1/2,
  ERK1/2 in tumor xenografts. Scale bar = 100 Î¼m.
article_title: Anillin contributes to prostate cancer progression through the regulation
  of IGF2BP1 to promote c-Myc and MAPK signaling.
