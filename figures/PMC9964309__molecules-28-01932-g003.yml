caption: Network pharmacological analysis of the hepatoprotective activity of confusoside
  (CF). GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of candidate targets. The top 10 significantly
  enriched GO terms in BP, CC, and MF (A). The enrichment analysis of the GO enrichment
  analysis (B). The top 30 pathways of the KEGG pathway analyses (C). The enrichment
  analysis of the KEGG signaling pathways (D). For C and E, x-axis represents count
  while y-axis illustrates the enriched terms with ID and name; for D and F, x-axis
  represents gene ratio (gene count/gene size) while y-axis illustrates the enriched
  terms with ID and name.
