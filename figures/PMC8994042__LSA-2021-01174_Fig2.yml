figure_title: The 85-90 IFITM3 mutant colocalizes with and induces gross morphological
  changes in the Golgi
caption: '(A, B) Confocal microscopy analysis and 3D-reconstruction of cells expressing
  the indicated IFITM3 proteins. Colocalization of GM130 and IFITM3 is shown in yellow
  and grey, respectively. Representative images and graph presenting phenotype proportions
  in at least 100 cells scored per condition (binary scoring: inflated or normal Golgi,
  three independent experiments). *P = 8.3 × 10−9 following an unpaired, two-tailed
  t test. (C) Representative electron microscopy analyses of HEK293T cells expressing
  WT or 85-90 IFITM3 proteins. The region enlarged at the right of each panel corresponds
  to the red inset; cis and trans regions of Golgi marked. Source data are provided
  in the relevant section.Source data are available for this figure.'
article_title: A novel domain within the CIL regulates egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
