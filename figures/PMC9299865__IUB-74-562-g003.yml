caption: Schematic overview of NAD biosynthetic routes in mammals. The de novo pathway
  starts from the amino acid tryptophan that is first converted to QA through the
  kynurenine pathway. QA is then phosphoribosylated to NAMN by QAPRT and NAMN is converted
  to NAD by two consecutive reactions catalyzed by NMNAT and NADS. NMNAT adenylates
  NAMN to the corresponding dinucleotide NAAD and NADS amidates NAAD to NAD. NAD can
  also be salvaged from the three forms of vitamin B3, that is, NA, NAM, and NR. In
  detail, NA enters the de novo pathway after being converted to NAMN by NAPRT. NR,
  and NAM are first transformed into NMN by NRK and NAMPT, respectively, and NMN is
  finally adenylated to NAD by NMNAT. The sequential action of NAMPT and NMNAT also
  recycles back to NAD the NAM produced by the activity of the NAD‚Äêconsuming enzymes.
  The enzyme NMNAT can use both NMN and NAMN as substrates, and therefore it is common
  to the de novo pathway and all salvaging and recycling routes
