caption: Western blot results. Western blot results showing the phosphorylation changes
  in the p38-AKT signaling pathway. The phosphorylation level of p38 was elevated
  in the high glucose condition but was inhibited by safranal. However, there was
  no change in the phosphorylation level of ERK. Under a high glucose condition, the
  protein expression of factors related to cell migration and adhesion, including
  N-cadherin, Snail, Twist, and fibronectin were upregulated in a high glucose condition
  and could be inhibited by safranal. E-cadherin, on the other hand, demonstrated
  an opposite expression trend.
