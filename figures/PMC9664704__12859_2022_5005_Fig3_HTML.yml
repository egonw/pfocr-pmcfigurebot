caption: The relationship between pathway overlap and significance. The artificially
  enriched pathway (R-HSA-1483206) is represented by a red cross. Overlap coefficient
  values of each pathway with R-HSA-1483206 are shown on the x-axis. t-test p-values
  of pathway scores (testing for significant difference in mean pathway score between
  disease and control group) for each pathway are shown on the y-axis (-log10 scale).
  Note, for GSEA the p-values are calculated using the original GSEA permutation procedure,
  and for ORA, p-values are calculated using the Fisherâ€™s exact test. A LOWESS regression
  line is shown in black. Point size corresponds to the coverage of each pathway (i.e.
  the number of metabolites in the pathway which were present in the dataset)
