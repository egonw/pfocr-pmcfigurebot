caption: 'Ablation of Opn in hepatocytes decreases the early response to DEN. (A)
  Venn diagrams show the number of DE genes based on the RNA‐seq analysis of liver
  tissue from Alb.Cre + and Opn ΔHep mice injected with PBS (n = 3) or DEN (n = 4)
  and sacrificed at 48 hours. (B‐D) IPA analysis shows the signaling pathways changed
  by DEN in Alb.Cre +, Opn ΔHep mice or both. Red, blue, and gray represent positive,
  negative, or nonavailable Z scores, respectively, indicating positive or negative
  regulation of the pathway; “Up/total” refers to the number of up‐regulated genes
  among the DE genes within each signature (the rest of the genes are downregulated).
  (E) Heatmap shows the expression of genes of interest in all groups. Abbreviations:
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; and NaN, not a
  number (i.e., not available).'
