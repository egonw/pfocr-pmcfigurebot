caption: LRP1-medited AKT signaling is involved in secreted HSP90α-induced metastasis
  and EMT events in PC cells. (A) Kaplan–Meier curves of overall survival probability
  for low (red line) and high (blue line) LRP1 expression in 176 PC patients, using
  TCGA databases (log-rank test, p < 0.05). (B) Correlation analysis between the LRP1
  mRNA expression and the Snail mRNA level in data extracted from the TCGA databases.
  (C) The LRP1 mRNA and protein level after LRP1 knockdown by vector-mediated RNAi.
  (D) The LRP1, vimentin, Snail, and E-cadherin protein expressions in stably transfected
  shLRP1 Capan-2 cells. (E) The mRNA levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail and vimentin
  after stably transfecting shLRP1 in Capan-2 cells or in the presence of rHSP90α
  were detected by qRT-PCR. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of the results
  from three separate experiments (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01). (F) The invasion ability
  of Capan-2 cells after silencing LRP1 by Transwell assay. (G,H) The AKT and ERK
  signaling pathway activation in Capan-2 cells after rHSP90α treatment or LRP1 knockdown
  were detected by Western blot analysis. (I,J) The relative protein levels are shown
  in the histogram. The data are expressed as the mean from three experiments. * p
  ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01 and *** p ≤ 0.001.
