caption: 'A The fluorescence intensity of xenograft tumors was observed through injection
  of D-luciferin before sacrificing mice at the study endpoint. B Tumor volumes were
  calculated at the indicated days after tumor inoculation. C, D Representative images
  of H&E (C) and Ki-67 protein (D) staining of xenograft tumors from both groups.
