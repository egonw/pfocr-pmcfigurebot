caption: Effect of melatonin (MLT) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the myosin light-chain
  kinase (MLCK) signaling pathway in gastric cancer (GC) cells. (A) GC cells were
  cultured and treated with the MLT and 5-FU combination for 48 h. (B-E) The expression
  level of MLCK and the phosphorylation level of MLC were determined using western
  blotting, which were significantly downregulated by the combination treatment. The
  experiments were performed three times to ensure accuracy and consistency. One-way
  ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis. Data
  are presented as mean Â± SD. And statistical significance is indicated using asterisks
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
