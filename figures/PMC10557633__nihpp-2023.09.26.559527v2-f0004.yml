caption: The BMP pathway regulates the myogenesis of lung mesenchymal cells via the
  Smad independent pathway. (A) Activation of the intracellular downstream Smad1,
  p38, Jnk and Erk signaling pathways in WT and Bmpr1a CKO lung tissues was detected
  by the WB and quantified by densitometry. The levels of protein phosphorylation
  were normalized by the corresponding total protein and is presented as a relative
  change to the WT, *P < 0.05. (B) Gross view of whole lungs from Smad1/5 double conditional
  knockout mice (Smad1/5 CKO) and WT littermates showed that simultaneous deletion
  of Smad1 and Smad5 in lung mesenchyme completely disrupted lung development. (C)
  No airway dilation or cysts were observed in the H&E-stained tissue sections of
  the Smadl/5 CKO lungs at E17.5. (D) Expression of airway SMCs and elastin was not
  altered in E17.5 Smad1/5 CKO lungs, as shown by immunostaining of Cdh1, Acta2, and
  elastin. (E) Changes of intracellular signaling pathways in cultured fetal lung
  mesenchymal cells upon treatment with BMP4 (50ng/ml) and/or LDN193189 (200 nM) was
  detected by WB and quantified by densitometry. The relative change to the control
  condition is presented, *P < 0.05. (F-G) Altered expression of SMC genes at the
  protein level (Myh11) and the mRNA level (Myocd, Myh11 and Acta2) was respectively
  analyzed by immunostaining and real-time PCR for the primary culture of E15.5 WT
  lung mesenchymal cells treated with BMP4 (50ng/ml), LDN (200 nM) and SB (1 Î¼M),
  *P < 0.05.
