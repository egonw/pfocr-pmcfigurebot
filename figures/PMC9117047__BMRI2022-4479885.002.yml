caption: 'JDHY can decline liver apoptosis in ALF rats. (a) Western blot was used
  to check apoptosis-related protein expression (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and Bcl-2)
  in rat liver tissues. Compared with the control group (n = 6), Bax expression and
  cleaved caspase-3 expression were notably increased in the liver tissues of the
  ALF group (n = 10) and Bcl-2 expression was significantly declined. While both Bax
  and cleaved caspase-3 expression were significantly declined in the liver tissues
  of ALF rats, Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly upregulated in the ALF+JDHY
  group (n = 10) and ALF+BAY group (n = 10). (b) Immunohistochemistry was utilized
  to determine PCNA expression in liver tissues of rats. It indicated that the positive
  expression of PCNA in the liver tissues of the ALF group was notably lower compared
  with that of the control group. Through the addition of JDHY and BAY, the level
  of PCNA was increased. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group (n = 6), ##P < 0.01 vs. ALF
  group (n = 10).'
