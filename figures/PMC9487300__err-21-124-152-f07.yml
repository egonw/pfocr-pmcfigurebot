caption: 'Current therapeutic approaches targeting profibrotic signalling pathways.
  Those pathways potentially leading to fibrosis have been used to develop targeted
  therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment. Some potential therapies,
  which have had success in other disease areas, have failed. For example, tumour
  necrosis factor (TNF)-α blockers (e.g. etanercept) have been shown to be ineffective,
  and it appears that there is no significant role for agents that act on the endothelin
  pathway (e.g. bosentan). Therapies targeting anti-fibrotic and growth factor pathways
  are currently being developed. TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β; PGE2: prostaglandin
  E2; PDGF: platelet-derived growth factor; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor;
  TF: transcription factor; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor; TIMP: tissue inhibitor
  of metalloproteinases; PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; uPA: urokinase-type
  plasminogen activator; MMP: matrix metalloproteinases; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  TH2: T-helper 2 cell; IL: interleukin; IFN: interferon. Reproduced from [] with
