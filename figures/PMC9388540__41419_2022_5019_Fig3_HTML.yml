figure_title: Reduction of FMRP impairs proliferation of GSCs
caption: A Growth curves of GSCs transduced with either shNTC or shFMR1 (as indicated
  on top of each graph). The percentage of cell viability is plotted against days
  in culture (mean ± SEM, n = 3, two-way ANOVA). B The percentage of BrdU incorporation
  in the shFMR1 compared to shNTC GSCs (mean ± SEM, n = 3, ***P < 0.001, Student’s
  t-test). C Growth curves of GSC#1 transduced with the empty vector (CTRL) or with
  the vector overexpressing FMRP (+FMR1). The percentage of cell viability is plotted
  against days in culture (mean ± SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA).
