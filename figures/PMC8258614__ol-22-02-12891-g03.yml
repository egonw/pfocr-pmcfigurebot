caption: Metabolomic analysis of HSP60-KD cells. (A) Significantly changed metabolites
  in HSP60-knockdown cells compared with in control cells (P<0.05; fold-change ≥1.3
  or ≤0.75). (B) Metabolic pathway analysis and downstream function analysis using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed significantly altered pathways (Fisher's exact
  test; P<0.05) with the number of identified metabolites in associated pathways reported
  in the literature. (C) Adenine was increased in HSP60-KD cells by >30-fold. Data
  were analyzed using ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. ***P<0.001.
  HSP60, heat shock protein 60; KD, knockdown.
