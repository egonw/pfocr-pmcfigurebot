caption: LPS regulates UCP1 expression through the miR-143-AC9 signaling pathway.
  (A–C) The AC9 mRNAs (A), and AC9, UCP1 protein (B,C) expression levels in WT or
  miR-143KO primary brown adipocytes treated with or without 0.2 μg/mL LPS. (D,E)
  The AC9 and UCP1 protein expression levels in mice treated with 10 μg/kg LPS. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. controls. Different letters above
  groups represent significant differences, with shared letters representing no significant
  differences, as determined by a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (E) and two-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test (A,C).
