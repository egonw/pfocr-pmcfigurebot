caption: 'BPA, BPAF and PDTC induced the quantitative changes of p-NF-κB p65, COX-2,
  TNF-α and EGFR in VP. Content of NF-κB p65 (A), COX-2 (B), TNF-α (C) and EGFR (D)
  was obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results are performed
  as means ± SD, analyzed using ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test, n = 4. Comparison
  of the individual administration group and the control: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01;
  comparison of the combined administration group and the individual administration
  group: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.'
