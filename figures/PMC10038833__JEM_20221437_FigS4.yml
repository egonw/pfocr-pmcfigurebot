caption: 'Analysis of the macrophage populations and the comparison of key genes related
  to intestine barrier function and nutrient absorption function between chow diet
  and HFHS diet intestine. (A) Heatmap showing the top six most upregulated and most
  downregulated DEGs in CD8αα+ IEL-T cells between chow diet intestine and HFHS diet
  intestine. (B) Heatmap showing the top six most upregulated and most downregulated
  DEGs in CD8αβ+ IEL-T cells between chow diet intestine and HFHS diet intestine.
  (C–G) An independent cohort consisting of 10 chow diet mice and 10 HFHS diet mice
  were added to the previous cohort () to accumulate more macrophages. (C) UMAP visualization
  of mouse intestine macrophages derived from lamina propria of 20 chow diet mice
  and 20 HFHS diet mice is shown, where individual points correspond to single cells.
  Cluster analysis yields three distinct clusters: Ly6ChiCX3CR1lo monocyte-derived
  macrophage (blue), CX3CR1hi inflammatory macrophage (red), and CX3CR1hiregulatory
  macrophage (blue). (D) Feature plots showing the selected signature genes projection
  on UMAP. Intensity of gene expression in each cell was indicated in color saturation.
  (E) Histogram showing the proportions of macrophages derived from 20 chow diet mice
  and 20 HFHS diet mice. Inf. macrophage, CX3CR1hi inflammatory macrophage; Reg. macrophage,
  CX3CR1hiregulatory macrophage; Mono. Macrophage, Ly6ChiCX3CR1lo monocyte-derived
  macrophage. (F and G) KEGG pathway gene set enrichment analysis of DEGs between
  chow diet and HFHS diet mice intestine cells. The top seven most upregulated signaling
  pathways in response to the HFHS diet were shown. (F) CX3CR1hi inflammatory macrophages.
  (G) CX3CR1hiregulatory macrophages. (H) Heatmaps of selected genes that are involved
  in microbiota–host interactions, tight junction, and mucin functions. (I) Violin
  plots showing the average signature scores calculated for microbiota–host interactions,
  tight junction, and mucin functions. Each dot represents one cell. (J) Violin plots
  showing the average signature scores calculated for the absorption of distinct nutrient
  classes (fat and cholesterol, amino acid, peptide, and carbohydrate). Each dot represents
  one cell.'
