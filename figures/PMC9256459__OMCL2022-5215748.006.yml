caption: 'LINC00092 regulated ubiquitination degradation of PC protein in BC cells.
  (a, b) RNA pull-down assay and MS analysis were carried out to identify proteins
  interacting with LINC00092 in BC cells. N = 3. (c) RNA-FISH assay was performed
  to measure the location of LINC00092 and PC in cells. N = 3. (d) The samples from
  RNA pull-down assay were subjected to western blotting to test PC protein expression.
  N = 3. (e) RIP assay was used to confirm the binding of LINC00092 and PC. N = 3.
  (f, g) Following LINC00092 and sh-LINC00092 transfection, the mRNA and protein levels
  of PC were tested via qPCR and western blotting. N = 3. (h) IHC assay was utilized
  to test PC expression in subcutaneous BC tissues of mice. N = 6. (i) Following LINC00092
  (or sh-LINC00092) transfection and CHX treatment, the PC protein level was tested
  via western blotting in 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. N = 3. (j) In vivo ubiquitination
  assay was carried out to test whether LINC00092 modulate degradation of PC protein
  via the ubiquitination pathway. N = 3. n.s.P > 0.05, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the mock group; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. the sh-NC group.'
