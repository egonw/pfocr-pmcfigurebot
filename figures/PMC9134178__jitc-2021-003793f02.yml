caption: Ccl3 promotes DTX-induced proinflammatory macrophage polarization by activating
  Ccr5–p38/Irf5 signaling pathway. (A) Upregulated proinflammatory macrophage markers
  in RNA-Seq analysis of iBMMs treated with DTX (10 nM) are shown as heatmap. (B–C)
  Flow cytometry was used to analyze the percentage of F4/80+MHCII+ proinflammatory
  macrophages in cells isolated from tumors in , respectively. (D) iBMMs with Ccl3
  knockdown were subjected to DTX (10 nM) treatment for 2 days. Western blotting and
  qRT-PCR were performed to detect iNos and Cox2 expression. (E) BMDMs derived from
  FVB WT or Ccl3 −/− mice were subjected to DTX (50 nM) treatment for 2 days. Western
  blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to detect iNos and Cox2 expression. (F) iBMMs
  with Ccr1 or Ccr5 knockdown were subjected to DTX (10 nM) treatment for 2 days to
  determine iNos and Cox2 expression via western blotting. (G) Py8119-mCherry, Mvt1-mCherry
  or 4T1-mCherry were cocultured with iBMMs knocking down Ccr5 under DTX treatment
  for 2 days. (H) GSEA based on RNA-Seq results of iBMMs treated with Veh and DTX
  (10 nM). The NES and p value are shown. (I) MAPK family and Irf5 expression levels
  were determined via western blotting in iBMMs treated with DTX (10 nM) for 2 days.
  (J–K) iBMMs with p38 or Irf5 knockdown were subjected to DTX (10 nM) treatment for
  2 days. The cells were collected and lysed for western blotting to detect iNos and
  Cox2 expression. (L) iBMMs with Ccr5 knockdown were subjected to DTX (10 nM) treatment
  for 2 days. The cells were collected for western blotting to detect p38 and Irf5
  expression. Gapdh was used as the loading control. TATA-binding protein (Tbp) was
  used as the internal control. Data are presented as mean±SEM. *P<0.05, **p<0.01,
