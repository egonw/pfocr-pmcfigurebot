caption: CPE-based therapeutic measures. For autoimmune disease MS, specific blockade
  of the IFN-γ signaling pathway in the CP such as the addition of IFN-γ receptor
  antagonists or anti-IFN-γ antibodies may improve the development of MS. Targeted
  delivery of certain effective therapeutic genes through the specific recognition
  of the CP by AAV5 has very important therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative
  diseases of the brain or some refractory diseases. CPC can reduce CSF secretion
  by the CP, which has no doubts about the therapeutic significance for the CP, of
  course CPC is usually used in combination with ETV. Transplantation of the choroid
  plexus encapsulated in special containers such as alginate microcapsules into the
  affected brain can improve pre-existing neuroinflammation with potential implications
  for the treatment of PD. MS, multiple sclerosis; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; CP, choroid
  plexus; AAV5, adeno-associated virus type 5; CPC, choroid plexus cauterization;
  CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ETV, endoscopic third ventriculostomy; PD, Parkinson's
  disease.
