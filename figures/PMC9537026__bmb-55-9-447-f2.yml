caption: 'MiR-30a-5p and miR-153-3p regulate inflammatory factors through MAPK pathway.
  BV-2 cells were transfected with miR-30a-5p and miR-153-3p (50 nM) for 24 h followed
  by treatment with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. (A, B) Cell-free supernatant were collected
  and TNF-α and IL-6 were evaluated using ELISA. (C, D) LPS-induced ROS was measured
  through flow cytometry with H2DCF-DA (5 μM) for 1 h. (E-G) The protein was extracted,
  and the expression of protein level was detected by western blot to measure inflammatory
  factors p-JNK, p-ERK and p-p38. (H, I) Translocation of NF-κB was detected by western
  blot. BV-2 cells were lysed to cytosol and nucleic extracts. β-actin and Lamin-B1
  were used as an internal control. (J) BV-2 cells were lysed to whole lysates and
  NLRP3 inflammasome factors, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 and ASC. (K) The IL-1β mRNA
  expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. (L) Western blot analysis was performed to measure
  the expression of COX-2 in BV-2 cells. (M, N) Primary microglia cells were transfected
  with miR-30a-5p and miR-153-3p for 24 h followed by treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for
  1 h. The expression of iNOS was detected by immunofluorescence analysis (Scale bars:
  15 μm). Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Values of **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  versus control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 versus LPS group.'
