caption: Three metabolic pathways (i.e., carbohydrate pathway, glycolytic pathway,
  and tricarboxylic acid pathway) in soybean roots under drought stress. Enzymes showing
  up-regulation and down-regulation are indicated in red and blue, respectively. CES,
  cellulose synthase; G-1-PG, glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase; SUS, surcose
  synthase; UGP2, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase;
  GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; ALDO, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PGAM, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; aceE, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1; DLAT, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase;
  PC, pyruvate carboxylase; MDH1, malate dehydrogenase; fumA, fumarate hydratase;
  SDHA, succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein; sucD, succinyl-CoA synthetase;
  sucL, succinyl-CoA ligase; a-keDC, a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; IDH1,
  isocitrate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; ACO, aconitate
  hydratase; CS, citrate synthase.
