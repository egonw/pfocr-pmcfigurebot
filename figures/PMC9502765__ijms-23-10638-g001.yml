caption: 'Actors and regulation of gut barrier function. The central actor of the
  intestinal barrier is a single-monolayer epithelium, which undergoes a rapid renewal
  from stem cells (located at the bottom of crypts) followed by the differentiation
  of proliferating cells into several specialized cell types. Cells of the absorptive
  lineage (enterocytes/colonocytes) ensure nutrient absorption, whereas the secretory
  lineage comprises several cell types involved in other gut functions, including
  its barrier function: Paneth cells (in the small intestine but not the colon) synthesize
  antimicrobial peptides, and goblet cells secrete mucins and other proteins that
  comprise the mucus layer. The role of enteroendocrine cells, secreting a large variety
  of enteric hormones, in the barrier function is discussed by Osinski et al. [].
  At the villus apex in the small intestine (or at the surface epithelium in the colon),
  cells are shed in the lumen and die by anoikis. How the barrier integrity is maintained
  despite constant cell extrusion is discussed by Ngo et al. []. A major actor in
  the epithelial barrier function is the apical junctional complex, consisting of
  tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes (D). TJs control
  the paracellular permeability by differentially regulating the flux of ions (pore
  pathway) or macromolecules (leak pathway described here by Monaco et al. []); the
  deregulation of the latter pathway promotes the passage of potentially harmful molecules,
  which can trigger exacerbated immune responses. Many TJ proteins, associated cytoskeletons,
  and signaling pathways are targeted by intestinal pathogens, weakening the barrier
  function through mechanisms described by Paradis et al. []. Gut homeostasis relies
  on tripartite crosstalk between the epithelial cells, the microbiota, and the intestinal
  immune system. The gut mucosa harbors innate and adaptive immune cells, which cooperate
  to tolerate dietary antigens and the commensal microbiota while being capable to
  eliminate invading pathogens. In inflammatory bowel disease, dysbiosis and activated
  immune cells secreting proinflammatory cytokines exert harmful effects on epithelial
  cells and may generate a vicious circle of barrier disruption and inflammation.
  Endogenous opioid peptides locally secreted by T cells could have beneficial effects
  on epithelial integrity in this inflammatory environment as shown by Mas-Orea et
  al. []. Dramatic epithelial destruction can occur in the intestine upon accidental
  radiation or during radiotherapy. Metformin, a widely used anti-diabetic drug, was
  shown by Jang et al. [] to protect epithelial barrier function in a mouse model
  of radiation-induced enteropathy. Gut microbiota are key actors in the intestinal
  barrier. Commensal species compete with pathogens for intestinal niches and nutrients,
  and release antibacterial molecules as well as many metabolites that exert beneficial
  effects on host cells. Imbalanced nutrition and inflammation can lead to dysbiotic
  microbiota and the loss of beneficial metabolites. Strategies to restore microbiota
  diversity include a balanced diet, probiotic administration, or a fecal microbiota
  transplantation. In Crohn’s disease, enteral nutrition has several beneficial effects:
  it promotes the healing of the mucosa and also modulates the composition of the
  microbiota, as discussed by Boumessid et al. []. AJ: adherens junctions; D: desmosomes;
  TJ: tight junctions; and sIgA: secretory IgA. Numbers in blue circles correspond
