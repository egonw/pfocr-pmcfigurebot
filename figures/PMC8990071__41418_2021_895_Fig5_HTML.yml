figure_title: Cancer cells are sensitive for both apoptosis pathways
caption: We determined cores’ cells that A exclusively showed high sensitivity for
  MOMP (left), high caspase activity, high responses in both apoptosis pathways, and
  low responses in both apoptosis pathways (right; ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc). B, C Ternary
  plot of individual core’s cell fraction for exclusively pathway responses or sensitivity
  in both pathways. Overall, cancer cells show high sensitivity for the DR_MOMP modeled
  BCL2 pathway upstream of MOMP with about half showing also high caspase activity
  modeled by APOPTO-CELL. Stroma cells showed exclusively high sensitivity for the
  apoptosis pathway upstream for MOMP, while immune cells showed exclusively high
  sensitivity for MOMP.
