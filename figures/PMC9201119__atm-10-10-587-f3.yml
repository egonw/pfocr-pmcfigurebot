caption: GE protects mitochondrial function in RPE cells under hyperglycemia through
  the AKT signaling pathway. (A) The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the changes in
  RPE cell activity after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with AKT inhibitor
  under hyperglycemia; (B) RT-PCR was used to detect the changes of CYT C1 expression
  in RPE cells after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with AKT inhibitor
  under hyperglycemia; (C) the results of Seahorse cell energy metabolism analysis;
  (D-G) energy metabolism analysis results showed the changes in the basal respiration
  rate and maximum respiration after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, and GE combined with
  AKT inhibitor under hyperglycemia capacity, ATP synthesis capacity (***P<0.01, **P<0.05).
