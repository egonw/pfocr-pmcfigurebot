caption: Mossy cell‐specific overexpressing hTau N368 decrease multiple synapse‐associated
  proteins with remarkably disrupted Jak‐STAT and PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway. (a)
  Schematics show sample preparation for transcriptomic analysis. The mossy cell‐specific
  overexpressing hTau N368 in Calb2‐Cre mice was carried out as described in Figure
  . After 1 month, the DG subset was dissected and the hTau N368‐overexpressing mossy
  cells were sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACs) for transcriptomic
  analysis. (b) The mCherry‐positive cells were sorted by FACs, to evaluate the specificity
  of AAV‐delivered mCherry‐fused hTau N368 and mCherry expression in mossy cells.
  The boxed area (b, bottom panel) represents cells gated as significantly fluorescent
  compared with non‐fluorescent control (b, top panel). (c) A total of 917 in 16,923 genes
  were statistically significant up‐ or downregulated in mossy cells after hTau N368
  overexpression measured by RNA‐seq analysis. n = 5 mice in each group. (d) Top Gene
  Ontology terms for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in (c). (e) Enriched KEGG
  pathway of DEGs in (c). (f) Heatmap showing gene expression of DEGs in glutamatergic
  synapse, cholinergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse, and calcium signaling pathway.
  (g–i) Mossy cell overexpressing hTau N368 upregulated STAT1 with downregulated synapse‐associated
  proteins in dentate gyrus. Data were normalized to β‐actin and the mean value of
  mChery group for each protein. Unpaired t tests, n = 6 mice, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001. (j–l) Mossy cell overexpressing hTau N368 inhibited p‐AKT(S473) with
  reduced pGSK‐3β(S9) (indicating GSK3β activation). Data were normalized to β‐actin
  and the mean value of mChery group for each protein. Unpaired t tests, n = 6 mice,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (m, n) Heatmap showing gene expression of DEGs
  in F‐box proteins and cellular response to heat stress. Data were represented as
  mean ± SEM
