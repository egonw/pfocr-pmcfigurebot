caption: The hNVs consist of SαV-C-NVs, M1-NVs, and P-NVs, they could efficiently
  interact with CTCs in the blood, accumulate in the post-surgical site, repolarize
  TAMs towards M1 phenotype, and block the CD47-SIRPα ‘don’t eat me’ pathway to promote
  phagocytosis, eventually boosted antitumor T cell immunity, reproduced from ref
