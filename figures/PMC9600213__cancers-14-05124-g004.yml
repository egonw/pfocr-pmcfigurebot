caption: 'Resistant cells elicited a transition through ZEB1 and resistance through
  cathepsin L. (A) Immunoblot showing the expression of EMT and drug resistance markers
  in parental, topotecan-resistant, and carboplatin-resistant Y79 cells. Uncropped
  immunoblots are provided in . (B) Immunofluorescence showing the expression of TGFβ
  R-II and phospho-SMAD2 in parental and topotecan-resistant Y79 cells with and without
  TGFβ induction. Scale bar: 50 µm. (C) RT-PCR results showing the expression of ACVRC1
  in parental, topotecan-resistant, and carboplatin-resistant cells. (D) Immunofluorescence
  showing the expression of phospho-SMAD2 and cathepsin L (CTSL) upon TGFβ induction
  (10 ng for 48 h) and TGFβ inhibition (50 µM SB431542 for 48 h) in parental and topotecan-resistant
  Y79 cells. Scale bar: 50 µm. (E) Immunoblot showing the differential regulation
  of proteins belonging to the EMT and drug resistance pathway upon TGFβ induction
  and inhibition for 48 h. Uncropped immunoblots are provided in . RT-PCR results
  show the normalized expression of (F) ZEB1, (G) SNAI2, and (H) CTSL (cathepsin L)
  upon TGFβ induction and inhibition for 48 h. (I) Schematic showing the novel regulation
  of EMT and drug resistance mechanism in Rb tumors. Two-tailed Student’s t-test (for
  2 groups) and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests (for >2 groups)
  were used for the statistical analysis. *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ‘ns’ represents
  no statistically significant difference between the means of two variables.'
