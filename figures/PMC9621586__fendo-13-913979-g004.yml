caption: Expression of Smad and MAPK signaling pathway molecules during TGF-β1-induced
  osteoclastogenesis. (A, C) Protein levels of Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3, Smad4, ERK1/2,
  p-ERK1/2, p38, p-p38, JNK, and p-JNK were determined by western blotting in cells
  cultured with RANKL and TGF-β1 for 1, 3, or 5 days (n = 3). (B) Relative mRNA expression
  of Acp5, Cstk, and Oc-stamp was determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to that of
  Gapdh (n = 3). (D, E) RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 5 days with TGF-β1 and RANKL
  in the presence or absence of SB431542. Protein levels of Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3, Smad4,
  ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p38, and p-p38 were determined by western blotting. Representative
  blots are shown (n = 3). (F) Effects of SB431542 treatment on relative mRNA expression
  of Acp5, Cstk, Oc-stamp, Oscar, and Tak1 were determined by qRT-PCR. These levels
  were normalized to that of Gapdh (n = 3). (G) HEK293T cells were transfected with
  the WT TGF-β1 or p.R218C mutant plasmid for 48 h. Cell supernatants were collected
  for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of TGF-β1 levels (n = 4). (H) Western
  blotting of HEK293T cells transfected with the WT or mutant plasmid described above
  in the presence or absence of SB431542 was performed. Data represent means ± SD.
