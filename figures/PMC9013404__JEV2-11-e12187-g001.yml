caption: 'Conjugation of RBCEVs with EGFR‐binding nanobody promotes specific delivery
  of immRNA to metastatic breast cancer cells. (a) Schematic RBCEV modification: RBCEVs
  were conjugated with an anti‐EGFR nanobody and loaded with immRNA. (b) Flow cytometry
  analysis of 4T1‐hEGFR cells and parental 4T1 cells treated with 0.02 μg/μl uncoated,
  control (Ctrl)‐VHH‐coated and EGFR‐VHH‐coated CFSE‐labelled RBCEVs (n = 3). (c)
  Flow cytometry analysis of 4T1‐hEGFR cells and parental 4T1 cells treated with 0.02 μg/μl
  uncoated, Ctrl‐VHH‐coated and EGFR‐VHH‐coated FAM‐NC‐ASO‐loaded RBCEVs (n = 3).
  (d) qPCR analysis of the RIG‐I pathway gene expression relative to Gapdh in 4T1‐hEGFR
  cells and parental 4T1 cells treated with 0.1 μg/μl uncoated, Ctrl‐VHH‐coated and
  EGFR‐VHH‐coated RBCEVs containing immRNA (n = 3). (e) Schematic intrapulmonary delivery
  of EGFR‐targeted CFSE‐RBCEVs in mice bearing metastatic 4T1‐hEGFR tumours. (f) Flow
  cytometry analysis of CFSE signals in tumour cells and immune cells in the lungs
  of mice bearing 4T1‐hEGFR tumours treated with 25 mg/kg uncoated, Ctrl‐VHH‐coated
  and EGFR‐VHH‐coated CFSE‐RBCEVs (n = 3 mice). NEUT, neutrophils; MΦ, macrophages;
  DCs, dendritic cells. All bar graphs represent mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001
