caption: miR-21 is involved in the increased apoptosis of M1 macrophage and inhibition
  of inflammatory response induced by genistein. (A) Heatmap of miRNA microarray results
  in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS and genistein. (B) qRT-PCR of miR-155, miR-21
  and miR-125a expression in RAW264.7 cells with the treatments of LPS and genistein.
  (C) qRT-PCR of miR-155, miR-21 and miR-125a expression in RAW264.7 cells. (D) qRT-PCR
  of miR-21 in stably expressing miRNA RAW264.7 cells. (E and F) Cell viability and
  Western blot of pro-apoptotic proteins CHOP, BAX, cleaved Caspase 3, cleaved Caspase
  8 and anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 in RAW264.7 cells with stable miR-21 overexpression
  or repression treated by LPS and genistein (10 μM, 2 h). (G and H) qRT-PCR and Western
  blot of iNOS and COX-2 in RAW264.7 cells with the indicated treatments after miR-21
  overexpression or knockdown. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides; GEN, genistein; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
