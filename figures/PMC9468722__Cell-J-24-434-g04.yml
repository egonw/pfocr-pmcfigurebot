caption: BMPs signaling pathway in the regulation of germ-cell related gene expression.
  BMPs act via type I and type II receptors. These receptors interaction results in
  receptor I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (R-Smad). Two phosphorylated
  R-Smads in combination with Smad4 form a heterotrimeric complex which is transmitted
  into the nucleus and regulates the PGCs differentiationrelated target genes (such
  as c-Kit, Dazl, Mvh, Oct4, Ddx4 and Stra8) expression together with the other transcription
  factors (TFs). X-lined inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) also links the BMP receptor
  signals to TGFh1 activated tyrosine kinase 1 (TAK1). Then, TAK1 activates Map kinase
  kinase isoforms 3/6 (MKK3/6), JNK and NF-ÎºB. Mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)
  activated by growth factors (GFs) or cytokines (CKs) through Ras/Raf/Mek can inhibit
  the Smad nuclear translocation and consequently inhibit the BMP signaling pathway
  ().
