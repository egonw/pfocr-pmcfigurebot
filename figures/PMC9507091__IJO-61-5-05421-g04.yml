caption: Effect of EA on the autophagy of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. (A-F)
  Western blot analysis of the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins at
  48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells. β-actin was used as a control. (G) Transmission
  electron microscopy of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells following EA treatment for 48 h.
  Arrow indicates autophagosomes. Scale bar, 500 nm. (H and I) ROS production of MHCC97-L
  and HCCLM3 cells was measured by DFC fluorescence following EA treatment. Representative
  of biologically independent samples, n=6. (J) Viability of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells
  treated with or without ROS or autophagy inhibitors, as measured by Cell Counting
  Kit 8 assays. Representative of biologically independent samples, n=6. (K) Migratory
  ability of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells treated with or without ROS or autophagy inhibitors,
  as measured by Transwell migration assays after EA treatment. All data are shown
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. EA, eupalinolide A; Atg5, autophagy-related
  5; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
