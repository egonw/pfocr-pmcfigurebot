figure_title: Results of Gene Ontology analysis on differentially expressed genes
  identified by RNA sequencing
caption: Biological pathways found to be over‐represented (P < 0.01) among differentially
  expressed genes could be classified into Metabolic, Development and Tissue Injury
  categories. In each panel, ‘ratio’ (represented by bar size) corresponds to the
  number of genes that map to a specific pathway divided by the total number of genes
  in the pathway. The statistic ‘z score’ (represented by column colour) is used to
  infer the likely activation state of each pathway within the specific biological
  context under consideration based on comparison with a model assigning random regulation
  directions. A z score >2 or <–2 is considered as a strong indicator that a pathway
  is up‐regulated or down‐regulated, respectively. NaN, undetermined. –Log (P values)
  are represented by the grey dotted line.
