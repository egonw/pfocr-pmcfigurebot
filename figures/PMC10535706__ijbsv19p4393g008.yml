caption: 'Schematic diagram of A. muciniphila through Tryptophan metabolism mediated
  AhR/β-catenin pathway inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis. Gut microbes synthesize
  Trp outside cells. Trp enters IECs through various amino acid transporters and is
  metabolized endogenously: TPH1 (or TPH2 in the periphery) is the rate-limiting enzyme
  in conversion to 5-HT, and IDO and TDO enzymes convert Trp into Kyn. Kyn functions
  as a ligand for the transcription factor AhR that translocates into the nucleus.
  AhR induced Wnt/β-catenin activation and transcription factor TCF/LEF activity and
  promotes IECs turn into tumorigenesis.'
