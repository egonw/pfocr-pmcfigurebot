figure_title: NCOR2 deficiency or its functional inhibition creates a T-cell-inflamed
  tumor microenvironment
caption: a, IHC staining of murine NCOR2 (mNCOR2) in 4T-1 syngeneic orthotopic tumor.
  The tumor established by 4T-1 cells with KD of mNCOR2 expression was included as
  a control (representative data of n=5 tumors with similar results). Scale bar, 25
  μm. b, KD of mNCOR2 expression in 4T-1 murine mammary tumor cells using lentivirus-mediated
  transduction of shRNAs (representative data of n=2 independent experiments with
  similar results). c, The transcript levels of antitumor immune regulatory genes
  expressed in the 4T-1 murine syngeneic breast cancer tumors with KD of mNCOR2 or
  with scrambled shRNA (control). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.; n=4–5 tumors
  per group, the exact n are provided in the numerical source data). d, The amounts
  of CXCL9, IL6, and IFNγ in the protein lysates of the tumors described in c. e,f,
  The impact of mNCOR2 KD on IFNγ reporter activity (e) and the transcript levels
  of the indicated IFNγ pathway genes (f) in 4T1 cells treated with IFNγ (1000 unit/ml
  × 16 hr) or vehicle (n=3 independent experiments). g, 4T1 cells with KD of mNCOR2
  expression were more sensitive to IFN-γ treatments (n=3–4 independent experiments,
  the exact n are provided in the numerical source data). h, The average tumor volumes
  in the syngeneic 4T-1/BALB/c tumor model in wide-type mice versus in the same tumor
  model established in RAG1−/− mice following doxycycline-induced expression of murine
  DeCOR2 (mDeCOR2) and treated with paclitaxel (Pac) or vehicle (n=7–8 tumors per
  group, the exact n are provided in the numerical source data). i, The number of
  CD4+ TILs (CD45+), CD8+ TILs, IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ cells in the isolated CD8+ TILs
  and the ratio of CD8+ T-effector cells to FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells (n = 4–6 tumors
  per group, the exact n are provided in the numerical source data). j, 4T-1 cells
  infected with AAV-DJ-mNCOR2 were more sensitive to murine TRAIL (mTRAIL), Pac, or
  murine IFN-γ (mIFN-γ) (n=2–7 independent experiments, the exact n are provided in
  the numerical source data). Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. (c-j). *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared to control tumor (c,d), scrambled shRNA (control;
  e-g), wild-type mice (h), or control virus (i,j), two-tailed unpaired Student’s
  t-test, or ordinary two-way ANOVA (h).
