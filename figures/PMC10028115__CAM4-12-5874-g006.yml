caption: Determine the interaction between LAMB3 3′ ‐UTR and hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 in cervical
  cancer cells. (A) Potential binding sites of LAMB3 3’‐UTR and hsa‐mir‐133a‐2. (B,
  C) Interactions between hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 and potential binding locations in LAMB3
  3′ ‐UTR was researched by using luciferase reporter gene detection. The results
  demonstrated that hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 has a significant inhibitory effect on the luciferin
  of wild‐type LAMB3 3′ ‐UTR enzyme activity but has almost no effect on mutant LAMB3
  3′ ‐UTR luciferase activity. It proved that hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 directly targets LAMB3.
  (D, E) Utilizing qRT‐PCR to anaylize LAMB3 expression in siha and “caskiz” cells
  that were transfected with hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 inhibitor NC, hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 mimic as
  well as miR mimic NC, hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 inhibitor to verify the direct regulation of
  LAMB3 expression in cervical cancer cells. (F, G) LAMB3 expression in siha and caski
  cells that were transfected with hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 inhibitor NC, hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 mimic,
  miR mimic NC and hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 inhibitor was analyzed by Western blotting in order
  to examine direct regulatory ability of hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 has on LAMB3 expression in
  cervical cancer cells, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
