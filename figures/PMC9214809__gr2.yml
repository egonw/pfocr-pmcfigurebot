caption: Effect of seladelpar on gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes.A–F,
  primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with seladelpar (3–30 μM) for 48 h, and gene
  expression analysis was performed. G, Western blot analysis of primary mouse hepatocytes
  treated with seladelpar (10 μM) for 72 h. qPCR data are presented as mean ± S.E.M.
  of at least three independent replicates. ∗∗p < 0.01 denotes the significant difference
  between control and seladelpar.
article_title: Selective PPARδ agonist seladelpar suppresses bile acid synthesis by
  reducing hepatocyte CYP7A1 via the fibroblast growth factor 21 signaling pathway.
