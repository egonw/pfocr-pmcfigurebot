caption: 'BLCA sensitivity to paclitaxel depends on the expression of DNA repair genes.
  (A) PRISM analysis of the sensitivity of BLCA cells to paclitaxel [Log2 (TPM + 1)
  = Log2-FC] plotted against the expression of ATR mRNA (RNA-seq.). (B) PRISM analysis
  of the sensitivity of BLCA cells to paclitaxel [Log2 (TPM + 1) = Log2-FC] plotted
  against the expression of CHEK2 mRNA (RNA-seq.). (C) PRISM analysis of the sensitivity
  of BLCA cells to paclitaxel [Log2 (TPM + 1) = Log2-FC] plotted against the expression
  of CHEK1 mRNA (RNA-seq.). (D) Two-class comparison of mRNA expression (RNA-seq.)
  for the ATM gene between DepMap BLCA cell lines (n = 32) and all other cell lines
  in the database (n = 1063). (E) Two-class comparison of mRNA expression (RNA-seq.)
  for the PPARG gene between DepMap BLCA cell lines (n = 32) and all other cell lines
  in the database (1063). FC: Fold Change.'
