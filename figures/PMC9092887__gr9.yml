caption: miR-23b-3p regulates GSK-3β-mediated signaling pathway in the cortex and
  hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice treated with or without miR-23b-3p(A and B) Western
  blot images of GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β, p-Tau-Ser396, p-Tau-Ser404, and Bax (A), and bar
  graph showing the quantification of these proteins in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1
  mice following miR-23b-3p or NC treatment (B). (C) GSK-3β activity in the cortex
  of APP/PS1 mice following miR-23b-3p or NC treatment. (D and E) Western blot images
  of GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β, p-Tau-Ser396, p-Tau-Ser404, and Bax (D), and bar graph showing
  the quantification of these proteins in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice following
  miR-23b-3p or NC treatment (E). (F) GSK-3β activity in the hippocampus of APP/PS1
  mice following miR-23b-3p or NC treatment. Comparisons between 2 groups were analyzed
  by unpaired t test. The results represent means ± SEMs. n = 4. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus APP/PS1 mice treated with NC.
