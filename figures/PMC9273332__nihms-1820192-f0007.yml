caption: 'SCENIC analysis of Bcl11b KO impact on gene expression (A-C) Histograms
  of expression enrichments for indicated regulons, comparing cells from Bcl11b KO
  (FF) and WT controls (WT) at D10 and D13. Frequency (Y axis) plotted vs. regulon
  activity (AUC, X axis), means shown by vertical dashed lines. N cells for each sample:
  FF10 = 3236, FF13 = 3100, WT10 = 1075, WT13 = 1147, all from second experiment to
  avoid integration introduced data scaling. Full regulon data of individual sample,
  regulon gene lists and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are given in . (A) General developmental
  progression indicators: Ets1 and Lef1 activities increasing, Bcl11a and Spi1 activities
  decreasing with development. (B) AP-1-associated (FosB and Jun), Egr1 (immediate-early
  response) and Sox5 (TCRγδ-associated) regulons. (C) Ikzf2, Maf, Nfil3, and Rora
  regulons, showing increasing activity in Bcl11b KO after D10 and/ or concentrated
  in candidate terminal state. (D-H) Developmental distribution of regulon activation
  states, shown in UMAP plots of integrated WT and Bcl11b KO cells, colored with intensities
  showing relative activities of the indicated regulons. (D) Stem/ progenitor regulons
  (cf. , ). (E) Cell cycle-associated regulon Ybx1 (compare , ). (F) Developmental
  progression-associated regulons (compare panel A). (G) Egr1 and Sox5 regulons (compare
  panel B). Arrows indicate early-appearing bias of these regulons to Bcl11b KO subset
  of cluster 5 cells. (H) Other Bcl11b KO-induced regulons (compare panel C). (I)
  Proposed pathway of transcriptional regulatory cascade leading Bcl11b KO cells to
  alternative developmental endpoint, inferred from ,  and . The earliest changes
  detectable in Bcl11b KO cells at D10 include increases in Fos, Jun, and Egr1 regulon
  activity and Id2 expression. Upregulation of Ikzf2, Sox5, Zbtb16, Nfil3, and Maf
  begin later, based on regulon activity and gene expression. A hypothetical order
  of activation is shown, based on D10 to D13 changes in activities of these regulons
  and on the positions of the expressing cells in the UMAP plots, along the right-to-left
  trajectories for Bcl11b KO cells shown in  and , B. Id2 gene expression is seen
  initially in the D10 cluster 5 bifurcation between Bcl11b KO and WT cells (right
  side of UMAP plot, see  and ) but then begins to increase again from D10 to D13
  as KO cells move further to the left of the UMAP plots, reaching a maximum in the
  terminus of the Bcl11b KO pathway (cluster 8, ‘tip of exit’). At this terminus of
  the Bcl11b KO pathway, at D13 the cells finally upregulate Rora and shut off Notch
  signaling, thus exiting from the T-cell pathway.'
