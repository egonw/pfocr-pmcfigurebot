figure_title: Summary of the number of genes with expression alterations, and pathways
  relevant to hypoxia and cell stress signaling associated with biomass smoke exposures
  in the mouse lung and heart
caption: Gene counts are summarized along the left y-axis, with values in green. Pathway
  enrichment values are summarized along the right y-axis, with values in blue, representing
  −log BH p-values; therefore, the higher the value, the greater significance. Exposure
  conditions are sorted to show the smoldering conditions first, followed by flaming,
  given that flaming conditions generally induced the more robust responses. The full
  canonical pathway name for hypoxia signaling was ‘hypoxia signaling in the cardiovascular
  system’, and for cell stress signaling, ‘NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response’.
