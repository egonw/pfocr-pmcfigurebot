caption: Sphingolipids and glycerolipids and altered in multi-ethnic LRRK2 cohort
  CSF. Two-factor multivariate analysis covarying for age and sex revealed a significant
  effect of both Parkinson’s disease and LRRK2 G2019S mutation (both P < 0.05) on
  CSF lipid profiles. (A–G) Post hoc analysis identified sphingolipids and glycerolipids
  were different between Parkinson’s disease patient and control CSF samples. (H–J)
  Glycerolipid and sphingolipid species were significantly different between LRRK2
  G2019S mutation carriers and non-carriers. n = 88. WT = wild-type.
