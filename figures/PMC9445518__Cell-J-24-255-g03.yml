caption: Effects of cordycepin and CHIR99021 on the viability, migration and apoptosis
  of colon cancer cells. A. Viability of HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by MTT
  assay after treatment with 80 μM cordycepin and 10 μM CHIR99021 for 24 hours. B.
  Migration of HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by scratch healing assay after treatment
  with 80 μM cordycepin and 10 μM CHIR99021 for 24 hours. C. Invasion of HT-29 and
  LoVo cells was detected by Transwell assay after treatment with 80 μM cordycepin
  and 10 μM CHIR99021 for 24 hours. D. Apoptosis of HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected
  by flow cytometry after treatment with 80 μM cordycepin and 10 μM CHIR99021 for
  24 hours. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times and were performed in triplicates,
  and data were presented as mean ± SD. ***; P<0.001.
