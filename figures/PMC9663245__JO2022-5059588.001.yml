caption: The expression of WDR72 in lung cancer and LCSCs. (a) The expression of WDR72
  in LCSCs analyzed in the GEO database. (b) WDR72 level in lung cancer tissues and
  normal lung tissues analyzed in the Starbase database. (c) RT-qPCR analysis compared
  the mRNA of WDR72 in NSCLC tissues and normal tissues. (d) The mRNA of WDR72 was
  examined in normal lung epithelial cells and lung cancer cells. (e) The mRNA level
  of WDR72 was examined in lung cancer cells and LCSCs. (f) WDR72 protein abundance
  was examined in normal lung epithelial cells, lung cancer cells, and LCSCs.
