caption: 'T cells dysregulation in critical illnesses. T cell alterations include
  lymphopenia with polarization of Th cells towards Th2, increase of Th17 cells, increase
  of Tregs and reduction of innate T cells (MAIT cells and γδT cells). The main mechanisms
  responsible for these alterations are: lymphocyte apoptosis, autophagy deficiency,
  lymphocyte metabolic reprogramming and T cell anergy and exhaustion. Lymphocyte
  apoptosis: in the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-9 serves as an initiator caspase.
  The activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9 (mitochondrial pathway) is responsible
  for increased apoptosis. Autophagy deficiency results in reduced lymphocyte apoptosis
  inhibition. Lymphocyte metabolic reprogramming: during sepsis or burns, the increase
  of arginase activity induces a decrease of arginine with a subsequent reduction
  of mitochondrial activity and glycolysis. Exhaustion and anergy: in critical inflammatory
  diseases, T cells express exhaustion markers on their surface and have reduced capacity
  to proliferate and activate. They produce less pro-inflammatory cytokines and more
  anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. Finally, alterations of innate immune
  response contribute to T lymphocytes dysfunction. Monocytes and dendritic cells
  express less HLA-DR and have therefore, reduced capacities of antigen presentation,
  thus contributing to T cells anergy and exhaustion. NK cells produce less INFγ.
  The increase in MDSC is involved in the Treg increase, as well as in the Th2 cells
  polarization, in the inhibition of T cell proliferation and in the inhibition of
  NK cells cytokines production. ATP: adenosine triphosphate; Th2: T helper 2 cells;
