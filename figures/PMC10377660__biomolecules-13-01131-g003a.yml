caption: Apigetrin-induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in HepG2 cells. (a) HepG2
  cells were treated with apigetrin (0, 50, and 100 µM) for 48 h, and cell cycle states
  were perceived using flow cytometry. (b) G2/M cell cycle related proteins were identified
  by immunoblot. Densitometry was utilized to calculate values from three separate
  experiments. The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM).
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
