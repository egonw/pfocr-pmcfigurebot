caption: 'Effect of PSP2-1 on the MAPK signaling pathway in H2O2-treated HT22 cells.
  (A) Effect of PSP2-1 on protein expression of P-Erk, Erk, P-p38, p38, P-JNK, and
  JNK in H2O2-treated HT22 cells measured by Western blot; (B–D) Quantitated results
  of relative expression P-Erk, P-p38, and P-JNK. The data were analyzed using a one-way
  ANOVA and they are expressed as means ± SD. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and ### p <
  0.001 in a comparison with the control group; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 as compared
  with the model group.'
