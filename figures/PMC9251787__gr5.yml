caption: TET2 restrained the expression of stemness genes and the stem-like phenotypes
  of CRC cells.A, heatmap of the stemness genes displaying significant changes in
  stable TET2-knockdown SW480 and HCT116 cells, as well as in stable SW620 cells overexpressing
  the TET2-catalytic domain or mutant TET2-catalytic domain compared with their negative
  controls. B, FACS for CD133 and CD44 in the cells described in (A). C, tumorsphere
  cells derived from cells described in (A) were grown in stem cell culture media
  in suspension for 5 to 10 days D, the numbers of tumorsphere were counted from three
  wells and calculated as the mean ± SD. E–G, the in vivo tumorigenicity of tumorsphere
  cells derived from stable SW620 cells overexpressing the TET2 catalytic domain or
  mutant TET2 catalytic domain was assessed by tumor size and weight. Values were
  mean ± SD. H and I, correlation analysis of TET2 and Ascl2 expression in colorectal
  tumors with or without activating Wnt pathway mutations (truncating mutation of
  APC or Axin2 or missense mutation of β-catenin) from the TCGA RNA-Seq database (n =
  580). J, the mRNA levels of two Wnt-sensitive genes, Axin2 and Twist, were significantly
  inhibited in both HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with 2 mM IWP-2 for 72 h. K, quantitative
  real-time PCR for stemness genes in stable TET2-knockdown SW480 and HCT116 cells
  treated with 2 mM IWP-2 for 72 h. The results are presented as mean ± SD. ∗∗p <
  0.01. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. CRC, colorectal cancer;
  FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.
