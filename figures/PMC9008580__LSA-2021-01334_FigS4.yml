figure_title: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway up-regulation under low glucose promotes
  EGF stimulation of anchorage-independent growth (related to )
caption: (A) Representative Western blotting of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and PD-L1 in H358 cells grown for 48 h in 10 or 0.1 mM glucose (Glc)-containing
  medium with and without GlcNAc. Actin is used as a loading control. (B) Representative
  Western blotting of the indicated proteins in H358 cells grown for 48 h in 10, 1
  or 0.1 mM glucose (Glc)-containing medium with and without GlcNAc and EGF supplementation.
  Tubulin is used as a loading control. (C) Representative Western blotting of the
  indicated proteins in cell lines harboring classical EGFR-activating mutations found
  in LUAD. PC9 harbor EGFR-delE746-A750 and human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC)-53Gm
  EGFR-L858R mutations. Cell lines were grown for 48 h in various concentrations of
  glucose (Glc)-containing medium with and without GlcNAc supplementation. Tubulin
  and actin are used as a loading control. (D) SRB analysis of HBECs grown for 48
  h in 2D culture under sufficient glucose (10 mM) or glucose shortage (0.1 mM), supplemented
  or not with GlcNAc and/or EGF. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 (unpaired t test; n = 3
  separate experiments, normalized to 10 mM, mean ± SEM). (E) Cell viability assay
  of HBECs spheroids grown in sufficient glucose (10 mM) with and without GlcNAc and/or
  EGF supplementation (unpaired t test, n = 6 separate experiments, not significant,
  mean ± SEM). (F) Cell viability assay of H358 spheroids grown under glucose-limited
  conditions (0.1 mM) without or with GlcNAc and EGF supplementation. *P < 0.05 (unpaired
  t test, n = 6 separate experiments, mean ± SEM). (G) SOX2 mRNA levels in HBECs cells
  grown for 48 h in 2D culture under sufficient glucose (10 mM) or limited glucose
  (0.1 mM), with or without GlcNAc and/or EGF supplementation. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05
  (unpaired t test, n = 4 separate experiments, mean ± SEM).Source data are available
  for this figure.
