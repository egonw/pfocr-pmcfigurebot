caption: ATR inhibition by siRNA decreased liposarcoma cell proliferation. (A and
  B) Cell viability of 94T778 (A) and SW872 (B) determined by MTT assays after four
  days of ATR siRNA and negative control (NS) siRNA transfection. The data are presented
  as mean ± SE of the 2 experiments carried out in triplicate. (C) Microscopy images
  of morphologic changes and a reduction in cell number after 72 h of ATR siRNA transfection.
  (D and E) The expression of proteins ATR, p-ATR, p-CHK1, and γ-H2AX in the ATR-associated
  signaling pathway as measured by Western blotting in the liposarcoma cell lines
  94T778 (D), and SW872 (E) after 72 h of siRNA transfection. (F and G) Semiquantitative
  analysis of (D) and (E) by densitometry relative to tubulin. The data are mean ±
  SE of the experiment carried out in triplicate.
