caption: The effects of Centipeda minima (CMX) and brevilin A on the expression of
  apoptosis-related proteins in AGS human gastric cancer cells. (A) Representative
  images of western blotting for Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3,
  cleaved caspase-9, and GAPDH in AGS cells treated with CMX and brevilin A for 24
  h. (Bâ€“E) Bar graphs presenting the densitometric quantification of the respective
  western blot bands. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The error bars represent
  the standard deviation of samples (n = 3). * p < 0.05 compared with that of the
  control.
