caption: 'The hyper-branched phenotype induced by the KIF4 mutation is accompanied
  by altered TrkB-KCC2 pathway. (A) Golgi staining of the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal
  neurons of individual mice at P21; Scale bar, 25 µm. Sholl analysis for the dendritic
  arborization of each genotypic neuron. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 20,
  from 5 mouse pairs). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA). (B) Representative
  images of GFP-expressing CA3 pyramidal neurons from individual mice at P90; Scale
  bar, 20 µm. Sholl analysis for the dendritic arborization of each genotypic neuron.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 20, from 5 mouse pairs). **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). (C and D) Immunoblotting of M1, Hippo (C)
  and primary neuron (D) lysates from individual samples using the indicated antibodies
  and the statistics of the expression ratio. Quantification of individual protein
  bands with reference to tubulin and actin control bands. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 6 independent experiments). ns, P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). (E) Immunocytochemistry images of hippocampal
  culture neurons (DIV 18). Both the surface (top panel) and internal (bottom panel)
  TrkB were detected; Scale bars, 10 µm in the images of WT and Mut, and 30 µm in
  the images of IgG. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 20, four independent experiments).
  ****P < 0.0001 (Student’s t tests). (F) The RT-qPCR assay revealed the markedly
  increased mRNA expression of trkb fl, trkb t1, and decreased kcc2 in the mutant
  hippocampal and primary culture neurons. Primary neurons cultured under 5 μm AraC
  condition. Quantification of individual mRNA level with reference to act control.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 6 independent experiments). ns, P > 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). Source data are available for this figure:
