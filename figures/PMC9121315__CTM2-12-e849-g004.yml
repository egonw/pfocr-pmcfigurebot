caption: The ATP/P2X7 pathway regulated the hepatic PANX1–IL‐33 axis in endotoxemia
  in vitro. (A) Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations in the supernatants
  of primary WT hepatocytes and Panx1−/− hepatocytes at various time points after
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (1 μg/ml) (n = 5 per group). (B) ATP induced
  IL‐33 secretion by wild‐type(WT) hepatocytes stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 12
  h (n = 4). (C) IL‐33 levels in the supernatants of LPS‐primed (1 μg/ml) primary
  WT and Panx1−/− hepatocytes treated with ATP (0.25 mM), P2X1 inhibitor (10 μM),
  P2X2/3 inhibitor (50 μM), P2X3 inhibitor (50 μM), P2X4 inhibitor (10 μM), or P2X7
  inhibitor (50 μM) alone or in combination for 12 h (n = 4 per group). (D–H) Immunoblots
  and quantification of IL‐33 expression in LPS‐primed (1 μg/ml) primary WT and Panx1−/−
  hepatocytes stimulated with ATP (0.25 mM), P2X7 inhibitor (50 μM) or both for 12
  h (n = 4 per group). **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 by Student's t‐test or ANOVA
