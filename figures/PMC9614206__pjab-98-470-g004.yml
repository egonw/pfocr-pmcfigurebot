caption: Cellular phosphorylation signaling in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent responses
  in drought stress. SnRK2 protein kinases are major protein kinases involved in drought
  stress responses. Subclass III SnRK2s function in the ABA-dependent pathway downstream
  of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors and the protein phosphatase PP2C. Upstream of SnRK2,
  Raf-like kinases function as activators of SnRK2 in drought stress conditions. Activated
  SnRK2s phosphorylate and activate AREB/ABF transcription factors to upregulate stress-inducible
  genes. In contrast, subclass I SnRK2 functions in the ABA-independent pathway to
  regulate downstream VCS, which regulates mRNA degradation. This process functions
  in the recycling of ribonucleotides for the induction of stress genes. Names and
  functions of genes for transcription factors (TFs) and signaling factors (SFs) are
  summarized in Table .
