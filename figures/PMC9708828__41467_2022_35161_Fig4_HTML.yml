caption: a Schematic representation of the ABA-regulated OCAR. b SEAP levels in the
  supernatants of cells transfected with 40 ng pPW86WT (PPGK-SS-PYL1WT-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA)
  and with different amounts of either pPW116WT (PPGK-SS-ABIWT-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA)
  or pPW116C29S,C102S (PPGK-SS-ABI C29S,C102S-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA). All samples
  were transfected with 20 ng of reporter plasmid pTS1017, which encodes to tetO7-driven
  SEAP (OtetO7-PhCMVmin TetO7-SEAP). Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically
  independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t-test. c SEAP levels in the supernatants of co-cultured HEK-293 cells. Receiver
  cells were transfected with different amounts of pPW116C29S,C102S and pPW86WT either
  separately or in combination. Similar transfection procedure was performed using
  anti-CD19-synNotch-TetR-VP64. All receiver cells were co-transfected with the reporter
  plasmid pTS1017 (see methods). Sender cells were separately transfected either with
  pPW116C29S,C102S, pPW86WT, or with CD19 expression vector INS-2A-luciferase-2A-CD19-GFP.
  pcDNA3.1 (+) transfected HEK-293 sender cells are indicated as (–). ABA and DMSO
  were immediately added to the mixed cells, and SEAP measurements were performed
  24 h following the co-culturing. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically
  independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t-test. d SEAP levels in the supernatants of cells transfected with 40 ng pPW86WT,
  pPW116C29S,C102S, pPW97 (PhPGK-SS-PYL1-Notch1core-pAbGH), and pMMH241C29S,C102S
  (PhPGK-SS-ABIC29S,C102S-Notch1core-pAbGH). All samples were transfected with 20 ng
  of reporter plasmid pTS1017. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically
  independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t-test. Source data are provided as a  file.
