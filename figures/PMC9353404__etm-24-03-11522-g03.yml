caption: 'HOXB5 transcription activates ANGPT2. (A) JASPAR-predicted HOXB5 binding
  motif. (B) HOXB5 was upregulated in patients with esophageal cancer. *P<0.05. (C)
  HOXB5 upregulation was not significantly associated with low overall survival rate
  of patients with esophageal cancer. (D) Relative mRNA expression of HOXB5 was detected
  using RT-qPCR. (E) Protein expression of HOXB5 was detected using western blot analysis.
  ***P<0.001 vs. HEEC. Relative (F) mRNA and (G) protein expression levels of HOXB5
  in HOXB5-overexpressing EC-9706 cells were detected using RT-qPCR and western blot
  analysis. ***P<0.001 vs. pcDNA3.1. (H) Relative luciferase activity was detected
  using luciferase reporter assay. ***P<0.001 vs. ANGPT2-WT + pcDNA3.1. (I) Relative
  enrichment of ANGPT2 was detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation. ***P<0.001
  vs. input; ###P<0.001 vs. IgG. HOXB5, homeobox B5; ANGPT2, angiopoietin-2; RT-qPCR,
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; WT, wild type;
  MUT, mutated; TPM, transcripts per million.'

  and angiogenic effect of esophageal cancer cells via activating ERK/AKT signaling
  pathway.
