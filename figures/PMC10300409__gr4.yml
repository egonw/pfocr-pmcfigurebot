caption: Recombinant strains alter immune system responseAnalysis of tumor-infiltrated
  lymphocytes 7 days after complete treatment of 4T1 breast carcinoma-bearing mice
  (n = 3). The levels of F4/80+, CD45+, CD4 T+, and CD8+ T cells were measured. ANOVA
  was performed for statistical analysis; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 indicate significance.
