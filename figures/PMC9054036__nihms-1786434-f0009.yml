figure_title: Pluripotent stem cells undergo EMT during conversion to cardiac mesoderm
caption: A) Representative immunoblot of WT hiPSC for pluripotency markers (Nanog,
  Oct4, Sox2), tight junctions marker (ZO-1), Crumb complex (PALS1), PAR complex (PAR-3,
  PKC-ζ), Scribble complex (LLGL2, Scribble) and α-Tubulin. Molecular weights (M.W.)
  are indicated in kDa.B) Relative gene expression of NANOG, TBXT, NKX2.5, ANP, ISL1
  during differentiation. ΔΔCt values were normalized to the mTeSR1 condition (prior
  to cell differentiation). Independent biological repeats are color-coded (N=3 independent
  experiments). Mean +/− S.E.M.C) Relative gene expression of TBXT, EOMES, TBX6, MESP1,
  MESP2 during CHIR induction. ΔΔCt values were normalized to the mTseSR1 condition
  (prior to cell differentiation). Independent biological repeats are color-coded
  (N=3 independent experiments). Mean +/− S.E.M.D) Representative immunoblot of hiPSCs
  and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes obtained 12 days post differentiation (Top pathway
  described in ). Expression of EMT markers (Slug and E-Cadherin) were analyzed. Molecular
  weights (M.W.) are indicated in kDa. (N=2 independent experiments).E) Relative gene
  expression of VIM was analyzed by qRT-PCR during cell conversion. ΔΔCt values were
  normalized to the mTseSR1 condition. Independent biological repeats are color-coded
  (N=3 independent experiments). Mean +/− S.E.M.F) Representative Max IPs images of
  wildtype hiPSCs fixed at the indicated times along the differentiation protocol
  and stained for F-actin (Phalloidin) and nuclei (Hoechst). Scale bar = 50 μm. Magnified
  area of the F-actin channel (yellow dotted square) is shown. Scale bar = 10 μm.G)
  Representative Immunoblot comparing expression of EMT markers (E-Cadherin, Snail,
  Slug) and cardiac marker (HAND1) between the two protocols shown in .H-I) Immunoblot
  of PARP cleavage in hESC H9 during CHIR treatment. Molecular weights (M.W.) are
  indicated in kDa (H). PARP cleavage was quantified by densitometry across 2 independent
  biological repeats (color-coded). Tukey’s multiple comparison was applied (I).J)
  Snail and Slug expression was analyzed in hESC H9 following CHIR induction. Molecular
  weights (M.W.) are indicated in kDa.Source numerical data and unprocessed blots
  are available in source data.
