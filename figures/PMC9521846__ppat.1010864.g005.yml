figure_title: Trypanosoma brucei RPI complementation restored the growth defects of
  TgRPI depletion mutants
caption: (A), Schematic diagram showing the insertion of a Trypanosoma brucei RPI
  expressing mini gene into the UPRT locus of the Δrpi strain by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated
  site-specific integration and selection with 10 μM FUDR. (B), Diagnostic PCRs on
  a selected compTbRPI clone. PCR4 examined the successful insertion of Trypanosoma
  brucei RPI on the UPRT locus, whereas PCR5 confirmed the deletion of the endogenous
  UPRT locus. (C), Expression of the complementing Trypanosoma brucei RPI as shown
  by IFA using rabbit anti-HA. (D-E), Plaque assays comparing the growth of TgRPI
  depletion strain before and after Trypanosoma brucei RPI complementation. Means
  ± SD of more than 60 plaques for each strain was graphed. Student’s t-test, ***,
  P < 0.001. (F), Intracellular replication rates of depicted strains (24 h post-infection).
  Means ±SEM from three independent experiments (n = 3), each with two replicates.
  ***, P < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA. (G), The invasion efficiency of the compTbRPI was
  compared to the TgRPI-cKD and Δrpi parasites. Means ±SD of more than 100 fields
  from three independent assays, ***, P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA.
