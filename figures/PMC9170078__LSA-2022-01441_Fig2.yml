figure_title: FT has mutations in ribD and does not activate MAIT cells
caption: (A) Schematic of the riboflavin synthetic pathway. The precursor of the MAIT
  cell antigen presented by MR1 is highlighted in red. (B) Plots of normalized read
  counts of genes ribAB, ribD, ribH, and ribC in the free-living and pathogenic strains.
  (C) Comparison of the amino acid sequence of RibD in the pathogenic and free-living
  strain. Boxed amino acids (red) are the zinc-binding region of the cytidine and
  deoxycytidylate deaminase domain. Underlined amino acid sequences are catalytic
  domains. (D) Summary table of amino acids at five defined positions in RibD in free-living
  (black) and pathogenic (red) strains as found in the KEGG database. (E, F) GFP-reporter
  activities of cells expressing human (E) and mouse (F) MAIT TCRs after stimulation
  with escalating amounts (1, 3, 9 μl) of total metabolites from the indicated strains
  that were cultured in the presence of human and mouse MR1-expressing cells, with
  or without anti-MR1 antibody (Ab) (10 μg/ml). Data are representative of three independent
  experiments.
