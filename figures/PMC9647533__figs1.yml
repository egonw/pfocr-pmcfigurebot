caption: Effects of NF-κB p65 inhibitor and sh-XIST on IBS-D mice.A, the miR-16 and
  XIST expressions as detected by RT-qPCR (left panel) and the expressions of TLR4
  and NF-κB p65 as detected by Western blot (right panel) in colonic mucosal tissues
  of IBS-D mice in response to NF-κB-inhibitor or sh-XIST. B, the levels of IL-1β
  and IL-6 in serum of as detected by Western blot (right panel) as detected by ELISA;
  C, HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of rectal mucosa of
  IBS-D mice in response to NF-κB-inhibitor or sh-XIST. ∗p < 0.05.
