caption: Relative phosphorylation levels of various proteins involved in the MAPK
  and PI3K signaling pathway in PC cells. (A–D) The intensities of phosphorylated
  (A) JNK, (B) AKT, (C) P38, and (D) ERK1/2 were estimated by immunoblotting tests.
  The protein level of each target was normalized according to the levels of each
  total protein. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The degree of statistical
  significance among control and matairesinol-treated groups is represented by asterisks,
  as determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s
  post hoc analysis (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001).
