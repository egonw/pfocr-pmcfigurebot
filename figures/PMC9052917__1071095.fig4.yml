caption: 'The Bb level is increased in COVID-19 patient serum and associated with
  disease severity. Serum Bb level was significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients
  who required minimal oxygen support, high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (Hi-Flow
  oxygen) and mechanical ventilation (Vent) as compared to pooled normal human serum
  (NHS) and healthy controls (healthy ctrl). Patients requiring mechanical ventilation
  also had significantly higher serum Bb level than patients with minimal oxygen support
  (P<0.05), suggesting greater alternative pathway of complement dysregulation. All
  experiments were run in duplicate. CVF: cobra venom factor (used as a positive control).'
