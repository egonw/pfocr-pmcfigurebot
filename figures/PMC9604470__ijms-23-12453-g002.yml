caption: 'Modulation of IL-6 mRNA and protein levels and JAK1 activation in rats exposed
  to CMS and treated with agomelatine. mRNA levels of IL-6 were assessed in prefrontal
  cortex (A) and in ventral and dorsal subregions of hippocampus (B). Protein levels
  of IL-6 and activation of JAK1 (ratio at tyrosine 1022/1023) were measured in prefrontal
  cortex of rats exposed to CMS and/or to chronic treatment with agomelatine (C,D).
  Data, expressed as percentage vs. unstressed rats treated with vehicle (No Stress/Vehicle,
  set at 100%), are mean Â± SEM of at least 7 independent determinations. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. No Stress/Vehicle; ### p < 0.001 vs. Stress/Vehicle
  (two-way ANOVA with PLSD).'
