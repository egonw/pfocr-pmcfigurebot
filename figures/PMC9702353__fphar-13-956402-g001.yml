caption: 'FLaAN/C reduces symptoms in EAE mice. (A) Study procedure. (B) Weight-versus-time
  curves of all experimental groups. (C) Clinical behavior scores for typical symptoms
  of EAE. (D) LFB staining showing demyelination in the spinal cord and the demyelination
  scores (The arrows present myelin injury and loss, scale bars:50 μm). (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining of MBP in the spinal cord (The arrows present myelin injury and loss, scale
  bars:100 μm). (F)Western bloting of MBP protein expression of the spinal cord. (G)
  Representative images show behavioral symptoms of EAE mice in each group (Black
  arrows present limp tail or hind limb paralysis). Paraffin sections of spinal cord
  tissue used for immunofluorescence staining. Data are shown as means ± SD (n = 6
  per group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, #p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, ####p < 0.0001. * vs. Control group; # vs. MOG group.'
