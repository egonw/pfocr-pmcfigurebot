caption: 'Aβ42 activates NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS‐primed microglia. Primary microglia
  were untreated (Veh) or primed with LPS (10 ng/ml, 3 h), followed by Aβ42 (4 μM)
  for 24 h. (a) Immunoblot showed that the protein expression levels of pro‐IL‐1β,
  pro‐IL‐18, and caspase‐1 (p20) were elevated after adding Aβ42 in LPS‐primed microglia.
  (b–d) Quantification of pro‐IL‐1β (b), pro‐IL‐18 (c) and caspase‐1 (d). (e) Representative
  immunofluorescence image of primary microglia with anti‐caspase‐1 (green). DAPI
  represents the nuclear signal (blue). Scale bar: 20 μm. (f) Quantification of immunofluorescence
  of caspase‐1. (g–i) The mRNA gene expression of NLRP3 (g), IL‐1β (h), and IL‐18
  (i) was measured by real‐time PCR and expressed as relative fold change to vehicle
  group. (j) Immunofluorescence staining for ASC (red) speck. Scale bar: 20 μm. (k)
  Percentages of microglia containing ASC foci were quantified. (l) Immunoblot analysis
  of indicated proteins in conditioned media. Proteins from equal initial volumes
  were precipitated by TCA, and the levels of secreted proteins were quantified. (m–p)
  Quantification of secreted ASC (m), cleaved caspase‐1 (n), mature IL‐1β (o), and
  mature IL‐18 (p). (q) Immunoblot analysis of signaling proteins from cell lysates.
  (r–t) Quantitative analysis showed relative level of pSyk/Syk (r), pAMPK/AMPK (s),
  and pAkt/Akt (t). All data are shown as means ± SEM from four independent experiments
  and are analyzed by unpaired Student''s t test. Confocal imaging data are from 5
  randomly chosen fields per coverslip (e) or at least 200 cells per group (j). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001'
