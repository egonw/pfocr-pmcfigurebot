caption: LncRNA HOXA10-AS inhibits the apoptosis of PCs in vitro. a-b Western blot
  was performed to detect designated proteins in each cell line transfected with specific
  plasmids. c-d Flow cytometry analysis was applied to detect cell apoptosis for two
  cell lines transfected with corelated plasmids. d revealed quantification of the
  data shown in c. e-f CCK8 was performed to evaluate the cell viability of PANC-1
  (e) and CFPAC-1 (f). Each experiment was performed three times independently and
  results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was used to analyze the data.
