caption: LncRNA HAR1A promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC
  cells. (a) The expression levels of lncRNA HAR1A in five NSCLC cell lines as well
  as normal lung epithelial cells by qRT-PCR. (b) qRT-PCR results confirmed loss or
  gain function of lncRNA HAR1A in NCI-1975 and A549 cells. Impacts of the knockdown
  (c) of overexpression (d) of lncRNA HAR1A on apoptosis of NSCLC cells. After Annexin
  V and PI double staining, the percentage of apoptotic cells was estimated using
  flow cytometry. (e) The growth curve of A549 cells infected with lentivirus-mediated
  shRNA oligos targeting lncRNA HAR1A or scramble sequences (Ctrl). (f) The growth
  curve of A549 cells infected with empty vector (Ctrl) or lentivirus-mediated lncRNA
  HAR1A. Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay at 24, 48, and 72 h. (g)
  The expression of apoptotic (BAX and BCL-2) and proliferative (MCM2 and PCNA) biomarkers
  were examined in NSCLC cells by western blot. The experiment was performed in triplicate,
  and data were calculated from three independent experiments using statistical analysis.
