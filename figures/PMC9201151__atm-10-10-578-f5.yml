caption: Metabolic analysis of liver tissue in the sham, CLP, and agmatine treatment
  groups (rats were treated with 300 mg/kg of agmatine). (A) Scatter plot of liver
  metabolite scores in the sham-operated group, CLP group, and agmatine-treated group,
  as determined by the PLS-DA positive pattern. (B) Scatter plots of liver metabolite
  scores in sham group, CLP group, and agmatine-treated group, as determined using
  the OPLS-DA negative mode. (C) Number of regulated genes after agmatine treatment;
  red represents down-regulated genes and green represents up-regulated genes. (D)
  Venn diagram showing the number of commonly disturbed metabolites in the liver.
  (E) Network pathway after agmatine treatment versus the CLP group. (F) Pathway P
  value bar plot. (G-I) Heat maps of metabolites in the linoleic acid, arginine and
  proline, and glutathione metabolic pathways. PLS-DA, partial least square discriminant
  analysis; CLP, cecal ligation and perforation; DE, differential; FC, fold change;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
