figure_title: Genes up-regulated across diverse tumor types in TCGA project
caption: HMBS, the third enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, and FLVCR1, the
  heme exporter, show significant up-regulation in most of the tumor types. In addition,
  oncogenic signaling genes AURKA, KRAS, and MYC are up-regulated in diverse tumor
  types. The x-axis scale represents the degree of gene overexpression in diverse
  tumor types, whereas the tumor tissue gene expression index indicates the extent
  of up-regulation across different tumor types. P-values were calculated using the
  Mann–Whitney test, adjusted with the Benjamin–Hochberg multiple hypothesis corrections.
