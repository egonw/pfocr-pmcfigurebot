caption: Inhibition of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway enhances the antiviral
  effect of HBV‐CRISPR in HBV‐infected hepatoma cells. (A–C) HepG2‐hNTCP‐C4‐iCas9
  cells transduced with HBV gRNA were treated with DOX 4 days after HBV inoculation
  (10,000 GEq/cell) and then with siRNA 7 and 10 days after HBV inoculation. (A) Experimental
  protocol. (B) Expression levels of LIG4, cccDNA, and pgRNA in HBV gRNA–transduced
  HepG2‐hNTCP‐C4‐iCas9 cells 13 days after HBV inoculation (n = 4; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  siLIG4‐treated group vs. siNC‐treated group). (C) Expression levels of BRCA1, BRCA2,
  cccDNA, and pgRNA in HBV gRNA–transduced HepG2‐hNTCP‐C4‐iCas9 cells 13 days after
  HBV inoculation (n = 4; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, siBRCA1‐treated group or siBRCA2‐treated
  group vs. siNC‐treated group). BRCA, breast cancer susceptibility gene; LIG4, DNA
  Ligase 4.
