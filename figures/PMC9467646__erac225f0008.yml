caption: 'Proposed regulatory network for AMS. Tapetum regulatory pathway based on
  network published in . AMS is directly regulated by DYT1 through TDF1, and itself
  directly regulates MS188, which regulates MS1. AMS has a published role in sporopollenin
  wall formation alongside MS188. We propose that it is the loss of AMS in the early
  tapetum mutants that cause the phenotypes observed in ams, tdf1, and dyt1 mutants,
  as ms188 and ms1 develop normally. We have shown a novel role for AMS in the correct
  regulation of RMA localization (green lines in meiocytes) during telophase II, for
  correct cytokinesis, callose wall deposition (yellow material in meiocyte) to produce
  a functional tetrad. AMS is also important for fully functional tapetum cells that
  have a high energy requirement during meiosis (darker background colour represents
  this, and black circles indicate lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts) to provide
  for the developing pollen. We have shown that AMS appears to directly negatively
  regulate at least four meiosis-associated genes, possibly through interaction in
  the tapetum, and propose that AMS has a role in the final stages of meiosis through
  their regulation. n, nucleus; v, vacuole. Arrows: regulation; lines ending with
  a line: repression; lines ending with circle: protein interactions; dashed lines
  indicate a minor role in regulation of network (as predicted by modelling; ); red
  lines indicate a major role in regulation.'
