caption: iNOS mRNA levels and expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers (VICs)
  in CAVD. A, The mRNA expression levels in the 2 groups were examined by RT–qPCR.
  B, Correlation between iNOS mRNA levels and Sesn2, ALP, Runx2, and OPN mRNA levels.
  N = 10 for the normal group and 20 for the CAVD group. *P < 0.05 versus the normal
  group.
