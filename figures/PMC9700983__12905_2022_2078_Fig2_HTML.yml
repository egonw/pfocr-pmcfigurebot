caption: 'Pentamidine suppresses the migration and invasion of Ishikawa and HEC-1A
  cells. A, B Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were treated with DMSO or Pentamidine for
  the indicated time, cell migration capacity was detected by wound-healing assay.
  Representative images were shown. C, D Quantitative analysis of wounding-healing
  assay. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
  E Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were treated with the indicated concentrations Pentamidine
  for 24–36 h, the migration capacity were detected by Transwell migration assay.
  Representative images were photographed. Scar bar: 100 μm. Data are represented
  as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
  F Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were treated with Pentamidine for 24–36 h, the cell
  invasion ability were detected by Transwell invasion assay. Representative images
  were photographed. Scar bar: 100 μm. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation
  from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001'
