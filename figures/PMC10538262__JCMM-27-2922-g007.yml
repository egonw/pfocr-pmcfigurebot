caption: 'MTHFD2 expression was correlated with immune infiltration levels and PD‐L1
  (A, B) GO terms and the KEGG pathways of MTHFD2 in TCGA database. (C) The correlation
  of MTHFD2 expression with diverse immune cells infiltration levels in BC from TIMER
  database. (D) The correlation between MTHFD2 expression and immune checkpoint inhibitor
  target genes, including CD274, PDCD1 and CTLA4. (E) PD‐L1 surface‐antigen detection
  using immunofluorescent staining. (Scale bar represents 20 μm) (F) GSEA results
  of MTHFD2 in TCGA database. (G) WB analysis of MTHFD2, PD‐L1, and JAK/STAT signalling
  pathway‐related proteins expression. (* vs. shNC p < 0.05; ** vs. shNC p < 0.01;
  # vs. shNC+ IFN‐γ p < 0.05; ## vs. shNC+ IFN‐γ p < 0.01).'
