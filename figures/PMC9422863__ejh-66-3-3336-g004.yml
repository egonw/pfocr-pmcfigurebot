caption: Inhibition of APLN suppressed colony formation in esophageal cancer cells.
  APLN was knocked down in TE-1 and ECA-109 cells using APLN siRNA, then cells were
  seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 500 cells/well. Plates were photographed
  under microscope (A), and colonies were quantified (B); *p<0.05 compared to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
