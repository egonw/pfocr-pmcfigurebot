caption: The pathway enrichment bubble plot of differential lipid metabolites in the
  liver of juvenile American eels in PSPc0 group and PSPc900 group. Each bubble in
  the figure is the expression of influence combined with the p-value. Different bubbles
  represent different metabolic pathways, and the larger the bubble, the greater the
  influence of the pathway. Different colors indicate different degrees of metabolic
  pathways, and the darker the color, the greater the changes in pathways. A higher
  âˆ’log(p) means a lower p-value. According to the importance and influence of metabolic
  pathways, the names of the most relevant metabolic pathways were labeled.
