caption: FgErv14 is critical for DON production. (A) DON production level was determined
  in wheat grains infected with each strain. Error bars mean SDs. **, p < 0.01. (B)
  Relative expression folds of key genes in the DON biosynthetic pathway including
  TRI1, TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, and TRI10 were monitored by qRT-PCR in specified strains.
  The FgRPS16 gene served as the internal control. Error bars mean SDs. p values,
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. (C) Strains of PH-1 and the ΔFgerv14 expressing Tri4-GFP
  were observed under the induction of TBI medium. Fresh mycelia were observed using
  fluorescence microscopy. Bars, 10 μm.
