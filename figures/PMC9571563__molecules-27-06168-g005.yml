caption: The effects of ellagic acid on the health indexes of the wild-type nematodes
  N2. L4-stage worms were transferred onto NGM agar plates containing different concentrations
  of ellagic acid (0, 25, 50, and 100 μM). (A) The survival analysis of worms at different
  concentrations of ellagic acid, n > 100. (B) Total brood size showed the total number
  of eggs laid by each worm, n > 10. Each column represents the mean ± SD. (C) The
  motility of the nematodes was observed respectively on days 9, 13, and 17. The graph
  represents the ratio of different movement states in the nematodes treated with
  or without ellagic acid, n > 100. p < 0.001 (***).
