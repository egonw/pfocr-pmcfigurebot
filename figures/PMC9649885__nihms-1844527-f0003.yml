caption: A unified biosynthetic pathway for the anthraquinone-fused enediynes. Biosynthetic
  origin of TNM H (8) as revealed by [1-13C]- and [2-13C]-sodium acetate (bolded lines
  representing intact acetate units, circles representing C1 of acetate, diamonds
  representing C2 of acetate), as well as [methyl-13C]-L-methionine (triangle) feeding
  experiments (also see  and ). The C15 heptaene is the putative precursor for the
  biosynthesis of both the anthraquinone moiety and the 10-membered enediyne core
  of the anthraquinone-fused enediynes, as exemplified by 6, branching off prior to
  8, and by 1-5, branching off after the intermediacies of 8 and 11, with the concomitant
  loss of one carbon from the C15 precursor for both the anthraquinone moiety (i.e.,
  the thiolactone carbon) and the enediyne core (i.e., the aldehyde carbon). Each
  arrow represents multiple steps unless indicated by a single enzyme. The enediyne
  PKS (PKSE) is depicted with its phosphopantetheine arm as a wavy line.
