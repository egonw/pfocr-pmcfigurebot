caption: We note that the development set analysed numbers of data points (bottom
  left) are the same for all pathways with the exception of breast. we discovered
  during development that modest performance gains could be achieved by using just
  the 2WW breast pathway data for the breast algorithm, and using the data for all
  other pathways for each of the other eight algorithms (hence the same training data
  were used for all pathways except breast). 2WW, 2-week wait. GI, Gastrointestinal.
