caption: Transcriptome analysis for signaling pathways in primary and immortalized
  BMECs. (A) Hierarchical heat map showing the expression values for transcript mRNA
  in primary and immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Red indicates
  higher expression and green indicates lower expression. (B,C) KEGG pathway enrichment
  scatter diagram for differentially expressed genes. The range in the circle represents
  the number of differentially expressed genes in each pathway.
