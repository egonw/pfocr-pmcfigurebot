caption: (A) Proposed cathelicidins pathway believed to be implicated in the pathogenesis
  of rosacea. Production of LL-37 leads to several physiological effects including
  angiogenesis, vasodilation, inflammation, and matrix degradation. (i) High densities
  of Demodex folliculorum upregulates the expression of TLR2 in sebocytes. Enhanced
  TLR2 activity leads to increased KLK5 activity and production of LL-37. (ii) CagA+
  and VacA+ Helicobacter pylori strains stimulate mast cell activation and subsequent
  increase in histamines and prostaglandins, promoting inflammation. (iii) Through
  MMP2 upregulation and TLR2 signalling, ROS promote matrix degeneration and increase
  LL-37 production. (iv) UV promotes expression of CAMP in keratinocytes via vitamin
  D-dependent and ER stress-induced pathways. CAMP can then be cleaved into the bioactive
  LL-37 fragments. (B) Proposed inflammasome pathway believed to be implicated in
  the pathogenesis of rosacea. Inflammasome activation results in several physiological
  effects including chemotaxis of neutrophils, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The
  cathelicidins and inflammasome pathways are intricately linked. TLR2, toll-like
  receptor 2; KLK5, kallikrein-5; CagA+, cytotoxin-associated gene A positive; VacA+,
  vacuolating cytotoxin A positive; MMP2, matrix metalloprotease 2; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; UV, ultraviolet; CAMP, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum.
