caption: 'JAM-A regulates EVI1 through Hippo pathway molecules(A) EVI1 transcript
  levels in IEC isolated from the ileum of JAM-A−/− and WT mice were measured by qPCR.
  Evi1 transcript is upregulated in JAM-A−/− relative to WT mice. Relative expression
  of Evi1 is normalized to Tbp. Dots denote individual animals with data pooled from
  three independent experiments.(B) Evi1 transcript levels in IEC isolated from the
  ileum of JAM-AERΔIEC and JAM-Afl/fl mice were measured as in (A). Evi1 transcript
  is significantly upregulated in JAM-AERΔIEC mice relative to controls.(C) EVI1 is
  a downstream effector that significantly contributes to the JAM-A dimerization-deficient
  pro-proliferative IEC phenotype. The cellular proliferation of HEK293T cells overexpressing
  JAM-A-DL1 and JAM-A-WT was assessed by MTT assay. JAM-A-DL1 cells exhibit increased
  proliferation relative to the JAM-A-WT cells. EVI1 knockdown (EVI1 siRNA) in JAM-A-DL1
  overexpressing cells restored the proliferation to levels comparable to the JAM-A-WT
  cells. This result indicates that the increased proliferation observed in JAM-A-DL1
  mutants is dependent on EVI1 activity.(D) EVI1 knockdown (EVI1 siRNA) SKCO-15 IEC
  were subjected to an EdU incorporation assay to assess cell proliferation. Graph
  represents average percentage of EdU positive cells from 10 fields of view each
  for experiment. Three individual experiments were conducted, denoted by dots on
  the graph, which shows that EVI1 KD IEC exhibit decreased proliferation relative
  to control cells. Thus, EVI1 promotes proliferation in IEC. Representative western
  blot of SKCO-15 IEC transfected with EVI1 (EVI1) (2 targets: EVI1 siRNA-1, EVI1
  siRNA-2) or non-targeting control (CTL) siRNA. EVI1 is appreciably depleted in the
  EVI1 silenced cells. Calnexin serves as a loading control.(E) Evaluation of whether
  EVI1 is regulated by Hippo signaling. Representative western blots for EVI1 and
  NF2 in NF2 knockdown SKCO-15 cells (NF2 siRNA-1 and NF2 siRNA-2). Digital densitometry
  shows relative levels of EVI1 are increased by knockdown of NF2 relative to control
  IEC, confirming that the Hippo pathway suppresses EVI1. Actin served as a loading
  control.(F) Assessment of EVI1 protein levels in response to YAP inhibition. Representative
  EVI1 and JAM-A western blots from SKCO-15 cells treated with 10 μM of the YAP inhibitor
  verteporfin. Graph represents digital densitometry for EVI1 relative levels. Treatment
  with verteporfin resulted in significant reduction in EVI1 protein, suggesting that
  EVI1 is a YAP gene target. Actin served as a loading control.(G) Representative
  western blot for EVI1 in JAM-A KD and control SKCO-15 IEC treated with and without
  10 μM of verteporfin. Graphs represent digital densitometry for EVI1. The upregulation
  of EVI1 under JAM-A silencing was ablated in response to YAP inhibition revealing
  that regulation of EVI1 is modulated by YAP activity. Actin served as a loading
  control.(H) YAP pairs with TEAD transcription factors to target Evi1 transcription.
  Representative western blots for EVI1 and TEAD in TEAD1-4 KD (all four TEADs expressed
  in IEC were knocked down, two targets for each factor used: TEAD Target 1 and TEAD
  Target 2) SKCO-15 IEC. Actin serves as a loading control for western blot. Graph
  represents digital densitometry for EVI1, which is decreased by knockdown of TEAD
  transcription factors. Data for all experiments represent means ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. ∗p ≤ 0.05 ∗∗p ≤ 0.01 ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001: two-tailed Student’s t test and
