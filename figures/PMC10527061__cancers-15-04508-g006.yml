caption: 'ZFP64 activates the Notch1 signaling pathway by recruiting HDAC1 to inhibit
  NUMB expression. (A) Control or ZFP64 knocking down GBC-SD and NOZ cells were transfected
  with vector or HDAC1 overexpressing plasmid for 24 h, and the NUMB protein expression
  levels were determined using Western blot assays. (B,C) Control or ZFP64 overexpressing
  GBC-SD and NOZ cells were transfected with shRNA plasmid of HDAC1 or corresponding
  empty plasmid. Western blot was used to detect the expression of NUMB (B) and the
  key molecules of Notch1 signaling pathway (C). (D) Immunofluorescence was performed
  to examine the expression level of NICD in nucleus. NICD: green fluorescent; DAPI-stained
  nuclei: blue fluorescent. All data were assessed using one-way ANOVA, as mean Â±
  SD, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001. See  for original western blots.'
