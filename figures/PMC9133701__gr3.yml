caption: SMAD3 was negatively regulated by miR-423-5p in GC. (A) starBase and targetscan
  online tools showed the predicted sites between miR-423-5p and SMAD3. (B) Luciferase
  reporter experiments measured the relative luciferase activity. (C–D) RT-PCR measured
  the regulations of miR-423-5p alteration on the SMAD3 in mRNA level in GC cells.
  (E) Pearson's association analysis was performed in starBase v3.0 in 372 gastric
  cancer samples. (F–G) GEPIA visualized the relative expression of SMAD3 in GC tissues
  with para-tumor tissues as control. Further, the disease-free survival analysis
  was performed. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001, versus NC. All experiments were repeated for three
  times. Mean and sd values were shown in the subfigures.
