caption: "The metabolic mechanism of EPS biosynthesis in B. licheniformis. The metabolic
  pathway was reconstructed based on BioCyc and KEGG analyses. Transcripts of B. licheniformis
  CGMCC 2876 and OEK1 are shown aside the pathway as a heat map based on fpkm in the
  transcriptome data. Note: (\uFEFFβ-D-GlcA-(1 → 4)-β-D-GlcA-(1 → 3)-α-D-GalNAc-(1 → 6)-α-D-GalNAc-PP-Und
  represents \uFEFFβ-d-glucuronosyl-(1 → 4)-β-d-glucuronosyl-(1 → 3)-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosaminyl-(1 → 6)-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosaminyl-diphospho-ditrans,
  octacis-undecaprenol)."
