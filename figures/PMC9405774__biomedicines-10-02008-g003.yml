caption: 'CARD14 expression correlates with DNA repair gene enrichment. (A) Gene ontology
  analysis for enrichment of biological processes on all genes whose expression showed
  a significant correlation with CARD14 expression based on gene expression (RSEM)
  in TCGA prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) patients. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis
  for enrichment of the Hallmark DNA repair gene set in genes ranked by positive correlation
  with CARD14 expression in TCGA PRAD patients (NES: Normalised Enrichment Score,
  FDR: False Discovery Rate). (C) Pearson correlation analysis between DNA damage
  response (DDR) pathway activity and CARD14 expression in TCGA PRAD patients. (Dâ€“G)
  CARD14 mRNA expression as a function of disease progression after radiotherapy (D),
  fraction genome altered (E), microsatellite instability (F) and aneuploidy score
  (G) in PCa patients, based on TCGA data. p value in (D) was generated by Welch t-test,
  * p < 0.05.'
