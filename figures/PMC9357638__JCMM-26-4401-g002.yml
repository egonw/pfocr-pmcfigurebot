caption: Effect of ANKRD49 on MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 expression, their enzyme activities,
  and the expression and activity of ATF‐2 transcription factor in A549 cells. (A)
  Expression levels of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 mRNAs measured by q‐RT‐PCR in ANKRD49 OE A549
  cells and their vector control cells. Data were calculated using 2−ΔΔCt  relative
  quantitative analysis. (B) Protein levels of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in ANKRD49 OE A549
  cells or their vector control cells as determined by Western blot analysis. β‐Actin
  was used as the loading control. (C) Expression levels of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 mRNAs
  were measured by q‐RT‐PCR in A549 cells stably transfected with ANKRD49 KD702, ANKRD49
  KD829, and their shcontrol. Data were calculated using 2−ΔΔCt relative quantitative
  analysis. (D) Protein levels of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in A549 cells stably transfected
  with ANKRD49 KD702, ANKRD49 KD829, and their shcontrol as determined by Western
  blot analysis. The knockdown effect of ANKRD49 and β‐Actin was measured using the
  same PVDF membrane and presented in Figure A. (E) Enzyme activities of MMP‐2 and
  MMP‐9 were detected by gelatin zymography. (F) Grey value of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in
  ANKRD49 OE A549 cells and ANKRD49 KD A549 cells. (G) Scratch healing analysis of
  ANKRD49 overexpression on A549 cell migration in the presence or absence of the
  MMP inhibitor (ilomastat) in 72 h. (H) Protein levels of ERK, p‐ERK, JNK, p‐JNK,
  P38 and p‐P38 determined in ANKRD49 OE A549 cells and their vector control cells
  by Western blot analysis. β‐Actin was used as loading control. (I) Levels of protein
  expression for p‐ATF‐2, ATF‐2, p‐P38, P38, MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 as determined by Western
  blot in ANKRD49 OE A549 cells and their vector control cells in the presence of
  a P38/MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) or its absence (DMSO). β‐Actin was used as loading
  control. (J) Protein levels of p‐ATF‐2 and ATF‐2 determined in ANKRD49 OE A549 cells
  and their vector control cells by Western blot analysis. (K) Protein levels of p‐ATF‐2
  and ATF‐2 in A549 cells stably transfected with ANKRD49 KD702, ANKRD49 KD829, and
  their shcontrol as determined by Western blot analysis. β‐Actin was used as loading
  control. (L) Effect of ATF‐2 downregulation by RNA interference on MMP‐2 and MMP‐9
  expression as determined by Western blot analysis in ANKRD49 OE A549 cells infected
  with lentivirus shatf2b or its vector control shatfNC. GAPDH was used as loading
  control. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001, and
  ****p < 0.0001. (M) Protein levels of ATF‐2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus compartments
  of ANKRD49 OE A549 cells and their vector control cells as determined by Western
  blot analysis. GAPDH was used as cytoplasm loading control. LaminB was used as nucleus
  loading control
