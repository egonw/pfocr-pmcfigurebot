caption: ST3GAL3 promoted the proliferation of MH7A cells. (a, b) After MH7A cells
  were transfected with ST3GAL3 overexpression plasmid or ST3GAL3 siRNA, qRT-PCR was
  performed to show the gene expression of ST3GAL3. (c, d) Western blotting analysis
  was performed to show the protein expression of ST3GAL3. (e, f) MTT assay showed
  that ST3GAL3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, while si-ST3GAL3 inhibited
  cell proliferation. (g, h) Western blotting analysis showed that the overexpression
  of ST3GAL3 promoted the protein expression of cyclinD, cyclinE, and PCNA, while
  si-ST3GAL3 inhibited the expression of those proteins. n = 3. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the indicated group.
