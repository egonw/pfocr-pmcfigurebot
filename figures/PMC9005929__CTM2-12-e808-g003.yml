caption: PIM1 variants, structure, and interaction analysis of mutations. (A) The
  number of PIM1 variant classifications detected. (B) Counts of PIM1 variant types
  detected. (C) Summary of PIM1 base substitutions. (D) Variants of PIM1 per mutant
  patient. (E) Schematic representation of the domain structure and locations of the
  somatic mutations within PIM1 observed. The lines represent the position of the
  mutations. (F) Co‐mutational and mutually exclusive patterns in gene pairs based
  on the top 50 most frequently mutated genes. The green squares represent co‐occurring
  mutations, and pink represent mutually exclusive mutations. The intensity of the
  color is correspondent to the ‐log10 (p‐value). (G) Significant examples of co‐occurring
  mutations (PIM1 and SETD1B, PIM1 and CD79B) and mutual exclusivity (PIM1 and SPEN).
  (H) Overview of the distinct profiles of mutant PIM1 and wild‐type PIM1 diffuse
  large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Each column represents one sample, and each line
  represents one gene. Genes (in rows) are grouped according to their involvement
  in the signalling pathway with a color code and ordered according to their mutation
  frequencies within each group
