caption: Screening of target genes involved in the reversal of drug resistance by
  ubenimex. (A) Heat map was generated using R package to depict transcripts that
  were significantly differentially expressed in MKN-45/X cells after ubenimex treatment.
  The green and red colors indicate up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts, respectively.
  (B) Through HCS experiment, the RI value fold changes of MKN-45/X cells after overexpression
  or silencing of related genes were evaluated. (C) The column graph shows the changes
  in the RIs fold change after silencing of the 16 genes. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
  (D) GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the above genes. Ube, ubenimex;
  RI, resistance index; FDR, false discovery rate; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; HCS, high content screening.
