caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  of genes on the brown and blue modules. (a) A bubble plot indicating the enrichment
  of 119 genes of the brown module in the top 20 KEGG signaling pathways. Labels of
  the Y-axis show the pathways, and the X-axis corresponds to the gene ratio (number
  of input genes/number of all genes involved in the pathway). The color of the bubble
  indicates the enrichment significance, and the size of the bubble represents the
  number of genes enriched in the pathway. (b) Same as in (a). The plot displays the
  enrichment of 130 genes of the blue module in the 15 KEGG signaling pathways. Labels
  of the Y-axis show the pathways, and the X-axis corresponds to the gene ratio (number
  of input genes/number of all genes involved in the pathway). The color of the bubble
  indicates the enrichment significance, and the size of the bubble represents the
  number of genes enriched in the pathway. (c) A heatmap of 119 genes of the brown
  module that are enriched in the top 20 KEEG signaling pathways. A colored cell indicates
  that the genes (X-axis) are enriched in the corresponding pathway (Y-axis). (d)
  A heatmap of 130 genes of the blue module that are enriched in the 15 KEEG signaling
  pathways. A colored cell indicates that the genes (X-axis) are enriched in the corresponding
  pathway (Y-axis). A p-value < 0.05 and an FDR (adjusted p-value) < 0.01 were considered
  statistically significant for all cases.
