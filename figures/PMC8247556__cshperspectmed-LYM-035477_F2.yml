caption: Simplified overview of metabolic pathways in leukemia and lymphoma. Altered
  and/or enhanced glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), serine biosynthetic
  pathway, folate/one-carbon cycles, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS), lipid synthesis, and amino acid (AA) metabolism support bioenergetics
  (red), biomass accumulation (green), redox balance (blue), and differentiation blockade
  (purple). Most precursors, products, cofactors, and enzymes are intentionally absent
  for simplicity. (ATP) Adenosine triphosphate, (GTP) guanosine triphosphate, (NAD)
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, (NADPH) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
  (SAM) S-adenosyl methionine, (Î±KG) alpha-ketoglutarate, (GSH) reduced glutathione.
