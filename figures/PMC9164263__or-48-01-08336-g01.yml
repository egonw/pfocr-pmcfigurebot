caption: Identification of upregulated hub genes in MB following enrichment analysis
  and protein-protein interaction network construction. (A) Volcano plots illustrating
  upregulated DEGs (red dots) and downregulated DEGs (blue dots) identified in the
  three datasets with the criteria of adjusted P<0.05 and |log2FC| ≥1 (–). (B) Venn
  diagram of overlapping upregulated or downregulated DEGs among three datasets. (C-E)
  GO analysis of upregulated DEGs presents the top 10 significant terms of GO analysis
  in (C) biological process, (D) molecular function, and (E) celluar component. (F)
  Significant KEGG pathway enrichment terms. (G) The PPI network was constructed with
  upregulated genes. Red circular nodes represent the top 10 hub genes. MB, medulloblastoma;
  DEGs, differentially upregulated genes; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
