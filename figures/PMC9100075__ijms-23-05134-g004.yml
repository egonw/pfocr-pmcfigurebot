caption: Profiling of intracellular signaling and the selection of hub proteins in
  HeLa cells treated with H-CM or N-CM. Intracellular proteins up- (red) and down-regulated
  (blue) (>2-fold) [] in HeLa cells treated with H-CM compared with N-CM, as identified
  by a protein antibody array analysis (A). Biological process terms from the GO analysis
  of proteins down-regulated in HeLa cells treated with H-CM compared with N-CM (B).
  The KEGG pathway analysis [] of proteins down-regulated in HeLa cells treated with
  H-CM compared with N-CM (C). PPI network [,] of intracellular proteins up- and down-regulated
  in HeLa cells treated with H-CM compared with N-CM (D). The biological process terms
  from the GO analysis of hub proteins down-regulated in HeLa cells treated with H-CM
  compared with N-CM (E). The KEGG pathway [] analysis of hub proteins down-regulated
  in HeLa cells treated with H-CM compared with N-CM (F). The data for the GO and
  KEGG pathway results [] are represented as the −log10 (p-value) (p < 0.01). Red,
  up-regulated proteins; blue, down-regulated proteins; PPI, protein–protein interaction;
  N-CM, conditioned medium from normoxic HDFs; H-CM, conditioned medium from hypoxic
  HDFs. Image in (A) was produced using MeV v 4.9.0 (J.Craig Venter Institute). Images
  in (B,C,E,F) were produced using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 (GraphPad Software).
  Image in (D) was produced using Cytoscape-STRING v 1.5.0 (NIGMS, Bethesda, MA, USA).
