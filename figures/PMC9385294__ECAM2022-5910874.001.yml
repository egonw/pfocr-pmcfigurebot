caption: 'Identification of exosomes isolated from BMSCs. (a)-(b) The levels of exosome-specific
  markers, including CD9, CD63, CD81, and TSG101 in BMSCs, supernatant, and exosomes
  were measured by western blot analysis. ∗P < 0.05. (c) The exosome morphology was
  determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (scale bar: 100 nm). (d) The
  particle size of exosomes was detected by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA).
  Data from at least three independent experiments were presented as mean ± SD ∗P
  < 0.05.'
