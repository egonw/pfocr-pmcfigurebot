caption: Effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on the colony formation in soft agar in the
  presence of 5-Fluorouracil. The effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on the colony formation
  in soft agar were examined. Red squares = MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells, blue circles
  = MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 cells. IC50 is indicated with a purple dotted line and IC25
  is indicated with a green dotted line. IC25 is a term to indicate inhibition of
  colony formation at 25%. These experiments were repeated performed and similar results
  were observed. The colonies for each cell line were normalized to untreated cells
  so that the results from the MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN and MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 could be
  compared. **P < 0.005.

  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
