caption: 'Curcumin inhibits the ER stress and the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway activated by
  DHT in the ovarian GCs. Curcumin-treated GCs were induced by DHT/TM. (a–d) Round
  coverslips of ovarian GCs were immunostained for revealing p-IRE1α and XBP1 expression
  levels (green) as indicated. The slides were counterstained with DAPI (blue), and
  the images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Three independent
  experiments were performed with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM.
  ∗∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.05 vs. DMSO group; ##p < 0.05 vs. DHT group.'
