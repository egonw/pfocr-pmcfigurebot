caption: 'Cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion induced more severe damage under diabetes.
  (a) Diagram of the T2DM mouse model establishment. (b) Continuous measurement of
  FPG levels and weight in diabetic mice and nondiabetic mice starting at high-fat
  diet feeding (4 weeks of age). (c) Left, representative images of LSCI measurement
  showing CBF changes during MCAO model construction (white frames refer to the MCA
  supply area, scale bar: 1 mm). Right, the CBF fractional changes at the timepoint
  of baseline, MCA blocking and reperfusion (n = 3). (d) TTC-stained slices from non-DM
  mice and DM mice in the sham and MCAO groups, and the bar graph shows ipsilateral
  infarct size of each group (n = 6 in each group). (e) The neurological deficit scores
  of the non-DM mice and DM mice in the sham and MCAO groups (n = 6 in the non-DM
  and DM sham groups, n = 10 in the non-DM and DM MCAO groups). (f) Representative
  immunofluorescence images that microglia (IBA-1, green) expressed TLR4 (red) and
  NLRP3 (white) colocalization (scale bar: 9.94 μm, magnification: 640x). ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
