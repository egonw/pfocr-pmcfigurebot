caption: Association of gene enrichment and therapy response to immune TNBC immunotypes.
  A-B. Barplot showing gene enrichment of (A) BIOCARTA and (B) Reactome pathways using
  Enrichr tool (see Methods) in Immunotype-1. C. Schematic showing TCR and downstream
  signalling that effects immune cell types based on data curated from the Indian
  TNBC gene expression, pathway analysis in (A-B) and literature. D. Multiomics enrichment
  analysis validation specific pathways from (C) using TCGA TNBC samples (n=18). Kruskal-Wallis
  statistical test was performed for p-value significance. E. Boxplot showing differential
  T-cell-inflammed gene expression profile (GEP) in immunotypes in the Indian cohort
  (n=88). F. Kaplan-Meier curve and median survival data showing differential OS in
  melanoma samples (pre-treatment; Mariathasan et al. ; n=348) with high and low enrichment
  of Immunotype-1 genes and their association with immunotherapy response. Log-rank
  test was performed for p-value significance. G. Barplot showing the association
  of immune immunotypes with clinical RECIST response to immunotherapy in melanoma
  (Mariathasan et al. ; n=298). * - represents a significant (p<0.05; Kruskal-Wallis
  test) enrichment in samples with high Immunotype-1 score compared to those with
  low score. H. Boxplot showing differential MAGEA3 therapy response signature in
  immunotypes in the Indian cohort (n=88). I. Proportion of melanoma samples (n=56;
  GSE35640) showing immune TNBC immunotypes with differential MAGEA3 therapy response,
  as a cross-cancer comparison analysis. Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was performed
  for p-value significance for (E) and (H). Chi-squared test was performed for p-value
  calculations for (G) and (I).
