caption: Schematic showing the regulatory mechanism of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway.
  Under normal physiological conditions, the Keap1 dimer binds to two binding motifs,
  called DLG and ETGE, in a specific domain of Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to be sequestered
  in the cell membrane and maintained at low levels by Keap1-dependent ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. Under oxidative stress, such as the presence of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), the conformation of Keap1 changes, resulting in the release
  of Nrf2 from Keap1-directed degradation, which translocates in the nucleus and forms
  a dimer in sMAF. The polymer formed leads to the induction of ARE-dependent genes
  such as Sod, Cat, Gpx, and Gcl. These gene products subsequently exert cytoprotection
  against ROS. Ub, ubiquitin.
