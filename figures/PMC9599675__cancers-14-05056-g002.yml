caption: Schematic diagram of the LSR ligand-induced transient macropinocytosis derived
  from intercellular split. (Upper panels) In mature epithelial cells, LSR accumulates
  in apical tricellular junctions. Administration of the LSR ligand splits the adjacent
  intercellular spaces, leading to macropinocytosis. The intercellular adhesion apparatus
  was not disrupted by macropinocytosis. G, intercellular gap; TJ, tight junctions;
  AJ, adherens junctions; D, desmosomes; N, nucleus; Mt, mitochondria. Bar, 1 Î¼m.
  (Lower panels) The gap between adjacent cells expanded and filled with extracellular
  fluid, one hour after administration of the LSR ligand. Two hours after addition,
  numerous macropinosomes that incorporated the extracellular fluid appeared in the
  cytosol. The vesicles disappeared three hours after addition. The cells then initiated
  malignant cell growth, resulting in multilayered cell growth. This pathway was suppressed
  in the presence of a macropinocytosis inhibitor.
