caption: LIGHT in intestinal inflammation. The physiologic function of the LTβR pathway
  maintains the organization of secondary lymphoid organs (Peyer’s patches, spleen,
  lymph nodes) and also plays a key role in formation of tertiary lymphoid structures
  at sites of persistent inflammation. Innate pathogen-sensing receptors stimulate
  neutrophil and NK cell secretion of LIGHT at sites of inflammation. LIGHT activates
  LTβR to differentiate stromal cells into an immune niche favoring activation of
  antigen-presenting macrophages (MAC) and dendritic cells (DC) to recruit T and B
  cells. LIGHT activates the HVEM pathway to promote rapid recall responses and formation
  of germinal centers where T follicular helper cells (Tfh) promote antibody production
  by B cells. In patients with IBD, persistent intestinal inflammation may occur from
  a reinforcing cycle of LIGHT secretion by innate effector cells following disruption
  in the integrity of the mucosal epithelial barrier and re-exposure of T cells to
  self-antigens.
