caption: NAD+ exposure induces the apoptosis of aNSPCs. (A) Representative images
  of activated caspase3 immunostaining with Ctrl and NAD+-treated aNSPCs under proliferation
  conditions. Scale bar, 50 μm. (B) Quantification results show that NAD+ exposure
  increased the percentage of activated caspase3+ cells. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test. (C,D) Western blot assay
  (C) and quantification results (D) show that NAD+ exposure increased the protein
  level of activated caspase3. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiments, unpaired t-test; ***, p < 0.001.
