caption: 'Overexpression of CD36 inhibited CXCL3 secretion of gastric cancer cells
  and impaired T cell function. A Western blot analysis of BATF2, MYB and T cell effector
  molecules (PRF1, GZMB, TNF, IFNG) in Jurkat T cells co-cultured with CD36 overexpressed
  or knock-downed gastric cancer cells. The experiment was repeated three times. B
  qPCR analysis of BATF2, MYB and T cell effector genes (PRF1, GZMB, TNF, IFNG) in
  Jurkat T cells co-cultured with CD36 overexpressed or knock-downed gastric cancer
  cells, n=3. Statistical analyses: Two-way ANOVA and Dunnett''s multiple comparisons
  test, Two-way ANOVA and Šídák''s multiple comparison test. C, D After co-culturing
  with T cells, gastric cancer cells AGS and HGC-27 with CD36 overexpression and knockdown
  exhibited different abilities in colony formation. Relative colony numbers were
  counted and shown in H, n = 3. Statistical analyses: Two-way ANOVA and Dunnett''s
  multiple comparisons test, Two-way ANOVA and Šídák''s multiple comparison test.
  E CCK-8 assays showed after co-culturing with T cells, gastric cancer cells AGS
  and HGC-27 with CD36 overexpression and knockdown exhibited different abilities
  in proliferation. Statistical analyses: Two-way ANOVA and Dunnett''s multiple comparisons
  test, Two-way ANOVA and Šídák''s multiple comparison test. F Comparison of qPCR
  titers of CXCL3 mRNA in gastric cells AGS and HGC-27 with CD36 overexpression and
  knockdown, n=3. Statistical analyses: Unpaired two-tailed Student''s t-test or One-way
  ANOVA and Dunnett''s multiple comparisons test. G The CXCL3 protein levels in supernatant
  of gastric cancer cells, n=3. Statistical analyses: Unpaired two-tailed Student''s
  t-test or One-way ANOVA and Dunnett''s multiple comparisons test. H Western blot
  analysis of BATF2, MYB and T cell effector molecules (PRF1, GZMB, IFNG, and TNF)
  in Jurkat cells co-cultured with normal AGS, CD36 over-expressed AGS, CD36 over-expressed
  AGS adding CXCL3 (10 ng/ml) and CD36 over-expressed AGS adding CXCL3 (10 ng/ml)
  and SB225002 (12.5 μm) for 24 h. The experiment was repeated three times. I qPCR
  analysis of BATF2, MYB and T cell effector molecules (PRF1, GZMB, IFNG, and TNF)
  in groups of H, n = 3. Statistical analyses: Two-way ANOVA and Dunnett''s multiple
  comparisons test, Two-way ANOVA and Šídák''s multiple comparison test. J Proposed
  schematic of CD36-CXCL3-BATF2\MYB signaling pathway regulatory mechanisms in activating
  T cells. Under the stimulation of a high-fat diet and Helicobacter pylori infection,
  CD36 receptors on gastric cancer cells were upregulated. This led to a reduction
  in the secretion of CXCL3. As a consequence, the transcription of T cell effector
  molecules PRF1, GZMB, IFNG, and TNF by the BATF2-MYB complex was affected, resulting
  in the suppression of CD4+ memory T cell activation. This finally impaired its suppression
  on proliferation ability of tumor cells. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, *** p<0.001.'
