caption: 'PTX3 mediates the prometastatic effect of TNFAIP6 in GC (a) the SGC7901
  or MGC803 cell is cotransfected with TNFAIP6 siRNA and PTX3 overexpression plasmid
  (OE-PTX3), (b) the clone formation assay is based on cotransfected GC cells, (c)
  the invasion assay based on cotransfected GC cells(∗∗P < 0.01 compared with vector
  and ##P < 0.01 compared with si-TNFAIP6).'
