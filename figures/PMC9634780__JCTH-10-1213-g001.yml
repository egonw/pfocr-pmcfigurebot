figure_title: Schematic explanation main drivers and mechanism contributing to sarcopenia
  in patients with liver cirrhosis
caption: Sarcopenia in chronic liver disease is a multifactorial disorder with a complex
  pathophysiology associated with a dysregulated muscle protein turnover. Numerous
  factors such as hyperammonemia, hypogonadism, impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, and depleted glycogen stores are involved in the pathophysiology
  of sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia contributed by decreased hepatic mass,
  portosystemic shunt, and gut dysbiosis lead to an increased myostatin expression,
  cataplerosis of Î±-ketoglutarate, altered integrated stress response, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction, resulting in impaired muscles protein synthesis as well as increased
  muscles autophagy. Hypogonadism and impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling in cirrhosis
  also result in increased myostatin expression. Depleted glycogen stores and an accelerated
  starvation in patients with liver cirrhosis lead to increased gluconeogenesis resulting
  in a low concentration of skeletal muscle amino acids (BCAA) contributing to sarcopenia.
  Physical inactivity, pro-inflammatory cytokines and poor insulin/IGF-1 transmission
  can all activate UPP, causing increased muscles protein breakdown. BCAA, branch
  chain amino acid; GH, growth hormone; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IL-interleukin;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Mt, mitochondrial; NH3, ammonia; O2, oxygen; TNF, tumor
  necrotic factor; UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
