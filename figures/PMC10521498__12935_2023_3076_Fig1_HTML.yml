caption: High expression of DIO3OS was a risk factor of overall survival and the validation
  and expression of DIO3OS in osteosarcoma cell lines. A 465 overlap overall survival
  risk genes between TARGET datasets and GSE39055. B 374 overlap overall survival
  protective genes between TARGET datasets and GSE39055. C 1 overlap overall survival
  risk lincRNAs between TARGET datasets and GSE39055. D 0 overlap overall survival
  protective lincRNAs between TARGET datasets and GSE39055. E The effect of high DIO3OS
  expression on the prognosis of osteosarcoma overall survival (OS) is statistically
  significant in TARGET cohort. F The effect of high DIO3OS expression on the prognosis
  of osteosarcoma overall survival (OS) is statistically significant in GSE39055.
  G Time-dependent ROC curves, 1-Year (AUC = 0.572), 3-Year (AUC = 0.606), 5-Year
  (AUC = 0.634). H Time-dependent ROC curves, 1-Year (AUC = 0.750), 3-Year (AUC = 0.650),
  5-Year (AUC = 0.639). I Compared with normal osteoblast, DIO3OS is significantly
  higher expressed in osteosarcoma. J In the TARGET cohort, DIO3OS high and low expression
  groups showed significant differential genes between the two groups in the form
  of a volcano map. K The TARGET data set showed the significant differential genes
  between the two groups in the form of a heat map. (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **,
