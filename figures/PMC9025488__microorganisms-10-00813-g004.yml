caption: Metabolic pathways of Brucella. Major metabolic pathways of Brucella and
  examples of substrates fueling this metabolic network, as described in . The pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), the Embden-Meyer-Parnas (EMP) pathway, the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, and the urea cycle (UC) are conserved in Brucella. Only a subset
  of Brucella species harbor an active Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP) that correlates
  with an active phosphogluconate dehydratase (Edd) enzyme converting gluconate-6-phosphate
  into 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate. Solid lines represent direct substrate
  conversion by a single enzymatic reaction, whereas dashed lines illustrate multistep
  conversions of substrates with the involvement of several, subsequent enzymatic
  reactions. Transporters involved in translocation of indicated substrates from the
  periplasm across the inner membrane (IM) into the cytoplasm of Brucella are displayed
  schematically. Acetyl-CoA—acetyl coenzyme A; GABA—gamma-aminobutyric acid; CO2—carbon
  dioxide; HCO3−—bicarbonate; H2S—hydrogen sulfide; NADP—Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; NH3—ammonia; SO42−—sulfate. Created with BioRender.com.
