caption: 'Schematic model showing the role of BinCARD1 in the replication cycle of
  IAV. BinCARD1 interacts with IAV NP and enhances the interaction between NP and
  IMP α7, thereby facilitating the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized
  NP. In contrast, the role played by BinCARD1 in promoting IAV replication is counteracted
  by the host defense system: BinCARD1-mediated Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of
  TRAF3 favors the activation of the RIG-I innate immune signaling pathway, and polyubiquitinated
  BinCARD1 is subjected to selective autophagic degradation via the TBK1-p62 axis'
article_title: Influenza A virus use of BinCARD1 to facilitate the binding of viral
  NP to importin α7 is counteracted by TBK1-p62 axis-mediated autophagy.
