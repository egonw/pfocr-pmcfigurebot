caption: DHCE inhibited migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. (A) The wound
  healing assay of MGC803 and SGC7901 cells. After making a linear wound, cells were
  treated with DHCE (0, 1, 2, or 4 μM) diluted with serum-free RPMI-1640 for 24 h.
  The photographs were captured at 0 and 24 h under an inverted microscope with a
  magnification of 100×. The wound area was measured, and the migration potential
  of each group was quantified. (B) Trans-well migration and invasion assay of MGC803
  and SGC7901 cells. Images were photographed using an inverted microscope under a
  magnification of 200×. The number of invading cells were counted, and the migration
  and invasion potentials of each group were quantified. The experiment was carried
  out in triplicate, and the statistical results are expressed as the means ± SD (*
  p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group).
