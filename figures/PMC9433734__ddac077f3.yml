caption: 'The colocalization of NMNAT3 and TH was decreased in the SN of Parkinson’s
  disease subjects. The localizations of NMNAT3, TH and GFAP were imaged using dual-label
  confocal microscopy. Target proteins were detected using a combination of specific
  primary and fluorescent secondary antibodies, with TH and GFAP imaged using AlexaFluor488
  and NMNAT3 imaged using AlexaFluor594. Areas of interest are magnified. Arrow heads
  indicate areas of colocalization. Scale bar = 50 μm. Colocalization between NMNAT3
  and both TH and GFAP was assessed using the EzColocalization plug-in v1.1.3 in FIJI
  Image-J v1.53a and expressed as TOS and Mander’s coefficients, using Coste’s thresholds.
  For all panels: TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein;
  NMNAT3, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase3; SN, substantia nigra;
  NCD, non-disease controls; PD, Parkinson’s disease; TOS, threshold overlap score;
  M1 and M2, Mander’s coefficients; * = P < 0.05; n/s, not significant.'

  that can be rescued by targeting the NAD+ pathway.
