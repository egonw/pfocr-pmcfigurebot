caption: Effects of MFE on gut metabolites. (A) Partial least-squares discriminant
  analysis (PLS-DA) of metabolites of three groups (CON, HF, and MFE). (B) Heat map
  for metabolite enrichment change analysis (Top50) of three groups. (C) Phylogenetic
  tree of correlation between samples of metabolites in three groups (CON, HF, and
  MFE). (D) The pathway enrichment analysis of metabolites. (E) KEGG map shows metabolites
  in enriched pathways. Data are shown as mean ± SD. (For each group, n = 10).
