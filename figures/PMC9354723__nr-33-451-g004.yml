caption: 'Involvement of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in the NGR1-induced inhibition
  of oxidative stress after SCI. (a–c) Quantitative analysis of MDA, SOD, GSH-PX in
  the Sham + vehicle, SCI + vehicle, SCI + NGR1, and SCI + NGR1 + ML385 groups at
  14 days after SCI. N = 5. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. One-way analysis of
  ANOVA with Turkey’s post hoc tests was used. *P < 0.05 vs. the Sham + vehicle group;
  #P < 0.05 vs. the SCI + vehicle group; &P < 0.05 vs. the SCI + NGR1 group. ANOVA,
  analysis of variance; GSH-PX, glutathione peroxidase activity; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1;
  MDA, malonaldehyde; NGR1, notoginsenoside R1; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related
  factor 2; SCI, spinal cord injury; SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
article_title: Notoginsenoside R1 alleviates spinal cord injury by inhibiting oxidative
  stress, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammation via activating the nuclear factor erythroid
  2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway.
