caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of (a) combined phosphoproteomic analysis following
  EGFR ASO 16, 18, and 21 treatment compared with standard ASO control (STD) in PC9
  cells reveals inhibition of cell cycle and transcription and upregulation of apoptosis
  and EGFR (Erbb1) downstream pathways. Comparable pathway enrichment was observed
  following (b) direct inhibition of EGFR using erlotinib treated relative to STD.
  Analysis was performed using the DE proteins. Figures represent pathways that are
  formed only using upregulated DE proteins (red) and downregulated DE proteins (blue).
  All pathways were selected based on negative log10 P values >10.
