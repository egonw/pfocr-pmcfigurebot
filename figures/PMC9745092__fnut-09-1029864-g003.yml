caption: Conjugated linoleic acid promoted fat deposition in liver and the quadriceps
  femoris of mice. (A,B) The liver tissues and quadriceps femoris muscles of mice
  were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Frozen slides were made from these tissues and
  then stained with oil red O (magnification:200X). (C) The IMF content in the quadriceps
  femoris of mice was determined by the Soxhlet extraction method. Data in panel (C)
  were analyzed by t-test. *P < 0.05.
article_title: Conjugated linoleic acid regulates adipocyte fatty acid binding protein
  expression via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α signaling pathway and
  increases intramuscular fat content.
