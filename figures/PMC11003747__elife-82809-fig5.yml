figure_title: Effects of mTOR pathway manipulation in low mTOR cohort
caption: '(A) Representative western blot: treatment of Family-1 neural precursor
  cells (NPCs) with SC-79 increases p-S6 levels in I-ASD-1 but not Sib-1 with no changes
  in total S6. (B) Graph: SC-79 vs Veh: increases p-S6/S6 levels in I-ASD-1 but not
  in Sib-1. (C) SC-79 treatment rescues neurite outgrowth in low mTOR I-ASD-1 NPCs
  without affecting Sib-1 NPC neurites. (D) SC-79 treatment rescues migration in low
  mTOR I-ASD-1 NPCs without affecting Sib-1 NPC neurites. (E) Representative western
  blot: MK-2206 treatment of Family-1 NPCs decreases p-S6 in Sib-1 but not I-ASD-1
  with no changes in total S6. (F) Graph: MK-2206 vs Veh: decreases PS6 in Sib-1 but
  not I-ASD-1. (G) MK-2206 treatment reduces neurite outgrowth in Sib-1 to the level
  of I-ASD-1 without affecting I-ASD-1 neurite outgrowth. (H) MK-2206 treatment reduces
  migration in Sib-1 to the level of I-ASD-1 without affecting I-ASD-1. (I) Proof
  of principle western blot showing that SC-79 increases p-S6 levels in I-ASD-3 but
  not in Sib-3. (J) SC-79 treatment of low mTOR I-ASD-3 increases neurite outgrowth
  to the level of Sib-3. (K) Proof of principle western blot showing that MK-2206
  decreases p-S6 in Sib-3 without affecting I-ASD-3 p-S6 levels. (L) Treatment of
  Sib-3 NPCs with MK-2206 reduces neurite outgrowth to the level of I-ASD-3. For all
  graphs: p≤0.05 = *, p≤ 0.01 = **, p≤0.001 = ***, p≤0.0001 = ****, two-way ANOVA.
