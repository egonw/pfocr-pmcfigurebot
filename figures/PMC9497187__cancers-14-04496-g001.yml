caption: (A) Schematic showing the sphingolipid metabolic pathway where serine palmitoyl
  transferase (SPT1–2), 3–Ketosphinganine reductase (KDSR), Dihydroceramide desaturase
  (DEGS1–2), Ceramide synthases (CERS1–6), Ceramide transferase (CERT), Ceramide 1-phosphate
  phosphatase (C1PP), N–Acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (ASAH1, ASAH2), Alkaline ceramidase
  (ACER1, ACER3), Sphingosine–1–phosphate kinase (SPHK1, 2), Sphingosine–1–phosphate
  phosphatase (S1PP), Sphingosine–1–phosphate lyase (S1PL), Ceramide Kinase (CERK),
  Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase (SMPD1–4), Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS1–2), UDP-Glucose
  ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), β–glucocerebrosidase (GBA1), β–galactosidase
  (GLB1), –1,4–Galactosyltransferase 6 (B4GALT6) are the enzymes of the pathway. (B)
  Schematic showing major subtypes of breast cancer, such as luminal A, luminal B,
  luminal B with HER2 overexpression (also called triple-positive, TPBC), triple-negative
  (TNBC)/Basal-like, and HER2+.
