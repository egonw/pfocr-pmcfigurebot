caption: (A) Pathways related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Illustration of altered
  genes involved in IPA canonical pathway “mitochondrial dysfunction”. Overlap p-values,
  a measure of the overlap between observed gene expression changes and known targets
  regulated by transcriptional regulators, were calculated using Fisher’s exact test.
  Activation z-score (z-score), an indicator of the regulatory direction of a pathway,
  was calculated based on a database of molecular networks representing experimentally
  observed gene expression or transcriptional events, where a positive z-score means
  “activation” and a negative z-score means “repression”. In the mitochondrial dysfunction-pathway
  map obtained by IPA [], upregulated components of gene expression involved in mitochondrial
  Complexes I-V are in red, and downregulated components are in green. (B) Western
  blotting analysis of ATP synthase lipid-binding protein, ATP5A (Complex V), succinate
  dehydrogenase, SDHB (Complex II), NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex
  subunit 8, NDUFB8 (Complex I), and Ponceau-S staining as a loading control. The
  quantified bands were normalized to Ponceau (total protein) (n = 6). Statistical
  analysis was performed with Student’s t-test; * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates
  p < 0.01, and n.s. indicates not significant.
