figure_title: SP1 mediates acetate-induced regulation of SAT1 in an ACSS2-dependent
  manner
caption: 'a, Transcription factor motif search for H3K27ac-bound peaks. b, Fold enrichment
  of SP1 binding on the promoter regions of SAT1 gene in HPAF-II cells upon acetate
  treatment. The fold change values are normalized to IgG control (n = 4 in each group
  from independent biological replicates). c, Relative mRNA levels of SP1 and SAT1
  genes in scrambled control (siScr) and SP1 knockdown (siSP1) CFPAC-1 cells upon
  acetate treatment for 24 hrs (n = 4 in each group from independent biological replicates).
  d, Relative mRNA levels of SP1 and SAT1 genes in siScr and siSP1 T3M4 cells upon
  acetate treatment (n = 4 in each group from independent biological replicates).
  e, Immunoblots showing the levels of SP1 and SAT1 proteins in siScr and siSP1 CFPAC-1
  and T3M4 cells, upon treatment with 5 mM acetate. Representative images of two independent
  experiments. f, g Relative mRNA (f) and protein (g) levels of SAT1 and SP1 in HPAF-II
  cells overexpressing SP1 in the absence and presence of 5 mM acetate for 24 hrs
  under acidosis (f: n = 4 in each group from independent biological replicates; g:
  Representative images of two independent experiments). h, Immunoblots showing the
  levels of ACSS2 and SP1 proteins in siScr and siACSS2 PDAC cell lines upon treatment
  with 5 mM acetate for 24 hrs in acidosis. Representative image of two independent
  experiments. i, GSEA enrichment plot of SP1 signaling pathway in S2-013 cells between
  control cells (siScr) in presence and absence of acetate, siScr vs siACSS2 cells,
  and siScr vs siACSS2 both in the presence of acetate (statistics calculated using
  Permutation analysis through GSEA). j, Relative levels of lysine-acetylated proteins
  in CFPAC-1 and T3M4 cells upon treatment with 5 mM acetate for 6 hrs under acidosis.
  Representative images of two independent experiments. k, Pathway enrichment analysis
  of differentially regulated lysine-acetylated proteins in vehicle control- and acetate-treated
  S2-013 cells (statistics calculated using the Binomial test). l,m, Plot of RMSD
  for wild type SP1 (l) and SP1 acetylated at K19 position (m) for 250 nsec of simulations.
  One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test; mean ± s.e.m. (b,c,d,f).'
