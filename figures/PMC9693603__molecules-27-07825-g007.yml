caption: Effect of azilsartan on the expression of NF-kB, TWIST, SNAIL, SLUG, bax
  and bcl2 genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Relative gene expression
  in both cancer cells treated with the IC50 concentration of azilsartan compared
  to untreated cells. Expression was normalized to the corresponding GAPDH gene expression.
  Bars represent mean Â± SD, n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed by two-way
  ANOVA, where *** p < 0.001, compared to untreated cells.
