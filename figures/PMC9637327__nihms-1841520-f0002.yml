caption: 'FAK blockade prevents psychological depression-promoted tumor metastasis
  and desmolpasia in the orthotropic 22Rv1 model. a Time course of restraint stress
  and tumor implantation. b Body weight of mice (n = 10). The statistical analysis
  was based on Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttests (shNC non-stress vs shNC stress,
  from week 4 to week 7, ***P < 0.001; shPTK2 non-stress vs shPTK2 stress, from week
  4 to week 7, ***P < 0.001). c Sucrose consumption ratio in the sucrose preference
  test (n = 10). The statistical analysis was based on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post-hoc tests (***P < 0.001). d Illustrative examples of in vivo bioluminescence
  imaging of 22Rv1 cells orthotropic implanted in the ventral prostate of nu/nu mice
  (n = 5). e ROI analysis of fluorescence intensities from the 22Rv1 cells orthotropic
  tumors (n = 10). The statistical analysis was based on One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post-hoc tests (*P < 0.05). f Representative fluorescence images of metastatic sites
  in the 22Rv1 model. g H&E and Masson staining of the prostate in the 22Rv1 model.
