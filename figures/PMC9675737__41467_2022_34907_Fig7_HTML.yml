  pathway
caption: a Spectral counts) of the identified proteins in the PFKFB2 protein complexes
  upon the indicated treatments in NRASQ61- and BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells (n = 3
  biologically independent experiments). Proteins already described to interact with
  PFKFB2 (black); new proteins described in this work (blue). b Representative immunoblot
  showing the amounts of the indicated proteins after isolation of His-tagged PFKFB2
  complexes in NRASQ61 and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells. Numbers show the fold
  induction of the indicated ratio (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). c
  Graphs showing the fold change differences with respect to the control (spectral
  peak areas) of the indicated phosphorylated/unphosphorylated ratio peptides in NRASQ61
  and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells upon the indicated treatments. Each condition
  represents three biologically independent experiments (n = 3) that were pooled before
  the mass spectrometry analysis. d Immunoblot showing the binding of PFKFB2 to BRAF
  and p-BRAFS445 in NRASQ61 mutant melanoma cells under 1 h GS; n = 3 independent
  experiments per treatment). e Representative in vitro interaction assay of GST-BRAF
  and recombinant PFKFB2 (rPFKFB2). Immunoblots show the amounts of the identified
  proteins after GST pull-down (n = 3 independent samples). GST protein was used as
  a control. f Representative in vitro kinase assay (n = 3 independent samples) using
  rPFKFB2, GST-ARAF, GST-BRAF, and GST-CRAF. Ponceau S staining shows rPFKFB2. g Immunoblot
  showing the amount of the identified proteins after isolation of the protein complexes
  as indicated in the scheme. Total lysate 5% (T.L.), 4 h GS, and pull-down (P.D.)
  (n = 2 independent biological experiments). h Representative in vitro interaction
  assay of rPFKFB2, rPFKFB3 and GST-BRAF. The immunoblots show the amount of the identified
  proteins after the PFKFB2/PFKFB3 immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down (n = 3). Isotype
  IgG and GST were used as controls. i Immunoblot showing the amount of PFKFB3 expressed
  in melanoma cell lines, including patient-derived cell lines. (n = 2 independent
  biological experiments). j Immunofluorescence showing the expression of PFKFB3 in
  human melanoma samples. Bars represent 400 µm. (n = 7 NRASQ61-mutated and n = 8
  BRAFV600E-mutated). The graph shows the H-score of the evaluated samples (mean ± SD;
  p value, unpaired two-sided t test). k Immunoblot showing the activation of ERK1/2
  upon 4 h GS and/or sorafenib treatment in PFKFB2 or PFKFB3 knockdown NRASQ61 and
  BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells (n = 2 biologically independent experiments). C
  Control, GS glucose starvation; Sor. Sorafenib; Scrbl. scrambled siRNA.
