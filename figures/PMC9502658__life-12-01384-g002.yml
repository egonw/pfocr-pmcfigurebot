caption: Proposed mechanism of action of ivermectin in COVID-19. IVM blocks the binding
  complex of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the ACE2 receptor, and additionally it blocks
  the TMPRSS2 protein, inhibiting viral entry into the host cell. IVM could also inhibit
  the TLR receptors and block NF-κβ, inhibiting the production of the cytokines TNF-α,
  IL-1 and IL-6 and ROS. TLR also activates IRF3 and IRF7, which initiate the production
  of type-I and -III IFNs. IFNs activate the JAK/STAT pathway, while IVM can lower
  the expression of JAK2 and the activity of STAT3. Moreover, in the cytosol, IVM
  blocks the 3CLpro, the main protease that participates in the viral replication,
  and blocks the importin complex α/β1 that transports the VP to the nucleus. Furthermore,
  IVM blocks the overexpression of HIF-1α, induced by the viral protein ORF3a. IVM
  has also been shown to mitigate the proinflammatory state, where the cytokine storm
  activates the participation of monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, and IVM
  also promotes the polarization of M2 macrophages over M1. IVM, ivermectin; IC, intracellular;
  EC, extracellular; VP, viral protein; TLRs, toll-like receptors; NF-κβ, nuclear
  factor-kappa beta; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL-1, interleukin-1, IL-6;
  interleukin-6; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IRF 3/7, interferon regulatory factors;
  DC, dendritic cells; M1, M1 macrophage; M2, M2 macrophage; 3CLpro, 3-chymotrypsin-like
  protease. Created with BioRender.com.
