caption: Ku80 knockdown or/and inhibition of LSD1 repress the growth of xenograft
  tumor in vivo, and CHIP-PCR detection of the abundance of ku80 bound to the FOXF2
  promoter region. A. The fifth pair of primers (the amplified region is FOXF2 The
  687-887 bp in the base sequence of the promoter region of the gene). B. The amplified
  binding region was significantly higher than the fragment amplified by other primers.
  C. After CHIP and detecting the protein in the eluate, Ku80 protein can be detected.
  D. Western bolt detects the expression level of H3K4me2 in the FOXF2 gene promoter
  region in Ku80#2 + RN-1 group; E. Comparison of Ku80#2 + RN-1 group with control
  and shKu80#2 group. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
article_title: LSD1 regulates the FOXF2-mediated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by
  interacting with Ku80 to promote colon cancer progression.
