caption: 'Correlation analyses among intratumoral microbiome, immune infiltration,
  and metabolic features by GSVA. (A) Amino acid, carbohydrate, energy, glycan, and
  lipid metabolism were upregulated in Bacteria-T compared with Virus-T. (B) Macrophage
  infiltration was positively correlated with amino acid metabolism. Escherichia coli
  mainly induced upregulation of the amino acid metabolism pathway. HBV mainly induced
  upregulation of the glycan metabolism pathway. Abbreviation: GSVA, gene set variation
  analysis.'
