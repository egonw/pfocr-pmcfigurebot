caption: LC–MS analysis of quinone extracts of C. glutamicum strains WT, UBI401, UBI405,
  UBI412, and UBI413 to identify metabolic bottlenecks in CoQ10 production. (A) Overlay
  of UV chromatograms with black arrows pointing at CoQ8-11 peaks and blue arrows
  pointing at 8P-Ph–11P-Ph peaks to indicate the low flux from nP-Ph to CoQn; (B–E)
  SIM overlays of NH4+ adduct of MK10(H2) (m/z = 872.7, B); NH4+ adduct of 10P-HB
  (m/z = 836.7, C); NH4+ adduct of 10P-Ph (m/z = 792.7, D); NH4+ adduct of CoQ10 (m/z
  = 880.7, E); (F) Metabolic pathway of CoQn and MKn(H2) biosynthesis. Enzymes are
  in bold, heterologous enzymes are underlined. As IspB mainly synthesizes NPP and
  OPP and DdsA mainly synthesizes DPP and UPP, the enzymes and corresponding direct
  products were marked with matching colors. The question mark indicates that the
  reaction attributed to Cgl0472 is not experimentally proven. MEP, methylerythritol
