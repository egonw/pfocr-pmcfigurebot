caption: 'EA treatment suppresses fibrosis via ferroptosis induced by the activated
  HSC pathway. Primary HSCs were further isolated from CCl4 mice treated with or without
  EA, and total RNA was extracted for RNA-Seq.(A) Microarray heatmap illustrating
  genes with at least a 2-fold change in transcript levels between isolated primary
  HSCs treated with EA and control cells. Bright blue, underexpression; gray, no change;
  bright red, overexpression (CCl4, n = 3; CCl4+EA, n = 3). (B) Volcano plot demonstrates
  clustering of isolated primary HSCs. Hierarchical cluster analysis of significantly
  differentially expressed mRNAs: bright blue, underexpression; gray, no change; bright
  red, overexpression (CCl4, n = 3; CCl4+EA, n = 3). (C) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) indicated a significant change in ferroptosis signaling induced by EA treatment.
  NES, normalized enrichment score. (D) The levels of total GSH, GSH/GSSG ratio, (E)
  intracellular ferrous iron, (F) MDA and (G) the fluorescence intensity of C11-BODIPY581/591
  were assayed in isolated primary HSCs from control and CCl4 mice treated with or
  without EA (n = 8–10). (H) Representative western blot and summary data of PTGS2
  and GPX4 in control and CCl4 mice. Data were normalized to GAPDH. n = 5. (I) Representative
  images of PTGS2 (green) and α-SMA (red) costained liver sections from control and
  CCl4 mice collected at 4 weeks. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). (J) The
  morphological mitochondrial changes in control and CCl4 mice treated with or without
  EA were determined by transmission electron microscopy analysis. Representative
  photographs are shown. n = 3. The black arrow indicates mitochondria. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 between
  the indicated groups. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
