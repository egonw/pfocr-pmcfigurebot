caption: 'Analysis of RNA-seq of LbMYB48-silenced L. bicolor lines. (A) Venn diagram
  of up-regulated differentially expressed genes and down-regulated differentially
  expressed genes in TRV:: LbMYB48 and TRV::0 lines; (B) Differentially expressed
  genes found in RNA-seq experiments related to the development of plant epidermal
  cells (salt glands), salt stress, ABA signaling pathway and ROS scavenging; (C)
  KEGG signal pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in LbMYB48
  silenced lines.'
