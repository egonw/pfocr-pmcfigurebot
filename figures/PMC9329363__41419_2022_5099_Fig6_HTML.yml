figure_title: ARHGEF2 was involved in the resistance of lenvatinib
caption: A After interfering with the expression of ARHGEF2 in the HepG2 cell line,
  detected the sensitivity of cells to lenvatinib by flow cytometry. B The IC50 value
  of lenvatinib was measured in ARHGEF2 knockdown and control HepG2 cells. C The IC50
  value of lenvatinib in ARHGEF2 overexpression and control MHCC97H cells. D Flow
  cytometry were used to detected the sensitivity of cells to lenvatinib in ARHGEF2
  overexpression and control MHCC97H cells. E The IC50 value of lenvatinib in TM-treated
  HepG2 cells with or without ARHGEF2 knockdown. F The proliferation ability of the
  HepG2 cells with different treatments were detected by clone formation assay. G
  Representative images of tube forming ability of HUVEC cells treated with different
  CM. H Tumors from mice after different treatments. I, J Measurement of tumor volume
  (I) and weight (J). K The expressions of Ki67, CD31, CD34 and ARHGEF2 in different
  groups were detected by IHC.
