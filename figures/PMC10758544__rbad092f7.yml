caption: Byakangelicol alleviated osteoclasts’ formation in a mouse calvarial osteolysis
  model. (A) H&E staining of cranial tissues of mice in various groups. (B and E)

  (C and F) Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis for MMP9 of decalcified
  bone sections. (D and G) Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis
