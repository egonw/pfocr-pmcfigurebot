caption: Impact of FAC treatment on myotube size and signalling pathway involved in
  muscle mass regulation and mitochondrial function. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes
  were exposed to various concentrations of FAC (10 and 50 μM) in serum‐free medium
  for 72 h. (A) Representative morphology of myotubes at 72 h after vehicle or FAC
  treatment. (B) Quantitative analysis of myotube diameter. (C) Protein expression
  or activation of key proteins involved in proteolysis, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial
  function in response to FAC 10 and 50 μM. (D) Representative blotting images used
  for the quantification shown in (B). Values are the mean ± SD. The experiments were
  performed on three independent replicates of three dependent samples for each condition.
  Significance was checked using Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparisons. Significant
  differences between conditions (**P < 0.01). 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E‐binding protein 1; Akt, protein kinase B; COXIV, cytochrome c oxidase
  IV; Cyt c, cytochrome c; HSC70, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein; Murf1, muscle
  RING‐finger protein‐1; MHC, myosin heavy chain; Nf‐κB, nuclear factor‐κB; Ub Prot,
  polyubiquitinated proteins.
