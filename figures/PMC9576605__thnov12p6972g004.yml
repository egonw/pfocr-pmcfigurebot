caption: PI4KA regulated OXPHOS via ERK/AMPK signaling. (A) The levels of PtdIns4P
  were assayed by ELISA kit (n = 3, ***p < 0.001, compared with control). (B) PtdIns4P
  polarization was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope. And the average
  fluorescence intensity of PtdIns4P was marked. Scar bar, 2 µm. (C, D) Cells transfected
  with sgPI4KA. OCR and ATP production were determined by using commercially available
  assay kits (n = 3, **p < 0.01). (E) Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed
  by the JC-1 aggregate/monomer fluorescence ratio. (F) Transmission electron microscopy
  observation of mitochondrial morphologies. Scar bar, 1 µm. (G) The expression of
  ERK/AMPK signaling pathway related proteins was detected by Western blot. (H) Cell
  viability was assessed by CCK-8 kits (n = 3, ***p < 0.001). (I) The expression of
  ERK/AMPK signaling pathway related proteins was detected by Western blot. (J) The
  levels of OCR was assessed by using commercially available assay kits (n = 3, ***p
  < 0.001). (K) Cells treated with PtdIns4P or DOX. Cell number was detected using
  Beckman Coulter Z2 Particle Counter (n = 3, ***p < 0.001).
