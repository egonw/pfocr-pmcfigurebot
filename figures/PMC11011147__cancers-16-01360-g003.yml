caption: 'CF10 activates the ATR/Chk1 pathway, consistent with replication stress,
  and causes DNA DSBs in CC531 cells. Western blots from CC531 cell lysates: (A) CF10
  doseâ€“response graphs demonstrate that a 250 nM dose is sufficient for ATR/Chk1 pathway
  activation and DNA DSBs; (B) equimolar 5-FU is not effective in ATR/Chk1 activation
  and DNA DSBs; and (C) a 10-fold greater 5-FU dose is relatively less effective than
  250 nM CF10. * indicates mono-ubiquitnated FANCD2.'
