caption: 'Nrf2 expression in phrenic motoneurons following C2 hemi-section. (A) Representative
  images showing expression of Nrf2 in phrenic motoneurons labeled with CTB in uninjured
  animals and in denervated phrenic motoneurons in C2 hemisected rats, 1 h and 7 d
  post-injury (P.I.). (B) Quantification of Nrf2 in phrenic motoneurons for uninjured
  animals, and intact and injured sides of C2 hemisected animals 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and
  7 d following injury. # Compared to 1 h P.I. group, p < 0.05. * Compared to uninjured
  group and 1 h P.I. corresponding side, p < 0.05. â€  Uninjured compared to 1 h intact
  side and injured side, p < 0.05.'
