caption: 'The effect of PLCE1 knockdown on the proliferation and clone formation of
  OS cells. (A) Detection of the expression of PLCE1 in hFOB1.19 and OS cell lines
  by qRT-PCR. (*means compared with hFOB1.19, *p<0.05) (B) Detecting the silencing
  efficiency of PLCE1 with qRT-PCR (C) In MG63 cells, CD70 decreased with the silencing
  of PLCE1. (D and E) Detecting the silencing efficiency of PLCE1 in MG63 cells with
  WB. (F-I) CCK8 analyzes the effect of silencing PLCE1 on the proliferation of MG63
  cell line. (J and K) The effect of silencing PLCE1 on cell clone formation of MG63
  cell line (* or ** means compared with blank group, # or ## means compared with
  si-NC group. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, #p<0.05, and ##p<0.01). PLCE1: Phospholipase C epsilon
  1; OS: Osteosarcoma; WB: Western blot.'
article_title: PLCE1 is a poor prognostic marker and may promote immune escape from
  osteosarcoma by the CD70-CD27 signaling pathway.
