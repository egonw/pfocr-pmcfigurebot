caption: Antidepressant ketamine pathway. Ketamine causes a burst of glutamate which
  stimulates AMPA receptors causing depolarization and activation of voltage dependent
  Ca2+ channels, leading to release of BDNF and stimulation of TrkB-Akt that activates
  mTORC1 signaling leading to increased synthesis of proteins required for synapse
  maturation and formation. In other conditions where BDNF release is blocked the
  synaptic actions of ketamine are blocked. Scopolamine also causes a glutamate burst
  via blockade of acetylcholine muscarinic M1 (ACh-M1) receptors on GABA interneurons
  [].
