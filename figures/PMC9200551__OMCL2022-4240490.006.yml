caption: 'Comparisons of the target proteins expressed in the AMPK/mTOR pathway of
  NOR vs. AST. (a) Protein levels were determined by the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay.
  (b) Box plot diagram showing the expression levels of Rictor, phospho-Rictor/Rictor,
  phospho-AMPKα (Thr172), and phospho-AMPKα/AMPKα1. GLUT1: glucose transporter 1;
  LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; PFK-1: phosphofructokinase-1; MCT4: monocarboxylate
  transporter 4; NOR: normozoospermia; AST: idiopathic asthenozoospermia.'
