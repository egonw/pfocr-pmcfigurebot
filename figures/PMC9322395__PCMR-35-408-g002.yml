caption: Vitamin D metabolism pathway. In the skin, 7‐dehydrocholesterol is converted
  into pre‐vitamin D3 by UV light and then modified into vitamin D3. The dietary or
  therapeutic sources of vitamin D are transported in the blood by means of vitamin
  D binding proteins and are hydroxylated in the liver into 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3.
  25(OH)D3 is further hydroxylated in the renal tubules into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin
  D3, the active form of the hormone. 1,25(OH)2D3 can also be synthesised in extra
  renal tissues and cells where it usually acts on local cells as a paracrine or intracrine
  factor. The amount of 1,25(OH)2D3 produced in the kidney is tightly regulated by
  serum calcium, parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D3 levels which control the homeostasis
  of extracellular fluid (ECF) levels of calcium and phosphate
