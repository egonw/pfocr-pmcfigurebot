caption: Kinase expression of SYK, RIOK2, MAP3K2, and MAP3K3 is elevated in erlotinib-resistant
  MDA-MB-468 TNBC. (A) Euler diagrams of the overlap of kinases quantified from erlotinib-resistant
  486LR cells (left panels) or cabozantinib-resistant 231LR (right panels) compared
  to the respective sensitive controls. (B) Distribution of kinases from each of the
  kinase families quantified from erlotinib-resistant (468LR) versus sensitive (468S)
  (left panels) and cabozantinib-resistant (231LR) vs. sensitive (231S) (right panels)
  proteome and kinome. (C,D) Average logarithmic (base 2) fold-change for kinases
  quantified in kinomic and proteomic experiments of (C) 468LR/468S and (D) 231LR/231S.
  Dashed lines demarcate the threshold for biological significance (1.5×, ±0.59 in
  log2 base). Statistically significant increases in kinases are indicated in red.
