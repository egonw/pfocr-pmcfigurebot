figure_title: Distinct quaternary structures selectively control G protein and β-arrestin
  recruitment
caption: a Surface representation of the CXCR4 inactive state monomeric structure
  highlighting the distinct oligomerization interfaces controlling either β-arrestin
  recruitment (extracellular side and TM core of TMH5, blue) or Gi activation and
  nanocluster formation (intracellular side of TMH6, orange). b The hotspot binding
  sites controlling CXCR4 oligomerization through TMH5 (designed residues in red)
  are poorly conserved in the chemokine receptor family, except for the β-arrestin
  signaling switch W5.34. Aromatic residues are highly enriched at position 5.34 of
  other dimerizing GPCR families. c Conserved position and conformation of W5.34 in
  human chemokine receptor X-ray structures. The superposition of W5.34 conformations
  is shown in the center. d Conservation of the β-arrestin signaling switch in the
  TM5 of vasopressin/oxytocin receptors and opioid receptors.
