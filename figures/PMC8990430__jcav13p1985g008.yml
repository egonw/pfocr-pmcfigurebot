caption: (A) Protein expression and mRNA level of ASF1b were efficiently inhibited
  by Sh-ASF1b in AGS. (B) Representative images of subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude
  mice injected with AGS cells transferred with stably Sh-ASF1b/NC. (C,D) Tumor volumes
  and final body weights of mice injected with AGS cells transferred with stably Sh-ASF1b/NC.
  (E) ASF1b, Ki-67 and VEGF staining with corresponding antibody in xenografted AGS
  tumors after ASF1b silencing or NC, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), scale
  bar = 10 Î¼m.
