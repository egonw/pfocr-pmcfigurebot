caption: 'QAE inhibits the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated
  BV2 microglial cells. After QAE pretreatment (25–100 μg/mL) for 3 h, BV2 microglial
  cells were exposed to LPS (100 ng/mL) for 1 h. (a) Phosphorylation and degradation
  of IκBα. Equal protein loading was verified by β-actin immunoblotting (n = 3). (b)
  p65 expression in nuclear. Equal nuclear protein loading was verified by TATA-box
  binding protein (TBP) immunoblot (n = 4). (c) Immunocytochemistry. After treatment,
  cells were immunostained with an anti-NF-κB (p65) antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
  secondary antibody. Scale bar represents 25 μm. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear
  counterstaining (n = 3). (d) Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536. Expression of phosphorylated
  p65 was normalized with expression of total p65 immunoblotting (n = 3). Significant
  versus control, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001; Significant versus LPS alone-treated
  group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.'
