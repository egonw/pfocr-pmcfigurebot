caption: The upregulated osteogenesis of OP‐BMSCs after overexpression of Mettl3 in
  vitro. (A, B) ALP staining showed that alkaline phosphatase activity of the Mettl3(+)
  group was higher than that of CON, Mettl3(−) and Mettl3(+) + DKK1 groups after osteogenic
  induction for 3 and 5 days. (C) Alizarin red staining showed that the bone differentiation
  potential of the Mettl3(+) group was increased compared to that of CON, Mettl3(−)
  and Mettl3(+) + DKK1 groups after osteogenic induction for 21 days. (D) Immunofluorescence
  staining for RUNX2 after osteogenic induction for 3 days. (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining for OPN after osteogenic induction for 3 days. (F) Semi‐quantitative analysis
  of ALP staining, Alizarin red staining and immunofluorescence staining by utilizing
  ImageJ. Data represent the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
