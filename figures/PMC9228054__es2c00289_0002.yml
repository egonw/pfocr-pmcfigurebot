caption: Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of petroleum diesel versus (a)
  biodiesel (BD) and (b) renewable diesel (RD) pathways. Marker symbols represent
  life-cycle GHG emissions, including land-use change (LUC) emissions. UCO refers
  to used cooking oil. The rendering bar for UCO also includes UCO collection emissions.
  The corn oil pathway is based on distillers corn oil (DCO), not edible corn oil.
