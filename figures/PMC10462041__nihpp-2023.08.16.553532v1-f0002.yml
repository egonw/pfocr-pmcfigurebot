figure_title: Endogenous production of 3-HK through the kynurenine pathway is important
  for defense against lethal S. Typhimurium infection
caption: (A) Schematic representation of the kynurenine pathway. (B) 4-amino-N'-benzyl-N-hydroxy-1,2,5-oxadiazole-3-carboximidamide,
  an Ido inhibitor, sensitizes larvae to sublethal challenge with S. Typhimurium (275+/−71
  CFU) and the sensitivity is reversed with d-Kynurenine or 3-HK (**, p=0.0049, Ido
  inhibitor; **, p=0.0013, d-Kynurenine; ****, p<0.0001). (C) Ro 61-8048, a Kmo inhibitor,
  sensitizes larvae to sublethal challenge with S. Typhimurium (329+/−62 CFU) and
  the sensitivity is significantly reversed with 3-HK (*, p=0.0289; ****, p<0.0001).
  (D) Kmo morphants are sensitized to sublethal challenge with S. Typhimurium (385+/−98
  CFU) and the sensitivity is significantly reversed with 3-HK (*, p=0.0248; ***,
  p=0.0003). (B,C,D) For each graph, N=20 larvae/ condition; statistical significance
  was determined with the log rank test; data are representative of at least 3 independent
  experiments.
