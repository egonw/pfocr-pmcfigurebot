caption: Lipidomic analysis of primitive erythroid precursors at E10.5 and E12.5 of
  gestation. (A) Peak areas for detected lipids were summed according to head groups
  and classes plotted as horizontal bar plots according to log10 (peak area sum).
  Top significant lipids from phophatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines
  (LPCs) are highlighted. (B) Relative protein levels for fatty acid (FA) synthase
  (FASN) along with an illustration of the Lands cycle are shown. (C) Relative transcript
  levels for steayl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), SCD2, and SCD3 are plotted. (D) Peak
  areas for lipids were consolidated by the cumulative degree of unsaturation in acylchains
  and plotted as bar graphs. (E) Heat map depicting z score normalized values for
  FAs and oxylipins. (F-G) Transcript levels of Tp53 (F) and STEAP3 (G) along with
  protein levels are shown. (I) Transcript levels for cholesterol pathway proteins
  (ABCA1), HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr), mevalonate kinase (Mvk), and phosphomevalonate
  kinase (Pvmk) are shown. (J) Heat map depicting z score normalized values for cholesteryl
  esters. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001, ****P < .0001.
