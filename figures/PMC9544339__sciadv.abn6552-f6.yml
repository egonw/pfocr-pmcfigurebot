figure_title: ORAI1 regulates HDM-induced airway inflammation through IL-2R expression
  and IL-2 signaling
caption: (A) GSEA plot of DEGs that belong to the gene set IL-2/STAT5 pathway (M234)
  () in OT-II CD4+ T cells from WT and Orai1fl/flCd4Cre at day 14 after HDM/OVA treatment
  (B). (B) Normalized Il2ra mRNA expression in CD4+ OT-II T cells from mice after
  IAVOVA infection or HDM/OVA treatment from RNA-seq (). (C to F) IL-2 treatment restores
  HDM-induced airway inflammation in Orai1-deficient mice. (C) Experimental protocol.
  WT and Orai1fl/flCd4Cre mice were immunized and challenged with HDM; some Orai1-deficient
  mice received recombinant human IL-2 (1.5 × 105 IU/day, i.p.) during HDM challenge
  from days 9 to 13. (D) Representative H&E stains of lungs. Scale bars, 1000 μm (left)
  and 50 μm (right). (E) Peribronchial inflammation scores. (F) Representative flow
  cytometry plots and MFI of GATA3 expression in CD4+ T cells isolated from the lungs
  normalized to levels in WT mice. Data in (B) are the means ± SEM of three mice per
  cohort. Data in (E) and (F) are the means ± SEM of five mice per cohort from two
  independent experiments. Statistical analysis in (B) and (F) is performed by unpaired
  Student’s t test; that in (E) is performed by Mann-Whitney test. ***P < 0.001; **P
  < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
