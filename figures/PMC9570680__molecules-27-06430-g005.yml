caption: Structure and in vivo activity of an MCoTI-based cyclotide designed to antagonize
  an intracellular PPI []. (A) The structure of the bioactive cyclotide MCo-PMI (magenta)
  and its intracellular molecular target, the p53 binding domain of oncogene Hdm2
  (blue), was determined in solution by NMR. Cyclotide MCo-PMI binds with low nM affinity
  to the p53-binding domains of Hdm2 and HdmX. (B) Cyclotide MCo-PMI activates the
  p53 tumor suppressor pathway and blocks tumor growth in a human colorectal carcinoma
  xenograft mouse model. HCT116 p53+/+ mouse xenograft models were treated with vehicle
  (5% dextrose in water), nutlin 3 (10 mg/kg) or cyclotide (40 mg/kg, 7.6 mmol/kg)
  by intravenous injection daily for up to 38 days. Tumor volume was monitored by
  caliper measurement. (C) Tumor samples were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed
  by western blotting for p53, Hdm2, and p21, indicating activation of p53 on tumor
  tissue in vivo. Figure adapted from reference [].
