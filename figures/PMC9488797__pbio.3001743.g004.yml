figure_title: Metabolic profile comparison of GF, OligoMM12, and SPF C57B6/J mice
  by UPLC/MS
caption: '(A and B) Principal coordinate analysis using Canberra distances of metabolites
  identified by untargeted UPLC/MS in liver and plasma during the (A) light phase
  (Zeitgeber 5) and (B) dark phase (Zeitgeber 16). (C-F) Metabolic pathways identified
  in the KEGG PATHWAY database; red dots represent pathways containing compounds differentially
  enriched in OligoMM12 vs.GF and OligoMM12 vs. SPF comparisons and selected compounds
  obtained by targeted peak extraction from differentially expressed pathways. Samples
  obtained during the light phase (Zeitgeber 5) and dark phase (Zeitgeber 16) in (C
  and D) liver and (E and F) plasma. p-values obtained by Tukeyâ€™s honest significance
  test after log2 transformation of area value. Number of mice per group: Liver ZT5:
  GF = 4, OligoMM12 = 6, SPF = 7; ZT16: GF = 4, OligoMM12 = 6, SPF = 7 / Plasma ZT5:
  GF = 4, OligoMM12 = 7, SPF = 7; ZT16: GF = 5, OligoMM12 = 6, SPF = 6. Data underlying
  this figure are supplied in . GF, germ-free; SPF, specific-opportunistic-pathogen-free;
  UPLC/MS, ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry;
  ZT, Zeitgeber time.'
