caption: '(A) Schematic representing the workflow of metabolic pathway activity analysis
  for each macrophage cluster with scRNA-seq.(B) Landscape of the activity of different
  metabolic pathways in different macrophage populations (left). Enrichment analysis
  by GSEA; color of each heatmap cell represents the value calculated with formula:
  +/−Log2|NES/FDR|. Red: significantly up-regulated (nominal p < 0.05); blue: significantly
  down-regulated (nominal p< 0.05); gray: pathways not enriched (nominal p > 0.05).
  Heatmap on the right shows the ratio between tumor and normal sample and the polarization
  state as well as the origin, defined in , for each macrophage population; AA: amino
  acid metabolism; NES: normalized enrichment scores, FDR: false discovery rate.(C)
  The activity of selected metabolic pathway in selected macrophage populations. Normalized
  enrichment scores and nominal p values are calculated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.(D)
  Workflow of metabolic heterogeneity analysis of macrophages with scRNA-seq; GO:
  the gene ontology; Lipid: lipid metabolism; Purine: purine metabolism; Gly: glycolysis;
  AA: amino acid metabolism; OX: oxidative phosphorylation.(E) UMAP plots showing
  the metabolic clusters of macrophages. The color of each dot indicates the dominant
  metabolic cluster of each cell, determined using 1,310 metabolic genes.(F) GSEA
  score (+/−Log2|NES/FDR|) of 5 metabolic clusters against 5 metabolic gene signatures.
  Red: positively enriched; green: negatively enriched; white: not enriched.(G–I)
  UMAP plots showing the metabolic clusters of macrophages. The color of each dot
  indicates the developmental origin (G) and the sample (H) as well as the polarization
  state of each macrophage (I).(J) The expression level of genes from SLC family members,
  ABC transporters, and pump and ion channels. Fold change: each metabolic cluster
  compared with other clusters.(K) Enrichment analysis of transcriptional factors
  (TF) associated with the 5 metabolic clusters using BART (binding analysis for regulation
  of transcription) (), with top 10 highly expressed genes in each cluster; top 5
  significantly enriched TF in each cluster represented; red grid: top 5 or not; white
  grid: not available.(L) The metabolic landscape of macrophage populations from normal
  and tumor in the context of 14 original macrophage populations, as shown in , the
  dot color was coded based on the dominant metabolism, as shown in .(M) Relative
  proportion of cells in each metabolic cluster, as shown in , versus samples from
  normal and tumor. Chi-squared test was used to calculate the significance between
  tumor and normal groups; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.(N) Immunofluorescence
  staining of CLEC4F and F4/80 in liver tissue with tumor.(O) Sankey diagram showing
  the distribution of macrophages in terms of origin and metabolic clusters.'
