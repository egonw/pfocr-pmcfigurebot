caption: TNF-α promoted the expression of RARγ by activating NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (a,b) The 24 hours supernatant of synovial fibroblasts from healthy human and OA
  patients was cocultured with normal chondrocyte C28/I2 for 24 hours, respectively.
  Then, the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and the expression of RARγ in C28/I2
  cells were detected by western blot (a) and qRT-PCR (b). (c) The expression of TNF-α
  in synovial fibroblasts of healthy persons and OA patients was detected by qRT-PCR.
  (d) After C28/I2 cells were treated with TNF-α (30 ng/mL) or IKK inhibitor BMS-345541
  (10 μm) at different time points, the expression of RARγ and NF-κB signaling pathway
  were examined by western blot. (e,f) After the C28/I2 cells were treated with TNF-α
  (30 ng/mL) and BMS-345541 (10 μm) separately or in combination, changes in NF-κB
  signaling pathway and the expression of RARγ in C28/I2 cells were detected by western
  blot and qRT-PCR. (g) HEK-293 cells were transfected with RARγ promoter reporter
  plasmid and pRL-TK reporter internal reference plasmid; the fluorescence intensity
  of renilla (RL) and firefly (FL) was detected after 4 hours of treatment with TNF-α
  (30 ng/mL) and BMS-345541 (10 μm), respectively, or in combination, and the values
  were normalized. Data were mean ± SEM of three independent assays (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p
  < 0.01; and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
