figure_title: The transmission pathway of EEE
caption: The transmission pathway of EEE consists mainly of a cycle between the enzootic
  vectors, mainly Culiseta melanura, and amplifying hosts, which include many species
  of birds. Occasionally, transmission through a bridge vector will cause disease
  in dead-end hosts like humans and horses [].
