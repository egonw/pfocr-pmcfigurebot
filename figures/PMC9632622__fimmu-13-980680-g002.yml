caption: 'Regulation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 4F pathway. Gene expression
  is regulated during transcription and mRNA translation. The translation of the mRNA
  is mainly controlled in the initiation phase by the eukaryotic initiation factor
  4F complex. This complex is composed of three subunits: i.) eIF4G, serving as the
  backbone and stabilizing other regulatory factors; ii.) eIF4A, a helicase involved
  in mRNA unwinding to facilitate recognition and translation by ribosomes; and iii.)
  eIF4E, recognizing and binding the 5´cap-mRNA. Consequently, the activity of this
  complex is modulated via phosphorylation by two major signaling cascades: the PI3K/mTOR
  and the MAPK/ERK pathways. On the one hand, the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway regulates
  eIF4F via phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Initially, 4E-BPs
  binds to eIF4E suppressing translation initiation by disrupting the eIF4F complex.
  However, phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by the PI3K/mTOR promotes the release of 4E-BPs
  and allows translation initiation. On the other hand, activation of MAPK/ERK signaling
  leads to the phosphorylation of MNK1/2, a kinase that phosphorylates eIF4E. This
  results in translation initiation. The activation of signaling cascades is mediated
  by receptors activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, including cytokines, hormones,
  and growth factors.'
