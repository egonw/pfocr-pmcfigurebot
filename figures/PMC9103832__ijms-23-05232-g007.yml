caption: PRDX2 knockdown activates IL6-induced JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in chondrocytes.
  (A) IL-6 expression levels were decreased after treatment with PRDX2 siRNA in the
  hypertrophic chondrocytes for 72 h by qRT-PCR. (B,C) The p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein
  levels were increased after treatment with PRDX2 siRNA for 72 h by Western blot.
  (D) PRDX2 knockdown inhibits extracellular matrix synthesis of chondrocytes by inhibiting
  Wnt5a/YAP1/CTGF and activating IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathways in deer antler. The data
  include the means Â± SD of three independent experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
