caption: 'Results of animal experiments after the 12-week intervention. (A) Se concentrations
  of rat serums in different groups. *** p < 0.001. (B) Se concentrations of rat livers
  in different groups. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. (C) Representative HE and Masson
  staining results in the liver’s portal and central venous regions. Scale bar: 200
  μm. (D) TEM observations of ultrastructural changes in livers. Compared with the
  normal group, the malformed mitochondria (□) and typical mitophagy phenomenon (→)
  were observed in the low-Se group. There was mild swelling of mitochondria (□) and
  typical mitophagy phenomenon (→), but the number was significantly reduced compared
  with the low-Se group. Se: selenium.'
