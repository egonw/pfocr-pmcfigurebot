  and volcano plot (B) between the model and SZ-A groups. (C) Venn diagram of the
  number of differential metabolites among groups. (D) Differentially expressed lipid
  classes. (E) Heatmap visualization of the intensities of metabolic biomarkers between
  the model and SZ-A groups. (F) Bar plot of differentially expressed lipids between
  the model and SZ-A groups. (G) Pathway analysis of differential metabolites.
