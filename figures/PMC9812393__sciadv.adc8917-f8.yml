figure_title: The SKN-1A/Nrf1 lipid homeostasis response
caption: Model and summary diagram (inset) of the findings shown here. OA activates
  SKN-1A through a previously unknown mechanism that we term the SKN-1A/Nrf1 lipid
  homeostasis response. In this pathway, OA is sensed through LD formation and effects
  on ER membrane homeostasis. These changes enhance ERAD efficiency, thereby increasing
  levels of SKN-1A, which, in turn, remodels lipid metabolism gene expression and
  reduces fat storage in LDs. OA acts through this pathway to extend C. elegans life
  span.
