caption: Perturbations of the cell membrane do not induce the proHJ transcription
  in B. subtilis 168. Exponentially growing cultures in SMM were exposed to the sub‐MIC
  (15 µg ml−1) of mono‐ and di‐rhamnolipid congeners. The cells were treated with
  or without kanamycin and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. (A) shows the differences in
  optical densities of tested cultures, whereas (B) represents the corresponding relative
  fluorescent GFP signal. The black curve shows the OD600 and RFU for cells treated
  only with rhamnolipids. All measurements were performed in biological duplicates,
  and the mean values were plotted on the graphs. The relative fluorescent signal
  was estimated by dividing the GFP signal by the cell density. The value is represented
  in arbitrary units.
