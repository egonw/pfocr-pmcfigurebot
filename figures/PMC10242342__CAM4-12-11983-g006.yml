caption: ITGA5 is correlated with angiogenesis in cervical cancer. (A) TCGA database
  volcano plot demonstrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cervical
  cancer patients with different ITGA5 expression (TCGA code CESC). (B) GSEA indicate
  that angiogenesis is significantly enriched in highly expressed ITGA5 associated
  DEGs. (C) The correlations between ITGA5 and angiogenesis pathway. Spearman correlation
  test. (D) Representative cases with high (NO.1) and low levels (NO.50) of ITGA5
  that are correspondingly stained CD31 to identify microvessels are shown. Scale
  bar, 50 μm. (E) Correlation analysis of the immunohistochemistry score of ITGA5
  and the microvessel density (MVD) in cervical cancer tissues (N = 57). Pearson correlation
  test. (F) Representative images of tube formation assays and 3D spheroid sprouting
  assays of HUVECs treated with conditional medium from HeLa cells transfected with
  siITGA5 or negative control siRNA (NC). The representative sprout is marked by green
  line. The histograms show the number of nodes and junctions of the tube formation
  assay and the average sprout length of 3D spheroid sprouting assay of three independent
  experiments. Scale bar, 50 μm. Bar, SD; One‐way ANOVA. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
