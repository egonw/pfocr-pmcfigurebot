caption: ZNF692 positively regulates MEK/ERK signaling to promote cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion. (A) Volcano plot illustrating the ZNF692-associated genes
  based on Pearson correlation analysis. (B) KEGG analysis revealed that ZNF692-associated
  genes were mainly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway. (C-D) Western blot analysis
  of MEK1/2, P-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2 in osteosarcoma cells stably knocking
  down ZNF692, and quantitative analysis. (E-F) Western blot analysis of MEK1/2, P-MEK1/2,
  ERK1/2, and P-ERK1/2 in osteosarcoma cells stably overexpressing ZNF692, and quantitative
  analysis. (G) Application of U0126 (an inhibitor of MEK/ERK signaling) partially
  counteracted the enhanced cell proliferation generated by overexpression of ZNF692.
  (H) Application of U0126 partially counteracted the enhanced cell migration generated
  by overexpression of ZNF692. (I-J) Application of U0126 partially counteracted the
  enhanced cell invasion generated by overexpression of ZNF692. Student’s t-test and
  one-way ANOVA were performed to analyze differences between groups. All data are
  presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
