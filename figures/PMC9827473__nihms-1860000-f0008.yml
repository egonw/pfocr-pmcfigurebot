figure_title: Model of low-K+ kidney injury
caption: In WT animals, low K+ causes increased basolateral K+ efflux through Kir4.2,
  reducing intracellular K+ (K+i) and pHi. This increases glutamine uptake along the
  basolateral membrane and its catabolism through GLS, producing ammonia, which is
  secreted into the lumen via NHE3. Glutamate dehudrogenase (GLUD) catalyzes conversion
  to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Metabolic flux through this pathway is increased under
  low-K+ conditions, causing increased kidney hypertrophy, inflammation, injury, and
  fibrosis. Kir4.2 deletion prevents alterations in basolateral K+ flux under low-K+
  conditions. Kir4.2−/− mice do not develop intracellular acidosis or increased glutamine
  catabolism and are protected from kidney hypertrophy and injury. While GLS knockout
  mice do develop an intracellular acidosis under low-K+ conditions, the absence of
  GLS prevents increased glutamine catabolism, affording renoprotection. Error bars
  indicate SEM.
