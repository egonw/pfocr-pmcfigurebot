caption: Metabolic pathway significance analysis of E. coli W3110 under gallic acid
  stress versus fermentation without stress. A Up-regulated metabolic pathways, gene
  rate (a) showed the ratio of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in related pathways
  to total up-regulated DEGs; B down-regulated metabolic pathways, gene rate (b) showed
  the ratio of DEGs in related pathways to total down-regulated DEGs
article_title: Toxicity and inhibition mechanism of gallic acid on physiology and
  fermentation performance of Escherichia coli.
