caption: The roles of IFNs in therapy. Targeted therapy, radiotherapy and Oncolytic
  virotherapy stimulate the immune system of OC mainly through the IFN-I pathway,
  which promotes the recruitment and activation of pro-immune cells. Cell therapy
  can autonomously secrete IFN-γ to exert anti-cancer effects, and immune checkpoint
  inhibitor therapy requires indirect induction of IFN-γ production through feedback
  from immune checkpoints. The produced IFN-γ helps the formation of immune-friendly
  microenvironment, and high IFN-γ is associated with good prognosis. This picture
  is drawn with the help of Figdraw.
