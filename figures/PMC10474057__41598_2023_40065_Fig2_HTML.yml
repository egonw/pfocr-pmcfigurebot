caption: Selection of top features based on three independent analyses. (a) We used
  three independent statistical tests to select a single top features set for metabolic
  pathway enrichment analyses. Additionally, we used a weighted co-abundance network
  approach (analogous to WGCNA used for gene expression data) to form manipulation-correlated
  feature modules (resulting in 16 feature sets) for enrichment analyses. Results
  from those enrichment analyses were subsequently subjected to multiple filters to
  arrive at a final set of pathways and feature sets of interest. We also performed
  an enrichment analysis on a set of features only present in manipulated samples,
  but we found no overrepresented pathways and this feature set is not depicted in
  the figure. (b) Volcano plots per dataset show DAMs that increased (red) or decreased
  (blue) at manipulation according to a 1.5-fold change and p ≤ 0.05 t-test threshold.
  (c) PCAs for each dataset show distinct clustering of samples between manipulated
  (orange) and healthy ants (gray) along PC1. (d) Features that passed at least two
  selection criteria (bold) were classified as top features and used for further pathway
  analyses. Top features were enriched for eight KEGG metabolic pathways.
