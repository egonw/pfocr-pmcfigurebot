figure_title: Proteomic analysis of EDL, soleus and EOM muscles from WT mice confirms
  the significant difference in content if proteins involved in the TCA cycle and
  electron transport chain, fatty acid metabolism and muscle contraction
caption: '(A) Hierarchically clustered heatmaps of the relative abundance of proteins
  in EDL (columns 1–5) and soleus muscles (columns 6–10) from five mice. Blue blocks
  represent proteins which are increased in content, yellow blocks proteins which
  are decreased in content in EDL versus soleus muscles. Right pie chart shows overall
  number of increased (blue) and decreased (yellow) proteins. Areas are relative to
  their numbers. (B) Volcano plot of a total of 1866 quantified proteins which showed
  significant increased (blue) and decreased (yellow) content. The horizontal coordinate
  is the difference multiple (logarithmic transformation at the base of 2), and the
  vertical coordinate is the significant difference p value (logarithmic transformation
  at the base of 10). The proteins showing major change in content are abbreviated.
  Soleus: condition 2; EDL: condition 1(C) Reactome pathway analysis showing major
  pathways which differ between EDL and soleus muscles. (D) Hierarchically clustered
  heatmaps of the relative abundance of proteins in EDL (columns 1–5) and EOM muscles
  (columns 6–10) from five mice. Blue blocks represent proteins which are increased
  in content, yellow blocks proteins which are decreased in content in EDL versus
  EOM muscles. Right pie chart shows overall number of increased (blue) and decreased
  (yellow) proteins. Areas are relative to their numbers. (E) Volcano plot of a total
  of 1866 quantified proteins which showed significant increased (blue) and decreased
  (yellow) content. The horizontal coordinate is the difference multiple (logarithmic
  transformation at the base of 2), and the vertical coordinate is the significant
  difference p value (logarithmic transformation at the base of 10). The proteins
  showing major change in content are abbreviated. EOM: condition 2; EDL: condition
  1 (F) Reactome pathway analysis showing major pathways which differ between EDL
  and EOM muscles. (G) Hierarchically clustered heatmaps of the relative abundance
  of proteins in soleus muscles (columns 1–5) and EOM (columns 6–10) from five mice.
  Blue blocks represent proteins which are increased in content, yellow blocks proteins
  which are decreased in content in soleus muscles versus EOM. Right pie chart shows
  overall number of increased (blue) and decreased (yellow) proteins. Areas are relative
  to their numbers. (H) Volcano plot of a total of 1866 quantified proteins which
  showed significant increased (blue) and decreased (yellow) content. The horizontal
  coordinate is the difference multiple (logarithmic transformation at the base of
  2), and the vertical coordinate is the significant difference p value (logarithmic
  transformation at the base of 10). The proteins showing major change in content
  are abbreviated. EOM: condition 2; soleus: condition 1 (I) Reactome pathway analysis
  showing major pathways which differ between soleus and EOM muscles. A q-value of
  equal or less than 0.05 was used to filter significant changes prior to the pathway
  analyses. An additional filter was applied to the Heatmaps and Piecharts and only
  proteins showing a significant change ≥0.2 fold are included.'
