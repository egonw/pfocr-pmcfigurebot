caption: DMA does not affect levels of MAPK signaling pathway proteins in SIM-A9 cells.
  Immunoblots of MAPK signaling pathway proteins in SIM-A9 cells after stimulation
  with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 15 min in the absence or presence or various concentrations
  of DMA. GAPDH was used as a gel loading control. To conserve reagents, membranes
  were cropped after proteins were transferred and portions of the membrane containing
  the proteins of interest were used for western blotting.
