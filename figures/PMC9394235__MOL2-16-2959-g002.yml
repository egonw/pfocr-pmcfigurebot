caption: Signaling pathway activation upon fMLF or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)
  supernatant (SN) treatment of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. (A) Activation of
  downstream signaling pathways in HCT116 cells induced by fMLF (10−9  m) or Lactobacillus
  rhamnosus GG (LGG) supernatant (SN) (1 : 30 titration) or the relative controls
  [not‐treated (NT) or broth alone, respectively]. Total cell lysates were prepared
  at various time points after stimulation in serum‐free medium. Immunoblots were
  probed with the indicated phosphospecific Abs. Antitubulin was used for normalization.
  The figure shows the results of a representative experiment from among three different
  preparations. (B) ALOX15A, ALOX15B and ChemR23 mRNA fold change in HCT116 cells
  treated with fMLF (10−9  m) or LGG SN (1 : 30 titration) for 3 h following or not
  cell preincubation with U0 126 (10 μm) for 30 min. Data are represented as mean ± SD
  of five independent experiments. *P < 0.05 compared with the negative control (dotted
  line) by Student's t test; §P < 0.05 compared with the relative control treatment
  by Student's t test. (C) VEGF‐B and VEGF‐C mRNA fold change in HCT116 cells treated
  with fMLF (10−9  m) or LGG SN (1 : 30 titration) for 3 h following or not cell preincubation
  with U0 126 (10 μm) for 30 min. Data are represented as mean ± SD of five independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05 compared with the negative control (dotted line) by Student's
  t test; §P < 0.05 compared with the relative control treatment by Student's t test.
