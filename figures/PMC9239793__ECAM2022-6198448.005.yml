caption: CRC differential gene GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. (a) Differential upregulated
  gene KEGG pathway enrichment results. (b) Differential downregulated gene KEGG pathway
  enrichment results. (c). Differential upregulated gene GO term enrichment results.
  (d) Differential downregulated gene GO term enrichment results. The different colors
  represent the significance of differential enrichment results. The larger value
  represents the smaller fdr value. The circle size represents the number of enriched
  genes, and the more the number, the larger the circle.
