caption: JMJD3 regulates Th17-cell differentiation induced by Pg-LPS through STAT3.
  Purified CD4+ T cells were treated with the JMJD3 inhibitor GSK-J4 (80 nM), Pg-LPS
  (1 μg/mL), or GSK-J4 and Pg-LPS and cultured under the same conditions as the Th17
  differentiation system. The cultures were further incubated for 5 days for RNA analysis,
  FACS analysis, western blotting, and ELISAs. (a) The frequency of Th17 cells was
  significantly decreased after JMJD3 blockade in both the control and LPS groups.
  (b) The mRNA expression of Jmjd3, Stat3, Rorc, and Il-17a in the control, GSK-J4,
  LPS, and LPS+ GSK-J4 groups. (c) GSK-J4 significantly reduced the concentration
  of supernatant IL-17A in both the control and LPS groups. (d, e) The protein levels
  of JMJD3, STAT3, RORγt, and IL-17A in the control, GSK-J4, LPS, and LPS+ GSK-J4
  groups. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of four independent experiments. Significant
  changes are marked with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
