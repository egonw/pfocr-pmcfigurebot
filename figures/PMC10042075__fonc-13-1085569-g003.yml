  treatment. (B) Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes in LASCPC-01
  after fluoxetine treatment. (C) Heatmap showing the transcriptome analysis of AKT
  downstream genes in LASCPC-01 after fluoxetine treatment. (D) Western blot showing
  the levels of the PI3K-AKT related pathway after fluoxetine treatment in LASCPC-01
  in a dose-dependent manner.
