caption: A 6-Deoxy-l-iminosugar inhibits E. coli WbbL-dependent O-Ag synthesis. (A)
  Schematic of O16 O-Ag model pathway, which requires WbbL. (B) In vitro inhibition
  assays indicate iminosugar 2 inhibits WbbL, while l-Man does not (IC50 with 95%
  confidence interval). (C) Addition of 2 to E. coli expressing wbbL reduces O-Ag
  synthesis as demonstrated by silver staining (top) and anti-O16 blotting (bottom)
  of purified LPS; Lipid A standard was utilized (Figure S26). Paired t test used;
  error bars represent SD (n = 3).
