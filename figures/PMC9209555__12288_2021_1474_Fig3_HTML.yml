caption: Schematic diagrams of the JAK-STAT pathway, HIF-1 pathway, and PI3K-AKT pathway.
  The HIF-1 signaling pathway is activated, and EPO secretion increases under hypoxic
  conditions. EPO then binds to the EPO receptor (EPOR). The JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  can also be activated and plays an anti-apoptotic role. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  could promote the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL and affect cell proliferation
  and differentiation. TCL1A activates the AKT pathway, which plays a role in cell
  survival by affecting the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kB (NFkB)
