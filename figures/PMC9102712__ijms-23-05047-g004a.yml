caption: Effects of HPH-15 on a Smad-dependent pathway in TGF-β signaling. (A) The
  activity of a reporter product transcribed from a Smad binding promoter in A549
  cells. The cells co-transfected with pGL4.48[luc2P/SBE/Hygro] Vector (with SBE and
  firefly luciferase gene) and pRL-Luc (with a β-actin promoter and renilla luciferase
  gene for internal control) were incubated for 16 h. After the cells were incubated
  for another 8 h in the presence of HPH-15 (10 μM) and TGF-β (10 ng/mL), the cells
  were lysed. The lysate was analyzed by a dual luciferase assay, and the values obtained
  were normalized. Relative values are shown. (B) Protein levels of phosphorylated
  Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β-stimulated A549 cells treated with HPH-15. After incubating
  the cells for 1 d in the presence of HPH-15 (10 μM) and TGF-β (10 ng/mL), the cells
  were lysed. The lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting. (C) Quantification of phosphorylation
  of Smad2 and Smad3. The intensity of the bands in (B) was quantified using ImageJ.
  Relative values (band intensity of phosphorylated protein and that of unphosphorylated
  protein) are shown as values of “Relative phosphorylation of protein.” (D) Time
  course of the amounts of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in TGF-β-stimulated
  A549 cells treated with HPH-15. After incubating the cells for the designated time
  in the presence of HPH-15 (10 μM) or SB525334 (10 μM) and TGF-β (10 ng/mL), the
  cells were lysed. The lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting. (E) mRNA levels of
  TGF-β1 (TGF-β) in TGF-β-stimulated A549 cells treated with HPH-15. After incubating
  the cells for 4 or 24 h in the presence of HPH-15 (10 μM) and TGF-β (10 ng/mL),
  RNA was extracted from the cells, and RT-PCR was performed. Relative values are
  shown. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with samples treated with TGF-β and without
  HPH-15.
