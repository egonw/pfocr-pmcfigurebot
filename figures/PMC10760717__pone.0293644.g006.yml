figure_title: Biological pathways potentially governed by tissue-shared and tissue-specific
  mitomiR targetomes
caption: The whole targetomes (predicted and validated) of tissue-shared or tissue-specific
  mitomiRs were analyzed by the program DAVID. Significantly enriched pathways according
  to KEGG are showed for tissue-shared (A; top-20 p values), liver-specific (B), testis-specific
  (top-20 p values) and WAT-specific mitomiRs; “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway” was the
  only one significantly enriched for gastrocnemius-specific mitomiRs targetome; full
  lists are given as Supplementary material. Biological pathways were considered statistically
  significant if p value was less than 0.05 (Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for multiple
  correction).
