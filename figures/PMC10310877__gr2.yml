caption: 'Aging alters NF-ĸB DNA binding and Nrf2 DNA binding activities in the hippocampus
  of WT and GPx-1 KO mice; effects of MCG. Changes in NF-ĸB DNA binding activity (A)
  and Nrf2 DNA binding activity (B) over time. Effects of MCG against aging-induced
  changes in NF-ĸB DNA binding activity (C) and in Nrf2 DNA binding activity (D).
  M = months old. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M. of 8 animals. ∗P < 0.05
  vs. corresponding 3 M. #P < 0.01 vs. corresponding WT. +P<0.05 vs. 6 M. †P < 0.05,
  ††P < 0.01 vs. Saline / WT. §P < 0.01 vs. Saline / GPx-1 KO. Two-way ANOVA followed
  by Fisher''s LSD pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the data.'
