figure_title: Transcriptomic alteration of the descending aorta by BAPN administration
caption: (A) Principal component (PC) analysis. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses
  for up- and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Heatmap for DEGs
  annotated as (C) “focal adhesion” and (D) “cell cycle” in the KEGG database. Box
  plots for (E) LOX and LOXL family, (F) major RAS components, and (G) TGFβ ligands
  and receptors. CPM indicates count per million. Descending thoracic aortas were
  harvested from 20 mice per group and every 4 aortas were pooled together. Therefore,
  RNA sequencing was performed using in n=5 biological replicates per group.
