caption: 'Identification of plasma, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
  derived EVs from included COPD patients. A Morphology of extracellular vesicles
  by electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. B Exosome nanoparticle
  tracking analysis. The mean size of EVs in sputum is 124.4 nm; EVs in BALF is 142.1 nm;
  EVs in serum is 124.1 nm. C Identification of characteristic marker including TSG101
  and CD63 by western blot. D Level of IL-6, IL-8, Elane, Antitrypsin and MUC1 in
  extracellular vesicles derived from sputum, BALF and plasma of COPD patients examined
  by western blot. E Heatmap indicating the results of mRNA expression of significant
  difference genes between two groups (HBE treated CSE and subsequent EVs isolated
  from patients with or without HUA). F-G KEGG enrichment (F) and GO enrichment (G)
  analysis of these significant differentially expressed genes. Abbreviation: BALF,
  bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; TSG101, tumor susceptibility gene101; CD63, lysosomal
  membrane-associated glycoprotein 3; MUC1, mucin 1; EVs, extracellular vesicles;
  COPD, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease'

  airway inflammation of COPD via senescence-associated pathway.
