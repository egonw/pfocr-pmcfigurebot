caption: 'Wounding healing assay of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with human platelet
  lysate (hPL) treatment at 0, 24 and 48 h (A). Cell migration is represented as the
  ratio of the scratched wound area of HDFs with 24 and 48 h PL treatment to the area
  without treatment (0 h). Cell viability of D‐gal induced HDFs at 24 and 48 h after
  hPL treatment (B). SA‐β‐gal staining of HDFs with hPL treatment and scoring the
  SA‐β‐gal positive cells number (C). Scale bar = 200 μm. Data expressed as mean ± SD.
  ##p < 0.01 vs. NC group; *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. model group by one‐way ANOVA
  followed by least significant difference multiple comparison. We repeated the experiments
  three times to ensure the accuracy of the experiments'
