figure_title: BRCA2 expression in the cancer cells affects the transcriptional profile
  of PSCs and CAFs
caption: (a) A heatmap representing the 20 most upregulated genes in KPC-shBrca2-CM-treated
  PSCs compared to shControl, (see Methods and Supplementary Data , tab 7), and the
  20 most upregulated genes in KPC-shControl-CM-treated PSCs (compared to shBrca2).
  Clu is marked by an arrow. n = 2 biologically independent domes for DMEM treated
  PSCs and n = 3 biologically independent domes for shControl-CM-treated and KPC-shBrca2-CM-treated
  PSCs. (b) Schematic representation of the workflow. 2×104 KPC-shBrca2 or KPC-shControl
  cells were inoculated into the pancreata of syngeneic C57BL/6 J mice. Three weeks
  later the mice were sacrificed, tumors were dissected and CAFs were isolated by
  FACS sorting (see Methods). The scheme was generated with biorender.com. (c, d)RNA-seq
  analysis of CAFs from KPC tumors. n = 3 mice for KPC-shControl tumors and n = 4
  mice for KPC-shBrca2 tumors (c) Heatmap representing hierarchical clustering of
  the DE genes between CAFs from KPC-shBrca2 or KPC-shControl tumors (right), and
  pathways enriched in each cluster with their corresponding p-values (left). Pathway
  analysis was performed using Metascape, selected pathways are shown, see Supplementary
  Data  for the full list. (d) A heatmap representing the 20 most upregulated genes
  in KPC-shBrca2-tumor CAFs, and the 20 most upregulated genes in KPC-shControl-tumor
  CAFs. (e, f) DE genes between KPC-shBrca2-CM treated- and KPC-shControl-CM treated-PSCs
  (e) and CAFs (f) were matched to a database of murine HSF1 targets genes. The statistical
  significance of the dependency between treatment (shBrca2/ shControl) and HSF1 targets
  was tested using a Chi-square test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
