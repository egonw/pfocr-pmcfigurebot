caption: Cellular uptake and use of ascorbate. Ascorbate (Asc) is taken up by human
  cells with the help of the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters SVCT1 and SVCT2.
  Dehydroascorbate (DHA) can be transported by different glucose (GLUT) transporters
  depending on cell type. Within cells ascorbate can serve as antioxidant, as enzyme
  substrate in reactions generating peptides and hormones such as dopamine. As cosubstrate
  in 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2ODDs) reactions it takes part in ECM regulation
  via e.g., collagen synthesis as well as gene regulation by modulating HIF prolyl
  hydroxylases and histone demethylases. DHA catabolism can, via the pentose phosphate
  pathway, contribute to nucleotide synthesis by generating xylulose 5-phosphate.
