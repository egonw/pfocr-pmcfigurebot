caption: The proposed pathway by which IRE1α regulates the oxidative stress response
  via miR‐25‐3p/Nox4 in neuron and glia cells after ICH. ① ICH induces ER stress and
  activates the phosphokinase activity of IRE1α. ② Self‐phosphorylated IRE1ɑ increases
  the expression of miR‐25‐3p. ③ The complementary combination of miR‐25‐3p with Nox4
  mRNA inhibits the translation of Nox4 mRNA and subsequently downregulated expression
  of Nox4, which leads to ROS production decrease, especially H2O2.
