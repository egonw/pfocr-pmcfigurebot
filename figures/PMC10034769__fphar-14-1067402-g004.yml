caption: 'Role of UA in Ferroptosis during LPS-mediated injury in vitro and in vivo.
  (A,C) Levels of SLC7A11 and GPX4 in BEAS-2B cells were measured. (B,D) Quantification
  of SLC7A11 and GPX4 levels in lung tissues. (E,F) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of GPX4 in BEAS-2B cells. (G–I) IHC images for GPX4 and 4-HNE expression
  in lung tissues. (J) Fe2+ expression in BEAS-2B cells. (K) TEM imaged showed ferroptosis
  of lung tissues. The results were represented by mean ± SD. ## p < 0.01, ** p <
  0.01, &&p < 0.01 in comparison with control, LPS and LPS + UA groups, separately.'
article_title: Urolithin A (UA) attenuates ferroptosis in LPS-induced acute lung injury
