caption: 'On-demand responsive nanoplatform mediated targeting of CAFs and down-regulating
  mtROS-PYK2 signaling for antitumor metastasis. (A) Disintegration of the on-demand
  successively responsive HPBC@TRP/NPs and its therapeutic mechanism. (B) TEM images
  of HPBC@TRP/NPs. (C) Zeta potential reversal characteristic. (D) Evaluation of the
  relative cell viability and mechanism of the apoptosis signal pathway. (E) CLSM
  images of α-SMA activated CAFs in 4T1/NIH3T3 cells treated with PFD and HPBC@TRP/NPs.
  Down-regulation of the mitochondrial oxidation system and cancer associated fibroblasts
  in vitro: Western blot protein expression levels of PYK2 (F), α-SMA (G), and TGF-β
  (G) in 4T1/NIH3T3 co-cultured cells. (H) Enhanced in vivo therapeutic effect. (I)
  Normalization of the tumor ECM to remodel TME. (J) Modulation of TIME in 4T1/NIH3T3
  tumors after treatments. Reprinted from Zuo T, Zhang J, Yang J, et al. On-demand
