caption: Functional analysis and identification of mutation landscape. GO enrichment
  between the high-risk and low-risk groups (a). Online Proteomaps pathway analysis
  of the identified 43 irlncRNAs (b). The third hierarchy level reveals those lncRNAs
  involved in NQO1 pathways, MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and Jak-STAT
  signaling pathway. The lowest level shows the individual proteins.
