caption: 'Exosomal miR-34c-5p took part in the EA effect through the proliferation
  of ICC and the expression of SCF. (a) Immunohistochemical staining of ICC (brown).
  The nuclei were visualized using hematoxylin (bluish-violet). Magnification: ×200.
  (b) Immunohistochemical staining of SCF (brown). The nuclei were visualized using
  hematoxylin (bluish-violet). Magnification: ×200. (c) The rate of the SCF-positive
  area. (d) The number of ICC in colonic tissues. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the control
  group; ##P < 0.01 compared with the STC group; &&P < 0.01 compared with the EA group.'
