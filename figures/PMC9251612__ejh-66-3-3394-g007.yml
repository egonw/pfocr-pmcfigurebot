caption: NRSN2 activated the ERK1/2-Bcl-xL signaling pathway to promote OS cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion. After 24 h of EV treatment, NRSN2 overexpression treatment
  and 20 μM ERK1/2 specific inhibitor PD98059, WB showed that the levels of the ratio
  of p-ERK1/2:ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL protein were decreased (A); EdU assay demonstrated
  that proliferation rate was decreased (B); flow cytometry showed that apoptosis
  was increased (C); Transwell assay showed that cell migration (above) and invasion
  (below) were decreased (D). Three cell tests were performed and the data were expressed
  as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison among groups (A) and independent
  t-test was used for comparison between two groups (B-D). Tukey's multiple comparisons
  test was used for post-hoc test; **p<0.01, *p<0.05.
