caption: (A) SEMA3B is down-regulated in lung cancers. ****P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs
  signed-rank test. LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma. RSEM, RNA-seq by expectation-maximization.
  (B) Deletion of LATS1/2 in NCI-H1299 cells block SEMA3B-induced YAP/TAZ phosphorylation.
  The left panel shows the KO efficiency of LATS1 and LATS2, while the right panel
  shows YAP phosphorylation by SEMA3B. (C) Suppression of anchorage-independent colony
  formation in NCI-H1299 cells by SEMA3B requires LATS1/2. A representative image
  was shown for triplicates in each group. Notably, LATS1/2 dKO formed larger colonies,
  and SEMA3B still reduced colony size in LATS1/2 dKO cells, suggesting that SEMA3B
  may attenuate colony growth by additional mechanisms. (D) Quantification of (C).
  ***P < 0.001, two-tailed t test, n = 3; n = 3. (E) Inhibition of NCI-H1299 xenograft
  volume by SEMA3B requires LATS1/2. ****P < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA) test, n = 8. The results shown here are representative of two independent
  animal trials. (F) Measurement of tumor weights. **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test,
  n = 8. (G) Deletion of LATS1/2 in HUVECs blocks YAP phosphorylation induced by SEMA3A-conditioned
  medium. (H) Recombinant SEMA3A proteins inhibit tube formation of WT but not LATS1/2
  dKO HUVECs. (I) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of an in vivo plug assay using WT
  and LATS1/2 dKO HUVECs inoculated into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
  mice. SEMA3A gene expression was introduced to the cells by lentiviral transduction.
  Mature blood vessels with blood are shown in the representative images. Scale bars,
  50 μm. (J) CD31 staining of endothelial cells in the plugs. Scale bars, 20 μm. (K)
  Quantification and statistical analysis of (J). **P < 0.01, S3A versus Ctrl, Student’s
  t test was performed. (L) Conditioned medium from SEMA3B-restored NCI-H1299 cells,
  but not from the control cells, inhibits transwell migration of HUVECs in a LATS1/2-dependent
  manner.
