figure_title: Combination of LPS and HG increased apoptosis and pyroptosis rates in
  mRECs
caption: After treatment with 5.5 mM, 30 mM and 50 mM D glucose for different durations
  (24 h, 48 hand 5 days), cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. a Cell
  apoptosis in the presence of 5.5 mM D- glucose, b Cell apoptosis in the presence
  of 30 mM D- glucose, c Cell apoptosis in the presence of 50 mM D- glucose, Data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs.
  the control group.
