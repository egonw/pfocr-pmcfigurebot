figure_title: TNF-induced necroptosis of uninfected ATII cells in Patient 1
caption: (A) Graphic. TNF, downstream necroptosis pathway components and NINJ1 are
  initially expressed in latticework bodies. Activation of the pathway generates a
  porous latticework comprised of darker staining pathway component ring membranes
  surrounding cores that stain with decreasing intensity as pathway and cell contents
  are progressively emptied. In the process, the cells enlarge and are eventually
  disrupted, releasing the pores and porous latticework into alveolar space. Because
  ATII cells proliferate in the reparative response to lung injury, alveoli are lined
  and filled by contiguous ATII cells. Activation of the necroptotic pathway fuses
  adjacent cells to amplify and shape the cytopathology, giving rise to multinucleated
  giant cells, syncytia and residual cell membranes lining and detached from alveolar
  walls.TNF. (B-F) Brown-stained TNF+ cells and structures. Hematoxylin counterstain.
  (B) TNF+ cell with densely stained latticework. Exiting cell contents visible as
  blurred lighter staining at the cell’s perimeter. (C) Fused syncytial mass of TNF+
  cells lining alveolar wall (traced). Arrow points to a trinucleate cell with “owl’s
  eye” appearance created by residual clumped chromatin in a largely emptied nucleus.
  Asynchronous emptying results in variable clearing with the most extensive clearing
  in the nucleus at the top of the cell. (D) Arrow points to lightly stained porous
  latticework emptied from the disrupted cell at the top. (E) Trinucleate cell fused
  to a cell from which emptying of contents leaves residual cell membranes traced
  by the arrowheads. (F) Rectangle encloses residual TNF+ cell membranes lining or
  detached from alveolar walls.RIPK3. (G-J) Red-stained RIPK3+ cells and structures.
  Hematoxylin counterstain. (G1–3) Progressive emptying of RIPK3+ latticework RSBs
  reveals partially and largely empty pores. (H) Fused RIPK3+ cells with visible porous
  latticework lining and detaching from alveolar wall. Red arrowhead points to pores
  with visible staining of the RIPK3+ cores; white outlined arrowhead points to largely
  emptied cores. (I) RIPK3+ porous latticework and empty pores from disrupted cells
  in adjacent alveolar space. (J) Largely emptied pores and lightly staining RIPK3+
  cell remnants lining and detached from the alveolar wall.MLKL-p. (K, L) Red-stained
  MLKL-p+ cells and structures. Hematoxylin counterstain. (K) Rectangle encloses an
  alveolus lined by fused MLKL-p+ cells. Arrow points to porous latticework emptied
  from disrupted cells. (L) Porous latticework in fused cells lining and lying within
  alveolar space. Lines connect to magnifier views of partially and largely emptied
  pores.NINJ1. (M-P) Brown-stained cells and structures. Hematoxylin counterstain.
  (M1) Darkly stained NINJ1+ latticework RSBs and blurred staining of exiting contents
  at the perimeter. (M2) NINJ1+ porous latticework in a cell in which an intact nuclear
  membrane and clumped chromatin impart an “owl’s eye” like appearance to the nucleus.
  (M3) Arrowheads point to porous latticework shared by fused contiguous cells. (N)
  Fused cells lining and lying within alveoli. Arrowheads trace the emptying of the
  latticework leaving residual cell membranes lining the alveolar wall. (O) Enlarged
  fused cells with porous latticework and residual membranes from emptied cells (arrowheads).
  (P) Rectangle encloses alveolar space with NINJ1+ porous latticework from disrupted
  cells. Arrowheads trace residual cell membranes. Circle encloses cells at an early
  stage of emptying (blurred staining).
