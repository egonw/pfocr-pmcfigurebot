caption: Blockade of DNA-PK/AKT/Notch1 signaling inhibits the proliferation and stemness
  phenotype of HCC cells. (A-B) Spheroid formation assay demonstrating the size and
  number formed by Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells treated with 5μM AZD-7648 and
  5μM MK-2206 respectively for 7 days. (C-D) Spheroid formation assay demonstrating
  the size and number formed by Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells transfected with
  Notch1-specific siRNAs for 7 days. (E-F) CCK-8 assay showing the cell growth of
  Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells treated with 5μM AZD-7648 and 5μM MK-2206 (E) and
  transfected with Notch1-specific siRNA (F). (G-J) Transwell assay showing the indicated
  number of Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25 cells treated with 5μM AZD-7648 and 5μM MK-2206
  (G-H) for 24 hours and 72 hours after the transfection with Notch1-specific siRNAs
  (I-J). (K-N) Invasion assay showing the indicated number of Huh7-SPC25 and Hep3B-SPC25
  cells treated with 5 µM AZD-7648 and 5 µM MK-2206 (K-L) for 24 hours and 72 hours
  after the transfection with Notch1-specific siRNAs (M-N) migrating from the upper
  Matrigel invasion chamber to the bottom well. Error bars represent the mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns means non-significant.
