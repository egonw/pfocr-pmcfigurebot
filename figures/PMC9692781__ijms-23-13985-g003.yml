caption: 'Characterization of unidirectional TE-NSPs. (a) Representative confocal
  reconstruction at 14 DIV of a standard midbrain population containing dopaminergic
  neurons labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH,
  red), the dopamine transporter protein (dopamine transporter, green), and all neurons/axons
  (β-tubulin III, purple). Dopaminergic neurons exhibit expression of the dopamine
  transporter (DAT), a protein involved in dopamine recycling. (b) Representative
  confocal reconstruction at 14 DIV of an enriched TE-NSP labeled via immunocytochemistry
  to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, green), RIM proteins (RIM1, red), and
  bassoon proteins (Bassoon, purple). The RIM and bassoon proteins colocalize on putative
  dopaminergic varicosities. (c–e) FSCV was used to measure dopamine release from
  TENSPs: A stimulating electrode was positioned to span the dopaminergic aggregate
  while a carbon-fiber recording electrode was placed within the aggregate. Representative
  color plots displaying the current recorded as the potential of the carbon fiber
  electrode were linearly scanned from −0.4 to 1.2 V and back to −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl
  every 100 ms (bottom). Cross-sections from the color plots display individual cyclic
  voltammograms exhibiting an oxidation peak at 0.65 V and a reduction trough at −0.3
  V, which are characteristic of dopamine (inset). Representative time vs. concentration
  plots of evoked dopamine release (top). (c) Evoked dopamine release was recorded
  from unidirectional enriched dopaminergic neurons in TE-NSPs. (d,e) Evoked dopamine
  release was also recorded from unidirectional enriched TE-NSPs following perfusion
  with different concentrations of the DAT inhibitor GBR12909. The concentration of
  GBR12909 in (d) was 0.02 μM and in (e) was 20 μM. The application of the DAT inhibitor
  GBR12909 increased both the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine and the duration
  of dopamine release. (f) Confocal reconstructions of FACS enriched aggregates at
  35 DIV labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote all dopaminergic neurons/axons
  (TH, green), glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT, red), and GABAergic neurons (Parvalbumin
  + GAD65 + GAD67, purple), with nuclear counterstain (Hoechst, blue). Following maturation
  over weeks in vitro, sorted aggregates demonstrated the presence of dopaminergic,
  GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Scale bar (a) = 20 µm. Scale bar (b) = 25
  µm. Scale Bar (f) = 20 µm.'
