caption: LncRNA HOTAIR is highly expressed in breast CSCs.A, MCF-7 ALDH1+ and MDA-MB-453
  ALDH1+ cells sorted by FACS were cultured in medium and then examined under microscope.
  Cells were magnified by 100 folds and the scale bar represented 10 μm. B, CD44 and
  CD24 were detected by Western blotting in the indicated cells. β-actin was used
  as an internal control. C, the growth rate of the ALDH+ or ALDH- cells was measured
  by MTT. Results were shown as means ± SD. D, the Caspase 3/7 activity was measured
  with or without paclitaxel (1 μM) treatments in the indicated cells. Results were
  shown as means ± SD. E, ALDH+ or ALDH- breast cancer cells were transplanted into
  the subcutaneous area of the left or right limb of the nude mouse and the tumors
  were examined 1 month after the injection. The number of mice employed in this experiment
  was ten and the scale bar represented 1 cm. F, breast CSCs (ALDH+) and non-CSCs
  (ALDH-) sorted from the corresponding cell lines by FACS were subjected to the analysis
  of HOTAIR by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression was normalized to endogenous
  β-actin. Results are shown as means ± SD. G, HOTAIR was analyzed in oncosphere and
  non-oncosphere cells derived from three breast cell lines. Results are shown as
  means ± SD. H, breast CSCs were fractionated followed by quantitative real-time
  PCR for the detection of the corresponding transcripts. β-actin and GAPDH were served
  as positive controls for cytoplasmic gene expression. U6 RNA was served as a positive
  control for nuclear gene expression. Data are representative of at least three independent
  experiments. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 by two-tailed Student’s t test. CSC, cancer stem
  cell; HOTAIR, Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA.
