caption: 'ICS II alleviated MI-induced myocardial damage in mice: (a) cardiac function
  was measured using Doppler echocardiography; (b) EF (%) (n = 6); (c) FS (%) (n =
  6); (d) HE staining was performed to observe the pathological changes in the left
  ventricle. Magnification ×400; scale bar, 50 μm; (e) mitochondrial morphology was
  observed via TEM. Magnification ×30,000; scale bar, 1 μm; (f) myocardial infarct
  size was performed via TTC staining; (g) quantitative data of myocardial infarct
  size (%) (n = 5); (h) LDH activity (n = 6); (i) Tn level (n = 6); (j) TnT level
  (n = 6). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ## p < 0.01 vs. sham; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. MI.'
