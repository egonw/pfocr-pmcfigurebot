caption: Common pathways of colorectal cancer pathogenesis [,,,,]. There are four
  parallel pathways involved in CRC progression. The chromosomal instability pathway
  (CIN) accounts for 60–85% of CRC. Mutations, such as APC loss, activation of K-ras
  or other oncogenes, and then Tp53 inactivation, drive clonal cell growth and ultimately
  the formation of invasive cancer. The serrated adenoma pathway is responsible for
  15–40% of CRC. The occurrence of a BRAF mutation and methylation of cell cycle controlling
  leads to uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells. Subsequent methylation of other
  genes, such as tp53 and p16, promotes the evolution of CRC. Microsatellite instability
  pathway (MSI) failure leads to 3–5% of CRCs and is driven by simultaneous loss of
  APC and DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR) failure. The following BRAF, Bax, or TGFβR
  mutation pushes the tumors from adenoma to CRC. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer
  accounts for about 1–2% of all CRCs. Its mechanism is similar to that in the pathogenesis
  of sporadic cancer, including p53, DNA methylation, MSI, BRAF, and K-ras mutations.
  However, they differ in timing and frequency of specific alterations. These mutations
  lead to low-grade dysplasia, which, after mutations of APC, Rb, and other TSG, progress
  to high-grade dysplasia and subsequently to cancer. CRC—colorectal carcinoma; LOH—loss
  of heterozygosity; TSG—tumor suppressor genes.
