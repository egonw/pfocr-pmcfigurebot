caption: Silencing of miR-98-5p activates the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway by
  binding to BMP2. (A) Expression of miR-98-5p after transfection with a miR-98-5p
  mimic. (B) Predicted binding site between miR-98-5p and BMP2. (C) Dual luciferase
  reporter assay was used for the confirmation of the binding relationship between
  miR-98-5p and BMP2. (D) mRNA and (E) protein expression of BMP2 after using siRNA
  to knock down its expression. (F) Cell viability was determined after HG-induced
  osteoblasts were co-transfected with the miR-98-5p inhibitor and siRNA-BMP2. (G)
  Protein expression levels of components of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway
  after HG-induced osteoblasts were co-transfected with the miR-98-5p inhibitor and
  siRNA-BMP2. (H) Expression levels of BMP2, Runx2, OCN, OPN and collagen I after
  HG-induced osteoblasts were co-transfected with the miR-98-5p inhibitor and siRNA-BMP2.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. MC3T3-E1 (Dif), MC3T3-E1

  protein 2; Runx2, Runt-related transcription factor 2; OCN, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin;
  miR, microRNA; NC, negative control; MUT, mutant; WT, wild-type; HG, high glucose;
