figure_title: Summary diagrams for HH signaling activity and HHIP expression in Control
  and after HH pathway inhibition, and models for proposed mechanism of action
caption: '(A-C) HH signaling components in fungiform (FP) and filiform (FILIF) papilla.
  (A) Control: In Typical FP/TB, SHH ligand (green) is present with the TB basal cells.
  Gli1+ HH-responding cells (blue) are in FP basal epithelial and perigemmal cells.
  HHIP (red) is within FILIF only. Hedgehog pathway inhibition: (B) In Type II Atypical
  FP/TB there is reduction of SHH+ cells from TB, loss of Gli1+ cells in one side
  of the FP wall and associated ectopic HHIP expression at the FP apex on the same
  side as loss of Gli1+ cells. (C) When Gli1+ cells are completely eliminated from
  the FP walls along with loss of SHH in Type III Atypical FP/No TB, ectopic HHIP
  expression occurs in the FP apex in a location previously occupied by the TB. The
  FP has acquired a conical FILIF-like morphology. (D) In a proposed mechanism of
  action: In FP, SHH directly and/or indirectly via activating Gli1+ cells inhibits
  HHIP expression in the papilla. In FILIF, HHIP blocks expression of SHH and downstream
  Gli1 activity. (E) We propose that the SHH ligand is secreted along FP basal epithelial
  cells signaling to Gli1+ cells of the FP wall. Concurrently, HHIP from a FILIF cell
  subset is secreted along basal epithelial cells and inhibits HH signaling. At the
  rete peg region of the FP/FILIF epithelia, signaling via Gli1+ cells is inhibited.'
