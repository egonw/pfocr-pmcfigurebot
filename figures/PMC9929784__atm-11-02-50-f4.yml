caption: The main discrepant pathways. (A) The main discrepant pathways identified
  between the ACS and HC groups. The colors of the circle represent the metabolites
  in the data with different levels of significance, with green being the least and
  red being the most significant. The size of the circle represents the pathway impact
  values from the pathway topology analysis; the range of the circle size impact values
  is 0.00 to 0.22. (B) The main discrepant pathways identified between the ACS-HTN
  and ACS groups. The color of the circle represents the metabolites in the data with
  different levels of significance, with green being the least and red being the most
  significant. The size of the circle represents the pathway impact values from the
  pathway topology analysis; the range of the circle size impact values is 0.00 to
  0.34. ABC, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle;
  GAB, Î³-aminobutyric acid; HC, healthy control; ACS, acute coronary syndrome; HTN,
  hypertension.
