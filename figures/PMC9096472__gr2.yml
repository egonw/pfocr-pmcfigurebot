caption: 'Increased resistance of A2780-R cells against oncolytic vaccinia virus(A)
  The schematic diagram of the TK-GFP + OVV, which is a TK gene-inactivated OVV expressing
  GFP instead of TK gene. (B) Green fluorescence (upper) and bright-field (lower)
  images of A2780 and A2780-R cells after infection with OVV (MOI = 0.01) at indicated
  time points. Scale bar, 200 μm. (C and D) Flow cytometric analysis of OVV-mediated
  GFP expression and oncolytic cell death in A2780 and A2780-R cells. The relative
  percentage was indicated as GFP-positive cells (OVV-infected cells) (C) and dead
  cells (D). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. ∗p <.05; #p < 0.01; ‡p < 0.001.'
