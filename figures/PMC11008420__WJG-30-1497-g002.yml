caption: MicroRNAs targeting the pathways of Wnt/β-catenin, IL6/Stat3, and TGF-β in
  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  (ESCC), miRNAs serve as crucial effector to Wnt/β-catenin, IL-6/STAT3 and TGF-β
  signalings, which is consistently involved in cancer metastasis[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,-,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,,].
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling includs Wnts, receptors (such as Frizzled, FZD and low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related proteins, LRP), Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl), β-catenin, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), Axin, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), IL-6 is known
  to activate the downstream JAK/STAT3 signaling, and canonical TGF-β pathway is mediated
  by SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4. ZEB1/2, Snail1/2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, C-myc, Vimentin
  and MMPs are specific target and key factors for ESCC metastasis. “Green” and “Red”
  indicated oncomiRs and tumor-suppressive miRNAs, respectively. The dashed arrow
  and solid arrow indicated direct targeting effect and indirect targeting effect,
  respectively.
