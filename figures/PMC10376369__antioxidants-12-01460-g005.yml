caption: Modulation of PKC-mediated pathways by EGCG in Alzheimer’s disease. EGCG
  can induce the activation of PKC pathways (1), specifically the isoform PKCζ (2)
  that enhances long-term memory (3), PKCα (4) that results in an increase in memory
  function (5) and PKCε (6) that activates BDNF factor (7), promoting synaptogenesis
  (8), neuronal survival (9), Ca2+ liberation (10) and changes of synaptic structures
  (11), altogether promoting neuroprotection (12). The generation of Aβ produces Aβ
  plaques (13), promoting neurodegeneration processes (14). Aβ also inhibits the PKC
  pathway (15) and RACK (16), whose receptors are required to activate PKC (17), and
  blocks BDNF (18). Moreover, the isoforms PKCα and PKCε activate α-secretase (19),
  promoting the generation of sAPPα (20) that inhibits Aβ production (21). PKCε activates
  ECE1 (22), which degrades Aβ (21). The activation of the PKC pathway inhibits GSK3β
  (23), which is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (24) that finally leads to neurodegeneration
  processes (14). EGCG produces the reduction in protein Bax (25) and promotes the
  degradation of protein Bad (26) through the proteasomal system (27).
