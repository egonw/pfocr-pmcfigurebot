figure_title: The TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF activates the Akt signaling pathway in SCA684Q/84Q
  mice
caption: '(A) Top: Schematic of 7,8-DHF administration followed by tissue collection
  for Western blots and RPPA. Bottom: TrkB and downstream signaling pathways. (B)
  Total TrkB levels are significantly increased in the cerebellar vermis of SCA684Q/84Q
  mice after chronic 7,8-DHF administration, while levels of phosphorylated TrkB are
  slightly increased by 7,8-DHF (C). (D) Schematic of putative Akt signaling downstream
  of TrkB activation. (E) Total Akt levels are unchanged in vermis tissue after 7,8-DHF
  administration in SCA684Q/84Q mice, but phosphorylated Akt levels are increased
  (F and G), indicating Akt activation. (H) Schematic of putative ERK signaling downstream
  of TrkB activation. (I to K) 7,8-DHF administration does not lead to activation
  of the ERK signaling pathway in SCA684Q/84Q mice. (L) Representative images showing
  pAkt(T308) in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar vermis. Scale bar, 50 Î¼m. (M)
  Quantification of pAkt(T308) staining showing that levels are increased in the Purkinje
  cells and molecular layer of SCA684Q/84Q mice that received 7,8-DHF treatment. All
  statistical tests and P values are reported in table S2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.005, P > 0.05 when not shown.'
