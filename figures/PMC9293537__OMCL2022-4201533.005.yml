caption: Antiaging effects of metformin on different cellular pathways. The antiaging
  effects of metformin occur through several mechanisms. Metformin inhibits electron
  transport chain and mitochondrial complex 1 and can exert antiaging effects in the
  AMPK-dependent or AMPK-independent pathway. In the AMPK-independent path, it reduces
  ROS and AGEs. In the AMPK-dependent pathway, it activates PGC-1α and ULK1 and can
  also inhibit mTORC1. Metformin is also involved in antiaging effects by inhibiting
  the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway. Other antiaging mechanisms of metformin include
  activating Nrf2 and inhibiting NF-κB, increasing noninflammatory cytokines, and
  decreasing inflammatory cytokines.
