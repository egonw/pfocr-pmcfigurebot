caption: Under ER stress, the UPR pathway is activated to minimize the accumulation
  of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER. ATF4, activating transcription factor
  4; ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophin factor;
  CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; EDEM1, ER Degradation-Enhancing Alpha-Mannosidase-Like
  Protein 1; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; GRP78, 78-kDa glucose-regulated
  protein; GRP94, 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein; IRE1, inositol requiring enzyme
  1; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; OASIS, old astrocyte specifically induced substance;
  PERK, protein kinase R-like ER kinase; dashed line—indirectly involved in the UPR
  pathway.
