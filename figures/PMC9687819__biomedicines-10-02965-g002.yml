caption: 'Activation of the IFN pathway. Within types I and III, there are multiple
  IFNs; within type II, there is a single IFN. Each type has a different heterodimeric
  cell surface receptor: type I IFNs bind to the IFNAR receptor complex (composed
  of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2); type III IFNs bind to the IFNLR receptor complex (composed
  of IFNLR1 and IL-10Rβ). Binding of IFN to its receptor complex results in cross-phosphorylation
  of JAK1 and TYK2 in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor subunits. This triggers
  the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. After phosphorylation, STATs form various
  complexes that translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to IFN-stimulated response
  elements (ISREs) or gamma-activated sequences (GAS) on ISG promoters. Binding to
  these promoter elements results in the transcription of hundreds of genes involved
  in the antiviral response, including OAS1, -2, -3, RSAD2, CGAS, IFITMs (-1, -2,
  -3, -5) and IFI6, among others, which will control the infectious process. Figure
