caption: RNA sequencing analysis of the kidney cortex in coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19)–associated collapsing glomerulopathy. Differentially expressed genes
  with 1.5-fold–magnitude changes between expression profiles of 1 patient with COVID-19–associated
  collapsing glomerulopathy and data from 12 control healthy individuals downloaded
  from GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) database were used for Gene Ontology (GO)
  term enrichment (GO) terms and pathway analysis by Fisher exact test with P <0.05.
  Upregulated genes were enriched for cell cycle, chromosome segregation, response
  to wounding, blood coagulation, and humoral immune response, whereas downregulated
  genes were enriched for ion transport, metabolic processes, and oxidation. Pathway
  analysis from both up- and downregulated genes showed enrichment of transmembrane
  transport, oxidation, and blood coagulation consistent with the GO terms analysis.
  Upregulated genes were enriched only for FOXM1 pathway, while genes related to renin-angiotensin
  system were downregulated.
