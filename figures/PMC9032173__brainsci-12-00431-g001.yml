caption: Graphical Abstract. Integration of the hedonic and homeostatic components
  of food intake regulation. Food stimuli are perceived during a pre-ingestive (dashed
  lines, purple or blue) phase by the sense of sight, smell, audition, and touch.
  After food ingestion, sensorial information from food’s taste, smell, consistency,
  and temperature constitutes a second stimulus inside the oral cavity (post-ingestive
  stimuli (solid lines, purple or blue)). This information travels to the central
  nervous system (CNS) through a “fast” and conscious pathway. At this point, the
  energetic and macronutrient content of food has not been sensed. However, once the
  food arrives at the gut lumen, it stimulates the release of gut hormones, such as
  peptide Y Y (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin,
  and others, based on the macronutrient composition of the food ingested. This peripheral
  metabolic feedback travels to the CNS as a signal of energy intake. Additionally,
  the mechanic distention of the gut is sensed by vagal afferents and projected to
  the brainstem to inform about the sensation of fullness. The unconscious metabolic
  and visceral feedback (bottom blue lines and boxes) and the conscious reward feedback
  (left dashed and solid purple lines) are integrated within brain areas associated
  with aversion, cognition, reward, motivation, memory, and decision making (middle
  blue and purple boxes). From these areas, information projects to higher cognitive
  brain centers to ultimately regulate eating behavior (top red lines and boxes).

  tract.
