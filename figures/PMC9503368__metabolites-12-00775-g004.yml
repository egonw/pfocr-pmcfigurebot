caption: 'The annotation results from COG, KEGG and CARD databases showed that the
  metabolic capacity of DKD microbiome changed. (A): The heat map shows the COG annotation
  results with significance; (B): COG pathway enrichment analysis bubble diagram was
  obtained using the ClusterProfile package in R; (C): The heat map displays the level
  3 sequence annotation results from the KEGG database; (D): In CAZy annotation results,
  transcripts per million (TPM) values of cohesin and dockerin are shown at the class
  level; (E): CAZy annotation results at the family level show TPM values in the heat
  map (scaled by rows). * p < 0.05.'
