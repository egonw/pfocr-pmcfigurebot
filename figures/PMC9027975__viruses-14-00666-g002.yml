caption: TRL9 pathway activation in response to DNA. TLR9 recognizes ssDNA enriched
  with CpG and 5′-xCx DNA motifs and changes the conformation of the TLR9 dimers.
  Dimers come into closer proximity and bind to the Myd88 adaptor. The adaptor recruits
  IRAK kinases and forms (i) myddosomes composed of MyD88, IRAK4, IRAK1, and IRAK2
  that promote the sequential recruitment of TRAF6, TAK1, and MAPKs, leading to the
  activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB for the production
  of inflammatory cytokines or alternatively (ii) myddosomes composed of MyD88, IRAK4,
  and IRAK1 promote the sequential recruitment of TRAF6 and TRAF3, leading to the
  activation of IRF7 and the production of IFN. Created with BioRender.com.
