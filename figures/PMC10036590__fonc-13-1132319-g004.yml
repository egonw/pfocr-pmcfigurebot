caption: Activation of the HER2/HER3 signalling pathway and its effect after activation.
  The PI3K-AKT and MAPK signalling pathways are the two main signal transduction pathways
  downstream of HER2/3 heterodimerisation activation and are involved in cell growth,
  cell proliferation, the cell cycle, protein synthesis and so on. In addition, the
  HER2/HER3 signalling pathway regulates barrier function by regulating the expression
  of CLDN18, but the mechanism is unclear.
