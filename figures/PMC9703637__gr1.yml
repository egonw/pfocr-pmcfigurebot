caption: Schematic representation of Glycolysis pathway and the regulatory enzymes.
  (A) 10 steps of glycolytic pathway. Brown and green arrows represent the preparatory
  phase and payoff phase respectively. Yellow curved arrows represent the energy consumption
  and production nodes. The enzymes involved in each node are written in red and the
  regulatory enzymes are highlighted with green background. The energy production
  during quiescence and proliferation from cytoplasm (glycolysis) and mitochondria
  (blue ovals with TCA cycle) are represented with yellow stars. Circles emerging
  from different nodes of the pathway represent the precursor molecules which end
  up in different pathways. (B.1) The inhibition of PFK leads to accumulation of F6P
  which goes into homeostasis with G6P. The excessive accumulation of G6P leads to
  inhibition of hexokinase. (B.2) The isozyme of hexokinase, glucokinase with low
  affinity to glucose is represented with a thin arrow. Both the enzymes phosphorylate
  glucose to G6P. The effect of PFK inhibition on respective enzyme is indicated in
  purple. The regulation of the enzymes in beta cells and liver is represented by
  the regulatory molecule and its effect is represented by an arrow. (C) Two PFK enzymes
  in the glycolytic pathway are represented and the effect of the regulatory molecules
  is indicated in purple. The different rates of activity of both the enzymes is represented
  by the thicknesses of the arrows. (D) Final regulatory steps of the pathway with
  two isoforms of the pyruvate kinase are represented. The phosphorylation of L isoform
  leads to deactivation of the enzyme and the effect of the regulatory molecules is
  represented in purple.
