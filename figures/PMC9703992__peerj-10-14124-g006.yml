number: Figure 6
figure_title: Cub pathway
caption: The figure shows the proposed mechanistic links between signaling pathways
  GPCR, MAPK, RTK (EGFR) and the role of ADAM17 (TACE) dependent RHBDF2 (iRhom2) during
  tumorigenesis. The enriched genes (PRKACA, RRAS, GNA12, NF- Îº B1, RELA, RELB) in
  the leading-edge analysis are highlighted in blue bubbles and shown at the site
  involved during downstream signaling.
