caption: ACE2 is highly expressed in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. A Integrative
  Genomics Viewer (IGV) results showed that drug-resistant cells have substantially
  more reads mapped onto ACE2 exons compared with the parental cells. B Facet boxplot
  showing upregulation of ACE2 expression in drug-resistant breast cancer cells (P < 0.05,
  LogFC > 1). C Western blot analysis of high expression of ACE2 protein in 468/EPR,
  468/PTR, SK-BR-3/EPR and BT-474/Lapa cells. D Volcano plot showing differentially
  expressed genes in 468/MTX and SK-BR-3/EPR cells, with labels indicating ACE2 overexpressed
  in these cells (P < 0.05, LogFC > 1).
