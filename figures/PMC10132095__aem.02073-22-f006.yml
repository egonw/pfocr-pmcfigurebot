caption: Normalized gene counts of selected genes involved in N2 fixation, electron
  transfer activity, and hydrogenase activity in MECs with 5 and 10 mM NH4+ compared
  to 0 mM NH4+. All MECs were operated at an EAN of +0.15 V versus SHE. Genes shown
  in bold are classified as differentially expressed (|log2FC| > 2.00 and P < 0.05;
  red shows upregulated genes; blue shows downregulated genes). Gene counts are expressed
  in RPKM.
