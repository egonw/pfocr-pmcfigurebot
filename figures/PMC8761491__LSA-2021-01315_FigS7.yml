caption: '(A) Primary (left and middle) and secondary (right) NF-κB response genes
  of RNAseq profile. (B) Wild-type BMDMs were stimulated with IL4/IL13, IL4/IL13 +
  TNF or IL4/IL13 + TNF + MG132. TNF and MG132 was added 12 h after IL4/IL13 stimulation.
  The last time point was 18 h of IL4/IL13 stimulation. RNA was isolated and analyzed
  for Retnla expression. Data shown are the mean fold-increase of the Ctrl group.
  (C) Overview of the ERK/JNK/p38 pathway. (D) JunB gene analysis of transcriptomics
  data set from profile GSE169348. Graph shows IL4/IL13 or IL4/IL13 + TNF stimulated
  BMDMs after 6 h. (E) Wild-type and TnfR1−/− BMDMs were stimulated with IL4/IL13,
  IL4/IL13 + IL1β, or left untreated and whole-cell lysates were isolated and analyzed
  by Western blotting for the indicated proteins. All samples were blotted on one
  gel and sliced for the indicated groups. (F) AP-1 transcription factor assay kit
  was used to detect cJun and cFos after 15 min of stimulation. (G) JunD and FosB
  activation were analyzed with the AP-1 transcription factor assay kit. A spike-in
  experiment was used: 12 h after Il4/IL13 stimulation, TNF was added for further
  150 min. (H) Wild-type BMDMs were pre-stimulated with JNK-IN-8 or SP600125 for 1
  h before treatment with IL4/IL13, IL4/IL13 + TNF, or TNF (15 min) started. DMSO
  was added to the control groups. Whole-cell lysates were isolated and analyzed by
  Western blotting for the indicated proteins. All values are means ± SEM; *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Statistically significant differences
  were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction. If not indicated otherwise,
  superscripts show statistical significance compared with the control group. n =
  3 biological replicates.'
