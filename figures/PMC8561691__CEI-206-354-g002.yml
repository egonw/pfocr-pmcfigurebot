caption: Altered rheumatoid arthritis (RA) B cell homeostasis and functions mediated
  by interleukin (IL)‐27 signal via activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway. (A) RA CD19+ B cells were sorted with magnetic beads and stimulated with
  IL‐27 and anti‐CD40/cytosine–phosphate–guanosine (CpG) in the presence or absence
  of anti‐IL‐27 neutralizing antibody for 72 h, and the levels of phosphorylated (p)‐mTOR
  (a), p‐P70S6K (b) and p‐4E‐BP1 (c) on CD19+ B cells were detected with flow cytometry
  assay (n = 5). (B–D) RA CD19+ B cells were sorted with magnetic beads and stimulated
  with IL‐27 antibodies with or without rapamycin in the presence of anti‐CD40/CpG,
  and the frequencies of CD19+CD27+CD24highregulatory B cells (b), CD19+CD27+CD38high
  plasmablasts (C) and CD19+CD138+ plasma cells (D) were determined with flow cytometry
  assay (n = 5). (E,F) RA CD19+ B cells were stimulated for 72 h and the supernatants
  were collected, and the levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, IL‐6 and IL‐10 were
  measured with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (n = 5). *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
