caption: Diagram of the role of DBP upregulation in HCC cell proliferation. Cytosolic
  DBP activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which induces the phosphorylation
  of FOXO3a, GSK3β, and DBP. Phosphorylated DBP can enter mitochondria, but its role
  is unknown. Phosphorylated FOXO3a and GSK3β promote the proliferation of HCC cells
  by downregulating Bim to inhibit cell apoptosis and activating GS and respiratory
  chain complex III to elevate glycogen and ATP levels, respectively. DBP in peroxisome
  is also necessary for HCC cell proliferation, independent of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway.
