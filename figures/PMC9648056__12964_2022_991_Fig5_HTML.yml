caption: Top interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and epithelial
  cells have multiple ligands and receptors associated with the PI3K-AKTsignaling
  pathway and focal adhesion. A Top ligand-receptor interactions (Commun. Probability > 0.10)
  between CAFs and epithelial cells. Heatmaps show the EnrichR pathway enrichment
  analysis for gene sets that define all CAFs ligands B and epithelial cell receptors
  C. The top 10 pathway terms (lowest adjusted P-value) were chosen from WikiPathways
  2021 and MSigDB Hallmark 2020 libraries available in EnrichR [, ]. D PI3K-AKT ligand-receptor
  interactions between CAFs and epithelial cells. E Top ligand-receptors interactions
  (Commun. Probability > 0.10) between epithelial cells and CAFs. Heatmaps showing
  the EnrichR pathway enrichment analysis for gene sets that define all epithelial
  cells ligands F and CAFs receptors G. The top 10 pathway terms (lowest adjusted
  P-value) were chosen from WikiPathways 2021 and MSigDB Hallmark 2020 libraries available
  in EnrichR [, ]. Commun. Prob., communication probability
