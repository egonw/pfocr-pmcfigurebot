caption: Metabolic potential of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained from
  anammox bacterial enrichment cultures. The figure includes MAGs in the present study
  (i.e., HBSIN, HBSAPP, JETCAE, HKUEN, and SCALA7 MAGs) and those obtained from a
  partial-nitritation anammox reactor (UTPRO, UTCFX, UTCFB, UTPLA, and UTAMX MAGs),
  a sequencing batch anammox reactor (OLB MAGs), and an up-flow column anammox reactor
  (the 317325 MAGs). MAGs with a parenthesis share >97% of the average nucleotide
  identity values. The heatmap indicates metabolic pathway completeness calculated
  using the KEGG Decoder. The taxonomic affiliations of MAGs are available at the
  top of the heatmap.
