caption: 'Overview of pathway topology analysis: MetPA-computed metabolic pathways.
  A graphical depiction of data showing all matched pathways based on p-values and
  pathway impacts. Pathways with low impact to high impact (light yellow to bright
  red, respectively) active in barley shoots (A) and roots (B) at 16 days post germination
  are described according to their significance (pathway impact).'
