caption: RNA-seq analysis of differentially expressed genes in miR-125b-5p transfected
  Tregs. Purified CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were transfected with 100 nM LV-miR-125b-5p
  or its negative control (LV-miR-NC) for 2 days, then transcriptome sequencing was
  performed. (A) The differentially expressed genes in miR-125b-5p overexpressed Tregs
  compared with control cells (n=3, each group) were shown in the heatmap. (B) The
  differentially expressed genes were shown in volcano plot. X-axis means log2 foldchange;
  Y-axis means −log10pvalue. Gray dotted line represents the screening standard threshold
  of different expressed genes. (C) The selected most upregulated and downregulated
  genes were shown in heatmap. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of enriched differentially
  expressed genes. (E) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Tregs RNA-seq data
  showed that miR-125b-5p expression levels affect regulation of immune response to
  tumor cell progression.
