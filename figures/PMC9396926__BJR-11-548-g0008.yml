caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in high- and low-risk group samples.
  a) Samples of the high-risk group were enriched in the calcium signalling pathway,
  differentiated cardiology pathway, neuroactive live receiver interaction, olfactory
  production, retinol metabolism, and other pathways. b) Samples in the low-risk group
  were enriched in myocardial contraction, citrate cycle, dilated cardiomyopathy,
  adhesive spot, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and other pathways.
