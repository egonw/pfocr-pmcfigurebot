caption: 'Downregulation of SETDB1 represses CRC tumor growth and immune cell infiltration
  in mice via the FOSB/miR-22/BATF3/PD-L1 axis. (a) Tumor volume in nude mice after
  different treatments. (b) Tumor weight in nude mice after different treatments.
  (c) miR-22 expression in tumor tissues of nude mice determined by RT-qPCR. (d) The
  protein expression of SETDB1, FOSB, BATF3, and PD-L1 in tumor tissues of nude mice
  normalized to GAPDH determined by Western blot analysis. (e) The expression of Ki-67,
  CD4, and CD8 in tumor tissues of nude mice determined by IHC, scale bar: 50 μm.
  (f) Percentage of CD8+ and IFN-γ+ in tumor tissues of nude mice analyzed by flow
  cytometry. ∗p < 0.05vs. nude mice bearing cells treated with sh-NC+OE-NC. #p < 0.05vs.
  nude mice bearing cells treated with sh-SETDB1+OE-NC. n = 10.'
