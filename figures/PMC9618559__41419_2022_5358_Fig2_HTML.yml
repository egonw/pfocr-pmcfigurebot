figure_title: Metabolic reprogramming of cells with high motile potential
caption: a KEGG pathway analysis of metabolism genes overexpressed in MHIGH cells
  versus MLOW cells highlights enrichment in pathways involved in energy production,
  oxidative stress response, extracellular matrix (ECM) modeling, and membrane composition
  rearrangements. BH-adjusted p-value < 0.05. N-S dataset analysis. b Inferred trajectory
  of GB cells from low to high motility. Cells colored by motility clusters (top panel)
  and motility score (bottom panel). MPST marks the path crossroad between low and
  high motile potential. N-S dataset analysis. c MPST overexpression in GB tissues
  (n = 163) versus normal brain tissues (n = 207). TCGA RNA-seq dataset, GEPIA2 website.
  One-way ANOVA test, *BH-adjusted p-value < 0.05. d Schematic representation of the
  metabolic pathways overrepresented in MHIGH cells compared to MLOW cells (created
  with BioRender.com). See also Tables S and S.
