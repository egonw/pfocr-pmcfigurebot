caption: 'HIBCH overexpression in hepatocytes affects cellular pathways related to
  FA metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Huh7 liver cells were transfected with
  pCMV6-HIBCH or control (pCMV6-empty vector) plasmid (0.2 μg per well in a 24-well
  plate) diluted in Opti-MEM® Reduced Serum Media and TransIT-X2® transfection reagent
  (Mirus). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with and without free FAs
  (1:1 M ratio of 50 μM PA and 50 μM OA) for 24 h before analyses. A: HIBCH expression
  in Huh7 cells measured by qPCR (n = 6). B: The quantitative values of HIBCH relative
  to α-VINCULIN in Huh7 cells (n = 3). C: Average net medium appearance per hour of
  3-HIB and valine during a 24 h period (n = 6). D: Relative FA uptake in Huh7 cells
  treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed by addition of fluorescent dodecanoic
  acid whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically after 1 h (n = 9–12). E: GSEA
  showing up-and down-regulated pathways by HIBCH overexpression relative to control
  expression (without and with FAs) in Huh7 (HALLMARK pathway analysis of RNA sequencing
  data) (n = 24). Gene sets are ordered by normalized enrichment score (NES) and significant
  adjusted p-values for each pathway are shown. F: Number of up-and down-regulated
  genes by HIBCH overexpression with/without FA treatment in Huh7 cells shown as a
  Venn diagram (adjusted p-value cutoff <0.1). FA, fatty acid treatment; NES, normalized
  enrichment score.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (–unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney
  test).'
