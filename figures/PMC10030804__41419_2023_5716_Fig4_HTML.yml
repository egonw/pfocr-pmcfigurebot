figure_title: The role of NF-κB signaling pathway in ferroptosis
caption: The classical signaling pathway is activated by Toll‑like receptor ligands
  (such as LPS), TNF, IL-1, and other stimuli. Under resting conditions, IκBα combines
  with NF-κB dimers to sequester NF-κB activity. These signaling molecules combine
  with their corresponding receptors and mediate the phosphorylation and subsequent
  degradation of IκBα. Then, the liberated NF-κB dimers are translocated to the nucleus
  and regulate target gene transcription. On the one hand, NF-κB can reduce the transcription
  of antioxidant molecules, such as GPX4, NQO1, and HMOX1, indicating the contribution
  of the NF-κB pathway to oxidative stress. On the other hand, the loss of LIFR enhances
  IκBα ubiquitination degradation and positively regulates NF-κB activation, which
  further promotes LCN2 secretion to sequester extracellular iron. In addition, a
  few agents, including BRD4770 and BAY 11-7082, exert their anti-ferroptosis effects
  via inhibiting NF-κB pathway.
