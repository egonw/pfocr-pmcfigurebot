caption: Graphical illustration summarizing the canonical renin-angiotensin system
  cascade. In brief, prorenin is released by the kidney and activates via its prorenin-receptor
  proinflammatory pathways. Angiotensinogen as acute phase protein released from the
  liver is cleaved by renin to angiotensin I which is cleaved to the octapeptide angiotensin
  II (ANG II). In mast cells, this process uses an alternative pathway using the mast-cell
  chymase (orange). ANG II then activates via its G-protein coupled AT1-receptor proinflammatory
  pathways by stimulating the JAK-Stat signaling cascade as well as the phospholipase
  gamma signaling cascade (red). By stimulating its AT2-receptor, ANG II promotes
  the activation of predominantly anti-inflammatory pathways, i.e., cGMP, phospholipase
  A, or VEGF. ACE2 degrades ANG II to angiotensin 1-7 which in turn also stimulates
  regenerative pathways via the Mas receptor.
