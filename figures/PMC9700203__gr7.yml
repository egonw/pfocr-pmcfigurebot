caption: A proposed model for ROS as a specific regulatory signal in the adaptation
  of D. cochinchinensis.An external wound leads to a burst of ROS. Excessive levels
  of ROS cause DNA damage. Most of the positively selected genes in the genome were
  enriched in DNA-repair pathways such as base excision repair, nucleotide excision
  repair, and mismatch repair; these processes play crucial roles in maintaining genomic
  integrity. ROS, as signaling molecules, also activate transcription factors, thus
  activating the flavonoid synthesis pathway to synthesize a large amount of flavonoids.
  Flavonoids are the main components of dragon’s blood and act as a defensive substance
  to resist further damage. In turn, flavonoids, together with enzymes in the ROS
  scavenging system, scavenge the excess ROS that have accumulated in vivo to maintain
  homeostasis.

  the molecular basis of its longevity and formation of dragon’s blood.
