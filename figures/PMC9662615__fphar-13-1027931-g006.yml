caption: 'Amount of viscotoxin in mg/g of fresh material (FM) of V. album mother tinctures
  prepared with plants harvested in summer (grey bars) and in winter (black bars),
  in the following locations: Rütti, Widar, Disli, Rösli, Höfli, Hiscia, Seewen, Ermitage.
  MTs were prepared with mistletoe collected from the following host trees: Malus
  domestica. (A) Quercus sp. (B) Ulmus carpinifolia. (C) Abies alba. (D) and Pinus
  sylvestris (E). Comparison of the viscotoxin content from the different host trees
  in the same location, Rüti. (F) The numbers added to Rütti and Ermitage locations
  represent V. album from different host-trees harvested in the same location. *p
  ≤ 0.05; ***p < 0.0001.'
