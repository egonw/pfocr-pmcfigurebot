caption: Overview of mechanisms from mouse and human studies that reveal how “the
  brakes on TLRs” are established in the neonatal gut. (1) Human milk components such
  as lactoferrin and secretory IgA inhibit growth of pathogenic microbes that can
  activate TLR signaling. (2) Epidermal growth factor and glutamine in breastmilk
  enhance intestinal epithelial barrier by inducing mucin production and tight junction
  protein activity. (3) HMOs present in human milk promote growth of commensal microbes
  such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus. (4) The intestinal epithelial barrier—which
  includes mucin, antimicrobial peptides, and tight junction proteins—acts as a physical
  barrier that separates pathogenic microbes from the developing gut. (5) SCFAs, produced
  in part from the fermentation of HMOs by commensal bacteria, induce mucosal mechanisms
  such as increased mucin production to help repress intestinal TLR sensitivity. (6)
  Commensals such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, whose growth was promoted
  in part by HMOs, induce negative regulators of TLR4 (SIGIRR, A20, TOLLIP) to suppress
  TLR4 activity in the gut. (7) Development of postnatal tolerance to LPS through
  reduced surface TLR4 expression and repression of IRAK1. (8) Postnatal induction
  of genes that inhibit intestinal TLR signaling (SIGIRR, A20, TOLLIP) helps prevent
  aberrant intestinal TLR activation to colonizing microbes. (9) Postnatal repression
  of IRAK1 through SIGIRR-STAT3-miR-146a pathway dampens TLR4 signaling and contributes
  to LPS tolerance. (10) Developmental increase in IκB sequesters NFκB in the cytoplasm
  preventing its transcriptional activation. (11) Compartmentalization of TLRs in
  the basolateral membrane of IECs decreases TLR activation from bacteria in the apical
  lumen. HMOs = human milk oligosaccharides; IEC = intestinal epithelial cell; Ig
  = immunoglobulin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; NEC = necrotizing enterocolitis; SCFAs
  = Short-chain fatty acids; Th = T helper; TLR = toll-like receptor.
