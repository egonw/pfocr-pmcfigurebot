caption: The radiosensitivity of BxPC3-RR cells with induced ZFP57 overexpression
  was evaluated by detecting cancer cell proliferation and viability after transfection
  with pc DNA 3.0 and exposure to different irradiation doses. (a) The ZFP57 expression
  was determined in BxPC3-RR cells transfected with pc DNA 3.0 ZFP57 and the corresponding
  control. The BxPC3-P cells transfected with sh-ZFP57-2 and the corresponding control
  were exposed to 8 Gy irradiation. Then, (b) the survival fraction of the BxPC3-RR
  cells was estimated by colony formation assay. (c) CCK-8 assay was performed to
  assess the BxPC3-RR cell viability. (d) WB assay was performed to determine the
  expressions of cyclin D1 and CDK4 (cell cycle-related proteins); Bax, Bcl-2, and
  cleaved caspase-3 (apoptosis-related proteins); γ-H2AX (DNA repair-related protein);
  and (e) β-catenin and c-Myc expressions. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.
