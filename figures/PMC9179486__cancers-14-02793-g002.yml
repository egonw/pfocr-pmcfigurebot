caption: Pleiotropic kynurenine protumoral functions. Kynurenine production, resulting
  from IDO and/or TDO induction, leads to the AhR receptor activation to promote cancer
  cell proliferation, chromosomal instability, neoangiogenesis, immune evasion, metastatic
  dissemination and chemoresistance. AhR-independent functions of kynurenine also
  promote tumor growth. Tryptophan depletion, resulting from the kynurenine pathway
  activation, additionally contributes to the establishment of an immune tolerant
  environment.
