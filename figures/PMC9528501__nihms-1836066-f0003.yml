caption: Viability as determined by CTG of PC9GR cells plated in RPMI10 containing
  10 μg/mL (A) rhIGFBP5 (n=6), (B) rhIGFBP6 (n=6) or (C) rhIGFBP7 (n=7) and treated
  after 24 hours with 100 nM osimertinib for 72 hours. 100% viability is set to total
  luminescence in DMSO-treated cells plated in RPMI10 containing PBS. PBS treatments
  (DMSO and osimertinib) in panels A and B are the same as IGFBP5 and 6 experiments
  were performed in parallel. (D) Viability as determined by CTG of PC9GR cells plated
  in RPMI10 containing 100 ng/mL IGF1 or IGF2 and treated 24 hours later with osimertinib
  (100 nM for 72 hours). 100% viability was set to total luminescence in DMSO-treated
  cells plated in RPMI10 containing 0.1%BSA/PBS as buffer control. n=6 experiments.
  (E) Viability as determined by CTG of PC9GR cells plated in 1:1 RPMI10:siCM (from
  CAF12 cells in which IGFBP5 was silenced) and treated 24 hours later with osimertinib
  (100 nM for 72 hours). 100% viability is set to total luminescence in DMSO-treated
  cells plated in 1:1 RPMI10:si-NT CM. n=7 experiments. A representative Western blot
  confirming knockdown efficiency is shown. Technical replicates within each experiment
  in (A-E) were averaged before determining the mean ± SD and significance across
  all biological replicates (n). P<0.05 by unpaired t test with single pooled variance.
