caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of carotenoid glucosides. The biosynthetic pathway:
  module 1 AHT, including atoB, hmgS and thmgR; module 2 MPPI, including mevk, pmk,
  pmd and idi; module 3 EBIA, including crtEBI and ispA (Zhang et al. ); and module
  4 YZX or YZWX, including crtYZX or crtYZWX. Dashed arrow indicates multiple enzymatic
  steps. The glycosylation of all carotenoids required UDP-glucose (UDP-glc), here
  we only used zeaxanthin glucosides as representatives. The genes expressed encode
  the following enzymes: crtY, lycopene beta-cyclase; crtW, β-carotene ketolase; crtZ,
  β-carotene hydroxylase; crtX, zeaxanthin glucosyltransferase (ZGT). Thicker and
  thinner arrows represent the higher and lower carbon flux, respectively; gray arrows
  represent that the metabolites (e.g., β-cryptoxanthin-β-D-glucoside and 3′-hydroxyechinenone-β-D-glucoside)
  were not detected in our strains'
