caption: 'The overexpression of constitutively active PI3K p110α rescued malignant
  phenotypes impaired by RGS20 depletion. (a) Western blotting analysis on the expression
  of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway proteins after transfection with empty vector (EV),
  PI3K p110α Myr, or PI3K p110α KD plasmids in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1cells.
  (b) CCK-8 analysis on cell viability after PI3K p110α Myr and KD plasmids transfection
  in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1 cells. The cell viability in Scr control was regards
  as 100%. n = 4, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, as compared with EV. (c) Soft agar assay on clonogenesis
  after PI3K p110α Myr and KD plasmids transfection in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1
  cells. The soft agar clonogenesis in Scr control was regards as 100%. n = 4, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001, as compared with EV. (d) Caspase-3 activity after PI3K p110α Myr and KD
  plasmid transfection in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1 cells. The caspase-3 activity
  in Scr control was regards as 100%. n = 4, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, as compared with EV. (e)
  Wound healing assay on PC cells following PI3K p110α Myr and KD plasmid transfection
  in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1 cells. Bars: 100 μm. The cell migration in Scr
  control was regards as 100%. n = 4, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, as compared with EV. (f) Transwell
  invasion assay on PC cells following PI3K p110α Myr and KD plasmid transfection
  in RGS20-depleted 149RM and Penl1 cells. Bars: 50 μm. The cell invasion in Scr control
  was regards as 100%. n = 4, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, as compared with EV.'
