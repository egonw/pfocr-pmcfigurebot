caption: The total Monascus pigments and citrinin production (A), and extracellular
  Monascus pigments production (B) by the parent strain M. purpureus LQ-6 and recombination
  strains in submerged fermentation for 10 days at 30 Â°C and agitated at 150 rpm in
  the dark. Different letters (a and b) up the columns in the group of same strain
  are considered statistically different (p < 0.05), but the columns marked a or b
  to ab are considered insignificant difference.
