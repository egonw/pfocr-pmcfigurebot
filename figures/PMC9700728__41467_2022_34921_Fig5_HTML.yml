figure_title: Differential processes of MPL activation
caption: 'A Time-dependent activation of MPL-downstream molecules in Ba/F3-HuMpl cells
  treated with ThC (1 μg/mL) and TPO (3 ng/mL). Phosphorylation of STAT5 and AKT was
  monitored at the indicated times after the addition of an agonist. Three independent
  experiments were performed, and similar results were obtained (see source data file).
  B Relative amount of MPL on the cell surface 0, 10, 30, 120, 240, and 360 min after
  the addition of ThC (1 μg/mL) and TPO (3 ng/mL) was measured with three independent
  experiments, bars indicate mean ± SD. Relative surface MPL at 240 and 360 min between
  ThC and TPO differed significantly, with P = 0.030 and 0.057, respectively, two-tailed
  paired t-test. For immunoblot data, see Supplementary Fig. . C Synergistic effects
  observed in each combination of agonists in the Ba/F3-HuMpl cell proliferation assay.
  Concentration–response curves for tested agonists in the absence or presence of
  fixed subactivation concentrations of ThC (0.1 μg/mL) (upper trace). The ratios
  of absorptions with and without ThC (0.1 μg/mL) are plotted (lower trace). EC50
  values for, with and without ThC are, 0.4 (95% CI of 0.2–0.7) and 2.8 (95% CI of
  2.1–3.7) ng/mL, respectively. Non-liner fit variable slope with three parameters
  were used. D Proposed mechanisms of activation by two mechanistically discrete agonists,
  TPO and ThC: (I) Schematic depiction of MPL. Monomeric MPL has four N-glycosylation
  sites at N117, 178, 298, and 358; (II) ligand-bound monomeric state with each TPO
  and ThC; (III) ligand-bound nonactivated state; and (IV) dimeric signaling complexes.'
