caption: TMT-labeled proteomics analysis. (A) The general flow of proteomic analysis.
  Proteins in SW1990 cells treated with 128N and 128C TMT were labeled with GEM and
  combined G-6 and GEM, respectively. Labeled proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and
  differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics. (B) Differentially
  expressed proteins were obtained by sample analysis. (C) The differentially expressed
  proteins were enriched and analyzed. (D) GO enrichment analysis.
