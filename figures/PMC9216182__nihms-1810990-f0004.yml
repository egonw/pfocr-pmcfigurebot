figure_title: Effects of Myeloid cell-specific Smad7 loss on the gene expression profile
  of infarct macrophages
caption: 'A-D: RNA-seq was used to compare the transcriptional profile of infarct
  macrophages harvested from MyS7KO and Smad7 fl/fl infarcted hearts, 3 and 7 days
  after coronary occlusion. Volcano plots demonstrate upregulation of 291 genes and
  downregulation of 464 genes in Smad7 KO macrophages 3 days after myocardial infarction
  (A). 867 genes were upregulated and 613 genes were downmodulated by macrophage-specific
  loss of Smad7 at the 7-day post-infarction timepoint (B). C-D: the number of genes
  up and down regulated in MyS7KO infarct macrophages. E: Ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA) of the transcriptomic data at the 7-day timepoint identified 3 canonical pathways
  that were differentially regulated by Smad7 loss (with an absolute z score >2).
  The semaphorin pathway was predicted to be activated in Smad7 KO cells, whereas
  TREM1 signaling and oxidative phosphorylation were predicted to be inhibited.'
