caption: 'Screening of target genes by chip detection. A: Signal strength distribution
  curve diagram, with the cross coordinates representing the probe signal strength
  range and the longitudinal coordinates representing the number of probe sets within
  the signal strength range; B: Relative line ram of the logarithmic signal strength,
  with the horizontal coordinate representing the sample name, the vertical coordinate
  indicating the relative logarithmic signal strength, the red line in the middle
  representing the average of the relative logarithmic signal strength of all samples,
  and the upper and lower horizontal lines representing the 90% confidence interval.
  The upper and lower edges represent the upper and lower quartiles, and the black
  line in the middle represents the median; C: Distribution diagram of the Pearson
  correlation coefficient among samples. The correlation coefficient indicates a positive
  correlation of the expression mode of genes in two subjects, and a negative value
  indicates an expression mode with a negative correlation. As the absolute value
  of the correlation coefficient approaches 1.0, the correlation increases; D: Principal
  component analysis. Red dots represent normal purpose cells with centromere protein
  K (CENPK) gene short hairpin RNA virus infection (KD) samples, and green dots represent
  normal purpose cells infected with CENPK negative control virus (NC) samples; E:
  Scatter diagram. The cross coordinate represents the NC group, and the vertical
  coordinate represents the KD group; F: Volcano map, where the cross coordinate is
  a difference multiple (the logarithmic change in the bottom 2); longitudinal significance
  false discovery rate (FDR) (of the difference in the bottom 10 Logarithmic change);
  significantly different genes screened by |fold change| â‰¥ 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 in
  red, and other genes with no significant difference in gray; G: Cluster analysis
  results. Each column represents a sample, and each row represents a differentially
  expressed gene; H: Statistics for the classical pathway enrichment analysis. The
  transverse coordinate is the path name and the longitudinal significance level of
  enrichment (negative logarithmic transformation in the bottom 10).'
