caption: Phylogenetic analysis of JR48. (A,B) Phylogenetic tree based on the partial
  16S rRNA gene (A) and gyrB gene (B) sequences of JR48. Phylogenetic tree was constructed
  by MEGA 7.0 software using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates.
  The percentage numbers at the nodes indicate the levels of the associated taxa clustered
  together. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths were proportional to the
  number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The scale bar indicates 0.005 (A) and
  0.03 (B) nucleotide substitutions per site. T, type strain.

  plant resistance to the crucifer black rot via a salicylic acid-dependent signaling
  pathway.
