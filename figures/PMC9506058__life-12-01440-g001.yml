caption: APP amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing pathways. In the nonamyloidogenic
  pathway, APP is cleaved by α-secretase to produce a soluble amino-terminal of the
  amyloid precursor protein, as well as a C-terminal fragment (C83) that can subsequently
  be cleaved by γ-secretase to produce the p3 extracellular fragment and amyloid precursor
  protein intracellular domain (AICD). In the amyloidogenic pathway, β-secretase cleaves
  APP to generate the soluble amyloid precursor protein β- and a C-terminal fragment
  (C99). Then, the cleavage of C99 by γ-secretase leads to the release of amyloid-β
  and AICD.
