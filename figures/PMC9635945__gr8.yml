caption: The hypoxia pathway transcriptional gene expression in K18-hACE2 mice challenged
  with SARS-CoV-2 and variantsK18-hACE2 mice of both sexes (1:1 ratio) were injected
  intraperitoneally with 200 μL/mouse of PBS (mock-transferred) or pooled human post-vaccination
  sera collected at 1-month after the 2nd dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (post-vac
  sera transferred). Recipient mice were then challenged intranasally with 103 TCID50/mouse
  of New York-PV09158/2020 (NY (614G)), or 102 TCID50/mouse of Kappa and Delta variants.
  Hypoxia signaling pathway PCR array was performed using RNA extracted from lung
  homogenates of infected mice (n = 6 mice/group, female vs male at 1:1 ratio) 5 days
  post-infection (dpi). Gene regulation as fold changes over uninfected naïve mice
  (n = 3 mice/group including 2 females and 1 male) was used to construct the volcano
  plots (A, C, and E) or correlation plots (B, D, and F). The dashed lines indicate
  the thresholds of p value < 0.05. Selected genes that show a significant rise (red)
  or fall (blue) are highlighted.
