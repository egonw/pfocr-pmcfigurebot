caption: The genetic context of saoABC operon and variability of sequences of the
  encoded proteins among 47 staphylococcal species. (A) Upstream of saoABC operon
  there is an operon coding for xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (xpt), purine permease
  (pbuX), IMP dehydrogenase (guaB) and glutamine-hydrolyzing GMP synthase (guaA),
  genes coding for proteins related to de novo guanine biosynthesis and the purine
  salvage pathway. Downstream, genes coding for glycine oxidase (thiO), L-cystine
  transporter (tcyP), oxygen-insensitive NADPH nitroreductase (nfrA) as well as an
  operon coding for alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunits C (peroxiredoxin, ahpC)
  and F (ahpF). Dashed lines represent variable sequence fragments where other genes
  are found on a species-specific basis. Upstream of saoABC operon genes a few conserved
  motifs are found. Next to promoters for σA (PsigA) and σB (PsigB) as well as ribosome
  binding sites (RBS) unknown to date in staphylococci motifs are observed. These
  include a putative promoter for an unknown putative σX factor (PsigX) and a conserved
  span of sequence containing a palindromic repeat. (B) Conservation plots of SaoA,
  SaoB and SaoC protein sequences show that whereas SaoA and SaoB protein sequences
  are conserved among different staphylococcal species, SaoC sequence displays an
  unusual pattern of conservation with approximately 150 aa N-terminal fragment and
  a short 12 aa C-terminal motif being conserved, and the remaining span of the sequence
  variable in respect to amino acid sequence as well as its length. (C) Pairwise sequence
  similarity among SaoA, SaoB and SaoC protein sequences (top) and their relative
  length (bottom). SaoA and SaoB sequences are conserved and of very similar lengths
  among all analysed staphylococcal species with SaoB sequence being the most conserved
  of all three. On the other hand, SaoC sequence is relatively less conserved and
  of highly variable length with discernible short and long variants.
