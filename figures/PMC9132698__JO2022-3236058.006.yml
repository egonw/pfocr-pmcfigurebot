caption: 'Clinical drug responses were evaluated in the patient-derived primary culture
  GBM cells. (a) Most of the primary culture cancer cells were CD133 (green) and SOX2
  (red), highly expressed using flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence assay.
  Hoechst33342-labeled nuclei. Bar = 50 μm. MFI: mean fluorescent intensity. (b) Flow
  cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence assay in GBM primary cultured spheroid
  cells to detect the high expression of CD133 (green) and SOX2 (red) cultured with
  serum-free medium. Hoechst33342-labeled nuclei. Bar = 50 μm. MFI: mean fluorescent
  intensity. (c) Primary culture cancer cells, treated with (Z)-BP and temozolomide
  (active form MTIC was used), presented relatively low IC50, compared to BCNU. Additionally,
  dosing (Z)-BP in IC30 concentration could reduce the required amount of TMZ for
  determining the synergistic effect on eliminating primary culture gliomas. (d) Using
  (Z)-BP (200 or 400 μM) to expose the primary culture cells could reduce the level
  of MGMT, in comparison to vehicle control and BCNU (800 μM). Further, receptor tyrosine
  kinases including EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, and Axl were also downregulated. Upstream
  mTOR activity was inactivated (p-mTOR) by (Z)-BP, and this could mutually affect
  Axl and EGFR signaling and then decrease the protein level of PD-L1. β-Actin was
  used as an internal control.'
