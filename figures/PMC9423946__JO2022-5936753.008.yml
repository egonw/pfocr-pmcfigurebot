caption: TRIM50 overexpression impeded tumor growth by influencing the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway in vivo. After SGC-7901 cells were transfected with pLVX-Puro-TRIM50 or
  vector, the cells were subcutaneously implanted to the nude mice to set up a xenograft.
  (a) Tumor volume was recorded at an interval of 3 days from the 7th day and the
  tumor weight was valued after 31 days of injection. (b) TRIM50, β-catenin, Cyclin
  D1, c-Myc, and E-cadherin expression in the tumor tissues was detected by Western
  blot after 31 days of injection. Two-tailed Student's-test was utilized for intergroup
  comparisons. ▲p < 0.05 and ▲▲p < 0.01vs. Vector. Results were presented as mean ± SD.
  n = 6.
