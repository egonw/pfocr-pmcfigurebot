caption: 'CDC42- and RAC1-stimulated membrane remodeling is involved in HSV-1 infection.
  (A) HSV-1 infection induces the activation of the CDC42-RAC1-Cofilin signaling pathway.
  HCE cells were infected with HSV-1 (MOI = 2). Cells were lysed at indicated time
  points to detect the CDC42-RAC1-Cofilin activation pathway and viral ICP4 and gD
  proteins using Western blotting. GAPDH was used as an internal loading control.
  (B) HSV-1 infection promotes a dynamic change in membrane remodeling. HCE cells
  were infected with HSV-1 (MOI = 2) and fixed at different time points for membrane
  remodeling using F-actin staining. Scale bar: 5 μm (C) F-actin inhibitor CytoD inhibits
  HSV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner. HCE cells were pretreated with different
  concentrations of CytoD or DMSO at 37 °C for 1 h, then infected with HSV-1 (MOI
  = 2) for 24 h. Viral titers were measured using TCID50. Data represent the results
  from three independent experiments in triplicate (Mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, ns, not significant). Viral gD protein levels in HSV-1 infected cells treated
  with CytoD (4 μg/mL) or DMSO were measured using Western blotting. Mock-treated
  and control cells served as the negative and blank controls, respectively (D); cells
  treated as in C were fixed for IFA visualization of membrane remodeling and virus
  infection using F-actin and viral gD protein staining. Mock-treated cells served
  as the negative control (E).'
