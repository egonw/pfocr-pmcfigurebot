caption: Role of PD-1/PD-L1. PD-1-expressing macrophages exhibit an anti- inflammatory-like
  surface profile in tumor settings. PD-1 expression is negatively correlated to phagocytic
  ability of macrophages. PD-L1 antibody treatment promotes cell proliferation of
  cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages, which is related to the activation of
  the AKT-mTOR pathway. PD-1, programmed cell death 1; PD-L1, programmed cell death
  ligand 1.
