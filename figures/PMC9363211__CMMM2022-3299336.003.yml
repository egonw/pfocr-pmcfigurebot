caption: (a) NUTM2A-AS1 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells.
  (b) The relative mRNA expression of Trim4, Trim 7, Trim22, and Trim 37 under knockdown
  NUTM2A-AS1. (c) The expression of trim37 was detected by western blot under knockdown
  NUTM2A-AS1. (d) The interaction between NUTM2A-AS1 and RNA binding protein SRSF1
  was detected by RIP assay. (e) The interaction between SRSF1 protein and trim37mRNA
  was explored by RIP assay. (f) The mRNA stability of trim37 was assessed by MRNA
  stability test, âˆ—P < 0.05.
article_title: lncRNA NUTM2A-AS1 Targets the SRSF1/Trim37 Signaling Pathway to Promote
  the Proliferation and Invasion of Breast Cancer.
