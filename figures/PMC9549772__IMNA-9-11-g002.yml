  inhibiting EMT through suppressing Notch2, Wnt/β-catenin, p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
  It is reported that some CHMs contribute to reductions in TGF-β1 expression and
  Smad2/3 phosphorylation and increases in Smad7 expression. CHM, Chinese herbal medicines;
  TGF, transforming growth factor; MAPK, Mitogen-activated protein kinase; NICD2,
