caption: 'ZNF281 transcriptionally regulates CCL2 and CCL5 expression in CAFs. (A)
  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of lncSNHG5 in the KEGG pathway using TCGA data.
  (B) Venn diagram showing the cytokines as ZNF281 putative targets in CAFs. (C-D)
  qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to test the mRNA (C) and protein (D) expression
  levels of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGFA in CAFs/shNC, CAFs/shZNF281, CAFs/sh lncSNHG5 and
  CAFs/sh lncSNHG5/ZNF281. (E-G) ELISA was used to detect CCL2 (E), CCL5 (F) and VEGFA
  (G) protein levels in supernatant from the indicated engineered CAFs. (H-I) Schematic
  diagram depicting the predicted binding sites and sequences of ZNF281 in the CCL2
  (H) and CCL5 (I) promoters. The relative luciferase activity was detected in CAFs
  transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant luciferase reporter plasmids of CCL2 or
  CCL5. (J-K) ChIP-qPCR assay to determine ZNF281 binding to the CCL2 (J) and CCL5
  (K) promoters using an anti-ZNF281 antibody. IgG was used as a negative control.
  Data represent the mean Â± SD (ns: no significance, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).'
