caption: 'MK2206 2HCl suppressed MC infiltration and microvascular density in 4NQO-induced
  mouse tongue tumors. (a) MK2206 2HCl inhibited MC infiltration by toluidine blue
  staining. (b) MK2206 2HCl inhibited the microvascular density by IHC. All data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as compared with the blank group, ##P < 0.01
  as compared with the 4NQO+captisol group. Magnification ×400.'
