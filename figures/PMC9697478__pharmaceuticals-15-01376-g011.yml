caption: 'The effects of C29, TAK242 on BRHE induced phosphorylation (JNK, ERK, p65
  (NFkB) and STAT3) and cytokine mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells. The RAW 264.7
  cells were pre-treated with different C29 and TAK242 concentrations for 30 min and
  then treated with BRHE for 40 min. Representative pictures of Western blot (A),
  quantitative analyses (B) and cellular mRNA expression analysis using qPCR (C).
  Each immunoreactive band was digitized and expressed as a ratio of JNK, ERK, and
  p65 protein levels. Data are expressed as mean Â± SD of three independent experiments.
  ## p < 0.01 versus control; ** p < 0.01 versus BRHE treatment alone.'
