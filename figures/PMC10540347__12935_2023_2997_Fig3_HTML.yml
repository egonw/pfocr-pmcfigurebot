caption: Alteration of SQLE and the association between SQLE expression and immune
  cell infiltration in BCa. (A) Alteration frequency of SQLE in BCa and pan-cancer.
  (B) The mutation sites, types of mutation, and alteration frequency of SQLE somatic
  mutation in BCa. (C) The correlation between tumor mutation burden and expression
  of SQLE. (D) The stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores were different between low-expression
  SQLE and high-expression SQLE. (E) SQLE expression was positively associated with
  CD4 + Th2 T cells, plasma cells, CD8 + T cells, and macrophage infiltration in BCa
  and negatively correlated with CD4 + T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
  and NK cells. (F) Gene expression after ICB treatment and in responders and non-responders
  in different tumor models. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
