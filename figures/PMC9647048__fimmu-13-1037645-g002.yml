caption: ITAM receptor downstream signalling pathway. CLEC-2 and GPVI share common
  downstream pathways, with activation leading to platelet aggregation and degranulation,
  through PLC, PKC and calcium signalling. C-type lectin-like receptor 2, CLEC2; Glycoprotein
  VI, GPVI; Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, ITAM; Phosphate, P; Src
  family kinase, SFK; Phospholipase C, PLC; Protein kinase C, PKC.
