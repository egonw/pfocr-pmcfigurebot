caption: 'Effect of overexpression or interference with the expression of PDGFRB in
  mammary epithelial cells on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (a) The proliferation
  of mammary epithelial cells was detected by EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) staining
  assay. (b) The bar plot shows statistics of cell proliferation for different groups.
  (c–g) The bar plots show the expression of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway members after
  interference or overexpression of PDGFRB, respectively. (h) Western blotting was
  used to detect the expression of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway members after interference
  or overexpression of PDGFRB. si-NC: native control of small interfering RNA (empty
  vector of siRNA); si-PDGFRB: small interfering RNA targeting PDGFRB; NC: native
  control (empty vector of pcDNA3.1); PDGFRB: PDGFRB overexpression vector. * indicates
  p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, NS indicates not significant, the data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 3).'
