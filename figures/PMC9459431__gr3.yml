caption: 'Melatonin mitigated isoflurane-induced hippocampal neuro apoptosis in neonatal
  rats. (A) Western blot bands of apoptosis signaling in the hippocampus. (B) The
  treatment of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane induced increase of pro-apoptosis
  factor Bax expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 71.360, P < 0.001).
  (C) The treatment of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane induced decrease
  of anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3,
  20) = 9.573, P < 0.001). (D) The treatment of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane
  induced increase of pro-apoptosis factor cleaved-caspase 3 expression in hippocampus
  of neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 19.910, P < 0.001). (E) The treatment of melatonin
  significantly increase isoflurane induced decrease of synaptic protein PSD95 expression
  in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 73.790, P < 0.001) (F) Immunofluorescence
  results of cleaved-caspase 3 and caspase 12 in hippocampus of all four groups rats.
  Expressions of cleaved-caspase 3 and caspase 12 in all four groups were presented
  through bar graphs: (G) for cleaved-caspase 3 (F(3, 20) = 109.100, P < 0.001) and
  (H) for caspase 12 (F(3, 20) = 105.200, P < 0.001). Data were presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 6). ∗denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗denotes p < 0.01, ∗∗∗denotes p < 0.001 when
  comparing the two groups under each end of the capped line. Scale bar = 500 μm.'
