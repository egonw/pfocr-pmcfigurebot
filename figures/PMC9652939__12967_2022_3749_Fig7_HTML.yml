caption: p-TBC1D1Ser660 promoted malignant activities could be inhibited by FZD7 interference.
  A, B Cell proliferative capability was determined by CCK-8 (A) and EdU (B) assays.
  C, D Cell metastatic and invasive capability were determined by wound healing (C)
  and Transwell (D) assays. E TOP/FOP flash assay was conducted on indicate cells
  to evaluate the effect of FZD7 on WNT/β-catenin signaling. F Western blot analysis
  was conducted on indicated cells to evaluate the effect of FZD7 on WNT/β-catenin
  signaling. Data represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments and were analyzed
  by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
article_title: MICAL1 facilitates pancreatic cancer proliferation, migration, and
  invasion by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway.
