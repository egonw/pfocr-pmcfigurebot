figure_title: Protective and pathological functions of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
caption: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can exert protective functions, such as neutralization,
  antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC). Neutralizing antibody titers are higher in patients with severe disease
  than in those with mild disease patients, and these antibodies are detected until
  1-year post-symptom onset (PSO); however, their levels decrease more rapidly in
  patients with mild disease. Serum from non-hospitalized patients and convalescent
  plasma from patients who have recovered display more Fc-dependent effector functions,
  such as ADP and ADCC, than serum from hospitalized patients. The pathological effects
  of antibodies in COVID-19 are related in part to aberrant glycosylation patterns,
  which are observed in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies of patients with severe,
  but not mild disease. These structural modifications can trigger inflammatory processes,
  such as cytokine production, immune cell infiltration into the lungs, or platelet-mediated
  thrombosis. These aberrant glycosylation patterns increase the affinity of antibodies
  for the C1q protein, thereby leading to activation of the classical complement pathway,
  and increases in affinity for FcγR enhance Fc-dependent functions, such as neutrophil
  extracellular trap formation (NETosis), which is associated with higher levels of
  inflammation. (Created with www.Biorender.com).
