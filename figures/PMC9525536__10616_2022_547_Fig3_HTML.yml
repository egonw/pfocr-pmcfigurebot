caption: Analysis of differentiation-inducing potential of HPLC purified peak fractions.
  A Different peak fractions (P1–P5) and parent fraction Mc2-Ac-hex (HF) (20 µg/ml
  each) were assessed for their differentiation-inducing potential by NBT reduction
  assay at 96 h. B HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of P3 and
  were scored for NBT positive cells at 96 h. DMSO at 0.18% and 1.2% was included
  as vehicle control (VC) and Positive control, respectively. C Cytotoxicity analysis
  of P3. HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of P3 and cell viability
  was measured using MTT reduction assay. Doxorubicin (Dx) at 10 µM was included as
  a positive control. Percent cytotoxicity is calculated with respect to untreated
  cells. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, performed
  in triplicates. Ordinary One-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons) was performed
  to calculate the significant difference with respect to VC. *p ≤ 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001
