caption: MALAT1 targets and negatively regulates miR-598â€“3p. The lowly expressed miR-383-5p,
  miR-503-5p, and miR-598-3p in Y79 cells and HXO-RB44 cells were screened with (A)
  reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The (B)
  online software TargetScan predicted the binding site of MALAT1 to miR-598-3p, and
  the mutation site was designed. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-598-3p was
  verified with the luciferase (C) reporter assay. The regulatory effect of MALAT1
  on miR-598-3p in Y79 cells and HXO-RB44 cells was examined with (D) RT-qPCR. *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01.
article_title: The long noncoding RNA MALAT1/microRNA-598-3p axis regulates the proliferation
  and apoptosis of retinoblastoma cells through the PI3K/AKT pathway.
