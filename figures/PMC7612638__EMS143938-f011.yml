caption: To test whether H3K4me3 could co-exist with H3K27me3 in the same individual
  cells prior to chemotherapy exposure, we performed successive immunoprecipitation
  of H3K27me3 with H3K4me3 (or vice-versa) or H3K27me3 (or H3K4me3) with isotype control
  (IgG) on mono-nucleosome chromatin. In MDA-MB-468 cells, we detected 1,547 TSSs
  significantly enriched in DNA immunoprecipitated with both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3,
  compared to the control (H3K27me3/IgG) precipitated fraction (peak-ratio > 0.15,
  q-value < 10-3, ). We found that bivalent chromatin in untreated cells was detected
  at TSSs of genes associated to mammary stem cell and EMT pathways, as well as various
  developmental pathways (e.g. Hedgehog pathway, ). The majority of H3K27me3-regulated
  persister genes (26 out of 37), including the 3 candidate master TFs, were found
  in a bivalent chromatin configuration in the untreated cell population (e.g. TGF-β1,
  FOXQ1, FOSL1, ,  and Supplementary Table 4). We next studied bivalent chromatin
  landscapes in additional TNBC cell lines (HCC38 & BT20, ), in our 3 PDX models and
  n = 9 patient samples – 3 of which correspond to the tumors used for PDX derivation
  (Patient_95, Patient_39 & Patient_172) (, ). We confirm the existence of bivalent
  programs in all patient tumors, and show that paired PDX models recapitulate bivalency
  of patient samples (). Bivalent chromatin is also found at genes implicated in EMT
  and mammary stem cell identity, and developmental pathways (, ) and at candidate
  master TFs of the persister programs – FOXQ1, KLF4 or TFCP2L1 – (, ). With a continuum
  of epigenomic datasets, from patients to PDX, we demonstrate that cancer cells display
  a set of bivalent TSSs, which could lead to the rapid activation of an entire persister
  expression program upon therapeutic stress.
