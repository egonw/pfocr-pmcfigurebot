caption: Pathways, related to the microenvironment, including interferon signaling,
  immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and lymphoid cell, complement cascade,
  FCGR3A mediated IL10 synthesis, chemokine receptors bind chemokine, IL3 IL-5 and
  GM-CSF signaling, type II interferon signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, NKT
  pathway, and TNFs bind their physiological receptors were showed significantly differential
  enrichment in PTPRN high and low expression groups based on NES, FDR, and p-value.
