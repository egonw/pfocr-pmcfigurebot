caption: The efficiency of BMP4 overexpression and knockdown plasmid transfection
  into granular cells. (A) Granular cells transfected with PCDNA3.1-EGFP as NC. (B)
  Granular cells transfected with shRNA232. (C) Granular cells transfected with shRNA742.
  (D) Granular cells transfected with pEGFP-BMP4. (E) Transfection efficiency of granular
  cells with BMP4 overexpression or knockdown plasmids. (F) Relative expression of
  BMP4 in granular cells transfected with each plasmid, WT means granular cells without
  any transfection treatment.
