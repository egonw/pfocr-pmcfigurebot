caption: Impact of LRRC32 gene expression on immune landscape in human cancers and
  ICB responsiveness. (A–C) TCGA analysis. (A) Correlation of LRRC32 expression level
  with indicated immune pathways in multiple human cancer types. Values in each cell
  indicates t-statistics comparing the top 1/3 vs the bottom 1/3 LRRC32 expression
  groups. Numbers in the heatmap indicated t-statistics result, and >2 or < −2 are
  statistically significant in a positively or negatively correlated manner, respectively.
  (B) Correlation of immune subtypes between LRRC32 expression and non-small cell
  lung cancer. (C1. Wound healing. C2. IFN-γ dominant. C3. Inflammatory. C4. Lymphocyte
  depleted. C6. TGF-β dominant) (C) Box plots comparing related immune pathway enrichment
  in human lung cancers between high and low LRRC32 gene expression groups. Statistical
  significance was determined using t-tests for A and C, and Fisher’s exact test for
  B. (D–F) Bulk RNA-seq data analysis of pre-treatment tumor samples from 167 patients
  with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who received atezolizumab in phase two clinical
  trial (IMvigor210). (D) Box plots comparing the expression of LRRC32 gene (left)
  and LRRC32-TGFB related signatures (right, defined in ) in all types, immune-desert,
  excluded and inflamed tumors. Responders (CR/PR) in red and non-responders (SD/PD)
  in blue. (E, F) Kaplan-Meier survival plots comparing overall survival probability
  (y-axis) and follow-up time (months, x-axis) in all cancer types including immune-desert,
  excluded, inflamed tumors. Groups were split by high (red) and low (green) expression
  levels of LRRC32 gene (E) or LRRC32-TGFB related gene signatures (F). Significance
  was determined by using t-test for D, and log rank tests for E, F. *p<0.05; **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. CR, complete response; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial
  response; SD, stable disease.
