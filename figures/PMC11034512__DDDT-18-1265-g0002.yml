caption: 'Influences exerted by OB on CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia. Thermal pain
  sensitivity was at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 days after CFA injection. (A) The ipsilateral
  thermal hyperalgesia was remarkably alleviated by OB treatment. (B) no marked difference
  on contralateral side. The data obtained are represented as the means Â± SD. **P
  < 0.01 when compared to the control. ##P < 0.01 when compared to CFA group, n =
  7 per group.'
