caption: 'Pp-EE targeting Src of the NF-κB signal pathway. (A–C) RAW264.7 cells were
  pretreated with Pp-EE (150 µg/mL) for 30 min and induced an inflammatory response
  by LPS (1 μg/mL) at different times. Phosphorylation level and total level of IκBα,
  AKT, p85, Src, and Syk were detected by Western blot. (D) Verification in HEK293T
  cells with HA-Src over-expression. Total and phospho-forms of Src and β-actin were
  examined by Western blotting. (E) Stabilizing effects of Src protein through interaction
  with Pp-EE were confirmed by CETSA. Western blotting was performed on the cell lysate,
  and the calculation of band intensity of Src was carried out through Image J. −:
  no treatment and +: treatment.'
