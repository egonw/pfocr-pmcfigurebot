caption: Cordycepin and radiation induced cell apoptosis in MA-10 cells. MA-10 cells
  were treated without or with 25 or 50 μM cordycepin and/or 4 Gy radiation for 24,
  48 and 72 hr, respectively, and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI).
  The original density plots of Flow Cytometry analysis were showed (A). Data were
  analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Different superscripts
  above each column indicated significant difference among each treatment (P<0.05)
  (B). Apoptosis related protein were detected by western blotting and normalized
  with β-actin (43 kDa) in each lane (C-K). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 indicate
  significant statistical difference compared to the control group.
