caption: Modulation of VEGFR-2 and NP-1 protein expression in NSCLC cell lines. (A)
  For the analysis, 2.5 × 105 H2170-P/ER, H358-P/ER, H1975, and H3255 cells were seeded
  in Petri-dishes. Cells were allowed to adhere and grow for 24 h, then starving media
  (RPMI with 0.5% BSA) was added for 24 h. Cells were then treated with Erlotinib
  (10 µM Erlotinib) for 24 h and/or with ligands (15 ng/mL EGF for 2.5 min in starving
  media) before collection of cell lysates. Immunoblotting was then performed. (B)
  The data were normalized with beta-actin, and the graphical representation is relative
  to protein expression of the corresponding parental or single-mutant cell line.
  The modulations were calculated by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software.
  Statistical analysis was performed and it was demonstrated that the results were
  statistically significant (p < 0.05) by way of a two-tailed t-test analysis.
