caption: 'EPs attenuated OD-induced metabolic disruption. (A) WGCNA cluster dendrogram
  groups metabolite into distinct metabolite modules (with different colors) defined
  by dendrogram branch cutting. The functional enrichment analysis of different modules
  was performed by MetaboAnalyst. (B) Association of metabolite WGCNA modules with
  group information. (C) Network diagrams of differential metabolites in two metabolic
  modules (M2, M3) that are significantly correlated to OD. Circle colors indicate
  the different class I metabolites category in each module; circle size indicates
  the abundance of the metabolites. Metabolites were mainly classified into three
  classes: amino acid and its metabolomics, organic acid and its derivatives, and
  glycerophospholipids. (D) These serum metabolites were mapped into the tryptophan
  metabolic pathway. The majority of metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were upregulated
  in OD group relative to Chow group (D1-2, D5). Meanwhile, serotonin (D3) and indole
  pathways (D7-8) were depleted in the OD group. (E) Pairwise comparisons of OD-altered
  genera are shown, with a color gradient denoting Pearson''s correlation coefficients.
  OD-associated metabolite modules (M2, M3) were related to each genus by Mantel tests.
  Edge width corresponds to the Mantel''s r statistic for the corresponding distance
  correlations, and edge color denotes the statistical significance based on 999 permutations.
  n = 6 individuals/group. Statistical significance compared to OD by one-way ANOVA,
  adjusted for multiple comparisons by Dunnett post-hoc. Lines in boxes represent
  median, top and bottom of boxes represent first and third quartiles, and whiskers
  represent 1.5 interquartile range.'
