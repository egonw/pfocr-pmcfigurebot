figure_title: Data suggest multiple potentially active epithelial–mesenchymal transition-associated
  pathways in CF, with YAP1 mediating their crosstalk
caption: Several pathways and proteins of interested identified by our study are shown
  as well as literature-based evidence crosstalk between them. Lines indicate evidence
  of a relationship between a protein and a pathway and dashed lines indicate crosstalk
  between signaling pathways.
