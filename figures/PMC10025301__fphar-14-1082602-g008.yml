caption: Heat mapping of altered proteins by TBN treatment in AD mice. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering of 210 changed proteins in the hippocampus between 3×Tg-AD group and
  TBN group. (B) 32 significantly altered proteins in the hippocampus related to mitochondrial,
  calcium ion binding, cytoskeleton and RNA processing between 3×Tg-AD group and TBN
  group. (C) Hierarchical clustering of 401 changed proteins in the cerebral cortex
  between 3×Tg-AD group and TBN group. (D,E) 74 significantly altered proteins in
  the cerebral cortex related to cytoskeleton, MAPK signaling pathway, mitochondrion
  function, axon guidance and DNA binding were identified between 3×Tg-AD group and
  TBN group. Color of each cell stand for degree of protein expression, red cell indicated
  rising level and green cell indicated reducing level compared with WT group. Heat
  mapping was performed by Heml 1.0.3.7-Heatmap Illustrator. Classification was performed
  by GraphPad Prism 7.0.
