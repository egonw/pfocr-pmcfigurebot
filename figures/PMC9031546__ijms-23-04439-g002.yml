caption: DEGs involved in pulvinus development and signal transduction were identified
  in elp1 mutant. (A) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes between WT and
  elp1 mutants after RNA-seq analysis. Up-regulated and down-regulated genes are presented
  in red and blue color dots, respectively. The x-axis represents the natural logarithm
  of fold change (Fc) and the y-axis represents log10 of the adjusted p-value of each
  transcript. The blue and red dots represent the downregulated and upregulated genes,
  respectively. (B) Hierarchical clustering analysis of all the differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in WT (A17) and elp1 mutant samples. (C) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis of the DEGs between WT and elp1 mutants. (D) Pathway enrichment of differentially
  expressed genes. The upregulated DEGs are enriched above blue dotted line, while
  downregulated DEGs are enriched below the blue dotted line. (E) Selected significantly
  differentially expressed genes in potassium channel, chloride ion channel, circadian
  rhythm, light signal component, cell wall organization or biogenesis and auxin signal
  component.
