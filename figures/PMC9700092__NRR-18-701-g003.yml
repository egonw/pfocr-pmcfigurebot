caption: 'Müller glial responses in retinal degeneration.(A) Müller glial regeneration
  in zebrafish. Upon injury, Müller glia undergo reprogramming and enter the cell
  cycle for proliferation, stimulated by β-catenin, Mapk/Erk, Jak/signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), PI3K/Akt. These signaling pathways further
  induce Ascl expression to generate Müller glial progenitor cells, which regenerate
  the injured retina. Growth factors and cytokines (such as FGF2, HBEGF, insulin,
  Midkine-a, TNFα) as well as Wnts positively stimulate the process. TGF-β, Notch,
  and neurotransmitter (GABA, glutamate) signaling negatively regulates the process.
  Adapted and updated from Salman et al. (2021). (B) In mammalian retina, the regeneration
  potential of Müller glia is limited. The activated Müller glial may undergo metabolic
  adaptation and remodeling to preserve neural retinal function. Interestingly, EGF
  and HBEGF stimulate while TGF-β suppresses Müller glial proliferation in mammalian
  retinas. Manipulation of β-catenin, Nfia/b/x, Hippo, and YAP pathways stimulates
  the generation of Müller glial progenitor cells, which can be further differentiated
  into photoreceptors upon the subsequent activation of Otx2, Crx, and Nrl following
  the stimulation of the Wnt pathway by targeting β-catenin. The graph was adapted/reprinted
