caption: Erythroid cell expansion Non-transduced CD34+ cells in presence (■) or absence
  (●) of Notch γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT as well as transduced CD34+ cells with shHIF1α
  (⯁) or with shHIF2α (▲) were grown in erythroid medium for 8 days at 20% (dashed
  line, (a)) and at 3% O2 (solid line (b)). Data represent the absolute number of
  cells obtained from 50 × 103 CD34+ cell at Day 0. The values are expressed as the
  mean ± SD of seven independent experiments at the logarithmic scale. Asterisks indicate
  a significant difference with respect to NT condition, at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01
  (**), p < 0.001 (***), Mann–Whitney test. NT, non-transduced CD34+ cells; D, day
  of culture.
