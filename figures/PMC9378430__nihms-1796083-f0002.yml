figure_title: Sonoporation of antigen presenting cells targeted by ncMBs (MUSIC) induces
  activation of STING-IRF signaling in vitro
caption: a,b, BMDMs from C57BL/6J mice were treated with MUSIC, cGAMP, or cMBs (+US),
  respectively. After treatment, the cells were cultured for indicated periods, followed
  by western blotting of proteins in the STING-IRF-3 pathway. c, Confocal fluorescence
  microscopy images of the BMDMs nuclear translocation of activated IRF-3 (phosphorylated
  IRF-3 or pIRF-3) at 6 h after treatment. d,e, Western blotting of NF-κB pathway
  signaling were performed using same samples from the cells treated as above. The
  red box in (a,b,d,e) refers specifically to MUSIC treatment. f, Confocal fluorescence
  microscopy images of the BMDM nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB (p65). c,f,
  Scale bar=20 μm. Right panels indicate quantification of nuclear fluorescent positive
  cells done by randomly measuring 500 cells in each group. g, ifna1 and ifnb1 mRNA
  expression levels in mouse BMDMs treated as above were determined via real-time
  PCR. h, IFN-α and IFN-β cytokine released in cell culture supernatants from above
  were measured by ELISA. g,h, n=4 repeats in each group. i,j, CD8+ T cells from OT-I
  mice and CD4+ T cells from OT-II mice were stained with Far-red. T cell proliferation
  was measured by flow cytometry after co-culture with MUSIC-activated BMDMs with
  pulsed OVA peptides for 72 h, respectively. Right panels indicate the quantification
  of proliferated cells as gated. i, n=6; j, n=3. All data are representative from
  at least three biologically independent experiments. c,f-j, data are presented as
  mean ± s.d.; statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test.
