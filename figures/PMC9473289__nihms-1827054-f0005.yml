caption: A) Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) images showing staining (representative
  images of n=5) of S1P receptors 1 and 3 in the microvascular endothelium from patients
  with CAD. The endothelium is highlighted by the red box. B) S1P induced a dose-dependent
  dilation (10−12 to 10−7) was not significantly reduced in the presence of the S1PR1
  inhibitor W146 (10μM, n=5) in arterioles collected from patients diagnosed with
  CAD. (C) Dilation to S1P was significantly impaired during exposure to the S1PR3
  inhibitor CAY10444 (10μM, n=5) compared to S1P alone (n=5). D) In vessels from patients
  with CAD, dilation was not significantly impaired with the addition of L-NAME (100μM,
  n=5), but was significantly reduced in the presence of PEG-Catalase (500U, n=5)
  (E). Data are expressed as mean % maximal dilation±SEM., *p<0.05 compared to S1P
  treatment alone.
