caption: Genes with more sSNVs are more likely to be involved in cancer. The four
  categories of genes are identified by the above-described filters (Methods). The
  X-axis indicates that genes with more than the corresponding amount of sSNVs (represented
  as percentile) are selected. Y-axis represents the fraction of the selected category
  genes that are found in (A) CGC, (B) KEGG cancer pathway genes, and (C) DO cancer
  genes. Numbers on top of each bar in panel A show the number genes of each category.
