caption: Two Scenarios for Clinical Applications of Risk EquationsPooled Cohort Equations
  are used to predict 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year
  risk of heart failure (,). In scenario 1, 10-year risk of ASCVD is higher than 10-year
  risk of HF. Therefore, GLP-1RA stands out as the first-line therapy, followed by
  SGLT2 inhibitor. In scenario 2, 10-year risk of HF is higher than 10-yr risk of
  ASCVD. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitor is the first-line therapy, followed by GLP-1RA.
  BMI = body mass index (kg/m2); HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HF = heart
  failure; HT = hypertension; SBP = systolic blood pressure; T2D = type 2 diabetes;
  other abbreviations as in , , and .
