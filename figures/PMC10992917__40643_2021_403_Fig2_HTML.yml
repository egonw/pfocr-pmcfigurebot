caption: Combinatorial approaches attempted in single strain for BB biosynthesis.
  Black color denotes the native pathways responsible for butyryl-CoA and/or butanol
  accumulation through intracellular acyl-CoA molecules (in Clostridia species). The
  grey color shows the pathway optimizations by either overexpressing downstream acyl-CoA
  enzymes or introducing new enzymes with higher activity. Green color indicates the
  heterologous pathways aiming at improving the intracellular butyryl-CoA molecule
  for high butyrate and butanol availability (often in E. coli). In some cases, butyryl-CoA
  and/or butanol are supplemented in the fermentation system. The blue circles indicate
  BB produced. AAT modules should be introduced to catalyze the esterification reaction
  of butyryl-CoA with butanol into biosynthetic BB. adhE2 (aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase)
