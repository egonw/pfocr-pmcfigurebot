caption: Gulati et al. introduced a facile protocol for the synthesis of benzimidazoles
  mediated by fruit juices including Cocos nucifera L. juice, Citrus limetta juice
  and Citrus sinensis L. juice, by the condensation of substituted aldehydes and o-phenylenediamine.
  Eight compounds were furnished under solvent-free conditions at room temperature.
  All synthesized compounds were evaluated for herbicidal activity against Raphanus
  sativus L. (radish) seeds, antifungal activity against R. Solani and C. gloeosporioides,
  and antibacterial activity against Erwinia cartovora and Xanthomonas citri. The
  bioassay results indicated that strong electron-withdrawing groups at the phenyl
  ring showed a better activity profile than electron-donating groups. A reaction
  pathway involving ascorbic acid catalysis was also suggested ().
