caption: Testing and validating DIO3OS as a biomarker for the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.
  A DIO3OS expression in osteosarcoma and various subtypes of sarcoma (FN, LN, MN,
  NST, NOS, and SN) in test cohort. B–G The area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the
  TARGET and TCGA sets assesses the differential diagnostic performance of DIO3OS
  between osteosarcoma and other subtypes of sarcoma. H DIO3OS expression in osteosarcoma
  and various subtypes of sarcoma (LN, MN, NST, and SN) in validate cohort. I–L The
  area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the validate cohort assesses the differential
  diagnostic performance of DIO3OS between osteosarcoma and other subtypes of sarcoma.
  M In validate cohort, the expression level of DIO3OS between metastasis and non-metastasis
  groups. N The effect of metastasis on the prognosis of osteosarcoma overall survival
  (OS) is statistically significant in validate cohort. O The effect of high DIO3OS
  expression on the prognosis of osteosarcoma overall survival (OS) is statistically
  significant in validate cohort. P Time-dependent ROC curves, 1-Year (AUC = 0.747),
  3-Year (AUC = 0.872), 5-Year (AUC = 0.960) in validate cohort. P-value of less than
  0.05 is considered statistically significant (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001)
