caption: 'PRC2 epigenetically regulated Nodal/ALK7 signalling in trophoblast in hypoxia.
  (A) ChIP analysis was performed in cultured HTR8/SVneo cells with or without hypoxia
  treatment. Real‐time PCR was used for the detection of ChIP signals at the promoter
  of Nodal gene. Values denote the mean ± SD; *p < 0.01 versus IgG; #p < 0.01 versus
  NC. (B, C) Western blot analysis showed the impacts of gene interference with EZH2
  or EED using either shRNAs or expressing vectors on protein expression of EZH2,
  EED, Nodal and ALK7 under hypoxic conditions. Values denote the mean ± SD; *p < 0.05
  versus Hypoxia+ Scramble shRNA, # p < 0.05 versus Hypoxia+ Control expressing vector.
  (D) Western blot demonstrated the effects of gene knockdown of Nodal or ALK7 by
  shRNAs on protein expression of EZH2, EED and Nodal/ALK7 signalling pathway under
  hypoxia conditions. Values denote the mean ± SD; *#p < 0.01 versus Hypoxia+ Scramble
  shRNA. (E) ChIP‐qPCR analysis showed differential ChIP signals at the promoter of
  Nodal gene in trophoblasts in hypoxia after EZH2 gene knockdown or overexpression.
  Values denote the mean ± SD; *p < 0.01 versus IgG, ap <0.05 versus Hypoxia+ Control
  vector, bp <0.01 versus Hypoxia+ Control vector'
