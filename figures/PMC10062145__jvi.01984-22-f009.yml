caption: 9-butyl-harmol induces the degradation of the NDV L protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. (A) 9-butyl-harmol induces the degradation of the NDV L protein. DF-1 cells
  were transfected with pCAGGS-myc-L. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were treated
  with (lower left panel) or without (upper left panel) cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) for
  30 min, after which the cells were incubated with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM).
  At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested to assess the expression
  level of the L protein via Western blotting. The relative quantification of the
  target protein level was analyzed via ImageJ (right panel). Mean values ± SDs are
  shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests.
  ns, not significant, *, P < 0.05. (B) NDV L protein degradation does not rely on
  autophagy. DF-1 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-myc-L. At 48 h posttransfection,
  the cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) for 30 min, after which the
  cells were incubated with 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM) together with wortmannin (500 nM).
  At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested to assess the expression
  level of the L protein via Western blotting (left panel). The relative quantification
  of the target protein level was analyzed by ImageJ (right panel). Mean values ±
  SDs are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t tests. ns, not significant. (C) The NDV L protein is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. DF-1 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-myc-L. At 48 h posttransfection,
  the cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) for 30 min, after which the
  cells were incubated with 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM) together with MG-132 (200 nM). At
  the indicated time points, the cells were harvested to assess the expression level
  of the L protein (left). The relative quantification of the target protein level
  was analyzed via ImageJ via Western blotting (right panel). Mean values ± SDs are
  shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests.
