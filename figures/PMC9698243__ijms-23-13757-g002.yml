caption: Ionizing radiation (IR) potentiates the IL-1β production of RAW264.7 macrophages
  and primary cultured peritoneal macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
  RAW264.7 (2 × 105 cells/mL) cells were irradiated (5 Gy) using a blood gamma irradiator.
  After 24 h, the cells were treated with LPS (0.1 μg/mL). After another 24 h, the
  supernatant was used for IL-1β (A) or nitrite (NO2−) (C) determination. (B) Measurement
  of the mRNA level of IL-1β in the different treatment groups. (D,E) Representative
  confocal microscopy image for intracellular IL-1β detection of LPS only- and IR
  + LPS-treated macrophages and fluorescence analysis data. (F) Primary cultured peritoneal
  macrophage (5 × 105 cells/mL) cells were irradiated (5 Gy) using a blood gamma irradiator.
  After 24 h, the cells were treated with LPS (0.1 μg/mL). After another 24 h, the
  supernatant was used for IL-1β.
