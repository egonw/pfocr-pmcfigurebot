caption: CsMYB1 was involved in galloylated cis‐catechins (EGCG and ECG) biosynthesis
  processes in tea leaves. (a) Biosynthesis pathway for galloylated cis‐catechins
  in tea plants. Phenylpropanoid metabolic fluxes mainly flow into cis‐catechins (EGCG
  and ECG) biosynthesis, and fewer flow into trans‐catechins (C and GC) biosynthesis.
  Some key biosynthetic enzymes are highlighted with the blue colour and black solid
  arrows. Other related enzymes are represented with a dashed arrow. ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; C, catechin; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4‐reductase;
  ECG, epicatechin gallate; EGCG, epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate; GC, gallocatechin; LAR,
  leucoanthocyanidin reductase; SCPL1A, type 1A serine carboxypeptidase‐like acyltransferases;
  β‐G, β‐glucogallin. (b) Pearson correlation analysis of the expression of candidate
  MYB genes and the contents of galloylated cis‐catechins (EGCG, ECG), as well as
  the expression (FPKM) of galloylated cis‐catechins biosynthetic genes, CsANR and
  CsSCPL1A, from eight different tissues and developing leaves, including the apical
  bud, the young leaf, the mature leaf, the old leaf, flower, fruit, root and stem;
  developing leaves included the apical bud, the first leaf, the second leaf, the
  third leaf, the fourth leaf and the old leaf. The sizes of circles indicate the
  degree of correlation. Green indicates positive, and red, negative correlation.
  (c) Enhanced CsMYB1 transcription and catechins contents in the leaves of tea plant
  by abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment or insect attack. Data
  were from three biological replicates and are expressed as means ± SD. The difference
  between treatments and control is significant when *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 in
  Student’s t‐test. CsACTIN was used to normalize the expression data.
