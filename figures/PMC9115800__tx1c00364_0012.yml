caption: Impact of Alternaria toxins on the viability of HCEC-1CT cells. Viability
  was assessed by (A) metabolic activity (CTB assay), (B) protein content (SRB assay),
  and (C) LDH release after 24 h of incubation with concomitant IL-1β stimulation
  for the final 22 h. Results are presented as mean + SD normalized to stimulus control
  (1% DMSO and 25 ng/mL IL-1 β). “*” (p < 0.05) indicates significant differences
  calculated by applying the Student’s t-test test against the stimulus control. “+”
  and “MAX” indicate the positive control and Lysis control, respectively, provided
  with the CyQuant LDH Cytotoxicity Kit.
