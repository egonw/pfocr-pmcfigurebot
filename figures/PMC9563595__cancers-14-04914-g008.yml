caption: 'Involved pathways enriched in the clonal and subclonal mutations in ctDNA
  before and after treatment for (A) CR + VGPR; (B) PR + PD. PyClone was used to analyze
  the clonal population structures in baseline ctDNA and post-treatment ctDNA samples.
  The copy number information of each SNV was used as input. For each clustering process,
  a PyClone algorithm was run for 20,000 iterations with a burn-in of 2000, using
  a beta-binomial model with the “total_copy_number” option (Murtaza M, Dawson SJ,
  Pogrebniak K, Rueda OM, Provenzano E, Grant J et al. Multifocal clonal evolution
  characterized using circulating tumor DNA in a case of metastatic breast cancer.
  Nature communications. 2015; 6: 8760.) []. To clarify the functional role of clonal
  and subclonal genes, we performed pathway enrichment analysis in the mutations detected
  in before and after treatment samples.'
