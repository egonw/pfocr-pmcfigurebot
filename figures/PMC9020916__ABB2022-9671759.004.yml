caption: 'Effects of rhein on NF-κ B signaling pathway in rats with chronic glomerulonephritis.
  (a) Western blot was utilized to determine NF-κB expression in the nucleus (Nucl-NF-κB)
  or cytoplasm (Cyto-NF-κB) of rat kidney tissues in each group (n = 6). (b) Western
  blot was applied to detect IκBα or p-IκBα expression in the kidney tissues of rats
  in each group (n = 6). ∗∗p < 0.01, control group, ##p < 0.01, CGN group.'
