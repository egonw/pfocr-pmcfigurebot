caption: Identifying the maximum tolerated dose. A 3 + 3 clinical trial design was
  used (A). Changes to weight (B), temperature (C) liver enzymes (D and E), RBCs (F)
  and platelets (G) were measured over time. Each line represents an individual dog.
  The shaded area represents the normal range. Dashed lines show the VCOG‐CTCAE minimum
  reference for grade 2/3 adverse events. Dogs outside of the normal range that could
  be experiencing a toxic effect are identified; for example, D1.1 is the first dog
  given dose level 1
