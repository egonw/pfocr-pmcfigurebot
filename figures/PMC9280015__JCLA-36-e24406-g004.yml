caption: LINC00941 was high‐expressed in laryngocarcinoma and HNSC, and high expression
  of LINC00941 reduced five‐year survival rate of laryngocarcinoma. (A) LINC00941
  expression in laryngocarcinoma tumor and adjacent tissues was detected by RT‐qPCR.
  (B) Data analysis of LINC00941 expression in HNSC. The data were obtained from TCGA.
  (C) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of laryngocarcinoma patients with high or low
  LINC00941 expression. (D) LINC00941 expression in normal human laryngeal cells (HuLa‐PC)
  and laryngocarcinoma cells including SNU‐46, AMC‐HN‐8, SNU‐899, and SNU‐1076 cells.
  GAPDH served as an inner reference in RT‐qPCR. ^^^p or +++p < 0.001; ^ vs. Normal;
  + vs. HuLa‐PC. (GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase; HNSC, head and
  neck squamous cell carcinoma; RT‐qPCR, real time‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction;
  shLINC00941, short hairpin RNA vector for LINC00941; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas)
article_title: LINC00941 promoted in vitro progression and glycolysis of laryngocarcinoma
  by upregulating PKM via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
