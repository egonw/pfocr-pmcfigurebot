caption: Differentially expressed genes included in significant pathways associated
  with current versus never regular‐dose aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors. (A)
  Differentially expressed inflammatory pathway genes that are associated with current
  versus never regular‐dose aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors. Within the significant
  pathways (i.e., TNFa signaling via NFkB, interferon alpha response, and interferon‐gamma
  response), individual genes that are associated with current regular‐dose aspirin
  use with unadjusted p‐value<0.10 were included in the heatmap. (B) Differentially
  expressed extracellular matrix architecture pathway genes that are associated with
  current regular‐dose aspirin use versus never aspirin use in type II ovarian tumors.
  Within the significant pathways (i.e., extracellular matrix organization, integrin
  cell surface interactions, degradation of the extracellular matrix, collagen biosynthesis
  and modifying enzymes, collagen degradation, collagen formation, collagen chain
  trimerization, assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures, ECM
  proteoglycans, and ECM receptor interaction), individual genes that were associated
  with current regular‐dose aspirin use with unadjusted p‐value<0.10 were included
  in the heatmap.
