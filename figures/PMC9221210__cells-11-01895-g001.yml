caption: Structural domains of HIF-1α and HIF-1β and schematic diagram of HIF pathway.
  (a) HIF-1α contains a basic helix–loop–helix (HLH) system and two dimerization domains
  (PAS-A and PAS-B) that mediate DNA binding and dimerization, respectively. An oxygen-dependent
  degradation domain (ODD) is required for oxygen-dependent hydroxylation and degradation
  under normoxia conditions. The transactivation domains (N-and C-Terminal TADs) are
  both responsible for the transcriptional activity. N-TAD domain is located within
  the ODD domain and C-TAD domain at the C-terminal region of the protein. Prolyl
  hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-1α proline residues 402 and 564. (b) HIF-1β
  is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which has a bHLH domain,
  PAS-A and PAS-B domains, and only one C-terminal transactivation domain. (c) Under
  normoxic conditions, HIF-1α undergoes hydroxylation by prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHDs)
  at proline residues 402 and 564, which promotes the destabilization of the HIF-1α
  protein, which allows the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein to bind it, resulting
  in polyubiquitination, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation. (d) Under hypoxic
  conditions, PHDs are inactivated, promoting HIF-1α stabilization. HIF-1α dimerizes
  with its partner HIF-1β (ARNT), they are translocated to the nucleus, and, in combination
  with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/P300, they bind to genomic DNA at hypoxia
  response elements (HREs) to activate the transcription of target genes.
