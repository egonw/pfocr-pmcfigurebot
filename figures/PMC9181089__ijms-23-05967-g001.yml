caption: '(a) TEM of exosomes showing spheroid double-membrane-bound morphology (arrows)
  with a diameter of 40–100 nm; (b) Exosomes were also detected in cardiac tissues
  by PKH26; (c) Western blot for exosome characterization; (d) Histogram of exosome
  characterization for CD81, CD63, CD83 indicated significant differences (p ˂ 0.05)
  *, significant compared to the first passage at p ˂ 0.05; #, significant compared
  to the second passage at p ˂ 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± SEM; (e) Western blot
  for exosome localization in cardiac tissues; (f) Histogram of exosome localization
  in groups III and IV for CD29, CD44, and CD73. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Prussian
  blue staining of cardiac tissues proved the absence of blue staining in un-injected
  animals (g) and iron oxide particles stained blue in the myocardium of exosome-injected
  animals in the protective (h) and curative (i) groups.'
