caption: 'The pathway by which catechins regulate diabetes: (1) Catechins activate
  APMK and PI3K, and enhance insulin sensitivity, ultimately promoting uptake of glucose
  by the cells. (2) Catechins attenuate the inhibitory effect of NFκB on IRS-1 by
  suppressing the activity of NADPH, redox-sensitive signaling molecules IKK, JKN.
  (3) Catechins promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by increasing mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis
  and reducing mitochondria-associated enzyme-induced apoptosis of β-cells. (4) Catechins
  reduce ER stress by alleviating UPR, which leads to IRS-1-related decreased insulin
  sensitivity and β-cell apoptosis. (5) Catechins alleviate IRS-1-related insulin
  sensitivity reduction caused by inflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 and JNK. (6) Catechins
  decrease the source of blood glucose by reducing the activities of related enzymes,
  such as GK, GP, G-6-Pase, PEPCK, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase, and improve the activity
  of GS in promoting glycogen synthesis. (7) Catechins regulate diabetes by improving
  the gut barrier, balancing gut microbes, and promoting the secretion of glucose-related
  gut hormones.'
