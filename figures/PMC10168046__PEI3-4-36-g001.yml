caption: Metabolic network diagram of differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in
  the “rbohd/f_NaCl versus WT_NaCl” comparison. (a) Metabolic network diagram of DAMs
  in the “rbohd/f_NaCl versus WT_NaCl” comparison group. Solid lines indicate one‐step
  reactions; dashed lines indicate two‐ or more‐step reactions. (b) Impact of DAMs
  in the “rbohd/f_NaCl versus WT_NaCl” comparison group on different metabolic pathways.
  Matching pathways for metabolites were selected based on p‐values in a pathway enrichment
  analysis and pathway impact values were derived from pathway topology analysis.
