caption: 'Complement C3a and C5a aggravate inflammation in HRPE cells via the NF-κB
  signaling pathway. HRPE cells were treated with recombinant human complement component
  C3a (2 µg/ml) or C5a (1 µg/ml) with or without NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (10 µM), and
  the release of (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β, (C) IL-6, (D) PGE2 and (E) IL-10 was measured
  by ELISA. ***P<0.001 relative to control; ###P<0.001 relative to C3a or C5a treatment.
  PGE2, prostaglandin E2; HRPE, human retinal pigment epithelium.'
article_title: The complement C3a-C3aR and C5a-C5aR pathways promote viability and
  inflammation of human retinal pigment epithelium cells by targeting NF-κB signaling.
