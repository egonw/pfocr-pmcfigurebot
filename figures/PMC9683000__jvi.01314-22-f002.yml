caption: The irf2a−/− zebrafish and derived caudal fin cells exhibit enhanced resistance
  to SVCV infection. (A and B) The irf2a+/+ and irf2a−/− larvae (5 dpf) were infected
  by immersion challenge for 12 h. The survival rate was recorded after 44 h (A) and
  gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR at 24 h (B). (C to E) The irf2a+/+ and irf2a
  −/− caudal fin cells were infected with SVCV (MOI = 1) for 24 h. Viral titers in
  the culture media measured by plaque assay (C) and expression of svcv-n and svcv-g
  (D) and host antiviral factors, including ifnφ1, ifnφ3, pkr, mx1 and isg15 (E) (n = 4).
  (F) Analysis of principal components for the IRF2a+/+ (WT) and IRF2a−/− cells treated
  with MEM medium (MEM) or infected with SVCV (SV). (G to I) GSEA analysis of KEGG
  pathways for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (G), mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (H), and TGF-beta signaling pathway (I). (J and
  K) Volcano plot of ISGs expressed in the IRF2a+/+ and IRF2a−/− cells, including
  ifnφ1, irf3, mx, pmsb8a, and pmsb9a. Cells treated with MEM medium (J) and infected
  with SVCV (K). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 were considered significant.
