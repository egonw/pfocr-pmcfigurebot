caption: 'Inhibition of HMGB1 decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and catabolic mediators in rat cartilage of CFA induced TMJOA. A) The expression
  of ADAMTS5, MMP13, IL-1β, IL-6 and negative controls was detected by immunohistochemistry
  in the cartilage of CFA groups, CFA with anti-HMGB1 antibody treatment groups at
  day 21, or in the control cartilage; scale bar: 100 μm. B) Rate of ADAMTS5, MMP13,
  IL-1β and IL-6 positive cells in the cartilage was markedly increased in the CFA
  groups, while markedly inhibited after treatment with anti-HMGB1 antibody; data
  are shown as the means with 95% CI and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA), n=5, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.'
