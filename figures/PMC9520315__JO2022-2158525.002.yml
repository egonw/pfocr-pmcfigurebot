caption: Construction of molecular subtypes based on tryptophan metabolism genes.
  (a) Cox regression analysis showed tryptophan metabolism genes with prognostic significance.
  (b) Heat map of the correlation between tryptophan metabolism genes and prognostic
  genes. (c) CDF curve was constructed based on TCGA-LUAD. (d) CDF delta area curve
  was constructed based on TCGA-LUAD. (e) Sample clustering heat map when consensus
  k = 3. (f) Survival curves of three molecular subtypes. (g) Expression heat map
  of tryptophan metabolism genes with prognostic significance in different subtypes.
  (h) Difference in “tryptophan metabolism ssGSEA scores” among different molecular
  subtypes in TCGA-LUAD cohort. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
