caption: 'Diseasome properties: (A) A distribution of the molecular pathways homogeneity
  (PH) of individual diseases in cardiomyopathy-centric diseasome. Purple bars represent
  the actual diseasome, and the green bars show the random control calculated for
  each disease by randomly choosing the same number of genes. The PH is formulated
  as the maximum possible fraction of genes associated with the same molecular pathway
  in individual disease. (B) A lineplot of disease degree versus PH value distribution
  in the diseasome. (C) The distribution of number of common genes between two disease
  phenotype and their average PH value in the cardiomyopathy-centric diseasome. (D)
  The GO homogeneity measure of cardiomyopathy-centric diseasome genes for all GO
  categoriesâ€”cellular component (CC)(Middle), biological process (BP) (Bottom), and
  molecular function (MF) (Top). The GH for each disease term was calculated like
  the PH analysis. Red bars represent the actual diseasome histogram, and the green
  bars show the random control. (E) A lineplot of disease degree and GH value distribution
  for each GO category in the diseasome.'
