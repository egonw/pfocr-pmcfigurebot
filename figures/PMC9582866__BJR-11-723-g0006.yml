caption: Effect on dedifferentiation marker expression in depleted and overexpressed
  p67phox. a) and b) The chondrocytes were transiently transfected with various doses
  of p67phox plasmid (pcDNA-p67phox) or control (pcDNA3.1) to detect messenger RNA
  (mRNA) and protein expression of dedifferentiation marker as indicated by using
  reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blot. c) and
  d) The chondrocytes were transfected with specific shRNA of p67phox (pLKO.1-p67phox-shRNA)
  or a luciferase control (pLKO.1-shLuc) to measure mRNA and protein expression of
  dedifferentiation marker as indicated by using RT-PCR or western blot. The expression
  of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) or Î²-actin was used as an internal
  control of RT-PCR or western blot, respectively. Results are expressed as mean value;
  ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 compared to transfected with the pcDNA or shLuc
  plasmid. IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metallopeptidase; shRNA, short hairpin (sh)
  RNA; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.
