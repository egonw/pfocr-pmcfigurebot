caption: 'Whole-transcriptome profiling of patient LCLs (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His)(A)
  Venn diagram showing total number of transcripts and those differentially regulated.
  Note that the fold change (FC) > 1, p < 1 for 58,038 transcripts and FC > 2, p < 0.05
  for upregulated and downregulated transcripts.(B) Graph showing pathway enrichment
  of differentially expressed genes obtained from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data performed
  in NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His mutant LCLs and age- and sex-matched control. Note that
  two of the highest peaks are related to the genes involved in the immune response
  pathway and Wnt signaling. x axis shows the number of genes, and y axis shows cellular
  pathways. FC > 5 and p < 0.05.(C) Heatmaps of differentially expressed Wnt target
  genes observed in NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His mutant LCLs compared with control. Color
  key shows the level of upregulation or downregulation: green shows higher expression
  as compared with bright red.(D) Heatmaps of differentially expressed transcription
  regulators observed in NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His mutant LCLs compared with control.'
