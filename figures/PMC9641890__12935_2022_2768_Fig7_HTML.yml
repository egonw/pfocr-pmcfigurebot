caption: 'CHIR99021 could rescue the migration, invasion and β-catenin pathway after
  CHRNB2 overexpression. A, B In transwell migration and invasion assays, T3M4 were
  treated with DMSO as control or CHIR99021 (1 μM). Overexpressing CHRNB2 could decrease
  the migration and invasion of T3M4, CHIR99021 could obviously rescue the inhibition
  of CHRNB2. (D) After transfection, T3M4 were treated with DMSO as control or CHIR99021
  (1 μM) for 48 h. CHIR99021 could rescue the effects of CHRNB2 overexpression and
  significantly improve the expression of β-catenin and its downstream proteins including
  C-Myc, Cyclin D1, and CD44. (CHIR: CHIR99021; ***: P < 0.001)'
