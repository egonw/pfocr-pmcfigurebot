caption: Mechanism of different natural compounds targeting the TGF‐β pathway in cancer.
  The figure illustrates the effects of various bioactive phytocompounds, such as
  betulinic acid, caffeine, diosgenin, ginsenoside, podophyllotoxin and resveratrol,
  on apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation and metastasis linked to interference
  with the TGF‐β signalling
