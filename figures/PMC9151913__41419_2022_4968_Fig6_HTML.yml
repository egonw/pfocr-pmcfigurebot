figure_title: GlcCer plays a crucial role in promoting the metastasis of liver cancer
  cells
caption: A Diagram of cellular GlcCer metabolism. B, D The effect of PDMP or miglustat
  on the mechanism of inhibited migration and invasion of HepG2 cells with GBA1 knockdown,
  scale bar, 200 μm. C, E Western blotting was performed to determine the effect of
  PDMP or miglustat on GBA1 deficiency-upregulated proteins involved in the Wnt signalling
  pathway and EMT. F–I The relative number of migrated cells (F, H) and invaded cells
  (G, I) is shown.
article_title: GBA1-dependent membrane glucosylceramide reprogramming promotes liver
  cancer metastasis via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.
