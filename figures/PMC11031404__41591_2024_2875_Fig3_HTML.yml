figure_title: Correlative assessment of CAR-T persistence and patient cytokine profiles
caption: 'a, Expression of CD4, CD27, CD62L and CCR7 on Tcm- and Tn/mem-derived CAR + T
  cell products (n = 58 cell products) as determined by flow cytometry, with means
  (± standard error of the mean) indicated by black bars. ****P < 0.0001; ***P ≤ 0.0005
  using a two-sided unpaired t-test. b, Box-and-whisker plot of maximum WPRE copy
  number per microgram of PBMC DNA by arm (n = 2, 17, 10, 8 and 20, respectively,
  for arms 1–5; reference Extended Data Fig. ). The median and interquartile range
  with whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values are depicted. *P = 0.075,
  **P ≤ 0.003 and ***P ≤ 0.0003 when using a two-sided t-test. Legend indicates maximum
  infusion dose per dose schedule (×106). c, Low-dimensional representations of cytokine
  measurements colored by compartment (SER, CSF or TCF), day of any given cycle (up
  to six cycles, with CXD0 being day 0 of cycles 2–6), cycle number, delivery route
  or dose (legend indicates maximum infusion dose × 106). d, Heatmap of cytokine levels
  across cycles (C1–6), preinfusion (D0) and postinfusion (D1) in either the CSF (left),
  TCF (middle) or serum (right), with the median log10 fold change from baseline (C1D0)
  shown. e, Box-and-whisker plot of the change in IFNγ pathway score (log10(IFNγ)
  + log10(CXCL9) + log10(CXCL10)) from baseline (C1D0) to the corresponding CXD1 within
  the CSF for survival evaluable patients treated on either arm 3, 4 or 5, for the
  first three cycles (at C1, n = 6, 5 or 14, respectively; at C2, n = 6, 6 or 15,
  respectively; at C3, n = 8, 5 or 16, respectively). The median and interquartile
  range with whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values are depicted. Dose
  schedule (DS) is indicated by dot size; **P ≤ 0.0006 compared to each of the other
  arms using ANOVA. f, CSF IFNγ pathway score at C1D1 (log10(IFNγ) + log10(CXCL9)
  + log10(CXCL10)) in patients with rGBM (n = 15) evaluated relative to response.
  Left: box-and-whisker plot of CSF IFNγ pathway scores for PD versus SD or better
  following CAR-T treatment. The median and interquartile range with whiskers extending
  to the minimum and maximum values are depicted. Right: CSF IFNγ pathway scores plotted
  against time to progression in days, with the regression line for all arms depicted.
  Dose schedule (DS) indicated by dot size and P values determined by two-sided t-test.'
