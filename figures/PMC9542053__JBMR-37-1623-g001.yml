caption: EOOP due to LRP5, WNT1, PLS3, and SMS2 defects. (A) Subcellular localization
  of the proteins encoded by LRP5, WNT1, PLS3, and SGMS2. (B) Molecular pathways involved
  in EOOP. (Left) When the WNT1 ligand binds to the receptor seven‐span transmembrane
  Frizzled and the co‐receptor LRP5, Dishevelled (Dsh) is recruited and the β‐Catenin
  destruction complex (composed by axin, APC, GSK3, and CK1α) is inactivated thus
  leading to the accumulation of β‐Catenin in the cytosol. Subsequently, β‐Catenin
  translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes, including
  those responsible for osteoblast differentiation and function. Monoallelic loss‐of‐function
  variants in WNT1 and LRP5 lead to osteoporosis due to decrease activation of the
  canonical WNT signaling pathway. (Center) Plastin‐3, encoded by PLS3, is involved
  in several molecular mechanisms, including actin binding and bundling, calcium homeostasis,
  and cell endocytosis and exocytosis. (Right) The sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2),
  encoded by SGMS2, is involved in sphingomyelin synthesis primarily in the plasma
  membrane but also in the Golgi apparatus. (C) LRP5 (light blue star), WNT1 (dark
  blue star), PLS3 (yellow star), and SMS2 (pink star) are involved in bone modeling
  and remodeling. Although both WNT and LRP5 are known to regulate osteoblast differentiation
  and function, the role of the other proteins is not fully understood yet. PLS3 might
  be involved in osteocyte mechanosensing, matrix mineralization, but also osteoblast
  differentiation and osteoclastogenesis. SMS2 could also partake in matrix mineralization,
  osteoblast activity, and osteoclastogenesis.
