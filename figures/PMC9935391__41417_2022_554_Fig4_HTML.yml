figure_title: LINC02820 is mainly distributed in the nucleus and involved in TNF/NF-κB
  signaling pathways
caption: A, B Subcellular separation experiment for K180 and K410 cells. GAPDH (cytoplasmic
  control), U6 (nuclear control). C RNA-FISH was performed to determine LINC02820
  location in ESCC cells (scale bar, 10 μm). D The top 20 KEGG enrichment pathway
  analyses between K180 cells transfected with SiLINC02820 or SiNC based on RNA-seq
  (|FC|≥1.2). E The top 20 KEGG enrichment pathway analyses between K30 cells transfected
  with vector or OE-LINC02820 based on RNA-seq (|FC|≥1.2). F The top 20 KEGG enrichment
  pathway analyses between K30 cells transfected with vector or OE-LINC02820 based
  on RNA-seq (|FC|≥2.0). G Downstream genes expression of NF-κB signaling pathway.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
