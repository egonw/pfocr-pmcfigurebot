caption: Flow cytometry analysis of MG-63 cells cultivated for 72 h on T or Z and
  then stimulated with IFN-α or IFN-γ, as well as with IL-6 and IL-4. (A) Phospho-STAT1
  staining. The fluorescence intensity of MG-63 cells on Z disc (left pictures), on
  T discs (middle pictures) and without discs (right pictures). MG-63 cells stained
  with isotype-matched control antibodies (negative control)—black dotted histograms;
  unstimulated cells—grey histograms (sometimes they completely overlap with the peaks
  of isotype control). MG-63 cells stimulated with IFN-α (orange histograms) and stimulated
  with IFN-γ on Z disc (blue histogram, on T discs—green; without discs—red histogram).
  (B) Stimulation with IL-6 and analysis of phospho-STAT3. Black dotted histogram—isotype
  matched control. Unstimulated cells—grey histograms (almost overlap with isotype
  control histograms), MG-63 cells stimulated with IFN-α (orange histograms) and MG-63
  cells stimulated with IL-6 on Z disc (blue histogram), on T discs (green) and without
  discs (red histogram). (C) Stimulation with IL-4 and analysis of phospho-STAT6.
  Black dotted histogram—isotype matched control. Unstimulated cells—grey histograms
  (almost overlap with isotype control histograms), MG-63 cells stimulated with IL-4
  on Z disc (blue histogram), on T discs (green) and without discs (red histogram).
