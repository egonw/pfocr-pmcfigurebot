caption: 'Inference of observable flux configurations for E. coli chemostat culturesExperimental
  (x axis) v.s. model predicted (y axis) absolute relative fluxes, for a set of FBA
  formulations and ME. All fluxes are normalized by the experimental glucose uptake.
  The first row shows exchange fluxes reported in,,. The rest of the rows show some
  inner fluxes reported in. Each row corresponds to a different dilution rate . The
  last row includes all internal flux correlations. Different subsystems are signalized
  by the shape of the marker, meanwhile different colors denote individual reactions.
  The legend is as follows: acetate exchange (gray), CO2 exchange (blue square), glyoxylate
  cycle (pink), pyruvate kinase  (dark green), Krebs cycle (diamond shaped), glycolysis
  (circle shaped) and pentose phosphate pathway (triangle shaped).'
