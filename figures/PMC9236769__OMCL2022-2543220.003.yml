caption: DJ-1 induced FGFR1 phosphorylation and activated the Akt, ERK, and STAT signaling
  pathways in ECDHCC-1 cells. (a and b) Cells were treated with DJ-1 (15 μg/mL) for
  24 h, and then the mRNA expression of FGFR1 (a) and protein expression of phosphorylated
  FGFR1 (p-FGFR1) and total FGFR1 (b) were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting
  analysis, respectively. The inducing activity of DJ-1 was compared with that of
  EGF (20 ng/mL). (c) Co-immunoprecipitation assay for FGFR1 and DJ-1 was performed.
  (d–g) Western blotting analysis of Akt, mTOR, ERK, and STAT3 phosphorylation was
  conducted. The inducing activity of DJ-1 was compared with that of EGF (20 ng/mL).
