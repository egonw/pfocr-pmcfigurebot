caption: Survival analysis of THBS2, BAIAP2-AS1, LINC01215, and TSIX. Based on this
  analysis, mentioned RNAs have no significant correlation with the low survival rate
  of GC patients. This analysis was performed using GEPIA2 online database, and the
  statistical parameter was based on the default setting of this database.
