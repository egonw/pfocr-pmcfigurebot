caption: 'A ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-1) reverses HUA-induced foam cell formation
  by targeting NRF2-mediated autophagy dysfunction and ferroptosis. THP-1 and RAW264.7
  cells were treated with oxLDL (100 μg/ml) or coincubated with UA (15 mg/dl) with
  or without Fer-1 (2 μM) for 24 h. Western blot assay was used to detect the protein
  level of the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway and autophagy-related proteins
  (LC3B and p62). (a and c) Representative western blot images of NRF2, SLC7A11, GPX4,
  LC3B, and p62. (b and d) Quantification of NRF2, SLC7A11, GPX4, LC3B, and p62 protein
  levels. Data are means ± SD, n = 3. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1; HUA: high level of uric
  acid; oxLDL: oxidized low-density lipoprotein; UA: uric acid. ns indicates no significance.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
