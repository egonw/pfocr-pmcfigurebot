caption: Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in single cell cohorts. (A, B) The
  tumor microenvironment (TMB) in the GSE146771 datasets identified by the single
  cell sequencing markers and the calculation of uniform manifold approximation and
  projection (UMAP). The cells are displayed in the malignant-immune-stromal sequencing
  (A) or more detailed subsets of TMB (B). (C) The BUFAS distribution of each cell
  sample in the GSE146771 dataset. (D) The Kuskal-Wallis test revealed a varied distribution
  of BUFAS among 13 cell subgroups. (E) Log2 fold change (log2FC) of BUFAS in cell
  subsets.
