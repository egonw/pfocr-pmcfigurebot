figure_title: Validation of candidate genes by bioinformatics methods
caption: The mRNA expression level of the candidate genes in a TCGA and GTEx databases
  and b Oncomine database. c The protein expression level of the candidate genes in
  Protein Atlas database (GUCA2B is not provided in the database). There is lower
  protein expression of the candidate genes in colorectal tumors than that in normal
  colon and rectal tissues. d Among the five candidate genes, the expression levels
  of ADH1C, CLCA4, and MS4A12 are associated with the overall survival of CRC according
  to TCGA and GTEx databases
