caption: Genomic abnormities in different risk groups. (a) The high-risk (top left)
  and low-risk groups (bottom right) have different somatic interaction patterns.
  (b) Forest plot of the differential pathways between low- and high-risk groups.
  (c) The PROGENy pathway activity enrichment score for 11 cancer-associated signaling
  pathways (high-risk group vs. low-risk group). (d) Barplot between the low- and
  high-risk score group shows the top differential mutated genes. (e) Violin plot
  of tumor mutation burden between the two groups.
