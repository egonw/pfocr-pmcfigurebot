caption: knockdown of ANTXR1 decreased erythroid cell proliferation and promoted erythroid
  cell differentiation and apoptosis in cord blood CD34+ cells. (a) Western blot analysis
  was used to detect ANTXR1 levels after transfection of cord blood CD34+ cells with
  ANTXR1 interference vectors. (b) CCK8 assay of cord blood CD34+ cells proliferation
  at D6, D7, D8, and D9. (c) Flow cytometry detection of CD71 and CD235a expression
  in cord blood CD34+ cells during erythroid differentiation. (d) Wright-Giemsa staining
  results of cord blood CD34+ cells. (e) Flow cytometry to detect the expression of
  apoptotic cells in the differentiation of cord blood CD34+ cells. Error bars represent
  standard deviation of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
