caption: 'Interconnectivity in nutrient metabolism and mTOR signaling. Glucose-derived
  pyruvate either is converted to acetyl-coA to enter the TCA cycle or cholesterol
  biosynthesis or can be converted to OAA. Glucose-derived carbon combined with an
  amino group from glutamate can produce serine. Serine catabolism to glycine provides
  one-carbon units to the folate cycle, which ultimately contributes to nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Alternatively, serine is incorporated into phospholipids. Glycine,
  cysteine, and glutamate are required for the production of GSH. Cysteine is produced
  from intermediates of the methionine cycle and serine in the transsulfuration pathway.
  Alternatively, cysteine is produced from cystine, which is taken up via antiport
  with glutamate. Glutamate interconversion with αKG via transamination produces various
  NEAAs. OAA transamination produces aspartate, which is critical for nucleotide synthesis.
  Glutamine is also essential for nucleotide synthesis as well as NAD, arginine, polyamine,
  hexosamine, and asparagine synthesis. Glutamine antiports with EAAs to promote their
  uptake. SAM, produced in the methionine cycle, is critical for polyamine synthesis.
  Choline-derived betaine contributes methyl groups to the methionine cycle. Alternatively,
  choline is metabolized into phospholipids. Extracellular metabolic state is communicated
  to the cell via insulin/IGF1 signaling to activate mTOR. mTOR is also regulated
  by SAM, EAAs, and arginine. Major metabolic contributions of key metabolites and
  their interconversion with other relevant metabolites are depicted. Bolded text
  reflects cell signaling and metabolic cycles; regular text reflects metabolic intermediates.
