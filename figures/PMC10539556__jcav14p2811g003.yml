caption: Knockdown of PTEN significantly reversed the influence of miR-424 inhibitor
  on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of EC cells. (A) The Ki67 expression
  in cells were evaluated; (B) The cell proliferation ability was detected with CCK8
  assay; (C) The cell invasion ability was evaluated with Transwell assay; (D) The
  cell migration ability was evaluated with wound healing assay. * means p <0.05.
  The experiment was performed 3 times.
