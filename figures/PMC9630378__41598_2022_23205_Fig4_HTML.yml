caption: scRNA-seq revealed that miR-874 downregulates PMVK and upregulates p53 target
  genes in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were transfected with control (cont) miRNA or
  miR-874 for 36 h or control siRNA or siPMVK for 48 h. The viable population of MCF-7
  cells was sorted, and each of the four groups was profiled by droplet-based scRNA-seq.
  (a) scRNA-seq data (n = 46,130) across all four groups of treated MCF-7 cells are
  shown as nonlinear representations of the top 50 principal components. Cells are
  coloured according to UMAP-based clusters. (b,c) Proportions of each cluster from
  miRNA (b) or siRNA transfections (c). Clusters increased by miR-874 (b) or siPMVK
  transfection (c) are marked with red frames. (d) Cells are coloured according to
  UMAP-based clusters of cell phase, according to treatment. (e,f) Proportions of
  the cell phase within each group (e) or cluster (f). (g) Venn diagram showing 349
  common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among 9695 genes identified by bulk
  RNA-seq and 437 identified by scRNA-seq between cells transfected with cont miRNA
  and miR-874. (h) The table shows multiple pathways enriched in 349 common DEGs analysed
  by Metascape. (i) The table shows the prediction of upstream transcription factors
  among the DEGs by TRRUST analysis in Metascape. (j) Volcano plots showing DEGs between
  cont miRNA and miR-874. (k) Dot plot showing p53 target genes. (l) The table shows
  the prediction of upstream transcription factors from the DEGs between control siRNA
  and siPMVK by TRRUST analysis in Metascape. (m,n) Violin plot of the miR-874 targets
  PMVK (m) and PPP1CA (n) in each group (****p < 0.0001; Welch’s t test).
