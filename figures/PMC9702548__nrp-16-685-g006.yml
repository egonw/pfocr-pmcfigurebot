figure_title: Effect of HFPGE on MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells.
  Cells were seeded and treated with HFPGE as described in . Cell lysates were analyzed
  by Western blotting using the corresponding antibodies. (A, C, E) Images of chemiluminescent
  detection of the blots, which are representative of 3 independent experiments. The
  relative expression ratio of p-p65 to p65 (B), p-ERK to ERK (D), and p-JNK to JNK
  (F). Protein band were quantified, with the control levels set at 100. Each bar
  expresses the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Means without the same letter differ, P < 0.05
caption: HFPGE, hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon grandiflorum extract; LPS, 0.1
  μg/mL lipopolysaccharide; NF, nuclear factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
