caption: 'Linderalactone inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
  cells. (a) Wound-healing assay detects the migration ability of BXPC-3 under varying
  concentrations of LL after 24 hours. (b) Quantiﬁcation of wound-healing assay: the
  area of cell migration in 24 hours accounts for the percentage of the wound area
  in 0 hours. (c) The transwell assay detected the migration ability of cells under
  varying concentrations of LL treatment after 24 hours. (d) Quantiﬁcation of transwell
  assay: percentage of the compound treatment group in the control group. (e) The
  transwell assay with Matrigel to detect cell invasion ability under varying concentrations
  of LL treatment after 24 hours. (f) Quantiﬁcation of transwell assay: percentage
  of the compound treatment group in the control group. Scale bar = 200 μm. ∗p < 0.05;
  ∗∗p < 0.01.'
