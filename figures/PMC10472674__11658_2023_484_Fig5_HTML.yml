caption: 'UGCG interacts with B4GalT5. A, B Representative western blots performed
  with flag or HA antibody after co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of UGCG (A) or B4GalT5
  (B) from HEK293t whole-cell lysates using flag antibody or HA antibody, respectively.
  C Representative confocal images of UGCG and B4GalT5 co-localization in primary
  cardiomyocytes. D, E Representative western blots and statistical analysis histogram
  reflecting B4GalT5 expression in hearts (N = 3). F, G Immunofluorescence images
  of B4GalT5 staining in hearts from different groups (N = 5). H, I Representative
  western blots and statistical analysis histogram reflecting B4GalT5 expression in
  cardiomyocytes (N = 3). J, K Immunofluorescence images of B4GalT5 staining in cardiomyocytes
  from different groups (N = 5). *p < 0.05. B4GalT5: Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase
