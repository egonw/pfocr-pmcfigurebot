caption: 'Profiling of the mouse skeletal muscle metabolites triggered by V. vulnificus
  infection. The metabolite profiles of mouse skeletal muscles 9 h after infection.
  (A) Concentrations of arginine, creatine, and creatinine metabolites in skeletal
  muscles were extracted from CE-TOFMS data at 9 h after infection. The samples were
  divided into four groups: PBS-treated leg (PBS), V. vulnificus-injected leg (Vv),
  leg opposite the PBS-treated leg (OP), and leg opposite the V. vulnificus-injected
  leg (OV) (3/group). (B) PCA plots showing different clustering between the PBS and
  Vv groups. The red and blue dots indicate PBS- and V. vulnificus (Vv)-injected tissue.
  x axis, 63.46%; y axis, 13.43%; z axis, 9.03% (3/group). (C) Heat map analysis of
  the metabolic changes to the fold change of each metabolite using the autoscaling
  method. Red and blue indicate high and low concentrations of metabolites, respectively
  (3/group). (D) Volcano plot showing relative changes in the metabolites in the Vv
  group, with red denoting significantly changed metabolites (by more than 2-fold),
  blue indicating metabolites that changed (by more than 2-fold) but not significantly,
  and orange indicating significant differences which were less than 2-fold (3/group).
  (E) Volcano plot showing relative changes of the metabolites in the Vv group, categorized
  into six metabolic pathways (TCA cycle, carbohydrate metabolism, pentose phosphate
  pathway, amino acid metabolism, ornithine cycle, and nucleic acid metabolism) (3/group).
  P values were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. *, FDR < 0.05
  compared with the Vv group.'
