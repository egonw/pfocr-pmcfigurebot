caption: Chrysin induces apoptosis in A375SM and A375P human melanoma cancer cells.
  (A) Cells were seeded for 24 h. After treatment with the indicated concentrations
  of chrysin for 24 h, cells were harvested, stained with annexin Vâˆ’propidium iodide,
  and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptosis rates. (B) Graphs represent the percentages
  of living cells, necrotic cells, and early and late apoptotic cells.
