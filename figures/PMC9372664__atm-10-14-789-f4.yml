caption: 'Rha regulated the fibrosis of KGN cells through modulating Wisp2 level.
  KGN cells were treated by DHEA and H-Rha, along with Wisp2 or sh-Wisp2 transfection.
  (A) Levels of Wisp2 and TGF-β1 were detected by ELISA. (B,C) Expressions of CTGF,
  TGF-β1, α-SMA, Collagen I, Sirt1, Wisp2, PPARγ, p65, p-p65, IKBa, p-IKBa, p-Smad2,
  Smad2, p-Smad3 and Smad3 were confirmed by Western blot. (D) α-SMA expression detected
  by IF staining. n=3. Data are exhibited as mean ± SD. ***P<0.001 vs. control group;
  ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. DHEA group; &&&P<0.001 vs. DHEA + H-Rha group. TGF-β1,
  transforming growth factor-β1; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; IF, immunofluorescence;
  SD, standard deviation.'
