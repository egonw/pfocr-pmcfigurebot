caption: Expression of HIF-1α/miR-494/Survivin signaling pathway in human TNBC specimens.
  Survival analysis based on the expression of miR-494 of selected BC specimens (n = 125,
  P=0.031), (B) or TNBC specimens (n = 43, P = 0.048). MiR-494 expression levels were
  inversely correlated with (C) Survivin and (D) HIF-1α in TNBC specimens, and (E)
  Survivin expression levels were positively correlated with HIF-1α in TNBC specimens.
  Expression levels of miR-494 and (F) Survivin and (G) HIF-1α were inversely correlated
  among all TNBC specimens (n = 43) as indicated by two-tailed Pearson's correlation
  analysis, respectively, and (H) expression levels of HIF-1α and Survivin were positively
  correlated among all TNBC specimens (n = 43). Relative expression levels of (I)
  miR-494, (J) Survivin and (K) HIF-1α were detected in adjacent and tumor tissues
  (n = 43) via qPCR. Results are representative of three experiments.
