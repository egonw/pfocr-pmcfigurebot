caption: Molecular mechanisms by which ANTXR1 regulates γ-globin expression via the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The interaction of ANTXR1 with LRP6 may inhibit
  the activity of the β-catenin destructive complex consisting of Axin, APC, and Gsk3
  via Frizzled. β-Catenin is then free to translocate to the nucleus where it binds
  to the TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby promoting the transcription of target
  gene c-Jun, which, in turn, activates the expression of SOX6, a repressor of γ-globin
  genes, thereby inhibiting the expression of γ-globin genes.
