figure_title: Increased CD3 expression after BCG treatment in vivo and in vitro
caption: (A) Change in average β values for CD3 genes in T1D (n = 12) as compared
  to baseline at 1 to 3 years after BCG vaccination (average ± SD; *P < 0.05; **P
  < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). (B) Heatmap indicating methylation
  patterns in all CD3 genes. The left lane shows difference in β value between T1D
  (n = 12) and NDC (n = 8), and the right three lanes show the difference in β value
  for T1D (n = 12) at baseline versus at 1 to 3 years after BCG vaccination. Hypomethylation
  is shown in shades of red, whereas hypermethylation is shown in shades of blue.
  (C) CD4+ T cells were isolated from NDC (n = 9) and T1D (n = 8) and cultured with
  or without BCG for 7 days. The cells were then washed, stained for CD3, and analyzed
  by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells that are positive for CD3 is shown (average
  ± SD; *P < 0.05; two-tailed Wilcoxon test). (D) MFI CD3 flow cytometry. The MFI
  for NDC (n = 9) and T1D (n = 8) cultured with or without BCG is shown (average ±
  SD; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; two-tailed Wilcoxon test). (E) Histograms showing the
  distribution of the β values as compared to baseline for CpGs of CD3-related genes
  at year 1 (top), year 2 (middle), and year 3 (bottom). A progressive shift of β
  values toward the left indicates progressive demethylation over time. (F) A protein
  array was performed to evaluate the change in some kinase in TCR signaling pathway.
  Upper and lower images indicate the nontreated and BCG-treated CD4+ T cells, respectively.
  (G) The density of kinase in the protein array was qualified by densitometry. White
  and black bars indicate the values in the nontreated (n = 1) and BCG-treated CD4+
  T cells (n = 1), respectively.
