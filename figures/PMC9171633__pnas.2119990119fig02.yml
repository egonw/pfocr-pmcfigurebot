caption: Ras-SIN1 RBD interaction inhibits insulin-induced Ras signaling. (A) ITC
  titration results of WT or mutant SIN1 RBD with HRas-GMPPNP. (B) Coimmunoprecipitation
  of HRas G12V with WT or mutant full-length SIN1 in MEF cells. (C) Immunoblot analysis
  of MEFs for mTORC2 downstream targets. (D) Graph shows means ± SEM of densitometry
  analyses of the immunoblots in C normalized to total protein from three independent
  experiments, respectively. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; two-tailed Student’s t test.
  (E) Expression of SIN1 suppresses insulin-induced but not EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation.
  (F and G) Immunoblot analysis of MEFs following different EGF (F) or insulin (G)-stimulated
  time points for proteins known to belong to the Ras pathway. (H and I) Graph shows
  means ± SEM of densitometry analyses of the immunoblots in F and G normalized to
  total protein from three independent experiments, respectively.
