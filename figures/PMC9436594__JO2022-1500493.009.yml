caption: (a) Correlation coefficients between KEGG pathways and risk scores larger
  than 0.3 are clustered. (b) The KEGG pathway that had a risk score above 0.3 exhibited
  a distinct ssGSEA score, and this score changed as the risk level grew. The samples
  are shown along the horizontal axis, and the increasing risk scores can be observed
  moving from left to right.
