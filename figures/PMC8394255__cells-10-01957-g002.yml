caption: Müller glia regeneration-associated molecular cascades in zebrafish. A hypothetical
  pathway representing Müller glia activation in response to injury and the sequence
  of events that leads to retinal regeneration in zebrafish (black text). Müller glia
  are quiescent in absence of injury, a process regulated by TgfB/Smad pathway. Upon
  injury, Müller glia are encouraged start reprogramming and enter the cell cycle
  in a complex of events involving B-catenin, Mapk/erk and Jak/Stat3 signalling pathways,
  which stimulate proliferation. These pathways stimulate injury-dependant Ascl-1
  expression, which regulates the generation of Müller glia-l-derived progenitor cells
  (MGPCs). Those sequences of events also occur in mammalian systems. However, the
  MGPCs in zebrafish retina expand and migrate to regenerate the injured retina. This
  regeneration potential is inefficient in mammalian systems. Intervention at key
  steps in the zebrafish Müller glia reprogramming might stimulate the regeneration
  potential in mammalian Müller glia (purple arrow).
