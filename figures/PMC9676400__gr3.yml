caption: Identification of VP1 as an Inhibitor of STING or ISD-stimulated activity
  of the IFN-β promoter. (A) HD11 cells were transfected with IFN-β-Luc reporter and
  STING expression plasmid, along with a pCMV-Myc control plasmid or VP1 construct.
  (B) Cells were transfected with IFN-β-Luc reporter and the stimulator ISD, together
  with a pcDNA3.1 empty vector or VP1 construct. Cells were harvested at 24 h after
  transfection and IFN-β luciferase activity was analyzed. All data represent results
  from one of three independent experiments and are plotted as means ± standard deviations
  from three independent experiments; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
