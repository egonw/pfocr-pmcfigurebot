caption: Comparison of sterol profiles for Leishmania promastigotes of different species.
  Relative quantification of each sterol among different species was achieved by extracting
  free sterols from 108 parasites and normalizing LC-MS/MS signals by internal standard
  spiked into each sample. Bars and error bars represent the mean and standard deviation
  of triplicate determinations.
article_title: Sterol profiling of Leishmania parasites using a new HPLC-tandem mass
  spectrometry-based method and antifungal azoles as chemical probes reveals a key
  intermediate sterol that supports a branched ergosterol biosynthetic pathway.
