caption: Ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS) mapped on the Toll-like
  receptor signaling pathway from the KEGG database (; ; ). Each box represents one
  gene in the pathway and the color within the box shows dN/dS for that particular
  gene. dN/dS was estimated from a total of 26 species of waterfowl using PAML. Small
  boxes without a color indication were not included in the hybrid capture, usually
  because they were not annotated in the mallard genome at the start of the study.
