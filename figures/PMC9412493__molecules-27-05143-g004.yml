caption: 'Esculetin regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway
  that was induced by LTA in RAW cells. Cells were treated with esculetin (10 and
  20 µM) and LTA (10 µg/mL) for 1 h. Western blotting assay was performed to detect
  (A) the degradation of IκBα and (B) the phosphorylation of p65 in LTA-induced RAW
  cells. (C) Esculetin inhibited LTA-induced p65 nuclear translocation (scale bar
  = 10 μm). (D) Data were graphed by pooling multiple images, with each individual
  data point corresponding to the mean fluorescence intensity of each individual cell
  nucleus. Data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 4). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01,
  compared with the control group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01, compared with the LTA
  group.'
