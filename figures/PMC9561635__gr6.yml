caption: 'HADC4/5 repress MuERVL through H3K9me1/2(A and B) ChIP-qPCR analysis of
  HDAC4 (A) and HDAC5 (B) binding on different retrotransposons. ChIP-qPCR data were
  normalized to input and that of the control region.(C and D) HDAC4 (C) and HDAC5
  (D) binding profile around the center of MuERVL locus. The ChIP-seq signal was presented
  as normalized read counts.(E) The overlap between upregulated genes in Pim3−/− ESCs
  and HDAC4/5 binding genes.(F) Western blot analysis of H3K9ac and H3K9me1/2/3 levels
  in WT ESCs expressing Hdac4/5 shRNA or control (Ctrl) shRNA. H3 was used as a loading
  control.(G) ChIP-qPCR analysis of G9A enrichment on MuERVL after shRNA depletion
  of Hdac4/5 in ESCs. ChIP-qPCR data were normalized to input and SINE B1.(H) Western
  blot analysis of H3K9me1/2/3 and H3K9ac levels in WT and Pim3−/− ESCs. H3 was used
  as a loading control.(I–K) ChIP-qPCR analysis of H3K9ac (I), H3K9me1 (J), and H3K9me2
  (K) enrichment on MuERVL in WT ESCs and Pim3−/− ESCs. ChIP-qPCR data were normalized
  to input and SINE B1. All ChIP-qPCR data in Figure 6 are biological triplicate data
  (n = 3 independent experiments) and are presented as mean ± SEM; ∗∗p < 0.01 in Student’s
  t test.(L) Schematic of PIM3 signaling pathway repressing 2C-like totipotent state
  in embryonic stem cells. PIM3 phosphorylates LKB1 and thereby inhibits its activity
  to phosphorylate AMPK, while hypo-phosphorylated HDAC4/5 remain in the nucleus to
  repress MuERVL and associated 2C-like state by deacethylating H3K9 and allowing
  G9A to deposit H3K9me1/2; in the absence of PIM3, p-AMPK phosphorylates HDAC4/5
  and mediates their cytoplasmic localization, which promotes H3K9ac enrichment and
  H3K9me1/2 loss on MuERVL, and subsequent activation of MuERVL and 2C-like state
  from repression. The purple circle represents the nucleus. Dashed arrow: events
  that have not occurred.'
