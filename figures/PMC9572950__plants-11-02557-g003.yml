caption: The MVA volatile synthesis pathway was positively correlated with ECG and
  negatively correlated with total amino acid content. (a) HCA and heat map analysis
  of volatile synthesis pathways and major non-volatile metabolites of tea; (b) a
  proposed metabolic connectivity of amino acid catabolism with the MVA volatile synthesis
  pathway and the catechin synthesis pathway in the tea tree.
