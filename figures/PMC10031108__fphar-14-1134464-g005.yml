caption: 'Myricetin attenuated excessive oxidative stress (ROS) and reduced glial
  activation through NRF2 pathway. (A) The protein bands of T-NRF2, N-NRF2, KEAP1,
  HO-1, and NQO-1 were evaluated by Western blot in brain tissues 24 h after HI injury.
  (B) Quantitative analysis of Western blot bands (n = 4 per group). (C) The MDA level
  in brain tissues 24 h after HI brain injury (n = 5 per group). (D) The GSH-px level
  in brain tissues 24 h after HI brain injury (n = 5 per group). (E) The representative
  immunofluorescence staining images of IBA-1 (green). Nucleus were stained with DAPI
  (blue). (F) The representative immunofluorescence staining images of GFAP (red).
  The data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Scale
  bar: 100 μm.'
