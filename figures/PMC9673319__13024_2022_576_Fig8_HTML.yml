caption: SorCS3 localization and AD-related signaling. SorCS3 predominantly displays
  somatodendritic localization, especially at the plasma membrane where it binds its
  ligands. It is also found in axons but at minor extent. Box A) SorCS3 is a downstream
  effector of transcription factor Tbr1, which restricts dendritic projections to
  their synaptic targets during development (left panel). Moreover, SorCS3 transcription
  is inducible upon various external stimuli such as LTP, seizures or fear conditioning
  (right panel). Box B) SorCS3 signaling is involved in amoyloidogenic pathway. SorCS3
  overexpression (OE) reduces γ-secretase activity and APP processing resulting in
  lower production and secretion of Aβ. SorCS3 gain of function is thus neuroprotective
  against accumulation of Aβ oligomers. In contrast, SorCS3 downregulation (KD) results
  in an enhanced γ-secretase activity and thus larger formation and secretion of Aβ
  into the extracellular space. Thus, SorCS3 loss of function is neurotoxic as it
  promotes the amyloidogenic pathway. However, molecular mechanisms behind these observations
  are unknown. Box C) SorCS3 can signal upon its ligands’ binding already as a proform.
  Both SorCS3 isoforms bind proNGF and NGF, however the functional consequences remain
  unknown. SorCS3 can bind TrkB, by which it blunts BDNF-mediated TrkB activation.
  It is believed that this signaling axis is important for energy metabolism balance.
  Box D) SorCS3 signaling at the synapse is critical for memory formation and consolidation
  of excitatory neurons. SorCS3 resides at the postsynaptic side of excitatory neurons
  where it interacts with PSD95 and probably with PICK1 (the interaction was shown
  only in the HEK293 cells), which was suggested to mediate the endocytosis and sorting
  of AMPA receptors, a critical step for GluR- and NMDAR-dependent long-term depression
  (LTD), spatial learning and fear extinction memory. Notably, Sorcs3 expression is
  upregulated in engram neurons during memory formation
