caption: EMT is the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, during which
  epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and claudins are decreased, while mesenchymal
  markers such as vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, and MMPs are increased. Hypoxia-induced
  HIF-1α can regulate the expression level of lncRNA and form a mutual activation
  pathway with lncRNA, thereby promoting the production of EMT-TFs and promoting the
  process of tumor EMT.
