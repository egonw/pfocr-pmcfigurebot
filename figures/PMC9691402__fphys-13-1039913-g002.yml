caption: 'ERα increases mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis. (A) The mtDNA
  copy number in cerebral VSMCs (n = 10 per group). (B–F) The mtDNA copy number (B),
  the mRNA expression levels of Pgc1α, Pgc1β, Nrf1, Nrf2, Tfam, Plog1, Plog2, and
  Polrmt (C), representative subunits of the electron transport chain (D), the maximal
  cellular respiration (E) and mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity (F) in A7r5
  cells treated with FBS after transfected with Ad-ERα or Ad-NC (n = 3 per group).
  The A7r5 cells mentioned above were incubated with FBS for 72 h after transfected
  with adenoviruses expressing ERα or noncoding control for 48 h. *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. FBS.'
