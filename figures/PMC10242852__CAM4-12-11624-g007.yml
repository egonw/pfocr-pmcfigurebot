caption: Knockdown of MAPK4 inhibited proliferation and cell migration and induced
  cell cycle arrest of GBM cells. (A) Immunoblot was used to evaluate the expression
  of MAPK4 in five GBM cell lines and a normal astrocyte cell line (HEB). Protein
  intensity was analyzed by densitometry and the levels were normalized to GAPDH.
  (B) MAPK4 was silenced by shRNA in U87 and T98G cells. Knockdown efficiency was
  evaluated by immunoblot. Protein intensity was analyzed by densitometry and the
  levels were normalized to actin. (C) The viability of U87 and T98G cells under MAPK4
  knockdown was evaluated by CCK8 after cell seeding. (D) Cell cycle of U87 and T98G
  cells under MAPK4 knockdown was measured by Flow Cytometry. (E and G) Apoptosis
  of MAPK4 knockdown U87 and T98G was measured by Flow Cytometry. (F and H) The migration
  ability of MAPK4 knockdown U87 and T98G cells was assessed by transwell assay. Data
  represent three independent experiments. Error bars, SD. ns. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001.
