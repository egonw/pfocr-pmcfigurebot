caption: Lymphatic endothelial cells VEGF activity shapes the transcriptional landscape
  in CH. (A) The bubble plot shows KEGG enrichment analysis of all genes with significant
  differences in lymphatic endothelial cells of CH group compared with healthy controls;
  p < 0.05. (B) AUCell evaluates the cell function of lymphatic endothelial cell subsets
  in CH group and healthy control group and shows the top 50 KEGG signaling pathway
  enrichment in CH.
