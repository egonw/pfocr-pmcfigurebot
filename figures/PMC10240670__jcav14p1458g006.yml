caption: Orlistat leads to changes of metabolic ions. The metabolic ion densities
  of QGP-1 cells treated with DMSO and orlistat were measured. (B) The differential
  metabolic ions between QGP-1 cells treated with DMSO and orlistat were shown as
  volcanic plots. (C) Compared to DMSO, orlistat affected various processes related
  to lipid metabolism. (D) Orlistat affected a lot of pathways, particularly metabolic-related
  pathways.
