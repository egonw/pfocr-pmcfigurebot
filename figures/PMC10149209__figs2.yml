caption: Inhibition of purine and pyrimidine metabolism disrupts lipid droplets in
  differentiating adipocytes.A, schematic depicting pyrimidine synthesis pathway.
  Inhibitors of pyrimidine synthesis are shown in green. B, Oil Red O staining of
  primary adipocytes differentiated for 6 days and treated with vehicle or indicated
  drugs every other day. C, Oil Red O staining of 3T3-L1 cells differentiated for
  6 days and treated with vehicle or indicated drugs every other day. (D) 6MP, (E)
  MIZ, (F) BRQ, and (G) 5FU dose studies in µM range followed by western blot analysis
  of perilipin, FABP4, and tubulin. H, Western blot analysis of perilipin, FABP4,
  perilipin, and α-tubulin after 6 days of differentiation in primary adipocytes treated
  with 10 µM MPA or 10 µM AVN. I, Western blot analysis of perilipin, FABP4, DHODH,
  and tubulin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with shControl or shDHODH and differentiated
  for 8 days. 6MP, 6-mercaptopurine; MIZ, mizoribine; BRQ, brequinar; 5FU, 5-fluorouracil;
  FABP4, fatty acid binding protein 4; MPA, mycophenolic acid; AVN, AVN944; DHODH,
  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
