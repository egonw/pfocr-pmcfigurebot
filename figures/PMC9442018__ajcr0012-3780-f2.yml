caption: Identification and comparison of various glutamine metabolic patterns of
  ccRCC. A. Consensus clustering cumulative distribution function (CDF) for K = 2-9.
  B. Delta region graph showed the relative change in the area under the CDF curve
  for K = 2-9. C. Consensus clustering matrix for K = 2. D. Kaplan-Meier overall survival
  (OS) curves for 539 ccRCC patients in clusters A and B. Patients in cluster A had
  a significantly longer survival (P = 0.004). E. Based on the results of the cluster
  analysis, heatmap showed the correlation with clinicopathological characteristics.
  F. GSVA enrichment analysis showing the biological pathways associated with distinct
  glutamine metabolic modification patterns. The heatmap was used to visualize these
  biological processes; red represents activated pathways and blue represents inhibited
  pathways. G. GO functional annotation analysis of DEGs between clusters A and B,
  and enriched biological processes (BPs), cellular components (CCs), and molecular
  functions (MFs). H. KEGG pathway enrichment of DEGs between clusters A and B. The
  enriched items were analyzed by using gene counts, gene ratio, and adjusted P values.
