caption: Effects of PBE on BMM viability. (A) BMMs (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded
  in 96-well plates, treated with PBE (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL), and incubated
  at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. (B) BMMs were treated with PBE (50 µg/mL) and incubated
  for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. After incubation, cell viability was measured using the
  MTT assay. Bars labeled with different superscripts indicate significant differences
  (* p < 0.05 vs. control or vs. 0 days). The results are expressed as the mean ±
  standard deviation of at least three independent experiments (n = 3).
