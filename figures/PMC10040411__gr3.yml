caption: EOCRC-specific molecular events across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic
  levels(A) Correlations between chronological age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer
  and DNAmAge across tumors and NATs stratified by age-of-onset subgroups. Pearson’s
  correlation test was used to calculate correlation coefficients (r) and p values.(B)
  Differences in abundances of six immune cell types between EOCRC and LOCRC. p value
  was calculated via Wilcoxon rank-sum test.(C) Heatmap of TMB and TIME in four clusters
  at “hot,” “pre-hot,” “cold,” and “high TMB” immunophenotypes. K-means clustering
  by column is 4, accompanied by hierarchical clustering.(D) Differential distributions
  of four immunophenotypes in age-of-onset subgroups.(E) Pathway enrichment analysis
  for the age-related proteome. A total of 1,192 proteins were assigned to age-related
  proteins via differential expression analysis of the proteome between EOCRC and
  LOCRC tumors at p < 0.05.(F) Differential expression pattern of platinum drug resistance-related
  genes. All genes existed in both transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons between
  EOCRC and LOCRC tumors. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, calculated via t test;
  ns, not significant; FC, fold change in LOCRC versus EOCRC.
