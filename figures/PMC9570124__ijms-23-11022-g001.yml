caption: 'ADAMTS16 promotes GC cell migration and invasion in vitro. (A) Quantitation
  and western blot analysis of ADAMTS16 protein expression in five GC cell lines (MKN1,
  BGC823, HGC27, SGC7901, and AGS) and normal gastric epithelial cells (GES1). (B)
  The expression of ADAMTS16 in stably transfected cells was confirmed by quantitation
  and western blot analysis. (C–F) Transwell assays were used to assess cell migration
  and invasion in the indicated cell lines (original magnification: 200×). Scale bar,
  50 µm. (G–J) Representative images of wound healing assays at indicated times (original
  magnification: 200×). The data are shown as means ± standard deviations. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ns, not significant.'
