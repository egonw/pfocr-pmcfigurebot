figure_title: PI3K inhibition promotes cell differentiation in Dnmt3a-deleted hematopoietic
  stem cells
caption: (A and B) BM and spleen cells from mice transplanted with Dnmt3a–/– cells
  and treated with the PI3K αβ inhibitor were subjected to flow cytometry analysis
  to detect Lin–c-KIT+Sca-1+ cells. Representative dot plots showing Lin–c-KIT+Sca-1+
  cells in BM (A) and spleen (B). (C) A schematic depicting our strategy to assess
  the impact of PI3K inhibitor on the ability of Dnmt3a–/– HSPCs to give rise to colonies
  in a methylcellulose-based assay in vitro. Briefly, HSPCs were enriched from the
  BM of Dnmt3a–/– mice and platted in a methylcellulose-based media, along with the
  PI3K inhibitor and cytokines (50 ng/mL rmSCF, 10 ng/mL rmIL-3, 10 ng/mL rhIL-6,
  3 U/mL rhEPO, 10 ng/mL Flt-3, and 10 ng/mL thrombopoietin (TPO). Colonies were enumerated
  on day 7, and cells were replatted in methylcellulose media along with growth factors
  and colonies were scored again after secondary platting. (D) Equal number of cells
  (10,000 cells) were plated in methocult media and cultured for 1 week in the presence
  of PI3Kαβ inhibitor (250 nM) or vehicle. Representative colony images depicting
  reduced colony size under conditions of PI3K αβ inhibitor treatment compared with
  vehicle conditions. Experiment was performed in triplicate. Number of colonies and
  total number of cells per plate were quantified. (E) Quantitative data show average
  number of cells per colony in drug and vehicle treatment groups. n = 3, mean ± SD,
  **P = 0.005. (F) Quantitative data showing number of colonies after replatting cells
  derived from the vehicle- and drug-treated groups. n = 3, mean ± SD, ***P = 0.0005.
  (G) Flow cytometry analysis of secondary replatted colonies using an antibody against
  Mac1. Dot plots show the level of Mac1 expression in drug-treated versus vehicle-treated
  groups. Experiment was performed in triplicate. Unpaired t test (2-tailed) was performed
  in E and F.
