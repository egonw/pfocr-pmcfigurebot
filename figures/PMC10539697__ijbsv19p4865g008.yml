caption: 'TOF normalizes the activated STAT signaling in injured spinal cord and ex
  vivo microglia under inflammatory conditions. (A) Western blot analysis performed
  for p-STAT1, STAT1, p-STAT3 and STAT3 expression in spinal cord obtained on day
  7 post-injury. (B) Western blot analysis of p-STAT1, STAT1, p-STAT3 and STAT3 expression
  in primary microglia. (C) Quantification of the ratio of p-STAT1/ STAT1 and p-STAT3/
  STAT3 (The values are presented as mean Â± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way
  ANOVA; n = 3 rats per group or combined from 3 independent experiments). (D) Proposed
  mechanism: TOF regulates inflammation and promotes neural repair after SCI.'
