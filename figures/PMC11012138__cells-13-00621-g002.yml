caption: Schematic representation of the HIF protein family members and the molecular
  mechanism of oxygen sensing via the HIF signaling pathway. (A) All HIF family proteins
  contain an N-terminal DNA-binding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and two PAS
  dimerization regions. The α-subunits additionally contain an oxygen-dependent degradation
  (ODD) domain. While HIF-1α and HIF-2α have a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD),
  HIF-3α has a leucine zipper. Alternative truncated versions of these proteins can
  also be expressed. (B) α subunits of the HIF complex are subject to oxygen-dependent
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In the presence of oxygen PHD family
  enzymes hydroxylate conserved Pro residues in the ODD, which directs HIF proteins
  to polyubiquitination by VHL. HIF-1α can also be additionally inhibited by asparagine
  hydroxylation by FIH-1 under normoxia. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions PHD
  and FIH-1 are inactive, leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of
  HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins. In the nucleus they can bind the constitutively expressed
  HIF-1β subunit at the promoters of regulated genes via conserved hypoxia-responsive
  element (HRE) sequences. The complex can then recruit other transcriptional activators
  to drive the transcription of target genes.
