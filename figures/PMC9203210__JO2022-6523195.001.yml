caption: 'CHRM1 is highly expressed in PCa. (a) Immunohistochemical staining of CHRM1
  in subcutaneous tumor-forming tumors of nude mice. Scale bar: PBS: 100 μm. CHRM1:
  2 mm. (b) Immunofluorescence detection of CHRM1 in PC-3, LNCaP, and RWPE-1 cells
  in which blue fluorescence is DAPI and green fluorescence is CHRM1. (c) Western
  blotting was performed to test CHRM1 expression in the human PCa cell lines PC-3,
  LNCaP, and DU145, the normal human prostate cell line RWPE-1, and the lung cancer
  cell line A549. (d) Quantification of the rate of CHRM1/GAPDH in cells. Data represent
  the mean ± SD of three experiments. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (e) Cell crystal violet
  staining of PC-3, LNCaP, DU145, RWPE-1, and A549.'
