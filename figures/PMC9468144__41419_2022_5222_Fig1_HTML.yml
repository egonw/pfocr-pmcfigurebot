figure_title: Global transcriptional dysregulation in retinoblastoma
caption: A Scatter plot depiction of an unsupervised PCA of gene expression level
  from five RB and five retinal samples. B Volcano plot showing DEGs between RB and
  normal samples. The red and green dots represent genes with significantly increased
  or decreased expression in RB, respectively. C Heatmap of the expression profiles
  for the DEGs between RB and normal samples. Each column represents a sample and
  each line represents a DEG. D KEGG pathway analysis of the upregulated DEGs. Top
  annotation clusters are shown according to their enrichment scores [log10 (p value)].
  Background genes were all stably expressed in these samples. P value was adjusted
  by Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. E GO analysis for downregulated DEGs. F Representative
  cancer-related pathways and their corresponding upregulated genes. G Ten cancer-associated
  genes were validated by qRT-PCR using clinical samples. Each dot represents a sample.
  ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05, by two-tailed t-test.
