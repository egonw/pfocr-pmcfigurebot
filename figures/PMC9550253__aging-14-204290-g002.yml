caption: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) relieves cerebral edema and neurological
  deficits. (A) The water content of each group was measured 3 days after traumatic
  brain injury. (B, C) Three days after traumatic brain injury, neurological function
  was analyzed using the Modified Neurological Severity Scale (mNSS) and balance beam
  test. (n=6, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).
