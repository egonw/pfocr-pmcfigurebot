caption: A schematic representation of major signal transduction pathways and their
  interaction during mammary gland development. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast
  growth factor (FGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signal through receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTK) activates the central Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway or the PI3K pathway
  and the Src-STAT pathway. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signals through the
  receptor serine/threonine kinases (RS/TK) activates the central R-Smad/Co-Smad pathway
  or the PI3K and MAPK pathways or Wnt pathway. Jagged and Delta-like ligands signal
  through Notch receptors regulates the transcription factor CSL. Wnt ligands signal
  through Frizzled receptors regulates β-catenin and the transcription factors LEF-1/TCF.
  All these pathways together regulate gene expressions and that determines EMT. The
  white circles with dotted lines represent the transcription factors.
