caption: Illustration of the transportation routes of ANs post-biosynthesis, from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the vacuoles. ANs travel from their synthesis
  location to the vacuole, for storage. The first two ways, micro- (1a) and macro-autophagy
  (1b), involve ER-derived vesicles, which facilitate the transit of anthocyanins
  to the tonoplast where they attach to the membrane through soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) and release the ANs inside. The other
  transportation method is membrane transporter-mediated pathway (2) which involves
  several membrane proteins (MATE, ABC, and BTL-like transporters) that facilitate
  the transportation of ANs inside the vacuoles and their sequestration in vacuolar
  inclusions (AVIs). In this case, ANs are not transported in vesicles but are conjugated
  by GSTs (glutathione S-transferases) and form together the GSH (glutathione)â€”ANs
  conjugate, a stable and efficient form of transportation from ER to the tonoplast
  (original contribution).
