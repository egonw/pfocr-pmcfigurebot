caption: The effect of Rac1 inhibition on the GPVI signalling pathway in murine and
  human platelets. (A) Determination of protein phosphorylation on Rac1-deficient
  platelets. (Ai) Representative image of Western blotting of p-PLCγ2 on non-stimulated
  and CRP (5 μg/mL) stimulated platelets. (Aii) Quantification of the band intensity
  of p-PLCγ2. (B) Decrease in human platelets phosphorylation levels induced by EHT1864.
  (Bi) Representative images of Western blotting of GPVI signalling phosphorylation,
  including PLCγ2, Syk, and LAT in non-treated or GM6001 (250 μM, broad matrix metalloproteinase
  inhibitor) treated human platelets, unstimulated or stimulated with CRP (5 μg/mL)
  and pre-incubated with vehicle (PBS) or EHT1864 (30 or 50 μM) for 10 min at 37 °C.
  Quantification of the band intensity of (Bii) p-PLCγ2, (Biii) p-Syk and (Biv) p-LAT
  phosphorylation level induced by EHT1864 in non-treated or GM6001 (250 μM) treated
  human platelets (n = 3). Mean ± SD * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and **** p < 0.0001 by
  two-way ANOVA (comparing vehicle vs. EHT1864 treated platelets).
