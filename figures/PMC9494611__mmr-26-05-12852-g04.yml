caption: ATF3 regulates Ang II-induced development of cardiac fibroblasts and the
  TGF-β signaling pathway through binding to Cyr61. (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression
  levels of Cyr61 were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western
  blotting respectively. (C) Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8
  assay. (D) Cell migration was evaluated using a wound healing assay (magnification,
  ×100). (E) Protein expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 were semi-quantified using
  western blotting. (F) Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the protein
  expression levels of α-SMA (magnification, ×200). Protein expression levels of (G)
  CTGF, fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III, and (H) TGF-β, p-Smad2, p-Smad3,
  Smad2 and Smad3 were semi-quantified using western blotting. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. ATF3, activating transcription
  factor 3; Ang II, angiotensin II; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; Cyr61, cysteine-rich
  angiogenic protein 61; p, phosphorylated; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor;
  Oe, overexpression; NC, negative control; si, small interfering RNA.
