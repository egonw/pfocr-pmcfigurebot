caption: MORC2 protein levels are decreased following treatment of cells with PTX
  and VCR. (A, B) KEGG (A) and GSEA (B) analyses using TCGA breast cancer database.
  (C) Immunofluorescent staining was performed to detect alternations in subcellular
  localization of MORC2. HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were stained with an anti‐MORC2 (red)
  or an α‐tubulin (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) was used to stain DNA. (D) HeLa and
  MCF‐7 cells were synchronized at the indicated stages of the cell cycle through
  the double‐thymidine block and thymidine‐nocodazole arrest. Flow cytometric analysis
  was performed to determine cell‐cycle distribution. (E) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were
  synchronized at the indicated stages of the cell cycle through the double‐thymidine
  block and thymidine‐nocodazole arrest. Immunoblotting analysis was performed to
  detect MORC2 protein levels. (F, G) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated with the indicated
  doses of PTX (F) or VCR (G) for 24 h.Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine
  cell‐cycle distribution. (H, I) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated with 100 nM PTX
  (H) or VCR (I) for the indicated times. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to
  determine cell‐cycle distribution. (J, K) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated with
  the indicated doses of PTX (J) or VCR (K) for 24 h. Immunoblotting analysis was
  performed to detect MORC2 protein levels. (L, M) HeLa and MCF‐7 cells were treated
  with 100 nM PTX (L) or VCR (M) for the indicated times. Immunoblotting analysis
  was performed to detect MORC2 protein levels.
