caption: MALAT1 regulates BRF2 expression by sponging hsa-miR-1-3p. (a) ENCORI, MIRCODE
  and TARGETSCAN were used to predict the common miRNA targets of MALAT1 and BRF2.
  (b, c) Expression levels of miRNAs after MALAT1 knockdown in HCC cell lines were
  detected by qRT-PCR. (d) The binding sequence of miR-1-3p on MALAT1 and BRF2 was
  predicted from ENCORI and TARGETSCAN. (e) The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-1-3p
  (BRF2 and miR-1-3p) was assessed by luciferase reporter assay. (f) miR-1-3p expression
  in 41 pairs of HCC tissues and normal tissues was examined by qRT-PCR. (g, h) The
  correlation between MALAT1 and miR-1-3p (miR-1-3p and BRF2) expression was analyzed
  by qRT-PCR in 41 tissue pairs. (i) The relative expression of BRF2 was measured
  by qRT-PCR and Western blot after the addition of miR-1-3p mimics. BRF2 expression
  was down-regulated by miR-1-3p. (j) The relative expression of BRF2 was measured
  by qRT-PCR and Western blot after the addition of ASO-MALAT1 and miR-1-3p inhibitor.
