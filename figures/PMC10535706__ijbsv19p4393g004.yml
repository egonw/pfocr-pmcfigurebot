caption: 'AhR deficiency inhibits CRC development in the multiple intestinal neoplasia
  (Min) mouse model. (A) Breeding strategy to generate ApcMin/+ AhR -/- and ApcMin/+
  mice. (B) Western blotting for AhR protein with IEC lysates isolated from ApcMin/+
  AhR -/- and ApcMin/+ mice. (C-F) Microscopic effects of AhR deficiency on CRC. (C)
  Representative H&E staining images of colon tissue. (n=8/group). Scale bar: 100
  μM. (D) Tumor size distribution in ApcMin/+ AhR -/- and ApcMin/+ mice. (E) Tumor
  size distribution in the intestine listed and compared with ApcMin/+ mice. (F) Numbers
  of tumors in the small intestine and colon from different groups. (G-I) Immunohistochemical
  staining with an antibody against PCNA, Ki67, BrdU and TUNEL in ApcMin/+ AhR -/-
  and ApcMin/+ mice. Scale bar: 100 μM. (J) Representative pictures of tumor organoids
  originating from small IECs in ApcMin/+ AhR -/- and ApcMin/+mice. After isolation,
  organoids were kept in ENR medium (containing EGF, Noggin and RSPO1). At 7 days
  after isolation, the organoids were passaged and EN medium (containing EGF and Noggin)
  was used for organoids culture. Pictures were taken at 7 days after passaging in
  case of passage 1 and passage 3. Scale bar: 100 μM. Data of eight mice per experimental
  group are expressed as means ± SD, with Welch''s correction through one-tailed t-test.
