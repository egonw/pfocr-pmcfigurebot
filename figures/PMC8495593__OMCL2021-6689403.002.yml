caption: The key targets of UVR in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-S6K1 pathway. UVB exposure can
  cause various alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-S6K1 pathway where any functional
  loss of PTEN or RPTP-κ or hyperactivity of EGFR, Src, or AKT would eventually lead
  to constitutive cell survival, protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation,
  which are the hallmarks of skin carcinogenesis. “Created with http://BioRender.com/.”
