caption: Chemical compounds targeting translation in GB. (A) Drugs targeting the eIF4E/eIF4G
  complex ( Left ) and the MAPK/ERK/p38/Mnk1 pathway ( Right ). (B) Drugs targeting
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (C) Silvestrol inhibits the eIF4A (4A) activity. (D)
  Compounds blocking the interaction between the hnRNP A1 protein with the Cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc IRES, thereby inhibiting IRES-dependent mRNA translation. (E) Quinupristin
  and Dalfopristin (Q/D) act synergistically to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis.
  These drugs bind to the mitoribosomal large subunit (green). MOM, mitochondrial
  outer membrane; IMS, Inter membrane space; MIM, Mitochondrial inner membrane; MM,
  mitochondrial matrix. Solid lines indicate a direct effect of the inhibitors on
  the translation machinery. Dashed lines indicate that the effect is not direct on
  the translation apparatus, but rather to the signaling cascades.
