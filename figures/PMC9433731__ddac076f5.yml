caption: Inflammation in glia, regulated by IMD/Rel signalling contributes to the
  progression of the disease. (A) Expression of Rel target genes attacinD, diptericin,
  drosocin, cecropinA1 and Toll pathway target metchnikowin in day 5 and day 15 adult
  heads of wild-type (+/+), ∆VAP; Repo>+; gVAPP58S and ∆VAP; Repo>casparWT; gVAPP58S
  lines. Values on the Y-axis depict the fold-change normalized to the housekeeping
  gene rp49. Values shown are mean ± SEM. N = 3, n = 3. Statistical analysis by two-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  (B) Lifespan plots for OE of RELWT (2, red curve), RelRNAi (3, light green), RELE20
  (4, black) in the ∆VAP; Repo-Gal4; gVAPP58S genetic background. ∆VAP; Repo>+; gVAPP58S/+
  (1, blue curve) was used as the control. Curve comparison was done using the log-rank
  test. Combined P-value for the whole set is <0.001. (C) Tabulated results (ΔML)
  for lifespan recordings for experiments displayed in (B) and . Levels of statistical
  confidence are colour coded. ML for control, ∆VAP; Repo>+; gVAPP58S/+, is 26 days.
  (D) Tabulated results (ΔML) for lifespan recordings for controls as shown in . Levels
  of statistical confidence are colour coded.
