figure_title: TREM2+ TAMs display purine metabolic activity and are immunosuppressive
caption: (A) Western blotting of APRT and PNP in F4/80+ cells sorted from liver with
  and without tumor.(B and C) Metabolic activity of PNP. PNP was detected in TREM2+
  TAMs and hepatic F4/80+ macrophages from normal liver. Student’s t test was used
  to calculate the significance between two groups.(D and E) Levels of key purine
  pathway metabolites. AMP (D) and adenosine (E) were measured in TREM2+ TAMs and
  hepatic F4/80+ macrophages from normal liver. Student’s t test was used to calculate
  the significance between two groups.(F–H) Flow cytometry quantification of TREM2+
  hepatic macrophages in liver with and without tumor. Percentage of TREM2+ hepatic
  macrophages in CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages (G) and cell number of TREM2+ hepatic macrophages
  (H) are shown. Student’s t test was used to calculate the significance between two
  groups.(I and J) Flow cytometry analysis of MHC-II (I-A/I-E) (I) and MHC-I (H-2Db)
  (J) expression in TREM2+ TAMs and macrophages from liver without tumor. Student
  t-test was used to calculate the significance between two groups.(K and L) Flow
  cytometry analysis of OT-I cell proliferation in the presence or absence of TREM2+
  and TREM2− cells purified from liver with tumor. Representative histogram (K) and
  the percentage of OT-I cells at the third generation (L) are shown. The ratio of
  TREM2+ or TREM2− cells to OT-I cells is 4:1.
