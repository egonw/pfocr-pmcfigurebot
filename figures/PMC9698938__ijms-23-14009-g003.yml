caption: Hepatocyte-specific DAX1 deletion upregulates inflammatory cytokine expression
  following ConA administration. WT and Dax1 LKO mice were treated with a single administration
  of ConA (15 mg/kg, i.v.) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The liver samples were
  harvested at 6 h (PBS; n = 3, ConA; n = 6) post treatment. (a–c) Expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (Tnf-α, Il-6, and Il-1β) and (d,e) anti-inflammatory cytokines (Il1rn
  and Il-10) determined using RT-qPCR (three technical replicates for each pooled
  sample from mice). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Tukey–Kramer test after
  the one-way ANOVA was used to compare the ConA-treated LKO and ConA-treated WT groups;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
