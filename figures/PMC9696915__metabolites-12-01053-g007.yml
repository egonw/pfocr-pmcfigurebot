caption: Effects of CUG and NCUG growth patterns on the antioxidant status of the
  liver. (A–E) Relative activities of T-AOC, GSH- PX, T-SOD, and relative concentrations
  of GSH and MDA in liver tissues. (F) mRNA expression of liver Nrf2 pathway. All
  data with error bars are mean ± SEM. In histograms, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.0). CUG
  = catch-up growth; NCUG = non-catch-up growth; WW = weaning weight.
article_title: Altered Liver Metabolism, Mitochondrial Function, Oxidative Status,
  and Inflammatory Response in Intrauterine Growth Restriction Piglets with Different
  Growth Patterns before Weaning.
