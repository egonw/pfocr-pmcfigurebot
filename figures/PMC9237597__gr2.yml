caption: 'Mechanism and factors of the follicular penetration process. Ⅰ. Illustration
  for the penetration route of transdermal drug delivery system. Penetration pathways
  of transdermal drug: (1) Trans-epidermal penetration pathway around the corneocytes;
  (2) Trans-epidermal penetration pathway across the corneocytes; (3) Follicular penetration
  pathway. Particles tend to penetrate and preferentially deposit in the orifices
  of hair follicles. Ⅱ. The size effects of PLGA nanoparticles on penetration depths
  associated with the target sites in terminal hair follicles (THF) and vellus hair
  follicles (VHF).  Ⅲ. x–y images showing the nanoparticle accumulation in hair follicles
  after applying nanoparticles (20 nm, 200 nm) for (a, d) 30 min, (b, e) 1 h, and
  (c, f) 2 h. The circles in white represent hair follicles.'
