caption: Silencing of MIR205HG inhibits proliferation of melanoma via the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A-C) RT-qPCR to detect the expression levels of
  HLA-DQB1-AS1, MIR205HG-1 and TRBV11-2 in melanoma or paired tissues from 20 patients
  (Paired Student's t-test; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (D) RT-qPCR to detect the relative
  silencing levels of lncMIR205HG (Data are presented as the mean ± SD; n=3; one-way
  ANOVA and Dunnett's test; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (E) Flow cytometric analysis of
  the cell cycle distribution in A375 cells after transfection with NC or MIR205HG
  siRNA. The percentages of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M phase are shown in the bar
  graph (n=3; unpaired Student's t-test; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01). (F) Proliferation
  of A375 cells transfected with NC or si-MIR205HG-1 was assessed using a Cell Counting
  Kit-8 assay (n=3; one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test; **P<0.01). (G) β-catenin, p-β-catenin,
  c-Myc, GSK3-β and p-GSK3-β levels in A375 cells transfected with siRNAs determined
  by western blotting, ratio of phosphorylated protein to total protein (p/t, phosphorylated/total)
  about GSK3-β and β-catenin were calculated (n=3; unpaired Student's t-test; *P<0.05
  and **P<0.01). MIR205HG, MIR205 host gene; NC, negative control; p-, phosphorylated;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; siRNA/si, small interfering RNA;
  ns, non-significant.
