caption: 'm6A/HNF1A-AS1/CCND1 axis cooperated with PDCD4 to regulate PI3K/AKT pathway
  and related clinical relationship in CRC. (A) Representative images showing high
  or low expression of HNF1A-AS1, METTL3, IGF2BP2, PDCD4 and CCND1 in CRC patients’
  tumor tissues. Scar bar: 50 μm. (B) Percentages of specimens showing different levels
  of METTL3, IGF2BP2, PDCD4 and CCND1 in the high or low HNF1A-AS1 expression groups
  (n = 52, Chi-square test). (C,D) Correlation analysis between HNF1A-AS1, METTL3,
  CCND1, PDCD4 and IGF2BP2 in our CRC tissues. (E) Kaplan–Meier analysis of the patient
  overall survival based on IGF2BP2 levels in our colorectal cancer patients (log-rank
  test). (F) Kaplan–Meier analysis of the overall survival curves for CRC patients
  with high expression of CCND1 or low expression of CCND1 (log-rank test). (G) The
  regulatory mechanism of HNF1A-AS1 in promoting CRC proliferation and migration.
  METTL3-induced m6A modification contributed to HNF1A-AS1 upregulation in IGF2BP2-depentent
  way to promote CCND1 mRNA stability. Meanwhile, HNF1A-AS1 sponged miR-93-5p to promote
  CCND1 expression and suppressed PDCD4 to upregulate CCND1 by activating PI3K/AKT
  pathway. * p < 0.05.'
