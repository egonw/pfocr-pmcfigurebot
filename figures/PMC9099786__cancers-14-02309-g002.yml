caption: TRIM8 is an oncogenic protein, with its interaction with NF-kB and STAT3
  leading to cell proliferation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα e IL-1β) promote
  NF-kB activation through TRIM8. In fact, TRIM8 promotes TAK1 Lys63- linked polyubiquitination,
  leading to IKK kinase activation. Moreover, in the nucleus, TRIM8 promotes the translocation
  of PIAS3 in the cytoplasm, where it is then degraded. PIAS3 in the nucleus interacts
  with NF-kB preventing its activation. Furthermore, TRIM8 induces the activation
  of the JAK-STAT pathway promoted by IFN-γ through the degradation of two STAT protein
  inhibitors, PIAS3 and SOCS-1.
