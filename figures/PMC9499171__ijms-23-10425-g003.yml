caption: 'scSEQ data analysis of Serpina1 gene expression. (a): Global expression
  of Serpina1 isoforms: Serpina1 was broadly expressed in the wild-type mice, with
  two among thirteen clusters that showed a lower expression. (b): Correlation matrix
  of Serpina1: Top 100 genes with Serpina1 highly correlated are shown in this plot
  with highly correlated genes in green and anti-correlated genes in red. (c): Pathway
  enrichment of correlated genes. (d): Expression changes in the KO dataset of the
  correlated genes (n = 100). The ten most highly significant DEGs are annotated.'
