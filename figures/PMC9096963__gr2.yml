caption: 'Altered actin cytoskeleton dynamics upon chronic cholesterol depletion is
  due to regulation within the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. A: CHO-K1 cells were
  treated with 10 μM lovastatin alone or in combination with increasing concentrations
  of mevalonate (10 μM - 10 mM) and subsequently F-actin was quantified as described
  in . Restoring the mevalonate pathway by treatment of lovastatin in the presence
  of mevalonate inhibited actin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner. The inset
  shows key steps in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and the site of action of
  lovastatin. Data represent means ± SEM of ∼10 different fields from three independent
  experiments (∗∗∗ corresponds to a significant ([P < 0.001] difference in F-actin
  content in cells treated with lovastatin alone [or lovastatin in the presence of
  mevalonate] relative to untreated cells). B: Time course of actin polymerization
  in response to chronic cholesterol depletion. CHO-K1 cells were treated with 10 μM
  lovastatin with increasing incubation time, fixed at specified time intervals, and
  F-actin was labeled and quantified as described in . Values shown are normalized
  to F-actin levels in untreated (0 h) cells. Data represent means ± SEM of ∼10 different
  fields from three independent experiments (∗∗ and ∗∗∗ correspond to significant
  [P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively] differences in F-actin content associated
  with cholesterol-depleted cells relative to control cells). C: Membrane cholesterol
  content of CHO-K1 cells treated with 10 μM lovastatin with increasing incubation
  time. Values shown are normalized to cholesterol content in untreated (0 h) cells.
  Data represent means ± SEM of three independent experiments (∗, ∗∗, and ∗∗∗ correspond
  to significant [P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, respectively] differences in
  cholesterol content associated with cholesterol-depleted cells relative to control
  cells). See  for more details.'
