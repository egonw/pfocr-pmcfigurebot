figure_title: AXL induces purine metabolism and increases purine mutational bias
caption: (A) RNA from PC9 cells and AXL-KO cells was sequenced and differentially
  expressed genes were subjected to KEGG Pathway Enrichment analysis. (B) A waterfall
  plot depicting fold changes in metabolite abundance in AXL-KO relative to PC9-WT
  (control) cells. Metabolites were rank-ordered and specific compounds are indicated
  (assays performed in triplicates). (C) Fractional labeling of IMP in PC9-KO and
  PC9-WT (control) cells using [amide-15N]glutamine and 24 hours of incubation. (D)
  Fractional labeling of purines determined in AXL-KO and PC9-WT cells incubated for
  24 hours with [U-13C]glucose (means±SD; 3 experiments). (E) An AXL expression vector
  and MYC promoter reporter plasmid were transfected into HEK293 cells. Renilla was
  used as control. Luminescence reading was taken 48 hours later. (F) PPAT and PAICS
  promoter reporter plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells, along with AXL and
  MYC vectors. Luminescence readings (means±SD; 3 experiments) were normalized to
  a GAPDH reporter. (G) PC9 cells were treated with osimertinib (1 μM), or DMSO, for
  the indicated time intervals. RNA was isolated and subjected to real-time PCR using
  primers corresponding to the indicated transcripts. (H) PC9 cells were either untreated
  or treated for 9 days with TKIs at the indicated concentrations. Control cells were
  treated with DMSO. The indicated proteins were detected using immunoblotting. Tubulin
  served as the gel loading control. (I) Purine mutational bias was analyzed in the
  TCGA lung adenocarcinoma dataset (n=506 patients) and presented versus EGFR’s mutational
  status. (J) A cohort of 10 treatment-naïve patients, for whom both tumoral scRNAseq
  data and tumor whole exome sequencing data were available, was analyzed for AXL
  expression and purine mutational bias. Dots show individual data points and the
  diagonal represents a regression line. (K) The status of AXL expression level and
  presence of EGFR or RAS mutations in the TCGA dataset are shown. (L) A core MYC
  gene expression signature was analyzed against level of AXL expression in the cohort
  of 506 patients.
