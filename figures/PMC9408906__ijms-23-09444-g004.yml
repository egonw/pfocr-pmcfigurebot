caption: Exogenous ATP promoted protein synthesis in mouse FDB muscle, dependent on
  the P2YR-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Isolated FDB muscles were incubated without
  (−) or with (+) 3 µM ATP or UTP. A pulse of puromycin was performed during the incubation
  with the nucleotides. After that, 30 min chase with an unlabeled medium was carried
  out. Proteins from whole muscle extracts were resolved by SDS/PAGE, and neo-synthesized
  peptides were detected by immunoblot with an anti-puromycin antibody. For each figure,
  a representative immunoblot was shown at the top panel, and the quantitation of
  four independent experiments was graphed in the bottom panel (mean ± SEM). (A) ATP
  evoked protein synthesis in isolated FDB muscle, which is prevented by 30-min pre-incubation
  with 100 µM Suramin (P2Y/P2X receptor antagonist). UTP, a P2Y2-P2Y4 receptor agonist,
  also increased protein synthesis in isolated FDB muscle. (B) The increase in protein
  synthesis evoked by extracellular ATP in FDB muscle was abolished by 30-min pre-incubation
  with 50 µM LY294002 (LY, PI3-kinase inhibitor) or 100 nM Rapamycin (Rapa, mTOR inhibitor).
