caption: Graphical representation of the effects of endothelial GRâ€“Wnt interaction
  in cardiovascular and renal disease. Glucocorticoid receptors suppress Wnt signaling
  in endothelial cells. Consequently, Wnt pathways participate in the pathogenesis
  of several cardiovascular and renal disease by inducing endothelial dysfunction.
  Moreover, disruption of the FAO pathway in endothelial cells contributes to renal
  fibrosis through EndMT activation, while endothelial GR counteracts renal fibrosis
  by restoring FAO levels.
