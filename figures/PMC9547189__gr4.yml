caption: 'The regulation of trophoblast invasion by miR21 is dependent on dephosphorylation
  at LATS1Thr1079 and YAPSer127 through the suppression of PP2A Bβ, which interacts
  with LATS(A) Schematic representation of the putative miR21-binding sites in PPP2R2B.
  (B) Luciferase reporter assay of HTR8/SVneo cells cotransfected with PPP2R2B WT
  or MUT reporter plasmids with miR21 mimic or mimic NC; n = 3, one-way ANOVA and
  Tukey’s multiple comparison test, ∗p < 0.05 versus the PPP2R2B WT + mimic NC group
  (WT + NC mimic). (C) RT-qPCR of PPP2R2B in HTR8/SVneo cells transfected with miR21
  mimic or miR21 inhibitor; n = 3, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test,
  ∗p < 0.05 versus mimic NC; #p < 0.05 versus inhibitor NC. (D) RT-qPCR of PPP2R2B
  in normal and preeclamptic term placentae; n = 6 in each group, two-tailed t test,
  ∗p < 0.05. (E) Western blotting of PP2A Bβ in normal and preeclamptic term placentae;
  n = 6, two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05. (F) Western blotting of PP2A Bβ in PHTs; n =
  3, two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05. Reciprocal coIP of (G) PP2A Bβ and LATS1 in human
  placenta (left), PP2A Bβ and LATS1 in PHTs (middle), and PP2A Bβ and LATS1 in HTR8/SVneo
  cells (right). pcDNA3 or pc-PPP2R2B plasmid-transfected HTR8/SVneo cells were cotransfected
  with mimic NC or miR21 mimic for 6 h, cultured in fresh medium for 48 h, and then
  subjected to (H) western blotting of PP2A Bβ, p-LATS1Thr1079, LATS1, p-YAPSer127,
  and YAP. (I) Western blotting of YAP in cytoplasm and nuclei. (J) IF staining of
  YAP (red) and DAPI (blue) (scale bar, 100 μm); (K) Matrigel Transwell assay (scale
  bar, 400 μm); (L) wound-healing assay (scale bar, 100 μm); (M) EdU assay; and (N) flow
  cytometry for the measurement of apoptosis by staining with Annexin V-FITC and PI;
  n = 3, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05
  versus the pcDNA3 + mimic NC group; #p < 0.05 versus the pc-PPP2R2B + mimic NC group;
  and p < 0.05 versus the pcDNA3 + miR21 mimic group. The data are presented as the
  means ± SEMs.'
