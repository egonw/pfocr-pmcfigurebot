caption: 'Representation of metabolism and growth in metabolic heat equivalents. H0:
  heat equivalent produced by the initial amount of nutrients if metabolized in a
  single biochemical pathway by cultured cells. Hf: heat equivalent of the amount
  of nutrients that generates half-maximal metabolic thermal power (analogous to a
  Langmuir adsorption constant describing half-maximal binding site occupation on
  a catalytic surface A). ΔH: heat released by a cell during the time Δt between cell
  divisions (symbolized by arrows). ΔA: increment in apparently catalytic surface
  A due to formation of a new cell. H(t): accumulated released heat up to time t in
  proportion to the amount of biomass; the latter provides an apparent nutrient-adsorbing
  total catalytic surface A. Θ: “metabolic load” describing the fraction of occupied
  nutrient-binding sites on A (H0− H(t) scales with the amount of nutrients at time
  t). P: thermal power of a culture of microorganisms expressed as the product of
  released heat H, maximal growth rate r0 (Methods, Equations (1a) and (1b) and condition
  for Equation (3c)) and ”metabolic load” Θ.'
