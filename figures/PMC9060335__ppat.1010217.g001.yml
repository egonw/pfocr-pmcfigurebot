figure_title: ALCScV infection influences the gibberellin (GA) pathway in N. benthamiana
  plants
caption: (A) Photographs of the mock-, ALCScV- and ALCScV-mC4-inoculated N. benthamiana
  plants taken at 28 dpi. The results were reproduced in three independent experiments
  using 10 plants per treatment. (B) qRT-PCR analyses of the relative expression of
  GA pathway-associated genes in mock- or ALCScV-inoculated N. benthamiana plants.
  ** indicates a significant difference between the two treatments at the P < 0.01
  level by Studentâ€™s t-test; * indicates a significant difference between the two
  treatments at the P < 0.05 level. These experiments were performed with three independent
  biological replicates with similar results. (C) and (D) Results of HPLC analyses
  showing the contents of endogenous GA in the PVX-, PVX-C4-, mock-, ALCScV-, and
  ALCScV-mC4-inoculated N. benthamiana plants at 14 dpi, respectively. Different letters
  above the bars indicate significant differences (P < 0.05).
