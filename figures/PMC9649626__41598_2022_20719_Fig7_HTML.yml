caption: The effects of COS on the oxidative stress injury indicators and expression
  level of TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway protein from kidney tissues in UUO-induced
  renal fibrosis mice. SOD levels (A). GSH levels (B). GSH-Px levels (C). MDA levels
  (D). Representative Western blot analysis bands of TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway
  protein (E). Quantitative statistical chart from western blot analysis of p-Smad2/Smad2
  and p-Smad3/Smad3 proteins (F). Quantitative statistical chart from western blot
  analysis of TGF-β1, Smad7 and Smad4 proteins (G). The original bands of Western
  blot from (E) were shown in the Supplementary Fig. . All values are represented
  as mean ± SD (n = 10 in each group). Superscript letters a and b designate significant
  differences. aP < 0.05 compared with the model group. bP < 0.01 compared with the
  model group.
