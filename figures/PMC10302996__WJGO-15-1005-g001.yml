caption: 'Expression profiles of transfer RNA-related fragments and transfer RNA halves
  in paired sessile serrated lesions and normal control groups. A: Hierarchical clustering
  analysis of transfer RNA (tRNA)-related fragment (tRF)- and tRNA halves (tiRNAs)-expression
  data obtained from paired sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) and normal control (NC)
  groups. Cluster analysis arranged samples into groups based on the counts per million.
  All samples were categorized in 10 clusters using K-means clustering. B: Principal
  component analysis showed a distinguishable tRF- and tiRNA-expression profile among
  SSLs and NC. C: Venn diagram based on the number of basically expressed and specifically
  expressed tRFs and tiRNAs. D: Heatmap revealed results of dysregulated tRFs and
  tiRNAs obtained using hierarchical clustering analysis. SSLs: Sessile serrated lesions;
  NC: Normal control; PCA: Principal component analysis.'
