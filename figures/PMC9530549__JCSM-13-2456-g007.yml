caption: Study design flow chart for metabolite‐based model. An untargeted metabolomics
  analysis was carried out in the plasma and urine cohort of 79 newly diagnosed idiopathic
  inflammatory myopathies (IIM) patients and 52 normal control (NC) samples. Orthogonal
  partial least‐squares discriminate analysis (OPLS‐DA) and fold change analysis were
  performed to measure the significance of metabolites. Then, the differentially expressed
  metabolites were included in 10 machine learning models to identify potential biomarkers
  in each IIM subtype. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) human metabolic pathways. The correlation
  between the shared metabolites in the plasma and urine samples of the IIM patients
  and clinical parameters was conducted by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation.
