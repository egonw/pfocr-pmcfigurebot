caption: 'The relative mRNA expressions of genes of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs)
  with human platelet lysate (hPL) treatment detected by qPCR (A). Protein bands and
  protein expression in HDFs with PL treatment (B). Data expressed as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.05
  or ##p < 0.01 vs. NC group; *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. model group by one‐way ANOVA
  followed by least significant difference multiple comparison. We repeated the experiments
  three times to ensure the accuracy of the experiments'
