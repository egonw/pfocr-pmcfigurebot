caption: Plasma metabolites in the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. (a) Hierarchical
  clustering heatmap analysis of plasma metabolomic data. Metabolite concentrations
  were normalized by dividing each concentration value with the average concentration
  measured across all patients. Higher concentrations compared with that of the average
  were represented in red, lower concentrations in blue, and concentrations similar
  to that of the average represented in white. (b) Score plot of principal component
  analysis (PCA) of plasma metabolite. The contribution ratio of PC1 and PC2 were
  26.5% and 17.8%, respectively. Red represents the fatigue group and green the non-fatigue
  group. (c) Volcano plots showing differences in metabolite concentrations between
  the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. The X- and Y-axes indicate the log2 fold change
  (fatigued/non-fatigued) and − log10P-values (Mann–Whitney U test), respectively.
  (d) Score plots of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (left-hand
  figure). The X- and Y-axes indicate the first and second components. Quantile normalization
  was performed on each sample, followed by autoscaling of the metabolite concentrations
  to eliminate sample-dependent bias. Red represents the fatigue group and green the
  non-fatigue group. Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores showing the top
  15 metabolites (right-hand figure). Higher concentrations compared with that of
  the average were represented in red and lower concentrations in blue. (e) Metabolic
  pathway-based analysis showing the top 25 enriched metabolite sets. The color intensity
  represents P-values, whereas the size of the circles represents the enrichment ratio.
  (f) Box plots of each metabolite concentration in the tryptophan metabolic pathway.
  Horizontal lines of the box indicate 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the data. The Y-axis
  indicates metabolite concentrations (μM). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U
  test).
