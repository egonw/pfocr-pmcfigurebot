caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which MALAT1 delivered by BC cell-derived
  Exo affects BC metastasis and chemoresistance. BC cell-derived Exo deliver MALAT1,
  which downregulates miR-1-3p, and upregulates VASP, thereby activating the Rap1
  signaling pathway to promote BC metastasis and chemoresistance.
