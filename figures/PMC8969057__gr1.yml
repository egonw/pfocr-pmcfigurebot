caption: 'Trial profileAML=acute myeloid leukaemia. AUL=acute undifferentiated leukaemia.
  HSCT=haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. POQR=positive outside quantifiable
  range. *Standard of care: biphenotypic leukaemia n=1, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  n=1, acute myeloid leukaemia n=1, Burkitt lymphoma n=1; standard of care plus rituximab:
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma n=2, chronic myeloid leukaemia blast phase n=1, lymphoma
  not otherwise specified n=2. †Deviations from protocol conditioning or donor. ‡Deviation
  from trial maintenance pathway. §Minimal residual disease data availability for
  risk assessment: at the end of phase 1, 422 had a result (negative, positive, POQR,
  or indeterminate), 57 had specimen processed but no target was identified, 98 had
  insufficient or missing diagnostic specimen or end of phase 1 specimen not received
  or patient off trial; at the end of phase 2, 393 had a result (negative, positive,
  POQR, or indeterminate), 43 had specimen processed but no target was identified,
  122 had insufficient or missing diagnostic specimen or end of phase 2 specimen not
  received or patient off trial. ∥Post-induction maintenance pathway includes intensification
  and four blocks of consolidation before the start of maintenance. ||Post-induction
  reduced intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT pathway also includes intensification
  before HSCT.'
