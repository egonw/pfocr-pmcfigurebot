caption: YTHDF3 mediates Cyp307a1 mRNA degradation in the ecdysone pathway. (A) Reducing
  Cyp307a1 mRNA half-life by overexpressing YTHDF3 in BmN cells. (B) Graphical representation
  of retrotranscription followed by PCR of the m6A site of Cyp307a1 and Cyp18a1. (C)
  Relative quantification of the m6A levels of Cyp307a1 and Cyp18a1 in BmN cells.
  Relative RT-QPCR data correspond to the mean and standard error of three independent
  experiments. (D) Construction of the dual-luciferase reporter assay. (E) Relative
  firefly luciferase (Fluc) activity. (F) mRNA level of Cyp307a1. Values are mean
  ± s.d. of n = 4 independent experiments. Two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used
  (** p < 0.01).
