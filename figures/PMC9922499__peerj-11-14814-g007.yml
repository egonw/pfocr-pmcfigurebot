figure_title: Gene and pathway analysis of osteoclastogenesis ATAC-Seq data
caption: (A) Volcano plots depicting genes meeting fold change and p-value thresholds
  in female and male cells. Differentials with âˆ’log10 transformed adjusted p-values
  of six and greater are plotted at the same level. Full volcano plots are included
  in . (B) Female-specific, male-specific, and common pathways altered during osteoclastogenesis.
  Pathways are listed in .
