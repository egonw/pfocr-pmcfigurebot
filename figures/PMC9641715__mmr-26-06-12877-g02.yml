caption: 'Inhibitory effect of ACT on DSS-induced colonic barrier dysfunction. (A)
  Representative immunohistochemistry images demonstrating the inhibitory effect of
  ACT on DSS-induced decreased protein expression levels of occludin and ZO-1, and
  increased protein expression levels of claudin-2. (B) Representative western blotting
  images and data demonstrating the inhibitory effect of ACT on DSS-induced decreased
  protein expression levels of occludin and ZO-1, and increased protein expression
  levels of claudin-2. n=6. ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. DSS. ACT, acteoside; DSS, dextran sulphate sodium; ZO-1, zonula occludens-1.'
