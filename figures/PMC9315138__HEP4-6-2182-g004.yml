caption: 'Differential proteins expression in OS‐9 overexpression group (n = 3) and
  vector control (n = 3) of SMMC‐7721 cells. (A) Volcano plot of the differentially
  expressed proteins. Gray dots represent genes that are not differentially expressed
  in the early recurrence group and nonrecurrence group; red dots and blue dots represent
  genes that are up‐regulated and down‐regulated significantly in the early recurrence
  group. (B) Heat map of the differentially expressed proteins. Red rectangles mean
  that genes are up‐regulated in these samples, and blue ones mean down‐regulated.
  Two hundred and sixty‐eight protein expressions were up‐regulated and 140 protein
  expressions were down‐regulated in the overexpression group compared with the vector
  control group (fold change ≥ 1.5; p < 0.05). (C) Heat map of the differentially
  expressed proteins classified to the hypoxia‐inducible factor 1 (HIF‐1) and tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. (D) Ridgeline plot of Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment for differentially expressed proteins. (E)
  Gene Ontology functions for differentially expressed proteins. The left side of
  the circle includes all related genes, and the right side displays the Gene Ontology
  terms. Red and blue rectangles mean that genes are up‐regulated and down‐regulated
  in the early recurrence group. Abbreviations: ALDOA, aldolase, fructose‐bisphosphate
