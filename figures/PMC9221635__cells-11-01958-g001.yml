caption: Overview of the connections between telomere maintenance and the cGAS-STING
  pathway in the nucleus and mitochondria of cancer cells. Cancer cells overcome the
  proliferation limit from telomere shortening by telomere maintenance mechanisms.
  Molecules involved in telomere maintenance also have noncanonical functions in the
  mitochondria. The mitochondrial functions of telomere-related molecules protect
  cancer cells from various stresses. The long-lasting cancer cells change the surrounding
  environment pro-tumorigenic by the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in normal
  cells surrounding cancer cells, as well as in cancer cells.
