caption: 'Transcript levels of genes in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway during
  room temperature and cold storage: MAM1 (a), MAM3 (b), ESM1 (c), CYP79 (d), ESP25
  (e), FMO-GSOX1 (f), ST582 (g), and ADP2 (h). The transcript levels of each candidate
  gene are reported as the relative expression to Actin from samples stored at 25 °C
  (red) or 4 °C (blue) and sampled on days 1, 3, and 5. The genes encoding key enzymes
  are highlighted in yellow. The y-axis is the relative expression of each gene that
  was normalized using actin as an internal control. Data represents means ± SE bars
  (n = 3). The key enzymes were highlighted in yellow. Asterisks (∗) indicate statistically
  significant differences from day 1 (control) to day 3 or day 5 (storage temperature
  conditions) (P < 0.05).'
