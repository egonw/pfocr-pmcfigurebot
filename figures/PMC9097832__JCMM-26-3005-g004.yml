caption: 'FGF21 inhibit mTORC1/EIF4EBP1 axis in vivo. (A) GSEA plot of mTORC1 gene
  set. The NES was 1·239, indicated mTORC1 signalling pathway was up‐regulated in
  H group. (B) Upper panel: Western blotting detected p‐mTOR, and mTORC1 expression
  levels in lung tissue homogenates of H group and H plus F21 group. Bottom panel:
  Quantitative analysis of p‐mTOR and mTOR expression levels of each group (n = 4).
  (C) Upper panel: Western blotting detected TCS1 expression levels in each group.
  Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis of TCS1 expression levels of each group (n =
  3). (D) Upper panel: Western blotting detected p‐EIF4EBP1 and EIF4EBP1 expression
  levels in each group. Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis of p‐EIF4EBP1 and EIF4EBP1
  expression levels of each group (n = 4). (E) Upper panel: Western blotting detected
  p‐S6K, and S6K expression levels in each group. Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis
  of p‐S6K and S6K expression levels of each group (n = 3). (F) Upper panel: Western
  blotting detected p‐mTOR, and mTORC1 expression levels in lung tissue homogenates
  of H group, and H plus F21 KO group. Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis of p‐mTOR
  and mTOR expression levels of each group (n = 3). (G) Upper panel: Western blotting
  detected TCS1 expression levels in each group. Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis
  of TCS1 expression levels of each group (n = 3). (H) Upper panel: Western blotting
  detected p‐EIF4EBP1 and EIF4EBP1 expression levels in each group. Bottom panel:
  Quantitative analysis of p‐EIF4EBP1 and EIF4EBP1 expression levels of each group
  (n = 4). (I) Upper panel: Western blotting detected p‐S6K, and S6K expression levels
  in each group. Bottom panel: Quantitative analysis of p‐S6K, and S6K expression
  levels of each group (n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± SEM, unpaired two‐tailed
  Student''s t‐test, compared with H group, *p < 0·05, **p < 0·01, ***p < 0·001, ****p
