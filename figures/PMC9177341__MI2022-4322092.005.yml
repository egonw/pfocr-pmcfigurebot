caption: Pulmonary chemokines, cytokines, and TLR/MyD88 signal of recombinant murine
  IL-21- (rIL-21-) administrated wild-type (WT) mice in response to Chlamydia muridarum
  (C. muridarum) lung infection. The rIL-21 and PBS-treated mice were killed at days
  0, 3, 7, and 14 after C. muridarum infection, and total RNA was extracted from the
  lung tissues to analyze mRNA expression. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results
  of chemotactic factors (a–f) KC, MIP-2, CXCR2, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α as well as
  TLR/MyD88 pathway mediators (g–j) TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and p65 were shown. Data are
  represented as means ± SD from n = 3–4 per group, representative one of three independent
  experiments. Statistical significances of differences are determined by two-way
  ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
