caption: 'Influences of patchouli alcohol (PA) on oxidative stress and expression
  of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway of chondrocytes mediated by D-gal. (a) Effect of
  PA on gene expression of catalase (Cat), glutathione synthetase (Gss), and superoxide
  dismutase 1 (Sod1) in D-gal-caused senescent chondrocytes was analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  (b) PA''s effects upon antioxidant indices (CAT and SOD) generation by chondrocytes
  administrated with D-gal (5 mg/ml) and PA (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h were determined
  by biochemical kit. (c) Representative fluorescent images of ROS levels in D-gal
  (5 mg/ml) induced senescent chondrocytes treated with 10 μM PA for 24 h. Scale bar,
  50 μm. (d) The RT-qPCR was employed to detect the gene expression of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway,
  including nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1),
  NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1), and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
  (Keap1), mediated by D-gal in aging chondrocytes. (e) Representative immunofluorescence
  pictures of Nrf2 were captured in D-gal (5 mg/ml) induced senescent chondrocytes.
  Nrf2 was stained with Nrf2-specific antibody (red staining), while the nucleus was
  stained with DAPI (blue staining). Scale bar, 50 μm. (f) The expression and quantitative
  analysis of Nrf2 protein in the nucleus and HO-1 protein in the cytoplasm were assessed
  through western blotting. The Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression levels are the gray
  value ratio of the target protein to lamin B and β-actin, respectively. Mean ± SEM.
  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05 vs. D-gal group.'
