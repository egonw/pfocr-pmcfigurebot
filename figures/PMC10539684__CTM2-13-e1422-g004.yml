caption: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) inhibited Ying Yang 1 (YY1) ubiquitination
  and promoted plasticity in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. (A) Culture model of LNCaP
  cells in charcoal‐stripped fetal bovine serum (CS‐FBS) (left); quantitative reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) analyses show YY1, N‐cadherin,
  and SYP at different time points (right). (B) Western blotting was used to detect
  YY1, N‐cadherin, and SYP expression in LNCaP cells under CS‐FBS for the indicated
  times. (C) Culture model of 22Rv1 cells in enzalutamide (left); RT qPCR analyses
  showed YY1, N‐cadherin, and SYP expression at different time points (right). (D)
  Western blotting was used to detect YY1, N‐cadherin, and SYP expression in 22Rv1
  cells under enzalutamide for the indicated time. (E) Western blotting was used to
  observe YY1, N‐cadherin, and SYP expression in LNCNE and 22RNE cells after YY1 knockdown.
  (F) Impact of ADT‐induced neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells
  on YY1 ubiquitination. Cell lysates of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and
  PCa cells were immunoprecipitated with anti‐YY1 and analyzed by western blotting.
  (G) Cells were subjected to western blotting to detect the level of Smurf2 protein.
  (H) LNCaP and LNCNE cells were treated with 10 μg/mL of cycloheximide (CHX) for
  the indicated times and harvested for western blotting. n.s, not significant, *p < .05,
  **p < .01.
