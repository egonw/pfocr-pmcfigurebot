caption: 'Discriminant metabolites in the 3,5-DCAA-primed and naïve barley plants
  after infection with Ptt and summary of the MetPA-generated metabolic pathways in
  the naïve and primed infected plants. (A): Metabolite class distribution. (B): Dendrogram
  heatmap showing the extent of metabolomic reconfiguration as reflected by the relative
  concentration of all metabolites across all conditions (Control, DCAA + Ptt, and
  Ptt) and all timepoints (2, 4, and 6 d.p.i.). Brown = high concentration; blue =
  low concentration. (C): Pathway mapping in naïve infected plants. (D): Pathway mapping
  in primed infected plants revealing some of the main metabolic pathways involved
  in the plants’ (naïve and primed) interaction with Ptt. The colour and sizes of
  the circles are based on p values and pathway impact values, respectively. The circles
  with large pathway impact values and small p values are significantly perturbed.'
