caption: The response of RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz to DNA damage is regulated by the occupancy
  of Fun30 and H3K56ac on RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 genes. (A). The occupancy of Fun30myc
  was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters
  in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in untreated cells. (B). The occupancy of H3K56ac
  was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters
  in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in untreated cells. (C). The occupancy of Fun30myc
  was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters
  in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in cells treated with H2O2 (7.5 mM). (D). The
  occupancy of H3K56ac was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1,
  and RAD5 promoters in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in cells treated with H2O2
  (7.5 mM). (E). The occupancy of Fun30myc was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1,
  MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promotes in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in cells
  treated with CPT (100 µM). (F). The occupancy of H3K56ac was analyzed on FUN30,
  RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz
  in cells treated with CPT (100 µM). (G). The occupancy of Fun30myc was analyzed
  on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters in FUN30myc and
  RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in cells treated with MMS (0.02%). (H). The occupancy of H3K56ac
  was analyzed on FUN30, RTT109, SNF2, TEL1, MEC1, RAD9, MRC1, and RAD5 promoters
  in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz in cells treated with MMS (0.02%). The data
  is presented as average ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates. * p < 0.05.
