caption: Enriched metabolic pathways in the third stage of obesity, MetaboAnalyst
  4.0/5.0, web-version. (a) DIMS mass-spectra after processing with the DataAnalysis/MatLab
  pipeline were analyzed by the MSEA tool. (b) DIMS mass-spectra after MALDIquant/Mummichog
  pipeline processing were analyzed with the Pathway Analysis tool. “Match Status”
  indicates the number of annotated metabolites/number of known metabolites of the
  KEGG pathway.
