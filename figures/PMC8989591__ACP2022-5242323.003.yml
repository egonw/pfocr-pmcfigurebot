caption: 'Expression of molecules related to TGF-β signaling pathway, antioxidants,
  inflammation-associated cytokines, and apoptosis-related molecules at 24 h after
  I/R and another 72 h after H9C2 cells were transfected with shRNA-TGF-β. (a and
  b) Expression of TGFβ, p-Smad2/3, Smad4, Smad6, and Smad7 in the cells from the
  control group and I/R group at 24 h after I/R (Western blotting). (c) The thiobarbituric
  acid method was employed to detect MDA level. (d) The hydroxylamine method was used
  to detect SOD. (e–g) Serum levels of CK, LDH, and AST were detected with corresponding
  ELISA kits. (h–j) Inflammation-related factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) were detected
  with corresponding ELISA kits. (k and l) Expression of BCL-2, Bax, and caspase-3
  (Western blotting). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, IR group vs. NC group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001, IR-sh
  TGF-β group vs. IR group.'
