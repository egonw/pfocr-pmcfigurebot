figure_title: M2 TAMs infiltrate into pulmonary SCLC site
caption: A GSEA plots showing the enrichment of the inflammatory response pathway
  in the primary site. B A heatmap showing expression levels of genes associated with
  the inflammatory response in primary tumors versus liver metastasis. C Lungs were
  excised from tumor-bearing mice and pulmonary SCLC tumors were isolated. Gross specimens
  and H&E-stained images of lungs are shown. White arrows point to the SCLC site.
  Con, untreated control mice. SCLC, mice injected with SCLC cells through tail vein.
  D Flow cytometry analysis of the polarization state of infiltrated macrophages in
  the lung tumor site of the SCLC nude mouse allograft model (n = 5). E qRT-PCR analysis
  of NLRP6 expression in lung tumor site from the SCLC nude mouse allograft model
  (n = 5). F Immunoblot analysis of NLRP6 expression in lung tumor site from the SCLC
  nude mouse allograft model (n = 5). Para, para-cancerous tissue. SCLC, SCLC cancerous
  tissue. Bar graphs show the mean ± SEM; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. TAMs tumor-associated
  macrophages, SCLC small cell lung cancer, GSEA gene set enrichment analysis, H&E
  hematoxylin and eosin, SEM standard error of mean.
article_title: NLRP6 is required for cancer-derived exosome-modified macrophage M2
  polarization and promotes metastasis in small cell lung cancer.
