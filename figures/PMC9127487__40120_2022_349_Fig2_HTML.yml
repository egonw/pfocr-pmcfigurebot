caption: The effect of DMTs on the immune system in MS. (1) S1P receptor modulators
  prevent autoreactive lymphocytes from egressing from the lymph nodes via S1P receptor
  downregulation. (2) Endothelial migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the
  blood–brain barrier is blocked by anti-α4-integrin activity. (3) Immunosuppression
  and lymphocyte cell death to varying degrees are driven via inhibition of DNA synthesis
  and repair mechanisms and anti-CD52 activity. (4) B-cell depletion and death via
  B-cell-specific anti-CD20 activity. (5) Glatiramer acetate mimics myelin basic protein
  to redirect inflammatory responses; fumarate therapies downregulate the Nrf2 pathway
  to slow inflammation. (6) Interferon therapies mimic interferons to upregulate inherent
  immunosuppressive mechanisms of the regulatory immune system. CD cluster of differentiation,
  DMT disease-modifying therapy, Nrf2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2,
