figure_title: Metabolic / proteomic analysis of bile-acid-related pathways in complex-IV-deficient
  livers
caption: (A) Left, volcano plot of identified proteins from the Bile Acid Metabolic
  Process (GO:0008206) pathway, based on proteomics performed on Cox10-/- vs. Cox10f/f
  livers at 8 weeks post-AAV administration. Significantly up or downregulated proteins
  are indicated in black. Right, GSEA of pathway components; the normalized enrichment
  score (NES) and nominal p-value are indicated. (B) Schematic of bile acid metabolic
  pathways. Metabolites are listed in lower case, proteins are listed in upper case.
  Each protein or metabolite is color coded on whether it was detected and/or significantly
  changed between Cox10-/- and Cox10f/f livers. For mitochondrial proteins, we classified
  proteins based on whether they were significantly up or downregulated in either
  the whole cell lysate or enriched mitochondrial dataset. ABCB11 refers to the transporter
  which exports bile acids from hepatocytes into the biliary duct. Rate-limiting enzymes
  are indicated in boxes. d-cholate, deoxycholate. l-cholate, lithocholate. ud-cholate,
  ursodeoxycholate. cd-cholate, chenodeoxycholate. m-cholate, muricholate. g-cholate,
  glycocholate. t-cholate, taurocholate. gcd-cholate, glycochenodeoxycholate. tcd-cholate,
  taurochenodeoxycholate. Numerical data for individual panels are provided in .
