caption: Regulation of the number of PCa migrating cells by USP8, and the anti-migrating
  action of docetaxel in Transwell assay through regulation of EMT-related proteins.
  (A) Scrambled or USP8-specific siRNA was transfected into PCa cells. Docetaxel was
  used to treat transfected cells before they were introduced to the Transwell chamber.
  The migrating cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde before being imaged (100×).
  (B) Mock or pCMV3-USP8-overexpressing vector was transfected into PCa cells. Docetaxel
  was used to treat transfected cells before they were introduced to the Transwell
  chamber. The migrating cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde before being
  imaged (100×). (C, D) ImageJ software was used to determine the number of migratory
  cells, which was shown on a graph. Data are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3, *p
  < 0.05). The DU145 and PC3 cells were transfected with SiUSP8 (E) and pCMV3-USP8-overexpressing
  vector (F) for 48 h; total protein was extracted and incubated with antibody (E-cadherin
  and N-cadherin) after executing Western blotting. GAPDH was utilized as a control
  in Western blotting. (G, H) The relative gray value was measured using ImageJ software
  and plotted on a bar diagram by GraphPad prism. The data were standardized using
  GAPDH as a loading control and given as mean ± SD (n = 3, *p < 0.05).
