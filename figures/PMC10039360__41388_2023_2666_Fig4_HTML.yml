figure_title: LZTFL1 induces cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition
caption: a GO terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between lower and upper
  quartile expression of LZTFL1 in TCGA-ccRCC cohort. Count indicates the number of
  DEGs enriched in the pathway. GeneRatio indicates the ratio of enriched DEGs to
  background genes. b Flow cytometry cell cycle analysis of ACHN and A498 cells stably
  overexpressing LZTFL1 and knockdown, respectively, and their respective control
  cells (left panels). Percentages (%) of cell populations at different cell cycle
  phases (right panels). mean ± SD of three independent experiments, *, P < 0.05,
  **, P < 0.01, unpaired student t test. c Representative immunofluorescent staining
  of Edu (red) and DAPI (blue) of cells indicated (left panel) and % of Edu-positive
  cells (right panel). Mean ± SD of three independent experiments, ***, P < 0.001,
  ****, P < 0.0001, unpaired student t test. scale bar is 60 μm.
