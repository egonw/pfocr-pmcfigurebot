caption: The lipids that were altered in the Abca7 knockout mouse brain and affected
  cellular pathways. Sixty-one lipid subclasses were identified in the mouse brain
  and those that were altered in the male and female Abca7 KO mice are shown. Up arrow
  indicates increased levels in the KO compared with WT mice. Down arrow indicates
  decreased levels in the KO compared with WT mice. Brown text indicates lipids altered
  in the cell signalling pathway. Blue text indicates lipids altered in sterol metabolism
  pathway. Green text indicates lipids altered in mitochondrial function pathway.
  Purple text indicates lipids altered in the neuroprotection pathway.
