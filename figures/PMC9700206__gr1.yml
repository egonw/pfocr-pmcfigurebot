caption: Metabolic pathways leading to lignin monomers.Only the route toward lignin
  monomers is shown; side branches of the pathway that result in soluble metabolites
  are not shown, with the exception of ferulic acid conjugates (see footnote2). As
  enzymes may have different substrates and pathway perturbation may induce branching
  pathways, the figure includes only metabolic conversions for which strong evidence
  exists of involvement in biosynthesis of the shown end products. A question mark
  “?” means that the enzymes catalyzing the metabolic conversion(s) are not known.
  C3H, p-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE; CHI, CHALCONE ISOMERASE; other abbreviations can
  be found in the manuscript text. 1The exact structures of the 4-dihydroxybenzoate
  conjugates are not known. 2Only a small portion of the ferulic acid pool is integrated
  into the lignin polymer; the majority of the pool is metabolized to soluble ferulic
  acid conjugates. 3The conversion of coniferin to coniferyl alcohol (which subsequently
  serves as a monomer for lignification) and glucose occurs in the apoplast of gymnosperm
  trees. Studies in Ginkgo biloba, Pinus contorta, Picea abies (Norway spruce), and
  Chamaecyparis obtusa (Japanese cypress) indicate that coniferin is a transport form
  of coniferyl alcohol in these species (; ; ; ).
