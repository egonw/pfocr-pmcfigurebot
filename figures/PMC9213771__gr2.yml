caption: 'Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 KO screen identifies regulators of S1P cellular
  uptake and recycling into the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. A: Schematic of the
  genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 KO screening strategy undertaken to identify genes required
  for S1P uptake and recycling. WT Cas9-expressing HeLa cells (gray); SPTLC1 KO Cas9-expressing
  HeLa cells (light blue). Cells were transduced (MOI of 0.25) with a lentivirus-based
  genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 KO library and selected in puromycin to yield cells that
  each contained approximately one viral genome. Cells were grown in media containing
  S1P (orange) to induce Gb3 cell-surface expression and treated either with or without
  Shiga toxin. The genomic DNA of cells from each group was subjected to deep sequencing
  to identify the sgRNAs. B: Scatterplot showing the ranking of genes from MAGeCK
  analysis. X-axis indicates positive ranking of individual genes, and y-axis indicates
  -Log10 values of corresponding robust ranking aggregation (RRA) score. The 10 top-ranking
  genes are highlighted and labeled. Inset panel, scatterplot showing log-fold change
  for all genes. The genes for enzymes directly involved in Gb3 synthesis are marked
  with asterisks. The genes shown in red are involved in the S1P uptake and recycling
  pathway. C: Schematic showing sphingolipid synthesis pathway leading to the production
  of Gb3 in SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells. Top-ranking genes from the screen that are directly
  involved in Gb3 synthesis are marked with asterisks. PLPP3 (PPAP2B) and SGPP1, which
  are not involved in de novo synthesis of Gb3 (, , , ), are involved in the S1P uptake
  and recycling pathway. CRISPR, clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic
  repeats; Gb3, globotriaosylceramide; MAGeCK, Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide
  CRISPR-Cas9 KO; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PM, plasma membrane; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate;
  sgRNA, single guide RNA.'
