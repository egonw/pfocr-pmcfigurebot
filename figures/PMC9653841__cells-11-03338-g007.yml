caption: 'The effect induced by ADSC and HGF cotreatment on the reduction of collagen
  deposition in fibrotic livers of diabetic mice. (A) Gomori’s trichrome staining
  kit. (a) Control group: no significant collagen deposition; (b) LF group: significant
  collagen deposition with pseudo-lobular separation; (c) LFC group: aspect almost
  similar to the LF group; (d) ADSC and (e) HGF groups: less collagen deposition compared
  with the LF and LFC; (f) ADSC + HGF—few thin collagen septa; green collagen; scale
  bar: 50 μm. (B). RT-PCR analysis of collagen 1 (Col 1) gene levels. Legend: Control,
  LF—liver fibrosis in diabetic mice; LFC—self-recovery of liver fibrosis (positive
  control) in diabetic mice; ADSC—ADSC treatment of liver fibrosis in diabetic mice;
  HGF—HGF treatment of liver fibrosis in diabetic mice; ADSC + HGF—ADSC and HGF cotreatment
  of liver fibrosis in diabetic mice; *** p < 0.001 compared with the control; ###
  p< 0.001 compared with the LF group; ^^^ p < 0.01 compared with the LFC group.'
