caption: Dysregulated biological processes and pathways in PodoA3−. (A) GO enrichment
  analysis for downregulated biological processes included extracellular matrix (ECM)
  organization and cell differentiation (B) ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion
  and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were significantly downregulated in PodoA3− (KEGG
  database).
