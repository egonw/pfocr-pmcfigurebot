caption: α1-NKA Signalosome. (a,b) Heat map and volcano plots showing differential
  gene expressions in pNaKtide-treated vs. -untreated human HCC cell lines (n = 5).
  Significant changes were observed in genes that play key roles in PI3K → Akt pathway.
  Red color indicates genes with high expression levels, green color indicates genes
  with low expression levels and blue indicates unchanged genes (Novogene, Sacramento,
  CA, USA). (c) Data showing significant increase in the activation of phospho-Akt
  and phospho-S6k1 in untreated human HCC cell lines when compared with pNaKtide-treated
  cells (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, by ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test, n = 4–6). (d)
  MTT assay of the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors, wortmannin, PP2 and AG490, in the
  Hep3B cell line. Observe the significant arrest of cell proliferation following
  drug administration. (e) Survivin over-expression in α1-NKA Knockdown (siRNA) cells
  from two human HCC cell lines (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). Representative Western blots
  showing a1 Na/KATPase, surviving, and tubulin expression in control siRNA and targeted
  iRNA transfected cells are shown. (f) Digoxin induced upregulation of survivin expression
  in the Hep3B cell line. Note an abrogation of digoxin effect on cells exposed to
  pNaKtide (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
