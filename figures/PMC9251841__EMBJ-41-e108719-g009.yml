figure_title: Additional mechanistic insights into cell volume responses mediated
  by hydrostatic pressure
caption: 'Lysates from cells treated for 40 min with Torin (1 μM) or Rapamycin (0.5 μM)
  compared to control cells were analysed by immunoblots for the levels of the mTORC1
  substrate S6K, pS6K and GAPDH (loading control). Note the levels of pS6K are drastically
  decreased in Torin‐ and Rapamycin‐treated HEK293A cells, highlighting that these
  drugs effectively inhibits S6K phosphorylation.Cells treated with Torin (1 μM) and
  Rapamycin (0.5 μM) as in (A) and analysed by DHM to obtain their optical cellular
  volume. Each dot represents a single cell from three independent experiments. Forty
  minutes Torin or Rapamycin treatment does not affect steady‐state cell volume. Error
  bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc. P = 0.5709
  (con vs. Torin), P > 0.9999 (con vs. Rapamycin) and P > 0.9999 (Torin vs. Rapamycin).WT
