caption: LHX6‐4 isoform overexpression promoted cell growth, inhibited cell apoptosis,
  and advanced cell cycle in vitro. (A) qRT‐PCR and western blot were used to verify
  the overexpression efficiency of LHX6‐4 isoform in HeLa and SiHa cells. (B‐F) Cell
  proliferation was measured by CCK‐8 (B), EdU incorporation assay (C, D) and colony
  formation assay (E, F) in HeLa and SiHa cells. (G‐J) Cell apoptosis and cell cycle
  were measured by flow cytometry. (K) Expression level of p53, p21, cyclinD1, and
  cleaved‐PARP were detected by western blot. The data were presented as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
