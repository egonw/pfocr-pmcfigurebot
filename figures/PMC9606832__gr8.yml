caption: 'The IL6/JAK2/STAT3/cyclin D1 pathway of acute inflammation response to PHx
  is suppressed significantly in Gmfb KO mice. (A) Rank using gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) for the up-expressed gene sets (RNA-seq) associated with comparison
  of WT 24 hours vs Gmfb KO 24 hours after PHx. Of the top 10 gene sets of enrichment,
  the top 5 have statistical significance (defined by |NES| > 1, FDR q value < 0.25).
  n = 2 mice for each group. (B) GSEA plot showing an enrichment of the differently
  expressed gene sets (RNA-seq) associated with IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling in comparison
  with WT 24 hours vs Gmfb KO 24 hours after PHx. n = 2 mice for each group. (C) Heatmap
  showing the gene expression values (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million
  mapped reads) of indicated genes (RNA-seq) associated with IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling
  in comparison with WT and Gmfb KO groups. n = 2 mice for each group. (D) Expression
  levels of IL6, TNF, and IL1β messenger RNA and their proteins in liver from mice
  groups at the indicated time points after PHx. n = 4 mice for each group. Two-tailed
  t test, ∗P < .05, ∗∗∗P < .001, vs WT controls. (E) Representative immunochemical
  images in liver sections showing IL6 (anti-IL6, brown) distribution and quantification
  of IL6-positive staining density. Scale bar: 50 μm. n = 3 mice for each group. Two-tailed
  t test, ∗P < .05, ∗∗∗P < .001, vs WT controls. (F) Expression levels of p-JAK2,
  JAK2, p-STAT3, STAT3, and CCND1 proteins in liver from Gmfb KO and WT mice at the
  indicated time points after PHx. n = 5 mice for each group. Two-tailed t test, ∗P
  < .05, ∗∗P < .01, and ∗∗∗P < .001, vs WT controls. (G) Representative immunofluorescent
  images in liver sections from Gmfb KO and WT mice after PHx showing Kupffer cell
  (anti-F4/80, green; DAPI, blue) distribution and quantification of positive cell
  numbers per section. Scale bar: 50 μm. n = 4 mice for each group. Two-tailed t test.
  (H) Concentrations of IL6, TNF, and IL1β in culture supernatant of Kupffer cells
  treated with 20 μg/mL LPS or control. Two-tailed t test, ∗∗P < .01, ∗∗∗P < .001,
  vs WT controls. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments. CCND1,
  cyclin D1; FDR, false-discovery rate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  IOD, integrated optical density; NES, normalized enrichment score.'
