caption: The effect of Pentamidine on the expression of p-AKT, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins
  in EC cells. A Ishikawa cells were treated with or without indicated concentrations
  of Pentamidine for 24 h. Protein levels of AKT and p-AKT were analyzed by Western
  blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control. B Densitometric quantification
  of Western blot data presented in panel A. Data are represented as mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. *P < 0.05. C Ishikawa cells were treated with or
  without indicated concentrations of Pentamidine for 24 h. Protein levels of MMP-2
  and MMP-9 were analyzed by Western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control.
  D, E Densitometric quantification of Western blot data presented in panel C. Data
  are represented as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05. GAPDH was used as the loading control. F Ishikawa cells were respectively
  transfected with empty vector and HA-CA-AKT construct, and then treated with Pentamidine
  (15 μmol/L) or vehicle for 24 h. Protein levels of HA-tag, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
  analyzed by Western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control. The blot (HA)
  was cut prior to hybridisation with antibodies during blotting
