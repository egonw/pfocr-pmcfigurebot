figure_title: The central clock is sufficient to drive circadian rhythms of hepatic
  transcription and to restore glucose tolerance
caption: (A) Venn diagram representing the overlap of significantly oscillating (JTK,
  P < 0.01) liver transcripts between WT, Bmal1 KO mice, and Bmal1 BRE. (B) Heatmaps
  representing the oscillating transcripts in WT only (left heatmap), overlapping
  between WT and BRE (middle heatmap), and in BRE only (right heatmap). (C) Radar
  plots illustrating the phase of transcriptional oscillations in WT only (bottom
  left radar plot), overlapping between WT and BRE (top radar plot), and in BRE only
  (bottom right radar plot). (D) Graph displaying the amplitudes of the overlapping
  oscillating transcripts between WT and BRE. Significant difference was assessed
  by paired t test. (E) Pathway enrichment of oscillating transcripts overlapping
  between WT and BRE mice. (F) Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the calculated
  area under the curve (AUC) in all genotypes presented in the study. Significant
  differences were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
  the Fisherâ€™s least significant difference post hoc test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. All analyses were performed using at least n =
  3 mice.
