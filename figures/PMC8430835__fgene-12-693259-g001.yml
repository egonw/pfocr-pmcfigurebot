caption: A summary diagram of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs involved in the drug resistance
  of ovarian cancer. Several ncRNAs could participate in drug resistance of ovarian
  cancer by influencing cell apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle, autophagy, DNA
  repair, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulating the expression
  of downstream target genes and related signaling pathway.
