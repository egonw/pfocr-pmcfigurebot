figure_title: FBXO42 is a critical interactor of RBPJ and a positive regulator of
  the Notch pathway
caption: (A) Interaction network of RBPJ. high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs)
  were grouped on the basis of their cellular functions as indicated by Gene Ontology
  (GO) analysis and a literature search. Ubiquitination (Ub)/ubiquitin-like (UbL)–related
  proteins, proteins that are potential positive and negative regulators, are indicated
  by different colored dots. Signaling pathways and proteins reported to be involved
  in Notch pathway regulation are indicated by different colored texts. NER, nuclear
  excision repair; BER, base excision repair; TH1/TH2, T helper 1/2 cells. (B and
  C) Expression of L3MBTL3 (B) and Notch target genes (C) was evaluated in wild-type
  (WT) and L3MBTL3 KO HEK293T cells. (D and E) Expression of FBXO42 (D) and Notch
  target genes (E) was evaluated in WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells. (F and G) Green
  fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (F) and luciferase assays (G) were performed
  to evaluate Notch signaling activities in WT and FBXO42 KO HEK293T cells. RBPJ-BS,
  RBPJ binding site. (H to J) Expression level of FBXO42 in Notch-related cancers
  as indicated was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. (K and
  L) Expression level of FBXO42 in various cancer cell lines (K) and T-ALL cell lines
  (L) derived from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle).
  (M and N) Expression correlation of FBXO42 and Notch pathway target genes in patients
  with DLBCL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was analyzed using TCGA dataset and
  UALCAN database. (B) to (G), n = 3. Quantitative data are presented as means ± SEM
  from three independent experiments. P values were calculated using two-tailed Student’s
  t tests. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. NS, not significant; TPM,
  transcript per million.

  relaxation by promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination of RBPJ.
