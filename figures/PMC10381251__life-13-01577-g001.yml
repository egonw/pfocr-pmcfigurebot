caption: The dual role of HMGB1 expression in OSCC proliferation and bone invasion.
  OSCC cells express HMGB1 in an autocrine and paracrine manner. On the left side
  of the figure, HMGB1 produced by an OSCC cell is recognized by nearby OSCC cells
  through RAGE and TLR4 receptors, leading to the upregulation of the NF-κB pathway
  in their cell nuclei and promotion of their cell proliferation (autocrine manner).
  On the right side, HMGB1 elicited by an OSCC cell is recognized by osteoblasts,
  osteocytes, and pre-osteoclastic cells. At the former two cell types, recognition
  of HMGB1 leads to the upregulation of RANKL secretion. Regarding pre-osteoclastic
  cells, HMGB1 is recognized by RAGE and TLR4 receptors on the cell membrane. RANKL
  secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes is recognized by RANK on pre-osteoclastic
  cells. In turn, the maturation of the pre-osteoclastic cells into osteoclasts induces
  bone invasion (created with BioRender, accessed on February 2023). TLR4, toll-like
  receptor 4; RAGE, receptor for AGE; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB, RANK, receptor activator
  of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL, RANK-Ligand.
