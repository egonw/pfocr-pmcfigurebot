caption: PCAF were involved in the regulation of endothelial senescence. (a) and (b)
  Western blotting analysis and qualification of p53, p16, pH2A.X, and p21 protein
  expression and relative mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-1β in PA-treated HUVECs transfected
  with scramble or PCAF siRNA. (c) and (d) Western blotting analysis and qualification
  of p53, p16, pH2A.X, and p21 protein expression and relative mRNA expression of
  IL-6 and IL-1β in PA-treated HUVECs transfected with vector or PCAF plasmid. (e)
  and (f) SaβG staining and quantitative analysis in HUVECs transfected with scramble
  or PCAF siRNA in the presence of PA or not. Scale bars, 20 μm. (g) and (h) SaβG
  staining and quantitative analysis in HUVECs transfected with vector or PCAF plasmid
  in the presence of PA or not. Scale bars, 20 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM
  (n = 3 for each experiment. (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n.s. P > 0.05).
