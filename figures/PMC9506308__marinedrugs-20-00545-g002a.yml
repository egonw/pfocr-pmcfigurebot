caption: 'Scavenging ability of G. lemaneiformis polysaccharide and its degradation
  products. Note: (a) the ABTS+ scavenging activity of GLP, GLP-HV, GLP-H, and GLP-V;
  (b) the chelating capacity of ferrous ion of GLP, GLP-HV, GLP-H, and GLP-V; (c)
  the DPPH scavenging activity of GLP, GLP-HV, GLP-H, and GLP-V; (d) the superoxide
  radical scavenging activity of GLP, GLP-HV, GLP-H, and GLP-V; (e) the hydroxyl radical
  scavenging activity of GLP and GLP-HV. a, b, c and d in (f) represent a significant
  difference among groups on the same radical scavenging, and p < 0.05 indicates a
  significant difference.'
