caption: 'MMR deficiency is enriched in TNBCs with low Pr. (A) Comparison of the CNVs
  between the high- and low-Pr groups. The upper plot illustrates the frequency of
  the amplification, gain, loss and deletion of each gene in each group, and the lower
  plot illustrates the -log10P value of each gene when comparing the frequency of
  loss or deletion or gain or amplification between the high- and low-Pr TNBC groups.
  (B) MMR-related genes at GISTIC peaks were compared between TNBCs with high Pr and
  those with low Pr. Fisherâ€™s test P value was shown. (C) Heatmap showing the contribution
  of breast cancer-related mutational signatures to TNBCs with high and low Pr. (D)
  Cleveland plot showing the top 20 enriched pathways ordered by NES in the low Pr
  group. (E) The enrichment score of the top-enriched pathway MMR in the low Pr group
  from GSEA. (F) The correlation between Pr and HRD score. Abbreviations: Pr, promiscuity;
  LOH, loss of heterozygosity; HRD, homologous recombination deficiency. See also
