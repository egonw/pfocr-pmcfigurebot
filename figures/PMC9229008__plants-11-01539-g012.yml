caption: A proposed model for the regulatory network of EkAACT overexpression in response
  to abiotic stress. Genes involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis were upregulated
  in EkAACT-overexpressing Arabidopsis under treatment with NaCl and PEG, which promoted
  triterpenoid accumulation. Moreover, the increase in total triterpenoids enhanced
  the expression of the AtSOD and AtPOD genes in the ROS scavenging pathway and strengthened
  the activity of the SOD and POD enzymes. As a result, the salt and drought tolerance
  of EkAACT-overexpressing Arabidopsis was enhanced because of the inhibition of ROS
  formation.
