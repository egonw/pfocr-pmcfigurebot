caption: Altered protein prenylation, lipid peroxidation and increased intracellular
  ROS upon statin treatment. (A) Western analysis of tree main prenylated proteins
  (RHOA, RAS, and RAC1) of the mevalonate pathway after treatment with Atorvastatin
  (0.5 µM) and with rescue by Mevalonic acid (MEV) (100 µM) in the A673 cell line.
  MHC1 protein membrane (HLA-A) was used as control of the partitioning of membrane
  proteins. (B) Schematic representation of statins impact on mevalonate pathway,
  intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation. (C–E) Atorvastatin induced increased intracellular
  ROS in a dose-dependent manner through mevalonate pathway. (C) The graph represents
  specific MFI using CellRox probe in the A673, POE, and TC71 Ewing cell lines treated
  with 2 doses of Atorvastatin (A673 0.5 µM and 1 µM, POE 2.4 µM and 4.8 µM, TC71
  2.6 µM and 5.2 µM) (n = 3 biological replicates). (D) The A673 Ewing cell line was
  treated for 72 h with Atorvastatin at the IC50 (0.5 µM) alone or with mevalonic
  acid (MEV) (100 µM), Farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp) (10 µM), or GeranylGeranyl-pyrophosphate
  (GGpp) (10 µM) metabolites (n = 3 biological replicates). (E) Measurement of cell
  viability (Top) and intracellular ROS (Bottom) after treatment with Atorvastatin
  (IC50 × 2 = 1 µM) for 48 h associated with NAC (3 mM), an inhibitor of intracellular
  ROS in the A673 cell line (n = 3 biological replicates). (F,G) Analysis and quantification
  of γH2Ax expression by Western blot of the A673 cell line treated with 0.5 µM Atorvastatin
  for 72 h and rescued by MEV (100 µM), Fpp (10 µM), or GGpp (10 µM) (F), or by treatment
  with NAC (3 mM) (G). (H) The graph represents specific MFI using a Bodipy probe
  in the A673, POE, and TC71 Ewing cell lines treated with 2 doses of Atorvastatin
  (n = 3 biological replicates). (I) The A673 cell line was treated with 0.5 µM Atorvastatin
  alone or with MEV (100 µM), Fpp (10 µM), or GGpp (10 µM) (n = 3 biological replicates).
  Data are presented as mean +/− SD. **** p value < 0.0001, *** p value < 0.001, **
  p value < 0.01, * p value < 0.05 versus DMSO (C,H) or versus Ato treatment (D,E–I),
  unpaired Student’s t-test.
