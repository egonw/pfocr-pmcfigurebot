caption: 'DEX attenuates eosinophilic airway inflammation and mucus overproduction.
  (A) Total cell, (B) eosinophil and (C) lymphocyte counts in bronchoalveolar lavage
  fluid samples. (D) H&E and (F) PAS staining were performed to evaluate inflammatory
  cell infiltration and mucus production in lung tissues, respectively. Magnification
  for H&E staining, ×200; magnification for PAS staining, ×100; scale bar, 100 µm.
  The color imbalance was corrected as described by Marty (). Histological scoring
  of (E) inflammatory cell infiltration and (G) mucus production were based on the
  layers of cells around the airways and the percentage of PAS-positive cells, respectively.
  Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). Ordinal data are presented
  as median + interquartile range (n=7). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001 vs.
  control; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. OVA. DEX, dexmedetomidine; H&E, hematoxylin and
  eosin; ns, not significant; OVA, ovalbumin; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff.'
