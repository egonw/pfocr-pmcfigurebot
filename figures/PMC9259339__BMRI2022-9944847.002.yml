caption: 'Increased CD73 expression promotes LUAD cell proliferation in vitro. The
  (a) mRNA and (b) protein expression levels of CD73 in a human lung epithelial cell
  line (BEAS-2B) and human NSCLC cell lines (PC-9, H460, PGCL3, H1650, and A549).
  (c) The protein and (d) mRNA expression levels of CD73 in the A549 cells following
  transfection with siRNA, overexpression plasmid, or treatment with APCP. (e) Cell
  viability and (f) colony formation assays in the A549 cells following transfection
  with siRNA, overexpression plasmids, or treatment with APCP. Each experiment was
  performed three times. The data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 compared
  to control; &P < 0.05 between two groups. LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma; si: small interfering;
  NSCLC: nonsmall cell lung cancer.'
