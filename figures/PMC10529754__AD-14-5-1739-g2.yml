caption: RNA-sequencing verifies activated NPCs proliferation and YAP signaling pathway
  on rigid hydrogel. (A) Heatmap of the RNA-sequencing data showing DEGs in rat NPCs
  on soft and rigid hydrogels. (B) Volcano plot showing DEGs between rat NPCs on soft
  and rigid hydrogels. (C) Heatmap representing cell cycle- and YAP-related genes
  in rat NPCs on soft and rigid hydrogels. (D, E) KEGG pathway analysis and GO analysis
  of DEGs in rat NPCs on soft and rigid hydrogels. The top 10 results were reserved.
