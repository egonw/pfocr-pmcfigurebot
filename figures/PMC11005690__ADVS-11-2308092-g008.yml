caption: 'Effect of DPs@MMT on intestinal mucosal barrier repair and its underlying
  mechanisms. a,c) EdU staining, b,d) TUNEL staining, and e,f) Scratch healing of
  Caco2 cells post various treatments; g) DEGs in the LPS and LPS+DPs@MMT groups;
  h) Volcano plots for DEGs between LPS and LPS+DPs@MMT groups; i) GO and j) KEGG
  enrichment analysis of samples derived from LPS and LPS+DPs@MMT groups; k) DEGs
  in the MAPK pathway; l) GSEA of response to the MAPK pathway between LPS and LPS+DPs@MMT
  groups; m) DEGs in the RAS pathway; n) GSEA of response to the RAS pathway between
  LPS and LPS+DPs@MMT groups; o) Schematic illustration of the intestinal mucosal
  barrier repair effects of DPs@MMT. In Figure c,d: normal group versus other groups
  (n = 3); in Figure e: DPs@MMT group versus other groups (n = 3), ***p ≤ 0.001.'
