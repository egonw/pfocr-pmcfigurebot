caption: SAUR15 plays a key role in SAUR–BRI1 signaling pathway. A, BRI1 overexpression
  cannot rescue bin2-1 (+/−) or bin2-1 (−/−). Three-week-old seedlings grown in soil.
  Scale bars, 1 cm. B, Rosette diameter of seedlings in (A). C and D, Relative transcript
  level of SAUR15 in shoots of bin2 (C) and bri1 (D) related seedlings grown in soil
  for 2 weeks. E and F, Relative transcript level of SAUR19-24 in shoots of bin2 (E)
  and bri1 (F) related seedlings grown in soil for 2 weeks. For (B), data are mean ± standard
  deviation (n = 25). For (C–F), ACT2 was used as the reference gene. Data show mean ± standard
  deviation of three technical replicates. Experiments were repeated 3 times with
  similar results. Each biological replicates includes shoots from one seedling in
  same development stage. Different letters indicate significant differences (one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s test, P < 0.05). Primers used in (C–F) are listed in .
