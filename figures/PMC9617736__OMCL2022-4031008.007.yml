caption: 'PPI suppressed the stem cell-like properties of HCC via proteasomal degradation
  of β-catenin. (a) A cell-counting assay revealed that PPI could not significantly
  limit the number of LCSCs with β-catenin silencing. (b) Western blotting indicated
  that PPI treatment could not significantly suppress the expression of β-catenin,
  NANOG, and OCT-4 on LCSCs with β-catenin silencing. (c) Colony formation analysis
  and a sphere formation assay showed that PPI have no significant long-term inhibitory
  effects of PPI on LCSCs with β-catenin silencing. (d) Co-IP and ubiquitination experiments
  showed that the ubiquitination status of β-catenin in LCSCs was notably upregulated
  by PPI administration. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01vs. the control group; #P < 0.05
  and ##P < 0.01vs. the Sora group.'
