figure_title: Proviral role of caspase-6
caption: MERS-CoV protein, possibly the M protein, sequesters 78-kDa glucose-regulated
  protein (GRP78) and releases protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
  (PERK) for activating PERK-mediated apoptosis. Caspase-6 is activated under apoptotic
  conditions, presumably by the PERK pathway and cleaves the N protein into IFN-I
  antagonists that impede IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) translocation into the nucleus
  for inducing IFN-I expression. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
