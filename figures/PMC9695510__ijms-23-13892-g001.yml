caption: Metabolic pathway of sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin is present in the cell
  membrane and can be converted to ceramide by sphingomyelinase. Ceramidase can the
  convert ceramide into sphingosine, which is phosphorylated by the SPHKs and converted
  into S1P. Sphingosine can be converted into ceramide by ceramide synthase. S1P can
  be degraded into hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate by S1P lyase. S1P is also
  be subjected to extracellular transport by ABC transporters. S1P can be converted
  into sphingosine by sphingosine phosphate phosphatase. The arrows (black, yellow,
  dark yellow, and dotted) denote the direction of reactions. CS, ceramide synthase;
  SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase.
