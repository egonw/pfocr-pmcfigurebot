caption: 'Metabolic pathway for the production of adipic acid from (S)-lysine. The
  conversion of 2-oxoadipate to (R)-2-hydroxyadipate (reaction 4) is a key bottleneck
  in this pathway and the focus of this study. Reaction 1 is performed by an enzyme
  corresponding to E.C. 2.6.1.36, reaction 2 is catalyzed by an enzyme E.C. 1.2.1.31,
  reaction 3 is catalyzed by an enzyme E.C. 2.6.1.39, and reaction 6 is catalyzed
  by an enzyme with activity E.C.1.3.1.31. The direct conversion of (R)-2-hydroxyadipate
  to (E)-2-hexenedioate (reaction 5) has not been demonstrated. It is possible through
  the activation to 2-hydroxyadipyl-CoA, dehydration to 5-carboxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA,
  and, finally, the release of coenzyme A to yield (E)-2-hexenedioate. Abbreviations:
  2-oxoglutarate (2-OG); l-glutamate (l-Glu).'
