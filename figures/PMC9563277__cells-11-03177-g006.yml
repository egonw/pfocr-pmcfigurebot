caption: 'The expression patterns of pEIN2:VENUS and pEIN3:VENUS reporters during
  anther development. (A,B) Fluorescence images of the pEIN2:VENUS (A) and pEIN3:VENUS
  (B) before and after ethylene treatment. The dashed box in the close-up region indicate
  the tapetum layer in both (A,B). Note for the VENUS signals were appeared in tapetum
  and were enhanced in epidermis and endothecium after ethylene treatment. The green
  channel showed the VENUS signals and the red fluorescence channel showed auto-fluorescence
  of chlorophyll in epidermis (Ep) and endothecium (En). T: tapetum. Bars = 30 Î¼m.'
