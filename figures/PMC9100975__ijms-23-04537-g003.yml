caption: 'Statistics of KEGG pathway enrichment of miRNA target genes in the phloem
  and developing xylem of P. deltoides. The y-axis presents the KEGG pathway terms,
  and the x-axis presents the rich factors of the KEGG pathway terms. The calculation
  steps were as follows: the rich factor of certain KEGG pathways is equal to the
  number of genes in that pathway among miRNA target genes divided by the number of
  genes in the P. deltoides genome annotated in the pathway. The sizes and colours
  of the dots represent gene counts and p values, respectively. Larger dots indicate
  a greater number of genes, and deeper red coloration indicates a more significant
  p value.'
