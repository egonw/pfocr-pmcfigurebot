caption: Adaptation of cancer cells to oxidative stress. Activation of the RAS or
  PI3K pathway leads to elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
  causes oxidative DNA damage and, ultimately, cellular senescence. Two modes of adaptation
  have been described to enable cancer cells to avoid cellular senescence and continue
  to proliferate. Some cancer cells increase their antioxidant capabilities notably
  following genetic inactivation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)
  gene which leads to nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2) upregulation
  and the subsequent transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes. Alternatively,
  some cancer cells increase their BER capacities by overexpressing BER enzymes such
  as Pol Î², APE1, and FEN1 or auxiliary factors such as CUX1, CUX2, or SATB1. As a
  by-product of increased BER activity, these cancer cells exhibit resistance to genotoxic
  treatments like radiation therapy(IR), temozolomide (TMZ), cisplatin, or methyl
  methanesulfonate (MMS).
