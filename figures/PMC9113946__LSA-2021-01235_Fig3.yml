figure_title: DUSP4-dependent ERK activation leads to the suppression of the MITF
  pathway in mutant melanoma
caption: '(A) SKMEL28 cells were transfected with siRNA against DUSP4 or nontargeting
  control with or without trametinib (Tram) at 0.25 nM. After 48 h, cells were collected,
  and RNA-seq experiments were performed. Volcano plots display differentially expressed
  genes from the RNA-seq analysis between siDUSP4 and siNT or between siDUSP4+ Tram
  and siDUSP4 (right panel). The vertical axis (y-axis) corresponds to the mean expression
  value of log10 (q-value), and the horizontal axis (x-axis) displays the log2 fold
  change value. Positive x-values represent up-regulated genes, and negative x-values
  represent down-regulated genes. MITF target genes are labeled in red (). (B) Cells
  were treated as in (A), and 48 h later, lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. (C)
  Transcription factor activities were inferred based on the RNA-seq data using the
  msviper (Virtual Inference of Protein-Activity by Enriched Regulon analysis) algorithm.
  The activity of transcription factors was analyzed comparing y-axis: NES for siDUSP4
  versus siDUSP4+ Tram or x-axis: NES for siNT versus siDUSP4. Positive values in
  both axes represent increased activity, whereas negative values represent decreased
  activity. (D) Cells were transfected with siRNA against DUSP4, MITF, and nontargeting
  as the control. The cell growth was analyzed by measuring cell confluence over time.
  Cell growth values were normalized against time 0. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 3. Statistical
  significance was calculated between siNT versus siDUSP4 and siMITF conditions at
  108 h. (E) Lysates from transfected cells were also analyzed by immunoblotting.
  (F) BRAFV600E cells from melanoma (SKMEL28 and COLO829), colorectal cancer (LS411N),
  and glioblastoma (DBTRG-05MG) were transfected with siRNA against BRAF and DUSP4.
  The cell growth was analyzed by measuring cell confluence over time. Cell growth
  values were normalized against time 0. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 3. Statistical significance
  was calculated between siNT versus siDUSP4 and siBRAF conditions at 120 h.'
