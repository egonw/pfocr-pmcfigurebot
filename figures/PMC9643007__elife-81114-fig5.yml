figure_title: Biological peculiarities of six subtypes
caption: (A) SSEA-based analysis delineated the biological attributes inherent to
  GINS subtypes. (B) GSVA further estimated differences in pathway activity across
  six subtypes. Anova test. (C) Ten gene clusters were obtained via the soft clustering
  method (Mfuzz) in GINS2/4/5. (Dâ€“E) Enrichment analysis of gene cluster 3 (D) and
  10 (E).
