figure_title: BoNT/A treatment inhibited the activation of the classical complement
  pathway in vivo and in vitro
caption: 'a, b Immunostaining of complement C3 (a) and C1q (b) in the hippocampal
  CA1 regions. Scale bar = 5 μm. c, d Quantification of complement C3 (c) and C1q
  (d) fluorescence intensity (n = 6 images from 3 mice for each group. For C3, F (3,
  20) = 5.604, P = 0.0059). For C1q, F (3, 20) = 22.60, (P < 0.0001). e Cell viability
  of BV2 microglial cells exposed to BoNT/A (0.01 U/mL, 0.1 U/mL, and 0.5 U/mL) for
  24 h was determined by the CCK-8 assay (n = 3 replicates for each group. F (3, 8) = 7.122,
  P = 0.0120). f Complement C1q in the cell media secreted by BV2 microglial cells
  was detected by ELISA (n = 3 replicates for each group. F (3, 8) = 23.71, P = 0.0002).
  All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test
  was used. *P  <  0.05, **P  <  0.01, ***P  <  0.001, versus Con group. ##P  <  0.01,
  ###P  <  0.001, versus RSP group.'
