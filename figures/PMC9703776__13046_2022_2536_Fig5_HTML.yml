caption: Crenigacestat reduces iCCA hCAFs activation in PDX tissues. Panel A. TGFB1
  as predicted upstream regulator and its target molecules by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) in treated vs. untreated PDX tissues. Genes in red denote upregulation and
  downregulation in response to the treatment in green. Lines in orange denote predicted
  activation; lines in blue predict inhibition. Panel B. Crenigacestat downregulates
  α-SMA expression in PDX-treated mice, as detected by immunofluorescence staining.
  Vimentin (green) and α-SMA (red) in overlapping stains (yellow) co-immunolocalize
  in PDX tissues. The scale bar represents 50 μm. Panel C. The staining quantification
  was calculated as the mean intensity fluorescence of three images/tissue from PDX
  mice treated with Crenigacestat compared to the vehicle. ***p < 0.0001. Magnifications: 40X
