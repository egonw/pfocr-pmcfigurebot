caption: USP15 protein-protein interaction in BRCA. (a, b) Interaction network of
  USP15 gene derived from STRING and GeneMANIA. STRING and GeneMANIA show the interactions
  for genes linked with each other according to physical interaction, genetic interactions,
  coexpression, pathway, colocalization, and shared protein domain (c) USP15 correlation
  analysis; data from GEPIA (d) Immunoprecipitation experiments verify the interaction
  between USP15 and the Smad protein. (e) Schematic diagram of the structure in which
  USP15 functions (f) Correlation between USP15 and different proteins, data from
  TIMER.
