figure_title: Pyroptosis is executed by the gasdermin pore-forming family of proteins
caption: Canonical inflammasome signaling can activate pyroptosis through sensing
  of potentially injurious agents, including bacteria, toxins, viruses, ATP, crystalline
  material, and DAMPs. Inflammasome sensors, NLRs, AIM2 or pyrin, assemble into large
  multimeric protein complexes alongside adaptor proteins such as ASC and effectors
  such as caspase-1. Activation of the inflammasome results in caspase-1 cleavage
  of GSDMD, releasing the pore-forming N-terminal effector of pyroptosis. IL-1β and
  IL-18 are also processed by caspase-1, and released through GSDMD pores. Caspase-11/4/5
  activation downstream of cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) represents the noncanonical
  pathway to GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis, though in this instance, cytokines are
  not processed. Alternatively, ligation of death receptors or TLRs by their cognate
  ligands, can signal caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 can then trigger GSDMC/D/E pore
  formation, though a caspase-3 intermediate step is required for GSDME processing.
  Chemotherapy-induced pyroptosis has been reported to occur in a similar manner,
  with BAX and BAK activation followed by caspase-3/7 resulting in GSDME pore formation.
  Streptococcus-associated protein SpeB and Granzyme A of natural killer cells and
  cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been shown to trigger GSDMA and GSDMB, respectively,
  to initiate pyroptosis. The N-terminal of GSDMB also has the propensity to directly
  target and lyse bacteria, including Shigella, E. coli, Citrobacter and Salmonella.
