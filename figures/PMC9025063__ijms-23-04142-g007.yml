caption: The proliferative character of cells allows them to preferentially use different
  DNA repair pathways. Dividing cells are more prone to use replication-associated
  pathways, e.g., mismatch repair (MMR), ribonucleotide excision repair (RER), or
  homologous recombination (HR), whereas non-dividing cells are more likely to apply
  non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), single strand break repair (SSBR), or transcription-coupled
  nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). Direct reversal (DR), global-genome NER (GG-NER),
  and base excision repair (BER) can be used in almost all cell types, regardless
  of proliferation status. The gray area indicates the level of pathway utilization
  in dividing (top) or non-dividing (bottom) cell types. For each pathway, only a
  representative protein is shown, typically the main recognition factor. * refers
  to general BER and not the long-patch sub-pathway, which engages several replication
  proteins and thus is relatively inactive in non-dividing cells.
