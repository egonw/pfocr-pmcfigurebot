caption: Hypo-osmotic stress influences the FoxO, p53 pathways, and cell cycle in
  gill cells. (A) The relationship among FoxO, p53, and cell cycle. (B–E) Validations
  of the mRNA gene expression levels of the selected transcripts by real time qPCR.
  Down regulation of the selected transcripts (ccnb1; ccne2; plk1; and skp2) in the
  pathways. Results matched with the sequencing data. n = 5; mean ± s.e., * indicated
  p < 0.05.
