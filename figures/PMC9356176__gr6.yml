caption: 'DS cells exhibit a markedly altered glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) fluxomic profile compared to healthy control cells; effect of AOAA. Isotopologues
  present in the initial steps of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, as
  well as in de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines and in the initial steps
  of lipid biosynthesis are shown in n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8
  DS fibroblasts, as summarized in , with/without AOAA treatment (3 μM). **p ≤ 0.01
  indicates significant differences between DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; ##p ≤ 0.01
  indicates significant differences between DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
article_title: Role of the cystathionine β-synthase / H2S pathway in the development
  of cellular metabolic dysfunction and pseudohypoxia in down syndrome.
