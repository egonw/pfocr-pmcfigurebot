caption: Two patients with signaling pathway activation. (A) Patient ALL 036 showing
  positivity to the three surrogate markers pStat5, pCrkl, and pErk. (B) Patient ALL
  046 showing positivity to pCrkl and reversion produced by imatinib, and interphase
  nuclei hybridized with ABL2 break-apart FISH probe with a normal pattern (two large
  green signals in the left nucleus) and with an ABL2 breakage (one large green signal
  representing the normal gene, and two small green signals representing the broken
  gene in the rightright nucleus). White arrows represent the normal ABL2 loci and
  orange triangles represent the breakage of ABL2.The Abl pathway was assessed in
  29 patients and the surrogate marker pCrkl was positive in 10 ( and A); of these,
  7 patients presented a genetic abnormality involving CRLF2, interestingly, 4 out
  of 7 cases were also positive for pStat5. On the other hand, three of the seven
  cases showed no evidence of abnormalities in CRLF2 and the GEPs were 3.3, 6.7, and
  1.0. It was possible to analyze two patients positive to pCrkl (ALL 039 and ALL
  046) with ABL1 and ABL2 break-apart FISH probes, positive results were obtained
  for ABL2 breakage in 16% and 6% of cells analyzed, respectively. Interestingly,
  patient ALL 046 was also found to be positive for IGH::CRLF2 and showed the presence
  of both surrogate markers pStat5 and pCrkl, revealing the coexistence of both abnormalities
  in the same patient. Remarkably, this case showed pCrkl reversion using imatinib
  ( and B).
