caption: Mechanism of lncRNAs in hepatic inflammatory diseases. DEX suppresses the
  inflammatory response of hepatocytes by mediating of lncRNA TUG1/miR-194/SIRT1 axis.
  Rg3 increases the expression of lncRNA TUG1 and reduces the expression of miR-200a-3p
  to stimulate the SIRT1/AMPK pathway, thus improving liver injury. SIRT1 is involved
  in the development of liver fibrosis through the regulation of lncRNA MALAT1.
