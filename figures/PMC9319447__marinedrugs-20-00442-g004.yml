caption: 'Changes of enzymic activities related to agar biosynthesis pathway in Gracilariopsis
  lemaneiformis during the 24 h period. In the column diagram, the different lowercase
  represents significant differences with experimental time. * indicates significant
  difference between different treatments (p < 0.05). Abbreviations: CK, control treatment;
  IT, PGM inhibitor treatment. CC, Calvin cycle; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  PGM, phosphoglucomutase; UGPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; GALT, galactose-1-phosphate
  uridylyltransferase; SS, floridean starch synthase; GLA, α-galactosidase; TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate
  synthase; PMI, mannose-6-phosphate isomerase; PMM, phosphomannomutase; GMP, GDP-mannose
  pyrophosphorylase; GME, GDP-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase; GT, galactosyltransferases;
  STs/MTs/PTs, sulfotransferase, methyltransferase and pyruvyltransferase; SULF/SH,
  sulfatase and sulfate hydrolase.'
