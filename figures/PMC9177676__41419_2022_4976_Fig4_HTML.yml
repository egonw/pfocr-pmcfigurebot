figure_title: miR-199a-3p enhances stemness in ovarian cancer cells
caption: A Relative number of spheroids formed under shear stress and HGF treatment,
  and in miR-199a-3p overexpressing cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. B Expression of CD44,
  and ALDH3A1 under shear stress an HGF combined treatment, and their expression in
  miR-199a-3p overexpressing cells. C List of drug metabolism pathways in EnrichR
  database correlated with shear stress upregulated genes sets from whole cell RNA
  sequencing and expression of ALDH3A1 in miR-199a-3p overexpressing cells. D Expression
  of ABCG2 and P-gp under shear stress and HGF combined treatment, and their expression
  in miR-199a-3p overexpressing cells. Bar graph values are mean ± SD, n = 3. T-test.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005.

  drive stemness and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells via the c-Met-PI3K/Akt-miR-199a-3p
  signaling pathway.
