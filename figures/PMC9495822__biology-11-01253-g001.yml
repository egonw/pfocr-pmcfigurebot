caption: Comparison of differentially expressed genes between BMRs and mice (data
  were reanalyzed from the transcriptome data of Altwasser et al.). (a) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of consistently activated and repressed genes in BMRs (n = 4)
  when compared to mice (n = 3). The permutation of the gene set enrichment analysis
  is 10,000, and the cutoff p-value was selected as 0.05. RNA samples from BMRs represent
  the sequence data. The dot size is based on the gene count enriched in the pathway,
  and the color of the dot shows the pathway enrichment significance. Gene set enrichment
  analyses were performed with multiple test corrections (Benjamini–Hochberg). (b)
  Expression changes in JAK–STAT signaling are represented as a heatmap by using the
  transcriptome data of BMRs and mice. The columns represent individuals, and rows
  represent genes. Before creating the heatmap, raw gene expression abundances were
  scaled at the gene level, which is represented as the Z-score.
