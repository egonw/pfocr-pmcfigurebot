figure_title: Distinct signatures of CAR-T cells from patients with MG
caption: '(A) UMAP plots showing the integrating endogenous T cells and CAR-T cells
  colored by subclusters. Single-cell transcriptomics in three recently published
  external datasets (GSE197851, GSE151310, GSE197268), including (1) CAR-BCMA T cells
  in IPs from three healthy donors, (2) CAR-BCMA T cells in IPs from 1 patient with
  plasma cell leukemia, (3) T cells in 12 individual blood samples at baseline and
  CAR-CD19 T cells in 18 IPs from lymphoma patients treated with Axi-cel, and T cells
  in 8 blood samples and CAR-CD19 T cells in 13 IPs from lymphoma patients treated
  with Tisa-cel, along with our dataset including T cells at baseline and CAR- T cells
  in IPs (CT103A) from the two patients with MG, were used for signature validation.
  (B) Comparison of differentially expressed genes between CAR+ CD8+ cycling Te cells
  in the IPs from patients with MG and other IPs. CT103A, N = 4044 cells; CAR-BCMA_donor,
  N = 4739 cells; CAR-BCMA_PCL, N = 2111 cells; Axi-cel, N = 11,392 cells; Tisa-cel,
  N = 16,348 cells. Group comparisons were computed with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test
  with a Bonferroni correction. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed showing
  corresponding signaling pathways regulated by these DEGs. z score reflects the predicted
  activation level (z ≥ 2 or z ≤−2 can be considered significant). The yellow curve
  denotes the ratio between the number of the DEGs and the total number of genes in
  each of these pathways. Cell Cycle Regulation*, Cell Cycle: G1/S Checkpoint Regulation;
  Cell Cycle Regulation**, Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation; Cell
  Cycle Regulation***, Cyclins and Cell Cycle Regulation. (C) Volcano plot showing
  comparison of differentially expressed genes between endogenous Te cells from the
  MG patients at baseline and Te cells from other groups. Myasthenia Gravis, N = 2898
  cells; Lymphoma_Axi-cel, N = 7123 cells; Lymphoma_Tisa-cel, N = 4857 cells. Group
  comparisons were computed with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a Bonferroni correction.
