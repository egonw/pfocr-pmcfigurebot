figure_title: Enrichment of myeloid, lymphoid, IFN, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF signatures
  is shared among lesional DLE, PSO, AD, and SSc
caption: '(A) Hedges’ g effect sizes of cellular (left) and pathway (right) gene signatures
  for disease samples compared to their respective control samples in five DLE, three
  PSO, two AD, and three SSc datasets. Heatmap visualization uses red (enriched signature,
  >0) and blue (decreased signature, <0). Welch’s t test: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P
  < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. CART analysis for disease or control classification using
  GSVA enrichment scores in (B) DLE, (C) PSO, (D) AD, and (E) SSc. Sample numbers
  below bottom leaves represent the number of samples of each group classified into
  that leaf.'
