caption: Increased expression of genes involved in PI3K-AKT signaling in cancer-associated
  fibroblasts and cancer epithelial cells from ovarian cancer patients is associated
  with worse overall survival. A Expression levels [log2(norm_count + 1)] of ligands
  and receptors of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in ovarian cystadenocarcinoma (n = 419)
  of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) compared to normal ovarian tissues (n = 88) tissues
  of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Rows (for ligand or receptor genes) were ordered
  based on a marker selection (signal to noise) that highlights the differences in
  the expression profile [log2(norm_count + 1)] of GTEx tissues when compared to the
  TCGA tissues. Twenty genes exhibited increased expression levels and were selected
  to test their association with overall survival. B Forest plots for these twenty
  ligand and receptor genes of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in two cohorts of patients
  with ovarian cancer (TCGA, n = 557 and GSE9891, n = 264) available on the Kaplan–Meier
  (KM) plotter []. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) determined
  by Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between gene
  expression values and overall survival. The statistical significance was determined
  by a log-rank test. C Representative Kaplan–Meier curves of overall survival for
  patients with ovarian cancer (TCGA and GSE9891) based on the expression of IGF2,
  COL1A2, IGF1, and FGFR2
