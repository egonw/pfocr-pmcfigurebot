caption: Effect of the PI3K inhibitor on taurine-induced increase in TXNIP mRNA in
  human hepatic HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 20 μM LY294002 for 2
  h and then cultured in medium containing 100 mM of taurine and the inhibitor. After
  48 h, RNA was extracted and used for real-time PCR. The results are expressed as
  relative values, with the control value without LY294002 as 1. Each value is the
  mean ± S.E. (n = 4), and the ab values indicated by different characters are significantly
  different from each other and the ab values indicated by the same characters are
  not significantly different (Tukey’s test; p < 0.05).
