caption: 'HIBCH knockdown and FA treatment in hepatocytes have both similar and distinct
  metabolic effects. Huh7 liver cells were treated with and without free Fas (1:1 M
  ratio of 50 μM PA and 50 μM OA) combined with siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIBCH
  and siRNA non-targeting control for 24 h before analyses. A: HIBCH expression in
  Huh7 cells measured by mRNA sequencing (n = 6). B: Average net medium appearance
  per hour of 3-HIB and valine during a 24 h period (n = 6). C: Relative FA uptake
  in Huh7 cells treated with or without FA for 24 h, followed by addition of fluorescent
  dodecanoic acid whose uptake was detected spectrophotometrically after 1 h (n = 9–12).
  D: Principal component (PC) analysis of samples in all four treatment groups in
  the experiment are shown. E: Representative functional categories and genes in the
  four different gene expression patterns responding to FA treatment and HIBCH knockdown.
  FA, fatty acid treatment; KD, knockdown.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (Ordinary
  one-way ANOVA–Sidak''s test).'
