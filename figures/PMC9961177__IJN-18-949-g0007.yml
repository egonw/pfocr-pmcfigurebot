caption: KCs-Exo carrying MALAT1 regulated macrophage phagocytosis, apoptosis, and
  polarization via the TGFB1/SMAD3 signaling pathway. (A and B) Uptake of DiI-labelled
  KCs-Exo by PMA-treated THP-1 cells, measured by flow cytometry analysis. (C and
  D) Apoptosis in PMA-treated THP-1 cells, measured by flow cytometry analysis. (E)
  mRNA expression of apoptosis-related factors (BAX and Bcl-2), macrophage polarization-related
  surface markers (iNOS, Arg-1 and CD206), MFGE8, TGFB1 and SMAD3, determined by qRT-PCR.
  (F and G) Protein expression of apoptosis-related factors (BAX and Bcl-2), macrophage
  polarization-related surface markers (iNOS, Arg-1 and CD206), MFGE8, TGFB1 and SMAD3,
  normalized to GAPDH, determined by Western blot analysis. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001 versus the control group. Measurement data were expressed as mean
  ± SD. Comparison between two groups was conducted using independent sample t test.
  One-way ANOVA was used for data comparison among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s
  post hoc test. The experiment was repeated independently three times.
