caption: LY294002 reverses the protective effects of sufentanil on the cell permeability
  and tight junction proteins of OGD/R-induced HCMECs. HCMECs were treated with 10
  µM LY294002 for 1 h before 20 µM sufentanil treatment. (A) The endothelial barrier
  function was detected using in vitro permeability assay. (B) The expression levels
  of endothelial barrier function-related proteins were detected using western blot
  analysis. (C) The level of VE-cadherin was detected using IF. Magnification, x200.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. OGD/R, oxygen and
  glucose deprivation/reoxygenation; HCMECs, human cardiac microvascular endothelial
  cells; IF, immunofluorescence; VE, vascular endothelial.
