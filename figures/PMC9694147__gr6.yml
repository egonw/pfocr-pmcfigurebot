caption: Ascorbic acid produces rapid antidepressant action via activating S100A4-ErbB4-BDNF-TrkB
  signaling pathway. (A) The expression of BDNF protein in the mPFC of CUS mice microinjected
  with AAV-S100A4 or AAV-GFP. (B) The expression of BDNF protein in the mPFC 24 h
  after ascorbic acid (200 mg/kg) administration. (C) Representative confocal images
  and quantification of dendritic spines from neurons in the mPFC 24 h after administration
  with ascorbic acid, scale bar = 5 μm. (D) Experimental timeline of CUS, stereotaxic
  surgery, cannula infusion, drug treatment and behavioral tests. (E) Results of SPT
  and FST immobility time 24 h after ascorbic acid treatment with or without AG1478
  (50 μM, 1 μL per side) pretreatment. (F) Experimental timeline of CUS, stereotaxic
  surgery, cannula infusion, drug treatment and behavioral tests. (G) Results of SPT
  and FST immobility time 24 h after ascorbic acid treatment with, or without, ANA-12
  (2.45 mM, 1 μL per side) pretreatment. All data were represented as mean ± SEM and
  analyzed by Student's t-test (A) or two-way ANOVA (B, C, E, G) with Bonferroni's
  post-hoc test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
