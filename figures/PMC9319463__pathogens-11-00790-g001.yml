caption: Model of PKR antagonism by E3L and TRS1. When dsRNA is produced during viral
  infections, PKR undergoes a conformational change, leading to activation by homodimerization
  and autophosphorylation [,]. VACV E3L can bind to and sequester dsRNA, thereby preventing
  PKR activation [,]. Binding of E3L to dsRNA induces the formation of Z-RNA, which
  can trigger necroptosis. However, the N-terminal domain of E3L binds to this Z-RNA,
  blocking activation of the necroptosis signaling pathway. HCMV TRS1 binds to both
  dsRNA and PKR, possibly forming a heterodimer that prevents PKR activation [,].
  The dsRBDs of each protein are shown in purple.
