caption: Effects of Lys deficiency on the differentiation and Wnt/Ca2+pathway in semimembranosus
  and semitendinosus SCs. Expression of MyHC and differentiation marker proteins (myogenin
  and MRF4) in porcine fast (semimembranosus; a,c) and slow (semitendinosus; b,d)
  muscle SCs after 48 h Lys deficiency. CaN fluorescence intensity in 48 h Lys deficiency-treated
  porcine fast (semimembranosus; e,g) and slow (semitendinosus; f,h) muscles. Expression
  assay of Wnt/Ca2+pathway key proteins (PKC, CaN, CaMKII, and NFATc1) in fast (semimembranosus;
  i,k) and slow (semitendinosus; j,l) muscle SCs after 48 h Lys deficiency. * indicates
  p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001.
