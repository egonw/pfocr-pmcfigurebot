caption: The increase in placental miR21 abundance during early pregnancy induces
  a PE-like phenotype in mice(A) Systolic blood pressure of pregnant mice in the agomir-NC,
  agomir-miR21, and control groups; n = 10, two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test. (B) Plasma s-FLT1 of pregnant mice in the control, agomir-NC, and agomir-miR21
  groups determined by ELISA; n = 10 in each group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test. (C) Urinary albumin assay of pregnant mice; n = 7 in the control
  and agomir-NC groups, n = 8 in the agomir-miR21 group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test. (D) H&E staining of maternal kidneys collected on E13.5
  and E18.5; scale bar, 100 μm. (E) Placental weight; n = 106 placentae from 10 dams
  in the control group, n = 97 placentae from 10 dams in the agomir-NC group, and
  n = 111 placentae from 10 dams in the agomir-miR21 group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test. (F) H&E staining of the placental morphology in the uteroplacental
  units collected at E13.5 and E18.5 from the agomir-NC and agomir-miR21 groups; n =
  3, two-tailed t test, ∗p < 0.05. (G) Fetal weight; n = 106 fetuses from 10 dams
  in the control group, n = 97 fetuses from 10 dams in the agomir-NC group, and n =
  111 fetuses from 10 dams in the agomir-miR21 group, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test. (H) Crown-rump length (CRL) of fetuses; n = 97–111, one-way ANOVA
  and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. (I) Representative images of the fetuses of
  the control, agomir-NC, and agomir-miR21 groups; scale bars, 1 cm. The data are
  presented as the means ± SEMs.
