figure_title: DCC-2036 and AXL regulate the KLF5 protein level through Akt/GSK3β pathway
caption: A DCC-2036 decreased the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), GSK3β (Ser9), and
  total KLF5, and increased the phosphorylation of KLF5 (Ser303). TNBC cells were
  treated with DCC-2036 for 48 h, followed by the WB assay. B Gas6 promoted the increase
  of p-AKT, p-GSK3β, and total KLF5, as well as the decrease of p-KLF5 in MDA-MB-231
  cells and HS-578T cells. Cells were treated with Gas6 (200 ng/ml) for 0, 30, 60,
  90, and 120 min, and then examined by WB.
