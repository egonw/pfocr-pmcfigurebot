caption: 'CRISPRe promotes the synthesis of PQQ by enhancing the expression of downstream
  genes in operon(A) Schematic of the roles of PQQ in K. vulgare. The uncharacterized
  gene (locus: KVU_2026) adjacent to pqqE was named as pqqF. The long intergenic region
  divides the operon to up (pqqA) and downstream (pqqB/pqqC/pqqD/pqqE/pqqF) genes.
  The number of amino acids encoded by each gene is shown. PQQ provides an essential
  redox cofactor for dehydrogenases and is ultimately converted into energy through
  the oxidative pathway in K. vulgare,.(B) The targets and partial sequences in pqq
  operon. Tn represents the iPAM-flanking targets in operon. The sequences of pqqA
  and long intergenic region in operon are indicated. The targeted fragments located
  within pqqA gene body and intergenic sequence are underlined. The iPAM motifs are
  in red box. Termination and initiation codons are marked in black bold. Numbers
  show the distance between the stop and the restart site (in nucleotides). Orange
  marked amino acid residues are the backbone sources of PQQ products., See also .(C–F)
  Gene expression and product synthesis at different time in strains. The transcriptional
  differences between upstream and downstream genes in operon are analyzed and shown
  (C). PQQ synthesis in strains is shown in (D), (E), (F). T1/T2/T3/T4/T1+T3: WT with
  the corresponding crRNAs. WT was the control. Values are means ± s.d, (n = 3 biological
  replicates); ∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001, ∗∗∗∗P＜0.0001. Student’s t test. ns = non-significant.
  See also A–S5C.(G–I) Gene expression and product synthesis in strains carrying crRNA
  (T5/T5+T6). The data analysis was consistent with (C–F).(J) Affinity of seed sequences.(K)
  Correlation between gene expression and product synthesis. The correlation between
  gene expression (relative expression of pqqA in downstream genes) and PQQ synthesis
  in different strains was analyzed under the influence of CRISPRe.'
