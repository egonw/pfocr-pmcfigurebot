caption: Effects of LTP treatment on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin and VEGF-signaling-pathway-associated
  proteins in PC-9 cells. (A) WB bands of Wnt3A, β-Catenin, Cyclin D1, c-Jun, VEGFR2,
  and VEGF proteins. (B) Quantitative analysis of each protein expression level. Data
  represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. “ns” means no statistical
  difference. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 with ANOVA compared with the control.
