caption: The regulation and targets of autophagy and apoptosis. ULK1, Atg13, FIP200,
  and Atg101 are found in a supramolecular complex that cooperates with Atg9 to promote
  autophagosome nucleation. ULK1 favors the autophagic cascade by facilitating a multiprotein
  complex formed by Beclin1, VPS34 (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase catalytic subunit
  type 3), VPS15 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4), and Atg14. A multiprotein
  complex composed of Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16L1 (autophagy-related 16-like 1) promotes
  autophagy activation. Atg3 and Atg4 are ultimately responsible for the cleavage
  of members of the Atg8-family proteins. Caspase-8 activates downstream targets by
  activating caspase-3, caspase-9, Atg3 and Atg4 to activate autophagy and apoptosis.
  Targeted transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a crucial regulator of the autophagyâ€“lysosomal
  pathway.
