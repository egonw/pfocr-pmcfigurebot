caption: 'ROCK1 overexpression in human LSCC tissues and cell lines. A The expression
  levels of ROCK1 mRNA in 30 LSCC were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are shown as 2−∆Ct
  (**P < 0.01). B IHC staining of ROCK1 in LSCC tissues (magnification: ×100). C The
  mRNA expression of ROCK1 in the LSCC cell lines was quantified by qRT-PCR. D The
  protein expression of ROCK1 in human LSCC cell lines was examined by Western Blot.
  E Patients with ROCK1 weak staining had a significantly benign prognosis than those
  with strong staining, P = 0.0067'
