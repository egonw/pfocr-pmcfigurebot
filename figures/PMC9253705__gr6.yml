caption: Pexmetinib suppressed breast cancer cell-induced osteolytic lesions in vivo.
  (A-B) MDA-MB-231 cells were injected directly into the tibiae plateau. After 28 days
  of treatment, all mice were executed. The tissue volume, tissue width and tissue
  length were measured. (C) Three-dimensional reconstructed tibiae images are presented.
  (D) The BV/TV ratio, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp)
  of each sample was measured. (E-F) The tibiae sections were stained with H&E, TRAP
  and p-STAT3 immunohistochemical staining. Scale bar = 200 μm, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data
  are expressed as means ± SEM, n = 5.
