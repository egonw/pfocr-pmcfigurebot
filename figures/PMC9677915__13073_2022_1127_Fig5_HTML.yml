caption: ECM components contribute to signaling pathways associated with prognosis.
  A Top 25 up- and downregulated differentially enriched MSigDb hallmark pathways
  in the ECM-High matreotype compared with the ECM-Low matreotype. Circle size indicates
  the inverse of the −log10(p-value), color reflects the log fold change (logFC) of
  the ECM-High matreotype compared with the ECM-Low matreotype. B Pathway analysis
  of cisplatin-related signatures comparing ECM-High matreotype with the ECM-Low matreotype.
  C Abundance of CHK2 in the ECM-High matreotype (green) compared with the ECM-Low
  matreotype (blue). p=1.5E−4, Mann-Whitney U test. D Comparison of the phosphorylated
  YB1(S102) in the ECM-High matreotype (green) compared with the ECM-Low matreotype
  (blue). p=1.1E−3, Mann-Whitney U test. E Ligand-receptor interaction results of
  differentially expressed core matrisomal genes significantly upregulated in ECM-High
  compared with ECM-Low matreotypes and the receptor groups that they directly interact
  with. Sector width is the aggregated log fold change of the ligand-receptor interaction
  strength comparing the ECM-High to ECM-Low matreotype. The scale indicates the width
  of each link between the ECM category and its cognate receptors. The widths of each
  link are the maximum fold change of the ligand-receptor interaction scores comparing
  the ECM-High and ECM-Low groups for that ligand-receptor interaction. F Hallmark
  pathways regulated by ligand-receptor interactions that are significantly enriched
  in the ECM-High compared with the ECM-Low matreotypes. The scale indicates the width
  of each link between the ECM category and the hallmark pathway. The widths of each
  link are the maximum fold change of the ligand-receptor interaction scores comparing
  the ECM-High and ECM-Low groups for that hallmark pathway
