caption: CXCL1 promotes colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
  a Western Blotting validation of CXCL1 knockout and overexpression efficiency in
  MC38 cells; b qPCR validation of CXCL1 overexpression efficiency in MC38 cells;
  c results of CCK8 assay showing a significant effect of CXCL1 on the proliferation
  of MC38 colon cancer cells. d Results of Transwell assay showing the stimulatory
  effect of CXCL1 on the migration and invasion ability of MC38 cells. e Cell colony
  formation ability assessed by plate clone formation assay. CXCL1 promoted the clonogenic
  ability in MC38 cells. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001
article_title: CXCL1 promotes colon cancer progression through activation of NF-κB/P300
  signaling pathway.
