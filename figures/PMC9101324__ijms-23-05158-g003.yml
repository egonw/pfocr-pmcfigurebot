caption: Functional classes of B-Raf mutations. Class I B-Raf mutants contain V600E/D
  mutations in the activation loop which can signal as active monomers, independent
  of Ras. Class II B-Raf mutants are Ras-independent and signal as dimers. Class III
  B-Raf mutants have reduced kinase activity and drive the activation of ERK signaling
  by transactivating wild-type Raf which signals as mutant B-Rafâ€“wild-type C-Raf dimers.
  These mutants require active Ras to trigger a signaling cascade.
