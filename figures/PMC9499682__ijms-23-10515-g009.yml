caption: The network of key DAMs in GN2 (A) and GN18 (B) seeds induced under salt
  stress in metabolism. The upregulated and downregulated metabolites are indicated
  in red and green colors, respectively. The metabolic pathway is circled with a blue
  dotted border, and the name of the metabolic pathway is written in yellow font.
  The dotted arrows indicate multiple steps between the two metabolites.
