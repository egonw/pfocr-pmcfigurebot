caption: An overview of the impact of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitors on
  the kidney and the insulin signaling pathways. The key aspects of the insulin signaling
  pathway, such as insulin binding, signal cascade, exocytosis, and glucose entry,
  are presented. DPP-IV inhibitors (DPP-IVis) are non-insulin glucose-lowering agents
  that are members of the incretin family. They are able to improve glycemic control
  while maintaining an acceptable level of safety. In individuals with chronic kidney
  disease, these medications are associated with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia, no
  weight gain, and good overall tolerability. The results of clinical trials are still
  up for debate, even though several experimental and clinical research point to the
  possibility that DPP-IVis may exert considerable pleiotropic effects, particularly
  on the kidneys. The figure was created with BioRender.com.

  plants as reformed DPP-IV inhibitors to regulate incretin activity.
