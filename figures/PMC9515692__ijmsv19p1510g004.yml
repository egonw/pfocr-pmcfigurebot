caption: Protein expression levels of EGF, pEGFR, EGFR, TGF-β1, pSmad3, Smad3, collagen
  I and collagen III in LF tissue. The levels of EGF, pEGFR, TGF-β1, pSmad3, collagen
  I and collagen III in the LSCS group were significantly higher than those in Non-LSCS
  group. The level of phosphorylated EGFR represents the degree of EGFR activation.
  When the level of total EGFR is unchanged and the level of phosphorylated EGFR is
  decreased, it indicates that EGFR activation is decreased or inhibited, and vice
  versa. Likewise, the level of phosphorylated Smad3 represents the degree of Smad3
  activity.
