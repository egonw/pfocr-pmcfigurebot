caption: 'Functional network altered by NOX5-β overexpression in hCMEC/D3 cells related
  with cell proliferation and apoptosis (inferred from Ingenuity® software). The network
  contains Cyclins signaling proliferative pathway, including ribosome proteins downregulation.
  Proteins are represented in different subdivisions of the scheme according to their
  cellular location (nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, extracellular space, or
  other). Green: indicates decreased expression measurement. Red: indicates increased
  expression measurement. Blue lines: predicted inhibition. Orange lines: predicted
  activation. Grey/White lines: non-predicted effect. Yellow lines: findings inconsistent
  with the estate of downstream molecule. Color intensity directly associates with
  statistical confidence for orange and blue objects. Potential master regulators
  identified: E2f and Hsp70 (activated) and ribonucleotide reductase (Rnr) (inhibited).'
