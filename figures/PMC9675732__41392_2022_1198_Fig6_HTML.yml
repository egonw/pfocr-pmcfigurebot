caption: PD-L1.BB CSR engagement upregulates T-cell activation, cytotoxicity, and
  proliferation related gene expressions in HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB CAR-T cells. a RNA-seq
  analysis of HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB and HER2.28ζ CAR-T cells at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after
  stimulation with irradiated SKOV3PD-L1 cells, and the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) were shown in volcano plot (FC ≥ 2, Q ≤ 0.05). FDR, false discovery rate;
  FC, fold change. b Significant enriched KEGG pathway terms of DEGs between HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB
  and HER2.28ζ CAR-T cells at 24 h post-stimulation (FC ≥ 2, Q ≤ 0.001). c Heatmap
  of selected DEGs with different expression related to cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction, chemokine and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways. d Analysis
  of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs between HER2.28ζ/PD-L1.BB
  and HER2.28ζ CAR-T cells 24 h after stimulation. e–j Gene-set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) of IFN-γ e, IL-2 f, TNF-α g signaling pathways, as well as mitosis genes
  h, G2M checkpoint genes i and stem cell memory pathway j was performed on all gene
  sets at 24 h post-stimulation. Data shown are representative of 2 replicates
