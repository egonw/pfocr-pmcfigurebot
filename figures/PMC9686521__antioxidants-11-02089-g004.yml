caption: Treatment with the GSH inhibitor butthionine sulfoximine (BSO) reversed the
  ability of narcissoside (NCS) to inhibit 6-OHDA-induced ROS production and expression
  of apoptosis-related proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. BSO (100 μM) or NAC (1 mM) was added
  to SH-SY5Y cells 1 h before NCS pretreatment. Then, cells were incubated with NCS
  (1 μM) for 24 h, followed by treating them with 100 μM 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
  for 12 h. (A) ROS levels were measured using the H2DCFDA method. (B) GSH levels
  were determined by GSH assay kit. (C) The ratio of cleaved caspase 3/pro caspase
  3 and cleaved PARP/pro PARP was determined by western blotting. The expression of
  β-tubulin is internal loading control (left). The intensity of the signal was quantified
  by the ImageJ software. (right).
