caption: 'MDA-MB-231-derived EVs promoted BC cell drug resistance. (a) The survival
  of MCF-7, HCC1937, and BT474 cells in different concentrations of doxorubicin (Dox),
  cisplatin (Cis), and fulvestrant (Ful) was detected using CCK-8 assay. Then, the
  BC cells were treated with 15 μg/mL MDA-MB-231-derived EVs (EV-group) or MDA-MB-231
  supernatant supplemented with GW4869 (NC group), or PBS as a negative control (blank
  group). (c) Fluorescence microscope showed the uptake of EVs (15 μg/mL) labeled
  with the red fluorescent dye PKH26 by MCF-7, BT474, and HCC1937 cells after 24 h
  of stimulation. Next, MDA-MB-231-derived EV-treated parental or drug-resistant BC
  cells were exposed to 0.5 μM doxorubicin, 2.5 μM cisplatin, and 0.5 μM fulvestrant,
  respectively. Then, CCK-8 assay (c), colony formation assay (d), and flow cytometry
  (e) were performed to determine the effect of MDA-MB-231-derived EVs on BC cell
  drug resistance. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation; one-way ANOVA
  and Tukey''s multiple comparison test were used to determine statistical significance.
  ∗p < 0.05 and∗∗p < 0.01. Three independent experiments were performed. BC: breast
  cancer; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8; ANOVA: analysis of variance.'
