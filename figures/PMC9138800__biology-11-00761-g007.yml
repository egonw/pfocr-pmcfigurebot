caption: 'FPKM distribution of the twenty most enriched KEGG pathways. The x-axis
  is the enriched pathway, the y-axis is the FPKM value expressed as log10(FPKM+1)
  (FPKM > 0.3). Red dots represent the ”outlier” clusters. 1: glycolysis; 2: oxidative
  phosphorylation; 3: purine metabolism; 4: pyrimidine metabolism; 5: glyoxylate and
  dicarboxylate metabolism; 6: aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; 7: carbon metabolism;
  8: 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism; 9: fatty acid metabolism; 10: degradation of
  aromatic compounds; 11: biosynthesis of amino acids; 12: ribosome; 13: RNA transport;
  14: spliceosome; 15: proteasome; 16: protein export; 17: ras signaling pathway;
  18: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis; 19: protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum;
  20: plant-pathogen interaction.'
