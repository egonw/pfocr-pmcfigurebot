caption: 'QTF mitigates PERK overexpression-induced cytokine release, ROS production,
  and ER stress in A549 cells. (a) Protein PERK level was detected after transduction
  of PERK overexpressing lentivirus. (b) A549 cells were treated with PERK overexpressing
  lentivirus and/or 10 μM PDTC. ELISA assay was used to detect the TNF-α and IL-8
  release. (c–f) A549 cells were treated with PERK overexpressing lentivirus and/or
  0.2 mg/mL QTF. The TNF-α and IL-8 release (c), NF-Κb activation (d), ROS production
  (e), and the PERK, eIF2α, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP protein levels (f) were measured.
  (g) TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptotic cells. ×200. (H) The caspase 3,
  CHOP, and PERK levels were measured using immunofluorescence. ×200. ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. vector; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. oePERK+vehicle.'
