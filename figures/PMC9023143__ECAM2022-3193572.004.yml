caption: 'The effect of HLJDD on Wnt target genes in psoriatic mice. (a, b) Western
  blot of TCF4, LEF1, cyclin D1, TBX3, EPHB2, and NOTUM protein levels in skin samples
  of psoriasis mice. (c) A comparison of TCF4, LEF1, cyclin D1, TBX3, EPHB2, and NOTUM
  protein expression levels in skin samples of psoriasis mice. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. ∗P <
