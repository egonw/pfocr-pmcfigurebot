caption: Effects of ANP-6 and ANP-7 on mRNA levels of iNOS (A), COX-2 (B), TNF-α (C),
  IL-1β (D), IL-6 (E), IL-10 (F), TNF-α/IL-10 ratio (G), IL-1β/IL-10 ratio (H), IL-6/IL-10
  ratio (I), TLR-2 (J), TLR-4 (K) and the possible signaling pathways of ANP-6 and
  ANP-7 (L). Results were indicated as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Values are significantly
  different from the LPS treated or control group at * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001. ns, not significant.
