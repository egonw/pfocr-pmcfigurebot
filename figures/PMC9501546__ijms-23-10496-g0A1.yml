caption: Promoter methylation of TTYH3 gene is significantly down-regulated in bladder
  cancer tissue. (A) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical data from the UALCAN
  web tool were used to compare promoter methylation of TTYH3 in normal and bladder
  cancer patient tissues. The data were categorized based on individual cancer stages
  (B), patient’s race (C), patient’s gender (D), patient’s age (E), patient’s weight
  (F), smoking status (G), nodal metastasis status (H), histological subtypes (I).
  (*** p ≤ 0.001).
