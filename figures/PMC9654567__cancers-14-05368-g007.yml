caption: 'SUN5 cooperated with Nesprin2 to regulate the ERK pathway. (A) Interaction
  network analysis of SUN5, Nesprin2, and ERK1/2 by the STRING database. (B) Immunofluorescence
  staining results showed the co-localization of SUN5 (red), Nesprin2 (green), and
  ERK1/2 (green) in DLD-1 cells. DAPI was used for nuclear staining (blue). Scale
  bar: 15 μm, 15 μm, and 5 μm from top to bottom. (C) The interaction network of SUN5,
  Nesprin2, and ERK1/2 was validated by Co-IP analysis. (D) Western-blotting assay
  showed that Nesprin2 silencing decreased the level of pERK1/2 in SUN5-OE cells.
  β-tubulin was used as an internal control (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; “ns” indicates
  not significantly different).'
