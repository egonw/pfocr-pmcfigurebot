caption: 'Affymetrix Analysis, Pathway enrichment, comparative ApoE expression and
  PAA immunofluorescence. (A) Gene expression heatmap (top 25 hits, cutout from )
  with hierarchical clustering for PAA vs. popliteal artery based on lowest adjusted
  p-value (all > 0.05: ) (annotations: ). (B) Selected examples of KEGG pathway enrichment
  based on Affymetrix data (NES: normalized score shown in (F), * = p < 0.05). (C)
  RT-qPCR results of ApoE expression in PAA (red) compared to popliteal artery (light
  grey), AAA (dark grey) and (D) PAOD (grey) shown as 2^dCt values against the respective
  housekeeping gene (n = 11 AAA, n = 7 A. pop., n = 7 PAA; n = 6 PAOD, n = 7 PAA;
  mean +/− SEM; unpaired t-test, * p < 0.05). (E) PAA tissue sample (HE; scale bar
  2 mm) and immunofluorescence with APOE (red) and SMA (green)-positive cells co-localization
  (scale bar 100 μm). (F) Exemplary comparative hallmarks pathway enrichment analysis
  of Affymetrix gene expression data and OLink Protein expression data for PAA vs.
  popliteal artery (PA) and PAA vs. AAA (all p-value < 0.0.5) (complete enrichment
  sets shown in ).'
