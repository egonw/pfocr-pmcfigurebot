caption: 'OSF-2 stimulates the Akt/PKB pathway via integrin-dependent PI3-Kinase activation.
  (A,B) β1-integrin, but not α5 integrin is induced by the addition of rOSF-2 (10,
  100 ng/mL). Integrin receptor expression was analyzed by Western blot in HNSCCUM-02T
  cells. Actin served as the loading control. Representative results (n = 2) are shown.
  Densitometric analysis of detected bands is shown in (B). (C) Specific phosphorylation
  of Akt1/PKBα on Ser473 was detected in HNSCCUM-02T cells. Insulin and serum-containing
  medium (+FCS) served as positive, serum deprivation (−FCS), and PI3K-inhibitor (LY294002;
  +FCS) treatment as negative controls for staining. Scale bar, 5 µm. (D) Quantification
  of p-Akt positive cells. At least 200 cells from three separate images were examined,
  visually inspected, and counted as p-Akt positive or negative. Ratio of p-Akt positive
  cells (= #pAkt positive/all counted cells) is shown for indicated treatments. All
  treatments, except PI3K-inhibitor, and +FCS, were performed under serum starvation
  conditions. (E) Akt1/PKBα phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis
  using HNSCCUM-02T cells. Akt1/PKBα phosphorylation was induced by recombinant OSF-2
  (rOSF-2) and conditioned medium under serum-free conditions. OSF-2-induced phosphorylation
  was prevented by PI3K inhibition. Actin served as the loading control. Representative
  results (n = 2) are shown. (F) HNC cancer cell (Fadu) survival was reduced after
  treatment with r-OSF-2 and a PI3K-inhibitor (LY294002). ns: p > 0.05; * p ≤ 0.05.
  The uncropped western blot figures were presented in .'
