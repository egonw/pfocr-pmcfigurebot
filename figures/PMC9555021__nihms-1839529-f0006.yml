caption: Characterization of degradation of the 4Fe-4S cluster in p58C. Pictorial
  representation of multiplex Au chip (top). Two chips were prepared, with one half
  of each chip consisting of well-matched (WM) DNA (dark blue) and the other containing
  DNA with an abasic site (red). Anerobic bulk electrolysis and CV for oxidation an
  electrode modified with well-matched DNA duplexes (blue) and abasic site (abasic
  DNA signal in red) of p58C WT and 6YF (degraded) mutant. All scans were performed
  on 38 Î¼M 4Fe-4S p58C in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl and 75 mM NaCl at pH
  7.2 with a 100-mV/s scan rate for CV.
