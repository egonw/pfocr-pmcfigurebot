caption: Principal metabolic reprogramming pathways after DCs activation. (A) TBK1-IKKε-Akt-HK2
  signaling regulates the short-term (minutes to hours following TLR ligation) metabolic
  regulation in DCs, which undergo rapid metabolic reprogramming. This signaling pathway
  stimulates glycolysis, which in turn supports other metabolic processes, such as
  fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and lipid synthesis, hence facilitating DC activation.
  (B) In the later stage of DCs activation, iNOS-dependent glycolysis was performed.
  TLR ligation triggers PI3K/AKT, and mTOR-HIF1α pathways to promote glycolysis, whereas
  iNOS-NO suppresses OXPHOS. While activated cDCs do not undergo iNOS-dependent glycolysis
  in vivo, autocrine type-I IFN signaling triggers HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic reprogramming
