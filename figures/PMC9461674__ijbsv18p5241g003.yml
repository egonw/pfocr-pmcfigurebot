caption: SPC25 induces the cancer stem-like cell phenotype of HCC cells. (A-B) Spheroid
  formation assay demonstrating the size and number formed by indicated HCC cells
  cultivated in spheroid formation medium for 7 days. (C-D) Transwell assay showing
  the number of HCC cells migrating from the upper chamber to the bottom well during
  24 hours. (E-F) Invasion assay indicating the number of HCC cells migrating from
  the upper chamber, which was coated with Matrigel to the bottom well during 24 hours.
  (G-J) Huh7, Hep3B, and SK-Hep1 cells transfected with the indicated constructs,
  treated with 5-FU (G-H) and cisplatin (I-J) at different concentrations for 24 h;
  cell viability measured using the CCK-8 assay and demonstrated byconcentration-response
  curves. Error bars represent the mean Â± SD. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
