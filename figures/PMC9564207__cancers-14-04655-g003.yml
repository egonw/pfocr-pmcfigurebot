caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of JWA in cancer. (A) Genetic susceptibility: JWA can
  act as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Mutations in the JWA promoter region
  (−76G > C) lead to genomic stability and reduce expression of the oncogene JWA,
  thereby increasing the incidence of cancers (leukaemia, oesophageal cancer, gastric
  cancer) in the population. (B) Angiogenesis: JWA inhibits angiogenesis and subsequent
  metastasis in gastric cancer and melanoma by the specific mechanism that JWA ubiquitinates
  and degrades SP1 expression, thus suppressing the transcription of MMP2 and intergrin
  αvβ3. (C) Tumor metastasis: JWA suppresses metastasis involving multiple signaling
  pathways, including inhibition of receptor-dependent (HER2 and CXCR4) PI3K/AKT activation,
  regulation of microfilament depolymerization and reorganization, and inhibition
  of the EMT process. (D) Chemotherapy resistance: in cisplatin-resistant gastric
  cancer cells, JWA is involved in reversing the chemoresistance process by blocking
  the XRCC1-dependent DNA repair pathway and promoting the DR4 receptor-dependent
  apoptosis pathway. (E) Tumor metabolism: JWA enhances cellular oxidative phosphorylation
  and inhibits the glycolytic process through the AMPK/FOXO3a signaling pathway, thereby
  participating in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. (F) Apoptosis: JWA
  promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation in cancer through the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway and cell cycle arrest.'
