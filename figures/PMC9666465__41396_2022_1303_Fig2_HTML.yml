  Data
caption: a Fraction of COG terms of each coenzyme biosynthesis pathway (rows) present
  in each strain (columns); strains are color-coded by phylum and clustered by percentage
  of pathway present. Black rectangles indicate that the corresponding strain was
  found to be auxotrophic for the coenzyme in this study (Fig.Â ).
