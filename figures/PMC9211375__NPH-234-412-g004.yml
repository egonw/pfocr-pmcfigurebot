caption: CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE‐GATED CHANNEL2 (CNGC2) is implicated in the extracellular
  ATP (eATP)‐induced transcriptional response in Arabidopsis roots. Col‐0, cngc2‐3,
  and cngc2‐3,CNGC2::CNGC2 whole roots were treated with control (sodium chloride)
  buffer (Mock) or 300 µM eATP for 5 min (ATP‐5) or 30 min (ATP‐30). Two housekeeping
  genes, AtUBQ10 and AtTUB4, were used for data normalization. Data are mean ± SE
  from three independent trials with n > 4 biological replicates. (a) Results for
  MITOGEN‐ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (MPK3). (b) Results for WRKY DNA‐BINDING PROTEIN
  40 (WRKY40). (c) Results for CALCIUM‐DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 28 (CPK28). (d) Results
  for METACASPASE 7 (MC7). Significant differences between cngc2‐3 and the other two
  genotypes were found at ATP‐30, and P values are shown. No significant differences
  were observed between Col‐0 and cngc2‐3,CNGC2::CNGC2 at ATP‐30. Asterisks indicate
  the statistical significance relative to the mock treatment (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
  ***, P < 0.001). (e) Summary of possible signalling events at epidermis and cortex.
  DOES NOT RESPOND TO NUCLEOTIDES1 (DORN1/P2K1) and P2K2 (P2) together promote CNGC2
  channel opening to mediate calcium ion (Ca2+) influx, plasma membrane potential
  E m depolarization, and cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) increase. The mechanism
  is unknown, but it could include phosphorylation or direct production of cyclic
  nucleotide monophosphates by cryptic catalytic centres (Al‐Younis et al., ). Extracellular
  ATP could follow the apoplastic pathway to initiate events in cortical cells, potentially
  through the P2 receptor complex and with CNGC4 as a component of Ca2+ influx, E
  m depolarization and [Ca2+]cyt increase. Other stimuli could be transmitted from
  the epidermis to the cortex in a CNGC2‐independent pathway.
