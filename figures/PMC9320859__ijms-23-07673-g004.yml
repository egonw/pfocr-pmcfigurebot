caption: AdoMet-upregulated miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a directly bind to 3′-UTR
  of Notch in CRC and TNBC cells. Alignments of miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a with
  Notch 3′-UTR obtained from miRNA-mRNA integration analysis using the microRNA target
  prediction software TargetScan (A). Schematic diagram of luciferase reporter plasmid
  containing 3′-UTR target sequence of Notch for miRNAs (B). The relative luciferase
  activity was determined using co-transfected CRC HCT-116 and Caco-2 (C) and TNBC
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 (D) cells with miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a mimics and
  the corresponding luciferase reporter plasmid. Each sample was run in triplicate.
  The means were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) plus Bonferroni’s t-test.
  Error bars show mean ± SD.
