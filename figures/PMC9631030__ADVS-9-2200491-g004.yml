caption: Gold nanoparticles provide anti‐tumor activity through an autoregulatory
  feedback loop of IGFBP2/PTEN interaction. A) Identification of GNP‐altered angiogenesis‐related
  proteins in plasma. Typical images of the antibody arrays incubated with plasma
  pool of GNP‐ and vehicle‐treated mice (A upper panel). Lower panel shows the pixel
  density ratio of GNP versus vehicle (n = 3); IGFBP2 and IGFBP3 are highlighted with
  red boxes in both the upper and lower panels. B) Detection of insulin growth factor
  binding protein‐2 (IGFBP2) in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients. IGFBP2 levels
  in plasma from ovarian cancer patients (n = 18; designated OCP1‐OCP18) were measured
  by ELISA. C) Detection of IGFBP2 bound to GNPs via formation of the protein corona.
  Plasma from seven patients (OCP1, OCP3, OCP8, OCP9, OCP13, OCP14, and OCP18) were
  incubated with 50 µg GNPs for 18 h and the protein corona (PC; designated PC‐OCP1,
  PC‐OCP3, PC‐OCP8, PC‐OCP9, PC‐OCP13, PC‐OCP14, and PC‐OCP18) analyzed by immunoblotting
  (upper panel). Ovarian cancer cells (OV90) were cultured overnight in complete media;
  media was then replaced with conditioned media (no FBS media) and 48 h later both
  the conditioned media and cell lysates were incubated with 50 µg GNPs for 18 h and
  the formed PCs (media‐PC and cell lysate‐PC) analyzed by immunoblotting (lower panel).
  D) Suppression of IGFBP2 by GNPs. After 24 h of regular culture, OV90 cells were
  treated with GNPs (25 µg ml−1) in the presence of conditioned media. 48 h later,
  IGFBP2 was determined by western blotting (WB). E) Downregulated IGFBP2 by GNPs
  follows PTEN‐mediated signaling pathway. OV90 cells were treated with GNPs (25 µg
  ml−1) or remained untreated for 48 h and then the expression of mTOR, PTEN, AKT,
  and IGFBP2 in lysates was determined by WB. GAPDH was used as the loading control.
  F) PI‐103 deactivates kinase activities. Ovarian cancer cells (OV90 and OVCAR4)
  were treated with DMSO, GNPs (25 µg ml−1) or PI‐103 at various doses (0.5, 1.0,
  and 5.0 µM). After 48 h, the expression of mTOR and S6K in lysates was determined
  by WB. GAPDH was used as the loading control. G) Dose optimization for cell viability.
  Ovarian cancer cells (OV90 and OVCAR4) were treated with PI‐103 at various doses
  (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 50, 100, and 200 µM), with DMSO, or were not treated (NT). After
  48 h, cell viability was assessed by counting the cells using a hemocytometer. H)
  Assessment of cell growth inhibition by the combined delivery of GNPs and PI‐103.
  Ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR4 and CP20) were either treated with PI‐103 at various
  doses (0.5, 1.0, 5.0 µM) or pretreated with GNPs and then treated with the same
  doses of PI‐103. DMSO and GNPs (25 µg ml−1) served as their corresponding controls.
  After 48 h, cell viability was assessed by counting the cells using a hemocytometer.
