caption: Schematic illustration of the protective effects of FGF6 on cardiomyocytes
  under ischemic conditions. Myocardial infarction would cause the loss of a huge
  number of cardiomyocytes. In this study, we revealed that FGF6 restrains the Hippo
  pathway via ERK, and promotes YAP nuclear translocation then increase cardiomyocytes
  cell cycle re‚Äêentry and cardiac repair
article_title: FGF6 promotes cardiac repair after myocardial infarction by inhibiting
  the Hippo pathway.
