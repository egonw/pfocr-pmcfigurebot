caption: 'Histone H3 antibody reduced the level of ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells induced
  by LPS. (A, B) GPX4 protein level detected by Western blotting. (C) Quantitative
  real‐time PCR for GPX4 mRNA levels. (D, E) Immunofluorescence analysis of GPX4 levels.
  (F–I) ROS, GSH and Fe2+ levels in RAW264.7 cells detected by kits. The cell experiment
  of Western blotting was repeated 3 times and the other experiments were repeated
  6 times. Compared with the normal group, #p < 0.05; compared with the LPS group,
  *p < 0.05.'
