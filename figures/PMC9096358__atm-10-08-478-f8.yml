caption: CB restrained the proliferation of colon cells and the expression of MyD88
  and NF-κB/p65 in vivo. (A) Representative images of the colon tumors’ sections with
  immunohistochemistry staining for Ki-67. Scale bar, 150 µm. (B) Statistical analysis
  of Ki-67-positive cells in the colon. (C) Comparison of the relative expression
  of MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 in the 2 groups by RT-qPCR. (D) MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 expression
  was detected by western blot in the 2 groups. (E) Comparison of the relative expression
  of MyD88 and NF-κB/p65 in the 2 groups. Error bars represent mean ± SD; **P<0.01.
  Ctrl, control group; CB, Clostridium butyricum; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor
  88; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; RT-qPCR, real time quantitative PCR.
article_title: Clostridium butyricum inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer
  and alleviates intestinal inflammation via the myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
