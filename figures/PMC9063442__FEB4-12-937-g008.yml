caption: 'The effect of EGCG on expression of enzymes in the DNL pathway, free fatty
  acid and ATP levels in colorectal cancer cells, HCT116 and HT‐29 cells. Cells were
  incubated with EGCG at an IC50 concentration for 24 h. (A) An immunoblotting assay
  was used to assess the expression of enzymes in the DNL pathway. (B) A histogram
  depicts relative protein expression in comparison to β‐actin. (C) The histogram
  depicts free fatty acid levels and (D) ATP levels compared to the vehicle control.
  Apoptotic assay in (E) HCT116 and (F) HT‐29 cells using annexin V/PI staining in
  EGCG, palmitate (PA) at 100 μm, and a combination of EGCG and PA. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD from at least a triplicate of n = 3. *P < 0.05 and #P < 0.05 compared
  to the control of each cell. All data were analyzed using one‐way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post‐hoc test.'
