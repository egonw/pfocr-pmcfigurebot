caption: 'MDA-B02 breast cancer cells produce CysLT via MGST enzymes in absence of
  LTC4S. (A) The presence of secreted CysLT (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) in the conditioned
  media of MDA-B02 and MDA-B02-Luc cells was analyzed using an ELISA assay. (B) 5-Lipoxygenase
  (5-LOX) and LTC4 synthase (LTC4S) were analyzed in the two MDA-B02 cell lines and
  in their parental MDA-231 cell line using western blotting assays. (C). RT-qPCR
  analysis of the three microsomal glutathione S-transferase enzymes (MGST1/2/3).
  (D) CysLT secreted in the conditioned media of MDA-B02 cells transfected with siRNA
  targeting the leukotriene pathway or MGST1/2/3 were analyzed by ELISA assay. (E)
  MDA-B02 cells treated with the leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK886 or transfected
  with siRNA targeting MGST1/2/3 were stimulated with 40 µM arachidonic acid (AA)
  and 5 µM calcium ionophore A23187 for 30 min before analyzing the secreted CysLT
  using ELISA assay. (ns = not significant; ** p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001;
  vs. NT; one-way ANOVA). Abbreviations: AA = arachidonic acid; CysLT = cysteinyl
  leukotriene; PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cell.'
