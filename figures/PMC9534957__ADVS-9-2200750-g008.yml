caption: 'Cholesterol regulates Fzd5 maturation and stability independent of ubiquitination‐lysosomal
  degradation pathway. A) The mature/immature band distribution of Fzd5 in HEK293T
  or HEK293T Z/R DKO under normal, statin treatment and cholesterol rescue conditions.
  B) The mature/immature band distribution of Fzd5 under the treatment of statin or
  R‐spondin1 in HEK293T cells. C) The mature/immature band distributions of Fzd5 WT,
  K0, I199A, and H204A under normal, statin treatment and cholesterol rescue conditions
  in HEK293T cells. D,E) Pulse‐chase assay of Fzd5 WT (D) and K0 (E) under DMSO or
  statin treatment in HEK293T cells. F,G) The quantification by ImageJ of the upper/lower
  protein and the half‐lives in (D) and (E), respectively. By two‐tailed unpaired
  student''s t‐test analysis. H,I) Pulse‐chase assay of Fzd5 I199A (H) and Fzd7 (I)
  under DMSO or statin treatment. Solid arrow head: mature Fzd; hollowed arrow head:
  immature Fzd. ns: not significant.'
