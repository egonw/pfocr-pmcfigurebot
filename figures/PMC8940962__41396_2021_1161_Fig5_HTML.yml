figure_title: Functional nitrogen gene distribution based on metagenome analysis
caption: 'A Cluster analysis illustrating the similarity of normalized coverages of
  all recovered nitrogen metabolism genes across the uppers 4 layers examined [(Layer
  1 (0–1 mm from surface), Layer 2 (1–2 mm from surface), Layer 3 (2–3 mm from surface),
  Layer 4 (3–4 mm from surface)]. Red lines show non-significant differences, according
  to SIMPROF analysis (p > 0.05). B The bar plots show the genes of the metabolic
  pathways in the nitrogen cycle identified in the mat, according metagenome analysis,
  with relative coverage of each nitrogen cycling gene across depths examined (Fraction
  of Depth Integrated Coverage, FDIC). 355 unique genes were recovered from KEGG’s
  Nitrogen Metabolism pathway: 60 annotated as involved in nitrogen fixation, 15 in
  assimilatory nitrate reduction, 38 in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia
  (DNRA), 52 in hydroxylamine dehydrogenase EC 1.7.2.6, 121 in hydroxylamine reductase,
  69 in denitrification pathway. C Values of Nitrogen-focused Coverage per Million
  (N-CPM). The following enzymes perform nitrogen transformation in the mat: nitrogenase
  molybdenum-iron protein alpha chain (nifD), nitrogenase iron protein NifH, nitrogenase
  molybdenum-iron protein beta chain (nifK), hydroxylamine dehydrogenase EC 1.7.2.6
  (hao), hydroxylamine reductase (hcp), nitrate reductase/nitrite oxidoreductase,
  alpha subunit (narG, narZ, nxrA), nitrate reductase/nitrite oxidoreductase, beta
  subunit (narH, narY, nxrB), nitrate reductase (cytochrome) (napA), nitrate reductase
  (cytochrome), electron transfer subunit (napB), nitrite reductase (NO-forming) /
  hydroxylamine reductase (nirS), nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein beta chain (nirK),
  nitric oxide reductase subunit B (norB), nitric oxide reductase subunit C (norC),
  nitrous-oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrate reductase gamma subunit (narI, narV), cytochrome
  c nitrite reductase small subunit (nrfH), nitrite reductase (cytochrome c-552) (nrfA),
  ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (nirA), ferredoxin-nitrate reductase (narB), MFS transporter,
  NNP family, nitrate/nitrite transporter (NRT, nark, nrtP, nasA). D Nitrogen cycling
  genes recovered in this study and the transformation that they catalyze.'
