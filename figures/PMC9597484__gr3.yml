caption: Attenuation effects of KRG and saponin on TLR4-mediated MUC5AC expression
  against DEP exposure. (A, B) KRG, saponin, and dexamethasone significantly inhibited
  DEP-induced mRNA expression and protein levels of TLR4. (C) KRG and saponin significantly
  inhibited DEP-induced expression of TRIF mRNA, as dexamethasone. (D) Unlike dexamethasone,
  KRG and saponin did not attenuate the Myd88 mRNA expression induced by DEP. Bars
  indicate the means  SD of three independent, triplicate experiments. ∗p < 0.05 versus
  the zero value, †p < 0.05 versus DEP (20 μg/ml). DEP, diesel exhaust particles;
  Dexa, dexamethasone; KRG, Korean Red Ginseng; SD, standard deviation.

  and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation via TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in airway epithelium and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice.
