caption: 'ACT reverses the effect of DSS on the expression of HO-1 and HMGB1 in mice
  colon tissues. (A) The potential binding protein of ACT. (B) Representative western
  blot images of HO-1 and HMGB1 protein expression levels. (C) Effect of ACT on DSS-induced
  reduction of HO-1 protein expression levels. (D) Effect of ACT on the DSS-induced
  protein expression levels of HMGB1. n=6; ***P<0.001 vs. control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. DSS. ACT, acteoside; DSS, dextran sulphate sodium; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; HMGB1,
  high mobility group box 1 protein.'
