caption: Step 4. Chemical reaction catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The
  pyrimidine ring is initially formed as orotate. Then, in the next step (step 5),
  it is attached to ribose phosphate (which is generated in the pentose phosphate
  pathway) and finally converted to the pyrimidine nucleotides that will be used for
  DNA and RNA synthesis.
