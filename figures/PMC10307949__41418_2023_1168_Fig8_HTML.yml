figure_title: Schematic representation of the tumour suppressive role of iASPP in
  PC
caption: 'iASPP is a paradoxical suppressor of tumour initiation in PDAC: although
  iASPP binds to and inhibits previously-identified tumour suppressive p53 and NF-κB/p65
  pathways, iASPP additionally binds to JunD/AP1 and inhibits this inflammatory, oncogenic
  axis. Whilst the NF-κB/p65 pathway has been shown to be tumour suppressive, it is
  possible that its upregulation of the inflammatory response confers a dual and conflicting
  role in contributing to tumour initiation. Mutation of p53 (p53R172H) or deletion
  of iASPP (iASPPΔ8/Δ8) on a KRASG12D background leads to cancer initiation and likely
  does so through a similar pathway, as evidenced by the altered expression of an
  extensively overlapping gene set, comprised primarily of NF-κB and AP1-regulated
  inflammatory genes. The absence of iASPP in addition to p53 mutation leads to an
  acceleration of KRASG12D-driven PDAC onset.'
