caption: Metagenomic function prediction based on KEGG pathway analysis. Extended
  error bar plots of 30 different KEGG pathways through free filtering in patients
  in the EN group and PN group. Error bars showed significant differences in metabolic
  pathways between patients in the EN group and those in the PN group (P< 0.05, Kruskal
  Wallis test). The difference in the relative abundance of KEGG pathways was negative
  in the EN group and positive in the PN group.
