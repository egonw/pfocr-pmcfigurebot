caption: Effects of TMAO on the viability of BMMs. (A) Molecular structure of TMAO.
  (B) The cell viability of BMMs after treatment with different concentrations of
  TMAO for 24, 48, 72, and 120 h was evaluated by CCK-8. The cell viability of BMMs
  decreased significantly at 120 h with 800 μM TMAO treatment; * p < 0.05.
