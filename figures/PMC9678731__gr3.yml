caption: Identifying prognostic clusters and examining differentially methylated pathways
  and features(A) Consensus clustering done on PRIME-filtered SCLC methylated cfDNA
  identified two clusters, A and B.(B) Volcano plot of differentially methylated region
  (DMR) analysis between cluster A and B. The horizontal line corresponds to p-adjusted =
  0.05 and vertical lines correspond to log2 fold-change of +2 and −1. There are 174
  hypermethylated DMRs in cluster A and 9,037 in cluster B.(C) KEGG pathway analysis
  of hypermethylated DMRs in cluster A and cluster B.(D) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
  on cluster A and B identified by consensus clustering (p = 0.013).
