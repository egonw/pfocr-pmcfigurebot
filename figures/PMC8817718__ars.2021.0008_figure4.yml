caption: eATP in sepsis. eATP released from injured or dead cells acts as a DAMP to
  initiate the immune response. eATP can be dephosphorylated into ADP, AMP, and adenosine
  by enzymes. eATP mediates an inflammatory response via the purinergic receptors,
  mainly P2 receptors, to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and produce proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. Extracellular adenosine accumulates via the breakdown
  of ATP. The immune-suppressive effect of adenosine is regulated by adenosine A2
  receptors. A2 adenosine receptors signal predominantly via the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA
  canonical pathway to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory mediators through
  downregulating the NF-ÎºB-dependent pathway. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; eATP, extracellular
  ATP; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing
  3, PKA, protein kinase A. Color images are available online.
