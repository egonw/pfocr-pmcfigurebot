caption: WikiPathway signaling analysis of GPR19-associated proteins. Using protein
  lists assembled from the GEO GPR19 upregulated cohort (proteins used were from the
  common to >3, >4, >5 and >6 sub-lists derived from the primary data list) or the
  GPR19 downregulated cohort (proteins used were from the common to >5, >6, >7 and
  >8 sub-lists derived from the primary data list) were subjected to WikiPathways
  signaling pathway enrichment analysis. For a pathway to be significantly enriched,
  an enrichment probability of <0.05 was required using at least two independent proteins.
  Venn diagrams of the enriched pathways derived from the differing GPR19 upregulated
  (A) or GPR19 downregulated (B) proteins were created. Pathways found in at least
  three out of the four (indicated by an asterisk, *) different initial datasets were
  then used for further analyses of their quantitative and qualitative enrichment
  profiles.
