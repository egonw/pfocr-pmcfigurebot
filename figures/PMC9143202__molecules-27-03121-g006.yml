caption: 'Notch3-mediated mTOR signaling pathway was involved in HG-induced autophagy
  in MDBK cells. MDBK cells are pretreated for 6 h with 10 Î¼M DAPT, and then stimulated
  for another 24 h with 25.5 mM glucose. Western blot, CCK-8 assay, and qRT-PCR were
  used to assess protein expression, cell viability, and gene expression, respectively.
  (A) The protein level of Notch3, mTOR, p-mTOR, LC3-II/I, p62, and Beclin1; (B) The
  cell viability; (C) The mRNA expression level of Notch3, mTOR, LC3B, p62, and Beclin1.
  ** p < 0.01 compared with control group; ##: p < 0.01.'
