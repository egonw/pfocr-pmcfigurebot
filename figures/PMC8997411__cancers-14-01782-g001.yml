caption: Investigation of hedgehog signaling pathway in thyroid cancer-derived cell
  lines. Three papillary thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP, K1, TPC-1) and three anaplastic
  thyroid cancer cell lines (BHT101, CAL62, SW1736) were subjected to western blot
  analysis. (A) Evaluation of the hedgehog signaling pathway. (B) Quantitative analysis
  of GLI1 expression in several thyroid cancer cell lines. ß-actin was used as an
  internal control. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) values from three independent experiments
  are presented. (C) Confirmation of NIS protein expression level in thyroid cancer-derived
  cell lines. ß-actin was used as an internal control. Raw data is presented in .
