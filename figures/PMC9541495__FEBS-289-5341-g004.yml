caption: 'Negative regulation of the p53 pathway by hDMX and hDM2: (A) hDMX (turquoise)
  and hDM2 (green) bind p53 (blue) and subsequently inhibit its transcriptional activity.
  hDM2 also facilitates nuclear export of p53, and as a ubiquitin ligase additionally
  tags p53 for degradation, whilst hDMX accelerates hDM2 mediated ubiquitin ligase
  activity. 14‐3‐3 (orange) interacts with: (i) phosphorylated p53 to stabilize tetramer
  formation, (ii) phosphorylated hDMX leading to its nuclear accumulation and degradation,
  and, possibly modulation of its interaction with hDM2 and (iii) hDM2 to facilitate
  its nuclear export. (B) domain structure of hDM2 and hDMX highlighting phosphosites
  on hDM2 and hDMX investigated in this work: Ser342 and Ser367 in intracellular localization,
  protein degradation and ubiquitination, and additionally Ser367 is associated with
  cell growth and protein stabilization. Ser166 and Ser186 on hDM2 are involved in
  apoptosis, signalling pathway regulation and ubiquitination.'
