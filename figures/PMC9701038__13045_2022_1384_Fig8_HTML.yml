caption: HOGA1 loss promotes pancreatic cancer growth via activating LARP7-CDK1 pathway.
  A Boxplot showing the differential expression of HOGA1 in tumors and NATs (t test).
  B Western blot analysis detecting the expression of HOGA1, LARP7, CDK1, CCNB1, and
  CCNB2, in tumor tissues and tumor-adjacent non-tumor tissues. N = tumor-adjacent
  non-tumor tissue, T = tumor tissue. The right panel shows quantified western blot
  results of the 12 pairs of samples. C Proliferation of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells associated
  with various treatments (n = 4 repeats per group). D Co-immunoprecipitation assay
  showing that exogenous HOGA1 and exogenous LARP1/4/4B/7 interact in the PANC-1 cells.
  E Co-immunoprecipitation assay showing that endogenous HOGA1 and endogenous LARP1/4/4B/7
  interact in the BxPC-3 cells. F, H The expression levels of LARP1/4/4B/7 in PANC-1
  cells with various treatments. I, J The ubiquitination levels of LARP7 in PANC-1
  cells with various treatments. K–N The expression levels of CDK1, CCNB1, and CCNB2,
  in PANC-1 cells with various treatments. O Xenograft tumor image pictures (left)
  and tumor weight (right) of indicated PANC-1 cells subcutaneously injected into
  nude mice. P The systematic diagram summarizing the impact of the HOGA1 expression
  on cell proliferation. ****p < 1.0E−4, ***p < 1.0E−3, **p < 1.0E−2, *p < 0.05, ns > 0.05
