caption: Variability of nucleotides and feedback regulation of the pyrimidine pathway(A)
  Relative concentration of nucleotides in 19 conditions. Metabolite concentrations
  are shown as log2 fold changes that are normalized to the glucose condition with
  the BW25113 strain. Dots show the mean of n = 3 replicates, lines show the SD. Log2
  fold changes > 1 or < −1 are indicated by the color of the respective condition.
  Numbers next to the metabolite show the relative SD(RSD) across 17 conditions (stationary
  phase conditions were not considered). Note that RSD values differ from  because
  the rich medium is considered here.(B) Same as (A) for intermediates in pyrimidine
  nucleotide biosynthesis. The metabolic map shows the pyrimidine pathway and allosteric
  feedback inhibition of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CarAB) by UMP. The metabolic
  bottleneck at orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (PyrE) is present in all conditions
  except the NCM3722 strain, due to a frameshift mutation in MG1655-derived E. coli
  ().See .
