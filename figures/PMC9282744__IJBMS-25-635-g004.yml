caption: SD rats were given 10 µM PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 (LY) by periodontal
  injection and subjected to ligation for 4 weeks. (A) The alveolar bone loss of rats
  in the EP (experimental periodontitis) EP + PBS and EP + LY groups was imaged by
  stereomicroscopy. Scale bars = 1000 μm. (B) Statistical analysis of the alveolar
  bone loss of three groups. (C) The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were detected
  by real-time PCR, and GAPDH was used as a control. (D) Western blotting was used
  to detect the protein expression level of IL-1β relative to GAPDH, and grayscale
  value analysis was performed. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *P<0.05, * * P<0.01, * * *P<0.001, ns = no significant difference
