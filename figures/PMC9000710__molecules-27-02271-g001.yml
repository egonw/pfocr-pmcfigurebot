caption: Key steps in the blood plasma coagulation cascade. The extrinsic pathway
  is activated by the tissue factor, which is abundantly expressed in the subendothelial
  tissue but becomes available to blood plasma proteins after vascular injury. Induction
  of the intrinsic coagulation pathway requires activation of the coagulation factor
  XII and the presence of a high-molecular (HMW) kininogen and prekallikrein. Independently
  on the starting point, both pathways trigger the tenase and prothrombinase enzymatic
  complexes, leading to the generation of the thrombin enzyme. The thrombin-catalyzed
  removal of short peptides from the fibrinogen molecule activates fibrinogen polymerization
  and the formation of fibrin monomers and polymers. This complex cascade of reactions
  results in the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin clot.
