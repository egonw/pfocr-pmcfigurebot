caption: 'Comparison of cell proliferation between the groups. Cell viability of HT22
  cells after hypoxia-reoxygenation was remarkably reduced comparing to that of the
  control-group (P<0.05). Note: Compared with control group, *P<0.05; Compared with
  OGD group, #P<0.05; Compared with Low dose group, ΔP<0.05; Compared with Medium
  dose group, ○P<0.05.'
