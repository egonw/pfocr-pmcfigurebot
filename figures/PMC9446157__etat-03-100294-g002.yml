caption: 'Schematic models for Ca2+ channels mediated Ca2+signaling pathways. (a)
  TRPV2 mediates the secretion of RANKL via the Ca2+-calcineurin-NFATc3 signaling
  pathway in MM cells to activate osteoclast formation; (b) TRPV6 channels are translocated
  to the plasma membrane via the STIM1/Orai1 mediated Ca2+/Annexin I/S100A11 pathway.
  TRPV6 channels activate NFAT and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to promote proliferation,
  apoptosis resistance, and bone metastasis in prostate cancer cells; (c) hypoxia
  results in TRPM7-dependent hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) accumulation which
  activates downstream Annexin I to promote cell migration and invasion in prostate
  cancer cells; (d) TRPM7 channels activate Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling pathways to induce migration and invasion of breast cancer cells;
  (e) TRPV6 channels inhibit osteoclast formation by inhibiting the IGF/phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. HSP90: heat shock protein
  90; IGFBP1: insulin like growth factor binding protein 1; IGF1R: insulin like growth
  factor 1 receptor'
