caption: NCS enhances the expression of miR-200a targeting Keap1 to activate the Nrf2
  antioxidant pathway in 6-OHDA-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. (A) The expression of Nrf2
  and its inhibitory protein Keap1 in the cytoplasm of NCS-treated SH-SY5Y cells was
  observed by Western blotting. B-tubulin is internal loading control (left). The
  intensity of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right). (B) q-PCR
  analysis of mRNA expression levels of Ntr2 and Keap1 in SH-SY5Y cells with NSC treatment.
  (C) qRT–PCR analysis of changes in the level of miR200a in SH-SY5Y cells treated
  with NSC. (D) Using anti-miR200a (miR200a inhibitor) to confirm the role of miR200a
  in the Nrf2 pathway activated by NSCs. Western blotting analyzed the expression
  of cytoplasmic keap1 and Nrf2 after anti-miR200a transfection in NSC-pretreated
  6-OHDA exposed SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of β-tubulin is internal loading control
  (left). The intensity of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right).
  (E) Western blotting analyzed the expression of nuclear Nrf2 after anti-miR200a
  transfection in NSC-pretreated 6-OHDA exposed SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of lamin
  B1 is internal loading control (left). The intensity of the signal was quantified
  by the ImageJ software. (right).
