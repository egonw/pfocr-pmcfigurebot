caption: 'Trajectories for the activity of the MAPK signaling pathway with stochastic
  self-activity. Temporal evolution of protein activities from time step 0 to 60,000.
  In the early stage of the trajectories, each protein from 0 to 25 (dotted rectangle
  range) is depicted as a zoomed-in inset figure. Red: EGFR, green: GRB2, blue: SOS,
  yellow: RAS, violet: RAF, cyan: MEK, black: ERK'
