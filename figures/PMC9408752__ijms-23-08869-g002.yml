caption: Differential gene expression analysis of a DAPT-treated human oral squamous
  cell carcinoma cell line (HSC-4). Cells were treated with DAPT for 24 h (n = 3).
  The differential gene expression was determined using a high throughput RNA sequencing
  analysis. (A) Heatmap of the top 50 differentially expressed genes. (B) The differentially
  expressed genes were analysed to identify related affected pathways using KEGG enrichment
  analysis, Reactome Pathway Database and GO terms (cellular component, molecular
  function, and biological process).
