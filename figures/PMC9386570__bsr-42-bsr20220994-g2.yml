figure_title: UBA3, UBE2M and RBX1 knockdown inhibited the NEDD8 NEDDylation of CULs
  and activated the p53 signaling pathway in MOLM-13 cells
caption: (A) The knockdown efficiency of shRNA was >70% by RT-qPCR. (B and E) After
  transfection of shRNA in MOLM-13 cells, the expression of UBA3, UBE2M and RBX1 proteins
  was reduced. (C) and (F–H) NEDD8 NEDDylation of CUL1-4 was significantly inhibited
  following the knockdown of UBA3, UBE2M and RBX1. The NEDDylation of CUL5 was suppressed
  by the knockdown of UBA3 but up-regulated by the knockdown of UBE2M and RBX1. (D)
  and (I–K) The expression of p21 and p53 significantly increased following UBA3,
  UBE2M and RBX1; ***P<0.001, **P<0.01. An independent sample t-test was adopted to
  compare the means between two groups. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
