figure_title: Nif interacts with both STAT3 and CDK2
caption: A Western blot analysis of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 protein from G1 cell cycle
  arrest pathway after 3 days of treatment. B The binding mode of Nif to CDK2. 3D
  structures showed the binding pockets, coloring from blue (for strong hydrophobic
  regions) to yellow (for poor hydrophobic regions). 2D-interaction pose of Nif illustrating
  hydrogen bonds. C Thermal shift assay showing the effects of Nif on thermal stabilization
  of CDK2 and STAT3 protein in MDA-MB-231 cell lysates. D The complex formation of
  cyclin E and CDK2 was measured by the co-immunoprecipitation assay after 24 h of
  treatment. E Western blot analysis of STAT3, p-STAT3(Tyr705), and CDK2. MDA-MB-231
  cells were pretreated with CQ (20 μM) for 2 h, together with Nif treatment for 72 h.
