caption: Comparison of conserved tyrosine residues and substrate binding site in human
  and yeast p58C. (a), Conserved tyrosine side chains in human p58C (PDBID 5F0Q) are
  colored red. A conserved tryptophan is colored yellow. The substrate binding interface
  is approximated by the curved black line. (b), Conserved tyrosine side chains in
  yeast p58C domain (PDBID 6DI6) are colored red. A conserved tryptophan residue is
  colored yellow. Three additional tyrosine side chains in this region that presumably
  also contribute to electron hopping are colored purple. The substrate binding interface
  is approximated by the curved black line. (c), Superposition of the yeast p58C (red,
  PDBID 6DI6) and human p58C in complex with an RNA/DNA product substrate (protein
  in light grey, RNA/DNA substrate in dark grey; PDBID 5F0Q). These structures are
  highly similar as reflected in the backbone RMSD of 0.88 Ã…. (d), The structure of
  yeast p58C in the same orientation as (c) rendered as an opaque surface colored
  by electrostatic field at the surface with blue for positive charge and red for
  negative charge. The polyanionic RNA/DNA substrate from the 5F0Q structure of human
  p58C fits very well in the highly basic surface of yeast p58C, which closely aligns
  with the substrate binding site in the human structure.
