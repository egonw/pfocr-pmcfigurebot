figure_title: Punt BLT activity is conserved in insects, is robust to mutations, and
  is a dominant basolateral determinant in the wing disc
caption: '(A) Amino acid sequences of the juxtamembrane substitution constructs. The
  backbone protein is indicated with the incorporated BLT region indicated in brackets.
  Punt[Apis] and Wit[Apis] harbor juxtamembrane sequences from the respective honeybee
  Type II receptor ortholog. (B–D) BLT function is conserved in insect Punt proteins.
  A9-Gal4 driving the control UAS-Punt[Punt] protein revealed the absence of staining
  at or apical to the junctions (B). The corresponding sequence from honeybee also
  supported basolateral restriction of the Punt[Apis] protein (C). The corresponding
  Wit sequence substituted for Punt’s failed to provide BLT activity, with the Punt[Wit]
  protein detected in a pattern resembling Wit-GFP (D). See  for 3-color staining
  profiles corresponding to B–D. (E–G) Mutation of the BLT leads to varied apicalization
  depending on the severity of the mutation. Representative staining and signal profiles
  for mutant versions of Punt with increasing number of changed amino acids expressed
  with A9-Gal4 are shown. The Punt-PTE variant generally showed a lack of staining
  in the apical domain (E and E′), similar to WT Punt. Mutation of the insect-conserved
  residues to Alanines (Punt-Conserved-Ala) led to moderate and spatially varied overlap
  with the aPKC apical marker (F and F′). Mutation of the entire 19 amino acids of
  the BLT region (Punt-19-Ala) abolished basolateral enrichment as shown by the overlap
  of Punt staining with Dlg and aPKC (G and G′). (H–J) Moving the Punt BLT to the
  juxtamembrane position of Wit caused basolateral restriction. Flag IF gives a nontrivial
  background signal enriched at the apical membrane (H). The control Wit[Wit] protein
  driven by A9-Gal4 showed enrichment at the apical membrane (I). Wit[Punt] displayed
  primarily basolateral distribution with many apical regions showing staining at
  background levels (J). A Wit-Δ19 construct had similar distribution to Wit, indicating
  that the juxtamembrane region of Wit does not control the apicobasal distribution
  (K). Double prime (′′) images are Fire false-color displays of the anti-Flag channel.
  See  for profiles for images corresponding to H-K. Scale bars: 100 μm for primary
  images; 15 μm for prime and double prime microscope images. BLT, basolateral targeting;
  WT, wild-type.'
