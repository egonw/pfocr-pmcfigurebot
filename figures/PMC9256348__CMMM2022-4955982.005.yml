caption: 'HOTAIR inhibition promoted recovery of spinal cord function in rats with
  SIC by modulating the HMGB1/ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway. (a) ROS staining assay.
  (b) Western blot assay for p65/p-p65 and I-κBα/p-I-κBα protein levels. ∗∗∗P < 0.001,
  compared with the SCII+si-NC group; ###P < 0.001, compared with the SCII+si-HOTAIR
  group; @@@P < 0.001, compared with the SCII+si-HOTAIR+HMGB1 group.'
