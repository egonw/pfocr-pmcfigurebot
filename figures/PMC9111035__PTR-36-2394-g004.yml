caption: Anti‐adipogenesis activity of quercetin. Quercetin exerts a suppressive effect
  on fat accumulation by activating HSL which converts TGs to FFAs. Moreover, it also
  stimulates the expression of UCP1 to increase energy expenditure, an important player
  in the anti‐obesity phenomenon. Furthermore, quercetin also restricts pre‐adipocyte
  differentiation, adipogenesis, and inflammation by inhibiting MAPK mediated signaling
  and its downstream factors like PPARγ and CREB. Quercetin opposes the anti‐apoptotic
  effect of ERK1/2 signaling to promote apoptosis in mature adipocytes and thereby
  displays its anti‐obesity potential. Furthermore, quercetin also increases cholesterol
  efflux from macrophages to prevent foam cell formation via activation of the PPARγ‐ABCA1
  pathway and thereby lowers the risk of atherosclerosis. ABCA1, ATP‐binding cassette
