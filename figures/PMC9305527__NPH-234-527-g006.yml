caption: Nicotiana attenuata 4‐coumarate:CoA ligase (Na4CL1) participates in benzylacetone
  (BA) biosynthesis in N. attenuata flowers. (a, b) Mean (± SD) levels of headspace
  BA and endogenous BA in corollas were measured in Na4CL1‐silenced flowers (mean
  ± SD; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; two‐tailed Student’s t‐test). Green
  fluorescent protein (GFP), plant infected TRV2:GFP (a truncated form), which was
  used as a negative control; VIGS‐4CL1, a Na4CL1‐silenced plant, which was generated
  by virus‐induced gene silencing (VIGS). (c) Kinetic parameters (best‐fit value ±SE)
  of Na4CL1 determined from in vitro enzyme assays of heterologously purified Na4CL1
  protein. Best‐fit catalytic values were calculated by fitting with the Michaelis–Menten
  curve, showing that Na4CL1 can catalyze the formation of Coenzyme A (CoA)‐thioesters
  of t‐cinnamic acid and similar C6–C3 compounds.
