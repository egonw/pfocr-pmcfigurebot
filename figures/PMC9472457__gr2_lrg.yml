caption: Extended SARS-CoV-2–related pathway analysis for evaluation of the impact
  of complete inheritance pattern (purple) and potential modifying gene defects (red)
  within the IFN pathway, IL-1/inflammasome activation, NF-κB activation, and autoinflammatory
  response pathways in a schematic presentation of the epithelial cell of lung alveoli
  or innate immune cells. Asterisk indicates one IEI patient. Hem, Hemizygous; het,
  heterozygous variants; hom, homozygous variants. Details of mutations are shown
  in  and  and .
