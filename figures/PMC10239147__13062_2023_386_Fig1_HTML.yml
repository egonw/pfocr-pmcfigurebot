caption: LINC01003 is upregulated in glioma tissues and cells. A The expression of
  LINC01003 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lower grade glioma (LGG), and normal
  brain tissues from the GEPIA2 database. B Kaplan–Meier curves from the GEPIA2 database
  determined the relevance between LINC01003 expression and overall survival in GBM
  and/or LGG patients. C RT-qPCR was used to detect the relative expression of LINC01003
  in 14 normal brain tissues and 66 glioma tissues. D RT-qPCR was used to detect the
  relative expression of LINC01003 in HEB, U87MG, U251, U373, and T98G cell lines.
  E Real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the relative expression of LINC01003
  in U87MG and U251 cells lines, where the cells were transfected with lncRNA smart
  silencer negative control (NC) and LINC01003 smart silencer siRNA; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001

  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
