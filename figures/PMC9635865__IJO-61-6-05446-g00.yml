caption: Pathogenesis of NSCLC. The pathogenesis of lung cancer is related to smoking,
  indoor radon exposure, air pollution, chronic lung disease and gene mutations, which
  act on airway epithelial cells guided by related signaling pathways. EGFR gene mutation
  is a common mutation in NSCLC, which is one of the most common driver gene mutations
  in NSCLC in East Asian populations. TP53 is a gene that accounts for >50% of the
  mutation frequencies in lung cancer. In the EGFR signaling pathway, multiple proteins
  are associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, the downstream proteins are activated
  and the associated signaling pathways are RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT. NSCLC, non-small
  cell lung cancer; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; CSC, cancer stem cell.
