caption: 'CD16/CD86-positive macrophages expressing WNT2b are increased in intestinal
  tissue from B3 CD patients. LPMCs obtained from surgical resections were stained
  with CD45, CD14, CD64 and WNT2b antibodies and identified by flow cytometry: (a)
  Graph represents the percentage of WNT2b-positive cells within total macrophages
  in intestinal tissue (n ≥ 6 per experimental group); (b) Graphs showing the percentage
  of CD16/WNT2b- and CD86/WNT2b-positive cells or their distribution within total
  macrophages (n ≥ 6 per experimental group); (c) Human MDMs cells were differentiated
  into macrophages in the presence of secretomes from non-IBD or B2/B3 ileal tissue.
  The expression of WNT2b was analysed by RT-PCR (n = 3 per experimental group). In
  all cases, the bars in the graphs represent mean ± SEM, and significant differences
  vs. the non-IBD group are shown by * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 and vs. B2 CD samples
  by # p < 0.05 or ### p < 0.001.'
