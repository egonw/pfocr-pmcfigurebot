figure_title: POU6F1 is downregulated and predicts poor prognosis in LUAD patients
caption: A–C Mining the public dataset (LUAD-TCGA) showing the differential expression
  of POU6F1 in LUAD patients with different status of death (A), stage (B), and metastasis
  (C). D Homogeneity of variance analysis revealing the trend of POU6F1 expression
  in different tumor stages of LUAD patients. E Kaplan–Meier survival curve indicating
  overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of LUAD patients with high
  or low levels of POU6F1 in the GEO dataset (GEO31210). F, G Pooled hazard ratios
  (HRs) based on univariate analysis (F) and multivariate analysis (G) for assessing
  the prognostic value of POU6F1 in LUAD patients. H Western blotting assay showing
  the expression of POU6F1 in human LUAD tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n = 12).
  Relative expression (H right panel) of POU6F1 was normalized to that of β-actin
  using ImageJ software. I Real-time qRT-PCR assay showing the expression of POU6F1
  in LUAD tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n = 19).
article_title: POU6F1 cooperates with RORA to suppress the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma
  by downregulating HIF1A signaling pathway.
