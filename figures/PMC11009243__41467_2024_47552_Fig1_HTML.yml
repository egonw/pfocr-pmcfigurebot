caption: Schematic of two closely spaced microelectrodes that were advanced into the
  STN of patients to record evoked potentials and neuronal activity. Throughout the
  analyses, neural activity was recorded with one microelectrode (REC) during stimulation
  trains from the adjacent microelectrode (STIM). STN subthalamic nucleus, GPe/i globus
  pallidus externus/internus, SNr substantia nigra pars reticulata, Cx cortex.
