figure_title: NcRNAs implicated in regulation of ferroptosis
caption: NcRNAs regulate ferroptosis via modulation of its key players at mRNA and
  protein levels. Ferroptosis agonists (ASCL4, LPCAT3, ALOX, CYP450) and ferroptosis
  antagonists (GPX4, SLC7A11, SLC3A2, FSP1) can be sponged and inhibited by overexpressed
  lncRNAs (pathways 1 and 2), circRNAs (pathways 3 and 4), and miRNAs (pathway 5)
  thus regulating the ferroptosis activity. Created with BioRender.
