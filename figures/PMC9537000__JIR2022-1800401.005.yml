caption: Effect of the conciliatory anti-allergic decoction on the airway inflammation
  in the lungs of asthmatic mice induced by RSV. (a) Representative images of HE staining
  sections of mouse lung tissue to assess the histopathological changes. Bar =100 μm.
  (b) Inflammation scores of HE staining in each group. (c-f) The contents of IL-17,
  IL-6, OVA-specific IgE, and IFN-γ in serum were detected by ELISA. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  compared with the MC group.
