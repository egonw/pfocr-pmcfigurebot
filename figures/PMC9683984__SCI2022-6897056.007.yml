caption: 'After transplantation, the structure of sciatic nerve was observed under
  electron microscope at 28 days. (a) There were more mitochondria in the PMSC group
  than those in the control group and PMSC+LGK974 group (P < 0.05). The myelin sheath
  of the PMSC group was more complete. Black triangles indicate mitochondria, and
  white arrows indicate lesions. (b) Number of mitochondria per axon. Data were mean
  ± SEM. n = 3 independent experiment; ∗PMSC group vs. control group, P < 0.05; #PMSC
  group vs. PMSC+LGK974 group, P < 0.05. The scale bar: 2 μm.'
