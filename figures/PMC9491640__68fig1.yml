caption: 'Therapeutic approaches targeting the nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathway
  in pulmonary hypertension. Riociguat stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
  with a dual mode of action. When sufficient NO is present, riociguat acts in synergy
  with NO, but it can also stimulate sGC directly when NO is absent or scarce. Phosphodiesterase
  (PDE)-5 inhibitors act further downstream in the pathway, preventing degradation
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Thus, their efficacy depends on the presence
  of an intact NO/sGC/cGMP signalling pathway. NOS: NO synthase; GMP: guanosine monophosphate.
