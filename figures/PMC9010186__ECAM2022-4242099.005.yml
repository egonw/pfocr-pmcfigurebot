caption: 'Cell transfection effect and the effect of silencing Nrf2 gene on Nrf2 signaling
  pathway and endothelial cell oxidative damage. (a) The western blot examined protein
  levels of Nrf2. (b)The expression level of Nrf2 mRNA in cells transfected. (c) The
  western blot examined protein levels. (d) The expression level of Nrf2 mRNA, HO-1
  mRNA, and NQO1 mRNA. (e) The cell viability assessment. (f) The level of LDH. (g)
  The level of ET-1. (h) The level of SOD and MDA. The data are denoted as mean ± SD
  (a–d, n = 3; e–h, n = 6). #P < 0.05 indicates a significant difference compared
  with the si-NC group; on the other hand, compared with the si-NC + ISSP group, ∗P
  < 0.05 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference.'
