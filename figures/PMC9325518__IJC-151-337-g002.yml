caption: ncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism in HCC. Regulation of glucose metabolism
  by ncRNAs in HCC cells (Tables  and ). ncRNAs enhance aerobic glycolysis in HCC
  cells by regulating key enzymes and/or signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
  HIF and MYC. The major metabolites are shown in green, the main metabolic enzymes
  are shown in red and the main metabolic pathways are indicated in yellow. 1,3‐BPG,
  1,3‐bisphosphoglyceric acid; ALDOA, aldolase; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  F‐1,6‐P, fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphate; F‐6‐P, fructose‐6‐phosphate; G‐3‐P, glyceraldehyde
  3‐phosphate; G‐6‐P, glucose‐6‐phosphate; G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT, glucose transporter; HK2, hexokinase
  2; IGF‐1R, insulin‐like growth factor receptor‐1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PFK, phosphofructokinase; PKM1/M2, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
