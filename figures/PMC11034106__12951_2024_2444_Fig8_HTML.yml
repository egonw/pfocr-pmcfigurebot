caption: Effect of miR-100-5p on proliferation and inflammation of synovium in vivo
  and in vitro by inhibiting mTOR and downstream signal pathway. (A-C) Expression
  of mTOR in RA-FLS transfected with NC or miR-100-5p mimics and stimulated with TNF-α
  or IL-1β. (D-E) Protein expression of mTOR/p70s6K/4E-BP1 signal pathway by Western
  blot. (F) mTOR expression in knee and ankle joints by IHC. (G) Proposed model explaining
  how cBMDM-sEVs with low miR-100-5p levels promote synovitis via targeting mTOR signaling
article_title: Macrophage-derived mir-100-5p orchestrates synovial proliferation and
  inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis through mTOR signaling.
