caption: SPC25 is upregulated in tumor tissues and is significantly associated with
  poor survival in HCC. (A-D) SPC25 mRNA expression levels in the liver hepatocellular
  carcinoma (LIHC) dataset from the TCGA database (A) and the public GEO liver cancer
  dataset GSE121248. (B) 37 pairs of cancer tissues (C) and adjacent normal liver
  tissues from SYSUCC samples and several HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, Hep3B, Huh7, SK-Hep1,
  and BEL-7402) and human normal hepatocytes (LO2) (D). (E-F) Representative images
  of Western blot analysis conducted on 37 pairs of HCC tumor tissues (T) and adjacent
  normal liver (N) tissues (E), and in several HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, Hep3B, Huh7,
  SK-Hep1, and BEL-7402) and human normal hepatocytes (LO2) (F). (G-H) Representative
  images of the immunocytochemistry staining of adjacent normal liver tissues, tumor
  tissues with low SPC25 expression, and tumor tissues with high SPC25 expression,
  and statistical analysis of the scores based on staining intensity (G) and range
  and statistical analysis of the score based on the staining intensity and range
  (H). (I-K) Expression status of SPC25, classified by histological differentiation
  (I), TNM (J), and HBsAg expression (K). (L-M) Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS (L) and
  PFS (M) on the basis of the SPC25 expression status in 142 HCC patients from the
  SYSUCC cohort. (O-P) Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS (O) and PFS (P) on the basis of
  the SPC25 expression status in 330 HCC patients from the TCGA cohort.
