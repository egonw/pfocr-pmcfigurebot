caption: 'BEZ235 can equally inhibit the cancer stemness in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells.
  Cell viability assay of MTT shows that both HCT-116 and HT-29 cells exhibit a similar
  dose-dependent decrease as BEZ235 dose increases (A). After S7333 treatment, they
  still exhibit the dose-dependent decrease of cell viability though HT-29 cells are
  slightly more sensitive than HCT-116 (B), but there are no statistical differences
  between these two cell lines at any doses. The sphere numbers were remarkably decreased
  after BEZ235 treatment with or without S7333 blocking the K-RasG13D mutation in
  both HCT-116 and HT-29 cells (C,D) . *: p < 0.05; **: p< 0.01.'
