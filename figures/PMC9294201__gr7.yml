caption: Quantitative analysis of the K-acetylome changes in response to SIRT2 overexpression
  in HCC cells.A, differential expression of proteins involved in acetylation regulation
  between HCC tumors and NATs. B, PCA of the identified K-acetylation sites in SIRT2-overexpressing
  cells and NC cells. C, volcano plot showing the K-acetylation sites with differential
  levels between SIRT2-overexpressing cells and NC cells (fold change>1.5, p < 0.05,
  by two-sided Student’s t test). D, reactome pathway enrichment analysis of the 122
  SIRT2-induced downregulated K-acetylation sites that were also decreased in HCC
  tumors. The analysis was conducted by AGOTOOL (https://agotool.org/) using the abundance-corrected
  proteome as the control for statistical analysis (p < 0.05 as cutoff). E, a schematic
  diagram illustrating SIRT2 overexpression-induced downregulation of K-acetylation
  sites on metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle. See also , ,  and
  . HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; NATs, normal adjacent tissues; PCA, principal component
  analysis.
