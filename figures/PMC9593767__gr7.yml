caption: Comparisons of cell-cell communications between sepsis and septic shock(A)
  The number and strength of inferred communication links between sepsis and septic
  shock groups.(B) Circle plot showing differential cell-cell communication networks
  between sepsis and septic shock. The width of edges represents the relative number
  of interactions or interaction strength. Red (or blue) colored edges represent increased
  (or decreased) signaling in the septic shock compared to sepsis.(C) Heatmap showing
  the differential number of interactions or interaction strength in the cell-cell
  communication network between sepsis and septic shock; red color indicates increased
  signaling in the septic shock compared to sepsis. The top-colored bar plot represents
  the sum of the column of values displayed in the heatmap. The right-colored bar
  plot represents the sum of a row of values.(D) Scatter plots showing the dominant
  senders (sources) and receivers (targets) in a 2D space. x-axis and y-axis are respectively
  the total outgoings or incoming communication probability associated with each cell
  group. Dot size is proportional to the number of inferred links (both outgoing and
  incoming) associated with each cell group. Dot colors indicate different cell groups.(E)
  2D visualization of differential outgoing and incoming signaling associated with
  one cell group. Positive values indicate the increase in the septic shock dataset
  whereas negative values indicate the increase in the sepsis dataset.(F) Ranking
  signaling networks based on the information flow. Significant signaling pathways
  were ranked based on differences in the overall information flow within the inferred
  networks between sepsis and septic shock. The top signaling pathways colored red
  are enriched in sepsis, and these colored green were enriched in septic shock.(G)
  2D visualization of the joint manifold learning of signaling networks from sepsis
  and septic shock datasets. Each dot represents the communication network of one
  signaling pathway. Dot size is proportional to the overall communication probability.(H)
  Circle plot showing the inferred GRN signaling network at sepsis and septic shock.
  Edge width represents the communication probability, and the edge colors are consistent
  with the color of the sender cell type.(I) Comparisons of significant interactions
  (Ligand-Receptor pairs) between septic shock and sepsis, which contribute to the
  signaling from CD4+ and CD8+T cells to neutrophil subpopulations. Dot color reflects
  communication probabilities and dot size represents computed p-values. Space means
  the communication probability is zero. p-values are computed from a one-sided permutation
  test.
