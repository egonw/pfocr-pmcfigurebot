caption: 'Effects of the NEAT1/miR-101/VEGF-C pathway on BC cells. A After 24 h, the
  proliferation of the cells with enforced VEGF-C, NEAT1 and miR-101 mimic/inhibitor
  expression was significantly higher than that in the miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group
  both in T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 VEGF-C + miR-101 mimic/inhibitor + NEAT1
  group versus miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group. The proliferation of the cells with enforced
  NEAT1 and miR-101 inhibitor expression was also significantly higher than that in
  the miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group both in T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1
  group versus miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group. B, C The quantitative results of the migration
  and invasion assay showed that the migration and invasion of the cells with enforced
  VEGF-C, NEAT1 and miR-101 mimic/inhibitor expression were significantly higher than
  those in the miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group both in T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01
  VEGF-C + miR-101 mimic/inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group.
  The migration and invasion of the cells with enforced NEAT1 and miR-101 inhibitor
  expression were also significantly higher than those in the miR-101 mimic + NEAT1
  group both in T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus
  miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group. D, E The mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-C were
  all significantly increased in the VEGF-C + miR-101 mimic + NEAT1, miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1
  and VEGF-C + miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 groups (Additional file : Figure S3). **p < 0.01
  VEGF-C + miR-101 mimic + NEAT1, miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 and VEGF-C + miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1
