caption: Effects of DHPA on the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in Aβ(1–42)/Cu2+/AA-induced
  SH-SY5Y cells. (A) Representative Western blot were shown for Keap1, cyto-Nrf2,
  Nucl-Nrf2, Histone H3, HO-1 and NQO1 proteins. Keap1 (B), cyto-Nrf2 (C), Nucl-Nrf2
  (D), HO-1 (E), and NQO1 (F) protein expressions were evaluated by the WB analysis.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to control values.
