figure_title: Overview of genome-wide changes of OCT1 binding in response to PTS
caption: (A) A pie chart depicting the number of changes in OCT1 binding in MCF10CA1a
  breast cancer cells treated with 7μM PTS for 9 days. OCT1 binding was assessed by
  ChIP sequencing. (B) Chromosomal view of OCT1-reduced peaks in response to PTS treatment.
  Each bar represents a single peak that was called using MACS2 peak calling software.
  (C) Chromatin states associated with OCT1-reduced peaks were determined using Broad
  ChromHMM data from human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) available on USCS Genome
  Browser (hg19). Peaks could correspond to active, weak or poised promoters, strong
  or weak enhancers, putative insulators, active or weak transcription, Polycomb-repressed
  regions, heterochromatin or repetitive regions. (D) The 326 genes with OCT1-reduced
  peaks in promoter/enhancer regions upon PTS were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO)
  function (blue color) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  analysis (pink color) using DAVID Knowledgebase. The number of genes in different
  categories is depicted in a chart. (E) OCT1 expression in normal and cancer tissues
  based on microarray data from Oncomine database. Expression is presented as log2-transformed
  median centered per array, and SD-normalized to 1 per array. (F) Schematic of analysis
  of peaks and genes associated with OCT1-reduced and DNMT3B-enriched peaks within
  promoter/enhancer in MCF10CA1a breast cancer cells treated with 7μM PTS for 9 days.
  (G) The 47 genes with DNMT3B enrichment in OCT1-reduced peaks in promoter/enhancer
  in response to PTS were categorized into genes containing promoter peaks only, promoter
  and enhancer peaks, or enhancer peaks only as depicted by the Venn diagram. Selected
  genes with known or potential oncogenic role that are associated with those peaks
  are listed.
