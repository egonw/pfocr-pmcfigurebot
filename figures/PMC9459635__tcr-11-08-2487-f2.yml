caption: Ubenimex inhibits autophagic death in SGC-7901/5-FU cells. (A) Western blotting
  of autophagy associated protein expression in SGC-7901/5-FU cells after treatment
  for 48 h with 0.06 or 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex. GAPDH is shown as a loading control.
  Quantification was performed by a densitometry analysis and normalized to GAPDH
  levels. The bars indicate the means ± SD from the 3 independent experiments (*P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and ****P<0.0001). (B) Immunofluorescence staining of LC3B
  with 0.06 or 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex treatment on SGC-7901/5-FU cells. (C) SGC-7901/5-FU
  cells were treated with 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex for 12 h. Then the cells were collected
  and prepared for electron microscopy analysis. The arrows indicate the appearance
  of autophagosomes (scale bar, 2 µm). Untreated cells were used as control. (D) Quantification
  of the autophagosomes of 3 independent experiments is shown. ***P<0.001 vs. control
  untreated cells. Ube, ubenimex; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; SD, standard deviation.
