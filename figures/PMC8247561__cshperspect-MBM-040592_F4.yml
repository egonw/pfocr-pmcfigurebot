caption: The purine synthesis pathway. The purine ring is built on the ribose sugar
  5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as the base. Purine nucleotides synthesis
  begins with PRPP, which, through a series of reactions, generates the nucleotide,
  inosine 5â€²-monophosphate (IMP). (Adapted from .)
