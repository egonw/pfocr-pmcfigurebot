caption: KEGG and GO enrichment of core-MaxCLK genes. (A) Significantly (P < ) enriched
  top 40 KEGG pathways. The horizontal axis represents the ratio of genes in each
  enriched KEGG pathway and the vertical axis represents significantly enriched pathways.
  (B) Top 10 significantly enriched GO terms in biological processes (BP, P < ), cellular
  components (CC, P < ), and molecular functions (MF, P < ). (C, D) The top 10 terms
  in BP and MF enrichment of 46 genes from type-2 subnetworks.
