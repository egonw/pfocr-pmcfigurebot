caption: 'Biosynthesis of Annullatins D and F: (a) Annullatin biosynthetic gene cluster
  in P. roqueforti. The functions of anuD, anuI, and anuG remain unknown. The anuK
  gene, encoding a hypothetical transcription factor, is discussed below; (b) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for Annullatins D and F in P. roqueforti. Hypothetical intermediates
  are indicated between parentheses. Shunt pathways observed in Aspergillus nidulans
  are included within red boxes. Adapted from [].'
