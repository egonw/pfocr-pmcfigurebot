caption: Oil red O staining results. Representative images of Oil red O stained lipid
  droplets (red) and hematoxylin-stained nuclei (blue) in SW872 adipocytes. There
  is no lipid accumulation in SW872 preadipocytes, while SW872 mature adipocytes have
  a substantial lipid accumulation (the red arrow) in the cytoplasm of the cells and
  have some large lipid vacuoles (the black arrow) in fully differentiated adipocytes.
