caption: 'RNA sequencing reveals upregulation of ID4 in Akt-inhibitor-resistant cells.
  (A) Left: Venn diagram of distribution of differentially expressed genes in resistant
  lines. S1, T47D parental. S2, T47D MK0.2-5. S3, T47D MK5. S4, BT474 parental. S5,
  BT474 MK0.2-2. S6, BT474 GDC1-2. Right: Heatmap displaying genes (142) in which
  expression is changed (logFC > 1 or logFC < −1) across all comparisons; logFC of
  these genes are plotted in the heatmap. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis showing
  the top 10 enrichment pathways in T47D resistant cells. (C) Upregulation of ID4
  in BT474 resistant cells at the mRNA (top) and protein (bottom) levels. Error bars,
  mean ± SEM: *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001 (ANOVA, n = 3). (D). Heatmap showing alteration
  of ID4 pathway gene expression in the indicated BT474 resistant lines as compared
  to parental cells. (E). MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with SMARTpool siRNAs
  of ID4 for 3 days, followed by qRT-PCR. Error bars, mean ± SEM: *, p < 0.05 (Student’s
  t test, n = 3). (F) Bar graphs depicting mRNA expression of stemness-related genes
  in ID4-knockdown cells compared to control cells. Error bars, mean ± SEM: *, p <
  0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 (ANOVA, n = 3).'
