caption: SIRT6 is lowly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. (A) The
  expression of SIRT6 was detected in 68 pairs of PC and paracancerous tissues using
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used
  to evaluate the overall survival time of patients with PC who had low expression
  of SIRT6 (n=34) and high expression of SIRT6 (n=34). (C) The survival rate was determined
  by Kaplan-Meier-plotter online analysis. (D) The expression of SIRT6 in 3 random
  pairs of PC and adjacent tissues was determined by western blot analysis. (E) Expression
  of SIRT6 protein in HPDE cells and PC cell lines (SW1990, PC-2, BxPC-3 and PANC-1)
  was detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. NC group, **P<0.01 vs. normal and
  HPDE cells and *P<0.05 vs. HPDE cells. SIRT6, sirtuin6; PC, pancreatic cancer; HPDE,
  human normal pancreatic epithelial; NC, negative control.
