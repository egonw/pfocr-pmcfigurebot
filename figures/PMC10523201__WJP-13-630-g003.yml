caption: 'Representative protein blots of Wnt2, FZD2, Axin2, GSK3β, and β-catenin
  expression under hydrogen peroxide. A and B: The Western-Blot results showed that
  Wnt2 expression in the hydrogen peroxide group increased compared to that in the
  control group; C: The PCR results showed that Wnt2 expression in the hydrogen peroxide
  group increased compared to that in the control group; D-F: Expression of Wnt2,
  FZD2, Axin2, GSK3β, and β-catenin expression after treating with WIF1 and R-Spondin
  under hydrogen peroxide were similar and further enhanced, respectively, compared
  to that in the groups without hydrogen peroxide; G and H: The PCR results showed
  that GSK3β in the WIF + H2O2 group increased, and the other mRNA expression levels
  remained similar. PCR: Polymerase chain reaction. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001.'
