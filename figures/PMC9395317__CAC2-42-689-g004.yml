caption: 'The complex network in the TME orchestrates EMT. CRC stromal cells such
  as Tregs, TAMs, MDSCs, CAFs, and neutrophils secrete various cytokines and chemokines
  into the surrounding environment. These soluble factors activate diverse signaling
  pathways, including Ras/Raf/ERK, PI3K/AKT, TGF/SMAD, JAK/STAT, Integrin/FAK, and
  Wnt/GSK/β‐catenin. Activation of these signaling pathways induces EMT in CRC cells
  by promoting a transcriptional program that downregulates E‐cadherin and upregulates
  N‐cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, and FSP1. Integrin/FAK signaling pathway activation
  induces cytoskeleton reorganization, a prerequisite for invasion and metastasis.Abbreviations:
  Tregs, regulatory T cells; TAMs, tumor‐associated macrophages; MDSCs, myeloid‐derived
  suppressor cells; CAFs, cancer‐associated fibroblasts; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition; CRC, colorectal cancer; FSP1, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; Ras/Raf/ERK,
  rat sarcoma virus/ rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma/ extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinases; PI3K/AKT, phosphoinositide 3‐kinases/ protein kinase B; TGF/SMAD, transforming
  growth factor/ mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase‐signal
  transducer and activator of transcription'
