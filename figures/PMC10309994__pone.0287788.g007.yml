figure_title: Lansoprazole activates the p38 MAPK/Nrf2/ARE pathway and suppresses
  cisplatin-induced cell death in RL34 cells
caption: Schematic model of the Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective signaling pathway by
  lansoprazole in RL34 cells. Lansoprazole suppresses cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity
  through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, accompanied by induction of antioxidant
  genes such as that encoding HO1. These effects are dependent on the p38 MAPK pathway.

  stress through the p38 MAPK/ARE/Nrf2 pathway.
