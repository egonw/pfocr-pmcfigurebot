caption: IL‐22R and its intracellular signalling. The heterodimeric IL‐22R consists
  of the IL‐22R1 and the IL‐10R2. When IL‐22 is not sequestered by the soluble protein,
  IL‐22BP, it is able to bind the IL‐22 receptor. Upon this binding, intracellular
  signalling is initiated, which starts with the activation of the receptor‐associated
  JAKs and TYKs. Activation of these kinases mediates the phosphorylation of various
  STAT molecules, with STAT3 phosphorylation being the most pronounced. This phosphorylation
  allows STAT3 to form homodimers, which can translocate to the nucleus and regulate
  the transcription of STAT3‐responsive genes. Furthermore, STAT1 and STAT5 molecules
  are also activated. IL‐22R signalling is also seen to activate the MAPK pathways
  involving ERK1/2, JNK and p38, as well as the PI3K‐Akt‐mTOR pathway. Akt, protein
  kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; IL‐10R, IL‐10 receptor; IL‐22BP,
  IL‐22‐binding protein; IL‐22R, IL‐22 receptor; JAK, Janus kinases; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  p38, p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinase; STAT,
  signal transducer of activated T cells; TYK, tyrosine kinases.
