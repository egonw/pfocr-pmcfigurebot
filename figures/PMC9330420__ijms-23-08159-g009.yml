caption: A molecular model of the GmERF113 in the soybean response to drought stress.
  When soybean plants are subjected to drought stress, GmERF113 is rapidly activated
  and transcribed, and then GmERF113 activates the expression of PR10-1 by binding
  to the GCC-box in the PR10-1 promoter, thereby enhancing the drought resistance
  of soybean plants. In addition, GmERF113 promotes the expression of two genes which
  are in the ABA signaling pathway, GmPP2C37 and GmRGLG1, also both GmERF113 and GmPR10
  decrease the expression of an ABA catabolic gene, GmABA8â€²-OH 3, thereby the ABA
  content in the plants can be increased. The increased ABA level further promotes
  the closure of stomata and thus improves the drought tolerance of soybean plants.
