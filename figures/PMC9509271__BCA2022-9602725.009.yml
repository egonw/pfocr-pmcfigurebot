caption: Expression of Caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9 activations in apoptotic cell death
  using flow cytometry in K562 cells. The percentage of cells that expressed proapoptotic
  proteins (Caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9) in K562 cells were detected using BD FACS Calibur
  (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Data are presented as the means ± SD of triplicate experiments.
  ∗P < 0.05 vs. control.
