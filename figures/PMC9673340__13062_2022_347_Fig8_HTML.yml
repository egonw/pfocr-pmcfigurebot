caption: SH3BP5-AS1 contributes to CTBP1 expression and increases tumor malignancy
  via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A–B Transwell and Sphere formation assays were performed
  in BxPC-3 cells after co-transfection with SH3BP5-AS1-shRNA and/or CTBP1 overexpression
  plasmid. C Stem cell-like cell markers Lin28, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2 were detected
  by western blot following the indicated transfections in BxPC-3 cells. D BxPC-3
  cells with indicated transfections were treated with GEM at different concentrations
  for 48 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. E BxPC-3 cells with indicated
  transfections were treated with GEM (1 μM) for 48 h. Cell viability was measured
  by MTT assay at different timepoints. F Correlation analysis of CTBP1 and miRNA-139-5p.
  G The proteins of Wnt/β-catenin pathway were detected by western blot following
  the indicated transfections in BxPC-3 cells. H Proteins of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  were detected by IHC following the indicated transfections in BxPC-3 cells. Data
  are shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
