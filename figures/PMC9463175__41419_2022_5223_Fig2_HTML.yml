figure_title: ZNF276 promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells
caption: A Western blot identifying the ZNF276 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3,
  ZNF276 knockdown in MCF-7 and ZNF276 knockout in UACC-812. B-C. CCK-8 assay measuring
  the effect of ZNF276 overexpression on cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 (B) and
  SK-BR-3 (C) cells. D, E The effect of ZNF276 silencing (D) and knockout (E) on cell
  proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. F Cell proliferation ability of ZNF276
  overexpressing cells was measured by clone formation assay. G Clone formation assay
  measuring the effect of ZNF276 silencing and knockout on cell proliferation. H ZNF276
  overexpression affecting breast cancer tumor formation in the mammary fat pad of
  nude mice. I Measurement of tumor volume of the resected tumors from mice injected
  with ZNF276 overexpressing cells and control cells. J Statistical analysis of tumor
  weight of the resected tumors. K Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and ZNF276
  in the resected tumors. Bar = 40 µm. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
