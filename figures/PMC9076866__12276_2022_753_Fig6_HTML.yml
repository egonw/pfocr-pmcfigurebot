figure_title: Grem1 regulates IVDD by suppressing the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway
caption: 'a, e The protein expression of cleaved Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl2 and aggrecan,
  collagen II, MMP3, and Adamts5 in groups treated with rh-Grem1 (50 ng/mL, 24 h)
  or TGF-β1. b–d, f–i ImageJ or Image Lab software was used to determine the band
  intensities, which were normalized to β-actin. j, k Representative images of flow
  cytometry and TUNEL staining (magnification: ×400) are shown in groups after the
  different treatments. l, m Quantitative analysis was performed. The data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3); *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.'
