caption: Tumor-expressed FVII-dependent expression of prometastatic genes. (A) Based
  on microarray analysis of MDApcDNA and MDAFVII cells (n = 4), upstream pathways
  were predicted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. (B) Activity of the canonical TGF-β
  pathway in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII cells as measured using a construct containing a
  SMAD3/4-controlled luciferase insert (CAGA-Luc; n = 3). (C) Pathways and processes
  as predicted with Enrichr. (D) Activity of the Wnt pathway in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII
  cells as measured using a construct containing a β-catenin–controlled luciferase
  insert (Bat-Luc; n = 3). (E) Expression of Wnt pathway constituents Axin2 and LEF1
  as measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in wild-type MDA-MB-231
  cells (n = 3). (F) Expression of Wnt pathway constituents as measured using qPCR
  in MDA-MB-453 after shRNA approaches or FVII antibody blockade (n = 5). (G) Expression
  of Wnt pathway constituents in MDA-MB-468 after FVII antibody blockade (n = 5).
  (H) Western blot analysis of Slug, Sox9, and vimentin in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII cells.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. (I) mRNA expression of EMT factors and Sox9
  in MDApcDNA and MDAFVII, as determined using qPCR (n = 4). (J) Expression of Slug
  and Sox9 in MDA-MB-453 after shRNA or antibody treatment (n = 5). (K) Expression
  of Snail and Sox9 in MDA-MB-468 after FVII antibody treatment (n = 5). All graphs
  show the mean and SD. Statistically significant differences were tested using t
  tests. Con, control; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-1, interleukin 1; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor.
