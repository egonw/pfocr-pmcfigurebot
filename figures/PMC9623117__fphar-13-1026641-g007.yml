caption: PRP played a protective role through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (A)
  and (B) The protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR in heart tissues (n =
  4). (C,D) The protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR in NRCMs (n = 4). (E)
  and (F) The protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, and PTGS2 in NRCMs after being treated
  with AKTi (n = 4). (G) and (H) The protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, and PTGS2 in NRCMs
  after being treated with Rapamycin (n = 4). (I) The mRNA expression levels of IL-6,
  IL-1β, TNF-α and PTGS2 in NRCMs treated with AKTi and Rapamycin (n = 3). * indicates
  p < 0.05. ** indicates p < 0.01. *** indicates p < 0.001. ns indicates p > 0.05.
