caption: Expression levels for YAP (total and phospho forms), TEADs and classic YAP-TEAD
  target genes in cystic theca cells. Theca cells were isolated from ovarian follicular
  cysts and from non-cystic large control follicles. Total and phospho-YAP (pYAP;
  Ser 127) and Pan-TEAD protein levels (A) were measured by Western blot (WB) and
  normalized to β-actin (n = 4 for each group). Relative messenger RNA abundance (B)
  was measured by real-time qPCR and normalized to the geometric mean of three housekeeping
  genes H2AFZ, GAPDH and RLP19 (n = 4 for each group). Data represent the group mean
  ± SEM. An asterisk (*) indicates difference between groups (p < 0.05).
