caption: Pathway enrichment analysis in DEGs in colorectal cancer samples. The top
  12 enriched pathways are listed with their PANTHER accessions (Thomas et al., ).
  The most enriched pathway was the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathway comprising
  5.1%, followed by the Wnt pathway comprising 5% of all the DEGs. DEG, differentially
  expressed gene.
