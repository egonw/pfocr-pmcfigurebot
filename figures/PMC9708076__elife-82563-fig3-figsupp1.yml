figure_title: Conserved and divergent roles of the Regulator of Ace2 and Morphogenesis
  (RAM) pathway in ascomycete Candida albicans and basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans
caption: (A) The colony and cellular morphology of C. albicans WT strain SN250 and
  the homozygous cbk1ΔΔ mutant grown on RPMI. (B) The cellular morphology of C. neoformans
  WT H99 and RAM pathway mutants cultured in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium.
  (C) C. neoformans and C. albicans WT and RAM pathway mutants were serially diluted,
  spotted onto YPD medium, and incubated for 2 days at the indicated condition. The
  C. neoformans data in this figure were taken from .
