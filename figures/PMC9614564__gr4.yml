caption: 'TRIM47 promoted cell proliferation and invasion by activating the STAT3
  signaling pathway. (A) SKOV3 cells were transfected with TRIM47 plasmids, as well
  as co-transfected with TRIM47 plasmids and siRNA against STAT3 (TRIM47+siSTAT3),
  respectively, and western blotting was used to determine TRIM47 and STAT3 levels.
  (B) CCK-8 assay for the transfected SKOV3 cells. (C) Transwell® migration assay
  for the marked cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Transwell® invasion assay for the denoted
  cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. ⁎⁎p < 0.01.'
