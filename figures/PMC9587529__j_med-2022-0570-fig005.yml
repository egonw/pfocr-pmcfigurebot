caption: si-CPSF7 was effective in A549 cells. (a) RT-qPCR was used to detect the
  mRNA expression of CPSF7. (b) Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression
  of CPSF7. (c) Cell viability detected by CCK-8. (d) Colony number was detected by
  colony formation assay. (e) Cell migration rate was detected by wound healing assay
  (scale bar = 50 µm). (f) Invasion rate was detected by Transwell assay (scale bar
  = 50 µm). A549 cells were stably transfected with si-CPSF7-1 or si-CPSF7-2. Each
  experiment was repeated 3 times (n = 3). **P < 0.01 vs si-NC.
article_title: Silencing of CPSF7 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of lung adenocarcinoma cells by blocking the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
