caption: tRNA and tRF biogenesis pathway and silencing mechanisms in eukaryotes. tRNAs
  and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are produced through this pathway in eukaryotes.
  Arrows indicate each step and help visualize how mRNA transcripts are targeted for
  translational repression or degradation, as well as how they influence stress response.
  There are differences in cellular ribonucleases used for cleavage in bacteria and
  yeast that are not shown. RNA POL III, RNA Polymerase III; TSEN Complex, tRNA Splicing
  Endonuclease Complex; AGO1-4, Argonaute 1â€“4; XPO5, Exportin-5; RanGTP, GTP-bound
  Ras-related nuclear protein; Nsun2, NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member
  2; Dnmt2, DNA methyltransferase 2; NPC, Nuclear Pore Complex; ARS, aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase; ANG, Angiogenin; Mt-DNA, Mitochondrial DNA; RISC, RNA-induced silencing
  complex; eIF4A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A; eIF4G, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4G. Figure created with BioRender.com.
