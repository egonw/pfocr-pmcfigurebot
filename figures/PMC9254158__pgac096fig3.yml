caption: 'Compartmental model diagram for disease transmission with compartments denoted
  by susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), seroconverted recovered (R+), fomite/low-risk
  transmission (L), 1-dose vaccination (V1), and 2-dose vaccination (V2). Arrows indicate
  the pathway of transmission. Parameters used for disease dynamic estimation with
  descriptions in TableÂ  are labeled above each corresponding arrow. (a) Model 1:
  deterministic compartmental model for direct and indirect transmission, waning immunity,
  and seroconversion. (b) Model 2: deterministic compartmental model for direct and
  indirect transmission, waning immunity, seroconversion, and vaccination. The force
