caption: Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for patients with recurrent
  implantation failure (RIF). a Venn diagram indicating the intersected target genes
  identified by RNA-seq analysis of decidualization process (SRP224679) and RIF endometria
  (SRP224538). Log2FC > 1 and P value < 0.05 values were considered to determine the
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs). b and c KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO)
  enrichment analysis of DEGs. d The DEGs related to the altered KEGG pathways
article_title: Downregulated INHBB in endometrial tissue of recurrent implantation
  failure patients impeded decidualization through the ADCY1/cAMP signalling pathway.
