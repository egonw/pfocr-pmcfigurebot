caption: Schematic representation of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway. TGFB exerts its
  action by forming dimers that bind to two copies of type II receptors (TGFBR-II)
  and two copies of type I receptors (TGFBR-I). Upon binding, TGFBR-I receptors are
  phosphorylated and activated by TGFBR-II receptors. The activated TGFBR-I receptors
  then phosphorylate the cytoplasmic transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3, which
  combine with Smad4 to form a trimer. This resultant complex translocates to the
  nucleus and regulates target gene expression.
