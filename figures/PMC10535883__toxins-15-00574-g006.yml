caption: MC-LR promoted MAPK signaling pathway and mitophagy in mice gastric tissue.
  (A) Protein levels of RAF, p-RAF, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, Pink1, Parkin, P62, LC3, and
  β-actin; (B) p-RAF protein; (C) p-ERK1/2 protein; (D) Pink1 protein; (E) Parkin
  protein; (F) P62 protein; and (G) LC3-II protein. Data are presented as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). * indicates significant difference between two groups (p < 0.05).
