figure_title: ALDH1L2 is a radiosensitive gene in vitro and in vivo
caption: a Evaluation of protein expression by western blotting in seven colorectal
  cancer cell lines. β-actin served as a loading control. b Different ALDH1L2 transcript
  levels of seven CRC cells. c QRT-PCR for ALDH1L2 in HCT-15 and HCT 116 cell line
  after transfected with knockdown lentivirus. d QRT-PCR for ALDH1L2 in SW480 and
  HT-29 cell line after transfected with overexpression lentivirus. e Colony formation
  assay on different cell lines and its negative control. The survival curves of multi-target
  single-hit model on f HCT 116 cell lines and g SW480 cell lines. h, i Comet assay
  on different cell lines and its negative control. j Growth of tumour volume, k image
  and l weight of tumours harvested in nude mice injected with ALDH1L2-knockdown cell
  lines and its control, with/without 6 Gy irradiation. m Growth of tumour volume,
  n image and o weight of tumours harvested in nude mice injected with ALDH1L2 overexpressed
  cell lines and its control, with/without 12 Gy irradiation. p Immunofluorescence
  staining of Ki-67 in tumours from HCT 116 cell lines with ALDH1L2 knockdown and
  SW480 cell lines with ALDH1L2 overexpressed and their negative control, with irradiation
  or not. q Bar chart demonstrating the Ki-67 expression of HCT 116 cell lines. r
  Bar chart demonstrating the Ki-67 expression of the SW480 cell lines. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
