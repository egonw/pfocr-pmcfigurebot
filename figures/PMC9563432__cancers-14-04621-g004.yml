caption: Mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance. There are four generally accepted
  mechanisms of PARPi resistance. (i) Homologous Recombination (HRR) restoration.
  The synthetic lethality is based on HRR deficiency and PARP inhibition. When HR
  reactivates in cancer cells for reasons including the occurrence of a reversion
  mutation, DNA damage can be repaired by the HRR pathway, cancer cells survive and
  become resistant to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). (ii) Stabilisation of the replication
  fork. Some HRR-associated proteins also function to stabilise stalled DNA replication
  forks. In HRR deficient cells (sensitive to PARPi), stalled replication forks will
  be degraded by DNA nucleases (e.g., MRE11, MUS81). PARPi resistant cells protect
  the replication fork by inhibiting the recruitment of DNA nucleases, therefore maintaining
  genomic stability. (iii) A PARP mutation can affect the ability of PARPi to bind
  PARP, leading to a decrease in PARP trapping. Mutated PARP can recruit other DNA
  repair proteins to correct single-strand breaks, leading to PARPi resistance and
  cell survival. (iv) Increase in drug efflux. Some PARPis (e.g., olaparib) are substrates
  of the transmembrane glycoprotein MDR1 (multi-drug resistance protein 1), also known
  as p-glycoprotein 1. By upregulating the activities of MDR1, PARPi is transported
  out of the cancer cells. Created with Biorender.com.
