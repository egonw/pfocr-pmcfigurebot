caption: Summary and logic flowchart of the study. Silibinin treatment significantly
  reduced the expressions of collagen I and III in normal human dermal fibroblasts
  and keloid-derived fibroblasts, with suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway (highlighted
  in the yellow box). The relationship between mTOR, collagen synthesis, and keloid
  is described in the introduction and discussion sections of the manuscript.
