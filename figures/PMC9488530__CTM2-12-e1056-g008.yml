caption: Scheme of the novel metabolic pathway where S1P lyase (SPL) plays a leading
  role. SPL supports cancer progression as a ligand production through irreversibly
  degrading S1P and leading to LPI, lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) production, strengthening
  mitochondria function or activating p38 through GPR55, and also inhibiting autophagy
  which might supply energy required for cancer progression
article_title: Sphingosine 1‐phosphate lyase facilitates cancer progression through
  converting sphingolipids to glycerophospholipids.
