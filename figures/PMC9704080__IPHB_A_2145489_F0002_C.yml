caption: Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of 13-acetoxysarcocrasside in HA22T and HepG2
  cells. (A) The survival of HA22T and HepG2 cells was found to be inhibited after
  treatment with 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide at final concentrations of 1–5 μM for 24 h,
  with Mock conditions as the control. (B) Morphological analysis of HA22T and HepG2
  cells. HA22T and HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide
  (1, 2, and 4 μM), with Mock conditions used as the control. The morphological changes
  were observed under an inverted light microscope. Images were obtained at 100× magnification.
