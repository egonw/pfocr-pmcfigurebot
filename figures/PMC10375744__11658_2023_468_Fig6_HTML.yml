caption: OA-RD17 promoted keratinocyte proliferation and migration via MAPK signaling
  pathway activation by TLR4. A Representative image of molecular docking of OA-RD17
  with TLR4. B Representative images of immunofluorescence for co-localization of
  TLR4 and OA-RD17 in keratinocytes after treatment with FITC-labeled OA-RD17 for
  1 h; green fluorescence for FITC-labeled OA-RD17, red fluorescence for TLR4, and
  DAPI blue for nuclei; the white arrows indicated the binding of TLR4 and OA-RD17;
  scale bar 50 µm. C Changes in pro-proliferative activity of OA-RD17 on keratinocytes
  24 h after TLR4 inhibition. D Representative images of the effects of OA-RD17 on
  keratinocyte scratch healing after TLR4 inhibitor treatment. E Quantification of
  pro-keratinocyte scratch repair by OA-RD17 after TLR4 inhibition. F Western blot
  analysis of MAPK signaling pathway activation in OA-RD17-treated keratinocytes 24 h
  after TLR4 inhibition. G–I Quantification of OA-RD17-activated MAPK signaling pathway
  (P38, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation) in keratinocytes. All data are expressed as
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments, ns, no significance, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
