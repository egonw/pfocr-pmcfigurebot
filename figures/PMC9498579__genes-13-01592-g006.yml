caption: 'Expression analysis of genes involved in catechin and gallic acid biosynthesis.
  (A) A simplified representation of the catechin and gallic acid biosynthetic pathway.
  The expression values for each enzyme gene are indicated in color on the log10(FPKM
  + 1) scale for three tissues: roots, stems, and leaves. The deeper color means a
  higher (red) or lower (blue) expression level for certain genes. (B–D) Expression
  of DEGs in catechin and gallic acid biosynthetic pathways. The FPKM value of each
  DEG was log-transformed and normalized. Genes marked in red represent up-regulated
  DEGs and genes marked in blue indicate the down-regulated DEGs. LAR: leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; UGGT: 1-O-galloyl-β-D- glucosyltransferase; ECGT: O-gallate acyltransferase;
  CHS: chalcone synthase; CHI: chalcone isomerase; HCT: hydroxycinnamoyl transferase;
  C3′H: p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; F3H: flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H: flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H: flavanoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; PAL: phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase. (B–D) represent the Ro_R vs. Ro_L, Ro_R vs. Ro_S, and Ro_S vs. Ro_L,
  respectively.'
