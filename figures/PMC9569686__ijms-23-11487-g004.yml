caption: 'Western blot analysis of TGF-β1 receptors and SMAD proteins in the heart
  tissues of control and drug-treated male Npr1 gene-ablated mice: representative
  Western blots showing the protein expression of TGF-β1RI and TGF-β1RII (panels (A,B)).
  The densitometry analysis of proteins was normalized to β-actin expression (panels
  (C,D)). Representative Western blots showing the protein levels of pSMAD-2 and pSMAD-3
  (panels (E,F)). Densitometry analysis of pSMAD-2 and pSMAD-3 proteins was normalized
  to β-actin (panels (G,H)). Values are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 6 animals in
  each group). Statistical significance is expressed as ### p < 0.001, vehicle-treated
  0-copy and 1-copy vs. 2-copy; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, vehicle-treated 0-copy,1-copy
  and 2 copy vs. drug-treated same gene copy number.'
