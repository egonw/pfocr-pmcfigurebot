caption: mRNA expression of LTBP2 is correlated with the level of CD4+ T cells. (A)
  Violin plot displayed the fraction of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in primary
  PCa and BCR PCa in the GEO-merged dataset. (B) Lollipop chart revealed the correlation
  coefficient between LTBP2 expression and immune-infiltrating cells in the GEO-merged
  dataset. (C and D) The correlation scatter plot revealed that LTBP2 expression was
  (C) significantly positively correlated with T-cell CD4 memory resting, but (D)
  significantly negatively correlated with T-cell follicular helper in the GEO-merged
  dataset. (E) Correlation scatter plots showed a significant positive correlation
  between LTBP2 and CD4 T-cell expression validated in TCGA-PRAD dataset. (F and G)
  Boxplots revealed significant differences in LTBP2 expression between (F) different
  anti-PD-1 clinical response subgroups in the GSE78220 cohort and (G) other anti-PD-L1
  clinical response groups in the IMvigor210 cohort. LTBP2, latent transforming growth
  factor Î²-binding protein 2; PCa, prostate cancer; BCR, biochemical recurrence; GEO,
  Gene Expression Omnibus; TCGA, The Cancer Genome ATLAS; PRAD, prostate adenocarcinoma;
  PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1.
