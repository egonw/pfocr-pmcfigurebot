caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of diOH-FAs in seeds of O. violaceus.Oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine
  (oleoyl-PC) is hydroxylated by OvFAD2-2, and the resulting ricioleoyl-PC is desaturated
  by OvFAD3-1 or hydrolyzed directly. The free hydroxy acyl-CoA is elongated by OvFAE1-1.
  The elongated 3-keto-14-hydroxy-20:1Δ11-CoA (3-keto-14-hydroxy-20:2Δ11,14-CoA, not
  shown) is reduced to 3,14-dihydroxy-20:1Δ11-CoA (3,14-dihydroxy-20:2Δ11,14-CoA,
  not shown). The intermediates are elongated again by OvFAE1-1 rather than dehydrated
  by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase. diOH-FA is generated by the discontinuous biosynthesis
  pathway. Non-hydroxylated fatty acids are assembled on the glycerol backbone. OvDGAT1-related
  enzymes transfer the dihydroxy acyl chain to the sn-3 position of DAG. We propose
  that OvDGAT1-related enzymes will continue to transfer acyl chains to the Δ18 hydroxy
  group of dihydroxy acyl on the sn-3 of TAG. The final polyestolides can contain
  one to three extra acyl chains (normal acyl chains or dihydroxy acyl chains). The
  assembled polyestolides are then stored in the oil body. Red labels, key genes related
  to diOH-FA metabolism. Pathway modified from  and .
