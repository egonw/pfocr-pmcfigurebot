caption: Steady-state of our model as a function of the monomer production rate, αm.
  (A) Steady-state concentrations of the different species. (B) Activity of the signalling
  pathway for increasing αm. The vertical dashed line in both plots represents the
  location of the transcritical bifurcation described in . Parameters used in A are
  those given in . All parameters and variables are in arbitrary unit.
