caption: METTL3 and IFIT2 are associated with prognostic immune infiltration (A).
  Pancancer analysis of METTL3 and IFIT2 expression across cancers from TCGA. (B).
  The expression profiles that correspond to the distributions of prognostic signature-based
  risk scores. Low-risk patients are represented by green dots, while high-risk patients
  are represented by red dots. (C). The ROC curve for evaluating the prediction efficiency
  of the prognostic signature. (D). Correlation of IFIT2 gene expression and pathway
  enrichment in TCGA esophageal cancer samples by GSEA enrichment analysis. (E). Correlation
  of IFIT2 and METTL3 expression levels with immune infiltration of B cells, CD4 T
  cells, CD8 T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in ESCC. (F).
  A heatmap of the correlation between METTL3, IFIT2 and immune score.
