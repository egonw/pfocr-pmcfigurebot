caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs and DAMs that were enriched in the same
  pathway. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs and DAMs in the 45 vs. 44 group.
  (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs and DAMs in the 65 vs. 66 group. (C) KEGG
  enrichment analysis of the DEGs and DAMs in the 45 vs. 65 group. The abscissa represents
  the metabolic pathway, the red bars represent the enriched differential genes, and
  the blue bars represent the enriched differential metabolites (as expressed by log
  (p-value)). The higher the ordinate, the stronger the enrichment degree.
