caption: Differential expression of mRNA (Log2 fold difference from placebo) grouped
  according to biological pathway. A Adipose tissue inflammation. B Systemic inflammation,
  and C chronic disease. The prebiotic + probiotic supplement (PreticX® Xylooligosaccharide;
  0.8 g/day; AIDP; City of Industry, CA, USA; MegaDuo® Bacillus subtilis HU58 and
  Bacillus coagulans SC-208; 3 billion CFU/day; Microbiome Labs, LLC; Phoenix, AZ,
  USA) was compared to a placebo (rice flour) group. A random, double-blind approach
  was used to assign participants to each condition. The dotted horizontal line represents
  no change relative to placebo at a given timepoint. Values above the dotted horizontal
  line are an increase in differential expression relative to placebo, and values
  below the dotted horizontal line represent a decrease in differential expression
  relative to placebo. The size of each spot is proportional to the Log2 change in
  differential mRNA expression from placebo
article_title: Prebiotic/probiotic supplementation resulted in reduced visceral fat
  and mRNA expression associated with adipose tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation,
  and chronic disease risk.
