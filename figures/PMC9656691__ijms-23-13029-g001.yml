caption: 'Schematic overview of the workflow. (A) FFPE tissue from PCa BM patients.
  (B) High quantity and quality of mRNA extracted from FFPE. (C) Fully-automated gene
  expression assay utilizing nCounter™ digital analyzer followed by nSolver™ NanoString
  technology v4.0. (D) Data output obtained from nSolver™ analyzer software. (E) Manual
  annotation and data enrichment procedure of DEGs: (I) Metascape for molecular function
  enrichment (metascape.org), (II) PANTHER for biological processes enrichment (pantherdb.org),
  (III) protein family using Pfam database (pfam.xfam.org), (IV) pathway enrichment
  retrieved from KEGG (genome.jp/keg), and (V) extracting publication for each gene
  by using related keywords (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). (F) The MACNP stands for Manually
  Annotated and Curated Nanostring-data Platform for 116 DEGs (PCa BM vs. primary
  PCa). (G,H) Further enrichment and clustering DEGs based on the interaction between
  MACNP platform and Metascape. (I,J) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) of DEGs analysis
  produced by String (string-db.org) and Cytoscape (Cytoscape.org). (K) Venn diagram
  representing overlapping genes obtained from the interaction between MACNP platform
  and bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools. (L,M) Further research schedule.'
