figure_title: 'DEGs commonly expressed among the datasets. Hierarchical clustering
  heatmaps of upregulated and downregulated DEGs extracted from the ICD induction
  GEO dataset (A), cGAS-STING pathway activated GEO dataset (B), and TCGA LUAD patients
  who received pharmaceutical therapy (C). The selected threshold was set as |log2FC|>1.0
  and adjusted p<0.05. The Venn diagrams show the 22 commonly expressed genes in the
  two GEO datasets (D) and the 15 commonly expressed genes among all three datasets
  (E). DEGs: Differentially expressed genes; FC: fold change; GEO: Gene Expression
  Omnibus; ICD: immunogenic cell death; LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma; TCGA: The Cancer
  Genome Atlas'
