caption: The construction of Med1epi−/− mice and the thickness of oral mucosa epithelium.
  (A) The construction diagram of Med1epi−/− mice, (B) Electrophoresis results of
  loxP primers and Cre primers. The Genotypes were determined by PCR using genomic
  DNA derived from MED1 heterozygous mutant, MED1 homozygous mutant, and control mice.
  (+/+) represented homozygous positive type, (+/−) heterozygous type and (−/−) homozygous
  negative type in loxP electrophoretic diagram, (+) represented positive type and
  (−) represented negative type in Cre electrophoretic diagram, (C) Immunohistochemical
  staining of MED1 in oral mucosa epithelium of control mice (CON) and Med1epi−/−
  mice (KO) before modeling. Black arrowheads indicate MED1-positive cells, (D,E)
  H–E staining images of the oral mucosa and analysis of oral mucosal epithelial thickness.
  White arrowheads represent the epithelial thickness. Scale bar = 200 μm (10 × and
  50 μm (40 ×). **** p < 0.0001. All data were presented as means ± SD.
