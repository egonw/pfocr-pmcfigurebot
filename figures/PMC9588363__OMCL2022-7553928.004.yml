caption: PTEN downregulation promoted EMT via the PI3K/AKT pathway. si-PTEN or scr-siRNA
  was transfected into HK-2 cells stimulated with TGF-β1. (a, b) qRT–PCR was performed
  to measure the mRNA levels of PTEN, PI3K, AKT, α-SMA, COL1, and FN in the control,
  TGF-β1, TGF − β1 + scr siRNA, and TGF − β1 + si − PTEN groups. (c–e) WB-based outcomes
  for the PTEN, PI3K, COL1, p-AKT, t-AKT, α-SMA, and FN levels. In the results analysis,
  t-AKT and GAPDH served separately as the internal references for p-AKT as well as
  other proteins. (f, h) Typical immunofluorescence images showing PTEN and PI3K.
  PTEN was clearly distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. PI3K was mostly expressed
  in the cytoplasm. DAPI, blue; PTEN and PI3K, red; scale bars, 50 μm. (g, i) Fluorescence
  intensity of PTEN and PI3K. The data are rendered in terms of means ± SDs, n = 3.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 against the TGF-β1/control
  group.
