caption: Regulation of plant hormone signaling pathway in viviparous and nonviviparous
  Nymphaea species. Heatmap based log 2 FC values of DEGs related to auxin (a), cytokinin
  (c), and brassinosteroid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (d) in all four developmental
  stages. Pathway map (b) showing the differential regulation of plant hormone signaling
  pathway between N. micrantha and N. colorata. In pathway map (b), the genes highlighted
  in green are downregulated, in red are upregulated, and in yellow are up-/downregulated
  DEGs.
