figure_title: Human acral versus cutaneous melanoma have distinct positional identity
  gene programmes
caption: a, RNA-seq performed on samples from 61 patients with acral melanoma and
  53 patients with cutaneous melanoma. b, Waterfall plot representation of GSEA pathway
  analysis of human acral versus cutaneous melanoma showing the top 2,000 enriched
  pathways and highlighting pathways related to limb development and positional identity.
  GSEA analysis is controlled for disease stage. Only pathways with FDR < 0.05 are
  highlighted. The specific pathways highlighted in the plot are shown in  and . c,
  Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes between acral and cutaneous
  melanoma samples. Genes with FDR-adjusted P-value (Padj) < 0.05 are indicated in
  blue. P-values calculated using DESeq2. d, Box plots showing differences in gene
  expression between acral melanoma and cutaneous melanoma samples. The centre line
  indicates the median, box edges show 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers extend
  to the largest and smallest values up to 1.5× the interquartile range. FDR = 0.05;
  adjusted P-values calculated using a two-sided Wald test with DESeq2. e, HOXB13
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) on an acral melanoma tissue microarray. Representative
  images of three samples are shown. A total of 30 samples was independently scored
  for extent and intensity, and are represented by the pie charts. LN, lymph node.
  f, HOMER known-motif enrichment analysis on genes upregulated in acral versus cutaneous
  melanoma (log2 fold change cut-off ±1.5, two-sided Wald test with Padj < 0.05; within
  ±500 bp of the transcription start site (TSS).
