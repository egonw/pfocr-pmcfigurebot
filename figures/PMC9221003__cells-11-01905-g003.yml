caption: 'Epithelial GR modulates gene expression in intestinal mucosa from DSS-treated
  mice. (A) Top five upstream regulators and canonical pathways from gene expression
  microarray in GRiKO DSS vs. GRflox DSS (Comparison 1), GRiKO DSS vs. GRiKO Ctol
  (Comparison 2), and GRflox DSS vs. GRflox Ctol (Comparison 3) using Ingenuity Pathway
  Software (IPA); (B) Venn diagram of the overlap in significant gene probes determined
  from 3 comparisons; (C) Number of gene probes either induced (up) or repressed (down)
  by each comparison; (D) Gene probes that showed statistically significant differences
  for any of the three comparisons and that affected immune response and steroidogenesis
  pathway were selected and grouped into five categories: (1) steroidogenesis, (2)
  cytokines, (3) M1-like markers, (4) M2-like markers and (5) re-epithelialization.
  The heatmap indicates increased (red/upregulated) or decreased (green/downregulated)
  expression levels. Two-way ANOVA (p < 0.05); (E) Nr5a2 transcript (relative to Ppib)
  from colonic samples from each mice group. one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s post-test.**
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.'
