caption: 'After different concentrations of JWYHD-M containing serum and different
  doses of JWYHD intervened in the BMSCs, the cell differentiation was detected. (a)
  ARS and ORS (Scale ‘bar: 200 μm). (b) MTT was used to determine the value-added
  degree of 48 h BMSCs cultured in serum containing varying concentrations of JWYHD-M
  (0–15%). (c) The ARS matrix mineralization area. (d) The ORS lipidation area. (e)
  ARS and ORS (Scale bar: 200 μm). (f) The increase in BMSCs after 24 and 48 hours
  of treatment with different doses (0–400 μg/ml) of JWYHD. (g) The ARS matrix mineralization
  area. (h) The ORS lipidation area. The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
  (n = 3), P < 0.05 were considered as significant difference: ∗ VS. CTRL group, #VS.
  15% JWYHD-M serum group or 400 μg/ml JWYHD group.'
