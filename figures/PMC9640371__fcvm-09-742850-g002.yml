caption: 'Identification and validation of differentially expressed genes involved
  in integrin signaling pathway in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells (pAVICs)
  exposed to nitric oxide (NO) donor or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). (A) Heatmap represents
  Z-scored expression of 32 differentially expressed genes involved in the integrin
  signaling pathway in individual cells from control, NO donor, and GSNO treated pAVICs.
  (B) Diagram representing the protein product of differentially regulated integrin
  pathway genes, which were S-nitrosylated in valve interstitial cells (VICs). The
  circle inside represents S-nitrosylated proteins enriched after NO donor treatment.
  (C) Transcriptional expression of 11 representative genes from the integrin signaling
  pathway was estimated in control, NO donor, and GSNO-treated pAVICs by quantitative
  real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (D) Immunofluorescence images represent
  the decreased expression of ITGA8 (red) with NO donor and GSNO when compared to
  untreated control pAVICs, co-stained with nuclear DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 20 μm.
  (E) The graph shows the quantification of fluorescence intensity of ITGA8 expression
  in control, NO donor, and GSNO treated pAVICs normalized to the number of cells.
