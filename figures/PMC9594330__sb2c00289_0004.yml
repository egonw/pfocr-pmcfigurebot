caption: 'Impact on the EA 4′-O-glycosylation by AtMYB85 coexpression. (A) Extracted
  ion chromatograms (EIC) for EA (m/z [M + H]+: 401.1231) as detected by LC–MS in
  N. benthamiana leaves expressing the EA pathway along with the CA pathway, AtMYB46
  or AtMYB85. Earlier eluting peaks are in-source fragmentation products of EA 4′-O-glycosides.
  The AtMYB85 chromatogram is to scale, and the AtMYB46 chromatogram is scaled by
  20× and the CA pathway by 5×. (B) EA and its metabolic products (4′-O-glycosides)
  in plant extracts from N. benthamiana expressing the heterologous EA pathway. The
  x-axis shows the source of CA biosynthesis boosted by the CA pathway, AtMYB46, or
  AtMYB85 coexpression. Acid-hydrolysis treatment removes glycosyl groups from EA
  4′-O-glycoside products. Data points show EIC peak integrations for corresponding
  ion species (m/z: 585.1579 [M + Na]+ for EA-glc, 671.1583 [M + Na]+ for EA-glc-mal,
  and 401.1231 [M + H]+ for EA) as detected by LC–MS. Bar heights indicate the means
  of biological triplicates, and error bars indicate standard deviations.'
