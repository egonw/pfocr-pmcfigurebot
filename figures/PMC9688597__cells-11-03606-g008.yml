caption: The association of LTB4R with EMT and the effects of LTB4R on the AKT/mTOR
  pathway. (A) The difference of EMT scores defined by using ssGSEA between LTB4R
  high expressed group and LTB4R low expressed group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, ** p
  < 0.01. (B) The association of LTB4R expression with EMT score. (C,D) Western blot
  analysis showed that knockdown of LTB4R reduced the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR
  in Caki1 and ACHN cells. (E,F) Western blot analysis showed that overexpression
  of LTB4R increased the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR in Caki1 and ACHN cells. (G)
  The difference of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway scores defined by using ssGSEA between
  LTB4R high expressed group and LTB4R low expressed group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
  ** p < 0.01. (H) The association of LTB4R expression with AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  score, (** p < 0.01).
