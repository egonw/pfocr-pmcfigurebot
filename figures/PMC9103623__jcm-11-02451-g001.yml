caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway implicated in VIDD development.
  Endotoxin-induced augmentation of mechanical stretch-mediated ROS generation and
  diaphragm injury are associated with diaphragm proteolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  autophagy, as well as activation of the caspase-3, calpain, and ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathways. Diaphragm weakness can be attenuated by administering antioxidants, enoxaparin,
  or through partial support for mechanical ventilation or pulmonary rehabilitation.
  Akt = serine/threonine kinase/protein kinase B; ETC = electron transport chain;
  FoxO1 = Class O of forkhead box1; HIF = hypoxia-inducible factor; LC3 = light chain
  3; LMWH = low-molecular-weight heparin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; mtDNA = mitochondrial
  DNA; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; MuRF-1 = muscle ring finger-1; NF-κB
  = nuclear factor κappa B; PI3-K = phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase; ROS = reactive oxygen
  species; TLR4 = toll-like receptor 4; VIDD = ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction.
