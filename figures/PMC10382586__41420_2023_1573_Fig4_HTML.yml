figure_title: Parkin/BINP3-mediated mitophagy promotes DNA damage in vitro
caption: ParkinKD and BNIP3KD lines of PANC-1 and SW1990 cells were generated by siRNA
  interference technology (A). CCK8 assay (B) and clone formation assay (C) were used
  to detect the cell proliferation after 4 Gy X-ray irradiation, flow cytometry (D)
  and comet assay (E) was used to detect cell cycle arrest and DNA damage at 48 h
  after irradiation. Immunofluorescence assay (F–H) and western blot analysis (I)
  were used to quantify the expression of γ-H2AX, 53BP1, and PARP1, as well as the
  activation of the ATR/ATM signaling pathway (J). The cells were treated with the
  SSB inhibitor AZ9482 (1 nM) and the DSB inhibitor Gimeracil (1 mM), and mitophagy
  level changes were observed using western blot analysis (K–N).
