caption: Immune effect of cisplatin in bladder cancer is related to the activation
  of cGASSTING pathway. (A) Basic transcription levels of STING in bladder cancer
  cell line on CCLE database. (B–D) T24 and TCCSUP cell lines were treated with 2
  μg/mL cisplatin for 0 h (control group), 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 20 h, 28 h at standard
  condition, respectively. (B) ELISA analysis of IL-6 secretion in supernatants in
  cisplatin treated T24 and TCCSUP cell lines and corresponding control groups for
  different time points. (C) IFN Bio-assay in cisplatin treated T24 and TCCSUP cell
  lines and corresponding control groups for different time points. (D) qRT-PCR analysis
  of cytokines and chemokines expression in cisplatin treated T24 and TCCSUP cell
  lines and corresponding control groups for different time points. Shown are genes
  induced at least two repeats. (E) Immunofluorescence assay showed subcellular distribution
  of p65 in T24 and TCCSUP cell lines treated with 2 μg/mL cisplatin or PBS for 24
  h. Scale bar represent 5 μm. (F) Western blotting results of key proteins involved
  in cGAS-STING pathway in T24 and TCCSUP cell lines treated with 2 μg/mL cisplatin
  for 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, respectively. GAPDH was used as control protein.
