caption: Membrane channels in sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction. When sperm
  enter the female tract, the plasma membrane is partially destabilized because of
  cholesterol depletion. Albumin does not only contribute to cholesterol depletion,
  but also activates HVCN1. This channel is also activated by the higher pH in the
  female tract and the lower concentration of Zn2+ compared to the male tract. One
  of the first events in the capacitation pathway is the activation of SLC4 (NBC)
  channels that contribute to the increase in bicarbonate concentration. This increase
  is also achieved through the cooperation of SLC26 channels with CFTR. The activation
  of CFTR inhibits ENaC channels, and these two events contribute to plasma membrane
  hyperpolarization. Intracellular pH alkalinization occurs in response to both HCO3−
  influx and H+ efflux through the plasma membrane, which activates both CatSper and
  SLO channels. Both high pH and increased concentration of Ca2+ activate the soluble
  adenylate cyclase (sAC), which increases cAMP levels and, in turn, PKA activity.
  The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation prepares the sperm for the AR, and hyperactivates
  sperm motility. In addition, downstream of the signaling pathways of tyrosine phosphorylation,
  SLC4A1 channels in the acrosome region are phosphorylated, which activates actin
  depolymerization in this region. The increase in progesterone levels that sperm
  encounter in the oocyte vicinity activates CatSper channels in the sperm head, which
  trigger the acrosome reaction.
