caption: '(A,C) Chla content, Chlb content, and Chl a/b ratio in different genotypes
  (t-test for mean data α = 0.05, 0.01, 0.001). Data were taken after 5 days of low-light-treated
  samples for both low-light-tolerant and low-light-sensitive rice genotypes in Kharif,
  2018, and Kharif, 2019. Y-axis represents Chla, b content (mg/gfw) or Chla/b ratio.
  (B,D) Calculation of photosynthetic parameters in tolerant and sensitive rice genotypes
  in Kharif seasons of 2018 and 2019: Net assimilation, stomatal conductance, and
  transpiration measurements were recorded for both open system and treatment with
  a CO2 concentration of 380 μmol L−1 under available light conditions for LL—low
  light, NL—normal light. An average value was calculated from six flag leaves from
  each replicate. Note: In Kharif, 2018, only two rice genotypes, Swarnaprabha and
  IR8, were taken from the same samples which were used for NGS, whereas in Kharif,
  2019, three tolerant genotypes—Swarnaprabha, VL Dhan209, Purnendu—and two sensitive
  rice genotypes—GR4, IR8—were taken for study. The student’s t-test (* p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001) was used to know whether there was any significant
  difference in Chla content Chlb content, Chla/b ratio, net assimilation, transpiration,
  and stomatal conductance between NL and LL conditions.'
