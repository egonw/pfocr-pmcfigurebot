caption: UBR5 globally regulates IFN-γ-mediated pathways and stimulated genes. (A)
  Numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Ubr5-/- compared with GFP 4T1
  cells with or without IFN-γ treatment. Fold change (FC) ≥ 2, p. adjust ˂ 0.05. (B)
  Numbers of DEGs in GFP 4T1 cells or Ubr5-/- 4T1 cells with IFN-γ treatment compared
  with that without IFN-γ treatment. Fold change (FC) ≥ 2, p. adjust ˂ 0.05. (C) Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the top 10 biological
  process between IFN-γ-treated GFP and Ubr5-/- 4T1 cells. (D) Heatmap depicting the
  mRNA levels of selected ISGs in GFP and Ubr5-/- 4T1 cells with or without 10 ng/mL
  IFN-γ induction for 24 h. (E) Scatterplot diagram of genes responding to IFN-γ differently
  in Ubr5-/-cells compared to that in GFP cells. The grey dots represent unchanged
  expression (1/2<FC<2) in both cell lines. Upregulated ISGs with fold change (FC)
  values >2 in Ubr5-/- cells compared with GFP cells are shown with orange dots, while
  downregulated ISGs with fold change (FC) values <1/2 are shown with blue dots. (F)
  The mRNA levels of Cd40, Siglec15 and Isg15 were examined by qPCR analysis in WT,
  Ubr5-/- and hUBR5-reconstituted Ubr5-/- 4T1 cells treated with or without IFN-γ
  for 24 h. All experiments were repeated three times, and the data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
