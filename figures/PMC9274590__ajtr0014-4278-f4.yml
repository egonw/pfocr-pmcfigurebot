caption: Moxibustion reduced the expression of TLR4 and NF-κBp65 in rat intestinal
  tissues. A, B. Representative Western blot images showing the protein expression
  of TLR4, NF-κBp65 and GAPDH (loading control). A quantitative analysis indicated
  that moxibustion reduced the 5-Fu-induced expression of TLR4 and NF-κBp65 in the
  ileum and colon. Moxibustion intervention at 15 min/day exerted a better inhibitory
  effect. The bars represent the means ± SEMs (n = 4 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP
  < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05
  and fP < 0.01 vs the Moxibustion-15 min/day group. C. The mRNA expression of TLR4
  and NF-κBp65 in the ileum and colon was evaluated by qPCR. The bars represent the
  means ± SEMs (n = 6 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP< 0.01 vs the Control group; cP
  < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 vs the Moxibustion-15 min/day
  group.
