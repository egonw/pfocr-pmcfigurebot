caption: Simplified diagram showing one pathway by which cancer skews the NLR toward
  neutrophils. References in text. Many steps in the processes of neutrophil retention
  and release from marrow are not shown here. Many other cytokines not shown here
  influence and drive both retention and release. G(M)-CSF has many other effects
  both within marrow and on non-hematopoietic tissues. The depicted action of G(M)-CSF
  is one among many. The depicted trigger for neutrophil release from marrow, G(M)-CSF,
  is one trigger among many. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 is now called CXCL12. One
  of its main receptors is CXCR4. TAMs, tumor associated macrophages, are macrophages
  or monocyte lineage cells resident within tumors. TANs, tumor associated neutrophils
  are intratumoral neutrophils. Less mature neutrophils encompasses a subset with
  T cell suppressing attributes, the MDSC, myeloid derived suppressor cells. MDSC
  are arginase-1 producing cells that damage nearby T cells.
