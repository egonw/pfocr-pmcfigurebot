caption: Before therapy begins, patients who later on develop ICI-induced irAE have
  a different gene expression than those who remain irAE-free. Volcano plots and pathway
  enrichment plots showing the gene-expression differences before ICI-therapy. (A)
  Total ICI-treated patients. Those who developed arthritis irAE (n=21) versus those
  who remained irAE-free (n=135). (B) Patients treated only with anti-PD-1 ICI. Those
  who developed arthritis irAE (n=7) versus those who remained irAE-free (n=73). (C)
  ICI-treated irAE patients who developed severe arthritis (grade 3–4; n=7) versus
  those who developed mild arthritis (grade 1–2; n=14). Horizontal dotted line represents
  p<0.05; horizontal dashed line represents adjusted p<0.05. ICI, immune checkpoint
  inhibitor; irAE, immune-related adverse event.
