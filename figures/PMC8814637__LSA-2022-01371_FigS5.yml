figure_title: Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment validation using Manhattan
  distance
caption: 'Complete hierarchical clustering overview of proteins detected in both viral
  infections using Manhattan distance to validate the Euclidean distance-driven clustering
  in . Each row represents the mean log2 fold-change (FC) for a protein upon viral
  infection compared to control. Total number of proteins: 4,602 in translatome and
  5,245 in proteome. Similarity of proteins and pathways reports the percentage of
  proteins and significantly enriched pathways found in the Euclidean clusters ()
  to also be present in the Manhattan clusters. The top 3 pathways (reactome pathway
  enrichment was used for all clusters except T-C2 and P-C2 for which GAD disease
  enrichment was used) are also reported for the Manhattan clusters.'
