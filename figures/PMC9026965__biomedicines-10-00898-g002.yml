caption: 'Dysfunctional or impaired mitochondria are removed from the cell via mitophagy.
  Defective mitochondria are loaded into the autophagosomes followed by lysosomal
  degradation. Mitophagy takes place by selective autophagy of mitochondria via receptor-mediated
  mitophagy or ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy. The mitophagy receptors participating
  in the selective clearance of mitochondria include BNIP3/NIX and FUDNC1 and the
  PINK1/Parkin pathway. The preservation of the normal mitochondrial control is one
  of the most important actions of vitamin D. During muscle regeneration, 1,25(OH)2D3
  stimulates an increase in VDR levels in satellite cells and central myonuclei. This
  process subsidizes the preservation of satellite cell self-renewal capacity. VDR
  increases mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion signaling, and inhibiting ROS production
  mitigates antioxidant demand, which promotes regenerative phenotype. Abbreviations:
  BNIP3/NIX: BCL2 interacting-protein-3-like; FUNDC1 = FUN14 domain-containing 1;Â 1,25(OH)2D3
  = 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; MFN 1/2 = Mitofusin 1/2; Parkin = Parkinson protein
  2, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; PINK1 = PTEN-induced putative kinase protein-1;
  RHOT1/MIRO: Ras homolog family member T; VDR = Vitamin D receptor.'
