caption: 'Upstream regulators of differential gene expression caused by Arc knockdown.
  The map shows 11 upstream regulators (blue and orange boxes) predicted by IPA to
  mediate altered gene expression upon Arc knockdown. Genes are positioned in the
  extracellular space, the plasma membrane, the cytosol, or the nucleus, depending
  on where their associated proteins are located. Arc was positioned at the interface
  of nucleus and cytoplasm because it can be in either compartment. Only genes that
  were involved in the following pathways and disease annotations are shown: (i) opioid
  signalling, (ii) synaptogenesis, (iii) endocannabinoid neuronal synapse pathway,
  (iv) synaptic LTD, (v) neuroinflammation, (vi) CNS amyloidosis, (vii) tauopathy
  and (viii) AD. Genes associated with disease annotations are boxed in magenta. The
  respective fold changes are indicated below each gene.'
