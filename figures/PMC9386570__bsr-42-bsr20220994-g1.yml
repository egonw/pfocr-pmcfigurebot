figure_title: NEDD8, UBA3, UBE2M and RBX1 were over-expressed in AML patients and
  were correlated with worse OS
caption: (A–D) Compared with normal control, the mRNA levels of NEDD8, UBA3, UBE2M
  and RBX1 were significantly higher in AML patients. (E–G) As revealed by FAB subtype
  analysis, the mRNA expression levels of NEDD8, UBE2M and RBX1 were higher in patients
  with AML-M2, M4 and M5 than those in healthy controls. In patients with AML-M5,
  the mRNA expression of UBA3 was higher than that in the control group. (H–K) Survival
  analysis revealed that the OS rate of patients with overexpression of NEDD8, UBA3,
  UBE2M and RBX1 was lower than that of patients with low-expression. ROC curves were
  plotted based on the mRNA expression levels of NEDD8, UBA3, UBE2M and RBX1, respectively,
  and Jorden index was calculated to determine the cut-off value (NEDD8, 1.4257; UBA3,
  1.6511; UBE2M, 1.6146; RBX1, 1.4026) to divide the samples into high and low expression
  groups. An independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the means between
  the two groups. Triplicates were set for each gene in each sample for RT-qPCR. Chi-square
  test was performed to compare the qualitative data. The KM method was employed to
  draw the survival curves of patients, and log-rank tests were utilized to compare
  the survival rates. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were adopted to determine
  whether the expression of the interested genes was the independent prognostic factor
  for OS; ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05.
