caption: Identification and characteristics of PRS. (a) Consensus matrix heatmap of
  two subtypes (k = 2). (b) The correlation between CDF and consensus index under
  consensus CDF curve when k = 2–7. (c) The relative change in area under the CDF
  curve when k = 2–7. (d) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of OS between Cluster1 and
  Cluster2. (e) The volcano plot of differentially expressed PRS genes. (f) GO enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed PRS genes. (g) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed PRS genes. BP, biology process; CC, cellular component;
  MF, molecular function.
