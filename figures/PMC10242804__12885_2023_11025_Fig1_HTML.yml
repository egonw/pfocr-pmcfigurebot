caption: 'Screening and identification of viruses with overexpressed and knocked down
  AQP8. A-B Confirmation of the expression of AQP8 in A172 and U251: (A) The expression
  level of AQP8 in A172 and U251 cells. (B) The comparison of AQP8 protein content
  (ns, no significant difference). C-D Virus screening: (C, D) relative mRNA expression
  analysis of AQP8 in all groups, including one negative control, three overexpression
  and three knockdown groups of AQP8 (vs. control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). Viruses
  d and f have better effects on overexpression and knockdown in both cell types.
  E-H NC virus screening for an overexpressed virus and a knockdown virus by western
  blot: (E) Expression of AQP8 in different groups after A172 cell infection. (G)
  Bar graph of the relative expression of AQP8 in A172 cells. (E) Expression of AQP8
  in different groups after U251 cell infection. (H) Bar graph of the relative expression
  of AQP8 in U251 cells. AQP, aquaporin; NC, negative control; O.E, overexpressed;
  K.D, knockdown. All experiments were performed in triplicate'
article_title: AQP8 promotes glioma proliferation and growth, possibly through the
  ROS/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.
