caption: TGF-β1-induced HK-2 fibrosis model. (A) HK-2 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL
  TGF-β1 for 72 h. The morphological changes were observed using a microscope. (a)
  Normal HK-2 cells. (b) TGF-β1 treated HK-2 cells. (B) Fibrosis-related genes were
  analyzed by real-time PCR using HK-2 cell lysate. (C,D) Fibrosis-related proteins
  and Klotho were detected by Western blotting using HK-2 cell lysate. The results
  are shown as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. Control.
