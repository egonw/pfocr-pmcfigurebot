caption: Secondary assay for the primary SFRP1 mimetic hits analyzing activity as
  Wnt pathway antagonist. The Wnt-reporter cell line LEADING LIGHTÂ® (Enzo Life Sciences,
  Farmingdale, NY, USA) expresses luciferase upon stimulation of the Wnt pathway after
  the addition of recombinant Wnt3a as a Wnt signaling ligand. Candidate SFRP1 mimetic
  hits might inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway at different levels, which should result
  in inhibition of the luciferase-induced luminescence.
