figure_title: A schematic diagram showing HM13, targeted by miR-760, exerts oncogenic
  role in breast cancer through autophagy and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
caption: Downregulated HM13 could activate autophagy by inducing ER-stress, while
  HM13 upregulation could facilitate PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast cancer. Moreover,
  miR-760 negatively targets HM13 by binding to 3â€²-UTR of its mRNA. Thus, HM13 plays
  an oncogenic role in breast cancer progression.
