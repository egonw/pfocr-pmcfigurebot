caption: Formation of new capillaries in the existing vascular network into and inside
  the tumor is essential for the growth and metastasis of EC. circRNAs are involved
  in angiogenesis in EC. (A) circ_0000437 reduces VEGFA expression by blocking the
  association between ARNT and TACC3, which negatively regulates tumor angiogenesis
  and leads to reduced angiogenesis. (B) circ_002577 competitively binds to miR-625-5p,
  resulting in the upregulation of IGF1R and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway, which eventually leads to promotion of the formation of tumor
  blood vessels. Thick blue arrows indicate how circRNAs act. Blue lines indicate
  the product of the next step. Black arrows indicate causality. Dashed arrows indicate
  blocking. Yellow arrows indicate circRNAs acting as miRNA sponges. ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator; circRNA/circ, circular RNA; EC, endometrial carcinoma;
  HIF1-α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α; HRE, hypoxia response element; IGF1R, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor; miRNA/miR, microRNA; P, phosphate group; PKB, protein
  kinase B; TACC3, transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3; VEGFA, vascular
  endothelial growth factor A.
