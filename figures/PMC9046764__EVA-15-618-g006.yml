caption: Schematic diagram of candidate genes from growth‐related pathways under artificial
  selection. Candidate genes were selected by F st, XP‐CLR, and both F st and XP‐CLR
  in the comparison between fast‐growing RF strain and wild RY population were marked
  with green, yellow, and rose colors, respectively. In the comparison between fast‐growing
  ZF strain and wild ZY population, blue, purple, and brown colors were used to represent
  the candidate genes identified by F st, XP‐CLR, and both F st and XP‐CLR, respectively.
  Candidate genes with selection in both comparisons were shown in red. Additionally,
  the components of signaling pathway, not selected, were colored gray. The detailed
  information of the candidate genes was listed in Table
