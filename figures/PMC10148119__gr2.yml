caption: 'PBMC RNA-seq of PBMCs in the fasted and refed state(A and B) Biological
  process and (B) molecular function GO analysis of 971 DE genes from PBMCs. Top 3
  enriched processes shown, ranked by the inverse log of the p-value.(C) Relative
  expression of 28 DE genes (p < 0.05) enriched in the G-protein coupled receptor
  signaling pathway (GO: 0007186). Gene expression (FPKM, Fragments Per Kilobase of
  transcript per Million) indicated by row Z-score as relative increase (red) or decrease
  (blue). Samples (x-axis) grouped by fasted and refed timepoints. Genes (y-axis)
  ranked by mean fold change.(D) GPR18 RNA expression in PBMCs collected at fasting
  and re-feeding timepoints (relative to the mean of fasted group, n = 15/group).
  Significance using a paired t-test, ∗ - p < 0.05.'
