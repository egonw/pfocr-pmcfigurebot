caption: FOXO signaling pathway in HGECs was upregulated by M-PgPs. Relative mRNA
  expression levels of FOXO1 (A), BCL2L11 (B), BCL6 (C), S1PR1 (D), TRAIL (E) and
  KLF2 (F) in HGECs after the treatment of M-PgPs (1:100) for 24 h were analyzed using
  RT-qPCR. HGECs without any treatment served as blank control (BL). HGECs treated
  with P. gingivalis (1:100, 24 h) served as positive control. IL-1β (1 ng mL−1) was
  added 6 h before M-PgPs and P. gingivalis treatment. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
