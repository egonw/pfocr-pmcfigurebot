caption: The correlation of the TIC composition and signaling pathway with EZH2 expression.
  (A) Correlation of the TIC population with EZH2 expression, the Violin diagram shows
  the relationship between the different 22 TIC subpopulations and the KIRC tumor
  samples with low (green) or high (red) EZH2 expression, relative to the median of
  the EZH2 expression level, the Wilcoxon rank sum was used for the significance test.
  (B) The scatter plot shows the correlation of 12 TIC subpopulations to the EZH2
  expression (p < 0.05), the blue line in each plot shows the fitted linear model
  indicating the proportion tropism of the immune cell along with the EZH2 expression,
  and the Pearson coefficient was used for the correlation test. (C) The Venn plot
  displays nine TIC subpopulations correlated with the EZH2 expression codetermined
  by difference and correlation tests displayed in violin and scatter plots, respectively.
  (D) The gene set enrichment analysis for the enriched gene sets with high and low
  EZH2 expression in the KEGG collection, each line represents one particular gene
  set with a unique color, upregulated gene sets are located on the left near at the
  origin of the coordinates, in contrast, the downregulated gene sets are on the right
  of the x-axis. Only gene sets with NOM p < 0.05 and FDR q < 0.06 were considered
  as significant and only some of the leading pathways are displayed in the plot.
