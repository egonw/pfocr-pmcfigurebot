caption: Yu et al. established an efficient approach to access benzimidazoles by the
  reaction between aromatic primary amines and o-phenylenediamines using Fe(NO3)3
  and TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl) as a catalytic system and air
  as an oxidant. Various products were formed in good to excellent yields under aerobic
  and solvent-free conditions (). A tentative reaction pathway was presented.
