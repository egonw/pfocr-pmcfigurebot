caption: 'OEA attenuated myocardial tissue injury in diabetic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion
  rats. (A,B) Evans blue-TTC staining of myocardium, in which blue represents the
  region of healthy myocardial tissue, and red represents the region of ischemia-reperfusion
  injury (n = 6); (C) HE staining of myocardial tissue, including hematoxylin (blue)
  staining of nucleus, and eosin (red) staining of cytoplasm, 20x scale = 100 μm,
  40x scale = 50 μm. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, ΔΔP < 0.01 vs. NOR + I/R group;
  #p < 0.05 vs. DM + I/R group.'
article_title: OEA alleviates apoptosis in diabetic rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
