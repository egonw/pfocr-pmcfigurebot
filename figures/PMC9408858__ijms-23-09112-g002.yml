caption: Differential activation of MAPK and ER-stress signaling pathways results
  in the differential activation of apoptotic pathways. (A) Schematic indicating the
  classical MAPK signaling pathways studied due to classical 254-nanometer UVC irradiation.
  (B) Representative Western blots of phosphor-ERK (Thr202, Tyr204), total ERK1/2,
  phosphor-JNK/SAPK (Thr183, Tyr185), total JNK1/2, phosphor-p38 (Thr180, Tyr182),
  p38, phosphor-ATF2 (Thr69), and GAPDH from ARPE-19 cells exposed to 0, 20, and 60
  min of respective UVC wavelengths. (C) Schematic indicating the proteins involved
  in endoplasmic-reticulum-induced stress pathway. (D) Representative Western blots
  of phosphor-PERK (Thr980), total ERK1/2, phosphor-EIF2a (Ser49), EIF2a, and GAPDH
  from ARPE-19 cells exposed to 0, 20, and 60 min of respective UVC wavelengths.
