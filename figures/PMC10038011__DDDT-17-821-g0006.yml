caption: '(A and B) The levels of c-IAP2, E-cadherin, JNK and c-Jun after 0.1% DMSO
  or ICA treatment for 24 h in MDA-MB-468 and Hs 578T cells were analyzed by Western
  blot and quantification of c-IAP2, E-cadherin, JNK and c-Jun protein expression.
  Results are displayed as mean Â± SD (**p < 0.01). (C) The molecular docking simulation
  diagram of ICA molecular combined with c-Jun protein. The ICA is represented by
  red stick models while proteins are represented by green models. ICA (D) and JNK
  inhibitor - SP600125 (E) and Jun protein were verified to establish hydrogen bonds.
  Green dotted lines: carbon hydrogen bond interactions.'
