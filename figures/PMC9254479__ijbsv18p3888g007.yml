caption: CircPFKFB4 enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of p27 via DDB2 under
  hypoxia. (A) KEGG pathway analysis in hypoxic BC cells after down-regulation of
  circPFKFB4. (B) The protein levels of p27 and its downstream molecules in hypoxic
  MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were monitored using western blot. (C and D) P27 in circPFKFB4
  overexpressed or circPFKFB4 silenced cells cultured under hypoxia with/without 20
  µM MG132 treatment for 12 h was detected by western blot. (E and F) P27 protein
  level in hypoxic BC cells transfected with indicated plasmid (E) or siRNAs (F) was
  measured by western blot after CHX treatment for indicated times. (G and H) BC cells
  were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid, circPFKFB4 overexpression plasmid
  (G), or siRNAs (H) under hypoxic conditions. At 48 h of post-transfection, the cells
  were treated with MG132 (20 μM) for 12 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
  using anti-p27 antibody, and then the ubiquitylated proteins were checked using
  anti-HA antibody (top). The cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-p27 antibody
  (bottom). (I and J) Hypoxic MCF-7 (I) and MDA-MB-231 (J) cells were co-transfected
  with HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid and various plasmids as indicated. 48 h after transfection,
  the cells were harvested and lysed after 12 h of 20 µM MG132 treatment. The samples
  immunoprecipitated by anti-p27 antibody were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody
  (top). The cell lysates were validated by immunoblotting with anti-p27 antibody
  (bottom). (K and L) Hypoxic MCF-7 (K) and MDA-MB-231 (L) cell lysates were analyzed
  by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Data are presented as mean ± SD
  and representative of three independent experiments in (B, K and L). *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001.
