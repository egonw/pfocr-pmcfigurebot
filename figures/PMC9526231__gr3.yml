caption: Impact of 3-NP on global transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq. (A) Expression
  heatmap showing differential RNA-seq feature counts for COV434 cells with or without
  3-NP treatment. This heatmap was built on normalized gene read counts. C = CONTROL;
  N = 3-NP. (B) Volcano plot obtained from DESeq2 analysis showing DEGs (|log2 fold
  change| ≥ 1 and P < 0.01) after 3-NP treatment. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs.
  GeneRatio is defined as (count of core enrichment genes)/(count of pathway genes).
  (D) The ridge plot visualizing the expression distributions of core enriched genes
  for GSEA enriched Hallmark gene sets. (E) GSEA results of the Hallmark pathway ‘MITOTIC
  SPINDLE’, ‘HYPOXIA’, ‘G2M CHECKPOINT’ and KEGG pathway ‘Cell Cycle’ are shown.
