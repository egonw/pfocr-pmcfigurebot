caption: 'Characterization of serglycin (SRGN)‐COLI hydrogel altered the heterogeneity
  of hECs in the human spinal cord‐derived primary astrocyte (hspASC)‐human umbilical
  vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) co‐culturing model via single‐cell RNA sequencing
  analysis. (A) The proportion of ECs subgroups in hspASCs‐hECs co‐culture model under
  COLI/SRGN‐COLI condition. *adjusted p < 0.05; **adjusted p < 0.01; ***adjusted p < 0.001.
  The exact p‐value is listed in Figure . (B,C) The heatmap shows the scaled gene
  expression level of adherens/tight junction genes and EndoMT marker genes in endothelial
  cells sub‐population. (D) Epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition score of e3 and e6
  endothelial cell subgroup. (Wilcox test). (E) Diagram of the experimental design
  to test the conditional medium system for neural progenitor cells culturing. (F–H)
  Immunofluorescence analysis and qualification of MAP2 in hNSCs under different condition
  medium. Scale Bar: 50 μm. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (t‐test, mean ± SEM).'
