caption: CD155 overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in EC. A Analysis
  of CD155 protein levels in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal
  adenocarcinoma (EAC) using gene expression data available in Oncomine. Expression
  levels of CD155 in normal (left plot) and cancer tissue (right plot) were plotted
  using GraphPad Prism software. The y-axis represents median ratio. B Progression-free
  survival (PFS) analysis in patients with high and low CD155 expression levels. Image
  obtained from the cBioPortal. C Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in patients with
  ESCC with low and high CD155 expression. D, E Analysis of CD155 expression levels
  in HEEC, Eca109 and Kyse510 cultured cells. D mRNA levels were analyzed using qRT-PCR.
  E Protein levels were measured using western blot F Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
  of CD155 protein levels in ESCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
article_title: CD155 promotes radioresistance and malignancy of esophageal cancer
  by regulating Hippo-YAP pathway.
