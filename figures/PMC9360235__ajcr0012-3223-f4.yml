caption: MIR133A regulates SOX9 and its downstream PIK3CA pathway molecules in CRC
  cell lines. A. Western blot analysis of SOX9 and downstream PIK3CA, MAP2K1, CDH2,
  and BAX in HCT116 and SW48 cells transfected with MIR133A mimic. B. Western blot
  analysis of SOX9 and its downstream PIK3CA-pAKT1-GSK3B-CTNNB1 in HCT116 and SW48
  cells transfected with MIR133A mimic. C. SOX-9 and its downstream PIK3CA-pAKT1-GSK3B-CTNNB1
  in HCT116 and SW48 cells transfected with siSOX9. The protein levels of respective
  genes were determined by western blotting and densitometry using Image J, where
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. The representative data from at least three
  independent experiments are shown. Each bar represents mean fold alternation above
  or below control (Â± SD). Differences were considered statistically significant *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 compared with control (ns = not significant).
