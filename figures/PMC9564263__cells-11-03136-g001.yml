caption: Schematic diagram of insulin signaling pathway activation. Insulin secreted
  by pancreatic islet beta cells binds to INSR and activates it. The activated cytoplasmic
  kinase domain of INSR phosphorylates IRS1, triggering different downstream signaling
  pathways. Among them are the IRS1-phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway,
  which regulates insulin metabolism, and the SHC-Ras-MAPK pathway responsible for
  growth and differentiation, which are two of the most critical kinase-dependent
  pathways triggered by insulin stimulation.
