caption: Site‐specific protein phosphorylation map of death receptor signaling pathways
  in response to chronic ethanol in C57BL/6 and Rip3‐deficient mice. A regulated phosphorylation
  pathway/network of TNFα/TNFR1 signaling was constructed based on Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis and literature searches to illustrate the effects of chronic ethanol on
  the major pathways of DR signaling in (A) C57BL/6 and (B) Rip3 −/− mice. The map
  includes DR signaling pathways affected by ethanol (Figure ), including apoptosis,
  NF‐κB, p38 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, and necroptosis. Phosphoproteins containing phosphorylation
  sites displaying statistical significance p < 0.05 changes in abundance ranging
  from 1.2‐fold to 8‐fold were included and annotated with their phosphorylation sites,
  color‐coded to indicate significant increases (red), decreases (green), or no change
  (black) in phosphorylation responses. DR, death receptor; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa B; Rip3,
  receptor‐interacting protein kinase 1; SAPK, stress‐activated protein kinase; TNF,
  tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor
article_title: Phosphoproteomics identifies pathways underlying the role of receptor‐interaction
  protein kinase 3 in alcohol‐associated liver disease and uncovers apoptosis signal‐regulating
  kinase 1 as a target.
