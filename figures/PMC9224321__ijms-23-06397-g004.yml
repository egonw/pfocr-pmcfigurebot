caption: 'Transmission electron micrographs revealed significant increases in the
  numbers of autophagic vacuoles (arrows) in granulosa cells from females treated
  with low (A) and high doses of allethrin (B,C). Autophagic vacuoles are double-membrane
  structures that contain a number of atypical and/or injured mitochondria, endoplasmic
  reticulum membranes and cytoplasm (C). However, these autophagosomes were not detected
  in oocytes or theca cells. GC: granulosa cell, Nu: nucleus, Op: ooplasm, TC: theca
  cell and ZP: zona pellucida.'
