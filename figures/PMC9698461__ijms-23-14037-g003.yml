caption: Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 4 and 14 dpi
  groups compared with the control group. (a) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot
  shows clustering of three groups, with axes corresponding to the two different principal
  components. The blue, green and red dots represent the control, 4 dpi and 14 dpi
  samples, respectively, with 3 parallel samples in each group. (b) Venn diagrams
  of RNA-Seq showing the overlap of genes upregulated or downregulated in the skin
  at 4 or 14 dpi versus control fish. (c,d) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs related
  to defense responses and immune responses. The size of the bubbles represents number
  of genes in a pathway, while the color represents âˆ’Log10(p-adj). Rich factor of
  the X-axis refers to (the number of DEGs annotated to the GO term)/(the total number
  of genes annotated to the GO term).
