caption: Effect of carambolaside W on the cellular mitochondrial membrane potential
  of MDCK cells infected with H1N1 influenza virus. (A) Comparison of the mitochondrial
  membrane potential of MDCK cells infected with H1N1 influenza virus and the change
  of MDCK mitochondrial membrane potential after adding carambolaside W. (B) Inverted
  microscope detection to observe the change in mitochondrial membrane potential.
  At high mitochondrial membrane potential, J-aggregates are formed and show red fluorescence;
  at low mitochondrial membrane potential, JC-1 is monomeric and shows green fluorescence.
  The concentration of carambolaside W used here is 32 Î¼M, each experiment was carried
  out a minimum of three times (n = 3).
