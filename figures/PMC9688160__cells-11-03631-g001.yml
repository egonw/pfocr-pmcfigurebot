caption: 'A schematic representation of the ON and OFF state of the Hippo pathway.
  The activation of the Hippo pathway leads to YAP phosphorylation and its subsequent
  sequestration and degradation. By contrast, the inactivation of the Hippo pathway
  allows YAP to enter the nucleus in order to interact with TEAD1–4 and activate their
  target genes. See text for details. The membrane image and DNA double helix are
