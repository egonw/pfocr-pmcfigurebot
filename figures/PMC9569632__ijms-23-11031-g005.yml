caption: Analysis of cellular miRNAs and exosomal miRNAs revealed by real-time RT-PCR
  in PD-L1 transfected cells. Ectopic expression of PD-L1 significantly changed the
  expression levels of miRNAs participating in tumor cell progression and metastasis.
  Altered expression levels of cellular miRNAs in H2170 (ai) and H1299 (bi). Altered
  expression levels of exosomal miRNAs in H2170 (aii) and H1299 (bii). For cellular
  miRNA analysis, U6 was used as an internal control; for exosomal miRNA analysis,
  spike-in protein Sp6 was used as an internal control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001.
