caption: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Signal transduction begins with the attachment
  of Wnt proteins to the seven-pass frizzled (Fz) transmembrane receptors and the
  lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP). When the Wnt ligand is not present
  (OFF), a protein complex consisting of axin, casein kinase (CK) 1, adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) is formed. GSK3β phosphorylates
  β-catenin, tagging it for degradation. The attachment of Wnt to Fz (ON) causes the
  stimulation of the dishevelled (Dvl) protein, resulting in the deactivation of the
  axin protein complex and the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. β-catenin translocated
  into the nucleus forms an active transcriptional complex with T cell-specific factor
  (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) for protein transcription.
