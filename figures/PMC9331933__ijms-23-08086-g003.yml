caption: Gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of multiple pathways involved
  in estrogen signaling and tamoxifen resistance. (A,B) Whole-transcriptome analysis
  of miR-489-transfected and control T47D cells followed by pathway enrichment analysis
  revealed multiple pathways involved in tamoxifen resistance, including ESR-mediated
  signaling and ErBB2 pathways. (C) Heatmap demonstrating downregulation of multiple
  estrogen-responsive genes in miR-489-transfected T47D cells. (D) miR-489 negatively
  regulated estrogen-induced transcription by transient transfection of cells with
  the ERE-reporter system. (E) miR-489 WT and knockout T47D cells were treated with
  ethanol or estrogen for 6 h, and expression of estrogen-responsive genes was examined
  using qRT-PCR. (F,G) qRT-PCR analysis of estrogen-responsive genes upon miR-489
  restoration showed downregulation of estrogen-responsive genes only in ER+ breast
  cancer cell lines. ns, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
  Data are representative of three independent experiments.
