caption: Effect of REA on ROS/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in EC cells. (a) Relative
  mRNA expression of ASK1 and p38 MAPK; (b) relative protein expression of ASK1, p38
  MAPK, and p-p38 MAPK; (c) protein band calculated as a ratio relative to β-actin
  protein levels. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared with the control
  group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
