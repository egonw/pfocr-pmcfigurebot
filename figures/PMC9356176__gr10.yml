caption: 'Heatmap of significantly enriched Reactome Pathways in DS: Comparisons are
  shown on the X axis with Reactome Pathways on the Y axis. When performing tests
  for enrichment, pathways were restricted to include only those with 2 or more genes.
  Note that for the purposes of display, only Reactome Pathways with an enrichment
  p-value less than 0.05, were included. Furthermore, only the top 50 pathways are
  displayed. Color is assigned based on the -log10(enrichment p-value), with lighter
  colors implying less significant enrichment. Hierarchical clustering was applied
  to pathways (rows). The most significant pathways were clustered according to Euclidean
  distance using the complete linkage method. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)'
