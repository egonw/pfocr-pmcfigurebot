caption: 'Early conceptual model of the effect of exercise on depression.Circles represent
  the theoretical relative contribution of each mechanism and how each may change
  from euthymia to depression (and then restored by exercise). White shaded area represents
  a theoretical level of homeostasis amongst such mechanisms.BDNF, 5-HT/NE, inflammation,
  and the HPA-axis have each been identified as possible candidate neurobiological
  mechanisms/pathways involved in depression. In a euthymic state, these implicated
  mechanisms function appropriately, resulting in homeostasis (white shaded area).
  While the interaction between these mechanisms and their scaled contributions remains
  unclear, there is a disruption of homeostasis in depression as abnormalities associated
  with these mechanisms have been identified: reduced BDNF and 5HT/NE signaling, high
  levels of inflammation, and HPA-axis dysfunction. Since targeting one specific mechanism
  or pathway has not been found to completely ameliorate depression, a proposed conceptual
  approach is to view these mechanisms as a whole working system. Exercise is a viable
  contender to address multiple aspects of the biological underpinnings of depression.
  Specifically, aerobic exercise may deliver antidepressant effects via its ability
  to potentially modulate BDNF, 5HT-NE, inflammation, and HPA-axis function and help
  restore homeostasis amongst such mechanisms. Resistance exercise may deliver similar
  benefits, however it remains a scantly studied and underutilized mode of exercise
  for the treatment of depression.'
