caption: HINT1, HAGH, EB1, DRP2, and LAMTOR2 take part in PI3K/Akt/ GSK3β signaling
  pathway. HINT can suppress the activity of GSK3β and play a role in neuroprotection.
  LAMTOR2 is crucial for Akt/mTOR signaling activation and influences endosomal biogenesis
  and receptor trafficking. HAGH takes part in the scavenging system of methylglyoxal
  (MG) which is by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. DRP2 is a brain‐specific substrate of
  GSK3 and Cyclin‐Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK 5) and takes part in axon elongation. GSK‐3β
  regulates the activity of CLIP‐associating protein 2 (CLASP2) and the interaction
  of CLASP2 and EB1 is necessary for the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Go proteins
  are required for the activation of MAPKs and NF‐κB
