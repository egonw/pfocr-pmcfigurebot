caption: Triheptanoin, triglyceride of heptanoate replenishes the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle via the propionyl–CoA carboxylase pathway. Following carboxylation,
  propionyl–CoA converts to succinyl–CoA. Further, heptanoate that enters the cell
  is metabolized into acetyl–CoA, which acts as an anaplerotic fuel for the synthesis
  of citric acid. Lactate produced by glycolysis is transported across the cell membrane
  by co-transport with protons and is mediated by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs).
  Thus, triheptanoin can significantly enhance mitochondrial ATP production. 2 deoxy
  glucose (2DG), an inhibitory analogue of glucose, inhibits the glycolytic pathway
  causing metabolic stress to cells. A-T cells are hypersensitive to metabolic stress,
  which highlights the crucial role of ATM in mitochondrial metabolism and glucose
  homeostasis.
