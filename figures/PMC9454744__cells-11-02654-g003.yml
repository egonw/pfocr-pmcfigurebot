caption: Mechanisms of snoRNAs in HCC. Abnormal expression of snoRNAs could lead to
  various pathophysiological changes. They could regulate a variety of signaling pathways
  by binding or releasing target proteins. Aberrant expression of snoRNAs in HCC could
  activate PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, MAPK/ERK pathways while inhibiting the
  p53 pathway. They played a critical role in cellular processes, including proliferation,
  migration, invasion, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, which were critical for cancer initiation, progression, metastasis,
  and drug resistance.
