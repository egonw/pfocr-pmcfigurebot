caption: Dynamic functional changes in B cells during pregnancy. (A) Volcano plots
  of DEGs in B cells (naïve B cells, memory B cells and plasmablast). Genes with |log2(FC)|
  ≥ 0.3, adjusted p < 0.05, related B‐cell activation and RNA splicing were labelled
  by gene symbols. (B) GO term enrichment of genes which highly expressed in different
  trimester compared to non‐pregnancy in B cell. Red means up‐regulation compared
  to non‐pregnancy, blue means down‐regulation compared to non‐pregnancy. (C) Dot
  plot of BLNK, MS4A1 and CD79B in naïve B cells and memory B cells. Dots sizes represent
  the proportion of cells expressed in four stages. Dot colours represent average
  expression levels of monocytes in four stages. (D) Box plots of the cell scores
  of BLNK, MS4A1 and CD79B in naïve B cells and memory B cells. Wilcoxon rank‐sum
  test was applied. (E and F) Box plots of the cell scores of two GO biological process
  terms (B‐cell receptor signalling pathway and B‐cell activation) in naïve/memory
  B cells and plasmablast across four conditions. (G and H) Box plots of the cell
  scores of two GO biological process terms (RNA splicing and alternative mRNA splicing
  via spliceosome) in naïve/memory B cells and plasmablast across four conditions.
  (I) HNRNPL expression pattern across four conditions; the graph on the right shows
  the significance of three periods of pregnancy compared to non‐pregnant controls.
  Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was applied. All differences with p < 0.05 are indicated.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns = not significant
