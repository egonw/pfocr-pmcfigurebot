caption: Pathway analysis of gene expression differences from PSCs through early retinal
  differentiation. (A,B) Pathway analysis showing the number of DEG/DARs and the FDR
  for the 9 statistically significant pathways between day 15/day 00 (A) and for 9
  of the most significant pathways between day 25/day 00 (B) (FDR < 0.1). Bar graphs
  represent the number of DEG/DARs while line graphs represent the FDR. Further analysis
  was then done using only the DEGs (C,D). (C) “Signaling pathways regulating pluripotency
  of stem cells” was one common pathway between day 15/day 00 and day 25/day 00 based
  upon DEG expression. A Venn diagram of the DEGs detected in “Signaling pathways
  regulating pluripotency of stem cells” at day 25/day 00 and day 15/day 00 time points
  identified 6 genes unique to day 15/day 00, 21 unique genes in day 25/day 00, and
  56 genes common between the comparisons ((C), left). The DEGs were further classified
  into hierarchical cluster analyses of days 00 through 25 of TGFβ signaling, Wnt
  signaling, kinase signaling, and transcription factors and heatmaps of these genes
  were generated ((C), right). (D) “Axon guidance” was also a pathway in common between
  day 15/day 00 and day 25/day 00 based on DEGs. A Venn diagram of the DEGs identified
  in “Axon guidance” at the day 25/day 00 and day 15/day 00 time points identified
  8 unique DEGs in day 15/day 00, 17 unique DEGs in day 25/day 00, and 52 DEGs in
  common between the comparisons ((D), left). DEGs involved in “Axon guidance” were
  further categorized into hierarchical cluster analyses of ephrin, netrin, and semaphorin
  families of genes and heatmaps of these genes were generated ((D), right).
