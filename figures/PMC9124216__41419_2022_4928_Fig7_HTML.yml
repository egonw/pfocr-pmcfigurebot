figure_title: ADAM15 and CD151 cooperate to affect the integrin-related EGFR signalling
  pathway
caption: A Control and CD151-overexpressing stable A549 and H1299 cells were transfected
  with the indicated siRNA (si-ADAM15 compared with si-NC) followed by western blotting.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. B Control and ADAM15-overexpressing stable
  A549 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA (si-CD151 compared with si-NC)
  followed by western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. C, D CD151-overexpressing
  stable A549 and H1299 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA (si-ADAM15
  compared with si-NC) followed by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. E Control and CD151-overexpressing
  stable A549 and H1299 cells were treated with the indicated siRNA (si-αV compared
  with si-NC) followed by western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control.
