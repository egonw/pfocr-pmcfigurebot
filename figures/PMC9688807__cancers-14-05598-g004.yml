caption: Differential gene expression of Notch signaling pathway genes in BCC tissue
  (in blue) compared to healthy skin tissue (in red). Genes are arranged on the x-axis
  by expression level, and the mean gene count (counts per million) value is shown
  on the y-axis. Gene symbols for all of the genes could not be shown on the x-axis.
  Data from patients from the low As exposure group are shown on the left (A), and
  data from patients from the high As exposure group are shown on the right (B). The
  average magnitude of overexpression was significantly higher (p = 4.60 × 10−16)
  if the patient had low As exposure [3.92-fold change (95% CI 3.07–5.01)] compared
  to those with high As exposure [1.14-fold change (95% CI −1.04–1.35)].
