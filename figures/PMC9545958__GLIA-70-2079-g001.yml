caption: Schematic representation of lncRNA AK018453 contributing to the pathology
  of EAE mice via regulating TRAP1/Smad pathway. Response to IL‐17 stimulation, AK018453
  is upregulated in astrocytes, which regulates epigenetically the expression of TRAP1
  through interacting with CBP/P300, in turn promotes the production of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF‐α, CXCL10, and MCP‐1, thus aggravating the EAE progression
