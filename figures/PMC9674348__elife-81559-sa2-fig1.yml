caption: To directly assess whether LRG1 affects the insulin signaling pathway, we
  performed western blots of phospho-AKT (pAKT) and total IRS-1 in db/db eWAT and
  liver. Our assessment of pAKT was limited by the fact that the mice were not stimulated
  with insulin prior to sacrifice. Basal pAKT levels after 6 hours of fasting showed
  no difference in either eWAT or liver (see ). IRS-1 protein levels have been shown
  to be decreased in humans with diabetes (Rondinone et al., 1997) and in ob/ob mice
  (Kerouz et al., 1997). We observed that LRG1 overexpression leads to increased IRS-1
  protein levels in db/db mice, especially in eWAT (Figure 5—figure supplements 1J,K).
  Given the critical role IRS-1 plays in insulin signaling, these results provide
  direct evidence that LRG1’s effect on glycemic profiles involves the insulin signaling
  pathway.
