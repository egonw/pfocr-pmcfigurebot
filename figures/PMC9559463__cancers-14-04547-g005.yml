caption: Schematic representation of the modes of action of novel drugs for basal
  cell carcinoma (BCC) therapy. (A) Loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 or activating
  mutations in SMO activate the HH signaling pathway in BCC cells. CX-4945 acts on
  the terminal HH signaling components by inhibiting casein kinase CK2. Thus, the
  signal transduction pathway is interrupted; (B) STP705 consists of two small interfering
  RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides packaged with a histidine-lysine (HK) polymer as a
  delivery system. The siRNA intermediates bind to an RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC), and then selectively degrade the complementary single-stranded target RNA.
  As the siRNA of STP705 targets the mRNA of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and
  cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2, respectively, it downregulates the expression of TGF-β1
  and COX-2, resulting in tumor growth inhibition; (C) ASN-002 functions as a recombinant
  adenovirus vector, delivering the human interferon (IFN)-γ gene into BCC cells.
  IFN-γ secretion results in a local IFN-γ concentration within the tumor; (D) the
  checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab blocks binding of programmed cell death protein 1
  (PD-1) on T cells to its ligands programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2
  on tumor cells. Relatlimab is an antibody directed against the inhibitory molecule
  lymphocyte-activation gene (LAG)-3. Binding of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein (CTLA)-4 to the B7 molecules as antagonist of CD28 on antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) is blocked by ipilimumab. These checkpoint inhibitors may release the
  T cells from immunosuppressive mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment; (E) Daromun
  (L19IL2/L19TNF) consist of recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α cytokines (respectively), fused to a human single-chain variable fragment
  directed against the extra-domain B (ED-B) of fibronectin (L19). After binding of
  the L19 moieties to the fibronectin on tumor cells, the cytokines can trigger an
  immune response against ED-B fibronectin-expressing tumor cells.
