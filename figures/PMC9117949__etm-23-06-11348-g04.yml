caption: 'LEN suppresses H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of PC12 cells
  by blocking the Notch signaling pathway. The production of (A) MDA, (B) SOD, (C)
  GSH-Px and (D) CAT in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells treated with LEN in the presence
  or absence of Notch agonist JAG, detected by corresponding commercial kits. (E)
  Relative protein expression of Nox2 and Nox4 in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells treated
  with LEN in the presence or absence of Notch agonist JAG, detected by western blotting.
  (F and G) The apoptosis of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells treated with LEN in the presence
  or absence of Notch agonist JAG, detected by TUNEL (magnification, x200). (H and
  I) Relative protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9
  in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells treated with LEN in the presence or absence of Notch
  agonist JAG, detected by western blotting. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. H2O2; ∆P<0.05, ∆∆P<0.01 vs. LEN + H2O2 and
  ∆∆∆P<0.001 vs. LEN + H2O2. LEN, lenalidomide; MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD, superoxide
  dismutase; GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; CAT, catalase; Nox, NADPH oxidase; JAG,
  Jagged-1.'
