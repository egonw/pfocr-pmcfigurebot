caption: Melanoma ALDH1A1 affects Notch signaling in HUVECs in 2D co-culture (Transwell
  system). (A) Notch pathway genes under/over expressed in HUVECs co-cultured with
  A375 ALDH1A1+ vs. HUVECs co-cultured with A375 ALDH1A1SC. (B) Notch pathway genes
  under/over expressed in HUVECs co-cultured with A375 ALDH1A1+ vs. HUVECs co-cultured
  with A375 ALDH1A1KD. Co-cultures were maintained for 6 days The experiment was performed
  twice in duplicate. (C). Evaluation of Notch signaling mediators DLL4, Notch1, RBPSUH
  and ADAM17 in HUVECs alone or co-cultured with A375 clones for 6 days. Î²-actin was
  used as loading control. The experiment was repeated three times. HUVECs, human
  umbilical vein endothelial cells; HUVECcc, HUVECs co-cultured; DLL4, delta-like
  canonical Notch ligand 4; RBPSUH, recombining binding protein, suppressor of hairless;
  ADAM17, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17.
