caption: Neutrophils activate platelets through the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and the activated platelets present high mobility group box 1 to neutrophils
  and induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. NETs bind to FXIIa and
  tissue factor (TF), causing the activation of the coagulation cascade. Neutrophil-derived
  granules degrade the TF pathway inhibitors. Extracellular histone proteins lead
  to thrombin production and platelet activation via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and
  TLR4, enhancing immunothrombosis. DNA that is released from NETs also serves as
  a scaffold for binding neutrophil granule proteins, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin,
  a process that promotes platelet binding. HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; ICAM-1,
  intercellular adhesion molecule 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; vWF, von Willebrand
  factor.
