caption: NTS knockdown in neuron decreased induction on pancreatic cancer invasiveness.
  Differentiated SH-SY5Y (A, C) or Neuro-2a (B, D) was transfected with shLuc or shNTS,
  and 48 h post transfection knockdown efficiency was assayed. Conditioned media from
  above clones were treated onto MIA PaCa-2 (E, G) or KPC (F, H), and the effect on
  migration (E, F) as well as invasion (G, H) was assayed. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01.
