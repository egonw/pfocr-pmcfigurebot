figure_title: Schematic illustration of the new FAK-TAK1-MAPKs/NFκB signaling axis
  in LPS-induced inflammatory response in ALI
caption: Upon LPS challenge, activated FAK directly interacts with TAK1 and then phosphorylates
  TAK1 to activate MAPKs and NFκB signals, which leads to inflammatory cytokine overproduction
  in both cultured macrophages and lung tissues.
article_title: FAK mediates LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury through interacting
  TAK1 and activating TAK1-NFκB pathway.
