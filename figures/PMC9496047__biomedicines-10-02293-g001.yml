caption: Cysteine supplementation may be involved in the promotion of cell proliferation
  in monocytes, abrogating differentiation. In environments with increased cysteine
  bioavailability, the glycine flux will be deviated to the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), increasing the levels of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) that contributes to nucleotide
  synthesis through the phosphoribosyl diphosphate pathway (PRPP). Since the nucleotide
  synthesis (de novo or savage) is dependent on ribose-5-phosphate for the PRPP, the
  shuttle from the folate/methionine cycle to the PPP will favor nucleotide demands
  essentially for cell proliferation. Although folate byproducts are needed for de
  novo nucleotide synthesis, PRPP is the rate-limiting reaction. In theory, proliferating
  cells will favor the PPP instead of the folate/methionine cycle to sustain the PRPP
  through R5P. Moreover, the more active PPP leads to more formate production (metabolite
  increased in cysteine-supplemented monocytes), and NADPH generated from the PPP
  will supply fatty acid synthesis and acetyl-CoA derived from acetate (metabolite
  decreases in cysteine-supplemented monocytes).
