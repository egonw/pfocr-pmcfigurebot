caption: 'Clinical correlation of fatty acid metabolism pathway in patients with ccRCC.
  Beeswarm plots comparing the ssGSEA scores in all ccRCC samples and all adjacent
  normal tissues (A), paired ccRCC samples and adjacent normal tissues (B) and different
  tumor grades (D), AJCC stage (E) and gender (F). (C) Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis showed
  that patients with lower ssGSEA scores of fatty acid metabolism exhibited worse
  OS. ccRCC: Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma; ssGSEA: Single-sample gene set enrichment
  analysis; AJCC: American Joint Committee on Cancer; HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence
  interval. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
  ns: No significance, *** p < 0.001.'
