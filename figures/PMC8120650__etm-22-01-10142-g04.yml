caption: 'MAPK signaling pathway in autophagy and cancer. The MAPK signaling pathway
  mainly includes three subfamilies: ERK, JNK/SAPKII and p38-MAPK. JNK may regulate
  autophagy through Beclin-dependent and -independent signaling. When cells are stimulated
  by signals from growth factors, mitogens and stimuli, the ERK pathway is activated
  by the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK cascade. Extracellular stimulation (including inflammatory
  factors, endotoxin, osmotic pressure, chemotherapy and ultraviolet) or intracellular
  stimulation (including oxidative stress and heavy metals) activates MAPK p38 through
  the TAK1-MKK6-p38 and ASKK1-MKK3-p38 cascades, respectively.'
