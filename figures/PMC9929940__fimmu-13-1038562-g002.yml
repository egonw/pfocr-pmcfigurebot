caption: S-specific IgM and IgG titers in female Balb/c mice treated with EDV-COVID-αGC
  on day 1 and boosted on day 21. (A) Day 28 IgM S-protein specific titers for 2 x
  109 (n = 7) and 3 x 109 dose (n = 10) levels. (B) Day 28 IgG S-protein specific
  titers for 2 x 109 (n = 7) and 3 x 109 (n = 10) dose levels. (C–F) IgM and IgG S-protein
  specific titers for 3 x 109 (n = 10) dose at day 7 (C, D) and at day 21 (n = 10)
  (E, F). Asterisks representing significant values (****p ≤ 0.0001; ***p ≤ 0.001;
  **p ≤ 0.01; *p ≤ 0.05) and numerical p values were measured using two way ANOVA
  and Tukey’s test or one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (2 D and F) on GraphPad Prism
