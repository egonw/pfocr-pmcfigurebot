caption: Identification of DEGs and pathway analysis in validation cohort. (A) Volcanic
  plot of DEGs in GSE62646. The Y-axis represents the -1og10 (P value) and the X-axis
  represents the gene fold change (log2FC). Blue and red colors dots represent low
  and high expression, respectively. (B) Volcanic map of DEGs in GSE50772 dataset.
  (C) Shared genes between the DEGs in GSE62646 and GSE50772. (D) Signaling pathways
  significantly enriched in shared DEGs in validation cohort.
