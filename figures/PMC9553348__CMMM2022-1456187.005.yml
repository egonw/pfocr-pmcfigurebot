caption: 'Effects of PRLR overexpression on intracellular triglyceride content through
  JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathways in IR cells. (a) Western blot detect the expression
  of PRLR in the control group, empty vector and overexpression PRLR group. (b) The
  TG content was detected in the control group, IR group, IR + PRLR NC group, and
  IR + PRLR group. (c) Western blot detect the expressions of PRLR, JAK2, p-JAK2,
  STAT5, and p-STAT5 of different groups. ∗P < 0.05vs. Control; #P < 0.05vs. IR model
  group. Abbreviations: PRLR: prolactin receptor; IR: insulin resistance; NC: normal
  control.'
