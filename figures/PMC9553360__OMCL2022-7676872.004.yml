  on autophagy. (a) Western blot analysis and shading analysis of Beclin 1, Atg5,
  LC3I, and LC3II in Control, high-dose Pb exposure, DAPT, and high-dose Pb exposure+DAPT
  groups. (b) Western blot analysis and shading analysis of mTOR, p-mTOR, P70s6k,
  and p-P70s6k in the four groups. ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01.
