caption: Percentage of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROSs) produced in 20
  ng/mL RANKL-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The cells were treated with CRE-SD-FREE-LIP
  and liposomal CRE-SD (5, 10, and 20 µg/mL). Statistical significance of the difference
  between the corresponding liposomal CRE-SD-treated and CRE-SD-FREE-LIP-treated samples
  is denoted as * p < 0.05, n = 3.
