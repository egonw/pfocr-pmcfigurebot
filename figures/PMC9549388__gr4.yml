caption: Distinct metabolic reprogramming during monocyte to macrophage transition
  in mild versus severe COVID-19(A) Metabolic pathway activities of CD14+ monocyte
  (PBMC-MCs) or CD14+ macrophage (BALF-MCs) from PBMCs or BALF of paired patients
  with mild (n = 2) and severe (n = 5) COVID-19. Statistically non-significant values
  (random permutation test p > 0.05) were shown as blank.(B) Distribution of pathway
  activities in PBMC-MCs and BALF-MCs.(C) Heatmap shows expression of 1,526 metabolic
  genes in PBMC-MCs and BALF-MCs from different groups.(D and E) Trajectory (D) and
  inference (E) of pseudo time ordering of PBMC-MCs and paired BALF-MCs from mild
  patients visualized in the DDRTree-based reduced dimensional space.(F) Pearson correlation
  plot of metabolic scores and pseudo time in PBMC-MCs and paired BALF-MCs from patients
  with mild COVID-19.(G–I) Trajectory (G), inference of pseudo time ordering (H) and
  Pearson correlation analysis (I) of PBMC-MCs and paired BALF-MCs from patients with
  severe COVID-19.
