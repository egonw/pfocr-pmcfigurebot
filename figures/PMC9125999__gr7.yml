caption: COVID-19 pathway gene expression for OL-1, OL-2, and plC+R848Balloon plot
  of expression of genes taken from the Coronavirus disease – COVID-19 pathway in
  both Mf and DC cells. Only genes that have an adjusted p value < 0.1 (-log10 > 1)
  in either Mf or DC are shown. Size of the balloon denotes the log base 10 of the
  adjusted p value, with smaller p values having larger balloons. Color denotes expression
  level with blue having reduced expression compared to the control and red having
  increased. Black bars under the genes denote the function of the set of genes within
  the pathway. Cell type is split in each panel denoted by Mf and DC.
