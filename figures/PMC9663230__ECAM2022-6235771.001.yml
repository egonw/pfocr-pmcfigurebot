caption: 'TRIM44 is highly expressed in EC clinical tissues and EC cell lines. ((a),
  (b)) IHC analysis of TRIM44 in EC tissues. representative images of the immunohistochemical
  staining are shown. EC, endometrial carcinoma; P peritumoral normal tissue; (T)
  tumour. (c) Q–PCR analysis of TRIM44 in EC tissues (n = 35). (d) Western blot analysis
  of TRIM44 in EC tissue specimens (n = 10). (e) Q–PCR analysis of TRIM44 in EC cell
  lines. RNA samples were extracted from 3 EC cell lines (HEEC, HEC-1A, RL95-2, Ishikawa)
  for Q–PCR analysis of TRIM44 expression. HEECs served as a control. (f) Western
  blot analysis of TRIM44 in the cells of 3 EC cell lines is shown, and HEECs served
  as a control. all data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗, P < 0.01 compared with
  HEECs. HEECs: human endometrial epithelial cells; HEC-1A: human endometrial adenocarcinoma
  cells; RL95-2, Ishikawa: human endometrial carcinoma cell lines.'
