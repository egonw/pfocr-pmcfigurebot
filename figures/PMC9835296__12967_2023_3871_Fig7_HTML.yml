caption: AFAP1L1 interacts with VAV2 and activates CDC42 signaling to promote ITGA5
  expression. A The protein–protein interaction network of AFAP1L1 was constructed
  in STRING database (http://string-db.org). Among those interacted proteins, VAV2
  attracted our attention. B Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of the interaction
  between AFAP1L1 and VAV2 in AGS cells. C VAV2 knockdown and overexpression efficacy
  in indicated GC cells were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. D Active CDC42
  pull-down assays were performed to detect the level of active CDC42 in AFAP1L1-interfered
  GC cells with VAV2 further overexpression or knockdown. E The representative IHC
  images from serial sections of GC samples showed AFAP1L1 and active CDC42 expression
  in GC tissues with high or low AFAP1L1 expression. Scatter diagram of IHC staining
  scores showed the expression correlation between AFAP1L1 and active CDC42 in GC.
  Pearson correlation analysis was utilized to calculate correlation coefficient.
  F qRT-PCR analysis of ITGA5 and western blot analysis of ITGA5, FAK and ERK in AFAP1L1-interfered
  GC cells with VAV2 further overexpression or knockdown. ML141 (20 μm) was used to
  inhibit activation of CDC42 in MKN74AFAP1L1 cells. G Transwell invasion assays were
  performed to determine the role of VAV2 in mediating the influence of AFAP1L1 on
  GC cells invasive ability. ML141 (20 μm) was used to inhibit activation of CDC42
  in MKN74AFAP1L1 cells. Scale bars, 50 μm. n.s, no significance; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001
