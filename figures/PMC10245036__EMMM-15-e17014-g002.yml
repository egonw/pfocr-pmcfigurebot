figure_title: Effects of short‐term exposure to PM2.5 on cell viability and EGFR signaling
  in lung cancer cells
caption: Normal lung cells (IMR90 and MRC5) and lung cancer cells (A549 and H1975)
  were treated with various concentrations of PM2.5 for 24 h, and cell viability was
  assessed by a Trypan blue assay. The values are the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments.H1975 and A549 cells were treated with various concentrations of PM2.5
  for 24 h, and their cell lysates were analyzed for phosphor‐ERK (pERK), phosphor‐AKT
  (pAKT), phosphor‐STAT3 (pSTAT3), phosphor‐EGFR (pEGFR), ERK, AKT, STAT3, and EGFR
  by Western blotting. β‐actin served as the loading control. The results shown are
  from one of three similar experiments (left panel). The relative expression levels
  of pEGFR, pAKT, pSTAT3, and pERK were quantified by normalizing with β‐actin and
  are shown in the right panel. The values are the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *P < 0.05, as analyzed with one‐sample t‐test and compared with untreated
  cells.  Source data are available online for this figure.
