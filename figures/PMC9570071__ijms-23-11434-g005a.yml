caption: Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in zebrafish larvae caused by Cd2+ are mediated
  by Wnt signaling pathway. (A,B) Flow cytometry analysis and distribution of cell
  cycle phase of neurons and neuronal precursor cells. (C,D) Vertical view in the
  brain of AO-stained zebrafish larvae (6 dpf) and statistics of apoptotic cell numbers.
  (E) Relative expression analysis of genes related to cell apoptosis. In histograms,
  values are represented as mean ± SEM, while in boxplots, values are represented
  as median and mean, and whiskers signify 90% confidence interval. The results of
  nonparametric test and ANOVA, as well as multiple comparison test are listed in
  . “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
