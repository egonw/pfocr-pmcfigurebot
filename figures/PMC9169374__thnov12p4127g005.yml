caption: 'Exosomal EPHA2 promotes endothelial cell angiogenesis through AMPK signaling
  pathway. A KEGG enrichment analysis of the RNA-Seq data showed that the AMPK signaling
  pathway was significantly activated in EPHA2-rich exosomes treated HUVECs compared
  with control exosome treated cells. B The expression level of p-AMPK was significantly
  higher in the HM-Exos-treated endothelial cells than in the control and LM-Exos-treated
  cells, while the phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR and ERK were not altered. C
  Exosomes from EPHA2 stably silenced HM breast cancer cells failed to induce an upregulation
  of AMPK phosphorylation. D HM-Exos still induced an increase in AMPK phosphorylation
  in EPHA2-KD HUVECs compared with control cells. E HM-Exos failed to induce an upregulation
  of p-AMPK in Ephrin A1-KD HUVECs compared with control cells. F Compared with control
  cells, EPHA2-rich exosomes from HEK-293T cells could induce an increase in AMPK
  phosphorylation in EPHA2-KD HUVECs, but failed to induce an upregulation of phosphorylated
  AMPK in Ephrin A-KD HUVECs. G Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, significantly inhibited
  AMPK phosphorylation at a concentration of 10 μM; STO609, a CaMKKβ inhibitor, significantly
  inhibited AMPK phosphorylation at a concentration of 5μM. H Compound C and STO609
  eliminated phosphorylation of AMPK in HUVECs after incubation with HM-Exos. I Inhibition
  of AMPK signaling by Compound C and STO609 reduced tube-forming ability of HUVECs
  treated with HM-Exos. J Inhibition of AMPK signaling by Compound C and STO609 decreased
  the ability of microvascular outgrowth in HM-Exos-treated rat arterial rings. All
  experiments were repeated at least three times. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  and ns P > 0.05 indicate no statistical significance. Scale bar: 200 μm.'
