caption: 'Detailed reaction pathway of thermocatalytic and photocatalytic isopropanol
  dehydration on the surface of plasmonic W18O49, and schematic energetics of the
  reaction activation barrier (from step 2 to 3). Surface oxygen vacancies of W18O49-NWs
  can absorb H2O molecule to form OH as Brønsted acid sites. Step 1: The isopropanol
  molecule diffuses to the W18O49 surface to be absorbed isopropanol (Isopropanol*);
  Step 2: Isopropanol* is activated for the dehydration transition state with C–O
  bond cleavage and water molecule elimination; Step 3: Isopropanol is dehydrated
  to be absorbed H2O (H2O*) and propylene (Propylene*); Step 4: H2O* and Propylene*
  are released from the W18O49 surface. The blue cycle inset at right side shows full-spectrum-modulated
  plasmonic electron mechanism on W18O49. UV-excited electron transfer from the valence
  band (VB) to the defect band (DB), causing increased electron density and enhanced
  surface plasmon resonance (SPR), furthermore, the SPR is excited by Vis–NIR light
  generating hot electrons that can promote electron transfer during the isopropanol
  dehydration transition state.'
