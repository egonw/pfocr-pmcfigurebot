caption: 'Enrichment analysis of isoform switching events supports retinoic acid and
  TP53 signaling pathway targeting to inhibit EAC growth(A) Viability of adapalene-treated
  OE33 cells measured using Calcein-AM staining 48 and 72 h post-treatment with (B) representative
  fluorescent images of adapalene-treated Calcein-AM stained OE33 cells. (C) Viability
  of adapalene-treated JHAD1 cells assessed using Calcein-AM 48 and 72 h post-treatment
  with (D) representative fluorescent images of adapalene-treated stained JHAD1 cells.
  (E) Viability of OE33 cells treated with APR-246 at 48 and 72 h post-treatment with
  (F) representative fluorescent images of stained OE33 cells treated with APR-246.
  (G) Viability of JHAD1 cells treated with APR-246 at 48 and 72 h post-treatment
  with (H) representative fluorescent images of stained JHAD1 cells treated with APR-246.
  Significant differences of viability were assessed by ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc
  test for multiple comparisons between treatments. Within each time point, treatments
  were significantly different from a = vehicle (VEH), b = 1.0 μM adapalene or 10 μM
  APR-246, c = 1.5 μM adapalene or 20 μM APR-246, and d = 2.0 μM adapalene or 40 μM
  APR-246. Data are shown as mean ± standard error. Note: VEH-48h and VEH-72h images
  are the same in 5B and 5F because adapalene and APR-246 treatment of OE33 cells
  occurred in the same plate to permit direct comparisons. Similarly, VEH-48h and
  VEH-72h images are the same in 5D and 5H for JHAD1 cells. Scale bars, 500 μm.'
