caption: ARG inhibited the proliferation of SiHa and HeLa cells. (A) The 2D and 3D
  structure of ARG downloaded from https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/64981.
  (B–D) The cell viability of End1/E6E7, SiHa or HeLa cells was examined by CCK-8
  assays after cells were incubated with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 μM ARG for 24 h
  *P˂0.05 and **P˂0.01 vs. 0 μM ARG. (E) The cell viability of SiHa or HeLa cells
  was detected by CCK-8 assays after cells were hatched with 20 μM ARG for 24, 48
  and 72 h, respectively. **P˂0.01 and ***P˂0.001 vs. 0 h.
