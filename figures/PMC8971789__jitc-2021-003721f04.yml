caption: CD8 T cells and type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway plays a critical role in
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene (MAVS)-driven tumor growth suppression in
  vivo. (A) MC38 or MC38-MAVS cells (1×106 cells/site) were implanted into the flank
  of SCID-beige mice and growth monitored (N=5). (B) CT26.CL25 or CT26.CL25-MAVS cells
  (1×105 cells/site) were implanted as in (A) with doxycycline treated starting at
  day 0 (N=5). (C) MC38 or MC38-MAVS cells (1×106 cells/site) were implanted in mice
  with biweekly antibody injection to deplete CD8 T-cells (beginning on day 0; N=5).
  (D–F) CT26.CL25 or CT26.CL25-MAVS cells were engrafted into the flank of BALB/c
  mice (100k cells per mouse) with doxycycline administered at 1 week post implantation
  (all groups) and biweekly antibody injection to deplete CD8 T-cells (or isotype)
  beginning on day 0. (E) At 20 days post tumor injection, mice were sacrificed and
  splenocytes from engrafted mice in both the control group and MAVS group were assessed
  for tumor-specific (anti-LacZ) T cell responses by IFN-γ/ TNFα+intracellular flow
  cytometry (E) and IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay (F). (G) MC38 or
  MC38-MAVS cells (1×106 cells/site) were implanted in mice with IFN-α/β Receptor
  (IFNAR) antibody blockade. Biweekly antibody injection were started on the day of
  tumor cell injection and tumor volume were monitored biweekly as well (N=5). *,
