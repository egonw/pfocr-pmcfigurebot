caption: 'Boxplots displaying statistically significant differences in predicted metabolic
  pathways in the microbiome samples from the contents of the large intestine of mourning
  doves from the Seed and Urban diet groups: methanol oxidation to carbon dioxide
  (A), glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation (B), superpathway of UDP-glucose-derived
  O-antigen building blocks biosynthesis (C), and 2-methylcitrate cycle I (D). Pathway
  abundances were transformed by centered log-ratio (CLR) and statistical testing
  was performed via Mannâ€“Whitney U tests with a Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction.
  Boxes denote the interquartile range (IQR) between the first and third quartiles,
  and the horizontal line defines the median. *q value < 0.05.'
article_title: An urban diet differentially alters the gut microbiome and metabolomic
  profiles compared with a seed diet in mourning doves.
