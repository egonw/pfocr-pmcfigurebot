caption: Crosstalk Between the PI3K/AKT, NF-kappaB, and Cyclin D1-CDK4/6-pRb Pathways.
  (A) PI3K is a heterodimeric protein consisting of regulatory (p85) and catalytic
  (p110) components. The p85 regulatory subunit contains two SH2 groups. PI3K interacts
  with Ptdlns (–) P3 (PIP3) and the effector AKT. The activated TKD of HER2 receptor
  recruits PI3K towards the cell membrane and activates the p85 regulatory components
  (). The p110 catalytic component then in turn phosphorylates the PIP3 membrane phospholipid
  which recruits the plekstrin homology (PH) domain of the AKT protein. The activated
  PIP3 also binds to 3-phosphoinositol-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) allowing
  it to access and phosphorylate the Thr308 catalytic unit of AKT. The activated AKT
  then moves to the cell to activate a number of cellular processes stimulating cell
  growth and inhibiting cell apoptosis. One of the main roles is to phosphorylate
  and inhibit tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) subunits 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) and activate
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which in turn activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K)
  and ribosomal S6 to promote protein synthesis and cell growth (). (B) NF-kappaB
  can be activated by the classical canonical cascade starting from the cell surface
  receptor and by the alternative non-canonical cascade. The signal from the activated
  TKD of HER2 receptor is transferred into the cytoplasm and activates NF-kappaB by
  the classical canonical pathway (). The activation involves IKKalpha and IKKbeta
  catalytic subunits of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex which degrades the IkappaB
  inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB. As a result, the released NF-kappaB dimers translocate
  to the nucleus and activate the downstream gene transcription, producing cytokines
  (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5), chemokines (IL-8, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MCP-1),
  adhesion molecules, and other enzymes that lead to the influx of T-cells, B-cells,
  monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK-cells into the tumor. The dynamics of these tumor
  infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) will determine the aggressiveness and invasiveness
  of the cancer. It is well documented that cancers with higher percentage of TIL
  have a better response to treatment and survival outcome. (C) CDK4/6 interacts with
  cyclin D1 and inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein (pRb)
  to promote the transcription factor E2F1 to control cell cycle transition from G1
  to S phase (). The cyclinD1-CDK4/6 complex is also responsible for the phosphorylation
  of TSC 1 and 2, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of S6K and mTORC1, one
  of the downstream signal cascades of AKT.
