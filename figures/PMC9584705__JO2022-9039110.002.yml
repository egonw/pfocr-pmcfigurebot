caption: The mRNA and protein expression of RBP7 in breast cancer and the overall
  survival analysis with RBP7 mRNA expression. (a) Boxplot of the mRNA expression
  of RBP7 in normal and breast cancer tissues. (b) Boxplot of the protein expression
  of RBP7 in normal and breast cancer tissues. (c–f) Kaplan–Meier curve of OS based
  on the high and low expression of RBP7 in breast cancer patients from different
  databases. A log-rank p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
