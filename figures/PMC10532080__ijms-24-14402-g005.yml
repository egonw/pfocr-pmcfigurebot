caption: BAP31 regulates stemness through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A)
  Representative images of sphere formation assay of HCT116 and SW480 cells. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. (B) Western blot assay shows expression of BAP31, c-MYC, and SOX2 in
  HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with LiCl. (C) Relative mRNA expression of BAP31,
  c-MYC, and SOX2 in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with LiCl. β-actin was used as
  loading control. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
