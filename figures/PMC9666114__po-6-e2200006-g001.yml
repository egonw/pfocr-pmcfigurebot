caption: MP0274 mechanism of action inhibiting HER2 signaling. MP0274 binding to HER2
  inhibits HER2 signaling of the MAPK/AKT pathway and consequent proliferation, as
  well as of the PI3K pathway preventing induction of apoptosis. Dark blue and light
  gray represent phosphorylated and dephosphorylated signaling proteins, respectively.
  HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
