caption: 'Solamargine regulated CXCL3 expression which played a role in the metastasis
  of cervical cancer cells and the Erk pathway. (a) Wound healing assay was performed
  to evaluate the migration of cervical cancer cells after CXCL3 overexpression transfection
  and 24 h of 10 μM solamargine treatment (×100 magnification, scale bar = 100 μm).
  (b) Following cell migration detection, transwell assay was used to measure cell
  invasion (×250 magnification, scale bar = 50 μm). (c) After 10 μM solamargine treatment,
  the protein level of p-Erk1/2 and Erk1/2 in the transfected cells was determined
  by western blot. GAPDH served as the loading control. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs. control; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 vs. solamargine + NC. GAPDH,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CXCL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3;
  Erk, extracellular regulated protein kinases; p, phosphorylated; h, hours; NC, negative
  control.'
