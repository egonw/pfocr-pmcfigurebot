caption: The relative mRNA levels of the key enzymes in GSH-relative pathways. A Glutathione
  metabolic pathway diagram according to metabolome. B The relative mRNA levels of
  the ggt, gss, and gsr genes in DF-1 cells with or without IBDV infection. N = 3
  biological replicates and error bars represent s.d. Asterisks “*” presented the
  differences between the control group (without IBDV) and the experimental groups
  (with IBDV)
