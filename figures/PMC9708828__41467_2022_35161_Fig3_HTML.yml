figure_title: Engineering an efficient ER-localized ABA-inducible fast-release system
  through combinatory mutagenesis of C and N residues in CIDs to circumvent functionally
  detrimental PTMs
caption: a Structure depiction of the cytoplasmic and the ER-localized versions of
  ABI-ssTEVp1–118 and PYL1-ssTEVp119–245, annotated as Ic (pPW32), IER (pPW34), IIc
  (pPW33), and IIER (pPW35). A secretion signal (SS) was introduced into IER and IIER
  fusions. All constructs were tagged with FLAG for further analysis. b Immunoblotting
  against FLAG tag of HEK-293 cells transfected separately with the Ic, IER, IIc,
  or IIER following endo-H treatment of the total lysates. Actin was used as a loading
  control. c Site-directed mutagenesis of ER-localized ABI-ssTEVp1–118 and PYL1-ssTEVp119–245
  fusion proteins. SEAP levels in culture supernatants of HEK-293 cells transfected
  with 5 ng pMMH10, which encodes SEAP-TCS-KDEL (PhCMV-SEAP-TCS-KDEL-pA), in addition
  to 5 ng of different N to Q mutants of pMMH44 (PhCMV-SS-PYL1-ssTEVp119–245-KDEL-pAbGH)
  and pMMH45 (PhCMV-SS-ABI-(GGGGS)2-ssTEVp1–118-KDEL-pAbGH). Data are presented as
  mean ± SD of n = 6 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated
  using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. d Combinatory site-directed mutagenesis
  of ER-localized ABI-ssTEVp1–118, pMMH45. SEAP levels in culture supernatants of
  cells transfected with 5 ng pMMH10 in addition to 5 ng of different N to Q and/or
  C to S mutants of pMMH45 with non-mutagenized pMMH44WT. Data are presented as mean ± SD
  of n = 6 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed,
  unpaired Student’s t-test. e Dose-response analysis of pMMH45WT pMMH45N308Q, and
  pMMH45C29S, C102, N308Q mutants. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically
  independent samples. f SEAP levels in culture supernatants of HEK-293 cells transfected
  with pMMH10, pMMH44WT, and pMMH45C29S, C102, N308Q (5 ng each). At 24 h after transfection,
  the culture medium was replaced with 30 µl of fresh medium containing either DMSO
  or ABA (100 µM) and 20 µl aliquots were collected for analysis at different time
  points. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 5 biologically independent samples.
  ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. Source
  data are provided as a  file.
