caption: 'Influence of crosstalk between PPARγ and mTOR on the secretion of PGs in
  STCs under hormone treatment: Under hormone treatment, the mTOR pathway was first
  blocked, and then GW9662 was added for preconditioning. The culture medium supernatants
  were collected, and PGs were measured by ELISA, while RT-qPCR of the total RNA of
  the STCs was performed to determine the mRNA levels. (A) The relative mRNA level
  of the rate-limiting enzyme in PGs synthesis was quantified by RT-qPCR, with the
  β-actin gene used as the control in all samples. (B) Secretion of PGE2 and PGF2α
  was detected by ELISA, and the ratio of PGE2/PGF2α was calculated. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Different letters above the bars
  indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).'
