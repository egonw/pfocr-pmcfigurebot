caption: BLACAT2 overexpression enhances MER/ERK signaling in uterine corpus endometrial
  carcinoma cells. Expression of the protein markers in the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  were next analyzed in AN3CA cells with stably overexpressed BLACAT2 and in HEC-1-A
  cells with stably knocked down BLACAT2. (A) Representative images of western blot
  analysis of p-MEK1/2, total MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2 both in AN3CA cells,
  (B) which were semi-quantified. (C) Representative images of western blot analysis
  of p-MEK1/2, total MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2 both in HEC-1-A cells, (D)
  which were semi-quantified. Values are presented as the means ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05
  and **P<0.01 vs. Lv-NC or Lv-shNC. BLACAT2, bladder cancer-associated transcript
  2; p-, phosphorylated; Lv, lentivirus; sh, short-interfering; NC, negative control.
