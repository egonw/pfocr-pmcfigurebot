caption: Biochemical model of interactions of Toll and Imd pathways in D. melanogaster
  as a response to microbial infection. The immune response in D. melanogaster involves
  the activation or inhibition of multiple pathways, such as RAS/MAPK, JNK, or JAK/STAT.
  The observed expression change corresponding to the experiment conditions and mutants
  is shown in blue (upregulation) or red (downregulation). With orange-filled or orange-bordered
  squares, we indicate that the respective gene significantly varies its expression
  in infected and uninfected γCOP14a/γCOP14a males. With green-filled or green-bordered
  triangles we indicate a gene that significantly varies its expression in infected
  and, respectively, uninfected γCOPS057302/TM6B males. Unmarked components of the
  pathway did not show any statistically significant expression change. Created with
