caption: 'Overview: Role of SGK1 in biology. (A) Upon the aldosterone binding, cytosolic
  MR translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of SGK1 in renal
  epithelial cells. Concurrently, growth factors, such as insulin, activate PDK1,
  which then phosphorylates SGK1. Phosphorylated SGK1 inhibits NEDD4-2-mediated ubiquitination,
  which prevents the degradation of ENaC subunit. Additionally, SGK1 affects the function
  of ENaC in NEDD4-2 independent pathways. SGK1 directly phosphorylates ENaC α subunit
  to trigger channel activity. Moreover, SGK1 impedes a negative regulator of ENaC,
  WNK4, by which ENaC remains active for sodium reabsorption. Lastly, SGK1 promotes
  ENaC α transcription through restricting the formation of histone methyltransferase,
  AF9-Dot1a complex. (B) Upon growth factor-mediated stimulation, PI3K activates PDK1
  and mTORC2, which in turn phosphorylates SGK1 in cancer cells. The enzymatic function
  of SGK1 turns on several target genes, such as NDRG1, FOXO3, and mTORC1, enhancing
  the cellular processes that facilitate cancer progression. (C) During Th17 differentiation,
  sodium exposure promotes NFAT5 and SGK1 activation. The enzymatic function of SGK1
  hinders FOXO1 activity, which relieves RORγt from FOXO1-mediated inhibition. Subsequently,
  RORγt facilitates the expression of IL-23R, contributing to the enhancement of IL-23
  signaling. As a positive feedback regulation, IL-23 promotes the SGK1-RORγt signaling
  pathway, resulting in the expression of pathogenic cytokines. ENaC, epithelial sodium
