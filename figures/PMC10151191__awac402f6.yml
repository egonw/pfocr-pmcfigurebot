caption: 'Downregulating NRG1-type III/ERBB2/3 signalling using niacin reduces myelination
  defects both in vitro and in vivo. (A and B) Niacin treatment reduces significantly
  myelin abnormalities in Fgd4SC–/– co-cultures. Fgd4SC–/– co-cultures were treated
  every 2 days with niacin (5mM) concomitantly to ascorbic acid addition (50 µM) over
  12 days. (A) Quantification of the myelin abnormalities. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SEM (n = 3 co-cultures) and normalized to the control values. Statistical analysis:
  unpaired Student’s t-test. (B) Examples of MBP immunostaining in Fgd4SC–/– co-cultures
  treated (right) or non-treated (left) with niacin. Examples of myelin abnormalities
  are indicated by asterisks (*outfolding, **tomacula). (C and D) Niacin treatment
  leads to a downregulation of the NRG1-type III/ERBB2/3 signalling pathway. P-ERBB2
  and ERBB2 expression levels were assessed by western blot in non-treated and niacin-treated
  Fgd4SC–/– co-cultures. (C) Quantification of P-ERBB2 and ERBB2 protein levels. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3 co-cultures). Statistical analysis: unpaired
  Student’s t-test. (D) Western blot pictures illustrating the expression of the markers
  described in C. (E and F) Niacin treatment reduces the proportion of abnormal myelin
  fibres in vivo. One-month-old Fgd4SC–/– mice were daily injected with saline solution
  or niacin (60 mg/kg) over 8 weeks. Myelin abnormalities were quantified in the distal
  part of the sciatic nerves of the mice. (E) Quantification of the myelin abnormalities
  in sciatic nerves of treated and non-treated Fgd4SC–/– mice. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 4 saline-treated animals and 5 niacin-treated animals). Statistical
  analysis: unpaired Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (F) Electron
  microscopy pictures illustrating myelination of sciatic nerves of saline-treated
  (left) and niacin-treated Fgd4SC–/– (right) mouse. Asterisks indicate outfoldings.
