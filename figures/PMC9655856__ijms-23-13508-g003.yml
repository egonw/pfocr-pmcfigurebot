caption: 'IQGAP2 did not influence cell apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. (A) Cell
  apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry in IQGAP-overexpressing (IQGAP_EX) T24
  and control cells (empty vector—EV). (B) Cell apoptosis markers Caspase 3 and BCL2
  showed no different mRNA expression in T24 IQGAP2_EX and Control_EV. One example
  of replicates is shown; bar chart presents the means of replicates ± SEM from three
  different experiments; # indicates p > 0.05; Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired)
  was used for comparison of means.'
