figure_title: CFTR regulates platelet aggregation through the P2Y12 and PAR4 signaling
  pathway
caption: a Surface expression of CD41, CD61, and CD42b in CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets
  were detected using flow cytometry, and the values were expressed as mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) (n = 6–9 mice per group; unpaired t test). b Western blot analysis
  of GPVI expression in CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets (n = 6 mice per group; unpaired
  t test). c Western blot analysis of P2Y12 expression in CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets
  (n = 8 mice per group; unpaired t test). d Western blot analysis of PAR4 expression
  in CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets (n = 8 mice per group; unpaired t test). e qRT-PCR
  analysis of P2Y1 and TP mRNA expression in CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets (n = 5 mice
  per group; unpaired t test). f, Western blot analysis of P2Y12 expression in CftrPOE
  and Ctrl platelets (n = 8 mice per group; unpaired t test). g Western blot analysis
  of PAR4 expression in CftrPOE and Ctrl platelets (n = 6 mice per group; unpaired
  t test). h Western blot analysis of GPVI expression in CftrPOE and Ctrl platelets
  (n = 6 mice per group; unpaired t test). i qRT-PCR analysis of P2Y1 and TP mRNA
  expression in CftrPOE and Ctrl platelets (n = 5 mice per group; unpaired t test).
  j–m, Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated PI3K and Akt protein expression
  in CftrPKO (j–k), CftrPOE (l, m), and their age-matched Ctrl platelets (n = 6 mice
  per group; unpaired t test). Data are presented as mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant.
