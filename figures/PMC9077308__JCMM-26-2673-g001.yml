caption: Function in proliferation and migration of TRIP13 and its regulated change
  of AKT pathway in breast cancer (BC) cell. (A) Western blot analysis showed changing
  of PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR signalling pathway in BC cell. (B) Effects of TRIP13 knockdown
  on BC cell proliferation were determined by colony formation assay. (C) Effects
  of TRIP13 knockdown on BC cell migration were determined by Transwell assay. (D)
  Effects of TRIP13 knockdown on BC cell migration were determined by Wound healing
  assay. *p‐Value <0.05; ** p‐value <0.01; *** p‐value <0.001
article_title: Evaluation of the TRIP13 level in breast cancer and insights into potential
  molecular pathways.
