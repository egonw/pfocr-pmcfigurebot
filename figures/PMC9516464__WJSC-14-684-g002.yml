caption: 'The developed strategies to improve the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
  in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease include combined treatment with conventional
  drugs, pretreatment and gene modification. The tested pretreatments include bioactive
  factors, hypoxia and medium modification. The conventional drugs include biological
  preparations of mesalazine, budesonide, beclomethasone, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole,
  6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, infliximab and adalimumab. For example, the combination
  of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the drug sulfadiazine inhibits the nuclear
  factor-kappaB pathway, reduces Bax expression, prevents loss of the B cell lymphoma-2
  protein, reduces the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and CXCL9, increases
  the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and Arg-1, and transforms inflammatory M1 macrophages
  into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Pretreatment with IL-25 and IL-1β enhances
  the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs. MSCs pretreated with Toll-like receptor
  3 (TLR3) for a short time in vitro produce prostaglandin E2 through the TLR3-Jagged-1-Notch-1
  pathway. In response to hypoxia, the levels of IL-11, soluble vascular cell adhesion
  protein-1 and stromal cell-derived factor-1α are significantly upregulated. MSCs
  have also been pretreated by modifying the culture medium, such as the addition
  of fibroblast growth factor, all-trans retinoic acid and modified neuronal medium.
  In addition, genetically modified MSCs have been developed. These methods and strategies
  potentially improve the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs by promoting their homing
  and differentiation abilities. PGE2: Prostaglandin E2; MSCs: Mesenchymal stem cells;
