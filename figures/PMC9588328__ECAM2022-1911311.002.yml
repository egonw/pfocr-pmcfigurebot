caption: 'PFGS combined with Sor inhibited proliferation and triggered apoptosis in
  H22 tumor-bearing mice in vivo. (a) Immunostaining indicated that PFGS combined
  with Sor treatment markedly decreased the expression of Ki-67 (n = 3). (b) TUNEL
  staining showed that PFGS combined with Sor treatment increased the number of apoptotic
  cells in the tumor compared to the control group (n = 3). Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 compared with the control group; ∗∗p < 0.01 compared with
  the control group; ##p < 0.01 compared with the Sor group.'
