caption: Immune characteristics of different subtypes. (A) TCGA-PAAD molecular subtypes
  varied in the differences of 22 immune cell scores; (B) TCGA-PAAD molecular subtypes
  varied in the differences of ESTIMATE immune infiltration; (C) PACA-AU molecular
  subtypes varied in the differences of 22 immune cell scores; (D) PACA-AU molecular
  subtypes varied in the differences of ESTIMATE in immune infiltration; (E) TCGA-PAAD
  molecular subtypes varied in the differences of scores of seven inflammation-related
  gene clusters; (F) TCGA-PAAD molecular subtypes varied in the differences of ferroptosis
  pathway; (G) TCGA-PAAD molecular subtypes varied in the differences in scores of
  autophagy pathway; (H) TCGA-PAAD molecular subtypes varied in the differences in
  scores of angiogenesis-related genes; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; and ****p
  < 0.0001.
