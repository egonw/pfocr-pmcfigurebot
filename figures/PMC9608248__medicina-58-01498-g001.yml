caption: mRNA expression of genes targeted by the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway (DUSP5, DUSP6,
  FOS, BIRC5, and MCL1) and genes not directly targeted by the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway
  (BCL2, BCL2L10, CCL26 and VAT1) as controls in representative colorectal cancer
  cell lines with (left panel) and without (right panel) mutations in BRAF. BRAF mutated
  cell lines with coexisting PIK3CA mutations are shown with an asterisk.

  Lines with or without PIK3CA Mutations for Discovery of Vulnerabilities with Therapeutic
  Potential.
