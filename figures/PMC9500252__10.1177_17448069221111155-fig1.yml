caption: Armadillo has at least two distinct cellular functions. When Wnt/Wg pathway
  is off, the destruction complex prevents accumulation of Arm (Armadillo) by proteolysis.
  When the Wnt/Wg pathway is on, inactivation of the destruction complex allows Arm
  to accumulate, enter the nucleus, and activate expression of the Wnt/Wg response
  genes. Arm is also known to play a role in cell adhesion, where it binds to cadherin
  at the plasma membrane of the cell.
