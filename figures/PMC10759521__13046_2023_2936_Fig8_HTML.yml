caption: Inhibition of p53 could attenuate the effect of DCAF13 in A549 and SPC-A1
  cells. (A) Protein expression of p53, p21, BAX, FAS were analyzed by Western blotting
  in A549 or SPC-A1 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. GAPDH was used as
  a control. (B) Cell clone formation experiments were performed in A549 and SPC-A1
  cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. (C) CCK-8 experiments were performed
  in A549 and SPC-A1 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. (D) Cell migration
  experiments were performed in A549 and SPC-A1 cells transfected with the indicated
  siRNAs. (E) Flow cytometry was used to analyze the apoptosis rates in A549 and SPC-A1
  cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. (F) Association between DCAF13 mRNA
  expression and prognosis in p53 wild-type or mutant type TCGA LUAD samples by Kaplan-Meier
  analysis. Student’s t-test was used in Fig. 8B-E. Data presented as mean ± SD, n = 3,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. Scale bar = 100 μm
