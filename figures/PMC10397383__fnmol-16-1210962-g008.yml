caption: JNK pathway inhibition reduces neuronal death induced by K5. Seven DIV CGN
  cultured in K25 medium were switched to low potassium medium (K5) and treated with
  the JNK inhibitor SP600125 at a concentration ranging from 40 nM to 5 mM. Neuronal
  viability was measured after 24 h by using calcein and propidium iodide (PI) dyes
  as detailed in Methods. The panel shows representative micrographs for each condition.
  Graphs show cell viability expressed as the percentage of calcein (living cells)
  or PI (dead cells) positive cells from total cells (calcein plus PI-positive cells)
  Arrows in the K5 24h condition represent axonal degeneration. Bars represent the
  means and the distribution of independent experiments. Three independent experiments
  with two repetitions of each one were done. *p < 0.033, **p < 0.002, ***p < 0.001,
  significantly different from K5 24 h. Data were analyzed with One way ANOVA followed
  by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The bar in the panels represents 50 μm.
