caption: Future therapies targeting the PDGF pathway in PAH patients. Most of tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors (TKI) are non-specific and target several tyrosine kinase receptors.
  Imatinib treatment of iPAH patients showed some beneficial effects but raised safety
  concerns. New TKI with various specificities are being tested and could provide
  improvement with less adverse effects. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing
  to test the efficacy and safety of low doses of Imatinib administered by nebulization.
  TKI could also be encapsulated in different nanoparticles (liposomes, dendrimers,
  magnetic nanoparticlesâ€¦) to target the lung. Other future therapies could involve
  molecules which could specifically target only one member of the PDGFR/PDGF family.
  Blocking antibodies are now being tested in different pathologies and could therefore
  be evaluated in PAH patients. Soluble truncated receptors can also serve as decoy
  receptors for PDGF. Other nucleotidic therapeutic molecules are also being developed.
  Aptamers are RNA molecules which can bind and inhibit proteins. Antisense oligonucleotides
  (DNA, siRNA and miRNA) are also a new avenue for disease treatment that could help
  reduce PDGF signaling during PAH. TKI, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; siRNA, short inhibitory
  RNA; miRNA, microRNA.
