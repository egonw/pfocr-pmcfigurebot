caption: The response of Model-1 to optic flow sequences. The response of OFNW to
  (A) Anti-clockwise sequence, (B) clockwise sequence, (C) zooms out or radially outward
  sequence, and (D) zoom in or radially inward sequence. In each case, “DSMN Resp”
  represents the populations of neurons that are active in each tile of DSMN. “CPNW
  Resp” represents the subset of neurons that are active in each cell-plane in response
  to the given optic flow stimulus. The responses on eight cell-planes are arranged
  as a 1D vector before giving it to OFNW. OFNW is a four-class perceptron made up
  of two layers (input and output), and its response to four types of optic flow patterns
  is shown as OFNW Resp.
