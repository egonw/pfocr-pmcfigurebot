caption: Cell-to-cell communications of GALECTIN family signaling pathways among the
  distinct immune cells in the PBMC between RA group and HC group predicted by the
  CellChat software. (A) Chord plots showing the interactions of ligand/receptor pair
  LGALS9–CD45 between RA group and HC group. (B) Circle plots summarizing the interactions
  of GALECTIN signaling pathway among individual cell types in both RA and HC group.
  (C) Heat map showing the relative contribution of each cell type based on the computed
  four-network centrality measures of GALECTIN signaling network between RA and HC
  groups. (D) Violin plots showing the expression levels of GALECTIN family cytokines
  in each immune cell type for both RA and HC groups.
