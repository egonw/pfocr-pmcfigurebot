caption: Expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 in human primary GC tissues. (A) Flow diagram
  presenting the study scheme using human primary tumors of GC patients who were treated
  with neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation following as curative resection. (B)
  The proportion of p-STAT3-positive cancer cells in immunohistochemistry for primary
  GC tumors according to the responsiveness for neoadjuvant therapy. Representative
  image (magnification, Ã—200) for p-STAT staining and table showing the association
  between clinicopathological factors and the responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy.
  These data were analyzed using the Chi-squared test. (C) Flow diagram presenting
  the study scheme using the public transcriptome dataset (GES62254) for human primary
  samples. (D) The correlation between STAT3 pathway gene set and stromal gene score,
  CCL2, CXCL1, IL-6, and CXCL8 expression in GSE62254 dataset. (E) Survival differences
  according to the expression of STAT3 pathway gene set in the GSE62254 dataset. CCL2,
  C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; GC, gastric cancer; IL-6, interleukin-6; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3.
