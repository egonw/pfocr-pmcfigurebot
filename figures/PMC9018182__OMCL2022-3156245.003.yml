caption: Potential regulatory role of chondrocyte Kindlin-2 in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  in the direct contact coculture system. (a) Representative upregulated KEGG pathway
  categories affected by coculturing with BMSCs. (b) Altered protein expression levels
  of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR, Col2, and aggrecan were detected using Western
  blotting in Kindlin-2 knockdown and overexpression chondrocytes in the direct contact
  coculture system. (c) Immunoblot images showing the effect of Kindlin-2 knockdown
  or overexpression on the expression of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR in
  chondrocytes without coculturing. (d) Protein expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K,
  p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR, Col2, and aggrecan were detected using Western blotting
  in Kindlin-2 knockdown and overexpression chondrocytes in the direct contact coculture
  system or Kindlin-2 sh-NC chondrocytes treated with LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K)
  before coculture. (e) Protein expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR,
  Col2, and aggrecan were detected using Western blotting in Kindlin-2 knockdown and
  overexpression chondrocytes in the direct contact coculture system or Kindlin-2
  overexpression chondrocytes treated with LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K) before
  coculture.
