caption: 'Effect of TCS on transcription and translation of apoptosis and autophagy
  associated markers in Neuro-2a cells. The cells were treated with DMSO (control),
  0.2 µM temsirolimus (positive control), and TCS (10, 30 and 50 µM) for 24 h. (a)
  Bar graph illustrating RT-qPCR analysis for the relative quantification of mRNA
  expression of respective genes. (b) Representative expression pattern of autophagy
  related proteins (ATG7, LC3B and p62) as determined by immunoblot analysis. β-Actin
  was used as internal control in all analyses. The bar graphs in (a) and (b) represents
  fold change in expression as compared to vehicle treated control cells in respective
  groups. Results are representative of three independent experiments with mean ± SEM.
  * and # indicate p < 0.05 as compared to vehicle and temsirolimus treated cells,
  respectively for respective genes or proteins. TCS, triclosan; Tem, temsirolimus.'
