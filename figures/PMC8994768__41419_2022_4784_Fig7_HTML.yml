figure_title: SV increased Prox1 expression in granule cells of APP mice
caption: The white box in the top right panel shows the confocal scanning area for
  Prox1 immunofluorescence staining in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Prox1
  protein levels were drastically reduced in granule cells from APP mice compared
  to WT controls. Although SV treatment (timeline shown on top of bar graph) significantly
  increased Prox1 levels in treated APP mice, they still remained significantly lower
  than those of WT mice. (n = 4–5 mice/group) ***p < 0.001, using two-way ANOVA followed
  by Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. Scale bar = 75 µm.
