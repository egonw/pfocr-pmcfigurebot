caption: Transcriptome analysis in livers of IVF-ET male offspring. A. Volcano plots
  show significantly altered genes. Rgs16 and Gdf15 are highlighted; B. Heat map of
  differential genes associated with lipid metabolism; C. Enrichment map of genes
  involved in pathways related to fatty acid metabolism; D. Enrichment map of genes
  involved in pathways related to unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. E. mRNA levels
  of genes related to the fatty acid synthesis pathway in liver tissue; F. mRNA levels
  of genes related to the fatty acid oxidation pathway in liver tissue. GSEA, Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis; NES, Normalized Enrichment Score; GO, Gene Ontology; BP,
  Biological Process; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia Of Genes And Genomes. For bar graphs,
  data represent mean Â± SEM. *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; ns, not
  significant.
