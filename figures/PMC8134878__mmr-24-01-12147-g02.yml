caption: LY-294002 enhances oxaliplatin induced cytotoxicity by blocking the PI3K/mTOR/S6K1/4EBP1
  signaling pathway in HepG2R cells. (A and B) Treatment of HepG2R cells with oxaliplatin,
  LY-294002, or LY-294002 combined with oxaliplatin for 24 h. Direct effector response
  (S6K1 and eIF4EBP1) downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway was illustrated. Cell lysates
  were collected, and the designated proteins were detected using western blotting.
  (C and D) Representative images of the colony formation assay in HepG2R cells. **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001. OXA, oxaliplatin; p-, phosphorylated; R, resistant; eIF4EBP1, eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1.
