caption: Overexpression of KAT5 leads to enhancement of inflammatory response in EAC
  mice. (A–G) The EAC mouse model was established followed by the indicated treatment.
  (A–C) The eosinophilic infiltration was analyzed by hematoxylin & eosin staining.
  (D and E) The expression of Eotaxin and RANTES was measured by qPCR. (F) The levels
  of IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, and IL-10 were detected by ELISA. (G) CD11c+ dendritic cells
  and CD4+ T cells infiltration in the conjunctiva were analyzed by fluorescence staining.
  **P < 0.01.
