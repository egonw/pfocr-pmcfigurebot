caption: 'Four doses of Carfilzomib led to decreased diuresis and to metabolic alterations
  in the kidneys, plasma, and urine in vivo. Graphs of metabolic parameters assessed
  in the metabolic cages after 24 h: (A) body weight (g) change (Δ body weight), (B)
  food intake/body weight, (C) feces weight/body weight, (D) water intake (ml)/body
  weight(g), (E) urine protein excretion (g/24 h) and (F) urine volume (mL)/body weight(g)
  (n = 6 per group). (G) Three-dimensional representation of principal components
  analysis (PCA) of the proteomic analysis of the kidney’s urine and plasma (n = 6
  per group) and (H) metabolite enrichment overview of the top 25 metabolic pathways
  as emerged from the metabolomic analysis and MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software with enrichment
  and P value ascension. Blue scatter bars refer to the Control and red scatter bars
  refer to Cfz groups. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Student’s T-Test, unpaired,
  2-tailed. ***P < 0.005, ****P < 0.001.'
