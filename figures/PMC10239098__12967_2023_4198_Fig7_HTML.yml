caption: DPSC-Exos alleviated IFN-γ-caused AQP5 downregulation in salivary gland epithelial
  cells (SGEC) via GPER mediated cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway. A–E Western blot analysis
  AQP5, GPER, p-PKA, and p-CREB in SGEC. F The cAMP concentration in SGEC lysate was
  detected by ELISA. G The intracellular Ca2+ level of SGEC was measured by flow cytometry.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3. Significant effect of the treatment,
