caption: (A, B) Effect of intermittent fasting, starvation, exercise and honey on
  glucose‐6‐phosphatase (G6Pase) (a), fructose‐1,6 biphosphatase (F1,6BPase) (b),
  hexokinase (HKase) (c) and pyruvate kinase (PKase) (d) activities in naïve male
  Wistar rats. Bars represent mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6) (one‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post hoc test). (A) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 relative to controls. bp < 0.05
  relative to intermittent fasting group; cp < 0.05 relative to exercise group. dp < 0.05,
  ddp < 0.01 relative to honey group. (B) ****p < 0.0001 relative to controls. aap < 0.01,
  aaaap < 0.001 relative to diabetic group. bp < 0.05 relative to intermittent fasting
  group; cp < 0.05 relative to exercise group. dp < 0.05, ddp < 0.01, ddddp < 0.0001
  relative to honey group
