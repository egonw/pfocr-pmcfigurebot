caption: 'Effect of miR-372-3p KD on angiogenesis. (a) Immunofluorescence staining
  of α-SMA and CD31 was performed to examine the neovascularization in myocardial
  tissue sections. (b) Statistical analysis was performed to show the relative amount
  of new blood vessels in myocardial tissue sections. Bar: 50 μM; data were presented
  as means ± SEM. n = 7/group, ∗∗P < 0.01: model group vs. miR-372-3p KD group.'

  by Accelerating Angiogenesis via Activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α Signaling Pathway
  and Suppressing Oxidative Stress.
