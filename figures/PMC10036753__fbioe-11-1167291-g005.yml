caption: 'Evaluation of transintestinal penetration of drug using rat intestines co-treated
  with FAM-NP tablet (Rp.9 formulations) and endocytosis inhibitors. Penetration profile
  (A) and AUC 0–6h(B) of FAM in the FAM-NP tablet under cold (4°C) and normal (37°C)
  conditions. Penetration profile (C) and AUC 0–6h(D) of FAM in the rat intestines
  co-treated with FAM-NP tablet and endocytosis inhibitors [vehicle (0.5% DMSO), nystatin,
  dynasore, rottlerin, cytochalasin D]. n = 6–9. *p < 0.05°C vs. 37°C for each category.
  #p < 0.05 vs. the vehicle for each category. The intestinal penetration of the FAM-NP
  tablet was attenuated by the inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, dynasore.'
article_title: Orally disintegrating tablets containing famotidine nanoparticles provide
  high intestinal absorbability via the energy-dependent endocytosis pathway.
