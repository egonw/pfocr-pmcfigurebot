caption: 'PBX3 enhances PPP in a p53-independent manner. A-B. G6PD protein expression
  level in PBX3-knocked down (A) and PBX3-overexpressed (B) HCT116p53null cells, as
  determined using western blotting. C-D. G6PD enzymatic activity in PBX3-knocked
  down (C) and PBX3-overexpressed (D) HCT116p53null cells. E-F. Intracellular NADPH/NADP+
  ratio in PBX3-knocked down (E) and PBX3-overexpressed (F) HCT116p53null cells. G.
  Intracellular ROS level in PBX3-knocked down HCT116p53null cells. Representative
  images (left) and quantification results (right) are shown. H. Percentage of apoptotic
  cells in PBX3-knocked down HCT116p53null cells, as examined using Annexin V/PI staining
  and flow cytometry. I. Lipid accumulation in PBX3-knocked down HCT116p53null cells,
  as examined using Nile red staining. Representative images (left) and quantification
  results (right; n = 6) are shown. J. Proliferation potential of PBX3-knocked down
  HCT116p53null cells, as examined using EdU-incorporation assay. Representative images
  (left) and quantification results (right; n = 6) are shown. K-L. Viability (K) and
  colony formation potential (L; n = 6) of PBX3-knocked down HCT116p53null cells.
  M. Viability of PBX3-knocked down HCT116p53null cells cultured in the presence of
  Nuc and/or Nac, as measured on the third day after the addition of Nuc and/or Nac.
  Cells transfected with shCon or pcCon were used as control. β-actin was used as
  western blotting loading control. Total protein was used for normalizing G6PD enzymatic
  activity and NADPH/NADP+ level. Scale bars: 200 μm. Quantification data are shown
  as mean ± SD (n = 3; unless otherwise indicated). pcCon: pcEF9-Puro; *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01.'
