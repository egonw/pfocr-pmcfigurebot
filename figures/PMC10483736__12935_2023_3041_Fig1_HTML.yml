caption: 'Schematic description of the shelterin complex. Telomeres end with a G-strand
  3’ overhang that invades the double-stranded telomeric sequence. A closed structure
  called telomere loop (T-loop) is formed. The shelterin complex coordinates the T-loop
  formation and protects the end of the chromosome from damage. Telomeric Repeat Factor
  1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2) bind to double strand (ds) DNA and form two separate complexes
  with other proteins. Protection of telomeres protein 1 (POT1) recognizes single-stranded
  DNA while Repressor/activator protein 1 (RAP1) binds to DNA at the ds-ss joint.
  TRF1- and TRF2-Interacting Nuclear Protein 2 (TIN2) binds TRF1 and TRF2 spontaneously
  and protects TRF1 from being degraded. TINT1/PTOP/PIP1 protein (TPP1) and POT1 form
  a heterodimer. TPP1 also links TIN2 and POT1 and recruits telomerase (TERT) with
  its telomerase RNA component (TR) to the shelterin complex. TPP1 contains two telomerase
  binding regions. The CST complex has three components: conserved telomere protection
  component 1 (CTC1), suppressor of cdc thirteen 1 (STN1) and telomeric pathway with
  STN1 (TEN1), which are thought to function in telomere lagging-strand synthesis.
  The CST complex binds to newly synthesized repeats and blocks telomerase activity'
