caption: DDX3X expression in Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cells. (A) The protein
  level of Casp‐3 and cleaved Casp‐3 in H9c2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) for 0,
  6, 12, and 24 h were detected by Western blot. The data are presented as means ± SEM.
  ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; ***p < 0.001. (B) The apoptosis ratio of
  H9c2 cardiomyocytes was measured by flow cytometric analysis. The data are presented
  as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05. (C) The mRNA expression of DDX3X in H9C2 cardiomyocytes
  treated by Dox (2 μM) for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h were detected by RT‐qPCR. The data
  are presented as means ± SEM. ***p < 0.001. (D) The protein level of DDX3X in H9C2
  cardiomyocytes stimulated by Dox (2 μM) for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. The data are presented
  as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; **p < 0.01
