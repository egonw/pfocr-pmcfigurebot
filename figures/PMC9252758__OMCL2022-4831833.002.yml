caption: 'Illustration of mTOR signaling and tumor relationship. Mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTORC1) expression is regulated by mTORC2 through Akt/TSC1/2/Rheb
  signaling pathway that leads to overactivation of mTORC1 and finally results in
  proliferation and metastasis and encourages tumor formation. In given figure, mutation
  in cell and extracellular growth signals activate mTORC1 that results in phosphorylation
  of RNF168 and ubiquitination of H2AFX and H2AX (histone). Overall, the pathway end
  ups with DNA damage that leads to tumor formation (tumorigenesis). Similarly, mTORC2
  activates Akt signaling that promotes binding of Rheb to TSC1/2. It leads to ubiquitination
  of Rheb, and its activity is reduced. Finally, reduction in Rheb downregulation
  takes place that triggers mTORC1 activation and inhibits tumor growth. MMP-9 and
  B7-H1 is upregulated through the mTOR signaling pathway after activation of mTORC1
  and results in cancer metastasis and invasion. Abbreviations: mTORC1: mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2: mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2;
  Akt: serine/threonine-protein kinase; TSC1/2: tuberous sclerosis 1and 2; Rheb: Ras
  homolog enriched in brain; H2AFX, MMP-9: matrix metalloproteinaseâ€“9.'
