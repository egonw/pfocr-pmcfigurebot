caption: 'Naringenin effectively attenuated renal I/R-generated ER stress and activated
  Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in mice. (a–c) qRT-PCR authenticated that pretreatment
  of naringenin effectively reduced the mRNA expression of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12
  induced by renal I/R surgery. (d, e) Western blot analysis proved that naringenin
  administration downregulated ER stress-related proteins including GRP78, CHOP, and
  caspase-12 during renal I/R injury. (f, g) The protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in
  renal tissues were displayed through western blot analysis in C57Bl/6 mice. Values
  measured during animal experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3 (three times
  measurements). ∗P < 0.05, compared with the Sham group; #P < 0.05, relative to the
  NS+I/R group.'
