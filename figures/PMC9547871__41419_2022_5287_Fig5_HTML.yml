figure_title: Inhibition of p38 MAPK can reverse the cytoprotective effects of IFNγ
caption: a Block on p38 MAPK pathway abolishes the stimulating effects of IFNγ in
  CLL cells. Primary cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) obtained from 10 patients with CLL were
  treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) and 100 ng/mL IFNγ alone and in combination
  with 50 µM BIRB796 or 50 µM SB203580 for 24 h. The metabolic activity of cells was
  determined using the PrestoBlue assay. Data are means ± SEM of ≥ three independent
  experiments, carried out in duplicate. One-way ANOVA (post hoc Dunnett); *, **,
  ***, and **** denote p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, and p < 0.0001; b Inhibition
  of p38 MAPK reverses IFNγ-mediated resistance of primary CLL cells to venetoclax.
  CLL cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) from six patients with CLL were treated with 0.1% DMSO
  (vehicle control), 1 nM venetoclax, 50 µM BIRB796, 100 ng/mL IFNγ, and their combinations
  for 24 h. The metabolic activity of cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay.
  Data are means ± SEM of ≥ three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate.
  Two-way ANOVA (post hoc Tukey); *, denotes p < 0.05; c IFNγ activates the p38 MAPK
  pathway in primary CLL cells. Cells (2 × 106 cells/mL) from five patient with CLL
  were left untreated (control) or were treated with 100 ng/mL IFNγ for 1 h. Then,
  the cells were lysed, and whole cells lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE and blotted
  to nitrocellulose membranes. The ratio p-p38 MAPK/p38 MAPK (left) and immunoblots
  (right) for phosphorylated and total forms of p38 MAPK are shown. GAPDH was used
  as the loading control. Data are means ± SEM of five independent experiments.
