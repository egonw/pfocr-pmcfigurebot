caption: Off-target effects of statins. Statins act at different levels in skeletal
  muscle cells. First, they provoke the increased release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum to the cytoplasm and perturb the contractility of muscle fibers. In parallel,
  statins impair mitochondrial function, leading to the accumulation of ROS and to
  the activation of apoptosis. Finally, statins impair the function of Akt due to
  the impaired insulin signaling pathway and due to the impaired function of mTORC2.
  As a result, statins induce increased protein degradation and impaired protein synthesis,
  promoting skeletal muscle atrophy [].
