caption: 'IL-32 regulates the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling pathway. (A) The expression
  levels of the proteins related to the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling were determined using
  western blotting. (B) The efficacy of NOD2 overexpressing plasmids was verified
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and (C) western blot assays. (D) The effects
  of NOD2 overexpression on the expression levels of the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling
  pathway-proteins were assessed using western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control or
  Ov-NC, ###P<0.001 vs. H/R and &&&P<0.001 vs. H/R + siRNA-IL-32 + Ov-NC. IL, interleukin;
  NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; NOX, NADPH oxidase; NC, negative
  control; H/R, hypoxia and reoxygenation; siRNA, small interfering RNA.'

  inflammation and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling
  pathway.
