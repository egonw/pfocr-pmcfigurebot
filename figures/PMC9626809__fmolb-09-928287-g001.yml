caption: 'Enzymatic biosynthesis and oxidative pathway of hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
  The biosynthesis of H2S was mediated by CBS, CSE, and 3-MST. The major substrates
  are homocysteine and L-cysteine. Persulfide and polysulfides reduced in mitochondria
  also generate H2S. H2S can be oxidized by SQR, SD, and ST, which are mitochondrial
  inner membrane-anchored enzymes, to form sulfate and deprived from the organism.
  CBS: cystathionine β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; CAT, cysteine aminotransferase;
  CoQ, coenzyme Q; CARS, cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases; 3-MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate; MST,
  3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; SQR, sulfide quinone
  reductase; SD, sulfur dioxygenase; ST, sulfur transferase.'
