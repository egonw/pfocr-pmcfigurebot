caption: Individual lncRNAs have multiple miRNA targets and involve different signaling
  pathways. In brain ischemic injury, for example, lncRNA TUG1 can bind miR-9, upregulate
  FOXO3 expression and increase neuronal apoptosis in mice with middle cerebral artery
  occlusion (); lncRNA TUG1 binds miR-29b-1-5p, activates the NF-κB/IL-β signaling
  pathway, and induces inflammatory damage in rats with spinal cord I/R injury ();
  lncRNA TUG1 can directly interact with miR-145 and function as a competing endogenous
  RNA of miR-145, regulate AQP4 expression and induce cell damage in cerebral I/R
  injury (); lncRNA TUG1 binds miR-410, regulates FOXO3 expression and induces apoptosis
  and inflammation in cerebral I/R injury (); lncRNA TUG1 binds miR-410-3p and miR-493-3p,
  activates the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and induces inflammation and
  oxidative damage in cerebral I/R injury (). In heart ischemic injury, lncRNA TUG1
  binds miR-9, regulates KLF5 expression and induces apoptosis in myocardial I/R injury
  (); lncRNA TUG1 activates HDAC3 by sponging miR-132-3p, stimulates intracellular
  ROS accumulation and aggravates myocardial ischemic injury (); lncRNA TUG1 binds
  miR-142-3p, regulates expression of HMGB1 and Rac1, and induces the apoptosis and
  autophagy of ischemic/hypoxia cardiomyocytes (); lncRNA TUG1 binds miR-340, regulates
  HDAC4 expression, mediates β-catenin/GLUT1 and induces apoptosis in myocardial I/R
  injury (). In kidney ischemic injury, lncRNA TUG1 interacts with miR-449b-5p, and
  then regulates expression of HMGB1 and MMP2, inducing apoptosis and inflammation
  in I/R injury (). However, lncRNA TUG1 binds miR-494-3p, regulates E-cadherin expression
  and inhibits apoptosis, alleviating I/R induced acute kidney injury (). lncRNA,
  long non-coding RNA; TUG1, taurine up-regulated gene 1; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion;
  KLF5, Kruppel like factor 5; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; HDAC3, histone deacetylase
  3.
