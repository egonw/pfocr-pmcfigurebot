caption: Knockdown of IMPA2 significantly reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis
  in the epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines. (A and B) Multiparametric high-content
  screening was used to determine proliferation in the (A) ES-2 and (B) SKOV3 cells
  transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2 between days 1 and 5 after seeding an equal
  amount of the cells. Proliferation in the (C) ES-2 and (D) SKOV3 cells transfected
  with shCtrl and shIMPA2 was analyzed using an MTT assay. The (E) ES-2 cells and
  (F) SKOV3 cells transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2 were analyzed using colony formation
  assays. The (G) ES-2 and the (H) SKOV3 cells transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2
  were analyzed using Annexin V/PI staining for apoptosis detection. **P<0.01 and
  ***P<0.001 vs. shCtrl. IMPA2, inositol monophosphatase 2; sh, short hairpin; Ctrl,
  control.
