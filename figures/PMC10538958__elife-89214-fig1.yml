caption: (a) Hierarchical clustering of proteins significantly differentially expressed
  in each IF group and AL group (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test). The color scale
  denotes z-score normalized protein abundances. Red denotes higher protein abundance,
  and blue lower protein abundance. Gene ontology-based biological processes and pathways
  significantly enriched in representative protein clusters across the different groups.
  Selected enzymes specifically modulated within each cluster are highlighted. (b)
  IF-modulated kinases involved in metabolic pathways and signaling pathways. (c)
  Enrichment analysis of modulated processes and pathways in the different IF groups
  in comparison to the AL group (1-D annotation enrichment using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  test). Each dot represents a functional process or pathway. A positive enrichment
  score denotes higher protein abundance, and a negative enrichment score denotes
  lower protein abundance. n=4–5 mice in each experimental group.

  remodeling of the heart during intermittent fasting.
