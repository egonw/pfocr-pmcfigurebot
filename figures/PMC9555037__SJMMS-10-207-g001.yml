caption: 'The effects of DON (5 μm), RGN (0-5 μm), or a combination thereof on the
  proliferation of HepG2 cells. (a) DON on HepG2 viability (0-10 μm for 6, 12, or
  24 h, respectively). (b) Cell viability effect of RGN on HepG2 (0-5 μm for 24 h).
  (c) RGN protects against the cytotoxic effect of DON. (d) SDS-PAGE was done after
  different concentrations of DON (5 μm) or RGN (0-1) were added to cells for 24 hours.
  Expressions of TNFα and COX-2 were analyzed. (e) DCFH2-DA was used to measure intracellular
  ROS generation. Data are mean ± SD of values (n = 3), *P < 0.05 represents significant
  difference compared to DON alone. #P < 0.05 for RGN compared with the DON treatment
  groups'
