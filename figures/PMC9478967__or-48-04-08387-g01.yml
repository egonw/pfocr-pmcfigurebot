  CDCA5 co-expressed genes in BC using LinkedOmics. (A) The top 50 positively and
  (B) 50 negatively correlated genes are displayed. (C) GO enrichment analysis (top
  10 terms of each subtype: biological pathway, cellular component and molecular function)
  of genes co-expressed with CDCA5. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis (top 30 terms) of
  genes co-expressed with CDCA5. Correlation analysis between CDCA5 and (E) c-MYC,
