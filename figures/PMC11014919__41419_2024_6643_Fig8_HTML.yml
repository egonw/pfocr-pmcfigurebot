figure_title: ANXA9 enhances VEGF expression and promotes breast cancer metastasis
caption: A Tumors from mice xenografts stained with IHC staining showed a decrease
  in VEGF expression in sh-ANXA9 and sh-S100A4 groups; B Analysis of bioinformatics
  data from TCGA revealed that ANXA9 expression in MBC is positively correlated with
  VEGF expression (R = 0.32, p = 9.8e-06); C Down-regulated ANXA9 in BC cells resulted
  in decreasing secretion of VEGF in extracellular medium; D Up-regulated ANXA9 in
  BC cells resulted in increasing secretion of VEGF in extracellular medium; E The
  rescue experiments revealed the inhibitors of STAT3 (Stattic and Cardamonin) could
  recruit the cellular motility function which affected by ANXA9 via migration and
  invasion assays; F The sketch map of the regulation and mechanism of ANXA9 mediated
  BC metastasis. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. All of the experiments were
  replicated for three times.
