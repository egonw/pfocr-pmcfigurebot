caption: CBX7 overexpression suppressed the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in LUAD and
  LUSC cells. (a) Relative mRNA expression of CBX7, ERK1/2, and p38 in A549 and SK-MES-1
  cells was detected by qRT-PCR. (b) Relative protein levels of CBX7, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2,
  p38, and p-p38 in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells were detected by Western blotting. A549
  and SK-MES-1 cells were transfected with lenti-NC or lenti-CBX7. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs.
  lenti-NC.
