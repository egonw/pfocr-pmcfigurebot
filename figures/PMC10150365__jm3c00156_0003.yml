caption: Matched molecular pair analysis on the effect of halogen substitution on
  multidrug resistance. The efflux ratio is calculated from the ratio of geometric
  mean GI50 values in the CH1WT and CH1doxR cell lines; each GI50 is calculated from
  at least n = 3 biological repeats. Each colored line represents an MMP varying only
  at the central ring substituent. The gray bars represent the arithmetic mean Â± SEM
  of the grouped central ring substituents. The gray dotted line is the efflux ratio
  = 1. See Table S3 for details.
