figure_title: Heterogeneity of gene expression and phylogenetic signal in CRC
caption: 'a, Heatmaps showing clustering of genes by expression level across tumours
  (left) and expression variation within tumours (right). Hierarchical clustering
  showed four distinct groups, groups 1–4. Units are scaled by column in each heatmap.
  b,c, Summary box plots per gene group (group 1, 891 genes; group 2, 2,444 genes;
  group 3, 5,033 genes; group 4, 3,033 genes). Mean expression level (b) and intratumour
  heterogeneity of expression (c) per group, as measured by s.d. d, Meta-KEGG pathway
  analysis showing which pathway categories are most over-represented in each group
  (after removal of ‘infectious disease: bacterial’ and ‘neurodegenerative disease’—most
  significant in group 1). e,f, Phylogenetic trees and heatmaps of genes with evidence
  of phylogenetic signal (at P < 0.05) for tumours C551 (e) and C554 (f). g, Heatmap
  of genes with recurrent phylogenetic signal across tumours (those which were found
  to have evidence of phylogenetic signal in at least three tumours). h, Results of
  chi-squared test showing whether gene groups were enriched for phylogenetic genes
  (those with evidence of phylogenetic signal in at least one tumour—“Phylo”) compared
  to all other genes (“Non-phylo”). i, Enrichment of KEGG PPAR signalling pathway
  for recurrently phylogenetic genes. j, Example phylogenetic tree and pathway enrichment
  heatmap for tumour C559. Pathways are ordered by decreasing significance of phylogenetic
  signal. k, Heatmap showing recurrence of phylogenetic signal of pathways across
  tumours. Pathways are ordered by decreasing recurrence. Refer to pathway key in
  Extended Data Fig.  for pathway names. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Mean
  norm., mean gene expression in normal samples; Mean mean exp., mean of mean gene expression
  per tumour; Mean var., mean standard deviation of gene expression; MedPval, median
  P-value from forest of 100 trees; MedLambda, median λ value from forest of 100 trees;
  NumRec, number of tumours in which gene has evidence of phylogenetic signal; Num
  Sig, number of tumours in which pathway has evidence of phylogenetic signal; d.f.,
  degrees of freedom.'
