caption: '5D3PC ameliorates C57BL/6 mice model of hydroquinone-induced vitiligo. (A)
  Effect of 5D3PC on C57BL/6 mouse model; presentation of phenotype of mice from control,
  hydroquinone, and 5D3PC groups, respectively. Photograph is taken after 0 days of
  experiments, 20 days after hydroquinone induce model, and after 30 days of treatment.
  (B) The degree of depigmentation was scored blindly after 30 days. (C). Melanin
  content in skin tissue treated with different concentrations (0.0425, 0.425, and
  4.25 mg/kg) 5D3PC. (D).H&E staining of C57BL/6 mice skin oral administration with
  vehicle, 8-MOP(4.25 mg/kg) or 5D3PC (0.0425 mg/kg, 0.425 mg/kg, 4.25 mg/kg). (E)
  the numbers of melanin-containing hair follicles in mouse dorsal skin by Lillie-stained.
  Quantification of melanin containing-hair follicles. All results are expressed as
  mean ± SD; statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test. ###p < 0.001 compare with control group. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with Model group.'
