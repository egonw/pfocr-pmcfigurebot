caption: Effects of TriL on Ras/MEK/ERK pathway and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)
  protein levels. A series of experiments were performed to measure the effects of
  TriL on levels of the candidate signaling proteins. (A) Ras, MEK, p-MEK, ERK, p-ERK,
  and MMP-2 in PDGF-BB-stimulated A7r5 cells. (B) TriL at a concentration of 5, 10,
  20 µM significantly reduced protein levels of Ras (*** p < 0.001); MEK (*** p <
  0.001); p-MEK (*** p < 0.001) and p-ERK (*** p < 0.001). MMP-2 protein levels were
  also reduced by TriL (5, 10, 20 µM) * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, respectively
  (n = 3~5).
