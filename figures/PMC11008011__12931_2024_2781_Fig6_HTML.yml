caption: ZNF451 depletion increases PDGFB expression. A Bar graph showing differential
  gene expression between Ctrl-shRNA and ZNF451-shRNA MRC5 cells. B Reactome pathway
  analysis of differentially expressed genes in ZNF451-shRNA versus Ctrl-shRNA MRC5
  cells. C Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of pathways associated with fibroblast
  activation that were enriched in ZNF451-shRNA versus Ctrl-shRNA MRC5 cells. D Volcano
  plots show differential gene expression between Ctrl-shRNA and ZNF451-shRNA MRC5
  cells. E RT‒PCR of PDGFB mRNA in Ctrl-shRNA and ZNF451-shRNA MRC5 cells. F RT‒PCR
  of Pdgfb mRNA in primary lung fibroblasts isolated from WT mice or Znf451-/- mice.
  G RT‒PCR of Pdgfb mRNA in lung tissues from WT mice or Znf451-/- mice. H GSEA showing
  that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is activated in ZNF451-shRNA vs. Ctrl-shRNA
  MRC-5 cells. I Correlation analysis between the mRNA expression of Znf451 and Pdgfb
  in PF lungs (n = 9)
