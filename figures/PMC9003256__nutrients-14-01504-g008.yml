caption: 'Schematic illustration of the protective role of vitamin K2 in 6-OHDA-induced
  cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The 6-OHDA triggered ROS, causing oxidative stress
  in SH-SY5Y cells, which leads to mitochondrial depolarization (mitochondrial membrane
  potential reduction) and induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, resulting
  in neuronal cell death. However, post-treatment with vitamin K2 maintains the balance
  of mitochondrial fission/fusion through the expression of regulatory proteins MFN1/2
  and DRP1; promotes mitophagy by recruiting autophagy molecules p62 and LC3 through
  the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway; and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through
  the expression of regulatory proteins PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM. Thus, the normal operation
  of the mitochondrial quality-control loop (mitochondrial fusion, fission, autophagy,
  and biogenesis) is maintained, the intracellular oxidative stress is relieved, the
  cell membrane potential is restored, and the mitochondrial dysfunction is relieved.
  Moreover, by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2 protein and downregulating the
  expression of Bax protein to play the role of the main switch of apoptosis, the
  cell damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction is reduced. Note: ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; 6-OHDA, 6-Hydroxydopamine; Ψm, mitochondrial membrane potential.'
