caption: 'Knocking down SOX8 and treatment with RO04929097 inhibit Notch signaling
  and its downstream. (a–c) Notch signaling activity in Enza-R cells after knocking
  down SOX8 was detected by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Cell nuclei
  were stained with DAPI (magnification, ×200). In order for the figure to be more
  concise, panels for DAPI staining alone are not shown. (d–f) Downstream genes of
  Notch signaling were detected in DU145 and Enza-R cells after knocking down SOX8
  and/or treating with RO04929097 using Western blot and immunofluorescence. ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001; GAPDH served as a loading control. Enza-R: enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP
  cells.'
