caption: Simplified GnRH signaling pathway for Homo sapiens. The Figure was modified
  starting from the whole pathway provided by KEGG (hsa04912). The whole pathway is
  provided in Supplementary Material. GnRH = Gonadotropin releasing hormone. GnRHR
  = Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor. Gs and Gq/11 = G-proteins. PLC = Phospholipase
  C. DAG = Diacyl-glycerol. PKC = Protein Kinase C. MEKK, MKK3/6, p38MAPK, MAPK =
  different mitogen activates protein kinases. HB-EGF = Heparin binding epidermal
  growth factor. EGFR = Epidermal growth factor receptor. MEK. Mitogen-activated ERK
  kinase. ERK1/2 = extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Elk1 = Transcription
  factor ELK. Egr-1 = Early growth response protein 1. LH = Luteinizing hormone. FSH
  = Follicle-stimulating hormone. GSU = Glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit.
