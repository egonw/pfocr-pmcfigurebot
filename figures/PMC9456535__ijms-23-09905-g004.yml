caption: 'Genome-wide identification of the FtcR regulons: (A) A representative image
  of the FtcR ChIP-Seq read alignments to the B. melitensis 16M genome, visualized
  as ChIP-Seq peaks using the Integrated Genome Viewer software. Peak height correlates
  with the number of reads from the input (blue) or the IP (green) at the corresponding
  positions of the B. melitensis 16M genome. (B) Density plot of FtcR ChIP-Seq reads
  at 4 kb genomic regions centered at peak summits. (C) Venn diagram of intersecting
  genes observed to be differentially expressed in RNA-Seq and genes identified as
  directly bound by FtcR in ChIP-Seq analyses. A total of 54 genes present at the
  intersection of these three datasets were defined as the regulons of FtcR. (D) A
  heatmap illustrating the 54 differentially expressed regulons of FtcR between the
  biofilms of WT and âˆ†ftcR.'
