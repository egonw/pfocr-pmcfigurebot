caption: Expression patterns of apoptotic genes related to the three signaling pathways
  during the gonadal development of Monopterus albus. (A), Expression patterns of
  bax and apaf-1 in the mitochondrial pathway. (B), Expression patterns of fadd and
  tnfr1 in the dead receptor pathway. (C), Expression patterns of calpain in the ER
  pathway. OV, ovary; IE, early intersexual stage gonad; IM, middle intersexual stage
  gonad; IL, late intersexual stage gonad; TE, testis. The results are presented as
  the means Â± SEMs. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences between two groups
  (p < 0.05).
