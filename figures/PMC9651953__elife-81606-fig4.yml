figure_title: Ninein-like (NINL) knockout (KO) cells have reduced pSTAT1 nuclear localization
caption: (A) Confocal micrographs displayed as maximum intensity projections of wild-type
  (WT), NINL KO, and NIN KO A549 cells. Where indicated, cells were treated for 1
  hr with 1000U interferon alpha (IFNα). pSTAT1 was immunostained with anti-phosphorylated
  STAT1 (Y701) and nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Dashed white lines denote cell
  boundaries. Representative micrographs from three biological replicates are shown.
  15 μm scale bars are also shown. (B) Quantification of the mean nuclear to mean
  cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity of pSTAT1 from three biological replicates. Light
  gray datapoints correspond to the mean ratio of all cells in a field of view. Dark
  gray, large, outlined circles correspond to the mean for each of the three biological
  replicates. For each condition, n = 30. The mean across all replicates is denoted
  by the bold line. Data were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s post-hoc test
  for multiple comparisons. ****p<0.0001, ns, not significant. (C) Schematic depicting
  where in the IFN signaling pathway NINL acts. Figure 4—source data 1.Individual
