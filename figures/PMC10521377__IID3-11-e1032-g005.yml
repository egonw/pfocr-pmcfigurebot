caption: Effects of different concentrations of cathelicidin (LL‐37) on the biological
  behavior and toll‐like receptors 4 (TLR4)‐NF‐κB signaling pathway of human coronary
  artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). (A) Flow cytometry scatter plot; (B) transmission
  electron microscopy observation (25,000×, Scale bar, 500 nm); (C) cell apoptosis;
  (D) cell absorbance value at 450 nm; (E) the mRNA levels of LL‐37 and NLRP3 in cells;
  (F, G) the protein expression of NF‐κB p65 and TLR4 in cells was detected by Western
  blot analysis, those in western blot assays were expressed after being normalized
  to β‐actin. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared with the control group,
  *p < .05 **p < .01.
