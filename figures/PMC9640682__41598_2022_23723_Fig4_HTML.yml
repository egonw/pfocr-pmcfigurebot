caption: Predicted targets of miR-27a in the EMT pathway. miR-27a could interact with
  and target multiple gene transcripts contributing to the EMT signaling pathway which
  eventually results in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts; these
  cells are responsible for the development of fibrosis which is a key feature of
  SSc.
