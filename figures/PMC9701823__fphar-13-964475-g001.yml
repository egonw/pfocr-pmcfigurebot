caption: 'OEA decreased the levels of CK-MB, LDH, and MDA, while increased the level
  of SOD. (A–C) A myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model for diabetic rats was established,
  and the changes in body weight, blood glucose level, and HbA1c level in each group
  (n = 12) were measured; (D–G) Biochemical detection of changes in the levels of
  CK-MB and LDH in serum, and levels of SOD and MDA in myocardium of rats after OEA
  administration (n = 12). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, φφP <0.01, φφφP <0.001
  vs. NOR + S group; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs. DM + S group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01
  vs. DM + I/R group.'
