caption: 'ER apoptotic pathway in neuronal apoptosis after subarachnoid hemorrhage.ER
  stress induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage activates three transmembrane proteins
  on the ER, and induces apoptosis through PEAK/EIF-2Î±/ATF4/CHOP, IER1 and ATF6/CHOP,
  respectively. Meanwhile, Ca2+ imbalance leads to a large amount of Ca2+ entering
  cytoplasm and mitochondria, which affects the activity of bcl-2 family proteins
  in mitochondria and leads to cell apoptosis. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; UPR: unfolded
  protein response.'

  and potential therapeutic targets in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
