caption: Effect of a crude extract of EL001672 and 1′-O-methyl-averantin on the NOTCH
  signaling pathway. (A,B) Quantitative analysis of Notch-1 and Hes-1 (hairy and enhancer
  of split-1) mRNA expression by CSC221 cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of crude extract or 1′-O-methyl-averantin and incubated 48 h. (C,D) CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1)-luc
  and Hes-1 reporter assays in HEK293T cells treated with 2.5, 5, or 10 μg/mL crude
  extract, 1′-O-methyl-averantin, 5 μg/mL GANT61 (a Gli inhibitor), and Vismodegib-GDC-0449
  (a SMO inhibitor) and incubated 48 h. 10, 5 and 2.5 µg/ml 1′-O-methyl averantin
  represent a concentration of 25.90, 12.95 and 6.47 µM, respectively. Data represent
  the mean ± standard error of the mean. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; difference
  compared with each groups.
