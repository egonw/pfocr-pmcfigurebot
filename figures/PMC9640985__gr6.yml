caption: miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p directly target DKK4 in CRC cells.A, qRT‒PCR and
  Western blot of DKK4 expression in SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with miR-106a,
  miR-450b-5p, or miR-299-3p mimics and their controls. N.S., not significant. ∗∗p <
  0.01. B, a schematic representation of the predicted duplex sequences between the
  DKK4 3′-UTR and miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p. Mutations were designed at the predicted
  miR-450b-5p- and miR-299-3p-binding sites. C, the DKK4 WT and mutant reporter plasmids
  were cotransfected with miR-450b-5p (above), miR-299-3p (below) mimic, and the controls.
  Luciferase activity values were measured and analyzed. N.S., not significant. ∗∗p <
  0.01. D, transwell assay showing the migration and invasion abilities of SW480 cells
  transfected with miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p mimics or the corresponding negative
  control. The scale bars represent 200 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01. E, transwell assay showing
  the migration and invasion abilities of HCT8 cells transfected with miR-450b-5p
  and miR-299-3p inhibitors or the corresponding negative control. The scale bars
  represent 200 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01. F, transwell assay showing the migration and invasion
  abilities of HCT8 cells transfected with LV-DKK4 in combination with or without
  miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p mimics. The scale bars represent 200 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01.
