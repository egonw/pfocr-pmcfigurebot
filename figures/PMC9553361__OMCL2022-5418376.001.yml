caption: 'Metabolic pathway of copper in human body. Transport route of copper in
  human body: oral intake, in the gastrointestinal tract absorption into the blood,
  the blood vessels in the copper blue protein combined with albumin and plasma protein
  transport via portal vein circulation to the liver [, ]. After the liver processing,
  the redistribution to the tissues and organs, such as the skeletal muscle, brain,
  and heart, widely participates in various life activities [, ]. Finally, through
  metabolism, bile enters the intestine and is excreted in the stool or through the
  kidney and is excreted in the urine [, ]. ATP7A: adenosine triphosphatase 1; CTR1:
  copper transporter 1; MT: metallothionein (storage of cytosol exceeding copper);
  SOD1: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; GSH: glutathione; CP: ceruloplasmin.'
