caption: The effect of CPP on related genes after treatment with an inhibitor of HIF-1α.
  (a–n) HDFs were pretreated with LW6, an inhibitor of HIF-1α, for 12 h, and then
  treated with CPP (10 μM) for 6 days (D6), and qPCR was conducted to detect the expression
  of EC genes (CD31, CD133, CDH5, vWF, eNOS and ANGPT1), fibroblastic genes (Vimentin,
  Collagen 1, FAP, ACTA2 and FSP1), and pro-angiogenic factors (FGF-2, VEGF, PDGF-BB).
  Data are presented as means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n = 3.
