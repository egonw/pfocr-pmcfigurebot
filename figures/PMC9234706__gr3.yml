caption: Proteomic analysis identifies changes to sugar metabolism upon hpm1 knockout.A,
  label-swap replicates prepared by 2nSILAC (arginine +10, lysine +8) were used to
  compare the steady-state proteome of log-phase WT and Δhpm1. The tryptic digests
  were fractionated by SCX and then subjected to high-resolution HCD MS/MS analysis
  on a Fusion Lumos. B, results of the differential proteome abundance analysis. Labeled
  proteins have an adjusted p value ≤0.05 and log2 fold change ≥1 or ≤−1. C, statistically
  significant child terms resulting from a Panther Biological Process GO term overrepresentation
  analysis using 24 proteins as input (adjusted p≤ 0.1), with all quantified proteins
  used as background. Changing GO terms are annotated, and the asterisk ∗ represents
  enrichment fold changes >100. D, proteins involved in the trehalose biosynthetic
  pathway, with protein log2 changes overlaid by color. 2nSILAC, isotopic labeling
  of lysine and arginine in prototrophic yeast; GO, Gene Ontology; HCD, higher-energy
  collision dissociation; SCX, strong cation exchange.
