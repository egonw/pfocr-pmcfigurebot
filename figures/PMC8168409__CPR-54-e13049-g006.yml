caption: Retinoic acid regulates 2C‐like state by metabolic process. A, RA‐2i/L‐ESCs
  show global downregulation of glycolysis gluconeogenesis‐related genes by gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA). Normalized enrichment score (NES) and nominal P values
  are shown. B, Heat map showing expression levels of metabolic process and signalling
  pathway genes in 2i/L‐ESCs and RA‐2i/L‐ESCs. C, NELFA‐GFP reporter 2i/L‐ESCs and
  RA‐2i/L‐ESCs were treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX).
  Scale bars, 100 μm. D, RA‐2i/L‐ESCs show global downregulation of ribosome‐related
  genes by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Normalized enrichment score (NES)
  and nominal P values are shown. E, RA‐2i/L‐ESCs show global upregulation of WNT
  signalling pathway‐related genes by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Normalized
  enrichment score (NES) and nominal P values are shown. F, RA‐2i/L‐ESCs show global
  upregulation of Hippo signalling pathway‐related genes by gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA). Normalized enrichment score (NES) and nominal P values are shown. G, RA‐2i/L‐ESCs
  were removed CHIR99021 and cultured with WNT signalling inhibitor IWR1 or XAV939
  containing medium. Scale bars, 100 μm
