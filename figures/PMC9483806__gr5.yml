caption: Associations between two immune subtypes and clinically actionable genes
  and drug susceptibility. (A) Differentially expressed clinical actionable genes
  (CAGs) targeted by FDA-approved drugs. The barplot shows CAGs that vary significantly
  between immune subtype groups. (B) Drugs sensitive to IRS and the signaling pathways
  they target. The upper barplot represents the correlation between IRS and drug sensitivity.
  The right histogram represents the number of drugs targeting each pathway. (C) Sensitivity
  of two immune subtypes to drugs (grouping 835 cancer cell lines form CTRP database
  based on IRS).
