caption: a, Synergistic antibiotic combinations may operate in a mechanism cooperation
  mode and consist of antibiotics targeting nearby biosynthetic steps within an essential
  pathway. b, We view the numerous metabolic pathways in a cell as a densely interconnected
  network. Disrupting a hub (blue‐filled circle) will weaken itself and many other
  pathways (open circles, dotted edges), resulting in an overall debilitated network
  that is much more sensitive toward other disruptions. In this study, we used the
  lasso peptide MccJ25, an antibiotic known to bind and inhibit the RNAP complex,
  to disrupt transcription (the hub) and investigate whether it potentiates the activity
  of other antibiotics.
