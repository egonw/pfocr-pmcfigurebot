caption: '5D3PC induces melanogenesis by activating the cAMP/PKA signal pathway. (A)
  The levels of p-CREB in B16 cells were determined by WB analysis. (B) the levels
  of p-CREB after being treated with 5D3PC in C57BL/6 mouse model. p-CREB proteins
  were analyzed relative to β-actin expression. (C) B16-intracellular cAMP levels
  and (D) C57BL/6 mouse skin-cAMP levels were analyzed using a cAMP assay ELISA kit.
  (E) 5D3PC-induced melanin synthesis and p-CREB expression were blocked by PKA inhibitors
  in B16 cells. All results are expressed as mean ± SD; statistical analysis was performed
  with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. #p < 0.005, *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with NC (negative control) group.'
