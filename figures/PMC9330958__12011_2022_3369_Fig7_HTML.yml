caption: Signaling pathway participated in the inhibition of H1N1 by ebselen. (A)
  Regulation of apoptotic proteins. (B) Scheme of apoptosis signaling pathways. The
  titer of H1N1 was 100 TCID50/0.1 mL. MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 for 2 h
  and then treated with 8 mM ebselen for 48 h. After that, MDCK cells were lysed with
  RIPA lysate. Each experiment was repeated at least three times (n = 3)
