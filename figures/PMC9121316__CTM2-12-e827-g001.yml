caption: 'Single‐cell omics in ageing. Ageing is caused by interconnected molecular
  changes in a wide variety of cells in multiple organs. Single‐cell technology provides
  a map of human ageing which integrates multiple networks at different biological
  levels and suggests potential avenues for therapeutic intervention (A). Single‐cell
  technology can help identify multiple changes in ageing, including the metabolism
  (B), immune system (C) and signalling pathway changes (D). NK cells: natural killer
  cells; cDC1: conventional type 1 dendritic cell; ICAM1: intercellular adhesion molecule
  1; ILC1s: group 1 innate lymphoid cells; ILC2s: group 2 innate lymphoid cells; PGC1α:
  peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ coactivator‐1α; JNK: c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; MEKK: mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase kinase; ERK: extracellular
  regulated protein kinase; FOXO: Forkhead box O; IGF‐1R: type 1 insulin‐like growth
  factor receptor; AMPK: AMP‐activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase'

  of ageing and rejuvenation from clinical observation to single‐cell solution.'
