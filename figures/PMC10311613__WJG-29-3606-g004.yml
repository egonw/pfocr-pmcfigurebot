caption: 'BMI-1 conditioned medium induces activation of the transforming growth factor
  beta/SMAD pathway in colorectal cancer cells. A: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  analysis showed no difference in the expression of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in colorectal
  cancer (CRC) cells cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from negative control NC)
  (NC CM) or CM from BMI-1 overexpressed LX2 (BMI-1 CM); B: Western blot assays of
  SMAD2, SMAD3, phosphorylated (p)-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 expression levels in CRC cells
  cultured in NC CM or BMI-1 CM; C and D: Western blot analysis of the expression
  of SMAD pathway members and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins (Snail
  and vimentin) in CRC cells cultured in NC CM or BMI-1 CM with/without 0.5 Î¼M SB-505124
  treatment, the relative expression levels of the proteins were calculated and are
  shown in D. cP < 0.001.'
