caption: BTD induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. (A) GSEA analysis
  of HCT116 cells treated with 5 μM BTD for 24 h (B,C) Cells were treated with BTD
  (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 μM) for 24 h and stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA solution
  to detect ROS levels (B), or stained with Rh123 to detect changes in ΔΨm (C), then
  measured using flow cytometry. (D,E) ROS and ΔΨm levels. Bars represent mean ± standard
  deviation. (F) HCT116 cells were treated with 5 μM BTD for 24 h, then the expression
  of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax,
  Bim, and Bad, the caspase family proteins cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 were detected
  using Western blotting. (G) HCT116 cells were treated with 5 μM BTD for 24 h, and
  the expression of Cyto C and Bax in the mitochondria and cytoplasm were detected
  using Western blotting.
