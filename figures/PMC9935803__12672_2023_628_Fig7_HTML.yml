caption: Glutamine promotes CA19-9 biosynthesis in vivo. A-D The expression of CA19-9
  in SW1990 (A) and BxPC-3 (C) subcutaneous tumor models was examined by immunofluorescence
  confocal microscopy. Mice were treated with or without Don. Quantification is shown
  to the right (B, D). Data are randomly chosen in seven different fields. E, F The
  serum concentration of CA19-9 for SW1990 subcutaneous and footpad animal models
  by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Animals were treated with or without 15 μg/g
  Don. n = 6 mice per group for subcutaneous models and n = 5 mice per group for footpad
  models. G, H The serum concentration of CA19-9 for BxPC-3 subcutaneous and footpad
  animal models by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Animals were treated with
  or without 15 μg/g Don. n = 8 mice per group. I Schematic depicting the synthesis
  of CA19-9 from glutamine. UDP-GlcNAc is an intermediate product for CA19-9 biosynthesis.
  The double arrow represents multiple reactions. UDP-GlcNAc UDP-N-acetylglucosamine,
  Gln glutamine, Don Diazooxonorleucine, Aza Azaserine. Data represent mean ± s.e.m.
