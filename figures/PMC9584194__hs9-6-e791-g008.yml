caption: Carfilzomib nephrotoxicity is presented with increased serum creatinine,
  LDH concentrations, and proteinuria. SGK-1 is upregulated in renal biopsies of patients
  with Carfilzomib-related nephrotoxicity. Graphs of serum (A) serum LDH (mg/mL),
  (B) creatinine (mg/mL) and (C) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min/1.73m2)
  using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula and
  (D) urine protein (g/24 h) prior (baseline, start of therapy) and post-Carfilzomib–induced
  nephrotoxicity (at the timepoint of clinical presentation of nephrotoxicity) (n
  = 7 per group). (E) Representative immunohistological stainings of SGK-1(upper panel)
  and MR (lower panel) in (a) control renal biopsies and (b–d) Renal biopsies from
  patients with Carfilzomib-induced nephrotoxicity [(b) low histology score (>1);
  (c) medium histology score (>2); (d) high histology score (>3); 5×, 10×, and 20×,
  scale bar represents 200 μm]. (F and G) Graphs of Relative Histology score of SGK-1
  and MR expression in the control and Carfilzomib nephrotoxicity renal biopsies (n
  = 3 and n = 7, respectively). (H–J) Correlation graphs of SGK-1 expression and serum
  creatine, urine protein, and eGFR, respectively. Mann-Whitney test, paired and unpaired,
  2-tailed T-Test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
