caption: Knockout of SALL4 by CRISPR/Cas9 inhibits the pro-angiogenic effect of gastric
  cancer cellsin vitro. A Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were used for
  the confirmation of the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiment. B The expression levels
  of SALL4-B, VEGF-A, B, and C mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR in gastric cancer cells
  with SALL4 knockout by CRISPR/Cas9. C The expression levels of SALL4-B, VEGF-A,
  B, and C proteins were determined by western blot in gastric cancer cells with SALL4
  knockout by CRISPR/Cas9. GAPDH was used as a loading control. D The expression level
  of VEGF-A, B, and C in the CM from control and SALL4 knockout cells were detected
  by ELISA assay. HUVECs were treated with a serum-free medium or CMs from SALL4 knockout
  gastric cancer cells. E After treatment for 48 h, CCK-8 assays were performed to
  evaluate cell proliferation. F Transwell migration assay was performed to determine
  the migration of HUVECs with CM treatment. G Tube formation in HUVECs treated with
  indicated CMs. The results are presented as the means ± standard error of mean (SEM).
