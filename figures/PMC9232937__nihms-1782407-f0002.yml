figure_title: Nucleus accumbens astrocytes are highly rhythmic at the transcriptome
  level
caption: Among the 12,739 genes identified in NAc astrocytes, approximately 43.3%
  of genes exhibited rhythmic expression across the 6 ZTs sampled (ZT2,6,10,14,18,22;
  n=4–5 per ZT, JTK_Cycle), or 5,527 genes at the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value cutoff
  of p<0.05. Even using the most stringent statistical cutoff (Benjamini-Hochberg
  q-value cutoff of q<0.0001), approximately ~9% of transcripts still display diurnal
  rhythmicity, or 1,141 genes. (B) Phase analysis through radar plotting of top rhythmic
  transcripts (p<0.05) and heatmap visualization of the top 200 rhythmic genes reveal
  a majority of rhythmic transcripts peak between ZT14 and ZT18, coinciding with the
  dark phase / active phase. The radar plot perimeter axis represents ZT, while the
  inner axis is the number of genes with peak expression at a given ZT. Heatmap displays
  Z-transformed expression for each of the top 200 statistically rhythmic genes (as
  determined by JTK_Cycle), ranked in descending order along the Y-axis (rows) and
  each subject ordered by ZT along the x-axis (columns). The white bar indicates lights
  on (ZT2,6,10) and the black bars indicate lights off (ZT14,18,22). (C) IPA pathway
  analysis and Metascape Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process analysis revealed both
  circadian and metabolic-related processes enriched among the top rhythmic genes.
  Notable pathways/processes include circadian rhythm signaling and circadian regulation
  of gene expression, as well as NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, regulation
  of ATPase activity, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Red line in bar graphs
  indicates significance threshold of p<0.05 or −log10(p-value) > 1.3. (D) Core circadian
  genes are among the top rhythmic genes and show expression patterns that align with
  previously established functional relationships; i.e., Arntl (gene that encodes
  BMAL1) is anti-phasic with Per2 and Nr1d1). (E) Among the top enriched rhythmic
  GO biological processes, the circadian regulation of gene expression and glucocorticoid
  receptor signaling node clusters show a high degree of interconnectivity.
