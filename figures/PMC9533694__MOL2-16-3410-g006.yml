caption: 'FIR20 cells exhibit a treatment resistant, basal‐like gene expression profile
  underlined by increased levels of EGFR expression and MAPK pathway. Overlap of genes
  with increased expression in (A) the extended signature and (B) core signature with
  Post et al. [] genes which were increased in both tamoxifen and radiation resistant
  cells and Weichselbaum et al. [] genes which are associated with chemotherapy and/or
  radiation resistance. Heat map showing the expression of the extended signature
  genes that overlapped with (C) Post et al gene sets and (D) Weichselbaum et al.
  genes, respectively. Red indicates higher expression, blue indicates lower expression.
  #genes present in both Post et al. and Weichselbaum et al. signatures, *genes also
  present in the core radio‐adaptive signature. Clustering was performed using complete
  linkage (C) and average linkage (D) with Euclidean metric. (E) MSigDB C2: Curated
  pathways dysregulated in FIR20 cells based on enrichment analysis of the core signature
  genes showing dysregulation of ESR1 signaling, enrichment of tamoxifen and endocrine
  therapy resistance gene signatures, and basal‐like breast cancer genes. (F) Western
  blot analysis showing the expression profiles of ESR1 and EGFR in PAR, AMC and FIR20
  cell lines, n = 3 (G) images (top) and graph (bottom) showing cytotoxicity of 5 μm
  tamoxifen in PAR, AMC and FIR20. Images (72 h after tamoxifen treatment), graph
  (4–72 h) after tamoxifen treatment. Linear mixed effect model with Tukey''s honest
  significant difference test, **P ≤ 0.01 significance between both controls and FIR20,
  n = 3. Data is presented as mean ± (1.96 SE) of three biological replicates. Scale
  bars: 100 μm. Oncogenic signatures enriched in (H) the core signature and (I) FIR20
  vs. REST respectively. (J) Western blot analysis confirmed enrichment of MAPK pathway
  in FIR20 cells, n = 3. Bands from western blotting were semi‐quantitatively analyzed
  using imagej. Signals in AMC were set at 1.00 but no statistical analysis was performed.
