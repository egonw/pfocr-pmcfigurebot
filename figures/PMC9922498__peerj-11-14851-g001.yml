caption: Rat models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were established by ligating
  the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Total RNA was extracted
  from myocardial tissue of the infarct marginal zone. The differentially expressed
  miRNAs were detected by using the Agilent Rat miRNA gene chip. Gene Ontology (GO)
  and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were
  performed by DAVID. The expression of miR-199a-5p was verified by real-time fluorescence
  quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the target genes
  of miR-199a-5p were enriched in the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, dual-luciferase
  reporter assay indicated that miR-199a-5p could negatively regulate the expression
  of GSK-3β. The protein expression of GSK-3β was decreased in CFs transfected with
  miR-199a-5p mimics.
