caption: A subset of proliferative MDMs is associated with poor prognosis. (A) The
  bubble plot showed the gene expressions of the TAMs that originated from tissue‐invading
  monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDMs) or CNS‐resident microglia‐derived macrophages
  (microglia). (B) The UMAP view of macrophage. (C) Marker gene expression profiles
  of macrophage cell type. (D) KEGG pathway enriched in macrophage. Red colour represents
  upregulation and blue colour means downregulation. (E) Metabolism pathway enriched
  in macrophage. Red colour represents upregulation and blue colour means downregulation.
  (F) The relative proportion of M1 and M2 in GM and LC. (G) Expression of CCL2 in
  different types of macrophages showed with violin plot. (H) Gene bubble plot of
  immune checkpoint inhibition ligand genes. (I) Expression of genes was shown in
  the tSNE view. (J) Scoring all the macrophages by the senescence gene list. (K)
  Multiplex immunofluorescence staining of LC tissue.
