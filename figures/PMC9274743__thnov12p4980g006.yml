caption: DSP defines differential CTLA4 protein expression in PDAC adjacent immune
  cells. (A) Trend line plot to compare the eighteen target genes and three housekeeping
  genes expression between immunce cells adjacent (imm. C.-adj) and remote (imm. C.-rmt)
  to PDAC area. X-axis is grouped segments of ROIs and y-axis plots for nCount probe
  counts. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; (B) bar graft of the protein expression
  for the three checkpoint proteins PD-L1, PD-1 and CTLA4 in both immunce cells -adj
  and -rmt; ** p < 0.01. (C) The top significant function annotations predicted by
  IPA show impoverished T Cell Receptor Signalling pathway in immune cells adjacent
  to PDAC. The significance of canonical pathways was determined with default threshold
  of -log(p-value) = 1.3 (p-value = 0.05).
