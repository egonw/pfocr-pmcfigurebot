figure_title: Correlation between oncogenic genomic alterations and protein expression/activation
  in patients with progressive disease
caption: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using Ward’s method of members
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway shows increased activity and clustering of
  tumor epithelia collected from patients that developed disease progression (a).
  NGS-based analysis of the recurrent lesions at disease progression for three of
  the four patients with progressive disease identified an oncogenic mutation of PIK3CA
  in one patient and amplification of the CCND1 gene in the remaining two patients
  (b). Increased activation levels of AKT and mTOR detected in patients with progressive
  disease did not correlate with the underlying genotype (c–e). Similarly, the expression
  of Cyclin D1 did not directly correlate with CCND1 amplification (f).
