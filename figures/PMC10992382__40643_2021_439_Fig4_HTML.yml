caption: Schematic diagram of Rubisco carbon capture to produce d-lactate in E. coli.
  PRK, phosphoribulokinase, Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase,
  LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase, RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate,
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. “X” on the dotted arrows indicates that metabolic pathway
  was blocked. The skull and crossbones on the right side of RuBP indicates the toxicity
  induced by accumulation of RuBP. Orange quadrant of carboxyl carbon of the d-lactate
  indicates the exact position where the carbon of CO2 is captured, and one out of
  four d-lactate produced, theoretically, would have captured carbon in that position
article_title: Discovery of a readily heterologously expressed Rubisco from the deep
  sea with potential for CO2 capture.
