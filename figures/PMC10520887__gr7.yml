caption: The pSTING and CTT interact with KD and SDD of pIKKε.A, schematic of full-length
  pIKKε and its truncated mutants. B, structural view of the binding interface between
  pIKKε and pSTING CTT. C and D, GFP-pSTING or pSTING CTT was cotransfected with pIKKε
  truncation mutants into HEK293T for 48 h, and the cells were harvested and subjected
  for co-IP using subsequent Western blot analysis. E, each mCherry-pIKKε mutant was
  cotransfected with STING-GFP or STING CTT into 3D4/21 cells for 24 h, and then the
  cells were fixed, stained, and examined for cellular colocalization by confocal
  microscopy. co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; CTT, C-terminal tail; HEK293T, human embryonic
  kidney 293T cell line; KD, kinase domain; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; SDD, scaffold dimerization
  domain; STING, stimulator of interferon genes.
article_title: Porcine IKKε is involved in the STING-induced type I IFN antiviral
  response of the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway.
