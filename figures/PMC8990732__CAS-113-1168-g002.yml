caption: Hypoxic stress could promote enrichment of chaperone HSP90 and its client
  protein p‐IKKα/β in melanoma‐derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Small
  extracellular vesicles derived from melanoma cells, especially hypoxic melanoma
  cells, could activate the IKK/IκB/NF‐κB signaling pathway and promote CXCL1 expression
  in cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Elevated CXCL1 secretion from CAFs was
  able to promote tumor angiogenesis. CXCR, CXCL receptor

  melanoma‐associated fibroblasts via the NF‐κB/CXCL1 axis.
