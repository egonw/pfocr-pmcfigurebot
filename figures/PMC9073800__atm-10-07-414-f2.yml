caption: The two metabolic subtypes contained clusters of genes that were involved
  in the carbohydrate pathway and the lipid and energy metabolic pathway. (A) An unsupervised
  clustering heat map of the samples based on the characteristic genes of three important
  metabolic pathways. (B) The KM curves of survival analysis for each subtype. (C)
  PCA of different subtypes. (D) A heat map of the gene expression in the important
  metabolic enrichment pathways. (E) The clinical characteristics of the two subtypes.
