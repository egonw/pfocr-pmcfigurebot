caption: 'Schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in plants.
  The different metabolites are represented in boxes. The genes that integrate the
  pathway are: ANS (anthocyanidin synthase), CHS (Chalcone synthase), CHI (Chalcone
  isomerase), CCoAOMT (Caffeoyl‐CoA O‐methyltransferase), C3H (4‐coumarate 3‐hydroxylase),
  C3’H (4‐coumaroyl shikimate/quinate 3’‐hydroxylase), C4H (Cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase),
  4CL (4‐coumaroyl CoA ligase), DFR (Dihydroflavonol 4‐reductase), F3H (Flavanone
  3‐hydroxylase), F3’H (flavonoid 3’‐hydroxylase), F3’‐5H (Flavonoid 3’ 5‐hydroxylase),
  F3’‐5’H (Flavonoid 3’ 5’‐hydroxylase), FLS (Flavonol synthase), HCT (4‐hydroxycinnamoyl
  CoA: shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase), PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase).
  The genes marked in red are those selected for transcriptional activation with dCasEV2.1
  in this work. The metabolites targeted for accumulation are shown in bold. A representation
  of each candidate gene promoter with the targeted gRNA positions is also shown.
  gRNAs assayed in the first round of optimization are shown in red, and those assayed
  in the second round are shown in blue. Red/blue striped boxes represent activation
  sites that were included in activation programmes assayed in both optimization rounds.
  The asterisks represent the gRNA position recalculated with updated information
  on the TSS available in databases (https://www.nbenth.com/).'
