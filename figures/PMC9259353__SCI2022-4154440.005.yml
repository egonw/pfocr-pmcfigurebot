caption: 'LiCl rescues the attenuation of DA on rBMSC osteogenic differentiation via
  the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. rBMSCs were pretreated with 5 mM LiCl for 2 h
  and then cultured in osteogenic medium containing 10−5 M DA. (a) ALP staining of
  rBMSCs after 7 days of differentiation. Optical photos (upper photo) and microscopic
  images (lower photo). (b) ALP activity of rBMSCs measured after 7 days of differentiation.
  (c) Calcium nodules assessed by Alizarin Red staining after 14 days of differentiation.
  Optical photos (upper photo) and microscopic images (lower photo). (d) Relative
  quantification of Alizarin Red staining. (e) Expressions of Col1a1, Alp, Runx2,
  Opn, and Ocn measured by qRT-PCR assay after 7 days of differentiation. (f, g) Expression
  of COL1A1, ALP, RUNX2, OPN, and OCN measured by western blot assay after 7 days
  of differentiation. (h) Expression of GSK-3β and p-GSK-3β measured by western blot
  assay after 24 h of differentiation. (i) Quantification of p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β ratio.
  (j, k) The expression levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic β-CATENIN analyzed by western
  blot. (j) and quantified (k) in the indicated groups after 24 h of differentiation.
  (l) The translocation of β-CATENIN in the nucleus assessed by immunofluorescence
  assay after 24 h of differentiation. β-CATENIN was stained as red and nuclei were
  stained by DAPI showing blue. Scale bar, 100 μm. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 compared
  to OM group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 compared to DA group; ns: no significance.'
