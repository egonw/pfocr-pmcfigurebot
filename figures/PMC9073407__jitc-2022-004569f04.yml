caption: NKG2A and PD-L1 expression panel correlates with molecular alterations in
  MIBC. (A and B) The landscape of genomic alterations according to NKG2A and PD-L1
  expression in TCGA cohort (A) and IMvigor210 trial (B). (C and D) the HR for overall
  survival with NKG2Ahigh PD-L1high tumors versus others in the context of pathway
  alterations and molecular subtypes representing better responses in patients with
  NKG2Ahigh PD-L1high tumors. HRs were evaluated by univariate Cox analysis in ACT
  applied patients in TCGA cohort (C) and atezolizumab-applied patients in IMvigor210
  cohort (D). *P<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. ACT, adjuvant chemotherapy; GA, gene
  alteration; HRR, homologous recombination repair; MIBC, muscle-invasive bladder
  cancer; MMR, mismatch repair; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand-1; RTK, receptor
  tyrosine kinase; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; TMB, tumor mutation burden; WT,
  wild type.
