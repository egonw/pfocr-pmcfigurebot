caption: In vitro protective effects of OEA on the model. (A–C) CCK-8 assay results
  showed the viability of H9C2 cells treated with OGD/R at different time points after
  high glucose induction (n = 12). (D) The CCK-8 assay data revealed the viability
  of H9C2 cells after 24 h of treatment with different concentrations of OEA (n =
  6). (E) The viability of H9C2 cells was analyzed by CCK-8 assay after treatment
  with different concentrations of OEA in vitro with high glucose and OGD/R (n = 12).
  (F,G) The ROS level in each group after OGD/R and OEA (40 μM) treatment was detected
  by flow cytometry (n = 3). (H) MDA level in each group after high glucose and OGD/R
  and OEA (40 μM) treatment (n = 3). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, ΩΩP < 0.01,
  ΩΩΩP < 0.001, the control group was shown in the horizontal line label; ++p < 0.01,
  +++p < 0.001 vs. OEA 0 μM group; ♦♦p < 0.01, ♦♦♦p < 0.001 vs. HG + OGD/R group;
  δδP < 0.01, δδδP< 0.001 vs. HG group.
