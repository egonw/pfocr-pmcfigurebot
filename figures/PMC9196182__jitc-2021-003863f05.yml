caption: 'Transient melanoma cell dedifferentiation upon RIG-I activation. (A–E) Ma-Mel-47
  cells were transfected once with 3pRNA or Ctrl RNA and analyzed on day 3 (3 d) and
  14 (14 d) post-transfection. (A, top) Real-time proliferation of Ma-Mel-47 after
  3pRNA (red) or Ctrl RNA (blue) transfection. Vertical gray line indicates time point
  of transfection; gray arrows show medium exchange. Representative data of three
  independent experiments. (A, bottom) Morphology and cell density monitored microscopically
  (×10 magnification). Representative images of three independent experiments. (B)
  Differentiation status determined by the expression of indicated proteins. GAPDH,
  loading control. Representative data of three independent experiments. (C, D) Melan-A
  expression determined by flow cytometry. (C) Representative histograms with dotted
  line representing unstained control and (D) fold change of MFI given as mean±SEM
  of three independent experiments. (E) RIG-I expression and JAK-STAT pathway activation
  analyzed by western blot. GAPDH, loading control. Representative data of three independent
  experiments. (F–H) 3pRNA-transfected Ma-Mel-47 were sorted for NGFR expression on
  day 3 post-transfection and cultured until reproliferation (20 d). (F) Scheme of
  workflow. Illustration created with BioRender.com. (G, top) NGFR surface expression
  before cell sorting on day 3 post-transfection. (G, bottom) Melan-A and NGFR coexpression
  in melanoma cells analyzed by flow cytometry directly after cell sorting (3 d) and
  at the time point of reproliferation on day 20 post-transfection (20 d). Representative
  dot plots with percentage of cells from two independent experiments. (H) Quantification
  of Melan-A expression given as fold change of MFI from two independent experiments.
  Linked points indicate results from the same experiment. Significantly different
  experimental groups: **p<0.01; ***p<0.005 by two-tailed paired t-test. Ctrl, control;
  MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; MITF, Microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor; NGFR, nerve growth factor receptor; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I.'
