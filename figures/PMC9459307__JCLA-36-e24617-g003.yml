caption: Correlation analysis between PAQR3 protein expression levels and epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) markers or TGF‐β/Smad signaling pathway activation. The protein
  levels of PAQR3, e‐cadherin, vimentin, Snail, TGF‐1, p‐Smad2, and p‐Smad3 were analyzed
  in GCA tissues by immunohistochemical staining. The immunohistochemical scores of
  PAQR3 in GCA tissues were plotted with those of EMT‐related markers or with key
  proteins of the TGF‐β/Smad signaling pathway. A significant positive relationship
  was found between PAQR3 protein expression in GCA tissues and E‐cadherin protein
  expression (A), but a significant negative relationship was found between PAQR3
  protein expression in GCA tissues and Vimentin protein expression (B), or Snail
  protein expression (C), or TGF‐β1 protein expression (D), or p‐Smad2 protein expression
  (E), or p‐Smad3 protein expression (F).
