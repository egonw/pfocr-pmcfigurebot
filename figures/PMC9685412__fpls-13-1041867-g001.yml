caption: KPILP is involved in CRS regulatory hub. (A) Relative amount of KPILP mRNA
  in leaves with systemic PVX infection (pPVX or pPVX(frKPILP)) as determined by qPCR.
  Mean values and standard error are presented. The data was analyzed using ANOVA.
  Bars without shared letters indicate significant differences according to Tukey’s
  HSD at p<0.05. (B) Relative amount of CRS marker genes mRNA in response to PVX infection
  and KPILP downregulation as determined by qPCR. Mean values and standard errors
  are presented. The level of mRNA accumulation for each gene in a control plant was
  taken as 1. The data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Bars with different
  letter indicate significant difference according to post-hoc Dunn’s test at p<0.05
  while bars with shared letter are not significantly different. (C) Relative amount
  of CRS marker genes mRNA in leaves 3 days after agroinfiltration with “empty” pCambia1300
  or 35S-KPILP as determined by qPCR. Mean values and standard errors are presented.
  The level of mRNA accumulation for each gene in an intact plant was taken as 1.
  Bars with different letter indicate significant difference at p<0.05 (ANOVA, Tukey’s
  HSD), while bars with shared letter are not significantly different.
