caption: 'RT-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to determine the expression levels of inflammation-related
  genes. LF represents apo-LF. Apo-LF represents individual treatment with 10 g/L
  apo-LF, LPS represents individual treatment with 1 mg/L LPS and apo-LF + LPS represents
  combined treatment with of 10 g/L apo-LF and 1 mg/L LPS. Data analyzed were presented
  as means ± SD. * means comparison with the control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001. # means comparison with the LPS group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ###
  p < 0.001.'
