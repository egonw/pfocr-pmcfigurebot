caption: 'Overview of sphingolipid metabolism. SPT: serine palmitoyltransferase; CS:
  ceramide synthase; DES: dihydroceramide desaturase; CDase: ceramidase; SK: sphingosine
  kinase; S1Pase: sphingosine-1-phosphate-phosphatase; S1P-lyase: sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase; S1PR1: sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1; CK: ceramide kinase; CPase: ceramide-1-phosphate-phosphatase;
  SMS: sphingomyelin synthase; SMase: sphingomyelinase; PC: phosphocholine; DAG: diacylglycerol;
  GluCerS: glucosylceramide synthase; LacCerS: lactosylceramide synthase; HEXs: hexosaminidases;
  NEUs: neuraminidases; GTFs: glycosyltransferases; SATs: sialyltransferases; GM2A:
  ganglioside activator protein; SAPs: sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins);
  GlucCDase: glucosylceramidase; GalCerS: galactosylceramide synthase; GalCDase: galactosylceramidase.
  Considerations: Orange arrows depict de novo pathway. Purple arrows depict salvage
  pathway. Red arrows depict SM cycle. Blue arrows depict GSL metabolism. CDase and
  SMase have acid, alkaline, and neutral isotypes, depending on the subcellular compartment.
  Multiple intracellular transporters (CERT, FAPP2, CPTP, SPNS2, Mfsd2d, GLTP) move
  newly synthesized sphingolipids across subcellular compartments to ensure proper
  distribution.'
