caption: 'FRS2 knockdown counteracts the effect of TRIM44 overexpression in EC cells
  (a) Expression of TRIM44 and FRS2 in TRIM44-overexpressing and/or FRS2-knockdown
  Ishikawa cells was assessed by Q-PCR (n = 6). (b) Expression of TRIM44 and FRS2
  in TRIM44-overexpressing and/or FRS2-knockdown Ishikawa cells was assessed by Western
  blot analysis (n = 6). (c) The proliferation of Ishikawa cells at 48 h following
  TRIM44 overexpression and/or FRS2 knockdown (n = 6). ((d), (e)) EdU proliferation
  analysis of the effect of TRIM44 overexpression and/or FRS2 knockdown on the growth
  of Ishikawa cells were compared with the control cells. ((f), (g)) The cell cycle
  was detected in Ishikawa cells following the TRIM44 overexpression and/or FRS2 knockdown
  (n = 6). ((h), (i)) Cell apoptosis was detected in TRIM44-overexpressing and/or
  FRS2-knockdown EC cells (n = 6). ((j), (k)) Transwell invasion assays were performed
  in TRIM44-overexpressing and FRS2-knockdown EC cells (n = 6). all data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. statistical significance: ∗∗, P < 0.01 compared with shNC group,
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 compared with shFRS2.'
