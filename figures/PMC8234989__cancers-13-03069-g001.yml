caption: Core components and interacting signals of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway
  in cancer. In the canonical Hippo pathway, Mst1/2 and Sav1 activate Lats1/2 and
  Mob1, which in turn phosphorylate YAP/TAZ. Then, phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are
  sequestered in the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes. Nuclear YAP/TAZ and TEAD
  complexes induce the transcription of multiple genes that regulate cell propagation
  and programmed cell death. Several growth factors, G-protein coupled receptors,
  and mechanical stimuli regulate the activation of YAP/TAZ.
