caption: Chronic social defeat stress induces an oligodendrocyte response in the hippocampal
  dorsal part in the intermediate mice. (a) Number of DEGs among the oligodendrocytes
  sub-clusters 1 to 5 in the intermediate mice compared to control mice in the dorsal
  and ventral parts of the hippocampus. (b) Top 10 GO terms analysis related to the
  DEGs identified in the dorsal hippocampus of the intermediate mice. The most relevant
  pathways are highlighted in bold. (c) Differential expression of the oligodendrocyte
  progenitor (left panel), early and mature (right panel) oligodendrocyte markers
  in the intermediate (Int) mice compared to control mice in the dorsal and ventral
  parts of the hippocampus. (d) Differential expression of oligodendrocyte genes involved
  in microglia cell activation participating in the immune response pathway in the
  intermediate mice compared to control mice in the dorsal and ventral parts of the
  hippocampus. (e) Top 10 GO terms analysis related to the DEGs identified in the
  dorsal hippocampus of the sub-cluster micros_8 of the intermediate mice. The most
  interesting pathways are highlighted in bold. (f) Differential expression of the
  genes involved in the positive regulation of the glial cell differentiation pathway
  in the microglia cluster in the intermediate mice compared to control mice in the
  dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus. (g) Proposed cell-cell interaction
  identified in the intermediate mice between oligodendrocytes (top) and microglia
  (bottom).
