caption: Inhibitory effects of TET1 on CSCs and EMT can be reversed by activating
  Wnt signaling. (A) GSEA analysis of RNA-seq data showing activation of WNT signaling
  pathway in AGS_shTET1 compared to shCtrl cells. (B) Representative pictures of spheres
  generated by stable NCI-N87 and MKN28 cell lines treated with 25 μmol/L ICG001 or
  DMSO solvent as control. Scale bars represent 100 µm. (C) Numbers of spheres per
  100 cells treated as in (B). (D) Representative pictures of spheres generated by
  stable HGC27 and MKN45 cell lines transfected with constitutively active ΔN-β-catenin
  or empty vector as control. Scale bars represent 100 µm. (E) Numbers of spheres
  generated per 100 cells treated as in (D). (F) qRT-PCR analysis of the cancer stem
  cell markers in MKN28 stable cell lines treated with 25 μmol/L ICG001, 30 μmol/L
  LF or DMSO solvent as control. MKN28_shCtrl cells treated with DMSO solvent were
  used as control. (G) qRT-PCR analysis of the cancer stem cell markers in HGC27 stable
  cell lines treated with DMSO solvent as control, Chir, or transfected with ΔN-β-catenin.
  HGC27_Ctrl cells treated with DMSO solvent were used as control. (H) IF staining
  of β-actin (by phalloidin), E-cadherin, and vimentin in MKN28 stable cell lines
  with the indicated treatments. Scale bars represent 100 µm. (I) IF staining of β-actin
  (by phalloidin), E-cadherin, and vimentin in HGC27 stable cell lines with transient
  transfection. Scale bars represent 100 µm. (J) qRT-PCR analysis of the EMT markers
  in MKN28 stable cell lines as in (F). (K) qRT-PCR analysis of the EMT markers in
  HGC27 stable cell lines as in (G). (L) Representative pictures of β-catenin IHC
  staining in normal tissue, primary tumors and lymph node metastases of gastric cancer
  patients. Scale bars represent 100 µm. Error bars indicate mean ± SD. ***, p < 0.001.
  *, p < 0.05.
