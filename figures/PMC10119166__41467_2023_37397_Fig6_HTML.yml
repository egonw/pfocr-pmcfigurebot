figure_title: Sema3C confers resistance to Wnt inhibition
caption: a Western blots of TCF1 and c-Myc in GSCs treated with Porcupine inhibitor
  LGK974. Cells were treated with LGK974 or vehicle control for 24 h. b Western blots
  of TCF1 in LGK974 treated GSCs expressing FLAG vector or FLAG-Sema3C. Cells were
  treated with LGK974 100 μM or vehicle control for 24 h. Source data are provided
  as a Source data file. Western blots were repeated at least twice.
