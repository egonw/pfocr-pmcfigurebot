caption: (A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for Hepatocytes
  (HEP1 n=13,951, HEP2 n=11,187,HEP3 n=9,956, HEP4 n=9,241, HEP5 n=4,056, HEP6 n=1,612,
  HEP7 n=1,602). (B) Heatmap capturing the expression of marker genes across the hepatocyte
  and the biliary epithelial cell compartments. (C) Slingshot pseudotime values (left)
  projected on the 2 primary harmony embeddings across 5 lineages for hepatocyte and
  biliary epithelial cells from COVID-19 and healthy liver nuclei. The starting and
  ending lineage points are represented with green and red, respectively. Slingshot-derived
  lineages (right), coupled with cell composition fold-change differences between
  healthy and COVID-19 liver samples on a log2 scale. (D) Cell proportion differences
  between COVID-19 and healthy liver samples. Significantly different proportions
  are marked in red (higher in COVID-19), in blue (higher in Controls), and denoted
  with *(* FDR < 0.05, ** FDR < 0.01; Binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model). COVID-19-specific
  clusters are denoted with dark red. (E) Abundance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ nuclei in the
  snRNAseq clusters. The bars are colored by the scaled viral enrichment score estimated
  per cluster. Significantly enriched clusters are marked in red and denoted with
  * (* FDR < 0.05, ** FDR < 0.01; Viral enrichment test). (F) Uniform manifold approximation
  and projection (UMAP) plots depicting the average expression of different heat shock
  proteins (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA5, HSPA6, HSPA9, HSPB1, HSPD1) in Hepatocytes (upper
  left), pathway activity scores for GO term “regulation of type I interferon-mediated
  signaling pathway” (GO:0060338, bottom left), the viral load in all the cellular
  compartments (upper right), in Hepatocytes (lower middle), and the average expression
  on NFKB1 in Hepatocytes (lower right).
