figure_title: MXD1 silencing mitigates the inhibition of HOXA5 overexpression on the
  proliferation of ECCA cells
caption: A, B MXD1 silencing did reduce MXD1, but not HOXA5 expression, and partially
  rescued the expression of mitosis-related genes in ECCA cells. C–E MXD1 silencing
  abrogated the inhibition of HOXA5 overexpression on the cell cycle and proliferation
  of ECCA cells. F MXD1 silencing partially rescued the tumor volumes in the HOXA5
  over-expressing ECCA tumors from nude mice. G Immunohistochemistry analysis of MXD1
  and Ki67 expression in xenograft tumors from nude mice. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001.
  Orange bar, 50 μm. Green bar, 20 μm.
