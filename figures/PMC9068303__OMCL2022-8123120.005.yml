caption: ZQL-4c inhibits cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. MCF-7,
  MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 μmol/L ZQL-4c
  for 24 h. (a) A pipette tip was used to scratch the cultured cells and the width
  of the scratch was measured. Untreated cancer cultures of each cell line were used
  as negative controls. (b) The wound surface area was quantified by Image J software.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean of three independent
  experiments performed in triplicate (n = 3; ∗P < 0.05).
