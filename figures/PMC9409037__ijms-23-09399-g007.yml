caption: 'Effects of GcvB on valine/leucine/isoleucine biosynthetic pathway. (A) Relative
  expression of genes (ilvC, ilvD, ilvE) involved in the valine/leucine/isoleucine
  biosynthetic pathway by qRT-PCR (Student ’s t-test, p value: **, <0.01). The levels
  of gcvB were normalized to the internal control 16S rRNA level. Error bars indicate
  standard deviations; (B) Western blot detection of IlvG translational fusion. For
  Western blotting, samples were harvested at OD600nm of 0.3~0.4 (early-log), 1.0~1.5
  (mid-log), and 3.0~4.0 (stationary) from LBS plus 5 μg/mL Cm (chloramphenicol).
  Polyclonal anti-Dnak was used as loading control.'
