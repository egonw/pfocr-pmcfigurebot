caption: DHA suppressed the NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signal pathways in TNFα-treated NPCs.
  (a) Western blotting of NF-κB pathway proteins in TNFα-treated NPCs with or without
  DHA for 72 hours. (b) Nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (red) was determined by
  immunofluorescence staining in TNFα-treated NPCs with or without DHA for 30 min.
  DAPI (blue) indicated nuclei. Yellow arrowheads indicated cytoplasmic distribution
  of NF-κB p65. Scale bar =25 μm. (c) Western blotting of PI3K pathway proteins in
  TNFα-treated NPCs with or without DHA for 72 hours. (d) Model of DHA. (e) Ribbon
  model of PI3K. (f–g) Space filling model between DHA and PI3K and reaction between
  DHA and PI3K.
