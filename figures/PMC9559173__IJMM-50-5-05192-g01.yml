caption: Grifola frondosa polysaccharides (GFPs) suppress the growth of MCF-7 tumor
  xenografts in nude mice. Male BALB/c athymic nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumors were
  treated for 14 days. (A) MCF-7 tumor xenograft growth between GFP-treated and untreated
  nude mice. (B) GFPs exerted no significant effects on body weight among the experimental
  mice. (C) Growth curves of MCF-7 tumor xenografts in GFP-treated and untreated mice.
  Tumor sizes were measured every 2 days. Data are expressed as the means Â± SD (n=3)
  and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. controls. (D) GFPs
  downregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins and upregulated the pro-apoptotic proteins
  in tumor tissues from treated mice. The average fold of band intensity compared
  with the untreated mice was marked respectively (n=3).
