caption: 'The expression of skeletal muscle homogenate inflammatory factors was detected
  by ELISA. (A-D) After 4 weeks of treatment, the expression of inflammatory factors
  in the skeletal muscle homogenate of rats in each group was detected by ELISA (n=6–7
  each group). ***, P<0.001, relative to the normal control group; #, P<0.05, ##,
  P<0.01, and ###, P<0.001 relative to the D-gal group; ^^, P<0.01 relative to the
  DA group. TNF, tumor necrosis factor; D-gal, D-galactose; A, acupuncture; N, non-acupoint;
  IL, interleukin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DA, D-gal acupuncture.'

  pathway in rats with sarcopenia induced by D-galactose.
