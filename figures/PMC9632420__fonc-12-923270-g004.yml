caption: USP8 regulates the NF-κB pathway and docetaxel-mediated NF-κB activation
  in PCa. (A) The DU145 and PC3 cells were transfected or treated with siUSP8 and
  docetaxel IC50 individually or combined, and for Western blotting, complete protein
  was obtained. Antibodies to the indicated proteins (USP8, EGFR, PI3K, IKKα, IKBα,
  P-IKBα, p65, P-p65) were used to detect their expression. As a control, GAPDH was
  employed. (B) ImageJ was used to compute the relative gray value of the blots. The
  results were standardized using GAPDH as a loading control (individual protein/GAPDH)
  and shown as mean ± SD from three replicated experiments (n = 3, *p < 0.05). (C)
  The DU145 and PC3 cells were treated with USP8-overexpressing plasmid and docetaxel
  IC50 individually or combinedly, and for Western blotting, complete protein was
  obtained. Antibodies to the indicated proteins (USP8, EGFR, PI3K, IKKα, IKBα, P-IKBα,
