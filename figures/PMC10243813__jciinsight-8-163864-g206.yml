figure_title: Loss of Dnmt3a in BMNC results in increased cell proliferation via the
  PI3K pathway
caption: (A) WT and Dnmt3afl/fl:Mx-Cre mice were administered poly I:C at 12–16 weeks
  of age, and BMNCs were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect the presence
  of DNMT3a protein. Two independent WT and Dnmt3a–/– mouse–derived BMNCs were utilized
  for these experiments. (B) BMNCs from WT or Dnmt3a–/– mice were cultured in media
  supplemented with SCF (50 ng/mL) or IL-3 (10 ng/mL) or no growth factor for 48 hours.
  Cell proliferation was evaluated by [3H] thymidine incorporation. Counts per minute
  (CPM) are shown. Three independent experiments, n = 6, mean ± SD, ****P < 0.00005.
  BM cells collected from WT or Dnmt3a–/– mice were subjected to RNA isolation and,
  subsequently, next-generation sequencing. (C and D) GSEA revealed an enrichment
  for genes in the PI3K signaling pathway (C), and upregulation of specific genes
  in the PI3K pathway are shown in the heatmap (D). (E) BMNCs from WT or Dnmt3a–/–
  mice were starved of growth factors and stimulated with SCF, followed by Western
  blot analysis. (F) Class I PI3K complex is composed of p85 regulatory subunit and
  p110α, p110β, and p110δ catalytic subunits. Activated PI3K signaling regulates AKT
  phosphorylation, which in turn promotes cell grow, cell survival, and proliferation.
  (G) WT, Dnmt3afl/fl:Mx-Cre, and Dnmt3afl/fl:p85αfl/fl:Mx-Cre mice were administered
  poly I:C at 12–16 weeks of age. BMNCs were collected from 3 different mice of each
  genotype and stimulated with SCF (25 ng/mL or 50 ng/mL) or in the absence of growth
  factors for 48 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated by [3H] thymidine incorporation.
  Counts per minute (CPM) are shown. Experiment performed 3 times, and representative
  experiment shown with n = 4, mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, ****P < 0.00005.
  Two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (B and C).
