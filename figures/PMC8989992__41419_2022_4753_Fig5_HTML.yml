figure_title: NGF promotes the SorCS3 and p75NTR interaction
caption: 'A U87 cells were transfected SorCS3-Flag plasmid, and then stimulated or
  not with NGF (100 ng/mL) for 60 min. IP were performed using anti-Flag antibody,
  and the immunocomplexes were immunoblotted (IB) using anti-p75NTR antibody. In parallel,
  immunoblots for p75NTR were performed on whole-cell lysates (wcl); the isotypic
  lane Immunoglobulin G (IgG) represents the IP control. B–E U87 overexpression of
  SorCS3 and control were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/mL) over 0–120 min time course.
  Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for components of the canonical internalization
  signaling pathway using the indicated antibodies. *p vs. the control group, #p vs.
  the OE-SorCS3 (NGF, 0 min) group. ns: not statistically significant. F Process of
  internalization was visualized by immunofluorescence staining of the endosome and
  the lysosomal marker. U87 cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/mL) for 60 min,
  and then immunofluorescence for SorCS3-Flag, p75NTR, early endosome markers (Rab5)
  and lysosome markers (Lamp1 and Lamp2). Scale bar: 17 µm. G–M U87 were transfected
  with SorCS3-Flag plasmid or siRNA (si-SorCS3-2#) and the corresponding control,
  and then stimulated with NGF (100 ng/mL) for 60 min. Cell lysates were analyzed
  by western blotting with the indicated antibodies, using β-actin as an endogenous
  control. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. including three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
