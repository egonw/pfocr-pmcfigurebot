caption: 'NCLX regulates the expression of transcription factors and metabolic genes.A,
  volcano plot comparing differentially expressed genes between shScramble and shNCLX
  #3 HASMCs. Genes are plotted by log2 fold change and −log10 false discovery rate
  (FDR), with a threshold of an FDR <0.05 (dotted black line). In the shNCLX #3 samples,
  significantly upregulated and downregulated genes are light red and light blue,
  respectively. B, pathway analysis of A using the Reactome pathways gene set ranking
  significantly upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) pathways based on normalized
  enrichment score (NES). C–H, GSEA enrichment plots using the Reactome pathways gene
  set comparing shNCLX #3 and shScramble HASMCs showing a negative correlation in
  the enrichment of (C) translation, (D) cell cycle checkpoints, (E) metabolism of
  amino acids and derivatives, (F) metabolism of nucleotides, and (G) glycolysis.
  For each GSEA enrichment plot, NES and FDR values are displayed. H, heatmap comparing
  expression of select genes from RNA sequencing of shScramble and shNCLX#2 HASMCs.

  0.0300 for shNCLX #3), mRNA expression in shScramble (n = 5), shNCLX #2 (n = 5),
