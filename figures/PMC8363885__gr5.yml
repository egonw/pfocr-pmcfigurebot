caption: FAM60A regulates glioma cell proliferation through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathways. (A) Western blot analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway downstream
  response genes and HDAC1 protein expression in FAM60A-silenced U251 cells. β-actin
  is adopted as a loading control. (B) Western blot analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway downstream response genes and HDAC1 protein expression in FAM60A-silenced
  LN382 cells. β-actin is adopted as a loading control. (C) Western blot analysis
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway downstream response genes and HDAC1 protein
  expression in CPTH2 treatment on FAM60A-silenced U251 cells. β-actin is adopted
  as a loading control. (D) Western blot analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  downstream response genes and HDAC1 protein expression in CPTH2 treatment on FAM60A-silenced
  LN382 cells. β-actin is adopted as a loading control.
