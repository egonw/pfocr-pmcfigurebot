caption: The effect of HS3ST1 on SPOP/FADD/NF-κB signaling. (a) SPOP protein expression
  in the form of representative images, FADD, and p-p65 in A549 cells. (b) Results
  of expression of SPOP, FADD, and p-p65 in A549 cells. (c) The effects of SPOP overexpression
  or knockdown on the mRNA expression of FADD. (d) The effects of SPOP overexpression
  and a proteasome inhibitor MG-132 on the protein expression of FADD and p-p65 in
  A549 cells. (e) The quantity levels of FADD and p-p65 in A549 cells. (f) The protein
  levels of FADD in NSCLC tumor and adjoining normal samples. (f) The protein levels
  of p-p65inNSCLC tumor and adjacent normal samples. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to control,
  N = 12.
