figure_title: Alox15−/− AMs are senescent
caption: a, Scheme of BAL-isolated AMs from adult (6–8 weeks) WT and Alox15−/− mice.
  b,c, Heatmap of selected mRNA transcripts of cell cycle inhibitors (b) and expression
  of Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a (c) in adult WT and Alox15−/− AMs (n = 3 (WT) or 4 (Alox15−/−)).
  d, Representative micrographs of SA-β-galactosidase expression assessed by colorimetric
  or fluorescence assays. Scale bars, 25 µm (left) and 50 µm (right). e,f, Representative
  curves (left) and quantification (right) of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (e)
  and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (f) (n = 3 biological replicates/group).
  g–i, Scheme of experiment (g), Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a expression (h) (n = 3 biological
  replicates per group) and SA-β-galactosidase expression (i) in AMs from PND3 WT
  and Alox15−/− mice. Scale bars, 25 µm (left) and 50 µm (right). j–l, Scheme of experiment
  (j), heatmap of selected mRNA transcripts of the prostanoid pathway (k) and expression
  of Ptgs1 (l) from adult WT and Alox15−/− AMs (n = 3 (WT) or 4 (Alox15−/−)) in bulk
  RNA-seq. m, PGE2 production by resting AMs (24 h) from WT and Alox15−/− mice (n = 4
  biological replicates per group). n,o, Scheme of experiment (n) and Ptgs1 and Ptgs2
  expression (o) by AMs from WT and Alox15−/− PND3 mice (n = 3 biological replicates
  per group). p, PGE2 production by resting AMs (24 h) from WT and Alox15−/− PND3
  mice (n = 3 biological replicates per group). q, BAL AMs were isolated from adult
  (6–8 weeks) WT mice, and the AMs were cultured with or without GM-CSF (20 ng ml–1)
  for 3 days and treated or with or without 10 µM of exogenous PGE2. r,s, Cdkn1a and
  Cdkn2a expression (e) (n = 3 biological replicates per group) and SA-β-galactosidase
  expression (s). Scale bar, 50 µm. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. and are
  from one experiment (b,c,k–l) or from three (e,f,h,o,p,r) or four (m) independent
  experiments, or representative of two (d,l,s) independent experiments. Data were
  analysed using unpaired (c,l,m,p) or paired (e,f) two-tailed t-test or two-way ANOVA
  followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test (h,o,r). The models in a, g, j and
  n were created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).
