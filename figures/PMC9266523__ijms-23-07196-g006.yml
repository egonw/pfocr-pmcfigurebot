caption: 'Effect of the dietary supplementation with Cys on the response to treatment
  with APAP for 18 d. (A) Experimental design: Ctrl and APAP diets were supplemented
  with alanine (Ala) or cysteine (Cys). Ala was added to make diets iso-nitrogenous
  to Cys diets. The APAP-Cys group was fed ad libitum. The three other groups were
  pair-fed with the APAP-Cys group. (B) Mean daily food intake for 1–18 d. (C) Body
  weight change during the experiment. (D) Plasma cyst(e)ine concentration at 18 d.
  Each bar shows the median with interquartile and dots are individual values. **
  p ≤ 0.01; **** p ≤ 0.0001 vs. Ala; ## p ≤ 0.01; ### p ≤ 0.001 vs. respective Ala
  group; Mann Whitney test.'
