caption: ZFP64 promotes GBC cells in vitro and in vivo invasion, proliferation, EMT,
  and migration. (A,B) Transwell assays were conducted to detect the migration and
  invasion ability of GBC cells overexpressing ZFP64 (A) or knocking down ZFP64 (B)
  compared with control group, respectively. (C,D) EdU assays were used to determine
  the proliferation ability of GBC cells overexpressing ZFP64 (C) or knocking down
  ZFP64 (D). (E) Western blot analyzed the expression level of proteins related to
  apoptosis, proliferation, and EMT. (F,G) Tumors from ZFP64 knockdown group (F),
  ZFP64 overexpressing group (G), and control group were dissected from BALB/C nude
  mice after transplantation, and the weight and volume were measured. (n = 6, 2 ×
  106 cells per mouse). All data were assessed using unpaired Student’s t test, one-way
  ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA, as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. See  for
  original western blots.
