caption: The role of hyperglycemia in the suppression of autophagy and induction of
  apoptosis and necroptosis in diabetic nephropathy. Hyperglycemia causes overproduction
  of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which inhibit autophagy, leading to diabetic
  nephropathy. Hyperglycemia induces reactive oxygen species generation, which initiates
  apoptosis. Hyperglycemia also increases tumor suppressor p53 messenger ribonucleic
  acid (mRNA) and protein expression, thus activating the transcription of many pro-apoptotic
  proteins that stimulate the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Additionally,
  hyperglycemia stimulates renin-angiotensin, which is involved in apoptosis and is
  involved in diabetic nephropathy. Hyperglycemia can also trigger necroptosis in
  diabetic nephropathy via activating the interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1)-
  RIPK3 signaling pathway. This figure was generated using Microsoft PowerPoint Software,
