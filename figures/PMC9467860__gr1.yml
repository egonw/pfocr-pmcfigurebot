caption: Phylogenetic analysis of oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) from Zea mays and
  other OCSs from diverse plant species. The tree was constructed via the neighbor-joining
  algorithm. Accession numbers are provided in . Monocotyledonous OSCs are marked
  in blue, and Zea mays OSCs (ZmOSCs) in red. The other OSCs derived from dicotyledonous
  are shown in black. Cycloartenol synthases are shown in green; Î²-amyrin synthases
  are shown in orange. Multifunctional OSCs are marked with an asterisk.
article_title: Identification of a novel multifunctional oxidosqualene cyclase from
  Zea mays sheds light on the biosynthetic pathway of three pentacyclic triterpenoids.
