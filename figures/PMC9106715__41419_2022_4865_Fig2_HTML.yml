figure_title: RP1-59D14.5 activates the Hippo pathway in PCa cells
caption: A The activities of various pathways were detected by luciferase reporter
  assays. B, C RT-qPCR was used to detect mRNA levels of LATS1/2, CK1, and western
  blot analyzing protein levels of LATS1/2, CK1, TAZ, YAP, and p-YAP in RP1-59D14.5-overexpressed
  PCa cells. **P < 0.01.
article_title: RP1-59D14.5 triggers autophagy and represses tumorigenesis and progression
  of prostate cancer via activation of the Hippo signaling pathway.
