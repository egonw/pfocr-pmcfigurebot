caption: The schematic diagram is summarizing the actions of the intervention of C.
  anthelminticum seed oil on Nrf-2/HO-1 and NF-ĸB pathways. Upon exposure to oxidative,
  inflammatory, and glycemic stress expression levels of Nrf-2 increase and it translocates
  into the nucleus where it binds ARE to activate the expression of the HO-1 (antioxidant)
  gene (red arrow). Similarly, NF-ĸB is also translocated from the cytosol to the
  nucleus, where it activates the transcription of genes that include TNF-α, and IL-1β
  (red arrow). Following treatment with C. anthelminticum seed oil and its fractions,
  NF-ĸB activation is downregulated and it is reflected in the decrease in expression
  levels of Nrf-2/HO-1 to near normal (green arrow). Nrf-2-driven transcription of
  HO-1 is normalized which attempts to mitigate oxidative stress (green arrow). The
  perturbations of both NF-ĸB and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling points to putative cross-talk
  occurring between the two. However, the mechanism of this process in kidney disease
  remains unknown
