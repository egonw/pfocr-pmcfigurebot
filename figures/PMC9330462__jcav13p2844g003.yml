caption: LINC00460 facilitated RCC cells migration, invasion in vitro. (A, B, C, D)
  The cell migration and invasion abilities of ACHN and 786-O cells transfected with
  overexpressed or silenced LINC00460 were determined by Transwell assays (*** p<0.001).
  (E, F, G, H) Wound healing assay was performed to examine the effect of LINC00460
  overexpression or knockdown on ACHN and 786-O cells migration (* p<0.05, *** p<0.001).
  (I, J) EMT markers was detected by Western blot analysis when silenced LINC00460
  was transfected in RCC cells. Data statistics was also shown (GAPDH as negative
  control, *p < 0.05, *** p<0.001).
