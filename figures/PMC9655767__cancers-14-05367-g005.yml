caption: 'Machine learning approach to narrow down the critical genes regulated via
  SETD8/H4K20 methylation in endometrial cancer. (A) H4K20me1 ChIP-seq tag densities
  across different experiments. Density plot of the genomic region is shown as the
  read count per million mapped reads on the y-axis from 2000 bp upstream of the TSS
  to 2000 bp downstream of the transcription end site (TES) on the x-axis. The results
  for HEC50B cells treated with negative control siRNA (siNC, red line) or SETD8-targeting
  siRNA (#1 or #2, blue lines) are shown. Input is represented by the grey line. (B)
  Volcano plots illustrating DEGs (FDR < 0.05, red dots). H4K20me1 target genes annotated
  between 0â€“2 kb from TSS are shown as large circles. TP73 and KIAA1324 genes are
  indicated by the arrows. (C) Flowchart for narrowing down important genes using
  AI. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results identified genes regulated via SETD8/H4K20 methylation.
  TCGA database was used to narrow down the genes related to OS and DFS prognosis
  of endometrial cancer using the random forest method. (D) The important genes regulated
  by SETD8 and related to the prognosis of endometrial cancer were identified using
  random forest method. (E) H4K20me1 occupancy at the KIAA1324 or TP73 gene promoter
  regions. HEC50B cells for ChIP-qPCR were treated with negative-control siRNA (NC)
  or SETD8-targeting siRNAs (SETD8 #1 and #2), respectively. Bar plots are shown as
  fold enrichment from Input (y-axis). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
