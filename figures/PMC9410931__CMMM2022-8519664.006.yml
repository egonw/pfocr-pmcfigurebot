caption: circ_0041795 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway by the miR-589-5p/YAP1
  axis. (a, b) The protein expression of YAP1 was examined via western blot after
  transfection of si-circ_0041795, si-circ_0041795+anti-miR-589-5p, or relative controls
  in HG-treated ARPE-19 cells. (c) Western blot was conducted for protein determination
  of p-P65/P65 and p-lκBα/lκBα after HG-treated ARPE-19 cells were transfected with
  si-circ_0041795, si-circ_0041795+anti-miR-589-5p, si-circ_0041795+YAP1, or corresponding
  controls. Two-way ANOVA was used in (c), and one-way ANOVA was used in other graphs.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
