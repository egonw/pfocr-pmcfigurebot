figure_title: CellChat interaction pathways between CD8+ T cells and myeloid cells
caption: a. Dotplot displaying average expression of genes describing the different
  dendritic cell and macrophage clusters. DC-M indicates myeloid-derived dendritic
  cell (DC); DC-P indicates plasmacytoid DC; M-PROL indicates proliferating macrophages;
  M-Inf indicates inflammatory macrophage; M-TREM2 indicates TREM2hi macrophages.
  b. Heatmaps displaying outgoing (Ligand) and incoming (Receptor) signalling patterns
  of pathways describing potential ligand-receptor interactions. Scale above heatmap
  indicates the relative signalling strength of a cell cluster based on all signalling
  pathways displayed in the heatmap. Grey bars right of the heatmap show the total
  signalling strength of a pathway in all cell clusters. The relative signalling strength
  indicated by ranging color from white (low) to green (high). All cells included
  in these graphs originate from the plaque.
