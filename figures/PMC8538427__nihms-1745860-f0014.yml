caption: HPDL-dependent CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway. The canonical tyrosine catabolism,
  HPDL-dependent (red), and HPDL-independent (purple) CoQ10 biosynthetic pathways
  are shown as indicated. The HPDL-independent pathway was proposed from earlier studies
  in rats. Dotted lines represent unknown pathway or transport steps. Potential intermediates
  and enzymes are proposed within the 4-HMA, HPDL-dependent and-independent pathways.
