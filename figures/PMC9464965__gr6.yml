caption: 'Mouse islets cells are susceptible to TNFα-induced cell death when cIAPs
  or caspases are inhibited. A) Mouse islet cells express components of the TNFα signaling
  pathway at the RNA and B) protein levels. C) Mouse islet cell death was quantified
  24 h post treatment relative to t = 0 (n = 8). Cell culture treatment conditions
  are indicated by color (black: vehicle, blue: 40 ng/ml TNFα, purple: TNFα + 5 μM
  BV6, green: TNFα + 50 μM zVAD, white: TNFα+BV6+zVAD. D) Mouse islet cell caspase
  3/7 activity was quantified 24 h post treatment and expressed relative to vehicle
  treated cells (n = 4). E) Representative IncuCyte images illustrate Sytox green
  positive mouse islet cells 24 h post treatment. F) Mouse islet cell death was quantified
  24 h after treatment with vehicle, TNFα or TNFα+zVAD in the absence (left) or in
  the presence (right) of the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK’872 (5 μM, n = 3–5). G) Mouse islet
  cell caspase 3/7 activity was quantified 24 h after treatment with vehicle, TNFα
  or TNFα+zVAD in the absence (left) or in the presence (right) of the RIPK3 inhibitor
  GSK’872 (n = 4). H) Mouse genotyping and islet immunoblot analysis confirmed loss
  of RIPK3 expression in Ripk3−/− compared to Ripk3+/+ mice. I) Basal cell death rate
  was quantified in Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mouse islet cells (n = 5–6). J) Ripk3−/−
  mouse islet cell death was monitored for 24 h and quantified 24 h post treatment
  relative to t = 0 (n = 4). K) Mouse islet cell caspase 3/7 activity was quantified
  24 h post treatment and expressed relative to vehicle treated cells (n = 4). Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM and were analyzed by Student''s t-test or one-way ANOVA
  followed by Sidák post-test and multiple comparisons correction, as described. ∗p < 0.05;
  ∗∗p < 0.01; ns, p > 0.05 as indicated. (For interpretation of the references to
  color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
