caption: Blocking CD40L-CD40-TRAF6 signaling pathway improved intestinal barrier function
  in septic mice. Compound 6877002 (10 μmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 2 h
  prior to and at 12 h after CLP to block the CD40-TRAF6 signaling pathway. 24 h after
  CLP, mice were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected. a The survival percentage
  of the mice was investigated within 7 days after CLP by survival curves (n = 10).
  Intestinal barrier permeability was indicated by serum FITC-Dextran levels (b) (n = 6),
  water content (c) of gut (n = 6), and colony-forming units (CFUs) (d–f) from mesenteric
  lymph node (MLN), liver and lung (n = 6). g, h Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
  and pathological score, Scale bar = 100 μm (n = 6). i, j Western blot analysis of
  ZO-1 and occludin expression (n = 6). k, l TNF-α and IL-1β levels in intestinal
  tissues (n = 6). m, n Immunofluorescence staining analysis of ZO-1 (red), Scale
  bar = 50 μm (n = 6). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
