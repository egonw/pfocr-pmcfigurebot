caption: PDIA4 induces proliferative effects in TNBC cells with/without IR. A and
  B Surviving fraction of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with a single dose
  of radiation (0–8 Gy) after downregulation of PDIA4 or overexpression of PDIA4,
  measured 2 weeks with/without IR. C and D CCK-8 assay was used to assess the proliferation
  of knockdown or overexpression of PDIA4 TNBC cells with/without IR. All data are
  shown as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. The P values
  were calculated using unpaired Student’s t test. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001
