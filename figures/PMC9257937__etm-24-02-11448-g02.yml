caption: Macrophage polarization is inhibited by HCVc via TLR2 signaling. Expression
  levels of (A) CD209 in M2a macrophages, (B) CD86 in M2b macrophages and (C) CD163
  in M2c macrophages were decreased by exposure to HCVc or Pam3CSK4. Secretion levels
  of (D) IL-1RA in M2a macrophages, (E) TNF-α in M2b macrophages and (F) TGF-β in
  M2c macrophages were decreased by exposure to HCVc or Pam3CSK4. mRNA expression
  levels of (G) Fizz1 in M2a macrophages, (H) TNF-α in M2b macrophages and (I) SPHK1
  in M2c macrophages were decreased by exposure to HCVc or Pam3CSK4. (A-I) Blockade
  of the TLR2 signaling pathway using a TLR2 antibody partially restored macrophage
  polarization. Representative histograms of three independent experiments are shown.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; HCVc, hepatitis
  C virus core protein; W/O, control group (W/O, without stimulant; other groups received
  HCVc, Pam3CSK4 and TLR2 antibody); IL-1RA, IL-1 receptor antagonist; SPHK1, sphingosine
  kinase 1; TLR2, Toll-like receptor 2.
