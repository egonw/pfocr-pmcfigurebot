caption: Overexpression of KLF4 attenuated ERS in bleomycin-induced fibrosis. HFL-1
  fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in the KLF4-overexpressing group and the control
  group. Total protein was extracted at multiple time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
  18, and 24 h). Protein immunoblotting was performed to examine the expression levels
  of p-IRE1α, ATF6, and BIP, with β-tubulin as a reference, as shown in (a). Mice
  were injected with bleomycin to induce pulmonary fibrosis. Tissue RNA was extracted
  from the KLF4-overexpressing mice group and the wild-type group treated with normal
  saline as a control and subjected to the RT-qPCR test to detect the mRNA expression
  of p-IRE1α, ATF6, and BIP (b,c). The values are expressed as mean ± SD from six
  samples in each group. ns implies no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001, as determined by t-test.
