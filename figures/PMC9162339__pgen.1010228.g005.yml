figure_title: CMAP analyses identifies GSK3 inhibition as a therapeutic mechanism
caption: A) Ten compounds were predicted to mimic the transcriptional response due
  to dNGLY1 knockdown in flies []. In the mouse liver data set, 193 compounds were
  predicted to mimic the transcriptional response due to the loss of Ngly1 []. The
  fly and mouse data sets shared six compounds, three of which are proteasome inhibitors.
  B) In the fly dataset, 30 compounds were predicted to counter the transcriptional
  response due to dNGLY1 knockdown. In the mouse liver dataset, 195 compounds were
  predicted to counter the transcriptional response due to loss of Ngly1. The GSK3
  inhibitor TWS119 was the only compound shared between the two data sets. C) TWS119
  rescued the lethality of Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi flies at 1 μM but did not rescue lethality
  at 5 or 25 μM. D) Lithium chloride (LiCl) showed a dose response effect and significantly
  rescued lethality in Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi flies at 0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM. The lowest
  dose at 0.01 mM did not increase survival of Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi flies. E) Sgg-RNAi
  did not impact lethality in heterozygous dNGLY1ΔGAL4/+ flies. However, sgg-RNAi
  rescued lethality in dNGLY1ΔGAL4/pl flies that lack functional dNGLY1. **** p <
  0.0001, ** p < 0.01.
