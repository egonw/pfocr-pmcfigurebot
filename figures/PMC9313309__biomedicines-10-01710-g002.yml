caption: Mechanism of AOM/DSS-induced mouse model. (A) Molecular alterations in different
  stages of AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis. AOM/DSS treatment induces the progression
  from polyps/ACFs and adenomas to adenocarcinomas. Different genes are correlated
  with each stage of AOM/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. (B) Mechanism of AOM/DSS-induced
  colon tumorigenesis. AOM induces DNA methylation and activates or mutates cancer-related
  pathways to initiate tumorigenesis. DSS treatment upregulates Il-6 and Tnf-α expressions
  in the colon. SphK1, which is induced by Tnf-α, drives the NF-кB/Stat3 pro-inflammatory
  pathway to induce inflammation and promote tumorigenesis. AOM, azoxymethane; Apc,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium;
  Il-6, interleukin-6; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; Kras, Kirsten rat sarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog; NF-кB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; p53, tumor protein p53; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; S1PR1, sphingosine
  1-phosphate receptor-1; SphK1, sphingosine kinase 1; Stat3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; Tnf-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; Wnt, wingless-related
  integration site.
