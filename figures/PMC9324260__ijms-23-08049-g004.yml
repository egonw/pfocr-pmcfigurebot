caption: 'Effects of YOH on ERK1/2, p38, AKT, and PLCγ1 pathway activation in PDGF-BB-stimulated
  MOVAS-1 cells. MOVAS-1 cells were incubated with YOH (10 or 20 μM) for 45 min and
  then treated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) for 10 min. The protein expression levels of
  (A) phospho-ERK1/2, (B) phospho-p38, (C) phospho-AKT, (D) phospho-PLCγ1, and (E)
  phospho-(Ser) PKC substrates were determined through Western blotting. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 compared with the resting group; #p < 0.05 compared with the positive
  group. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 3).'
