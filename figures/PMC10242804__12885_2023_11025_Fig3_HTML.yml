caption: Migration and invasion capabilities of A172 and U251 cells that were infected
  by different viruses in the transwell experiment. (A, C) Cell migration phenomenon
  in all groups. (B, D) Cell invasion performance in all groups. (E, F) Migration
  and invasion numbers analysis of A172 cells in each group. Migration and invasion
  capabilities of A172 cells are enhanced by AQP8 overexpression and reduced by AQP8
  knockdown. (G, H) Migration and invasion numbers analysis of U251 cells in each
  group. Migration and invasion capabilities of U251 cells were enhanced by AQP8 overexpression
  (O.E) and reduced by AQP8 knockdown (K.D) compared with control group (vs. control,
  *p < 0.05). AQP, aquaporin; NC, negative control; O.E, overexpressed; K.D, knockdown.
  All experiments were performed in triplicate
article_title: AQP8 promotes glioma proliferation and growth, possibly through the
  ROS/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.
