caption: The role of organelles in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABA biosynthesis
  is initiated in chloroplasts by the non-mevalonate (MEP−) pathway and continuous
  via phytoene, lycopene, β-carotene, and zeaxanthin biosynthesis. The xanthophyll
  cycle converts zeaxanthin into violaxanthin, which is converted into xanthoxin.
  In the cytosol, xanthoxin is the substrate for the synthesis of ABA aldehyde and
  finally ABA. ABA is perceived through receptors from the RCAR/PYR/PYL family and
  PP2C co-receptors, which in turn activate SnRK2s and ABFs by phosphorylation. Chloroplast
  signals and functions, such as the SAL–PAP pathway and NPQ, control ABA biosynthesis
  and signaling. AAO, ABA-aldehyde oxidase; ABF, ABA responsive element-binding factor;
  LHY, late hypocotyl elongation factor; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase;
  NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; PAP, 3ʹ-phosphoadenosine-5ʹ-phosphate; PP2C, protein
  phosphatase 2C; SAL1, dinucleotide phosphatase/inositol phosphate phosphatase; SDR,
  short chain dehydrogenase; SLAC1, slow anion channel-associated 1; SnRK2s, SNF1-related
  protein kinases; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; XRN, exoribonucleases; ZEP, zeaxanthin
  epoxidase.
