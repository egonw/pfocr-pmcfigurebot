figure_title: KEGG pathway diagram for antigen processing and presentation illustrating
  the central processes involved in antigen processing and presentation, which are
  essential for immune system function
caption: 'The diagram focuses on the breakdown of pathogens into peptide fragments,
  their subsequent association with MHC molecules and their presentation to T cells,
  thereby triggering an immune response (Image source credit: Kanehisa Laboratories).'
