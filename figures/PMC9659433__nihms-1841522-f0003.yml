caption: Effects of QCT on autophagy stimulation in SMMC7721 cells via regulation
  of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathways. (A) The effects of QCT
  on the levels of total and phosphorylated AKT, mTOR, p70S6K and 4EBP1 proteins were
  detected by Western blot. (B, D) Cells pretreated with MK (3 μM) or SC (10 μM) for
  2 h were co-treated with QCT (40 μM) for another 24 h, and the p-AKT and LC3A/B
  protein expression levels were measured by Western blot. (C) Cells transfected with
  AKT siRNA (si-AKT) or control siRNA (si-CON) for 48 h were treated with QCT (40
  μM) for another 24 h, and the levels of p-AKT and LC3A/B proteins were measured
  by Western blot. (E) Cells were treated with QCT at different concentrations for
  24 h, and the total and phosphorylated protein levels of JNK, ERK and p38MAPK were
  detected by Western blot. (F–H) Cells pretreated with SP (10 μM), PD (1 μM) or SB
  (10 μM) for 2 h were co-incubated with QCT (40 μM) for another 24 h, and the levels
  of LC3A/B, p-JNK, p-ERK or p-p38MAPK proteins were detected by Western blot. (I–K)
  Cells were transfected with siRNAs against JNK (si-JNK), ERK (si-ERK) or p38MAPK
  (si-p38MAPK), or their corresponding controls (si-CON) for 48 h and then treated
  with QCT (40 μM) for another 24 h. Levels of LC3A/B and p-JNK or p-ERK or p-p38MAPK
  proteins were measured by Western blot. Independent experiments were repeated three
  times. Densitometry analysis results of the protein levels are presented in .
