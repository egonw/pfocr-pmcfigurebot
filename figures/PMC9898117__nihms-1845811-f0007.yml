figure_title: Human DLBCL tissues show STAT3, c-JUN and TLR4 upregulation in higher
  BMI groups
caption: (A) Human DLBCL sections show increased STAT3, c-JUN, TLR4 and c-MYC staining
  in tumor groups in comparison to images from the non-cancerous group, and unrelated
  cancer (prostate).(B) Quantitation of marker staining from panel B. Data are represented
  as mean ± S.D. * denote statistical significance (P < 0.05).(C) Human DLBCL sections
  stained from STAT3 and c-JUN. The high BMI group showed significantly higher levels
  of STAT3 and c-JUN compared to the lower BMI sample.(D) Human DLBCL sections stained
  for TLR4 and c-MYC. The high BMI sample showed significantly higher staining for
  TLR4 and C-MYC compared to the lower BMI sample.(E) Staining intensity of markers
  shown in  and  was quantified using Image J software. Level of STAT3, c-JUN, TLR4
  and c-Myc were all significantly higher for sections obtained from high BMI patients.
  Data are represented as mean ± S.D. * denote statistical significance (P < 0.05).(F)
  Detection of c-Myc in lymphoma patients with a history of HCV infection, obesity
  or both. (Left) Schematic diagram shows t(8;14) translocation and long-PCR rimer
  sets. Arrows indicate primer binding sites to amplify PCR products to detect t(8;14)
  translocations. (Right) Presence of bands mean that there is potential MYC translocation.(G)
  Chromosomal translocation t(8;14) in patient samples. The percentage of this translocation
  was highest in HCV patients with obesity. PCR amplification of DNA from these patients
  showed the presence of chromosomal translation in less than 10% of HCV-infected
  patients or obese patients. For HCV infected patients with obesity the percentage
  was about 40%. Sample size of all 4 groups (with/without obesity and with/without
  HCV) was analyzed.(H) Schematic illustration of our proposed model where HCFD and
  LPS or HCV upregulate TLR4 resulting in the activation of c-JUN and migration to
  the nucleus where it binds STAT3 resulting in the activation of AID for facilitating
  translocation between c-MYC and Ig loci, thus leading to lymphoproliferation. This
  pathway also inhibits FAS resulting in inhibition of apoptosis and contributing
  to lymphoproliferation.
