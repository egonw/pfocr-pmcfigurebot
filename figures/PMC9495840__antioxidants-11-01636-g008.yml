caption: '(a) Effects of nomilin and arbutin on tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2 expression
  in B16F10 melanoma cells. B16F10 cells were treated with different concentrations
  of nomilin and arbutin prior to α-MSH treatment for 24 h. β-actin was used as a
  loading control antibody. (b) Quantitative analysis of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2
  by Western blotting. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies
  against tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2. (c) Effects of nomilin and arbutin on MITF
  expression in B16F10 cells. B16F10 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of nomilin and arbutin prior to α-MSH treatment for 4 h. (d) Quantitative analysis
  of MITF by Western blotting. (e) Effects of nomilin and arbutin on p-CREB, CREB,
  p-PKA, and PKA levels in B16F10 cells. B16F10 cells were treated with the indicated
  concentrations of nomilin and arbutin prior to α-MSH treatment for 3 h. (f) Quantitative
  analysis of p-CREB, CREB, p-PKA, and PKA by Western blotting. Values are significantly
  different with Duncan’s multiple range test (significant compared with the vehicle-treated
  control, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, bars indicate SD). CREB: cAMP response element
  binding protein, p-CREB: phospho-CREB, α-MSH: α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
  MITF: microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, and PKA: protein kinase A,
  p-PKA: phospho-PKA.'
