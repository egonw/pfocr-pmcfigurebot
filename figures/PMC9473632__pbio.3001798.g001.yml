figure_title: Biomimetic afferent response dynamics are implemented in the vestibular
  prosthesis mapping between head motion and stimulation rate
caption: (A) Schematic of the VOR pathway. Both types of vestibular afferents (regular
  and irregular) convey head movement information to the vestibular nuclei, which,
  in turn, stabilize the gaze via the VOR. (B) Schematic of how the prosthesis converts
  head movements into pulsatile stimulation. The mapping (black box) consists of the
  linear transfer functions, which mimic the response dynamics of regular (blue) and
  irregular (red) afferents or represent the conventional mapping with static gain
  and phase lead (gray), in cascade with the sigmoidal nonlinearity, which limits
  the firing rate to be above zero and below the maximum rate of 500 Hz. (C) Example
  of the stimulation rate, modulated around the baseline rate of 150 pps, in response
  to sinusoidal head movements at 1 Hz. At this frequency, the stimulation rates are
  similar for all mappings. Vertical line denotes the peak of head movement for phase
  comparison. (D) Example of the stimulation rate in response to sinusoidal head movements
  at 10 Hz. Both regular and irregular mappings display greater depth of modulation
  in firing and bigger phase lead than the static mapping, which remains in-phase
  and shows the same depth of modulation as in (C).
