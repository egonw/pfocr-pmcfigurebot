caption: WGCNA co-expression analysis identifies stroke-related genes. (A) Clustering
  dendrogram and trait heatmap of control and stroke peripheral blood samples from
  transcriptomic sequencing dataset GSE22255. (B) Scale-free fit index (left) and
  mean connectivity (right) for various soft-thresholding powers β, with the red line
  indicating a correlation coefficient of 0.9. (C) Clustering dendrogram of co-expressed
  genes, with each leaf corresponding to a different gene module. (D) Heatmap of module-trait
  correlations in dataset GSE22255, with each cell containing the corresponding correlation
  and p-value. (E) Barplot of module gene importance scores. (F) Scatterplot of correlation
  between pink module genes and gene importance. Con (n = 20) represents the control
  group samples, and IS (n = 20) represents the stroke group samples.
