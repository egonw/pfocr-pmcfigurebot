caption: STAT3 interacts with JMJD3 and RORγt in Th17 cells. The associations of JMJD3
  and STAT3, STAT3 and RORγt were enhanced after Pg-LPS stimulation. Total protein
  extracts were prepared from primary CD4+ T cells cultured for 5 days under Th17-polarizing
  conditions untreated or stimulated with Pg-LPS and then subjected to IP with anti-STAT3
  antibody. The immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western
  blot using indicated antibodies. Five percent of the total protein extracts were
  loaded as positive control (Input). Meanwhile, total protein extracts were immunoprecipitated
  with an antibody against rabbit IgG isotype as negative control (IgG). IP, immunoprecipitation;
  RORγt, retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor γt; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis.
