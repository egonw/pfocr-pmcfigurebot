figure_title: BMP-2/SMAD pathway was impaired in CTR9 KD hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation
caption: (A) Schematic workflow for preparation of shControl and shCTR9 hMSCs to RNA-seq.
  (B) Volcano plots of RNA-seq data showing the up- or down-regulated genes in shCTR9
  hMSCs in compared to shControl hMSCs after 7 days of osteogenic induction. Blue
  dots indicated the significantly down-regulated genes. Red dots indicated the significant
  upregulated genes (n = 3). (C) Reactome pathway analysis of significant down-regulated
  genes in shCTR9 hMSCs. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis analysis of significant
  down-regulated genes on BMP signaling pathway. FDR, false discovery rate. (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining of BMP-2 (Red) along with the ER marker calnexin (green) and cell/nuclear
  membrane dye (DiD; cyan) in shControl or shCTR9 hMSCs from days 0 to 14 of osteogenic
  induction. Scale bar, 60× (at the bottom right applied to all images with merged
  colors). (F) WB of BMP-2 in different cellular fractions derived from shControl
  or shCTR9 hMSCs after 0 to 14 days of osteogenic induction. Histone H3, GAPDH, and
  Na+,K+-ATPase (Na+- and K+-dependent ATPase) served as loading controls for corresponding
  cellular fractions. (G) Representative images showing the ALP activity–associated
  BCIP-NBT staining (left) and Alizarin Red S staining of ECM formation (right) in
  shControl or shCTR9 hMSCs with or without the supplement of BMP-2 peptide after
  indicated days of osteogenic induction. Scale bar, 20× (at the bottom right applied
  to all images).
