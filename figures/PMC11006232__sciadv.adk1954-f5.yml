figure_title: EhV-201 structure and replication
caption: '(A) 3D representation of cryo-tomogram of an EhV-201â€“infected cell. The
  cell envelope is shown in green, cellular membranes in white, the content of intracellular
  vesicles in semi-transparent blue, assembly intermediates in yellow, full particles
  in red, and virions in purple. Scale bar, 500 nm. (B) EhV-201 virion structure.
  The genome is shown in gray, the inner membrane in blue, the capsid in magenta,
  penton proteins in purple, the outer membrane in light orange, central vertex proteins
  in red, peripheral vertex proteins in light blue, the ridge proteins in yellow,
  and fibers in black. (C) Infection cycle of EhV-201. Abortive infection: (i) Surface
  membrane (SM) and cell envelope (CE) with underlying cytoplasmic leaflets (CL) protect
  E. huxleyi from EhV-201 infection; the viral genome is delivered into the extra-cytoplasmic
  space. Productive infection: (ii) EhV-201 virion fuses its inner membrane with plasma
  membrane to deliver its genome into the cytoplasm. (iii) Empty particle remains
  attached to the cell surface. (iv) EhV-201 genome replicates in the cell nucleus
  (N). (v) Segmentation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and outer nuclear membrane.
  (vi) Genome packaging and capsid assembly initiate on opposite surfaces of membrane
  segments. (vii) Genome is packaged into a particle through an aperture. (viii) The
  completion of the genome packaging induces a conformational change in the capsid,
  which enables it to bud into intracellular vesicles (IV). (ix) Virion inside an
  intracellular vesicle. (x) EhV-201 infection causes the loss of surface protective
  layers from E. huxleyi cells, which enables the continuous release of virions by
  exocytosis. (xi) The EhV-201 replication cycle is terminated by cell lysis, which
  results in the release of virions inside vesicles. Alternative infection pathway:
  (xii) Phagocytosis of EhV-201 virions inside vesicles. Ch, chloroplast; M, mitochondrion;
  GA, Golgi apparatus. Panels (B) and (C) were created using BioRender.com.'
