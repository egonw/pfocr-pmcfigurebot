caption: Expression of photosynthesis‐related genes in response to soybean mosaic
  virus (SMV) infection. (a) Heat‐map of photosynthesis‐related genes regulated by
  infection with the avirulent strain G5H or the virulent strain G7H of SMV. Expression
  of ATPsyn‐α (b) and PSaC (c) in L29 plants (which carry the Rsv3 resistance gene)
  at 8, 24, and 54 h postinfection (hpi) by G7H::eGFP. Expression of ATPsyn‐α (d)
  and PSaC (e) in Lee74 plants (rsv‐null) at 8, 24, and 54 hpi by G7H::eGFP. Actin11
  was used as the internal control. In (b–e), values are means + SD of three biological
  replicates. Values were compared to that of the corresponding mock‐treated plants
  (the bar on the left) with one‐sided Student's t tests; * and ** indicate a significant
  difference at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively
