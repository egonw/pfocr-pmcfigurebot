caption: The top 20â€‰MF terms associated with the main targets of coix seed active
  components. The y-axis shows significantly enriched molecular function terms of
  the target genes, and the x-axis shows the Rich factor (P < 0.05). Rich factor represents
  the ratio of the number of target genes in a specific molecular function term to
  the number of all annotated genes located in that molecular function term. A higher
  rich factor indicates a higher enrichment level. The size of the dot indicates the
  number of target genes in the pathway, and the color of the dot represents the different
  FDR ranges.
