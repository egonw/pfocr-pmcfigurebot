caption: SMARCD3-OT1 regulates the CDKN1A pathway and MYOD pathway in vivo. (a) Relative
  SMARCD3-OT1 expression in gastrocnemius muscle after infection with SMARCD3-OT1-expressing
  lentivirus (LV-SMARCD3-OT1) or negative control (LV-NC) (n = 6). (b) Relative SMARCD3-OT1
  expression in gastrocnemius muscle after infection with modified ASO specific to
  SMARCD3-OT1 (ASO-SMARCD3-OT1) or negative control (NC) (n = 6). (c,d) Relative mRNA
  levels of several cell cycle genes after overexpression or knockdown of SMARCD3-OT1
  in vivo (n = 6). (e,f) Relative mRNA levels of several myogenesis marker genes after
  overexpression or knockdown of SMARCD3-OT1 in vivo (n = 6). (g,h) Relative protein
  levels of several myogenesis marker genes after overexpression or knockdown of SMARCD3-OT1
  in vivo (n = 3). The numbers shown below the bands are folds of band intensities
  relative to control. Band intensities were quantified by ImageJ and normalized to
  GAPDH. Data are expressed as a fold change relative to the control. Results are
  shown as mean Â± SEM. Statistical significances of differences between means were
  assessed using a paired sample t test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
