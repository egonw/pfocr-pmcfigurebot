figure_title: Propionate suppresses the cell growth of HCT116 and LS174T cells via
  cell apoptosis
caption: A, B Cell growth assay after sodium propionate treatment for 48 h. HCT116
  and LS174T cells were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with crystal violet solution.
  Scale bar, 200 μm (A). Cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C after adding CCK-8
  solution. The intensity of cell growth was measured using a microplate reader (450 nm).
  Mean ± SD of three independent experiments. p values were calculated using Student’s
  t-test (***p < 0.001) (B). C Western blot analysis after sodium propionate treatment
  using anti-PARP. ACTB was used as the internal control in HCT116 and LS174T cells.
  The signal intensities were quantified using ImageJ software. D FACS analysis using
  Muse Caspase 3/7 working solution was performed after sodium propionate treatment.
  The upper right panel indicates the apoptotic and dead cell proportions (left).
  Quantification of caspase 3/7 activity. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  p values were calculated using Student’s t-test (***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01) (right).
  E FACS analysis of Annexin V staining was performed after sodium propionate treatment.
  The lower right and upper right quadrants indicate early apoptosis and late apoptosis
  (left). Quantification of apoptosis. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  p values were calculated using Student’s t-test (***p < 0.001) (right). F DAVID-based
  GO analysis of RNA-seq results of the up- and downregulated genes among the 872
  genes. G DAVID-based KEGG pathway analysis of 872 genes. The enriched terms are
  shown. H GSEA using 872 genes. I Representative images of the morphology of hIOs
  after treatment with varying concentrations of propionate. Scale bar, 500 μm. J
  Cell viability assessed by the CCK assay in hIO treated with the indicated concentrations
  of propionate. n = 3 per group. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments. p values
  were calculated using Student’s t-test (n.s. nonsignificant).
