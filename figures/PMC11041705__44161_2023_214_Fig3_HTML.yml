  DCM
caption: a, Reporter metabolite analysis using differentially expressed genes in ventricles
  of Kdm8fl/fl control and Kdm8fl/fl;Myh6-Cre mutant mice at 2 and 6 months of age.
  The left panel illustrates all 46 reporter metabolites detected in 2-month-old hearts.
  The right panel illustrates the top 55 out of 718 reporter metabolites. Upregulated
  metabolites are in red, and downregulated metabolites are in blue. Data were analyzed
  by piano using distinct-directional P values. n = 2 mice per group at 2 months,
  and 3 mice per group at 6 months. b, Metabolomic networks from liquid chromatography–mass
  spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis of ventricles of control and mutant hearts at 2 and
  6 months of age. Significantly altered metabolites are circled in black. Upregulated
  metabolites are in red, and downregulated metabolites are in blue. Each time point
  was independently analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test. P values were adjusted
  for false discovery by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. n = 5 controls and 7 mutants
  at 2 months; n = 9 controls and 5 mutants at 6 months. c, Quantification of NAM,
  NAD+ and 1-methyl-NAM by LC–MS, and ATP by fluorometric assay. Data are mean ± s.d.
  Each time point was analyzed by an independent two-tailed Student’s t-test, and
  two-way ANOVA with genotype, time point, and genotype–time point interaction as
  main effects. P values were adjusted for FDR by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. n = 5
  controls and 7 mutants at 2 months; n = 9 controls and 5 mutants at 6 months for
  LC–MS. n = 3 hearts per group for ATP fluorometric assay. d, Heatmap of qPCR of
  genes encoding enzymes in the NAD+pathway in 2-month-old ventricles. n = 4 hearts
  per group for the top 15 genes. n = 5 for Nmrk1 and Nmrk2. Significantly downregulated
  genes are in purple, and significantly upregulated genes are in yellow. e, Western
  blot of Nampt in 6-month-old ventricles. n = 5 hearts per group. The experiment
  was repeated twice with similar results. f, NAD+biosynthetic pathways highlighting
  significantly downregulated and upregulated genes in Kdm8 mutant hearts. NAM, nicotinamide;
  NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NR, nicotinamide riboside; MeNAM, methylnicotinamide;
  NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Me4PY, N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide.
