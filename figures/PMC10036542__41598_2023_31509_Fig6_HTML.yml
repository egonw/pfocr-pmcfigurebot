caption: Operon prediction and analysis. (A) Six operon clusters were identified with
  k-means clustering method. Black colored line is the average of the operon values
  that belonging to the cluster at the each time points. (B,C) Pathway enrichment
  analysis of genes in operon cluster 1 and 2. Red colored bar is most enriched term
  in cluster1 and orange colored bar is most enriched term in cluster2. The red dotted
  line indicates statistical significance of p-value.
