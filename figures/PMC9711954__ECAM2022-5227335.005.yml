caption: Isoschaftoside inhibits the activation of ERK1/2/mTOR pathway in microglia.
  (a–c) Expression of ERK1/2 and mTOR after 9 h of treatment with lipopolysaccharide
  (10 ng/mL) and isoschaftoside (200 μM). (d–f) And when the cells were treated with
  CoCl2, isoschaftoside also inhibited the activation of ERK1/2/mTOR pathway in microglia.
  Data are means ± SD; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 for comparisons shown,
  n = 3. Statistical analyses were done by using two-way ANOVA with the Tukey's post
  hoc test.
