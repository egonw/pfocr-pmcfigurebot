caption: 'MiR-20a promoted FSS-induced osteogenic differentiation. To investigate
  the effects of miR-20a on FSS-induced osteogenic differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells
  were transfected with 50 nM NC, miR-20a mimics, or 100 nM anti-miR-20a and treated
  with 12 dyn/cm2 FSS for 1 h. (A) ALP activity was detected in miR-20a-overexpressed
  cells on day 3. (B) ALP activity in miR-20a-inhibited cells on day 3. (C) Nodule
  formation was measured by Alizarin Red S staining pf. Relative means and standard
  deviations were shown underneath (scale bar: 50 µm). Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD for n=3; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. FSS, fluid shear stress; pf., post-FSS treatment;
  ALP, alkaline phosphatase; C, transfection reagent only group; NC, miRNA negative
  control group; NC + F, negative control plus fluid shear stress group; miR-20a +
  F, miR-20a mimics plus fluid shear stress group; inhibitor-NC, inhibitor negative
  control group; anti-miR-20a + F, anti-miR-20a mimics plus fluid shear stress group.'
