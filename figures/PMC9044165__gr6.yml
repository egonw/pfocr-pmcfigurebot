caption: 'Integration of the trans-omic network of insulin action with a CRISPR screen

  .(B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the insulin-responsive and insulin non-responsive
  screen hits. See also .(C) Distribution of Spearman correlation coefficients of
  the pairs within hit-IRGs, between hit-IRGs and non-hit IRGs, and within non-hit
  IRGs. To test co-regulation of IRGs within the above categories, we examined whether
  the average Spearman correlation coefficients of the IRG pairs in each of the categories
  were significantly higher than randomly sampled IRG pairs. We also compared the
  distribution of Spearman correlation between the categories by the Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. See also  and .(D) Time course of the
  hit-IRGs in significantly co-regulated KEGG pathways. Data are shown as the log2
  fold change values compared to time 0 that are calculated from the mean of biological
  replicates. Different line colors indicate different hit-IRGs. We tested the significance
  of the average Spearman correlation in each group as described in the . We analyzed
  KEGG pathways containing 10 or more hit-IRGs. See also .(E) We predicted subnetworks
  required for cell growth in an insulin-dependent manner in the following two steps
  (Step VII-I and VII-II). In Step VII-I, we extracted TF-centric subnetworks each
  containing a TF, its upstream signaling pathways, and its target IRGs from the trans-omic
  network of insulin action. We mapped the Z-score obtained from the CRISPR KO screen
  to the extracted subnetworks. In Step VII-II, we selected subnetworks required for
  cell growth by the following three criteria: (i) the results of Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) () is significant for upstream signaling molecules of a TF (FDR
  <0.05); (ii) the result of GSEA is significant for the target IRG for the TF (FDR
  <0.05); and (iii) the TF itself is a screen hit.(F) The scatterplot shows the Z-score
  of the CRISPR screen for each of the screened genes. A smaller Z-score indicates
  a lower cell proliferation activity. Genes are sorted by the Z-score. The barcode
  plots below the scatterplot show the distribution of the upstream signaling molecules
  (“Sig.”) of the TFs (E), and the target IRGs (“IRGs”) regulated by the TFs (B).
  Bar graphs indicate the normalized enrichment score (NES) of GSEA and the color
  of a bar indicates the significance of the NES (FDR< 0.05). Labels of TFs included
  in subnetworks involved in cell growth defined in E are shown in red.(G) The predicted
  subnetwork required for cell growth consists of a TF Myc, its upstream signaling
  molecules (insulin signal; E), and its target hit-IRGs (IRGs; B and A). The TF layer
  contains the Myc TF that is required for cell growth as shown in red in F. The pathway
  layer contains KEGG pathways that contain three or more members that overlap with
  the hit-IRGs regulated by Myc. Pathways containing two or fewer members that overlap
  with the hit-IRGs regulated by Myc were categorized as “Other functions.” See also
