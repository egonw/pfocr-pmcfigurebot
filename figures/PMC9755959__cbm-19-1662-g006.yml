caption: MiR-378a-3p inhibits GLI1/2 and GC stemness. (A, B) Tumorsphere formation
  assays of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) transfected with miR-378a-3p mimics
  or inhibitor and the corresponding NC. The number of tumorspheres >50 μm per field
  was counted and statistically analyzed. (C, D) Expression of CD44 after miR-378a-3p
  treatment in GCSCs, detected by flow cytometry. (E-G) Correlations between GLI1
  and RAB31, GLI2 and RAB31, and GLI1 and GLI2, analyzed on the basis of TCGA database.
  (H) Expression of GLI1, GLI2, Cyclin D1, and stemness-associated proteins after
  miR-378a-3p treatment in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells (scale bar = 100 μm, **P < 0.01).
article_title: MiR-378a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer via directly
  targeting RAB31 and inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway proteins GLI1/2.
