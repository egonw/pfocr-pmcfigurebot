caption: Cucurbitacin B down-regulated TNF-α-induced cell-surface ICAM-1 expression.
  (A) Structure of cucurbitacin B. (B,C) A549 cells were pretreated with serial dilutions
  of cucurbitacin B for 1 h and were then treated with (blue circles in (B) and red
  circles in (C)) or without (gray circles) TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) in the presence of cucurbitacin
  B at the indicated final concentrations for 6 h. Cell viability (%) (B) and ICAM-1
  protein (%) (C) are shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. (D,E)
  A549 cells were incubated with cucurbitacin B for 1 h and then treated with or without
  TNF-α (2.5 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of cucurbitacin B (30 µM) for 6 h.
  Histograms are representative of three independent experiments (D). Cell-surface
  ICAM-1 (%) is shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments (E). * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
