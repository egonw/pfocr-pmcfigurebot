caption: 'The distribution analysis of CyclinD1 and CCND1 negative and positive cases
  with respect to the inflammasome proteins in the different molecular groups. (A)
  NLRP3 expression in CyclinD1 positive and negative cases. (B) NLRP3 expression in
  CCND1 positive and negative cases. (C) PYCARD expression in CyclinD1 positive and
  negative cases. (D) NLRP3 expression in CCND1 positive and negative cases. IRS:
  Immuno Reactive Score. The IRS was calculated by the product of the Proportional
  Score (PS) obtained from the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of the
  staining (see the materials and methods section). Values are expressed as a median
  (horizontal bold line in each box), dot indicates outliers. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.'
