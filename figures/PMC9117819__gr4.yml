caption: 'Macrophage SCAP expression is abnormally increased in eWAT and liver tissues
  of PD-fed mice. (A) Immunofluorescence staining of SCAP and F4/80 in eWAT and liver
  tissues (n = 3). (B) Flow cytometry was used to analyze expression of SCAP in F4/80+CD11c+
  macrophages of eWAT (n = 3). (C) Flow cytometry was used to analyze expression of
  SCAP in F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages of liver tissues (n = 3). (D) Mice with macrophage/monocyte-specific
  deletion of SCAP (SCAPΔMϕ mice) were generated by crossing SCAPfl/fl mice with LysM
  Cre mice. (E) Genotyping SCAP knockout mice by PCR showed different genotypes: SCAP+/+,
  SCAP+/−, SCAP−/−. (F) Relative mRNA levels of SCAP in bone marrow-derived macrophage
  cells. (G) Schematic outline of experimental approaches and analyses. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .0001; ns, nonsignificant (2-tailed unpaired
  t test in bar graphs).'
