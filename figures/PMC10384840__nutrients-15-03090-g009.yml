caption: A proposed mechanism of necroptosis activation through the synergistic combination
  of quercetin or kaempferol with Smac mimetic LCL-161. Quercetin and kaempferol are
  extensively studied flavonoids with potential anticancer properties. Through network
  pharmacology, both quercetin and kaempferol have shown the potential to interact
  with multiple targets, including DNA topoisomerase II and G2/M cell-cycle hallmark
  genes. This interaction can result in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of cell
  proliferation. In parallel, Smac mimetic LCL-161 degrades cIAP1 and cIAP2, activating
  a non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway that generates pro-death signals, potentially
  including autocrine TNF-α. In the context of slow proliferation of CCA cells induced
  by quercetin or kaempferol, the accumulation of pro-death signals generated by Smac
  mimetic LCL-161 triggers necroptosis in the absence of cIAP1/2 and caspase activity.
  Necroptosis is initiated in the CCA cells expressing key components of necroptosis,
  including RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. This process ultimately culminates in the release
  of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This figure was created with BioRender.com
