figure_title: Acetylcholine and serotonin signaling pathways are altered in the enteric
  neurons of chd8 sa19827/+ larvae
caption: '(A) Heatmap shows gene expression for the 279 differentially expressed genes:
  93 down-regulated genes and 186 up-regulated genes in chd8 sa19827/+. Values have
  been centered and scaled for each row. Each row represents a single gene. The full
  list of genes, P-values, and associated annotations is provided in Supplemental
  Data 1. (B, C) Protein–protein interaction network of the differentially expressed
  genes in chd8 sa19827/+. Nodes with no interactions with other proteins of the protein–protein
  interaction network are not shown. Line thickness indicates the strength of data
  support. The full network is shown in . (B) Cluster of 14 proteins including four
  proteins of the serotonin signaling pathway: htr1bd, htr3a, htr6, and tph2. (C)
  Cluster of four proteins including three proteins involved in the acetylcholine
  signaling pathway: chrna1, chrna2b, and chrna6. (D) Serotonergic synapse adapted
  from KEGG pathways. Genes boxed in blue denote down-regulated genes, and genes boxed
  in red denote up-regulated genes. (E) Representative lateral images of the intestine
  of chd8+/+ and chd8 sa19827/+ zebrafish larvae at 5 days post-fertilization stained
  with anti-HuC/D and anti-5-HT monoclonal antibodies to visualize the enteric post-mitotic
  neurons and the enteric serotonergic cells, respectively. White arrowheads show
  serotonergic neurons (HuC/D- and 5-HT–positive cells). (F) Dot plot of the number
  of 5-HT–positive cells for each condition tested. A t test was conducted between
  pairs of conditions. (G) Dot plot of the number of HuC/D-positive cells for each
  condition tested. A Mann–Whitney test was conducted between pairs of conditions.
  (H) Dot plot showing the percentage of serotonergic neurons, for each condition
  tested. A Mann–Whitney test was conducted between pairs of conditions. (I) Dot plot
  of the number of HuC/D-negative/5-HT–positive cells for each condition tested. A
  Mann–Whitney test was conducted between pairs of conditions. n, number of larvae.'
