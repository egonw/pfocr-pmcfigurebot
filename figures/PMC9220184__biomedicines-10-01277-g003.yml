caption: 'Blocking DNA-PK and ATR activity retards DNA repair of radiation-induced
  DNA damage in squamous bladder cancer cells. (A) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of stained nuclear tails are shown for each time point and treatment option
  (i.e., single DNA-PK and ATR inhibitor treatment (both: 10 µM), combined treatment
  application of DNA-PK and ATR inhibitors, and non-treated cells (controls)). A neutral
  comet assay was performed and images were obtained with 20× original magnification.
  (B) Semi-quantitative analyses of the tail moment of SCaBER cells upon combined
  irradiation (8 Gy) and DNA-PK/ATR DDR pathway inhibition illustrating a retarded
  DNA repair response. Overall n = 5493 individual cells (35–148 cells/sample) with
  corresponding tails were analyzed by ImageJ. The time point 0 h was used for normalization.
  The calculation of the tail moment of non-irradiated cells but upon DNA-PK/ATR treatment
  was considered as a control to exclude drug-induced DNA damage. Curves of tail moments
  represent means from at least n = 2 independent experiments (except for dotted control
  lines). (C) Western blots were performed to assess the cleavage of PARP1 as an apoptotic
  marker with and without irradiation (dose = 8 Gy) as well as upon single and dual
  DNA-PK/ATR inhibition in SCaBER bladder cancer cells. GAPDH was used as a loading
  control.'
