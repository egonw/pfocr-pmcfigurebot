figure_title: C11orf54 knockdown suppresses HIF1A and glycolysis signaling pathway
caption: 'a Volcano plot showing the significantly changed genes in C11orf54 knockdown
  versus control sample (red dot: upregulated genes, blue dot: downregulated genes,
  gray dot: no significant changed genes). b The top 20 functionally enriched KEGG
  pathways found in the analysis of DEGs in C11orf54 knockdown versus control sample.
  c Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) show hypoxia and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis
  signaling pathway has a trend to enrich the C11orf54 knockdown group. d qPCR experiment
  analysis of the mRNA expression of the glycolysis genes in C11orf54 knockdown and
  control cells (n = 4 biological replicates, data are presented as mean values ± SD,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). e, f Western blots (e) and quantitative results
  (f) of the glycolysis proteins in C11orf54 knockdown and control cells (n = 4 biological
  replicates; data are presented as mean values ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).'
