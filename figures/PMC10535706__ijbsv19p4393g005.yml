caption: 'AhR activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CRC Cells. (A) Immunofluorescence
  micrographs of AhR (green) and β-catenin (red) expression in the colon tissues of
  ApcMin/+ AhR -/- and ApcMin/+ mice. Scale bar: 100 μM. (B) Immunohistochemical staining
  with an antibody against c-Myc and cyclinD1 in ApcMin/+ AhR -/- and ApcMin/+ mice.
  Scale bar: 100μM. (C) Western blotting showing expression levels of β-catenin, LEF1,
  and TCF4 in AhR KO, AhR sh-RNA, and WT in DLD-1 and NCM460 cells as described in
  Materials. (D) Western blotting showing expression levels of β-catenin, LEF1, and
  TCF4 in DLD-1 and NCM460 cells co-treated with ITE (10.0 μM, 24h), or AhR KO cells.
  Data from triplicate experiments are presented as mean ± SD, with Welch''s correction
  through one-tailed t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
