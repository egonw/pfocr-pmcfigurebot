caption: Wnt pathway inhibitors were added to detect the effect of Wnt/Ca2+signaling
  pathway expression on NSCLC tissues. (a) The expression of the downstream gene LEF1/TCF1
  was detected by qPCR to determine the inhibition efficiency. (b) The expression
  of Wnt pathway protein was detected by WB. (c) CCK8 was used to detect cell proliferation.
  (d) Transwell tested the invasion ability of cells. Compared to the control group,
  âˆ—P < 0.05, the difference was statistically significant.
