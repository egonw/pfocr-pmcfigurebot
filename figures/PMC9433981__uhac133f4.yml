caption: Expression pattern of VviAGL11 and the top 100 VviAGL11 co-expressed genes
  in the entire ovule and developing seed transcriptome. The heat map and hierarchical
  clustering (HCL) analysis were performed by using TMeV software (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mev-tm4/).
  Functional categories of investigated genes are reported according to the legend.
  “Others” category includes those categories with a maximum of two genes (i.e Cellular
  homeostasis, Coenzyme, and prosthetic group metabolism, Cytoskeleton organization
  and biogenesis, Organelle organization and biogenesis, Oxidation–reduction, Terpenoid
  metabolism, Signaling pathway). VviAGL11 and its candidate target genes (VviMJE,
  VviGT3, and VviIFR) are reported in bold.
article_title: VviAGL11 self-regulates and targets hormone- and secondary metabolism-related
  genes during seed development.
