figure_title: EGFR inhibition promoted ferroptotic sensitivity via enhancing autophagy
caption: A TEM results showed ultrastructural features of autophagy in MDA-MB-231
  cells when treated with erastin and/or lapatinib; scale bars represent 2 μm. B LC3B
  and Atg7 visualized by CLSM in MDA-MB-231 cells when treated with erastin and/or
  lapatinib, scale bars represent 50 μm. C Western blot analysis for LC3B, Atg7 and
  P62 in MDA-MB-231 cells when treated with erastin and/or lapatinib. D CLSM images
  of ferritin and LC3B in MDA-MB-231 cells when treated with erastin and lapatinib,
  scale bars represent 10 μm. E GSEA of YAP signaling pathway in EGFR-blockade cells.
  F, G p-mTOR and YAP expression in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with sh-EGFR or EGFR-OE.
  H LC3 and Atg7 in MDA-MB-231 cells visualized by CLSM, scale bars represent 50 μm.
  I Western blot analysis for LC3B, Atg7 and FTH1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. J Intracellular
  ferrous iron in MDA-MB-231 cells. K ROS generation in MDA-MB-231 cells, scale bars
  represent 100 μm. **P < 0.01.
