caption: 'DEGs involved in gibberellin, cytokinin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid signaling
  pathways. (A–D) Gibberellin, cytokinin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid signal transduction
  pathways by referring to the KO04075 pathway in KEGG enrichment analysis. (E) Heatmaps
  showing the relative expression of DEGs involved in the above-mentioned hormone
  signaling pathways. The purple boxes indicate the genes in which expression was
  significantly changed by 9 w vs. 13 w. 9 w: vegetative stage, 13 w: shifts to reproductive
  stage at gene level, 15 w: reproductive stage. The column with the black boxes represents
  the student’s t test analysis of DEGs by 9 w vs. 13 w; The column with the pink
  boxes represents the student’s t test analysis of DEGs by 13 w vs. 15 w; The column
  with the blue boxes represents the student’s t test analysis of DEGs by 9 w vs.
  15 w. (* |Log2FC| ≥ 1, p < 0.05. ** |Log2FC| ≥ 2, p < 0.01).'
