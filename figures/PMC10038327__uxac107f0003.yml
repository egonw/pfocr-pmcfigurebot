caption: 'Bioenergetics in RA T cells. Mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial content,
  and mitochondrial metabolic intermediates are critical determinants of T-cell fate
  and functional commitment. The synovial tissue is low in oxygen and low in glucose
  but has availability of lactate and glutamine. The metabolic profile of T cells
  that survive in this environment have the following characteristics: downregulation
  of glycolytic flux, shunting of glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway, low ATP
  production, and reversal of the TCA cycle. This metabolic profile identifies a short-lived
  effector T cell. RA T cells hyperproduce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β/IL-18
  via caspase activation and undergo lytic cell death. Due to the mis-trafficking
  of AMPK away from the lysosomal surface, mTORC1 is stably activated and enforces
  commitment of effector T cells to the pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 lineages. Insufficient
  production of aspartate dysregulates regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD), imposing ER stress and expansion. This process expands ER membranes, enhances
  biogenesis of TNF and turns RA T cells into TNF “superproducers”. Expansion of the
  cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool promotes lipogenesis, which sustains the generation of
  invasive membrane ruffles and of cellular uropods, enabling RA T cells to invade
  into peripheral tissue sites'
