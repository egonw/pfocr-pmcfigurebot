caption: CircNDRG1 regulated smad7 expression and inhibited metastasis by targeting
  miR-520h. (A and B) Transwell and wound-healing assay demonstrated nitroxoline could
  inhibit the migration of bladder cancer cells, circNDRG1-si further promoted the
  migration, which was significantly rescued by preventing the expression of miR-520h.
  (C) Western-blotting assay showed that alteration of the expression levels of smad7,
  smad2/3 and the EMT-associated markers E-cadherin and N-cadherin, caused by nitroxoline
  plus circNDRG1-si treatment, were rescued by transfection with the miR-520h inhibitor.
