caption: Hepatic metabolomics analysis. Differential metabolites in liver tissues
  between the HS and NS groups (a), or the HS and HSCUR groups (b); metabolic pathway
  enrichment analysis based on differential metabolites between the NS and HS groups
  (c), or the HS and HSCUR groups (d). The difference in the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon
  test with the false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method adjusted
  p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Colors in sub-figures (c,d) were
  determined by –log10 (p) values, pathways with higher –log10 (p) were shown in red,
  and vice were shown in yellow.
