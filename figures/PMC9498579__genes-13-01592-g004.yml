caption: 'Genes involved in anthraquinone biosynthesis. (A) Simplified representation
  of biosynthetic pathway and expression pattern of unigenes involved in the biosynthesis
  of anthraquinones. The expression values for each enzyme gene are indicated in color
  on the log10(FPKM + 1) scale for 3 tissues: roots, stems, and leaves. DAHPS: 3-Deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate
  synthase; EPSPs: 3-Phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase; DHQS: 3-Dehydroquinate
  synthase; DHQD/SDH: 3-Dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase; SK: Shikimate
  kinase; CS: Chorismate synthase; MenE: o-Succinylbenzoate-CoA ligase; ICS: Isochorismate
  synthase; MenC: o-Succinylbenzoate synthase; MenB: 1,4-Dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA
  synthase; DXS: 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; HDR: 4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl
  diphosphate reductase; DXR: 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; CMS:
  2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; CMK: 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  kinase; HDS: (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase; IDI: Isopentenyl-diphosphate
  Delta-isomerase; HMGR: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. (B–D) The volcano plots
  of DEGs in each comparison group are marked with enzyme genes related to the anthraquinone
  biosynthesis pathway. (B) Ro_R vs. Ro_L; (C) Ro_R vs. Ro_S; (D) Ro_S vs. Ro_L.'
