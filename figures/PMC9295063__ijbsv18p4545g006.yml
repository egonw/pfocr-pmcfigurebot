caption: 'TGR5 signaling regulates intracellular glutathione metabolism in DCs. TGR5+/+
  and TGR5-/- BMDCs were treated with LCA. A. The top 10 significantly enriched GO
  terms: molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC) and biological process (BP)
  are presented. The x-axis shows the categories of GO terms and y-axis shows the
  Gene number. B. The top 10 up-regulated pathway enrichment analyses from the KEGG
  database. C. The top 10 down-regulated pathway enrichment analyses from the KEGG
  database. D. Heatmap of DEGs associated with Glutathione metabolism. E. Heatmap
  of DEGs associated with HIF-1 pathway.'
