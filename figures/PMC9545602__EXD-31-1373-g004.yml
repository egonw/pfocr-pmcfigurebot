caption: 'Regulation of keratinocyte‐induced chemotaxis of immune cells by upstream
  inflammatory and EGFR signalling. Regulators predicted to be upstream of keratinocyte‐enriched
  lesional skin differently expressed genes (KELS DEGs) were identified using ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA). The KELS DEGs responsible for chemotaxis and known to be
  downstream of these regulators were then analysed using IPA, with the predicted
  promotion or chemotaxis of individual immune cell types given by the activity z‐score.
  Cell types and upstream regulators were clustered using Euclidean distance and complete
  linkage. Cluster 1: Post‐dupilumab treated lesional versus non‐lesional skin, KELS;
  Cluster 2: Post‐dupilumab treatment versus pre‐treatment lesional skin. White coloration
  represents zero significant change'
