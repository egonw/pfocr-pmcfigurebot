caption: GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. (A,B) Biological processes,
  cellular components, and molecular functions were involved in the biological functions
  of GCTB stromal cells with Siglec-15 knockdown in GO enrichment analysis. (C) Twenty
  signaling pathways linked to cancer were shown by KEGG pathway analysis.
