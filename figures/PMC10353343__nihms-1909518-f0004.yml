figure_title: Gene expression changes for genes in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  Signaling Pathway
caption: The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway was adapted using previously published
  sources (, ). Gene expression changes for DCVC+LPS vs. LPS-only treatments are shown
  for genes in the pathway. Most of the genes in the pathway were downregulated in
  DCVC+LPS co-treatments compared to LPS-only treatments.
