caption: '(A-C) Representative z-projections of brain lobes of the indicated genotypes
  labeled with anti-Dcp-1. (D) Quantification of the mean number of Dcp-1 puncta per
  brain lobe normalized to brain lobe volume: Control (Ctxglia-split>OR) (n = 44):
  3.05x10-4, Ctxglia-split>dSARM RNAi #105369 (n = 18): 5.98x10-4, and Ctxglia-split>Ask1
  RNAi #35331 (n = 42): 4.62x10-4. (E-G) Representative 3 mm z-projections of larval
  brains of indicated genotypes labeled with anti-mCherry. (H-J) Representative 3
  mm z-projections of larval brains of indicated genotypes labeled with anti-Drpr.
  (K-M) Representative 3 mm z-projections of larval brains of indicated genotypes
  labeled with anti-Drpr represented as a heatmap. (N) Quantification of mean Drpr
  intensity normalized to Control (Ctxglia-split>mCD8::mCherry, LacZ): 1.00, Ctxglia-split>mCD8::mCherry,
  Ask1 RNAi #35331: 0.86, and Ctxglia-split>mCD8::mCherry, dSARM RNAi #105369: 0.75.
  (O-S) Representative z-projections of brain lobes of the indicated genotypes labeled
  with anti-Dcp-1. (T) Quantification of the mean number of Dcp-1 puncta per brain
  lobe normalized to brain lobe volume: Control (Oregon R): 1.28x10-4, Ask1Δ6: 2.42x10-4,
  dSARM KO: 2.81x10-4, and Ask1Δ6, dSARM KO: 2.78x10-4, and Ctxglia-split>Drpr-1;
  Ask1Δ6: 1.45x10-4. (U,V) Representative 3 mm z-projections of larval brains of indicated
  genotypes labeled with anti-Drpr. (W,X) Representative 3 mm z-projections of larval
  brains of indicated genotypes labeled with anti-Drpr represented as a heatmap. (Y)
  Quantification of mean Drpr intensity normalized to control: Control (Oregon R):
  1.00 and Ask1Δ6: 0.70. (Z) Quantification of the mean number of Dcp-1 puncta per
  brain lobe normalized to brain lobe volume: Ctxglia-split>Control (Oregon R): 2.99x10-4,
  Ctxglia-split>Ask1ΔN: 2.22x10-4, and Ctxglia-split>Ask1-Flag: 2.66x10-4. n values
  can be found on each graph. n.s., not significant; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***,
  p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001.'
