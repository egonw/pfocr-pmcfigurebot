caption: A–FPhosTag probing from HA‐tagged YAP levels in AP180C transfection positive
  cells. Vector or AP180C plasmid was co‐transfected with HA‐YAP and YAP activation
  status in response to hydrostatic pressure is shown (PhosTag gel). Anti‐HA tag antibody
  was used to probe for HA‐tagged YAP. YAP phosphorylation levels in HEK293A (A) WT,
  (B) LATS1/2 DKO, (C) MST1/2 DKO, (D) M4K4/6/7 KO (M4K KO), (E) MST1/2‐M4K4/6/7 KO
  (5KO) and (F) MST1/2‐M4K1/2/3/4/6/7 KO (8KO) cells are shown.GImmunofluorescence
  images show AP180C positive cells in green and YAP in red. Hoechst highlights the
  nucleus (shown in blue). AP180C promotes nuclear exclusion of YAP in M4K KO but
  not MST1/2 DKO cells. Cells were transfected with Myc‐tagged AP180C and the subcellular
  localization of YAP was examined in response to hydrostatic pressure. Scale bar = 20 μm.HQuantification
  of nuclear‐to‐cytoplasmic ratio (Nucl/Cyt) of YAP in AP180C transfection positive
  cells compared to control using images as shown in (G). Each dot represents a single
  cell and error bars are mean ± 95% CI. Graph shows data obtained from three independent
  experiments. Mann–Whitney U test. P = 0.3516 (MST1/2 DKO) and P = 0.0001 (M4K KO).  Source
  data are available online for this figure.
