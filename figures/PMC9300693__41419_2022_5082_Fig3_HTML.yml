figure_title: Thiostrepton activates the STAT3–GPX4 signalling pathway
caption: 'A Western blotting analysis of FOXM1, SLC711A, and GPX4 protein levels,
  B qRT-PCR analysis of the GPX4 mRNA expression level, and C Western blotting analysis
  of the STAT3 and p-STAT3 protein levels in Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3 cells treated
  with TST (DMSO, 2, or 5 μM). D Representative IF images showing the expression of
  STAT3. The second antibody was labelled with FITC (green), and the nuclei were stained
  with DAPI (blue). E and F Western blotting and qRT-PCR analyses of the change in
  GPX4 expression caused by STAT3 overexpression in pancreatic cancer. G and H A conserved
  STAT3-binding motif was predicted by JASPAR, and schematic images of the potential
  STAT3 binding sites in the promoter of GPX4 are shown. I ChIP analysis of STAT3
  occupancy at the GPX4 promoter in Panc-1 cells. J Schematic images of luciferase
  reporter plasmids containing STAT3 binding sites (WT and MUT) in the GPX4 promoter
  region. K Luciferase reporter assays of 293T cells overexpressing STAT3 and transfected
  with reporter plasmids containing WT and MUT GPX4 promoters (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ns: not significant).'
