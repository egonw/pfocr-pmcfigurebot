caption: miR-29a-3p inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A)
  Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-29a-3p
  in A549 cells. (B) A Cell-Counting Kit-8 assay was used to measure cell proliferation
  after 24, 48, and 72 h. (C) An EdU assay was used to assess proliferation in the
  transfected cells (scale bar, 50 µm). (D) A wound healing assay was used to assess
  cell migration (scale bar, 50 µm). (E) Transwell assays were used to assess cell
  invasion (scale bar, 50 µm). A549 cells were transfected with NC, miR-29a-3p mimic
  or inhibitor. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control group. NC, negative control; NSCLC,
  non-small cell lung cancer; miR, microRNA.
