caption: Hypothetical schematic model showing the mechanism in WT and M3 plants against
  low-temperature stress. This model was developed by combining the results of the
  RNA-seq analysis with previously described schemes of plant abiotic stress response
  networks. Blue lines with arrows denote a certain regulation; and blue dotted lines
  with arrows denote an uncertain regulation. The various crosstalk and feedback of
  multiple pathways, such as the hormone signaling pathway, ROS signaling pathway,
  and secondary metabolic pathway, as well as the genes encoding TF families and stress-related
  genes are assumed to respond to low-temperature stress.
