caption: PS19 transgenic mice brain proteomic profile. (A) Graphical representation
  of the experimental timeline of this study including groups, drug treatment, biochemical
  and statistical analysis performed. (B) Levels of total tau (Tau) and phosphorylated
  tau (pTau)-181, −202, −231, and −396 in the brain of PS19 transgenic mice as compared
  to non-carrier (NC) mice measured with MSD ELISA. (C) Gene ontology enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed proteins in the brain of PS19 as compared to NC mice.
  Significantly enriched biological process, cellular components, and molecular functions
  are represented and were obtained with DAVID. (D) KEGG and Reactome pathway enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed proteins in the brain of PS19 as compared to
  NC mice. Bubble plot represents the top significant pathways.
