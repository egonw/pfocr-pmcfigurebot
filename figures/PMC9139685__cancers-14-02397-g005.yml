caption: 4EBP1 controls the translation of genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose
  metabolism, and the inositol pathway. (A) GSEA KEGG pathway analysis of 4EBP1-dependent
  (TE-down) genes. (B) TE (log2fold change) of key genes involved in insulin signaling.
  (C) Immunoblot validation translational downregulation of HK2 and upregulation of
  HK1 protein in a 4EBP1-dependent manner. B-actin was used as the loading control.
  Quantification of respective proteins is indicated as fold change (FC) normalized
  to b-actin and untreated cells. (D). Conserved RNA motifs enriched in the 5′UTR
  of mRNA that was downregulated in 4EBP1-4A-mutant-expressing cells compared to the
  background (Bkg) genes. (E) Luciferase assay showing relative translation activity
  of control (AT-rich) and GC-rich motifs in 293T cells expressing 4EBP1-4A (n = 6,
  p < 0.05). (F) Diagram showing the regulation of 4EBP1-dependent translation through
  4EBP1-sensitive RNA motifs in the 5′UTR. 4EBP1 regulated the translation of key
  proteins involved in insulin signaling.
