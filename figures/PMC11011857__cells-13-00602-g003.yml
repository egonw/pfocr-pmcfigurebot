caption: 'The main oncogenic pathways of KRAS activation are shown in the diagram:
  the MAPKinases [,] are on the left and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR [] are on the right. While
  the MAPKinases mediate proliferative signals, the PI3K pathway enhances survival,
  resistance to apoptosis and synthesis of essential molecules necessary for growth
  and proliferation. Oncogenic mutations in KRAS stabilizes its binding with GTP,
  leading to the constitutive activation of its downstream signaling.'
