caption: NSC-34 cells underwent different experimental treatments. In the upper frame,
  it the action of scratch injury technique is resumed on JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  and neurofilament cytoskeleton organization. Δ8-THC pre-treatment shows the ability
  to counteract the effects of scratch injury, as is illustrated in the lower frame.
