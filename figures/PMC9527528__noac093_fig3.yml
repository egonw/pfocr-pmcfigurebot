caption: H3F3A K27M mutation knockout reduces activated STAT3 levels and downstream
  signaling pathways. (A) Western blot of pSTAT3 (Y705) in K27M-mutant and H3K27M-KO
  SF8628 cells, as indicated. (B) H3K27M-KO SF8628-B23 cells remain viable in vitro
  but proliferate more slowly than K27M-mutant cells. (C) Volcano plot illustrating
  differentially expressed genes between H3K27M-KO and H3K27M-mutant cells. (Dâ€“G)
  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of H3K27M-mutant versus H3K27M-KO cells using
  gene sets including genes in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (D), known STAT3-associated
  genes (E), genes with putative STAT3-responsive elements within 4kb of the transcription
  start site (TSS, F) and genes known to be promoter-associated with STAT3 in ChIP-Seq
  data in other models (G). GSEA results are presented as normalized enrichment scores
  (NES), P values, and false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P values.
