caption: MXene‐Matrigel potentiated mTOR signaling pathway to promote hair cell differentiation.
  a‐d) MXene‐Matrigel enhanced mTOR signaling pathway of Cochlea‐Orgs. a) Immunoblots
  for HIF‐1α, β‐catenin, P‐AKT, AKT, P‐GSK3β, GSK3β, P‐S6, S6, and GAPDH using protein
  lysates of organoids cultured in MXene‐Matrigel and Matrigel after 5 days of differentiation.
  (n = 3, from one representative experiment, two independent experiments). b) Relative
  protein levels of HIF‐1α and β‐catenin were compared to GAPDH (n = 6, two independent
  experiments). c) Relative protein levels of P‐AKT, P‐GSK3β, and P‐S6 were quantified
  by comparing to AKT, GSK3β, and S6, respectively (n = 6, two independent experiments).
  d) Confocal images showed increased P‐S6 expression (red) in organoids of the MXene‐Matrigel
  group. Scale bar = 50 µm. e) Proportion of P‐S6+ cells in organoids (n = 6, two
  independent experiments). f–j) Hair cell formation was affected by regulating mTOR
  singling of organoids. (f) Confocal images of organoids cultured in the presence
  of mTOR activator MHY1485, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and DMSO control. Scale bar
  = 50 µm. Newly generated hair cells are labeled by Myo7a (red) and Atoh1‐GFP (green).
  Proportion of Myo7a+ cells (g) and Atoh1‐GFP+ hair cells (h) in organoids after
  5 days of treatment of MHY1485 and rapamycin (n = 6, two independent experiments).
  (i) Immunoblots for P‐AKT, AKT, P‐GSK3β, GSK3β, P‐S6, S6, and GAPDH using protein
  lysates of organoids cultured in MXene‐Matrigel and Matrigel after 5 days of differentiation
  (n = 3, from one representative experiment, three independent experiments). (j)
  Relative protein levels of P‐GSK3β and P‐S6 were quantified, respectively (n = 6,
  two independent experiments). k–m) Hair cell formation was affected by regulating
  mTOR singling of cochlear explants (n = 3, from independent mouse cochlear explants).
  (k) Confocal images of middle turn of MHY1485, rapamycin, and DMSO‐treated cochlear
  explants. Number of Atoh1+ hair cells (l) and Atoh1+ Sox2+ newly formed hair cells
  (m) after 4 days of treatment of MHY1485 and rapamycin. Scale bar = 50 µm. n) Immunoblots
  for P‐AKT, AKT, P‐GSK3β, GSK3β, P‐S6, S6, and GAPDH using protein lysates of cochlear
  explants after 4 days of treatment of MHY1485 and rapamycin (n = 3, from independent
  mouse cochlear explants). o) Relative protein levels of P‐AKT, P‐GSK3β, and P‐S6
  were quantified, respectively (n = 3, from independent mouse cochlear explants).
