caption: Model-2 responses to a “Zoom In” optic flow sequence. “Zoom In” represents
  frame in a radially inward flow. “DSMN Resp” represent the populations of neurons
  that are active in each tile to the input sequence. Hebbian network response (top
  view) is plotted under “HBNW Resp.” Each column is represented by a winner along
  with its direction preference (arrow). “OFNW Resp” represents the response of the
  classification layer nodes in MLP, each node is encoding specific flow type.
