caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A. GSEA plot of KEGG pathways enriched
  in ATRX-mt patients including antigen processing and presentation, natural killer
  cell mediated cytotoxicity, RIG I like receptor signaling pathway and T cell receptor
  signaling pathway. Nominal P-values and the false-discovery rate (FDR) are indicated.
  B. Heatmap of the immune-related KEGG pathways and tumor hallmarks quantified by
  gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The method of limma was used to make the differential
  analysis. The cutoff value of FDR < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
