caption: Synthetic routes for the synthesis of tetraethyl 1-(N-acylamino)alkylene-1,1-bisphosphonates
  from α-functionalized derivatives of phosphorus analogs of α-amino acids, such as
  diethyl 1-(N-benzoylamino)bromomethylphosphonate [] and diethyl 1-(N-acetylamino)-1-triphenylphosphoniumalkylphosphonate
  tetrafluoroborates 4 obtained from α-methoxyphosphonates (pathway a) [] or α-ethoxyphosphonates
  (pathway b) [].
article_title: One-Pot and Catalyst-Free Transformation of N-Protected 1-Amino-1-Ethoxyalkylphosphonates
  into Bisphosphonic Analogs of Protein and Non-Protein α-Amino Acids.
