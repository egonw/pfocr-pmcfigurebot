figure_title: Induction of an injured transcriptional state in DRG neurons after glial
  cell loss
caption: (A) Eight-week-oldPLP-CreERT;ROSA26-eGFP-DTA mice and Cre-negative ROSA26-eGFP-DTA
  mice (used as control) were injected with tamoxifen, and L3-L5 DRGs were dissected
  for snRNA-seq studies at PID21 and PID42. tSNE plot of 14,065 nuclei from Cre-negative
  ROSA26-eGFP-DTA mice (no disease) and PLP-CreERT;ROSA26-eGFP-DTA mice at PID21 and
  PID42. Nine naive cell types, including glial cells and different subtypes of sensory
  neurons, and one cluster of injured nuclei were identified. Nuclei are colored by
  cell type (left) or condition (right).(B) Bar plot showing average percentage of
  nuclei that are in the injured cluster across duplicates in each condition (n =
  2). Error bars denote standard deviations. Two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare
  the percentages across conditions. F(2, 3) = 13.74, p = 0.03. PID21 shows significant
  increase in injured nuclei compared with no disease control (Bonferroni post hoc,
  p = 0.03).(C) Dot plot displaying the relative gene expression of marker genes (columns)
  in the injured cluster and each naive cell type (rows). The fraction of nuclei expressing
  a marker gene is calculated as the number of nuclei in each cell type that express
  a gene (>0 counts) divided by the total number of nuclei in the respective cell
  type. Relative expression in each cell type is calculated as mean expression of
  a gene relative to the highest mean expression of that gene across all cell types.(D)
  Overlap between the common neuronal injury-induced genes in SpNT (see ) and marker
  genes in the injured cluster (log2FC > 0.25, p < 0.05, comparing nuclei from the
  injured cluster with all other nuclei) (hypergeometric test, p = 2e-102).(E) Reactome
  pathway analysis of the genes induced only by demyelination.(F) Cellular component
  analysis of the genes induced only by demyelination.(G) Reactome pathway analysis
  of the genes induced only by SpNT.(H) Reactome pathway analysis of the genes induced
  by both SpNT and demyelination.
