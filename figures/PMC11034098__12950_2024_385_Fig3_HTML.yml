caption: 'Crtc1 Silencing attenuates LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis in RAW264.7
  cells. (A) Validation of Crtc1 knockdown in in RAW264.7 cells treated with Crtc1-specific
  or negative control siRNAs using qRT-PCR. *P < 0.05; n = 3. (B-E) qRT-PCR showing
  the impact of Crtc1 knockdown on LPS-induced cytokines, such as TNF-α (B), IL-1β
  (C), IL-6 (D), and CXCL1 (E) in RAW264.7 cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. siNeg;##P < 0.01,
  ###P < 0.001 vs. Control; n = 6. (F, G) Representative TUNEL staining images (F)
  and quantification data (G) showing the impact of Crtc1 knockdown on LPS-induced
  apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. **P < 0.01 vs. siNeg; ###P < 0.001 vs. Control; n = 3.
  (H-K) Western blot (H) and quantification (I-K) showing the impact of Crtc1 knockdown
  on LPS-induced alternations in Cleaved-caspase3/Caspase3 (I), Bcl-2 (J) and Bax
  (K) in RAW264.7 cells. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. siNeg; #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001
  vs. Control; n = 3'
