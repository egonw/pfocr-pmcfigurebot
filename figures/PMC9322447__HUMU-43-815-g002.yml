caption: Fibrillins control transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) signaling. Through
  the sequestration of the large latent complex (LLC), consisting of the small latent
  complex (SLC) and TGF‐β ligands, and the interactions with integrins on the cell
  surface, fibrillins control TGF‐β signaling. Both the noncanonical (or SMAD‐independent)
  pathway (blue) and the canonical (SMAD‐dependent) pathway (green) are depicted.
