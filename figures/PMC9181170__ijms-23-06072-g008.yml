caption: Transcriptomics revealed that baicalin regulates lipid metabolism and bile
  secretion. Fold change of differential expressed genes related to (A) fatty acid
  degradation and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and (B) bile secretion,
  PPAR signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. (C) The process of fatty acid
  degradation, peroxisome, fatty acid biosynthesis, and bile secretion. (D) The process
  of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. The red words indicate upregulation
  and green words indicate downregulation.
