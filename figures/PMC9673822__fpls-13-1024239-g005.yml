caption: Putative gastrodin biosynthesis pathway in P. chinensis. This pathway was
  constructed based on the KEGG pathway (map00940, map01061) and literature references.
  The expression levels deduced from the RMPK of each Unigene that encodes the relevant
  enzyme, were shown as heat map, whereas roots (triplicates as B11, B12, B13), rhizomes
  (triplicates as B21, B22, B23), pseudobulbs (triplicates as B31, B32, B33) and leaves
  (triplicates as B41, B42, B43) were separately analyzed. The expression value was
  calculated based on the Log2 Fold change. Red and blue represented high and low
  expression levels, respectively. Non-dashed line arrows represent identified enzymatic
  reactions, and dashed line arrows represent multiple enzymatic reactions through
  multiple steps.
