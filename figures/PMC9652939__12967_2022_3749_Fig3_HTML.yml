caption: MICAL1 promoted PC cell proliferation and metastasis in vivo. A–C The tumor
  substances (A), volumes (B) and tumor weight (C) of subcutaneous tumor in different
  groups. D Representative IHC staining of MICAL1, Ki67, and PCNA in tumor tissues
  isolated from different nude mice groups. E, F Representative H&E (E) and statistic
  (F) of pulmonary metastasis focis from different nude mice groups. Values are means ± SD
  of five individuals per group (n = 5). Statistical differences were determined by
  two-sided Student’s t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01
