caption: Effect of ITGA5 on proliferation, invasion and migration of gastric cancer
  cells. (a–b) Effect of ITGA5 on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by CCK8
  cell proliferation assay. ITGA5 overexpression promoted the proliferation of AGS
  and MKN-28 cells, while ITGA5 silencing inhibited the proliferation of AGS and MKN-28
  cells. (c) ITGA5 expression promoted the clonogenic ability of AGS and MKN-28 cells
  (100× magnification). ITGA5 silencing inhibited the clonogenic ability of AGS and
  MKN-28 cells (100× magnification). (d–e) ITGA5 overexpression promoted the invasion
  and migration ability of AGS and MKN-28 cells (100× magnification). ITGA5 silencing
  inhibited the invasion migration ability of AGS and MKN-28 cells (100× magnification).
  Results are expressed as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P
  < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001 by t-test). ITGA5 gene promotes the growth of subcutaneous
  tumor in nude mice in vivo.
