caption: PKA activation enhanced lipid synthesis in human meibomian gland epithelial
  cells (HMGECs). (A) HMGECs were treated with forskolin, and the phosphorylation
  of CREB at ser133 residue was assessed by immunoblotting in serial and dose escalation
  manners. After treatment with forskolin (1 μM), the CREB phosphorylation was assessed
  with time. CREB phosphorylation was highest at 30 min after treatment and decreased
  thereafter. After forskolin was treated by concentration, CREB phosphorylation was
  observed 30 min later. CREB phosphorylation increased with forskolin concentration
  (the sum of 3 and 4 experiments, respectively). (B–D) HMGECs were cultured with
  or without forskolin (1 μM; forskolin was treated at day 0 and 2). (B,C) mRNA and
  protein expression of PPARγ and SREBP-1 were assessed by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting
  at day 0, 2, and 4 (the sum of 3 and 4 experiments respectively). (D,E) Lipid accumulation
  was measured by AdipoRed assay and LipidTOX assay at day 4, and the results of three
  experiments are summarized. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the
  mean. D, day after differentiation; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
