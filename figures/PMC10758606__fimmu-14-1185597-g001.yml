caption: Schematic of canonical and non-canonical NFκB activation in B cell. TLR and
  IgM-mediated BCR signaling activate the canonical NFκB pathway (, ). IgD-mediated
  BCR signaling may activate both the canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathway (,
  ). CD40 and BAFF activate the canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways (). The
  canonical signaling activates NEMO and IKK1/2 containing complex. The activated
  IKK1/2 phosphorylates members of the IκBs (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε here referred as
  IκBα/β/ε) bound with NFκB, leading to the degradation of IκBα/β/ε. The degradation
  of IκBα/β/ε releases IκB-bound NFκB, which translocates to the nucleus. The activated
  IKK1/2 phosphorylates IκB-like molecule p105, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  of p105 generates p50 with the formation of RelA:p50, cRel:p50 and p50:p50 (, ,
  ). RelA:p50 and cRel:p50 dimers are transcriptional activators. p50:p50 dimer may
  function as a transcriptional inhibitor and are present in naïve mature B cell ().
  B cell activation by canonical pathway replaces p50:p50 with RelA:p50 and cRel:p50
  (, ). The non-canonical signaling stabilizes NIK and subsequent activation of IKK1.
  The activated IKK1 phosphorylates IκB-like molecule p100 and generates p52. The
  degradation of RelB-bound p100 generates RelB:p52 dimer, and its nuclear translocation
  (). The multimeric association of p100 generates IκBδ. IκBδ remains predominantly
  bound with cRel:p50 and RelA:p50 dimers. The activated IKK1 degrades IκBδ and releases
  cRel:p50 and RelA:p50 dimers to the nucleus (, ).
