caption: YZH attenuated NASH by inhibiting the hepatic TLR4, MyD88, NFκB pathway.
  (A) The expressions of TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-IκBα, NFκB and p-NFκB in the liver tissues
  of the 3 groups of mice were detected by Western Blot; (B) protein levels of TLR4,
  MyD88, IκBα, p-IκBα, NFκB and p-NFκB in 3 groups were calculated. Data were shown
  as mean ± SD. **P<0.01; ****P<0.0001. YZH, yinzhihuang; NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis;
  TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88;
  NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B; IκBα, inhibitor of NFκB alpha.
