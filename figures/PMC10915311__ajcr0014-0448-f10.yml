caption: Effect of NTSR1 knockdown in KPC on interaction with neuron in orthotopic
  animal model. Pan-cytokeratin (Pan-CK)-positive pancreatic cancer and TUBB3-positive
  neuron were costained in mouse tumors of shLuc-KPC or shNTSR1-KPC, and area of PDAC
  surrounding neuron was analyzed. **, P<0.01. Scale bar, 50 Î¼m.
