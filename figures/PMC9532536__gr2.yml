caption: The effects of CuB on FOXM1/PLK1–KIF20A pathway in conjunctival melanoma
  cells were determined by transcriptomics, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. (A)
  Venn diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each
  set of experiments, highlighting a total of 32 DEGs commonly identified from the
  two CuB-treated (0.1 and 0.2 μmol/L) sets of experiments (n = 3). (B) RNA sequencing
  cluster analysis chart of above 32 DEGs (n = 3). (C) and (D) KIF20A expression after
  CuB treatment (0.1 and 0.2 μmol/L). (C) Relative mRNA expression of KIF20A (n = 3),
  data represent three independent experiments. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA. (D) Protein
  expression of KIF20A (n = 3), data are representative of at least three independent
  experiments. (E) and (F) FOXM1 and PLK1 levels after CuB treatment (0.1 and 0.2 μmol/L).
  (E) Relative mRNA expression of FOXM1 and PLK1 (n = 3), data represent three independent
  experiments. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA. (F) Protein expression of FOXM1 and PLK1
  (n = 3), data is representative of at least three independent experiments. (G) Protein
  expression of KIF20A, PLK1 and FOXM1 in CM-AS16, CRMM1, CM2005.1 and HL7702 cells
  (n = 3), data are representative of at least three independent experiments.
