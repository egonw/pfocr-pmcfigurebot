caption: ST2825 inhibits AKT1 expression and induces p21 overexpression by inhibiting
  the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.
  (A) Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of NF-κB family proteins
  in the cytoplasm and nuclear extracts of PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825. (B) Immunostaining
  results of phosphorylated-p65 and DAPI in PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825 as imaged
  by confocal microscopy. (C) Value of the absorbance at 450 nM of nuclear p65/dsDNA
  ELISA in PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825. (D) RT-qPCR analysis was used to determine
  the expression of AKT1, CDKN1A(p21) and CYCLIN D1 from the ChIP of p65-complex in
  PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825. (E) RT-qPCR analysis was used to determine the
  expression of AKT1, CDKN1A(p21) and CYCLIN D1 in PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825.
  (F) Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of AKT1 and phosphorylated-AKT1
  in PANC-1 cells treated with ST2825. (G) Western blot analysis was used to determine
  the expression of p21 in the cytoplasm and nuclear extracts of PANC-1 cells treated
  with ST2825. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. The t-test and Bonferroni test were used for statistical analysis,
  *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001; N.S., not significant. p, phosphorylated; RT-qPCR, reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR; NC, negative control; ST, ST2825.
