caption: 'Downstream roles of lysosomes.Lysosomes are the final effectors of both
  the ALP and the endosome pathway, mediating the degradation of the cargo that is
  delivered to them. In ALP, autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic contents (molecules
  and organelles), and fuse with lysosomes where the hydrolases degrade the cargo
  into essential constituents (a). Endosomes, on the other hand, collect cargo from
  the plasma membrane and/or the extracellular environment. Then, they sort cargoes
  into different possible cellular destinations, one of which is the lysosomes for
  the degradation of the endosomal content (b). In addition to these catabolic roles,
  lysosomes also function as signaling organelles. They constitute important intracellular
  Ca2+ stores, which can be released in the cytoplasm via specialized channels on
  their membrane (the most characterized so far being TPC1/2 and TRPML1/3). These
  characteristics make lysosomes versatile organelles which are very likely to play
  different roles in cellular physiology. Created with BioRender.com. ALP: Autophagy-lysosome
  pathway; Ca2+: calcium; TPCs: two-pore channels; TRPMLs: transient receptor potential
  mucolipin.'
