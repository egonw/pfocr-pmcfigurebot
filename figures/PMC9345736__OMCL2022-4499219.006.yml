caption: Inhibition of CTSB with CA-074Me mitigated the severity of NaT-induced pancreatitis.
  AP was induced by NaT. CA-074Me was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before
  the injection of NaT. (a) Representative graphs of H&E-stained pancreatic tissue
  (n=6 per group, scale bar 100 μm). (b) Histological scores from NaT-induced pancreatitis
  (n=6 per group). ELISA of (c) amylase and (d) lipase in serum (n=6 per group). (e)
  Expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in pancreas detected by RT-qPCR (n=6 per group). (f,
  g) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL proteins of
  pancreas in mice treated with NaT (n=4 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001.
