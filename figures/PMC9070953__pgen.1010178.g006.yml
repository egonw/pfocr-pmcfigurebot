figure_title: Insulin-signaling pathway acting downstream of DAF-2 receptors
caption: (A) Schematic of a neuron’s daf-2-mediated canonical and non-canonical insulin
  signaling. Summary of the findings in B. Created with Biorender.com (B) Standard
  sensory integration assay performed with mutants in the canonical insulin signaling
  pathway (age-1, daf-18, pdk-1, akt-1, akt-2, and daf-16,), alongside wildtype N2
  N≥7. (C) Summary of data and proposed model through which food deprivation alters
  animal behavior. B was analyzed using two-way ANOVA, determined to have significant
  differences across well-fed and food-deprived conditions. WF/FD comparisons were
  then performed as pairwise comparisons within each genotype or treatment as t-tests
  with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. * p<0.5, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, ****
  p<0.0001, ns p>0.05.
