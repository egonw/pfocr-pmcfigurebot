caption: Sufentanil enhances the viability of OGD/R-induced HCMECs. (A) The chemical
  structure formula of sufentanil. (B) The viability of HCMECs was detected using
  CCK-8. (C) The viability of OGD/R-induced HCMECs was detected using CCK-8. (D) The
  LDH activity was detected using LDH assay. Data are expressed as the mean Â± SD.
  *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. OGD/R, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation; HCMECs,
  human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; LDH,
  lactate dehydrogenase.
article_title: Sufentanil ameliorates oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced
  endothelial barrier dysfunction in HCMECs via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
