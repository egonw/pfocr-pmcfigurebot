caption: Determination of 5-hydroxytryotamine (5-HT) signaling pathway in mice with
  loperamide-induced constipation (LOP) after treatment with Ligilactobacillus salivarius
  Li01 (Li01), Weileshu probiotic (WLS), and the control group (NC). The levels of
  5-HT in serum (A) and colon tissue (B) were measured. (C) Representative fluorescent
  images of 5-HT in colonic tissues. The scale bars represent 30 µm. (D) The mRNA
  expression levels of Tph1, SERT, 5-HTR3, and 5-HTR4. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM, n = 6. Significant differences are denoted by “ns” (p ≥ 0.05), * (p < 0.05),
  ** (p < 0.01), *** (p < 0.001), and **** (p < 0.0001).
