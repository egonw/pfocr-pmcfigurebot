caption: Expression changes in plant-hormone signaling and MAPK signaling—plant pathways
  in XY15 (cold-sensitive) and GX74 (cold-tolerant) rapeseed siliques—in response
  to cold treatment. The pathways are drawn according to the respective reference
  pathways in KEGG pathway database []. The heatmap was drawn in TBtools [] using
  the log2 foldchange values of differentially expressed genes enriched in these two
  pathways. CK and LW represent control and cold treatments. The gene abbreviations
  and other genes refer to full names presented in .

  Cold Responses in Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) Genotypes with Contrasting Cold-Stress
  Sensitivity.
