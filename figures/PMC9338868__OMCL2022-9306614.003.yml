caption: Characterization of NHE1 promoter activity responded to Etoposide. (a) SLC9A1
  promoter activity responded to serum deprivation. (b) Luciferase activity in K562
  cells transfected with PGL3-1360 and incubated with Etoposide at different final
  concentrations was detected. (c) Response of PGL3-1360 and its progressive deletion
  regions in K562 cells to Etoposide was clarified by relative luciferase activity.
  (d) A schematic diagram of the proximal SLC9A1 promoter indicating 2 potential OCT1
  transcription factor binding sites. (e) Biotinylated oligo pull-down assay was performed
  to show the binding between OCT1 and target sequence. Data was shown as mean ± s.e.m.
  of triplicate assays. ∗P < 0.05. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗∗∗P < 0.001. ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
