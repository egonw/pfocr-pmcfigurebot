caption: 'Pathology of multiple sclerosis and mechanism of available disease-modifying
  therapies in China. IFN-β could affect multiple levels of cellular functions to
  increase the levels of anti-inflammatory agents and reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. GA is a noninterferon immunomodulator, which has a similar effect as
  that of IFN-β on multiple levels of cellular functions. Teriflunomide is a selective,
  non-competitive, reversible inhibitor of dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (DHODH),
  which prevents the proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes in the periphery. DMF is
  defined as the Nrf2 activator, which could further activate Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling
  pathway to extert its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. S1PRMs have
  a dual action on S1PRs as the pharmacological antagonists or agonists to prevent
  the lymphocyte exit into circulation from secondary lymphoid organs. Anti-CD20s
  could directly target CD20+ B cells to deplete B cells.Letters in red: DMTs approved
