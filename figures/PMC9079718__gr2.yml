caption: 'MG53 rejuvenates senescent hUC-MSCs. (A) Representative images of β-gal
  staining. Scale bar = 200 μm. (B) Representative images of Lamin B1 cellular immunofluorescence.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. (C) Quantitative analysis of β-gal-positive cells. (D) Analysis
  of fluorescence of Lamin B1. (E) Western blots of P16, P21, P53, PCNA and Sirt1
  protein. (F) Grey analysis of P16, P21, P53, PCNA and Sirt1 protein. (G) Human inflammation
  array was used to detect the release of SASP in different groups. Data were presented
  as mean ± SEM. N = 3 per group. *: Compared with P5 group, P < 0.05; #: Compared
  with P10 group, P < 0.05; Δ: Compared with P15, P < 0.05.'
