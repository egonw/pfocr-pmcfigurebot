caption: 'Upregulation of immune pathway genes and downregulation of antimicrobial
  response genes in the islets of 12-week-old NOD vs. NOD.B10 mice. Differentially
  expressed genes belonging to the Th17 cell differentiation (A, KEGG 4659), Natural
  killer-mediated cytotoxicity (B, KEGG 4650), or T cell receptor signaling (C, KEGG
  4660) pathways that are significantly changed in the islets of 12-week-old NOD vs.
  NOD.B10 mice. D: Highly downregulated genes in the islets of 12-week-old NOD vs.
  NOD.B10 mice that belong to GO term 9617: Response to Bacterium. E and F: QPCR was
  performed to confirm the reduced expression of Defb1 and Hamp expression using a
  separate cohort of 12-week-old NOD and NOD.B10 mice. The mean ± SEM are shown, and
  statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student unpaired t test
  or the Mann-Whitney test (Supplementary Table 6). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Panels
  A–D were generated using iPathwayGuide.'
