caption: Insulin signaling pathway mechanism. Upon insulin receptors binding to ligands,
  leading to self-phosphorylation, insulin receptor substrates (IRS) are recruited
  and phosphorylated. IRS proteins are then recruited and activate PI3K, which phosphorylates
  PIP2 to generate PIP3. PDK1 is then activated by PIP3, which phosphorylates Akt
  at Thr308. Insulin activation of Akt enhances both the synthesis and processing
  of SREBP (SREBP1c mainly) in hepatocytes. SREBP1c and ChREBP activate lipogenic
  genes such as Fasn, ACC, Scd1 and Elovl6. At low cellular ATP levels, activation
  of AMPK interacts with and phosphorylates SREBP1c, thus inhibiting proteolytic cleavage
  and nuclear translocation, and repressing DNL. Similar to SREBP1c, FoxO proteins
  are also the class of transcription factors downstream of INS signaling pathway,
  and Akt controls the activity of the FoxO proteins through a phosphorylation mechanism.
  FoxO1 can bind to the SREBP1c promoter directly and further affect the transcriptional
  activity of Sp1 and SREBP1c. FoxO1 controls the expression of the glucokinase gene
  which may promote the lipogenic response by increasing glucose-6-phosphate levels
  and activating ChREBP. FoxO6 stimulated hepatic production of microsomal triglyceride
  transfer protein (MTP), which catalyzed the transfer of lipid to nascent apolipoprotein
  B (apoB), a rate-limiting step in the nascent assembly and secretion of VLDL.
