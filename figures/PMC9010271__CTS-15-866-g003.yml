caption: 'Sankey diagram. Drug pathway map representing the pharmacogenes functionally
  disrupted in more than 10 percent of the Indian population. The first column represents
  the broad drug category associated with the potentially deleterious variants in
  the Indian population. The second, third, and fourth columns represent the pharmacogenes
  belonging to the classes: transporter/carriers, enzymes, and targets, respectively.
  The link width represents the degree of functional loss of the given drug in terms
  of the pharmacogene classes'
