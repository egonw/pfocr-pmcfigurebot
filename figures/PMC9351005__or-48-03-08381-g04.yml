caption: Cx32 modulates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (A) Expression level of p-Akt
  in HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumorous liver samples assessed by immunohistochemistry.
  (B) Rate of positive expression of p-Akt in HCC samples and corresponding paracarcinoma
  tissues. (C) Expression of p-Akt and total Akt examined by western blotting following
  transfection of HepG2 cells with shRNA-Cx32. (D) Expression of p-Akt and total Akt
  when HCCLM3 cells were overexpressed with Cx32. (E) Results represent the mean ±
  SEM from three independent experiments; *P<0.05 vs. the NC group or EV group. The
  proteins were normalized with β-actin. Cx32, connexin 32; PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/protein kinase B; p-, phosphorylated; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; shRNA,
  small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; EV, empty vector; PT, paracarcinoma
  tissues.
