caption: GSVA analysis of single cells from 4T1 mice. (A) Differential hallmark pathway
  activities in the PTX+CKI group versus the saline group. (B) Differential hallmark
  pathway activities in the PTX+CKI group versus the PTX group. (C) Heatmap showing
  enrichment scores (based on the signatures developed by Bagaev et al.) in the four
  groups. (D) Difference in the enrichment scores of the signatures related to cytotoxic
  T and NK cells among the four groups (based on the signatures developed by Bagaev
  et al.). (E) Heatmap showing T cell enrichment scores (based on the signatures developed
  by Sun et al.) in the four groups. (F) Difference in the T cell enrichment scores
  (based on the signatures developed by Sun et al.) among the four groups. (G) Difference
  in the T cell enrichment scores (based on the signatures developed by Sun et al.)
  between the PTX+CKI group and the PTX group. ***P < 0.001.
