caption: 'Effects of PN-101 on LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 expression in PMA-treated
  THP-1 cells. PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages were administered with 1 μg/ml LPS alone
  or pretreated with PN-101 prior to LPS administration. (A) TNF-α and IL-6 productions
  were measured at 4 h and 48 h by ELISA. PN-101 attenuated TNF-α and IL-6 production
  induced by LPS. (B) mRNA expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined by
  quantitative real-time RT-PCR. PN-101 reduced expression of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs
  stimulated by LPS. (C) PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages were transfected with a plasmid
  containing TNF-α promoter driving firefly luciferase. Transfected cells were treated
  with PN-101 at 1 h prior to LPS stimulation. The basal level of luciferase activity
  was normalized to 1. All experiments were performed three times independently. Results
  are presented as mean ± SD. ###P < 0.001 vs. control group, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001 vs. LPS.'
