caption: 'Changes in the metabolic pathway of energy synthesis in mouse skeletal muscles
  compared with blood or early infected samples. (A) Concentration of the TCA cycle
  metabolites in skeletal muscles at 9 h after infection. The samples were divided
  into four groups, as follows: PBS-treated leg (PBS), V. vulnificus-injected leg
  (Vv), leg opposite the PBS-treated leg (OP), and leg opposite the V. vulnificus-injected
  leg (OV) (3/group). (B) Concentrations of the TCA cycle metabolites in whole blood
  were extracted from CE-TOFMS data at 9 h after infection (3 to 5/group). (C) The
  number of bacteria in skeletal muscle tissues was estimated using the CFU assay.
  The bacteria were collected in skeletal muscles after 1, 3, and 9 h of infection
  by V. vulnificus (4/group). (D) Metabolites of the arginine-to-creatinine pathway
  in skeletal muscles were extracted from CE-TOFMS data at 3 h after infection (4/group).
  (E) Metabolites of the TCA cycle in skeletal muscles were extracted from CE-TOFMS
  data at 3 h after infection (4/group). Each bar indicates the mean concentration.
  *, P < 0.05, and **, P < 0.01, versus the control group (by t test). One-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s test was used to determine the differences in each group. P values
  were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. †, FDR < 0.05, versus
  the Vv group.'
