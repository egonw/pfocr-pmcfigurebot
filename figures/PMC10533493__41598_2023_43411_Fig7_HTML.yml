caption: Schematic depicts the critical role of TGFβ1/Serpin E1 in promoting diabetes-accelerated
  kidney aging and injury via driving renal tubular premature senescence and degeneration.
  In diabetes mellitus, elevated renal expression of TGFβ1 promotes Serpin E1 secretion
  in tubular epithelial cells, which, in turn, act on cells in an autocrine or paracrine
  manner. Subsequently, Serpin E1 elicits renal tubular senescence, characterized
  by staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, increased p16INK4A
  expression and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes. These effects work synergistically
  to contribute to tubular cell degeneration and impairments, and ultimately lead
  to diabetic kidney disease progression. This pathogenic pathway could be intercepted
  by TM5441, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of Serpin E1.
