caption: BMSCs inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway and reduce inflammation in SAP
  via inducing Nrf2 nuclear translocation. A–D The expressions of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were significantly decreased by BMSCs, while the
  expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) were significantly increased.
  In addition, ML385 partially inhibited the anti-inflammatory effects of BMSCs. E,
  F Nuclear protein level of NF-κB p65 and total protein level of IKKβ were measured
  by Western blot. NF-κB p65 levels in the nucleus were decreased and the expression
  of IKKβ was increased after BMSCs treatment, while injection of ML385 increased
  NF-κB p65 levels in SAP + BMSCs + ML385 group. G, H Immunohistochemistry showed
  the nuclear enrichment of NF-κB p65. Data are shown as mean ± SD for at least 3
  separate experiments. (In H, × 200 magnification; n = 6 per group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  and ***p < 0.001)
