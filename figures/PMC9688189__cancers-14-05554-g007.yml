caption: Analysis of clinical relevance. (A) Kaplan–Meier analysis for hsa-miR-200c
  expression in breast cancer patients. Overall survival is depicted. (B) Kaplan–Meier
  plot for the relapse-free survival of GSTM3 expressing patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  and basal subtype were used as cohort. (C) Graphical summary and hypothesized mechanism
  of action of hsa-miR-200c and its target GSTM3 in cancer cells. Potential detoxification
  pathway of a hsa-miR-200c positive cell upon treatment with xenobiotics such as
  doxorubicin. (D) Putative mechanism of resistance formation in hsa-miR-200c negative
  cells.
