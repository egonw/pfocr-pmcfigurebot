caption: Ursolic acid activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway after unilateral ureteral
  obstruction in rats. (a) represents Western blots of related protein expression
  in rat kidney tissues of different groups; (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) represent
  the expression of Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, TGF-β1, and 8-oxo-dG mRNA in the kidney tissues
  of rats in different groups, respectively; (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) represent
  the expression of Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, TGF-β1, and 8-oxo-dG protein content, respectively,
  in the kidney tissue of rats in different groups; ∗means P < 0.05; ∗∗means P < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗means P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗means P < 0.0001.
