caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PEDV replication. Sub-confluent cells were incubated
  with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, after which the cells were infected with PEDV.
  After 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed with PBS and then cultured with 1,25(OH)2D3
  (20 nM) for another 24 h. Then, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis (A)
  and PEDV-N mRNA and protein determination (B). IPEC-J2 cells were incubated with
  1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, and then the cells were transfected with poly(I:C)
  by Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) for an additional 24 h. Finally, the
  cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis (C). * p < 0.05.
