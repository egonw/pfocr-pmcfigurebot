caption: Cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion increased inflammatory factors and activated
  the TLR4, NLRP3 inflammasome, and autophagy pathways in diabetic mice. (a) Top,
  western blot images of MCP-1 and TNF-α in DM mice in the sham and MCAO groups (n
  = 3 in each group). Bottom, the expression of MCP-1 (left) and TNF-α (right, n =
  6 in each group). (b) Top, western blot images of TLR4 and MyD88 (n = 3 in each
  group). Bottom, the expression of TLR4 (left) and MyD88 (right, n = 6 in each group).
  (c) Top, western blot images of p-NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins
  (n = 3 in each group). Middle, the expression of p-NF-κB p65 (left) and NLRP3 (right).
  Bottom, the expression of caspase-1 (left) and IL-1β (right, n = 6 in each group).
  (d) Top, western blot images of autophagy-related proteins (n = 3 in each group).
  Middle, the expression of LC3B (left) and p62 (right). Bottom, the expression of
  Beclin-1 (n = 6 in each group). ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
