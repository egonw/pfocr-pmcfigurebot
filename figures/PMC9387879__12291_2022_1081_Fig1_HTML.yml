caption: Structure of RAGEs and roles of RAGE/ligand axis in pro-inflammatory pathways.
  A RAGEâ€™s extracellular domain structure is composed of the constant domain (C1 and
  C2) and a variable domain (V); RAGE ligands (endogenous and exogenous) bind to the
  extracellular domains of RAGE. Cytoplasmic ligands such as mDia1 bind to the cytoplasmic
  domain of the RAGE. B Soluble isoforms of RAGE (sRAGE) are included esRAGE and cRAGE;
  esRAGE is constructed through alternative splicing on the RAGE mRNA, and cRAGE is
  formed through ADAM10 activity in the extracellular space. C Binding of RAGE ligands
  (mDia1, AGEs, etc.) to RAGE and its dimerization have significant roles in the inflammatory
  response in cells through regulation of cellular pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR,
  MAPK/P38, JAC2/ STAT3, and other pointed pathways in the figure.Source The Authors
