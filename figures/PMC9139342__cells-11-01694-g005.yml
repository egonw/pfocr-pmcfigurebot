caption: Secretion of VEGF in NSCLC cell lines. For the analysis 3.75 × 106 H2170-P/ER,
  H358-P/ER, H1975, and H3255 cells were plated in vented flasks and allowed to adhere
  for 24 h in RPMI medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h, medium was removed, followed by
  PBS washes, and then starving medium (RPMI + 0.5% BSA) was added and incubated for
  24 h. The medium was then centrifuged, and the pellets were stored in −70 °C. Collection
  of conditioned medium was repeated for 24 h and 48 h time points. The amount of
  VEGF in (A) H2170-P/ER, (B) H358-P/ER, and (C) H1975 and H3255 NSCLC cell lines
  was quantified at two time points, 24 and 48 h, and the experiments were run in
  triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed, and the results were found to be
  statistically significant (* = p < 0.05) by way of a two-tailed t-test analysis.
  One asterisk (*) denotes statistical significance in VEGF secretion at two different
  time points in parental (A, B) or EGFR double-mutant (C) cell lines, whereas two
  asterisks (**) denote statistical significance in VEGF secretion at two different
  time points in Erlotinib-resistant cell lines (A, B) or EGFR single-mutant cell
  lines.
