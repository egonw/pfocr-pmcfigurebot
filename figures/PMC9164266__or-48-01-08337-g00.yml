caption: RNF138 regulates the protein levels of HIF-1α, VEGF and MMP2 in glioma cell
  lines. (A) Western blotting analysis of HIF-1α, VEGF and MMP2 expression in U87
  and U251 cells, β-actin was used as a loading control. Densitometry analysis of
  (B) HIF-1α, (C) VEGF and (D) MMP2 expression in U87 and U251 cells using ImageJ
  analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation for three independent
  experiments. **P<0.01. RNF138, ring finger protein 138; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  MMP2, matrix metalloproteinase 2.
