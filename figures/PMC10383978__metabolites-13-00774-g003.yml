caption: 'Distinct capacity of MSeA, selenite, and SeM in blocking glutaminolysis
  in A549 and H1299 cells. A549 or H1299 cells were treated with 5 µM MSeA, 6.25 µM
  selenite, or 500 µM SeM for 24 h with 13C5,15N2-Gln (n = 2) as tracer, as described
  in Methods. Polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-MS (A–G). Pathways shown track
  12C (●), 14N (◆), 13C from glutaminolysis + PDH-initiated Krebs cycle (●), 13C from
  glutaminolysis + Krebs cycle + ME (●)/ME + PC (●) or glutaminolysis + reductive
  carboxylation (RedC, ●), and 15N (◆) from glutaminolysis/transamination; not all
  expected 13C and/or 15N labeled products are shown. The color bars (■, ■, ■, ■)
  denote the 13C isotopologues related to the labeled products in the pathway scheme.
  m1-6: 13C1-6 isotopologues; GLS: glutaminase; IDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase; ME:
  malic enzyme; ACL: ATP-citrate lyase; LDH, PDH, PC, AST: abbreviations as in  and
  . See  for statistical analysis.'
