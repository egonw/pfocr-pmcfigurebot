caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of HLD1 and HLD2. (A) PLP1 mutant
  and high-dose PLP1 protein cause hypomyelination and/or demyelination. Misfolded
  PLP1 protein (red) mainly accumulates at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and leads
  to ER stress and apoptosis. Excess PLP1 protein localizes in late endosomes and
  lysosomes. These events in oligodendrocytes are associated with subsequent demyelination.
  (B) Complexes of connexin (CX)47–CX47, CX47–CX43, or CX43–CX43 form functional gap
  junctions in oligodendrocytes (OL) and/or astrocytes (AS). Mutation in CX47 causes
  CX47 mislocalization and dysfunction of connexin-mediated glia–glia that leads to
  ER stress, activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, and abnormal cell
  morphology.
