caption: 'Effect of LEO on the Nrf2 signaling pathway. The protein expression levels
  of Nrf2 and HO-1 were determined by western blot analysis. Data are presented as
  the mean Â± standard deviation of three independent experiments. ***P<0.001 vs. control;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. LPS. HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; LEO, leonurine; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.'
