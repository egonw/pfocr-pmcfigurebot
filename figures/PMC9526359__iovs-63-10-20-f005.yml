caption: Effect of downregulation of METTL3 on corneal stromal cells co-cultured with
  F. solani. (A) Microscopic images of downregulated METTL3 fungal co-cultured corneal
  stromal cells were observed by scratch experiments. (B) The gap area percentage
  and mobility were analyzed by Image J. (C–E) The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α were significantly lower in the small interfering RNA targeting METTL3 (si-METTL3)
  group compared with the FS group. (F) The CCK-8 assay showed that the activity of
  corneal stromal cells in mice with low METTL3 expression was significantly higher
  than that in controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001; n = 6.
