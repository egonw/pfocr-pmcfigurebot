figure_title: Random Forest Regression Tree for the MD in the External Capsule Pathway
caption: The figure represents the recursive partitioning for the MD index in the
  external capsule pathway and the contribution of WML volume, p-tau, and Aβ38 to
  the portioning. Corresponding p values are given for each inner node. Boxplot for
  MD distribution is shown for each final group. Aβ38 = amyloid β38; MD = mean diffusivity;
  P-tau = phosphorylated tau; WML volume = white matter lesions based on hypointense
  signal abnormalities of T1-weighted 3D images.
