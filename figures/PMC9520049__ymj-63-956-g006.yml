figure_title: Inhibition of PPAR signaling pathway eliminates the effects of didymin
  pretreatment on OGD/R treated PC12 cells. (A) Western blot was performed to detect
  the protein expression of PPAR-γ and RXRA in PC12 cells. (B) MTT assay was performed
  to detect the cell viability of PC12 cells. (C and D) Flow cytometry analysis was
  performed to detect the apoptosis of PC12 cells. (E) Western blot was performed
  to detect the protein expression of Bax, c-caspase-3, and Bcl-2 in PC12 cells. *p<0.05
  vs. control group; †p<0.05 vs. OGD/R group; ‡p<0.05 vs. OGD/R+didymin group. PPAR,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; OGD/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion
