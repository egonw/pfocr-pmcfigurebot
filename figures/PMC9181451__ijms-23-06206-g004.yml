caption: (A) The chemical structure of roscovitine/Seliciclib, CR8, HQ461, and NCT02
  as MG compounds; (B) the substrate receptor-independent E3 ligase protein complex
  model for ubiquitination of the neosubstrate cyclin K. The MG compound CR8 shown
  in (A) was found through a substrate receptor-independent manner (neither CRBN nor
  DCAF15 being involved) to glue CDK12–cyclin K directly on DDB1–CUL4 E3 ligase complex
  to polyubiquitinate cyclin K. Then, the polyubiquitinated cyclin K would be degraded
  through the ubiquitination proteasome pathway. HQ461 and NCT02 may use a mechanism
  similar to CR8.
