figure_title: EGFR, B‐RAF, and HDAC inhibition of RTK/MAPK‐altered versus non‐altered
  gastric cancer PDOs
caption: ADrug response curves upon EGFR inhibition with afatinib or B‐RAF with LY3009120
  (biological replicates n = 3, data are presented as mean, SD values are shown in
  Table ).BDrug response curves upon HDAC inhibition with tacedinaline and vorinostat
  (biological replicates n = 3, data are presented as mean, SD values are shown in
  Table ).CComparison of the relative area under the curve (AUCrel) of afatinib and
  LY3009120‐treated RTK/MAPK‐altered (biological replicates n = 7) versus RTK/MAPK‐unaltered
  human PDOs (biological replicates n = 6, two‐tailed Student's t‐test). The dashed
  line “normal” represents the AUCrel of normal gastric PDOs as a reference parameter.
