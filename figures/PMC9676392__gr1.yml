caption: Hepatocyte-specific NIK deficiency ameliorates insulin sensitivity, glucose
  homeostasis and hepatic lipid accumulation in mice fed a metabolic NASH diet. (A)
  Schematic representation of non-canonical NFκB signaling. The non-canonical NFκB
  signaling pathway is activated by a specific subset of receptor and ligands, e.g.
  TWEAK and its hepatic Fn14 receptor. In the absence of a stimulus, NIK is degraded
  whereas in the presence of TWEAK the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is disrupted resulting
  in the degradation of TRAF3. Stabilization and accumulation of NIK results in phosphorylation
  of IKK1, which in turn phosphorylates p100 resulting in its partial proteasomal
  degradation to p52. Subsequently the p52/RELB NFκB complex translocates into the
  nucleus to induce target gene expression. (B) Time course of NASH model used in
  this study. Male NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO mice were fed a NASH diet for 20 weeks. With
  22 and 23 weeks of age ITT and GTT analysis was performed. Body composition was
  assessed at 25 weeks. (C) Insulin tolerance test in 22 weeks old NASH-fed NIKfl/fl
  and NIKLKO, (n = 17/14). (D) Glucose tolerance test in 23 weeks old NASH-fed NIKfl/fl
  and NIKLKONIKLKO (n = 17/12). (E) Basal random-fed insulin levels in 26 weeks old
  NASH-fed NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO (NIKLKO 3.04 ± 0.32 vs. control 6.69 ± 1.51, p ≤ 0.042)
  (n = 16/13). (F) Representative images of NASH livers of 26 weeks old NIKfl/fl and
  NIKLKO mice, scale bar 5 mm. (G) Representative images of Oil-Red- O staining of
  NASH livers of 26 weeks old NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO mice (NIKLKO 18.17 ± 2.50 vs. control
  33.79 ± 4.70, p ≤ 0.017) and corresponding quantification (n = 11/8), scale bar
  50 mm. (H) Triglyceride levels in NASH livers of 26 weeks old NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO
  mice (NIKLKO 4.23 ± 0.45 vs. control 5.89 ± 0.56, p ≤ 0.044) (n = 16/13). (I) UMAP
  visualization of annotated nuclei in NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO NASH liver samples. (J)
  GSEA analysis of NASH-fed NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO hepatocyte molecular signatures. Terms
  are sored according to their P-value. Notable terms are highlighted; P-values are
  derived from Fisher's exact test and pass Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P < 0.05.
  (K) Violin blots of lipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPARg) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma alpha
  (PPARa), the fatty acid transporter CD36 and fatty acid-binding protein (Fabp-1),
  of hepatic de novo lipogenesis acetyl-CoA carboxylase2 (Acc-2), fatty acid synthase
  (Fasn), stearoyl-CoA 1 (SCD1), and Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription
  factor 1(Srebf1) from isolated single nuclei of the hepatocyte cluster. (L) qPCR
  analysis of lipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma (PPARg) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma alpha (PPARa),
  the fatty acid transporter CD36 and fatty acid-binding protein (Fabp-1), of hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis acetyl-CoA carboxylase2 (Acc-2), fatty acid synthase (Fasn),
  stearoyl-CoA 1 (SCD1), and Srebf1 in NASH livers of 26 weeks old NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO
  mice (n = 16/13). M) qPCR analysis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck-1)
  and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6) Srebf1 in NASH livers of 26 weeks NIKfl/fl and NIKLKO
  (n = 16/13). Data are presented as mean ± SEM; ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01. Statistical
  analyses were performed using Student's t-test (A, B) and two-way ANOVA plus Fisher's
  LSD test.
