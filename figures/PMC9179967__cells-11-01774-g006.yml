caption: A proposed mechanism for what occurs during pathogenic and immune system
  interaction with the Hh signaling pathway. Pathogens become a cause to damage the
  host tissue and encourage the activation of the Hh signaling pathway. Pathogens
  play an essential role in immunity and the repair process due to key roles in. If
  Hh signaling is not regulated properly, it can cause fibrosis, immune cell imbalances,
  or T-cell receptors (TCR) selection. Pathogens such as Epsteinâ€“Barr Virus (EBV),
  Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV), and
  Helicobacter Pylori (H.P.) have been shown to directly alter Hh pathway activity.
  Once Hh signaling is activated, it can aggravate or restrain these damaging outcomes.
