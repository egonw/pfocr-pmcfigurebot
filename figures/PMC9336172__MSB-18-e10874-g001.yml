figure_title: Transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of different metabolic equilibria
  in Wnt‐low and Wnt‐high tumors
caption: 'ASelection of gene set enrichment analysis results for transcriptomic (x‐axis
  “RNA”) and proteomic (x‐axis “protein”) differences between Wnt‐high and Wnt‐low
  colorectal cancer cell lines (depmap, 39 Wnt‐high and 8 Wnt‐low cell lines for transcriptomics
  and 16 Wnt‐high and 6 Wnt‐low for proteomic) and tumors (432 Wnt‐high and 108 Wnt‐low
  for transcriptomics (TCGA), 31 Wnt‐high and 75 Wnt‐low samples for proteomic (CPTAC‐COAD)).
  Positive enrichment scores in green indicate a higher expression of the respective
  gene sets in Wnt‐high compared to Wnt‐low entities. Gene set annotation according
  to Reactome pathways and GO cellular component, an adjusted P‐value threshold of
  0.05 was applied.BDifferential transcript (x‐axis “RNA”) and protein (x‐axis “protein”)
  abundance in colorectal cancer cell lines (depmap) and tumor tissues (TCGA and CPTAC‐COAD).
  Selected genes which play a role in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial
  function and TCA cycle are displayed.C, DTranscript expression (C) and protein expression
  (D) of HK1, MRPS31, PDHA1, and GOT2 (y‐axis) compared to transcript expression of
  AXIN2 (x‐axis in the dotplot). Colors indicate CMS classification or normal colon
  tissue. Violin plots in the left panels illustrate candidate transcript and protein
  expression in the different CMS and tissue groups. Each datapoint corresponds to
  an individual tumor. Number of tumors per CMS group for (C): CMS1 ‐ 41, CMS2 ‐ 88,
  CMS3 ‐ 65, CMS4 ‐ 111, normal tissue ‐ 51; for (D): CMS1 ‐ 12, CMS2 ‐ 29, CMS3 ‐
  13, CMS4 ‐ 21.E, FTranscript expression (E) and protein expression (F) differences
  between tumor and normal colon tissue for Wnt‐high (y‐axis) and Wnt‐low (x‐axis)
  tumors. Colors indicate to which functional pathway each gene belongs: purple ‐
  glycolysis, green ‐ mitochondrial function, pink ‐ TCA cycle and mitochondrial pyruvate
  metabolism.'
