caption: 'Expression patterns of genes related to phillyrin biosynthesis. (a). Transcriptional
  profiles of DEGs related to phillyrin biosynthetic pathway. (b). Scatter plot and
  linear regression based on qRT-PCR and RNA-seq. The correlation coefficient was
  calculated using the Spearman correlation method. FsPAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
  gene; FsC3H, Coumarate 3-hydroxylase gene; Fs4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase gene; FsCCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase gene; FsCCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase gene; FsCAD,
  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene; FsDIR, dirgent protein gene; FsOMT, O-methyltransferase
  gene; FsUGT, UDP-glycosyltransferase gene. CKL: F. suspensa leaf treated with control
  solution for 0 h; M2L: F. suspensa leaf treated with 200 µM MeJA; CKF: F. suspensa
  fruit treated with control solution for 0 h; M2F: F. suspensa fruit treated with
  200 µM MeJA.'
