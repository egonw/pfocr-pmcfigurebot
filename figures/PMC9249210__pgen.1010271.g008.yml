figure_title: RNA-seq reveals that host genotype determines the consequences of a
  distant primary tumor on the lung transcriptome
caption: (A) Significant (FDR <0.25) Hallmark pathways identify transcriptomic changes
  that occur in the lungs of 6DT1 tumor-bearing Clic4 wildtype (WT) or knockout (KO)
  mice relative to the lungs of genotype-matched healthy control mice 14 days after
  implantation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) normalized enrichment scores (NES)
  are shown. Group 1, similar regulation between WT and KO; Group 2, significant for
  WT only; Group 3, significant for KO only; Group 4, opposite regulation between
  WT and KO. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify significant enrichment
  (FDR <0.25) in Hallmark pathways based on genes differentially expressed in KO vs.
  WT lungs at 14 days after primary tumor implantation. (C) Enrichment plots for the
  “TNFA signaling via NFKB” Hallmark pathway for the three comparisons shown in panels
  A and B. The ten most significant leading edge genes are listed to the right of
  each plot.
