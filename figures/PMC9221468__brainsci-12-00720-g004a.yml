caption: Fingerprint-guided drug selection and combination strategies. (A) Selumetinib-like
  drug candidates with the similar fingerprint pattern. The color bar at the top of
  the figure indicates the corresponding drug clusters and clinical status of each
  drug. Selumetinib was indicated by the yellow arrow. (B) The heatmap of IDAcomboscore
  of any two-drug combination among the Selumetinib-like drug candidates. (C) Complementary
  pattern between Selumetinib and selected drugs from DrugCluster5. Each column is
  comprised of a single drug from DrugCluster 5. The color bar at the top of the figure
  indicates the IDAcombo score. Each cell is colored according to the Pearson correlation
  between the drug responses and the eigengene of each preserved network module. The
  best predicted drug combinations with Selumetinib include JAK1/2 inhibitor AZD-1480,
  antibiotic Amphotericin B, nicotinamide salvage pathway inhibitor Daporinad, circadian
  hormone melatonin, antiviral indinavir, and anti-parasitic thiabendazole.
