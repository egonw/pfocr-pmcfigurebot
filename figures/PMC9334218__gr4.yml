caption: Differences in carcinogenic signals and the metabolic microenvironment between
  CAF phenotypes. (A) Pancancer analysis revealed the effects of CAF-associated molecules
  on carcinogenic pathways. The percentage of cancer types in which a CAF molecule
  affects the pathway, and CAF-associated molecules affecting more than five cancer
  types are shown. (B) The correlation between CAF-associated molecules and significant
  cancer signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer. (C) The mountain plot shows the
  differences in 10 classical cancer pathway scores between the two CAF phenotypes
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001). (D) Gene Ontology annotation of the differentially
  expressed genes between the two phenotypes. (E) KEGG analysis of the differentially
  expressed genes between the two phenotypes. (F) Metabolic reprogramming in the two
  CAF phenotypes (***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). (G) GSEA of the biological pathways
  involved in the two CAF phenotypes.
