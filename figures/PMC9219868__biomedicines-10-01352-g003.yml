caption: Uptake of Citrus limon L.-derived nanovesicles via macropinocytosis in colorectal
  cancer cells. HCT116 WT, HCT116 p53 (-/-), and SW480 cells were treated with labeled
  nanovesicles and/or FITC-dextran (70 kDa, macropinocytosis marker) at 37 °C. (A)
  After 24 h, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. These images were obtained
  using a fluorescence microscope. Scale bar, 20 μm. (B,C) After 6 h, relative cellular
  uptake analysis of labeled nanovesicles or FITC-dextran on these cells through flow
  cytometry. Data are means ± standard error measurement; n = 3; * p < 0.05, relative
  to HCT116 WT. p values are calculated using an unpaired t test.
