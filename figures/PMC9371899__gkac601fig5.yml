caption: Ectopic expression of RBPJ binding protein KYOT2/FHL1 results in derepression
  of a subset of Notch target genes. (A) Western blot showing the expression of GFP-tagged
  KYOT2 wildtype (WT) and of GFP-tagged RBPJ binding defective KYOT2 mutant (KYOT2
  WW/AA) in mature T (MT) cells. (B) Venn diagram representation of the overlap between
  significantly deregulated genes upon ectopic expression of GFP-tagged KYOT2 WT or
  GFP-tagged KYOT2 WW/AA mutant in MT cells. (C) Volcano plot visualizes the effects
  on gene expression upon ectopic expression of GFP-tagged KYOT2 WT versus GFP-tagged
  KYOT2 WW/AA mutant in MT cells. (D) Validation of the RNA-Seq data by qPCR. MT cells
  were infected with plasmids encoding for GFP-tagged KYOT2 WT, GFP-tagged KYOT2 WW/AA
  mutant or with the GFP empty vector control (control). Shown is the mean ± SD of
  nine independent experiments (***P < 0.001, [NS] not significant; unpaired Student's
  t-test). (E) Bar plot showing the results of the over representation analysis based
  on the KEGG database. The KEGG pathway ‘Notch signaling pathway’ is significantly
  enriched upon ectopic expression of KYOT2 WT but not of KYOT2 WW/AA mutant.
