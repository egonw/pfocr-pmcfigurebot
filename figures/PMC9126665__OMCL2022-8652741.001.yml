caption: 'Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) alleviated learning and memory deficiency and
  the pathologic changes in hippocampal CA1 region at 4 weeks after RCIR. (a) Escape
  latency changes in different groups from day 1 to day 5. (b) Swimming speed for
  reaching the hidden platform during 5 days in hidden platform trial. (c) Changes
  in the time spent in the target quadrant (%) on day 6. n = 9 in each group. (d)
  Representative images of hematoxylin-eosin staining in the hippocampal CA1 region
  (400×). Scale bar = 50 μm. n = 4 in each group. (e) The ultrastructure of neurons
  in hippocampal CA1 regions was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Scale bar
  = 1 μm. n = 3 or 4 in each group. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, the RCIR group vs. the
  sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, the NBP80 group or NBP120 group
  vs. the RCIR group; $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01, the NBP80 group vs. NBP120 group. Values
  are expressed as the mean ± SD.'
