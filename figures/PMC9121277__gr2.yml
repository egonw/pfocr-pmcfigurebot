caption: c-Jun inhibits Akt phosphorylation via Rictor downregulation and inhibition
  of Torc2 complex formation(A) Western blots of signaling molecules showing dysregulation
  in the AKT pathway by decreased p-Akt-S473 and p-Foxo-1 in c-Jun wild-type mice
  fed high-fat diet. In contrast, the c-Jun knockout samples showed that p-Akt-S473
  and p-Foxo-1 signals increased.(B, left) Western Blots of signaling molecules showing
  similar dysregulation in the AKT pathway by decreased p-AKT-S473 and p-FOXO-1 in
  c-JUN overexpressed HepG2 samples. (B, right) c-JUN downregulates the RICTOR levels
  in mTORC2 complex. Western blot analysis shows that RICTOR levels were decreased
  in c-JUN overexpressed HepG2 cells, whereas the other components of mTORC2 (MTOR,
  SIN-1) complex were the same.(C) Real-time RT-PCR analysis also showed that RICTOR
  mRNA expression was significantly reduced in c-JUN overexpressed HepG2 cells, whereas
  the expression of the components remained the same in all the samples. Data are
  represented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used to calculate statistical significance.
  Asterisk (∗) indicates statistical significance. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.(D,
  left) Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that there was no complex formation
  between SIN-1 and RICTOR. (D, right) Reverse IP-western blot was performed to show
  if c-JUN overexpression inhibited RICTOR-mTLR1-SIN1 complex formation. c-JUN expression
  inhibited the interactions between mTOR1 and SIN1.(E) (left) Immunohistochemistry
  of c-Jun wild-type and c-Jun knockout HCFD-fed mice showed increased Rictor expression
  in the knockout samples. These liver tissue sections were collected from HCFD-fed
  Alb-Cre;Junfl/fl or Alb-Cre;Junfl/fl;NS5A Tg mice. (Right) Immunoreactivity score
  was calculated based on both staining frequency and intensity. Scale bars represent
  10 μm. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used to calculate
  statistical significance. Asterisk (∗) indicates statistical significance. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.(F) Dysregulation of AKT pathway disrupts downstream pathways.
  Activation of FOXO-1 activates the gluconeogenic genes. Real-time RT-PCR analysis
  revealed that PEPCK and G6PASE are increased in c-Jun overexpressed HepG2 cells.
  Data are represented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used to calculate statistical
  significance. Asterisk (∗) indicates statistical significance. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (F, the 3rd to the left) Real-time RT-PCR analysis also showed that
  the expression of glucokinases decreased in c-Jun overexpressed HepG2 cells. Data
  are represented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used to calculate statistical
  significance. Asterisk (∗) indicates statistical significance. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (F, right) Western blot analysis showed that GSK3β was activated as
  it is hypophosphorylated in c-JUN overexpressed samples; it also showed that activation
  of GSK3β inactivates glycogen synthase, as it was hyperphosphorylated in c-Jun overexpressed
  HepG2 cells. N = 5. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used
  to calculate statistical significance. Asterisk (∗) indicates statistical significance.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
