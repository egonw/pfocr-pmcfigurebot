caption: NF-κB signaling activated following RIP140 overexpression. RPE cells were
  infected with adenovirus overexpressing RIP140 (MOI 60, 48 h) or GFP control. (A)
  The translocation of p65. (B) TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA levels were increased
  in RIP140 groups compared with control group. (C) TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 release
  levels were consistent with the mRNA levels. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. Ad-GFP
  group.
