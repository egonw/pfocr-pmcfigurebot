caption: Genomic alterations in the activin/TGFβ signaling pathway. Analyses of the
  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases using the cBioPortal (A–C), which revealed
  mostly inactivating mutations and deletions in the activin/TGFβ signaling axes (A).
  Collectively, the activin/TGFβ signaling pathway is one of the most frequently disrupted
  core signaling axes in pancreatic cancer (B). No significant correlation exists
  between patient survival and genomic alterations of the activin/TGFβ signaling axes,
  perhaps due to the dual roles of the activin/TGFβ signaling pathway in pancreatic
  cancer (C).
