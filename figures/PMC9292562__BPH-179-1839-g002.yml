caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic pathways counteract
  NAD+ consumption. NAD+biosynthetic and recycling pathways ensure a balanced intracellular
  NAD+ concentration to elicit its functions. Most of the NAD+ is recycled from intermediates
  through the salvage pathway, but it can also be synthesised de novo from different
  dietary sources. The NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide (NAM) generated
  by NAD+‐consuming enzymes (i.e., SIRTS, PARPs, SARM1, CD38/CD157). NAM is transformed
  into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by the nicotinamide phosphoribo‐syltransferase
  (NAMPT), and NMN is further converted into NAD+ by the action of nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyl‐transferases (NMNATs). NMN is also derived from dietary nicotinamide riboside
  (NR) through the action of the nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK). Dietary nicotinic
  acid (NA, niacin/vitamin B3) is transformed into NAD+ in the Preiss‐Handler pathway.
  NA is first converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) by the nicotinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), and further transformed into nicotinic acid
  adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) by NMNATs. Finally, NAAD is converted into NAD+ by the
  NAD synthase (NADS). In addition, gut microbiota offers an alternative pathway for
  synthesising NAD+ through the salvage of NA from NAM by using a microbe‐encoded
  nicotinamidase (PncA). NAD+ can also be obtained de novo from dietary tryptophan
  (Trp) through the kynurenine pathway. Trp is converted to N‐formylkynurenine (FK)
  by the rate‐limiting enzymes indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO) or the tryptophan
  2,3‐dioxygenase (TDO), and FK is finally converted to 2‐amino‐3‐carboxymuconate
  semialdehyde (ACMS). ACMS can spontaneously cyclize into quinolinic acid (QA), which
  is transformed into NAMN by the quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT) and
  enters the Preiss–Handler pathway
