caption: 'KEGG pathway analyses showed that these up-regulated genes participated
  in pathway: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, amoebiasis, chemokine signaling
  pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, rheumatoid arthritis, pathways
  in cancer, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, serotonergic synapse, TNF signaling
  pathway, chemical carcinogenesis et al. For the down-regulated genes of pathway
  analysis: chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of
  xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, retinol metabolism, tyrosine metabolism and neuroactive
  ligand-receptor interaction et al.'
