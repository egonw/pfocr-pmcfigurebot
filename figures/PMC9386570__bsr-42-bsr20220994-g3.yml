figure_title: MLN4924 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of AML
  cells
caption: (A) MLN4924 significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells, MOLM-13
  cells and the primary cells collected from two AML patients in a concentration-
  and time-dependent manner. (B–E) The numbers of apoptotic cells of THP-1 and MOLM-13
  cells significantly increased following treatment with MLN4924 (except for the 0.1
  μM dose group of MLN4924 in MOLM-13 cells, P>0.05). (F–H) MLN4924 induced cell cycle
  arrest in both THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells at the G2/M phase, and significantly increased
  the cells at G2/M phase; ***P<0.001. The means among multiple groups were compared
  by one-way ANONA and LSD-t test. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
