caption: Upregulated HER2 signalling pathway in germlines of Her2-negative breast
  cancer patients.(a) Difference of activity profiles of signalling pathways (APSPs)
  between breast cancer patients and controls. To test the significance of the difference,
  P-values were calculated by permutation (1,000,000 times). The FDR corrected P-values
  were also calculated to correct the multiple comparisons. The asterisk denotes FDR
  corrected P-value < 0.05. Most pathways activities were significantly down-regulated
  in HER2-negative breast cancer germlines (upper panel), whereas the HER2 signalling
  pathway activity was significantly up-regulated (rectangle, upper panel). However,
  only a few pathway activities were significantly altered in HER2-positive breast
  cancer patients (lower panel). (b) Correlation of APSPs between TNBC and Luminal
  B (HER2-negative). For HER2-negative breast cancer, germline pathway APSPs between
  TNBC and Luminal B (HER2-negative) subtype were strongly positively correlated.
  The black triangle represents the HER2 signalling pathway. (c) Correlation of APSP
  between ERBB2-positive and Luminal B (HER2-positive). For HER2-positive breast cancer,
  germline pathway APSPs between ERBB2-positive and Luminal B (HER2-positive) subtype
  were weakly positively correlated. (d) RNA-Seq validation of the upregulated HER2
  signalling pathway. We performed RNA-Seq on both cancerous and paracancerous tissues
  from TNBC and ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients, the expression level of HER2
  pathway signature genes in paracancerous tissue were significantly lower in the
  TNBC compared to ERBB2-positive patients, which validated the upregulated HER2 signalling
  pathway in HER2-negative breast cancer germlines. (e) The phosphoproteome validation
  the upregulated of the HER2 signalling pathway. Phosphoproteome analysis of both
  cancerous and paracancerous tissues from TNBC and ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients
  validated the upregulated HER2 signalling pathway in HER2-negative breast cancer
  germlines.
