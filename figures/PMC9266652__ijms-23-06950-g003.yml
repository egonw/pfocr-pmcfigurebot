caption: 'The ways through which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated: The activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a complicated regulatory mechanism that requires two
  triggering steps: priming and activation. TLR4 or TNF-α receptor agonists cause
  the priming phase (signal 1), which then activates the NF-B pathway by boosting
  the production of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome is then stimulated
  (activation step) by numerous triggering events, such as Aβ, ATP, ROS, bacteria,
  fungi and viruses (signal 2). Then, caspase-1 can induce maturation of IL-18 and
  IL-1.'
