figure_title: Metabolic / proteomic analysis of oxidoreductase-related pathways in
  complex-IV-deficient livers
caption: (A) Left, volcano plot of identified proteins from the Oxidoreductase (GO:0016491)
  pathway, based on proteomics performed on Cox10-/- vs. Cox10f/f livers at 8 weeks
  post-AAV administration. Significantly up or downregulated proteins are indicated
  in black. Right, GSEA of pathway components; the normalized enrichment score (NES)
  and nominal p-value are indicated. (B) Schematic of pyruvate metabolic pathways.
  Metabolites are listed in lower case, proteins are listed in upper case. Each protein
  or metabolite is color coded on whether it was detected and/or significantly changed
  between Cox10-/- and Cox10f/f livers. For mitochondrial proteins, we classified
  proteins based on whether they were significantly up or downregulated in either
  the whole cell lysate or enriched mitochondrial dataset. Rate-limiting enzymes are
  indicated in boxes. oaa, oxaloacetate. pep, phosphoenolpyruvate. ac-coa, acetyl-CoA.
  (C) Schematic of transsulfuration pathway producing α-ketobutyrate (akb) and α-hydroxybutyrate
  (ahb). Same color scheme and notation as (B). prop-coa, propionyl-CoA. (D) Schematic
  of ketone body metabolic pathway. Same color scheme and notation as (B). acac-coa,
  acetoacetyl-CoA. acac, acetoacetate. bhb, β-hydroxybutyrate. (E) Schematic of ascorbate
  metabolism. Same color scheme and notation as (B). dha, dihydroascorbate. (F) Schematic
  of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) synthesis and metabolic pathways. Same color scheme
  and notation as (B). gtp, guanosine triphosphate. 7,8-dhntp, 7,8-dihydroneopterin
  triphosphate. 6p-thbp, 6-pyrovoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin. bh2, dihydrobiopterin. q-dhbp,
  quinonoid dihydrobiopterin. Numerical data for individual panels are provided in
  .
