caption: SPX increases beige-fat specific markers in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. (A ~ D)
  SPX increases the expressions of UCP1, TBX1 and CIDEA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a
  time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. (E) The mRNA expression levels
  of UCP1, TBX1 and CIDEA in 100 nM SPX-treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after
  3 h. (F) Immunofluorescence staining shows increased expression of UCP1 upon 100
  nM SPX treatment 3 h (×600 magnification; scale bar = 50 μm). All values are represented
  as means with error bars representing S.D. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. n = 6 for
  each group
