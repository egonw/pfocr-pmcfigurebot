caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of the set of metabolites found statistically
  different between CTR + NDM-diet and NDM by 1H NMR (a) and GC-MS (b) analysis of
  urine samples taken at time T1. The plots were generated using MetaboAnalyst 5.0.
  On the X-axis, the impact of the identified metabolites on the specified pathway
  is represented, while the Y-axis indicates the level of enrichment of the designated
  pathway by the identified metabolites. The color of the circles signifies the significance
  of pathway enrichment, whereas the circle size indicates the impact on the pathway.
