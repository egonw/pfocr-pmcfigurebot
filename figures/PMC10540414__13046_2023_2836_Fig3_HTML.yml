caption: 'Chronic stress activates acetylcholinergic pathway of pulmonary epithelial
  cells with neuroendocrine functions. a. Gating strategy of flow cytometry analyses
  of ChAT+ epithelial cells and CD4+ T cells. b-c. FACS analyses of ChAT expression
  in EpCAM+ epithelial cells (b) and CD4+ T cells (c) in lungs of breast cancer model
  mice with or without chronic restraint stress for 2 weeks and their corresponding
  ChAT positive percentages. d. Immunofluorescence examinations of EpCAM and VAChT
  in lung tissues of breast cancer model mice in control group and chronic restraint
  stress group at 2 weeks. e. Immunofluorescence examinations of EpCAM and VAChT in
  lung tissues of breast cancer model mice in control group and chronic unpredictable
  stress group. f-g. Percentage (left) and fluorescence intensity (right) of EpCAM-VAChT
  colocalization in experiments as described in d and e, respectively. ns: no sense,
