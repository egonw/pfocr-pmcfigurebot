caption: HuNoV induces the expression, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
  p65. (A–F). HuNoV induced the expression and phosphorylation of p65. (G–I). VP1
  induced the expression and phosphorylation of p65. Caco2 cells were transfected
  with empty vector or full-length HuNoV cDNA (A) or VP1 (G)-expressing plasmid for
  24 h. HIEs (D) were infected with HuNoV at a genome copy of 3.5 × 107 for 24 h.
  The expressions of p65 and phosphorylated p65 were detected by WB (A,D,G) and quantified
  using Image J (B,C,E,F,H,I). (J,K,N). HuNoV induced the nuclear translocation of
  p65. (L,M,O). VP1 induced the nuclear translocation of p65. Caco2 cells were transfected
  with empty vector or full-length HuNoV cDNA (J) or VP1 (L)-expressing plasmid for
  24 h, followed by isolation of nuclear proteins from cells. The phosphorylated p65
  in nuclei was detected by WB (J,L) and quantified using Image J (K,M). Caco2 cells
  in 35 mm dishes were transfected with full-length HuNoV cDNA (N) or VP1 (O)-expressing
  plasmid, or directly stimulated with 100 HAU mL−1 SeV for 24 h. Cells were stained
  with a rabbit anti-p65 Ab, which was followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated
  goat anti-rabbit (red) as the secondary Ab. Cell nuclei (blue) were stained with
  Hoechst 33258. The phosphorylated p65 in nuclei was observed by IFA (N,O). The images
  were obtained by fluorescence microscopy using 60× objective. One representative
  experiment out of three is shown. The scale bar indicates 50 μm.
