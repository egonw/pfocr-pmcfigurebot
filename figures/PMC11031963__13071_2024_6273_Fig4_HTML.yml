caption: 'Functional enrichment of DEPPs of p3T/pho3. The X axis indicates the number
  of DEPPs. The Y-axis represents GO terms (A) and KEGG pathway maps (B). C The scatter
  plots represent KEGG pathway enrichment of the DEPPs of p3T/pho3. KEGG pathway analysis
  of DEPPs: the vertical axis shows the significantly enriched KEGG pathways and the
  horizontal axis represents the rich factors corresponding to the pathways. Rich
  factor refers to the ratio of the number of DEPPs to the number of all phosphoproteins
  in the pathway. Higher rich factors indicate greater degrees of enrichment. The
  size and color of the node represent number of phosphoproteins and P value of pathways'

  phosphorylation in response to Toxoplasma gondii infection in porcine macrophages.
