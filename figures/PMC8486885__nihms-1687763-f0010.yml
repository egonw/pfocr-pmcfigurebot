caption: L5 spinal nerve transection and ligation (1) results in SA (2) that produces
  spontaneous pain as well as sensitization of the dorsal horn local network (3).
  Stimulation of the peripheral tissues (4) produces nociceptive activity in the L4
  pathway (5), which results in evoked pain that can be partially blocked by GFS at
  the L4 level (6), whereas GFS at the L5 level (7), by eliminating SA in nociceptive
  sensory neurons, can stop spontaneous pain and block dorsal horn sensitization that
  produces excessive response to activity from the L4 pathway.
article_title: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation of injured sensory neurons in rats
  rapidly eliminates their spontaneous activity and relieves spontaneous pain.
