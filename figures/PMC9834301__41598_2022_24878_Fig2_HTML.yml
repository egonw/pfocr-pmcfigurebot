caption: Classification of metabolites. (a) Metabolite classification chart. The rectangular
  bars of different colors in the figure represent different kinds of compounds, the
  X-axis represents the number of metabolite classifications, and the Y-axis represents
  the metabolite classification entries. (b) KEGG functional analysis chart. The rectangular
  columns of different colors in the figure represent the different types of metabolic
  pathways in which the metabolites are involved, with the X-axis representing the
  number of metabolites and the Y-axis representing the specific biological function
  in the metabolic pathway in which they are involved,.
