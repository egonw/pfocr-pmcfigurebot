caption: (a) Volcano plot of Nanostring® mRNA measurement using the human Pan Cancer
  pathway panel® with highlighted Kegg WNT-pathway hits. Comparison of the CTNNB1
  mutated CCA (P4) and the APC mutated CCA samples (P1–P3) with the three WNT pathway
  wild-type CCA samples (P5–P7). (b) Heatmap showing pathway scores across indicated
  patients to illustrate clustering of pathways within samples. Orange indicates high
  pathway scores; blue indicates low scores (with undetermined/arbitrary functional
  dimension). P, patient identifier.
