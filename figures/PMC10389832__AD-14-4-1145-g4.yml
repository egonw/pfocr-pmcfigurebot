caption: The cGAS-STING pathway in neoplasms. MUS81, docetaxel, paclitaxel, arginine
  starvation, and P. acnes contribute to the increase in dsDNA in the cytoplasm. Carboplatin
  upregulates the expression of TREX1, which increases cytosolic dsDNA. SHP2 phosphorylates
  PARP1 and inhibits DNA repair, resulting in the accumulation of dsDNA. Cytosolic
  dsDNA is recognized by cGAS, and downstream signaling pathways are activated. The
  activated cGAS-STING pathway induces apoptosis and antitumor immunity, and these
  effects together lead to tumor cell death. JAK2/STAT3 and ENPP1 can inhibit the
  cGAS-STING pathway.
