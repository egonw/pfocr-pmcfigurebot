caption: 'METTL14 combined with TLR4 agonist inhibit tumor and regulate macrophage
  polarization. (A) The cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes in pMETTL14
  and normal groups of macrophages. (B) The GO enrichment analysis showed that METTL14
  was remarkably correlated with the TLR4 signaling pathway of macrophages. (C, D)
  RS09 is one of the most common TLR4 agonists. The clone formation assay indicated
  that pMETTL14+RS09 group remarkably decreased tumor cell proliferation than other
  groups (**p < 0.01). (E) pMETTL14+RS09 significantly reduced the tumor volume when
  compared with other groups (**p < 0.01). (F) TLR4 showed a remarkably positive association
  with NOS2/iNOS (r = 0.222, p = 3.27e-04) of M1 type of macrophages via TIMER database.
  (G, H) The relative proportion of M1 (iNOS) and M2 macrophages (CD163) were observed
  in tumor tissues of control, pMETTL14, RS09, and pMETTL14+RS09 groups via IF staining
  (scale bar: 50 μm; **p < 0.01).'
