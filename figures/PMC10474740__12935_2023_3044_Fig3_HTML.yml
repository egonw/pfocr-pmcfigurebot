caption: 'The signal pathway mediated by CD93 in ECs. (1) Integrin participated in
  the activation of Src and FAK, and CD93 ensured FAK activation. (2) Cell adhesion
  on laminin caused DG phosphorylation, phosphorylated DG recruits Src, integrin-induced
  Scr activation, and activated Src was induced to phosphorylate the CD93 cytoplasmic
  domain. Phosphorylated CD93 recruits and phosphorylated Cb1, phosphorylated the
  Cb1 receptor, and interacted with Crk, which interacted with DOCK180 and regulated
  downstream Rho GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA. (3) The cytoplasmic region
  of CD93 interacted with moesin and F-actin. (4) Dystroglycan interacted with dystrophin,
  and dystrophin interacted with F-actin. (5) The small GTPase Rab5c participated
  in cycling CD93 to the surface of ECs, and CD93, MMRN2, and Î²1 integrin form a complex
  in the Rab5c endosomal compartment Alt Text: There are two connected cells in the
  figure, the left side depicts the intrinsic signaling pathway, and the right side
  depicts the changes in the related protein backbone and the transport of molecules'
