caption: 'SH activated TSHR/cAMP/CREB/PAX8 signaling pathway in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells.
  The expressions of TSHR, cAMP, pCREB (ser 133), and PAX8 in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells
  were determined by Western blot with quantitative analysis. Cells were treated with
  SH for 48 h. GAPDH was used as the loading control. ** p < 0.005 vs. control. cAMP:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CREB: phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding
  protein.'
