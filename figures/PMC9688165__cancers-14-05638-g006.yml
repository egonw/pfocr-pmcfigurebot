caption: Immune infiltration and pathway enrichment associated with FASN mutations
  in melanoma. (A) Distinct infiltration abundance of 22 immunocytes of FASN mutated
  and wild-type groups evaluated with the CIBERSORT algorithm. Immunocytes highlighted
  with blue are significantly differentially infiltrated. (B) Distinct infiltration
  abundance of 31 immunocytes of FASN mutated and wild-type groups evaluated with
  Angelova et al.’s method. (C) Heatmap representation of distinct enrichment scores
  of 14 collected immune-related signatures in FASN two subgroups. Signatures highlighted
  with green are significantly differentially enriched. (D–F) Significantly enriched
  signaling pathways associated with FASN mutations. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
