caption: IBV Nsp14 protein antagonized type II interferon anti-IBV. (A) HD11 cells
  were stimulated with 100 ng/mL chIFN-γ at 30 min. chSTAT1 protein was detected using
  an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The cell nucleus was counterstained with DAPI.
  chSTAT1 nuclear accumulation was determined using confocal fluorescence microscopy.
  (B) HD11 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 or pcDNA3.1-Flag (as an
  empty vector) at 24 h after IBV infection (MOI = 5) and stimulated with chIFN-γ
  (1000 ng/mL) for 12 h. qRT-PCR was used to detect IBV N mRNA expression. (C) Western
  blotting was used to detect the IBV N protein level. Data were presented as means
  ± SD. * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, ns = not significant.
