figure_title: The PI3K-AKT pathway and major upstream effectors in the signaling network
caption: In the presence of insulin, the insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylates
  its cytosolic tyrosine kinase, which then phosphorylates IRS proteins and creates
  binding sites that recruit p85 and the catalytic subunit of PI3K to the plasma membrane.
  PI3K phosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 to produce PI(3,4,5)P3, which recruits PDK1 and AKT
  to the plasma membrane, and at the plasma membrane, AKT is phosphorylated at T308
  and S473 by PDK1/2 and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively.
  AKT signaling promotes glucose uptake and lipid, glycogen, and protein synthesis
  via the phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating AS160, GSK3Î², and tuberous sclerosis
  complex (TSC1/2) complex. In contrast, AKT signaling inhibits apoptosis and gluconeogenesis
  via the phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (BAD) and forkhead box O family
  transcription factor (FOXOs). Alternatively, negative regulators of PI3K/AKT include
  PTEN, SHIP, inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase (INPP4B), phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
  and PH-domain leucine-rich-repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP). The lipid phosphatase
  PTEN dephosphorylates the 3-phosphate of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 to generate PI(4)P
  and PI(4,5)P2. SHIP2 dephosphorylates the 5-phosphate of PI(3,4,5)P3 to yield PI(3,4)P2,
  and INPP4B dephosphorylates the 4-phosphate of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 to generate
  PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. Ultimately, a lipid phosphatase decreases the PI(3,4,5)P3
  level and inhibits the membrane localization of PDK1 and AKT, inhibiting insulin
  signaling. Moreover, the protein phosphatases PP2A and PHLPP dephosphorylate and
  inhibit AKT activity. GLUT4, glucose transporter-4; RHEB, the small GTPase Ras homolog
  enriched in the brain; Raptor, regulatory associated protein of mTOR; Rictor, the
  rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR; 4EBthe P1, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein 1; P70S6k, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase.
