caption: 'Hyperglycemia and NF-kB pathway activation. Endothelial cells exposed to
  transient hyperglycemia are characterized by the persistence of NFκB-p65 gene (RELA)
  activation, induced by DNA demethylation of the NF-κB promoter at CpGs islands through
  TET2 upregulation. Hyperglycemia activates the NF-κB-p65 gene in endothelial cells
  also by mono-methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4m1) through histone methyltransferase
  Set7 and demethylation of H3K9 on the p65 promoter by lysine-specific demethylase
  1. Hyperglycemia also influences the SUMOylation of I    B    , which is the main
  inhibitor of NF-κB dimers: when IκBα is SUMOylated, it is resistant to ubiquitin-induced
  degradation, and it inhibits NF-κB; in high glucose conditions, SUMOylation of I    B     is
  decreased, with consequent activation of the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB upregulation leads
  to increasing its gene targets, causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.
