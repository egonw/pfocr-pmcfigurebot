caption: 'Feature importance analysis. (A) Venn diagram of top 200 features for the
  model trained from scratch (blue) and the pre-trained (red) PaccMann model on the
  PDO data set. Feature importance values were averaged over all drug–PDO pairs. (B)
  Box-plots of pathway enrichment scores of the top-ranked 200 genes derived from
  feature importance values of the pre-trained model and the model trained from scratch
  for all drugs and specifically for the drug olaparib (x-axis). The y-axis denotes
  the  of the adjusted enrichment p-values. Boxes denote the 10–90% ranges of pathway
  enrichment scores. Pathway gene sets were taken from the ConsensusPathDB resource
  and were judged as significantly enriched if Fisher’s exact test resulted in a p-value
  of below 0.001, and if the pathway shared at least 10 genes with the 200 top-ranked
  genes. Sizes of samples were: all-drugs-scratch: 62 pathways; all-drugs-pre-trained:
  120; olaparib-scratch: 84; olaparib-pre-trained: 126. On top of each model pair,
  the result of an unpaired, two-sided Mann–Whitney test is displayed (****: ). (C)
  Venn diagram of top 200 features from the scratch (blue) and pre-trained (red) PaccMann
  models and the PDO data set. Feature importances were averaged over the olaparib–PDO
  pairs. (D) Bar plot of selected enrichment pathway scores ( of adjusted enrichment
  p-value, y-axis) for the 200 top-ranked genes from the scratch (light yellow) and
  pre-trained (strong yellow) PaccMann models using the feature importance values
  for all olaparib–PDO pairs; x-axis: pathways related to DNA damage repair and replication.'
