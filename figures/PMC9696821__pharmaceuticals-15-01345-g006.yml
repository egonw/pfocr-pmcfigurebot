caption: 'The effect of RG–RS on glycolysis: RG–RS strongly downregulates the expression
  of 8 genes encoding eight enzymes of the glucose metabolic pathway, significantly
  inhibits the HIF-1α signaling pathway, a master regulator of glycolysis, and activates
  antitumor monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suggesting substantial inhibition
  of the conversion of glucose into lactate (Warburg effect) in cancer that is crucial
  for proliferation and survival of tumor cells. Downregulated genes are shown in
  the green color, corresponding enzymes in the blue color: the neuron-specific enolase
  (NSE) ENO1 gene (−2562-fold change), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 PGK1 gene (−1426-fold
  change), the pyruvate kinase PKM gene (−1094-fold change), the aldolase ALDOA gene
  (−855-fold change), the triose phosphate isomerase TPI gene (−810-fold change),
  phosphofructokinase, encoded by the PFK gene (−730-fold change). HKs—hexokinases
  HK1, HK2, HK3, HK4, which are encoded by the HK1, HK2, HK3, and HK4 genes; GPI—glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase encoded by the GPI gene (+372-fold change); GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, encoded by the GAPDH gene; PGAM—phosphoglycerate mutase, encoded
  by the PGAM gene; LDH—lactate dehydrogenases; which are encoded by LDHA and LDHB
  genes; GLUT1—glucose transporting proteins encoded by the SLC2 gene; MCTs: lactate
  transporters encoded by the SLC16 gene. Tumor suppressors are shown in green, and
  oncogenes are in red. RG–RS inhibits (p > 1.3; z 1.5, ) the oncogenic Hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 (HIF-1α) and activates (p > 1.3; z—1.7, ) tumor suppressor adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways.'
