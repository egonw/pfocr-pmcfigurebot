caption: Identification of CIAPIN1-related proteins. (a) Venn diagram presents the
  number of proteins in each sample and the degree of individual overlap among CIAPIN1
  gene-silenced and scramble-treated KKU-213A and KKU-100 cells. The red circle illustrates
  the number of candidate proteins as CIAPIN1-related proteins. (b) Flowchart of selection
  CIAPIN1-related proteins and prediction of the signaling pathway in metastasis of
  CCA cells.
