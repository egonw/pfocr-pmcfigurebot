caption: Analysis of BGLS production and protein levels of individual BGLS biosynthetic
  enzymes in the BGLSg and BGLSp strains. (A and B) The yields of BGLS and dsBGLS
  produced by the BGLSg strain and the BGLSp strain. The BGLSg strain represents the
  BGLSg strain transformed with the two empty plasmids pESC-URA-USER and pESC-HIS.
  BGLSp strain represents the constructed strain shown in . Data represent the average
  and P value (two-sided Student's t test) of five biological replicates. The P value
  used to compare the BGLS yields produced by the BGLSg strain and the BGLSp strain
  is 0.00039 (indicated with ***). (C to I) Targeted proteomics of protein levels
  in the individual BGLS biosynthetic enzymes in the BGLSg and the BGLSp strains.
  The spots represent the relative level of a representative peptide for each protein
  that was normalized to the housekeeping gene PGI1 (encoding glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase). The averages and P values (two-sided Student's t test) of five biological
  replicates are shown. The P value used to compare the protein levels of ATR1 between
  the BGLSg strain and the BGLSp strain is 0.041 (indicated with *). The engineered
  strains were grown in SC-Ura-His-Glu media, and samples were taken at 48 h for metabolite
  analysis and at 24 h for targeted proteomics analysis. Exact values for BGLS and
  dsBGLS yields and protein levels are listed in Table S1.
