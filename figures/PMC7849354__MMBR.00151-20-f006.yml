caption: Regulation of chemosensory signaling by c-di-GMP. (A) 3D structures of CheR1/MapZ
  complex (PDB ID 5Y4R) (), the WspR response regulator (3BRE) (), and the transcriptional
  regulator FleQ (5EXX) () in complex with c-di-GMP, representing three different
  mechanisms by which c-di-GMP modulates pathway signaling. (B) Schematic view of
  chemosensory pathway-associated signaling by c-di-GMP. The Wsp and Chp pathways
  are involved in the synthesis of c-di-GMP that, in turn, reduces chemotaxis through
  the action of the FleQ and MapZ regulatory proteins.
