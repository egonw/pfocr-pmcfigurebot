caption: Effects of UNC0379 on endometrial cancer cells. (A) Endometrial cancer cells
  were treated with a SETD8-selective inhibitor (UNC0379) for 4 days. The IC50 of
  UNC0379 ranged between 576 nM (HEC50B) and 2540 nM (ISHIKAWA). (B) HEC50B and HEC1B
  cells were treated with various concentrations of UNC0379 for 96 h. UNC0379-treated
  cells showed decreased H4K20me1 levels and increased cleaved PARP levels in a dose-dependent
  manner. (C) UNC0379-treated cells showed prolonged sub-G1 phase and cell cycle arrest.
  (D) HEC50B and HEC1B cells were treated with 0.02% DMSO and UNC0379 for 9 days.
  UNC0379 treatment suppressed the growth of colonies (>100 cells) in a dose-dependent
  manner. (E) UNC0379-treated HEC50B and HEC1B cells were treated with either doxorubicin
  or cisplatin. Combinatorial treatment with UNC0379 and doxorubicin or cisplatin
  additively inhibited cell proliferation.
