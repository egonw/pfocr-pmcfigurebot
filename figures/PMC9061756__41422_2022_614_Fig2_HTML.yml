figure_title: The metabolomic landscape of triple-negative breast cancer
caption: 'a, b volcano plots of the 594 annotated polar metabolites (a) and 1944 lipids
  (b) profiled. Metabolites of different categories were individually color-coded.
  Right part of panel b: Log2 fold changes of the abundances of different categories
  of lipids in TNBC tumor tissues as compared with normal tissues. Log2 fold change
  value of 0 (the dashed red line) indicates the same level of lipid abundance between
  the tumor and the normal. c A pathway-based analysis of metabolomic changes between
  tumor and normal tissues. The DA score captures the average, gross changes for all
  metabolites in a pathway. A score of 1 indicates that all measured metabolites in
  the pathway increase in the tumor compared to normal tissues, and a score of −1
  indicates that all measured metabolites in a pathway decrease. Pathways with no
  less than three measured metabolites were used for DA score calculation. d SNF clustering
  of metabolomic data. e Pathway abundance (PA) scores between C1 and C2 subtypes.
  The PA score was calculated as the mean log2 fold change of the abundances of measured
  metabolites in this pathway. f Degree of overall metabolomic dysregulation among
  three metabolomic subtypes. For each metabolomic subtype, the mean log2 fold change
  of metabolites between tumor and normal tissues was calculated to represent the
  overall degree of metabolomic dysregulation.'
