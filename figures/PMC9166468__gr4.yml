caption: 'Potential role of LCN2 in pancreatic cancer.A. Biological function of LCN2
  predicted via GO enrichment analysis based on the DAVID database. A1 and B1 are
  D37774 samples, A2 and B2 are D42113 samples, and A3 and B3 are E32051 samples.
  B. LCN2 core dataset based on the use of DAVID database KEGG enrichment analysis
  to predict the regulation pathway; C. Comparison of LCN2 expression levels corresponding
  to different stages of pancreatic cancer (data source: TCGA and GTEx); D. Correlation
  between LCN2 expression and overall survival; E. Correlation between LCN2 expression
  and disease free survival; F. Differential expression of LCN2 RNA level in normal
  tissue (n = 5) and tumor tissue (n = 5); G. Immunohistochemical staining results
  showing LCN2 expression in pancreatic tumor tissues; H. Immunohistochemical staining
  analysis of LCN2 expression (*, P < 0.05; n = 5). I. Proliferation characteristics
  of AsPC-1 cell lines with LCN2 expression knockdown under GEM ±conditions (*, P < 0.05).'
