caption: In addition to the expression of PD-L1, the intrinsic expression of PD-1
  has been detected on variable numbers of tumor cells from different cancer types.
  Therefore, PD-L1 molecules of tumor cells (TCs) can bind not only to PD-1 molecules
  of immune cells (ICs), but also to PD-1 molecules of tumor cells (A). Both types
  of cellular interactions can be blocked by anti-PD-1 antibodies (B).
