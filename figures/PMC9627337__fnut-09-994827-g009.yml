caption: Proposed mechanisms of food restriction-induced synaptic depression in paraventricular
  nucleus oxytocin neurons accompanied by hyperphagia. Neuropeptide Y, either elevated
  by 24 h/50% FR or administered, induces the Y1 receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamatergic
  synaptic input on PVN OXT neurons, the pathway possibly involving NMDAR and AMPAR.
  24 h FR and 50% FR evoke this neuronal signaling and induce acute hyperphagia for
  2â€“3 days on re-feeding. Twenty four hour FR but not 50% FR also induces late hyperphagia
  on Day 9 and later.

  neurons via neuropeptide Y and Y1 receptor, inducing rebound hyperphagia, and weight
  gain.
