caption: 'Nephropathy 1st attenuated rat renal fibrosis by activating the PPARγ/Klotho
  pathway in vivo. (A) HE staining, (B) Sirius Red Staining, (C) Masson staining,
  (D–F) TGF-β1, collagen III, and α-SMA IHC staining of different kidney tissues.
  (G) Expression of PPARγ and Klotho in the UUO group and lotensin group. Nephropathy
  1st group and GW9662 (PPARγ inhibitor) group were analyzed by Western blot. ImageJ
  software was utilized for the measurement of the blot intensity of (G). Data were
  representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and *p <
  0.01 vs. control; ##p < 0.01 vs. model.'
