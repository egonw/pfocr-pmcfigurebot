caption: Hypothetical model for the evolutionary trajectory of AlmA and ALAS. Boxes
  indicate bacterial organisms and the colors of their frames and words show whether
  they utilize the C5pathway (blue) or Shemin pathway (magenta). Evolutionary events
  are represented by gray arrows and gray words. A thick open arrow with a gray frame
  indicates the symbiotic event.
