caption: 'A simplified schematic of regulators of noncanonical GLI activation. Positive
  (green) and negative (red) regulators of the GLI1 and GLI2 independent of the canonical
  Hh pathway are shown. Crosstalk between each of these modulators and GLI1/2 bypasses
  the canonical Hh ligand to PTCH to SMO cascade. Abbreviations: MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; SRF-MKL1, serum response factor-megakaryoblastic leukemia 1; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; EWS-FLI, Ewing
  Sarcoma-Friend Leukemia Integration 1; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor α; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; S6K1, S6 kinase beta-1; aPKC-ι/λ, atypical protein kinase C
  ι/λ; JMJD1A, Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylase 1A; PKA, protein kinase
