caption: 'Significantly altered metabolic pathways identified from the pair-wise comparisons
  between the three groups of C2C12 myoblasts. (A) The H2O2 group vs. the normal group;
  (B) The TMAO5 group vs. the H2O2 group. The significantly altered metabolic pathways
  were identified with pathway impact values > 0.2 and p values < 0.05, which were
  labeled with the following numbers: (1) glutathione metabolism; (2) D-glutamine
  and D-glutamate metabolism; (3) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; (4)
  purine metabolism; (5) histidine metabolism; (6) arginine and proline metabolism;
  (7) glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; (8) phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan
  biosynthesis; (9) phenylalanine metabolism; (10) beta-alanine metabolism; (11) taurine
  and hypotaurine metabolism; and (12) nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.'
