caption: Peptide 17 inhibits the interaction of YAP/TEAD1 in the renal cells. The
  effect of peptide 17 on the interaction of YAP/TEAD1 was analysed by co‐immunoprecipitation.
  (A) Inhibition of the binding of myc‐TEAD1 to affinity‐purified GFP–YAP by peptide
  17. (B) Inhibition of the binding of GFP–YAP to immunoprecipitated myc‐TEAD1 by
  Peptide 17. The experiments were repeated thrice
article_title: Peptide 17 alleviates early hypertensive renal injury by regulating
  the Hippo/YAP signalling pathway.
