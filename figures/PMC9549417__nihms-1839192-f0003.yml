figure_title: The nuclear cAMP microdomain suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in
  vivo
caption: '(A) cDNA schematics of sAC cAMP microdomain constructs. NLS, nuclear localization
  signal; NES, nuclear export signal; mito P1, mitochondrial P1 localization signal;
  LacZ, beta galactosidase encoding gene; TET on, doxycycline-activated promoter;
  HA, hemagglutinin tag.(B) Microscopy images of melanoma clones showing targeted
  localization of sAC as detected with anti-HA antibody (green). DAPI (blue) used
  to label nuclei. Anticytochrome c antibody (magenta) used to label mitochondria.
  Scale bar: 10 μm.(C) In vitro colony formation by mouse melanoma cells in Matrigel
  after 7 days ± doxycycline (DOX; 1 μg/mL). Scale bar: 100 μm.(D) Viability, based
  on relative ATP, of mouse melanoma colonies as in (C). n = 3 or more biological
  replicates; error bars, SEM; two-way ANOVA.(E) Viability of cancer cell lines following
  nuclear sAC expression as in (D). Error bars, SEM; Student’s t test, n = 3 biological
  replicates.(F) Melanoma tumor growth ± sAC microdomain expression. Switch to DOX
  containing chow at arrow/red vertical line. Data normalized to day 0 (day when mice
  changed to DOX containing chow). Reg, regular chow, gray. Dashed lines, SEM; mixed
  effect ANOVA, with Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. NLS-sAC, n = 15 animals
  per cohort; NES-sAC and mito-sAC, n = 10 animals per cohort.(G) Gross tumor images
  from (F). Scale bar: 1 cm.(H) Weight of NLS-sAC, NES-sAC, and mito-sAC tumors from
  mice fed Reg (Reg, gray bars) or DOX-containing (DOX, red bars) chow. Weight was
  normalized to regular chow (set to 1). Error bars, SEM; Student’s t test. NLS-sAC
  Reg, n = 9 animals; NLS-sAC DOX and NES-sAC, n = 10 animals per cohort; mito-sAC
  n = 5 animals per cohort.(I) Microscopic image of Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC)
  analysis. Scale bar: 100 μm.(J) Quantitation of Ki67-positive nuclei in tumor sections
  from in vivo experiment represented as a fold change over corresponding control
  cohort. Mean with data points for individual tumors are shown. NLS-sAC, n = 5 biological
  replicates, NES-sAC, n = 4 biological replicates. Error bars, SEM; Student’s t test.
