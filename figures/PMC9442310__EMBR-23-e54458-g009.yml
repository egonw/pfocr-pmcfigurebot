figure_title: miRNAs‐mediated control of MOV10 expression regulates L1 retrotransposition
  in mESCs
caption: The life cycle of L1 retrotransposition is depicted as a model. Only full‐length
  L1 elements get transcribed driven by the promoter residing in its 5'UTR sequence.
  The bicistronic L1 RNA is exported from the nucleus into the cytosol and translated
  to give rise to L1 ORF1 (ORF1p) and L1 ORF2 (ORF2p) proteins. The L1 RNA and proteins
  form a complex (L1 RNP) and are imported back into the nucleus. Endonuclease activity
  of ORF2 nicks the target DNA and using a mechanism referred to as target primed
  reverse transcription a new copy of L1 element is inserted into the genome via a
  copy past mechanism of mobilization (Beck et al, ; Goodier, ). A key regulatory
  step for retrotransposition is the import of L1RNP back into the nucleus. The canonical
  miRNA biogenesis pathway illustrates the miRNAs discovered in this study that regulate
  expression of RNA helicase Mov10 a known modulator of L1 mobility. In the absence
  of miRNAs when either DICER or DROSHA proteins are deleted in mESCs, both L1 and
  MOV10 expression are upregulated. Our data suggest that in miRNA, mutant mESCs MOV10
  induces L1 RNP aggregate formation in the cytoplasm, the impaired import consequently
  prevents L1 retrotransposition despite high L1 expression. While DDX6 was also found
  to co‐localize with the larger L1 RNP particles, the identification of molecular
  partners and biochemical activities intrinsic to the L1 RNP aggregates should unveil
  the bottle neck afforded to prevent import.
