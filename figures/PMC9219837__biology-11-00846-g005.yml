caption: A metabolic pathway for butyrolactam biosynthesis. (A) An acetyl-CoA-dependent
  pathway for butyrolactam biosynthesis from GABA. (B) In vitro analysis of Act activity
  using HPLC. Time profiles of CoA and acetyl-CoA concentrations are shown. Black
  represents negative control and red represents experimental group assay. (C) Analysis
  of butyrolactam production by the recombinant BLM-1 strain in flask cultivation
  using HPLC–MS. (D) GABA and butyrolactam productions from glucose in the engineered
  BLM strains. Data shown are mean values from three biological replicates and the
  standard deviations are presented. Significant differences were determined using
  Student’s t test (* p < 0.05).
