caption: Schematic illustration indicates the role of the microglial NF-κB, NLRP3,
  TREM2, and cGAS-STING in Alzheimer’s disease. Aβ triggers the activation of the
  NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to inflammatory cytokine release and
  promoting the pyroptotic death of neurons. TREM2 pairs with DAP12 through charge
  interactions in the transmembrane domain. Aβ and lipid proteins are the main binding
  ligands on the TREM2 receptor. Upon binding, DAP12 gets phosphorylated and recruits
  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which initiates a cascade of signaling events, including
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, that targets AKT and then activates
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), leading to inhibition of autophagy and degradation
  of Aβ. Foreign or mt DNA activates cGAS, which synthesizes the second messenger
  cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP binds to STING, leading to downstream activation of
  transcription factors for type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines that modulate
  neuroinflammation to produce an immune response against the pathogenic entity.
