caption: Manipulation of ROS toxicity in response to environmental cues. Excessive
  ROS production under extreme environment damage chloroplast-related proteins. Using
  bioengineering approaches, supplementing the nuclear D1 protein pathway into chloroplast
  and installation of xanthophyll cycle mediating reversible inter-conversion of ZEP
  and VDE could enhance photosynthetic efficiency. In addition, functional characterization
  of random mutations could help plants to adapt to undesirable environmental cues
  efficiently.
