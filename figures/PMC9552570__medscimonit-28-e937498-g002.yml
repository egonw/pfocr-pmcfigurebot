caption: LAG-3 expression by different peripheral T cell subsets in women with NP
  and early-onset PE. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of LAG-3
  by peripheral CD3+ T (A), CD4+ T (B) and CD8+ T cells (C) in NP and early-onset
  PE. Statistical comparisons were made by unpaired t test. The solid bars represent
  the medians of 34 samples, the boxes indicate the interquartile ranges, and the
  lines show the most extreme observations. Differences were considered significant
  when the P value was equal to or less than 0.05. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01. NP – normal
  pregnancy; Early-onset PE – early-onset preeclampsia. FACSDIVA V6. software (BD
  Biosciences) and GraphPad Prism software, version 7 (GraphPad) were used to create
  the figures.
