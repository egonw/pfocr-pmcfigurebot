caption: 'Effect of polyunsaturatured fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on methane
  emission. ①: The pathway of PUFA use hydrogen for the biohydrogenation (BH) reaction
  and propionic acid production associated with the decrease in methane emission,
  ②: the pathway of PUFA directly affects the methanogenic activity of the rumen microbiota
  thus reducing methane emission. ↓: Represents the decreasing effect.'

  diet of the cattle—The fatty acid associated rumen fermentation, biohydrogenation,
  and microorganism response.
