caption: 'Female-biased gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are expressed in endothelial
  cells (ECs) with strong signals of endothelial to mesenchymal transition: A, Top
  3 differential expressed genes for each EC subtype, circle size represents percentage
  of cells expressing the gene, and blue intensity represents the normalized expression
  level. B, Module score expression of GRNMAGENTA key driver (KD) genes in EC subtypes.
  C, Module score expression of GRNBLACK KD genes in EC subtypes. ACKR1 indicates
  atypical chemokine receptor 1 (Duffy blood group); DCN, decorin; DKK2, dickkopf
  WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 2; DNASE1L3, deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3; EFEMP1,
  EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1; FBLN2, fibulin 2; GLUL, glutamate-ammonia
  ligase; IGFBP3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; IGFBP5, insulin-like
  growth factor binding protein 5; PLAT, plasminogen activator, tissue type; SELE,
  selectin E; and SPP1, secreted phosphoprotein 1.'
