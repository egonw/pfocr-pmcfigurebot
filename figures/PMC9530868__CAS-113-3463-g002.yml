caption: FBXW7 mediates ubiquitination of transcription factor 7‐like 2 (TCF7L2).
  (A) Western blot analysis of TCF7L2 in HepG2 cells depleted of FBXW7 by two independent
  shRNAs. (B) Half‐life analysis of TCF7L2 protein in HepG2 cells with FBXW7 depleted.
  The cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX,100 μg/ml) for the indicated time
  periods and harvested for analysis. Protein band intensities were measured with
  ImageJ software and plotted. (C) Western blot analysis of TCF7L2 in HepG2 cells
  with exogenous overexpression of FBXW7. (D, E) FBXW7 interacts with TCF7L2. Immunoprecipitation
  of S•tag‐Flag‐TCF7L2 (D) or FBXW7‐HA (E) in HEK293T cells transfected with increasing
  amounts of corresponding plasmids. (F) Ubiquitination assay of TCF7L2 in HEK293T
  cells with or without FBXW7 overexpression. Flag‐tagged TCF7L2 was immunoprecipitated
  and blotted for HA‐ubiquitin. Cells in (F) were treated with MG132 (10 μM) for 8 h
  before sample collection
