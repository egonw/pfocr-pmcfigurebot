caption: RIG-I and ZBP1 signalling after detection of influenza A virus RNA. After
  binding to aberrant IAV RNA molecules, RIG-I induces innate immune signalling via
  the MAVS signalling cascade. MAVS activates the IRF and the NF-κB pathway which
  lead to the production of IFNβ and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. ZBP1 binds
  viral RNA in the nucleus and triggers RIPK3 mediated necrosis. Viral antagonists
  PA-X, NS1 and PB1-F2 that block certain steps of the immune signalling pathways
  are also indicated.
