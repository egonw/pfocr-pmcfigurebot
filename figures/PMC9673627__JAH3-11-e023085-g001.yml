figure_title: Differentially expressed genes among comparisons of human subjects with
  PAD progression, PAD no progression, and non‐PAD
caption: A, Gene counts differentially expressed at false discovery rate adjusted
  at P<0.05. B, Names of top 10 significantly upregulated and downregulated genes
  and their log2 fold change. C, Volcano plot highlighting differentially expressed
  genes between PAD progression and non‐PAD group at adjusted P<0.05 and log2 fold
  change >1; 99 upregulated genes on upper right quadrant (red dots) and 43 downregulated
  genes on upper left quadrant (blue dots). D, Top 10 significantly enriched pathways
  associated with differentially expressed genes (nominal P<0.05) between PAD progression
  and non‐PAD group. The size of the dot is ratio of number of genes identified as
  significantly expressed between PAD progression and non‐PAD group and number of
  genes that constitute that pathway. ACTC1 indicates actin alpha cardiac muscle 1;
  APCDD1L, adenomatosis polyposis coli down‐regulated 1‐like; BMP, bone morphogenetic
  protein; ENTPD3, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3; FC, fold change;
  FGFBP2, fibroblast growth factor‐binding protein 2; FTLP15, ferritin light chain
  pseudogene 15; GDF, growth/differentiation factor; HAS2, hyaluronan synthase 2;
  IFI44, interferon induced protein 44; IFITM10, interferon induced transmembrane
  protein 10; ITGA8, integrin subunit alpha 8; MIR503HG, MIR503 host gene; MYBPH,
  myosin binding protein H; OAS3, 2'‐5'‐oligoadenylate synthetase 3; PAD, peripheral
  artery disease; PLA2G2A, phospholipase A2 group II A; RET, ret proto‐oncogene; S100
  calcium binding protein A8; TCIM, transcriptional and immune response regulator;
  TGF, transforming growth factor; and XAF1, XIAP associated factor 1.
