caption: Intracellular labelling inducible by CD63‐APEX2. (a) Schematic drawing of
  the recombinant CD63‐APEX2 expression construct. uORF, upstream open reading frame
  to dampen translation (Ramanathan et al., ; Wethmar, ). (b) Western blot analysis
  for CD63‐APEX2 expression as revealed by Western blot analysis with an anti‐CD63
  antibody (left) and an anti‐HA antibody (right). Note that expression of CD63‐APEX2
  was lower than that of endogenous CD63 in the anti‐CD63 Western blot (left) due
  to the use of uORF. Smeared bands of both CD63‐APEX2 and endogenous CD63 might represent
  posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation that happen in the biosynthetic
  secretory pathway through the ER and Golgi apparatus. GFP, an expression control.
  Actin, a loading control. (c) Western blot analysis for proteins biotinylated by
  CD63‐APEX2 in live cells. APEX biotinylation occurs in CD63‐APEX2‐expressing cells
  after biotin‐phenol and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were added (+biotin‐phenol, +H2O2).
  Strep‐HRP, Western blotting with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated Streptavidin.
  −biotin‐phenol & +H2O2, a mock APEX biotinylation. GFP, an expression control. Actin,
  a loading control. (d) Western blot analysis of biotinylated proteins in the culture
  conditioned medium and cell lyases after a pulse in vivo biotinylation by CD63‐APEX2
  and the following 30‐h chase. A serum‐free (s.f.) medium was used to minimize endogenous
  biotinylated proteins potentially present in serum. The conditioned medium was spun
  at 15,000 × g (15k × g) to pellet down large particulates. (e) Nanoparticle tracking
  analysis of the medium of cells expressing CD63‐APEX2 or the control GFP. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
  test did not detect a noticeable difference between the two groups. (f) Multiple
  measurements of particle numbers by nanoparticle tracking analysis of the medium
  of cells expressing CD63‐APEX2 or the control GFP. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test did
  not detect a noticeable difference between the two groups. (g) Confocal immunofluorescence
  micrographs of CD63‐APEX2‐expressing cells show endosome localization of CD63‐APEX2
  as revealed by staining with an anti‐HA antibody. LAMP2, an endosome marker. Scale
  bar, 5 μm. (h) Transmission electron micrographs of CD63‐APEX2‐expressing cells
  labelled with a gold‐conjugated anti‐GFP (left, a control for background) and anti‐HA
  (right, CD63‐APEX2) antibodies. Scale bar, 1 μm. (i) Confocal immunofluorescence
  micrographs of the endosomes expressing an mCherry‐fused constitutively active form
  of Rab5 (CA Rab5‐mCherry). Signal intensities along the white line connecting two
  endosomes (yellow open arrowheads) in a deconvoluted image were quantified (right).
  LS, the lumenal space of endosomes. Scale bar, 1 μm. (j) Confocal immunofluorescence
  micrographs of CD63‐APEX2‐expressing cells after APEX biotinylation induction. Cells
  were fixed 30 min after the biotinylation induction and quenching to allow diffusion
  of biotinylated proteins. CD63‐APEX2, green (Alexa 488). Biotinylated proteins,
  red (Alexa 647‐Strep). The dotted red rectangle in the lower left micrograph was
  enlarged to the upper right. Signal intensities along the white line in the lower
  left micrograph were quantified in the right plot. LS, the lumenal space of endosomes.
  Scale bar, 5 μm
