caption: 'Assessment of BALF cortisol levels and its relation with the AAD response.
  A, BALF and serum was prepared with samples collected from SIT-treated and Rs.SIT-treated
  AAD mice (6 per group) at indicated time points. The curve shows the levels of cortisol
  in the serum and BALF. B, BALF samples were collected from Rs.SIT-treated AAD mice
  after completing the therapy. C, the heatmap shows correlation between the cortisol
  levels and the levels of AAD response-related cytokines in BALF. The numbers in
  heatmap show correlation coefficient. D, boxplots show the Il10 mRNA levels in BMDCs
  after exposure to LPS (100 ng/ml) in culture overnight. Cortisol: the presence of
  cortisol in culture (20 ng/ml). Abbreviations: BALF: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
  AAD: Airway allergic disorder. Rs: Restraint stress. SIT: Specific allergen immunotherapy.
  AAD.SIT: SIT-treated AAD mice. AAD.SIT.Rs: SIT and Rs treated AAD mice. BMDC: Bone
  marrow derived dendritic cell. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide.'
