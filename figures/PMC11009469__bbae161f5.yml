caption: Case study. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of the benchmark and candidate
  genes associated with diabetes mellitus. The bubble chart on the right illustrates
  significantly enriched pathways related to hypoglycemic pathways. The list on the
  left details the enriched genes, including those from the training set and new candidates
  predicted by KDGene. (B) Visualization of links of known and predicted genes for
  diabetes mellitus on the PPI network. (C) For diabetes mellitus, the observed number
  of network links is significantly larger than the random control (P = 2.05E-88,
  binomial test). (D) Visualization of links of known and predicted genes for Atrophic
  Gastritis on the PPI network. (E) The observed number of network links is significantly
  larger than the random control (P = 3.16E-30, binomial test). The statistical significance
  of the P-values for the predicted genes in both representative diseases suggests
  that the interactions observed on the PPI network are not due to random chance and
  may indicate biologically meaningful relationships relevant to the pathophysiology
  of the conditions.
