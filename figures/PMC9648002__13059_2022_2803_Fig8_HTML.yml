caption: Summary of somatic SVs detected in PacBio long-read sequencing data and assembled
  contigs. A Counts of somatic SVs with supports from two or more calling methods
  in tumor sample (HCC1395) using PacBio long reads and assembled contigs on HCC1395BL_v1.0
  as compared to GRCh38 references. B Mapping 744 GRCh38-based somatic SVs that were
  supported by three or more calling methods onto HCC1395BL_v1.0, 531 SVs were mapped
  with matched SVs on HCC1395BL_v1.0, and 129 SVs were mapped but without matching
  SVs, whereas 84 SVs were considered “unmapped” on HCC1395BL_v1.0. C KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis for 86 genes overlapped with 91 novel SVs. Shown here are the
  top 10 enriched pathways with “odds ratio” (zScore) and log (p-value) on the y-axis.
  The numeric labels are the enriched gene counts versus the total genes in each pathway.
  D Repeat annotation for the sequences of 72 deletions from 91 SVs that overlapped
  86 gene regions using RepeatMasker showed that 32 deletions overlapped 10 classes
  of repeat families, among them 17 SINE/Alu, 8 simple repeats, and 3 retroposon/SVA
