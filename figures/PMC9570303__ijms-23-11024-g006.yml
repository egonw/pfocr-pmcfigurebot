caption: CRC gene expression profiling and pathway enrichment analysis. (a) Venn diagram
  to show the specific and shared DEGs and enriched pathways in the case of CRC with
  different types of samples. (b) Venn diagram to show the specific and shared DEGs
  and common DEGs with myricetin targets. (c) Pathway-level linkage of myricetin and
  the CRC. The degree of yellow color in (b) and (c) represents the less (low degree)
  to higher (higher degree) number of overlapping genes.
