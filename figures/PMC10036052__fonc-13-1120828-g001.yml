caption: 'Schematic representation of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and PROTACs.
  (A) A PROTAC, which has an E3 ligase ligand at one end and a protein ligand at the
  other end, is connected by a linker in the middle to form a ternary complex: target
  protein–PROTAC–E3. Eventually, the target protein is degraded by the 26S proteasome,
  and the PROTAC is retained. (B) Monoubiquitination. (C) Multiubiquitination. (D)
  Polyubiquitination. (E) DUB-mediated deubiquitination (which disconnects target
  proteins from Ub). (F) Protein degradation products.'
