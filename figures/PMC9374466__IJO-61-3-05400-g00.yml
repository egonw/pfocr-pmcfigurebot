caption: Long non-coding RNA CASC11 expression is upregulated in PCa. (A) Differential
  expression profile of non-coding CASC gene family members in PCa samples and normal
  tissues. (B) Expression of CASC11 in prostate tumor and normal tissue samples with
  different Gleason scores in TCGA dataset. (C and D) Expression of CASC11 in prostate
  tumor and normal tissues in GSE46602 and GSE55945 datasets. (E) Expression of CASC11
  in 66 paired prostate tumor and normal tissue samples. (F) Expression levels of
  CASC11 in PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, DU145 and 22Rv1) and a prostate epithelial
  cell line (RWPE-1). (G) Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of CASC11 in
  LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei, and 18S was used as a
  positive control for cytoplasmic staining. Scale bar, 50 Âµm. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. normal or as indicated. CASC11, cancer susceptibility
  candidate 11; PCa, prostate cancer; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
