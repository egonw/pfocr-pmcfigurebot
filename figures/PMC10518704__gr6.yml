caption: Summary of the impact of high PPC on female reproductionHigh PPC induces
  an increase of trehalose level in hemolymph and glycogen content in the fat body
  by activating the gluconeogenesis pathway and inhibiting the IIS-AKT pathway, subsequently
  increasing absorption of trehalose and glycogen accumulation in the ovary. Simultaneously,
  genes related to ovarian development are downregulated, ultimately leading to female
  reproductive disorders. Insulin effectively rescues reproductive damage by reducing
  the blood sugar level. Previous studies indicate that high PPC inhibits the synthesis
  and absorption of Vg, resulting in reproductive damage. The blue dotted line box
  represents our research results and the gray dotted line box represents the work
  of Wang et al. The flat heads denote an inhibitory effect, while arrows signify
  a promotional effect.
