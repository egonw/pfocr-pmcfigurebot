figure_title: IL-6-specific up-regulation of LCN2 is dependent on NF-κB activation
  in human CRC cells
caption: (A) After stimulation with 50 ng/ml IL-6 for the indicated time, cytosolic
  and nuclear extracts of DLD-1 cells were prepared and used to determine the translocation
  of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Actin and lamin B were used as loading controls.
  (B) After transfection with LCN2 siRNA, DLD-1 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml
  IL-6. Then the level of LCN2 in the cytosol and p65 in the nucleus were analyzed
  by Western blotting. Actin and lamin B were used as loading controls. (C) The cells
  were stimulated after transfection with p65 siRNA, then the levels of LCN2 and p65
  were analyzed by Western blotting (upper panel). Cells were stimulated with IL-6
  after pretreatment with PT and BAY11-7082 (NF-κB-specific inhibitor). Then, the
  levels of LCN2 and p65 were detected using Western blot analysis (lower panel).
  Actin was used as a loading control. All images are representatives from at least
  three independent experiments.
