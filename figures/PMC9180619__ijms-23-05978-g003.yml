caption: SHPK overexpression and cell functional studies. (A) SHPK mRNA expression
  in T98G, U87, and U118 cells after SHPK overexpression and relative controls. (B)
  Immunofluorescence staining of SHPK protein (red) in T98G, U87, and U118 cells overexpressing
  SHPK and relative controls (vector alone, green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI
  (blue). (C) Viability of T98G, U87, and U118 cells after SHPK overexpression and
  their controls at the time of seeding (T0) and after 24 h (T1), 48 h (T2), and 72
  h (T3). A450 absorbance values relative to T0 are shown in the vertical axis (y).
  (D) Wound healing assay of T98G, U87, and U118 cells after SHPK overexpression and
  relative controls. (E) Transwell migration assay of T98G, U87, and U118 cells after
  SHPK overexpression and relative controls. Cells that crossed the membrane were
  counted in five visual fields as migrated cells. (F) differences in the metabolic
  phenotype of T98G, U118, and U87 cells under both basal and stress conditions in
  the presence or absence of SHPK overexpression. Each measure of OCR and ECAR was
  calculated by averaging the measurements made in triplicate (SD shown) for three
  different measurements (9 total measurements) in both the baseline and stressed
  states. p-values were calculated using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test with GraphPad
  Prism 9.3.1. **** p < 0.0001; *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05.
