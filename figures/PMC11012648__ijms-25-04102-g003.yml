caption: 'Therapeutic targets of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt ligands
  are activated by porcupine-mediated lipid modification and bind to Frizzled receptors
  and LRP co-receptors. R-spondin binding to Lgr receptors enhances Wnt signaling
  by sequestering ZNRF3 and RNF43 to stabilize the Wnt/Fzd interaction. Activation
  of the Fzd/LRP receptor complex leads to the recruitment and activation of Disheveled.
  In turn, Disheveled inhibits the β-catenin destruction complex. β-catenin translocates
  to the nucleus, where it displaces TBL1-containing corepressor complexes from TCF/LEF
  transcription factors to allow the transcription of target genes. CBP is recruited
  to the promoter regions of Wnt target genes. PORCN: Porcupine, Wnt: wingless-related
  integration site, LRP: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, ZNRF3:
  zinc and ring finger 3, RNF43: ring finger protein 43, Lgr: leucine-rich repeat-containing
  G protein-coupled receptor, RSPO: R-spondin, GSK-3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β,
  Axin: axis inhibition protein, APC: adenomatous polyposis coli, CK1α: casein kinase
  1 α, TBL1: transducin beta-like 1, TCF/LEF: T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor,
  CBP: CREB-binding protein.'
