caption: Analysis of RGC apoptosis in the RGC layer through the TUNEL assay in the
  fourth week after rAION induction. (A) Representative images of TUNEL staining.
  (B) Quantification of apoptotic cells per HPF. The number of TUNEL-positive cells
  in the rAION induction and GCSF plus TAF9 siRNA-treated group significantly increased
  by threefold compared to that in the rAION induction and GCSF plus scrambled siRNA-treated
  group (* p < 0.05, n = 6; scale bar = 50 Î¼m).
