figure_title: The combination of 2-DG and sorafenib is effective against NRASQ61-mutated
  melanomas
caption: 'a Immunoblot showing the effects of 2-DG on RAS pathway activation and PFKFB2
  phosphorylation compared to GS in NRASQ61 mutant melanoma cells. Numbers show the
  fold induction of the indicated ratio (n = 3 independent biological experiments).
  b Cell death detection by flow cytometry analysis in NRASQ61 mutant melanoma cells
  stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin-V-GFP. The cells were treated for
  4 h with sorafenib in the presence or absence of glucose (GS) and upon the addition
  of 2-DG (30 mM) and 10 mM glucose. A representative experiment is shown (n = 3 independent
  biological experiments). c Western blot showing the expression and localization
  of the indicated cell death-related proteins in NRASQ61-mutated cell lines after
  GS in the presence of sorafenib and/or 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG). Lamin A/C and GAPDH
  are shown as loading and subcellular localization markers (n = 3). d Histograms
  showing cell death detection by flow cytometry analysis in NRASQ61 mutant melanoma
  cells stained with Annexin-V-GFP after the indicated treatments: Pan-caspase inhibitor
  zVAD-FMK and necrostatin 1 (n = 2 biologically independent experiments). e In vivo
  tumor growth assays showing the effect of the combination of sorafenib and 2-DG
  in NRASQ61- and BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells. n = 5 mice per group of treatment
  in three different cells lines, including patient-derived cells (MMLN9); p value,
  one-way ANOVA. Representative immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence images
  against the indicated antibodies are shown. Bars represent 400 µm and 100 µm for
  the magnification of the graph inset. GS glucose starvation, Sor. Sorafenib, N necrosis.'
