figure_title: A model for the roles of GOMAFU in suppressing neuronal IFN responses
  and dysregulation of the GOMAFU pathway in SCZ pathogenesis
caption: GOMAFU is an intrinsic suppressor of IFN signaling pathways in human neural
  progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons of the brain, which governs basal level expression
  of IFN response genes. Diverse dysregulation of GOMAFU and its targets in SCZ brain
  regions may alter neuronal responses to environmental risk factors that trigger
  neuroinflammation, which increases SCZ vulnerability. Exposure to pathological increase
  of IFN-Î³, such as maternal and/or postnatal virus infection and stress, induces
  decline of GOMAFU in neuronal cells, which de-represses genes selectively enriched
  in the stress and immune response pathways. These genes form a molecular network
  affected in the SCZ brain, which contributes to SCZ pathogenesis.
