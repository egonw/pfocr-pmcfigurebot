caption: 'Endothelial cell (EC) sprouting behavior is markedly reduced by the tubulin-modifying
  drug, paclitaxel. A: ECs were seeded as single cells for 24 hours in the absence
  or presence of paclitaxel at 100 nmol/L or the drug combination FIST, which stimulates
  EC lumen formation. FIST consists of forskolin (10 μmol/L), IBMX (100 μmol/L), SB239063
  (10 μmol/L), and tubacin (10 μmol/L). Arrows indicate sprouting EC tubes with evident
  lumens; arrowheads indicate EC rings with circular lumens. B: EC aggregates were
  treated with the indicated drugs, including the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2
  (5 μmol/L), the Notch pathway inhibitor, DAPT (5 μmol/L), or both and then in the
  presence or absence of paclitaxel (100 nmol/L). After 24 hours, cultures were fixed,
  stained, and imaged. White arrowhead indicates aggregate with an open central lumen;
  black arrowhead indicates aggregate with no sprouts or lumen. Scale bars: 100 μm
  (A and B, left four panels); 200 μm (B, right four panels).'
