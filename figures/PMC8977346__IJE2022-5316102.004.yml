caption: ASPM regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ATC cells. (a) Wnt3a
  was detected by TOPFlash assay, and several representative targets of Wnt signaling
  (CCND1, c-Jun, MMP7, and c-MYC) were evaluated using western blotting. (b) The expression
  of β-catenin in ATC cells after co-transfection with sh-ASPM and human β-catenin
  plasmids. (c–f) Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were re-evaluated after
  the rescue of β-catenin. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
