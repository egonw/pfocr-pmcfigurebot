caption: In vitro study amentoflavone inhibits EMT, migration, and invasion ability
  in CRC cells by increasing miR-16 levels. (A) qPCR validation of miR-16 expression
  in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle. (B,C, control
  group) qPCR and WB validation of EMT marker mRNA (B) and protein (C) expression
  in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected
  with inhibitor-NC or miR-16 inhibitor. (D,E) Transwell assays were performed to
  examine the potential migration (D) and invasion (E) of HCT116 and SW480 cells treated
  with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with inhibitor-NC or miR-16
  inhibitor (crystal violet staining), where the scale bar =50 µm. (A,B,D,E) N=3,
  mean ± SEM, *P<0.05, by Student’s t-test. Data represents similar results from 2
  independent experiments. EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; CRC, colorectal
  cancer; qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; NC, negative control; SEM,
  structural equation modeling.
