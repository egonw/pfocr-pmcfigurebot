caption: MiR-199a-3p/5p is downregulated in NSCLC tissues and human cell lines, which
  associated with tumor survival. (A) miR-199a-3p expression in NSCLC tissues detected
  by qRT-PCR. (B) miR-199a-5p expression in NSCLC tissues detected by qRT-PCR. (C
  and D) The expression levels of miR-199a-3p/5p in the six human NSCLC cell lines.
  BEAS-2B cells were used for the normal control comparison. (E) The effect of miR-199a-3p
  expression levels on the Kaplan-Meier curve for TCGA database in lung cancer patients.
  (F) The effect of miR-199a-5p expression levels on the Kaplan-Meier curve for TCGA
  database in lung cancer patients. (G) The combined effect of miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p
  expression levels on the Kaplan-Meier curve for TCGA database in lung cancer patients.
  (H) The biological pathway of miR-199a-3p/5p was analyzed using FunRich 3.1. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
