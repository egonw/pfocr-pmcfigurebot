caption: Regulatory phytochemicals of TC in managing ALD. (A) Venn-diagram showing
  the distribution of protein targets of TC. (B) Alcoholic Liver Disease-specific
  Protein Target (ALD-PT) network comprising of 51 nodes and 63 edges, consisting
  the information of 11 ALD proteins (diamond nodes) and their 40 regulatory (pink
  circular nodes) PCs of TC. Among the 40 PCs, yellow highlighted nodes represent
  PACs. (C) Protein-disease association network, highlighting the regulatory role
  of 40 PCs via their 453 protein targets (pink circular nodes) toward 24 liver-associated
  disease terms (green triangular nodes). The size of the nodes varies according to
  their degree value in the network. The edge color of the protein-disease pair varies
  as per the DisgeNET score. (D) Pathway association of the 453 protein targets of
  40 PCs of ALD-PT network, where X-axis represent the Human-pathway and Y-axis represent
  the â€“log10 (P value). For the display only 15 highly enriched pathways based on
  P-value were selected, highlighting the major role of PCs in regulating cancer and
  signaling processes.
