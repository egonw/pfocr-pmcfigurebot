caption: The HH pathway in gastrointestinal cancers and TME. The role of HH signaling
  in drug resistance of gastrointestinal cancers and CAFs is summarized. Activated
  HH signaling is found in CAFs with elevated expression of αSMA and periostin. NDRG1
  reduces CAF-mediated cell migration and the CAFs’ activation through inhibition
  of HH signaling. TME-derived HIF1α and CAF-derived TGFβ2, Gal1, TNFα, and IL-1β
  may activate HH signaling in tumor cells to induce drug resistance. Hedgehog (HH);
  tumor microenvironment (TME); cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs); alpha smooth
  muscle actin (αSMA); N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1); hypoxia inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α); transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2); glycan-binding protein
  galectin-1 (Gal1); tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα); interleukin-1β (IL-1β).
