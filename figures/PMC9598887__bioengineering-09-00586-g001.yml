caption: '(a) Metabolic pathway of P(3HB) biosynthesis from CO2 by hydrogen-oxidizing
  bacterium R. eutropha. (b) Chart depicting the explosive range for hydrogen gas.
  (c) Experimental setup of the newly developed culture system with a continuous supply
  of non-combustible gas mixture (H2: O2: CO2: N2 = 3.8: 7.3: 13.0: 75.9). The non-combustible
  gas mixture was continuously supplied by mixing the hydrogen-containing gas mixture
  (gas cylinder) and air (air compressor) at a volumetric ratio of 2:1 into a 250-mL
  jar fermentor at 1â€“15 mL/min. 1, Hydrogen-containing gas cylinder (H2: CO2: N2 =
  5.8: 19.9: 74.3); 2, air compressor; 3, mass flow controller; 4, 250-mL jar fermentor;
  5, 1 N NaOH and 1 N HCl reservoirs for pH adjustment.'
