caption: 'MLT suppressed the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathway in LPS-stimulated
  HMGECs. The HMGECs were treated with MLT for 48 hours followed by LPS for 1 hour.
  (A) Representative protein bands of p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK p-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK,
  p-p65 NF-κB, and p65 NF-κB. (B–E) Quantitative intensity of p-ERK/ERK (B), p-JNK/JNK
  (C), p-p38/p38 MAPK (D), and p-p65/p65 NF-κB (E). n = 4. *Significantly different
  from control, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. #Significantly different from LPS group,
  #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
