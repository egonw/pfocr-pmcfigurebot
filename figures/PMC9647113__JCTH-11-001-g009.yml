figure_title: Proposed model for the regulation of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway
  by GLT25D1 in hepatic stellate cells
caption: Upregulation of GLT25D1 affected the glycosylation of proteins including
  collagen and Cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1), which enhanced the
  interaction with responding receptors or TGF-β1 that synergistically activated the
  TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling pathway. There is currently no evidence that proteins (TGFβRI,
  TGFβRII, Smad2/3/4) from the TGF-β1/SMAD pathway were glycosylated by GLT25D1. TGFβRs
  include type I receptor and type II receptor of TGF-β1. GLT25D1 is up-regulated
  in human cirrhotic liver and expressed in nonparenchymal cells. Down-regulation
  of GLT25D1 attenuated collagen deposition in BDL-induced liver fibrosis. GLT25D1
  affected activation of primary HSCs and LX-2 cells via the TGF-β1/SMAD3 pathway.
  GLT25D1 regulated glycosylation in type I collagen and influenced collagen properties.
