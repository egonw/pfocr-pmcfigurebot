caption: Insulin and IGF1 activate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, resulting in protein
  synthesis and hypertrophy. On the other hand, disuse condition leads to a blockage
  of the AKT signaling pathway. The arrows indicates an increase of protein synthesis
  in normal condition or a reduction of protein synthesis during disuse.
