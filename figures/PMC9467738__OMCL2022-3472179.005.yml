caption: Enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis in subtype 1 patients.
  (a) Transcriptome-based GSEA, node size indicates the number of genes in the current
  pathway and node color indicates the significance of the results. (b) Proteome-based
  GSVA, purple represents HCC and green represents hepatitis B, red indicates that
  the pathway is activated, and blue indicates that it is suppressed. The Venn plot
  of (c) activated and (d) suppressed KEGG pathways in GSEA and GSVA. (e) Immune cell
  infiltration in HCC and hepatitis B, green indicates hepatitis B and purple indicates
  HCC. ∗ is p value < 0.05, ∗∗ is p value < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ is p value < 0.001. Correlation
  analysis of immune cells in (f) HCC and (g) hepatitis B.

  Carcinoma Based on Mutation Accumulation for the Early Diagnosis and Potential Drug
  Treatment of HBV-HCC.
