caption: 'TLR signaling pathways. TLR pathways are divided into two types: those mediated
  by MyD88 adaptor proteins and those mediated by MyD88-independent adaptor proteins,
  also known as the TRIF pathway. All TLRs activate the MyD88-dependent pathway except
  for TLR3, which exclusively signals through TRIF. Activated TLRs attract MyD88,
  which subsequently starts targets further down the chain. NF-κB, IRF3 and IRF7,
  as well as transcription factor activation and the generation of inflammatory cytokines,
  are all activated by TLR4, which leads to inflammation, immunological modulation,
  survival, proliferation, and cancer via the TRIF and MyD88 pathways. IRAK, IL-1R-associated
  kinase; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappaB; TIRAP, TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β,
  MyD88 adaptor-like protein; TLR, Toll-like receptors; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α receptor-associated factor 6; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  IFN-β.'
