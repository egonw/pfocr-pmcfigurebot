caption: 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) suppresses tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced
  autophagy in immortalized Fischer rat Schwann cells 1 (IFRS1). (a–f) IFRS1 cells
  treated with 50 μM tBHP for 3 h in the presence or absence of pretreated 10 μM DHA
  were analyzed by Western blotting. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three
  experiments. *: p < 0.05 and **: p < 0.01 compared with the control; #: p < 0.05
  and ##: p < 0.01 compared with the 50 μM tBHP control. LC3: microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ULK1: UNC51-like kinase.'
