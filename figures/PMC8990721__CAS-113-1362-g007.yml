caption: 'Lung adenocarcinoma–derived von Willebrand factor (vWF) positively regulated
  phosphorylase kinase subunit G1 (PHKG1) through the PI3K/AKT pathway. A, Coexpression
  correlation analysis of vWF and PHKG1 in lung adenocarcinoma based on The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. B, C, qRT‐PCR and Western blot analysis of vWF and
  PHKG1 protein or mRNA expression in solid tumors in a mouse spontaneous metastasis
  model. D, E, qRT‐PCR and Western blot analysis of vWF and PHKG1 in protein or mRNA
  levels in 95D cells transfected with vWF siRNA or vWF pcDNA. F, G, Western blot
  analysis with antibodies directed against PI3K, P‐PI3K, AKT, P‐AKT, and PHKG1 was
  performed. H, Glycogen stores were visualized by PAS staining in 95D cells transfected
  with vWF siRNA or vWF pcDNA. Scale bar: 100 μm. I, J, Glycogen assay and lactate
  assay on 95D cells transfected with vWF siRNA or vWF pvDNA. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001'
