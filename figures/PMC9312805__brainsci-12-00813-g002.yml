caption: 'Inhibition of astrocyte process formation after TBCB was silenced. (A,B)
  Immunofluorescence shows that the positive transfection efficiency with TBCB siRNA
  with green fluorescence was 80%. (C,D) In lower magnification images, immunofluorescence
  shows a change in TBCB expression at nascent astrocyte processes (arrows) after
  TBCB silencing. (E–H) Immunofluorescence shows changes in the expression of TBCB
  (green signal) and α-tubulin (red signal) in astrocytes in both the control group
  (E,G) and the TBCB-silenced group (F,H). Panels G and H are magnified images from
  the square area of Panels E and F. (I) The number of astrocyte processes and mean
  grey value (MGV) of TBCB and MT in astrocyte processes (MGV = integrated density/area)
  after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of acute foetal alcohol exposure. (J) Western blot and
  (K) RT–PCR analyses of the protein and mRNA levels of TBCB and α-tubulin after TBCB
  was silenced (n = 6, p < 0.05). NC: negative control group; siTBCB: TBCB siRNA group.
  **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001.'
