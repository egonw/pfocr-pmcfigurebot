caption: Comparison between predicted and RNA-seq expression. The lower two rows provide
  examples of tiles with low and high predicted expression for selected genes. Each
  panel in the lower two rows contains 16 example images, divided by black lines.
  Each row in the subplots contains four tiles by the same patient, with four rows
  corresponding to four different patients. The edge length of each of the 16 tiles
  is 110.88 µm. (a) Scatter plot between CNN prediction and RNA-seq estimates of expression
  for the best predicted gene BRICD5 with a Spearman correlation of 0.749. (b) Examples
  of tiles with low predicted BRICD5 expression. (c) Example tiles with high predicted
  expression. (d–f) Corresponding plots for GNMT with a Spearman correlation of 0.501.
  GNMT is part of the androgen signalling pathway. (g–i) The respective relationship
  and examples for the DNA repair gene CDK12, with a Spearman correlation of 0.577.
  The corresponding plots for the CCP score are displayed in (j–l), with higher expression
  being associated with higher proliferation, ISUP grade and poorer prognosis
