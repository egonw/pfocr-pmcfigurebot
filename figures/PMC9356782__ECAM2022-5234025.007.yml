caption: 'Assessment of the efficacy of RBP in UC. (a) Flow diagram of experiment
  arrangement. (b) The change of body mass in rats during the treatment (n = 6). (c)
  The morphological appearance of the colorectum. (d) The length of the colorectum
  (n = 6). (e) Typical histologically morphological changes in Control, Model, and
  treated UC rats. The red arrows represent neutrophil and macrophage infiltration,
  green arrows represent edema, yellow arrows represent residual heterosexual intestinal
  glands, and black arrows represent inflammatory cell infiltration. Compared with
  the control group: #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01; Compared with the model group: ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01. n = 6 for each group.'
