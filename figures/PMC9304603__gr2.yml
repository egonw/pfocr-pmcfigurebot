caption: 'Downregulation of the interferon signaling pathway in SCD. (a) Fold change
  (FC) histograms for up (positive number) or down-regulated (negative number) protein-coding
  genes (blue) and isoforms (yellow) in SCD. Abs: absolute. (b) PCA plot on differentially
  expressed genes and isoforms of SCD. (c) Volcano plot displaying the statistical
  significance (P-value) versus magnitude of change (fold change) of protein-coding
  genes and transcripts in SCD compared with NC. DE genes/isoforms with |log2(FC)|
  > 1 are labeled. (d) Pathway enrichment analysis for genes that were differentially
  expressed at gene or isoform level in SCD. The top 5 enriched pathways are shown.
  Blue and yellow represent down and up-regulated pathways, respectively. The red
  dashed line indicates the significance threshold (FDR = 0.05). (e) IPA canonical
  pathway for interferon signaling. Green shading represents down-regulated genes.
  (f) GSEA in type I interferon signaling pathways across disorders. Barplot shows
  the normalized enrichment score (NES) and significance. A positive/negative NES
  value indicates up/down-regulation of this gene set in disease compared with NC.
  ***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01. (g) Fold changes of ISG genes (IFI44L, IFI27, RSAD2,
  SIGLEC1, IFIT1, and IS15) defining the IFN signature at gene and isoform level across
  disorders. (h) ISG score of each group (NC = 82, SCD = 44, MCI = 51, AD = 25) based
  on the mean expression of these six signature genes. Error bar indicates 95% confidence
  interval of ISG score. P values were determined with the two-tailed t-test. ***,
  P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05; ·, P < 0.1; ns., P > 0.1. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
