caption: 'Differential amyloid plaque accumulation in the central auditory pathway
  of 5xFAD mice compared to APP/PS1 mice correlates temporally with the onset of central
  gain. Coronal sections from 13 M wild-type, 3 M 5xFAD, 6 M 5xFAD, 12 M 5xFAD, and
  13 M APP/PS1 mice harboring important auditory nuclei were stained with anti-amyloid
  antibody (A–C, 5× images, yellow) and counterstained with Neurotrace to reveal nuclei
  (A–C, green). (A) Sections containing hippocampal subiculum (1, Sub), CA1 region
  (2), auditory cortex (3, AC) and the medial geniculate body (4, MGB) are compared.
  Regions are indicated with white outlines. (B) Sections containing the inferior
  colliculus (5, IC) the superior olivary complex (6, SOC) and the medial nucleus
  of the trapezoid body (7, MNTB) are compared. (C) Sections containing the cochlear
  nucleus (8, CN) are compared. All scale bars are 1,000 microns. (D) The percent
  area for each region that is covered with plaque is displayed (n = 6). Data are
  presented by modified box plots with jitter points represent individual animals.
  Asterisks denote the significant differences between genotypes: no significance
  (n.s.). p ≥ 0.05; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001.'
