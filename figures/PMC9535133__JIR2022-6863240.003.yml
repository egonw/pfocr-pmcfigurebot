caption: ATXN2 activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. (a) Heatmap of altered genes when ATXN2
  was downregulated in SGC7901/5-FU cells. (b) KEGG pathway analysis of changed pathways
  when ATXN2 was downregulated in SGC7901/5-FU cells. (c) Phosphorylation levels of
  PI3K and AKT were measured by Western blot. (d) Protein levels of p-AKT and AKT
  in SGC7901 cells overexpressing ATXN2 or treated with an AKT inhibitor. (e) Apoptosis
  rates of SGC7901 cells overexpressing ATXN2 or treated with an AKT inhibitor were
  detected after treatment with 5-FU (10 μg/mL). (f) Downregulated genes enriched
  in the PI3K/AKT pathway. (g) Protein level of BCL2L1 in SGC7901 cells and SGC7901/5-FU
  cells. (h) Protein level of BCL2L1 in SGC7901 cells overexpressing ATXN2 and/or
  silencing BCL2L1. (i) Apoptosis rates of SGC7901 cells overexpressing ATXN2 or (and)
  silencing BCL2L1 were detected after treatment with 5-FU (10 μg/mL). (j) The correlation
  between ATXN2, AKT, and BCL2L1 expression in the TCIA and GEPIA databases. ∗∗P <
