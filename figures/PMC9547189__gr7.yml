caption: 'The upregulation of miR21 reduced the dephosphorylation of LATS1Thr1079
  and YAPSer127 by suppressing PP2A Bβ in vivoWestern blotting of (A) PP2A Bβ, p-LATS1
  (Thr1079), LATS1, p-YAP (Ser127), and YAP in placentae at E18.5 and (B) cytoplasmic
  and nuclear YAP in placentae at E18.5 (n = 4 placentae from four dams in the agomir-NC,
  agomir-miR21, and control groups; one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test; ns, nonsignificant). (C) IF staining of CK7(red) and YAP (green) in placentae
  of the agomir-NC (upper) or agomir-miR21 group (lower) at E18.5. Nuclei were counterstained
  by DAPI (blue); scale bar, 25 μm; two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test, ∗p < 0.05. (D) RT-qPCR of ctgf, amotl2, and ctnnb1 in mouse placentae at E18.5,
  n = 6 placentae from six dams in each group, two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
  comparison test; ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05 versus the control group; #p < 0.05
  versus the agomir-NC group. (E) Schematic representation of the mechanism underlying
  the miR21/PP2A Bβ/Hippo axis in extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and placental
  development. The data are presented as the means ± SEMs.'
