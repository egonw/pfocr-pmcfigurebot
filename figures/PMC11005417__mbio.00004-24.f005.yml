caption: A muti-omics based central metabolism model of P. methaneseepsis ZRK33. In
  this model, three central metabolic pathways (associated with carbon metabolism,
  sulfur metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism) including EMP glycolysis, oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, urea cycle, assimilatory sulfate reduction,
  and some electron transport systems are shown highlighted with different colors.
  All the above items are closely related to energy production in P. methaneseepsis
  ZRK33. TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; Urea, urea cycle; ATP, 5â€²-Adenylate triphosphate;
  ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; Q, quinone; QH2, ubiquinone;
  CysN, sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 1; CysD, sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit
  2; CysC, adenylyl-sulfate kinase; CysH, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase;
  Sir, sulfite reductase; CysK, cysteine synthase; TST, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase;
  DoxA, thiosulfate dehydrogenase (quinone) small subunit; DoxD, thiosulfate dehydrogenase
  (quinone) large subunit.
