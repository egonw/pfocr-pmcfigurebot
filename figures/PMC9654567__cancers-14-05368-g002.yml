caption: Overexpression of SUN5-promoted proliferation, while knockdown of SUN5 inhibited
  the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells in vitro. (A) Transfection of SUN5
  overexpression (OE) lentivirus upregulated SUN5 expression when compared with the
  control lentivirus (NC), while shRNA silence of SUN5 (shSUN5, also called SUN5-KD)
  downregulated SUN5 expression when compared with the negative control shRNA (shCtrl)
  in LoVo and DLD-1 cells by Western blotting. Î²-tubulin was used as an internal control.
  (B,C) Overexpression or knockdown of SUN5 promoted or inhibited cell proliferation
  of CRC cells measured by colony-formation and CCK-8 assays (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01).
  (D) Cyclin D1, CDK2, and Cyclin B1 were determined by Western blotting after overexpression
  or knockdown of SUN5 in LoVo and DLD-1 cells (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
