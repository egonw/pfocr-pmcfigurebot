caption: 'TAK-242''s effect on TLR4 signaling pathway expression in HF rats. (a) IHC-stained
  liver section of liver tissue (magnification ×200). (b) IHC-stained intestinal section
  of intestinal tissue (magnification ×200). (c, d) Western blot detection of TLR4
  signaling pathway protein expression in liver tissue. (e, f) Western blot detection
  of TLR4 signaling pathway-related protein expression in intestinal tissue. (g) Color
  intensity of TLR4 signaling pathway-related protein in liver tissue. (h) Color intensity
  of TLR4 signaling pathway-related protein in intestinal tissue. (i) RT-qPCR detection
  of TLR4 signaling pathway-related protein mRNA expression in liver tissue. (j) RT-qPCR
  detection of TLR4 signaling pathway-related protein mRNA expression in intestinal
  tissue. n = 8. Compared with the control group, ##P < 0.01; compared with the model
  group, ∗P < 0.05 and∗∗P < 0.01.'
