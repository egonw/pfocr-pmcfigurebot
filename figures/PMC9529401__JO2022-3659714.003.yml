caption: MCT4/lactate promoted PD-L1 N-glycosylation via activating the WNT pathway
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. (a) CCK-8 showed that the cell viability of cells was treated
  with 7ACC1 (40 μM) with/without TM (4 μg/mL) for 12 h, 36 h, and 48 h in 231 cells
  and 468 cells. (b) GSEA plot of the WNT pathways (FDR = 0.091) and MAPK pathways
  (FDR = 0.0073) based on the shMCT4 versus shControl translation efficiency profiles.
  (c) WB showed that protein levels of p-GSK3β (ser9) (a deactivation loci), GSK3β,
  β-catenin, and PD-L1 and GAPDH in 231 cells were treated by lactate (10 mM) with/without
  XAV939 (10 μM) for 10 h. 55 KDa form (●) represents glycosylation of PD-L1, and
  34 KDa form (▲) represents non-glycosylated PD-L1. (d) CCK-8 showed that the cell
  viability of cells was treated with lactate (10 mM) with/without XAV939 (10 μM)
  for 10 h. (e) Schematic of MCT4/lactate in regulated PD-L1 expression in TBcs.
