caption: 'Cisplatin induces specific immune effects in bladder cancer cell line. T24
  cell lines were treated with 2 μg/mL cisplatin (T24 DDP group) or PBS (T24 PBS group)
  for 24 h at standard condition. (A) The different genes expression panels between
  T24 DDP group and T24 PBS group were showed in heatmap. (B) Gene expression levels
  were quantified as Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) and then Log2–transformed
  as A value. The significant different expression genes were identified as absolute
  fold change of A value > 1.5 and Padj (adjust p) value < 0.05 between two groups.
  Finally, the volcano map showed 235 up genes and 129 down genes with significant
  difference. (C) Go pathways with Padj value < 0.05 were showed here between T24
  DDP group and T24 PBS group. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in: Interferon
  α, β signaling (p < 0.001), cytokines and inflammatory response (p < 0.001) and
  cytosolic DNA sensing pathway (p < 0.002). (E) Relative transcription levels of
  genes expression involved in IRF3 and NF-κB signal pathway or targeting genes in
  T24 DDP group and T24 PBS group. Gene expressions were normalized by R software
  from −1.5 to 1.5 (Low to high, blue to red).'
