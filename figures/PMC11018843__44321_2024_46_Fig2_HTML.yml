caption: There are several factors that contribute to the source of cytosolic DNA,
  including a decrease in nucleic DNA repair functions, mitochondrial reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) damage, and the presence of nucleic acid-containing Aβ plaques. In
  response to accumulation of cytosolic DNA and PQBP1-binding Tau protein, microglia
  initiate the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and IFN-I production. Neurons
  suffer impairment from enhanced synapse engulfment by activated microglia, Aβ release
  by IFN-I, and inflammasome formation by direct cytosolic DNA sensing by AIM2.
