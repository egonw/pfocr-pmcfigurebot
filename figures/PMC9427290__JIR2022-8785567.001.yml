caption: HBV infection-related genes were associated with increased inflammation and
  several oncogenic signaling pathways. (a, b) Heat map of all significantly differently
  expression genes (DEGs) (n = 964, HBV Pos. vs. HBV Neg, in tumor tissues, and n
  = 1098, HBV Pos. vs. HBV Neg. in normal tissues). (c, d) GSEA results obtained by
  using DEGs by comparing between HBV Pos. and HBV Neg. Samples in tumor (c) and normal
  (d) tissues.
