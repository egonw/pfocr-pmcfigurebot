caption: miR-377 negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by mediating
  Dvl-2. (A) Grading clustering and heat map of gene expression levels associated
  with marker myogenesis in SMSCs transfected with control or FHL2 shRNA. (B) Enrichment
  analysis of pathways with significantly differentially expressed genes in sh-ctrl
  and FHL2 silenced cells. (C) Relative mRNA expression levels of c-Myc, Wnt5a, Wnt10b
  and Lef1 in FHL2 silenced and sh-control cells. (D) Luciferase activity of TOP/FOP
  in control and FHL2 silenced cells. (E) Western blot analysis Dvl-2 protein levels
  in FHL2 silenced and sh-control cells. (F) Western blot analysis of β-catenin protein
  expression in the nucleus of sh-control or FHL2 silenced cell. (G) Western blot
  analysis Dvl2 protein expression levels in FHL2 silenced and sh-control cells treated
  with miR-377 inhibitor for 24 h. (H) Western blot analysis of Dvl2 protein expression
  levels in FHL2 silenced and control cells treated with miR-377 Mimic for 24 h. (I)
  Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of FHL2 and Dvl2 after SMSCs were cultured in differentiation
  medium for 72 h. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
