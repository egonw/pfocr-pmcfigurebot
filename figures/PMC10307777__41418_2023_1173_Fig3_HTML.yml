figure_title: USP28 controls the stability of mature SREBP2
caption: a U2OS cells were transfected with gRNAs targeting USP28 (KO USP28) and parental
  controls were treated with 50 µg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times. Levels
  of USP28 as well as full length (flSREBP2) and mature SREBP2 (mSREBP2) were determined
  by immunoblotting. Actin is shown as loading control. b Quantification of full-length
  and mature SREBP2 signals relative to actin from (a). c A431 cells expressing inducible
  shRNA sequences targeting USP28 (shUSP28#2) were treated with 0.5 µg/ml of doxycycline
  (DOX) or solvent (ethanol, EtOH) for 72 h. During the last 6 h, 20 µM MG-132 was
  added. Cells were lysed and analysed for expression of full-length (flSREBP2) and
  mature SREBP2 (mSREBP2). Actin is shown as loading control. d U2OS cells were transfected
  with expression vectors coding for HA-tagged mature SREBP2 (aa 1-484, HA-mSREBP2)
  together with HA-tagged wild type (WT) or catalytically inactive (CA) USP28. Levels
  of USP28 and mature SREBP2 were determined by immunoblotting. Actin is shown as
  loading control. e HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors coding
  for HA-tagged USP28 or HA-tagged mSREBP2 together with His6-Ubiquitin (K48-only).
  Ubiquitinated proteins were purified using Ni-NTA and analysed by immunoblotting
  (Ub). Presence of USP28 and SREBP2 was confirmed in the input. f A431 cells expressing
  inducible shRNA sequences targeting USP28 (shUSP28#2) were treated with 1 µg/mL
  doxycycline (DOX) or solvent (ethanol) for 96 h with 20 µM MG132 being added during
  the last 6 h. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies
  detecting SREBP2. Precipitates were analysed for the presence of ubiquitinated proteins
  (Ub). Efficient silencing of USP28 and presence of full length and mature SREBP2
  was confirmed in the input. Actin is shown as a loading control. IgG bands are marked
  by asterisks. g U2OS cells were transfected with either wild type or CPD mutant
  (Ser 432 and 436 to Ala) HA-tagged mature SREBP2 together with HA-tagged USP28 or
  Flag-FBXW7. Levels of USP28, FBXW7 and mature SREBP2 were determined by immunoblotting.
  Actin is shown as loading control.
