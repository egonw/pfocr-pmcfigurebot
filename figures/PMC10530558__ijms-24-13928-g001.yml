caption: 'Primary tumors are metabolically dependent on the Warburg pathway for fast
  energy and carbon sources, and several oncogenic activations feed into it. The first
  line of cancer therapy with multiple pathway blockers can inhibit the oncogenic
  activations, but in turn, cancer cells reprogram themselves, and dependency upon
  the Warburg pathway shifts to other metabolic pathways. Moreover, the theory of
  CSC’s self-renewal is now a popular area of study, which might be a factor that
  controls tumor recurrence. The evolved drug-resistant tumors are more aggressive
  and do metastasize to distant sites in the human body and form secondary tumors.
  CSC: cancer stem cells, “↑” indicates upregulation and “?” indicates the probable
  pathway activation (This figure was drawn using the Bio Render app).'
