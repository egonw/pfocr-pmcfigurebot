caption: Overexpression of Nrf2 reverts the loss of cell viability and the cell cycle
  arrest at G0/G1 phase induced by apatinib. All data refer to of U251 and U87 cells
  transfected with the empty vector (NC) and overexpressing Nfr2. (a, b) CCK-8 assay
  shows the cell viability 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment with apatinib. (c, d)
  Representative images of the morphology of cells by an optical microscopy. (e, g)
  Representative histograms of cell cycle analysis 72 h after treatment with apatinib.
  (f, h) Quantitative analysis of cell cycle phases 72-hour after treatment with apatinib.
  ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.
