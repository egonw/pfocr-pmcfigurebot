caption: 'Involvement of PI3K-Akt pathway in EID3-mediated stemness of osteosarcoma
  cells. (a) Western blot analysis of Akt, p-Akt, and EID3 in MG-63-EID3 cells transfected
  with siRNA-Akt or Akt inhibitor AZD. (b) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8
  assay. (c) Representative images of the spheres in MG-63-EID3 cells transfected
  with siRNA-Akt or control siRNA. Scale bar, 100 μm. (d) Quantitation of sphere forming
  in MG-63-EID3 cells transfected with siRNA-Akt or control siRNA. (e) Quantitation
  of sphere forming in MG-63-EID3 cells treated with Akt inhibitor and PI3K inhibitor.
  AZD5363: AKT inhibitor. LY 294002: PI3K inhibitor. Data are shown as mean ± SD,
  n = 3. ∗∗, p < 0.01.'
