caption: 'The inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is required for PPII-mediated
  autophagy initiation in CRC cells. (A) PPII suppressed the activities of PI3K, AKT,
  and mTOR in CRC cells. The cells were treated with various concentrations of PPII
  for 24 h. The protein levels were examined using Western blotting. β-actin was used
  as a loading control. (B) The protein level of LC3B−II in CRC cells exposed to PPII,
  with or without rapa (100 nm), for 24 h. the representative immunoblotting bands
  are presented in the left panels, and the quantitative results are shown in the
  right panels. The data in the bar charts are the means ± SD of three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. vehicle control; ##p < 0.01.'
