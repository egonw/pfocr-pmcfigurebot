figure_title: CENP-A signal is activated by S961 injection in islets independent of
  insulin signal
caption: '(A and B) Experiments were performed on C57BL/6J male mice (average body
  weight of 25 g) administrated S961 (10 nM/week) or vehicle (PBS) by osmotic pump
  for 7 days.(A) Heatmap of upregulated and downregulated genes among mitotic cell-cycle
  genes in islets of S961-treated mice compared with those of PBS-treated mice (n
  = 4 mice/group).(B) Pathway analysis of significantly upregulated genes in islets
  of S961-treated mice compared with those of PBS-treated mice.(C–E) Experiments were
  performed on floxed and βIRKO mice administrated S961 (10 nM/week) or vehicle (Ns)
  by osmotic pump for 9 days.(C) Left: representative images immunostained for FoxO1,
  insulin, and DAPI from endocrine pancreas of floxed and βIRKO mice after treatment
  with S961 or vehicle (Ns) for 9 days. Right: ratio of nuclear/cytosolic FoxO1 fluorescence
  in insulin+ cells. **p < 0.01 (n = 6 mice/group).(D) Left: representative images
  immunostained for CENP-A, insulin, and DAPI from endocrine pancreas of floxed and
  βIRKO mice after treatment with S961 or vehicle (Ns) for 9 days. Right: quantification
  of CENP-A fluorescence in insulin+ cells. **p < 0.01 (n = 5 mice/group).(E) Relative
  mRNA expression levels of indicated genes normalized to GAPDH and plotted as fold
  change versus control (floxed Ns) in the islets. *p < 0.05 (n = 5 mice/group).(C–E)
  All data from three or four independent experiments are represented as mean ± SEM.
  A one-way ANOVA was performed.'
