caption: TE-NSPs elicited measurable striatal dopamine in rat 6-OHDA lesion model
  of PD. Evoked dopamine release was investigated in slices from implanted animals
  at 1-month in vivo. Color plot (bottom), cyclic voltammogram (inset), and time vs.
  concentration plot (top) of evoked dopamine release recorded in the striatum of
  an animal implanted with an enriched TE-NSP. The color plot exhibited an oxidation
  peak between 0.55 and 0.65 V and a reduction trough between −0.2 and −0.3 V, which
  are characteristic of dopamine. The maximum concentration of dopamine released by
  the implanted slice was approximately 95 nM following electrical stimulation. The
  data shown are an average of three collections, and the stimulation artifact was
  removed.
