figure_title: Resveratrol and nicotinamide riboside reactivate development partly
  through modulation of SIRT activity
caption: '(A) Violin plot showing the expression of SIRT1 in the indicated embryonic
  stages or arrested embryos or resveratrol-reactivated embryos. Underlying data can
  be found in: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Human_embryo_normalized_gene_expression_data/19775992.
  n.s. = not significant. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of SIRT1 (green) and brightfield
  in arrested untreated of treated with solvent or resveratrol-reactivated embryos.
  Embryos are co-stained with DAPI (blue), scale bar = 20 μm. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining of NRF2 (green) and brightfield in arrested untreated or treated with solvent
  or resveratrol-reactivated embryos. Embryos were co-stained with DAPI (blue), scale
  bar = 20 μm. (D) Number of embryos that remain in an arrested state or recommenced
  development (including those embryos that fragment). Embryos were either left untreated
  or treated with NR. The total number of embryos in the control group is 32 and 24
  in the NR-treated group. Underlying data can be found in . (E) Bar chart showing
  the number of arrested embryos that would reinitiate development (including embryos
  that would ultimately fragment). The total number of embryos in the control group
  is 32 and 24 in the NR-treated group. Underlying data can be found in . (F) GSEA
  for up- and down-regulated genes in Type II versus morula comparison. Underlying
  data can be found in . (G) GSEA for up- and down-regulated genes in resveratrol
  versus Type II arrested embryos. Underlying data can be found in . (H) 2D dot plot
  showing the sum of the Z-scores for the genes in the indicated KEGG categories.
  The x-axis scores the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, the y-axis the oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway. Each dot in the plot is a cell/embryo, and the top and
  right axis have the kernel density for each group of cells. The resveratrol-treated
  embryos have a filled-in color (pink) for emphasis. The locations of the arrested
  and resveratrol-treated embryos are indicated by dashed lines and labels, and the
  normal developmental states are indicated by labels. Underlying data can be found
  in . (I) Heatmap showing the expression of select oxidative phosphorylation genes.
  Underlying data can be found in . (J) Heatmap showing the expression of select glycolytic
  metabolic genes. Underlying data can be found in . GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  NR, nicotinamide riboside.'
