figure_title: Hippocampal NDNF+ cells are NGF cells
caption: 'A, schematic diagram showing viral strategy used to express EYFP or ChR2‐mCherry
  in hippocampal NDNF+ cells. Hipp., hippocampus. B, left, confocal image of a section
  of CA1 used to measure NDNF+‐EYFP fluorescence intensity across hippocampal layers.
  Right, mean (black) ± SEM (grey) fluorescence intensity across hippocampal layers
  (n = 6 slices, four mice), normalised to percentage distance from the alveus to
  the hippocampal fissure. SO, stratum oriens; SP, stratum pyramidale; SR, stratum
  radiatum. C, close‐up of the SLM showing reelin immunostaining (top left), EYFP+
  NDNF cells (top centre) and overlay (top right; scale bar: 20 μm). White arrows
  indicate reelin‐positive NDNF cells and arrowhead shows one reelin‐negative NDNF
  cell. Percentage overlap was quantified in nine slices from three mice (bottom).
  D, confocal image of a sagittal hippocampal slice (300 μm) showing selective expression
  in SLM neurons (magenta), and a biocytin‐filled pyramidal cell (cyan) in stratum
  pyramidale. DG, dentate gyrus. E, electrophysiological properties of NDNF+ cells
  and projections to pyramidal neurons. Ea, mCherry‐tagged NDNF+ cells showed late‐
  or early‐spiking properties in response to a near‐rheobase current step (black;
  quantified on right, n = 20), and sustained spiking in response to a double‐rheobase
  current step (grey; scale bars: 25 mV, 500 ms). Eb, optogenetic stimulation of NDNF+
  cells induced long‐lasting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in pyramidal
  cells at baseline (BL) (black) that were abolished by blockers of GABAA (blue; PTX:
  picrotoxin, 100 μM) and GABAB (red; CGP: CGP 55845, 1 μM) receptors (scale bars:
  1 mV, 125 ms). [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
