caption: The proposed regulatory network underlying branch angle formation in peanut.
  Blue arrows demonstrate positive regulation. Red arrows indicate repression. Dotted
  blue lines demonstrate indirect positive regulation. The inverted blue arrows indicate
  the inhibition of gravitropic growth. Gravistimulation was affected by starch and
  sucrose metabolism and regulation of CKs (cytokinins), SLs (Strigolactones) and
  auxin signaling pathways which may act synergistically in the downstream regulatory
  pathway of shoot gravitropism in peanut.
