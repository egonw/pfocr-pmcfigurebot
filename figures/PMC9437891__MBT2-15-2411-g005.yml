caption: Exposure to bactericides highly activates the proHJ transcription in B. subtilis
  168. Exponentially growing cultures in SMM were treated with the MIC of kanamycin
  (green curve) and ciprofloxacin (red curve) and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. (A)
  shows the differences in optical densities of tested cultures, whereas (B) represents
  the relative fluorescent GFP signal measured from the corresponding cultures. The
  grey‐shaded area indicates the time frame when micrographs were taken (C). The blue
  curve represents the outgrowth of control samples without antibiotic treatment.
  All measurements were performed in biological duplicates, and the mean values were
  plotted on the graphs. The relative fluorescent signal was estimated by dividing
  the GFP signal by the cell density. The value is represented in arbitrary units.
