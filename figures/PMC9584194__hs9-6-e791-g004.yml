caption: Carfilzomib increased collecting duct transporters gene expression and activated
  mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, independently of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  axis. Graphs of (A) plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (nmol/min,
  n = 10 per group), (B) serum angiotensin II (AngII, n = 5 per group), (C) Plasma
  aldosterone (pg/mL, n = 5–6 per group) and (D) urine aldosterone excretion (pg/24 h,
  n = 5–6 per group). (E) Graph of relative mRNA levels expressed as fold change of
  controls of Sglt1. Nhe1, Nkcc2, Aqp2, β-Enac, Uta1, Na-K-atpase in the kidneys (n
  = 5–6 per group). (F) Representative Western blot images and (G–J) relative densitometry
  analysis of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-SGK-1 related proteins in the cytosolic
  and nuclear fractions of the kidneys (n = 5–6 per group). Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM. All phosphorylated proteins are normalized to their respective total
  proteins and total proteins are normalized to GAPDH or α-actinin (loading controls)
  Student’s T-Test, unpaired, 2-tailed. *P < 0.05. Aqp2 = aquaporin 2; β-ENaC = epithelial
  sodium channel ENaC beta subunit; MR = mineralocorticoid receptor; NEDD4 = neural
  precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4; Nhe1 = sodium-hydrogen
  antiporter 1; Nkcc2 = Na-K-Cl cotransporter; Sglt1 = sodium-glucose cotransporter
  1; SGK-1 = serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; Uta1 = urea transporter
  A1.
