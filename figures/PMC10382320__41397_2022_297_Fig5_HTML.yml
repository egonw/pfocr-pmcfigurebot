figure_title: Affects of compounds (i.e., instances) on the PPARA pathway activity
  and expression pattern
caption: a The PPARA pathway activity score difference of the 1390 CMAP gene expressoin
  instances. The y-axis shows the difference between the activity score in the treatment
  and the paired control for each instance. The x-axis shows the instances ordered
  by decreasing corresponding activity score difference. b The connectivity score
  of the 1390 CMAP gene expression instances. The y-axis shows the connectivity score
  and the x-axis shows the instances ordered by increasing corresponding connectivity
  score. c A Venn diagram showing the intersection between the top 50 drugs identified
  by the activity score difference and the activity score.
