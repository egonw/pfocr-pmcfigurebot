figure_title: Inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity disrupts genome-wide DNA accessibility
  by repressing the co-occupancy of SMARCC2 and BRG1
caption: a HOMER motif analysis of the binding peaks of p-S166-RIPK1, SMARCC2 or BRG1
  on promoters or enhancers detected by CUT&Tag under the treatment of TNFα versus
  TNFα plus Nec-1s. b Heatmap (top) and summary plots (below) of ATAC-seq genomic
  accessibility reads under the indicated conditions over the de novo sites in Ripk1D325A/D325A;Ripk3−/−
  MEFs treated with TNFα for 2 h or 4 h. The de novo sites were calculated by the
  intersection of p-S166-RIPK1-binding peaks with the accessible genomic regions induced
  by TNFα. c The summary plots (top) and binding intensities (below) of p-S166-RIPK1,
  SMARCC2 and BRG1 under the treatment of vehicle, TNFα and TNFα plus Nec-1s were
  shown by CUT&Tag reads over the defined sites (See Supplementary information, Fig. )
  in Ripk1D325A/D325A;Ripk3−/− MEFs treated with TNFα for 2 h (1110 sites) or 4 h
  (2159 sites). The defined sites were calculated by the intersection between p-S166-RIPK1/SMARCC2/BRG1
  co-binding peaks under the treatment of TNFα and RIPK1 kinase activity-dependent
  accessible regions. The RIPK1 kinase activity-dependent accessible regions were
  defined as the accessible regions that induced by TNFα and became less accessible
  when adding Nec-1s. d Log2-transformed binding scores of SMARCC2 and BRG1 were plotted
  to show the co-occupancy of SMARCC2 and BRG1 under the treatment of vehicle, TNFα
  and TNFα plus Nec-1s over the interested genomic regions defined in Supplementary
  information, Fig. . Each point represents a specific site with the binding of SMARCC2
  (x value) and BRG1 (y value). The sites selected by the square are defined as SMARCC2/BRG1
  co-binding sites, while the sites which are plotted on x axis are defined as sites
  bound with SMARCC2 only, and the ones on y axis are defined as sites bound with
  BRG1 only. The sites which are plotted on the minus infinity of x axis and y axis
  are defined as no-binding sites, and the rest are defined as weak binding sites.
  e Summary of the percentage changes of SMARCC2/BRG1 co-binding, SMARCC2 only, BRG1
  only, no-binding and weak binding sites upon the treatment of vehicle, TNFα and
  TNFα plus Nec-1s in d. The genomic regions used here are defined in Supplementary
  information, Fig. . f The ATAC-seq profiles (orange) and CUT&Tag profiles of p-S166-RIPK1
  (red), SMARCC2 (green) and BRG1 (blue) genomic binding upon the treatment of vehicle,
  TNFα and TNFα plus Nec-1s on Tnfaip3 gene locus. g Heatmap showing the scaled normalized
  counts in RNA-seq data of the selected genes. These genes are not only induced by
  TNFα and repressed by TNFα plus Nec-1s at 2 h (42 genes) or 3 h (45 genes), but
  also the genomic targets of p-S166-RIPK1, SMARCC2 and BRG1 (in CUT&Tag) whose accessibility
  is induced by TNFα and disrupted by TNFα plus Nec-1s (in ATAC-seq). See also Supplementary
  information, Table . h Pathway analysis by Metascape for the selected target genes
  of p-S166-RIPK1, SMARCC2 and BRG1 in g. i p-S166-RIPK1 ChIP-qPCR in Ripk1D325A/D325A;Ripk3−/−
  MEFs treated with vehicle, TNFα and TNFα plus Nec-1s. For each position, ChIP binding
  normalized to input is shown as fold change to the condition treated with vehicle.
