caption: ACE2 is a chemotherapeutic drug-responsive gene specifically for breast cancer.
  A The increased reads of ACE2 during the acquisition of lapatinib resistance in
  BT-474 cells investigated by IGV. B qRT-PCR analysis showed elevated ACE2 expression
  in MDA-468, C MDA-231, D MCF-7 and E T47D cells exposed to low doses of EPI (0.1
  µM), PTX (0.025 µM and 0.05 µM) and 5-FU (1.25 µM and 2.5 µM). F Western blot analysis
  showed ACE2 expression after exposure to EPI, PTX or 5-FU in MDA-468, MDA-231, MCF-7
  and T47D cells. All data are shown as mean ± SD; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001,
  and ns P > 0.05 versus control
