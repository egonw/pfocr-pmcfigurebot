caption: 'The expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate
  8-like 1 (Eps8l1, A) and phospholipase C-β 2 (Plcb2, B) in mice hypothalamus with
  response to Asmt knockout and swimming exercise. The relative mRNA levels were conducted
  using qRT-PCR. Data are presented as means ± SEM (n = 3 per group). *P<0.05, **P<0.01
  versus WT; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 versus no swimming.'
