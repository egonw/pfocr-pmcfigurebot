caption: Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression in peripheral human lung biopsies
  at the end of cold ischemia and after two hours of reperfusion following transplantation.
  (a) The top 10 KEGG pathways with the most significant differences were observed.
  (b) Peroxisome, beta alanine metabolism, and propanoate metabolism were significantly
  activated in the end of cold ischemia samples, whereas p53, MAPK signaling pathway,
  and pathways were significantly blocked. (c) Lower activity of oxidative stress-related
  biological processes was observed in the end of cold ischemia samples. (d) Twelve
  of the 14 oxidative stress-related biological processes were significantly lower
  in the end of cold ischemia samples.
