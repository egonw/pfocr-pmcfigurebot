caption: The activity and expression of alcohol- and RSV-metabolising enzymes in different
  treatments. (A) Main metabolic enzymes in the alcohol metabolic pathway. (B) Main
  metabolic enzymes in the RSV metabolic pathway. (C) Typical multiple-reaction monitoring
  chromatograms of blank liver microsomes (a), chlorazoxazone (b), 6-hydroxy-chlorazoxazone
  (c) and IS (d). (D) Metabolism enzyme expressions of RSV and alcohol in ALD mice
  compared with normal mice. (E) Comparison of metabolism enzyme activities of alcohol
  among vehicle, ALD, and RSV-alcohol co-administration mice. (F) Metabolism enzyme
  expressions of resveratrol and alcohol in RSV-alcohol and RSV-water treatment mice
  compared with ALD mice. (G) Comparison of RSV drug enzyme activities between the
  RSV-water and RSV-alcohol treatment. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; ns, no significant.
