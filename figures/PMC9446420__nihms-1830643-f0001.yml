figure_title: STK25 inhibits PKA activity
caption: (A) Differential phosphoproteomic spectra of STK25+/+ and STK25−/− cardiomyocytes.
  Members of the PKA signaling pathway are highlighted.(B) Ingenuity phosphoprotein
  pathway analysis. Orange indicates pathways upregulated in STK25−/− cardiomyocytes,
  while blue indicates upregulation in STK25+/+.(C) PKA activity in response to 10
  μM forskolin treatment for 30 min in STK25+/+ and STK25−/− cardiomyocytes. n = 3
  for each condition.(D) PKA activity in response to 10 μM forskolin treatment for
  30 min in HEK293T cells overexpressing either empty vector, wild-type STK2,5 or
  kinase-dead K49R/T174A. n = 3 for each.Bar graph data are represented as mean ±
  SD and analyzed in technical triplicates, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001
  using ANOVA and Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons.
