figure_title: The hypothetical mechanism of BNIP3 phosphorylation-mediated mitophagy
  under hypoxia
caption: In response to moderate hypoxia (10% O2 or early stages of 0.3% O2), a generous
  amount of BNIP3 is phosphorylated at S60/T66 by JNK1/2, which blocks the conjugation
  of ubiquitin (Ub) to BNIP3, inducing mitophagy activation. In severe hypoxia (late
  stages of 0.3% O2), JNK1/2 is inactivated and BNIP3 is dephosphorylated by PP1 or
  PP2A, which leads to the recruitment of ubiquitin to BNIP3 and its degradation via
  the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suppressing the induction of mitophagy.
