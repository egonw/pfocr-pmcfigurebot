figure_title: Inhibition of the serine biosynthetic pathway enhances the expression
  of SLC7A11, and its coinhibition results in additional therapeutic effects
caption: A Changes in PHGDH expression in cell lines by CBR-5884 and arginine deiminase.
  Expression values were normalized read counts obtained from the RNA sequence. IMR-32
  cells did not show any significant changes in PHGDH expression, whereas SK-N-SH
  cells showed enhanced PHGDH expression after treatment with arginine deiminase or
  CBR-5884. B Changes in gene expressions of neuroblastoma cell lines induced by CBR-5884
  and arginine deiminase. The effects of CBR-5884 in IMR-32 cells are presented on
  the X-axis and those of a combination of CBR-5884 and arginine deiminase in SK-N-SH
  cells are indicated on the Y-axis. The effects of addition of arginine deiminase
  to CBR-5884 in SK-N-SH cells are indicated by color. C Heatmap of the expression
  levels of genes whose expressions were altered by CBR-5884 treatment in IMR-32 cells
  and altered in the same direction by the combination of two drugs in SK-N-SH cells.
  The genes were arranged by the magnitude of change in expression levels by CBR-5884
  in IMR-32 cells. D Changes in SLC7A11 expression by the two drugs; enhanced in IMR-32
  cells by CBR-5884 and enhanced significantly in SK-N-SH cells by the combination
  of the two drugs. E Schema illustrating the relationship of the metabolic pathways
  associated with serine, glycine, cystine, PHGDH, and SLC7A11. Both gene products
  are associated with glutathione production. F Combination effect of CBR-5884 and
  sulfasalazine on IMR-32 cells. The drugs were administered 24 h after seeding. Cell
  viability was found to be evaluated using CellTiter-Glo 72 h after the administration
  of the drugs. Panel E was created using BioRender.com.
