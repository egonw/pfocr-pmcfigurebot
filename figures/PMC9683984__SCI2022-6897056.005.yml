caption: 'Immunofluorescence imaging of PGP9.5 and Ku80 in the sciatic nerve. (a)
  PGP9.5 was highly expressed in the PMSC group but lower in the control group at
  7, 14, and 28 days. Contrarily, the upregulation of PGP9.5 by PMSCs was significantly
  inhibited by LGK974, and there was statistically significant difference at 14 days.
  The results demonstrated that KU80 was expressed in sciatic nerve. (b) Quantitative
  measurements were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. Data were mean ± SEM.
  n = 3; ∗PMSC group vs. control group, P<0.05; #PMSC group vs. PMSC+LGK974 group,
  P < 0.05. The scale bar: 50 μm.'
