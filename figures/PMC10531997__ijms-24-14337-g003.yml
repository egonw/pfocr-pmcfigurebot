caption: 'NPM1 is a protector of Myc due to the inefficient Myc degradation in RR
  but not the RU subset. Left panel: Western blot analysis of RU and RR cells derived
  from SupM2 before and after FL-NPM1 knockdown. The change in the Myc level was relatively
  small in RU cells (lane 1 vs. lane 2, band intensity 1.00 vs. 0.89, p > 0.05), probably
  due to the fact that PD-Myc is relatively efficient in these cells and the residual
  FL-NPM1 is sufficient to prevent the protein accumulation of Myc. In contrast, the
  same treatment led to a dramatic decrease in Myc in RR (lane 3 vs. lane 4, band
  intensity 1.44 vs. 0.77, p > 0.01), in keeping with our model that FL-NPM1-mediated
  PD-Myc is different between RU and RR cells. Right panel: After shRNA knockdown
  of FL-NPM1, RR cells were treated with 10 μM MG132, and cells were collected at
  0, 2, and 4 h. The accumulation of Myc (lane 5 vs. lane 6 and 7) after MG132 treatment
  supports the concept that the Myc decrease due to the knockdown of FL-NPM1 in RR
  cells was via the inhibition of the PD-Myc pathway. Band densitometry was calculated
  by ImageStudioLite software and results were normalized to RU-EV group. Student’s
  t-test was performed using GraphPad and results were shown in the lower panel, *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Triplicate experiments were performed and results from a
  representative experiment are illustrated.'
