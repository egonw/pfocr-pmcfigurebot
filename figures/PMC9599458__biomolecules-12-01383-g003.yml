caption: Role of calcium-permeable channel in cartilage destruction. Stimulated synovial
  cells can promote chondrocyte apoptosis by secreting inflammatory factors. At the
  same time, a large influx of calcium ions in chondrocytes triggers the activation
  of intracellular calcium ion signaling pathways (NF-ÎºB pathway, PI3K-Akt pathway,
  etc.). This eventually leads to the degradation of cartilage matrix and apoptosis,
  pyroptosis and ferroptosis of chondrocytes (created with Biorender.com).
