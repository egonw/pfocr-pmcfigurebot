caption: 'Excitatory transmission is reduced onto iMSNs in dyskinetic PNKD mice. Voltage-clamp
  recordings from iMSNs in WT and PNKD slices. A, Representative mEPSC traces from
  WT (black), nondyskinetic PNKD before and after caffeine (gray and blue), and dyskinetic
  PNKD (red) iMSNs. B, mEPSC frequency cumulative histogram (inset: averages) from
  WT, nondyskinetic (gray), and dyskinetic PNKD (red) iMSNs. C, mEPSC amplitude cumulative
  histogram (inset: averages). D, mEPSC frequency in a representative PNKD iMSN in
  response to acute application of caffeine. E, Summary of mEPSC frequency before
  and after caffeine application. Each pair of dots represents one iMSN. F, Schematic
  diagram showing recording configuration, including local intrastriatal electrical
  stimulation. G, Average PPR of evoked EPSCs from WT and PNKD mice. Inset, Representative
  evoked EPSCs with 25 ms ISI. H, Top, Representative evoked EPSCs before (thin line)
  and after (thick line) HFS. Bottom, Normalized EPSC amplitude in WT before and after
  HFS. I, Top, Representative evoked EPSCs before and after application of WIN55212.
  Bottom, Normalized evoked EPSC amplitude in WT and PNKD iMSNs treated with WIN55212.
  Data are mean Â± SEM.'
