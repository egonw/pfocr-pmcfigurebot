caption: The effect of acupuncture on the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. Three major
  intracellular signaling pathways are activated after needling. The first pathway
  is the activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade,
  which promotes neuronal differentiation and growth through MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)
  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). It activates the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) cascade. Another pathway is the activation of phospholipase C-γ1
  (PLC-γ1), which leads to the production of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). Whereas DAG stimulates protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, InsP3 promotes Ca2+
  release from internal stores and subsequent activation of Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent
  protein kinases (CaMKII, CaMKK, and CaMKIV) These signaling pathways all regulate
  gene transcription and some may be involved in LTP. (This figure is drawn by Figdraw).
