caption: Carambolaside W inhibited ROS production in MDCK cells after infection with
  the H1N1 influenza virus. (A) Enzyme marker was used to assess the intensity of
  DCF fluorescence generated by intracellular ROS oxidation. (B) Inverted microscopy
  was used to observe MDCK cells and the changes in the intensity of DCF fluorescence
  expression therein. The concentration of carambolaside W used here is 32 Î¼M. Using
  the one-way ANOVA de-calculate and Bars with different characters are statistically
  different at p < 0.0001 (****) and p < 0.05 (*) vs. control group. Each experiment
  was repeated at least three times (n = 3).
