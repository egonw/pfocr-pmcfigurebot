caption: Changes in the WNT microenvironment. (A) mRNA expression of WNT signalling
  pathway genes in A549 3D aggregates relative to PC9 3D aggregates. (B) mRNA expression
  of WNT signalling pathway genes in A549-CR 3D aggregates relative to A549 3D aggregates.
  (C) mRNA expression of WNT signalling pathway genes in PC9-CR 3D aggregates relative
  to PC9 3D aggregates. (D) mRNA expression of WNT signalling pathway genes in A549-CR
  3D aggregates relative to PC9-CR 3D aggregates. (The cut-off was at and above a
  2-fold increase or decrease in the values detected by the arrays. The full analysis
  data can be viewed in ).
