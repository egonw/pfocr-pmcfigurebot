caption: 'GO enrichment analysis of gene pathway between PD1+E0771M-AP NPs group and
  PD1 group. (A) Volcanic map of differential genes in cancer-associated fibroblasts
  between PD1 group and PD1+E0771M-AP NPs group. Typical genes were marked in the
  diagram. The threshold values were p < 0.05 and |log2FC| >1. (B) Heatmap of top
  20 differential genes in vascular endothelial cells between PD1 group and PD1+E0771M-AP
  NPs group. (C) Gene pathway enrichment analysis based on gene differences between
  cancer associated fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cell, and T cells in PD1+E0771M-AP
  NPs group and PD1 group. Key pathways were marker in bold. (D) GSEA analysis between
  group PD1+E0771M-AP NPs and group PD1 based on differential expression genes. The
  graph was consisted of line chart of gene enrichment score and rank distribution
  of all genes. (E) The heat map of the most activity regulons in ECM CAFs and wound
  healing CAFs (a: ECM CAFs; b: wound healing CAFs). (F) The RSS ranking plot of the
  regulon with the highest specific correlation of ECM CAFs and Wound healing CAFs.
  The red dots are the top 3 regulons with highest score. (G) The heat map of ligand-receptor
  interaction pair number between different cell types in Control group and PD1 + E0771M-AP
  NPs group.'
