caption: Ferulic acid, pterostilbene, and tyrosol do not modulate the IRE1 or the
  ATF6 pathway of the UPR in response to severe ER stress. H9c2 cells were pre-treated
  for 1 h with ferulic acid (FrA, 5 µM), pterostilbene (Pts, 0.5 µM), or tyrosol (Tyr,
  1 µM), and then wer3e treated for 6 h with tunicamycin (TN, 10 µg/mL), and the relative
  mRNA levels of the IRE1 pathway target genes P58IPK (A, n = 4) and Xbp1s (B, n =
  4), and the ATF6 pathway target genes Calreticulin (C, n = 4) and PDIA4 (D, n =
  3), were quantified by qPCR. The protein levels of the GRP78 and GRP94 chaperones
  were analyzed by western blot after 36 h. Representative western blots under ferulic
  acid (E), pterostilbene (F), or tyrosol (G) treatment are presented. Bar graphs
  show the quantitative western blot analysis for the GRP78 (H, n = 5) and GRP94 (I,
  n = 5) proteins. Actin was used as a loading control. Values represent mean ± S.E.M.
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. control.
