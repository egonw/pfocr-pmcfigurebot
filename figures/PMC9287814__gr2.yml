caption: Stress-induced flux redistribution(A–C) Mean and SD of the distribution of
  normalized flux rates obtained using stochastic stimulation algorithm (SSA) for
  13C-MFA (see  details). Estimation is restricted to a set of elementary flux parameters
  (while other fluxes can be derived from balance equations) where the index i indicates
  the enzyme and the index j indicates the directionality and where estimation is
  performed for basal (B, blue) or stress (S, red) conditions. Triangles indicate
  parameter estimation that is statistically significant based on the relative size
  of confidence interval distribution (see B). (B and C) Representation of the net
  flux rates in basal (B) and stress (C) conditions.
