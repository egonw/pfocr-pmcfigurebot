caption: 'MTERF1 promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A) Relative
  MTERF1 protein expression in different colorectal cell lines: normal human colorectal
  mucosal cell (FHC) and colorectal cancerous cell lines (HT-29, HCT-8, SW480, Caco-2,
  HCT116, and RKO). (B,C) Efficiency of MTERF1 overexpression in HT-29 cells and individual
  MTERF1-shRNA knockdown in HCT116 cells verified by Western blotting (B) and real-time
  PCR (C). Vector: pCDH; MTERF1: MTERF1-pCDH. α-Tubulin was used as an internal control,
  and RNAi-Vector was used as a scramble shRNA control. (D) Overexpression of MTERF1
  significantly promoted HT-29 cell growth, while knockdown of MTERF1 inhibited HCT116
  cell growth. (E) Overexpression of MTERF1 significantly enhanced HT-29 cell viability,
  while knockdown of MTERF1 inhibited HCT116 cell viability. (F) Overexpression of
  MTERF1 promoted HT-29 cell colony formation ability, while knockdown of MTERF1 inhibited
  HCT116 cell colony formation ability. (G) Wound healing assay showed that overexpression
  of MTERF1 promoted the migration of HT-29 cells, and knockdown of MTERF1 inhibited
  the migration of HCT116 cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (H) Overexpression of MTERF1 increased
  HT-29 Transwell cell invasion (48 h), and knockdown of MTERF1 by independent shRNAs
  decreased HCT116 Transwell cell invasion (48 h). Scale bar: 100 μm. Data are presented
  as the means ± SEM (n ≥ 3). NS represents no significant difference (p > 0.05).
  * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA and two-tailed Student’s t-test.'
