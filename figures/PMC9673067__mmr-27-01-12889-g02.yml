caption: 'DEX reduces oxidative stress and restores antioxidant capacity in a murine
  model of asthma. (A) Representative images of DHE-stained (red fluorescence) and
  DAPI-stained (blue fluorescence) lung tissue sections. The airway epithelial cells
  are indicated by yellow arrows and the inflammatory cells around the airways are
  indicated by white arrows. Magnification, ×100; scale bar, 100 µm. (B) The mean
  fluorescence density of the DHE-stained lung tissue sections represented ROS generation
  in the lung tissues. (C) A commercial MDA assay kit was used to assess the MDA content
  per mg protein. (D) The activity levels of SOD per mg of protein in the lung tissues
  were assessed using SOD assay kits. (E) GSH levels in the lung tissues were assessed
  using GSH assay kits. Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). ***P<0.001
  vs. control; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. OVA. DEX, dexmedetomidine; DHE, dihydroethidium;
  GSH, reduced glutathione; MDA, malondialdehyde; OVA, ovalbumin; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
