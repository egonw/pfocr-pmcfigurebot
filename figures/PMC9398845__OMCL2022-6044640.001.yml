caption: 'Sensitive rapamycin signaling pathways and route for inhibition of the mTOR
  pathway. The normal mTOR signaling pathway leads to new cell development via ribosomal
  machinery and through the initiation of the translation process. Hence, rapamycin
  inhibits the mTOR pathway that leads to inhibition of cell growth, proliferation,
  and cell cycle progression. RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; GPR: G-protein coupled
  receptor; RAS: renin angiotensin system; PIK3: phosphoinositide-3-kinase; Akt: protein
  kinase-B; IkB: nuclear factor; NFkB: nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of
  activated B cells; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; 4E-BP1: eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor; p70s6k: ribosomal protein S6 kinase.'
