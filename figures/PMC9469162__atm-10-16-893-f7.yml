caption: Upregulation of miR-195-5p expression suppresses xenograft tumor growth in
  BALB/c-nu mice. (A) The transfection efficiency in GBC-SD which stable overexpression
  of miR-195-5p was detected by fluorescence microscopy (original magnification, ×100)
  and qRT-PCR. (B,C) Photographs of the mice and dissected tumors that were treated
  with Lv-NC or Lv-miR-195-5p. (D,E) The volumes and weights of the tumors grown in
  the xenograft mouse model. (F) Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues treated with
  Lv-NC or Lv-miR-195-5p (original magnification, ×100). Data are mean ± SD. *P<0.05
  compared with control group. n=5. qRT-PCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction; Lv-NC, lentiviral negative control; Lv-miR-195-5p, lentiviral miR-195-5p;
  SD, standard deviation.
