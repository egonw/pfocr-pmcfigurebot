caption: 'DSS inhibited the expression of NF-κB, COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HL-1
  cells after OGD/R. (A) Bar graph quantitation of DSS on the viability of HL-1 cells.
  After OGD/R, the protective effect of DSS on HL-1 cells and its effect on the expression
  of CXCR1 protein were evaluated by immunocytofluorescence. (B) Representative images
  of each group, in which the nuclei were stained in blue by Hoechst and the CXCR1
  protein was stained green. Scale bar = 100 µm. (C) Bar graph quantitation of the
  number of cells in each group. (D) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity
  of CXCR1 in each group. (E) Representative images of each group. The nucleus was
  stained blue, and NF-κB, COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were labeled green. Scale bar
  = 50 µm. (F) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity of NF-κB in each
  group. (G) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity of COX-2 in each
  group. (H) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity of ICAM-1 in each
  group. (I) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity of VCAM-1 in each
  group. Values were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ###P < 0.001 vs. Ctrl group;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. OGD/R group; ▲P < 0.05 vs. Reparixin group.
  ns: no significance.'
