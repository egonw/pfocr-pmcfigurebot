caption: (A) Interaction measurement between myeloid cells by condition and time.
  Total number of interactions are shown on the Y-axis, while interaction strengths
  are shown by the size of circles. (B) Relative interaction counts and strength compared
  to T1 calculated using data from (A). (C) Overall signaling level by population
  at each time point. X-axis measures the outgoing signals, Y-axis measures the incoming
  signals. The direction of the arrows show the direction of enrichment. (D) Signaling
  information flow by ligand-receptor pairs ranked by the burn-to-unwounded ratio
  and the significance level. The labels of the ligands are color-coded by their bias
  towards one of the two conditions. (E) Venn plot presenting common and unique candidate
  ligand-receptor pairs across time points. (F) Myeloid subset signaling network of
  IL6 pathway. Population color coding is shared with (C).
