caption: T cell subgroups were significantly up-regulated in oxidative phosphorylation.
  (A) The Deconvolution method was used to standardize the single-cell data, and the
  results showed that the expression ratio after the correction was more consistent.
  (B) Metabolic pathway activity in T cell subgroups. (C) Distribution of metabolic
  pathway activity in T cell subgroups. (D) Major metabolic pathways are enriched
  in all subgroups. The node size is -log10 p-value. Color intensity indicates the
  enrichment score (NES) after correction.
