caption: LiCl‐induced periodontal regeneration was associated with M2 polarization.
  Representative images from μCT, AZAN staining, and H&E staining showed that LiCl
  administration significantly induced periodontal tissue repair compared with the
  PBS‐administration controls. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the successful
  activation of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling induced by LiCl administration, which further
  led to the infiltration of macrophages (CD68+ cells) where the major components
  were of Arginase+ M2 phenotype and the iNOS+ M1 phenotype was obviously suppressed,
  at both 1 and 2 weeks as compared to the PBS‐treatment group. AB, alveolar bone;
  D, dentin; PDL, periodontal ligament
