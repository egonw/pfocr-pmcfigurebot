caption: 'FEM1B is a miR-29b regulatory target gene. (a) The predicted miR-29b binding
  site in the 3′-UTR of FEM1B and the mutated 3′-UTR of FEM1B, which were generated
  using the complementary sequence in the seed region of miR-29b. (b) miR-29b or NC
  and a luciferase vector encoding the WT or MUT FEM1B 3′-UTR were transfected into
  293T cells, and the relative luciferase activity was measured. (c) Overexpression
  of miR-29b inhibited the expression of FEM1B mRNA in NSCLC cells. (d) Overexpression
  of miR-29b inhibited the expression of FEM1B protein in NSCLC cells; ∗P ≤ 0.05 compared
  with the NC-A549 group; #P ≤ 0.05 compared with the NC-NCI-H-1792 group.'
