caption: The endogenous content of major defense and signaling related phytohormones
  (A–F) including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin (AUX), ethylene (ACC), methyl jasmonate
  (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), over the course of this study (mock-inoculated and
  PM inoculated after 48h phi) PM infection of susceptible and resistant watermelon
  lines, over early stages of invasion in leaves. The bars represent the standard
  error obtained from triplicate samples. *, **, and *** represent significant differences
  at P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001 (t-test), respectively. An unpaired t-test
  (P ≤ 0.05) was applied for the test of significance in hormone concentration in
  both contrasting lines. ns, not statistically significant.

  and phenylpropanoid pathway in early-stage resistance against powdery mildew in
