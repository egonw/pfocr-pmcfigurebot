figure_title: MCR triggered a positive feedback loop between SLC43A2 and NFκB signaling
  pathway to regulate the proliferation and apoptosis in ESCC
caption: A The expression of SLC43A2, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved PARP were detected in
  ESCC cells transfected with SLC43A2 siRNA via western blot. B, C EdU assays (B)
  and TUNEL assays (C) were used to detected the proliferation and apoptosis of ESCC
  cells in (1) si-Ctrl+ddH2O group; (2) si-SLC43A2+ddH2O group; (3) si-SLC43A2 + 30 μM
  Met group, respectively, n = 5 for each group, scale = 50 μm. D The correlations
  between SLC43A2, CHUK, IKBKB, IKBKG, NFKBIA, NFKB1 and RELA in ESCA were analyzed
  via TCGA database, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. E Western blot was used to detect the
  expression of p-IKKα/β (Ser176/180), p-p65 (Ser536), IKKα/β and p65 in ESCC cells
  under MCR condition (left panel) or transfected with SLC43A2 siRNA (right panel).
  F The expression of p-IKKα/β (Ser176/180), p-p65 (Ser536), IKKα/β, p65 and SLC43A2
  were detected in (1) DMSO+ddH2O group, (2) Bay 11-7082+ddH2O group; (3) Bay 11-7082 + 30 μM
  Met group, respectively. All cells were cultured in complete cell culture medium.
  G The content of SAM was detected respectively in (1) control+ ddH2O; (2) Bay 11-7082+ddH2O;
  (3) Bay 11-7082 + 30 μM Met; (4) Bay 11-7082 + 50 μM Met; n = 5 for each group,
  ***P < 0.001. H, I EdU assays (H) and TUNEL assays (I) were performed to analyzed
  the apoptosis and proliferation of ESCC cells, respectively, scale = 50 μm. n = 5
  for each group, ***P < 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5).
