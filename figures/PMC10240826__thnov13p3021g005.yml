caption: MiR-451a downregulated BACE1 transcription by targeting TLR4/IKKβ/NF-κB signal
  pathway. (A) The activity of BACE1 enzyme in primary cortical neurons after miR-451a
  mimic treatment. (B) qRT-PCR showed that miR-451a expression was significantly up-regulated
  in 293T cells after miR-451a mimic (50 nM) treatment. (C) qRT-PCR showed that BACE1
  mRNA levels were prominently decreased in 293T cells after miR-451a mimic (50 nM)
  treatment. (D) A Venn diagram showing transcription factors (816 genes) from TRRUST
  overlapped with the target genes of miR-451a predicted by miRanda (206 genes) or
  TargetScan (495 genes). (E) The direct targets of miR-451a predicted by TargetScan
  and miRanda did not include BACE1 but include TLR4, which mediated IKKβ/NF-κB pathway
  to downregulate BACE1 production. (F, G) Representative Western blot bands and densitometry
  analysis for TLR4/IKKβ/NF-κB pathway-related proteins showed that overexpression
  of miR-451a reduced TLR4 expression, p-IKKβ/IKKβ and p-P65/P65 in the mPFC of APP/PS1
  mice. (H) qRT-PCR showed that TLR4 siRNA (100 nM) reduced the mRNA levels of TLR4
  in N2a cells. (I, J) Representative Western blot bands and densitometry analysis
  showed that TLR4 siRNA (100 nM) reduced the levels of TLR4, p-IKKβ/IKKβ, p-NF-κB/NF-κB
  and BACE1 in N2a cells. (K) qRT-PCR showed that overexpression of TLR4 increased
  the mRNA levels of TLR4 in N2a cells. (L, M) Representative Western blot bands and
  densitometry analysis showed that miR-451a mimic reduced the protein levels of TLR4
  and BACE1, and overexpression of TLR4 normalized the levels of these proteins in
  N2a cells. (N) The sequence analysis indicated the nucleotide base pairing of the
  miR-451a binding region in TLR4 3′UTR. The mutant sequence of TLR4 3′UTR for luciferase
  analysis was provided at the bottom. (O) The quantification of luciferase reporter
  assays of WT and Mut sequence of TLR4 3′UTR in 293T cell after treatment of miR-451a
  mimic. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n = 6 per group. Significance was evaluated
  with Student's t-test (A, B, C, H, J, K), two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test
  (G, O), or one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test (M). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001.
