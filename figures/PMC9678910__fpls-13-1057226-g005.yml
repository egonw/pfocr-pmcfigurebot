caption: 'Integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling. (A) DEGs
  involved in the lignin synthesis pathway. (B) DEGs involved in the suberin and cutin
  synthesis pathway. (C) Potential DAMs involved in fruit russeting. (D) Proposed
  model of russeting in apples (Red and blue arrows indicate upregulated and downregulated
  genes in the pathway, respectively; red and blue circles indicate the increased
  and reduced metabolites, respectively). (E) qRT-PCR validation of the transcriptome
  data; significance was calculated according to Student’s t-test: *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01.'

  between russet and non-russet apples.
