caption: Overexpression and knockdown of GLUT3 regulates stemness markers in CRC cells.
  (A) HCT116 cells were transfected with GLUT3/pEJ-3HA (2 µg) for 24 h. Western blot
  analysis was conducted for measuring the protein levels of GLUT3, Nanog and OCT3/4.
  (B) qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the mRNA levels of GLUT3, Bmi1, Nanog and OCT3/4.
  (C) Western blot analysis was conducted for measuring the protein levels of GLUT3,
  Nanog and OCT3/4 in shGLUT3-transfected SW620 cells. (D) qRT-PCR was conducted to
  measure the mRNA levels of GLUT3, Bmi1, Nanog and OCT3/4 in shGLUT3-transfected
  SW620 cells. GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; CRC, colorectal cancer; qRT-PCR, quantitative
  reverse transcription PCR. Data are the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance
  was analyzed by analysis of variance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001,
  significantly different compared with control.
