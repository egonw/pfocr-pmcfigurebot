caption: 'Pancreatic cancer pathogenesis: The pathogenesis of PC involves non- and
  modifiable risk factors that induce chronic inflammation mediated by several cell
  types. Chronic inflammation mediates TME development characterized by stromal desmoplastic
  reaction—the main PC histological hallmark, leading to fibrotic stoma formation,
  rich in type I collagen, fibronectin, and hyaluronic acid (HA). KRAS mutations may
  be activated by inflammation and modifiable risk factors such as diet and diabetes
  mellitus. Chronic inflammation and KRAS mutations are the main actors that induce
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, contributing to PC-TME development, correlated with increased
  phosphorylated levels. Currently, the mentioned PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have been
  used in clinical studies. “+” activates.'
