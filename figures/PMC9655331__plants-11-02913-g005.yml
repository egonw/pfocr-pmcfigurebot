caption: 'Cachrys extracts down-regulate p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein levels in RAW
  264.7 macrophage cells. The expression of p-JAK2, total-JAK2, p-STAT3 and total-STAT3
  was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed after 2 h as indicated
  in materials and methods. Equal amounts of total cellular extract (30 µg) were analyzed.
  β-Actin was used as loading control. The graphs show the densitometric analysis:
  phosphorylated forms were normalized on relative total proteins that have been previously
  normalized versus β-Actin. CLb: C. libanotis; CFb: C. ferulacea; CPb: C. pungens.
  Formulations were prepared as reported in the Materials and Methods . Significant
  difference versus control with LPS: *** p < 0.001; significant difference versus
  bergapten (BG, positive control): ### p < 0.001 (Dunnett’s multiple comparison test).'
