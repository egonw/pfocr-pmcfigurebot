caption: Pygo2 knockdown ameliorated clinical signs of colitis in Il‐10 −/− mice.
  Il‐10 −/− mice were infected with lentivirus by intravenous (IV) injection to induce
  Pygo2 overexpression (OE) or shRNA to induce Pygo2 knockdown (KD); Il‐10 −/−  mice
  were the model group, and WT mice were the control group (8 mice/group). The mice
  were treated at eight weeks of age for 4 weeks (1 × 109 viral particles/mouse/week).
  The percentage change in body weight in WT, Il‐10 −/− and Il‐10 −/−  Pygo2 OE or
  Pygo2 KD mice (A). The disease activity index (DAI) values in the four groups were
  observed every week (B). Representative pathological images stained with H&E and
  inflammation scores of colon tissues (C‐D). In vivo imaging of intestinal inflammation
  and representative bioluminescent images are shown (E). The mRNA and protein levels
  of inflammatory mediators (IL‐6, IL‐17A, TNF‐α and IFN‐γ) were measured by RT–qPCR
  (F) and ELISA (G). WT, wild‐type; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; IL‐17A, interleukin‐17A;
  TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐α; IFN‐γ, interferon‐γ; OE, Pygo2 overexpression;
  KD, Pygo2 knockdown. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05.
