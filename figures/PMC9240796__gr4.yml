caption: 'Myriocin activates the HIF-1 signaling pathway(A) HT22 cells treated with
  myriocin (0.5 μM) for indicated time were subjected to qPCR to measure the relative
  mRNA expression of indicated genes. Heatmap showing the log2 fold change (FC) between
  myriocin treatment and control samples of triplicate experiments.(B) HT22 cells
  were treated with myriocin (0.5 μM) in the presence or absence of DHS (1 μM) for
  36 h. HIF1α (green) was monitored by immunofluorescence staining and nuclei were
  stained with DAPI (blue), scale bar: 20 μm.(C) HT22 cells treated with myriocin
  (0.5 μM) for indicated time were subjected to Western blotting to monitor the protein
  levels of HIF1α, PDK1, and BNIP3.(D) Schematic diagram of glycolysis, tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, and mitophagy which are regulated by PDK1 and BNIP3. Glucose and
  its metabolites including pyruvate, lactate, and citrate which were monitored in
  this study are marked in green. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose yields
  two molecules of pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to Acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and enters the TCA cycle. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase can be inhibited
  by the phosphorylation induced by PDK1. BNIP3 accumulated on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane may interact with LC3 to promote mitophagy.(E) Relative levels of intracellular
  glucose, pyruvate, lactate, and citrate in HT22 cells after treatment with or without
  myriocin (0.5 μM) or DHS (1 μM) for 36 h. Error bars represent the mean ± SD (n =
  3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(F) With or without myriocin (0.5 μM) or
  DHS (1 μM) treatment for 36 h, mitochondria and nuclei of HT22 cells were detected
  by fluorescence microscopy after labeling with MitoTracker (red) and DAPI (blue).'
