caption: Potential roles of Irisin (Ir) in different signaling pathways and molecular
  processes involved in cancer progression, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis,
  hypoxia, metabolic changes, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration
  of cancer cells. Ir has been observed in cancer cells and is also expressed in cancer-associated
  fibroblasts. This protein is cleaved from FNDC5 prohormone and has the potential
  to affect the neighboring cells (paracrine) or the cells from which it has been
  released (autocrine). Ir dimerizes and creates a homodimer with a beta sheet positioned
  between monomers and binds as a ligand to the integrin receptor. Ir binding to the
  receptor can affect many signaling pathways. Ir inhibits proliferation via the AMPK–mTOR
  pathway and increases glucose uptake via GLUT4 incorporation into the cell membrane.
  Ir affects the STAT3/Snail pathway, inhibits IL-6, and reverses EMT. Ir decreases
  the expression of N-cadherin and increases the expression of E-cadherin. Snail is
  downregulated by Ir via decreased phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt.
