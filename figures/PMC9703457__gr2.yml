caption: Effect of radiation and impact of pre-treatment with CDX-301 on canonical
  signaling pathways and related miRNA expressions(A and B) Heatmaps depict (A) the
  differential regulation of canonical signal transduction pathways and (B) the differential
  expression of miRNAs involved in the HOTAIR regulatory pathway in the serum of the
  RV and RD groups compared with NRV control group at different time intervals, i.e.,
  on day 1, 4, 7, or 14 post irradiation. (C and D) Heatmaps show (C) the differential
  regulation of canonical signal transduction pathways and (D) the differential expression
  of miRNAs involved in the HOTAIR regulatory pathway in the spleen of the RV and
  RD groups compared with NRV control group at different time intervals, i.e., on
  day 1, 4, 7, or 14 post irradiation.
