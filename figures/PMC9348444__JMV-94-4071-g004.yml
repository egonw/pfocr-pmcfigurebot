caption: Regulation of host cell receptors by SARS‐CoV‐2‐Spike protein. (A) Sequential
  events of viral‐host cell membrane fusion were diagrammatically represented involving
  SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 receptors. (B) The expression patterns
  of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in normal tissues were shown by heatmap. The
  expression patterns were analyzed by the Open Access FunRich functional enrichment
  analysis tool (http://www.funrich.org/index.html). (C) Cell and tissue tropism of
  SARS‐CoV‐2. After successful infection, the virus disseminates in different organ
  tissues of the human body including the lung, pancreas, liver, brain, intestine,
  heart, and skin.
