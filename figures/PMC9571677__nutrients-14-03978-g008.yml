caption: 'Mon suppresses the activation of Akt/GSK-3β pathway in LPS-treated osteoclast
  derived from BMMs and the molecular docking studies (n = 3). (A(a)) Representative
  imagines of Western blot for the expression of P-GSK-3β, GSK-3β, P-AKT and AKT in
  osteoclast; (A(b,c)) quantitative analysis of P-GSK-3β/GSK-3β and P-AKT/AKT, respectively.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with LPS group at corresponding time point. (B(a))
  SC79, an Agonist of AKT reversed the regulatory effects of Mon on AKT pathway in
  osteoclast as showed by expression of key proteins in representative images of Western
  blot; (B(b)) quantitative analysis of P-AKT/AKT. * p < 0.05 vs. ctrl group, # p
  < 0.05 compared with SC79 group. (C) predicted binding mode of Mon with Akt. The
  data are expressed as means ± SD.'
