caption: LCL161 activates the ncNF-κB signaling pathway in TAC T cells. 0.5x106 TAC
  T cells were stimulated on plates coated with 0.05 ng/mL BCMA-Fc and either DMSO
  or 0.625 µM LCL161. Cells were collected and lysates were processed, ran on 4-20%
  polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted for NF-κB2 p100/p52. (A) Representative western
  blot indicating levels of NF-κB2 p100 and p52. (B-C) Signal quantification and normalization
  using Li-Cor Empiria software. NF-κB2 p100 and p52 signal was quantified and normalized
  to total protein loaded per lane and a ratio was calculated. (B) n=5. **p<0.01 as
  calculated by two-tailed paired t test. (C) data from individual donors in (B) These
  data represent 2 independent experiments.
