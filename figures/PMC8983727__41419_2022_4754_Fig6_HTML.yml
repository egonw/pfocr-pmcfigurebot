figure_title: Nogo-B overexpression upregulated the Notch signaling pathway
caption: A Heat map of genes related to the Notch pathway with RNA-seq for CMECs from
  AAV-NC or AAV-Nogo-B-infected mice after MI. B GSEA analyses of the gene set upregulated
  by Nogo-B overexpression in CMECs. C Protein levels of Notch and Hes1 in the AAV-Nogo-B
  and AAV-NC infected hearts after MI in border (BZ) and remote zone (RZ) of infarcted
  hearts (n = 5). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus sham group. D Protein levels of Notch
  and Hes1 in ECs treated with DAPT and siNotch (n = 5). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus
  Ad-NC group. ns, not significant. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA
  (C, D).
