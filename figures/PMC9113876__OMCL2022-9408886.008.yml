caption: (a–c) The boxplots compared the AUC values of TMZ calculated by ridge regression
  using the two databases of PRISM and CTRP between low- and high-FRscore in the TCGA
  (a), meta-CGGA (b), and meta-GEO (c) LGG cohorts (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). (d–f)
  Kaplan-Meier curves represent the LGG subgroups of patients with different FRscore
  levels and TMZ therapy status to reflect the OS (d) and PFI (e) statuses in the
  TCGA cohort and OS status in the meta-CGGA cohort (f). (g) GSEA result showed that
  the hallmark of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway was enriched in the high-FRscore LGG subgroup.
  (h) The PIK3CA, AKT1, and MTOR mRNA expressions were compared between HepG2 cells
  treated with erastin and control cells using data from GSE104462 (Students' t-test).
  (i) The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-associated protein expressions of matched LGG samples
  from different FRscore subgroups were compared and visualized by boxplots (Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test). (j) The bar plots represent the mRNA expression levels of PIK3CA,
  AKT1, and MTOR in SW1088 cells treated with 10 μM erastin for 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours.
  (k) The bands showed the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-associated protein expression levels
  in SW1088 cells treated with 10 μM erastin for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours. The labelled
  asterisk indicated the statistical p value (ns p > 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
