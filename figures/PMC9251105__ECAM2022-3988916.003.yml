  data analysis, correlation of YWHAG, and HIF-1α expression in cervical cancer samples
  measured by microarray platform; Western blotting was used to detect the expression
  of YWHAG in HeLa (b). The expression positions of YWHAG and HIF-1α in HeLa (c) detected
  by immunofluorescence. TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas. ∗∗P < 0.01. Scale = 5 μm.
