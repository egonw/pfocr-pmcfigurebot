figure_title: Dependence of OA-mediated SKN-1A activity on LDs
caption: (A) Suppressors of SKN-1A target (gst-4) activation in GSC(−) animals identified
  in a screen of LD-related genes (see table S2 and data S1 for complete list and
  details). (B) Overlap between gst-4 suppressors and an LD proteome from human hepatocarcinoma
  cells (see data S3 for details) (). (C) Genes required for SKN-1A activation alter
  LD morphology, as visualized by DHS-3::GFP. Scale bar, 50 μm. (D) Knockdown of the
  LD genes fitm-2 and plin-1 blocks SKN-1A nuclear accumulation in GSC(−) animals
  (see data S2 for details). (E and F) Life-span extension from GSC ablation requires
  the LD biogenesis/function proteins FITM-2 and PLIN-1 (see table S2 for details).
  (G) SKN-1A activation requires fitm-2 and plin-1 independently of the CDP-DAG PC
  production pathway, revealed by choline rescue. Numbers above the graph bars denote
  the sample size (biological replicates). ***P < 0.001. N.S., P > 0.05.
