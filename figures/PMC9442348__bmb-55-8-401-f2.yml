caption: Knockout of Ahnak upregulates the expression of cell cycle-related genes
  in the liver after PH. (A) Cyclin and cell cycle-related mRNA expression levels
  in the liver at the indicated time points after PH. (B) Representative western blot
  of cyclins B1, D1, and E1 and CDK4 protein levels in the liver at the indicated
  time points after PH. (C) Representative western blot of Rb and phospho-Rb levels
  in the liver at the indicated time points after PH. (D) E2F1 and E2F2 mRNA expression
  levels in the liver at the indicated time points after PH (n = 3). *P < 0.05; Error
  bars represent the mean ± SD.
