caption: Comparative analysis of translational pattern of necroptosis associated proteins
  in presence of necrostatin-1 in Neuro-2a cells. Representative immunoblot analysis
  indicating the expression level of necroptosis associated proteins (CASP8, CASP3
  and MLKL) under various treatment conditions. β-Actin was used as internal control
  in all analyses. The adjacent bar graph represents fold change in expression as
  compared to control cells in respective proteins. Results are representative of
  three independent experiments with mean ± SEM. * and & indicates p < 0.05 as compared
  to control cells and temisirolimus treated cells respectively for respective proteins.
  TCS, triclosan; Tem, temsirolimus; Nec-1, necrostatin-1.
