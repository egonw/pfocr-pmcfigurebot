caption: 'PLK4 inhibits KF apoptosis via the caspase‐9/3 pathway. (A) Left, Flow cytometry
  analysis of KF and NF apoptosis using annexin V/propidium (PI) dual labeling, and
  representative images are shown (n = 3 donors). Right, Quantitative analysis of
  apoptotic cells, including early phase (annexin V+ PI−) and late phase (annexin
  V+ PI+) apoptotic cells (n = 3 donors; **p < 0.01, compared with NFs). (B) Left,
  Western blot analysis of apoptosis‐related proteins, including caspase‐9, cleaved
  caspase‐9, caspase‐3, and cleaved caspase‐3 in NFs and KFs, and representative images
  are shown (n = 3 donors). Right, Quantitation of apoptosis‐related protein levels
  by densitometric analysis using ImageJ (n = 3 donors; **p < 0.01, compared with
  NFs). (C) Left, Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis using annexin V/PI dual labeling
  in Flag‐NC‐NFs, Flag‐PLK4‐NFs, shNC‐KFs, shPLK4‐1‐KFs, and shPLK4‐2‐KFs, and representative
  images are shown (n = 3 donors). Right, Quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells
  (n = 3 donors; ****p < 0.0001, compared with Flag‐NC‐NFs; ###p < 0.001, compared
  with shNC‐KFs). (D) Left, Western blot analysis of caspase‐9, cleaved caspase‐9,
  caspase‐3, and cleaved caspase‐3 expression in Flag‐NC‐NFs, Flag‐PLK4‐NFs, shNC‐KFs,
  shPLK4‐1‐KFs, and shPLK4‐2‐KFs, and representative images are shown (n = 3 donors).
  Right, Quantitation of apoptosis‐related protein levels by densitometric analysis
  using ImageJ (n = 3 donors; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, compared with Flag‐NC‐NFs; ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001, compared with shNC‐KFs). KFs, keloid fibroblasts; NFs, normal skin
  fibroblasts; PLK4, Polo‐like kinase 4; shRNAs, short hairpin RNAs; shNC, negative
  control shRNA.'
