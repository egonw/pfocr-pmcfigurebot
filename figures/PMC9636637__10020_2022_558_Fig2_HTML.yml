caption: Schematic diagram of the relationship between iron metabolism disorder and
  obesity and related metabolic diseases. Hepcidin over-expression can induce iron
  deficiency, and hemojuvelin (HJV) can promote hepcidin expression through the BMP/SMAD
  signaling pathway. ① In obese individuals, adipose tissue can regulate expression
  of hepcidin and HJV through overproduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines including
  IL-6, TNF-α and leptin; meanwhile, it also directly expresses hepcidin and HJV at
  high levels, which contribute to iron deficiency in obese individuals. ② The role
  of iron overload and ferroptosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nuclear
  receptor coactivator (NOCA)4 contributes to iron overload by translocating ferritin
  to lysosomes and increasing the expression of iron regulatory protein (IRP)2 and
  transferrin receptor (TfR). Lipid peroxidation of membrane phospholipids can be
  eliminated by parallel metabolic pathways, including the cyst(e)ine/GSH/GPX4 axis,
  as well as the ferroptosis inducer (RSL3). In addition, several ferroptosis inhibitors
  such as sodium selenite (GPX4 activator), deferoxamine (iron-chelating agent) and
  ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis inhibitor) can alleviate the onset and progression of
  NAFLD. ③ Iron-mediated toxic effects in beta-cells. Iron-mediated beta-cell toxicity
  is mainly due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation through the Fenton reaction.
  Excess ROS causes mitochondrial damage, leading to defects in the synthesis and
  secretion of insulin. ROS also influences the activity of the PDX1, MafA and AMPK,
  critical transcription factors for the control of insulin gene expression. In turn,
  hyperglycemia increases heme oxygenase (HO)-1 gene expression, exacerbates iron
  overload, promotes oxidative stress and the development of T2DM. In addition, misfolding
  and aggregated deposition of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) due to iron
  overload can also lead to oxidative stress through endoplasmic reticulum stress,
  mitochondrial damage and complex formation by binding to heme. Besides, iron overload
  can stimulate glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation by activating AMPK phosphorylation
  in skeletal muscle and liver, leading to an increase in glucose tolerance. ④ The
  relationship between iron overload and cardiovascular disease. Accumulation of iron
  in the heart has been supposed to depend on the penetration of Fe2+ through the
  L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (LVDCC). Non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI)
  promotes atherogenesis by leading to ROS production through the Fenton reaction
  and stimulating monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)1-mediated monocyte aggregation.
  In addition, iron overload inhibits SIRT1 and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)4, contributing
  to ferroptosis in foam cells and thus leading to atherosclerosis. Moreover, mixed
  lineage kinase (MLK)3 and Beclin1 can induce ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes through
  JNK/p53, and by affecting the levels of NOCA4, SLC7A11 and GPX4, respectively.
