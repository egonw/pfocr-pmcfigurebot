caption: Akt signaling is a major upstream target for CypA function in BMP4-induced
  osteoblast differentiation. (A,B) The Akt signaling pathway plays an important role
  in the CypA-promoted osteoblast differentiation. C2C12 cells were transfected with
  CypA (0.5 μg) and differentiated in DMEM containing 2% FBS treated with or without
  BMP4, and treated with the various kinase inhibitors. (A) After 72 h of treatment,
  the ALP staining was performed to detect ALP activity. (B) Quantification of ALP
  staining was performed at an absorbance of 480 nm. Data are expressed as mean ±
  SEM of at least three experiments. *** p < 0.001 and ** p < 0.01 compared to the
  control group. U (U0126; 10 µM; MEK inhibitor), H89 (5 µM; PKA inhibitor), Go (Go6976;
  5 µM; PKC inhibitor), SB (SB203580; 5 µM; p38 MAPK inhibitor), XI (5 µM; Akt inhibitor),
  and LiCl (1 mM; GSK3β inhibitor).
