caption: Effect of hydroxytyrosol on the cell cycle in Jurkat (panel A) and HL60 cell
  lines (panel B). Cell cycle analysis was performed with flow cytometry. Panel A
  corresponds to Jurkat cells and panel B to HL60 cells. Cells were treated with hydroxytyrosol
  IC50 for 24 h for Jurkat and 72 h for HL60 cells. Histograms from a representative
  experiment showing the effects of hydroxytyrosol on the cell cycle profile are represented
  at the top (Jurkat panel A and HL60 panel B). The lower part represents the percentage
  of cells in each of the phases of the cell cycle. Values are expressed as mean Â±
  SEM (n = 3). Different capital letters indicate significant differences between
  treatments for each phase of the cell cycle (p < 0.01).
