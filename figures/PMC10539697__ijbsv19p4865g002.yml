caption: TOF attenuates inflammation by promoting microglia anti-inflammatory polarization
  and inhibiting pro-inflammatory polarization after SCI. (A-C) Concentration-time
  curves of pro-inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord tissue of each group after SCI.
  Cytokines in supernatants of tissue lysates were detected by ELISA (The values are
  presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, one-way ANOVA; n = 3 rats per group). (D) Representative
  immunofluorescent images of spinal cord on day 7 post-injury showing the distribution
  of Iba1 (red) marked microglia in the lesion site. Nuclei were counterstained with
  DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 500 μm. (E) Co-immunofluorescence images showing the anti-inflammatory
  phenotype microglia labeled by Arg1 (green) and Iba1 (red) in the lesion site on
  day 7 post-injury. Magnifications of the boxed regions are shown on the right. Scale
  bar, 500 μm and 100 μm. (F) Quantification analysis of the number of Arg1+ Iba1+and
  iNOS+ Iba1+cells obtained from 3 regions of interest (ROIs) (The values are presented
  as mean ± SD; **p<0.01, Student's t tests; n = 3). (G) Co-immunofluorescence images
  showing the pro-inflammatory phenotype microglia labeled by iNOS (green) and Iba1
  (red) in the lesion site on day 7 post-injury. Magnifications of the boxed regions
  are shown on the right. Scale bar, 500 μm and 100 μm. (H) Western blot analysis
  and quantification of iNOS and Arg1 expression in spinal cord on day 7 post-injury
  (The values are presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA;
  n = 3 rats per group).
