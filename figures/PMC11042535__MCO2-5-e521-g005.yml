caption: Expression of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFKB2) is significantly elevated
  in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and is positively correlated with
  patient prognosis. (A) Gene Ontology pathway enrichment analysis based on the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) pattern of GSE81558 samples. (B) Functional annotations were
  conducted on the samples from GSE81558, unveiling the most prominently ranked signaling
  pathways. (C) The significant difference in the expression levels of nuclear factor
  κB (NF‐κB)‐related genes between the samples with and without hepatic metastasis
  in GSE81558 cohort, or between the samples in stages I and IV in the TCGA‐COAD cohort.
  (D and E) Genomic copy number analysis for NFKB2 in paired CRC tissues and the corresponding
  non‐cancerous tissues (NCTs) in Cohort 1. (F) The mRNA levels of NFKB2 in paired
  CRC tissues and the corresponding NCTs in Cohort 2. (G) The mRNA levels of NFKB2
  in paired CRC samples and the corresponding NCTs from the patients with hepatic
  metastasis in Cohort 3. (H) The mRNA levels of NFKB2 in the grouped CRC tissues,
  the corresponding NCTs, and the corresponding hepatic metastatic loci form the same
  patient in Cohort 3. Values are expressed as median with interquartile range (D,
  F, and H). β‐Actin was used as the internal control (F–H). Values are expressed
  as mean ± SEMs.
