caption: COPS3 ablation suppressed the viability of COAD cells and stimulated apoptosis.
  (a) qPCR assays showed the mRNA levels of COPS3 in SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the
  transfection of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control). (b) Immunoblot
  showed the expression of COPS3 in SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection of
  control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control). (c) CCK-8 assays showed
  the OD value at 450 nm wavelength of SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection
  of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control). (d and e). Colony
  formation assays showed the colony number of SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection
  of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection (control). The quantification
  was in panel (e). (f and g). Flow cytometry (FCM) assays showed the apoptosis percentage
  of SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without
  transfection (control). The quantification was in panel (g). (h) Immunoblot showed
  the expression of the indicated proteins in control or COPS3 siRNAs or without transfection
  (control). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, siCOPS3 vs. siControl.
