caption: 'Hypothetical S-nitrosation path for hTrx based on the present findings and
  literature data: S-nitrosation of hTrx in a cell context. In the cell, eNOS produces
  NO that promptly reacts with GSH forming GSNO, responsible for transnitrosate C32
  of reduced hTrx. Cys35 acts as a nucleophile and attacks C32-SNO to form a disulfide
  bond, leading to the oxidized form of hTrx. Reduced hTrx can be restored by NADPH-dependent
  hTrxR. After the oxidation of the hTrx redox site, the second step is the S-nitrosation
  of C73, the most solvent-exposed and reactive Cys residue. The S-nitrosation of
  C73 promotes the S-nitrosation of C62, the storage site, by a reversible NO internal
  transfer. Note that this mechanism regulates C73-SNO availability resulting in a
  control of Casp-3 S-nitrosation promoted by C73-SNO. Under nitrosative stress, GSNO
  also transnitrosate C69, a NO signaling pathway involved in hTrx translocation to
  the nucleus. C62 S-nitrosation exerts a cooperative effect in C69-SNO, leading to
  S-denitrosation of C69 residue and regulating the hTrx translocation to the nucleus.
  C73-SNO is also prone to thiolation reactions, such as hTrx dimerization and glutathionylation.
  The species are colored according to their reactivity, with blue as neutral or non-S-nitrosated,
  yellow, orange, and red with increasing S-nitrosation reactivity. Green arrows represent
  a physiological condition, whereas red arrows, nitrosative stress. hTrx, hTrxR,
  Casp-3 and eNOS are represented by PDB 4TRX [], 2J3N [], 1GFW [], and 3NOS [], respectively.
