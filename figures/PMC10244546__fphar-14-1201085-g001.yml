caption: The main molecular mechanism of EGCG in HCC. When hepatocytes are exposed
  to hepatitis virus, EGCG inhibits the viral entry into the cells by reducing the
  viral adherence and downregulating viral receptors on the surface of hepatocytes.
  In terms of antitumor, EGCG downregulates multiple tumor-related molecules and signaling
  pathways, including RTKs, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, mTOR, NF-κB, STAT-3, HIF-1α and MMPs,
  to inhibit proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and migration. Simultaneously,
  EGCG upregulates p21 expression to induce cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the antitumor
  effects of EGCG are manifested in the stimulation of apoptosis through activating
  mitochondrial cytochrome C and TRAIL/TRAILR pathways. The activation of AMPK pathway
  is also involved in the regulation of EGCG in autophagy of hepatoma cells. In mitochondria,
  EGCG blocks the metabolic reprogramming of hepatoma cells by inhibiting the activity
  of HMG-CoA lyase, thereby reducing the production of ketone body. This figure was
  drew using Figdraw.
