caption: Deletion of TRIM25 from HEK293 cells does not affect activation of RIG-I
  signalling. (A) HEK293 cell lines were transfected with 100 ng/ml of the IAV-derived
  synthetic RNA 3p-hpRNA and incubated for 6 h. Levels of IRF-3 phosphorylation were
  assayed by western blot. (B) HEK293 cell lines were infected with PR8 R38K41A IAV
  (MOI = 15) and incubated for 24 h. Levels of IRF-3 phosphorylation were assayed
  by western blot. (C) HEK-Blue assay measuring secreted IFNα/β from each cell line
  6 h after transfection with 100 ng/ml of 3p-hpRNA. The means and SDs of three independent
  experiments are shown. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey's post-test. (D) HEK293 cell lines expressing significantly lower levels
  of RIG-I were transfected with 100 ng/ml of the IAV-derived synthetic RNA 3p-hpRNA
  or dephosphorylated form of 3p-hpRNA and incubated for 6 h. Levels of IRF-3 phosphorylation
  were assayed by western blot. (E) Dual-luciferase assay measuring induction of the
  IFNβ promoter in each cell line 24 h after transfection with 100 ng/ml of 3p-hpRNA.
  Renilla luciferase was used as a loading and transfection control. The means and
  SDs of three independent experiments are shown. Statistical significance was calculated
  using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test.
