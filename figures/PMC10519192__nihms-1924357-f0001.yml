caption: 'A. Hypothesized mechanism of eif3c mutant mouse anterior polydactyly phenotype,
  based on . A housekeeping (orange) or Patched1 (blue) transcript, with the eIF3
  complex with small ribosomal subunit, being translated in wild type (top) or eif3c
  heterozygous mutant (bottom) mice. Magenta sequence is the pyrimidine-rich sequence
  identified in the Ptch1 5’UTR. The authors propose that eif3c binds to UC-rich motifs
  in the Ptch1 5’UTR as part of the eIF3 complex;heterozygous eif3c mutants show reduced
  PTCH1 translation, leading to reduced inhibition of SHH signaling (purple gradient)
  and subsequent posteriorization of a developing hand.B, C. We envision two possible
  models: one where eIF3c specifically controls translation of different SHH pathway
  components, partly through UC-rich motifs (magenta) (B), and an alternative model
  where the phenotypes observed are caused by a broader change in translation of many
  genes where some of the affected genes have a prominent dosage effect in development
  causing a specific phenotype (C).'
