caption: '(A) Schematics show that simultaneous activation of the CSF1R pathway and
  the CD47-SIRPα pathway by cancer cells resulting in M2 polarized protumorigenic
  macrophages. (B) Schematics show deterministic co-delivery of DNTs to the M2 polarized
  macrophage leads to concurrent inhibition of CSF1R and SHP2, which results in repolarization
  of macrophages to an antitumorigenic M1 phenotype while simultaneously increasing
  the phagocytic index. Adapted with permission from , copyright 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag

  and pIL-12 plasmids. (D) Schematic illustration of MMP2/9 response and CPP-mediated
  tumor targeting of HPT-PF NPs, and IL-12 production and Cas9/sgRNA complexes-induced
  CD47 knockout by the transfection of Cas9/sgRNA and pIL-12 plasmids in melanoma
  cells. (E) Schematics show that the combination of CD47 blockade with IL-12 production
  synergistically promotes the M1-polarized TAMs for enhanced phagocytosis and secretion
  of inflammatory factors to elicit TAM-mediated immunotherapy. Adapted with permission
