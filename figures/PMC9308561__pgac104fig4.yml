caption: Succeptibility of human cancer cells with oncogenic BRAF or KRAS mutation
  to the MEK inhibition by LF-W271A. (A) Cancer cells with the BRAFV600E mutation
  but not the oncogenic RAS mutations are more sensitive to the MEK inhibition by
  LF-W271A/PA. Cancer cells with the indicated mutations were incubated with various
  concentrations of LF-W271A in the presence of 500 ng/mL PA for 72 h, followed by
  an MTT assay for assessing cell viability. Means ± SD. (B) Signal transduction pathways
  driven by the oncogenic RAS and BRAF. Oncogenic RAS proteins can drive both the
  MEK–ERK and PI3K effector pathways for cell proliferation. Therefore, under the
  MEK–ERK inhibition, the cells with oncogenic RAS mutations may still survive via
  the PI3K pathway signaling. (C) Cells were incubated with various concentrations
  of LF/PA or LF-W271A/PA for 3 h, followed by western blotting using anti-MEK2 or
  anti-Phospho-ERK (T202/Y204) antibody to evaluate activation status of ERK pathway.
  (D) Synergistic or additive cytotoxic effect of LF-W271A/PA and BEZ235 to a set
  of human cancer cells. Cells were treated with LF-W271A/PA/(1 nM = 85 ng/mL each
  of LF-W271A and PA), BEZ235 (30 nM), or their combination for 48 h, followed by
  an MTT assay to assess cell viability. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.
