caption: Characterization of the morphology and surface chemistry nanoparticles of
  fullerenol and roughness of nanofilm using transmission electron microscopy ((A);
  scale bar is 200 nm), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (B) and atomic force
  microscopy (C). (C) Comparison of the topography between an ordinary polystyrene
  plate (control; the scale bar is 10 µm × 10 µm × 41 nm) and a polystyrene plate
  coated with fullerenol (C60(OH)40; the scale bar is 10 µm × 10 µm × 34 nm). The
  figure shows a two-dimensional image (left side), a three-dimensional image (center),
  and height profiles of fullerenol (right side).
