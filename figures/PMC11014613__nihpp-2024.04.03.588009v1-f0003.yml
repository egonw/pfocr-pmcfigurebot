figure_title: Gene expression profiling in LFS-BC compared to early onset nonLFS-BC
caption: '(a) Volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LFS-BC
  compared to normal LFS breast tissue. (b) Volcano plot showing DEGs in nonLFS-BC
  compared to normal breast tissue. (c) Differential expression of canonical p53 targets
  in the indicated tumor types (LFS-BC, early onset nonLFS-BC, TCGA ER+Her2− nonLFS-BC
  stratified by somatic TP53 mutation status, TCGA HER2+BC nonLFS-BC stratified by
  somatic TP53 mutation status, and TCGA non-LFS TNBC stratified by somatic TP53 mutation
  status) compared to normal breast tissue. (d) Volcano plot showing DEGs in LFS-BC
  compared to early-onset nonLFS-BC. (e) Hallmark pathways significantly differentially
  regulated between LFS-BC and nonLFS-BC. (f) Log2 fold change (FC) of significantly
  regulated genes in these pathways in LFS-BC compared to nonLFS-BC. (g) Normalized
  enrichment scores for Hallmark pathways in differential gene expression analyses
  between LFS-BC, nonLFS-BC and TCGA ER+, Her2+ and TNBC, each stratified by somatic
  p53 mutation status and each group compared to breast tissue normal. Pathways shown
  were significantly enriched in at least one comparison, non-significantly enriched
  pathways are indicated by “ns”; red arrow indicates pathway significantly regulated
  in all comparisons except LFS-BC versus normal. (h) Log2 fold change (FC) of significantly
  regulated genes in MYC targets pathway in indicated tumor type compared to normal
  breast tissue. Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; DEG, differentially expressed genes;
  ER, Estrogen receptor; FC, fold change; FDR, false discovery rate; HER2: receptor
  tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2; LFS, Li Fraumeni Syndrome; p53Mut, positive for
  somatic TP53 mutation; p53WT, negative for somatic TP53 mutation; TNBC, triple negative
  breast cancer.'
