caption: 'Effect of lncRNA MEG3 on the M1 polarization of microglia by influencing
  the NF‐κB signaling pathway. BV2 cells transfected with pcDNA‐MEG3 were treated
  with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, NF‐κB signaling pathway activator) and then
  treated the cells with LPS for 24 h. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis was conducted
  to detect the expressions of ED‐1 and iNOS (scale bar: 5 μm). (B) Western blot was
  performed to quantify the protein levels of NF‐κB signaling pathway‐related molecules
  p50, p65, and p‐p65. (C) Western blot was performed to measure the protein levels
  of ED‐1 and iNOS. (D) ELISA was performed to measure the concentrations of TNF‐α,
  IL‐6, and IL‐1β. (E) pcDNA‐MEG3 and/or si‐A20 was transfected into BV2 cells and
  primary microglia. qRT‐PCR and Western blot were applied to test the mRNA and protein
  levels of A20 (an inhibitor of the NF‐κB signaling pathway). (F) Western blot was
  conducted to measure the protein levels of p50, p65, and p‐p65. *P < 0.05 vs. LPS + pcDNA,
  LPS + pcDNA‐MEG3, pcDNA, or pcDNA‐MEG3 + si‐control. PMA, phorbol myristate acetate.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SD of three independent assays'
