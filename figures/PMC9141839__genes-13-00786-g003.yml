caption: ESD improved p53 level by JAB1 and inhibited the interaction between JAB1
  and p53. (A–C) Cells were transfected with scramble siRNA (scramble) or siRNA-JAB1
  (siJAB1) for 24 h. The protein level of JAB1 was analyzed by Western blot, and the
  relative protein level of JAB1 was calculated as the ratio of JAB1 to ACTB. (D,E)
  Western blot analysis of p53 in A549 cells transfected with 60 nM scramble siRNA
  (scramble) or siRNA-JAB1 (siJAB1) for 24 h before exposure to 5, 10 μM FPD5 for
  24 h. Relative protein level of p53 calculated as ratio of p53 to ACTB. (F,G) Co-immunoprecipitation
  (Co-IP) of JAB1 with the p53 protein in A549 cells. Data are mean  ± SEM. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p< 0.001, N.S., not significant, n = 3.
