caption: Effect of taurine on the transcriptional activity of the TXNIP promoter between
  −1299/+256. Caco-2 cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing partial
  promoter regions of TXNIP and then replaced with a medium containing 100 mM of taurine.
  After 24 h, the cells were subjected to a luciferase assay, as described in Materials
  and Methods . (A) TXNIP promoter partial sequences (−1299/+256, −109/+256, −39/+256).
  Results are expressed as relative values with the control value of (−1299/+256)
  as 1. (B) TXNIP promoter partial sequences (−29/+256, −29/+142, −39/+65). Results
  are expressed as relative values with the control value of −39/+256 as 1. Each value
  represents the mean ± S.E. (n = 3), * p < 0.05, vs. the control value (Student’s
  t-test).
