caption: PTUPB inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by promoting Sirt1 expression.
  The mTOR protein and its phosphorylation level in the liver were measured by Western
  blot and quantitatively analyzed ((A–C), n = 6). Cells were treated with PTUPB (1
  μM) for 1 h before treatment with PA (200 µM). The levels of p-mTOR, p-AKT, and
  p-PI3K in AML12 cells were measured by Western blot and quantitatively analyzed
  after PA stimulation for 30 min ((D–G), n = 3). Cells were treated with PTUPB (1
  μM) or EX527 (10 μM) for 1 h before treatment with PA (200 µM). The levels of p-mTOR,
  p-AKT, and p-PI3K in AML12 cells were measured by Western blot and quantitatively
  analyzed after PA stimulation for 30 min ((H–K), n = 3). Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD. Differences among multiple groups were performed using ANOVA. Tukey’s
  test was used as a post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001.
