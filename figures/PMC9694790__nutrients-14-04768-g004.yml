caption: Pathway underlying the anti-tumor and anti-cancer effects of fucoxanthin
  (FX). FX achieves its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting inflammatory pathways such
  as NF-κB, MAPK, JAK-STAT, and PI3K/AKT. The expression level of GADD45α and the
  BAX/BCL2 ratio increased, and the expression of related cell cycle proteins, such
  as CDK2/4/6, Bcl-2, XIAP, and CIAP1/2, decreased after the related inflammatory
  pathways were inhibited by FX, which led to the regulation of apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest, thus controlling tumor and cancer development and progression.
