caption: 'Inhibitory effects of CF on the IL-1β induced MAPK signaling pathway in
  primary chondrocyte. Primary chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL)
  with different concentrations of CF (0, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL) for 30 min. (A)
  The protein expression of ERK, JNK, and p38 was assessed by western blot analysis
  and (B) quantification analysis. ** p < 0.01 and **** p < 0.0001 vs. the control
  group, # p < 0.05 and #### p < 0.0001 vs. the IL-1β treated group.'
