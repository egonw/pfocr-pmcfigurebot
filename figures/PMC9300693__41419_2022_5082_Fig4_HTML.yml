figure_title: Thiostrepton-induced ferroptosis depends on the STAT3–GPX4 signalling
  pathway
caption: A qRT–PCR analysis of GPX4 mRNA expression. B Western blotting analysis of
  STAT3, p-STAT3 and GPX4 levels in Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3 cells receiving
  different treatments (DMSO, TST, and TST + STAT3). C OD value of the CCK-8 assay
  was conducted at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h using pancreatic cancer cells from different
  treatment groups. D and E Clone formation ability and number of pancreatic cancer
  cells receiving different treatments. F, G, H ROS, MDA and GSH-PX levels were detected
  in Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3 cells from the different treatment groups (*P < 0.05
  and **P < 0.01).
