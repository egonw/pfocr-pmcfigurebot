caption: The biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid at different developmental
  stages. (A) The biosynthesis pathway of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid was produced
  according to the KEGG database. (B) The heat map of genes associated with terpenoid
  backbone, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis based on their expression
  level. (C) The expression of DaAACT, DaHMGCS, DaHMGCR, DaGPPS, DaSE, DaSE1, DaDS-1,DaDS-2,
  DaAFS in the pathway of A during root development. The values are the means ± SD;
  n = 3. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test compared with
  L1. **, P < 0.01. AACT, Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; SE, squalene epoxidase; DS,
  dammarenediol synthase; AFS, alpha-farnesene synthase.
