caption: 'Effects of different types of treatments versus no treatment on the proliferation,
  migration, and invasion of PC-9 and A549 cells. (a) Proliferation of the cells at
  indicated time points under different treatments of UBE, UBE combined with PEM,
  and no treatment via MTT. (b) Invasion and (c) migration of the cells after 24 hours
  under different treatments of UBE, UBE combined with PEM, and no treatment. ∗P <
  0.05 for comparison between the treatment groups and the sham group; #P < 0.05 for
  comparison between the 1 mg/ml UBE group and the UBE + PEM group.'
