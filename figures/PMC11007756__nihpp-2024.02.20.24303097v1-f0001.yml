figure_title: ACOD1 is induced after TLR7 activation in BMDM
caption: a) Western blot showing ACOD1 protein expression in WT and Acod1−/− BMDM
  treated with imiquimod (1 μg/mL) at 0, 3, 12 and 24 hours. b) Western blot showing
  ACOD1 protein expression evaluated in WT, Acod1−/−, and Ifnar1−/− BMDM treated in
  vitro with imiquimod (1 ug/mL) for 0, 12 and 24 hours. RNA seq was performed in
  BMDM treated with IMQ for 12h. c) Heatmap representation of the genes induced in
  BMDM after 12h of IMQ stimulation. d) Gene ontology analysis of genes differentially
  expressed between control BMDM and IMQ treated BMDM. e) Heatmap representation of
  the genes associated to metabolic pathways in BMDM after 12h of IMQ stimulation.
  RNA-seq data was analyzed with DESeq2. The log-transformed DESeq2-normalized read
  counts were further scaled for each gene individually using the mean expression
  levels and their corresponding standard deviations to facilitate visualization in
  a heatmap. Three blots were processed in parallel for a and b, n = 3. Six independent
  mice were chosen from each genotype for c, d, and e. n = 6.
