figure_title: NAD+ redox balance, consumption and synthesis
caption: 'Redox turnover of NAD+ is essential for substrate catabolism, e.g. glycolysis
  (green). NAD+ is consumed as a substrate by Sirtuins, Parps and NAD+ hydrolases,
  yielding NAM and an ADPR moiety. These NAD+-consuming enzymes regulate PTMs of proteins,
  NAD+ levels and cellular functions. NAD+ is synthesized through three pathways-
  the de novo pathway (blue), the Preiss-Handler Pathway (yellow) and the salvage
  pathway (orange). De novo NAD+synthesis starts with IDO, mediating the rate-limiting
  step with the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkin. After several enzymatic reactions,
  the intermediate, ACMS, undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form QA, which is the
  second rate-limiting step. ACMS can be further metabolized to AMS by ACMSD and enter
  TCA cycle. Inhibition of ACMSD is reported to elevate NAD+ levels by directing ACMS
  to NAD+synthesis via QA. QA is converted to NAMN by QPRT using PRPP as a co-substrate.
  In the Preiss-Handler pathway, NA is metabolized to NAMN by NAPRT. The de novo and
  Preiss–Handler pathways converge at NAMN, which is further metabolized into NAAD
  by NMNATs at the expense of ATP. NAD+ is synthesized from NAAD under the catalysis
  of NADS. NAM from NAD+ consumption and NR from diet serve as NAD+ precursors for
  the salvage pathway, in which NAM and NR are converted into a common product, NMN,
  by NAMPT or NMRK, respectively. NMN is converted into NAD+ by NMNAT, the same enzymes
  used in the Preiss-Handler pathways.Abbreviations: poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (Parps),
