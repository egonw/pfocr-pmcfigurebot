caption: The disturbed metabolic pathways when comparing the NSCLC cases versus cancer-free
  controls. Various metabolism changes before a diagnosis with NSCLC was manifested
  (the p-value was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution; fold enrichment
  was calculated based on the total number of metabolites mapped into the biochemical
  pathway; and the total number of compounds in the involved pathway).
