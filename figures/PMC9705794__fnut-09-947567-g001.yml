caption: Effects of ketogenic diet and ketone body supplementation and downstream
  metabolism, exemplified for skeletal muscle. The liver produces ketone bodies during
  fasting, starvation, in carbohydrate restriction, or prolonged intense exercise.
  These ketone bodies can be used for input in the TCA cycle in various tissues, including
  the muscle to generate ATP. The Cori cycle, also known as lactic acid cycle, is
  the pathway in which lactate is transported to the liver and converted into glucose.
  Glucose-alanine cycle is the pathway in which alanine is transported to the liver
  and converted into glucose. KB, ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid/acetoacetate, acetone
  and beta-hydroxybutyric acid); TG, triglycerides; FFA, free fatty acids; Acetyl
  CoA, Acetyl coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.
