caption: Gene and relative protein expression levels of hedgehog signaling pathway.
  (A) Effect of ornidazole on hedgehog signaling pathway in unsorted, CD133+, and
  CD133- cells was assessed with real time-polymerase chain reaction. Tumor cells
  were isolated from mice. Each group was compared with the control group. Data are
  shown as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments (one-way ANOVA
  with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons, *** P < 0.001, ** P < 0.01
  (n = 6/group). (B) The fold-change levels of protein expression in ELISA assay of
  the B16F10 cells treated with ornidazole. The experiments were performed in duplicate.
  Each group was compared with the control group. Results are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation of three independent experiments (two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni testing
  for multiple comparisons, *** P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, n = 6 per group). Shh – Sonic
  hedgehog, PTCH1 – patched-1, SMO – smoothened, GLI1 – glioma-associated oncogene
  homologue-1, CD133 – also known as AC133 and prominin-1.
