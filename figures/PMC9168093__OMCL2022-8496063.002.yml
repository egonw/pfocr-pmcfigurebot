caption: The effect of PGZ on lifespan extension depends on the IIS pathway. (a–d)
  Lifespan analyses of nhr-49(gk405) (a), daf-2(e1370) (b), akt-1(mg144) (c), and
  daf-16(mu86) (d) mutant worms treated with or without 0.5 mM PGZ (p value by the
  log-rank test). (e) mRNA levels of daf-16 target genes (sod-1, sod-3, ctl-1, and
  dod-3) in WT animals with or without PGZ treatment (means ± SD; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05
  and ∗∗p < 0.01; Student's t-test). (f) Western blot analyses of SOD-3p::GFP in worms
  treated with or without 0.5 mM PGZ. Actin was shown as the loading control. (g)
  Imaging of fluorescence in the transgenic strain CF1553 (SOD-3p::GFP) (representative
  of three experiments) and (h) respective quantitative results for at least 30 worms
  per condition (means ± SD; n ≥ 30; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; Student's t-test).
