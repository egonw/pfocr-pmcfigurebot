caption: 'GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and PPI analysis of the 42 differentially
  expressed genes. Categories and two most enriched terms: Biological processes (A,
  myeloid cell development and erythrocyte development), cellular components (B, hemoglobin
  complex, haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex) molecular function (C, haptoglobin binding,
  oxygen binding), and pathway enrichment (D, antigen processing and presentation,
  asthma). In the PPI analysis (E), yellow and purple represent globin, green represents
  immunity-related GTPase-like, blue represents antigen processing and presentation,
  and red represents major histocompatibility complex class II.'
