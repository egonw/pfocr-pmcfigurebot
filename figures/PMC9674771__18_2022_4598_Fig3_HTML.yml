caption: Caspase-8 interactome. 291 differentially expressed proteins with a Log2
  FC ≥  + 0.5 (up-regulated), representing the pool of potentially Caspase-8 interacting
  proteins, were identified through the comparative analysis of HeLa WT non-synchronized
  (NS) and S/G2-phase synchronized (synch.) data sets. They were analyzed for their
  cellular functions using A the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tool.
  The top 20 most significantly regulated pathways are shown here, predicted by IPA.
  The black bars represent cancer cell-migration associated functions; and B the DAVID
  bioinformatics tool (www.david.ncifcrf.gov, v.6.8). Shown here are the top 15 most
  significant processes, predicted using the Gene Ontology Term (GOTERM) “Biological
  Process (BP)” function of DAVID. The black bars represent cancer cell-migration-associated
  processes. C The 291 proteins predicted by IPA to be associated with cell-migration
  were further analyzed by IPA to determine whether these proteins, including Caspase-8,
  were directly involved with cell-migration or indirectly, via other proteins, which
  may or may not be present in our data-set of 291 proteins. The black arrow highlights
  Caspase-8. D The “Diseases and Functions” feature of the IPA tool also predicted
  that the cell-migration-associated proteins were also involved in several other
  biological processes. Shown here are the top 10 processes regulated by these proteins
  and their associations with Caspase-8. E The proteins involved in both cell-migration
  and transcription were further analyzed using IPA to determine whether Caspase-8
  could directly or indirectly interact with them. The black and red arrows highlight
  Caspase-8 and CDK9, respectively. The interactome analysis was performed in triplicate
