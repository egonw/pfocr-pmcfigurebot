caption: PF suppresses the activation of the downstream NF-κB signaling pathway in
  vitro. (a) Expressions of NF-κB mRNA in cells were determined by real-time PCR.
  Splenocytes of MRL/MP, splenocytes of MRL/lpr, and spleen CD4+ T lymphocytes of
  MRL/lpr were treated with 10 μg/mL LPS either alone or with 50 μmol/L PF for 24 h.
  (b) Levels of IKKα/β, p-IKKα/β, IκBα, p-IκBα, NF-κB, and p-NF-κB protein expression
  in cells were determined by Western Blot. The protein bands of IKKα/β, p-IKKα/β,
  IκBα, p-IκBα, NF-κB, and p-NF-κB and quantitative analysis of protein expression
  alteration in splenocytes of MRL/MP, splenocytes of MRL/lpr, and spleen CD4+ T lymphocytes
  of MRL/lpr were showed. Cells in the control group were treated with vehicle (1640
  with 10% FBS). The results were shown as mean ± S.D (n = 3). ∗ and ∗∗ indicated
  significant differences at the levels of p < 0.05 and p < 0.01.
