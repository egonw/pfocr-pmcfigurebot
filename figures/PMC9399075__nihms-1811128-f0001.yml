caption: 'Intracellular and intestinal ceramide metabolism. (a) Sphingolipids are
  metabolized in various subcellular compartments. Ceramides are produced via a de
  novo biosynthetic pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported
  to the Golgi apparatus for synthesis of complex sphingolipids. Ceramide can be regenerated
  from SM hydrolysis in the mitochondria, lysosome, plasma membrane, and circulating
  lipoproteins. Deacylation of ceramides generates sphingosine, which can be phosphorylated
  to form S1P. (b) Dietary SM and ceramide are digested in the small intestine by
  alk-SMase and nCDase, respectively, to form sphingosine, which is absorbed by enterocytes.
  In the large intestine, dietary and de novo sphingolipids are metabolized by gut
  microbiota to generate unique odd-chain and deoxysphingolipid species. Abbreviations:
