caption: '(a) Schematic representation of the HGA producing pathway engineered in
  Y. lipolytica. Green arrows, overexpressed steps. Red arrows, inactivated reactions.
  Purple arrows, enzymatic reactions thought to be encoded by two other ORFs in the
  Y. lipolytica HGA degradation cluster. Genes encoding corresponding enzymatic steps
  are shown next to the reactions. Metabolites are shortened as follows: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; DHQ,
  3-dehydroquinate; DHS, 3-dehydro-shikimate; SHIK, shikimate; SHP, shikimate-3-phosphate;
  EP3P, 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate; CHA, chorismate; PPA, prephenate; HPP,
  para-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate; PPY, phenylpyruvate; MAA, 4-maleyl-acetoacetate; FAA,
  4-fumaryl-acetoacetate; FUM, fumarate; AAÐ¡, acetoacetate; Tyr, L-tyrosine; Phe,
  L-phenylalanine. (b) Summary of modifications introduced in HGA producing strains.
  The symbols of delta and up arrow are used to indicate deletion and overexpression
  respectively of corresponding genes. (c) Accumulation of HGA by engineered strains
  after 14-day cultivation in YNB medium with 9% glucose. Standard deviations were
  estimated based two biological replicates. (d) Visible accumulation of pyomelanin
  by engineered strains in the cultural broth after 7-day cultivation in the YNB medium
  with 2% citrate.'
