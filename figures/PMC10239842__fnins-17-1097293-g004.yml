caption: Enrichment analysis of necroptosis-related genes in PD samples. (A) GO enrichment
  analysis. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis. (C–G) Five up-regulated pathways were significantly
  enriched in cluster2 vs. cluster1. (H–L) Five down-regulated pathways were significantly
  enriched in cluster2 vs. cluster1 by GSEA enrichment analysis. (M) Pathway entries
  were significantly enriched in cluster1 and cluster2 by GSVA enrichment analysis.
