figure_title: Human ALL cell lines are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition of
  the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway
caption: Titration curves for human leukemia cells cultured with increasing concentrations
  of (A) torin-1, (B) capivasertib and (C) everolimus. Viable cells were counted with
  trypan blue exclusion assay after four days. Data represent mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments. D Graph shows means of half inhibitory growth concentration
  (IC50) of three independent experiments. E Titration curves of torin-1 for colony
  forming assay using murine E2A-PBX1+/PreBCR+ leukemia cells. Data represent mean ± SEM
  of three independent experiments. CFU, colony forming units. F Kaplan–meier curve
  represent disease-free survival of recipient mice transplanted with murine E2A-PBX1+/PreBCR+
  leukemia cells after sublethal irradiation and treatment with vehicle or torin-1
  (20 mg/kg b.w./d) starting at day 8 after transplantation. Each cohort contains
  5 mice. Statistical analysis was performed by log-rank test.
