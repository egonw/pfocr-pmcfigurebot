caption: Overexpression of miR-29b inhibits the growth of NSCLC cells. (a) miR-29b
  expression was increased significantly after overexpression of miR-29b. (b) miR-29b
  inhibited the proliferation of A549 and NCI-H1792 cells. (c) miR-29b inhibited the
  formation of A549 and NCI-H-1792 cell clones. (d) miR-29b inhibited A549 and NCI-H-1792
  cell invasion. (e) miR-29b inhibited A549 and NCI-H-1792 cell migration. (f) miR-29b
  promoted the apoptosis of A549 and NCI-H1792 cells. (g) miR-29b promotes apoptosis
  of A549 and nci-h1792 cells in G0-G1 phase. ∗P ≤ 0.05, comparison between the miR-29b
  group and miR-NC group.
