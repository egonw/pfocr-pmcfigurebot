caption: HSP90AA1 over-expression does not promote the expressions of ISGs and IFN-α
  under CSFV Infection. (A, B) Relative mRNA levels of ISGs and IFN-α in PK-15 and
  3D4/2 cells were determined by RT-PCR. Cells were transfected with p3×Flag-HSP90AA1
  first and then infected with CSFV (MOI=1). Cells were harvested at 24hpi and 48hpi.
  Total cellular RNA was extracted to determine relative mRNA expression levels of
  ISGs and IFN-α. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001 calculated
  using two-way ANOVA, ns, not significant).
article_title: HSP90AA1 interacts with CSFV NS5A protein and regulates CSFV replication
  via the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
