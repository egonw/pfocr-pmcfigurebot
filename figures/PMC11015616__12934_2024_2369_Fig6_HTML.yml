caption: DEGs analysis of untreated and IBC-treated C. neoformans cells using RNA-seq
  analysis. RNA-seq analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from three replicate
  samples for each biological group. (A) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed
  to identify the most significantly enriched pathways at a threshold Padjust of ≤ 0.05.
  (B) Scatter plot of KEGG enrichment of DEGs. The abscissa Rich factor indicates
  the number of DEGs located in the KEGG/the total number of genes located in the
  KEGG metabolic pathway
