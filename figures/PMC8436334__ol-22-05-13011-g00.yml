caption: Anticarcinogenic mechanism of artesunate. Multiple molecular and signaling
  pathways regulate abnormal cell proliferation and migration, such as the NF-ÎºB signaling
  pathway, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  among others, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis. Artesunate may affect the development
  of cancer by interfering with the cell cycle, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis
  and apoptosis of cancer cells by acting on different sites. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition.
