caption: Correlation between SCFAs and heart failure. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
  inhibit intestinal and systemic inflammation by binding to G-protein receptor 43
  (GPR43), G-protein receptor 109A (GPR109A) and G-protein receptor 41 (GPR41) on
  the surface of a variety of cells. The secretion of pro-inflammatory factors decreased
  while anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-22 increased. Moreover, the nuclear transcription
  factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and immune cells are also involved in the
  anti-inflammatory process of SCFAs. Apart from this, SCFAs can also enhance myocardial
  energy metabolism, maintain metabolic homeostasis, and play a cardioprotective role.
