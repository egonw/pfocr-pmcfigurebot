figure_title: ADAM15 affects the EGFR signalling pathway through integrin α3/α6
caption: A Control and ADAM15-overexpressing stable A549 cells were treated with the
  indicated siRNA (si-α3/α6 compared with si-NC) followed by western blotting. β-actin
  was used as a loading control. B, C Control and ADAM15-overexpressing stable A549
  cells were treated with the indicated siRNA (si-α3//α6 compared with si-NC), followed
  by CCK8 and Transwell assays. D Co-immunoprecipitation of ADAM15 and integrin α3/α6
  is shown. Protein was immunoprecipitated and detected from parental A549 and H1299
  cells using a specific monoclonal antibody. E Co-immunoprecipitation of ADAM15 and
  integrins were shown, protein were immunoprecipitation from lysates of control and
  CD151 knockdown H1299 cells using a specific monoclonal antibody. F The Flag-tagged
  ADAM15 vector and HA-tagged CD151 vector were cotransfected into A549 and H1299
  cells for 48 h. The protein were immunoprecipitated using agarose beads with anti-Flag
  antibody. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. G Schematic illustration of the functional
  roles of ADAM15, CD151 and integrin complexes in NSCLC.
