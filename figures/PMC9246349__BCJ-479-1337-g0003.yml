figure_title: AOX is a naturally evolved stress response gene that restores electron
  flux through the ETC when the canonical pathway is blocked
caption: By facilitating a bypass of the canonical ETC, it enables oxygen consumption
  and heat production, prevents mitochondrial ROS production, indirectly supports
  ATP generation by OXPHOS, and maintains cellular redox balance and TCA cycle turnover.
  Plants, fungi and other natural hosts use AOX to increase their metabolic flexibility
  and stress resistance. Pathogens utilize AOX to increase pathogenicity. Since a
  number of human diseases are based on ETC impairment, it has been proposed that
  xenotopic expression of AOX can be used as a therapeutic in human diseases to eventually
  alleviate disease-related side effects.
