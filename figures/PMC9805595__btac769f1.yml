caption: Functional pathway inference analysis identifies components of proliferative
  signalling pathways. (A) Illustration of the FPIA approach, showing gene dependencies
  (left) or gene expression (RNAseq, right) significantly associated to those for
  PIK3CA across cancer cell lines. (B) Over-representation analysis of PIK3CA significant
  correlations from RNAi (top) and RNAseq (bottom) data. (C) Quantile–quantile plots
  of FPIA performed on RNAi data following Fisher z-transformation of r-value in which
  the target genes (shown in graph headers) that possessed means (shown as horizontal
  lines) of significant correlations belonging to the pathway hsa04151 as being significantly
  greater than those of other pathways, ranked by t-test P-value; ** P < 0.01, * P < 0.05
