caption: 'Transcriptome profiles of GIL-6, GIO-6, and IC7 differ from natural cytokines.A,
  venn diagram shows an overlap of genes that are overexpressed following natural
  or synthetic cytokine stimulation of Ba/F3 cells expressing gp130, LIFR, and IL-6R.
  Filter: adjusted p < 0.05 including false discovery rate correction; |FC| >=1.5.
  B, heat map shows genes that are significantly increased by IC7, GIL-6, GIO-6, IL-6,
  or LIF versus untreated Ba/F3 cells expressing gp130, LIFR, and IL-6R. Scale bar
  shows log fold change. Filter: adjusted p < 0.05 including false discovery rate
  correction; |FC| >=1.5. C, gene ontology analysis of common gene pathways that are
  activated following stimulation of Ba/F3 cells expressing gp130, LIFR, and IL-6R
  following stimulation with natural cytokines IL-6, LIF, and synthetic cytokines.
  Filter: adjusted p < 0.05 including false discovery rate correction; |FC| >=1.5.
  X-axis: number of genes involved in common gene pathway.'
