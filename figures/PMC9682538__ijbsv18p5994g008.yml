caption: Recruitment of M2 macrophages in PCa predicts poor prognosis. Tissue immunofluorescence
  triple staining of CD68, CD206 and N1ICD revealed that CD68/CD206/N1ICD expression
  was positively associated with high TNM stage. (B) Cox regression analysis showed
  a significant difference in the CD68/CD206/N1ICD expression status of PCa (p<0.0001).
  (C) Multivariable Cox analysis including prostate cancer-relevant factors (pTNM
  stage) suggested that CD68/CD206/N1ICD expression was an independent marker for
  poor prognosis and that upregulation of N1ICD was associated with poor prognosis.
  (D) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that PCa patients with high CD68/CD206/N1ICD
  expression had the lowest survival rate. (E) Schematic illustration of TAMs directly
  contacting PCa cells.
