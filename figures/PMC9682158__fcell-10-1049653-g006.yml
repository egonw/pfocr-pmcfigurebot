caption: NRKdKO delays the regeneration of injured myofibers which recover through
  compensatory IGF1/AKT signaling. Mice were subjected to unilateral CTX injection
  into hindlimb muscle, tissues were collected 7 and 14 dpi. (A) Representative images
  of TA muscle sections stained with laminin (green) and Hoechst for nuclei (blue)
  at 7 dpi and 14 dpi. Scale bar, 50 µm n = 8. (B) Cumulative distribution of cross-sectional
  area of regenerating fibers with centralized nuclei at 7 dpi and 14 dpi. (C,D) Representative
  immunoblot images (C) and quantification (D) by densitometry analysis of Focal Adhesion
  Kinase (FAK) in WT in NRKdKO muscles, n = 5. (E–I) Representative immunoblot images
  (E) and quantification (F–I) by densitometry analysis of the AKT pathway in WT in
  NRKdKO muscles, n = 5. Results shown are mean ± s. e.m. with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 versus WT, determined by unpaired Student’s t-test
  (D,F–I) or (B) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
