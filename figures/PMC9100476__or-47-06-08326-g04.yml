caption: ICA inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells through the miR-205-5p/PTEN
  axis. The expression of PTEN mRNA was detected by (A) RT-qPCR, (B) CCK-8, (C) colony
  formation assays and (D and E) flow cytometry were used to detect proliferation,
  colony formation, apoptosis and cycle distribution of transfected cells in each
  group. Data are shown as the mean Â± SD of three experiments; *P<0.05. ICA, icariin;
  miR, microRNA; PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten; RT-qPCR,
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; CCK8, Cell Counting Kit-8.

  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
