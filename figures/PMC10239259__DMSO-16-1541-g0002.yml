caption: The possible mechanism of diabetes and sarcopenia. In diabetes, insulin resistance
  inhibits protein synthesis pathways leading to decreased muscle mass. The increase
  of inflammatory cytokines, ROS, Myostatin and Calpain related to diabetes will not
  only inhibit the protein synthesis pathway, but also increase the protein catabolism
  pathway, thereby causing further decline in muscle mass. Hyperglycemia causes decrease
  of WWP1, which leads to increase of KLF15, which further aggravates the protein
  catabolic pathway and leads to muscle atrophy.
