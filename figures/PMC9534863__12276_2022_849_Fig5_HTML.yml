figure_title: CLU inhibits TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 signaling by binding to ALK5
caption: a Immunohistochemical staining of ALK5 in LF tissues from the two groups
  (n = 6). The scale bar indicates 100 μm. b Quantitative analysis of the positive
  cell ratio for ALK5. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. **P < 0.01. c, d Reciprocal
  immunoprecipitation showing the interaction between ALK5 and CLU. LF cells were
  treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h before performing Co-IP analysis. e Representative
  images from the immunofluorescence assay showing the colocalization of ALK5 and
  CLU after treatment with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 using specific antibodies. ALK5 (green),
  CLU (red) and DAPI (blue). The scale bar indicates 50 μm. f Western blot analysis
  showed the effects of ALK5 overexpression on the SMAD3 signaling pathway protein
  levels upon treatment with TGF-β1 and CLU or not. g Effects of siALK5 on the protein
  levels of the SMAD3 signaling pathway upon treatment with TGF-β1 and CLU or not.
