caption: a Five-year mean ALA contents of peony seeds over the course of development.
  DAF days after fertilisation. The samples labelled red had transcriptome sequencing
  data. Data were presented as the mean values ±  SEMs. b Simplified diagram of the
  fatty acid biosynthetic pathway with the designated candidate genes. The heatmaps
  show the candidate gene expression patterns in six stages (35 DAF, 49 DAF, 63 DAF,
  77 DAF, 91 DAF and 119 DAF) from the P. ostii expression profiles. The major genes
  are highlighted in red. c Phylogenetic tree of omega-3 desaturases from P. ostii
  and representative plants showing the subfamilies of FAD3 in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and FAD7/8 in the plastid. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
