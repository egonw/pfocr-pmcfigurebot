caption: Bmi1 was upregulated in high glucose conditions and contributed to the high
  glucose-enhanced aerobic glycolysis in PC cells. (A) In silico analysis demonstrating
  Bmi1 mRNA expression level in normal pancreatic tissue samples (n = 39) and pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma tissue samples (n = 39). (B) Western blot of Bmi1 protein
  in PC cells treated with differential concentrations of glucose for 48 hours. (C)
  Bmi1 mRNA expression in the cells in A. (D) Western blot of Bmi1 protein in PC cells
  transfected with vector or Bmi1 plasmid. (E) Lactate production was measured in
  the supernatant of PC cells transfected with vector or Bmi1 plasmid. (F) Uptake
  of glucose was measured by flow cytometry in PC cells transfected with vector or
  Bmi1 plasmid. (G) Western blot of Bmi1 protein in PC cells transfected with vector
  or Bmi1 plasmid under high glucose or normal conditions. (H) Lactate production
  was measured in the medium of PC cells after transfection with ncRNA or Bmi1 siRNA
  under high glucose or normal conditions. (I) Uptake of glucose was measured by flow
  cytometry in PC cells after transfection with ncRNA or Bmi1 siRNA under high glucose
  or normal conditions. Data presented in the graphs represented means ± standard
  deviation from 3 parallel experiments. ∗∗∗P < .001; ∗∗P < .01; ∗P < .05.
