caption: Hippocampal MAPK and Akt pathway activation 1 or 24 h after infusion of IGF-1
  or IGF-1+Let. Middle-aged female rats were ovariectomized and given an acute infusion
  of Veh, IGF-1, or IGF-1 and IGF-1+Let to the lateral ventricle. Either 1 or 24 h
  later, hippocampi were processed for Western blotting for phosphorylated and total
  levels of p44-MAPK, p42-MAPK, and Akt. Phosphorylated levels were normalized to
  the total protein levels. Graph represents mean D×A ± SEM expressed as a percentage
  of the vehicle group. A–D, One hour after infusion, there was a main effect of treatment
  (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of p44-MAPK (A) and p42-MAPK (B), with post
  hoc testing revealing increased phosphorylation of both MAPK phosphorylation sites
  in the IGF-1 group compared with the Veh group. There was no effect of treatment
  on phosphorylated levels of p44-MAPK (D) or p42-MAPK (E) 24 h after infusion. C,
  One hour after infusion, there was an effect (p < 0.05) of treatment on phosphorylated
  levels of Akt, with post hoc testing revealing increased levels in both the IGF-1
  and IGF-1+Let groups compared with the Veh group. F, There was no effect of treatment
  on phosphorylated levels of Akt 24 h after infusion. *p < 0.05 versus Veh.
