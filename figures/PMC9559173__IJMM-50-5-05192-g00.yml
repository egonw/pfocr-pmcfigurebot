caption: A 12-h incubation with Grifola frondosa polysaccharides (GFPs) at concentrations
  of 50 and 200 µg/ml caused mitochondrial dysfunction in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells.
  (A) The dissipation of ΔΨm was observed detecting by JC-1 staining (x10 magnification;
  scale bar, 100 µm). The experiments were repeated 3 times. (B) GFPs dose-dependently
  reduced the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-extra large (Bcl-xL),
  and enhanced the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8. The average fold
  of band intensity compared to related controls was marked respectively (n=6 repeats
  in each group).
