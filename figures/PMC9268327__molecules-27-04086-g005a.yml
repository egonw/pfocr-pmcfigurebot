caption: Cs-EE inhibited the survival and proliferation of an androgen-dependent prostate
  cancer cell line (LNCaP) and upregulated the survival and proliferation of human
  dermal papilla (HDP) cells. (A) Cell viability assay using MTT solution with different
  Cs-EE concentrations. (B,C) LNCaP proliferation was detected in both the DHT-treated
  and untreated conditions in 0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL of Cs-EE. (D) The cytotoxicity
  of Cs-EE on HDP cells was measured using the MTT assay. (E,F) HDP proliferation
  in different concentrations of Cs-EE was evaluated in the DHT-treated and -untreated
  conditions.
