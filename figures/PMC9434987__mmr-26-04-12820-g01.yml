caption: TRIM22 knockdown inhibits proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of RA-FLSs.
  (A) RA-FLS proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) Cell
  apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. (C) Western blotting was performed
  to assess the protein expression levels of apoptosis-related factors. ***P<0.001
  vs. si-NC. TRIM22, tripartite motif-containing 22; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; FLS,
  fibroblast-like synoviocyte; si, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.
article_title: FOXC1-mediated TRIM22 regulates the excessive proliferation and inflammation
  of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.
