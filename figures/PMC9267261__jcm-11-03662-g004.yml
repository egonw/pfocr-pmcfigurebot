caption: Morusin arrested cell cycle at G1 phase and inhibited cell proliferation
  through the Akt–mTOR–p70S6K pathway. (A,B) Cell-cycle profile of PI-stained cells
  was analyzed by flow cytometry (morusin treatment for 24 h after cell cycle synchronization).
  Quantification of cell cycle following PI staining. n = 3. (C,D) Protein expression
  levels of cyclin D1 and PCNA in U87 and U251 after 24 h morusin treatment (0, 10,
  20 μM) were measured by Western blot. (E) Ki67 (red) was stained by Alexa Fluor
  647 in U87 cells treated with morusin (20 μM, 12 h) or vehicle and analyzed by a
  confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). bar = 50 μm. (F) Quantification
  of the number of ki67 positive cells. (G–J) Down-regulation of Akt–mTOR–P70S6K pathway
  after 24 h morusin treatment (0, 10, 20 μM). Phosphorylation levels of AKT, mTOR
  and P70S6K were compared to total Akt, mTOR and P70S6K, respectively. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.0001 compared to indicated comparator.
