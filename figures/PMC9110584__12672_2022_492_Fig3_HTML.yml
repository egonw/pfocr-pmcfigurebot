caption: CRABP2 upregulation promotes cell oxidative phosphorylation and proliferation. A
  CRABP2 expression pattern in healthy tissues and tumor tissues of the whole-body
  organ. B Western blot was applied to detect CYP4A11 protein level after overexpression
  of CRABP2 in ovarian cancer cells. C CCK8 assay were performed to test cell proliferation
  after overexpression of CRABP2 p inovarian cancer cell line OVCA429 cells and NM
  cells. D GSEA of the pathway activated in CRABP2 upregulated ovarian cancer tumor
  tissues based on transcriptome data
article_title: Exosome-related protein CRABP2 is upregulated in ovarian carcinoma
  and enhances cell proliferation.
