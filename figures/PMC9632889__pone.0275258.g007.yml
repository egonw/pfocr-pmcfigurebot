figure_title: Leonurine reduced the expression of proteins related to pyroptosis in
  H9c2 cells stimulated by TGF-β
caption: '(A) Compared to H9c2 cells induced by TGF-β for 48 hours, leonurine decreased
  the expression of proteins related to pyroptosis including (B) GSDMD, (C) cleaved
  GSDMD, (D) Caspase 1, (E) cleaved Caspase 1, and the level of (F) IL-1β. #P<0.05,
  model group vs. control group; *P<0.05, 20 μM leonurine group vs. model group.'
article_title: Leonurine inhibits cardiomyocyte pyroptosis to attenuate cardiac fibrosis
  via the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway.
