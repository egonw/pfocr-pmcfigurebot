caption: CCK-8 experiment results and the expression of odontogenic/osteogenic genes
  and proteins at different drug concentrations on 14 days. hDPSCs were cultured in
  general medium containing different concentrations of PHT for 14 days. Proteins
  and mRNAs were collected on day 14 after induction for Western blot and qRT-PCR.
  (a) CCK-8 cytotoxicity experiment showed the concentration below 200 mg/L PHT had
  no obvious toxicity to hDPSC. (b) CCK-8 cell proliferation experiment showed that
  the inhibitory effect of hDPSC proliferation increased with the higher PHT concentration.
  (c)–(e) show the expression of DSPP, DMP1, and ALP genes at different drug concentrations
  on 14 days, and related genes were elevated in the 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L PHT concentration.
  (f, g) Western Blot experiment showed the protein expression levels of DSPP and
  DMP1 were significantly upregulated in the 50 mg/L PHT concentration. (h) ALP staining
  showed an increase in the 50 mg/L PHT group on 14 days.
