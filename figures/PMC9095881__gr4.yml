caption: 'Hippocampal cholinergic response to LPS of delayed cohort. Prior to LPS
  administration, there was no effect of a history of PB treatment or repeated restraint
  stress (RRS) on basal ACh levels in the hippocampus (inset). A history of RRS in
  vehicle-treated rats suppressed the cholinergic response to LPS at collection 12,
  but then increased this response at collection 15 compared to vehicle non-stressed
  controls (NSC). A history of PB treatment suppresses the cholinergic response to
  LPS at collection 12 compared to Vehicle-NSC rats. Unlike PB-NSC rats, the combination
  of PB and stress exaggerated the cholinergic response to LPS at collections 12,
  13 and 16, although these increases did not achieve statistical significance. All
  data are expressed as mean + SEM, n = 6–9. [*: Significant effect of PB in NSC rats,
  p < 0.05. #: Significant effect of RRS in vehicle-treated rats, p < 0.05].'
