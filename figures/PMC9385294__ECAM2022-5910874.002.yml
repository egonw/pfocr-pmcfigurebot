caption: Exosomal miR-221-3p inhibited proliferation, migration, and ECM deposition
  in ASMCs. ASMCs were treated with TGF-β1 to induce a proliferation model and then
  incubated with BMSCs-derived exosomes alone or together with transfection with miR-221-3p
  inhibitor. (a) RT-qPCR was performed to measure the expression of miR-221-3p. (b)
  ASMC proliferation was evaluated by using the CCK-8 assay. (c), (d) ASMC migration
  was measured by using Transwell assay. (e)–(g) The protein expression of fibronectin
  and collagen III was analyzed by using western blot analysis. Data from at least
  three independent experiments were presented as mean ± SD ∗P < 0.05.
