caption: Dose-dependent inhibitory effects of CKI on the proliferation, clone formation
  and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells treated
  with different concentrations of CKI for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. (B) Clone
  formation images of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with different concentrations of CKI.
  (C) Wound healing images of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with different concentrations
  of CKI for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. (D) Bar plot showing clone formation
  rates. (E) Bar plot showing wound healing rates. (F) Heatmap of significantly differential
  genes. Top 20 up- and down-regulated genes in the differential genes with base mean
  larger than the median value were shown. (G) Volcano plot of significantly differential
  genes. The red dot represents up-regulated genes (adjusted P < 0.05 and log2FC >
  1) and the green dot represents down-regulated genes (adjusted P < 0.05 and log2FC
  < -1). Top 10 up- and down-regulated differential genes were labeled. (H) GSEA analysis
  of genes involved in MYC targets variant 2 pathway. (I) GSEA analysis of genes involved
  in E2F targets pathway. (J) GSEA analysis of genes involved in MYC targets variant
  1 pathway. (K) GSEA analysis of genes involved in G2M checkpoint pathway. Data represents
  mean ± SD (n=3 per group). *0.01 < P < 0.05, **0.001 < P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ns,
  non-significant.
