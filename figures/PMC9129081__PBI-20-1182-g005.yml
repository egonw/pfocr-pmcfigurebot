caption: The biosynthesis pathways of pigments. (a) Proposed synthesis pathway of
  anthocyanins and flavonols. (b) Proposed synthesis pathway of xanthophylls and carotenes.
  Phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase (PAL), cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase (C4H), 4‐coumarate CoA
  ligase 4 (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3‐hydroxylase
  (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4‐reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), acyltransferase
  (AT), glucosyltransferase (GT), flavonol synthase (FLS). phytoene synthase (PSY),
  phytoene desaturase (PDS), carotene isomerase (CRTISO), lycopene β‐cyclase (LCYB),
  lycopene ε‐cyclase (LCYE), cytochrome P450 carotene β‐hydroxylase (CYP97A), cytochrome
  P450 carotene ε‐hydroxylase (CYP97C), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), violaxanthin de‐epoxidase
  (VDE), and neoxanthin synthase (NXS). Gene expression profile (FPKM) at different
  stages. Low to high expression is indicated by a change in color from blue (low
  accumulation) to red (high accumulation).
