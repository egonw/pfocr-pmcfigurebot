caption: 'Rg1 regulates NLRP3 and IL-1β through p38 MAPK signaling in IPEC-J2 cells
  treated with LPS in vitro. PEC-J2 cells were treated with vehicle, LPS (2 μg/mL),
  SB203580 (10 μM), and Rg1 (60 μM) for 48 h. (A) mRNA level analyses of NLRP3 and
  IL-1β; (B) Western blot analyses of NLRP3 and IL-1β. β-Actin was used as an invariant
  control for equal loading. Blots are representative of three independent experiments
  with densitometry showing the mean ± s.d. ** p < 0.01 versus control. ## p < 0.01
  versus LPS.'
