caption: Silencing of KLF2 expression reverses the protective effects of PTP1B knockdown
  on ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by regulating the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. (A) Tubule-formation
  capacity was measured by endothelial tube formation assay. Magnification, x40. (B)
  Protein expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3 and VEGFA
  were measured using western blotting assay. (C) Protein levels of p-AMPK, AMPK and
  SIRT1 were measured using western blotting. Results represent the mean Â± SD. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. KLF2, Kruppel-like factor 2; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase
  1B; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; NC, negative control; sh, short hairpin;
  VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A; p-, phosphorylated; AMPK, 5'AMP-activated
  protein kinase; SIRT1, sirtuin 1.
article_title: PTP1B inhibition ameliorates inflammatory injury and dysfunction in
  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
