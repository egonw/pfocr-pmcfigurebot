caption: The cobalamin biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms. (A) 5-aminolevulinic
  acid (ALA) synthesis is divided into C4 and C5 pathways according to different sources.
  The intermediate product, uroporphyrinogen III (Uro III) branches to produce porphyrins,
  such as chlorophyll and heme. Differences between aerobic and anaerobic pathways
  are primarily characterized by the insertion time of Co2+ and oxygen. The red dotted
  box showed the aerobic biosynthetic pathway and the blue dotted box showed the anaerobic
  biosynthetic pathway.
