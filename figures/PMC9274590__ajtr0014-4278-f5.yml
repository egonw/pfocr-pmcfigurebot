caption: 'RAGE inhibition improved intestinal tissue injury and downregulated TLR4
  and NF-κBp65 expression. (A) Representative HE staining images showing pathological
  changes in ileum and colon tissues. Scale bar: 200 μm. A quantitative analysis of
  (B-D) the ileal villous height, crypt depth, and colonic mucosal thickness indicated
  that the inhibition of RAGE alleviated the intestinal mucosal villus shortening,
  crypt shallowing and mucosal thinning caused by 5-Fu. The bars represent the means
  ± SEMs (n = 6 per group). bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01
  vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 vs the 5-Fu+FPS-ZM1 group. (E, F) Representative Western
  blot images showing the protein expression of TLR4, NF-κBp65 and GAPDH (loading
  control). A quantitative analysis indicated that the inhibition of RAGE reduced
  5-Fu-related TLR4 and NF-κBp65 expression in the ileum and colon. The bars represent
  the means ± SEMs (n = 4 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group;
  cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu+FPS-ZM1
  group.'
