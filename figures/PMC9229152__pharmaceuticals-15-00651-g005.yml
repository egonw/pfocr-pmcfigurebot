caption: Kaplan–Maier curve analysis. (A) Kaplan–Maier curve for progression-free
  survival (PFS) according to NLRP3+/CCND1+ versus NLRP3+/CCND1− patients (p = 0.041).
  (B) Kaplan–Maier curve for overall survival (OS) according to NLRP3+/CCND1+ versus
  NLRP3+/CCND1− patients (p = 0.016). (C) Kaplan–Maier curve for PFS according to
  PYCARD+/CCND1+ versus PYCARD+/CCND1− patients (p = 0.05). (D) Kaplan–Maier curve
  for OS according to PYCARD+/CCND1+ versus PYCARD+/CCND1− patients (p = 0.029).
