caption: Protein expression and phosphorylation of members of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  of Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8 cell lines, assessed by western blotting. (A) Expression of
  molecules in PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway in the Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8 cell lines after
  treated with inhibitors. (B,C) The expression levels were evaluated by ImageJ and
  analyzed with 2way ANOVA; bars, Â± SD; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001; ****,
  P<0.0001.
