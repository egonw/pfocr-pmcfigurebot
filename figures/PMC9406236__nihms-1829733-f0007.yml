figure_title: Quantifying immunosuppression of T cells in single-cell data
caption: a, Correlations between immunosuppressive signaling and T cell proliferation
  or cytotoxicity, shown with the violin plot smoothed by a kernel density estimator
  (n = 168 per group). Each dot represents a tumor. The p-value was from the two-sided
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test. b, Association between TGF-β1 signaling and SMAD transcription
  factor (TF) activities, an example from a melanoma tumor. Each dot presents a CD8
  + T cell. The Y-axis presents the TGF-β1 activities. The X-axis presents the SMAD
  TF activities. The p-value was from the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, comparing
  TGF-β1 activities between T cells with positive and negative SMAD activities. c,
  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the quality of signaling activities.
  At different thresholds, the ROC curve presents false-positive rates against true-positive
  rates of predicting SMAD or REL activities through TGF-β1 or TRAIL signaling activities,
  respectively. The diagonal line represents random expectation. d, Quality of signaling
  activities across single-cell cohorts. Each dot presents a single-cell cohort. The
  area under the ROC curve (AUC) measures the quality of TGF-β1 or TRAIL signaling,
  shown with violin plots smoothed by a density kernel estimator. P-values were from
  the two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparing group values with 0.5 (random
  expectation). e, Correlation between PGE2 signaling and cAMP pathway activities,
  an example of a melanoma tumor. Each dot represents a CD8 + T cell. The X-axis shows
  the PGE2 signaling activity. The Y-axis shows the cAMP geneset value. f, Correlations
  between PGE2 signaling and cAMP activities. Each dot represents a tumor. The correlations
  were shown through box plots. The thick line represents the median value. The bottom
  and top of the boxes are the 25th and 75th percentiles (interquartile range). Whiskers
  encompass 1.5 times the interquartile range. The p-value was from the two-sided
  Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparing group medians and zero. g, Gene expression
  of immunosuppressive signals. Each dot represents a patient. Y-axis presents the
  average gene expression across all cells for each lineage (X-axis). All lineages
  were ranked by the median expression and only the top ten profiles were shown in
  box plots as panel f.
