caption: 'Continuous perfusion of ASA and OP in combination with GEM inhibits pancreatic
  tumor xenograft cell PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in RAG2xCγ double mutant mice.
  (A) Expression of PI3K (B) Akt1, and (C) mTOR on pancreatic tumor tissue following
  treatment with ASA/OP/GEM. Tissue images were captured using the Nikon Eclipse EI
  R STG HNDL TRINOC microscope equipped with digital sight 1000 microscope camera
  using the 40× objective. Scale bars represent 200 μm. Quantification of the relative
  density of (D) PI3K, (E) Akt1, and (F) mTOR, as a measure of the number of positive
  cells. Relative density was reported as mean ± SEM of 3–5 slides per treatment.
  The one-way ANOVA Fisher test was used for comparison tests at 95% confidence intervals.
  The indicated asterisks represent the statistical significance compared to the untreated
  CTRL or otherwise shown. Abbreviations: GEM—gemcitabine; CTRL—control; OP—oseltamivir
  phosphate; ASA—aspirin; SEM—standard error of the mean.'
