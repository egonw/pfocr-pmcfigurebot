caption: 'Effects of EPI on podocyte injury in adriamycin‐induced nephropathy rats.
  CON: control. (A) Kidney tissue transmission electron microscopy (×3000 and ×8000).
  The black arrow shows the fusion of the foot process of the renal tissue and the
  thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. (B) The relative mRNA expression
  levels of nephrin and desmin in kidney tissue were measured by RT‐qPCR. (C) The
  protein expression levels of nephrin and desmin were measured by immunohistochemistry.
  The black arrows in the figure indicate that tan is a positive expression, and the
  darker the color, the higher the protein expression. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD,
  n = 3 rats per group, *p < .05, **p < .01 compared with the ADR group. ADR, adriamycin‐induced
  nephropathy; EPI‐H, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim high dose group; EPI‐L, Epimedium
  sagittatum Maxim low dose; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; mRNA, messenger RNA; PA,
  prednisone.'

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
