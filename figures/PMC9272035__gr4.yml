caption: CDots-promoted ECM secretion by activating autophagy via regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway. (a) Volcano diagram and (b) heat map of differentially expressed genes.
  (c) Signaling pathway where FOXA2 is enriched. (d) Western blot results of autophagy-related
  proteins (Beclin1 and LC3B) and autophagy substrate protein (P62) in DPSCs treated
  with CDots (200 ​μg/mL) from 0 to 24 ​h. (e) TEM images. Blue arrow indicates lysome,
  green arrow indicates mitochonsria, yellow arrow indicates autophagosome, and red
  arrow indicates autolysosomes. The two images in the left panel are taken under
  low magnification, and the images in the middle and right panels, which are taken
  under high magnification, are the enlargement of several specific areas of the corresponding
  images in the left panel. (f) Western blot results of Beclin1, P62, LC3B and ECM-related
  proteins (fibronectin, integrin β1, and COL1) in DPSCs treated without or with CDots
  (200 ​μg/mL) and spautin-1, respectively. (g) Western blot results of p-Akt, Akt,
  p-mTOR, and mTOR. DPSCs were treated without or with CDots (200 ​μg/mL) from 0 to
  24 ​h. (h) Western blot results of Beclin1, P62, LC3B in DPSCs treated without or
  with CDots (200 ​μg/mL) and 740Y–P, respectively. (i) The structures of CDots binding
  to p110α/p85α complex, which are extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation
  trajectory at 0, 60, and 120 ​ns, respectively. Secondary structural elements are
  depicted as ribbons. Color is based on secondary structures (α-helix, purple; 3–10
  helix, blue; β-sheets, yellow; turn, cyan; coil, white). (j) The numbers of residues
  in diverse secondary structures of (j1) p110α and (j2) p85α. (k) RMSD of the Cα
  atoms of p110α/p85α in p110α/p85α/CDots complex against time. (l) RMSF values of
  p110α in the p110α/p85α complex and p110α/p85α/CDots complex, respectively. (m)
  3D diagram of interaction between CDots and p110α. Amino acid residues involved
  in the binding of CDots are drawn as sticks, and CDots are shown as ball-and-stick
  model. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms are colored in green, gray, red
  and blue, respectively. (n) 2D diagram of interaction between CDots and p110α. Interactions
  involved in the binding of CDots to amino acid residues are shown as dashed lines
  in different corresponding colors. Data are presented as mean ​± ​SD from three
  independent experiments. ∗ indicates P ​< ​0.05, ∗∗ indicates P ​< ​0.01. “−” and
  “+” symbols represent “without” and “with,” respectively. (For interpretation of
  the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web
  version of this article.)
