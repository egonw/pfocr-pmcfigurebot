caption: 'Heatmaps and principal component analysis (PCA) of the relative abundance
  of DEPs controlling biological processes involved in myocardial repair and remodeling.
  (A) DEPs involved in the regulation of the muscle cell apoptotic process, (B) regulation
  of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and (C) sarcomere organization. Red
  represents upregulated and blue represents downregulated proteins in the LV collected
  from the MI + ABR group compared to MI mice. DEPs were considered to be significant
  at an adjusted p value < 0.05. The calculated p value was obtained using ANOVA hypothesis
  test and adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the false discovery rate
  (FDR). Colored bars indicate the expression levels. X-marking represents proteins
  that were not significantly different between the groups. PCA score plot based on
  the LC-MS/MS data of DEPs involved in the regulation of the muscle cell apoptotic
  process, regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, and sarcomere
  organization GO BP for all experimental groups at 3 days (D) and 7 days (E) post-MI.
  An ellipse highlights the data points coming from one group samples, which were
  run in three technical replicates (dots) and are added for visual purposes only.
  The colors of dots are: green, control (Ct) unoperated mice; dark yellow, Sham operated
  mice; red, MI mice; blue, MI + ABR mice. All protein short names are mentioned by
  the gene nomenclature guidelines.'
