caption: Obtaining hub-DEGs and their GO and KEGG enrichment analysis by analyzing
  scRNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets. (A) Volcano plot showing DEGs between healthy and
  sepsis populations in the scRNA-seq dataset. Red dots represent upregulated genes
  and blue dots represent downregulated genes. (B) Volcano plot showing DEGs between
  healthy and sepsis populations in the RNA-seq dataset. Red dots represent upregulated
  genes and blue dots represent downregulated genes. (C) Venn diagram showing 71 hub-DEGs
  co-expressed in both datasets. (D) Bubble plots showing the results of top five
  GO functional enrichment of 71 hub-DEGs. BP is shown in circles, CC is shown in
  triangles, and MF is shown in squares, with the horizontal coordinates representing
  ratio. (E) Bubble plots showing the results of the KEGG signaling pathway of 71
  hub-DEGs, and the horizontal coordinate represents ratio.
