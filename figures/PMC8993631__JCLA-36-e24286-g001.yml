caption: AHNAK and circ_0008194 was expressed at high levels in HCC tissues and cell
  lines. (A) QRT‐PCR was used to detect relative expression of AHNAK in HCC tissues
  and matched para‐cancer tissues (n = 40). (B) Protein expression level of AHNAK
  protein in HCC tissues. (C) QRT‐PCR was used to detect relative expression of circ_0008194
  in HCC tissues and matched para‐cancer tissues. (D) Correlation analysis of AHNAK
  and circ_0008194. (E) RT‐PCR confirmed the expression of circ_0008194 in cell lines.
  (F) Hep3B cells treated with circ_0008194 shRNA. (G) Hep3B cells treated with circ_0008194
  overexpressed lentivirus. (H) Cells treated with RNase and detected by PCR (n.s
  indicated no significance, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001)
article_title: CircRNA_0008194 functions as a ceRNA to promote invasion of hepatocellular
  carcinoma via inhibiting miR‐190a/AHNAK signaling pathway.
