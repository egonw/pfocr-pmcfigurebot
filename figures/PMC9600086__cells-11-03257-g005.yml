caption: (a) Regulation of the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway by PDEs during aging
  of IMR-hPSC-CMs from day 30 to day 90. Model traces of cGMP production after stimulation
  via S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and subsequent (b) PDE1 inhibition via vinpocetine
  (VIMPO), (c) PDE2 inhibition via EHNA, (d) PDE3 inhibition via Cilostamine (CILO),
  (e) PDE5 inhibition via Sildenafil, and (f) PDE9 inhibition via PF-04447943 (PF-),
  and saturation via 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). (g,h) Bar chart (g) and model
  trace (h) illustrating the effect of simultaneous PDE1, PDE2, and PDE5 inhibition
  after NO-cGMP pathway stimulation via GSNO. All data is composed of three independent
  experimental batches. * p < 0.1; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001.
