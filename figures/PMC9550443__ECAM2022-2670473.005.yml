caption: 'Effect of CHSSC on the interaction between FKBP12.6 and RyR2 in ischemic
  H9C2 cells. (a) Co-immunoprecipitation was used to evaluate the interaction between
  FKBP12.6 and RyR2. (b) Quantitative analysis of the level of RyR2/FKBP12.6 in each
  group. N = 3 samples per group. All data are expressed as means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control + H-89 group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.05, ###P
