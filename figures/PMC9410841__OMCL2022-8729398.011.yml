caption: The mechanism map of the protective properties of COG1410 against cerebral
  I/R injury. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were triggered by cerebral
  I/R, which resulted in brain injury, neurological deficits, and even mortality.
  COG1410 treatment could improve the changes mentioned above. Mechanistically, COG1410
  of LRP1 agonist shifted microglia towards the M2 phenotype by inhibiting the TXNIP/NLRP3
  signaling pathway. The activation was labeled with “+,” and the inhibition was labeled
  with “-.”
