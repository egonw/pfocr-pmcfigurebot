caption: circ_0006174 upregulates Wnt signal pathway-related proteins in CRC cells
  and promotes lung metastasis in vivo. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis suggested
  that CCBE1 was positively related to Wnt signal pathway in CRC. (B) Western blotting
  was used to detect Wnt signal pathway-related proteins (c-Myc and cyclin D1) in
  CRC cells transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor. (C) RT-qPCR
  was used to detect circ_0006174 expression in sh-circ_0006174 group. (D) The number
  of lung metastases were calculated in nude mice. The metastatic nodules were indicated
  by the arrows. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. sh-NC. circ, circular RNA; CRC, colorectal
  cancer; CCBE1, calcium-binding epidermal growth factor domain-containing protein
  1; circ, circular RNAs.
