figure_title: Treg suppression of conventional T cells
caption: 'eTreg directly suppress Tconv cells through secretion of soluble mediators
  including immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β, through TIGIT-induced
  secretion of Fgl2, via enzymatic catabolism of soluble ATP and PGE2, and through
  scavenging of IL-2 in the milieu. Furthermore, eTregs induce a tolerogenic profile
  in APCs, triggering indirect suppression of Tconv activation, proliferation, and
  transcription of their pro-inflammatory factors. Indeed, eTregs induce expression
  of IDO in APCs, which activates the kynurenine pathway via CTLA-4 binding and results
  in tryptophan deprivation, reduced antigen presentation upon LAG-3 ligation, and
  decreased Tconv co-stimulatory signaling via CTLA-4. eTregs can also trigger death
  of the targeted cell upon binding to the death receptors FAS and TRAIL and by secretion
  of perforin and granzyme. Reinforcement of the eTreg phenotype occurs via PD-1/PD-L1
  engagement, semaphorin 4 binding to Nrp1, and IL-2-mediated signaling.A2A: adenosine
