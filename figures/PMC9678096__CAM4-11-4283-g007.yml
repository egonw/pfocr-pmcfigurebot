caption: Capsaicin suppressed diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‐induced rat liver tumorigenesis.
  (A) Schematic diagram of the liver tumor model establishment and capsaicin administration.
  (B) Subcutaneous transposition of the spleen in rats. (C) The morphology of the
  liver in different rat groups. Scale bars, 1 cm. (D) The liver of the DEN‐induced
  rat treated with capsaicin presented a reduced number of surface tumor nodules.
  (n = 4). (E) Hematoxylin and eosin staining in the liver of the DEN‐induced rat
  model treated with capsaicin showed reduced necrosis, cellular edema, and nuclear
  atypia. Scale bars, 20 μm (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01)
