caption: MKP-2 Silencing Induced Breast Cancer Cell Sensitivity to Dox. (A) MCF-12A
  and MDA-MB-231 cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then assessed
  for MKP-2. In addition, a confocal image of immunofluorescence staining for MKP-2
  in MCF-12A cells was taken. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with MKP-2 siRNA (10
  nm) for 72 h then (B) the efficiency was assessed by measuring fluorescence using
  an MKP-2 siRNA fluorescent negative control and (C) by detecting MKP-2 mRNA and
  protein levels using qRT-PCR and Western blot. (D) MCF-12A cells were infected with
  Adv. MKP-2 (500 pfu/cell) for 24 h, then cell lysates were prepared and assessed
  for MKP-2 and β-Actin. After transfection or infection with MKP-2, MDA-MB-231, and
  MCF-12A, cells were treated with Dox (0.6 or 1 µM) for 24 h, and then cell lysates
  were prepared and assessed for (E) p-JNK and JNK, and (F,G) cell viability. (F)
  morphological changes were detected using phase contrast microscopy (×20). Each
  value represents the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05,
  ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001 compared with the correspondent control.
