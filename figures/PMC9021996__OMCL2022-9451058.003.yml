caption: MicroRNA sequencing revealed that miR-1a-3p was a participant after EPA treatment.
  (a) Heatmap showing the differentially expressed microRNAs. (b) Volcano map showing
  upregulated and downregulated microRNAs. (c) KEGG analyses of the 10 most changed
  microRNAs. (d) qRT–PCR of the top changed miRNAs normalized to U6. The data are
  presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p < 0.001.
