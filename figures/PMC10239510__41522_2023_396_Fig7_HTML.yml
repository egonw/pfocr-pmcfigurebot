figure_title: The paradigm summarizing the thermogenic and anti-inflammatory properties
  of YJT via the gut microbiota and related multiple signaling pathways
caption: Propylthiouracil (PTU)-treated hypothyroid rats exhibit hypothermia, hypophagia,
  and hyperinflammation, which have been associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis,
  particularly with extremely enriched Prevotellaceae. As a prebiotic, Yijung-tang
  (YJT) modulates the gut microbiota and metabolite-related receptors (e.g., FFAR3
  and TGR5/FXR) to stimulate gene expression of intestinal tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)
  for norepinephrine synthesis and iodothyronine deiodinases 2 (Dio2) for thyroid
  hormone metabolism, and consequently activates the thermogenic pathway in brown
  adipose tissue (BAT) and attenuates hypothyroidism-related systemic inflammation.
  In contrast, L-thyroxine (T4) treatment in hypothyroid rats stimulates ghrelin secretion
  and activates intestinal LPS–TLR4 and peptidoglycan–Pglyrp2 signaling pathways,
  and leads to hyperthermia, hyperphagia, and hyperinflammation.
