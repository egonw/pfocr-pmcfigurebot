caption: Overview of transcriptome profiles between 22Rv1 cells and hypoxia-resistant
  cells. (A) Schematic outline of RNA sequencing in 22Rv1 cells or hypoxia-resistant
  cells. (B,C) Volcano plot in 22rv1-CI and 22rv1-PCI displaying fold change versus
  adjusted p-values. Red dots represent the significant DEGs (|FC| > 1.5, p-value
  < 0.05). (D) GSEA enrichment score curve of hypoxia- or migration-related genes
  in 22rv1-CI. (E) Top significantly affected canonical pathway analysis in 22rv1-CI.
  (F) Gene network analysis associated with hypoxia and wound healing signaling in
  22rv1-CI. Red, upregulated; green, downregulated. (G) Representative gene networks
  of Col13A1 in 22rv1-CI. (H) Top significantly affected canonical pathway analysis
  in 22rv1-PCI. (I) PTEN canonical pathway in 22rv1-PCI. (J) Wnt pathway in 22rv1-PCI.
