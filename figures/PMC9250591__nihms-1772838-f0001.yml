figure_title: HH pathway component expression in the adult tongue
caption: '(A-A’’) Simplified model of HH feedback inhibition. (A) Inactive HH signaling:
  PTCH1 suppresses SMO in the absence of HH ligand leading to production of GLI repressor
  (GLIR) and the suppression of HH-dependent gene expression. (A’) Active HH signaling:
  HH ligand binds to PTCH1, relieving SMO inhibition, and leading to GLI activator
  (GLIA) production and the initiation of HH target gene expression (including Gli1,
  Ptch1, and Hhip). (A’’) HH feedback inhibition: HHIP protein sequesters HH ligand,
  allowing unbound PTCH1 to re-establish SMO repression, and the subsequent repression
  of HH pathway activity. (B-E) X-Gal staining of whole tongues from Gli1lacZ/+, Gli2lacZ/+,
  Ptch1lacZ/+ and HhiplacZ/+ mice. (B) Gli1lacZ is expressed in all three taste papillae:
  fungiform (FP, circles) on the anterior tongue, foliate (FOL, bracket) and circumvallate
  (CV, box, B’) on the posterior tongue. The remaining tongue is covered by Gli1lacZ
  negative non-taste filiform papillae (FILIF) on the anterior tongue and on the taste
  papilla-free intermolar eminence (B’’). The scale bars apply to all whole tongue
  images. (C-C’’) Gli2lacZ is present in both taste (FP, CV and FOL) and non-taste
  FILIF papillae. (D-D’’) Ptch1lacZ expression is apparent in FP, CV and FOL and in
  FILIF in intermolar eminence. (E-E’’) HhiplacZ is expressed in non-taste FILIF in
  the anterior tongue and intermolar. Insets illustrate expression in FILIF surrounding
  FP (E) and in the intermolar eminence (E’’). Dotted lines demarcate intermolar eminence
  from anterior tongue.'
