caption: Expression of miR-342-3p, FPR1 and KEGG pathways in HUVEC. (A) The mRNA levels
  of miR-342-3p after HUVEC with H/R transfection with miR-342-3p mimics and miR-342-3p
  inhibitor. (B) The mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels of FPR1 after HUVEC with
  H/R transfection with miR-342-3p mimics and miR-342-3p inhibitor. ***P < 0.001.
  Original blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. A. (C) The protein levels of
  proteins of autophagy, mTOR signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway,
  and vasculogenesis. Original blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. B.
