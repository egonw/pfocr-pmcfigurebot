caption: 'Analysis of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the control and drug-treated
  male Npr1 gene-ablated mouse heart: Representative heart tissue sections for interstitial
  fibrosis from control and drug-treated male mice were stained with picrosirius red
  staining (panels (A,B)). The red color is indicative of fibrosis. Similarly, the
  representative heart tissue sections for perivascular fibrosis are presented from
  control and drug-treated mice (panels (C,D)). Values are expressed as means ± S.E.
  (n = 6 animals in each group). Statistical significance is expressed as ### p <
  0.001, vehicle-treated 0-copy and 1-copy vs. 2-copy; *** p < 0.001, vehicle-treated
  0-copy,1-copy and 2 copy vs. drug-treated same gene copy number. NS: not significant.'
