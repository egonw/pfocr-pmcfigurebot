caption: Effect of exposure to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush on
  the expression of FAK and phosphorylated FAK in gingival fibroblasts. HGnFs were
  exposed to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush for 15, 30, and 60
  min. Each bar indicates mean Â± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.
