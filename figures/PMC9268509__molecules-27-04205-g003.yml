caption: Effect of AHE and agerarin on inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway
  stimulated by IL-4. (A) Chemical structure of agerarin. (B,C) HaCaT cells were pretreated
  with 20 and 40 μg/mL AHE (B) or 20 and 40 μM agerarin (C) for 30 min before stimulation
  with (+) or without (−) 20 ng/mL IL-4. After 15 min, cells were harvested, and the
  phosphorylation of JAK1 at Y1034/1035, JAK2 at Y1007/1008, and STAT3 at Y705 were
  measured by immunoblotting. Band intensities of phosphorylated proteins were measured
  using ImageJ and normalized to the corresponding total proteins. GAPDH was used
  as an internal control. ns, not significant; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  compared to control (n = 3) by an unpaired two-tailed t-test. AHE, ethanolic extract
  of Ageratum houstonianum.
