caption: The fibrinolytic process. This pathway is modulated by proteases and clotting
  factors that stimulate the transformation of plasminogen into plasmin, which is
  in turn responsible for the subsequent degradation of fibrin. t-PA, tissue plasminogen
  activator; u-PA, urokinase; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; A2AP, α2-antiplasmin;
  FXIa, activated factor XI; FXIIa, activated factor XII; KK, kallikrein; (+), activation;
  (–), inhibition.
