caption: 'Ferroptosis occurred in HIBI and peaked at 24‐h post‐event. (A) Western
  blot results indicated a rapid decline in GPx4 levels in rat hippocampi at 24‐h
  post‐HIBI (n = 5 for each time point). (B) Quantification of GPx4 level. (C) Lipid
  peroxidation assay results revealed an increase in MDA concentration at 24‐h post‐HIBI
  and a decrease following Fer‐1 administration relative to the Sham and HIBI groups,
  respectively (n = 5 per group). (D) Representative TEM images of hippocampal neuron
  mitochondria at 24‐h post‐HIBI. The atrophied mitochondria are indicated by red
  arrows (n = 3 per group). (E) ICP‐MS results revealed increases in iron content
  at 24‐h post‐HIBI and declines in iron content following Fer‐1 or Res administration
  (n = 5 per group). (F) Western blot results indicated alleviation of GPx4 downregulation
  in the HIBI group following Fer‐1 administration (n = 5 per group). (G) Quantification
  of GPx4 levels. Values are presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  vs. the Sham group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 vs. the HIBI group.
