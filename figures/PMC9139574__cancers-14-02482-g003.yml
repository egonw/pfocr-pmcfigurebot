caption: 'Functional and metabolic parameters of the control experiment in high fat
  and normal diet rats under inhibition of the PPARγ pathway with BADGE: (A) Representative
  images for day 30 of multiparametric MRI and PET/CT for both diet regimes under
  BADGE treatment (B) Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the diffusion-weighted
  imaging. (C) Standardized uptake value (SUV) of the positron emission tomography
  (PET). (D) Calculated parameters for the quantitative model of the signal curve
  of the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion for BADGE experiment. White
  arrows indicate location of the bone metastases. Abbreviation a.u. stands for arbitrary
  units. Statistical analyses were performed with two-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
  U test. Significant values are defined as p < 0.05. Values of p are indicated up
  to a value of 0.15.'
