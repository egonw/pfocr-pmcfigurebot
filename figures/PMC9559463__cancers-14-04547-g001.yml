caption: Schematic representation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. (A) Binding
  of the extracellular HH ligand to the Patched 1 (PTCH1) receptor releases Smoothened
  (SMO) from inhibition. SMO starts an intracellular signaling cascade including Suppressor
  of Fused (SUFU), which results in activation of the transcription factors of the
  GLI family; (B) loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 or activating mutations in SMO
  activate the HH signaling pathway in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cells. This process
  can be inhibited by HH pathway inhibitors (HHI); (C) intrinsic resistance as caused
  by SMO G497W mutation, or acquired resistance as caused by SMO D473Y mutation impede
  entry of the drug into the binding site. Modified according to [].
