caption: Clustering analysis of VMRGs in LSCC. A–B LSCC samples (TCGA and GSE27020)
  were divided into 2 clusters using the consensus clustering method. C PCA analysis
  of cluster 1 and cluster 2. D t-SNE analysis of clusters 1 and 2. E Differential
  expression of prognostic genes in clusters 1 and 2. F–G The KM plot of the two clusters
  of patients with LSCC for determination of OS and PFS. H Differences in immune cell
  infiltration between the two clusters using ssGSEA. I–J The distribution of risk
  scores in the two clusters. K–L GVSA and GSEA enrichment analysis of differential
  genes between the two clusters
article_title: RUNX1-BMP2 promotes vasculogenic mimicry in laryngeal squamous cell
  carcinoma via activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
