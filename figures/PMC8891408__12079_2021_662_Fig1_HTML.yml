caption: 'CaSR mutants identified in breast cancer patients differ in their ability
  to stimulate Rac but not ERK. CaSR mutations detected in general (A) and in breast
  cancer patients (B), according to the COSMIC database. (C) Structure of CaSR dimers.
  Human Calcium-Sensing Receptor in the active state (Ling et al. ), corresponds to
  the 7DTV structure in the Protein Data Bank, the carboxyl terminal region was introduced
  in the model. The position of single amino acid changes in the CaSR mutants studied
  in this work is shown in the right CaSR monomer. (D) Expression of wild type and
  mutant CaSR. Electrophoretic mobility of wild type and mutant CaSR expressed in
  HEK-293. Immunoblots were revealed with the anti-CaSR ADD (1:15,000) monoclonal
  antibody. Cells transfected with empty vector served as control. (E) Hypothetical
  model showing CaSR signaling to Rac-GTPase via mTORC2. (F-I) CaSR mutants identified
  in breast cancer patients activate Rac-1 GTPase and the ERK pathway. Rac-1-GTP was
  isolated by pull-down with GST-PAK-CRIB-domain beads using lysates from HEK-293
  cells transiently transfected with wild type CaSR or the indicated mutant. Cells
  were stimulated with R568 + extracellular calcium for 3 min, and isolated Rac-1-GTP
  was revealed by western blot. Graphs represent three independent experiments. Comparative
  analyses of Rac-1 activation by wild type and mutant CaSR (F-I, left panels). (F)
  Wild type CaSR vs N639K; * p = 0.0100, # p < 0.05; (unpaired Student t test; n = 3).
  (G) Wild type CaSR vs T732A; *p = 0.0226, # p = 0.0237; (unpaired Student t test;
  n = 3). (H) Wild type CaSR vs R886Q; **p = 0.0067, # p = 0.0256; (unpaired Student
  t test; n = 3). (I) Wild type CaSR vs. V894I; * p = 0.0232, *p = 0.0339; (n = 3).
  Comparative effect of wild type and CaSR mutants on ERK phosphorylation (F-I, right
  panels). HEK-293 cells expressing wild type CaSR or the indicated CaSR mutants were
  stimulated or not with 1 µM R-568 + 1.5 mM CaCl2 for 3 min. Graph represents the
  densitometric analysis of ERK phosphorylation. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). (F) Wild type CaSR vs N639K; ****p < 0.0001; (G) Wild type CaSR vs T732A;
  ** p = 0.0031, **p = 0.0064; (H) Wild type CaSR vs R886Q; *** p = 0.0005, **p = 0.0060;
  (I) Wild type CaSR vs. V894I; *** p = 0.0002, #p = 0.0151; (unpaired Student t test;
