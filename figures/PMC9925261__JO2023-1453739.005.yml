caption: GCH1 was associated with homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. GSEA
  analysis of differentially expressed genes between high- and low-GCH1 expression
  groups showing the enrichment of homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway in
  (a) breast cancer and (b) ovarian cancer. (c-d) Shown are expression profiles of
  28 HRR-related genes in high- and low-GCH1 groups, and data are presented by heatmaps.
  Correlation diagrams showing the association between GCH1 expression and HRR-related
  genes, including FANCA and BRCA2 in (e) breast cancer and RAD54L and FANCI in (f)
  ovarian cancer. Representative immunofluorescence images and quantification of γ-H2AX
  foci and Rad51 foci formation in control and 5 mM DAHP-treated groups of (g, i)
  MDA-MB-231 cells and (h, j) A2780 cells. 10 μM niraparib was used as positive control
  and all the drugs were administered for 24 hours.
