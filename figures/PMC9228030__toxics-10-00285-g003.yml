caption: 'Interference with p38 MAPK signaling is associated with Rg1 inhibition of
  LPS-induced tight junction disruption in IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. IPEC-J2 cells were
  treated with vehicle and LPS at the indicated concentrations for 48 h. (A) Western
  blot analyses of p38 MAPK signaling molecules. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with vehicle,
  LPS (2 μg/mL) and Rg1 at the indicated concentrations for 48 h; (B) Western blot
  analyses of p38 MAPK signaling molecules. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with vehicle,
  LPS (2 μg/mL), SB203580 (10 μM), and Rg1 (60 μM) for 48 h; (C) Western blot analyses
  of tight-junction-related proteins. β-Actin was used as an invariant control for
  equal loading. Blots are representative of three independent experiments with densitometry
  showing the mean ± s.d. * p < 0.05 versus control and ** p < 0.01 versus control.
  # p < 0.05 versus LPS and ## p < 0.01 versus LPS.'
