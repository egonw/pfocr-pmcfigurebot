caption: RBM8A depletion retards tumor growth of breast cancer (BC) in the mouse model.
  (a–c) The  effects of RBM8A knockdown on BC tumor volume and tumor weight were assessed.
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Lv-sh-NC; (d) the protein expression of RBM8A was detected by western
  blot in xenograft tissues of BC. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. Lv-sh-NC.
