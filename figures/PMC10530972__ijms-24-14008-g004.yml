caption: KLF4 affected the expression of HIF-1α. HFL-1 cells were treated with bleomycin
  to induce fibrosis. Cytoplasmic proteins (a) and nuclear proteins (b) were extracted
  at multiple time points (0, 3, 6, and 9 h). Western blotting assays were conducted
  to examine KLF4 and HIF-1α expression, with GAPDH as an internal reference. Mice
  were injected with bleomycin to induce pulmonary fibrosis. Tissue RNA was extracted
  from KLF4-overexpressing mice and wild-type mice treated with normal saline as a
  control for qRT-PCR test to detect the mRNA expression of HIF-1α (c,d). The values
  are expressed as mean ± SD from six samples in each group. ns implies no significance,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, as determined by t-test. The sites of the putative
  KLF4 binding motif in −2000 HIF-1α promoter were predicted using the JASPAR database
  (e).
