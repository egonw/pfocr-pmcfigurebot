caption: Binding of EMT-AFTs, such as Snail, TWIST, and ZEB1, to E-boxes in the promoter
  suppresses E-cadherin gene expression, which is the hallmark of EMT. The cells then
  acquire mesenchymal features and migration capability, and even the stem-cell-like
  features of the so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Moreover, several complex signaling
  pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, TGF-Î² pathway, Notch pathway, etc., participate
  in regulating the expression of EMT-AFTs, forming a feedforward loop that promotes
  the EMT process [,].
