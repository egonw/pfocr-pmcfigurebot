caption: The p38 MAPK mediated the miR-26a-3p deficiency-induced behavior disorders.
  A Experimental paradigm of rats injected AAV-miR-26a-3p sponge virus followed by
  administration of SB203580, a specific antagonist of p38 MAPK. B Behavioral responses
  of OFT in miR-26a-3p knock-down and SB203580-treated rats. C Behavioral responses
  of EPM in miR-26a-3p knock-down and SB203580-treated rats. D Behavioral responses
  of FST in each group. E Behavioral responses of tail suspension test (TST) in each
  group. F Behavioral responses of novel object recognition test (NORT) in each group
