caption: 'SC-1 specifically inhibited TGFβ-stimulated p38 signaling in A549 cells.
  (A) A549 cells were pretreated with 20 μM SC-1 for 4 h, followed by TGF-β stimulation
  for different time intervals (15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min). The quantified results,
  represented as arbitrary units of signal intensity, are shown in the lower graphs.
  (B) Cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of SC-1 (0–40 μM) for
  4 h, followed by stimulation with TGF-β (100 pM) for 90 min. Protein extraction
  was performed, and Western blotting was carried out. The protein levels were quantified
  and presented as a percentage relative to the TGF-β-stimulated control. ** p < 0.001
  vs. TGF-β-stimulated control. (C) Cells were preincubated with vehicle (DMSO), SC-1
  (20 μM), SB431542 (10 μM), SB203580 (10 μM), Stattic (20 μM), and SL327 (20 μM)
  for 4 h, followed by stimulation with TGF-β (200 pM) for 48 h. The protein levels
  of IL-6, PAI-1, and fibronectin were quantified in (D). The protein level for each
  gene was normalized to β-actin and expressed as percentage to TGF-β-treated control.
  Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical
  significance relative to TGF-β group is indicated: ** p < 0.001.'
