caption: 'A) Time evolution of the FC events fraction of E. coli (blue) and S. cerevisiae
  (red) during continuous co-culture at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1. Experimental data
  are represented by markers and simulation data by dashed lines. B) and C) Time evolution
  of the relative enzyme (Î¨rel) corresponding to each metabolic pathway for E. coli
  and S. cerevisiae, respectively. Metabolic paths are colour coded as follows: GLU
  fermentative/unbalanced consumption in blue, ACE consumption in yellow, ETH consumption
  in purple, and GLU oxidative/balanced consumption in green.'
article_title: Controlling microbial co-culture based on substrate pulsing can lead
  to stability through differential fitness advantages.
