figure_title: Perturbed lipid pathway analysis and targeted pathway maps. (A) Pathway
  analysis of S. aureus infected macrophages was carried out by using MetaboAnalyst.
  The Y-axis, “−log(p)”, represents the transformation of the original p-value calculated
  from the enrichment analysis. The X-axis, “Pathway Impact”, represents the value
  calculated from the pathway topology analysis. (B) The pathway maps were manually
  constructed based on the significantly changed lipids in the sphingolipid metabolism
  and linoleic acid metabolism with reference to the KEGG PATHWAY database. (C) The
  bubble plot showing that 6 representative lipids from sphingolipid and linoleic
  acid metabolic pathways were upregulated remarkably as the infection time prolongs.
  The x-axis and the y-axis in the bubble plot represent the infection time and log
  2-fold change. The size of the bubbles represents the statistical significance of
  the change (FDR adjusted p-value from a multiple t-test with the bigger bubble size
  representing a smaller p-value)
