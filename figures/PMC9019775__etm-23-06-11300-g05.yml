caption: RUT protects against LPS-induced BEAS-2B cell damage by activating the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway. (A) Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in RUT-treated cells induced
  by LPS with or without compound C. (B) MDA levels, and the activities of SOD and
  GSH-Px in RUT-treated cells induced by LPS with or without compound C. (C and D)
  Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Magnification, x200. (E) Protein expression
  levels of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were measured by western
  blotting. Results are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; RUT,
  rutaecarpine; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
