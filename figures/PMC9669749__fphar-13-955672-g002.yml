caption: The inflammatory mechanisms implicated in postpartum depression and potential
  predicted markers. The inflammatory mechanisms implicated in postpartum depression
  include decreased T cell activation, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines,
  activation of kynurenine pathway, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The potential
  predicted inflammatory markers include increased Treg cells prenatally, upregulation
  of IL-6 and Hs-CRP at delivery, high DNA methylation at FOXP3 TSDR prenatally, increased
  IL-8/IL-10 ratio during the third trimester, and high level of quinolinic acid,
  Kyn, 3-OH-kynurenine and 3-OH-anthranilic acid during pregnancy. Trp, tryptophan;
  Kyn, kynurenine; Treg cells, regulatory T cells; IL, interleukin; Hs-CRP, high-sensitivity
  C-reactive protein; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; TSDR, Treg-cell-specific demethylated
  region.
