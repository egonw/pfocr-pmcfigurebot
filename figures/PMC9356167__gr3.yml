caption: 'SDS inhibits OA-induced lipid accumulation and promotes proliferation via
  PI3K/AKT/Gsk3-β pathway in chicken primary hepatocytes. (A) The mRNA expression
  abundances of lipid metabolism related genes. (B) The protein level of PPARα was
  detected by western blot. (C) The mRNA expression of proliferation related genes.
  (D, E) The protein expression of PCNA and CDK2 were detected by western blot. (F,
  G) The total protein and phosphorylation levels of PDK1, AKT, and Gsk3-β were detected
  by western blot. Abbreviations: NC, negative control; OA: oleic acid; PPARα/γ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-alpha/gamma. LY294002: PI3K inhibitor. Replications = 3.
  Bars represent SEM; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
