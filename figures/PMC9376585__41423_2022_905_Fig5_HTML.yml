caption: Virus infection triggers or avoids pyroptosis. CARD8 can recognize active
  HIV protease that cleaves its N-terminus to activate caspase-1 and GSDMD and can
  trigger pyroptosis to eliminate cells infected with HIV. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2
  spike protein interacts with ACE2, causing the formation of syncytia that activate
  caspase-9/3/7 to lead to the cleavage of GSDME. N proteins can function in the ComC
  pathway, which collaborates with MAC to directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The P2RX7 receptor is mediated by ATP when SARS-CoV-2 enters the airway, leading
  to NLRP3 activation. RAAS induces angiotensin II to combine with AT1 to trigger
  the NLRP3 inflammasome in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, H7N9 viruses
  inject ssRNA into the cells to trigger gasdermin E-dependent pyroptosis
