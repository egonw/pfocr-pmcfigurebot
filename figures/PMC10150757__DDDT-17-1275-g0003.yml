caption: AS-605240 inhibits osteoclast formation by suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathways. (A) BMMs were treated with or without AS (5μM) on days 1, 3, and 5, and
  the proteins of c-Fos and NFATc1 were detected by WB. (B) The expression levels
  of the above proteins were quantified to β-actin via ImageJ (n = 3). (C) The expression
  of c-Fos and NFATc1 in BMMs treated with different concentrations of AS was detected
  by WB. (D) The above proteins were quantified by image J to analyze the intensity
  of bands associated with β-actin (n = 3). (E) After BMMs were treated with AS (5μM),
  the expression of Akt signaling pathways was detected by WB at different time points.
  (F) Images of Akt pathway protein P-Akt/Akt and P-PI3K/PI3K expression were quantified
  using ImageJ (n = 3). (G and H) BMMs were pretreated with AS (5μM) and then stimulated
  with RANKL (50ng/mL) at different time points, and specific expression of MAPK and
  NF-κB signaling pathway was detected by WB. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001. All data are expressed as mean ± SD.
