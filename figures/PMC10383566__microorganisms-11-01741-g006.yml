caption: 'The specific enterotype induced by amoxicillin treatment exaggerated liver
  injury in CLP mice. (a) The top 17 enriched KEGG pathways based on DEGs between
  the amoxicillin and water groups. The pathways associated with immune responses
  enriched by GSEA based on the whole transcripts, including (b) Fc gamma r-mediated
  phagocytosis, (c) T cell receptor signaling pathway, (d) leukocyte transendothelial
  migration, and (e) B cell receptor signaling pathway. (f) The cnet plot between
  the KEGG pathways and associated genes. (g) Heatmap of the gene expressions analyzed
  using RT-qPCR, including genes Acaca, Acacb, Cyp7a1, Cyp3a11, FGF2, A2m, Crp, SAA1,
  IL1b, IL6, IL17a, Ccl2, Ccl7, Cxcl13, and Cxcl14. (h) The Pearson correlation analysis
  among gut microbes (Parasutterella, Escherichia/Shigella, and Blautia), several
  marker genes (Cyp7a1, A2m, CD14, Cxcl13, and Cxcl14), and biochemical indexes of
  the liver (ALT, CHO, and MDA). FC: fold change, FDR: false discovery rate, ES: enrichment
  score.'
