caption: The hallmark gene sets of molecular pathways in response to 5-demethyl NOB
  treatment. (a) The top eight hallmark gene sets of molecular pathways associated
  with genes downregulated by 5-demethyl NOB. (b) GSEA demonstrates that the signature
  “Hallmark” gene set is enriched in the DEGs by 5-demethyl NOB treatment. (c) THP-1
  cells were pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or 5-demethyl NOB and then incubated
  with LPS (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. p-p65, p65, TNF-α and actin proteins were detected
  by Western blot analysis. A representative blot is shown.
