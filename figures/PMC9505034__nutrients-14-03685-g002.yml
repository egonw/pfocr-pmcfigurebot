caption: 'Effect of EEIP on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3−L1 preadipocytes. (A)
  Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay under growth media conditions, with
  or without EEIP (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL). (B) Relative microscopic images and quantitative
  data of lipid accumulation. For assessment of lipid accumulation, cells were differentiated
  into adipocytes in DM with or without EEIP (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL) and then oil red
  O staining was performed. (C,D) The protein levels of adipogenic transcription factors
  and the activation of AMPK and the Akt/mTOR pathway in DM−treated cells, with or
  without EEIP (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL) were analyzed by Western blotting. β-actin was
  used as the internal control. Densitometric analysis was performed using Bio-Rad
  Quantity One Software (BioRad; Hercules, CA, USA). Values are represented as the
  mean ± SD. # p < 0.05 vs. the GM group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
  vs. the DM group.'
