caption: Effect of NSC49L and TRAIL treatments on the TP53 and CDKN1A mRNA levels
  and protein kinetics in HT29 and FOLFOX-HT29 cells(A) Cells were treated with NSC49L
  (20 μM) and TRAIL (1 nM) either alone or in combination for 16 h. Total RNA was
  isolated and used for qRT-PCR. Data are the mean ± SE of four estimations.(B) Kinetics
  of p21 protein stability after CHX treatment. Cells were treated with NSC49L (20 μM)
  and TRAIL (1 nM) either alone or in combination for 24 h followed by the treatment
  with CHX (10 μg/mL) for different periods. The p21 protein level was determined
  by Western blot analysis. Blots shown are the representative of two experiments.
