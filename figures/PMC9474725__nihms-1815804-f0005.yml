caption: Ripk2104Asp joints have elevated expression of proinflammatory markers. (A)
  In WT mice, the proinflammatory marker iNos is normally expressed at low levels
  in the joint, and is markedly elevated following DMM surgery. In contrast, knee
  joints of Ripk2104Asp have chronically high levels of iNos expression, independent
  of injury. In A arrows indicate chondrocytes, asterisks mark the meniscus, and arrowheads
  indicate osteophytes in DMM-operated joints. (B) There is no difference in expression
  of the anti-inflammatory marker, CD206, between sham-operated surgery WT and Ripk2104Asp
  joints. Following DMM surgery, CD206 is prominently expressed in WT joints whereas
  it is almost absent in the joints of Ripk2104Asp mice. In B arrows indicate chondrocytes
  and arrowheads indicate synovium. All joints are 8 weeks post-surgery. C) Quantification
  of the number of iNos and CD206 positive chondrocytes in the medial knee joint of
  WT sham, Ripk2Asp104 sham, WT DMM, and Ripk2Asp104 DMM mice. n = 3 independent animals
  for each experimental condition. Error bars represent ±SD and statistically significant
  differences of P ≤ 0.01 (**), P ≤ 0.001 (***), and P ≤ 0.0001 (****) were determined
  by two-way ANOVA with Tukey‟s multiple comparisons test.
