caption: '(A) Representative Western blots and (B) relative density of toll−like receptor
  (TLR) 4 expression in artificial particulate matter (APM) and diesel exhaust particles
  (DEP)−stimulated alveolar macrophages (MH−S). Vehicle control (VC) was treated with
  cell medium including 10% distilled water. Data are presented as the means ± SD
  (n = 3 per group). ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.001 vs. VC; ## p < 0.01 vs. APM group;
  §§§ p < 0.001 vs. DEP group.'
