caption: MapMan analysis based “biotic stress pathways” of DEGs in three groups. (A)
  The schematic diagram of biotic stress categories. The small heatmap in each section
  of the diagram shows the DEGs mapped to that pathway, and a small square indicates
  a transcript. Red, orange, and yellow indicate upregulated genes in each group;
  blue, light sea green, and green means downregulated genes in each group. (B,C)
  DEGs related to ethylene metabolism (B) and signaling pathway (C). Heatmaps of DEGs
  were drawn using the log2 (FC) value obtained from the pairwise comparison of samples.
  Red and blue indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively.
