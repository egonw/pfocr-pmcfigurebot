figure_title: 'p53: Engaging a common pathway by different mechanisms'
caption: Nucleotide synthesis is induced in T cells, cancers, and virally infected
  cells through engagement of the same signaling pathways but by different mechanisms,
  as nicely illustrated in the case of p53. Cancer cells select for loss of wild-type
  p53 activity via mutations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Virus-infected cells
  inhibit p53 through protein-protein interaction. In T lymphocytes, MDM2 facilitates
  p53 degradation. This figure was generated using https://biorender.com/.
