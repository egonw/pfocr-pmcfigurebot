caption: 'PBX3 binds to the G6PD promoter and promotes its transcription. A. Schematic
  diagram of DNA-binding motif of PBX3 as predicted using JASPAR (upper panel) and
  G6PD promoter reporter vectors with or without predicted PBX3 binding site (G6PD-luc
  and G6PDdel-luc, respectively; lower panels). B. Relative luciferase activities
  of G6PD-luc and G6PDdel-luc in PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells. C. Binding capacity
  of PBX3 to the predicted region in G6PD promoter, as examined using ChIP assay with
  an anti-PBX3 antibody followed by PCR. The predicted PBX3 binding site in the promoter
  region of G6PD and the location of the primer set used for PCR are shown. Anti-histone
  H3 antibody was used as a positive control. D-E. Relative luciferase activities
  of G6PD-luc and G6PDmut-luc in PBX3-knocked down HCT116 cells. Schematic diagram
  (D) and relative luciferase activities to control (E) are shown. F-G. Relative luciferase
  activities of G6PD-luc in HCT116 cells overexpressing PBX3 or PBX3DBDdel. Schematic
  diagram of PBX3DBDdel (F) and relative luciferase activities (G) are shown. Cells
  transfected with shCon or pcCon were used as a control. Quantification data are
  shown as mean Â± SD (n = 3). pcCon: pcEF9-Puro; **P < 0.01; NS: not significant.'
