caption: Effects of LMP-1 on regulating the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs
  through the MAPK pathway. Western blot analysis of p-ERK1/2 (A), p-p38 MAPK (C),
  p-JNK (E), and protein levels of the odonto/osteogenic markers (DSPP, DMP-1, OCN,
  and RUNX2) (A, C, E) in DPSCs after being treated with ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor
  U0126 (20 µM), p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor SB203580 (10 µM), JNK pathway inhibitor
  SP600125 (25 µM), respectively. GAPDH served as an internal control. Quantitative
  analysis for the ratios of p-ERK/ERK (B), p-p38/p38 (D) and p-JNK/JNK (F) (**P <
  0.01).
