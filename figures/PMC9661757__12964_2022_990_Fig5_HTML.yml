caption: HIF-1/2α knockdown reverses the JAK1 knockdown–induced growth and migration
  of EC cells. A Western blotting of the indicated proteins in WCLs from KLE cells
  expressing si ctrl, HIF-1α-siR, or HIF-2α-siR. The cells were incubated under hypoxia
  (2% O2). B CCK-8 cell proliferation analysis of KLE cells expressing NC (negative
  control), JAK1-sh1, JAK1-sh1 + HIF-1α-siR, or JAK1-sh1 + HIF-2α-siR. The cells were
  incubated under hypoxia (2% O2). Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3). C Colony
  formation analysis of KLE cells expressing NC (negative control), JAK1-sh1, JAK1-sh1 + HIF-1α-siR,
  or JAK1-sh1 + HIF-2α-siR. The cells were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2). Data are
  shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Scale bar, 100 μm. D Transwell migration analysis
  of IKLE cells expressing NC (negative control), JAK1-sh1, JAK1-sh1 + HIF-1α-siR,
  or JAK1-sh1 + HIF-2α-siR. The cells were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2). Data are
  shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Scale bar, 100 μm
