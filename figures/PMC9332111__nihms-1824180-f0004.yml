figure_title: SDHB deficiency promotes a pro-inflammatory gene signature in T cells
  after activation
caption: '(A-C) Transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq data in activated CD3+ T cells
  (30h). (A) Volcano plot. The log2 FC indicates the mean expression level for each
  gene. Each dot represents one gene. Red dots represent up-regulated genes; black
  dots represent down-regulated genes; the blue dots indicate presentative genes in
  the hallmark gene sets. Highlighted genes (A) were selected based on genes of interest.
  (B) The most up-regulated pathways were identified by ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA). (C) The signature of differentially expressed genes was identified by GSEA.
  (D) mRNA levels of indicated genes were determined by qPCR, n=3, data are representative
  of 3 independent experiments, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA. (E) CD4+ T
  cells were activated for 36 hrs with indicated treatment, mRNA levels of indicated
  genes were measured by qPCR, n=3, data are representative of 3 independent experiments,
  n.s., not significant, ***p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA. (F) Cell culture media from
  the indicated T cell groups (36 hrs after activation) were collected, mixed with
  fresh medium at 1:1 ratio, and then were used for culturing WT T cells for 36 hrs
  under activation condition (left panel), mRNA levels of indicated genes were measured
  by the qPCR (right panel), n=3, data are representative of 2 independent experiments,
  n.s., not significant, *p < 0.05, Student’s t test. Bar graphs, mean ± SEM. NS:
  nucleosides. T cells were activated by the plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies.'
