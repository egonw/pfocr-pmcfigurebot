caption: 'Characterization of unfolded protein in response to SL and the ER stress
  inducer. (A) Effect of SL pretreatment on the level of the GRP78 protein and PERK–CHOP
  pathway determined by Western blot analysis and the relative protein level was calculated
  by densitometry. β-actin was used to confirm the equal loading of samples. (B) The
  effect of the SL pretreatment effect on the downregulation of the IRE1α pathway
  determined by Western blot analysis and the relative protein level was calculated
  by densitometry. β-actin was used to confirm the equal loading of samples. (C) Apoptosis-related
  protein PARP and its cleavage form were determined. Blots were re-probed with β-actin
  to confirm the equal loading of samples; data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).
  * p < 0.05 versus the control group and #p < 0.05 versus the Tg-treated group.'
