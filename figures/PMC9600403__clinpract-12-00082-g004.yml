caption: 'Signaling pathway of type III IFN. The receptor is made of two subunits:
  IFN-28Rα and IL-10R2. Type III IFN binds to the IFN-28Rα receptor which leads to
  a conformational change, resulting in the addition of IL-10R2. JAK1 and TYK2 then
  phosphorylate the intracellular domain of IFN-28Rα, allowing STAT to recognize it
  and bind and form a complex known as ISGF3. This ISGF3 complex moves into the nucleus
  and bind to the promoter region of ISG, known as ISRE, leading to IFN-stimulated
  gene products.'
