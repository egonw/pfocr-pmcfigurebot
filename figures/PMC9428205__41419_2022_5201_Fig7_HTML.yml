figure_title: The potential regulatory mechanism of inhibiting autophagy to enhance
  the cytotoxicity of FIIN-2 on A549 and A549/DDP cells
caption: FIIN-2 can inhibit proliferation and induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
  in A549 and A549/DDP cells by inhibiting FRS2 and its downstream AKT and ERK pathways.
  FIIN-2 can also induce protective autophagy by mTOR inhibition and further activation
  of the class III PI3K pathway (Vps34-Beclin-1 complex). Moreover, cotreatment of
  FIIN-2 with the early stage or late-stage autophagy inhibitors 3-MA or CQ enhanced
  the cytotoxicity of FIIN-2 by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in
  A549 and A549/DDP cells.

  FGFR1-4 inhibitor FIIN-2 on lung adenocarcinoma.
