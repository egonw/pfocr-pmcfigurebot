caption: Importance score of known Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes in PINNet and DNN.
  We compared the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values of known AD-related
  genes, including (A) Alzgene and (B) Digsee, in PINNet and DNN. The y-axes in each
  graph show the importance score. *Denotes a p-value ≤ 0.05 of the Wilcoxon test
  between non-AD related genes and AD-related genes; **indicates a p-value ≤ 0.01
  of significance; ***represents a p-value ≤ 0.001.
