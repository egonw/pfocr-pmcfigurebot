figure_title: ALK phosphorylates TOPK at Y74 ex vivo and enhances the stability of
  TOPK
caption: A TOPK bound with endogenous ALK of H2228 cells by pull-down assay. B H2228
  cells were treated with Alectinib (0 μΜ, 0.01 μΜ, 0.1 μΜ, or 1 μΜ) for 24 h or 0.1 μM
  Alectinib for 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h, and the samples were analyzed by western
  blotting. C The stable shMock and shALK in H2228 cells were established and the
  samples were analyzed by western blotting. D Flag-ALK (v3a/v3b) was cotransfected
  in HEK293T cells with HA-TOPK-WT or HA-TOPK 74F, and the samples were analyzed by
  western blotting. E The expression of ALK and TOPK in various lung cancer cells.
  F The stable ALK (v3a) or (v3b)-overexpression in H1299 and H1975 cells were established
  and the samples were analyzed by western blotting. G The cells were treated with
  CHX (100 μg/ml) for 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h, and the samples were analyzed by western
  blotting. Data are representative of results from triplicate experiments.
