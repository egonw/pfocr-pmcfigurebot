caption: GATA5 overexpression promotes the cell cycle arrest and induces the apoptosis
  of PCa cells. (A,B) The results showed that GATA5 regulated the cell cycle. GATA5
  overexpression elevated the G2 fraction of PCa cells. (C,D) The apoptotic rate in
  the pc-GATA5 groups was higher than in the pc-vector group. (E) The analysis of
  Western blotting clarified that GATA5 overexpression increased the apoptosis markers,
  Bax and Cleaved caspase-3, but decreased Bcl-2. Data are presented as mean Â± SD
  of at least three experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
