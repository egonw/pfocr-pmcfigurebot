caption: Immunoblot analysis of TLR downstream signaling pathway molecules. THP-1
  cells were infected with H. pylori J99 strain at MOI 10 for 16 hours. Cells were
  lysed and processed for immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phospho- or total
  IRF-3, IRF-7, IKKα/β, and β-actin as loading control. (a) Western blot data. (b)
  Bar charts showing average ratio of phosphorylated over total protein after normalizing
  to the β-actin level. Data is representative of two independent experiments. Statistical
  significance was analyzed using Student's t-test (∗∗P ≤ 0.01).
