figure_title: Astrocytes influence plasticity
caption: During development of the mammalian brain’s primary visual cortex, astrocytes
  regulate the so-called critical period during which plasticity allows the neural
  network to form. This depends on a signaling pathway controlled by connexin 30.ROCK2,
  Rho-associated coiled-coil–containing protein kinase 2; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase
