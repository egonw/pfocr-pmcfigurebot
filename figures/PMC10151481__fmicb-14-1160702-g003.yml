caption: Pathway enrichment analysis. (A) Pathways are enriched in differential abundance
  of metabolites between Z173-S and Z173-RKA. Significantly enriched pathways are
  selected to plot (p-value < 0.05), and their impact was indicated. Black, red, and
  green fonts of the labels refer to the number of the total, upregulated, and downregulated
  differential metabolites in each metabolic pathway, respectively. (B) The relative
  abundance of metabolites of each pathway listed in (A). Numbers show the relative
  values of differential metabolites. Yellow color and blue color indicate increased
  and decreased metabolites, respectively.
