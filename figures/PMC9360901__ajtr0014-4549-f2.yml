caption: 'Depletion of UBE2L3 inhibits metastasis of LUAD cells. A. Immunoblotting
  analyses were performed to determine the expression of UBE2L3 in LUAD cells. B.
  Representative images of wound healing assays and the percentage of wound closure.
  Magnification: 40× (scar bar =200 μm). C. The effect of UBE2L3 konckdown on the
  migration and invasion of LUAD cells was assessed using Transwell assays. Magnification:
  100× (scar bar =100 μm). D, E. Representative HE staining of lung metastasis after
  the injection of cancer cells into BALB/c mice via tail vein. Magnification: 100×
  (scar bar =100 μm). Quantification of lung metastasis (n=5 mice per group). ***P<0.001;
  **P<0.001.'

  the GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway.
