caption: 'Expression of SIRT4 alleviates oxidative stress of BMECs induced by heat
  stress. (A,B) Western blotting was used to detect expression and knockdown efficiency
  of SIRT4 in BMECs. (C,D) Expression of SIRT4 alleviated heat stress-induced ROS
  in BMECs. (E–J) The activities of CAT, Mn-SOD, and GSH-Px enzymes and the contents
  of GDH, GSH, and GSSG were detected after expression SIRT4 under heat stress treatment
  in BMECs. NC: negative control; Mock: expression of control vector. These results
  are presented as the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
