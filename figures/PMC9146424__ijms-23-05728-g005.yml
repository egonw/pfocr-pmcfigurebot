caption: FOXO1 inhibitor (Fi) rescued the inhibitory effects of M-PgPs on the immuno-inflammatory
  response of HGECs under normal condition. Relative mRNA expression levels of FOXO1
  (A), BCL6 (B), KLF2 (C), IL-1β (D), TNF (E), IL-10 (F), TGF-β2 (G), IL-6 (H) and
  CXCL5 (I) in HGECs after the treatment of M-PgPs (1:100) for 24 h were analyzed
  using RT-qPCR. HGECs without any treatment served as blank control (BL). HGECs treated
  with P. gingivalis (1:100, 24 h) served as positive control. Fi (1 μM) was added
  2 h before M-PgPs and P. gingivalis treatment. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p <
  0.001. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
