caption: Immune recognition of microorganisms in Drosophila. The two major pathways
  that sense bacteria and fungi in fruit flies are the Toll pathway (left) and the
  immune deficiency (Imd) pathway (right). Both pathways function in the fat body
  for the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) by activating the expression
  of NF-κB-like factors, which are highly conserved among species. In addition, the
  Imd pathway also functions in the epithelial surfaces. The Imd pathway is activated
  when DAP-type peptidoglycan from gram-negative bacteria, and some gram-positive,
  binds to Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs), and this activation leads to
  the generation of AMP and synthesis of Duox enzyme for the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). Gram-positive bacteria contain lys-type peptidoglycan, which
  is recognized by PGRP-SA and Gram Negative Bacteria Protein (GNBP) 1, and GNBP3
  binds to β-glucans of yeasts and fungi, leading to the activation of the Toll pathway.
  This pathway can also be triggered by danger signals like proteases or abnormal
  cell death that activates the protease Persephone (Psh). In all cases, the activation
  of the Toll pathway triggers a proteolytic cascade that activates the protease Spätzle-
  processing enzyme (SPE). This protein will cleave Spätzle (Spz). As a result of
  the activation of the Toll pathway, the transcription factors Dorsal-related immunity
  factor (Dif) or Dorsal (Dl) will translocate to the nucleus, thus inducing the expression
  of AMP genes like drosomycin. Similarly, the activation of the Imd pathway induces
  the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Relish (Rel) and induction
  of the expression of AMP genes, such as diptericin. The generation of ROS is induced
  by the activation of Duox in the presence of uracil. This is caused by the activation
  of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which promotes the release of calcium from
  the endoplasmic reticulum. This signaling pathway, together with the activation
  of the Imd pathway, contributes to the expression of the Duox enzyme during infection.
