caption: Simplified metabolic pathways of sphingolipids. Cer is de novo synthesized
  at the surface of the ER by condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA mediated by
  SPT, forming 3-KdhSph. 3-KdhSph is then reduced to dhSph by 3-KR. DhSph is the substrate
  of CerS, forming dhCer which is converted into Cer by DES1. Cer is transferred to
  the Golgi by CERT or vesicular trafficking and converted into SM by SMS or C1P by
  CerK. Cer is converted into GlcCer by GCSs and further metabolized into complex
  GSLs. Cer is also phosphorylated into C1P by C1PP. GSLs and SM in the Golgi are
  transferred to the plasma membrane by vesicular trafficking, where SM is converted
  into Cer by sSMase or nSMase. C1P is transferred to the plasma membrane by C1PTP.
  In the plasma membrane, Cer can be produced from SM via sSMase and converted into
  Sph by nCDase or C1P via C1PP. Sph can be metabolized into S1P by SphKs. SM in the
  plasma membrane enters into the recycling pathway in the acid compartment of the
  endolysosome, where aSMase and GCase produce Cer, which is hydrolyzed into Sph by
  aCDase. Once released into the cytosol, Sph is reused for Cer synthesis by CerS
  or phosphorylated by SphKs to yield S1P. S1P is hydrolyzed back into Sph via S1PP
  or degraded by S1PL into EA1P and HD. Abbreviations; aCDase; acid ceramidase, aSMase;
