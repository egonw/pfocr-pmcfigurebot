figure_title: SAA1 selectively promotes leukemic cell proliferation by upregulating
  IDO1 expression through activation of the AHR pathway
caption: '(A) Proliferation of human THP-1 and OCI-AML3 (n=22) and mouse WEHI-3B (n=8)
  AML cell lines exposed to SAA1 or SAA3 respectively (1μg/ml, 24-72h). Proliferation
  (B) and IDO1 mRNA levels (C) of human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) isolated
  from MDS or AML (lineage-depleted) BM aspirates (n=8) and exposed to SAA1 (5μg/ml,
  24h), paired t-test (D) Schematic of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model used
  (left). Right: proliferation of total human BM cells isolated from the PDX mice
  injected with either healthy CD34+ (n=3) or patient-derived AML cells (n=8) exposed
  to vehicle (PBS) or SAA1 (1μg/ml, 24h). (E) IDO1 mRNA level from cells in (D); two-way
  ANOVA. In vivo proliferation of leukemic blasts (hCD45+CD33+) (F) and BM AML burden
  (G) in mice treated for 2 or 8 days with either vehicle (n=10 and n=7 respectively)
  or SAA1 (n=14 and n=9 respectively); 2-way ANOVA. (H) Proliferation of total human
  AML BM cells isolated from PDX mice and nucleofected with Cas9 (n=5) or Cas9 and
  the combination of sgRNA#126 and sgRNA#170 (n=8) exposed to vehicle or SAA1 (1μg/ml,
  24h); two-way ANOVA. (I) mRNA level of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 from cells in (D); two-way
  ANOVA. (J) Violin plots for mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in BM-MNCs from healthy
  (n=15) and AML (n=17) patients. (K) CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA levels from cells in
  (B). (L) GSEA analysis of AHR activation signature genes in THP-1 cells co-cultured
  with human osteoblasts for 24h. All data expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis
  was done with unpaired t-test unless otherwise stated. See also .'
