caption: MOBT regulated TAGLN2 and FMN1 via MEF2c. (A) The qRT-PCR and RNA-seq data
  demonstrated that TAGLN2 and FMN1 decreased under MOBT treatment compared with those
  in the TGF-β1 group. (B) The RIP experiment demonstrated that MEF2c bound to TAGLN2
  and FMN1. (C) The Western blot result verified that MOBT inhibited TAGLN2 and FMN1.
