figure_title: Interaction between circ-Pank1/miR-7a-5p/a-syn in MN9D cells
caption: A Schematic diagram of binding sites between circ-Pank1 and the α-syn mRNA
  3’UTR and miR-7a-5p. B The regulatory effect of circ-Pank1 on the expression of
  miR-7a-5p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene detection. The psi-circ-Pank-WT/Mut
  plasmid and miR-7a-5p mimic were cotransfected into HEK293T cells, and the luciferase
  activity was measured after 24 h (n = 3). C qRT–PCR was used to detect the expression
  of miR-7a-5p in the SN of PD model mice treated with rotenone (n = 4). D After si-circ-Pank1
  and the corresponding control were transferred to the MN9D cell model treated with
  rotenone, the expression changes of miR-7a-5p were detected by qRT–PCR (n = 3).
  E The regulatory effect of miR-7a-5p on α-syn expression was verified by the dual-luciferase
  reporter gene detection. The psi-α-syn WT/Mut plasmid and miR-7a-5p mimic were co-transfected
  into HEK293T cells. After 24 h, the luciferase activity was measured. F–H After
  the transfection of miR-7a-5p mimics in MN9D cells (n = 3), Western blot analysis
  of α-syn protein levels F, G qRT–PCR detection of α-syn mRNA expression H. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
