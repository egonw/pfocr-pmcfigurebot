caption: SNORA38B activated the AKT/mTOR and its downstream effectors. (A) Gene set
  enrichment analysis of gene sets including SNORA38B high and SNORA38B low in NSCLC.
  (B) Western blotting analysis of AKT/mTOR and its downstream effectors in A549 cells
  transfected with SNORA38B KO, SNORA38B OE or their counterparts. (C) Rescue experiment
  using SNORA38B KO and SNORA38B OE in A549 cell was conducted to detect the regulation
  of AKT/mTOR and its downstream effectors by SNORA38B. Assays were conducted in triple.
  AKT, protein kinase B; FDR, false discovery rate; KO, knockout; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NES, normalized enrichment score; OE, overexpress; SNORNA,
  small nucleolar RNA.
article_title: Targeting SNORA38B attenuates tumorigenesis and sensitizes immune checkpoint
  blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment
  via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
