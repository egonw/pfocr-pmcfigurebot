caption: Signaling pathway analysis of the EMT-associated lncRNAs subgroup. (A) Heatmap
  demonstrating normalized enrichment scores (NESs) of Hallmark pathways calculated
  by comparing cluster 2 with cluster 1 (with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05).
  Radar plots indicating NESs of Hallmark pathways calculated through a gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) of cluster 1 versus cluster 2 in the TCGA cohort (B) and GEO cohort
  (C).
