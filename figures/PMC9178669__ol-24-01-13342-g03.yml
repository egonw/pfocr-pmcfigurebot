caption: Quantified levels of metabolites produced by the pentose phosphate pathway,
  glycolysis and TCA cycle after treatment with E7386 in CRC organoids. Quantified
  levels of metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. Average metabolite
  concentrations (nmol/g DNA) in organoids treated with E7386 at concentrations of
  0, 30 and 100 nM superimposed onto a metabolic pathway map. Pathways included glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate and the Kreb's cycle pathways. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
  The color of asterisks represents significance compared to the corresponding 0 nM
  controls in case 21 (red), case 28 (green) or case 32 (black). Data are presented
  as the mean Â± SD. N.D., the metabolite concentration was below the detection limit
  of the analysis; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; CRC, colorectal cancer.
