caption: 'Effects of tetrandrine on the proliferation of HBZY-1 cells. (A) The stimulation
  effects of enzymatically deglycosylated human IgA1 on cell proliferation of HBZY-1
  cells were examined. Cells were co-cultured with blank solvent, native IgA, deS
  IgA and deS/deGal IgA for 48, 72, and 96 h respectively. (B) HBZY-1 cells were stimulated
  by deS/deGal IgA and treated with different concentrations of tetrandrine (0, 0.3,
  1, 3, 5 and 10 μM) for 48, 72, and 96 h respectively. IC50 values of tetrandrine
  were calculated by GraphPad PRISM 9.5. (C) HBZY-1 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of tetrandrine (0, 1, 2, 2.5 and 3 μM) in the presence or absence
  of deS/deGal IgA for 48 h. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. The data
  were expressed as means ± S.E.M. Statistical analyses were performed using Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison tests, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001,
  as compared to the group treated by blank solvent, ###p < 0.001 and ####p < 0.0001,
  as compared to the group in the absence of deS/deGal IgA, respectively. (n = 6).'
