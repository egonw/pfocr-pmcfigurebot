caption: Net photosynthetic rate of the transgenic plants and light response curves
  of transgenics produced by asexual propagation for two generations. (A) Net photosynthetic
  rate of the transgenic plants. At 700 μ mol m-2s-1 light intensity, temperature
  30°C, normal atmospheric conditions (CO2 concentration of approximately 400 μ mol)
  was determined. Data are means ± SE of 30 biological replicates. Different letters
  indicate statistically significant differences between genotypes as determined by
  ANOVA using Tukey-Kramer posthoc test (P < 0.05). (B) Light response curves of transgenics
  produced by asexual propagation for two generations. At a temperature of 30°C, normal
  atmospheric conditions (CO2 concentration of approximately 400 μ mol) were used.
article_title: The appropriate expression and coordination of glycolate oxidase and
  catalase are vital to the successful construction of the photorespiratory metabolic
  pathway.
