caption: Hypercholesterolemia disrupts ovarian protein prenylation and results in
  offspring metabolic dysfunction.A, schematic diagram of a dietary regimen of C57BL/6J
  female mice and schematic representation of the experimental procedures used in
  the HF-HCD model (n = 5–9/timepoint). B and C, the fertility of female HF-HCD mice.
  The average litter size was slightly reduced in HF-HCD mice compared to Chow mice
  when these mice (HF-HCD for 16 weeks) were mated with wildtype males (females, n =
  6–11, ∗p < 0.05). C, representative images showing fetuses morphology at P1. The
  female mice were fed with HF-HCD from 6 weeks to 24 weeks. D–F, newborn mice were
  assessed for body length (D, n = 9–12) and body weight (E, n = 9–12) at P1. Blood
  glucose of newborn mice were tested in P2 (F, n = 5–7) before death. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. G, schematic illustration of the MVA pathway and cholesterol
  synthesis. H, mRNA levels of cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes in the ovaries
  of mice fed Chow or a HF-HCD for 10 weeks (n = 8, ∗p < 0.05). I, Western blot analysis
  of Ggps1 in oocytes of mice fed normal chow or a HF-HCD for 16 weeks (∼120 oocytes
  from 5–7 mice in each group). Tubulin served as an internal control. J, Western
  blot analysis of prenylation of Rap 1A in the ovaries of mice fed normal chow or
  a HF-HCD for 10 weeks (n = 5). Tubulin served as an internal control. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, compared with the WT or control by Student’s t test. The
  data represent the mean ± SEM. See also . HF-HCD, high-fat and high-cholesterol
  diet; MVA, mevalonate.
