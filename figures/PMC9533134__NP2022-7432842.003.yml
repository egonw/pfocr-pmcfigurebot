caption: KA-induced alterations in the DG modify in vivo perforant pathway LTP along
  time. (a) Schematic representation of experimental procedures. Conditioning stimulus
  trains began after 20 min of baseline recording and were maintained for 120 min.
  (b) Representative traces of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) obtained
  during baseline (dotted line) and 140 min after stimulation (full line). (c) Plot
  of the EPSP slope for the last 20 min after high-frequency stimulation. Intact and
  30 dsh groups displayed similar slope percentages of EPSP (intact 171.1%; 30 dsh
  172.3%). The EPSP slope percentage in the 10 dsh group was 139.7%, that is, less
  than those in intact and 30 dsh groups. In the 10 dpi group, LTP induction was impaired,
  as opposed to the 30 dpi group where LTP induction was recovered. Notably, LTP from
  mice at 30 dpi took longer time to reach its maximal response compared to all other
  groups. All these findings are more evident in the population spike slope percentage.
  (d) Inner numbers show the mean ± SEM of slope (percent of baseline) from the last
  20 min of recording. Application of conditioning stimulus trains is indicated (arrow).
  Repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc Fisher's test; intact n = 4; 10 dsh
  n = 4; 30 dsh n = 4; 10 dpi n = 4; 30 dpi n = 4.
