caption: The profiles of acetylation regulation genes in liver cancer. (a) The heat
  map of 29 acetylation regulation genes in liver cancer. Red presents upregulated
  gene, and green presents downregulated gene. Lake blue represents adjacent normal
  tissue, and pink represents liver tumor tissue. (b) Vioplot visualizes the differential
  expression of acetylation regulation genes between liver cancer tumor tissue and
  adjacent normal tissue. Blue is adjacent normal tissue, and red is liver tumor tissue.
  (c) Enrichment pathway of 11 DEGs in the GO bubble plot. The larger bubble and red
  color indicated the more significant enrichment process. (d) Enrichment pathways
  in the GO circle plot. The inner circle indicates Z-score, and the red color represents
  the significant enrichment. The outer circle indicates the various pathways, and
  blue dots indicate upregulated genes.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
