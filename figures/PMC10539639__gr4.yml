caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of the significantly different metabolites between
  the nAMD and control groups. A: Bubble diagram depicting KEGG enriched pathways.
  B: Bar chart depicting KEGG enriched pathways; the number on the right side of each
  bar indicates the rich factors (number of different metabolites enriched in the
  pathway/number of all identified metabolites in the metabolites set). C: Pathway-based
  analysis of metabolic changes between groups. The differential abundance score captures
  the average of gross changes for all metabolites in a pathway. A score of 1 or âˆ’1
  indicates that all measured metabolites in the pathway increased or decreased, respectively.
  D: Differential abundance scores in significantly enriched metabolites according
  to their pathway hierarchy.'
