caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of putative targets of QZZD. (A) Bubble
  diagram of the top 10 pathways. (B) KEGG pathway classification. (C) Target-pathway
  network. Green nodes refer to target proteins. Dark blue nodes represent pathways
  of environmental information processing. Light blue node represents pathway of cellular
  processes. Pink nodes represent pathways of organismal systems. Orange nodes represent
  pathways of human diseases.
