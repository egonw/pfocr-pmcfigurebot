caption: The pentose phosphate pathway is a regulator of NOX2 activity and expression
  and of inflammation. (A) Oxidative burst measured by L-012-enhanced chemiluminescence
  in RAW 264.7 macrophages, (B,C) mRNA expression measured using qPCR. Cells were
  co-treated with 6-AN (200 µM) and LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM of n = 8–9 experiments. Data is expressed as (A) a fold change against
  the respective control in relative light units (RLU), measured as an average of
  triplicates over a 60-cycle period, subtracted by blank readings or the fold change
  against the vehicle control of a peak response over an average of triplicates over
  the 60-cycle period, subtracted by blank readings, or (B,C) fold change vs. control
  against the housekeeping gene RPS18. Statistical analysis was conducted via a one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. ** indicates p
  < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001 and **** indicates p < 0.0001.
