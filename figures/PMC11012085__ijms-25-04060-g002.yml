caption: Cyclin E1 and D1 immunohistochemical expression in ovarian cancers. (A) Cyclin
  D1 protein expression in ovarian cancer (panel on the left side of figure shows
  negative cyclin D1 expression, and the panel on the right side shows moderate to
  strong cyclin D1 expression). (B) Kaplan–Meier curve for cyclin D1 nuclear expression
  and progression-free survival (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression).
  (C) Kaplan–Meier curve for cyclin D1 nuclear expression and overall survival (blue
  line = low expression, green line = high expression). (D) Cyclin E1 protein expression
  in ovarian cancer (panel on the left side of figure shows negative cyclin E1 expression,
  and the panel on the right side shows moderate to strong cyclin E1 expression).
  (E) Kaplan–Meier curve for cyclin E1 nuclear expression and progression-free survival
  (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression). (F) Kaplan–Meier curve
  for cyclin E1 nuclear expression and overall survival (blue line = low expression,
  green line = high expression).
