caption: YY1 was upregulated by IL-4/STAT6 pathway and participated in M2 macrophage
  polarization. (A) Morphological changes (from suspended cells to antennal, spindle-shaped
  adherent cells) on the induction of M0 cells to M2 macrophages. (B) Higher proportion
  of CD206 in M2 macrophages (91.0% vs 9.0%) compared with M0 cells (46.9% vs 53.1%)
  was observed by flow cytometry. (C) Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR
  analysis showed the different mRNA expressions of CD163 and YY1 in M2 or M0 cells.
  (D) Western blotting assay of CD163 and YY1 in M2 or M0 cells. (E) Representative
  multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry images of YY1 and CD206 colocalization
  in oe/nc-YY1 M2 macrophages. Scale bar, 20 µm. (F) M2-like morphological change
  was displayed on YY1 overexpression in M0 macrophages. (G) mRNA expression of M1
  (IL-12 and TNF-α) and M2 markers (IL-10 and ARG1) was tested by qRT-PCR in oe/nc-YY1
  M0 macrophages. (H) Higher proportion of CD206 in oe-YY1 M0 cells (82.1% vs 17.9%)
  than in nc-YY1 (47.2% vs 52.8%) was observed by flow cytometry. (I) Luciferase assay
  showed that IL-4 increased the activity of YY1 promoter in M0 macrophages. (J) ChIP-qPCR
  showed significantly increased interaction between YY1 and STAT6 in IL-4 stimulated
  M0 macrophages. (K) High p-STAT6 and YY1 expression in IL-4 stimulated M0 macrophages
  as showed by western blotting. *p<0.05.
