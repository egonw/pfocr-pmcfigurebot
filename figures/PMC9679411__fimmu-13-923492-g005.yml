caption: Effect of DLM on JAK/STAT1 pathway in macrophages. (A) Macrophages were treated
  with DLM or DMSO, respectively, for 0-24 h. (B) Macrophages were infected with DLMr-MTB
  and then incubated for an additional 0-24 h with DLM (0.3 μg/mL). Western blot analysis
  was performed by using antibodies to p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT1 and STAT1, respectively.
  β-actin was used as control. (C) Macrophages were treated with DLM, DMSO, Ruxolitinib
  phosphate (1uM), respectively, for 0-24 h. The cell culture supernates were subjected
  to ELISA analysis to measure CXCL10 protein level. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. *p<.05, ***p<.001, and ****p < .0001 (two-way ANOVA). Results are representatives
  from at least three independent experiments.
