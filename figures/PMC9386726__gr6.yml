caption: Schematic illustration of the TβRI-ICD signaling pathway and its involvement
  in mitotic progression. The non-canonical pathway in which TβRI undergoes proteolytic
  cleavage by TACE/ADAM17 and presenilin 1 in the activated γ-secretase complex, generates
  an intracellular domain (TβRI-ICD). The endosomal protein APPL1/2 and intact microtubules
  are required for the nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD. In the nucleus, TβRI-ICD
  forms a complex with the transcriptional co-activator p300 and promotes expression
  of pro-invasive genes, TGFBR1, MMP2/MMP9, as well as AURKB and BIRC5 (encoding survivin).
  During cell division, TβRI-ICD and APPL1 form a complex with AURKB. TRAF6 promotes
  K63-linked polyubiquitination of AURKB on K85 and K87 during mitosis, which together
  with TβRI-ICD are required for proper cell division.

  cells.
