caption: The catalytic activity of Nse2 and Rqh1 sumoylation function in the same
  pathway to promote Rad3 kinase signaling at the forks. (A) Sensitivities of S. pombe
  with the indicated mutations in rqh1 and nse2 to HU, MMS, UV, and bleomycin were
  determined by spot assay. Dashed line indicates discontinuity. (B) Acute HU sensitivity
  of wild type, rad3Δ, rqh1-SM1, nse2-SA, and the nse2-SA rqh1-SM1 double mutants
  was determined in liquid cultures. (C) Mrc1 phosphorylation in wild-type and indicated
  mutants was examined by Western blot analysis. (D) The experiment in panel C was
  repeated three times, and the quantitation results are shown. ***, P < 0.05.
