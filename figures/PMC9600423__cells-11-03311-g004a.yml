caption: High UBQLN4 mRNA levels are associated with cisplatin and Olaparib responses.
  (A) All cell lines from CCLE dataset were divided according to the median UBQLN4
  mRNA levels and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to compare the
  difference between the two groups. (Right) Bar plot showing the six significantly
  enriched gene sets in high UBQLN4 mRNA group. The x-axis indicated the minus logarithm
  of FDR values of each gene set. (Left) Comparison of the normalized enrichment score
  for the DNA repair pathway determined by GSEA. FDR, false discovery rate; NES, normalized
  enrichment score. (B) Comparison of cisplatin area under curve (AUC) values in low
  UBQLN4 expression cell lines and high UBQLN4 expression cell lines in all cancer
  types in PRISM Repurposing Secondary Screen datasets. Statistical difference was
  evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test. (C) Pearson’s Correlation between UBQLN4
  mRNA levels and cisplatin AUC values in ovarian cancer (OV) cell lines in PRISM
  Repurposing Secondary Screen datasets. The red dots indicated the cell lines containing
  BRCA1 or/and BRCA2 mutations. (D) Comparison of cisplatin AUC values in ovarian
  cancer (OV) cell lines with low and high UBQLN4 mRNA levels in PRISM Repurposing
  Secondary Screen datasets. The red dots indicated the cell lines containing BRCA1
  or/and BRCA2 mutations. Statistical difference was evaluated using the Mann–Whitney
  U test. (E) Comparison of Olaparib AUC values in low and high UBQLN4 mRNA in all
  cancer types in PRISM Repurposing Secondary Screen datasets. Statistical difference
  was evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test. (F) Pearson’s correlation between UBQLN4
  mRNA expression and Olaparib AUC values in OV cell lines in PRISM Repurposing Secondary
  Screen datasets. The red dots indicated the cell lines containing BRCA1 or/and BRCA2
  mutations. (G) Comparison of Olaparib AUC values in low and high UBQLN4 mRNA levels
  cell lines in OV in Sanger GDSC2 datasets. The red dots indicated the cell lines
  containing BRCA1 or/and BRCA2 mutations. Statistical difference was evaluated using
  the Mann–Whitney U test.
