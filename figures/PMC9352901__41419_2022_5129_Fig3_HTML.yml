figure_title: CRMP2 derived from CAFs promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of OCCs
caption: A–E SKOV3 and A2780 cells were cultured with CAF-CM, NOF-CM, CAF-CM + IgG,
  and CAF-CM + CRMP2 neutralizing antibody (Ab) (5 ng/ml). A CCK8 assay detected the
  cell viability of SKOV3 and A2780 cells after neutralizing CRMP2 of CAF-CM. B, C
  Cell invasion ability was validated by Transwell assay after 48 h (100×magnification).
  D, E Cell migration was measured via wound healing assay in the time point of 24 h
  and 48 h after blocking CRMP2 of CAF-CM, respectively (40×magnification). F-J SKOV3
  and A2780 cells were treated with different dose of human recombinant CRMP2(r-CRMP2).
  F CCK8 assay was performed to examine OCCs viability. G, H Transwell assay was used
  to estimate cell invasion ability in different concentration of r-CRMP2 (100×magnification).
  I, J Wound healing assay was used to measure cell migration ability after treating
  with r-CRMP2 at 24 h and 48 h (40×magnification). Tanswell and wound healing quantitative
  analyses were performed using ImageJ software. Results are presented as the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant.
