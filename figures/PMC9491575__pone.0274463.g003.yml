figure_title: Signaling and metabolic pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  genes of each T-PLL subgroup
caption: 'All down- (lilac) and up-regulated (brown) genes of a T-PLL subgroup in
  comparison to the normal control references were considered at the q-value cutoff
  of 5%. Enriched pathways are marked by asterisks (Fisher’s exact test: ‘**’: q ≤
  0.01, ‘*’: q ≤ 0.05). A–C: Cancer signaling pathway analysis for subgroups SG1,
  SG2, and SG3. D–F: Metabolic pathway analysis for SG1, SG2, and SG3.'
