caption: 'Evaluation of cellular mitochondrial function by oxygen consumption assay.
  (A): Basal oxygen consumption rate. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in non-mitochondrial
  respiration was measured by MitoXpress® Xtra assay in white adipocytes treated with
  browning agents. Cells were incubated in complete medium (basal condition). The
  histogram shows optical density (O.D Ex380/Es650 nm) (±SD, n = 3 biological replicates;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (B): OCR for mitochondrial ATP production. (* p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01). (C): OCR for maximal respiratory capacity. (D): OCR for uncoupled
  respiration. OCR was measured according to protocol described in the methods section.
  Cells were incubated in complete medium (basal condition), or medium containing
  only palmitate (fatty acid), or medium containing only glucose (glucose). The histogram
  shows optical density (O.D Ex380/Es650 nm) (±SD, n = 3 biological replicates; *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (E): A scheme to explain supposed futile lipogenic pathway
  with fatty acid and triglyceride formation, succeeded by triglyceride lysis and
  oxidation of free fatty acids. In particular, three enzymes, DGAT2, LIPIN1, and
  AGPAT2 generate triglycerides from fatty acids. These are subjected to the lysis
  in cytosolic lipid droplets by ATGL, HSL, and MGL. The released fatty acids can
  both activate UCP1 to produce heat or be transformed into acetyl-CoA by ACSL1 and
  shuttled into the mitochondria across the translocator CPT1and CPT2. Here they are
  submitted to beta-oxidation via ACD, to produce mitochondrial proton leaks (thermogenesis).
