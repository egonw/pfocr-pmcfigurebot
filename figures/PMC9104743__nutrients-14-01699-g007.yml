caption: Effects of MFE on NF-κB pathway related to liver inflammation and the AhR–FAS
  signaling pathway related to the intestinal tryptophan metabolism pathway. (A) The
  intersection of the targets of the GEO database and the targets of the Chinese herbal
  medicine database. (B) Gene ontology (GO) analysis of 53 targets. (C) KEGG pathway
  analysis (D–K) The targets of NF-κB pathway signaling (NKFB1, Il-6, TNF, Il-1b,
  and IKBKB) and The targets of AhR–FAS signaling (AhR, FAS, and SREBP-1c). (For each
  group, n = 10, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
