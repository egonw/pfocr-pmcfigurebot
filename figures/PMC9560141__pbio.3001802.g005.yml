figure_title: Similarities and differences in circadian control of transcript accumulation
  in key genes involved in primary metabolism and signalling
caption: 'Circles represent metabolites involved in the breakdown and biosynthesis
  of starch. Starch synthesis occurs during the day and breakdown occurs at night
  as indicated by the white to grey shading gradient. The dotted line encloses processes
  that take place in the chloroplast or vacuole. HP, Hexose-phosphate; Tre6P, Trehalose-6-phosphate;
