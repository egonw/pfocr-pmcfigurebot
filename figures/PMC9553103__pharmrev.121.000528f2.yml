caption: Compartmentalization of adenosine biochemistry. Along with the canonical
  route of sequential ATP and ADP breakdown through CD39, additional ectoenzymatic
  pathways can contribute to the generation of AMP and its subsequent CD73-mediated
  hydrolysis to adenosine. Those include the direct conversion of ATP into AMP and
  PPi by ENPP1, AK1-mediated transphosphorylation of ADP into ATP and AMP, and alternative
  adenosine-producing pathways from extracellular NAD and cGAMP, mediated via the
  CD38-ENPP1-CD73 and ENPP1-CD73 axes, respectively. The extracellularly generated
  adenosine can further be converted into inosine and hypoxanthine via sequential
  ADA and PNP reactions or be taken up by the cells via nucleoside-selective transporters.
  The intracellular adenosine metabolism depends on the concerted action of cytoplasmic
  forms of purine-inactivating (ADA and PNP) and phosphorylating (ADK-S, AK, and NDPK)
  enzymes. Mitochondria produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Therefore,
  there is a tight link between mitochondrial bioenergetics and adenosine homeostasis.
  In the cell nucleus, adenosine is part of the transmethylation pathway, which adds
  methyl groups from SAM to DNA (DNA-CH3) via DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). SAH can
  also be hydrolyzed to adenosine and L-homocysteine (HCy) by SAHH. Importantly, SAHH
  catalyzes a bidirectional reaction with the thermodynamic equilibrium favoring the
  production of SAH from adenosine and HCy. Through this mechanism, nuclear ADK-L
  drives the flux of methyl groups through the biochemical pathway leading to increased
  DNA and histone methylation. For other abbreviations, see .
