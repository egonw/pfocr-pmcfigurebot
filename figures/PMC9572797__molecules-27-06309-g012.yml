caption: 'Enzyme cascade reactions derived from the D-xylose metabolic pathway studied
  on the 2D or 3D DNA scaffold. (a) Enzyme cascade reactions of xylose reductase/xylitol
  dehydrogenase (XR/XDH) on the DNA scaffold. By changing the enzyme locations of
  XR and XDH, the interenzyme distance was regulated []. (b) Xylose reductase/xylitol
  dehydrogenase/xylulose kinase (XR/XDH/XK) cascade reactions on the DNA scaffold.
  The ADP production used a measure of the cascade reaction efficiency []. (c) Enzyme
  cascade reactions of XDH and XK assembled on a 3D DNA hexagonal prim (HP) with the
  dynamic shape transformation. The dynamic transition from the open state of HP (HPO)
  to the closed state (HPC) was induced by the addition of DNA linkers that hybridized
  with the two domains of HP []. Reprinted with permission from: (a) Ref. []. Copyright
