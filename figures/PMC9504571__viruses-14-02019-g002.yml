caption: Proposed mechanisms of HERV-K expression and stemness in neurons. Exogenous
  HERV-K env mediates stemness by binding to CD98HC, which regulates mTOR-LPCAT1 pathway.
  Additionally, increased HERV-K (HML-2) expression increases NRTK3, after which a
  decrease in neuronal marker MAP2 is observed, promoting an undifferentiated state.
  Finally, in AT/RT cells, loss of transcription factor SMARCB1 allows binding of
  C-MYC to HERV-K LTR, promoting features characteristic of pluripotency and proliferation.
