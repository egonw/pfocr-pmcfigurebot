caption: 'Effects of JDHY on immune function in ALF rats. (a) Flow cytometry was utilized
  to check the proportion of CD4+ T cells in PBMCs of rats, CD4+ T cells in PBMCs
  were significantly reduced in the ALF group (n = 10), and CD4+ T cells were significantly
  upregulated in the ALF+JDHY group (n = 10) and ALF+BAY group (n = 10). (b) Flow
  cytometry was applied to determine the proportion of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs of rats;
  CD8+ T cells notably increased in the ALF group (n = 10) while they were notably
  reduced in the ALF+JDHY group (n = 10) and ALF+BAY group (n = 10). (c) Immunohistochemistry
  was used to measure F4/80 expression in rat liver tissues. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control
  group (n = 6), ##P < 0.01 vs. ALF group (n = 10).'
