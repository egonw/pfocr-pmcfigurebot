figure_title: 'CellChat analysis reveals TENASCIN related epi-CAFs interactions enriched
  in PD. (A) Heatmap showing the cell-cell communication strength between CAFs clusters
  and other cell types. (B) Heatmap of differential epi-CAFs cell interaction between
  PR and PD. The elevated interaction (red block) and down-regulation (blue block)
  interaction in PD is shown. (C) Histogram showing the up-regulated epi- POSTN CAFs
  interaction pathway in PD. The score of informative flow was calculated by summing
  all the interaction probability in PD and PR. The pathway significantly enriched
  in PD is indicated with red letters, while the pathway significantly enriched in
  PR is indicated with blue letters, p<0.01. (D) Violin plot illustrating the expression
  of TCN of CAFs in different treatment time points. (E) Violin plot showing the expression
  of ITGAV of epithelial cells in different treatment time points. CAFs: Cancer-associated
  fibroblasts; PR: partial response; PD: progressive disease'
