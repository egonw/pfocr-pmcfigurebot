figure_title: High level of spermidine accumulation in KSHV-infected cells
caption: '(A) Volcano plot of metabolomic analysis of KSHV-infected 3D TIME cell culture
  commonly detected from two independent analyses. Venn diagram illustrates thenumber
  of differentially detected metabolites with p value <0.05 in KSHV-infected 3D culture
  TIME cells in comparison with mock in two independent metabolomic screenings. Fifty-nine
  metabolites overlap between the two independent screenings. Red dots represent metabolites
  upregulated more than 2.5-fold. y axis denotes log10 p values, and x axis shows
  fold-change values.(B) The polyamine metabolism pathway. ODC, ornithine decarboxylase;
  OAZ, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme; SAMDC, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) decarboxylase;
  dc-SAM, decarboxylated SAM; 5′-MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; SRM, spermidine synthase;
  SMS, spermine synthase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; SAT1, spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase
  1; DHPS, deoxyhypusine synthase; DOHH, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase; DFMO, 2-difluoromethylornithine;
  GC7, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane.(C and D) Intracellular polyamine levels of mock-
  and KSHV-infected TIME cells in 2D and 3D culture. (C) Graph represents fold change
  in comparison with levels in mock-infected cells. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test was performed to assess the significance. ***p = 0.0003; ns, not
  significant (biological replicates: 4; technical replicates: 2–3). Error bars represent
  SEM. (D) Intracellular polyamines in KSHV de novo infected TIME cells harvested
  at 48 h post infection. *p < 0.05 using Student’s t test; ns, not significant (biological
  replicates: 2; technical replicates: 2–3). Error bars represent SEM.(E) qRT-PCR
  analysis of transcript levels of polyamine metabolism-related enzymes was performed
  with total RNAs purified from mock- and KSHV-infected TIME cells in 2D (biological
  replicates: 3; technical replicates: 2–3) and 3D (biological replicates: 4; technical
  replicates: 3–4) culture. *p = 0.0393, **p = 0.0035; ns, not significant using Student’s
  t test. Error bars represent SEM.(F) qRT-PCR analysis of ODC and SAT1 in KSHV de
  novo infected TIME cells for the indicated times (biological replicates: 2; technical
  replicates: 2–3). *p < 0.05, **p = 0.0012, ***p = 0.0005, ****p < 0.0001; ns, not
  significant using Student’s t test. Error bars represent SEM.'
