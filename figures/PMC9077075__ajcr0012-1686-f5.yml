caption: Anti-tumor effects of 5-aza-dC and RAD001 on ES2 and ES2TR160 TS, and TOV21G
  and TOV21G200 (tumorspheres). A. Representative images of ES2 and ES2TR160 TS treated
  without or with 5-aza-dC and/or RAD001. B. The numbers of tumorspheres formed in
  ES2, ES2TR160, TOV21G, and TOV21GTR200 cultures treated without or with 5-aza-dC
  and/or RAD001. C. Distribution of different stages of the cell cycle of tumor cells
  and their tumorspheres treated without or with 5-aza-2-dC (left) or RAD0001 (right)
  by flow cytometric analysis. D. Caspase 3/7 activity in ES2 and ES2TR160-derived
  spheroids treated without or with 10 μM 5-aza-dC and/or IC50 of RAD001 or paclitaxel.
  (**P<0.01, ***P<0.001, all by students’ t-test).
