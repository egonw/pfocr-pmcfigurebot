caption: 'NRF2/ARE-mediated pathway activation by the fraction A1 in stable ARE-driven
  luciferase expression HepG2 cells. Cells were treated for 17 h with increasing doses
  of AE and fractions A1, A2, and A3. Only the A1 fraction showed a dose–response
  effect. On the left side, results are presented in gene expression fold increase
  compared with the control (cell culture medium only, gene expression = 1). Values
  under 1 indicate cytotoxicity effect. The bars are SD for mean relative luminescence
  units of duplicate. On the right side, the same results are presented as a dose–response
  curve (EC50: 742 µg/mL, 95% CI: [582.5, 944.9]). Data points correspond to the fold
  increase for each concentration and bars are SD. EC50 is Efficacy Concentration
  which leads to half-maximal response. R2 is the coefficient of determination obtained
  by non-linear regression model fit.'
