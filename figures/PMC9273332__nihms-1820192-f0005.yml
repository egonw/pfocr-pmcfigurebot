caption: 'Time-dependent progressive divergence of Bcl11b knockout from wild type
  gene expression trajectories at late pro-T cell stages. (A) Schematic of experiments
  to determine pathway of response to loss of Bcl11b. Staggered setup of cultures
  from aliquots of frozen BM progenitors enables samples from the same donors to be
  collected after 10 or 13 days of differentiation, simultaneously. Magenta arrowheads
  indicate that endogenous Bcl11b normally turns on at approximately D7 of differentiation.
  (B) Top: FACS purification strategy for the Bcl11b scRNA-seq experiments. Bottom:
  surface staining phenotypes of progenitor-marker c-Kit levels in WT (green) and
  Bcl11b KOs (replicates in blue, red, orange, also see ). (C) Left: alignment of
  two experiments of Bcl11b KO scRNA-seq profiles after CCA scaling, as ‘Bcl11b_run1’
  and ‘Bcl11b_run2’, in UMAP1–2. N=7451 cells from ‘Bcl11b_run1’, and N=8558 cells
  from ‘Bcl11b_run2’, total 16009 cells. Note that ‘Bcl11b_run1’ samples were only
  collected in D10. Right: Louvain clustering of the integrated samples from all timepoints
  and both genotypes. (D) Samples subsetted according to the hashtag demultiplexed
  genotype and time of harvest, and displayed in UMAP1–2, colored by the same clustering
  annotation as in panel C, right (individual mouse samples shown in ). Note that
  these samples were not subjected to cell cycle regression before UMAP plotting,
  as this helped to distinguish genotypes. Proliferating cells had higher UMAP1 values
  (right). (E) Heatmap displaying the top 5 enriched genes in each sub-cluster ordered
  by approximate developmental trajectories of WT and Bcl11b KO, based on gene expression
  and connectivity in UMAP displays. (Seurat 3 pipeline, minimum fraction of expressing
  cells ≥ 0.25, Wilcoxon rank sum test, avg_logFC ≥ 0.3). Full details of cluster-defining
  marker genes are provided in .'
