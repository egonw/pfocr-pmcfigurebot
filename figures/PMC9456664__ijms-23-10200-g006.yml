caption: Network analysis and biological pathways related to the significantly identified
  proteins in the study population. (A) Network pathway analysis of the significantly
  dysregulated proteins identified in the ON group, compared to those in the OP group
  revealed that they were related to the developmental disorder, hereditary disorder,
  and metabolic disease. The analysis also showed the involvement of the TNF and IFNG
  signaling pathways. (B) The top canonical pathways related to the significantly
  dysregulated proteins identified in the ON group, compared to those in the OP group.
