caption: The MEK inhibitor PD-184352 was found and verified as a potential drug to
  reverse nonresponse to TACE. (a) Compounds predicted by CMap could produce opposite
  responses to those in the high-risk group in GSE14520. The x-axis shows the categories
  of the compounds, and the y-axis shows compound names. (b) Schematic diagram of
  the HIF-1 signaling pathway. (c) IC50 of PD-184352 in Hep G2 was detected in a hypoxic
  environment. (d) Cell proliferation using lobaplatin at cell-specific IC50, PD-184352
  at cell-specific IC50, or both was measured in a simulated TACE environment in vitro.
