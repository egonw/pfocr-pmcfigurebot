figure_title: Starch metabolism in potato photosynthesizing (leaves) and storage (tubers)
  organs
caption: 'Blue arrows indicate the starch biosynthesis and sugar metabolism pathways;
  black arrows, the starch degradation pathway. Starch degradation in leaves and starch
  biosynthesis in tubers are shown in more detail. The red arrow indicates the alternative
  pathway of ADP-glucose synthesis in cytosol and subsequent transport to amyloplasts
  performed by BT1 (Brittle1-like transporter). Carbohydrates are shown in black:
  Fru, fructose; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; Glc, glucose; G1P, glucose-1-phosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; S6P, sucrose-6-phosphate; TrioseP, triose phosphate; ADP-Glc,
  ADP-glucose; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose. Enzymes and invertase inhibitor (in blue): AcInv,
  vacuolar acid invertase; AGPase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; ALD, aldolase; AMY,
  α-amylase; BAM, β-amylase; FK, fructokinase; DPE, 4-α-glucanotransferase; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase;
  GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase; GWD, α-glucan water dikinase; HK, hexokinase;
  ISA, isoamylase; InvInh, invertase inhibitor; Inv, invertase; PGI, phosphoglucoisomerase;
  PGM, phosphoglucomutase; PHO, α-glucan phosphorylase; PPase, inorganic pyrophosphatase;
  PWD, phosphoglucan water dikinase; SBE, starch-branching enzyme; SEX, LSF, phosphoglucan
  phosphatases; SPP, sucrose phosphate phosphatase; SPS, sucrose phosphate synthase;
  SS, starch synthase; SuSy, sucrose synthase; UGPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.
  Transporter proteins (in green): GPT, glucose-6-phosphate translocator; NTT, ATP-ADP
  antiporter; MEX, maltose transporter; TPT, triose phosphate/phosphate translocator;
  GlcT, glucose transporter; BT1L, Brittle1-like transporter.'
