caption: Effects of chronic cold stress on the expression of key genes and proteins
  in the TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway in the intestinal mucosa of pigs. (A,B) The
  mRNA expression of TLR4 and MyD88 in intestinal mucosa of Min pigs (n = 6). (C,D)
  The mRNA expression of key genes of pyroptosis in the intestinal mucosa of Min pigs
  (n = 6). (E,F) The mRNA expression of TLR4 and MyD88 in intestinal mucosa of Yorkshire
  pigs (n = 6). (G,H) The mRNA expression of key genes of pyroptosis in the intestinal
  mucosa of Yorkshire pigs (n = 6). (I,J) The expression of TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway-related
  proteins in the jejunal mucosa of Yorkshire pigs (n = 6). Data are presented as
  the means Â± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
