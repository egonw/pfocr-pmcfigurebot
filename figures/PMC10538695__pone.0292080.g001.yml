figure_title: EIF3A HLH motif regulates translation of proliferation-associated mRNAs
caption: A. Schematic of eIF3 binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit in canonical and
  viral IRES-mediated initiation complexes based on cryo-EM reconstructions [, ].
  B. In vitro translation of IRES-Renilla mRNA in CT and HLH* extracts. Data represent
  mean Â± S.D., n = 3 replicates. C. Representative alignment of RNAseq CT and HLH
  reads to wild type (wt) or HLH* (mut) EIF3A sequences. D. Translational efficiency
  scatter plot of statistically significant transcripts (p-value < 0.01 and >10 reads
  per transcript in the RNA-Seq analysis). Upregulated transcripts highlighted in
  gold (>2.5x increase), downregulated in blue (>2.5x decrease). E. KEGG Pathway enrichment
  analysis of downregulated transcripts, ranked by Enrichr generated Z-score (p-value
  listed next to bars) []. Genes corresponding to enriched categories are listed on
  the right. F. Representative western blot validation of top cancer associated hits
  in shRNA HEK293T cell lines. Protein quantification normalized to ACTB or HSP90
  loading control and relative amounts indicated below corresponding bands. G. Representative
  Western blot in CRISPRi HEK293T cell lines. Protein quantification normalized to
  ACTB or HSP90 loading control and relative amounts indicated below corresponding
  bands. New MET antibody produced a double band not previously seen (see ).
