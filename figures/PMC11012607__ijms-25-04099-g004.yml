caption: Metabolic pathway to produce PUFA (ω3 and ω6); roles of pro- and anti-inflammatory
  fatty acids. From ALA and LA, ELOVL2 and 5, Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases produce LC-PUFA.
  From LC-PUFA, ELOVL1, 3 and 4 produce VLC-PUFA. β-oxidation can occur and lead to
  the production of DHA or its ω6 equivalent. ω3 PUFA are mostly anti-inflammatory,
  while ω6 PUFA are mostly pro-inflammatory. Modified from [].
