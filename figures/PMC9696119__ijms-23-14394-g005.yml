caption: Innate Recognition and Interferon Signaling by Coronaviruses. Upon binding
  to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and subsequent sensing of coronaviruses
  by various pathogen recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (RIG-I, MDA5), activation
  of transcription factors nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factor
  3 and 7 (IRF3, IRF7) stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  type I and III interferons (IFNs), respectively. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway
  is activated by IFNs through autocrine and paracrine secretion to induce the expression
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Type I IFNs and IFN III IFNs are both capable of
  inducing ISGs, but type I IFN signaling produces a stronger and faster response
  as well as inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, delayed
  IFN-I responses not only fail to control SARS-CoV-2 virus but can also cause chronic
  inflammation and tissue damage.
