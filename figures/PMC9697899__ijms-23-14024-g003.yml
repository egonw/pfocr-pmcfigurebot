caption: 'Effect of MG against UC caused by DSS. (A) Modeling and drug administration
  scheme of MG in DSS-induced mice. (B) The changes in body weight from each group
  of mice were measured. (C) Disease activity index (DAI) during the disease process.
  (D,E) Colon length of representative mice among different treatment groups. (F)
  Representative sections of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining images of colon
  tissue (40×, scale bar: 400 μm) (200×, scale bar: 100 μm). Asterisks indicate interstitial
  lymphocytes infiltrated and clustered, black arrows indicate basal layer thickening
  and villous defects, green arrows indicate shortening, branching, and coiling of
  crypt structures. *** p < 0.001 vs. the normal group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and
  ### p < 0.001 vs. the group treated with the DSS group.'
