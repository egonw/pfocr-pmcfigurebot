caption: LOX expression is markedly elevated in fibrotic kidneys and responsible for
  collagen over cross‐linking. (A) Venn diagram showing the number of up‐regulated
  (Upper panel) or down‐regulated genes (bottom panel) in UUO mice and FA‐tread mice
  detected from bioinformatic analysis of RNA‐seq data. (B)The number of fibrosis‐associated
  gens detected from UUO mice and FA‐tread mice overlap of up‐regulated and down‐regulated
  genes identified by RNA‐seq. (C) Hierarchical clustering of the top 10 differential
  expression genes (DEGs) related fibrosis in these two models. The gene expression
  was quantified via RSEM v1.2.12 with the default options. The “value” stands for
  FPKM (FA‐treated mice) and cpmlog (UUO mice) expression of DEG. (D) Representative
  images of immunostaining with LOX antibody in kidney sections from patients with
  and without renal fibrosis. (E) Western blot analysis of LOX, elastin, and Col1
  levels in kidneys collected from IRI‐, UUO‐ and FA‐ mice. (F) The ratio of insoluble/soluble
  collagen was analyzed in kidneys collected from IRI‐, UUO‐ and FA‐mice. ANS, hypertensive
  nephrosclerosis; DN, diabetic nephropathy; MCD, minimal change disease; MN, membranous
  nephropathy. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM for groups of at least 6 mice in
  vivo. The scale bar is 50 μm.
