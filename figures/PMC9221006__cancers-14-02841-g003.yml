caption: Overview of the mechanisms by which JMJD2D promotes CRC progression. Intestinal
  inflammation can trigger immune cells to release TNFα to upregulate JMJD2D in colorectal
  cells by activating NF-κB signaling. Highly expressed JMJD2D cooperates with Gli1/2
  and β-catenin to promote the expression of various oncogenes, resulting in tumorigenesis.
  JMJD2D cooperates with c-Fos and SOX9to promote the expression of HIF1α and HIF1β,
  respectively. Subsequently, JMJD2D serves as a coactivator to promote the transcription
  of tumor glycolysis-related genes by elevating the HIF1α/β signaling. Again, JMJD2D
  cooperates with SP-1 to promote the expression of IFNGR1, which helps to maintain
  the signal that IFNγ triggers the upregulation of PD-L1 through the JAK-STAT3 pathway.
  Importantly, JMJD2D can cooperate with STAT3 and IRF1 to promote PD-L1 transcription.
  Subsequently, tumor cells antagonize the activation and effector functions of CD8+
  T cells by activating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signals through highly expressed PD-L1.
