caption: Changes in hindlimb blood flow in mice. (a) Representative blood flow images
  of hindlimbs of mice on days 0, 7, and 14. (b) A comparison of blood flow values
  of the left and right hindlimbs between the groups on the same day of the operation.
  (c) A comparison of blood flow values of the left and right hindlimbs between the
  groups on the 7th day. (d) A comparison of blood flow values of the left and right
  hindlimbs between the groups on the 14th day. Scale bar = 2 cm; CON, control group;
  ISC, ischemic group; BPS, sodium beraprost; L low dose of RJQM; M medium dose of
  RJQM; and H high dose of RJQM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. The data are expressed
  as ± standard error of the mean (SEM) (n = 10 in each group).
