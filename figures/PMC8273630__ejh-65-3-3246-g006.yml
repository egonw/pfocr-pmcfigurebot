caption: 'NOP14 modulate the NRIP1/GSK-3β/β-catenin signalling pathway in HT29 cells.
  A) Cultured HT29 cells were transfected with NOP14 overexpression (GFP-NOP14) or
  knockdown (shNOP14) plasmids; cell lysates were collected for Western blotting analysis.
  B) Data from A were quantified with Image J. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared
  with the GFP group; #p<0.05, ##p<0.01, ###p<0.001 compared with the shNC group.'
article_title: NOP14 regulates the growth, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer
