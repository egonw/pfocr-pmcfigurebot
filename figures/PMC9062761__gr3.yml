caption: RNA sequencing identifies transcripts with altered methylation in osteosarcoma.
  a. Volcano plots for ALKBH5 overexpression KHOS cells versus controls. Significantly
  upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) transcripts are shown (|logFC| > 1,
  P < 0.001, FDR < 0.01). b. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) validated enrichment
  of cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumor-related pathway. c. A heatmap showing changes
  in representative cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis related genes and
  pathways, including STAT3. d. By western blot, it was found that downstream targets
  of STAT3 (CyclinD1,c-Myc and bcl-2)showed decreased activation in the cells relative
  to control.
