caption: Intrathecal AAV-CM suppressed EAE in an IFNAR-dependent manner. C57BL/6 or
  IFNAR1-deficient mice were immunized with MOGp35–55 to induce EAE and at disease
  onset, they received intrathecal AAV-CM, AAV-GFP or PBS, and clinical signs were
  scored daily. (A) Mice that received AAV-CM showed marked attenuation of the disease
  compared to the control mice. Sick mice treated with intrathecal AAV-GFP showed
  similar symptoms to those in PBS-treated mice (n = 12–22 in each group). The data
  were pooled from three independent studies. (B) The protective effect of intrathecal
  AAV-CM was abrogated in IFNAR1-KO mice. (n = 4–5 per group). Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. The results were analyzed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney u-test.
