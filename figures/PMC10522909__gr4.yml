caption: 'Heat maps of upstream modulators and DEGs involved in the early and late
  biological processes after FS or SPS&FS exposure. (A) We identified genes of upstream
  modulators that may play critical roles in the early and late biological processes
  after FS or SPS&FS exposure. (B) Early responsive DEGs involved in EIF2 signaling,
  NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, and acute phase responding signaling. (C)
  Late responsive DEGs involved in the sirtuin signaling pathway, STAT3 pathway, and
  cAMP pathway. Con: control group, ST: short-term (<2Â h after FS or SPS&FS exposure);
  LT: long-term (7 days after FS or SPS&FS exposure).'
