caption: Expression patterns of differentially expressed genes related to MAPK signaling
  pathway during salt stress. The color scale corresponds to log2âˆ’ transformed (fragments
  per kilobyte per million reads) FPKM values with red indicating upregulation and
  green indicating downregulation. Each row represents a unigene. Control and NaCl
  represented different treatments.
