caption: Overexpression of Ly6D favors chemoresistance in LSCC cells. (A, B) Tu686
  and CAL27 cells were stably transduction of psin-flag or psin-flag-Ly6D plasmid
  and then the levels of Ly6D were analyzed by western blot (A) and qPCR analysis
  (B). (C, D) Tu686 (C) and CAL27 cells (D) were stably expressing flag-Ly6D in the
  presence of various concentrations of chemotherapy drugs for 24 h. Relative cell
  survival was detected by CCK8. (E) Tu686 cells with stable overexpression of Ly6D
  were exposed to cisplatin (20 μM) for 24 h. Then cell viability was measured by
  EdU assay. (F) Colony formation assay of Tu686 cells with stable overexpression
  of Ly6D in the presence of cisplatin (20 μM).
