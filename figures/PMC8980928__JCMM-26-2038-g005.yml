caption: ST‐EVs inhibit the cell viability of chondrocytes and promote apoptosis.
  Normal chondrocytes were incubated with different concentrations of ST‐EVs (1, 5,
  10 × 107/ml) for 24 h. (A) the cell viability was evaluated using the CCK‐8 assay;
  (B,C) the apoptotic rate of chondrocytes was detected by Annexin‐V—PI Apoptosis
  Detection Kit and analysed with FlowJo software. N = 3, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01
