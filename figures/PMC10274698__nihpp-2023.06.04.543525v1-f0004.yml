figure_title: The DGAT2 enzyme is required for Aβ-induced LD formation, and inhibiting
  it restores Aβ phagocytosis in microglia
caption: 'a. Proposed mechanism for Aβ-induced LD formation in microglia. Microglial
  exposure to Aβ induces an upregulation of FFAs that are converted to TAGs within
  LDs via the DGAT2 pathway. b. Immunofluorescence staining of microglia (IBA1), LDs
  (LipidTox), DGAT2, and Aβ plaques (MO4) in the hippocampal subicular region of 5xFAD
  and WT mouse brains. Increased DGAT2 is shown in microglia associated with amyloid
  plaques. c. Quantification showing a significant increase in % of DGAT2+ microglia
  out of all microglia and out of all DGAT2+ cells in the mouse subiculum in the 5xFAD
  tissue vs. WT; *P= 0.0181, ***P= 0.0002. Data represent mean ± SD. Unpaired t-test,
  N=3 mice per group. d. DGAT2 inhibitor (D2i) treatment reduced LDs in cultured microglia
  from WT and 5xFAD brains; ***P= 0.0001, **P= 0.0029. e. Quantification showed that
  D2i treatment reduced LD formation upon Aβ exposure in microglia from WT mice but
  not in cells from 5xFAD mice; ***P= 0.0001. f. Representative dot plots showing
  LD and AβpH uptake by microglia treated with D2i from WT and 5xFAD mice. g. LD+
  microglia from WT mice showed a slight but non-significant increase in AβpH uptake
  with D2i, while LD+ microglia from 5xFAD mice showed a significant increase in AβpH
  uptake with D2i; ****P= 0.000014. h. Direct comparison of the effect of D2i treatment
  on AβpH uptake by LD+ microglia from WT and 5xFAD showed that inhibiting DGAT2 restored
  the phagocytic performance of 5xFAD microglia, making it comparable to that of WT
  cells. For d, e, g and h: Data represent mean ± SD. Unpaired t-tests, cells were
  pooled from 3 mice per group (3 WT and 3 5xFAD mice) for each of the N=3 experiments.
  i. DGAT2 expression in LD+ microglia in close proximity to amyloid plaques in hippocampal
  FFPE tissue from human AD and NS cases (N=4 per group). Immunofluorescence was performed
  on 15μm-thick human hippocampal sections for the detection of DGAT2, lipid droplets
  (PLIN2), amyloid plaques (AmyloGlo) and microglia (IBA1). Increased DGAT2 signal
  (yellow) was detected in plaque-proximal LD+ microglia in AD cases (arrows), compared
  to NS controls. Cross-sections of the selected microglial cells in the white boxes
  demonstrate representative example of increased DGAT2 signal in close proximity
  to a large PLIN2-labeled LD inside a plaque-proximal microglial cell in AD, and
  of a cell from a non-symptomatic case.'
