caption: Energy metabolism-related pathways with regulatory functions in germ cells.
  Metabolic pathways and metabolic enzymes/metabolites are highlighted by outlined
  characters with a gray background and bold characters, respectively. G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; FAO, fatty acid
  oxidation; PUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; Ac-CoA,
  acetyl CoA; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; NAD(H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; MPC, mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; HBP,
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; SGOC, serine-glycine-one carbon pathway; ETC, electron
  transport chain.
