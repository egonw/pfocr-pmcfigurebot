caption: 'Effects of ICA on impaired insulin signaling in the cerebral cortex of 3×Tg-AD
  mice.(A) Insulin signaling: IR tyrosine autophosphorylation is stimulated by insulin
  and triggers IRS1 phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, which represents a positive
  regulatory mechanism that activates the PI3K/AKT pathway and results in the inhibition
  of GSK3β. However, serine phosphorylation of IRS1 at specific sites is a negative
  regulatory mechanism. (B) Representative expression patterns of molecules related
  to the insulin signaling pathway. (C) Quantification of proteins related to the
  insulin signaling pathway shown in (B). Protein levels were normalized to those
  in the WT + vehicle group. The data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 4–6).
  *P < 0.05, vs. WT + vehicle group; #P < 0.05, vs. 3×Tg-AD + vehicle group (one-way
  analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference test). 3×Tg-AD:
  A triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease; AKT: protein kinase B; GAPDH:
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta;
  ICA: icariin; IR: insulin receptor; IRS1: insulin receptor substrate 1; p: phosphorylation;
  PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate;
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  WT: wild-type.'
