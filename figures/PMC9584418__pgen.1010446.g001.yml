figure_title: Mup1 accumulates on vacuole membranes in vps36Δ cells after addition
  of methionine
caption: (A) Illustration describing how surface ESCRT-client proteins like Mup1 may
  be rerouted to the vacuole membrane and ILF pathway for degradation when MVB formation
  is blocked. (B) Fluorescence and DIC micrographs showing route taken by Mup1-GFP
  from the plasma membrane to the vacuole lumen in response to methionine over 30
  minutes in live wild type or vps36Δ cells stained with FM4-64. (C) Proportion of
  wild type or vps36Δ cells that show Mup1-GFP fluorescence on the plasma membrane
  (PM), intracellular puncta, vacuole membrane (Vac mem) or vacuole lumen over time
  after methionine addition. n values for wild type (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 min) are 242,
  327, 229, 267, 266 cells; vps36Δ are 216, 216, 214, 196, 222 cells. (D) Fluorescence
  and DIC micrographs of live wild type or vps36Δ cells stained with FM4-64 expressing
  Mup1-pHluorin before or 10 minutes after addition of methionine. (E) Proportion
  of wild type or vps36Δ cells that show Mup1-pHluorin fluorescence on the plasma
  membrane (PM) or vacuole membranes (VM) before or 10 minutes after methionine addition.
  Micrographs show Mup1-pHluorin location within cells. n values for wild type are
  318, 304 cells; vps36Δ are 324, 348 cells analyzed before or after methionine addition
  respectively. Means ± S.E.M. and results from Student t-test are shown. Cells were
  stained with FM4-64 to label vacuole membranes. Arrowheads indicate Mup1-GFP or
  Mup1-pHluorin on vacuole membranes. Scale bars, 2 μm.
