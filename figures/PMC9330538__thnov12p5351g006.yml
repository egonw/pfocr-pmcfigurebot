caption: Differences between metastatic phenotype switches due to distinct alterations
  in gene expression. (A) Protein-protein interaction network of genes identified
  as overexpressed in the tumors accomplishing intravasation, extravasation, metastatic
  growth is shown. The network nodes are colored by their pathway membership and the
  interactions between nodes are colored by type, as listed in the respective legends.
  (B) The results of leave-one-mouse-out random forest classification of the spectra
  from tumors obtained by silencing TWIST1, FOXC2, and CXCR3 expression in 4T1 cells
  are shown. The overall class prediction in the bottom row for each mouse is obtained
  by thresholding on the prediction frequencies of the three classes in the labeled
  intermediate rows. (C) Representative photographs of metastatic lungs of mice harboring
  tumors obtained by silencing TWIST1, FOXC2, and CXCR3 expression in 4T1 cells are
  shown along with their corresponding controls.
