caption: Dynamic culture in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor promotes production
  of angiogenic cytokines from a three-dimensional cardiac tissue derived from human-induced
  pluripotent stem cells (3D-hiPSC-CT), and it upregulates the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway via integrin(A and B) Concentrations of vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (A) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (B) (mean
  ± SE) in the culture supernatant of RWV and control groups (n = 5 per group). Independent
  experiments, one-tailed Student’s t test. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.(C) Representative
  western blots (WB) for integrin α7, integrin β1, phosphorylated and total focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphorylated and total AKT, phosphorylated and total mTOR,
  phosphorylated and total S6K, and GAPDH from 3D-hiPSC-CTs.(D) Quantification of
  protein expression (mean ± SE) from WB by densitometry, normalized to GAPDH, and
  the quantified ratio of phosphorylated/total protein for each kinase in (C) normalized
  to those of the control group (n = 5 per group). Independent experiments, one-tailed
  Student’s t test. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. n.s., not significant.
