caption: ROS and the tumor microenvironment. (1) Within the tumor microenvironment,
  tumor cells are able to survive by presenting oncogenic mutations such as that generated
  by Nrf2. (a) In the tumor cell cytosol, increased ROS levels prevent Nrf2 degradation
  mediated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). (b) In the absence of ROS,
  Nrf2 will be degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. (c) When separated from
  KEAP1, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus of the tumor cell where, together with Maf
  proteins, it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and allows the expression
  of genes that code for the generation of antioxidant enzymes. (d) The tumor cell
  expresses NADPH-generating enzymes such as ME1, IDH1, and G6PD. (2) (a) Treg cells
  are susceptible to ROS-induced death. (b) A dead Treg cell will give way to the
  release of ATP. (c) ATP will be metabolized to adenosine (ADO) by CD39 AND CD73
  of another Treg cell. (d) The generation of ADO is one of the suppression mechanisms
  of the antitumor immune response promoted by Treg cells because of the binding to
  the A2AR of effector T lymphocytes (Teff) and APCs as it generates immunosuppressive
  signals.
