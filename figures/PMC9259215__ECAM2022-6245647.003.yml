caption: FSCN1 promotes glycolysis in prostate cancer cells. (a–d) Determination of
  the glucose consumption (a), lactate production (b), ECAR (c), and extracellular
  pH (d) in PC-3 cells in the si-NC, si-FSCN1#1, and si-FSCN1#2 groups, ∗P < 0.05
  and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs si-NC; E-H, assay of the glucose consumption (e), lactate production
  (f), ECAR (g), and extracellular pH in DU145 cells in the mock group and the FSCN1
  group (h), ∗∗P < 0.01.
