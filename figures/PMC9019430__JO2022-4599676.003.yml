caption: 'miR-196-5p promotes proliferation and migration of HuCCT1 in a HAND1 and
  activation manner. (a) and (b) The effect of HAND1 or β-catenin depletion on the
  proliferation capacity of HuCCT1 in vitro was detected using EdU (a [upper]), colony
  formation (a [lower]), and CCK-8 assay (b). The downregulated cell proliferation
  of HuCCT1 was reversed by HAND1 knockdown or β-catenin silencing. HAND1 OE: HAND1
  overexpression; HAND1 KD: HAND1 knockdown. ∗∗∗ There is a statistical significance
  between the EdU positive cell percentage in blue, compared to red or green group.
  Scale bars, 100 μm. (c) and (d) Migration and matrigel invasion assays were performed
  to detect the effect of HAND1 or β-catenin depletion on cell migration and invasion
  in HuCCT1. ∗∗∗ There is a statistical significance between the EdU positive cell
  percentage in blue, compared to red or green group. Scale bars, 150 μm. Blue panel:
  Inhi-miR-196-5p, red panel: Inhi-miR-196-5p + HAND1 KD, green panel: Inhi-miR-196-5p+si-β-catenin,
  purple panel: HAND1 OE.'
