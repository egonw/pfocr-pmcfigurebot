figure_title: A shift in the leading pacemaker and earliest atrial activation sites
  in the human SAN model with varying Ado concentration
caption: A, Increasing the presence of Ado (from 0% to 100%) in the computer model
  of the human SAN complex led to a shift in the leading pacemaker and earliest atrial
  activation sites, eventually exit block and complete atrial arrest (100% of Ado).
  B, A similar shift in the leading pacemaker and earliest atrial activation sites
  was observed in 11 optically mapped human hearts ex-vivo in the absence and presence
  of Ado []. The increasing dose of Ado led to a heart-specific pacemaker shift toward
  the head or tail of the SAN complex, and a higher chance of conducting via superior
  or inferior lateral SACPs as in computer model. Also, 100 μM Ado led to cardiac
  or SAN arrest in five out of the 11 hearts. SAN–sino-atrial node, SCL–sinus cycle
  length, SACP–sino-atrial conduction pathway, SACTsr–sinoatrial conduction time during
  sinus rhythm, Ado–Adenosine.
