figure_title: Antioxidant effects of CA on H2O2-induced murine LMSCs
caption: '(A) The effects of various doses of H2O2 on cell viability. Data were obtained
  from seven independent experiments; **P < 0.01 versus 0 µM H2O2 group. (B) The protective
  effects of CA on H2O2-induced cells. Data were obtained from nine independent experiments;
  @P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, and **P < 0.01 versus H2O2 group. (C) Total SOD levels of
  groups. (D) Intracellular ROS production of each group. (E) Apoptosis rates of groups.
  Data were obtained from three independent experiments; #P < 0.01 versus CTRL groups;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus H2O2 groups; &P < 0.05 versus NAC groups; @P > 0.05
  versus 50 µM CA groups.'
