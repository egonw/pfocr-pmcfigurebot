caption: Biosynthetic profiles of Cannabis cultivars. (a) Cultivar-normalized expression
  heatmap of significantly regulated genes encoding metabolic enzymes involved in
  cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis. The heatmap is based on the total expression
  values of genes that encode enzymes with the same products. The total gene expression
  values (TMM as units) are also given in each cell. Note that ALDH is associated
  with both NAD(P)H compensation and the hexanoate pathway. (b) Similar heatmap for
  key TPSs, including those shortlisted for functional validation. For the full names
  for all enzymes and metabolites, refer to  and . Refer to  for the gene IDs involved.
