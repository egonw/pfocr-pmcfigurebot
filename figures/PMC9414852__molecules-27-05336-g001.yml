caption: MOBT alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. (A) Molecular formula of MOBT
  and schematic illustration of MOBT administrated into mice. (B) The MicroCT imaging
  system for small animals displayed that the plain scan of the lung window in the
  sham group showed the texture of both lungs was clear, and no exudation or space
  occupying lesions were found in the lung parenchyma. The MOBT alone had no obvious
  changes compared with the sham group. However, both lower lungs of the mice in the
  BLM group showed diffused reticular blurring and interstitial changes. Meanwhile,
  the BLM + MOBT treatment group significantly reduced the lesion range of reticular
  changes. (C) The body weight monitoring revealed that mouse weight in the BLM group
  was significantly reduced compared with the sham group, whereas in the MOBT group
  it was increased compared with the BLM group. (D) The result of mice lung function
  showed that MOBT treatment improved the FVC. (E) H&E and Masson staining demonstrated
  that a portion of the alveolar structure was damaged, alveolar fusion, and collagen
  fibers were gathered in the lung of the BLM mice compared with the sham group, whereas
  MOBT alone group was similar to the sham. The BLM + MOBT treatment improved the
  alveolar structure and attenuated collagen deposition. (F) The Western blot demonstrated
  that MOBT inhibited the fibrotic protein expression, including collagen I, vimentin,
  and α-SMA compared with those in the BLM-treated group. (G) Western blot demonstrated
  that MOBT inhibited the expression of TGF-β1, CTGF, and VEGF, which are cytokines
  related to fibrosis, compared with those in the BLM group. Each bar represents mean
  ± SD, n = 6, * p < 0.05.
