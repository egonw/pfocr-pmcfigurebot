caption: Neural differentiation of lt-NES cells is characterized by changes in metabolic
  pathway gene expression and increasing resistance to stress. (A) Phase contrast
  picture and a representative immunofluorescence staining of 8-week-differentiated
  lt-NES cells stained for MAP2 and GFAP. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B) Principal component
  analysis of differential gene expression in lt-NES cultures differentiated for 4,
  6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks based on 1919 variables, showing clustering of the samples
  according to differentiation time. (C) Heatmap of glucose metabolism-associated
  gene expression showing upregulation of neuron-specific glycolysis genes (e.g.,
  PKM, G6PD, ENO1) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-associated genes (e.g., TKT,
  PGLS) with time of differentiation. Data were generated using an Affymetrix transcriptome
  microarray (n = 2). (D) Resistance to TBHP treatment increases with differentiation.
  Proliferating and differentiated lt-NES cells were treated with TBHP for 24 h. Toxicity
  was assessed by ATPlite assay at the end of the treatment phase with the indicated
  concentrations. Shown are measurements of the response to TBHP (after 24 h) of undifferentiated,
  4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks differentiated lt-NES cells, presented as percentages relative
  to untreated cells (equal to 100%). Data are presented as means ± SEM (n ≥ 3 per
  differentiation time point, consisting of at least 4 technical replicates each).
