caption: KL and KL1 partially mimic the hippocampal metabolome of cognitive (Cog)
  stimulation and correlate with cognitive performance. A, Venn diagram showing the
  overlap between differentially expressed metabolites between KL- and KL1-treated
  mice. Over 50% of klotho-mediated metabolic changes were recapitulated with KL1
  treatment. B, Venn diagram showing the overlap among differentially expressed metabolites
  in the cognitively stimulated, KL-treated, and KL1-treated mice. Twenty-seven percent
  of KL-induced metabolites and 37% of KL1-induced metabolites overlapped with cognitive
  stimulation. C, IPA canonical pathway analysis of the overlapping metabolites among
  cognitive stimulation, KL, and KL1 shows that a subset (shown) are identical metabolic
  pathways compared with cognitive stimulation. D, Diagram of approach of mapping
  cognitive performance to hippocampal metabolomics to generate a metabolic signature
  of cognition. E, Heatmap of the signature of six common metabolites shared among
  cognitive stimulation, KL treatment, and KL1 treatment. The signature was used to
  generate a metabolic score, and cognitively stimulated mice showed an increased
  metabolic score. Deg, Degradation.
