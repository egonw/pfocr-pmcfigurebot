caption: The model of moderation analysis. The moderation analysis was performed based
  on Model 1 in the PROCESS macro using SPSS statistical software (version 3.5 by
  Andrew Hayes, http://www.afhayes.com). According to this model of moderated multiple
  regression, for each PD patient, the outcome variable (labelled Y) was quantified
  clinical symptoms, the predictor or independent variable (labelled X) was a QSM
  measure derived from each ROI as defined in the Methods section, and the moderator
  variable (labelled M) was specified for smoking status (yes/no). PD, Parkinson’s
  disease; QSM, quantitative susceptibility mapping; ROI, regions of interest.
article_title: The protective role of cigarette smoking against Parkinson’s disease
  via moderation of the interaction between iron deposition in the nigrostriatal pathway
  and clinical symptoms.
