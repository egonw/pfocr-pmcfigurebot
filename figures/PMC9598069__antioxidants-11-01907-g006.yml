caption: 'NAC prevented the induction of autophagy in the HGnFs under low glucose
  conditions and inhibited the phosphorylation of the ROS-Akt/ERK signaling pathway.
  (A,B) Synthesis of autophagy-related proteins (Total-LC3B and p62) in the HGnFs
  after 24, 72, and 120 h of incubation under low glucose conditions following the
  addition of NAC. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. (C–E) LC3B and p62 expression
  were analyzed using western blot, performed on protein extracts from these cells
  with antibodies against the described proteins and β-actin serving as a loading
  control. (F–H) The protein expression of the ROS-Akt/ERK signaling pathway was evaluated
  using western blotting analysis and quantified using ImageJ. Western blot analysis
  was performed on protein extracts of these cells with antibodies against the indicated
  proteins and β-actin as a loading control. The samples derived from the same experiment
  and the gels/blots were processed in parallel. The expression levels of Akt, p-Akt,
  ERK, and p-ERK were measured by densitometric analysis using ImageJ. (Scale bar:
  100 μm.).'
