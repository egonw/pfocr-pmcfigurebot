caption: 'BTA07 inhibited H/R-induced apoptosis in ARCMs via the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. (A,B) Expression of Bax and Bcl-2 were measured by Western blot. (C) Caspase-3
  activity in ARCMs. (D) Effects of BTA07 on ARCMs caspase-3 activity after H2O2 was
  induced. Data are presented as means ± S.E.M for three independent experiments.
  #### p < 0.0001 vs. normoxia group; **** p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle group; *** p < 0.001
  vs. vehicle group; $$ p < 0.01 vs. BTA07 group; one–way ANOVA test, followed by
  a Student–Newman–Keuls test.'
