caption: Isorhamnetin prevented ZEA-induced steroid secretion disorder in a PI3K/Akt-dependent
  manner. Ovarian GC were cultured with isorhamnetin (20 μmol/L) for 2 h with or without
  LY294002 (20 μmol/L), before treatment with ZEA (60 μmol/L) for 24 h. (A) Western
  blot analysis of FSHR and CYP19A1 in ovarian GC treated with ZEA or isorhamnetin.
  (B to C) The average optical density value of FSHR and CYP19A1 normalized to β-actin.
  (D) The content of estrogen (E2) in ovarian GC treated with ZEA, isorhamnetin or
  LY294002. (E to H) The mRNA expression of FSHR, ER2, CYP19A1 and ER1 were tested
  by an RT-PCR assay. Data are expressed as means ± SEM. Different letters mean significant
  differences (P < 0.05). ZEA = zearalenone; PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase;
  Akt = protein kinase B; GC = granulosa cell; FSHR = follicle-stimulating hormone
  receptor; CYP19A1 = cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily a member 1.
