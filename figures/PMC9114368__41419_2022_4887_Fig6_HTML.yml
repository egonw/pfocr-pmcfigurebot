figure_title: circLIFR regulates GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway via sponging miR-624-5p
caption: A Schematic illustration showing the potential target genes of miR-624-5p
  as predicted by TarBase, Starbase, and TargetScan. B The matched sequence of miR-624-5p
  with the 3′UTR of Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and luciferase reporter assays
  verify the relationship between miR-624-5p and GSK-3β. C, D Rescue assays demonstrate
  that circLIFR can modulate the expression of GSK-3β via miR-624-5p. E, F Western
  blot analysis for β-catenin protein levels in protein lysates, isolated at the indicated
  time points from HCC cells treated with 10 μM cycloheximide. Data represent means ± SD
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.
