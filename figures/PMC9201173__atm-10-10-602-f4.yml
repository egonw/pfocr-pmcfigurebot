caption: Pathway analysis of LINC00092 co-expressed genes. (A) Bubble diagram of significant
  enrichment pathway in GO analysis. (B) Bubble plot of significant enrichment pathway
  in KEGG analysis. (C,D) The proliferation curves of HCC38 and T47D cells after transfection
  with pcDNA-LINC00092 or pcDNA-NC were determined by CCK-8 assay. (E,F) The cell
  cycle distributions of HCC38 and T47D cells were analyzed by FACS at 48 hours following
  transfection (n=3). Representative plots are shown. **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001. GO,
  Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; CCK-8, Cell Counting
  Kit-8; OD, optical density; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
