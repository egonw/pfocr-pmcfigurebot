caption: 'Exploratory biomarker analysis. (A) Landscape of genetic alterations in
  study samples obtained from 24 patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Top
  to bottom: non-synonymous tumor mutational burden (TMB) in the exome, response to
  the study treatment, durability of clinical response, subtype of gastric cancer
  defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), microsatellite stability, HER2 expression,
  PD-L1 positivity, ATM expression, homologous recombination repair status, somatic
  singe nucleotide variations in selected canonical oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes, mutational signatures of somatic mutations, and the proportion of single
  base substitution subtypes in each sample. Response was defined to be durable if
  treatment duration was more than 6 months. Samples with ATM loss and/or high HRD
  signature were considered to have deficient homologous recombination repair. We
  assessed the enrichment of mutation groups in responders or non-responders using
  two-tailed Studentâ€™s t-test. Genes are grouped by pathway or function. The corresponding
  log-transformed p values are illustrated on the right with bar plots: Black bars
  represent comparison of responders (PR) and progressors (SD, PD) and gray bars represent
  comparison of PR and PD. Significantly enriched mutation groups in responders are
  marked by asterisks (*). (B) The exonic tumor mutational burden in patients with
  PR, SD, and PD to the study treatment. The statistical significance of the differences
  was estimated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. (C) A scatter plot simultaneously
  demonstrating the PFS, x-axis, best response from baseline in tumor size (y-axis),
  ATM expression (color), and proportion of mutational signature attributable to deficient
  HRD signature, size). (D) Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS among study patients according
  to ATM expression and proportion of HRD signature. Samples with HRD signature proportion
  higher than the average were defined as those with high proportion of HRD signature
  (sig. HRDHi). (E) A forest plot demonstrating multivariate analysis of factors associated
  with PFS. HRs and corresponding p values were estimated using multivariate cox regression
  hazard model. CIN, chromosomal instability; CPS, combined positive score; GS, genomically
  stable; HR, homologous recombination; HRD, homologous recombination deficiency;
  mPFS, median progression-free survival; MSI, microsatellite instability; PD, progressive
  disease; PFS, progression-free survival; PR, partial response; SBS, single-base
  substitution; SD, stable disease; TMB, tumor mutational burden.'
