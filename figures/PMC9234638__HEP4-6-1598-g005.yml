caption: Transcriptomic differences between different stages of control and pediatric
  NAFLD. (A) Patients with NAFLD visualized by the top two components of partial least‐squares
  discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA). (B) Venn diagram showing the number of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in control versus indicated group. A total of 13,235 differentially
  regulated genes were identified between steatosis and control; 12,593 differentially
  regulated genes were identified between NASH and control. (C) Selected top enriched
  pathways grouped by biologic function. (D) Heatmap showing the normalized gene expression
  (represented by z‐score) of candidate NAFLD genes involved in “calcium signaling”
  and “insulin & glucose signaling.” (E) Pathway Enrichment Score (PES) of selected
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways in normal liver
  and indicated NAFLD grade. IL, interleukin; LXR, liver X receptor; NASH, nonalcoholic
  steatohepatitis; PXR, pregnane X receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDR, vitamin
  D receptor
