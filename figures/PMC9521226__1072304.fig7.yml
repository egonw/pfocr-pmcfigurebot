caption: 'TAL1 positive cells are characterized by a DNA repair signature and show
  increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. (A to C) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) showing significant enrichment of DNA repair pathway in (A) TA L1 -positive
  pro-T cells, (B) TAL1 -positive thymus cells compared to empty vector (EV) thymus
  cells or (C) TA L1 positive T-ALL with PI3K pathway activating mutations compared
  to TAL1 T-ALL without mutations in PI3K pathway. NES: normalized enrichment score;
  P: nominal P-value. (D to E) GSEA showing significant negative enrichment of (D)
  UV response and positive enrichment of (E) nucleotide excision repair genes in TA
  L1 -positive thymus cells compared to empty vector (EV) thymus cells. (F) Bar plots
  showing IC50 values for different pro-T cell conditions treated with PARP-inhibitor
  olaparib. P-values were calculated using the one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction
  to account for multiple comparisons. (G) Synergy matrix plots showing γ-scores for
  pro-T cells or Jurkat cells treated with dactolisib and olaparib (synergy score
  = the average γ-score for the whole range of concentrations shown in the synergy
  matrix).'
