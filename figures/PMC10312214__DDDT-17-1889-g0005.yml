caption: 'BER mediates autophagy and apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway. CAL-62 and BHT-101 cells were pretreated with 1 μMWOR (a PI3K inhibitor),
  4 μg/mlSC79 (an AKT activator), and 0.2 μM RA (anmTOR inhibitor) for 2 h prior to
  80 or 40 μM BBR treatment for 72 h. (A) Cells were treated with or without BER in
  combination with or without 1 μM WOR, and the levels of the apoptosis-related protein,
  cleaved PARP1, and the autophagy-related protein, LC3B, were determined by Western
  blot analysis. (B) Cells were treated as in A, and apoptosis was detected using
  flow cytometry. (C) Cells were treated with or without BER in combination with or
  without 4 μg/mL SC79, and the levels of the apoptosis-related protein, cleaved PARP1,
  and the autophagy-related protein, LC3B, were determined by Western blot analysis.
  (D) Cells were treated as in C, and apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry.
  (E) Cells were treated with or without BER in combination with or without 0.2 μM
  RA, and the levels of the apoptosis-related protein, cleaved PARP1, and the autophagy-related
  protein, LC3B, were determined by Western blot analysis. (F) Cells were treated
  as in E, and apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry analysis. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
  vs the control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs the BER group.'
