caption: c‐Rel regulates the ATM‐CHK2‐P53 DNA damage response axis. (A) Heatmap showing
  hepatic expression of DNA damage repair machinery measured by qPCR in acute DEN‐injured
  WT or Rel−/−  mice. (B) Western blot showing Chk2, p53, and c‐Rel expression compared
  with β‐actin loading control in DEN‐injured WT or Rel−/−  mice. (C) Schematic showing
  the ATM‐mediated DNA damage response pathway; proteins colored in red are differentially
  expressed in Rel−/−  versus WT hepatocytes. (D) Experimental timeline of in vitro
  hepatocyte γ‐irradiation/DEN injury. (E) Heatmap showing expression of Atm, Rad50,
  MRE11, NBS1, Chek2, Tp53, and Cdkn1a in γ‐irradiated WT or Rel−/−  hepatocytes.
  (F) ChIP analysis of c‐Rel enrichment at the Atm, Rad50, Chek2, and Tp53 promoters
  of untreated or γ‐irradiated WT hepatocytes. (G) Experimental timeline of Chk2 inhibitor
  (Chk2i) therapy in the acute DEN injury model. (H) Average percentage area of necrotic
  liver tissue and representative images of H&E‐stained liver sections in acute DEN‐injured
  WT or Rel−/−  mice treated ± Chk2i. Masking of necrotic tissue (lower right corner)
  is highlighted in red, blue denotes healthy liver tissue, and vessels are colored
  white. (I) Graph showing mean γH2AX positive hepatocytes in WT or Rel−/−  mice treated
  ± Chk2i. (J) Schematic showing that loss of c‐Rel sensitizes hepatocytes to DNA
  damaging agents. Failure to induce key genes in the DNA damage response pathway
  results in genomic instability and earlier onset of HCC development. The p values
  are calculated using a two‐way ANOVA with a Sidak post hoc test or paired t‐test.
  ATM, ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia‐telangiectasia, RAD3‐related; Chk2i,
  Chk2 inhibitor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
  WT, wild‐type.
