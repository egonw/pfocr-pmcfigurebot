caption: 'PGB protected primary RGCs from OGD/R injury via the Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin
  pathway. (A) IF identification of primary mice RGCs (40×). Scale bars: 50 µm. (B)
  Primary RGCs pretreated with PGB (50 µM, 100 µM, or 200 µM) for 24 hours were subjected
  to OGD/R. OGD/R induced a considerable decrease in cell viability, whereas PGB improved
  cell viability. The most significant improvement was observed at 100 µM. (C, D)
  Primary RGCs pretreated with MK2206 (5 µM) were treated with PGB (100 µM) for 24
  hours prior to the onset of OGD/R. The ROS level was measured through the fluorescent
  probe, DCFH-DA, and the ratio of ROS+ cells was measured. PGB pretreatment inhibited
  ROS generation, but MK2206 counteracted the effect. (40×). Scale bars: 50 µm. (E)
  Representative IF images of primary RGCs (40×). Scale bars: 50 µm. The ratios of
  RGCs expressing p-Akt, p-GSK3β, and β-catenin were downregulated after OGD/R, which
  was countered by PGB pretreatment. However, MK2206 decreased the ratios of positive
  cells (n = 6). *P < 0.05 versus control group; **P < 0.05 versus NaCl + OGD/R group;
  ***P < 0.05 versus PGB 100 µM + OGD/R group; ****P < 0.05 versus PGB + DMSO + OGD/R
