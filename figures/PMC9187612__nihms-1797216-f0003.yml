figure_title: E. coli mutants with altered metabolic byproducts delay C. elegans fertility
  and inhibit T. muris egg hatching
caption: E. (A) Experimental approach for in vitro hatching assay. (B) Percent in
  vitro hatched T. muris eggs after incubation with overnight cultures of the four
  E. coli mutants identified in the C. elegans screen or WT E. coli. Hatched eggs
  were checked using light microscopy at timepoints indicated (n = 4); h = hours.
  (C) Hatching rates for mixtures of WT E. coli and WT E. coli or either ΔfabH or
  ΔeutN overnight cultures in the ratios indicated. Total concentration of each mixture
  was maintained at 1× 108 CFU/mL (n = 3). (D) Hierarchical clustering of metabolites
  that were significantly (p < 0.05, Student’s t-test) downregulated (blue) or upregulated
  (red) in ΔfabH relative to WT. (E, F) Percent in vitro hatched T. muris eggs elicited
  by ΔfabH and cultures supplemented with (E) 500μM arginine or (F) 100μM ornithine
  where indicated (n=3). (G) Arginine biosynthesis pathway in E. coli. (H) Hatching
  rates elicited by ΔargE and ΔargH (n = 4). (I) Experimental approach for hatching
  assay in a transwell system. (J) Hatching quantified for eggs contained within a
  transwell chamber separated from bacterial culture in the outer chamber by a membrane
  with 0.4μm pores. Samples supplemented with ornithine as in (H) are indicated (n
  = 3). (B) One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of area under curve compared to WT.
  (C, E-F, H, J) One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post-test compared
  to WT. For all panels, measurements were taken from distinct samples. Circles represent
  mean of at least 3 technical replicates per independent experiment. Bars show means
  and SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. ns = not significant.
