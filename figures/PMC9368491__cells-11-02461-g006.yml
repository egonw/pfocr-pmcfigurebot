caption: Kv11.1 activation promotes β-catenin interaction with R-cadherin at sites
  of cell–cell contact. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DMSO or 50 μM NS1643 for
  48 h were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-β-catenin antibody covalently
  conjugated with magnetic beads. The pellets were washed, eluted, and labeled with
  TMT6plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set (as ). Labeled samples were analyzed via mass
  spectrometry. Protein intensity was normalized to β-catenin intensity. Data were
  processed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and a summary graph was generated
  using machine learning prediction. (B) Heat map of cytoskeleton-associated proteins
  calculated from the results of TMT labeling proteomics. Association of 11 proteins
  with β-catenin, which include actin crosslinking proteins and those associated with
  focal adhesion complexes increased in cells treated with NS1643. (C) Fold change
  of junctional proteins interacting with β-catenin in DMSO, and NS1643 treated cells
  from proteomics analysis. R-cadherin and desmosome-related proteins were shown to
  interact with β-catenin, and pulldown of these proteins increased in cells treated
  with NS1643, n = 3. (D) MDA-MB-231 cells that were untreated (CTL) or treated with
  DMSO or 50 μM NS1643 for 24 h were lysed and subjected to Western blotting. No change
  in R-cadherin expression was found in NS1643 treated cells, n = 3. (E) The expression
  of desmoglein-2, plakophilin, and desmoplakin-2 increased in cells treated with
  NS1643, whereas no effect was observed for desmoplakin-1 expression, n = 4. All
  data are mean ± SD, ns = not significant; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.001
  via t test.
