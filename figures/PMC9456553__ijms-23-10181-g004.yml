caption: 'The antioxidant osthole (OST) rescued the phenotypes of the IMD-treated
  fruit fly: (A) differentially expressed genes of the oxidative stress response pathway;
  (B) the rescued 25 Hz short-term facilitation (STF) of the neuromuscular junction;
  (C) the rescued retinal ∆VR and (D) RPA; (E) the rescued mechanosensory perception;
  (F) the rescued nociceptive perception. Error bar stands for standard error of the
  mean. The *, **, or *** denotes the p-value < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001 and n.s. for
  not significant of Student’s t-test (A); two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test (B); and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (C–F); IMD, imidacloprid
  of 0.125 mg/L; OST, osthole of 6 μg/mL; ∆VR, voltage change of electroretinogram;
  RPA, receptor potential amplitude.'
