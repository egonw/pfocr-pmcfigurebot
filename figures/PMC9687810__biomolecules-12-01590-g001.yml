caption: Metabolic reprogramming involved in PCa progression to CRPC. Alterations
  in Zinc-driven metabolism and AR pathway are observed as prostate cancer progresses
  to CRPC. Mechanisms of androgen resistance include AR promiscuity, amplification,
  gain of function and alternative splicing (Created with BioRender.com). T—testosterone;
  E—estrogen; P—progesterone; G—glucocorticoids.
