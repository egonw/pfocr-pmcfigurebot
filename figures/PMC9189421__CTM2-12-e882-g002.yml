caption: Genome‐wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens identified MDM2 as a potential therapeutic
  target for NSCLC. (A) Schematic diagram of the CRISPR/Cas9 screens. (B) The mutated
  status of lung cancer driver oncogenes in A549 and NCI‐H460 cell lines. (C) The
  scatterplot of sgRNAs reads count in A549 and NCI‐H460 cells. (D) Venn diagram depicting
  the NSCLC potential targets defined as the intersection of screening in A549 and
  NCI‐H460. (E) The KEGG enrichment analysis on the intersected targets of screening
  in A549 and NCI‐H460. (F) The list of potential targets based on cell cycle pathway.
  The top three candidates whose β score > −0.2 were highlighted in green. (G) The
  expression of MDM2 in TP53 wild‐type and TP53 mutant NSCLC tumour tissues. (H) Kaplan–Meier
  plots for MDM2 (217373_x_at) expression‐based overall survival analysis of lung
  adenocarcinoma. (I) Expression levels of MDM2 of sgctrl and MDM2 KO BEAS‐2B cells
  (lung epithelial cell line). (J) Alamar Blue assays were performed to determine
  the cell viability of sgctrl and MDM2 KO clones of BEAS‐2B cells. (K) Colony formation
  assays of sgctrl and MDM2 KO BEAS‐2B cells. Representative images (left) and quantification
  (right) are shown (n = 3)
