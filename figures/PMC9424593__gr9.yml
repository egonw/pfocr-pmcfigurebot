caption: Network analysis of DEGs from Ccnd1highand Ccnd1lowintra-tumoral myeloid
  cells. (A) Distinct transcriptional profiles of Ccnd1high and Ccnd1low intra-tumoral
  myeloid cells obtained from the CT26 tumor cell-bearing mouse model. Uniform manifold
  approximation and projection (UMAP) plot for myeloid cell subclusters. (B) Proportion
  of myeloid cluster 13 between the control and AB680-treated tumors. (C) UMAP plot
  for the expression of Ccnd1 and Entpd1 in myeloid cells. (D) Heat map representing
  cluster-specific gene expressions. (E) Volcano blot for Ccnd1low intra-tumoral myeloid
  cells, compared to Ccnd1high intra-tumoral myeloid cells. (F) UMAP plot for the
  expression of inflammatory response- and leukocyte migration-related genes. (G)
  Comparative scRNA-seq analysis of Ccnd1low intratumoral myeloid cells, as compared
  with Ccnd1high intratumoral myeloid cells. In the functional network, each node
  represents a GO biological pathway, and the edges indicate the relationships among
  biological pathways, based on kappa values.
