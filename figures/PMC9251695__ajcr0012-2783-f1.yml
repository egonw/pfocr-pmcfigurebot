caption: MIR210HG was a hypoxia-inducible and aberrantly upregulated lncRNA in CC.
  A. The Venn diagrams of the GEO dataset (GSE120675) revealed that four genes were
  identified that overlapped under different treatments of hypoxic pathway inhibition.
  B. qRT-PCR analysis showed MIR210HG was upregulated in CSCC tissues compared with
  normal cervical epithelial tissues. C. The expression level of MIR210HG in the TCGA
  database. D. Overall survival (OS) of high- and low-expression MIR210HG patients
  determined using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter website (http://kmplot.com/analysis/).
  E, F. MIR210HG were measured by qRT-PCR in samples derived from cells subjected
  to dose- and time- dependent hypoxia treatment. The asterisk (*) indicates P < 0.05.
