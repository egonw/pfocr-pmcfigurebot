caption: 'Analysis of the transcription- and transcription regulation-related genes
  in Chrysanthemum morifolium infected with the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus
  B (CVB-CN). a Expression profiles of the genes related to transcription and transcription
  regulation are shown using the heatmap. All the transcription- and transcription
  regulation-related genes were assigned to 13 gene ontology (GO) terms. b Significance
  analysis of 13 transcription- and transcription regulation-related GO terms following
  CVB-CN infection. The red box indicates significant GO terms. c The number of upregulated
  and downregulated genes that were grouped into GO:0006351, GO:0006355, and GO:0045892.
  d Relative expression levels of three representative defense-related transcription
  factor genes of C. morifolium following CVB-CN infection. The data are given as
  means ± standard deviation of three biological replicates. Significant differences
  in expression are indicated with asterisks: (*) P < 0.05 or (**) P < 0.01; Tukey′s
  test'
article_title: Integrated next-generation sequencing and comparative transcriptomic
  analysis of leaves provides novel insights into the ethylene pathway of Chrysanthemum
  morifolium in response to a Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B.
