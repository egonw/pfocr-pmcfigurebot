caption: The chromosomal location, expression characteristics of TMEM100 gene, and
  its correlation with clinicopathological features in PCa (A) The TMEM gene on Chr17.
  (B) TMEM100 expression profile across all tumor samples and normal tissues. (C)
  The difference expression of TMEM100 in PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues.
  (D) The difference expression of TMEM100 in PCa tissues and paired normal tissues.
  (E-G) Relative expression levels of TMEM100 in TCGA database with T stage (E), N
  stage (F), M stage (G). (H-I) Overall survival (H) and progress free interval (I)
  curve of PCa patients with low and high TMEM100 expression in TCGA database. (J)
  progress free interval in GEO database (GSE16560). (K) ROC curve showed the efficiency
  of TMEM100 expression level to distinguishing PCa tissue from non-tumor tissue (L)
  Western blot of TMEM100 protein expression in adjacant tissues and PCa tissues.
  (M) Representative IHC staining of TMEM100 in adjacant tissues, low-stage PCa, moderate-stage
  PCa and high-stage PCa and the quantitative evaluation of TMEM100 staining intensity.
  Scale bars = 200 μm or 50 μm, respectively. *<0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001.
