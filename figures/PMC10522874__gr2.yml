caption: The activation and inactivation of numerous signalling pathways occur during
  the cellular development of MSC-derived adipocytes. The BMP/Smad signalling pathway
  promotes adipogenesis by activating PPAR-ϒ, whereas C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression
  are raised at the commencement of adipogenesis to produce the adipocyte phenotype.
