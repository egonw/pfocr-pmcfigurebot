caption: 'Effect of stress on key brain regions. Stress induces NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation,
  triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), downregulates antioxidant enzymes and
  causes oxidative stress, or directly increases caspaes-3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio
  to promote the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, and finally leads to cognitive
  deficits. Stress causes anxiety and depression by leading to excitatory/inhibitory
  (E/I) neuron imbalance, increasing MDA, inhibiting GSH and SOD, destroying neuronal
  damage remodeling, and inhibiting the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway in the prefrontal cortex
  (PFC). In the hypothalamus, stress induces behavioral and cognitive deficits and
  psychiatric disorders by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
  oxidative stress, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuron or leading to
  the bidirectional changes of synaptic plasticity of neuron. In the amygdala, stress
  makes neuron damage by leading to the imbalance of E/I neuron, damaging of Na+,
  K+-ATPase caused by oxidative stress, and activating p-PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway-mediated
  astrocyte apoptosis, finally leading to anxiety. Note: UPR: unfolded protein response;
  GABA: glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GSH:
  glutathione; SOD: superoxide dismutase; MDA: malondialdehyde; PTSD: posttraumatic
  stress disorder; AVP: arginine vasopressin; ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone; CORT:
  corticosterone; ECS: endocannabinoid system; GR: glucocorticoid receptor.'
