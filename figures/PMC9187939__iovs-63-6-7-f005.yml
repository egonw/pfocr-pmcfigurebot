caption: Effect of BMP7 on the activation of signal proteins in response to proinflammatory
  cytokines treatment. Orbital fibroblasts from GO patients (n = 3) and normal control
  non-GO subjects (n = 3) were treated with IL-β or TNF-α (10 ng/mL for one hour)
  with or without pretreatment with 100 ng rhBMP7 for one hour. (A) Western blot analyses
  were conducted to compare protein expressions. Treatment with rhBMP7 attenuated
  IL-1β or TNF-α-induced expression of p-NFκB, p-Akt and p-Jnk in GO cells. Experiments
  were performed in three GO and three non-GO cells from different individuals. The
  representative gel images are shown. (B) Quantification of signal pathway proteins
  was performed using densitometry analysis. The relative band intensity of each protein
  was indicated by the ratio of phosphorylated protein and total protein and normalized
  to the level of β-actin in the same sample. The results are presented as the mean
  density ratio ± SD (*P < 0.05).
