caption: miR-140-3p is lowly expressed in plasma of asthmatic patients and ASMCs treated
  with PDGF-BB. A. The expression of miR-140-3p in plasma of asthmatic patients and
  healthy volunteers was detected by qRT-PCR. B. qRT-PCR was used to detect the relative
  expression of miR-140-3p after treating ASMCs with different concentrations (0,
  1, 10, 20, 40, 60 mg/ mL) of PDGF-BB for 24 hours. C. qRT-PCR was used to detect
  the relative expression of miR-140-3p after treating ASMCs with 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB
  for different time (, , , , 48 hours). D. ELISA was used to detect the levels of
  IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the supernatant of ASMCs after treatment with 20 ng/mL
  PDGF-BB for 24 hours. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n=3). *;
