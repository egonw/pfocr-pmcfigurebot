caption: In silico analysis of DLL1 and WNT10A, and their association with the progression
  of patients with CESC and with cervical cancer cell lines. (A) Putative miR-130a-3p
  binding site in the 3′untranslated regions of DLL1 and WNT10A, as predicted using
  TargetScan. (B,C) Expression boxplots of the genes using the GEPIA2 database (P<0.05;
  CESC tissues, n=306; normal tissues, n=13) (B) DLL1 expression; (C) WNT10A expression.
  (D) Association between DLL1 expression, and pathological stage in patients with
  CESC using the GEPIA2 database (P<0.05). (E) Association between WNT10A expression,
  and pathological stage in patients with CESC using the GEPIA2 database (P<0.05).
  (F) Data from the GENT2 database regarding DLL1 expression in a cervical cancer
  cell line panel in comparison with HaCaT cells. ns, not significant. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001. (G) Data from the GENT2 database regarding WNT10A expression
  in a cervical cancer cell line panel in comparison with HaCaT cells. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  (H,I) Spearman's pair-wise correlation analysis of miRNA-mRNA target pairs in cervical
  cancer cell lines paired in triplicate (n=5). (H) Correlation analysis revealed
  that increased miR-130a-p expression levels were associated with DLL1 downregulation
  in cervical cancer cell lines. In the correlation plots, the solid line represents
  the least square estimate, and P-values represent global significance P<0.05; (I)
  correlation analysis revealed that increased miR-130a-p expression levels were associated
  with WNT10A downregulation in cervical cancer cell lines. In the correlation plots,
  the solid line represents the least square estimate, and P-values represent global
  significance P<0.05. (J) Enrichment pathways using the DLL1 (right panel, red) and
  WNT10A (left panel, blue) genes in CESC. Significantly enriched pathways terms are
  shown in -log10 with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-corrected P-values.
  The letter in parentheses after each pathway gene set name corresponds to the source
  of the pathway annotations. B, BioCarta; K Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes;
  R, Reactome; P, Panther; CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical
  adenocarcinoma; miR, microRNA; GEPIA, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis;
  DLL1, δ-like Notch1 ligand.
