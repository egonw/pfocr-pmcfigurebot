caption: Al2O3 particles reduce the osteogenic activity through WNT/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) The Axin-2 reporter construct was transfected to MC3T3-E1 cells, and
  a luciferase assay was performed. The Axin-2 activity was reduced time-dependently
  in Al2O3 particles-treated cells. (B) Protein expression levels of pSer9-GSK-3β
  and stabilization of β-catenin were determined by Western blotting, and both decreased
  in Al2O3 particles-treated cells. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. Three independent
  experiments were performed to obtain similar results * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared
  to the control.
