caption: 'A Detection of the EGFR-ERK pathway and EMT inducers by western blotting
  in Hacat cells incubated with recombinant Sema3A and EGF for 48 h. B Protein levels
  of NRP1, EGFR, p-EGFR, ERK and p-ERK in cells transfected with si-NRP1. C Localization
  of NRP1 and EGFR proteins in Hacat cells. Scale bar = 20 µm. D Co-IP experiment
  between NRP1 and EGFR. IP: NRP1. WB: EGFR. E EGFR- and NRP1-overexpressing Hacat
  cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated time periods to inhibit
  de novo protein synthesis. As a control, MG132 was added to block the catalytic
  activity. F si-NRP1 and EGFR plasmids were cotransfected into NHEK cells for 48 h.
  Protein levels of NRP1, EGFR, p-EGFR, ERK and p-ERK were determined by western blot.
  G NHEK cells were transfected with si-NRP1 plasmids for 2 days before EGF (50 ng/ml)
  stimulation. Then the IF analysis of EGFR or NRP1 was showed. Scale bar = 20 µm.
  H NHEKs were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time.
  IFs were subsequently conducted in the resulting cells to monitor EGFR and NRP1
  localization/expression. Scale bar = 20 µm.'
