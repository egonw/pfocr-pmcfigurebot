caption: 'Effect of ADMSCs-derived exosomes on DOX/Trz-induced cardiac DNA damage
  and apoptosis: (A) Topoisomerase 2 beta (Top2b) and (B) p53 concentration by ELISA.
  Results are expressed as mean ± SEM; and (C) mRNA levels of cardiac Bax, Bcl-2,
  Bax/Bcl2 ratio, and PUMA. Data are expressed as median (maximum, minimum). *, significant
  compared to Group I at p ˂ 0.05; **, significant compared to Group I at p ˂ 0.01;
  ***, significant compared to Group I at p ˂ 0.001; #, significant compared to Group
  II at p ˂ 0.05; ##, significant compared to Group II at p ˂ 0.01; $, significant
