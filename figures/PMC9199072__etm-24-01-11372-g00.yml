caption: 'mRNA expression levels of PI3K and Akt in A431 cells following metformin
  treatment. The mRNA expression levels of PI3K and Akt in A431 cells treated with
  (A and C) 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 mM metformin for 24 h and (B and D) 45 mM metformin
  for 12, 24 and 36 h. The mRNA levels of PI3K and Akt were detected by reverse transcriptionpolymerase
  chain reaction. The relative optical density for mRNA was measured using Image J
  software, with GAPDH as an internal reference. All data, repeated by three independent
  experiments, are presented as mean Â± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and #P>0.05
  vs. control group.'
