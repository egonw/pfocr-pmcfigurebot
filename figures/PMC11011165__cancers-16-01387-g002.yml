caption: Strategies to inhibit STATs for cancer therapy. Several targets have been
  established to mediate anti-cancer effects within the STAT signaling pathway. These
  include inhibitors of upstream kinases, such as JAKs, SRC, and receptor tyrosine
  kinases; inhibitors of receptor chains like GP130 (such as atovaquone); activators
  of negative regulators, such as SOCS family members; degraders of STATs; and agents
  that interfere with recruitment of transcriptional complexes, such as pyrimethamine.
