caption: A schematic diagram showing metabolic stress-induced apoptosis in PC KO HT29
  cells exposed to CB-839 or 5-FU. X, inhibition or perturbation of pathway; (↓) down-regulation.
  ACC1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; dTMP, deoxythymidine
  monophosphate; dUMP, deoxyuridine monophosphate; FASN, fatty acid synthase; GDH,
  glutamate dehydrogenase; GLS1, glutaminase 1; IDH1, 2, 3, isocitrate dehydrogenase
  1, 2, 3; OAA, oxaloacetate; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; p53, tumor protein 53; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; TS, thymidylate synthase.
article_title: CRISPR Cas9-mediated ablation of pyruvate carboxylase gene in colon
  cancer cell line HT-29 inhibits growth and migration, induces apoptosis and increases
  sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and glutaminase inhibitor.
