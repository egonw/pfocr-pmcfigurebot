caption: CPNE8 promoted GC cell migration and invasion in vitro. (A) Wound-healing
  assays revealed that stably suppressed CPNE8 expression inhibited migration of GC
  cells in vitro, whereas elevated CPNE8 expression had the opposite effects. (B)
  Quantitative analysis of wound closure. (C) Transwell assays showed that knockdown
  of CPNE8 reduced the migration and invasion of GC cells while overexpression of
  CPNE8 enhanced the migration and invasion ability of the GC cells. (D) Quantitative
  analysis of migration and invasion of GC cells. Data are presented as mean values
  Â± SD of three independent experiments.
