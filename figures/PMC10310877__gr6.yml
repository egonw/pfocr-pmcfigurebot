caption: 'Effects of brusatol, k252a, and U0126 on MCG-mediated pharmacological activity
  against novel object recognition (A) and passive avoidance tests (B) in aged GPx-1
  KO mice. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M. of 8 animals. ∗P < 0.05 vs. Saline

  followed by Fisher''s LSD pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the data.'
