caption: 'Overexpression of UBE2L3 promotes tumor cell metastasis. A. Immunoblotting
  analyses were performed to determine the expression of UBE2L3 in LUAD cells. B.
  Representative images of wound healing assays and the percentage of wound closure.
  Magnification: 40× (scar bar =200 μm). C. The effect of UBE2L3 overexpression on
  the migration and invasion of LUAD cells was assessed using Transwell assays. Magnification:
  100× (scar bar =100 μm). D, E. Representative HE staining of lung metastasis after
  the injection of cancer cells into BALB/c mice via tail vein. Magnification: 100×
  (scar bar =100 μm). The quantification of lung metastasis (n=5 mice per group).
  ***P<0.001; **P<0.001.'
