caption: 'Expression of CD155 affects the proliferation and migration of EC. A, B
  CD155 expression in stably transfected cells. A RT–PCR was used to analyze mRNA
  levels. B Western blot revealed CD155 protein levels. C Cell viability was analyzed
  using the CCK8 assay. D Migration rates were measured using the wound-scratch assay
  method. Left: Image of one wound-scratch assay. Right: Quantitative analysis of
  the wound-scratch assays performed. E Image of xenografted nude mouse model and
  respective xenografted tumor. F Tumor volume curves of xenograft tumors overexpressing
  CD155 and NC (n = 5 for each condition). G, H analysis of xenograft tumors on the
  day of tumor removal. The volume (G) and weight (H) of each tumor was measured.
  I, J Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of CD155 protein expression in the tumor
  tissues of nude mice. I Images of the tissues. J quantitative analysis of the images
  was performed using Image Pro Plus, and statistical analysis was performed using
  GraphPad Prism 8.0. K, L CD155 was knocked down and overexpressed in GFP-tagged
  Eca109 cells. The cells were injected intravenously into nude mice (n = 3). Two
  months later, the mice and the lungs and liver of the mice underwent bioluminescence
  imaging. K HE staining of leg metastasis (100 X magnification). L Representative
  images of HE staining of the lung and liver metastases (100 X magnification). Scale
  bar, 100 μm. (M) Showing the statistical analysis for the counts of metastases imaged
  in vivo in nude mice in Fig. 3K. *, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001'
