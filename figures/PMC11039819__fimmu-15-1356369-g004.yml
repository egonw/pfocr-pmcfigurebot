caption: STING signaling is linked to autophagy. STING directly induces the formation
  of autophagosomes at the ERGIC in a WIPI2-dependent manner utilizing the ERGIC as
  a membrane source. This process is independent of “canonical” upstream autophagic
  machinery such as ULK1 or VPS34. However, STING itself is not degraded this way
  but rather by microautophagy where it is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles
  from the Golgi by AP-1. These vesicles are directly taken up by lysosomes thereby
  terminating STING signaling. Alternatively, upon activation by cGAMP, STING can
  be transported to neighbouring cells inside non-canonical RAB22A-dependent autophagosomes
  that fuse with endosomes. The emerging new vesicle can inactivate Rab7, thereby
  escaping lysosomal degradation and allowing STING pathway activation in surrounding
  tissues.
