caption: Combination of docetaxel and androgen-deprived treatment activates the cGAS/STING
  pathway in prostate cancer cells. A. QRT-PCR analysis of genomic DNA (RPL13 and
  RNA18S) and mitochondrial DNA (MT-ND1 and MT-ND2) in LNCaP cells (left panel) and
  PC3 cells (right panel) after treatment with DMSO, bicalutamide (BLM), docetaxel
  (DTX), or bicalutamide plus docetaxel (BLM+DTX) for the indicated time. B. Western
  blot analysis of cGAS/STING pathways components with indicated antibodies in LNCaP
  cells (left panel) and PC3 cells (right panel) after treatment with DMSO, bicalutamide
  (BLM), docetaxel (DTX), or bicalutamide plus docetaxel (BLM+DTX) for the indicated
  time. C. Representative flow plots and quantification of the positive percentage
  of p-STING and p-IRF3 expression in LNCaP cells (upper panel) and PC3 cells (lower
  panel) after DMSO, bicalutamide (BLM), docetaxel (DTX), or bicalutamide plus docetaxel
  (BLM+DTX) treatment for 24 hours. D. QRT-PCR analysis of cGAS/STING pathway downstream
  immune genes in LNCaP cells (left panel) and PC3 cells (right panel) after treatment
  with DMSO, bicalutamide (BLM), docetaxel (DTX), or bicalutamide plus docetaxel (BLM+DTX)
  for the indicated time. Each point represents an independent experiment. Data were
  presented as mean values Â± SEM. Unpaired data were analyzed using the t-test or
  Wilcox rank sum test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.
