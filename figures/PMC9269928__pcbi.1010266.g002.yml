figure_title: 'The SMAD-signaling model: From population averages to stochastic single
  cells'
caption: 'A: Topology of the TGF-β pathway model. Extracellular TGF-β (yellow) binds
  to free TGF-β receptors on the cell membrane (blue ovals) to form a receptor-ligand
  complex (gray ovals). This complex is then internalized into the endosome (R1R2Le)
  and there functions as an enzyme that phosphorylates SMAD2 (blue rectangle). Phosphorylated
  SMAD forms homo- and heterotrimers, which are transported into the nucleus. Nuclear
  SMAD further induces the expression of a generic feedback regulator (light green)
  inhibiting TGF-β receptors. Extensions in the scheme indicate endosomal (e), nuclear
  (n) and phosphorylated (p) species. State transitions and intercompartmental shuttling
  are indicated with arrows, enzyme catalysis with circle headed bars, and feedback
  inhibition with blunt headed bars. Colored circles mark parts of the pathway where
  stochastic noise was introduced in the ‘degradation’, ‘receptor-ligand’ and ‘internalization’
  model variants. This panel was modified from []. B: CIR model dynamics for kinetic
  parameters. Temporal noise in kinetic parameters of the model is shown. For combinations
  of the variance and reversion parameters σ and θ in the CIR model () chosen according
  to the graph in the bottom right, multiple trajectories are shown, along with their
  temporal distributions, which resemble log-normal distributions. In the top left,
  the noise parameter σ was low, whereas it was high otherwise, either with a high
  (bottom left) or low (top right) reversion parameter θ. C: Flowchart of the modeling
  approach. Starting from the deterministic model, which was fitted to the population
  mean, processes within the signaling pathway (colored reaction steps in panel A)
  were chosen that are sensitive to temporally stochastic occurrences in the cells.
  Then, random noise (panel B) was introduced in the kinetic parameters connected
  to the respective critical process (block model). This enabled the reproduction
  of and model fitting to single cell behavior. D: Propagation of stochastic noise
  in the model. Noise was introduced in the receptor internalization rates as done
  in the stochastic internalization model, see . The noise controlling parameters
  of the CIR model were chosen as indicated by the same colors in panel B. Simulated
  trajectories of the dynamic model concentrations accounting for the activated complex
  on the cell surface (y7, left), the activated endosomal complex (y8, center) and
  the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio (right) are depicted. For details on model species see .
  The trajectories show how the temporal noise propagates through the pathway for
  different parameters in the CIR model.'
