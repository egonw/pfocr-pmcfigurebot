caption: Knockdown of BCL11A inhibited cell proliferation in SK-N-BE(2) and IMR-32.
  (A, B) Cell growth of controlled and si-BCL11A cells was determined by CCK-8 assay.
  Data represent the mean Â± SD, n=5. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. control.
  (C, D) Cell proliferation of controlled and si-BCL11A cells was examined by colony
  formation assay. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 vs. control. (E, F) Cell cycle analysis
  was determined by flow cytometry in controlled and si-BCL11A cells. *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. control. All experiments were repeated at least three times.
