caption: 'GO Analysis of starch and sucrose metabolism (main routes related to trehalose
  metabolism) in quinoa leaves. (A) Overview of the starch and sucrose metabolism
  pathway in quinoa leaves in response to saline-alkali stress. Rectangles with orange
  frames, metabolites; circles, DEGs; blue solid lines with arrows, directions of
  the processes; rectangles with green frames, other metabolism pathways; gray dotted
  lines, connection of the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway with other metabolism
  pathways. The colors of rectangles and circles indicate significances, which are
  presented in color scales. The genes highlighted in red were detected by RT-qPCR.
  (B) RT-qPCR analysis of the DEGs. UBQ9 (AUR62020068) was used as endogenoue control.
  Three independent experiments per sample, three replicates per experiment. *, p
  < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; Student’s t-test. Abbreviations: AMY, α-amylase;
  GBE1, glycogen branching enzyme; glgA, glycogen synthase; glgC, ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase;
  ISA, isoamylase; malZ, maltodextrin glucosidase; SUS, sucrose synthase; T6P, trehalose
  6-phosphate; TPP, trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase; TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate
  synthase; UDP-glucose, uridine diphosphate glucose.'
