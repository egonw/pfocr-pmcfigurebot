caption: 'Muscone suppresses oxidation-stress-mediated inflammation via blocking Ca2+/Erk1/2
  signaling pathway. (A) The inhibition matrix of ROS production in LPS-induced bEnd.3
  cells treated with muscone (dose range from 0 to 2 μM) and (+)-borneol (dose range
  from 0 to 40 μM) for 16 h; (B) column chart of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of IL-1β-related genes pulled from the human interactome; (C) p-NF-κB p65, NF-κB
  p65, TLR4, NLRP3, p-Erk1/2, Erk 1/2, p-p38 MAPK, p38-MAPK, p-SAPK/JNK, JNK1/2/3,
  and HIF-1α protein expression were determined in LPS-induced bEnd.3 cells (n = 5);
  (D) relative fluorescent density of intracellular Ca2+ indicated by Fluo 8-AM staining
  was measured by multimode microplate reader (n = 5); (E) calcineurin (CaN) activity
  and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) activity were measured
  in LPS-stimulated bEnd.3 cells (n = 5); (F) IL-1β level in bEnd.3 cells when exposed
  to LPS stimulation (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5). * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS treatment; ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. indicated
  treatment; ns: no significant difference. p values are determined by one-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s test.'
