caption: The differentially expressed genes of NP-degenerative and NP-normal, embedded
  on UAMP dimension reduction map, and colored by gene expression levels. (A) UAMP
  Plot showing PTGES, ANGPTL4 and IGFBP3 are mainly highly enriched in chondrocyte
  4 of NP-degenerative. (B) UAMP Plot showing GDF15, TRIB3 and TNFRSF10B are mainly
  highly enriched in chondrocyte 5 of NP-degenerative
