caption: 'Schematic representation of the downstream signalling pathways of neurofibromin.
  Neurofibromin inhibits the activity of Ras by its guanosine triphosphatase activity.
  Loss of activity of neurofibromin in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) leads to the
  activation of different pathways mediated by RAS, namely the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase cascade leading to activation of ERK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway. These pathways activate nuclear transcription factors and are responsible
  for endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation, increased survival and migration.
  PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in brain; TSC: tuberous
  sclerosis protein.'
