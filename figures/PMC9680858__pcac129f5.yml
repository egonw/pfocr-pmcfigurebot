caption: Functional network of the oil body genes and related enzyme genes. (A) The
  biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids. Different colors indicate the subcellular location
  of each pathway. Asterisks indicate genes represented in the functional network
  (B). ACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; CMK, CDP-ME kinase; CPT, cis-prenyltransferase;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; FTPSL,
  fungal-type terpene synthase-like; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; HDR, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate reductase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase;
  HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; IDS, isoprenyl diphosphate synthases;
  IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; MCT, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase;
  MDS, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; MVD, mevalonate diphosphate
  decarboxylase; MK, mevalonate kinase; MTPSL, microbial-type synthase-like; PMK,
  phosphomevalonate kinase. (B) The functional network of the four marker genes for
  oil bodies (dark green) and their functionally and transcriptionally associated
  genes (light green). The shape of each gene represents the KOG annotation, as explained
  on the MBEX website. (C) The UpSet plot of co-expressed genes with the four marker
  genes. (D) Word cloud of the GO enrichment result of genes, shown in arbitrary colors,
  that were co-expressed with at least three of the four marker genes. The size of
  each word indicates the degree of enrichment. (E) Bar plot of Pfam enrichment genes
  co-expressed with at least three of the four marker genes.
