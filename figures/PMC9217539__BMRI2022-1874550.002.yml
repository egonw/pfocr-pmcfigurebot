caption: 'Rab22a promotes malignant biological behaviors in thyroid cancer cells.
  The level of Rab22a was increased or decreased after transfection with different
  plasmids or specific interference plasmids of Rab22a, respectively (a). Rab22a promoted
  the proliferation of TPC1 and K1 cells, as shown by colony formation and CCK8 assays
  (b and c). Statistical data were the mean ± SD of the three repeated independent
  trials: ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.'
