caption: Gametogenesis is induced by transferring plus or minus vegetatively growing
  cells, which are haploid, into medium lacking a nitrogen source (N-free medium).
  Within seconds after mixing plus and minus gametes, random collisions between the
  highly motile cells lead to their tethering by their cilia through binding between
  the ciliary adhesion receptor SAG1 on plus gametes and SAD1 on minus gametes. In
  addition to tethering the cilia, SAG1-SAD1 binding also induces nearly 20-fold increases
  in cellular concentrations of the second messenger cAMP. The increase in cAMP brings
  about multiple cellular responses that prepare the gametes for fusion. Gametes release
  their cell wall, a non-cellulose-containing extracellular matrix composed of hydroxyproline-rich
  glycoproteins [,]; they recruit and activate a store of inactive ciliary adhesion
  molecules [] from the cell plasma membrane to the ciliary membrane [,]; and they
  erect mating type-specific membrane protuberances (the plus and minus mating structures)
  between their two cilia that will be the sites of cell-cell fusion and that bear
  a second set of gamete-specific membrane receptors, the adhesion protein FUS1 on
  plus gametes and it binding partner MAR1 on minus gametes.Of particular importance,
  the minus mating structure also harbors the conserved fusion protein HAP2. FUS1-MAR1
  engagement at the tips of the two mating structures triggers a fusogenic reconfiguration
  of the latent, prefusion form of HAP2 into homotrimers. The complete cell coalescence
  that follows bilayer merger generates yetother signals, including blocks to polygamy
  in which FUS1, HAP2, and MAR1 aredegraded [,]; initiation of the zygote developmental
  pathway through the action the newly formed GSP1-GSM1 heterodimer; and nuclear fusion
  through the action of the nuclear envelope protein, GEX1. After an obligate time
  in the dark, incubation in culture medium in the light directly induces germination
  and meiosis, with no intervening mitoses, to produce the 4 haploid products of meiosis,
  two plus and two minus vegetative cells. FUS1/GEX2, HAP2, and KAR5/GEX1 are in dark
  green font to indicate that members of this triad are used from algae through higher
  land plants. The GSP1-GSM1 heterodimer is in lighter green to indicate its use in
  algae through early diverging land plants.
