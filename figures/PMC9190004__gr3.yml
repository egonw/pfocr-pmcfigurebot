caption: 'KLF15 orchestrates PPARδ binding in skeletal muscle.A, Venn diagram demonstrating
  the overlap of PPARδ sites from PPARδ ChIP-seq in MyoCre vs K15-SKO. B, Heatmap
  of PPARδ ChIP-seq centered around all PPARδ peaks, showing loss of PPARδ binding
  in K15-SKO at the same locations. Top right: average profile of PPARδ binding centered
  around peak centers in MyoCre and K15-SKO. Bottom right: comparison of log-transformed
  enrichment scores for top 5% of PPARδ peaks showing increased binding in MyoCre.
  C, distribution of PPARδ binding relative to TSSs in the presence and absence of
  KLF15. D, distribution of genomic locations at which PPARδ is bound in MyoCre vs
  K15-SKO. E, pathway analysis of genes associated with decreased PPARδ binding in
  K15-SKO PPARδ ChIP-seq demonstrating enrichment for lipid metabolism pathways. F,
  representative tracks demonstrating decreased PPARδ binding at metabolic genes when
  KLF15 is absent. KLF15, Krüppel-like factor 15; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor; TSS, transcription start site.'
