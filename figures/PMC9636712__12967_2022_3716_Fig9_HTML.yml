caption: Elevated ACE2 expression is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients
  receiving chemotherapy. A Waffle Chart of clinicopathological characteristics of
  breast cancer patients with high and low ACE2 expression. B Kaplan–Meier curves
  of the RFS and DMFS in BRCA patients receiving chemotherapy with high or low ACE2
  expression (KM Plotter database). C Kaplan–Meier curves of the RFS and DMFS in ACE2
  high and low expression groups in BRCA patients who did not receive chemotherapy
  (KM Plotter database). D Kaplan–Meier curves of the RFS and DMFS of systematically
  untreated BRCA with high or low ACE2 expression (KM Plotter database). E Kaplan–Meier
  survival analysis of OS in ACE2 high and low expression groups in the METABRIC cohort
  of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and F breast cancer patients not
  receiving chemotherapy
