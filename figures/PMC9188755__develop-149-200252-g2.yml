caption: 'Double in situ hybridization for Nodal with Hex, Netrin, Chordin, ADMP or
  Lhx2/9a. Double fluorescent in situ hybridization of Nodal and the endoderm marker
  Hex (A-H) and of Nodal and the dorsal axial markers Netrin (I-P), Chordin (Q-X),
  ADMP (Y-F′) and Lhx2/9a (G′-N′) in control and SU5402-treated embryos fixed at 15 hpf
  (G6) and 18 hpf (N1). No overlap is observed. Dorsal views and transverse views
  are shown for in situ hybridization data, with anterior towards the top and dorsal
  towards the top, respectively. Nuclei DAPI staining is in blue. The white arrowheads
  indicate the neural plate labelling observed for Netrin, Chordin and ADMP. At least
  five embryos per stage were analysed and they all showed the same pattern. Scale
  bar: 25 µm.'
