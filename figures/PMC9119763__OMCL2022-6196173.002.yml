caption: 'Administration of Fn1 inhibitor alleviated I/R-induced cardiac dysfunction.
  (a) Fn1 inhibitor RGDS structure. (b) Schematic representation of the experimental
  protocol. Male wild-type mice (n = 8 per group) were treated with Fn1 inhibitor
  RGDS and then subjected to myocardial I/R for 24 or 72 hours. (c) Echocardiographic
  images of the left ventricle (top). (d) Quantification of EF%, FS%, LVIDs, and LVIDd
  (bottom, n = 8 per group). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001 versus the sham-operated group; ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.0001
  versus I/R 24 h; &&P < 0.01; &&&P < 0.001, &&&&P < 0.0001 versus I/R 72 h.'
