caption: 'a Hematoxylin and eosin staining of intracranial tumor plantation showed
  the tumor size in the coronal location of eight groups. Scale bar = 10 mm. b The
  tumor volumes measured among eight groups are indicated. (nc vs. kd: p < 0.001;
  ev vs. oe: p = 0.0015; Student’s t-test). c Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed
  that circRPPH1-KD prolonged the survival of mice while circRPPH1-OE shortened the
  survival. (For each group, n = 5, nc vs. kd: p = 0.0415; ev vs. oe: p = 0.0180;
  Log-rank test). d Immunohistochemical staining showed that the protein expression
  was decreased by circRPPH1-KD and increased by circRPPH1-OE. Scale bar = 20 μm.
  e The German scoring of the protein expression in each group. (Ki67: p < 0.01; UPF1:
  p < 0.01; ATF3: p < 0.01; TGF-β1: p < 0.01 Student’s t-test). f Schematic diagram
  displayed the whole UPF1/circRPPH1/ATF3 feedback loop, which promoted the malignant
  phenotype of glioma and stemness of GSCs through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. All
  results are obtained as the mean ± SD under at least biological triplicate assays.
