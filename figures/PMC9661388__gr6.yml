caption: Unique “Metabolism” reactome pathway members in the d 14 and d 42 (A and
  B) liver and (C and D) breast muscle of Ross 308 broilers fed corn-based diets with
  0.175% algae. Proteins that were unique to each timepoint and tissue within the
  “Metabolism” reactome pathway were input into STRING to generate protein-protein
  interaction groups. Red proteins represent members of the “Metabolism of Lipids”
  pathway while purple proteins represent members of the “Fatty acid metabolism” pathway
  in the liver at both (A) d14 and (B) d 42. In panel C, red proteins represent members
  of the “Pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle” pathway in the breast muscle at d 14.
  In Panel D, red proteins represent members of the “metabolism of carbohydrates”
  in the breast muscle at d 42.

  health, and immunological responses to a microalgae-based feed ingredient in broiler
  chickens.
