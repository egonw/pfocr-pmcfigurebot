caption: 'Regulation of cell proliferation, migration, TGF‐β/Smad signaling and EMT‐related
  gene expression in HGC27 cells by PAQR3. (A) The expression abundance of PAQR3 mRNA
  in SGC7901 cells with PAQR3 overexpressing, HGC27 cells with PAQR3 overexpressing,
  and their controls was determined by quantitative RT‐PCR, respectively. Data were
  presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). ***p < 0.001. (B) The rates of
  cells growth was determined by MTT analytical method at indicated time point using
  HGC27 cells overexpressing PAQR3 (PAQR3 OV) and HGC27 cells with an empty vector
  (Ctrl). Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). ***p < 0.001.
  (C) Colony formation experiments were performed as follows: HGC27 cells in the log‐growth
  phase were seeded in six wells, with 400 cells per well, and clones were counted
  after 5 days of culture. (D) Statistical analysis results was shown. Data were presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). ***P < 0.001. (E) Transwell experiments were
  performed as follow: HGC27 cells in the log‐growth phase were seeded in a 24‐well
  transwell chamber, and cells in the lower chamber were fixed after 24 h of culture,
  then cells were counterstained with crystal violet. (F) The results of the statistical
  analysis were shown. Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
  ***p < 0.001. (G) The scratch wound healing experiment was carried out as follows:
  HGC27 cells were transfected overexpressing PAQR3 plasmid or with a control plasmid,
  and then photographed at 0 and 24 h after scratch to analyze the effects of PAQR3
  overexpression on cell migration. (H) The results of the statistical analysis were
  shown. Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). ***p < 0.001.
  (I and J) HGC27 cells were transfected with a control plasmid or overexpressed PAQR3
  plasmid, and after 3 days of culture, the effects of PAQR3 on the expression of
  EMT‐related genes and the expression TGF‐β/Smad signaling key protein were detected
  by immunoblotting with antibodies. I:first WB results, J: second WB results for
  the same sample.'
