caption: High expression and significant association of HOXC6 in GBM. The mRNA levels
  of HOXC6 were analyzed using the ONCOMINE gene profile database. In the images,
  the best gene rank percentile was used to define the color of the cells. The thresholds
  were gene rank = top 10%, fold change = 1.5, and p value = 1E − 4. (b) In the heat
  map of HOXC6 from the TCGA datasets, the topmost bar represents the sample type,
  in which blue represents normal control samples, and red represents tumor samples;
  the color gradation at the upper right represents gene expression, in which the
  color changes from red to green from the top to the bottom, indicating gene expression
  changes from high to low; the abscissa represents sample number, and the ordinate
  represents gene names; each rectangle corresponds to a sample expression value.
  The dendrogram on the left represents cluster analysis based on differences in gene
  expression. (c) HOXC6 was highly expressed in high- and low-grade gliomas in the
  GEPIA database. (d) HOXC6 expression data in the CGGA databases with high and low
  expressions of HOXC6. (e) The prognostic survival rates of GBM patients with low
  and high HOXC6 expressions were analyzed using the GEPIA database. (f) The prognostic
  survival rates of LGG GBM patients with low and high HOXC6 expression were analyzed
  using the GEPIA database. The prognostic survival rate of glioma patients with high
  HOXC6 expression was low, while the risk ratio was significantly higher (HR = 3.5;
  p = 4.3E − 8). (g) Using the CGGA database, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for
  patients with high and low HOXC6 expressions. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p <
  0.001. Data are shown as the mean ± SD.
