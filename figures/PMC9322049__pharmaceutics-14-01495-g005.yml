caption: Dual one-shot anti-inflammatory therapy. (A) Scheme of the inflammatory response
  activation pathway by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O111:B4 and
  nigericin (NG) exposure and the double-hit strategy design by using CRISPR-MSNs.
  (B) Western blot analysis of the GSDMD levels expressed in the cell lysates of the
  CRISPR-MSNs editing studies. Representative images of at least three independent
  experiments. (C) LDH release assay and (D) IL-1β levels. Data represent the mean
  ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined
  by applying a one-way ANOVA analysis with multiple comparisons (*** p < 0.001).
  No significant differences were denoted as ns.
