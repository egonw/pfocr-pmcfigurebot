caption: 'AFAP1L1 facilitates EMT of GC cells. A Pearson correlation analysis of AFAP1L1
  and EMT markers (epithelial marker: E-cadherin, EPCAM; mesenchymal markers: vimentin,
  N-cadherin) in GC using data from TCGA STAD database. B qRT-PCR analysis of AFAP1L1
  and EMT markers in AGSshAFAP1L1, MKN74AFAP1L1 and their control cells. C Western
  blot analysis of AFAP1L1 and EMT markers in AGSshAFAP1L1, MKN74AFAP1L1 and their
  control cells. D Double immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin (red) and vimentin
  (green) in AGSshAFAP1L1, MKN74AFAP1L1 and their control cells. Nuclei was stained
  with DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 10 μm. E The representative IHC images from serial
  sections of GC samples showed AFAP1L1, E-cadherin and vimentin expression in ANGT
  and GC tissues with high or low AFAP1L1 expression. ***P < 0.001'
