caption: DSF activated antitumor immune response via the cGAS-STING pathway. A. The
  protein levels of γH2AX in PANC-1 cells treated by chemotherapy and/or DSF (10 μM)
  were detected by western blot. B. Quantification of the staining results of cytosolic
  dsDNA in PANC-1 cells. C. S172 phosphorylation of TBK1 in PANC-1 cells treated by
  chemotherapy and/or DSF (10 μM). D. cGAS protein expression was detected by western
  blot in PANC-1 cells transfected with shNC or shRNA targeting cGAS. E and F. The
  mRNA level of IFNα and IFNβ in PANC-1 cells transfected with shNC or shcGAS after
  being treated with DSF plus chemotherapy or STING agonist (diABZI) was determined
  by qRT-PCR. G. S172 phosphorylation of TBK1 and total TBK1 protein levels were detected
  in PANC-1 cells with or without chemotherapy plus DSF treatment (**P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, NS indicates no significance).
