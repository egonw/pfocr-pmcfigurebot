caption: (A) GSEA showing that the pathways of mitochondrial gene expression, organization
  and metabolism include genes mostly down-regulated in cells treated with the combination
  of AA7.1 and SP-2577 compared to vehicle cells. (B) Cytoscape representation of
  the network of down-regulated biological functions when the combination of AA7.1
  and SP-2577 is used. (C) Schematic representation of our model. The overexpression
  of LSD1 in Gr3 MB positively modulates PRUNE-1 expression via binding to its promoter
  region leading to activation of TGF-β pathway, through SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation and PTEN inhibition. AA7.1 is responsible for the proteasomal-dependent
  degradation of Prune-1 protein []. When LSD1/KDM1A inhibitor SP-2577 is used in
  combination with PRUNE-1 inhibitor AA7.1, LSD1 is not able to enhance PRUNE-1 transcription.
  Then the activation of TGF-β pathway is lower and PTEN is up-regulated. This determines
  a deregulation of genes involved in neuronal commitment, antigen presenting cells,
  a cytotoxic mediated T cell response and a significant impairment of mitochondrial
  metabolism and OXPHOS. Created with Biorender.
