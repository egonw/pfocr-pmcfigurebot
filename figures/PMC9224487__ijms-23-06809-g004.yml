caption: Changes in the myocardial levels of (A) glycolysis intermediates, (B) hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway intermediates, (C) acylcarnitines, and (D) tricarboxylic acid
  cycle intermediates in volume-overloaded rats in the compensated hypertrophic (CH)
  and heart failure (HF) phases and in volume-overloaded rats with correction of volume
  overload in the CH (CHCOV) and HF phases (HFCOV) compared to those in the corresponding
  sham controls. In each z-score plot, the data are shown as standard deviation from
  the mean of sham. Each dot represents a single metabolite in each sample. The vertical
  lines represent the means of z-scores. n = 6 per group. Blue, red, and green stars
  denote comparison between CH or HF vs. sham, CHCOV or HFCOV vs. sham, and CH vs.
  HF, respectively. *, **, and *** denote p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.
