caption: O-GlcNAcylation attenuated insulin signaling. Normal insulin signaling (Left).
  Insulin binding to the insulin receptor (IR) leads to the recruitment of IRS-1 and
  activates PI3K, producing PIP3 and activating PDK1 and AKT. The PI3K/AKT pathway
  induces the expression of GLUT4 and its transport from intracellular vesicles to
  cell membranes to promote glucose uptake. In addition, the PI3K/AKT pathway activates
  GSK3β and GS to promote glycogen synthesis. Insulin signaling was inhibited by O-GlcNAcylation
  (Right). OGT inactivated key insulin signaling proteins, including IRS-1, PI3K,
  PDK1, AKT, and PTP1B, and attenuated insulin signaling and insulin resistance. PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1;
  AKT, serine/threonine-protein kinase B; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta;
  GS, glycogen synthase; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase.
