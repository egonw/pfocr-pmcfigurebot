caption: Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals the role of flavonoid pathway under
  OPDA treatment. (A) Proposed biosynthetic pathway of flavonoid synthesis in Pohlia
  nutans with heatmap showing gene expression levels. The color box of each gene indicates
  the log2(fold change) obtained from transcriptome sequencing analysis. CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  FNS, flavone synthase; 2-OGD, 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase; F3′5′H,
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. (B) qPCR analysis confirmed
  that several genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were markedly upregulated
  under OPDA treatment. Significant difference (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns, no significant).
