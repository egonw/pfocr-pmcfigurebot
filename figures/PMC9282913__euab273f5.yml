caption: Exercise-similar atrial pacing cardioprotective transcriptional response.
  (A) RNAseq profile of ventricles from sham vs. atrial-paced mice showing significant
  differentially expressed (DE) upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes (Log2
  fold change > 1.5; FDR < 0.05). (B and C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of DE genes
  >1.5-fold for candidate upstream Master Regulators (B) and for enriched Diseases
  and Functions annotation categories (C). An activation Z-score threshold of Â±2 is
  used to identify likely hits. FPKM, fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads.
article_title: Atrial-paced, exercise-similar heart rate envelope induces myocardial
  protection from ischaemic injury.
