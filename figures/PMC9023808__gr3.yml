caption: The role of the canonical β-catenin signaling pathway in the effects of exogenous
  WNT16B on LECs(A and B) WB showed that the protein level of TNKS and β-catenin in
  LECs was unchanged with the treatment of exogenous WNT16B but was significantly
  inhibited by the treatment of either 10 μmol/L XAV939 (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008)
  or WNT16B + XAV939 (both p = 0.006). However, no significant differences were found
  between these two interventions.(C–E) Quantification of the outgrowth area (C and
  D) and cell numbers € on the 11th day showed that the growth of WNT16B + XAV939
  co-treated LECs was much faster than those of the control and XAV939-treated LECs
  (both p < 0.001) but was similar to those of WNT16B-treated LECs.(F and G) IF staining
  (F) and quantification of cells expressing active β-catenin, KI67, ▵NP63α, and ABCG2
  (G) showed that although active nuclear β-catenin was significantly inhibited in
  LECs co-treated with XAV939 + WNT16B (p = 0.010), expression of KI67, ▵NP63α, and
  ABCG2 did not significantly differ between these cells and LECs treated with WNT16B
  only.(H) Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression profiles of
  KI67, ▵NP63α, and ABCG2 were almost the same in LECs co-treated with XAV939 + WNT16B
  and LECs treated with WNT16B only.(I and J) The clonogenic capacity of WNT16B +
  XAV939 co-treated LECs was significantly stronger than that of control and XAV939-treated
  LECs (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002) but was similar to that of WNT16B-treated LECs. Data
  are from three independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
