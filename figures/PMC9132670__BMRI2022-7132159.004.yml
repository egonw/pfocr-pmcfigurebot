caption: BRU downregulates RhoA/ROCK1 pathway protein expressions in colorectal cancer
  cells. After the respective treatment concentrations were added into HCT-116 and
  SW480 cells, the expressions of RhoA and ROCK1 in the treated and the untreated
  groups were detected by western blot (a, b), and the results of quantitative analysis
  by the Image Lab software (c, d). Representative immunofluorescence images of HCT-116
  cells treated with or without 6 nM BRU for 24 h (e, f). The mRNA expressions of
  RhoA and ROCK1 in HCT-116 cells were determined by RT-QPCR (g). All data were shown
  as mean ± SD from three independent trials (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control).
