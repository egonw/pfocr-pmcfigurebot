figure_title: AS-IV regulates neuroinflammation and ferroptosis by modulating the
  Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway after MCAO. Nrf2 and HO-1 in the rat brain cortex after
  MCAO were evaluated by reverse transcription-qPCR. MCAO markedly enhanced Nrf2 (a)
  and HO-1 (b) mRNA expression, while this trend was reversed after AS-IV treatment.
  (c) Western blotting was utilized to determine the protein expression levels of
  Nrf2 and HO-1 in the rat cerebral cortex after MCAO. AS-IV markedly increased the
  protein expression levels of (d) Nrf2 and (e) HO-1 after MCAO. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD
