caption: 'LKB1 negatively regulates glucagon‐induced genes, but not Wnt‐regulated
  genes. (A) Upstream regulators of LKB1 identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). (B) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in LKB1 KO (current study)
  and glucagon KO[] showing 119 overlapping genes. (C) The correlation between LKB1
  KO and glucagon KO genes. (D) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in
  LKB1 KO (current study) and Wnt‐regulated,[ ,  ] showing 191 overlapping genes.
  (E) The correlation between LKB1 KO and Wnt‐regulated genes. (F) Heat map of representative
  differentially expressed genes in LKB1 KO, glucagon (Gcg) KO[] and Gcg receptor
  (Gcgr) KO.[] (G) Fold change of transcription factors in WT versus LKB1 KO mice.
