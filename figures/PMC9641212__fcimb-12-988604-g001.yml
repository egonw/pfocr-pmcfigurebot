caption: Cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection (). SARS-CoV-2 enters the host
  through the respiratory tract. After entering the cells, they will replicate and
  invade the adjacent cells and extracellular space, of which respiratory symptoms
  are the most common. After the innate immune system is activated, innate immune
  cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells react and release
  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN- γ to control infection. When the
  release of proinflammatory cytokines is unbalanced, it will cause inflammatory cell
  death characterized by pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). It is
  characterized by a sharp increase in cytokines and a positive feedback loop in the
  pathway of programmed cell death related to inflammation, which we call cytokine
  storm, which can eventually develop into multiple organ dysfunction. Under the joint
  action of TNF and IFN- γ, it can activate JAK-STAT1-IRF1 axis, induce nitric oxide
  production and drive caspase8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis.
