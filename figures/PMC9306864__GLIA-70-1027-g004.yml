caption: The actin nucleation promoting factor wasla is less expressed in microglia
  from HRasV12+ larvae. (a) Heatmap of differentially expressed (DE) genes (FDR < 0.05,
  Fold Change > |2|) from microglia transcriptome comparisons between 5 dpf HRasV12−
  and HRasV12+ larval brains (11 genes), belonging to zebrafish actin cytoskeleton
  KEGG pathways [Regulation of actin cytoskeleton, Focal adhesion, Adherens junction,
  Tight junction and mTOR signaling pathway]. The actin nucleation promoting factor
  wasla is the top ranked gene of the list. See also Table . (b) Dot plots of normalized
  transformed read counts of the representative WASP family genes. Black plots represent
  non‐DE genes whereas, red plots correspond to DE genes at 5 dpf between control
  and HRasV12+ conditions. (b) The means ± SD of three independent experiments are
  plotted. (c) Dot plots of normalized transformed read counts of WASL gene expression
  of monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDMs) and microglia in human non tumor and glioma
  IDH WT brain samples (Klemm et al., )
