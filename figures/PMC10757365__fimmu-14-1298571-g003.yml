caption: PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint. The action mechanism begins when T cells are activated
  upon recognition of the antigen presented in HLA-I, triggering a signaling cascade
  and the release of cytokines that activate their proliferation. (A) In a normal
  microenvironment, after T cell activation and proliferation, immune checkpoint proteins,
  such as PD-1 and its ligand PDL-1, are expressed that prevent their excessive activation.
  (B) In a tumor microenvironment, the expression of immune checkpoints favors escape
  from immunosurveillance. Once T cells recognize the tumor antigen presented in HLA-I,
  they are activated and produce IFN-γ that binds to the IFN-γ receptor, inducing
  PD-L1 overexpression in tumor cells. PD-L1 binds to PD-1, which is overregulated
  in T cells, and thus inhibits the immune response. (C) PD-L1 can interact with CD80/CD86
  on the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and disrupt PD-L1/PD-1 binding. It has been
  documented that CD80/CD86 are not only expressed on APCs but also on T cells, suggesting
  that it may be another pathway in T cells that may serve to downregulate responses
  and prevent T cell signals. (D) Anti-PD-1 antibody or anti-PD-L1 blocks the interaction
  of PD-1 and PD-L1 and suppresses the inhibition of CD8+ T cells, thereby enhancing
  antitumor activity.
