caption: DNA repair capacity levels in prostate cancer cases and controls measured
  in terms of NER pathway. Sample distributions using the DRC values for PCa cases
  (n = 41) and controls (n = 14). Each box and whiskers represent the median and range
  values for a study group. Dots and squares represent the individual DRC values for
  PCa cases (green circles) and controls (blue squares). Mean DRC value for each group
  is represented with a plus (+) sign. Asterisk (***) represents significant results
  based on a Mann–Whitney U test, p < 0.001.
