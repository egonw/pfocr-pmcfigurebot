caption: Differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DPPs) (Rps6, Pten, Ywhag, mTOR,
  Magi1, and Pkn2) participate in the PI3K‐AKT signalling pathway were significantly
  different in the therapeutic mechanism of hydrogen in CLP‐induced mice. (A) The
  western blot were used to identify the differentially expressed phosphoproteins
  and the total proteins. The results showed there were no changes in the total level
  of Ywhag, mTOR, and Magi1 quantified by the ratio of band density to those of β‐actin,
  respectively (B) and the MS/MS spectrums from Phosphorylated peptides. (C) (p‐Ywhag
  assigned to TSADGNEKK; p‐Magi1 assigned to AENEVPSPASSHHSSNQPASLTEEK; p‐mTOR assigned
  to IMLRMAPDYDHLTLMQKVEVFEHAVNNTAGDDLAK). The b and y ions including loss of ammonia
  and water were considered when we calculated the PTM score.) (D) The expression
  of Rps6, p‐Rps6, Pten, p‐Pten, mTOR, p‐mTOR, Pkn2, and p‐Pkn2 in CLP + H2 were detected
  by western blot. Quantitative analysis of p‐Rps6, p‐Pten, p‐mTOR, and p‐Pkn2 is
  shown as the ratio of band density to that of Rps6, Pten, mTOR, and Pkn2, respectively.
  NS, no significance; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Magi1, membrane‐associated
  guanylate kinase1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; Pkn2, protein kinase N2;
  Pten, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten; Rps6, Ribosomal
