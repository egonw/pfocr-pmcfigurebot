figure_title: CRTC-CREB signaling is essential to maintain redox and proteostatic
  homeostasis
caption: 'a ROS level in guts measured by DHE ex vivo live imaging. b JAK/STAT pathway
  activity monitored by 2xStat-GFP reporter. Genotypes for a, b NP1-Gal4, UAS-tubGal80ts;2xStat-GFP.
  Scale bars: 50 um. n = 6 for each condition. c Mitotic ISCs were quantified by anti-phospho-histone
  H3 staining. n = 12 for each condition. One-way ANOVA for statistical analysis.
  ****P < 0.0001. d Relative upd3 transcripts was quantified in guts by RT-qPCR. Student’s
  t-test for statistical analysis. **P < 0.01. Samples were run in triplicates. e
  Survival curve of female flies after paraquat treatment. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox test)
  for analysis. n = 60 flies for each condition. P < 0.0001. f Clustered heatmap analysis
  of genes changed by CRTC overexpression. Genes involves in oxidative stress response,
  chaperones and proteasome subunits are significantly upregulated by CRTC overexpression.
  RU (-): Mock condition, RU (+): RU486 induction. Genotype: 5966-GS-GAL4, UAS-CRTC-HA.
  g Relative transcripts of genes was quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized with Rp49.
  Genotypes: NP1-Gal4ts; UAS-CRTC-HA. Samples were run in triplicates. Student’s t-test
  for statistical analysis. **P < 0.01. *P < 0.05.'
