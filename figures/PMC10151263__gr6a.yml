caption: 'Expression of LC3I, LC3II, and p62 in the liver of SD rats after the intervention.
  The expression of LC3I, LC3II, and p62 in the liver of SD rats was detected by WB
  and IFT (n = 6). The data were expressed as the mean standard deviation of three
  independent experiments. (A) Protein expression of LC3I, LC3II, and p62 in the liver
  of rats in each group (supplementary material: Fig. S6(A)-LC3I II; Fig. S6(A)-p62;
  Fig. S6(A)-GAPDH); (B) Gray value of LC3II/I protein expression in the liver of
  rats in each group; (C) Gray value of the p62 protein expression in the liver of
  rats in each group; (D) Immunofluorescence expression of LC3 in the liver of rats
  in each group; (E) LC3 immunofluorescence nuclear count of rat liver in each group;
  (F) Immunofluorescence expression of p62 in the liver of rats in each group; (G)
  p62 immunofluorescence nuclear count of rat liver in each group. Compared with the
  marked group in the figure, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001 or ****P < 0.0001.'
