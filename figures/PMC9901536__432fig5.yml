caption: Senescence and EC IFNγ cooperate to upregulate antigen processing and presentation
  machinery. A and B, mRNA expression of genes in proliferating and senescent NSP
  cells in vitro in the presence or absence of IFNγ (50 pg/mL) treatment. mRNA level
  is normalized to the mean expression of the gene in all samples. A, DEG-encoding
  SASP factors in our model. B, IFNγ response genes from the Hallmark signature database.
  C, RT-qPCR of selected antigen presentation pathway genes in proliferating and senescent
  cells treated with low (50 pg/mL) or high (1 ng/mL) concentration of IFNγ. Samples
  are from 2 biological replicates. D, MHC-I level of proliferating and senescent
  cells treated with IFNγ for 24 hours measured by flow cytometry. MFI, median fluorescence
  intensity. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
