caption: Microtubule-associated proteins are revealed as vulnerabilities in BLCA cells.
  (A) CHRONOS score for the KATNB1 gene across all cancer cell lines and types in
  DepMap. BLCA cells are among the most dependent cancer types. (B) Normalized ATAC-seq.
  tracks of the KATNB1 gene locus in 7 representative samples from various cancer
  types predicted to depend on KATNB1. Kidney cancer is used as a negative control.
