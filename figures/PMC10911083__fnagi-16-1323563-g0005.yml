caption: Gap junction proteins are affected by fasudil treatment. Differentially expressed
  proteins in the brain of PS19 mice compared to NC mice (A), and PS19 mice dosed
  with 100 mg/kg/day fasudil compared to vehicle-dosed mice (B) obtained from the
  KEGG pathway for Gap junction (MMU04540) ranked among the top significantly enriched
  pathways in PS19 transgenic mice and after treatment with fasudil.
article_title: Effect of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil on the brain proteomic profile
  in the tau transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
