caption: DPC-Exos regulated the HF growth and HFSC proliferation through the Wnt3a/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. (a, b) The Wnt3a expression and mRNA expression of the genes
  related to HF growth and development were regulated by DPC-Exos. (c) The DPC-ExosOE-Wnt3a
  promoted the proliferation of HFSCs. (d) The DPC-ExosKD-Wnt3a inhibited the proliferation
  of HFSCs. (e) The DPC-ExosOE-Wnt3a inhibited the HFSC apoptosis. (f) The DPC-ExosKD-Wnt3a
  promoted the HFSC apoptosis. ∗∗P < 0.01. ∗P < 0.05.
