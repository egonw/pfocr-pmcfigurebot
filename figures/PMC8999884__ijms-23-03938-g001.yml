caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) enhances human endometrial epithelial
  cell proliferation through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway.
  (A) Cell proliferation increased dose-dependently by 2, 5, 7.5, 10, and 25 µM DEHP
  treatment for 24 and 48 h; (B) photomicrographs (100×) under a phase contrast microscope
  showing cell morphology in the control and DEHP-treated cells for 24 and 48 h; (C)
  representative fluorescence micrographs of Ki-67 staining (blue: DAPI; red: Ki-67).
  Cells treated with 25 μM DEHP for 48 h show a strong nuclear immunostaining. All
  data are expressed as relative values against their respective control group. Data
  represent the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p <
  0.05 (vs. 24 h control), # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 (vs. 48 h control). Scale bars
  = 10 μm.'
