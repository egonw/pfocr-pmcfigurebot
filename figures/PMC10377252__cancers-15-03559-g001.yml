caption: 'ACC-TCGA analysis identifies Wnt/β-catenin-associated ECM: (A). Independent
  component analysis of the TCGA transcriptome dataset in ACC identified a signature
  of coordinately expressed genes. A.U. stands for arbitrary units. (B). GSEA identified
  that the signature was enriched for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expression
  of ECM and ECM-adhesion genes. (C). Kaplan–Meier analysis of the TCGA cohort indicated
  that patients with component signature expression above the median show shorter
  overall survival (OS) (high score n = 39, low score n = 39). An expression higher
  (n = 24) or lower (n = 24) than the median also predicted shorter disease-free survival
  (DFS). (D). The rxpression of COL11A1, COL26A1, ITGA2, and LAMC3 was significantly
  correlated with a Wnt score representing the expression of bona fide Wnt/β-catenin
  target genes AXIN2, LEF1, APCDD1, NKD1, and LGR5.'
