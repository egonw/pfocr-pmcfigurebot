caption: Single-cell analysis reveals hepatocytes with Smo activity localize in midlobular
  region. (A) UMAP plot of 6895 hepatocytes. (B) Expression of Cyp2f2 and Glul. (C)
  Cell origin annotation. (D) Percent contribution of cells from AAV8-TBG-Luciferase
  (blue) and AAV8-TBG-Cre (red) treated mice in each hepatocyte cluster. (E) Heatmap
  showing correlation between Smo hepatocytes and zonal layers. (F) Enrichment analysis
  showing downregulation of Hedgehog pathway in Smo-KO hepatocytes.
