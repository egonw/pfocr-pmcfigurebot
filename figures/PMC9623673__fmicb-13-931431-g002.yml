caption: The biomarkers and pathway in RA based on plasma metabolomics. (A) The three
  significant pathways are based on 10 differential metabolites between RA and HCs
  (Pathway impact < 0.2, −log10(p) value > 1.5 and greater metabolic abundance). (B)
  The metabolite content differences between RA and HC. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  ≤ 0.001. (C) The correlation heatmap between metabolites and clinical information.
  (D) The ROC curve of the combination of 10 differential metabolites for classifying
  RA patients from HC. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; HC, healthy control; DAS28, disease
  activity score-28; TJC28, tender joint count 28; SJC28, joint swelling count 28;
  ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C-reactive protein; RF, rheumatoid factor;
  WBC, white blood cell count; LY, lymphocyte count; NEUT, neutrophil count; MONO,
  monocyte count; HB, hemoglobin; PLT, platelet count, ROC, receiver operating characteristic.
