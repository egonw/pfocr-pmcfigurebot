caption: (A) A graphical illustration of canonical (left) and non-canonical (right)
  TGF-β signaling. In canonical TGF-β signaling, TGF-β ligand binds to TGFβRI (TβRI)
  and TGFβRII (TβRII) receptors, resulting in their activation in a hetero-tetrameric
  complex. The intracellular Smad2/3 are next activated by phosphorylation, initiated
  by TGFβRI; pSmad2/3 form a complex with Smad4 and, together with certain transcription
  factors (TF), activate specific targets genes that contain Smad-binding elements
  (SBEs), implicated in growth inhibition, apoptosis, ECM synthesis, and immune response.
  In the non-canonical signaling pathway, TGF-β induces the expression of TRAF6 and
  ubiquitinates it in a Lys63-dependent manner, promoting its catalytic activity.
  TRAF6 then activates TACE and PSEN1, resulting in the proteolytic cleavage of TGFβRI,
  generating the soluble TGFβRI intracellular domain (TGFβRI-ICD/ TβRI-ICD). The endosomal
  adaptor proteins APPL1/APPL2 and intact microtubules are required for the translocation
  of TGFβRI-ICD to the nucleus, where it contributes to activating specific target
  genes. Other modes of non-canonical TGF-β signaling pathways are also shown. Adapted
  from [,,,,,,,,]. (B) TGF-β signaling can also induce EMT through the activation
  of non-Smad pathways such as Rho GTPase and via the phosphorylation of the polarity
  protein PAR6, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and the breakdown of epithelial
  cell junctions, respectively. Adapted from [,,,,].
