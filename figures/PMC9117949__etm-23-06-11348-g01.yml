caption: 'Effects of LEN on oxidative stress level in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells.
  (A-D) The production of (A) MDA, (B) SOD, (C) GSH-Px and (D) CAT in H2O2-stimulated
  PC12 cells in the presence and absence of LEN at different doses, detected by corresponding
  commercial kits. (E) Relative protein expression of oxidative stress-related Nox2
  and Nox4 in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells in the presence and absence of LEN at different
  doses, detected by western blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control;
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. H2O2. LEN, lenalidomide; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase; GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; CAT, catalase; Nox, NADPH
  oxidase.'
