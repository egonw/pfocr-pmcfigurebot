figure_title: Genomic profile of Rb-proficient SCLC
caption: '(A) OncoPrint depicting the most prevalent recurrent genomic alterations
  in Rb-proficient SCLC. Tumors were grouped by NSCLC components in combined carcinomas.
  Alteration rates in Rb-proficient SCLC were compared to those in Rb-deficient SCLC.
  In addition, gene alteration prevalence in other major lung cancer types (LCNEC,
  LUSC, and LADC) are represented using the bubble plot based on the prospective MSK-IMPACT
  clinical sequencing cohort as registered in cBioPortal (accessed January 2022).
  LCNEC: large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, LUSC: lung squamous cell carcinoma,
  LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma, TMB: tumor mutation burden score. All comparisons vs.
  Rb proficient SCLC. (â€ ) Shown are amplifications and canonical driver alterations.
  For EGFR, group comparison results are based on amplification events only.(B) Cell
  cycle pathway by PathwayMapper (cBioPortal) showing a high rate of alterations converging
  on activation of CDK4/6.'
