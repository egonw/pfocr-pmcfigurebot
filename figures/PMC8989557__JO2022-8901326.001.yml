caption: 'Mechanism of T cells in immunomodulation in cancer therapy. (a) T cells
  activate the first signal: CD4+ T cells bind to MHC-I signal carrying tumor antigen,
  and CD8+ T cells bind to MHC-I signal carrying tumor antigen; T cells activate the
  second signal: CD28 molecule binds to B7 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.
  (b) CD4+ T cells, as helper T cells, enhance the antitumor effect mainly by stimulating
  the activation of CD8+ T cells; as cytotoxic cells, CD8+ T cells kill tumor cells
  mainly through Fas/FasL pathway and granule exocytosis pathway.'
