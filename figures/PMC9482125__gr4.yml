caption: 'CyR61 does not regulate the expression of H2S-producing enzymes or the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. A,B: Western blot analysis of CyR61, H2S enzymes and Wnt/β-Catenin pathway
  markers in wild-type HCT116 cells, ShCTR cells (i.e. cells treated with non-coding
  vector) and three HCT116 cell lines with CyR61 silencing. Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM of at least 4 independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to
  control.'
