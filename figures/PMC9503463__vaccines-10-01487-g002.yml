caption: NLRC5 signaling pathway. As a result of the interaction of NOD-like receptor
  C5 NLRC5 with IκB kinase alpha/beta (IKKα/β), the NEMO IKKα/β complex is not formed
  and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression is stopped. The interaction of NLRC5
  with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and RIG-I leads to the formation
  of a complex of NLRC5 plus MAVS and RIG-I, which contributes to the expression of
  IFN I. Overexpression of NLCR5 activates caspase 1 (CASP1), which converts pro-IL-1β
  to active IL-1β.
