caption: Determination of biological functions and gene regulatory pathway. The bar
  graphs of enrichment analysis of shared DEGs among CD, UC, CEL, and IBD-CA present
  that cuproptosis was closely related to mitochondrial respiratory functions. The
  enriched gene regulatory networks represent the association between genes and regulatory
  factors, red dots presented in circles represent the genes, and green diamond dots
  present miRNAs, green polygonal dots present TFs. (A) WikiPathway. (B) KEGG 2019
  human pathway. (C) Reactome pathway. (D) Biological Processes. (E) Molecular Function.
  (F) Cellular Component. (G) DEGs-miRNA networks. (H) DEGs-TFs networks.
