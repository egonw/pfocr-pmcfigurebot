caption: Coq9 is required for efficient CoQ biosynthesis. (A) Graphical representation
  of AtCoq9 gene and position of gRNA. Exons are indicated by gray boxes. The CRISPR-Cas9-targeted
  sequence is shown in black, and the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence is
  shown in red. (B) DNA sequencing indicates the 1 bp insertion (red) in the obtained
  coq9-1 and coq9-3 mutants. (C) Relative content of CoQ9 in extracts of rosettes
  in WT, coq9-1, and coq9-3. Data are means of four to five biological replicates
  Â± SE.
