caption: Vitamins supplements promote Vero cell proliferation. (A) Effect of different
  vitamin concentrations on Vero cell proliferation. Different concentrations of vitamin
  B were added to Vero with the same density. After 96 h of culture under the same
  conditions, the total number of cells was detected by CountStar. The cell number
  ratios were calculated and the histogram was drawn for t-test. (B) Cell proliferation
  curve detection. Using CCK8 reagent to detect the OD450/650 of Vero cells at the
  designated time point and draw the proliferation curve, t-tests were counted on
  day 6. (C) Effect of cell proliferation by EdU test. The cells were stained with
  EdU (red) and DAPI (blue). The percentage of Edu-positive cells is shown on the
  right and the histogram was drawn for the t-test. (D) Vitamins supplements improve
  the expression of PCNA and Ki67 both of mRNA (left) and protein (right) level expression.
