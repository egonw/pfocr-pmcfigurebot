caption: 'Cell viability (CCK-8) assay results of RLE-6TN cells. (a) H2O2-induced
  cell proliferation rate (concentration-dependent); (b) H2O2-induced cell proliferation
  rate (time-dependent); (c) 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B treatment of the H2O2-challenged
  cells. Low: 2.5 μg/mL 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B-treated RLE-6TN cell group; mid:
  5 μg/mL 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin B-treated RLE-6TN cell group; high: 10 μg/mL 4,7-didehydro-neophysalin
  B-treated RLE-6TN cell group; the same as below. Compared with the blank group,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Compared with the model group, #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001.'
