caption: Immune and metabolic profile by scMEP. A and B, mDC were generated in vitro
  in the presence of OVA, nAFP, and tAFP and analysis of the immune-metabolic profile
  was determined by scMEP using CyTOF. Shown are the arcsinh-transformed values for
  immune response–related molecules (A) and metabolic pathway proteins (B). C, A schematic
  is shown to summarize the tAFP-induced immune-metabolic changes. D, A heatmap of
  various metabolic markers was generated and hierarchical clustering was performed
  on the basis of marker expression and treatment condition. The red box indicates
  the unique clustering of the tAFP-treated cells. Data are representative of three
  separate healthy donors, each performed in a single replicate.
