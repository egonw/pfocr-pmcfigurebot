caption: Model for activation of Ca2+signaling by HCV C. (A) The immature C (p23)
  protein with intact transmembrane (TM) domain (also known as D3) and capacity to
  self-associate into oligomeric structures at the ER membrane, enables Ca2+ efflux
  from ER into the cytosol. After p23 is processed by SPP, the mature p21 protein
  is transported to the lipid droplets. (B) The immature p23 with intact TM domain,
  but defective in C-C interactions, does not perturb the ER membrane and hinders
  Ca2+ efflux (e.g., ∆2–18, ∆61–68). The localization of the mature form (p21) to
  lipid droplets is retained. (C) The immature form p23 with deletions in domain 2
  (e.g., ∆124–142, ∆147–161) allows membrane perturbation prior to processing, but
  is rapidly degraded after maturation by SPP. (D) The C proteins with truncated TM
  domain (e.g., 1–173) do not allow Ca2+ efflux but are transported into lipid droplets.
  (E) The intermediate p23 deficient in SPP cleavage (e.g., spmt, ∆81–123) is retained
  in the ER membrane and is hyperactive for Ca2+ efflux.
