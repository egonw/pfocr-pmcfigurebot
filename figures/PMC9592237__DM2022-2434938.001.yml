caption: LINC01140 overexpression suppressed BC cell proliferation and migration and
  facilitated apoptosis in vitro. (a) RT-qPCR was utilized for measuring LINC01140
  expression in normal MCF-10A cells and BC cells (HCC1937, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231).
  ∗∗P < 0.001 vs MCF-10A. (b) RT-qPCR was utilized for measuring LINC01140 level in
  BC tissues and adjacent tissues. ∗∗P < 0.001. (c) Subcellular localization was utilized
  for measuring LINC01140 expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear of HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231
  cells. (d) HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 were transfected with LINC01140 overexpression
  vector (LINC01140-OE) and its corresponding negative control (empty vector). LINC01140
  expression in these transfected cells was measured by RT-qPCR. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty
  vector. (e) Cell viability in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells delivered empty vector
  and LINC01140-OE, as uncovered utilizing CCK-8 assay. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty vector.
  (f) Migrated cells were counted utilizing transwell in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  delivered empty vector and LINC01140-OE. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty vector. (g) Bax and
  Bcl-2 protein levels was uncovered utilizing western blotting analysis in HCC1937
  and MDA-MB-231 cells delivered empty vector and LINC01140-OE. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty
  vector.
