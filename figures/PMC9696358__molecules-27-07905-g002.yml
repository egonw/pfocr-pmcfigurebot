caption: Multiple pathways via which MGO induces oxidative stress, pain, anxiolytic
  effects, and ageing. The pathways activated by MGO induce oxidative stress, which
  may play a role in ageing. The formation of AGEs involves nonenzymatic reactions
  that occur when sugars or dicarbonyl compounds, such as MGO, are reduced. Research
  has been conducted on the connection between neuropathic pain and the transient
  receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) pathway. MGO mediates the anxiolytic effect
  via the modulation of GABAergic actions. MGO mediates ERK-, JNK-, and p38-dependent
  endothelial cell inflammatory responses, which may occur independently of oxidative
  stress. In addition, BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) accesses mitochondria to induce
  cytochrome c release, and Bcl-2 inhibits BAX translocation from cytosol to mitochondria
  during relevant apoptosis. MGO induces the expression of phosphorylated tau protein
  and increases the expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK-3β). A reduction in Aβ deposition can eventually improve learning
  and memory ability. AGE interaction with the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) carries an
  implication for AD. Glycated Aβ (Aβ-AGE) can aggravate an AD-like pathology via
  the receptor for the RAGE pathway. MGO increases intracellular calcium in sensory
  neurons and produces neuropathic pain via the cation TRPA1 channel.
