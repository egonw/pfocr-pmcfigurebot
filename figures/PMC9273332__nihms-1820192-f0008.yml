caption: 'Inference of underlying network architectures for Bcl11b KO response and
  its relationship with an initial Phase 1 T progression circuit (A) Input-target
  relationship matrix for validated Bcl11b-repressed DEGs within the Bcl11b KO-upregulated
  regulons. Red cells in matrix indicate that a given gene listed (columns) is a member
  of a given regulon (rows). Flow chart of data analysis logic and threshold criteria
  is shown in , from full data in . Panel shows that individual Bcl11b-repressed DEGs()
  often can be members of more than one indicated regulon, and that the cases where
  the same gene is a member of more than one regulon fall roughly into three pattern
  groups. (B) Identification of an early T-lineage progression-associated regulon
  ensemble among Phase 1-defined regulons (). Klf4 regulon, identifiable from data
  in the pooled-perturbation experiment, is in parentheses here and below because
  Klf4 is minimal or absent in normal pro-T cells. Flow chart of selection criteria
  is shown in , using data from . Panel shows number of individual genes in each Spi1
  KO-enriched Phase 1 regulon that overlap with validated PU.1-activated or PU.1-repressed
  DEGs(). Red: highly significant bias favoring overlap with PU.1-repressed rather
  than PU.1-activated DEGs. Fisher’s exact test p values are given in . (C) Extensive
  overlap in Phase 1 regulon memberships among PU.1-repressed DEGs. Full gene lists
  are given in . A live interactive model of predicted gene network relationships
  across all the regulon-DEG intersection genes in this analysis (http://bioinfoweb.caltech.edu/tf_targets/)
  is shown in . (D) Highly-interconnected transcription factor network associated
  with progress through T-lineage specification is predicted by shared regulon memberships
  of genes that encode major PU.1-repressed Phase 1 transcription factors themselves.
  Network model uses the Biotapestry graphic framework (), which displays oriented
  gene networks in which regulator is identified as distinct from target, with arrows
  pointing from regulator to target gene’s control sequences. Shown are the relationships
  between regulons enriched in Spi1 (PU.1) KO samples that also have PU.1-repressed
  transcription factor genes among their members, based on , , and (). PU.1 is depicted
  as a repressor (line with blocked end) of all the genes and regulons (rgln) shown
  in the dashed box. Gene models, horizontal lines with bent arrows, here represent
  transcription factor coding genes seen to be transcriptionally repressed by PU.1.
  Filled circles represent transcription factor protein activities inferred from activities
  of their regulons, as shown in panel (B). Arrows represent mapping of regulon transcription
  factors to putative gene targets, based on their regulon memberships. Different
  regulons are depicted with different colored lines to help trace each putative regulator
  (circle) to its various targets. Transcription factor coding genes in this circuit
  are given the same color as the circles representing the factors they encode and
  the arrows connecting their activities to target genes in their regulons. Regulon
  membership is depicted as positive regulation here (pointed arrows) but could include
  negative regulation in some cases. Klf4 rgln: seen here to be upregulated in Spi1
  KO, but shown in parentheses because not normally expressed in early pro-T cells.
  (E) Venn diagram of relationship between validated Bcl11b KO DEGs() and validated
  Spi1 (PU.1) KO DEGs(): no preferential association seen between Bcl11b-dependent
  “commitment” genes and PU.1-repressed “T lineage progression” genes. (F) Genes that
  are both Bcl11b-dependent DEGs and PU.1-repressed DEGs are separate from Phase 1
  progression-associated (specification-associated) regulon membership. Phase 1 regulon
  member pool here includes whole regulon memberships of Ets1-ext, Tcf12-ext, E2f2-ext,
  Egr1-ext, Tcf7, Runx3-ext, JunD, Myb-ext, and Nfkb1-ext. (G) Biotapestry gene network
  model of predicted inputs from Phase 1 progression-associated transcription factors
  into transcription factor genes that are Bcl11b-repressed, based on memberships
  of the Phase 1 regulons. Relationships are depicted as in (D), with the same color
  code for the same factors encoded by the genes shown in (D). For gene lists see
