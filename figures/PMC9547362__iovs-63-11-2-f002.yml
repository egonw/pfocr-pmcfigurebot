caption: Inflammatory cell infiltration was elevated and inflammatory factor levels
  were increased in the fungal keratitis model. (A) Histopathological analysis after
  HE staining of mouse corneas from the F. solani and control groups. Scale bar =
  50 µm. (B-D) The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA were analyzed by RT–PCR.
  (E-G) ELISA results showing IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α protein levels in mouse fungal
  corneas in each group; n = 6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
article_title: Inhibition of the m6A Methyltransferase METTL3 Attenuates the Inflammatory
  Response in Fusarium solani-Induced Keratitis via the NF-κB Signaling Pathway.
