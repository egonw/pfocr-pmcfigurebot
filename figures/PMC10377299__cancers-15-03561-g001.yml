caption: MET signaling pathway and blockade by MET inhibitors. In cancer, the MET
  proto-oncogene is abnormally activated and stimulates other signaling pathways in
  tumor cells, notably PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, Ras/MAPK, SRC, and Wnt/beta-catenin [].
  Type 1a inhibitor crizotinib blocks ATP binding to prevent the phosphorylation of
  the receptor, whereas type 1b inhibitors such as capmatinib are more specific and
  bind to a pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site. This figure was generated by
  BioRender.
