figure_title: Extended phenotyping of double negative (DN) B cells
caption: Gating DN B cells for CD21 vs. CXCR5 revealed two dominant populations being
  either double positive or negative for both markers (A). CD11c and CD95 surface
  expression on DN B cells correlated positively (B). The frequency of DN2 and active
  naïve B cells were related to SARS-CoV-2 viral load (C).
