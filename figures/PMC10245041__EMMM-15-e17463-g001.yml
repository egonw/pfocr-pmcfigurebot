figure_title: Proteome changes identify common processes in the mutant lines that
  reflect their tumorigenic profiles
caption: 'A–DProteomic changes in prostates that are in common in the KO (n = 5 biological
  replicates) and A537T (n = 5 biological replicates) mice compared with WT control
  mice (n = 5 biological replicates) at 30 weeks based on the Reactome pathway determined
  using PANTHER. (A) Specific protein changes that were in common between the KO and
  A537T lines at 30 weeks are shown in volcano plots; (B) increased proteins are shown
  in red and reduced proteins are shown in blue. The top 20 most significant pathways
  that are based on proteome changes in common between KO‐TRAMP (n = 5 biological
  replicates) and A537T‐TRAMP (n = 5 biological replicates) mice relative to WT‐TRAMP
  (n = 5) mice at 30 weeks (C) and specific protein changes (D). Data information:
  In panels (A and C), the intersect results show the top 20 pathways with the highest
  −log10 (FDR) for each line, relative to the respective control, that are also identified
  as significant in the corresponding mouse line. The colour scale represents fold
  change (FC) for each pathway, and set size is the number of genes within each pathway.'
