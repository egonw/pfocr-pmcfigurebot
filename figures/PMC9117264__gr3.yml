caption: Pan-cancer survival analysis based on pathway activity. (a) The number of
  favourable and unfavourable pathways in survival analysis among cancer types. (b)
  Pathways significantly associated with patient survival in multiple cancer types.
  The x-axis shows the number of survival-related cancer types for each pathway. The
  colour of bar indicates the mean value of hazard ratio (HR) of survival analysis
  for each pathway in these cancer types. (c) The most favourable and unfavourable
  pathways in survival analysis among pan-cancer. Each box in boxplots was built on
  the HRs of the pathway in survival analysis among the different cancer types. (d)
  Heatmap of 318 KEGG pathways in survival analysis. Data are showed by the HRs of
  pathways in survival analysis. The red colour represent that the pathway is associated
  with poor prognosis, while blue colour is associated with good prognosis. (e) Bar
  chat shows the pathway with the highest C-index for each cancer types. (f) Performance
  comparison of different pathway activity algorithms on survival prediction. Each
  box in boxplots was built on the average C-index of five-fold cross-validation for
  100 random repeats across the pan-cancer data from TCGA. The significance tests
  of C-index between IPAM and other pathway activity algorithms were conducted using
  Student's t-test.
