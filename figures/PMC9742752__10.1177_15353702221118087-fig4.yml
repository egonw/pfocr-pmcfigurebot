caption: 'Celastrol treatment attenuated renal fibrosis and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad3
  signaling pathway in 5/6Nx rats: (A) RT-time PCR revealed that celastrol reversed
  the increase in mRNA expression levels of α-SMA and Col4a1. (B and C) The protein
  expression levels of α-SMA and Col4a1 were evaluated using western blot and quantitative
  analysis. (D) The mRNA expressions levels of Smad3 and TGF-β1 in different kidney
  tissues. (E and F) The protein expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad3 and P-Smad3 were
  evaluated using western blot and representative western blot analyses. Data are
  presented as the mean ± inter-quartile range, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with
  the sham control group.'
