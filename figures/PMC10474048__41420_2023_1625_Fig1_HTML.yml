figure_title: Preparation of human prostate cancer cells with KIF15 knockdown
caption: A Detection of KIF15 expression in normal tissues and prostate cancer tissues
  with different pathological stages by IHC. B The IHC scores of normal tissues and
  prostate cancer tissues were collected and compared. C The differential expression
  of KIF15 in prostate cancer tissues and normal tissues was analyzed based on the
  data collected from the TCGA-PRAD dataset. D The correlation between KIF15 expression
  and prostate cancer patients’ prognosis (progression-free survival and overall survival)
  was analyzed based on the data collected from the TCGA-PRAD dataset. E The endogenous
  expression of KIF15 in immortalized cells of human normal prostate matrix WPMY-1
  and human prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3, DU 145, and C4-2, was detected
  by qPCR and western blot analysis, respectively. F The screening of more efficient
  shRNA was completed by qPCR. G The fluorescence of cells, which were infected with
  shCtrl or shKIF15 for 72 h, observed by microscope demonstrates a >80% efficiency
  of infection. H&I, The knockdown efficiencies of KIF15 in DU 145 and PC-3 cells
  were detected by qPCR (H) and western blot analysis (I). Data were shown as Mean
  with SD. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
