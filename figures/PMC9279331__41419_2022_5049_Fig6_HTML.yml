figure_title: SKI-349 administration inhibits NSCLC xenograft in nude mice
caption: The mice bearing pNSCLC-1 xenografts were subject to the applied SKI-349
  administration or vehicle control treatment (“Veh”), with 10 mice per group (n = 10).
  The tumor volumes (A) and the mice body weights (D) were measured every 6 days (“Day-0”
  to “Day-42”); The estimated daily tumor growth (B) and weights of pNSCLC-1 xenografts
  at “Day-42” (C) were measured. At “Day-6” and “Day-12”, one pNSCLC-1 tumor per group
  were isolated, and the relative SphK activity was tested (E). Expression of listed
  genes and proteins in the described tumor tissues were tested (F, G, H, J, K, L
  and M). The relative lipid peroxidation intensity (TBAR activity, (I)) was examined
  as well. The proposed signaling pathway of the study (N). Data were presented as
  mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 versus “Veh” treatment. “n.s.” stands for non-statistical difference
  (P > 0.05).
