caption: GOT1/2 mediates amino acid metabolism regulated by HGD/GSTZ1. (A,B) The core-enriched
  signaling pathways in high and low HGD or GSTZ1 groups. NES, normalized enrichment
  score. (C,D) GSEA pathway enrichment analyses of HGD or GSTZ1 signature in patients
  with RCC from the TCGA datasets. (E) The overlapping analysis for related genes
  of amino acid metabolism in RCC patients. (F,G) The core-enriched signaling pathways
  in high and low GOT1 or GOT2 groups. NES, normalized enrichment score. (H) The mRNA
  and protein expression levels of GOT1 and GOT2 between tumor and normal tissues
  in patients with KIRC in TGCA database. (I) The expression correlation between HGD/GSTZ1
  and GOT1/GOT2. *** p < 0.001.
