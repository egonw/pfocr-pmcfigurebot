caption: MOB1 acetylation mediates oxidative stress regulation of the Hippo pathway.
  (A and B) H1299 cells were incubated in the culture medium with or without 1 mM
  NAC, and treated with 100 mg/mL CHX for indicated hours before harvesting. Cells
  were lysed and endogenous MOB1 were detected by western blot analysis with MOB1
  Ab (A). The curves were plotted based on the gray value of the bands of endogenous
  MOB1 in (A) by software Image J and GraphPad Prism 6. Error bars represented means ± SD.
  According to two-tailed Student’s t-test,* is for P< 0.05 and ** is for P< 0.01.
  Images and statistical results were based on three independent experiments (B).
  (C and D) H1299 cells were transfected with FLAG-MOB1-K11R mutant plasmids, cultured
  in medium with or without 1 mM NAC and treated with 100 mg/ml CHX for indicated
  hours before harvesting. Cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis with
  FLAG Ab and Actin Ab (C). The curves were plotted based on the grey value of the
  bands of FLAG-MOB1-K11R mutant in (C) by software ImageJ and GraphPad Prism 6. Error
  bars represented means ± SD. According to two-tailed Student’s t-test, ‘ns’ is for
  no significance, P> 0.05. Images and statistical results were based on three independent
  experiments (D). (E) FLAG-MOB1 and HA-Ubiquitin were coexpressed in H1299 cells
  and treated with 25 μM MG132 for 12 h combined with 1 mM sodium arsenite for 1 h,
  1 mM H2O2 for 1 h or 1 mM NAC for 12–24 h before harvesting. Cell lysates were subjected
  to immunoprecipitation with M2-Beads (anti-FLAG), and then immunoblotted with the
  antibodies to Ubiquitin, FLAG and AcK11-MOB1. (F and G) Two groups of H1299 KO cells
  (each group consisted of six dishes) were transfected with FLAG-MOB1 (WT or K11R
  mutant) respectively, following by using different concentration of sodium arsenite
  to treat cells for 1 h before harvesting. Cells were lysed, implemented western
  blot analysis and analyzed by antibodies as indicated in the figure (F). The gray
  value of the bands of p-YAP (S127) and YAP was determined by software ImageJ. Relative
  amount of p-YAP (S127) / YAP was analyzed and plotted by GraphPad Prism 6. Error
  bars represented means ± SEM. According to two-tailed Student’s t-test,* is for
  P< 0.05, ** is for P< 0.01 and **** is for P< 0.0001. Images and statistical results
  were based on three independent experiments (G).
