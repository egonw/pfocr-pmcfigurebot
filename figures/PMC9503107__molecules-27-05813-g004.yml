caption: 'Effect of CNP extract on mRNA or gene expression levels of cellular antioxidant
  enzymes in HT22 cells. The cells were incubated with CNP extract (10–50 µg/mL) or
  5 µM resveratrol as a positive control, and then the cells were harvested and the
  gene expression was measured. The levels of mRNA expression, such as (a) SOD1, (b)
  SOD2, (c) CAT, and (d) GPx1, were determined via quantitative real-time PCR. The
  data are shown as relative to mRNA expression and normalized by β-actin. Values
  are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). Note: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001 versus non-treated control.'
