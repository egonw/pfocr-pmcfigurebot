caption: High expression of MCM10 in MCF10A cells. A) MCM10 expression monitored by
  3x-FLAG and MCM10 using western blotting. B) mRNA quantification showing significant
  increase in MCM10 mRNA expression in MCF10A-OE cells compared to control. C) Bar
  graph showing a significant increase in cell proliferation in MCF10A-OE cells at
  different time points compared to control, monitored and analyzed using Incucyte
  ZOOM analysis software. D) Scattered analysis of apoptosis between control and MCF10A-OE
  cells, monitored by flow cytometer. E) Apoptotic percentage of control and MCF10A-OE
  groups showing no difference. F) Representative images of cell cycle analysis at
  0, 12 and 24 hours after serum starvation by flow cytometer. G) Bar graph of Cell
  cycle analysis at 0 hours, H) at 12 hours and I) at 24 hours. Cell cycle analysis
  showed a relatively decreased percentage of cells in the S-phase and an increased
  percentage of cells in the G2/M phase at 12 hours. Increased percentage of cells
  in G0/G1, S-phase and decreased percentage of cells in G2/M phase in MCF10A-OE cells
  compared to control also been observed at 24 hours suggesting that MCF10A-OE cells
  might relatively shorten their duplication time. J) Protein expression of CDK2 (a
  S-phase cell cycle marker) in control and MCF10A-OE cells at different time points.
  K) Protein expression of AKT-pathway in MCF10A-OE cells and control groups, indicating
  increased proliferation in MCF10A-OE by modulating AKT signaling pathway. The student
  t-test was used to analyze the difference between the two groups and data are presented
  as mean values Â± s.d. Value of p< 0.05 was considered significant (*), while p<
  0.01 was considered markedly significant (**).
