figure_title: Motif analysis for identifying new binding partners of USP7
caption: 'A Schematic overview of the workflow for identifying new binding partners
  of USP7 using binding motifs, DAVID, protein-protein interaction, and binding analyses.
  B The diagram shows the number of proteins having each or both [P/A/E]-X-X-S and
  K-X-X-X-K motifs. C Pathway enrichment of putative substrate proteins of USP7 was
  analyzed by DAVID analysis. Y-axis indicates the pathway name, and X-axis indicates
  gene count in the pathways, and the asterisk indicates the p-value (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001.) D Interaction network between USP7 and putative substrates with high
  interaction score and with or without the connection revealed. The color of nodes
  indicates the confirmation of binding between USP7 and proteins (Gray: published
  and green: nonpublished), and Raf-1 binding with USP7 is shown in purple. Interaction
  network is shown by Cytoscape. E Endogenous USP7 or Raf-1 was precipitated with
  an anti-USP7 or an anti-Raf-1 antibody in HeLa cell lysate. F HEK293T cells were
  transfected with Myc-USP7, and Flag-Raf-1 and immunoprecipitations were performed
  by an anti-Myc or an anti-Flag antibody. G Purified GST- or GST-USP7 expressed in
  BL21 was incubated with Flag-Raf-1-overexpressed HEK293T cells. GST- or GST-USP7
  was pull downed by GST bead and gel was stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. H Immunocytochemical
  analysis was performed to investigate the localization of respective USP7 and Raf-1,
  and co-localization of USP7 and Raf-1.'
