caption: 'Effects of CypA/MMP9 pathway on BBB permeability and synaptic plasticity
  proteins in anesthesia/surgery mice. Inhibition of CypA/MMP9 pathway improves the
  tight junction (TJ) proteins, attenuates the BBB leakage, and increases synaptic
  plasticity proteins in anesthesia/surgery mice. The protein levels of CypA, MMP9
  (A–C), ZO-1, occludin, claudin5 (D–G), PSD95 and synaptophysin (K–M) were assessed
  by western blotting. S100β levels in serum were measured by ELISA (H). IgG leakage
  staining (red fluorescence) was shown in the cortex (I,J). Scale bars: 100 μm. Values
  are expressed as mean ± SEM and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed
  by Tukey’s post-hoc test. n = 3–5 per group. A/S, anesthesia/surgery. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared to control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P
  < 0.001, compared to A/S group.'
