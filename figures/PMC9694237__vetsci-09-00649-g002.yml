caption: 'Effects of hormone treatment on PPARγ and mTOR pathway proteins: (A–E) After
  12 h of hormone treatment, the expression of p70S6K, p-p70S6K, p62, LC3B-I, LC3B-II
  and PPARγ in STCs was determined by Western blotting (). Real-time quantitative
  PCR analysis of (F) ISG15 and (G) PPARγ in STCs. The β-actin gene was used as a
  normalization control. In the CON group, 0.1% DMSO was added. Data are shown as
  the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent trials. Different letters
  above the bars indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).'
