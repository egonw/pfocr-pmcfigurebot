figure_title: The Kennedy pathway and Lands cycle in ferroptosis
caption: 'The Kennedy pathway is critical for de novo phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
  and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes, including
  cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), and lipoprotein-associated
  PLA2 (Lp-PLA2), cleave the sn-2 position of phospholipids, contributing to lysophosphatidylethanolamine
  (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) recycling. The sn-2 position of phospholipids
  favors PUFAs, and PLA2 enzymes release PUFAs, such as AA and oxidized AA, from phospholipids.
  Abbreviations: CCT choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, CK choline kinase, CPT1
  choline phosphotransferase 1, DAG diacylglycerol, ECT ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase,
  EPT1 ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1, G3P glycerol-3-phosphate, LPA lysophosphatidic
  acid, PA phosphatidic acid, PLD phospholipase D.'
