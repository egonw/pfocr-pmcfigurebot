  infiltrating cells (A, B) The correlations of STAT2 and the characteristic genes
  of the ERP in GSE122897 and GSE75436. (C) The immune score and the stromal score
  of intracranial aneurysm (IA) samples compared with controls. (D) The infiltrating
  cells of IA samples compared with controls. (E) The correlation of STAT2 and the
  infiltrating cells. ns=no significance, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
