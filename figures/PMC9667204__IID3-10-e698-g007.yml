caption: Compound C (CC) reversed the effect of diosgenin on the inflammatory response
  and oxidative stress of ARPE‐19 cells induced by high glucose (HG). The levels (A)
  and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (B) of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin
  (IL)‐6, and IL‐1β in HG‐induced ARPE‐19 cells treated with diosgenin and CC were
  detected by assay kits and real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). (C) The
  expression of inflammation‐related proteins (COX‐2 and p65) in HG‐induced ARPE‐19
  cells treated with diosgenin and CC was analyzed by western blotting. (D) The levels
  of SOD, GSH‐Px, and MDA in HG‐induced ARPE‐19 cells treated with diosgenin and CC
  was detected by assay kits. *p < .05, **p < .01 and ***p < .001.
