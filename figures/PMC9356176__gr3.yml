caption: 'Mitochondrial O2consumption and specific mitochondrial electron transport
  Complex IV activity is suppressed in DS fibroblasts; pharmacological inhibition
  of CBS with AOAA improves the bioenergetic phenotype of DS cells without significantly
  affecting the bioenergetics of control cells. (A): Rates of oxygen consumption rate
  (OCR) recorded before and after sequential addition of oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (2 μM)
  and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 μM) to the cells using the Agilent Seahorse XFe24
  Analyzer. (B): Calculated mean values of basal respiration, proton leak, maximal
  respiration, spare respiratory capacity, ATP-linked respiration. (C): Calculated
  mitochondrial coupling efficiency. (D) & (E) Specific activity of mitochondrial
  Complex IV in permeabilized cells. (PMP depicts the administration of the Agilent
  Seahorse XF Plasma Membrane Permeabilizer, a proprietary reagent that permeabilizes
  intact cells in culture.) Each line and bar graph represents the mean ± SEM of n = 8
  human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8 DS fibroblasts, as summarized in . Dotted
  connecting lines in the bar graphs indicate the same cell from a specific donor
  with/without AOAA treatment (3 μM, 24 h). *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01 indicates significant
  differences between DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05 indicates significant
  differences between DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
