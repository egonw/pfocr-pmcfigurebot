caption: Effects of piperine on inhibition of HSC-3 cell viability. (A) The chemical
  structure of piperine. (B) Cell viability of HSC-3 cells treated with piperine (0,
  50, 100, 150, and 200 ÂµM for 24 h). Data are presented as mean and standard deviation
  (SD) for three samples. * p < 0.05, compared with the control group.
