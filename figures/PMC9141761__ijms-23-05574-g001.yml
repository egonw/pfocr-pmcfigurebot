caption: 'Known sites of BVR-A interaction in the insulin signaling pathway. Under
  physiological conditions, the activation of insulin signaling requires the binding
  of insulin to the insulin receptor (IR), which auto-phosphorylates on Tyr residues
  (Y, e.g., Tyr1158/1162/1163) and promotes the receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated
  phosphorylation of its substrate (IRS1) on specific Tyr residues (e.g., 632). In
  parallel, IR phosphorylates BVR-A on specific Tyr residues and activates BVR-A to
  function as Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase. Then, as part of a regulatory loop, BVR-A phosphorylates
  IRS1 on inhibitory Ser residues (S, e.g., Ser307) to avoid IRS1 aberrant activation
  in response to IR. Once activated, IRS1 works as a scaffold protein, driving the
  activation of the two main arms of the insulin signaling: (1) the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway
  (ERK1/2) mainly involved in gene transcription; and (2) the PI3K/Akt axis that is
  critical for glucose uptake as well as for protein and lipid metabolism. Moreover,
  Akt promotes the phosphorylation of several targets, among which are: (1) GSK3β
  (on Ser9, inhibitory site), which has a role in energy production; and (2) mTOR
  (on Ser2448, activating site), which regulates protein synthesis and autophagy.
  Within both axes, BVR-A works as kinase or as scaffold protein facilitating: (1)
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the subsequent translocation in the nucleus and followed
  by the activation of Elk1; (2) the PDK1-mediated activation of Akt; (3) PDK1-mediated
  activation of the atypical PKCζ; (4) the Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK3β. Moreover,
  BVR-A was found to be essential for the AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Under
  condition of energy depletion, AMPK directly senses increases in AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP
  ratios, thus promoting the inhibition of mTOR to block the processes that deplete
  cellular ATP (e.g., protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, controlling cell
  size and preventing apoptosis). Moreover, AMPK is activated in response to nitrosative
  stress and that occurs independently of AMP/ATP levels. Conversely, reduced AMPK
  activation leads to mTOR hyper-activation. Arrows represent stimulation; lines represent
  inhibition. See text for more details.'
