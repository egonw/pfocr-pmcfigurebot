caption: 'BMSCs reduce the expression of TGF-β1, Smad2/3 and p-Smad2/3. Immunohistochemical
  staining was performed to test the expression of TGF-β1. The level of TGF-β1, Smad2/3
  and p-Smad2/3 was checked by Western blot. A: The expression and distribution of
  TGF-β1; B: IOD of TGF-β1 expression in the heart. C. Western blotting analysis of
  TGF-β1, Smad2/3 and p-Smad2/3 in each group. D. Densitometric analysis of western
  blotting for TGF-β1; E. Densitometric analysis of western blotting for Smad2/3 and
  p-Smad2/3. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6 rabbits); Original magnification ×200;
  Scale bar = 100 μm. IOD: integrated optical density. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  vs Control; ##P < 0.01 vs RT.'
