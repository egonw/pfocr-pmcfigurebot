caption: Inhibition of proliferation of liver cancer cells by three T-CMs. A, HepG2
  cells were treated with three T-CMs at concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and
  0.8 mg/mL for 24 h and 48 h, respectively, and then subjected to MTT assays. The
  0.0 mg/mL treatment group was used as a blank control (100% cell activity). B, MTT
  assays of Bel7402 cells treated with three T-CMs for 24 h and 48 h were performed.
  C, Normal human liver cells LO2 were treated with three T-CMs at a dose range of
  0.0 to 2.0 mg/mL for 48 h, then tested for MTT. Each result was expressed by Mean ± SD
  with four replicates and the lower case letters indicated P < 0.05.
