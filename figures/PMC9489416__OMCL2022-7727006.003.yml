caption: RR inhibits the MCU expression and downregulates the expression of NFATc1.
  (a) The BMMs were planted in a 6-well plate, M-CSF and RANKL stimulation were added,
  and 1.5 μM RR was added to stimulate 0 d, 3 d, 5 d, and 7 d, respectively. Western
  blot was used to show protein expression levels of NFATc1, c-Fos, and MCU. (b) Image
  J was used to quantitatively detect the expression of NFATc1, c-Fos, and MCU, normalized
  relatively to GAPDH. (c) After adding M-CSF, RANKL, and different concentrations
  of RR to stimulate BMM for 7 days, protein expression levels of NFATc1 and c-Fos
  were displayed by western blot. (d) Quantitative analysis of protein expression
  levels of NFATc1 and c-Fos, normalized relatively to GAPDH. (e) The RAW264.7 cells
  were treated with or without RANKL and RR for 24 h and 48 h, and then, intracellular
  calcium concentration was measured. Normalized relatively to protein concentrations
  per well. (f) The calcium concentration in supernatant of RAW264.7 cells, normalized
  to protein concentrations. (g) BMM cells were stimulated with RANKL in the presence
  or absence of RR (1.5 μM), and the expression and localization of NFATc1 were analyzed
  using immunofluorescence. Scale bar = 100 μm. Data was presented as means ± SEM;
  n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
