caption: GALNT1 regulates subcutaneous tumor formation and metastasis of gastric cancer
  in mice. A, GALNT1 knockdown inhibited subcutaneous tumor formation in a nude mouse
  model. B-C, Tumor weight (B) and volume (C) analysis of subcutaneous tumors in nude
  mouse models. D, SGC7901 cells with control or GALNT1 knockdown were injected into
  the tail veins of nude mice (n = 7 for each group). Representative images of lung
  taken seven weeks after injection. E, Quantification of metastatic lung tumors by
  hematoxylin & eosin. F, Representative images of metastatic lung tumors performed
  by hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunohistochemistry in mice. Data are shown
  as means ± S.D. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
