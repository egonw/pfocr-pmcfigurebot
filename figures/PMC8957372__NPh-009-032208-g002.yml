caption: Concurrent fMRI and optogenetic manipulations in anesthetized and awake rodents.
  Revised from Refs. 133, 103, 34, 30. Representative experimental designs and results
  from opto-fMRI studies in (a)–(d) anesthetized and (e)–(h) awake rodents. (a) BOLD
  activation maps and (b) hemodynamic response functions in anesthetized rats receiving
  anterior thalamic optogenetic stimulation, illustrating BOLD responses ipsilaterally
  at the site of stimulation and both ipsilaterally and bilaterally in projection
  areas. Optogenetic stimulation can be presented alongside other sensory stimulations
  even in anesthetized rodents, as shown in (c) and (d). (c) Unilateral optogenetic
  stimulation was presented to the MVN (blue lines) concurrently with broadband noise
  stimulation (black bars). (d) The BOLD signal and averaged area under the signal
  profiles show that MVN optogenetic stimulation enhanced broadband noise-induced
  BOLD signaling in ipsilateral auditory pathway regions (IC, MGB, A1, A2). (e) BOLD
  activation maps that were averaged across different optogenetic stimulation paradigms
  targeting the IL in awake rats, showing activation patterns in both cortical and
  subcortical areas receiving projections from the IL. (f) Optogenetics allows for
  not only the targeted manipulation of a specific brain region but also cell-type
  specificity. By injecting a Cre-dependent ChR2 construct (green) into the midbrain
  of TH-Cre rats, light could be used to manipulate only the TH-expressing, or dopamine,
  cells in the midbrain. (g) BOLD activation maps during optogenetic stimulation of
  dopaminergic cells (red) in the midbrain in awake rats, showing robust, ipsilateral
  increases in activity in the dorsal and ventral striatum along with increases in
  other areas. BOLD activity during resting-state opto-fMRI can be correlated with
  behavior outside the scanner. (h) Active and inactive lever presses in rats receiving
  optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic cells in the midbrain. Compared with control
  (YFP) rats (black line), ChR2-expressing rats (blue line) consistently had higher
  levels of active lever presses (compared with inactive lever presses) for midbrain
  light delivery, suggesting that the optogenetic stimulation pattern used during
  opto-fMRI is rewarding. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between
  a rat’s preference for the active lever outside the scanner and the change in BOLD
  activity in the ventral striatum during optogenetic stimulation in the scanner.
