caption: 'Differential expression between the S- and T-type, general Gene Ontology
  pathways.A, volcano plot showing the significantly differential genes (red dots)
  between T and S, top genes shown in red font. B, heatmap showing the expression
  level (in z-scores) in S, T, and NR. Genes are grouped into four classes: () T >
  S or () T < S unique, the differential genes in T versus S but not in T versus NR
  or S versus NR; () T > S shared, the differential genes where expression in T >
  S and in T > NR or S < NR; () T < S shared, the differential genes where expression
  in T < S and in T < NR or S > NR. C, hypergeometric test–based GO enrichment for
  the differential genes defined in (B). GO terms were collected from three categories:
  biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF), cellular components (CC). D,
  GSEA for the differential genes comparing T versus S. The upper barplot shows the
  significantly enriched GO terms in T > S (magenta), while the lower barplot shows
  the significantly enriched GO terms in T < S (blue). The color gradient represents
  the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES). The length of the bars represents the q-value
  in logarithm. The inset shows the GSEA running-sum statistic (green curve), the
  genes overlapping the target gene set (gray whiskers), and the leading-edge hits
  (red dashed line) for the particular pathway: GO:0006412 (translation). GO, gene
  ontology; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; NR, nonresponsive.'
