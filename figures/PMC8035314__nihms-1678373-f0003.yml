figure_title: Signaling via the IR and IGF-1R
caption: Upon stimulation with ligand, receptors undergo trans-autophosphorylation
  and recruit the downstream signaling adaptors SHC and the IRS proteins. Once bound,
  these adaptors are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, creating docking sites for
  the recruitment of signaling effectors. Recruitment of SHC activates the RAS/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway to stimulate growth. Recruitment of the IRS proteins activates
  PI3K and the downstream signaling effectors AKT and mTOR to regulate survival, glucose
  metabolism and protein synthesis.
