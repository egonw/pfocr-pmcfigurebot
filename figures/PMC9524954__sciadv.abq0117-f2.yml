figure_title: MPC inhibition affects glutamine–to–TCA cycle flux in DLBCL cells
caption: '(A) Growth assay of OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCL cells cultured in suspension in
  media supplemented with 2, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, or 0 mM glutamine ± the MPC inhibitor
  UK-5099. Cell concentration is the mean of n = 3 independent biological experiments,
  ± SD. (B) Growth assay of OxPhos- and BCR-DLBCL cells cultured in suspension and
  treated with either vehicle, GLS inhibitor CB-839, or CB-839 with dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate
  (dmKG). Cell concentration is the mean of n = 3 independent biological experiments,
  ± SD. (C) Schematic of l-[U-13C]-glutamine tracing. GOT2, mitochondrial aspartate
  aminotransferase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase. (D) Quantification of the isotopologue
  abundances of M + 5 citrate, M + 4 succinate, M + 4 malate, M + 4 citrate, M + 2
  succinate, and M + 2 malate in DLBCL cells cultured with l-[U-13C]-glutamine ± the
  MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 30 min. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent
  biological experiments, ± SD. (E) Quantification of the isotopologue abundances
  of M + 5 citrate, M + 4 succinate, M + 4 malate, M + 4 citrate, M + 2 succinate,
  and M + 2 malate in DLBCL cells cultured with l-[U-13C]-glutamine ± the MPC inhibitor
  UK-5099 for 2 hours. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent biological
  experiments, ± SD. (F) Quantification of the isotopologue abundances of M + 0 and
  M + 3 alanine and M + 0 and M + 3 lactate in the medium collected from DLBCLs grown
  with d-[U-13C]-glucose ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 4 hours. Isotopologue abundance
  is the mean of n = 3 independent biological experiments, ± SD. Vehicle: Dimethyl
  sulfoxide (DMSO). ns, P > 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
  Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.'
