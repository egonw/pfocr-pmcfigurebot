caption: Expression summary and function enrichment analysis of genes from alfalfa
  root in response to soil compaction. (A) Venn diagram of overlap of total and differentially
  expressed genes detected in each sample. (B) Gene Ontology enrichment results of
  differentially expressed genes (top 10 significantly enriched annotations are displayed).
  (C) KEGG pathway enrichment results of differentially expressed genes. CK, 1.2 g
  cm−3 (bulk density); CP, 1.5 g cm−3.
