caption: 'NCK2 was identified as a target of OIP5 in human SSCs. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering showed the DEGs in human SSC line transfected with control siRNA and
  OIP5 siRNA3. Notes: Red color represented relatively high expression level of genes,
  and blue color indicated relatively low expression level of genes. (B) Volcano plot
  illustrated the DEGs in human SSC line between control siRNA and OIP5 siRNA3. (C)
  qPCR revealed the different expression of OIP5, NCK2, NEDD1, CCND1, SPRY2, and ABCC9.
  (D) Pathway analysis of the DEGs by KEGG. The items with larger bubbles contained
  more DEGs. The bubble color changed from purple-blue-green-red, which indicated
  the smaller the enrichment P value. (E) GO analysis illustrated the top 30 enrichment
  functional terms. (F and G) Western blots showed that NCK2 level was decreased by
  OIP5 siRNA2 and OIP5 siRNA3. * indicated P < 0.05; ** denoted P < 0.01.'
