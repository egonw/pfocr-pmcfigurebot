figure_title: Genes and pathways regulated by miR-638. The signaling pathway regulated
  by miR-638 (p < 0.05; A). Signaling pathways affected by the genes regulated by
  miR-638 (B). The network of targeted genes and related signaling pathways of miR-638
  (C). The expression of VEGFA and CAMK2A. Compared with negative control or inhibitor
  control group, the expression of VEGFA (D; left) and CAMK2A (D; right) in both MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 cells was upregulated in miR-638 transfection group and downregulated
  in miR-638 inhibitor group
