figure_title: The activation of the IGF1/IGF1R-related signaling pathways by GASP1
  in breast cancer cells
caption: a The potential downstream pathways of GASP1 were identified by FunRich.
  b The effect of GASP1 overexpression on the activities of multiple signaling pathways,
  including IGF1/IGF1R1, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK pathways. GAPDH was used as
  a loading control. c The effect of GASP1 knockout on the activities of IGF1/IGF1R1,
  NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK pathways. d Representative tumor sections from GASP1-knockout
  and control mice were subjected to IHC staining with the indicated antibodies. Scale
  bar, 200 µm. Data were presented as mean ± SD. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
article_title: GASP1 enhances malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells and decreases
  their response to paclitaxel by forming a vicious cycle with IGF1/IGF1R signaling
  pathway.
