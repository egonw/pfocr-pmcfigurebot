caption: Galangin reduced 6-OHDA-induced intracellular ROS generation and apoptosis
  in HT22 cells. (A) HT22 cells were treated with galangin in the absence or presence
  of 6-OHDA at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were
  incubated with 5 μM H2DCFDA probe for 30 min and subjected to flow cytometry analysis.
  (B) Bar chart indicates the percentage of HT22 cells with H2DCFDA signals. Bars,
  S.D., ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001. (C) HT22 cells were treated with galangin in the
  absence or presence of 6-OHDA at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. After treatment,
  the cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry using an Annexin V-FITC
  apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. (D) Bar chart
  indicates the apoptosis rate of HT22 cells. Bars, S.D., ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.
  (E) HT22 cells were treated with galangin in the absence or presence of 6-OHDA at
  the indicated concentrations for 24 h. After treatment, cell lysates were then collected
  for the protein detection of Bax, Bcl-2, and β-actin by Western blot. (F) Bar chart
  indicates the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Bars, S.D., ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001. The full-length
  Western blotting images are shown in .
