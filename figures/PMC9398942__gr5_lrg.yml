caption: 'NO and H2S crosstalk. NO, and H2S interact at multiple levels to mutually
  impact production and downstream signaling and create new reaction products. NO
  – enzymatically produced from l-arginine by nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS mediates most of
  its downstream effects through the sGC-cGMP pathway. Superoxide reduces NO production
  by causing NOS uncoupling and consumes NO to form peroxynitrite. NO signaling is
  terminated by PDE5A, which degrades cGMP. H2S is produced enzymatically by CBS,
  CSE, and 3-MST in conjunction with CAT. NO upregulates CSE expression and, in a
  cell-free system, inhibits CBS activity. H2S has a dual effect on eNOS activity
  and expression that may be dependent on the release kinetics of donor molecules,
  concentration, and other factors; it may either inhibit eNOS or increase eNOS activity
  via intracellular Ca2+ release or Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Similar biphasic
  effects are noted upon NF-κB, the transcription factor for iNOS. H2S also reduces
  superoxide production, thereby reducing NO consumption to produce peroxynitrite;
  additionally, H2S is a scavenger of peroxynitrite as well. H2S augments downstream
  signaling of NO by increasing sGC activity and inhibiting PDE5A. NO and H2S may
  also combine to form new species such as RSNO, HNO, and HSNO, which produce different
  effects than either gasotransmitter alone.Abbreviations: 3-MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate
