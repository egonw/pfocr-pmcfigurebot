caption: (a) Volcano plots of DEGs for LUAD patients. The abscissa represents log2FC
  and the ordinate indicates the −log10 (adjusted p value) of the genes. The red and
  green points, respectively, represent the upregulated and downregulated genes with
  the criteria of adjusted p value  < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. (b) Volcano plots of
  DEGs for LUSC patients. (c) The number of target genes related to curcumin from
  seven open-source databases. (d) Venn diagram depicting common target genes between
  LUAD and curcumin. (e) Venn diagram depicting common target genes between LUSC and
  curcumin. (f) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis results of curcumin-LUAD intersection
  genes according to q value. (g) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis results of curcumin-LUSC
  intersection genes according to q value. (h) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identification
  results of curcumin-LUAD intersection genes according to q value. (i) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis identification results of curcumin-LUSC intersection genes according
  to q value.
