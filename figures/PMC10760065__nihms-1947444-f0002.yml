caption: 'Specific invasive phenotype RNA sequencing reveals distinct molecular pathways.
  (A) Schematic of invasive phenotype-based organoids isolation. (B) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of 3 biological replicates based on all ~22,000 expressed genes.
  Samples are colored based on the invasive phenotype (red: non-invasive, blue: collective
  or green: disseminative). (C,E) Hallmark gene set enrichment analysis on z-scores
  between non-invasive and collective invasion (C), non-invasive and disseminative
  invasion (E). Only the Hallmarks with a p-value < 0.05 are represented. (D,F) Heat
  map of z-scores of significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes with a genome
  wide significance cut-off (p-value < 1×10−6) comparing non-invasive to collective
  invasive organoids (295 genes) (D), non-invasive to disseminative organoids (228
  genes) (F). (D’,F’) KEGG pathway analysis from SDE genes comparing non-invasive
  to collective invasive organoids (D’), non-invasive to disseminative organoids (F’).
  Only pathways with a p-value < 0.05 are represented.'
