caption: Results of scRNA-seq data analysis of lupus nephritis (LN). (A) Uniform manifold
  approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of the scRNA-seq data of LN with cell type
  annotations. (B) Heatmap of the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  identified from the bulk transcriptome in each cell cluster from scRNA-seq data
  of LN. (C) ssGSEA scores of each cell cluster in LN for the bulk transcriptome DEGs.
  (D) Heatmap of the cellular signaling pathway of each immune cell cluster in LN
  and normal kidney tissue. (E) Results of the trajectory analysis of macrophages
  in LN, showing the distribution of macrophage subtypes alongside the pseudotime.
  (F) The heatmap of marker genes alongside the evolution of macrophages in LN
article_title: Integrative analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptome data reveal
  the significant role of macrophages in lupus nephritis.
