caption: Compound C Inhibits PI3K-AKT-NFκB axis. (A,B). Gene set enrichment analysis
  showing inhibition of PI3K pathway and the inflammatory response in CC-treated SKOV3
  cells. (C). Western blot showing the effect of CC on PI3K-AKT-mTOR-NFκB pathway
  SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cell lines, with HSP90 as loading control. (D). Western blots showing
  the effect of CC on LPA-induced nuclear localization of p65RelA subunit of NFκB
  in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. Lamin A/C and b-actin were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic
  markers respectively. (E). Immunofluorescence staining of SKOV3 treated with CC
  showing inhibition of nuclear translocation of p65RelA in SKOV3 cells by CC (magnification,
  400×). White arrows indicate the green fluorescence of nuclear translocation of
  p56RelA.
