caption: 'Friedelin abolished the amyloidogenic pathway of Aβ production against scopolamine.
  The immune blot analysis of markers of amyloidogenic pathway i.e., BACE-1 and Aβ
  of control vs. scopolamine and combination treatment of scopolamine and friedelin
  is shown in (a), while the respective histograms are placed at (b,c). The results
  were expressed in arbitrary unit (A.U) and were determined using ImageJ software
  and histogram indicate mean A.U ± SEM. Significance of control vs. scopolamine is
  expressed as #, while * denotes scopolamine vs. scopolamine + friedelin. ** p <
  0.01 and ***, ### p < 0.001.'

  Inhibition of the Activated JNK/NF-κB Signalling Pathway in Scopolamine-Induced
  Mice Model of Neurodegeneration.
