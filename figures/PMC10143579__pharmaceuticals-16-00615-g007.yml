caption: 'PA levels of ALS, FTD, FTD–ALS, EOAD and CONTR participants. PA levels are
  visualized by boxplots clustered according to brain region. White dots represent
  the minimal and maximal outliers. Post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted significance values
  are classified as p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.01 and are indicated by one or two asterisks,
  respectively. Abbreviations: BA22 = Brodmann area 22, ALS = amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis, FTD = frontotemporal dementia, EOAD = early onset Alzheimer’s disease,
  CONTR = control individuals, PA = picolinic acid.'
article_title: Brain Kynurenine Pathway Metabolite Levels May Reflect Extent of Neuroinflammation
