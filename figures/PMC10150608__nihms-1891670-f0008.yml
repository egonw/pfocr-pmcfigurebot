figure_title: Further identification of tissue-resident populations
caption: (a) tSNE plot of tissue-resident immune cells from chow- and KD-fed samples
  merged displaying expression of selected genes. (b) tSNE plot as in S2A showing
  average z-scores of genes in cell cycle pathway (Reactome database). (c) tSNE plot
  of proliferating cells only (cluster 10). Expression of selected markers is displayed.
  For (a-c) expression is based on pooled data from chow and KD samples (each containing
  n=3 pooled biological samples into 1 technical sample for each diet). (d) Violin
  plots of Il1b expression within all cells from each cluster. Expression is pooled
  from chow (n=4 pooled biological samples into 1 technical sample) and KD (n=3 pooled
  biological samples into 1 technical sample) and total number of cells in each cluster
  is indicated on the figure. Overlaid box plots indicate median and 25th–75th percentiles;
  whiskers extend no further than 1.5×IQR from either upper or lower hinge, as described
  in .
