caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction promotes the skeletal muscle atrophy. When mitochondrial
  function is disrupted, ROS production increases, ATP synthesis decreases and other
  pathways lead to the activation of apoptosis pathway in muscle tissue, enhanced
  protein degradation, increased autophagy, muscle fiber breakdown, and eventually
  induce skeletal muscle atrophy. ROS: reactive oxygen species, AIF: apoptosis-inducing
  factor, FoxO3: forkhead box O 3.'
article_title: Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase contributes to skeletal
  muscle health through the control of mitochondrial function.
