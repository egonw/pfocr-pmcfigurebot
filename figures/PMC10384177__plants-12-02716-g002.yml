caption: The phenotype of leaves, seed germination, and root length. (a) The phenotype
  of leaves of Col-0, OE PIA1, and pia1 mutants. (b) The seed germination of Col-0,
  OE PIA1, and pia1 mutants. 100 seeds were germinated and grown on ½ MS plate containing
  ABA, and photographed on the 11th day. (c) Statistics of the seed germination. (d)
  The root length of Col-0, OE PIA1, and pia1 mutants. The seeds were germinated and
  grown on 1/2 MS plates for 7 days, then transferred to the plate containing ABA
  for 4 days, and then we took photos and count the root length. (e) Statistics of
  the root length. Data are means ± SE of three replicates. Significances of differences
  are indicated as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
