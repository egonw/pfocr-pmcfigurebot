caption: ER stress in CTLs was induced by hepatoma cells. (a) After coculturing hepatoma
  cells with CTLL-2 cells, GRP78 protein expression was detected by western blotting.
  (b) ER morphology was detected by electron microscopy (scale bar = 2 μm). Data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns indicates no statistical significance.
