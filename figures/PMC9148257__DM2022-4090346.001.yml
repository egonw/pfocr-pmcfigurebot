caption: Deguelin upregulates PTEN and KLF4 expression in NSCLC cells. (a) The expression
  levels of PTEN and KLF4 in A549 cells induced by deguelin (25 μM) at different times
  compared to controls treated by PBS. (b) The expression levels of PTEN and KLF4
  in PC9 cells induced by deguelin at different times compared to controls treated
  by PBS. β-Actin was used as an internal control. All experiments were repeated at
  least in triplicate.
