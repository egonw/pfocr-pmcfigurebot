caption: Multiple effectors of the Wnt pathway are regulated by APC, Axin, and GSK-3
  independently of β-catenin. (A) In addition to phosphorylating β-catenin, the Axin
  complex, acting through GSK-3, suppresses mTORC1, targets multiple proteins for
  proteosomal degradation, and inhibits YAP/TAZ transcription factors (Hippo pathway).
  APC and GSK-3 also suppress ERK and BMP signaling and regulate mitotic spindle orientation
  (not shown in this figure). (B) Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway causes APC
  to dissociate from the Axin complex, reducing the catalytic activity of GSK-3. The
  phosphorylated C terminus of LRP5/6 also inhibits GSK-3 directly. GSK-3 inhibition
  activates mTORC1, YAP/TAZ, and the Wnt stabilization of protein (Wnt-STOP) pathway,
  in addition to β-catenin stabilization. (C) Oncogenic mutations in APC remove the
  domain required for Axin binding. As truncated APC does not bind to Axin, this mimics
  the dissociation of APC in response to Wnt signaling, thereby reducing GSK-3 activity
  and activating the downstream effectors β-catenin and mTORC1. For additional information
  on YAP/TAZ, see text. (Diagrams made with BioRender).
