caption: PAD4 knockdown alleviates the inflammatory response in LPS-treated HTR8/SVneo
  cells. (A) PAD4 expression was measured by RT-qPCR after transfection with shNC,
  shPAD4#1 or shPAD4#2 in HTR8/SVneo cells. The expression of (B) PAD4 mRNA and (C)
  protein in LPS-stimulated HTR8/SVneo cells transfected with PAD4 shPAD4 was measured
  with RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The concentrations of inflammatory
  factors including (D) IL-6, (E) MCP-1 and (F) IL-12 were examined using ELISA kits.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. PAD4, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; sh, short hairpin; NC, negative
  control; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
