caption: Effect of EVP on phosphorylated MAPKs and the PDGFR signaling pathway in
  PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs. Cells were harvested at the time the expression of each MAPK
  and PDGFR signaling protein was induced. Following treatment with or without EVP
  (0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL), cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB. They were then lysed
  in lysis buffer and Western blotting was performed to determine the expression levels
  of (A) phosphorylated ERK (15 min), (B) phosphorylated p38 (30 min), (C) phosphorylated
  JNK (30 min), (D) phosphorylated Akt (30 min), (E) phosphorylated PLCγ (within 10
  min), and (F) phosphorylated PDGFR (within 5 min). Quantification of normalized
  densities for P-ERK, P-p38, P-JNK, P-Akt, P-PLCγ and P-PDGFR activities is shown.
  The images indicate the relative expression levels and inhibition of phosphorylation
  from three independent experiments.
