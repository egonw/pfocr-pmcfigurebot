caption: 'ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis identify BbOsrR2 target genes. A Identification
  of BbOsrR2 (gene promoter) targets by comparison of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq under the
  normal, H2O2 (4 mM), and menadione (MND, 60 μM)-stressed conditions for 30 min.
  B MEME analysis indicating the likely binding sequence of BbOsrR2. C Partial annotation
  of identified BbOsrR2 gene targets and their expression patterns. D EMSA verification
  of three BbOsrR2 targets: Msg5, a hypothetical protein gene (BBA_06338) and Mcm1
  with indicated BbOsrR2 protein concentrations. The promoter region of each target
  harboring mutated binding motif was used as the scrambled DNA sequence control (Mutated
  promoter) as detailed in the “” section. E Model of BbOsrR2 regulation of the Fus3-MAP
  kinase pathway via (negative) targeting of Msg5 and Mcm1, affecting expression of
  the Ste4, Fus3, and Cdc28 genes. Upregulated genes in the ΔBbOsrR2 mutant are shadowed
  in red'
