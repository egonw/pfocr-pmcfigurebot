caption: 'The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathways of DEGs in the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery
  (DAVID). (A) GO and KEGG pathway analysis for up-regulated DEGs. (B) GO and KEGG
  pathway analysis for down-regulated DEGs. The GO term and KEGG pathways were ranked
  by gene counts. Top 5 GO terms and KEGG pathways were filtered according to gene
  counts. Gene counts: the number of DEGs enriched genes enriched in each term. Gene
  Ratio: the ratio of the number of enriched DEGs in each term to the total number
  of DEGs.'
