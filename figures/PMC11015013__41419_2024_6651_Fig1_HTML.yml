figure_title: RUVBL1 expression is comparatively high in the radiation breast-tumor
  tissue
caption: 'A FVB-TgN (MMTV-PyMT) transgenic female mice were irradiated when their
  tumors reached 200 mm3. Every 2 days, 3 Gy each time. B The irradiated mice were
  dissected and the tumors were photographed and compared at the end of the experiment.
  C Tumor growth was monitored every 2 days for 5 times, and the volume was recorded
  till the experiment ended (n = 7 mice). D Heatmaps showing the 348 differentially
  expressed proteins in irradiated and non-irradiated tumor tissue. E Volcano plot
  comparing control and irradiated tumor tissue. F Enrichment of differentially expressed
  proteins in signaling pathways is portrayed as a bar chart. Y-axis represents pathways,
  and the X-axis represents rich factor. G Heatmap of DNA repair pathway. H Immunohistochemical
  (IHC) for RUVBL1 in tumor tissues (×10). Scale bars: 100 μm. I Western blot for
  RUVBL1 and β-actin in tumor tissues. Data presented as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, statistical
  differences were assessed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test in (C). (**p < 0.01).'
article_title: RUVBL1 ubiquitination by DTL promotes RUVBL1/2-β-catenin-mediated transcriptional
  regulation of NHEJ pathway and enhances radiation resistance in breast cancer.
