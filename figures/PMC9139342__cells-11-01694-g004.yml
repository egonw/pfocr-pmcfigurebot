caption: Immunostaining and expression of VEGFR-2 and NP-1 in NSCLC cell lines. Immunofluorescent
  images showing modulation in EGFR-TKI resistance-related proteins in (A) H2170-P/ER,
  (B) H358-P/ER, and (C) H1975 and H3255 cells. For the analysis, 2 Ã— 104 cells per
  well were plated in an 8-well chamber slide, fixed, permeabilized, and probed with
  anti-VEGFR-2 and anti-NP-1 primary antibodies and a DyLight 488 conjugated secondary
  antibody for immunostaining. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and cells were visualized
  using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. The mean fluorescent intensities
  of VEGFR-2 and NP-1 receptors were graphically represented for (D) H2170-ER cells
  as compared to parental cells, (E) H358-ER cells as compared to H358-P cells, and
  (F) H1975 double-mutants (T790M and L858R) as compared to H3255 single-mutant (L858R)
  cells. Fluorescence quantifications were performed using Olympus Fluoview image
  analysis software, and mean fluorescent intensities are graphically depicted. Statistical
  analyses demonstrated that the results were statistically significant (p < 0.05)
  by way of two-tailed t-test analyses. One asterisk (*) denotes the statistical significance
  of data concerning NP-1, whereas two asterisks (**) denote the statistical significance
  of data concerning VEGFR-2.
