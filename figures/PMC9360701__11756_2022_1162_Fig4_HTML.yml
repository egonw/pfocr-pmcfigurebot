caption: 'Possible mechanism of minocycline: modulation of MMP pathway during stroke.
  Minocycline may provide protective effects against COVID-19-induced stroke, neurodegeneration,
  and organ damage. COVID-19-induced hypoxia/ischemia likely causes activation of
  HIF, which causes activation of MMP-2. This coronavirus-induced hypoxia/ischemia
  can cause activation of cytokines such as TNF-α and NF-κB, which leads to activation
  of MMP-9. Both MMP-2 and − 9 cause degradation of the ECM, which leads to BBB disruption
  and degeneration of critical organ tissue. Minocycline is a good candidate for treating
  COVID-19-induced stroke due to its inhibitory effect on the MMP signaling pathway,
  neurodegeneration, and organ damage. Abbreviations: ECM, extracellular matrix'
