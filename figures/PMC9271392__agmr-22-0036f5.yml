caption: Mechanism of sclerostin as inhibitor of Wnt3a signaling in muscle via Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway.,,,,) Wnt3a may have a role in bone-muscle crosstalk via the canonical
  pathway (Wnt/β-catenin signaling). Sclerostin was revealed to inhibit Wnt3a-mediated
  crosstalk, resulting in reduction of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibition
  of satellite cell development. Wnt3a also induces MyoD and Myogenin, both of them
  are required for myogenesis. Myf5, myogenic factor 5; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Dsh,
  disheveled; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor.
