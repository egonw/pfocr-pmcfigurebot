caption: The effect of ATF6 pathway activation on PDCoV replication. (A–D) The effect
  of ATF6 pathway inhibitor AEBSF on PDCoV replication. LLC-PK1 cells were treated
  with the indicated concentration of AEBSF (50 µM) and then infected with PDCoV for
  12 h as described in the Materials and methods, before being used in quantitative
  real-time RT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence assay, or TCID50 analysis for
  determining the relative levels of GRP78 and GRP94 mRNA (A), viral genomic RNA (B),
  N protein expression (B, C), and virus titer (D). (E, F) The effect of ATF6 or GRP78
  knockdown on PDCoV replication. LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with siRNA against
  ATF6 (E) or GRP78 (F) or with negative control siRNA for 12 h, and then infected
  with PDCoV for 12 h. Cell samples were harvested and subjected to quantitative real-time
  RT-PCR and western blot assay for assessing viral replication. The presented results
  are the means and standard deviations of data from three independent experiments.
