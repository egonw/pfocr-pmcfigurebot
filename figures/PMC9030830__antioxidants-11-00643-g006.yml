caption: 'Rh1 inhibits VSMC migration promoted by Ang II via the ERK1/2/p90RSK signaling
  pathway. (A–C) The cells were pretreated with 50 µM Rh1 in the presence or absence
  of 20 µM FMK or 10 µM U0126 for 3 h, before undergoing stimulation with Ang II (100
  nM) for 24 h. (A,B) The wound-healing assay was applied to examine the cell migration.
  The red lines indicate a clear zone after scratching (0 h). (B) The quantification
  of cell migration was carried out by Image J software. (C) Western blot analysis
  was used to analyze the levels of the indicated proteins in the cells. (D,E) RASMCs
  were preincubated with 50 µM Rh1 in the presence or absence of 20 µM FMK or 10 µM
  U0126 for 1 h, before 12 h of exposure to 100 nM Ang II. The mRNA levels of MMP2
  and MMP9 were evaluated using qPCR analysis. (B,D,E) Results are presented as means
  ± SEM (n = 4), ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 compared with the control. ## p < 0.01
  and ### p < 0.001 compared with the Ang II-treated sample.'
