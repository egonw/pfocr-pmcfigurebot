caption: Gene clustering and functional analyses. (A) The consensus CDF curve; (B)
  the CDF delta area curve, which represents the area difference between the area
  of CDF under ki and horizontal axis and CDF under ki + 1 and horizontal axis; (C)
  the consensus cluster under k=5; (D) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes
  in clusters 1â€“3. k represents the number of gene clusters. CDF, cumulative distribution
