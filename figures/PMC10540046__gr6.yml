caption: 'Deacetylase HDAC mediates Raptor acetylation and mTORC1 pathway regulation.A,
  immunofluorescence and Western blotting of the global protein lysine acetylation
  in CN and HDAC inhibitor (trichostatin A [TSA]: 10 μM) treated ZFL cells. Scale
  bars represent 5 μm. N = 3. B, the effects of deacetylase SIRT inhibition (nicotinamide
  [NAM]: 0, 1, and 5 μM) on global protein lysine acetylation in ZFL cells. N = 3.
  C, Raptor acetylation in CN- and TSA-treated ZFL cells. N = 3. D, Raptor acetylation
  in CN- and NAM- (5 μM) treated ZFL cells. N = 3. E, mTORC1 activity (p-mTORSer2448,
  p-S6kThr389, and p-S6Ser235/236) in CN- and TSA-treated ZFL cells. N = 3. F, the
  effects of mitochondrial FAO inhibition (MD treatment) on mRNA expression levels
  of class IIa HDAC-related genes in ZFL cells. N = 3. Data represent mean ± SD. ∗p <
  0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. CN, control; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MD, mildronate; mTORC1,
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; SIRT, sirtuin deacetylase; ZFL, zebrafish
  liver.'
