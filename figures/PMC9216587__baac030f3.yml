caption: A case study on BRCA1 in breast cancer. Using ‘Search SL by disease’, the
  SL genes associated with the disease will be shown. BRCA1 is a gene that has SL
  partners and is downregulated in breast cancer. Click the ‘Search SL’ button, and
  it shows that PARP2 is an SL partner of BRCA1 with a high confidence score (0.87).
  Inspecting this pair of SL genes, we notice that BRCA1 and PARP2 are both associated
  with the ‘ovarian cancer’ and ‘breast cancer’ diseases, and BRCA1 participates in
  the ‘DNA Damage Response’ pathway. The infobox at the upper right corner shows the
  annotations of the SL. The synthetic lethal relationship between BRCA1 and PARP2
  has been reported in the literature on human cancer and cell lines including A549,
  PC3 and MDA468. The result that breast cancer downregulates BRCA1 and PARP2 is an
  SL partner of BRCA1 indicates that PARP2 is a drug target for breast cancer. Rucaparib,
  Talazoparib, Niraparib and Olaparib all bind with PARP2. Using ‘Search SL by compound’,
  we also identify PARP2 as a potential drug target of Rucaparib, Talazoparib, Niraparib
  and Olaparib.
