caption: Metabolic patterns, cancer hallmarks, and immune infiltration profiles of
  CRGs across cancer types(A) Spearman correlation of 16 CRGs with 10 metabolic pathway
  enrichment scores calculated by the ssGSEA method across 33 TCGA cancer types. Only
  p values <0.05 are shown. Red indicates a positive correlation, while blue indicates
  a negative correlation.(B) Spearman correlations of 16 CRGs with 8 cancer hallmark
  enrichment scores calculated by the ssGSEA method across 33 TCGA cancer types. Only
  p values <0.05 are shown. Purple indicates a positive correlation, while green indicates
  a negative correlation.(C) The cancer hallmarks and tumor immune microenvironment
  (TIME) regulatory landscape of each CRG by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based
  on the transcriptomes of the two tumor groups with the top and bottom 30% of each
  CRG.(D) Network diagram demonstrating the correlation between CRGs and TIME cells.
  Red represents a positive correlation, and blue represents a negative correlation.
  The size of the nodes corresponds to the number of links.
