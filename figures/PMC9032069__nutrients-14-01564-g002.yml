caption: Ginsenoside Rh4 reverses EMT in vitro. (A) Western blot. Quantification plots
  are shown below. (B) qRT-PCR assay. β-actin was used as an endogenous reference.
  (C) IF assay. E-cadherin (red) and N-cadherin (green) are presented. DAPI (blue)
  was used to mark the cell nuclei. Scale bars = 50 µm. Statistics are exhibited as
  the mean ± SD of triplicate independent experiments; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001.
