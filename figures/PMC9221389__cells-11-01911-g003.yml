caption: Cluster analysis of scRNA-seq data. (A) The classification of cardiac CD45+
  total leukocytes from day 0 to day 7, using t-distributed random neighbor embedding,
  and coloring by clustering after manual annotation. Blue (macrophages), red (neutrophils),
  gray (unknown). (B) The proportion of neutrophils, macrophages and unknown clusters
  among the total number of cells at each time point. (C) Violin diagram of the expression
  of S100a8 and S100a9 in various types of cells at each time point. (D) S100a8 and
  S100a9 expression distribution map at each time point.
article_title: Integrated Analysis Reveals S100a8/a9 Regulates Autophagy and Apoptosis
  through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway in the Early Stage of Myocardial
  Infarction.
