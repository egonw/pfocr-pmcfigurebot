caption: 'Norepinephrine-induced activation of FAK is mediated by the β2AR-cAMP-PKA
  pathway. a Western blot analysis of FAK phosphorylation in PC-3 cells treated with
  norepinephrine for different times. b Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells treated
  with 10 µM norepinephrine, 10 µM isoproterenol for 10 min and 10 µM propranolol
  2 h before 10 µM norepinephrine treatment for 10 min in the presence of propranolol.
  c Immunofluorescence staining of pY397 FAK and F-actin treated with 10 µM norepinephrine
  for 18 h and 10 µM propranolol, 10 µM atenolol or 10 µM ICI118 551 2 h before 10
  µM norepinephrine treatment for 18 h in the presence of propranolol, atenolol or
  ICI118 551 respectively. Bar: 5 µm. d Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells treated
  with 10 µM norepinephrine for 10 min, or 10 µM atenolol or 10 µM ICI118 551 2 h
  before 10 µM norepinephrine treatment in the presence of atenolol or ICI118,551
  respectively. e Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells treated with 10 µM forskolin
  for 10 min, or treated with 10 µM H-89 2 h before 10 µM norepinephrine treatment
  in the presence of H-89. The experiments were performed at least three times independently'
