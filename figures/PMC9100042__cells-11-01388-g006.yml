caption: The proteasome is a major contributor to the acute oxidative stress response
  in differentiating lt-NES cells and regulates NRF2 pathway activation. (A) Measurement
  of the 20S proteasome activity in proliferating and differentiated lt-NES cells.
  The proteasomal substrate dye LLVY-R110 was added to the cells together with IC20
  TBHP concentrations, and fluorescence was measured after 1 h and 8 h. Proteasomal
  activity is presented as percentage increase in the fluorescence signal between
  8 h and the baseline value at 1 h (∆t-t1h). Data are presented as means ± SEM (n
  = 4 per treatment and differentiation time point, * p < 0.05, Student’s t-test).
  (B) ATPlite assay of lt-NES cells differentiated for 10 and 12 weeks treated with
  TBHP with or without MG132 pre-treatment, showing that proteasomal impairment leads
  to increased susceptibility to acute oxidative stress. Cells were pre-treated with
  MG132 followed by a 24 h TBHP treatment. Cell viability was assessed at the end
  of the treatment by ATPlite assay. Results are presented as percentages relative
  to untreated cells (equal to 100%). Data are presented as means ± SEM (n = 5, consisting
  of at least 3 technical replicates per treatment condition; data from the control
  curve are the same as shown in D). Significant difference between dose–response
  curves for TBHP treatment with or without MG132 was confirmed by two-way ANOVA (p
  < 0.0001). (C) Western blot analysis of NRF2 and KEAP1 protein levels across lt-NES
  differentiation upon proteasomal inhibition (by MG132) for 17 h. (D) NRF2 pathway
  downstream target gene expression under OS induction upon inhibition of the proteasome
  (MG132). lt-NES cells were differentiated for 10 weeks, pre-treated with MG132 for
  17 h and subsequently treated with TBHP for 8 h. Cells were treated with TBHP only
  for 8 h as a control treatment. Expression of the NRF2 downstream target genes NQO1
  and TXNRD1 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Results are presented in comparison to MG132
  pre-treatment control (equal to 1). Data are normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and
  presented as means ± SEM (n = 4 per treatment condition). Statistically significant
  difference between means was assessed by unpaired Student’s t-test for NQO1 (p =
  0.0128) and TXNRD1 (p = 0.0016) gene expression (* p < 0.05).
