caption: Arginine metabolism in response to N sources. (A) Arginine metabolic pathway.
  (B) Relative expression level of genes in arginine metabolism. (C) Relative levels
  of intermediate metabolites in arginine metabolism. The data were normalized to
  these in the NN treatment. Data were represented by means ± SD (n = 3). Different
  letters on bars indicate significant differences at p < 0.05 level according to
  one-way ANOVA combined with Duncan’s multiple range method. NN—nitrate nitrogen;
  AN—ammonium nitrogen; UN—urea nitrogen; GN—glycine nitrogen.
