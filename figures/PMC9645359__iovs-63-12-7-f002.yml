caption: 'PGB reduced mitochondria-associated RGC apoptosis induced by RIR injury.
  (A) PGB pretreatment decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax but increased
  Bcl-2 expression, and the most significant improvement was observed at 30 mg/kg.
  (B) PGB pretreatment reversed the elevation of cleaved caspase 3/pro-caspase 3 elicited
  by RIR, and the most significant improvement was observed at 30 mg/kg. (C) PGB (30
  mg/kg) pretreatment inhibited ROS generation. (D) RIR injury induced disintegrated
  cristae and increased matrix density in mitochondria. PGB pretreatment improved
  the structure of mitochondria following RIR; mitochondria are indicated by the yellow
  arrow (n = 6; 25,000×). Scale bars: 500 nm. *P  < 0.05 versus control group; **P 
  < 0.05 versus NaCl + RIR group; ***P < 0.05 versus 30-mg/kg PGB + RIR group.'
