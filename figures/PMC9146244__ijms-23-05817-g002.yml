caption: Viruses interfere with the normal signaling pathways of neurotrophins. The
  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can promote the increment of both proBDNF and
  mature BDNF in microglial cells. Additionally, HIV can downregulate the CREB pathway,
  decreasing the levels of BDNF and causing neuronal impairment. Finally, HIV can
  interfere with the MAPK/ERK pathway, decreasing the NGF levels and inducing neuronal
  death. The influenza virus (IV) lowers both BDNF and NGF levels. However, the pathway
  that alters to cause this effect has not been described. Regarding Epstein Barr
  virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), their viral latency is induced by
  activating the PI3-K pathway activated by the NGF/TrkA association. Lastly, in the
  case of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is known that they increase the levels of NGF and
  its high-affinity receptor TrkA. However, the effect that this interaction has remains
  unknown.
