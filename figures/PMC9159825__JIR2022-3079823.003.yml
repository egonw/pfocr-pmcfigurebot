caption: Deoxyschizandrin can regulate the expression of ALOX5 in BC cell. (a) The
  chemical structure of Deoxyschizandrin. (b) qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression
  levels of ALOX5 in HT1376 and J82 cells treated with Deoxyschizandrin or negative
  control. (c and d) Western blot analysis of protein expression levels of ALOX5 in
  HT1376 and J82 cells treated with Deoxyschizandrin or negative control. Data represent
  mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 compared with negative control.
