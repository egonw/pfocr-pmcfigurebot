caption: Effect of cold stress on the phenylpropanoid pathway. (A) Cold-induced differentially
  expressed genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. (B) The levels of p-coumaric,
  ferulic, and sinapic acids were assessed using HPLC. The data are presented as mean
  ± SE of five independent experiments. Values with different letters are significantly
  different, according to Duncan’s multiple range test. C0, plants grown at 20 °C
  (control plants); C1d and C3d, plants treated cold stress (10 °C) for 1 day and
  3 days, respectively. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; COMT,
  caffeate/5-hydroxyferulate 3-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; SCT, sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase;
  CHR, chalcone reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone
  3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyl/glucosyl transferase.
