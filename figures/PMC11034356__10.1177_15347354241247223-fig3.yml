caption: 'KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of significant miRNA targets. (A) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis revealed overrepresented pathways associated with cancer with
  FDR P value <.05. The bubble plot shows enrichment scores [âˆ’log10 (P value), x-axis]
  of the significantly enriched pathways (y-axis). (B) Top 10 ranked GO terms of 3
  categories (BP: biology process; CC: cell component; MF: molecular function) based
  on P values.'
