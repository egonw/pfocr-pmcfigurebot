caption: Overview of differentially expressed genes and top 30 enriched Reactome signaling
  pathways in the target tissues of the four diseases following GSEA analysis(A–D)
  (A) The number of genes differentially expressed in type 1 diabetes (T1D), type
  2 diabetes (T2D), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The numbers
  above the bars represent the genes with an adjusted p-value <0.05. GSEA of T1D (B),
  T2D (C), MS (D), and AD (E) target tissues based on the Reactome database. Bars
  in red and blue represent enrichment or inhibition of pathways, respectively. The
  x-axis shows the normalized enrichment score (NES) of the fGSEA analysis, and the
  y-axis shows enriched pathways with an adjusted p-value <0.05. The full name of
  pathway “Immunoregulatory interactions” in (B, D and E) is “Immunoregulatory interactions
  between a lymphoid and a non-lymphoid cell”; “Runx1 regulates transcription of genes”
  in A is “Runx1 regulates transcription of genes involved in differentiation of HSCS”;
  “Runx1 regulates genes involved in megakaryocyte differentiation” in A is “Runx1
  regulates genes involved in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet function”;
  “Gene and protein expression by JAK stat signaling ” in B is “Gene and protein expression
  by JAK stat signaling after interleukin-2 stimulation”; “Respiratory electron transport
  ATP synthesis” in D is “Respiratory electron transport ATP synthesis and heat production”
  (see also ).
