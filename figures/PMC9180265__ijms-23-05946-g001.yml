caption: BPH infestation activates the CK pathway in rice. (A,B) qRT-PCR analysis
  of transcript levels of CK metabolic genes OsIPTs and OsCKXs in BPH-infested and
  non-infested rice seedlings. The expression levels of genes in non-infested rice
  seedlings were set as 1. Ubiquitin (Os03g0234350) was used as an internal reference.
  (C) Levels of endogenous CKs in BPH-infested and non-infested rice seedlings measured
  by nano-LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS. tZ, trans-zeatin; cZ, cis-zeatin; iP, isopentenyladenine;
  tZR, cis-zeatin riboside; cZR, cis-zeatin riboside; iPR, isopentenyladenine riboside.
  (D,E) Transcript levels of type-B CK response regulators, OsORRs, and type-A CK
  response regulators, OsRRs. Sheaths from ten-day-old seedlings of Zhonghua11 were
  collected at 24 h after BPH feeding for qRT-PCR analysis and CK quantification.
  N.D indicates undetected. Data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3. Statistical differences
  were determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
