caption: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway in REM sleep deprivation
  with and without lithium treatment. The REM sleep-deprived hearts (n = 5) had greater
  expression levels of TGF-β, phosphorylated Smad 2/3, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
  compared with the control (n = 5) and lithium-treated REM sleep-deprived (n = 5)
  hearts. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
