caption: Gene and activated signaling pathway profiles of CECs that matured in the
  presence of TGF-β2. (A) Volcano plot of P values presented as log2 of linear expression
  for all genes. (B) Principal component analysis. Blue dots represent the four populations
  in the CTRL condition, and pink dots represent the four populations that matured
  with TGF-β2. (C) Functional analysis where each dot represents a cellular function.
  Dot colors represent the strength of the correlation (e.g., red means that gene
  expression strongly correlates with the function). Links between the dots represent
  close relations between the functions.
