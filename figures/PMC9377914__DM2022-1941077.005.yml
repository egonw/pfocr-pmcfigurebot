caption: The impact of DDTC treatment on A2780 xenograft tumor growth in vivo. (a)
  Schedule of tumor implantation and injection of PEG-400 or DDTC for cell depletion
  in mice. (b) Xenograft tumor volume was monitored over time in the two treatment
  groups. Tumors were weighed in the PEG-400 and DDTC groups. (c and d) DDTC treatment
  suppressed A2780 xenograft tumor growth following implantation into nude mice (n
  = 6). ∗∗P < 0.01.
