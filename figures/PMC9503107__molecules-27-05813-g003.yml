caption: 'CNP extract treatment suppressed glutamate-induced ROS in HT22 cells. The
  cells were pretreated with CNP extract (0.1–50 µg/mL) or resveratrol (5 µM) for
  24 h, followed by 5 mM glutamate 18 h. After this, the cells were incubated with
  10 mM DCFH2-DA for 45 min at 37 °C. (a) The fluorescence intensity was measured
  via flow cytometry. (b) The histogram represents the relative ROS level of each
  treatment. Data are expressed as the relative ROS level compared to the non-treated
  control. The values are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). Note: # p < 0.05 versus
  cell control, *** p < 0.001 versus 5 mM glutamate-treated cells.'
