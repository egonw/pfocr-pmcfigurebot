caption: 'Ulinastatin (UTI) enhanced macrophage efferocytosis. (A) Effect of UTI on
  RAW264.7 cell phagocytosis and apoptosis of HL60 cell. Representative fluorescence
  image of HL60 phagocytotic apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Scale: 100 μm; (B) phagocytic
  index based on fluorescence image. (C) UTI enhanced the ability of alveolar macrophages
  to phagocytose apoptotic PMNs. Representative images of PMNs from alveolar macrophage
  phagocytic apoptosis, scale:100 μm; (D) phagocytic index based on representative
  images. Arrows indicate macrophages containing apoptotic bodies. Data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation, one‐way ANOVA, n = 3. *P < 0.05 vs. CON Group or 0 U·mL−1
  UTI group. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
