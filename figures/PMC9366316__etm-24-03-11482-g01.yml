caption: Rg1 inhibits the apoptosis of ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. (A) TUNEL assay was
  used to detect the apoptosis of ox-LDL-induced HUVECs treated by Rg1 (magnification,
  x200). (B) Quantified proportion of apoptotic cells. (C) Western blot analysis was
  performed to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial
  cell; Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1.
article_title: Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates apoptosis, senescence and oxidative stress
  in ox-LDL-induced vascular endothelial cells via the AMPK/SIRT3/p53 signaling pathway.
