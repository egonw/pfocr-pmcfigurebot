caption: ER−localized SUCNR1 interacts with the PGE synthesis pathway. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation
  of cPLA2 or COX-2 with the endogenous SUCNR1 in whole-cell or ER fraction from RGC-5
  treated (+) or not (−) with 100 μM succinate. Immunoprecipitation was performed
  with an antibody specific to SUCNR1, and is shown as IP loading control. COX-2 and
  cPLA2 coIP signals increased upon succinate stimulation. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation
  of COX-2 with SUCNR1-myc expressed in HEK 293T cells. IP was conducted with an anti-myc
  antibody, and the presence of SUCNR1 and COX-2 in precipitates was assessed using
  the corresponding antibodies. Signal from wild-type and mutant SUCNR1 are indicated
  by grey and black arrows, respectively. COX-2 signal was strongest in lysates from
  cells expressing the fully glycosylated, wild-type SUCNR1. (C) Succinate stimulation
  of isolated ER from RGC-5 led to the production of PGE2. N = 6 * p < 0.05. (D) RGC-5
  ER fractions were treated or not with 100 μM succinate for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently,
  isolated nuclei from RGC-5 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the corresponding
  ER fractions in the presence or absence of EP4 antagonist L-161,982, after which
  Vegfa expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. N = 4 (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (C,D)
  * and ** p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, vs. comparative values.
