caption: Global changes in melanoma cells transcriptome following the knockdown (KD)
  of CCT3. (A) Hierarchical cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes with
  fold change of > 2.0. Row and column represent gene and experimental cells, respectively.
  Upregulated and downregulated genes are shown in red and green, respectively. (B)
  Signaling enrichment analysis of CCT3-downregulated classical signaling pathways
  based on IPA. Differential data are presented as z-scores (based on Fold change).
  (C) The expression trends of molecules in cyclins and cell cycle regulation pathway
  (based on IPA). Red and green represent upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively.
  (D) Knowledge-based interaction network of CCT3 targets after comparing the CCT3-KD
  and the shCtrl cells. The network was built on the basis of the CCT3 interactome
  of microarray data with a 1.5-fold change cutoff. The intensity of the node color
  indicates the degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green). Light colors
  represent less significant p values.
