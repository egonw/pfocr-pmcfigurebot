caption: Light−mediated signaling network in regulating seed germination. Under Far−Red
  light, PhyA Pr in the cytoplasm converts into its active form (PhyA Pfr) and translocates
  to the nucleus, stimulating the degradation of COP1/SPA1 (constitutive photomorphogenic
  protein 1, suppressor of PhyA−105), causing the accumulation of HY5 or by facilitating
  the degradation of PIFs to promote photomorphogenesis. Under red light, PhyB is
  activated and converts to its active Pfr form, moves to the nucleus, and interacts
  with SPA1, preventing the formation of the COP1/SPA complex, resulting in stabilization
  of HY5 and up−regulates the expression of photomorphogenic genes or by mediating
  PIFs protein levels. The active PhyB can be reversed to the inactive form by irradiating
  with low red/far−red lights. Under blue light, CRYs also regulate photomorphogenesis
  through the COP1, SPA, and HY5 pathway. Under UV light, cytoplasmic UVR8 senses
  the light and binds with COP1, moves to the nucleus then stabilizes the HY5 to promote
  photomorphogenesis.
