figure_title: DSI is abolished in Syn-tKO mice
caption: 'a, Schematic of DSI experiments. Top, whole-cell recordings from SPNs during
  induction of DSI; bottom, DSI induction pathway engaged with depolarization (depol)
  (0 mV). b, DSI in WT mice is blocked by AM251 (10 µM); top, representative WT recorded
  trace. c, DSI is abolished in Syn-tKO mice; top, representative Syn-tKO recorded
  trace. d, Summary of DSI for WT mice (n = 17 cells, 5 mice, pre-depol: 95.64 ± 5.01%,
  post-depol: 59.91 ± 5.28%, recovery: 93.51 ± 7.20%, P = 5 × 10−4, P = 1.6 × 10−3).
  e, Summary of DSI for Syn-tKO mice (n = 16 cells, 6 mice, pre-depol: 97.25 ± 3.66%,
  post-depol: 95.70 ± 4.54%, recovery: 107.59 ± 5.20%, P = 0.959, P = 0.148). f, Schematic
  of DSI experiments in CA1 of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. g,i, Summary of
  DSI in WT mice (n = 10 cells, 4 mice; pre-depol: 101.50 ± 2.18%; post-depol: 68.26 ± 5.85%;
  recovery: 96.77 ± 4.36%; P = 3.9 × 10−3, P = 3.9 × 10−3). h,j, Summary of DSI in
  Syn-tKO (n = 10 cells, 4 mice; pre-depol: 97.24 ± 2.08%; post-depol: 93.70 ± 3.94%;
  recovery: 94.73 ± 2.72%; P = 0.625, P = 0.846). Data are mean ± s.e.m. d,e,i,j,
  Box plots are depicted as mean (center), first/third quartiles (lower/upper box
  limits) and minima/maxima (bottom/top whiskers). Statistical significance was assessed
  by two-sided tests, including Wilcoxon signed tests (d,e,i,j) (***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01;
  NS, not significant). Rec, recovery.'
