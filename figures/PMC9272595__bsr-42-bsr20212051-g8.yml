figure_title: Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase pathway with its downstream signaling
  pathways and small molecule inhibitors targeting different proteins of the network
caption: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) plays a significant role in cellular proliferation.
  MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways are two key downstream pathways of RTK. Targeting
  these pathways has remained a successful approach to cause the antitumor effect.
  Small molecule inhibitors have been widely used for targeting different components
  of such pathways. Several small molecule inhibitors targeting different proteins
  of RTK signaling pathways are depicted in this diagram.
