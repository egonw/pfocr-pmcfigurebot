caption: 'Effects of RS treatment and interference with MALAT1 on the proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and apoptosis of GC cells. (A) The level of MALAT1 was measured
  by qRT-PCR; (B) cell proliferation activity was measured by the CCK-8 method; (C)
  cell migration ability was measured by the scratch test. The cell migration width
  was observed under an inverted microscope with the original magnification of 50
  times; (D) the invasion ability of cells was detected by transwell. The number of
  transmembrane cells stained with crystal violet was observed under an inverted microscope,
  and the original magnification was 100 times; (E) apoptosis was measured by flow
  cytometry. Compared to the control or si-NC groups, ***P<0.001; compared to the
  si-MALAT1 group, #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001. RS, resveratrol; NC, normal control;
  MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; GC, gastric cancer;
  CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit 8; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.'
