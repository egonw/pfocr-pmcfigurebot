caption: Ado production in co-cultures of NSCLC CSC spheres and bone cells. Representative
  images of NSCLC CSC spheres co-cultured with OBs (A) and OCs (B) are shown (magnification
  20×). The graphs show the quantification of Ado production expressed as mean area
  % of the peaks ± SD, in the different culture settings (C–E). The differences in
  Ado production among the three types of CSC spheres, OBs, and OCs was analyzed by
  one-way Anova.
