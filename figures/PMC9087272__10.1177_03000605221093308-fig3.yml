caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) induced apoptosis in two gastric
  cancer cell lines in vitro. (a) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with a range
  of concentrations of PL for 48 h and then stained with annexin V/propidium iodide
  (PI) for the flow cytometric analysis of the levels of apoptosis; (b) the proportion
  of cells that were apoptotic after treatment with PL. Data presented as mean ± SD;
  (c) AGS and KATO III cells were treated with a range of concentrations of VC for
  48 h and then stained with annexin V/PI for the flow cytometric analysis of the
  levels of apoptosis; (d) the proportion of cells that were apoptotic after treatment
  with VC. Data presented as mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 compared
  with the control group (treated with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide); analysis of
  variance. The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.'
