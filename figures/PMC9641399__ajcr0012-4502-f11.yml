caption: Overexpression of β-catenin, integrin β1, and FAK enhanced Wnt/β-catenin
  and integrin β1/FAK signaling pathways. The activation of integrin β1/FAK and Wnt/β-catenin
  pathways, and the expression of their downstream signaling molecules in HCT-8 cells
  transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-β-catenin (A) or pcDNA3.1(+)-integrin β1
  (B), or pcDNA3.1(+)-FAK (C), and then treated with 6 μM IVM and/or 25 nM VCR for
  48 h were determined by Western blotting analysis using GAPDH as the internal control
  of whole cell lysate, and histone H3 and β-tubulin as the internal controls for
  nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Cells transfected with empty vector
  pcDNA3.1(+) (mock) served as control. The blots shown were representative of two
  independent experiments.
