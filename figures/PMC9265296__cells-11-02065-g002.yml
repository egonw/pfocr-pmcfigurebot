caption: Role of Hippo/YAP pathway in cardiac fibrosis and repair. Activation of YAP/TAZ
  in fibroblasts and macrophages plays a crucial role in driving cardiac fibrosis
  after MI or AngII-induced injury. Fibroblast-specific loss of Yap/Taz or loss of
  only Yap improves cardiac outcome and reduces fibrotic response in infarcted hearts
  post-injury. Genetic ablation of Yap/Taz in fibroblasts blocks the proliferation
  of fibroblasts and their differentiation into pathologic myofibroblasts and disrupts
  macrophage-mediated inflammatory signature. In contrast, fibroblast-specific inactivation
  of upstream Hippo kinases Lats1/2 aggravates fibrotic response post-MI. Like fibroblasts,
  conditional ablation of Yap/Taz in macrophages leads to impairment of macrophage-mediated
  inflammatory response and thereby reduces cardiac fibrosis, resulting in improved
  cardiac function and hypertrophy post-MI. Consistently, cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation
  of Hippo kinase Sav reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, which
  causes improved cardiac function post-MI. Likewise, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion
  of Rassf1A reduces TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis with improved cardiac
  function. Epicardium-specific deficiency of Yap/Taz reduces the infiltration of
  T-regulatory cells (a subclass of adaptive immune cells) while increasing the recruitment
  of macrophages (a subclass of innate immune cells) in the myocardium, which promotes
  pericardial inflammation and ventricular fibrosis after MI-injury that subsequently
  leads to cardiomyopathy and death.
