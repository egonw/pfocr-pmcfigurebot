caption: 'Analysis of U87 and Hs5 cell motility (μm/s) and percentage of motility
  inhibition (%) in co-culture treated with graphene (GN) and reduced graphene oxide
  (rGO). Statistical significance between the control and treated cells is indicated
  by an asterisk and was assessed using Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. Differences
  with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. One asterisk (*) indicates
  p < 0.05, three asterisk (***) indicates p < 0.001 and four asterisk (****) indicate
  p < 0.0001. Abbreviations: rGO, reduced graphene oxide; GN, graphene; C, control
  group (untreated group); ExF, exfoliation; ATS, ammonium thiosulfate; TUD, thiourea
  dioxide. Notes: Cell mobility data were analyzed from three independent cultures.
  Within each co-culture, 100 cell pathways were analyzed in ImageJ using the TrackMate
  overlay. The average track duration and distance traveled were obtained from the
  100 paths. Three independent means from 100 paths were used for statistical calculations.'
