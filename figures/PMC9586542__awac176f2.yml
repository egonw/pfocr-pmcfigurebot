caption: Serum lipid profiles discriminate LRRK2 G2019S carriers from non-LRRK2 G2019S
  carriers in a multi-ethnic cohort. To determine which lipids may contribute to the
  discrimination of LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers from non-LRRK2 G2019S carriers,
  linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to identify the principal components
  that significantly differed between these two groups. The LRRK2 mutation group consisted
  of both asymptomatic carriers and manifesting Parkinson’s disease patients, while
  the non-LRRK2 mutation group consisted of control and idiopathic Parkinson’s disease
  patients. LRRK2 mutation carriers could be significantly discriminated from non-LRRK2
  mutation carriers. (A–E) Multivariate ANOVA covarying for age and sex identified
  four principal components, (B) PC17, (C) PC28, (D) PC30 and (E) PC32, were significantly
  different between LRRK2 and non-LRRK2 mutation groups. (F–H) The top 20 lipid species
  that contributed to the four principal components discriminating LRRK2 and non-LRRK2
  mutation groups. The dashed red line represents the expected value if the contribution
  of lipids were uniform. n = 221. WT = wild-type.
