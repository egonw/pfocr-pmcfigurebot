caption: Activation of the HIF pathway by DMOG, a PHD inhibitor, decreases sodium
  transport via the downregulation of ENaC and Na+,K+-ATPase in cultured mouse CCD
  principal cells. mpkCCDcl4 cells were exposed to 1 mM DMOG for 2, 6, and 24 hours.
  (A) Stabilization of HIF1α protein by DMOG assessed by western blot. β-actin was
  used as a loading control. A representative experiment from three is shown. (B and
  C) Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are expressed as
  a percentage of control values (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from three experiments
  in each group. (D) Monitoring of the transepithelial current in mpkCCDcl4 cells
  exposed to DMOG compared with control cells along the kinetic. Results are means±SEM
  from three independent experiments. (E) Decrease in ENaC subunits mRNA levels in
  response to DMOG assessed by real-time PCR and those of Na+,K+-ATPase subunits.
  (F) HIF pathway transcriptional activity was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis
  of HIF target genes PDK1, PGK1, VEGF, and GLUT1 mRNA levels. Results are expressed
  as fold of controls (dots) and means±SEM (lines) from three independent experiments
  are displayed. Unpaired Student’s t test was used in (C) and (D). Kruskal–Wallis
  test was used to compare data from (B). One-way ANOVA was used to compare data from
  (E) and (F). *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001, versus controls.
