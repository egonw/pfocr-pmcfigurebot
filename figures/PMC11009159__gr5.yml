caption: SOG1-p directly binds to early responsive genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway
  after γ-irradiation treatment or Xoo infection.(A) Biosynthetic pathways of phenylamide (phytoalexin)
  production in rice. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; PRA, phosphorubosyl
  anthranilate; CDRP, l-(O-carboxyphenylamino)-l-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate; I3GP,
  indole-3-glycerol phosphate.(B) Heatmap representation of gene expression levels
  in the phytoalexin biosynthetic network in the WT (DJ) and ku70 mutant (n = 3).
  Rice leaves were collected at 6 h after exposure to 40 Gy irradiation. The heatmaps
  are based on FPKM values from all samples. Green, low expression; red, high expression.(C)
  RT–qPCR analysis of phenylpropanoid pathway genes (Os01g0897600, Os07g0677600, Os04g0688300,
  and Os03g0235000) in rice leaves in response to γ-irradiation or Xoo (ZJ173) inoculation.
  Total RNA samples were extracted from leaves of 4-week-old seedlings at 6 h after
  γ-irradiation treatment or 48 h of ZJ173 infection. Rice UBQ was used for normalization.
  Experiments were performed three times. Data are means ± standard error (n = 6).(D)
  SOG1 binds to the four genes in (C) under γ-irradiation treatment or Xoo (ZJ173)
  infection. ChIP assays were performed with anti-FLAG antibody on the overexpressing
  line SOG1-FLAG-OE1 under normal growth, γ-irradiation treatment, or ZJ173 infection.
  Anti-histone H3 antibody was used as a non-specific control. Experiments were performed
  independently three times, and the qPCR assay was performed in triplicate with primers
  designed to target the putative motif regions in the promoters.
