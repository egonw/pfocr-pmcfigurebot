caption: 'Effects of hesperidin on cutaneous wound healing. Full-thickness wound (diameter
  = 1.0 cm) were made on the back of 8-week-old male C3H mice, and vehicle (50% ethanol,
  30% water, and 20% propylene glycol), hesperidin (1, 5 mM), E. daniellii extract
  (5 mg/mL), VPA (500 mM), or EGF (100 μM) were topically applied daily on the wounds
  for 14 days. (A) Representative gross images of wounds on day 14 and H&E staining
  (lower panel). Arrows indicate wound edges. (B) Wound sizes and relative wound-closure
  rates were measured as described in B. (C–F) Wounded tissues excised from C3H mice
  14 days post-wounding and subjected to IHC analysis. (C) Representative images of
  Masson’s trichrome, picrosirius red, and van Gieson staining of wounded tissues
  (n = 6 mice/group) 14 days after wounding are shown (n = 3 independent experiments).
  (D) Representative images of β-catenin, PCNA, keratin 14, and collagen I of wounds
  14 days after wounding are shown. Dashed lines demarcate the epidermal–dermal boundary
  (n = 3 independent experiments). (E) Mean intensity values for D (n = 3 independent
  experiments). (F) Immunoblotting analysis data for wounded tissue extracts obtained
  14 days after wounding. Original magnification: (A), ×40; (C,D), ×400. Values are
  expressed as means ± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.0005, significantly
  different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
