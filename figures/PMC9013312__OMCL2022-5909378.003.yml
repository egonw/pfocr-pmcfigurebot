caption: Transcriptome profiles for the myocardium of CK, DbCM, and SPM mice. (a)
  The heat map showing the 174 overlapped genes producing differentially expressed
  in DbCM and reversed expression by SPM. Red color shows the genes with significantly
  elevated transcription levels, and green color shows the genes with significantly
  reduced transcription levels. (b) KEGG pathway analysis of the DEGs belonging to
  metabolic related pathways of DbCM/CK. (c) KEGG pathway analysis of the DEGs belonging
  to metabolic related pathways of SPM/DbCM. Numbers and P values of DEGs in each
  pathway.
