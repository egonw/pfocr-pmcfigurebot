caption: Effects of JDNW on the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 in vitro and
  in vivo. (a–d) Effects of JDNW treatment at different time points on mitochondrial
  apoptosis-related proteins in liver tissues of ACLF rats. (e–h). Effects of JDNW
  serum on mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins of L02 cells. The data on quantified
  protein expressions were normalized by related β-actin. Each bar represents the
  mean ± SD of n = 3 (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, “ns” p > 0.05).
