caption: 'Effects of visfatin on LPS-induced myocardial cell apoptosis in mice. (a)
  The expression of cleaved caspase3 and Bcl2, apoptosis-related proteins, was detected.
  (b) TUNEL-positive cells were examined. N = 5−6 in each group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the
  saline + PBS group. #p < 0.05 vs. the LPS + PBS group. VFT means visfatin.'
