figure_title: NK1R regulates the AURKA-N-Myc pathway in tNEPC cells
caption: A Correlation analysis of NK1R expression and N-Myc expression in tNEPC patients.
  B The effect of NK1R overexpression on N-Myc and AURKA expression in 22Rv1 and LNCaP.
  C, D Co-IP assay by the antibodies of N-Myc or AURKA to detect AURKA/N-Myc interaction
  in LNCaP-NE (C) /LNCaP-NK1R (D) cells. E The effect of shRNA-mediated NK1R knockdown
  on N-Myc and AURKA expression in 22Rv1-NE and LNCaP-NE. F The effect of NK1R knockdown
  on AURKA/N-Myc interaction detected by Co-IP assay. IgG was used as a negative control
  antibody. G hHK-1 induced PKCα and AURKA phosphorylation in 22Rv1-NE and LNCaP-NE
  cells in a time-dependent way by western blot (left). Band intensity was calculated
  with Image J and normalized by control (down). H AURKA phosphorylation level was
  reduced by Aprepitant and GF109203X treatment in 22Rv1-NE and LNCaP-NE cells. The
  cells were pre-treated with aprepitant (2 μM) or GF109203X (1 μM) for 30 min and
  stimulated by 1 μM hHK-1 for 30 min before subjecting to western blot analysis.
  The band intensity was shown by Image analysis and normalized by control (right).
  I Co-IP assay by the antibodies of PKCα or AURKA to detect PKCα-AURKA interaction
  in 22Rv1-NE/LNCaP-NE cells. J Cell survival assay in 22Rv1, 22Rv1-NE/NK1R and LNCaP,
  LNCaP-NE/NK1R cells. Cells were treated with MLN8237 at indicated concentrations
  for 72 h. K MLN8237 reduced the protein level of CgA and ENO2 in 22Rv1-NE and LNCaP-NE
  cells. Cells were treated with MLN8237 for 24 h and the whole cell lysates were
  analyzed by western blot. Band intensity was calculated by Image J and normalized
  by GAPDH. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
