figure_title: Knockdown of SLC2A1/GLIS2 partially rescues metabolic phenotype defects
  in antagomiR-treated flies
caption: (A-B) RNAi knockdown efficiency of SLC2A1 and GLIS2 at 2 days and 5 days
  post dsRNA injection by qRT-PCR. (C-E) Effects of dsRNA treatment on the contents
  of TAG (C), glycogen (D), and total sugar (glucose plus trehalose) (at 5 days post-injection)
  (G). (F) Metabolic phenotypes of antagomiR-treated flies in rescue experiments.
  The experiments were performed by co-injecting dsRNA and antagomiR with co-injection
  of dsEGFP and the antagomiR-control (Ant-NC) as a negative control. Left panel represents
  the rescue for miR-275 deletion, and right panel for miR-305 deletion. Data represent
  10 biological replicates for each sample. One-way ANOVA was performed to determine
  statistically significant differences. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001,
  NS, not significant.
