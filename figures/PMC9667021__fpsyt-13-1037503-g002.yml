caption: The visualization of gene expression profiles. The gene expression data were
  normalized between arrays of mouse brain (A) and human blood (B). The crucial genes
  in the cuproptosis signaling pathway and the selected arrays of each dataset were
  visualized in a heatmap (C). ASD, autism spectrum disorder.
