caption: 'The annotation of identified unigenes in three databases. (a) GO function
  classification, where the horizontal axis shows the three GO terms: biological processes,
  cellular components, and molecular functions; the vertical axis shows the number
  of genes annotated under each term. (b) KOG function classification, where the vertical
  axis gives the names of the 26 KOG groups, and the horizontal axis gives the percentages
  of annotated genes. (c) KEGG pathway annotation, where the vertical axis gives the
  names of the KEGG metabolic pathways, and the horizontal axis gives the numbers
  and percentages of genes annotated to this pathway.'
