caption: M2 macrophages depletion and NOTCH1 signaling inhibition impaired PCa cell-derived
  xenograft growth. (A) Xenografts (n=5) were obtained from nude mice that were injected
  with 1×106 DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells (mixed with 2×105 THP-1-derived M2 macrophages),
  and pharm treatment was used (including PBS, DAPT, liposomal clodronate or combination)
  until tumor xenografts were formed. An IVIS-200 bioluminescence system was used
  to monitor tumor growth once a week, and node mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks.
  (B) Tumor xenografts were displayed as indicated. (C) The curve of tumor volume
  and weight of each group (n=5) was analyzed; group differences were analyzed via
  ANOVA. (D) Histological staining of CD31, Ki67 and N1ICD is displayed as indicated
  (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
