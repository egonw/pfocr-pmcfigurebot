caption: Factors decreasing CTL cell activity. Cancer cells express inhibitory molecule
  PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 on CTLs. This binding induces a negative regulatory pathway
  that limits CTL activity. Other inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as CTL-A4, and
  immunosuppressing molecules (i.e., IL-10, TGF-Î², IDO) could also negatively impact
  CTL activity.
