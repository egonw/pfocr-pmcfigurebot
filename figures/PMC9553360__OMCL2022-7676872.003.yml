caption: Suppression of cognitive deficits induced by Pb exposure are prevented by
  inhibition of Notch signaling. (a) Western blot analysis and shading analysis of
  Notch1, RBP-J, Hes1, and Hes2 in DG in Hippocampus in the three groups. (b) Western
  blot analysis and shading analysis of Notch1, RBP-J, Hes1, and Hes2 in olfactory
  bulb in the three groups. (c) Western blot analysis and shading analysis of Notch1,
  RBP-J, Hes1, and Hes2 in DG in Control, high-dose Pb exposure, DAPT, and high-dose
  Pb exposure+DAPT groups. (d) Freeze time during the cue and contextual fear conditioning
  test in the four groups. (e) Swimming speed, Platform+Edge frequency, and Lantency
  period during Morris water maze test in the four groups. ∗P < 0.05,∗∗P < 0.01.
