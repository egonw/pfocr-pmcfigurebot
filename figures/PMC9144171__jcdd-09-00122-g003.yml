caption: 'The same signaling pathway (Notch) can produce different effects based on
  location during early development (E9â€“E14 in mouse). In the AVC, myocardial cells
  have high BMP2/TBX2 levels. This represses expression of chamber markers (Nppa/Cx40)
  and leads to high activation of the Notch pathway in endocardial cells, resulting
  in EndoMT, ECM cardiac jelly deposition, and cushion formation. By contrast, Bmp2/Tbx2
  is lowly expressed in ventricular chamber myocardium and Notch activation in endocardial
  cells is lower; thus, EndoMT does not occur. Instead, Notch activates Nrg1 via EphrinB2
  and Hand2 to induce trabeculation and expression of Bmp10 in myocardium. A correct
  balance between Nrg1-regulated ECM synthesis and Notch1-regulated ECM degradation
  is necessary for normal trabeculation to occur. Vcan: Versican, Postn: Periostin,
  VECad: VE cadherin, Mfng: Manic fringe, Nrg1: Neuregulin.'
