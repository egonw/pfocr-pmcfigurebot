figure_title: FMRP levels affect tumor cell proliferation and vascularity in brain
  xenografts
caption: 'A Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance of the patient
  the GSC#163 line was generated from. B The left panel represents coronal brain sections
  of shNTC GSC#163 and shFMR1 GSC#163 grafts, where the latter showed remarkable tumor
  growth reduction. Right panel shows tumor volume quantification (mean ± SEM, n = 4/groups,
  **P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). Scale bar, 800 µm. C Kaplan-Meier plot showing the
  survival of mice grafted with shNTC GSC#163 (red line; n = 4 mice; median survival
  15 weeks) and shFMR1 GSC#163 (blue line; n = 4 mice; median survival 24 weeks) (P = 0.006,
  log-rank test). D Immunohistochemistry with anti-FMRP antibody shows a lower signal
  in GSC #163 shFMR1 xenografts compared to GSC #163 shNTC xenografts. Scale bar,
  40 µm. E Left panel, representative anti-Ki67 immunohistochemistry (red) and DAPI
  (blue) of tumors derived from shNTC GSC#163 and shFMR1 GSC#163 grafts, expressing
  GFP (green). Scale bar, 30 µm. Right panel, quantification of Ki67 labeling index.
  (mean ± SEM, n = 4/groups, *P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). F Left panel, brain microvessels
  (red) were detected with Lectin. Scale bar, 45 µm. Right panel, quantification of
  the number of microvascular structures per microscopic field (mean ± SEM, n = 4/groups,
  ***P < 0.001, Student’s t-test).'
