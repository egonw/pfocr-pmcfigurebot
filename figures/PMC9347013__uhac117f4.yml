caption: CsGLK overexpression enhanced flavonoid biosynthesis. (A) Schematic diagram
  of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway with the catalytic enzymes. (B) The heat map
  shows the contents of detected flavonoid metabolites in WT and transgenic plants
  (CsGLK1-OE and CsGLK2-OE). Data represent average values from six biological replicates.
  (C, D) Total flavonoid (C) and OPC (D) contents in leaves and red ripe fruit of
  WT and transgenic lines. FW, fresh weight. Mean ± standard deviation values were
  obtained from at least 15 measurements. **P < .001 (Student’s t-test). (E) Heat
  map of relative expression levels of flavonoid biosynthetic genes identified in
  the transcriptome analysis of three genotypes (WT, CsGLK1-OE, and CsGLK2-OE). Data
  represent average values of three biological replicates. (F) qRT–PCR analysis of
  SlANR (Solyc04g015590) and SlLAR (Solyc05g009860) in WT and transgenic lines. Error
  bars indicate standard deviation of three biological replicates.
