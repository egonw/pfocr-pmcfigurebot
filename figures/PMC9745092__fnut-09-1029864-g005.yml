caption: Dietary CLA regulated the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis
  and lipid metabolism in the quadriceps femoris of mice. (A,B) RT-qPCR was performed
  to determine the expression levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis (ACC,
  LACS, DGAT1, and FAS) and lipid metabolism (CPT1, ACOX1, ACOX3, AMPK, LCAD, and
  CD36) in the quadriceps femoris of mice. The expression levels were normalized to
  GAPDH mRNA levels. Data were analyzed by t-test. *P < 0.05.
