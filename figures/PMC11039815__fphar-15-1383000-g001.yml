caption: Overview of cGAS-STING Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment after Ionizing
  Radiation Exposure. Ionizing radiation (lightning bolt) results in cytoplasmic release
  of mitochondrial dsDNA immediately and nuclear dsDNA eventually through micronuclei
  formation during cell division. This cytosolic dsDNA may be degraded by TREX1, a
  cytoplasmic endonuclease. cGAS activation involves two molecules of dsDNA bind to
  a dimer of cGAS (2:2 binding), which allows cGAS to form cGAMP from AMP and GMP.
  cGAMP intracellularly can activate STING in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which
  can then recruit TBK1. This complex brings in and phosphorylates IRF3, which then
  homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription
  factor for the production of type I interferons. STING can also act through the
  NF-κB pathway to lead to increased inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α,
  IL-1, IL-6, IL-8). cGAMP may also exit the cell via connexins/gap junctions, membrane
  transporters (e.g., LRCC8, ABCC1), or extracellular vesicles. dsDNA may also be
  contained in extracellular vesicles. Extracellular cGAMP not contained in vesicles
  is exposed to possible degradation by ENNP1, an endonuclease. cGAMP may be taken
  up by cells in the microenvironment via connexins/gap junctions, membrane transporters
  (LRRC8, P2x7R, SCL46A, SCL19A1), or via uptake of extracellular vesicles. The cGAMP
  can activate STING in recipient cells, and dsDNA uptake can lead to STING activation
  through recipient cell cGAS activation. This results in the paracrine/autocrine
  production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment.
  While the irradiated cell in this schematic was set to be a tumor cell, other irradiated
  cells in the tumor microenvironment (e.g., immune and stromal cells) may undergo
  similar cGAS-STING pathway signaling. Created with BioRender.com.
