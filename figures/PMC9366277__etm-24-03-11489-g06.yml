caption: 'AKIP1 participates in the invasion and migration of ccRCC cells by binding
  to Rac1. (A) The invasion and (B) migration of Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1
  and Ov-Rac1 were determined by Transwell and wound healing assays. (C) The expression
  of metastasis-related proteins in Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 and
  Ov-Rac1 was detected by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control group; ###P<0.001
  vs. siRNA-AKIP1 group; +++P<0.001 vs. siRNA-AKIP1+Ov-NC group. ccRCC, clear cell
  renal cell carcinoma; AKIP1, a-kinase interaction protein 1; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression.'
article_title: A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion,
  migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects
  the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.
