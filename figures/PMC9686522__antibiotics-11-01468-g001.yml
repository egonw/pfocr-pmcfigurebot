caption: Comparative investigation for exploring the effect of different substrates
  on the metabolic profile was made between Pleurotus spp. mycelia grown in substrates
  S2. Substrate S1 was taken as a reference and data were calculated as mean differences
  compared to S1 (calibrator of the relative quantification). In the figure, red indicates
  a higher probability of metabolic pathway activation, whereas blue suggests a minor
  one.
