figure_title: ADAM15 expression is upregulated in NSCLC cell lines
caption: A, B Data obtained from the Oncomine database (http://www.oncomine.org) were
  analysed to compare the ADAM15 levels in 20 normal and 226 lung cancer tissues,
  and data obtained from TCGA database were analysed to compare the ADAM15 mRNA levels
  in 103 normal and 999 lung cancer tissues (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). C NSCLC
  samples were immunostained with an anti-ADAM15 antibody. D Kaplan-Meier analysis
  of overall survival for ADAM15 expression in 719 adenocarcinoma samples. Kaplan–Meier
  plots were generated using Kaplan–Meier Plotter (http://www.kmplot.com). E qRT-PCR
  and western blot analyses of ADAM15 mRNA and protein levels in different non-small-cell
  lung cancer cells.
article_title: Integrin α3/α6 and αV are implicated in ADAM15-activated FAK and EGFR
  signalling pathway individually and promote non-small-cell lung cancer progression.
