caption: Correlation analysis of ZDHHC12 expression with signature pathways. (A) Correlation
  analysis between the expression levels of all ZDHHCs and the HALLMARK ROS pathway
  in ovarian cancer from TCGA (TCGA‐OV). Pearson correlation coefficient >0.2 and
  p‐value <0.01 is considered a significant positive correlation (as shown in red).
  Pearson correlation coefficient <−0.2 and p‐value <0.01 is considered a significant
  negative correlation (as shown in blue). (B) Patterns of ZDHHC12 expression levels
  between tumor and normal tissues. (C) Correlation heatmap showing the correlation
  between ZDHHC12 and HALLMARK signature scores across 12 tumor types with ZDHHC12
  expression levels significantly higher than normal tissues. Correlation values (R)
  and p‐values are shown. (D) Enrichment plots for HALLMARK or GO signature pathways
  associated with ZDHHC12 expression using ovarian cancer datasets from TCGA (n = 374).
  NES (normalized enrichment score), p‐value and false discovery rate (FDR) value
  of the correlation are shown. (E,F) Correlation analysis (Pearson's test) between
  ZDHHC12 and HALLMARK or GO signature scores using ovarian cancer datasets from GSE
  74357 (E, n = 529) and GSE 26193 (F, n = 107). Each dot represents an individual
  sample of human ovarian cancer.
