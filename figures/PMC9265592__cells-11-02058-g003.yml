caption: The effect of S1PR1 internalization in the lymph nodes and how regulates
  the gradient of lymphocytes between SLO/blood. This scheme shows the sequestration
  of naive T cells and CCR7 expressing central memory T cells due to the inability
  to response to the altered lymphocyte gradient between SLO/blood. S1PR = Sphingosine1-phosphate
  receptor; TN = naÏve T cells; TCM = central memory T cells; SLO = secondary lymphatic
  organs.
