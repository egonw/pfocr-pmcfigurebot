caption: E2 and Bnd inhibited osteoclastogenesis and the secretion of CCL2 and CCL7.
  (A) E2 (100 nM) significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis, resulting in fewer small
  osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors than observed under control conditions, while
  Bnd (200 μM) significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis, resulting in the presence
  of only a few giant cells and small osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors (n = 5
  per group). The number (C) and surface area (D) of osteoclasts were reduced in the
  E2 and Bnd groups (all P < 0.05). (B, E) The resorption lacunae were large in the
  control group, but there were smaller resorption lacunae in the E2 group and no
  resorption lacunae in the Bnd group. (F–J) CCL2 and CCL7 levels in the cytoplasm
  (G, H) and in the media (I, J) of BMMs or osteoclast precursors after induction
  on days 3 and 7 were significantly reduced by E2 and Bnd (all P < 0.01)). CCL2 and
  CCL7 levels in the Bnd group were lower on day 7 than on day 3 (G‐J) (all P < 0.01),
  **P < 0.001.
