caption: '12-LOX pathway. ARA C20:4n-6 is converted to 12S-HpETE and 12R-HpETE with
  12S-LOX and 12R-LOX, respectively. Either 12-oxo-ETE or the corresponding 12-HETE
  can be formed from these compounds. 12S-HpETE can also be converted to HxA3 or HxB3
  with hemin and lipoxygenases: eLOX3, 12S-LOX, or 15-LOX-1. 12R-HpETE can undergo
  a similar conversion to 11,12-bis-epi-HxA3. HxA3 may undergo further transformations.
  HxA3 can be conjugated to glutathione. HxA3-C is then formed, from which amino acids
  can be detached—HxA3-D is then formed in a reaction similar to the transformation
  of cysteinyl-leukotrienes. HxA3 can also be converted to TrXA3. Arrows next to enzymes:
  higher or lower expression of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.
  ↓—lower expression of given enzymes in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.'
