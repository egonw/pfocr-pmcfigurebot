caption: 'Impact of transcription factor knockouts on gene regulation, pseudotemporal
  progression, and discrete regulon modules in early pro-T cells. (A) 3D UMAP of all
  pool-perturbation samples, corresponding to 2D plot shown in . Here, cells are colored
  by inferred pseudotime, to relate cells to a common overall pseudotemporal advancement
  score regardless of trajectories. The pseudotime was calculated with Monocle 3,
  based on the trajectory inference from 3D UMAP built using the size and cell cycle
  scaled data as described in  (see , Gene and Cell Filtering, Data Alignment, and
  Clustering Analysis). (B) Pseudotime distributions (x axis) of cells from the indicated
  KOs (category axis), with medians indicated (red bars). The small “non-T-enriched”
  population seen in (A) was excluded from the calculation. Statistical significance
  of comparisons, each KO to control, by Kruskal-Wallis test of multiple comparisons.
  **, adj.p-val < 1E-02; ****, adj.p-val < 1E-04. Blue asterisks: faster, red asterisks:
  slower than Control (Cont). (C-D) Genes highly differentially expressed between
  control and KOs, full gene lists in . (C) Top 15 up-regulated genes (columns) for
  each KO (row). In each row (each specific KO), brackets enclose the top differentially
  expressed genes for that KO. Order of columns: Top 15 genes for Bcl11a KO are followed
  by top 15 for Spi1 KO if not already listed, followed by top 15 for Erg KO if not
  already listed, etc. Note that 8 of the top 15 genes in the Spi1 KO are shared with
  the Bcl11a KO and so add only 7 new genes (columns) to total, whereas 12 of the
  top 15 genes for Erg KO are not shared with Bcl11a KO or Spi1 KO. Only Meis1 KO
  and Hoxa9 KO did not define 15 significantly upregulated genes. Top 15 was defined
  by avg_logFC function on Seurat 3-processed data. Significance determined by Wilcoxon
  Rank Sum test, minimum expression fraction ≥ 5% cells in either the control or the
  KO, average “log expression” difference ≥ 0.1 (ln, baseline pseudocount=1), and
  adjusted p-val < 1E-02. (D) Top 10 down-regulated genes in each KO, with conventions
  as in panel (C), with average “log expression” difference ≤-0.1, and adjusted p-val
  < 1E-04. (E) Pairwise comparisons of top differentially expressed genes in each
  condition, determining to what extent different KOs may affect common target genes
  either in the same way (concordantly) or in opposite ways (discordantly); pvalues
  calculated by Fisher’s exact test. Left schematic shows that the chart depicts the
  intersection between genes increased (UP regulated) or decreased (DOWN regulated)
  by the perturbation shown on the y axis, and genes UP or DOWN regulated by the perturbation
  on the x axis. The top left rectangle, e.g., shows the enrichment of genes that
  are both increased in expression by the Tcf7 KO and decreased in expression by the
  Bcl11a KO. Other genes affected by an individual KO but not included in the intersection
  are not depicted. Right schematic: patterns of concordant or discordant regulation.'
