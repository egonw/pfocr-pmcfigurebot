caption: Development and characterization of mammary cancer models. A Oncoprint for
  somatic aberrations in TP53, BRCA1 and genes of the Rb pathway in METABRIC cohort
  of primary breast cancer samples. Data were analyzed on cBioPortal web site and
  included all 2509 patients (Curtis, Shah et al. 2012, Pereira, Chin et al. 2016,
  Rueda, Sammut et al. 2019). B H&E and IHC for T121 on mammary ductal hyperplasia,
  MIN and carcinoma in B1/P/Rbf mice. In early MINs, the epithelial cells lining ducts
  were hyperchromatic, with a small amount of cytoplasm, 2 or more layers of atypical
  cells and an increased mitotic rate. High-grade MINs had the additional criteria
  of greater cytologic and nuclear pleomorphism, and a further increased mitotic rate.
  Note focal expression of T121 (brown stain) in hyperplastic ductal epithelium. C
  Graphic representation of the spectrum of histological findings in induced mammary
  glands evaluated at various time points post-viral induction in all three genotypes
  (N = 5 mice per time point). D Example of solid and ductal histology of mammary
  adenocarcinoma in B1/P/Rbf mice, E Kaplan–Meier survival plot for mice of three
  different genotypes. Statistical analysis performed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test,
  F Adenocarcinoma histology of the occasional lung metastases (arrows). Scale bar
  200 µm

  in development of hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors,
  depending on inactivation of Rb family proteins.
