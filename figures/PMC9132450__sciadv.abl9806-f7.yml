figure_title: Oscillatory shear stress blocks SEMA3A-induced YAP/TAZ dephosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic localization
caption: (A) PLXNA1 overexpression modestly increases YAP phosphorylation. N-terminal
  tagged PLXNA1, PLXND1, and their mutant forms are cotransfected with HA-tagged YAP
  into HEK293A cells, which are seeded at the low or high confluence as previously
  described (). LPAR1 denotes the lysophosphatidic acid receptor. (B) Oscillatory
  shear stress blocks SEMA3A-induced YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic localization. HEK293A cells
  were treated with oscillatory shear stress for 2 hours in the conditioned medium
  of cells expressing SEMA3A or control vector. Immunofluorescence was performed to
  stain cells with YAP/TAZ antibody (red) and DAPI (blue). (C) Oscillatory shear (OS)
  stress blocks SEMA3A-induced Hippo pathway activation. Phosphorylation of YAP and
  LATS was determined by phos-tag and phospho-specific antibodies, respectively. (D)
  RhoA, not Rac1, is activated by oscillatory shear, which also blocks the deactivation
  of RhoA induced by SEMA3A. After indicated treatments, these cells were lysed and
  incubated with RhoA-GTP or Rac1-GTP–binding strips. The active GTP-bound Rho protein
  was recognized by specifically primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–linked
  secondary antibody. Signal was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer. The
  bottom panel was the total protein level of RhoA/Rac1 in cell lysates. OD, optical
  density. (E) Oscillatory shear stress does not affect interaction among RND1, p190RhoGAPs,
  and PLXNA1. HA-PLXNA1, Myc-ARHGAP35, and Flag-RND1 were cotransfected into HEK293A
  cells. HEK293A cells were treated with oscillatory shear stress for 2 hours in the
  conditioned medium of cells expressing SEMA3A or control vector. Flag-RND1 was immunoprecipitated,
  and coprecipitated Myc-ARHGAP35 and HA-PLXNA1 were detected by Western blot.
