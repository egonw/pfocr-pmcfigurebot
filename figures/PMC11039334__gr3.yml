caption: 'RGD-NPs activate STING signaling in vitro(A) Western blot (WB) analysis
  of STING activation in DC2.4 cells treated with different concentrations of MnCl2.(B)
  WB analysis of STING activation in BMDCs treated with nanoparticles (NP) and RGD-NPs.
  cGAMP and MnCl2 were utilized as positive controls.(C) Immunofluorescence staining
  of STING (red) and nucleus (blue) in BMDCs treated with NP and RGD-NP. Scale bar,
  10 μm.(D) Western blot analysis of p-TBK1 and PD-L1 expression in tumors treated
  with 0.1 mg NP or different concentrations of RGD-NP for 24, 48, or 72 h.(E) Real-time
  PCR analysis of immuno-related cytokine expression treated with RGD-NP. Data are
  represented as mean ± SEM. (ns: p > 0.05, ∗: p < 0.05, ∗∗: p < 0.01, ∗∗∗: p < 0.001,
