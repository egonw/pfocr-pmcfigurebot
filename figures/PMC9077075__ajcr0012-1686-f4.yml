caption: A. Effects of anti-tumor drugs on stemness markers expression and cell proliferation
  of tumor cell lines and their tumorspheres (TS) by flow cytometric analysis and
  MTT assay. Percentages of ALDH1 expression of ES2 or ES2TR160 and their tumorspheres
  treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC (5AZA) and/or IC50 of RAD001 by flowcytometric analysis.
  B. Cell proliferation assays of ES2 TS and ES2TR160 TS in the absence or presence
  of 10 μM 5-aza-dC and/or 10 μM RAD001 for seven days by MTT assays. (**P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  all by students’ t-test).
