caption: 'Kindlin‐1 interacts and colocalises with epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR), promoting the EGFR pathway in breast cancer cells. (A) Western blots of
  Kindlin‐1 and EGFR in different breast cancer cell lines representing the different
  subtypes (Luminal, Her2 and Basal) of breast tumours. The EGFR copy number is shown
  for each cell line. (B) BT20 cells were immunoprecipitated with either normal rabbit
  IgG, as a negative control (IP: IgG), anti‐Kindlin‐1 (IP: Kind1) or anti‐EGFR (IP:
  EGFR) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblotting with anti‐EGFR
  and anti‐Kindlin‐1 antibodies. (C) BT20 cells were transfected with control siRNA
  (si‐Ctrl) or Kindlin‐1 siRNA (si‐Kind1). Seven days after transfection, the cells
  were starved overnight and then treated or not with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. The
  cells were then immunostained with anti‐Kindlin‐1 (green) and anti‐EGFR (red) antibodies
  and counterstained with DAPI (original magnification: X100). (D) Cellular extracts
  corresponding to (C) were immunoblotted with anti‐EGFR, anti‐Kindlin‐1, anti‐phosphorylated
  extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK), anti‐ERK and anti‐GAPDH (loading control)
  antibodies. (E) BT549 cells were stably transfected with wild‐type Kindlin‐1 (Kind1)
  or the mutant form of Kindlin‐1 deficient in β1‐integrin binding (AAKind; QW611/612AA
  mutations). Cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti‐Kindlin‐1, anti‐pERK, anti‐ERK
  and anti‐actin (loading control) antibodies. (F) MDA‐MB‐468 cells were starved overnight
  and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cellular extracts were
  immunoblotted with anti‐pEGFR, anti‐Kindlin‐1 and anti‐GAPDH antibodies. (G) EGFR
  and Kindlin‐1 protein expression in 29 breast cancer cell lines from CCLE. Estrogen
  receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Her2 status and breast cancer subtype
  have been reported. (H) Correlation between EGFR and Kindlin‐1 protein levels in
  CCLE cell lines presented in (G) (Spearman''s rank correlation test). (I) Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot showing the enrichment of the EGFR pathway in CCLE
  cell lines (n = 58) categorised into high (n = 19) versus low (n = 39) Kindlin‐1
  expression groups. FDR, false discovery rate q value; NES, normalised enrichment
