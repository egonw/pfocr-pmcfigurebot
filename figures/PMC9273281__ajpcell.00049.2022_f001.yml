caption: Ovarian cancer-relevant SASP regulators. Cytoplasmic dsDNA or cytoplasmic
  chromatic fragments (CCFs) activate the cGAS-STING pathway, which in turn promotes
  SASP gene transcription via two main transcription factors NF-κB and C/EBP-β. The
  SASP is also transcriptionally regulated by p53, p16/RB, DOT1L, HMGB2, METTL3/14
  and others. mTORC1 promotes translation of SASP mRNAs. SASP, senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype.
