caption: 'The evolution and RNA expression of two key enzymes in TAG synthesis. A
  Overview of the synthesis pathway from glycerol-3-phosphate to TAG. The gene number
  in the two sequenced microalgae and nine other heterokontophytes is shown in rectangle
  (from left to right, V. sp. H4302, V. stellata, V. sp. C74, Mo. sp. C73, Mo. sp.
  C141, Mi. gaditana, N. oceanica, E. siliculosus, S. japonica, P. tricornutum, T.
  pseudonana). The color of rectangle is reflection of relative size of the gene number
  in each row. Genes: GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the
  DGAT gene family (Pfam motif: PF03982) from eleven heterokont genomes. Seven clades
  are identified based on the divergence distance and outgroup species (four non-Eustigmatophyceae
  species). C Phylogenetic tree of the PDAT gene family (Pfam motif: PF02450). D RNA
  expression of the PDAT gene family (upper panel) and the DGAT gene family (bottom
  panel) in V. cf. polyphem. NR, nitrogen repletion, 18 mM of initial nitrogen concentration
  (INC); NF, nitrogen-free, 0 mM of INC; NRC, nitrogen recovery, 15 days of NF culture,
  followed by transfer to 18 mM of INC medium; PF, phosphorus-free; SF, sulfur-free'
article_title: The genomes of Vischeria oleaginous microalgae shed light on the molecular
  basis of hyper-accumulation of lipids.
