caption: A schematic representation of the role of KUF1 in response to environmental
  stresses. A,  identified KUF1 as a negative regulator of several physiological processes
  associated with drought resistance, including stomatal closure, ABA responsiveness,
  cuticle formation, and possibly other downstream targets that remain unidentified.
  KAI2, a receptor in the karrikin pathway, was previously found to have functions
  opposite to KUF1 (). B, In well-watered conditions, Arabidopsis seedlings in which
  the KUF1 gene was knocked out show slightly reduced biomass compared to wild-type
  (WT) plants (). Under moderate drought, kuf1 mutants showed less biomass reduction
  than WT plants. Upon severe drought stress, kuf1 mutants survived on average four-fold
  better than WT plants. Made with Biorender.com.
