caption: 'Modulation of cell cycle by bLF and rhLF demonstrated on the example of
  different cancer cells lines. During the cell cycle, LF can inhibit or activate
  several checkpoint regulators such as: cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), and their
  associated inhibitor partners of the Cip/Kip family proteins (p21, p27), DNA damage
  response genes (p53) or mTOR/S6K pathway. In response to bLF and rhLF cancer target
  cells arrest in G0/G1 phase (e.g., HSC3 cells, head and neck cancer line), G1/G2
  phase (e.g., OSCC, MDA-MD-231 cells, nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells), G2/M phase
  (e.g., ALL cells) or S phase (e.g., MDA-MB-231 cells, A549 cells). Key molecules
  that lead to cell cycle arrest are indicated by the red arrows. Illustration was
  created in BioRender.com (accessed on 21 April 2022).'
