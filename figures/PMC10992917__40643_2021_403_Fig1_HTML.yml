caption: Possible strategies to produce BB via a single strain aided by lipase or
  alcohol acyltransferases (AATs). a The microorganism can produce butanol then external
  butyrate and lipase are added in the fermentation to undergo the esterification
  process. b Some clostridia strains, such as C. tyrobutyricum, can produce high butyrate.
  Thus, it requires an external addition of butanol and lipase to the fermentation
  for butyl butyrate synthesis. c Engineered microorganisms with the strong C4 pathway
  expressed with AAT can accumulate butyryl-CoA and butanol for BB biosynthesis. In
  case they have low levels of aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase activity, butanol
  needs to be externally supplemented to the fermentation medium (indicated by a purple
  dashed line)
