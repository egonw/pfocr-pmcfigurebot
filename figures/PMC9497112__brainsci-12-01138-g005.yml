caption: Differentially active metabolic pathway between subtypes. (A) Scale-free
  fit index versus soft-thresholding power. (B) Mean connectivity versus soft-thresholding
  power. (C) An adjacency-based clustering of dissimilarity-based clustering of genes
  is presented as a tree (dendrogram). According to the dynamic tree cut method, the
  colored row below the dendrogram indicates module membership, together with the
  color assigned to the merged modules and the original colors. (D) WGCNA module correlations,
  colored red for positive correlations and blue for negative correlations. (E) The
  connectivity in each module. (F) The rows correspond to Modu Eigengenes and the
  columns to clinical phenotypes. Each cell contains the corresponding correlation
  and p values. Color legends correspond to correlations in .
