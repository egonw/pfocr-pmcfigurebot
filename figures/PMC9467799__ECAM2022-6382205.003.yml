caption: Modulation of SSD on SIRT1/NLRP3 signaling. (a and e) The protein expression
  levels of SIRT1, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were determined by Western blot analysis.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. (b, c, d, f, g, h) Quantitative analysis
  of western blot analysis normalized to SIRT1, NLRP3, and caspase-1.(versus sham),(versus
  SPID), and(versus SSD). Data represent the mean ± SEM.
