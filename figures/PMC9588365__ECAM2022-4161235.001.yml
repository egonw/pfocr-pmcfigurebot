caption: 'The flowchart of the network pharmacology-based strategy for deciphering
  the mechanisms of YPFG in pneumonia. The intersections of the active ingredient
  targets and the disease targets were regarded as common targets. The pivotal active
  ingredients were obtained through a common targets-active ingredients network analysis.
  The overlapping pathways were obtained through pathway enrichment analysis of the
  disease targets and common targets. Abbreviations∶ YPFGs. YuPingFeng Granules; TCMSP:
  traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology; PPI; protein-protein interaction,
  and OB; oral bioavailability. DL : drug likeness.'
