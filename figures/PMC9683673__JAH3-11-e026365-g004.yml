figure_title: Transfection of Sprague‐Dawley rat primary myocardial fibroblasts with
  the plasmid carrying the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene (Shhp) and plasmid carrying an
  RNA interference sequence targeting the Shh gene (Shh‐RNAi) upregulated and downregulated
  the expression of Shh, respectively
caption: A, Real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the cells
  (n=3 samples/group, *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001). B, Western blot analysis of the 3 groups
  (n=3 samples/group, ***P<0.001). NC indicates negative control.
