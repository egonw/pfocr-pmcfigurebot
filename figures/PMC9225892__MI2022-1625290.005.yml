caption: 'Vericiguat dually regulated RANKL-triggered activation of IκB-α/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (a, b) Western blot results of the expression of osteoclast-related signaling
  pathways (NF-κB, AKT, and MAPK) with or without RANKL stimulation (n = 3). ∗ indicated
  a comparison with the control group without RANKL. (c, d) Western blot results of
  the expression of IκB-α and NF-κB in BMMs after treatment with RANKL (50 ng/ml)
  for 30 min followed by Vericiguat with indicated concentrations. (e) Immunofluorescence
  staining of RANKL-induced P65 nuclear translocation with or without Vericiguat with
  indicated concentrations. (f, g) Western Blot and quantified results of MAPK and
  AKT in BMMs after treatment with RANKL (50 ng/ml) for 30 min followed by Vericiguat
  with indicated concentrations. n = 3 means three independent experiments. ∗ indicated
  a comparison with the control group (Vericiguat, 0 nM): ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. ns: not statistically significant. Scale bar = 100 μm.'
