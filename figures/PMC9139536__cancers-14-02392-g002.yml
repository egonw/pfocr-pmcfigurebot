caption: Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Plck-GAPDH mice initially upregulate
  the canonical NF-κB pathways (left) in the CD4+ T cells before disease symptoms
  are evident. This activation persists for 18–24 months and induces an inflammatory
  environment. When the mice develop lymphoma, the tumoral CD4 Tfh cells upregulate
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (right). This was confirmed by the upregulation
  of NIK in Tfh lymphoma cells, which are accompanied by GC B cells in which NIK is
  also upregulated. Several inhibitors of the NF-κB pathways are indicated and might
  represent a new therapeutic option for AITL. Figure generated by Biorender.com.
