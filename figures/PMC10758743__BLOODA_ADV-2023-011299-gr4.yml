caption: STRING analysis of significantly differentially expressed proteins comparing
  st-FL and nt-FL samples as well as st-FL and tFL samples. Different significantly
  disturbed cellular pathways identified in the STRING analysis based on (A) input
  of 242 proteins significantly differentially expressed at P < .05 comparing nt-FL
  and st-FL samples. The groups contain proteins belonging to apoptotic signaling,
  the cytoskeleton, cell cycle signaling, and the immune system. (B) Input of the
  800 proteins significantly differentially expressed at P < .05 comparing tFL and
  st-FL samples. The groups contain proteins belonging to the immune system, energy
  metabolism, cell cycle, cellular growth and activation, and the cytoskeleton. Nodes
  represent proteins and edges visualize interactions. The different cellular pathways
  visualized were significantly disturbed in the STRING analysis. Yellow indicates
  proteins involved in said pathway; blue, protein not involved in the pathway. ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; GTPase, guanosine triphosphatase.
