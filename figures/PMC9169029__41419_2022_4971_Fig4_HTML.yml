figure_title: STAT6 downregulates P53 signaling pathway to alleviate the ferroptosis
  by decreasing its acetylation modification
caption: A PPI network showed the relationship between STAT6 and ferroptosis related
  genes. Red nodes represented hub genes calculated by plugin Cytohubba. Red edges
  represented interactions between TP53 and its associated genes. B–D were performed
  upon GTEx lung tissue sample. B Venn diagram showed the overlap between 6089 genes
  that were significantly differentially expressed grouped by STAT6 and 1225 genes
  grouped by TP53. C Heat map showed the expression of 753 common DEGs in GTEx samples
  with genes associated with specific biological process annotated. D GSEA plot showed
  enrichment of KEGG term “P53 signaling pathway” in STAT6 low expression group. E
  HBE cells were transfected with indicated plasmid and harvested for immunoprecipitation
  and immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. F The protein lysis of lung
  tissue from WT and STAT6cKO mice were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
  analysis with the indicated antibodies. G The mRNA levels of P53, P21, SLC7A11 were
  measured by qRT-PCR assay. (n = 4, *p < 0.05, Vector/sh-Ctrl vs. OE-STAT6/sh-STAT6).
