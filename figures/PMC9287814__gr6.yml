caption: Regulation analysis based on gain/loss-of-function simulations(A) Inhibitory
  strength  associated with the inhibition of enzyme j by metabolite i for  (blue)
  and  (red).  indicates that inhibition reduces enzymatic activity by 2-fold.(B)
  Sensitivity factor  () of output Y with respect to several deletions of regulation  in
  abscisse, where the outputs Y are the metabolic responses of H2O2, NADPH, and G6P
  to oxidative stress relative to basal levels. Bars are mean values and error bars
  are standard deviations over the kinetic model ensemble .(C) Sensitivity factor  of
  H2O2 with respect to deleted regulation , ,  as function of H. The dose-specific
  areas of regulatory effect associated with each deleted regulation () is shown upper
  to the panel.(D) Response coefficients  and  () associated with modulated inhibition
  of upper and lower glycolysis  and  as function of H.(E) Second-order sensitivity
  factor  with respect to the combined deletion of two regulations in comparison to
  the single deletions.
