caption: Production of erythroid progenitor. Non-transduced CD34+ cells in presence
  or absence of Notch γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT as well as transduced CD34+ cells
  with shHIF1α or with shHIF2α were grown in erythroid medium for 8 days at 20% and
  at 3% O2. The numbers of burst-forming unit erythroids (BFU-E) and colony-forming
  unit erythroids (CFU-E) were estimated after 4 (a) and 8 days of culture (b). Bars
  represent average values of total number of BFU-E and CFU-E obtained at Day 4 and
  Day 8 of culture. (c) The values show average fold change in BFU-E or CFU-E Day
  8 number relative to Day 4. Data are presented as mean ± SD of seven independent
  experiments. Asterisks indicate a significant difference with respect to NT condition,
  at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**); hashtags indicate a significant difference with
  respect to 20% O2 condition, p < 0.05 (#), p < 0.01 (##), Mann–Whitney test. NT,
  non-transduced CD34+ cells; D, day of culture.
