caption: Activation of the PI3K, JAK/STAT and NF-κB pathways in lung is associated
  with increased cellular inflammation and the late asthmatic response (LAR). Akt
  phosphorylation, a downstream marker of PI3K pathway activation, was assessed after
  antigen challenge (OVA) in whole lung homogenate (A and B) pSTAT3 (C), pSTAT5a,
  b (D) and NF-κB (E) levels were assessed in whole lung homogenate and nuclear extract,
  respectively. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was taken to assess total leukocytes
  (F), neutrophils (G) & eosinophils (H) numbers. Whole body plethysmography in unrestrained
  rats was used to monitor the late asthmatic response (LAR; I). Data are presented
  as boxes (Q2 to Q3 with the median) and whiskers (min to max). Statistically significant
  differences between time matched, saline and OVA challenge groups is indicated with
  **p < 0.01 and ****P < 0.0001. Two experiments (n = 6 or 8)
