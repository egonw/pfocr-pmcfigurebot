caption: SAA promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in HUVECs. HUVECs were treated for
  24 h with SAA at concentrations of 10-3, 10-2 and 10-1 µM. (A) Mitochondria were
  stained with Mitotracker red dye. The integrated fluorescence intensity was analyzed
  to assess the mitochondrial mass relative to the vehicle group. (B) Mitochondrial
  density was assessed using transmission electron microscopy (magnification, x6,000).
  (C) mtDNA/nDNA was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and is
  presented relative to the control cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. vehicle.
  SAA, salvianolic acid A; mtDNA/nDNA, mitochondrial/nuclear DNA.
