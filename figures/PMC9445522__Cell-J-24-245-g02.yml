caption: circ_0006427 overexpression restrained multiplication, migration, invasion
  and EMT of NSCLC cells. A. circ_0006427 expression in A549 and H292 cells after
  circ_0006427 overexpression was detected using qRT-PCR. B. The CCK-8 method was
  employed to detect NSCLC cell multiplication. C-F. Transwell experiments were utilized
  to detect NSCLC cell migration and invasion. G and H. Western blot was performed
  to determine E-cadherin and Vimentin protein expressions in NSCLC cells. Original
  blots are shown in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org),
  Figure 2G. All experiments were repeated thrice with triplicate samples in each
  experiment. *; P<0.05, EMT; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NSCLC; Non-small
  cell lung cancer, and NC; Negative control.
