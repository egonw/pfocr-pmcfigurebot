caption: Schematic diagram of the innate immune response signaling pathway and evasion
  strategies upon influenza A virus infection. Upon viral replication, 5′-triphosphate
  single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) products are recognized
  by host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which include RIG-I. This leads to
  a conformational change in RIG-I and causes exposure of its CARD domains that are
  ubiquitinated by TRIM25. Then, RIG-I associates with MAVS at the mitochondrial membrane,
  starting a downstream signaling cascade that leads to IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB transcription
  factor activation and expression of type-I IFN. Secreted IFN-α/β produced by influenza
  A virus (IAV)-infected cells bind to IFNAR receptors in the cell surface, leading
  to JAK1/TYK2 phosphorylation and followed by binding and phosphorylation of STAT1
  and STAT2 that will form a complex with IRF9. This ISGF-3 complex will function
  as a transcription factor to activate and transcribe hundreds of genes, among them
  ISGs, with important roles in mediating the host antiviral response. Red boxes indicate
  specific sites at which IAV proteins interfere or block the host innate immune response.
  These mechanisms of evasion are more extensively explained in the text.
