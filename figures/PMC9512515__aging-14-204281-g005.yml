caption: Effect of different concentrations of realgar on ATP generation in APL cells
  for 24 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of realgar (0, 12.5,
  25.0, 50.0 and 75.0 μg/ml) for 24 h. Then, the ATP levels were measured using a
  commercial ATP assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were
  obtained from three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD.
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
