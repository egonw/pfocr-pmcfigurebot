figure_title: Transcriptional signature in HGPS primary fibroblasts
caption: 'A Scatterplot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of 2YO and 8YO HGPS
  fibroblasts. Common genes of 2YO and 8YO HGPS are shown in gray, 2YO HGPS unique
  genes in blue and 8YO HGPS unique genes in red. B Heatmap of DEGs from 2YO and 8YO
  HGPS vs. age-matched control cells (2YO Ctrl and 8YO Ctrl). C Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) showing enriched categories of common DEGs in 2YO and 8YO HGPS fibroblasts.
  D qRT-PCR of genes associated with fibrosis: Actb (actin beta), Actg1 (actin gamma
  1), Col1A1 (Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain), Ctgf (Connective tissue growth factor),
  Dusp1 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1), Fn1 (Fibronectin1), Myl9 (Myosin Light Chain9),
  SerpinE1, Thbs1 (Thrombospondin 1), Tpm1 (Tropomyosin 1), Tpm2 (Tropomyosin 2) in
  2YO and 8YO HGPS cells compared to 8YO control cells. E Cropped immunoblot for Collagen3A1
  (COL3A1) and GAPDH in 8YO control (Ctrl) and 2YO and 8YO HGPS. Plot represents COL3A1/GAPDH
  ratio based on the average for each experimental point, (n = 3). F Cropped immunoblot
  for Fibronectin1 (FN1) and GAPDH in 8YO control (Ctrl) and 2YO and 8YO HGPS. Plot
  represents FN1/GAPDH ratio based on the average for each experimental point, (n = 3).'
