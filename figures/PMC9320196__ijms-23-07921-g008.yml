caption: The complexity of transcriptional regulation in the Lolium multiflorum drought
  response. (A) The role of alternative splicing (AS) in the phospholipid signaling
  pathway. The black bars represent sequences, and the grey dotted lines represent
  gaps. (B) The HOX gene family is highly expressed in leaf tissues under drought
  and participates in intrinsic/integral components of the Golgi membrane. (C) The
  plant-specific gene HAK was highly expressed in root tissue under drought and is
  involved in K+ uptake. Red and green represent high and low expression, respectively,
  and the number in each box represents the corresponding read count.
