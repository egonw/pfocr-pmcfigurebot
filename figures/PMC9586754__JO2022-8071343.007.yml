caption: (a) The survival fraction of BxPC3-RR cells detected by colony formation
  assay after exposure to 0, 2, 4, and 8 Gy irradiation. (b) The CCK-8 assay was conducted
  to determine the viability of BxPC3-RR cells after exposure to 8 Gy irradiation.
  (c) WB was conducted to determine the expressions of CDK4 and cyclin D1 (proteins
  related to cell cycle); Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 (proteins related to cell
  apoptosis); γ-H2AX (a protein related to DNA repair); and β-catenin and c-Myc in
  BxPC3-RR cells after exposure to 8 Gy irradiation. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗P < 0.05.
