caption: 'Bar plot KEGG enrichment analysis. Each bar in the figure represents a KEGG
  metabolic pathway, and the number of genes enriched in a pathway corresponds to
  the length of the bar. The degree of significance of the enrichment in a pathway
  is represented by p.adjust value. (a): KEGG enrichment analysis of genes found on
  genomic islands in HN1; (b): KEGG enrichment analysis of genes found on genomic
  islands in HN2; (c): KEGG enrichment analysis of potential horizontal transfer genes
  in HN1; (d): KEGG enrichment analysis of potential horizontal transfer genes in
  HN2.'
