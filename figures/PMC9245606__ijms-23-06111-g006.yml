caption: 'HTR2A agonist DOI induces dendrites and migration of B16F10 cells: (a) The
  cell morphology of B16F10 cells treated with different concentrations of DOI (10,
  20, and 30 μM) and α-MSH (50 nM) is used as a positive control. Scale bar, 50 μm;
  (b,c) the dendritic number (b) and length (c) of the B16F10 cells treated with different
  concentrations of DOI (10, 20, and 30 μM) (n = 15); (d) Western blot shows the protein
  expression of GP100 (melanosome organization), RAB7/17/27 (melanosome transport),
  RAC1, and CDC42 (melanocytes dendrites) in B16F10 cells treated with DOI (10, 20,
  and 30 μM); (e) phalloidin staining shows the cytoskeleton in B16F10 cells treated
  with DOI (10, 20, and 30 μM). DAPI was used to mark the nucleus. The right row is
  the partial enlargement of the photos on the left. Scale bar, 20 μm (left), 10 μm
  (right); (f) cell scratch experiments show the migration of B16F10 after treatment
  with DOI (10, 20, and 30 μM) from 0 to 24 h. Percentage (%) of gap filling/wound
  healing was used to indicate the migration ability of B16F10 cells. Scale bar, 10
  mm. * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01) and *** (p < 0.001) compared to control group.'
