caption: 'Synthesis and metabolism of sphingolipids and ceramides. (A) De novo synthesis
  of sphingolipids begins with the condensation of serine and palmitate to 3-ketosphinganine,
  which is reduced to sphinganine. Ceramide synthase catalyzes the N-acylation of
  sphinganine to dihydroceramide, which forms ceramide after desaturation. SPT: serine
  palmitoyltransferase; KSA-reductase: 3-ketosphinganine reductase; DES: dihydroceramide
  desaturase; SphK: sphingosine kinase; S1P phosphatase: sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase;
  2EHD: (2E)-hexadecenal; CERK: ceramide kinase. (B) Salvage pathway of ceramide generation.
  Sphingomyelin and cerebroside are produced from ceramide. They can be trafficked
  to the acidic compartments, including late endosomes or lysosomes, and hydrolyzed
  to ceramide and sphingosine, which is then recycled to produce ceramide. Monoglycosylceramides
  include glucosylceramides (not shown) and galactosylceramides (shown). The latter
  can be reversibly converted to sulfatide by cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) or
  back to cerebroside by arylsulfatase A (ARSA, cerebroside sulfatase).'
