caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of colorectal cancer cells treated with TG1.
  (A) Identification of DEGs between TG1 treatment and control group based on RNA-sequencing
  data. Volcano plot displaying the significant 1837 upregulated DEGs (red) and 1437
  downregulated DEGs (blue). (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated
  DEGs between control and TG1 treated group from RNA-seq data. Bubble plot showing
  seven metabolic associated pathways (p-value < 0.05, q-value < 0.25). (C) GSEA analysis
  based on the log2 fold changes of protein-coding genes between control and TG1 treated
  group.
