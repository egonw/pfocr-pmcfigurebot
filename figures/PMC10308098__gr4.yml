caption: Increased cytokine expression and impaired inhibition of NF-κB activation
  by the mutations.(A) Elevated plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were found
  in proband patients compared to healthy controls. The data were pooled from 3 independent
  experiments. (B) PBMCs were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) or TNF-α (20 ng/mL)
  for 24 h. Then the supernatants were collected and tested for the cytokine expression.
  The representative result from three independent experiments is shown. (C) HEK293 cells
  were transfected with pNF-κB-LUC luciferase reporter, renilla luciferase reporter,
  and constructed expression plasmids as indicated. The NF-κB signaling pathway was
  induced by transfection of p65. After 24 h of transfection, cells were continued
  to culture for 16 h. Luciferase activities were determined on cell lysates. Protein
  levels were quantitated by Western blot analysis on the same lysates. The representative
  result from three independent experiments is shown. Values are represented as mean ± SEM.
