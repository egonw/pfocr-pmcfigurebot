caption: The altered signaling pathway in CD34+ cells of normal and MDS patients.
  A, Co-IP assay shows the binding of HSF1 to CSN5 and FBXW7α. Densitometry represents
  the expression of the proteins relative to input. B and C, The binding of HSF1 and
  FBXW7α was significantly increased in MDS cells. D, Co-IP assay shows the binding
  of STAT3 to C/EBP-β. E, Densitometry represents the expression of the proteins relative
  to input. All data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
