caption: The innate immune response of adipocytes and the modulation of SARS-CoV-2.
  Various pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR7/8, MDA5/RIG-I, and STING, play
  a crucial role in mediating innate antiviral responses. TLR7/8 detects single-stranded
  RNA, triggering the activation of IRF7 and the expression of IFN-α/β through the
  Myd88-dependent pathway. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize double-stranded RNA generated
  during viral replication, leading to the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 and the expression
  of IFN-α/β through MAVS. STING interacts with MAVS, activating IRF3/IRF7 and facilitating
  crosstalk between the RNA and DNA sensing pathways. These processes, essential for
  antiviral defense, can be hindered by SARS-CoV-2-derived non-structural proteins
  (Nsp)16, Nsp3, and Nsp1
