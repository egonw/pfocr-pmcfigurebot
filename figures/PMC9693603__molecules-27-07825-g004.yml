caption: Effect of azilsartan on colony formation ability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cell lines. (A) Representative images for the colonies formed before
  and after treatment with the IC50 of azilsartan in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
  (B) The percentage of colony forming efficiency of both cancer cell lines. Bars
  represent mean Â± SD, n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed using student t
  test, where * p < 0.05, compared to untreated cells.
