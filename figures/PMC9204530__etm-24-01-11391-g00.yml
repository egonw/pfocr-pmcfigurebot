caption: FBW7 expression is downregulated in Ang II-induced H9C2 cells and its upregulation
  activates mTOR-mediated cell autophagy. (A) mRNA expression of FBW7 in the control
  and Ang II (0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM) groups. (B) Protein expression level of FBW7 in
  the control and Ang II (0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM) groups. Overexpression efficiency of
  FBW7 in the control, Oe-NC and Oe-FBW7 groups was measured using (C) RT-qPCR and
  (D) western blotting. (E) Protein expression levels of LC3B-II/I, P62 and Beclin-1
  related to autophagy in the control, Ang II, Ang II+Oe-NC and Ang II+Oe-FBW7 groups.
  (F) Protein levels of p-mTOR and mTOR related to mTOR signaling pathway in the control,
  Ang II, Ang II+Oe-NC and Ang II+Oe-FBW7 groups. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. FBW7, F-box
  and WD repeat-containing protein 7; Ang, angiotensin; Oe, overexpression; NC, negative
  control; LC3B, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B; p-, phosphorylated;
  -, Ang II treatment without transfection.
