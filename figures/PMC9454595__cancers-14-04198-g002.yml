caption: 'In vitro data for OVCAR5 and OVCAR8 cells with transient overexpression
  of TMEM62. (A) qRT-PCR results from TMEM62 overexpression using a transient method
  and a dox-inducible model. Functional analysis includes (B) cell cycle of OVCAR5
  cells, (C) OVCAR8, and (D) OVCAR8-TMEM62-TetON cells at 72 h; apoptosis assay at
  (E) 48 h, and (F) 72 h using OVCAR5, OVCAR8, and OVCAR8-TMEM62-TetON cells, and
  proliferation assay of the same cells overexpressing TMEM62 at (G) 48 h and (H)
  72 h. (I) Senescence measurement of OVCAR8-TMEM62-TetON. Up: Western blot quantification/
  Bottom: Western blot image of Cleaved LaminB1 and Î²-Actin. (J) Heatmap of OVCAR8
  cells expressing TMEM62. (K) Pathway analysis generated from RNASeq using IPA. (L)
  Enrichment plot from RNASeq using KEGG.'
