caption: Que treatment promotes the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells
  via the activation of HIF-1α. (A) Western blot analysis of HIF-1α in pMVECs treated
  with vehicle or Que. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s
  t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 50 μm. (B)
  Immunostaining of HIF-1α and Lamin A/C in pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que. Right,
  the quantitative data of mean fluorescence intensity of HIF-1α in the nucleus. n
  = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data
  are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 50 μm. (C) Heatmap showing the relative
  expression level (row-scaling) of DEGs in pMVECs treated with Que versus vehicle.
  (D) Representative GO terms and pathways of upregulated and downregulated DEGs in
  pMVECs treated with Que versus vehicle. (E) GSEA showing HIF-1 signaling pathway
  (top) and HIF-1α target genes (bottom) enriched in pMVEC treated with vehicle or
  Que. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate. (F) Immunostaining
  of Ki67 in vehicle or Que-treated pMVECs. Right, the quantification of Ki67-positive
  cells in vehicle or Que-treated pMVECs. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale
  bars, 20 μm. Arrows indicate Ki67-positive cells. (G) Immunofluorescence staining
  of Phospho-H3 (Ser10) in pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que. Right, the quantification
  of Phospho-H3 (Ser10)-positive cells in vehicle or Que-treated pMVECs. n = 3 biological
  replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented
  as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 25 μm. Arrows indicate Phospho-H3 (Ser10)-positive
  cells. (H) Cell cycle analysis of pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que. n = 3 biological
  replicates. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s test was used and data are represented as
  mean ± SEMs. (I) Clonal expansion analysis of pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que.
  n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data
  are presented as the mean ± SEMs. (J) Wound scratch assay for detecting the migration
  of pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test is used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars,
  100 μm. (K) Angiogenesis was assessed by the formation of capillary-like tubes of
  pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que in vitro. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale
  bars, 100 μm. (L) NO production ability of pMVECs treated with vehicle or Que by
  FACS analysis. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test
  was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 50 μm.
