figure_title: KSR1 overexpression restores the induction of autophagy and inhibition
  of the MEK1/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway by AOS-SO4 treatment
caption: A Osteosarcoma cells were treated with AOS-SO4 for 48 h with or without transfection
  with HA-KSR1, and LC3 puncta were analyzed by the mRFP-GFP-LC3 construct. B Autophagosome-like
  structures (indicated by the yellow arrows) were assayed by TEM. C Protein levels
  of proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and KSR1, MEK1, and p-ERK in cells treated
  with AOS-SO4 for 48 h with or without transfection with the HA-KSR1 plasmid. Data
  are shown as the means ± SD from at least three independent experiments.

  osteosarcoma.
