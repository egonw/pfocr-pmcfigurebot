caption: 'lncRNA HHIP-AS1 increases HHIP mRNA stability by ELAVL1. (A) BM-MSCs transfected
  with overlapping sequence or non-overlapping sequence of lncRNA HHIP-AS1 and HHIP
  mRNA were analyzed by PCR. (B) qPCR validation of HHIP enrichment versus input after
  RNA pull down by two different specific probes (Bio-HHIP-AS1 OL and Bio-HHIP-AS1
  non-OL) as compared to a non-specific one (Bio-NC) in BM-MSCs. (C) Measurement of
  the stability of HHIP mRNA by RT-qPCR in the presence of transcriptional inhibitor
  (actinomycin D) at the indicated time as compared to an internal control 18S rRNA.
  (D, E) Using the web (http://service.tartaglialab.com/page/catrapid_group), we found
  that ELAVL1 has high affinity to the lncRNA HHIP-AS1, especially with the region
  that is complementary with HHIP mRNA. (F) RIP assay was performed in lncRNA HHIP-AS1-overexpressed
  and silenced BM-MSCs and the control cells. The qPCR assay was further performed
  to determine the enrichments of HHIP-AS1 and HHIP mRNA in ELAVL1 protein. IgG is
  as a negative control. (G) BM-MSCs were transfected with lncRNA HHIP-AS1 overexpression
  vector alone or in combination with ELAVL1 siRNA. Measurement of the stability of
  HHIP mRNA by RT-qPCR in the presence of transcriptional inhibitor (actinomycin D)
  at the indicated time as compared to an internal control 18S rRNA. The histogram
  data for each group are the average of three independent replicates; bars represent
  standard deviation; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs. NC or BM-MSCs without
  transfection; #P < 0.01 vs. BM-MSCs transfected with lncRNA HHIP-AS1 overexpression
  vector.'
