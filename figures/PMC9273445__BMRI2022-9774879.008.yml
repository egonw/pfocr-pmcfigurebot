caption: 'Pathway analysis of the four key CCGs. (a) The role of CCGs on cancer-related
  pathways in pan-cancer: red represents activation, green represents inhibition,
  and gray represents no effect. (b) Cancer pathways most associated with enrichment
  of key CCGs in glioma were showed. (c) In the above pathways, some genes showed
  rhythmic expression and showed close correlation with CCGs (FABP7, TTC28, FGFR2,
  PTPRE, DUSP11, FABP7, TEF, CIART, FMO2, SYSLTR2, GPR17, GJB6, ZBTB16, CALR, SFPQ,
  and SLC16A1).'
