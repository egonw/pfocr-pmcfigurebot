figure_title: Functional consequences of BAP1 deletion on the transcriptome, cell
  cycle progression and apoptosis in response to OTX015 treatment
caption: a Venn diagram showing the overlap between differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) downregulated or upregulated in parental M14 and BAP1 KO#1 cells upon 24 h
  OTX015 treatment (5 μM). b KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the downregulated
  DEGs in M14 BAP1 KO#1 cells upon 24 h OTX015 treatment (5 μM). The bars represent
  the enrichment scores as −log10 (adjusted P values). Pathways with adjusted P value
  <0.01 are shown. c The expression levels of the indicated genes (downregulated DEGs
  in M14 BAP1 KO#1 cells upon OTX015 treatment) were determined by qRT–PCR. Expression
  was normalized to GAPDH expression. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3)
  from one representative experiment out of three. d Immunoblot analysis was performed
  to measure the indicated protein expression upon 48 h OTX015 treatment in BAP1 KO
  clones and their isogenic parental cells. OTX015 concentrations are indicated in
  the figure. e Parental M14 or BAP1 KO#1 cells were treated with OTX015 at the indicated
  concentrations for 48 h, and their DNA content was determined by flow cytometry
  analysis. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3) from one representative
  experiment out of three. f Parental M14 or BAP1 KO#1 cells were treated with OTX015
  at the indicated concentrations for 96 h. Cell apoptosis was assessed by phosphatidylserine
  externalization and binding of Annexin V-FITC. The data are presented as the mean ± SD
  (n = 3) from one representative experiment out of three. One-way ANOVA test was
  used.
