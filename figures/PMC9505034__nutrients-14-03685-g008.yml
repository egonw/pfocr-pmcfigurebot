caption: 'Effect of EEIP pre−administration on thermogenic factors in the brown adipose
  tissue (BAT) of HFD−fed obese mice (A) The brown adipose tissue weight of HFD−fed
  obese mice. (B) The protein expression levels of thermogenesis factors involving
  UCP−1, SIRT1, PGC−1α, and COX IV were determined by Western blotting analysis and
  β−actin was used as an internal control. Densitometric analysis was performed using
  Bio−Rad Quantity One Software (BioRad; Hercules, CA, USA). Values are represented
  as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 vs. normal diet control group; * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. HFD group.'
