caption: 'The extracellular matrix and FAK activation are associated with resistance
  to mTORC1 inhibitors. (A) Ranking of genes by their Spearman’s correlation coefficient
  to S6 (RPPA) from 876 breast cancer patients in the TCGA, Pan-Cancer Atlas dataset.
  Red dots are genes that comprise the ECM remodeling Reactome pathway. Reactome pathway
  enrichment analysis of the (B) top and (C) bottom 10% of genes correlated with S6
  protein in breast cancer. (D) Protein expression of phosphorylated FAK (pFAK Y397),
  total FAK (FAK), and β-actin (loading control) in 14 breast cancer cell lines. Quantitation
  of pFAK to FAK and FAK to total protein () are shown. (E) Scatterplot illustrating
  the correlation between the pFAK:FAK ratio to rapamycin growth inhibition. r = Pearson’s
  correlation coefficient, two-tailed p-value. Colors represent breast cancer receptor-defined
  subtypes: red, ER+/PR+/HER2-, green, ER+/PR+/HER2+, orange, ER-/PR-/HER2+, blue,
  ER-/PR-/HER2-. (F) Scatterplot illustrating the correlation between relative rapamycin
  growth inhibition and the calculated FAK/total protein ratio.'
