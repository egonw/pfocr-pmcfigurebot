caption: The heat map shows the proportion and abundance of functional pathways and
  gene families involved in the nitrogen cycle in pond sediments. The numbers on the
  ordinate represent the nitrogen cycle metabolic pathways annotated by KEGG, and
  the contents in brackets are the functional genes involved in the metabolic pathway.
