caption: 'Genes involved in glucagon signaling are affected during the earliest stage
  of disease. A significant number of genes belonging to the glucagon signaling pathway
  (KEGG: 04922) and GO term 32024: Positive regulation of insulin secretion were found
  to be altered in the islets of 10-day-old NOD vs. age-matched NOD.B10 mice (A–C).
  QPCR analysis was performed to confirm the upregulation of glucagon receptor (Gcgr)
  and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (Gipr; blue arrows) in
  a separate cohort of 10-day old NOD and NOD.B10 mice (D and E). The mean ± SEM are
  shown, and statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student unpaired
  t test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Panels A–C were generated using iPathwayGuide. FFA,
  free fatty acid; FDH and LDH are proteins; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
