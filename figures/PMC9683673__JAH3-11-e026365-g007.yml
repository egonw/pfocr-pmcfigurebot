figure_title: Effects of 5/6 nephrectomy and GANT‐61 on the expression level of components
  of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway in Sprague‐Dawley (SD) rats and Cell Counting Kit‐8
  (CCK‐8) assay using cardiac fibroblasts
caption: A through C, Immunohistochemistry in the myocardium of the SD rats (n=6 rats/group,
  not significant [ns], **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001; bar=50 μm). D, Real‐time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction analysis of glioma 1 (Gli‐1) expression in SD rat myocardial
  tissues (n=6 rats/group, ***P<0.001). E through G, Immunofluorescence staining in
  the myocardium of the SD rats (n=6 rats/group, ns, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001; bar=50
  μm). H, Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 promoted the proliferation of primary
  myocardial fibroblasts in SD rats by activating the Sonic Hh (Shh) signaling pathway.
  The optical density (OD) value represents the number of cells (n=3 rats/group, **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001). CKD indicates chronic kidney disease; NC, negative control; Shhp,
  plasmid carrying the Shh gene; Shh‐RNAi, plasmid carrying an RNA interference sequence
  targeting the Shh gene; and Smo, Smoothened.
