caption: MOX protects the myocardium by inhibiting excessive mitochondrial fission
  and mitophagy through the FUNDC1 pathway. (A) DOX leads to chronic heart failure
  by promoting excessive mitochondrial fission and mitophagy; moxibustion could inhibit
  excessive mitochondrial fission and mitophagy for myocardial protection. (B) Moxibustion
  downregulates the mitochondrial outer membrane protein FUNDC1 and reduces the recruitment
  of the mitochondrial mitotic proteins DRP1, FIS1 and LC3, inhibiting excessive mitochondrial
  fission and mitophagy. After scavenging via mitophagy, mitochondrial fragments further
  occur through the binding of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 to FUNDC1, resulting
  in mitochondrial fusion. (C) Effectors of the FUNDC1 signaling pathway. MOX moxibustion;
  FUNDC1, FUN14 domain-containing protein 1; DOX, doxorubicin; DRP1, dynamin-related
  protein 1; FIS1, fission 1 protein; OPA1, optic atrophy 1; ULK1, Unc-51 Like Autophagy
  Activating Kinase 1; PGAM5, phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5; DRP1, dynamin-related
  protein 1.
