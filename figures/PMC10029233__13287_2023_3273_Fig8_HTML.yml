caption: UCMSCs-CM could significantly inhibit cell viability, cell migration and
  invasion, induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and promote apoptosis of KGN cells
  at high density through restoration of contact inhibition of KGN cells by activating
  the Hippo pathway
article_title: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells conditioned medium exerts
  anti-tumor effects on KGN cells in a cell density-dependentÂ manner through activation
  of the Hippo pathway.
