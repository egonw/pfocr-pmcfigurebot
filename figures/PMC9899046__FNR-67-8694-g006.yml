caption: 'IP6 regulates the FOXO3/CCND1 signaling pathway in rats. (a) The relative
  mRNA expression levels of Hdac3 in the distal small intestine (n = 6 per group).
  Values were normalized to Actb expression. (b) The relative mRNA expression levels
  of Foxo3 in the distal small intestine (n = 6 per group). Values were normalized
  to Actb expression. (c) The relative mRNA expression levels of Ccnd1 in the distal
  small intestine (n = 6 per group). Values were normalized to Actb expression. (d)
  Western blotting analysis of the mucosa of the distal small intestine was performed
  to detect the protein expression levels of HDAC3, H3K9AC, FOXO3, and CCND1. Histone
  H3 was used as an internal control. (e) Relative protein expression of HDAC3, H3K9AC,
  FOXO3, and CCND1 of the mucosa in the distal small intestine. Values are mean Â±
  SEM; ns, not significant; ** P < 0.01, SBS group versus Sham group; #P < 0.05, ###P
  < 0.001, SBS + IP6 group versus SBS group.'
