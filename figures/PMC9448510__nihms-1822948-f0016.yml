figure_title: The impact of BHB and HOPX on colorectal cancer biopsies
caption: a, Workflow of analysis of CRC patient cohort. b, Serum BHB levels in 41
  colon cancer patients. c, d, UMAP clustering (c) and marker gene expression (d)
  in single-cell RNA-sequencing data of colonic biopsies from nine CRC patients. e–h,
  Epithelial HOPX expression binned by serum BHB levels (e), correlation of average
  epithelial HOPX expression with serum BHB (f), correlation of epithelial cell cycle
  progression with serum BHB (g), and correlation of the proportion of cells in S
  phase with the proportion of HOPX-expressing epithelial cells (h) as determined
  by single-cell RNA-sequencing of colonic biopsies of tumour and normal tissue from
  nine CRC patients. Error bars indicate means ± SEM. The p- and R-values were determined
  by linear regression. i, Cartoon illustrating that ketogenic diet induces BHB, which
  in turn signals via HCAR2 to induce HOPX, decelerate proliferation of the colonic
  crypt, and suppress cancer development. This pathway is contrasted with the mechanisms
  engaged by other tumour-modulatory diets. Exact n and p-values are presented in
  .
