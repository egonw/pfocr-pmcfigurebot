caption: Proposed relationships of PTS, cAMP-Crp, respiration, ROS accumulation, and
  damage repair in stress-mediated bacterial death. Bactericidal treatments produce
  primary lesions (a) that are recognized by repair systems (b). If repair is sufficient,
  cells survive (c) unless overwhelmed by downstream damage. Repair increases demand
  for ATP and stimulates respiration (d), resulting in elevated ATP synthesis. ROS
  accumulate as by-products during ATP synthesis (e); ROS damage macromolecules (f),
  including DNA, protein, and lipids. Macromolecular damage from ROS stimulates additional
  ROS accumulation and damage in a self-amplifying cycle (f and g) that leads to cellular
  repair being overwhelmed and ultimately to cell death unless ROS-detoxifying systems
  are sufficient to suppress ROS accumulation (h). The demand for ATP by repair also
  stimulates carbohydrate metabolism via the PTS (i), which in turn stimulates adenyl
  cyclase (j) to synthesize cAMP (k). cAMP binds to and activates Crp (l), which up-regulates
  genes involved in the TCA cycle (m), thereby producing elevated levels of NADH that
  fuel respiration (n), subsequent ATP synthesis, and ROS production. L-shaped green
  shading indicates pathways from which pan-tolerance mutants may emerge.
