caption: The GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses results for the differentially expressed
  genes between high-MMP1 and low-MMP1 groups. (a, c) GO (upper panel) and KEGG (low
  panel) analysis for the correlated genes in MMP1-high group. (b, d) GO (upper panel)
  and KEGG (low panel) analysis for the correlated genes in MMP1-low group. (eâ€“h)
  Functional annotations of DEGs between two groups by GSEA analyses revealed high
  enrichment in several cancer-relevant categories including enriched in EMT pathway
  (e), epidermal cell differentiation (f), focal adhesion (g), and P53 signaling pathway
  (h). GSEA enrichment plots with normalized enrichment score (NES) and P-values were
  shown.
