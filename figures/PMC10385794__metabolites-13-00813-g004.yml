caption: 'AtCoq9 rescues a yeast coq9 temperature-sensitive mutant. (A) Growth of
  S. cerevisiae strains transformed with the following plasmids: WT strain BY4742
  transformed with the empty vectors or the coq9 mutant strain transformed with the
  empty vectors (vec), empty vector pRS315 and yeast COQ9 on pRS423 (ScCoq9), empty
  vector pRS423 and TS19 on pRS315 (TS19), TS19 on pRS315 and human COQ9 on pRS423
  (TS19 + HsCOQ9), and TS19 on pRS315 and pRS423-AtCoq9 (TS19 + AtCoq9). Serial dilutions
  were spotted onto SD-Leu-His or YPG plate media and incubated at either 25 °C or
  37 °C. (B) Quantification of CoQ6 contents. Yeast cells were cultivated in SD-Leu-His
  liquid media containing 2% glucose and grown overnight at either 25 °C or 37 °C.
  Lipids were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS. Asterisks indicate significant difference
  compared to TS19 + vec with * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 (two-tailed Student’s t tests).
  Data are means of three biological replicates ± SE.'
