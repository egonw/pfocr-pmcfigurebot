caption: Canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (A), Illustrated
  are the top five canonical pathways (p < 0.05) based on 904 differentially expressed
  proteins in the mdig KO vs. WT MDA-MB-231 cells. (B), Canonical pathway analysis
  revealed the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling pathway among the topmost
  canonical pathways enriched upon mdig KO. The EIF2 Signaling has been elaborated
  by showing the upregulated and downregulated proteins and their cellular localization.
  Nodes represent molecules in a pathway, whereas the biological relationship between
  nodes is represented by a line (edge). Edges are supported by at least one reference
  in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of color in a node indicates the
  degree of up (red) or down (green) regulation.
