figure_title: The IL-33/ST2 pathway and its conceptual role following ischemic stroke
caption: A) The main components of the IL-33/ST2 axis are shown. Once released, IL-33
  binds the ST2L receptor and the IL-1RAP co-receptor. ST2L and IL-1RAP then recruit
  intracellular MyD88, which prevents is activity in TLR4-mediated, pro-inflammatory
  signaling. In this model, IL-33 is anti-inflammatory and when sST2 level is high,
  this prevents IL-33 signaling. The decoy receptor sST2 is therefore pro-inflammatory.B)
  A conceptual depiction of the phases of the inflammatory response after acute CNS
  injury. Immune cells are activated during the initiation phase, when DAMPs are released
  and bind to TLR4 receptors. In the first few days after CNS injury, the pro-inflammatory
  immune response is further amplified, which is characterized by systemic release
  of cytokines and recruitment of peripheral innate immune cells, including neutrophils
  and macrophages. The activity of these cells leads to blood-brain barrier disruption
  and brain edema. Subsequently, this is followed by a resolution phase where an anti-inflammatory
  immune response promotes the clearance of debris and establishes a substrate for
  subsequent neural repair. Existing data suggests that sST2 can amplify the pro-inflammatory
  phase and potential forestall the transition to reparative immune responses, making
  this pathway of interest from a therapeutic standpoint. Images created with BioRender.com.
