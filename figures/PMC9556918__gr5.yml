caption: Probiotic yogurt altered serum, urine, and fecal metabolome two months after
  treatment(A) Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots of
  HUA and INT groups (n = 9).(B) Volcano plots of serum, urine, and fecal metabolome.
  Red, significantly upregulated (p < 0.05).(C) Histograms show the relative signal
  intensities for marker metabolites of the HUA and INT groups in serum, urine, and
  fecal.∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01 versus HUA group.(D) Disturbed pathways in response
  to HUA and INT groups.(E) Schematic overview of the metabolites and relevant pathways
  changing for GR-3 intervention according to the KEGG PATHWAY database. The important
  correlation networks of the potential biomarkers in the experiment. Metabolites
  with a blue dashed area present a significant decrease in the INT group compared
  to the HUA group. Metabolites with a red dashed area present a significant increase
  in the INT group compared to the HUA group.
