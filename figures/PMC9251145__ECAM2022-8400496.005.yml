caption: 'Sal B or TAK-242 counteracted the iopromide-induced apoptosis. (a, b) Sal
  B or TAK-242 reduced the number of apoptotic cells, as seen in flow cytometry. n = 3.
  Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.
  (c) Sal B reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 n = 3. Data are the
  mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.'
