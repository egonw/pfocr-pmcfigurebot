caption: 'Intrathecal administration of C3 antibody alleviated neuropathic pain and
  decreased M1 microglia polarization. A. Immunostaining showed C3 expression after
  intrathecal administration of IgG and C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul) on POD12. Scale bar:
  100 μm. B. Data summary of fluorescence intensity of C3 for CCI rats receiving intrathecal
  administration of IgG and C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul). ****p < .0001, N = 9 sections
  from 3 rats, t test. C–D. Mechanical allodynia (C) and thermal hyperalgesia (D)
  in CCI model were attenuated by intrathecal administration of C3 antibody. The gray
  panel indicated the duration of drug administration from POD7 to POD12. N = 7, Two-way
  ANOVA, ****p < .0001, CCI + IgG versus CCI + C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul); ###p < .001,
  ####p < .0001, CCI + IgG versus CCI + C3 antibody (0.10ug/ul); ^p < .05, ^^^p <
  .001, CCI + C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul) versus CCI + C3 antibody (0.10ug/ul). E. Immunostaining
  showed inhibitory effects of C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul) on activation of astrocyte
  on POD12. Scale bar: 100 μm. F. Data summary of fluorescence intensity of GFAP.
  N = 6 sections from 3 rats, **p < .01, CCI + IgG versus CCI + C3 antibody, t test.
  G. Immunostaining showed inhibitory effects of C3 antibody (0.25ug/ul) on activation
  of microglia on POD12. Scale bar: 100 μm. H. Data summary of fluorescence intensity
  of IBA1. N = 6 sections from 3 rats, ****p < .0001, CCI + IgG versus CCI + C3 antibody,
  t test. I. qPCR analyzed the expression of M1 (CD86 and inos) and M2 (CD206 and
  Arg1) markers for CCI rats receiving IgG or C3 antibody injection (0.25ug/ul) on
  POD12. N = 4, *p < .05, **p < .01, CCI + IgG versus CCI + C3 antibody, t test. CCI:
  chronic constriction injury.'
