caption: Characteristics of resistant HER2-positive cell lines. A. HER2 expression
  and lack of estrogen receptor expression was confirmed through protein analysis
  in three resistant cell lines. HCC1569 cells, unlike two other cell lines, had no
  PTEN expression. B. All three cell lines showed resistance to trastuzumab within
  the range of 0.5-16 Î¼g/mL. C, D, Prominent antiproliferative effects are shown after
  resistant cells were treated with different concentrations of alpelisib and GDC-0077.
  At the same concentration of PI3K inhibitor, HCC1569 cells exhibited relative resistance
  compared with HCC1954 and UACC893 cells. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay
  72 hours after incubation with the indicated drugs and normalized that of non-treated
  cells. Each plot indicates the mean value of at least triplicate measurements and
  error bars indicate the SD.
