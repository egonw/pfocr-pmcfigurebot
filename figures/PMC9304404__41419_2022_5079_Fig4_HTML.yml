figure_title: Apatinib promoted the intake of glutamine by upregulating the expression
  of SLC1A5
caption: A Intracellular concentrations of glutamine, glutamate, asparagine, and aspartate
  in A459 and H460 cells incubated with apatinib or negative control (20 μM, 48 h)
  were detected by GC-FID. B LC–MS analysis of intracellular conversion of 13C-glutamine
  to 13C-glutamate in A459 and H460 cells incubated with apatinib (20 μM, 48 h) or
  negative control. C Schematic diagram of C and N metabolic flow in the reaction
  catalyzed by ASNS. D LC–MS analysis of the relative intracellular contents of 15N-labeled
  asparagine in control or apatinib-treated (20 μM, 48 h) A459/H460 cells. E GSEA
  of neutral amino acid transmembrane transporter activity-related genes. NES, normalized
  enrichment score; FDRq, FDR statistical value. F Heatmap of relative mRNA expression
  of neutral amino acid transmembrane transporter activity-related genes. G Protein
  and H mRNA levels of SLC1A5 detected by WB and qRT–PCR in A549 and H460 cells with
  apatinib (20 μM, 48 h) or negative control treatment. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  from three independent experiments.
