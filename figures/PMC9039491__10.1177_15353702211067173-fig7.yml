caption: GO and KEGG pathway analysis for LINC00941. (a) The bubble plot showed a
  significantly enriched GO pathway. (b) The bar plot showed a significantly enriched
  KEGG pathway. LINC00941 and its target mRNAs were involved in modulating several
  signaling pathways to enhance GC progression. (A color version of this figure is
  available in the online journal.)
