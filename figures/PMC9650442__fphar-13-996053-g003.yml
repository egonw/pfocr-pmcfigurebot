caption: 'Inhibition of ERK by SCH772984 suppresses the spheroid formation and stemness
  in HCT-116 but not in HT-29 cells. The photos show the morphology and numbers of
  tumor spheroids from HCT-116 and HT-29 cells after SCH772984 (SCH) treatment at
  different doses (A). A dose-dependent inhibition of sphere formation and growth
  in HCT-116 cells can be seen, comparing to that in HT-29 cells. (B), the number
  of spheroids was significantly decreased in HCT-116 cells at the 200 nM dose, but
  not in HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed surface marker expressions of
  CD133 (C) and CD44 (D) decreased in dose-dependent manners at the doses of 50, 100,
  and 200 nM in HCT-116, though there was a slight increase for CD24 (E). Inversely,
  the expressions of these markers increased (C, D, E) in HT-29 cells after SCH772984
  treatment. (F), the stem gene expressions of CD133, Lgr5, and TGF-β in HCT-116 cells,
  they all displayed a dose-dependent decrease after SCH772984 treatment. *: p < 0.05;
  **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001.'
