caption: 'Overall NEA of pathways associated with progression to osimertinib in NSCLC
  EGFR T790M patients. (A) Graph representation of pathway enrichment, ranked on numbers
  of individual links between AGS and FGS genes found in the global network. (B) Example
  of detailed network view of EGFR pathway enrichment versus AGS of most significant
  DEGs. Yellow: AGS genes; magenta: FGS genes. Genes without links to the opposite
  set (AGS to FGS and vice versa) are not shown. NEA, network enrichment analysis;
  NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; AGS,
  altered gene sets; FGS, functional gene sets; DEGs, differentially expressed genes;
  FDR, false discovery rate.'
