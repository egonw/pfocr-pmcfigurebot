caption: 'SGs promote the progression of ICC by activating the NF‐kB signaling pathway.
  A) Changes in NF‐κB pathway after E. coli stimulation, as observed by Western blot
  experiment. Quantification of Western blot analysis is shown on the right (n = 3).
  B) Changes in the NF‐κB pathway when cGLIS3 is overexpressed or knocked down in
  Western Blot experiment in the Hccc9810 and HuccT1 cells. Quantification of Western
  blot analysis is shown on the right (n = 3). C) Effect of pretreated with E. coli
  or PBS on IKKα mRNA translation level of the ICC cells based on RNC sequencing.
  D) Upper: Immunofluorescence analysis of IKKα mRNA and G3BP1 in HuccT1 cells pretreated
  with E. coli upon PBS, TPCA, anti‐IL6, and ICA. Nuclei are stained with DAPI. Scale
  bar, 10 µm. Below: Curves of fluorescence intensities of the position marked by
  a white square in the merged image. E) Upper: Immunofluorescence analysis of IKKα
  mRNA and G3BP1 in Hccc9810 cells pretreated with E. coli upon PBS, TPCA, anti‐IL6,
  and ICA. Nuclei are stained with DAPI. Scale bar, 10 µm. Below: Curves of fluorescence
  intensities of the position marked by a white square in the merged image. F) Effect
  of PBS, TPCA, anti‐IL6, and ICA changes on cGLIS3 expression level in Hccc9810 and
  HuccT1 cells, as shown by the qPCR experiment (n = 3). G,H) Effect of PBS, TPCA,
  anti‐IL6, and ICA on the metastatic ability of Hccc9810 and HuccT1 cells after pretreatment
  with E. coli, as demonstrated by a 3D migration experiment. Quantification of migration
  is shown on the right image (n = 3). I) Proliferative ability of gemcitabine‐treated
  Hccc9810 and HuccT1 cells with different interventions was investigated using colony
  formation assays. Representative colony formation images are shown. Numbers of colonies
  are summarized on the right (n = 3). J) Effect of ICA on the NF‐κB pathway of Hccc9810
  and HuccT1cells after pretreatment with E. coli, as demonstrated by Western blot
  analysis. Quantification of Western blot is shown on the right image (n = 3). (A,B,F,G–J)
  For bar and line graphs, data represent mean ± SEM. (F,G–I) One‐way ANOVA with Tukey''s
  post‐hoc test (A,B,J) Two‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni''s post‐hoc test. NS indicates
  no significance; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.'
