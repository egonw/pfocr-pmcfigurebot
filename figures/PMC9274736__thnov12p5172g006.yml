caption: 'Pharmacological inhibition of S1pr2 by JTE013 improves post-ischemic angiogenesis
  and enhances blood flow perfusion in hindlimbs. A, Representative laser Doppler
  images show improved blood flow perfusion in JTE013-treated mice compared with control
  mice. B, Cumulative results for control mice (n = 6) and JTE-treated mice (n = 6)
  are shown graphically as the ratio of blood flow in the ischemic limb to that in
  the non-ischemic limb at each time point. C-D, Representative images of isolectin-B4
  staining of gastrocnemius muscles in control mice and JTE013-treated mice, with
  quantification of capillary density in gastrocnemius muscles after sham or HLI operation
  (n = 5). E-F, Representative images of α-SMA staining of gastrocnemius muscles in
  control mice and JTE013-treated mice (E), with quantification of arteriole density
  in gastrocnemius muscles after sham or HLI operation (F) (n = 5). G-H, Representative
  images of H&E staining of gastrocnemius muscles in control mice and JTE013-treated
  mice (G), with quantification of muscle fiber area after sham or HLI operation (H)
  (n = 5). I-J, Representative images of Sirius red-stained of gastrocnemius muscles
  in control mice and JTE013-treated mice (I), with quantification of the percentage
  of fibrotic tissue in muscle (J) (n = 5). K-M, Functional assessment of ischemic
  muscle over follow-up. Cumulative results for control mice and JTE013-treated mice
  are shown graphically as Tarlov score (K), ischemia score (L), and ambulatory impairment
  score (M) (n = 6). N-P, Western blotting of AKT or eNOS activation status in hindlimbs
  of mice treated with JTE013 or DMSO and quantification in the indicated groups (n
  = 4). Scale Bars: C and E, 50 μm; G and I,100 μm. Data are mean ± SEM. n.s indicates
  not significant. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.'
