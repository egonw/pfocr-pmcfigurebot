caption: Propranolol mitigates stress-induced stomach pathological changes. (A) Histological
  changes in gastric tissues were determined via H&E staining (magnification, ×400;
  scale bar, 200 µm). A large number of goblet cells (black arrow) in the DD group
  and atypical cells (with numerous mitotic phases; indicated by the brown arrow)
  in the DR group were observed. (B) Gross changes to the stomach (scale bar, 3 mm).
  DD, detrimental diet group; DR, detrimental diet with chronic restraint group; DRP,
  detrimental diet with chronic restraint and propranolol treatment group.
article_title: Chronic restraint stress promotes gastric epithelial malignant transformation
  by activating the Akt/p53 signaling pathway via ADRB2.
