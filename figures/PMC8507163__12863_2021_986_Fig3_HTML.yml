caption: Results of miRNA set enrichment analysis in COPD and NSCLC for non-small
  cell lung cancer, cell cycle, and p53 signaling pathways. MiRSEA performs differential
  expression analysis for miRNAs based on differential weighted scores (a); integrates
  the differential expression level of miRNAs and miRNA-pathway weights, calculates
  miRScore, and creates a ranked list of miRNAs. Then, it maps miRNAs in the pathway
  to the ranked list and calculates the miRNA enrichment score for each pathway and
  miRNA correlation profiles (b); after calculating the enrichment score, MiRSEA prioritizes
  a pathway by FDR and the running miRNAs enrichment score for the pathway results
