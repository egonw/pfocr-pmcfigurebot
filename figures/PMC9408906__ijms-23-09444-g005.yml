caption: Extracellular ATP is the mediator released by the mechanical stimulation
  of osteoclasts that leads to protein synthesis in FDB muscle when they are co-cultured.
  The experimental model of Transwell® chambers was used, as detailed in . (A) Measuring
  of eATP in the lower chamber, after mechanical stimulation of osteoclasts cultured
  at the upper compartment. This experiment was performed without any muscle in the
  lower compartment. Extracellular ATP was measured in the cell media (n = 3). (B)
  In an indirect co-culture system, with osteoclasts in the upper chamber and isolated
  FDB in the lower chamber, mechanical stimulation of osteoclasts leads to protein
  synthesis in FDB muscles. The latter was prevented by 30-min pre-incubation with
  2 U/mL Apyrase (Apy, an ectonucleotidase that metabolizes extracellular ATP), 100
  µM Suramin (Sura, P2Y/P2X receptor antagonist), 50 µM LY294002 (LY, PI3-kinase inhibitor)
  or 100 nM Rapamycin (Rapa, mTOR inhibitor). Osteoclasts were mechanically stimulated
  by pipetting 37% of the extracellular medium at the upper compartment, ten times.
  Protein synthesis was addressed at the FDB muscle by puromycin incorporation. Puromycin
  immunoblot (top) and its quantification (bottom) are shown. Mean ± SEM of 3–4 independent
  experiments is graphed. *** p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney test comparing control (undisturbed)
  with mechanical stimulation.
