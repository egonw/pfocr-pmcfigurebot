caption: 'Effect of Sal B on iopromide-induced ROS generation and loss of ΔΨm. (a)
  Compared with the iopromide-treated group, Sal B lowered the decrease in ROS generation.
  (b, c) Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD.
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group. (d) ΔΨm levels in
  iopromide-treated cells were lower than those in the control cells. However, Sal
  B increased the ΔΨm level, indicating that it had a protective effect on iopromide-induced
  acute kidney injury. (e, f) Similar results were obtained using flow cytometry.
  n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  vs. iopromide group.'
