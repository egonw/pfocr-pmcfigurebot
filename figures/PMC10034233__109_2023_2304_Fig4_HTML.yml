caption: Mimic infection of SARS-COV-2 induces down-regulation of RAS and PDGFs in
  cells. The mRNA level of ACE2 (A–B), the ratio of ACE2/ACE (C–D), the mRNA of genes
  related to classical RAS pathway (E–F), the mRNA level of PDGFs family (G–H) and
  its downstream genes (I–J) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. BSA was used as a control;
  S1 represents recombinant SARS-COV-2 Spike S1 (S1 Subunit) protein; RBD represents
  recombinant Spike Protein (RBD). N = 3 cases per group. Data represent means ± S.E.M;
  biological replicates. p < 0.05*, p < 0.01** and p < 0.001 *** by one-way ANOVA
  followed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test
