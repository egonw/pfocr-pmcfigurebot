caption: TSG-6 mRNA expression in ASCs indirectly cocultured with macrophages. ASCs
  were indirectly cocultured with macrophages for 2 days and TSG-6 mRNA expression
  assessed by qPCR. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. GAPDH expression
  was used for normalization. The 2−(ΔΔCt) method was used to calculate relative fold
  changes in mRNA expression. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD) of three independent experiments. ** p ≤ 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. M0, macrophages
  differentiated from THP-1 monocytes; M1, M0 macrophages treated with IFN-γ and LPS;
  M2, M0 macrophages treated with IL-4 and IL-13.
