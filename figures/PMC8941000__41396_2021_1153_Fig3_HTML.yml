figure_title: Metabolic potential of the OMM12 strains
caption: (A) OMM12metabolic models were reconstructed using gapseq [] and gapseq output
  was screened for a hand-curated set of pathways to determine the strains’ potential
  to use a diverse range of substrate-specific and central pathways and release fermentation
  end products. Multiple pathways corresponding to the same function were grouped
  together according to the MetaCyc pathway database [] (SI data table ) and pathway
  utilization was considered positive (green) if one of the associated pathways was
  confirmed by gapseq. If none of the associated pathways were found, the potential
  substrate and pathway utilization was considered negative (grey). Metabolites and
  pathways were sorted by functional groups. By combining metabolomics data (MS, Fig. ,
  ) with genome-based information, broad-scale metabolic sketches of the individual
  OMM12 strains were generated (Fig. ). Here, the models for strains B. caecimuris
  I48 (B) and B. coccoides YL58 (C) are shown exemplarily. Models of the remaining
  strains of the consortium are shown in Fig. . Experimentally confirmed substrates
  and products and pathways found by gapseq are shown in black. Hypothetical substrates,
  products, or pathways are shown in grey.
