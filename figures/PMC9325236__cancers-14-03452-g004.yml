caption: Potential therapeutic interventions based on the EML4-ALK V3/NEK9/NEK7 pathway.
  A cartoon illustrating how NEK9 is recruited to the microtubule network by EML4-ALK
  V3 and further recruits NEK7 forming the EML4-ALK V3/NEK9/NEK7 complex. The complex
  promotes increased cytoplasmic protrusions and enhanced migration in cells and potentially
  accelerated metastasis in patients. The use of targeted agents against the catalytic
  activities of NEK9 or NEK7, or that prevent assembly or microtubule recruitment
  of the complex, could potentially reverse these phenotypes.
