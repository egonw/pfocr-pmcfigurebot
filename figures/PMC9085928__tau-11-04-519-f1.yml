caption: The public database shows that DHT treatment inhibits SPC25 in prostate cancer
  LNCap cells. The GSE187413 data set comprised LNCap cells treated with a control
  vehicle or DHT. (A) A pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape,
  and showed that many of the pathways related to cell-cycle control were significantly
  affected by DHT. (B,C) The significantly altered genes are shown in the volcano
  map (B) and the heat map (C). SPC25 was significantly reduced by DHT treatment.
  DHT, dihydrotestosterone; SPC25, spindle pole body component 25.
