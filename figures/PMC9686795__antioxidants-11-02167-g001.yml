caption: PINK1 accumulates on the OMM of damaged mitochondria, followed by recruitment
  and phosphorylation of Parkin which ubiquitinates OMM proteins such as the translocase
  of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20) and mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2). The
  pre-initiation complex containing ULK1 (Unc 51-like kinase 1), Atg (autophagy related
  proteins) 13 and 101 and FIP200 (focal adhesion kinase family interacting partner
  200) is activated, followed by recruitment of phosphatidyl inositide 3 kinase (PI3K),
  Atg14, beclin 1, AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1), vascular sorting proteins
  Vsp34 and 15, and LC3 (light chain 3) leading to generation of phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate
  (PI3P). The ubiquitinated OMM proteins recruit autophagy adaptor proteins (NRB1—neighbor
  of BRCA1 gene 1 protein, optineurin, TAX1BP1—Tax 1 binding protein 1, NDP52—nuclear
  dot protein 52, p62), which interact with LC3 leading to closure of the of the phagophore
  and formation of the autophagosome. Rab7, a lysosome-associated small GTPase, LRRK2
  (leucine rich repeat kinase 2) and LAMP2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2)
  mediate fusion of the autophagosomes with lysosomes. In AD, Aβ can be internalized
  by mitochondria via TOM, damaging the organelle, while cytoplasmic Aβ decreases
  the levels of PINK1 and parkin, thereby impairing the mitophagy pathway.
