caption: Developed the pre-neoplastic lesions were observed in all animals which received
  the carcinogen. The control group didn’t show any ACs, ACF and CM. Only in the DMH
  group, the mean ± SEM of ACs, ACF and CM was 4.32 ± 0.18, 18.36 ± 0.79 and 4.25 ± 0.05,
  respectively. All intervention treatment groups which received pre-treatment and
  post-treatment of SO extract showed a significant reduction in the mean ± SEM of
  ACs, ACF and CM compared with DMH group (P < 0.001). The least number of AC, ACF,
  and CM was observed in the post-treatment group treated with 100 mg/kg. Post-treatment
  groups showed significant (P < 0.01) response in reducing ACs, ACF, and CM compared
  with pre-treatment groups (,  and ).
