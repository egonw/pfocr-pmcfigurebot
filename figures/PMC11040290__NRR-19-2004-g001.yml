caption: 'Galectin-3 (Gal3) and its pleiotropic functions.(A) Gal3 is composed of
  a carbohydrate-binding domain that binds to β-galactoside sugars, and an N-terminal
  tail that is a site for phosphorylation and sites of cleavage for metalloproteases.
  (B) Gal3 can be released into the extracellular space by macrophages and monocytes
  where it can interact with interferon (IFN)-γ to immune cell infiltration. (C) Pentameric
  oligomerization of Gal3 crosslinks with cell surface receptors to promote membrane
  protein reorganizations and receptor lattice formation. (D) Through binding to CD44
  and MerTK, Gal3 modulates endocytic activities and phagocytosis. (E) Gal3 mediates
  inflammatory cytokine production by activating nuclear factor-kB pathway through
  integrin-linked kinase (ILK) or by activating JAK-STAT signaling via IFN-γ receptor
  1 (IFNGR1). (F) Gal3 facilitates cell proliferation through Akt-mTORC1, RAS, Notch-Jag1,
  or insulin-growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. (G) Intracellular Gal3 binding to liposaccharide
  (LPS) promotes inflammasome and caspase activation, as well as (H) mTORC1 activation
  via Rag GTPases and Ragulato. Created with BioRender.com. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide;
  MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor κB.'
