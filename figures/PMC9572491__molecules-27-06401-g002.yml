caption: A schematic representation depicting the molecular pathways with the biomarkers
  of caspase-independent programmed cell death pathway. [Mitochondria is the main
  regulator which initiates number of events. In response to a stimulus, Bax, the
  pro-apoptotic protein, translocates to the mitochondrion. This translocation is
  controlled by cathepsins and calpains activity. Cathepsins are released from the
  lysosomes and calpains are activated by endoplasmic reticulum ER stress induced
  Ca2+ influx in the cell. Cathepsins and calpains also cause cleavage and translocation
  of Bid to the mitochondrion and cleavage of AIF. The presence of Bax and cleaved
  Bid at the mitochondrial membrane induces mitochondrial depolarization, thereby
  causing increased membrane permeability, which, in turn, causes the release of cleaved
  AIF (sAIF) and Smac/DIABLO. sAIF translocates to the nucleus where it, jointly with
  endonuclease G, induces chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation of high molecular
  weight fragments of ~50 kb].
