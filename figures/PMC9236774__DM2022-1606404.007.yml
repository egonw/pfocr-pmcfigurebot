caption: 'Siglec-15 silencing inhibits tumor growth and strengthen immune via inhibiting
  of activation of STAT1/STAT3 signaling pathway. (a) Representative image of subcutaneous
  tumors isolated from nude mice at the experimental endpoint. Quantitative analysis
  of tumor volumes (b) and tumor weight (c) of the indicated cell xenografts at the
  indicated time points. (d) Tumor tissue sections from the indicated cell xenografts
  were prepared and proceeded for H&E staining and anti-Ki-67 and anti-VEGF immunostaining.
  (e) flow cytometry analysis of the ratio CD4+/CD8+. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ##p < 0.01 indicated
  statistical significance compared with control group or Siglec-15 RNAi group.'
