caption: 'A) Tumor adenosine level changes after PTT treatment (48 °C, 10 min) as
  detected by high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Normal: normal tissue;
  Tumor: tumor without treatment; n = 3. B) CD73 expression before and after PTT treatment
  in vivo detected by flow cytometry, n = 6. C) Schematic illustration of the negative
  feedback of adenosine‐A2AR metabolic pathway in PTT‐induced ICD. Data are expressed
  as the means ± SD. Statistical significance is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 and ns represents no significant difference.'
