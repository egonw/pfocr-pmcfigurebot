caption: The H3K9 methylation pathway is essential for progression to antiandrogen
  resistance. (A–C) Immunoblots showing the expression of ectopically expressed H3K9
  methyltransferases (A), proliferation analysis (B), and crystal violet-stained representative
  images (C) of LNCaP cells that were lentivirally transduced to overexpress the H3K9
  methyltransferases after treatment with Enz (10 µM) or DMSO (Veh). Cells in the
  Enz group were pretreated with Enz for 21 d before seeding. (D–F) Immunoblots (D),
  cell growth analysis (E), and representative crystal violet stained images (F) of
  LNCaP cells that were lentivirally transduced to express guide RNAs targeting the
  indicated H3K9 methyltransferase or a nontargeting control gRNA. (E and F) Enz group
  cells were pretreated with Enz (10 µM) for 28 d before seeding at 105 and 2 × 105/well
  for Veh and Enz treatments, respectively. (G) Kaplan–Meier plots of estimated survival
  time based on the transcript levels of SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 in mCRPC tumor biopsies
  from SU2C (n = 158) and RMH (n = 94) cohorts. P values were calculated from a Cox
  proportional hazards model to determine differences in outcome between patients
  with high (above median = orange) and low (below median = blue) expression. On the
  Right, patients were placed in one of four groups based on high or low expression
  of SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 combined. (H–J) Immunoblots showing CBX knockout efficacy
  by CRISPR (H), cell growth as monitored by IncuCyte live cell imaging (I), and representative
  crystal violet stained images (J) of LNCaP cells that were lentivirally transduced
  to express sgRNAs, targeting the indicated CBX proteins or a nontargeting control
  sgRNA, as indicated in H. Results represent mean ± SEM, n = 3; significance was
  determined using an unpaired t test. Enz cells in H were pretreated with Enz (10
  µM) for 90 d before initiation of the experiment. Cells were seeded at 105 and 2
  × 105/well for Veh and Enz treatments, respectively. (K) Tumor growth and (L) progression-free
  survival analyses of subcutaneous xenografts established from LNCaP cells that were
  lentivirally transduced to express sgRNAs targeting CBX3, CBX5, or a nontargeting
  (control) sgRNA, as indicated, and engrafted into surgically orchiectomized NSG
  mice supplemented with DHEA pellets to mimic human physiology and treated with Enz
  or control chow.
