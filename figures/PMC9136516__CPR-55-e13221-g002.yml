caption: FGF6 promotes CMs cell cycle re‐entry in vivo. (A) Representative immunofluorescence
  (green for Ki‐67, red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) and quantitative analysis the number
  of Ki‐67 positive cardiomyocytes in different group mice heart sections, white arrow
  indicates positive cell. Scale bar =40 μm. n = 5 per group. (B) Representative immunofluorescence
  (green for EdU, red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) and quantitative analysis the number
  of EdU positive cardiomyocytes in different group mice heart sections, white arrow
  indicates positive cell. Scale bar =40 μm. n = 5 per group. (C) Representative immunofluorescence
  (green for Aurora B, red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) and quantitative analysis the
  number of Aurora B positive cardiomyocytes in different group mice heart sections,
  white arrow indicates positive cell. Scale bar = 40 μm. n = 4 per group. (D) WGA
  staining was performed to detect cardiomyocytes cross sectional areas in different
  group mice heart sections. Scale bar = 40 μm. n = 5 per group. (E) Quantitative
  analysis the number of Ki‐67 positive cardiomyocytes in (A), the number of EdU positive
  cardiomyocytes in (B), the number of Aurora B positive cardiomyocytes in (C) and
  the cardiomyocytes cross sectional areas in (D). (F) Western blot was performed
  to determine the protein levels of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1 and PCNA in the heart of
  different group mice. n >4 per group. (G) Quantitative analysis the expressions
  of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1 and PCNA in (E). Data represent means ± SEM. Two‐tailed
  Student's t test. *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p <0.001
