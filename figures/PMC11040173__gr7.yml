caption: Iron overload inhibited the Notch signaling pathway. Iron overload mice model
  was established by intraperitoneal injection of 120 mg/kg body weight of iron dextran
  once a fortnight for 12 weeks. The mediums of mouse enteroids were added same amount
  of normal saline (Control), 3 mM FAC or 10 mM FAC. (A–B) The mRNA expression levels
  of Notch related proteins (Dll1, Dll4, Notch1, RBP-Jκ, Hes1 and Atoh1) in the duodenum
  (n = 5) and mouse enteroids (n = 3). (C) Representative immunoblot and quantitative
  analysis showing the expression level of Notch1, NICD, RBP-Jκ and Atoh1 in the duodenum
  (n = 3). (D–E) Representative images of Notch1 and NICD by immunofluorescence (Upper
  panel: × 100 magnification. Lower panel: × 400 magnification). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01
  compared with the control group.

  systemic iron overload stress are associated with inhibition of Notch signaling
