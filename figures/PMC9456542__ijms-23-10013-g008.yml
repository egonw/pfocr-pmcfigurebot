caption: A schematic representation of m6A-mediated adaptation of P. xylostella to
  host plants. After the WT strain was transferred from AD to feed on radish seedlings,
  m6A modification occurred on certain sites of mRNA transcripts. This may result
  in expression regulation of the genes related to adaptation to host plant defense
  and nutritional stress through the steroid biosynthesis pathway; however, this may
  also result in energy reallocation through the metabolic pathway and at the expense
  of adult reproduction. Therefore, although the WT larval performance on the host
  plant was not significantly affected, WT adult reproduction was significantly reduced.
  Due to the lack of methyltransferase (s), the mutant strains could not regulate
  gene expression through m6A modification. Therefore, the mutant larval performance
  on the host plant was significantly impaired, while the mutant adult reproduction
  was not as affected as WT. Larvae of different sizes are proportional to their weights.
  Downward arrows indicate the downregulation of gene expression, and dotted arrows
  indicate reduced stress adaptability. The solid circle indicates the 5′ cap structure
  of mRNA, and “(A)n” indicates the 3′ polyA tail.
