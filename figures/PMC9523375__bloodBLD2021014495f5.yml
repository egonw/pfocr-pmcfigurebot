caption: 'Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling of T-cell subpopulations in mice cured
  of or relapsed with BCR-ABL1 B-ALL after dasatinib therapy. (A,B) Uniform manifold
  approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization of 14â€‰836 individual peripheral
  blood leukocytes collected from cured (7578 single cells) (A) and relapsed mice
  (7258 single cells) (B). (C) Each cell was classified into 1 of 5 immune cell types
  based on the expression of marker genes. (D) The difference in immune cell composition
  is shown as the percentage of peripheral blood leukocytes in cured mice relative
  to relapsed mice. (E,F) Flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells showed a higher
  proportion of CD3 (E) and CD4 (F) T cells in cured mice compared with relapsed animals.
  (G) Single-cell expression of marker genes of the T-cell population. Memory T-cell
  markers: Tcf7, Sell, Ccf7, and Il7r. Effector T-cell markers: Ifng, Gzma, Gzmb,
  and Pdcd1. NK T-cell markers: Klra1 and Xcl1. (H-J) UMAP visualization of T cells
  collected from cured and relapsed mice. Each cell was classified into 1 of 4 subpopulations
  based on the expression of marker genes; 4 subpopulations (H); distribution of cells
  from cured mice (green) and relapsed mice (brown) (I); T-cell distribution of 4
  subpopulation in cured (left) or relapsed (right) groups, respectively (J). (K,L)
  To identify genes related to ALL cure, we compared gene expression profiles of T
  cells from cured mice vs relapsed mice and specifically focused on CD8 T1 cells
  (memory like) (K) and CD8 T2 cells (effector like) (L). Differentially expressed
  genes were analyzed for pathway enrichment using GSEA. The bar plot shows the normalized
  enrichment scores of gene sets.'
