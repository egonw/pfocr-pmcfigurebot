figure_title: 2-AG signaling inhibits nuclear translocation of DAF-16 induced by cholesterol
  depletion
caption: (A) DAF-16::GFP nuclear translocation group classification. Translocation
  categories were placed into 3 classes as shown in the picture. Animals which exhibited
  DAF-16::GFP nuclear accumulation between 0–10% of total DAF-16::GFP were classified
  as Low Translocation (LowT), 30–50% as Middle Translocation (MiddleT) and 70–90%,
  High Translocation (HighT). All animals shown are in a L2 larva stage. (B) Nuclear
  translocation of DAF-16::GFP in worms grown under normal cholesterol concentration
  (CHOL) and after cholesterol depletion for two generations in the absence (solvent)
  or presence of 2-AG. 69 individual worms were analyzed for the solvent condition,
  66 for 2-AG and 64 for CHOL.
