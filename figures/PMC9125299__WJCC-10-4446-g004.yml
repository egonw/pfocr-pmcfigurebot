caption: 'Protein–protein interaction network of differentially expressed genes with
  prognostic value. Interacting nodes are displayed in colored circles using Search
  Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes v10.0. A: Low-density lipoprotein receptor
  only involved in cholesterol metabolism pathway; B: FDXR was also involved in xenobiotic
  metabolic processes, cellular responses to xenobiotic stimuli and oxidation–reduction
  processes; C: ABCA1 was shown to be involved in the steroid hormone-mediated signaling
  pathway; D: OSBPL1A was involved in antigen processing and presentation of exogenous
  peptide antigens via MHC class II, microtubule-based movement and vesicle-mediated
  transport.'
