figure_title: ATM-dependent expression of mTOR and AKT signaling is not unique to
  leukemic cells
caption: Analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
  (GSE61019). Level of MTOR mRNAs from human brain tissues of A-T cases were compared
  with those from control samples (left) and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) enrichment
  plots of mTORC1 signaling and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling are shown.
article_title: Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated
  by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation.
