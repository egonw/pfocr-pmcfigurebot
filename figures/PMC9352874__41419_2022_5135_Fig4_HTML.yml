figure_title: NXN suppressed EMT and decreased Snail protein stability
caption: A Differential expression of NXN affects cell morphology. Phase-contrast
  images (× 200) of indicated HCC cells. Scale bar, 50 µm. B Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) of transcriptome data in the TCGA database revealed that levels of NXN were
  negatively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). NES, normalized
  enrichment score; FDR, false-discovery rate. C Western blot revealed that NXN negatively
  regulated the protein expression of mesenchymal markers in HCC cells. D Quantitative
  real-time PCR analysis showed that NXN expression did not affect the mRNA levels
  of transcription factors (Fibronectin, ZEB1 and Snail). Data were presented as the
  mean ± SD. Ns, no statistical significance. E The down-regulation of NXN in HCC
  activated the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis signaling pathway. Top 20 statistics
  of KEGG pathway enrichment based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after
  NXN knockdown in Hep3B cells. In the scatter plot, RichFactor was the ratio of DEG
  numbers noted in this pathway term to all gene numbers noted in this pathway term,
  indicating intensiveness. P-value ranges from 0 to 1, and a lower P-value represents
  greater intensity. The ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis signaling pathway was one
  of the most regulated biofunctions upon NXN knockdown. F The half-life of Snail
  in Huh7 with NXN knockdown was significantly prolonged compared to control cells.
  The half-life of Snail in NXN overexpressed PLC-8024 cells was markedly reduced
  compared to control cells. The cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) at indicated
  times; then, Snail levels were analyzed by Western blot. G Downregulation of Snail
  in NXN overexpressed Huh7 and PLC-8024 cells were restored after the treatment of
  proteasome inhibitor (MG132). H NXN overexpression enhanced ubiquitination of Snail
  in 293 T, PLC-8024 and Huh7 cells.
