figure_title: RIP140-deficient CMs exhibit hypertrophy and activation of the mTORC1
  signaling pathway
caption: '(A) Representative images of isolated CMs from 8- to 10-week-old male csNrip1–/–
  (csKO) and WT (Control) mouse hearts. Scale bars: 50 μm. Graphs show quantification
  of CM size (n = 3 per group, 100 cells per sample). (B) Representative immunoblots
  of mTORC1 signaling targets S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1 from 10- to 13-week-old
  male control and csKO hearts. Graphs show quantification of immunoblots in normalized
  AU (n = 4 per group). (C) Representative immunoblots of mTORC1 signaling targets
  S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1 from male strNrip1–/– (strKO) and WT (Control) mouse
  hearts following PWAB or sham surgery. Graphs show quantification of immunoblots
  in normalized AU (n = 4 per group). Values are the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 versus
  control, by 2-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test (A and B) or 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple-comparison test (C). p, phosphorylated.'
