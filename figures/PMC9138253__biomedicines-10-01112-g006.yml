caption: Interaction between Src and Wnt signaling pathway. With Wnt stimulation,
  Src associates with LRP5/6 and ROR1/2 receptors and is activated. In addition, Src
  binding to Disheveled ensures Src activation and Src in turn phosphorylates Tyr18,
  27, and 275 of Dishevelled, contributing to Wnt signaling. Furthermore, Src phosphorylates
  Fzd at Tyr552 to stimulate Wnt signaling. However, LRP5/6 Tyr1460 phosphorylation
  by Src leads to a negative regulation of Wnt signaling. In particular, Src phosphorylates
  β-catenin Tyr333, facilitating a nuclear translocation along with association with
  PKM2. Remarkably, p-Ser9 GSK-3β, which is induced by ROCK1, is able to phosphorylate
  Src at Ser493 and Ser51, leading to Src inactivation while phosphorylating in certain
  circumstances at Ser43, leading to its activation.
