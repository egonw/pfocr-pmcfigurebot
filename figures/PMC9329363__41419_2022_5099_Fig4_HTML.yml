figure_title: ARHGEF2 promoted proliferation of HCC in vivo and in vitro
caption: A, B ARHGEF2 expression levels were confirmed by Western Blot (A) and qRT-PCR
  (B) after ARHGEF2 knockdown in the HepG2 cell line. C, D The proliferation of shNC
  and shARHGEF2 groups of the HepG2 cells was detected by CCK-8 (C) and clone formation
  assay (D). E–G Tumors from mice in shNC and shARHGEF2 groups (F), tumor volumes
  (E) and weights (G) were measured. H HE staining and IHC staining of ARHGEF2 and
  Ki67 indices were performed on the tumors of shNC and shARHGEF2 groups. I, J ARHGEF2
  expression levels were detected by Western Blot (I) and qRT-PCR (J) after ARHGEF2
  overexpression in the MHCC97H cell line. K, L CCK-8 (K) and clone formation assay
  (L) were used to detect the proliferation of Vector and ARHGEF2 groups of MHCC97H
  cells. M–O Tumors from mice in Vector and ARHGEF2 groups (N), tumor volumes (M)
  and weights (O) were measured. P HE staining and IHC staining on the tumors of Vector
  and ARHGEF2 groups.
