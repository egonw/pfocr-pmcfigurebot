caption: Identification of differential metabolites in KO cells. (A) Structural composition
  of differential metabolites. The composition and quantity distribution of the top
  three metabolites are displayed. (B,C) Functional annotation of amino acids, peptides,
  and analogues metabolites. Metabolite enrichment showed that aminoacyl-tRNA was
  the most severely affected, and all the detected metabolites were downregulated
  in the aminoacyl-tRNA pathway. (D) The altered glycerophosphocholine is mainly PE,
  LysoPE, LysoPC, and PC. Metabolites in this classification were both up- and downregulated
  in the cell, with upregulation predominating. On this heatmap, each box represents
  one substance, with red and blue representing up- and downregulation, respectively,
  and the darker the color, the greater the difference.
