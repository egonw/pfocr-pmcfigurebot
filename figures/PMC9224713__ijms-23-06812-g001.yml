caption: Classification of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different discharge mechanisms.
  (1) Exosomes are made by endocytosis pathway, and discharged via exocytosis at a
  diameter of “30–200 nm”. (2) Plasma membrane budding forms the microvesicles (MVs),
  and they vary in diameter from 100 to 1000 nm. (3) With a size above 1000 nm, apoptotic
  bodies are discharged from the cell membrane by blebbing processes. Created with
