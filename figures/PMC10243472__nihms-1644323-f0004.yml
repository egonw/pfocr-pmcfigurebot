figure_title: Figure 4.Metabolic Profiles with LV Unloading
caption: A) Principal component analysis for IR, TV-P or ECMO activation before reperfusion;
  B) Heatmap of metabolite levels for sham, IR, TV-P, or ECMO across metabolic super-pathways;
  C) Enrichment pathway analysis comparing IR and TV-P; D) Illustration and bar-graphs
  showing levels of representative metabolites for glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation,
  and the citric acid cycle. All analyses were performed on tissue isolated from the
  infarct zone after reperfusion.
