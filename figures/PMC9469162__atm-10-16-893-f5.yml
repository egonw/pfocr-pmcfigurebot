caption: 'MiR-195-5p regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting FOSL1.
  (A, B) Western blotting was used to detect changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  proteins in GBC-SD and NOZ cells after transfection with miR-195-5p mimics and inhibitor
  or NC. (C, D) Western blotting was used to detect changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway proteins in stable GBC-SD and NOZ cell lines after transfection. (E, F)
  Immunofluorescence staining of β-catenin in stable GBC-SD and NOZ cell lines after
  transfection (original magnification, ×200). Data are mean ± SD. GBC-SD: *P<0.05
  compared with control group; #P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + oe-FOSL1 group. NOZ:
  *P<0.05 compared with control group; #P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + sh-FOSL1 #1
  group; &P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + sh-FOSL1 #2 group. The experiment was repeated
  3 times. oe-NC, overexpress negative control; oe-FOSL1, overexpress Fos-like antigen-1;
  sh-FOSL1, short hairpin Fos-like antigen-1; sh-NC, short hairpin negative control;
  SD, standard deviation.'
