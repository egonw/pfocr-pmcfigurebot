caption: STAT3 signaling is the downstream of UBE2T in retinoblastoma cells. (A) JAK-STAT
  pathway was enriched (red arrow) in the si-NC group compared with siUBE2T-1 group
  in Y79 cell line by KEGG pathway analysis. (B) GSEA plot showing that UBE2T expression
  positively correlated with JAK-STAT gene signatures. (C, D) The expression of STAT3
  and p-STAT3 were measured by Western blotting in the UBE2T silenced cells. (E, F)
  The Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, c-Myc, and p21 production in UBE2T knockdown Y79 and Weri-Rb-1
  cells, respectively.
