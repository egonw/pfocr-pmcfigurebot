caption: The effect of γ-PGA on the appearance of maize roots, IAA content in roots
  and rhizosphere soil, and urease activity of rhizosphere soil. A Phenotypes of maize
  after γ-PGA (10 kDa, 50 mg/L) and L-Glu (50 mg/L) treatment. B The primary root
  length of maize with γ-PGA, L-Glu treatment, and control maize (CK). C-E The seminal
  root, crown root and lateral root number of maize with γ-PGA, L-Glu treatment, and
  control maize (CK). F-H The total seminal root, crown root and total root length
  of maize with γ-PGA, L-Glu treatment, and control maize (CK). I The fresh weight
  of maize roots with γ-PGA, L-Glu treatment, and control maize (CK). Values are means
  ± sd (n = 5 repeats). Significant differences are indicated by different letters
  (P ≤ 0.01)
