caption: The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of isorhamnetin on Alzheimer's
  disease. Aβ oligomers activate microglia to secrete IL-6, which further upregulates
  the TYK2/STAT1 pathway to increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  impair neurite outgrowth, and upregulate apoptosis on neurons (neuroinflammation).
  Isorhamnetin attenuates microglial activation and IL-6 secretion and downregulates
  the TYK2/STAT1 pathway to reduce IL-6-mediated neuroinflammation.

  Microglia and Mitigated Interleukin-6-Mediated Neurotoxicity.
