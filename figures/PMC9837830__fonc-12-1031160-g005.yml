caption: RNF128 ubiquitinates MST for degradation and regulates target genes of the
  Hippo signaling pathway. (A) Co-IP assays revealed that RNF128 interacts with MST.
  (B) An IP assay was used to examine the ubiquitination levels of MST. HCT116 cells
  were treated with MG132 (10 μM) for 6 h after transfection with si-NC and si-RNF128
  for 48 h. (C, D) The expression levels of HIF-1α, Bcl-2, p-IκBα and IκBα were examined
  by western blotting. HCT116 cells were transfected with si-NC and si-RNF128 and
  treated with verteporfin (1 μM) for 16 h and PY-60 (10 μM) for 24 h. **P<0.001.
