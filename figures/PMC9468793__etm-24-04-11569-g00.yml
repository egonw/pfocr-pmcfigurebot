caption: 'Effect of Cit on LPS-induced lung injury. (A) Cell count and (B) protein
  concentration in BALF. (C) Lung W/D ratio. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
  error of the mean (n=6). **P<0.01 vs. con; ##P<0.01 vs. LPS. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  Con, control; Cit, citrulline; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; W/D, wet/dry.'
article_title: Citrulline protects against LPS‑induced acute lung injury by inhibiting
  ROS/NLRP3‑dependent pyroptosis and apoptosis via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
