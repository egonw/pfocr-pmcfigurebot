caption: 'Proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons. (a) Principle component analysis
  (PCA) plot of the proteome of the samples analyzed: WT FUS-eGFP treated with DMSO,
  P525L FUS-eGFP treated with DMSO, and P525L FUS-eGFP treated with obatoclax at 10
  nM for 24 h. Three independent experiments. See also . (b) Volcano plot of the comparison
  between WT FUS-eGFP treated with DMSO and P525L FUS-eGFP treated with DMSO. (c)
  Volcano plot of the comparison between P525L FUS treated with DMSO and P525L FUS-eGFP
  treated with obatoclax at 10 nM for 24 h. (d) Differentially expressed proteins
  related to the proteasome pathway. Proteasome subunit alpha type-1 (PSMA1, p = 0.000103),
  proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1, p = 0.000251), proteasome activator
  complex subunit 2 (PSME2, p = 0.000132), and proteasome activator complex subunit
  3 (PSME3, p = 0.000054) are downregulated in P525L FUS-eGFP compared with WT FUS-eGFP.
  (e) Differentially expressed proteins related to the mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis
  pathway. Lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3GAL1, p = 0.005826) and
  beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5 (B4GALT5, p = 0.000386) are upregulated in P525L
  FUS-eGFP treated with obatoclax compared with P525L FUS-eGFP treated with DMSO.
  (f) Proteins related to endocytic trafficking. EH domain-containing protein 4 (EHD4,
  0.000021) and AP-1 complex subunit sigma-2 (AP1S1, p = 0.004056) are upregulated
  in P525L FUS-eGFP treated with obatoclax compared with P525L FUS-eGFP treated with
  DMSO. (g) MRG/MORF4L-binding protein (MRGBP, p = 0.000154) related to DNA double-strand
  break repair. (h) DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 9 (DNAJC9, p = 0.001442) related
  to histone chaperone network and heat shock-induced response. Related to .'
