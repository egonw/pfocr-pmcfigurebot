caption: 'KEGG pathways and their Fold Enrichment at FDR < 0.05 using a list of the:
  (a) 100 ng/L group upregulated genes, (b) 1 mg/L group upregulated genes, and (c)
  the 1 mg/L group downregulated genes. The analysis was carried using DEGs at p <
  0.1 and log2-fold change > 1. The Fold Enrichment was calculated as the percentage
  of differentially expressed genes for each group belonging to a pathway, divided
  by the corresponding percentage of genes in the background. FDR is calculated based
  on nominal p-value from the hypergeometric test []. (Note: Only top 40 pathways
  of 56 are displayed for the 1 mg/L upregulated gene list. For the complete list
  see ).'
