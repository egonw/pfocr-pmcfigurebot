caption: 'Stable isotope labeling experiments. A, Layout of the in vivo stable isotope
  labeling experiment. B, Conceptualization of the labeled precursor feeding experiments
  showing the different pools of labeled and unlabeled p-coumarate (pco). C, Proportion
  of labeled precursors incorporated into total lignin in stem and root tissues of
  30 days-old in vitro grown plants. D, Proportion of labeled precursors incorporated
  into each individual monolignol (H-, G-, and S-units) in root tissues of 30-days-old
  in vitro grown plants. E, Simplified lignin pathways depicting the ratio between
  incorporation of 13C9-Phe and 13C9-Tyr for each pathway intermediate and lignin
  subunit in roots of Brachypodium RNAi lines. Dashed bars are control plants, error
  bars indicate ±sd (n = 3). Asterisks indicate significant differences: P < 0.0001,
  one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s test in (C), and P <0.05, two-sided unpaired
  t test in (D). In (E), blue and green colors indicate metabolites that preferentially
  incorporate 13C9-Phe or 13C9-Tyr, respectively (P < 0.05, two-sided unpaired t test).'
