caption: DUSP4 depletion enhanced Lenvatinib resistance by activating the MAPK/ERK
  pathway. (A) The KEGG pathway analysis showed that DUSP4 participated in Pathways
  in cancer, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton
  and other pathways related cancer progression. (B-C) The GSEA enrichments demonstrated
  that DUSP4 is enriched in drug metabolism, Peroxisome, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton
  and Cell adhesion molecules. (D) The GeneMANIA network showed that DUSP4 is closely
  associated with MAPK family. (E) protein-protein interaction network revealed that
  DUSP4 is closely related to DUSP family and MAPK family.
