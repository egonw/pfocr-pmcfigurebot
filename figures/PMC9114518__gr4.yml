caption: 'JAM-A dimerization serves as a cell-cell contact sensing mechanism to initiate
  Hippo signaling(A) Overexpression of a dimerization-deficient JAM-A mutant (JAM-A-DL1)
  results in enhanced proliferation. Representative immunofluorescent images of EdU
  incorporation (green) and nuclei (blue) in SW480 IEC overexpressing JAM-A full-length
  (JAM-A- WT) or JAM-A-DL1. Graph represents average percentage of EdU positive cells
  from 10 fields of view for each experiment (JAM-A-WT or JAM-A-DL1) and three independent
  experiments performed, which are denoted by dots on the graph. Overexpression of
  JAM-A-WT resulted in a significant decrease in proliferating cells, whereas the
  JAM-A-DL1 mutant was unable to suppress proliferation. Scale bar, 20 μm.(B) Evaluation
  of Hippo signaling activity in JAM-A-DL1 overexpressing IEC. Representative western
  blots of p-LATS1 S909, LATS1, p-YAP S127, YAP, and JAM-A on cell lysate from SW480
  IEC overexpressing JAM-A-WT and JAM-A-DL-1. Beta-actin serves as a loading control.
  Graph represents digital densitometry of p-LATS1 S909 and p-YAP S127. JAM-A-WT overexpressing
  IEC exhibit increased LATS1 activity and decreased YAP activity characteristic of
  Hippo pathway activation. Relative to the JAM-A-WT overexpressing cells, JAM-A-DL1
  cells exhibit decreased activation of Hippo signaling. All data are means ± SEM
  of three independent experiments. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001: two-tailed
  Student’s t test. See also .'
