caption: 'Effect of suramin on chondrogenic and hypertrophic marker gene expression
  in chondrocytes. The P3 passage of chondrocytes were treated: a) with or without
  10 μM suramin for various timepoints; or b) with differents amount of suramin (0
  to 10 μM) for one day, and the protein expressions of collagen, type II, alpha 1
  (COL2A1), COL10A1, and aggrecan (ACAN) were analyzed by western blot, with β-actin
  as the loading control. c) The chondrocytes were incubated with or without 10 μM
  suramin for 0.5 hours to 24 hours, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of Col2a1
  and Acan were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
  (qRT-PCR). d) Early (P1) or later passage (P6) of chondrocytes were treated with
  or without suramin, and the protein expressions of COL2A1, COL10A1, and ACAN were
  analyzed by western blot. e) Relative mRNA levels in chondrocytes treated with or
  without suramin were tested for cartilage-specific markers such as Col2a1, Col10a1,
  and Acan, as well as Col1 (dedifferentiation marker) using qRT-PCR (n = 3). Values
  were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Data are shown
  as mean (standard deviation (SD)); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. f) Representative
  immunofluorescence images of COL2A1 (green) and COL10a1 (red). Nuclei were stained
  with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue). g) Chondrocyte pellets were treated
  with or without suramin for 28 days and dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay determining
  total sulphated glycosaminoglycan content normalized to DNA content; **p < 0.01
  between groups. Data shown are representative of three independent replicates. h)
  Alcian blue staining was used to examine the effects of suramin on GAG expression
  in pellet culture of chondrocytes. Scale bar = 50 μm. i) Immunofluorescence and
  immunohistochemistry for COL2A1 and COL1A1 on chondrocyte pellets in the presence
  or absence of 10 μM suramin for 28 days.'
