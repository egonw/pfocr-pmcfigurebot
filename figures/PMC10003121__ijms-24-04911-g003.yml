caption: Recovery by GW9662 for cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase
  triggered by SV in prostate cells. (A) Apoptotic cells staining with Annexin V and
  PI were revealed by flow cytometry analysis in BPH-1 and WPMY-1 cells treated by
  GW9662 at 0 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, and 60 μM for 24 h, and continually treated by simvastatin
  at 0 μM and 5 μM for 48 h (i). Apoptotic rates (%) were statistically analyzed (ii).
  (B) Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle in BPH-1 and WPMY-1 cells after simvastatin
  and GW9662 treatment (i). Cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by GW9662 was statistically
  analyzed (ii). (C) Western blot assay (i) and relative densitometric quantification
  (ii) of apoptosis-related and cell-cycle-related proteins in BPH-1 and WPMY-1 cells
  after simvastatin and GW9662 treatment. Cell types, concentration of simvastatin
  and GW9662 treatments, and protein masses are indicated. SV simvastatin, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA.
