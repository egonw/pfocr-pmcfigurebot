figure_title: Analysis of enriched of tryptophan metabolism pathway that B. bassiana
  JEF-410 were infected red mite were infected at early stage
caption: (A) Summarized acetyl-CoA synthesis pathway and secondary metabolite synthesis
  pathway of BNA2 dioxygenase, BNA4 kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, BNA7 arylformamidase,
  PEP5 tethering complex subunit, KGD2 alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, LPB3 acetyl-CoA
  C-acetyltransferase; PK, polyketide. (B) Histone acetylation is responsible for
  synthesis of acetyl-CoA and amplification of DNA expression level. (C) The Hog1
  pathway for overcoming oxidative stress in mitochondria starts from acetyl-CoA;
  MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase; Hog1 branched MAPK signal transduction system.
