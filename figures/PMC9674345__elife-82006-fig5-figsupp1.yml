figure_title: Gene enrichment and pathway analysis of CD44s- and CD44v6-overexpressing
  (OE) colon cancer cells
caption: (A) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes (absLFC >2, pval
  <0.01, red) by comparing parental cell lines to the CD44s- and CD44v6-OE samples
  in both cell lines. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis of parental, CD44s- and CD44v6-OE
  cells compared with each other in HCT116 and SW480 cells shown in heatmap, respectively.
  Only significantly altered pathways (normalized enrichment score [NES] >1, and pval
  <0.05) are shown.
