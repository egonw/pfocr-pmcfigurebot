figure_title: 'Schematic illustration of mitochondrial swelling and rupture following
  mPTP opening, leading to the release of multiple pro-death factors: Cyt c, AIF,
  PNPT1, and mtDNA'
caption: Upon mPTP opening, Cyt c is released into the cytoplasm, play a crucial role
  in triggering cell death pathways in a caspase-dependent manner through the formation
  of apoptosome. AIF translocates from the IMS to the cytoplasm and nucleus, inducing
  caspase-independent peripheral chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation,
  contributing to cell death programs. In addition, the rupture of the outer membrane
  facilitates PNPT1 and mtDNA release into the cytoplasm. PNPT1, a 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease,
  is released from the IMS, initiating the apoptotic decay of RNAs lacking 3’ structures
  and enhancing apoptosis by reducing the expression of unstable anti-apoptotic proteins.
  Meanwhile, the release of mtDNA induces inflammation and type I interferon responses
  via the cytoplasmic cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway, thereby enhancing anti-tumor
  immune responses.
