caption: HMGB1-related gene enrichment analysis suggests four correlated genes. (a)
  A Venn diagram of the HMGB1-related selected genes. (b) Protein analysis on STRING
  tool. (c) A heatmap representing analysis of relationships between HMGB1 and four
  hub genes in multicancer types. (d) HMGB1-related KEGG pathway analysis. (e) The
  HMGB1-related centplot. (f) The corresponding scatter plots. (g) The expression
  of HMGB1-related hub genes (CDK1, HMGB2, SSRP1, H2AFV) in GEPIA database. (h) The
  changes in the expression of the 4 molecules were detected by immunohistochemical
  experiment in normal tissue and colorectal cancer (COAD) model. * Statistically
  significant p-value calculated (Pearson correlation analysis) p < 0.05.
