caption: 'DDT ameliorated CoCl2-induced PC12 cells apoptosis via ASK1/MKK7/JNK signaling
  pathway. (A) The expression of JNK signaling-related proteins p-ASK1 (Sup F. 29),
  ASK1 (Sup F. 30), p-MKK7 (Sup F. 31), MKK7 (Sup F. 32), p-JNK (Sup F. 33), JNK (Sup
  F. 34), p-c-JUN (Sup F. 35), c-JUN (Sup F. 36) by Western blot analysis. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of the protein production levels of (A). (C) PC12 cells were pretreated
  with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (20 μM) for 1 h, followed by exposure to CoCl2,
  and/or DDT for 12 h. p-JNK (Sup F. 37), JNK (Sup F. 38), Bax (Sup F. 39) and cleaved-Caspase
  3 (Sup F. 40) were evaluated by Western blot analysis with GADPH (Sup F. 41) as
  the internal control. (D) Densitometric results for Western blot are resented in
  the right panels. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. Ctrl group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001 vs. CoCl2 model group. △△△p < 0.001 vs. DDT group.'
