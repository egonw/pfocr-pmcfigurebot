figure_title: Inhibition of the re-activated MAPK pathway restores sensitivity to
  immunotherapy in RTT tumours
caption: 'a, Scheme illustrating the rationale and experiment to inhibit MAPK signalling
  in RTT cells and profile the contribution of MAPK signalling to cross-resistance.
  b, Gene expression changes in ccIES-genes in response to 72h of MEKi in RTT Braf/PtenOVA
  melanoma cells sorted from Rag2-/-mice (RTT, n = 5; RTT+ MEKi n = 6 tumours). c,
  Gene expression changes analysed via SMART-Seq in ccIES genes (divided into up and
  downregulated genes) in NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma cells sorted from tumours
  after 72h of MEKi treatment (n = 3 tumours per condition, in technical triplicates).
  Black line highlights Mean. d, Suppressive myeloid cells and CD103+ DC levels in
  NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA tumours 3 days post MEK inhibition (NTT, RTTn = 9 tumours;
  RTT+ MEKi, n = 10 tumours). Experiment performed twice; data represents pool of
  both experiments. P-value: CD11b+GR-1+ **** 2.5E-6, 5.2E-8; CD103+CD11c+ **** 2.3E-9,
  * 0.048. e, Tumour infiltration of OT-1Luc T cells in RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma,
  measured by BLI at indicated days post ACT, MEKi started 24h before ACT (RTT, n
  = 4; RTT+ MEKi, n = 5 tumours). Experiment performed 3 times; representative example
  shown. P-value: ** 0.0087, * 0.0159. f, Co-culture of CD103+ DCs isolated from NTT,
  RTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma treated with MEKi (0.5mg/kg for 3 doses) with
  CFSE labelled naïve OT-1 T cells displayed as representative histogram of CFSE signal
  in T cells. g, Spider plot indicating tumour volume in RTT Braf/PtenOVA tumour bearing
  mice treated with indicated therapies (all groups n = 4; except MEKi + ACT, n =
  5 mice). Experiment performed twice; representative example shown. h, Summary scheme
  highlighting the core findings. Data in d, e displayed as mean ± SEM. Data analysis
  d one-way ANOVA e two-tailed unpaired t-test with Welch correction for unequal variance
  or Mann-Whitney U test if not normal distributed. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ****
  P < 0.0001, ns = non-significant.'
