caption: Myeloid cell-specific DAX1 deletion shows a similar effect to ConA-induced
  liver injury in mice. (a) Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from WT and Dax1 MKO mice
  were isolated, and mRNA extracts from cells were conducted using quantitative real-time
  PCR (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression levels of Dax1 (RT-qPCR was performed in
  seven technical replicates). (b,c) C57BL/6J (WT) and myeloid cell-specific Dax1
  knockout (MKO) mice were treated with single administration of concanavalin A (ConA)
  (15 mg/kg, i.v.) for 9 h (WT; n = 7, MKO; n = 6). (b) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
  staining was performed in the liver tissues, and representative images are shown.
  (c) Plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
  (AST). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t-test was used
  to compare the MKO and WT groups; *** p < 0.001 and ns = not significant.
