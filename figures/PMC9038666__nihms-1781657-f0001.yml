caption: Quantitative PCR for insulin receptor 1 and 2 in Taenia solium cysts. Quantitative
  PCR of cDNA from 500 ng of total RNA from the racemose form compared with the bladder
  wall and scolex of the vesicular form. Results are normalised to the housekeeping
  gapdh gene and expressed as the fold increase in expression. Statistically significant
  differences in leves of gene expression are indicated by asterisks (Mann-Whitney
  U test). **P<0.01.
article_title: Proliferative cells in racemose neurocysticercosis have an active MAPK
  signalling pathway and respond to metformin treatment.
