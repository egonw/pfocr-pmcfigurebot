caption: 'The establishment of cardiac hypertrophy model. A) Cultured primary cardiomyocytes
  were treated with Ang II or control, then the cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry
  with actin antibody. The images captured by LSM 780 confocal microscope and were
  analyzed and the relative cell surface area was measured to indicate hypertrophy
  response (B). The cells were subjected to RT-qPCR to detect the mRNA level (C) and
  the protein levels of ANP, BNP and β-MHC. *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; repeated
  three times; scale bar: 20 μm.'
