caption: 'Mineralized bone formation after ectopic implantation of 3D bio-printed
  hydrogel scaffolds with different densities of BMSCs. (a) X-ray images of rats''
  posterior gluteus muscle pouches implanted with biological scaffolds at week 2,
  4 and 8. Scale bar: 5 ​mm. (b) A schematic illustration of isolation of mineralized
  biological scaffolds from rat posterior gluteal muscle pouches. (c) EDS energy spectrum
  analysis of mineralized scaffolds. Scanning electron micrographs of mineralized
  nodules, distribution of P and Ca elements, and spectrums of various elemental compositions
  are shown. (d) Micro-CT imaging of biological scaffolds with different densities
  of BMSCs implanted in rat muscle pouches after 2, 4, and 8 weeks (silver color represents
  mineralized bone, yellow represents fibrous soft tissue) and (e) the corresponding
  bone volume fraction. Scale bar: 4 ​mm αp<0.05 vs T0; βp<0.05 vs T5; γp<0.05 vs
  T6; δp<0.05 vs T7. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
