caption: '(A,B) Frequency of functional (deleterious) ARID1A (fARID1A) by cancer type
  and examination of co-occurring alterations by pathway. (A) Percentage of patients
  with functional ARID1A (fARID1A) cfDNA alterations by cancer type. Of 62,851 patients
  with ≥1 cfDNA alteration detected, 3137 (5%) had ≥1 deleterious (functional) ARID1A
  alteration (fARID1A alteration). Nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site
  alterations were considered functional variants. (B) The frequency of alterations
  in certain pathways was examined on a per-patient basis (i.e., counting each patient
  once even if they had multiple alterations in the same pathway). The denominator
  equates to the total number of patients with (n = 1088) or without (n = 23,935)
  a functional ARID1A alteration and at least one cfDNA alteration detected. In this
  pan-cancer cohort, numerous pathways were more frequently altered (statistically
  significant differences, p ≤ 0.05, marked with *, Fisher’s exact test) in patients
  with functional ARID1A genomic alterations. The genes included in each pathway are
  provided in . The numbers beside the bars represent percentages. For instance, the
  “13” beside “WNT/Beta-catenin” means that 13% of ARID1A-altered samples had ≥1 WNT/Beta-catenin
  pathway alteration. (Note: MSI-H samples were excluded from this analysis.) Abbreviations:
  MSI-H = microsatellite instability-high.'
