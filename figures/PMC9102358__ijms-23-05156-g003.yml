caption: 'RNase 7 affected UPEC infection and STAT3 expression in bladder cells. After
  24 h of pretreatment with different concentrations of RNase 7 (1, 5, and 25 μg/mL)
  and 15 mM glucose, GFP-UPEC and PE-STAT3 expression in SV-HUC-1 cells post-infection
  were (A) observed by fluorescence microscopy and (B) measured using ImageJ software.
  Cells infected with UPEC alone were used as the positive controls. The data shown
  are representative of a typical result. DAPI was used to count the number of cells
  and as a standard for calculating the fluorescence expression ratio of cells. Cell
  images were captured using a microscope (Leica) at 100× magnification. The definitions
  of each letter/number represented by the X axis are: U: UPEC infection alone; G:
  with 15 mM glucose pretreatment alone; 1, 5, and 25: pretreated with 1, 5, and 25
  μg/mL RNase 7, respectively, + 15 mM glucose. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared
  to UPEC infection control groups. ## p < 0.01, #### p < 0.0001, compared between
  the two groups.'
