caption: Effect of the STING agonist 2’3’-cGAMP, the STING antagonist H151 and recombinant
  IFN-β on in vitro Leishmania infection. Differentiated WT [(A), (B) and (C)], cGAS-
  [(D)] or STING- (E) knockout THP-1 cells were infected with eGFP expressing L. major
  parasites at a MOI of 1:10 (macrophage:parasite). Infection percentages and parasite
  loads were quantified using a flow cytometer 24 h later. H151 [2 or 4 µg/ml; (A)
  and (B)], cGAMP [10, 20 or 40 µg/ml; (B), (C), (D) and (E)] or recIFN-β [50 ng/ml;
  (C), (D) and (E)] were added 8, 2 and 8 hours prior to infection, respectively.
  Data represent average ± SD. All groups were compared statistically by one-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnet`s multiple comparison test. ns, not significant, *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01,
  ***p≤0.001, ****p≤0.0001.
