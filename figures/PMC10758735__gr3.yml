caption: (A) Proliferation analysis revealed that the cells in normal group grew faster
  and reached the stationary phase in day 5, while those in the AED group reached
  the same level in day 7, indicating a difference proliferation ability between the
  two groups. (B) Colony formation in the two groups; both could form colonies and
  did not differ in terms of the amounts of colonies. Data are means ± SEM. * means
  p < 0.05, ** means p < 0.01, *** means p < 0.001.
