figure_title: FD268 regulates the expressions of cell cycle related protein in HL-60
  and MOLM-16 cells
caption: Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of FD268 for 24 h. Transcriptional
  levels of cell cycle related genes p21Cip1, p27Kip1 and CDK2 were determined using
  qRT-PCR in HL-60 (A) and MOLM-16 (B) cells. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test. Statistical significance is represented with asterisks *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. (C) The levels of apoptosis-related protein CDK2 in
  control and FD268-treated cells were determined by western blot. Intensity of the
  bands was measured, and the fold change of the intensity was compared with that
  of the control and indicated below the bands. β-actin was used as a loading control.
