caption: The DPC-Exos identification. (a) Detection of the shape and size of the DPC-Exos
  by TEM (scale bars, 100 nm). (b) Detection of the particle size and concentration
  of the DPC-Exos by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). (c) Detection of the expression
  of exosome-specific surface markers of the DPC-Exos by Western blotting. (d) DiI-DPC-Exos
  could enter HFSCs (passage 2) in the Transwell plate (scale bars, 50 μm).
