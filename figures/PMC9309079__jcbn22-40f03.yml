caption: Hypothetical scheme of copper (Cu)/zinc (Zn)-induced neurotoxicity. Under
  pathological conditions such as transient global ischemia, excess Cu‍2+ and Zn‍2+
  are secreted into the synaptic cleft and co-exist in the same synapse. Zn‍2+ can
  be translocated through calcium (Ca)-permeable amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid (AMPA)/kainate-type glutamate receptors (Ca-A/K-R), N-methyl-d-aspartate-type
  glutamate receptors (NMDA-R), and voltage gated Ca‍2+ channels (VGCC). In general,
  ZnT-1 acts to maintain the intracellular Zn concentration ([Zn‍2+]i) by facilitating
  Zn‍2+ efflux and inhibiting voltage-gated Ca‍2+ channels and NMDA-R. However, excess
  Zn‍2+ can cause the elevation of both [Zn‍2+]i and [Ca‍2+]i and trigger endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress pathways, which inhibits NAD‍+, causes energy depletion in
  mitochondria, and induces neurodegeneration. Aluminum (Al‍3+) inhibits voltage-gated
  Ca‍2+ channels and attenuates Zn neurotoxicity. The addition of Cu‍2+ produces ROS,
  which upregulate the ER stress and stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun amino-terminal
  kinases (SAPK/JNK) pathways, exacerbate neuronal death, and eventually induce the
  pathogenesis of vascular dementia. SP600125, an inhibitor of the SAPK/JNK signaling
  pathway, attenuates Cu/Zn neurotoxicity. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) and a conjugated
  protein consisting of thioredoxin and human serum albumin (HSA-Trx) suppress ROS
  production and attenuate Cu/Zn neurotoxicity. Colored circles represent Zn, Cu,
  Ca, and Al.
