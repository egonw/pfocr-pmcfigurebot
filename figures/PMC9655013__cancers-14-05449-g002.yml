caption: Isogenic melanoma models are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but not to BRAF
  non-specific chemotherapeutics in 2D tissue culture. (A) Dabrafenib resistance of
  A375 melanoma models in 2D tissue culture; (B) Vemurafenib resistance of A375 melanoma
  models in 2D tissue culture; (C) No resistance to the BRAF non-specific chemotherapeutic
  doxorubicin in 2D tissue culture; (D) Immunoblot demonstrating BRAF inhibitor resistance
  in EGFR pathway signaling in NRAS Q61K and KRAS G13D A375 melanoma models. Cells
  were treated with 1.0 Î¼M of the indicated drug for 90 min prior to harvesting protein;
  (E) Dose-response curve for the MEK inhibitor trametinib in the MEK1 Q56P melanoma
  model in 2D tissue culture; (F) The same curve as in (E) for the MEK inhibitor binimetinib.
