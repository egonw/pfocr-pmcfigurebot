caption: Effect of Salmonella on constitutively-AKT and autophagic pathway. The ASH-3
  (A) and KMH-2 (B) cells (106 cells/well) were placed into 6-well plates and incubated
  at 37 °C for 24 hours. The cells were transfected with control or constitutively
  active AKT plasmids (5ug) at 37 °C for 6 hours and then infected with 0 or 100 MOI
  Salmonella for 90 min. The expression level of AKT/mTOR/p70S6K proteins and autophagic
  marker in cells were analyzed by Western blotting. β-actin was used as an internal
  loading control. Quantification histograms are presented beneath each Western blotting
  plot. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of hexaplicate determinations. Each experiment
  was repeated three times with similar results.
