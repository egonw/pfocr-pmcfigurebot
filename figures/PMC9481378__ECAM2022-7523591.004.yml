caption: 'miR-29b-1-5p mediates inflammatory response and lung injury in LPS-induced
  ALI in vivo through the Akt/ERK signaling pathway via the RTN4. (a) qRT-PCR and
  Western blot analyses of miR-29b-1-5p and RTN4 expressions in mouse lung tissues
  of LPS-conditioned mice. (b) W/D ratio of LPS-induced mouse lungs. (c) MPO activity
  of LPS-induced mouse lungs. (d) The levels of IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the
  BALF of normal mice and LPS-induced ALI mice. (e) The ratio of p-Akt/total Akt and
  p-ERK1/2/total ERK1/2 in lung tissues of LPS-conditioned mice. ∗, p < 0.05vs. LPS-induced
  ALI mice and #p < 0.05vs. miR-29b-1-5p agomir.'
