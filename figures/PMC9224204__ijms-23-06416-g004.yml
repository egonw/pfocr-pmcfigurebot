caption: Putative signaling pathway underlying the antidepressant actions of LY341495
  in the hippocampus. LY341495 increases extracellular glutamate release, thereby
  inducing BDNF release. BDNF stimulates the TrkB receptor and downstream signaling
  pathways PI3K/Akt and MAPK, in turn activating mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 activates
  p70S6K and inhibits 4E-BP-1, thereby increasing the translation of transcripts encoding
  the synaptic proteins PSD-95 and GluA1 (which enhance AMPA receptor transmission).
  The synaptic plasticity is thus enhanced, and, overall, this process is associated
  with the antidepressant effects of LY341495. The molecular pathway marked in red
  are the pathway observed in the current study. Akt, protein kinase B; AMPA, Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
  acid; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Ca2+, calcium; eIF4E, eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E; eIF4B, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  4B; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GluA1, AMPA receptor subunit GluA1;
  MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; mGlu2/3, metabotropic glutamate 2/3; mTORC1, mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1; p70S6K, p70S6 kinase; PI3K, phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase;
  PSD-95, postsynaptic density-95; S6, small ribosomal protein 6; TrKB, tropomyosin-related
  kinase B; 4E-BP-1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein
