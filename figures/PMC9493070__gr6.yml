caption: Results of the enrichment analyses in the TCGA cohort. (A) The significant
  GO term analyses of differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk
  groups. (Red indicated up-regulation; Blue indicated down-regulation; Yellow indicated
  biological process class; blue indicated molecular function class; green indicated
  cellular component class.) (B) The significant KEGG term analyses of differentially
  expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups. (Red indicated up-regulation;
  Blue indicated down-regulation; Yellow indicated Signaling Pathway class; Blue label
  belonged to cellular process class. Purple label belonged to else class). (C) The
  Ridge plot by GSEA between the high- and low-risk groups showed the top 15 significant
  GO terms. (D) The Enrichment plot by GSEA between the high- and low-risk groups
  showed the top 15 significant KEGG terms (Permutation tests P < 0.05, FDR < 0.25).
