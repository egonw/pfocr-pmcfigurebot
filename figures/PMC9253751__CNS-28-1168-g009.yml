caption: Toll‐like receptor cell signaling pathways. Every TLR family member, except
  TLR3, uses the MyD88‐dependent signaling pathway. TRAP bridges MyD88 to TLR1/6/2/4
  and felicitates their interactions with TRAF6. TRAF6 activates the complex of TAK1
  which activates both the IKK complex and MAPK. IKKs induce translocation of NF‐κB
  to the nucleus where pro‐inflammatory gene expression is triggered. MAPKs cause
  the AP‐1 nuclear translocation. TLR 7/8 and 9 activate MyD88 initiates the translocation
  of IRF7 to the nucleus and leads to IFN expression. TLR3 and TLR4 recruit TRIF and
  lead to translocation of IRF3/IRF7 and NF‐κB to the nucleus resulting in the expression
  of various IFNs and cytokines. Furthermore, TRIF can interact with TRAF6 through
  an effect on RIP‐1, which is followed by NF‐κB activation and production of the
  proinflammatory complex. TLR, Toll‐like receptor; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; TRAP, transmembrane adaptor protein; TAK1, transforming
  growth factor beta‐activated kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinases;
  IKKs, inhibitory kappa B kinases; NF‐κB, nuclear factor‐kappa B; AP‐1, activator
  protein 1; IRF7, interferon regulatory factor 3; IFNs, interferons; RIP‐1, receptor‐interacting
  serine/threonine–protein kinase 1
