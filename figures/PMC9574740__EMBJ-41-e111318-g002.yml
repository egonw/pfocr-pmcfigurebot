figure_title: Trans‐sulfuration and Uba4‐Urm1 are independent pathways for protein
  thiolation
caption: 'ATBH cytotoxicity assay in vivo. Basic growth and the synthetic effect in
  wild‐type ahp1Δ, urm1Δ, tum1Δ, ncs6Δ, cys3Δ, cys4Δ, cys3Δ urm1Δ, and cys4Δ urm1Δ
  strains was monitored without or with 1 mM TBH.BH2S production using Biggy agar
  plates—Wild‐type, ahp1Δ, urm1Δ, tum1Δ, ncs6Δ, cys3Δ, cys4Δ, cys3Δ urm1Δ, and cys4Δ
  urm1Δ strains were grown on Biggy medium, and H2S production was recorded as indicated
  in the material and methods section.C In vivo Ahp1 conjugation analyses with protein
  extracts obtained from the indicated yeast strains expressing HA‐URM1. Unconjugated
  Urm1 and Urm1‐Ahp1 conjugates were detected by anti‐HA (top panels) Western blots.
  Anti‐Ahp1 blots (middle) detect unmodified Ahp1. Anti‐Cdc19 (bottom panels) served
  as a loading control.DNorthern blot analysis for thiolation levels of  in the genetic
  background of the indicated yeast strains. Total tRNA was resolved on denaturing
  PAGE supplemented with APM to retard the migration of thiolated . APM: ([N‐Acryloyl‐amino]
  phenyl) mercuric chloride. (bottom) Quantified thiolation levels from three independent
  biological replicates.EScheme of sulfur source for thiolation. Sulfur released as
  H2S from trans‐sulfuration enzymes Cys4 and Cys3 is used for protein persulfidation,
  scavenging free radicals metabolic signaling/stimulation. The sulfur from the Uba4‐Urm1
  pathway is directed to tRNA thiolation and to the persulfidation of specific cysteine
  of target proteins.'
article_title: E2/E3‐independent ubiquitin‐like protein conjugation by Urm1 is directly
  coupled to cysteine persulfidation.
