caption: 3-IPA and purines were prioritized as candidates to modulate immune responses
  to LCMV infection. (A) Metabolite candidates prioritized and chosen using a weighted
  algorithm employing statistical significance (40%), fold change (40%) and cognitive
  computing analysis (20%). The scoring (0 to 1) is represented on the color coded
  graph segmented into the weighed contributions of each factor. Red/dark blue represent
  statistics for the two mouse models, pink/light blue represent a fold change for
  the two mouse models, and black represents cognitive computing contributions. Full
  data can be found in the . (B) Dysregulated metabolites were projected (red dots)
  onto the purine and tryptophan metabolism pathways. (C) Purine metabolism intermediates
  fold change over the course of the LCMV infection for both models. (D) 3-IPA synthesis
  pathway metabolites fold change over the course of the LCMV infection for both models.
  Data were normalized using the strain that survived with a persistent infection
  (DBA2 and B mice) prior to the LCMV inoculation. Statistical comparisons were calculated
  in respect to the same animals at day 0 (* q < 0.05, ** q < 0.01, and *** q < 0.001,
  determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test) or
  between both animal colonies at day 5 († q < 0.05, †† q < 0.01, and ††† q < 0.001,
  determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test).
