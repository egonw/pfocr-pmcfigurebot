caption: 'Effect of ANKRD49 expression on the invasion and metastasis and P38 MAPK/ATF‐2/MMPs
  signalling in nude mice in vivo. (A) Visible metastatic nodules and hemorrhagic
  spots on the lungs of the mice injected with ANKRD49 OE A549 cells but not their
  vector‐A549 cells. (B) Body weights and the number of metastatic nodules and hemorrhagic
  spots of the mice were determined following the injections of ANKRD49 OE A549 cells
  or their control vector cells (n = 5). (C) Immunoreactivities of ANKRD49, NKX2‐1,
  Napsin A, Fibronectin, MMP‐2, MMP‐9, p‐P38, and p‐ATF‐2 in lung tissues of the mice
  injected with ANKRD49 OE A549 cells or control vector‐A549 cells. Scale bar 50 μm.
  (D) HE staining of nude mouse lung tissue. Scale bar: 50 μm. (E) H‐score analysis
  of ANKRD49, NKX2‐1, Napsin A, Fibronectin, MMP‐2, MMP‐9, p‐P38, and p‐ATF‐2 immunoreactivities
  in lung tissues of the mice injected with ANKRD49 OE A549 cells or control vector‐A549
  cells. (F) IHC score relevance of ANKRD49 and MMP‐2, MMP‐9, p‐P38, and p‐ATF‐2.
  Data are shown as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001; ns,
  no significance'
