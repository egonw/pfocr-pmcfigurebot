caption: 'Organization of glycosylation genes in the Mimivirus genus. Genes in bold
  indicate that their activity has been experimentally validated, otherwise they are
  written in plain text. The activity of each gene is color coded as reported in the
  legend or is explicitly mentioned (in brackets) in the schemes of the reactions.
  The arrows below the gene names indicate the direction of the coding strand. Importantly,
  sugar fibril composition has only been determined experimentally for the viruses
  in the A, B, and C clades; for the other clades (D and E), sugar composition is
  predicted from in silico analysis. (a) Clade A: APMV glycogene cluster (12 genes)
  corresponds to UDP-β-l-Rha and UDP-α-d-Vio4NAc production, along with methyl-, pyruvyl-,
  and glycosyltransferases and other enzymes either manipulating sugars or involved
  in the construction of the fibrils. (b) Clade B: Moumouvirus australiensis glycogene
  cluster (12 genes) corresponds to the biosynthetic pathway for l-QuiNAc and d-QuiNAc4NAc,
  and several GTs and other sugar manipulating enzymes including those of sulfate
  metabolism. (c) Clade B: Moumouvirus maliensis cluster (six genes) corresponds to
  d-QuiNAc and d-FucNAc production: notably, Mm419 and Mm421 are two 4-reductases,
  and it is not clear which one produces d-QuiNAc or d-FucNAc. (d) Clade C: Megavirus
  chilensis cluster (six glycogenes) corresponds to l-QuiNAc and l-RhaNAc production;
  notably the activity of Mg534 and Mg535 has been determined experimentally, while
  that of Mg536 was only predicted. (e) Clade D: Tupanvirus deep ocean cluster (33
  genes in total, only the 25 related to carbohydrate metabolism are displayed) is
  predicted to correspond to the biosynthesis of d-QuiNAc4NAc and to that of a yet
  unidentified 6-deoxy-d-HexNAc (either d-QuiNAc or d-FucNAc) along with several other
  glycogenes. (f) Clade E: Cotonvirus japonicus cluster (21 genes) is predicted to
  correspond to l-QuiNAc and d-QuiNAc4NAc production, along with enzymes involved
  in sulfate metabolism and others.'
