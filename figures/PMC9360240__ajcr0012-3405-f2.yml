caption: Up-regulation of SHMT2 promotes cell growth in breast cancer. SHMT2 protein
  was detected by western blot in HCC1806 with SHMT2 knockdown (A) and ZR-75-1 (E)
  with SHMT2 over-expression. And the cell lines HCC1806 (B) and ZR-75-1 (F) were
  photographed. The cell viability of breast cancer cell lines HCC1806 (C) and ZR-75-1
  (G) were determined by MTT assay 48 h after transfection. The effect of down-regulation
  (D) or up-regulation (H) of SHMT2 on tumor cell colony formation was analyzed by
  plate clone formation assay. The relative colony formation rates in HCC1806 (D)
  and ZR-75-1 (H) cells were calculated. *P < 0.05, Student’s t-test. The data are
  presented as the mean ± SD of three tests.
