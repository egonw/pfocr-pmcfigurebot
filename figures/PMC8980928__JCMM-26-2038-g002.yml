caption: ST‐EVs promote cartilage inflammation and degeneration via NF‐κB signalling
  pathway. Normal chondrocytes were incubated with different concentrations of ST‐EVs
  (5, 10 × 107/ml) for 24 h, and the expression of NF‐κB p65 and IκK in chondrocytes
  was detected by WB (A‐C). Normal chondrocytes were incubated with ST‐EVs for 24 h
  after pretreatment with or without BMS‐345541 (5 μM), WB was used to detect the
  expression of NF‐κB p65 and IκK in chondrocytes (D‐F), and PCR was used to detect
  the expression of IL‐1β, IL‐6, MMP13 and ADAMTS5 in chondrocytes (G‐J). N = 3, *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01
