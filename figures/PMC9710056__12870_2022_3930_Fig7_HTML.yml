caption: Heatmap of log2FC values of the DEGs enriched in linoleic acid metabolism
  (ko00591) and alpha-linoleic acid metabolism pathway (ko00592). The figure panel
  on the right shows the enriched DEGs (highlighted in red boxes/text) on the alpha-linolenic
  acid metabolism pathway (ko00592) The map was developed in the KEGG pathway database
  [] using the KEGG pathway mapper [] by searching Ko IDs of the DEGs on respective
  pathways. Where CK = 0.8% salt stressed, B1, B2, B3, and B4 = 0.8% salt-stressed
  seedlings exogenously sprayed with 100 ml of 50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, and 500 μM melatonin
  solution, respectively
article_title: Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed pathways involved
  in improved salt tolerance of Gossypium hirsutum L. seedlings in response to exogenous
  melatonin application.
