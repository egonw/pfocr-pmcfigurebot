caption: Schematic diagram of artonin F, which has a potential ability to induce apoptosis
  in human lung cancer cells and specifically triggers the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation
  of c-Met by inhibiting the activity of USP8 and at the catalytic residues of palmitoylating
  enzymes, this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor. The mechanism of action
  of artonin F is relatively specific through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
