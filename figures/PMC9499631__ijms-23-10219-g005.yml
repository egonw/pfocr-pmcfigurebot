caption: 'Outcomes of ICA in LPS-induced expression NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) The
  expression levels of the NF-κB-p65 and its phosphorylated (p-NF-κB-p65) form were
  detected by ELISA. (B) The expression levels of total IκBα and its phosphorylated
  (p-IκBα) form were detected by ELISA. (C) The protein expression levels of the TLR4,
  phosphorylated (p-NF-κB-p65), and phosphorylated (p-IκBα) were detected by western
  blotting. (D) The quantification of all the analyzed proteins. The β-Actin was used
  as a control. The data were statistically presented as means ± SEM. The # p < 0.001
  between CONT and LPS groups, and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 between
  LPS and ICA therapy groups. (CONT, LPS, and ICA stand for control, lipopolysaccharide,
  and Icariin groups [The ICA dose used was 50 mg/kg for uterine tissue]).'
