caption: Top three up-regulated and down-regulated pathways identified through ingenuity
  pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in ileum of pigs fed Zn-restricted
  diets (ZnR) compared with pigs fed diets supplemented with 50 and 100 mg of Zn/kg
  of diet from ZnCl2 (Zn50 (a) and Zn100 (b), respectively). z-score >2 or <−2 were
  considered significantly up-regulated (black bars) or down-regulated (grey bars),
  respectively. n 7 for ZnR, n 8 for Zn100 and Zn50.
article_title: Dietary zinc restriction affects the expression of genes related to
  immunity and stress response in the small intestine of pigs.
