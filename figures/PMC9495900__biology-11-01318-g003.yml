caption: 'Depicted is the end of ethanol metabolic pathway in T. neapolitana. The
  dotted line is a weak reaction; the green arrows are the forward reaction (ethanol
  formation); the blue arrows represent the detoxifying path. LDH: lactate dehydrogenase;
  POR: pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PDC: pyruvate decarboxylase; PTA: phosphate
  acetyltransferase; ACK: acetate kinase; Aldh: aldehyde dehydrogenase; Fe-AAdh: bifunctional
  iron-acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase; Fe-Adh1, Fe-Adh2, and Zn-Adh: Fe-/Zn- alcohol
  dehydrogenase.'
