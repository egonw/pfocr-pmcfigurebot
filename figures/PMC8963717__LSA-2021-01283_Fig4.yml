figure_title: Differential transcriptional rewiring between TET2 CD expression and
  decitabine treatment
caption: (A) Distribution of up- and down-regulated genes in DEGs from decitabine-treated
  MCF-7 cells (GSE74036) and from TET2 CD cells versus empty vector (EV) cells. (B)
  Overlap between DEG lists from decitabine-treated MCF-7 cells and from TET2 CD cells
  versus EV cells. A number of genes mentioned in text are highlighted. Note that
  the ESR1 gene encoding ERα is down-regulated both in decitabine-treated MCF-7 cells
  and in TET2 CD cells. (C) RT-qPCR validation of the similar and opposite effects
  of decitabine and TET2 CD expression on MCAM and DSCR8 RNA levels, respectively
  (mean ± SEM, n = 3). (D) Functional annotation of TET2 CD and decitabine up-regulated
  genes with GREAT. Only the top significantly enriched GO Biological processes are
  shown. (E) Outline of the antiviral response pathway. Double-stranded (ds) RNAs
  originating from viruses or from transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences
  (ERVs) can be sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which activate the
  mitochondria-associated protein MAVS. Active MAVS is protected from degradation
  by OTUD4 and stimulates the nuclear translocation of IRF3, IRF7, and NF-KB transcription
  factors to induce expression of type I interferon genes (IFNs) and, in turn, interferon-stimulated
  genes. Among interferon-stimulated genes, OAS1,2,3 and L activate RNAse L, which
  ultimately degrades dsRNAs. Activity of RNAse L can be counteracted by ABCE1 (figure
  made with BioRender, https://biorender.com). (F) Heatmap representation of the fold
  change of genes implicated in the type I interferon and antiviral response pathways.
  (G) RT-qPCR measurement of DDX58, OAS2, and IFIT1 in MCF-7 clones treated or not
  with 100 nM decitabine for 96 h (mean ± SEM, n = 3). (H) Correlation heatmap between
  TET2 and genes from the antiviral response pathway in BRCA tumors (normal-like tumors,
  n = 639). (I) RT-qPCR analysis of HERV-Fc1 and LTR12C endogenous retroviruses. Cells
  were treated with 100 nM decitabine for 96 h (mean ± SEM, n = 3). (J) Dot blot analysis
  of dsRNA in total RNA from EV, TET2 CD, and TET2 mCD cells. (K) RT-qPCR analysis
  of ABCE1, DDX58, OAS1, and IFIT1 in MCF-7 cells transfected either with a scrambled
  (scr) siRNA or with siRNA B and C targeting ABCE1 (mean ± SEM, n = 3). (L) Cell
  viability (MTT assay) after transfection of increasing concentrations of scrambled
  siRNA (scr) or ABCE1 siRNA C (mean ± SEM, n = 3).
