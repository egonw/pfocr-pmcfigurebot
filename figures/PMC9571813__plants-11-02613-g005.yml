caption: Metabolic processes modulated in maize plants treated with 0.05% LE (A) and
  1.00% LE (B) treatments. VIPs markers were loaded into the PlantCyc Pathway Tool
  (https://www.plantcyc.org/ Plant Metabolic Network; accessed on 20 November 2021).
  The x axis represents each set of metabolic subcategories, while the y axis corresponds
  to the accumulative log fold change (FC). The large dots represent the average (mean)
  of all FCs for the different metabolites in the class, while the small dots represent
  the individual log FC.
