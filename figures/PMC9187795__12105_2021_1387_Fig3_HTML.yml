caption: Schematic representation of CD30 signals. The presence of the ligand that
  activates CD30 in the cell membrane can lead to the activation of the MAPK pathway
  and its components, culminating in the activation of the NF-κB gene in the neoplastic
  cell nucleus (left). Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
  TRAF2 and TRAF5 in tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR1 signaling, leads to the
  recruitment and activation of a series of factors. This pathway leads to IKK activation
  through IKKβ phosphorylation, allowing the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus,
  favoring cell survival (central). Both lead to activation of the nuclear factor-kappa
  B, which triggers the transcription of anti-apoptotic factors, leading to cell proliferation
  and/or differentiation. Thus, activation of CD30 promotes neoplastic development
  in a series of human neoplasms. Due to its biological importance, the use of Brentuximab
  vedotin, an antibody–drug conjugate, releases into the cell anti-microtubule agent
  monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which induces cell cycle suspension and consequent
  apoptosis (right)
