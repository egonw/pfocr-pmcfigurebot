caption: 'Knockdown of SNHG16 attenuated the proliferation ability of human placenta-derived
  mesenchymal stem cells. A: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
  analysis of relative SNHG16 expression after transfection of SNHG16 short hairpin
  RNA (sh-SNHG16) and the corresponding controls (sh-NC) in human placenta-derived
  mesenchymal stem cells; B: Cell proliferation capacity evaluated by cell counting
  kit-8 assay; C: Cell cycle measured by flow cytometry; D: The G1 to S phase transition-related
  proteins and p-AKT detected by western blot analysis. Data are presented as means
  Â± standard deviation. bP < 0.01.'
article_title: Long non-coding RNA SNHG16 promotes human placenta-derived mesenchymal
  stem cell proliferation capacity through the PI3K/AKT pathway under hypoxia.
