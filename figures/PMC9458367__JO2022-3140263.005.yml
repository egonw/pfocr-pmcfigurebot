caption: The TGF-β signal score promoted individual immunotherapy for HNSC. (a) ROC
  curve of TGF-β signal score in Ascierto cohort 2016, Riaz cohort 2018, Homet cohort
  2019, Cho cohort 2020, Kim cohort 2019, and VanAllen cohort 2015, respectively.
  (b) Patients in the low-TGF-β signal score group (orange) displayed better overall
  survival than those in the high- TGF-β signal score group (gray) when using CTLA-4
  and PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, while patients in the low-TGF-β signal score group
  (orange) displayed worse overall survival than those in the high- TGF-β signal score
  group (gray) when using PD-1 monoclonal antibody.
