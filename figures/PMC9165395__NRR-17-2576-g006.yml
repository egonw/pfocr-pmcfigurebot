caption: 'Signaling pathways of the gene products involved in neurogenesis commonly
  identified in the cerebrospinal fluid proteomes of human, mouse and birds.(A) Dot
  plot of all significantly enriched Reactome pathways. Dots represent term enrichment
  with color coding scaled on the degree of statistical significance. The sizes of
  dots represent the number of proteins identified and the gene ratio refers to the
  proportion of the proteins implicated in the pathway out of the overall 196 analyzed
  proteins. (B) Network plot showing the relationship of all significantly enriched
  pathways in terms of their involved proteins. The size of the dot corresponding
  to each term represents their number of protein content. Proteins are labeled by
  their gene symbols. Regulation of IGF*: Regulation of Insulin-like Growth Factor
  transport and uptake by Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Proteins. The enriched
  pathways are statistically significant at P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05.'
