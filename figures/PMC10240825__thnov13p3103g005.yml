caption: Licoricidin promotes thermogenesis via the Adrb3-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway
  in adipocytes. (A) The expression of thermogenic genes was measured by qPCR (n =
  4 per group). Ctrl, control. (B) Differentiated primary subcutaneous adipocytes
  were treated with LCD for 24 h. The phosphorylation and protein level of CREB, phosphorylation
  of PKA substrate, and protein levels of UCP1, and PGC1α were analyzed by western
  blot. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate. CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein. P-CREB, the phosphorylation of CREB. PKA, protein kinase-A. P-PKA substrate,
  phosphorylation of PKA substrate. (C) Immunoblots (proteins indicated) were assessed
  in primary subcutaneous adipocytes incubated with or without PKA inhibitors H89
  (10 µM) for 2 h and followed by LCD treatment for 24 h. (D) cAMP levels accumulated
  in primary subcutaneous adipocytes that were treated or untreated with LCD (0.1
  µM) for 24 h (n = 7 per group). (E) Protein levels of PDE4D5, PDE4D4, PDE4D3, PDE4B,
  PDE3B were assessed by western blot following LCD (0.1 µM) treatment (n = 3 per
  group). PDE, phosphodiesterase. (F) Immunofluorescence images of primary adipocytes
  showed the position of LCD on the plasma membrane. Scale bar, 7 µM. (G) Immunoblots
  of indicated proteins in primary subcutaneous adipocytes treated or untreated with
  biotin-labelled LCD (0.1 µM) for 24 h (n = 3 per group). (H) Interaction between
  LCD and β3-AR was identified by immunoblot in 293T cells (n = 3 per group). IB,
  immunoblot. AP, affinity-pull down. TCL, total cell lysate. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
  (I) Representative images of autodocking for the transmembrane domain (TM) TM3,
  TM6, and TM7 of β3-AR and LCD. β3-AR, β3-adrenergic receptor. (J) Differentiated
  primary subcutaneous adipocytes were treated or untreated Adrb3 siRNA for 8h, followed
  by stimulated with LCD (0.1 µM) for 24 h. Ucp1 mRNA level was assayed by qPCR analysis
  (n = 3 per group). NCi, negative control-siRNA. Adrb3i, Adrb3-siRNA. (K) Immunoblot
  of UCP1 in differentiated primary subcutaneous adipocytes transfected (or not, -)
  with siRNA against Adrb3 (Adrb3i) (n = 3 per group). All data are representative
  of three independent experiments, each with a similar result. All data are means
  ± SEM. Statistical values *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 are analyzed by Student's t-test.
