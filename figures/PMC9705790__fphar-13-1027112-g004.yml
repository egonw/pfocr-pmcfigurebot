caption: GO/KEGG enrichment analysis of AO treat PIH (A), The bar graph of top 10
  GO items, including biological process (BP), cellular compound (CC) and molecular
  function (MF) (B), The bubble diagram of the top 10 KEGG pathway (C), GO chord chart
  (D), The core pathway, PI3K-AKT cascade mapped by KEGG Mapper database, whereby
  therapeutic targets were colored in red, targets of AO but not in the treatment
  of PIH were in blue, the other targets of PIH were yellow (E), The H-C-T network
  map showed the importance of each AO compounds, whereby 29 compounds ranked by degree
  value (F), The H-C-T-P-D network map showed the complex regulation of AO treat PIH.
  The deep green diamond represents herb (AO), the light green hexagon represents
  the therapeutic compound of AO, the red and orange circles represent targets based
  on the degree value, the blue V icon represents the pathway involved, and the yellow
  rectangle is the disease (PIH).
