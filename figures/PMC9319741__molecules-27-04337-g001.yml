caption: Z734 causes apoptosis and inhibits MCF–7 cells proliferation and migration.
  (A) The chemical structure of Z734. (B) Apoptosis levels were detected via flow
  cytometry. WT MCF–7 cells were treated with Z734 (0, 5, 10, and 15 μM) for 12 h.
  Flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cells was conducted using AnnexinV–FITC. (C)
  Measurement of Caspase3 activity after Z734 intervention in MCF–7 cells. (D) Apoptosis–related
  protein levels after treatment with Z734 were determined via Western blot analysis.
  (E) MCF–7 cells were treated with different doses of Z734 and incubated for 12 h.
  Cell proliferation was assessed via CCK–8 assays. (F) Ki67 distribution after treatment
  with Z734 was determined via immunofluorescence. Quantification of fluorescence
  was performed on the average optical density using the ImageJ software. Scale bars
  = 10 μm. (G) The percentage of colonies of MCF–7 cell lines was determined after
  treatment with Z734. (H) MCF–7 cells were treated with Z734 for 12 h and then analyzed
  for migration by transwell analysis. Scale bars = 20 μm. Data shown in (B,C,E,G,H)
  were used one–way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. Data shown in (F) was used two–tailed
  Student’s t–test. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, n.s., no significant
  difference.
