caption: Venn diagram revealing DAMs numbers from different combinations (A,B). KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of DAMs in different combinations of Benzoic acid vs.
  Chlorine dioxide (C), Benzoic acid vs. 1-MCP (D), Benzoic acid vs. Control (E),
  Chlorine dioxide vs. Control (F), 1-MCP vs. Chlorine dioxide (G), 1-MCP vs. Control
  (H). The x-axis and y-axis represent the enrichment factor and the enrichment pathway,
  respectively. Low and high p values are expressed by the red circle and the blue
  circle, respectively. The area of a circle is the DAM number. The enrichment was
  performed by Fisherâ€™s exact test.
