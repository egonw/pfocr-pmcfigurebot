figure_title: COPII up-regulation counterbalances the loss of epidermal growth factor
  receptor cell surface expression in low glucose condition
caption: (A) The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis of mRNA levels of COPI and COPII components
  in LUAD and LUSC, presented as Log2 fold changes in expression between tumor (T)
  and nontumor (NT) tissue. (B) Western blotting of SEC24D in LUAD and LUSC paired
  nontumor (N) and tumor (T) tissue samples (same membranes as the one used for ).
  Actin is used as a loading control. (C) mRNA level of COPII components grown for
  48 h under sufficient or limited glucose conditions and presented as log2 fold changes
  in expression between 0.1 and 10 mM of glucose. (D) Representative Western blotting
  of Sec24D in human bronchial epithelial cells cultured in sufficient (10 mM) or
  low (1 and 0.1 mM) glucose (Glc) conditions (same membrane as the one used for ).
  Actin is used as a loading control. (E) Representative FACS analysis of epidermal
  growth factor receptor surface expression in human bronchial epithelial cells grown
  for 48 h in medium containing 10 or 0.1 mM glucose and silenced or not for Sec24D.
  Inset shows Sec24D protein amounts upon silencing with siRNAs, and tubulin is used
  as a loading control.Source data are available for this figure.
