caption: 'Hypothetical schematic image of the relationship among the APRO proteins
  (APROs), exosomes, immune cells, immune check point PD-L1 on stromal fibroblasts,
  and the cancer cells’ invasion/metastasis. Indicated molecules are examples. Arrowhead
  means stimulation, whereas hammerhead represents inhibition. Note that some critical
  pathways such as inflammation activation and/or cancer cell growth pathway have
  been omitted for clarity. Abbreviations: APROs—APRO family proteins; miRNAs—microRNAs;
  MMPs—matrix metalloproteinases; PD-L1—programmed cell-death ligand 1.'
