caption: Overexpression of KLF4 suppresses NSCLC cell migration and invasion via inhibition
  of the JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway. (A) Western blotting assay of KLF4 expression
  in human NSCLC cell lines (H1975, H460, A549, H520 and NCI-1299) and normal pulmonary
  epithelium cell (16HBE). (B) Western blotting assay of KLF4 expression in A549 and
  H520 cells transfected with empty vector or KLF4-overexpression plasmids. (C) Cell
  proliferation, (D) colony formation, (E) migration (scale bar, 500 µm) and (F) invasion
  assays (scale bar, 200 µm) were performed with KLF4-transfected A549 and H520 cell
  lines. (G) Western blotting analysis of the expression of JAK2/STA3 signalling pathway
  markers in KLF4-transfected A549 and H520 cell lines. The results were obtained
  from four independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, ⁎⁎P<0.01,
