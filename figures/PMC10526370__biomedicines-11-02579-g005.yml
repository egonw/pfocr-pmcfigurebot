caption: Activation of the STING (stimulator of the interferon genes) pathway mitigated
  the inhibitory effects of GSDME (gasdermin E) knockdown on ox-LDL(oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein)-induced endothelial inflammation. HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells), post-transfection with either si-NC (scramble interfering RNA) or si-GSDME
  (GSDME siRNA), underwent a pretreatment of 3.6 μmol/L SR-717 or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)
  for 1 h. These cells were then exposed to 100 μg/mL of ox-LDL or PBS (phosphate
  buffer saline) for a duration of 24 h before proceeding with the subsequent assays.
  (A) Representative Western blot image of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (intercellular
  adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and β-actin; (B,C)
  quantification of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, normalized to β-actin, respectively, n = 6;
  (D) representative image of THP-1 cells (green) adhering to HUVECs, scale bars indicate
  150 µm; (E) quantitative statistical assessment of adhered THP-1 cell counts, n
  = 6; (F) representative Western blot image of phosphorylated and total levels of
  STING, TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor-3), NF-κB
  p65 (nuclear factor kappa-B p65)), and β-actin; (G–J) relative quantifications of
  the phosphorylated forms to their corresponding total proteins, n = 6.
