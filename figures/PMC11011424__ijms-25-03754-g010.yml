caption: Effects of ML385 on HCE-2 cell viability, Nrf2 levels, and its transcriptional
  activity. Cell viability was not affected by ML385 (0, 1, 5 and 10 μM) at 24 or
  48 h of exposure (A,B). Western blot data showed a significant reduction in Nrf2
  protein by ML385 (10 μM) at 24 h, which was further reduced by PM10 (C). ML385 (10
  μM) significantly reduced the mRNA levels of downstream targets of Nrf2 signaling,
  GPX4 (D), and NQO1 (E) 24 h after treatment. Data are presented as mean + SD. (***
  p < 0.001, n = 3).
