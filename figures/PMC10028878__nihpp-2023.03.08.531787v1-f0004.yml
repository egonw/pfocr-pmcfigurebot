figure_title: GSDMD is associated with inflammatory gene expression programs
caption: A Principal component analysis comparing WT and GSDMD KO RNA samples. B Volcano
  plot of differential gene expression comparing WT vs GSDMD KO. Purple, 812 genes
  upregulated in WT vs KO; Green, 447 genes downregulated in WT vs KO. C Heat map
  for top genes that show differential expression between GSDMD KOs and WT D Genes
  decreased in KO versus WT were subjected to pathway and ontology analysis. The top
  ten most significant GO Biological Processes are shown (-Log10 p-Elim pruning value
  is graphed) and the significant REACTOME gene set enrichments are shown (p<0.05).
  All differentially expressed genes were examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  and the top five most significant Canonical Pathways are shown. E Heat map for genes
  from the top most significant GO Biological Process as shown in D (Defense response
  to virus).
