caption: 'DS cells exhibit a markedly enhanced glycolytic and impaired Krebs cycle
  fluxomic profile compared to healthy control cells; effect of AOAA. Isotopologues
  present in the distal steps of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, as well as steps
  of serine biosynthesis are shown in n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts and
  n = 8 DS fibroblasts, as summarized in , with/without AOAA treatment (3 μM). **p ≤ 0.01
  indicates significant differences between DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05,
  ##p ≤ 0.01 indicates significant differences between DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
