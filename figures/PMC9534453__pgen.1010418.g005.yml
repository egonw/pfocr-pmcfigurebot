figure_title: SLC2A1 and GLIS2 are the direct targets of miR-275 and miR-305, respectively
caption: '(A) Heatmap of relative expression levels of candidate targets in antagomiR
  groups (Ant-275 or Ant-305) and the negative control (Ant-NC). The number in each
  cell represents the mean value of the relative expression. Solid and hollow circles
  indicate significantly up-regulated and down-regulated target genes upon antagomiR
  treatment, respectively (P < 0.05). (B-C) Validation of candidate target genes by
  yeast-refeeding strategy. (B) miR-275. (C) miR-305. “yeast-” and “yeast+” indicate
  the absence and presence of yeast in the diet for 6 days, respectively, while “refed”
  indicates a 4-day yeast-free diet followed by a 2-day yeast-rich diet (refed). ANOVA:
  *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. (D) Luciferase reporter assays of candidate
  targets (LOC6469, SLC2A1, MUC5AC, KCTD151, GLIS2, and SV2A) in vitro. (E-F) Abolishment
  of repression effect by binding site mutation. (E) miR-275-SLC2A1 binding site mutation.
  (F) miR-305-GLIS2 binding site mutation. (G-H) Immunoprecipitation (RIP) of miRNA
  and their target genes in vivo. (G) RIP of miR-275 and SLC2A1. (H) RIP of miR-305
  and GLIS2. Fold enrichment was quantitated relative to IgG control. (I-J) Relative
  expression of SLC2A1 and GLIS2 in the heterozygous mutant and wild-type flies. Data
  are expressed as means ± SEM. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; and ****,
  P < 0.0001 (Student’s t-test).'
