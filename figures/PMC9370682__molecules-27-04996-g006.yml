caption: Effects of compound H12 on cell proliferation. For Aâ€“C, MGC-803 cells were
  treated with indicated concentrations of compound H12 for 48 h. For D, MGC-803 cells
  were treated with indicated concentrations of compound H12 for 7 days. (A,B) Cell
  cycle distribution of treated MGC-803 cells. (C) Levels of cell cycle-related proteins
  in treated MGC-803 cells. (D) The colonies that formatted after treatment with compound
  H12 in MGC-803 cells.
