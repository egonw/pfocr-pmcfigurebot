caption: 'Liver lipid deposition of SD rats after the intervention. Lipid deposition
  in the liver of hyperlipidemic rats was determined by ORO staining (three independent
  experiments were conducted for each sample) (n = 6). (A) Typical liver pictures
  of rats in each group; (B) Liver oil red staining (×100, 400); (C) Analysis of oil
  red staining area of rats in each group; (D) The average weight of the liver of
  the rats in each group; (E) Hepatic TG levels measured using the colorimetric method.
  Compared with the selected group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 or ****P < 0.0001;
  (D) Compared with the HFD group: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001; compared
  with the HFD + CC + Moxi group: ##P < 0.01. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)'
article_title: Grain-sized moxibustion at Zusanli (ST36) promotes hepatic autophagy
  in rats with hyperlipidemia by regulating the ULK1 and TFEB expression through the
  AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
