figure_title: ANXA9 and S100A4 regulates apoptosis through modulating STAT3
caption: A, B ANXA9 regulated protein expression of cleaved-caspase3 and cleaved-caspase9
  in BC cells; C, D ANXA9 regulated protein expression of p53, Bcl-2 and Bax in BC
  cells; E, F S100A4 affected the protein expression of p53, Bcl-2 and Bax in BC cells;
  G, H ANXA9 affected the AKT/STAT3/ mTOR signal pathway; I, J S100A4 affected the
  AKT/STAT3/ mTOR signal pathway. All of the experiments were replicated for three
  times.
article_title: ANXA9 facilitates S100A4 and promotes breast cancer progression through
  modulating STAT3 pathway.
