caption: HPGDS-related gene enrichment analysis. (A) Experimentally determined HPGDS-binding
  proteins were identified using STRING. (B) The correlations of the expression of
  HPGDS and the five most related genes in cancers are shown. (C) An analysis of the
  intersections of genes encoding HPGDS-binding proteins and expression-correlated
  genes was conducted. (D) KEGG pathway analyses were performed on the genes encoding
  HPGDS-binding proteins and expression-correlated genes. (E) GO analyses were also
  performed.
