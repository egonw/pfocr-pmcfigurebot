figure_title: Exercise training impact analysis of untargeted metabolomics performed
  in serum and liver from adult and old mice
caption: a Serum and c liver metabolite profiles from adult (left panel) and old (right
  panel) mice were analyzed by Partial Least Square Determinant Analysis (PLS-DA).
  The ellipses correspond to 95% confidence intervals for a normal distribution. Each
  principal component is labeled with the corresponding percent values. Black symbols,
  Sedentary controls; red symbols, HIIT; blue symbols, MICT. b, d Correlation coefficients
  of the top 25 metabolites that correlated positively (orange bars) and negatively
  (green bars) as a function of exercise for serum (b) and liver (d). The impact of
  exercise (e) and age (f) vis-à-vis pathway enrichment and their network topology
  from the liver metabolome is depicted. y-axis, enrichment significance; x-axis,
  pathway impact for network topology. Blue line highlights pathways significantly
  impacted as defined by enrichment significance p ≤ 0.05 [−log (p) > 1.3] and fdr ≤ 0.05.
