caption: Time dependence of hUCN1‐induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation by western blotting.
  A marked increase in PKB/Akt phosphorylation was measured in the presence of 10 nM
  hUCN1 that peaked 1 h after the start of the treatment. The membrane was reprobed
  for total Akt, which served as loading control. Relative protein phosphorylation
  was determined by the phosphorylated/total signal ratio. The values shown are presented
  by box + whiskers plots, indicating median (central horizontal line), min/max values,
  and mean (with ‘+’ within the box) of four independently performed experiments (n = 4).
  *P < 0.05 vs. Control (one‐way ANOVA, Dunnett).
