caption: HULC targets miR-3200-5p and acts as a ceRNA. (a, b) Results of high-throughput
  sequencing identified a total of 9 significant differential genes. (c) Results of
  GO analysis revealed that target genes were related to selenocysteine lyase activity,
  peroxisomal mechanism targeting signal-1 binding, and tumor necrosis factor receptor
  superfamily binding. (d) KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that selenium compound
  metabolism and neuroactive ligand receptor interaction along with the Wnt and JAK-STAT
  signaling pathways were the most abundant. (e) Results from the target prediction
  indicated that HULC might interact with miR-3200-5p. (f) qRT-PCR was performed to
  assess gene changes in miR-3200-5p after knockdown of HULC. (g) When the mimic miR-3200-5p
  was added, a decrease in HULC expression was observed in BEL-7402 and SMMC-7721
  cells. Three independent experiments and sample size (n = 3), compared with the
  control group; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
