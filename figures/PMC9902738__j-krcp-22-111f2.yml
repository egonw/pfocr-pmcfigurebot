figure_title: The potential benefits of cinnamon to patients with diabetes, obesity,
  or CVDs
caption: Cinnamon can provide physiological benefits by mimicking insulin action through
  insulin receptor autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of tyrosine and promoting
  glucose transporter (GLUT) translocation via the 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Cinnamaldehyde has antidiabetic activity
  through upregulation of the insulin signaling pathway, induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptors (PPARs), and inhibition of α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase. Cinnamon
  may increase the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), promoting thermogenesis.
  It can also reduce hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c
  (SREBP-1c) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and upregulate PPAR-α, fatty acid
  synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), and nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) to promote cytoprotective effects and reduce inflammation.
  Cinnamaldehyde might act as a natural agonist of transient receptor-ankyrin receptor
  1 (TRPA1), reducing ghrelin secretion and food intake. Cinnamon may decrease SREBP-1
  and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) expression and increase expression of PPAR-γ,
  reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory burden and, therefore, cardiovascular risk.LXR-α,
  liver X receptor alpha; CVD, cardiovascular disease.
