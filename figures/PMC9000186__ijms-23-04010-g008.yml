caption: 'S1P-induced signaling pathways regulate cell proliferation, inflammation
  and fibrosis in oxidant-induced kidney injury. Cell proliferation: SphK1 promotes
  cell proliferation via ERK/PI3K/Akt/PKB and TGF-β1, while SphK2 reduces it by inhibiting
  ERK/PI3K/Akt/PKB. SphK1 activates PDGF by activating ERK, leading to cell proliferation.
  PDGF promotes cell proliferation by activating SphK1, while this event is inhibited
  by COX-2. Binding of IGF-II to M6P/IGF-IIR activates ERK through PKC-mediated SphK1
  activity, leading to cell proliferation. Inflammation: SphK1/S1P reduces inflammation
  by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) or by activating HIF-1α
  and HSP27. In contrast, SphK2 enhances inflammation by increasing TGF-β1 expression,
  inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β). SphK2 together with Fyn promotes inflammation
  via STAT3/Akt pathway. Renal fibrosis: both SphK1 and SphK2 promote renal fibrosis
  via the activation of ERK/TGF-β1/CK2α/NF-κB and via Fyn-STAT3/Akt/TGF-β1, respectively.
  SphK1 also promotes fibrosis by inhibiting PP2A. Abbreviations; CK2α; casein kinase
