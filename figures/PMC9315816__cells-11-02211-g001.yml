caption: 'Informatics Pipeline and Mapping of Genes to Neural Circuits: (A) Schemati
  representation of the informatic pipeline analysis (B) 2631 neurodevelopmental genes,
  including 594 from pathogenic CNVs of autism subjects, were analyzed via KEGG and
  Panther pathway analysesProminent signaling pathways which use MAPK, RAS, and tyrosine
  receptor kinases were common to both analyses. (C) After proteinâ€“protein interactions
  were evaluated via String and mRNA Co-expression analyses, 121 genes were mapped
  for their antenatal/postnatal expression in Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-defined
  neural circuits using Brodmann areas.'
