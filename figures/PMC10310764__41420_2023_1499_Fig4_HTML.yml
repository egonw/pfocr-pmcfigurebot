figure_title: UBE3A is required for miR-375-induced inhibition of the malignant phenotype
  of LUSC by inactivating the ERK pathway
caption: A qRT‒PCR and B western blot showing the mRNA and protein levels of UBE3A
  in SK-MES-1 cells transfected with UBE3A and/or miR-375 expression vector(s) and
  in NCI-H2170 cells transfected with shUBE3A#1 and/or sp miR-375 vector(s). C A CCK-8
  assay was used to determine the cell viability at the indicated time points in SK-MES-1
  cells transfected with UBE3A and/or miR-375 expression vector(s) and in NCI-H2170
  cells transfected with shUBE3A#1 and/or sp miR-375 vector(s). D The proliferation
  of SK-MES-1 cells transfected with UBE3A and/or miR-375 expression vector(s) and
  NCI-H2170 cells transfected with shUBE3A#1 and/or sp miR-375 vector(s) was determined
  by EdU assay, magnification ×100. E Flow cytometry analyses of cell apoptosis in
  SK-MES-1 cells transfected with UBE3A and/or miR-375 expression vector(s) and in
  NCI-H2170 cells transfected with shUBE3A#1 and/or sp miR-375 vector(s). F Transwell
  assay and G wound-healing assay were used to test the migration and invasion of
  SK-MES-1 cells in response to overexpression of miR-375 and/or UBE3A and NCI-H2170
  in response to suppression of miR-375 and/or UBE3A, magnification ×100. H Protein
  expression of p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, BAX, BCL2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, MMP2 and MMP9
  was determined by western blots in SK-MES-1 cells transfected with UBE3A and/or
  miR-375 expression vector(s) and in NCI-H2170 cells transfected with shUBE3A#1 and/or
  sp miR-375 vector(s). GAPDH was used as a loading control.
