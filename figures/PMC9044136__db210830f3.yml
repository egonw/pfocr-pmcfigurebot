caption: 'Identification and extraction of endothelial cell clusters within the skin
  samples of individuals with diabetes and without diabetes. A: Identification and
  extraction of the endothelial cell cluster in human skin by visualizing the expression
  level of CDH5, VWF, and PECAM1 gene expression enrichment (Supplementary Fig. 4A).
  B: tSNE plots showing nonsignificant difference of VEGF ligands between diabetic
  and nondiabetic skin endothelial cells (VEGFC, FDR-adjusted P value: 1; VEGFB, adjusted
  P value: 1; VEGFA, not expressed in >20% of the cells in either group). C: tSNE
  plots showing nonsignificant difference of VEGF receptors between diabetic and nondiabetic
  skin endothelial cells (KDR, FDR-adjusted P value: 1; FLT1, FDR-adjusted P value:
  0.04, logFC < ±0.25; FLT4, not expressed in >20% of the cells in either group).
  D: GSEA showing that the VEGF signaling was not significantly altered between diabetic
  and nondiabetic skin endothelial cells (normalized enrichment score [NES] −0.43;
  P = 0.4). E: Signaling interaction analysis of VEGF pathway across different cell
  types in diabetic and nondiabetic skin. E, top: VEGF signaling network in nondiabetic
  (left) and diabetic (right) skin. E, bottom: Ligands and receptors contributed in
  VEGF signaling in nondiabetic (left) and diabetic (right) skin cells. F: tSNE plots
  showing PLCγ2 expression level between nondiabetic (left) and diabetic (right) skin
  endothelial cells (logFC: −0.52; FDR-adjusted P value: 5.98E-100). Immunohistochemical
  analysis of VWF+/PLCγ2+ colocalization in human nondiabetic and diabetic skin (G)
  and its colocalization coefficient (H). Scale bars, 50 µm. n = 9 and 7. *P < 0.05
  (Student t test). Data are represented as the mean ± SEM.'
