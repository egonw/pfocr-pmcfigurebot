caption: 'Heterozygous losses impacting key DNA repair effectors are enriched in MYBL2
  High tumors. (A) Weighted expression scores reveal an imbalance in DNA repair pathway
  regulation. (B) Observed differences in WE scores are highly correlated across different
  cancer types. Correlations with x marks indicate correlations that are not statistically
  significant (Pearson). (C) Heterozygous losses in genes encoding key single-strand
  break repair, TLS, and NHEJ effectors are highly enriched in MYBL2 High tumors.
  One-sided Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.05, *; p < 0.01, **; p < 0.001, ***. Heterozygous
  loss events are highly correlated with decreased expression of repair effectors.
  Benjamini-Hochberg corrected q. q < 0.05, *; q < 0.01, **, q < 0.001, ***. (D) COSMIC
  v3.2 SBS analysis reveals heterozygous loss of repair effectors is associated with
  impaired pathway function. S: Signatures specifically observed only in MYBL2 High
  or MYBL2 Low tumors. Dotted line represents Student’s t-test p = 0.05.'
