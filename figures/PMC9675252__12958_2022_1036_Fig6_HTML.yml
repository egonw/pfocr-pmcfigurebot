caption: 'TARID activated the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway through CXCL3. a Results
  of western blotting showing the expression of ERK and p-ERK in HTR8/SVneo cells
  transfected with vector-CXCL3 or vector and si-CXCL3 or si-NC. b Results of western
  blotting showing the expression of ERK and p-ERK in HTR8/SVneo cells transfected
  with vector-TARID or vector and ASO-TARID or ASO. c Results of western blotting
  showing the expression of CXCL3, ERK and p-ERK in HTR8/SVneo cells co-transfected
  with vector-TARID and si-CXCL3. d Results of western blotting showing the expression
  of CXCL3, ERK and p-ERK in HTR8/SVneo cells co-transfected with ASO-TARID and vector-CXCL3.
  All experiments were conducted in triplicate; the values are shown as the mean ± SEM;
  vs. vector or ASO，**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05; vs. vector-TARID + si-NC or ASO-TARID +
  vector, ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.05'
