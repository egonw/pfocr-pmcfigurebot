caption: Diagram summarizing the mechanism of the IL-17A/NF-kB pathway in breast cancer
  metastasis and other organs like the brain. IL-17A can be secreted by breast cancer
  (BC) cells and many cells in the breast cancer microenvironment such as tumor-associated
  macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, Th-17 cell, γδT cells, and endothelial
  cells. In turn, IL-17 and other Th-17 derived cytokines influence the tumor microenvironment
  by directly promoting transformed cell properties and the nearby stromal cell activity.
  IL-17A binds with IL-17RA–IL-17RC receptor and transduces signaling via the adaptor
  protein nuclear factor (NF)-k activator (Act1). Many IL-17 target genes contain
  the promoter’s region that binds with NF-kB. In turn, the NF-kB signal pathway tend
  to be activated and promote the expression of genes encoded for angiogenesis and
  metastasis. The major steps of bone metastatic BC include extravasation, circulatory
  journey, extravasation in distant sites, and ultimately metastatic colonization
  of bone or other target organs (brain, lung, and liver).
