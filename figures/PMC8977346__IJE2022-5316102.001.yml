caption: ASPM is upregulated in ATC patients and cell lines. (a) The expression of
  ASPM in ATC patients based on the data extracted from data sets GSE76039 and GSE33630.
  (b) The mRNA levels of ASPM in ATC (anaplastic thyroid cancer), PTC (papillary thyroid
  cancer), and normal thyroid tissues from enrolled patients. (c) The protein levels
  of ASPM in ATC, PTC, and normal thyroid tissues from enrolled patients. (d) The
  mRNA levels of ASPM in ATC cell lines. (e) The protein levels of ASPM in ATC cell
  lines. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
