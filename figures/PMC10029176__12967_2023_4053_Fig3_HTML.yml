caption: Comparison of statistical characteristics of NAT- and tumor-DEGs. A Bar plot
  of the GO functional terms of NAT-DEGs and tumor-DEGs. Black-dashed lines represent
  P = 0.05. B Box plot of the result of single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) of ‘dormancy’
  signatures, ‘premetastatic niche’ signatures, and ‘proliferation’ signatures. The
  significance of the difference between RC and nonRC states was measured by Wilcoxon
  rank sum test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Refer to the Methods section
  for where each signature comes from. D_1, dormancy-associated genes from dormancy
  study_1; D_2_C, classical dormancy-associated genes from dormancy study_2; D_2_SC,
  dormancy-related genes revealed by the single cell analysis from dormancy study_2;
  D_2_HIPPO, Hippo pathway genes from dormancy study_2; D_2_TGF, TGF-beta pathway
  from dormancy study_2; D_2_WNT, WNT signaling pathway from dormancy study_2; PN_ST_d,
  stroma-derived ‘premetastatic niche’-associated genes; PN_T_d, tumor-derived ‘premetastatic
  niche’-associated genes; PN_ST_T_d, stroma- and tumor-derived ‘premetastatic niche’-associated
  genes; CP_GO, ‘cell proliferation’-associated genes from GO terms
article_title: Transcriptomes of the tumor-adjacent normal tissues are more informative
  than tumors in predicting recurrence in colorectal cancer patients.
