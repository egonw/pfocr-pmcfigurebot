caption: Model for phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-induced
  fatty liver disease. Light blue, red, and dark blue are three different PE/PC membrane
  disruption pathways. Light blue shows the effects of a low choline diet, which significantly
  lowers intracellular PC levels due to lack of its primary reactant. The liver will
  try to compensate for this lowering by increasing extracellular PE. Red shows the
  effects of disrupting the PEMT pathway, which significantly decreases TAG secretion
  and increases TAG intracellular accumulation. Dark blue shows the effects of silencing
  the expression of mitochondrial protein Mfn2. In the ER, PS is converted to PE,
  which is then sent into the mitochondria for modification to PC. Knocking out this
  membrane protein causes a NAFLD/NASH phenotype due to the halting of PE and PC creation.
  All three disruptions upset the intracellular PE/PC ratio, which in turn causes
  membrane destabilization.
