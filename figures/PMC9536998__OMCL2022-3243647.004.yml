caption: '(a) Left: MMP-3 expression between normal tissue and the PDA tissue; Right:
  MMP-3 expression between normal PDA patients and the person with diabetes (DM) PDA
  patients (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001). (b) ROC curve of MMP-3 predicting the overall
  survival of PDA patients in 1-year, 3-years, and 5-years. AUC (area under the curve)
  measures the predicting efficacy of MMP-3 in different time models. (c) K-M survival
  plot of the high MMP-3 group, and the low MMP-3 group in the TCGA pancreatic cancer
  cohort (left) and TCGA PDA gemcitabine users (right). (d, e) GSEA analysis of pathways
  enriched in high MMP-3 group. (f) GO and KEGG analyses of the pathways enriched
  in high MMP-3 group. (g, h) Heat map of the association between the single genes
  (ENT1 (SLC29A1), ENT3 (SLC29A3), CNT1 (SLC28A1), CNT3 (SLC28A3), RRM1, RRM2, MRP1
  (ABCB1), NOX1, NOX4, and PLK1) expression and the MMP-3 expression in PDA cohort
  (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001). (i) The expression of NOX4, RRM1, RRM2, CNT1, and CNT3
  in 100 U MMP-3 treated pancreatic cancer cell line and normal control group from
  GSE50931 (ns: not significant (P > 0.05), ∗P < 0.05).'
