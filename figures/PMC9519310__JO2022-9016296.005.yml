caption: Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation further activates the IFNγ/JAK/STAT1
  signalling pathway. (a)–(d) The relative proteins expressions of difference groups
  in NSCLC cells (H1299, PC-9, H1975 and H3255) by western blotting assay. (e)–(h)
  qRT-PCR was used to analyse the mRNA expression levels of relative genes in NSCLC
  cells (H1299, H1975, PC9, H3255) treated combined with or without IFNγ/STAT3 inhibitor.
  All data were illustrated as mean ± SD and the asterisks show significant difference.
