caption: 'TAL1-AKTE17K pro-T and leukemic cells are more sensitive to PI3K inhibition
  compared to AKTE17K only cells. (A) Dose response curves showing relative (to dimethyl
  sulfoxide [DMSO] concentration) viability of leukemic cells in response to 24 hours
  of treatment with increasing concentrations of PI3K-mTOR inhibitor Dactolisib and
  AKT inhibitor MK2206. Thymic mouse cells (left): m267 (AKTE17K), m271 (TAL1+AKTE17K)
  and Cas9 pro-T cells (right). (B) Bar plots showing half maximal inhibitory concentration
  (IC50) values for different Leukemic cells/ pro-T cell conditions treated with PI3k-mTOR
  inhibitor Dactolisib and AKT inhibitor MK2206. P-values were calculated using the
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction to account for multiple comparisons.'
