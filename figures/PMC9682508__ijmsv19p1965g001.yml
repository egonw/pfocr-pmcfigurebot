  models. n=3. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment of top 10 up-regulated signaling pathway
  in IoN-CCI rat models. (F) Gene expression of RIPK1 mRNA levels in indicated groups
  of RSC96 cells. (G) Protein levels of RIPK1, phosphorylated RIPK1 at Serine 166
  sites and Serine 321 sites in indicated groups of RSC96 cells.
