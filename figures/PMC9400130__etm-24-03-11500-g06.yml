caption: Biological function and pathway annotation enrichment analysis. (A) Bubble
  plot of GO enrichment analysis of the 44 BCR-associated DEGs revealing the enriched
  BP, CC and MF. (B) DO enrichment analysis of the 44 BCR-associated DEGs showing
  the enriched top 10 diseases. (C) KEGG pathway analysis revealed the enriched signaling
  pathways of the 44 BCR-associated DEGs. (D) GSEA showed the top five KEGG signaling
  pathways in BCR-PCa of the GEO-merged dataset. (E) GSEA enrichment analysis showed
  the top six KEGG signaling pathways in BCR-PCa in TCGA-PRAD dataset. GO, Gene Ontology;
  BCR, biochemical recurrence; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; BP, biological
  processes; CC, cellular components; MF, molecular functions; DO, Disease Ontology;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  PCa, prostate cancer; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus.
