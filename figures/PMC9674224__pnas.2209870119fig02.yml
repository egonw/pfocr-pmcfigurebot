caption: 'HHIP is expressed by habenular cholinergic neurons. (A) Graphical representation
  of TRAP-seq procedure to identify L10a-associated mRNAs undergoing translation in
  MHbChat neurons using ChATDW167 mice, which were screened against GWAS Catalog using
  Enrichr. (B) Sixty-one of the most abundantly translated genes in MHbChat neurons
  are associated with increased risk of smoking-related behaviors or disease. Genes
  in pink are expressed more densely in MHb relative to other brain regions. (C) Representative
  RNA-seq reads of L10a-associated transcripts in MHbChat neurons aligned to Hhip
  gene (Left). (D) Relative Hhip reads (mean ± SEM) in MHbChat neurons from TRAP-seq
  of ChATDW167 mice (n = 9) and in MHb tissue from RNA-seq of habenula tissue from
  wild-type mice (MHb; n = 6); ***P < 0.001, unpaired two-sided t test. (E, Left)
  Coronal brain slice from C57BL6J mouse showing RNAscope in situ hybridization of
  Hhip, Chat, and Olig2 transcripts, with right hemisphere MHb identified by white
  box. (E, Right) High-magnification images of the same right hemisphere of MHb identified
  by white demarcation lines. (F) Pearson coefficient of Hhip expression in cells
  that coexpressed Chat, Olig2, or neither of these transcripts. (G) Graphical representation
  of experimental procedure to investigate the effect of acute nicotine injection
  (1 mg⋅kg−1 SC) on habenular HHIP expression. (H) Normalized Hhip expression in MHb
  of mice injected with saline or nicotine (n = 6 per group); main effect of nicotine
  in one-way ANOVA: F(2, 9) = 19.12, P = 0.0006; ***P = 0.007 compared with saline-treated
  mice, Tukey multiple comparison test. (I) Graphical representation of septal inputs
  to MHb–IPn circuit and the two major population of α5 nAChR-expressing neurons contained
  in IPn (α5Amigo and α5Epyc neurons). Sm, stria medullaris; Fr, fasciculus retroflexus.
  (J) Heat map of normalized TRAP-seq reads of Hedgehog pathway gene transcripts contained
  in MHbChat, α5Amigo, or α5Epyc neurons. Shh, sonic hedgehog; Ihh, Indian hedgehog;
  Dhh, desert hedgehog; Wnt7b, wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member
  7b. (K) Fluorescence micrograph of HHIP protein expression (green) in MHb of mice.
  Cell nuclei are highlighted by DAPI staining (blue). (Scale bar: 100 μM.) (L) Micrograph
  of PTCH-1 protein expression (red) in MHb of mice. PVT, paraventricular nucleus
  of thalamus. (Scale bar: 100 μM.) (M) Immunofluorescent images of PTCH-1 protein
  expression in NDB: Nucleus of the Diagonal Band. (Scale bar: 100 μM.) (N) PTCH-1
  in MS: Medial Septum. (O and P) Whole-brain slides identifying GLI1-driven β-gal
  activity (blue stain; identified by black arrows) in adult Gli1LacZ reporter mice
  injected with saline (O) or nicotine (1 mg⋅kg−1 per) (P) on three consecutive days
  and assessed 24 h after final injection. Areas of MHb and septum in boxes (i and
  ii, respectively) from saline- and nicotine-treated mice are shown in higher magnification
  in bottom panels. (Q) Graphical representation of GLI1 lentireporter. (R) GLI-driven
  luciferase activity in ex vivo brain slices of rats expressing the GLI-lentireporter
  in IPn and treated with vehicle (n = 4) or recombinant Shh protein (n = 9). Main
  effect of Shh protein: F(1, 11) = 0.6668, P = 0.4315; main effect of time: F(2.917,
  32.09) = 1.935, P = 0.1451; interaction effect: F(4, 44) = 0.5448, P = 0.7037. (S)
  Graphical representation of IPn cannulation and injection of recombinant HHIP protein
  (100 ng) into the IPn of nicotine self-administering rats. (T) Number of nicotine
  rewards (0.12 mg⋅kg−1 per infusion) earned by rats after intra-IPn injection of
  vehicle (n = 12) or HHIP (n = 6); P = 0.6704, unpaired two-sided t test.'
