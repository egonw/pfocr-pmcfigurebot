figure_title: The downregulation of circ-Pank1 in the MN9D cell model alleviates the
  damage to dopaminergic neurons by reducing the expression of a-syn
caption: A, C Western blot analysis of the protein levels of α-syn in the SN of PD
  model mice treated with rotenone (n = 4). D qRT–PCR to detect the expression of
  α-syn mRNA in the SN of PD model mice treated with rotenone (n = 4). B–F After si-circ-Pank1
  and the corresponding control were transferred to the MN9D cell model treated with
  rotenone (n = 3), Western blot analysis of the protein level of α-syn (B, E) and
  qRT–PCR detection of the mRNA expression of α-syn F. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
