caption: 'Genes in ID4 and stem cell/EMT pathways predict sensitivity to MK2206. Upper
  panel: Heatmap of pathway analysis showing relative expression of various genes
  in ID4 pathway in different breast tumor lines. Tumor lines are arranged based on
  MK2206 sensitivity. The cell line on the left (EVSA-T) is the most sensitive to
  MK2206. Lower panel: Heatmap showing relative expression of various genes in stem
  cell/EMT pathway. Table: Using cosmic analysis with multiple regression method,
  the data indicate that the expression values of each gene within the set (ID4, stem
  cell/EMT) are able to predict the MK2206 sensitivity for each cell line tested.'
