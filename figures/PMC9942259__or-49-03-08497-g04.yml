caption: LAPTM5 promotes tumorigenesis of breast cancer in vivo. (A and B) Tumor volume
  of xenografts in mice injected with LAPTM5-overexcpressed T-47D or sh-LAPTM5 MDA-MB-231
  was measured every 3 days until day 27. (C) Images of xenografts cultured for 27
  days. (D) The expression of KI67 and LAPTM5 in xenografts was detected by immunohistochemistry.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. (E) Protein expression of LAPTM5, CyclinD1 and MMP9 in xenografts
  was evaluated by western blot analysis. Data originated from three independent experiments
  and are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. LAPTM5, lysosomal protein
  transmembrane 5; MMP, matrix metallopeptidase; ns, not significant; sh-, short hairpin;
  NC, negative control.
article_title: LAPTM5 regulated by FOXP3 promotes the malignant phenotypes of breast
  cancer through activating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.
