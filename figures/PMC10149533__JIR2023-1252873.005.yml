caption: 'Morroniside treatment affects the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in EIU mice.
  (a) Inflammation in each group observed under slit lamp microscopy (frontal and
  lateral views). (b) Observation of hematoxylin–eosin staining in ciliary body and
  retinal tissues (100×, scale bar, 200 μm). (c) Expression of Arg-1 in the ciliary
  body and retinal tissues of mice (40×, scale bar, 20 μm). (d) Expression of iNOS
  in the ciliary body and retinal tissues of mice (40×, scale bar, 20 μm). (e, g)
  Protein expression of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 in ciliary body tissues.
  (f, g) Protein expression of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 in retinal tissues.
  Means ± SD from three independent samples are shown. Data in western blot assays
  were expressed after normalization to β-actin levels. Comparison with the control
  group:  ∗∗P < 0.01; comparison with the EIU group: #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01; comparison
  with the AG490 group: ΔP < 0.05.'
