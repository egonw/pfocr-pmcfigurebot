caption: miR-206 targeted NRSN2. A) Pan-Cer database showed that miR-206 and NRSN2
  were negatively correlated in sarcomas. B) The binding sites between miR-206 and
  NRSN2 were predicted using Starbase database. The targeted binding of miR-206 and
  NRSN2 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. C-E) The NRSN2 mRNA level
  in BMCs-EVs/human osteoblasts hFOB 1.19 and OS cells 143B, MG-63, Saos2 and HOS/143B
  cells in each treatment group was detected by RT-qPCR. Three cell tests were performed
  and the data were expressed as mean Â± SD (A). Independent t-test was used for comparison
  between two groups in (B) and one-way ANOVA was used for comparison among groups
  in (C-E). Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used for post-hoc test; **p<0.01.
