caption: Functional annotation of m5C clusters. (a) The network and the top 20 significantly
  enriched biological pathways in the m5C clusters. (b) The GSVA between m5C clusters
  2 and m5C clusters 3 using hallmark gene sets. (c–h) GSEA showed that the “cellular
  response to reactive oxygen species,” “melanin biosynthetic process,” “cell cycle
  DNA replication,” “angiogenesis,” “Wnt signaling pathway,” and “p53 signaling pathway”
  were significantly enriched in m5C cluster 3.
