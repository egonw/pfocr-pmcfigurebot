caption: Functional enrichment of DEGs in SA. (A) Biological processes and associated
  pathways that are important for shrimp allergic pathogenesis and development are
  plotted in bubble chart. The y-axis is KEGG pathway, x-axis is rich factor. (B)
  DEGs associated with lipid metabolism, immune system, and inflammatory signaling
  pathways in SA group.
