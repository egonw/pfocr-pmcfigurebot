caption: Experimental design. (A) Mice were operated and recovered for 7 days. Kainic
  acid (KA) was stereotaxically injected into the hippocampus. After 3 days of resting,
  melatonin (MEL) was injected intraperitoneally. Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings
  were then recorded after treatment of MEL. While learning and cognitive abilities
  were evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) test (15 days after MEL injection). In
  addition, brain tissue samples were harvested for biochemical testing or pathological
  analysis on Days 7 and 15 after MEL injection. (B) The scheme for stereotactic injection
  of the drug.
