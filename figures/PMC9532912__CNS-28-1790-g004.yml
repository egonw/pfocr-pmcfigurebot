caption: 'Zinc facilitates the activation of astrocytes in ischemic cerebral tissue.
  (A) Representative staining images for Fluozin‐3 (green), GFAP (red), and DAPI (blue).
  (B) Typical images of Fluozin‐3 staining in the ischemic hemispheres and nonischemic
  hemispheres or zinc‐treated rats. Quantitative analysis of the number of Fluozinc‐3‐positive
  cells that were counted in each rat. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity
  in Fluozin‐3‐positive cells in each group. (C) Costaining of GFAP (red) and DAPI
  (blue). (D) GFAP fluorescence intensity statistics. (E) Costaining of GFAP (red),
  BrdU (green), and DAPI (blue). (F) Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity
  in GFAP/BrdU‐positive cells in each group. (G) The representative bands of GFAP
  using Western blot. (H) Quantitative analysis of GFAP. (Scale bars: 20 μm, field
  size:40 × 40 μm2), ns p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005. Data are expressed as mean ± SD
  (n = 3/group)'
