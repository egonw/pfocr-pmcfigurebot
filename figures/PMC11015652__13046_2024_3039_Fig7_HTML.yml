caption: The mTORC1/ERO1α/IL-6/STAT3/SLC7A11 signaling pathway exists in human cancer.
  A and B LIU-LSC-1 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing shRNAs targeting
  Raptor (shRaptor1 and shRapator2) or a control shRNA (shSc). Cell lysates were subjected
  to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (A), ERO1α and SLC7A11 mRNA levels
  were detected by qRT–PCR (B). C 12 paired LSCC tissues and the corresponding ANM
  tissues were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. D Representative
  IHC images of p-S6, ERO1α, IL-6, p-STAT3, and SLC7A11 staining from the LSCC tissues
  and ANM tissues. Scale bar, 20 μm. E–I LIU-LSC-1 were infected with lentiviruses
  expressing shRNAs targeting ERO1α (shERO1α1 and shERO1α2) or a non-targeting shRNA
  (shSc). E The protein and mRNA levels of ERO1α and SLC7A11 were determined by western
  blotting and qRT–PCR. F and G CCK-8 (F) and colony formation (G) assays were performed
  to evaluate cell growth. H and I The pro-angiogenic effect of ERO1α was detected
  by tube formation (H) and CAM assays (I). Representative images (left panels) and
  quantifications (right panels) are shown. J Cell viability of indicated cells following
  treatment with erastin for 24 h. K Representative phase-contrast images of indicated
  cells were treated with erastin (15 μM) in the absence or presence of Lip-1 (1 μM).
  The corresponding phase contrast images are shown. Scale bar, 100 μm. L–N The indicated
  cells were treated with or without erastin (15 μM) for 24 h, and then intracellular
  MDA (L), L-ROS (M), and intracellular GSH (N) were measured. O–R Tumor images (O),
  tumor volume (P), and tumor weight (Q) of shERO1α.1 LIU-LSC-1 xenograft tumors (n = 5
  mice/group) treated with Lip-1 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. R The relative MDA levels
  of the indicated tumors were measured. Error bars indicate mean ± SD of triplicate
  (if mentioned otherwise) samples. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
