caption: (A) Gelatine zymography and equal loading after 24 hours of treatment of
  F6 (50 µg/ml) in A549 cells. From left to right lane denotes marker, control, DMSO,
  and F6 (50 µg/ml). (B) Gelatine zymography and equal loading after 24 hours of treatment
  of F8 (50 µg/ml) in A549 cells. From left to right lane denotes DMSO, control, and
  F8 (50 µg/ml). In each picture, the upper gel for zymography and the lower gel corresponds
  to equal loading. (C) Bar diagram of activity of MMPs obtained from 3 independent
  gelatine zymography after 24 hours of treatment of F6 (0-50 µg/ml) in A549 cells.
  (D) Bar diagram of activity of MMPs obtained from 3 independent gelatine zymography
  after 24 hours of treatment of F8 (0-50 µg/ml) in A549 cells. In both cases, the
  activity of control was taken as 100%, accordingly the activity of treated sample
  was calculated. Each bar represents the mean with the standard deviation of activity
  of MMPs from 3 independent experiments. Here “*” defines 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05.
