  caused by TNFRSF9 knockdown. (a, b) Cell proliferation assay performed in MGF-7
  cells transfected with si-TNFRSF9 and with or without p38 MAPK-IN-1, including CCK-8
  assay (a) and BrdU assay (b). (c, d) Cell proliferation assay performed in ZR-75-30
  cells transfected with si-TNFRSF9 and with or without p38 MAPK-IN-1, including CCK-8
  assay (c) and BrdU assay (d). ∗∗p < 0.01∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
