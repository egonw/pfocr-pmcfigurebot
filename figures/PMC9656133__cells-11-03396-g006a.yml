caption: Combined metabolome and transcriptome analysis. (a) PathView enrichment pathway
  diagram (positive ion mode). According to the enrichment results, the metabolic
  pathways enriched in both metabolomics and transcriptomics are shown as pathway
  maps. In the KEGG pathway diagram, circles represent metabolites; blue circles represent
  downregulated differential metabolites, and yellow circles represent upregulated
  differential metabolites. The boxes represent genes or proteins, where the green
  boxes represent genes whose expression levels are differentially downregulated and
  the red boxes represent genes whose expression levels are differentially upregulated.
  (b) PathView enrichment pathway diagram (negative ion mode).
