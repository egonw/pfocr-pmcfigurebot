caption: GSEA analysis and single-cell gene functional analysis of ERCC6L in LUAD.
  (A) Bubble plots showing the top 10 GO and KEGG pathway terms of genes co-expressed
  with ERCC6L in LUAD. (B) The top 3 KEGG pathways of genes positively co-expressed
  with ERCC6L in LUAD. ERCC6L upregulation was associated with ‘cell cycle’, ‘homologous
  recombination’ and ‘DNA replication’. (C) Gene functional analysis of ERCC6L in
  LUAD at the single-cell level. Gene expression of ERCC6L was significantly correlated
  with cell cycle, DNA repair, proliferation, DNA damage, invasion, and EMT. Spearman's
  correlation was conducted. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis;
  ERCC6L, excision repair cross-complementation group 6 like; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition.

  malignant phenotypes of lung adenocarcinoma.
