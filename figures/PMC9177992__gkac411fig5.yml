caption: 'The transcription adaptation response is induced earlier when the 5′-3′
  pathway is perturbed upstream. (A) AID-tagged proteins in this figure. Nuclear factors
  to the left - Rat1 is the nuclear 5′-3′ exoribonuclease, Nrd1, Sen1 and Nab3 survey
  aberrant transcripts and recruit the nuclear exosome (Dis3, Rrp6). Mature mRNA leaves
  the nucleus and will be deadenylated in the cytoplasm by the Ccr4–Not complex (Not1,
  Pop2, Ccr4). After deadenylation transcripts will continue to degrade 3′-5′ by the
  cytosolic exosome (Dis3), or 5′-3′ by Xrn1 after decapping by the DCP complex (Dcp2).
  Pab1 is the polyA binding protein, and Pan3 is part of an alternative deadenylation
  complex (). (B) Factors noted in (A) were subjected to a 4-h depletion time course
  and cDTA-seq (as in Figure 4A). The matrix summarizes the Pearson correlation between
  the log-fold changes to transcripts relative to t = 0 in Xrn1 and Not1 depletion.
  Highlighted square corresponds to the scatterplot shown in (C). (C) Correlation
  between Xrn1 and Not1 depletion. Fold change relative to t = 0 after 90 min in Xrn1AID
  (x-axis) and Not1AID (y-axis). Changes are generally correlated. Set of Not1-sensitive
  transcripts are marked in blue, other points are colored by density. Data correspond
  to marked columns in (F) and marked square in (B). (D) Same as in (B), but comparing
  all time-course experiments. Highlighted square corresponds to the square depicted
  in (B). Note that the color scale is different. (E) Average changes to transcripts’
  mRNA relative to t = 0 (y-axis) along the time course (x-axis) for factors exhibiting
  significant correlation to Xrn1 (, see  for the 240’ timepoint). (F) mRNA changes
  upon interference to the 5′-3′ cytosolic pathway are correlated. Changes to transcripts
  (rows) along the time-course (x-axis, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240 min) in three
  time-courses: upon depletion of Xrn1, Dcp2, and Not1. The mRNA log fold change relative
  to t = 0 is color-coded. Transcripts are split into to Not1-sensitive (N = 672),
  and the rest of the transcripts (N = 4539). Rows in each set are sorted by the extreme
  point in a smoothed trajectory of the Xrn1 response. Highlighted columns correspond
  to the x- and the y-axis in (C). (G) The transcription adaptation response occurs
  earlier when the 5′-3′ pathway is perturbed upstream. Each line represents the average
  change (over all transcripts) to recently-transcribed mRNA relative to t = 0 (y-axis)
  along the depletion time course (x-axis) in each one of the four strains. The transcript-change
  distribution in each strain at the 60’ time point is detailed on the right, where
  the median of each distribution is denoted by a horizontal line. (H) Recently-transcribed
  mRNA differences explain total mRNA differences between strains. To compare the
  differences in response profiles between strains (in this case, comparing Xrn1 and
  Dcp2), we calculate the difference between the maximum observed change in mRNA per
  transcript (‘Δmax’, y-axis in scatter) and between cumulative nascent trajectories
  (shaded gray area in examples, ‘Δnew’, x-axis in scatter). We plot these statistics
  per transcript (dots in scatter, color denotes density) and found a significant
  correlation (Pearson r = 0.4 P < 10–170). See  for the same comparison between Dcp2
  and Not1 (Pearson r = 0.31, P < 10–98). (I) A unique cell-cycle signature when the
  5′-3′ degradation pathway is perturbed. We compared the distributions of transcription
  changes (relative to t = 0) in cell-cycle genes (rows) to the distributions of non-cycling
  genes (). Significant deviations are denoted as colored triangles (purple/down—lower
  than non-cycling genes, orange/up—higher than non-cycling genes, size proportional
  to Kolmogorov–Smirnov q-value). Each triangle denotes the difference in a specific
  depletion time point (columns, x-axis time since auxin addition, same as in (B)).
  The bottom panels denote the average log fold change to mRNA and nascent mRNA in
  the same samples (same as in E and G). For further details, data, and analysis see
  supplementary material.'
