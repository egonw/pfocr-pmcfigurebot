caption: The mechanism through which GART controls ERα intracellular levels in IDC
  breast cancer cells. (A) In vitro ERα competitive binding assays for lometrexol
  (LMX), and 17β-estradiol (E2) were performed at different doses of the compounds
  and using a florescent E2 as the tracer. Relative inhibitor concentration 50 (IC50,
  i.e., Kd) is given in the graph. The experiment was performed twice in quintuplicate.
  (B) Western blot and relative densitometric analysis of ERα levels in MCF-7 cells
  pre-treated with cycloheximide (CHX) at the indicated doses for 6 hours and then
  treated with lometrexol (LMX - 1 µM) for 48 hours. The loading control was done
  by evaluating vinculin expression in the same filter. Blots are representative images
  of three independent experiments. Significant differences with respect to the CHX
  samples are calculated by Student t-test and indicated by * (p < 0.05). (C) Western
  blot and relative densitometric analysis of ERα and GART levels in MCF-7 cells treated
  with GART siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 hours and then treated at the indicated
  time points with cycloheximide (CHX – 1 µg/ml). The loading control was done by
  evaluating vinculin expression in the same filter. siRNA effectiveness has been
  evaluated in the same samples with GART antibody. Blots are representative images
  of three independent experiments. Significant differences with respect to the CTR
  samples are calculated by Student t-test and indicated by * (p < 0.05). (D) Real-time
  qPCR analysis of ERα mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells, treated for 48 hours with lometrexol
  (LMX – 1 µM). The experiment was repeated twice in triplicate. (E) Western blotting
  analysis and (E’) relative densitometric analyses of LC3 and p62SQSTM cellular levels
  in MCF-7 cells treated lometrexol (LMX – 1 µM) for 48 hours. LC3 quantitation was
  performed using the formula LC3-II/(LC3-I+LC3-II). The loading control was done
  by evaluating tubulin expression in the same filter. Significant differences with
  respect to the CTR samples are calculated by Student t-test and indicated by * (p
  < 0.05) and **** (p < 0.0001).
