caption: 'NRF2-mediated autophagy dysfunction and ferroptosis are involved in foam
  cell formation induced by HUA. THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells were treated with oxLDL
  (100 μg/ml) or coincubated with UA (15 mg/dl) for 24 h. (a and b) qPCR was used
  to detect the transcription of lipid metabolism-related genes (CD36, ABCA1, and
  ABCG1) and ferroptosis-related genes (NFE2L2, SLC7A11, and GPX4) in macrophage-derived
  foam cells. (c and d) Representative western blot images of the protein level of
  the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway and autophagy-related proteins (LC3B and
  p62). (e and f) Quantification of NRF2, SLC7A11, GPX4, LC3B, and p62 protein levels.
  Data are means ± SD, n = 3. ABCA1: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; ABCG1: ATP-binding
  cassette transporter G1; HUA: high level of uric acid; oxLDL: oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein; qPCR: quantitative PCR. ns indicates no significance. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
