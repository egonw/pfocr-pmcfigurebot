caption: 'FANCE was involved in the regulation of multiple pathways in EC cells (A)
  Enrichment gene sets in HEC-1-A OE-FANCE cell as compared with HEC-1-A NC cell via
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Up-regulated pathways: DNA repair pathway (FDR=0.002,
  p=0.000), oxidative phosphorylation (FDR=0.007, p=0.000), p53 pathway (FDR=0.015,
  p=0.000) and THFα signaling via NFκB pathway (FDR=0.026, p=0.003). (B) Down-regulated
  pathways: KRAS signaling up pathway (FDR=0.042, p=0.001), mitotic spindle pathway
  (FDR=0.051, p=0.000), G2/M checkpoint (FDR=0.427, p=0.159) and E2F targets (FDR=0.830,
  p=0.726).'
