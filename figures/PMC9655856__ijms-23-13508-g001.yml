caption: Expressions of IQGAP2 in bladder cancer samples and cell lines. (A) The transcription
  level of IQGAP2 was significantly decreased in normal tissue compared to tumor tissue
  in different types of cancers, including bladder cancer (Oncomine database). (B)
  The expression levels of IQGAP2 in TCGA tumor tissues and their corresponding normal
  tissues showed reduced expressions in bladder cancer (Timer). (C) The expressions
  of IQGAP2 in cancer cell lines derived from the urinary tract were low compared
  to other tumor entities (CCLE) (* p < 0.05). (D) The mRNA levels of IQGAP2 in bladder
  cancer cell lines were decreased compared to urothelial cell line SV-HUC-1. Bar
  chart presents the means of replicates ± SEM from three different experiments; *
  p  ≤  0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p ≤ 0.001; Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired)
  was used for comparison of means. (E) The protein levels of IQGAP2 were also decreased
  in bladder cancer cell lines compared to the urothelial cell line SV-HUC-1 and was
  lost in T24.
