caption: 'Fatty acids production from glucose in engineered O. polymorpha. A Schematic
  diagram of FFA synthesis pathway and leucine (LEU) metabolism in O. polymorpha.
  Deletion of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by FAA1) may block the β-oxidation
  of FFA, which eventually result in FFA accumulation. α-IPM: α-isopropyl malic acid,
  β-IPM: β-isopropyl malic acid, α-KIC: α-Ketoisocaproic acid, HMG-CoA: Hydroxymeglutaryl-CoA.
  B Cell growth of O. polymorpha strains with integrated OpLEU2 in situ and disrupted
  FAA1. C FFA titers of O. polymorpha strains with integrated OpLEU2 in situ and disrupted
  FAA1. The fermentation was carried out in minimal medium containing 20 g/L glucose
  at 37 °C 220 rpm for 96 h. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biologically
  independent samples). Red asterisks indicate statistical significance as determined
  by paired t test (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001)'
