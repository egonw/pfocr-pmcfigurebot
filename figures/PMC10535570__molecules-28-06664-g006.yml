caption: Three possible biosynthetic pathways (A–C) towards javaniside-like structures.
  Typically, the Pictet–Spengler reaction is accomplished by a pictet–spenglerase,
  which leads to the formation of various monoterpene indole alkaloids []. In pathway
  A, however, the Pictet–Spengler reaction occurs via a spiroindolenine transition
  state that is followed by the oxidation of the imine instead of the necessary group
  migration to form strictosidine []. In pathway B, the tryptamine is first oxidized
  to 2-oxotryptamine prior the enamine formation and ring closure. The intermediate
  from both pathways can then be further transformed to javanisides by saponification
  and subsequent lactam-ring formation. Cong et al. postulated a similar pathway towards
  mappiodosides D and E, starting from tryptophan instead of tryptamine and following
  pathway A []. A recently reported alternative pathway C would originate from strictosidine
  or strictosamide. Here, a monoxigenase-catalyzed oxidation followed by a (semi-)pinacol
  rearrangement (only semipinacol depicted) would lead to the spiro-indole motif.
  The formation of the lactam present in javanisides may happen before or after this
  step [].
