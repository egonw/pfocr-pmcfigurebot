caption: 'OG suppresses bone resorption in SAMP6 mice and osteoclast derived from
  RAW264.7 cells. (a) Representative Western blot analysis and the quantification
  of NFATc1, c-FOS, CTSK, and MMP9 expression in bone tissue of SAMP6 mice. (b) Osteoclasts
  were labeled with phalloidin (F-actin ring) and DAPI (nuclei). Scale bars: 20 μm.
  (c, d) The content of Ca2+ and CTX-1 in the coculture medium of osteoclast and bone
  slices. (e) Representative Western blot analysis and the quantification of NFATc1,
  c-FOS, CTSK, and MMP9 expression in osteoclast. Images presented are representative
  of ≥3 sections for each group or independent experiments, and each point represents
  mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the indicated group.'
