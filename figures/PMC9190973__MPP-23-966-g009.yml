caption: Chemical synthesis and localization of fluorescein‐medicarpin at powdery
  mildew (PM) infection‐sites in R108 leaves. (a) Schematic for the chemical synthesis
  of 2MF (4), 2HF (5), medicarpin (6), and fluorescein‐medicarpin (8), and excitation/emission
  fluorescence spectra of fluorescein‐medicarpin. AlCl3, aluminium chloride; ACN,
  acetonitrile; BF3.OEt2, boron trifluoride etherate; MeSO2Cl, methanesulfonyl chloride;
  DMF, dimethylformamide; RT, room temperature. (b) Representative images showing
  localization of fluorescein‐medicarpin or fluorescein (mock) 3 h after medicarpin
  treatment (preinoculation) and at 24 h postinoculation (hpi) after Erysiphe pisi
  inoculation. Fluorescein‐medicarpin is visible as green fluorescence (arrows) beneath
  the appressorium (middle panel) and in the primary haustorial complex (HC; bottom
  panel). c, conidium; a, appressorium, h, hypha. PI, propidium iodide; DAPI, 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole;
  Scale bar, 20 µm. (c) Percentage of E. pisi conidia showing PM infection site‐localized
  fluorescence in medicarpin‐ and mock‐treated leaves. A total of 50 infection sites
  were assessed from five leaflets/treatment
