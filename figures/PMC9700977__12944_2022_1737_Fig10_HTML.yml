caption: Therapeutic exercise could alter target metabolites in patients with cNLBP. A Comparison
  of the volumes of uridine 5’-monophosphate, thymidine, 2’-deoxyadenosine, 5’-deoxyadenosine,
  N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, stachydrine, inosine, gallic acid, and γ-aminobutyric
  acid in patients treated with therapeutic exercise for two weeks or without therapeutic
  treatment. Different letters show a significant difference from nontreated patients
  using Student’s t test (P < 0.05). B Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that pyrimidine
  metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, and galactose metabolism were enriched in patients
  treated with therapeutic exercise (P value cutoff ≤ 0.05)
