caption: Circ‐EIF3I interacted with miR‐1253. (a) The binding sites between circ‐EIF3I
  and miR‐1253 were shown. (b), (c) Dual‐luciferase reporter assay was performed to
  assess the interaction between circ‐EIF3I and miR‐1253. (d) The expression of miR‐1253
  in 36 paired LC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was measured by qRT‐PCR.
  (e) Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between circ‐EIF3I
  and miR‐1253 in LC tumor tissues. (f) qRT‐PCR was used to test miR‐1253 expression
  in HBE cells and LC cells (A549 and H1299). (g) Circ‐EIF3I expression was determined
  by qRT‐PCR in A549 and H1299 cells transfected with vector or circ‐EIF3I overexpression
  vector. (h) A549 and H1299 cells were transfected with si‐NC, si‐circ‐EIF3I, vector
  or circ‐EIF3I. The expression of miR‐1253 was examined by qRT‐PCR. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001. LC, lung cancer; qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain
  reaction; HBE, human bronchial epithelial cell line
