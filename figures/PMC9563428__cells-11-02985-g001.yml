caption: Schematic summary of the connection between different environmental conditions
  and SA-dependent immunity. Plant growth depends on multiple environmental factors,
  including temperature, atmospheric CO2, and soil quality (nutrient status). These
  factors have also been found to modulate SA level and SA-dependent defense response
  against various pathogens. Notably, an NPR1-independent pathway exists in external
  factor-mediated protection, which potentially bypasses SA and the associated negative
  effect on plant growth. SA, salicylic acid; JA, jasmonic acid; NPR1, nonexpressor
  of pathoegenesis-related genes 1; PR, pathogenesis-related; Pip, pipecolic acid;
  NHP, N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid; SAR, systemic acquired resistance; eCO2, elevated
  CO2; P, phosphorus; N, nitrogen; PHR1, phosphate starvation response 1.
