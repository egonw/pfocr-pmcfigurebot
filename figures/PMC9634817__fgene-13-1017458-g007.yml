caption: 'An illustration of genes involved in thermogenesis in cold-exposed Altay
  and Hu lambs. (A): In cold-exposed Altay lambs, PPAR and calcium ion signaling pathway
  in muscle tissue were activated and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), such
  as APOC3, FABP4, LPL, PCK1, PLIN1, CABP, and CALN1 were up-regulated. (B): In cold-exposed
  Hu lambs, cAMP signaling pathway was activated in muscle tissue and ADCY10, and
  ADORA2A were down-regulated. And the gene expression of PVALB, TNNC1, MYL2, and
  ACTC1 related to muscle contraction were higher in the muscle tissue of Altay than
  in Hu lambs.'
