caption: 'Effects of AMPK/ERK on foam cell formation, inflammation and ferroptosis
  in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. GAPDH was used as a control for the standardization
  of the total cellular protein. (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the
  expression of cholesterol transport protein following application of the indicated
  treatments. (B) Quantitative analysis of SRA, CD36, AEBP1, SR-B1 and ABCG1 levels.
  (C) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression levels of the inflammatory
  indices following application of the indicated treatments. (D) Quantitative analysis
  of caspase-1, IL-1β and NLRP3 levels. (E) Western blot analysis was used to measure
  the levels of ferroptosis indices following the indicated treatments. (F) Quantitative
  analysis of Gpx4 and Hmox-1 levels. (G) Determination of the SOD and MDA levels
  in macrophages. *P<0.05 vs. the PMA group, **P<0.01 vs. the PMA group and ^P<0.05,
  ^^P<0.01 vs. the ox-LDL group, #P<0.05 vs. the ox-LDL group, ##P<0.01 vs. the ox-LDL
  group. AMPK, 5'' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ox-LDL, oxidized
  low-density lipoprotein; SRA, scavenger receptor A; CD36, cluster of differentiation
  36; AEBP1, adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1; SR-B1, scavenger receptor B1; ABCG1,
  ATP binding cassette transporter G1; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor protein 3; GPX4, glutathione
  peroxidase 4; Hmox-1; heme oxygenase-1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
