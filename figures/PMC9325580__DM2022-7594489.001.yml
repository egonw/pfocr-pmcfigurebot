caption: COPS3 was highly expressed in COAD tissues and cell lines. (a) TCGA database
  showed the levels of transcript per million (TPM) in 286 tumor tissues compared
  to the 41 normal tissues. (b) qPCR assays showed the mRNA levels of COPS3 in normal
  cell line NCM460 and 4 COAD cell lines, including SW480, HCT116, LoVo, and DLD-1.
  (c and d) Immunoblot assays showed the protein levels of COPS3 in normal cell line
  NCM460 and 4 COAD cell lines, including SW480, HCT116, LoVo, and DLD-1. Data are
  presented as mean ± SD. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
