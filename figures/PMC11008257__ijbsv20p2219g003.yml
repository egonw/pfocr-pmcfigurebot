caption: The expression level of NUP85 is raised after FFA treatment in AML-12 cells.
  A. The expression level of NUP85 protein with different FFA concentrations was detected
  by Western blotting. B. The expression level of NUP85 protein after 2 mm FFA treatment
  for 24 h was detected by Western blotting. C-E. NUP85 expression levels were detected
  by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and RT-qPCR. F-G. RT-qPCR and Western blotting
  were used to examine the expression level of NUP85 after transfected with NUP85-siRNA.
  H-I. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to examine the level of NUP85 after
  transfected with pcDNA3.1-3×Flag-c-NUP85. J. Immunofluorescence analysis was used
  to examine the level of NUP85 after transfected with pcDNA3.1-3×Flag-c-NUP85 and
  NUP85-siRNA. Measurement metrics are shown in the figure. All experimental results
  of this study were replicated at least three times. * *p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared
  with the pair group.
