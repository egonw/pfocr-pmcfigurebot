figure_title: Effect of ROC administration on JNK signaling pathway in the dorsal
  skin in UVA-B-irradiated Skh:HR-2 mice. ROC was administered via oral gavage for
  13 weeks. After 3-week ROC administration, mice were exposed to UVA-B irradiation
  3 times per week for ten weeks. (A) Total lysates of dorsal skin tissues were prepared
  and analyzed using Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Images of Western
  blots representative of 3 independent experiments are displayed. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of Western blot results. The protein abundance was normalized to β-actin
  and expressed relative to that of the NOR group. (C) Nuclear protein from dorsal
  skin tissues was extracted, and the AP-1 content in the nuclear protein was measured.
  Each bar represents the mean ± SEM (n = 10)
