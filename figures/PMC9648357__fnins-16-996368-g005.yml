caption: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). FDR < 0.25 and p.adjust < 0.05 were
  considered to be significant. (A) Neutrophil degranulation, (B) leukocyte transendothelial
  migration, (C) disease of the immune system, (D) cytokines and inflammatory response,
  (E) inflammatory response pathway, (F) IL18 signaling pathway, (G) TNF alpha signaling
  pathway, and (H) senescence and autophagy in cancer were involved in the pathological
  process of TLE. The GSEA results showed that immune- and inflammation-related pathways
  were significantly associated with TLE development.
