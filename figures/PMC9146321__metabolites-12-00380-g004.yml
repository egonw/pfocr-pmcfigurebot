caption: 'Metabolome view of the pathway impact analysis obtained from significantly
  changed metabolites in stool from Cef treatments in KO (A) and differential metabolites
  in WT mice (B). This analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca,
  accessed on 1 January 2022). The color and size of each circle is based on p-values
  (yellow: higher p-values, and red: lower p-values) and pathway impact values (the
  larger the circle, the higher the impact score) calculated from the topological
  analysis, respectively. The pathways were considered as significantly impacted if
  p < 0.05, the impact is 0.1, and the number of metabolite hits in the pathway >
  1.'
