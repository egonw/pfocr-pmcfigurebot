figure_title: Individual transcriptomes quantify caste canalization and its regulation
  by the JH signalling pathway
caption: a, Developmental potential scores (−1 < Δ<1) reflecting caste commitment
  for gyne (positive score) and worker (negative score) phenotypes across developmental
  stages of M. pharaonis as body length increases, corresponding to the representative
  images towards the right (courtesy L.P.). Δ values are based on normalized difference
  of transcriptomic distances between target individuals and an average gyne (calculated
  as the mean transcriptome across gynes within the same stage) and an average worker
  in the subsequent stage. A positive Δ value means that transcriptomic distance between
  a target individual and the average gyne in the next stage is less than between
  the target individual and the average worker in the next stage, so the target individual
  has a gyne-biased developmental potential. Caste identities were known from morphological
  characters, except for first instar larvae where they were inferred via BPA. b,
  Caste- and body length-specific expression of JH and ecdysone (20E) pathways, coloured
  according to gyne-biased (red) or worker-biased (blue) expression in third instar
  larvae (upper panel). The expression of jhamt and E93 showed both caste-specific
  (qualitative) and body size-specific (quantitative) thresholds (vertical dashed
  lines; estimated with a threshold regression model ()) (lower panel). Note that
  the downregulation of jhamt (terminating the JH biosynthesis) preceded the upregulation
  of E93 to actively initiate metamorphosis (see Extended Data Fig.  for expression
  patterns of other genes in this pathway). c, In third instar larvae of intermediate
  body length, feeding with JHA increased worker pupal body length (two-sided t-test;
  P = 0.0004; d.f. = 16.38; t = 4.44; n = 16 for both control and treatment groups),
  while precocene I decreased gyne pupal body length (two-sided t-test; P = 0.0001;
  d.f. = 50.70; t = −4.13; n = 30 and 28 for control and treatment groups, respectively).
  The box plot shows the median (centre line), 25% and 75% quartiles (boxes), outermost
  values (whiskers) and data points (jitter plot overlapping with boxes and whiskers).
