caption: GCN2 amino acid stress signaling genetic reporters.A, pathway immunoblotting
  analysis of the mammalian GCN2-ISR. 3T3 WT and GCN2-deficient (Eif2ak4−/−) cells
  were starved in Leu-deficient media (Leu starvation) for the times indicated (h).
  Lysates were probed for activation of GCN2 (p-GCN2 T898), total GCN2, ATF4 as a
  marker of the ISR. GRB2 was used as a loading control. B, kinetics and GCN2 dependency
  of CHOP expression in response to leucine starvation. Data are representative of
  a minimum of three independent experiments. C, schematic representation of the Ddit3
  locus (encoding CHOP) with the position of the sgRNAs (guides). Homologous repair
  plasmids are indicated. D, representative live-cell imaging showing the mCherry
  signal following Leu starvation and the dependence on GCN2. sgRNA, single-guide
  RNA.
