figure_title: Heatmap comparison of cell wall, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)/glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, redox, nucleotides and amino acid metabolites in JE2, pgl and pglcomp
caption: Whole cell metabolomics was performed on JE2, pgl and pglcomp grown in CDMG
  and CDMG OX 10 μg/ml. Data presented are the average of three biological replicates
  (2 biological replicates for FAD) analysed using GraphPad Prism V9. Individual metabolite
  levels that were significantly different using a one-way ANOVA with Turkey’s post-hoc
  in pgl grown in CDMG, CDMG OX or both are highlighted in bold text. * significant
  difference in either CDMG or CDMG OX. ** significant difference in both CDMG and
  CDMG OX.
