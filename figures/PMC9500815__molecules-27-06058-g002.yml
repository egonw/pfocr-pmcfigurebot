caption: 'Effects of different treatments on levels of serum cytokines TNF-α (A),
  IL-1β (B), PGE2 (C), and on levels of signaling pathway proteins RANKL (D), OPG
  (E) and RANKL/OPG (F) in arthritic rats (x ± SD). Error bars represent standard
  deviations (n = 6). As compared with the control group, # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01
  indicate that serum cytokine levels of the untreated arthritis model (AA) group
  were significantly different from corresponding control group levels. As compared
  with the untreated arthritis model (AA) group: * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 indicated
  significant reduction in serum cytokine levels in the treated arthritis model group.'
