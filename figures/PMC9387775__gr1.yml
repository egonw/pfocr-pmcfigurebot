caption: A pan-cancer proteomic map of 949 human cancer cell lines(A) Methodology
  overview for pan-cancer characterization of 949 human cell lines using a DIA-MS
  workflow.(B) Proteomic measurements were integrated with independent molecular and
  phenotypic datasets spanning 1,303 cancer cell lines as part of the Cell Model Passports
  Database. Data include proteomics (ProCan-DepMapSanger) presented here, transcriptomics,
  drug response (Sanger), mutation, copy number, methylation, drug response (CTD2),
  CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality (Broad&Sanger), drug response (PRISM), and proteomics
  (CCLE). Each gray slice denotes a unique cell line, and the total number of cell
  lines per dataset is indicated. The proteomic data (ProCan-DepMapSanger) generated
  in this study are shown in orange, as well as the expanded drug response (Sanger)
  dataset.(C) Number of drugs included in the drug response (Sanger) screen, with
  the orange bar highlighting the additional number of unique drugs presented in this
  study compared to previous studies. Drugs are grouped by the pathway of their canonical
  targets.(D) Pearson’s correlations of the proteomes for each set of six technical
  replicates, as well as each cancer type, tissue type, batch and instrument. Random
  indicates the correlation between random unmatched sets of replicates. Median Pearson’s
  r for each group is reported. Box-and-whisker plots indicate interquartile range
  (IQR) with a line at the median. Whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values
  at 1.5 × IQRs.See also ,  and .
