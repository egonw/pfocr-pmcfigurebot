caption: Exploration of potential mechanism of the 14-lncRNA prognostic model. (A)
  Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes between high-risk and low-risk groups
  in the TCGA-PAAD cohort. Red dot represents up-regulated genes, blue dot represents
  down-regulated genes, and grey dot represents not differentially expressed genes.
  (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. (C) Comparison
  of immune score between high-risk and low-risk groups in the TCGA-PAAD cohort. (D)
  Immune status analysis of 28 types of immune cells between high-risk and low-risk
  groups in the TCGA-PAAD cohort
