caption: Proposed model for HG-induced, CARD9-mediated metabolic dysregulation of
  the islet beta cell. Based on the data accrued from our recent [] and current investigation,
  we propose that HG (metabolic stress) conditions promote activation of a signaling
  pathway involving CARD9. Exposure of pancreatic beta cells to HG promotes dissociation
  of RhoGDIβ-Rac1 complex, via increased association between RhoGDIβ and CARD9. This,
  in turn, leads to the activation of Rac1, and associated downstream signaling steps
  including activation of oxidative (Nox2-mediated) and ER stress, and activation
  of stress kinases (p38MAPK). Data accrued from the current investigation demonstrate
  that Rac1 activation step is necessary for S536 phosphorylation of p65 (RelA), and
  potential translocation of p65-STAT3 complex to the nuclear fraction under these
  conditions. Additional studies are needed to further assess roles of this signaling
  pathway and identification of other regulatory proteins/factors that require signaling
  steps (e.g., protein prenylation) that are necessary for HG-induced p65 phosphorylation,
  as demonstrated in the current study.
