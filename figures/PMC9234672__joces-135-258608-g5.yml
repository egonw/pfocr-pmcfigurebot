caption: 'SUFU and SMO expression and activity in developing CGNPs. (A,B) Confocal
  images showing (A) SUFU and (B) Smoothened (SMO) protein expression in the E15.5
  RL, E15.5 EGL, P0 and P7 cerebellum. Counterstaining by DAPI (RL, rhombic lip; EGL,
  external granular layer; IGL, internal granular layer; E, embryonic day; P, postnatal
  day). Insets showing higher magnification (4×). Scale bars: 25 µm. See also Fig. S3A.
  (C) Confocal images showing representative examples of Arl13b and tdTomato protein
  expression in E15.5 (upper panel) and P7 (lower panel) primary CGNP cultures. Counterstaining
  by DAPI. Scale bar: 10 µm. Images in A–C are representative of n=3 experimental
  repeats. (D,E) Box-and-whisker plots showing primary cilium ratio (D) and length
  (E) in cultured E15.5 and P7 CGNPs. n=4 biological replicates. **P<0.01 (unpaired,
  two-sided t-tests). (F) Plots showing the average ratio of PCNA+/DAPI+ E15 and P7
  cerebellar cells after SmoM2 (left chart) or Sufu-i shRNA (right chart), or empty
  vector (EV) control retroviral transduction. Results represent median and complete
  range; n=3 biological replicates, except for P7 EV (SmoM2), which was n=2. *P<0.05
  (for SmoM2, unpaired, two-sided t-test; for Sufu-i, paired, two-sided t-test). See
  also Fig. S3B,C. For the box-and-whisker plots, the box represents the 25–75th percentiles,
  and the median is indicated. The whiskers show the minimum to maximum.'
