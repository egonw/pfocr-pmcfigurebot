caption: Shh signaling pathway regulates RA-FLS migration via Rho/ROCK pathway, tested
  with Transwell assays. RA-FLS were treated with purmorphamine, purmorphamine combined
  with Y27632, Y27632, or cyclopamine and the cell migration potency was evaluated
  with Transwell assays. (a) The photos of migrated RA-FLS were observed under an
  inverted microscope at 100x magnification. (b) The numbers of migrated RA-FLS were
  calculated under the microscope and displayed with a histogramat. ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
