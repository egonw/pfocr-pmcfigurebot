caption: LOXL promotes the expression of Amps via activation of Dorsal signaling pathway.
  (A) Efficiency of LoxL-RNAi in hemocytes and intestines, detected using qPCR; dsGfp
  injection was used as the control. (B,C) Detection of mRNA levels of Dorsal, Relish,
  and STAT in hemocytes (B) and intestines (C) of LoxL-RNAi shrimp via qPCR at 24
  hpi of WSSV injection; dsGfp injection was used as the control. (D,E) The expression
  of different Amps hemocytes (D) and intestines (E) of LoxL-knockdown shrimp; dsGfp
  injection was used as the control. Expression of β-actin and Ef1-α served as internal
  reference genes and were processed using geometric means. The values of mRNA relative
  expression levels were expressed as mean ± SD, and that of the control shrimp was
  set as 1. Error bars in the figure represent SDs of three replicates.
