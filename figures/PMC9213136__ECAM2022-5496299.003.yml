caption: GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment of CV-3 candidate targets against
  AF. (a) Analysis of target GO terms in biological processes, (b) cellular components,
  and (c) molecular functions. (d) Circle of candidate targets by KEGG pathway enrichment.
  Percentage of gene count enriched in the GO term of the 8 key targets, gene ratio
  magnitude is represented in green and red. The gene count is indicated using the
  circle size meaning the number of genes enriched in the GO term. The outermost circle
  on the right represents names of signaling pathways, and genes are on the left.
  The left inner circle represents the significance of p values of genes corresponding
  to pathways.
