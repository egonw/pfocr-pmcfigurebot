caption: Pygo2 knockdown ameliorated mesenteric adipocyte poor differentiation in
  Il‐10 −/−  mice. Il‐10 −/− mice were treated and divided into four groups as shown
  in Figure  (both n = 8). Immunohistochemical staining of the adipocyte maturation
  marker perilipin in MAT (A). Quantitative analysis of perilipin expression in MAT
  (B). Relative adipocyte size (C). Western blot and relative protein intensities
  of PPARγ and C/EBPα (D). Western blot and relative protein intensities of ATGL and
  LPL (E). The relative protein intensity was evaluated by ImageJ software, and the
  IOD values of the target protein were normalized to β‐actin. PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator‐activated
  receptor γ; C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha; ATGL, adipose
  triglyceride lipase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; IOD, integrated optical density; WT,
  wild‐type; OE, overexpression; KD, knockdown. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
