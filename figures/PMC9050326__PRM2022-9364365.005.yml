  the JAK3/STAT5 pathway in vitro. (a) The Western blot assay images for the levels
  of JAK3, pSTAT5, and STAT5 in T cells. (b) The protein level of JAK3 in T cells
  measured by Western blot assay. (c) The protein level of pSTAT5/STAT5 in T cells
  measured by Western blot assay. ∗P < 0.05 vs. the control (PBS) group. #P < 0.05
