caption: Metabolite set enrichment analysis of differential serum metabolites between
  the wooden breast (WB) myopathy-affected and unaffected control (CON) broiler chickens
  revealed by bubble plot. Each dot represents a metabolic pathway, the size of the
  dot represents the number of metabolites, and the color indicates the degree of
  statistical significance.
