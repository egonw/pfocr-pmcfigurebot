caption: ROCK1 promotes LSCC tumorigenesis and progression via the FAK pathway. A The
  expression levels of p-FAK and FAK in TU686/si-ROCK1, TU212/si-ROCK1, TU686/si-nc
  and TU212/si-nc cells were examined by Western Blot. B The expression levels of
  p-FAK and FAK in TU686/ROCK1, TU212/ROCK1, TU686/vector and TU212/vector cells were
  examined by Western Blot. C The expression levels of ROCK1, p-FAK and FAK in TU686/ROCK1/parental,
  TU686/ROCK1/DMSO, TU212/ROCK1/parental, TU212/ROCK1/DMSO, TU686/ROCK1/TAE226 and
  TU212/ROCK1/TAE226 cells were examined by Western Blot. D–G Inhibiting FAK activity
  reduced TU686 and TU212 cell migration and invasion (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01)
