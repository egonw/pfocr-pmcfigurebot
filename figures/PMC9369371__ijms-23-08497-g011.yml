caption: Analysis of interactions between lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in the cerebral
  cortex and hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. (a) Number of core lncRNAs in the cortex and
  hippocampus obtained by RNA-seq analysis. (b) Number of common miRNAs between core
  lncRNA-predicted miRNAs and miRNAs identified in both areas by RNA-seq analysis.
  (c) Establishment of the lncRNA-miRNA regulatory network in the cortex and hippocampus
  of 5×FAD mice based on the seven core lncRNAs and 771 miRNA targets. The V-shaped
  nodes represent the core lncRNAs, while red-orange and green nodes represent upregulated
  and downregulated lncRNAs. The octagonal and blue nodes represent lncRNA-targeted
  miRNAs, respectively. (d) Venn diagram indicating the number of common mRNAs between
  the core miRNA-predicted mRNAs and mRNAs from the RNA-seq results. GO annotation
  of the top 10 BPs (e), CCs (f), and MFs (g) related to the common mRNAs. The bubble
  size represents the number of targets enriched in each entry, while the color represents
  the enrichment significance based on the corrected p-value. (h) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of core lncRNA-associated mRNAs. Each line represents one gene, and a line
  connecting two pathways indicates that this gene is enriched in both pathways. The
  wider the connecting line, the greater the number of shared genes. Different pathways
  are presented in different colors.
