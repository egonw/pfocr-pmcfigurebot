caption: Modulatory effects of HPL-MSCs on the phenotype of macrophages at the gene
  level. (A) Transcription levels of (Aa) iNOS, (Ab) TNF-α, (Ac) IL-6 and (Ad) IL-1β
  in macrophages after co-culture with HPL-MSCs, as revealed by RT-qPCR. (B) RT-qPCR
  analysis of IL-10 transcription levels in macrophages after co-culture with HPL-MSCs.
  The experiments were representative of at least three independent trials, each with
  three technical replicates. The error bars represent the standard deviations. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. HPL-MSC, human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
