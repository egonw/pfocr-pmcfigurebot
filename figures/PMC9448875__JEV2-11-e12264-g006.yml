caption: 'CRC‐EVs activate NOD1 signalling to induce inflammatory responses in macrophages.
  (a) Relative levels of p‐RIP2, p‐p65 and p‐p38 versus β‐actin. C12‐iE‐DAP represents
  the positive control; (n = 3). (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for differentially
  expressed genes (|log2FC| ≥ 1, p‐value < 0.05). (c and d) Relative IL‐6 and TNF‐α
  mRNA levels. C12‐iE‐DAP represents the positive control; (n = 3). (e and f) THP‐1
  cells were pre‐treated with ML130 (20 μM) for 1 h and then treated with EV‐HT29
  or EV‐MC38. (e) Relative levels of p‐RIP2, p‐p65 and p‐p38 versus β‐actin after
  30 min incubation ;(n = 3). (f) Relative IL‐6 mRNA expression levels after 90 min
  incubation ; (n = 3). (g and h) WT‐BMDMs and NOD1–/–‐BMDMs were treated with EV‐HT29
  or EV‐MC38. (g) Relative levels of p‐RIP2, p‐p65 and p‐p38 versus β‐actin after
  30 min incubation; (n = 3). (h) Relative IL‐6 mRNA expression levels after 90 min
  incubation; (n = 3). NC: negative control; obtained from DMEM with 5% ‘EV‐depleted
  FBS’ with differential ultracentrifugation and 0.22‐μm filtration. Data are presented
  as the mean ± S.D. (error bars) of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001. Student''s t‐test was used to determine the significance level'
