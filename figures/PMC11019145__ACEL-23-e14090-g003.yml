caption: Metabolic architecture of multi‐domain aging. (a) Shows overlap in metabolites
  associated with each aging‐related domain in Health ABC (in age, sex, race‐adjusted
  regression). The bar graph to the left of the aging domains specifies the total
  number of metabolite associations (at a 5% false discovery rate). We did not observe
  any significant metabolite associations with psychosocial stress (not shown). (b)
  Displays the age, race, and sex‐adjusted regression estimates for top 20 metabolites
  (by magnitude) in association with aging phenotypes across aging domains in Health
  ABC (phenotypes in columns; metabolites in rows). Positive coefficients indicated
  a greater metabolite level was associated with a prognostically better value of
  the phenotype. (c) Represents results of pathway analysis (as described in Section ).
  Two phenotypes (CLOX1 score, Psychosocial risk index) did not have any metabolites
  significant at 5% false discovery rate and are not listed. Grey box indicates there
  was no gene implicated in the given pathway by the metabolomic associations.
