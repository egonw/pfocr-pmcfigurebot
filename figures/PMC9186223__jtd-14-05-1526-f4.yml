caption: 'The inhibition of the β-catenin pathway attenuates the migration ability
  of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to promote atrial fibroblasts (Crystal violet staining);
  migration counts, and statistical analysis of the atrial fibroblasts in each group.
  *P<0.05, compared to the control group; #P<0.05, compared to the TMAO + ICG-001
  group.'
article_title: The transformation of atrial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is promoted
  by trimethylamine N-oxide via the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway.
