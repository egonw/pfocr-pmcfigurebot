caption: 'Effect of piperine pretreatment on seizure severity and extracellular glutamate
  levels in rats with KA. (A) Seizure scores are recorded every 30 min (n = 9). *
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 versus the KA group. (B) The extracellular
  glutamate levels from the cisterna magna were evaluated by HPLC (n = 5). Data are
  presented as the means ± S.E.M. # p < 0.001 versus the KA group; *** p < 0.001 versus
  the control group (ANOVA/Scheffé).'
