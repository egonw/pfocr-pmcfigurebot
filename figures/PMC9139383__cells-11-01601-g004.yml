caption: 'Scrib1 mutation modulating ERK protein levels in the hippocampus and having
  a biphasic effect on the ERK signaling pathway. (A) Representative immunoblot illustration
  of CA1, CA3, and DG from control and social WT and Scribcrc/+ mice analyzed simultaneously
  for phospho−ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and ERK1/2. (B,C) Quantifications of phospho−ERK1 and
  phospho−ERK2 in CA1, CA3, and DG (2-way ANOVA; social WT vs. social Scribcrc/+;
  pERK1/ERK1−CA3: F1,12 = 6.41, * p < 0.05; social pERK2/ERK2−DG: F1,16 = 8.96, **
  p < 0.01; pERK2/ERK2−CA3: F1,15 = 9.88, ** p < 0.01 for genotype x exposure interaction;
  n = 5–8 values per conditions). (D) Luciferase reporter assay data from HEK293 cells
  transfected with the SRE-LUC reporter vector, along with the increasing amount of
  the Scrib or Scribcrc/+ expression plasmid as indicated (2−way ANOVA: F11.132 =
  217.4; *** p < 0.0001 for dose effect). Activation threshold of the serum-induced
  ERK pathway is indicated by the horizontal dashed line (Scrib vs. Scribcrc, Bonferroni
  comparison t-test: 25 ng: t16 = 13.68, *** p < 0.001; 50 ng: t16 = 9.248, *** p
  < 0.001; 100 ng: t34 = 8.57, *** p < 0.001; 250 ng: t16 = 3.31, * p < 0.05; 500
  ng: t16 = 3.31, n.s; n = 9 values per condition). All data are presented as median
  with 25th and 75th percentiles, and single data points are shown as dots. The shaded
  area represents the probability distribution of the variable.'
