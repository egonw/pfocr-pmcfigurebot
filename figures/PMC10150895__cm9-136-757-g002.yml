caption: 'Possible molecular mechanisms of JPX in human cancers. (A) JPX regulated
  miR-33a-5p/Twist1-mediated EMT progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  in LC. (B) JPX functioned as a ceRNA for miR-145-5p to regulate cyclin D2 (CCND2)
  expression, and then promoted cell cycle progression in NSCLC. (C) JPX regulated
  NSCLC EMT by modulating miR-5195-3p/VEGFA axis. (D) JPX promoted CC progression
  by modulating miR-25-3p/SOX4 axis. (E) JPX was overexpressed in OSCC and promoted
  malignancy via miR-944/cadherin 2 (CDH2) axis. (F) JPX promoted GC progression by
  regulating C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) and autophagy via inhibiting
  miR-197. (G) JPX contributed to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways via miRNAs/transforming
  growth factor β receptor (TGF-βR) axis, thus enhancing polyploidization and terminal
  maturation of megakaryocytes. (H) Anticancer effects of melatonin via regulating
  JPX/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human OS cells. (I) JPX promoted the progression
  of ovarian cancer through PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway. CC: Cervical cancer; ceRNA: Competing endogenous RNA; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; GC: Gastric cancer; LC: Lung cancer; LncRNA: Long noncoding RNA; miR:
  MircoRNA; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; OS: Osteosarcoma; OSCC: Oral squamous
  cell carcinoma; P: Phosphorylation; VEGFA: Vascular endothelial growth factor A.'
