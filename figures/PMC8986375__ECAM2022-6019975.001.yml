caption: Microarray expression profile analysis of lncRNA in paclitaxel-resistant
  TNBC cells. (a) Comparison of the growth rate between the parental cells (MDA-MB-231P)
  and the paclitaxel-resistant cells (MDA-MB-231R). (b) MTT assay showing the comparison
  of the cell viability between MDA-MB-231P and MDA-MB-231R after treatment with different
  concentration of paclitaxel, indicating the paclitaxel sensitivity of MDA-MB-231R
  cells. ∗∗P < 0.01 versus MDA-MB-231P. n = 5. (c) Comparison of the lncRNA expression
  levels between MDA-MB-231R and MDA-MB-231P. Log2 scale was used in X- and Y-axis.
  (d) Gene Ontology analysis showing the predicted target genes of differentially
  expressed lncRNAs. (e) Pathway analysis showing the predicted target genes of differentially
  expressed lncRNAs.
