caption: 'PGB performed neuroprotective effects during RIR injury. (A) A mouse RIR
  model was successfully established. Microscopic examination showed that the fundus
  of normal mice had clear optic disc boundaries and well-filled blood vessels; however,
  in the ischemic group of mice, which showed a sharp increase in IOP, the retinal
  optic disc boundaries were unclear, blood vessels were cut off, and the retina appeared
  pale. (B) The mice were pretreated with PGB before modeling, and the neuroprotective
  effect was evaluated at 24 hours and 7 days after RIR. (C) Representative H&E images
  of retinal sections (40×). Scale bars: 50 µm. (D) Representative OCT scans in living
  mice. Scale bars: 200 µm. (E) Representative retinal mounts with fluorescent staining
  of RGCs (20×). Scale bars: 100 µm. (F–H) Thickness of the whole retina (F) and RNFL
  and GCC (G) and the number of RGCs (H) decreased under RIR insult, whereas PGB pretreatment
  rescued the deterioration of the above indicators. The most significant improvement
  was observed at the dose of 30 mg/kg (n = 6). *P  < 0.05 versus control group; **P
  < 0.05 versus NaCl + RIR group; ***P < 0.05 versus 30-mg/kg PGB + RIR group.'
