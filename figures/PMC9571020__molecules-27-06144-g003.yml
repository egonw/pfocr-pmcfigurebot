caption: HSC lacks a chromophore, making chromatographic fractions hard to assay.
  (A) Chelation with Fe3+ results in a chromophore absorbing at 435 nm, which runs
  over a reverse phase column in a single peak at 6.6 min. The shoulder at 7.9 min
  is likely underchelated Fe3+ (2:1 or 1:1 ratio). The trace is normalized to the
  6.6 min peak. (B) A typical TLC photo with CAM staining shows lanes 1 and 5 with
  higher Rf impurities and splotchy staining; lanes 2, 3, and 4 contain HSC as dark
  orange.
