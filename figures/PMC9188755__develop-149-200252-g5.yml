caption: 'Only the first somite pair integrates the anterior axial mesoderm after
  FGFR inhibition. (A) Confocal images after fluorescent in situ hybridization for
  Brachyury2 (green) and DAPI staining (white), and corresponding mesodermal nuclei
  segmentation images of control and SU5402-treated embryos at N2 (21 hpf), N3 (24 hpf)
  and N5 (30 hpf) stages. The notochord nuclei are in green and the somites and tailbud
  nuclei are in magenta. Dorsal views with anterior towards the top. Scale bar: 25 µm.
  (B,C) Graphs presenting the ratio of the number of nuclei of the regions coloured
  in the schemes presented below per the number of nuclei of the mesoderm (excluding
  the tailbud Brachyury2-expressing region) at N2 (B) and N3 (C) stages. One-way ANOVA
  and post-hoc Tukey''s test analysis results are shown. N.S., non-significant, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001, n=4 embryos. Data are median±s.e.m. with the box indicating
  interquartile range. Scale bar: 25 µm.'
