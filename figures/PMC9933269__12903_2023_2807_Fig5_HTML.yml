caption: 'PDH2/HIF-1α signaling pathway activation promoted HK2-mediated glycolysis
  and inflammatory responses. a Protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α
  and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)2 was assessed by western blotting after P. gingivalis
  infection (MOI = 10, 50 or 250) for 1 h. Human gingival fibroblasts were treated
  with HIF-1α inhibitor (10 nM BAY 87–2243) for 2 h before infection with P. gingivalis
  (MOI = 50). b Protein expression of HIF-1α and PHD2 was assessed by western blotting
  at 1 h. c Protein expression of HK2 was assessed by western blotting at 24 h. d,
  e Glucose consumption and HK2 activity were assessed by enzymatic kits at 24 h.
  f Gene transcription was assessed by qPCR at 4 h. β-actin was used as an internal
  reference. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and the Dunnett multiple-comparison test,
  and values are presented as the mean ± SD; *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01, compared
  with the control group; #, p < 0.05 and ##, p < 0.01, compared with the P. g group'
