figure_title: Multi-omics profiling and phenotypic characterization of PDK1 mutant
  CAR-T cells
caption: A, Heatmaps of significant differentially expressed (DE) transcripts in PDK1-gRNA13
  and PDK1-OE CAR-T cell mutants.B, Volcano plot of DE analyses in PDK1-OE CAR-T cells.
  Expression fold-changes and significance are represented by the beta-value and q
  value, respectively.C, Waterfall plots of significantly enriched Biological Process
  ontologies in PDK1-OE CAR-T cells. Results are shown for DAVID analyses of DE genes,
  and significance is provided as the Benjamini-adjusted p value (adj. p). Enrichment
  was assessed separately for up- and downregulated genes, but results are shown together.D,
  Heatmaps of differential metabolite (DM) levels in PDK1-gRNA13 and PDK1-OE CAR-T
  cells.E, Volcano plot of DM levels in PDK1-gRNA13 and PDK1-OE CAR-T cells.F, Waterfall
  plots of integrated transcriptomic-metabolomic MetPA in PDK1-gRNA13 and PDK1-OE
  CAR-T cells. Bar color, size and opacity represent pathway significance and impact
  scores, which summarizing metabolite fold-changes of each pathway.G, Partial pathway
  maps of the TCA cycle in PDK1-gRNA13 and PDK1-OE CAR-T cell mutants. Log2 fold-changes
  of metabolite and gene levels are depicted by ovals and rectangles, respectively
  (heatmap color-scale). Multi-gene enzyme levels were calculated as the log2-fold-changes
  of the sum of normalized gene counts. Metabolomics and transcriptomics data were
  analyzed with n = 5 and n = 3 samples, respectively, for each condition and control.
  DE genes had a beta-change > 1 and q < 0.05, while DM had adjusted-p < 0.10 and
  a log2 fold-change > 0.50. Volcano plot labels are given to genes/metabolites with
  the highest significance and fold-changes, for which significant increases and decreases
  are shown in red and blue, respectively.
