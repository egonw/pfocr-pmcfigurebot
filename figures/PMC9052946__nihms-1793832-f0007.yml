figure_title: IL-33 is a key cytokine driving TH9 polarization induced by DCs stimulated
  with large targets
caption: (A) After transfecting Il33 siRNAs, DCs were stimulated with YLCA or HLCA
  overnight and pulsed with Ova peptide (323–339) for 2 h prior to being co-cultured
  with naïve Rag−/−OT-II CD4+ T cells. Production of IL-9 was assessed by ELISA on
  day 3 of co-culture. Dots represent independent co-cultures. Data are representative
  data of 3 independent experiments.(B) Schematic diagram of Dectin-1 signaling pathway
  and inhibitors of downstream proteins of Dectin-1 signaling.(C) Wild-type and CARD9-deficient
  DCs were stimulated with PFA-fixed YLCA or HLCA overnight, and the expression of
  Il33 was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to Gapdh. n = 4 biological replicates.(D–G)
  DCs were treated with (D) Piceatannol, (E) U73122, (F) SB203580, or (G) U0126 1
  h before stimulation with HLCA. The expression of Il33 was measured by qRT-PCR and
  normalized to Gapdh. n = 3 biological replicates.Results are mean ± SD analyzed
  using (B) two-way ANOVA or (D–G) one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.0001; not significant if it is
  not denoted.
