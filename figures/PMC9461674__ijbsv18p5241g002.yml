caption: SPC25 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation in vitro and in
  vivo. (A) Expression verification of HCC cell lines transfected with lentiviruses
  carrying a human SPC25 overexpression plasmid 7 days after the selection by puromycin
  and 72 hours after the transfection with SPC25 small-interfering RNAs. (B-C) CCK-8
  assay and (D-F) colony formation assay showing the cell growth of the indicated
  HCC cells. (G-H) Representative images (G) and photo flux (H) of the tumor growth
  of Huh7-vector, Huh7-SPC25, SK-Hep1-shControl, and SK-Hep1-shSPC25 in NOD-SCID mice
  on Days 7, 14, and 21. (I) Images of the dissected tumors from the nude mice. (J)
  Tumor weight of each group. (K) Representative images of IHC staining with anti-SPC25
  and anti-Ki67 on the tumors of the tested mice. Images at 100× and 200× magnification.
  All in vitro experiments in triplicate. Error bars represent the mean ± SD. *P <
  0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns means non-significant.
