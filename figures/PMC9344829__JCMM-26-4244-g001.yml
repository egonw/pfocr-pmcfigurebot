caption: The efficiency of PLD1 knockout by CRISPR/Cas 9. (A) The optimal inoculum
  density was 2 cells/well for monoclonal culture. (B) Validation of sgRNA cleavage
  activity through sequence mapping. The three sgRNAs, PCA02629‐3, PCA02631‐3 and
  PCA02634‐3, showed higher cleavage efficiency. (C) Validation of PLD1 gene mutation
  in positive cells by Sanger sequencing. The PC‐11 cells carry insertion A base mutation
  and the PC‐40 cells carry deletion T base mutation (partial sequence). (D) qRT–PCR
  was used to verify the PLD1 mRNA level (E) Western blot analysis confirmed that
  the expression of PLD1 was significantly reduced in PC‐11 and PC‐40 cells
