caption: Effects of chrysin on the expression of SPHK-1 and its signaling proteins
  in hypoxic PC-3 cells. (A) Cells were treated with 10 μM chrysin for 0, 0.5, 4,
  12, and 24 h under hypoxia. Western blotting was performed to determine SPHK-1 and
  HIF-1α expression. Quantitative protein levels are shown in the bar graph as mean
  ± SD for the duplicate. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with
  the hypoxia control. (B) Representative Western blot images and relative densitometric
  bar graphs of SPHK-1, AKT, p-AKT, p-GSK3β, GSK3β, and HIF-1α. Cells were treated
  with chrysin for 4 h under hypoxia or with the hypoxic mimic CoCl2. Western blotting
  was performed to determine SPHK-1, AKT, p-AKT, p-GSK3β, GSK3β, and HIF-1α expression.
  Bar graphs presented as a fold change of control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and ***
  p < 0.001 when compared to the hypoxia control.
