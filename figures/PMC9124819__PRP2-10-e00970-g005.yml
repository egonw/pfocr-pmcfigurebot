caption: 'Key mechanisms in hair cell regeneration. Hair cell regeneration occurs
  by one of two complimentary mechanisms: direct transdifferentiation, in which a
  support cell directly converts into a new hair cell, and mitotic proliferation,
  in which support cells divide producing two daughter cells, one or more of which
  can then differentiate into a new hair cell. Some of the key pathways and genes
  known to play a role in either proliferation or differentiation of HCs during regeneration
  and which have been targets of therapeutic strategies include Wnt/β‐catenin signaling,
  the Notch signaling pathway, P27kip1, Gfi, MYC, and most recently epigenetic regulation
  by HDAC inhibitors and others.'
