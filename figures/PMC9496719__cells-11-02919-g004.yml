caption: 'Analysis of nuclear Atox1-regulated genes. (A). Venn diagrams showing the
  overlap between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by RNA-Seq and
  Atox1-bound genes identified by ChIP-Seq. (B). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  based on those 1387 overlapped DEGs in A. The top 10 enriched pathways ranked by
  the number of DEGs in the pathways are shown here. (C). Top: Heatmap showing the
  expression levels of DEGs belonging to the TNF signaling pathway in RNA-Seq. Color
  scale depicts range of log2 fold changes in gene expression. Bottom: Three selected
  DEGs in this pathway was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (n = 3) *** p < 0.001,
  ** p < 0.01.'
