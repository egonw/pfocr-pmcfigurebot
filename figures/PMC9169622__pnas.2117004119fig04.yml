caption: High GPR126 expression is observed in BC tissues and relates to a poor prognosis.
  (A and B) Western blot analysis of GPR126 in BC tissue (T) and adjacent nontumorous
  breast tissue (N). Fourteen representative paired samples were shown in A. The intensities
  of the immunoblot bands were quantified using ImageJ software and shown in B. The
  data are presented as the mean ± SEM from 14 paired patient samples and Student’s
  t test was used for comparisons between two groups. **P < 0.01. (C and D) IHC analysis
  of GPR126 in BC tissue (T) and adjacent nontumorous breast tissue (N). Two representative
  paired samples are shown in C. The statistic results showed that P < 0.001. The
  scale bar values were 0.216 for non-cancerous tissues and 0.566 for tumors (C).
  Immunoreactive score (IRS) of GPR126 in 42 paired BC samples were evaluated (D).
  The data are represented as the mean ± SEM and Student’s t test was used for comparisons
  between two groups. ***P < 0.001. (E) mRNA levels of GPR97, GPR112, GPR114, GPR126,
  and GPR128 in BC tissue (T) and adjacent nontumorous breast tissue (N) from 112
  patients in TCGA database were calculated and analyzed. (F) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis of the relationship between GPR126 levels and the overall survival rates
  of breast cancer patients. The clinical data from 1,098 patients with breast cancer
  were analyzed and downloaded from TCGA database. High GPR126 expression was statistically
  associated with a shorter overall survival rate.
