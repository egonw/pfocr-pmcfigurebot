caption: 'The inhibitory effect of the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA on ferroptosis induced
  by Rh4 in CRC cells. (a) The relative concentrations of GSH in HT29 and HCT116 cells
  exposed to Rh4-containing medium for 48 hours with or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment
  for 4 hours. (b) The iron concentrations in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to Rh4-containing
  medium for 48 hours with or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment for 4 hours. (c) The
  relative concentrations of lipid ROS in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to Rh4-containing
  medium for 48 hours with or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment for 4 hours. (d) The
  concentrations of MDA in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to Rh4-containing medium
  for 48 hours with or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment for 4 hours. (e) Representative
  Western blot images of ferroptosis-related protein expression in HT29 and HCT116
  cells exposed to Rh4-containing medium for 48 hours with or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment
  for 4 hours. (f), (g) Relative expression levels of proteins involved in the ferroptosis
  pathway in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to Rh4-containing medium for 48 hours with
  or without 2 mM 3-MA pretreatment for 4 hours. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001: statistically
  significant compared with the control group (0 μM Rh4); ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001:
  statistically significant compared with the 200 μM Rh4 group.'
