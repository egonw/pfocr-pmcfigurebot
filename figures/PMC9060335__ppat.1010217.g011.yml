caption: In mock N. benthamiana plants, the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2 leads
  to the ubiquitination and degradation of NbGAI by the 26S proteasome, releasing
  specific transcription factors. Then, genes of the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway
  are adequately regulated by corresponding transcription factors, promoting normal
  growth of N. benthamiana plants. Under ALCScV infection conditions, C4 directly
  interacts with NbGAI, which interferes with the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2
  to prevent the degradation of NbGAI and block the GA signaling pathway, ultimately
  leading to symptoms of plant dwarfing and abnormal flower development.

  degradation, to promote viral infection and symptom development in N. benthamiana.
