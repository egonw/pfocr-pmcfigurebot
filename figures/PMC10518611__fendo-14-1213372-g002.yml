caption: Proposed treatments for NAFLD based on satiety modulators. Figure shows each
  satiety modulator (with their secretion site) and the actual proposed treatments
  with action mechanism for NAFLD resolution. Mice figure represents level of evidence
  (basic), and human figures represent patient studies. NAFLD non-alcoholic fatty
  liver disease; GLP-1 glucagon -like peptide-1; CCK-R cholecystokinin receptor; GPR
  G-protein-coupled receptors; PYY peptide YY; TG triglycerides; SST somatostatin;
  FFA free fatty acids; SREBP sterol regulatory element binding proteins; NASH non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis.
