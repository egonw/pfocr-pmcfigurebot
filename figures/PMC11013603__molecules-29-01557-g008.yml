caption: 'TIIA inhibited the PERK-ATF4-HSPA5 signaling pathway and decreased the GPX4
  level in tumor tissue. M: saline model group, TIIA-L: low dosage of TIIA (20 mg/kg),
  TIIA-H: high dosage of TIIA (50 mg/kg), Sorafenib (60 mg/kg). (a) The expressions
  of PERK, ATF4, HSPA5, GPX4, and p-PERK were detected using Western blot. (b) GSH
  level of tumor tissue. (c) The immunohistochemistry was analyzed. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. model group.'
