caption: FLOT2 activated the MEK/ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in CC.(a) Levels of MEK/ERK1/2
  pathway-related proteins (MEK, p-MER, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2) were measured by Western
  blot analysis. The MEK/ERK1/2 pathway was activated after overexpressing FLOT2 and
  retarded after silencing FLOT2. (b) The levels of AKT pathway-related proteins (AKT
  and p-AKT) were examined by Western blot analysis. The AKT pathway was activated
  after overexpressing FLOT2 and retarded after silencing FLOT2. *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared with the NC group. ^P < 0.05, ^^P < 0.01, and ^^^P
  < 0.001 compared with the siNC group.
