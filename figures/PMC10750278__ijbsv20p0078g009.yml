caption: Effects of knockdown of SECTM1 in U87 MG on in situ tumorigenesis in mice.
  (A) In vivo bioluminescence imaging of mice was detected every 5 days after 7 days
  of in situ tumorigenesis of different cell groups (n=4). (B) The intensity of luciferase
  bioluminescence in mouse brain in situ glioma tissues. (C) HE staining images of
  frozen sections of in situ glioma mouse brain tissues from different groups after
  15 days of imaging, scale bar of 2 mm. (D) Quantitative analysis of relative tumor
  volume in HE staining. (E) EMT markers immunofluorescence staining images of frozen
  brain tissue sections of mice with in situ loaded tumors from different groups.
  Mouse colon tissue as a positive control for E-cadherin antibody and isotype IgG
  as a negative control. (F) Quantitative analysis of EMT markers immunofluorescence
  staining results. The data represent the mean ±SEM of the T-test analysis through
  three independent experiments, *P < 0.05; ** P <0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001.
