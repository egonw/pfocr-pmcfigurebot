caption: Metabolic alterations in HPRT1-knockout tumors. A, Volcano plots showing
  differences in metabolite levels in tumors from HPRT1-deleted DMS273 cells. Metabolomic
  analysis was conducted on SCLC tumors (n = 5) using CE/MS. B, Metabolite pathway
  enrichment analysis of metabolite differences between wild-type and HPRT-knockout
  (KO) tumors. C, Levels of AICAR and metabolites in the pentose phosphate pathway
  in tumors from wild-type and HPRT1-KO DMS273 cells. D, Rescue effect of HPRT1 in
  tumors from HPRT1-KO DMS273 cells transfected with the control vector (KO+V) and
  HPRT1 cDNA (KO+H). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Two-tailed Student t test
  and P values are indicated as *, P < 0.05 and ***, P < 0.005.
