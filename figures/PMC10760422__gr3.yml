caption: OSM elicits multiple signaling pathways and biologic process. (A) HepG2.2.15
  cells were mock-treated or treated with OSM for 24 hours. Total RNA of the cells
  was extracted for RNA-seq analysis. The volcano plots show differentially expressed
  genes in the HepG2.2.15 cells treated with OSM. (qValue ≤ .05, Foldchange >1.8)
  (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment of the differentially
  expressed genes was used to predicate OSM-activated signaling pathway. (C) Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis of the transcription profile was used to predicate OSM-activated
  signaling pathway. (D) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of the differentially expressed
  genes was used to predicate OSM-activated biologic processes. (E) The heat map shows
  different expressed genes with known functions in innate and adaptive immunity.
