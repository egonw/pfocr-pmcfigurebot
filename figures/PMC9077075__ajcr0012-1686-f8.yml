caption: Tumorgenicity of tumorspheres (TS) in vivo. A. Time course of average tumor
  growth in mice inoculated with ES2 TS treated with 5-AZA-dC and/or RAD001. B. Time
  course of average tumor growth in mice inoculated with ES2TR160 TS treated with
  5-AZA-dC and/or RAD001. C. The average weights of tumors grown in mice after inoculations
  with ES2 TS treated with 5aza-dC and/or RAD001 on day 25. D. The average weights
  of tumors grown in mice after inoculations with ES2TR160 TS treated with 5aza-dC
  and/or RAD001 on day 25. (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, all by studentsâ€™ t-test).
