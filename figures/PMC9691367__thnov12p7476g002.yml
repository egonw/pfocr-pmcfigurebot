caption: SIAIS361034 significantly and selectively inhibits Hh pathway activity in
  vitro. (A, B) Dual-luciferase reporter analysis of the inhibitory effect of SIAIS361034
  and SIAIS361034NC against the Hh activity in light II cells exposed to SAG (100
  nM) with or without various concentrations of SIAIS361034 and SIAIS361034NC as indicated
  for 36 h. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 2). (C) IC50 values of SIAIS361034 and SIAIS361034NC
  inhibiting the Gli-luciferase activity provoked by SAG. IC50 values were determined
  by nonlinear regression dose response fit in Graphpad prism 8. (D) RT-qPCR analysis
  of the effect of SIAIS361034 on the mRNA expression of Hh pathway target genes Gli1
  and Ptch1 in the NIH-3T3 cells exposed to SAG with or without SIAIS361034 for 36
  h as indicated. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3).

  pathway inhibitor with capacity of combating resistance to Smoothened inhibitors
  while sparing bone growth.
