figure_title: Diagram of the potential mechanism of the effects of leonurine attenuating
  cardiac fibrosis in heart failure
caption: Leonurine inhibited the activation of Smad2 phosphorylation and regulated
  the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway, thereby the expression of proteins related to
  pyroptosis including Caspase 1 and GSDMD. The release of a large number of inflammatory
  factors like IL-1β caused cardiac fibrosis and promoted the pathological process
  of heart failure. TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TGF R1, transforming growth
  factor receptor 1; TGF R2, transforming growth factor receptor 2; Smad2, small mothers
  against decapentaplegic 2; P-Smad2, phospho-Smad2; IL-1β, Interleukin 1 beta; Caspase
  1, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 1; GSDMD, gasdermin-D.
