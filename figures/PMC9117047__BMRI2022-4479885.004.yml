caption: 'Effect of JDHY on macrophages in ALF rats. (a) ELISA was applied to measure
  sCD163 expression in rat serum. (b) qRT-PCR was applied to determine CD163 expression
  in liver tissues of rats. (c) Western blot was adopted to measure CD163 expression
  in liver tissues of rats. (a)–(c) showed that the expression of CD163 was notably
  upregulated in the ALF+JDHY group (n = 10) and ALF+BAY group (n = 10) compared with
  the ALF group (n = 10). (d) ELISA was utilized to check the content of IL-10, IL-13,
  IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in rat serum. (e) qRT-PCR was adopted to check the
  expression of IL-1β, IL-10, IL-6, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control
  group (n = 6), ##P < 0.01 vs. ALF group (n = 10).'
