caption: VP1 interacts with IRF7. DF-1 cells were cotransfected with pmCherry-VP1
  and pEGFP-IRF7 plasmids. The co-localization of VP1 (red) and IRF7 (green) was detected
  by confocal microscopy (A), and interactions between VP1 (red) and IRF7 (green)
  were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with indicated antibodies (B). Schematic representation
  of the full-length IRF7 (aa 1–492) and truncated IRF7 including IRF7-DBD (aa 1–143)
  and IRF7-∆DBD (aa 143–492) (C). The cells were transfected with a VP1 plasmid together
  with the IRF7-DBD or IRF7-∆DBD construct. (D) The cells were cotransfected with
  VP1 expression plasmid and the indicated IRF7-∆DBD constructs before immunoprecipitation.
