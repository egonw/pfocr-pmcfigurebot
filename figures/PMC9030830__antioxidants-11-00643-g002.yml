caption: 'Rh1 inhibits the cell proliferation induced by Ang II. (A) Cell proliferation
  was evaluated by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. (B,C) Western blot analysis was
  used to analyze indicated protein levels in the whole-cell lysates. (D–F) The immunofluorescence
  analysis was performed after immunostaining using indicated antibodies. DAPI co-staining
  was used to indicate the nuclei of the cells. Representative photographs are shown
  at a magnification of ×200 (scale bar: 30 μm) (D). The relative fluorescence intensity
  of α-SMA (E) and that of PCNA (F) were quantified by Image J software. (A,C,E,F)
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 4), *** p < 0.001 compared with the control,
  # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 compared with the Ang II-treated sample.'
