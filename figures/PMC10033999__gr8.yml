caption: Hepatocyte ferroptosis promoted oxidative DNA damage to activate macrophage
  cGAS-STING signalling.Mice were treated with Fer-1 (5 mg/kg/day, from 2 weeks to
  4 weeks of age) or vehicle, (A) immunohistochemical detection of 8-OHdG in liver
  samples (200× magnification, scale bars = 100 μm), and (B) serum levels of 8-OHdG.
  (C) Level of 8-OHdG in the culture media of primary hepatocytes. (D) Isolated primary
  hepatocytes from TAK1FL/FL or TAK1ΔHEP mice were pretreated with or without Fer-1
  (2 μM) for 6 h and then co-cultured with primary macrophages for 12 h. Primary macrophages
  were harvested to perform Western blots for (E) cGAS-STING signal pathway. TAK1FL/FL
  and TAK1ΔHEP mice were i.p. injected with control IgG or anti-8-OHG antibody from
  2 weeks to 4 weeks of age, primary liver macrophages were isolated for (F) Western
  blots for cGAS-STING signal pathway and (G) RT-qPCR analysis was performed for IFN-β,
  IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS gene expression, (H) serum ALT and AST levels, (I) representative
  H&E staining images in liver sections (200× magnification, scale bars = 100 μm).
  (J) Schematic illustration of how TAK1 deficiency induce hepatocyte ferroptosis
  to promote liver tumorigenesis via macrophage cGAS-STING signalling. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 6). ∗p <0.05 Mann–Whitney U test. ALT, alanine aminotransferase;
  AST, aspartate aminotransferase; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; Fer-1, ferrostatin-1;
  HSC, hepatic stellate cells; IFN-β, interferon-beta; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor
  3; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OGG-1, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase
  1; 8-OHdG, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TAK1,
  transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1;
  TNF-α, tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
