  Epe1-GFP or α-tubulin western from wild-type, sty1Δ, or atf1Δ cells untreated (-)/treated
  (+) with 14mM caffeine.d. Epe1-GFP or a-tubulin western from wild-type, pek1Δ, pmk1Δ,
  atf1Δ or pmp1Δ cells untreated (-)/treated(+) with 14mM caffeine.e. Number of resistant
  colonies formed/1x104 viable cells by wild-type, epe1Δ, pek1Δ and pmp1Δ cells on
  caffeine plates.f. ChIP-qPCR for Epe1-GFP at the indicated locations in wild-type,
  pek1Δ, or pmp1Δ cells cells untreated (-)/treated (+) with 14 mM caffeine. Epe1-GFP
  levels normalised to S.cerevisiae Sgo1-GFP spike-in control. Dots represent 3 biological
  replicates; bars show the mean and error bars are +/-SD. Significance of the difference
  between samples was evaluated using Student’s t-test. (*) P <0.0.33, (**) P <0.002;
  (***) P <0.0002; (****) P <0.0001; (n.s.) not significant.g. Number of resistant
  colonies formed/1x104 viable cells by wild-type, epe1Δ, pek1Δ, Epe1ΔN150 and pek1Δ
  Epe1ΔN150 cells plated on caffeine or fluconazole plates.h. Number of resistant
  colonies formed/1x104 viable cells plated by wild-type, epe1Δ, pek1Δ and pmp1Δ on
  plates containing 0.5mM fluconazole (FLC).Plots e, g and h; Error bars are from
  independent measurements from 3 biological replicates. Data are presented mean values
  +/-SD, with dots representing independent plate counts. The significance of the
  difference between samples was evaluated using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. (*)
