caption: TRIM58 was downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. A A comparison
  of TRIM58 expression between colon adenocarcinoma tissues and normal tissues from
  the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. B Comparison of TRIM58
  expression between CRC tissues and normal tissues from the hospital cohort using
  real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
  C Comparison of TRIM58 expression between CRC tissues and normal tissues from the
  hospital cohort using Western blotting. D Comparison of TRIM58 expression between
  tumor and normal tissues from CRC tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry
  (scale bar, 100 μm). E Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated that the downregulation of
  TRIM58 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with CRC. F, G Bioinformatics
  analyses indicated that TRIM58 was correlated with the genes involved in cell cycle
  and AKT signaling pathway in CRC. H, I qRT-PCR and western blot were used to examine
  the relative mRNA and protein levels of TRIM58 in FHC, SW480, HCT15, SW620, LOVO,
  and SW1417 cells. ***p < 0.001 vs. paracancerous tissues or FHC

  RECQL4 ubiquitination to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway.
