figure_title: KATP channels in capillaries and their impact on CBF
caption: (A) During normal brain activity or under pathophysiological conditions (hypoxia
  and ischemia), neurons and/or astrocytes release adenosine. (B) Adenosine, in turn,
  stimulates KATP channel activity through A2ARs and the GÎ±s-AC-PKA signaling pathway.
  (C) Activation of KATP channels causes profound hyperpolarization of cEC and pericyte
  membranes and (D) enhances CBF.

  cells and pericytes in CNS capillaries.
