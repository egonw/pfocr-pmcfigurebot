caption: 'Terfenadine overcomes MDR in ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting the CAMK2/CREB-mediated
  pathway. (A) Normalized read counts of the CAMK2 family in MDR ovarian cancer cells
  and its parental sensitive ovarian cells (A2780) obtained in the RNA-seq analysis.
  (B) Western blot analysis of p-CAMK2 (T286), CAMK2 (pan), p-CREB1 (s133), and CREB1
  in MDR sensitive ovarian cells (A2780). GAPDH was used as the loading control. (C)
  RNA-seq normalized read counts of CREB1 in MDR ovarian cancer cells and its parental
  sensitive ovarian cancer cells A2780. (D) Upper panel: Western blot analysis of
  p-CAMKII (T286), CAMKII (pan), p-CREB1 (s133), CREB1, ABCB1, and BIRC5 in MDR ovarian
  cancer cells treated for 24 hours with terfenadine (Ter). GAPDH was used as the
  loading control. Lower panel: Western blot analysis of CREB1 and p-CREB1 (s133)
  in the nucleus of MDR ovarian cancer cells treated with terfenadine (Ter) for 6 h.
  Histone H3 (H3C1) was used as the loading control. (E) Western blot analysis of
  CAMK2D in the cytosol or nucleus of terfenadine (Ter)-treated MDR ovarian cancer
  cells for 6 hours. GAPDH and H3C1 were used as the loading controls for cytosol
  protein and nucleus protein, respectively. (F, G) Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)
  for the binding of terfenadine to CAMKIID in MDR ovarian cancer cell lysate. (F)
  Representative western blot images for the CESTA. (G) Tagg curves of CaMKIID in
  MDR ovarian cancer cells in the presence of DMSO or 600 µM of terfenadine. All statistical
  analysis was performed using a two-tailed t-test (*** p < 0.001).'
