caption: Hippo-YAP pathway signaling and function. YAP signaling is negatively regulated
  through a cascade of phosphorylation events mediated by MST1/2 and LATS1/2, which
  leads to phosphorylation of YAP and subsequent proteasomal degradation or retention
  in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, YAP can be inactivated by binding to angiomotin,
  PTPN14 and zonula occludens. Signaling events triggered by GPCR and Rho can activate
  YAP by inducing its nuclear translocation. YAP target genes are involved in aspects
  of organ development, regeneration, and malignant transformation.
