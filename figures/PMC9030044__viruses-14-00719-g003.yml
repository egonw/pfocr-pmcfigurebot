caption: 'Transcriptomic characteristics in the lungs of the SP and RP groups after
  infection. Heatmap of DEGs after infection in the RPs (A) and SPs (B). Scatter diagrams
  of the enriched metabolic pathways of the DEGs (gene with up- and downregulated
  expression) are shown for the RPs (C) and SPs (D). Each dot represents a metabolic
  pathway, the ordinate shows the name of the pathway, and the abscissa shows the
  enrichment factor, indicating the proportion of DEGs annotated to the pathway compared
  to the proportion of all genes annotated to the pathway. (E) PPI network of the
  DEGs during primary infection with SIVmac239 in the RPs and SPs. The nodes represent
  proteins, and the edges represent protein–protein interactions. Heatmaps of several
  DEGs in every infected sample (F) and the two groups (G) are shown. The color represents
  the expression level: from green to red indicates that the expression level is from
  low to high. SP: n = 3, RP: n = 3, SIV-: n = 4.'
