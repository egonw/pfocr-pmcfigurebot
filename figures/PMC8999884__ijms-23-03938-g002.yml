caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) enhances human endometrial epithelial
  cell proliferation through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway.
  (A) pSMAD-2 level detected by Western blotting after treatment with 5, 10, and 25
  µM DEHP for 24 h. β-actin was used as the internal loading control for data normalization.
  (B) LY2109761 (0.1 to 20 μM) displays cellular toxicity dose-dependently. (C) LY2109761
  (0.1 to 10 μM) represses pSMAD-2 and SOX2 protein levels, as detected using Western
  blot analysis. β-actin was used as the internal loading control for data normalization.
  (D) TGF-βR2 and pSMAD-2 protein levels and quantitative analysis of their protein
  levels after treatment with 25 µM DEHP and LY2109761. β-actin was used as the internal
  loading control for data normalization. DEHP—induced cell proliferation is completely
  abrogated by LY2109761−mediated TGF−β/Smad signaling inhibition. Representative
  fluorescence micrographs of K-67 staining (blue: DAPI; red: K-67). All data are
  expressed as relative values against their respective control group. Data represent
  the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); # p < 0.05 and ### p < 0.001 (vs. DEHP
  treatment). Scale bars = 20 μm.'
