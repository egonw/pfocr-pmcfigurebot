caption: HIF-1α/miR-494/Survivin signaling pathway may be responsible for hypoxia-mediated
  TNBC DTX-resistance. qPCR analysis of miR-494 expression (A) in hypoxic TNBC cells
  treated with HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478 or HIF-1α knockdown (KD) plasmid; (B) in normoxic
  TNBC cells treated with HIF-1α overexpression (OE) plasmid; (C) in hypoxic TNBC
  cells treated by PX-478 with or without HIF-1α OE plasmid. (D) Western blot analysis
  of the Survivin protein level from hypoxic TNBC cells treated with PX-478, with
  or without miR-494 inhibitor. (E) Western blot analysis of the Survivin protein
  level from hypoxic TNBC cells treated with miR-494 mimics, with or without HIF-1α
  OE plasmid. Overexpression of Survivn significantly (F) decreased the growth-inhibitory
  effect of DTX combined with miR-494 in hypoxic TNBC cells by CCK-8 assay; (H) and
  decreased hypoxic TNBC cells apoptosis level by DNA fragmentation assays; Inhibition
  of Survivin significantly (G) increased the growth-inhibitory effect of miR-494
  inhibitor in normoxic TNBC cells to DTX by CCK-8 assay; (I) increased apoptosis
  level by DNA fragmentation assays. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Each bar represents the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
