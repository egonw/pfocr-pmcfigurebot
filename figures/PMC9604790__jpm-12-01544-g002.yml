caption: 'Landscape of the genetic alterations dysregulating the Hippo pathway and
  YAP/TAZ in HNSCC. The landscape was created by c-BioPortal for Cancer Genomics (https://www.cbioportal.org
  accessed on 19 September 2022) by analyzing the data of the HNSCC TCGA, PanCancer
  Atlas (2015). Abbreviations are: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FAT atypical
  cadherin 1 (FAT1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), vav guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor 2 (VAV2), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type
  14 (PTPN14), AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), bromodomain containing protein
  4 (BRD4), Cyclin dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), and Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1).'
