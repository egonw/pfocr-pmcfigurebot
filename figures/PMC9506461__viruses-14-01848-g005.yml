caption: 'Different gene expression profile of MS-1 induced by MeSG. (A) RNA-seq and
  DEG analysis. Expression heatmap of DEGs between MeSG-treated (100 nM) and non-treated
  MS-1 control cells (+vehicle) is shown. (B) Results of the ShinyGO pathway enrichment
  analysis for the differentially expressed genes. P53, apoptosis, PI3K/AKT and MAPK
  signaling pathways were identified as potential biological processes associated
  with MeSG. (C) Gene changes in cancer cell lines (A549 and MS−1) treated by schweinfurthin
  analogs. (D) Analysis of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways in MS-1 treated with MeSG. MeSG
  (1 μM, 48 h) downregulates MCPyV T antigen proteins, phosphorylation of AKT, p44/42
  (ERK1/2), p90RSK, and S6 ribosomal protein (the downstream target of both PI3K/AKT
  and MAPK) in MS-1. tLT: tumor-derived large T. (E) MeSG modulates the multiple pathways
  involved in PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways to induce apoptotic cell death of MCC cell
  lines. The long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be essential in MCC progression.'
