caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites. (a) Pathway
  analysis of group M versus group T based on mass spectrometry combined with high-performance
  liquid chromatography. (b) Pathway analysis of group M versus group T based on mass
  spectrometry combined with gas chromatography. Each bubble represents a metabolic
  pathway; the bubble size represents the influence factor, the larger the size, the
  larger the influence factor; the vertical coordinate of the bubble and the color
  of the bubble indicate the P value of the enrichment analysis; the darker the color,
  the smaller the P value, the more significant the enrichment.
