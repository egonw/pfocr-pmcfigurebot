caption: Expression levels of the structural DEGs in the proline metabolic pathway
  and the proline contents in the DM plantlets under salt stress. (A) Differential
  expression of the structural DEGs in KEGG enrichment analysis. The green rectangle
  represents the DEGs down-regulated; the red rectangle represents the DEGs up-regulated;
  the blue rectangle represents both up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs. The proline
  metabolic pathway is highlighted by orange dotted frame. (B) Heat map of the structural
  DEGs in the proline metabolic pathway. (C) Changes of the proline contents in aboveground
  parts of DM text-tube plantlets under the 200-mM NaCl treatments. Data presented
  as mean ± standard error from three biological replicates were tested by one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA). Different letters represent statistically significant
  differences (α = 0.05).
