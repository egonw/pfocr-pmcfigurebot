caption: MkMPs activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in CD34+ HSPCs by targeting PTEN and
  mediate JNK signaling. (a,b) CD34+ HSPCs were co-cultured with MkMPs or vehicle
  control. Cells were harvested after 24 h of co-culture, and the level of targets
  including mTOR, p-mTOR, and Akt were examined by immunoblotting with GAPDH as the
  loading control. (a) Representative immunoblot images out of 4 replicates. (b) Semi-quantification
  of p-mTOR expression from immunoblot images (n = 4). The expression levels for p-mTOR
  were normalized to the expression of GAPDH. (c–e) CD34+ HSPCs were pretreated with
  a signaling inhibitor (JNK, Akt, or mTOR inhibitor), or inhibitor vehicle (without
  an inhibitor), and were co-cultured with MkMPs or without (vehicle control). Cells
  were harvested after 24 h of co-culture, and the level of p-mTOR, Akt, and p-Akt
  were examined and quantified by flow cytometric analysis (n = 3–5). Mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) represents the protein expression/levels averaged over the total
  cell population. Representative histograms of each target are shown on the right.
  The Y-axis represents the event (cell) count for each specific fluorescent intensity
  (f,g) CD34+ HSPCs pretreated with JNK inhibitor or solution without an inhibitor
  were co-cultured with MkMPs or vehicle control for 24 h. (f) PTEN protein expression
  was quantified by flow cytometric analysis, while (g) PTEN mRNA levels were quantified
  by qPCR analysis. (h) Schematic diagram of signaling pathway triggered by MkMPs
  in CD34+ HSPCs, based on the results from (a–f). Error bars in (b) represent the
  standard error of mean of 2–4 biological replicates, while error bars in (c–g) represent
  the standard error of mean of 3–5 biological replicates. Statistical comparison
  analysis was performed between each experimental group against MkMP control (without
  inhibitor). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
