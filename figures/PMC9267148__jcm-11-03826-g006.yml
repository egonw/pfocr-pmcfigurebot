caption: Protein interaction networks of CIAPIN1 and related proteins of scramble-treated
  CCA cells. CIAPIN1 interacted directly with nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), and
  indirectly with mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2) and transforming
  growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFÎ²R1). Thicker lines represent strong associations.
  Thin lines represent weak associations.
