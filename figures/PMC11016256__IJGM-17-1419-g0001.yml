caption: 'Targets of some miRNAs in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. There are three
  main points in this diagram: (1) TGF-β ligands bind to heterodimeric complexes of
  type II and type I receptors, phosphorylating type II receptors and activating type
  I receptors. (2) Activated type I receptors phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3. (3) Smad2/3
  dimer forms a trimeric complex with Smad4 and translocates to the nucleus to regulate
  the transcription of target genes positively or negatively. (4) The targets of action
  of some miRNAs are also labeled in the figure, where red indicates pro-fibrotic
  miRNAs and blue ones indicate miRNAs that inhibit fibrosis.'
