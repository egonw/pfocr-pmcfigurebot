caption: Transcriptomic analysis of the LPS response of WT and mutant (Abcd1−/−Abcd2−/−
  and Acox1−/−) BV-2 cells (n = 3 for each genotype). (A) Pie chart displaying the
  number of up- or downregulated DEGs after a 24-h LPS treatment (DataSet GSE237635).
  The significant genes (number and percentage) were selected using a cutoff adjusted
  p-value (DESeq2 Wald test with Benjamini and Hochberg p-value adjustment) lower
  than 0.05 and an absolute log2 FC higher than 1. Additional comparison to test if
  the effect of the LPS treatment is different between the mutant and the WT genotypes,
  which permitted to highlight the proportion of significantly (AdjP Value < 0.05)
  more repressed (dark blue) (Log2FC < 1) or induced (dark red) (Log2FC > 1) DEGs,
  indicated by the left and right bars, respectively. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis
  in each genotype presenting a selection of the three main gene ontology biological
  process (up) and KEGG pathway (down) terms selected by FDR (in brackets) and sorted
  by Fold Enrichment (abscissa axis). (C) Comparative analysis of the sets of DEGs
  using the Venn diagram illustrating the larger increase of upregulated (up) and
  downregulated (down) DEGs in LPS-treated mutant cells as compared to WT. The number
  in brackets represents the number of DEGs belonging to the intersection significantly
  more deregulated (p < 0.05) in the mutant than in the WT genotype (Wald test).
