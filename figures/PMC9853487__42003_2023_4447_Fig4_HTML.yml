figure_title: Single-cell transcriptional signatures of clonal expansion of CD8 T
  cells
caption: a UMAP visualization of 70,237 CD8 T cell single-cell transcriptomes from
  the ISB-S CD8 dataset pooled across samples and conditions. 15 clusters identified
  using the Louvain algorithm. b Two-dimensional density plot of cells from each disease
  condition (healthy donor, mild, moderate, severe) by UMAP coordinates. Red represents
  areas of high density of cells of a given condition; blue represents areas of low
  density. c UMAP visualization with cells labeled by top eight most frequent CD8
  TCR clusters identified by the GLIPH2 analysis. d Two-dimensional density plot of
  cells with high or low pGen score clonotypes by UMAP coordinates. Yellow represents
  areas of high density of cells; black represents areas of low density. e Boxplots
  of clonally expanded cell proportions (in Expanded group) for each disease condition
  (cell count healthy donor = 2579, mild = 18,622, moderate = 15,743, severe = 7159).
  Comparison between groups performed with two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. f Volcano
  plot of differentially expressed genes between clonally expanded cells and all other
  cells in the ISB-S CD8 dataset (Expanded group cells = 5000, all other cells = 5000).
  Differential gene expression was performed with Seurat using the two-sided Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test; the Bonferroni corrected adjusted p-values and log fold-change of
  the average expression were used for visualization. g Bar plot of biological processes
  (BP) pathway terms associated with downregulated genes (clonally expanded cells
  vs all other cells, q-value < 1e-4) by DAVID analysis. h Bar plot of biological
  processes (BP) pathway terms associated with upregulated genes (clonally expanded
  cells vs all other cells, q-value < 1e-4) by DAVID analysis.
