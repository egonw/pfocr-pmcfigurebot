caption: Inhibitory effects of KRG extracts on DEP-induced MUC5AC mRNA expression
  and protein production. To confirm the effects of ginseng extracts on MUC5AC mRNA
  expression and protein synthesis induced by DEP, we performed real-time PCR and
  ELISA analyses at different pretreatment combinations. (A, B) KRG (0.25 mg/ml) and
  saponin (25 μg/ml), respectively, inhibited DEP-induced MUC5AC mRNA expression and
  protein production. Bars indicate the means  SD of three independent experiments
  conducted in triplicate. ∗p < 0.05 versus the zero value, †p < 0.05 versus DEP (20 μg/ml).
  DEP, diesel exhaust particles; KRG, Korean Red Ginseng; SD, standard deviation.
article_title: Saponin attenuates diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-induced MUC5AC expression
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation via TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in airway epithelium and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice.
