figure_title: CAFs-derived sEVs promote the growth of CRC cells in vitro
caption: A Assessment of the viability of HCT 116 and HT-29 cells co-cultured with
  sEVs by colony formation assays. B CCK8 assays are used to determine the proliferation
  of CRC cells co-cultured with sEVs. C Flow cytometry shows significant increases
  or decreases in the proportion of cells in S or G1-phase, respectively when HCT
  116 and HT-29 cells are co-cultures with CAF-sEVs. D Cells were treated with cisplatin
  (5ug/ml for 24 h). Flow cytometry is used to detect the apoptotic rates (LR + UR)
  of cells. LR, early apoptotic cells; UR, terminal apoptotic cells. Data are shown
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ns. not significant.
