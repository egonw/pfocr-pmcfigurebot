caption: Canonical and noncanonical (Wingless-Int) Wnt signaling pathways. These pathways
  are activated when a Wnt ligand binds to the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor. The active
  canonical pathway is mediated by Î²-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and
  acts as a coactivator of the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
  factor family (TCF/LEF), leading to upregulation of Wnt target genes. The two main
  noncanonical pathways are the Wnt/calcium and planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways.
  In the Wnt/calcium pathway, Wnt binding to Fzd activates Disheveled (Dvl), which
  stimulates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, activating protein kinase
  C (PKC) and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII) and, in turn, the transcription
  factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The Wnt/PCP pathway is mediated
  by the Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and Ras guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)
  that lead to the activation of the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) or N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) axis. Created with BioRender.com.
