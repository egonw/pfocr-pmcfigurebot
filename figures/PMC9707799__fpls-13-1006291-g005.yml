caption: Correlation analysis of transcriptome and proteome. (A) Venn diagram of proteins
  expression and genes expression. (B) KEGG pathway of DEGs corresponding to DEPs.
  Red represents up-regulated and green represents down-regulated. FhirtaA VS FhirtaB
  represent multiples of transcript expression in both A phase and B phase of F hirta
  bracts. CuA VS CuB represents multiples of protein expression in both A phase and
  B phase of F hirta bracts. Fold Change (FC) represents multiples of genes/proteins
  expression in two groups. (C) GO categorization of DEGs corresponding to DEPs.
article_title: Multi-omics analysis the differences of VOCs terpenoid synthesis pathway
  in maintaining obligate mutualism between Ficus hirta Vahl and its pollinators.
