caption: Control of SAP activity in C. auris by the Ras/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.
  (A–C) A comparison of SAP activities of C. auris wild-type and Ras/cAMP/PKA mutant
  strains at various temperatures. Cells of the wild-type and mutants tpk1Δ tpk2Δ
  (YSBA24), cdc25Δ (YSBA61), cyr1Δ (YSBA21), ras1Δ (YSBA41), gpa2Δ (YSBA39), ras1Δ
  gpa2Δ (YSBA68), and gpr1Δ (YSBA46) were cultured overnight, washed twice with deionized
  water (dH2O), and resuspended in 1 mL dH2O. We spotted 3 µL of the resuspended cell
  onto solid YCB-BSA media and incubated them for 3 days at (A) 30°C, (B) 37°C, and
  (C) 42°C. The values indicated below each figure represent the average halo thickness.
  Three biologically independent experiments were performed and one representative
  data are shown here. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Statistical analysis
  was performed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test (*P
  < 0.05; ****P < 0.0001).
