caption: Analytical normal phase HPLC of the Mc2-Ac-hex. Different components (peaks)
  of the Mc2-Ac-hex fraction were resolved using a silica column at a gradient of
  chloroform (35–39%) against hexane (65–61%) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a
  runtime of 15 min. The chromatogram depicts the elution profile with absorbance
  measured at 270 nm. Injection volume-15 µl (1 mg/ml dissolved in hexane)
article_title: Anti-leukemic principle(s) from Momordica charantia seeds induce differentiation
  of HL-60 cells through ERK/MAPK signalling pathway.
