figure_title: H3.3G34R pHGG mediates cytokine and DAMP release via cGAS/STING pathway
  activation
caption: (A) Scheme illustrating the cGAS/STING pathway and the link between cytosolic
  dsDNA and activation of the immune system. (B) Release of IFN-β in H3.3-G34R and
  H3.3-WT mouse cells in response to 3 Gy IR and inhibition of IFN-β release by the
  STING inhibitors GSK690693 and H151. (C) Levels of soluble DAMP ATP in H3.3-G34R
  and H3.3-WT mouse cells in response to 3 Gy IR and inhibition of the cGAS/STING
  pathway with GSK690693 (STING-dependent IRF3 activation inhibitor); H151 (STING
  inhibitor); JSH23 (NF-κB activation inhibitor); and PDTC (NF-κB inhibitor). (D)
  Levels of soluble DAMP HMGB1 in H3.3-G34R and H3.3-WT mouse cells in response to
  IR and inhibition of the cGAS/STING pathway with the inhibitors GSK690693, H151,
  JSH23, and PDTC. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, and ****P < 0.001; unpaired
  t test (B–D). Data in B–D represent the mean ± SD of 3 experimental replicates.
