caption: 'FTO‐mediated m6A modification of suppressors of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1)
  messenger RNA (mRNA) decreases its protein expression due to loss of FTO: (A) pie
  chart of m6A locus distribution in controlsand FTO overexpression HMC cells; (B)
  m6A enriched for known consensus motif RAACH using HOMER; (C) m6A‐enriched peak
  distribution on the metagene using guitar; (D) RNA‐seq and MeRIP‐seq identified
  differentially expressed genes or m6A peaks in FTO stable overexpression HMC cells
  when compared with their corresponding controls; (E) enriched pathway analyses of
  significantly altered m6A peaks after FTO overexpression. p Values were calculated
  according to the hypergeometric test based on the number of physical entities present
  in both the predefined set and user‐specified list of physical entities; (F) the
  m6A abundances on SOCS1 mRNA transcripts in HMC cells as detected by MeRIP‐seq were
  plotted; (G) MeRIP‐qPCR analysis was employed to demonstrate FTO‐mediated SOCS1
  m6A modifications. The m6A modification of SOCS1 was decreased on the upregulation
  of FTO; (H) Western blot analyses of indicated proteins in HMC or HK‐2 cells after
  FTO overexpression; (I) meRIP‐PCR analysis of SOCS1 mRNA level in HMC cells after
  overexpressing wild‐type or mutant FTO wild‐type; (J) FTO‐RIP‐PCR analysis of SOCS1
  mRNA level in HMC cells. Data are represented as mean  ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses
  were performed by two‐tailed unpaired student t‐tests and corrected for multiple
  comparisons using the Holm‐Sidak method.'
