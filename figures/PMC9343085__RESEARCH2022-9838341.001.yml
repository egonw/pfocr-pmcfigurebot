caption: Data-driven modeling of the three cell death pathways induced by NLRP1b inflammasome.
  (a) Schematic diagram of lethal toxin (LT) induced NLRP1b inflammasomes assembly
  and downstream signaling activation. (b) Kinetic scheme of the three newly identified
  death pathways induced by NLRP1b inflammasome activation. The dashed lines labelled
  with Bid indicate the indirect activation of caspase-9 by caspase-1 through the
  intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The gray dashed lines describe the direct slight cleavage
  of caspase-3 by caspase-1. (c, d) Effects of genetic deletion of Gsdmd or Casp1
  on inflammasome-induced LDH release and cell survival for indicated times. (e) Western
  blot analysis of the effects of deletion of Gsdmd or Casp1 on indicated protein
  activation. (f) Comparison between experimental data (dots) and simulation results
  (lines) in RAW-asc, Gsdmd−/−, and Casp1−/− cells. (g) Scatter diagram of experimental
  data versus simulation results. R2 represents the deviation between experimental
  data and simulation results.
