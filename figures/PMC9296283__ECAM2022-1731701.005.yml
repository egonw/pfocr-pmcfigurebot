caption: 'Curcumin pretreatments inhibited cell apoptosis in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation
  (OGD/R)-injured astrocyte. (a) The apoptosis ratio evaluated by Annexin V/propidium
  iodide (PI) assay. (b) Summary of data showing changes in apoptosis ratio. (c–g)
  Representative images and summary of data for relative protein expressions of BCL-2-associated
  X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and cleaved caspase 3 through western blot analysis.
  Versus control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, respectively; versus
  OGD/R group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 (n = 3).'
