caption: LINC00092 was modulated by FLI1 in BC cells. (a, b) Bioinformatics analysis
  was utilized to predict the relationship between FLI1 and LINC00092. (c, d) Following
  mock or FLI1 transfection, the FLI1 and LINC00092 expressions in cells were measured
  via qPCR. N = 3. (e, f) ChIP assay was carried out to test the binding between FLI1
  and LINC00092 promoter in cells. N = 3. (g, h) Dual-luciferase activity assay was
  carried out to confirm the binding between FLI1 and LINC00092 promoter. N = 3. N.S.P
  > 0.05, ∗P < 0.05, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
