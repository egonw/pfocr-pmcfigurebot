caption: 'Overexpression of SUN5 partly attenuated the inhibition of proliferation
  and migration of CRC cells by PD0325901. (A,B) The Western blotting analysis of
  the pERK1/2 level in CRC cells treated with different concentrations of PD0325901
  (0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 µM) for 48 h. “Ctrl” indicates the control group with the
  added solvent (DMSO). (C,D) The cell proliferation and migration ability were evaluated
  by CCK8 (two-way ANOVA); colony-formation (t-test) and Transwell (t-test); and wound-healing
  assays (two-way ANOVA), respectively (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). Scale
  bar: 100 μm (above), 200 μm (below).'
