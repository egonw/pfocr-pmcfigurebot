caption: 'Molecular pathways depicting the microbiome-induced EMT and chronic inflammation.
  F. nucleatum: E. coli strains producing genotoxic compound colibactin can bind to
  the DNA leading to DNA damage by triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating
  the Erk pathway. Activation of Erk stimulates Vimentin and N-cadherin expression,
  leading to EMT. Microbes express microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)
  and are recognized by macrophages via TLRs. They can either produce ROS from macrophages
  or trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23,
  and TNF) via various signaling pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines can activate
  STAT3 and NF-κB signaling, leading to activation of c-myc oncogene and MMP13, respectively,
  which progress to EMT, chronic inflammation, and eventually cancer. Simultaneously,
  virulence factors, FadA and BFT, can disrupt E-cadherin and trigger β-catenin/Wnt
  signaling pathways resulting in subsequent activation of the STAT3 and NF-κB pathways.'
