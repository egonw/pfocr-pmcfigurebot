caption: APAP‐induced xCT expression in proliferative hepatocytes increases cystine
  uptake. (A) Primary hepatocytes were isolated from mice 48 h after PBS or APAP injection.
  xCT (Slc7a11) mRNA levels of the hepatocytes were measured using qPCR. (B) The hepatocytes
  were fractioned to obtain plasma membranes and cytosol samples and then used for
  immunoblot analysis. The levels of E‐cadherin and GAPDH were assessed as protein
  markers for plasma membrane and cytosolic fraction, respectively. Cyt, cytosolic
  fraction; Mem, membrane fraction. (C) Exported glutamate level was quantified in
  the media after incubation of the hepatocytes for 5 h. (D) Graphical representation
  of transsulfuration pathway and system xc−‐mediated glutathione synthesis. (E) Isolated
  primary hepatocytes from mice 48 h after PBS or APAP injection were incubated in
  cystine‐free medium supplemented with universal 13C6‐labeled cystine or methionine‐free
  medium supplemented with 34S‐labeled methionine for 6 h. The bar graph shows the
  proportions of labeled‐ metabolites in cell lysates. (F) Proposed graphical representation
  of system xc−‐mediated glutathione synthesis in hepatic progenitor cell. (G) Relative
  cell viability of differentiated hepatocyte (DH) upon treatment with erastin for
  48 h. The effect of erastin on cell proliferation of hepatic progenitor cell (HPC)
  was assessed using IncuCyte S3. (A–C and E) Data are presented as mean ± SD; *p < .05,
  **p < .01, ***p < .001 and n.s. not significant, compared PBS‐injected group, analysed
  by unpaired student's t‐test
