caption: Transcriptional evidence of an increase in neuroinflammation in HIV Tg rats
  that self-administered oxycodone under nondependent (short access (ShA)) conditions.
  Pathway analysis by GSEA provided evidence of (A,B) broad immune activation and
  (C) the induction of cytokine signaling, including (D) interferon (IFN) signaling,
  (E) Toll signaling, (F) TGFÎ², (G) SHP2 signaling, and (H) complement and coagulation
  cascades. Each bar represents a gene in the gene set []. HIV ND, HIV Tg rats that
  self-administered oxycodone under nondependent (ShA) conditions; WT ND, wildtype
  rats that self-administered oxycodone under nondependent conditions. NES = normalized
  enrichment score [].
