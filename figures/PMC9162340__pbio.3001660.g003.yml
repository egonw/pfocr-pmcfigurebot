figure_title: The cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of Punt harbors the BLT determinant
caption: '(A) The juxtamembrane region of Punt in the context of the ECD, TM, and
  KD []. The BLT region, as delimited by behavior of chimeric and truncation constructs,
  is indicated. Amino acid sequence alignment of several insect Punt homologs revealed
  a core conserved sequence between the predicted transmembrane helix and the KD.
  The sequence of internal deletions (Δ10 and Δ19) relative to Punt WT is shown; all
  constructs in this series harbor a K to L point mutation. (B–D) Deletion of the
  BLT degrades the basolateral restriction of Punt protein expressed in wing disc
  epithelia with A9-GAL4, detected with anti-Punt IF. Single prime (′) images are
  xz projections at the plane indicated by the short yellow lines. Yellow arrowheads
  indicate position and direction of RGB profile shown in double prime (′′) images;
  the asterisk in C′′ indicates signal outside the cell layer that does not correspond
  to surface protein. (E–H) Deletion of the BLT also destroyed basolateral restriction
  in MDCK cells. Punt was detected mainly in the lateral membrane region (F), whereas
  Punt-Δ10 and Punt-Δ19 displayed robust apical staining (level marked by red arrows)
  in addition to basolateral staining (G, H). DAPI staining labels nuclei (blue) and
  receptor was visualized by anti-HA IF (red). Scale bars: 50 μm for B-D, B′-D′; 25
  μm F-H. See  for evidence of activity of internal deletion proteins and  for corroborating
  results using a different GAL4 driver and epitope antibody. BLT, basolateral targeting;
  ECD, extracellular domain; KD, kinase domain; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TM,
  transmembrane region; WT, wild-type.'
