figure_title: Cell-cell interaction analysis between the different lung cell populations
  after different time points and doses of IR
caption: 'a Circle plot showing the differential number of interactions between IR10Gy
  and IR17Gy in the main cellular compartments at 3 M, 4 M, and 5 M post-IR: mesenchymal,
  endothelial, epithelia, myeloid and lymphoid. Red (or blue) colored edges represent
  increased (or decreased) signaling in the IR17Gy compared to the IR10Gy. b Heatmap
  showing the differential number of interactions between IR10Gy and IR17Gy in the
  endothelial and mesenchymal subpopulations at 3 M, 4 M, and 5 M post-IR. Red (or
  blue) represents increased (or decreased) signaling in the IR17Gy compared to the
  IR10Gy. The top-colored bar plot represents the sum of column of values displayed
  in the heatmap (incoming signaling). The right-colored bar plot represents the sum
  of row of values (outgoing signaling). c Bar graph showing significant signaling
  pathways ranked based on differences in the overall information flow within the
  inferred networks between IR5M10Gy and IR5M17Gy from the Fibroblasts Col14a1 and
  Myofibroblasts (sources) to the gCap (targets). The top signaling pathways colored
  red are enriched after IR5M10Gy, and the ones colored green were enriched after
  IR5M17Gy. d Increased signaling ligand-receptor pairs of the Collagen pathway in
  IR10Gy and IR17Gy compared to NI at 3 M, 4 M, and 5 M after IR. e Schematic drawing
  of the intercellular communication between fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with the
  gCap through the collagen pathway.'
