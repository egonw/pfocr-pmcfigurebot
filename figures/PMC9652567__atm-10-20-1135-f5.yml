caption: Atorvastatin inhibited oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway, thus playing a role in the brain protection of mice with cerebral infarction.
  (A) The expression levels of SOD were detected by SOD kits. (B) The protein levels
  of HO-1 and NQO1 at 72 h. (C) Quantiﬁcation of relative protein expression normalized
  to β-tubulin. (D) The protein level of P62 at 72 h. (E) Quantiﬁcation of relative
  protein expression normalized to GAPDH. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001. SOD, superoxide
  dismutase; Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; Sham, control; Atorv, atorvastatin;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; .
