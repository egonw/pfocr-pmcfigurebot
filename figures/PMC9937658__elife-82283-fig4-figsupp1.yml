  stress response with perturbation of mitochondrial gene expression
caption: 'qPCR of genes involved in the ISR for six tissues from animals fed a chow
  diet for 6 months: Gdf15 (A) and Fgf21 (B). Each data point represents data from
  a separate animal. Target gene CT values were normalised against three housekeeping
  genes (36b4, B2m, and Hprt) and expressed relative to WT liver for each gene. p-Values
  are FDR-adjusted for multiple tests. Serum FGF-21 (C) and GDF-15 (D) after 6 months
  of chow diet or HFD. Western blots from inguinal WAT (E), skeletal muscle (F), and
  heart (G) illustrating Ser51-phosphorylation of eIF2α and expression of Mthfd2 with
  calnexin (Canx) as loading control. Western blots are representative of at least
  three biological replicates. Mthfd2 in heart (G) is the upper band within the box,
  as indicated by a horizontal line. (H) Heatmap of all genes from the citrate acid
  (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle KEGG pathway. Colour illustrates the Log2 fold
  change normalised per gene. Those annotated with orange in the leftmost column had
  significant differential gene expression (DGE) with p-FDR <0.001. (I) Heatmaps comparing
  mRNA expression of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes from inguinal
  WAT from HFD-fed animals. Asterisks indicate p-values from pairwise comparisons
  (T-tests) between WT and Mfn2R707W KI that are FDR-adjusted for multiple tests (***
  p-FDR <0.001). Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1.Raw and annotated immunoblots
