figure_title: miR-661 enhances tumorigenicity of ESCC by reducing PPM1L expression
caption: A The top five miRNAs as microRNA response elements for circFAM120B. B RIP
  assays using an anti-AGO2 antibody, followed by qRT-PCR analysis, confirm the interactions
  between circFAM120B and miR-661. C A schematic representation of the 3’-UTR of circFAM120B
  with the predicted target site for miR-661, as well as the mutant sites of circFAM120B.
  Luciferase reporter analysis was performed to evaluate the binding between miR-661
  and circFAM120B. Reporter constructs containing either circFAM120B-wt or circFAM120B-mut
  were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, along with miR-661 or miR-NC mimics. D The
  proliferation of ESCC cells transfected with miR-661 mimics or inhibitors was evaluated
  by CCK-8 assay (n = 5 biologically independent replicates). E Colony formation assays
  were performed in ESCC cells transfected with miR-661 mimics or inhibitors (n = 3
  biologically independent replicates). F Analysis of proliferating ESCC cells transfected
  with miR-661 mimics or inhibitors by EdU assay (n = 3 biologically independent replicates).
  G Migration and invasion of ESCC cells transfected with miR-661 mimics or inhibitors
  were evaluated by Transwell assays (n = 3 biologically independent replicates).
  H Venn diagram showing the potential mRNAs targeted by miR-661. I A schematic representation
  of the 3’-UTR of PPM1L with the predicted target site for miR-661 and the mutant
  sites of PPM1L. Luciferase reporter analysis was performed to evaluate the binding
  between miR-661 and PPM1L. Reporter constructs containing either PPM1L-wt or PPM1L-mut
  were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, along with miR-661 mimics or miR-NC. J Expression
  of PPM1L was assessed by qRT-PCR in ESCC cells transfected with miR-661 mimics or
  inhibitors. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
