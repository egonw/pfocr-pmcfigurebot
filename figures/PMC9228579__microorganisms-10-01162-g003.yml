caption: 'Mechanism of host immune response in NiV infection. Innate immune response
  upon NiV infection: Neutrophils are one of the first immune cells to be recruited
  to the site of infection. These cells use NET and antiviral molecules to contain
  the virus in web-like traps. To counteract this, some NiV proteins are capable of
  inhibiting the IFN response by interacting with the JAK/STAT pathway. Adaptive immune
  response upon NiV infection: Following NiV entry via ephrin-B2 or -B3 receptors
  on the host cellular membrane, it is engulfed and broken down into viral peptides
  by APC such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The presentation of the viral peptides
  on the MHC molecules activates the T cells through their TCR. The activation of
  the helper T cells subsequently drives B cells to activate, proliferate and develop
  a mature antibody response. As a result, plasma cells and memory B cells are formed,
  producing NiV-specific antibodies for protection against infection. On the other
  hand, the activation of cytotoxic T cells allows them to target and kill the NiV-infected
  cells.'
