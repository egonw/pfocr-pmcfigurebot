caption: 'Schematic diagram of intracellular long-chain primary fatty alcohol and
  very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthesis pathway. This schematic diagram is based
  on the functional and subcellular location introduction of elongation of ELOVL (UniprotID:
  Q1HRV8) and FAR (UniprotID: Q7ZXF5) in the Uniprot database. The text, chemical
  structure, and abbreviation in the figure are all from the Uniprot database. Both
  the peroxisome and the endoplasmic reticulum are schematic, and their size and scale
  are not drawn according to the actual size and scale of the cells.'
