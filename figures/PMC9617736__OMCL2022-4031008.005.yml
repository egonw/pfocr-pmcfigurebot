caption: Prediction of the PPI target based on molecular docking (A1, A2) Interaction
  between PPI and β-catenin. (B1, B2) Interaction between PPI and p53. (C1, C2) Interaction
  between PPI and PI3K. (D1, D2) Interaction between PPI and AKT. (E1, E2) Interaction
  between PPI and GSK-3β. Residues around the compound are displayed at the surface
  (A1–E1), and the interaction mode is shown in 2D diagrams (A2–E2). PPI is colored
  in cyan.
