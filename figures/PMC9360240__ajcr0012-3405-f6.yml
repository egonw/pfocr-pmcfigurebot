caption: SHMT2 regulates the VEGF signaling pathway in breast cells. Western blotting
  analysis of VEGF and PEDF proteins in MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cells
  with SHMT2 knockdown (A) and overexpression (B). VEGF and PEDF proteins in supernatant
  detected by ELISA in breast cancer cells with SHMT2 knockdown (C) and over-expression
  (D). Subsequently, the ratio of VEGF and PEDF was calculated from ELISA results
  in breast cells with sh-SHMT2 (E). Finally, an angiogenesis experiment was conducted
  in breast cells with sh-SHMT2, and vessel area and length were calculated (F). *P
  < 0.05, Student’s t-test. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three tests.
