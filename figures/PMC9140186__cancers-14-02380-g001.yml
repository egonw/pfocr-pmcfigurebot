caption: 'Targeted analysis of the sphingolipidome reveals decreased ceramides and
  hexosyl-ceramides in tamoxifen-resistant cells. (A) Abundance of different sphingolipid
  species in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7-HER2 and MCF-7-TAM1 cells relative to tamoxifen-sensitive
  parental MCF-7 cells was determined by LC-MS. Relative abundances in log2 scale
  are presented as a heatmap. Relative abundances were calculated by dividing the
  abundance of a certain sphingolipid species by the average abundance of that species
  in MCF-7 cells. (B) Relative abundance of total ceramides (Cer), dihydroceramides
  (DiHCer), hexosylceramides (HexCer), and sphingomyelins (SM) in each tamoxifen-resistant
  cell line were calculated by dividing the abundance of a certain sphingolipid species
  by the average abundance of that species in MCF-7 cells and are presented as fold
  changes in a bar plot. (C) Simplified version of the human sphingolipid pathway
  is presented as a schematic diagram. Key enzymes in the pathway are shown in blue.
