caption: Possible pro-oncogenic effect of tirzepatide (TRZD) on the thyroid gland.
  TRZD via GLP-1R or GIPR activation leads to an increase in the intracellular levels
  of cAMP and protein kinase A activation, which drives the expression and secretion
  of calcitonin. The sustained activation of these receptors and release of calcitonin
  is accompanied by C-cell hyperplasia and transformation into C-cell adenomas and
  MTC. The black arrows indicate the pathway and flow of components involved in the
  pathway. The green upward arrow indicates an increase, while the red downward arrow
  indicates a decrease. Created with Biorender.com (accessed on 13 September 2022).
