caption: Heatmap clustering, KEGG pathway, and PCA analysis for all the RNA-Seq samples.
  (a) The heatmap of the distance matrix obtained with the DESeq2 package on regularized-logarithm
  transformed counts showing an overview of similarities and dissimilarities between
  the RNA-Seq samples. The heatmap shows three distinct groups of cells (YD-8 + YD-8/CIS,
  YD-9 + YD-9/CIS, and YD-38 + YD-38/CIS) and within each group, there were two subgroups
  of cells (cisplatin-resistant cells and parental cells). Red indicates upregulated
  genes and blue indicates downregulated genes (q-value < 0.05). (b) Expression of
  genes in cancer pathways in parental samples and cisplatin-resistant samples. Genes
  in the colored box have significantly different expression. Red indicates upregulated
  genes and blue indicates downregulated genes. (c) PCA plot of the overall gene expression,
  showing the separation of YD-8/CIS and YD-9/CIS cells from other cells. PCA is based
  on the abundances of all transcripts detected in the RNA-Seq analysis. The color
  legend is reported at the bottom of the plot.
