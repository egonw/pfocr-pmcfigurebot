caption: ANKRD49 is highly expressed in LUAD and correlates with poor prognosis. (A)
  Immunohistochemical determination of ANKRD49 in lung adenocarcinoma and its adjacent
  non‐cancerous tissues. Representative images are shown for negative ANKRD49 staining
  in adjacent non‐tumorous tissues (a) and weak ANKRD49 staining (b), moderate ANKRD49
  staining, (b) and strong ANKRD49 staining (d) in tumour tissues. Scale bar is 50 μm.
  (B) Quantitative analysis of immunostaining intensities of ANKRD49 in lung adenocarcinoma
  tissues and their adjacent non‐tumorous tissues using the H‐score method. (C) Clinicopathological
  parameters associated with overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma based on Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves. These parameters include overall survival rate (a), TNM stage (b),
  lymph node metastasis (c), differentiation (d), distant metastasis (e), gender (f),
  age (g), histological grade (h), and tumour size (i). The horizontal axis represents
  overall survival time (months), and the vertical axis represents overall survival
  rate (%)
