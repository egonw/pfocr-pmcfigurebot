caption: 'Inhibition of TLR2 signaling alleviates P. gingivalis-induced SMCs apoptosis
  and reduces miR-143/145 expression. a Influence of different concentrations of P.
  gingivalis on TLR-2 signaling (MYD88, Trif, and IRAK-4 protein expression), apoptosis-related
  markers (PARP, cleaved PARP, and Cleaved caspase3 protein expression), and NF-κB
  pathway (p-P65, P65, and Ikb-α in cytoplasmic extracts, and P65 in nuclear extracts).
  b Influence of inhibiting TLR2 signaling on apoptosis-related markers and NF-κB
  pathway. c Flow cytometry analysis for apoptotic SMCs with the stimulation of P.
  gingivalis and C29 (a TLR2 Inhibitor). d Relative miR-143/145 expression in the
  nucleus, cytoplasm, and apoEVs were measured by qRT-PCR when Pg-infected SMCs were
  treated with C29. e Immunostaining staining of α-SMA and Cleaved caspase3 in atherosclerotic
  lesions from TLR2+/+ApoE−/− or TLR2−/−ApoE−/− mice with P. gingivalis exposure or
  not. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundary between tunica intima and media.
  n = 6. Scale bars: 50 μm. f FISH staining showing the miR-143 (white arrowhead)
  and miR-145 (yellow arrowhead) expression in atherosclerotic plaque of TLR2+/+ApoE−/−
  or TLR2−/−ApoE−/− mice with P. gingivalis exposure or not. n = 6. Scale bars: 20 μm.
  The right panel shows the quantitative data. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparisons tests. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01;
