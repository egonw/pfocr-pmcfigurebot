caption: The additive effect of ICT and HFS on integrin-mediated focal adhesion pathway.
  Cells were treated with ICT (1 µM), HFS (50 µg/mL), or their combination (ICT (1
  µM) + HFS (50 µg/mL)). The cells treated with the vehicle served as controls (CON).
  (A) Representative images of rMSCs spreading. F-actin and cell nuclei were labelled
  with red and blue fluorescent, respectively. (B) mRNA levels of Itga3. Data are
  shown as mean ± SD (** p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD, n = 3). (C) The
  effect of the combination of ICT and HFS on integrin subunits and intercellular
  signalling evaluated by Western Blot.
