caption: The main metabolic changes occurring in the terpenoid pathway in the KT and
  ATMA lines of T. × media hairy roots after elicitation with MeJA. The included picture
  (representative samples of the control and MeJA-treated ATMA root line) shows the
  visible difference between the control and elicited hairy roots.
