caption: Protein interaction network and GSEA of MT1G. (a) An interaction network
  of the MT1G protein with other proteins (MT1H, MT1X, MT1E, MT2A, MT1F, MT1M, APRT,
  SPINK7, GSR, and PLA2G2A). The interaction network was obtained from the STRING
  database. (b) The MT1G upregulated samples were enriched in pathway of “Oxidative
  phosphorylation.” (c) The MT1G upregulated samples were enriched in pathway of “P53
  signaling pathway.” (d) The MT1G upregulated samples were enriched in pathway of
  “Proteasome.” (e) The MT1G upregulated samples were enriched in pathway of “Glutathione
  metabolism.”
