caption: 'GLIPR1 enhanced the invasion of SHC-44 and SW1783 cells by transwell assay,
  and cells were stained with crystal violet. (A) Effect of overexpression or interference
  with GLIPR1 on the invasion of SHC-44 cells. (B) Effect of overexpression or interference
  with GLIPR1 on the invasion of SW1783 cells. Magnification: ×200, scale bar: 100
  µm. (*) represents a significance compared with the Model group. **, P<0.01. NC,
  normal group; Model, model group.'
