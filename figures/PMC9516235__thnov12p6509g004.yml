caption: MCM6 activates PI3K/Akt and focal adhesion signaling in GC. (A) Volcano plot
  showed differentially expressed genes from BGC-823 cells treated with siNC vs. siMCM6
  by RNA-seq analysis (blue for downregulated; red for upregulated). (B) KEGG pathway
  analysis of altered signaling pathway in BGC-823 cells treated with siNC vs. siMCM6.
  (C) FHRE luciferase reporter assayed the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway in GC cells
  with or without MCM6 modulated. (D) Western blot analysis of GC cells with or without
  MCM6 modulated. (E) Western blot analysis of three pairs of GC clinical samples.
  N, adjacent non-tumor; T, tumor. (F-G) Western blot analysis of GC cells with or
  without MCM6 overexpressed upon MK-2206 administration (4 μmol/L) (F, top). Quantification
  of cell viability (F, bottom) and colony formed (G) in GC cells treated as indicated.
  (H1-2) Western blot analysis of GC cells treated as indicated. (I-J) Quantification
  of cell viability (I), migrated or invaded cells (J) in GC cells treated as indicated.
  (K) Immunofluorescence staining of F-actin (green) for the number of filopodia per
  cells. White arrows indicated the filopodia. DAPI (blue) for nuclei. Scale bar,
  10 μm. (L) Pull-down assayed the activity of Cdc42 and Rac1 in GC cells with or
  without MCM6 suppressed. Error bars in C, F, G, I, J and K represent mean ± standard
  deviation. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; analysis of variance test (ANOVA)
  (C, F, G, I, J and K) or 2 tailed t test (C). EV, empty vector; FHRE, forkhead response
  element; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; NC, negative control.
