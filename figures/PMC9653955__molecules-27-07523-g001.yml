caption: (a) Cell viability of HTB75 cells following treatment with the crude extract
  of cannabis strains DQ, GB-11, GB-14, GB-18 and Paris. Cell viability was determined
  by XTT assay as a function of live cell number at 48 h. Control was the vehicle-treated
  control (1.00% v/v methanol). Error bars indicate ± SE (n = 3). Levels with different
  Upper case letters were significantly different from all combinations of pairs according
  to the Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05). (b) Cell viability
  following treatment with C. sativa DQ crude extract at different concentrations
  for IC50 value calculation from 5P logistic curve fit using GraphPad Prism version
  6.1. Concentration 0 was the vehicle-treated control (1.25% v/v methanol). Error
  bars indicate ± SE (n = 3).
