caption: 'Data correlation analysis. (a) Scatterplot matrix indicating correlations
  within the entire data set (all four groups: sun-exposed skin, AK, BD, and SCC).
  Pairwise correlation analyses include the tight junction protein (TJPs) characteristics
  of membrane (Claudin-1-M, Claudin-7-M), cytoplasm (Claudin-1-C, Claudin-7-C), and
  nucleus (Claudin-1-N, Claudin-7-N) and signaling pathway proteins (p-ERK, p-AKT,
  and p-mTOR). Data about different groups is represented by different colors (sun-exposed
  skin, green; AK, yellow; BD, blue; SCC, red). The red line represents the pairwise
  linear regression slope, while the pink shaded clouds represent the 95% bivariate
  normal density ellipse. (b) Heatmap representation for the data set.'
