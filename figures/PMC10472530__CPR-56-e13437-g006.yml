caption: 'Sleep deprivation disturbs ISC proliferation and intestinal epithelial repair.
  (A) Representative immunofluorescence images of sleep deprivation and non‐sleep
  deprivation flies from the R4 or R5 region of the midguts with GFP and Dl staining.
  esg‐GFP (green) was used to visualize ISCs and EBs, and Dl staining (red) identifies
  ISCs. (B) Quantification of pH3+ cell number in the gut of sleep deprivation and
  non‐sleep deprivation flies. Each dot corresponds to one gut. Mean and SD. (C and
  D) Quantification of the ratio of Dl+ cells (C) and esg‐GFP+ cells (D) to DAPI+
  cells in sleep deprivation and non‐sleep deprivation flies. Each dot represents
  one ROI in the R4 or R5 region of the midgut. ROI =3.4 × 104 μm2 area. Mean and
  SD. (E) Representative immunofluorescence images in the guts of BLM‐0D, BLM‐REC‐1D,
  and BLM‐REC‐3D flies with sleep deprivation and non‐sleep deprivation. (F) Quantification
  of the number of pH3+ cells per gut. Each dot corresponds to one gut. Mean and SD.
  (G and H) Quantification of the ratio of Dl+ cells (G) and esg‐GFP+ cells (H) per
  ROI. Each dot corresponds to one ROI. Mean and SD. (I and J) Representative images
  (I) and quantification (J) of the percentage of gut acid–base homeostasis of sleep
  deprivation flies and non‐sleep deprivation flies. The CCR region is indicated by
  a circle. The type of the GI tract of flies fed with Bromophenol blue include ‘Homeostasis’
  (CCR area: yellow) and ‘Perturbed’ (CCR area: blue). Error bars represent the SD
  of three independent experiments. N = 15 flies per group. (K and L) Representative
  images (K) and quantification (L) of fly excretion deposits from sleep deprivation
  flies and non‐sleep deprivation flies fed with Bromophenol Blue. Each sample contains
  three independent experiments. Excretions are quantified for 12 fields in each group
  of 15 flies. Mean and SD. Scale bar = 10 μm. DAPI‐stained nuclei are shown in blue.
  Student''s t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, NS = not significant.'
