caption: 'The gene sets positively correlated with EIF4A1 contribute to cancer cell
  growth and immunity suppression. The GSVA score of the gene set positively correlated
  with EIF4A1, sub-grouped by normal and tumor tissues (A) and clinical stages (B).
  The survival associations using different outcome indicators in high- or low-GSVA
  score patients of LUAD (C). KEGG pathway of the gene set positively correlated with
  EIF4A1 (D). Pathway analysis of the gene set positively correlated with EIF4A1 in
  the canonical pathway (E) and disease and function (F), as assessed via IPA. The
  correlation of immune cell infiltration with the GSVA score of the gene set positively
  correlated with EIF4A1 (G). ****: p < 0.001.'
