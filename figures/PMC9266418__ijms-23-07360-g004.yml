caption: Transcription levels of (A) estrogen receptor α (ESR1), (B) estrogen receptor
  ß (ESR2), and (C) progesterone receptor (PGR) in the mares’ endometria in follicular
  (FLP; n = 50) or mid-luteal (MLP; n = 50) phases of the estrous cycle. The endometrial
  samples classified as control group (C; n = 20) or as inactive nondestructive (E
  IN; n = 20), inactive destructive (E ID; n = 20), active nondestructive (E AN; n
  = 20), or active destructive (E AD; n = 20) types of endometrosis. C group included
  category I (n = 20) samples; type E IN included categories IIa (n = 5), IIb (n =
  11), and III (n = 4) samples; type E ID included categories IIa (n = 10), IIb (n
  = 5), and III (n = 5) samples; type E AN included categories IIa (n = 12), IIb (n
  = 5), and III (n = 3) samples; and type E AD included categories IIa (n = 3), IIb
  (n = 9), and III (n = 8) samples. Boxes represent lower quartile, median, and upper
  quartile, whereas whiskers represent minimum and maximum values. The dashed line
  separates the unaffected endometrium and types of affected endometrium. Lowercase
  letters indicate differences between histopathological types of endometrosis for
  p < 0.05. Asterisks indicate differences between phases of estrous cycle (* p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.0001).
