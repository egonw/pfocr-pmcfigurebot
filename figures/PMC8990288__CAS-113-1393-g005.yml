caption: The role of TRAF6 in HLEC tube formation. (A, C) Western blotting analysis
  of TRAF6 protein expression in SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with pCDH and
  pCDH‐TRAF6, respectively. GAPDH served as a loading control. The relative protein
  expression levels of TRAF6 in SW480 and HCT116 cells were quantified. (B, D) The
  lymphatic tube number (40×) of the pCDH‐TRAF6 cells increased in comparison with
  the pCDH transfected cells (negative control). One representative image from three
  reproducible experiments is shown. The number of lymphatic tubes is shown in the
  bar graph. (E, G) Western blot analysis of TRAF6 expression in SW480 and HCT116
  cells transfected with psuper, pTR1 (psuper‐shTRAF6‐1), and pTR2 (psuper‐shTRAF6‐2),
  respectively. GAPDH served as a loading control. The relative protein expression
  levels of TRAF6 in SW480 and HCT116 cells were quantified. (F, H) The tube number
  of pTR1 and pTR2 transfected cells was significantly reduced by comparison with
  psuper cells (negative control). One representative image from three reproducible
  experiments is shown. The number of lymphatic tubes is shown in the bar graph. Data
  are shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05
