caption: 'PREX2 deficiency promotes cytosolic dsDNA accumulation to activate STING
  signaling. A Volcanic maps showed significant differential genes after RNA-seq screening.
  B GSEA analyses in RNA-seq data. C qRT-PCR detection of the expression levels of
  IFN-I response genes in PREX2 overexpressed RKO cells at 24 h after 4 Gy radiation.
  D Immunofluorescence assay detection of the dsDNA in PREX2 overexpressed RKO cells
  and PREX2-knockdown SW480 cells after 4 Gy radiation. Scale bar: 20 Î¼m. E Immunofluorescence
  assay detection of the dsDNA in PREX2 overexpressed RKO cells treated with or without
  PREX-in1 at 24 h after 4Gy radiation. F Western blot analysis detection of the expression
  of cGAS, STING, TBK1, STAT1, and IRF3 and the phosphorylation of STING, TBK1, STAT1,
  and IRF3 in stable overexpression and interference cell lines with or without 4
  Gy radiation. G Western blot analysis detection of the expression of cGAS, p-STING,
  STING, p-TBK1, TBK1, p-STAT1, STAT1, p-IRF3, and IRF3 in PREX2 overexpressed RKO
  cells treated with or without PREX-in1 at 24 h after 4Gy radiation. *p < 0.05, **p
