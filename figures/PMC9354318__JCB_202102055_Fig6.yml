caption: 'Activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR increases IRF3 activity by upregulated transcription
  in response to Opn. Time course of IRF3 protein and mRNA expression in Ifnar1−/−
  pDCs ≤6 h after frOpn1 or PBS addition (control). (a) Graphs depicting cytoplasmic
  and nuclear IRF3 MFI in 20 pDCs (top) and relative mRNA expression of Irf3 at indicated
  time points, normalized to Hprt expression (bottom). Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 3 wells per group) from three independent experiments containing six
  mice per group. *, P ≤ 0.033; **, P ≤ 0.002; ***, P ≤ 0.001 (two-way ANOVA with
  Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test). (b) Graphical abstract. Ligation of SLAYGLR
  domain of Opn (frOpn1) to α4 integrin enhances IFN-β production: Integrin triggers
  PI3K activation leading to Akt phosphorylation that activates mTOR. Posttranslational
  activation of mTOR signaling pathway and phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase lead to
  enhanced Irf3 mRNA transcription. IRF3 protein is phosphorylated and translocated
  to the nucleus, where it enhances Ifnb gene transcription. Ligation of frOpn1 enhances
  IFN-β+ intratumoral pDC and IFN-γ+CD8+ T cell numbers, consequently inducing reduction
  of melanoma tumor size. Undetermined signaling pathway is represented by a dotted
  line.'
