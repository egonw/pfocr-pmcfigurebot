caption: Glucose uptake and metabolism in brain endothelial cells exposed to PbA-IE.
  Measurement of glucose in supernatants of (A) BECs cultures after 24 h of exposure
  to PbA-IE in the presence or absence of 2-DG (10 mM) and (B) in cultures from wild-type,
  IFNAR1 KO and IFNB KO BECs in presence of 2-DG. (C) Multiple pathway targeted analysis
  showing enrichment ratio (P-value) of metabolic pathways in wild-type BECs exposed
  to PbA-IE as compared to unexposed BECs (MetaboAnalyst 5.0). Significant results
  of pairwise comparisons in ANOVA tests are shown (***; p<0.001, ****; p <0.0001).
