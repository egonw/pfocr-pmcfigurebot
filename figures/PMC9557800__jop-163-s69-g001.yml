caption: The contribution of axonogenesis to chronic overlapping pain conditions based
  on the results from genome-wide association studies and brain imaging data (based
  on Khoury et al). Genome-wide association studies were conducted in human subjects
  reporting chronic pain at a single body site (N = 1 site, blue) or multiple body
  sites (N â‰¥ 2 sites, purple), compared with human subjects not reporting any pain
  (N = 0). The DCC Netrin 1 Receptor (also known as colorectal cancer suppressor)
  gene was found to be strongly associated with multisite chronic pain but not with
  single-site chronic pain. DCC is a gene that critically contributes to axonogenesis,
  the process of steered development of neuronal axons toward their synaptic targets.
  Consistent with the association of DCC gene with chronic multisite pain, the genome-wide
  association study-based pathways analyses identified axonogenesis in brain tissues
  as the major contributing pathway to chronic multisite pain. Genetic partitioned
  heritability (h2) analysis indicated a significant enrichment of heritability in
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms at loci of genes exclusively expressed in brain
  regions for multisite chronic pain but not for single-site chronic pain. Brain imaging
  data identified increased neurite orientation dispersion with an increased number
  of chronic pain sites. The orientation dispersion of neurites can range from highly
  parallel (coherently oriented white matter structures) to highly dispersed (grey
  matter structures characterized by sprawlig dendritic processes in all directions),
  as suggested by the neuronal networks inside the bar plot's bars. Orientation dispersion
  is shown for the uncinate fasciculus brain sub-structure. The background brain image
  shows evidence for DCC expression in the uncinate fasciculus. Together, our results
  suggest that genetically determined DCC-dependent disorganization in axonal tracks
  in patients with chronic overlapping pain conditions may contribute to pathogenesis
  of disease through corticolimbic circuits.
