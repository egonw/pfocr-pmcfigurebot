caption: 'Transcriptional regulation of central metabolism in the trichomes of Cannabis
  cultivars with respect to stem tissue. (a) M-D plot of mean expression values (TMM)
  of genes encoding enzymes involved in the central metabolism (the glycolytic pathway,
  pyruvate metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle).
  Filled orange circles denote differentially up-regulated genes of interest, while
  filled blue circles represent all other genes in the central metabolism. It should
  be noted that PEPC is significantly down-regulated. (b) Pathway diagram of the central
  metabolism with corresponding enzyme names marked in red/orange. Note that ICL had
  very low expression. (c) Similar diagram for NAD(P)H replenishment pathway. Refer
  to  for corresponding gene IDs of enzymes. Enzyme abbreviations in numeric and alphabetical
  order: ACAT1 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase cytosolic 1); ALDH2C4 (aldehyde dehydrogenase
  family 2 member C4, NADH producing [-like]); ALDH3F1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase family
  3 member F1, NADH producing); ALDO6 (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 6, cytosolic);
  ALDO5 (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 5, cytosolic); CS (ATP-citrate synthase);
  GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase); GAPN (NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase); GPI-like (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, chloroplastic-like); ICL
  (isocitrate lyase); ME (NADP+) (NADP-dependent malic enzyme); MS (malate synthase,
  glyoxysomal); PDC1-like (pyruvate decarboxylase 1-like); PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  chloroplastic); PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, housekeeping isozyme); PGK
  (phosphoglycerate kinase); PK (pyruvate kinase, cytosolic); PK2 (plastidial pyruvate
  kinase 2). Metabolite abbreviations in numeric and alphabetical order: 3PG (3-phosphoglyceric
  acid); AcCoA (Acetyl co-enzyme A); AcAcCoA (Acetoacetyl CoA); AcDH (Acetaldehyde);
  Acet (acetate); ADP (adenosine diphosphate); ATP (adenosine triphosphate); citrate
  (Cit); CoA (coenzyme A); DXP (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate); F6p (fructose-6-phosphate);
  Fbp (Fructose bisphosphatase); G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate); G6p (Glucose-6-phosphate);
  Glc (glucose); Glyo (glyolate); iCit (isocitrate); Mal (S-malate); NAD+ (Nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide); NADH (reduced NAD); NADP+ (NAD phosphate); NADPH (reduced
  NAD phosphate); OAA (oxaloacetate); PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate); Pyr (pyruvate).'
