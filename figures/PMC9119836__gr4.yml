caption: The regulatory effect of IPO7 on the ERBB pathway. (A) GSEA showed that ERBB
  signal pathway was related with IPO7 in PC. (Bâ€’C) qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed
  that ERBB2 expression was up-regulated in pcDNA-IPO7 group and down-regulated in
  IPO7-siRNA#1 and IPO7-siRNA#2 group. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate
  (*p < 0.05).
