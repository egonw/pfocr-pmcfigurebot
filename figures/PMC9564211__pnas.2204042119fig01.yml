caption: Chromosome dynamics during early sporulation. (A) Schematic representation
  of the changes to chromosome segregation during early sporulation. Chromosome origins
  (blue circles) become anchored to opposite cell poles while the terminus region
  (red circles) remain associated at midcell. This is followed by asymmetric division
  that defines the small prespore and large mother cell. SpoIIIE (green circles) resides
  in the asymmetric septum to prevent DNA scission and pump the mother cell localized
  portion of the bisected chromosome into the prespore. (B) Schematic showing the
  major features of the origin region required for anchoring of the chromosome to
  the cell poles during sporulation. There are two redundant pathways involved in
  capturing the origin. The first is the sporulation-specific RacA pathway, which
  is centered around ram sites (black arrows) to the left of oriC. The second pathway
  is centered around parS at oriC (red arrows). Spo0J binds parS, and along with Soj
  and a complex of polar proteins, tethers the origin region to the pole. (C) The
  Soj ATPase cycle. Upon binding to ATP, empty (Apo) Soj monomers structurally rearrange
  to form ATP-Soj. ATP-Soj can dimerize, which facilitates nonspecific DNA binding.
  Interactions between DNA-bound Soj dimers and Spo0J (bound around parS sites) trigger
  the ATPase activity of Soj, release from DNA, and a structural reversion back to
  the Apo form. The mutations K16A and G12V lock Soj in the Apo or ATP forms, respectively.
