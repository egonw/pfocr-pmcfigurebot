caption: 'Effects of CypA/MMP9 pathway on anesthesia/surgery-induced delirium-like
  behavior in mice. Inhibition of CypA/MMP9 pathway improves anesthesia/surgery-induced
  delirium-like behavior. In the buried food test, CsA decreased the latency to eat
  food in mice (A). In the open field test, anesthesia/surgery had no influence on
  total distance (B), time spent in the center (D) or freezing time (E). CsA decreased
  the latency to center (C) in mice. In the Y maze test, CsA increased the duration
  in novel arm (F) and the percentage of novel arm visits (G) in mice with delirium-like
  behavior, which is induced by anesthesia/surgery. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM
  and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc
  test. The control and A/S groups are shared between . n = 10 per group. A/S, anesthesia/surgery.
  *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, compared to control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P
  < 0.001, compared to A/S group.'
