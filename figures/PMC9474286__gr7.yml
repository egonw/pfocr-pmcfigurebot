caption: Monitoring of extra- and intracellular lignan metabolite titers over time
  of strain ER_CueO. A pointed-dashed line indicates the time of induction as well
  as the addition of coniferyl alcohol and CuSO4. (A) CDW (orange circles) and glucose
  consumption (black squares). (B) Extra- (blue squares) and intracellular (grey circles)
  coniferyl alcohol and â€“ aldehyde titers over time. (C) Extra- (blue squares) and
  intracellular (grey circles) lignan titers over time. The numbering of metabolites
  corresponds to . (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
