caption: MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain interacts with diverse effectors of the CSC state.
  The MUC1-C CD (72 aa) is an intrinsically disordered protein that functions as a
  node in integrating multiple signaling pathways that promote the CSC state. MUC1-CD
  includes a CQC motif that is (i) a sensor of increases in ROS, (ii) necessary for
  the formation of MUC1-C homodimers and (iii) a target for the GO-203 inhibitor.
  The MUC1-CD CQC motif confers binding to MYC. Shown are tyrosine phosphorylation
  sites that function as motifs for interactions with PI3K (pYHPM) and GRB2 (pYTNP)
  in activating the AKT and ERK pathways, respectively. Also shown are potential consensus
  SH2 binding motifs for interactions with SHC (pYPTY) and PLCγ1 (pYVPP). In addition,
  MUC1-CD interacts directly with proinflammatory TFs, such as NF-κB and STAT3, and
  the WNT pathway effectors, β-catenin and TCF4, that are associated with driving
  the CSC state. Highlighted is the SAGNGGSSLS or SER-rich motif (SRM) that functions
  as a binding region for STAT3, β-catenin and TCF4. Figure modified from [,].
