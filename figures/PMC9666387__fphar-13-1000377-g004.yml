caption: 'Sodium cantharidate (SCA) induces autophagy in breast cancer cells. (A)
  Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the effect of SCA on the
  submicroscopic structural morphology of breast cancer cells. (B) Fluorescence microscopy
  images of CYTO-ID staining in breast cancer cells after SCA treatment for 24 h (400×),
  scale bar: 2 µm. (C) Western blot analysis of the levels of autophagy-related proteins
  in breast cancer cells after SCA treatment for 24 h. Data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared with the control group).'
