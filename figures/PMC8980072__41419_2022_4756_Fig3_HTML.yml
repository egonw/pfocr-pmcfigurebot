figure_title: Overexpression of PARD6A promotes EMT of ovarian cancer cells in vitro
caption: A, B PARD6A was successfully overexpressed in HO8910 and OVCAR8 cells. A
  Protein lysates of HO8910 and OVCAR8 cells with PARD6A overexpression were subjected
  to immunobloting with the PAR6α antibody and β-actin was used as an internal control.
  B Relative mRNA expression of PARD6A in HO8910 and OVCAR8 cells with PARD6A overexpression
  assessed by qRT-PCR. Representative images and statistical analysis of wound-healing
  assays on HO8910 (C) and OVCAR8 cells (D), which were overexpressed with PARD6A,
  at the indicated time. Scale bar = 500 µm. Representative images and statistical
  analysis of transwell migration and invasion assays on HO8910 (E) and OVCAR8 cells
  (F), which were overexpressed with PARD6A. Scale bar = 200 µm. Data shown in B–E
  are the mean values (±SD) from three independent experiments. Statistically significant
  differences with P < 0.05 were considered significant (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
