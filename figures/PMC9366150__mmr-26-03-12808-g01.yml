caption: Inhibition of miR-98-5p ameliorates HG-induced osteoblast injury. (A) Expression
  of miR-98-5p was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR after transfection
  with a miR-98-5p inhibitor. (B) Expression of miR-98-5p after miR-98-5p inhibitor
  transfection in HG-induced osteoblasts. (C) Viability of HG-induced osteoblasts
  after transfection with the miR-98-5p inhibitor. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. MC3T3-E1 (Dif), MC3T3-E1 cells that were cultured in
  a differentiation medium for 14 days. miR, microRNA; HG, high glucose; NC, negative
  control.
article_title: Inhibition of miR-98-5p promotes high glucose-induced suppression of
  preosteoblast proliferation and differentiation via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  signaling pathway by targeting BMP2.
