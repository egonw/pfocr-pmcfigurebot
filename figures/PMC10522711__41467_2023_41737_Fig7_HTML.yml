figure_title: Combination treatment with α-PD-1 and PARP14 inhibition induces an inflammatory
  response
caption: A GSEA based on RNA-seq data depicting hallmark processes enriched in chronic
  IFNγ pre-treated tumours treated with α-PD-1 alone (n = 4) versus Control (n = 4);
  combined αPD-1 and PARP14 inhibition (Combo) (n = 4) versus α-PD-1 alone (n = 4);
  Combo (n = 4) versus Control (n = 4). Circle area depicts the NES, and colour intensity
  depicts the FDR, with ≤0.25 classed as significant. B–C Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) was performed to identify up- or down-regulation of B upstream regulators
  and C disease-related or functional pathways in tumours receiving α-PD-1/PARP14i
  combination treatment (n = 4) versus α-PD-1 alone treatment (n = 4). Results were
  displayed with their P-value (-log(P-value)) and activation z-score. The p-values
  were assessed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. D–L Bulk-tumour RNA-seq results treated
  with Control (n = 4); PD-1 + Vehicle (n = 4); or PD-1 + PARP14i (n = 4) analysed
  by cell-type enrichment analysis (ImmuCellAI), with scores shown for D infiltration,
  E T cell, F M1 macrophage, G CD8 central memory (CM) T cells, H CD8 effector memory
  (EM) T cells, I exhausted (Ex) CD8 T cells, J Granulocytes, K Myeloid Dendritic
  cell (MoDC), L CD8 cytotoxic T cell (Tc). The data were presented as mean ± S.E.M.
  and the adjusted p-values were determined by one-way ANOVA Tukey’s test. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
