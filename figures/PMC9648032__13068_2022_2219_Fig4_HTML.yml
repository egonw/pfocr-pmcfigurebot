caption: Rebalancing carbon flux through the PPP and EDP for enhanced 3-HP production.
  a A diagram for genetic strategy for the efficient production of 3-HP. A heterologous
  3-HP synthetic pathway was introduced by expressing two dissected subparts, N-terminus
  and C-terminus ones, from the mutant malonyl-CoA reductase gene (mcr) derived from
  C. aurantiacus. ACC was overexpressed for malonyl-CoA accumulation while fatty acid
  synthesis was reduced by expressing a temperature-sensitive FabI at 37 °C. b 3-HP
  production titer at 48 h post-induction. Error bars indicate standard deviations
  of 3-HP titer for three independent biological replicates, respectively
