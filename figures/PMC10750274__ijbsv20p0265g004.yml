caption: EXOSC5 increases CSCs activity via NTN4/integrin β1 pathway. (A) Levels of
  secreted NTN4 from conditional medium (CM) of EXOSC5-knockdown EC cells (shE5#1
  or shE5#2) were detected by Western blot. WCL stands for whole cell lysate. (B,
  C) The effect of recombinant NTN4 (rNTN4) on CSC activity in AN3CA cells was assessed
  using a tumorsphere assay. Representative images of primary and secondary tumorspheres
  are shown in (B). Tumorsphere count quantification is presented in (C) with data
  shown as mean ± SD. Scale bars represent 100µm. *, p< 0.05 as determined by Student's
  t-test. (D, E) The influence of rNTN4 on CSC activity in EXOSC5-knockdown AN3CA
  cells was evaluated through a tumorsphere assay. Representative images of tumorspheres
  are shown in (D). Quantification data is presented in (E) as mean ± SD. **, p< 0.01
  by Student's t-test. Scale bars indicated 100µm in length. (F-G) Heatmaps showcasing
  gene expression associated with the integrin signal (F) and focal adhesion (G) in
  EXOSC5-knockdown HEC1A cells compared to shLacZ-transduced cells were presented.
  (H-I) Whole cell lysates from AN3CA cells, treated with 150ng/ml rhNTN4 for 1 hour,
  were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-His (H) or anti-ITGB1 (I) antibodies.
  Western blot analysis was used to detect rhNTN4 and integrin β1 in the precipitated
  proteins. (J) AN3CA cells, treated with 150 ng/ml rhNTN4 for 1 hour, were fixed
  and subjected to immunofluorescent staining with anti-His and anti-ITGB1 antibodies.
  White arrows in the magnified images point to colocalized signals. (K) AN3CA cells,
  treated with 50 ng/ml rNTN4 in the presence or absence of the anti-CD29 neutralization
  antibody, had their CSC activity assessed using a tumorsphere assay. Representative
  tumorsphere images are displayed on the left, and quantification data is on the
  right, presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance is indicated as *, p< 0.05;
  **, p< 0.01; ***, p< 0.001, determined by Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test.
