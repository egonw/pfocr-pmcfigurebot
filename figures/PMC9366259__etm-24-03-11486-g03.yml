caption: 'Regulatory role of ropivacaine in immune response and oxidative stress by
  NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling. (A) The expression of proteins in the NLRP3/Caspase-1
  signaling pathway in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells treated with ropivacaine was assessed
  by western blot analysis. (B) Cell viability, (C) oxidative stress (scale bar, 50
  µm) and (D) inflammation in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells treated with MSU. ***P<0.001
  vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. PM2.5. NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain
  containing 3; MSU, monosodium urate; PM2.5, particulate matter with a diameter of
  ≤2.5 µm.'
