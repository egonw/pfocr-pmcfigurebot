caption: FOLFOX-HT29 and FOLFOX-HCT116 cell lines are much more sensitive than normal
  colonic epithelial cell lines (FHC) to NSC49L and TRAIL treatmentCells were grown
  in 96-well plates and treated for 72 h with different concentrations of NSC49L and
  TRAIL either alone or in combination. Survival of cells was determined by the MTT-assay.(A)
  IC50 of TRAIL.(B–F) IC50 of NSC49L either alone or in the presence of TRAIL in different
  CRC cell lines. Data are the mean ± SE of four estimations.
