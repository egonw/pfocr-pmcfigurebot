caption: In the discovery stage, plasma protein level was measured using SomaScan
  v4.1 7K (7,055 proteins passed QC) on 332 COVID-19 cases, including 82 patients
  on ventilation and 63 patients died from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 150 healthy controls
  recruited at Washington University in St Louis (WUSTL). Differential abundance analyses
  for infection, ventilation and death were performed. The publicly available Massachusetts
  General Hospital (MGH) COVID-19 cohort that includes 4,301 proteins for 297 cases
  and 76 controls were then used for replication. The replicated proteins were defined
  by the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in discovery and replication
  stage, P < 1.16×10−5 in meta-analysis and the concordant direction of effect sizes.
  There were 841 proteins associated with infection, 833 proteins with ventilation
  and 253 with death, which were used to build and validate prediction models and
  perform pathway enrichment analyses. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed
  using publicly available plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of these
  differential abundant proteins and COVID-19 host genetics initiative (HGI) GWAS
  summary statistics to identify the causal proteins. For the MR nominated proteins,
  the genetic region harboring the shared causal variants that driving the causal
  relationship among them were further tested for Bayesian co-localization analyses.
  The proteomic data for the discovery cohort be interactively explored in our web
  portal (www.omics.wustl.edu/proteomics
