caption: Influences of mutant and WT-TP53 on mitochondrial activity and glucose metabolism
  and effects of rapamycin and metformin. The effects of WT and mutant TP53 on key
  enzymes important in glycolysis and how they can influence metabolism and PDAC tumor
  growth. In our studies, we have examined the effect of GOF mutant TP53 and in some
  cases WT TP53. In addition, sites of interaction of the type 2 diabetes drug metformin
  and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and their effects on AMPK and mTORC1 are
  indicated. TP53 can induce mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by regulating the expression
  of PUMA and other proteins.

  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
