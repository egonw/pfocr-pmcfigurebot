caption: The relative expression level of genes involved in Toll pathway in D. citri.
  Dorsal related immunity factor/Dorsal (Dif/DI), Pelle (pll), Tube (tub), Cactus
  (cact), Toll (TI), Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88), and Spaetzle (spz)
  genes expression in different developmental stages of D. citri. Expression of each
  gene is presented with an overlapping boxplot, violin plot, and scatter plot. In
  the boxplot, whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values, horizontal thick
  lines in the middle of the box shows the median, and boxes show the middle 50% of
  scores (i.e., the range between the 25th and 75th percentile, interquartile ranges
  (IQR)). Differences between developmental stages were statistically evaluated for
  each gene by the one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Turkey HSD (p < 0.05).
