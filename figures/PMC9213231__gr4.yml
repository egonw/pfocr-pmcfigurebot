caption: Biosynthesis of itaconic acid (ITA) for the dynamic regulation of metabolic
  flux by the CRISPRi-mediated self-inducible system (CiMS). (A) Construction of different
  sgRNAs targeted to essential genes to interfere with the metabolic pathway. CSl
  (CAD-SH3lig), GPS (GA-PDZ-SH3), and APl (ACN-PDZlig) represent the over-expression
  cascade reaction for ITA production. The genes marked with blue and red represent
  the genes knocked out in the genome of Δ4-Prmd-SAS-3. The genes marked with a pink
  color represent the target genes repressed by the CiMS. After accumulating sufficient
  ITA, the ITA-bound YpItcR could activate the expression of dCas9 and inhibit the
  expression of the genes in pink with the help of the sgRNA. (B) Relative ITA yield
  of the CiMS-regulated strains with different sgRNAs. Escherichia coli MG1655 Δ4-Prmd-SAS-3/sgRNA-0
  was used as the control. The sgRNA-array contained five sgRNAs, sgRNA-icd-1, sgRNA-icd-2,
  sgRNA-pykA-1, sgRNA-sucCD-1, sgRNA-sucCD-2, the inhibition of which could significantly
  improve the production of ITA. Error bars show the standard deviation from three
  independent experiments.
