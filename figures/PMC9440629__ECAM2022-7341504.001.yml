caption: 'TILRR is upregulated to suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis
  of HPMVECs in sepsis-induced ALI. (a) The mRNA level and protein level of TILRR
  in HPMVECs treated with LPS and siTILRR. (b) The proliferation rate of HPMVECs treated
  with LPS and siTILRR. (c) Representative images of flow cytometric apoptosis assay
  in HPMVECs treated with LPS and siTILRR. The bar graph indicated the percentage
  of apoptotic cells in each group. (d) Cell cycle of HPMVECs treated with LPS and
  siTILRR detected using the flow cytometer. LPS: lipopolysaccharide; siTILRR: TILRR
  siRNA; siNC: nontargeting siRNA. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
