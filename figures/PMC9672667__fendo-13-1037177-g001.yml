caption: (A) Domain structure of SHRs. i) Basic domain structure of SHRs is composed
  of an unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) that contains the Activation Function
  1 (AF-1) surface, a zinc finger DNA-binding domain (DBD), a flexible hinge region,
  and a LBD that binds to ligands and interacts with co-regulator proteins through
  the Activation Function 2 (AF-2) surface. ii) Domain size and amino acid length
  of different members of the SHRs sub-family. The DBD and LBDs are the most conserved
  regions whereas the other domains are more variable in length and sequence composition.
  (B) Mechanisms of action of SHRs. Individual action i) The canonical pathway is
  shown. Steroid hormone binding to the steroid hormone receptor (SHR), often in the
  cytoplasm, causes the receptor to undergo a conformational change and translocate
  to the nucleus, where it interacts with specific DNA sequences to regulate transcription
  of target genes. ii) Distribution of SHRs in liquid condensates or foci in the nucleus
  [Reviewed in ()]. iii) Steroid hormone receptor could form multimers or quaternary
  structure after DNA binding (, ). Interesting, this mechanism brings together regions
  that may be distant in the linear genome. Crosstalk between SHRs. iv) The SHRs co-recruitment
  to DNA response elements occurs in presence of both ligands. As a result, this crosstalk
  triggers a specific gene program. SHRs= ERα/PR (); SHRs= GR/PR (); SHRs= ERα/GR
  (). v) Redirection mechanism in which the presence of R5050 in GC-free medium leads
  to the binding of GR to REL and FHOX1 motifs and repress the expression genes required
  for PR function (). On one hand, it has been described that R5020 can directly activate
  and could drive GR binding () but R5020 activated PR could also participate indirectly
  stabilizing REL and/or FOXH1, increasing GR binding. This possibility, although
  feasible, requires further investigation.
