caption: Timeline depicting genomic biomarker-driven drug approvals in skin cancer.
  Except for Imatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of the KIT tyrosine kinase, and
  Levantinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  receptors, which are currently tested in clinical trials for their efficiency when
  combined with ICIs, all the other drugs have gained FDA approval for use in the
  clinical setting in skin cancer patients. CTLA-4- Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen
  4; ICIs- immune checkpoint inhibitors; HH pathway- Hedgehog signaling pathway; SMO-
  Smoothened, Frizzled Class Receptor; MEK pathway- Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase pathway; PD-1 receptor- Programmed cell death protein 1; EGFR- Epidermal
  growth factor receptor; VEGF- Vascular endothelial growth factor; KIT- KIT Proto-Oncogene,
  Receptor Tyrosine Kinase.
