caption: 'Correlation of MYB-NFIB fusion expression with gene enrichment associated
  in interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. (A), Reactome pathway enrichment analysis
  of 215 annotated genes (FDR < 0.05) found in the MYBwt versus MYB-NFIB fusion differential
  gene expression analysis. The x-axis indicates the proportion of genes from this
  set contained in each pathwayâ€™s gene set. Twenty-two IFN pathway-associated genes
  were found in all. (B), Heat-map representation of the normalized and centered gene
  expression data of the 22 IFN signaling pathway-associated genes. Samples and genes
  were ordered using the hierarchical clustering with complete linkage of their Euclidean
  distances. Note: one MYBwt sample was excluded from the overall analysis because
  its RNA sequencing read counts were too low to be included in the HiSeq4000 input.
  (C), Validation of the upregulated genes by qPCR. RNA extracted from parental control,
  MYBwt or MYB-NFIB fusion cells incubated in dox-media for 24 h were analyzed for
  the expression of the various gene targets. (D), qPCR analysis of the target genes
  in HACC-2A cells expressing MYBwt or MYB-NFIB fusion. (E), RNA extracted from the
  indicated ACCXs were evaluated for the expression of representative gene targets
  as shown.'
