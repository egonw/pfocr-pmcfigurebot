caption: DNA replication, cell-cycle, and DNA damage response are among the top negatively
  selected pathways in screen. (A) The number of genes negatively selected at days
  4, 11, and 18 in Srsf2P95H/+ (pink) and Srsf2+/+ (blue) cells. The top 5 negatively
  selected genes for Srsf2P95H/+ cells ranked by β score of all 3 cell lines at each
  timepoint are listed. FDR < 0.01, β score <−1, and any CEG2 essential genes are
  excluded. (B) Pathway analysis of the negatively selected genes for Srsf2+/+ and
  Srsf2P95H/+ at 3 timepoints showing DNA replication, cell-cycle, and DNA damage
  response pathways have a more negative effect on Srsf2P95H/+ cell survival when
  perturbed.

  lethal pathway with SRSF2P95H mutation.
