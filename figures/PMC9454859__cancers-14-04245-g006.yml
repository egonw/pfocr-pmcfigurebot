caption: 'The AhR antagonist CH-223191 interferes with proliferation, Akt pathway
  activity and SCD1 expression in colon carcinoma cells. (A) Cells were treated with
  CH-223191 (10 μM), 24 h after their seeding, and cell numbers were determined after
  48 h treatment. The data are shown as means + SD of at least three independent experiments.
  * denotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between CH-223191-treated and control
  cells. (B,C) HCT116 cells were pre-treated with CH-223191 (10 μM) for 48 h and then
  with insulin (100 nM) for 1 h. The levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt; Ser473) and
  total Akt were determined by Western blotting, with β-actin being used as loading
  control. Representative Western blot images are shown in (B). For original blots,
  see ; the results of densitometry analysis, normalized to β-actin are shown in (C).
  The data are shown as means + SD of at least three independent experiments. * and
  ** denote a significant difference (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) between
  insulin-treated and the respective control cells. # denotes a significant difference
  (p < 0.05) between control wild-type cells treated with insulin and insulin treated
  AhR KO cells or insulin-treated wild-type cells pre-treated with CH-223191. (D)
  SCD1 mRNA levels were determined in control HT-29 and HCT116 cells, and in cells
  treated with CH-223191 (10 μM) for 24 h, by RT-qPCR. The data are shown as means
  + SD of at least three independent experiments. * denotes a significant difference
  (p < 0.05) between control and CH-223191-treated cells. (E) Expression of FA synthesis/transport
  genes in WT (line) and AhR KO differentiated HepaRG cells (black bars). The data
  are shown as means + SD of at least three independent experiments. * denotes a significant
  difference (p < 0.05) between WT and AhR KO cells.'
