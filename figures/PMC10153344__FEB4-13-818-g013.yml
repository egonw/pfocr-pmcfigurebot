caption: The expression of p53 protein in hUCN1‐stimulated Hela cells by western blotting.
  A significant decrease in p53 expression was detected in the presence of 10 nm hUCN1
  for the indicated time points (5 min to 6 h), then the signal intensity rose to
  around baseline. The beta‐actin signal served as loading control. Relative p53 protein
  level was determined by the p53/beta‐actin ratio. The values shown are presented
  by box + whiskers plots, indicating median (central horizontal line), min/max values,
  and mean (with ‘+’ within the box) of four independently performed experiments (n = 4).
  *P < 0.05 vs. Control (one‐way ANOVA, Dunnett).
