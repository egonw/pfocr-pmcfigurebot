caption: 'Proteomic profiling of RBCs from Lesch–Nyhan subjects. (A) Unsupervised
  principal component analysis demonstrates overlapping phenotypes in carrier and
  control RBCs. (B) Partial least squares-discriminant analysis illustrates the clustering
  of biological groups and the intermediate phenotype of the carrier RBCs. (C) Global
  proteomics results as visualized via heat map with hierarchical clustering of the
  top 50 proteins by p-value (one-way ANOVA). (D) Schematic of post-translational
  modifications (PTMs) investigated as readouts for proteome oxidation, including
  cysteine oxidation, asparagine deamidiation, and methylation of glutamate and aspartate.
  (E) Irreversibly oxidized protein cysteine (sulfinic acid and dehydroalanine) content
  as a function of total protein levels. Levels are presented relative to control
  RBCs (dashed line at x = 1). (F) Methylation of protein glutamate and aspartate
  as a function of total protein levels. Levels are presented relative to control
  RBCs (dashed line at x = 1). (G) Asparagine deamidation with subsequent aspartate
  methylation catalyzed by PIMT1 and other methylating enzymes. Levels are presented
  relative to control RBCs (dashed line at x = 1). (H) Network analysis of protein-protein
  and protein-metabolite interactions. Labeled note color denotes metabolic pathway:
  green—nucleotides, blue—amino acids, purple—energy metabolism, red—redox metabolism.
  (I) Pathway analysis of integrated proteomics and metabolomics data. Abbreviations
