figure_title: COL18A1-AS1 regulated the expression of KLF12 through competitively
  binding with miR-1286 in ccRCC
caption: 'A A Venn diagram of three independent miRNA prediction analysis. Blue: DIANA
  database. Orange: TARGETSCAN database. Green: miRDB database. B qRT-PCR results
  of expression level of candidate mRNAs in 786-O and CAKI-1 cells transfected with
  miR-1286 MIMICS or inhibitor. C Luciferase reporter assays detected the luciferase
  activity of KLF12 3''UTR-WT or KLF12 3''UTR-Mut under miR-1286 MIMICS in CAKI-1
  and 786-O cells. D Positive correlation between COL18A1-AS1 and KLF12 expression
  in ccRCC tissues from TCGA database. E Western blotting analysis of KLF12 protein
  in CAKI-1 and OS-RC-2 cells co-transfected with COL18A1-AS1 vector and/or miR-1286
  MIMICS. F Representative FISH and IF images showed the expression level of COL18A1-AS1
  (red) and KLF12 (green) in 786-O cells. Cell nuclear appear in blue (DAPI). Scale
  bars, 10 μm. G The expression level of KLF12 in normal renal and ccRCC tissues from
  TCGA database (unpaired or paired). H qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays showed
  the expression level of KLF12 in ccRCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. I IHC
  for KLF12 in ccRCC tissues and paired normal tissues. Scale bars, 100 μm. J The
  Kaplan–Meier curve of KLF12 in ccRCC for disease-free survival. K qRT-PCR and Western
  blotting assays showed the expression level of KLF12 in RCC cell lines (ACHN, A498,
  CAKI-1, OS-RC-2 and 786-O) and normal cell line (HK-2). L GSEA for the correlations
  between the thermogenesis and fat cell differentiation signaling pathway in ccRCC
  with the levels of the KLF12 mRNA, according to GEO database (GSE53757). FDR < 0.25
  and P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001. Error bars indicate mean ± SD. All the experiments were performed
  in triplicate.'
