figure_title: TgRPI depletion alters the global proteomic profile
caption: (A), Volcano plots showing the protein expression difference based on 4D
  label-free quantitative proteomic data of Δrpi mutants. The X-axis shows log2 (1.5-fold
  change) versus the TgRPI-cKD, and the Y-axis shows -log10 (P value) after ANOVA
  statistical test for n = 4 independent biological replicates. (B), Putative subcellular
  localization of differentially expressed proteins. (C), Enrichment and clustering
  analysis of the quantitative proteomics data sets based on gene ontology, only proteins
  that changed ≥1.5-fold in relative ratios (P<0.05) were considered. BP, biological
  process; CC, cellular component. (D-E), Heat map of differentially expressed ribosomal
  proteins, microneme proteins, rhoptry proteins and stage-specific proteins. Bright
  red indicates a 1.5-fold change (P<0.05). White indicates no change. (F), Four genes
  were selected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis, which examined their expression
  changes. The β-tubulin gene in parasites was used as an internal reference. Means
  ± SEM of three independent assays, *, p <0 .05, ***, P<0.001; Student’s t-test.
