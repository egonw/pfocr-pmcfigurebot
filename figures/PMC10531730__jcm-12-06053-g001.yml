caption: The BCAA catabolic and metabolic complex pathway regulates energy metabolism.
  Increased levels of BCAAs and fatty acids can interfere with normal insulin signaling
  through various mechanisms and ultimately lead to IR. In glycolysis and the Krebs
  cycle, NAD+ is reduced to form the NADH molecule. If NAD+ is not present, glycolysis
  will not be able to continue. IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1); GLUT4 (glucose
  transporter type 4); SREBP (Sterol regulatory element binding proteins); Ras homolog
  enriched in brain (RHEB).
