figure_title: Functional mapping of interactors identified by the epiHSP70s bait
caption: a, b PPI mapping (a) and functional annotation (b, Reactome pathway mapping)
  of the interactors identified by the YK5-B probe in MDA-MB-468 cells. Proteins graded
  as in Fig.  are shown. The location of select epiHSP70s components (HSP70s, HSP90s
  and HOP) and interactors (STAT3, NuMA, PLK1, Aurora A) is also shown in (a). c Reactome
  pathway enrichment analysis detailing the functional annotation of Grade A proteins
  mapped as in (a). Probe was added to live cells for capture, see Fig. . d Proteome-wide
  functional changes (analysed by Reactome pathway mapping) induced by pharmacologic
  or genetic epiHSP70 inhibition in MDA-MB-468 cells, as indicated. e Validation of
  select proteins and protein pathways identified in panels (c, d). See Figs. – for
  detailed validation with focus on Cell cycle. Gel images are representative of three
  independent experiments. Source data are provided as Source data and Supplementary
  Data files.
