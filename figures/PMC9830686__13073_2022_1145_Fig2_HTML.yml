caption: Shared features of human and experimental DN. a Heatmap displaying the Pearson
  correlation coefficient between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data. b Overview of significant
  glomerular DEGs detected in both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets, as well
  as in the ERCB patient dataset. cHeatmap showing the significant regulation of DEGs
  identified in microdissected glomeruli and in glomerular cells from DN patients
  and mice, respectively. Nonsignificant genes are shown in grey. ERCB, European Renal
