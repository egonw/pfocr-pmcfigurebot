caption: 'CVB inhibits the expression of Snail and the activation of the AKT/STAT3/MAPK
  signalling pathway. (A) CVB treatment (0-60 μM, 48 h) resulted in a dose-dependent
  reduction in the EMT regulatory factor Snail. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) Immunofluorescence
  results of Snail after CVB treatment (20 μM, 48 h) in 786-O cells. Scale bar: 200
  μm. (C) After CVB treatment (0-60 μM, 48 h), the expression levels of signalling
  pathway proteins (the phosphorylated and total proteins of AKT, STAT3, JNK, P38,
  and ERK) were analysed by Western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.01 vs. control group.'
