caption: GS downregulates HMGB1 expression via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. U266
  cells were incubated with GS for 48 h and cell supernatant was collected and measured
  for (A) levels of HMGB1 using ELISA. The graph displays the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. 50 µg of proteins from (B) U266 and (C) RPMI
  8226 cells were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and probed against HMGB1 and β-actin. (D)
  U266 cells were transfected with either control (100 pM) or STAT3 specific siRNA
  (50 or 100 pM) and protein expression of STAT3, HMGB1, cleaved-caspase-8 and HSP60
  was determined. (E) Cell viability was also determined using a live/dead cytotoxicity
  kit (Scale bar, 200 μm). (F) U266 cells were treated with 50 µM GS, 50 µM of AG-490
  and 10 µM Stattic for 48 h. A total of 50 µg of proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE
  and protein expression of HMGB1, p-H2AX and β-actin were determined. Full Western
  blot images can be found at .
