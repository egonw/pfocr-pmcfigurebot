caption: High-expression levels of LSD1 and G9a are associated with poor outcome in
  patients with ESCC. (a) Summary of LSD1 and G9a mRNA in healthy tissues and tumor
  tissues obtained from patients with esophageal cancer. (b, c) Representative images
  (b) and staining score distribution (c) of the indicated tissues immunostained for
  LSD1 and G9a. (d) Correlation analysis between LSD1 and G9a protein levels in ESCC
  tissues; the corresponding p value and Pearson's correlation coefficient are shown.
  (e) Representative images of LSD1-stained sections of ESCC samples at the indicated
  T stage. (f) Representative images of G9a-stained and Ki67-stained sections of ESCC
  samples with the indicated tumor grade. (g–i) Kaplan–Meier survival curves of 114
  patients with ESCC stratified according to tumor LSD1 expression irrespective of
  G9a expression (g), tumor G9a expression irrespective of LSD1 expression (h), and
  both LSD1 and G9a expression (i); the pair-wise log-rank test was used to analyze
  overall survival, and median survival (MS, in months) is shown for each group. (j–l)
  Colony formation assay of ESCC cells overexpressing LSD1 (j), G9a (k), or both LSD1
  and G9a (l), with corresponding representative Western blot analyses. ∗p < 0.05
  (unpaired Student's t-test).
