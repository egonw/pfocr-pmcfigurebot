caption: 'Wnt/β‐catenin signaling is enriched in the highly metastatic cells of the
  isogenic model and also in patient metastasis. a) The isogenic nonmetastatic NM
  and highly metastatic HM sublines were selected from the parental HEYA8 cell line
  using migration assays. The lines were intraperitoneally injected into nude mice
  and peritoneal metastasis was observed by bioluminescence imaging of luciferase
  activity. b) HM cells formed overt metastasis at the omentum of mice. Scale bar:
  1 cm. c) Bioinformatic analysis on gene networks of upregulated genes (top 100 protein‐coding
  genes with the lowest FDR and the highest fold change) in HM versus NM shows an
  enrichment in the Wnt‐β‐catenin signaling pathway. d) Immunohistochemistry shows
  higher β‐catenin expression level in metastatic samples than in primary tumors from
  the same ovarian cancer patients. e) The HM gene signature score and the Wnt‐β‐catenin
  hallmark score were calculated for every sample in the TCGA ovarian cancer patient
  cohort by the ssGSEA method, and the correlation between the two scores was calculated
  (left and middle panel). The HM gene signature score was compared among the four
  ovarian cancer molecular subtypes (differentiated, immunoreactive, mesenchymal,
  and proliferative) (right panel).'
