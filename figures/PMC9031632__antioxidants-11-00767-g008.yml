caption: Carbon monoxide exposure induced TLR4 expression. (A) Western blot analysis
  of TLR4 expression after CORM-3 and CORM-A1 treatment in myeloma cells. GAPDH protein
  was used as total protein loading reference. For analysis, the optical density of
  the bands was measured using Scion Image software. (B) Immunofluorescence of Nrf2
  (green) nuclear translocation after CORM-3 or CORM-A1 treatment. Data are expressed
  as mean MFI ± SEM of n ≥ 4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
