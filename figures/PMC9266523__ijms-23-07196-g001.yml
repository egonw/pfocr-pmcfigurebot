caption: Visualization of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway activation in response to APAP treatment.
  (A) Scheme of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. GCN2 is induced by essential amino acid starvation
  while PERK is activated by Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. These two kinases
  are active in their phosphorylated forms (P-GCN2 and P-PERK). The phosphorylation
  of eIF2α upregulates the translation of ATF4 mRNA. The transcription factor ATF4
  enhances the transcription of many CARE-dependent genes that play a critical role
  in the adaptation to cellular stress. (B) CARE-LUC mice were fasted for 16 h and
  then fed a diet with 1% APAP (APAP) for 18 d ad libitum. Ventral views of representative
  mice are depicted at 6, 12, 24 h, 8, and 18 d. Photon emission was quantified using
  ROIs covering the abdominal area (red circles) as described in Materials and Methods.
  Results are given as the fold induction relative to the control (Ctrl) value. The
  graphs show means ± S.E.M. of 6 mice. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001 compared
  to the respective Ctrl value, Student’s t-tests. (C) Mean daily food intake for
  1–8 d and 1–18 d of CARE-LUC mice receiving the Ctrl diet (Ctrl) or the APAP diet
  (APAP) ad libitum. (D) Body weight change during the experiment. In C and D graphs,
  each bar shows the median with interquartile, and dots are individual values. *
  p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01 vs. respective Ctrl; Mann Whitney test.
