figure_title: Aberrant central spindle behavior but not localization of PIPs at the
  plasma membrane is responsible for meiotic cytokinesis defect in cpes mutants
caption: (A, C, and D) Snapshots of live spermatocytes undergoing meiosis I cytokinesis.
  In horizontal view (left), one slice of a z-stack is shown. In cross-sectional view
  across cleavage furrow, maximum intensity projection image is shown (right). Control
  spermatocytes (top row), cpes mutant spermatocytes (middle row), and tubulin-Gal4>UAS-CPES
  rescue (bottom row). (A) Spermatocytes expressing myosin II RLC tagged to GFP under
  its own promoter (sqh) that localizes to contractile ring and mCherry tagged fascetto
  (feo) under the control of Ubi-p63E promoter that binds to central spindle microtubules.
  (B) Quantification of spindle organization defects in live cpes mutant spermatocytes.
  First observable phenotype was measured and plotted. CS detachment from CR, detachment
  of CR from PM, CR slides on PM and CS and CR destabilizing from end. (C) Quantification
  of rate and magnitude of cytokinetic furrow ingression using ImageJ and Prism9.
  Cytokinetic furrow diameter was measured as a function of time in dividing spermatocytes
  from control (n = 12), mutant (n = 10), and rescue sample (n = 9). Statistics were
  performed using 2-way ANOVA multiple comparisons in Prism 9. (D) A representative
  bar diagram for cytokinetic furrow diameter at 40 min post furrow ingression in
  C. (E) Spermatocytes expressing GFP-tagged PH domain of PLCD (UAS-PLCδ-PH-EGFP)
  under the control of Tub-Gal4 that localizes to PM in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PI(4,5)P2) and Ubi-p63E-feo-mCherry. (F) Fluorescence intensity measurements for
  live spermatocyte cysts expressing Tub-Gal4> UAS-PLCδ-PH-EGFP, control (n = 15 cysts),
  cpes mutants (n = 18 cysts), and rescue (n = 20 cysts). Statistics were performed
  using ordinary 1-way ANOVA multiple comparisons in Prism 9. (G) Spermatocytes expressing
  GFP-tagged PH domain of steppke/Grp1 under the control of alpha Tub84B promoter
  (tGPH) that localizes to PM in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PI(3,4,5)P3) and Ubi-p63E-Feo-mCherry. (H) Fluorescence intensity measurements
  for live spermatocyte cysts expressing tGPH; control (n = 8 cysts), cpes mutants
  (n = 12 cysts), and rescue (n = 12 cysts). Statistics were performed using ordinary
  1-way ANOVA multiple comparisons in Prism 9. The data underlying the graphs shown
  in this figure can be found in . CS, central spindle; CR, contractile ring; PH,
  pleckstrin homology; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PM, plasma membrane; RLC,
  regulatory light chain.
