caption: Evolution of protein synthesis. The proposed pathway from amino acids to
  proteins (green) is based on RNAs (red). Identifiable descendants of aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase ribozymes are extinct, and the ancestral function of the ribosomal small
  subunit ribozyme is a mystery. Although this pathway is necessarily very complex
  and speculative, many, of the pathways proposed in the literature are similar. A
  quite different alternative is evolution from an RNA helicase.
