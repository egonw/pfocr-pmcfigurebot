caption: I3 promotes cell differentiation via the downregulation of the VEGF signaling
  pathway. (a) Volcano plots of Kasumi-1 cells. (b) The heatmap of DEGs. The heatmap
  bars from blue to red represent the expression levels of DEGs from low to high.
  (c) The significantly enriched pathways. Kasumi-1 cells were incubated with 0.25 μM
  of I3 for 72 h.
