caption: Lys05 inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin transcriptional reporter. Cells were
  treated with the DMSO as vehicle control, Lys05 (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 µM), and 100
  µM PNU as the negative control for 24 h. Lys05 significantly inhibited transcriptional
  reporter activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in RKO B/R cells stimulated
  with both 2 µM BIO (A) and 3 µM CHIR99021 (B). Lys05 also inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin
  pathway transcriptional reporter in SW480 B/R cells (C). The heatmap summarizes
  the effects of Lys05 by concentration and cell type (D). n = 3, performed in triplicate.
  One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001, **** p < 0.0001). Error bars denote mean ± SEM.
