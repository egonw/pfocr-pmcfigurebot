caption: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) relieves tissue damage, neuronal
  degeneration and necrosis. (A) Schematic diagram of the relationship between ultrasonic
  path and rat brain anatomy. The inset shows a vertically incident ultrasonic beam.
  (B) A representative magnetic resonance imaging image of a rat brain. (C) LIFUS
  in rats. (D) Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining images of three groups
  of cortical tissues showing areas of necrosis, Scale=50 um. (E) Representative Nissl
  staining of three groups of cortical tissues demonstrates necrotic degeneration
  of neurons, Scale=50 um.
