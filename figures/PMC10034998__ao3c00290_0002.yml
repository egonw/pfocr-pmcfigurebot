caption: 19F NMR spectra of the intermediates of fluorinated Biginelli reaction intermediates.
  (a) NMR spectra of reaction between thiourea and 3-fluorobenzaldehyde, operating
  through the iminium pathway. (b) NMR spectra of the reaction between thiourea and
  ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate, forming intermediate E-3 with a fluorine resonance
  at −78.50 ppm, which proceeds through the enamine pathway. (c) NMR spectra of the
  reaction between 3-fluorobenzaldehyde and ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate, forming
  intermediate K-2 with two fluorine resonances at −80.22 ppm, which proceeds through
  the Knoevenagel pathway. (d) Pathways pictured were operative in various kinetics
  experiments to reveal the production of their intermediates over time with 19F NMR.
