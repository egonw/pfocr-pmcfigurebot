caption: Western blotting. Numbers on the right indicate molecular weight. (a) Western
  blot analysis of whole-brain tissue from a normal fetus and probands in case 1 and
  case 2. Compared with control, the density of ZNF77.CEP290 and CC2D2A appeared to
  decreased. (b, c) Western blot analysis of Flag-tagged ZNF77 and Flag-tagged mutated
  ZNF77 transfected HEK293cell cell. Lanes 1–3 demonstrate empty plasmid as control,
  with lanes 4–6 demonstrating ZNF77-transfected cells and lanes 7–9 mutated ZNF77-transfected.
  Density of the proteins is directly shown by relative intensity in histogram. Remarkable
  increase is noted by asterisk above cross line; the more asterisks the stronger
  increase. SHH has increased when ZNF77 was transfected and enhanced more significantly
  when mutated ZNF77. CC2D2A showed notable increased when mutated ZNF77 was transfected.
  CEP290 has no obvious change
