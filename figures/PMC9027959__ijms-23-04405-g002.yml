caption: 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) suppressed tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced
  intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in immortalized Fischer rat Schwann
  cells 1 (IFRS1). (a) Treatment with tBHP for 30 min induced ROS production in IFRS1
  cells as monitored by fluorescence microscopy whereas pretreatment with 10 μM DHA
  for 12 h significantly suppressed tBHP-induced ROS production. Scale bar: 100 μM.
  (b) Quantification of fluorescent intensity of ROS in IFRS1 cells. Each value represents
  the mean ± S.E. of eight experiments. **: p < 0.01 compared with the control; ##:
  p < 0.01 compared with the 50 μM tBHP control.'
