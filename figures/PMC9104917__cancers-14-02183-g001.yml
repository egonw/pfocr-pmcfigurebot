caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathways with selected inhibitors targeting enzymes.
  Ceramide, which is the intermediate molecule in sphingolipid metabolic pathway,
  can be formed either through de novo synthesis (green), sphingomyelin hydrolysis
  (blue), cerebrosides (orange), or salvage pathway (red). De novo synthesis starts
  with the functions of serine palmitoyltransferase (generates 3-keto sphinganine),
  3-ketosphinganine reductase (generates sphinganine), (dihydro)ceramide synthases
  (generates dihydroceramide), and dihydroceramide desaturase (generates ceramide).
  The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the functions of sphingomyelinases can also generate
  ceramide (blue). Glucosylceramidase and Î²-galactosylceramidase can break down glucosylceramide
  and galactosylceramide, respectively, to generate ceramide (orange path). In the
  salvage pathway, ceramide synthases again can convert sphingosine to ceramide. In
  reverse, ceramide can be metabolized by ceramidases to generate sphingosine, which
  can then be phosphorylated to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by the functions
  of sphingosine kinases. S1P is broken down by the actions of S1P phosphatase to
  restore sphingosine or by S1P lyase functions, yielding ethanolamine 1-phosphate
  and C16 fatty aldehyde to exit the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Sphingomyelin
  synthase transfers phosphorylcholine to ceramide from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to
  generate sphingomyelin and, thus, releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) []. Additionally,
  ceramide kinase functions to converts ceramide into ceramide-1-phosphate, while
  phosphatidate phosphatase functions to restore ceramide from ceramide-1-phosphate.
  In the generation of complex sphingolipids from ceramide, glucosylceramide synthase
  and ceramide galactosyltransferase produce glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide,
  respectively. Generation of glycosphingolipid series requires the synthesis of lactosylceramide
  from glucosylceramide (orange, dotted arrows). The enzymes can be inhibited by pharmacological
  inhibitors to regulate the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in both in vivo and in
  vitro studies. B4GALT6, beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6 []; GAL3ST1, galactosylceramide
  sulfotransferase; PDMP, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol []; THI,
  2-acetyl-5-tetrahydroxybutyl imidazole; DPO, 4-deoxy pyridoxine.
