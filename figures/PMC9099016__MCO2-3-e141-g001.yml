caption: Important mechanisms and roles of lncRNAs in retinoblastoma. (A) SNHG16 is
  upregulated in retinoblastoma, and it promotes tumor cell proliferation and inhibits
  apoptosis by regulating miR‐140‐5p; (B) LINC00324 can regulate STAT3 expression
  by binding to miR‐769‐5p, and LINC00324 associate with TNM stage, optic nerve invasion,
  and lower overall survival through this pathway; (C) upregulated PROX1‐AS1 can promote
  chemosensitivity by regulating miR‐519d‐3p and SOX2; (D) MT1JP expression is decreased
  in retinoblastoma. The expression of MT1JP can repress proliferation, metastasis,
  invasion, and the EMT progression by inhibiting Wnt/β‐catenin pathway; (E) MBNL1‐AS1
  was found to be downregulated in retinoblastoma. MBNL1‐AS1 can inhibit the proliferation
  and migration of Y79 cells by binding to the miR‐338‐5p and influencing Wnt/β‐catenin
  pathway (originally made on Adobe Illustrator)
