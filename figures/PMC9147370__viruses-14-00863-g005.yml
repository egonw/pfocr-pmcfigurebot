caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the DEPs
  identified in PK-15 cells during SVA infection. (A–C) KEGG pathway analyses for
  the DEPs identified at 12, 24 and 36 hpi, respectively. The different colors indicate
  6 first-category KEGG pathways. The Y axis represents the name of each second-category
  KEGG pathway, and the X axis represents the number of proteins in each second-category.
  (D–F) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses for the DEPs identified at 12, 24 and 36
  hpi, respectively. The UniProt accession numbers for the corresponding proteins
  are marked on the left of the chord diagrams. The log2 fold changes (log2FC) of
  the upregulated and downregulated proteins are marked with different colors between
  the red and blue gamut. The names of the top 15 KEGG signaling pathways are marked
  on the right of the chord diagram in 15 different colors. The Z-scores for the relevant
  KEGG signaling pathways are also marked on the right.
