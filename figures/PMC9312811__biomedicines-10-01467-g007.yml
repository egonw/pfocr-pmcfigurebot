caption: Chrysin induced cell death or cell-protective autophagy in A375SM and A375P
  human melanoma cancer cells. Cells were pretreated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ,
  25 μM, 2 h) or 3−methyladenine (3−MA, 2 mM, 1 h) and subsequently treated with indicated
  concentrations of chrysin for 24 h. (A) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
  (B) Protein levels of Bax, Bcl−2, and LC3 were measured by Western blotting. β−actin
  was used as a loading control. Quantification was performed in three independent
  experiments using ImageJ, normalizing the intensities of the bands to the controls.
  Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation for three samples. Significance
  was determined by Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, compared with the control.
