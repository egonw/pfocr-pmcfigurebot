caption: 'Transcriptomic analyses of tumors using NanoString Immune Profiling assay.
  (A) Volcano plot showing differential expression of immune related genes in anti-PD-1
  plus SGT-53 versus the baseline of anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Volcano plot is presented
  as fold change in gene expression [log2(fold change)] against significance of change
  [−log10(p-value)]. (B) The list of genes with a significant change. (C) GSEA analysis
  of 28 identified differentially expressed genes. Groups reflect main categories
  of GO terms: biological process; cellular component; molecular function, hallmark,
  and canonical pathway. Vertical and horizontal axes represent each category term
  and −log10(FDR adjusted p-value) of the corresponding term, respectively.'
