caption: CASC11 promotes proliferation of PCa cells. Expression levels of CASC11 were
  (A) significantly downregulated in sh-CASC11-infected PCa cells and (B) significantly
  upregulated in OE-CASC11-transfected cells. (C and D) Cell Counting Kit-8 assay
  was used to investigate the proliferative effects of CASC11 knockdown or overexpression
  on PCa cells. (E-H) Colony formation assay was applied to investigate the proliferative
  ability of PCa cells. Scale bar, 500 µm. (I-N) EdU assay was applied to investigate
  the proliferative effects of CASC11 knockdown or overexpression in PCa cells. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. sh-NC or vector, or as indicated. CASC11, cancer
  susceptibility candidate 11; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine; NC, negative control;
  OE-CASC11, CASC11 overexpression plasmid; PCa, prostate cancer; sh, short hairpin.
article_title: Long non-coding RNA CASC11 interacts with YBX1 to promote prostate
  cancer progression by suppressing the p53 pathway.
