caption: Dual effects of OsCPK18 phosphorylation motif editing. (a) Ca2+ sensitivity
  of OsCPK18 and OsCPK18‐GE alleles. The kinase activity was analysed with the ADP‐Glo
  assay using Histone III‐S protein substrate (see the Methods). RLU, relative luminescent
  unit. The data are presented as the mean ± s.d. (n = 3 technical replicates). (b)
  OsCPK18‐GE alleles were not phosphorylated by OsMKK4DD‐OsMPK5 in rice protoplasts.
  NanoLuc‐tagged OsCPK18DA and OsCPK18DA‐GE were analysed by in‐gel detection after
  Phos‐tag SDS–PAGE. P‐OsCPK18, phosphorylated forms of OsCPK18DA. (c–f) Comparison
  of protein interactions between OsMPK5 and OsCPK18‐derived proteins using split
  luciferase (LUC) complementation assay. OsMPK5 is fused with N‐terminal LUC fragments
  (Nluc) and OsCPK18‐GE3/8 and OsCPK18T505A were fused with C‐terminal LUC fragments
  (Cluc). These Nluc and Cluc fused proteins were co‐expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana
  leaves by agroinfiltration. Rice GSK2 and BZR1 were used as positive controls. Representative
  photos from three independent experiments are shown in (c–e). The relative luminescence
  was calculated from three independent experiments and presented as mean ± s.d. in
  (f). ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01 (paired Student's t‐test). (g) Schematic illustration
  of the OsCPK18/4‐OsMPK5 regulatory circuit in rice. OsCPK18 and OsCPK4, whose activities
  are dependent on cellular Ca2+ concentration, positively regulate growth but negatively
  regulate immunity. OsCPK18/4 suppresses rice immunity through phosphorylating OsMPK5
  and other MAPK‐independent pathways. OsMPK5 retrophosphorylates OsCPK18 and attenuates
  its Ca2+ sensitivity. Cellular Ca2+ level and MAPK phosphorylation together fine
  tunes OsCPK18/4 activity to balance growth and defence. In OsCPK4/18‐GE plants,
  OsMPK5‐mediated suppression of OsCPK4/18 is abolished while CDPK‐mediate regulation
  of OsMPK5 was also attenuated. As a result, OsCPK4/18‐GE plants improve rice yield
  and defence. The dashed line indicates the uncharacterized signalling pathway. Arrow
  and blunt lines indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively. Round end
  lines indicate concentration/dose‐dependent regulation.
