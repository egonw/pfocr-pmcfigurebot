caption: Select KFs are enriched in MSI CRC. (A) Patterns of oncogenic alterations
  including KFs and somatic mutation burden in MSI and MSS CRCs. Neither MMR alterations
  nor elevated tumor mutational burden was seen in KF-positive MSS tumors. Co-occurring
  oncogenic alterations were rare in KF-positive tumors. (B) Demographic and genomic
  features of the patients in this data set are consistent with previous studies.
  (C) Biallelic inactivation of the MMR pathway was less common in KF-positive MSI
  tumors (top) compared with KF-negative MSI tumors (bottom), consistent with the
  findings of Cocco et al that MLH1 methylation is enriched in this subset. Cases
  with two mutations in the same gene (2 plus mutations) were assumed to be biallelic.
  (D) Frequency of specific KFs in all MSI and MSS CRCs (top) and frequency of specific
  fusions with in KF-positive MSI and KF-positive MSS CRCs (bottom). CRC, colorectal
  carcinoma; IQR, interquartile range; KF, kinase fusion; MMR, mismatch repair; MSI-H,
  microsatellite instability high; MSS, microsatellite stable; TMB, tumor mutational
  burden; WT, wild type.
