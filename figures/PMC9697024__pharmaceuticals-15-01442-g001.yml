caption: 'Apigenin reduces serum levels of UA, CRE, and BUN, and increases urine levels
  of UA and CRE in HUA mice. Serum levels of UA (A; μM, n = 10), CRE (B; μM, n = 10),
  and BUN (C; mM, n = 10). Urine levels of UA on days 0, 2, and 6 (D–F; μM, n = 10,
  6 and 10). Urine levels of CRE on days 0, 2, and 6 (G–I; μM, n = 10, 10 and 7).
  Allop denotes allopurinol-treated group, APL denotes low dose of apigenin-treated
  group, APM denotes medium dose of apigenin-treated group, APH denotes high dose
  of apigenin-treated group. ##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05 vs. the NC group. ** p < 0.01,
  * p < 0.05 vs. the HC group.'
