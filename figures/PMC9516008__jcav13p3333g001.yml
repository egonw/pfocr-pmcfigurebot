caption: Snake venom induces autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (A) SW480
  cells were treated with snake venom (0.05, 0.1, 1, 0.5, and 1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The
  indicated protein levels were evaluated by immunoblotting. (B) SW480 cells were
  treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for the indicated time. The indicated protein levels
  were evaluated by immunoblotting. (C) SW480 cells were treated with snake venom
  (0.1, 0.5, and 1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Using fluorescent microscopy, LC3 puncta formation
  was detected after snake venom treatment. The percentage of cells with the LC3 puncta
  was calculated. (D) SW480 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for the indicated
  time. Using fluorescent microscopy, LC3 puncta formation was detected after snake
  venom treatment. The percentage of cells with LC3 puncta was calculated.
