caption: 'Expression of SOX8 and Notch signaling detected in Enza-R cells. (a) Both
  LNCaP and Enza-R cells were treated with increasing concentrations of enzalutamide
  for 24 hours, and the IC50 was detected by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.
  (b–d) mRNA and protein expression of SOX8, Notch4, and Hes5 assessed by RT-PCR,
  Western blot, and immunofluorescence (×200). ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01. ns: no significance.'
