caption: CCL22 could polarize TAMs towards M2a macrophages in cervical cancer via
  an autocrine pathway. Total RNA from si-CCL22-TAMs and con-TAMs was analyzed by
  real-time PCR in triplicate for CCL22 mRNA expression (a). Flowcytometric analysis
  of MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of CD206 on the surface of CCL22 silenced cells
  (si-CCL22) TAMs and unsilenced controls (con-TAMs) co-cultured with HeLa and Siha
  cells (b,d). Total RNA from CCL22-vectors treated TAMs and con-TAMs was analyzed
  by real-time PCR in triplicate for CCL22 mRNA expression (f). Flowcytometric analysis
  of MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of CD206 on the surface of CCL22-vectors-treated
  TAMs and con-TAMs co-cultured with HeLa and Siha cells (g,i). Red line represents
  MFI of FMO CD206 group; blue line represents MFI of control CCL22 group; orange
  line represents si-CCL22 or CCL22-vectors treated group. Bar graphs (c,e,h,j) represent
  the mean and SD of MFI of CD206 in treated macrophages co-cultured with cervical
  cancer cell line HeLa and Siha, respectively, for at least three independent experiments.
