caption: ALV-J and REV synergistically activated NF-κB/KIAA1199/EGFR signaling pathway
  crosstalk. (A) Co-infection with ALV-J and REV enhanced the NF-κB p65 mRNA expression
  levels in DF-1 cells at 72 hpi. (B) ALV-J and REV synergistically enhanced NF-κB
  p65 protein levels in DF-1 cells at 72 hpi, as detected using the NF-κB p65 ELISA
  kit. (C) ALV-J and REV synergistically enhanced phosphorylated IκBα expression levels
  in DF-1 cells at 72 hpi, as detected using the phosphorylated IκBα ELISA kit. ALV-J
  and REV synergistically enhanced EGFR mRNA expression (D) and protein (E) levels
  in DF-1 cells at 72 hpi. Protein levels were estimated using WB with anti-EGFR antibody.
  (F) mRNA expression levels of NF-κB p65, KIAA1199, and EGFR were suppressed after
  incubation with NF-κB p65 shRNA at 48 hpi. (G) NF-κB p65 protein levels were inhibited
  by NF-κB p65 shRNA, as detected using the NF-κB p65 ELISA kit. (H) Protein levels
  of KIAA1199 and EGFR were suppressed by NF-κB p65 shRNA at 48 hpi, as detected using
  WB with anti-KIAA1199 antibody and anti-EGFR antibody. (I) mRNA expression levels
  of KIAA1199, NF-κB p65, and EGFR were suppressed by KIAA1199 shRNA. (J) Protein
  levels of NF-κB p65 were inhibited by KIAA1199 shRNA, as detected using the NF-κB
  p65 ELISA kit. (K) Protein levels of KIAA1199 and EGFR were suppressed by KIAA1199
  shRNA at 48 hpi, as detected using WB with anti-KIAA1199 and anti-EGFR antibodies.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM for n = 3, with each experiment being performed
  in triplicate. ** p ≤ 0.01 determined using Student′s t-test versus the Neg. Ctrl.
  group. * p ≤ 0.05 determined using Student′s t-test versus the Neg. Ctrl. group.
