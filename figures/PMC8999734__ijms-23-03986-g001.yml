caption: 'Inhibitory effects of Loratadine on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes and the transcriptional activation of inflammatory transcription factors.
  (a,b) RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with the indicated concentrations of Loratadine
  (20–40 μM) or prednisolone (50–200 μM) for 30 min. The cells were treated with LPS
  (1 μg/mL) for 6 h, and the mRNA expression levels of MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, and GAPDH
  (control) were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
  and agarose gel electrophoresis. Visualization of DNA bands was achieved by exposing
  the gel to UV irradiation. (c–f) HEK293T cells were transfected with AP-1-luc, MyD88,
  TRIF, and β-galactosidase (control) using PEI for 24 h. Cells were treated with
  the indicated concentrations of Loratadine (20–40 μM) for 6 h before cell harvesting.
  The expression of AP-1 was measured by luciferase activity. (f) HEK293T cells were
  treated with the indicated doses of Loratadine (20–40 μM) for 24 h, and viability
  was measured using the MTT cell viability assay. ## p < 0.01 compared to normal
  group; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to control group. All data are presented
  (a–f) as mean ± standard deviation of the experiments performed with 4–6 samples.'
