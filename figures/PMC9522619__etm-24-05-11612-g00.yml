caption: 'G1 arrest: ATM can phosphorylate CHK2 to activate the P53 pathway and the
  accumulation of P21 and finally cause the ubiquitination degradation of CDC25A to
  suppress CDK2. S and G2 arrest: CHK1 is primarily activated by ATR, which promotes
  CDC25A/B/C degradation and inhibits CDK1 and cell cycle progression (,,,). ATM,
  Ataxia telangiectasia mutated; CHK, checkpoint kinase; CDC25, cell division cycle
  25; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related
  kinase.'
