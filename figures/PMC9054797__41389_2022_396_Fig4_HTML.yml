figure_title: NSE enhances the stem cell-like characteristics of SCLC cells through
  activating the BMP2/Smad/ID1 pathway
caption: A KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in
  TGF-βsignaling in H69-shNSE cells compared to the control cells. B The heatmap showed
  the differential expression of genes involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway between
  H69-shNSE and control cells. C Relative NBL1 mRNA levels in SCLC cells with overexpression
  or knockdown NSE. D Western blot images showing NBL1 expression was regulated by
  overexpression or knockdown NSE. E The relative expression of NBL1 in different
  groups was shown as histograms. F Western blot images showing total protein content
  of Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, and the housekeeping gene β-actin in H446 cells transduced
  with the empty vector (EV) and vector overexpressing NSE. G All western blot images
  were analyzed by ImageJ software, and the relative protein expression (protein/β-actin),
  including total Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, was quantified in a column graph. H Western
  blot images showing total protein content of Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, and β-actin
  in H69 cells transduced with the scrambled shRNA (NTC) and shNSE. I The relative
  protein expression, including total Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, was normalized to β-actin
  and quantified as a column graph. J Western blot images showing protein levels of
  Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, and β-actin in H446 cells with silencing BMP2 compared to
  the control cells. K The column graph represented the relative protein expression,
  including total Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, ID1, with β-actin as normalization. L The protein
  levels of OCT4, Nanog, and SOX2 were analyzed using western blot in H446 cells infected
  with NSE or shBMP2 plasmid compared to the control cells. M The histogram showed
  the relative protein expression, including OCT4, Nanog, and SOX2, normalizing to
  β-actin. N The stemness capability of NSE-overexpression cells was evaluated by
  the sphere-formation analysis (original magnification ×20, scale bar 100 μm). O
  Quantitative analysis of spheroid cells. Data are presented as mean values ± SD
  for three independent experiments. P The stemness capability of NSE-overexpression
  cells was analyzed by the Extreme Limiting Dilutions Analysis website.
