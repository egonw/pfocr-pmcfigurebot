caption: 'SOCS3 expression is upregulated in lung tissue. (a) Western blot analysis
  of SOCS3 in lung tissue, β-actin was used as the internal reference. (b) The photomicrographs
  of immunohistochemical staining for SOCS3 among lung tissue samples are displayed.
  The nucleus is colored in blue and the positive cells are colored in brown (scale
  bar is 50 µm, ×400). (c) Semiquantitative analysis on the basis of the intensity
  of protein bands in eight groups. (d) The relative SOCS3 gene expression. Error
  bars represent SD, n = 3. ∗, #, &, Δ represent P values <0.05 which are considered
  statistically significant. ∗ versus MC (model control), # versus herbs low, & versus
  herbs mid, and Δ versus herbs high.'
