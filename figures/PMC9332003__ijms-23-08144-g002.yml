caption: 'EPO protects against memory deterioration in Aβ-induced Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD) model mice. (A,B) long-term recognition memory function assessed with NORT
  and (C,D) long-term event-space memory assessment using a passive avoidance task
  in the AD mouse. Mice were analyzed for NORT on days −7, 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. On
  day 5, they had acquisition phase for passive avoidance, and after retention duration,
  the mice were examined on days 12, 19, 26, and 33. n = 8 to 10 mice per group. Significant
  inter-group differences were found with # p < 0.0001 for B6 normal and Aβ+EPO groups
  compared to the Aβ+saline group according to two-way repeated-measures ANOVA in
  (A,C); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005, and **** p < 0.0001 for B6 normal
  and Aβ+EPO groups compared to the Aβ+saline group according to independent t-test
  in (B,D).'
