caption: Pathway enrichment analysis, including the metabolites differentially expressed
  in ACLF in patients treated with simvastatin plus rifaximin compared to those in
  patients treated with placebo in the intervention cohort. The y axis represents
  the P value; the x axis represents pathway impact (pathways more likely to be modified
  in ACLF compared with decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF). Node color is based
  on the P value (red indicates higher level of significance), and node radius is
  based on the pathway impact value. A significant enrichment for several metabolic
  pathways was identified for these metabolites (P < 0.05).
