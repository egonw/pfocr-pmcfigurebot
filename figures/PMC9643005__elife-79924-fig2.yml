figure_title: tSNE analysis of the B cell phenotypes and frequencies relative to COVID-19
  clinical parameters including disease severity, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, SARS-CoV-2
  viremia, and HIV status
caption: A total of 80,000 CD19+ B cells, all sampled at baseline, from four patient
  groups (20,000 cells per group) were used in an unbiased tSNE analysis. Patients
  were grouped by decreasing disease severity according to an ordinal scale ranging
  from 3 to 1 (OS3 to 1) and a healthy control group. There was an equal contribution
  from people living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV-ve patients per group except for the
  control group. Three B cell phenotyping panels were used, focusing on homing (A,
  B), maturation (C), and regulatory (D) markers. Each panel included an anchor panel
  of CD19, IgD, IgM, CD27, and CD38. The key to the colouring of the different tSNE
  clusters is included alongside with a description of the phenotype. The phenotype
  is then depicted as a heatmap of the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each
  surface marker within that cluster, followed by a heatmap of the cluster frequency
  relative to ordinal scale (OS3 to 1); neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) cut-off
  of 3.0 to separate moderate and mild inflammation, SARS-CoV-2 viremia (S-CoV), and
  HIV status. (B) The frequency of each B cell phenotypic cluster identified by tSNE
  depicted as pie charts, separated based on disease severity (OS3 to 1) and controls.
