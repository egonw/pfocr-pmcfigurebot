caption: 'Vgll3 regulates protein and mRNA levels of the TGF-β3 signaling pathway.
  (a and b) QPCR was used to detect the effects of Vgll3-overexpressed plasmid and
  knockdown plasmid on TGF-β3 pathway markers. (c and d) Effects of Vgll3-overexpressed
  plasmid and knockdown plasmid on TGF-β3 pathway markers were detected by WB. Note:
  compared with control, ∗∗P < 0.01.'
