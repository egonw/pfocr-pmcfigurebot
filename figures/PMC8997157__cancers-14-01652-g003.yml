caption: PI3K/AKT signaling axis regulates all major classes of cytoskeletal components.
  The activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays key roles in the assembly
  of nascent actin filaments, polymerization of microtubules, and abundance of intermediate
  filaments. Collectively, these changes enhance the motility and migratory potential
  of cancer cells. Image created with BioRender.com (accessed on 14 February 2022).
