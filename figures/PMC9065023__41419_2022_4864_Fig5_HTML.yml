figure_title: Hif1α promotes the proliferation and repopulation of microglia after
  SCI by maintaining their stemness
caption: 'A Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showing the upstream regulatory factors for
  DEGs in PaMG1 compared to hMG. B IHC images reveal hypoxic conditions in the lesion
  sites (pimonidazole binding area) after SCI. C Statistical histogram of B, n = 12
  sections from four independent mice per group. D Flow cytometric analyses showing
  the absolute number of microglia in Hif1α cKO mice and control mice after SCI at
  7 and 28 dpi. Ccr2 was used to exclude monocyte-derived cells. E Statistical histogram
  of D. n = 6 independent mice per group, multiple unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test,
  ****P < 0.0001. F IHC images showing proliferative microglia (Ki67+ tdT+ cells)
  at 3 dpi. Scale bar: 50 μm. G Statistical histogram for F. n = 6 independent mice
  per group, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, ****P < 0.0001. H IHC images show
  the expression of c-myc in microglia (tdT+ cells) at 3 dpi. Scale bar: 50 μm. I
  Statistical histogram of H. n = 4 independent mice per group, unpaired two-tailed
  Student’s t-test, ****P < 0.0001.'
