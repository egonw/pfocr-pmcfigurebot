figure_title: Pathways of mitochondrial quality control
caption: a Activation of the UPRmtpathway is triggered by the accumulation of unfolded
  proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, expression of mitochondrial protein import
  components, and upregulation of chaperones and proteases for reestablishing mitochondrial
  proteostasis. b Molecular chaperones and proteolytic enzymes in the mitochondria
  perform a major function in refolding or destroying mitochondrial misfolded and
  unfolded proteins. c Mitochondrial proteins are likely to be decomposed by being
  transported to lysosomes, where vesicles formed from mitochondrial tubules seize
  specific mitochondrial cargos for lysis. d Fragmented dysfunctional mitochondria
  are removed by mitophagy. Bnip3, FUNDC1, and NIX are mitophagy receptors that bind
  LC3 to tether mitochondria to autophagosomes. OMM proteins and Parkin are ubiquitinated
  when PINK1 phosphorylates proteins on the surface of depolarized mitochondria. The
  p62 adaptor can recognize ubiquitinated proteins to initiate mitophagy. UPRmt mitochondrial
