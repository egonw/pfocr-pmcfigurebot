figure_title: Mucin’s role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
caption: Mucins regulate the EMT, a reversible pathophysiological process like loss
  of cell polarity, decreased surface expression of epithelial markers, and increased
  expression of mesenchymal markers. MUC1 phosphorylates STAT3, which regulates TWIST1,
  also MUC1 directly regulates the expression of Slug, Vimentin, and E-cadherin proteins
  in TNBC. Moreover, MUC1 promotes the transcription of ZEB1 via the activation/nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB p65. MUC1 promotes the induction of EMT independent of SMAD4,
  and it is regulated by the interaction of MUC1-CT with the TGF-β signaling pathway
  in pancreatic cancer. MUC4 activates FAK directly or by interacting with HER2. This
  leads to the activation of MKK7, JNK1/2, and Akt pathways and decreased expression
  of epithelial markers and induction of mesenchymal markers. MUC5AC/integrin-FAK
  dependent signaling pathway upregulates Vimentin and N-Cadherin and downregulates
  the epithelial markers Cytokeratin 18 and E-cadherin in lung cancer. MUC16-FAK interaction
  induces the EMT process through the Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling axis in PDAC. EMT
  markers upregulated genes are indicated in red-colored arrow and downregulated genes
  using the green colored arrow. MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC16 mediated signaling
  pathways and their downstream target genes associated with EMT markers. Focal Adhesion
  Protein-Tyrosine Kinases (FAK); Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2);
  c-Jun N-terminal Kinases 1/2 (JNK1/2); Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases

  3 (STAT3); Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGFβ); Transforming Growth Factor-Beta
  Receptor I/II (TGFβR I/ II); Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC); Zinc Finger E-box-Binding
