figure_title: A signaling pathway involving TgVPS15 regulates apicoplast inheritance
  and autophagy
caption: TgVPS15 may regulate TgPI3K and facilitate the formation of PI3P (). Under
  steady state conditions, PI3P regulates the localization of TgATG18 to vesicular
  compartments (), which in turn promotes the trafficking of TgATG8 to the apicoplast
  membrane [] and is critical for the inheritance of the apicoplast during parasite
  division. Under nutrient limiting conditions, TgVPS15 may facilitate the generation
  of PI3P via TgPI3K at pre-autophagosome-like vesicles () resulting in the localization
  of TgATG18 to this compartment (), which sets the stage for the formation of autophagosome
  to which TgATG8 is trafficked and where it is conjugated to autophagosomal membrane
  (Figs  and ) and contributes to the process of autophagy.
