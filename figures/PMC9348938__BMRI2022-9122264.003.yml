caption: 'Adropin inhibits VSMC osteogenic differentiation in vitro. (a, b) The protein
  expression levels of calcification-associated markers (BMP2, ALP, OPG, OCN, and
  Runx2) in VSMCs were quantified using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading
  control. Each experiment was performed three times, and data are presented as the
  mean ± SD. VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle cells; BMP2: bone morphogenetic protein
  2; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; OPG: osteoprotegerin; OCN: osteocalcin; Runx2: runt-related
  transcription factor 2. ∗p < 0.05 compared to control. #p < 0.05 compared to the
  Cacl2 group.'
