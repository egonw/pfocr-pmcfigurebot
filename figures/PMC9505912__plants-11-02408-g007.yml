caption: Model representing the anthocyanin synthesis process in the M. ruthenica
  species. In this study, PFMs served as the control group. The referred model for
  a better understanding of the formation of the pale-yellow M. ruthenica flower was
  drawn using Adobe Illustrator 2019. ER represents the endoplasmic reticulum. The
  crucial candidate gene IDs are indicated at the side of related enzymes. Blue-colored
  grids indicate the downregulated genes, and red-colored grids indicate upregulated
  genes. The arrow refers to the steps of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (ABP).
  CHS, CHI, F3H, and F3′H were upstream genes involved in the ABP. DFR, ANS, and UFGT
  were downstream genes involved in the ABP. Briefly, the low expression level of
  4 CHS, 2 CHI, 3 F3H, 2 F3′H, 4 DFR, 2 ANS, and 2 UFGT might disrupt the anthocyanin
  synthesis, leading to the formation of the pale-yellow petals seen in YFM. UFGT
  catalyzes the last step of the ABP, the UFGT enzyme glycolyzed anthocyanidin into
  anthocyanin by adding sugar moieties, thereby increasing the hydrophilicity and
  stability of anthocyanin.
