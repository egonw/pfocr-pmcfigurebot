caption: CTS promotes mitochondrial biosynthesis via the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling
  pathway. HaCaT cells and HFF-1 cells were treated with CTS (0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 μM)
  for 4 h and irradiated with UVB (200 mJ/cm2) or UVA (15 J/cm2), respectively. Then,
  the cells were supplemented with the corresponding doses of CTS and incubated for
  another 0.5 h before analysis. (A) Protein levels of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α in
  HaCaT cells as measured by western blot. The plots beside the blots show the relative
  expression levels of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α as determined by grayscale analysis
  of the bands in the blots. (B) Protein levels of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α in HFF-1
  cells as measured by western blot. The plots beside the blots show the relative
  expression levels of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α as determined by grayscale analysis
  of the bands in the blots. All data are mean ± SD from three independent experiments,
  “##” indicates significantly different from the control (no irradiation and CTS
  treatment) at the p < 0.01 level, whereas “*” and “**” indicate significantly different
  from the UV-irradiated cells without CTS pretreatment at the p < 0.05 and p < 0.01
  levels, respectively.
