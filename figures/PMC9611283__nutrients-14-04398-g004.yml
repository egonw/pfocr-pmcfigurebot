caption: Gene expression of TLR signaling pathway and intestinal mucosal barrier-related
  factors in the distal intestines (n = 6). (A,B) Gene expression of Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), adaptor proteins, and downstream regulator molecules; (C) Gene expression
  of inflammatory cytokines; (D) Gene expression of epithelial cell apoptosis and
  proliferation. Results were expressed as means Â± S.E., and different superscript
  letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).
