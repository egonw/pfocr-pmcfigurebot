caption: In vivo HBCs at 24 hpi demonstrate diminished Rac1-mediated signaling as
  a consequence of HBC-specific Rac1 cKO(A–L) Representative immunofluorescence images
  from Rac1 WT (A–C) and Rac1 fl/fl (F–H) OE demonstrate that HBC expression of nuclear
  p63 at 24 hpi (within cyan outlines, C and H) is not significantly affected by HBC-specific
  Rac1 cKO (quantified in K, each circle denotes a tdTom+ Nuclear Obj. as represented
  in C and H [n = 3 mice, 132 Rac1 WT HBCs and 124 Rac1 fl/fl HBCs]). Representative
  immunofluorescence images from Rac1 WT (A, D, E) and Rac1 fl/fl (F, I, J) OE demonstrate
  that nuclear pcJun at 24 hpi (within green outlines, E and J) is diminished by HBC-specific
  Rac1 cKO (quantified in L, each triangle denotes a tdTom+ Nuclear Obj. as represented
  in E and J [n = 3 mice, 132 Rac1 WT HBCs and 124 Rac1 fl/fl HBCs]). Rac1 WT used
  as baseline, error bars indicate mean ± SEM, Mann-Whitney test, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 (K,
  L). Scale bar equals 10 μm (A).
