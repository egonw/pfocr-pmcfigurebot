caption: Blockade of T‐cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT)
  might restore the expression of activated markers and killing function of natural
  killer (NK) cells. (A) Experimental process of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell
  (BMSC) and NK‐cell co‐culture. (B) The expression of markers of activated NK cells,
  NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44 and CD69 was detected using flow cytometry after blocking TIGIT
  and CD226 mAbs were added. TIGIT mAbs and TIGIT+CD226 mAbs groups showed restored
  expression of these activated markers on NK cells. The results are presented as
  mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (left). We added the U266 cell line into the co‐culture
  systems, and the apoptosis of U266 cells gradually increased after adding TIGIT
  mAbs (right). (C) IFN‐γ secretion was detected using flow cytometry and was increased
  in NK cells after the blockade of TIGIT. (D) Expression levels of SHIP‐1 and pErk
  in the TIGIT/CD155 signalling pathway were detected using flow cytometry. Moreover,
  SHIP‐1 expression decreased and Erk phosphorylation increased with the blockade
  of TIGIT. *p <  .05, **p <  .01, ***p <  .001 and ****p <  .0001
