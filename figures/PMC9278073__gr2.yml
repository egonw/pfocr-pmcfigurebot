caption: 'Survival, proliferation rate and growth status of BMSCs 3D cultured in hydrogel
  scaffolds at different cell densities. (a) Live/dead stain images of BMSCs in 3D
  printed hydrogel scaffolds at different cell densities after 3, 7, and 14 days of
  culture in vitro (green represents live cells, red represents dead cells). Scale
  bar: 100 ​μm. Statistics of the proliferation (b) and survival rate (c) of BMSCs
  in each group of hydrogel scaffolds after culturing for 3, 7, and 14 days. (d) Images
  of F-actin staining of BMSCs cytoskeleton in the T7 group on the day 7 of culture
  showing cell division and contact with adjacent cells under a randomly selected
  field of view. Scale bar: 10 ​μm αp<0.05 vs T5; βp<0.05 vs T6; γp<0.05 vs T7. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the Web version of this article.)'
