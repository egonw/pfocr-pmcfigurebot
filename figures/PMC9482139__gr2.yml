caption: The crosstalk between AMPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway associated
  with the energy metabolism in BC. The activation of AMPK signaling promotes the
  AKT activity, and the activation of AKT inhibits AMPK signaling. Both signaling
  pathways can be involved in BC progression by regulating energy metabolism. PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3- kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  HK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; LKB1, liver kinase B1; ACC, acetylâ€‘ CoA carboxylase.
