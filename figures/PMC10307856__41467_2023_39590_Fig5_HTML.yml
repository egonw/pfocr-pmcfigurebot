figure_title: Expression of major proteins of the different pathways of glucose metabolism
  in the heart apex
caption: 'a Hierarchical clustering with all proteins of interest involved in different
  pathways of glucose metabolism in the heart apex, based on Pearson correlation on
  z-scored quantification values. Heatmap indicating proteins involved in glycolysis,
  glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway, and polyol pathway in the LV apical segment. Colors depict the z-scored
  changes in protein expression at 2 h and 7d post-ISO respective to baseline expression
  levels: red, overexpression higher than 1.3-fold, green: under-expression lower
  than −1.3-fold. All values are statistically significant with p < 0.05 using two-tailed
  Student’s t-test, n = 5 per time point. b Western blot analysis of Gfat1 (0 vs.
  7d: p = 0.0168, and 2 h vs. 7d: p = 0.0238), Gfat2 (0 vs. 2 h: p = 0.0486, and 0
  vs. 7d: p = 0.0112) represented in boxplots showing median, 25 and 75 percentiles,
  and extremes of values (a.u.: arbitrary units) depicted a significant increase of
  their expression at 2 h and 7d post ISO. The levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins (i.e.,
  the effect of the HBP overactivation), were significantly increased at 7d post-ISO
  compared to the control groups (p = 0.0118); unpaired comparison tests: *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) for each variable
  was estimated by one-way or two-way ANOVA when group variances were equal (Bartlett
  test); if not the non-parametric Kruskall–Wallis test, and the Holm multiple comparisons
  test was used to execute simultaneous t-tests. Source data are provided as a « SourceData_Figure4_WB
