caption: Modulatory effects of HPL-MSCs on the phenotype of macrophages, measured
  at the protein expression level. (A) Schematic diagram of Transwell co-cultivation.
  (B) The levels of (Ba) IL-6 and (Bb) TNF-α were measured with ELISA. (Bc) NO kit
  was utilized to measure the release of NO. (C) IL-10 concentration was measured
  with ELISA. (D) IRF5 protein concentration was measured by Western blot analysis.
  (E) Western blot analysis was also used to detect the expression of IL-1β. (F) The
  expression of CD11b in the cell surface was detected by flow cytometry. The x-axis
  represents the fluorescence signal value and the y-axis represents Counts. The experiments
  were representative of at least three independent trials, each with three technical
  replicates. The error bars represent the standard deviations. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001. MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; HPL, human placenta-derived; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NO, nitric oxide; IRF5, interferon
  regulatory factor 5; CD, cluster of differentiation.
