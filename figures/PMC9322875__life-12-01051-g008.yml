caption: The phenypropanoid biosynthesis pathway analysis in RNA-Seq. The grey columns
  with black squares represent drought stress, while white columns with black circles
  represent CK treatment. The different lowercase letters above the columns show significant
  differences (Î± = 0.05, LSD). (A) Schematic diagram of phenypropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway, the red boxes represent upregulated modules while green boxes represented
  downregulated modules, the blue boxes represent upregulated and downregulated DEGs;
  (B) The expression profile of DEGs in modules enriched in pathways, the color from
  blue to red represent the expression from low to high; (C) The lignin content analysis
  under CK and drought treatments; (D) The activities of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase
  (CAD) analysis under CK and drought treatments.
