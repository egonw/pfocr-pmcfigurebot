caption: Calcium channel blockers impair prosurvival ERK signaling and improve gemcitabine
  sensitivity in vitro. (A) Excisional biopsies from 36 PDAC patients were sectioned
  and stained via immunohistochemistry for LTCCs and representative images are shown
  for each from either chemotherapy-naïve patients (n = 18) or patients who had received
  neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (n = 18). (B) The percentage of patients
  in each group with LTCC-expressing and non–LTCC-expressing tumors. (C) PANC-1, MiaPaCa-2,
  Capan-1, and ASPC-1 cells were evaluated for LTCC expression by Western blot. (D)
  PANC-1-GR cells were stained for LTCCs by immunofluorescence, showing strong membrane
  localization. (E) PANC-1-GR cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of either
  a DMSO vehicle (1:1,000) or the CCBs nifedipine (5 μM) or amlodipine (5 μM). After
  2 h, cells were challenged with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine, and cell
  viability was evaluated after 48 h by MTT assay. Error bars represent mean ± SEM.
  (F) PANC-1-GR cells were treated similarly and cell death was evaluated by Annexin-FITC
  assay. (G–J) PANC-1-GR cells incubated with either a DMSO control vehicle or amlodipine
  (5 μM) for 24 h. Cells were then collected and evaluated by single-cell RNA sequencing.
  Cell populations were visualized via UMAP scatterplot, transcriptionally distinct
  clusters were identified, and each was subjected to enrichment analysis for cell
  processes identified in , with amlodipine-treated clusters showing significant down-regulation
  of MAPK and ERK signaling. (K and L) Individual genes in the ERK and MAPK gene sets,
  respectively. (M and N) PANC-1-GR cells were treated similarly, and the interaction
  between KRAS and calmodulin was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Cell lysate was
  also evaluated by Western blot for ERK pathway activation. (O and P) MiaPaCa-2 and
  ASPC-1 cells were treated with nifedipine (5 μM) or amlodipine (5 μM), and ERK activation
  was evaluated by Western blot. (Q) Excisional biopsies from two PDAC patients undergoing
  survival resection were cored, sectioned at 250-μm intervals, and cultured ex vivo
  either in a control DMSO vehicle, nifedipine (5 μM), or amlodipine (5 μM). After
  72 h, slice cultures were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained either
  with H&E, via immunohistochemistry for CALM, or dual-stained for CK19 and PCNA.
