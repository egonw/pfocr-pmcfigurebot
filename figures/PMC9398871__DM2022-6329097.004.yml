caption: circCNN2 functions as a ceRNA by competitively sponging miR-184. (a, b) RIP
  assay with gel electrophoresis was conducted to detect the enrichment of circCNN2
  in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). (c) RT-qPCR was used to examine the expression
  of miR-184 in H1703 and H226 cells compared with Beas-2B cell line. (d) RIP assay
  was carried out to evaluate miR-184 enrichment in anti-AGO2 and anti-IgG groups.
  (e) RNA pull down assay was adopted to test the enrichment of miR-184 in Bio-circCNN2-Wt
  and Bio-circCNN2-Wut groups. (f) Luciferase report assays were conducted to evaluate
  the luciferase activity of wild-type or mutant circCNN2 plasmids upon mimics NC
  and miR-184 mimics. (g) RT-qPCR was conducted to examine miR-184 expression in H1703
  and H226 cells after inhibiting circCNN2. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the control group.
