caption: Mechanism of Dex in relieving anxiety caused by sleep deprivation. In this
  study, a mouse model of sleep deprivation was established using an interference
  rod device, which induced anxiety in mice. The mechanism may be related to the activation
  of the P38/MSK1/NFκB signaling pathway in the damaged cortex of SD mice. At the
  same time, microglia are significantly activated and central inflammation ensues
  (the schematic is shown with red arrows). Dexmedetomidine can inhibit the inflammatory
  response, inhibit the activation of the P38/MSK1/NFκB signaling pathway, and finally
  alleviate the anxiety-like behavior of SD mice (the schematic is shown with blue
  lines).
