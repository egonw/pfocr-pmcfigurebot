caption: Peroxisomal lipid synthetic pathway. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolysis
  intermediate, can be converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by triose phosphate
  isomerase (TPI). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzes the conversion
  of DHAP to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P), though both DHAP and G3P are believed to
  be transported to the peroxisomal matrix by peroxisomal membrane protein 2 (PXMP2).
  In peroxisomes GPDH may convert G3P back to DHAP, which subsequently has an acyl
  chain added to its sn-1 carbon by glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT),
  yielding acyl-DHAP. Acyl-DHAP may have its sn-2 carbonyl reduced by PexRAP (Peroxisomal
  Reductase activating PPARγ; encoded by Dhrs7b) to yield lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  or it may have its sn-1 acyl chain replaced by a new sn-1 alkyl chain to yield alkyl-DHAP,
  a reaction catalyzed by alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS). Alkyl-DHAP is
  then reduced by PexRAP to form 1-O-Alkyl-G3P (AGP). LPA and AGP are shuttled to
  the endoplasmic reticulum for formation of diacyl phospholipids and ether-linked
  phospholipids, respectively. Ether lipids may be processed further to generate plasmalogens,
  a subclass of ether lipids with a cis-double bond.
