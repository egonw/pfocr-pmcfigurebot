caption: (A) Ubiquitin–proteasome pathway of protein degradation. In the ubiquitination
  process, there is activation of the carboxyl group of glycine found at the C-terminal
  residues of ubiquitin (Ub), catalyzed by E1 (formation of a thiol-ester bond between
  E1 and ubiquitin), with the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and with the release of one
  PPi molecule. (B) After activated ubiquitin is transferred, by transacylation, to
  the thiol group of the enzyme E2. Then E3 recognizes the protein to be degraded
  and facilitates E2 to transfer the ubiquitin to the protein, with the formation
  of an isopeptide covalent bond between the C-terminal glycine residues of ubiquitin
  and a lysine residue of the protein. (C) From multiple cycles of ubiquitination,
  a polyubiquitinated protein is obtained. In the degradation process, the polyubiquitinated
  proteins are unfolded and recognized by the 26S proteasome, with ATP hydrolysis
  to AMP.
