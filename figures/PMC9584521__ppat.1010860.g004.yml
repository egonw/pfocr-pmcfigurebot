figure_title: Fungicide binding sites in target enzymes and fungicide-induced transcriptional
  changes in FocTR4 persisters
caption: 'A Azole binding site in Candida albicans Erg11 (Ca_ERG11, UniProt ID: P10613),
  Z. tritici Erg11 (Zt_Erg11, UniProt ID: F9XG32), FocTR4 Erg11_1 (Foc_Erg11_1; UniProt
  ID: X0JWG9), FocTR4 Erg11_2 (Foc_Erg11_2, UniProt ID: X0LR56) and FocTR4 Erg11_3
  (Foc_Erg11_3, UniProt ID: X0JM02). Residues known in C. albicans Cyb51, reported
  to bind the azoles posaconazole and oteseconazole [], are shown in red-bold; asterisk
  indicate potential involvement in resistance []; the impact of all residue substitutions
  in the Z. tritici and FocTR4 homologues of Ca_ERG11 was estimated using the SIFT
  server (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/); sequence alignment and determination of
  conserved amino acid exchanges used Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).
  B SDHI-binding site in succinate dehydrogenase subunits of Z. tritici (ZtSdh2, UniProt
  ID: O42772; ZtSdh4, UniProt ID: F9X9V6; ZtSdh3_1, UniProt ID: F9XH52; ZtSdh3_2,
  UniProt ID: F9XLX9 (partial); complete ZtSdh3_2 sequence at FungiDB, https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/record/gene/ZTRI_10.476;)
  and FocTR4 (FocSdh2, UniProt ID: X0JUP8; FocSdh4, UniProt ID: X0JC07; FocSdh3_1,
  UniProt ID: X0JTM7; FocSdh3_2, UniProt ID: X0K132). Residues known in Z. tritici
  and other fungi to bind SDHI molecules [] are shown in red-bold; asterisks indicate
  potential involvement in resistance []; the impact of all residue substitutions
  in FocTR4 homologues was estimated using the SIFT server (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/);
  sequence alignment used Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).
  C Comparison of the amino acid sequence of quinol oxidation (Qo) site of mitochondrial
  cytochrome b in Z. tritici (ZtCytb; UniProt ID: Q6X9S4) and FocTR4 (FocCytb, UniProt
  ID: A0A1A7TD23). Residues known to bind strobilurin molecules are shown in red-bold;
  asterisks indicate potential involvement in resistance; the impact of all residue
  substitutions in FocTR4 was estimated using the SIFT server (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/);
  sequence alignment used Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).
  Note that all substitutions in FocCytb are predicted to be of low impact ("tolerated").
  Information on strobilurin molecule-interacting (Cpd-interacting) and resistance-conferring
  residues from [,]. D Venn diagram showing numbers of FocTR4 genes, up-regulated
  significantly (>5-fold) in the presence of fungicides. Note that a transcription
  factor (UniProt ID: X0JJ38) and an ABC transporter (UniProt ID: X0JJA9) are up-regulated
  in all conditions. E Number of up-regulated genes in FocTR4 persister cells, putatively
  involved in providing fungicide tolerance. Putative detoxifying enzymes (red), efflux
  transporter and pumps (green) and proteins involved in the targeted cellular pathway
  (blue) that are significantly upregulated (P<0.05) in epoxiconazole, fluxapyroxad
  and azoxystrobin-persisters are included. F Regulation of FocTR4 mitochondrial respiration
  complex subunits in the presence of 500 μg ml-1 azoxystrobin. Dotted green line
  indicates non-significant difference to methanol-treated control cells. Median of
  expression of nucleus-encoded subunits (red) is indicated by black lines. Data shown
  in (D) were derived from RNA-preparations of cells, grown for 2 days in medium,
  supplemented with 3 μg ml-1 epoxiconazole, 500 μg ml-1 azoxystrobin or 500 μg ml-1
  fluxapyroxad.'
