caption: Biological processes and signaling pathways enriched by the low-density neutrophil
  (LDN) clusters in Omicron convalescents. a UMAP plots showing the cell clusters
  of LDNs from convalescents after mild to moderate Omicron infection (n = 5 for mild
  and n = 13 for moderate) and healthy donors (n = 6) using data of WTA scRNA-seq.
  b Dot plot depicting the differential expression genes by all the LDN clusters.
  c AUcell plots showing the enrichment on the production and responses to the signaling
  pathways of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by all the LDN clusters. d AUcell
  plots showing the enrichment on the cell response to IFN pathway by all the LDN
  clusters. e AUcell plots showing the enrichment on the processes of innate immune
  defense and tissue remodeling by all the LDN clusters. f Dot plot depicting the
  expression of genes enriched on the biological process and signaling pathways described
  above by the LDN clusters
