caption: 'The IGF2-KCC2 pathway regulates the aftereffect of the ZT0-4 TRF on locomotion
  changes(A) Two representative actograms of control (n = 7), IGF2 inhibitor-Chromeceptin
  (n = 7) and IGF1R inhibitor-GSK1904529A (n = 5) treated mice that were administered
  with 1 week of TRF entrainment and Chromeceptin (n = 5) treated mice with cage changes.(B)
  Statistical analysis of locomotion range under DD in control, IGF2R inhibitor GSK1904529A,
  IGF2 inhibitor Chromeceptin-treated TRF-entrained mice and Chromeceptin-treated
  mice without TRF.(C) A mixture of AAV-VGAT-Cre and AAV with Cre inducible EGFP and
  IGF2 was injected into the SCN of wild-type mice. Two representative actograms of
  locomotors in SCN GABAergic neurons EGFP-overexpressing control (n = 4) and IGF2-overexpressing
  mice (n = 4). All mice were entrained under LD for 2 weeks and then released to
  DD for 2 weeks. The AAV injection site (green) was also verified by SCN slices.
  (Scale bar: 100 μm).(D) Statistics of the locomotion range for EGFP- and IGF2- overexpressing
  mice.(E) The Kcc2 mRNA expression in rat SCN 2.2 cells administered with PBS, a
  low concentration of IGF2 (IGF2-L, 5 ng/mL), a moderate concentration of IGF2 (IGF2-M,
  50 ng/mL) and a high concentration of IGF2 (IGF2-H, 500 ng/mL).(F) The working model
  of the effect of ZT0-4 TRF on SCN. ZT0-4 TRF affects the SCN plasticity by regulating
  Igf2 signaling and thereby ion transport Kcc2, and finally influence the circadian
  output such as the neuron Ca2+ rhythm, sleep-wake cycle and locomotion range. Values
  represent the average ±SD， ∗: p < 0.05, ∗∗∗: p < 0.001, ns: not significant. All
  p values are from two-tailed Student’s t-tests. See also .'
