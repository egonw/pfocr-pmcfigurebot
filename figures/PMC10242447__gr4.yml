caption: TI characteristics of four monocyte subpopulations(A and B) The number of
  up- and downregulated TIGs in each subpopulation. The results of pathway enrichment
  analysis using up- and downregulated TIGs identified in (A), separately, are summarized
  in (B). See also C–S4F. Pathways in the pink area were upregulated and in the blue
  area downregulated. IFN-γ pathways were upregulated in TM1 but downregulated in
  TM2.(C and D) Comparisons of the number of shared and unique TIGs in high and low
  responders in each population. The results of enrichment analysis (C) using specific
  up- and downregulated TIGs in high and low responders, separately, are summarized
  in (D). Pathways in the pink area were upregulated and in the blue area downregulated.
  Interestingly, IFN-γ pathways were upregulated in TM1 in high responders but were
  downregulated in TM2 in low responders. This again indicated the importance of IFN-γ
  pathways in TI and the role of these pathways in explaining individual diversity
  in responding to TI. See also C–S5H and A–S6D.(E) Further investigation comparing
  monocytes and CD8+ T cells explored communications between four monocyte subpopulations
  and CD8+ T cells. The expression level of the top 20 most active ligands identified
  in four subpopulations are shown as a dot plot. Different ligands were interacting
  with CD8+ T cells in each subpopulation, and TM1 was the most active cell type.
  Heatmap shows the potential regulatory relationship between ligands in monocyte
  subpopulations and TIGs in CD8+ T cells. See also E–S6G.
