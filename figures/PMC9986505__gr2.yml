caption: In silico PHENSIM prediction of host transcriptional response to SARS-Cov-2.In
  vitro results from Blanco-Melo et al. (left column; checkered boxes) are compared
  to in silico PHENSIM predictions (right; solid) for all evaluated respiratory related
  cells assessed; NHBE, Calu-3, A549 cells at low (0.2) and high (2.0) MOI, ± ACE2
  transduction respectively. A) Heatmap depicting the perturbation of a select subset
  of anti-viral, ISGs and inflammatory genes. B) Heatmaps depicting unbiased analysis
  of the top-10 upregulated (red) and top-10 downregulated (blue) DEGs from Blanco-Melo
  et al. (left) with side-by-side PHENSIM predictions (right). For A&B, legend shows
  denoted perturbations for PHENSIM prediction and Blanco-Melo et al. See legend box
  for DEG annotation. C) Heatmap depicts whole genome pathway analysis as predicted
  by PHENSIM for a select set of signaling pathways of interest in all assessed cell
  types. Pathway selection was based on highlighted pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2
  infection. Color gradient depicts the average pathway perturbation as predicted
  in our PHENSIM in silico experiments. D&E) MITHrIL pathway analysis was used to
  assess top meta-pathways for D) A549-ACE2 MOI 0.2 (low viral load) and E) A549-ACE2
  MOI 2.0 (high viral load), according to impact (circle size) and significance (color-gradient
  for adjusted p-value) for the top 12 up- (+accumulator) and down-regulated pathways.
  The accumulator is the accumulation/sum of all perturbations computed for that particular
  pathway. NHBE; Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial cells, Calu-3; Cultured human airway
  epithelial cells, A549; Transformed lung alveolar cells, ACE2; angiotensin-converting
  enzyme, MOI; multiplicity of infection. DEGs; Differentially expressed genes, ISGs;
  IFN-stimulated genes.
