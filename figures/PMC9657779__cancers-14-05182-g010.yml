caption: Proposed Model for S1P-mediated pro-survival/anti-ICD signaling. According
  to our results, ER membrane localized Bak/Bax activation occurs upstream of Caspase
  8 activation within the “canonical” ICD pathway. ABT/AZD at high concentrations
  can directly induce ER lumenal Ca2+ depletion and activate Caspase 8 leading to
  ectoCRT exposure and ICD. At lower, non-cytotoxic concentrations of ABT/AZD, ER
  membrane localized Bak/Bax induced Caspase 8 activation is counter-balanced by Bak/Bax
  induced activation of IRE1α kinase activity. IRE1α phosphorylates SphK1 at Ser225
  to enhance its catalytic activity above basal levels. SphK1, localized to the cytosolic
  face of the ER membrane, interacts with TRAF2 and produces S1P locally to activate
  TRAF2 K63 ubiquitin ligase activity to polyubiquitinate c-FLIP. K63-Ub c-FLIP serves
  as the substrate for M1 linear ubiquitination, by LUBAC, which stabilizes c-FLIP
  and inhibits Caspase 8 activity. Thus, induction of ectoCRT dimerization, cell surface
  exposure and ICD are inhibited. Inhibition of SphK1 activity using SKIs such as
  PF-543 (among others) blocks S1P production and TRAF2 activation leading to c-FLIP
  degradation/depletion. Caspase 8 auto-activates leading to ectoCRT dimerization/exposure
  and ICD.
