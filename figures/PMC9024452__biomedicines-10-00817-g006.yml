caption: 'Possible mechanisms activated in PBMCs isolated from individuals with LTBI.
  (1) After the initial infection, the bacilli reach the lungs and are recognized
  by alveolar macrophages. (2) In most infected individuals, the bacilli are contained
  in structures called granulomas. (3) PBMCs are recruited to the site of infection.
  (4) Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces several virulence factors for cell survival,
  including ESAT-6, which interacts with toll-like receptor 2, activates proinflammatory
  cytokines, and modulates IL-15-mediated activation of vitamin-D-dependent antimicrobial
  pathways. (5) The NF-κB pathway activates transcription factors, such as A20, which
  is involved in negative feedback inhibition of NF-κB, and HIF-1α, the central regulator
  of the hypoxic response. (6) Inhibition of HIF-1α results in decreased phosphorylation
  of NF-κB but increased production of TNF-α, bypassing NF-κB and HIF-1α pathways.
