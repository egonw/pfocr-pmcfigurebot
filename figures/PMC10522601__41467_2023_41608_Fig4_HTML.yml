figure_title: Cellular communication landscape between immune cells and cutaneous
  cells
caption: a Schematic timeline highlighting the recruitment of immune cells from innate
  and adaptive immune systems in Ctrl_LW (top) and ECM_LW (bottom) groups. b Comparison
  of overall cell-cell interaction numbers of immune cells and cutaneous cells between
  Ctrl_LW and ECM_LW using CellChat. c The ligand–receptor pairs up-regulated in the
  Ctrl_LW group in specificity between AIM1 and fibroblasts (MF1, RF1, and LF1). d
  The ligand–receptor pairs up-regulated in the ECM_LW group in specificity between
  Treg1, MAC (Mono1, PIM1, AIM1), and HFSC1. e Spatial feature plots and corresponding
  violin plots showed the expression level of the ligand and cognate receptor in the
  Notch signaling pathway.
