caption: Results of differential analysis, Cluster 3 (“Non-Responsive|Immunosuppressive”)
  vs. Cluster 1 (“Responsive”). (A) All differentially expressed genes, with adj.
  p-value < 0.05 and |LFC| > 0.50, with genes of interest highlighted. (B) Pathway
  enrichment analysis for Cluster 3, performed using ENRICHR. Enriched pathways found
  using differentially expressed genes within Cluster 3. * denotes statistical significant
  (p < 0.05) (C) Presence of differentially expressed genes within significantly enriched
  pathway sets. (D) Network analysis using three foundational pathway sets.
