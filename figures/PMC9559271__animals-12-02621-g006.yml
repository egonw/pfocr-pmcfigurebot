caption: Integrated analysis of the expressions of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) and metabolites in control vs. SARA. (A) Pearson correlation analysis of
  the expressions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites (TOP15).
  Red indicates a positive correlation, blue indicates a negative correlation, and
  deeper colors indicate stronger correlations. (B) Part of choline metabolism in
  cancer. (C) Drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 pathway. (D) D-Glutamine and D-glutamate
  metabolism pathways. The round nodes are metabolites and the square nodes are the
  enzymes corresponding to the transcripts. The expression fold changes of metabolites
  from low to high are represented by blue to yellow colors, and the expression fold
  changes of transcripts from low to high are represented by green to red colors.
