caption: Anticancer effects exerted by Statins by inhibiting mevalonate pathway. Acetyl-CoA,
  the byproduct of glycolysis, is converted into mevalonate, IPP, GPP, FPP, GGPP,
  and cholesterol through a series of enzymatic processes that make up the mevalonate
  pathway. FPP and GGPP may both be supplemented to proteins post-translationally,
  particularly minor monomeric GTPases such as Ras predominantly part of MAPK/ERK
  pathway responsible for inducing VEGF expression in colorectal cancer. The inhibitory
  effect of FPP on MAPK/ERK pathway and inhibition of mevalonate pathway by statins
  causes tumor cell death and prevents migration of tumor cells. Statins shows its
  inhibitory effect on VEGFR and EGFR thus, inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor progression
  in cancer. It also inhibits BCL2 and induces aoptosis of cancerous cells.
