caption: A schematic diagram of different trafficking routes of endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER)‐synthesized proteins ER proteins can be transported to the vacuole, plasma
  membrane or extracellular space through the conserved ER‐to‐Golgi secretory pathway.
  Some storage proteins such as prolamins from cereal plants can form protein bodies
  as an independent organelle in maturing seeds. Precursors of other storage proteins
  form aggregates upon synthesis on the ER and develop into precursor‐accumulating
  (PAC) vesicles for direct trafficking into the protein storage vacuole for further
  processing in a Golgi‐independent manner. Some of these storage protein precursors
  may leave the ER for the Golgi apparatus but are recruited back to the PAC vesicles
  through the action of the vacuolar sorting receptor PV72. Upon synthesis in the
  ER, amino acid sequence KDEL‐tailed Cys proteases are stored in specialized ER‐derived
  vesicles (ERDVs) variously known as precursor protease vesicles (PPVs), ricinosomes
  and KDEL‐tailed Cys protease‐accumulating vesicles (KVs) as inactive proenzymes
  but are activated into mature enzymes after transport to the vacuole to promote
  programmed cell death (PCD). ER bodies from Brassicales accumulate a family of β‐glucosidases
  with a myrosinase activity that can get access to glucosinolates from the vacuole
  upon tissue damage to produce toxic compounds as mustard bombs against herbivores
  and pathogens. PM, plasma membrane; MVB, multivesicular body; TGN, trans‐Golgi network.
