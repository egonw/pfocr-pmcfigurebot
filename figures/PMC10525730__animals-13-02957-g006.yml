caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis comparing the VED and normal groups. Each
  bubble in the diagram depicts a metabolic pathway, and its abscissa and size show
  the degree of the pathway influence variables in the topological analyses. The ordinates
  and colors of the bubbles show the p values (âˆ’ln p-value) of the enrichment test,
  with darker colors indicating a greater level of enrichment.
