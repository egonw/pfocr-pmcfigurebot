caption: Sphingolipid metabolism is regulated by androgen receptor (AR). (A) Bioinformatics
  analysis workflow of prostate cancer patient transcriptomics datasets performed
  with Cancertool to identify metabolic genes correlated with androgen receptor activity.
  (B) KEGG pathways enrichment of AR activity-correlated metabolic genes (AR metabolic
  correlome). (C) Schematic ceramide biosynthetic pathway, adapted from Merscher et
  al. Positively and negatively correlated enzymes are highlighted in red and blue,
  respectively. (D) Heatmap representation of the sphingolipid metabolic genes correlated
  with AR signature in multiple PCa datasets encompassing primary tumors. Red and
  blue color intensity depict the degree of direct and inverse correlation, respectively.
  An asterisk is included when the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.2 or
  lower than âˆ’0.2 with a p-value lower than 0.05.
