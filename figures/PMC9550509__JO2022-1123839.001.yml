caption: 'FAM201A was highly expressed in CC and enriched in CC cell cytoplasm, and
  its expression was negatively correlated with miR-1271-5p. (a) The expression of
  FAM201A was analyzed in the TCGA-CESC database, including CC samples (n = 306) and
  normal samples (n = 13) by GEPIA. (b, c, f, g) The expressions of FAM201A (b, f)
  and miR-1271-5p (c, g) in CC tissues and the adjacent normal tissues (b, c) as well
  as in HeLa, C33a, SiHa, ME180 and human endocervical epithelial HCerEpiC cells (f,
  g) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (d) The correlation between FAM201A and miR-1271-5p
  in CC tissues was analyzed by Pearson''s correlation tests. (e) The expression of
  FAM201A in CC tissues and the adjacent normal tissues was assessed by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (magnification: ×200; scale: 100 μm). (h, i) The subcellular
  localization of FAM201A was determined by qRT-PCR. (j, k) The expression of FAM201A
  in SiHa cells and ME180 cells was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization
  (magnification: ×200; scale: 100 μm). ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001; # vs. HCerEpiC.
