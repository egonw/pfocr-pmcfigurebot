caption: Diagram of the mechanism by which mTOR influences NAFLD based on the intestinal
  flora, autophagy, inflammation, genetic polymorphisms, and epigenetics. (a). LPS
  in the blood regulates the TLR family through the gut–liver axis, the intestinal
  flora and ghrelin, thus polarizing macrophages towards the proinflammatory M1 phenotype,
  inhibiting constitutively active Rictor in mTORC2 by releasing miR-192-5P from autophagic
  vesicles and ultimately affecting liver inflammation (via TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10,
  etc.). (b). mTORC1, as the center of autophagy regulation, is closely associated
  with AMPK, TXINP, and the ULK1 and VPS34 complexes, and can affect liver inflammation
  through TFEB and eLF4E. (c). Akt and PI3K, which are upstream of mTORC1, are closely
  associated with genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic modification of WNK, OSR1,
  and EGFR-3′-UTR (SNP). DNMT3A and SQLE are key genes in the mTORC1-mediated NF-KB
  pathway that are regulated by genetic polymorphisms and epigenetics. (d). mTORC1
  directly regulates S6K1 and phosphorylates Lipin-1 to inhibit SREBP-1 and influence
  PPAR, a key gene in OS. (e). mTORC1 can directly inhibit PPAR-α-mediated fatty acid
  metabolism and thus inhibit OS.
