caption: Contribution of PTPμ and NELL2 to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. NELL2 contributes
  to the activation of ERK1/2 while PTPμ inhibits its activation through dephosphorylation.
  In our T cell-enriched psoriatic skin substitutes, NELL2 expression was upregulated,
  whereas that of PTPμ was decreased, both resulting in an overactivation of the ERK1/2
  signaling pathway.
