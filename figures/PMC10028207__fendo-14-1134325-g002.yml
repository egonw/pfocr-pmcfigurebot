caption: Identification of DKD subtypes. (A) Venn diagram showing the intersection
  of oxidative stress and inflammation-related genes (OS_Infla) and DEGs. (B) Consensus
  matrix when k was 2. (C) Consensus distribution function (CDF) when K was between
  2 and 9. (D, E) Relative changes in the area under the CDF curve for k = 2 to 9.
  (F) Expression heatmap of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammatory response
  among C1 and C2 subtypes and normal samples. (G) A gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) of the status of biological pathways in two DKD subtypes. (H) The mountain
  graph showing the differences in DKD characteristic pathway scores among C1 subtype,
  C2 subtype, and normal samples. (Kruskal–Wallis test, ****P < 0.001, ***P < 0.005,
  *P < 0.05).
