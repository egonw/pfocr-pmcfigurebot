caption: COMMD3 expression and protein level after COMMD3-overexpression or COMMD3-knockdown
  in HCC cell lines. (a–b) Relative quantity of COMMD3 mRNA level in SK-Hep1 and Hep-3B
  cell lines measured by RT-qPCR after COMMD3 overexpression or knockdown. (c–d) COMMD3
  protein levels increased after COMMD3-overexpressed transfection. (h–g) COMMD3 protein
  levels decreased after COMMD3-knockdown transfection. (e–f) Western blot of COMMD3
  levels. Actin was used as the loading control. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P <
  0.001.
