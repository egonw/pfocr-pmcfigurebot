caption: The effects and blockade of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling by anakinra. Severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the epithelial
  cells of the lungs and destruction of cells leads to IL-1α release, which in turn
  recruits neutrophils and monocytes and promotes IL-1β release from monocytes/macrophages.
  Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 directly leads to IL-1β release from monocytes/macrophages
  and neutrophils. Both IL-1α and IL-1β bind to IL-1 receptors. Accordingly, MyD88,
  IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) are
  phosphorylated. NFκB stimulates the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Anakinra
  blocks IL-1 receptors and inhibits the binding of IL-1α and IL-1β, thus preventing
  the signaling pathway. DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; MOF, multiple
  organ failure.
