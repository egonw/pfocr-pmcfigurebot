caption: A networks-based model and permutation test (BiG-BETS) are superior to univariate
  model(A) Percentage of genes that are significant (with multiple test correction)
  using MWU test (left two bars) and significant by the networks-based test (right
  two bars). Differences between DDR and non-DDR genes computed were assessed with
  chi-squared test with p value shown above the corresponding bars; n.s., not significant.(B)
  Distribution of BiG-BETS Z scores for the DDR genes. Low versus high Z score DDR
  genes are defined using Z score < 0 and Z score > 0 (dashed vertical line), respectively,
  with individual genes in each bin listed about the plot.(C) Application of bipartite
  configuration test to the DDR pathways in the TCGA data. Each subplot shows the
  observed cumulative distribution of TMB for samples with a mutation in the genes
  of the specified pathway by the red solid line. The blue line shows the average
  cumulative distribution across 400 sampled networks, with the light blue band showing
  the 99% confidence interval (CI). Horizontal line at y = 0.5 denotes the median
  TMB for the distributions. Inset figures show a histogram of the means of the sampled
  distributions of TMB for samples with a mutation in the corresponding DDR pathway.
  The vertical red dashed line within the inset depicts the observed mean TMB in the
  actual dataset. Z scores were constructed by comparing the observed mean TMB with
  the sampled means.(D) Significant gene ontology (GO) terms identified in the 50
  lowest BiG-BET genes from the pan-TCGA dataset. p values corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg.
