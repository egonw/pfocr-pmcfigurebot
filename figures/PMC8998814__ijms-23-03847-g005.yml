caption: Activation and downstream targets of P38 MAPK. P38 MAPK is activated through
  several mechanisms. The canonical MAPK signaling module involves sequential phosphorylation
  and activation events that pass down from MAP3Ks to MAP2Ks, and from MAP2Ks to P38
  MAPK. In response to various external stresses and signals (e.g., oxidative stress,
  UV irradiation, DNA-damage chemotherapeutic agents, and cytokines), several MAP3Ks
  can trigger activation of P38 signaling, such as TAK1, MEKK1-4, MLK2/3, and ASK1/2.
  Three MAP2Ks, namely MKK3, MKK6, and MKK4, are direct upstream activators of P38
  MAPK. In addition to canonical activation, P38a, the best-characterized member of
  the P38 kinase family, can also be activated through autophosphorylation. P38 MAPK
  has been reported to phosphorylate more than 100 proteins, highlighting the versatility
  of this signaling pathway. Prominent downstream targets include transcription factors,
  protein kinases, and phosphatases, growth factor receptors, as well as key regulators
  of cell cycle and apoptosis (depicted in the main text of the article). Based on
