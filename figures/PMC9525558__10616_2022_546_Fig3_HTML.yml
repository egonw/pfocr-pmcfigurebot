caption: 'KDM1A overexpression regulated T24 cell H3K4 histone methylation, proliferation,
  apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the unfolded protein response depending on its
  demethylase activity. Groups of T24 cells were separately transfected with the KDM1A
  overexpression plasmid (WT), catalytically inactive KDM1A overexpression plasmid
  (MUT) or corresponding empty vector. A KDM1A expression was detected by qRT-PCR
  and western blotting, B H3K4 histone di-methylation levels were detected by ELISA
  and western blotting, C and D CCK-8 assays and Edu staining were used to assess
  effects on cell proliferation (red indicates a Edu-positive signal and blue indicates
  nuclei stained with DAPI), E The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected
  by western blotting, F Apoptosis was detected by Tunel staining (red indicates a
  Tunel-positive signal and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI), G The levels
  of SOD and MDA were detected by ELISA, H The expression of UPR pathway-related proteins
  was detected by western blotting. *** P < 0.001, vs. vector, ### P < 0.001, vs.
