caption: Activation of the complement cascade in diabetes, leading to diabetic kidney
  disease. In diabetes, the classical and the MBL pathways have been shown to be activated
  with the increased deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys and increased autoreactivity
  to MBL due to accelerated protein glycation, respectively. However, evidence for
  the activation of the alternative pathway is less clear in diabetic kidney disease.
  Increased glycation of regulatory protein, CD59, leads to a reduced inhibitory action
  on MAC in diabetes, exacerbating complement auto-attack. Increase in complement
  activation leads to the production of anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, which act on
  their respective receptors, C3aR and C5aR1, and result in the production of ROS,
  inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors, such as TGF-β, MCP-1, IL-1, IL-16, and
  TNF, which are mediators of renal fibrosis and inflammation in diabetic kidney disease.
  IL, interleukin; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. Color
  images are available online.
