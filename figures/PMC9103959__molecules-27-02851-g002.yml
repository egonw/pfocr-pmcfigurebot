caption: The effects of compounds on cell viability (A) and nitrite content (B). BV2
  cells were incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of compounds 1–4. Cell
  viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide assay. BV2 cells were pretreated for 3 h with indicated concentrations of
  compounds and stimulated for 24 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.5 μg/mL). Bars
  represent means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. *** p < 0.001
  compared with LPS-treated group.
