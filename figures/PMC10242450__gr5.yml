caption: BV-associated bacterial supernatants affect vaginal epithelial barrier function
  in vitro and affect pathways involved in mTOR activity and epithelial function(A)
  Heatmap showing differentially abundant proteins in VK2 cells treated with different
  bacterial culture supernatants for 24 h, as observed by mass spectrometry. Proteins
  that activate mTOR cluster in the group that is upregulated in BV-associated bacterial
  treated cells (red box). Numerous structural and signaling adherens proteins were
  also differentially regulated by BV-associated bacteria (highlighted in green).(B)
  Pathway analysis showing top pathways including wound healing, tissue remodeling,
  and mTOR activation.(C) G. vaginalis inhibited VK2 cell differentiation and thickness
  compared with L. crispatus (n = 9).(D) G. vaginalis inhibited wound-healing ability
  as measured by scratch assay in Hec1a cells (n = 9).(E) M. mulieris decreased barrier
  integrity as measured by electrical resistance (TEER) on transwell membranes of
  Hec1a cells (n = 12).(F) M. mulieris induced a leaky barrier with protein-sized
  particles (dextran-FITC, 70 kDa) able to translocate across the membrane, but not
  larger-sized particles (n = 6).All error bars represent standard deviation from
  the mean, p values represent unpaired t test results. See also .
