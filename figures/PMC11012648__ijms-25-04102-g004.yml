caption: 'Therapeutic targets in the HH signaling pathway. Hedgehog ligands bind to
  Patched on the surface of target cells, relieving Patched-mediated inhibition of
  Smoothened. Activated Smoothened leads to activation of the Gli family of transcription
  factor, which promotes the expression of target genes. PTCH: Patched, SMO: smoothened,
  GLI1: Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1.'
