caption: The process and molecular functions of m7G modification in RNA metabolism.
  Different methyltransferases were essential for introducing internal m7G modification
  and cap m7G modification at 5’-termial in human, including METTL1/WDR4, RNMT/RAM,
  WBSC22 and TGS1, relative locations are marked with numbers. In the nucleus, m7G-cap
  could be recognized by CBC to generate RNA nuclear exportation. In the cytoplasm,
  the binding of TMG-cap and Snuportin1 associated with importin-β enables RNA to
  be imported into the nucleus. m7G regulates RNA degradation by maintaining RNA geometry
  structure and protecting RNAs from 5’ exonucleases and RTD pathway. m7G promotes
  RNA maturation by affecting secondary structures. m7G regulates mRNA translation
  through eIF4E recognition, interference of ribosome pausing and tRNA decoding.
