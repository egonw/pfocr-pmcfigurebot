caption: Overview of mTORC1-related protein synthesis pathways. Multiple signaling
  cascades converge on mTORC1 and contribute to protein translation. Cytosolic leucine
  and arginine relieve inhibition on GATOR2 by Sestrin2 and CASTOR1, respectively,
  and subsequently promote mTORC1-induced protein synthesis via GATOR2–GATOR1–Rag
  signaling. Mechanical stress causes Cγ1 to colocalize around FAK, catalyzing Ptdlns(4,5)P2
  conversion to PA, and subsequently activates the HIPPO pathway (YAP and TAZ). Filamin-C
  and Bag3 interaction also activates the HIPPO pathway. The HIPPO pathway promotes
  mTORC1 signaling via the suppression of PTEN. The PI3K–Akt–TSC signaling cascade
  regulates mTORC1 signaling via Rheb, although Akt can directly promote mTORC1 signaling
  via PRAS40. AMPK and REDD1 inhibit mTORC1 via TSC; AMPK can also inhibit mTORC1
  directly via Raptor. mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis by activating several translational
  and ribosomal components, and Ras–MEK–ERK 1/2 signaling converges on common factors.
