caption: 'RBG inhibits the malignant characteristics of MM cells. (A) Cell viability
  and IC50 was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) Apoptosis was measured
  using flow cytometry. (C) Cell migration was measured using a Transwell assay. (D)
  Cell invasion was measured using a Transwell assay (x400 magnification). (E) Protein
  expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin was detected using western blotting.
  RPMI8226 cells were treated with different concentrations of RBG (2, 4 and 8 µM).
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs.
  RBG (2 µM); &P<0.05, &&P<0.01 and &&&P<0.001 vs. RBG (4 µM). RBG, resibufogenin.'
