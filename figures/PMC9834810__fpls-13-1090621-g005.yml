caption: The ASE gene MdFLS2 may affect the defense response of apple leaves to AAAP.
  (A) Venn diagram analysis of “core” immune DEGs and ASEGs. (B) Heatmap showing log2FPKM
  of six “core” immune ASEGs in HFTH1 and HF at 12, 24, and 48 h after AAAP inoculation.
  (C) Heatmap sequentially shows the log2Fold change of genes from MdFLS2-related
  pathway in HF compared with HFTH1 at 12, 24, and 48 h after AAAP inoculation.
article_title: Insertion of a TRIM-like sequence in MdFLS2-1 promoter is associated
  with its allele-specific expression in response to Alternaria alternata in apple.
