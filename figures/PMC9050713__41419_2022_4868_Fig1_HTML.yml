figure_title: TAK-228 disrupts the apoptotic signaling pathway and oxidative stress
  response in AT/RT
caption: A Volcano plot of the combined data over all cell models illustrates the
  impact of 4 h of TAK-228 20 nM treatment on gene expression. Genes included with
  FDR cutoff <0.1 and >25% change in expression. B Principal component analysis of
  gene expression profiles. Hexagons below the dashed line represent DMSO control-treated
  cells. Circles above the line represent TAK-228-treated cells. C Panther pathway
  analysis on genes downregulated after TAK-228 treatment identified signaling pathways
  most significantly disrupted by TAK-228 treatment. D Heatmap shows the most divergently
  expressed genes related to the apoptotic signaling pathway between DMSO and TAK-228-treated
  cells. Blue represents minimal expression and red maximum. RNASeq values normalized
  to the average value of the DMSO-treated samples in each cell model. E Western blot
  for anti-apoptotic proteins 24 h after TAK-228 20 nM treatment. Numbers above blots
  represent quantification of protein expression normalized to ACTIN. F Relative expression
  of MCL-1 as determined by quantification of western blots 24 h after TAK-228 treatment.
  MCL-1 expression is normalized to ACTIN and expressed as a ratio to DMSO control.
  G RT-PCR probing for pro-apoptotic genes DDIT3, BOK, and NOXA1 24 h after TAK-228.
  Significance measured in comparison with DMSO control. H Expression of pro-apoptotic
  genes 24 h after treatment with the mTOR/PI3K inhibitors TAK-228, KU-0063794, and
  Paxalisib dosed at the IC50 in CHLA06. Significance as compared with DMSO control.
  Results in this figure are presented as the mean +/− SEM, *p < 0.05 **p < 0.005,
  t-test.
