caption: Classification of DE genes in NC and RP. (A) Numbers, volcano plot, Venn
  diagram, and heatmap of DE miRNAs. (B) Numbers, volcano plot, Venn diagram, and
  heatmap of DE mRNAs. The abscissa and ordinate of the heatmap are samples and genes,
  respectively. The colors from red to white represent the miRNA expression levels
  [log10 (relative expression levels + 1) and Z-score] from high to low. The colors
  from blue to white represent the mRNA expression levels [log10 (relative expression
  levels) and Z-score] from high to low. DE, differentially expressed; FC, fold-change;
  NC, fetal membranes of normal discharge; RP, retained placenta.
article_title: miRNA-150_R-1 mediates the HIF-1/ErbB signaling pathway to regulate
  the adhesion of endometrial epithelial cells in cows experiencing retained placenta.
