caption: Comparing the results from RECQ1 and ERα ChIP-seq revealed significant co-occupancy
  of these proteins in MCF7 cells genome-wide. Transcriptomic analyses in control
  versus RECQ1 KD cells revealed estrogen response as the major RECQ1-regulated pathway
  in MCF7 cells. Integrating the results of RECQ1 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq identified
  a subset of RECQ1-regulated genes in MCF7 cells. We utilized siRNA knockdown for
  transcriptome analysis in our original study but the functions of RECQ1 (or other
  RecQ protein) can also be investigated following shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
  knockout in cell lines.
