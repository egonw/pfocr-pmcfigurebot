caption: Effect of TCS on mitochondrial membrane potential in Neuro-2a cells. The
  cells were treated with DMSO (control), CCCP (positive control), and TCS (10, 30
  and 50 µM) for 24 h. Representative fluorescent microscopic image showing the loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells stained with JC-1 fluorescent probe.
  The images were captured at 200x magnification (scale bar, 92 µm). All experiments
  were performed three times independently and image quantification was performed
  with the help of ImageJ software with mean ± SEM and shown as bar graph. * indicates
  p < 0.05 as compared to control cells in green fluorescent group. TCS, triclosan;
  CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophynylhydrazone.
