caption: Among the miRNA gene targets, three cellular pathways showed significant
  enrichment (p < 0.05). These pathways are the cell cycle, Hippo, and TGF-β (transforming
  growth factor β) signaling pathways. The size axis indicates the number of genes
  significantly associated with each pathway. As depicted, SMAD4 (SMAD family member
  4) is the only gene present in all three signaling pathways (A). The protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network constructed for the proteins in these three signaling
  pathways showed that PPP1CB (protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta), INCENP
  (inner centromere protein), and MRPS15 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S15) exhibited
  the highest degree, indicating a greater number of interactions with other proteins
  in the network (B). Bar charts visualize the distribution of enriched GO (Gene Ontology)
  terms and identify clusters of related genes (C). This suggests that the miRNAs
  targeted by circPSEN1s regulate several cellular pathways, potentially influencing
  various biological processes and signaling cascades.
