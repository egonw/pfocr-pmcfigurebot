caption: 'Proposed mechanism by which hierarchical secretion of identified secretome
  proteins may lead to the progression from grade I and II to grade III breast cancer
  Proteins in bold belong to the overlapping protein cluster as shown in . Blue cell
  (grade I and II, Cluster 1) interactions: LAMB1-3, LAMC1, COL7A, and AGRN interactions
  with ITGB1 [,]. Downstream activation of JNK and ERK cascades through ITGB1 [,].
  Parallel activation of the ERK cascade by EGF-EGFR interaction []. FBN1 interaction
  with VEGFR1 and downstream STAT2 activation []. BMP interaction with BMPR and subsequent
  activation of SMAD 1/5/8 []. Downstream effectors of JNK and ERK cascade []. Brown
  cell (grade III, cluster 2) interactions: HSPG2 and LOXL2 interaction with IGFB3
  [,]. Laminin protein family interaction with MET and ITGB1 [,]. ACTG1 interaction
  with THBS1, LTBP1, fibronectin, and LOXL to drive SDC4 phosphorylation and subsequent
  WNT pathway activation [,,,,]. LDLR laminin interaction and internalization leads
  to PCSK9 activation and tumor microenvironment promotion []. VEGFA-VEGFR2 interaction
  promotes the ERK cascade activation []. IGFBP-3, fibrillin, and ERK cascade leads
  activation of TGF-beta [,]. Integrin-beta1-dependent activation of MET []. mTOR
  downstream effectors []. TGFÎ² genetic targets []. Wnt and b-catenin downstream genetic
  targets []. Image created with BioRender.com. Protein name abbreviations stated
