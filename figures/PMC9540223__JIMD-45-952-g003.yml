caption: BRIEF subtest and composite scales for TT1 patients, PKU patients, and healthy
  controls. Data are presented with min–max whisker plots. Higher scores indicate
  more problems. Statistical differences between the groups after Benjamini–Hochberg
  correction are depicted as *. Due to missing questions/questionnaires, the number
  of patients on the scales varied between 22 and 28 for TT1 patients, and between
  50 and 51 for healthy controls. Thirty‐one PKU patients were included for all scales.
