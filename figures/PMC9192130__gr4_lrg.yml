caption: The effect of IRE1 pathway activation on PDCoV replication. (A, B) The effect
  of RE1 inhibitors STF-083010 (A) and 4µ8c (B) on PDCoV replication. LLC-PK1 cells
  were treated with various concentrations (10 or 20 µM) of inhibitors STF-083010
  or 4µ8c and then infected with PDCoV (MOI = 5) as described in the Materials and
  methods, before being used in quantitative real-time RT-PCR or western blot analysis
  for relative XBP1s mRNA and N protein expression. (C, D) The cellular supernatants
  from cells treated with DMSO or the highest concentration (20 µM) of STF-083010
  (C) or 4µ8c (D) were subjected to virus titer detection. (E, F) The effect of IRE1
  pathway inhibition on viral replication via genetic approach. LLC-PK1 cells were
  transfected with siRNA against IRE1 or negative control siRNA for 12 h and then
  infected with PDCoV (MOI = 5) for 12 h, before being used in quantitative real-time
  RT-PCR, western blot (E), or TCID50 (F) assay for viral replication. The presented
  results are the means and standard deviations of data from three independent experiments.
