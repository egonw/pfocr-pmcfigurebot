caption: eIF2α pathway activation after sEHi treatment. (A) Immunoblots and representative
  quantification of (B) eiF2α, (C) p‐eiF2α, (D) the ratio of p‐eiF2α/ eiF2α, and (E)
  CHOP. (F) Representative gene expression levels of Atf6, (G) Hmox‐1, (H) Nrf1, (I)
  p62, and (J) Ngf. (K) Schematic diagram showing the T/I/C‐treated astrocyte with
  UB‐SCG‐51 and/or SML0843. (L) Representative gene expression levels of C3. Values
  presented are the mean ± SEM. Groups were compared by one‐way ANOVA and post hoc
  Tukey's test; (n = 4 per group, n = 3–4 per group in cell culture experiments);
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ****p < 0.0001.
