figure_title: Effect of HFPGE on mRNA expressions of various cytokines in RAW 264.7
  cells. Cells were seeded and treated with HFPGE as described in . Total RNA was
  extracted, reverse-transcribed, and real-time PCR was performed. The mRNA expressions
  of (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β, (C) IL-6, (D) CXCL10, (E) G-CSF, (F) GM-CSF, and (G) MCP-1
  were normalized to GAPDH and presented relative to the 0 μg/mL group. Each bar expresses
  the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Means without the same letter differ, P < 0.05
caption: HFPGE, hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon grandiflorum extract; LPS, 0.1
  μg/mL lipopolysaccharide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  IL, interleukin; CXCL, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony-stimulating
  factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MCP, monocyte
  chemoattractant protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
