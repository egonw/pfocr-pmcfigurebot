caption: Linderalactone exhibits antitumor activity by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. (a, b) Western blot analysis of phosphorylated PI3K and phosphorylated
  AKT, total PI3K, and total AKT expression in BXPC-3 and CFPAC-1 cells after treatment
  with varying concentrations of LL. (c, d) After LL or YS-49 treatment, the expression
  of phosphorylated PI3K and phosphorylated AKT and total PI3K and total AKT in BXPC-3
  and CFPAC-1 cells. (e) After LL or YS-49 treatment, the clone formation assay detects
  the proliferation ability of BXPC-3 and CFPAC-1. (f) Quantification of clone formation.
  ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01.
