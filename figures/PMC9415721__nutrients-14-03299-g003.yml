caption: IHS regulates serum metabolites of ApcMin/+ mice. (A) OPLS-DA was used to
  analyze differences in serum metabolites between vehicle- and IHS-treated mice;
  (B) Cluster heat map of differential metabolites; (C) KEGG enrichment pathway bubble
  map. IHS increased the level of (D) Arg and (F) NO, and decreased the level of (E)
  Arg-1 in tumors, as analyzed using ELISA (n = 6); (G–I) IHS enhanced the expressions
  of IL-2 in tumors and in the spleen of ApcMin/+ mice, as analyzed using (G) ELISAs
  (n = 6), (I) Western blotting, and (H) IHC (20 ×, 50 μm). Data were analyzed using
  a one-way ANOVA and are shown expressed as means ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  vs. vehicle-treated mice.
