figure_title: pksple mutant brains show significant upregulation of innate immune
  response pathway genes across adulthood
caption: '(A) Volcano plot of microarray analysis of 7–10 dpe sple/sple brains compared
  with controls. log10 p values (y axis) were plotted against log2 fold changes (x
  axis); p < 0.05 and fold changes of ≤0.66 and ≥ 1.5 were used to call genes as being
  significantly downregulated or upregulated, respectively. Top Gene Ontology categories:
  innate immune response (green), oxidation-reduction process (blue), flavonoid biosynthesis
  process (orange), and heat shock response (magenta).(B) Gene Ontology terms based
  on enrichment scores (as in A) are listed in descending order: innate immune response,
  oxidation-reduction process, flavonoid biosynthetic process, and heat shock response.(C)
  qRT-PCR of 7–10 dpe sple/sple brains showing log2 fold-change values of specific
  AMP genes relative to control. All AMP genes show significant increase in expression
  in sple/sple brains. Data are shown as mean ± SEM; Student’s t test. n = 3 biological
  replicates/genotype.(D) qRT-PCR of 7–10 dpe control, sple/sple brains from flies
  with no seizure penetrance, and sple/sple brains from flies with high seizure penetrance.
  Most AMPs show significantly higher expression in sple/sple mutants with high seizures
  compared with control or sple/sple mutants that had no seizures, whereas the level
  of expression of AMP genes was either unchanged or significantly lower in sple/sple
  mutants with no seizures relative to control. Data are shown as mean ± SEM; one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. n = 3 biological replicates/group.(E)
  Representative confocal images and quantification of Attacin-GFP puncta (shown in
  green) normalized to controls in both +/+ and sple/sple mutant brains aged to 0,
  5, 15, and 30 dpe show significant increase in Attacin-GFP puncta in sple/sple brains
  for all time points. Data shown are mean ± SEM; Student’s t test. Dots represent
  individual values. n = 6–17 brains/genotype. Scale bars, 50 μm.*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤
  0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001. For source data, see .'
