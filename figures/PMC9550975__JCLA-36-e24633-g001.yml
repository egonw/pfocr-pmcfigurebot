caption: The effect of KIF18B overexpression on ESCC cell cycle. (A) The cell cycle
  distribution in ESCC cells transfected with KIF18B overexpression plasmid was assessed
  by flow cytometry. (B, C) The difference of cell proportion/ratio in each cell‐cycle
  phase was compared between KIF18B overexpression plasmid‐ and its vector control‐transfected
  cells. (D–G) After that, the protein levels of CDK4 and CyclinD3 were evaluated
  by Western blot. GAPDH was used as a loading control. All experiments had gone through
  three repetitions. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 versus Vector. ESCC, esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase; KIF18B,
  kinesin family member 18B
article_title: Upregulation of KIF18B facilitates malignant phenotype of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma by activating CDCA8/mTORC1 pathway.
