figure_title: A metabolic model of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis
caption: (A) Schematic illustration of the metabolic pathway including all reactions
  that are included in the metabolic model. Abbreviated enzyme names are in italics
  (table S1). (B) Metabolic model calibration to measured biomass-specific methanogenesis
  rate (sMR) as a function of the H2 concentration. Measured biomass-specific methanogenesis
  rate (circles) during the linear and stationary phase in laboratory cultures of
  M. thermoautotrophicus grown at 60Â°C (error bars are SDs for four experiments) ().
  The median (solid lines) of 103 model simulations with 1, 10, and 100 mM [CO2] and
  68% (gray envelope) of simulations with 10 mM [CO2] are shown. The envelope represents
  KM values that were drawn from posterior distributions resulting from the model
  calibration (see Methods, fig. S2, and table S5).
