caption: BPS caused ultrastructural changes of the nucleus, myelinated axons and synapses
  in mouse hippocampus after the 28-day control and BPS treatment. (A) Representative
  TEM images showing morphological nuclear changes. Red arrows show irregular nuclear
  envelope; blue arrows show the nucleolus; (a), control; (b), 2 mg/kg; (c), 20 mg/gk;
  (d), 200 mg/kg. Scale bar = 2 μm. (B) Representative TEM images show the ultrastructure
  of myelinated axons. Blue arrow shows normal myelinated axons; red arrows indicate
  axons with uncompacted myelin sheath; (a), control; (b), 2 mg/kg; (c), 20 mg/gk;
  (d), 200 mg/kg. Scale bar = 0.5 μm. (C) Representative TEM images show the ultrastructure
  of the synapses. Red arrows indicate normal synapses with construction of the presynaptic
  membrane, postsynaptic membrane and synaptic cleft; (a), control; (b), 2 mg/kg;
  (c), 20 mg/gk; (d), 200 mg/kg. Scale bar = 0.2 μm. (D) Effect of BPS on the number
  of synapses. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 5). Compared with the
  control group * p < 0.05.
