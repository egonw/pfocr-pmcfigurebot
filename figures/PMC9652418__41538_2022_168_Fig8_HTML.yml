figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of tilapia skin and soup in the boiling process
caption: A KEGG pathway annotation of differential metabolites between different samples
  (tilapia skins at 0 and 10 min, tilapia skins at 10 and 30 min, tilapia skins at
  30 and 60 min, tilapia skin soups at 10 and 30 min, and tilapia skin soups at 30
  and 60 min). B–F Bubble plots of differential metabolites between different samples.
  The larger the circle size and the deeper the red color intensity, the greater the
  impact on the respective pathway. B Tilapia skins at 0 and 10 min. C Tilapia skins
  at 10 and 30 min. D Tilapia skins at 30 and 60 min. E Tilapia skin soups at 10 and
  30 min. F Tilapia skin soups at 30 and 60 min.
