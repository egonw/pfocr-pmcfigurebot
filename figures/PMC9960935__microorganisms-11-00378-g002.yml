caption: 'Metal nanoparticles antimicrobial mechanisms. (1) MNPs interaction with
  the outer membrane leading to PLA activation, phospholipid hydrolysis and formation
  of pores; (2) M+ release into the periplasm and diffusion to cytoplasm through ionic
  channels; (3) enzyme inhibition from interaction with M+ leading to metabolic stress
  induction; (3′) respiratory chain disruption by ATPase disturbance (direct disruption);
  (4) respiratory chain indirect disruption; (5) ROS content increase resulting in
  DNA disruption and oxidative stress induction; (6) membrane disruption from ROS-induced
  lipid peroxidation resulting in the formation of pores and consequent cell content
  leakage leading to cell death; (7) MNPs interaction with EPS hindering biofilm formation.
  PLA: outer membrane phospholipase; TCA cycle: Tricarboxylic acid cycle; PPP: Pentose
  phosphate pathway; ROS: reactive oxygen species. Created with BioRender.com.'
