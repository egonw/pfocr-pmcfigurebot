caption: HuNoV increases the permeability of intestinal epithelial barrier. (A). The
  model of IEB. (B,C). Lenti-HuNoV or Lenti-VP1 transduction induced the production
  of AQP1. (D,E). HuNoV and VP1 significantly decreased the value of TEER. (F,G).
  HuNoV and VP1 promoted penetration of small molecular FITC–dextran. IEBs were transduced
  with empty lentivirus, lenti-HuNoV or lenti-VP1 at an MOI of 1 for 3 d. Cells were
  lysed, and the expression of AQP1 was detected by WB (B). The relative intensities
  of AQP1 blots were quantified (C). The value of TEER was measured by voltmeter (D,E).
  The IEB were pretreated with or without Bacopaside II for 1 h before FITC-conjugated
  dextran (1 mg/mL) was added to the upper chamber of Transwells. At the indicated
  time, 100 μL of sample in the lower chamber was collected and quantified using VARIOSKAN
  FLASH (Thermo Scientific) (F,G). For graphs, data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three
  independent experiments with each condition performed in triplicate. For images,
  one representative experiment out of three is shown. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, ns, not significantly. LV, empty lentivirus.
