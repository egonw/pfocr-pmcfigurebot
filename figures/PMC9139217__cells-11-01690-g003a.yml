caption: iTRAQ quantitative proteomics of mouse testes during recovery for 17 days
  after cisplatin/no treatment and the expression of oxidative-stress-related proteins
  in mice during different recovery periods after cisplatin/non-cisplatin treatment.
  (A) According to iTRAQ proteomic analysis, total spectra, spectra, unique spectra,
  peptides, unique peptides, and proteins were identified. (B) Proportional distribution
  of identified proteins based on their mass. (C) Peptide length distribution as a
  percentage of the total protein length. (D) Number of unique peptides that matched
  the proteins. (E) Protein coverage distribution in all of the identified proteins.
  (F) Three repetitions of the coefficient of variation distribution. (G) In the testes
  of the control d17 and CP d17 groups, a Venn diagram was used to identify the differentially
  expressed proteins associated with oxidative stress. (H) Heatmap showing the clustering
  of 110 DEPs between the control d17 and the CP d17 groups. (I) Connections among
  the 110 differentially expressed proteins relevant to oxidative stress revealed
  using the PPI network obtained from the STRING database. (J) The ordinate indicates
  the geneâ€™s name, the abscissa shows the number of genes, and the color reflects
  the adjusted p-value in an enriched gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 110 DEPs
  linked to oxidative stress. (K) Enrichment KEGG pathway analysis of the 110 DEPs
  related to oxidative stress; the ordinate displays the pathway name, the abscissa
  displays the differential protein count, and the color represents the adjusted p-value.
