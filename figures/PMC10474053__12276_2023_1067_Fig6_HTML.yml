figure_title: Ca2+-mediated inhibition of membrane localization of PIP-binding proteins
caption: Under pathological conditions such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, metabolic
  stress can increase the expression of Ca2+ channel proteins such as ORAI and IP3R,
  thereby increasing the intracellular degree of Ca2+ overload. At the same time,
  the expression and activity of SERCAs and PMCAs may decrease, causing depletion
  of Ca2+ stores in the ER and increased intracellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.
  In addition, dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis results in ER stress,
  activation of the UPR, increased ROS production, and oxidative stress, all of which
  may further impair the function of ATP-driven Ca2+ pumps such as SERCAs and PMCAs.
  The resulting ER and mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger a vicious cycle of intracellular
  Ca2+ overload and contribute to the development of insulin resistance and other
  metabolic disorders. In addition to affecting several Ca2+-dependent cellular pathways,
  such as the CaMK and CaN pathways, increased intracellular Ca2+ levels cause Ca2+
  to bind PIPs and thus form Ca2+-PIPs, which disrupt the electrostatic interactions
  between PIPs and PH domains or C2C domains in proteins, inhibiting the membrane
  localization of PH domain- or C2C domain-carrying proteins, and disrupting PIP signaling.
  Thus, Ca2+-PIP mediates the inhibition of the membrane localization of PH domain-
  or C2C domain-carrying signaling proteins, which leads to modulated signaling pathway
  activation in response to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ level.
