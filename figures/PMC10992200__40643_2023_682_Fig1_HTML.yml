caption: 'Model for carbon metabolism and energy conservation in M. thermoacetica.
  The RuMP cycle (blue), EMP pathway (purple) and Woodâ€“Ljungdahl pathway (green) are
  necessary for growth on pentoses, hexoses, and C1 gases, respectively. Abbreviations
  of the different metabolites are as follows: THF, tetrahydrofolate; X5P, xylulose-5-p;
  E4P, erythrose-4-P; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-P; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-P; FDP, fructose
  1, 6-diphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate.
  Ech, energy-converting hydrogenase complex; HydABC, FeFe-hydrogenase; NfnAB, NADH-dependent
  reduced ferredoxin: NADP oxidoreductase'
