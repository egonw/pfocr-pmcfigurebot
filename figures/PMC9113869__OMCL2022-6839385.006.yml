caption: 'In vitro, suppressing IL-10 greatly reduced the protective effect of AKG.
  (a) Western blot analysis of IL-10 expression (n = 4). (b and c) Representative
  pictures and quantitative analysis of superoxide anions levels as evaluated by DCFH-DA
  staining (n = 5). Scale bar, 100 μm. (d and e) Quantification of TUNEL-positive
  cells in SH-SY5Y cells in the indicated groups (n = 5) (TUNEL, green; DAPI, blue).
  Scale bar, 100 μm. (f–h) The proinflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA
  (n = 5). ∗P < 0.05 versus the OGD/R group and #P < 0.05 versus the OGD/R+AKG50 group.'
