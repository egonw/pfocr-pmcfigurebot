caption: Epithelial barrier integrity is negatively affected by pesticide exposure.
  On the left, an illustrative representation of the main epithelial barriers in their
  natural state, i.e., skin (A), lung (B), and gut (C), before exposure to pesticides
  and potentially other environmental stressors. Following chemical exposure (pesticides),
  a schematic representation is shown of a generic epithelial tissue presenting several
  inflammatory response outcomes after disruption of the barrier integrity due to
  pesticide exposure, such as loss of mucus and villi, increase of barrier permeability
  by cellular junction rupture, leaking, dysbiosis, and inflammatory response (D).
