caption: Association analysis of the omics data of GXDK6 under NaCl stress for 16 h.
  (A) Nine quadrants analyses of the associated genes/proteins in GXDK6; (B) Number
  of the DEGs and DEPs with consistent differential expression trend (upregulated
  or downregulated); (C) KEGG pathway analysis of the associated genes/proteins in
  GXDK6. In the panel (A), the red color indicated that the genes and proteins were
  both significantly differentially expressed; green indicated the genes were differentially
  expressed but the proteins were not differentially expressed; blue indicated the
  proteins were differentially expressed but the genes were not differentially expressed;
  black indicated that neither genes nor proteins were significant differentially
  expressed. In the panel (C), the different shades of red or green in the box indicated
  the value of p was low or high. When the associated DEGs/DEPs were significantly
  enriched in the pathways (p < 0.05), it was marked in red.
