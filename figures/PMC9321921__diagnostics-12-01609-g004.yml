caption: NRASQ61K mutation was detected by Sanger sequencing performed on DNA extracted
  from both tumor sample and CSF neoplastic cells. NRASQ61K is a hotspot mutation
  located in the GTP-binding region of the NRAS protein, conferring a loss of function
  as indicated by activation of downstream pathway signaling, increased survival,
  and transformation of cultured cells.
