caption: 'Influence of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) on the modulation
  of the DNA repair pathway choice. This schematic representation describes the strong
  complexity of the modulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling (in gray)
  as well as the four major DNA double‐strand break repair pathways: c‐NHEJ (in blue),
  SSA (in yellow), HR (in orange) and TMEJ (in red). This regulation occurs from the
  DDR signaling, to orientate the repair toward one of these four pathways. Other
  factors external to the DNA repair pathways (in purple) influence this choice, notably
  by post‐translational modification (phosphorylation, PARylation, ubiquitination).
  As shown in this figure, EMT factors (in green) are key modulators of pathways choice'

  pathway choice and its implications in cancer treatment.
