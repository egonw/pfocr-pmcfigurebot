caption: The pathway of intravenously administered antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
  against receptors such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), toward exhibiting brain
  cancer cell cytotoxicity through receptor-medicated transcytosis (RMT) in the secretory
  pathway. The mAb-TfR complex was liberated under weakly acidic conditions in the
  endosomes. Furthermore, linked drugs acting as a payload were also liberated via
  the cleavage of pH-sensitive cleavable linkers under weakly acidic conditions in
  the endosomes. Drugs released into the brain parenchyma can be transported into
  cancer cells and can show anti-cancer activity. Y represents a monoclonal antibody
  (mAb). The blue sphere indicates a receptor that mediates transcytosis in the capillary
  endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier. The red ovals represent a drug that
  is tethered with a mAb through a suitable linker. The dotted line indicates a linker
  contained in an ADC. The solid line represents the membrane.

  Antibody Conjugates.
