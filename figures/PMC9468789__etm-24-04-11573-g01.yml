caption: 'Effects of metformin on SRA, CD36, AEBP1, SR-B1 and ABCG1 expressions in
  ox-LDL-treated macrophages. (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression
  levels of SRA, CD36, AEBP1, SR-B1 and ABCG1 proteins following application of the
  indicated treatments; GAPDH was used as a control for the standardization of the
  total cellular protein. (B) Quantitative analysis of SRA levels. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of CD36 levels. (D) Quantitative analysis of AEBP1 levels. (E) Quantitative
  analysis of SR-B1 levels. (F) Quantitative analysis of ABCG1 levels. The data are
  expressed as mean ± standard deviation and are representative of three independent
  experiments. **P<0.01 vs. the PMA group, ***P<0.001 vs. the PMA group, #P<0.05 vs.
  the ox-LDL group, ##P<0.01 vs. the ox-LDL group and ###P<0.001 vs. the ox-LDL group.
  SRA, scavenger receptor A; CD36, cluster of differentiation 36; AEBP1, adipocyte
  enhancer-binding protein 1; SR-B1, scavenger receptor B1; ABCG1, ATP binding cassette
  transporter G1; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate.'
