caption: Metabolic, protein repair, and molecular transport pathways are differentially
  regulated by Carfilzomib in the kidneys. Emerging role of AMPKα. (A) Three-dimensional
  representation of principal components analysis (PCA) of the proteomic analysis
  (R2 = 0.989; R2Xo1 = 0.070). (B) Grouped graph of % associated genes (blue bar)
  and −logP value corrected with Benjamini-Hochberg test (red bar) regarding the significantly
  or/and differentially regulated proteins in the kidneys (n = 5–6 per group). (C–F)
  Representative Western blot images and relative densitometry analysis of protein
  repair-autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation-oxidative stress, and endothelial homeostasis-related
  pathways. Blue scatter bars refer to the control and red scatter bars refer to Cfz
  groups (n = 5–6 per group). Lines on the representative Western blot images facilitate
  the separation of groups/samples which were assessed on the same SDS-PAGE gel. All
  phosphorylated proteins are normalized to their respective total proteins and total
  proteins are normalized to GAPDH (loading control). Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. Student’s T-Test, unpaired, 2-tailed. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.005. Akt = protein
  kinase B; AMPKα = AMP-activated kinase α subunit; Bax = Bcl-2-associated X protein;
  Bcl-xL = B-cell lymphoma-extra-large; Cl.Casp1 = cleaved caspase 1; eNOS = endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; iNOS = inducible nitric oxide synthase; LC3B = microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B; MnSOD = manganese superoxide dismutase; mTOR = mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NFκB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; Raptor = regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; VEGF-A = vascular endothelial
  growth factor A; VEGFR2 = vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.
