caption: 'WNT5A may link SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD to hepatic proliferation(A and B) Volcano
  plot (A) and tabular form (B) of proteomics data obtained via TMT-LC/MS analysis
  of hepatic ER isolated from 2- to 3-months-old mice (n = 3 per group). Lines mark
  p = value 0.05 (horizontal) or 2-fold changes (vertical).(C–F) Western blot analysis
  of ER and non-ER fractions from livers of 2-month-old mice (n = 3 per group) (C,
  black and red arrows mark WNT5A mobility shift), hepatocellular carcinoma and normal
  liver tissue from the DEN-HFD liver cancer model (n = 2 per group, 2 independent
  repeats) (D), livers of 10-week-old mice 48-h post partial hepatectomy (n = 3 per
  group) (E), livers from chronic CCL4 treatment (n = 2 per group) (F).(G) Western
  blot analysis normal liver and tumor tissues from the year-long-HFD experiment (n =
  3 per group).(H and I) Hepatic cDNA microarray analyses of 9-week-old Sel1LAlb livers
  compared to Sel1Lf/f livers: (H) KEGG pathway for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  from differentially expressed hepatic genes with p < 0.05 and fold change >1.29,
  and (I) Heatmap of proliferation-associated genes as a logarithm of fold change
  in Sel1LAlb and Hrd1Alb livers as compared to Sel1Lf/f and Hrd1f/f livers, respectively
  (n = 3 per group).(J) Western blot analysis of HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated with
  500 ng/mL recombinant WNT5A protein for 30 h (2 independent repeats).(K) Western
  blot analysis of Sel1Lf/f and Sel1LAlb livers 2 weeks after i.v. injection of AAV8
  expressing shRNA targeting Wnt5A or luciferase control (n = 2–3 per group). Quantitation
  shown below each blot. Calnexin, ER fraction control; HSP90, loading and non-ER
  controls. Values, mean ± SEM; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001 by Student’s
  t test.'
