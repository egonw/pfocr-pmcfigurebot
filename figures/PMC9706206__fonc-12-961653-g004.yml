caption: Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of identified YYFZBJS-CRC
  common targets. (A) Biological processes. (B) Cellular components. (C) Molecular
  functions. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of key targets. The color scale
  indicates the p value, and the dot size indicates the gene count in each term. (E)
  Schematic of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (F) Gene–pathway network of YYFZBJS
  against CRC. Sky blue squares represent target genes. Red V shapes represent pathways.
  Big size of the dot represents higher betweenness centrality.
article_title: Integrated network pharmacology and experimental verification to investigate
  the mechanisms of YYFZBJS against colorectal cancer via CDK1/PI3K/Akt signaling.
