caption: Nitroxoline suppressed the metastasis of bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo.
  (A and B) Transwell assay and wound-healing assay were performed to evaluate migration
  of bladder cancer cells. (C) Luciferase-labelled UM-UC-3 cells were injected into
  nude mice by tail veins for experimental metastasis. (D) Bioluminescent signals
  were measured by the IVIS imaging system. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
