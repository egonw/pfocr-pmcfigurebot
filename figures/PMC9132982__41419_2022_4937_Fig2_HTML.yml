figure_title: The effect of EGFR expression on patient prognosis and cell proliferation
caption: A The expression levels of EGFR in different types of bladder cancer and
  adjacent tissues were detected by WB. B The TCGA database was used to analyze the
  correlation between EGFR expression and poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients.
  C, D Cells were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 /well) and lysed to collect protein
  or RNA when density reached 80–90%, the expression of EGFR and mRNA in 4 BC cells
  were analyzed by WB and RT-PCR. E Cells were plated in 96-well plates (6.0 × 103
  /well), The proliferation of T24 and J82 cells was detected at specified times by
  MTT assay. EGFR stable knockdown (F) and overexpressed (G) cell lines were constructed
  by lentiviral vector plasmid as described in “Materials and methods”, then cells
  were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 /well) and lysed to collect protein when
  density reached 80–90%. The expression of EGFR was detected by WB. H, I Cells were
  plated in 96-well plates (6.0 × 103/well), the proliferation of cell lines were
  detected at specified times by MTT assay. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. Error bars represent means ± SD from triplicate experiments. Vehicle
  control means the concentration of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001).
