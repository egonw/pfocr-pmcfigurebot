caption: Tumour mutation burden, immune escape mutations, and interferon gamma pathway
  activity. (A) Oncoprint showing tumour mutation burden stratified by type, immune
  escape mutations (list from [44]), MLH1 expression, and promoter methylation and
  germline MMR gene mutation. Bars to the right indicate the proportion of cases with
  loss of function (LOF) mutations, defined as a truncating point or frameshift variants.
  (B–D) Tumour nonsilent mutation rate (B), predicted indel neoantigen burden (C),
  and single nucleotide variant (SNV) neoantigen burden (D) according to cancer type
  and MMR status. (E) Multiple linear regression for predictors of IFNγ response.
  Regression included tumour type and MMR status, and candidate immune escape mutations
  shown in (A). (F,G) Relationship between JAK1 mutation and (F) JAK1 expression and
  (G) IFNγ response score in MSI CRC and EC. Comparison of LOF mutation frequency
  in (A) used Fisher's exact test. Comparison between groups in (C, D) used Mann–Whitney
  U tests; tests for interaction used aligned rank ANOVA. CRC, colorectal cancer;
  EC, endometrial cancer; FS, frameshift mutation; MSI, microsatellite unstable; MSS,
  microsatellite stable.
