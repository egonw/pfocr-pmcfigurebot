caption: Effect of FFA treatment for 24 h on proliferation and apoptosis of primary
  hepatocytes in laying hens. (A) The cell growth rate was monitored with an iCelligence
  real-time monitoring system. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of MMP. (C) The plot of
  MMP changes. (D) AO/EB staining and fluorescence microscopy analysis. (E) Data are
  expressed as the percentage of apoptotic cells in histogram statistics. White arrows
  point to normal cells and red arrows point to apoptotic cells. Data are shown as
  the mean Â± SD (n = 6), with (**) p < 0.01.
