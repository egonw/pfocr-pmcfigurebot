caption: Metabolic pathways relevant to healthy aging. (A) Bubble diagram of pathway
  enrichment analysis (y axis) and pathway topology analysis (x axis) of differential
  metabolites. Circle size is proportional to pathway impact value, and darker red
  color indicates more significant differences. The names of the significantly relevant
  pathways in terms of impact values > 0.2 and adjusted p-values < 0.05 are highlighted,
  including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; Î²-alanine metabolism; histidine
  metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; and arginine
  biosynthesis. (B) Schematic representation of integrative metabolic pathways, including
  the above 6 significantly relevant pathways. Significantly increased (red) and decreased
  (green) metabolites in the above significantly relevant pathways are shown. Column
  graphs show mean Â± SEM of the differential metabolites in the LRC group (red bar)
  and LRE group (blue bar). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
  Metabolites indicated in black represent that there is no significant difference
  between the two groups in this analysis. These significantly relevant metabolic
  pathways reflect a specific remodeling of amino acid metabolism in centenarians.
