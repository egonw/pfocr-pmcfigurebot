caption: Compound C inhibits OvCa cell proliferation. Compound C decreased the proliferation
  of (A). SKOV3, (B). OVCAR3, (C). CAOV3, (D). IGROV1, and (E). ID8 OvCa cell lines.
  IC50 was determined after 48 h time point. Represented is an experiment that was
  repeated twice (n = 4/experimental conditions) with reproducible results.
