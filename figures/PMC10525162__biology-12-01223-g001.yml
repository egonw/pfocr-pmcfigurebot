caption: Structures of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV and the host receptors to which they bind.
  (a) Schematic representation of the composition of SARS-CoV-2 virion, which consists
  of a spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid
  protein (N), and positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). To enter the host
  cell, SARS-CoV-2 primarily binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)
  receptor, using the S1 portion of the spike protein. After the binding between the
  spike protein and ACE-2, the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the
  spike protein to allow fusion of the viral and host cell surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 also
  has an alternative entry pathway through neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which also binds to
  the spike protein. (b) Schematic representation of the composition of the RSV virion,
  which presents an attachment glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), small hydrophobic
  protein (SH), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), polymerase protein (L), and
  a negative-sense single-stranded non-segmented RNA (âˆ’ssRNA). RSV can bind to various
  receptors, including CX3CR1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), which mediate
  virus attachment and bind to the G protein of the virus, and nucleolin (NCL) and
  the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which mediate virus internalization
  and promote fusion of the RSV virus, respectively. Created with BioRender.com.
