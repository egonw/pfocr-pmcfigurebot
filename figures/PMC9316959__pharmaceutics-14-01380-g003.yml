caption: Regulation of MYC signaling pathway and Bcl family proteins by miR-122. miR-122
  and MYC reciprocally regulate each other. MYC bound with CLIC1 suppresses the transcription
  of miR-122, whereas miR-122 downregulates CLIC1, E2F1, and TFDP2, leading to the
  suppression of the MYC signaling pathway. miR-122 can suppress the expression of
  the prosurvival Bcl family protein, Bcl-Ï‰, and MYC-induced Bcl-2 expression, which
  could enhance the action of proapoptotic Bcl family members.
