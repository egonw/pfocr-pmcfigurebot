figure_title: Figure 1.Transcriptional profiling of MNCs from peripheral blood and
  cord blood
caption: A. Heat map depicting all differentially expressed genes identified between
  cord blood (CB) and peripheral blood (PB) derived mononuclear cells (MNCs). Dendrograms
  show the hierarchical clustering (Pearson distance) between samples. CB donors are
  highlighted by blue and PB donors are denoted by red (n=5 per group). (B) Heat map
  of candidate gene expression measured by RT-qPCR in ex vivo expanded NK cells from
  CB and PB (Blue representing downregulation, red representing upregulation relative
  to the house keeping genes). Cells were expanded ex vivo as described in . All experiments
  were undertaken in triplicate. CB donors are highlighted by blue and PB donors are
  denoted by red. Pathways are categorized as NK cells effector function pathways
  (Orange) including, DAP signaling, Calcium signaling. NK cells Inhibition pathway
  genes (Blue). NK cells activation pathway genes and MAPK pathways (Green). Cytokines
  and Lytic enzymes pathway genes (Pink) (n=5). (C.) CB- and PB-derived NK cell phenotype,
  including NK cell activation, maturation, and exhaustion receptors. CD3 negative
  and CD56 positive cells were gated to quantify NK cells population and for further
  NK receptors analysis. Ex vivo expanded CB-derived NK cells (Blue bars) lacked any
  phenotypic evidence of exhaustion and maintained a similar phenotype to that of
  PB-derived NK cells (Red bars). Each dot represents individual donor and error bar
  represent standard deviation (n=8). (D-E). Anti-tumor function of PB- and CB- derived
  NK cells, as measured by luciferase-based cytotox assay, against U87 MG (n=6). (C.)
  CB-derived NK cells (Blue line) were equally efficient as PB-derived NK cells (Red
  line) in killing U87 MG targets at different E:T ratio (x-axis). (D) PB-and CB-derived
  NK cell’s 4 hrs cytotoxicity assay (n=6) target lysis (See ). (E) PB-and CB-derived
  NK cell’s 72 hrs cytotoxicity assay (n=4) target lysis. Error bars represent standard
  deviation.
