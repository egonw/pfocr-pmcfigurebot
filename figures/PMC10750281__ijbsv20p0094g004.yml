caption: 'JAK2 could reverse the effect of G3BP1 in NPC cells. (A and B) knocking
  down JAK2 might reverse the cell growth of HNE2 and 5-8F with overexpression of
  G3BP1 by CCK8 assay and clone formation. Note: (1) Control+siNC, (2) G3BP1+siNC,
  (3) G3BP1+siJAK2, (4) Control+siNC, (5) G3BP1+siNC, (6) G3BP1+siJAK2. (C) Knocking
  down JAK2 might reverse the invasion rates in matrigel invasion assay of HNE2 and
  5-8F with overexpression of G3BP1. (D) Knocking down JAK2 might reverse the migration
  rates in wound healing assay of HNE2 with overexpression of G3BP1. (E) p-STAT3 was
  up-regulated by overexpression of G3BP1, which could be recovered by knock-down
  of JAK2. (F and G) Overexpression of JAK2 might reverse the cell growth of HNE2
  and 5-8F with knocking down G3BP1 by CCK8 assay and clone formation. Note: (1) siNC+Vector,
  (2) siG3BP1+Vector, (3) siG3BP1+JAK2. (4) SiNC+Vector, (5) siG3BP1+Vector, (6) siG3BP1+JAK2.
  (H) Overexpression of JAK2 might reverse the invasion rates in matrigel invasion
  assay of HNE2 and 5-8F with knocking down G3BP1. (I) Overexpression of JAK2 might
  reverse the migration rates in wound healing assay with knocking down G3BP1 in HNE2
  cells. (J) Knocking down G3BP1 could decrease the expression of p-STAT3, which might
  be recovered by overexpression of JAK2.'
