caption: ST3GAL3 promoted the production of MMPs and inflammatory factors. (a–d) ELISA
  results showed that ST3GAL3 overexpression promoted MMP1, MMP3, IL-6, and IL-8 levels.
  (e–h) ELISA results showed that si-ST3GAL3 inhibited MMP1, MMP3, IL-6, and IL-8
  levels. n = 3. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the indicated
  group.
