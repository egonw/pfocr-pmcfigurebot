caption: Polarization-related signaling transduction in macrophages. The binding of
  growth factors or cytokines to their receptors activates STATs through JAKs or PI3K/AKT
  pathway signaling. Activated TLRs and IL-1βR trigger downstream signaling, including
  the NF-κB and the MAPK signaling pathways. Several transcription factors, such as
  AP-1, STATs, and p65, are regulated by the upstream signaling pathways and further
  promote the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. Then, the activated NLRP3 inflammasome
  promotes the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a CARD; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  IRAK, Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; MyD88, myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88; NLRP3 NOD-like receptor family pyrin
  domain containing 3; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; RTK, Receptor
  Tyrosine Kinases; STATs, signal transducers and activators of transcription; TLR,
  toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-beta.
