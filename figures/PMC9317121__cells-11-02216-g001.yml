caption: 'Tooth development. (a) The crown of the tooth is covered with enamel, while
  the root is covered with cementum and periodontal ligament. The cementoenamel junction
  is located between the enamel and root. The root is surrounded by the alveolar bone
  through periodontal ligaments. The dentin surrounds the dental pulp. Nerves, lymph,
  and blood vessels enter the dental pulp from the apical foramen of the tooth and
  provide nutrition and innervation to odontoblasts and dental pulp. (b) Teeth form
  from the surface epithelium and underlying mesenchyme, and their development is
  regulated by interactions between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme. The early
  stages are morphologically similar as the ectodermal placodes develop, form buds,
  and induce the formation of the dental papilla. In the tooth germ, epithelial folding
  is regulated by the enamel knot signaling center and it determines the shape of
  the tooth. During tooth development, it goes through various stages of tooth initiation:
  bud, cap, bell, and eruption. (c) Dentin consists of inter-tubular dentin and dentinal
  tubules. The figure was partially adapted with permission from Thesleff, 2003, ref.
