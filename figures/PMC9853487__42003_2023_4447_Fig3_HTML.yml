figure_title: Single-cell transcriptional signatures of clonal expansion of CD4 T
  cells
caption: a UMAP visualization of 137,075 CD4 T cell single-cell transcriptomes from
  the ISB-S CD4 dataset pooled across samples and conditions. 12 clusters identified
  using the Louvain algorithm. b Two-dimensional density plot of cells from each disease
  condition (healthy donor, mild, moderate, severe) by UMAP coordinates. Red represents
  areas of high density of cells of a given condition; blue represents areas of low
  density. c UMAP visualization with cells labeled by top eight most frequent CD4
  TCR clusters identified by the GLIPH2 analysis. d Two-dimensional density plot of
  cells with high or low pGen score clonotypes by UMAP coordinates. Yellow represents
  areas of high density of cells; black represents areas of low density. e Boxplots
  of clonally expanded cell proportions (in cluster 6) for each disease condition
  (cell count healthy donor = 544, mild = 3568, moderate = 5012, severe = 2336). Comparison
  between groups performed with two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. f Volcano plot of
  differentially expressed genes between clonally expanded cells and all other cells
  in the ISB-S CD4 dataset (Cluster 6 cells = 5000, all other cells = 5000). Differential
  gene expression was performed with Seurat using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test; the Bonferroni corrected adjusted p-values and log fold-change of the average
  expression were used for visualization. g Bar plot of biological processes (BP)
  pathway terms associated with downregulated genes (clonally expanded cells vs all
  other cells, q-value < 1e-4) by DAVID analysis. h Bar plot of biological processes
  (BP) pathway terms associated with upregulated genes (clonally expanded cells vs
  all other cells, q-value < 1e-4) by DAVID analysis.
