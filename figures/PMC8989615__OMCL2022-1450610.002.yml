caption: Key evidence for the involvement of ACTB in HCM. (a) The correlation between
  the expression of 15 candidate DEGs analyzed by GSE148602 dataset. (b) Interaction
  network diagram of 15 candidate DEGs (nodes represent proteins, and edges represent
  interrelationships between proteins. The larger the circle, the greater the degree
  value. The color of the circle changes from red to blue, indicating that the degree
  value changes from small to large, and the color of the line changes from red to
  blue, indicating that the combine score value changes from small to large). (c)
  15 candidate DEGs sorted by degree. (d) ACTB expression in plasma of HCM patients
  and normal controls analyzed using GSE148602 dataset. (e) The specific regulatory
  relationship of HCM signaling pathway (hsa05414) analyzed by KEGG.
