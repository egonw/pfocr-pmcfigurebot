caption: Differential regulation of downstream effector proteins in response to DMA
  treatment. (A) Immunoblot analysis of proteins involved in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
  in tumors derived from the tongue squamous cell carcinoma patient-derived xenograft
  at the end of the study (60 days) from the control (C), 4 Gy × 5 (R), DMA 25 mg/kg
  × 5 (D), and DMA 25 mg/kg × 5 + 4 Gy × 5 (DR) groups. (B) Densitometric analysis
  of representative Western blot. Band intensities were normalized to those of the
  normal form of each protein, GAPDH. p-values at * < 0.05, ** < 0.005, *** < 0.0005
  and **** < 0.00005 indicate statistical significance.
