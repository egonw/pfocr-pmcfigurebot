caption: Pathway and functional analysis of AKT1-dependent differentially altered
  genes. (A) Venn diagram showing the shared and unique genes regulated by AKT1 and/or
  AKT inhibitor VIII; (B) doughnut chart showing the functional annotation of differentially
  expressed genes upon AKT1 silencing using siAKT1; (C) doughnut chart showing the
  functional annotation of differentially expressed genes upon using the Pan-AKT Inhibitor
  VIII; (D) doughnut chart showing the functional annotation of downregulated genes
  upon AKT1 silencing; and (E) doughnut chart showing the functional annotation of
  upregulated genes upon AKT1 silencing.
