caption: 'Germline genetic variants in LFS. A, Classification scheme for genetic variants
  identified from WGS. The pyramid (top) shows how genes were prioritized into four
  tiers from highest known cancer predisposition potential to lowest. All variants
  were then classified using a Cancer Variant Classification Schema (Materials and
  Methods) into five classes (bottom) based on pathogenicity and whether the gene
  fell into Tier 1–4. AD: autosomal dominant; AR: autosomal recessive; CPG: cancer
  predisposition gene. B, Frequency of P/LP variants in known cancer genes (class
  1–3) in LFS, KiCS and 1kGP. Fisher exact test P values for comparisons between the
  LFS cohorts and KiCS/1kGP shown. C, Kaplan–Meier survival curve comparing patients
  with P/LP variants in the WNT signaling pathway (yellow), patients with at least
  one class 1–3 variant (red) and patients with neither WNT signaling or class 1–3
  variants (blue). D, Landscape of genetic alterations in cancer genes (class 1–3)
  in LFS. Annotated with family, cancer type and TP53 variant status. Genetic variants
  are indicated as a deletion (blue), SNV or indel (red) or duplication (purple).
  E, The proportion of individuals in the wildtype and variant TP53 cohorts with classes
  1–5 variants (Materials and Methods). F, The number of P/LP variants in cancer genes
  (class 1–3) in individuals that developed cancer compared with unaffected individuals,
  stratified by TP53 status. G, The number of P/LP variants (class 1–3) in wildtype
  versus variant TP53 carriers, stratified by cancer status. On the basis of the premise
  that variants in the WNT signaling pathway are associated with decreased cancer
  incidence in LFS, these variants were removed from the comparisons made in F and
  G.'
