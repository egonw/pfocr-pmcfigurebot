caption: Possible mechanisms of SFN role in tumorigenesis. Although SFN dependent
  on P53 induces the cell cycle arrest, it can prevent apoptosis by sequestrating
  Bad and Bax, which symbolizes an excellent capability of SFN as an oncogene [].
  In addition, it may have roles in proliferation, growth, motility, differentiation,
  and metabolism through PI3K/Akt pathway [].

  in Human Breast Cancer as the Regulator Biomarkers in a Novel ceRNA Network: Based
  on Bioinformatics and Experimental Analyses.'
