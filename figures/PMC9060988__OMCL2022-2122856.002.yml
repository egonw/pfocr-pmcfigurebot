caption: The lipid metabolism mechanism of Plin5 in DC. In oxidized tissues and adipocytes,
  Plin5 mainly regulates fatty acid metabolism through the MAPK pathway, PGC-1 Î±/PPAR
  pathway, and PI3K pathway. In pancreatic cells, Plin5 interferes with the PI3K pathway,
  GPR40 signaling pathway, and IRS-1 phosphorylation pathway to achieve its effect
  on pancreatic cells. When FA metabolism is disturbed, Plin5 can reduce the microvascular
  damage, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis/proliferation caused
  by FA by coordinating the mechanism of mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, inflammation,
  insulin resistance, and ER stress.
