caption: 'Huangqin decoction activates the Sirt1/NF-Κb pathway in high-fat diet-induced
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rats. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3–4).
  aP < 0.01 vs the normal group, bP < 0.05 and cP < 0.01 vs the high-fat diet group.
  A: Expression levels of Sirt1, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, p-IRS-2/IRS-2, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein (SREBP)-1c, fatty acid synthase, and cluster of differentiation 36; B-G:
  Semi-quantitative analysis of these proteins; H-J: Representative images of immunohistochemical
  staining of Sirt1 (H), NF-κB (I), and SREBP-1c (J) in liver sections; K-M: Quantitative
  analysis of the staining intensity; N: Representative images of immunofluorescent
  staining of Sirt1 and NF-κB in liver sections; O and P: Quantitative analysis of
  the fluorescence intensity. CD36: Cluster of differentiation 36; DAPI: 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  FAS: Fatty acid synthase; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HFD:
  High-fat diet; HQD, Huangqin decoction; SREBP: Sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein.'

  resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by triggering Sirt1/NF-κB pathway.
