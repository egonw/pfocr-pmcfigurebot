caption: Functional enrichment analysis. (A) GSEA showed that many cancer-related
  pathways were activated in C1. (B) TCA-related pathway scores presented differences
  between the 2 clusters. (C) Score differences of pathways involved in cell growth
  and death between the 2 clusters. **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001. TCGA, The
  Cancer Genome Atlas; ns, no significance; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; TCA,
