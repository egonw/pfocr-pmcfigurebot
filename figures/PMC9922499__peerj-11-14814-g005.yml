figure_title: Gene and pathway analysis of sexually divergent RNA-Seq data
caption: (A) Volcano plots depicting genes meeting fold change and p-value thresholds
  in macrophages and osteoclasts. Differentials with âˆ’log10 transformed adjusted p-values
  of 6 and greater are plotted at the same level. Full volcano plots are included
  in . (B) Macrophage-specific, osteoclast-specific, and common pathways altered during
  osteoclastogenesis. Pathways are listed in .
article_title: RANK signaling in osteoclast precursors results in a more permissive
  epigenetic landscape and sexually divergent patterns of gene expression.
