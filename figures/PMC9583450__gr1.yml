caption: 'Experiment 1: RNA-sequencing of total RNA from plantaris muscle after 72 h
  of mechanical overload.A, study design schematic showing the conditions of Experiments
  1 to 5. B, pathway analysis of upregulated genes in OV versus sham. C, pathway analysis
  of downregulated genes in OV versus sham. D, Myc mRNA levels in sham and overload
  determined by RNA-seq. E, digital deconvolution of muscle overload data using CIBERSORTx
  () and data from Oprescu et al. () to delineate cellular contributions to the global
  transcriptome. Normalized gene count, gene counts normalized using DESeq2. EU, 5-Ethenyl
  uridine; OV, overload.'
article_title: Multi-transcriptome analysis following an acute skeletal muscle growth
  stimulus yields tools for discerning global and MYC regulatory networks.
