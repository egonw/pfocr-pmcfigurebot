caption: Sufentanil inhibits the apoptosis of OGD/R-induced human cardiac microvascular
  endothelial cells. (A and B) The apoptosis was detected using TUNEL. (C) The expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins were detected using western blotting. Data
  are expressed as the mean Â± SD. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. OGD/R, oxygen and glucose
  deprivation/reoxygenation.
article_title: Sufentanil ameliorates oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced
  endothelial barrier dysfunction in HCMECs via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
