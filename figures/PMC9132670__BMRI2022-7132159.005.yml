caption: Possible mechanism of BRU reversal of EMT process in colorectal cancer cells.
  After HCT-116 and SW480 cells were treated with or without BRU, Y27632 and BRU + Y27632,
  RhoA and ROCK1 in cells were analyzed by western blot (a, c) and quantitative analysis
  by the Image Lab software (b, d); after HCT-116 and SW480 cells were treated with
  or without BRU, Y27632, BRU + Y27632, western blot analysis of E-cadherin, Vimentin,
  N-cadherin, MMP2, MMP9 in cells (e, g) and quantitative analysis of the Image Lab
  software (f, h). All data were shown as mean ± SD from three independent trials
  (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control).
