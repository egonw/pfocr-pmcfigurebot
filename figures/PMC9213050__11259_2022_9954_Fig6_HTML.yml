caption: PPV1 infection induces apoptosis by activating the NF-κB pathway. PK-15 cells
  were infected with PPV1 (MOI = 1) and treated with NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (0.5 μM
  or 5 μM) as indicated. Mock-infected PK-15 cells were used as controls. After 36 h,
  the cells were subjected to apoptosis analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± SD
  from three independent experiments. *0.01 < p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
article_title: TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in PPV1-induced apoptosis
  in PK-15 cells.
