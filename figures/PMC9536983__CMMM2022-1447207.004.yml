caption: 'The carcinogenic effect of MSC-AS1 on C666-1 cells is disturbed by intervening
  miR-429 expression. (a) After the C666-1 cells were cotransfected with si-MSC-AS1
  and miR-429 inhibitor, the expression of miR-429 was measured by qRT-PCR analysis.
  The increased miR-429 expression induced by MSC-AS1 silence was repressed by the
  miR-429 inhibitor. NS: no significant difference; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (b)
  Cell viability after cotransfected with si-MSC-AS1 and miR-429 inhibitor was estimated
  by MTT assay. Cell viability was significantly declined by MSC-AS1 expression inhibition,
  which was abolished by cotransfected with miR-429 inhibitor. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, compared
  with controls. (c) Colony formation assay was performed to analyze the cell proliferation.
  The number of cell colonies was significantly decreased after MSC-AS1 knockdown
  and was reversely increased after cotransfected with miRNA-429 inhibitor. NS: no
  significant difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (d) Cell migration ability was observed by
  wound scratch. Cell migration was obviously suppressed in MSC-AS1 knockdown cells
  and was reversed by cotransfection with miRNA-429 inhibitor. NS: no significant
  difference; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (e) Cell invasion ability was evaluated by transwell assay.
  Cell invasion ability was remarkably inhibited in cells transfected with si- MSC-AS1 + miRNA-ctrl
  but was obviously enhanced in the si-MSC-AS1 + miR-429 inhibitor group. NS: no significant
  difference; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.'
