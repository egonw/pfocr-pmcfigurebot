caption: 'Summary of pathway analysis using Metaboanalyst. The map was obtained through
  online analysis (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ (accessed on 9 June 2023)). The significant
  metabolic pathways (raw p value < 0.05, FDR < 0.05, impact > 0.2) have been marked
  with numbers: (1) arginine biosynthesis, (2) arginine and proline metabolism, (3)
  alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, (4) glycine, serine and threonine metabolism,
  (5) glycerophospholipid metabolism, (6) citrate cycle (TCA cycle), (7) phenylalanine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, (8) sphingolipid metabolism, (9) pyruvate
  metabolism. Color gradient: yellow (less significant) to red (most significant).'
