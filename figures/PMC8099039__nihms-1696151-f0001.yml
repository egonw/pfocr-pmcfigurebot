caption: Visual system anatomy. (a,b) Schematic representation of the entire visual
  pathway in axial view (a) and the optic radiations in sagittal view (b), extending
  from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the cortex. (c,d) Diffusion tensor
  imaging (DTI) reconstructions of the visual pathway in successive axial planes (c)
  and in the sagittal plane (d), with emphasis on the spatial relationship of the
  three bundles of the optic radiations. Adapted with permission from Ref. .
