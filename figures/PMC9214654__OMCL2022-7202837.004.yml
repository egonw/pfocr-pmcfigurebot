caption: 'Effects of the conditioned media of TLR4/HH pathway regulated PMSCs on HTR-8/Svneo
  cells and HUVECs. (a) ELISA analysis of MMP9 concentrations of cell culture medium
  in different groups of PMSCs. (b) Representative Transwell photos and cell number
  of the migrated HTR-8/Svneo cells in different groups. (c) Representative Transwell
  photos and cell number of the invasive HTR-8/Svneo cells in different groups. (d)
  Representative Transwell photos and the cell number of the HUVEC migration in different
  groups. (e) ELISA analysis of sFlt-1 concentrations of cell culture medium in the
  preeclamptic and normal PMSCs. (f) Tube formation of HUVECs and the total length
  of the formative tube in different groups. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 by Student''s
  t-test and one-way ANOVA. SD: Standard deviation.'
