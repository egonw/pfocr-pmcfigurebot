caption: Upragulation of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein expressions in human
  glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Levels of the AR protein in normal human
  brains (n = 10) and human male (n = 55) and female (n = 44) GBM tissues were mined
  from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed using the UALCAN platform
  (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/, accessed on 12 July 2022) (A). Corelations of AR mRNA
  expression in human GBM tissues with wild-type and mutant tumor protein 53 (TP53)
  were carried out in the UALCAN system (B). Each value represents the minimum, lower
  quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum. An asterisk (*) indicates that the
  value significantly differs from the respective normal group, at p < 0.05. TPM,
  transcripts per million.
