caption: 'a RT-PCR showing UBCH10 expression in KALLU+ cells treated with si-Control
  (si-Cont) and si-TNFR1. ***P < 0.001; Student’s t-test (mean ± SD of three samples
  per group). b Left: Immunoblotting analysis showing levels of the indicated proteins
  in KALLU+ cells treated with si-Control (si-Con) and si-UBCH10 (si-UB). β-actin,
  a protein-loading control. Right: Immunoblotting analysis showing Twist and UBCH10
  levels in KALLU+ (-), si-TNFR1 RNA-treated KALLU+ cells (si-TNFR1 RNA including
  si-A, si-B, si-C, and si-ABC), and si-TNFR1 RNA-treated KALLU+ cells with reintroduced
  Ube2c/UBCH10 cDNA. β-actin, a protein-loading control. c Left: Comparison the growth
  of tumors, derived from KALLU+ cells treated with si-Control or si-UBCH10, in nude
  mice (n = 5/group). Mean ± SD; *P < 0.01; two-way AVOVA test. d Survival curves
  of lung SCC patients with high TNFRSF1A and UBE2C levels or low TNFRSF1A levels.
  Lung SCC patient cohorts were obtained from Kaplan–Meier plotter. e Left: Immunoblotting
  analysis showing levels of K5, E-cadherin, and UBCH10 in KALLU+ cells overexpressing
  a control or HA-IKKα vector. β-actin, a protein-loading control. Right: RT-PCR examines
  TNF expression in KALLU+ cells and KALLU+ cells overexpressing HA-IKKα with. Mean ± SEM
  (three repeats per group). **P < 0.01; Student’s t-test. f Growth curves of KALLU+
  cells that were transfected with a control vector or HA-IKKα vector (n = 5/group).
  Mean ± SD; **P < 0.01; two-way AVOVA statistical test. g The sizes of tumors obtained
  from KALLU+ cells treated with the control or HA-IKKα vector (2 × 105 cells per
  mouse) were subcutaneously injected into nude mice (n = 5/group). Tumor growth was
  analyzed by a grouped two-way AVOVA statistical test; Mean ± SD; *P < 0.05. h Left:
  Images showing a liver (top) and lung (bottom) with metastases (Fig.  shows H&E
  histological images). Right: H&E images of liver and lung metastases induced by
  arrows. Scale bar: 40 μM. i RT-PCR showing UBCH10 mRNA levels in KALLU+ cells transfected
  with IKKα or control vectors (n = 3/group). Mean ± SD; ***P < 0.001; Student’s t-test.
  j A working model for the TNFR1-UBCH10 pathway predicted to increase c-Myc, Bcl2,
  Twist1, and Sox2 expression and SCC dedifferentiation. IKKα inhibits UBCH10 expression.
  Arrow, enhancement; two lines, inhibition. k Human H520 SCC cell line was selected
  with stem cell markers and used to generate two sub-populations (left). H520 (CD24loCD44+)
  cells express elevated TNFR1 levels compared to H520 (CD24hiCD44+) cells. Mean ± SD
  (three repeats per group); ***P < 0.001; Student’s t-test. l H520 (CD24loCD44+)
  cells generated tumors induced by subcutaneous injections and metastasis to lungs
  in nude mice (n = 5). Scale bar: 40 μM.'
