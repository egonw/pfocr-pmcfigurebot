caption: Roles of GLIS1 and GLIS2 in breast cancer. (A) Expression of GLIS1 in breast
  cancer cells increases the expression of EMT promoting genes, such as SNAI1, VIM,
  WNT5A, and TWIST, thereby promoting cell migration. MiR-1-3p inhibits the expression
  of GLIS1 and EMT. (B) Schematic of the interplay between SNAIL, primary cilium,
  regulation of GLIS2 repressor activity, and stem cell renewal. SNAIL induces GLIS2
  polyubiquitination at K251 through a primary cilium-dependent mechanism that involves
  stimulation of EMT and FGFR1 expression. This polyubiquitination causes loss of
  GLIS2 repressor function, and subsequent activation of GLI1 and WNT genes and increased
  stem cell renewal []. These actions are inhibited by ciliobrevin A, a ciliogenesis
  and hedgehog pathway inhibitor. GLIS2-K251R functions as a constitutive repressor
  and inhibitor of stem cell renewal.
