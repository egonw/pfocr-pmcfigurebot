caption: Analysis of the dose-dependent effect of 5-aza-dC on the COL6A3 expression.
  Western blots and statistic analysis results show COL6A3 expression in ES2 cells,
  ES2 TS, ES2TR160 cells, and ES2TR160 TS treated with 0, 2, 5, and 10 μM 5-aza-dC.
  The blots were cropped from the original blots. (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, all by students’
  t-test). The numbers in the immunoblot represent the relative folds of COL6A3 in
  ES2 cells, ES2 TS, ES2TR160 cells, and ES2TR160 TS treated with 0, 2, 5, and 10
  μM 5-aza-dC. The numbers in the immunoblot were calculated as COL6A3 density/COL6A3+GAPDH
  density and set the control group in ES2 cells, ES2 TS, ES2TR160 cells, and ES2TR160
  TS without 5-aza-dC treatment as 1.

  effects on ovarian clear cell cancer stem-like/spheroid cells by inhibiting the
  COL6A3-AKT-mTOR pathway.
