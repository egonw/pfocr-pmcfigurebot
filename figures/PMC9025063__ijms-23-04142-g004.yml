caption: Classic base excision repair copes with various abnormal or modified bases,
  while single-strand break repair is a related, specialized pathway that resolves
  non-conventional 3′ or 5′ termini in DNA. Full pathway descriptions and protein
  details can be found in the text and . The large red line indicates the substrate
  base, whereas the smaller red box designates the 5′ sugar fragment prior to removal
  by POLꞵ (Short-patch) or during strand-displacement synthesis (Long-patch). The
  black slashes in SSBR represent various non-conventional ends processed by specific
  enzymes as discussed in the text.
