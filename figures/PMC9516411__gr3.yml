caption: The activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is strongly
  induced in the liver of cattle. (A and B) Volcano plot for the differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in the liver of cattle compared with that of human or pig. Red points
  are down-regulated DEGs. Green points are up-regulated DEGs. The cut-off used to
  designate a DEG was an adjusted P < 0.01. (C and D) DEGs of mTORC1 signaling in
  the liver of cattle, human, and pig. Grey indicates cattle, and yellow indicates
  human or pig (n = 20), P < 0.01.
