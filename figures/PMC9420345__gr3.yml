caption: 'Inhibition of proteasome suppresses XR-induced elevation in mTORC1 signaling(A)
  Western blot analysis of the levels of mTORC1 signaling pathway components in FaDu
  cells treated with PIs plus XR as in B. (B) Western blot analysis of mTORC1 signaling
  activation in FaDu cells treated with PT33 followed by XR at indicated times. (C)
  Western blot analysis of the influence of XR on mTORC1 signaling at indicated times
  in FaDu cells at a high cell density. (D) Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by PIs
  for various time intervals in FaDu cells before treatment with XR at a medium/high
  cell density. (E) Western blot analysis of the levels of mTORC1 signaling pathway
  components in FaDu cells treated with XR followed by rapamycin or PT33 for the indicated
  time, respectively. For all assays, 10 nM of BTZ, 20 nM of PT33, and 100 nM of rapamycin
  were used; DMSO or NR was used as vehicle control; RAPA: rapamycin; and the XR dose
  was 6-Gy.'
