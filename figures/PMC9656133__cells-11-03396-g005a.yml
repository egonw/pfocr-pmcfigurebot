  (a) Correlation analysis diagram of quality control (QC) samples. Pearson correlation
  coefficient between QC samples was calculated based on the relative quantitative
  values of metabolites. (a1) is the Pearson correlation coefficient between seven
  groups of data QC samples in positive ion mode. (a2) is the Pearson correlation
  coefficient between seven groups of data QC samples in positive ion mode. Pearson
  correlation coefficient between seven groups of data QC samples. (b) PCA analysis
  diagram of total samples. The peaks extracted from all the experimental samples
  and QC samples were analyzed using PCA. In the figure, the abscissa PC1 and ordinate
  PC2 represent the scores of the first and second principal components, respectively;
  the scatter points of different colors represent samples in different experimental
  groups; and the ellipse represents the 95% confidence interval. (b1) is the PCA
  analysis diagram of the total sample in the positive ion mode, and (b2) is the PCA
  analysis diagram of the total sample in the negative ion mode. (c) Differential
  metabolite clustering heat map. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on
  the two groups of differential metabolites to obtain the differences in metabolic
  expression patterns between and within the two groups. The abscissa represents the
  sample name and clustering results, and the ordinate represents the differential
  metabolites and clustering results. Red and blue represent high and low expression
  metabolites, respectively. (c1) is the heat map of differential metabolites in positive
  ion mode, and (c2) is the heat map of differential metabolites in negative ion mode.
  (d) Volcanic map of differential metabolites. The abscissa represents the fold change
  of metabolites in different groups (log2(Fold Change)), and the ordinate represents
  the significant level of difference (–log10 (p-value)). Each point in the volcano
  diagram represents a metabolite, and the significantly upregulated metabolites are
  represented by red points and the significantly downregulated metabolites are represented
  by green points. The size of the dots represents the VIP value. (d1) is the volcano
  map of differential metabolites in positive ion mode, and (d2) is the volcano map
  of differential metabolites in negative ion mode. (e) Correlation analysis diagram
  of differential metabolites. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between all metabolites
  was calculated to analyze the correlation between each metabolite. When the linear
  relationship between the two metabolites is strengthened, the positive correlation
  tends to 1, and the negative correlation tends to –1. At the same time, the statistical
  test of significance was carried out on the correlation analysis of metabolites,
  and the threshold of significant correlation was selected as the significance level
  p-value < 0.05. (e1) is the correlation analysis diagram of differential metabolites
  in positive ion mode, and (e2) is the correlation analysis diagram of differential
  metabolites in negative ion mode. (f) Differential metabolite KEGG enrichment bubble
  diagram. According to the enrichment results of differential metabolites, the bubble
  chart of the KEGG pathway was drawn (only the top 20 results are shown). In the
  figure, the horizontal coordinate is x/y (the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding metabolic pathway/the number of total metabolites identified
  in the pathway). The higher the value, the higher the enrichment degree of differential
  metabolites in the pathway. The color of the dot represents the p-value of the hypergeometric
  test, and the smaller the value, the greater the reliability and statistical significance
  of the test. The size of the dot represents the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding pathway, and the larger the dot, the more differential metabolites
  in the pathway. (f1) is the KEGG enrichment bubble diagram of differential metabolites
  in positive ion mode, and (f2) is the KEGG enrichment bubble diagram of differential
  metabolites in negative ion mode.
