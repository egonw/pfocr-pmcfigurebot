caption: Spermidine may participate in NIHL through activation of LC3B- and Beclin1-mediated
  autophagy via the β-alanine metabolism pathway and arginine and proline metabolism
  pathways. (a) Summary of the metabolites and corresponding regulation genes in the
  β-alanine metabolism pathway and arginine and proline metabolism pathways. (b) The
  relative mRNA expression of autophagy-related genes (LC3B and Beclin1). (c, d) Localization
  and expression levels of LC3B and Beclin1 proteins were detected by the immunofluorescence
  assay in the control group and noise group. The red and green fonts represent the
  up- and downregulation of differential metabolites in the solid line box; data are
  represented as mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the control group.
