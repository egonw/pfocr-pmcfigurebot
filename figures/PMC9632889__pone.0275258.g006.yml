figure_title: Leonurine reduced the expression of proteins related to fibrosis in
  H9c2 cells stimulated by TGF-β
caption: '(A) Compared to H9c2 cells induced by TGF-β for 48 hours, leonurine decreased
  the expression of proteins related to fibrosis including (B) FN1, (C) α-SMA, and
  (D) COL3A1. #P<0.01, ###P<0.001, model group vs. control group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, 20 μM leonurine group vs. model group.'
article_title: Leonurine inhibits cardiomyocyte pyroptosis to attenuate cardiac fibrosis
  via the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway.
