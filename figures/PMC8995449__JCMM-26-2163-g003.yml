caption: Nur77 suppresses the NF‐κB signalling pathway to inhibit osteoclast differentiation.
  (A‐D) Silencing Nur77 increased the expression of osteoclast differentiation factors,
  while overexpression of Nur77 had the opposite effect; the mRNA expression levels
  of Car2 (A), Ctsk (B), ACP5, (C) and NFATC1 (D) were analysed. (E‐F) Deletion of
  Nur77 increased the potential for RAW264.7 cells to differentiate into osteoclasts;
  however, PDTC (an inhibitor of NF‐κB) reversed this phenomenon. (E) TRAP staining
  image of osteoclast differentiation cultures. Multinucleated TRAP+ (red) cells were
  identified as mature osteoclasts on day 5. (F) Osteoclast numbers. (G) Silencing
  Nur77 activated the NF‐κB signalling pathway and increased the levels of TNF‐α and
  IL‐6 in RAW264.7 cells, while (H) overexpressing Nur77 inhibited the NF‐κB signalling
  pathway and decreased the TNF‐α and IL‐6 expression in RAW264.7 cells. All data
  are presented as boxplots with median and interquartile range and were statistically
  assessed by one‐way analysis followed by the Bonferroni test. *p < 0.001
