caption: Regulation of lung inflammation and oxidative stress by Nrf2 signaling pathway
  crosstalk. Bacteria, viruses, harmful gases, and other stimuli induce excessive
  oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in the lungs. Animal studies have shown
  that Toll-like receptor-induced ROS production can be activated by endotracheal
  infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or inhalation of cigarette smoke (CSE) in mice.
  Excessive ROS directly activates the NFκB inflammatory pathway and the phosphorylation
  of AKT, ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK inflammatory pathways,
  inducing the transfer of NFκB into the nucleus to promote the production of inflammatory
  factors (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β). In addition, ROS directly promotes nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2 and induces nuclear transfer of Nrf2 through enhanced phosphorylation of
  AKT and GSK-3β, thereby promoting the expression of downstream antioxidant factors
  and inhibiting the NFκB inflammatory pathway. When ROS overproduction occurs, the
  Nrf2/ARE antioxidant pathway is unable to maintain a balance between oxidation and
  antioxidation, resulting in oxidative and inflammatory damage to the lungs.
