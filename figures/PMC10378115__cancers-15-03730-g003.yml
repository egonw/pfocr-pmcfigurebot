caption: Paclitaxel treatment induces cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in BLCA
  cells. (A,B) Flow cytometry analysis of RT4 cells (malignancy grade I) either untreated
  (A) or treated with 1 μg/mL paclitaxel (B). (C) Sensitivity of RT4 cells to paclitaxel
  after 24 and 48 h of treatment, as assessed by an MTT assay. (D,E) Flow cytometry
  analysis of RT112 cells (malignancy grade II) either untreated (D) or treated with
  1 μg/mL paclitaxel (E). (F) Sensitivity of RT112 cells to paclitaxel after 24 and
  48 h of treatment, as assessed by an MTT assay. (G,H) Flow cytometry analysis of
  T24 cells (malignancy grade III) either untreated (G) or treated with 1 μg/mL paclitaxel
  (H). (I) Sensitivity of T24 cells to paclitaxel after 24 and 48 h of treatment,
  as assessed by an MTT assay. (J,K) Flow cytometry analysis of TCCSUP cells (malignancy
  grade IV) either untreated (J) or treated with 1 μg/mL paclitaxel (K). (L) Sensitivity
  of TCCSUP cells to paclitaxel after 24 and 48 h of treatment, as assessed by an
  MTT assay. Flow cytometry experiments were performed in triplicate, and representative
  graphs were shown. MTT assays were performed in three biological replicates, with
  the graphs depicting the median values and error bars representing the standard
  error of each biological replicate.
