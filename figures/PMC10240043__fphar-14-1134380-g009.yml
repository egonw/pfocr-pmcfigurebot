caption: 'PUE promotes the upregulation of HO-1 expression by activating Nrf2, and
  HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP reverses the protective effect of PUE. (A) Protein expression
  of Nrf2 after administration of ML385. (B) Protein expression of HO-1 after administration
  of ML385. (C) Cell viability after ZnPP administration. (D) Protein expression of
  HO-1 after administration of ZnPP. All data are expressed as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01
  vs. control group, *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01 vs. OGD/R group, △p < 0.05 or △△p < 0.01
  vs. PUE group.'
