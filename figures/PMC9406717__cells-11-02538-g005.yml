caption: miR-31-5p regulates genes involved in insulin signaling pathway and controls
  IDE protein at the physiological level (a) DAVID analysis showing fractional difference
  analysis of the top enrichment pathways of miR-31-5p target genes. * p < 0.05; **
  p < 0.01 (observed versus expected). (b) Representative Western blot analysis of
  IDE in SH and HepG2 cells transfected with control inhibitor (CI) or miR-31 inhibitor.
  HSP90 and Vinculin were used as loading controls.
