figure_title: The metabolic phenotype of resistant A549/DTX cells is characterized
  by increased oxidative stress and inhibited antioxidative potency
caption: 'a Typical metabolic effects of DTX on the methionine cycle-transsulfuration-GSH
  pathway that impact the relative abundances of intracellular and culture medium
  metabolites from A549 cells and A549/DTX cells (n = 6) (KB: original culture medium;
  SC: control A549 cells; SL: A549 cells+2 nM DTX; SH: A549 cells+10 nM DTX; RC: control
  A549/DTX cells; RL: A549/DTX cells+2 μM DTX; RH: A549/DTX cells+50μM DTX). b mRNA
  levels of key enzymes in the cystine uptake-GSH synthesis pathway in A549 and A549/DTX
  cells treated with or without DTX for 24 h (n = 3). c Protein levels of key enzymes
  in the cystine uptake-GSH synthesis pathway in A549 and A549/DTX cells treated with
  or without DTX for 24 h. The experiments were performed three times with similar
  results. d GSH/GSSG ratio in A549 cells and A549/DTX cells treated with or without
  DTX for 24 h (n = 6). e ROS levels in A549 and A549/DTX cells treated with or without
  DTX for 24 h (n = 3). f mRNA levels of P-gp in A549 cells treated with DTX for 24 h
  (n = 3). Unpaired t test with equal variance or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Data represent the
  mean ± SEM.'
