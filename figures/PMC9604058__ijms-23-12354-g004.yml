caption: MTERF1 regulates mitochondrial gene expression and OXPHOS in CRC cells. (A)
  Detection of the relative content of D-loop/18S rDNA by qPCR in HT-29 and HCT116
  cells upon upregulation and downregulation of MTERF1. (B,C) qRT–PCR analysis (B)
  and Western blot analysis (C) of the expression levels of mitochondrial coding genes
  and mitochondrial transcription-regulated genes. α-Tubulin was used as an internal
  control. (D) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of MTERF1, TFAM, and
  ND1 in clinical CRC tissues (C), paired paracarcinoma tissues (P), and paired normal
  tissues (N). GAPDH was used as an internal control. (E) Detection of ATP concentration
  in HT-29 and HCT116 cells. (F) Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
  in HT-29 and HCT116 cells using JC-1 staining. Reduction of ΔΨm prevents the accumulation
  of JC-1 in the mitochondria and disperses throughout the cells, leading to a shift
  from red (JC-1 aggregates) to green fluorescence (JC-1 monomers). NS represents
  no significant difference. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, two-tailed Student’s
  t-test. Data represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent biological
  replicates.
