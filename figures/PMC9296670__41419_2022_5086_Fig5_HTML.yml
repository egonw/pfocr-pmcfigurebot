figure_title: M2 macrophages secrete higher CXCL5 levels upon crosstalk with CAFs
  which in turn promote PCa progression via EMT
caption: 'a Immunofluorescence staining of α-SMA and FAP in prostate stroma CAFs.
  The number of α-SMA and FAP positive cells in the prostate stroma were markedly
  increased in the dCko mice compared with the control mice (*P < 0.05. two-tailed
  Student’s t-Test). Scale bar: 50 μm. b Upper panel: schematic diagram of co-culture
  system. PCa cells were cultured in the upper compartment and the target cells (NFs)
  in the lower compartment of the well. Lower panel: WB analysis shows NFs are markedly
  activated when co-cultured with HIC1-deleted C4-2B cells, and these effects could
  greatly be abolished by using TGF-β neutralizing antibody. c Schematic diagram of
  the conditional culture system. CD14+ PBMCs culture with TGF-β for 5 days followed
  by 2 days of conditional culture with (1) IgG, (2) CXCL12, (3) CAF1 conditional
  medium (CM) or (4) CAF1CM with CXCL12 neutralizing antibody. Then transfer these
  cells into normal medium for 2 days. Discard the cells and collect the supernatant
  for cytokine arrays at the end of the culture. d, e Supernatant cytokine array results
  show CXCL5, CCL2 and MMP-9 were significantly increased in the CM of both CXCL12
  activated-M2 macrophages and CAF1 activated-M2 macrophages compared with the corresponding
  control groups. f Treated with rhCXCL5 could promote prostate organoid growth, and
  this effect was markedly inhibited by SB225002. g–i The migration and invasive capabilities
  of PC3 cells were evaluated using a Transwell® assay (24 wells; Matrigel gel; Corning,
  Inc.). Transwell experiments (g) and WB analysis (h, i) show treatment with rhCXCL5
  enhanced the migration and invasive capabilities of PC3 sgHIC1 cells, and activation
  the AKT signaling pathway. These effects were partially abolished by SB225002. Knockdown
  CXCL5 receptor-CXCR2 in PC3 cells by siRNAs inhibited the EMT process and the AKT
  pathway (i). j The EMT phenotype of prostate organoids was also observed after treating
  with different concentrations of rhCXCL5 and markedly inhibited by SB225002. k ELISA
  analysis show dCKO mice have higher serum CXCL5 level than control group mice (n = 11
  each group) (**P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U-test).'
