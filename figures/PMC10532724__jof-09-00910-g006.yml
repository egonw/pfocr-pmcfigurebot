caption: 'SCE-E regulates ERK/CREB and AKT/NRF2 signaling in glutamate-induced oxidative
  stress. (A) Western blot and its histogram for (B) BDNF, pCREB, NRF2, and Keap1.
  (C) Protein expression and (D) its densitometric histogram for pERK/ERK and pAKT/AKT
  using Western blot. (E) Expression of NRF2 protein by SCE-E in HT22 cells treated
  with glutamate with/without wortmannin or PD98059 and (F) its representative photographs.
  All data are expressed as the mean Â± SEM. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs.
  Con; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. GLU. N = 3. Con: Control; GLU: glutamate;
  SCE-E: SCE EtOAc fraction. BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; pCREB: phosphorylated
  cAMP response element binding protein; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
  factor 2; Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; pERK: phosphorylated ERK; pAKT: phosphorylated AKT.'
