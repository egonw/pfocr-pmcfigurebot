caption: Illustration of the vital performance of an exogenous supply of SA and its
  biosynthetic pathway in mitigating salt stress. SA accumulation mutant snc1 triggers
  salt-induced injury, meanwhile SA deficit mutant nahG boosts SA signaling, blocking
  npr1-1 and snc1 and as a result, reduces salt stress. Due to the application of
  SA, salt-induced injury decreases by the variation in the expression pattern of
  the GST family of genes, such as SIGSTT2, SIGSTT3, and SIGSTT4 and antioxidant genes
  including GPX1, GPX2, DHAR, GR, GST1, HST2, MDHAR, and GS. During salt stress, SA
  application regulates stomata closure via secondary messengers (adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)) and these secondary messengers
  further regulate a variety of physiological activities and gene expressions, maintaining
  cell cycles and metabolic functions of the crops.
