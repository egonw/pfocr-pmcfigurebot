caption: Molecular docking simulation of active compounds with ligands. The top 10
  pairs of molecular docking simulations are exhibited. Ligands are displayed in green
  3D structures. Receptors are displayed in a 3D white helix structure. Binding areas
  are covered by the surface. 3D, three-dimensional.
