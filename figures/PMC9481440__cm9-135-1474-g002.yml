caption: 'The MAPKs regulate PANoptosis in SAE rats. Rats administered SB203580, PD98059,
  and SP600125, respectively. At 24 h after CLP, the protein levels of (A) caspase-3,
  Bcl-2, (B) NLRP3, caspase-1, (C) RIPK1, RIPK3, and p-MLKL in different groups are
  shown, with GAPDH used as the loading control. n = 5. Data are represented by histograms,
  and the sham group is normalized. ∗P < 0.05. All experiments were repeated three
  times and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation. CASP: Caspase. CLP: Cecal
  ligation and perforation; MAPK: Mitogen- activated protein kinase; MLKL: Mixed lineage
  kinase domain-like protein; NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein
  3; PANoptosis: Pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis; RIPK: Receptor-interacting
  protein kinase; SAE: Sepsis associated encephalopathy.'
