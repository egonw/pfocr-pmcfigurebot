caption: Illustration showing the pathway via which MSCs influence NPCy at the microenvironment
  leading to repair of IVDD. Factors such as TGF-β, GDF-5 and 6, BMP-7, PDGF, IGF-1,
  and βFGF are responsible for the differentiation of MSCs towards NPC-like cells.
  Also, acidity and osmolarity via diverse signaling pathways are key factors influencing
  the MSCs/NPC phenotype.
