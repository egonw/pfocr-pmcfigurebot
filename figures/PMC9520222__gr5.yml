caption: Transcriptome profiling of optimized LDH-regulated hUC-MSC function and mechanism.
  A) The volcano diagram of hUC-MSC (undifferentiated control group), Ctrl-CHO (differentiation
  control group) and LDH group. B) The heatmap distribution of hUC-MSCs, Ctrl and
  LDH treated groups. C) GO-P bubble graph of LDH regulated differentiated expressed
  genes (DEGs). D) GO-F analysis of LDH regulated DEGs. E) GSEA analysis of ACTIN
  filament organization and cell substrate adhesion. F) Protein-protein-interactions
  (PPI) analysis of LDH regulated significant genes.
