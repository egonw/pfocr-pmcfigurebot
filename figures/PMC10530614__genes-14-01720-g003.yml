caption: G-quadruplex formation during replication pausing and restart as a source
  of genetic instability. (A) G3T Leading Template. (A) Leading strand replication
  pausing during synthesis of the G-rich strand of (G3T)n. (B) After pausing, a G-quadruplex
  may form in the leading template. Replication may continue on the lagging template.
  (C) RecG-dependent fork reversal could place a G-quadruplex/i-motif ahead of the
  replication fork. It is not known if DNA repair machinery would work on the G-quadruplex/i-motif
  structure prior to replication restart. G-quadruplexes are shown in blue, while
  i-motifs are shown in green. (D) Replication on the ‘chicken foot’ following primer-template
  misalignment may also encounter a G-quadruplex, which could lead to deletions in
  the leading template. After branch migration, a G-quadruplex/i-motif could also
  form in the lagging strand, although it may not block continued fork progression.
  Note that an alternative restart pathway involving Holliday junction cleavage is
  not shown (see Kim et al. []). (B) G3T Lagging Template. While similar intermediates
  can be drawn when the G-rich repeat (G3T)n comprises the lagging template, the opportunity
  for formation of a G-quadruplex within a single strand is limited to late steps
  of a Holliday junction cleavage, recombination, and replication restart.
