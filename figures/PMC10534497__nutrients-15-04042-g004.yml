caption: 'Proposed model of HMO regulation by glucose availability. According to our
  hypothesis, two scenarios contribute to the transient rise in 3′SL: Plasma glucose
  levels are elevated due to the 75 g glucose uptake in the OGTT (blue arrow), and
  individuals with generally decreased insulin sensitivity (diabetogenic profile)
  have subclinically increased basal glucose availability (red arrow). (1) Liu et
  al. showed that increased availability of glucose leads to an increased expression
  of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (B1,4GalT), leading to the increased production of
  lactose []; however, as described by Neville et al., lactose production is independent
  of the short-term glucose availability in humans []. Considering these facts, we
  speculate that elevated lactose levels are predominantly observed in the case of
  decreased insulin sensitivity (red arrow), with elevated basal glucose levels. (2)
  Similarly, the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) depends on glucose availability
  as described by Chari et al. []. Higher glucose availability leads to higher flux
  through the HBP, leading to higher CMP-NeuAc5 sialic acid donor substrate. (3) Ultimately,
  the sialyltransferase activity (ST3Gal1) was shown to be enhanced under high glucose
  concentrations [] which could further contribute to the observed rise in 3′SL. The
  additive effect of altered insulin sensitivity through this hypothetic regulatory
  pathway would explain the observed differences in 3′SL between the clusters. The
  proposed pathways for HMO synthesis are located in the lactocytes of the mammary
  gland; however, HBP can also be activated in other peripheral tissues.'
