caption: Significant changes in mRNA expression in the DRGs of rats with CIBP identified
  by high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing. (A) Volcano plot of DEmRNAs. The vertical
  line indicates a 1.5-fold change in expression (upregulation or downregulation);
  the horizontal line indicates thresholds for 5% FDR. The red dots indicate upregulated
  mRNAs, and the blue dots indicate downregulated mRNAs. (B) Hierarchical cluster
  analysis of DEmRNAs. The color (from blue to red) represents the level of gene expression
  (log10 FPKM) from low to high, indicating the downregulation and upregulation of
  the expression. (C) Top 25 GO enrichment terms in the three groups, i.e., biological
  process, cellular component, and molecule function, for the DEmRNAs according to
  the p value. (D) Top 20 pathways in which the DEmRNAs were enriched according to
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis; the size of the bubble indicates the number of
  enriched mRNAs, the color indicates the p value, the red frame highlights the MAPK
  signaling pathway, which may be associated with CIBP.
