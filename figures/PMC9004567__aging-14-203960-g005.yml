caption: 'AI-derived targets crosstalk to aging-associated signaling pathways. Pathway
  enrichment analysis was performed on our 145 AI-derived targets based on KEGG PATHWAY
  Database. (A) MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010), (B) PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  (hsa04151) and (C) FOXO signaling pathway (hsa04068) were among the top 10 enriched
  pathways that were known to be associated with aging. Forty-six AI-derived targets
  were involved. Target-target interactions were identified in the contexts of pathways
  and networks retrieved from KEGG PATHWAY Database and literature (). Abbreviation:
  PAMPs: Pathogen-associated molecular patterns.'
