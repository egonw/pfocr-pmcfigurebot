caption: 'The crosstalk among AhR and other signalling pathways in tissue fibrosis.
  Both L-Kyn and KynA can activate AhR, and AhR is translocated to the nucleus upon
  interaction with a ligand, leading to AhR-sensitive transcription and fibrosis development.
  In addition to canonical AhR signalling, AhR also interacts with other pathways.
  TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin signalling are other core pathways of fibrosis progression
  that play pivotal roles in renal fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic
  fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis. AhR not only attenuates lung fibrosis by inducing
  Smad4 degradation in the proteasome but also alleviates hepatic fibrosis by disrupting
  the interaction of Smad3 and β-catenin. GSK3β is an inhibitor of β-catenin, and
  AhR may also inhibit lung fibrosis by maintaining GSK3β in an active form. Serotonin
  is a dedicated contributor to cardiac fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis by activating
  the TGF-β signalling pathway. Moreover, it also enhances β-catenin signalling by
  inhibiting GSK3β. Inflammation also contributes greatly to fibrogenesis, and AhR
  activated by FICZ improves acute kidney injury by inhibiting NF-κB. Furthermore,
  AhR has been proven to suppress fibrosis by activating MMP-1/MMP-3 in fibroblasts,
  but whether it has a similar effect on ageing-related fibrosis remains to be determined.
