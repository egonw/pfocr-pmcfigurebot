caption: High expression of CPNE8 was associated with the infiltration of cancer-associated
  fibroblasts in GC. (A) Manipulated Stromal score, Immune score, and ESTIMATE score
  based on CPNE8 status in TCGA-STAD cohort. (B) The correlation of CPNE8 expression
  and the infiltration of CAFs was quantified using the TIDE, EPIC, and XCELL algorithm
  in the TCGA-STAD cohort in the TIMER2 database. Each dot represents one sample.
  (C) Immunohistochemistry staining of CPNE8 and a-SMA in GC tissues of xenograft
  mice. (D) Significant and positive correlations between CPNE8 expression and ACTA2,
  FAP, ITGB1, PDPN, S100A4, and THY1. (E) The correlation of CPNE8 expression with
  various chemokines or chemokine receptors was displayed using the TISIDB database.
  (F) The mRNA levels of chemokine receptors were quantified by qRT-PCR in GC cells
  with respective knockdown or overexpression of CPNE8 compared to the control cells.
