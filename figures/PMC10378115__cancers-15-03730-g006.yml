caption: 'Paclitaxel treatment induces DNA damage without activating p53. (A) Immunoblot
  analysis of whole-cell protein extracts obtained from RT4, RT112, T24, and TCCSUP
  cells, seeded at ~60% confluency and exposed to the indicated doses (0, 0.1, 1,
  5, 10, and 50 μg/mL) of paclitaxel for 24 h. Protein extracts were blotted for total
  and phospho-H2AX (Ser139) to assess DNA Damage Response (DDR) and for total and
  phospho-p53 (Ser15) to assess p53 activation. Pan-Actin was a reference protein
  (n = 3 biological replicates). (B) RT-sqPCR analysis of total RNA extracted from
  RT4, RT112, T24, and TCCSUP cells, seeded at ~60% confluency and exposed to the
  indicated doses (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 50 μg/mL) of paclitaxel for 24 h. Expression
  of known p53 targets, PUMA and NOXA genes (mRNA levels), was analyzed to assess
  p53 activation. GAPDH mRNA expression was used as a control (n = 3 biological replicates).
  (C,D) Densitometry analysis of the obtained RT-sqPCR results. The density of PUMA
  and NOXA RT-sqPCR bands was analyzed and normalized to the density of GAPDH mRNA
  for each cell line and condition tested. A one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple
  hypothesis correction was employed to examine the statistical significance of the
  results. Error bars represent means ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates) (n.s.: non-significant).
