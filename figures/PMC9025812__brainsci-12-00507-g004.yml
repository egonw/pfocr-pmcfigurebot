caption: Activation of caspase-2 in ER stress pathway. (A) Control and 6OHDA-treated
  dDCNs were treated with zVDVADfmk and salubrinal. A 65% cell survival was observed
  in stressed dDCNs treated with salubrinal, whereas 67% cell survival was measured
  in zVDVADfmk-treated dDCNs after 6OHDA-induced stress. The combined effect of both
  inhibitors provided 71% dDCNs survival in 6OHDA+salubrinal+zVDVADfmk treated-dDCNs.
  The proportion of cells surviving was determined by MTT absorbance at 570nm. (B)
  Figure shows positive staining for TH in control and 6OHDA-treated dDCNs (green).
  A loss of dendrites was observed in TH positive dDCNs that had been exposed to 6OHDA.
  Caspase-2 was present in control and 6OHDA-treated TH positive dDCNs (red). There
  were more caspase-2 positive cells present in 6OHDA-treated dDCNs compared to untreated
  dDCNs. Caspase-2 was absent in salubrinal-treated and 6OHDA+salubrinal- treated
  dDCNs. This indicates that inhibiting the PERK pathway can suppress caspase-2 activity
  in dDCNs. The white arrow represents positive staining for cell bodies in dDCNs.
  (C) Illustrative example of GAPDH and caspase-2 in untreated, salubrinal-treated,
  6OHDA-treated and salubrinal+6OHDA-treated dDCNs. (D) Quantitatively, a significant
  increase in the caspase-2 level was detected in 6OHDA-treated dDCNs compared to
  control dDCNs (p < 0.05). The absence of caspase-2 in salubrinal-treated and 6OHDA+salubrinal-treated
  dDCNs suggests that caspase-2 activity is dependent upon the PERK pathway. Means
  of five experiments ± SEM is shown. A table of values and statistical analysis can
  be found in  for (A,D), respectively.
