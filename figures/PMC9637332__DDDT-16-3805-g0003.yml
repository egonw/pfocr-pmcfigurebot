caption: High fat diet induced intestinal microbiome dysbiosis and metabolic profiles
  disorders in Wistar rats. (A) LEfSe analysis of cladogram in Control group and HFD
  group. (B) Overview of the complete metabolism in Control group and HFD group. (C)
  The correlation graph shows the correlation between intestinal microbiome with fecal
  metabolites. (D) Above is the volcano map of fecal metabolites between the Control
  group and HFD group. Below is the KEGG bubble map of fecal metabonomics between
  the HFD group and the control group. The larger the Abscissa in the picture, the
  higher the enrichment of differential metabolites in the pathway. The color of the
  point represents the P-value value of the hypergeometric test, and the smaller the
  value is, the greater the reliability of the test is and the more statistically
  significant it is. The size of the point represents the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding pathway, and the larger the point, the more differential metabolites
  in the pathway. (E) Above is the volcano map of plasma metabolites between the Control
  group and HFD group. Below is the KEGG bubble map of plasma metabonomics between
  the HFD group and the control group.
