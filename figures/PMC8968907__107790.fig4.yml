caption: 'Mechanisms of venetoclax resistance. The figure depicts the four major modalities
  of resistance to venetoclax: cell-extrinsic mechanisms, outer and inner mitochondrial
  adaptation, genomic alterations, and expansion of intrinsically resistant subclones.
  Mechanisms highlighted in purple have been described in acute myeloid leukemia.
  Those highlighted in blue have been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. See
  text for pathway details. SCF: stem cell factors; OxPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation;
  FAO: fatty acid oxidation.'
