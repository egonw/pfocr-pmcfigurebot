caption: Infiltration of M1-tumor-associated macrophages is associated with the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the
  expression levels of CD68+HLA-DR+ in hepatoma tissue samples with (a) low, (b) intermediate
  and (c) high macrophage infiltration and p-p65 in hepatoma tissue with (d) low,
  (e) intermediate and (f) high macrophage infiltration. Samples within the same column
  (a and d; b and e; and c and f) represent the same tissue in a patient with liver
  cancer (magnification, ×200). (B-D) Following 6 h of treatment with JSH-23, the
  medium was replaced and the expression levels of p-p65 and p65 were measured by
  western blot analysis. (B) Representative western blot image and quantified p-p65/p65
  ratio in (C) HepG2 and (D) SNU-128 cells. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
  RM, regular medium; CM, conditioned medium; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; p-p65,
  phosphorylated NF-κB p65.
