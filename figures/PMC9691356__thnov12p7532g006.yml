caption: Cell-cell interactions of the primary and recurrent cSCC. A. Dependency wheel
  illustrating the interaction relationship between cells within the TME of primary
  and recurrent cSCC, the link size represents the interaction number. B. Cell-cell
  interactions of MDK signaling pathway in primary and recurrent cSCC, the link size
  represents the interaction strengthen. C. The IHC staining of VIM and MDK in representative
  samples. D. VIM and TGFB1 in hypodermis (number of positive cell/area), different
  tissue sites were marked by different color. E. The IHC staining of MDK in representative
  samples. F. The IHC score of MDK in primary, the first and second recurrence of
  cSCC, different tissue sites were marked by different color. G. Scatter plot of
  the score of MDK and VIM, MDK and TGFB1 in tumor samples of cSCC. Different dots
  represent the type of sample. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001.
