caption: 'Effects of Si-Miao-Yong-an (SMYA) on protein expression of the wnt1/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in aortic of as mice. Western blot analysis of Wnt1, β-catenin,
  Cyclin D1 and Gsk-3β. After SMYA intervention, the protein expression of Wnt1, β-catenin
  and Cyclin D1 was significantly decreased, while the expression of Gsk-3β protein
  had no significant change among the groups. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01,
  *p < 0.05, compared with the normal control (NC) group. ##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05, compared
  with the model group.'
