caption: Downstream effects analysis (DEA) for differentially expressed proteins in
  the PDM group, as compared to the NGT group, using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software. The analysis aims to identify biological functions that are expected
  to change in response to the protein expression patterns observed in the data. The
  algorithm is based on the calculation of an enrichment score and an activation Z-score
  [].
