caption: Effects of PQQ treatment on Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells in peripheral
  blood and lung tissues of asthmatic model mice. (a and b) The gating strategy of
  flow cytometry for blood and tissue. (c and d) Representative scatter diagrams in
  flow cytometry and quantitative analysis of the percentages of CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells
  in blood and lung tissues. (e and f) Representative scatter diagrams in flow cytometry
  and quantitative analysis of the percentages of CD4 + IL-4+ T cells in blood and
  lung tissues. (g and h) Representative scatter diagrams in flow cytometry and quantitative
  analysis of the percentages of CD4 + RORγt+ T cells in blood and lung tissues. (i
  and j) Representative scatter diagrams in flow cytometry and quantitative analysis
  of the percentages of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3+ T cells in blood and lung tissues. The
  columns and error bars represent the means and SEMs (n = 5 per group). ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments.
