caption: a Representative ELIC currents in response to 10 mM cysteamine of excised
  patches from 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG giant liposomes (black = WT, red = ELIC5, −60 mV
  holding voltage). The ELIC5 currents show sustained response to 10 mM cysteamine,
  followed by slow deactivation with the removal of cysteamine. b Inset that shows
  ELIC5 (red) single channel currents taken from the deactivation trace (i.e., channel
  closure) or WT (black) single channel currents in the presence of 10 mM cysteamine.
  c Cryo-EM density map of ELIC5 in 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG nanodiscs + 10 mM cysteamine
  (grey) with outer leaflet lipid density (yellow) and black lines approximating the
  bilayer. d View of the pore lining M2 helix from the extracellular side showing
  16’ (F247) and 9′ (L240) side chains from WT apo, WT CA (WT + 10 mM cysteamine),
  ELIC3 CA (ELIC3 + 10 mM cysteamine), and ELIC5 CA (ELIC5 + 10 mM cysteamine). All
  are structures in 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG nanodiscs. e Ion permeation pathway as determined
  by HOLE of the same structures shown in d. The ELIC5 CA structure shows rotamer
  2 for Q233 (see Supplementary Fig.  for a comparison of rotamers 1 and 2). Labeled
  are 16′, 9′, and 2′ side chains which form the narrowest portions of the pore in
  different structures. f Pore radius as a function of distance along the pore axis
  for the same structures as d and e.
