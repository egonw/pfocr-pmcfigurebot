caption: Tapinarof treatment reduces Tfh expansion and GC response in MRL/lpr mice.
  (A) Representative FACS pseudo‐color plots of the Tfh cell population (left). The
  results of the statistical analysis are shown on the right (n = 6–8). (B) Proportion
  of total B cells in the spleens of the three studied groups (n = 6–10). (C) Representative
  FACS pseudo‐color plots and the percentage of GC B cells in spleens (n = 7–9). (D)
  Proportion of CD4+CD69+ cells in the spleens and lymph nodes of the three studied
  groups (n = 7–10). (E) IL‐21 concentrations were detected in the plasma using an
  ELISA kit (n = 4–7). (F) Immunofluorescence of GCs from representative images of
  mouse spleen sections stained with PNA (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate), B220 (Alexa
  Fluor 568 conjugate), and DAPI among the three different treatments. The results
  of the statistical analysis are shown on the right (n = 5). The data were obtained
  from two independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD; *p < .05, **p < .01, and
  ***p < .001.
