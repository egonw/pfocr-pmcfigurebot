caption: Quercetin inhibits EMT-like mesenchymal transition and GBM invasion in vivo.
  (A) Illustration of in vivo studies of xenograft mouse model. (B) Images of dissected
  xenografted tumors implanted subcutaneously with U87MG after treatment with quercetin
  or TMZ for 21 days. n = 6. (C) The volume of tumor was measured 3-day intervals.
  n = 6. (D) Tumor weight was measured at the end of the study. n = 6. (E) The body
  weight of mice was monitored every 3 days. n = 6 (F) Ki67 staining was detected
  by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues. Scale bar = 50 μm. (G,H) Western blotting
  analysis of the expression of EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin)
  and the suppression of GSK-3β/β-catenin/zeb1 in tumor tissues. All data are shown
  as the mean ± SD. *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01 or ***p＜0.001 vs. control group.
