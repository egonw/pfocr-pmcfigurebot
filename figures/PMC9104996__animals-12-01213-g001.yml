caption: 'LRH-1 high expression in the atretic follicles. (A) Immunochemistry assay
  was performed to visualize the localization of LRH-1 in bovine ovarian cells. Immuno-specific
  staining was brown, indicating LRH-1-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed
  on three different ovarian slides from each of three bovines. Atretic follicles
  were indicated with the red arrow, whereas healthy follicles were indicated with
  black arrows. Bar: 200 μm. (B) The LRH-1 levels of granulosa cells in atretic follicles
  or healthy follicles. Data are shown as the means ± SEM of three biological replicates.
  ** p < 0.01, comparing the indicated groups. TCs, theca cells; GCs, granulosa cells.'
