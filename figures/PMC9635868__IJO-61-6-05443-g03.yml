caption: Knockdown of PPP1R14D inhibits the migration and invasion of LUAD cells.
  (A) Wound-healing assays were performed to evaluate the migration of cells, and
  the percentage of wound closure was calculated (scale bar, 100 µm). (B and E) Transwell
  and (C and F) Matrigel assays showed the effect of PPP1R14D expression levels on
  the migration and invasion abilities, respectively, of LUAD cells (scale bar, 100
  µm). (D) The migration- and invasion-related proteins MMP2, MMP9 and Vimentin were
  significantly downregulated after knockdown of PPP1R14D in A549 and PC-9 cells.
  GAPDH was used as the loading control. One-way ANOVA; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  vs. Scramble. PPP1R14D, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14D; LUAD, lung
  adenocarcinoma; sh-short hairpin.
article_title: PPP1R14D promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung
  adenocarcinoma via the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
