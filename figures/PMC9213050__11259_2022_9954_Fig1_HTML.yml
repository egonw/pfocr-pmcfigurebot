caption: PPV1 infection induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells. PK-15 cells were infected
  with PPV1 at MOI of 0.1 and 1 for 36 h. Mock-infected PK-15 cells were used as controls.
  PPV1-induced phosphatidylserine eversion detected by annexin V-FITC/PI staining
  and flow cytometry (a) and presented as a percentage of apoptotic cells (b), respectively.
  Results are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *0.01 < p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01
article_title: TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in PPV1-induced apoptosis
  in PK-15 cells.
