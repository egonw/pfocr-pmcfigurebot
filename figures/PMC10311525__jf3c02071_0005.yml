caption: Construction of the de novo biosynthetic pathway for (2S)-hesperetin in E.
  coli. (2S)-Eriodictyol, (2S)-isosakuranetin, and (2S)-hesperetin production, as
  well as OD600 readings of recombinant strains HE02 (harboring pGH29, pGH30, and
  pGH31), HE03 (harboring pGH21, pGH29, and pGH30), and HE04 (harboring pGH27, pGH29,
  and pGH30).
