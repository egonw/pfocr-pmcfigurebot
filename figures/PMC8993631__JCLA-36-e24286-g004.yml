caption: 'circ_0008194 could be directly bound by miR‐190a. (A) The detailed binding
  site between miRNA and circ_0008194. (B) miRNA expression level in cells. (C) The
  relative luciferase activities were detected in cells after co‐transfection with
  circRNA and miRNA, respectively. Data are all represented as mean ± SD (n = 3).
  (D) Anti‐Ago2 RIP assay was executed in cells after transfection followed by qRT‐PCR
  to detect circ_0008194. (E, F): Biotinylated circ_0008194 probe and a NC probe were
  used to pull down the candidate miRNAs and tested with quantitative real‐time PCR
  (n.s indicated no significance, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01)'
article_title: CircRNA_0008194 functions as a ceRNA to promote invasion of hepatocellular
  carcinoma via inhibiting miR‐190a/AHNAK signaling pathway.
