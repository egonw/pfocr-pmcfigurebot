figure_title: These four common human-nasal-associated Corynebacterium species have
  a largely shared metabolic capacity
caption: 'All genomes were analyzed using KEGG annotations of genes in each anvi’o
  contigs database with KEGG Orthology (KO) numbers from the KEGG KOfam database.
  Completion scores were calculated for each module in each genome ranging from 0–1
  representing the fraction of enzymes present out of total enzymes that make up each
  module. To identify the complete KEGG modules shared by the four common nasal Corynebacterium
  species, we ran a module enrichment analysis in which we assigned each genome a
  species group and compared whether that complete module was more likely to be found
  in one group or multiple groups. Modules with an adjusted p-value <0.05 were considered
  enriched in their associated species and modules that were not significantly enriched
  (adjusted p-value >0.05) in comparisons in three out of the four species, were categorized
  as shared. (A) Venn diagram summarizing complete (completion score ≥ 0.75) KEGG
  modules shared between the four Corynebacterium species: C. propinquum (Cpr), C.
  pseudodiphtheriticum (Cps), C. accolens (Cac), and C. tuberculostearicum (Ctu).
  Specific modules are grouped by the subgroup of ≤ 3 species encoding these and shown
  in boxes surrounding the Venn diagram with species labels. (B) Detailed list of
  the functions encompassed by the 50 KEGG modules shared by all four Corynebacterium
  species grouped by module category. In amino acid metabolism, gray indicates amino
  acids lacking complete biosynthesis modules; orange indicates that biosynthetic
  capabilities that vary by species (as influenced by predicted assimilatory sulfate
  reduction capabilities); deep pink indicates a predicted requirement for an exogenous
  source of either Asp or Asn; and light pink indicates the ability to make Met depends
  on either exogenous Asp or Asn. (C) Manual assessment for Corynebacterium orthologs
  predicted full biosynthetic pathway in several instances where KEGG annotations
  gave completion scores < 1. We performed blastX with enzymes with names in bold.
  (Ci) glycogen degradation and synthesis. (Cii) synthesis of UDP-glucose. (Ciii)
  Assimilatory sulfate reduction. Noted on the right side is the pathway defined in
  the KEGG module and on the left is the pathway identified in C. glutamicum by Ruckert,
  Kalinowski, and colleagues ().'
