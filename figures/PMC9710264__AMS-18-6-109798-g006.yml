caption: 'IL-6 was a direct target of miR-149. The putative binding sites between
  IL-6 and miR-149 were predicted by the bioinformatics algorithm TargetScan (A) and
  verified by luciferase reporter assays in MKN-28 and MGC-803 cells (B, C). After
  transfection with miR-149 mimics or inhibitors into MKN-28 and MGC-803 cells, the
  protein expression of IL-6 was measured by western blotting (D)*P < 0.05, #p < 0.05
  compared with corresponding control group.'
