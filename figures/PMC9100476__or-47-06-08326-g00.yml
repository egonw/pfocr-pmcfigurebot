caption: ICA suppresses the viability and colony formation ability of lung cancer
  cells but has little effect on lung epithelial cells. (A) CCK8 assays were performed
  to detect the proliferation ability of A549 cells and NCI-H1975 cells. (B) Colony
  formation assay was used to detect the colony formation ability of NCI-H1975 and
  A549 cells when treated with 40 µm ICA. (C) CCK8 and colony formation assay analyzed
  the effect of ICA on BEAS-2B cells. Results are represented as the mean ± SD of
  three experiments; *P<0.05 vs. control. ICA, icariin; CCK8, Cell Counting Kit-8.
article_title: Icariin inhibits the malignant progression of lung cancer by affecting
  the PI3K/Akt pathway through the miR-205-5p/PTEN axis.
