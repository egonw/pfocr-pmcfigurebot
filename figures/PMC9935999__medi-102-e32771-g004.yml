caption: 'Functional enrichment: KEGGâ€™s findings for enrichment of pathways. Enrichment
  findings for GO keywords showing 20 genes with upregulation and 20 genes with downregulation.
  By using Cluster Profiler, we were able to acquire enrichment findings for the KEGG
  pathway that showed 20 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes (version: 3.18.0).
  where the importance of the differential enrichment findings is shown by various
  hues depending on the color. The lower the FDR number, the greater the value being
  measured. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of genes that were
  enriched. The greater the number, the wider the circumference of the circle. In
  enrichment results, P & Lt; 0.05 or FDR & Lt; 0.05 is considered to be enriched
  to a meaningful pathway, that is, the right bar of the enrichment diagram -log10
  (P) is greater than 1.3. GO = gene ontology, KEGG = Kyoto encyclopedia of genes
  and genomes.'
