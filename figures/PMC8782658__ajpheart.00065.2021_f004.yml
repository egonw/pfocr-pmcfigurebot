caption: 'TNF-α-induced NO increases ICAM-1 immobile fraction. A: ICAM-1-GFP (grayscale,
  inverted contrast) was expressed in EAhy926 cells, and FRAP was recorded. Arrow
  depicts the FRAP region. Top shows FRAP without treatment applied. Middle shows
  ICAM-1-GFP FRAP after treatment with 1 nM TNF-α for 5 min. Bottom shows ICAM-1-GFP
  FRAP after pretreatment of the cells with l-NMA before TNF-α application for 5 min.
  B: recovery ICAM-GFP fluorescence curves after different treatments. C: quantification
  of the FRAP data show increase in the immobile fraction of ICAM-1-GFP following
  TNF-α treatment and inhibition of this effect by application of l-NMA. Two-way ANOVA
  and Bonferroni t test. *P < 0.05 in comparison to time 0, #P < 0.05 in comparison
  to the treatment with TNF-α; n = 5 independent experiments. FRAP, fluorescence recovery
  after photobleaching; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; l-NMA, NG-methyl-l-arginine;
  NO, nitric oxide; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.'
