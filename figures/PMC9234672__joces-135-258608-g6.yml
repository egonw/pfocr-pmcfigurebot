caption: Embryonic CGNPs are partially insensitive to Smoothened manipulation. (A)
  Box-and-whisker plot showing the relative cell counts of tdTomato+ (Tom+) CGNPs
  after 48 h of treatment with DMSO (control) or cyclopamine (5 µM) in E15.5 or P7
  CGNP primary cultures. n=8 biological replicates. (B) Box-and-whisker plot showing
  the average ratio of PCNA+/tdTomato+ cells after 48 h of treatment with DMSO (control)
  or purmorphamine (250 nM) in E15.5 or P7 CGNP primary cultures. E15, n=12; and P7,
  n=5 biological replicates. See also Fig. S3D. (C) Box-and-whisker plot showing the
  average ratio of PCNA+/tdTomato+ cells after 48 h of treatment with DMSO (control)
  or HPI1 (2.5 µM) in E15.5 or P7 CGNP primary cultures. E15, n=9; and P7, n=5 biological
  replicates. (D–D″) Results are given in box-and-whisker plots (purmorphamine) or
  represent median and complete range (HPI1). Plots show relative Gli1 (D), Cyclin
  D1 (Ccnd1) (D′), or Cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) (D″) mRNA expression levels compared to Gapdh
  in purmorphamine- (left graphs, 250 nM) or HPI1- (right graphs, 2.5 µM) treated
  E15.5 and P7 CGNPs, as determined by qRT-PCR. E15 purmorphamine, n=5; P7 purmorphamine,
  n=3; E15 HPI1, n=3; and P7 HPI1, n=3 biological replicates. See also Fig. S3E,F.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (paired, two-sided t-test). For the box-and-whisker
  plots, the box represents the 25–75th percentiles, and the median is indicated.
  The whiskers show the minimum to maximum. (E) Proposed model. SHH medulloblastoma
  derives from the CGNP population. CGNPs are specified in the rhombic lip (RL) of
  the early embryonic cerebellum, from where they migrate across the cerebellar surface
  to form the external granular layer (EGL). Upon terminal differentiation, CGNPs
  migrate inwards to form the definitive internal granular layer (IGL). Expression
  and length of primary cilia, which are important components of upstream SHH signaling,
  increases as CGNP development progresses. Thus, if oncogenic transformation takes
  place at late stages of CGNP development, SMO may be preferentially mutated as the
  primary cilia enhance oncogenic SMO activity. However, if CGNP oncogenic transformation
  occurs at an early embryonic stage, SUFU may be preferentially mutated, which controls
  downstream SHH signaling independently from the primary cilium. This implies that
  targeted therapy for infant SHH medulloblastoma should be directed towards downstream
  tumor-driving mechanisms.
