caption: The effects of the interleukin (IL)‐27 signal on the alteration of rheumatoid
  arthritis (RA) peripheral B cell homeostasis and functions. (a) Peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patients (n = 10) and healthy controls
  (HC, n = 9), and the expressions of gp130 and WSX‐1 (IL‐27 receptors) on CD19+ B
  cells were analyzed with flow cytometry assay. (b–e) RA CD19+ B cells were sorted
  with magnetic beads and stimulated with IL‐27 and anti‐CD40/cytosine–phosphate–guanosine
  (CpG) in the presence or absence of anti‐IL‐27 neutralizing antibody for 72 h, and
  the expressions of gp130 and WSX‐1 on CD19+ B cells (b), the frequencies of CD19+CD27+CD24highregulatory
  B cells (c), CD19+CD27+CD38high plasmablasts (d) and CD19+CD138+ plasma cells (e)
  were determined with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). (f,g) RA CD19+ B cells were stimulated
  for 72 h and the supernatants were collected, and the levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M,
  IgG, IL‐6 and IL‐10 were measured with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
  assay (n = 5). H, RA CD19+ B cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate
  succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cultured for 5 days, and B cell proliferation was
  analyzed with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). (i) The expression of CD80 and CD86
  on B cells was quantified with flow cytometry assay at 72 h (n = 5). **p < 0.01;

  by IL‐27 via activating the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in patients
