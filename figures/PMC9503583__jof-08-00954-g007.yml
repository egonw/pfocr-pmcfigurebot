caption: Expression profiles of genes involved in MAPK signaling pathways. RNA samples
  were isolated from vegetative hyphae of the wild-type strain Jt209 and the Î”Uvste50
  mutant cultured in regular PSB or PSB with 0.5 M NaCl or 0.05% H2O2. The expression
  level of each gene in the wild-type strain Jt209 cultured in regular PSB was arbitrarily
  set to 1.0. Mean and standard deviations were calculated considering the results
  of three independent replicates.
