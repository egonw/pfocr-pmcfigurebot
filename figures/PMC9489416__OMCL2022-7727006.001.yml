caption: RR inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro. (a) The chemical
  structural formula of RR; (b) The cell viability of different concentration gradients
  RR-stimulated BMMs after 48 h and 96 h. (c) BMMs were induced by RANKL with 25 ng/ml
  M-CSF and 50 ng/ml and stimulated with RR at different concentrations (0.375 μM,
  0.75 μM, and 1.5 μM) for 7 days. Osteoclast formation results were shown using TRAP
  staining, scale bar = 100 μm. (d) BMMs were induced with 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml
  RANKL for a total of 7 days, and 1.5 μM RR was added at indicated periods of induction.
  TRAP staining results were shown, scale bar = 100 μm. (e, f) Quantitative results
  of multinuclear TRAP-positive cell numbers and the area occupied. (g) The BMMs were
  planted in a 96-well plate with approximately 8 × 103 cells per well and stimulated
  with 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL for 5 days while adding the different concentrations
  of RR described above. The cells were fixed with PFA and after 1% Triton 100× membrane
  breakdown. F-actin ring was stained with phalloidin, scale bar = 100 μm. (h) Quantitative
  analysis of the circumference of the F-actin ring using Image J software. (i) Representative
  image of osteoclast bone absorption pits, scale bar = 500 μm. (j) Quantification
  of bone absorption pits in different groups. Data was presented as means ± SEM;
  n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
