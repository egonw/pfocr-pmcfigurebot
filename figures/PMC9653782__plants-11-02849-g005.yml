caption: 'Volcano plots and KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment map of differential
  metabolites. (A,C) Positive ion mode, (B,D) Negative ion mode; each point represents
  a metabolite: horizontal coordinates indicate different multiplicities of differential
  metabolites (log2 values), vertical coordinates indicate p-values (−log10 values),
  grey indicates metabolites with no significant differences (NoDiff), red indicates
  up–regulated metabolites (UP), green indicates down–regulated metabolites (DW),
  and the size of the points indicates VIP values. The abscissa in the figure is x/y
  (the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding metabolic pathway/the
  total number of metabolites identified in the pathway), and the larger the value,
  the higher the enrichment of differential metabolites in the pathway. The color
  of the point represents the p-value of the hypergeometric test. The smaller the
  value, the more reliable and statistically significant the test is. The size of
  the dots represents the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding
  pathway; the larger the number, the more differential metabolites in the pathway.'
