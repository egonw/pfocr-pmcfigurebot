figure_title: KDM5B activates cell cycle pathway of Ewing sarcoma cells and promotes
  protein expression of CCNE1
caption: 'A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showing activated cell cycle pathway
  by KDM5B in a merged dataset of GSE17674, GSE12102 and GSE34620. B KEGG enrichment
  analysis for RNA sequencing in A673 and RDES cells after vehicle or AS-8351 treatment.
  C Western blot analysis showing the expression of the key molecules of G1/S phase
  transition, CCNE1, CCNE2 and CDK2, and FLI1 in A673 and RDES cells after shKDM5B
  treatment. D Western blot analysis showing the expression of CCNE1, CCNE2 and CDK2,
  in A673 and RDES cells after AS-8351 treatment. E Western blot analysis of the protein
  expression in shKDM5B Ewing sarcoma cells treated with or without CCNE1-overexpression.
  F Up panel: Representative images of colony formation assays in shKDM5B Ewing sarcoma
  cells treated with or without CCNE1-overexpression. Down panel: Histogram of three
  biological independent experiments of colony formation assays. G Growth curves of
  shKDM5B Ewing sarcoma cells A673 and RDES treated with or without CCNE1-overexpression.
  H Relative mRNA expression of CCNE1 in shKDM5B Ewing sarcoma cells. Error bars in
  F, G, H indicate standard deviation of three biological independent experiments.
  P values in F, H are determined by two‐tailed unpaired Student’s t test. P values
  in G are determined by two‐way ANOVA test. *Above the bars indicates significant
  difference; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; n.s. represents
  no significance.'
