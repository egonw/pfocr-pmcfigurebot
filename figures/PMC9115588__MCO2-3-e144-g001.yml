caption: Regulation of EMT via canonical or noncanonical Wnt pathway. In canonical
  Wnt pathway, nuclear β‐catenin/LEF/TCF transcriptional complex activates the transcription
  of EMT‐TFs, thus regulating EMT. In turn, EMT‐TFs affect Wnt signaling to form feedback
  loops. For example, Snail/β‐catenin complex activates transcription of TCF1, which
  is the key transcription factor of Wnt signaling. ZEB represses the transcription
  of miR‐200a, leading to the reactivation of β‐catenin. Twist can transcribe Wnt5a,
  which activates Wnt receptor Frizzled. In noncanonical Wnt pathway, activation of
  Frizzled2 leads to the phosphorylation and consequent nuclear translocation of STAT3,
  which upregulates mesenchymal marks and represses epithelial marks independent of
  β‐catenin
