caption: 'Arginine deprivation signaling pathways. In contrast to arginine stimulation,
  arginine deprivation suppresses mTOR pathway via activation of AMPK. Additionally,
  arginine deprivation induces p38-signaling pathway, which impairs mitochondria functions.
  Arginine deprivation also can induce ER stress via GCN2, resulting in aspartate
  exhaustion and decreased DNA synthesis. In general, arginine deprivation causes
  cancer cell death. EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
