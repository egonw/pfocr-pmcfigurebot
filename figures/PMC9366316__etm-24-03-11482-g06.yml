caption: Pretreatment with CC partially reverses the protective effect of Rg1 on ox-LDL-induced
  HUVECs. (A) SA-β-gal staining was used to detect the senescence of HUVECs (magnification,
  x200). (B) Quantified number of senescent cells. (C) Western blot analysis was used
  to detect the expression of senescence-related proteins. (D) Related kits were used
  to detect the expression of oxidative stress indicators. (E) ELISA was performed
  to detect the release of inflammatory cytokines. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial
  cell; Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1; CC, compound C; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase.
