caption: 'Effects of HBOT on the protein expression of inflammatory mediators in mid-brain
  tissue of MPTP-treated mice. Protein expression of (A) NF-κB p65, (B) COX-2, (C)
  iNOS and (D) TNF-α were detected by Western blotting. All data are expressed as
  mean ± SEM (n = 3). # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 compared with the
  control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 compared with the MPTP
  group.'
