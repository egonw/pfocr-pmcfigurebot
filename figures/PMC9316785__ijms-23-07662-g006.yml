caption: 'MoNAP1 is involved in the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway and microtubule
  dynamics. (A) Mycelial colonies of the wild type, ∆Monap1 and Monap1c strains cultured
  in CM containing 75 μg mL−1 CFW, 600 μg mL−1 CR, 0.004% SDS, 35 μg mL−1 BLM, 15
  μg mL−1 benomyl, and 2 mM HU in darkness at 25 °C for 9 days. For the temperature-sensitivity
  assay, the wild type, ∆Monap1 and Monap1c strains were cultured in CM at 25 °C or
  32 °C under a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle for 9 d. (B) Relative growth rate (%)
  of mycelial colonies in 75 μg mL−1 CFW, 600 μg mL−1 CR, 0.004% SDS and 35 μg mL−1
  BLM, 15 μg mL−1 benomyl, 2 mM HU and 32 °C growing conditions. n = 5 independent
  biological replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviations. The data were
  analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 and significant differences compared with the wild
  type were estimated by multiple t tests: ** p < 0.01.'
