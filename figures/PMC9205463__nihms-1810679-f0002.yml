caption: '(A) Western blot assays of WT and DDX41 KO HeLa cell lines with the indicated
  antibodies. β-actin serves as a loading control.(B and C) qPCR analysis of the gene
  expression of IFN-β (B) and ISG56 (C) in WT and DDX41 KO HeLa cell lines after poly(dA:dT)
  treatment. GAPDH serves as an internal control, and time 0 was set as 1.(D and E)
  Western blot assays of proteins in the cGAS-STING pathway after poly(dA:dT) treatment
  in WT (D) and DDX41 KO (E) HeLa cell lines.(F–I) Quantification of the relative
  expression of cGAS (F), p-STING (G), p-TBK1 (H), and p-IRF3 (I).(J) Western blot
  assays of WT and DDX41 KO THP-1 cell lines with the indicated antibodies.(K) qPCR
  analysis of IFN-β gene expression in WT and DDX41 KO THP-1 macrophages after poly(dA:dT)
  treatment.(L) IFN-β protein detected by an ELISA kit (414,101, R&D Systems) in WT
  and DDX41 KO THP-1 macrophages after poly(dA:dT) treatment.(M) qPCR analysis of
  ISG56 gene expression in WT and DDX41 KO THP-1 macrophages after poly(dA:dT) treatment.(N)
  IRF-induced luciferase activity measured in WT and DDX41 KO THP-1 macrophages after
  poly(dA:dT) treatment.(O and P) Western blot assays of proteins in the cGAS-STING
  pathway in WT (O) and DDX41 KO (P) THP-1 macrophages after poly(dA:dT) treatment.(Q–T)
  Quantification of the relative expression of cGAS (Q), p-STING (R), p-TBK1 (S),
  and p-IRF3 (T).For (B), (C), (F)–(I), (K)–(N), and (Q)–(T): data represent the mean
  ± SEM of three independent experiments.'
