caption: The mechanisms and pathways of ALPK1-related cancer development and metastasis.
  TNF-α and NF-κβ are the primary mechanisms through which the novel ALPK1 pathway
  contributes to cancer. In the initial stage, ALPK1 acts upstream to regulate TNF-α,
  which then activates NF-κB-associated cancers. During the progression stage, a novel
  pathway involves ALPK1 translocation to the nucleus to promote cancer cell invasion
  and metastasis through the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).
