caption: 'The mutation landscape of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A in hepatocellular
  carcinoma based on cBioPortal database. A: OncoPrint plot indicated different types
  and proportions of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) mutations; B and
  C: The association between CDKN2A copy number and mRNA expression are shown in the
  dot plot (B) and correlation plot (C); D: Demonstration of mutation sites, mutation
  types, and mutation cases on the two-dimensional structure of the CDKN2A protein;
  E: The cell cycle pathway mapper of CDKN2A in hepatocellular carcinoma. CDKN2A:
  Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A.'
