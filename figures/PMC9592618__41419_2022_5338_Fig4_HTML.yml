figure_title: The KIF15 and PI3K-C2α interaction is essential for integrin recycling
  on RAB11A-activated endosomes
caption: A, B Proteins that interacted with KIF15 were identified by silver staining
  and mass spectrometry. C Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the interaction between
  KIF15 and Rab11, PI3K-C2α, RAB11A, integrin β1. D Schematic model of the domain
  structure of wild-type KIF15 (KIF15-WT) and KIF15 mutants depleting either aa19-375
  (KIF15-Δmtor) or aa1149-1388(KIF15-ΔC-term). E Wild-type KIF15 and different mutation
  constructs plasmid were transfected into PC cells, anti-Flag antibody was used for
  the co-immunoprecipitation, and substrate proteins were detected using western blot.
  F The effect of KIF15 or KIF15-ΔC-term interacted with PI3K-C2α on the integrin
  β1/FAK pathway activity in whole cell lysis by western blot and the interaction
  of KIF15, Rab11A Integrin β1, PI3K-C2α by Flag or HA immunoprecipitation assay.
  G Immunofluorescence analysis of the interaction of KIF15-WT or KIF15-ΔC-term with
  PI3K-C2α on the depolymerization of focal adhesions in PANC-1 cell. H Western blot
  analysis of the effects of KIF15 and PI3K-C2α complexes on integrin signaling in
  the wild-type or inactive state of RAB11A. All data represent means ± SEM; ***P < 0.001,
  **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; two-tailed Student’s t test.
