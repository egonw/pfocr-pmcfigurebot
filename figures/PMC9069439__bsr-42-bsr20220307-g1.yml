figure_title: Up-regulation of ER stress marker and TLR4 in intestinal tissues of
  IBD model
caption: '(A) DAI scores in three groups of mice (n=5). (B) Immunohistochemical analysis
  of GRP78 in the intestine of three groups of mice. (C) Immunohistochemical analysis
  of TLR4 in the intestine of three groups of mice. Staining intensity was quantified
  by ImageJ software and illustrated as bar charts (n=5). *P<0.05 compared with control.
  # P<0.05 compared with TNBS+NS.'
