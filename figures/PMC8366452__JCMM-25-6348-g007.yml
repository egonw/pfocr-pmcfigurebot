caption: Heatmap view of miR‐193b‐related signalling pathways and pathway analysis
  of 5 selected genes. A, Pathway analysis of 5 selected genes using KEGG and Reactome
  libraries. The top 10 enriched pathway terms are displayed in a bar graph ranked
  by a combined score calculated by P‐value. The length of the bar and the brightness
  of its colour represent the significance of the specific pathway. B, The heatmap
  demonstrates miR‐193b‐associated pathways according to DIANA miRPath v.3. Here,
  P‐value marks the inspected signalling pathways which are significantly enriched
  with miRNA targets. Additionally, colour gradient represents pathway value with
  red, as the highest importance, and pale yellow, as the lowest
