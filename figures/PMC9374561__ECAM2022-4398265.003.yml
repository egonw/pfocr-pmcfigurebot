caption: Inhibitory effect of rhein on SHH signaling pathway in UUO rats. Rhein group
  rats were administered rhein 2 mg·kg−1·d−1 by oral gavage for 14-d sham group, and
  UUO group rats were administered equal volumes of water. SHH, Gli1, and Snail protein
  and mRNA expression levels were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
