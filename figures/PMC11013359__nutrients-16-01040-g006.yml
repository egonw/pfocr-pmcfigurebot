caption: Free Amino Acid-Based Diet inhibits carcinogenic signaling in colon tissues
  of ApcMin/+ mice. (A) Presents a volcano plot illustrating upregulation of multiple
  genes in the FAA group, notably including Egln3 (n = 5 per group). (B) Demonstrates
  pathway enrichment analysis for downregulated differential genes, predominantly
  in the Hippo, mTOR, and Wnt signaling pathways (n = 5 per group). (C) Displays a
  Venn diagram of enriched pathways from differential genes and differential metabolites,
  providing a comprehensive view of the interconnected pathways affected by the FAA
  diet at both the genetic and metabolic levels. (D) Kaplan–Meier plotter, indicating
  that upregulation of the EGLN 3 gene is associated with increased PPS, with a statistical
  significance of p = 0.015. (E) Reports the expression levels of the target gene
  EGLN 3 in cells post 48-h treatment with DPA, as determined by quantitative PCR
  (qPCR) analysis. (F) The correlation between differential metabolites and differential
  genes. The horizontal axis represents differential genes, and the vertical axis
  represents differential metabolites. (G) Features a multicolor immunohistochemical
  fluorescence image, with Egln3 stained in red, Ki-67 in green, and nuclei counterstained
  with DAPI in blue. Significance is denoted as *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001, determined
  by Student’s t-test, lending credibility to the observed differences.
