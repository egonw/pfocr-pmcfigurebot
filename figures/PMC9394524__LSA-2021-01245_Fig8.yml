figure_title: RGS and Kel1 form a complex and are in the same genetic pathway for
  regulation of cytokinesis
caption: (A) Cells expressing Kel1-GFP and overexpressing RGS (pRSII416 pADH Sst2-3xFLAG)
  as either WT, ᵽRGS, or p*RGS were treated with pheromone for 1 h, lysed, and an
  immunoprecipitation was performed with a GFP antibody resin (GFP-trap). Westerns
  blots were probed for FLAG-RGS and for Kel1-GFP. Input lanes contain lysate equivalent
  to 10% of protein used for the immunoprecipitation. (B) Quantitation of the immunoprecipitation
  results from eight separate experiments. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
  Because these confidence intervals overlap, statistical significance was tested
  by bootstrapping the 95% confidence interval of the difference in means. (C) Our
  data thus far lead us to the hypothesis that unphosphorylated RGS binds Kel1, inhibiting
  it, and that phosphorylated RGS binds less well, allowing more Kel1 to function
  for cytokinesis. This can be tested by overexpressing the unphosphorylatable ᵽRGS,
  which we would expect to decrease the delay in polarized growth and lead to increased
  cytokinetic defects. This hypothesis can also be tested by attempting to rescue
  cytokinetic defects in the ᵽRGS mutant by overexpressing Kel1. (D) We performed
  hydroxyurea and pheromone experiments as in , with overexpression of WT and mutant
  RGS constructs from pRSII416 pADH RGS-3xFlag, as above. Graphed is the percentage
  of cells that carried out a normal response as previously defined. The green bars
  are data from  for comparison. Error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence
  intervals. Data consist of n = 1784 cells for WT RGS, n = 2,398 for ᵽRGS, and n
  = 1,951 for p*RGS overexpression from three different experiments. (D, E) We carried
  out the same experiments in (D) but with Kel1 overexpressed in WT or mutant RGS
  backgrounds from pRSII416 pADH Kel1-3xFLAG. Green bars are data from  for comparison.
  Error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Data consist of n =
  1,936 cells for WT RGS, n = 2,251 for ᵽRGS and n = 2,574 for p*RGS from three different
  experiments.
