caption: Schematic physiopathological model of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and its
  relationship with the NFkB pathway. The tumor cells that drive classical Hodgkin
  lymphoma (cHL) are Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. These B cells are isolated
  from the germinal center and are rescued from apoptosis despite unproductive or
  crippled IgV by mechanisms that involve Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or NFkB deregulation.
  Interaction with the microenvironment, including mainly T cells but also mastocytes,
  macrophages, and myeloid cells, creates an interaction that favors HRS cell survival.
  The NFkB pathway is deregulated by multiple mechanisms, including NFkB signaling
  activation through genetic lesions, interaction with microenvironment cells, and
  TNF receptor activation or EBV activation. The deregulation of the NFkB pathway
  is involved in the transcriptional control of several target genes involved in apoptosis,
  the JAK/STAT pathway, B-cell marker expression loss, microenvironment crosstalk,
  or cell proliferation. Figure generated using Servier Medical Art and personal archive
  PET scan imaging.
