caption: Cytotoxic effect of AWGP and KCWGP in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 myoblasts received
  AWGP and KCWGP treatments ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/ml for 24 h. MTT assay determined
  cell viability. The values from the triplicate of experiments are given as the mean
  Â± standard error of mean. (A) AWGP. (B) KCWGP. AWGP, American wild ginseng pharmacopuncture;
  KCWGP, Korean cultivated wild ginseng pharmacopuncture.
article_title: Effects of American wild ginseng and Korean cultivated wild ginseng
  pharmacopuncture extracts on the regulation of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation through
  AMPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
