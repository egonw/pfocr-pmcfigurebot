caption: 'IL-6 expression is inhibited in lung tissues. (a) The photomicrographs of
  immunohistochemical staining for IL-6 among lung tissue samples are displayed. The
  nucleus is colored in blue and the positive cells are colored in brown (scale bar
  is 50 µm, ×400). (b) The relative IL-6 gene expression. (c) Western blot analysis
  of IL-6 in lung tissues. Each group in the strip chart is consistent with the below
  semiquantitative analysis on the basis of the intensity of the strip chart. Error
  bars represent SD, n = 3. ∗, #, &, and Δ represent P values <0.05 which are considered
  statistically significant. ∗ versus MC (model control), # versus herbs low, & versus
  herbs mid, and Δ versus herbs high.'
