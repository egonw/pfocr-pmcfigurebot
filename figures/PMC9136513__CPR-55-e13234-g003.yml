caption: The osteogenic differentiation potential was decreased in OP‐BMSCs. (A) ALP
  staining showed less alkaline phosphatase activity in OP‐BMSCs after osteogenic
  induction for 3 and 5 days. (B) Alizarin red staining showed fewer mineralized nodules
  after osteogenic induction for 21 days. (C) Semi‐quantitative analysis of ALP staining,
  Alizarin red staining by utilizing ImageJ. (D) Immunofluorescence staining for RUNX2
  after osteogenic induction for 3 days. (E) Immunofluorescence staining for OPN after
  osteogenic induction for 3 days. (F) Semi‐quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence
  staining by utilizing ImageJ. Data represent the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01,
