caption: Schematic of the main biosynthetic pathways in plants to achieve phenols
  and polyphenols. Shikimic acid is the precursor of simple phenols and phenylpropanoids
  (hydroxycinnamic acid, coumarin lignans and lignins), which upon reacting with polyketides
  by acetate/malonate pathway favours the synthesis of flavonoids, stilbenes, flavolignans,
  and structurally related compounds. Terpenoid quinones are also produced when shikimic
  acid derivatives react with polyisoprenyl chains. The acetate pathway leads to fatty
  acid biosynthesis, by FAS enzyme, or poly-Î²-keto chains, which upon undergoing intramolecular
  reaction by polyketide synthase, leads to simple phenols, generally characterized
  by meta-substitution, or more complex compounds such as anthraquinones and aflatoxins.
  Three units of acetyl CoA combined by Claisen and aldol reactions lead to mevalonic
  acid, from which isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) or dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP) are synthetized. Methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) is also a precursor
  of IPP/DMAPP. The two isoprene units are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes,
  classified according to number of carbons. Essential oils (EOs), which are mixtures
  of low-molecular-weight terpenes, as well as triterpenic saponins, are deeply investigated
  for their pharmacological applications and different actions on ruminant health
  [,]. Alkaloids are biosynthesized by different precursors (the main classes from
  anthranilic acid, aromatic amino acids, ornithine and lysine are indicated). GGPP
  = geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GFPP = geranyl farnesyl diphosphate.
