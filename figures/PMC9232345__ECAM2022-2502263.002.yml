caption: 'β-Carotene inhibits LPS-induced apoptosis and autophagy in IEC-6 cells.
  Cells were treated with LPS (100 μM) for 3 h prior to exposure to β-carotene (10,
  20, and 30 μM) for 24 h. (a) Cell viability measured by the CCK-8 assay.  ∗ ∗P <
  0.01 vs. the control group. ##P < 0.01 vs. the LPS group. (b), (c) Apoptosis was
  quantified by flow cytometry.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 vs. the LPS group. ##P < 0.01 vs. the
  LPS + 20 μM βC group. (d)–(g) The expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3,
  LC3II/I, and p62 detected by Western blot.  ∗P < 0.05,  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 vs. the LPS
  group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. the LPS group. (h) Representative images of intracellular
  GFP-LC3 puncta in IEC-6 cells under different conditions. The images were made at × 100
  magnification. Each experiment is carried out in triplicate.'
