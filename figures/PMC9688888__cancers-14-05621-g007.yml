caption: Calculating the synergistic concentrations required for a combination treatment
  with GS and BTZ. U266 cells were treated with 5, 10, 25, and 50 μM of GS or 5,10,
  25, and 50 nM of BTZ alone or in different combinations to calculate the synergistic
  apoptotic response of GS and BTZ at 48 h. The concentration and fraction effect
  (A,B) graphs were created using CalcuSyn software. CI were calculated by employing
  Chou and Talalay’s methodology [].
