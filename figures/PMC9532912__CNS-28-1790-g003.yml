caption: (A) At 2 h/7 days after ischemia–reperfusion, ZnCl2 was continuously intraperitoneally
  injected to 14, 21, and 28 days after ischemia–reperfusion, behavioral observations
  were performed on 14, 21, and 28 days after ischemia–reperfusion. (B,C) The cortical
  width index results showed that zinc reduces ischemia‐induced brain atrophy. (D)
  Tape removal test results showed that zinc reduces tape removal time and promotes
  nerve function recovery. (E) The results of the forelimb stepping experiment showed
  that zinc treatment decreased the number of forelimb stepping and suggested the
  promotion of nerve function recovery. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 6/group)
