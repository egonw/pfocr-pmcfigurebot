caption: 'Cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS) knockdown inhibited cell growth
  via the C3 pathway and was associated with the prognosis of triple‐negative breast
  cancer (TNBC). (A) Comparison of the mRNA expression level of CAS between TNBC and
  non‐TNBC samples in the GSE65194 dataset (Probe ID: 201111_at). (B) Representative
  Western blot of CAS knockdown after lentiviral transduction for 48 and 144 h. shCAS,
  CAS knockdown; shNC, scramble control. (C) Representative images of the EdU incorporation
  assay 168 h post transfection. (D) Statistical analysis of MDA‐MB‐231 cell proliferation
  as evaluated by an EdU incorporation assay. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM
  (****P < 0.0001). (E) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of cell cycle
  proteins in CAS knockdown cells. (F) Colony formation assay to determine the effects
  of CAS knockdown in MDA‐MB‐231 cells. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM
  (***P < 0.001). (G) Representative images of tumours in female BALB/c nude mice
  bearing MDA‐MB‐231 cells expressing shNC and shCAS (left) and a photograph of the
  xenograft mouse model (right). (H) Decreased tumour index (tumour weight/body weight)
  in the shCAS group. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM (***P < 0.001). (I)
  Heatmap analysis of genes related to complement and coagulation cascades. shCAS,
  CAS knockdown; shNC, scramble control. (J) Real‐time PCR validation of the RNA‐seq
  results. (K) Expression analysis of C3 in breast cancer using the GEPIA2 database.
  (L) Correlation analysis of C3 expression and CAS expression in breast cancer using
  the TIMER database. (M) Kaplan–Meier analysis of overall survival for breast cancer
  patients with high (red line, n = 400) and low (blue line, n = 400) C3 mRNA expression
  as determined in the GEPIA2 database. (N) Schematic diagram of CAS regulates cell
  proliferation and C3 singling pathway in TNBC cells'
