caption: 'Stable CYP27C1-knockdown promotes human lung cancer cell proliferation in
  vitro, and in xenograft mice model. (A,B) Cell viability of A549-shCYP27C1, H1975-shCYP27C1,
  and the corresponding control cells was detected by MTS assay at different time
  points. Time-cell proliferation curves were plotted, and analyzed by two-way ANOVA.
  ****, p < 0.0001. (C) BALB/c nude mice (N = 10) were divided into two groups. H1975-shCYP27C1
  cells were injected into the right armpit of the mice in experimental group, whereas
  H1975-shCtrl cells were injected into mice in control group. Tumor formed on the
  ninth day. Length (l) and width (w) of the tumor was measured on 12, 15, 18, 22,
  24, and 26 days after injection. Tumor volume was calculated by formula: V = (l×w2)/2.
  Time-tumor volume curve was plotted, and analyzed by two-way ANOVA. n.s., p > 0.05.
  (D) Mice were sacrificed on the twenty-seventh day after injection. Mice were dissected,
  tumor weight was measured, and analyzed with Mann–Whitney test. *, p < 0.05. (E)
  Histology (hematoxylin-eosin staining) of representative xenograft tumor in nude
  mice model. Magnification: 50× (panel 1,3); 200× (panel 2,4).'
