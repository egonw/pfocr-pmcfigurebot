caption: 'Deoxyschizandrin inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
  bladder cancer cells by downregulating ALOX5 and affecting the downstream PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway. (a and b) CCK-8 assay showed that negative control (NC) or sh-NC
  or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  could regulate HT1376 cells'' proliferation. (c and d) Wound healing assay showed
  that negative control (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5
  or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5 could regulate HT1376 cells'' migration.
  (e and f) Wound healing assay showed that negative control (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin
  or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5 could regulate
  J82 cells'' migration. (g and h) Transwell assay showed that negative control (NC)
  or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  could regulate HT1376 cells'' invasion. (i and j) Transwell assay showed that negative
  control (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  could regulate J82 cells'' invasion. (k and l) BALB/c nude mice injected into HT1376
  cells had smaller volume tumor xenografts with negative control (NC) or sh-NC or
  Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  treatment. (m) Ki-67 assay showed that negative control (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin
  or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5 treatment by BALB/c
  nude mice injected into HT1376 cells. (n) HE stain revealed that negative control
  (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  treatment by BALB/c nude mice injected into HT1376 cells. (o and p) Western blot
  analysis; the expression levels of AKT, PI3K, p-AKT, and P-PI3K were treated negative
  control (NC) or sh-NC or Deoxyschizandrin or overexpression-ALOX5 or Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5
  in HT1376 and J82 cells. Data represent mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 and #p < 0.05 compared
  with Deoxyschizandrin+overexpression-ALOX5.'
