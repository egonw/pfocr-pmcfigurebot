caption: TRIM52 is upregulated in tumor tissues analyzed by TCGA database. (A) Expression
  of TRIM52 in 286 colon cancer tissues and 41 normal tissues were analyzed by TCGA
  database, TRIM52 is upregulated in tumor tissues (P<0.05). (B) Expression of TRIM52
  in normal colon epithelial tissues and each stage of colon cancer was analyzed by
  TCGA database data. (C) Survival analysis of patients with high and low expression
  of TRIM52 in tumor tissues by TCGA database. TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
