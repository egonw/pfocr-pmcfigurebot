caption: Z734 downregulates the expression of ERK2 in MCF–7 cells. (A) MCF–7 cells
  were treated with Z734 (10 μM for 12 h). The expression levels of p–JAK, JAK, p–JNK,
  JNK, p–AKT, AKT, p–ERK, ERK, and GAPDH were determined via Western blotting. (B)
  Effects of Z734 on kinase activity of ERK1, ERK2, and MEK1. (C) Western blot analysis
  of the p–ERK2 and ERK2 expressions in MCF–7 cells exposed to 0, 5, 10, and 15 μM
  of Z734 for 12 h. Relative protein expression was normalized to GAPDH. (D) Western
  blot analysis of the p–ERK2 and ERK2 expressions in MCF–7 cells treated with Z734
  (10 μM) for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. (E,F) MCF–7 cells were exposed to Z734 (10 μM) for
  12 h and were then stained with antibodies for ERK2 and p53. DAPI was used to stain
  the nuclei. Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope. Quantification
  of fluorescence was performed on the average optical density using the ImageJ software.
  Scale bars = 10 μm. Data shown in (E,F) were used two–tailed Student’s t–test. All
  assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are expressed as mean ± standard
  deviation. ** p < 0.01.
