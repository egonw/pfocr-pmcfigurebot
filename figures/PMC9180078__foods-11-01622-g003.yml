caption: Effects of RRBE on the interferon-inducible gene expression. (A) The luminescence
  activity through STING signaling was determined after DMXAA activation with and
  without RRBE for 3, 6 and 24 h (N = 3–5). The relative mRNA expressions (normalized
  by actin) of (B) Ifn-α, (C) Mx1, (D) Cxcl10, (E) Irf3, (F) Irf5 and (G) Irf7 after
  DMXAA stimulation with and without RRBE for 3 h (N = 3–4) are shown. Error bars
  indicate SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
