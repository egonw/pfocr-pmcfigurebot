caption: 'Inhibition of ROS by NAC suppressed TMAO-induced NF-κB activation. (A,B)
  The phosphorylation of p65, and the protein expression levels of c-Fos, NFATc1 were
  promoted under 400 μM TMAO and suppressed by NAC with or without TMAO treatment
  as examined by Western blot (n = 3 per group). (C,D) BMMs were pretreated with 30
  mM NAC for 1 h before being cultured with or without 400 µM TMAO. The numbers of
  TRAP-positive osteoclasts increased with 400 μM TMAO and decreased with NAC pretreatment
  with or without TMAO. Scale bar = 20 µm. (E) The expression of the osteoclast-specific
  genes was promoted under 400 μM TMAO and suppressed by NAC with or without TMAO
  treatment as evaluated by real-time PCR (n = 3 per group). * p < 0.05, #p < 0.01.'
