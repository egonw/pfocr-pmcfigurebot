caption: Western blot analysis of STAT proteins. The MG-63 cells were incubated for
  72 h on T or Z discs or in wells without any discs. The cells were left untreated
  (negative control) or treated with an appropriate cytokine for 20 min. (A) Stimulation
  with IFN-α or IFN-γ. The membranes after the transfer of separated proteins were
  probed with anti-phospho-STAT1 (upper part) and anti-STAT1 antibodies (lower part);
  (B) stimulation with IFN-α or IL-6. Phospho-STAT3 and STAT3 proteins were detected
  using phospho-STAT3 and STAT3 antibodies, respectively (upper and lower part); (C)
  stimulation with IL-4 and detection of phospho-STAT6 and STAT6 proteins (upper and
  lower part). The protein lysates of ARPE-19 cells were used as a positive control
  for the detection of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated STAT proteins.
