caption: Pain stimulates nociceptors and cytokines are released into the bloodstream
  to activate the 1st order neuron in the ascending pathway which synapses with the
  2nd order neuron at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The 2nd order neuron synapses
  with the 3rd order neuron at the thalamus. The signal is then relayed to the somatosensory
  cortex and the descending pathway is activated to release substance P at the dorsal
  horn resulting in the sensation of pain.
