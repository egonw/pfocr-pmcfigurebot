caption: 'Significantly altered pathway expression changes among the 21 HDE and saline-
  exposed mouse lungs. NanoString Advanced Analysis was performed and the z-scores
  for each sample pertaining to generalized cancer and immunological-related pathways
  were assessed including: (A) inflammation (B) cancer progression (C) innate immunity
  (D) adaptive immunity (E) adhesion (F) Macrophage cell functions. The * symbol above
  the HDE bars represents significance against all saline-treated conditions within
  each respective NNK-group; (*** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001).'
