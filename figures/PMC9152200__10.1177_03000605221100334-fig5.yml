caption: Analysis of the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway. (a) Western blotting
  showing the expression of DRD2, SLC6A3, and COMT proteins. GADPH was used as a loading
  control. (b), (c), and (d) The light blue bars represent the expression of DRD2,
  SLC6A3, and COMT in group C. The dark blue bars represent the expression of DRD2,
  SLC6A3, and COMT in group M. (e) and (f) mRNA expression of DRD2 and SLC6A3 in rat
  penile samples. Values are the mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 10 animals
  per group). The t-test was used. Group M was compared with group C, * represents
  P < 0.05.DRD2, dopamine receptor D2; SLC6A3, solute carrier family 6 member 3; COMT,
  catechol-O-methyltransferase; GAPDH, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; C, control;
  M, model; OD, optical density.
