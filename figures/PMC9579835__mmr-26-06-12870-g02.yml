caption: Resveratrol reverses EMT in colon cancer cells via regulation of the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail
  signaling pathway in vitro (1=NC-control, 2=NC-resveratrol, 3=si-AKT1-control, 4=si-AKT1-resveratrol
  group). Cells were subjected to the same drug treatments as those used in the scratch
  wound healing assay. Expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, p-AKT1, AKT1, p-GSK-3β,
  GSK-3β, and Snail was evaluated in (A-C) SW480 cells and (D-F) SW620 cells subjected
  to various treatments via western blotting. In comparison with that in the NC-control
  group, E-cadherin expression was upregulated in the NC-resveratrol and si-AKT1-control
  groups, whereas the expression of N-cadherin, p-AKT, p-GSK-3β, and Snail was downregulated.
  However, there was no difference in the expression of these proteins between the
  si-AKT1-resveratrol and si-AKT1-control groups. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and
  NS (P>0.05) compared with the respective control; n=3. These data were evaluated
  by one-way ANOVA. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; GSK, glycogen synthase
  kinase; p-, phosphor-; NC, negative control; si-, small interfering-; NS, not significant.
