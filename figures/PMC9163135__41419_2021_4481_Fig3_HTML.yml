figure_title: SNAI2 promotes the proliferation of GSCs
caption: A The overexpression and knockdown efficiency of SNAI2 in GSCs validated
  with RT-qPCR. B The overexpression and knockdown efficiency of SNAI2 in GSCs as
  detected by Western blot assay. C Statistics of EdU-positive cells in GSCs. D Statistics
  of cell sphere formation efficiency of GSCs. E The proliferation of GSCs in response
  to oe-NC, oe-SNAI2, si-NC or SNAI2-KD as detected by EdU assay. F The sphere-forming
  ability of GSCs in response to oe-NC, oe-SNAI2, si-NC or SNAI2-KD as examined by
  spheroid formation assay. G the apoptosis of GSCs in response to oe-NC, oe-SNAI2,
  si-NC, or SNAI2-KD as examined by flow cytometry. *p < 0.05 vs. GSCs treated with
  oe-NC or si-NC. Each cell experiment was repeated three times independently.
