caption: Gene expression of GA metabolic pathway genes in D14L signalling mutants.
  GA and SL biosynthesis result from biosynthetic pathways that share initial steps
  but diverge after geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (left). The metabolic pathway
  for gibberellic acid (right). Genes that were upregulated in either smax1, d3 or
  smax1/d3 were selected and the normalised expression values across six genotypes
  are colour coded according to the z-score []. Genes with expression levels higher
  in either smax1, d3 or d3/smax1 mutants relative to their respective wild types
  (WTs) are indicated with upward arrows inside the box (fold change <1.5, FDR <0.05).
  Dongjin WT and Shiokari WT refer to cultivars in which smax1 and d3 arose, respectively.
  Solid and dotted lines represent synthesis and inactivation steps, respectively.
  MEP, 2-methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate; CPS, copalyl pyrophosphate synthase; ent-CDP,
