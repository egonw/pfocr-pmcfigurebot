caption: Tazobactam stimulates T-cell clones via an MHC-restricted and processing-dependent
  pathway. (A) T-cell clones were cocultured with drug and APC (+APC), glutaraldehyde-fixed
  APC (+Fix APC) or in the absence of APC (−APC) for 2 days before proliferation analysis
  by the addition of [3H]thymidine. (B) Proliferation assay to analyze tazobactam
  presentation to T-cell clones in the presence and absence of the MHC block. APC
  was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MHC class I and II blocking antibodies or
  isotype control before being cultured with drug and T-cell clones for 2 days. Proliferation
  was measured by the addition of [3H]thymidine. Results are expressed as counts per
  minute (cpm).
