caption: Schematic drawing of FGR2c/PKCε signaling network and its tumorigenic outcomes
  in PDAC cells. Only when highly expressed and in response to paracrine FGF2, FGFR2c
  triggers the activation of the FGFR2c/PKCε axis, which simultaneously controls,
  possibly converging on Extracellular Signaling-Regulated Kinase 1-2 (ERK1/2) pathway,
  EMT and repression of autophagy, as well as MCL-1-dependent cell survival and invasion.
