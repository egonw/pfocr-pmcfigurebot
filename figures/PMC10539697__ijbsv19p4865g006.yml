caption: TOF suppresses microglia polarization toward pro-inflammatory phenotype in
  vitro. (A) Representative immunofluorescent staining of iNOS (green) and Iba1 (red)
  in primary microglia in each group. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
  Scale bar, 20 μm. (B) Quantification of the iNOS fluorescence intensity. (The values
  are presented as mean ± SD; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, Student's t tests; data
  are combined from 3 independent experiments). (C) Western blot analysis and quantification
  of iNOS expression in primary microglia (The values are presented as mean ± SD;
  *p<0.05, **p<0.01, one-way ANOVA; data are combined from 3 independent experiments).
