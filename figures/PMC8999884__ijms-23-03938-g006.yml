caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) mediates epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway in human endometrial epithelial
  cells. (A) E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, SLUG, SNAIL, TWIST, and ZEB1 expression
  after DEHP treatment. LY2109761 restores the decreased E−cadherin expression as
  assessed using (B) flow cytometry and (C) quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
  (qRT-PCR). (D) qRT-PCR analysis showing alleviated N-cadherin, vimentin, SLUG, SNAIL,
  TWIST, ZEB1, and ZEB2 mRNA levels via TGF-β signaling pathway inhibition. All data
  are expressed as relative values against their respective control group. Data represent
  the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001
  (vs. DEHP treatment).'
