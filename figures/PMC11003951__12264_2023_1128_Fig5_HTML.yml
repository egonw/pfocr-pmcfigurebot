caption: 'IL1α screened from other inflammatory factors downregulates Grin2c and Ca2+signaling
  in astrocytes. A Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis
  reveals the relative grin2c mRNA level in astrocytes after 24 h stimulation with
  IL1α, C1q, and TNFα. Compared with the 20 ng/mL C1q group, the 20 ng/mL IL1α group
  shows more evident downregulation compared to the negative control group. And 20
  ng/mL TNFα up-regulates Grin2c mRNA levels in astrocytes. ****P <0.0001, **P <0.01,
  ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test (n = 3 biological replicates). B Western blots
  of Grin2c and CaMK2b after IL1α 20 ng/mL, C1q 20 ng/ml, and TNFα 20 ng/mL stimulation
  for 24 h; the trend of protein changes is consistent with that of mRNA. C, D Quantification
  of Grin2c and CaMK2b. ***P <0.001, **P <0.01, ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test
  (n = 3 biological replicates). E Transcriptome sequencing of astrocytes in the IL1α
  group (20 ng/mL IL1α, 24 h) compared with those of astrocytes in the NC group (inclusion
  criteria: abs (log2FC >1, P-value <0.05). There are 1998 differentially-expressed
  genes of astrocytes, among which 1001 are increased and 997 are decreased after
  IL1α stimulation. F Grin2c is significantly reduced in the IL1α group in counts
  data from high-throughput sequencing. ****P <0.0001, ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc
  test (n = 3 biological replicates). G Bar graph showing the top 10 GO functional
  enrichment analysis results of biological process (BP), cellular component (CC),
  and molecular function (MF) (inclusion criteria: P-value cut-off ≤0.05, q-value
  cut-off ≤0.05), in which ligand-gated ion channel activity and neurotransmitter
  receptor activity significantly change. H Bar graph showing the KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis results of the differentially-expressed genes of astrocytes after IL1α
  stimulation (inclusion criteria: P-value cut-off ≤0.05, q-value cut-off ≤0.05),
  in which the Ca2+signaling pathway significantly changes.'
