caption: 'Studying single-cell epigenome profile of stem cells using scEpiSearch.
  (A) Heatmap obtained from scEpiSearch showing biclustering of match scores of query
  scATAC-seq profiles of mouse embryonic cells (rows) with top matching reference
  single-cell epigenome profile (columns). The columns, highlighted with the pink
  bar below (and arrow), belong to reference cells from the late blastocyst, which
  show high similarity with the mESC of clusters-1. (B) The pie charts show cell types
  of the top five matching expression profiles to query scATAC-seq profiles of mESCs
  belonging to different clusters. It is based on a top-2000 enriched genes-based
  search. (C) The result of gene-set enrichment for selected biological functions
  using genes proximal to the top 10,000 peaks specific to mESC cells belongs to different
  clusters. The gene-set enrichment was performed using the GREAT Gene Ontology enrichment
  tool using default parameters. (D) The read counts at the promoter of genes belonging
  to the gene set for biological function terms: “intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
  in response to DNA damage” and “positive regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded
  protein response.” Here a matrix consisting of a read count for four clusters is
  quantile normalized to avoid bias. The star (*) shows a significant P-value (<0.03)
  calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. (E) The snapshot of the UCSC Genome Browser
  showing the difference in the activity level of the promoter of two genes (Rhbdd1,
  Dab2ip) associated with unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress
  and one gene (Fis1) associated with apoptosis, cell cycle, and mitochondrion fission.'
