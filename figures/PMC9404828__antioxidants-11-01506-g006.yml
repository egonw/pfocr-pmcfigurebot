caption: Implications of inhibition of JAK–STAT Pathway in full chronicity. Socs1
  is a negative regulator of the JAK–STAT pathway; therefore, its overexpression downregulates
  JAK–STAT, as is shown by the underexpression of STAT genes. As an additional level
  of downregulation, Il23a is also underexpressed in chronic wounds. The IL23 heterodimeric
  cytokine complex which forms when IL23a binds to IL23r activates STAT3. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it turns on gene expression
  associated with adaptive and innate immunity. This leads to the stimulation of type
  17 helper T (Th17) cells, which are crucial for host defense response against invading
  microbes and fungi. Downregulation of Il23a shows that JAK–STAT is downregulated,
  and therefore, stimulation of Th17 is downregulated as well, which could contribute
  to microbes persisting in chronic wounds leading to biofilm formation.
