caption: 'Melatonin protects Leydig cells from cisplatin-induced oxidative damage
  by activating the MT1/MT2-mediated SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) Determination
  of MT1 and MT2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig cells
  treated with Luzindole or Luzindole and melatonin. The blots were quantified using
  Image J software. (B) Determination of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels was performed
  by Western blotting in Leydig cells treated with Luzindole or Luzindole + melatonin.
  The blots were quantified using Image J software. (C) Determination of SIRT1, SOD1,
  and SOD2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in Leydig cells treated
  with Luzindole or Luzindole + melatonin. The blots were quantified using Image J
  software. (D) Determination of MT1 and MT2 protein levels was performed by Western
  blotting in control, CP, Luzindole + CP, and Luzindole + melatonin + CP groups.
  The blots were quantified using Image J software. (E) Determination of Nrf2, HO-1,
  and NQO1 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in control, CP, Luzindole
  + CP, and Luzindole + melatonin + CP groups. The blots were quantified using Image
  J software. (F) Determination of SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2 protein levels was performed
  by Western blotting in control, CP, Luzindole + CP, and Luzindole + melatonin +
  CP groups. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (G) Flow cytometry
  was used to detect apoptosis in control, CP, Luzindole + CP, and Luzindole + melatonin
  + CP groups. (H) Percentages of the apoptotic cells are shown. CP, cisplatin. Mel,
  melatonin. NS, no significance. Data are presented as the mean Â± SEM (N = 4 per
  group). * p < 0.05 compared with controls. # p < 0.05 compared with CP groups. NS
  compared with Luzindole groups or CP + Luzindole groups.'
