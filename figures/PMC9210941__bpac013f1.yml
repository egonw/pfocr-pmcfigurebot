caption: The complete workflow for the current investigation. Two types of samples
  (control cells, affected cells) were collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial
  cells and both are included in the GSE147507 dataset. The GSE52463 dataset contains
  IPF-affected lung samples. Common DEGs were identified from both the datasets using
  machine learning technique. From the common DEGs, GO identification, pathway analysis,
  PPIs network, TF–gene analysis, TF–miRNA analysis, and hub-gene identification were
  designed and based on those analysis drug molecule identification was performed.
