caption: The effects of silencing PDGFRβ on tumor inhibition of U251 cells. (a) U251
  cell viability was measured by CCK-8 after transfecting with si-NC or si-PDGFRβ
  at 0, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. (b) EdU detection showed that si-PDGFRβ induced apoptosis.
  (c) FACS analysis showed that si-PDGFRβ induced apoptosis. (d) Immunoblot analysis
  showed the levels of the proapoptotic protein of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and antiapoptotic
  protein of Bcl-2. (e) Wound healing test showed that si-PDGFRβ inhibited the migration
  of glioma cells. (f) Transwell assay results showed that downregulation of PDGFR
  revealed caspase-cell migration and invasion in glioma. (g) There are indications
  that si-PDGFRβ lowered MMP2 and MMP9, the hall marker protein of tumor invasion
  and metastasis by immunoblot analysis (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs.
  si-NC group).
