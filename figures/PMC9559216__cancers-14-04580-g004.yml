caption: Molecular classification of HCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  using a panel of 272 Wnt–Hippo pathway genes. (A) Heatmap showing normalized expression
  levels of 272 signature genes (rows) across subjects (columns) divided into four
  molecular subclasses (HCCW1–4), where blue and red indicate low and high expression,
  respectively. Significant differences in demographic characteristics, clinical annotations,
  molecular subclasses, and hepatitis B and C virus infection status across subjects
  are shown at the top of the figure. (B) Overall survival for subjects in each molecular
  subclass. (C) HCCW2 showed significantly better prognosis than HCCW4 based on two-sided
  log-rank tests. (D) HCCW3 showed significantly better prognosis than HCCW4 based
  on two-sided log-rank tests.
