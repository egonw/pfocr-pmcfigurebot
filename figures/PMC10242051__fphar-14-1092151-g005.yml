caption: 'Schizandrin C improves inflammation and inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) The mRNA level of IL-6 in LX-2 and HSC-T6 cells treated with Schizandrin C,
  n = 3. (B) The mRNA levels of the inflammatory factors in liver of the three groups,
  n = 5. (C) The images of NF-κB signaling-associated proteins detected by Western
  blotting. (D, E) Densitometric analysis for NF-κB signaling-associated protein levels,
  n = 3. (F) Representative results of immunofluorescence staining for p-NK-κB p65.
  Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 versus
  the control group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 versus model or TGF-β1
  groups.'
