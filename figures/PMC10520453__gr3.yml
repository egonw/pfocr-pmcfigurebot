caption: 'The two steady states of expression levels of Fus3(A) Trajectories of fluorescence
  intensity of Fus3 at 0.7 μM inside and outside the nucleus (only a portion shown).
  The red vertical line at 600 min was used to approximate the time node at which
  all cell fluorescence trajectories had entered a non-equilibrium steady state.(B)
  Three-dimensional distribution graph of Fus3 fluorescence intensity inside and outside
  the nucleus of yeast cells in the stationary phase under different pheromone concentrations.
  On the left is the 3D distribution of fluorescence or the 3D population landscape,
  in the middle is the 2D histograms or the 2D underlying potential landscapes U in
  exponential scale (defined as p ∼ e−U), which is also the population landscape;
  on the right is the 2D underlying potential landscapes U (). The sample sizes at
  steady state for each pheromone concentration are as follows: 0.7 μM was equivalent
  to 21,335 cells, 0.8 μM to 18,408 cells, 1.0 μM to 23,041 cells, 2.0 μM to 36,886
  cells, and 3.0 μM to 18,276 cells.(C) Diagram illustrating the molecular mechanism
  by which yeast cells respond to pheromone. The  represents the indirect pathway
  taken by Fus3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in order to inhibit the cell cycle;  represents
  the indirect pathway by which Fus3 in the nucleus promoted polar growth;  represents
  the direct pathway of Fus3 in the cytoplasm for polar growth;  represents the direct
  pathway for the transfer of Fus3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for polar growth;
  I1 and I2 represent the inhibitory effects of the negative feedback regulation;
  and the two gray dashed lines represent the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane.
  “α” stands for α-factor pheromone. The signaling cascade follows the following logic:
  Upon receiving sufficient external signals (α-factor), yeast cells activate Fus3,
  leading to a significant increase in phosphorylated Fus3 levels. Subsequently, activated
  Fus3 translocates into the cell nucleus (Outer_P1), initially engaging the branch
  involved in cell cycle inhibition, namely, Fus3 → Far1. Once the cell cycle is inhibited,
  activation of mating-specific proteins like Ste12 ensues. Within the nucleus, the
  activated Far1 not only contributes to cell-cycle arrest but also facilitates the
  activation of the first polarity growth pathway (Inner_P1) upon exiting the nucleus.
  As the nuclear Fus3 reaches a threshold level, excess Fus3 exits the nucleus and
  triggers Bni1 activation to facilitate polarized growth (Inner_P2). Concurrently,
  cytoplasmic Fus3 initiates the second polarity growth pathway (Outer_P2).(D) Schematic
  representation of two negative feedback models for regulating Fus3 gene expression.
  A and B represent, respectively, two different types of proteins that interact with
  Fus3 in the signaling pathway; “α” stands for α-factor pheromone.(E) Fluorescence
  intensity trajectories of Fus3 inside and outside the nucleus over time under non-equilibrium
  steady state. The red line represents the fitting by the hidden Markov model to
  distinguish high- and low-expression states. Arrows indicate spontaneous state switching
  events between the high state (HI/HO) and low state (LI/LO). The x axis is shared
  between the two panels to optimize figure clarity. The high and low states were
  distinguished by hidden Markov modeling of the fluorescence trajectories, with iterative
  optimization of model parameters to ensure global convergence. The expression fate
  at each time point was determined by the relative probability and transition dynamics
  between the two expression states.'
