caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of KEGG, Reactome and GO database was
  performed on the DEGs. Pathway overlapping was visualized in Venn diagrams (A) where
  pathways that were common to all three disease models and pathways unique to HDM-CS
  model were denoted. Dot plots showed the top GO terms that were common to all three
  disease models (B), as well as GO, KEGG and Reactome terms derived from the DEGs
  exclusively found in HDM-CS treated mice (C). For each biological group, n = 5
