caption: 'Comparison of histological changes in the lung after IH exposure. (A) Representative
  pictures of hematoxylin and eosin staining (100×) and (B) PAS staining (100×) (C)
  Masson’s trichrome staining (100×) of lung sections from mice after the final administration
  of Dp. Scale bars, 50 μm. Sections are representative of seven mice. CTL: control,
  saline challenge under normoxia conditions, CTL+IH: IH exposure without Dp administration
  Dp: Dp administration for allergic asthma induction under normoxia conditions; Dp+IH:
  Dp administration for allergic asthma induction and IH exposure.'
