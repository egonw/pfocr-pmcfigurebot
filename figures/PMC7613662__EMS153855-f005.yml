figure_title: Mucosal antibody regulation of microbiome circadian rhythmicity modulates
  nutrient and metabolite availability and uptake
caption: A) JTK analysis of GO Term pathway scores identified by shotgun metagenomics
  of serially sampled feces of Ctrl and IgMi mice over five 6 hour intervals over
  a circadian day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18, 0), n=5 per group per timepoint, and representative
  of a single experiment. Significance cutoff = p<0.05. B) Z-score heatmap of average
  GO Term scores identified to be significantly oscillatory in Ctrl mice and perturbed
  in IgMi mice by JTK cycle analysis (p<0.05), and C) select exemplar pathways double
  plotted. D) Glucose levels in serially sampled feces of Ctrl and IgMi mice over
  five 6 hour intervals over a circadian day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18, 0), n=5 per group per
  timepoint, and representative of a single experiment. E) Glucose levels in serially
  sampled blood of Ctrl and IgMi mice over five 6 hour intervals over a circadian
  day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18; ZT0 double plotted), n=8-12 per group per timepoint, representative
  of data pooled from three independent experiments. P values determined via JTK Cycle.
  All data shown as +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, ***
  p< 0.001, **** p< 0.0001.
