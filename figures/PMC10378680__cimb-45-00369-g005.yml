caption: Schematic diagram of the role of Piezo1 in immune cells. (1) Activation of
  piezo1 upon stimulation by hydrostatic pressure leads to Ca2+ influx. In turn, the
  increase in Ca2+ activates the AP1/HIF1ɑ signaling pathway, inducing macrophage
  differentiation into M1-like macrophages that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  (2) Mechanical stiffness or inflammatory signals activate piezo1 on DCs, leading
  to Ca2+ influx and secretion of polarizing factors IL-12 and TGF-β and ultimately
  affecting the mutual differentiation of Th1 and Treg cells. (3) Activation of piezo1
  on T cells affects their differentiation into CD4+/CD8+ T cells and Th17/Treg cell
  reciprocally (created with https://www.figdraw.com/static/index.html accessed on
