caption: Essential metabolites are assigned higher priority scores using metabolomics
  profiling with DOX treatment. (a) Expression of acetate, glucose, glutamate, glutamine,
  sn-glycero-3-PCho, valine, methionine, and isoleucine were increased metabolites
  in HCT116 cancer cells. (b) Expression of alanine, choline, fumarate, taurine, o-phosphocholine,
  inosine, lysine, and phenylalanine were decreased their regulation in HCT116 cancer
  cells. The black dot represents the control; the blue dot represents 0.75 µg/mL
  of DOX; the green dot represents 1.5 µg/mL of DOX; and the red dot represents 7.5
  µg/mL of DOX. *, ** and *** represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.
