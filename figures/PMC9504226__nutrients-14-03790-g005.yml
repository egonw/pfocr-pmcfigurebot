caption: 'WA suppresses the activation of NF-κB signal pathway. Representative photomicrographs
  of IHC analysis for ECM1 (A) and p65 (B). Scale bars: 50 µm. (C) Changes of phospho-IκBα
  (p-IκBα) and phospho-IKKα/β (p-IKKα/β) in A2780cis cells administrated with WA,
  CDDP or combination in vitro and in vivo. Actin is shown as protein-loading control.
  (D) A schematic diagram shows that wentilactone A inhibits the activation of IKK/IκB
  to reverse cisplatin resistance induced by the NF-κB/ECM1/Microenvironment axis.'

  Resistance through Inhibition of IKK/IκB in Ovarian Cancer Cells.
