caption: OEA regulated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through activation of TRPV1.
  (A–D) WB results showed the expression levels of TRPV1, P85, and p-AKT in H9C2 cells
  induced by high glucose and OGD/R and treated with OEA or CPZ. (E) Analysis of cells
  in each group was performed by flow cytometry. Horizontal axis represents Annexin
  V fluorescence intensity. Vertical axis represents PI fluorescence intensity, and
  Q2 region represents the number of apoptotic cells. (F) Statistical analysis of
  apoptotic cells was performed by flow cytometry (n = 3). Data were expressed as
  mean ± SEM, ♦♦p < 0.01, ♦♦♦p < 0.001 vs. HG + OGD/R group; and &&p < 0.01, &&&p
  < 0.001 vs. HG + OGD/R + CPZ group.
