caption: 'Effect of quercetin on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in RIMVECs. (a) p65, p-p65, pro-IL-18,
  IL-18, pro-IL-1β, and IL-1β protein expression (n = 3) in RIMVEC incubated with
  LPS+ATP in the presence or absence of quercetin as measured by western blot. Results
  are expressed as mean ± SEM. ##P < 0.01 versus control group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001 versus LPS+ATP group. (b) IL-1β and IL-18 mRNA expression in RIMVECs
  incubated with LPS+ATP in the presence or absence of quercetin, as measured by RT-qPCR.
  Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. ##P < 0.01 versus control group, ***P < 0.001
  versus LPS+ATP group (n = 3). (c) IL-1β and IL-18 protein levels in the medium of
  RIMVEC incubated with LPS+ATP in the presence or absence of quercetin, as measured
  by ELISA (n = 3). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. ##P < 0.01 versus control
  group, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 versus LPS+ATP group.'
