caption: AP3S1 regulates EMT in ovarian cancer through the TGF-β pathway. A Significant
  inhibition of TGF-β and EMT pathways in ovarian cancer cells after AP3S1 knockdown.
  B The TGF-β pathway activator SRI-011381 rescues the decreased expression of TGF-β
  pathway and EMT-related proteins caused by AP3S1 knockdown. C Pirfenidone further
  exacerbates the decreased expression of TGF-β pathway and EMT-related proteins caused
  by AP3S1 knockdown. All data are mean ± SD. Significance calculated using the unpaired
  t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Representative data
  are from three independent experiments
