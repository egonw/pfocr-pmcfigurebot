caption: CAPE upregulates the activities of the AMPKα1/2 signaling pathway in bladder
  carcinoma cells. (A) HT1376 cells were treated with various concentrations of CAPE
  for 24 h, and the protein levels of the AMPKα1/2 and p-AMPKα1/2 were determined
  using immunoblot assays. (B) The expression of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 was determined
  by RT-qPCR in HT_shCOL and HT_shAMPKα1/2 cells (n = 3). (C) The expression of AMPKα1/2
  and β-actin was determined by immunoblotting in HT_shCOL and HT_shAMPKα1/2 cells.
  The protein level of AMPKα1/2 and β-actin was determined by immunoblot assays (D)
  and the mRNA level of GDF15 was determined by RT-qPCR assays (E; n = 3) in HT_shCOL
  and HT_shAMPKα1/2 cells after (+) or without (−) 30 μM CAPE treatment. (F) The proliferation
  of HT_shCOL and HT_shAMPKα1/2 cells was determined by the EdU assays after (+) or
  without (−) 30 μM CAPE treatment for 24 h (n = 4). ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗P < 0.05.
