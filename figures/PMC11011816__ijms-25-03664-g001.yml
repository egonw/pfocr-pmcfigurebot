caption: Functional annotation of DEGs in the differentiation process of skeletal
  muscle satellite cells by using GSEA. (A) Gene ontology analysis. (B) KEGG pathway
  analysis. (C) The top suppressed gene set in D36h was ranked by NES. Heatmap plots
  (D) and volcano plots (the dotted line in (E) indicates |log2FoldChange| = 2) (E)
  of 26 core enrichment genes in the cell cycle pathway. (F) Validation via RT-qPCR
  of several DE mRNAs from RNA-seq. (* p < 0.05). ns is considered to be not significant.
