caption: Correlation analysis. (A) Pairwise Spearman correlation matrix analysis between
  all genes of interest using the GSE152075 dataset. The upper half displays the Spearman
  coefficients (r) considering all patients (Corr.; black), non-COVID-19 patients
  (Neg.; pink), or COVID-19 patients (Pos.; purple). Black boxes highlight pairs of
  genes that have significant correlation only in COVID-19-positive patients, except
  for JAK2/STAT1, which was the pair with the highest coefficient in COVID-19-positive
  patients. The lower half displays the scatterplots. (B) Dot plot representing pairwise
  Spearman correlation for JAK2 and STAT1, considering viral load in COVID-19-positive
  patients from the GSE152075 dataset. Viral load is represented as a color scale
  and was categorized as Negative (pink), Low (first quartile; light blue), Intermediate
  (second and third quartile; purple), or High (fourth quartile; blue), and was considered
  as an independent variable expressed as cycle threshold (Ct) by RT-qPCR for the
  N1 viral gene at time of diagnosis. The interpretation for viral load is the lower
  the Ct, the higher the viral load. (C) Box plot representing the combined expression
  of JAK2 + STAT1 and their association with the viral load. Viral load was categorized
  as Negative (pink), Low (first quartile; light blue), Intermediate (second and third
  quartile; purple), or High (fourth quartile; blue). p-values correspond to Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test. Statistical significance * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
