caption: PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 induces Bcr/Abl degradation, activates p53 and affects the
  Bcr/Abl and p53 pathways in KU‐812 cells. A) Representative western blotting of
  Bcr/Abl (p210) after treatment with PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 at different concentrations and
  statistical analysis of data from three independent assays (n = 3; * indicates p < 0.05,
  **** indicates p < 0.0001). B) Representative western blotting analysis of p53,
  PUMA, and NOXA in KU‐812 cells after 24 h of treatment with Bcr/Abl‐R6 (10 × 10−6m
  ), PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 (10 × 10−6m ), or imatinib (1 × 10−6m) and the statistical analysis
  of data from three independent experiments (n = 3). C) Volcano plots of proteomics
  analysis in KU‐812 cells after treatment with PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 at a concentration of
  10 × 10−6m for 24 h. D) Heatmap analysis of proteomics analysis in KU‐812 cells
  after treatment with PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 (10 × 10−6m ) for 24 h compared to vehicle treated
  control group. E) GO pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated proteins after
  PMIBcr/Abl‐R6 treatment compared to control group in KU‐812 cells. F) Protein–protein
  interactions related to Bcr/Abl analysis in KU‐812 cells after treatment with PMIBcr/Abl‐R6.
