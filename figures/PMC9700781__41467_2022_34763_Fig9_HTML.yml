figure_title: Defective Hh signaling perturbs the development of the conducting airways
  without affecting saccule formation
caption: a, b, c Heatmap of gene expression from control (ShhCre/+), Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+,
  Tfamf/f; ShhCre/+ and Cox10f/f; ShhCre/+ lungs at 14.5 days post coitus (dpc). 641
  genes that showed similar differential gene expression in all three datasets were
  plotted. The relative positions of Hh pathway components, Shh, Ptch1 and Hhip, and
  Fgf10 on the gene list were indicated on the heatmap. d, e Whole-lung imaging of
  dissected lungs from ShhCre/+; ROSA26mTmG/+ (control) and ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+
  (Shh−/−) mice at 14.5 and 15.5 dpc. GFP was activated from the ROSA26mTmG allele
  in all lung epithelial cells by ShhCre; tdTomato marked all non-epithelial cells.
  Many GFP+ buds were present on the cystic surface of ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+ (Shh−/−)
  lungs. Scale bar = 1 mm. f Immunostaining of lung sections collected from ShhCre/+;
  ROSA26mTmG/+ (control) and ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+ (Shh−/−) lungs at 18.5 dpc.
  NKX2.1 labeled all epithelial cells, while p63 marked the basal cells in trachea
  and main stem bronchi. The cystic wall in ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+ (Shh−/−) lungs
  contained cells that expressed markers of trachea/main stem bronchi. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  g Immunostaining of lung sections collected from ShhCre/+; ROSA26mTmG/+ (control)
  and ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+ (Shh−/−) lungs at 18.5 dpc. SPC labeled alveolar epithelial
  type II (AT2) cells, while HOPX marked alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) cells. Saccule-like
  structures were found on the cystic surface of ShhCre/Cre; ROSA26mTmG/+ (Shh−/−)
  lungs and contained AT1 and AT2 cells. Scale bar = 100 μm.
