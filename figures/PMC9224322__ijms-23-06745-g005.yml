caption: 'Prss8PaxLC1 Ko mice exhibited a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration
  and an increase in plasma renin activity under low Na+ diet. (A) Plasma aldosterone
  levels in control (black square) and knockout mice (Ko, white square) under standard,
  high and low Na+ diet. (B) Natriuretic response expressed as fractional excretion
  of Na+ (in %) in control (black square) and knockout mice (Ko, white square) treated
  with vehicle or acute treatment of benzamil (0.2mg/kgBW). (C) Measurement of basal
  plasma angiotensin I concentration (determined at 4 °C) and (D), plasma renin activity
  (PRA) expressed as amount of angiotensin I following enzymatic cleavage of the renin
  substrate angiotensinogen (at 37 °C) in Prss8PaxLC1 control (black square) and knockout
  mice (Ko, white square). (A,C,D) were analyzed by an unpaired two-tailed t test.
  (B) was analyzed by a two-way ANOVA with a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test (column
  factor: genotype; row factor: treatment). (A) Results are represented as mean ±
  SEM (2 series of experiment, control n = 5–11, Ko n = 6–11). (B–D) Results are represented
  as mean ± SD. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. * p < 0.05.'
