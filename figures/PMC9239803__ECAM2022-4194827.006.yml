caption: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  of the Dahuang-Huangqi decoction (DHHQD) and renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) target-pathway
  network. KEGG is based on (a) gene ratio and (b) pvalue. (c) The top 20 putative
  signaling pathways, containing 151 nodes and 7,734 edges. The 131 green nodes represent
  targets, and the 20 red nodes represent the top 20 KEGG pathways. The edges represent
  the interactions and node size is proportional to interaction degree.
