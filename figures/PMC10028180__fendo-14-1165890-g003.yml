caption: Cell communication analysis of PHPT patient samples. (A) String plot of the
  aggregated cell-cell communication network, showing the number of interactions between
  cell types. (B) Comparison of the number of interactions between male and female
  patients.ns=not statistically significant (unpaired t-test). (C) Comparison of the
  interaction strength between male and female patients. ,ns=not statistically significant
  (unpaired t-test). (D) Differential interaction strength comparison between male
  and female patients. (E) Heatmap of interaction numbers and strength in different
  cell types. (F) Pathway enrichment analysis of genes differentially expressed in
  two sexes. (G) FGF signaling pathway network of all cell types. (H) Enriched receptor-ligand
  pairs between parathyroid cells and other cell types in the FGF pathway.
