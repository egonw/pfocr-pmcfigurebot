caption: Downstream effectors of CASC10 in HGSOC cells. Transcriptome−wise analysis
  by RNA sequencing (RNA−seq) following siRNA−mediated CASC10 knockdown in OVCAR3CIS
  cells. (A) Genomic information of CASC10 (flanking sequences), chromosomal location,
  and RNA structure using the NCBI and ENSEMBL databases. (B) CASC10 subcellular localization
  plots displayed by lncATLAS. Bars representing CN-RCI values for CASC10 across all
  cell lines. Expression values (FPKMs) for CASC10 are shown for both compartments
  (cytoplasm on top of the bar and nucleus on the bottom). Bars are colored by their
  absolute nuclear expression. (C) Venn diagram showing that 1400 differentially abundant
  RNA transcripts in NC−siRNA vs. CASC10−siRNA(2) in OVCAR3CIS cells. (D,E) Gene ontology
  and KEGG analysis of functional enrichment via Metascape. The 20 top most significant
  (p-value ≤ 0.01) enriched ontology clusters (D) and the top 20 most enriched ontology
  clusters regulated by transcription factors (E). (F) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) following siRNA−mediated CASC10 knockdown. The top network is shown and involved
  in cell cycle regulation, programmed cell death, and survival-related genes.
