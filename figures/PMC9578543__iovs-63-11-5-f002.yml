caption: The mean values of refraction (A) and axial length (B) in the left and right
  eyes of guinea pigs at 0, 2, and 4 weeks were compared between the LIM and NC groups
  (mean Â± SD). LIM represents the negative lens-induced group, and NC represents the
  normal control group. At 0, 2, and 4 weeks, the LIM group was compared with the
  NC group (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
