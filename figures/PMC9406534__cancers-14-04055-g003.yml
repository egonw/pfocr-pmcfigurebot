caption: TRAF2 in RIG1 signaling. Binding of dsRNA by RIG1, results in conformational
  change, K63-ubiquitination, and filament formation. RIG1 filaments in turn instruct
  filament formation of mitochondria-associated MAVS. The MAVS filaments enable recruitment
  of TRAF2 and IRF3, but also other TRAF proteins not indicated here. TRAF2 and the
  other TRAF proteins mediate the recruitment of the IKK complex and TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1)/IKKε enabling activation of the classical NFκB pathway and IRF3
  by the mechanisms described in detail in the text. Please note, TRAF2 acts independently
  here from cIAP1 and cIAP2 []. For more details refer to main text.
