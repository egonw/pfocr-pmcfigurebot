caption: 'DEK promotes autophagy and inhibits apoptosis in GC through AMPK/mTOR signaling
  pathway. si-DEK/si-NC was transfected into HGC27/SGC7901 cell line, similarly OE-DEK/OE-NC
  was transfected into HGC27/SGC7901 cell line. The cells were harvested 36 h after
  transfection. (A) The protein expression levels of DEK, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR and p-mTOR
  were detected by Weather Blot. (B) Quantitative analysis of Weather Blot results
  for DEK, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR, and p-mTOR proteins after si-NC/si-DEK in HGC27 cells,
  normalized with Actin protein signal. (C) Quantitative analysis of Weather Blot
  results for DEK, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR, and p-mTOR proteins after si-NC/si-DEK in SGC7901
  cells, normalized with Actin protein signal. (D) Quantitative analysis of Weather
  Blot results for DEK, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR and p-mTOR proteins after HGC27 cells were
  subjected to OE-NC/OE-DEK, normalized with Actin protein signal. (E) Quantitative
  analysis of Weather Blot results for DEK, AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR and p-mTOR proteins
  after OE-NC/OE-DEK in SGC7901 cells, normalized with Actin protein signal (n = 3,
  *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001).'
