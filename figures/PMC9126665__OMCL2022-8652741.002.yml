caption: 'NBP promoted BDNF/TrkB signaling and reduced cell death caused by RCIR injury.
  (a)–(c) Western blot analysis of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus 4 weeks after
  RCIR. n = 6 in each group. (d) Representative micrographs for TUNEL staining in
  CA1 subfields of the hippocampus 4 weeks after RCIR. 400× magnification was shown.
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (e) The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of TUNEL
  (+) cells divided by the total number of cells. n = 4 in each group. (f)–(h) Western
  blot analysis demonstrated Bax and Bcl-2 expression at 4 weeks after RCIR injury.
  n = 6 in each group. β-Actin was used as an internal control. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, the
  RCIR group vs. the sham group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, the NBP80 group
  or NBP120 group vs. the RCIR group; $P < 0.05, the NBP80 group vs. the NBP120 group.
  Values are expressed as the mean ± SD.'
