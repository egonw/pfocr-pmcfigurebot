caption: RNA-sequencing analysis of wild type and TCF1 and LEF1 knockdown MOLT4 cells.
  (A) Heatmap of different numbers of regulated genes in TCF1 and LEF1 knockdown cells
  compared with those in wildtype cells. (B) Specific genes regulated by TCF1 and
  LEF1, including downregulated genes, upregulated genes, and unchanged genes. (C)
  The signaling pathways with the most regulated genes in TCF1 and LEF1 knockdown
  cells. (D) The common genes regulated in TCF1 and LEF1 knockdown cells. (E) The
  common genes regulated by TCF1 and LEF1 in two signaling pathways, inflammation
  mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway and cadherin signaling pathway.
article_title: TCF1/LEF1 triggers Wnt-dependent chemokine/cytokine-induced inflammation
  and cadherin pathways to drive T-ALL cell migration.
