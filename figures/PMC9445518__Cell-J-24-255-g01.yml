caption: 'Effects of cordycepin on the biological behaviors of colon cancer cells.
  A. The molecular structure of cordycepin. B. Cell viability of HT-29 and LoVo cells
  was detected by MTT assay after treatment with different concentrations of cordycepin
  (control, 20 µM, 40 µM and 80 µM). C. Cell migration (scale bars: 50 μm) of HT-29
  and LoVo cells was detected by scratch healing assay after treatment with different
  concentrations of cordycepin (control, 20 µM, 40 µM and 80 µM). D. Cell invasion
  (scale bars: 50 μm) of HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by Transwell assay after
  treatment with different concentrations of cordycepin (control, 20 µM, 40 µM and
  80 µM). E. Cell apoptosis of HT-29 and LoVo cells was detected by flow cytometry
  after treatment with different concentrations of cordycepin (control, 20 µM, 40
  µM and 80 µM). All experiments were repeated at least 3 times and were performed
  in triplicates, and data were presented as mean ± SD. *; P<0.05, **; P<0.01, and
  ***; P<0.001.'
