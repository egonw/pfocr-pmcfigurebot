caption: ANTXR1 silencing promotes erythroid cell differentiation in HUDEP-2 cells
  by interval consecutive analysis. (a) Analysis of GATA1 and ALAS2 protein expressions
  in HUDEP-2 cells following the knockdown of ANTXR1 the gene expression levels by
  western blotting and qRT-PCR. (b, c) The relative protein expression levels of GATA1
  and ALAS2 were detected after HUDEP-2 cells were transfected with ANTXR1-sh5. (d,
  e) Quantification of western blots. Error bars represent standard deviation of three
  independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
