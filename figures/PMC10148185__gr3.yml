caption: 'Hypoxia-pretreated CGMs alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory response
  and promote NRF2/HO-1 pathway activation in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. (A) The
  level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in each group was detected after co-incubation for
  48 ​h (n ​= ​3). (B) The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different groups
  were analyzed after co-incubation for 48 ​h (n ​= ​3). (C) Superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) activity levels were evaluated after different treatments after co-incubation
  for 48 ​h (n ​= ​3). (D) The concentrations of TNFα, IL6, and MMP13 were evaluated
  after co-incubation for 48 ​h by ELISA assay (n ​= ​3). (E–H) The mRNA expressions
  of the inflammatory factors (Tnfα, Il6, iNOS, and Cox2) in each group were detected
  after co-incubation for 48 ​h by PCR analysis (n ​= ​3). (I and J) The mRNA expressions
  of the antioxidant genes (Sod1 and Sod2) were detected after co-incubation for 48 ​h
  by PCR analysis (n ​= ​3). (K) The mRNA expressions of the NRF2/HO-1 pathway-related
  genes (Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1) were detected after co-incubation for 48 ​h
  by PCR analysis (n ​= ​3). (L) The protein expressions of the NRF2/HO-1 pathway-related
  markers (KEAP1, NRF2, and HO-1) were assessed after co-incubation for 48 ​h by western
  blotting analysis. Data represent mean ​± ​S.D. ∗P ​< ​0.05, ∗∗P ​< ​0.01, ∗∗∗P ​< ​0.001
  versus the Control group. #P ​< ​0.05, ##P ​< ​0.01, ###P ​< ​0.001 versus the IL-1β
  group. $P ​< ​0.05, $$P ​< ​0.01, $$$P ​< ​0.001 versus the norm-CGMs group.'
