caption: 'The relative expression analysis of CtCYP81E8 and core structural genes
  of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in transgenic Arabidopsis. (a) The Phenotype of
  wild-type, OE-13, and OE-15 transgenic lines. (b) The expression level of CtCYP81E8
  in different transgenic lines (OE1-15). (c) The expression level of key structural
  genes involved in the downstream regulatory pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis. Gene
  encoding these enzymes includes: Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), CHS (Chalcone synthase),
  DFR (Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), ANS (Anthocyanidin synthase), F3′H (flavonoid
  3′-hydroxylase), FLS (Flavonol synthase), F3H (Flavonoid 3-hydroxylase), CHI (Chalcone
  isomerase) LAR, (Leucoanthocyanidin reductase). The relative fold expression level
  was normalized according to the 18S rRNA gene. Data were presented as means ± SE
  (n = 3), and the asterisks * denotes p < 0.05, ** denotes p < 0.01, and *** denotes
  p < 0.001.'
