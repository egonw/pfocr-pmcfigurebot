caption: 'Genetic perturbation of the ERK pathway results in changes to ERK-KTR localisation.
  (A–H) Wing disc clones expressing ERK-KTR, shown in the plane of the epithelium
  (A,C,E,G) or in cross-section (B,D,F,H). ERK-KTR is shown in cyan (B,D,F,H) and
  single channels are seen in A,C,E,G and B′,D′,F′,H′. Dlg is shown in magenta and
  DAPI in yellow (single channel B″,D″,F″,H″). In control clones (A,B), ERK-KTR localisation
  varied among cells within the clone with some cells displaying nuclear localisation,
  and others predominantly cytoplasmic localisation. (C,D) Clones expressing a constitutive-active
  form of Ras, RasV12, in which ERK signalling was hyperactivated, showed nuclear
  exclusion of ERK-KTR. (E,F) Expression of a dominant-negative form of Egfr (DN-Egfr)
  resulted in increased nuclear localisation of ERK-KTR. (G,H) Overexpression of Hopscotch
  (Hop), a kinase that is not in the ERK signalling pathway, did not alter ERK-KTR
  localisation compared to control. (I) Quantification of the ERK-KTR C/N ratio in
  clones of the indicated genotype. Subcellular localisation was significantly affected
  by RasV12 expression (P<0.0032, one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Šidák''s multiple
  comparisons test, N=42 cells from six discs for control, N=38 cells from six discs
  for RasV12) and DN-Egfr expression (P<0.0124, N=46 cells from five discs), but not
  Hop overexpression (P<0.9984, N=43 cells from four discs). (J) Quantification of
  the ERK-KTR C/N ratio in the somatic cyst lineage of adult testes. ERK-KTR was expressed
  in cyst stem cells and early cyst cells using the C587-Gal4 driver either alone
  (control) or together with RasV12 or DN-Egfr. Compared to control, RasV12 expression
  significantly increased the ERK-KTR C/N ratio (P=0.0001, one-way ANOVA followed
  by Holm-Šidák''s multiple comparisons test, N=102 cells from 20 testes for control,
  N=38 cells from five testes for RasV12), while DN-Egfr significantly decreased it
  (P<0.0001, N=15 cells from four testes). Bars show mean and 95% confidence interval.
