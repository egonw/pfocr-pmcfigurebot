caption: A visual schematic and the timing diagrams for the 13C- direct -detect experiments
  used to detect acetyllysine. (A) A schematic of the magnetization transfer pathway
  is shown on acetyllysine. The carbon-start [13Cʹ,15N]–CON-Kac is shown in black
  arrows. The initial INEPT transfer step between amide proton and carbon in the amide
  proton-start [13Cʹ,15N]–CON-Kac is displayed as a red arrow. (B) Pulse sequence
  for the carbon-start [13Cʹ,15N]–CON-Kac experiment. The delay times are Δ = 9.8
  ms, Δ1 = 25 ms, and ε = t1(0) + pC180. The phase cycle is φ1 = x,−x;φ2 = x,x,−x,−x;
  φ3 = 4(x),4(−x); φREC = x,− x, x, −x, −x, x, −x, x. 15N chemical shift evolution
  is measured during t1, with quadrature achieved by States-TPPI incrementation of
  φ3. (C) Pulse sequence for the amide proton-start [13Cʹ,15N]–CON-Kac experiment.
  The delay times are δ = 4.6 ms, δ1 = 5.1 ms, Δ = 24.8 ms, Δ1 = 9.0 ms. The phase
  cycle is φ1 = x,−x; φ2 = x,x,−x,−x; φ3 = −y; φ4 = 4(x),4(−x); φREC = x,− x, −x,
  x, −x, x, x, −x. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimension is obtained by States-TPPI
  incrementation of φ2. For both pulse sequences, narrow and wide rectangular pulses
  correspond to 90° and 180° hard pulses, respectively. All 13C pulses are represented
  with narrow (90°, Q5_sebop) shapes and wide (180°, Q3_surbop) shapes. The gray pulse
  on 13C indicates a band-selective 13Cʹ and 13Cali inversion pulse. The ‘TR’ label
  indicates a time-reversed 90° pulse. All pulses are applied with x-phase unless
  otherwise indicated. Pulsed field gradients (Gz) are also represented by shapes.
  Nitrogen decoupling is achieved with garp4 (240 μs, 2.81 W), and proton decoupling
  is achieved using waltz65 (80 μs, 0.209 W). In the 1D variants, t1 is held constant
  at the time of the first increment (3 μs) and is not collected as a variable delay.
