caption: MiR-552 promoted the HGSOC progression via ATG10-EMT pathway. (a) miR-552
  expression was significantly higher in HGSOC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues.
  (b) The expression of miR-552 was detected in OVCAR3, OVCAR4, SNU119, CAOV4, CAOV3,
  and FTSEC cell lines by qRT-PCR. (c) CCK-8 assays showed that miR-552 promoted HGSOC
  cells proliferation ability. (d) Transwell assays showed that miR-552 elevated HGSOC
  cells migration capacity. (e) A schematic outline of sequence sites of miR-552 targeted
  to ATG10 predicted by bioinformatic analysis. (f) The expression of ATG10 was detected
  in miR-552 knockdown cells by qRT-PCR. (g) Dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried
  out to examine the luciferase activity of ATG10-wt group and ATG10-mut group. (h)
  The relationship between mRNA expressions of ATG10 and miR-552 in 23 pairs of HGSOC
  tissues was detected. (i) and (j) mRNA and protein levels of EMT markers were detected
  in miR-552 mimic, miR-552 inhibitor, siATG10 group, and miR-552 inhibitor plus siATG10
  group by qRT-PCR. Data are reported as means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P <
  0.001.
