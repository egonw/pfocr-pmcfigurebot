caption: 'miR‐130a‐3p leads to enhanced Akt/PI3K Signalling pathway. To study the
  effect of miR‐130a‐3p‐Acsl4 on Akt/PI3K Signalling pathway in NSCs, they were transfected
  with Acsl4 siRNA and overexpression plasmid, or miR‐130a‐3p/NC mimics and miR‐130a‐3p/NC
  inhibitor for 7d. NC: blank control group. GSK690693: inhibitors of AKT kinases.
  GSK690693+miR‐130a‐3p‐in: inhibitors of AKT kinases+miR‐130a‐3p inhibitor–treated
  group. GSK690693+Acsl4: inhibitors of AKT kinases+Acsl4 overexpression plasmid‐treated
  group. Wortmanin: inhibitors of PI3K kinases. Wortmanin+miR‐130a‐3p‐in: inhibitors
  of PI3K kinases+miR‐130a‐3p inhibitor–treated group. Wortmanin+Acsl4: inhibitors
  of PI3K kinases+Acsl4 overexpression plasmid‐treated group. (A) Western blot was
  performed to detect p‐Akt and PI3K. NC: blank control group. miR‐130a‐3p: miR‐130a‐3p
  mimic–treated group. si‐Acsl4: Acsl4 siRNA group. si‐Acsl4+miR‐130a‐3p‐in: Acsl4 siRNA
  +miR‐130a‐3p inhibitor–treated group. Acsl4: Acsl4 overexpression plasmid‐treated
  group. Acsl4+miR‐130a‐3p: Acsl4 overexpression plasmid+miR‐130a‐3p mimic‐treated
  group. After total protein extraction, Akt, p‐Akt, and PI3K level expression were
  analysed using Western blot with β‐actin as endogenous control. (B) Western blot
  was performed to detect p‐Akt/Akt and PI3K expression. The results are described
  as the mean ± SEM at least three separate experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001 vs. indicated group. (one‐way analysis of variance followed by Tukey''s
  post hoc test)'
