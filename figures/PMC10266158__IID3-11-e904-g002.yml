caption: 'Effects of EPI on histopathology and functions of kidney in adriamycin‐induced
  nephropathy rats. CON: control. (A) Kidney tissue stained with H&E (×200 and ×400).
  Red arrows—severe infiltration of inflammatory cells, black arrows—thickening of
  the glomerular basement membrane, and green arrows—vacuolar degeneration of tubular
  epithelial cells. (B) Effects of EPI on serum levels of Cr, BUN, and KIM‐1 in rats
  with nephropathy. (C) Effects of EPI on urine levels of Cr, BUN, MAU, and UP in
  adriamycin‐induced nephropathy rats. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD), n = 3 or 8 rats per group, *p < .05, **p < .01 compared with the ADR group.
  ADR, adriamycin‐induced nephropathy; EPI‐H, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim high dose
  group; EPI‐L, Epimedium sagittatum Maxim low dose; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; PA,
  prednisone.'

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
