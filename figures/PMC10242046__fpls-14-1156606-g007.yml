caption: Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway showing co-expressed genes, proteins and
  metabolites in drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) chickpea genotypes
  under control (C) and drought (D) conditions. Co-expressed genes, proteins and metabolites
  are shown by orange, green and blue colored boxes, respectively. Up- (*) and down-regulated
  (**) genes, proteins and metabolites are marked.
