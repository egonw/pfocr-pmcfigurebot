caption: PTEN upregulates KLF4 expression in NSCLC cells. (a) The expression levels
  of PTEN in A549 cells transfected with KLF4-siR/overexpression were detected by
  immunoblotting assay. (b) The expression levels of KLF4 in A549 cells transfected
  with PTEN-siR/overexpression were detected by immunoblotting assay. (c) The expression
  levels of PTEN in PC9 cells transfected with KLF4-siR/overexpression were detected
  by immunoblotting assay. (d) The expression levels of KLF4 in PC9 cells transfected
  with PTEN-siR/overexpression were detected by immunoblotting assay. Î²-Actin was
  used as an internal control. All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate.
