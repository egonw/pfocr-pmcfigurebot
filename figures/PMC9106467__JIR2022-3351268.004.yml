caption: Ech restrained the malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells by inhibiting Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway activation. (a) The expression of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  proteins, c-Myc, and c-Fos in A549 cells was detected by western blotting. (b) The
  phosphorylation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, c-Myc, and c-Fos was measured by western
  blotting in A549 cells treated by Ech with or without LM22B-10. (c) EdU staining
  of A549 cells and EdU-positive cell proportion. (d, e) Levels of IL-1β and IL-18
  in cell culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA. (f, g) Ech decreased GSH and
  increased MDA. Bar = 50 μm. Data were represented as mean ± SD and represent three
  replicated experiments. ∗P < 0.05 versus Ech 0 μM; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus Ech 0 μM; &,
  P < 0.05 versus Ech 100 μM; &&, P < 0.01 versus Ech 100 μM.
