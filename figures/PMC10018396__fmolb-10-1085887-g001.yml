caption: Biosynthesis of glycoconjugate vaccine candidates against ETEC bacteria.
  (A) Biosynthesis of ETEC O148 O-PS from plasmid pMW07-O148, which encodes the entire
  O-PS locus from ETEC strain B7A (serotype O148:H28) between galF and gnd. (B) Glycoconjugate
  biosynthesis is enabled by combining engineered O-antigen biosynthesis with N-linked
  protein glycosylation by C. jejuni PglB (CjPglB). Several plasmid-encoded glycosyltransferases
  sequentially add the repeat-unit sugars to the lipid carrier undecaprenol pyrophosphate
  in the cytoplasmic membrane. The lipid-linked oligosaccharide is flipped by Wzx
  and polymerized by the Wzy polymerase, and subsequently transferred to “DQNAT” acceptor
  sites in the carrier protein by PglB. Deletion of waaL in the host strain is used
  to eliminate transfer of the O-PS to lipid A-core and ensure efficient transfer
  to the acceptor protein, while deletion of lpxM results in pentaacylated lipid A
  structure having significantly reduced toxicity. (C) Immunoblot analysis of purified
  carrier proteins derived from Escherichia coli CLM24 cells carrying a plasmid encoding
  either CRM1974xDQNAT or PD4xDQNAT along with plasmid pMW07-O148 encoding the ETEC
  O148 O-PS biosynthetic pathway and plasmid pMAF10 encoding wild-type CjPglB (wt)
  or an inactive mutant of CjPglB (mut) as indicated. Blots were probed with anti-His
  antibody to detect acceptor proteins and anti-ETEC O148 antibody to detect O-PS.
  Images depict aglycosylated and multiply glycosylated forms of CRM1974xDQNAT or
  PD4xDQNAT. Molecular weight (M W) markers are indicated on the left. Results are
  representative of three biological replicates.
