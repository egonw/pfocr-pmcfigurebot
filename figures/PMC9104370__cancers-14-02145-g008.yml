caption: (A) Clustering of lung adenocarcinoma samples using the genes in the xenobiotic
  metabolism hallmark gene set. (B) Mutations of KEAP1 are strongly enriched in the
  K2 cluster where the pathway appears to be activated. (C) Clustering of lung adenocarcinoma
  cell lines using the same gene set. (D) Also in cell lines mutations are enriched
  in the cluster showing pathway activation.
