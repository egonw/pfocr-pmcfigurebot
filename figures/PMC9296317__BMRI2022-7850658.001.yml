caption: SLC6A14 expression is positively induced in GC cells with strong metastatic
  ability. mRNA expression profiles in MKN28-M compared with MKN-28-NM (a–c) and in
  SGC7901-M compared with SGC7901-NM cells (d–f) were confirmed using mRNA microarray
  analysis. (a, d) Heat map depicting differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in which
  the upregulated and downregulated genes were represented by red and green columns,
  respectively (fold change ≥ 1.5 and∗P < 0.05). (b, e) The scatter plot indicating
  the distribution of signal intensity between different treatment groups on the rectangular
  coordinate plane. (c, f) Volcanic maps displaying significant difference were drawn
  based on the fold change and P values. (g) The Venn diagram showing 10 intersectional
  upregulated genes with a fold change ≥ 3 in their mRNA expressions in both MKN28-M
  and SGC7901-M, compared with MKN28-NM and SGC7901-NM cells, respectively. (h) Representative
  images of High-Content shRNA Screening for GATA6, PGM2L1, ARL2, SAMD13, CST1, ADAMTSL4,
  SPINK4, ACY3, RGS2, and SLC6A14 were obtained from wound healing assay (upper panels).
  The 2-day migration rate of MKN28-M cells that were transfected with indicated shRNAs
  was also demonstrated as the means ± SD of three replicates (bottom panel). ∗P <
  0.05 and∗∗P < 0.01 versus control. (i) Fold change of migration rate in MKN28-M
  cells with indicated transfections was calculated and was shown as the means ± SD
  from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 and∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus control. (j)
  SLC6A14 expression in different GC cell lines was checked using Western blot analysis.
  Data were represented as the strip maps (left panels) and relative gray values towards
  β-actin with the means ± SD from three irrelevant experiments (right panel). ∗∗P
  < 0.01 versus the SGC7901-NM and MKN28-NM group. (k) The migration capability of
  indicated GC cells was evaluated by wound healing assay. Data were demonstrated
  as the morphology of “wound strack” (left panels) and were also judged as the migration
  rate with the means ± SD from three triplicate experiments (right panel). ∗∗P <
  0.01 versus the SGC7901-NM and MKN28-NM group.
