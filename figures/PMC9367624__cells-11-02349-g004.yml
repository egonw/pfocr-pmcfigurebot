caption: Piezo1 activation relaxes pre-contracted IPA from the early stage of PH.
  On pre-contracted IPA (phenylephrine 0.1 µM), Piezo1 contracted Nx IPA but relaxed
  1W-CH IPA. (A) Typical trace of IPA tension recorded in the presence of Yoda1 on
  Nx (A1), 1W-CH (A2), or 3W-CH (A3). For Nx IPA, application of carbachol induced
  a relaxation, indicating a functional endothelium. For 1W-CH IPA, direct application
  of L-NAME (100 µM) converted the relaxation to a contraction, pointing out the importance
  of EC Piezo1 in the release of NO. Following 3W-CH, note the biphasic response (relaxation
  then contraction). (B) Statistical analysis of the contraction induced by Yoda1
  (2–20 μM) in Nx IPA. (C) Amplitude of the Yoda1-mediated relaxation in 1W-CH pre-contracted
  IPA. In the presence of L-NAME (100 µM), Yoda1 induced a contraction instead of
  relaxation. (D) Effect of 20 µM Yoda1 in 3W-CH IPA (amplitude of the relaxation
  then contraction). * p  <  0.05. The number inserted in the bar graph represents
  the number of arterial rings analyzed. Vertical arrow represents the beginning of
  the drugs’ application. ns = not significant. Minimum four different rats, at least
  four rings per rat were used.
