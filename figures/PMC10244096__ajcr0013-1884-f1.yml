caption: The expression of DBP in the liver tissues of human HCC. A. Relative expression
  of DBP mRNA in tumors and the adjacent liver tissues (n = 75 pairs). B. Representative
  WB images of DBP in tumors (T) and the adjacent (A) liver tissues. The corresponding
  quantitative data were presented (n = 22 pairs). C. Representative IHC staining
  images of DBP in tumors and the adjacent liver tissues. The corresponding staining
  intensities quantified by IHC score (n = 54 pairs) and by average intensity (n =
  20 pairs) were shown. The staining of DBP expressed in cancer tissues varied from
  khaki to dark brown, and most of the DBP expression in the adjacent tissues was
  negative. Scale bars = 50 μm. Data of IHC scores were presented as median and interquartile
  range. Data of average intensity were presented as mean ± SD. ***P<0.001 vs. Tumor
  group.
