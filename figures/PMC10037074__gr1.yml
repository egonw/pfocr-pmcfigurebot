caption: Link between gut microbiota and their metabolites and cardiovascular disease
  (CVD). ① Food and diet can cause CVD risk both through traditional pathways (increasing
  systemic lipidomics and inflammation) and through the metaorganism pathogenesis
  pathway (gut microbiota and host). ② Most food is digested and absorbed by the intestine,
  and nutrients are delivered via the portal vein to the liver for utilization. ③
  Undigested food and nutrients can be utilized by gut microbiota for their growth;
  the byproducts after such utilization are known as gut-microbiota metabolites. ④
  The metabolites of the gut microbiota, including trimethylamine (TMA), phenylacetic
  acid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, peptidoglycan, and short-chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs), are generated by gut microbiota. Some metabolites are pro-CVD risk
  factors, but others exert anti-inflammatory effects on human health. Both gut microbiota
  and their metabolites can translocate to the liver and other organs through the
  portal vein. ⑤ The liver is the first organ in the body's system to detoxify harmful
  gut-microbiota metabolites, and hepatic enzymes convert several compounds into CVD
  risk factors. ⑥ Gut-microbiota–derived metabolites increase CVD risk and systemic
  inflammation.
