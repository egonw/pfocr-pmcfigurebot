caption: 'Proposed hypothetical fatty acid oxidation pathway related to metabolites
  altered in group-by-time interaction among women who develop gestational diabetes
  mellitus (GDM). ABCDx: members of the peroxisomal ABC transporter family; CPT1:
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; CACT: carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase; CPT2:
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; CAT: carnitine acetyltransferase; FA-CoA: fatty
  acid-CoA; LCFA: long-chain fatty acid; LC acyl-carnitine: long-chain acyl-carnitine;
  LC-acyl-CoA: long-chain acyl-CoA; MC acyl-CoA: medium-chain acyl-CoA; MC acyl-carnitine:
  medium-chain acyl-carnitine; TCA Cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle; VLC-acyl-CoA:
  very long-chain acyl-CoA.'
