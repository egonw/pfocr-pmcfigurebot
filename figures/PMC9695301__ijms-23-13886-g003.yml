caption: 'Regulatory roles of polyphenols in the context of neuroinflammation: polyphenols
  inhibit the activation of astrocytes and transformation of microglia to pro-inflammatory
  phenotypes in the brain by inhibiting NF-κB pathway, reduce the secretion of inflammatory
  factors, improve the inflammatory environment in the brain and affect the phagocytosis
  of monocytes/ macrophages, to eventually alleviate AD symptoms. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; IL-6, interleukin-6;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide
  synthase.'
