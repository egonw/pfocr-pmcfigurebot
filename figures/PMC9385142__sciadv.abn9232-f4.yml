figure_title: Prediction of patient survival using splicing changes of CASEs
caption: (A) Proportion of CASEs and CALEs that are significantly correlated with
  patient survival at various cutoffs (P values from Cox regression). The difference
  between the proportion of CASE and CALE was evaluated with Fisher’s exact test.
  (B) KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment of the genes
  contained CASEs that correlated with patient survival with P < 0.01. (C) Forest
  plot of top CASEs significantly correlated with patient survival in all cancers
  (P < 10−10, Cox regression). HR, hazard ratio. (D) Kaplan-Meier curves of all cancer
  patients stratified by PSI values of four individual CASEs with the highest predictive
  power in (C). The top and bottom quartiles of patients ranked by the PSI values
  of each CASE are grouped as PSI high and PSI low. (E) Pipeline to calculate the
  risk factor based on the PSI values of eight CASEs (see Materials and Methods).
  The patients with the top and bottom quartiles ranked by the risk factor were defined
  as group 1 and group 2. (F) Kaplan-Meier curve of patients grouped by the CASE-based
  risk factor. The P value was calculated by Cox regression. (G) Survival time distribution
  of two groups of patients, which was grouped using the method in (D) in Chinese
  ESCC cohort. The P value was calculated by Student’s t test. (H) Immune cell infiltration
  defined by the relative fractions of different types of immune cells estimated using
  CIBERSORT in two groups of cancer patients (***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001; ns,
  not significant, by Student’s t test).
