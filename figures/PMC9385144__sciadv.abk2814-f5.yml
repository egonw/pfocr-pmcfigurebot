caption: (A to C) Total and phosphorylated protein levels of (A) p70S6K, (B) mTOR,
  and (C) Akt. Western blot analysis was performed from primary (−hTERT) and hTERT-immortalized
  cells (+hTERT) at low (L) and high (H) PDs in the absence or presence of H2O2 (200
  μM; 2 hours), as indicated. Light gray columns, healthy CON fibroblasts; dark gray
  columns, HGP fibroblasts. All protein levels were normalized to the protein levels
  of β-actin. Protein/β-actin ratios were expressed relative to those in low-PD cell
  samples (which were set at a value of 1). Means ± SEM, n = 4 cell lines per column
  (with two to three independent blots each). Each β-actin belongs to the same membrane
  as the respective protein (fig. S21). (D) Schematic summary of the suggested protective
  effect of TPE-OLD on PPP2R2C (PR55γ for the protein) induction. (E) Schematic illustration
  of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. PR55γ-mediated dephosphorylation of p70S6K has a
  direct inhibitory effect on protein synthesis and may thus stabilize cells in presenescence.
  Inhibition of p70S6K may additionally lead to a lower degree of Akt phosphorylation
  (). Magenta, oncogenes; turquoise, tumor suppressors; gray, not characterized. PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; 4E-BP1, 4E-binding protein 1.
