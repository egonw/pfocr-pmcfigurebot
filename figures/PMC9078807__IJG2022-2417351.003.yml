caption: By integrating the gene expression profiles of NB patients with the IRRGs
  downloaded from the Molecular Signatures database, a profile with 193 IRRG expressions
  from NB patients both in GEO dataset and TARGET dataset was obtained. Then, by comparing
  the 193 IRRGs between 183 INSS stage 4 and 53 INSS stage 4S NB patients in the GSE49710
  cohort, we extracted 58 DEIRRGs, which were visualized in the volcano plot and heat
  map (Figures  and ). In the GO functional analyses, the results indicated that DEIRRGs
  were mainly involved in inflammatory response, vasculature development, leukocyte
  differentiation, cell chemotaxis, chemokine production, and positive regulation
  of chemokine-mediated signaling pathway (). KEGG analysis suggested that DEIRRGs
  were mainly associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling
  pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, and TGF-beta signaling
  pathway (). Generally, the enrichment analyses showed that DEIRRGs not only play
  an important role in the inflammatory response but are also associated with tumorigenesis
  and tumor immune microenvironment.
