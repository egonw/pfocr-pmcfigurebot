caption: Myostatin inhibition MOA as add-on to SMN correctors in SMA. SMN protein
  promotes normal motor neuron function, which in turn provides the signals that activate
  and sustain muscle tissue (left). In SMA, insufficient SMN protein leads to degeneration
  of motor neurons and subsequent skeletal muscle atrophy (center). SMN correctors
  help to increase SMN protein production, stabilize neurodegeneration, and improve
  or maintain motor function, but may not return muscle to its normal size and function
  (right) Myostatin circulates as a complex of inhibitory prodomains. When the prodomains
  are proteolytically cleaved, the active myostatin dimer can bind to its receptor
  ActRIIB, The heterocomplex translocates to the nucleus where it regulates transcription.
  Several inhibitors of this signaling pathway have been developed including modified
  myostatin prodomain, modified follistatin, neutralizing monoclonal antibody and
  adnectin, ActRIIB-Fc, and ActRIIB blocking antibody. These strategies all lead to
  blocking myostatin binding to its receptor. Myostatin inhibition in combination
  with SMN correctors may directly address muscle atrophy and further restore motor
  function [, , –]. Apitegromab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the
  precursor, or inactive form of myostatin, blocking its activation in skeletal muscle.
  Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Apitegromab specifically
  targets the upstream pro and latent forms of myostatin, which avoids cross-reactivity
  with other TGF-ß ligands and inhibits activation of myostatin. Apitegromab improves
  muscle mass and strength with fewer off-target effects and related toxicities than
  possible with less selective myostatin inhibitors [, ]. Figure property of Scholar
