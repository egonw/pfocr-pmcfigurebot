caption: Role of Wnt signalling pathway in regulating energy metabolism. Wnt signalling
  promotes glycolysis by activating mTORC2 and therefore increases the expression
  of PFK1, a key enzyme in glycolysis. In addition, mTORC2 promotes PDK1 expression,
  thereby inhibiting pyruvate entry into mitochondria to participate in TCA cycle.
  Wnt signalling also promotes glutamine oxidation by stimulating mTORC1 and promoting
  the expression of glutaminase. When the content of β‐catenin changes, the catabolism
  of fatty acids is affected. Wnt pathway antagonists such as sclerotin inhibit the
  activation of Wnt signalling pathway, inhibit related metabolic processes and prevent
  the expression of downstream target genes related to bone remodelling. Dvl, Dishevelled;

  kinase 1; PFK1, phosphofructokinase 1; SOST, sclerostin
