figure_title: During optimal proliferation conditions, blocking Xrn1 import leads
  to inefficient mRNA synthesis and decay, without affecting mRNA levels
caption: 'GRO analysis was performed, in three replicates, as described in Method.
  Box and whisker plot of the median levels (in arbitrary units) of a transcription
  rate (TR); b half-lives (HLs). Each box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of
  values, with the median noted by the horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima
  or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever
  is closer. p-values were obtained by Wilcoxon rank sum test, ***: p < 0.001. c Defect
  in TR of xrn1ΔNLS1is correlated with that of xrn1ΔNLS1/2. Each spot represents an
  average of 3 replicates. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) are indicated. d Defects
  of mRNA decay (expressed as in C) of xrn1ΔNLS1is correlated with that of xrn1ΔNLS1/2.
  Each spot represents an average of 3 replicates. Pearson correlation coefficient
  (r) are indicated. e-h The effect of mutating NLSs on decay rates of specific mRNAs,
  determined by Northern blot hybridization. Decay assay described in Methods. Shown
  are mRNA levels, quantified using the PhosphorImager technology and normalized to
  SCR1 mRNA, as a function of time post-transcription arrest. n = 2 biologically independent
  experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). i For mRNAs with low
  Kis-values (bins 1-3), the effect of xrn1ΔNLS1/2mutations on HLs is comparable to
  ∆xrn1. mRNAs were arranged in a ascending order based on their kis-values and divided
  into 6 bins with equal number of genes. The ratios between HL in the mutant and
  that in WT is shown. Box and whisker plot of the log2 HLs ratios are shown. N = 3
  biological replicates. Each box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values,
  with the median noted by the horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima
  or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever
  is closer. Note that mRNAs in most bins were affected by XRN1 deletion. j Xrn1 and
  Xrn1ΔNLS1/2equally bind mRNA in vitro, as opposed to differential binding in vivo.
  In vivo or in vitro mRNA interactome profiles of WT and ΔNLS1/2 mutant forms of
  Xrn1-FLAG were determined, each condition in a duplicate, as follows. Condition
  I: in vivo. Live cells were UV cross linked followed by a standard RIP-seq. Condition
  II: in vitro. Purified Xrn1 samples were reacted in vitro with affinity purified
  poly(A) + mRNA followed by RIP-seq. For each condition, the log2 fold change (FC)
  of mutant to WT RIP-seq reads was computed, and the median taken within each of
  these predefined bins (see i). Centering was performed computationally. k Normal
  proliferation of cells carrying mutations in Xrn1 NLSs is dependent on SKI2. Synthetic
  sickness assay of NLSs mutants with ski2Δ. ski2Δ, xrn1-AID strains carrying the indicated
  plasmid were streaked on plates lacking (right panel) or carrying Auxin (that induced
  Xrn1-AID degradation). Photos were taken after 2 days at 30 oC. l During optimal
  conditions, mRNA abundance is unaffected by mutations in Xrn1 NLSs. mRNA abundance
  was determined (Methods). Each box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values,
  with the median noted by the horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima
  or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever
  is closer. p-values were obtained by Wilcoxon rank sum test and were found to be
  not significant (n.s.). Median values in arbitrary unit (A.U.) are indicated inside
  the plots. m mRNA Abundance (RA) in xrn1∆NLS1/2are correlated with those in WT.
  Each spot represents an average of 3 biological replicates. Pearson correlation
  coefficient (r) is indicated. n-o The effects of NLS1 (n) or NLS1/2 (o) disruption
  on transcription rates (TR) are correlated with their effects on HLs. Scatter-plot
  of log2 mutant/WT ratio. Each spot represents an average of 3 replicates. Pearson
  correlation coefficient (r) is indicated.'
