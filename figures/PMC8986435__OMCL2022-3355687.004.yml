caption: High casein concentration influenced biomarker metabolites in piglets. PLS-DA
  and OPLS-DA of microbial metabolites in colonic contents from piglets fed LP and
  HP. The (a) PLS-DA score plot is in negative ion mode. The (b) OPLS-DA score plot
  is in negative ion mode. The (c) PLS-DA score plot is in negative ion mode, and
  (d) the OPLS-DA score plot is in positive ion mode in different protein treatments.
  Validation plot of OPLS-DA model in (e) negative ion model and in (f) positive ion
  mode in the HP protein group. (g) Analysis of metabolic pathway enrichment. An overview
  of the metabolites that were shown to be abundant in piglets fed the HP diet compared
  to the LP diet.
