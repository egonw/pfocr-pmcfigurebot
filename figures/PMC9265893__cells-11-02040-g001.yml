caption: 'Ferroptosis regulatory pathways. Ferroptosis regulatory pathways can be
  roughly classified into three types: The first involve iron metabolism, including
  the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) regulation of ferritin degradation, and
  the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway, which affects iron. The second is the GSH/GPX4 pathway, including
  system Xc- inhibition, the transsulfuration pathway, mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway),
  glutamine pathway, and p53. The third type is that of lipid metabolism, including
  ACSL4, P53/SAT1/ALOX15, TPD52, and lipophagy, which are related to lipid regulation
  and ferroptosis, as well as the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway synergies with GPX4 and
  GSH, which reduce phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In addition, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress facilitates ferroptosis via ATF4-induced CHAC 1 expression.'
