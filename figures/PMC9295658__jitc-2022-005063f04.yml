caption: CD40 ×HER2 bsAb increased M1-like phenotype of TAMs, and overcame trastuzumab
  resistance in vitro. (A, B) Dose-dependent costimulatory activity of CD40 ×HER2
  bsAb on RAW264.7 cells (A) and THP1 cells (B) was shown (n=3). (C) Dose-dependent
  antitumor activity of CD40 ×HER2 bsAb on HER2-negative cell lines (AGS and SGC7901),
  and HER2-positive cell lines (NCI-N87 and KATO III) (n=5) was presented. (D, E)
  The stable control (vector +TAM group) and CCL2 overexpressing (overexpressed CCL2
  +TAM group) NCI-N87 and KATO III cells were cocultured with TAMs at a ratio 10:1.
  The CCL2 overexpressing NCI-N87 and KATO III cells cocultured with TAMs, were treated
  with the agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (overexpressed CCL2 +TAM+anti-CD40) or CD40
  ×HER2 bsAb (overexpressed CCL2 +TAM+ CD40×HER2 bsAb). Then, the mixed cells were
  incubated with the 50 µg/mL trastuzumab and CCK8 assay was performed to evaluate
  the drug sensitivity (D). The mixed cells were treated with the trastuzumab at gradient
  concentrations of from 0 to 1000 µg/mL and CCK8 assay was applied to measure the
  IC50(E) (n=4). (F–I) TAMs were cocultured with the stable control (vector group)
  and CCL2 overexpressing (overexpressed CCL2 group) gastric cancer cellsin a non-contact
  coculture transwell system. The coculture system of CCL2 overexpressing gastric
  cancer cells and TAMs was incubated with the agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (overexpressed
  CCL2 +anti-CD40 group) or CD40 ×HER2 bsAb (overexpressed CCL2 +CD40×HER2 bsAb group)
  treatment. EdU assay (F) was performed to present the live tumor cells under the
  treatment with 50 µg/mL trastuzumab (n=3). qPCR (G) and flow cytometry (H) were
  performed to analyze the polariton phenotype of TAMs with with CD40 ×HER2 bsAb treatment
  (n=3). And western blotting (I) was performed to analyze the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Results were shown as mean±SD. *P<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. bsAb, bispecific antibody.
