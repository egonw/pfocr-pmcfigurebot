caption: The concurrent CH mutations and anemia enhance the suppression of inflammatory
  pathways mediated by canakinumab. Pre- and post-treatment proteomic data from SomaScan
  and individual cytokine ELISA discovered more substantial suppression of inflammatory
  pathways by canakinumab in patients with CH mutations and anemia (CCUS) than patients
  with only CH mutations (CHIP). (A) Forest plot of mean differences in change of
  IL-6 (left), hepcidin (middle), and TNF-α (right) levels at months 3 and 12 in patients
  with CH mutations compared to those in patients without CH mutations, adjusted for
  baseline hemoglobin, hsCRP, and age. (B) Forest plot of mean differences in change
  of IL-6, hepcidin, and TNF-α levels at months 3 (top) and 12 (bottom) in patients
  with baseline anemia, compared to those in patients without baseline anemia among
  patients with CH mutations, adjusted for baseline hemoglobin, hsCRP, and age. (C)
  Changes of pathway enrichment scores associated with defense and immune response
  from baseline to months 3 (top) and 12 (bottom) of canakinumab treatment in patients
  stratified based on the presence of baseline anemia among patients with CH mutations,
  adjusted for baseline hemoglobin, hsCRP, and age. (D) Association of inflammation
  and erythroid response to canakinumab in patients with only CH mutations (CHIP)
  and concurrent CH mutations and anemia (CCUS). More elevated levels of inflammation
  and higher response to canakinumab were observed in patients with CCUS than in those
  with CHIP or no CH mutations.
