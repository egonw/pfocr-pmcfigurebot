caption: Correlation plot between experimental fluxes from the literature [] and in
  silico fluxes predicted by iBB1018, iBsu1103v2, and iYO844 models for TCA cycle
  (A), glycolysis (B), and pentose phosphate pathway (C). All the represented fluxes
  are measured in mmol gDW−1 h−1. The dots with wider borders contain overlapping
  values.
