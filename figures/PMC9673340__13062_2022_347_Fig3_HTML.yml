caption: Upregulation of SH3BP5-AS1 promotes pancreatic cancer cell resistance to
  gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. A, B Colony formation in BxPC-3 cells transfected
  with shCtrl or shSH3BP5-AS1 and treated with DMSO or GEM. C BxPC-3 cells with stable
  silencing of SH3BP5-AS1 were treated with GEM at different concentrations for 48 h.
  Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. D Stable SH3BP5-AS1-silenced BxPC-3 cells
  were treated with GEM (1 μM) for 48 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay
  at different timepoints. E Representative images of the xenograft tumors of BxPC-3
  cells with stable SH3BP5-AS1 silencing in nude mice following GEM or saline treatment.
  F, G Histograms displaying the tumor weight and volume. H Ki67 expression in BxPC-3
  cells with stable SH3BP5-AS1 silencing in nude mice after GEM or saline treatment.
  I Table summarizing the results of lung metastasis. J Representative images of H&E
  staining of the xenograft tumors. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
