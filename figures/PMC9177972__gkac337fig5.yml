caption: 'Khsrp mRNA is rapidly translated in axons after injury. (A) Schematic of
  nerve ligation model used for panels B and C. Proximal nerve is on the left and
  distal on the right as indicated. The nerve was ligated and then immediately crushed
  ∼1 cm distal to the ligation.(B, C) Confocal images for KHSRP protein in naïve (B)
  and post-crush injury (3 and 16 h; (C). Upper rows of image pairs show XYZ projections
  of merged signals for KHSRP (grey) and NF (magenta), while lower rows show ‘axonal
  KHSRP’ signals as from individual Z planes that were projected as an XYZ image.
  As in Figure , the strong signals that are outside of the axons are in Schwann cell
  nuclei based on DAPI co-labeling (data not shown). Representative images for ligation
  efficiency and KHSRP signals proximal and distal to ligation are shown in Supplemental
  Figure S4 [scale bar = 5 μm]. (D) Quantification of the axonal KHSRP immunoreactivity
  from ligation proximal and distal and crush sites are shown as mean ± SEM (N = 3
  animals per time point; * P ≤ 0.05 and ** P ≤ 0.01 for indicated time points versus
  naïve nerve, ††P ≤ 0.01 for indicated time points versus ligation proximal, and
  && P ≤ 0.01 for indicated time points versus ligation distal by Student''s t-test;
  ligation proximal versus distal have no significance). (E) Representative immunoblots
  for ex vivo puromycinylated naïve versus crushed sciatic nerve segments are shown
  as indicated. Protein synthesis inhibition with anisomycin completely blocks the
  puromycinylation of KHSRP in axoplasm samples extruded from the nerve segments,
  and GAPDH shows relatively equivalent protein loading across the lanes. Note that
  total KHSRP levels also increases with crush injury and this was attenuated by anisomycin.
  (F) Quantification of puromycinylated KHSRP signals from (D) is shown as mean ± SEM.
  Crush injury significantly increases axonal KHSRP synthesis and this blocked by
  anisomycin (N = 3; *** P ≤ 0.001 by one way ANOVA with Tukey''s post-hoc analysis).
  (G) FRAP analyses for distal axons of neurons transfected with GFPMYR5’/3’khsrp
  (schematic above graph) is shown as normalized average % recovery ± SEM. Pre-treatment
  with anisomycin or cycloheximide significantly attenuates the GFP recovery, indicating
  protein synthesis dependent recovery for GFPMYR fluorescence in the axons (N ≥ 10
  neurons over three culture preparations; * P ≤ 0.05, ** P ≤ 0.01 and *** P ≤ 0.005
  by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analyses for indicated time points versus
  control). Representative images sequences for FRAP are shown in Supplemental Figure
  S5. (I) Schematic for proposed signaling pathway for axotomy induced increase in
  axoplasmic Ca2+ leading to eIF2α phosphorylation is shown. GSK260614 was used as
  a specific PERK inhibitor and Sephin1 as an inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation.
  (H) FRAP analyses for distal axons of neurons transfected with GFPMYR5’/3’khsrp
  reporter is as normalized average % recovery ± SEM. Treatment with thapsigargin
  increased and BAPTA-AM decreased recovery over control conditions. The thapsigargin-induced
  increase was blocked by GSK260614, while the BAPTA-AM-induced decrease was partially
  blocked by Sephin1 (N ≥ 17 neurons over three culture preparations; # P ≤ 0.05,
  ## P ≤ 0.01, ### P ≤ 0.005 and #### P ≤ 0.001 for thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM versus
  corresponding control time points and +P ≤ 0.05, ++P ≤ 0.01, +++P ≤ 0.005 and ++++P ≤ 0.001
  for thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM versus corresponding thapsigargin + GSK260614 or BAPTA-AM + Sephin1
  time points by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analyses for indicated time
  points versus control; for data points appearing to error bars, the SEM is too small
  to show).'
