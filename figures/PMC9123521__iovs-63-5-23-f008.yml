caption: HFD alters immune-related circadian transcriptomic profiles. (A) Heatmaps
  of the differentially expressed immune-related genes (fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5,
  BH-adjusted P < 0.05). The expression levels of these genes at different times of
  the day were obtained by RNA-Seq analysis of ELGs. The color bar indicates the scale
  for transcript expression from blue to yellow across eight time points, with the
  expression range normalized to ±2. (B) Annotation of differentially expressed immune-associated
  transcripts from the KEGG pathway database (Q < 0.05). The top 10 annotated pathways
  are shown. The dashed lines represent Q = 0.05. (C) KEGG network diagram of differentially
  expressed immune-associated transcripts. The circles represent transcripts. The
  color and size of the circles indicate the number of transcripts connected to each
  node. The darker the color and the larger the box, the more transcripts connected
  to the node. Differently colored lines represent different pathway classifications.
  The red, blue, and yellow lines represent cellular processes, environmental information
  processing, and organismal systems, respectively. (D–F) GSEA results showing enrichment
  plots for activation of the immune response (D), adaptive immune response (E), and
  T cell receptor signaling pathway (F), in the ELGs of NC-1 and HFD mice.
