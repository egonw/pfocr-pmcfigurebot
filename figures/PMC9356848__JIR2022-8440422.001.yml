caption: Expression of ANTXR1, γ-globin, and β-catenin during erythroid differentiation.
  (a) Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of ANTXR1,
  γ-globin, and β-catenin in K562 cells and HUDEP-2 cells at days 0, 4, and 7 of erythroid
  differentiation. (b) Western blot analysis for the expression of ANTXR1, γ-globin,
  and β-catenin in umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells during erythroid differentiation
  at days 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. (c) Western blot analysis for the expression
  of ANTXR1, γ-globin, and β-catenin in adult peripheral blood CD34+ cells during
  erythroid differentiation at days 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. (d) Protein quantification
  of the western blot in HUDEP-2 cells ANTXR1, γ-globin, and β-catenin at days 0,
  4, and 7. (e) Quantification of western blot results of ANTXR1, γ-globin, and β-catenin
  in umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells at days 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. (f) Quantification
  of western blot results of ANTXR1, γ-globin, and β-catenin in adult peripheral blood
  CD34+ cells at days 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. These experiments n = 3. The error
  bar represents the SD. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
