caption: Burn, inhalation, and BI injuries induce significant alterations in peripheral
  immunometabolic canonical immune and metabolic signaling pathways compared to healthy
  controls. mRNA was isolated from PBMC, which was isolated from burn patients or
  healthy controls, and gene expression was evaluated using nanostring barcoding (nCounter
  Human Immune Profiling PanCancer CodeSet; 770 genes, and the Human Metabolic Gene
  CodeSet; 768 genes). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to detect significant
  (p < 0.05) changes in canonical immune and metabolic pathways and quantify Z-scores.

  Systemic Immunometabolism and Long-Term Patient Outcomes.
