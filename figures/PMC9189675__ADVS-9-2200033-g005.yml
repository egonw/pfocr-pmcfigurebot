caption: Activated B cells after MWA of breast cancer, with activated antigen receptor‐mediated
  signaling pathway (n = 6). A) UMAP analysis of peripheral B cells showing 5 clusters
  before and after MWA. B) The proportions of each B cell cluster before and after
  ablation. GO enrichment pathway analysis of genes preferentially upregulated in
  C) TCL1A+B cells and D) CLECL1+B cells after MWA in comparison to that before MWA.
  E) Antigen processing and presentation scores of TCL1A+B cells and CLECL1+B cells
  before and after ablation. F) Volcano plot showing upregulated genes of peripheral
  plasma B cells induced by MWA of breast cancer. G) GO enrichment analysis showing
  upregulated pathways in plasma B cells induced by MWA of primary breast cancer.
