caption: Genetic pathologies linked with epilepsy and ASD. Synaptic plasticity can
  be altered by epilepsy or seizures in an early phase of infantile development leading
  to ASD. Anomalies in neural plasticity can be a result of malfunctioning neurotrophins,
  signaling molecules, or receptors, resulting in a 30% reduction in dendritic spine
  density in hippocampus (Cornu Ammonis) CA3 neurons and a 40% reduction in prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) neurons. Several genes involved in autism and epilepsy pathogenesis
  have been linked to this biochemical pathway critical in brain development and function.
