caption: Changes in the ammonia (NH3) content of WT and atg5 Physcomitrella colonies
  following their transfer from BCDAT to BCDATG medium. Seven-day-old WT and atg5
  Physcomitrella colonies grown on BCDAT agar medium were transferred to BCDATG liquid
  medium and grown under light conditions. NH3 content in WT and atg5 mutants was
  measured immediately (0 d) and 1 d after transfer. Data are shown as means Â± SD
  (n = 3, ** p < 0.01).
