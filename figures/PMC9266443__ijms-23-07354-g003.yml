caption: VEGFR2-mediated gene regulation and pathway enrichment in HRMECs. (A) Visualization
  of the VEGF-induced VEGFR2-mediated genes (VEGF-treated KDR siRNA-transfected HRMECs
  (KV) group compared to the VEGF-treated control siRNA-transfected HRMECs (CV) group)
  by volcano plot from the KDR RNA-seq dataset (black dashed line represents significance
  threshold value of âˆ’log(adjusted p-value) = 1.30; the color gradient visually depicts
  the fold of gene upregulation (red) and downregulation (blue) in the KV group compared
  to the CV group); (B) visualization of the common genes between the VEGF-mediated
  genes (i.e., CV vs. C) and the VEGF-induced VEGFR2-mediated genes (KV vs. CV) by
  a Venn diagram (color gradient visually depicts the relatively higher number of
  gene counts (red) or relatively lower number of gene counts (blue); (C) hierarchical
  clustering of the VEGF-induced VEGFR2-mediated genes identified four different clusters
  of gene expression patterns (row dendrogram, color gradient represents higher (red)
  or lower (blue) Z-score values of the RLog transformed read counts for each biologic
  sample (n = 12, column dendrogram) relative to each gene); (D) Venn diagram depicting
  the overlap of VEGF-mediated genes (CV vs. C) with the VEGF-induced VEGFR2 (KV vs.
  CV) hierarchical clusters; bubble plots depicting the significantly enriched and
  significantly activated or inactivated pathways associated with the VEGF-induced
  VEGFR2-mediated genes from (E) cluster 2 or (F) cluster 3 (size of bubble directly
  correlates with the significance of pathway enrichment, color gradient visually
  depicts the predicted strength of activation (red) or inhibition (blue) of enriched
  pathways by IPA, gene ratio (x-axis label) was calculated by taking the number of
  genes from the uploaded dataset that was associated with a canonical pathway (y-axis
  labels), and dividing it by the total number of genes from the IPA knowledge database
  associated with that respective canonical pathway.
