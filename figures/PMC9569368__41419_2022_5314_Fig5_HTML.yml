figure_title: CASZ1b directly activates neuronal differentiation genes
caption: A Composite plots of the 598 upregulated genes before (Tet-) after (Tet+)
  induction of CASZ1b in SY5Y cells, which show increased CASZ1b signals (left panel)
  and H3K27ac signals (middle panel) at the CASZ1b peak center, as well as increased
  signals of RNA Pol II on the gene body (right panel). B Composite plots of the 397
  genes directly downregulated by CASZ1, which show increased CASZ1b signals (left
  panel) and decreased signals of H3K27ac (middle panel) at the CASZ1b peak center,
  as well as decreased signals of RNA Pol II on the gene body (right panel). C Ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) shows that CASZ1b directly regulated genes are involved in
  nervous system and tissue development. D IPA shows that CASZ1b directly regulated
  genes are enriched in the positive regulation of neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis.
