caption: Genistein regulates the promoter region of Vmp1 via NF-κB. (A) qRT-PCR of
  miR-21 expression in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS and PDTC (10 μM, 0.5 h). (B)
  The binding sites for NF-κB in Vmp1 promoter region. (C) RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected
  with the promoter and reference reporter gene vector (pGL3-Basic and pRL-CMV) and
  treated with LPS and PDTC (10 μM, 0.5 h), and then, the luciferase activity was
  measured. (D) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with NF-κB p65 overexpression vector
  (pcDNA3.1) following LPS and genistein exposure, and the luciferase value was detected.
  (E) ChIP-qPCR assays indicated that NF-κB was recruited to the promoter region of
  miR-21 in RAW264.7 cells after LPS treatment, but the enrichment decreased with
  genistein exposure. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides; PDTC, Pyrrolidine Dithiocarbamate, inhibitor of NF-κB;
  TSS, transcription start site; GEN, genistein; ns, nonsignificant (P > 0.05); *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
