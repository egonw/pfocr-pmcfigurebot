figure_title: circNFKB1 regulates NFKB1 expression and sustains NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: a qRT-PCR analysis showing NFKB1 mRNA levels after circNFKB1 knockdown in
  HCs. b Western blotting analysis showing p105, p50 and p65 phosphorylation protein
  levels in circNFKB1 knockdown chondrocytes. c qRT-PCR analysis showing NFKB1 mRNA
  levels after circNFKB1 overexpression in HCs. d Western blotting analysis showing
  p105, p50, and p65 phosphorylation protein levels in circNFKB1 overexpressed chondrocytes.
  e Immunofluorescence staining of NFKB1 (upper panels) and p-p65 (lower panels) of
  chondrocytes in the indicated groups at 8 weeks after first injection or DMM surgery
  (n = 5 mice). Scale bars, 50 μm. f Quantification of NFKB1 and p-p65 positive cells
  were performed according to staining results (n = 5 per group). a–d, f, mean values ± SD
  are shown, and p values were calculated by two-tailed Student’s t test (c, d, f)
  or one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test (a, b). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. b, d, e, representative images are shown.
