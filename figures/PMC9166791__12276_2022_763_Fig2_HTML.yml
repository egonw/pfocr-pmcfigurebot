figure_title: RTN3 levels are decreased in CKD patients
caption: a, b Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of RTN3 in normal
  individuals (n = 2) and CKD patients (n = 4). c IHC analysis showing RTN3 expression
  levels in kidney tissues from healthy control subjects (n = 4) or CKD patients (n = 24).
  The red dots represent samples with lower RTN3 levels. d PAS, Masson, and IHC staining
  showing the conditions of glomerulosclerosis, kidney fibrosis, and RTN3 expression
  among patients with CKD of different stages. e Statistical analysis of Masson staining
  and IHC in the healthy group, slight-glomerulosclerosis group, and severe-glomerulosclerosis
  group.
