caption: '(a) Identification of DEGs in intrauterine adhesions. Volcano plot showing
  the DEGs within the Wnt signaling pathway identified from GSE160633 that demonstrated
  the expression of 17 upregulated and 11 downregulated genes in the Wnt signaling
  pathway after differential expression analysis by R package “edgeR.” (b) Wnt signaling
  pathway of intrauterine adhesions. Green colour: significant downregulation genes;
  red colour: upregulated genes; grey colour: no significant expression genes.'

  Regeneration and Repair of Intrauterine Adhesions.
