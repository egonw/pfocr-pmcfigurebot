caption: 'NF-kB activity is suppressed by BDP-9066 via inhibition of YAP/TAZ. (A and
  B) Pathway analysis was performed using genes that were downregulated in BT549 cells
  treated with BDP-9066. The results using Gene Ontology (Biological Process) (A)
  and KEGG (B) database are shown, respectively. (C) Western blotting was performed
  to analyze the expression levels of total p65 and phosphorylated p65 (pS536) after
  treatment with BDP-9066 in the sensitive and resistant cell lines. (D) The TCGA
  RPPA data was analyzed to determine p65 phosphorylation levels in different subtypes
  of breast cancer. The P value for each pair; P= HER2-Basal: 0.9804435, LumA-Basal:
  0.0000022, LumB-Basal: 0.0000075, LumA-HER2: 0.0032619, LumB-HER2: 0.0024520, LumB-LumA:
  0.9342813. (E) The TCGA RNA sequencing data was analyzed to determine RELA expression
  levels in different subtypes of breast cancer. The P value for each pair; HER2-Basal:
  0.0019109, LumA-Basal: 0.0003119, LumB-Basal: 0.0000000, LumA-HER2: 0.6992430, LumB-HER2:
  0.7464300, LumB-LumA: 0.0086262. (F) In the TCGA dataset, breast cancer patients
  were divided into a group with high RELA expression and a group with low RELA expression
  in their tumors, and the relationship between YAP1 expression level and overall
  survival was investigated in each group. YAP1 expression was associated with shorter
  survival in RELA-high group (p=0.008), but not RELA-low groups (p=0.18). (G) The
  effect of BDP-9066 on p65 phosphorylation in BT549 cells expressed constitutively
  activated YAP and the vector control cells was examined by Western blotting. (H)
  The effect of BDP-9066 on p65 phosphorylation in CTGF-treated or untreated BT549
  cells was examined by Western blotting.'
