caption: Combined functional analysis of differentially expressed genes between MeRIP-seq
  and RNA-seq data. (a) Four-quadrant plot showing the genes with differential changes
  in both m6A modification level and post-transcriptional mRNA level in the bilirubin
  group compared with the control group. The red dots represent genes with significant
  differences in m6A modification and mRNA expression between the bilirubin and control
  groups. (b) GO analysis of BP performed for differentially expressed genes identified
  through both MeRIP- and RNA-seq analyses. (c) GO analysis of MF of significantly
  differentially expressed genes identified through both MeRIP- and RNA-seq analyses.
  (d) GO analysis of CC of significantly differentially expressed genes identified
  through both MeRIP- and RNA-seq analyses. (e) KEGG pathway analysis of the MeRIP-seq
  and RNA-seq data
