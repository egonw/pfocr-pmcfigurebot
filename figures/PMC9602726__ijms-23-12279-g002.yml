caption: 'Effects of GDF11 on apoptosis and cell cycle of PC12 cells. (A) GDF11 promoted
  apoptosis in PC12 neural stem cells. PC12 cells were treated with various concentrations
  of GDF11 (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL) for 72 h, and then were assessed on a
  flow cytometry by using Annexin V−FITC and PI dual staining: Lower left quadrant;
  live cells (Annexin V−/PI−); Lower right quadrant: early/primary apoptotic cells
  (Annexin V+/PI−); Upper right quadrant: late/secondary apoptotic cells (Annexin
  V+/PI+); Upper left quadrant: necrotic cells (Annexin V−/PI+). (B) Quantitative
  analyses of apoptosis as in (A). (C) GDF11 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.
  PC12 cells were incubated with GDF11 (0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL) or vehicle
  for 72 h and analyzed by Flow cytometry. (D) Histogram of cell cycle distribution
  as in (C). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
