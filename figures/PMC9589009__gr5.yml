caption: 'Gene expression analysis of the TGF and Notch pathway in the cartilage.
  The expression of TGF-β1, BMP-2, BMP-6, ID1, PAI1, and TGF-β-RII of the TGF pathway,
  and Notch -1,-2, and -4 of the Notch signalling pathway is shown as the relative
  gene expression compared to the mean of all samples within a gene. Gene expression
  analysis was performed at 18 and 28 weeks for the osteoarthritic (OA), and OA treated
  with knee joint distraction (OA ​+ ​KJD) joints. As the bone (tibia or femur) was
  found to not be a determining factor in the statistical analysis, the shown expression
  represents the gene expression of the whole joint. The Individual coloured dots
  represent individual donors. ∗∗p ​< ​0.01; ∗p ​< ​0.05; # 0.15 ​> ​p ​> ​0.05 with
  a large ES.'
