caption: 'BHRS treatment inhibited the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A, B) The protein levels of TLR4 and MyD88 and the phosphorylation of IκB, and
  NF-κBp65 in liver were detected using western blot and the relative expressions
  of proteins were quantified based on grayscale values using Image J analysis software.
  β-actin was used as the loading control. For detecting the phosphorylation of proteins,
  the relative expression was calculated by the specific value of phosphorylated protein
  to total protein. (C) The gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
  IL-6 and TNF-α) in liver were detected using qPCR. #: p < 0.05 as compared to the
  control group; ##: p < 0.01 as compared to the control group; *: p < 0.05 as compared
  to the T2DM group; **: p < 0.01 as compared to the T2DM group.'
