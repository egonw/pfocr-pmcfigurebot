caption: Raf1 is overexpressed in T-cell lymphoma tissues. (A) Raf1 expression in
  lymphoid neoplasm DLBC and normal tissues was analyzed from mRNA sequencing data
  from TCGA database. Red denotes cancer tissue, and gray denotes normal tissue. (B)
  mRNA expression levels of Raf1 in cancerous lymph nodes vs. adjacent normal tissues
  from T-cell lymphoma patients, and in stage III/IV vs. stage I/II tumor tissues.
  (C) Immunohistochemistry staining of Raf1 in cancerous lymph nodes or adjacent normal
  tissues from T-cell lymphoma patients. Magnification, Ã—400. (D) Western blot analysis
  of protein expression of Raf1 in cancerous lymph nodes or adjacent normal tissues
  from T-cell lymphoma patients. ***P<0.001. DLBC, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma;
  TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
article_title: BPTF activates the MAPK pathway through coexpression with Raf1 to promote
  proliferation of T-cell lymphoma.
