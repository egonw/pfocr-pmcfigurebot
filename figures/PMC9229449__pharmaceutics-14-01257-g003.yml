caption: 'Analysis of cell apoptosis in HO-3867-treated U2OS and HOS cells. (A) After
  treatment with experimental concentration range of HO-3867 for 24 h, Annexin V-FITC/PI
  staining was performed to analyze DNA contents in U2OS and HOS cells. (B,C) The
  Annexin V-positive cells were subsequently quantified. U2OS: n = 6, F = 355.589,
  p < 0.001; HOS: n = 5, F = 18.887, p < 0.001. a Significantly different, p < 0.05,
  when compared to control. b Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to
  2 μM. c Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to 4 μM. d Significantly
  different, p < 0.05, when compared to 8 μM.'
