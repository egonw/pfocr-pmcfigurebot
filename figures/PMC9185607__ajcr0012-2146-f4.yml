caption: Expression of EMT, angiogenesis and myogenesis gene sets were enriched in
  high Apical Junction Pathway score gastric cancer on GSEA in both TCGA and GSE84437
  cohorts (FDR <0.25, respectively). EMT, epithelial mesenchymal transition; GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; TCGA, the cancer genome atlas; FDR, false discovery
  rate.

  metastatic potential and worse clinical outcomes.
