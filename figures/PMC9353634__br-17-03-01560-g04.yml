caption: Effect of cilostazol on ET-1 and eNOS expression in HUVECs after pre-treatment
  with the p-p38 inhibitor (SB203580). (A) Representative western blots of ET-1 and
  eNOS. Quantitative analysis of the western blotting results of (B) ET-1 and (C)
  eNOS. The results are presented as the mean Â± SEM of three repeats. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  ET-1, endothelin-1; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ns, not significant.
article_title: Cilostazol regulates the expressions of endothelin-1 and endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase via activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HUVECs.
