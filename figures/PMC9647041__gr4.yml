caption: The NSP, via RPL5 and RPL11, is required to stabilize p53 in response to
  a broad range of genetic, pharmacological, and pathophysiologic stressesTo identify
  which candidate genes are required for the canonical NSP, we rescreened a selection
  of candidates from the primary p53 stabilization screen described in  (ribosomal
  proteins, nucleolar/RiBi candidates, and “other” p53 positive candidates, 232 genes
  in total) in the presence of non-targeting, RPL5, RPL11, HEATR3, or RPS19 siRNAs
  in A549 cells (A). From this analysis, we further quantified the number of candidates
  screened from each group (ribosomal proteins, nucleolar/RiBi, and other) for which
  their p53 response could be suppressed by ≥50% when co-depleted with RPL5, RPL11,
  HEATR3, or RPS19 siRNAs (B). We further tested a panel of pharmacological agents
  and pathophysiological stressors when A549 cells were depleted of RPL5 and RPL11
  for 48 h. Cells were treated for 24 h with pharmacological agents actinomycin D
  (ACTD, 5 nM), α-amanitin (2.5 μM), doxorubicin (DRB, 500 nM), 5-fluoruracil (5-FU,
  50 μM), etoposide (ETO, 50 μM), camptothecin (CPT, 50 nM), leptomycin B (LMB, 10 ng/mL),
  or MG132 (10 μM). Alternatively, cells were treated with pathophysiological stressors
  UV (50 J/m2), gamma irradiation (10 Gy), or subjected to heat shock (45°C, 30 min),
  then incubated at 37°C for 3 h post treatment. At the end of treatment, protein
  was harvested and subjected to western blot analysis for p53 and p21 protein expression
  (C). The same panel of stressors (and treatment conditions) was tested on mouse
  embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from either Mdm2 wild-type (WT) or mice homozygous
  for the Mdm2 C305F mutation (C305F) to determine p53 expression (D). n = 3–4 biological
  replicates for each condition, and the most representative experiment for each treatment
  is presented.
