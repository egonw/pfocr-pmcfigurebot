caption: Estrogen deficiency led to osteoporosis and increased CCL2 and CCL7 levels
  in OVX and aged female mice. (A) Representative μ‐CT of the proximal tibiae of sham,
  OVX and aged mice rendered in 3D (n = 5 per group). (B–C) BMD was decreased significantly
  in OVX and aged mice (P = 0.012, P < 0.001). and the SMI (C) was increased obviously
  in OVX and aged mice (P = 0.013, P < 0.001) (D) Representative TRAP staining of
  the proximal tibia (n = 5 per group). (E–G) The numbers of osteoclasts, sizes of
  osteoclasts and osteoclast surface area‐to‐bone surface area ratios were increased
  significantly in the OVX and aged mouse groups (all P < 0.05) (H‐J) CCL2 and CCL7
  levels under the growth plate were increased in the OVX and aged mice (all P < 0.05).
  One‐way ANOVA and Tukey's test; ns, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001.
