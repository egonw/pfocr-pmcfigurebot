caption: 'Cell-to-cell systems schema related to the glioma microenvironment. Glioma
  cells form the tumor environment, developing microtube networks, erythropoietin-producing
  human hepatocellular receptor (Ephs)–ephrin pathways, and Notch signals. Cell-to-cell
  systems are mainly associated with invasion (red line), proliferation (green dotted
  line), stemness maintenance (black dotted line), and phenotypic regulation (blue
  dotted line) in glioma cells. Invasion ability is acquired from the microtube network,
  EphB–ephrin-B pathway, and Notch signaling. Cell proliferation and stemness maintenance
  are involved in the ephrinA–ephrinA pathway and Notch signaling. The glioma phenotype
  is regulated by the microtube network, EphA–ephrinA pathway, and Notch signaling.
  P in a grey circle indicate the phosphorylation. Abbreviation: NICD; notch intracellular
  domain.'
