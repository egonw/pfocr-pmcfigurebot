caption: Mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators are activated in DN glomeruli.
  a Dot plot displaying the commonly changed transcriptional regulations in both single-cell
  and bulk RNA-seq data estimated by IPA. b Heatmap showing the activity z scores
  of transcription factors estimated by SCENIC. c Heatmap showing the log2FC (DN vs.
  Ctrl) values of MRTF transcriptional target genes in mice glomerular cells. Nonsignificant
  genes are shown in gray (a, c). d Immunofluorescence staining of the mouse kidney
  paraffin sections showing the expression and localization of MRTFA and MRTFB in
  control and DN glomeruli. Glomerular endothelial cells were labeled by EMCN (endomucin),
  podocytes were labeled by NPHS1 (Nephrin), nuclei were counterstained with HOECHST.
  Arrows indicate mesangial cells, which were negative for EMCN and NPHS1
