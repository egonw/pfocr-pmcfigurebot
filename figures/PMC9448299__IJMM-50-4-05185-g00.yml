caption: The expression of ZNF667 and angiogenesis were increased in the ischemic
  myocardium of AMI mice. (A) The statistics histogram of myocardial infarct size
  of mice on day 14 after LAD ligation (n=5 per group). (B) Morphological and pathological
  changes of myocardium were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining on day 14
  following surgery (Scale bar=100 µm). (C) The expression of CD31 (upper) and ZNF667
  (lower) in the ischemic myocardium (left ventricle) of mice was detected by immunohistochemistry
  on day 14 following surgery (Scale bar=50 µm). (D) Microvessel density was calculated
  by identifying five fields from an area of highest vascular density in the ischemic
  myocardium per slide of each sample and counting at low power lens (n=5 per group).
  (E) The statistics histogram of positive expression of ZNF667 in the ischemic myocardium
  (left ventricle) of mice (n=5 per group). (F) Expression of ZNF667 in the left ventricle
  of mice on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 following surgery was detected by immunoblotting.
  (G) Quantification of immunoblot analysis of ZNF667 (n=3 per group). (H) The expression
  of CD31 and ZNF667 in the serial ischemic myocardium sections of AMI mice on day
  14 following surgery were detected by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar (left)=200
  µm, (right)=50 µm. The arrows indicate the co-localization of positive expression
  of CD31 and ZNF667. (I) Quantification of positive expression rate of ZNF667 in
  CD31-positive cells in the ischemic myocardium of AMI mice (n=5 per group). Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation. ZNF667, zinc finger protein 667; AMI,
  acute myocardial infarction; LAD, left anterior descending coronary artery.
