caption: 'ASPS did not cause any toxic effects on radiation-damaged C. elegans. (a)
  The body bends. n = 20. (b) The head thrashes. n = 20. (c) The number of offspring.
  n = 20. (d) The average lifespan. n = 3. Significant difference from the control
  group was designated as * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01, and significant difference from
  the radiation group was designated as #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01, respectively.'
