caption: Cell communication networks of FIB, EC and immune cells contribute to widespread
  decidualization features at the WOI. (A) Overview of selected ligand-receptor interactions;
  P values indicated by circle size, and scale on right. The means of the average
  expression level of interacting molecule 1 in cluster 1 and interacting molecule
  2 in cluster 2 were indicated by color. (B) Circos plot of interaction network for
  endometrial immune cells (left). The ribbons connect each ligand to the assigned
  receptors. The color of a ribbon is consistent with the color at the receptor side
  to ligand side. And ligand and receptor genes involved in each cluster were selected
  to perform pathway analysis (right). Pathway with P < 0.05 are shown. Gene number
  of each pathway is listed on the left. P value is shown as -log 10 (P value). (C)
  Cell interaction of immune cells (NK, Mo/MÏ†, ligands), endometrial non-immune cells
  (FIB, EC and VASCs, receptors). Pathway and function of cell interactions were mainly
  involved in cell adhesion, cell growth and differentiation, tissue modeling, inflammatory
  response and angiogenesis.
