caption: Effect of EA on the migration of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. (A
  and B) Migration of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells following treatment with EA for the
  indicated durations, as determined by wound-healing assay. Scale bar, 250 µm. Representative
  of biologically independent samples, n=3. (C and D) Migration of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3
  cells following treatment with EA for 24 h, as determined by Transwell migration
  assay. Scale bar, 100 µm. Representative of biologically independent samples, n=5.
  (E and F) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of EMT-related proteins
  at 48 h in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells. β-actin was used as a control. All data are
  shown as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. EA, eupalinolide A.
article_title: Eupalinolide A induces autophagy via the ROS/ERK signaling pathway
  in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.
