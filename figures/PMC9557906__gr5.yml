caption: miR-181a-5p modulates the AKT3-FOXO3-IL-23R/CCL5 pathway in Th17 cells(A
  and B) Western blot analysis for AKT pathway-associated protein in Th17 cells infected
  with LV-Ctrl or LV-181a (MOI =50) in vitro (A), and in CD4+ T cells isolated from
  LV-Ctrl or LV-181a-infected EAU mice (B). Statistical analysis data are shown in
  the right panel (n = 4 per group).(C) Representative confocal images of FOXO3 (red)
  immunofluorescent staining in EL4 T cells infected with LV-Ctrl or LV-181a for 48 h
  through a ×63 oil immersion objective. Scale bars, 5 μm.(D and F) Luciferase activity
  analysis of reporter carrying Il23r promoter (D) or Ccl5 promoter (F) co-transfected
  into HEK293T with the indicated plasmids (n = 3–4 per group).(E) Real-time qRT-PCR
  analysis of Ccl5 expression in Th17 cells infected with FOXO3 lentivirus (LV-FOXO3)
  or control lentivirus (LV-control) (n = 4 per group). Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM of at least three independent experiments. In the statistical analysis, Student’s
  t test (A and B), One-way ANOVA (D, F), and Mann-Whitney U test (E) were used with
  significance defined as ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01. See also .
