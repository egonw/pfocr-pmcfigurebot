caption: Knock−down of G6PD promoted skeletal muscle cells’ response to insulin. (a)
  Western blot analysis for G6PD, GLUT4 and insulin signaling pathway associated protein
  after G6PD siRNA transfection with or without 100 nM insulin. (b) Immunofluorescence
  assay of GLUT4 translocation on cell membrane after G6PD siRNA transfection under
  100 nM insulin; GLUT4 was stained as red, Laminin was stained as green and cell
  nuclei were stained as blue; scale bar = 50 μm. (c,d) Flow cytometry assay of GLUT4
  translocation on cell membrane after G6PD siRNA transfection under 100 nM insulin.
  (e,f) Flow cytometry assay for glucose uptake detection after G6PD siRNA transfection
  by 2-NBDG under 100 nM insulin. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. MFI, median fluorescence
  intensity.
