caption: 'Sketch of LD dynamics determined by LD-associated proteins. LD biosynthesis
  is initiated with lipid accumulation between the two ER membrane leaflets. DGAT1
  and DGAT2 catalyze the last step of TAG synthesis. After budding off, LDs expand
  through coalescence mediated by CIDEs and local TAG synthesis catalyzed by DGAT2
  on their surface. A portion of ATGL is attached to the surface and triggers the
  first step of TAG hydrolysis, which could be impeded by perilipins on the LD surface
  under basal conditions. A stress-activated cAMP-PKA pathway phosphorylates perilipins
  and removes the block. G0S2 is another LD protein that inhibits TAG hydrolysis.
  Abbreviations: LD, lipid droplet; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DGAT, diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; TAG, triacylglycerol; CIDE, cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation
  factor alpha (DFFA)-like effector; ATGL, adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A.'
