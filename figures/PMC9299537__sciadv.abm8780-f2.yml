figure_title: KRAS signaling down-regulates IFN pathway gene expression via MYC
caption: (A) qPCR analysis of IFN-induced genes in MRTX1257-treated (100 nM, 24 hours)
  3LL ΔNRAS cells (2−ΔΔCT, normalized to control sample for all genes, n = 6, unpaired
  t test, mean + SEM). (B) Same as (A) using KPB6G12C (n = 4) and CT26G12C (n = 3)
  cell lines. (C) qPCR showing KRAS-dependent regulation of Myc in 3LL ΔNRAS cells
  (n = 3) after treatment with MRTX1257 and KRASG12V-ER pneumocytes (n = 4) after
  treatment with 4-OHT (unpaired t test, mean + SEM). (D) RNA-seq mRNA counts of 3LL
  ΔNRAS lung tumors treated with vehicle or MRTX1257 (50 mg/kg) for 28 hours or 8
  days (each dot represents a tumor, n = 6 per group, FDR P adjusted value). (E) Western
  blot showing MYC knockdown and STAT2 up-regulation of 3LL ΔNRAS cells treated with
  100 nM MRTX1257 (24 hours), Myc small interfering RNA (siRNA; 48 hours), or both.
  Quantification for two independent experiments is shown on the right (mean + SEM).
  (F) qPCR analysis of IFN-induced genes in 3LL ΔNRAS cells treated with 100 nM MRTX1257,
  Myc siRNA, or both (2−ΔΔCT, normalized to control sample for all genes, n = 3, paired
  t tests, siMyc versus Mock, mean + SEM). (G) Same analysis as (F) in KPB6G12C (n
  = 4) and CT26G12C (n = 3) cells.
