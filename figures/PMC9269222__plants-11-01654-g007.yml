caption: 'Autophagy control by stress stimulated ABA and ethylene signaling. Autophagy
  genes can be transcriptionally activated by ABA and ethylene signaling during nutrient
  starvation as well as environmental stress. On the left, the figure shows how ABA
  signaling is modified under stress. The right column shows the signaling pathway,
  leading to ethylene mediated stimulation of autophagy activity. Abbreviations: ATG8:
  Autophagy-related protein 8; COST1: Constitutively stressed 1, a protein attenuating
  autophagy by interacting with the autophagy adaptor protein ATG8E; RAPTOR: Regulatory-associated
  protein of TOR, an adaptor protein; TOR: Target of rapamycin, a serine/threonine
  protein kinase; TSPO: An 18 kDa translocator protein required to alter the autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway.'
