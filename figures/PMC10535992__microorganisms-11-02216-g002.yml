caption: Differential expression analysis in P. lima under different levels of P-limitation
  and a P-replete control. (A) Differential gene volcano map between 1/4 P-limited
  and P-replete conditions. (B) Differential gene volcano map between 1/16 P-limited
  and P-replete conditions. The horizontal axis represents the multiple changes in
  gene expression, while the vertical axis represents the significance level of differential
  genes (log2 fold change). The red dots represent up-regulated genes, the green dots
  represent down-regulated genes, and the blue dots represent insignificantly altered
  genes. (C) KEGG classification between 1/4 P-limited and P-replete conditions. (D)
  KEGG classification between 1/16 P-limited and P-replete conditions. The horizontal
  axis represents the proportion of the number of differentially expressed genes annotated
  to this pathway to the number of differentially expressed genes annotated, while
  the vertical axis represents the name of the KEGG pathway.
