caption: Activation the IFNγ/JAK/STAT1 pathway can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation
  by inducing cell cycle arrest. (a)–(d) Cell cycle analysis of NSCLC cells (H1299,
  PC-9, H1975 and H3255) treated with or without IFNγ/STAT3 inhibitor by flow cytometry.
  All data was illustrated as mean ± SD and the asterisks show significant difference
  as compared with the IFNγ group or STAT3 inhibitor group shown by a horizontal line
  (∗P < 0.05∗∗P < 0.01).
