caption: KRT80 regulates the EMT process of NSCLC cells by mediating the TGF-β/SMAD
  pathway. (a and b) The Transwell assay was conducted to measure the number of migrating
  and invaded A549 cells (Scale bar = 40 μm). (c) The Western blot assessed protein
  levels.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 and  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001. Depletion of KRT80 hinders xenograft tumorigenesis
  of NSCLC.
