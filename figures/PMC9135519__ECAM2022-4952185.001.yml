caption: Chromobox homologue 7 (CBX7) was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
  and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). (a) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  in LUAD were show in a volcano plot based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database
  (https://www.cancer.gov/). (b) CBX7 expression in LUAD tissues and normal tissues
  was analyzed by the UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html). (c) CBX7
  expression in LUAD tissues of different clinicopathological stages was analyzed
  by the UALCAN. (d) Overall survival of LUAD patients with low and high CBX7 expression
  was analyzed by GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). (e) CBX7 expression in LUSC
  tissues and normal tissues was analyzed by the UALCAN. (f) CBX7 expression in 6
  tissues of different clinicopathological stages was analyzed by the UALCAN. (g)
  Relative mRNA expression of CBX7 in HPAEpiC, SK-MES-1, and A549 cells was measured
  by qRT-PCR. (h) Relative protein level of CBX7 in HPAEpiC, SK-MES-1, and A549 cells
  was measured by Western blotting. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. HPAEpiC.
