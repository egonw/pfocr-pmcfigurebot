caption: PTCL-EBV demonstrates NFκB transcriptional target gene upregulation and PD-L1
  (CD274) expression associates with immune pathway activation across all three diseases.
  (A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing PTCL-EBV to ENKTL (EBVvsENKTL)
  and PTCL-NOS (EBVvsNOS) across five sets of NFκB transcriptional target genes. Genes
  were ranked by their relative expression differences in EBVvsENKTL and EBVvsNOS
  then submitted to GSEA. All enrichment scores were positive indicating target gene
  upregulation in PTCL-EBV compared to ENKTL and PTCL-NOS. The vertical dashed line
  represents a 0.05 P value threshold. Correlation of PD-L1 (CD274) expression with
  (B) IFNγ, (C) the IL6_JAK_STAT pathway and (D) NFκB target gene expression across
  all three diseases. Our results showed that expression of IFNγ and IL6_JAK_STAT
  genes (median) correlated with PD-L1 gene expression. Taking the union of the five
  aforementioned gene sets, there was also a positive correlation between NFκB transcriptional
  target gene expression (median) and PD-L1 expression. Correlations were assessed
  using the Spearman method. Rho and P values are shown. (E) Possible model of PTCL-EBV
  pathogenesis involving the activation of the NFκB pathway and upregulation of PD-L1,
  BIRC3, and CD27. BIRC3 plays key roles in the regulation of NFκB signaling and apoptosis.
  CD27 contributes to anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte response in the host,
  T-cell exhaustion, compromise in antitumor immunity. In addition, EBV LMP1 and upregulation
  of IFNγ and IL6_JAK_STAT3 could also contribute to PDL1 overexpression in PTCL-EBV.
  Activation of these signaling pathways eventually contributes to inflammation, T-cell
  and immune activation, thereby promoting proliferation and survival, metastasis,
  immune evasion and oncogenesis. Some of these genes and signaling pathways may serve
  as potential therapeutic targets for PTCL-EBV and are indicated in red boxes. Dotted
  lines indicate hypothetical postulations which have not been experimentally validated
  in PTCL-EBV. Figure created with BioRender.com.
