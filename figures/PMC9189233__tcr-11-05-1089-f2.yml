caption: The effects of EGFR and AKT1 expression in HelaCD73 and SiHaCD73 cells proliferation.
  (A,B) Expression levels of EGFR and AKT1 were increased in HelaCD73 and SiHaCD73
  cells. (C) In compared with HelaCD73 transplanted tumor tissues, the expression
  levels of EGFR and AKT1 were increased in HelaCD73 transplanted tumor tissues. (D,E)
  The mRNA expression levels of EGFR and AKT1 were decreased in HelaCD73/SiHaCD73
  cells by transfection of si-EGFR and si-AKT1. (F) The protein expression levels
  of EGFR and AKT1 were decreased in HelaCD73/SihaCD73 cells by transfection of si-EGFR
  and si-AKT1. (G,H) Knockdown of EGFR (EGFRKD) and AKT1 (AKT1KD) inhibited HelaCD73
  and SiHaCD73 cells proliferation. *, P<0.05.
