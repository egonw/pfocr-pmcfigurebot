figure_title: Epitranscriptomic profile of RNA with altered N6-methyladenosine quantity
  in response to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure
caption: (A) Venn diagram showing the overlap between the microarray and RNA sequencing
  data of significantly dysregulated genes with p ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ ± 1. (B) The
  correlation matrix of transcripts with a significant difference in gene expression
  detected by RNA sequencing and N6-methyladenosine abundance was determined by comparing
  with Log2FC. (C) The resulting 170 transcripts that experienced epitranscriptomic
  cis-regulatory outcomes were then isolated from the combined datasets and used for
  downstream pathway analysis using the WikiPathway database and (D) the Gene Ontology
  database.
