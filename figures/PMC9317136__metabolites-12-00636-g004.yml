caption: Effect of taurine on the transcriptional activity of the TXNIP promoter between
  +174/+218. Caco-2 cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing partial
  promoter regions of TXNIP (+174/+191, +187/+204, +200/+218) and then replaced with
  a medium containing 100 mM of taurine. After 24 h, the cells were subjected to a
  luciferase assay. The results are expressed as relative values, with the control
  value as 1. Each value is the mean ± S.E. (n = 3) and the abc values indicated by
  different characters are significantly different from each other, and the abc values
  indicated by the same characters are not significantly different (Tukey’s test;
  p < 0.05).
