caption: 'Tab inhibits LPS-induced microglia activation through NF-κB pathways. BV2
  cells were treated with Tab (3, 6, and 10 µM) for 4 h followed by the treatment
  with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 1 h. (A) The effect of Tab on the expression of p-p65, p65,
  IκBα, p-IKK, and IKK was detected by Western blot. (B–D) The relative expression
  of p-IKK/IKK, IκBα, and p-p65/p65 in (A). ### p < 0.001 vs. untreated control cells;
  ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. LPS-treated cells.'
