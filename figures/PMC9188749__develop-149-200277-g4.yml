caption: scRNA-seq reveals an Aldh2 metabolic gatekeeper function. (A) Experimental
  design for the scRNA-seq experiment to capture the McSCs in regeneration. (B) UMAPs
  of Tg(crestin:mCherry, mitfa:GFP)-positive cells after clustering, split by drug
  treatment. Mb, melanoblasts; Xanth, xanthophores; Irid, iridophores. (C) UMAPs of
  both DMSO- and CVT-10216-treated cells with colour change from grey (negative) to
  purple based on log2 expression of aldh2.1 and aldh2.2 in pigment lineages compared
  with crestin (neural crest), tfec (melanophore/iridophore progenitors), mitfa (early
  melanoblasts) and dct (late melanoblasts). (D) Proposed relationship of imaged McSCs
  to scRNA-seq clusters, using an example niche from D (scale bar is 20 µm) and UMAP
  coloured by expression intensity of mCherry (magenta) and GFP (green), and cells
  in which both are expressed (white). We predict that crestin+ mitfa-high cells (green
  arrow/box) are represented in clusters 7 and 11, and crestin+ mitfa-low cells (magenta
  arrow/box) are represented in clusters 2, 6 and 12. UMAPs of these clusters (top)
  and their predicted cell cycle phase (bottom) are shown. (E) The proportion of total
  cells within each cluster compared between treatment conditions. The log10 percentage
  difference of numbers of cells in the CVT-10216-treated clusters compared with DMSO
  equivalents was plotted, with asterisks indicating a significant difference in proportions
  (Chi squared test). (F) Dot-plot of pathway analysis showing selection of significantly
  upregulated GO (G), KEGG (K), reactome (R) and literature-based (L) terms in clusters
  2, 6 and 12 compared with 7 and 11, and vice versa. Dot size represents observed/expected
  ratio and colour indicates adjusted P-value (Benjamini–Hochberg test). (G) As in
  F, but showing significant enrichment of pathways in CVT-10216-treated cells relative
  to DMSO from clusters 2, 6 and 12 (crestin+ mitfa-low), clusters 7 and 11 (crestin+
  mitfa-high), and cluster 9 (predicted iridophores). (H) Schematic diagram of de
  novo purine biosynthesis, with genes encoding enzymes significantly upregulated
  in the CVT-10216 dataset from G shown in red.
