caption: 'STAT1 transcriptionally mediates HMGB1 upregulation during RLDC treatment.
  BUMPT cells were transfected with 50 nM STAT1 siRNA1 (siS1-1), siRNA2 (siS1-2),
  or negative control siRNA (siNC), and then subjected to 4 days of RLDC treatment
  or left untreated (Con). For drug intervention, after RLDC treatment, the cells
  were incubated with 50, 75, or 100 μM fludarabine for 17 h. (A) Representative immunoblots
  of HMGB1 and GAPDH (loading control) to verify Stat1-knockdown. (B) Densitometry
  of HMGB1 immunoblots. (C) Representative immunoblots of p-STAT1, STAT1, HMGB1 and
  GAPDH showing the effects of fludarabine. (D) Densitometry of p-STAT1, STAT1, and
  HMGB1 in blots. (E) qRT-PCR analysis of Hmgb1 mRNA. The Hmgb1 mRNA values were normalized
  to GAPDH mRNA and expressed as fold change compared to the control. (F) Predicted
  STAT1 binding site in HMGB1 promoter region using JASPAR database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/).
  (G) ChIP assay of STAT1 binding to HMGB1 promoter sequences. Quantitative data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM. N ≥ 4. * P <0.05 vs. the control group (Con), # P < 0.05
  vs. RLDC/siNC cells or RLDC with 0 μM fludarabine cells.'
