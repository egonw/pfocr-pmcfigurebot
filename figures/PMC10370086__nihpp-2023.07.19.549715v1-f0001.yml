caption: (A) Outline of the small molecule phenotypic screen.(B) Cell death modulation
  z-scores for HT-1080N cells pretreated ± nutlin-3 (10 μM, 48 h) then treated ± 261
  bioactive compounds (5 μM). The screen was repeated three times and z-scored mean
  values are shown. Compounds of interest are highlighted.(C) Cell death measured
  by imaging following pretreatment.(D) Outline of the CDK-Rb-E2F cell cycle pathway
  and associated inhibitors.(E) Protein abundance determined by immunoblotting. Blots
  are representative of three experiments.(F) Relative mRNA expression determined
  by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis.
  Individual datapoints from independent experiments are shown.(G) Cell cycle phase
  determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. Nutlin-3 was used
  at 10 μM and palbociclib at 2 μM.(H) Cell death measured by imaging following pretreatment.
  Dox, doxycycline.(I) Cell cycle phase determined by PI staining and flow cytometry.
  Dox was used at 0.1 μg/mL, palbociclib (Palbo) at 2 μM.(J) Protein abundance determined
  by immunoblotting. Blot is representative of three experiments.(K) Cell cycle phase
  determined by PI staining and flow cytometry in stable cell lines expressing the
  indicated constructs.(L) Cell death measured by imaging in stable cell lines expressing
  the indicated constructs.Data in (C), (G-I), (K) and (L) represent mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments.
