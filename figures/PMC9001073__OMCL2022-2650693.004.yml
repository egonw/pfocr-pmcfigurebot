caption: 'ISO suppressed the TLR4-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in diabetic CIRI. (a)
  Diagram of the protocol of the ISO. (b) Left, TTC-stained slices from the sham,
  MCAO ISO(−), MCAO ISO(+), and MCAO TAK-242 groups in DM mice. Right, the ipsilateral
  infarct volume of each group (n = 6). (c) The bar graph shows the neurological scores
  (n = 6 − 10). (d) Left, western blot images of TLR4 and MyD88 (n = 3 in each group).
  Bar graphs showing TLR4 (middle) and MyD88 (right) expression (n = 6). (e) Top,
  representative immunohistochemical images of TLR4 staining in the ischaemic penumbra
  (large picture scale bar: 800 μm, magnification: 50x, small picture scale bar: 100 μm,
  magnification: 400x). Arrows, TLR4-positive cells. Bottom, bar graphs showing the
  total number (left) and the ratio of TLR4-positive cells (right, n = 5). (f) Representative
  immunofluorescence images that microglia expressed TLR4 (scale bar: 100 μm, magnification:
  200x). Arrows, IBA-1 and TLR4 copositive cells. (g) Top, western blot image of p-NF-κB
  p65, NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins (n = 3). Middle, the expression of p-NF-κB
  p65 (left) and NLRP3 (right) expression. Bottom, bar graphs showing caspase-1 (left)
  and IL-1β (right) expression (n = 6). (h) Top, western blot image of autophagy-related
  proteins (n = 3). Middle, the expression of LC3B (left) and p62 (right). Bottom,
  the expression of Beclin-1 (n = 6). ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
