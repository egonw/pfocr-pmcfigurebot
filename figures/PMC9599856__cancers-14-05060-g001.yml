caption: 'Serine synthesis pathway enzymes are expressed in human colorectal cancers.
  (A) PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH mRNA expression levels of GTEx normal tissues were compared
  to mRNA expression profile of CRC tumor tissues out of the TCGA database (RSEM values).
  (B) Kaplan–Meier curves showing overall survival in PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH low/high
  mRNA-expressing rectum cancer patients out of the TCGA database. (C) Representative
  Western blots of PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH with β-actin as loading control in HCT116
  and DLD-1 cells under normoxic conditions. (D) Relative expression of PHGDH, PSAT1
  and PSPH normalized to β-actin in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells under normoxic conditions.
  Data are shown from at least three replicates as mean ± SEM. Unpaired t-test with
  Mann–Whitney test was used for statistical analysis: *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.'
