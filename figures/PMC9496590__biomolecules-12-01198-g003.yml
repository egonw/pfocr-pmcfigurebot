caption: A schematic representation of anti-PD-1 (programmed death-1 pathway) (aPD1)
  delivery via microneedle patch loaded with nanoparticles. The glucose oxidase/catalase
  (GOx/CAT) enzymatic system was immobilized inside the nanoparticles, which resulted
  in the conversion of blood glucose to gluconic acid, resulting in the dissociation
  of nanoparticles, subsequently leading to the release of aPD1. Reproduced from Wang
  et al. [], Open Access.
