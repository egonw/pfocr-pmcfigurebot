caption: The comparisons of somatic mutation characteristics and mutation types among
  colorectal cancer patients with different tumor anatomic locations and genetic interaction
  analysis of different tumor anatomic locations. (A, B) The bar plots comparing somatic
  mutation and pathway alteration rates among patients with different tumor anatomic
  locations (right-sided colon, N=31; left-sided colon, N=36; rectal, N=66). (C) The
  box plots comparing differences in mutation types among patients with different
  tumor anatomic locations (right-sided colon, N=31; left-sided colon, N=36; rectal,
  N=66). (D-F) Genetic interaction analysis of different tumor anatomic locations.
