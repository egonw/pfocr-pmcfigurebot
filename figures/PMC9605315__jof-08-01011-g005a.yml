caption: (a) Pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative phase), (b) glutathione metabolism,
  (c) AdoMet synthesis, and (d) a combination of ABC. The green color indicates the
  genes that are related to the oxidative phase in the pentose phosphate pathway,
  the red color indicates the genes that are related to AdoMet synthesis, and the
  yellow color indicates the genes that are related to glutathione metabolism.
