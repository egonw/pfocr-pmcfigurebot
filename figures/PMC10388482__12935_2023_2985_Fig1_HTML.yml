caption: Upregulated SALL4 in STAD promotes tumor progression and indicates a poor
  prognosis, according to the TCGA database. A, B Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall
  survival in STAD patients based on SALL4 expression; C Overall survival analysis
  for the overall survival of STAD patients via Kaplan-Meier plotter. Data were acquired
  from the TCGA dataset via https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov, https://www.cbioportal.org/,
  and http://kmplot.com/analysis/ database and analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics 23
  software. Spearman correlation analysis of SALL4 mRNA expression with the transcripts
  of angiogenesis-associated genes. D-F Scatter plots depicting the significant correlation
  between SALL4 expression and the mRNA levels of VEGF-A (D), VEGF-B (E), and VEGF-C
  (F) mRNA expression levels in 367 STAD patients from the TCGA database. Data were
  acquired from the TCGA dataset via the https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov database and
  analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software. The results are presented as the means ± standard
  error of mean (SEM). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
