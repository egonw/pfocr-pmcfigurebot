figure_title: Global phosphoproteomics analysis of network-wide signaling effects
  of talazoparib and adavosertib alone and combination
caption: '(A) Volcano plots indicating alteration of phosphorylation signals in H69
  cells upon treatment with talazoparib (50 nM; blue), adavosertib (1 μM; orange)
  alone or in combination (purple) at 3 hrs (top) and 24 hrs (bottom).(B) Combined
  KeGG (K) and Biocarta (B) pathway analysis of phosphoproteomics data from talazoparib,
  adavosertib and drug combination treatments at 3 hrs (open circles) and 24 hrs (solid
  circles). NER: nucleotide excision repair; HR: homologous recombination.(C) Effects
  of talazoparib, adavosertib and their combination on a subnetwork of cell cycle
  and DNA damage response signaling. Individual proteins (rounded rectangles) and
  significantly modulated phosphosites (red circles) are depicted. Drug-induced changes
  for select phosphosites are color-coded according to drug treatment. Solid lines
  indicate direct, dashed lines indirect interactions. Direct drug targets are highlighted
  in blue (talazoparib) and orange (adavosertib).'
