caption: Results of functional enrichment analysis. (A) The GO function enrichment
  bar chart of differentially expressed genes. The ordinate represents the enriched
  GO Term, the bar length represents the number of differentially expressed genes
  enriched in the GO Term. (B) Bars of KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially expressed
  genes. The ordinate indicates the enrichment of KEGG Pathway, the bar length indicates
  the number of Pathway genes. (C) Heat map of enrichment of TOP20 differential pathways
  in high and low risk groups. Each small square represents the ssGSEA score of each
  sample, and the color represents the size of ssGSEA score. The larger the square,
  the darker the color. Red indicates a high ssGSEA score and blue indicates a low
  ssGSEA score.
