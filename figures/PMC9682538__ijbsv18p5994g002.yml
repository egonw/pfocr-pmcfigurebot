caption: M2 macrophages contact activates NOTCH signaling in PCa cells. (A-C) RNA-sequence
  data of M2 macrophage contact (experimental group) and noncontact (control group).
  A, Gene cluster analysis of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc. B, KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc showed that M2 macrophage direct contact increased NOTCH
  signaling pathway enrichment. C, GSEA showed that direct M2 macrophage contact promoted
  NOTCH-related gene enrichment. (D) Western blot assay of NOTCH signaling-related
  protein expression. M2 macrophages (THP-1 and PBMC-derived) in direct contact increased
  N1ICD, HES1, and HEY1 expression in DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared with
  that in the noncontact and control groups.
