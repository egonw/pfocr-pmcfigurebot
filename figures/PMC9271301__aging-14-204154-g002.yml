caption: Expression profiles of TRPM7 in HNSCC-derived cell lines and HNSCC tumor
  samples as well as knockdown of TRPM7/NFAT expression via shRNA. (A) Immunoblotting
  analysis of TRPM7 in HNSCC-derived cell lines and NHOKs, quantification of TRPM7
  mRNA expression in HNSCC-derived cell lines through qRT-PCR, and target expression
  screening strategy for head and neck cancer cell lines. (B) qRT-PCR and protein
  analysis of SAS cells with TRPM7 knockdown and control cells in the TRPM7/NFAT axis.
  Knocking down of TRPM7 downregulated the expression of genes and proteins related
  to TRPM7 and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway (NFATC3, NOTCH1), which implies that TRPM7
  and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway may have a regulatory relationship, as well as
  representative images of the SAS cell colony and sphere (C, D). (E) Bar graph shows
  the mean Â± standard deviation of the percentage of migrating and invasive SAS cells
  treated with shNC or shTRPM7 over three independent experiments. (F) Western blot
  analysis results showed target of TRPM7 that may affect invasion and migration pathway
  of HNSCC by evaluating modulation of several EMT markers. (G) Analysis of the relationships
  of TRPM7 with E-caderin and vimentin. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
