caption: Crocodylus porosus serum-induced differentially expressed targets genes in
  breast cancer cells. (A). Relative mRNA expression of 51 differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in breast cancer cells treated with crocodile serum versus the control
  untreated cells. All plotted genes were statistically significant in comparison
  to the control. (B). Pathway enrichment analysis using DEGs as input genes. (C).
  Heatmap showing expression of DEGs in normal human breast tissues from GTEx. (D).
  Diagram showing protein-protein interactions amongst the DEGs encoded proteins.
