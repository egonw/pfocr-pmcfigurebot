figure_title: Inhibition GCN5 activity reduces binding of TAB1 and TAK1 and blocks
  TAK1 activation
caption: 'A Western blots showing the activity of TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway components
  in NRCMs infected with AdNull or AdGCN5 for 24 h, under treatment with PE and DMSO
  or iTAK1. B Effects of iTAK1 on cardiomyocyte surface areas in NRCMs infected with
  AdNull or AdGCN5 under PE treatment. C Effects of iTAK1 on hypertrophic marker genes
  in NRCMs infected with AdNull or AdGCN5 for 24 h under PE treatment (n.s., ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs AdNull DMSO PE; n.s., ##P < 0.01 vs AdGCN5 DMSO PE; n.s. vs AdGCN5 iTAK1 PE).
  D Effects of GCN5 inhibitor MB3 on binding of TAK1 with TAB1 and TAB2 in NRCMs under
  PE treatment. E Schematic diagram showing how GCN5 regulates cardiac hypertrophy.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.'
