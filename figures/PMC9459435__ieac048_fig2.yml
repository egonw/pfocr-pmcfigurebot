caption: Phenotype of the DDC mutation with abnormal pigmentation induced by sgRNA
  and Cas9 injection in H. axyridis. (A) Anterior view of the wild type (WT) and mutant
  type (MT) at second day of first, second, third, and fourth instar larvae. Bar =
  1,000 μm. (B) Anterior view of the wild type (WT) and mutant type (MT) on pre-pupae
  and the second day of pupae. Bar = 1,000 μm. (C) Anterior view of the wild type
  (WT) and mutant type (MT) at second day of adult (f. conspicua and f. succinea).
  Bar = 1,000 μm. The mutant ladybird beetles were abnormal that melanin missing in
  body wall and body length was decreased compared with control.
