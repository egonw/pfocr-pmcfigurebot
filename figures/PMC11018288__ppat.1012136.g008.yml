figure_title: ASFV pB318L interacts with IFNAR1/2 to inhibit IFN signaling pathway
caption: (A) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing pB318L and
  STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, together with ISG56-luciferase and Renilla-TK, at 24 hpt the
  cells were collected to analyze the luciferase activity. (B) HEK293T cells were
  transfected with a plasmid expressing Flag-pB318L, along with a plasmid expressing
  HA-tagged IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, respectively. At 24
  hpt, Co-IP was performed to detect the interaction between pB318L and molecules
  in the IFNAR-JAK-STAT signaling pathway. (C-D) Co-IP analysis of the interaction
  between pB318L and endogenous IFNAR1/IFNAR2 in PAMs that were mock infected or infected
  with ASFV or ASFV-intB318L. (E) CRL-2843 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing
  Flag-IFNAR1 or Flag-IFNAR2 and GFP-pB318L. At 24 hpt, the localizations of pB318L,
  IFNAR1, and IFNAR2 were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Scale bars, 20
  μm. (F) Pearson correlation coefficient between pB318L and IFNAR1/2. (G) HEK293T
  cells were co-transfected with different plasmids expressing HA-pB318L, HA-TYK2,
  and Flag-IFNAR1 as indicated. Co-IP was performed to detect the interactions among
  IFNAR1, TYK2 and pB318L. (H) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing
  HA-pB318L, HA-JAK1, and Flag-IFNAR2 as indicated. Co-IP was performed to detect
  the interactions among IFNAR2, JAK1, and pB318L. Data are representative of three
  independent experiments with three biological replicates (mean ± s.d.). *** p <
  0.001, (one-way ANOVA).
