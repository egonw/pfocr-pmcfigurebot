caption: Biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. The top five enriched terms
  of (A) BP, (B) MF, and (C) KEGG are displayed along with the corresponding p-values
  in a bar graph. Those with significant p-values (i.e., <0.05) are matched with the
  colored bars. A p-value (shown with *) shows the significant adjusted p-value (<0.05).
