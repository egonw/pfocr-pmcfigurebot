caption: Prophylactic treatment of PTUPB disrupts the TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway
  in AECs. Cells were treated with PTUPB (1 μM) for 1 h before the treatment with
  TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL). Thirty minutes after the TGF-β1 administration, the levels of
  p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 in A549 cells ((a–c) n = 3) and MLE12 cells ((d–f) n = 3) were
  detected by western blotting. Forty-eight hours after the TGF-β1 administration,
  the fluorescence intensity of Smad2 and Smad3 was detected by immunofluorescence
  ((g) bar = 25 μm). Twelve hours after the TGF-β1 administration, the mRNA expressions
  of ZEB1 and SNAIL1 in A549 cells were detected by real-time PCR ((h–i) n = 3). The
  data shown are from a representative experiment with biological triplicates. Data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD. Differences among multiple groups were performed
  using ANOVA. Tukey's test was used as a post hoc test to make pairwise comparisons.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
