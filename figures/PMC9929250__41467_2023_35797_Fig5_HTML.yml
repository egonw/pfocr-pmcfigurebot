figure_title: DGC and IGC subtypes based on TF activity profiles
caption: a The association of TF activity-based subtypes with clinical outcomes in
  DGC and IGC. n (DGC cluster 1) = 38, n (DGC cluster 2) = 45, n (IGC cluster 1) = 40,
  and n (IGC cluster 2) = 62 biologically independent samples. P-values are from Log-rank
  test. b Clinical characteristics annotation in GC TF activity-based subtypes. c
  Master TFs selection in each TF activity-based subtype. d Pathway enrichment analysis
  of master TFs regulated TGs in each TF activity-based subtype. e A list of TGs regulated
  by master TFs in significantly altered pathways and their abundance in each DGC
  TF activity-based subtype. f A list of TGs regulated by master TFs in significantly
  altered pathways and their abundance in each IGC TF activity-based subtype. g Expression
  of phospho-sites in each TF activity-based subtype. The p-values are from Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test. Red and orange colors, upregulated phospho-sites in DGC cluster 2
  and IGC cluster 2, respectively. h Spearman’s correlation coefficients between kinases
  and phospho-sites upregulated in DGC cluster 2 and IGC cluster 2. i Phospho-regulatory
  network in GC. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
