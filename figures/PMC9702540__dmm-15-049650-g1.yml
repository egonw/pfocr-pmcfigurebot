caption: 'Elevated lipogenic gene expression in Cdk8 null mutants. (A) Model: the
  role of Cdk8 and other protein kinases in mediating the dietary effects of carbohydrates
  and amino acids on SREBP and lipogenesis through the insulin/mTOR signaling pathway
  (also see Results and Discussion sections for details). (B) Dot plot of the top
  40 Gene Ontology categories of significantly altered genes in Cdk8K185 mutant larvae
  compared with the control (w1118) larvae at the third-instar wandering stage. (C)
  Heatmap of genes involved in the fatty acid biosynthetic process category of triplicate
  samples of w1118 (control) and Cdk8K185 mutant larvae at the third-instar wandering
  stage.'
