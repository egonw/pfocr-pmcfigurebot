caption: 'ucOCN inhibits the phosphorylation of TNF-α-mediated transcription factors.
  (A) C2C12 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α and/or 0.5 ng/mL ucOCN for 1, 10
  and 30 minutes. The extracted whole lysate was subjected to Western blot and analyzed
  using anti-p65 NF-κB antibody or anti-phospho-p65 NF-κB antibody. (B) Quantification
  of the Western blot bands. (C) C2C12 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α and/or
  0.5 ng/mL ucOCN. After 3 and 30 minutes, cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction lysates
  were extracted, and the expression of each antibody was analyzed using Western blot.
  (D) Quantification of the Western blot bands. (E) HEK 293 cells were transfected
  with pGL3 (control vector) or p65 NF-κB expression plasmids. After 24 hours, cells
  were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α and/or 0.5, 5, and 50 ng/mL ucOCN for 15 minutes.
  Subsequently, luciferase activity was measured. The resulting value is presented
  as firefly luciferase activity in comparison to the activity of Renilla. *P < 0.05
  compared to p65 NF-κB-luc without TNF-α/ucOCN groups; #P < 0.05 compared to p65
  NF-κB-luc with TNF-α groups.'
