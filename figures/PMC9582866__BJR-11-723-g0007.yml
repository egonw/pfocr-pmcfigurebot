caption: 'Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway was involved
  in p67phox-induced chondrocyte differentiation. a) The relationship between the
  ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway and p67phox was also measured in chondrocytes by western
  blot analysis. β-actin served as protein loading control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 compared to transfected pcDNA alone. b) Later passage of chondrocytes
  were transiently transfected with various doses of p67phox plasmid (pcDNA-p67phox)
  or control (pcDNA3.1). p67phox-overexpressed cells were pretreated with either 5
  or 10 μmol/l of LY294002 for three hours, and then the expression of collagen, type
  II, alpha 1 (COL2A1) and aggrecan (ACAN) protein was measured by western blot analysis.
  Each assay was performed in triplicate, and the results shown as means (standard
  deviations (SDs)) of four independent experiments (p < 0.001). c) The pcp67phox
  plasmids (1 μg) were used to cotransfect chondrocytes with pLKO.1-AKT1-shRNA (1
  or 2 μg) for 24 hours, and the cell lysates were harvested to determine p67, p-AKTS473,
  COL2A1, ACAN, and β-ACTIN expression. ###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01 compared to transfected
  pcDNA alone; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to transfected with wild
  type of pcp67 plasmid. shRNA, short hairpin (sh) RNA.'
