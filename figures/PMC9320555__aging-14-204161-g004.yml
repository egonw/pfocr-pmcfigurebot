caption: Effects of BDDD-721 on the hedgehog pathway in medulloblastoma cells. (A)
  Gli activity was detected by Gli-luciferase reporter assay in medulloblastoma cells
  treated with curcumin or BDDD-721. (B) The expression of Shh protein was analyzed
  by western blot in DAOY and ONS-76 cells treated with BDDD-721 for 48h. (C) Proteins
  of Smo, GLI1 and Ptch1 were examined by western blot in DAOY and ONS-76 cells treated
  with BDDD-721 for 48h. (D) Proteins of N-myc, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 were quantified
  by western blot in DAOY and ONS-76 cells treated with BDDD-721 for 48h.
article_title: Curcumin analogue BDDD-721 exhibits more potent anticancer effects
  than curcumin on medulloblastoma by targeting Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway.
