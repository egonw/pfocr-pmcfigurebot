caption: Effect of adrenergic agonists on the invasive capacity of Hep3B and MDA-MB-231
  cells. (A–D) Hep3B human HCC cells (A,C) and MDA-MB-231 human BC cells (B,D) suspended
  in serum-free media were seeded onto the inserts of transwell plates and treated
  with either E or NE or ISO at 0.1–10 μM. The inner membrane of the insert was coated
  with Matrigel. Medium containing 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant.
  After 24 h of incubation, the invaded cells were stained and photographed (×100
  magnification). (A,B) Representative images from triplicate analyses are shown.
  (C,D) Relative invasion was calculated by counting the stained cells. The data are
  expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Significance was determined
  by the Student’s t-test (ns, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
  vs. untreated controls). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; BC, breast cancer; E, epinephrine;
  NE, norepinephrine.
