caption: PFWE inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  in A549 cells. The cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and treated with or
  without different doses of PFWE for 6 h The RNA expression of (a) IL-6 and (b) IL-8
  was examined by q-PCR (n = 8 in each group). The levels of (c) IL-6, (d) IL-8, (e)
  CCL2/MCP-1, and (f) CXCL1/GROα in the supernatants of A549 cells stimulated with
  LPS for 24 h were determined (n = 12 in each group). The data are presented as mean ± SEM
  (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001) compared with the LPS-stimulated group
  and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Kruskal–Wallis
  test.
