caption: Effect of BRHE on phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cell line. RAW 264.7 cells were
  treated with 200, 100, 50, and 25 μg/mL of BRHE or 0.5 μg/mL of LPS in the presence
  of K12 particles. (A) Phagocytosis of K12 particle was analyzed by FACS. (1) vehicle
  only (control); (2) K12 particle; (3) K12+0.5 μg/mL LPS, (4) K12 –BRHE 200 μg/mL;
  (5) K12-100 μg/mL BRHE; (6) K12-50 μg/mL BRHE; (7) K12-25 μg/mL BRHE. (B) Statistical
  analysis of the percentage of the cells engulfed K-12 particles. (C) Images of cell-engulfed
  K-2 particles by fluorescence microscopy with 100× magnification. Data are shown
  as the means ± SD of three replicates (n = 3). ** p < 0.01, compared to the control
  group.
