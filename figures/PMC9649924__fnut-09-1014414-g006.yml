caption: Transcriptome analysis of NCI-H1975 cells between the control group and CLS-treated
  group. (A) Volcano plot with 1,077 DEGs up-regulated and 1,008 DEGs down-regulated.
  (B) GO enrichment analysis of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs. (C) KEGG enrichment
  analysis of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs. (D) The expression heatmap of
  22 DEGs related to Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and Rheumatoid arthritis
  signaling pathway in each sequencing sample. (E) The expression heatmap of 23 DEGs
  related to PIK-Akt signaling pathway in each sequencing sample. (F) The expression
  heatmap of 16 DEGs related to MAPK signaling pathway in each sequencing sample.
  (H,I) Interaction relationships of DEGs on four signaling pathways, including TGF-Î²
  signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, PIK-Akt signaling pathway and MAPK signaling
  pathway.
