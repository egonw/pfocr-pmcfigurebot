caption: High expression of ACE2 is associated with drug resistance in breast cancer
  patients. A The ACE2 expression profiles of breast cancer samples and normal tissues
  in the TCGA-BRCA and GTEx database. (Dot plot) Each dot represents the expression
  of a sample (*P < 0.05). B Western blot analysis showed the expression of ACE2 protein
  in normal breast cell line (MCF-10A) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-468, MDA-231,
  T47D, MCF-7, BT-549, SK-BR-3, BT-474). The number below every lane represents the
  ratio of ACE2/β-actin expression in the Western blot assays. C Expression levels
  of ACE2 gene in breast cancer, colon colorectal cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer
  and pancreatic cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE).
  The vertical axis in the figure represents ACE2 expression, the horizontal axis
  is the cell lines, and the different colors represent the group of cell lines. D ACE2
  expression levels in the plasma of all breast cancer patients (n = 111) and healthy
  controls (n = 20) were measured by ELISA (P = 4.7e−12). E The plasma levels of ACE2
  in chemosensitive and insensitive breast cancer patients (P = 3.9e-06). (F) Comparison
  of ACE2 expression levels in breast cancer patients receiving and not receiving
  chemotherapy in METABRIC (***P < 0.001) and (G) TCGA-BRCA database (****P < 0.0001)
