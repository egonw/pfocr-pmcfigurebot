caption: Heat map visualization of the scored in situ expression analyses of mTOR
  and metabolic pathway markers in papillary (PRCC) and clear cell renal cell carcinomas
  (CCRCC). Immunohistochemical expression of the markers was visualized on a heat
  map in each case. Blue color indicates low expression, whereas red color indicates
  high expression. Missing values are shown in grey. The pT stage and nuclear grade
  are also available.
