caption: Frequency modulation of RTG pathway(A) Multiplex processing of RTG signaling.
  The multiplexed signals from two individual mitochondria are low-pass filtered and
  delayed with respect to the frequency. The two inputs are set at 0.05 rad/s (source
  A) and 0.5 rad/s (source B) with the same phase. The overall effect on Rtg2p activation
  is summed with equal weights, and the combined signal is further modulated by the
  RTG pathway and detected by nucleus Rtg1/3p as the output.(B) Frequency response
  to mitochondrial damage, Rtg3p as an example. (Left) Gain plot. Low-pass filtering
  is observed by screening the input frequency from  to 1 Hz with sinusoidal wave.
  The gain of nucleus Rtg3p is defined as the ratio of output to input amplitude measured
  by the peak-to-peak distance. (Middle) Phase plot. The delay of output is increased
  by the input frequency. With the time deviation between the peaks of output and
  input, the delayed Rtg3p signal is described by degrees in respect of the input
  frequency. (Right) The Nyquist plot, combined with the gain and phase plot, reveals
  the closed-loop stability of the proposed model. The radius represents the gain
  (dB), and the angle labels the degree of phase. The red dot represents the critical
  point . The proposed model is stable if the Nyquist curve excludes the critical
  point.
