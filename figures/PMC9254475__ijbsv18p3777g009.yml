caption: LncRNA HOXA10-AS promotes the migration and proliferation of pancreatic cancer
  cells in vitro. a-d Representative images of wound healing assay for two cell lines
  transfected with corelated plasmids. b and d revealed quantification of the data
  shown in a and c. e-f Representative images of colony formation assay for PANC-1
  and CFPAC-1. g-h Representative images of the migration ability of PANC-1 and CFPAC-1
  by Transwell assay. Each experiment was performed three times independently and
  results are presented as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was used to analyze the data.
