caption: Correlation analysis of gene expression profiles. The raw R2, KEGG Tanimoto
  coefficient and deep R2 were used to represent the correlations of the raw gene
  expression values, KEGG pathway level features and graph embedding, respectively.
  NR3C1_96_PC3 means the gene NR3C1 knockdown profiles was selected with a duration
  of 96 h in the PC3 cell line
