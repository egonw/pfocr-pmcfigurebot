caption: Proteostasis perturbations may arise at any stage of the protein life cycle
  and typically result in the initiation of sterile inflammation. Depicted are three
  pathological situations causing impaired proteostasis in which translation (1),
  protein folding (2) and proteasome-mediated protein degradation of defective ribosomal
  products (DRiPs) following their polyubiquitination by E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of
  the ubiquitin-conjugation pathway (3) are affected.
