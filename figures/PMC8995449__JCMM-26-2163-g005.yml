caption: Nur77 inhibits the activation of NF‐κB by upregulating IκB‐α expression during
  osteoclast differentiation. (A) The protein levels of IκB‐α. (B) The protein levels
  of NF‐κB and p‐NF‐κB. (C‐H) The mRNA levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, Ctsk, Car2, ACP5 and
  NFATC1. (I) TRAP staining image of osteoclast differentiation cultures. Multinucleated
  TRAP+ (red) cells were identified as mature osteoclasts on day 5. (J). Osteoclast
  numbers. All data are presented as boxplots with median and interquartile range
  and were statistically assessed by one‐way analysis followed by the Bonferroni test.
