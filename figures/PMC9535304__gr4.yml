caption: Cannabidiol (CBD)-modulated proteins in the Nrf2 - NF-κB (p65 and p62) crosstalk.
  Nrf2 and p65 can negatively affect each other's transcriptional activities by decreasing
  their interactions with CBP/p300. On the other hand, Keap1 can interact with IκBβ
  and promote its proteasomal degradation. Moreover, p62, can promote Nrf2 activation
  and also NF-κB activity by stimulation of TRAF6, PKCζ, RIP1 and IKKγ. (the dark
  green or soft-green arrows are used for CBD-mediated increase or decrease in the
  level of proteins, respectively; the black or end-cut arrows are used for up-regulation
  and down-regulation of activity; glycogen synthase kinase-3, GSK3; CREB-binding
  protein (CBP); histone deacetylase-3, HDAC3; inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B
  -α and –β, IκBα and IκBβ; G protein-coupled receptor 55, GPR55; IκB kinase complex,
  IKK; NF-κB - essential modulator, NEMO; small GTP-binding protein, Rac1; heme oxygenase-1,
  HMOX1; TNF-α receptor-associated factor 6, TRAF6; protein kinase C-zeta, PKCζ; receptor-interacting
  protein, RIP1; reactive oxygen species, ROS)A. Regulatory feedback loop between
  p62 and Nrf2 B. The antagonistic effect between Nrf2 and p65. (For interpretation
