  in ApoE-/- mice
caption: '(A) Representative images of immunohistochemistry staining of aortic roots
  (scale bar: 100 μm). (B) Representative images of TUNEL (green) and caspase-1 p10
  (red) immunofluorescence staining of aortic roots (scale bar: 100 μm).(C-G) Quantification
  analysis of the average optical density in aorta: (C) CTSB, (D) NLRP3, (E) caspase-1
  p10, (F) GSDMD-N, (G) α-SMA. (H) Quantification analysis of TUNEL- and caspase-1
  p10 double-positive cells. Data are presented as means ± SEM. n = 3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, and ****P<0.0001.n = 3, NC: mice fed chow diet; CTRL: mice fed a high-fat
  diet; Mock: empty lentiviral vector + high-fat diet; sh-CTSB: CTSB shRNA + high-fat
  diet; Lv-CTSB: CTSB lentivirus + high-fat diet; HF: high-fat diet; CTSB: cathepsin
