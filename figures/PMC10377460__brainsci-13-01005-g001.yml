caption: 'The pathway for fluid transport can be separated into five distinct sections:
  (1) the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the choroid plexus, potentially
  supplemented by extrachoroidal sources such as capillary influx and metabolic water
  production; (2) the pulsation of arterial walls which drives CSF deep into the brain
  along perivascular spaces; (3) the CSF is carried into the brain parenchyma through
  AQP4 water channels and then dispersed throughout the neuropil; (4) interstitial
  fluid (ISF) and CSF mix, accumulating in the peri-venous space and subsequently
  draining from the brain through (5) meningeal and cervical lymphatic vessels, as
  well as cranial and spinal nerves.'
