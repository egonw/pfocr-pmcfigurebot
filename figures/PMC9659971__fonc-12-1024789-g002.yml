caption: Lactate in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor microenvironment is characterized
  by high lactic acid enrichment. For the classic Warburg effect and the later Reverse
  Warburg effect, only the lactate producing cells are different. The former relies
  on the production of lactic acid by tumor cells themselves, while the latter relies
  on tumor fibroblasts. High concentration of lactic acid will affect various immune
  cells in the microenvironment. First, lactic acid can promote M2-type polarization
  of macrophages through ERK-STAT3 pathway and Gpr132. Secondly, lactic acid can also
  cause macrophages to overexpress VEGF, thus generating more blood vessels conducive
  to EMT of tumors. Finally, lactate-induced macrophages produce high levels of TNF-α,
  which promotes glycolysis of tumor cells, creating a vicious cycle. For Treg, high
  lactic acid promotes its proliferation, and Treg can actively adapt to this environment
  by down-regulating Myc and LDH. NK cells, on the other hand, were completely inhibited,
  including down-regulation of IFN-γ and cytotoxicity, and increased apoptosis.
