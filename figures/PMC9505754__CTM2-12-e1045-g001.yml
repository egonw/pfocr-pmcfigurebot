caption: Transcriptome‐wide studies of NAT10 Knockdown MCF7 cells. (A) Heatmap showing
  expression pattern of genes in MCF7 post transfected with NAT10 siRNA. (B) Scattered
  plot of deferentially genes of siNAT10 vs. siC in RNA‐seq. (C) Volcano plot showing
  positions of differentially upregulated and downregulated genes in MCF7 post transfected
  with NAT10 siRNA. (D) Bubble plot demonstrating the KEGG pathway analysis of MCF7
  post transfected with NAT10 siRNA. (E) Network analysis of fatty acid metabolic
  genes. (F) Validation of the expression levels of fatty acid metabolic genes with
  RT‐PCR. Bars are represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p <
  .001; and ns > .05.
