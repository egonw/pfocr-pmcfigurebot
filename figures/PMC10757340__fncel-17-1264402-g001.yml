caption: 'VEGF activates SFK pathway in microglial cells. N9 microglial cells were
  treated with 50 ng/ml of VEGF (gray shades) for 5, 15, or 30 minutes (min), or not
  treated (control, white), prior to cell lysis and western blotting analysis of signaling
  pathway activation. (A–D) Representative immunoblots of N9 cell lysates using antibodies
  against specific phosphorylated residues or total proteins for MAPK-p38 pathway
  (phosphoMAPK T180/182, MAPK-p38 total), PLCγ (phosphoPLCγ Y783, total PLCγ) and
  Src pathway (phosphoSrc Y416 and total Src). Note that the expression level of the
  phosphorylated form of p55 regulatory subunit of PI3K, indicated by a black arrowhead
  (phosphoPI3K Y199 residue), was compared to the housekeeping protein β-actin (C).
  β-actin expression validated the proper loading of each sample (A–D). (E–H) Expression
  ratios between phosphorylated and total proteins (E,F,H) or actin (G) show that
  VEGF increased SFK activation [(H), one-way ANOVA, p = 0.04886, Dunnett post hoc
  *p < 0.01, n = 5], but did not change MAPK-p38 activation [(E), Kruskal-Wallis,
  p = 0.7271, n = 5] nor PI3K-p55 regulatory subunit phosphorylation [(G), Kruskal-Wallis:
  p = 0.9529, n = 5]. PLCγ activation was decreased after 30 min of VEGF stimulation
  [(F), Kruskal-Wallis: p = 0.0447, Dunn post hoc with Holm’s correction, *p < 0.05,
  n = 5].'
