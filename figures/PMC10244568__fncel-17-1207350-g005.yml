caption: Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treatment alters transcriptomes of
  both resting and active microglia. (A) Differentially expressed genes between C23
  and C25. The top eight genes enriched in C23 are shown in red and in C25 are shown
  in black. (B) Differentially expressed genes between DOCA-salt and Sham conditions
  in C23. Genes for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) term Neuropeptide signaling
  pathway are shown in red and for GO Molecular Function term Volume-sensitive chloride
  channel activity are shown in blue. (C) Differentially expressed genes between DOCA-salt
  and Sham conditions in C25. Genes for GO Molecular Function terms Calcium ion binding
  involved in regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, Netrin receptor activity,
  and Lamin binding are shown in red, blue, and orange, respectively. (D) Percent
  DOCA-salt and Sham contributions of nuclei to the entire dataset, to both microglia
  clusters, to C23_Microglia 1, and to C25_Microglia 2. Deviation from dataset percentages
  determined by Chi-square test, *p < 0.05.
