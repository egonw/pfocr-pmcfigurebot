caption: rhCD82 attenuates TGF-β1-mediated EMT of ARPE-19 cells through downregulation
  of the Smad-dependent signaling pathway. The cells were pretreated with or without
  400 ng/ml rhCD82 for 1 h and additionally incubated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h.
  Subsequently, the protein expression of Smad-dependent signaling molecules (A),
  Smad-independent signaling molecules (B), and integrin-dependent signaling molecules
  (C) was investigated using immunoblot analysis.
