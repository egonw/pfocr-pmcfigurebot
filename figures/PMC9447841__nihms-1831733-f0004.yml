caption: Effects of ATG5-knockdown on the SFN-induced cutdown of LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
  (A) Endogenous ATG5 mRNA and (B) LC3 protein were detected by real-time PCR and
  western blotting 48 h after transfection with 100 pmpl ATG5 siRNA (siATG5) or negative
  control (siCont.) in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Values are the mean±S.E.M. (n=3).
  *P<.05 (two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test). (C, D) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells
  were treated with 10 μM SFN or DMSO (control) for 10 d after transfection with 100
  pmol ATG5 siRNA or negative control. Cells were then fixed, stained with oil red-O
  staining, and analyzed with a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope. Lipid accumulation
  was quantified using the ImageJ imaging software program. Scale bar=50 μm. Values
  are the mean±S.E.M. (n=10). (E) Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10
  μM SFN for DMSO (control) 24 h after transfection with 100 pmol ATG5 siRNA or negative
  control. The culture medium was collected and assayed for NEFA content (mEq/L/mg
  protein). Values are the mean±S.E.M. (n=9–12). *P<.05 (one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman
  post hoc test).
