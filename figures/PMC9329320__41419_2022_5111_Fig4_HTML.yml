figure_title: TME-derived lactate enhances migrative and invasive capacity of normoxic
  CSCs dependent on OXPHOs pathway
caption: 'a Immunoblot analysis of CD133, Nanog, Sox2, HIF-1α, LDHB, and MCT1 in post-sorted
  SW480 cells. Cell hypoxia was induced under physical hypoxic conditions. Loading
  control was assessed by ACTB (i.e. β-actin). Immunoblot analysis of TOM20 in SW480
  normoxic sphere-forming cells infected by LDHB (b) or MCT1 (c) shRNA lentivirus
  or vector. Cells were treated with CM for 24 h, DMEM/F12 medium as control. Loading
  control was assessed by ACTB (i.e. β-actin). d, e Seahorse analysis for oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) of SW480 normoxic sphere-forming cells infected by LDHB shRNA lentivirus
  or vector. Cells were treated with CM for 24 h, DMEM/F12 medium as control. Quantification
  of the Seahorse data was shown in e. f, g Seahorse analysis for oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) of SW480 sphere-forming cells infected by MCT1 shRNA lentivirus or vector.
  Cells were treated with CM for 24 h, DMEM/F12 medium as control. Quantification
  of the Seahorse data was shown in g. h–k Transwell invasion assays. SW480 normoxic
  sphere-forming cells were infected by MCT1 shRNA or LDHB shRNA lentivirus or vector.
  Cells were cultured in CM for 24 h, DMEM/F12 medium as control. Representative images
  were shown in h and i. Quantified analysis was shown in j and k. Scale bar: 200 μm.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. All experiments were repeated three times independently.
