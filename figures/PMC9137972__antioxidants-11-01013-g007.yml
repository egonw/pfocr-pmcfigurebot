caption: Effects of SBH in suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling in H2O2-induced Vero
  cells. Effects of SBH on NF-κB signaling pathway analyzed by (A) Western blot analysis
  and (B) immunofluorescence analysis of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation; (C) Western
  blot analysis of key MAPK signaling molecules. Experiments were carried out in triplicate
  (n = 3) to ensure repeatability.
