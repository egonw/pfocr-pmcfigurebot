caption: 'Gene enrichment analysis for CBX8-related genes. (a) PPI networks of CBX8-related
  proteins. The increase from a small circle to a bigger circle represents an increase
  in the number of genes interacting directly with each other (namely degree). (b)
  GO analysis; (c) KEGG analysis. PPI: protein-protein networks; GO: Gene Ontology;
  KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. Colored images are available
  online.'
