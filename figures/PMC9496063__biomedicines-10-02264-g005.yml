caption: Hub signaling pathways from KEGG enrichment analysis of genes specifically
  expressed in hepatocytes at different stages. Dot plots of KEGG signaling pathways
  (A) and networks of top 10 hub pathways (B) for genes specifically expressed from
  60 to 72 hpf (a and b). Dot plots of KEGG signaling pathways (C) and networks of
  top 10 hub pathways (D) for genes specifically expressed from 72 to 96 hpf (f and
  g). Dot plots of KEGG signaling pathways (E) and networks of top 10 hub pathways
  (F) for genes specifically expressed from 60 to 96 hpf (c, f and g). Node color
  stands for the enrichment p-value in the pathway.
