caption: LIS1 promotes the proliferation and anti-apoptosis of SACC-LM cells. (A and
  D) Cell proliferation was examined via CCK-8 assays in SACC-LM cells transfected
  with (A) LIS1 overexpression plasmid or (D) si-LIS1. (B and E) The proliferation
  of SACC-LM cells was detected by EdU assays at 48 h after transfection with the
  (B) LIS1 overexpression plasmid or (E) si-LIS1. (C and F) Quantitative statistical
  analysis of the EdU assay results. (G) TUNEL assays were performed to assess cell
  apoptosis at 48 h after overexpression or siRNA targeting LIS1 in SACC-LM cells.
  Scale bar, 100 µm. (H) Quantitative statistical analysis of TUNEL assay results.
  Mean ± SEM; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1, lissencephaly 1; SACC, salivary
  gland adenoid cystic carcinoma; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; si-, small interfering
  RNA; EdU, 5′-ethynl-2′-deoxyuridine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
  dUTP nick-end labeling.
