figure_title: Combination therapy with VTP-50469 and LEN results in additive anti-leukemic
  activity in vivo
caption: a, Immunohistochemistry for human CD45 antigen on bone marrow sections (sternum)
  on PDX/CBAM-68552 following 3 weeks treatment with vehicle, LEN 50 mg/kg daily,
  VTP-50469 0.1% rodent diet and the drug combination. b, Analysis of differentiation
  in circulating leukaemia cells using CD11b and CD14 expression assessed by flow
  cytometry in CBAM-68552 after 3 weeks drug treatment. Percentage of double-positive
  cells is indicated. Representative examples from individual mice are shown. c, Assessment
  of apoptosis in human CD45-positive cells from bone marrow of drug-treated mice
  using the CBSK-17D model following 2 weeks drug treatment. The percentage of total
  viable, human cells are indicated. Representative examples from individual mice
  are shown. d, Quantitation of apoptotic cells from bone marrow of mice transplanted
  with the CBSK-17D PDX model following 2 weeks drug treatment. Data represent mean+/−SEM
  with p-value by unpaired two-tail t-test. e, RNA-seq heatmap from PDX/CBAM-68552
  following 3 weeks treatment with vehicle, LEN 50 mg/kg daily, VTP-50469 0.1% rodent
  diet and the drug combination. Heatmap displaying RNA-Seq DESeq2 statistical z-score
  for the co-regulated gene network between VTP-50469 and LEN f, RNA-seq heatmap displaying
  DESeq2 statistical z-score for genes detected in the “granulocyte” pathway as additively
  deregulated using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis. g, Bar code
  plots using the gene set for HOXA9 regulated genes under each drug treatment from
  RNA-seq in vivo using the PDX/CBAM-68552 model. Normalized enrichment score and
  family-wise error rate p-value determined by the GSEA computational method. h, Gene
  set testing for reported MLL-fusion gene targets for LEN and VTP-50469. Family-wise
  p-value and normalized enrichment score (NES) determined by the GSEA computational
  method. i, IPA upstream regulator analysis. Graph displays selected activation z-scores
  for detected pathways with p-value <0.05. j, Measurement of peripheral blood circulating
  human CD45 positive cells from PDX mice transplanted with the DFAM-16835 PDX model
  (NPM1c) after two weeks of drug treatment in vivo. Data represent mean+/−SEM with
  p-value determined using unpaired, two-tail t-test.
