caption: Proposed signalling pathway for the inhibition of migration and invasion.
  The effect of natural compounds likely occurs through the inhibition of FAK, a GTPase
  family that regulates MMP-2/-9 expression through PI3K/Ark pathways, the P38 MAPK
  pathway or the Ras/Raf/Erk signalling pathway to inhibit migration and invasion.
