caption: a) Comparison of different mutual information (MI) estimation strategies
  based on imputation (iMI), depletion (dMI) and hybrid partitioning (hpMI) and the
  MI â€“ Spearman correlation relationship using the CPTAC-S45 dataset. b) Receiver
  operating characteristic of (signal transduction) Data Processing Inequality (stDPI/DPI)
  and unprocessed (noDPI) signaling dependencies as evaluated using a ground truth
  dataset. c) Baseline profiles of six diverse CRC cell lines were acquired and used
  with the GDSC reference database to identify sensitive and resistant or insensitive
  cell lines for each covered drug compound. Using mVESPA and CRC-specific signalons,
  differential comparisons were conducted for each drug compound to identify the top
  differentially active regulators. d) VESPA (red), consisting of mVESPA and dVESPA,
  performs substantially better than mVESPA using context unspecific Pathway Commons
  (blue) SigNets.
