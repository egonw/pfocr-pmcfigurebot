caption: CB rebuilt the structure of gut microbiota. (A) Venn diagrams of bacterial
  OTUs. The y-axis represents the OTU number. (B) Alpha diversity estimation of gut
  microbiota by the Simpson index. (C) Student’s t test for the Simpson index. (D)
  Community bar plot analysis at the phylum level. (E) Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio
  of the 2 groups by Student’s t test. Error bars represent mean ± SD; *P<0.05; ns,
  no significant difference. (F) Community bar plot analysis at the species level.
  (G) Analysis of beta diversity by PCoA. Ctrl, control group; CB, Clostridium butyricum;
  PCoA, principal co-ordinates analysis; OTU, operational taxonomic unit.
article_title: Clostridium butyricum inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer
  and alleviates intestinal inflammation via the myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
