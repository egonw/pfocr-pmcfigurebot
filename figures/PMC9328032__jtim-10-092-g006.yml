caption: '(A) Iron homeostasis and utilization in the body. Dietary iron is absorbed
  in the duodenum and binds to transferrin. Iron is then delivered to the bone marrow
  for erythropoiesis the major utilization pathway. Senescent RBCs are phagocytosed
  by macrophages (erythrophagocytosis) and ca. 90% of iron is recycled for heme synthesis.
  Excess iron is stored in ferritin in the liver. Regulation of iron metabolism by
  hepcidin and factors which influence hepcidin expression is also shown. Black circles
  indicate potential sites of alcohol interference. (B) Heme degradation by HO1. Notably,
  the heme binding respiratory chain-blocker CO is produced and toxic iron is release.
  In addition, bilirubin is ultimately conjugated in the liver and excreted through
  the biliary system. Bilirubin and bile acids can both cause eryptosis and hemolysis
  at higher concentrations. FPN: ferroportin; HFE: hemochromatosis protein; BMP: bone
  morphogenetic protein; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; RBC: red blood cell.'
