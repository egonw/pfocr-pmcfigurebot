caption: The overview of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, and MEK5/ERK5 pathway, with
  their respective small molecule inhibitors. The immune-modulatory effect of both
  PI3K and MAPK inhibition provides a promising option to overcome therapeutic resistance
  with ICIs. Dual-targeted inhibition of MAPK and PI3K pathway effectors in combination
  or with sequential treatment with ICIs may present a potential strategy to overcome
  resistance in patients with tumors harboring both pathway-associated mutations.
  FDA-approved therapeutic agents are denoted in red. Inhibitors with an asterisk
  (*) are approved in melanoma. Created with BioRender.com.
