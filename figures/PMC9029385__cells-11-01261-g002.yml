caption: Possible mechanisms underlying the link between GCase, alpha-synuclein and
  PD. (A) GBA mutations result in misfolded GCase protein, which is retained in the
  ER, not trafficked to the lysosome, and activates ER stress pathways such as the
  UPR. (B) Reduced GCase in the lysosome results in lysosomal dysfunction and subsequent
  impairment of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. This leads to the accumulation of
  lipid substrates, GlcCer and GlcSph, and alpha-synuclein. This accumulation can
  block the trafficking of newly synthesised GCase from the ER/Golgi to the lysosome
  and further exacerbates lysosomal dysfunction. Impaired degradation of alpha-synuclein
  through defective lysosomal and autophagic machinery can also lead to an increase
  in the exosome-mediated release of alpha-synuclein. This mechanism allows alpha-synuclein
  pathology to propagate through the brain. (C) A deficiency in GCase activity at
  the lysosome can lead to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, as well as other
  lipid forms. Aberrant lipid accumulation can affect lipid membrane composition and
  may enhance the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. (D) Defective clearance of mitochondria
  may occur as a consequence of a GCase deficiency and reduced ALP function. This
  can lead to the accumulation of defective mitochondria. A GCase deficiency has also
  been associated with oxidative stress, reduced ATP production and abnormal mitochondrial
  morphology. (E) A GCase deficiency has been linked to neuroinflammation. An accumulation
  of lipids or alpha-synuclein may activate microglia. Alpha-synuclein released into
  the extracellular space may also directly bind and active microglia. Created with
