caption: A scheme to potentiate Pxl + ICI combination therapy. Low Taxane dose induces
  micronucleation and cytosolic exposure of DNA. The following cGAS-STING pathway
  activation leads to release by cancer cells of proinflammatory signals that render
  “hot” the tumor microenvironment and help recruitment of cytotoxic T cells. At the
  same time, however, the cGAS-STING pathway leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 expression
  in cancer cells that inhibits T cell activation. The sequential treatment with ICIs
  unlocks the cancer cell killing potential of T cells.
