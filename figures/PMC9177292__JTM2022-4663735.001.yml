caption: Urinary metabolite profiles reflect characteristics of DENV infections. Score
  plot of principal component analysis (PCA) performed using urinary metabolite data
  for all samples in (a) the positive-ion mode and (b) the negative-ion mode. Score
  plot of partial least squares (PLS) regression performed using metabolite data from
  samples in (c) the positive-ion mode and (d) the negative-ion mode. (e) Metabolite
  cluster heatmap of urine. The metabolites in urine were analysed by hierarchical
  clustering. Each vertical line represents a plasma sample, and rows represent metabolites.
  Urine samples from the same group of mice were aggregated. The relative content
  in the figure is displayed by different colours. The redder the colour is, the higher
  the expression, and the bluer the colour is, the lower the expression. The column
  represents the sample. (f), (g) The metabolomic view of pathway analysis using a
  metabolic analyser shows the most obvious metabolic pathway affected by DENV infection.
  (hâ€“m) A violin diagram of metabolites was used to distinguish the DENV infection
  group from the control group. (h) Fructose 6-phosphate, (i) nopaline, (j) succinic
  acid, (k) sucrose, (l) D-mannose, and (m) L-threonine.
