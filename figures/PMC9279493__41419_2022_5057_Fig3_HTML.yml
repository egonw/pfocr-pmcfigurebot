figure_title: IL-21 secreted by Tfh drives B cell class switching to IgG in tumor
  lesion
caption: 'A The heatmap showing GSEA enrichment of the CXCL13, Tfh cell, and 12-chemokine
  signatures in treatment-naive, non-MPR, and MPR tumor tissues. Padj > 0.05 in the
  enrichment pathway was adjusted to 0 to draw the heat map. B The higher TLS density
  in neoadjuvant tumor lesions verified by mIHC staining in a single-cell sequencing
  cohort. C Higher intratumoral C2-CD4-IL7R and C4-CD4-TCF7 cluster proportions in
  neoadjuvant tumor lesions in scRNA profiles. D IL21 expression in different tissue
  types tested with Wilcoxon in scRNA profiles showing that IL21 was most prevalent
  in tumor tissues. ****p < 0.0001. E Go biological function analysis of the IL21
  expression cells by clusterprofiler in scRNA profiles. F Flow cytometry of IL-21
  in CD4+ T cells in tumor tissues. Data presented as mean ± SEM. Data were summarized
  from n = 8 treatment-naive, n = 5 non-MPR and n = 15 MPR tumor samples. P values
  were determined by ordinary one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns: not significant.
  G Comparison of paired plasma IL-21 before and after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
  P values were determined by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, two-tailed.
  *p < 0.05. H, I MIHC staining showing CD4+IL21+ and IgG-positive cells were much
  abundant in MPR tumor tissues (image under 10× and 20×). Data presented as mean ± SEM.
  Data were summarized from n = 6 treatment-naive, n = 9 non-MPR and n = 18 MPR tumor
  samples. P values were determined by ordinary one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, ns: not
  significant.'
