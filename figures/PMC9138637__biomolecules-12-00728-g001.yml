caption: Glutamine metabolism is downregulated in AT2 cells of patients with IPF.
  (A) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) graphical representation
  of 47,531 epithelial cells from 44 IPF and 38 control lungs (top), disease status
  (bottom left), and subjects (bottom right). Each dot represents a single cell and
  cells are labeled as one of eight discrete cell varieties, with AT2 cells labeled
  by the number 2. (B) Dotplot of the canonical marker gene expression in eight epithelial
  cell types. Node size is proportional to the percentage of cells in the cluster
  expressing a gene. Node color is proportional to the average expression level of
  the gene in the cluster. (C) Violin plots show gene expression in AT2 cells from
  the samples in 1A, and the upregulated (red) gene GLUL and the downregulated (blue)
  genes SFTPC, ABCA3, GLS1, GOT2, OGDH, SUCLG1, and SUCLG2 are depicted. (D) Glutamine
  metabolism pathway diagram shows the genetic alterations that regulate the related
  enzymes, according to the integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data from healthy donors
  or patients with IPF. Upregulated and downregulated genes are marked in red and
  blue, respectively. *** p < 0.001.
