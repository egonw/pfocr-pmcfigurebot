caption: The Maiti group introduced an efficient methodology to access substituted
  benzimidazoles via the reaction between β-ketoesters or amides and o-phenylenediamines
  using silica supported ferric chloride (3 mol%) as a catalyst. Products were isolated
  in high yields and the catalyst could be recycled for up to five cycles without
  a considerable decrease in the reaction yields (). A reaction mechanism involving
  the role of the catalyst was proposed. The group also employed 1-butyl-3-methyl
  imidazolium bromide as a catalyst for the assembly of benzimidazoles. The condensation
  reaction between 1,2-diaminobenzenes and β-ketoesters or amides occurred at elevated
  temperature and formed products in good to excellent yields. A reaction pathway
  involving the formation of a 1,5-benzodiazepinone intermediate was presented ().
