caption: 'Effects of various miR-125 (100 nM) and/or Afa (300 nM) formulations on
  mitophagy and mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis pathway after 24 h treatment in AGS
  cells. (A) Scheme of mitophagy and mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis pathway (↑:
  increase; ↓: decrease). (B) Images of various formulations on mitophagy by using
  confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Blue: DAPI (a nuclear dye); red: MitoRed
  (a mitochondrial dye); green: Cy5-LC3II (a marker of autophagy). Scale bar, 20 µm.
  (C) Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨm) by using MMP kit
  (JC-1; 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl benzimidazolo-carbocyanine iodide;
  5 mg/mL) by flow cytometry (statistical significance at *** p < 0.001). (D) Measurement
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS by using a fluorescent kit (mitoSOX™)
  by flow cytometry (statistical significance at *** p < 0.001). (E) (Up) Effect of
  various formulations on the expression of mitophagy and mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis
  pathway. (Down) Quantification of relative protein levels of mitophagy and mitochondrion-mediated
  apoptosis pathway. * p < 0.05 compared with CTR, † p < 0.05 compared with miR-125/SLN-KL,
  ‡ p < 0.05 compared with Afa, ¶ p < 0.05 compared with Afa/SLN, and § p < 0.05 compared
  with Afa/SLN-KL via Student’s t-test analysis. (F) (Left) Measurement of apoptosis
  percentages by detecting Annexin V/PI kit with the use of a flow cytometer. (Right)
  Quantification of relative cell population percentages from Annexin V/PI assay.
  * p < 0.05 compared with CTR, # p < 0.05 compared with SLN-KL, † p < 0.05 compared
