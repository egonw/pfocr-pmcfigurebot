caption: DMM surgery induces an acute systemic inflammatory response in Ripk2104Asp
  mice. Quantification of serum A) IL1β, B) IFNβ, and C) IL10 levels from 16-week-old
  WT and Ripk2104Asp mice just prior to DMM surgery (black diamonds and triangles)
  and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-surgery (magenta triangles and red circles). Error
  bars represent ±SD and statistically significant differences of P ≤ 0.01 (**) and
  P ≤ 0.001 (***) were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey‟s multiple comparisons
  test (4-week post-DMM group) and a two-tailed unpaired t-test (8 and 12 week groups).
