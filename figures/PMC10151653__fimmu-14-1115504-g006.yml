caption: BST2 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A), The expressions of key proteins
  of NF-κB pathway were measured by western blot analysis after transfection with
  Si-BST2 or Si-NC for 48h. (B), The Representative images of Immunofluorescence showed
  the cellular localization of NF-κB p65 protein in EESCs after transfection with
  Si-BST2 or Si-NC for 48h. (C, D), The protein expressions of NF-κB pathway were
  measured by western blot analysis after treatment with Si-BST2 or Si-NC or/and the
  NF-κB pathway activator IL-1β. ns, p ≥ 0.05; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001.
