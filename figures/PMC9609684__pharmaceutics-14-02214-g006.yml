caption: 'Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. (A) H&E staining of some tumors as
  examples of the different groups and the pixel classification; red-colored pixels
  show the tumor viable cells, black-colored pixels show the necrotic cells, and green-colored
  pixels show the stroma. (B) Bars show the average percentage of necrotic cells,
  viable cells, and stroma per individual tumor per group (G3–G9). Images were taken
  from QuPath software set at a 0.5× magnification; the scale bar is equal to 2 mm.
  An ANOVA test was computed to compare the necrotic area percentage between groups.
  In the graph, different letters inside the bars indicate differences (p < 0.0001)
  in the necrotic area between the groups. Controls G1 and G2 (no tumor developed)
  treated with liposomes loaded with lunasin 30 mg/kg BW and unsaponifiable matter,
  either applied topically or injected subcutaneously, respectively; G3, untreated
  positive group (tumor-bearing mice); G4, empty liposomes topically applied (tumor-bearing
  mice); G5, empty liposomes injected subcutaneously (tumor-bearing mice); treated
  groups (with tumor transplantation): G6, liposomes loaded with 30 mg/kg BW lunasin
  applied topically applied; G7, liposomes loaded with 30 mg/kg BW lunasin injected
  subcutaneously; G8, liposomes loaded with 15 mg/kg BW lunasin applied topically;
  G9, liposomes loaded with 15 mg/kg BW lunasin injected subcutaneously. Pearson’s
  correlation showed a negative correlation (r = −0.83, p < 0.05) between tumor size
  and caspase-3 expression. Therefore, the caspase-3 expression was higher in tumors
  with a smaller size and lower in tumors with a higher tumor volume. Tumors treated
  with UM + LunLip under-expressed the proliferation markers Ki-67 and GSK-3β and
  overexpressed caspase-3 (). In general, these results suggest the activation of
  the apoptosis pathway through caspase-3 overexpression, which could be initiated
  after GSK-3β inhibition. The UM + LunLip treatments affected cell cycle progression,
  as indicated by the under-expression of Ki-67.'
