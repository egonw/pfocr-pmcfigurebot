caption: Validation of five differentially expressed novel miRNAs, (A) osa-novmiR1,
  (B) osa-novmiR2, (C) osa-novmiR3, (D) osa-novmiR4, and (E) osa-novmiR5 through miRNA-specific
  qRT-PCR, identified from miRNA sequencing results of Swarnaprabha and IR8 after
  low light treatment with respect to control. Each miRNA was amplified using an mRQ
  3′primer along with miRNA-specific and U6-specific 5′ primers. The primer sequences
  are provided in . (# = miRNA-seq). Error bars are ±SD of the average of three miRNA-specific
  qRT-PCR replicates.
