figure_title: Genome-wide transcriptional assessment of lineage converted Epi- and
  Am-spheroids
caption: 'A, Pearson correlation analysis of control Epi-, Am-spheroids and specific
  pathway perturbations for lineage conversion conducted in cell line #1 with or without
  MEFs. Correlation is pseudo-bulk of all cells passing quality control (Epi-spheroid
  #1: 32 cells, ActA with MEFs: 29 cells, ActA no MEFs: 31 cells, FGF2 no MEFs: 31
  cells, CHIR with MEFs: Am-spheroid #1: 31 cells, 31 cells, BMP4 no MEFs: 25 cells,
  BMP4 with MEFs: 31 cells, SB43 with MEFs: 30 cells) B, Single-cell RNA-seq Seurat-normalized
  mRNA levels for POU5F1 (EmDisc & amnion lineage marker), MIXL1 (Gastrulation marker),
  TFAP2C and TFAP2A (amnion lineage markers). C-G, Principal component analysis of
  adjusted expression values using a set of genes identified via canonical correlation
  analysis comparing in vivo dataset to control Epi- and Am-spheroids (C) with the
  perturbed samples: BMP4 with MEFs (D) Activin-A with (E) and without (F) MEFs, and
  SB43 with MEFs (G). Silhouettes and decision boundary respectively highlight the
  perturbation shown in each plot and the segregation of EmDisc and amnion samples.'
