figure_title: Amo, Desl and Map inhibit the signaling cascades downstream of the three
  UPR pathways
caption: a Immunoblot of HEK293T cells showing the effects of the three compounds
  on the PERK-CHOP pathway. Quantification of phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK), ATF4 and
  CHOP 24 h after DMSO, Amo, Desl, or Map (10 µM) treatment in the presence of Tm/Tg
  (1 µM), relative to control (without Tm/Tg). b Immunoblot showing the effects of
  the three compounds on the ATF6 pathway. Quantification of total ATF6 protein level
  24 h after DMSO, Amo, Desl or Map treatment in the presence of Tm/Tg, relative to
  control (without Tm/Tg). c RT-PCR showing the mRNA levels of un-spliced and spliced
  forms of XBP-1 (XBP-1u and XBP-1s). Quantification of XBP-1s mRNA level 24 h after
  DMSO, Amo, Desl, or Map treatment in the presence of Tm/Tg, relative to control
  (without Tm/Tg). d Immunoblot showing the effects of the three compounds on the
  IRE1α-XBP-1/JNK pathway. Quantification of XBP-1s, phosphorylated JNK and IRE1α
  24 h after DMSO, Amo, Desl, or Map treatment in the presence of Tm/Tg, relative
  to control (without Tm/Tg). e qPCR mRNA measurement of the UPR genes in HEK293T
  cells treated for 12 h with DMSO, Amo, Desl, Map (10 µM) in the presence of Tm/Tg
  (1 µM), relative to control (without Tm/Tg). All data in this figure are presented
  as means ± s.e.m., n = 3 independent replicates, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Source data
  are provided as a Source data file.
