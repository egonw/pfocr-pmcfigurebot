caption: The promiscuity of HpaBC and design of a microbial consortia catalysis strategy.
  (A) The color change of strain with pRSF-HT plasmid, CCHT-1, and CCHT-2 cultured
  with total 10 mM substrate (tyrosin and tyrosol). (B) Catalytic activities of HpaBC
  towards different substrates. (C) Design of a microbial consortia catalysis strategy
  by dividing the biosynthetic pathway into two individual strains. Data are expressed
  as the mean Â± SD (n = 3). **** p < 0.0001, compared to the control.
