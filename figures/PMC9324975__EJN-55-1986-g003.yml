caption: Photoreceptor‐directed pupil responses and reaction times (RT) during active
  and passive attention in a visual detection task. Data (n = 6 observers) are coded
  green for melanopsin‐directed responses, grey for LMS‐cone‐directed responses and
  orange for the combined‐stimulus responses. (a) Pupil responses to 1 s duration
  incremental pulses of three photoreceptor‐directed stimulus types during passive
  attention. Data show the average ± 95% confidence limits of ~600 total trials per
  condition. (b) Task‐evoked pupil dilation (TEPD) during active covert attention
  (average ± 95% confidence limits). The vertical dotted line approximates the average
  time of the observer response (reaction time) and the green down‐arrows denote the
  timing of the peaks of the biphasic dilation in response to melanopsin‐containing
  stimuli. (c) Average baseline diameter (mm ± SEM) across all observers and repeats
  as a function of the trial number during testing blocks with passive attention or
  active attention (open circular symbols). (d) Visual reaction time frequency distributions
  to offset of the supra‐threshold (1.75× threshold) photoreceptor‐directed stimuli
  are described by their best‐fitting hyperbolic secant functions (solid lines). Data
  were pooled across all observers and trials. (e) Boxplots (median, interquartile
  range and whiskers for the minimum and maximum) of the RT‐locked TEPD amplitudes
  (% baseline) for all observers and trials for the three photoreceptor‐directed stimuli.
  The group average TEPD amplitude is written. (f) Boxplots of the RT‐locked time
  to peak TEPD amplitude for all observers and trials for the three photoreceptor‐directed
  stimuli. The group average time to peak TEPD amplitudes is written. (g) Predictive
  model (black dashed line, Equation ) of the RT‐locked (time zero) TEPD with a weighted
  linear addition of the measured melanopsin‐ (green) and cone‐directed inputs (grey)
  to the pupil control pathway provides an adequate description of the measured combined
  (melanopsin and cone) pupil response (orange). Asterisks represent *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001
