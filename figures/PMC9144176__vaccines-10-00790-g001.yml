caption: Model of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in presence of Wnt ligand. Binding of
  Wnt to the receptors Frizzled (Fz) and Lrp6 leads to inhibition of β-catenin degradation.
  After stabilization, β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus and interacts with
  members of the TCF/Lef-1 family of transcription factors to co-activate expression
  of numerous oncogenes involved in proliferation and migration, in particular Cyclin
  D1 and c-myc, as well as other genes, including Twist, Snail, ZEB1, and MITF, thus,
  facilitating EMT. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 29 April 2022).
