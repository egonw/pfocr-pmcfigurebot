caption: 'H&E staining at postnatal day 1 in Smad4 mouse line. The dox was given at
  embryonic day 0 and the eyeballs were collected at postnatal day 1 (between postnatal
  0 h to 24 h) (A,B) HE-staining revealed the normal development of eyeball including
  the good formation of the corneal epithelium (Epi), endothelium (End) and stroma
  (Str) (C,D) and the normal distribution of keratocyte in corneal stroma in both
  Smad4Ctrl and Smad4kera-cko. Abbreviations: Epi, epithelium; Str, stroma; End, endothelium.'
