caption: Thyroxine (T4)-induced PD-L1 accumulation is activated-STAT3-dependent in
  human oral cancer OEC-M1 cells. Oral cancer OEC-M1 cells were seeded on a cover
  glass. Cells were starved for 48 h, fed hormone-stripped serum-containing medium,
  and then treated with T4 in the presence and absence of 40 μM S31-201 for another
  24 h. Cells were fixed for confocal microscopic analysis of PD-L1 accumulation (red
  color). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue color). The field of view of
  the red square is magnified for easy viewing.
