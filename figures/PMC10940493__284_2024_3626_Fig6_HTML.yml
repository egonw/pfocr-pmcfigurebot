caption: Snapshot of metabolic pathways on KEGG Level 3 identified within the indicator
  OTUs from Austria (denoted in red) and Uganda (denoted in green). The horizontal
  axis represents the average proportions of each pathway, facilitating a comparison
  between the two regions. Pathway selection was guided by a cut-off criterion of
  a mean proportion distance greater than |0.0015| between the two regions. Noteworthy
  distinctions, marked by significant differences at P < 0.05, are indicated on the
  right side
