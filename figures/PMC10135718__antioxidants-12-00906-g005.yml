caption: Proposed models of the inhibitory peptide effects on NO-cGMP signaling pathway
  and SNO transnitrosation cascades. (A) Under reducing conditions, in smooth muscle
  cells for example, rTrx1 and GC1 associate via a mixed disulfide between C610 of
  the GC1 α subunit and C32 of Trx1 [] (C610 is endogenously S-nitrosated [] or/and
  engaged in a disulfide). In turn, Trx1 increases NO-stimulated GC1 activity thus
  enhancing the NO-GC1-cGMP pathway (1). Addition of the inhibitory peptide, by blocking
  the Trx1-GC1 complex formation, blunts Trx1 enhancement of NO-stimulated GC1 activity
  (2). (B) Oxidative and/or nitrosative stress induces multiple S-nitrosation of GC1
  and oxidation of Trx1 (oTrx1). In Jurkat T cells, the levels of S-nitrosation are
  endogenously elevated; a transnitrosation cascade initiated by SNO-GC1 and mediated
  by oTrx1 leads to caspase-3 S-nitrosation, which renders it inactive leading to
  cell proliferation (1). In the presence of the inhibitory peptide, SNO-GC1 and oTrx1
  interaction is blocked, the transnitrosation cascade is disrupted; thus, caspase
  3 remains active, supporting cell death (2).
