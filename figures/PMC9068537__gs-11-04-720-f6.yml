caption: Co-expressed genes of STAT4 and their associated enrichment pathways analyzed
  using the Metascape database demonstrated that they were mainly enriched in numerous
  immune-related biological processes, such as the adaptive immune response, T cell
  activation, T cell receptor signaling pathway, and negative regulation of immune
  system processes. STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
