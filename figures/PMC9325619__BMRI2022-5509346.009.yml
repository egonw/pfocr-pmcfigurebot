caption: HS3ST1 promotes the development of NSCLC by regulating SPOP/FADD/NF-κB pathway.
  (a) The effects of SPOP overexpression, FADD knockdown, and NF-κB knockdown on the
  viability of A549 cells. (b) The effects of SPOP overexpression, FADD knockdown,
  and NF-κB knockdown on the apoptosis of A549 cells. (c) The effects of SPOP overexpression,
  FADD knockdown, and NF-κB knockdown on the cell cycle distribution of A549 cells.
  (d) The effects of SPOP overexpression, FADD knockdown, and NF-κB knockdown on the
  wound healing rate of A549 cells. (e) The effects of SPOP overexpression, FADD knockdown,
  and NF-κB knockdown on the Transwell cell counts of A549 cells. ∗∗P < 0.01 between
  two groups, N = 12.
