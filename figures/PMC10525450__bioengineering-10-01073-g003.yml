caption: Construction of the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in HEK293T cells. (A)
  Expression of EGFP and mCherry in HEK293T cells transfected with pPYLG + pWZG-P2A
  plasmids. (B) HPLC analysis of cells transfected with above-mentioned plasmids.
  Can, canthaxanthin; Ast, astaxanthin; E, trans geometric isomer; and Z, cis geometric
  isomer. (C) Total ketocarotenoid concentration graph compared with the ratio of
  astaxanthin and canthaxanthin content. DW, dry weight. (D) Astaxanthin and canthaxanthin
  concentration graphs from cell extracts transfected with pPYLG + pWZG-P2A plasmids.
  (E) Pie charts show total ketocarotenoids with different percentages of astaxanthin
  and canthaxanthin content.
