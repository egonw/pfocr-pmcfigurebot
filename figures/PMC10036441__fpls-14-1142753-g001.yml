caption: Biosynthesis and metabolism of phytomelatonin in plants. The major pathway
  of phytomelatonin synthesis is indicated by solid blue arrows, whereas the alternative
  pathway is indicated by solid black arrows. The phytomelatonin metabolism pathway
  is marked by dashed arrows. All enzymes in these pathways are indicated in red.
