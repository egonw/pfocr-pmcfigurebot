caption: Network crosstalk of molecular mechanisms during ferroptosis development.
  (1) GPX protein regulates ferroptosis by clearing lipid peroxide products on the
  membrane. (2) FSPA gene regulates ferroptosis by acting on reducing and oxidizing
  substrates. (3) E-cadherin/NF2/Hippo/YAP signaling pathway regulates ferroptosis
  by mediating the activity of ferroptosis regulatory factors. (4) AMPK signaling
  pathway regulates ferroptosis by initiating an energy stress protective program.
  (5) HIF-2 Î±/The HILPDA signaling pathway regulates ferroptosis by affecting phospholipid
  peroxidation.
