caption: 'Effects of KEPS and KE on the bioluminescence signaling of LPS-induced inflammation
  in NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice. Control (Con) group received no treatment,
  serving as the negative control; LPS group was treated with 12.5 mg/kg LPS alone;
  KEPS/LPS group received oral administration of 100 mg/kg KEPS for 7 days, followed
  by treatment with 12.5 mg/kg LPS; KE/LPS group received oral administration of 100
  mg/kg KE for 7 days followed by treatment with 12.5 mg/kg LPS; and ASA/LPS group
  was treated with 12.5 mg/kg LPS and 12.5 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as the
  positive control. (A) The IVIS images of female NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice,
  and (B) the quantification data of bioluminescence signals in female mice. KEPS,
  KE, and ASA significantly reduced the LPS-induced bioluminescence signals in female
  mice compared to the LPS alone group. (C) The IVIS images of male NF-κB-luciferase+/+
  transgenic mice, and (D) the quantification data of bioluminescence signals in male
  mice. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *** p < 0.001 compared to
  the control group. ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compared to the LPS group. &p < 0.05
  compared to the KE/LPS group.'
