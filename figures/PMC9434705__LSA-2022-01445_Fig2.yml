figure_title: Mutant BRAF melanoma cells resistant to PLX4032 cells rewire ERK and
  MST2 pathways
caption: (A) A375, SK-Mel28, and WM-793 cell were grown in increasing concentration
  of PLX4032 for 6 mo. Parental (P) and resistant (R) cells grown without PLX4032
  for 48 h were treated with PLX4032 (3 μM) for 1 h and ERK activation was determined
  by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) Parental and resistant A375,
  SK-Mel28 and WM-793 cells were treated with PLX4032 (3 μM) for 24 h and DNA fragmentation
  was determined but PI staining using FACS. Error bars show SD, (n = 3). (A, C) Parental
  and resistant cells were treated as in (A) and the expression of MST2 pathway proteins
  and GAPDH as loading control were determined by immunoblotting with the indicated
  antibodies. (D) Parental and PLX4032 resistant cells were treated with PLX4032 (3
  μM) and/or trametinib (10 nM) for 1 h. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with the
  indicated antibodies. (E) Lysates from serum deprived (16 h) parental and resistant
  cells were incubated with GST-RBD to determine the amount of RAS GTP. A lysate aliquot
  was used to determine total RAS expression. Expression of RAS isoforms was determined
  by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (F) Parental (P) and resistant
  A375 (R) cells were lysed and cell extracts were incubated with PathScan RTK Signaling
  Antibody Arrays. Red boxes show ALK and PDGF-receptor spots. In all blots numbers
  indicate molecular weight (kD).Source data are available for this figure.
