caption: Effect of seladelpar on CYP7A1 expression in primary human hepatocytes. Primary
  human hepatocytes were treated with seladelpar (10 μM) for 48 h and gene expression
  was analyzed by qPCR. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. of two independent replicates.
  ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 denote the significant difference between control and seladelpar.
article_title: Selective PPARδ agonist seladelpar suppresses bile acid synthesis by
  reducing hepatocyte CYP7A1 via the fibroblast growth factor 21 signaling pathway.
