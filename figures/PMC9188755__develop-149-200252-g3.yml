caption: 'Nodal and Goosecoid are co-expressed in the anterior dorsal paraxial mesoderm,
  which also expresses Dmbx, after FGFR inhibition. Double in situ hybridization of
  Nodal and Goosecoid (A-J′) and of Nodal and Dmbx (K′-T″) in control and SU5402-treated
  embryos fixed at 15 hpf (G6) and 18 hpf (N1). Dorsal views and transverse views
  are shown for in situ hybridization data, with anterior towards the top and dorsal
  towards the top, respectively. Single-channel (DAPI in blue, Nodal in magenta, Goosecoid
  and Dmbx in green) and merged channel images are shown. For 18 hpf stage embryos,
  two transverse sections are presented: one at the level of the first somite pair
  (X,H′,H″,R″) and another one at the level of the second somite pair (Z,J′,J″,T″).
  The white arrowheads indicate the position of the first somite/presumptive somite
  pair in panels corresponding to 15 hpf embryos, and the position of the left first
  (C′-H′,C″-H″,M″-R″) or second somite region (I′,J′,I″,J″,S″,T″) in panels corresponding
  to 18 hpf embryos. At least five embryos per stage were analysed and they all showed
  the same pattern. Scale bar: 25 µm.'
