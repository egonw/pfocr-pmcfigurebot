caption: Basal ganglia–brain stem network in normal and parkinsonism conditions. (A)
  Top. Simplified schematic of the BG-brain stem network in normal conditions. A recent
  anatomical and functional description of the nigro-vagal pathway that influences
  the vagal output to the upper gastrointestinal tract is included. The DMNV and NAmb
  originate the vagal efferent that controls the GI. Both nuclei modulated vago-vagal
  reflexes that mediate both swallowing and gastric emptying. In addition to the PPN,
  the network modulates the medullar central pattern generator, which regulates the
  different swallowing phases. Bottom. Left. The drawing represents a typical trace
  of an electrogastrogram in normal conditions after meal ingestion. A regular amplitude
  and rhythmicity are observed. Right. The graph represents desynchronization (mu
  ERD) in the premotor area at the level of the beta band in normal swallowing. (B)
  Simplified schematic of the BG-brain stem network in parkinsonism conditions. Top.
  Degeneration of the SNc causes DA loss and induces altered modulation of the nigro-vagal
  pathway into its targets in the brain stem. Consequently, the vagal output to the
  upper gastrointestinal tract is changed and could be involved in the gastrointestinal
  symptoms of PD. Bottom. The drawing represents a trace of an electrogastrogram in
  parkinsonism after meal ingestion. Irregular rhythmicity and decreased amplitude
  are observed compared with normal conditions. The graft was elaborated based on
  the data reported in the main text and supported by the respective references.
