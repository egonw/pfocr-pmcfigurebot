caption: (a) Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship between Chromohalobacter canadensis
  85B and other microorganisms. The accession numbers and length of sequences used
  are shown in brackets (b) Subsystems in the C. canadensis 85B genome. (c) Number
  of genes associated with general COG functional categories. (d) Polyhydroxybutyrate
  (PHB) synthesis pathway prediction according to KEGG. Intermediates from both glycolysis
  and fatty acid metabolism. (S)‐3‐Hydroxybutanoyl‐CoA is an important intermediate
  as it links the PHB synthesis pathway and fatty acid metabolism. fadN, fadB, fadJ
  and fadB, and fadJ, are fatty acid degradation enzymes, 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase
  [EC:1.1.1.157] (paaH), 3‐hydroxyacyl‐CoA dehydrogenase [EC:1.1.1.35] (HADH), EHHADH.
