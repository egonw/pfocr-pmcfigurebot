caption: 'Hypoxia-pretreated CGMs ameliorate cartilage inflammatory response and oxidative
  stress and activate NRF2/HO-1 pathway in subacute OA rat. (A and B) Synovial inflammation
  in each group was determined by H&E staining and scored (n ​= ​5). (C) Immunohistochemical
  staining inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL6, and TNFα) in different groups (n ​= ​5).
  Scale bar, 25 ​μm. (D–F) Quantification of IL-1β-positivity, IL6-positivity, and
  TNFα-positivity in chondrocytes after different treatments in subacute OA rat (n ​= ​5).
  (G) Immunohistochemical staining of antioxidant enzyme SOD1 and the NRF2/HO-1 pathway-associated
  markers (NRF2, HO-1, and NQO1) in different groups (n ​= ​5). Scale bar, 25 ​μm.
  (H) Quantification of SOD1-positive chondrocytes after different treatments (n ​= ​5).
  (I–K) Quantification of NRF2-positivity, HO-1-positivity, and NQO1-positivity in
  chondrocytes in different groups (n ​= ​5). Data represent mean ​± ​S.D. ∗∗∗P ​< ​0.001
  versus the Sham group. #P ​< ​0.05, ###P ​< ​0.001 versus the PBS group. $$P ​< ​0.01,
  $$$P ​< ​0.001 versus the norm-CGMs group.'
