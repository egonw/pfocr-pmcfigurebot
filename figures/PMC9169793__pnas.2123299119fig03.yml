caption: Wheat cluster 3(5D) produces an isoarborinol-derived triterpenoid. (A) Structures
  of homologous triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters identified on wheat chromosomes
  5A and 5D. (B) GC-MS traces for wheat BGC 3(5D) genes transiently expressed in N.
  benthamiana. EIC, extracted-ion chromatogram for ions representing isoarborinol
  (7) (498.5), 19-hydroxy-isoarborinol (8) (496.5), 19-hydroxy-isoarborinone (9) (494.5),
  ellarinacin (10) (405.5), and internal standard 5α-cholestan-3β-ol (460.4). (C)
  Assigned structure of ellarinacin and predicted biosynthetic pathway in wheat. TaIAH,
  isoarborinol 19-hydroxylase; TaIAS, isoarborinol synthase; TaHID, 19-hydroxy-isoarborinol
  dehydrogenase; TaHIO, 19-hydroxy-isoarborinone oxidase. Rings A through E are annotated.
  (D) Semiquantitative RT-PCR of selected genes from type 3 clusters 3(5A) and 3(5D)
  in Chinese Spring wheat tissues. C, coleoptile; I, inflorescence; L, leaf; Li, leaf
  infected with B. graminis f. sp. tritici; Lw, leaf after wounding; R, root; S, stem;
  T, root tip; Ti, root tip after infection with G. graminis.
