caption: Kinase activity of AKT1, MAPK3, and PAK2 is enhanced in erlotinib-resistant
  MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells. (A) Kinases with only KSEA scores (at least 2 substrates)
  were plotted. (B) Heatmap of kinases with KSEA and KSEAM scores and average logarithmic
  (base 2) fold-change for kinases expression in resistant/sensitive. Statistics for
  z-scores and kinase fold-changes were calculated using one-tailed Student’s t-tests
  controlled by the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR (False-Discover Rate) procedure. * = corrected
  p-value of <0.05 at FDR = 0.1.
