caption: 'OpHcd2 depleted cells are defective in mitotic exit and cytokinesis. (a)
  Serial dilutions of strains with the indicated genotype were spotted on YPDS agar
  plates containing IAA, 5-Ph-IAA, or 5-Ad-IAA at the indicated concentrations and
  incubated at 30 °C for 1 day. Yeast strains: HPH656, HPH2067, HPH2254, HPH2246,
  HPH2270, HPH2244, HPH2245, HPH2247. (b) DAPI staining of iAIDOp-hcd2-as strains.
  Wild type (HPH2247) and iAIDOp-hcd2-as cells (HPH2245) carrying PADH1-OsTIRF74A,
  PCMV-tTA, POpTEF1-TetR’-OpSSN6-5flag were grown in YPDS medium until logarithmic
  growth phase. Dox was added at 5 µg/mL to repress the expression of the mAID-hcd2-as
  gene, IAA at 0.5 mM to induce the mAID-OpHcd2-as protein degradation, and 1NM-PP1
  at 5 µM to inhibit the activity of any residual iAIDOp-Hcd2-as that escaped degradation,
  and incubated at 30 °C for up to 2 h. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and DNA
  was stained with DAPI. Shown are merged images of brightfield and DAPI images. Scale
  bar, 5 µm. Arrows indicate failure of cell separation in the previous mitosis. (c)
  Quantification of b. Upper graphs: percentage of unbudded cells with one nucleus.
  Lower graphs: percentage of large budded cells with two nuclei, one in the mother
  and the other in the bud, and three or more unseparated cell bodies with two or
  more nuclei. Statistical significance was determined by the t-test and is indicated
  by asterisks. (d) GFP-tubulin was examined by epifluorescence microscopy in wild
  type and iAIDOp-hcd2-as strains. Wild type (HPH2258) and iAIDOp-hcd2-as cells (HPH2260)
  carrying PADH1- OsTIRF74A, PCMV-tTA, POpTEF1-TetR’-OpSSN6-5flag and expressing GFP-TUB1
  were grown in YPDS medium until logarithmic growth phase. Dox, IAA, and 1NM-PP1
  were added at 5 µg/mL, 0.5 mM, and 5 µM, respectively, and incubated at 30 °C for
  up to 2 h. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and then washed with
  PBS before microscopy. Asterisks indicate anaphase spindle. Shown are merged images
  of brightfield image and DAPI images. Scale bar, 5 µm. (e) Quantification of d.
  Upper graphs: percentage of unbudded G1 cells. Lower graphs: percentage of budded
  cells with anaphase spindle and three or more unseparated cell bodies without anaphase
  spindle. Statistical significance was determined by the t-test and indicated by
  asterisks. (f) Incomplete cytokinesis and cell separation of iAIDOp-hcd2-as cells
  from the experiment in (d). Asterisks indicate newly formed buds. Yellow and white
  arrows point to the complete separation and the connection between mother and daughter
  cells of the previous cell cycle, respectively. Brightfield (left) and epifluorescence
  (GFP) (right) image. Scale bar, 2 µm.'
