caption: Differential gene and pathway expression analysis revealed key genes and
  potential drug targets involved in the host translation machinery with SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection. (A) Upregulation of the interferon signalling pathway in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected
  samples reveals many key genes and potential drug targets. This pathway figure was
  designed in BioRender.com based on the EIF2AK2 pathway diagram indicated as significantly
  represented in our data sets by IPA. Elements of the pathway not significant in
  the data sets analysed were excluded for clarity. Compounds identified from the
  DGIdb analysis whose effects on COVID‐19 have been suggested by other studies are
  shown modulating their respective targets. (B) Downregulation of key genes in the
  eIF2 signalling pathway reveals how SARS‐CoV‐2 interferes with host cell translation
  machinery to inhibit host protein synthesis. The eIF2 signalling pathway indicated
  as significant in our data sets by IPA was recreated in BioRender.com to highlight
  the elements of the pathway most significantly represented in our data. Genes that
  were not significantly differentially expressed in our data sets and did not interact
  with key genes were excluded from the figure for clarity. EIF2AK2 was the only potential
  drug target identified by DGIdb analysis within this pathway, shown modulated by
  PKR inhibitors. Figure legend was also designed in BioRender.com .
