caption: 'Inhibition of ASCT2 restricts proinflammatory SASP in senescent HSCs. (A)
  mRNA changes under the indicated conditions were observed by RNA-seq. Heat map indicates
  the fold changes of SASP factors in proliferating LX2 cells vs. etoposide-induced
  senescent LX2 cells vs. ASCT2 depletion-derived senescent LX2 cells. n = 3 per group.
  (B) GSEA analysis of glutamine genes and TCA cycle genes in the proliferating LX2
  cells vs. ASCT2 depletion-derived senescent LX2 cells. (C) GSEA analysis of DNA
  replication genes and G1 checkpoints genes in proliferating LX2 cells vs. ASCT2
  depletion derived-senescent LX2 cells. (D, E) mRNAs of the proinflammatory SASP:
  IL1A, IL1B, IL6, and IL8 were determined by qPCR in the indicated cells (n = 3–10
  per group). (F, G) EdU incorporation and SA-β-Gal staining for senescence determination
  after 4-OHT stimulation (n = 8 per group). (H) Cell cycle distribution was determined
  by flow cytometry after 4-OHT stimulation (n = 3 per group). (I–L) mRNA levels of
  IL1B, IL6, and IL8, and protein levels of IL-8 were established by qPCR and Western
  blot (n = 3–5 per group). Bars indicate the mean ± SEM; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01; ns,
  no significance.'
