caption: Spatial transcriptomic analysis of tumor-adjacent stroma and tumor. Heatmaps
  generated using the normalized expression values for genes from the Cancer Transcriptome
  Atlas, CTA panel for comparisons between (A) tumor epithelium and tumor-adjacent
  stroma and (B) CD45+ tumor epithelium and CD45+ tumor-adjacent stroma. The most
  significant genes (FDR < 0.2 and p-value < 0.05) that were differentially expressed
  among pairs of ROIs are shown. (C) Bar diagrams depicting selected significant pathways
  (p < 0.05) associated with downregulated genes and selected significant pathways
  (p < 0.05) associated with upregulated genes in TAS as compared to tumor. Complete
  pathway analysis can be found in , FDR = false discover rate; ROI = region of interest;
  TAS = tumor-adjacent stroma.
