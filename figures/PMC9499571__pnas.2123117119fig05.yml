caption: Signal peptide mutations lead to the accumulation of DG-proLirL in untreated
  G5132R cells. (A) Predicted molecular weights of LirL-ΔR truncated protein containing
  G5132R-1 mutations in the signal peptide (LirL-ΔRG5132R1). PA, palmitic acid; SP,
  signal peptide. (B) LC-UV-MS analysis of purified LirL-ΔRG5132R1 from untreated
  cells or cells treated with 44.4 μg/mL G5132 leads to the accumulation of DG-proLirLΔRG5132R1
  with or without an N-terminal fMet in untreated cells expressing LirL-ΔRG5132R1.
  As with LirL-ΔR, the +28-Da peak represents LirL-ΔRG5132R1 modified with acyl tails
  containing two additional carbons (CH2-CH2). RT denotes retention time. (C) Total
  cell lysates from untreated (−) or G5132-treated (+) Ab17978 expressing His-tagged
  LirL-ΔR or LirL-ΔRG5132R1 were subjected to western blot analysis. RNAPα was used
  as a loading control (“§” represents DG-proLirL-ΔR, and mature triacylated LirL-ΔR
  is depicted). (D) Proposed model explaining the mechanism of LirL resistance to
  G5132 in A. baumannii. In wild-type A. baumannii, LirL is processed by the lipoprotein
  biosynthetic enzymes Lgt, LspA, and Lnt into triacylated mature LirL localized to
  the IM. Treatment with G5132 leads to the accumulation of DG-proLirL in the IM,
  leading to a block in the pathway causing cell death. The G5132R mutations in the
  LirL signal peptide lead to DG-proLirL mutants that are not efficiently catalyzed
  by LspA, which overcomes the obstruction of lipoprotein biosynthetic flux causing
  G5132 resistance.
