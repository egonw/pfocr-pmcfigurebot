caption: RR promotes osteoblast differentiation as well as osteogenesis gene expression.
  (a–b) Cell viability of pre-osteoblasts with RR-treated for 48 h and 96 h. (c) After
  stimulating primary osteoblasts with osteogenesis induction solution (50 μg/ml vitamin
  C, 10 mM β-glycerol) and different concentrations of RR for 7 and 21 days. Representative
  image of ALP staining and ARS staining to show osteogenesis differentiation results.
  (d) ALP activity was detected at different concentrations of RR after stimulating
  primary osteoblasts for 7 days. (e) Different concentrations of RR stimulated pre-osteoblasts
  for 21 days. After using ARS staining, calcium nodules were dissolved, and the absorbance
  value of the lysate solution at 570 nm was determined. (f) Pre-osteoblasts were
  stimulated with the indicated different concentrations of RR for 7 days, using qPCR
  to show the mRNA level of the MCU. (g) Primary osteoblasts treated with or without
  osteogenic induction (OI) and RR (0.75 μM) for 48 h, and then, intracellular calcium
  concentration was measured. (h) The mRNA level of OPG, OCN, and OSX with MCU knockdown
  or not. (i) The relative mRNA expression level of osteoblast-specific genes, including
  ALP, Runx2, OPG, and OCN. (j) The bone-forming induction solution and different
  concentrations of RR (0.375 μM, 0.75 μM, and 1.5 μM) were used to stimulate BMSCs
  for 7 days, and the western blot results showed the protein expression levels of
  Runx2 and Col1α. (k) Quantitative analysis of protein expression levels, normalized
  to GAPDH. Data was presented as means ± SEM; n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
