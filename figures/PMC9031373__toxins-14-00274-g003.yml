caption: From Vogeley, C. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 6005. AHR-dependent signaling
  pathways. In its inactive state, AHR is part of a multiprotein complex consisting
  of different chaperone molecules and, possibly, tyrosine kinase c-Src. Upon ligand
  binding, the complex dissociates and AHR translocates into the nucleus, where it
  dimerizes with ARNT to form a transcriptionally active complex and induces the expression
  of target genes, for instance encoding CYP1 cytochrome p450 isoforms. In addition
  to this canonical signaling pathway, the ligand-driven dissociation of the cytosolic
  AHR multiportion complex stimulates c-Src activity, which is followed by activation
  of EGFR and downstream MAPK mitogen activated protein kinase signaling, resulting
  in the transcriptional induction of another set of genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2).
