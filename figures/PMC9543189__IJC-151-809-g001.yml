caption: Development of the Hypoxia score and TME score based on hypoxia‐related genes
  and TME cells respectively. (A) Heat map showing the relationships between the Hypoxia
  score and 48 prognostic hypoxia‐related genes in five HBV‐HCC cohorts. Positive
  (red) and negative (purple) correlations are indicated. Gray means missing values
  in that cohort. (B) Heat map showing the relationships between the TME score and
  19 prognostic TME cells in five HBV‐HCC cohorts. Positive (red) and negative (purple)
  correlations are indicated. (C) Kaplan‐Meier overall survival curves of four training
  cohorts in tumors with high Hypoxia score vs low Hypoxia score. (D) Kaplan‐Meier
  overall survival curves of four training cohorts in tumors with high TME score vs
  low TME score. (E) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of 109 genes represent HIF‐1
  signaling pathway reveals the association between Hypoxia score and HIF‐1 signaling
  pathway. High hypoxia score located in the left approaching the origin of the x‐axis,
  by contrast, low hypoxia score lay on the right of the x‐axis (GSE14520). (F) Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of 332 marker genes represent immune response display
  the association between TME score and immune response. High TME score located in
  the left approaching the origin of the x‐axis, by contrast, low TME score lay on
  the right of the x‐axis (GSE14520). (G) t‐SNE plot of all 3836 cells from 9 primary
  liver cancer patients. Cells were annotated based on known lineage‐specific marker
  genes as CD8 T cells, monocytes/macrophages, plasma cells, fibroblasts, malignant
  cells, endothelial cells, hepatic progenitor (GSE125449). (H) t‐SNE plot of all
  the single cells colored by Hypoxia score. (I) t‐SNE plot of all the single cells
  colored by TME score. (J) Comparisons of Hypoxia score among immune cells, malignant
  cells and stromal cells. (K) Comparisons of TME score among immune cells, malignant
  cells and stromal cells [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
