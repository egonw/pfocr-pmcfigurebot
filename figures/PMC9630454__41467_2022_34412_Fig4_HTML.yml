figure_title: STAT3 signaling is active in reactive inflammatory astrocytes in vitro
  and in human tissue samples from Alzheimer’s disease patients
caption: A Network analysis (confidence score >0.7) of the top 50 differentially expressed
  astrocytic genes encoding secreted factors, with corresponding endothelial genes
  encoding receptors. B Network analysis (confidence score >0.9) of the STAT3 interactome.
  C Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on DEGs (FDR < 0.1) between co-cultured astrocytes
  with or without TNF treatment. p values were calculated using a right-tailed Fisher’s
  exact test. D Representative images of pSTAT3Y705, C3, and GFAP expression in the
  cortex of an asymptomatic patient versus a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.
  E Quantification of nuclear pSTAT3Y705 intensity in the cortex of asymptomatic patients
  versus patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Statistical analyses were performed
  with a one-sided t test. F Quantification of nuclear pSTAT3Y705 intensity in GFAP-
  versus GFAP+ cells in the cortex of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease
  (70 cells counted per sample; n = 4 biological replicates). The boxes show the range
  between the 25th and 75th percentiles with a line and a plus sign indicating median
  and mean, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with a one-sided t test.
  G Pearson correlation of C3 intensity in GFAP+ astrocytes to nuclear pSTAT3Y705
  intensity of GFAP+ astrocyte in the cortex of four patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
  disease. Best-fit lines with a shaded area of 95% confidence intervals from linear
  regression, as well as the Pearson correlation coefficient and p value from a two-tailed
  test, are presented in the plot.
