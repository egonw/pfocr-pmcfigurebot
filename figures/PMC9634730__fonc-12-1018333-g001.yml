caption: The role of endogenous immune stimulatory noncoding RNA 7SL1 in the pathway
  for the regulation of the aberrant protein production (RAPP) and its possible application
  in cancer therapy. (A) Transcriptional regulation of 7SL1 and the downstream mechanism
  for tumor suppressor tumor protein P53 (TP53). MYC, proto-oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix
  (BHLH) transcription factor (MYC); FOXP3, forkhead box P3; PRC2, polycomb repression
  complex 2; SUZ12, SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit; EZH2, enhancer of
  zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; Pol III,
  RNA polymerase III; SRP, signal recognition particle; RIG-1, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene 1 protein; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; HuR, embryonic
  lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila (ELAV)-like 1, Hu antigen R. (B) Although the
  unshielded 7SL1-mediated stimulation of tumor tissues can result in disease progression,
  the exosomal delivery of 7SL1 or its combination with engineering chimeric antigen
  receptor (CAR)-T cells can stimulate an anti-tumor effect and lead to a favorable
  disease outcome. Ag, antigen.
