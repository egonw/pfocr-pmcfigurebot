caption: The inhibitory effect of alizarin, a Chinese medicine, on the growth of pancreatic
  cancer. A-B. 10 nature compounds with significant inhibitory effects on pancreatic
  cancer were selected from a chemical library containing 2951 candidates by cell
  viability assay. The IC50 of 10 natural compounds was shown and this experiment
  was repeated 3 times. C. Chemical formula of Chinese medicine monomer alizarin (left)
  and its ADME parameters (figure made in http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php) (right).
  D. GO enrichment analysis of alizarin. E. KEGG enrichment analysis of signaling
  pathway of alizarin. F. The inhibitory effect of different concentrations of alizarin
  (0μM, 5μM, 10μM, 20μM, 40μM and 80μM) on 5 types of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1,
  MIAPaCa-2, Capan-1, SW1990, BxPC3 cells) and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial
  cell (HPDE). G. CCK8 was used to detect the time- and dose-dependent inhibitory
  effect of alizarin on PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. H. The clone formation experiment was
  used to detect the effect of different concentrations of alizarin (0μM, 5μM, 10μM,
  20μM) on the clonogenic ability of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. *P <0.05, **P <0.01.
