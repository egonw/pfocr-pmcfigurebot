caption: Site-directed mutagenesis and location of the mutation sites. Mutations in
  (A) mOR256-8 pocket and ECL2 and (B) mOR256-3 ECL2 affected the response to various
  odorants. Data are mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. C, homology model
  of mOR256-3 selected according to the data in A and B. D, consensus ECL2 sequence
  of human and mouse ORs and location of the mutation sites. Effective mutations are
  colored in pink (in the pocket) or red (in ECL2). Noneffective mutations are colored
  in blue, including V993.27A, V1103.38T, L1985.38E, S2546.50T, R172ECL2N, I174ECL2L,
  L178ECL2F, I185ECL2L, M187ECL2L, V190ECL2T, A192ECL2T, and V195ECL2N in mOR256-8.
  In the 3D models, consistently, the noneffective mutation sites (blue) do not constitute
  the ligand-binding site or the pathway to the binding site. ECL2, extracellular
  loop 2.
