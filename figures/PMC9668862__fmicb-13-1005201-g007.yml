caption: Functional gene family and pathways analysis in metagenomic sequencing datasets.
  (A) Correlation network between six bacterial markers and differential KO categories
  between CRC and HC. (B) Correlation network between four bacterial markers and differential
  KO categories between CRC and CA. The correlation was evaluated by Spearman. Circle
  represented KO categories and diamond represented bacterial markers. Red or green
  edges represented negative or positive correlation. Nodes with the same color share
  the same KEGG pathway. Consistently dysregulated pathways between CRC and HC (C)
  or CA (D). The overlapped pathways were marked in red.
