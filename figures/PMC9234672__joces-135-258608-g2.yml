caption: Specific biological processes are enriched during CGNP development. Gene
  ontological analysis shows enriched biological processes in the different CGNP age-specific
  gene clusters. Each node represents a biological process. Related biological processes
  are grouped and labeled by biological theme (curved dashed lines). Individual biological
  processes are assembled in rectangular boxes (dashed lines). Biological processes
  connected by edges have genes in common. Enriched biological processes were determined
  with the Database of Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID),
  v.6.8 (Benjamini-corrected q=0.1, P=0.01) and visualized with the Enrichment Map
  app in Cytoscape. Yellow nodes, E15.5–E17.5 cluster; orange nodes, E15.5–P7 cluster;
  red nodes, P0–P7 cluster; light blue nodes, P14–P30 cluster; dark blue nodes, P14–P30
  cluster. See also Fig. S1 and Table S3.
