caption: Associations between MEK/ERK pathway activity, patient survival, and MEK/ERK
  responder genes’ expression in HGSOC patient samples from TCGA. (A) Cluster analysis
  of phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels in samples from TCGA “PanCancer Atlas” dataset
  (n = 414). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance
  metrics. (B) Kaplan–Meyer analysis of overall patient survival differences between
  three pERK1/2-defined cohorts from TCGA “PanCancer Atlas” dataset (n = 414). Statistical
  significance was evaluated using log-rank tests. (C) Kaplan–Meyer analysis of overall
  patient survival differences between the “High pERK” cohort and combined “Low pERK”+”Moderate
  pERK” cohort from the TCGA “PanCancer Atlas” dataset. Statistical significance was
  evaluated using log-rank test. (D) Expression levels of COMS genes in samples from
  the TCGA “Nature 2011” dataset with available pERK1/2 protein data (n = 337). Boxes
  represent median and quartile values, whiskers represent minimum and maximum values,
  and squares represent sample mean values. Statistical significance was evaluated
  using two-tailed T-test with Welch’s correction.
