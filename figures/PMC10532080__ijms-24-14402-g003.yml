caption: Knockdown of BAP31 suppresses tumorigenesis and stemness of CRC cells in
  vivo. (A) Tumors were harvested and photographed. (B) Growth curves of each group
  of tumors. The indicated numbers of HCT116 cells were inoculated into nude mice
  and tumor volume was measured every 3 days. (C) Each group of tumors was removed
  and weighed. (D) Western blot was used to detect expression of CD44, CD133, Oct4,
  and Nanog in mouse xenografts. (E) BAP31, CD44, and Nanog were evaluated by immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) in mouse xenografts. Scale bar, 100 μm. β-actin was used as loading control.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
