caption: 'RT-PCR analysis of nomilin. (a) TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2 transcripts were analyzed
  using RT-PCR. The level of GAPDH mRNA was used as control. (b) MITF transcripts
  were analyzed using RT-PCR. The level of GAPDH mRNA was used as control. (c) Effects
  of nomilin on tyrosinase, (d) TRP-1, (e) TRP-2, and (f) MITF mRNA in B16F10 cells.
  Data from separate experiments are presented (statistically significant compared
  with the vehicle-treated control, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, bars indicate SD). α-MSH:
  α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, MITF: microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor, TYR: tyrosinase.'
