caption: Butyrate regulates TLR5 expression through the transcription factor Sp3.
  (A) Control siRNA and Sp3-specific siRNA with and without butyrate were transfected
  into HT29 cells. After 48 h, Sp3 mRNA expression and TLR5 mRNA expression (B) were
  detected by RTâ€“qPCR. (C) Western blot analysis and quantification of TLR5 and Sp3
  protein expression after transfection with control siRNA and Sp3-specific siRNA
  in the control and butyrate groups. (D,E) A representative image of Western blot
  analysis. (F) ChIP-sequencing analysis of Sp3 in HT29 cells treated with butyrate.
  ChIP assays with H3 and Sp3 antibodies in butyrate-treated or untreated HT29 cells.
  qPCR showed H3 and Sp3 binding to the TLR5 promoter or RPL30 promoter. * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01.
