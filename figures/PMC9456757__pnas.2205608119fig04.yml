caption: The SCFFBXO5–APC/C–GMNN pathway is a key mediator of CSN5i-3 toxicity. (A)
  CSN5i-3 induces overreplication of DNA. K562 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μM CSN5i-3
  for 1 to 3 d were pulse labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), fixed, stained with
  anti-BrdU and DAPI, and analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry (Upper).
  (Lower) Same as Upper except that cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies
  to phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) to label cells in mitosis, prior to flow cytometry.
  Representative graphs are shown; n ≥ 3. (B) Repression of FBXO5 or GMNN sensitizes
  cells to CSN5i-3. This is the same as in  except that sgRNAs (BFP+; the top-scoring
  one in the original screen; see SI Appendix, Table S3) targeting FBXO5 or GMNN were
  used. Error bars represent ±SD; n = 2 to 3. (C) CSN5i-3 induces degradation of FBXO5
  and GMNN. CHX chase was performed for 0 to 24 h on K562 cells treated with and without
  1 μM CSN5i-3. Error bars represent ±SD; n = 3. (D) GMNN depletion by CSN5i-3 is
  strongly modulated by FBXO5. A total of 1 μM CSN5i-3 was added for 0 to 3 d to unmodified
  K562 cells (wild type [WT]) or K562 cells in which FBXO5 was repressed by CRISPRi
  or overexpressed (o/e; stable integration of cDNA). Representative Western blots
  are shown; n ≥ 2. (E and F) Transgene-driven overexpression and sgRNA-mediated repression
  of FBXO5 or GMNN have opposite effects on induction of apoptosis and overreplication
  by CSN5i-3 in K562 cells. Cells were treated with DMSO or 1 μM CSN5i-3 for 3 d.
  Apoptosis (E) was estimated by measurement of activated Caspase 3. Cell cycle stage/DNA
  content (F) was evaluated as in A. GMNN protein levels in untransfected wild-type,
  repressed, and overexpressed cells are shown by Western blot. Error bars represent
  ±SD; n = 3. (G) FBXO5 knockdown, GMNN knockdown, and CSN5i-3 treatment have similar
  effects on cell cycle profile and overreplication. Cells were treated with siRNA
  against either GMNN or FBXO5 or with 1 µM CSN5i-3 and incubated for 3 d. Cell cycle
  stage and DNA content were evaluated as in A. FBXO5 and GMNN protein levels in HCT116
  cells treated with indicated siRNAs are shown by Western blot. n = 3. (H) Depletion
  of FBXO5 by CSN5i-3 is not dependent on the SCFβ-TrCPpathway. K562 cells were stably
  transfected with constructs that express wild-type FBXO5 or the indicated mutants.
  All three mutants shown lack the phosphodegron bound by SCFβ-TrCP. Transfected cells
  were treated with DMSO, 50 μg/mL CHX, or CHX plus 1 µM CSN5i-3 for 4 h before immunoblotting.
  The asterisk denotes the target bands, and the fast-migrating bands below these
  bands are nonspecific. Representative Western blots are shown; n = 3. (I) Proposed
  mechanism of CSN5i-3 toxicity through the SCFFBXO5–APC/C–GMNN axis.
