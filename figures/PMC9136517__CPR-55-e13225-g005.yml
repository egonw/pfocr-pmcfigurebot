caption: RNA‐Seq analysis uncovers cell cycle genes as the key regulator of Dnmt1
  inhibition during otic development of zebrafish. A, Volcanic plot analysis displays
  all the DEGs in the two groups. B, Venn map further labels the unique and overlapping
  number of DEGs in Con‐MO and Dnmt1‐MO groups. C, KEGG enrichment analysis exhibits
  the top 20 signalling pathways statistically different between Dnmt1 knockdown samples
  and the controls. D, Cluster analysis of DEGs on cell cycle pathway between the
  two groups. E, The ISH data confirm both cdkn1a (p21) and tp53 upregulated after
  knockdown of Dnmt1 compared to controls at 48 hpf
article_title: Dnmt1 is required for the development of auditory organs via cell cycle
  arrest and Fgf signalling.
