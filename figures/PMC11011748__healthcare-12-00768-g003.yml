caption: 'Chronic inflammation and choroid plexus hypoxia. In progressive MS (either
  secondary or primary progressive), inflammation is mild, and neurodegeneration prevails.
  Damage signals from the brain, such as ROS and iNOS, leak through the ependymal
  cells, into the ventricular CSF, towards the choroid plexus. These signals lead
  to oxidative stress, activation of the HIF 1 signaling pathway, and virtual hypoxia
  at the plexus. The BCSFB and the BBB are intact or restored. In response to chronic
  intrathecal inflammation and ROS, the plexus produces cytokines, leading to the
  recruitment of granulocytes and neutrophils, which further contribute to inflammatory
  cytokines secretion. T cells, particularly the CD8 subset, also accumulate in the
  plexus stroma, together with NK cells through the blood–brain barrier, into the
  CSF, towards the periventricular brain tissue. (MS: Multiple Sclerosis, CSF: Cerebrospinal
  Fluid, BCSFB: Blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier, BBB: Blood–brain barrier, NK: Natural
  Killer, CP: Choroid Plexus, ROS: Reactive oxygen species iNOS: Inducible nitric
  oxide synthetase, HIF-1: hypoxia-induced factor 1). Created with BioRender.com.'
