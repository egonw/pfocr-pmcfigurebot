caption: 'The ancestral character of the GDNF-GFRα1-RET signaling pathway during regeneration.
  Left panel: Scar formation is reduced by suppression of inflammation, which is an
  innate feature of animals with high regenerative capacity such as zebrafish and
  axolotls geared towards complete limb/appendage regeneration. Center panels: Phylogenetic
  trees of GDNF and NRTN signaling components using reference sequences from the Protein
  Information Resource (PIR) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
  (NCBI). Unrooted trees were constructed by PHYLIP 3.6 using the input sequences
  with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The scale bar (branch lengths) represents 0.1–1.0
  expected amino acid replacement per site estimated by the PRODIST program of PHYLIP
  3.6 package. Right panel: Model for the ancestral nature of the GDNF signaling pro-regenerative
  pathway. NRTN-GFRα2 may contribute to regenerative inhibition. Human (Homo sapien),
  chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (M. musculus), frog
  (Xenopus laevis), zebrafish (Danio rerio).'
