caption: Proposed pathway depicting the cold stress responses of upland cotton during
  seedling establishment based on integrated morphological, biochemical, and transcriptome
  analyses. The overexpression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  oxidase‐related genes triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation,
  possibly leading to lipid peroxidation and thus malondialdehyde production. Overexpression
  of FAD genes enhances substrate availability for lipid peroxidation. Differential
  regulation of genes for proline biosynthesis via the glutamate and ornithine pathway
  facilitates proline production as a defense mechanism. The downregulation of chlorophyll
  biosynthetic genes and upregulation of abscisic acid synthesis genes controlling
  stomatal movement leads to the cold‐induced morphological changes in stressed seedlings.
  Broken arrow lines lead to products of gene expression
