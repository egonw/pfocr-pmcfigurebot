caption: Chemohormonal therapy activates immune response to suppress xenografted tumors
  growth. A-B. Representative flow plots (A) and densities (B) of intratumoral CD45+
  leukocytes, CD3+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in xenografted tumors of indicated groups.
  C. The distribution of PD1 expression in xenografted tumors of indicated groups.
  The proportion of cells is indicated in the plot. D-E. Representative flow plots
  (D) and densities (E) of CD45+PD1+ cells and CD3+ PD1+ cells in xenografted tumors
  of indicated groups. F. Western blot showing the protein level of PD-L1 in xenografted
  tumors of indicated groups. G. QRT-PCR analysis of cGAS/STING pathway downstream
  immune genes in xenografted tumors of indicated groups. Each point represents an
  independent sample. Data were presented as mean values Â± SEM. Unpaired data were
  analyzed using the t-test or Wilcox rank sum test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***,
  P < 0.001.
