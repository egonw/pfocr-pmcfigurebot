caption: Common pharmacophoric features of the (A) staurosporine inhibitor (violet)
  of PI3K, (B) spirochromane inhibitor (yellow) of AKT1, and (C) superimposed structures
  of the proposed final compounds; hydrophobic features are represented as green contour
  spheres; aromatic features are represented as orange contour spheres, and HB_A features
  are represented as turquoise contour spheres. Additional HB_A features in the proposed
  compounds are represented as turquoise solid spheres.
