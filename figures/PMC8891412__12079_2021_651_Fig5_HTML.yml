caption: Relationships between the risk score and clinicopathologic factors. a The
  outcome prediction of the hypoxia-related lncRNA signature in patients stratified
  by age, grade, stage, surgical approach and radiation therapy in TCGA cohort. b–e
  The outcome (b, c) and expression (d, e) in different age (≤ 60 and > 60), grade
  (G1–G2 and G3–G4), stage (I–II and III–IV), surgical approach (minimally invasive
  and open) and radiation therapy (No and Yes) group were analyzed
