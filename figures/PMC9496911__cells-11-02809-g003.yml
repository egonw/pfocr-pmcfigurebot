caption: Melatonin can promote the activation of Nrf2/ARE-related proteins and inhibit
  the NLRP3 inflammasome in the spinal cord tissue near the injury site of mice 3
  days after SCI. (A–D) The protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 in the spinal
  cord tissue near the injury site in each group was assessed by Western blotting
  (n = 6). (E–I) The protein expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β in the
  spinal cord tissue near the injury site was detected by Western blotting (n = 6).
  Data are shown as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
