figure_title: β-Catenin promotes the long-term survival of engrafted PBMSCs in ischemic
  hearts via the Oct4-related antiapoptotic pathway
caption: 'PBMSCs were infected with a reporter retrovirus expressing EGFP before transplantation
  and were recognized as EGFP-positive cells. a Representative fluorescence microscopy
  images of tissue sections showing the retention of EGFP (green)-labeled PBMSCs at
  the injection site at 90 days after transplantation. Scale bar: 50 μm. b Heart tissues
  were immunostained for EGFP-PBMSCs (green) and the cardiomyocyte marker troponin
  T (red) to verify the retention of transplanted PBMSCs and were counterstained with
  DAPI to detect the nuclei. Overexpression of β-catenin/Oct4 markedly improved the
  initial retention of donor PBMSCs compared with that in vector control cells, whereas
  shβ-catenin or shOct4 decreased the retention of transplanted PBMSCs. Scale bar,
  50 μm. c Representative phenotype of gated EGFP+ cells evaluated by FACS. d Representative
  double TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase UTP nick-end labeling) staining
  for apoptotic PBMSCs in the infarcted tissues. EGFP+ cells are shown as green. The
  red fluorescence represents apoptotic cells. Merged images indicate the apoptosis
  of transplanted PBMSCs. Note that more EGFP-labeled PBMSCs were apoptotic in the
  infarcted hearts receiving shβ-catenin or shOct4, as revealed by the presence of
  cells costained with TUNEL staining (red) and EGFP (green); 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI) was used as a nuclear marker. Scale bar, 50 μm. e Quantitative data showing
  the retention of EGFP+ PBMSCs in the ischemic hearts. f Quantitative analysis of
  the percentages of EGFP-positive cells (EGFP+) relative to the whole ventricular
  cell population in the ischemic hearts after 90 days of transplantation using FACS.
  g Quantification of the apoptosis of transplanted PBMSCs in the infarcted tissues
  using the TUNEL assay. All graphs show the means ± SEMs. p < 0.05: *vs. PBS injection,
  #vs. PBMSC therapy alone, Δvs. transplantation of PBMSCs transfected with oeβ-catenin,
  oeOct4-, or shβ-catenin plus oeOct4, †vs. transplantation of PBMSCs transfected
  with oeβ-catenin plus shOct4 or shβ-catenin alone (n = 5 per group). h Quantitative
  analysis of the mRNA expression of β-catenin, Oct4, Bcl2, Birc5 (encoding survivin),
  Bax, and Casp3 (caspase-3). i Representative immunoblots of these molecules. P < 0.05:
  *vs. PBS injection, #vs. PBMSC therapy alone, Δvs. transplantation of oeβ-catenin-treated
  MSCs, †vs. transplantation of PBMSCs transfected with oeβ-catenin plus shOct4, §vs.
  transplantation of PBMSCs transfected with shβ-catenin alone (n = 5 per group).'
