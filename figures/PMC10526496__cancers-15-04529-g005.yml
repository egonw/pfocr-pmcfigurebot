caption: Metformin suppresses the DPP-4 inhibition-induced mTOR/HIF-1α/autophagy axis
  in 4T1 mammary tumors. (A). Western blot analysis of p-mTOR, HIF-1α, LC3, and p62
  in 4T1 cells treated with KR62436 (KR, 50 μM), and/or metformin (10 mM) for 48 h.
  Densitometric analysis of protein levels relative to β-actin or LC3I levels (n =
  3–5 per group). (B,C). Immunohistochemistry of primary mammary tumors for p62 (B)
  and apoptotic marker TUNEL staining (C) following PBS (control), KR (20 mg/kg/day,
  oral injection), metformin (200 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injection), or KR and
  metformin treatment for 7 days (n = 3 each group). Scale bars, 50 μm. Error bars
  represent the mean ± SEM. NS, not significant. (D) Schematic model of how metformin
  mitigates DPP-4 inhibitor-induced breast cancer cell survival.
