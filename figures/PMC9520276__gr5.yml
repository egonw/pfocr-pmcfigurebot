caption: BNIP3-mediated mitophagy activation decreases mtDNA release and STING-NLRP3
  activation in Xbp1-deficient macrophages.(A) Western blot was performed to examine
  intracellular BNIP3, LC3B, and p62 protein levels in LPS-stimulated Xbp1M-KO BMDMs
  transfected with SCR-siRNA or Bnip3-siRNA. Statistical analysis was carried out
  using the Student t test. (B) Autophagic microstructures in mitochondria in LPS-stimulated
  Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with SCR-siRNA or Bnip3-siRNA were examined by transmission
  electron microscopy, 5,000 × magnification; scale bars, 2 μm. Arrowheads, mitophagy.
  (C) The levels of ROS in LPS-stimulated Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with SCR-siRNA
  or Bnip3-siRNA were examined by DCFH-DA (original magnification 200 × ). (D) Relative
  total mtDNA amounts in LPS-stimulated Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with SCR-siRNA
  or Bnip3-siRNA were determined using qPCR with primers specific for mtDNA (D-loop)
  and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3 biological replicates/group; Student t test. (E) mtDNA
  released from mitochondria in Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with SCR-siRNA or Bnip3-siRNA,
  as shown by confocal microscopy. Arrowheads, mtDNA released into cytoplasm. (F)
  The mitochondrial membrane potential of Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with SCR-siRNA
  or Bnip3-siRNA was determined by TMRM staining. (G) The levels of ROS in LPS-stimulated
  Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs treated with PBS or MitoTEMPO were examined using DCFH-DA (original
  magnification 200 × ). (H) Relative amounts of total cytosolic mtDNA in LPS-stimulated
  Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs treated with PBS or MitoTEMPO were determined using qPCR with primers
  specific for mtDNA (D-loop) and nuclear DNA (Tert); n = 3 biological replicates/group;
  Student t test. (I) Schematic showing the administration protocol for mannose-conjugated
  SCR-siRNA and Bnip3-siRNA in CCl4-, BDL-, and MCD-induced murine liver fibrosis
  models for the experiments shown in (J). (J) Xbp1M-KO male mice were subjected to
  CCl4-, BDL-, or MCD-induced experimental fibrosis and injected with SCR-siRNA or
  Bnip3-siRNA via the tail vein, and the collected livers were subjected to H&E and
  Sirius Red staining and α-SMA immunohistochemical analysis; scale bar=100 μm. Representative
  of 6 mice/group. (K) The proportions of the Sirius Red- and α-SMA-positive areas
  were quantified; n = 6 mice/group; 1-way ANOVA. The values are shown as mean ± SD.
  Statistical significance was assessed by Student t test or ANOVA. ∗∗p <0.01. BMDMs,
