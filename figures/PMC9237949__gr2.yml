caption: A phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships among existing
  and new sub-models of the pathway. We consider three distinct levels of models.
  Level 1 modules are created from models of components of the signalling pathways
  that already exist in the literature. Level 2 modules are small connected components
  of the signalling pathway that determined by the availability of experimental data
  which allows the parameters of the modules to be define. Level 3 combined all sub-models
  together to create a whole model. Sub-models highlighted in green boxes mean experimental
  data exists.
