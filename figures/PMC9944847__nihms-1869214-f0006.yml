figure_title: Cers4 was a MYC target gene in the intestine
caption: a–c, mRNA levels of genes involved in the de novo pathway (a), sphingomyelinase
  pathway (b) and salvage pathway (c) of ceramide synthesis in the intestinal organoids
  isolated from Mycfl/+ and MycΔIE/+ mice fed a HFD for 2 weeks; n = 3. d–f, mRNA
  levels of genes involved in the de novo pathway (d), sphingomyelinase pathway (e)
  and salvage pathway (f) of ceramide synthesis in the intestinal organoids isolated
  from Mycfl/+ mice fed a HFD for 2 weeks and treated with vehicle or 40 μM 10058-F4
  for 24 h; n = 3. g, mRNA levels of CERS4 in ileum biopsies from individuals with
  obesity (n = 16) or without obesity (n = 28). h, Correlation of CERS4 mRNA levels
  with BMI; n = 44. i, Correlation of CERS4 mRNA levels with serum ALT levels; n =
  44. j, Correlation of CERS4 and MYC mRNA levels; n = 44. k, Protein levels of CERS4
  in the intestinal organoids isolated from Mycfl/+ and MycΔIE/+ mice fed a HFD for
  2 weeks and treated with vehicle or 40 μM 10058-F4 for 48 h. l, Protein levels of
  CERS4 in the intestines of Mycfl/+ and MycΔIE/+ mice fed a HFD for 2 weeks. m, Schematic
  of the mouse Cers4 promoter (−4.5 kb) illustrating the predicted Ebox sites in the
  regulatory region and the fragments used for luciferase reporter assays. n, Luciferase
  reporter assay of mouse Cers4 promoter activity; n = 3. o,p, ChIP assay with MC38
  cells transfected with empty backbone or MyC overexpression plasmid and treated
  with vehicle or 40 μM 10058-F4 for 48 h; n = 3 for α-MyC and IgG groups; n = 1 for
  α-H3 group. All data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. of biologically independent
  samples, analysed using two-tailed Student’s t-test (a–g), non-parametric Spearman’s
  test (h–j) or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test (n–p).
