caption: Influence of MBE and GE on antioxidant signaling pathway. Western blot was
  performed to detect the protein expression levels of p-Nrf2 and SOD1 in the co-culture
  system by day 7. (a) Representative Western blot image showing the protein levels
  of p-Nrf2 and SOD1 among different groups. The levels of p-Nrf2 (b) and SOD1 proteins
  (c) were measured in the co-culture system on day 7. Statistical differences were
  determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison
  test. Data are presented as means ± SEM, and the significance is shown as * p <
  0.05 vs. CSE group. N = 3, n = 2.
