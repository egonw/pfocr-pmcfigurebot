caption: R loop is involved in ATR/Chk1 pathway activation by ADAR1 deficiency. (A)
  The representative microphotographs showed immunostaining of DNA/RNA hybrid (S9.6
  antibody) in SKOV3 and A2780 with or without ADAR1 silence. Scale bar, 20 µm. (B)
  Quantification of mean intensity of DNA/RNA hybrid in (A). All data were shown as
  mean ± SD in n > 90 cells (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05). (C) Diagram
  of the β-actin and RPL13A locus depicting relative position of primer pairs used
  for DRIP-qPCR. Exons are depicted as black boxes. (D) DRIP-qPCR were performed using
  primers to the indicated regions of the β-actin and RPL13A in SKOV3 cells with or
  without ADAR1 silence (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05). (E) Quantification
  of mean intensity of DNA/RNA shRNA were transfected with an empty vector or the
  RNaseH1 expression plasmid (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05). (F) Phosphorylation
  of Chk1 and H2A.X were detected via Western blot in ADAR1 knockdown cells. ADAR1
  knockdown cells were transfected with an empty vector or the RNaseH1 expression
  plasmid.
