figure_title: Differential gene expression induced by single-agent or combination
  treatments in vivo
caption: 'All treatments were administered for 7 consecutive days, and samples were
  collected after the last dose.a, Venn diagram showing the overlap of upregulated
  (top) or downregulated (bottom) differentially expressed genes in the KRASG12C-mutant
  non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model (NCI-H2122) xenograft models treated
  with adagrasib (100 mg/kg) alone or combined with BI-3406 (50 mg/kg) or TNO155 (10
  mg/kg). b, Modulation of overall MAPK pathway activity, as indicated by the MAPK
  Pathway Activity Score (MPAS), in NCI-H2122 xenograft models treated with indicated
  monotherapies or combination treatments at 4 or 48 hours post-last doses. N=2–3.
  Boxplots show low and upper quartiles and median line is indicates. Whiskers: 1.5
  x interquartile range. Data analyzed by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. c, Differential
  modulation of select MAPK pathway genes in NCI-H2122 xenograft models treated with
  indicated single-agent or combination treatments. Samples were collected at 4 or
  48 hours post last dose. d, (top) Percentage of positive tumor cells expressing
  DUSP6 or EGR1 mRNA analyzed by RNAscope in F3008 colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived
  xenograft (PDX) models treated with vehicle, adagrasib (100mpk, QD), adagrasib plus
  BI-3406 (50mpk, BID), or adagrasib plus cetuximab (15mpk, twice weekly) for 5 days.
  Tumors were collected 4 hours after the last dose. N=5/group. Boxplots show low
  and upper quartiles and median line is indicates. Whiskers: 1.5 x interquartile
  range. Data analyzed by two-sided Student’s t-test, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. (bottom)
  Representative images from multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of DUSP6 and EGR1
  in tumor tissue from models described in (top). Scale bar = 100 µm. e, Gene set
  enrichment analysis heatmaps show differentially modulated pathways in NCI-H2122
  xenograft models treated with indicated single-agent or combination therapies. f,
  (top) Percentage of positive tumor cells expressing phospho-ERK as analyzed by multiplex
  immunofluorescence in the same tumor tissues as described in d. N=5/group. Boxplots
  show low and upper quartiles and median line is indicates. Whiskers: 1.5 x interquartile
  range. Comparisons to vehicle analyzed by two-sided Student’s t-test; **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001. (bottom) Representative images from multiplex immunofluorescence analysis
  of p-ERK and HLA in tumor tissue from models described in (top). Scale bar = 100
  µm.'
