caption: 'Artemisinin decreased ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral infarction and
  brain water content (A) Brain infarct volume was measured 24 hours after MCAO treatment
  with different doses of artemisinin (2, 6, 18 mg/kg) and the representative pictures
  of the TTC staining were shown. (B) Quantification of the infarction volume of A.
  (C) Brain infarct volume was measured at different time points of artemisinin treatment
  after ischemia (eg. Ischemia 0 h means artemisinin treatment 1 hour before reperfusion;
  Ischemia 1 h means artemisinin treatment while reperfusion; Ischemia 2 h means artemisinin
  treatment 1 h after reperfusion.) (D) Quantification of the infarction volume of
  C. (E) The brain water content was measured 24 hours after MCAO treatment with artemisinin
  (6 mg/kg). ***p < 0.001, versus ctrl group; ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, versus model
  group were considered significantly different. The assay was repeated at least 3
  times.'
