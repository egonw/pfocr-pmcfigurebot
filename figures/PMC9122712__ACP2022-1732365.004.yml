caption: Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of OC cells by targeting FSCN1. (a) RT-qPCR was used to detect the growth of OC
  cells after cotransfection of miR-585-3p mimic and FSCN1. (b) Scratch wound healing
  assays was used to detect the lateral migration ability of OC cells after cotransfection
  of miR-585-3p mimic and FSCN1. (c) Transwell assay was used to detect the invasive
  ability of OC cells after cotransfection of miR-585-3p mimic and FSCN1. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
