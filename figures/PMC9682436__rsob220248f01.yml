caption: Key metabolic pathways for neutrophil activation. Glycolysis is the major
  metabolic pathway in neutrophils. Glucose gets inside the cell through GLUT. Once
  in the cytoplasm, glucose is rapidly phosphorylated to G6P, that is ultimately converted
  into lactate. G6P can also fuel the PPP to provide NADPH, which is important for
  some neutrophil functions. Glucose can be stored as glycogen in neutrophil cytoplasm,
  which is metabolized to glucose to sustain neutrophil function when low glucose
  is available in the environment. Mitochondrial metabolism is especially important
  during neutrophils differentiation, as will be discussed further in this review.
  GLUT, glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; G6PD, G6P dehydrogenase; 6PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactone; 6PGA,
  6-phosphogluconate; ribu-5-P, ribulose-5-phosphate; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  FFA, free fat acid.
