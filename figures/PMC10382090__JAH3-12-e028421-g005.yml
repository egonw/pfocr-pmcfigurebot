figure_title: Role of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) activation in mediating increased
  aortic stiffness elicited by high‐salt intake or aging
caption: This schematic diagram illustrates key steps in the signaling pathway linking
  A2AR activation with increased aortic stiffness. According to this model, high‐salt
  intake or aging increases extracellular levels of adenosine which activate A2ARs
  on VSMCs. Stimulation of A2ARs triggers dissociation of trax from its C‐terminus
  enabling trax to bind to translin to form active translin/trax complexes. Enhancing
  translin/trax RNase activity triggers degradation of its substrate, pre‐miR‐181b,
  and prevents its conversion into mature microRNA‐181b by Dicer. Decreased silencing
  of mRNAs targeted by microRNA‐181b leads to increased extracellular levels of TGF‐β,
  which, in turn, drives aortic stiffening. miR indicates microRNA; pre‐miR, premature
  microRNA; and VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells.
