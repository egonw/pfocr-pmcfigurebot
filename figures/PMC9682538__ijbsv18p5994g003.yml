caption: M2 macrophage contact activates EMT signaling in PCa cells. (A) GSEA showed
  that M2 macrophages direct contact promoted EMT-related gene enrichment in DU145-luc
  and 22RV1-luc cells. (B) Western blot assay of EMT signaling-related protein expression.
  TAMs (THP-1 and PBMC-derived) directly contacted increased N-cadherin, vimentin,
  and Snail and decreased E-cadherin expression in DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared
  with the noncontact and control groups. (C) Immunofluorescence assays showed that
  TAMs in direct contact increased N1ICD (far red) and vimentin (green) expression
  of DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc compared with the noncontact and control groups. (Scale
  bar=50 µm). (D) Western blot assay detected γ-secretase component protein expression.
  M2 macrophages (THP-1 and PBMC-derived) directly contact increases Nicastrin, PEN2,
  Presenilin1 and Presenilin2 expression in DU145-luc and 22RV1-luc cells compared
  with the noncontact and control groups.
