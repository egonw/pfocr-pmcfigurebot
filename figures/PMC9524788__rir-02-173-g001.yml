caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS activity can be negatively regulated
  via phosphorylation of Serine 291 by CDK1 and AKT, triggering sequestration of cGAS
  to histone. cGAS binding to PIP2 also restricts its ability to interact with and
  sense free cytosolic DNA. Untethered cGAS may freely bind cytosolic viral, mitochondrial,
  bacterial, or damaged nuclear DNA and form homodimers to generate cGAMP. cGAMP generated
  this way or transported into the cytosol via transporter proteins SLC19A1, P2RX7,
  or LRRC8A:C bind to and activate STING, which then homodimerizes and translocates
  to the Golgi. cGAMP-bound STING homodimers recruit TBK1, which drives STING phosphorylation
  at Serine 366 to initiate IRF3 and IKK/NFκB phosphorylation, nuclear translocation,
  and transcription of the interferon-driven immune response. AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; cGAMP, 2′3′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP); cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; IFN, interferon; IRF3, IFN response
  factor 3; IKK, IκB kinase; LRRC8A:C, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A:C;
  NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; P2RX7, P2X
  purinoceptor 7; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol; STING, stimulator of IFN genes; TBK1,
  tank-binding kinase 1. Figure created with Biorender.com.
