caption: miR-146a-5p shows an upregulation in cervical cancer and exerts promotive
  effects on metastasis of cervical cancer cells. (a) The heat map of differentially
  expressed miRNAs in microarray GSE86100. Each row represents a differentially expressed
  miRNA, and each column represents a sample. (b) The volcano map of differentially
  expressed miRNAs in microarray GSE86100, where the red dots indicate upregulated
  miRNAs and the green dots indicate downregulated miRNAs. (c) The heat map of top
  10 upregulated miRNAs in microarray GSE86100. (d) The expression of miR-146-5p in
  microarray GSE30656. (e) RT-qPCR determination of miR-146a-5p expression in 30 cases
  of human cervical cancer tissues and 30 cases of normal cervical tissues. (f) RT-qPCR
  determination of the expression of miR-146a-5p in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa,
  CaSki, SiHa, and C33A) and normal cervical epithelial cell lines (End1/E6E7 and
  HcerEpic). (g) RT-qPCR determination of the expression of miR-146a-5p in C33A cells
  after transfection. (h) Transwell assay of the invasion and migration of C33A cells
  after miR-146a-5p mimic or inhibitor transfection. (i) The adhesion of C33A cells
  to the extracellular matrix after miR-146a-5p mimic or inhibitor transfection. (j)
  The apoptosis of C33A cells after miR-146a-5p mimic or inhibitor transfection assessed
  by TUNEL staining. (k) Western blot assay of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin
  protein expression in C33A cells after miR-146a-5p mimic or inhibitor transfection.
  The data in the Figure were measurement data and expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
  The data between two groups were analyzed by unpaired t-test, and the comparison
  among multiple groups was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (Dunnett's
  post hoc test). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. Cell experiments were repeated 3 times independently.
