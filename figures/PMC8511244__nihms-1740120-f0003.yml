caption: 'Schematic figures of metabolic alterations in HCC. Glycolysis and pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) were increased while the urea cycle, TCA cycle, and Î²-oxidation
  are decreased in the liver cancer cells. Fatty acid (FA) synthesis and uptake are
  gradually increased until HCC development. Glutamate produced during glutaminolysis
  serves as the major substrate to refuel the TCA cycle. Abbreviations: PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; FA, fatty acid; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
