caption: 'CaSR activates mTORC1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) CaSR stimulates S6 phosphorylation.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated for 10 min with R568 + calcium at the indicated
  times. EGF was used as positive control. Total cell lysates were utilized for western
  blot analysis to reveal S6 phosphorylation, normalized to non-stimulated cells (NS)
  which was considered 100%. Bars indicate mean ± standard deviation (SD), *p = 0.0190;
  (Student t test; n = 3). (B) NPS-2143 calcilytic inhibits CaSR-dependent S6 phosphorylation
  in MDA-MB231. *p = 0.0247, #p = 0.0141, ##p = 0.0076; data was analyzed by one-way
  ANOVA followed by uncorrected Fisher; (n = 3). (C) Effect of Gallein on S6 phosphorylation
  stimulated by R568 + calcium. Error bars indicate SD, **p = 0.0096, #p = 0.0241;
  (unpaired Student t test; n = 3). (D) Effect of wortmannin (Wm) on S6 phosphorylation
  stimulated by CaSR in MDA-MB-231 cells. Error bars indicate SD, * p = 0.04; (one-way
  ANOVA followed by Bonferroni; n = 3). (E) Effect of rapamycin on CaSR-induced S6
  phosphorylation in MDA-MB231 cells. Bars represent mean ± SD, **p = 0.01, ###p < 0.001;
  (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey; n = 3)'
