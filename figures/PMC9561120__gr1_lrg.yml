caption: CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway. The ligation of CCL2 to CCR2 can activate various
  signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK and NFKB, which finally induces the expression
  of various genes by activating transcription factors, leading to cell proliferation,
  migration of immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages, expression of inflammatory
  mediators, and hyperinflammation.
