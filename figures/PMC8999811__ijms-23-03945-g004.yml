caption: 'Multi-functional role of jasmonic acid (JA) interaction module in stress.
  (A) JA-ET-SA network modulates the defense against pathogens in Arabidopsis. JA
  and ET synergistically regulate the defense against necrotrophic pathogens. BIG
  gene positively/negatively regulates MYC2/ERF1 and coordinates the defense of plants
  against pathogens and insects. NACs transcription factors in the JA pathway and
  SA pathway antagonize the regulation of stomatal dynamics and defense response against
  P. syringae. (B) JA defense against herbivorous insects through physical (blue)
  and chemical (orange) means. JA promotes the accumulation of GS (defense against
  Spodoptera littoralis/Spider mite), ROS/H2O2 (defense against brown planthopper),
  TrypPI/POD/PPO (defense against Cnaphalocrocis medinalis), and PIs/PPO (defense
  against Thrips/Helicoverpa armigera), as well as the initiation of trichomes to
  defend against a variety of herbivorous insects. (C) JA-BR-ABA crosstalk-regulated
  defense response to viruses. JA and BR synergistically defend against RSV through
  MYC2/BZR1. ABA antagonistically regulates the defense response to RBSDV by inhibiting
  the production of ROS and the synthesis of JA. Arrows: Activations; Bar-headed arrows:
  Repressions. JA and ET are two crucial plant hormones that co-operate to activate
  defenses against necrotrophic pathogens, whereas the SA pathway triggers defenses
  against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens.'
