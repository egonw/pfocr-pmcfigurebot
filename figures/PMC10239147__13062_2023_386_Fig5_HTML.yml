caption: LINC01003 knockdown represses glioma growth in vivo. A A subcutaneous xenograft
  tumor model was generated by transfecting U87MG cells with shNC or shLINC01003.
  Tumors were removed from the nude mice and photographed at the end of experiment.
  B Once the mice were injected with the cells, he tumor volume in nude mice was measured
  every 5 days. The volume curves were plotted from day 5 to day 30. C Quantification
  of tumor weight in nude mice from (A). D RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression
  of LINC01003 in the tumors from nude mice. E Western blot was used to detect the
  expression levels of p-FAK and CAV1 in the tumors from nude mice. Data represent
  the mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
article_title: m6A-mediated upregulation of LINC01003 regulates cell migration by
  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
