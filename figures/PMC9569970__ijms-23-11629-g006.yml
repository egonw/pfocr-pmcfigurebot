caption: Activity of glycolytic enzymes and lactate tracing with [13C2-1,2]glucose.
  (A) Diagram depicting [13C2-1,2]glucose metabolism through glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and the resulting labeling patterns of key intermediates
  and lactate. Glycolysis will result in the formation of one molecule each of [13C2-2,3]lactate
  and [12C3]lactate from one molecule of [13C2-1,2]glucose, while the PPP will convert
  three molecules of [13C2-1,2]glucose into one molecule each of [13C2-1,3]lactate
  and [13C1-3]lactate and three molecules of [12C3]lactate. The relative abundances
  of PPP-derived [13C1-3]lactate (lactate m + 1) and glycolytic [13C2-2,3]lactate
  (lactate m + 2) provide estimates of PPP and glycolytic activity, respectively.
  Key enzymes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are depicted in the
  graph. G6P = glucose 6-phosphate; X5P = xylulose 5-phosphate; G6PDH = glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; E4P = erythrose 4-phosphate; F6P = fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6BP =
  fructose 1,6 bis-phosphate; GAP= glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Red filled circles
  denote carbon 13, black unfilled circles denote carbon 12. (B) Hexokinase activity
  was significantly lower in proneural BTIC-8 and -18 than mesenchymal BTIC-11 and
  -13, while (C) the opposite applied to G6PDH activity. (D) Phosphofructosekinase
  activity corresponded partly to hexokinase activity. (E) The proneural BTIC-18 contained
  significantly more PPP-derived [13C1-3]lactate (lactate m + 1, lactate derivative
  containing only C2 to C3) than the mesenchymal BTICs-11 and -13. Treatment with
  1 mM metformin led to a significant drop in PPP-derived [13C1-3]lactate in BTIC-11
  and BTIC-13. (F) The relative content of glycolytic [13C2-2,3]lactate (lactate m
  + 2, lactate derivative containing only C2 to C3) was increased in BTIC-13, albeit
  not significantly, as compared to BTIC-11 and -18. Treatment with 1 mM metformin
  resulted in a relative, albeit not significant increase in [13C2-2,3]lactate in
  BTIC-11. Utilization of [13C2-1,2]glucose via the PPP leads to the formation of
  (G) [13C1-3]pyruvate and (I) [13C1-3]lactate, whose m/z values increase by +1 unit
  in comparison to [12C3]pyruvate and [12C3-3]lactate. Utilization of [13C2-1,2]glucose
  via glycolysis results in double labeled (m + 2) (H) [13C2-2,3]pyruvate and (J)
  [13C2-2,3]lactate. Hence, a higher fraction of m + 1 pyruvate or lactate isotopologues
  indicates increased PPP activity. All assays were performed in triplicate. Asterisks
  indicate * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001.
