caption: TRIM22 expression levels are increased in RA-FLSs. (A) TRIM22 gene expression
  levels were examined in synovial membrane samples of patients with RA and normal
  synovial membrane samples using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. TRIM22 mRNA
  and protein expression levels in RA-FLSs and normal-FLSs were determined using (B)
  RT-qPCR and (C) western blotting. ***P<0.001. si-TRIM22#1/2 transfection efficiency
  was analyzed using (D) RT-qPCR and (E) western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. si-NC. TRIM22,
  tripartite motif-containing 22; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; FLS, fibroblast-like synoviocyte;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; si, small interfering RNA; NC,
  negative control.

  of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.
