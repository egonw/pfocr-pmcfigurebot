caption: Gene expression analysis of secondary metabolic pathway upon SA treatment.
  (a) Gene expression analysis of “Metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides”. (b)
  Gene expression analysis of “Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites”. (c) qRT-PCR
  verification of changes in gene expression of “Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites”.
  Results are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3). Data are the mean of three independent
  measurements ± the standard deviation indicated by the error bars, * p < 0.05 and
  ** p < 0.01 using the one-way ANOVA test.
