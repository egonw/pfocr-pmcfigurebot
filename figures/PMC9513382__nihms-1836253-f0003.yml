figure_title: SerpinB3 regulates known CSC pathways
caption: (A) RNA was isolated after SerpinB3 knockdown in T4121 cells, and qPCR was
  performed for SERPINB3, OCT4, NANOG, OLIG2, MYC, and TGF-β1 (3 technical replicates).(B)
  Tumor cells were plated in a limiting-dilution manner, and the number of wells containing
  spheres was counted after 14 days and used to calculate stem cell frequencies using
  the online algorithm detailed in the methods. N = 12 wells per dilution.(C) c-MYC
  expression after SerpinB3 knockdown was assessed via western blot, with actin as
  a loading control.(D) TGF-β1 secretion was analyzed 2 days after plating and normalized
  to total protein (3 technical replicates per condition, per tumor model).(E) NanoString
  pathway score comparing SerpinB3 knockdown to non-target control. Bolded rows represent
  pathways known to regulate the CSC state.(F) Immunofluorescence staining of T4121
  CSCs for SerpinB3 and SOX2. Scale bar represents 10 μM.p < 0.05 was considered statistically
  significant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, as determined by 1-way ANOVA with
  Dunnett’s multiple comparisons, Student’s t test for qPCR data, or chi-squared p
  value for limiting dilution assay. Error bars represent standard deviations.
