caption: The angiogenic switch does not depend on HIF-1 signaling. a Schematics indicating
  the microsurgery of dissecting the transplant microtumors and transcriptome sequencing.
  Avascular, the tumor has not yet induced angiogenesis, which means ‘angiogenic switch’
  is off (about 12 h); First vessel, the tumor induces the sprouting of the first
  vessel, which means ‘angiogenic switch’ is on (about 24 h). b The volcano plot of
  the gene expression change of the dissected transplant microtumors transcriptome
  during the angiogenic switch (n = 3). c The GSEA analysis and d the heat map of
  the HIF-1 signaling pathway during the angiogenic switch (n = 3). e and f The change
  of FPKM value of RNAseq data for Car9/CA9 and Slc2a1/GLUT1
