figure_title: Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR)-dependent and -independent transcriptomic
  changes in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induced by B-ALL
caption: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) distribution plot. (B) Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering and heatmap representation of top 1000 differentially expressed
  genes. (C) GSEA-KEGG pathway alterations in MSCs. (D) Hematopoietic cytokines and
  chemokine mRNA expression. Data in all panels were generated from analyses of MSC
  bulk RNA sequencing. *p<0.05; **p<0.005; unpaired, two-sided, Student’s t test.
  ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
