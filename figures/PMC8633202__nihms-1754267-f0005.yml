figure_title: Metabolomic analysis of brain metabolites in response to a high fat
  diet in the absence and presence of EPA ethyl esters
caption: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of brain samples generated from metabolites
  detected in at least 2 brain samples showing distribution of samples for control
  (red squares), high fat (blue circles), and high fat + EPA (yellow triangles) diets.
  Colored circles around each of the three groups are the 95% confidence ellipses
  showing that variances in sample data is not due to treatment. (B) Hierarchical
  clustering (HC) of the samples, y axis, (red = control, blue = high fat, yellow
  = high fat + EPA) and detected metabolites, x axis. Each metabolite is represented
  by a line and its color represents the median abundance on a log2 transformed scale,
  either yellow (0 = median), red (above the median to 11.7), or blue (below the median
  to âˆ’11.7). No treatment specific clustering was observed in either the PCA or HC.
