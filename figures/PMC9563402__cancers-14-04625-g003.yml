caption: (1) Simultaneous inhibition of ERK and farnesyltransferase inhibits the growth
  of HRAS-mutated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and tipifarnib is currently
  being rapidly designated by the FDA for the treatment of HNSCC with HRA mutations.
  (2) Cetuximab is effective for the treatment of KRAS mutant types of HNSCC. (3)
  MAPK1 mutations can be targeted by EGFR inhibitors. (4) Glaucocytoma with BRAF p.V600E
  mutation is more sensitive to BRAF monotherapy or BRAF/MEK combination therapy.
  (5) Combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 promoted rapid tumor regression. (6) CD8+
  T cell infiltration in MAPK mutant HNSCC may be an indicator of anti-PD-1 /PD-L1
  inhibitor therapy.
