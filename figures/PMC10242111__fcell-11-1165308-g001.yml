caption: '(A) Timeline of patient’s leukemia medical history (Dg, diagnosis; ALLO,
  allogeneic transplantation; MRD, minimal residual disease; CR, complete response;
  Rel, relapse; DLI, donor lymphocyte infusion; RT, radiotherapy; BLINA, blinatunomab;
  INO, inotuzomab ozogamicin; PET PR, partial response; VEN, venetoclax; “Stars” indicate
  the four analyzed time points (1: extramedullary relapse #1—Dec/2018; 2: third relapse
  #2—Jan/2019; 3: post-inotuzomab ozogamicin hematological remission #4—Jun/2019;
  4: post-venetoclax remission—Jul/2021). (B) Whole-body (upper panel) and axial scan
  (lower panel) 18F-FDG PET at four time points: at relapse, in December 2018 (i);
  after six cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by radiotherapy, in November
  2019 (ii); after 6 months of treatment with venetoclax, in July 2020 (iii), and
  after 27 months of treatment with venetoclax and four DLIs, in April 2022 (iv).
  (C) 18F-FDG PET images (axial scan) at four time points showing i) inguinal pelvic
  mass at relapse - SUV 9.5 (December 2018); ii) partial resolution—SUV 2.9/Deuville
  3 (November 2019) reached after treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and radiotherapy;
  iii) complete resolution—SUV 1.8 (July 2020—Deuville 1) after 6 months of venetoclax,
  and iv) after 27 months of continuative treatment with venetoclax and four DLIs—SUV
  1.4 (April 2022—Deuville 1).'
