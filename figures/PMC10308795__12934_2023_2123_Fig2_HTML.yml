caption: 'Metabolic pathway from pyruvate to 3-HP through cytosolic acetyl-CoA and
  malonyl-CoA in P. pastoris. The reactions catalysed by all the enzymes linked to
  overexpressed or deleted genes are displayed. Enzyme abbreviations: Pdc1: Pyruvate
  decarboxylase 1; Ald: Endogenous cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase; ACSSeL641P: Acetyl-CoA
  synthase from Salmonella enterica harbouring the point mutation L641P to avoid post-translational
  inhibition of the enzyme by acetylation; Acc1Yl: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Y.
  lipolytica; MCR-CCa: C-terminal domain of the malonyl-CoA reductase from C. aurantiacus;
  MCR-NCa: N-terminal domain of the malonyl-CoA reductase from C. aurantiacus; cPos5Sc:
  NADH kinase from S. cerevisiae located on the cytosol; ArDH: Arabitol dehydrogenase.
  Green and red arrows and enzyme abbreviations indicate whether the corresponding
  genes were overexpressed or deleted, respectively'
article_title: High throughput 13C-metabolic flux analysis of 3-hydroxypropionic acid
  producing Pichia pastoris reveals limited availability of acetyl-CoA and ATP due
  to tight control of the glycolytic flux.
