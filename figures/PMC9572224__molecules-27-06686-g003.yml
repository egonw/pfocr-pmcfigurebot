caption: The effect of andrographolide in reducing colony formation of DBTRG-05MG
  cell lines. (A) Colony formation of DBTRG-05MG cells treated with 13.95 μM andrographolide
  and without andrographolide as the control. (B) The percentage of surviving fraction
  of DBTRG-05MG cell lines when treated with 13.95 μM and 27.9 μM of andrographolide
  compared with a control group. The comparison between each treatment with control
  was made using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test to detect any significant differences
  (*** p > 0.001).
