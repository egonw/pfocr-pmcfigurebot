caption: Proposed AMH-mediated developmental drive of brain circuit abnormalities
  leading to the manifestation of sexual dysfunction in PCOS. (A) Excessive AMH production
  by PCOS ovaries accesses the motherâ€™s brain, leading to neuroendocrine dysfunction
  promoting high LH secretion. Exacerbated LH signaling favors enhanced ovarian testosterone
  (T) production, and high T levels act on the female fetal brain. AMH also deregulates
  placental steroidogenesis, which increases T bioavailability. (B) Prenatal AMH and
  testosterone excess reprogramming may mediate the loss of progesterone (P4)-sensitive
  nNOS neurons in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in reproductive and sexual
  competence. These brain circuit abnormalities may already be present during prepubertal
  life in girls with PCOS () and are carried over reproductive maturation. (C) Following
  the developmental reprogramming in hypothalamic circuitry, such as nNOS pathways,
  women with PCOS would be more likely to manifest both neuroendocrine and sexual
  dysfunction during adult reproductive life.
