caption: 'Effects of miR-125 (100 nM)- and/or Afa (300 nM)-loaded formulations on
  glycolysis pathway-related factors in AGS cells after 24 h treatment. (A) Scheme
  of glycolysis pathway. (B) Measurement of relative levels of acetyl-CoA, lactate,
  and ATP by using a multifunctional microplate reader. (C) (Left) Measurement of
  glucose uptake by detecting fluorescent analog of glucose (2-NBDG, 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose;
  20 mM) with the use of a flow cytometer (statistical significance at *** p < 0.001).
  (Right) Histogram plots of fluorescent 2-NBDG after various treatments in AGS cells.
  (D) (Left) Effect of various formulations on the expression of proteins in glycolysis-related
  pathway. (Right) Quantification of relative protein levels in glycolysis-related
  pathway. (B,D) * p < 0.05: compared with CTR, † p < 0.05 compared with miR-125/SLN-KL,
  ‡ p < 0.05 compared with Afa, ¶ p < 0.05 compared with Afa/SLN, and § p < 0.05 compared
  with Afa/SLN-KL via Student’s t-test analysis. (E) Measurement of (left) oxygen
  consumption rate (OCR) and (right) extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) by using
  an XFe24 analyzer.'
