caption: (a) GO enrichment analysis. The top 15 BP terms, CC terms, and MF terms are
  shown as a bubble chart according to the -log p value. The colors represent the
  different adjusted p value < 0.05, and the abscissa represents the number of target
  genes. The smaller p value represents higher significance. (b) The top 50 entries
  of KEGG pathway analysis are ordered according to the -lg p value. The redder color
  represents more obvious enrichment. (c) The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway modified
  from hsa04151. Red represents the targets of QKF.
