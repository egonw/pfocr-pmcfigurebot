caption: 'Effects of Si-Miao-Yong-an (SMYA) on mRNA expression of the wnt1/β-catenin
  signalling pathway in aortic of AS mice. After SMYA intervention, the aortic Wnt1,
  β-catenin, and Cyclin D1 mRNA expression levels were significantly decreased in
  mice. while the expression of Gsk-3β mRNA had no significant change among the groups.
  Data are shown as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01, compared with the normal control (NC) group.
  ##p < 0.01, compared with the model group. △p < 0.05, compared with the SVTT group.'
