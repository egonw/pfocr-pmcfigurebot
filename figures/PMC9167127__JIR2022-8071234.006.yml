caption: IL-22 activated the JAK-STAT3/MAPK/AKT signaling pathway in lung cancer cells.
  Cells were treated with IL-22 (0, 5, 10, 50, and 100 ng/mL) and harvested after
  48 hours for western blot. The blots were representative of three experiments, and
  the results were quantified using Quantity One for comparisons among the control
  group and the different concentration groups. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P <
  0.001, when compared to the control group.
