figure_title: DMDRMR induces angiogenesis through sequestering miR-378a-5p
caption: A, B GSEA showing the enrichment of “angiogenesis” (Hallmark database, A)
  and “vegf signaling pathway” (KEGG database, B) in high (red) and low (blue) miR-378a-5p
  expression. C, D Representative bright-field images (left) and quantifications (right)
  of matrigel tube formation of HUVECs incubated with conditioned medium from DMDRMR
  KD 786-O cells transfected with miR-378a-5p inhibitor (C) and DMDRMR OE 769-P cells
  transfected with miR-378a-5p mimic (D) (scale bars, 200 µm). E, F ELISA assay detecting
  the secreted VEGFA levels in DMDRMR KD 786-O cells transfected with miR-378a-5p
  inhibitor (E) and in DMDRMR OE 769-P cells transfected with miR-378a-5p mimic (F).
  The results are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. ns,
  no significant.
