figure_title: TGFB1 is modulated by HIC1
caption: 'a Hierarchical clustering heatmap shows a distinguishable mRNA expression
  profiling among groups. 39 DEGs were showed in here. Red box marks the most up-regulated
  gene TGFB1. b Top 5 enriched KEGG pathways among groups. Red box marks the most
  enriched pathway: the TGF-beta signaling pathway. c Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) enriched a set of differentially expressed genes named JAZAG_TGFB1_SIGNALING_VIA_SMAD4.
  d Real-time PCR analysis show TGFB1 expression level in HIC1-deleted PC3 and C4-2B
  cells compared with the control. (***P < 0.001; two-tailed Student’s t-Test). e
  TGF-β secreted levels in culture supernatants of HIC1-deleted PC3 and C4-2B cells
  compared with the control. Supernatants were collected at 48 h and assayed via ELISA
  for TGF-β (*P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001. two-tailed Student’s t-Test). f ELISA analysis
  of TGF-β secretion levels in serum of Ctrl mice (n = 7) compared with dCKO (n = 10)
  mice. (*P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). g Pearson''s correlation analysis showed
  that theTGFB1 expression level correlates negatively with the HIC1 expression levels
  in cell lines which were commonly used in prostate cancer research (R2 = 0.421).
  h Upper panel: WB analysis demonstrated the expression of HIC1 in human PCa cell
  lines and human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Lower panel: Relative expression
  level of HIC1 and TGFB1 in these cell lines. i Kaplan–Meier analysis of the probability
  of progression-free survival (PFS) in131 patients with PCa stratified by HIC1 and
  TGF-β expression, respectively. j Representative IHC images of TMA showing the corresponding
  expression of epithelial HIC1 and TGF-β in PCa tumor tissues. The black and red
  dashed lines indicate the epithelial area. Scale bar: 200 (upper panel) and 50 μm
  (lower panel). k, l Analysis of IRS score of HIC1 and TGF-β staining between normal
  and tumor, stage I–II and stage III–IV tissues. (P values were obtained using two-tailed
  Student’s t tests. The Whiskers connect the minimum and the maximum values to the
  Box; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).'
