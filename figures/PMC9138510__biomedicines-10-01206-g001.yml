caption: TGF-β activation and the canonical, SMAD-dependent signaling pathway. TGF-β
  is produced in a latent form as part of a latent complex tethered to ECM. The latent
  complex consists of mature dimeric TGF-β, associated with latency-associated peptide
  (black color) and a latent TGF-β-binding protein (magenta color). Latent TGF-β can
  be activated and released from the complex by integrins, proteases, TSP-1, and ROS.
  Active TGF-β binds to its receptors and initiates Smad signaling to exert its biological
  effects. The activities of TGF-β signaling can be modulated through (1) TGF-β translation
  and production, (2) TGF-β activation, (3) TGF-β neutralization using recombinant
  antibodies, (4) synthetic molecules that inhibit the phosphorylation of the TGFBR
  and SMAD, and (5) targeting downstream effectors. The red boxes show inhibitors
  and their action sites mentioned in this review.
