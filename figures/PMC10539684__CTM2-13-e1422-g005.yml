caption: Ying Yang 1 (YY1) regulated prostate cancer cell plasticity through a non‐canonical
  Wnt pathway. (A, B) Western blotting (A) and quantitative reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) (B) analyses were used to observe the role of
  depleted FZD8 and β‐catenin on charcoal‐stripped fetal bovine serum (CS‐FBS)‐induced
  cell plasticity in LNCaP cells. (C) Luciferase assay showing the role of FZD8 knockdown
  on the β‐catenin/TCF‐dependent transcriptional activity. (D) RT qPCR analyses show
  the level of Wnt ligand mRNA after CS‐FBS treatment. (E) Beltran datasets show the
  fold‐change of indicated Wnt ligands in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) versus
  castration‐resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). (F) LTL331‐331R patient‐derived xenograft
  (PDX) model demonstrates changes in mRNA levels of the indicated Wnt ligands with
  castration time series. (G) Immunofluorescence assays showing the sub‐localization
  of FZD8 and Wnt9A in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and the binding effect after androgen
  deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment. (H) Luciferase assay showing the role of YY1
  overexpression on the transcriptional activity of STAT3. (I) RT qPCR analyses were
  performed to observe the effect of depleted FZD8 after YY1 overexpression on STAT3
  downstream genes. (J) Western blot was used to detect the activity of FYN and STAT3
  signalling pathways in Du145‐NC/Du145‐sg‐YY1 and LNCaP‐Vector/LNCaP‐OE‐YY1 cells.
  (K) Western blotting showing the activity of FYN and STAT3 signalling pathways in
  LNCaP‐OE‐YY1 cells after FZD8 knockdown. n.s, not significant, *p < .05, **p < .01,
  ***p < .001.
