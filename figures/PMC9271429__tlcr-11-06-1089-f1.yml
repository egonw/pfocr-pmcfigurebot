caption: 'STT3A is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and correlated with the
  poor prognosis of LUAD patients. (A) Heat map of DE glycosyltransferase in LUAD
  and normal adjacent tissues; (B) STT3A expression in TCGA database (normal: 59;
  tumor: 535); (C) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of STT3A in the
  tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of 10 clinical patients with LUAD; (D)
  the relative expression of STT3A in clinical specimens was detected by qRT-PCR (n=10);
  (E) IHC staining was performed in paired clinical specimens, and the results showed
  that STT3A was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues (scale bar: 20 µm); (F) the
  expression levels of STT3A in NSCLC cancerous cell lines, including H3122, H1975,
  H1299, HCC827, H292, H1650, A549, and PC-9 were examined by Western blot, and compared
  to normal human bronchial epithelial cell lines (BEAS-2B and MRC-5); (G) Kaplan-Meier
  analysis of OS according to TCGA database; the high expression of STT3A is correlated
  with a worse survival rate (P=0.009); (H) Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS according
  to the GEO cohort (P=0.00033); (I) representative images of different immunohistochemical
  staining intensities of STT3A in TMA. Scale bar: 20 µm. (J) High STT3A expression
  was associated with poor OS in LUAD patients in the TMA samples. **, P<0.01; ***,
  P<0.001; ns, not significant. STT3A, STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalytic

  real-time polymerase chain reaction; IHC, immunochemistry; NSCLC, non-small cell
