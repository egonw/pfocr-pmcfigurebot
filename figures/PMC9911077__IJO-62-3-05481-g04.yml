caption: 'α-hederin overcomes hypoxia-mediated resistance in colorectal cancer cells
  via the AKT/Bcl2 pathway in vivo. (A) Xenograft tumour growth curves. (B) Representative
  images of the immunohistochemical staining of Ki67, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, p-AKT and HIF-1α
  in tissues and the evaluation of apoptosis in each group by TUNEL. Scale bars, 50
  µm. (C) Images and weights of tumours. (D) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
  was used to measure the expression levels of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL in tissues. (E) Mouse
  weight curves after treatment in the CRC xenograft model. (F) Detection of changes
  in blood biochemical indicators in mice. (G) Haematoxylin and eosin staining to
  observe organ damage (magnification, x100). Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. hypoxia; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. normoxia. ALT, alanine aminotransferase;
  AST, aspartate aminotransferase; N.S., not significant; RBC, red blood cell; PLT,
  platelets; WBC, white blood cell.'
