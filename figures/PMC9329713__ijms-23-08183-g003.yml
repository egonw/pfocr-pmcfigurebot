caption: 'Endocytosis and intracellular pathway of retinoic acid (RA) conjugated to
  ND. (a) After endosome formation in the cell, the crucial step is the release of
  RA from the endosome and its binding to the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein
  (CRABP). CRABP transports RA into the nucleus, where it can form large protein complexes
  consisting of co-activators and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X
  receptor (RXR), activating RA response elements (RARE). (b,c) Internalisation assay
  performed with two human cell lines: non-invasive papillary urothelial cancer cells
  RT4 (b) and invasive urothelial cancer cells T24 (c). For both cell lines, DNDs
  were added to the culture medium at a concentration of 11 µg/mL for 24 h and cells
  were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. DNDs were observed in endocytotic
  compartments (black arrows; (b,c)) and in multilamellar bodies (white arrow; c).
  A detailed analysis of the endocytosis of DNDs is published in []. Scale bars: 500
  nm. The illustration was created by the authors using the BioRender app and our
  own TEM images.'
