caption: 'Effects of PB on the PFC cytokine response to LPS. At the early timepoint,
  PB treatment suppresses the IL-1β response to LPS in the PFC compared to vehicle-treated
  controls. At the delayed timepoint, a history of PB treatment elicits an increased
  IL-12 and GM-CSF response to LPS in the PFC compared to vehicle-treated controls.
  All data are expressed as mean percent change from saline-treated controls from
  each respective group  SEM, n = 7–9. See  for complete list of PFC cytokines measured.
  [*: Significant effect of PB treatment compared to vehicle treatment].'
