caption: 'Identifying the core metabolites: (A) The KEGG enrichment pathway bubble
  map between X and J samples. (B) The flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathways.
  (C) Heatmap analysis of critical metabolites in the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis
  pathways. (D) Associations between taste characteristics and metabolite data. Note:
  (A) Each bubble in the figure represents a metabolic pathway (the top 20 with the
  highest significance were selected according to p-value). The horizontal coordinate
  where the bubble is located and the bubble size represent the influence factor size
  of the path in the topology analysis, and the larger the size, the larger the influence
  factor. The vertical coordinate where the bubble is located and the bubble color
  represent the p-value of enrichment analysis (take the negative common logarithm,
  i.e., âˆ’log10 p-value); the darker the color, the smaller the p-value, and the more
  significant the enrichment degree; the enrichment factor represents the proportion
  of the number of differential metabolites in this pathway in the total number of
  annotated metabolites in this pathway. (B) The small circular nodes in the metabolic
  pathway diagram represent metabolites; the metabolites labeled in red are the significantly
  upregulated differential metabolites detected in the experiment (VIP > 1, p < 0.05,
  fold change > 1), while the metabolites labeled in blue are the significantly downregulated
  differential metabolites detected experimentally (VIP > 1, p < 0.05, fold change
  > 1). The depth of the color indicates the degree of downward adjustment.'
