caption: 'Symptoms, genome, and phylogenesis of the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum
  virus B (CVB-CN). a Symptoms of CVB-CN on Chrysanthemum morifolium leaves. b Genome
  structure of CVB-CN. The putative open reading frames (ORFs) are indicated with
  different rectangles and 20 contigs assembled from virus-derived small RNAs are
  shown with black lines. c Evolutionary analysis of CVB-CN and the other 10 CVBs
  based on whole genome sequences. The trees were constructed with MEGA 11 using the
  neighbor-joining method with maximum composite likelihood model, and bootstrap values
  were estimated using 1000 replicates. The NCBI accession numbers of the other 10
  CVB isolates with the whole genome sequences reported were: CVB-GS1 (MZ514908),
  CVB-S (AB245142), CVB-HZ2 (MW269553), CVB-HZ1 (MW269552), CVB-FY (MZ514910), CVB-GS2
  (MZ514909), CVB-PB (AM493895), CVB-TN (AM765839), CVB-UK (AM765838), and CVB-UP
  (AM765837)'
article_title: Integrated next-generation sequencing and comparative transcriptomic
  analysis of leaves provides novel insights into the ethylene pathway of Chrysanthemum
  morifolium in response to a Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B.
