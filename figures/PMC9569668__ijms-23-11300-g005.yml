caption: Silencing of AEG-1 and miR-221 inhibits HCC cell migration and proliferation
  in vitro. The effect of the miR-221/AEG-1 measured on HCC cell migration and cell
  proliferation in the miR-221 mimic-, miR-221 inhibitor-, AEG-1 siRNA-, and their
  control-transfected HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cells by invasion (A), migration (B),
  and MTT assay (C) in vitro. Images analyzed using Image J (NIH) (scale bar, 100
  µm). Error bars presented as mean ± s.d and p-value represented as ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 compared to the corresponding controls.
