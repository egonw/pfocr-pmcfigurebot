caption: Schematic representation of the pathway described in this paper. (A) The
  αVβ3 integrin, together with its co-activator K2, induces increased levels of NgR2
  expression in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells. In turn, NgR2 regulates
  the levels of NE markers and stimulates anchorage-independent growth of these cells.
  NgR2 also upregulates the levels of RhoA that causes increased PrCa cell motility.
  These cells with increased NgR2 expression are likely to be NEPrCa cells. (B) The
  schematic drawing summarizes our proposed model.

  differentiation in prostate cancer.
