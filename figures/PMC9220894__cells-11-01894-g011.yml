caption: Graphic abstract summarizing the proposed mechanism whereby increased RIP3
  in response to renal I/R reduces Mitofilin levels to amplify inflammation and exacerbates
  kidney injury. An increase in cytosolic RIP3 levels in response to kidney I/R promotes
  the translocation of RIP3 into the mitochondria, where it interacts with and favors
  Mitofilin degradation, leading to increased mitochondrial structural damage and
  dysfunction. The following increase in ROS production in the mitochondria is proposed
  to enable mtDNA damage and release into the cytosol, where the mtDNA activates the
  cGAS–STING–p-p65 pathway, leading to increased nuclear transcription of pro-inflammatory
  markers that subsequently exacerbate renal I/R injury.
