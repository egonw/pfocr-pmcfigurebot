caption: SCFAs result in increased activity on G-protein-coupled receptors and enhanced
  epigenetic regulatory activity through HDAC. SCFAs could be able to act positively
  on pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., by negatively modulating the NF-ÎºB signalling
  pathway) and pro-oxidant pathways (e.g., by positively modulating the Nrf2 pathway).
