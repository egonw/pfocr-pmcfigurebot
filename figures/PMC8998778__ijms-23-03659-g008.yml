caption: 'Basal and phosphorylated expression of STAT3, STAT6, ERK1/2 and Akt, and
  activation of PI3K in C-WT, C-N and C-KD clones. WB was performed to determine the
  expression of relevant pathway components in C-WT, C-N-2 and C-4-1. The phosphorylation
  of kinases and transcription factors was detected in cells treated with recombinant
  IL-4 (0.4 nM for 30 min) and IL-13 (1 nM for 30 min) in comparison to untreated
  cells (-). Î²-actin was used as loading control. Abbreviations: Akt: protein kinase
  B; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRS: insulin receptor substrate;
  PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
