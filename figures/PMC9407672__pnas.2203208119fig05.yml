caption: The FA pathway is indispensable for PGC proliferation and fertility. (A)
  Alkaline phosphatase staining of whole-mount or genital ridges from wild-type and
  Fanci−/− mice and PGC counts at various embryonic stages as indicated. The reddish-brown
  spots indicate PGCs. n = 15/10/13/16/12/14 embryos. (B) Immunofluorescence staining
  of cyclin B1 and EdU incorporation in E11.5 wild-type and Fanci−/− genital ridges
  to evaluate the cell cycle progression of PGCs (G1, cyclin B1 negative; S, EdU positive;
  G2, cyclin B1 strongly positive in cytoplasm; M, cyclin B1 accumulation in the nucleus).
  n = 5/5 embryos. (C) Cleaved PARP1 immunostaining (an apoptotic marker) in E11.5
  wild-type and Fanci−/− genital ridges to evaluate the apoptotic PGCs (STELLA and
  cleaved PARP1 double positive). n = 5/5 embryos. (D) Representative images of p-p53
  immunostaining and quantification of the percentage of p-p53–positive PGCs in E11.5
  genital ridges from wild-type and Fanci−/− embryos. n = 6/6 embryos. (E) Deletion
  of p53 to rescue the reduction in the number of PGCs in E11.5 Fanci−/− embryos.
  STELLA immunostaining to quantify the PGC number in the genital ridges with the
  indicated genotypes. n = 6/5/6/6 embryos. (F) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of
  wild-type and Fanci−/− paraffin sections of ovaries from 12-wk-old females and testes
  and epididymis from 10-wk-old males. Alkaline phosphatase staining or STELLA positivity
  indicates PGC. Data points from individual embryos are presented as dots. Data are
  presented as the means ± SD (A–E). (Scale bars, 200 μm in A; 50 μm in B, C, E, and
  F; and 10 μm in D.) Arrowheads indicate representative cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001; unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (A–E).
