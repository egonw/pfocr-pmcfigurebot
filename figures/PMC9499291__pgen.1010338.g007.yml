figure_title: The pathway of ADF7-inhbited-VLN1 is crucial for root hair formation
  in plant osmotic stress tolerance
caption: (A) Relative expression level of ADF7 and VLN1 in roots from 6-d-old Col-0
  seedlings with 200, 250, and 300 mM mannitol treatments. Values are means ± SD of
  three independent biological replicates. *** P< 0.001, Student’s t-test compared
  with Col-0. (B) GUS activity of 4-d-old seedlings carrying the pADF7::GUS or pVLN1::GUS
  reporter gene with 0, 250, and 300 mM mannitol treatments. Scale bar, 50 μm. (C)
  Western blotting using proteins extracted from different genotypes carrying the
  pADF7::ADF7-GFP gene or pVLN1::VLN1-GFP gene with 0, 250, and 300 mM mannitol treatments.
  Rubisco was used as a loading control. Histograms depict quantification of the relative
  grayscale value. Values are means ± SD of three independent biological replicates.
  ** P< 0.01, *** P < 0.001, Student’s t-test compared to Col-0 with 0 mM mannitol
  treatment. (D) Histogram depicting root hair number from ADF7 and VLN1 genotypes
  under 0, 200, 250, and 300 mM mannitol treatments. (E) Images of growth state from
  ADF7 and VLN1 genotype seedlings under 0, 250, and 300 mM mannitol treatments. Scale
  bar, 1 cm. (F) to (H) Phenotypic characteristics of leaf area (F), dry weight (G),
  water content (H) from 16-d-old genotype seedlings under 0, 250, and 300 mM mannitol
  treatments. Significant differences (P< 0.05; indicated by different letters) among
  genotypes are determined for each condition by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
  test in (D), (F), (G), and (H).
