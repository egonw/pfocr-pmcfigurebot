caption: 'Atovaquone targets purine synthesis pathway for the Vero E6 cells at 1 and
  5 µM. (A) Metabolomic analyses for DMSO and Atovaquone treated Vero E6 cells at
  1, 5, and 10 µM, showing downregulation of adenosine, guanosine, and inosine levels.
  (B) Molecular pathway of de novo purine synthesis. (C) Levels of free guanosine,
  inosine, and adenosine with respect to GMP, IMP, and AMP at Vero-E6 cells treated
  with 1 and 5 µM ATO. (D) Left Panel: Representative WB of NT5E in vehicle and Atovaquone
  treated cells. Right Panel: Quantification of NT5E protein expression demonstrating
  a significant decrease in cells treated with 5 µM Atovaquone. (E) WB of CD73 (NT5E)
  in vehicle and Atovaquone treated cells for independent replicates.'
