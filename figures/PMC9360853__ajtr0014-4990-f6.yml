caption: Kaplan-Meier curves of patients with mutated and wild genes. Survival analyses
  were performed using the survival package of R software. Each gene was evaluated
  individually using the Kaplan-Meier method in R. A. Kaplan-Meier curve of patients
  with mutated (n=4) and wild (n=22) KRAS gene. B. Kaplan-Meier curve of patients
  with mutated (n=6) and wild (n=20) VEGF signaling pathway. C. Kaplan-Meier curve
  of patients with high (n=8) and low (n=5) TMB group.
