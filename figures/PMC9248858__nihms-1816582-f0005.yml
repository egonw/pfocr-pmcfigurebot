caption: (A) Human choroidal single-cell RNA sequencing data. Cells expressing at
  least one read of IL1B, NLRP3, and CASP1 (i.e., triple-positive cells) are colored
  in red, while the remaining cells are colored in gray. A total of 58.6% of macrophages
  expressed IL1B, NLRP3, and CASP1.(B) Violin plots of IL1B, NLRP3, and CASP1 expression
  by cell type indicate macrophage-specific expression of these transcripts.(C) Using
  the same single-cell RNA sequencing data, differential expression analysis was performed
  between macrophages originating from AMD donors(n = 2) versus control donors (n
  = 4). Differential expression results are displayed in a volcano plot, where positive
  log fold changes indicate enrichment in AMD samples. Results for IL1B, CASP1, and
  NLRP3 are highlighted.(D) Visualization of healthy human neurosensory retina single-cell
  clusters using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) sequencing data
  from normal retinas. Cells expressing at least one read of IL1B, NLRP3, and CASP1
  (i.e., triple-positive cells) are colored in red, while the remaining cells are
  colored in gray. Enrichment in these three transcripts is specific to microglia.(E)
  Visualization of healthy human neurosensory retina single-cell clusters using t-SNE
  sequencing data from normal retinas. Cells expressing at least one read of HAMP
  (protein name hepcidin) are colored in red, while the remaining cells are colored
  in gray. Enrichment in HAMP is specific to microglia.(F) Bulk neurosensory retina
  RNA sequencing on normal (NL), early AMD, and late AMD macular retina or peripheral
  retina showing expression of IL1B, NLRP3, and CASP1 across disease progression in
  a region-specific manner. Color scale corresponds to log2 of expression measured
  in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM).(G) IL-1β
  ELISA performed on neurosensory retina from eyes without AMD (MGS1, n = 6) and with
  early (MGS2, n = 6) or intermediate (MGS3, n = 6) AMD. See  for donor information.**p
  < 0.01 by unpaired Student’s t test (J).
