caption: Regulatory networks in ethanol treated myotubes identify HMB targets. (A).
  Integrated network of the proteome from ethanol-treated myotubes of HMB targets-
  mTORC1 signaling with nodes including mitochondrial dysfunction, p70S6k signaling,
  AMPK signaling, and senescence pathways connected via shared molecules. (B). Integrated
  network of IGF-1 signaling pathway in ethanol treated myotubes. N= 3 biological
  replicates for untreated and ethanol-treated myotubes. Significance for proteomics
  and transcriptomics expression levels for cells was limited to p<0.05. Significance
  for pathway enrichment analysis was limited to -log(p-value)= > 1.3.
