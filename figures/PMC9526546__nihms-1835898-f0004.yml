figure_title: Imp-L2 produced from gamergate ovaries preferentially antagonizes the
  IIS-AKT pathway
caption: (A) RNA abundance of ovarian lmp-L2 and ALS in workers (W), gamergates (G),
  and revertants (R). Bars and error bars represent mean Â± SEM. LogCPM, log counts
  per million. (B) IF staining of insulin/IGF-binding proteins (ALS and Imp-L2) in
  the late stages of the egg chambers of a gamergate ovary as indicated with a pink
  box in the schematic at top. Magenta indicates ALS and Imp-L2 at top and bottom,
  respectively. DAPI is shown in cyan. (C and D) Western blot analyses showing the
  effects of recombinant Imp-L2 or ALS (produced in Sf9 cells) on IIS-AKT and IIS-MAPK
  pathways in the abdominal fat body tissue dissected from workers. Levels of P-AKT,
  T-AKT, P-MAPK, T-MAPK, and tubulin detected in the fat body as a function of treatment
  with Ins peptide minus/plus recombinant (C) Imp-L2 or (D) ALS protein. (E) A quantitative
  plot of phosphorylation levels of AKT and MAPK from the worker fat body incubated
  with or without Imp-L2 in the presence and absence of Ins peptide. Bars and error
  bars indicate median with interquartile range. P values are from Mann-Whitney test
  (*P < 0.05, n = 8 individuals). (F) Proposed models of reproduction-associated longevity
  in ants. (Left) A short-lived worker. (Right) A long-lived gamergate. The basal
  level of insulin (Ins) secreted from the worker brain is sufficient to activate
  the IIS-AKT pathway through insulin receptors (InRs) in the abdominal fat body,
  resulting in FOXO phosphorylation and a normal life span in workers. By contrast,
  the high level of Ins in the gamergate brain promotes ovary maturation and contributes
  to MAPK activation in the fat body. An unidentified receptor (left of InR1/2) may
  also contribute to MAPK activation. Additionally, RNA abundance of InR1/2 is decreased
  in the fat body of gamergate compared with that of worker (shown as lighter color),
  and the gamergate ovary produces Imp-L2 protein that antagonizes IIS-AKT signaling
  in the fat body. Together, this might lead to nuclear localization of FOXO and longevity
  in gamergates.
