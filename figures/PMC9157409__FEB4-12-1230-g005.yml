caption: The morphology and cell viability of human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)
  after exposure to 0, 20, or 50 mmHg pressure for 24 h with or without the addition
  of Y‐27632 in medium. (A) Representative phase‐contrast images show the morphology
  of HSCs under a light microscope. Scale bar = 200 μm. (B) Representative images
  of phalloidin staining shows the formation of F‐actin in HSCs. Scale bars = 30 μm.
  Quantitative data indicate the total cell count (C) and cell viability (D) from
  three independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
