caption: PDCs of BMs from diverse primary tumor origins were used to assess the efficacy
  of PI3K and mTOR inhibitors(A–L). PDCs were established from surgical BM samples
  derived from patients with (A)–(C) melanoma, (D)–(F) lung carcinoma, (G)–(I) endometrium
  cancer, and (J)–(L) colon cancer. (A, D, G, J) Representative western blots demonstrate
  different patterns of Pi3K and mTOR pathway inhibition after incubation of PDCs
  with buparlisib and everolimus, respectively. Inhibition of cell proliferation upon
  treatment with increasing doses of buparlisib (B, E, H, K) and everolimus (C, F,
  I, L) also show different levels of inhibition among BM-derived PDCs. Cell viability
  was measured using MTS assay. Data are represented as median with interquartile
  range, with three technical replicates. Differences were considered statistically
  significant for p values <0.05, according to the Mann-Whitney test.
