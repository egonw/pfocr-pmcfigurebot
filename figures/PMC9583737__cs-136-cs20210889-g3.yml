figure_title: TGFβ increased the expression of FZD8, which is required for TGFβ-mediated
  up-regulation of Collagen-I
caption: (A) Genes regulated by TGFβ in the Wnt signalling pathway were identified
  using a targeted qPCR profiling array (n=3) and the data are presented as a heatmap
  and P-values are presented in the figure. The relative fold-change in gene expression
  in TGFβ-treated cells is given for each of the three replicates. Differences between
  treatments were determined by t-test and corrected for multiple testing. (B–K) qPCR
  quantification of selected collagen and TGFβ-regulated genes in the Wnt-signalling
  pathway from RNA isolated from the mucosa overlying SCD and patient-matched NSCD
  intestine (n=6). The mRNA levels are normalised to the house-keeping gene RPLPO.
  Differences between treatments were determined by a paired t-test to account for
  different cell passages. In general, data are presented as fold-changes with panels
  C–J as box plots showing 25th to 75th percentiles, median (horizontal bar), and
  the smallest and largest value (whiskers). Significant results relative to control
  are indicated by * symbol (*<0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001). A bar indicates specific
  statistical comparisons.
