caption: Photomicrograph of the liver tissues in the different experimental group.
  (A) NC group showing normal histological architecture of the liver with normal hepatic
  cords and hepatocytes. (B,C) CCl4 group showing hepatocellular necrosis in periportal
  and pericentral areas with macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis, mononuclear
  inflammatory cell aggregation, and marked collagen fibers proliferation with disorganization
  of hepatic cords. (D,E) CCl4+ D-carvone group showing moderate hepatocellular necrosis
  around the central vein with mild mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltration. (F)
  D-carvone group showing normal hepatic cellular findings.
