caption: The EDA pathway involved in the pathogenesis of HED, cancer, and NAFLD. Gene
  mutations in the EDA pathway lead to hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), with
  clinical symptoms including xerophthalmia, sweat gland dysplasia, hypodontia, and
  follicular dysplasia. EDA signaling is also involved in tumorigenesis and cancer
  progression of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oral cancer, and melanoma. In addition,
  EDA, as a newly discovered hepatocyte factor, may be highly involved in the pathogenesis
  of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
