caption: SRGN‐induced IL‐1β upregulates pro‐angiogenic HGF and AREG in HEFs by activating
  PLCγ1/ERK/AP‐1 pathway. (A) Experimental design (left panel) and representative
  images of the tube formation assay (right panel; scale bar, 100 μm). (B) Analysis
  of the tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
  using parameters of number of nodes, junctions, branches, and total branching length
  (n = 4). (C) Effects of SRGN CM, ΔGAG CM, mGAG CM, and shSRGN CM on PLCγ1/ERK/AP‐1
  signalling pathway in HEFs. (D) Effects of IL‐1β‐knockdown on SRGN CM‐mediated activation
  of PLCγ1/ERK/AP‐1 signalling pathway in HEFs. Effects of (E) c‐Fos‐knockdown (n = 3)
  and (F) T‐5224 treatment (n = 3) on mRNA expression levels of HGF and AREG in HEFs
  treated with SRGN CM from ESCC cells
