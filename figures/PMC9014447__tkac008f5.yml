caption: Suppression of Notch signaling led to elevated intracellular ROS and cell
  apoptosis in primary PMVECs challenged with burn serum. (a) Fluorescence intensity
  and analysis of ROS in primary PMVECs treated with DMSO, DMSO + burn serum, and
  GSI + burn serum, untreated PMVECs as the control, **p < 0.01. (b) Apoptosis and
  analysis in primary PMVECs treated with DMSO, DMSO + burn serum, and GSI + burn
  serum, untreated PMVECs as the control. Q2 + Q3 represents apoptosis, **p < 0.01.
  PMVECs pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, GSI γ-secretase inhibitor, ROS
  reactive oxygen species, DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide, MFI mean fluorescence intensity
