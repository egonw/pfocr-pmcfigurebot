caption: 'Piperlongumine (PL) and vitamin C (VC) induced reactive oxygen species-dependent
  apoptosis in two gastric cancer cell lines in vitro: (a) AGS and KATO III cells
  were treated with 15 µM PL or 3 mM VC with/without 5 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)
  preincubation for 48 h and then stained with annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) for
  the flow cytometric analysis of the levels of apoptosis; (b) the proportion of cells
  that were apoptotic after treatment with PL, VC and NAC. Data presented as mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; analysis of variance. The colour version of
  this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.'
