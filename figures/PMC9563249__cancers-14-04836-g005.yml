caption: Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that H3.3K27M regulated the β-catenin/USP1/EZH2
  signaling pathway. (A) Representative blots and statistical graph of the H3.3K27M-induced
  increase in EZH2 activity in U87 and LN229 cells. (B) Representative blots and histograms
  showing the quantitative analysis of the increase in USP1 protein levels induced
  by H3.3K27M in U87 and LN229 cells. (C) Quantification of USP1 mRNA levels in U87
  and LN229 cells after stable H3.3K27M overexpression. (D) Representative blots and
  statistical graph of β-catenin and P-β-catenin (Ser675) levels in U87 and LN229
  cells. * p < 0.05; ns indicates no statistical significance.
