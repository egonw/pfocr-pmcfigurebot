caption: PTP candidates stimulate phosphorylation of YAP-pS127 endogenously. Western
  blot analysis of YAP-pS127 after induction of PTP candidate expression by Dox in
  HEK293T stable cell line. Without Dox, HEK293T-PTP stable cell lines do not express
  PTPs, while Dox treatment induces expression of FLAG-tagged PTPs. Band intensity
  of YAP and phosphorylated YAP-pS127 was quantified via ImageJ 1.54g. Expression
  of each of PTP candidates stimulates phosphorylation of YAP at S127, which is indicated
  by intensity ratio of Â±Dox.
