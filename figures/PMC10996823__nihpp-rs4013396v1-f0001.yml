figure_title: Stress response, Protein and RNA metabolism, cellular transport, and
  pro-death pathways are significantly enriched in DT-061-treated cells
caption: A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identifies ER stress-related and cellular
  adaptation pathways such as t-RNA charging, EIF2, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress
  response, and UPR, as well as cell death including autophagy, senescence, death
  receptor, and necroptosis signaling, cascades among the topmost significantly induced
  pathways in HGSC cancer cells after 3 hours of DT-061 relative to DMSO. The color
  scale represents Z-score activation and circles represent the statistical significance.
  B) Top enriched pathways categorized by overall functional relevance and pathway
  clustering. Data separated by upregulated in OV and simultaneously downregulated
  in FT (left) or vice-versa (right). C) Schematic representing the expression and
  secretion cycle of Gaussia luciferase, depicting each important step for its efficient
  detection. This system was utilized as a reporter assay to monitor the secretory
  pathway and measure ER stress as previously described by Badr et al. D) Fold change
  luminescence intensity relative to 0h DMSO. Media was collected at 3, 6, 12, and
  24 hours after treatment with DMSO, DT-061, or BFA as an indirect measurement of
  secretion ability. Data presented as the mean ± SD (n=3), (one-way ANOVA with multiple
  comparisons, comparing the mean of each column with the mean of DMSO control column,
  ns > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). E) Fold change
  luminescence intensity relative to 0h DMSO. Cell lysates were collected at 3, 6,
  12, and 24 hours after treatment with DMSO, DT-061, or BFA as an indirect measurement
  of protein expression. Data presented as the mean ± SD (n=3), (one-way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons, comparing the mean of each column with the mean of DMSO control
  column, ns > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). F) Protein
  analysis of Gaussia luciferase expression was performed via western blotting (left),
  with its respective quantification represented (right). G) Puromycin 10-minute pulse
  with 50-minute chase labeling experiments in the presence of DMSO or DT-061 after
  3, 6, 9, and 24 hours incubation, to measure newly translated protein. Western blotting
  analysis was used to quantify puromycin incorporation and GAPDH as the loading control
  (top). Whole lane quantification was graphed as fold change in puromycin expression
  relative to respective DMSO over time (bottom). Data presented as the mean ± SD
  (n=3), (one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, comparing the mean of each column
  with the mean of 3h DMSO control column (not represented) for respective cell line,
  ns > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
