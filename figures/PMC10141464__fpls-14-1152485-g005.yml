caption: 'Volcano plots of DEGs in the pairwise comparisons and pathway enrichment.
  (A) Volcano plot of DEGs in the TT vs. TC comparison. Green dots represent genes
  upregulated in Turpentine Treated. Red dots represent genes upregulated in Turpentine
  Control. (B) Volcano plot of DEGs in the MT vs. MC comparison.Green dots represent
  genes upregulated in Mylepelian Treated. Red dots represent genes upregulated in
  Mylepelian Control. (C) Volcano plot of DEGs in the MT vs. TT comparison.Green dots
  represent genes upregulated in Mylepelian Treated. Red dots represent genes upregulated
  in Turpentine Treated. x-axis: fold change in gene expression between different
  samples; y-axis: statistical significance of the differences represented by red
  dots.'
