figure_title: Proximal tubular cells express a failed-repair molecular signature in
  ADPKD kidneys
caption: a Subclustering of healthy control PT lineage on the UMAP plot of snRNA-seq
  dataset, colored by subtypes (left and middle) or VCAM1 expression level (right).
  N-PTC normal proximal tubular cells, FR-PTC failed-repair proximal tubular cells.
  b Subclustering of healthy control FR-PTC and ADPKD PT cells on the UMAP, colored
  by disease (left) or subtypes (PT-1/2/3/4, right). c Dot plot showing gene expression
  patterns of the genes enriched in each of PT subtypes in ADPKD kidneys. The diameter
  of the dot corresponds to the proportion of cells expressing the indicated gene
  and the intensity of the dot corresponds to average expression relative to all ADPKD
  PT cells. d Pearson correlations of the averaged expressions of highly variable
  genes between PT subtypes in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model mouse kidneys
  (GSE139107) and those of human ADPKD dataset. The highly variable genes among IRI
  mouse PT cells that also exist in human dataset were analyzed (1648 genes). The
  heatmap shows Pearson correlation coefficients (R). Source data are provided as
  a Source Data file. e Violin plot showing VCAM1, CUBN, or LRP2 gene mRNA expression
  among PT subtypes of ADPKD kidneys. f Immunohistochemistry analysis on human ADPKD
  kidney for VCAM1 (green) and CUBN (red, left) or LRP2 (red, right). Representative
  images of n = 3 samples. Scale bar indicates 50 µm. g Heatmap showing enrichment
  of hallmark genesets of the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) for oxidative
  phosphorylation or inflammatory pathways. Source data are provided as a Source Data
  file. h Heatmap showing pathway enrichment on PT subpopulations with PROGENy.
