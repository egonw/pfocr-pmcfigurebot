caption: '(A) Pathway showing the synthesis of β-carotene from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate and its conversion to retinal by β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (product
  key: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl
  diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate). The parts of the pathway common
  to both Ralstonia eutropha and Erwinia sp. and unique to Erwinia sp. are indicated.
  The enzyme key is as follows: Dxs, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; Dxr,
  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; IspH, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate reductase; crtE, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; crtB, phytoene
  synthase; crtI, phytoene desaturase; crtY, lycopene cyclase. (B) GR expression in
  R. eutropha H16 causes a distinct pink coloration. Absorbance scan of isolated membranes
  from the induced H16 GR cells shows absorption at 540 nm (arrowed), a light wavelength
  that is not absorbed by chlorophyll. (C) The gene-circuit design shows the arrangement
  of the pLO11a-blhDxrCRT-GR construct. This contains the crt operon (crtEXYIB) plus
  an 879 bp upstream region containing the crtE endogenous promoter (PcrtE) and the
  dxr, blh, and GR genes (with upstream ribosome binding site shown as semi-circles)
  under the control of the arabinose inducible PBAD promoter.'
