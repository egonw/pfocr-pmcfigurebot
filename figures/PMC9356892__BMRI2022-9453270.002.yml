caption: IL-8 expression in tissues of odontogenic lesions and IL-8 secretion is regulated
  by the NF-κB signaling pathway in HaCaT cells. (a, b) Representative immunohistochemical
  staining and score of IL-8 in odontogenic lesions including dentigerous cyst (n
  = 12) and odontogenic keratocyst (n = 28). (c) The calcium level within the cyst
  fluid of odontogenic keratocyst (n = 3) was calculated. (d) Thapsigargin (2 μM)
  significantly upregulated the intracellular calcium level within HaCaT cells in
  90 seconds. (e) Thapsigargin significantly upregulated the protein level of IL-8
  in HaCaT cells and partially reduced by NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082, 2 μM) in 6 h.
