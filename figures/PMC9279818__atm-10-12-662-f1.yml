caption: Quantitative proteomic analysis of myocardial tissue after ischemia-reperfusion
  in mice. (A) Global analysis clustering heat map. (B) GO analysis of cell component
  enrichment (biological process); red is extremely significant enrichment (P<0.01),
  yellow is enrichment (0.05>Pâ‰¥0.01). (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (D) Directed
  acyclic diagram of Reactome enrichment pathway. (E) Schematic diagram of interaction
  network. IR, ischemia-reperfusion group; Con, control group; IR-V, operation + drug
  intervention group; GO, Gene Ontology; ID, identification; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.
