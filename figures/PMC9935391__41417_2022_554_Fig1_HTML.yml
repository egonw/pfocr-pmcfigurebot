figure_title: LINC02820 is upregulated in ESCC
caption: A Heatmap of 27 differentially expressed lncRNAs in three paired ESCC tissues
  and adjacent normal tissues. B The LINC02820 levels in different cancers. C LINC02820
  RNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR in 86 pairs of ESCC and adjacent normal tissues.
  D Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of LINC02820 in ESCC (n = 86).
  E The overall survival analysis of 42 ESCC patients (n = 42, p = 0.059). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
