caption: MiR-136 directly regulates MEX3C expression. (a) The expression of MEX3C
  in cervical cancer and normal tissues. (b) We used quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction to examine MEX3C expression in cervical cancer cells and normal cells.
  (c) A comparison of MEX3C expression in cervical cancer and adjacent normal tissues.
  (d) The difference in survival rates between patients with high and low MEX3C expression
  in cervical cancer. (e) Western blotting demonstrates that downregulating MEX3C
  expression through knocking down circ_0004488 or overexpressing MiR-136. (f) After
  transfecting cervical cancer cells with miR-136 mimics (or miR-136 inhibitors) and
  wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) MEX3C 3′-UTR luciferase reporter vectors, the relative
  luciferase activity was determined. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
