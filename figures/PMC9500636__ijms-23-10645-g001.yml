caption: The glutathione pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The synthesis of glutathione
  (GSH) is a two-step process catalyzed by the enzyme Î³-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  (GSH1) and glutathione synthetase (GSH2) in the cytoplasm. GSH plays a crucial role
  in the protection of macromolecules from stressors, especially oxidants. The reduced
  form (GSH) directly scavenges diverse oxidants and xenobiotics via the action of
  glutathione peroxidase (GPX1-3) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and becomes
  oxidized (GSSH). Regeneration of oxidized GSSG to reduced GSH is catalyzed by glutathione
  reductase (GLR1) (requires NADPH).
