caption: Voxel-wise difference in MD between diagnostic groups and controls (external
  capsule pathway), controlling for age and sex. The external capsule pathway showed
  differences in the external capsule, posterior/retrosplenial cingulate and parts
  of the uncinate fasciculus in SCD and MCI compared with HC. Additional differences
  were present in temporal and prefrontal areas in the Alzheimer’s disease dementia
  group. Voxel-wise analyses of the diffusion data (MD values) were performed using
  non-parametric permutation testing. Identification of significant clusters in the
  data was performed using TFCE. Significance maps were corrected for multiple comparisons
  using a familywise error rate of P < 0.05 (statistically non-significant voxels
  are shown in green). BF mask (in purple) was inflated for illustrative purposes.
  AD = Alzheimer’s disease dementia.
