caption: 'Pathway analysis showing the significantly enriched pathways that arose
  from comparing the metabolomic datasets obtained in M199 and YPD at 37 °C. Matched
  pathways are displayed as circles. The color of each circle is based on p values
  (a darker color indicates more significant differences in metabolite concentrations
  of a specific pathway), whereas the size of the circle corresponds to the pathway
  impact score. The most significantly impacted pathways (p < 0.01), with high statistical
  significance scores, are: (1) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; (2)
  arginine and proline metabolism; (3) glycerolipid metabolism; (4) arginine biosynthesis;
  (5) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; (6) nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism;
  (7) β-alanine metabolism; (8) butanoate metabolism; (9) glutathione metabolism.
  p values denote enrichment of the entire pathway by Fisher’s exact test.'
