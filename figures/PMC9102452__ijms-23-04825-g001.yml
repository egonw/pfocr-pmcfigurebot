caption: ELF4 deficiency leads to an increase in colon permeability. (A) Serum 4 kDa
  FITC-Dextran (FD4) level of indicated mice of different ages and sexes after 0.1
  mg/g FD4 gavage for 3 h. Four weeks, male-WT, n = 2, male-Elf4−/−, n = 2, female-WT,
  n = 4, female-Elf4−/−, n = 7; 6 weeks, male-WT, n = 15, male-Elf4−/−, n = 10, female-WT,
  n = 7, female-Elf4−/−, n = 8; 8 weeks, male-WT, n = 3, male-Elf4−/−, n = 5, female-WT,
  n = 12, female-Elf4−/−, n = 13; total, male-WT, n = 20, male-Elf4−/−, n = 19, female-WT,
  n = 23, female-Elf4−/−, n = 28. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001. Unpaired
  two-sided Student’ s t-test, data are represented as mean ± SEM. (B) GSEA enrichment
  of regulation of vascular permeability pathway between ELF4−/− Caco2 (clone1 and
  clone2 were used) and WT Caco2 cells. ‘KO’ refers to ELF4−/− Caco2 (left panel).
  NES = −1.99. A heatmap of indicated genes in the vascular permeability pathway (right
  panel). (C) Enrichment of differential expression proteins between ELF4−/− Caco2
  and WT Caco2 cells by label-free proteomics. (D) Colon Tjp1 (upper panel) and Ocln
  (low panel) mRNA expression of Elf4−/− mice and WT mice by RT-qPCR. WT, n =10, Elf4−/−,
  n = 14. * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001. Unpaired two-sided Student’ s t-test, data
  are represented as mean ± SEM.
