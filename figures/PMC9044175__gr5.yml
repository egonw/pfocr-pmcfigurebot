caption: Pathway enrichment and cell-cell interactions of Mφ LW-high macrophages(A)
  GO pathways enriched in Mφ LW-high from nonresponders compared with macrophages
  from responders' population. NES; normalized enrichment score.(B) A dot plot showing
  the expression and distribution of ligands predominantly secreted by macrophages
  (in red) that could contribute to the CD8 T cell difference between responders and
  nonresponders.(C) A heatmap showing the potential targeted genes in CD8 T cells
  in response to ligands expressed in nonresponders' macrophages. Ligands with bold
  italic font are differentially expressed in Mφ LW-high only.
