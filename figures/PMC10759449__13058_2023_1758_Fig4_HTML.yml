caption: PDIA4 inhibited apoptosis effects in TNBC cells with/without IR. A and B
  Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells infected
  with lentivirus PDIA4 or shRNA3 with/without IR. C and D Western blot analysis showed
  that knockdown of PDIA4 increased the levels of cleaved-PARP and Bax in TNBC cells
  while reducing the expression level of Bcl-2 with/without IR and the opposite results
  were observed when PDIA4 was overexpression in TNBC cells with/without IR. E and
  F MMP was analyzed using immunofluorescence in TNBC cells of knockdown or overexpressing
  of PDIA4 with/without IR. G and H ROS was analyzed using immunofluorescence in TNBC
  cells of knockdown or overexpressing of PDIA4 with/without IR
