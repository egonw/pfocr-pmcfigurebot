caption: Effects of the TLR4/NF‐κB signaling pathway on microglia in SMIR rats. (a)
  Intrathecal injection of LPS‐RS alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia in SMIR rats.
  (b) Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing that NF‐κB protein
  expression was decreased in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of SMIR rats on day
  10 after surgery following intrathecal injection of LPS‐RS; H3 served as a loading
  control. (c) Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing that
  CD11b was reduced in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of SMIR rats on day 10 after
  surgery following intrathecal injection of LPS‐RS; β‐actin served as a loading control.
  (d) Intrathecal injection of PDTC alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia in SMIR rats.
  (e) Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing that NF‐κB protein
  expression was decreased in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of SMIR rats on day
  10 after surgery following intrathecal injection of PDTC; H3 served as a loading
  control. (f) Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing that
  CD11b was reduced in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of SMIR rats on day 10 after
  surgery following intrathecal injection of PDTC; β‐actin served as a loading control.
  Data were presented as means ± SD. Sham, rats underwent only skin incisions without
  muscle retraction. SMIR+saline, rats undergoing SMIR surgery were injected with
  saline. SMIR+LPS‐RS, rats undergoing SMIR surgery were injected with LPS‐RS. SMIR+PDTC,
  rats undergoing SMIR surgery were injected with PDTC. Ipsi, ipsilateral. Contra,
  contralateral. The data from behavioral tests were statistically analyzed by two‐way
  ANOVAs. n = 5–6 rats per group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus SMIR+saline.
  The data from western blotting were statistically analyzed by one‐way ANOVAs with
  Tukey post hoc tests. n = 3 rats per group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  versus SMIR+saline
