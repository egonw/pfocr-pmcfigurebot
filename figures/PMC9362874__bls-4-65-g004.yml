caption: Aberrant regulation and cell differentiation of primitive malignant cells
  in AML subtype with multiple cell types. (A) t-SNE plot based on RAS of AML subtype
  (AML921A) with multiple malignant cell types along the HSC to myeloid axis. Points
  are color-coded by cell-type annotations. t-SNE plot located on the lower right
  emphasized the distribution of AML cells (colored in red). (B) Heatmaps show RAS
  of normal TF signatures for HSC/Prog, GMP, and differentiated myeloid cells in normal
  cells (left) and malignant AML cells (right). (C) GO and KEGG pathway analysis of
  highly activated TFs of primitive malignant cells in AML921A and AML707B. Color
  shows the -log10(q value). (D) Heatmap shows the RAS of TFs related to the signaling
  pathways marked in red from (C) in the primitive malignant cells of AML921A and
  AML707. (E) Enrichment analysis of cell differentiation related TFs and their targets.
  Dot sizes represent number of genes enriched in each GO term and dot colors represent
  logarithmic transformed adjusted P values (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). (F) RAS
  of HOXB6 and NKX2-1 in all AML921A cell clusters (left) and their overall survival
  curves (right). AML = acute myeloid leukemia, GO = gene ontology, RAS =  regulon
  activity scores, TF = transcription factor.
