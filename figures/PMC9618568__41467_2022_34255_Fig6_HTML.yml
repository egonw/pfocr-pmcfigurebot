figure_title: Expansion of proinflammatory, profibrotic fibroblast subtypes in ADPKD
  kidneys
caption: a Subclustering of FIB on the UMAP plot of snRNA-seq dataset with annotation
  by subtype (left) or disease condition (right). MyoFIB Myofibroblast, PKD-FIB ADPKD-specific
  fibroblast subtype, FAT adipocytes. b Dot plot showing gene expression patterns
  of the genes enriched in each of FIB subpopulations. For FIB1 and FIB2, control
  and ADPKD data were individually shown. The diameter of the dot corresponds to the
  proportion of cells expressing the indicated gene and the intensity of the dot corresponds
  to average expression relative to all FIB cells. c Violin plot showing fibroblast
  marker gene expression among FIB subclusters; PDGFRA (upper left), PDGFRB (upper
  right), COL1A1 (lower left), and FBLN1 (lower right). d Heatmap showing pathway
  enrichment on FIB subpopulations with PROGENy. The color scale represents pathway
  enrichment score. e Predicted frequencies of cell types in each dataset of normal
  kidney cortex (n = 3) of healthy control, and minimal cystic tissue (n = 5) or renal
  cyst (n = 13) of ADPKD patients in deconvolution analysis of human ADPKD kidney
  datasets (GSE7869) with CIBERSORTx. The predicted FIB frequencies in each group
  are also shown (right). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. f Predicted
  relative gene expressions of PDGFRB, ACTA2, FN1, IL6, or FGF14 in FIB of each group
  with CIBERSORTx. Each dot represents a biological replicate for normal kidney cortex
  (n = 3) of healthy control, and minimal cystic tissue (n = 5) or renal cyst (n = 13)
  of ADPKD patients. Bar graphs represent the mean and error bars are the s.d. One-way
  ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file.
