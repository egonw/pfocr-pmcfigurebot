caption: 'NRG1 knockdown suppresses DNA synthesis and inactivates NF-κB signaling
  in trophoblasts. (A) NRG1 levels were analyzed in trophoblasts transfected with
  shNRG1 via qPCR. (B) Representative results of an EdU uptake assay in which EdU
  uptake (red) was used to detect dividing trophoblasts transfected with shNRG1, while
  DAPI (blue) was used to counterstain all cells. (C) Representative flow cytometry
  plots corresponding to the cell cycle distributions of trophoblasts following shNC
  or shNRG1 transfection. (D) NRG1 and NF-κB pathway-related protein expression was
  detected in transfected trophoblasts via Western immunoblotting. GAPDH served as
  a normalization control. Student''s t-test: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'

  promotes HTR-8/SVneo cells proliferation through the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
