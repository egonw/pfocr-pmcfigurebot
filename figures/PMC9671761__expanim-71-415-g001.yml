caption: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) is overexpressed after
  myocardial infarction (MI). (A) The mRNA expression level of LAPTM5 in 3 days after
  MI mice was obtained from gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets. (B, C) The mRNA
  and protein expression levels of LAPTM5 in myocardial tissues at 3 and 28 days after
  MI. Unpaired t-tests are used to compare the differences. Data were expressed as
  mean ± SD. ns, no significant, **P<0.01. n=6 for each group.
article_title: Suppression of lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 ameliorates
  cardiac function and inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) pathway after myocardial infarction in mice.
