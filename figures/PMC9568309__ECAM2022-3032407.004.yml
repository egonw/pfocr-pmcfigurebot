caption: ZJW mediated the MALAT1/miR-200s/JNK signaling pathway regulating drug resistance
  in colorectal cancer. (a and b) Bioinformatics analysis predicted the existence
  of multiple complementary binding sites between MALAT1 and miR-200s. (c) Real-time
  PCR assay of MALAT1 levels in HCT116 and HCT116/L-OHP cells. ∗∗∗∗, P < 0.0001 compared
  to HCT116 cells. (d) Real-time PCR assay of MALAT1 levels in HCT116/L-OHP cells
  treated with L-OHP combined with different concentrations of ZJW. ∗∗∗, P < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗, P < 0.0001 compared to HCT116/L. (e) MALAT1 expression in control or MALAT1
  siRNA-transfected HCT116/L-OHP cells. ∗∗∗∗, P < 0.0001 compared to HCT116/L cells.
  (f) miR-200s expression in control or MALAT1 siRNA-transfected HCT116/L-OHP cells.
  ∗∗∗∗, P < 0.0001 compared to HCT116/L cells.
