caption: HHIP-AS1 OL inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by HHIP. (A) HHIP,
  RUNX2, OCN, ALP and OPN protein expression level after overexpression lncRNA HHIP-AS1
  OL or non OL by western blot. (B) Immunofluorescence images of RUNX2 (red), osteocalcin
  (Green), and DAPI (Blue) in BM-MSCs transfected with NC, HHIP-AS1 OL, or HHIP-AS1
  non-OL. (C) ALP and (D) alizarin red staining after 14 days of osteogenic induction
  of BM-MSCs. The histogram data for each group are the average of three independent
  replicates; bars represent standard deviation; *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001; Scale bar
  = 10 Î¼m.
