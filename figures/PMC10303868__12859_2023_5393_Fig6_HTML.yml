caption: Overall survival curves of KMT2A positive patients in TARGET AML 1031 and
  AML 0531. A Odds ratio of the top enriched Cmap names and mechanisms of action (MOAs)
  identified through EFS Coxph regression analysis. B Overall survival curves of KMT2A
  fusion positive patients in TARGET AML 1031 (N = 220). Patients are classified by
  the ssGSEA score derived from genes affected by the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat. C
  Overall survival curves of KMT2A fusion positive patients in TARGET AML 0531 (N = 46)
  validation cohort. Patients are classified by the ssGSEA score derived from genes
  affected by the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat. D Cell-line sensitivity ranking based
  on IC50 values of Vorinostat. E Overall survival curves of KMT2A positive patients
  in TARGET AML 1031. Patients are classified by the ssGSEA score derived from genes
  affected by the ATPase inhibitor Thapsigargin. F Overall survival curves of KMT2A
  positive patients in TARGET AML 0531 validation cohort. Patients are classified
  by the ssGSEA score derived from genes affected by the ATPase inhibitor Thapsigargin.
  G Cell-line sensitivity ranking based on IC50 values of Thapsigargin
