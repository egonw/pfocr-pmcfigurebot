caption: SQLE knockdown inhibited T24 and 5637 cell proliferation, migration, and
  viability. (A, B) The qRT-PCR assay detected shRNAs transfection efficiency in two
  BCa cell lines T24 and 5637; (C) Western blot assay detected the sh2 efficiency
  of transfection for protein level in two BCa cell lines T24 and 5637; (D, E) The
  CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of shSQLE-treated tumor cells
  and NC-treated tumor cells from 0 to 96 h; (F) Representative images of the colony-forming
  assay; (G, H) Immunofluorescence results showed that the expression of KI67 was
  decreased in BCa; (I, J) The wound-healing assay demonstrated that the capacity
  of migration in two BCa cell lines T24 and 5637 (K–M) The migration and invasion
  of T24 and 5637 cell lines were inhibited by SQLE knockdown as measured by a transwell
  assay. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.
