caption: '“QN” agarwood mitigated renal inflammation and fibrosis in mice with DKD.
  A Representative Images of Collagen Staining in Renal Tissue: Masson Staining and
  Sirius Red Staining, Scale bar = 40X. B The expression levels of Fn1, Col4a1, Kim1,
  and Tgfb1 mRNA in the renal tissue were assessed. C Protein expression levels of
  FN, KIM-1, and TGF-β1 in the kidney were examined using WB analysis. D Representative
  images of renal tissue were obtained through immunohistochemical staining for CD68,
  Scale bar = 40X. E The expression levels of Ccl2, Il6, and Tnfα mRNA in the renal
  tissue were assessed. F WB of MCP-1 and IL6 in the kidney. ###p < 0.001 versus CON
  group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus DKD group. n.s indicates no statistically
  significant difference'
