caption: Diclofenacs impact on squamous cell carcinoma, including the cell membrane.
  Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1), Factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) and cluster of differentiation 95 (CD95), are showing
  greater membrane expression after diclofenac administration []. Both types lead
  to cell death in the same signalling pathway []. Interaction between receptors and
  their ligands leads to the recruitment of FADD. Pro-caspase 8 binds to FADD and
  becomes active caspase 8. Caspase 8 activates procaspases 3, 6 and 7 or leads to
  process BID (BH3 interacting-domain death agonist), releasing a truncated form of
  BID (tBID). tBID translocates to mitochondria and induces MOMP, which causes release
  of optogenic proteins (cytochrome C and SMAC/Diablo) from the mitochondria to the
  cytosol. Under the influence of cytochrome c, pro-caspase 9 and APAF-1 (Apoptotic
  protease activating factor-1) form the apoptosome. SMAC/Diablo inactivates members
  of IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis), allowing proper caspase activation and apoptosis
  [].
