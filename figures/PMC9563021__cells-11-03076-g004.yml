caption: 'Production of IL-6 (A), G-CSF (B), VEGF (C), MIP-1α (D), MIP-1β (E), MIP-2
  (F), RANTES (G), IP-10 (H), LIF (I), LIX (J), IL-10 (K), and TNF-α (L) in RAW 264.7.
  Values are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Nor, normal
  group incubated with media only; Con, control group treated with 1 µg/mL of LPS
  only; BN10, BN25, and BN50 are 10, 25, and 50 µM of baicalin, respectively; BA,
  baicalein (25 µM). ### p < 0.001 vs. Nor; * p < 0.05 vs. Con; ** p < 0.01 vs. Con;
  *** p < 0.001 vs. Con.'
