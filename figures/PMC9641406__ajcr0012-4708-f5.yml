caption: Overexpression of NEDD4 rescues lycorine-induced tumor inhibition in vivo.
  (A) T24_Control and T24_NEDD4 bladder cancer cells were injected subcutaneously
  into the nude mice. When the average tumor volume achieved a volume of about 100
  mm3, the mice were constructed by intra-peritoneal injections of either PBS or lycorine
  (10 mg/kg/day per mouse) for 15 days. (B) Weights of the xenograft tumors in (A)
  were illustrated. (C) In vivo tumor growth was measured by Vernier caliper over
  the indicated time period. (D) The body weights of the nude mice over the indicated
  time period. (E) IB analysis of the NEDD4 protein levels in the dissected tumor
  tissues. (F) CCK-8 assay was performed to determine cell viability in bladder cancer
  cells after treatment with different doses of gemcitabine and lycorine for 48 h.
  (G) CCK-8 assay data showed that overexpression of NEDD4 reduced the sensitivity
  of bladder cancer cells to gemcitabine. (H) A schematic illustration shows how lycorine
  suppresses cell growth and invasion via down-regulation of NEDD4 pathway in bladder
  cancer.
