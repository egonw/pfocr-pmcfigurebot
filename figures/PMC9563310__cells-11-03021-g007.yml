caption: (A–D) Metformin augmented the expression of Bmal1, Nrf2 and target antioxidant
  gene, Prdx6 in mouse LECs. mLECs (5 × 105) were cultured in 60 mm culture plate
  and treated with Metformin for 24 h. Total RNA (A–C) and protein (D) were extracted
  and submitted to RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis with probes specific to corresponding
  molecules indicated. Bmal1, Nrf2 and Prdx6 transcripts and protein expression were
  significantly increased in response to Metformin. The data represent the mean ±
  S.D. from three independent experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; ** p <
  0.001. (E–H) Metformin amplified Bmal1/Nrf2 target antioxidants enzymatic activities.
  Equal amounts of protein isolated from mLECs were processed to analyze the enzymatic
  activities using a commercially available kit. Metformin treatment significantly
  increased cellular antioxidant enzymatic activities examined; PLA2 €, GSH peroxidase
  (F), Catalase (G) and SOD (H). The data represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent
  experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
