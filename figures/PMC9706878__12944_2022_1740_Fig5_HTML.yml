caption: 'miR-667-5p can target SIRT1 to regulate the autophagy signaling pathway.
  A qRT-PCR detection of miR-667-5p level in Hepa1-6 cells. ***P < 0.001 vs. NC mimic
  group. B qRT-PCR detection of SIRT1 mRNA expression in Hepa1-6 cells. *P < 0.05
  vs. NC mimic group. C SIRT1 levels in NAFLD mice were detected by western blot.
  ***P < 0.001 vs. NC mimic group. D The potential binding sequences between circLDLR
  and SIRT1 were predicted by TargetScan. E The binding association of miR-667-5p
  with SIRT1 was verified by determining the luciferase activity. *P < 0.05 vs. WT + NC
  mimic group. F and G The TG and TC contents in Hepa1-6 cells were measured via enzymatic
  method. *P < 0.05 vs. vector + NC mimic group; #P < 0.05 vs. vector + miR-667-5p
  mimic group. H SIRT1, p62, LC3, and mTOR expressions in Hepa1-6 cells were determined
  using western blot and relative quantification by densitometry. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. vector + NC mimic group; #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs. SIRT1 OE + NC
  mimic group; &P < 0.05, &&&P < 0.001 vs. vector + miR-667-5p mimic group'
