caption: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was significantly suppressed. (A) The significantly
  enriched pathways of DEGs related with NSCLC growth were shown in the bubble chart
  by KEGG pathway analysis. (B) A heat map from RNA-seq dataset demonstrated the mRNA
  levels of crucial genes involved in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in H460 and A549
  after ISP-I treatment for 48h vs. control. (high expression, red; low expression,
  blue). (C) The mRNA expression levels of genes mentioned above was assessed by qRTPCR.
  (D) The protein expression levels of total PI3K, total AKT, total mTOR, total FOXO3a,
  total FOXO1, p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-FOXO3a and p-FOXO1 were examined after ISP-I
  treatment for 48h in H460 and A549 by western blotting. *** p < 0.001.
