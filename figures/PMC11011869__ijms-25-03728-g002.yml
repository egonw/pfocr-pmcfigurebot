caption: The two different metabolic pathways of alcohol in the liver, oxidative and
  non-oxidative. Alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, a hepatotoxic compound, by
  the oxidation of ADH, CYP2E1, and catalase, and also produces large amounts of ROS.
  In the non-oxidative pathway, alcohol is combined with endogenous metabolites. Various
  enzymes are produced, including FAEE, PEth, EtG, and EtS.
