caption: '(1) Radiotherapy leads to tissue damage, including immune cell depletion.
  (2) Radiotherapy has a direct cytotoxic effect on tumour cells inducing DNA damage
  leading to activation of the cGAS/STING pathway resulting in: (3) immunological
  cell death (ICD) and activation of inflammatory signals including the release of
  tumour-associated antigenic peptides (antigens), damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs), calreticulin (CALR) expression and major histocompatibility class I (MHC
  I) surface expression. This up-regulation leads to activation of dendritic cells
  (DCs) that (4) migrate to lymph nodes resulting in antigen presentation and subsequent
  (5) priming of tumour-specific T cell and proliferation. (6) Primed T-cells then
  attack tumours located within the irradiated field and in distant locations (abscopal
  effect). This response can be enhanced by addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors
  (ICIs) such as anti PD-1/PDL-1 and anti CTLA-4 agents to counteract the immunosuppressive
  effect of Radiotherapy.'
