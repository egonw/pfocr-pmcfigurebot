caption: UCK2 was elevated by TGFβ signalling pathway. A Gene expression of UCK2 with
  the copy number variation. B GSEA analysis revealed that gene expression of UCK2
  was associated with extracellular stimuli. C, D 10 ng and 20 ng TGFβ1 were added
  to HCCLM3 and Hep3B cell lines, respectively; the gene expression of UCK2 was detected
  in different timepoints using qPCR. E Correlation between gene expression of UCK2
  and TGFβ1. F, H CCK8 assays was used to determine the proliferation of the indicated
  cell lines and the value of OD450 was related to control. G, I The migration and
  invasion abilities of the indicated cell lines were detected by Transwell assays
  in the left panel, and the statistical analysis is presented in the right panel.
