caption: KA promotes mSREBPs degradation by FBW7-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
  (A) The degradation rate of mSREBPs in hepatocytes. (B) The signals detected on
  the membrane in (A). (C) the reduction of KA on SREBPs was reversed by MG-132. (D)
  The regulatory effect of KA on ubiquitination of SREBP-1. (E) The effect of KA on
  the SREBP level was reversed by knocking down FBW7. (F) The signals detected on
  the membrane in (E). The uncropped images were provided i n . Statistical analyses
  were done with one-way ANOVA (Dunnett's post hoc test). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  vs control siRNA or DMSO.
