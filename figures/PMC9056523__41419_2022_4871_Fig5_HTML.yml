figure_title: SCIN is involved in MEX3A-mediated regulation of NPC
caption: A Compared with normal nasopharyngeal tissues, SCIN levels were higher in
  NPC tissues, especially in the advanced stage group. B Kaplan–Meier curves of overall
  survival of NPC patients with high or low SCIN expression (n = 128). C Immunohistochemical
  staining scores of SCIN was positively correlate with that of MEX3A in NPC TMAs.
  D, E Relative mRNA (D) and protein (E) levels of MEX3A and SCIN in four constructed
  stable cell lines were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively.
  F The effects of MEX3A overexpression, SCIN knockdown, and simultaneous MEX3A overexpression
  plus SCIN knockdown on the proliferation of C666-1 cells were analyzed by Celigo-based
  cell counting assay. G The effects of MEX3A overexpression, SCIN knockdown, and
  simultaneous MEX3A overexpression plus SCIN knockdown on C666-1 cell migration were
  analyzed by wound-healing assay. H The effects of MEX3A overexpression, SCIN knockdown,
  and simultaneous MEX3A overexpression plus SCIN knockdown on C666-1 cell migration
  and invasion were determined by Transwell assay. I The effects of MEX3A overexpression,
  SCIN knockdown, and simultaneous MEX3A overexpression plus SCIN knockdown on the
  apoptosis rate of C666-1 cells were determined by flow cytometry. The results are
  presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
