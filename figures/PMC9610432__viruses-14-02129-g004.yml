caption: Innate antiviral immune responses and viral counteraction during FMDV infection.
  Coevolution between FMDV and its hosts has led the virus to adopt a number of strategies
  for limiting the antiviral immune response. For example, it is able to interfere
  with viral RNA detection by acting on the RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2 and NOD2 sensors via
  its Lpro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B and 3C proteins. FMDV also antagonises the host immune
  response by targeting proteins involved in signal transduction, such as MAVS, RIP2,
  NEMO and TBK1, interacting via its VP0, VP3, VP1, Lpro, 2B, 2C, 3A and 3C proteins.
  In addition, Lpro protein of FMDV degrades IRF3 and IRF7, while 2B and 3A target
  only IRF3. MAPK pathway is restricted by the action of VP1, while NF-kB pathway
  is impacted by VP1, Lpro, 2C and 3A. FMDV also counteracts JAK/STAT pathway via
  VP3/JAK interaction and by preventing nuclear translocation of STAT dimers through
  3C. At a nuclear level, Lpro, 3C and 3D are involved in the inhibition of host translation
  factors, while VP4 and 2B negatively regulate ISG transcription. Golgi apparatus-associated
  molecular transport complexes are subverted by 2B and 2C, and some antiviral proteins,
  such as PKR, are degraded by 3C. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 15 August
