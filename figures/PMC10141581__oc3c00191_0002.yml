caption: Construction of functional FrbABCDE biosynthetic pathways for translational
  incorporation into sfGFP in E. coli. (A) Biosynthetic pathway for nhpSer by S. rubellomurinus.
  The first committed step of nhpSer biosynthesis is catalyzed by a phosphoenolpyruvate
  mutase, FrbD, which forms the unusual C–P phosphonate bond. The energetically unfavorable
  equilibrium is pulled forward by the homocitrate synthase homologue FrbC via irreversible
  condensation of acetyl-CoA. The next two steps parallel those of the TCA cycle and
  are carried out by FrbA (an aconitase) and Frbs B and/or E (divergent homologues
  of isocitrate dehydrogenase). It is not yet known whether FrbB or FrbE catalyze
  this reaction, or if both are required.− It may be possible the FrbB and FrbE form
  a heterodimer, or that the two-step isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is decoupled
  such that one catalyzes NADP-dependent oxidation while the other performs decarboxylation.
  (B) A library of FrbABCDE pathways containing all combinations of Frb enzyme transcriptional
  strengths was cotransformed with a plasmid housing all nhpSer GCE components and
  either a sfGFP-WT or sfGFP-150TAG reporter plasmid into BL21(DE3) ΔserC cells. (C)
  Comparison of nhpSer incorporation efficiency into sfGFP-150TAG for the top 5 isolated
  FrbABCDE pathways compared to wild-type sfGFP expression. Error bars represent standard
  deviations of expressions performed in triplicate. (D) Promoter identities for the
  Frb enzymes for each isolated pathway shown in panel C. Promoter sequences are indicated
  in Figure S3.
