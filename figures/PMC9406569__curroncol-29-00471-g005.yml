caption: 'A partial mechanism of action of CTSK in lung cancer. Two pathways of CTSK
  expression are elucidated: first, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) acts as an
  efficient substrate for CTSK to activate the PI3K and Ras proteins. Second, CTSK
  is expressed by directly activating the mTOR signaling pathway, mainly the mTORC1
  complex.'
