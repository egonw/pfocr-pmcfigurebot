caption: GE regulates the changes in the expression of CYT C1, AKT and JAK2 in RPE
  cells under hyperglycemia through AKT/JAK2. (A) WB was used to detect CYT C1, AKT
  and JAK2 expression in each group; (B-D) WB was used to detect the expression changes
  of CYT C1 and AKT in each group after adding GE, AKT inhibitor, JAK2 inhibitor,
  and GE combined with AKT inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor under hyperglycemia (**P<0.05).
  GE, genipin; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; WB, western blot.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
