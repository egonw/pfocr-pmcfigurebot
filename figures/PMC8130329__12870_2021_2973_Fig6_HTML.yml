caption: Heatmap of genes in Old Blush in response to Botrytis c. infection. The bar
  represents the scale of the expression levels for each gene (FPKM) in the different
  treatments, as indicated by red/green rectangles. Genes in red show upregulation,
  and those in green show downregulation. a R genes, b MAPK signaling pathway genes,
  c Ca2+signaling pathway, d PTI genes, e ROS metabolic pathway, f Defense enzyme,
  g SA signaling pathway
article_title: RcTGA1 and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway involvement in the defence
  of rose against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea.
