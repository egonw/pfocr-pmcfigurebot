caption: Differential expression analysis in LUAD patients. (A) Heatmap illustrating
  all DEGs between 535 tumor samples (red) and 59 normal samples (blue). (B) Venn
  diagram illustrating 681 immune-related DEGs obtained by the intersection of 8,108
  DEGs and 3,177 immune genes. (C) GO enrichment analysis of the immune-related DEGs.
  (D) KEGG pathway analysis of the immune-related DEGs. DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; FC, fold change; GO, Gene Ontology; IL-17, interleukin-17; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
