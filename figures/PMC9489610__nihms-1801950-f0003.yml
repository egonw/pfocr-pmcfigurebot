figure_title: Evidence for activation of apoptosis in ALS
caption: Studies using in vitro and in vivo approaches have found that ALS-associated
  proteins (e.g. TDP-43, mSOD1, toxic C9ORF72 dipeptide repeat proteins) and mutations
  in fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) can cause activation of (A) intrinsic apoptosis in neurons.
  Intrinsic apoptosis begins with cellular stress that activates pro-apoptotic BH3-only
  proteins. BH3 only proteins such as BIM and BID, sequester anti-apoptotic BCL-2
  proteins and promote oligomerization of pro-apoptotic family members (e.g. BAX)
  in mitochondrial membrane. Following mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP) mediated by BAX and BAK, cytochrome-c (cyt-c) is released from the intermembrane
  space into the cytosol. There cyt-c binds and activates Apaf-1, allowing for oligomerization
  and recruitment of pro-caspase-9 via homotypic CARD-CARD interactions. The apoptosome
  (cyt-c, Apaf-1, active caspase-9) cleaves executioner caspases to mediate apoptosis.
  (B) Infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the spinal cord, or mutations in TBK1 can
  sensitize neurons to extrinsic apoptosis. This mode of cell death is triggered by
  ligation of a death receptor (TNFR1, Fas, or TRAIL-R1/2), and can lead to apoptosis,
  necroptosis, or cell survival. Following CD95 ligation (by FasL), CD95 binds FADD
  using death domains (DD). FADD then recurits caspase-8 via death effector domain
  (DED) interactions, and assembles a caspase-activation platform called the DISC.
  This platform leads to caspase-8 activation and thus engages the extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. Caspase-8 can also process Bid into t-Bid, which then engages the mitochondrial
  (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis. Upon ligation to TNF, TNFR1 recruits the adaptor
  protein TRADD and RIPK1, which in turn mobilizes additional partners, such as the
  ubiquitin ligases TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 to form complex I. When RIPK1 is deubiquitinated
  it allows for release of complex 1, which can then bind FADD and caspase-8 (complex
  II). This complex can induce apoptosis, or necroptosis in situations where FADD/caspase-8
  are inhibited. TBK1 restrains TNFR signaling and downstream RIPK1-dependent apoptosis
  (RDA). Mutations in TBK1 can lead to loss of this inhibition and enhanced caspase-8
  activation.
