caption: 'Pro A induces autophagy in PC cells. (A) GFP-LC3 was transfected to three
  PC cell lines and immunofluorescence of LC3 was observed after treated PC cells
  with Pro A or DMSO treatment for 24 h. Cells were stained with DAPI. Magnification:
  ×630. (B) Western blot analysis of p62 and LC3 was performed in PC cells treated
  with indicated concentration of Pro A for 48 h. (C) Western blot analysis of mTOR
  pathway associated proteins was performed in Panc-1 cells treated with indicated
  concentration of Pro A for 48 h. (D) Panc-1 cells were transfected with recombinant
  lentiviruses expressing shRNA targeting ATG7 or scrambled shRNA control. ATG7 knockdown
  was confirmed using western blot (left). Western blot analysis of LC3 was performed
  in shATG7 and shCTRL Panc-1 cells treated with Pro A for 48 h (right). (E) CCK-8
  assay was used to determine the effects of ATG7 knockdown on Pro A-induced cytotoxicity
  in Panc-1 cells treated with indicated concentrations of Pro A for 72 h. Experiment
  was repeated three times. Error bars represent SEM. ***, P<0.001; ****, P<0.0001;
  −, absence; +, presence; ++, higher concentration than “+”. DAPI, 4’,6-diamidino-2’-phenylindole;
  Pro A, proscillaridin A; PC, pancreatic cancer; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; CCK-8,
  cell counting kit-8; SEM, standard error of mean.'
article_title: Proscillaridin A induces mitochondrial damage and autophagy in pancreatic
  cancer and reduces the stability of SMAD4 in Panc-1 cells.
