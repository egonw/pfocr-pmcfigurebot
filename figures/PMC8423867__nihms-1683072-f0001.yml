figure_title: Overview of the generation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in cells
caption: The synthesis of acetyl-CoA in mammal cells is mainly from glucose, ethanol,
  amino acid and fatty acid. Briefly, glycolysis leads to the production of pyruvate,
  which is converted into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) through
  a process called pyruvate decarboxylation in mitochondria. Additionally, pyruvate
  can be decarboxylated to acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), which is
  then metabolized into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). In addition to pyruvate,
  ethanol can also be catalyzed into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).
  At low glucose levels, CoA is acetylated using acetate by acetyl-CoA synthetase
  (ACS). Moreover, breakdown of amino acids and fatty acid can also eventually yield
  acetyl-CoA in cells.
