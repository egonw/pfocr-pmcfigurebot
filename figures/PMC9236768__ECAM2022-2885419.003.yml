caption: 'The changes in bone metabolism parameters and serological markers in rats
  after 12 weeks of JWYHD intragastric treatment are described. (a) Micro-CT was used
  to scan three-dimensional reconstruction images of bone trabeculae. (b) BMD. (c)
  BV/TV. (d) Tb.Th. (e) Tb.N. (f) Tb.Sp. (g) The translocation expression of BMP2,
  a key protein in the pathway, was detected by immunofluorescence. (h) The protein
  expression was measured by WB after culturing for 1 week. (i) BMP2 translocation
  percentage. (j) Weight gain of rats. (k) ELISA quantified the content of bone resorption
  marker β-CTX in serum. (l) ELISA quantified the content of the bone formation marker
  P1NP in serum. (m)-(q) The quantitative measurement of protein expression (BMP2,
  P-SMAD1/5/8, RUNX2, OCN, PPARγ). The data were represented by mean ± SD (n = 3),
  P < 0.05 were considered as significant difference: ∗ VS. SHAM group, #VS. M group.'
