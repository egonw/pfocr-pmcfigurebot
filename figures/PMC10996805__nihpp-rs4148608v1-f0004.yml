figure_title: Association of CD133 expression with DNA-repair pathway, related gene
  expression, and a score
caption: (A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DNA-repair pathway. The classical
  GSEA method was employed to calculate NES and FDR values, and the cutoff of FDR
  < 0.25 was regarded as statistically significant. (B) Boxplots illustrating the
  gene expression levels of DNA repair-related genes (BRCA1, E2F1, E2F4, E2F7, and
  CDK 1/2) in the low and high CD133 expression groups within the TCGA and METABRIC
  cohorts. Two-sided test was employed to calculate p-values, and the cutoff of less
  than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. (C) The boxplot of Homologous
  Recombination Defects scores that Thorson et al. pre-calculated, by low and high
  CD133 expression in the TCGA cohort. The cohort was divided into “high” and “low”
  expression groups by the median value. (D) Boxplots illustrating the levels of SNV
  neoantigens, indel neoantigens, silent mutation rate, and non-silent mutation rate
  in the low and high CD133 expression groups within the TCGA cohort.
