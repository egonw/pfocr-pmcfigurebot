caption: Expression of CD44 in sarcoma and osteosarcoma. (A) CD44 expression in different
  types of cancer was investigated with the XENA-TCGA_GTEx RNAseq database. (B) Increased
  or decreased expression of CD44 in sarcoma compared to normal tissues in the GEPIA
  database. (C) CD44 expression in sarcoma was examined by using the UALCAN database.
  (D) Differential gene analysis of sarcoma in TCGA showed that CD44 appeared as a
  highly expressed red dot in the sarcoma differential gene. (E) Expression of CD44
  protein in osteosarcoma cells and normal human osteoblasts. (F) IHC demonstrated
  that CD44 was more highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues than innormal tissues
  ×200. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
