caption: Ribosome pathway schematic highlighting gene expression changes in diabetic
  kidney disease. Gene expression changes between diabetic and reference kidneys are
  mapped to the KEGG ribosome pathway. Each box represents the fold change in expression
  between diabetic and reference in the glomerulus (left half of box) and proximal
  tubules (right half of box). Red indicates increased expression in diabetics. Blue
  indicates decreased expression in diabetics. White boxes indicate that genes involved
  in the subunit were not detected.
