figure_title: CircLIFR inhibits HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via
  sponging miR-624-5p
caption: 'A Colony formation assays show that transfection with miR-624-5p mimics
  promotes the proliferation ability of Huh7 cells and reverses the proliferation
  inhibition induced by overexpression of circLIFR in Huh7 cells. B Colony formation
  assays demonstrate that miR-624-5p inhibitor suppresses the proliferation ability
  of SNU387 cells and restores the proliferation promotion effect induced by downregulation
  of circLIFR in SNU387 cells. C–E Transwell assays show the effect of miR-624-5p
  mimics, circLIFR, or combination of both on the migration and invasion ability of
  Huh7 cells. D–F Transwell assays showing the effect of miR-624-5p inhibitor, circLIFR-shRNA,
  or combination of both on the migration and invasion ability of SNU387 cells. Scale
  bar: 100 μm. Data represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.'
