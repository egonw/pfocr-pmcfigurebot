caption: Combination strategies enhance macrophage phagocytosis. (A) The combination
  treatment enhances phagocytosis by increasing the CRT on the cell surface, or enhancing
  Fc–FcR interaction. Chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy enhance phagocytosis
  by increasing the surface expression of CRT. Some of them induces the ICD of cancer
  cells, cause more DNA damage, activate the cGAS–STING pathway of APC and finally
  leading to T cell activation. Anti-CD20 antibody augments ADCP through Fc–FcR interaction
  after combining with anti-CD47 antibody. Moreover, the up-regulation of CD47 on
  cancer cells by chemotherapy, radiotherapy or anti-VEGF antibody provides the opportunities
  to combine the agents targeting CD47. (B) Some combination strategies enhance macrophage
  phagocytosis by repolarizing the macrophage phenotype from TAMs to M1-like macrophage.
