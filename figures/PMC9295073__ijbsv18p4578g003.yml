caption: 'The ERK1/2/CREB/BCL2 signaling pathway mediated the protective effects of
  artemisinin and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 or silencing of ERK1/2 blocked the protective
  effect of artemisinin in PC12 cells. (A) PC12 cells were incubated with artemisinin
  at the indicated concentrations and then subjected to OGD/RP conditions. The expression
  of phosphorylated ERK, CREB, BAX and BCL2 were detected by Western blotting. (B-D)
  Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots expressed as percentage of control. Moreover,
  PC12 cells were pre-treated with 25 μM PD98059 for 40 min, then treated with 25
  μM artemisinin for 2 hours and then induced with OGD for 4 hours followed by 20
  hours of reperfusion. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay (E), cell apoptosis
  was determined by Hoechst 33342 staining (F, G) and caspase 3 activity (H). (I)
  Cells were transfected with ERK1/2 siRNA and the expression of ERK was detected
  by Western blotting. GAPDH were used as a loading control. (J) Cells were transfected
  with ERK1/2 siRNA, further treated with 25 μM artemisinin and then induced with
  OGD for 4 hours followed by 20 hours of reperfusion. Cell viability was measured
  by MTT assay. ***p < 0.001, versus ctrl group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,### p < 0.001,
  versus model group; & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01,versus ART+ model group were considered
  significantly different. The assay was repeated at least 3 times.'
