caption: MAP9 regulated cell cycle-related genes and epithelial mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) via the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) pathway. (a) The messenger
  ribonucleic acid (mRNA), protein levels of TGF-β1, and phosphorylated mothers against
  decapentaplegic homolog (p-SMAD)2 and p-SMAD3 levels increased in the short hairpin
  ribonucleic acid- (RNA-) MAP9 (sh-MAP9) MAP9 group compared to the negative control
  (NC) group. Also, significantly enhanced phosphorylation levels of SMAD2 and SMAD3
  were detected in the sh-MAP9 cells. (b) The proliferation ability of both 5637 and
  T24 cells, detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry assays,
  was rescued. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and paired
  Student's t-test was employed for data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001.
