figure_title: Apoptosis regulation through protein–protein interactions
caption: The apoptotic pathway is engaged extrinsically through death receptor signaling
  and intrinsically through mitochondrial poration by the effector BCL-2 family proteins
  BAK and BAX. Protein–protein interactions mediate many of the steps in apoptosis,
  culminating in the activation of initiator and executor caspases, the latter of
  which perform widespread cellular proteolysis, resulting in cell death. In this
  review we detail our latest understanding of the regulation of effector BCL-2 proteins
  by protein–protein interactions. tBID was recently shown to mediate apoptosis in
  cells lacking BAK, BAX, and BOK [42], and it is reclassified here as a pro-death
  initiator and effector (*).
