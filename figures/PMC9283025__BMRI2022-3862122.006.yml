caption: 'NOX4/NLRP3 signaling pathway affected the effects of the HUCMSC in vitro
  model of premature ovarian failure by miR-100-5p heat map and combine sample correlation
  (a), volcanic map (b), result analysis (c), NOX4 mRNA (d, e), luciferase reporter
  levels and KLF13 constructed targeting miR-100-5p (f), and NOX4 protein expression
  (g, h). Control: control group; low/med/high: low/med/high of the HUCMSC group.
  Vector: negative control group; miR-100-5p: overexpression of miR-100-5p group;
  sh-nc: sh-negative control group; sh-miR-100-5p: downregulation of miR-100-5p group;
  HUCMSCs: HUCMSC group; ∗∗p < 0.01 compared with vector or sh-negative control group.'
