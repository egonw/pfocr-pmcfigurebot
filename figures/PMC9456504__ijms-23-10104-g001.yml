caption: 'Tumorigenic and pro-metastatic mechanisms of AMPs on gynecological cancers:
  (1) HBD3 and elafin activate NF-κB pathway [,]; (2) Elafin, S100A7 and SLPI induce
  MEK/ERK pathway [,,,,]; (3) SLPI promotes extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis
  [,]; (4) LL-37 and S100A7 induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [,]; (5)
  HE4 controls cell cycle []; (6) A vicious circle between macrophages and ovarian
  cancer cells by interaction between LL-37 and versican V1 []. MEK, Mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated kinases; RAGE, Receptor for
  advanced glycation end-products; EMT, Epithelial–mesenchymal transition; VDR, vitamin
  D receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MMP, Matrix metalloproteinases; CYP27B1, Cytochrome
