caption: Metabolic pathway comparison between the different groups. Summary of the
  pathway analysis with MetPA with all the metabolites at each treatment cycle (C0,
  C2, and C3) were considered. The area with the bubbles is proportional to the effect
  of each pathway, with color denoting the significance from highest in red to lowest
  in white.
