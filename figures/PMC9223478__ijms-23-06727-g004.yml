caption: Increasing phospho-eIF2α level is necessary for npy induction upon lysine
  deprivation. The level and/or phosphorylation of eIF2α, ATF4, and S6, were examined
  by Western blots (A) and quantitated (B) in lysine deprivation for 60 min, pretreated
  with1 μM GCN2iB for 120 min. (C) atf4 and npy gene transcript levels. Band densities
  were quantified by Image J software. Results were expressed as means ± standard
  errors from at least three independent experiments. Labeled means without a common
  lowercase letter differ significantly (p < 0.05).
