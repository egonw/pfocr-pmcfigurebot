caption: Network propagation analysis connects TRAF2, non-canonical NF-κB signaling,
  and HIV infection. (A) Data integration pipeline overview. The top E3 hits from
  this study and human proteins with prior association with HIV were integrated using
  network propagation. The significant subnetwork from the propagation was further
  clustered into 30 subnetwork pieces (or “clusters”), and known functional and physical
  connections between each cluster and the top E3s from this study were added. This
  analysis serves to highlight the pathways and complexes that are associated with
  both HIV pathogenesis and the E3s from this study. (B) Cluster 8 (C8) extracted
  from the network propagation results possesses significant enrichment in NF-κB-related
  pathway terms. E3s from this study are annotated in blue diamonds. Gray circles
  denote human proteins within the base network. The size of the circle denotes the
  −log10(P value) of the propagation result. (C) Western blot analysis probing for
  non-canonical NF-κB activation (marked by the processing of p100 to p52) and non-canonical
  NF-κB activation (marked by IкBα degradation), with a GAPDH loading control in gene
  knockouts in primary activated CD4+ T cells from healthy human donor AR, which is
  one representative donor of three (Fig. S3).
