figure_title: The mean-correlation relationship leads to expression bias
caption: Same data as . (a) Like , but supplemented with the densities (scaled differently
  from the background densities) of the top 0.1% of the correlations in each expression
  bin, representing possible signal. (b) We calculate the average expression level
  between two genes involved in a gene-gene correlation, as a measure of the expression
  level of the pair. The expression level of pairs of genes for either all expressed
  genes (black) or all gene pairs in the top 0.1% of the correlations (gray). (c)
  The expression level of pairs of genes for either all genes (black) or all gene
  pairs with a known protein-protein interaction (PPI) (pink).(d) The expression level
  of pairs of genes for either all genes (black) or all gene pairs within a regulatory
  pathway (green).
