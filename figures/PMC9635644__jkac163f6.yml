caption: Enteric P.e. infection downregulates the expression of many signaling receptors
  and ligands that show brain- and intestine-enriched expression. a, b) Heatmap depicting
  the change in expression (Log2-fold change vs mock-infected flies) of (a) signaling
  receptors and (b) signaling ligands following enteric infection. Grey symbols show
  genes with strong enrichment in either the head/brain or intestinal system, based
  on expression levels from FlyAtlas2.
article_title: Enteric bacterial infection in Drosophila induces whole-body alterations
  in metabolic gene expression independently of the immune deficiency signaling pathway.
