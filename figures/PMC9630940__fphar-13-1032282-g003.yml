caption: GSEA identified IL-6 type cytokine receptor ligand interactions. (A,B) IL-6
  family signaling pathways; (C) IL-10 pathway and (D) MAPK cascade as regulatory
  targets of paeoniflorin in pancreatic cancer. (E) Differences in pathway activities
  scored per sample by GSVA between PF-treated group and control group. Blue represents
  the pathway with t value greater than 2, and green represents the pathway with t
  value less than -2. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, False discovery rate.
