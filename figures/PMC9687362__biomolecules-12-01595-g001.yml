caption: Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis at the transcriptional and translational
  level. At the transcriptional level, the PGC-1α-NRF-1/2-TFAM pathway is the master
  regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Increased AMP/ATP ratio, NAD+/NADH ratio
  and Ca2+ levels, which are part of mitochondrial feedback mechanisms within the
  cell, result in activation of AMPK, PKA, SIRT1 and CaMK that in turn lead to PGC-1α
  stimulation. Once activated, PGC-1α promotes transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
  genes via NRF-1/2 and transcription of mitochondrial-encoded genes via expression
  of TFAM. At the translational level, the insulin-induced PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway
  plays a major role in mitochondrial biogenesis. Via activation of eIF4E, mTORC1
  increases the translation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, which are imported
  into mitochondria. AKT, however, also has an effect on transcription via inhibition
  of FOXO1 and consequent activation of PGC-1α. Furthermore, AMPK is also a substrate
  of AKT, which is inhibited by AKT-induced phosphorylation. Finally, AMPK and mTORC1
  can inhibit each other by direct phosphorylation.
