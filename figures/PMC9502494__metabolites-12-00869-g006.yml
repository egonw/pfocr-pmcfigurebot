caption: Functional analysis of the common significantly altered metabolites. (A)
  The involvement of metabolites in various pathways were investigated using enrichment
  pathway analysis. A list of the most enriched pathways in which these metabolites
  are involved is shown based on the enrichment ratio. (B) The involvement of metabolites
  in various pathways was investigated using enrichment pathway analysis. A list of
  the most enriched pathways in which these metabolites are involved is shown based
  on −log10(p value). (C) The pathway impact is shown based on −log10(p value). (D)
  Heatmap showing the top upregulated metabolites (red) and downregulated metabolites
  (blue) across the control, circadian disruption (CRSD), cocaine, and CRSD with cocaine
  treatment groups.
