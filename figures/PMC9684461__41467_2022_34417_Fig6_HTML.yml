figure_title: Xrn1∆NLS1/2 abnormally responds to changes in the environment
caption: a xrn1∆NLS1/2mutant cells bud abnormally slowly during exit from long-term
  starvation to sated conditions. Seven days starved cells were re-fed (see Methods)
  and percentage of budded cells was plotted as a function of time post re-feeding.
  n = 2 biologically independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation
  (S.D.). b, c xrn1∆NLS1/2mutant cells enter abnormally slowly into S-phase, as assayed
  by Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis. Cells were re-fed as in a. DNA content was determined
  by FACS, and plotted as a function of time post-re-feeding. n = 3 biologically independent
  experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). d Xrn1WT-GFP, but not
  Xrn1∆NLS1/2-GFP accumulates in the nucleus concomitantly with bud appearance. Cells
  were inspected under a fluorescence microscope and % cells with nuclear localization
  of GFP was plotted as a function of time following re-feeding. Error bars represent
  S.D. of 3 replicates. Note that, in this import experiment, no cycloheximide was
  added to avoid its effect on the actual process of exiting the starvation. Therefore,
  in this case (unlike our other experiments), we cannot differentiate between import
  of pre-existing Xrn1 or newly synthesized one. n = 3 biologically independent experiments.
  Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.). e NLS2 is required for Xrn1 import
  during starvation and exit from starvation, whereas NLS1 is required only following
  3 h post re-feeding. The indicated mutant cells were examined following re-feeding
  as in d. n = 3 biologically independent experiments. Error bars represent standard
  deviation (S.D.). p-values were determined by two-tailed unpaired t-test. ns not-significant.
  f Kap120 is required for efficient import of Xrn1 during starvation and upon exit
  from starvation. WT or Δkap120 cells, expressing XRN1-GFP and RPB7-RFP (to mark
  the nucleus), were inspected microscopically. After examining the starved cells
  (Time 0), the culture was re-fed as in a and examined microscopically at 2.25 h
  later. The nuclear/whole-cell ratio was performed as in Fig. . P-value, based on
  3 replicates, was calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test. g Xrn1 induces transcription
  of a group of genes during exit from starvation. Starvation exit experiment was
  done as in a. RNA was sequenced (Methods). Reads were normalized to spike-in (S.
  pombe) and plotted (Methods). h NLS1/2 of Xrn1 are necessary for efficient expression
  of a group of mRNAs during exit from starvation. Genes that were sensitive to Xrn1
  NLSs (red dots in g) were selected. Fold-change of mRNA level is expressed as a
  ratio between the normalized WT and the normalized ∆NLS1/2 mutant mRNA level. Each
  box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values, with the median noted by the
  horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima or a distance of 1.5 times the
  IQR away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever is closer; P-values from the Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test are indicated for each comparison. i Xrn1 import is required for
  normal proliferation rate under fluctuating temperatures. See Methods. Both strains
  proliferated comparably at constant temperatures (see Fig. S). n = 2 biologically
  independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.).
