figure_title: NLRP6 potentiates PI3K/AKT pathway via p85α
caption: a Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from control (Ctrl) or NLRP6 knockout
  (KO) LN229, LN18, and HS683 cells and probing with indicated antibodies (left).
  Quantification of indicated protein levels (right). KO-1, NLRP6-KO 1#, KO-2, NLRP6-KO
  2#. b Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates of Ctrl or PTEN KO LN229 cells and probing
  with indicated antibodies (left). Quantification of indicated protein levels (right).
  ND, not detected. c Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of the interaction between
  endogenous NLRP6 and endogenous p85α, PTEN, and AKT in LN229 cell lysates. d Co-IP
  of purified His-NLRP6 with GST-p85α. EV, empty vector. e The domain organization
  map of NLRP6 (top) and Co-IP analysis to map the interaction between p85α and different
  NLRP6 domains in HEK293T cells (bottom). WCL, whole cell lysates. f The domain organization
  map of p85α (top) and Co-IP analysis to map the interaction between NLRP6 and different
  p85α domains in HEK293T cells (bottom). g Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates of
  Ctrl or PIK3R1 KO LN229 cells and probing with indicated antibodies (left). Quantification
  of indicated protein levels (right). In a, b, and g, all error bars, mean values ± SD,
  p-values were determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test of n = 3 independent
  biological experiments. Data are representative of three independent experiments
  with similar results (c, d), or two independent experiments (e, f). Source data
  are provided as a Source Data file.
