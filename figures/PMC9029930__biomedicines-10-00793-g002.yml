caption: UPF1 variants reduced the tumorigenesis of Huh7 cells. Cell migration assay
  (100× magnification) (A), cell invasion assay (100× magnification) (B) and immunofluorescence
  analysis (C,D) were performed using Huh7 cells infected with retrovirus expressing
  UPF1 variants. Immunofluorescence microcopy showed Ki-67 (red) (C), PCNA (red) (D)
  and nuclei (blue) (400× magnification). Relative levels of migration, invasion,
  or expression in the assays were quantified. (E) The cell cycle distribution in
  UPF1 variant-expressing Huh7 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. (F) Apoptosis
  analyses were determined by WB (left panel) and TUNEL assay (right panel) using
  UPF1 variant overexpressing Huh7 cells (200× magnification). * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤
  0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001; ns, not significant.
