caption: The expression of miR-424 was significantly elevated in the EC tissues and
  cell lines. (A) Remarkable higher mRNA expression of miR-424 was observed in the
  EC tissues; (B) Remarkable higher mRNA expression of miR-424 was observed in EC
  cell lines; (C) The transient knockdown of miR-424 in cells were constructed in
  HEC-1-A cell line, and the mRNA level of miR-424 was evaluated (n=3); (D) The transient
  overexpression of miR-424 in cells were constructed in HEC-1-A cell line, and the
  mRNA level of miR-424 was evaluated (n=3). * means p <0.05.
