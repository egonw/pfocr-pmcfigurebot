caption: 'MS protects mice from OVA-induced lung injury as assessed by airway resistance
  and histology. Airway resistance measurements were performed by a FinePointe RC
  system supported by Huashan Hospital (Fudan University, Shanghai, China) (a); the
  histology shows 10x, 20x, and 40x magnification images of H&E staining of the lungs
  (b); the mucus score was assessed by cell infiltration: 0, no cells were observed;
  1, a small amount of cells; 2, a ring of one cell deep; 3, a ring of 2-4 cells deep;
  and 4, a ring of more than four cells deep (c); eosinophil counts in peribronchial
  (d) and perivascular regions (e) of the lungs from three groups of mice were identified
  by the pink-stained cytoplasm. The data are presented in the form of the mean ±
  SEM (n = 6 per group). ∗ and ∗∗ denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, versus
  control group; # and ## denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively, versus asthma
  group.'
