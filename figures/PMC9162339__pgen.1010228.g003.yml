figure_title: Secondary confirmation of serotonin, dopamine, and anti-inflammatory
  compounds
caption: Each compound was retested in a secondary confirmation assay at 1 μM, 5 μM,
  and 25 μM. A) Ipsapirone, trimipramine, urapidil, and bromocriptine have mechanisms
  of action through the serotonin and/or dopamine signaling pathways and all showed
  rescue effects in the secondary confirmation. B) Mesalamine, nimesulide, and dichlorphenamide
  are classified as anti-inflammatory compounds. While mesalamine and nimesulide showed
  rescue, dichlorphenamide failed to show rescue in a secondary confirmation. C) Drugs
  that rescued lethality in the secondary assay were tested at the most effective
  concentration using a separate NGLY1 deficiency model, Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi. On DMSO,
  17.7% of the expected number of Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi flies emerge. While trimipramine,
  bromocriptine, urapidil, and nimesulide showed rescue, mesalamine, and ipsapirone
  failed to rescue. **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, and * p < 0.05.
article_title: An in vivo drug repurposing screen and transcriptional analyses reveals
  the serotonin pathway and GSK3 as major therapeutic targets for NGLY1 deficiency.
