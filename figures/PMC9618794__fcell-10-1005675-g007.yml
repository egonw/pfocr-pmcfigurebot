caption: Methionine metabolism and methylation in prostate LN-Flu cells. (A) Box and
  whisker plot of metabolites involved in the pathway. (B) Levels of Protein arginine
  methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) determined by Western blot. Densitometric analysis of
  the western blot bands from three independent experiments is shown on the right.
  Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01 significant
  difference between LNCaP and LN-Flu cells by two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test. (C) Methionine metabolism (Methionine cycle, methionine salvage
  pathway and transsulfuration) showing the metabolites and enzymes we have found
  up (red arrow up) or down (red arrow down) in LN-Flu cells compared to LNCaP cells.
