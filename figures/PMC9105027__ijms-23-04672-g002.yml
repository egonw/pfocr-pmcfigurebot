caption: Schematic model of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the superficial
  zone of articular cartilage. Binding of WNTs to Frizzled and LRP5/6 co-receptors
  prevents complex formation with β-catenin, axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
  GSK, and CK, consequently causing β-catenin stabilization. Subsequently, β-catenin
  translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, whereby it binds to TCF/LEF and
  promotes transcription. The genes induced include both catabolic factors for joint
  destruction and anabolic factors for joint protection. Accordingly, Wnt signaling
  contributes to the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis by balancing expression
  of these genes.
