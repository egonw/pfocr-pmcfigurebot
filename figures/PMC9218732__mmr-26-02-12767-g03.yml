caption: miR-1205 can reverse the effect of circ_0006174 on CRC cells. (A and B) RT-qPCR
  was used to detect the expression of circ_0006174 in CRC cells co-transfected with
  circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor. (C and D) RT-qPCR was used to detect
  the expression of miR-1205 in CRC cells co-transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and
  miR-1205 inhibitor. (E) CCK-8 experiment was used to detect the growth of CRC cells
  co-transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor. (F) TUNEL assay was
  used to detect the apoptosis rate of CRC cells co-transfected with circ_0006174
  siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor. (G) Western blotting was used to detect the expression
  of Ki67 in CRC cells co-transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor.
  (H and I) Transwell method was performed to examine the (H) migration and (I) invasion
  of CRC cells co-transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. miR, microRNA; circ, circular RNA; CRC, colorectal cancer;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; si, small interfering; NC, negative
  control; ns, not significant.
