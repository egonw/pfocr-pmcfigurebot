caption: Effect of SA (yellow bars) and JA (green bars) on the relative expression
  of genes involved in early steps of in MIA biosynthesis in H. patens, over time.
  (A) LAMT (loganic acid methyltransferase) from the iridoids pathway and (B) TDC
  (tryptophan decarboxylase) from the shikimate pathway. Error bars indicate standard
  error from the mean (n = 3). Different letters indicate significant differences
  (p ≤ 0.05) based on Tukey’s test. The assignment of the letters (a–d) corresponds
  to the alphabetical order from the highest to lowest relative expression values
  for each graphic.
