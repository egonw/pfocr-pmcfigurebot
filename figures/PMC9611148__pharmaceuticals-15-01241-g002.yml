caption: cGAS/STING signaling pathway in immunity [,,]. Exogenous and self-DNA from
  viruses, tumors and dead cells, bacteria, damaged mitochondria, and genomes are
  recognized by cGAS, then by synthesized cGAMP from ATP and GTP. The binding of cGAMP
  to STING induces STING transfer from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and for self-oligomerization,
  which promotes the activation and translocation of NF-κB and IRF3 into the nucleus
  and exerts a pro-inflammatory effect by the generation of cytokines and type-I IFNs.
  It also induces LC3 to activate the autophagic signaling pathway, leading to cellular
  senescence and organ fibrosis via the STING-PERK-eIF2α pathway.
