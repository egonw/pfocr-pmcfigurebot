caption: 'Sodium cantharidate (SCA) inhibits the activity of breast cancer cells.
  (A) CCK-8 was used to detect the viability of breast cancer cells after treatment
  with SCA at different concentrations and duration. (B) Western blot analysis of
  Ki67 levels in SCA-treated breast cancer cells for 24 h. (C) Fluorescence microscopy
  images of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)-stained cells after SCA treatment for
  24 h (400×), scale bar: 2 µm. (D) Effect of SCA treatment on the colony forming
  ability of breast cancer cells. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 compared with the control group).'
