figure_title: Illustration of the core GPCR signaling pathway and the analogous model
caption: A Key components of the GPCR signaling pathway. Dashed lines mark canonical
  GPCR pathways, though they have not been verified yet in the AWA neuron.B An analogous
  circuit topology that recapitulates the main signaling events related to calcium
  dynamics. Note that S (TRPV and VGCC) depicts a self‐amplifying module to generate
  the pulsatile activity. Symbols next to arrows mark the relevant constant in the
  model's equations. Blue arrows indicate activation, and red lines mark inhibition.
article_title: A negative feedback loop in the GPCR pathway underlies efficient coding
  of external stimuli.
