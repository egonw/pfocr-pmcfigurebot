caption: Enrichment analysis of the DEGs in SWT-treated MCF-7 cells. (A and B) Bubble
  plot showing the top 20 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis results. The larger the
  ordinate value in the bubble chart, the more significant the corresponding GO or
  KEGG result is. The abscissa represents the normalized upregulation and downregulation
  value (the ratio of the difference between the number of upregulated genes and the
  number of downregulated genes to the total number of differential genes). The higher
  the value is, the higher the number of upregulated genes enriched in the GO/KEGG
  pathway results; conversely, the lower the value is, the higher the number of downregulated
  genes enriched in the GO/KEGG pathway results. (C) Secondary classification of the
  top 20 KEGG pathways. (D) Secondary classification of all KEGG pathways. (E) GSEA
  of the DEGs.
