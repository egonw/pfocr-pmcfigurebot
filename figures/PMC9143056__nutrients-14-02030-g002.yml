caption: 'Molecular backgrounds of NF-κB, STAT3, p38/MAPK signaling linking inflammation,
  and degradation. Under physiological conditions, NF-κB is located as a heterodimeric
  complex of p50 and p65 bound to its inhibitor IκBα in the cytoplasm. The upstream
  IKK complex can activate IκBα by its phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation,
  leading to NF-κB release that is then activated (p65- NF-κB) and translocates into
  the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes, including cytokines and
  pro-inflammatory enzymes. The activation of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway by upstream
  MAPKK is promoted by external stimuli linked to stress and inflammation, binding
  to various receptors. Activated p38 in turn results in the transcription of several
  pro-inflammatory genes, such as COX-2, iNOS, MMPs, or RANKL, which are strongly
  involved in tissue remodeling. Another major signaling pathway involved in inflammation,
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway, is activated by IL-6, consequently inducing STAT3 phosphorylation
  and activation, which then translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression
  of many genes linked to apoptosis, inflammation, and tissue degradation, such as
  Bcl-XL, COX-2, and various cytokines. Abbreviations: COX-2; cyclooxygenase-2, IκBα;
  NF-κB inhibitor alpha, IKK; IκB kinase, IL-1 β; Interleukin 1 beta, iNOS; inducible
  nitric oxide synthase, JAK; Janus kinase, MAPKK; MAPK kinase, MAPKKK; MAPKK kinase,
  MMPs; matrix metalloproteinases, PARP; Poly(ADP-Ribose)-Polymerase, RANKL; receptor
  activator of NF-κB ligand, STAT3; signal transducer and activator of transcription
