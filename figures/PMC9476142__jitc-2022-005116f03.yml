caption: FBW7 as a E3 uibiquitin ligase for PD-1 protein. (A) Western blot analysis
  of whole cell lysates (WCL) and immunoprecipitates derived from THP-1 and MOLT-4
  cells treated with DMSO or oridonin (10 µM) for 24 hours, and cells were treated
  with 20 μM MG132 for additional 5 hours before harvesting. The ubiquitination status
  of endogenous PD-1 protein was determined by immunoprecipitation (IP). β-actin was
  used as equal loading control. (B) HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag PD-1
  together with indicated Myc FBW7 construct. Thirty hours after transfection, cells
  were treated with 20 μM MG132 for additional 8 hours to block the proteasome pathway
  before cell collection. The cell lysates were subjected to IP and immunoblotting,
  respectively. (C) Immunoblotting analysis of Flag tag pull-down precipitates and
  WCL derived from HEK293 cells transfected with HA Ub, Myc FBW7 and indicated Flag
  PD-1 construct. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were treated with 20 μM MG132
  for 8 hours before cell collection. (D) Myc-tagged FBW7, Flag-tagged PD-1, and His-tagged
  Ub WT, or Ub K48, or Ub K63 plasmids were expressed in HEK293 cells. PD-1 protein
  ubiquitination status was determined by Flag tag pull-down and anti-His immunoblotting.
  (E) Western blot analysis of WCL and immunoprecipitates derived from HEK293 cells
  transfected with Myc FBW7, HA Ub together with indicated Flag PD-1 construct. The
  ubiquitination status of Flag-tagged PD-1 protein was determined in the Flag tag
  pull-down precipitates by using anti-HA primary antibody. (F) The Flag-tagged PD-1
  WT and its KR mutants were expressed in THP-1 cells. Thirty hours after transfection,
  cells were treated with or without MG132 before cell collection. The expression
  of Flag PD-1 protein was assessed by Western blot. FBW7, F-box and WD repeat domain
  containing 7; HA, hemagglutinin;DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
