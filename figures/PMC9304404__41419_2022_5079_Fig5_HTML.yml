figure_title: Apatinib promoted the uptake and catabolism of glutamine via the AAR
  pathway
caption: A Protein expression of GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway genes in A459 and H460 cells
  incubated with increasing concentrations of apatinib (48 h) was detected by WB.
  B A549 and H460 cells were treated with or without siGLS1 or exogenous glutamate,
  and the protein levels of ATF4 were detected by WB. C Scatter plots present the
  correlations among ASNS (left), SLC1A5 (right), and ATF4 expression in NSCLC patients.
  D Pearson’s coefficient in the analysis of the RNA-seq data. E Corresponding cells
  were treated with or without siATF4 or apatinib, and the protein levels of ATF4,
  SLC1A5 and ASNS were detected by WB. F ChIP assay validated the binding capacity
  of ATF4 to the SLC1A5 and ASNS promoters in A459/H460 cells incubated with apatinib
  (20 μM, 48 h) or negative control. G LC–MS analysis of the relative intracellular
  contents of glutamine and glutamate in the control or siATF4 A459/H460 cells incubated
  with negative control or apatinib (20 μM, 48 h). H LC–MS analysis of the relative
  intracellular contents of asparagine and aspartate in control or siATF4 A459/H460
  cells incubated with negatve control or apatinib (20 μM, 48 h). Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.
