caption: 'Simplified schemes of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. (A) Physiologic signaling:
  extracellular signal → RTK activation → RAS activation (from GDP-bound to GTP bound)
  → dimerization of autoinhibited RAF to an active dimer (e.g., heterodimerization
  of BRAF and CRAF) → MEK phosphorylation and activation → ERK phosphorylation and
  activation. Only a BRAF-wt/CRAF dimer is depicted here, but in physiologic processes,
  there are various RAS-dependent (upstream signal-dependent) dimers that are consistent
  with two proteins in the RAF family. (B) Class I: hyperactive BRAF with V600 mutation.
  No upstream signal is required, and the upstream components, such as RTK, may be
  inactivated due to negative feedback from the downstream. (C) Class II: hyperactive
  BRAF with mutations other than V600. The defining difference between class I and
  class II is the location of mutations (V600 versus non-V600) instead of the monomer/dimer
  status. (D) Class III: impaired kinase function on BRAF protein itself with paradoxically
  hyperactive downstream signaling. The enhanced downstream activity requires RAS
  signaling, which may be either transduced from further upstream or generated by
  constitutively activated mutant RAS. A representative illustration is depicted for
  physiologic signaling, class I, class II, and class III, respectively. However,
  readers should be aware that there are significant variations that still meet the
  inclusion criteria for each class. Created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations: BRAF,
  B-rapid accelerated fibrosarcoma (protein); BRAF-wt, wild-type BRAF (protein); BRAF-I,
  class I BRAF (protein); BRAF-II, class II BRAF (protein); BRAF-III, class III BRAF

  factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (also known as MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase); RAS, rat sarcoma (protein); GDP, guanosine-5′-diphosphate;
  GTP, guanosine-5′-triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (also
  known as MAPKK); P, phosphorylated (activated); RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.'
