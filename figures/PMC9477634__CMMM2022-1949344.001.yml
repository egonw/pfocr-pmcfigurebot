caption: 'CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs significantly inverted Aβ1-42-decreased CX3CL1
  in SH-SY5Y. (a) Soluble CX3CL1 expression in BMSCs was detected by ELISA. (b and
  c) Western blotting determined CX3CL1 expression relative to β-actin in BMSCs. (d)
  ELISA measured soluble CX3CL1 levels in SH-SY5Y under different interventions. (e
  and f) Western blotting examined CX3CL1 expression relative to β-actin in SH-SY5Y
  under different interventions. ns: nonsignificance; ∗p < 0.05 versus control group;
  #p < 0.05 versus Aβ group; &p < 0.05 versus Aβ+MSC group.'
