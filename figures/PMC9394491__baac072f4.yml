caption: ‘Compare Pathway’ section. Five inhibitory drugs of the protein tyrosine
  kinase pathway were selected. (A) In the higher pathway hierarchy (pathway stratum = 2),
  five drugs commonly downregulated the ‘Signaling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases’.
  (B) At lower pathway hierarchy, five drugs showed various specificities for pathway
  activities. (C) The drug information and common pathway results are summarized.
