caption: Differentially expressed genes between esophageal cancer and normal tissues.
  (aâ€“c) Volcanic map of differentially expressed genes between esophageal cancer tissues
  and normal esophageal tissues. IPO5 is highly expressed in esophageal cancer tissues.
  (d) Venn diagram distribution of differentially expressed genes from GSE104958 and
  GSE131027 arrays and TCGA database. As shown in the figure, a total of 15 genes
  showed specific differential expression in three datasets.
