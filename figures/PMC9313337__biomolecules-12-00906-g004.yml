caption: Simplified schematic diagrams of JAK-STAT-SOCS signaling and Clipper-reconstructed
  BNs from the original and randomly shuffled gene expression data. (A) Core paths
  of JAK-STAT signal transduction and SOCS negative feedback inhibition; (B) reconstructed
  BN (edges in red) from gene expression data of paired tumor and non-tumor HCC patients;
  (C) reconstructed BN (edges in dark blue) from shuffled gene expressions across
  samples.
