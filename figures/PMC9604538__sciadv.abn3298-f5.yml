caption: Pathogen entry activates TLR signaling followed by Rubicon-mediated assembly
  of the p67phox:p40phox:p47phox NADPH/NOX2 (gp91phox, p22phox) complex on the vacuole.
  Production of ROS raises vacuolar pH to activate the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis to conjugate
  LC3 to vacuolar membranes. The V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis can also be activated when
  vacuolar membranes are damaged during assembly of membrane pores and translocons
  by pathogens. Several pathogens inhibit this pathway to slow delivery to lysosomes.
  Melanin in the spores of Aspergillus sequesters Ca++ required for recruitment of
  calmodulin (CaM) to the phagosome membrane. (i) CaM facilitates assembly of the
  p91phox:p40phox:p47phox complex. Mycobacterium use a type 7 secretion system (T7SS)
  to generate a 5-nm pore to deliver CpsA into the cytosol (ii). CpsA binds p40phox,
  and p47phox inhibits ROS production. Leishmania secrete exosomes containing GP63
  (iii), which fuse with the phagosome membrane to deliver GP63 into the cytosol.
  GP63 is a metalloprotease that degrades VAMP to slow assembly of the p67phox:p40phox:p47phox
  complex. Salmonella assemble a type 3 secretion system (TSS3) to deliver SopF into
  the cytosol (iv). SopF inhibits binding of the WD domain of ATG16L1 to V-ATPase
  to inhibit the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis and conjugation of LC3. Legionella assemble
  a type 4 secretion system (T4SS) to deliver RavZ into the cytosol (v). RavZ is a
  protease that releases LC3 from the vacuole by deconjugating LC3 from PE.
