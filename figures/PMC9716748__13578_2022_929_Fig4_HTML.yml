caption: Extracellular Ca2+ and P2X receptor signaling are involved in Piezo1 induced
  elevated intracellular Ca2+ signals. A and B Ca2+ signals and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells
  pre-incubated with BAPTA with/without additional application of BAPTA at 120 s after
  application of Yoda1. n = 8, 5, and 3 for control, 1xBAPTA, and 2xBAPTA group, respectively.
  C and D Ca2+ signals and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells under a low extracellular Ca2+ environment,
  followed with Yoda1 treatment, n = 8 and 3 for control and low extracellular Ca2+
  environment group, respectively. E and F Ca2+ signals and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated
  with oATP, followed by Yoda1 treatment, n = 5 and 3 for control and oATP group,
  respectively. G and H Ca2+ signals and AUC of MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with apyrase,
  followed with Yoda1 treatment. n = 5 and 3 for control and apyrase group, respectively;
  Data are shown as mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. Student-Newman Keul’s test
  for panels D, F, and H, and One-way ANOVA was used in panel B
