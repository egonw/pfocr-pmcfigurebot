caption: Biological pathways related to HK2 expression in breast cancer. (A) Functional
  enrichment of HK2high expression breast cancer patients analyzed by GSEA for KEGG
  pathways. The mTOR signaling pathway, which is related to autophagy, is highlighted
  by the red box. (B) The correlation between HK2 and autophagy-related genes analyzed
  by the GEPIA2 database. (C) The protein-protein interaction network of HK2 and autophagy-related
  proteins constructed by the STRING database.
