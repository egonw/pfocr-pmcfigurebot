caption: 'IκB signalling in human skeletal muscle in response to incremental exercise
  to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia, and post-exercise ischaemia. Levels
  of protein expression of (A) Total IκBα, (B) pThr19/Ser23 IκBß, and (C) Total IκBß.
  Nx: normoxia session (FIO2 = 0.21, PIO2 = 143 mmHg); Hyp: severe normobaric hypoxia
  session (FIO2 = 0.104, PIO2 = 73 mmHg); Pre: before exercise; Post: 10 s after exercise
  cessation during ischaemic recovery; Oc1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during
  ischaemic recovery; FC1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during recovery with free
  circulation. For panels (A) and (C), n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx
  (n = 9) and for panel (B), n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9),
  Post Hyp (n = 10) and FC1m (n = 10). See  for a detailed description of the experimental
  phases. The statistical analysis was performed with logarithmically transformed
  data for Total IκBß. Values presented are means ± standard errors and expressed
  in arbitrary units (a.u.). & mean of the pre-exercise conditions in normoxia and
  hypoxia compared with the mean of the four post-exercise conditions (p = 0.008);
  †p < 0.05 vs. Pre Nx; *p < 0.05 vs. Pre Hyp; #p < 0.05 vs. Post Hyp; §p < 0.05 vs.
  Oc1m Hyp.'
