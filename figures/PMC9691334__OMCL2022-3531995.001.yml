caption: 'The Gpx4 expression was downregulated in cultured chondrocytes from OA patients.
  (a) Gpx4 protein expression in chondrocytes from trauma patients (HC1 to HC4: chondrocytes
  from 4 different trauma controls) and OA patients (OA1 to OA4: OA chondrocytes from
  4 different OA patients). (b) The mRNA levels of Gpx4 in the chondrocytes from trauma
  patients (as healthy control, n = 20) and OA patients (n = 20) were examined by
  qPCR. Data were compared by unpaired t-test, ∗∗p < 0.01. HC: healthy control; OA:
  osteoarthritis; Gpx4: glutathione peroxidase 4.'
