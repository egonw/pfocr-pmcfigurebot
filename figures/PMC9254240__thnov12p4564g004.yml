caption: Blocking FGFR pathway inhibited cell proliferation, migration and VCAM-1
  secretion of CAFs. A) The effect of FGFRi Erdafitinib on cell proliferation of human
  CAFs and mouse CAFs for 48 h was detected by CCK-8 assay (n=3 biological replicates,
  one-way ANOVA). B) The effect of FGFRi Erdafitinib on cell migration of human CAFs
  and mouse CAFs was detected by transwell migration assay (n=3 biological replicates,
  one-way ANOVA). C) Cytokine arrays for vehicle-treated versus FGFRi-treated mouse
  CAFs. Boxes indicate the cytokines with significant changes. D) The effect of FGFRi
  Erdafitinib on VCAM-1 level in cell supernatant of human CAFs and mouse CAFs was
  detected by ELISA (n=3 biological replicates, one-way ANOVA). E) The effect of different
  concentrations of FGFRi Erdafitinib on VCAM-1 expression in human CAFs and mouse
  CAFs was examined by western blot. F) The effect of different durations of FGFRi
  Erdafitinib on VCAM-1 expression in human CAFs and mouse CAFs was examined by western
  blot. G) Representative IF staining of α-SMA, VCAM-1 and CD3 in 4T1 tumors from
  vehicle- and FGFRi-treated mice. H) The effect of recombinant VCAM-1 (10 μM) or/and
  Erdafitinib (1 μM) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell migration in presence of CAFs was detected
  by transwell migration assay (n=3 biological replicates, one-way ANOVA). I) 4T1
  tumor growth and CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumors of BALB/c mice treated with
  vehicle or anti-VCAM1 antibody (n=5 mice/group, two-way ANOVA). J) 4T1 tumor growth
  and CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumors of BALB/c mice. 4T1 cells were co-transplanted
  with 3T3 shNC control cells or 3T3 shVCAM1 cells (n=5 mice/group, two-way ANOVA).
