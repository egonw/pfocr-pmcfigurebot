caption: Signaling pathway of M2 macrophage polarization in vitro, blood perfusion
  and histological analysis of the T2DM mouse limb ischemia model in vivo after ADSC-Exo
  transplantation. Western blotting assay of the signaling pathway showed that the
  M2 polarization-associated JAK/STAT6 pathway had been activated (A, B). Blood flow
  in hindlimbs was examined using a laser Doppler perfusion imager on days 1, 7, and
  28 (E). Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher blood perfusion rate
  in the ADSC-Exo group than in the DMEM control group (F). Immunohistochemistry staining
  of CD31 in the hindlimb muscles showed a significantly higher vascular density in
  the ADSC-Exo group (C, D). Immunofluorescence staining of CD31 (green) and DAPI
  (blue) demonstrated a significantly higher vascular density in the ADSC-Exo group
  (G, H). Scale bar = 100 μm; ∗, P < 0.05; ADSC-Exos, Adipose-derived stem cell-derived
  exosomes.

  promoting macrophage M2 polarization in type 2 diabetic mice with limb ischemia
  via the JAK/STAT6 pathway.
