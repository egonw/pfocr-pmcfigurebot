caption: Overexpression of Klotho in mice can reverse the phenotype of vascular endothelial
  cells and the activity of the YAP signaling pathway. (A) H&E staining showed that
  overexpression of Klotho in Klotho+/- mice were able toreverse the phenotype of
  abnormal blood vessels in renal tissue. Magnification 400×. scale bar = 30μm. (B)
  Masson staining showed that overexpression of Klotho in Klotho+/- mice were able
  to reverse the phenotype of renal vascular interstitial fibrosis. Magnification
  400×. scale bar = 30μm. (C) Immunofluorescence staining showed that overexpression
  of Klotho in Klotho+/- mice were able to increase the expression of AMPK and Klotho
  in renal vascular endothelial cells (CD31+), increase the phosphorylation of YAP,and
  reduce the expression level of Ki67. Magnification 400×. scale bar = 30μm.

  by regulating the YAP signaling pathway.
