caption: 'The effect of ATG4B on autophagy and inflammation in HRGECs cultured with
  high concentration glucose. (a) The relationship between ATG4B and miR-34a was analyzed
  via luciferase reporter assay. Versus ATG4B-MUT group, ∗P < 0.05. (b) The effect
  of ATG4B on the level of NLRP3 and IL18 in HRGECs cultured in 30 mmol/L glucose
  for 48 h. Versus high glucose control group, ∗P < 0.01. (c, d) The effect of ATG4B
  on the expression of LC3II and p62 in HRGECs cultured in 30 mmol/L glucose for 48 h.
  All the relative levels of results were corrected by total protein. Versus 30 mmol/L
  glucose control group, ∗P < 0.001. HRGECs: human renal glomerular endothelial cells;
  miR-34a: microRNA 34a; ATG4B: autophagy related 4 homolog B; LC3II and p62: autophagy-associated
  protein; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3.'
