caption: Retrospective analysis of transcriptomic data from mouse and human cardiac
  fibroblasts activated with TGF-β1. (A) schematic representation of the activated
  nodes of the Ras signaling pathway. (B) Expression analysis of the mouse cardiac
  fibroblasts dataset GSE132146 showing transcriptional levels of pro-fibrotic and
  RAS pathway-related genes (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared to
  control). (C) Violin plots showing pro-fibrotic and RAS pathway related genes derived
  from a retroactive analysis of GSE97458 generated from single-cell RNA-seq of serum-free
  cultured human cardiac fibroblasts activated with TGF-β1 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001 compared to control).
