caption: CDO1 catalyzes the metabolic pathway of cysteine. CDO1 can transfer two oxygen
  atoms of oxygen to the sulfur of cysteine, forming CSA. CSA is converted to hypotaurine
  by CSAD; hypotaurine is eventually oxidated to taurine by HDH. In addition, CSA
  is transaminated by GOT1 to produce β-sulfinylpyruvate, which spontaneously dissociates
  to give rise to pyruvate and sulfite. Sulfite is further oxidized to by SUOX. On
  the other hand, CDO1 reduces the synthesis of GSH and H2S by promoting cysteine
  metabolism. CSA, cysteine sulfinic acid CSAD, cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase;
  HDH, hypotaurine dehydrogenase; GOT1, cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase; , sulfate;
  SUOX, sulfite oxidase.
