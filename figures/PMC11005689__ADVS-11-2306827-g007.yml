caption: CSN6 promotes YAP1 transcriptional activity. A) 33%–39% of genes activated
  by YAP/TAZ are also regulated by CSN6. Huh7 cell line was infected with DOX‐inducible
  shCSN6 RNA. RNA‐seq was performed. B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of GSE14520.
  GSEA plot of YAP signaling pathway signature correlated with CSN6 high related genes.
  NES, normalized enrichment score. C) CSN6 KD led to decreased gene expression of
  YAP targets. qPCR was performed for indicated genes in CSN6 KD Huh‐7 cell line.
  n = 3; ***, p < 0.001. D) Relative gene expression of YAP1 targets in liver tissues
  of Csn6 fl/fl and Csn6 LKOmice. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ns, not significant.
  E) Silencing CSN6 decreased YAP transcriptional activity with luciferase reporter
  gene assay (8XGTII‐lux). Luciferase activity assay of YAP in DOX‐induced KD of CSN6
  in indicated cancer cell lines. Cells were transfected with vector or 8XGTII‐lux.
  RLU, Relative Luciferase Units. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; n = 3. F) Nuclear fraction
  assay of YAP1 shows silencing CSN6 increased YAP1 translocation from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm. G) CSN6 overexpression led to increased gene expression of YAP
  targets in MHCC‐97H cell line. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; n = 3. H) CSN6 overexpression
  enhanced YAP transcriptional activity with luciferase reporter gene assay (8XGTII‐lux).
  **, p < 0.01; n = 3. I) Nuclear fraction assay of YAP1 shows that CSN6 overexpression
  increased YAP1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. J) Immunofluorescence
  staining of YAP1 in liver tissues from DEN/CCl4‐treated Csn6 fl/fl and Csn6 LKO
  mice. Percentage of YAP1 nuclear localization was quantitated. K–M) CSN6 KD attenuated
  colony formation, YAP1 target expression, and YAP1 transcriptional activities. YAP‐5SA
  overexpression reversed these effects caused by CSN6 KD.
