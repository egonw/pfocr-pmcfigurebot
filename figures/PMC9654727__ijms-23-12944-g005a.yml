caption: Treatment effects on muscle hypertrophy and atrophy in SAMP8 mice upon different
  time points. (Aâ€“C) Expression of IGF-1, MyoD, MyoG, Myf5 and Myf6 mRNA in different
  treatment groups at month 2, 3 and 4. (D) MuRF1 and MAFbx mRNA expression levels
  in the VIB group were significantly lower than in the Con group at month 4. (E,F)
  Western blots of protein expressions of mTOR, PI3K-p85, Akt, pAkt, p70-S6K, EIF4EBP1,
  MyoD and GAPDH at month 2, 3 and 4. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and ****
  p < 0.0001, n = 3.
