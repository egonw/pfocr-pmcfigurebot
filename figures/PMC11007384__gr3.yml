caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for MOMA. a) The proposed biosynthetic pathway
  for MOM scaffold assembly line driven by the hybrid PKS/NRPS system. KS stands for
  ketosynthase, AT for acyltransferase, ACP for acyl carrier protein, DH for dehydratase,
  KR for ketoreductase, ER for enoylreductase, A for adenylation domain, T for peptidyl
  carrier protein, C for condensation domain, MT for methyltransferase domain, E for
  epimerase domain and TE for thioesterase domain. b-h) The proposed pathways for
  the biosynthesis of building blocks.
