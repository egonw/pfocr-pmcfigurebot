caption: Greater reduction in spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds
  in nob than Vsx1−/− mice. (A-C) Comparison of spatial frequency thresholds of nob
  and Vsx1−/− mice against their wild-type controls. Both (A) nob and (B) Vsx1−/−
  mice had significant reductions in spatial frequency at 4 and 8 weeks post-natal.
  Relative to their background strains, nob mice had a larger relative decrease in
  normalized spatial frequency threshold compared to Vsx1−/− mice (C). (D-E) Contrast
  sensitivity measured at increasing spatial frequency gratings for (D) nob (blue)
  and Nyxwt/wt mice (black) as well as (E) Vsx1−/− (red) and Vsx1+/+ mice (gray).
  Contrast sensitivity in nob, but not Vsx1−/− mice was significantly reduced across
  all spatial frequencies when compared to wild-type animals. (F) Contrast sensitivity
  normalized to the wild-type background strain across spatial frequencies. nob mice
  had greater reduction in relative contrast sensitivity across all tested spatial
  frequencies than Vsx1−/− mice. (G-I) Contrast sensitivity measured at the peak spatial
  frequency for (G) nob and (H) Vsx1−/− mice at 4 and 8 weeks post-natal. Both nob
  and Vsx1−/− mice had significantly reduced contrast sensitivity compared to their
  age-matched controls. nob mice had a greater relative decrease in normalized contrast
  sensitivity than Vsx1−/− mice (I). Data are mean ± SEM and significance is *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001. Comparisons were performed with repeated measures (RM)
  two-way mixed-effect analysis (MEA) (A-C) or two-way ANOVA (D-I) both with Holm-Sidak
  multiple comparisons tests.
