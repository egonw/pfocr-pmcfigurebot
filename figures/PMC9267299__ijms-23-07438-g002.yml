caption: Synthesis pathway of melatonin in zebrafish. Tryptophan is uptake by the
  pinealocyte and hydroxylated by the enzyme tryptophan-5-hydroxylase, generating
  5-hydroxytryptophan which is decarboxylated by 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase
  yielding serotonin. Serotonin is acetylated by AANAT1 or 2, originating N-acetylserotonin.
  Finally, serotonin is methylated by ASMT1 or 2 producing melatonin.
