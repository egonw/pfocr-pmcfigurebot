figure_title: Effect of a ketogenic diet plus gemcitabine on glycolytic pathway in
  pancreatic tumors
caption: 'A: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted on RNA-seq data obtained
  from pancreatic tumors of KG- and CG-treated KPC mice. The enrichment plot for the
  Glycolysis gene set up-regulated by KG treatment (relative to CG) is depicted. Normalized
  enrichment score (NES) and nominal p value (p) were provided according to GSEA.
  B: Immunoblots of hexokinase 2 (HK2) in pancreatic tumor homogenates isolated from
  CD, KD, CG and KG treated KPC mice at endpoint. Loading control: β-actin. Bands
  were quantified and results are expressed as % control; *p<0.05.C: Immunoblots of
  HK2 in pancreatic tumor homogenates isolated from CG- and KG-treated KPC mice following
  2 months of treatment. Loading control: β-actin. Bands were quantified and results
  are expressed as % control.'
