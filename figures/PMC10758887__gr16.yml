caption: Wnt/b-catenin signalling model simplified. b-catenin is destroyed and its
  mark genes are primarily inhibited when Wnt ligand is absent (left). The pathway
  is activated when Wnt binds to its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. B-catenin
  degradation is downregulated as a result of DVL's subsequent binding to the intracellular
  domain of FZ, which causes the recruitment of members of the b-catenin "destruction"
  complex to the membrane(right).B-catenin is transferred to the nucleus as a result
  of accumulation, where it controls the transcription of genes that are regulated
  by LEF/TCF. On the left, repressive interactions are shown. Presenilin increases
  the phosphorylation of b-catenin, Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6 is internalised as a result
  of the combined action of DKK1 and KRM2 ().
