caption: Working model of ELMOD3-Rab1A as a signalling cascade on regulating the Flotillin
  vesicle trafficking that is essential for lumen formation and expansion in Ciona
  notochord. Flotillin2 was transported to the apical membrane by Rab1A and targeted
  to the apical membrane through the transmembrane structure of ELMOD3. Flotillin2
  induced the membrane to bend and to achieve endocytosis. Simultaneously, Rab1A was
  inactivated by ELMOD3 and left Flotillin2. Flotillin2 wrapped the vesicles and transported
  them to the corresponding position. Subsequently, in the cytoplasm, Rab1A transported
  Flotillin2 to the plasma membrane. The molecular signal pathway of ELMOD3-Rab1A-Flotillin2
  was established to regulate lumen formation.
