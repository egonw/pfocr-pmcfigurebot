figure_title: Loss of LXN upregulates PD-L2 expression in macrophage and increases
  polarization towards M2 phenotype
caption: A BMDMs from WT and LXN KO mice were subjected to RNA-seq. Volcano plot of
  gene expression changes in LXN KO and WT macrophages. B Heatmap of RNA-seq data
  showing the up- and downregulation genes in LXN-deficient macrophages (n = 3 mice).
  C GO analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes suggested the enrichment in
  the regulation of immune system. D Representative KEGG analysis of macrophage adhesion
  molecules in T cell receptor signaling pathway. E Relative expression levels of
  cytokine and chemokine mRNA in WT and LXN KO macrophage were measured by qRT-PCR.
  n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. F Western blot showed LXN deficiency
  upregulates the expression PD-L2, PD-L1 and CD163 in macrophages. **P < 0.01, n.s.
  no significance. G Representative FACS plots and frequencies of PD-L2+ populations
  in F4/80+CD11b+ cells from WT or LXN-deficient mice. n = 4, *P < 0.05. H Representative
  qRT-PCR analysis of M1 (IL-1β, iNOS) and M2 (Arg1) macrophage markers in RAW264.7
  cells transfected with CTL or LXN siRNA after induction of IL-4 (20 ng/ml) or IFN-ɤ+LPS
  (30 ng/ml+100 ng/ml) for 72 h. n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. n = 3, **P < 0.01.
  Data are representative of three independent experiments.
