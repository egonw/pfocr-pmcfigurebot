caption: 'Epac and CREB were involved in pyruvate-stimulated FGF21 expression in HepG2
  cells. (A): Epac inhibitor ESI-09 but not PKA inhibitor H89 upregulated FGF21 expression
  and eliminated the stimulatory effect of pyruvate on FGF21 expression (** p < 0.01
  vs. control, n = 3) (B): CREB inhibitor 666-15 upregulated FGF21 expression and
  eliminated the stimulatory effect of pyruvate on FGF21 expression (** p < 0.01 vs.
  control, n = 3). (C,D): Pyruvate reduced CREB phosphorylation without influencing
  the total CREB protein levels (** p < 0.01 vs. control, n = 3).'
