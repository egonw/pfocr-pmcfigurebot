caption: FBXO17 promotes cell apoptosis and restrains cell cycle. (A) Cell apoptosis
  of Ishikawa cells with overexpressed FBXO17 (Ishikawa-oeFBXO17) was much more activated
  compared with normal control (Ishikawa-NC). (B) Cell cycle distribution was detected
  by flow cytometry between the two groups. All experiments were repeated at least
  three times. Data are mean ± SD, * P< 0.05, ** P< 0.01, *** P< 0.001.
