caption: 'Cytosolic and mitochondrial one carbon metabolism pathway indicating the
  available inhibitors for different enzymes. Folate is converted to DHF and further
  to THF via DHFR, a process that consumes NADPH. Serine is converted by SHMT1 (cytosolic)
  or SHMT2 (mitochondrial) to glycine. The one carbon unit resulting from the reaction
  is transferred to THF forming 5,10-methylene-THF, which is oxidized by cytosolic MTHFD1
  or mitochondrial MTHFD2/MTHFD2L to 10-formyl-THF via the intermediate 5,10-methenyl-THF,
  generating NAD(P)H. The one carbon unit in 10-formyl-THF can be converted either
  to formate, generating ATP from ADP by MTHFD1 or MTHFD1L, or metabolized to THF
  and released as a CO2 via ALDH1L2. Formate is present in mitochondria and is used
  as substrate for the bidirectional enzyme MTHFD1 to form 10-formyl-THF, for de novo
  purine synthesis, and 5,10-methylene-THF for thymidylate synthesis as well as for
  the methionine cycle. Several inhibitors have been identified that target one carbon
  metabolism, including methotrexate and aminopterin for DHFR, SHIN1/2 for SHMT1/2,
  and LY345899 and DS18561882 for MTHFD1/2. Abbreviations: DHF dihydrofolate, THF
  tetrahydrofolate, DHFR dihydrofolate reductase, SHMT1/2 serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  1/2, THF tetrahydrofolate, MTHFD2 methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2, MTHFD1/2L
  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1/2 like, ALDH1L2 aldehyde dehydrogenase
  1 family member L2 also known as 10-formyl-THF dehydrogenase, TYMS thymidylate synthase.'
