caption: Effect of nc886 in preventing DAC-mediated cell death(A) Expression of nc886
  RNA quantified by RT-qPCR in DAC-treated MCF-7 cells. nc886 RNA expressions were
  normalized to that of vtRNA1-1. (B) The downregulation of nc886 expression after
  transfecting cells with siRNAs against nc886. (C) The effect of knockdown of nc886
  on cell viability with or without DAC treatment. MCF-7 cells 4 days after DMSO (DAC−)
  or DAC treatment were used. (D) Western blotting of the PKR signaling pathway when
  nc886 was knocked down with or without DAC treatment. MCF-7 cells 5 days after DMSO
  (DAC−) or DAC treatment were used for the analysis. siLuc was used as a transfection
  control (sinc886−), and TUBB was used as a loading control. Quantified data for
  biological triplicates is shown below. In all plots, the average of three biological
  replicates is shown with error bars indicating SD. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
