caption: 'Effect of phospholipids (PLs) on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in
  macrophage cells treated with LPS. (A,D,F): Effects of PLs on the NF-κB pathway.
  THP-1 cells were treated with LPS or PLs. After 30 min and 6 h, p65, IκB, and phosphorylated
  p65 levels were detected by Western blotting; β-actin served as the loading control,
  and lamin served as the nuclear separation control. (B,C,E,G) Three Western blots
  in A,D,F were statistically analyzed. Data are shown relative to the value in the
  LPS treatment group. * p < 0.05 vs. LPS treatment group.'
