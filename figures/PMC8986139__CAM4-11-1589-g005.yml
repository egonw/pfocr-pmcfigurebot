caption: FOXK1 can counteract the role of RNASEH1‐AS1. (A) The FOXK1 protein levels
  were successfully increased and decreased in NSCLC cells after pcDNA3.1‐ FOXK1 and
  si‐FOXK1 treatment, respectively. (B–F) RNASEH1‐AS1‐deficient H522 cells were treated
  with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1‐ FOXK1, while SK‐MES‐1 cells were treated with pcDNA3.1,
  pcDNA3.1‐RNASEH1‐AS1+si‐NC, or pcDNA3.1‐RNASEH1‐AS1+si‐FOXK1. A series of experiments
  were implemented to assess cell functional change (×200 magnification). **p<0.01
article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
