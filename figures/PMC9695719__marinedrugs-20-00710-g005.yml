caption: SC activates Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in glutamate-treated HT22 cells.
  The cells were incubated with various doses of SC for 1 h, and then further incubated
  with 5 mM glutamate for 12 h. The expression levels of proteins involved in Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway such as HO-1 (A,B), cytoplasmic NQO-1 (A,C), and Nrf2 (A,D) were
  detected by Western blot assay. The statistical symbols (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001) indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated group.
