caption: BST2 promoted migration and lymphangiogenesis of EESCs via the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A, B), The wound healing assays (A) and the transwell assay (B) were performed
  to measure the cell migration ability of EESCs after transfection with Si-BST2 and/or
  IL-1β. (C), The western blot analysis was used to examine the migration-related
  protein after transfection with Si-BST2 and/or IL-1β. (D, E), The tube formation
  assay was conducted to check the tube formation ability with the CM of EESCs with
  Si-BST2 and/or IL-1β on HLECs. (F), The western blot analysis was used to measure
  the VEGFC after transfection with Si-BST2 and/or IL-1β. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p
  < 0.001.
