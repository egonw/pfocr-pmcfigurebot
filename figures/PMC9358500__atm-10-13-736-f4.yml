caption: The urinary proteome provides valuable clues for early diagnosis of SA. (A)
  The principal component score plot shows differences between the SA and the control
  groups. (B) The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis score plot
  of SA and control groups make the difference more evident. (C) The canonical pathways
  annotated using the ingenuity pathway analysis software. The top canonical pathways
  included the synaptogenesis signaling, nNOS signaling, and superoxide radical degradation
  pathways. (D) Upstream analysis of the differential proteins. Nine proteins (RAB2A,
  EVPL, ECM1, SPRR1A, GNA/B, EFNA, AHNAK, GNAQ, and GDF) were modulated by the estrogen
  hormone upstream pathway. (E) The protein abundance distribution of the GDF-15,
  GNAQ, GBB1, and GNAI3 proteins in the control and SA groups. (F) The area under
  the curve of the four proteins. SA, spontaneous abortion; nNOS, neuronal nitric
  oxide synthase.
