caption: Pairwise comparison of optic nerve head and optic nerve proper astrocytes(A)
  Volcano plot for all genes tested in ONH vs ONP astrocytes. The top 20 most significant
  genes are annotated. Dotted line indicates the p value cutoff for significance (0.05).(B)
  Heatmap showing the variation in expression level across samples for the top 50
  DEGs, based on rank from smallest to largest adjusted p value. The color code reflects
  the deviation from the mean expression across all samples for the given gene (Z
  score).(C) Normalized enrichment scores (NES, in absolute value) of significant
  pathways identified in gene set enrichment analysis of ONH vs ONP astrocytes. Significance
  is adjusted p value < 0.05. Each pathway is color matched for the broader category
  it belongs to.(D) Schematic of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway from KEGG and
  a table showing in red genes enriched in the metabolism/TCA cycle and respiratory
  electron transport pathway in panel (C). Many of the genes belonging to Complex
  I were enriched in our dataset.
