caption: Torins inhibit the GCN2 pathway.A, effect of sapanisertib, omipalisib, or
  ETP-46464 on Ddit3::mCherry activity. Drugs were used at 1 μM. Shown in each panel
  are WT Ddti3::mCherry 3T3 and GCN2-deficient cells (Eif2ak4-/-) untreated (Ctrl)
  over time and normalized to cellular confluence. The first panel (DMSO control)
  indicated the control for effects of the solvent. Note that a common control was
  used for sapanisertib and omipalisib. B, torin-1 or torin-2 was added to Ddti3::mCherry
  3T3 cells in Leu-free media at 0.1, 1, or 10 μM and mCherry signal recorded and
  normalized to confluence. C, pathway immunoblotting analysis of the effect of torins
  on the GCN2 ISR versus the mTORC1 pathway. 3T3 cells were starved in Leu-deficient
  media for 4 h in the presence of the drugs indicated (0.01–10 μM) added at time
  zero. Lysates were probed for activation of GCN2 (p-GCN2 T898), total GCN2, ATF4,
  p-4EBP1 T36/45, or total 4EBP1. GRB2 was used as a loading control. Data are representative
  of at least five independent experiments. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
