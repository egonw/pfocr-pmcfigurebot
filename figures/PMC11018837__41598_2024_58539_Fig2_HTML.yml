caption: RACGAP1 protein expression in lung cancer tissues and normal tissues. (a)
  Immunohistochemical staining of RACGAP1 in LUAD tissues and normal lung tissues
  from the HPA database. (b) RACGAP1 protein expression in LUAD tissues and normal
  lung tissues from CPTAC samples. (c) RACGAP1 protein levels were determined via
  IHC using tissue microarrays in 75 pairs of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent noncancerous
  lung tissues. The lower right panels show representative images captured at × 4
  and × 20 magnification. Each datapoint in the plot represents one tissue sample.
  Error bars represent the median ± range. T, lung cancer tissue; N, noncancerous
  lung tissue. *P < 0.05 vs. normal tissues.

  signaling pathway.
