caption: The Akt signaling pathway is dependent on MAP3K4 kinase activity.A, ERK1/2
  phosphorylation is unchanged with MAP3K4 kinase inactivation. B, densitometry analyses
  are shown with phosphorylation normalized to ERK2. C, MAP3K4 kinase inactivation
  in TS cells results in reduced Akt phosphorylation. D, densitometry analyses are
  shown with phosphorylation normalized to Akt1. E, PDK1 expression and phosphorylation
  at Ser241 are decreased with MAP3K4 inactivation. F, densitometry analyses are shown.
  PDK1 expression was normalized to ERK2. PDK1 phosphorylation was normalized to ERK2
  or PDK1. PTEN inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 was normalized
  to PTEN protein levels. G, Pdpk1 transcripts are reduced in TSKI cells relative
  to TSWT cells. qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative
  to TSWT cells and are the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent experiments. H,
  GSK3α phosphorylation is reduced with MAP3K4 inactivation. I, densitometry analyses
  are shown. Phosphorylated GSK3α was normalized to total GSK3α protein, and phosphorylated
  GSK3β was normalized to total GSK3β protein. A, C, E, and H, images are representative
  of 3 biologically independent experiments. B, D, F, and I, densitometry was used
  to quantify 3 biologically independent experiments. Data shown are the mean ± SD.
