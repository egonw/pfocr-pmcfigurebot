caption: CYP27C1-knockdown impairs anticancer effect of vinorelbine. (Aâ€“C) A549-shCYP27C1,
  H1975-shCYP27C1, H460-CYP27C1, and the corresponding control cells were seeded in
  24-well plates, respectively. After seeding for 24 h, cell medium was changed into
  that containing different concentrations of vinorelbine (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20
  nM or 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 nM). After treatment for 72 h, NBB assays were performed
  to detect cell viability. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. ****, p < 0.0001,
  ***, p < 0.001.
