caption: 'Fructose regulates the function of VECs through AKT and Src signaling pathways.
  a and b, Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the activation of Akt and
  Src signaling pathways in SVEC4-10 (a) and HUVEC (b) cells cultured for 6 h under
  the indicated conditions, and the relative expression of the proteins was analyzed
  by grayscale using Image J. c and d, The viability of SVEC4-10 (c) and HUVEC (d)
  cells was analyzed by CCK-8 in fructose (20 mM) medium with the addition of the
  Akt pathway inhibitor MK2206 (6 μM) or the Src pathway inhibitor Dasatinib (0.3 μM)
  for 48 h. e, Tube-forming ability of SVEC4-10 cells cultured in fructose medium
  containing MK2206 (6 μM) or Dasatinib (0.3 μM). Scale bar: 50 μm. f, Budding ability
  of isolated rat thoracic aortic rings in fructose medium containing MK2206 (6 μM)
  or Dasatinib (0.3 μM). Scale bar: 500 μm. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD;
  ns, non-significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01'
