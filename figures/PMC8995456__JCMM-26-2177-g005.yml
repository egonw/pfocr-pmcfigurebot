caption: Functional analyses for the DE‐FRGs. (A) GO enrichment analyses indicated
  that DE‐FRGs were significantly related to the function of ‘positive regulation
  of binding’, ‘autophagy’ and ‘positive regulation of cytokine production’. (B) Reactome
  pathway analyses indicated that the cellular responses to stress, cellular responses
  to external stimuli, and signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases were enriched.
  (C) Enrichment analysis of immune characteristic gene sets
