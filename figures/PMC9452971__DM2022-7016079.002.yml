caption: Silencing of SEC61G inhibits proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro.
  (a) The transfection efficiency of SEC61G was detected by transfecting SiHa (SiHa-shSEC61G)
  and control group (shNC) with SEC61G knockout shRNA. (b) EdU proliferation assay.
  (c) Transwell detection of invasive ability of CC cells. After 48 h, crystal violet
  staining was performed and counted. 200x. (d) Detection of E-cadherin expression.
  (e) Vimentin expression detection. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. shNC
  group.
