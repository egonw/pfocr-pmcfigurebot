caption: 'The effects of SQW on the protein expression level of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. (A) Band diagram of PI3K pathway-related proteins. (B) The effect of SQW
  on the expression level of PI3K protein. (C) The effect of SQW on the expression
  level of PDK1 protein. (D) The effect of SQW on the phosphorylation level of AKT
  protein. (E) The effect of SQW on the expression level of GSK3β protein. All of
  the results are expressed as means ± SD, n = 3 per group. Compared with the control
  group, # p < 0.05, ###p < 0.001; compared with the STZ induced group, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.0001.'
