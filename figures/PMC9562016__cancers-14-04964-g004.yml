caption: The inhibition effect of BR102 on TGF-β signaling pathway. (A) BR102 blocked
  the interaction of TGF-β1 with TGF-βRII. (B) BR102 inhibited TGF-β1-induced SMAD
  signaling in a TGF-β/SMAD luciferase reporter gene assay. (C) BR102 reversed TGF-β1
  induced proliferation inhibition of TF-1 cells.
