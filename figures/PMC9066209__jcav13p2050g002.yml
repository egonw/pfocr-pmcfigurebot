caption: 'CuI inhibited the proliferation of PDAC cells. (A-B) Detection by fluorescence
  microscopy of EdU (green) incorporated into the DNA of cultured BXPC-3 and CFPAC-1cells,
  scale bar: 200 µm. The nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (blue). (C-D) The EdU
  positive rate of BXPC-3 and CFPAC-1 cells. (E) The colony formation assays of BXPC-3
  and CFPAC-1 cells treated with different concentration (0-0.5 µM) of CuI. (F) The
  number of clones of BXPC-3 and CFPAC-1 cells.'
