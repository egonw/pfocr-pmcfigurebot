caption: Western blotting and transwell assays showed that XAV-939 blocked the H3.3K27M-induced
  upregulation of β-catenin/USP1/EZH2 signaling and promotion of migration and invasion.
  Representative blots (A) and histograms (B) of β-catenin, P-β-catenin, USP1 and
  EZH2 levels after XAV-939 addition in U87 and LN229 cells. Representative images
  (C) and statistical graph (D) of transwell migration and invasion results after
  XAV-939 treatment of U87 and LN229 cells. The vehicle DMSO had no obvious effect
  on the signaling pathway. The concentration of XAV-939 was 20 μM for 48 h. (E) Western
  blotting assays showed that the PKA inhibitor H-89 blocks the H3.3K27M-induced increase
  in β-catenin (Ser675) phosphorylation. (F) Schematic model illustrating the role
  of H3.3K27M in glioma tumor development. * p < 0.05; ns indicates no statistical
  significance.
