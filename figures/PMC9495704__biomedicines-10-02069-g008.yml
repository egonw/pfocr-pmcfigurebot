caption: 'Graphic representation of the major metabolic changes related to glycolysis,
  pentose–phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle in iPSCs and DA neurons at
  days 24, 45 and 60 of differentiation: glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-P; DHAP/GAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  R-X-Ru-5P, ribose-5-phosphate/xylulose-5-phosphate/ribulose-5-phosphate; acetyl-CoA,
  acetyl coenzyme A; αKG, α-ketoglutarate. Data represent mean ± SEM from at least
  triplicates of cultures from iPSCs and DA neurons at days 24, 45 and 60 of differentiation.
  * Significant v. iPSCs, # significant v. 24 days.'
