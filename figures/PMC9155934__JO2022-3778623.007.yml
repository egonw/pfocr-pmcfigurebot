caption: MAP9 regulates growth 1/synthesis (G1/S) transition-related genes. (a) Quantitative
  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to measure
  the levels of the genes cyclin D1, cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2),
  CDK4, CDK6, CDK inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B; also named p15), CDKN1A (also named p21),
  CDKN1C (also named p57), cell division cycle 25 A (CDC25A; also named p16), retinoblastoma
  transcriptional corepressor 1 (Rb1), and E2F transcription factor (E2F1) in the
  sh-ctrl (control group) and short hairpin ribonucleic acid- (RNA-) MAP9 (sh-MAP9)
  MAP9 cells. (b) Western blotting was conducted to measure cyclin D1, cyclin E1,
  CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN2B, CDKN1A, CDKN1C, CDC25A, E2F1, and pRb1 protein levels
  in the sh-ctrl and sh-MAP9 T24 cells. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD), and paired Student's t-test was employed for data analysis. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
