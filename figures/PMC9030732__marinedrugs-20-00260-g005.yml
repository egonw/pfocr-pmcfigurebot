caption: 'RNA-Seq analysis of DEGs in colon of the Cont, AD and PC100 group mice:
  (A) Venn diagram of DEGs; (B) volcanogram of DEGs, left, Cont vs. AD, right, AD
  vs. PC100; (C) Up-regulated DEGs; (D) Down-regulated DEGs in PC100 group mice were
  selected and validated by qPCR analysis; (E) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs identified
  from AD vs. PC100; (F) qPCR evaluation of the expression of IL-17 pathway members
  Il-17a and Il-17f relative to that of Gapdh. Three replicates were carried out in
  the qPCR analysis (n = 3). #p < 0.01; ##p < 0.01; ###p < 0.001 vs. Cont group; *
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 vs. AD group.'
