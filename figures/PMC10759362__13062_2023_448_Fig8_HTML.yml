caption: MAPK/ERK pathway is activated by PGK1. a The RNA-seq data was visualized
  using Volcano plots. b The Heatmap was generated with the RNA-seq data. c GO analysis
  of DEGs. d KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs. e The ERK and p-ERK expression levels
  were detected through the utilization of Western blotting. f The CCK-8 assay was
  employed to accomplish the assessment of cell proliferation. g The execution of
  monitoring cell colony-forming ability was achieved by utilizing the colony formation
  assay. h The Transwell assay was utilized for the measurement of cell migration
  and invasion. *P < 0.05,**P < 0.01
