caption: Effect of LXB4 treatment on lipoxin pathway in human brain astrocytes. (A)
  Astrocyte reactivity genes analyzed by qPCR. The results were normalized to GAPDH.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, n = 3–4. (B) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of LCN2 and 5-LOX. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI. (C) LC‒MS/MS-based lipidomic
  quantification of endogenous lipid mediators, n = 4–5. (Ctrl-untreated control astrocytes,
  RA- reactive astrocytes). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Dysregulation of neuroprotective lipoxin pathway in astrocytes in response
  to cytokines and ocular hypertension​.
