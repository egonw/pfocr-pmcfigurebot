caption: 'CrrAB activation led to an increased level of palmitoyltransferase PagP
  and Mla system proteins. A: The identified biosynthetic and metabolic pathway of
  bacterial phospholipid. Proteins in blue, red, and gray, respectively, represented
  proteins that were unaltered, upregulated, and unidentified in the crrB mutant compared
  with the wild type. B: The expression of Mla system proteins including MlaB, MlaD,
  MlaE, and MlaF were upregulated in the crrB mutant. C: The expression of enzymes
  that mediate the synthesis and metabolism of phospholipids in K. pneumoniae. D:
  The expression of acyltransferases identified in the K. pneumoniae that were hypothesized
  to mediate the synthesis of acyl-PG had no difference between WT and crrB mutant.
  The experiment was repeated three times with two technical replicates each and the
  proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018528.'
