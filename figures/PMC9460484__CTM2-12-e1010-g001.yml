caption: Transcriptomic analysis of kidney interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy
  (IFTA) at a single‐cell level and the transcriptional heterogeneity of proximal
  tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). (A) Unbiased clustering of cells from all samples
  by t‐SNE; (B) a bubble plot of the expression of markers for specific populations
  of cells; (C) the relative cell proportion across three IFTA grades; (D) the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) among the cell population of the IFTA samples compared to
  others. The labelled genes were the top five upregulated or downregulated DEGs ranked
  by the average log2FC; (E) a circle plot showing the top three changed pathways
  and the corresponding top regulated genes according to the enrichment analysis based
  on DEGs in (D) of PTECs; (F) the results of the GSVA regarding pathway activity
  across different samples visualized by a heat map. The analysis was based on the
  Hallmark of the MSigDB database; (G) the results of the GSVA of the pathway activity
  in the IFTA group compared to others visualized by a bar plot. The analysis was
  based on KEGG of the MSigDB database; (H) AUCell was used to visualize the relatively
  upregulated activity of the cell differentiation‐related pathways (NOTCH and WNT‐β‐catenin)
  with the progression of IFTA; (I) the metabolic pathway activity score of PTECs
  was determined by the scMetabolism method. PTECs showed lower glucose and lipid
  metabolism but higher arginine and glutamate metabolism with the development of
  IFTA; (J) an interaction network analysis of the transcriptional heterogeneous hub
  genes for IFTA was performed based on WGCNA. The hub genes are listed on the right.
  The degree layout represents the number of interactions of the hub genes
