caption: '3-MA treatment attenuates the antioxidant effect of CUR. (A) Histogram of
  ROS was measured with a flow cytometer for the Con, HG and HG+CUR, HG+3MA and HG+CUR+3MA
  groups. (B) The fluorescence intensity was measured for the five groups. Each error
  bar is the standard deviation of the mean. Significance level between two test conditions:
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01. CUR, curcumin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Con, control group
  treated with 5.5 mmol/l glucose; HG, high glucose group treated with 33 mmol/l glucose.'
article_title: Curcumin activates autophagy and attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis
  in HUVECs through the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway.
