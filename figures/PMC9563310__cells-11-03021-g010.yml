caption: Enhanced Bmal1 and Nrf2-mediated phase II enzymes expression and activities
  were observed in Metformin-treated SRA-hLECs. (A–E) Expression of Bmal1 and Nrf2,
  and target antioxidant genes, Prdx6, Catalase and SOD1 transcripts were increased
  in Metformin-treated SRA-hLECs. SRA-hLECs (5 × 105) were cultured in 60 mm culture
  plate and treated with Metformin as indicated. Total RNA was isolated and subjected
  for mRNA analyses with specific gene primers of the above-noted molecules. Histograms
  represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated;
  ** p < 0.001. (F) Metformin elevated the expression of Bmal1 and Nrf2, and their
  target genes, such as Prdx6 in SRA-hLECs. SRA-hLECs (5 × 105) were cultured in 60
  mm culture plate and treated with 1 mM of Metformin for 24 h. Total protein was
  isolated and subjected for Western analyses using the specific antibodies of the
  above-noted molecules. Tubulin was used as a loading control. The histogram shows
  the densitometric analysis of protein bands which was normalized with corresponding
  tubulin loading control levels. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; ** p < 0.001. (G–J)
  Enhanced activities of aiPLA2, GSH Peroxidase, Catalase and SOD were observed in
  Metformin-treated SRA-hLECs. Total protein was isolated as mentioned above and subjected
  for enzymatic activities using commercially available kits. The data represent the
  mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. (K) Increased accumulation of Nrf2 was present in nucleus
  in LECs treated with Metformin. SRA-hLECs were treated with different concentrations
  of Metformin as indicated. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts containing an equal amount
  of protein were used for Western analysis using antibodies specific to Nrf2, Tubulin
  and laminB1 antibodies. To evaluate the quality of cytoplasmic-nuclear separation,
  LaminB1 and Tubulin expression were analyzed in both cytosol and nuclear extract.
  Relative density of the protein bands normalized with corresponding loading control
  were presented as histograms. Untreated vs. Metformin-treated; * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.001. (L) Transactivation analysis revealed that Nrf2 was upregulated by Metformin.
  Metformin-treated SRA-hLECs showed a significant increase in Nrf2′s DNA-binding
  activity to its response element, ARE. SRA-hLECs were treated with different concentrations
  of Metformin for 24 h, nuclear extracts were analyzed for Nrf2-ARE binding by a
  commercially available kit. An equal amount of nuclear extracts protein was processed
  and assayed for Nrf2 activity using anti-Nrf2 (orange bars) or IgG control (blue
  bars) antibodies according to company’s protocol (Active motif). All histograms
  are presented as mean ± S.D. values derived from three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001.
