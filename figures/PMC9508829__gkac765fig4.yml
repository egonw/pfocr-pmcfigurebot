caption: Full factorial design of iTRDL and cTRDL devices matching downstream pathway
  nodes to adapt to the optimal upstream module for the fine-tuning synthesis of MJ
  from methanol. (A) The biosynthetic pathway of MJ consisting of the upstream DML
  module and the downstream DML to MJ module was reassembled. The upstream module
  is described in Figure . The defined downstream module carries sLovA and CPR that
  mediate double oxidation steps to transform DML to the final product MJ (). (B)
  Design scheme for fine-tuning production of MJ by iTRDL and cTRDL devices. The Opt
  strain from Figure  was used as the parent host. We employed the LexA–Mit1AD-derived
  devices in the downstream module to avoid the cross-talk with LacI–Mxr1AD in the
  upstream module. The subset of LexA–Mit1AD-derived devices from cTRDL and from iTRDL
  were used. The corresponding hybrid promoters of lexOnHAmcA (various numbers of
  lexO and the HA spacer linked with cPAOX1) were used for differential expression
  of sLovA and CPR, respectively. Time profiles of cell growth of strain Opt equipped
  with the downstream cTRDL driving module (C) and iTRDL driving module (D). We selected
  constitutive devices (C128, C133 and C57 in Figure ) of three varying strengths
  [100% (1.0-fold), 250% (2.5-fold) and 520% (5.2-fold) relative to PAOX1] and methanol-inducible
  devices (I38, I43, I48 in Figure ) of three varying strengths [100% (1.0-fold),
  ∼250% (2.5-fold) and 500% (5.0-fold) relative to PAOX1] from the subset of LexA–Mit1AD-derived
  devices described in (B). Full factorial constitutive or inducible devices matching
  downstream pathway nodes were designed. It resulted in two groups of single-copy
  strains, i.e. Pp/iTRDL-BCGN_cTRDL-sAR (OC1–OC9) and Pp/iTRDL-BCGN_iTRDL-sAR (OI1–OI9)
  (E and F). These strains were grown in glucose medium (YPD) and then shifted to
  methanol medium (YNMB) to the final density at an OD600 of 10.0 for incubation.
  As a control, two previously constructed high-production strains, i.e. J1 (single
  copy of sLovA and CPR expressed in D9) and J9 (multicopy of sLovA and CPR expressed
  in D9), were used, in which each biosynthetic gene was driven by the native PAOX1
  separately (,). (E and F) The titre of the final product MJ and the intermediates
  of DML and ML were analysed after 96 h culture of the OC strains (E) and OI strains
  (F). N.D., not detected. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three
  biological replicates assayed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical significance
  of the MJ titre of OC4 and OI4, relative to other corresponding strains, is shown
  (*P<0.05).
