caption: 'Effect of iopromide and Sal B in HK-2 cell viability. (a) Several doses
  of iopromide were found to cause a significant decrease in cell viability n = 5.
  Data are the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group. (b) Different doses
  of Sal B were found to reduce HK-2 cells against iopromide-induced injury. n = 5.
  Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs.
  150 mgI/mL iopromide group. Several concentrations of Sal B counteracted iopromide-induced
  apoptosis, Bax/Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in HK-2 cells. (c, d)
  Sal B counteracted the iopromide-induced apoptosis. n = 6. Data are the mean ± SD.
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group. (e) The protein levels
  of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly increased in iopromide-treated
  cells. These changes were lowered in the 100 μmol/L Sal B group n = 3. Data are
  the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs.
  iopromide group.'
