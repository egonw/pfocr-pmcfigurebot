caption: 'The effect of Spike protein on potentiating platelet aggregation is via
  ROS-mediated signaling pathway. Human gel-filtered platelets were incubated with
  1 mM NAC for 20 min, then incubated with spike protein for 10 min or CoQ10 for 50
  min. All the samples then were activated with 0.1 U/mL thrombin, and the platelet
  aggregation was monitored for 5 min. (a) Representative traces and (b) summary data
  were presented (n = 6). Data are presented as mean Â± SEM. # p < 0.05 indicates a
  significant difference between two groups. NS, no significant difference between
  two groups.'
