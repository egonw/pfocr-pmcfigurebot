caption: NIT-1 and INS-1 β cells express components of TNFα pathway signaling. A)
  Schematic of TNFα death signaling pathways as described in non-islet cell types.
  B)Tnfrsf1a, Ripk1, Casp8, Ripk3 and Mlkl RNA expression were quantified in NIT-1
  (circles), INS-1 (squares), and NIH-3T3 (triangles) cells, normalized to 18S rRNA
  levels, and expressed as ΔCT of the gene of interest (n = 3). C) NIT-1 and INS-1
  β cells express TNFR1, RIPK1, CASP8, RIPK3 and MLKL protein, as visualized by duplicate
  immunoblot analysis of 20 μg of protein from total cell lysates.
article_title: RIPK1 and RIPK3 regulate TNFα-induced β-cell death in concert with
  caspase activity.
