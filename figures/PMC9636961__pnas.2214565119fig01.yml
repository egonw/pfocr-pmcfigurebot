caption: swap1-1 is hyposensitive to red light and acts in the same genetic pathway
  as sfps and rrc1. (A) Fluence rate response curve shows the hypocotyl length of
  4-d-old seedlings grown under either continuous dark or continuous red light of
  different fluence rate. Error bars indicate SEM (n > 30), and asterisks indicate
  significant difference compared to Col-0 (P < 0.05) based on Student’s t test. (B
  and C) Digital images of representative seedlings (B) and bar graph showing hypocotyl
  lengths (C) of different genotypes grown under either continuous dark or continuous
  red light (7 µmolm−2s−1) for 4 d. Bars indicate mean length in millimeters, and
  error bars indicate SD. Statistical significance among different genotypes was determined
  using single-factor ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis and is indicated
  by different letters.
