caption: Functional prediction analysis by ncFANs 2.0 algorithm  of the upregulated
  lncRNAs observed in SARS-CoV-2 patients with high viral loads. A, GO-term enrichment
  analysis performed with ncFANs and filtered by removal of the redundant terms with
  REVIGO . The filtered GO-terms are classified according to their two-dimensional
  arbitrary semantic space and represented by symbols with dimensions proportional
  to the LogSize, showing the most relevant GO-terms for the context of viral infections.
  B, pathway enrichment analysis by ncFANs using the KEGG database. C, molecular signature
  analysis by ncFANs using the MSigDB database.
article_title: The interplay between lncRNAs, RNA-binding proteins and viral genome
  during SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals strong connections with regulatory events involved
  in RNA metabolism and immune response.
