caption: 'Overexpression of TP53INP2 induces apoptosis in ACHN cells through a nonautophagy
  dependent pathway. (a) The number of autophagic vacuoles in ACHN cells treated with
  TP53INP2, mTOR inhibitor Torin1, and TP53INP2+Torin1. (b) and (c) The levels of
  autophagy-related proteins (TP53INP2, p-mTOR, mTOR, LC3, and p62) were evaluated
  with western blot. (d) and (e) The expression intensity of LC3 was estimated with
  immunofluorescence. (f) and (g) The levels of proapoptotic protein in ACHN cells
  treated with TP53INP2, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), and TP53INP2+CQ. (h)
  and (i) Flow cytometry assay was performed for the detection on the apoptosis rate
  between different groups. Data are presented as mean ± SD of three or four independent
  experiments. ∗P < 0.05, compared to control; #P < 0.05, compared to TP53INP2; △P
  < 0.05, compared to Torin1 in (c) and (e), compared to CQ in (i), and P < 0.05,
  compared to CQ in G.'
