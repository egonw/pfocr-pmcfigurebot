figure_title: Altered metabolites in Fna treated mice
caption: a, Plots show the log2-transformed fold change in metabolite level between
  treatment arms by the -log10(p-value). Points indicate individual metabolites colored
  by their metabolic categorization. Dotted lines indicate the threshold of significant
  gene expression, defined as log2-transformed fold change ≥ 0.58 and ≤ −0.58 (vertical
  lines) and a -log10(p-value) ≥ 1.30 (horizontal line). Statistical analysis performed
  on natural log-transformed values using one-sided T-test. b, Clustered heatmap of
  top fifty metabolites across study arms. Dendrogram groups individual samples by
  similarity of metabolite profile. Bar color for each sample indicates treatment
  arm, vehicle control (grey), Fna C1-treated (green), or Fna C2-treated (lavender).
  c, Schematic of glutathione metabolic pathway. d, Plot demonstrates the ratio between
  oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione levels for each treatment arm, vehicle
  control (grey), Fna C1-treated (green), or Fna C2-treated (lavender); n = 4 mice
  per arm. Data is plotted as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis performed using one-way
  ANOVA. e, Schematic of eicosanoid metabolic pathway.
