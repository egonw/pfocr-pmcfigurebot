caption: 'FA + p-CA inhibit the expression of glycolysis-related lncRNA 495810. (A)
  Cluster analysis showing differentially expressed lncRNA expression in the L groups
  and H groups compared with the C groups. The red letters show that lncRNA 495810
  (named after its ENST ID: ENST00000495810) is the lncRNA of interest in this study.
  (B) KEGG and the Reactome pathway knowledgebase analysis between C groups and the
  L groups. The red box shows that genes are enriched in the glycolytic pathway. (C,D)
  The expression of lncRNA 495810 was measured in AOM/DSS mice (C), HCT116 and HT-29
  cells (D) treated with FA + p-CA. Data are represented as means ± SD (n ≥ 5). *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
