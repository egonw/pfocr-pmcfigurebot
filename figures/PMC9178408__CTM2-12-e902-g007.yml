caption: 'mTOR signalling pathway was activated after mitofusion (MFN)2 down‐regulation,
  which led to positive feedback in lipid accumulation and inflammation. mTOR phosphorylation
  in MFN2 knockdown (MFN2 kd) or negative control (MFN2 NC) stimulated with 6% cigarette
  smoke extract (CSE) ± 200 nM Rapamycin (Rap) was analyzed by Western blot (A), and
  the protein level (B) was calculated by Image J. mRNA level of 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGCR), fatty acid synthase (FASN), low‐density lipoprotein receptor
  (LDLR) and sterol‐regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in MFN2 kd and MFN2
  NC stimulated with 6% CSE for 24 h were analyzed by RT‐qPCR (C). Lipid droplets
  (LDs) stained by BODIPY 493/503 in MFN2 NC and MFN2 kd stimulated with 6% CSE ±
  200 nM Rap were scanned by Perkin‐Elmer Operetta high‐content screening (HCS) with
  40X or 63X water object and confocal mode (D), and the mean fluorescence intensity
  (MFI) (E) was analyzed by HCS image analysis software. *p < .05; **p < .01. * represents
  the intragroup comparison, and # represents the intergroup comparison'
