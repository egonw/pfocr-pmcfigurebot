caption: 'Cytoprotective effects of myriocin requires HIF1α(A) qPCR analysis for the
  relative expression of indicated genes in HT22 cells transfected with small hairpin
  RNA (sh-Hif1α-1, sh-Hif1α-2) or non-targeting sequence (sh-NC) after treatment with
  or without myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h.(B) Proteins of interest in HT22 cells transfected
  with sh-Hif1α-1, sh-Hif1α-2, or sh-NC were tested by Western blotting after treatment
  with or without myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h.(C) Relative levels of intracellular
  glucose, pyruvate, lactate, and citrate in HT22 cells transfected with sh-Hif1α-1
  or sh-NC after treatment with or without myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h.(D) With or
  without myriocin (0.5 μM) treatment for 36 h, mitochondria and nuclei in HT22 cells
  with indicated treatments were stained by MitoTracker (red) and DAPI (blue) before
  imaged by fluorescence microscopy, scale bar: 20 μm.(E) Treatment with or without
  myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h before incubating with or without erastin (1 μM) or glutamate
  (15 mM) for 24 h, the intracellular ROS of HT22 cells was detected by fluorescence
  microscopy after labeling with DCFH-DA probe, scale bar: 50 μm.(F) Flow cytometry
  analysis of HT22 cells with indicated treatments (E) after labeled with C11-BODIPY
  581/591. Relative fold changes of lipid peroxidation were calculated by quantifying
  oxidized probe.(G) Cell viability of HT22 cells after indicated treatments (E) was
  analyzed by CCK-8 method. For the above, error bars represent the mean ± SD (n =
  3, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).'
