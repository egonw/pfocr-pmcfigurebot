caption: MDCs from ΔdblGATA mice have reduced APC phenotype in vivo but not in vitro.
  (A-C) BM from WT and ΔdblGATA mice was treated with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days.
  To induce BMDC maturation, the cultures were treated with LPS for an additional
  3 days. Data represent the average of 2 independent experiments. (A) GATA1 expression
  by BMDCs determined by real-time PCR. (B) Flow cytometry plots showing MHC-II and
  CD11b expression among CD11b+CD11c+ BMDCs. (C) Frequency of MHC-IIhi cells among
  CD11b+CD11c+ BMDCs. (D) Flow cytometry plots showing MHC-II and CD11b expression
  among CD11b+CD11c+ MDCs were generated in vitro from CD45+CD11b+Ly6Glo/−Ly6Chi monocytes
  purified from the BM of WT and ΔdblGATA mice. Histograms overlays (right) of CD80
  and CD86 expression from MHC-IIhi and MHC-IIlo cells (left) are depicted. (E) Proliferation
  of cocultures of LPS-matured MDCs from panel D with DO11.10 CD4+ T cells that were
  stimulated with OVA323–339 for 72 hours. Proliferation was measured by [3H]adenine
  incorporation assay. Error bars are SEM and significance was calculated by unpaired
  Student t test. (F) WT and ΔdblGATA mice were immunized for EAE induction and sacrificed
  on day 16 after immunization (n = 14-15 per group). CNS mononuclear cells were isolated
  by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and cells from 4 to 5 mice were pooled.
  Monocytes were then highly enriched with CD11b magnetic beads followed by fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting for CD11b+Ly6ChiLy6Glo/− cells. RNA was isolated, and the transcriptomes
  of WT and ΔdblGATA monocytes were sequenced (bulk RNA sequencing; n = 3 per group).
  Differentially expressed genes with adjusted P < .05 were used for pathway analysis
  using DAVID bioinformatics database. The top 5 significantly enriched pathways using
  gene ontology and KEGG databases are shown. (G) Heatmap showing differentially expressed
  genes from the top gene ontology term from panel F. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; Norm., normal.
