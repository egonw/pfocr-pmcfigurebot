figure_title: HSV-1 infection of MIRAS patient and control fibroblasts
caption: '(a-c) Immune signalling pathway protein and viral protein amount in fibroblasts
  during HSV-1 infection. Western blot (top) and quantification (bottom) at a: 6 h,
  b: 24 h, and c: 48 h of HSV-1 infection, loading control HSP60; arrowhead: band
  of interest. N = 6 female controls and patients per condition. Quantification also
  in Fig. . (d) Comparative fold expression of HSV-1 ICP-27 and host cellular pro-inflammatory
  protein, NF-κB-p65 in the parallelly infected MIRAS patient and control fibroblasts
  at the indicated infection time from panels a-c above; two-tailed unpaired student’s
  t test. (e) POLG1 protein level and necroptosis sensitivity of fibroblasts during
  TBEV infection. Western blot of POLG1 and necroptotic activating p-MLKL protein,
  loading control HSP60; arrowhead: band of interest. N = 6 female controls and patients
  per condition. Quantification in Fig. . (f) Fibroblast cell viability at 48 h of
  HSV-1 infection. N = 6 female controls and patients per condition; In a, b, c and
  f, box plots show minimum-25th-50th(median)-75th percentile-maximum (whiskers extend
  to the smallest and largest value); two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test. Abbreviations:
