caption: IPA biological pathway analysis for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).
  The signaling pathways where proteins with differential SCI + HBOT vs SCI changes
  as well as with highest correlations to their pathways are shown. The indicated
  P value was calculated based on their correlation to the particular signaling pathway.
  The ratio indicates the percentage of the number of differential protein as compared
  to the total number of proteins in that group.
