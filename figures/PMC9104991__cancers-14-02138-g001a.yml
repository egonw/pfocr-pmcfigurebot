caption: Representative molecular and genetic interrelation between triple-negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and CAL-51) and luminal cell lines (ZR-75-1
  and MCF7). (a) Enriched signaling pathways, (b) transcriptional regulation of upstream
  pathway, (c) cytokines and chemokine, and (d) genes significantly correlated with
  forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) in TNBC cell lines compared with the luminal cell lines.
  Each log2 fold change value was ranked. The score was calculated based on hypergeometric
  distribution between the searched molecular network and the canonical pathway. *
  indicates significant pathway in TNBC compared to luminal subtype.
