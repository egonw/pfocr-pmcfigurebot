caption: Glutamine enhances N glycosylation. A Lectin blot analysis showed the change
  in lectins in pancreatic cancer cells with the addition of 2 mM glutamine to the
  culture medium. Lectins, including DSL, PHA-E, AAL, and PHA-L, were upregulated
  in cells cultured in 2 mM glutamine-containing media compared with cells cultured
  in glutamine-free media. DSL, GlcNAc/LacNAc; PHA-E, Galβ4GlcNAcβ2; WGA, Neu5Ac,
  GlcNAc; AAL, fucose; GNL, mannose; PHA-L, Galβ4GlcNAcβ6. B Fractional isotopomer
  labelling of UDP-GalNAc from [U-15N]-L-glutamine (B) after 12 h and 24 h using UHPLC-MS.
  M + (M0, M1 to Mn) represents the number of C or N in metabolites labeled by isotopes.
  The fractional abundance of mass isotopomers defined by M0, M1, and Mn was calculated.
  Three replicates per condition. UHPLC-MS, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography
  coupled with tandem Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. C–E, Volcano plot (C),
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway (D), and protein‒protein
  interaction (PPI) (E) analyses showed N-glycosylation alterations by comparing high
  glutamine pancreatic cancers (3 samples) with low glutamine pancreatic cancers (3
  samples) examined by label-free quantitative glycosylation proteomics using UHPLC‒MS/MS.
