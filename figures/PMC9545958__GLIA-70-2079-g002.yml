caption: TRAP1/Smad signal pathway is activated in EAE mice. (a) The transcriptional
  level of TGF‐β, TRAP1, and TGFβRII mRNAs in spinal cords of EAE mice was tested
  by real‐time PCR assay. (b) The protein level of TRAP1, TGFβRII, Smad4, p‐Smad2/3,
  and GFAP in spinal cords was measured by Western blot assay. The relative level
  TRAP1, TGFβRII, Smad4, and GFAP was determined by quantitative densitometry compared
  to GAPDH; the relative level of phosphorylation Smad2/3 (p‐Smad2/3) was determined
  by quantitative densitometry after normalized to corresponding non‐phosphorylation
  ones. The relative value of proteins in the NC group was considered to be 1 for
  comparison. (c) IFA was used to test the expression of GFAP (red), TRAP1 (green),
  and nuclear staining of DAPI (blue) in astrocytes from spinal cords of EAE mice.
  Scale bars, 20 μm. (d) The mRNA levels of TNF‐α, CXCL10, and MCP‐1 in spinal cords
  were determined by real‐time PCR assay. (e) The secretion levels of TNF‐α, CXCL10,
  and MCP‐1 in the sera of mice were detected by ELISA. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SEM. *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001 versus NC group (n = 10 mice/group)
