caption: Pearson correlation analysis of FXYD2 expression and biological functions
  in the TCGA cohort. (a) FXYD2 expression negatively correlated with the biological
  functions of GO analysis in the TCGA cohort. (b) FXYD2 expression negatively correlated
  with the signaling pathways of KEGG analysis in the TCGA cohort. (c) Downregulated
  FXYD2 probably interfered with TGF-Î²-PI3K-Akt-mTOR/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway in
  ccRCC.
