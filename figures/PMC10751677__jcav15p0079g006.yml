caption: Activation of Hsp70-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by silibinin.
  (A) Bladder cancer cells T24 were transfected with Hsp70-overexpressing plasmid
  before treatment with DMSO or silibinin (200 µM) for 24 hours, and subjected to
  mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) assay, the ΔΨm were analyzed by flow cytometry.
  *P<0.05 vs the indicated group. Results are shown as the mean ± standard deviation
  of three experimental repeats. (B) Hsp70-overexpressing T24 cells were incubated
  with or without 200 µM silibinin. The expression of Cyto C in cytosol and mitochondria
  was analyzed using western blotting. (C) The expression of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved
  caspase-3 and PARP/cleaved PARP were detected by western blotting. (D) T24 cells
  was treated with different concentrations of silibinin (0, 50, 100, 200 µM) for
  24 hours or 48 hours, and the expression of Apaf-1 was detected by western blotting.
  (E) Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Apaf-1, Hsp70 and pro caspase-9 were assayed
  in T24 cells following treatment with 200 µM silibinin.
