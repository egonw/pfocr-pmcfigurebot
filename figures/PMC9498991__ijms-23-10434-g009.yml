caption: Schematic view of the molecular, cytogenetic, cellular, and clinical consequences
  of exposure to IR and the validity domain of the major radiosensitivity endpoints.
  IR induces two types of DSB. The α-type DSBs are recognized by the NHEJ DSB repair
  pathway while the β-type DSBs are not []. For each type of DSB, there are some subsets
  of unrepaired DSB []. Among them, some may be unrepairable and contribute to the
  lethal effect. Some unrepaired DSBs may also provide micronuclei according to the
  radiosensitivity status and the capacity of irradiated cells to bypass the G2/M
  arrest []. The pATM foci biomarker detects the DSBs recognized by NHEJ, and the
  DSBs non-recognized by NHEJ or recognized by another DSB repair pathway can be deduced
  from the induction rate of DSBs “physically” induced by IR. The γH2AX foci biomarker
  detects the α-type DSBs only. Both α- and β-type unrepaired DSBs may provide some
  micronuclei, but the ratio between unrepaired DSBs and micronuclei is not necessarily
  equal to 1. Some subsets of micronuclei can contribute to the lethal effect. SF2
  reflects all the RI cell deaths and therefore reflects the whole cellular response
  to IR independently of the DSB repair pathways involved. The dashed line indicates
  that the link is different from a one-to-one correlation.
