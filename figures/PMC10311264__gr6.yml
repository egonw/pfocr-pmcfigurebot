caption: 'Phosphorylated STAT1 in nucleus and cytoplasm. A Western blot analysis of
  phosphorylated STAT1 in nucleus and cytoplasm fraction. HeLa cells were performed
  for nuclear and cytoplasmic separation after human IFN-γ treatment for 1 ​h. Samples
  were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody against STAT1-Y701 (top panel),
  antibodies against HSP90 and PARP were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear protein marker
  respectively. 3Cpro expression of FMDV was detected using antibody against HA (panel
  4), with antibody against β-actin as a loading control (bottom panel). B Densitometric
  analysis of the band of phosphorylated STAT1 in nucleus and cytoplasm. Intensities
  of the band were shown as the relative percentage of the total density of their
  counterpart, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions normalized with HSP90 and PARP respectively.
  Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars) of three experiments.
  -: without IFN-γ treatment, +: with IFN-γ treatment. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.'
