caption: 'Possible pathway involved in protective effects of RRE against glucocorticoid-induced
  stress. Chronic stress is known to disturb the BDNF pathway, leading to a decreased
  synaptic plasticity and neurite outgrowth. Data obtained in the present study confirms
  the effects of dexamethasone (Dexa-)-induced stress on neuronal cells (see red arrows
  on the scheme). RRE seems to counteract the effects of Dexa by increasing BDNF level
  and TrkB-dependent signaling pathway leading to an increase in cell survival and
  neuroplasticity (see green arrows on the scheme). In parallel, RRE normalizes bioenergetic
  impairments induced by Dexa, by increasing ATP levels and decreasing mitochondrial
  ROS production. Of note, as BDNF was also shown to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetic
  activity, RRE may also act indirectly on mitochondria by increasing BDNF levels.
