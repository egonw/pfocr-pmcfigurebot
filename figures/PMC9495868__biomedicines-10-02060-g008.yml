caption: 'Study the effect of miR-30d-5p mimic and AZD8835 to the tamoxifen sensitivity
  of the PEO1 cell cultures. The proliferation rate (A) and the expression of GREB1
  (B) and CA12 (C) genes were tested in E2 (10 nM)-treated PEO1 cultures that were
  supplemented with tamoxifen (Tam; 1 µM) and/or miR-30d-5p mimic (50 nM) and AZD8835
  (100 nM). Cell proliferation and gene expression were determined 24 and 48 h after
  the treatments relative to the cells that were treated with E2 only. Cell proliferation
  data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Gene induction is presented as log2FC values.
  a: p < 0.05; b: p < 0.01; c: p < 0.001; d: p < 0.0001.'
