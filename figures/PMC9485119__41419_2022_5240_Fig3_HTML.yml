figure_title: Effect of sEVs WEE2-AS1 on CRC cellular phenotype
caption: A Level of WEE2-AS1 in four paired NF-sEVs and CAF-sEVs, as determined by
  qRT-PCR. B Level of WEE2-AS1 in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells are co-cultures with PBS,
  NF-sEVs, CAF-sEVs, and CAF-sEVs +GW4869, as determined by qRT-PCR. C, D Assessment
  of the viability of HCT 116 and HT-29 cells co-cultured with sEVs by colony formation
  assays. E, F CCK8 assays are used to determine the proliferation of CRC cells co-cultured
  with sEVs. G, H Flow cytometry showing significant decreases or increases in the
  proportion of cells in S or G1-phase, respectively, when HCT 116 cells co-cultured
  with CAF-sEVsKD or CAF-sEVsOE. I, J Cells were treated with cisplatin (5ug/ml for
  24 h). Flow cytometry is used to detect the apoptotic rates (LR + UR) of cells.
  LR, early apoptotic cells; UR, terminal apoptotic cells. Data are shown as mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
