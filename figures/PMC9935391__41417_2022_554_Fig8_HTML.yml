figure_title: LINC02820 interacts directly with SF3B3 in ESCC
caption: A The integrity of RNA probes was detected by formaldehyde denaturing gel
  electrophoresis. B, C Eluates were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify immunoprecipitated proteins. D Analysis of SF3B3
  in K180 cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). E The
  binding between LINC02820 and SF3B3 was confirmed by western blot. F The result
  of RNA immunoprecipitation. G The correlation analysis between LINC02820 and SF3B3
  or SF3B3 and p65(RELA). H Proposed model for LINC02820 in ESCC. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001.
