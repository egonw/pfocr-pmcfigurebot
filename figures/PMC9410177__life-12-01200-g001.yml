caption: A simplified lignan biosynthesis pathway in sesame showing the route of synthesis
  of (+)- sesamin, (+)- sesamolin, and (+)- sesaminol. CYP81Q1 and CYP92B14 triggered
  the biosynthesis of (+)- sesamin, (+)- sesamolin and (+)- sesaminol, while UTG71A9,
  UGT94D1, UGT94AA2, and UGT94AG1 are suggested to catalyze the synthesis of (+)-
  sesaminol monoglucoside, (+)-sesaminol 2-O-β-D-glucosyl (1 2)-O-β-D-glucoside, (+)-sesaminol
  2-O-β-D-glucosyl (1 6)-O-β-D-glucoside, and (+)-sesaminol triglucoside. The target
  step in the present study is marked by a yellow rectangle. The pathway is adapted
  from Ono et al. [].
