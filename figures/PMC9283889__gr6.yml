caption: Re-clustering based on the fraction of cancer-associated fibroblasts and
  their subtype analysis(A and B) An unsupervised clustering of the CAF fraction plotted
  on the UMAP, which was color-coded according to dataset (A) and tissue type (B).(C–E)
  UMAP plots showing the stromal scores defined in C, the expression of marker genes
  for CAF subtypes (D), and the subtype score for inflammatory/myofibroblast CAFs
  (E).(F) Pearson’s correlation analysis of two CAF scores indicating a negative correlation.(G)
  Circle plots displaying putative ligand–receptor interactions, with the width of
  edges representing the strength of the communication.(H) Heatmap showing the summary
  of signaling pathways that contributed to outgoing or incoming communication. The
  color bar represents the relative signaling strength of a signaling pathway across
  cell types. The bars show the sum of signaling strength for each cell type or pathway.(I)
  Sanky diagram summarizing the interaction between iCAF/myCAF-upregulated ligands
  and the receptor of malignant clusters. The width of the edges represents the weight
  value defined in NicheNet, and the color of the output of the edge represents the
  target malignant cluster. Bubble plot showing the expression levels in myCAFs or
  iCAFs. The size of each bubble represents the rate of cells expressing a gene, and
  the color represents the scaled average expression in their cell-type cluster.
