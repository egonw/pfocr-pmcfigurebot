caption: 'Activation of the TGF-b pathways and modulation of extracellular matrix
  remodeling factors characterize cardiomyo-pathy of b-thalassemic mice. (A) Heart
  immunoprecipitation using specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (IP: pY), revealed
  with specific anti-TGF Receptor (Rec) antibody of 12-month-old WT and Hbbth3/+ mice
  (n=4 for each group). GAPDH in whole-cell lysate (WCL) is used as loading control.
  One representative gel of 3 others with similar results is presented. Densitometric
  analysis of immunoblots is shown in Online Supplementary Figure S10G. (B) Immunoblot
  analysis, using specific antibodies against PDGF-B, phosphorylated (p-)PDGFR-B,
  PDGFR-B, p-FGFR1 and FGFR in the heart of 12-month-old WT and Hbbth3/+ mice (n=4
  for each group). GAPDH serves as protein loading control. One representative gel
  of 3 with similar results is shown. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots is shown
  in Online Supplementary Figure S10H. (C) Representative images of Picrosirius staining
  for collagen on heart sections of WT and Hbbth3/+ mice (scale bars: 200 mm) and
  relative quantification expressed as percentage positive tissue area (n=3 for each
  group). (D) Schematic diagram of the dual role of Nrf2 in the development of agedependent
  cardiomyopathy in the presence of iron overload diet. Nrf2 being a redox-related
  transcriptional factor it protects against age-dependent oxidation. The absence
  of Nrf2 (Nrf2-/- mice) results in an age-dependent cardiomyopathy, associated with
  severe oxidation (ROS: reactive oxygen species) and iron accumulation combined with
  increased non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI). These events favor (i) degradation
  of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase cardiac isoform 2 (SERCA2a), a calcium
  transport system important for myocardial performance; (ii) accumulation of polyubiquinated
  proteins and (iii) activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b pathways, promoting
  collagen deposition and cardiac fibrosis. In mice exposed to iron (Fe) overload
  diet, the absence of Nrf2 is paradoxically protective. Indeed, the sustained endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress promotes overactivation of unfolded protein response (UPR)
  system. This results in upregulation of heart hepcidin, turning iron to accumulate
  in liver where the abnormality of Bmp2-6 pathway results in local impairment of
  Hamp synthesis.'
