caption: Schematic representation of PPARα signaling pathway in the hippocampus following
  agonist administration. (A) PPARα activation, upon dimerization with the retinoid
  receptor (RXR), induces transcriptional regulation of cyclic AMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), which promotes the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) signaling pathway, resulting in antidepressant-like effects and improving
  learning and memory. (B) PPARα activation can also induce allopregnanolone (Allo)
  biosynthesis by upregulating neurosteroidogenic enzymes and proteins, including
  the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). The interaction of StAR with
  cholesterol and translocator protein (TSPO) leads to cholesterol entry into the
  mitochondria and its conversion into pregnenolone (PE). In hippocampal glutamatergic
  pyramidal neurons, PE is transformed into progesterone (Prog) and then Allo, which,
  by interacting with GABAA receptors, modulates emotional behavior.
