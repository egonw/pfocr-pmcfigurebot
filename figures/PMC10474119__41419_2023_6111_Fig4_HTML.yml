figure_title: Activation of TGR5 maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibits
  cGAS-STING-mediated inflammatory response
caption: 'Müller cells were treated with HG in the presence or absence of INT-777.
  A Representative confocal images showing mPTP opening. Scale bars = 25 μm. B qRT-PCR
  assay showing mRNA levels of MTND1 and MTND-2 (n = 3). C Representative immunofluorescence
  images showing co-localization of dsDNA (green) and Tom20 (red). Blue=DAPI; yellow=merge.
  Scale bars = 25 μm. D ELISA assay showing the level of 2’3’-cGAMP in Müller cells
  (n = 3). E Representative immunofluorescence images showing co-localization of dsDNA
  (green) and cGAS (red). Blue=DAPI; yellow=merge. Scale bars = 25 μm. F Representative
  western blot showing cGAS, p-STING, and STING levels in Müller cells (n = 3). G
  Representative western blot showing p-TBK1, TBK1, p-IRF3, IRF3, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB
  levels in Müller cells (n = 3). H Representative western blot showing IL-6, TNF-α,
  and IFN-β levels (n = 3). I Representative western blot showing p-TBK1, TBK1, p-IRF3,
  IRF3, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB levels in Müller cells with or without SR717 (n = 3). Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05 versus CON group, #p < 0.05 versus HG group.'
