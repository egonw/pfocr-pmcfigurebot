caption: 'RRP9 overexpression activates the AKT signaling pathway in PC cells. A AKT
  activity was measured in RRP9-overexpressing or RRP9-silenced cells with a luciferase
  reporter assay. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 3. B Western blot analysis
  of AKT and apoptotic markers, BAD and caspase-9, protein expression in RRP9-overexpressing
  or RRP9-silenced cells. GAPDH acted as the loading control. C Colony formation was
  measured in control and RRP9-overexpressing cells treated with gemcitabine or gemcitabine
  plus AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). Representative colony formation images (left) and
  quantification (right) are shown. Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. D FACS
  analysis (upper panel) and quantification (lower panel) of control and RRP9-overexpressing
  cells treated with gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus AKT inhibitor. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD, n = 3. Note: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01'
