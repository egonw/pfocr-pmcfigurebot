caption: 'PA and TGF‐β cooperatively induce the production of exosomes containing
  let‐7b‐5p by hepatocytes. (A) Left: Electron microscopy analysis of exosomes released
  by AML‐12 cells (scale bar represents 100 nm); middle: size distribution profile
  of exosomes as determined by NTA; right: western blot analysis of CD9, CD63, CD81,
  and calnexin in AML‐12 cells and exosomes. (B) Exosomes internalized by 3T3‐L1 cells
  (green denotes exosomes and red indicates cells; green bar indicates 5 μm). (C)
  Heat map showing some significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes
  from LO2 cells treated with PA plus TGF‐β compared with control exosomes, and some
  predicted target genes of hsa‐let‐7b‐5p. (D) Let‐7b‐5p levels in exosomes derived
  from AML‐12 cells after challenged with PA and TGF‐β for 24 hours, and let‐7b‐5p
  expression in the liver, iWAT, eWAT, and serum exosomes in a mouse model of obesity.
  (E) Adrb3 levels in MEF‐like adipocyte cells after let‐7b‐5p mimic and inhibitor
  exposure and in iWAT and eWAT of Tgfbr2flox/flox and Tgfbr2ΔHEP mice. (F) Binding
  sites between let‐7b‐5p and Adrb3 mRNA 3′UTR in WT and MUT plasmids. (G) Luciferase
  activity after 293T cells co‐transfected with dual‐luciferase reporter vector along
  with let‐7b‐5p mimics or mimics NC. One‐way ANOVA and Two‐way ANOVA were used for
  statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01).
  The in vivo experiment examined Tgfbr2ΔHEP‐NCD versus Tgfbr2flox/flox‐NCD and Tgfbr2ΔHEP‐HFD
  versus Tgfbr2flox/flox‐HFD; the in vitro experiment, in which PA+TGF‐β represents
  the group treated with PA and TGF‐β, examined the control versus TGF‐β and the control
  versus PA+TGF‐β, and PA/TGF‐β versus PA+TGF‐β. Abbreviations: MUT, mutant; NC, negative
