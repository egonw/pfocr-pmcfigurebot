caption: mTOR inhibition via rapamycin at the time of injury induced early differential
  gene expression and canonical pathway activity in B+I mice compared to vehicle controls.
  Mice were administered either rapamycin or vehicle pretreatment for 7 days before
  receiving B+I injury (n = 6 per group). mRNA was extracted from (A) whole lung and
  (B) spleen tissue and run on NanoString. Differential gene expression and pathway
  Z-scores were analyzed via nSolver and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively.
  Volcano plots are of rapamycin-induced differential lung gene expression after B+I
  + rapamycin (“RAPA”) vs. B+I + vehicle controls, where red dots signify p < 0.05
  (–log10(p-value) > 1.301). For the Z-plots, only significantly altered (p < 0.5)
  pathways are shown.
