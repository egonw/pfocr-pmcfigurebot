caption: Expression levels of key genes of defence‐related hormones in Lee74 plants
  in response to SMV‐G7H expressing ATPsyn‐α and PSaC genes. Relative expression levels
  in Lee74 plants of salicylic acid‐related genes ICS1 (a) and PAD4 (b); jasmonic
  acid‐related genes JAR1 (c) and Lox2 (d), abscisic acid biosynthesis genes ABA1
  (e) and ABA2 (f), and ethylene‐related genes Gm DREB1A‐1 (g) and Gm DREB1A‐2 (h).
  The unifoliate leaves of Lee74 plants were inoculated with pSMV‐G7H::eGFP expressing
  ATPsyn‐α or PSaC genes (pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::ATPsyn‐α or pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::PSaC, respectively);
  the inoculated leaves (IL) and systemically infected leaves (SL) were collected
  at 7 and 14 days postinoculation, respectively. Actin11 was used as the internal
  control. Values are means + SD of three biological replicates. Statistical analysis
  was carried out as described in Figure ; * and ** indicate a significant difference
  at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. An additional t test was carried out to
  compare expressions in the pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::ATPsyn‐α and pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::PSaC treatments
  to that in pSMV‐G7H::eGFP
