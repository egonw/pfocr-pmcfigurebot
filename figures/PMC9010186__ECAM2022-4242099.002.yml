caption: 'ISSP attenuated oxidative damage and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  in HFD-OVX-treated ApoE−/− mice. (a) The level of ox-LDL. (b) The level of LDH.
  (c) The level of ET-1. (d) The level of SOD and MDA. (e) The western blot examined
  protein levels. (f) The mRNA expression level of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 mRNA. The
  data are denoted as mean ± SD (a-d, n = 6; e and f n = 3). ∗P < 0.05indicates a
  significant difference compared with the sham group; on the other hand, compared
  with the Mod group, #P < 0.05indicates that there is a statistically significant
  difference.'
