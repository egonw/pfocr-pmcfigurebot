caption: Flow chart of the study design. We identified the prognosis related homologous
  recombination (HR) gene mutations in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-treated
  (Samstein et al) and non-ICIs-treated cohort (TCGA and MSKCC). Based on RNA-seq
  data from TCGA cohort, we investigated the influence of prognosis related HR genes
  mutations on anti-tumor immunity, tumor microenvironment, pathway enrichment and
  therapeutic response.
