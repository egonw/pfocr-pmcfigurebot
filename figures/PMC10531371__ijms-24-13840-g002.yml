caption: Effects of HFD on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. (A–D)
  Expression of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway-related proteins (n = 3 for each
  group). (E,F) Serum IL-6 and IFN-β levels (n = 7 for ND, n = 7 for HFD). All data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001 vs. Group ND.
