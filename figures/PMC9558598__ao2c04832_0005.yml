caption: Intercellular uptake and cytotoxic effect of RR-AuNPs. (A) DIC and TIRS microscopic
  images of the cellular uptake of RR-AuNPs in HaCaT cells. (B) Cytotoxic effect of
  RR-AuNPs against HaCaT cells obtained by MTT method. (C) Fluorescence images and
  their (D) quantified results of HaCaT cells treated with RR-AuNPs and RRE, following
  staining with live/dead cell staining dye. NC, negative control treated with medium
  alone; PC, positive control treated with dexamethasone (20 μg/mL). Arrows indicate
  the RR-AuNPs accumulated inside HaCaT cells after treatment. Asterisks indicate
  significant differences between NC and each group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001.
