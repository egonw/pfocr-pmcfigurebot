caption: RIP140 deficiency increases G6PD activity. (A) The expression of G6PD and
  actin were assessed by Western blot analysis in WT or RIP140 knock-out (RIPKO) MEFs
  (left panel). Quantification was performed using Image J software on three independent
  experiments. Values were normalized to the actin signal and to WT samples (right
  panel). (B) The enzymatic activity of G6PD was quantified in WT or RIPKO MEFs using
  the G6PD assay kit (Sigma). Values are normalized to cell number and to WT samples.
  (C) The NADPH/NADP+ ratio was quantified in WT or RIPKO MEFs using the Promega NADP/NADPH-Glo
  Assay. Data were normalized to protein concentration and to WT samples. All experiments
  were conducted at least three times. Values are means Â± SEM; ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001.
