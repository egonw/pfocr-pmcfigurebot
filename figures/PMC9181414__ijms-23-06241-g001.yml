caption: The Notch signaling pathway. To the left, a schematic representation of the
  routing of the Notch receptor in the signal-receiving cell is depicted. The Notch
  receptor is produced in the ER and undergoes S1-cleavage in the Golgi compartment.
  Following interaction with Notch ligand (Jagged or Dll ligand) presented on the
  neighboring, signal-sending cell, the Notch receptor undergoes S2-cleavage. S3-cleavage
  is then executed at the plasma membrane or in endosomes, and the Notch ICD is released
  and transported to the cell nucleus. In the cell nucleus, Notch ICD forms a ternary
  complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL and MAML, and the ternary complex regulates
  expression of specific genes, such as Hes or Hey. To the right, the various processing
  steps of the Notch receptor are described. S1-cleavage generates a Notch extracellular
  domain (Notch ECD), which is shedded, and a transmembrane and intracellular domain
  (TMIC) moiety. TMIC then undergoes S2-cleavage to generate the shorter Notch extracellular
  truncation (NEXT) moiety, which still spans the membrane. NEXT is finally cleaved
  by the γ-secretase complex (S3-cleavage), generating Notch ICD, which translocates
  to the nucleus.
