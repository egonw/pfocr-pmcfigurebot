caption: An overview of canonical and non-canonical pathways in miRNA biogenesis.
  In the canonical pathway, RNA Pol II transcribes the miRNA gene, and the microprocessor
  complex (Drosha and DGCR8) processes it to form a pre-miRNA. The non-canonical route
  is Drosha/DGCR8-independent and produces pre-miRNA directly from the entire intron.
  Both pathways converge as pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by EXP 5 and Ran-GTP.
  In the cytoplasm, Dicer processes pre-miRNA into a smaller double-stranded miRNA,
  which undergoes further cleavage to create a miRNA duplex. The duplex binds to Ago
  to form the RISC. The Ago-bound miRNA duplex unwinds, selecting either the 5p or
  3p strand for the mature RISC complex. Ago, argonaute1; DGCR8, DiGeorge Critical
  Region 8; Dicer, an endoribonuclease enzyme that in humans is encoded by the DICER1
  gene; Drosha, double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease; EXP 5, Exportin-5;
  miRNA, microRNA; Ran, RAS-related nuclear protein; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex;
  RNA Pol II, RNA polymerase II; TRBP, transactivation response element RNA-binding
  protein.
