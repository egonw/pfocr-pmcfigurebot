figure_title: Mediation Analyses of Midlife Plasma Biomarkers of Neuropathology and
  Changes on the Midlife NAFLD Late-Life Brain MRI Associations
caption: Solid lines indicate significant pathway, whereas dashed lines represent
  nonsignificant pathways. (A) The framework for the mediation analysis. With mediating
  influences, path 1 and 2 are present, and path 3 attenuates when additionally adjusting
  for the potential mediator. Path 4 indicates indirect association through mediator.
  A significant path 4 is indicative of a mediation effect. (B) Mediating role of
  annual change rate of NfL in NAFLD-WMH association. (C) Mediating role of midlife
  Aβ42:40 in NAFLD temporal-parietal lobe cortical thickness meta ROI association.
  (D) Mediating role of annual change rate of NfL in NAFLD temporal-parietal lobe
  cortical thickness meta ROI association. Aβ = β-amyloid; NAFLD = nonalcoholic fatty
  liver disease; NfL = neurofilament light; ROI = region of interest; WMH = white
  matter hyperintensity.
