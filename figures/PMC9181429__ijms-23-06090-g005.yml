caption: Effects of Neu3 overexpression in H9c2 cells exposed to IRI. (A) Cell growth
  analysis. Data are expressed as relative quantity (%) as compared to both SCR or
  OX-Neu3 cells at the beginning of IRI treatment (Time 0 dashed line) (B) caspase
  3/7 activation analysis through the Caspase-GloÂ® 3/7 assay. Data are expressed as
  fold change as compared to both SCR or OX-Neu3 cells maintained in standard culture
  conditions and not exposed to IRI, used as controls (CTRL dashed line); (C) apoptotic
  nuclei staining by Hoechst 33,342; White squares represent apoptotic cells magnification;
  (D) apoptosis level analysis expressed as percentage of apoptotic nuclei per total
  nuclei. Each square in the graphs represent an experimental replicate. Statistical
  significance was determined by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test by comparing
  OX-Neu3 cells to SCR cells at any time point analyzed. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
