caption: 'PDTC influenced BPA- and BPAF-facilitated NF-κB p65, COX-2, TNF-α and EGFR
  expression in prostate cells. Effect of exposure to BPA, BPAF and the inhibitor
  of NF-κB (PDTC) on the expression of NF-κB p65 (A), COX-2 (B), TNF-α (C) and EGFR
  (D) in WPMY−1 cells and the levels of NF-κB p65 (E), COX-2 (F) and EGFR (G) in HPrF
  cells. Results are performed as means ± SD, analyzed using ANOVA followed by LSD
  post hoc test, n = 3. Comparison of the individual administration group and the
  control: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; comparison of the combined administration group
  and the individual administration group: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.'
