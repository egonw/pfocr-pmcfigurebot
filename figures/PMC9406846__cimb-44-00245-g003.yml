caption: Osteopontin signaling in cardiac fibroblasts. A number of factors induce
  osteopontin (OPN) expression in cardiac fibroblasts including angiotensin-II (Ang-II),
  syndecan-4 (Syn-4), and mechanical forces. In turn, osteopontin regulates several
  processes in cardiac fibroblasts via modulating certain signaling pathways. These
  processes include binding of osteopontin to high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to
  form focal adhesions in cardiac fibroblasts; TGFβR activation via its SVVYGLR motif
  and subsequent induction of collagen-1 and -3 (Col1/3) expression; enhancement of
  Col1/3 expression via integrin receptor-mediated signaling pathways; inhibition
  of cardiac fibroblast apoptosis via blocking the release of cytochrome C (Cyt C)
  from mitochondria; inhibition of the activity and expression of MMP-2/9 induced
  by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling pathway; induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  1 (TIMP-1) expression via integrin- and CD44-mediated signaling pathways. The overall
  effect of osteopontin signaling in cardiac fibroblasts results in myofibroblast
  differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival, synthesis of extracellular
  matrix (ECM) proteins, and modulation of ECM via regulating expression of MMPs and
  TIMPs.
