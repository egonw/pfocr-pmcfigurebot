figure_title: Carbidopa-mediated suppression of IDO1 in tumor cells inhibits mTORC1
  signaling pathway
caption: (A and B) Western blotting showing protein expression of S6K and 4EBP1 (total
  and phospho-form) in carbidopa-treated BxPC-3 and HPAF-II cell lines, which were
  also treated with MG132 to rule out protein degradation. β-actin was used as an
  endogenous control.

  expression in pancreatic cancer and decreases tumor growth.
