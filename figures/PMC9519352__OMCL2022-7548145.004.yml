caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming effects of KAN0438757 (KAN) on tumor necrosis factor-α-
  (TNF-α-) induced metabolism phenotype of nucleus pulposus primary (NPP) cells in
  vitro. (a) Normalized OCR of NPPs after negative control, TNF-α, and TNF-α with
  2.5 μM KAN treatment for 24 hours. (b) Normalized ECAR of NPPs after negative control,
  TNF-α, and TNF-α with 2.5 μM KAN treatment for 24 hours. (c) Effects of KAN on basal
  respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity in OCR assay. (d)
  Effects of KAN on glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve in ECAR
  assay. (e) Modified KAN reprogrammed the energy metabolism phenotype of TNF-α-inducted
  NPPs. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 3. ns: no significance; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p
  < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
