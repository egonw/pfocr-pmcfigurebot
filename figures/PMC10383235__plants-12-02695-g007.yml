caption: General phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and expression analysis by qRT-PCR
  of biosynthetic genes in leaves collected from ‘Ca. P. solani’-positive plants,
  expressed as fold change (FC) relative to ‘Ca. P. solani’-negative plants. Samples
  were collected in May, July, August, and September. The reported compounds detected
  by HPLC ESI/MS-TOF and key biosynthetic genes and relative enzymes are in red. PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase. Red lines highlight the 2-fold change to graphically
  identify genes upregulated in positive plants compared to negative ones. ANOVA results
  were reported based on their statistical significance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.
