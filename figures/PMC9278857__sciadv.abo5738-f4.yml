figure_title: NMR spectrum of the lignin aromatic region
caption: Partial short-range 1Hâ€“13C HSQC NMR spectra from isolated ELs from cell walls
  of the main stem of senesced Arabidopsis plants. WT (A) and SCOP (B and C) lines
  were analyzed. The colors of the contours correspond to the structures drawn. H
  peaks are indicated as trace amounts as their signals coincide with those of Phe3/5.
  In the difference spectrum (D), hot-colored contours represent positive, whereas
  cold (light cyan) contours represent negative differences after subtracting (A)
  from (B); the scopoletin peaks colored in solid magenta were also positive. A scopoletin
  standard (E) was used to identify resonance peaks related to scopoletin incorporation
  in the difference spectrum. ppm, parts per million (Hz/MHz).
article_title: Overexpression of the scopoletin biosynthetic pathway enhances lignocellulosic
  biomass processing.
