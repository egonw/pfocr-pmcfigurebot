figure_title: The liver-specific Sptlc2 transgene (lSptlc2-Tg) inhibits insulin signaling
caption: Liver-specific Sptlc2 transgenic mice were constructed, and three germ lines
  were generated. The hepatic SPT activity of the three germ lines (F03, F06, and
  F08) was measured (a). n = 3–4, mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05 vs. wild-type (WT) mice. The
  protein expression of Sptlc2 in F06 cells was analyzed by western blotting (b).
  The overexpression of hepatic Sptlc2 protein was confirmed (b), and there was no
  overexpression in other organs by immunoblotting (c). WT mice and lSptlc2 mice were
  fed either a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks and their
  livers were isolated to measure the protein expression levels of Sptlc1 and Sptlc2
  (d). The protein intermediates in the insulin signaling pathway (IR, insulin receptor;
  AKT) and gluconeogenic proteins (G6Pase, glucose 6-phosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase) were measured 10 min postinjection of insulin (1 U/kg) by western
  blotting (e).
