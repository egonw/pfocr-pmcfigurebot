caption: Classical signaling pathways activated by GPER. GPER binds to its endogenous
  ligands (estrogen and aldosterone), leading to multiple downstream cascades, including
  ERK, PI3K/AKT, AMPK/PKA, and NF-kB pathways. Activation of Src via GPER results
  in the release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mediation of heparin-binding epidermal
  growth factor (HB-EGF) cleavage, followed by transactivation of the EGF receptor
  (EGFR), which in turn causes the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  (ERK) and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and serine/threonine
  kinase (PI3K/AKT). GPER stimulates the AMPK signaling pathway, which increases adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) activity to stimulate the cAMP-activated downstream protein kinase
  A (PKA) signal pathway that inhibits ERK. GPER also reduces the phosphorylation,
  nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity of the NF-ÎºB pathway.
