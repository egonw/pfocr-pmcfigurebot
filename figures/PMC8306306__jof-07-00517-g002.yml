caption: Metabolic map of citric acid synthesis in Aspergillus luchuensis mut. kawachii.
  Glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, trehalose synthesis pathway, glycerol synthesis
  pathway, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are depicted []. Different colored arrows
  and metabolites indicate upregulated, downregulated, or not significantly changed
  gene expression and metabolite levels as a consequence of lowering the temperature
  during koji making [].
