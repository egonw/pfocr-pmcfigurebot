caption: The full-length GH receptor (flGHR) vs. deletion of exon 3 GH receptor (d3GHR)
  signaling pathways. The sensitivity of the intracellular JAK-STAT pathway to growth
  hormone is increased in the absence of exon 3, which raises the transcription of
  GH target genes in comparison to that of the flGHR isoform (created using https://www.biorender.com)
