figure_title: Nitrogen nutrition and signaling during root nodule symbiosis impact
  the community assemblies
caption: Lotus plants grown in the presence of inorganic nitrogen secrete specific
  metabolites and assemble a microbial community with low connectivity. Lotus plants
  grown in symbiosis-permissive conditions secrete metabolites such as flavonoids
  (1) that induce Nod factor production in compatible nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium isolates
  (2). Nod factors are recognized by the Lotus host which initiates a signaling pathway
  (3) to accommodate the symbiont. Symbiotically active roots have an exudate profile
  (4) and associated microbial communities that differ from plants grown in the presence
  of inorganic nitrogen. It remains to be determined how bacterial communities associated
  with symbiotically active plants impact the host to promote the symbiotic association
  and plant growth (5).
