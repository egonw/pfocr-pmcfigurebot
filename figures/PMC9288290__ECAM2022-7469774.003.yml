caption: 'Silencing of miR-373-3p weakened the antitumor effects of ASP in U251 cells.
  (a) miR-373-3p expression was detected by RT-qPCR; (b) cell viability was measured
  by CCK-8 assay; (c) cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry; (d) cell migration
  was measured by wound healing assay; (e) cell invasion was measured by transwell
  assay. U251 cells were transfected with the miR-373-3p inhibitor/inhibitor NC and
  then treated with 0.4 mg/mL ASP. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. Control; ##P < 0.01,
  ###P < 0.001 vs. ASP; &P < 0.05, &&&P < 0.001 vs. ASP + inhibitor NC.'
