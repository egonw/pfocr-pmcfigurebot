caption: MEK inhibition activates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. (A) Cell sensitivity
  to the MEK inhibitor trametinib and selumetinib. KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells were treated
  with trametinib (Tram) or selumetinib (Selu) at gradient concentrations for 72 h,
  and cell viability was measured. IC50 values are represented as mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments with three technical replicates each. Resistant cell lines
  are marked in green, and sensitive cell lines are marked in brown. (B) Metabolite
  set enrichment analysis. H460 and A549 cells were treated with trametinib at their
  respective 1/2 IC50 values for 24 h and then harvested for metabolomic profiling
  determination. Metabolite set enrichment analysis was performed to identify dysregulated
  metabolic pathways. The corresponding enrichment pathways (n = 6) are shown. (C)
  Abundance of major metabolites in the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways. H460 and A549 cells were exposed to trametinib
  at their respective 1/2 IC50 values for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to LC/MS
  analysis. Heatmap showed change of metabolites in the glycolysis and the TCA-OXPHOS
  pathway in trametinib-treated cells versus untreated cells. Metabolite abundance
  was normalized by cell number. NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAD+, oxidized
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Values are scaled as indicated (2 to −2; n = 6).
