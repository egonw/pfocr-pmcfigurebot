caption: 'Schematic overview of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Protein encoding genes
  identified with differential expression (q < 0.05, fold change ≥ |1.3|) in either
  (A) Ren(1a–9) or (B) Ren(2–9) overexpressing H9c2 cells as compared with pIRES controls
  are highlighted. The red color indicates genes with increased mRNA levels and the
  blue color indicates those with decreased mRNA levels as compared with pIRES controls,
  while the gray color indicates not significantly altered genes with q > 0.05 or
  fold change < |1.3|. Gene expression data and the schematic pathway were based on
  microarray analyses and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software, respectively.
