caption: Isolation and purification of Solanum nigrum L. guided by anti-CRC activity.
  (A) Effect of components E-D1~E-D4 on SW620 cell viability. The cells were treated
  with gradient concentrations of E-D1~E-D4 for 24 h and cell viability was measured
  by MTT. (B) Effect of compounds 1~7 on SW620 cell viability. (C) Chemical structure
  of SS. All experiments were performed three times independently.
