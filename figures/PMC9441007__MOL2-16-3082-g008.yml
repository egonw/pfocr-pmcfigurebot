caption: 'USP28 inhibition potentiates targeted molecular therapy. (A) Kaplan–Meier
  plot of PFS of NSCLC patients relative to USP28 mRNA expression. n = 596 samples,
  P = < 0.0005. Data were generated with the online tool www.kmplot.com. P‐values
  were calculated using the survival log‐rank statistical test. (B) Analysis of publicly
  available data sets analysing USP28 mRNA expression and overall survival (OS) in
  patients with mutations in the oncogenic driver EGFR (n = 33), RAS (n = 41), PIK3CA
  (n = 10) or BRAF (n = 17). Samples were divided into two groups based on USP28 mRNA
  expression: high USP28 (higher than the median USP28 expression) and low USP28 (lower
  than the median USP28 expression). Survival days were determined for both groups.
  Data were obtained from the online tool https://xena.ucsc.edu/. In box plots, the
  centre line reflects the median and the upper and lower box limits indicate the
  first and third quartiles. Whiskers extend 1.5× the IQR. Plot was generated using
  the online tool http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/. (C) Pearson''s correlation
  between sensitivity of EGFR‐PI3K‐MAPK inhibitors and USP28 expression in human NSCLC
  cell lines. Data were represented using Z‐Scores, and the graphic was generated
  with the online tool Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal V2 (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ctrp/.v2.1).
  In the online tool, 531 compounds were analysed (n = 531). For the graphical plot,
  the lower line reflects the median and the upper box limit indicates the first quartile.
  Whiskers extend 1.5× the IQR. (D) Schematic representation of EGFR‐PI3K‐MAPK pathway
  analysed in this study and potential pathway interference opportunities by EGFR‐PI3K‐MAPK
  and AZ1 inhibitors. Green = EGFR‐PI3K‐MAPK inhibitors. Violet = AZ1. (E) Immunoblots
  against USP28, NOTCH1, c‐MYC and c‐JUN of BEAS‐2BONC (EGFRL858R, PIK3CA L1047R and
  BRAFV600E) cultured in the presence of either control solvent (DMSO), pathway‐specific
  inhibitors (EGFR: 20 µm gefitinib; PIK3CA: 1 µm buparlisib; and BRAF: 20 µm vemurafenib),
  15 µm AZ1 or a combination thereof for 24 h. Vinculin serves as loading control.
  n = 3. (F) BLISS synergism score of BEAS‐2BONC (EGFRL858R, PIK3CA L1047R and BRAFV600E)
  cultured in the presence of either control solvent (DMSO), pathway‐specific inhibitors
  (EGFR: gefitinib; PIK3CA: buparlisib; and BRAF: vemurafenib), AZ1 and combination
  thereof for 72 h at indicated concentrations. Shown are representative DAPI images
  of cells 72 h postculture in the presence of DMSO, single treatment with 7.5 µm
  AZ1, 7.5 µm gefitinib, 0.5 µm buparlisib, 7.5 µm VEMURAFENIB or combination of AZ1
  with the respective personalized molecular therapy for 72 h. Synergism was calculated
  by cell quantification of 30–45 20× fields from three independent wells in control
  (DMSO) and the indicated treated conditions. combenefit software was used to calculate
  synergism. n = 3. Scale bar = 15 µm. (G) Immunofluorescence of Ki‐67 expression
  in oncogenic transduced BEAS‐2BONC (EGFRL858R, PIK3CA L1047R and BRAFV600E), cultured
  in the presence of DMSO, single treatment with 7.5 µm AZ1, 7.5 µm gefitinib, 0.5 µm
  buparlisib, 7.5 µm vemurafenib or combination of AZ1 with the respective pathway
  inhibitor for 72 h, to assess effects in cell proliferation. Shown are representative
  cells. Quantification of Ki‐67 expression in 30–45 20× fields from different wells
  in control (DMSO) and treated conditions. DAPI served as nuclear marker. n = 3.
  Shown are mean values and standard deviation. P‐values were calculated using the
  two‐tailed t‐test statistical analysis. Scale bar = 5 µm. (H) Immunofluorescence
  of propidium iodide (PI) in vivo incorporation of oncogenic transduced BEAS‐2BONC
  (EGFRL858R, PIK3CA L1047R and BRAFV600E), cultured in the presence of DMSO, single
  treatment with 7.5 µm AZ1, 7.5 µm gefitinib, 0.5 µm buparlisib, 7.5 µm vemurafenib
  or combination of AZ1 with the respective pathway inhibitor for 72 h, to assess
  effects in cell proliferation. Shown are representative cells. Quantification of
  PI‐positive cells in 30–45 20× fields from different wells in control (DMSO) and
  treated conditions. DAPI served as nuclear marker. Shown are mean values and standard
  deviation. P‐values were calculated using the two‐tailed t‐test statistical analysis.
