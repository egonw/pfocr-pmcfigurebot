caption: Tumor microenvironment and biological function characteristics of distinct
  SLC gene subtypes. (A–B) Heatmap (A) and boxplot (B) show the biological pathway
  activation status based on “hallmark gene sets” in the five SLC gene subtypes in
  the meta-GEO cohort. Cohort details and SLC gene subtypes are used as sample annotations
  of the heatmaps. Boxes represent 25–75 % of values, lines in boxes represent median
  values, whiskers represent 1.5 interquartile ranges, and black dots represent outliers.
  (C–D) Heatmap (C) and box plot (D) illustrate the results of tumor microenvironment
  landscape in the five SLC gene subtypes in the meta-GEO cohort. Cohort details and
  SLC gene subtypes are used as sample annotations of the heatmaps. Boxes represent
  25–75 % of values, lines in boxes represent median values, whiskers represent 1.5
  interquartile ranges, and black dots represent outliers. (E–J) Violin plots of the
  abundance of the enteroendocrine cell (E), goblet cell subtype 1 (F), goblet cell
  subtype 2 (G), OLFM4 high stem cell (H), mesenchymal cell (I), and exhausted T cells
  (J) among five SLC gene subtypes in the meta-GEO. (K) Sankey diagram of SLC gene
  subtypes in groups with different molecular subtypes in the GSE39582 cohorts.*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; ns, not significant; Ref, reference; SLC, solute carrier;
  HMC, histone modification cluster; CMS, consensus molecular subtypes; TMEC, tumor
  microenvironment cluster.
