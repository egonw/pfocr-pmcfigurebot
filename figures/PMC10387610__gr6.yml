caption: 'Inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway leads to an increase in tph2+
  neurons(A and B) HCR RNA-FISH against tph2 mRNA. Arrowheads indicate tph2-expressing
  neurons. (A) Control embryo treated with DMSO. (B) Embryo treated with the Notch
  inhibitor LY.(C) Quantification of tph2+ neurons. Embryos were treated from 2 to
  3 dpf. The dorsal side is oriented upwards, and the anterior side is oriented toward
  the left. Statistical significance was assessed using Welch’s t-test, and the level
  of significance is indicated by the number of asterisks: ∗∗ for p < 0.01. Scale
  bar: 20 μm.'
