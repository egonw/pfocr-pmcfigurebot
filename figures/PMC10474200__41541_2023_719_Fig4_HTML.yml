figure_title: Interconnectivity between prioritized high confidence transcription
  factors
caption: a Direct interactions network of five higher confidence causal transcription
  factors. b Direct interactions network of five higher confidence causal transcription
  factors in addition to prolactin (PRL). c Direct interactions network of 33 causal
  upstream regulators that are known biomarkers for menstrual disturbances. d Direct
  interactions network of 33 causal upstream regulators that are known biomarkers
  for menstrual disturbances, in addition to prioritized 5 topological genes and PRL.
  Thick edges correspond to confidence score  0.70 (i.e., high confidence score),
  while the thin edge corresponds to a confidence level  0.50 (i.e., low confidence
  score). Nodes are color-coded using a split pie chart coloring scheme indicating
  pathway/gene set contribution to each node from the top 5 most enriched pathways/gene
  lists. FDR values represent he significance of the predicted pathway. Generated
  based on STRING data on 27 September 2022.
