caption: Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of sorted renal CD4+ TH17 cells show
  intracellular IL-17 signaling pathway activation. (A) Experimental setup and sorting
  strategy of fate-mapped renal CD4+ TH17 cells from the cGN kidney. (B) Dimensional
  reduction by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and unsupervised
  clustering of renal TH17 cells. (C) IL-17A and marker gene expression in the different
  clusters of renal TH17 cells. (D) Expression of indicated genes in the UMAP space.
  (E) UMAP plot indicating which cells have activated intracellular IL-17 signaling
  (left) and comparison of IL-17high clusters (C1, C5, C6) versus IL-17low clusters
  (C0, C2, C3, C4, C7, C8). (F) Expression of genes annotated to intracellular IL-17
  signaling. ****P<0.0001. scRNA-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing; YFP, yellow fluorescent
  protein.
