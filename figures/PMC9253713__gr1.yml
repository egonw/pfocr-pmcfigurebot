caption: SUFU regulates the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to RSL3-triggered ferroptosis(A)
  Pharmaco-transcriptomic correlation analysis identified key components of the SHH
  pathway associated with sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers across solid cancer
  cell lines (n = 658). Blue dots indicate the significantly negatively correlated
  genes while red dots indicate the positively correlated ones. Here, a negative correlation
  indicates the association of a larger AUC (area under the curve) with lower gene
  expression and vice versa.(B and C) Viability (%) of breast cancer cells MCF-7 and
  T47D stably depleted of SUFU (B), or HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 stably overexpressing
  SUFU (C), following RSL3 treatment at indicated concentrations for 24 h.(D and E)
  Cell death determined by Sytox Green staining of cells in D and E, respectively,
  cells were treated with RSL3 at indicated concentrations for 24 h; scale bar, 200μm.(F
  and G) RSL3-induced ROS levels (F) and GSH/GSSG ratios (G) were measured in MCF-7
  and T47D cells in which SUFU was knocked down by siRNA (upper panels), or HCC1954
  and MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing SUFU (lower panels). ROS levels were assessed
  by flow cytometry with C11-BODIPY. GSH/GSSG ratios were measured by a GSH/GSSG-Glo
  assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Unpaired t test). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001). (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test or Unpaired t test).
