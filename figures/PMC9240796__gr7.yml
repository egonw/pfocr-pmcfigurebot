caption: Cytoprotective effects of myriocin in different cells(A) PC-12, HT1080, GES-1,
  and SK-Hep-1 cells treated with myriocin (0.5 μM) for indicated time were subjected
  to Western blotting to monitor the protein levels of HIF1α.(B) Cells treated with
  myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h were subjected to qPCR to measure the relative Hif1α
  mRNA expression. Error bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 3).(C) Ubiquitin/HIF1α
  co-immunoprecipitation in cells extracts. Cells treated with or without myriocin
  (0.5 μM) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1α antibody or IgG as negative
  control. The immunocomplexes were then immunoblotted using anti-ubiquitin or anti-HIF1α
  antibody (Output). The levels of HIF1α in cell lysates before immunoprecipitation
  were also monitored (Input).(D) Cell viability analysis of cells pre-treated with
  myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h before incubating with erastin for 24 h. Error bars represent
  the mean ± SD (n = 3, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
