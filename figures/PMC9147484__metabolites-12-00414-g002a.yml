caption: (a) Main chemical families represented in meconium and their numbers and
  percentages (number; name of the chemical family; percentage). (b) Enriched metabolic
  pathways identified through interrogation of the KEGG human metabolic pathways using
  Metaboanalyst 5.0 tools []. The enrichment ratio on the x-axis represents the number
  of metabolites assigned per metabolic pathway out of the total number of metabolites
  belonging to the pathway studied.
