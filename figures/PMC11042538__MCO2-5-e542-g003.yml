caption: Molecular features of senescent cells. Senescent cells undergo distinct chromatin
  changes including the formation of (A) γH2A.X, (B) senescence‐associated heterochromatin
  foci, and (C) the cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs). (D) Proteases such as
  MMPs, serine proteases, and controllers of plasminogen activation pathway are also
  secreted by senescent cells. (E) Senescent cells can also synthesize sEVs to remodel
  the TME. (F) Multiple upstream signals have been shown to regulate senescence features,
  and the majority of them eventually converge to activate CCAAT/enhancer‐binding
  protein β (C/EBP‐β) and nuclear factor kappa‐B (NF‐κB) signaling. HMGA, high mobility
  group protein A; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; SAHF, senescence‐associated heterochromatin
  foci; CCFs, cytoplasmic chromatin fragments; ECM, extracellular matrix; uPA, serine
  proteases urokinase; tPA, tissue‐type plasminogen activators; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; FN, fibronectin; sEVs, small extracellular vesicles.
