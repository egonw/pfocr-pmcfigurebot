caption: Schematic of the inhibitory effect of CAV VP1 on the cGAS-STING pathway.
  CAV encoded VP1 can inhibit the production of IFN-β through suppression of IRF7
  activation of the cGAS-STING pathway by hampering IRF7 dimerization, resulting in
  reduced nuclear translocation of IRF7. This leads to the inhibition of IFN-β production,
  thereby enabling the immune escape of the virus in the host cell.
