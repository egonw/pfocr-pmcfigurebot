figure_title: LZFL1 inhibits ccRCC growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model
caption: a Tumor micrograph (left panel) and weight (right panel) at time of sacrifice
  from PDXs treated with lentiviruses expressing control vector (NC) or LZTFL1. Mean ± SD,
  *, P < 0.05, unpaired t-test. b Tumor volume during treatment. Mean ± SEM, *, P < 0.05,
  two-way ANOVA. c H&E and IHC staining of PDX tumors, scale bar is 100 μm. d Schematic
  diagram of the role of LZTFL1 in ccRCC. LZTFL1 binds to ZNRF1 and AKT, promotes
  AKT degradation through the UPP pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and inhibition
  of ccRCC growth.
article_title: LZTFL1 inhibits kidney tumor cell growth by destabilizing AKT through
  ZNRF1-mediated ubiquitin proteosome pathway.
