caption: 'Different pathways of DNA single-strand breaks repair. BER pathway: base
  damage is recognized by DNA glycosylases that are monofunctional, bifunctional,
  or Nei-like. APE1 immediately incises the DNA backbone 5â€² to the abasic site to
  generate a gap, which is then filled by a DNA polymerase. The repair synthesis step
  then branches into two pathways, single-nucleotide-patch BER (SP-BER) and long-patch
  BER (LP-BER). They all consist of different enzymes. NER pathway: This repair pathway
  is divided into two branches due to different ways of sensing damage, in the GG-NER
  pathway, the damage sensor XPC probes the DNA for helix-distorting lesions, and
  RNA pol II indirectly detects the existence of damage in the other way. Next step,
  their pathway merges, and XPB and XPD verify the DNA damage. Finally, as with other
  pathways, a series of proteins perform damage cleavage and nick ligation. MMR pathway:
  Mispair is recognized by MutS homologs and then recruits MutL homologs and EXO1
  exonuclease. Lastly, the daughter strand is excised, and the replicative DNA polymerases
  fill the gap. (By Figdraw).'
