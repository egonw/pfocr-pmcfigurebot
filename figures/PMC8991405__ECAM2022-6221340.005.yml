caption: EC modulated the metabolites in serum in NAFLD rats. (a) PCA among groups.
  (b, c) OPLS-DA of untargeted metabolomics data between the control and model groups
  and the relative coefficient of loading plots. (d, e) OPLS-DA untargeted metabolomics
  data between the model and EC high-dose groups and the relative coefficient of loading
  plots. (f, g) Pathway analysis of differential metabolites between control and model
  groups (f) and between model and EC high-dose groups (g). The common pathways were
  written in red. a, arachidonic acid metabolism; b, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism;
  c, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism; d, cysteine and methionine metabolism; e, vitamin
  B6 metabolism; f, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies; g, butanoate metabolism;
  h, sulfur metabolism; i, linoleic acid metabolism.
