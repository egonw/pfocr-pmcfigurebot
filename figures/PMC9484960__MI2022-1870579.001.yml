caption: LMX1B was upregulated in OA cartilage tissue and IL-1β-induced chondrocytes.
  (a, c, and e) qRT-PCR analysis for LMX1B mRNA expression in cartilage tissue (a),
  SW1353 cells (c), and C28/I2 cells (e). (b, d, and f) Western blot analysis for
  LMX1B protein expression in cartilage tissue (b), SW1353 cells (d), and C28/I2 cells
  (f). SW1353 and C28/I2 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h. ∗P < 0.05.
  20 OA patients and 10 normal subjects were used in this study; moreover, all experiments
  were repeated three times in SW1353 and C28/I2 cells.
