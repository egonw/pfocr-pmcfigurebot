figure_title: Bromide ions behave as PAMs of the mGlu4 receptor and shows synergistic
  effects with the mGlu4 PAM VU0155041
caption: 'A Signaling cascade of mGlu4 receptor when coupled with the chimeric G-protein
  Gαqi9 (to allow the recruitment of the phosphoinositide pathway) and experimental
  principles of the calcium mobilization (B) and IP1 accumulation assays (C). B In
  the calcium mobilization assay, bromide ions behave as PAM of mGlu4, demonstrating
  broader effects than chloride ions on both pEC50 and Emax. C In the IP1 accumulation
  assay, bromide confirmed its PAM effects; when supplemented with VU0155041, facilitation
  of mGlu4 signaling was even increased, as seen by a further rise in ∆pEC50. Results
  are shown as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments realized in triplicates.
  Solid stars: effect of ion concentration on Emax; asterisks: effect of ion concentration
  on ∆pEC50, comparison with physiological conditions (100 mM Cl− + 50 mM gluconate);
  (a): comparison with high chloride condition (150 mM Cl−, p < 0.0001); hashtags:
