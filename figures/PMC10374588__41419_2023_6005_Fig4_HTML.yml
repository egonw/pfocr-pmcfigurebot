figure_title: Graphical depiction of the mechanism of classical pyroptosis pathway
  and non-classical pyroptosis pathway
caption: The classical pyroptosis pathway was activated upon recognition of exogenous
  and endogenous PAMPs or DAMPs. Two steps mediate the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  In the first step, PAMPs or DAMPs bind to TLRs and activate the MyD88/NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which results in the production of pro-IL-1β/18. The second step is centered
  on caspase-1 activation and inflammasome assembly. This step transcriptionally promotes
  the expression of the NLRP3 gene by activating NF-κB and promotes diverse post-transcriptional
  alterations of the NLRP3 protein. The NLRP3 oligomerization and ASC recruitment
  cleavage of the pro-caspase-1 resulted in caspase-1 autocatalytic activation. Importantly,
  activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to produce GSDMD-NT, which forms plasma membrane
  pores to induce IL-1β/18 secretions. In more detail, three specific mechanisms are
  involved in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Firstly, extracellular ATP binds to the
  P2X7 receptor and forms a pore in the cell membrane, resulting in K+ efflux and
  NLRP3 activation. Secondly, particulate or crystalline agonists lead to lysosomal
  rupture, resulting in the leakage of lysosomal cathepsins B and L that aid in NLRP3
  inflammasome assembly. Under the third model, mtDNA and TXNIP stimulate the generation
  of ROS, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. In the non-classical pyroptosis
  pathway, LPS generated by Gram-negative bacteria activates caspase-4/5 (mouse) or
  caspase-11 (human) and stimulates the oligomerization and activation of the inflammatory
  caspases. These active caspases can cleave GSDMD to GSDMD-NT and generate membrane
  holes, resulting in cascaded responses similar to the classical pyroptosis pathway.
