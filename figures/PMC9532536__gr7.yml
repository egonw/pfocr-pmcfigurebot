caption: 'In vivo anti-tumor effect of CuB. Mice were intragastric administrated with
  CuB (1 mg/kg), MEK162 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 weeks (n = 7). One mouse died
  in the midnight of Day 23 under 1 mg/kg CuB treatment. After 5 weeks, all the mice
  were sacrificed and the tumors were excised for analysis. (A) Tumor volume of mice
  from each group. (B) Body weight of mice from each group during the whole observation
  period. (C) The representative images of H&E staining of liver and kidney from mice
  in each group at the end of the observation period. Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Effects
  on protein expression of FOXM1–KIF20A pathway in CRMM2 tumor tissues. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group by two-way ANOVA using GraphPad
  Prism 8.0 (n = 7).'
