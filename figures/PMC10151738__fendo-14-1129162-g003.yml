caption: Sensitivity of luminal A ERα-positive invasive ductal carcinomas to GART
  inhibition. Linear regression and Spearman Correlation values between the sensitivity
  to GART siRNA-induced anti-proliferative effect as downloaded by the DepMap portal
  (https://depmap.org/portal) and the calculated inhibitor concentration 50 (IC50)
  for lometrexol (LMX)-induced anti-proliferative effect in the same BC cell lines
  stratified in luminal A (LumA, green dots) and luminal B (LumB, red dots) BC cell
  lines and in non-invasive ductal carcinomas (Not-IDC) (A) or invasive ductal carcinomas
  (IDC) (B) r and p-values are given in the main panels. The sensitivity to GART siRNA-induced
  (C) and lometrexol (LMX)-induced (D) ERα degradation effect as calculated by extrapolating
  the effective concentration 50 (EC50) and -Log2 transforming it in different BC
  cell lines stratified as luminal A (LumA, green dots) and luminal B (LumB, red dots)
  and non-invasive ductal carcinomas (Not-IDC) or invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC).
  Kaplan-Meier plots showing the relapse-free survival (RFS) probability in women
  carrying breast tumors expressing ERα, both expressing or not progesterone receptor
  (PR) but not HER2 (E) or ERα, HER2 or both expressing or not PR (F) as a function
  of GART mRNA levels. Significant differences between the RFS are given as p-value
  in each panel. Data have been downloaded by the website (https://kmplot.com/analysis/).
  All possible cutoff values between the lower and upper quartiles are automatically
  computed (i.e., auto-select best cutoff on the website), and the best performing
  threshold is used as a cutoff ().

  the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as novel targets for the treatment of luminal
  A ERα expressing primary and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma.
