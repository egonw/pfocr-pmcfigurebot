figure_title: cGAS/STING pathway-dependent cytokine expression in HeLa cells
caption: 'a Cytokines expression in HeLa cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Sc)
  or two different siRNA against STING (#1 and #2). Asterisks indicate statistical
  significance of silenced sample compared to scramble by t test. *P < 0.05. b WB
  of STING protein level in not treated B16 WT and KO for STING cell line. c Cytokines
  expression was analysed as in panel a in both WT and KO for STING B16 cell. Asterisks
  indicate statistical significance in comparison with untreated cells by t test.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. d Expression level of cytokine genes in HeLa overexpressing
  RNaseH1 cell line in response to CPT and LMP776. Data are represented as mean of
  two biological replicates ± SEM; P values are indicated on the top of each bar and
  they are calculated as one-tailed ratio paired t test.'

  reduced in human small-cell lung cancers by impairment of the cGAS/STING pathway.
