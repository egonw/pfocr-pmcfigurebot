caption: Alterations to the circadian clock in obese endometrial stroma. A Distribution
  of genes which are significantly upregulated vs. downregulated in high-fat stroma.
  B-C Enrichment analysis for GO biological processes for downregulated genes (n = 107)
  (B) or upregulated genes (n = 34) (C). D Correlation between glucose tolerance (measurement
  at 30 min) or body mass and expression of rhythmic process genes Per, Nr1d2, Gpr176,
  Hlf, Dbp, and Tef. Statistic is Pearson’s correlation. E Enrichment analysis for
  GO biological process Cell Cycle DNA Repair. Statistic is hypergeometric enrichment.
  F Heatmap of altered genes (n = 5) from Cell Cycle DNA Repair pathway. G Correlation
  between body mass and Lig1 (top) or Fgfr1 (bottom) expression or glucose tolerance
  (measurement at 30 min) and Fgfr1 expression (middle). Statistic is Pearson’s correlation
