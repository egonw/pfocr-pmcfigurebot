figure_title: Cytochrome c acts as a DAMP to activate neuroinflammation
caption: Under stress conditions, the mitochondrial membrane of neurons or glia (the
  left cell) ruptures and cytochrome c is released outside the mitochondria. Cytochrome
  c in the cytoplasm activates the apoptosis signaling pathway. Extracellular cytochrome
  c activates the MAPK-JNK signaling cascade through TLR4 on the membrane surface
  of glia (the right cell), leading to neuroinflammation.
