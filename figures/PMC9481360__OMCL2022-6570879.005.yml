caption: 'IPO5 expression in 6 patients with esophageal cancer was higher in cancer
  tissues than in adjacent tissues. (a) Esophageal cancer tissues showed high IPO5
  expression. (b) Low expression of IPO5 in normal tissues of esophageal cancer. (c)
  Increased expression of IPO5 in cancer tissues was calculated by the immunohistochemical
  score in 6 patients with esophageal cancer (note: âˆ—P < 0.05).'
