caption: 'The transport defect phenotype is caused by the downregulation of SEC23A.
  (A) Differential expression analysis of a subset of 595 manually curated secretory
  pathway genes for the indicated knockdowns (48 h) compared with control siRNA. The
  zoomed-in region highlights the COPII genes. (B) RT-qPCR quantification of SEC23A
  levels after 48 h of knockdown with the indicated siRNAs. Bars represent averages
  of three independent experiments, and dots, the individual values. The dark gray
  bar represents SEC23A levels after 48 h of MACF1 siRNA treatment in human lung fibroblasts.
  (C) Western blot analysis of SEC23A protein levels after 48 h of depletion with
  the indicated siRNAs. α-Tubulin was used as a loading control. (D) SEC23A rescue
  experiment. Cells were cotransfected with the indicated siRNAs and a cDNA encoding
  SEC23A-YFP. After 60 h of transfection, the VSVG assay was performed. Based on the
  intensity of the YFP channel, cells were divided into non-expressing, low-expressing,
  and high-expressing. Bars represent averages of three independent experiments, and
  dots, the individual values. Statistical significance: *, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.01
  compared with control, Student’s t test. Source data are available for this figure:
