caption: Construction and exploration of the SLC score in the meta-GEO cohort. (A)
  The up (yellow)- and downregulated (blue) genes in all five SLC gene subtypes (middle).
  A gene ontology analysis depicted the enriched pathways of the genes downregulated
  (left) and upregulated (right) in patients in the SLC-S2 subtype. Circle size represents
  the number of genes enriched in this pathway. Circle color depth indicates p value.
  (B) Heatmap shows the expression of 133 genes consisting of SLC score in five SLC
  gene subtypes after dimension reduction using the Boruta algorithm. SLC gene subtypes
  are used as sample annotations of the heatmaps. (C) Circus plots showing the expression
  level and survival impact of 113 selected genes used for calculating SLC score (red,
  risk factor for relapse-free survival; green, protect factor for relapse-free survival).
  (D) Principal component analysis of 113 selected genes to distinguish SLC-S2 from
  other SLC gene subtypes. (E–F) Violin plot (left) of SLC score value in five SLC
  gene subtypes and receiver operating curve of SLC score (right) in the GSE39582
  (E) and non GSE39582 samples (F) of the meta-GEO cohort. (G) The correlations of
  the SLC score with tumor microenvironment (lower) and biological pathway activation
  status (upper) in the meta-GEO cohort. (H) Sankey diagram of SLC score groups in
  groups with different molecular subtypes in the GSE39582 cohort. (I–J) Kaplan-Meier
  curves of relapse-free survival (I) and overall survival (J) in the meta-GEO cohort
  according to the SLC score. (K) Forest plot (upper) of associations between the
  SLC score and overall survival in subgroups stratified by adjuvant chemotherapy
  conduction in the GSE39582 cohort. Forest plot (down) of benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy
  in different SLC score groups in the GSE39582 cohort. (L) Violin plot of SLC score
  values among patients with different fluorouracil responses in the meta-GEO cohort.
  SLC, solute carrier; ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy; RFS, relapse-free survival; OS,
  overall survival; CI, confidence interval; HMC, histone modification cluster; CMS,
  consensus molecular subtypes; TMEC, tumor microenvironment cluster; R, response;
  NR, nonresponse; and ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)
