figure_title: Tumor cell state heterogeneity is associated with patient prognosis
caption: (A) Overall survival of all patients with low number of clusters (Clonality-Low)
  and high number of clusters (Clonality-High) separated by the median value.(B and
  C) Overall survival of all the patients from different branches, by using three-group
  comparison (B) and two-group comparison (C).(D) Overall survival of HCC patients
  from different branches.(E) The enriched pathways of tumors from BI-A, BI-B and
  BI-C. Only tumors with more than two clusters detected as well as at least one enriched
  pathway with FDR adjusted q value < 0.05 were involved in the heatmap. NES, normalized
  enrichment score.(F) Functional analysis of clusters within each tumor. Top three
  panels show the expression of hypoxia, EMT and angiogenesis related genes in each
  sub-cluster of the tumors from BI-A, BI-B and BI-C. Bottom three panels show the
  expression of hypoxia, EMT and angiogenesis related genes on the UMAP of several
  representative tumors. Line segments in the jitter plot indicate the mean values.Log-rank
  test and log-rank test for trend were preformed to show the statistical significance
  in (A-D).
