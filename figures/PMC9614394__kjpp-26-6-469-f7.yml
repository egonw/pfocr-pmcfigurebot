figure_title: Effects of phospholipase C (PLC) (A), protein kinase C (PKC) (B) and
  TAK1 (C) antagonists on Wnt agonist 1-induced ATF2 expression in beating rat atria
caption: 'Data were expressed as means ± SE. n = 5. Cont, control; Wnta1, Wnt agonist
  1; U, U73122; Go, Gö6983, TI, TAK1 inhibitor, an inhibitor of TAK1; p-ATF2, phospho-ATF2;
  t-ATF2, total-ATF2. *p < 0.05 vs. control, #p < 0.05 vs. Wnta1.'
