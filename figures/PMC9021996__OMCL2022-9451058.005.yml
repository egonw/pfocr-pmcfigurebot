caption: miR-1a-3p participated in the atherosclerotic process through the sFRP1/Wnt/PCP-JNK
  axis. (a) The results from the online prediction tools for miR-1a-3p. (b) The mRNA
  levels of sFRP1 after NC and miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor transfection (n = 3 per group).
  (c) WB analyses of sFRP1 after NC and miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor transfection (n
  = 3 per group). (d) Sequence alignment of miR-1a-3p and the sFRP1 3′-UTR binding
  sites. Luciferase activity in different groups after transfection. (e) The mRNA
  levels of sFRP1 after treatment with ox-LDL and ox-LDL + EPA (0 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM,
  200 μM, 400 μM, 600 μM, and 800 μM) (normalized to GAPDH) (n = 3 per group). (f)
  WB analyses of sFRP1, p-JNK, and JNK after ox-LDL treatment and NC/miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor
  transfection (n = 3 per group). (g) WB analyses of p-JNK and JNK after NC/miR-1a-3p
  mimic and sFRP1 NC/OE plasmid transfection (n = 3 per group). (h) The mRNA levels
  of sFRP1 after NC/miR-1a-3p mimic/inhibitor transfection on the basis of ox-LDL
  + 200 μM EPA (n = 3 per group). (i) WB analyses of p-JNK and JNK after NC/miR-1a-3p
  mimic/inhibitor transfection on the basis of ox-LDL + 200 μM EPA (n = 3 per group).
  The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05,  ∗∗p < 0.01, and∗∗∗p < 0.001.
