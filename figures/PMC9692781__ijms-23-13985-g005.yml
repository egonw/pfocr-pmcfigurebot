caption: Composition of surrogate striatal neuron end targets and functionality of
  bidirectional TE-NSPs. (a) Representative confocal reconstruction at 14 DIV showing
  a striatal neuronal end target labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote neuronal
  somata and dendrites (MAP-2, red) and medium spiny neurons (DARPP-32, purple), with
  nuclear counterstain (Hoechst, blue). (b,c) Representative confocal reconstruction
  at 14 DIV of a striatal aggregate end target within a bidirectional, enriched TE-NSP.
  The striatal aggregate was labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote striatal neurons
  (DARPP-32, green), the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R, red), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN,
  purple) with nuclear counterstain (Hoechst, blue). As expected, striatal neurons
  express the dopamine D1 receptor on their cell bodies, as well as along their neurites.
  (d,e) FSCV was used to measure dopamine release from the striatal end of bi-directional
  TENSPs (n = 6). Representative color plots displaying the current recorded as the
  potential of the carbon fiber electrode were linearly scanned from −0.4 to 1.2 V
  and back to −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl every 100 ms (bottom). Cross-sections from the color
  plots display individual cyclic voltammograms exhibiting an oxidation peak at 0.65
  V and a reduction trough at −0.3 V, which are characteristic of dopamine (inset).
  Representative time vs. concentration plots of the evoked dopamine release (top).
  (d) Intrinsic dopamine release was recorded from striatal aggregates within bidirectional
  enriched dopaminergic TE-NSPs; the carbon-fiber recording electrode was placed within
  the striatal aggregate. (e) Evoked dopamine release was also recorded from striatal
  aggregates within bidirectional enriched dopaminergic TE-NSPs; the stimulating electrode
  was positioned to span the striatal aggregate while the carbon-fiber recording electrode
  was placed within the striatal aggregate. Scale bar (a) = 100 µm. Scale bar (b,c)
  = 20 µm.
