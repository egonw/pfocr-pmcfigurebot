caption: L-type Ca2+ channels and ERK1/2 signalling contribute to G1-mediated vasorelaxation.
  In uterine arteries, inhibition of L-type calcium channels with verapamil (10−5
  M, (A)) and of ERK1/2 pathway with PD 098,059 (10−6 M, (B)) significantly reduced
  vasorelaxation to G1 (10−8 M). *** p < 0.001, G1 vs. G1 + verapamil (n = 6); * p
  < 0.05, G1 vs. G1 + PD 090,859 (n = 5), by t-test.
