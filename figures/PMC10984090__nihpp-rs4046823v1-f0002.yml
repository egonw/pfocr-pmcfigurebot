figure_title: eCNTFR-Fc alters the immune microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma
caption: a. Tumors were treated with either vehicle or eCNTFR-Fc for 1- or 3-weeks.
  Plot shows relative enrichment for immune cells where circle size is % among all
  immune cells and color is enrichment compared to vehicle treated cells. b-c. Differential
  gene expression analysis of the effector immune cell populations after treatment
  with eCNTFR-Fc. b. CD8+ T cells and NKT cells population after one week treatment
  with eCNTFR-Fc. c. CD8+ T cells and NKT cells population after three weeks treatment
  with eCNTFR-Fc. d. GSEA analysis of the MAPK Pathway effector T cells at the 3-week
  timepoint. e. Differential protein analysis of immune regions at 3 weeks post treatment
  with eCNTFR-Fc where green is up in eCNTFR-Fc treated and orange is down in eCNTFR-Fc
  treated. f. Violin plots of protein expression for CD28, MHC II and PD-1. g. Violin
  plots of LY6G/LY6C expression at one- and three-weeks post eCNTFR-Fc treatment.
