caption: 'Inhibitory effects on melanogenesis (A) and tyrosinase activity (B) of the
  TPS on HEM cells. HEM cells were divided into two groups including UVA-treated (15
  J/cm2) and untreated. Both groups were then incubated with the samples (0, 5, 10,
  and 15 μg/ml). TPS significantly reduced melanin pigments and tyrosinase activity.
  Data from the blank control group was set to 1. Results are presented as means ±
  SEMs for the experiment. *P < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus non-treated
  cells, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus UVA-treated cells'
