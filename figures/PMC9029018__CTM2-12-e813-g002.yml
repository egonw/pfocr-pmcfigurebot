caption: 'High Kindlin‐1 expression is associated with the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) pathway in breast cancer cell lines and tumours. (A) Correlation
  between EGFR and Kindlin‐1 mRNA expression levels in 976 breast tumours from The
  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Spearman''s rank correlation test). (B) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) plot showing the enrichment of the EGFR pathway in breast tumours
  from TCGA with high mRNA expression of Kindlin‐1 (n = 72/976). C. Kindlin‐1 and
  EGFR immunohistochemical staining in breast tumours from three different patients
  with luminal A (Lum A) or triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These tumours
  are representative cases of a series of 62 carcinomas from patients treated at the
  Curie Hospital. (D) Scatter plot showing Kindlin‐1 protein expression in the same
  series as in (D). Cases were categorised as low versus high EGFR protein expression.
  Each point represents the H‐score from a single tissue sample ranging from total
  absence of Kindlin‐1 in the epithelial compartment (H‐score 0) to very strong Kindlin‐1
  staining (H‐score 300). (E) Kaplan–Meier curve showing metastasis‐free survival
  of TNBC patients with respect to EGFR and Kindlin‐1 expression. Patients were divided
  into three categories: low expression of both EGFR and Kindlin‐1 (blue line); single
  overexpression of EGFR or Kindlin‐1 (green line); concomitant overexpression of
  EGFR and Kindlin‐1 (red line) (log‐rank test)'
