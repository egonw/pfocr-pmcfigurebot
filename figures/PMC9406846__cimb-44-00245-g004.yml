caption: Osteopontin signaling in cardiac endothelial cells. A number of factors induce
  osteopontin (OPN) expression in cardiac endothelial cells including angiotensin-II
  (Ang-II), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and dexamethasone (DEX).
  In turn, osteopontin regulates several cellular processes in cardiac endothelial
  cells via modulating certain signaling pathways. These pathways include osteopontin-induced
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and subsequent VEGF-mediated
  expression of pro-angiogenic factors, inhibition of cardiac endothelial cell apoptosis
  via blocking mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. Osteopontin signaling in cardiac
  endothelial cells results in increased apoptosis resistance, increased cell proliferation,
  and new vessels formation.
