caption: CHI3L1 regulates the proliferation, migration and survival of glioma cells.
  (A-B) The mRNA expression of inflammatory factors in U87MG and A172 cells. (C-D)
  Colony formation assay was performed in U87MG cells. (E-F) Proliferation curve of
  CFSE labelled A172 cells. (G-I) Proliferation of U87MG and A172 cells evaluated
  by EdU incorporation assay. (J-M) Migration of U87MG and A172 cells evaluated by
  wound healing assay. (N) The infection efficacy of the lentivirus. (O) The knockdown
  efficiency of the shCHI3L1 lentrivirus. (P) Proliferations of U87MG cells with or
  without CHI3L1 knockdown evaluated by CCK-8 assay. Student's t test, *p < 0.05,
  compared with the shCHI3L1 group. (Q) The growth rates and size of the control tumors
  and the tumors with CHI3L1 knockdown. Student's t test, *p < 0.05, compared with
  the shCHI3L1 group. (R) The working model of CHI3L1 on glioma cells and TME. Student's
  t test, *p < 0.05, *p < 0.01, compared with the shCtrl group.
