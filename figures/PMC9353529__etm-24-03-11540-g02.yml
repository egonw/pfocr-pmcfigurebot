caption: 'Effect of ROCK2 silencing on apoptosis-associated protein expression in
  LPS-induced HK-2 cells. The protein expression of Bcl2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3/caspase
  3 and cleaved PARP/PARP was measured and semi-quantified using western blotting.
  ***P<0.001 vs. control; ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + shRNA-NC. ROCK2, Rho-associated protein
  kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; sh, short hairpin; NC, negative control; PARP,
  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.'

  of renal tubular epithelial cells via the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.
