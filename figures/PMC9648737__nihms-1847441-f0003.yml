figure_title: NUAK OE phenocopies loss of insulin pathway outputs
caption: (A) Box and whisker plot reveals that mef2-induced NUAK OE or reduced insulin
  signaling reduces pupal size. This phenotype is also evident upon overexpression
  of mef2>mthl8_HA. The well characterized Tb mutation, present on a TMB balancer
  chromosome, was used as a control for small body size. (B) Western blot using pAkt
  (top panel) as a readout of insulin pathway activity. Expression of mef2>InR DN
  or mef2>NUAK 550 abolishes activated pAkt signal, while total Akt protein levels
  are unchanged (bottom panel). (C) Single section confocal images of pFOXO staining.
  pFOXO is pre-dominantly localized in the cytoplasm in mef2>lacZ control larval muscle,
  but translocates to the nucleus upon NUAK OE for the activation of FOXO target genes.
  Scale bar, 10 μm. Line plot depicts the average relative intensity of pFOXO immunoreactivity
  corresponding to a 40 μm distance that spans individual nuclei (n = 10 for each
  genotype). (D) Representative maximum intensity projections of larval non-endoreplicating
  (brain and wing disc) or endoreplicating (salivary gland and midgut) tissues from
  mef2>lacZ or mef2>NUAK 548 animals stained with DAPI (blue) and F-actin (green).
  Scale bar, 100 μm. (E) Quantitation of the area of individual larval tissues. Expression
  of NUAK or negative regulators of insulin signaling (FOXO or PTEN) in muscle tissues
  generally reduced the size of all tissues examined compared to that of control mef2>lacZ.
  For all graphs, letters indicate significant differences between genotypes (p <
  0.05).
