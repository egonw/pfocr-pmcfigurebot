caption: (A) Schematic diagram of TMZ and its relationship to the MMR, DSB, and MGMT
  pathways. TMZ adds a methyl group to guanine at the O6 position, creating O6-methylguanine
  that incorrectly pairs with thymine. The mispairing continuously activates the MMR
  pathway, resulting in DSBs and apoptosis. MGMT removes the methyl group from O6-methylguanine
  and prevents the activation of the MMR pathway. LncRNA UCA1 is shown to indirectly
  increase MGMT expression level. (B) Schematic diagram of TMZ and the BER and SSB
  pathways. TMZ adds a methyl group to guanine and adenine, forming N7-methylguanine
  and N3-methyladenine that are recognized by the BER pathway. When the bases are
  excised, SSBs result, creating instability that results in cell death. Me, methyl;
  G, guanine; C, cytosine; T, thymine.
