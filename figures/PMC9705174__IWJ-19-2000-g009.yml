caption: Schematics illustrating the probable involvement of RhoA/ROCK/PI3K/Akt pathway
  underlying the efficacy of Fasudil at simultaneously improving flap survival and
  reinnervation. (A) Norepinephrine‐induced vasospasm through the RhoA/ROCK pathway.
  Flap harvest leads to severance of sympathetic nerves entering the flap, releasing
  norepinephrine, which activates GEF that transforms inactivated RhoA‐GDP to activated
  RhoA‐GTP. The activated RhoA then regulates ROCK to phosphorylate CPI‐17. Phosphorylated
  CPI‐17 or ROCK can both phosphorylate MYPT1, the regulatory subunit of MLCP, to
  inhibit MLCP activity. Inhibited MLCP favours interaction between phosphorylated
  myosin and actin, leading to contraction of vascular smooth muscles. (B) Inhibition
  of RhoA/ROCK pathway leads to vascular dilation, angiogenesis, and extension of
  axonal growth cone. Fasudil, a validated inhibitor of ROCK, results in dephosphorylation
  of CPI‐17 and MYPT1, leading to strengthened activity of MLCP, thus favouring the
  separation of myosin and actin, which causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscles
  and extension of axonal growth cone. Also, our study demonstrates that inhibition
  of ROCK by Fasudil can phosphorylate and activate PI3K and Akt, which also can lead
  to dephosphorylation of MYTP1. And this indirect pathway seems to override the direct
  pathway, because inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway results in total abolition of the
  efficacy of Fasudil and upregulation of p‐MYPT1. Since significant upregulation
  of p‐PTEN can be caused by Fasudil, it indicates the potential involvement of p‐PTEN
  serving as an intermediate factor between ROCK and PI3K. CPCRs, C protein‐coupled
