caption: 'Effect of DSS-induced colitis on Ccndbp1-knockout mice. (A) Experimental
  design for dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model mice (n = 8–10). (B)
  For each group, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) score were assessed
  on day 0, 5, and 8 after DSS initiation. DAI was assessed according to a previously
  reported scoring system, which includes the body weight loss, stool consistency,
  and rectal bleeding (maximum score: 12 points). The values represent the mean ±
  standard deviation (SD), * p < 0.05, Welch’s t-test. Each symbol represents the
  data of each mouse. (C) Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin staining
  of the colonic mucosa. Scale bar, 100 µm. (D) Time-dependent changes in the histological
  score, which includes the severity of inflammation, crypt damage, and ulceration
  (maximum score: 11 points). The values represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD)
  (n = 8–10), *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s
  test. Each symbol represents the data of each mouse. WT: wild-type, P: proximal
  colon, D: distal colon.'
