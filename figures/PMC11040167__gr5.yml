caption: Effect of ATR on the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) the relative fluorescence
  intensity of ROS (n = 3); The magnification of the microscopic images is 200 times
  the original size; (B) ROS level in different groups; (C) IF of Nrf2, nuclei were
  detected by DAPI staining (blue), Alexa Fluor 488 (red), Merge represents the synthesis
  of DAPI and Alexa Fluor 488; (D) The heat map of Nrf2 downstream related gene. Values
  are shown as the mean Â± SD. The symbols for the significant differences between
  the control and other groups were represented as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P
  < 0.001 vs control.
