caption: SALL4 expression analysis and prognostic value in breast cancer patients.
  (A) Boxplot to compare the RNA expression level of SALL4 in breast invasive carcinoma
  (BRCA) vs. normal breast tissue samples from the oncoDB database. (B) Gene expression
  analysis indicated the SALL4 expression level in the main intrinsic or molecular
  subtypes of breast cancer tissues from the TCGA database. Differential expression
  analysis is conducted with Student’s t-test, taking normal or low expression subtype
  as reference. (C–F) In-silico overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free
  survival (DMFS) analysis; (C,D) of SALL4 in all breast cancer patients (ALL) and
  (E,F) HER2+ subtypes patients from PAM50 database included in the Kaplan–Meier Plot
  tool. Patients were split by median value and the follow-up was 120 months. Student’s
  t-test compared the results. * p-value ≤ 0.05 and ** p-value ≤ 0.01.
