caption: 'GSTZ1 loss activates transforming growth factor‐β/Smad signalling. (A) RNA
  sequencing analysis of top 10 significantly down‐regulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways between AdGSTZ1‐ and AdGFP‐infected Huh7 cells
  (n = 3, each). (B) Heatmap of TGFβ/Smad pathway‐related differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) identified based on the following criteria: false discovery rate < 0.05
  and fold change > 1.5 or < 0.666. (C–E) TGFβ/Smad‐mediated gene transcriptional
  activities in GSTZ1‐OE (C and D) or ‐KO (E) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
  as assessed by smad binding element (SBE)‐luciferase assays (n = 3). (F and G) Intracellular
  localization of Smad2/3 (red) in GSTZ1‐OE Huh7 (F) or GSTZ1‐KO SNU‐449 cells (G).
  (H and I) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear Smad2/3 protein expression
  in GSTZ1‐OE Huh7 (H) or GSTZ1‐KO SNU‐449 (I) cells. β‐tubulin and laminB1 served
  as quality control for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. (J) Model
  of activation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway. (K and P) Quantification of the migrated
  cells and immunoblots of the epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT)‐related
  proteins in GSTZ1‐OE Huh7 cells supplemented with or without TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml, 24 h)
  (K and L), and GSTZ1‐KO SNU‐449 cells transfected with shSmad2 (M and N) or supplemented
  with SB431542 (10 μM, 36 h) (O and P). Data are mean ± SD. p‐Values were derived
  from an unpaired, two‐tailed Student''s t‐test in (C–E); one‐way Analysis of Variance
  (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test in (K, M, and O) (**p < .01, ***p < .001).'
