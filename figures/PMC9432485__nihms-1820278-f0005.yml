figure_title: Immune functional markers and survival vary with polyamine pathway ssGSEA
  scores across T infiltrated tumors. Ten of the mostly highly inflamed cancer types
  were stratified by T cell infiltration status (Thi vs Tlo) inferred using TCGA bulk
  RNAseq data as described in the manuscript
caption: '(A) Correlation between polyamine ssGSEA scores and REACTOME IFNÎ³ pathway
  (upper) and cytotoxic lymphocyte pathway (lower) ssGSEA scores are shown in the
  heatmaps. Correlation coefficients (r) for the correlation between polyamine ssGSEA
  score and immune pathway ssGSEA score for each cancer type are presented in the
  heatmap. (B) Pan-cancer Cox regression analysis among the Thi tumors for each cancer
  type was performed using continuous polyamine ssGSEA scores as a covariate. Log2
  hazard ratios (HR) are plotted. Diamonds represent statistically significant associations
  (Log test -log2 p-value, FDR q < 0.25) and circles represent non-significant associations;
  size of shape represents magnitude of the q-value. (C) Survival among Nivolumab-treated
  Thi melanomas (n = 11) by combined (left panel; high: n = 4, low: n = 7), synthesis
  (middle panel; high = 5, low = 6), or transport (right panel; high: n = 7, low:
  n = 4) polyamine ssGSEA score strata. (D) Barplots showing proportion of complete
  or partial responders (CR/PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD)
  given combined (left panel), synthesis (middle panel), or transport (right panel)
  polyamine ssGSEA score strata.'
