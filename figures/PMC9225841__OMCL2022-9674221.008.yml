caption: 'SEMA6D exerted regulatory effect in OA by inhibiting p38 pathway. The results
  of qRT-PCR of anabolism-related proteins including ID1 (a), COL2A1 (b), and Aggrecan
  (c). D. The expression levels of anabolism-related proteins including Aggrecan,
  ID1, and COL2A1 and p38 pathway-related proteins including p-p38 and p38 were measured
  by western blotting. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05, compared with the control
  group; ###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01.'
