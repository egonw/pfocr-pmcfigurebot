caption: Metabolic pathways associated with PSC and PBC. Pathways enriched in disease‐associated
  metabolites were identified using Mummichog and grouped based on major biological
  function. Position of the dot on the x‐axis corresponds to the −log P value calculated
  for the pathway; and size of the dot corresponds to the number of metabolites meeting
  the FDR threshold of <20% in the pathway.
