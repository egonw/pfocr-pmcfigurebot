caption: Identification of FOXP3 as a unique marker for human Tregs and analysis of
  FOXP3hiand FOXP3lowenriched genes. (A) Treg clusters are combined to one Treg population
  and visualized for FOXP3 expression in all cell types. Data extracted from . (B)
  Visualization of differently expressed genes in Treg cluster versus non-Treg cluster
  in different cell types. (C) FOXP3, TTN, and AC133644.2 expression in Treg and non-Treg
  clusters. (D) GO terms enrichment pathway analysis of genes associated with FOXP3high
  and FOXP3low by using Metascape Pathway analysis tool. Data were analyzed using
  differentially expressed genes from 19 FOXP3high- and 20 FOXP3low-expressing biopsies.
