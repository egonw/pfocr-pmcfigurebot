caption: (A, B) The comparison of LAG-3 expression between peripheral and decidual
  T cells in NP and early-onset PE. Statistical comparisons were made by paired t
  test. Data are presented as the mean±SEM. P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically
  significant. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01. NP – normal pregnancy; Early-onset PE – early-onset
  preeclampsia. GraphPad Prism software, version 7 (GraphPad) was used to create the
  figures.
