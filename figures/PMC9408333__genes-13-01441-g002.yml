caption: Divergent pathway and gene expression between wild-type and gluk2−/− mutant.
  (A) Number of DEGs obtained from the six tissues at the wild-type and gluk2−/− mutant.
  (B) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified
  from the wild-type and gluk2−/− mutant. The abscissa represents the GO terms, and
  the ordinate represents the number of target genes. Black arrow indicates the ‘Response
  to temperature stimulus’ pathway. (C) Protein–protein interaction network for gluk2−/−
  expressed in the response to temperature stimulus pathway. (D) Fragments Per Kilobase
  per Million (FPKM) of divergent gene expression related to temperature signaling
  pathway in different tissues. Values plotted are means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared with control.
