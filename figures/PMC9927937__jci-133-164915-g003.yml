figure_title: Lgr4 ablation disrupts the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, resulting
  in adrenal hypoplasia and aberrant zonal differentiation
caption: '(A) RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA encoding Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway–associated
  genes. (B) Immunohistochemical detection of β-catenin and Lef1. (C) LEF1+ cell index,
  defined as the percentage of LEF1+ cells over the total number of cortical cells.
  (D) Adrenal weight. (E) H&E staining of WT and Lgr4cKO adrenals. (F) Number of cortical
  cells per 500 μm2 of the cortex. (G) Coimmunostaining for Akr1b7 and Dab2 in WT
  and Lgr4cKO adrenals. (H) RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA encoding zone-specific markers
  (Akr1b7, Dab2, and Hsd3b6). All analyses were conducted in 5-week-old WT and Lgr4cKO
  female mice. zF, zona fasciculata; zG, zona glomerulosa; M, medulla; Co, cortex.
  Scale bars: 50 μm. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. Numbers of individual samples
  analyzed are indicated within the bars. Statistical analyses in A, C, D, F, and
  H were conducted using Mann-Whitney tests in GraphPad Prism 9. *P < 0.05, ***P <
  0.001, ****P < 0.0001.'
