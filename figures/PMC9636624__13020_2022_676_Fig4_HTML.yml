caption: Differential lipid-related DEGs regulate lipid metabolism in the PPAR signaling
  pathway. The colors of each cell from left to right in the heatmaps represent the
  gene expression trends among G31, G38, G42, and G46. Gene expression levels are
  expressed in FPKM values. Fatty acid binding protein (FABP), retinoid x receptor
  (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa
  synthase 2 (HMGCS2), apolipoprotein (Apo), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP),
  malic enzyme 1 (ME1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), cytochrome p450 family 27 (CYP27),
  cytochrome p450 family 7 subfamily a member 1 (CYP7A1), cytochrome p450 family 8
  subfamily b member 1 (CYP8B1), acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), cd36 antigen (FATCD36),
  enoyl-CoA hydratase (BIEN), sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-X), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO),
  carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), adipocyte (AP2), adiponectin (ADIPO),
  sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 1 (CAP), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP),
  ubiquitin C (UBC), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
