caption: ARCND2-associated PLCB4 mutants exert dominant-negative interference of the
  EDNRA signaling pathway. (A) Schematic showing how BRET is achieved in response
  to EDN1. Upon translocation-induced proximity, luminescence (460 nm) from the rLuc8-C1A
  BRET donor excites the Lyn-Venus BRET acceptor, resulting in fluorescence emission
  (540 nm) (ΔBRET; see Materials and Methods). (B) ΔBRET response after EDN1 stimulation
  (arrow) in HEK293T cells co-transfected with rLuc8-C1A, Lyn-Venus and wild-type
  EDNRA or a loss-of-function EDNRA mutant (p.Gln381Pro). ΔBRET traces are an average
  of three experiments. Shaded boxes represent s.e.m. (C) The Gq/11-specific inhibitor
  YM-254890 attenuates the EDN1-stimulated maximum ΔBRET response in cells transfected
  with BRET sensor components and EDNRA. Each point represents an average of at least
  three experiments. (D) Representative western blots of cells transfected with the
  indicated amount (nanograms; ng) of plasmid. (E) ΔBRET response after EDN1 stimulation
  (arrow) in cells co-transfected with BRET sensor components, EDNRA and differing
  amounts of wild-type PLCB4 and PLCB4 p.Arg621His. ΔBRET traces are an average of
  three (0:0, 500:0 and 0:500), four (450:50) or five (250:250) individual experiments.
  (F) Quantification of the maximum ΔBRET response in E. Data points are individual
  experiments with n values listed in E. Error bars represent s.e.m. Statistical significance
  was calculated using Prism and an unpaired two-tailed t-test (mock transfection
  versus 500:0, P=0.093; 500:0 versus 450:50, P=0.0372; 500:0 versus 250:250, P=0.037;
  500:0 versus 0:500, P=0.0017). (G) ΔBRET response after EDN1 stimulation (arrow)
  in cells co-transfected with BRET sensor components, EDNRA and wild-type PLCB4 or
  the indicated PLCB4 mutant. Traces are an average of three experiments, except for
  p.Glu358Val (n=4). (H) Quantification of the maximum ΔBRET response in G. Data points
  are individual experiments with n values listed in G. Error bars represent s.e.m.
  Statistical significance versus wild type was calculated using Prism and an unpaired
  two-tailed t-test (p.Tyr623Cys, P=0.032; p.Glu358Val, P=0.015; p.Asp360Val, P=0.0018).
  *P<0.05; **P<0.01. IB, immunoblot antibody; ns, not significant.
