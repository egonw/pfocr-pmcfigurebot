caption: 'A proposed model of MoPtc1 and MoPtc2 functioning as regulators of cell
  wall integrity during stress and pathogenicity in Magnaporthe oryzae. MoPtc1 and
  MoPtc2 dephosphorylate MoMkk1 to ensure phosphorylation homeostasis of the cell
  wall integrity pathway: under cell wall stress, MoPtc1 enhances the interaction
  with MoMkk1 while MoPtc2 destroys the interaction with MoMkk1 in response to cell
  wall integrity stress'

  for the growth and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae .
