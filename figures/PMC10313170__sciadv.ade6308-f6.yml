figure_title: Metabolites of Sia synthesis pathway are elevated in NPL-deficient mice
caption: Levels of Neu5Ac (A), Neu5Gc (B), and Sia-nucleotides, CMP-Neu5Ac (C) and
  CMP-Neu5Gc (D), were measured in muscle tissues of WT, Npldel116, NplR63C, and ManNAc-treated
  NplR63C mice. Levels of total Sia (E), Neu5Ac (F), and Neu5Gc (G) were measured
  in urine of WT, Npldel116, NplR63C, and ManNAc-treated NplR63C mice. Graphs show
  individual values, means, and SD for the experiments performed with five to seven
  mice per group. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA test with
  a Tukey post hoc test.
