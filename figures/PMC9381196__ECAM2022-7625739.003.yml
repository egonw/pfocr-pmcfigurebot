caption: RA model mice were induced by collagen antibodies. Lentivirus encapsulated
  AXL, oe-AXL, and oe-NC were injected into left and right ankle joints. (a-f) ELISA
  was used to detect the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α, and NO production in synovial
  tissue of joints (a-c) and serum (d-f). (g-i) Western blot was applied to detect
  the expression trend of inflammatory proteins iNOS and COX-2 in joint synovium.
