caption: Values assessed by nociception monitors during surgery under general anesthesia.
  The degree of balance between nociception caused by surgical trauma and anti-nociception
  provided by anesthesia affects surgical stress responses, consisting of both neuroendocrine-metabolic
  and inflammatory-immune responses. The degree of balance between inflammation caused
  by surgical trauma and anti-inflammation due to anesthetic management, preoperative
  morbidity, and perioperative management (e.g., ERAS, prehabilitation) also affect
  surgical stress responses. On the other hand, the balance between nociception and
  anti-nociception receives feedback regulation from the descending pain inhibitory
  pathway and baroreflex function (white arrow with black outline). The balance between
  inflammation and anti-inflammation also receives feedback regulation from the endocrine
  response (e.g., cortisol) (white arrow with gray outline). The surgical stress response
  plays a role in sustaining patient homeostasis and supporting postoperative recovery.
  An excessive degree of surgical trauma and preoperative morbidity, however, exacerbates
  surgical stress responses, potentially causing postoperative complications. Nociception
  monitors using autonomic responses (e.g., ANI, SPI, NoL, NR, PPI) represent different
  aspects of intraoperative surgical stress, in addition to the balance between nociception
  and anti-nociception. ANI; analgesia nociception index, ERAS; enhanced recovery
  after surgery, NoL; nociception level, NR; nociceptive response, PPI; pupillary
  pain index, SPI; surgical pleth index.
