caption: Lipid unsaturation decreased upon SCD1 inhibition. (A) Biosynthetic pathways
  of monounsaturated FA. SCD1 and SCD5, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and 5; FADS2, fatty
  acid desaturase 2; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; Elovl, fatty acid elongase. (B) Mass
  spectra of PC profile before and after SCD1 inhibition in MCF-7 cells. (C and D)
  The relative ratios of PC 32:1/PC 32:0 and PE 34:1/PE 34:0. Differences between
  CAY10566-treated group samples and control group samples were evaluated for statistical
  significance using the 2-tailed Studentâ€™s t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001). Error bar represents the standard deviation, n = 3.
