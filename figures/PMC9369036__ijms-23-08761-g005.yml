caption: Cotreatment with PF-4708671 or V-9302 and paclitaxel upregulates the phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2 and downregulates the cellular level of Mcl-1 in SKOV3-TR cells. (A,B)
  SKOV3-TR cells were cotreated with 20 μM of PF-4708671 or 20 μM of V-9302 and 100
  nM paclitaxel for 48 h, and the expression of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1,
  Bid, Bak, Bax, and Bad), the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at the serine 70 residue and
  Bad at serine 112 residue, and XIAP were then analyzed by immunoblotting. (C) Transcriptional
  level of Mcl-1 was analyzed by RT-PCR in SKOV3-TR cells cotreated with PF-4708671
  or V-9302 and paclitaxel for 48 h. Protein expression was quantified as fold changes
  with respect to the control after normalization of respective β-actin levels using
  ImageJ software. PTX, paclitaxel.
