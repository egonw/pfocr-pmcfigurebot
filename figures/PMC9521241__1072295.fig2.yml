caption: Abrogation of constitutively-activated PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling with temsirolimus
  therapy. Pre-treatment (basal, day 0) and post-treatment (day 3-5) levels of PI3K/mTOR
  pathway phosphoproteins were measured as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) by
  single-cell phosphoflow cytometry in gated B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
  or T-ALL cells in peripheral blood specimens from TACL2014-001 patients. Phosphoprotein
  inhibition in peripheral blood ALL cells at day 3-5 of therapy after the first dose
  of temsirolimus in comparison to basal phosphoprotein levels is shown for each patient
  treated at the designated dose levels (DL1, DL2, DL3, DL4). MFI data were normalized
  intra-patient to pre-treatment levels of each phosphoprotein. Central horizontal
  solid lines depict mean phosphoprotein inhibition for inter-patient comparison.
  Dotted line set at y=0 indicates no change in phosphoprotein from baseline. Solid
  symbols represent patients with partial response, stable disease, or progressive
  disease after cycle 1. Black-ringed symbols represent patients with complete response.
  Summary pharmacodynamic data of all dose levels are shown in Online Supplementary
  Figure S2.
