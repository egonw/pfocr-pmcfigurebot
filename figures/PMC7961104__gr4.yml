caption: 'Construction of trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic
  reactions in liver and skeletal muscle of ob/ob mice(A) The trans-omic network for
  differentially regulated metabolic reactions in the liver and skeletal muscle. Nodes
  and edges indicate differentially expressed molecules and differential regulations
  involved in metabolic reactions, respectively. Red, increased (nodes) or activating
  (edges) in ob/ob mice; blue, decreased (nodes) or inhibiting (edges) in ob/ob mice;
  magenta, controversial metabolic reactions had opposing regulatory input from Enzyme
  Protein layer and Metabolite layer. The numbers of differentially expressed molecules
  (nodes) and differential regulations (edges) are shown.(B) The number of differentially
  regulated metabolic reactions controlled by differentially expressed molecules in
  the Enzyme Protein layer or the Metabolite layer or both in the liver and skeletal
  muscle.(C) For each metabolic pathway in the liver and skeletal muscle, the percentage
  of activated (upper) or inhibited (lower) metabolic reactions by Metabolite (x axis)
  and by Enzyme Protein (y axis) are plotted. The size of the dots indicates the number
  of differentially regulated metabolic reactions in each metabolic pathway regulated
  either by Metabolite, Enzyme Protein, or both in each organ. The colors of the dots
  indicate the classes of metabolic pathway according to the KEGG database: carbohydrate
  (green), amino acid (blue), and lipid (red).(D) The number of differentially regulated
  metabolic reactions in each metabolic pathway (rows) regulated by each differentially
  regulated transcription factor (DRTF) (columns) in the liver and skeletal muscle.
  The sign ∗ indicates the significant associations (q value <0.01) between differentially
  regulated metabolic reactions in the metabolic pathway node and those regulated
  by the DRTF. The q value was calculated by one-tailed Fisher''s exact test.See also
