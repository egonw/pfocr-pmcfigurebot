caption: The mechanism of SSLF inhibition by Sjp40. Sjp40 inhibited STAT5 activity
  to promote MicroRNA-155 expression, which down-regulated FOXO3a to inhibit the proliferation
  and activation of HSCs and upregulation of Let-7b in HSCs to inhibit type I collagen
  expression. Sjp40 promotes cellular senescence in HSCs by upregulating the SKP2/P27
  signaling pathway. Sjp40 promotes Y-Box protein-1 (YB1) expression to initiate BMP-7
  transcription. Sjp40 promoted the P53/P21 signaling to inhibit cell proliferation,
  and P53 promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1. Inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  could inhibit SSLF.
