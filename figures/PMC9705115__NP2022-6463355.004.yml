caption: C-Fos expression in different sites of the auditory pathway. (a) Schematic
  of the primary ascending pathway and the descending modulatory pathway of acoustic
  startle response (ASR). (b) Immunofluorescence results of the caudal pontine reticular
  nucleus (PnC), the inferior colliculus (IC), dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), medial
  geniculate body (MGB), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the auditory cortex (AC).
  (c) The number of c-Fos-positive cells in the noise-exposed group was significantly
  higher than the control group in the PnC and DCN. (d) The proportion of c-Fos staining
  in different parts of the auditory pathway. The c-Fos in the DCN, PnC and VTA of
  the noise group was significantly higher than the control group (âˆ—p < 0.05).
