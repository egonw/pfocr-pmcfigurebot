caption: The mechanism of acupuncture protecting from neuroinflammation and neuronal
  sensitization of migraine. The yellow line through the brain represents the pain
  pathway. The factors are shown with up and down arrows, which represent up- or down-regulation
  from acupuncture. The pathways with minus on the line are inhibited by acupuncture.
