caption: Metformin induced cell apoptosis in endometrial carcinoma cells. Cell apoptosis
  rates were examined in Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells after 48 h metformin treatment
  (10 and 20 mM for Ishikawa and 8 mM for RL95-2) by flow cytometry. (a and b) Metformin
  increased the early and late apoptosis rates in Ishikawa cells, and the majority
  of apoptotic cells were at the late apoptosis stage. (c and d) The apoptosis percentage
  of RL95-2 cells increased in the metformin exposure group. (e and f) The ratio of
  Bcl-2/Bax decreased as the concentration of metformin increased in Ishikawa cells.
  Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times independently.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01 versus controls. Met,
  metformin; Con, control.
