caption: Schematic representation of the shared mechanisms between AD and T2DM. IR
  could stimulate amyloid deposition by reducing the degradation of Aβ by IDE and
  clearance of Aβ by impairing BBB. Furthermore, IR makes insulin signaling pathway
  conduction abnormal, leading to PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and its downstream molecules
  dysfunction. The impaired insulin signaling pathway elicits oxidative stress, energy
  metabolism dysfunction, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy
  dysfunction, and neuronal death ultimately, all of which promote cognitive impairment
  in AD. AD Alzheimer’s disease, T2DM Type 2 diabetes mellitus, IR Insulin resistance,
