caption: AuNPs induced apoptosis in A549 cells through a mitochondrial signalling
  pathway. (A) The expression of apoptosis-related protein levels detected by Western
  blot after A549 cells were incubated with 5, 15, and 30 µg/mL of different sizes
  of AuNPs for 24 h. MG132 (10 µg/m) was used as a positive control. The relative
  expression signal intensity of apoptosis-related proteins semi-quantified by ImageJ
  software for (B) 5 nm, (C) 10 nm, and (D) 80 nm AuNPs. Plotted graphs represent
  the means ± SD of three independent experiments. Bars with an asterisk (*) show
  a statistical difference (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001) when compared
  with the control.
