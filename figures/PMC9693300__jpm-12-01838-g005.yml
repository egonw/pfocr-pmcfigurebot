caption: Box plot analysis for candidate signatures of amides or fatty acids. ANOVA
  with posthoc tests were used to determine the p values of pairwise comparison between
  groups. The corresponding p values are labelled in the top area of the figure. The
  red texts in the upper left corner are the p values of ANOVA tests, and the black
  texts in the top are the p values of Tukey post-hoc tests. The orange in the facet
  background indicates that this feature is one of the candidate signatures from the
  multistep machine learning workflow. (A) Schematic of palmitic, stearic and oleic
  acid biosynthetic pathways derived from KEGG pathway maps. (B) Box-and-whisker plot
  for the general trends of 5 cholesteryl esters.
