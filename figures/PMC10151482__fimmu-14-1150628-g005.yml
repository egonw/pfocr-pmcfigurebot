caption: DEGs shared between the two comparison groups S4383-0-G vs R4345-0-G and
  S4383-6-G vs R4345-6-G. (A) Venn diagram showing the numbers of the shared DEGs.
  Upregulated genes in R4345 are marker with red arrow, down regulated genes in R4345
  are marked with green arrows, and the opposite expression trend in R4345 at 0 and
  6 h post-infection are marked with blue arrows. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the shared DEGs. The y-axis belongs to specific pathway, and the x-axis belongs
  to enrichment factor. The size and colors of the dots represent the number of genes
  and q values, respectively (The dots with larger-size indicated a higher number
  of genes in the pathway).
