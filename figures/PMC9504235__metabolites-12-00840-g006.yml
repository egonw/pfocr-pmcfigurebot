caption: 'The role of ATF3 as a central regulator of cholesterol metabolism in the
  human liver. Correlation of ATF3 expression with (A) LDLR and (B) MAFF expression
  in STARNET. (C) Correlation with CAD associated phenotypes in the liver supernetwork
  regulated by ATF3 based on expression. (D) Pathway analysis based on Gene Ontology
  terms derived from the liver supernetwork based on expression data. Red bars represent
  biological pathways, green cellular compartments and blue molecular functions. CAD:
  Coronary artery disease; GO: Gene Ontology; GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Pathway;
  GOCC: Gene Ontology Cell Compartment; GOMF: Gene Ontology Molecular Function; LDLR:
  low-density lipoprotein receptor; MAFF: MAF basic leucine zipper transcription factor
