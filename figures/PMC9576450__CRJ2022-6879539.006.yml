caption: 'Effect of signaling pathway inhibitors on VEGF-induced ASMC migration. (a)
  A representative image of cell migration. (b) The histogram shows the number of
  migrating cells in each group, and the data are expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation (M ± SD). ∗P < 0.05. #There are significant differences between the VEGF + SB203580
  group, VEGF + LY294002 group, and VEGF + Y27632 group and VEGF group (P < 0.05).'
