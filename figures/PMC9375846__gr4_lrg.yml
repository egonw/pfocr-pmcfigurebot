caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysisEach circle in the figure represents a KEGG
  pathway. The ordinate represents the pathway name, and the abscissa represents Enrichment
  Factor, which represents the ratio of the proportion of genes annotated to a pathway
  in the differential genes to the proportion of genes annotated to this pathway in
  all genes.
