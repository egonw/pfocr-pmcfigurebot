figure_title: Signaling pathways associated with NOX1/4 and EIF5B are differentially
  regulated following H-FIRE depending on CaCl2 or NaCl environment
caption: Gene expression profiling analysis identified biological functions specifically
  associated with NOX1, NOX4, EIF5B and the 60S ribosomal subunit that were significantly
  dysregulated following H-FIRE treatment and correlated with CaCl2 or NaCl containing
  buffer. (A) Individual expression of each of these genes was significantly and differentially
  regulated based on CaCl2 or NaCl. (B) Heatmap analysis reflects global changes in
  gene expression and revealed significant dysregulation among genes associated with
  NADPH oxidase activity, proliferation, cell death, calcium signaling, and cellular
  stress. Red is downregulated genes and green signifies upregulated genes. (C) Ingenuity
  pathway analysis of gene expression profiling data revealed differentially activated
  pathways, quantified by associated z-score, associated with increased proliferation
  and survival under NaCl conditions and increased necroptosis under CaCl2 conditions
  following H-FIRE. Here, red represents upregulated genes and green signifies downregulated
  genes. **p < 0.01.
