caption: A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identifying genes that impact resistance
  or sensitivity to LuTate. A) Schematic of the screen set up using H1299-7 cells
  and the Brunello CRISPR sgRNA library. B) Change in p-value over time for the top
  10 gene hits, five each from the resistance and sensitivity arms of the initial
  replicate of the screen. Control p-values for the 10 genes are in black, with the
  LuTate treated values in dark blue (for the sensitivity arm of the screen) and light
  blue (for the resistance arm of the screen). C) Comparison of growth rates for control
  and LuTate treated cells over the course of 21 days of the screen, in the two replicates
  of the screen. D and E) Plots of individual genes of the resistance arm (D) and
  sensitivity arm (E) of the screen, showing averaged p-value data from the two replicates
  at Day 21. Data is visualised as the comparison between control untreated p-values
  (on the X axis) and LuTate treated p-values (on the Y axis). The lower right quadrant
  in both plots contains genes significantly altered in response to LuTate (p-value
  <0.005), but unaltered in the control cells (p-value >0.05). In the resistance arm
  of the screen (D) blue dots are the two most significant hits, MVP and ARRB2 (Beta-Arrestin
  2), the red dot is SSTR2. In the sensitivity arm of the screen (E) green dots are
  those genes that, as members of the Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) DNA-strand
  break repair pathway, contributed to this pathway being the most significant GO
  biological process pathway identified (F).
