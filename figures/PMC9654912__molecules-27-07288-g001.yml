caption: Flowchart depicting process of extraction and bioassay-guided purification
  of Zanthoxylum armatum DC leaf extracts. Successive extractions using different
  solvents of increasing polarity (hexane < ethyl acetate < butanol < methanol < water)
  to purify bioactive fractions. The extracts were subjected to fractionation using
  silica column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
