caption: AKR1B1 overexpression highly impacts metabolism in 4T1 cells. (A) Volcano
  plot showing differential protein expression in 4T1-AKR1B1 cells relative to 4T1-GFP
  cells. Proteins identified by at least two unique peptides are represented (3822).
  Only proteins identified by at least two peptides, showing FC ≥ 2 (up- or downregulated)
  and p-value ≤ 0.05, were considered as differentially expressed proteins. Upregulated
  proteins are shown as red dots and downregulated as blue dots. The gray dots represent
  the proteins with unaltered expression. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis by the KEGG
  Mapper. Bar graph showing the KEGG categories enriched in DEPs from the proteomic
  analysis. The category “Metabolic pathways” included 15 DEPs, representing 15% of
  the DEPs identified. (C) Functional KEGG categories enriched in proteins affected
  by AKR1B1 overexpression. Heatmap showing selected functional categories defined
  using the KEGG mapper tool containing more than four DEPs. The color code indicates
  relative fold expression expressed as log2 FC, comparing 4T1-AKR1B1 with 4T1 GFP
  cells. The numbers correspond to the log2 FC of each DEP. (D) ROS levels decrease
  in 4T1-AK1B1 cells. 4T1-AKR1B1 or control cells were incubated with 5 µM 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
  diacetate for 45 min, and after washing, fluorescence was measured. Non-stained
  cell suspensions were used as blank. A two-tailed t-test was performed, ***p < 0.001.
  (E) A cluster related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain was defined
  by network analysis. The color code indicates relative fold expression expressed
  as log2 FC. Hexagons represent components of the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain. The solid black lines indicate functional and/or physical interaction defined
  by the software.
