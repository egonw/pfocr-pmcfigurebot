caption: 'Immunohistochemical staining of inflammatory markers and M1/M2 macrophage
  in different groups at month 4 post treatment. White arrow showed the positive area.
  (A) At month 10, the Mg group showed a significantly lower positive area of C/EBPα
  staining area than the Con group (p < 0.01). The C/EBPα positive area in the VIB
  group and the Mg + VIB group were lower than in the Con group, without significance.
  (B) CD206 positive areas in all treatment groups were significantly lower than in
  the Con group. (C) The F4/80 positive area showed no significant changes among all
  groups. (D) VIB, Mg and Mg + VIB groups showed significantly lower LYVE1 positive
  areas than the Con group at month 10. (E) PAX7-positive cell numbers in the VIB
  and Mg groups were significantly higher than in the Con group. (F) Quantification
  results of C/EBPα, CD206, F4/80, LYVE1 positive area and PAX7-positive cell number.
  Scale Bar: 10 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and **** p < 0.0001, n = 5–10.'
