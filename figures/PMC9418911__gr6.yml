caption: Cell-cell communication among cell-type enriched spots, see also (A) Heatmap
  showing differential interaction strength between cell-type enriched spots. Outgoing
  signals were shown in rows, while incoming signals were shown in columns. Increased
  (or decreased) signals in the re-challenged mouse compared to the immunized mouse
  were represented using red (or blue) in the color bar. The sum of values within
  the same column was summarized using the colored bar plot on the top. The sum of
  values within the same row was summarized using the colored bar plot on the right.(B)
  Bar plots showing overall information flow of each signaling pathway. Relative information
  flow was shown in the stacked bar plot, while raw information flow was shown in
  the regular bar plot. Enriched signaling pathways were colored in red or cyan.(C)
  Th17 enriched spots in the re-challenged mouse were the receivers of the IL6 signaling
  pathway. (i) Circle plot visualizing the inferred communication network of the IL6
  signaling pathway in the re-challenged mouse. The network of the IL6 signaling pathway
  in the immunized mouse was not significant. Circle sizes represented the number
  of spots in each group. Edge colors were consistent with the senders of the signal
  (sources), and edge weights represented the interaction strength. (ii) Violin plot
  visualizing the expression of genes related to IL6 signaling pathway in cell-type
  enriched spots from the re-challenged mouse. Gene expression from slice A3 was colored
  in red, and that from slice A4 was colored in cyan. (iii-iv) Peaks in genomic regions
  around Il6 and Il6ra in scATAC-seq data.(D) Th17 enriched spots in the re-challenged
  mouse were the receivers of the TGF-β signaling pathway. (i) Circle plot visualizing
  the inferred communication network of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the re-challenged
  mouse. The network of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the immunized mouse was also
  significant but not shown. Circle sizes represented the number of spots in each
  group. Edge colors were consistent with the senders of the signal (sources), and
  edge weights represented the interaction strength. (ii) Violin plot visualizing
  the expression of genes related to TGF-β signaling pathway in cell-type enriched
  spots from the re-challenged mouse. Gene expression from slice A3 was colored in
  red, and that from slice A4 was colored in cyan. (iii-v) Peaks in genomic regions
  around Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, and Acvr1b in scATAC-seq data.
