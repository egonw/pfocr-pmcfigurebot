caption: IRF2a targeted STAT1a to negatively regulate the JAK-STAT pathway. (A and
  B) IRF2a interaction with STAT1a depended on its IAD domain. HEK293 cells were cotransfected
  FLAG-STAT1a plus empty vector (EV), GFP-IRF2a (A), or truncated IRF2a mutants (B)
  for 24 h. Cells were collected for immunoprecipitation using α-GFP beads and analyzed
  by immunoblotting. (C and D) EPC cells were transfected with FLAG-STAT1a (1 μg)
  and GFP-IRF2a (0, 0.25, 1 μg). After 18 h, cells were treated with inhibitors for
  6 h (C) or stimulated with IFN-φ1 protein (100 ng/mL) for 20 min (D). Cell lysates
  were analyzed by immunoblotting with α-actin, α-FLAG, or α-GFP. (E and F) HEK293
  cells were transfected with different combinations of plasmids as indicated. At
  24 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG beads and analyzed by immunoblotting.
  (G and H) EPC cells were transfected with FLAG-STAT1a (1 μg) and MYC-IRF2a (0, 0.25,
  and 1 μg). After 24 h, cells were infected with SVCV (MOI = 1) (G) or transfected
  with poly(I:C) (5 μg/mL) (H). (I) Cellular localization of GFP-IRF2a (green) and
  FLAG-STAT1a (red). (J) The nucleus (blue) was stained with DAPI.
