caption: 'Expression of Atm, p-Atm, Chk2, and p-Chk2 in DSS-treated Ccndbp1-knockout
  mice. (A) Representative images of Atm expression in the colon of DSS-treated wild-type
  mice and Ccndbp1-knockout mice. Five different sections from each of the 5–6 mice
  in all groups were quantitatively analyzed for Atm expression assessment using ImageJ
  software for the entire colon and for the proximal or distal side of the colon.
  (B) Phospho-Atm (p-Atm), (C) Chk2, and (D) phospho-Chk2 (p-Chk2). Scale bar, 100
  µm. The values represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 5–6 mice per group),
  N.S., not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA with
  post hoc Tukey’s test. Each symbol represents the mean data of each mouse. P: proximal
  colon, D: distal colon, HPFs: high-power fields.'
