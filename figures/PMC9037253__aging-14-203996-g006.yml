caption: Xenograft experiments in female nude mice with circ_6014 knockdown. (A) Expression
  level of circ_6014 in stable circ_6014 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. (B) Photo of
  individual tumors. (C) The size of tumors of each group varied with time, and that
  of the experimental group was smaller. (D) The comparison of the tumor weight between
  the circ_6014 knockdown group and the negative control group and that of the experimental
  group was lighter. (E) The weight of the mice in the two groups varied with time.
  (F) The expression level of miR-885-3p increased in individual tumors of the stable
  circ_6014 knockdown mice compared with those of the negative control mice. (G) The
  expression level of NTRK2 decreased in individual tumors of the stable circ_6014
  knockdown mice compared with the negative control mice. (H) Protein levels of NTRK2,
  PIK3CA, p-AKT, and AKT in individual tumors of the stable circ_6014 knockdown or
  negative control mice. (I) Quantitative statistics of protein expression levels
  in the two groups of mice. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
