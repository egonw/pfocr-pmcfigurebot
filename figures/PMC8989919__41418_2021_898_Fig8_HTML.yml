figure_title: p53 physically interacts with Cdk1
caption: 'A Cartoon illustrating the BiFC principle. No fluorescent N- and C-terminal
  fragments of the GFP variant Venus are fused to p53 (VN-p53) and Cdk1 (VC-Cdk1).
  When both proteins are co-expressed inside the cells juxtaposes the Venus fragments
  resulting in structural complementation and green fluorescence. This technique enables
  the direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. B Scheme of the
  different p53-A protein versions generated for the BiFC analysis. Amino acid positions
  defining p53 domains are indicated: transactivation domain (TAD, in red), DNA-binding
  domain (DBD, in black), and oligomerization domain (OD, in white). C Third instar
  wing imaginal discs expressing only VC-Cdk1 or VN-p53-A under the sal-Gal4 driver
  did not show any BiFC signal (green). Topro-3 staining marks nuclei in blue. D BiFC
  analysis by the co-expression of VN-p53-A, VN-p53-AΔC, and VN-p53-AΔN with VC-Cdk1
  under the sal-Gal4 driver. Note that p53-A-VN and VC-Cdk1 induced a strong nuclear
  BiFC signal (green) and the induction of apoptosis (Dcp1, red). The expression of
  the C-terminal deletion, VN-p53-AΔC with VC-Cdk1 generates a cytoplasmic BiFC signal,
  but failed to induce cell death. In contrast, neither BiFC signal nor apoptosis
  was observed by the co-expression of VC-Cdk1 with the N-terminal deletion of p53-A
  (VN-p53-AΔN). A higher magnification of a region in the sal domain is presented.
  E Simplified representation of the DDR model. DNA damage triggers the key signal
  transducers ATR and ATM kinases that activate the downstream effectors Chk1 and
  Chk2. Chk1 stop cell cycle progression through the inactivation of Cdk1 and activates
  the DNA damage repair mechanisms. Chk2 induces the activation of p53, however, the
  proapoptotic activity of p53 is blocked in cell cycle arrested cells due to the
  presence of inactive Cdk1/CycB complexes. Some hours later, the G2/M blockage is
  progressively lifted and cells with unrepaired DNA are sent to apoptosis before
  entering mitosis through the activation of p53 by the ATM/Chk2 pathway and the presence
  of active Cdk1. Scale bar is 50 μm. See also Fig. .'
