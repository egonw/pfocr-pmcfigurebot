caption: LM1019-induced upregulation of proinflammatory gene expression and proteins
  and the signaling pathway for NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. mRNA expression
  levels of (a) iNOS and (b) COX-2 were quantified using qRT-PCR and normalized to
  β-actin expression (n = 2). (c) Protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 were evaluated
  by performing western blots using Jess™. (d) Activation of the MAPKs pathway by
  LM1019 was assessed by western blots using Jess™. Phosphorylated Erk1/2 and JNK
  were visualized to evaluate MAPK activation while the total Erk1/2 and JNK served
  as comparative controls. GAPDH was used as the loading control. (e) LM1019-induced
  translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus was monitored by immunofluorescent
  microscopy (Scale bar = 20 μm). Statistical significance was determined by * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to the control group.
