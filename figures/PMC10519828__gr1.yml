caption: Global metabolic profiling of Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ110) or untargeted
  control shRNA (shNT). Untargeted metabolomics was performed on triplicate biological
  samples of Par-C5 cells depleted of PKCδ (shδ110) or untargeted control shRNA (shNT).
  A, heat map with hierarchical clustering of the top 50 significant metabolites in
  Par-C5 shNT and shδ110 cells is shown following student’s t test analysis (α = 0.05).
  B, immunoblot showing the depletion of PKCδ with three different shRNA constructs.
  Densitometry quantifying the percent of PKCδ expression, as compared to shNT and
  normalized to actin, is shown below the blots. C, partial least squares discriminant
  analysis (PLS-DA) scores plot of metabolomics data. Shaded ovals represent 95% confidence
  intervals. D, enrichment analysis of shδ110 cells as compared to shNT cells. The
  top 26 metabolite groups from quantitative enrichment analysis are shown in the
  bar chart (p < 0.05). Enrichment ratio represents the number of observed metabolite
  hits divided by the number of expected metabolite hits within each pathway. PKCδ,
  protein kinase Cδ.
