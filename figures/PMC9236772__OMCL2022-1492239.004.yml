caption: Effects of TP on macrophages in Nrf2−/− mice. (a) Changes in the proportion
  of monocyte-derived macrophages (F4/80+CD11b+) in WT and Nrf2−/− mice administrated
  with TP for 14 days (n = 5). (b) Changes in the proportion of M2 macrophages (F4/80+CD206+)
  in WT and Nrf2−/− mice administrated with TP for 14 days (n = 5). (c) Changes in
  the proportion of M1 macrophages (F4/80+CD86+) in WT and Nrf2−/− mice administrated
  with TP for 14 days (n = 5). (d) Changes in the proportion of activated macrophages
  (F4/80+CD68+) in WT and Nrf2−/− mice administrated with TP for 14 days (n = 5).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM, ∗P < 0.05 vs. WT-TP.
