caption: TiPs promoted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro.
  (A) Electron micrographs and size analysis of the purchased TiPs. (B) Morphological
  characteristics of RAW264.7 cells after intervention with TiPs and RANKL. (C) TRAcP
  staining and quantitative analysis of the number of positive osteoclasts after intervention
  with TiPs. (D) F-actin staining and quantitative analysis of the area of positive
  osteoclasts after intervention with TiPs. (E) qRT-PCR results showing expression
  levels of MMP9, CTSK and Atp6v0d2 mRNA. (F) Scanning electron microscopy images
  of the bone resorption area after intervention with TiPs. Scale bar = 50 µm. The
  data were represented as mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.
