caption: Neoplasms expressing caspase 8 are sensitive towards the induction of extrinsic
  apoptosis by cytotoxic T-cells secreting TNFα, CD95L, or TRAIL. In addition, IFNγ
  is secreted, which may also sensitize tumor cells to ferroptosis via lipid remodeling.
  Evasion of extrinsic apoptosis via loss-of-function/expression of caspase 8 is commonly
  observed in neoplasms, yet it will render tumor cells more sensitive to induction
  of necroptosis, which, in turn, may lead to an inflammatory response via the release
  of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Finally, persistent selective pressure
  may result in downregulation/loss of necroptosis pathway components. Yet, this would
  leave IFNγ-induced sensitization towards ferroptosis intact. This figure was generated
