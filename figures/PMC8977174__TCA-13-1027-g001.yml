caption: ADAMDEC1 promotes the migration and invasion abilities of NSCLC cells. (a)
  Migration ability of HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cell lines transfected with indicated
  vectors, which consisting of the CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and shADAMDEC1
  groups were detected by wound healing assay. Quantification was performed to determine
  the migration distance. (b) Invasion assay was applied to compare the cell invasive
  capacity of CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and shADAMDEC1 groups in HCC827 and
  NCI‐H1299 cells. Quantification was performed to determine the invasion cells per
  field. **p < 0.01
article_title: Upregulation of ADAMDEC1 correlates with tumor progression and predicts
  poor prognosis in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
