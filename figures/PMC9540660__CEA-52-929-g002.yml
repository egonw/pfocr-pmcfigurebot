caption: Differentially expressed genes of PBMCs from birch‐allergic and non‐birch‐allergic
  subjects at baseline and six hours after Bet v 1 stimulation. (A) Study outline
  and graphical summary of the analysis pipeline. (B) Venn diagram representation
  to identify uniquely and shared DEGs between unstimulated non‐birch‐allergic (unstim‐NBA),
  unstimulated birch‐allergic (unstim‐BA), Bet v 1 non‐birch‐allergic (Bet v 1‐NBA)
  and Bet v 1 birch‐allergic (Bet v 1‐BA) conditions. (C) Significantly up‐ (green)
  and downregulated (red) genes between different conditions. (D) Fold change of shared
  genes between unstim‐BA vs. unstim‐NBA and Bet v 1‐BA vs. unstim‐BA. Red lines indicate
  changes from unique genes. (E) ClusterProfiler and ReactomePA was used to identify
  GO biological processes and (F) Reactome pathway enrichment of differently expressed
  genes
