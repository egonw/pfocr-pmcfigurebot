caption: 'Aberrant expression of TAL1 co-occurs with PI3K pathway mutations in T-cell
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. (A) Violin plots showing expression of TAL1,
  LMO2 and LMO1 in different T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient subgroups
  (Mullighan data set). (B) Distribution of hyperactivation of signaling pathways
  in TAL1 and non-TAL1 subgroups in two patient cohorts: (USA) Liu data set 87/264
  (33%) and (China) Chen data set 56/130 (43%). Using Fisherâ€™s exact test, P-values
  were calculated for testing significance of positive association between TAL1 subgroup
  and hyperactivation of different pathways. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis showing
  significant positive enrichment of PI3K pathway in TAL1 patients harboring PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathway mutation compared to TAL1 pathways without associated mutations.'
