caption: Schematic pathway showing significatively differentially produced proteins
  in clone 2 strain compared to WT strain in gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid
  cycle alongside WLP. Pathways were simplified to show only proteins of interest.
  Green arrows indicate protein overproduction and red arrows indicate underproduction
  in clone 2 strain compared to WT strain. The scores indicate the fold change values.
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; KGOR, 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PC,
  pyruvate carboxylase; PFOR, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PGI, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase.
