caption: 'AVA-NP-695 demonstrates superior anti-tumor efficacy and reduces metastasis
  in the 4T1 syngeneic model. (A) Tumor volume at given time points was measured with
  different concentrations of AVA-NP-695 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg) and anti-PD1
  and Olaparib and the growth kinetics of the mice after treatment (n = 8). All the
  animals were sacrificed on day 19. (B) Tumor volume at day 19 was plotted for the
  vehicle and 2 dose of AVA-NP-695 (3 and 6 mg/kg) (n = 8). (C) The metastatic lung
  nodules by 4T1 cells were visually counted for each animal of the respective group
  indicated in the graph and the average number of nodules is presented as mean ±
  SD (n = 8) after sacrificing the animals on day 19. (D) Histological analysis of
  lung metastasis of 4T1 tumors from various treatment groups were stained with hematoxylin
  and eosin. The percentage of metastasized area was calculated by considering the
  mean metastatic area of the vehicle group as 100%: [(metastatic area/mean metastatic
  area of vehicle) × 100)] (n = 8). (E–J) The mRNA expression levels of EMT markers
  and cytokines were quantified through real-time PCR in the animal tissue samples
  treated with AVA-NP-695 at 3 mg/kg (square) and 6 mg/kg (triangle) along with the
  vehicle control (circle). Tumor samples were analyzed for changes in mRNA levels
  of EMT markers (E) VIM, (F) N-CAD, (G) TWIST1, and (H) E-CAD and cytokines (I) IFN-Β
  and (J) CXCL-10 upon treatment. Ct values of markers were normalized with respective
  Ct values for GAPDH and fold change was plotted in comparison with the vehicle control.
  The p-values for all the treated groups were compared with the vehicle control group
  using ordinary one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. For comparison
  between two internal groups, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns: non-significant.'
