caption: The effect of γ-PGA on the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis
  of auxins. The maize roots were treated with γ-PGA, and the expression of genes
  related to auxin biosynthesis in the roots after treatment for 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h,
  24 h, 48 h, and 96 h. And the maize without treatment was used as the control. Expression
  levels of these genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, fold changes in transcripts
  were calculated by 2-ΔΔCt method with ZmTub as an internal control. And the heatmaps
  of these genes were made using the value of log2 (γ-PGA/control) of the relative
  expression level
article_title: Poly-γ-glutamic acid promoted maize root development by affecting auxin
  signaling pathway and the abundance and diversity of rhizosphere microbial community.
