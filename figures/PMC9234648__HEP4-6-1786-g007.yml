caption: ITGB8 overexpression promotes lenvatinib resistance in HCC cells through
  the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. (A) Phospho‐kinase antibody array blots
  using whole cell lysates of Ctrl shRNA and ITGB8 shRNA stably knockdown Hep3B_LR
  cells. Phospho‐AKT(Thr308), phospho‐AKT(Ser473), and phospho‐p53(S15/S46/S392) are
  marked in rectangles. (B) Western blot analysis of parental and LR cells for ITGB8,
  AKT, p‐AKT (Thr308), p‐AKT (Ser473), and GAPDH. (C) Western blot analysis of GFP
  control and ITGB‐overexpressing cells for ITGB8, AKT, p‐AKT (Thr308), p‐AKT (Ser473),
  and GAPDH. (D) Western blot analysis of Hep3B_LR cells treated MK‐2206 for AKT,
  p‐AKT (Thr308), p‐AKT (Ser473), and GAPDH. (E) Western blot analysis of Huh7_LR
  cells treated MK‐2206 for AKT, p‐AKT (Thr308), p‐AKT (Ser473), and GAPDH. (F, G)
  Cell viability was evaluated and qualified in Hep3B_LR cells co‐treated with MK‐2206
  and lenvatinib by SRB assay. (H, I) Cell viability was evaluated and qualified in
  Huh7_LR cells co‐treated with MK‐2206 and lenvatinib by SRB assay
