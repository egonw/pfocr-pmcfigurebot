caption: 'Effect of YOH on neointimal formation induced in mouse model of CCA ligation.
  (A) C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle or YOH (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 21 days after
  CCA ligation. The carotid arteries were harvested after 21 days. All CCA cross sections
  were stained with H&E; the representative patterns were obtained from five independent
  experiments. Arrowheads indicate elastic lamina, and the black bar indicates 100
  mm. (a) sham, (b) vehicle, (c) YOH (5mg/kg/d), (d) YOH 10 mg/kg/d; (e–h) magnified
  parts of (a–d); (B) Quantifications of mean intimal thickness and intimal–medial
  layer ratio. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 5 for each experimental
  group). *** p < 0.001 compared with the sham group; ###p < 0.001 compared with the
  injured group. (C) Schematic of the inhibitory mechanism of YOH in wild-type cells
  and VSMCs with α2B-adrenergic receptor knockdown. YOH inhibited PDGF-BB-induced
  proliferation by suppressing PLCγ1 phosphorylation but not ERK1/2, AKT, or p38.
  Similarly, YOH treatment still inhibited cell proliferation through PLCγ1 phosphorylation
  downregulation in PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs with α2B-adrenergic receptor knockdown.'
