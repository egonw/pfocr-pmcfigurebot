caption: Smad-independent signaling pathways. BMP signal transduction involves a number
  of ligands, type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and coreceptors,
  which regulate the activation of intracellular mediators in interactions with extracellular
  stimuli. Smad-independent signaling through phosphorylated TAK (pTAK), protein kinases
  A and C (PKA/C), and PI3K/Akt. Ligand binding induces the formation of the receptor
  complex. BMP receptors linked to the TAK1/TAB1 phosphorylate and activate the downstream
  MAPKs, including p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, respectively. Consequently, activation of
  these kinases leads to the phosphorylation of several transcriptional factors, activating
  the transcription of downstream target genes. In addition, PI3K/Akt and PKA/C are
  phosphorylated by BMP receptors. Then activated PI3K/Akt and PKA/C phosphorylate
  their downstream transcription factors. These activated transcription factors bind
  to their binding responsible elements in their target gene regulatory regions and
  upregulate the expression of DSPP and DMP1 genes and induce dental mesenchymal cell
  differentiation and dentin formation. Akt, (v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene)/PKB
