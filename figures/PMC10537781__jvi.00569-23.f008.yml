caption: The aa 1–102 of the ASFV I10L protein are essential for suppressing the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Schematic illustration of the truncated IKKβ
  mutants. (B) Schematic illustration of the truncated pI10L mutants. (C) The ASFV
  pI10L interacts with the kinase domain of IKKβ. The plasmids expressing the complete
  or truncated IKKβ were co-transfected with the pI10L-expressing plasmid for 24 hours,
  after which Flag-pI10L was used as a bait to perform co-IP and immunoblotting analysis.
  (D) The truncated pI10L containing aa 1–102 is essential for interacting with IKKβ.
  The plasmids expressing the complete or truncated pI10L were co-transfected with
  IKKβ for 24 hours, after which the complete and truncated Flag-pI10L were used as
  baits to perform co-IP and immunoblotting analysis. (E) The ASFV pI10L(aa1-102)
  is essential for inhibiting the TNF-α-triggered activation of the NF-κB promoter.
  HEK293T cells were transfected with pNF-κB-Fluc (0.1 µg), pRL-TK (0.01 µg), and
  the plasmids expressing the complete or truncated pI10L (0.04 µg) for 20 hours followed
  by luciferase assay. (F) The ASFV pI10L(aa1-102) dramatically reduces the TNF-α-triggered
  transcription of the CCL2, IL-8, and TNF-α genes. The PK-15 cell lines stably expressing
  the ASFV pI10L or pI10L(aa1-102) or harboring the empty vector were treated with
  TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 10 hours, and then total RNA was prepared
  for RT-qPCR analysis. (G) The ASFV pI10L(aa1-102) dramatically reduces the TNF-α-triggered
  phosphorylation of IκBα and p65. The PK-15 cells stably expressing the ASFV pI10L
  or pI10L(aa1-102) or harboring the empty vector were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL)
  for 5 or 10 minutes and then lysed for immunoblotting analysis. (H) The ASFV pI10L(aa1-102)
  inhibits the TNF-α-triggered nuclear translocation of p65. HEK293T cells were transfected
  with Vec or the pI10L- or pI10L(aa1-102)-expressing plasmid. After 20 hours, the
  cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 10 minutes and then fixed for immunostaining
  followed by confocal microscopy. Data shown are the mean ± SD from one representative
  experiment performed in triplicates. (E and F) ***P < 0.001 (unpaired t test). FL,
  full-length; LZ, leucine zipper domain; HLH, helix-ring-helix domain.
