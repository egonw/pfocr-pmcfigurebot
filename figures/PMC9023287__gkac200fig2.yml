caption: Design of Shifted Weighted Annotation Network (SWAN) pathway analysis tool
  and pan-cancer results. (A) A conceptual diagram of SWAN calculations. Raw data
  in this pan-cancer analysis is CNAs. Pathway networks are then built utilizing protein-protein
  interaction data and haploinsufficiency data. Sample network scores are compared
  to paired-shuffled control data. Details are found in SWAN documentation and Methods.
  (B) Plot of the number of pathways which are identified among 31 cancer types as
  elevated or suppressed relative to the sum of SWAN shifts. (C) Plot of the statistical
  enrichment of known OGs and TSGs on elevated or suppressed pathways in each of the
  26 QC-compatible tumor types studied.
