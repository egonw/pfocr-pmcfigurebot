caption: Effect of differential lipid molecule metabolic pathways in fresh and dried
  products of Crassostrea hongkongensis. Each bubble in the figure represented a metabolic
  channel, and its horizontal coordination and bubbles shall jointly indicate the
  influence of the corresponding metabolic pathway in the different lipid molecules
  of fresh and dried products of Crassostrea hongkongensis.
