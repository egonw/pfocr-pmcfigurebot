figure_title: Addition of BCG to human newborn cord blood in vitro induced changes
  in plasma sugar, amino acid, and lipid pathways
caption: (A) Human newborn cord blood was stimulated in vitro with vehicle control
  (saline) or BCG for 18 h. The extracellular fluid (90% plasma v/v) was collected
  by centrifugation for metabolomics analysis as described in STAR Methods. The principal-component
  analysis demonstrated a marked separation of metabolites between BCG-stimulated
  and vehicle-stimulated newborn samples, as indicated by the ellipses.(B) Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering revealed major differences between treatments. BCG stimulation
  of blood was associated with a reduction in many metabolites, especially in the
  lipid pathway. Each column represents individual samples; BCG-stim denotes BCG-stimulated
  blood; control denotes vehicle control.(C) Top 50 enrichment overview based on metabolite
  set enrichment analysis (MSEA; MetaboAnalyst) highlighted pathways that were prominently
  altered after BCG stimulation, including those relating to the glucose-alanine cycle,
  lactose, and sphingolipid metabolism. Fold enrichment was calculated by dividing
  the observed number of hits by the expected number of hits of the overrepresented
  pathway. MSEA calculates a hypergeometric test score employing a cumulative binomial
  distribution based on the probability of seeing at least a particular number of
  metabolites with the biological term of interest in a given compound list.(D) The
  volcano plot illustrated BCG-induced changes in metabolites as compared with vehicle
  control. Red color represents significant (p < 0.05), pink marginally significant
  (p < 0.1–p > 0.05), and gray non-significant lipids.
