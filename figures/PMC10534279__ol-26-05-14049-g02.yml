caption: GDF15-mediates Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. In the Smad pathways
  (left), GDF15 binding to TGFβRII activates ALK1/2/3/6 and ALK4/5/7, leading to the
  phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8. The phosphorylated Smads form complexes
  with Smad4 and thereby regulate gene transcription. In the non-Smad pathways (right),
  GDF15 exerts neuroprotective effects via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and promotes intestinal
  inflammation through the TAK-1/NF-κB pathway. In addition, GFRAL interacts with
  RET receptors after binding to GDF15 to initiate ERK, Akt and PLCγ phosphorylation
  which induces anorexia. GDF15 also interacts with the receptor ErbB2 to activate
  the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway and promote cancer cell proliferation. GDF15, growth differentiation
  factor 15; TGFβRII, type II transforming growth factor-β receptor; ALK, activin
  receptor-like kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; TAK-1, transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase-1; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-κB; GFRAL, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor α-like; RET, ret
  proto-oncogene; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase
  C γ; ErbB2, epidermal growth factor receptor 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; p, phosphorylation.
