caption: 'Confocal microscopy images showed that niacin treatment reduced lysosomal
  free cholesterol in oxLDL-treated LDLr−/− macrophages in a dose-dependent manner.
  Macrophages were incubated with oxLDL (60 µg/ml) in the presence of different NA
  concentrations (0.3 mmol/L to 10 mmol/L) for 48 h and labeled with filipin (free
  cholesterol, blue), Lamp1 antibody (Lysosomes, red), and Nile red (lipid droplet
  of cholesteryl ester, yellow). (A) Free cholesterol gradually decreased in oxLDL-containing
  macrophages as the NA concentration increased. In contrast, cholesteryl ester showed
  no change in oxLDL-treated macrophages (Bar, 5 µm). (B) Intensities from lysosomal
  free cholesterol stained by filipin. (C) Co-localization coefficient between filipin
  (free cholesterol) and Lamp1 (lysosomes). (D) Intensities of Nile red staining (cholesteryl
  ester). (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)NA:
  niacin; oxLDL: oxidized low-density lipoprotein; LDLr−/−: low-density lipoprotein
  receptor knock-out.*p < 0.05 versus oxLDL group (n = 6).'
