caption: a, Quantification of caspase 3/7 activation (left) and annexin V signal (right)
  in four independent HD-MSNs (HD43, HD40, HD47, HD45, n=10~18) transduced with shCtrl,
  shRCAN1, RCAN1, or shCalcineurin (shCaN). Cells were also treated with 10 μM of
  Cyclosporin A, a CaN inhibitor. b, Representative images (left) and quantification
  (right) of cells with HTT inclusion bodies (IBs) in three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43,
  HD.40, HD.47, n=3) transduced with shCtrl, shRCAN1, or shCaN. Cells were treated
  with 10 μM of Cyclosporin A, a CaN inhibitor. Cells were immunostained with anti-HTT
  and TUBB3 antibodies. An average of 117 cells of each were counted from three or
  more randomly chosen fields. Scale bars represent 20 μm. c-e, Analysis of ATAC-sequencing
  from four independent HD-MSNs (HD43, HD40, HD47, HD45, three replicates each) transduced
  with shCtrl (control), shRCAN1 (rescuing), or shCaN (detrimental). Heatmaps (c)
  of signal intensity in overlapping chromatin peaks of open DAR (FDR<0.05, FC≥1.5)
  in shRCAN1-HD-MSNs and closed DAR (FDR<0.05, FC≤−1.5) in shCaN-HD-MSNs compared
  to shCtrl-HD-MSNs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (d) and pathway enrichment analysis
  (e) of genes associated with open DARs in shRCAN1-HD-MSNs and closed DARs in shCaN-HD-MSNs
  in (c). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA in (a,b); ****p<0.0001,
  ***p<0.001, **p<0.01, *p<0.05, and mean±s.e.m. Each dot represents one individual’s
  reprogrammed HD-MSNs (a,b). The sample size (n) corresponds to the number of biological
  replicates (a,b).
