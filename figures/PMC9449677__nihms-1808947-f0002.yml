figure_title: Antitumor immune response of AZD1775 is mediated via the cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3
  pathway in SCLC
caption: (A) Quantification of cells containing micronuclei (MN) after 1 μM AZD1775
  treatment for 24 h. Bars represent mean ± SD of eight areas. Statistical significance
  was determined using Student’s t test (***p < 0.001).(B) Western blots showing the
  protein expression of STING pathway, phospho (p)- and total (t)-STING, p- and t-TBK1,
  p- and t-IRF3, cGAS, and actin (loading control) in SCLC cells treated with 1 μM
  AZD1775 for 8, 24, and 48 h.(C) Quantitative mRNA expression of IFN-α, IFN-β after
  treatment with 1 μM AZD1775 for 48 h in SCLC cells (H526, H82, H446, RPP, and RPM).
  Bars represent mean ± SD of triplicate. Statistical significance was determined
  using Student’s t test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).(D and E) Quantitative mRNA expression
  of (D) CXCL10 and (E) CCL5 after treatment with 1 μM AZD1775 for 48 h in SCLC cells
  (H526, H82, H446, RPP, and RPM). Bars represent mean ± SD of triplicate. Statistical
  significance was determined using Student’s t test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).See
