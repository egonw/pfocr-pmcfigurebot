caption: GO and KEGG terms for differentially expressed mRNAs. (A) The main biological
  processes (BP), cell composition (CC) and molecular function (MF) of differentially
  expressed mRNAs enrichment. (B) The KEGG pathway of differentially expressed mRNAs
  enrichment. The larger the dot, the more mRNAs involved in the pathway. The redder
  the color, the more significant. (C) The results of GSEA for mRNAs in CSF relative
  to controls. Adjusted P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. CSF coronary
  slow flow, NC healthy controls.
