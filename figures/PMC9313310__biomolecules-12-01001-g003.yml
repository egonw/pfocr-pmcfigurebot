caption: Structure of Amyloid-β monomer, oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. (A)
  The primary amino acid sequence of the Aβ isoform. (B) The structure of amyloid
  beta peptide in which an alpha-helical structure is apparent. (C) Solution structure
  of amyloid beta in which two-thirds of the peptide form an alpha-helix conformation.
  (D) Amyloid beta peptide forming a collapsed coil structure entailing a series of
  loops, strands, and turns with no alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure. (E) The
  proposed pathway of converting amyloid beta monomers to higher order oligomers,
  protofibrils, and fibrils. Adapted from [].
