caption: 'PERK knockdown alleviates MP infection-induced cytokine release, ROS production,
  and ER stress in A549 cells. (a) The PERK protein level was detected after shPERK
  lentivirus transduction. (b) TNF-α and IL-8 release. (c) Western blot assay was
  used to detect the cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB protein levels. (d) ROS production
  was measured by flow cytometry. (e) The PERK, eIF2α, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP protein
  levels were measured. (f) TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptotic cells. ×200.
  (g) The caspase 3, CHOP, and PERK levels were measured using immunofluorescence.
  ×200. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001
