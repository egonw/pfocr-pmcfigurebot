caption: NXPH4/NDUFA4L2 pathway is essential for GEM resistance of BC cells in vivo.
  (Aâ€“C) Subcutaneous implantation mouse models were established using parental or
  GEM-R BC cells transfected with lentivirus containing NXPH4 plasmid and siNXPH4
  and/or NDUFA4L2 plasmid. Growth curve (A), representative images (B), and tumor
  weight (C) of xenografts (n = 5) in the eight treatment groups for 36 days are shown.
  (D) IHC staining of NDUFA4L2 was performed in the tumor sections from mouse models
  that were established using parental or GEM-R BC cells transfected with lentivirus
  containing NXPH4 plasmid and siNXPH4. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. N.S.
  means the difference is not significant.
