caption: IL-6 / IL-21 -IL-23R- RORγt signaling pathway is elevated during RSV infection.
  IL-6 / IL-21 -IL-23R- RORγt signaling pathway is involved in regulating IL-17A in
  other models []. We thus detected this pathway in our study. A IL-6 levels in BALF.
  B IL-21 levels in BALF. C IL-23 levels in BALF. D Gene expression of IL-23R. E Gene
  expression of the transcription factor RORγt. Graphs are represented as the mean±s.e.m.
  Data are representative of two independent experiments performed on 6 animals per
  group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 shown comparing the RSV group with the
  control group
