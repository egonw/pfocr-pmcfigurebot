caption: GO and KEGG gene pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs identified using
  the ESTIMATE algorithm. (A) Circle graph of GO analysis of DEGs. The different colours
  on the right half of the circle graph represent different GO terms, and the shades
  of colour on the left half of the circle graph represent the log2(fold change) in
  gene expression. (B) Differential gene GO analysis clustering results. The middle
  circle represents the log2(fold change) change in expression. The different colours
  in the outer circle represent different GO terms. (C) KEGG pathway analysis circle
  diagram. Different colours represent different KEGG pathways. (D) Clustering results
  of KEGG pathway analysis. The different colours in the outer circles represent different
  KEGG pathways
