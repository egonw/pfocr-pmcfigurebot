caption: 'Analysis of the type-I interferon pathway after irradiation. (a) The cytosolic
  dsDNA concentration 24 h after the final irradiation. Tukey–Kramer’s HSD test was
  performed to compare the difference between 0 Gy (N = 7), 10 Gy (N = 7), 16 Gy (N
  = 8), and 8 Gy × 3 fr (N = 8). (b) The expression levels of proteins in the type-I
  interferon pathway 24 h after the final irradiation. Untrimmed data are provided
  in . (c) The IFN-β concentration in cell lysates 24 h after the final irradiation
  at 0 Gy (N = 3), 16 Gy (N = 4), and 8 Gy × 3 fr (N = 4). Dunnett’s test was performed
  to compare the difference in the expression level of IFN-β between 0 Gy vs. 16 Gy
  and 0 Gy vs. 8 Gy × 3 fr. Each error bar represents SE. *: p < 0.05. Abbreviation—fr:
  fraction.'
