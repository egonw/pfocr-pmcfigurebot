caption: Effect of AdoMet and miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a on Notch mRNA levels
  in CRC and TNBC cells. HCT-116 (A) and MDA-MB-468 (B) cells were transfected with
  miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a mimics (left) and inhibitors (right) in the presence
  or not (Control) of 500 μM AdoMet for 48 h. Total-RNA of HCT-116 and MDA-MB-468
  cells was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by qRT-PCR to analyze the transcriptional
  level of the predicted target. The graphs show the fold-change of Notch in the different
  experimental conditions normalized to GAPDH mRNA and compared to untreated cells.
  Data represent the average of three independent experiments. The means were compared
  using analysis of variance (ANOVA) plus Bonferroni’s t-test. Error bars show mean
  ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus control untreated cells.
