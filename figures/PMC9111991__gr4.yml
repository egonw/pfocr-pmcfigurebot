caption: TLR-7 stimulation is associated with robust interferon-α response in the
  nasal epithelium. Compared to vehicle-only controls, resiquimod was associated with
  a substantial increase in IFN-α in both pregnant and non-pregnant female rats, confirming
  stimulation of the TLR-7 pathway. Scatter plots showing significantly increased
  IFN-α (Α) in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats 2 h after intranasal resiquimod
  stimulation, but not IFN-β (Β). For the cytokine experiments (C), the scaled and
  centered data were plotted as a heatmap in which the different colors represent
  cytokine expression levels. IFN-γ was excluded from the heatmap analysis because
  of zero variance, and the other 9 cytokines were subjected to hierarchical clustering
  by Euclidean distance. There were no significant differences in cytokine expression
  levels between the two groups. Data were analyzed with either 2-way ANOVA or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  test and presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3–6 each); ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p ≤
  0.0001.
