caption: Anaerobic microbial degradation pathway of toluene. The first step in the
  catabolism of toluene is the addition of toluene to the double bond of fumarate
  to form benzylsuccinate by benzylsuccinate synthase (bss). Benzylsuccinate is then
  activated to CoA-thioester by a succinyl-CoA-dependent CoA-transferase, and benzylsuccinyl-CoA
  is then converted to succinyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA. Benzoyl-CoA reductase initiates
  the degradation of benzoyl-CoA, which is thereafter further oxidized via reductive
  ring cleavage to carbon dioxide [,].
