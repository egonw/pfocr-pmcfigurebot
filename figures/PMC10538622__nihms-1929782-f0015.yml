figure_title: Small molecules screening identified saracatinib as negative regulator
  of inflammatory signatures in PBMCs and atherosclerotic tissue
caption: A. Top 50 candidate small molecules predicted using 4,823 DEGs input gene
  set in LINCS-L1000CDS2 in healthy PBMCs, in response to atherosclerotic plasma.
  B. Top 50 candidate small molecules predicted using 277 inflammatory (GO:0006954)
  DEGs as gene set input in LINCS-L1000CDS2. C. Heatmap of phosphosite responses to
  selected candidate drugs across all immune cell types summarizing the signaling
  responses to atherosclerotic plasma alone (vehicle) or in combination with candidate
  small-molecules (1–8), n = 4 biologically independent samples/condition; males=2.
  D. t-statistics of cell-type-specific phosphorylation of all immune cells with positive
  values indicating up-regulation and negative values down-regulation. Plasma response
  is compared to no plasma treatment. Each small-molecule combined with plasma treatment
  is compared to plasma treatment alone. Points outside the grey box indicate significance
  (p < 0.05, df=6), n = 4/condition. E. Signaling pathway analysis of the DEGs downregulated
  by saracatinib in atherosclerotic tissue treated with atherosclerotic plasma alone
  (vehicle) or in combination with saracatinib. The combined score (c) was calculated
  from the p value (p) obtained using Fisher’s exact test. P < 0.05 was considered
  significant.
