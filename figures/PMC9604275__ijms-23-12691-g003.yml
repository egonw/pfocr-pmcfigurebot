caption: Heparanase overexpression increases podocyte autophagic salvage pathway early
  in response to Adriamycin. (a–c) RT-qPCR of BECN1, ATG5, and ATG12 mRNA levels in
  podocytes (solid blue bars–V control, solid orange bars-H control) at 0, 2, 8, and
  14 h after Adriamycin (ADR)-induced injury (light shaded bars). Values were normalized
  to B2M. Significant changes were observed at 2 h after injury. (d–g) V and H differentiated
  podocytes were treated with 0.5 µg/mL ADR ± 100 µg/mL SST0001 for 2 h. Whole cell
  lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for phosphorylated Beclin1
  at Thr119 (T119) or Atg12-Atg5. GAPDH was applied as a loading control. Quantification
  of P-Beclin1 (T119) (50 KDa) (e) and Atg12-Atg5 (60 KDa) (g) normalized to GAPDH.
  (d,f) Representative immunoblots of P-Beclin1 (T119) and Atg12-Atg5, respectively.
  Results are expressed as the means ± SEM, n = 3–6 independent experiments. * p ≤
  0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001.
