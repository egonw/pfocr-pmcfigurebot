caption: 'Apigenin ameliorates renal general appearance and pathological microstructures
  and urine protein levels in HUA mice. The histological appearance of the kidney
  (A). Kidney weight/body weight (B; KW/BW, mg/g, n = 10). Representative images of
  H&E staining (C; ×200, Scale bar: 100 μm) of the kidneys. Urine albumin levels (D;
  mg/L, n = 8). The relative levels of urinary albumin to CRE (E; n = 6). The representative
  images of Masson trichome staining and their analyses (F,G; ×200, Scale bar: 100
  μm, n = 6). The black arrow indicates that the renal tubular epithelial cells were
  hollowed out, edema. The black circle indicates renal interstitial hemorrhage. The
  blue color denotes collagen fibers in the kidney. ##p < 0.01 vs. the NC group. **
  p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 vs. the HC group.'
