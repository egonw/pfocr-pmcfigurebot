caption: Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed exosome-based proteins
  associated with BM in NSCLC and SCLC (BM_NSCLC_DEEPs and BM_SCLC_DEEPs). A Comparison
  between BM_NSCLC_DEEPs and BM_SCLC_DEEPs. B Heatmap indicated a few distinctive
  proteins expressed differently in BM patients in SCLC and NSCLC. C, D GO annotation
  analysis of the specific BM_NSCLC_DEEPs and BM_SCLC_DEEPs, respectively. E KEGG
  pathway analysis of the specific BM_NSCLC_DEEPs. F, G Proteinâ€‘protein interaction
  (PPI) network of the specific BM_NSCLC_DEEPs and BM_SCLC_DEEPs, respectively. Red
  and blue plots indicated upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively
