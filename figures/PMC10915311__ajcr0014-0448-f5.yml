caption: NTSR1 knockdown in pancreatic cancer decreased response toward NTS-affected
  motility. MIA PaCa-2 (A, upper) or KPC (A, lower) was transfected with shLuc or
  shNTSR1, and 48 h post transfection knockdown efficiency was assayed (A). Cells
  from above conditions were then assayed for NTS-affected migration (B, MIA PaCa-2;
  D, KPC) and invasion (C, MIA PaCa-2; E, KPC). *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001.

  and gemcitabine resistance via the NTSR1/Akt pathway.
