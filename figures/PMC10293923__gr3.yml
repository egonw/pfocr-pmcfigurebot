caption: The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway for P. megaterium strain MARUCO02 genome.
  The pathway was reconstructed by combining antiSMASH BGC analysis with manual protein
  functional annotation and confirmation with databases (NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blastp)
  and UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/blast)). Genes encoding the respective enzymes
  are represented in black bolded letters together with the accession numbers (blue
  bolded) of individual protein sequences manually sorted from PGAP annotation.

  isolated from marine mangrove-inhabited sediments of the Indian Ocean in the Bagamoyo
  Coast.
