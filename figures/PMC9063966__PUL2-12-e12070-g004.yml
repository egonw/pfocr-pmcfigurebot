caption: 'TPT reduces the expression of inflammatory infiltration and the activity
  of MPO. (a) BALF cell counts. (b) Neutrophils in the BALF were measured. (c) Lung
  permeability was evaluated through the BALF protein content. (d) MPO protein activity
  was measured. **p < 0.05: CLP group versus sham group. #p < 0.05: CLP + TPT group
  versus CLP group. &p < 0.05: CLP + PDTC group versus CLP group. BALF, bronchoalveolar
  lavage fluid; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PDTC, ammonium
  pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; TPT, topotecan.'
article_title: Topotecan reduces sepsis‐induced acute lung injury and decreases the
  inflammatory response via the inhibition of the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
