caption: RELA coordinately activates expression of the HBP. Scrambled (Scr) or RELA-directed
  siRNA was transfected into hSAECs. Cells were mock-infected or RSV-infected (MOI
  = 1, 24 h) and qRT-PCR performed. Data are presented as fold change untreated controls
  normalized to peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) (A) GFPT1 mRNA, (B) GFPT2 mRNA,
  (C) PGM3 mRNA, (D) UAP1 mRNA, (E) GNPNAT1 mRNA. **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05, by post-hoc
  Tukey comparison. (F) Expression of RSV N transcript. n.s., not significant.
