figure_title: Ad26.COV2.S vaccination increased signatures of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell
  in vaccinated hamsters
caption: (A) Sample-enrichment analysis (SLEA) of pathways of signatures of CD4, CD8,
  T regulatory cell (Tregs), T follicular helper cell (TFH) and T helper 1 (Th1) cell
  increased in vaccinated animals at 4 dpi (in pink and blue) compared to naïve and
  sham animals (in red and green). Heatmap presenting the SLEA z-score of each of
  these pathways. SLEA scores represent the mean expression of all significant genes
  within each pathway for each animal. An SLEA z-score greater than 0 corresponds
  to a pathway for which member genes are up-regulated, while an SLEA z-score inferior
  to 0 corresponds to a pathway with genes downregulated in that sample. Columns correspond
  to individual animals, and rows correspond to individual pathways scaled across
  all animals using the z-score R function. (B-C) Heatmaps of the leading genes of
  CD8+, CD4+, Tregs, and Th1 markers, increased at 4 dpi in vaccinated animals compared
  to naïve animals. Adjusted P-values (<0.05) were calculated by DEseq2 using Benjamini-Hochberg
  corrections of Wald test p-values. Columns correspond to individual animals, and
  rows correspond to individual genes normalized reads count scaled across all animals.
  (D-E) Matrix showing the Spearman correlations of CD4 T cell markers (D) and CD8
  T cell signature, Tregs signature, and STAT4 targets (E) at 4 dpi with viral loads
  in hamster’s lung and nares, and with neutralizing and binding antibody titers at
  weeks 2–4 in vaccinated hamsters. Negative correlations were shown in cyan, and
  positive correlations were shown in pink.
