  phenotypes of CRC cells
caption: 'HCT116 and SW480 cells were transfected with oe-TUG1 and treated with ERK1/2
  inhibitor SCH772984 or in combination. A Western blot assay of p-ERK and ERK protein
  levels in HCT116 and SW480 cells. B–D CCK-8, Transwell (200×) and Flow cytometric
  analyses for the viability (B) invasion (C) and apoptosis of HCT116 and SW480 cells
  (D). E Western blot assay for cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase-3 proteins in HCT116
  and SW480 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001, compared
  with HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with oe-NC + DMSO. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001,
  and ####p < 0.0001, compared with HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with oe-TUG1 + DMSO.
  The measurement data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The experiments
  were repeated three times independently. Multi-group comparison was conducted by
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.'
