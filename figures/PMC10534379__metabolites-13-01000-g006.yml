caption: Pathways associated with metabolites affected by radiation and inflammatory
  diseases. Overview of top metabolite sets enriched in inflammatory conditions (A)
  and after irradiation (B) according to the MataboAnalyst analysis. The higher the
  dot in Enrichment Ratio, the more metabolites were present in a given pathway. (C)
  Network of pathways associated with irradiation and inflammation-related metabolites
  (according to the Cytoscape analysis). ID—inflammatory diseases; AID—acute inflammatory
  diseases; CID—chronic inflammatory diseases; RT—radiotherapy.
