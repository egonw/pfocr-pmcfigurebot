caption: Effects of L-arginine (L-Arg, 1%) and L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME,
  18.5 mM) treatments on protein synthesis rate and phosphorylation of mTOR and protein
  S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K) in the breast and thigh muscles of broilers. (A) The protein
  synthesis rate in breast muscle; (B) the protein levels of total and phosphorylated
  mTOR in breast muscle; (C) the total and phosphorylated p70S6K in breast muscle;
  (D) the protein synthesis rate in thigh muscle; (E) the protein levels of total
  and phosphorylated mTOR in thigh muscle; (F) the total and phosphorylated p70S6K
  in thigh muscle. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6); ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
