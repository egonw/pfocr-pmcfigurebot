caption: SCC9-sphere exhibits inflated CSC-like properties. (a) The comparison of
  sphere formation ability between SCC9-sphere and SCC9 cell line. Scale bar, 100 μm.
  (b) Bar graph showed SCC9-sphere enhanced the sphere formation ability compare with
  the SCC9 cell line. (c) SOX2 and BMI1 protein levels in two groups. (d) Volcano
  plot of differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing results. (e, f) GSEA
  comparing the SCC9-sphere group with the SCC9 cell line group in TNFA and EMT signaling
  pathway. Nominal p values, false discovery rate (FDR), and normalized enrichment
  score (NES) were shown.
