caption: Enhancement of energy metabolism promotes rejuvenated phenotypes in aging
  NPCs induced by OSKM. (a–d) Expression levels of stress response genes in the p53
  pathway in 4F aging NPCs subjected to short‐term induction of OSKM in the presence
  of 3‐Br PA as determined by qPCR analysis. (e–g) Expression levels of senescence‐associated
  catabolism index MMP13, ADAMTS5, and anabolism index COL2 in 4F aging NPCs subjected
  to short‐term expression of OSKM in the presence of 3‐Br PA as determined by qPCR
  analysis. (h,i) Immunofluorescence and quantification of γH2AX level in 4F aging
  NPCs subjected to short‐term expression of OSKM in the presence of 3‐Br PA. Scale
  bar, 25 μm. (j,k) Immunofluorescence and quantification of H3K9me3 level in 4F aging
  NPCs subjected to short‐term expression of OSKM in the presence of 3‐Br PA. Scale
  bar, 25 μm. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 according to unpaired
  two‐sample Student's t‐test
