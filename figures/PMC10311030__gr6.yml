caption: Antagomir-18a-5p treated osteoblastic lesions caused by PCa bone metastasis.
  (A) Safety evaluation of the liver and kidney in normal nude mice treated with antagomir-18a-5p
  or PBS for 4 weeks, HE staining. (B) Schematic diagram of the antagomir-18a-5p in
  the treatment of PCa bone metastases in nude mice. (C–J) Tibia specimens of PCa
  bone metastasis nude mice model after treatment for 4 weeks (control represents
  PBS treatment, antagomir represents antagomir-18a-5p treatment). (C) PSA immunohistochemistry
  (NC represents normal tibia microenvironment; brown represents positive). (D) Representative
  3D-reconstruction images of tibia (red arrow indicates osteoblastic lesions). (E)
  The ultimate load changes. (F) Young's modulus change. (G) The BMD changes. (H)
  The BV/TV change. (I) HE, Sirius red (red represents bone) and Masson staining (blue
  represents bone). (J) TRAP staining (purple represents positive). The data are represented
  as mean ± SEM or SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns P > 0.05. The dotted
  green line indicates a range of 5%, which was considered to be normal.
