caption: ND5 m.13708G>A-H7 mtDNA profoundly alters metabolite and expression profile.
  (A) Cluster analysis from GSEA of RNAseq in mutant versus control cybrids using
  Cytoscape. Every node represents a significant pathway, with blue indicating up-regulation
  and red indicating down-regulation of the pathway in variant versus control. (B)
  Differential gene expression between mutant and control cybrids for the Reactome
  Collagen Formation pathway. Log fold change (LogFC) is colored blue–white–red, with
  blue indicating up-regulation and red indicating down-regulation of a gene in mutant
  cybrids compared to control. Adjusted (adj.) P values are colored white–yellow,
  with yellow indicating stronger significance. (C) Metabolic pathway analysis of
  global untargeted metabolomics using significantly (P < 0.05) altered metabolites
  between mutant and control cybrids. Size of the dots indicates pathway impact (x
  axis), and color (white–yellow–red) indicates P value, with red corresponding to
  higher significance. (D) FLIM of nuclear NADH in control and mutant cybrids. False-color
  coding of NADH lifetime, with blue indicating a longer NADH fluorescent lifetime
  and a more oxidized NAD+/NADH redox ratio and red indicating a shorter NADH fluorescent
  lifetime or more reduced redox ratio. Gray indicates nonnuclear autofluorescence.
  Quantification of the mean nuclear NADH lifetime revealed a more reduced redox ratio
  in mutant cybrids (n = 5, with five image sections and >25 nuclei/independent experiment,
  unpaired t test). (E) Selected histone modifications of histone 3 in control and
  mutant cybrids displayed as peptide abundance normalized to control (n = 6, 12,
  unpaired t test). Significances are indicated by stars, with * = P < 0.05, ** =
  P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001.
