caption: The influence of circ_6014 on its target gene NTRK2 and the downstream PIK3CA/AKT
  signaling pathway. (A, B) Relative expression of NTRK2 in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells transfected with siRNAs or circ_6014 plasmids. (C) Protein levels of NTRK2,
  PIK3CA, p-AKT, and AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells after decreasing or increasing the expression
  of circ_6014. (D, E) Quantitative statistics of protein expression levels in MDA-MB-231
  cells. (F) Protein levels of NTRK2, PIK3CA, p-AKT, and AKT in MCF-7 cells after
  decreasing or increasing the expression of circ_6014. (G, H) Quantitative statistics
  of protein expression levels in MCF-7 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
