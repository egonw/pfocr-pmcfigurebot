caption: SIRT6 regulates the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells by activating
  the NF-κB pathway. (A) Nuclear NF-κB p65 and cytoplasmic IκBα protein levels were
  detected by western blot analysis. (B) Nuclear NF-κB p65 expression was evaluated
  by immunofluorescence. (C) PANC-1 cells were treated with vector, SIRT6, and SIRT6
  + RANKL, and then nuclear NF-κB p65 and cytoplasmic IκBα protein levels were assessed
  by western blotting. (D) The viability of PANC-1 cells was evaluated by Cell Counting
  Kit-8 assay. (E) ROS level was detected by DCFH-DA method. (F) The expression levels
  of GPX4, SLC7A11, HK2 and LDHA were determined by western blotting. **P<0.01 vs.
  vector group and &P<0.05 vs. SIRT6 group. SIRT6, sirtuin6; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; HK, hexokinase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
