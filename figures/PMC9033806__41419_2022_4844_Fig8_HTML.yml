figure_title: A schematic model illustrates the potential mechanisms by which GXYLT1
  and GXYLT1S212* promote the metastasis of CRC
caption: GXYLT1 promoted CRC metastasis via the Notch and MAPK pathways, whereas GXYLT1S212*
  exhibited stronger metastasis-promoting ability mainly through activating the MAPK
  pathway.
