caption: Single-cell RNA-seq analysis to investigate the impact of cytokine storms
  on TEX in PBMC. (A) Overview of the cell clusters in PBMCs (n = 13) derived from
  across healthy people (n = 6), moderate (n = 4), and severe (n = 3) COVID-19 patients.
  (B) Dotplots show the expression level of canonical markers representing cell types
  in PBMC. Cell types and their corresponding genes are listed at the bottom. (C)
  UMAP plots of PBMC colored by cell type among three disease states (healthy control,
  moderate, and severe). Cell percentage comparisons of Macro_C1 (D) and plasma (E)
  in PBMC across healthy controls, moderate, and severe patients. Kruskal–Wallis H
  test. (F) Pathway and process enrichment analysis of the top 100 highly expressed
  genes in a subclass of macrophages (Macro_C1). UMAP plots of PBMCs colored by cytokine
  storm (G) and immune exhaustion (H) scores across three disease states. The scores
  are scaled to 0–1. (I) Log2-transformed frequency of interactions between cell types
  of PBMC. (J) Cell–cell interaction network shows the interaction frequencies between
  cell types of PBMC.
