caption: pIKKε directly interacts with pSTING.A–D, HEK293T cells were cotransfected
  with pIKKε-GFP and mCherry-pSTING (A and B), with pIKKε-Myc and pSTING-HA (C and
  D) for 48 h. The cells were harvested and subjected for co-IP and subsequent Western
  blot analysis. E, 3D4/21 cells were stimulated with or without 2′3′-cGAMP (2 μg/ml),
  and then endogenous interaction between pIKKε and pSTING was identified by co-IP
  using anti-STING antibody. F, the purified GST-pSTING and His-pIKKε were incubated
  and subjected to GST pulldown with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin, followed by Western
  blot analysis. G and H, HEK293T cells were transfected with mCherry-pTBK1 and GFP-pSTING
  for 48 h, followed by co-IP and Western blot analysis. I, 3D4/21 cells were stimulated
  with or without 2′3′-cGAMP (2 μg/ml), and then endogenous interaction between pSTING
  and pTBK1 was examined by co-IP using the TBK1 antibody. J, 3D4/21 cells in 24-well
  plates were cotransfected with mCherry-pIKKε/pTBK1 and GFP-pSTING for 24 h. Cells
  were fixed, stained, and examined for colocalization by confocal microscopy. K and
  L, 293T cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg GFP-STING, 0.5 μg TBK1-HA, and increasing
  amounts of pIKKε (0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg) for 48 h (K), with 0.5 μg GFP-STING, 0.5 μg
  mCherry-IKKε and increasing amounts of pTBK1 (0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg) for 48 h (L).
  The cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and anti-mCherry
  antibody, respectively, followed by Western blot analysis. co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation;
  GST, glutathione-S-transferase; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 93T cell line; pIKKε,
  porcine IKKε; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1.
