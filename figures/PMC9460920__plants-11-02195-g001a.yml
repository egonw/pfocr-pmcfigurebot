caption: Pathway analysis of Transcriptional effect of SSRE extract. (A) Cytotoxicity
  assay of Sarcopoterium spinosum L. with different cell lines. A20 mouse lymphoma
  (black), HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (blue), NB4 cells (green), and A549
  human lung cancer cells (red) were incubated with a range of concentrations of SSRE
  for 24 h, and an XTT assay was performed. (B) Comparative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  (GSEA) of extract effect on lung (A549) and Mouse Adipocyte (3T3) cell lines. In
  the middle, the number of common pathways that have been found in both cell lines
  after extract treatment has been described. (C) RNAseq-based protein-protein interaction
  networks of hub genes obtained from the STRING Database (interaction score > 0.9).
  (Isolated protein nodes were not depicted in Figure). The Intensity of nodes between
  genes represents the strength of the nodes and the interaction between proteins.
