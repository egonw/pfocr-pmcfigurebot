caption: 'Impaired LEFTY-NODAL Signaling Pathway in TKO hESCs. A Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) highlights the similarities between TKO day4 embryoids and mouse
  Tet-TKO E6.5 epiblasts. Genes upregulated in Tet-TKO E6.5 epiblasts are highly biased
  to be upregulated in TKO day4 embryoids; B Upregulated or downregulated genes between
  TKO day4 embryoids and mouse Tet-TKO E6.5 epiblasts by GSEA. LEFTY1, LEFTY2 and
  NANOG were highlighted by red box; C RNA-seq TPM of NODAL, LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 in
  each cell line; D Heat map showing DNA demethylation dynamics of NODAL, LEFTY1,
  LEFTY2 promoters in each sample, black boxes indicate the differential methylation
  level, * represent compared to WT_d4 group p < 0.05; E Analysis of the percentage
  of 5mC at the NODAL, LEFTY1, LEFTY2 promoters by Epimark in hESCs and day 4 embryoids
  upon hPGCs induction; n = 3 independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± s.d.
  Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t-test (two-sided): * represent
  compared to WT_d4 group p < 0.05. F RNA-seq counts of Nodal, Lefty1, Lefty2 in mice
  WT E6.25 epiblast and TKO E6.25 epiblast; G RNA-seq TPM of NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2 in
  hESC, WT day4 hPGCLCs and TKO day4 embryoids'
article_title: The balance between NANOG and SOX17 mediated by TET proteins regulates
  specification of human primordial germ cell fate.
