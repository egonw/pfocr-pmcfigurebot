caption: 'Kidney ex vivo perfusion activates mechanosensitive signaling pathways.
  a Experimental scheme of mouse kidney ex vivo perfusion. b Heatmap showing the log2FC
  values of MRTF transcriptional target genes in perfused versus control glomeruli.
  c Top enriched pathways of MRTF transcriptional target genes. d Experimental scheme
  of pig kidney ex vivo perfusion. e UMAP plot of annotated cell types from snRNA-seq
  of perfused and control pig kidney tissue. g Immunofluorescence staining against
  MEIS1 in the pig kidney cortex. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. G, glomerulus.
  Dashed lines indicate the area of glomerulus. Scale bar: 100 μm. f Dot plot displaying
  defining marker genes for each cell type. STROMA, stromal cells. h Heatmap showing
  z scores of mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators estimated by IPA. i Dot
  plot displaying MRTF transcriptional target genes significantly changed in perfused
  kidney tissue. Nonsignificant regulation or genes are shown in gray g, h'
