caption: 'The MEK inhibitor PD98059 partially inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration
  and invasion caused by downregulation of DDX3. (A) SW480 cells were treated with
  PD98059 in serial concentration gradient for 24 h, and the protein expressions of
  DDX3, p-Erk1/2, Erk1/2 and β-actin were detected by western blot (upper panel).
  The correlation between the protein expression of DDX3 and p-Erk1/2 and PD98059
  concentration is shown in lower panel. **P<0.01, ns P>0.05 via Pearson correlation
  test. (B) Growth curves of DDX3-NC group and DDX3-KD group treated with or without
  6.25 µmol/L PD98059 by CCK-8 assay in SW480 cells (upper panel) and HCT116 cells
  (lower panel). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 via Two-way ANOVA. (C) Cell colony of DDX3-NC
  group and DDX3-KD group treated with or without 6.25 µmol/L PD98059 by colony formation
  assay in SW480 cells (upper left panel) and HCT116 cells (upper right panel). The
  numbers of clones are analyzed in the lower panel. ***P<0.001 via Student''s t-test.
  (D) Migration and invasion assays in DDX3-NC group and DDX3-KD group treated with
  or without 6.25 µmol/L PD98059 in SW480 cells (upper left panel) and HCT116 cells
  (lower left panel). The relative cell numbers of migration and invasion are analyzed
  in the right panel. ***P<0.001 via Student''s t-test. All graphs are drawn from
  the mean ± SD of three independent replicates. Abbreviation: CRC, colorectal cancer;
  EV, empty vector; KD, knockdown; NC, negative control; OE, overexpression.'
