caption: p38 MAPK-p21Waf1/Cip1signaling pathway involved in bavachinin-induced G2/M
  cell cycle arrest. A549 cells were pre-treated with or without 10 μM of SB203508
  for 1 h before bavachinin incubation for 24 h. After treatment, (A) the protein
  expressions of p-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, p21Waf1/Cip1, and β-actin, and (B) the mRNA
  expressions of p21Waf1/Cip1, (C) the cell cycle distributions, and (D) the cell
  viability were determined. All results were triplicated and represented by the mean
  ± S.D. The statistically significant difference was labeled as * when p < 0.05 between
  the control and the experimental groups.
