caption: BBR induced NSCLC cell apoptosis via the activation of the ROS/ASK1/JNK pathway
  in vitro. (A) The A549 and PC9 cells were then treated with BBR (0, 40, and 80 μM)
  for 48 h, and the ROS levels in the A549 and PC9 cells were measured by flow cytometry.
  (B) The data from (A) were quantified. (C) Following a 1-h pretreatment with NAC
  (500 μM), the cells were treated for 48 h with 80 μM of BBR, and the ROS levels
  were then assessed by flow cytometry. (D) The data from (C) were quantified. (E)
  The cells were treated as described in (C), and the protein levels were then assessed
  by western blotting. (F) The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  for the three different experiments with triplicate sets in each assay. *P<0.05,
  and ***P<0.001. +, added with indicated agent; −, none. BBR, berberine; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1; JNK, c-jun-NH2-kinase; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer.
