caption: A model of desensitization of the insulin signaling pathway by angiotensin
  II (Ang II) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When adipose cells are stimulated with Ang II,
  the endogenous AT1R is activated, leading to PKCβ activation, which in turn interacts
  with the insulin receptor (IR) and phosphorylates it on serine (Ser) residues impairing
  insulin actions such as glucose uptake and regulation of lipolysis. Blue arrows
  indicate Ang II signaling pathways. Black arrows indicate insulin signaling pathways.
  Minus sign (−) means negative regulation of FoxO1 and AS160 pathways by Akt. Red
  lines indicate the effect of PKC inhibitors (BIM I and Gö6976) and AT1R antagonist
  (DuP 753). Red dashed arrow indicates that PKC-mediated Ser-phosphorylation regulates
  IR function. Figure created with BioRender.com.
