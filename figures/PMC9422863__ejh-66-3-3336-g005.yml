caption: Inhibition of APLN reduced migrative ability of esophageal cancer cells.
  TE-1 and ECA-109 cells were transfected with APLN siRNA to knockdown APLN, then
  seeded in Transwell chambers. After 24 h, migrated cells were stained and photographed
  under the microscope (A). Migrated cells were counted (B); *p<0.05 compared to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
