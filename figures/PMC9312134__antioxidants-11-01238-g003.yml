caption: 'L. plantarum MR1 modulated the metabolic patterns in Nile tilapia. (a) Identification
  of differentially biological processes percentage in the HC-treated fish compared
  with the NC-fed fish or in L. plantarum MR1-treated fish compared with the HC-treated
  fish by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. (b) Annotation
  of the identical significant altered metabolism pathway in the three groups. (c)
  Heat map of selected differentially changed metabolites involved in pyrimidine metabolism
  (#, NC v.s. HC; *, HC v.s. HCL, #, p < 0.05, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). (d) Histogram
  statistics of differential metabolites in the heat map. (e) The contents of serum
  uridine detection by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); n = 6 in NC
  and HC groups and n = 7 in HCL group. Statistics were analyzed by one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s adjustment and presented as mean ± SEM (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001).'
