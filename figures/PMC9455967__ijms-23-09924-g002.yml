caption: Untargeted metabolomics of D. melanogaster reared on a habanero-pepper diet.
  (a) 2-D principal component analysis score plot demonstrating statistical clustering
  of metabolites in response to habanero-pepper (green) and control (red) diet. (b)
  Volcano plot of metabolites with a fold-change threshold (x) 1.0 and t-test threshold
  (y) 0.1. The red circles represent features above the threshold. The further the
  position from the (0,0), the more significant the metabolite. (c) Heat map of the
  top 30 metabolites showing contrasting abundance between the two treatment diets.
  The red color represents upregulated metabolites and blue circles downregulated
  metabolites. (d) KEGG pathway enrichment comparison of significant metabolites found
  in Drosophila in response to a habanero-pepper diet. The y-axis indicates the term
  categories, the x-axis the rich factor, the size of the dot the number of metabolites
  found in one specific pathway, and the color of the dots the p-value of enrichment
  analysis.
