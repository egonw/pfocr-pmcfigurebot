caption: 'IL-32 induces oxidative stress via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling pathway.
  (A) The effects of NOD2 overexpression on cell viability were evaluated using the
  Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) The effects of NOD2 overexpression on LDH levels
  were evaluated using the LDH assay kit. The effects of NOD2 overexpression on the
  levels of (C) MDA, (D) SOD and (E) ROS were assessed using specific assay kits.
