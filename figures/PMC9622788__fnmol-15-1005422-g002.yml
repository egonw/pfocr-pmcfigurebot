caption: The pyroptosis involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI). After TBI occurs,
  the caspase-1 is mainly activated by NLRP3, AIM2, ASC, and other inflammasomes.
  The activated caspase-1 includes the IL-1β/18 lysed from the pro IL-1β, and the
  N-terminal segments of the GSDMD (GSDMD-NT) lysed from the Gasdermin D (GSDMD).
  The 2-BFI, JC124, Dex, ACE2, Artesunate, HIF-1α, and PGAM5 can alleviate the pyroptosis
  by inhibiting the inflammasomes. The VX765 can exert the neural protect function
  through the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. The Rhein, CORM-3, and H2 can inhibit the
  pyroptosis as well. The RS can activate the SIRT1 to inhibit the activation of NLRP3,
  thereby relieving the TBI. As the inhibitors of the Caspase-1, the Ac-YVAD-CMK and
  Ac-FLTD-CMK can inhibit the lysis of GSDMS and the oligomerization of ASC to alleviate
  the pyroptosis.
