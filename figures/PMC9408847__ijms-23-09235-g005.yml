caption: Diagram of intermittent hypoxia exposure. The mice in the control group received
  intranasal administration with normal saline seven times. They lived in normoxia
  conditions throughout the experiment. For the induction of allergic asthma, mice
  in the Dp group were sensitized intranasally using 50 Î¼g Dp extract, resuspended
  in PBS. Mice in the Dp+IH group received Dp administration and were, at the same
  time, exposed to IH for three days. Mice in the CTL+IH group were exposed to IH
  without Dp administration.
