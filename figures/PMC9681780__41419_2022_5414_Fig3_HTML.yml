figure_title: PRSS22 promotes BC cells migration and invasion
caption: A–D The overexpression efficiency and knockdown efficiency of PRSS22 in BC
  cells. E–H Transwell assays showed that overexpression of PRSS22 enhanced the migratory
  and invasive ability of BC cells, while knockdown of PRSS22 inhibited migratory
  and invasive capacity (Scale bars, 100 μm). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
  I Immunohistochemistry staining of PRSS22 in xenograft tumors (magnification ×200,
  Scale bars, 50 μm). J The xenograft tumors of LV-NC group displayed local invasion,
  with cancer cells invading into the surrounding muscle tissues (the black arrow),
  the tumors of LV-sh-PRSS22 group were well-encapsulated (HE magnification ×200,
  Scale bars, 50 μm). K The quantification of local invasion of xenograft tumors and
  associated statistical analyses. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant.
