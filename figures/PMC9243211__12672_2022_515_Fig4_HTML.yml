caption: 'Knockdown of CD155 enhances radiosensitivity of EC. A Colony formation analysis
  of Eca109 and Kyse510 cells stably expressing sh-CD155 or sh-NC after exposure to
  0, 3, 6, and 9 Gy of radiation. B Survival curves were obtained based on the clonal
  efficiency assay. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of independent experiments
  (n = 3). C D0, Dq, SERD0, and SERDq were calculated using the single-hit multitarget
  model. D, E Eca109, and Kyse510 cells expressing sh-NC or sh-CD155 were exposed
  to radiation, and cell viability was analyzed using the CCK8 assay. Left: CCK8 assay
  results; middle: statistical analysis of CCK8 assay; right: IR of cell viability
  was calculated and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). **** P < 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. F wound-scratch assays were imaged immediately after the initial scratch
  (T0) and 24 h later. G Quantification of the relative cell migration in the wound-scratch
  assay. H–L Tumors from different groups (sh-NC, sh-NC + R, sh-CD155, and sh-CD155 + R)
  were xenografted in nude mouse and collected 28 days later. H Tumor images. I Tumor
  growth curve in nude mice, p-values were calculated using a two-tailed unpaired
  test. J Tumor volumes were recorded every three days and are expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation (n = 5). K Tumor weight was measured in each case. L The IR on xenograft
  growth was calculated based on the tumor volume and shown as mean ± SD (n = 5).
