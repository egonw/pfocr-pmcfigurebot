caption: 'Endocrine profiles of castration‐ and abiraterone‐resistant tumours and
  hosts. (A) Overview of the classical and alternative steroid synthesis pathway from
  cholesterol to DHT. (B). Classical testosterone synthesis intermediates. Left: intratumoural
  levels of the CYP17A1 substrate pregnenolone, the CYP17A1 metabolites DHEA and the
  androgen testosterone in VCaP tumours and corresponding levels in corresponding
  H295R tumors for +ADR→ORx. Right: corresponding plasma levels of indicated steroids.
  (C) Steroidogenic enzymes expression. mRNA expression of CYP11A1, CYP17A1, AKR1C3,
  and HSD17B6 relative to the housekeeping gene PBGD in VCaP and corresponding H295R
  tumours. Differences between VCaP and H295R were calculated by 2ΔΔCT. (D) Serum
  levels of intermediates of the alternative steroid synthesis pathway. Steroids could
  not be detected in tumour homogenates (data not shown). (E) Plasma levels of the
  main rodent glucocorticoid corticosterone and the CYP17A1‐dependent 11‐deoxycortisol
  in castrate male mice at humane endpoint. Dots indicate each measurable datapoint.
  Unmeasurable samples (ct‐value >40 for qPCR or steroid below LOD) not shown in this
  graph. qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [Color figure can be viewed
