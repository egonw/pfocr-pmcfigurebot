caption: Co-expressed gene module functions and temporal responsesBubble plot showing
  the MSigDB gene sets associated with modules enriched in DEGs in both sexes. The
  size of the bubbles indicates the number of modules enriched in an MSigDB gene set,
  and the color denotes the sex. The modules and their hierarchy were shown on the
  right side of the plot and colored by sex. The asterisks and squares next to the
  MSigDB gene sets indicate the presence of correlation between at least one module
  among those associated with the corresponding MSigDB gene set and physiological
  traits (i.e., asterisks for viral load and squares for weight loss). Only the correlations
  with p value ≤ 0.05 and coefficient ≥ 0.5 were included. Detailed information can
  be found in . Detailed time-resolved development of the IFN signaling modules and
  the AHSP pathway modules for females and males can be found in  and , and in  and
  , respectively. Detailed information about key regulators in modules can be found
  in .
