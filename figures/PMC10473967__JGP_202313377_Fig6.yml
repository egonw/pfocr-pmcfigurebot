caption: Gene enrichment analysis based on RNA-seq data of replated (35 + 2 d) vs.
  non-replated control (37 d) hESC-CMs. hESC-CMs grown for 35 d on laminin-coated
  glass coverslips were detached, replated on laminin-coated glass coverslips, and
  grown for an additional 2 d. Gene expression was compared with 37-d-old controls
  (fold change cutoff 1.5; n = 3). (A and B) Enriched biological process categories
  related to (A) ECM and cell adhesion, and (B) muscle development and function as
  demonstrated by GO analysis of upregulated genes using the functional enrichment
  analysis web tool WebGestalt. Sorted by −log P value ranking (Fisher’s exact test)
  with P < 0.05 set as the threshold. (C) IPA (Qiagen) revealed canonical pathways
  involved in mechanosensation/-transduction. Integrin-, G-protein- and calcium-associated
  pathways are indicated with a threshold of P < 0.05. Significance values (P value
  of overlap) for canonical pathways are calculated by the right-tailed Fisher’s exact
  test; n = 3 culture dishes from three differentiations. Combinations of black-,
  white-, or gray-striped bars refer to the involvement of signaling in two of the
  pathway categories as indicated by the legend.
