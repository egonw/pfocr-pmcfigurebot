caption: 'The effects of tumor-derived exosomes in tumor progression. (A) Tumor-derived
  exosomes rich in protein (HSP90α/β,TGF-β1) transfer to adjacent cells to promote
  tumorigenesis through the immunosuppressive effects. Tumor-derived exosomes CMTM6
  induce polarization of M2-like macrophages through the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
  (B) Tumor-derived exosomes miRNA (miR-9, miR-23a) and protein (EGFR) raise the formation
  of new blood vessels during tumor progression via the autocrine VEGF/VEGFR pathway.
  (C) Tumor-derived exosomes miRNA (miR-29a-3p, miR-21, miR-1246), which can be transferred
  to recipient cells and increase the incidence of recurrence and metastasis of cancer
  by activating the STAT6, JNK, and ERK signaling pathways, respectively. (D) Tumor-derived
  exosomes miR-21 conveyed to parental cells can be attenuated by the inhibitor (GW4869)
  promoting chemoresistance. Tumor-derived exosomes miR-20a-5p transfer to adjacent
  cells leading to radiation tolerance. Back arrows: promotion; red “T” arrows: inhibition.'
