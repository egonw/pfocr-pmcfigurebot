caption: 'Pressure loading aggravates DNA damage in hepatocytes: (A) schematic diagram
  of the experimental apparatus for pressure and changes in pressure over time in
  the pressure loading device; (B) DNA damage in hepatocytes cultured for 48 h under
  different pressure levels (5, 20, 40 mmHg) was examined using the comet assay. OTM
  and tail DNA% were used to calculate the degree of DNA damage (scale bar, 200 µm).
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
