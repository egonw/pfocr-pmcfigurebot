caption: Effect of overexpression and downregulation of CRT overexpression on cell
  apoptosis in HCC cells treated with HDAC inhibitors. (A, B) shRNA-mediated knockdown
  of CRT enhances drug-resistance in HDAC inhibitor-treated cells than in HA22T parental
  cells. (Câ€“F) Overexpression of CRT overexpression enhances HDAC inhibitor-induced
  chemosensitivity in HDAC inhibitor-resistant cells than in parental cells. All protein
  samples are analyzed using western blotting. Protein expression is normalized to
  expression of GAPDH. *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p<0.001 compared with control group.

  pathway to enhance chemosensitivity in HDAC inhibitor-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells.
