caption: The role of hyperglycemia-induced Bmi1 expression under immunodeficient environment.
  (A) Experimental schema of generating the immunodeficient BALB/c nude mice model;
  and alterations in blood glucose levels after STZ treatment. (B) Representative
  pictures of the orthotopic tumors. (C) Changes in tumor volume and tumor weight
  in different groups. . (D) The lactic acid concentration and glucose concentration
  of tumor tissues from normal and diabetes animal models. (E) IHC staining to evaluate
  the ACLY, KAT4, H4ac, and Bmi1 protein level in euglycemia-NC and hyperglycemia-NC.
  (F) IHC staining to evaluate Bmi1, UPF1, and HK2 protein level in KD-Bmi1, NC, and
  OE-Bmi1 in the euglycemia model. (G) Schematic diagram showing the effect of the
  hyperglycemia-Bmi1-HK2 pathway on the Warburg effect and TME. Data presented in
  the graphs represented means ± standard deviation from 3 parallel experiments. ∗∗∗∗P < .0001;
  ∗∗∗P < .001; ∗∗P < .01; ∗P < .05.
