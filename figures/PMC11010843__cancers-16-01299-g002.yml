caption: (A). Cumulative immunohistochemistry staining highlights propensity for BRAF
  V600E mutation and CD68 cell surface marker within ECD. (B). Targeted molecular
  therapy was utilized most often within our cohort of patients. (C). Depiction of
  mutations observed within our cohort of ECD patients. MAP kinase pathway related
  mutations, specifically BRAFV600E, were most common. Sequencing data is limited
  within our cohort to four patients total, three of which had mutations identified,
  as depicted above.
