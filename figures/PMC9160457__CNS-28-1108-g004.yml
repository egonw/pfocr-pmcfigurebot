caption: 'Validation of PI3K/Akt/GSK‐3β signaling pathway in the cortex and hippocampus
  of C57 mice, KK‐Ay mice and KK‐Ay mice + dl‐PHPB via western blot. (A) Representative
  western blot images of PI3K, p‐Akt (S473), Akt, GSK3β(S9), GSK3β in the cortex and
  hippocampus. (B) Quantitative analysis of PI3K, p‐Akt (S473), Akt, GSK3β(S9), and
  GSK3β. Quantified results were normalized to β‐actin expression. Values were expressed
  as percentages compared with the C57 group (set to 100%). Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM and n = 5–6 mice per group. #p < 0.05 vs C57 group, ##p < 0.01 vs C57 group,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs KK‐Ay group'
