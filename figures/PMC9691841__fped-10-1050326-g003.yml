caption: Enrichment analysis for 22 common TFs and their targets. (A) Biological Process
  Pathways for 22 common TFs. Pathway terms were ranked according to their −log10
  (p value) values. The dot sizes were proportional to number of genes. (B) Top 10
  Biological Process Pathways for targets of 14 activated TFs (dataset I, dataset
  II, dataset III). All the targets and pathways were common in three datasets. Pathway
  terms were ranked according to their −log10 (p value) values. The dot sizes were
  proportional to number of genes. (C) Top 10 Biological Process Pathways for targets
  of 8 repressed TFs (dataset I, dataset II, dataset III). All the targets and pathways
  were common in three datasets. Pathway terms were ranked according to their −log10
  (p value) values. The dot sizes were proportional to number of genes.
