figure_title: Schematic diagram showing how METH exposure alters cytoplasm iron content,
  membrane DAT expression, and METH reward
caption: Briefly, METH exposure increases Clk1 expression, which subsequently decreases
  the iron exporter (FPN1) expression, causing an increase in cytoplasm iron content,
  and also increases lysosomal DAT degradation, causing a reduction in membrane DAT
  expression. Increased iron content may also facilitate DAT internalization. Accordingly,
  genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondria Clk1 causes a reduction
  in cytoplasm iron content and an increase in membrane DAT expression. Increased
  membrane DAT facilitates DA reuptake from extracellular space and decreases DA response
  to METH, producing a reduction in METH reward. Similarly, a pharmacological agent
  that removes excess cytoplasm iron (such as an iron chelator or FPN1 activator)
  or inhibits DAT internalization would be also effective in attenuation of METH reward
  and dependence.
