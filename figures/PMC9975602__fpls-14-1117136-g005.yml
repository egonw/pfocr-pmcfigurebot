caption: Differential expression of representative genes involved in molecular function
  in response to heat stress. (A) Transcription factors those are commonly up-regulated
  in leaf and ovule, and leaf and pollen. (B) Transcription factors those are commonly
  down-regulated in leaf and ovule, and leaf and pollen. (C) Relative expression of
  heat shock proteins (HSPs) in leaf, pollen, and ovule. The blue color indicates
  the DEGs are up-regulated and the pink color indicates DEGs are down-regulated.
  (D) Graphical representation of commonly expressed DEGs in leaf, pollen and ovule
  that are involved in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway.
