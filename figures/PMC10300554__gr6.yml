caption: Prioritization of new drug targets in AS(A) Overview of the modified Pi prioritization
  algorithm.(B) Inclusion of disease-specific datasets (AS) improves the Pi algorithm
  output relative to the original Pi algorithm (Original) and outperformance relative
  to Open Targets textMining and geneticAssociations. AUC, area under the curve.(C)
  Prioritized target pathways (FDR < 0.05) based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  using the top 1% prioritized genes. Dot size represents percentages of genes represented
  in that pathway.(D) Identification of pathway crosstalk; that is, a network of highly
  prioritized and interconnecting genes defined by KEGG interaction data, with nodes
  segmented by predictor/evidence types.(E) Table summarizing the prioritization and
  evidence information associated with pathway crosstalk genes. Colored boxes underneath
  each predictor type represent the datasets in support. Existing therapeutic targets
  are indicated for aAS and bother autoimmune conditions.See also .
