figure_title: The CD44-Ezrin-p38 pathway in collective detachment induced by TAMs
caption: 'A Activation of Ezrin and p38 after MCF7 cells co-cultured with THP-1-derived
  M2-like macrophages or CCL8 by a non-contact transwell system was determined by
  immunoblotting assay. The band intensities were analyzed by densitometry analysis.
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. B Knocking down of CD44 inhibited the activation of Ezrin
  and p38 induced by THP-1-derived M2-like macrophages or CCL8. The band intensities
  were analyzed by densitometry analysis. ***p < 0.001, ns: no significance. C Knocking
  down of Ezrin in primary BrCa cells inhibited collective dissemination induced by
  TAMs in 2D culture system. The primary BrCa cell clusters were transfected by si-Ezrin.
  TAMs were pre-stained with Vybrant CM-DiI (red). D The p38 inhibitor attenuated
  collective dissemination of primary BrCa cell clusters induced by TAMs. TAMs were
  prestained with Vybrant CM-DiI (red). E Knocking down of Ezrin inhibited phosphorylation
  of Cortactin and p38 triggered by CCL8. The band intensities were analyzed by densitometry
  analysis. ***p < 0.001, ns: no significance. F Knocking down of p38 repressed the
  phosphorylation of Cortactin induced by CCL8. The band intensities were analyzed
  by densitometry analysis. ***p < 0.001, ns: no significance. G Scheme summarizing
  the proposed mechanism by which MDM2-p53-p38 signaling pathway mediated the acquisition
  of CD44high state, which leading to cohesive detachment.'
