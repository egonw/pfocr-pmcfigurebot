caption: 'cGAS-STING pathway prevents tumor apoptosis while promotes tumor proliferation.
  (A, B) Represent results and quantification of apoptotic cells of NC, cGAS- or STING-knockout
  HeLa cells. (C, D) Representative scatter spots and quantification of apoptotic
  cells of NC and knockout MCF-7. (E, F) Representative scatter spots determining
  apoptotic cells in NC, cGAS- or STING-depleted PANC-1 cells (E), and the quantification
  of results showed at right (F). (G–J) Left panels: Flow cytometry analysis of EdU
  staining positive cells in NC and knockout groups after cultured in suspension for
  48 h (G, I). Right panels: Quantitative result of percentage of EdU staining cells
  in NC, cGAS- or STING-depleted cancer cells cultured in monolayer for 48 h (H, J).
  Data were represented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
