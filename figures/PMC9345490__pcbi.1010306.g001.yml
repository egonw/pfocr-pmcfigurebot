figure_title: Effect of noise in the Notch-Delta single cell model
caption: (a) Schematic of the Notch-Delta circuit. The Delta ligand of the Sender
  cell binds to the Notch transmembrane receptor of the Receiver cell. Upon binding,
  the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) translocates to the cell nucleus (pink shading),
  where it upregulates the expression of Notch while inhibiting the expression of
  Delta. (b) Phase diagram of the deterministic single cell model as a function of
  external Delta ligands (DEXT) and Notch receptors (NEXT). Color scale indicates
  the probability to attain a Receiver state. To estimate the Receiver state probability,
  n = 1000 independent trajectories starting from randomized initial conditions were
  solved for each (NEXT, DEXT) combination. In the white region where the red shifts
  to blue, the system is bistable and can be in either the Sender or Receiver state.
  (c) Pseudopotential landscape for a case of shot noise (σshot = 12, NEXT = 0, DEXT
  = 1500). Continuous and dashed black lines depict the nullclines of the corresponding
  deterministic model, while black starred dots highlight the stable fixed points
  of the corresponding deterministic model. Green starred points locate the minima
  of the landscape. (d) Heatmap showing the extension of the Sender and Receiver minima
  as a function of shot noise for (NEXT = 0, DEXT = 1500). The areas of the two states
  are defined as the regions where the pseudopotential is increased by at most a unit
  from its value in the minimum. (e) Comparison of the standard deviations of Notch
  and Delta with different shot noise levels (dashed pink, grey, blue, and green lines
  representing std. dev. of N and D for σshot = 1, 7, 13, and 20, respectively) against
  fluctuations in Gillespie simulations (purple bars), chemical terms in the Notch
  circuit (orange terms), and copy numbers of Notch and Delta (yellow bars). Chemical
  rate amplitudes and copy numbers are averaged over Sender and Receiver. For the
  Gillespie and shot noise simulations, the one cell sender has NEXT = 5000, DEXT
  = 0 while the Receiver cell has NEXT = 500, DEXT = 1500.
