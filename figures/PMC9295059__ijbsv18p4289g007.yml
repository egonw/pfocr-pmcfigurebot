caption: MEDAG mediates EMT through the AMPK pathway under HG conditions. (a) Protein
  levels of p-AMPK and AMPK after culture under normal glucose and HG conditions.
  (b) Protein levels of p-AMPK and AMPK in MEDAGKD and MEDAGOE cells in a normal glucose
  environment and a HG environment. (c) MEDAGKD cells were treated with the AMPK inhibitor
  CC (10 µM) for 24 h under HG conditions. EMT-related proteins were analyzed by Western
  blotting. (d) A CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the growth of MEDAGKD cells
  after CC treatment under HG conditions. (e, f) Cell migration and invasion after
  CC treatment in MEDAGKD cells under HG conditions. (g) Schematic diagram showing
  the mechanism by which MEDAG promotes BC progression in a HG environment. The values
  are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. the control group.
