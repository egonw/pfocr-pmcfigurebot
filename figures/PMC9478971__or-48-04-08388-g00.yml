caption: Functional role of RON in the migration and invasion of PCa cell lines. (A)
  Detection of siRNA-mediated knockdown of RON in PC3 and DU145 cells by western blotting
  and real-time PCR. (B) The expression of RON, E-cadherin and N-cadherin was determined
  by western blotting after RON knockdown and MSP (100 ng/ml) stimulation in PC3 and
  DU145 cells. (C and D) Transwell assays for the effects of RON silencing and MSP
  (100 ng/ml) on the migratory and invasive potentials of PC3 and DU145 cells. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001; NS, not significant.
