figure_title: TNC promoted stromal cells proliferation via STAT3 pathway
caption: In vivo, STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 were markedly increased after UUO, and TNC
  deletion significantly reduced the phospho-STAT3 levels (A). In cultured fibroblasts,
  exogenous TNC markedly increased the phosphorylation of STAT3, peaking at 45â€‰min
  (B, C). The effect of TNC on cell proliferation was blocked by the STAT3 inhibitor
  Stattic (D). STAT3 is a downstream target of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
  TNC also increased the phosphorylation of EGFR (E), and EGFR inhibitor reduced the
  cell number of TNC-induced fibroblasts proliferation (F).
