caption: OLA upregulated Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway in LPS-activated peritoneal
  macrophages. Murine cells were pretreated with OLA for 30 min, followed by LPS stimulation
  for 18 h. Nrf-2 and HO-1 protein levels were detected by Western blot. Densitometry
  was performed following normalization to the control (β-actin housekeeping gene).
  Data are represented as the means ± SEM (n = 6). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS−DMSO-treated
  cells.
