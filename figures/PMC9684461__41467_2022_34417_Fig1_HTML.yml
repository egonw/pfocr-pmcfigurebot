figure_title: Xrn1 contains two functional NLSs
caption: a Position of NLSs. NLS1, found by cNLSmapper–, is highlighted in red. Xrn1
  structure was modelled using SWISS-MODEL. Tail is indicated by a dashed box. The
  expected location of the unstructured C-terminal domain containing NLS2 is shown
  schematically as a grey ellipse. b Sequence conservation of NLS1 among different
  yeast species. The sequences of 11 yeast strains were compared by the online WebLogo
  (U. Berkeley). The height of each stack of letters represents the degree of sequence
  conservation, measured in bits. c Xrn1-GFP import kinetics. A standard import assay
  was performed, as described in Methods, using cells that co-expressed Pab1-RFP (served
  as positive control, see d) and Xrn1-GFP or its mutant derivatives, as indicated.
  Percentage of cells showing nuclear import was measured at the indicated time intervals
  after inactivation of protein export. n = >100 cells examined over 3 independent
  experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.) p-values of two-tailed
  t-tests between WT and each of the NLS-mutant are indicated as *** <0.001 for all
  the pairs. d Import of Pab1, used as a positive control. Error bars in c and d represent
  standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent assays. e–g Starvation-induced nuclear
  localization of the indicated fluorescent DFs is dependent on Xrn1 NLSs. The mean
  fluorescence intensity of the nucleus and whole cell of WT or NLS mutant cells expressing
  the indicated RFP fused DF were measured after 1 h starvation in medium lacking
  sugar and amino acids. Each box represents the 25th to 75th percentile of values,
  with the median noted by the horizontal bar. Whiskers terminate at maxima/minima
  or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away from the upper/lower quartile, whichever
  is closer. n = >300 cells examined over 3 independent experiments. The ratio between
  the nuclear and whole-cell fluorescence is shown as a boxplot. P value was calculated
  by Wilcoxon rank sum test. * - <0.05; **- <0.01; *** - >0.001; **** - <0.00001;
  ns – not significant.
