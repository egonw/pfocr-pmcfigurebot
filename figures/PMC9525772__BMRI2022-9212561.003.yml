caption: Molecular docking analysis between two key components of TJZYF and AKT1,
  VEGFA. (a) Docking studies of human AKT1 with quercetin and (b) stigmasterol. (c)
  Docking studies of human VEGFA with quercetin and (d) stigmasterol. The protein
  structures of AKT1 and VEGFA are shown as cyan and rosy cartoon, respectively. The
  green color indicates molecules. The residues involved in hydrogen bonding interaction
  (yellow dash lines) have been shown in sticks.
