caption: 'Inhibition of Notch4 is beneficial to the healing of diabetic ulcer. (a)
  Representative images of wound healing in different treatment groups. (b) Wound
  closure analyzed on days 3, 7, and 14 by Image J (n = 10). (c) The count of F4/80+
  cells in different groups. (d) The ratio of M1/M2 in different groups. (e) Relative
  expression of IL-6 MCP-1, iNOS, and TNF-α. (f) Relative expression of anti-inflammatory
  factors IL-4, CD206, ARG1, and IL-10. ∗p < 0.05 vs control group; ∗∗p < 0.01 vs
  control group; #p < 0.05 vs diabetic ulcer group; ##p < 0.01 vs diabetic ulcer group.'
