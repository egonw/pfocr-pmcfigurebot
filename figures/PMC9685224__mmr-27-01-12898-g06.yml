caption: Schematic diagram. Combination treatment of UA + DOX results in tumorigenesis
  inhibition, mediated by targeting Akt/Gsk3β signaling and activating tumor-suppressive
  Hippo signaling, thereby inducing degradation of p-Yap in CRC cells. Combination
  of UA + DOX therapy reduced proliferation and promoted apoptosis in CRC cells by
  activating Akt-mediated effects of the mitochondrial pathway. Following combined
  UA + DOX treatment, LY294002 further inhibited Akt activity activating Hippo signaling
  pathway. Mob1, MOB kinase activator 1; Mst, mammalian Ste20-like kinases; CTGF,
