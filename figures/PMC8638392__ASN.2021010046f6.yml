caption: Analysis of renal sodium transporter abundance in inducible and kidney tubule–specific
  HIF1α knockout mice under baseline conditions. Hif1αPAX8/LC1 knockout mice and their
  control littermates (Hif1αlox/lox) were housed in metabolic cages for 6 days with
  liberal access to food and water (n=5–10 per group). (A) The 24-hour urinary volume
  (left panel) and urinary sodium excretion (right panel). (B) Systolic (left panel)
  and diastolic (right panel) BP. (C) GFR. (D) Western blot analysis of renal sodium
  transporter abundance in renal cortex from Hif1αPAX8/LC1 knockout mice and their
  respective control mice. β-actin was used as a loading control. (E) Western blots
  were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are expressed as a percentage of
  control values (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from five animals in each group.
  Unpaired t test was used to compare control and HIF1α knockout mice in (A), (B),
  (C), and (E).
