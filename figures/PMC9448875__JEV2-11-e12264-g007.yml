caption: NOD1 activation by CRC‐EVs promotes in vitro CRC cell migration and in vivo
  colorectal liver metastasis. (a) Scheme of CM collected from EV‐activated macrophages
  in subsequent CRC cell migration analysis. (b) Wound‐healing and (c) transwell assays
  of MC38 cells in response to CM from WT‐BMDMs or NOD1–/–‐BMDMs incubated with EV‐MC38.
  Representative micrographs and relative migration rates are displayed; (n = 3).
  (d) Gene expression in THP‐1 cells of the EV‐HT29 group compared to that in the
  control group. Red dots, upregulated genes; blue dots, downregulated genes; grey
  dots, unchanged genes; (n = 3). (e) Relative IL‐6, CCL1 and CCL2 expression in THP‐1
  cells incubated with EV‐HT29 or EV‐MC38; (n = 3). (f) Relative IL‐6, CCL1 and CCL2
  levels in THP‐1 cells pre‐treated with ML130 (20 μM) and stimulated with EVs from
  HT29; (n = 3). (g) Schematic representation of the intra‐splenic colorectal metastasis
  model. EV‐MC38 (20 μg/100 μl of PBS) was injected intravenously (i.v.) into WT or
  NOD1–/– mice every other day. Intra‐splenic inoculation of MC38 cells (1 × 106/100 μl
  of PBS) and splenectomy was performed on day 20. Mice were euthanised on day 35.
  (h) Representative images of tumours in the liver. Red arrows indicate tumour lesions.
  Scale bar, 500 μm. (i) H&E staining of livers. Black arrows indicate tumour lesions.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. (j) Relative number of surface tumour lesions (n = 5, except WT
  (EV) and NOD1–/– (EV), in which n = 4). Student's t‐test was used to determine the
  significance level; mean; error bar, S.E.M. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
