caption: Omentum‐derived adipocytes promote cell motility and activate the SIK2/MYLK/MYL2
  pathway. (A) A schematic diagram showing the steps involved in the isolation of
  adipocytes from the omentum of patients with benign ovarian tumours. (B) SKOV3 and
  OVCAR8 cells were cultured alone or with adipocytes in the upper chamber, and then
  transwell assays were performed with or without Matrigel to assess cell migration
  and invasion capability. The representative images are shown on the left panel,
  and the quantitative analysis are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  Statistical values were calculated by Student t‐test (unpaired two‐tailed). (C)
  SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells were cultured alone or with adipocytes for 12 h, and then
  the cell lysates were used for immunoblot analysis of the indicated proteins. All
  the experiments were repeated thrice independently. Bar plots represent the means ± SD
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
