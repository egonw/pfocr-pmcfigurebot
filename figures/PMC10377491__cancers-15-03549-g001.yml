caption: The roles of biglycan in gastric tumor carcinogenesis. (A) Gastric cancer
  cell-derived biglycan enhances the transformation of mesenchymal cells into CAF-like
  cells, which activates TLR signaling. In turn, CAF-like cells secrete fibroblast
  activation protein (FAP), promoting gastric cancer migration, invasion, and EMT.
  FAP initiates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, increasing
  their biglycan expression. (B) Biglycan stimulates gastric cancer cell invasion
  and metastasis by activating FAK signaling via specific phosphorylation at Tyr576/577,
  Tyr925, and Tyr397. (C) Biglycan decreases PARP1 levels and caspase-3 cleavage with
  a concomitant upregulation of mesenchymal markers. (D) The SEMA3B-AS1/HMGB1/FBXW7
  signaling axis is downregulated in gastric cancer cells, which facilitates the peritoneal
  metastasis of gastric cancer by decreasing biglycan protein ubiquitination and concomitant
  degradation, leading to higher biglycan levels.
