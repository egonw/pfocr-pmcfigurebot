caption: The effects of EtOH conditioning on ethanol metabolism in HPNE and HPNE-KRAS
  cells. (A) Simplified depiction of the ethanol metabolic pathway. Metabolites are
  in black text; enzymes are in blue circles. (B) Measurement of acetaldehyde abundance
  with and without acute EtOH exposure for 1 h in both the parental- and EtOH-conditioned
  HPNE and HPNE-KRAS cell lines. Mean ± SEM; n = 3. (C) Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species
  (ROS) measurements by DCFDA staining for the indicated cell line and treatment condition.
  Mean ± SEM; n = 3. (D) Protein expression of ethanol breakdown metabolism enzymes
  detected by quantitative TMT labeled proteomics. Mean ± SEM; n = 3. p-values were
  determined by Student’s t-test.
