caption: Flowchart of exploring the mechanism of PH-WLZ in treating CHD. The active
  ingredients of PH-WLZ and their potential targets were predicted from different
  databases. The relevant targets of CHD were collected from four different databases.
  The intersections of the active ingredient targets and disease targets were regarded
  as common targets. The pivotal active ingredients were obtained through a common
  target-active ingredients network analysis. The overlapping pathways were obtained
  through pathway enrichment analysis of the disease targets and common targets. We
  used the CytoHubba plugin to select hub genes in the common targets. Finally, the
  pivotal active ingredients, overlapping pathways, and hub genes were analyzed to
  explore the mechanisms of PH-WLZ in treating CHD. The one-way arrow indicates the
  relationship of progressive research paths, and the two-way arrow indicates the
  relationship of intersections.
