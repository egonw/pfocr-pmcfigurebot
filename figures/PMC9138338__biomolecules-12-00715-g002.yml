caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of diols from other carbon sources in E. coli. The
  green areas represent EG biosynthesis from xylose, the blue areas represent the
  biosynthetic pathway of 1,3-PDO from glycerol, and the purple areas represent the
  metabolic pathway of 1,4-BDO from other carbon sources. The gray areas represent
  the carbon sources for diol biosynthesis, and the applications of diols, respectively.
