caption: Concentration gradient PC-induced relative protein levels of Nrf2 and Bach1
  in MODE-K cells. (a and c) Cells were treated with 5 μg/mL PC for 0, 3, 6, 12, and
  24 h. (b and d) Cells were treated with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μg/mL PC for 24 h. All
  tests were repeated at least three times. “∗” represents P < 0.05 compared with
  the control group, and “∗∗” represents P < 0.01 compared with the control group.
