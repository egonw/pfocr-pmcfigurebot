caption: Inhibition of CCR8 inactivates the MAPK/NF κB signaling pathway in Ang II-induced
  VSMCs. (A-E) The protein expression of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, JNK, p-JNK, p38 MAPK, p-P38,
  nuclear NF-κB/p65 and p-P65 in control, si-RNA and si-LRRK2 group were measured
  by western blot. “*” means compared with the untreated group at P<0.05, and “#”
  means compared with the control group at P<0.05. GAPDH was used as an invariant
  internal control for calculating protein fold-changes
