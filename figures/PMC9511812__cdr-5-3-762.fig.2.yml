caption: 'Role of Family HER Pathway in osteosarcoma chemotherapy resistance. (A)
  Cisplatin resistance is associated with HER2 overexpression, PI3K/AKT activation
  and promotion p21 nuclear exclusion, favoring cell cycle arrest and proliferation.
  (B) Anti-EGFR therapy such as cetuximab and gefitinib sensitized osteosarcoma cells
  to DOX and MTX. (C) Afatinib a pan-HER Family inhibitor have an inhibition effect
  in osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration an invasion. (D) Trastuzumab deruxtecan
  is an antibody-drug conjugated composed by anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody
  and a topoisomerase I inhibitor as cytotoxic drug, that is now been tasted in clinical
  trials. AKT: Protein kinase B; DOX: doxorubicin; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HER: human epidermal growth factor;
  MTX: methotrexate; PI3K/AKT: phosphoinositide 3-kinase.'
