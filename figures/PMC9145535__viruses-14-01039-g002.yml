caption: Effect of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on p53-regulated promoters. (A) PG13-Luc reporter
  plasmid, which includes p53 binding sites, was co-transfected with vectors expressing
  the indicated viral proteins into 293T cells. Luciferase activity was measured 48
  h after transfection and is shown relative to the luciferase activity in the vector-transfected
  sample. (B) Immunoblot analysis of the expression of 2xStrep-tagged viral proteins
  and p53 in 293T cells. Red arrows point at the coronavirus proteins. Black arrow
  indicates non-specific band. (C) p21 promoter luciferase plasmid and SARS-CoV-2
  factors were co-transfected into 293T cells and the luciferase activity was captured
  at 48 h post-transfection. (D) The same luciferase assay as described in panel C
  was performed, except the cells were also transfected with a V5-p53 expression plasmid.
  (E) The luciferase assay shown in panel A was repeated in HEK293 cells. (F) PG13-Luc
  reporter plasmid was co-transfected with nsp5 or its mutant into HEK293 cells, and
  luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection and is shown relative to
  the luciferase activity in the vector-transfected sample. (G) p21 promoter luciferase
  plasmid and nsp5 or its mutant were co-transfected into HEK293 cells, and the relative
  luciferase activity was measured at 48 h post-transfection. (H) RT-qPCR analysis
  of p21 gene expression in vector-, V5-p53-, and V5-p53/nsp5-2xStrep-transfected
  HEK293 cells. t test was performed between vector- and SARS-CoV-2 ORF-transfected
  samples (* p < 0.05).
