caption: 'Enhanced ROS levels in NSCLC cells induced by (+)-ABX treatment. A Detection
  of ROS levels in cells treated with (+)-ABX using the DCFH-DA method. B Assessment
  of changes in ROS levels in cells treated with (+)-ABX after NAC intervention using
  the DCFH-DA method. C Impact of NAC intervention on cell viability after treatment
  with (+)-ABX measured by the CCK-8 assay. D Expression changes of apoptosis and
  autophagy-related proteins in cells treated with (+)-ABX after NAC intervention
  using western blotting. E Quantification of data from (D). F Expression changes
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins in cells treated with (+)-ABX after NAC
  intervention using western blotting. G Quantification of data from (F). Data are
  presented as means ± SD. Statistical significance: * or △P < 0.05, ** or △△P < 0.01,
  and *** or △△△P < 0.001 compared with the control. Data were obtained from at least
  three independent experiments'
