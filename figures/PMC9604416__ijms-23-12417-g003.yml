caption: Enriched KEGG pathways in SW/SFW group. (A) Pathway functional enrichment
  of DEGs in SW/SFW group. X-axis represents the enrichment factor, while Y-axis indicates
  the enriched pathways. The color indicated the q-value; the blue color represented
  the lower value, while the white color indicated the higher value. In addition,
  the point size indicated the number of DEGs; bigger dots represented more genes.
  The greater the rich factor, the more significant enrichment. IL17 signaling pathway,
  alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, FoxO signaling pathway, p53 signaling
  pathway, and cell cycle (red boxes) were found to be enriched in the SW/SFW group.
  (B,C) Validations of the mRNA gene expression levels of two selected alanine and
  glutamate metabolism related genes (ass and cad) transcripts by real time qPCR.
  Results matched with the sequencing data. n = 5; mean Â± s.e., * indicated p < 0.05.
