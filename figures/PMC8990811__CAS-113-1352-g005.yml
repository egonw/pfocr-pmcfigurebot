caption: Defects in the STING/IRF1‐STAT1 pathway impair the irradiation (IR)‐induced
  immune response. We established STING, IFNAR1, STAT1, and IRF1 Knockout cells (STING‐,
  IFNAR1‐, STAT1‐,IRF1‐) and investigated their functions. (A) Workflow of the data
  analysis. (B) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of downregulated differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in WT and STING‐KO KYSE‐450 cells. (C) Protein expression analysis
  of WT and STING‐KO KYSE‐450 cells after exposure to IR at 30 Gy/10 fr or to no radiation.
  (D) HLA‐B, HLA‐DRB1, and PD‐L1 expression in non‐IR and IR (30 Gy/10 fr) WT and
  STING‐, IFNAR1‐, STAT1‐, and IRF1‐KO cells. Data analysis was undertaken with two
  biological replicates.TPM, transcripts per million
