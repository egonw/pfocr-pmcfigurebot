caption: The Nrf2/ERK signaling pathway is involved in mediating OI-driven neurogenesis.
  a Representative immunostaining images of DCX (green) and EDU (red) in the hippocampal
  DG region. b–d Quantification of EDU and DCX positively stained cells. e Representative
  TUNEL immunostaining images in the hippocampal DG region. f Statistics of TUNEL-positive
  cells. g Representative immunostaining images of DCX (green) and p-ERK (red) in
  the hippocampal DG region. h Quantification of DCX and p-ERK positively stained
  cells. i Immunofluorescence staining of p-ERK (red) and MAP2 (green) in primary
  neurons. j Quantification of integrated density of p-ERK in the primary neurons.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. n = 4. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
