caption: 'The synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol. A: Cholesterol synthesis. Fatty
  acid metabolites coenzyme A synthesizes isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate (DMAPP) in the mevalonate pathway. Geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), synthesized
  by the condensation of IPP and DMAPP, combines with IPP to synthesize farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) further. Bimolecular FPP is condensed into squalene to synthesize more cholesterol
  and is also converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) in the presence of
  a relevant enzyme. B: Cholesterol metabolism. There are four primary enzymes involved
  in the generation of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), including CYP46A1, cholesterol-25-hydroxylase
  (CH25H), CYP3A4, and CTP27A1. 25HC is produced mainly by CH25H and CYP3A4. In addition
  to producing some 25HC, CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 primarily generate 24HC and 27HC, respectively.
  25HC, 24HC, 27HC, and 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) are all liver X receptor
  (LXR) agonists, while 25HC3S converted from 25HC inhibits the expression of LXR.'
