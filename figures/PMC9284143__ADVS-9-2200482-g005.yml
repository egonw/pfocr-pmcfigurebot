caption: In vitro antitumor capacity of FHM nanoparticles. a) Cell viability of MDA‐MB‐231,
  CT26, and 4T1 tumor cells treated with FH nanoparticles, free MTX, or FHM nanoparticles
  with or without FMD pretreatment at MTX concentrations of 2, 4, 8, and 16 µg mL−1.
  Error bars represent ± s.d. (n = 3). b) Cell cycle analysis of MDA‐MB‐231 and CT26
  tumor cells treated with FH nanoparticles, free MTX, or FHM nanoparticles with or
  without FMD pretreatment at an MTX concentration of 16 µg mL−1. Error bars represent
  ± s.d. (n = 3). Significant differences were detected by one‐way ANOVA with Tukey's
  multiple comparisons test, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. c) Detection of 5‐MTHF, GMP,
  and AMP amounts in MDA‐MB‐231 cells treated with free MTX or FHM nanoparticle, with
  or without FMD treatment. Error bars represent ± s.d. (n = 3). Significant differences
  were detected by two‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001. d) The metabolic pathway of MTX, histidine, and glucose. MTX inhibits
  the activity of DHFR, which catalyzes the reduction of DHF to THF. The metabolism
  of histidine to amino acid glutamate requires histidase, FTCD, and others, leading
  to the increased consumption of THF. Glucose catabolism reduction contributes to
  cellular THF depletion by decreasing the de novo synthesis of serine, as the β‐carbon
  on serine can be transferred to THF by SHMT.
