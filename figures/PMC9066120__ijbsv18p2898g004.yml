caption: 'MHO7 induced the release of DAMPs from TNBC cells. (A) CRT translocation
  was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining after exposure to MHO7 or DOX (2 µM).
  Scale bars 25 µm. (B) Expression of CRT and HSP70 proteins in the cell cytosol and
  the cell membrane were measured by western blot under treatment with MHO7. (C) HMGB1
  exposure was detected by immunofluorescence staining after MHO7 or DOX (2 µM) treatment.
  Scale bars 50 µm. (D) ATP was detected in the cell supernatant of MDA -MB-231 and
  4T1 cells after MHO7 or DOX (2 µM) treatment for 24 h. *P <0.05; **P < 0.01; ns:
  no significance.'
