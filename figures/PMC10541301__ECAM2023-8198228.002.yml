caption: 'Anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts from Chrysanthemum zawadskii
  flowers. (a) Fresh and dried flowers of CZ were extracted using 99% ethanol (top
  panel) and percentage of yield extract (bottom panel) as indicated. (b) RAW 264.7
  cells were treated with the indicated amount of extract with or without 0.1 μg/ml
  of LPS for 24 h. The expression levels of mRNAs were analyzed using RT-PCR. β-Actin
  was detected as a control. (c) RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with extract in the
  presence or absence of 0.1 μg/ml of LPS for 24 h. Intracellular ROS levels were
  measured by DCA-DA assay. (d) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with the indicated amount
  of extract for 24 h, and MTT assay was performed. Results are presented as a percentage
  of the untreated control. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
  ∗P < 0.05 vs. control. #P < 0.05 vs. LPS treatment.'
