figure_title: MAPK signaling contributes to the direct cardiomyocyte protection of
  Dapa
caption: H9c2 cells were pretreated with Dapa, and were then stimulated with PA for
  24 h. Samples were isolated using TRIzol, and transcriptome sequencing was conducted.
  a PCA analysis of the sequencing results. b Venn diagram of differential genes in
  Ctrl VS PA, and PA VS PA + Dapa. c Panther pathway enrichment analysis of 70 intersecting
  genes. d PPI hub-proteins analysis of 70 intersecting genes. e TRRUST transcription
  analysis of 70 intersecting genes. Dotted lines represented P = 0.05. Black column
  showed significant changed items.
