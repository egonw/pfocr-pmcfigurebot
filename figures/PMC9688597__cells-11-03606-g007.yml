caption: The association of LTB4R with BAX, BCL2, CASP3, CCND1, CDK2, and CDK4. (Aâ€“F)
  The difference of BAX, BCL2, CASP3, CCND1, CDK2, and CDK4 scores defined by using
  ssGSEA between LTB4R high expressed group and LTB4R low expressed group. In addition,
  the association of LTB4R expression with BAX, BCL2, CASP3, CCND1, CDK2, and CDK4
  scores. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, * p < 0.05.
