caption: Diagrammatic representation of the effect of medicinal plants on the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme I renin-angiotensin system (ACE1 RAS) pathway. Renin is produced by the kidneys
  in response to low blood volume, low sodium, or high potassium levels. Renin's primary
  substrate is angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver. Renin catalyzes the
  cleavage of circulating angiotensinogen, resulting in angiotensin I. Angiotensin
  II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone and is involved in sodium retention.
  The retention of water and sodium causes an increase in blood volume and thus blood
  pressure. ACEIs such as medicinal plants inhibit the action of ACE, reducing the
  conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Muscle contraction around blood vessels
  is reduced, successfully dilating vessels, and lowering blood pressure. Aldosterone
  levels drop, as does water/sodium reabsorption, lowering blood pressure. Image created
