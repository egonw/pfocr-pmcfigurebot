caption: 'Evaluation of agomelatine effect on impaired sucrose intake of CMS rats.
  Sucrose intake was assessed after chronic treatment with agomelatine (dark blue
  bars) in control rats (No Stress/Vehicle) or exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS)
  (n = 10 for each experimental group). Data are expressed in grams (g) of sucrose
  solution taken by each individual animal in every experimental group. ** p < 0.01
  No Stress/Vehicle; ## p < 0.01 vs. Stress/Vehicle (two-way ANOVA with PLSD).'
