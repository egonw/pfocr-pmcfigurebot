caption: Effect of SLs on the LPS-induced levels of ROS and Ca2+ in RAW264.7 cells.
  Cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS with or without SL for 8 h. Flow cytometry
  was employed to determine the levels of (A) Ca2+ and (B) ROS. The results are presented
  as the mean ± standard error (n = 3), and a p-value less than 0.05 was expressed
  as statistically significant (###, p < 0.001 vs. blank group; **, ***, p < 0.01,
  0.001 vs. LPS treatment group).
