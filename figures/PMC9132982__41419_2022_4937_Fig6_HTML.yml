figure_title: Proguanil induces autophagy in BC cells
caption: A T24, J82 were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105/well). When the cell density
  reaches 70–80%, cells were treated with proguanil for 12 h, and the protein expressions
  of LC3 and Beclin-1 were detected by WB. B When the density of T24 and J82 reaches
  70–80% in 75 cm2 vented culture flasks, cells were treated with proguanil for 12 h.
  Subsequently, cells are then fixed with electron microscope fixative and observed
  under a transmission electron microscope (Red arrows indicate autophagosomes). C
  T24, J82 were plated on glass disks in 12-well plates (8.0 × 104 /well) and treated
  with proguanil for 12 h. Subsequently, cells washed with wash buffer and stained
  with MDC as described in “Materials and methods”, and then observed under an inverted
  fluorescence microscope. D T24, J82 were plated on glass disks in 12-well plates
  (2.0 × 104/well), After 24 h, cells were treated with proguanil for 12 h. The effect
  of proguanil on LC3 was detected by immunofluorescence. E T24, OE-T24 were plated
  in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 /well). When the cell density reaches 70–80%, cells
  were treated with proguanil for 12 h, the effect of proguanil on the expression
  of LC3 was detected by WB. F T24 were plated in 96-well plates (6.0 × 103/well)
  and pretreated with 400 nm AZD6244 for 12 h before exposure to increasing concentrations
  of proguanil for an additional 72 h, the combined effect of proguanil and AZD6244
  was detected by MTT assay. G Combination index (CI) among the combinations of two
  drugs was calculated using CompuSyn software. if CI > 1, it denotes antagonism;
  if CI < 1, it denotes synergism. CI values in all of combinations were less than
  1, indicating synergism. H T24 were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105/well). When
  the cell density reaches 70–80%, cells were pretreated with 400 nm AZD6244 for 12 h
  before exposure to proguanil for an additional 12 h, the protein expressions of
  p-ERK1/2 and LC3 were detected by WB. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. Error bars represent means ± SD from triplicate experiments. Vehicle
  control means the concentration of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ns not significant).
