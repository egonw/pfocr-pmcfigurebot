caption: The Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway. Nrf2, a transcription factor, contributes
  to expression of cell-protective genes in response to respiratory oxidative stress.
  Keap1 is a regulatory protein that inhibits activation of Nrf2. Under Constitutional
  condition, Nrf2 remains bound to Keap1 and is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway dependent on keap1. In respiratory oxidative stress environment, Keap1 is
  inactivated while Nrf2 is stabilized. The stabilized Nrf2 performs nuclear translocation
  and heterodimerizes with cMaf to activate target genes for cell protection through
  ARE. Nrf2 target genes include NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), heme oxygenase
  1 (HO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), glutamate-cysteine
  ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), and Multidrug resistance-associated
  protein (Mrp) and perform antioxidants, inhibition of inflammation, inhibition of
  apoptosis, Proteasome function, electrophile detoxication, and metabolism.
