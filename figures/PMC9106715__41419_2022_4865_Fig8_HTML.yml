figure_title: A working model displays the mechanism of which RP1-59D14.5-modulated
  PCa tumorigenesis and progression
caption: RP1-59D14.5 targets miR-147a/LATS1/2 axis as a ceRNA or recruits HUR to upregulate
  CK1 which could phosphorylate YAP and then recruit Î²TrCP to promote YAP degradation,
  consequently activating the Hippo signaling pathway in PCa cell.

  of prostate cancer via activation of the Hippo signaling pathway.
