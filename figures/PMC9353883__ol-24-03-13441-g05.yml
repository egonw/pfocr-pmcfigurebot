caption: Synergistic effect of phloretin on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis signaling in
  colon cancer cells. Combined treatment with phloretin and TRAIL acts on colon cancer
  cells by activating both the DR pathway and the stress pathway. The stress pathway
  is modulated by phloretin through suppression of Mcl-1 expression via proteasomal
  degradation, leading to increased expression of cleaved caspase-3. Cyt c, cytochrome
  c; DR, death receptor; Mcl-1, MCL1 apoptosis regulator BCL2 family member; MMP,
  mitochondrial membrane potential; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand; Ub, ubiquitin.
