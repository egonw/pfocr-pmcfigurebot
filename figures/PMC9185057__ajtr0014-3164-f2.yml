caption: 'Comparison of apoptosis between the groups. A: The apoptosis rate of HT22
  cells in the OGD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05).
  The apoptosis rate was significantly decreased after treatment with crocin. Specifically,
  the anti-apoptotic effect of crocin showed a dose-dependent manner. B: Control group.
  C: OGD group. D: Low dose group. E: Medium dose group. F: High dose group. Note:
  Compared with control group, *P<0.05; Compared with OGD group, #P<0.05; Compared
  with Low dose group, ΔP<0.05; Compared with Medium dose group, ○P<0.05.'
