caption: 'Metabolism and function of amino acids in osteoblast lineage cells. Scheme
  showing the main cellular processes (in green boxes) supported by amino acids in
  osteoblasts. Dotted lines indicate a pathway consisting of several reactions. Transporters
  or key enzymes are in italic. Transcription factors and signaling pathways that
  promote the expression of amino acid transporters are depicted in red. Abbreviations:
  αKG: α-ketoglutarate, ASL: argininosuccinate lyase, ASR: acute stress response,
  ASS: argininosuccinate synthase, ATF4: cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor
  ATF-4, (N)EAAs: (non-)essential amino acids, ETC: electron transport chain, GLS:
  glutaminase, GSH: glutathione, HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor, NOS: nitric oxide
  synthase, OB: osteoblast, Ocn: osteocalcin, PTH: parathyroid hormone, ROS: reactive
  oxygen species, TCA: tri-carboxylic acid cycle. Three-letter abbreviations are defined
  in .'
