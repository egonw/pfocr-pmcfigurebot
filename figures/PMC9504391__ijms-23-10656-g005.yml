caption: 'OsABT interacts with key factors of the ABA signaling pathway. (A) Yeast
  two hybrid (Y2H) assay of the interactions between OsABT and the three ABA signaling
  proteins OsABIL2, OsPYL4, and OsPYL10. GAL4 binding domain (BD) and GAL4 activation
  domain were co–transformed into yeast YRG2, and a series of 2 μL aliquots of the
  diluted (OD600 = 1, 0.1, 0.01) co–transformed YRG2 culture was spotted on SD/−Leu/−Trp/−Ura
  and SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His/−Ura media and incubated for 4 days. (B) Bimolecular fluorescence
  complementation (BiFC) assay of the interactions between OsABT and OsABIL2, OsPYL4,
  OsPYL10 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Scale bars: 50 μm.'
