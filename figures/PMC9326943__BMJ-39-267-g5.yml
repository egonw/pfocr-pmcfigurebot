caption: FLOT2 attenuated CC growth in vivo. (a) The tumor size, volume, and weight
  were suppressed after FLOT2 knockdown. (b) IHC staining was applied to measure the
  expressions of FLOT2 and Ki-67. The protein levels of FLOT2 and Ki-67 were reduced
  after FLOT2 knockdown. (c) Western blot analysis evaluated the expression of MEK/ERK1/2
  pathway-related proteins. The MEK/ERK1/2 pathway was retarded after FLOT2 knockdown.
  (d) Western blot analysis detected the expressions of AKT pathway-related proteins.
  The AKT pathway was retarded after FLOT2 knockdown. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001 compared with the siNC group
