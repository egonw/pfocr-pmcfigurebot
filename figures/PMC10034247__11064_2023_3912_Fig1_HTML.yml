caption: Roles of mast cells and Kv1.3-channels in the activation pathway of brain
  leukocytes (microglia or lymphocytes) and as the targets of commonly used drugs
  for COVID-related brain fog. Kv1.3-channels promote calcium influx and trigger the
  proliferation and activation of brain macrophages (microglia) or lymphocytes. The
  increased cytosolic calcium concentration stimulates the phosphatase calcineurin,
  which de-phosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), causing
  its accumulation in the nucleus and binding to the promoter region of cytokine-encoding
  genes. Antihistamines, statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics
  and anti-hypertensives, which inhibit Kv1.3-channels, or antihistamines, antibiotics
  and corticosteroids, which stabilize mast cells, directly or indirectly suppress
  the activity of brain leukocytes and the subsequent immunological response
