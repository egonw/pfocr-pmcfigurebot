caption: Identification of early events in the formation of colitis-associated colonic
  dysplasia. (A) Treatment regimen used to induce colitis-associated colorectal cancer
  in Swiss Webster mice. Animals were injected intraperitoneal once with azoxymethane
  (AOM, 7.4 mg/kg). Each treatment cycle consisted of 7 days of 4% DSS in the drinking
  water, followed by 14 days of untreated water. Animals were euthanized at the end
  of the last cycle (day 70). (B) miRs were profiled (FDR 3%) using the nCounter miRNA
  mouse assay (NanoString®). Red empty boxes—miRs validated by RT-qPCR; (C) Differentially
  expressed gene targets (n = 97) of the validated miRs that were subjected to in
  silico analyses (FDR 1%, p < 0.001); (D) Schema of the bioinformatics pipeline for
  pathway analysis, network interaction, and assessment of the biological impact of
  the miR signature. Data from in vivo studies (miRs and mRNA global expression) were
  subjected to bioinformatic analysis.
