caption: 'Specific endothelial S1pr2 loss-of-function enhances post-ischemic blood
  flow perfusion and angiogenesis in hindlimbs. A, Representative laser Doppler images
  show improved blood flow perfusion in S1pr2ECKO mice compared with WT control mice.
  B, Cumulative results for WT mice (n = 8) and S1pr2ECKO mice (n = 8) are shown as
  the ratio of blood flow in the ischemic limb to that in the non-ischemic limb at
  each time point. C-D, Representative images of isolectin-B4 staining of gastrocnemius
  muscles in WT and S1pr2ECKO mice after sham or HLI operation (C), with quantification
  of capillary density in gastrocnemius muscle after sham or HLI operation (D) (n
  = 6). E-F, Representative images of α-SMA staining of gastrocnemius muscles WT and
  S1pr2ECKO mice after sham or HLI operation (E), with quantification of arteriole
  density in gastrocnemius muscle (F) (n = 6). G-H, Representative images of H&E staining
  of gastrocnemius muscles in WT and S1pr2ECKO mice (G), with quantification of muscle
  fiber area after sham or HLI operation (H) (n = 5). I-J, Representative images of
  Sirius red-stained of gastrocnemius muscles in WT and S1pr2ECKO mice (I), with quantification
  of the percentage of fibrotic tissue in gastrocnemius muscles (J) (n = 5). K-M,
  Functional assessment of ischemic muscle over follow-up. Cumulative results for
  WT mice and S1pr2ECKO mice are shown graphically as Tarlov score (K), ischemia score
  (L), and ambulatory impairment score (M) (n = 8). Scale Bars: C and E, 50 μm; G
  and I, 100 μm. Data are mean ± SEM. n.s indicates not significant. *P < 0.05; **P
  < 0.01.'
