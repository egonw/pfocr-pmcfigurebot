caption: The cytotoxicity effect of CA was verified in FLS cells by (A) MTT assay
  with various concentrations of CA (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 µM), and (B) antioxidant
  capacity was checked after ROS induction in FLS by IL-1β and treatment with CA,
  10 to 200 μM. All experiments were conducted in triplicates and the data were expressed
  as mean ± S.D.
