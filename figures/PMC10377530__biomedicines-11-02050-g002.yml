caption: 'The impact of the CMA pathway on cancer and its prevention and treatment.
  CMA activity is altered by several factors (upregulation: starvation, hypoxia, oxidative
  stress, DNA damage; downregulation: age, nutrient richness), and it generally exhibits
  upregulated activity in tumor tissues. On the one hand, highly active CMA can promote
  tumor growth by degrading tumor suppressors and other factors. On the other hand,
  highly active CMA can inhibit tumor growth by degrading oncogenic factors, etc.
  Taking appropriate measures (such as maintaining protein homeostasis and so on)
  can prevent healthy cells from malignantly transforming into tumor cells. The dual
  effects of CMA on cancer were used to treat cancer tissue.'
