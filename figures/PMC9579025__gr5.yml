caption: Differential gene expression between L-DOPA WT vs 6-OHDA WT and L-DOPA iMSN-D2RKO
  vs 6-OHDA iMSN-D2RKO mice(A) Volcano plot based on the −log10 adjusted p value versus
  the log2FC of the DLS transcriptome (L-DOPA mice vs 6-OHDA mice in both genotypes).
  Cut-offs are shown as dotted lines (p-adj < 0.01) and log2FC ± 20%. The numbers
  in red refer to downregulated genes, the numbers in blue refer to up-regulated genes
  with respect to the 6-OHDA mice. The genes named in the volcano plot are the 5 common
  genes observed in 6-OHDA WT and iMSN-D2RKO mice following L-DOPA treatment. (B)
  Pie charts represent protein functionality analysis of DEGs for WT and iMSN-D2RKO
  mice after L-DOPA treatment. The most representative categories are shown in the
  legend.(C) KEGG pathway analysis showing the most enriched pathways respectively
  to the comparison of L-DOPA vs 6-OHDA mice of each genotype. KEGG p-value <0.05
  (shown as -Log10).(D) Three heat maps (sham, 6-OHDA, L-DOPA) representing differences
  in expression (z-score) between WT and iMSN-D2RKO mice of genes related to D2 pathway
  activation and several transcription factors.
