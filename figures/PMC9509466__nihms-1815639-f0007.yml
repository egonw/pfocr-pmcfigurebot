figure_title: Treatment of Salinomycin and Pyrvinium in Meta4 organoids
caption: (A) Schematic illustration of target molecules of Salinomycin and Pyrvinium
  in Wnt pathway created with BioRender.com. (B) Phase-contrast images of Meta4 organoids
  treated with DMSO vehicle, 1 μM of Salinomycin or 100 nM of Pyrvinium for 3 days.
  (C&D) Quantitation of diameters (C) or the number of surviving organoids (D) before
  and after the treatment. Mean ± SD (n=4). Each dot in C indicates an organoid diameter
  cumulated from four independent experiments. Paired t-test. **P < .01, ****P < .0001.
  (E, F and I) H&E (E), live/dead (Calcein AM/EthD-1) cell staining (F) or co-immunostaining
  for Trop2, Cttn, Ki67, Pcna, Cleaved caspase-3 (CC-3) or P120 (I) after the treatment.
  Dotted boxes depict enlarged area. (G-H) Quantitation of the number of live and
  dead cells (G) or non-DSCs and DSCs among live cells (H) after the drug treatment.
  Mean ± SD (n=3). Paired t-test. *P < .05. (J) Phase-contrast images of DP-DSCs isolated
  from Meta4 organoids 7 days after drug treatment and 7 days post drug withdrawal.
  (K) Quantitation of the number of surviving organoids after drug treatment and withdrawal.
  Mean ± SD (n=3).
