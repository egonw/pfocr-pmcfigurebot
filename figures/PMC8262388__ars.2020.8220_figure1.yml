caption: Impact of mtROS, ER stress, and Nrf2 deficiency on cardiometabolic health.
  Several studies have demonstrated that excessive mtROS contribute to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and to the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases that impact the cardiovascular
  system. In addition, abnormal activation of the UPR downstream of ER stress leads
  to the progression of obesity, diabetes, and CVD. Likewise, repressed activation
  of the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway leads to excessive oxidative damage in
  response to mitochondrial oxidative and ER stress, contributing to the pathophysiology
  of chronic diseases that negatively impact systemic metabolism and cardiovascular
  health. CVD, cardiovascular disease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mtROS, mitochondria-derived
  reactive oxygen species; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; UPR,
  unfolded protein response.
