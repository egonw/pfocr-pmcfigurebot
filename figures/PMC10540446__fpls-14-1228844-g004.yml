caption: 'Flow cytometry analysis of thyme cell nuclei, (A) peak1 and 2: diploid and
  standard. (B) peak1 and 2: standard and tetraploid plant) (C) peak1-3: diploid,
  standard and tetraploid plants, respectively in a mixoploid. Soybean Polanka variety
  (2C DNA = 2.50 pg) was used as standard. Peaks C.V. kept less than 5%.'
