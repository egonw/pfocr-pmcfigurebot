caption: 'Loss of VPS13C results in activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. (A) Cartoon
  schematic of cGAS-STING signaling pathway and STING trafficking through the Golgi
  to lysosomes for degradation. (B) qPCR of five ISG transcripts (IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG15,
  OASL, and STAT1) shows increased expression in VPS13CKO HeLa cells. n = 3 biological
  replicates. Created with BioRender.com. (C) qPCR of three ISG transcripts after
  treatment with siRNA against cGAS (top row) or STING (bottom row). n = 4 biological
  replicates. (D) IB showing efficiency of STING depletion after treatment with anti-STING
  siRNA. (E) IB showing increased levels of phosphorylated STING, TBK1, and IRF3,
  indicating activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Note that the upper band in lanes
  2 and 3 of the anti-STING blot corresponds to p-STING (lanes 2 and 3 of the p-STING
  blot). (F) Treatment of siRNA against cGAS significantly depletes cGAS and also
  returns p-STING to WT levels in the VPS13CKO clones. cGAS knockdown also causes
  an increase in total STING levels in both WT and VPS13CKO cells. (G and H) P-TBK1
  and p-STING are returned toward WT levels in VPS13CRescue clones (G), quantified
  in H. n = 3 biological replicates. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****,
  P < 0.0001. #, P < 0.05; ##, P < 0.01; ###, P < 0.001 in siCGAS or siSTING compared
