caption: Effect of sodium acetate (NaAc) on milk fat synthesis and mTORC1 activation
  after pretreated with rapamycin. HC11 cells used in this figure were pre-treated
  for 2 h with 50 nM rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) before incubation with 0.75 mM NaAc
  for 24 h. (A) Oil red O staining images of HC11 cells. Scale bars are 100 μm. TAG
  content in intracellular (B) and medium (C). (D) Relative mRNA expression abundance
  of genes related to milk fat synthesis. (E–H) Relative expression abundance of proteins
  related to milk fat synthesis and mTORC1 pathway. All data with error bars are averages
  ± SEM (n = 3). In histograms, no letter or the same letter above the bar graph indicates
  no significant difference (p > 0.05), and different letters indicate a significant
  difference (p < 0.05). Each small white dot represents a test value.
