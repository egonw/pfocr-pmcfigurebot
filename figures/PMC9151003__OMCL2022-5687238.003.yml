  in HALLMARK datasets in TCGA SARC cohort. (d) Gene set enrichment analysis of PTBP1-related
  signaling pathways in KEGG datasets in TCGA SARC cohort. (e) Correlation between
  the expression of PTBP1 and TGFB pathway genes in pan-cancer. (f) Correlation between
  the expression of PTBP1 and autophagy pathway genes in pan-cancer.
