caption: Quantitative PCR-based determination of the RNA steady state level in HTB75
  (a–e) and HTB161 (f–j) cell lines of members of the FZD, DKK or Wnt gene families
  at 6 h of treatment with niraparib, F7, or a combination of niraparib+F7 relative
  to control. Gene transcript values were determined by quantitative PCR as a difference
  between the target gene versus a reference gene (HPRT). Values were calculated relative
  to the average expression of target genes in treated versus control using the 2−ΔΔCt
  method. Control was the vehicle control (1.00% v/v methanol + 0.60% v/v DMSO). Error
  bars indicate ± S.E. (n = 3). Levels with different Upper case letters with the
  same font and style were significantly different from all combinations of pairs
  by Tukey-Kramer honest significant difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
