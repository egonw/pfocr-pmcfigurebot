caption: In vivo study of the effects of RARγ in the progression of OA in SD rat model.
  (a) Establishment of OA model and subsequent drug treatment in rats. Randomly divided
  into 7 groups with 3 rats in each group. 0.1 mL monosodium iodoacetate solution
  (30 mg/mL) or normal saline was injected into the joint cavity of rats. One week
  after injection, 0.1 mL of the indicated drug was injected into the joint cavity
  once a week for three weeks. The drug including CD437 (1 μm), LY2955303 (1 μm),
  TNF-α (60 ng/mL), and SH. (b) Representative rat joints were shown, a gross view
  (upper) of the knee joint after dissection, and HE (middle) and safranin-o/fast
  green (down) staining were used for pathological analysis. (c,d) The expression
  of RARγ in each group was analyzed by western blot. (e) Body weight statistics of
  rats in each group. (f) Knee joint swelling degree, measure knee joint diameter.
  (g) Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was measured. Data were mean ± SEM of three
  independent assays. Magnification in ×50. (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
