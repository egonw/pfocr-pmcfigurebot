caption: 'Transcriptional and phenotypic characteristics of HLA-DR +CD38+CD8 T cells
  during immunotherapy: (A) Flow cytometry analysis of molecules associated with T
  cell function. HLA-DR +CD38+ cells expression of Ki67, Gzmb, and CXCR3 at baseline,
  cycle 1, and cycle 2 of immunotherapy. Total CD8 T cells are shown as a control.
  Summary plots show MFI of these markers for each patient. (B) HLA-DR +CD38+CD8 T
  cells are phenotypically similar in patients with and without clinical benefit:
  HLA-DR +CD38+ cells expression of Ki67, Gzmb, and CXCR3 were measured at cycle 1
  in with or without clinical benefit. Plots show MFI of these parameters (n=21).
  (C) Pathways altered in HLA-DR +CD38+CD8 T cells after checkpoint blockade. Pathway
  analysis comparing baseline to either cycle 1 or cycle 2 cells was performed for
  each patient. The average of all patients for each pathway is plotted in order of
  the pathways most upregulated post-treatment. Highlighted in red are pathways within
  the top 100 related to cell cycle and blue pathways related to innate inflammation.
  Selected pathways are listed in plots. (D) Cell cycle response after checkpoint
  blockade. GSEA plots show the enrichment scores of the cell cycle pathway comparing
  baseline to either cycle 1 or cycle 2 after checkpoint blockade. Summary plots show
  most patients had increased cell-cycle activity compared with baseline and there
  was no significant difference between patients with different immunologic outcomes.
  (E) Pathway analysis comparing patients with and without objective response. GSEA
  for all REACTOME pathways was performed on all samples comparing HLA-DR +CD38+ cells
  from baseline to either cycle 1 or cycle 2 cells. The enrichment scores for each
  pathway were then compared between patients with and without objective response
  as defined by RECIST criteria. Volcano plot shows the pathways most significantly
  activated or deactivated in patients with objective responses. (F) Cytosolic sensing
  of DNA after checkpoint blockade. GSEA plots show the enrichment scores of the Cytosolic
  sending of DNA pathway comparing baseline to either cycle 1 or cycle 2 after checkpoint
  blockade. This pathway is highly related to interferon signaling and includes many
  molecules related to this process. This pathway is significantly upregulated in
  the HLA-DR +CD38+T cells of patients with clinical benefit after checkpoint blockade.
  CR, complete response; PR, partial response; PD, progressive disease; RECIST, Response
  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor; SD, stable disease; GSEA, gene set enrichment
  analysis; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity.'
