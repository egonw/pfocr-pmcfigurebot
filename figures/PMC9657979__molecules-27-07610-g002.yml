caption: Protection of H2O2-treated PC-12 cells from mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis
  by SBP and TSP. 10 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL of SBP and TSP were pretreated to cells for
  48 h followed by exposure to 250 μM H2O2. (A) SBP and TSP effect on mitochondrial
  ROS generation, which was detected by immunofluorescence. (B) SBP and TSP effect
  on protein expression. Cleaved-caspase 3, Bcl-2, and Bax protein expression levels
  were analyzed by Western blotting. Data are expressed as the means ± SD (n = 3),
  results marked with different letters (a, b, c, d and e) are significantly different
  (p < 0.05).
