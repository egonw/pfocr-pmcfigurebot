caption: Engineered M. maripaludis shows improved NAD+ recycling rates and NAD(H)
  levels. (A) The NAD pool was manipulated by either overexpression of individual
  genes from the de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway or by insertion of a synthetic
  nadMV salvage pathway. NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NaMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide,
  NaAD, nicotinic acid dinucleotide. (B) Genes from the native de novo NAD+biosynthetic
  pathway were individually overexpressed in M. maripaludis grown in McCas medium
  to assess their impact on the NAD pool. NAD+ (white), NADH (light gray), and total
  nicotinamide cofactor (dark gray) were determined using an enzyme-based luminescence
  assay. 1, wild-type M. maripaludis; 2, Δhpt::MMP0737; 3, Δhpt::nadA; 4, Δhpt::nadC;
  5, Δhpt::MMP1578; 6, Δhpt::MMP1349. MMP0737, aspartate dehydrogenase; nadA, quinolinate
  synthase; nadC, quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase:nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase;
  MMP1578, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase; MMP1349, NAD+ synthase; nadM,
  nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase from M. maripaludis; nadV, nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase from Haemophilus ducreyi. (C) NAD+ (white), NADH (light
  gray), and total nicotinamide cofactor (dark gray) were measured in engineered M.
  maripaludis expressing the nadMV salvage pathway with a supplementation of nicotinamide
  between 0 and 50 mM in McCas medium. (D) Genomic insertion of fdh1 at the upt genomic
  site allows for the use of formate as an energy source for NADH regeneration. (E)
  NAD+ recycling rates were measured for clarified lysates of M. maripaludis engineered
  to express fdh1 and compared with wild-type M. maripaludis, both grown in McCas
  medium. **P < 0.01, two-tailed Student’s t test. All data are reported as mean ±
  SD (n = 3).
