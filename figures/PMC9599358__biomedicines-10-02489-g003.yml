caption: 'c-Myc inhibition increases DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells. PaCa44
  and PT45 cells were treated with cMyc inhibitor (i-cMyc) (50 μM) for 48 h. (A) DNA
  damage was evaluated studying the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX). βActin
  was used as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The histograms
  represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of γH2AX /Act. p
  value: **** <0.0001. (B) BRCA1, (C) Ku86 and (D) ATM expression were evaluated by
  Western blot analyses. βActin was used as loading control and one representative
  experiment is shown. The histograms represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis
  of the ratio of BRCA1 /Act, Ku86/Act and ATM/Act. p value *** <0.001; ns = not significant.
  (E) NQO1 expression was evaluated by Western blot analyses. βActin was used as loading
  control and one representative experiment is shown. The histograms represent the
  mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of NQO1/Act. p value * <0.05; **
  <0.01; (F) Intracellular ROS level was measured by FACS analysis using DCFDA as
  staining. Mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) is indicated. One representative
  experiment out of three is reported. Auto means autofluorescence of unstained control
  cells; The bars in the histogram represent the means of MFI of three independent
  experiments. p-value: **** <0.0001.'
