caption: Identification of specialized metabolic pathways in M. dodecandrum. (A) The
  number and types of putative specialized metabolic pathways identified by PathwayTools.
  (B) Identification of the top 5 most and least expressed pathways from each organ.
  The scale represents the rank of a pathway (white = lowest rank, dark blue = highest
  rank). The rows represent pathways, while the columns indicate the sampled organs
  (as in ). The lower rank (lighter color) indicates a higher expression. (C) Clustering
  analysis of flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (PWY-7897).
