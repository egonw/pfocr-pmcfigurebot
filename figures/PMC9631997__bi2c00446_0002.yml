caption: 'apPol domain organization, the kinetic pathway of nucleotide incorporation
  by DNA polymerases and DNA substrates used in primer extension assays. (A) Domain
  organization of P. falciparum apPol. Domain boundaries are based on the crystal
  structure of apPol, and the two residues (D82 and E84) of the proofreading exonuclease
  domain that were mutated (to N and Q, respectively) to eliminate the exonuclease
  activity are highlighted. NTD: N-terminal domain (orange), proofreading: 3′ to 5′
  proofreading exonuclease domain (red). The palm, thumb, and fingers domains are
  colored in magenta, green, and blue, respectively. (B) Minimal kinetic pathway for
  nucleotide incorporation by a DNA polymerase (Pol), where DNAn: DNA substrate with
  a primer strand n bases long, DNAn+1: DNA substrate with a primer strand n+1 bases
  long, PPi: inorganic pyrophosphate, and Pol’: DNA polymerase translocated by one
  base. (C) DNA substrates used to define the polymerization pathway of apPol. The
  templating base positions (T0) and the one immediately 5′ to it (T1) are shaded
  blue and orange, respectively. The oxidatively damaged nucleotides (ODNs) are highlighted
  in bold and represented as X: 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine monophosphate (8-oxo-dGMP)
  and—: tetrahydrofuran apurinic/apyrimidinic site (abasic site) analogue. “*” represents
  the 5′FAM label.'
