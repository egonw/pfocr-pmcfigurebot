caption: Positive correlation between CXCL1 and the number of tumor vessels. a, c
  Immunofluorescence assay revealed that CXCL1 overexpression significantly elevated
  CD31 expression in the colon cancer models, whereas CXCL1 knockout in MC38 resulted
  in an inhibition of CD31 expression (× 200). b MC38.CXCL1+/+ tumors surrounded by
  abundant blood vessels. **P < 0.01
