figure_title: scATAC-seq analysis and heterogeneity of regulation between MGE and
  LGE
caption: a Cell types in scATAC-seq visualized by UMAP after lift-over based on scRNA-seq
  data. b Accessible degrees of classic marker genes expressed in progenitors and
  different GE regions. c Differentially accessible chromatin peaks upstream of ZNF503
  (top) and LHX8 (bottom). d Gene regulatory network generated based on integration
  of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. e Hub genes of different GE regions deduced by protein–protein
  interactions. f Predicted regulatory pathway of MIR9-1HG. Upstream of MIR9-1HG were
  divided into three groups based on predicted binding site represented by different
  line colors. Dot colors share legends as in d. g Expression pattern of MIR9-1HG
  in human integrated data and its correlation with other genes in different cell
  clusters. False discovery rates were adjusted by BH method to generate “P. adjust”.
  h Open region of MIR9-1HG and predicted related TF binding sites. Specific peaks
  in MGE or progenitor clusters compared with LGE were marked (left) and predicted
  binding sites of upstream TFs were mapped to these regions (right).
