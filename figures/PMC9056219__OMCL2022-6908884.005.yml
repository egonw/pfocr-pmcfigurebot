caption: 'EDA inhibited the PM-induced oxidative stress in lung tissues. Mice were
  intratracheally instilled with PM at 100 μg/day/mouse for 2 consecutive days. EDA
  (2, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected prior to PM exposure for 1 h.
  (a) ROS levels in lung tissues were examined by DHE staining. Relative DHE fluorescence
  is shown in (b). (c) MDA levels were measured in the lung tissues. Values are the
  mean ± SEM; ∗P < 0.05 or ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05
  or ##P < 0.01, compared with the PM group; n = 3 or 5. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate
  matter.'
