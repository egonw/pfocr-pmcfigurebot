caption: 'Performance of the developed deep learning algorithm in field-dependent
  energetics. (a) Estimated average error of field-dependent adsorption energies,
  given the configurations and the corresponding adsorption energies at 0.0 and ±0.6
  V/Å, respectively, (b) comparison between the DFT adsorption energies and the deep
  learning-predicted adsorption energies of ammonia synthesis-related intermediates
  over Ru(0001) and Ru(1013) surfaces, (c) ablation study of different components
  within our framework (i.e., ALL model: adsorbate adsorption over the surface, the
  adsorbate in the gas phase, and surface geometry and their corresponding energetics,
  no surf model: without surface geometry and energy from the ALL model, no ads model:
  without adsorbate in the gas-phase geometry and energy from the ALL model, and no
  surf and ads model: adsorbate adsorption over the surface only), (d) with the given
  the configurations and the corresponding adsorption energies at 0.0 and ±0.6 V/Å,
  the performance of our deep learning model of electric field effects on the adsorption
  energies with 5% outliers being removed is within 0.08 eV, 0.09 eÅ, and 0.06 eÅ2/V
  for Ead (no fields), dipole moments and polarizability, respectively, and (e) deep
  learning-predicted field-dependent reaction energies of N2 dissociation and N2H
  formation over Ru(1013). The purple dash refers to the critical electric field from
  DFT in c that changes the pathway. The blue and orange band represents the standard
  deviation of field-dependent reaction energies of these two elementary steps and
  (f) Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for the field-dependent energy diagrams
  of DFT and deep learning results over Ru surfaces with 5% outliers being removed.
  The yellow area refers to a strong positive relationship with r greater than 0.85.
  Bold dashes represent the correlations of energy diagrams of two reaction pathways
  over Ru(1013) under a positive electric field of 1 V/Å.'
