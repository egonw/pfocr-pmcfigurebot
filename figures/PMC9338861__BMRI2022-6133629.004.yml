caption: 'Berberine induces autophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR/Ulk1 signaling pathway
  in nucleus pulposus cells. (a, b) NP cells were treated with IL-1β, BBR and IL-1β,
  or BBR, IL-1β, and compound c (CC, AMPK inhibitor). (a) Protein expressions were
  measured by immunoblot and (b) the relative protein expression was analyzed by the
  ImageJ software. ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with the control group; ##P < 0.01 compared
  with the IL-1β group; &&P < 0.01 compared with the BBR + IL-1β group.'
