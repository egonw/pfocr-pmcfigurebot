caption: Transcriptome analysis of steatotic versus untreated cells. (A) Volcano plot
  showing that 209 mRNAs were statistically differentially regulated (black dots;
  â‰¥2-fold difference, adjusted p < 0.05), of which 51 were significantly upregulated
  and 158 significantly downregulated. (B) Top 15 individual up- and downregulated
  transcripts between StCs and UCs. (C) Top five up- and downregulated canonical pathways
  identified by IPA. (D) Top two canonical pathways identified by IPA using up- or
  downregulated genes and the number of molecules involved. The ratio indicates the
  number of genes in the analyzed data over the number of genes known to be involved
  in the pathway.
