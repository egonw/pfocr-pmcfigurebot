caption: 'Prediction results of signaling pathways involved in the intestinal flora
  of each experimental group in the Eimeria spp. challenge experiment. The Tax4Fun
  assignment was utilized to predict the function of the intestinal flora and was
  used to classify KEGG pathway identification according to three levels: Level 1
  (A), level 2 (B), and level 3 (C). The prediction was performed by cal_tax4fun2
  function in R package microeco. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes'
