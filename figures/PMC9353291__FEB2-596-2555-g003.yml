caption: 'Two models for protein‐mediated lipid drug delivery. (A) Equilibrium model.
  The lipid–ligand interaction is defined by a traditional dissociation equilibrium
  (K D), with the ligand existing as either in the protein‐bound or free monomeric/aqueous
  form (i). Sequestration by serum albumins (iii) and transfer to lipid vesicles (ii)
  occur via the free monomeric form, and are thus dependent on K D: a small K D yields
  a small concentration of free ligand, protecting it from sequestration but hindering
  transfer to its target bilayer. Large K D values favour the generation of the free
  monomeric ligand species, promoting both ligand transfer and sequestration/dissociation.
  (B) Direct transfer model. AEG12 binds to the target membrane (inset), where it
  can exchange lipids directly with the target membrane. Ligand transfer via this
  pathway () is not dependent on the generation of the free monomeric ligand (K D),
  allowing AEG12 to support rapid and effective ligand transfer on the minutes timescale
  while retaining tight ligand‐binding affinities in solution. [Colour figure can
