caption: One-carbon metabolism and methyl-donor micronutrients. This figure shows
  the main components of one-carbon metabolism, folate cycle, methionine cycle, transsulfuration
  pathway and the contribution of micronutrients such as choline, betaine, folate,
  methionine, VitB2, VitB6, and VitB12 in several biological processes. Biological
  processes are highlighted in gray. Micronutrients are highlighted in red. Enzymes
  are highlighted in light blue (THF = tetrahydrofolate, SAM = S-adenosylmethionine,
  SAH = S-adenosylhomocysteine, SAHH = SAH hydrolase, BHMT = betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase, PEMT = phosphotidylethanolaminetransferase, MAT = methionine
  acetyltransferase, MS = methionine synthase, MTHFR = methyltetrahydrofolate reductase,
  ChAT = choline acetyltransferase, AchE = acetylcholine esterase. Adopted from Bekdash,
  2023 and slightly modified [].
