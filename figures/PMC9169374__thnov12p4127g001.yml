caption: 'Exosomes derived from breast cancer cells with high metastatic potential
  promote angiogenesis. A. Transmission electron microscopy showed the morphology
  of exosomes derived from high or low-metastatic breast cancer cells. Scale bar:
  200 nm. B Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of exosomes derived from high or
  low-metastatic breast cancer cells. The results showed that exosomes derived from
  4 different breast cancer cells were comparable in size. C Western blot analysis
  of the isolated exosomes derived from indicated cell lines. Equal amounts of protein
  (100 μg) was loaded and analyzed. Alix, TSG101 and CD81 are specific markers for
  exosomes, while Calnexin was used to monitor cytoplasm contamination of isolated
  exosomes. D PKH-26-labeled exosomes can be endocytosed into the recipient cells.
  Scale bar: 200 μm. E HM-Exos significantly enhanced the tube-forming ability of
  endothelial cells compared to LM-Exos and control. Scale bar: 200 μm. F Compared
  with LM-Exos and control, HM-Exos significantly enhanced the capillary sprouting
  ability of rat arterial rings. Scale bar: 200 μm. G, H HM-Exos significantly enhanced
  the migration ability of endothelial cells compared to LM-Exos and control. Scale
  bar: 200 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, and all experiments were repeated
  at least three times. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ns P > 0.05 indicate
  no statistical significance. High Metastatic, HM; Ligh Metastatic, LM; Exosomes,
  Exos.'

  signaling.
