caption: Tumor‐promoting effects of serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) on neutrophils in vivo.
  (A) Images of dissected xenografted tumors implanted subcutaneously with 4T1 cells,
  which were treated with or without anti‐SAA1 and anti‐Ly6G Ab after 30 days. (B)
  Tumor growth curves determined by caliper measurements shown as mean (mm3) ± SEM.
  N = 10/group. (C) Representative immunohistochemistry staining of SAA1 and CD66b
  in xenografted tumors implanted subcutaneously with 4T1 cells, which were treated
  with or without anti‐SAA1 and anti‐Ly6G Ab. Scale bar = 50 μm
