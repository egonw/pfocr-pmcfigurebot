caption: Schematic representation of the canonical (Smad-dependent) TGFβ pathway and
  TGFβ signaling therapies which have undergone clinical trials in GBM. TGFβ binding
  to TGFβ receptors II (TGFβRII) results in phosphorylation and activation of TGFβ
  receptors I (TGFβRI), phosphorylation of Smad 2/3, which interact with Smad 4 and
  form a complex that translocates into the nucleus to activate target genes. Antisense
  oligonucleotides (AP12009), anti-integrins, kinase inhibitors (LY2157299, LY2109761)
  or neutralizing antibodies (1D11, GC1008) used for targeting TGFβ signaling pathway
  are presented in red. Based on [] and references included in the main text.
