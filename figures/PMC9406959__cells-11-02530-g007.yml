caption: The canonical Hippo pathway and its pharmaceutical inhibitors. Various extracellular
  signals including mechanical stress, cellular contact, hormones and growth factors
  activates Hippo signaling cascades that through serial phosphorylations involving
  block of kinases inhibits nuclear translocation of transcriptional co-activator
  YAP/TAZ and consequently their involvement in the regulation of gene transcription.
  When Hippo pathway is inactive, YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus, associates
  with TEAD family of transcription factors and participates in the regulation of
  target genes expression. Inhibitors that target important pathway components are
  indicated in red. References are included in the main text.
