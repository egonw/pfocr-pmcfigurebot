caption: 'Development, maintenance, and establishment of zonation in the mice definitive
  adrenal cortex: (A) Schematics model for the definitive cortex maintenance. A WNT/SHH
  double-paracrine mechanism is needed to ensure proper development and maintenance
  of the adrenal cortex. Capsular stem cells regulate WNT pathway activation in the
  progenitor zG cells by secreting RSPO3, which in turn induces the clearance from
  the cell membrane of the WNT signaling inhibitor ZNRF3 and its subsequent degradation.
  This leads to an increase in canonical WNT signaling in the subcapsular progenitor
  and it promotes their proliferation (and subsequent differentiation into steroidogenic
  zG cells). Capsular WNT2B could be the main ligand responsible for the maintenance
  of the adrenal cortex (as WNT4 expressed in the zG appears to be more important
  for the differentiation of the steroidogenic zG cells). SHH secreted by the zG progenitor
  cells promotes the activation of GLI1 in the capsular stem cells and, consequently,
  their proliferation. Before puberty, both the capsular stem cells and subcapsular
  progenitor cells contribute to the maintenance of the adrenal cortex. After puberty,
  both the capsular stem cells and subcapsular progenitor cells contribute to the
  maintenance of the adrenal cortex in female. In male, only the subcapsular progenitor
  cells contribute to the maintenance of the adrenal cortex. (B) Schematics model
  for adrenal cortex zonation. Capsular and subcapsular WNTs and RSPO3 secretion create
  a gradient of WNT/CTNNB1 activity throughout the upper cortex. Elevated WNT/CTNNB1
  activity drives steroidogenic zG cells differentiation and inhibits differentiation
  of zG cells into zF. PDE2A (whose transcription is positively regulated by CTNNB1)
  could be involved in the inhibition of PKA signaling in the zG by degrading cAMP.
  Moderate/low WNT/CTNNB1 favors the differentiation of zG cells into zF cells and
  the proliferation of zF cells. Binding of ACTH to its receptor promotes the activation
  of PKA signaling and antagonizes WNT signaling. Potential expression of FRZB or
  SFRP2 in the zF could also contribute to the inhibition of WNT signaling in the
  zF. PKA signaling is also optimized by adrenocortical cell programming by EZH2,
  which inhibits the transcription of Pde7b, Pde3a and Pde1b.'
