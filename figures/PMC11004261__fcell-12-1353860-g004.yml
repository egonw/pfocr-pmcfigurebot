caption: The p53-MDM2 pathway in NB. This pathway is mainly regulated by various proteins
  such as ARF, BMI-1, BHL, and FAK. All these pathways lead to alteration in cell
  cycle arrest, proliferation, angiogenesis, and promotion of apoptosis. FAK, Focal
  Adhesion Kinase; MYCN, myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma;
  MDM2, Murine double minute 2; VEGF, Vascular endothelial growth factor; TSLC1, Tumor
  suppressor in Lung Cancer; p53, Tumor protein p53.
