figure_title: ANXA2 induction of Arg1 mRNA expression requires TLR2/MYD88 signaling
caption: (A) Representative dot plots depicting TLR2 and TLR4 expression in ARG1+
  and ARG1– TANs from PL mice. (B) Tabulation of percentage of TLR2+TLR4–, TLR2+TLR4+,
  and TLR2–TLR4+ cells in the ARG1+ TANs from PL-tumor-bearing (n = 8) and LLC-tumor-bearing
  (n = 5) mice. (C) Peripheral blood HDNs from tumor-free WT, Tlr2–/–, Tlr4–/–, and
  Myd88–/– mice were treated with PL-TL (n = 3–6) or (D) LLC-TL (n = 4–8) (100 μg/mL)
  for 16 hours. Data expressed as Arg1 mRNA expression fold change in TL-treated HDNs
  compared with PBS control. (E) Peripheral blood HDNs from tumor-free WT, Tlr2–/–,
  and Myd88–/– mice were treated with recombinant mouse ANXA2 (1 μg/mL) for 16 hours.
  Data expressed as Arg1 mRNA expression fold change in ANXA2-treated HDNs compared
  with PBS control (n = 4–6). (F) Peripheral blood HDNs from tumor-free WT, Tlr2–/–,
  and Myd88–/– mice were treated with IL-10 (10 U/mL), IL-4 (10 U/mL), LPS (0.1 μg/mL),
  LTA (20 μg/mL), or vehicle control for 16 hours. Data expressed as Arg1 mRNA expression
  fold change versus PBS control (n = 4–6 per group). *P < 0.05 by 1-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s post hoc test.
