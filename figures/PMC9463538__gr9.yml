caption: Reduced IGF1R/IR and Akt signaling pathway in TDIFFcells generated by directed
  in vitro differentiation of MAP3K4 kinase–inactive TS cells to syncytiotrophoblasts.A–C,
  MAP3K4 inactivation disrupts the in vitro differentiation of TS cells to syncytiotrophoblasts.
  qPCR data normalized to Gapdh are expressed as a fold change relative to undifferentiated
  TSWT cells and are the mean ± range of 2 biologically independent experiments. TS
  cells were either cultured under stem cell conditions (0) or differentiated for
  4 days (4) in the absence or the presence of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR 99021. (Cdx2,
  stem marker; Prl2c2, giant cell marker, Synb, SynT-II marker). D–F, reduced expression
  and phosphorylation of the IGF1R and IR after CHIR-directed TS cell differentiation
  to syncytiotrophoblasts (TDIFF). Site 2 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1135 and pIRβ Tyr1150,
  and site 3 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1136 and pIRβ Tyr1151. Western blotting images
  simultaneously show 3 biologically independent experiments. E and F, densitometry
  analyses are shown. Total IGF1Rβ and IRβ protein expression was normalized to ERK2.
  Phosphorylated IGF1Rβ and IRβ were normalized to ERK2, IGF1Rβ, or IRβ as indicated.
  G and H, reduced phosphorylation of Akt in KI trophoblasts after directed TS cell
  differentiation. G, Western blotting images simultaneously show 3 biologically independent
  experiments. H, densitometry analyses show normalization of phosphorylated Akt to
  total Akt1. I and J, PDK1 expression and Ser241 phosphorylation after directed TS
  cell differentiation. I, Western blotting images simultaneously show 3 biologically
  independent experiments. J, PDK1 expression was normalized to ERK2. PDK1 phosphorylation
  was normalized to ERK2 or PDK1. PTEN inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser380/Thr382/Thr383
  was normalized to PTEN protein levels. K and L, reduced phosphorylation of GSK3α
  and GSK3β in KI cells after directed TS cell differentiation. K, Western blotting
  images simultaneously show 3 biologically independent experiments. L, densitometry
  analyses with phosphorylated GSK3α normalized to total GSK3α protein, and phosphorylated
  GSK3β normalized to total GSK3β protein. E, F, H, J, and L, densitometry analyses
  show the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;
