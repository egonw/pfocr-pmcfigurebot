caption: 'ASPS protected radiation-damaged nematodes against PA14 by elevating innate
  immune response. (a) PA14 growth curve in the presence of 1mg/mL ASPS. n = 3. (b)
  Pharynx pump rate of nematodes at 24 h after PA14 infection. n = 20. (c) Colony-forming
  units (CFUs) of PA14 in nematodes at 24 h after PA14 infection. n = 3. (d) PA14
  virulence factors (protease activity, elastase activity and biofilm formation).
  PA14 was cultured at 37 Â°C for 24 h with or without ASPS. n = 3. (e) Early immune
  response genes. The genes were measured at 12 h after PA14 infection. n = 3. (f)
  Late immune response genes. The genes were measured at 24 h after PA14 infection.
  n = 3. Significant difference from the control group was designated as * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01, and significant difference from the radiation group was designated
  as #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01, respectively.'
