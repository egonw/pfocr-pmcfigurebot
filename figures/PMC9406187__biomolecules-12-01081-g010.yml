caption: Effect of squalene and 25-hydroxycholesterol-3-sulfate (25HC3S) on Caco-2
  cells. (A) Schematic illustration for effects of cholesterol precursor and inhibitors
  on cancer cells. (B) Cell viability of cancer cells treated with different concentrations
  of squalene at different times (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h). (C) Cell viability
  of cancer cells treated with different concentrations of 25HC3S at 48 h. (D) Expression
  levels of targeted genes of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Data are presented
  as Mean ± Standard Error (three biological replicates per group). Statistical significance
  by Student’s t test; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.
