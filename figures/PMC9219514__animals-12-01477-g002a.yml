caption: Effect of ATRA on the differentiation of preadipocytes from Yanbian yellow
  cattle. (a) Oil Red O staining of pre-adipocytes (200×) after treatment with different
  concentrations of ATRA after the ninth day of differentiation. (b) The lipid content
  of differentiated cells was quantified by extracting Oil Red O with isopropanol
  and measuring its absorption at 520 nm. (c,d) Quantitative reverse-transcription
  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to determine
  the levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα, ERK2, ADPN (c) mRNA and (d) protein in ATRA treatment
  groups. Different lowercase letters in the figure indicate significant differences
  compared with the control group, p < 0.05. Different capital letters indicate highly
  significant differences compared with the control group, p < 0.01. Full Western
  Blot  and  are provided in the .
