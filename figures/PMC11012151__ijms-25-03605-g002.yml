caption: Role of miR-181b in exercise-mediated alleviation of DN. In DN animal models,
  exercise activates the AMPK signaling pathway in the vascular endothelial cell of
  the kidney by enhancing renal vascular blood flow. Activation of AMPK promotes Pink1
  expression, leading to mitochondrial autophagy and a reduction in oxidative stress.
  AMPK activation also increases the expression of miR-181b, which inhibits phosphatase
  and tension homolog (PTEN)-mediated conversion of PIP3 into PIP2, thereby enhancing
  AKT phosphorylation. It plays an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role by inhibiting
  BAD signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of P65, and the nuclear translocation
  of FOXOs. At the same time, it can promote mitophagy by activating Pink1 signaling
  pathway. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 12 March 2024.
