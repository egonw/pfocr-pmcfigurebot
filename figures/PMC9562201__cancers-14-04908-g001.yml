caption: DMA treatment induced the killing of cancer cells and decreased cell migration
  in head and neck cell lines and HNMT1 primary cells. (A) Chemical structure of DMA.
  Cytotoxicity of DMA on (B) HK-1, (C) FaDu, and (D) tongue squamous cell carcinoma
  patient-derived primary (HNMT1) cells determined through MTT assay. (E–G) Clonogenic
  survival curves of HK-1, FaDu, and HNMT1 cells treated with DMA at 6, 11, and 34
  µm for 2 h before X-ray irradiation at 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy, respectively. (H) Time
  course of scratch closures; HK-1 monolayers were mechanically scratched with a sterile
  pipette tip following treatment with 10 or 15 µM DMA, 4 Gy radiation, and DMA +
  4 Gy radiation. (I–K) The relative size of the open scratch area was measured at
  24, 48, and 72 h following treatment with 10 or 15 µM DMA, 4 Gy radiation, and DMA
  + 4 Gy radiation. (L) Representative atomic force microscopy images of morphological
  changes in untreated HK-1 cells, cells treated with 10 or 15 µM DMA for 2 h, 4 Gy
  radiation, and DMA treatment for 2 h followed by 4 Gy radiation (DMA + 4 Gy). Scale
  bar = 10 µm. Data are shown as means ± SEM of three replicates. * p value < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.005 and *** p value < 0.0005.
