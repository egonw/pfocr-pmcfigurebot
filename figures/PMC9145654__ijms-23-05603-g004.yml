caption: 'TGFβ-hPMSC co-culture regulated SMAD signaling pathway. (A) Protein lysates
  from TAO OFs were used to western blot for analysis of phosphorylation-SMAD protein
  on day 10 (e.g., p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3) expression levels (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  vs. Negative control vs. adipogenesis induced OFs; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. adipogenesis-induced
  OFs; + p < 0.05, ++ p<0.01 vs. OF + hPMSCs; † p < 0.05, ††† p < 0.001 vs. OF + TGFβ-hPMSCs;
  ‡p < 0.05 vs. SB + OF+ hPMSCs). (B) Mouse orbital tissue lysates were investigated
  by western blot to detect p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 expression levels. Expression levels
  were normalized to β-actin, and the values of OS were divided OD. Data were presented
  as a fold change (mean± SEM) (# p < 0.05 vs. Sham; ++ p < 0.01, +++ p < 0.001 vs.
  hPMSCs). Sham n = 3, hPMSCs n = 3, TGFβ-hPMSCs n = 2, STE (steroid) n = 3.'
