caption: Transcriptional analysis of CAR NK‐92 and C4‐2 cells after coculture. (A)
  Volcano plots of the dysregulated genes between cocultured and uncocultured CAR
  NK 92 cells. (B) Volcano plots of the dysregulated genes between cocultured and
  uncocultured C4‐2 cells. In (A) and (B), genes differentially expressed with a fold
  change greater than 2.0 and p < .05 are marked in colour. The p‐values were calculated
  using a two‐sided unpaired Student's t‐test. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in CAR NK‐92 cells
  following incubation with C4‐2 cells. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated
  genes in CAR NK‐92 cells following incubation with C4‐2 cells. (E) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in C4‐2 cells following coculture with
  CAR NK‐92 cells. In (C, D, E,) the colour of the dots represents the rich factor,
  and the size represents the input number of each KEGG term. The horizontal axis
  indicates the significance of enrichment. The vertical axis indicates the enriched
  KEGG pathway (20 most enriched terms). (F) Representative flow cytometry plots and
  data (n = 3) of NKG2D expression on CAR NK‐92 cells. (G) Representative flow cytometry
  plots and data (n = 3) of MICA/B expression in C4‐2 cells.
