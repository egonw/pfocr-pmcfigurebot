caption: 'Celecoxib inactivates the Akt/mTORC1 signaling and represses its downstream
  lipogenic proteins in vitro. For AKT transient transfection, hepatoma HepG2 and
  HuH‐7 cells were seeded on plates and transfected with AKT constructs for 24 h as
  described in the Methods section. The transfected cells were further incubated with
  celecoxib (10–50 μM). Western blotting (A, C) and quantitative analysis (B, D) were
  performed to analyze the expressions of key components in the Akt/mTORC1 signaling
  and its downstream lipogenic pathway. β‐actin was used as an internal reference.
  Immunoreactive bands (including those with white backgrounds) were visualized in
  a gel documentation system (G: BOX Chemi XRQ, Syngene) without further modification.
  Quantified data are presented as mean ± SD, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus the
  MOCK group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus the AKT‐transfected group.
  Abbreviations: CELE, celecoxib; t, total; p, phosphorylated'
