figure_title: KLF6 promotes fibrosis of HK-2 cells by activating the NF-κB signaling
  pathway
caption: 'A PPI network of KLF6 and its top ten related genes constructed using the
  String website. The redder the color of the gene, the higher the degree of correlation;
  the bluer the color of the gene, the lower the degree of correlation. B A diagram
  of the correlation between KLF6 and NFKB1 expression. C A box line diagram of NFKB1
  expression data from the GSE36496 dataset. The blue box on the left represents the
  expression in normal control samples and the red box on the right represents the
  expression in renal fibrosis samples. D The transduction efficiency of oe-KLF6 and
  sh-KLF6 as verified by RT-qPCR in HK-2 cells. *p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC. #p < 0.05 vs.
  sh-NC. E The effect of KLF6 on the mRNA expression of α-SMA, Col4α1, and TGF-β in
  HK-2 cells as detected by RT-qPCR. *p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC. #p < 0.05 vs. sh-NC. F Western
  blot analysis of α-SMA, Col4α1 and TGF-β protein expression in HK-2 cells with KLF6
  overexpression or knockdown. *p < 0.05 vs. oe-NC. #p < 0.05 vs. sh-NC. G Western
  blot analysis of IκBα phosphorylation and α-SMA, Col4α1, and TGF-β protein expression
  in HK-2 cells after treatment with KLF6 overexpressing vector and BAY-11-7082. *p < 0.05
  vs. NC. #p < 0.05 vs. TGF-β-1 + KLF6. The cell experiment was repeated three independent
  times.'
