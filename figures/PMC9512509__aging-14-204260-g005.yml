caption: 'Effect of Phps on APAP-induced acute liver injury were dependent on Nrf2.
  The mice were received Phps (80 mg/kg) prior 1h APAP (500 mg/kg) injection and liver
  was collected for Western blot. (A, B) are protein bands of Nrf2 signaling pathway;
  (C–F) represent the ratio of HO-1, GCLC, GCLM and NQO1protein to β-actin. All data
  are presented as mean ± SD (three independent experiments). #p < 0.05 and ##p <
  0.01 vs. control group; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 vs. APAP group.'
