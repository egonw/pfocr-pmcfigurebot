caption: Adap−/− macrophages exhibit enhanced FcγR-dependent phagocytic ability and
  upregulated proinflammatory signaling. A Phagocytosis of DiI-labeled anti-CD61 IgG-
  or isotype control IgG-opsonized platelets by peritoneal macrophages prepared from
  WT mice and Adap−/− mice (n = 6 for anti-CD61 IgG, n = 4 for IgG ctrl, two-way ANOVA,
  Tukey’s multiple comparison). The phagocytic index was calculated as the mean fluorescence
  intensity multiplied by the frequency of DiI-positive cells. B Phagocytosis of PKH26-labeled
  anti-SRBC IgG- or isotype control IgG-opsonized SRBCs by macrophages. Left panel,
  BMDMs prepared from WT mice and Adap−/− mice (n = 8 for anti-SRBC IgG, n = 4 for
  IgG ctrl, two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison) were subjected to phagocytosis
  assay as assessed by flow cytometry and presented as phagocytic index. Right panel,
  ADAP KO RAW 264.7 cells stably reconstituted with either empty vector or ADAP WT
  construct (n = 5 each, two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison) were subjected
  to phagocytosis assay with PKH26-labeled IgG-opsonized SRBC, and fold induction
  in phagocytic index was calculated by dividing the value of each group by those
  of empty vector-transfected cells at 5 min. C Phagocytosis of complement-opsonized
  Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated zymosan A particles by WT and Adap−/− (n = 6 mice each)
  BMDMs. D Immunoblot analysis of ERK1/2, AKT, p38 and SHP-1 phosphorylation in WT
  and Adap−/− BMDMs stimulated for the indicated time points with aggregated IgG (AIgG).
  E BMDMs from WT and Adap−/− mice (n = 11 mice each) were either left unstimulated
  (WT-NC and Adap−/−-NC) or stimulated with FcOxyBurst reagent, and the development
  of green fluorescence was monitored by flow cytometry over a 10 min period. Each
  dot represents the mean value from three independent experiments. F Significantly
  enriched signaling pathways from the upregulated genes in Adap−/− macrophages relative
  to WT macrophages. The dot size indicates the number of genes enriched in each pathway,
  while the dot color indicates the statistical significance of the enrichment. G
  GSEA of the indicated datasets in Adap−/− macrophages relative to WT macrophages.
  Normalized enrichment score (NES) and the FDR q-value of each enrichment are shown.
