caption: 'Hypoxic CM from GC cells induced NET formation through activation of the
  p38 MAPK pathway in neutrophils. A and B, Western blot analysis of p-ERK, p-p38,
  p-p65, p-Akt, and p-STAT3 levels in neutrophils cocultured with hypoxic-CM from
  GC cells for 2 h. C-E, Neutrophils were pretreated with inhibitors of the ERK, p38
  MAPK, and p65 NF-кB pathways prior to incubation with hypoxic-CM from GC cells.
  The protein levels of p-ERK, p-p38, and p-p65 in neutrophils were measured by western
  blotting, and NET formation by neutrophils was evaluated with MPO and citH3 staining.
  Magnification: 20 × . Scale bars: 50 μm. All values are the means ± SDs. ns = not
  significant, *p < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared to the control group; #p < 0.05 and
  ##p < 0.01 compared to the hypoxic-CM (24 h) group'
