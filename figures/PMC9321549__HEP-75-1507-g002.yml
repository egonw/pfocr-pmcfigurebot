caption: SWAP70 inhibits JNK1/2‐P38 pathway in mice liver and hepatocytes under metabolic
  stimulation. (A) Volcano plot showed DEGs in the livers of Swap70‐Flox or Swap70‐HKO
  mice under HFHC treatment. (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis
  identified most significantly changed pathway according to DEGs. (C) The protein
  levels of phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, P38, and JNK1/2 in liver tissues from
  Swap70‐Flox and Swap70‐HKO mice with HFHC diet (n = 3/group). Quantitative result
  shown on the right. (D) The protein levels of phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, P38,
  and JNK1/2 in liver tissues from control and Swap70‐OE mice with HFHC diet (n = 3/group).
  Quantitative result shown on the right. (E,F) The expression levels of phosphorylated
  and total ERK1/2, P38, and JNK1/2 in SWAP70 knockdown (E) or overexpression (F)
  L02 cells and their control cells under PA stimulation for 0, 3, 6, and 12 hours
  (n = 3 independent experiments). Student t test was used. All data are shown as
  mean ± SD. **p < 0.01
