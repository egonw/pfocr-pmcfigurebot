figure_title: Schematic diagram of the MIDRS-mediated precision killing of tumor cells
  through recognition of tumor cell–specific SNVs in mtDNA
caption: (A) The mtDNA mutation-induced drug release system (MIDRS) consists of DNA/Mg2+
  hybrid nanoflowers (DNF) coding cytochrome C aptamer (Cyt C apt), Cas12a/crRNA,
  and quenched photosensitizer Ce6 (Ce6-Q). (B) The photodynamic activity of MIDRS
  is silenced during circulation and extra-mitochondrial distribution. After endocytosis,
  MIDRS through Cyt C apt mediation efficiently identifies SNVs in mtDNA in cancer
  cells, splicing mtDNA, and inducing gene silencing and inhibition of mitochondrial
  respiratory functions. (C) In tumor cells, the trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a
  is activated by its unique SNVs in mtDNA, thereby cleaving the blocked photosensitizer
  Ce6 carrier to restore the photosensitivity of Ce6. Cytotoxic reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) are generated by laser irradiation, further damaging the mitochondria and
  releasing mtDNA into the cytoplasm. This activates the cGAS-STING pathway, leading
  to the specific killing of the tumor cells and promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation
  and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. (D) Colocalization analysis of
  MIDRS-released Ce6 in tumor tissues with tumor cells (mutant mtDNA) and macrophages
  (wild-type mtDNA). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (λex = 405 nm, λem = 430 nm), monocytes
  were labeled with an anti-CD45 antibody (λex = 488 nm, λem = 520 nm), and Ce6 was
  instead by Cy5 (λex = 638 nm, λem = 670 nm). Scale bar, 200 μm.
