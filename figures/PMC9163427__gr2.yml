caption: Defective mRNA translation and altered gene expression after EFNB2 silencing(A)
  Experimental design. Linear sucrose gradient profile of polysomes isolated from
  clone 596-7 with or without Dox treatment. The positions of the small (S) and large
  (L) ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and polysomes are indicated; one of two experiments.
  (B) Time-dependent activation of phospho (p)-eIF2α (S51) in clone 596-7 treated
  with Dox; representative immunoblot of three experiments. (C) Magnitude (fold change)
  and statistical significance of changes in RNA expression induced by Dox in clone
  596-7 over 24 h compared with uninduced 596-7 cells. RNA expression by total RNA-seq.
  Each dot in the volcano plot represents an annotated RNA; significantly induced
  RNAs are shown as red dots and significantly repressed RNAs are shown as blue dots.
  Some RNAs are identified as gene products. Vertical and horizontal dotted lines
  reflect cutoffs for the parameters fold change and significance. (D) Genes expressed
  at significantly different levels (p < 0.005) in control and Dox-treated 596-7 cells
  (n = 4/group) displayed by row-wide Z score (color bar) ordered alphabetically.
  The gene categories are inclusive of pathways “endoplasmic reticulum stress,” “unfolded
  protein response,” “role of PKR in interferon induction,” and “pattern recognition
  receptors” (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). (E) Differentially expressed (p < 0.005)
  “cell death and survival” genes (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) in control and Dox-treated
  596-7 cells (n = 4/group) displayed by row-wide Z score (color bar) ordered alphabetically.
  (F) Time-dependent PKR phosphorylation (T446) and eIF2α phosphorylation (S51) in
  596-7 cells treated with Dox; PERK (T980) and GCN2 (T899) are not phosphorylated.
  Representative immunoblotting from three experiments. See also .
