figure_title: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activation upon glucose scarcity promotes
  EGF stimulation of anchorage-independent growth
caption: (A) Representative Western blotting of the indicated proteins in human bronchial
  epithelial cells (HBECs) cells grown for 48 h in 10, 1, or 0.1 mM glucose (Glc)-containing
  medium with and without GlcNAc and/or EGF supplementation. Tubulin is used as a
  loading control. (B) Representative images (right hand) and size analysis (left
  hand) of HBEC spheroids grown under 10 mM glucose control condition or 0.1 mM glucose
  without or with GlcNAc and/or EGF supplementation. ****P < 0.0001, **P < 0.01 (unpaired
  t test, mean ± SEM). Scale bars = 100 μm. (B, C) Cell viability assay of HBECs spheroids
  grown and treated as in (B). * *P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 (unpaired t test, n = 6 independent
  experiments, mean ± SEM). (B, D) Representative Western blotting of the indicated
  proteins in HBEC spheroids grown and treated as in (B). (E) SOX2 mRNA level in HBEC
  spheroids grown and treated as in (B). **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 (unpaired t test, n
  = 4 independent experiments, mean ± SEM).Source data are available for this figure.
