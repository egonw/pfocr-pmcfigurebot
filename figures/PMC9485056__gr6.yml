caption: Carbon dioxide–derived oxidants in the macrophage phagosome. Engulfment of
  pathogens in the phagosome leads to a series of metabolic events directed to cause
  oxidative killing of the invader microbial cell. In this regard, activation of NOX
  leads to the formation of O2•- and H2O2 and in the case of immunostimulated cells,
  the concomitant generation of •NO and peroxynitrite. These processes are coupled
  with the activation of the PPP that generates NADPH for the catalytic action of
  NOX and NOS and CO2 that can diffuse inside the phagosomal lumen and contribute
  to the formation of HCO4- and ONOOCO2−. At the same time, membrane-bound ATP-dependent
  pumps release H+ toward the phagosome causing a drop in pH. NOS, nitric oxide synthase;
  NOX, NADPH oxidase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
