caption: Global transcriptional changes in uninfected wild-type Col-0 (WT), knock-out
  plant VQ28KO12, and overexpression line VQ28OE9. (A) Number of genes in A. thaliana
  uninfected leaves. The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed the
  overlap of genes up-regulated in VQ28OE9 and down-regulated in VQ28KO12 compared
  with WT (left), and the overlap of genes down-regulated in VQ28OE9 and up-regulated
  in VQ28KO12 compared with WT (right). (B) KEGG pathway map analysis showed DEGs,
  mainly in MAPK signaling pathway and plant hormone signal transduction. The sizes
  and colors of the dots indicate the numbers of DEGs and the q-value, respectively.
  (C) The distribution showed the 11 overlapping genes up-regulated in VQ28OE9 but
  down-regulated in VQ28KO12; six of them responded to abscisic acid.
