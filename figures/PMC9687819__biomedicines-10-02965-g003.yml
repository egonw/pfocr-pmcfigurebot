caption: 'Effect of HPV proteins on IFN production and the ISG pathway. When the cell
  senses viral DNA, signaling pathways are triggered to produce IFN; then, the binding
  of IFN to its receptors activates the ISG pathway to control viral infection. (a)
  HPV proteins affect IFN production: E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with TLR and
  cGAS receptors and also with transcriptional factors such as IRF-3 and -1 that block
  IFN production. In addition, E1 protein prevents the expression of IFN-β and IFN-λ;
  however, the mechanisms of such regulation are still unclear. (b) The production
  of IFN promotes the activation of the ISG pathway; however, HPV proteins prevent
  its activation by acting at various levels of regulation of the pathway. However,
  it is not known if the inhibition of IFN is enough to prevent the activation of
  ISGs or whether other components such as STAT1 and STAT2 could be regulated by these
  proteins. IFN, interferon; IFNAR, IFN-α receptor; IFNGR, IFN-γ receptor; IFNLR,
  IFN-λ receptor; IRF9, interferon regulatory factor 9; ISGF3, interferon stimulated
  gene factor 3; ISRE, interferon stimulated response element; GAS, gamma interferon
  activation site. Figure created using BioRENDER.com.'
