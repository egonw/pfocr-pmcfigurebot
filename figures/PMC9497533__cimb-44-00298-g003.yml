caption: Evodiamine stimulates induction of PARP cleavage and the cleavage of caspase-3
  and caspase-7 in AGS and MKN45 cell. Indicated doses of evodiamine (0, 1, 5 and
  10 μM) for 24 h were applied to (A) AGS and (B) MKN45 cells. A total of 10 μM evodiamine
  for the indicated time periods (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) was applied to (C) AGS and (D)
  MKN45 cells. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot to evaluate the levels
  of PARP, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9. β-actin was used as
  an internal control. EVD, evodiamine.
