caption: 'Roles of LY294002 in the expressing apoptotic proteins in GC SGC7901 cells.
  (a) Western blot was used to detect the effect of LY294002 on apoptosis-related
  protein expression of GASTRIC cancer SGC7901 cells. (b) Histogram of Bax protein
  expression. (c) Histogram of Bcl-2 protein expression. (d) Histogram of c-Cas3 protein
  expression. (e) Histogram of c-Cas9 protein expression. âˆ—P < 0.05 in contrast to
  the controls, #P < 0.05 in contrast to the IL-8 group.'
