caption: The role of Aurora-A in human cancer hallmarks and cancer acquired resistance.
  (A) Aurora-A plays multiple roles in regulating tumor development and progression
  by facilitating cell-cycle progression, activating cell survival and anti-apoptosis
  or necroptosis signaling, inducing genomic instability, epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). In recent studies, some novel cancer hallmarks
  have been found to regulate tumor progression associated with Aurora-A kinase; (B)
  Mechanisms of Aurora-A-mediated cancer acquired resistance. Aurora-A kinase on producing
  the resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy via modulating
  DNA damage repair, feedback activation bypass pathway, apoptosis, metastasis, stemness
  and autophagy.
