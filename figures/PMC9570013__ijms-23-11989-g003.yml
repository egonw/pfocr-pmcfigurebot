caption: Interaction between GGCT and MRPL9. (A) The Starbase database (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/index.php,
  accessed on 22 March 2022) analyzed the correlation between GGCT and MRPL9 in thyroid
  cancer. (B) Immunofluorescence assays explored the localization of MRPL9 and GGCT
  in cells (scar bar = 5 µm). (C) Representative image of the localization of MRPL9
  and GGCT detected by immunofluorescence homologous double labeling experiments on
  paraffin sections (Left figure, scar bar = 20 µm; Right figure, scar bar = 5 µm).
  (D) GGCT was overexpressed/knocked down in K1/BCPAP cells, and the protein expression
  level of MRPL9 was detected by Western blot. (E) The expression levels of GGCT and
  MRPL9 in the K1 cell line were analyzed with image J, and normalized to Actin (n
  = 3). (F) The expression levels of GGCT and MRPL9 in the BCPAP cell line were analyzed
  with image J, and normalized to Actin (n = 3). (G) The interaction between GGCT
  and MRPL9 was analyzed by Co-IP in K1/BCPAP cells. Measurement data (mean ± standard
  deviation) between two groups were compared by paired t test. “*” represents p ≤
  0.05.
