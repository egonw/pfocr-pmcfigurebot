caption: 'RIP140 inhibits G6PD gene expression at the transcriptional level. (A,B)
  mRNA expression of the indicated genes was quantified by RT-qPCR in MEF WT or RIP140
  knock-out (RIPKO) (values are normalized to WT samples) (A) and in MDA-MB-436 transfected
  with control siRNA (siC) or RIP140 siRNAs (siRIP#1; siRIP#2). Values are normalized
  to control siRNA samples (B). Name of the genes: G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PGD: 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase; RPE: ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase; RPIA:
  ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A; TALDO1: transaldolase 1; TKT: transketolase. (C)
  G6pd mRNA expression level was assessed by RT-qPCR in MEF WT or RIP140 knock-out
  (RIPKO) overexpressing GFP or human RIP140 (hRIP140). The values are normalized
  to WT-GFP samples. (D) Luciferase activity assays were conducted in MDA-MB-436 cells
  transfected with a G6PD-Luc reporter gene, the luciferase reporter TK-Renilla, and
  in increasing concentrations of RIP140 siRNA (siRIP#1). Luciferase values were normalized
  to the Renilla luciferase control and to the values of samples transfected with
  control siRNA (−). (E) Luciferase activity assay in MEF WT or RIPKO transfected
  with a G6PD-Luc reporter gene, the luciferase reporter TK-Renilla and increasing
  concentrations of a RIP140-expressing plasmid. Luciferase values were normalized
  to the Renilla luciferase control. All experiments were conducted at least three
  times. Values are means ± SEM; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns = not
  significant.'
