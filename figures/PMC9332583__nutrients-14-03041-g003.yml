caption: Expression levels of the flagellin recognition receptor TLR5 and its potential
  transcription factor in the control, DSS and DSS + R. I groups treated mice. (A)
  Expression levels of TLR5, Sp1, and Sp3 in the three groups as determined by RTâ€“qPCR
  analysis. (B) Correlation analysis between TLR5 and Sp3 in the three groups. (C)
  Correlation analysis between TLR5 and Sp1 in the three groups. (D) Representative
  images of TLR5 and Sp3 immunohistochemical staining in colon sections from the three
  groups. (E) Representative Western blot analysis showing TLR5 and Sp3 in colon sections
  from the three groups. Control vs. DSS, Control vs. DSS + R. I, and DSS vs. DSS
  + R. I; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
