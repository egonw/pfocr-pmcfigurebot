figure_title: WEE2-AS1 mediates the proteasomal degradation of MOB1A and inhibits
  the Hippo pathway
caption: A HCT 116 and HT-29 cells are transfected with increasing amounts of MOB1A
  overexpression or knockdown plasmids, and endogenous protein levels of MOB1A were
  determined by WB. B Immunoblotting showing reversion of MOB1A protein levels by
  proteasome inhibitor MG132 in the WEE2-AS1 knockdown or overexpression HCT 116 and
  HT-29 cells. C, D Immunoblotting showing the effect of WEE2-AS1 expression changes
  on MOB1A protein stability in the HCT 116 and HT-29 cells treated with 100 μg/ml
  cycloheximide (CHX) for indicated times. E Representative western blot analyses
  of Hippo signaling pathway factors pMST1, MST1, pLATS1, LATS1, pYAP, YAP, c-MYC,
  cyclin D1, and CDK4 using specific antibodies through gain or loss of function of
  WEE2-AS1 in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. GAPDH acts as an internal reference. F Level
  of YAP detected by WB in cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction. YY1 was used as a nuclear
  internal reference, and GAPDH was used as a plasma reference. G Working model for
  WEE2-AS1 inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments.
