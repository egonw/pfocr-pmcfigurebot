caption: Myc promoted SIRT4 degradation to reduce ADP ribosylation of MAT2A in the
  HCC. A Protein levels of c-Myc, MAT2A and MARylation level of MAT2A were determined
  by western blot from 85 pairs of tumour tissues. In the inserted boxplots, the circles
  indicate the median; the square indicate the 5th–95th percentiles. The statistical
  analysis was performed by the two tailed Student’s t-test (**p < 0.01). B Correlation
  between Myc and SIRT4 in HCC patients. 85 tissue pairs were immunohistochemically
  stained with indicated antibodies. The pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficient
  and the corresponding p-value between two genes were calculated. C The patients
  with high SIRT4 expression (n = 43) have longer survival compared to low SIRT4 expression
  (n = 42). Significance was determined using Kaplan–Meier analysis. D Schematic showing
  that high methionine content is sensed by mTORC1 that triggers c-Myc expression,
  which promotes TRIM32-mediated SIRT4 degradation. SIRT4 regulates MAT2A activity
  through MARylation, thereby inhibits MAT2A mediated tumour growth. SIRT4 loss resulted
  in the low MARylation level of MAT2A, which promotes methionine metabolism to generate
  SAM. In a feedback, high SAM level triggers transcription of metabolic enzymes to
  maintain tumour progression. Upward pointing arrows indicate an increase, and downwards
  pointing arrows indicate a decrease
