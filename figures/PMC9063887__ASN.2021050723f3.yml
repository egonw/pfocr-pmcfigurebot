caption: 'RNA sequencing of APOL1G0/G0 and APOL1G2/G2 kidney organoids reveals differences
  in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. (A) Principal component analysis
  of RNA sequencing samples. (B) The 20 most upregulated and 20 most downregulated
  coding genes differentially expressed in IFN-γ treated APOL1G0/G0 and APOL1G2/G2
  organoids. The heatmap was sorted by logFC with gene expression scale normalized
  by Z-score. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis (Metacore) generated with differentially
  expressed genes with FDR <0.05. The pathways were considered upregulated or downregulated
  based on the gene expression patterns within the pathway. The differentially regulated
  pathways included both upregulated and downregulated genes. (D) Volcano plots highlighting
  selected genes grouped by biologic process. The horizontal dotted line represents
  the FDR cutoff of <0.05. The two vertical lines represent log2 fold change ±1. (E)
  Bioinformatic prediction of protein-protein interactions between APOL1 and differentially
  expressed lipid metabolism genes using the STRING algorithm. The different colored
  nodes represent first shell interactions clustered by K-means; the dashed lines
  connect the three different clusters (green, red, blue). The network edges (solid
  lines) represent functional associations (not necessarily indicative of binding).
  The network enrichment P value was <0.001. The top three gene ontology terms were
  “malonyl-CoA biosynthetic process,” “negative regulation of receptor biosynthetic
  process,” and “chylomicron remodeling.” (F) GeneMANIA function-specific association
  network via a binary classification algorithm. Input genes: APOL1, FASN, MGLL, FABP4,
  FITM1, ACLY, ACSS2, ACSL3, ACSL4, and CPT1. The molecular function-based weighting
  method predicted the genes represented in the outer circle. The edge colors represent
  type of association: physical interaction, coexpression, predicted, pathway, or
  colocalization. The colored nodes indicate predicted biologic functions of each
  gene node.'
