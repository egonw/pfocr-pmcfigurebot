figure_title: RHBDL2 interacts with Notch1 and mediates the cleavage of Notch 1 and
  release of Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD)
caption: 'A Silver staining assay was performed to detect the differential protein
  bands. B, C Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay of RHBDL2 and Notch1 in PC cells. Immunofluorescent
  (IF) staining assay presented the co-localization of RHBDL2 and Notch1 (D) and the
  distribution of Notch1 (E), respectively. Scale bar: 10 μm. F N1ICD’s domain organization
  and N1ICD truncations’ scheme, followed by IP assay. G The level of cleaved Notch1
  was determined by Western blot assay. H IP assay detected the N1ICD level in the
  indicated PC cells. Flag-RHBDL2: RHBDL2 wild-type group; Flag-RHBDL2-SA: a serine
  to alanine (SA) catalytic mutant of RHBDL2.'
article_title: RHBDL2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
