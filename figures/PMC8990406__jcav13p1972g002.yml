caption: Silence of METTL3 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC
  cell lines. (A) Left and right panel showed the expression level of METTL3 in KYSE150
  and KYSE170 cell lines transfected with siMETTL3 or siControl determined by qRT-PCR
  and western blot. (B) Cell proliferation ability and colony formation ability of
  KYSE150 and KYSE170 cells transfected with siMETTL3 or siControl were evaluated
  by MTS assay and colony formation assay. (C-D) Cell migration and invasion abilities
  of KYSE150 and KYSE170 cells transfected with siMETTL3 or siControl were evaluated
  by wound healing experiment, transwell migration and matrigel invasion assay. All
  data are presented as the mean Â± SDs (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
