caption: Defects of pollen walls and tapetum in ospdt1 anthers detected by electron
  microscopy. A–N and P–S, TEM analysis; (O) and (T) SEM analysis. A, C, D, and E,
  Microspores obtained from the WT at Stages 8b, 9, 10, and 11, respectively. F, H,
  I, and J, Microspores obtained from ospdt1 at Stages 8b, 9, 10, and 11, respectively.
  B and G, Higher magnification views of the white boxed region in (A) and (F), respectively.
  K, L, and N Tapetum obtained from the WT at Stages 9, 10, and 11, respectively.
  P, Q, and S, Tapetum obtained from the ospdt1 at Stages 9, 10, and 11, respectively.
  M and R, Higher magnification views of the white boxed region in (L) and (Q), respectively.
  O and T, Microspores obtained from WT and ospdt1 anthers at Stage 14, respectively.
  The deeply stained materials are indicated by white arrows. The white line spans
  the width of the tapetum. Ba, bacula; dM, degraded microspore; dTe, disordered tectum;
  dNe, disordered nexine; dBa, disordered bacula; Msp, microspore; Ne, nexine; In,
  intine; Nu, nucleus; T, tapetum; Te, tectum; PM, plasma membrane; UPM, undulated
  plasma membrane; U, Ubisch body. Bars, 2 µm in (A), (F), (K), (L), (N), (P), (Q),
  and (S); 0.5 µm in (B)–(E), (G)–(J), (M), and (R); and 10 µm in (O) and (T).
