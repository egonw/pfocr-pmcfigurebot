caption: 'Srk1 kinase is involved in Sty1 inactivation after stress response. (a)
  Total extracts from growing cultures of wild-type, srk1Δ and srk1-KA (catalytically
  inactive srk1) strains, either untreated (0 min) or treated with 1 M KCl at the
  indicated times, were resolved in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting. Blot
  membranes were cut prior antibodies incubation, Activated Sry1 (Sty1-P), corresponding
  to Sty1 phosphorylated at Thr171 and Tyr173 was detected with an anti-phospho p38
  antibody and total Sty1 protein was detected with anti-HOG1 antibody. (b) Srk1 overexpressed
  (+ OP Srk1) through the activation of the inducible nmt promoter of the plasmid
  pREP1-srk1:HA6his in the absence of thiamine (−B1) during 20 h or repressed (−OP
  Srk1) by adding thiamine (pREP-srk1:HA6his + B1) in wild-type cells, untreated or
  treated with 1 mM H2O2 and 1 M KCl for 15 min. Activated (Sty1-P) and total Sty1
  were detected with anti-phospho p38 and anti-HOG1 antibodies, respectively. Level
  of overexpressed Srk1 was detected with anti-HA antibody. Lane C, indicates a control
  which correspond to untreated wild-type cells. (c) cdc25-9A cells with (+) or without
  (−) Srk1 overexpression for 20 h (OP Srk1: pREP1-srk1:HA6his –B1) and untreated
  or treated with 0.8 M KCl for 15 min. Activated and total Sty1 were detected with
  anti-phospho p38 and anti-HOG1 antibodies, respectively. Level of overexpressed
  Srk1 was detected with anti-HA antibody. (d) S. pombe wild-type and Δsrk1 cells
  expressing genomic sty1:HA were untreated (0 min) or treated with 0.8 M KCl at the
  indicated times (min). Activated and total Sty1 were detected with anti-phospho
  p38 and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. Sty1:HA was immunoprecipitated from each
  time point, and Sty1 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with anti-phospho-tyrosine
  antibody (middle panel). Blot membranes were cut prior antibodies incubation.'
