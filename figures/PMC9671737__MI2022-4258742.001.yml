caption: 'ST3GAL3 was upregulated in RA tissues and cell lines. (a) ST3GAL3 was an
  overlapping gene screened from GSE101193 and GSE94519 datasets. (b) ST3GAL3 was
  significantly highly expressed in the PBMCs of RA patients in contrast to normal
  controls in GSE101193 dataset. (c, d) The qRT-PCR and (e, f) western blotting results
  showed that the expression of ST3GAL3 was increased with prolonged IL-1β and TNF-α
  treatments in MH7A cells. n = 3. ns: no significance; ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  compared with the expression of ST3GAL3 at 0 h.'
