caption: (a) UMAP plot showing contribution of each AGM sample (CS14–15, 4.5–5 weeks)
  (n=3 biologically independent samples) to hemato-vascular clusters. (b) Dot plot
  showing HOXA expression in AGM hematovascular cells. (c) Pseudotime analysis of
  833 cells from clusters 0–5 (endothelium and HSC). (d,e) Pseudotime trajectory plots
  showing the progression of pseudotime variable (d) and contribution of each AGM
  sample to trajectory (e). (f) Feature plots displaying the expression of markers
  of the different stages of EHT in pseudotime trajectory plot. (g) Heatmap displaying
  unsupervised clustering of 11514 genes whose expression significantly changes over
  pseudotime, divided into 10 gene groups. (h) Summary table of enriched GO categories
  from each gene group (Fisher’s exact test). (i-k) Dot plots showing endothelial
  and hematopoietic lineage genes (i), cell cycle and metabolism-related genes (j)
  and signaling pathway associated genes (k) identified from pseudotime analysis,
  in clusters 0–8 and HE. HE is highlighted in blue.
