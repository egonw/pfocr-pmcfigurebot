caption: 'Effect of CDCQ on eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and NO production. a Cells
  were treated with 5–20 µM CDCQ for 90 min or pretreated with 100 µM l -NAME for
  1 h and then 20 µM CDCQ for 90 min. NO was assayed using DAF-2 DA. Cells were treated
  with 20 µM CDCQ for 10–120 min (b) or 5–20 µM CDCQ for 60 min (c) and assessed by
  Western blotting. *Significantly different from the control at p < 0.01. #Significantly
  different from CDCQ-treated cells at p < 0.01'
