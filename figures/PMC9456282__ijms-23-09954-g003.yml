caption: Effect of caffeine on the TLR4/MAPK pathway of hepatic tissue from the NASH
  model. Protein levels of TLR4 (A), ERK (B), JNK (C), p38 (D), p-ERK (E), p-JNK (F),
  and p-p38 (G) in the hepatic tissues from rats in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine,
  and caffeine groups were determined using western blot analysis. Bars represent
  the mean of experiments performed in duplicate ± SEM (n = 3); β-actin was used as
  a loading control. p-ERK/ERK (H), p-JNK/JNK (I), and p-p38/p38 (J) ratios. Values
  are shown as a fold increment in optical density normalized to control group values
  (control = 1). Bars represent the mean of experiments performed in duplicate ± SEM.
  (a) p < 0.05 compared with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4
  group.
