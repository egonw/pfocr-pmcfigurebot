caption: Effects of lenvatinib on signal transduction pathway in various thyroid cancer
  cell lines. Expression and phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and Akt in six thyroid
  cancer cell lines 24 h after treatment with indicated concentrations of lenvatinib
  were analyzed by western blot. α‐tubulin was used as a loading control and 10 μg/lane
  proteins were loaded. Representative images of western blots (upper panels). The
  relative phosphorylation levels are disclosed below each protein band. Quantitative
  data (relative phosphorylation levels) from triplicate experiments are presented
  as bar chart (lower panels) (*P < 0.05)
