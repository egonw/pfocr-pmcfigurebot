caption: 'A simplified scheme of the main Hippo pathway kinases and effectors and
  the modulating effects from main cellular metabolism regulators. Only core components
  of interest in our study are shown in colored shapes. The effectors YAP and TAZ
  are inactivated after LATS1/2-facilitated phosphorylation or, alternatively, enter
  the nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors activating the expression of
  genes related to cell growth. Low levels of glucose, acetyl-CoA, and MFAs favor
  YAP/TAZ inactivation through the AMPK, HMGCR-RhoA, and SCD1-Wnt-β-catenin pathways,
  respectively. Abbreviations: YAP, Yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ-binding motif; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HMGCR, HMG-CoA reductase;
  RhoA, Ras Homolog Family Member A; SCD1, Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase 1; MFAs, monounsaturated
  fatty acids.'
