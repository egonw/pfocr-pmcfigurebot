caption: PD activated platelets without additional Ca2+. (a) The calcium kinetic curves
  of the human platelets. (b) The effect of PD on [Ca2+]i of human platelets at peak.
  (c) The effect of PD on ATP release of platelets. (d) The effect of PD on P-selectin
  (CD62P) of human washed platelets. (e) The effect of PD on PAC-1 of human washed
  platelets. The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared to the vehicle group.
