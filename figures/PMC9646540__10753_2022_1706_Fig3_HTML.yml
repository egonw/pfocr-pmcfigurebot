caption: 'Matching of the substrates utilized by Winnie (WN) and wild-type C57BL/6
  (WT) mice microbial communities in the Biolog EcoPlates with the substrates that
  were associated with the most abundant bacterial species (> 1%) in the WT and WN
  gut microbiota by consulting the MetaCyc Metabolic Pathway Database (https://metacyc.org/).
  The green box means that substrate is used, and the red box means that substrate
  is not used by bacterial species. The following species are not listed in the MetaCyc
  database: Falsiporphyromonas endometrii, Flintibacter butyricus, Anaeroplasma bactoclasticum
  and Bacteroides acidifaciens. The following substrates are not used by any of the
  bacteria listed in MetaCyc database and are not shown in the figure: D-Galactonic
  Acid γ-Lactone, Pyruvic Acid Methyl Ester, Itaconic Acid, D-Malic Acid, Phenylethylamine,
  Tween 40, α-cyclodextrin and Tween 80. Aminobutyric acid is not included in the
  MetaCyc Metabolic Pathway Database.'
