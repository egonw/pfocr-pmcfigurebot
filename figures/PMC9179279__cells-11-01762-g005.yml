caption: Tumor cells with copy number losses in multiple autophagy genes maintain
  clonogenic growth under metabolic stress. (a,b) Quantitative clonogenic growth assay.
  (a) Representative images. (b) Colony number in % of untreated cells. Shown is the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). Differential treatment responses were tested for statistical
  significance by 2-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. p-values denote
  pairwise comparisons of mutant with wild-type cells; ***, p < 0.0001; and *, p <
  0.01. (c,d) Clonogenic growth under increasing doses of (c) DCA and (d) 2DG. UN,
  untreated.
