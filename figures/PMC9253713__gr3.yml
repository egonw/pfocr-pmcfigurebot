caption: SUFU downregulates YAP activity(A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
  YAP target gene set upon knockdown of SUFU in HCC1954 cells. Gene symbols of the
  YAP common MCF10 and 3T3_Zhao gene set and detailed information on GSEA results
  were provided in . AXL, as a YAP-dependent target gene, was highlighted in the display.(B
  and C) Immunoblot (IB) analysis of AXL and ACSL4 abundance upon SUFU depletion in
  HCC1954, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells (B). A rescue experiment was performed by ectopic
  expression of a V5-tagged SUFU construct in SUFU-depleted cells (C). GAPDH as a
  loading control. Numbers indicate the normalized ratio of ACSL4 or AXL over GAPDH
  signals obtained by densitometric analysis.(D) Expression of TEAD luciferase reporter
  in SUFU-depleted MCF-7 and HCC1954 cells and their respective control cells. Cells
  were transfected with the 8xGTIIC-luciferase reporter and pRL-TK Renilla luciferase.
  Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. Data were normalized to vector
  control.(E) Confocal analysis of YAP nuclear localization in SUFU-depleted HCC1954
  (left panels) and SUFU-depleted MCF-7 (right panels) cells; scale bar, 50μm.(F and
  G) IB analysis of P-YAP127 and total YAP levels in SUFU-overexpressed HCC1954 and
  MDA-MB-231 cells (F), in SUFU-depleted HCC1954, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells (G).
  Densitometric analysis of the normalized ratio of P-YAP127 over total YAP signals
  was shown. Data are presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).
