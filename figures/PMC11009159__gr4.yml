caption: Biosynthesis of phenolic phytoalexins in response to γ-irradiation treatment
  or Xoo infection.(A) Structure of phenolic phytoalexins (sakuranetin, CinTyr, BenTrp,
  CinTrp, CouSer) in rice.(B) Quantification of sakuranetin content (μmol g−1 FW)
  in rice leaves of ku70 and atm-1 mutants with their WTs (DJ and GLA4) under normal
  growth or at 36 h post-γ-irradiation (40 Gy).(C) Heatmaps of liquid chromatography–mass
  spectrometry data for four phenylamides (CinTyr, BenTrp, CinTrp, and CouSer) in
  leaves of ku70 and atm-1 mutants and DJ seedlings under normal growth or at 36 h
  post-γ-irradiation (40 Gy). Increases and decreases in metabolite levels (μmol g−1
  FW) are shown in yellow and blue, respectively.(D) Quantification of phenolic phytoalexins
  in leaves of atm-3, ku70, and TOP6A3-OE1 lines and their WTs (ZH11, DJ, and K3)
  after 60 h of ZJ173 infection.(E) Biosynthesis kinetics of sakuranetin and CinTyr
  in rice leaves during 24–60 h of ZJ173 infection.Data are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗∗,
  significant difference compared with WTs, P < 0.05 as calculated by one-way ANOVA.
  6A3-OE1, TOP6A3-overexpressing line.
