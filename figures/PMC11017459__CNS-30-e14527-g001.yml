caption: Icaritin restores the expression of genes in energy metabolism. (A–C) In
  glycolysis, heatmap analysis of the transcriptome data of the expression of enzymatic
  genes directly involved in glycolysis (A), gene description (B), and qRT‐PCR verification
  (C). (D–F) In the TCA cycle, heatmap analysis of the transcriptome data of the expression
  of enzymatic genes directly involved in TCA cycle (D), gene description (E), and
  qRT‐PCR verification (F). (G–I) In oxidative phosphorylation, heatmap analysis of
  the transcriptome data of the expression of genes directly encoding important components
  of Complex I and ATP synthetase (G), gene description (H), and qRT‐PCR verification
  (I). (J–L) In the pentose phosphate pathway, heatmap analysis of the transcriptome
  data of the expression of enzymatic genes directly involved in pentose phosphate
  pathway (J), gene description (K), and qRT‐PCR verification (L). (M–O) In fatty
  acid β‐oxidation, heatmap analysis of the transcriptome data of the expression of
  enzymatic genes directly involved in fatty acid β‐oxidation (M), gene description
  (N), and qRT‐PCR verification (O). WT1, WT2, and WT3 represent three independent
  wild‐type groups; AD1, AD2, and AD3 represent three independent Aβarc expression
  groups; ICT1, ICT2, and ICT3 represent three independent Aβarc expression plus Icaritin
  30 μM treatment groups. Error bars represent the SD of four independent experiments.
  NS represents not significant. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.005, and ****p ≤ 0.001
  use a one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test.
