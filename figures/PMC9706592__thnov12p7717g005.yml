caption: 'Rs modulates the levels of MARCH1 and CMIP in DCs. Naïve mice and AAD mice
  (n = 6 per group) were treated with Rs or sham Rs (sham, in short) for two weeks.
  DCs were isolated from the airway tissues. A, volcano plots show relevant DEGs in
  DCs. B, the levels of MARCH1 mRNA in DCs. C, immunoblots show MARCH1 protein in
  DCs. D, boxplots show the integrated density of the immunoblots of MARCH1. E, immunoblots
  show CMIP levels in DCs. F, boxplots show integrated density of CMIP blots in panel
  E. G, paired point plots show correlation between MARCH1 and CMIP blot density.
  Abbreviations: Rs: Restraint stress. DC: Dendritic cell. Rs: Restraint stress. DEG:
  Differentially expressed gene. CMIP: c-Maf inducing protein. NC: Naïve control mice.
  Density: Integrated density of immunoblot.'
