caption: Graphical workflow of the analytical pipeline adopted in this work. (A) RNA-Seq
  based gene expression profiles of lung epithelial cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  bronchial epithelial cells for asthma and ASM cells for vitamin D deficiency were
  collected. (B) Differential expression analyses among all pair-wise conditions were
  conducted, which resulted shared Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) among all
  pair-wise conditions involving SARS-CoV-2 infection, asthma and vitamin D deficiency.
  (C) Functional enrichment analysis was conducted for the shared DEGs for Gene Ontology
  (GO) and pathway databases to assess the biological significance of those shared
  DEGs. (D) Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network-based analysis, gene-disease
  association and regulatory factors were conducted to identify potential therapeutic
  targets, possible comorbidities and prognostic molecular check-points, respectively.
