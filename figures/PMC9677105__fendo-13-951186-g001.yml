caption: 'Potential interaction between meal-related gastrointestinal signals and
  estradiol on control of the body weight in women. Meal-related gastrointestinal
  signals (CCK, GLP-1, others) act through a paracrine-neuronal pathway (shown in
  purple and red). These meal-related gastrointestinal signals act paracrinally upon
  vagal afferent neurons (VAN). The VANs activate secondary neurons located in the
  NTS, in the brainstem. The NTS integrates a variety of peripheral signals, and in
  turn activates tertiary neurons located in different nuclei in the hypothalamus.
  These hypothalamic nuclei control feeding behavior. Circulating estradiol (shown
  in green) modulates the responsiveness to these gastrointestinal satiety signals
  by acting on all levels of this paracrine-neuronal pathway: The VAN, NTS and the
  hypothalamic nuclei. Gastrointestinal satiety signals also act directly upon the
  hypothalamic nuclei through a hormonal pathway (shown in purple). Additionally,
  estradiol (green) has a direct anorexigenic effect at the level of the hypothalamic
  nuclei (PVH, LH and ARC), thereby reducing food intake. Metabolic signals such as
  insulin and leptin also influence centers in the hypothalamus to regulate body weight.
  Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis contributes to regulation of body weight
  by increasing energy expenditure. Estradiol acts all three points of the VMH-SNS-BAT
  pathway to increase thermogenesis. Within the VMH hypothalamic nucleus, estradiol
  acts by inhibiting AMPK. Thus, estradiol increases energy expenditure by increasing
  BAT thermogenesis, and WAT browning. This, in combination with estradiol’s effects
  to decrease food intake, can result in weight loss. NST, nucleus of the solitary
  tract; DMH, dorsomedial hypothalamus; LH, lateral hypothalamus; PVH, paraventricular
  hypothalamus; ARC, arcuate nucleus; VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus; BAT, brown adipose
  tissue; WAT, white adipose tissue.'
