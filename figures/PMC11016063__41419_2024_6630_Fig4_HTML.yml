figure_title: A PrPC-CCR5 pathway mediates αSyn-induced rod formation
caption: 'A Rod index quantification (fold change relative to control) of DIV14 hippocampal
  neurons expressing GFP or αSyn either with pmRFP-N1 (empty) or cofilin-S3E. Data
  represent mean±SEM (n = 4–6 independent samples/condition with an average of 25
  neurons/sample). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by One-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test. B Quantification of the percentage of neurons with rods (fold
  change relative to control) in DIV7 hippocampal neurons from WT or PrPC KO mice
  expressing GFP or αSyn. Data represent mean±SEM (n = 4–6 independent samples/condition
  with ≥100 neurons/sample). **p < 0.01 by Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison
  test. C Quantification of the percentage of neurons with rods in DIV7 hippocampal
  neurons expressing GFP or αSyn and pre-treated for 24 h with 50 nM Maraviroc. Data
  represent mean±SEM (n = 3 independent experiments with ≥100 neurons/condition/experiment).
  *p < 0.05 by One-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. D Representative
  images of DIV7 hippocampal neurons expressing GFP or αSyn and pre-treated for 24 h
  with 50 pM RAP-103. Immunostaining for β3-tubulin (red) and cofilin (white). Scale
  bar: 20 μm. Arrowheads indicate rod structures. E Quantification of the percentage
  of neurons with rods (shown as fold change relative to control) relative to D. Data
  represent mean ± SEM. (n = 3 independent experiments with ≥100 neurons/condition/experiment).
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 by One-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test. F Quantification of the rod index in DIV6 hippocampal neurons overexpressing
  PrPC and pre-treated with 50 pM RAP103 for 24 h. Data represent mean±SEM (n = 3
  independent samples/condition with ≥100 neurons/sample). ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
  by One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. G Representative images
  of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells expressing GFP or αSyn and immunostained for cofilin
  (red) and βIII-tubulin (blue). Scale bar: 10 μm. H qPCR results for CCR5, PRNP and
  GAPDH gene expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. ACTB was used as a reference
  gene. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
  by Student’s t test. I Schematic representation of the signaling pathway of αSyn-induced
  cofilin-actin rod formation in hippocampal neurons.'
