figure_title: Chemoresistant cells communicate through distinct signaling pathways
  which is enhanced following exposure to chemotherapy
caption: (A) UMAP clusters of scRNA-seq datasets of primary TNBC tumors. (B) Circle
  plot showing number of interactions between the cell types in primary TNBC scRNA-seq
  dataset. (C) Cell–cell communication of the epithelial cells including basal epithelial
  with other cell types within TNBC spatial transcriptome dataset. The line and its
  width represent the strength of the cellular communications between the cell types
  on the histological section. (D) Circle plot showing key signaling pathways involved
  in intercellular communications between the basal and other cell types in TNBC.
  (E) Bar plot showing ligand-receptor interaction of LAMININ signaling pathway for
  intercellular communication in TNBC. (F, G) UMAP plot of post chemotherapy-treated
  chemoresistance and chemosensitive cells. (H) Bar plot showing the total number
  of interactions in the resistant and sensitive group of cells. (I) Circle plot showing
  the number of interactions between the cell types in chemosensitive and chemoresistant
  datasets. (J) Plot shows key signaling pathways enriched in chemoresistant and chemosensitive
  cells. (K) Circle plot showing the number of interactions of the intercellular signaling
  pathway in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells. .
