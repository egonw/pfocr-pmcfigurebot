caption: A proposed pathway to regulate phosphorylation of uS5 Ser176. We propose
  a provisional pathway to explain our data on the regulation of phosphorylation of
  uS5 Ser176. The bold, roman lettering indicates parts of the proposed pathway that
  we have demonstrated whereas the italic lettering indicates predicted intermediates
  in the pathway for which direct evidence has not been provided. Arrows indicate
  positive interactions and blunt arrows indicate negative interactions. For example,
  Ypk2 is proposed to promote phosphorylation of uS5 Ser176 and Hog1 is proposed to
  inhibit TORC1. The arrows should not be interpreted as indicating direct actions
  since intermediate steps may be missing. Asterisks indicate phosphorylation by a
  kinase (e.g. Ypk2 promoting phosphorylation of uS5 Ser176). A ‘t’ on an arrow indicates
  transcriptional activation of the downstream target gene. Dotted arrows indicate
  drug or small molecule activation (arrow) or inhibition (blunt arrow) of the indicated
  protein.
