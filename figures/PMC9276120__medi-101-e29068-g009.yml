caption: The GSEA analysis demonstrated that the high-risk group were enriched in
  the process of cell cycle, homologous recombination, P53 signaling pathway, pancreatic
  cancer, pentose phosphate pathway, small cell lung cancer, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis
  (A), while the low-risk group were enriched in basal cell carcinoma, calcium signaling
  pathway, fatty acid metabolism (B). GSEA = gene set enrichment analysis, KEGG =
  Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.
