caption: 'Neurochemical and biochemical mechanisms mediating 5-HT6 receptor functions.
  In addition to the activation of cAMP signalling pathways, 5-HT6 receptors activate
  the extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) via Fyn-dependent pathway.
  The proposed neurochemical circuitry for 5-HT6 receptors to influence cognition
  involves modulation of cholinergic and/or glutamatergic activity through GABAergic
  interneurons. AC: adenylate cyclase; ACH: acetylcholine; Glut: glutamate. (+): stimulation;
  (—): inhibition. (adapted and modified from []).'
