caption: Identification of downstream target proteins of lncDBET in BCa. (A) The work
  flow diagram of ChIRP/MS used to screen the downstream target proteins of lncDBET
  in BCa (Referring to Yuxing Zhu's figure). (B) Downstream candidates of lncDBET
  by ChIRP/MS (|FC| ≥ 2, P < 0.05). (C) KEGG pathway analysis of possible signaling
  pathways that lncDBET may be involved in. (D) MS-identified peptide sequence of
  FABP5. (E) FABP5-RIP-qPCR analysis of lncDBET regulated by FABP5 in EJ-M3 and J82
  cell lines. (F) qPCR assay analysis of FABP5 expression in BCa tissues. (G) Western
  blotting analysis of FABP5 in six paired cancer and adjacent normal tissues of BCa.
  β-Actin was used as the control. (H) Immunohistochemistry assay analysis of FABP5
  expression in two paired cancer and adjacent normal tissues of BCa. Each experiment
  was repeated a minimum of three times. The symbol * denotes a significant difference
  (P < 0.05), while ** represents a highly significant difference (P < 0.01).
