figure_title: CKS2 regulates cancer-associated PI3K–AKT signaling pathway
caption: A Volcano plot of gene-level expression changes after CKS2 knockdown. The
  orange and green dots represent genes with an at least two-fold increase or decrease
  in expression level in CKS2-KD cells compared with control cells. B Heatmap of log2-transformed
  expression profiles for DEGs compared CKS2-KD cells with control cells. Orange and
  blue denote increased and decreased expression, respectively. C GO enrichment analysis
  for all DEGs showed in (C). D Western blotting validations of PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling
  pathway-associated proteins in CKS2-KD and CKS2-Rescue cells compared with corresponding
  control Y79 cells. E Western blotting was used to validate the knockdown of PTEN
  in CKS2 down-regulated Y79 cells. F–H Knockdown of PTEN in CKS2 down-regulated Y79
  cells reversed cell proliferation (F), colony formation (G) and EdU staining assay
  (H, Representative images at left panel and quantification of percent EdU+ cells
  at right panel, shown as mean ± SEM, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n ≥ 3). I Western
  blotting was used to validate expression of PTEN in E2F1 knockdown Y79 cells. J
  Lentivirus overexpression of PTEN (PTEN-OE) in Y79 cells was validated by Western
  blotting. GAPDH served as the internal control. K, L Colony formation assay (K)
  and EdU staining assay (L; Representative images at left panel and quantification
  of percent EdU+ cells at right panel, shown as mean ± SEM, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  n ≥ 3) of Y79 cells between Ctrl group and PTEN-OE group. ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01;
  *P < 0.05, by two-tailed t-test.
