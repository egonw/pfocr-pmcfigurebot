caption: 'Metabolic analysis of huPMCs following TKT knockdown. A Schematic of metabolic
  pathways with intermediates labelled from 1, 2–13C glucose. Glucose enters the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle (blue block) after glycolysis (yellow block). Alternatively, glucose
  enters the PPP with the oxidative phase (pink block) and non-oxidative phase (grey
  block). GA3P and F6P in PPP non-oxidative phase can re-enter glycolysis in a TKT-dependent
  fashion. B Isotopologue analysis of pyruvate. Mn: molecules with n13C (n: number
  of 13C). C Abundance of pyruvate isotopologues. D Isotopologue analysis of M2 metabolites
  (citrate, aKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate) in TCA cycle. E Abundance of total
  citrate, aKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate. B, D: All comparisons were conducted
  using a t-test. n = 3 per group. Error bars = SEM. *: p < 0.05. 6 PG: 6-phosphogluconate.
  αKG: α-ketoglutarate. E4P: erythrose 4-phosphate. F6P: fructose 6-phosphate. GA3P:
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. GC-MS: Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate.
  PPP: pentose phosphate pathway. R5P: ribose 5-phosphate. Ru5P: ribulose 5-phosphate.
  S7P: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle. TKT: transketolase.
  Xu5P: xylulose 5-phosphate. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
