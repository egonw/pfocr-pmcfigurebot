caption: Molecular targets of flavonoids. Flavonoids target PI3K and the MAPK signaling
  pathway, inducing survival and proliferation of tumor cells. Additionally, flavonoids
  can also affect p53 and influence cell cycle progression by regulation of cyclin
  dependent kinases (CDKs) and by apoptosis.
