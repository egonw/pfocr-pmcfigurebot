caption: 'Effect of EGCG on oxidative stress in vivo in CHD mice. (a) The activity
  level of ROS in cardiac tissues of mice in each group was detected biochemically;
  (b) the activity level of SOD in cardiac tissues of mice in each group was detected
  biochemically. ∗p < 0.05 vs. Control group; #p < 0.05 vs. Model group. CHD, coronary
  heart disease; EGCG, epigallocatechin gallate; SOD, superoxide dismutase, ROS, reactive
  oxygen species.'
