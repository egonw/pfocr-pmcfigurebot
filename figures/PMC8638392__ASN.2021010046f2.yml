caption: Activation of the HIF pathway by DMOG decreases sodium transport via the
  downregulation of ENaC and the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cultured mouse CCD principal
  cells. mpkCCDcl4 cells were grown to confluence on filters and exposed or not to
  1 mM DMOG for 24 hours. (A) Representative short-circuit current recording in Ussing
  chambers under a zero-voltage clamp showing the effect of amiloride (100 μM, apical
  side), amphotericin B (50 μg/ml, apical side), and ouabain (1 mM, basolateral side)
  application on the short-circuit current in the presence of 10 mM (orange lines)
  or 130 mM (blue lines) apical NaCl. Amiloride-, amphotericin B-, and ouabain-sensitive
  currents were determined from the changes in short-circuit current after drug application
  in the presence of 10 mM (orange dots) or 130 mM (blue dots) apical NaCl (B–D).
  Results are means±SEM from four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was
  performed by Mann–Whitney U test; *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.
