  cGVHD development
caption: (A) The splenocytes from WT mice on B6 background were intravenously (i.v.)
  injected at 6×106/mouse into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. The recipient mice
  were injected with vehicle or ST1072 at 1mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) from day
  −1 to day 3. Four days after cell transfer, serum was collected and subjected to
  mass spectrometry HPLC-MS analysis for different ceramide species. Data shown is
  pooled from two independent experiments (n=10 per group). BALB/c mice were lethally
  irradiated and transplanted with 5×106/mouse T-cell depleted-bone marrow (TCD-BM)
  alone or plus splenocytes (0.5×106/mouse) either from WT or CerS6KO B6 mice. One
  group of WT recipient mice was injected i.p. with ST1072 at 2 mg/kg from day-1 to
  day 28. The recipients were monitored for body weight and clinical score (B) until
  60 days post-BMT. Data shown is from two combined experiments (N=10–15 per group).
  Recipient clinical scores and body weight loss were compared using a nonparametric
  Mann-Whitney U test. Asterisks indicate statistical significance *p< 0.05, ***p
  < 0.001.
