caption: 'Lipid pathway enrichment analysis of plasma samples showing (A) the lipid
  classes that were detected in plasma regardless of the groups and (B) the lipids
  changing in the MCI and AD samples, representing the most impacted pathways. The
  green bars show the number of lipids that were measured in our sample and belonged
  to these pathways. Abbreviations: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPL, glycerophospholipid.'
