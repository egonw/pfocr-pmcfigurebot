caption: Effects of TMVΔCPmutMP on the expression of resistance signaling genes in
  N. benthamiana(A) A schematic diagram depicts marker genes for the salicylic acid
  (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways involved in plant
  resistance against pathogens.(B–D) Expression of NPR1, COI1, and EIN2 in the plants
  inoculated with the MMA buffer (Mock), pTMVΔCP, pTMVΔCPmutMP, or pTMV at 4 dpi in
  the inoculated leaves.(E) A schematic diagram depicts several key regulators of
  the ET signaling pathway. Synthesis of ethylene from its precursor ACC is catalyzed
  by ACO1; ethylene inhibits the activity of its receptor ETR1 which is a negative
  regulator of EIN2, an ethylene signal transducer; EIN2 activates the transcription
  factor EIN3 which is a positive regulator of ethylene-responsive genes.(F–H) Expression
  of ACO1, EIN3, and ETR1 in the plants inoculated with the MMA buffer (Mock), pTMVΔCP,
  pTMVΔCPmutMP, or pTMV at 4 dpi in the inoculated leaves. The expression level in
  leaves inoculated with pTMVΔCP was set as 1.0. The resulting values were expressed
  as mean ± SE (n = 6). Individual data points are represented by black dots and their
  numerical values are listed in  and . Differences between mean values assessed by
  the two-tailed t-test are statistically significant for the p-values ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; p ≥ 0.05 are not statistically significant
  (ns).
