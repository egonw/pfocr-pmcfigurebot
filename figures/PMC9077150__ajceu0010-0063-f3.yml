caption: Schematic diagram of the androgen pathway and the drugs common to prostate
  cancer treatment and feminizing hormone therapy. GnRH agonists work by using negative
  feedback to prevent the anterior pituitary from releasing LH, thereby preventing
  the testes from producing testosterone. R inhibitors prevent the transformation
  of testosterone to DHT, thereby, reducing the ability for the AR to bind to its
  preferred ligand. AR blockers directly inhibit the AR, preventing the DHT-AR complex
  from forming and translocating to the nucleus to activate proliferative transcription
  factors.
