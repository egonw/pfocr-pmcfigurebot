figure_title: PARK2 promotes osteoclast differentiation through NF-κB signaling
caption: (A and B) pOCs transfected with control (Con) siRNA or PARK2 siRNA were starved
  with serum-free medium and then stimulated with RANKL (500 ng/ml) for the indicated
  time. Both phospho-forms and total forms of the NF-κB signaling components (A) and
  MAPKs (B) were determined by western blotting. (C) pOCs transfected with control
  siRNA or PARK2 siRNA were serum-starved and then stimulated with RANKL (500 ng/ml)
  for 15 min. Representative confocal images are presented. Scale bars = 20 μm. ***P
  < 0.001. (D) BMMs transfected with control or PARK2 plasmid were cultured with or
  without BAY 11-7085 (5 μM) for 2 days. Protein levels of phospho-forms and total
  forms of p65 were detected by western blotting.
