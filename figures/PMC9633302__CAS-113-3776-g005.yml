caption: Metformin (Met) inhibited the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathway
  by downregulating tripartite motif‐containing 37 (TRIM37). (A) Metformin (20 mM)
  inhibited the expression of TRIM37, confirmed by western blot analysis. (B) Metformin
  (20 mM) inhibited the NF‐κB signaling pathway, confirmed by western blot analysis.
  (C) Western blot was used to detect the expression of the NF‐κB signaling pathway
  and invasion‐related proteins on the basis of metformin and TRIM37 overexpression.
  IKB, inhibitor of NF‐κB; IKK, IKB kinase

  cells by suppressing tripartite motif‐containing 37‐induced tumor necrosis factor
