figure_title: lncPSCA‐induced degradation of DDX5 releases RNA Pol II from the DDX5‐Pol
  II complex in nucleus
caption: 'Western blot for RNA Pol II among proteins pulled down with anti‐DDX5 (up)
  and for DDX5 among proteins pulled down with an anti‐Pol II antibody (down).Global
  increase in RNA Pol II signals after silencing of DDX5 (lv‐shD) in HGC‐27 cells.
  Average RNA Pol II ChIP‐seq signal at all RNA Pol II peak regions. Upper subpanel:
  negative control, Lv‐NC; lower subpanel: silencing of DDX5, lv‐shD.Reads per million
  mapped reads (RPM) of RNA Pol II ChIP‐seq signals of genes in human genome.KEGG
  Pathway analyses of overlapped differential expressed genes (DEGs) in both lncPSCA‐overexpression
  cells and the DDX5‐konckdown cells identified multiple pathways involved in cancer
  biology, with the P53 and MAPK signaling pathways as two of the most markedly changed
  pathways.RNA Pol II ChIP‐seq and RNA‐seq signals of PMAIP1, CDKN1A, SESN2, and SESN3
  in HGC‐27 cells. Red bars represent the RNA Pol II ChIP‐seq signal. Orange or blue
  bars represent the RNA‐seq signals of HGC‐27 cells overexpressing lncPSCA (lncP)
  or with silenced DDX5 (shD), respectively.Validation of candidate downstream genes
  of the lncPSCA‐DDX5 axis identified through the integrated analyses. RT–qPCR was
  performed for PMAIP1, CDKN1A, and SESN2 genes upon overexpression of lncPSCA (lncP),
  silencing of DDX5 (shD) or lncPSCA knockout. Error bars indicate the SEM. Data show
  one representative example of three biological replicates.ChIP‐qPCR assays were
  performed for PMAIP1, CDKN1A, and SESN2 genes and demonstrated that significantly
  decreased RNA Poll II enrichment around TSS of PMAIP1, CDKN1A and SESN2 in various
  stable lncPSCA knockout GC cell lines. Left subpanel: RNA Pol II ChIP‐qPCR fragments
  a, b, and c on PMAIP1, CDKN1A, and SESN2 genes; middle and right subpanels: RNA
  Pol II ChIP‐qPCR results of PMAIP1, CDKN1A, and SESN2 genes in MGC80‐3 (middle)
  and HGC‐27 cells (right). Data show one representative example of three biological
  replicates.Correlations between lncPSCA levels and the mRNA levels of the P53 signaling
  PMAIP1, CDKN1A, and SESN2 genes in gastric cancer tissues discovery cohort (n = 96)
  and validation cohort (n = 30). RNA levels were determined by RT–qPCR relative to
  GAPDH. The r values and P values are from Pearson’s correlation analyses. Data information:
  The difference between two groups was calculated using Student’s t test. The significance
  of expression association between different genes was calculated using Spearman’s
  correlation. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Source data are available online
