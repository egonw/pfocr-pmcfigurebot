caption: The construction of CRISPRi on conidia and GlcNAc metabolic pathway genes
  in Aspergillus niger SH2. (A) The GlcNAc metabolic pathway in Candida albicans.
  The red font denotes relevant genes. (B) Diagram of the CRISPRi working principle
  and the map of CRISPRi system in this study. In this study, the CRISPRi system consisted
  of dCas9-Mxi1 expression cassette and sgRNA expression cassette. The dCas9-Mxi1
  expression cassette was assembled into a pFC330 plasmid. However, the sgRNA expression
  cassette was inserted into the genome of Aspergillus niger SH2 (aamA gene locus).
  (C) The phenotype of the Aspergillus niger SH2 transformants on NCD plates, where
  1 WT means Aspergillus niger SH2 wild strain, 2 dCas9-Mxi1 only means the transformant
  for which only the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector was transferred into Aspergillus niger
  SH2, 3 dCas9 only1 means the transformant No. 1 for which only the pFC330-dCas9
  vector without Mxi1 was transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2, 4 dCas9 only2 means
  the transformant No. 2 for which only the pFC330-dCas9 vector without Mxi1 was transferred
  into Aspergillus niger SH2, 5 dCas9 + sgRNA without spacer RNA means the transformant
  for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized sgRNA general vector, without
  spacer RNA, were simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2, 6 hfbD-CRISPRi
  means the transformant for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized hfbD
  sgRNA general vector were simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2,
  7 GC-CRISPRi means the transformant for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized
  GC sgRNA general vector were simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2,
  8 Hxk1-CRISPRi means the transformant for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and
  linearized Hxk1 sgRNA general vector were simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus
  niger SH2, 9 H-MAPK1-CRISPRi means the transformant for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1
  vector and linearized H-MAPK1 sgRNA general vector were simultaneously transferred
  into Aspergillus niger SH2, 10 Ngt1-CRISPRi means the transformant for which the
  pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized Ngt1 sgRNA general vector were simultaneously
  transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2, 11 Dac1-CRISPRi means the transformant for
  which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized Dac1 sgRNA general vector were
  simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2, and 12 Uap1-CRISPRi means
  the transformant for which the pFC330-dCas9-Mxi1 vector and linearized Uap1 sgRNA
  general vector were simultaneously transferred into Aspergillus niger SH2. (D) qPCR
  analysis of the Aspergillus niger SH2 transformants. Samples 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
  and 12 are described as per (C). (E) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of the Aspergillus
  niger SH2 transformants. Samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are described
  as per (C). (F) The phenotype and micromorphology of the Aspergillus niger SH2 transformants
  on NCD plates. The * means p < 0.05.
