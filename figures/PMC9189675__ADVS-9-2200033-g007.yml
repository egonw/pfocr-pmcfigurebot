caption: Overview changes of the NK and T cells, and the activated phenotypes of NK
  cells induced by MWA of breast cancer (n = 6). A) UMAP analysis of peripheral NK
  and T cells showing 8 clusters before and after MWA. B) The proportions of each
  cell cluster before and after ablation. C) Heatmap of the gene sets of cytotoxicity,
  exhaustion/inhibitory, regulatory, naïve and co‐stimulation of these 8 cell clusters.
  D) GO enrichment pathway analysis of genes preferentially upregulated in XCL2+NK
  cells. E) Volcano plot showing upregulated genes of peripheral GZMB+NK cells induced
  by MWA. F) The cytotoxic scores of different peripheral NK cell clusters before
  and after MWA.
