caption: 'm6A-related exosome gene modification patterns in the role of anti-PD-1/L1
  immunotherapy. (a) Survival analyses for low (188 cases) and high (70 cases) MREGS
  patient groups in the anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy cohort using Kaplan-Meier curves
  (IMvigor210 cohort; P = 0.031, log-rank test). (b) The proportion of patients with
  response to PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy in low or high MREGS groups. SD: stable
  disease; PD: progressive disease; CR: complete response; PR: partial response; CR/PR:
  responder; SD/PD: nonresponder. Responder/nonresponder: 32%/68% in the low MREGS
  groups and 14%/86% in the high MREGS groups. (c) Distribution of MREGS in distinct
  anti-PD-L1 clinical response groups. (d) Survival analyses for low and high MREGS
  patient groups in the anti-PD1 immunotherapy cohort using Kaplan-Meier curves (GSE78220
  cohort; P = 0.223, log-rank test). (e) The proportion of patients with response
  to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in low or high MREGS groups. Responder/nonresponder:
  53%/47% in the low MREGS groups and 57%/43% in the high MREGS groups. (f) The correlation
  of MREGS with clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. CR, red; PD, blue; PR,
  yellow; SD, green. (g) Differences in stroma-activated pathways and TGFβ pathway
  in fibroblasts between low MREGS and high MREGS groups in the anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy
  cohort (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001). (h) Survival analyses for patients
  receiving anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy stratified by both MREGS and tumor neoantigen
  burden using Kaplan-Meier curves. H: high; L: low; NEO: tumor neoantigen burden
  (P < 0.05, log-rank test). (i) The predictive value of the quantification of m6A-related
  exosome gene modification patterns in patients treated with anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy
  (AUC, 0.725).'
