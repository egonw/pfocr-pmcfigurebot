caption: Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate activates AMPK. HUVECs were incubated with
  500 μM cholesterol crystals (CC) for 16 h. 10, 20, 40 μM Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate
  (STS) was added 1 h before CC treatment. (A) p-AMPK level in sections of the aortic
  arches was detected by immunofluorescence. (B) p-AMPKThr172, AMPK protein levels
  were determined by Western blot. Data are represented as mean ± SD of three independent
  replicates; **P < 0.01 vs VEH group; §§P < 0.01 vs cholesterol crystals group; ††P
  < 0.01 vs STS treatment group.
