caption: RRM2 knockdown reduces osteogenic development in MEFs. (A) RT-qPCR analysis
  indicated RRM2 expression in MEFs after transfection with siRRM2. (B) WB and (C)
  semi-quantification of WB revealed the protein expression levels of RRM2 in MEFs
  after transfection with siRRM2. RT-qPCR analysis indicated the expression levels
  of early osteogenic makers (D) COL1A1, (E) DLX5, (F) OSX and (G) RUNX2 in MEFs after
  RRM2 was knocked down using siRRM2. (H) ALP staining and (I) quantification of ALP
  staining of MEFs transfected with siRRM2 after culture for 7 days. RT-qPCR analysis
  revealed the expression levels of late osteogenic makers (J) OPN and (K) OCN) of
  MEFs after RRM2 was knocked down using siRRM2. (L) AR staining of MEFs treated with
  siRRM2 after culture for 21 days. **P<0.01 vs. control group. RRM2, ribonucleotide
  reductase M2; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; siRRM2, small interfering RNA-RRM2; WB, western blotting; COL1A1, collagen
  type I α1 chain; DLX5, distal-less homeobox 5; OSX, osterix; RUNX2, RUNX family
  transcription factor 2; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; OPN, osteopontin; OCN, osteocalcin;
  AR, Alizarin Red S.
