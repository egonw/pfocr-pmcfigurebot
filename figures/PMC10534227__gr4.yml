caption: 'Proteomics reveal metabolic pathway alterations and reduced small GTPases
  in Ggps1-deficient oocytes.A, distribution of significantly changed proteins at
  various magnitudes of difference in expression levels between Ggps1fl/fl and Ggps1-ZcKO
  ovulated oocytes detected by LC–MS/MS. The number of changed proteins in each category
  of fold change is indicated above each bar (3 weeks, n = 60–80, 2000 oocytes per
  group, fold change ≥ 1.2). B, heatmaps illustrating the enriched terms (KEGG terms
  and MF) identified by LC-MS/MS in ovulated Ggps1fl/fl and Ggps1-ZcKO oocytes. The
  proteins being analyzed are those with significant changes (∗p < 0.05, fold change
  ≥ 1.2). C, Venn diagram illustrating the relationships of the changed proteins identified
  by LC-MS/MS in Ggps1fl/fl and Ggps1-ZcKO GV and ovulated oocytes. DPs: differential
  proteins (∗p < 0.05, fold change ≥ 1.2). D, heatmaps illustrating the enriched terms
  of proteins that were independent in the Ggps1-ZcKO–ovulated oocytes. Heatmap of
  enriched terms was created by metascape (http://metascape.org/). E, heatmaps illustrating
  differences between Ggps1fl/fl and Ggps1-ZcKO ovulated oocytes in the expression
  of proteins that were involved in GTPase activity. To perform LC/MS analysis, ovulated
  oocytes from Ggps1fl/fl and Ggps1-ZcKO were divided into three replicates. F, identification
  of changes in small GTPases in ovulated oocytes by Western blot (n = 5–7, 150 oocytes
  per group). Tubulin served as an internal control. See also  and . Ggps1, geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase 1; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.'
