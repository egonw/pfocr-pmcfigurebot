caption: Metabolic network diagram of differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in
  the “fls2_Drought versus WT_Drought” comparison group. (a) Metabolic network diagrams
  of DAMs in the “fls2_Drought versus WT_Drought” comparison group. Solid lines indicate
  one‐step reactions; dashed lines indicate two‐or more‐step reactions. (b) The impact
  of DAMs in the “fls2_Drought versus WT_Drought” comparison on different metabolic
  pathways. All matching pathways for metabolites were determined based on p‐values
  obtained from a pathway enrichment analysis and pathway impact values derived from
  a pathway topology analysis.
