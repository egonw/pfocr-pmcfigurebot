caption: Hippo signaling pathway with prediction of overlaid molecular activity in
  A, responders, and B, nonresponders after bariatric surgery. A, Diagram of the canonical
  Hippo signaling pathway showing 6 genes upregulated (red) and 12 genes that did
  not reach statistical significance (gray) 12 months after bariatric surgery (T2)
  in responders (R), and B, 13 genes upregulated (red) and 5 genes that did not reach
  statistical significance (gray) in nonresponders (NR), along with predictions of
  biological functions. Cell proliferation (colored orange) is predicted to increase
  both in R and NR. The inset square shows that the STK4 gene is upregulated in T1
  (3) and T2 (4) in NR but not in R (1 and 2). Pathway and molecular activity prediction
  analyses were generated using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).
