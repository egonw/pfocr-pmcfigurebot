caption: Expression patterns of genes specific to wild barley H. spontaneum in pathways
  “plant hormone signal transduction” (ko04075) and “MAPK signaling pathway-plant”
  (ko04016) at the 0, 2, 12 and 24 h timepoints of salt stress (500 mM NaCl). All
  genes showed upregulation at the 2 and 12 h timepoints of salt stress (500 mM NaCl).
  Gene 1 = encodes two-component response regulator ORR3, gene 2 = encodes serine/threonine-protein
  kinase BSK1-2, gene 3 = encodes auxin-responsive protein SAUR71, gene 4 = encodes
  auxin-responsive protein SAUR36 (isoform 1), gene 5 = encodes auxin-responsive protein
  SAUR36 (isoform 2), gene 6 = encodes auxin-responsive protein SAUR40, gene 7 = encodes
  protein phosphatase 2C. Genes 1-6 regulate enzymes/proteins of the “plant hormone
  signal transduction” pathway, while genes 2 and 7 regulate enzymes of “MAPK signaling
  pathway-plant”. These seven genes were recently proven to be regulated in wild barley
  (H. spontaneum), yet are not regulated in cultivated barley []. See  for more details.
