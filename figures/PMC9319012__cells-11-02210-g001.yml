caption: 'RELA regulates UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. (A) Schematic view of the HBP pathway
  from Fructose-6 phosphate (Fruc-6P) to the formation of UDP-GlcNAc. Metabolites
  are colored in blue; enyzmes are green. UDP-GlcNAc is a donor for the N-glycosylation
  of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as well as protein GlcNAc-ylation. Abbreviations
  are: GFPT, Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase;
  UAP, UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine Pyrophosphorylase; and GNPNAT, Glucosamine-Phosphate
  N-Acetyltransferase. (B) Western blot of RELA in doxycycline-regulated hSAECs. Cells
  were cultured in the absence (-) or presence (+) of DOX before whole cell lysis.
  Top panel, anti-RELA staining (green); bottom panel, β-actin staining (green) as
  housekeeping control. The prominent 65kDa RELA staining is depleted after DOX treatment.
  MWM, molecular-weight markers (red). (C) qRT-PCR. Cells cultured in the absence
  or presence of DOX were mock-infected or RSV-infected for 24 h prior to qRT-PCR.
  Data are expressed as a fold change of the untreated control, normalized to PP1A.
  Each symbol is a biological replicate (n = 3). Top panel, RELA mRNA; bottom panel,
  IL6 mRNA. Data are significant by ANOVA. **, p < 0.01 by post-hoc Tukey comparison.
  (D) Cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc abundance. Cells were treated as in panel (C), and total
  cellular UDP-GlcNAc was measured by LC-MS/MS. *, p < 0.01. (E) qRT-PCR of RELA depleted
  hSAECs by siRNA. hSAECs were transfected with scrambled (Scr) or RELA-targeting
  siRNA. Top panel, fold change of RELA mRNA; bottom panel, IL6 mRNA. (F) UDPG-GlcNAc
  in siRNA- transfected cells. Intracellular UDP-GlcNAc was measured in control siRNA
  or RELA-siRNA transfected cells in the absence or presence of RSV infection. *,
  p < 0.01; ns, not significant.'
