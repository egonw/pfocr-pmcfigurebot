caption: “Target-Pathway” Network of triptolide against MN. (A) The nodes in the network
  display targets and the signaling pathways in triptolide and MN are represented
  by the triangle nodes. (B) The targets of triptolide enrichment in the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. The dark Orange targets enriched by top 10 targets that were
  screened according to their MCC score and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway together.
