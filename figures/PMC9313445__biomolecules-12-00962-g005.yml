caption: '(A) Metabolic pathway analysis of clinically confirmed diabetic status;
  (B) metabolic pathway analysis based on latest HbA1c values. Each bubble in the
  bubble diagram represents a metabolic pathway. Color gradient and circle size indicate
  the significance of the pathway ranked by p-value (yellow: higher p-values and red:
  lower p-values) and pathway impact score (the larger the circle, the higher the
  pathway impact score). The top three metabolic pathways were identified by name
  according to the -log(p) value and pathway impact score.'
