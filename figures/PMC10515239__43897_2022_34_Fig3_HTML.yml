caption: 'Evolution and expressions of genes in relation to ascorbic acid biosynthesis
  and disease resistance. a Evolutionary expansions of genes involved in the D-galacturonate
  pathway of ascorbic acid biosynthesis. Expressions of these genes in five different
  tissues (from left to right: fruit, flower, leaf, stem and root) were revealed.
  b Differential expressions of the common R genes between Ae and Ac. A previously
  available RNA-seq data was used and two sampling repeats in each of the three stages
  of Psa infection are shown'
