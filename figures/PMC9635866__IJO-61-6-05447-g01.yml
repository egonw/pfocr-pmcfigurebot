caption: Transcriptome analysis of realgar-treated H23 cells. (a) H23 cells without
  realgar treatment; (b) H23 cells with realgar treatment (2 Âµg/ml). (A) Determination
  of DEGs by volcano plots. (B) Heatmap analysis and the relative contents (red and
  green areas represent high and low expression, respectively). (C) GO enrichment
  analysis of DEGs. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the upregulated and downregulated
  genes. (E) PPI network analysis of the upregulated and downregulated genes. (F and
  G) Venn and PPI diagrams of realgar-related gene and ferroptosis-related gene intersection.
  DEGs, differentially expressed genes, GO, gene ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; PPI, protein-protein interaction.
