caption: Validation of the SIIS model in the TCGA-COAD and SYSUCC cohorts. (A) Bar
  chart (left) showing the correlations between SIIS value and infiltration levels
  of TME cells and scatter plot (right) showing the correlation between SIIS value
  and cell clusters infiltration levels in the TCGA-COAD cohort. Nonsignificant correlations
  are marked by gery. (B) Correlation matrix of SIIS values and the activation levels
  of biological process in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (C) Scatter plot represents the comparison
  of the protein expression level of the pathway marker genes between patients in
  the high-SIIS and low-SIIS groupd. (D) Forest plot showing the associations between
  SIIS and other published signatures in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (E) Box plot of the
  comparison of SIIS values between the different CMS subtypes. (F) Forest plot showing
  the associations between SIIS and overall survival in various subgroups. (G) Forest
  plot showing the benefit of ADJC in different subtypes. (H) Box plot of the comparison
  of the SIIS score between the fluorouracil response and nonresponse groups. (I)
  Box plot of estimated IC50 values of chemotherapy drugs in high-SIIS and low-SIIS
  subgroup in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (J) Bar chart (upper) showing the correlations
  between SIIS value and infiltration levels of TME cells and scatter plot (down)
  showing the correlations between SIIS value and infiltration levels of cell clusters
  in the SYSUCC cohort. Nonsignificant correlations are marked by gery. (K) Correlation
  matrix of SIIS values and the activation levels of biological process in the SYSUCC
  cohort. The value of correlation coefficients was represented by both the shading
  of the color and sector size. (L-M) Box plot of SIIS values in the fluorouracil
  response and nonresponse groups (L) and in the CMS subgroups (M). SIIS, stromal
  cell infiltration intensity; Cor, correlation; Tcm, T central memory; Tem, T effector
  memory; Th, T helper; DC, dendritic cell; aDC, activated dendritic cell; iDC, immature
  dendritic cell; Tgd, T gamma delta; NK, natural killer; TFH, T follicular helper;
  AUC, area under curve; CI, confidence interval; ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy; R response;
  NR, nonresponse; CMS, consensus molecular subtypes; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymalÂ transition;
  OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; UPR, unfolded protein response; FA, fatty acid.
