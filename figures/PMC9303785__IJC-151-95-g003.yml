caption: Enriched REACTOME pathways and transcription factor targets for the 5′ fusion
  partners of miRNA hosts, split by molecular subtype for the TCGA‐BRCA cohort. Colour
  intensity shows the fraction of genes in each REACTOME pathway that is regulated
  by a given transcription factor, as predicted by UniBind [Color figure can be viewed
