caption: 'SKF alleviated airway epithelial barrier dysfunction and dampened inflammatory
  responses in lung tissues of ALI mice. (A) SKF upregulated the expression of tight
  junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin along airway epithelium upon LPS stimulation.
  Scale bar: 40 μm. (B) Immunohistochemical images showing effects of SKF on DRD5
  expression in pulmonary macrophages (red arrows) and AECs. Scale bar: 40 μm. (C,
  D) Immunoblotting assay and related quantitative analysis validating the regulatory
  activity of SKF on p-p65/NLRP3/Caspase-1 expression for pro-inflammatory pathway
  activation, ZO-1, Occludin expression for epithelial barrier integrity, and NQO1
  expression for endogenous antioxidative system. n = 4. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001,
  ns: not significant. Error bars represented mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was
  performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni''s post hoc test. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
