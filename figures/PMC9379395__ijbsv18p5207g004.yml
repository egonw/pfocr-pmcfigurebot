caption: Predicting EGR1 as upstream transcription factor of circNDRG1. (A and B)
  Venn diagram representations of mRNA-seq in 4 bladder cancer cells and the intersection
  of predicted transcription factor from the JASPAR database. (C) The sequences binding
  with EGR1. (D and E) RT-qPCR and western-blotting assay to measure EGR1 mRNA and
  protein level after nitroxoline treatment. (F and G) EGR1 mRNA and protein measured
  by RT-qPCR and western-blotting assay after knocking down EGR1 by siRNA. (H and
  I) RT-qPCR showed the down-regulation of EGR1 contributed to the reduce of circNDRG1
  and mRNA NDRG1. (J and K) EGR1-OE increased the mRNA and protein of EGR1 by RT-qPCR
  and western-blotting. (L and M) RT-qPCR showed overexpression of EGR1 activated
  circNDRG1 and mRNA NDRG1 expression. (N) ChIP assay of the binding of EGR1 to the
  promoter of host gene NDRG1. (O and P) Transwell and wound-healing assay showed
  that EGR1 inhibited the capacity of migration in bladder cancer. *P<0.05, **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001.
