caption: The actin–MKL1 pathway regulates expression of ITGα5 in DFAT cells. (A) Relative
  abundance of Mkl1 and Itga5 mRNAs (left) and immunoblot analysis of ITGα5 (right)
  in DFAT cells transfected with Mkl1 (siMkl1-#1 or -2#) or control (siCont) siRNAs
  for 48 h. (B) Domain organization of wild-type (WT) and mutant (N100) forms of MKL1.
  (C) Relative abundance of Itga5 mRNA in DFAT-TetOn-FLAG-MKL1-WT or DFAT-TetOn-FLAG-MKL1-N100
  cells exposed for 24 h to LatA (0.4 μM) or doxycycline (DOX, 1 μg/ml) as indicated
  (Upper). The cells were also subjected to immunoblot analysis of FLAG and ITGα5
  (Lower). All quantitative data are means ± s.d. from three independent experiments.
  ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant (Student’s t test). (D) Model for regulation of
  ITGα5 expression by the actin-MKL1 pathway. The CArG box is the consensus binding
  sequence for the SRF-MKL1 complex.
