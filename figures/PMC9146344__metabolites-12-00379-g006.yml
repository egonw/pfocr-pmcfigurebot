caption: 'Metabolome view of metabolic pathways (MetPA) mapped from identified metabolites.
  Metabolite KEGG IDs from both LPS chemotype-treated WT, lbr2-2 or bak1-4 were mapped
  to pathways as displayed. (Aâ€“C) represents the metabolome view for the WT, lbr2-2
  and bak1-4, respectively. The graphs were arranged such that the p-values from the
  pathway analysis are on the y-axis and the impact values from the pathway topology
  analysis on the x-axis. The colour gradient of the circles (pathways) from light
  yellow to dark red indicates lower to higher significance, respectively. Pathways
  are numbered #1: Alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, #2: Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,
  #3: Flavone and flavanol biosynthesis and #4: Glucosinolate biosynthesis. Notably,
  pathways #3 and #4 were not mapped in the lbr2-2 and bak1-4 mutants.'
