figure_title: Interrogation of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in mPTCL
caption: AGSEA of HALLMARK gene signature was performed on whole mPTCL‐infiltrated
  versus wildtype spleens and purified TCRvβ8+ mPTCL versus wildtype CD4+ T‐cells
  (n = 6). Eighteen of the top 20 positive enriched signatures that were identified
  in whole spleen and purified cells are shown. Red circles depict significant enrichment
  (FDR q‐value < 0.05). NES—normalized enrichment score. FDR Q‐values can be found
  in Dataset .BWestern blot for phosphorylated and total ZAP70, AKT, S6, and GSK3β
  in lysates from three control (C) C57bl/6J and three mPTCL (T) spleens. Murine DLBCL
  cell line A20 is a positive control for constitutively active AKT signaling.C, D(C)
  Kaplan–Meyer curve showing time to welfare endpoint (survival) in mice implanted
  IV with 104 mPTCL cells and dosed with PI3Kδ inhibitor PI‐3065 at 75 mg/kg PO QD
  (n = 10) (log‐rank test P > 0.9999) or (D), the pan‐AKT inhibitor capivasertib (AZD5363)
  dosed at 130 mg/kg PO BID 4 days on/3 days off (4/3; n = 9) versus vehicle control
  (n = 10) (log‐rank test P = 0.0498 in favor of the control arm). Results in C and
  D are representative of three independent studies of PI3K pathway inhibitors.EGSEA
  of REACTOME terms in the comparison of transcriptome from whole spleens and purified
  cells as in (A). A selection of 18 of the top 35 pathways are shown (all with FDR
  P‐value < 0.05). FDR Q‐values can be found in Dataset .FHeatmap of log2 normalized
  expression of significantly upregulated genes (P‐adjusted < 0.05) in “REACTOME Activation

  for DNA damage marker γH2AX in wildtype and mPTCL spleens. mPTCL data are representative
  of six mice. Arrowhead indicates positive nuclear foci.HWestern blot for γH2AX,
  total H2AX, CHK1, and RPA32 in control C57bl/6J and mPTCL spleens. GAPDH is a loading
  control. Three representative samples per group are shown in the blot (left), and
  quantification was performed on n = 6 at right. T‐test P = 0.0798 (CHK1; not statistically
  significant, ns), P = 8.69E‐05 (RPA32), P = 2.11E‐03 (γH2AX). ***P < 0.001.
