caption: Potential mechanisms of Urolithin A and its analogue mediated chemosensitization
  of 5FUR colon cancers. 5FUR cells escape 5FU treatment and exhibit increased expression
  of drug transporters, EMT makers with more invasive properties. Increased expression
  of drug transporters results in increased drug efflux. UroA/UAS03 in combination
  with 5FU treatment leads to decrease in drug transporters and results decreased
  drug efflux and increased intracellular drug concentration. Co-treatments reduce
  EMT markers. UroA/UAS03 mediate chemosensitization through FOXM1-FOXO3 dependent
  pathway, where co-treatment leads to increase in FOXO3 and decrease FOXM1 expression.
