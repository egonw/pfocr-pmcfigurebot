caption: 'Alternative transcriptional genetic subtypes in H69A and H69S cells. (A)
  H69A and H69S cells were treated with RAD001 (1 or 8 µg/ml), cisplatin (1 µg/ml)
  + etoposide (2 µg/ml), or in combination for 48 h. The cells were then harvested
  and subjected to western blotting analysis using the indicated antibodies. (B-D)
  Quantitative analysis of (A): mock-treated H69A cells were used as the control.
  Data are presented as the mean ± the SD of three independent experiments. (E) For
  48 h, H69A and H69S cells were treated with cisplatin (1 µg/ml) + etoposide (2 µg/ml),
  anlotinib (0.5 or 2 µg/ml), CS2164 (0.5 or 2 µg/ml), cisplatin (1 µg/ml) + etoposide
  (2 µg/ml) + anlotinib (0.5 or 2 µg/ml) and cisplatin (1 µg/ml) + etoposide (2 µg/ml)
  + CS2164 (0.5 or 2 µg/ml). Western blotting analysis was used to detect the expression
  of ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 and YAP1. GAPDH was used as the internal standard. (F-H)
  Quantitative analysis of (E): mock-treated H69A cells were used as the control (100%).
  Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
