caption: PLCε knockdown suppresses AR expression and nuclear translocation via different
  signaling pathways. (A) Immunofluorescence demonstrated AR intracellular distribution
  at 48 h following infection with LV-shPLCε and ad-Gli1/ad-Gli2 in EN-R cells. Magnification,
  ×400. PLCε knockdown inhibited AR nuclear translocation in EN-R cells. However,
  the overexpression of Gli-2 reversed the inhibitory effect produced by PLCε. (B)
  The relative mRNA expression level of Gli-1 and Gli-2 following treatment with an
  overexpression plasmid of ad-Gli1, ad-Gli2 was examined by RT-qPCR and β-actin served
  as loading control (NC stands for empty vector plasmid group (*P<0.05, **P<0.01).
  (C) Protein expression level of Gli-1 and Gli-2 following treatment with the overexpression
  plasmid of ad-Gli1, ad-Gli2 and PLCε knockdown. (D) The mRNA expression level of
  Gli-1 and Gli-2 following treatment with overexpression plasmid of ad-Gli1, ad-Gli2
  and PLCε knockdown (*P<0.05, **P<0.01). (E) Western blotting showed that PLCε knockdown
  significantly decreased the AR expression in the nucleus. However, the expression
  of AR in the nucleus increased following Gli-2 overexpression. (F-H) Western blotting
  indicated that PLCε knockdown inhibited the PSA expression via the p-STAT3 signaling
  pathway (The results are represented as the mean ± SD; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001).
  (I and J) Western blotting showed that the downregulation of PLCε decreased the
  p-STAT3 protein expression in EN-R cells (The results are represented as the mean
  ± SD; **P<0.01). PLCε, phospholipase Cε; AR, androgen receptor; Gli, glioma-associated
  homolog; EN-R, enzalutamide-resistant cell line.

  prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by suppressing the androgen receptor signaling
  pathway.
