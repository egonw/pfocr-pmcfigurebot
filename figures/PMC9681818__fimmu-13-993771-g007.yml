caption: Efferocytosis in macrophages upregulates inflammasome gene expression. (A)
  Experimental workflow and heatmap for induction of efferocytosis in mouse bone marrow
  derived macrophages and subsequent RNA-seq (n=5). BMDM were incubated with PKH26
  labeled AC for 1hr. Non-engulfed AC were washed with 1X PBS and after an additional
  6hr, PKH26+ BMDM were sorted and processed for RNA seq. Heatmap showing differential
  gene expression profiles between macrophages pre and post induction of efferocytosis
  as measured by bulk RNA-seq. (B) IPA and GO analyses show increased expression of
  IL-1 signaling pathways post efferocytosis. (C) Graphical representation of selected
  inflammasome genes indicate enrichment of NLRP3/IL-1 pathway post efferocytosis.
  ns, not significant.
