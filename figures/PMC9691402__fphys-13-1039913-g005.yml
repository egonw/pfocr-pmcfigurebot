caption: 'ERα-NRF1-OMI regulates macroautophagy and mitophagy flux. (A–C) Western
  blot analysis of Atg7, Atg3, beclin1, LC3 I and LC3 II (A), the co-staining of TOMM20,
  lysosome and DAPI (B) and the co-staining of TOMM20, LC3 II and DAPI (C) in A7r5
  cells treated with FBS, transfected with adenoviruses expressing ERα or noncoding
  control. (D-H) Western blot analysis of Atg7, Atg3, beclin1, LC3 I and LC3 II (D),
  the co-staining of TOMM20, lysosome and DAPI (E), the co-staining of TOMM20, LC3
  II and DAPI (F), the expression level of caspase9, caspase3 and cleaved caspase3
  (G) and cytosolic cyt-c and mitochondrial cyt-c (H) in A7r5 cells treated with FBS,
  transfected with adenoviruses expressing OMI or noncoding control. 3MA and FCCP
  were used as mitophagy inhibitor and activator respectively. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
  and ***p < 0.001 vs. control, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. FBS, Δp < 0.05 and
  ΔΔΔp < 0.001 vs. FBS + Ad-OMI.'
