caption: Effect of L-anserine, L-carnosine, and ACCE on melanin production in MNT-1
  cells. (A) Melanin content in MNT-1 cells was measured at 72 h after treatment with
  2 and 10 µg/mL of Arbutin, 1 and 5 µg/mL of L-anserine or L-carnosine, and 1.0 ×
  104 and 2.0 × 104 μg/mL of ACCE. (B) Cell viability of MNT-1 cells was measured
  at 72 h after treatment with ACCE using MTT assay. Star (*) represents p < 0.05
  by Student’s t-test.
