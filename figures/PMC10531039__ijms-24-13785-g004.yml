caption: 'Inhibiting Rho/MRTF pathway diminished actin stress fibers and reversed
  the Vem–insensitivity of resistant YUMM lines. (a,b): YUMM cells were treated with
  3 or 10 µM CCG-257081 or DMSO control for 24 h, then fixed and stained with Rhodamine
  Phalloidin and DAPI. (c,d): Actin stress fibers were quantified as described in
  . Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-tests. * p < 0.05; ** p <
  0.01; ns, not significant. Representative images are from three independent biological
  replicates; the scale bar is 100 μm. (e,f): The Vem sensitivity of Parental and
  Vem–resistant cells was tested with and without CCG-257081. Cells were treated with
  Vem and CCG-257081 at the indicated concentrations for 72 h, then viability was
  measured with CellTiter-Glo. Viability data were normalized to untreated cells (in
  the presence of DMSO). Data were fit to 3-parameter inhibition curves (i.e., Hill
  slope = 1) in GraphPad Prism v.10 software with the bottom parameter constrained
  to be greater than zero and fitted parameters are shown in . (g): IC50 values were
  difficult to determine accurately, so an AUC analysis was done examine Vem–sensitivity.
  With DMSO vehicle, the two resistant lines (arrows) showed an AUC value for the
  Vem concentration response curve at least 0.5 units greater than that of the parental,
  Vem–sensitive, cells. CCG-257081 at 7.5 and 15 mM eliminated the AUC difference
  between P and R cell lines. Data are averages from three independent experiments.'
