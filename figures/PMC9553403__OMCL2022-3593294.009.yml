caption: 'MSCs-Exo alleviated hippocampus ferroptosis of dNCR mice in a SIRT1-dependent
  manner. The mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: Sham group, dNCR group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo
  group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo + EX-527 group, and dNCR+EX-527 group. (a) TEM was employed
  to detect the ultrastructure of hippocampus in aged mice (bar = 1.0 μm). (b, c)
  ROS (red fluorescent signal) were detected using DHE staining (bar = 100 μm). (d)
  The GSH level by GSH Colorimetric Assay Kit. (e) The MDA level by MDA Colorimetric
  Assay Kit. (f) The Fe2+ level by Ferrous Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit. (g–j) GPX4,
  P53, and SLC7A11 expressions in each group were determined by Western blot. (k–m)
  Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions in each group were determined by Western blot. gprot:
  gram protein; mgprot: milligram protein. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group).
