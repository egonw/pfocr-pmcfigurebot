figure_title: Identification of NAAG as a crucial tumor-promoting metabolite in BLIS
  tumors
caption: 'a Screening criteria of metabolites potentially promoting tumor progression
  in BLIS tumors. b RFS of patients with different NAAG abundances of BLIS tumors.
  The P value was calculated by the log rank test. c Confirmation of NAAG by comparison
  with standard compound. Measured MS/MS spectral fragmentation profiles (top, in
  red) matched those of chemical standards (bottom, in gray). d Illustration of the
  NAAG metabolism pathway. e, f mRNA expression of RIMKLA and RIMKLB (e) and their
  relationship with NAAG abundance in BLIS tumors (f). g Quantification of cell proliferation
  after knocking down RIMKLB with shRNA and the complement of NAAG. h Right panel:
  quantification of cells migrating across transwell filters and invading through
  matrigel-coated transwells after knocking down RIMKLB with shRNA and the complement
  of NAAG. Left panel: representative images of three replicates. Ten random fields
  were counted per insert at 20×. i Experimental design. j, k Effect of RIMKLB knockdown
  and NAAG complement on tumor growth (j) and tumor weight (k) (n = 6 for each group).
  Statistical comparisons in g–k were conducted using two-tailed Student’s t-test.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM. Scale bars, 200 μm. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01;
  *P < 0.05; ns, P ≥ 0.05. NAA, N-acetyl-aspartic acid.'
