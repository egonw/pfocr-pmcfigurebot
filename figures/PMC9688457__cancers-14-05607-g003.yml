caption: CI and CII possess different molecular characteristics. (a) Box plot showing
  CNV score in two clusters in 2012 TCGA CRC and 2019 CPTAC CRC databases. (b) Volcano
  plot showing expressions of DNA damage proteins in two clusters in three CRC proteomics
  databases (Blue and red indicate Log2 (fold change (CII/CI) > 0.5 and Log2 (fold
  change (CII/CI) < −0.5 respectively, p < 0.05). (c) Heatmap showing selected DNA
  damage protein engaged DNA repair pathways (p < 0.05) through four proteomic cohorts.
  (d) Box plot showing phosphorylation of Polymerase 2 (PORL2A) at S2/5 sites in two
  clusters in 2019 CPTAC CRC databases (left) and 2020 Cancer cell CRC databases (right)
  [,]. (e,f) Pathway enriched in two clusters in two CRC proteomics databases analyzed
  by GESA (Two−sided unpaired t test).
