caption: Effects of cerebral I/R on histopathological changes, and the expressions
  of LRP1, TXNIP, and NLRP3 inflammasome. (a) HE staining of hippocampal CA1 area
  (×400), scale bar = 20 μm; the arrows indicate injured neurons. (b) Quantitative
  analysis of normal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area. (c) Double immunofluorescence
  staining (IF) of LRP1 (red) with microglia (Iba-1, green), neurons (NeuN, green),
  and astrocytes (GFAP, green) in the hippocampal CA1 region at 72 h after cerebral
  I/R. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), scale bar = 20 μm. (d) Representative
  bands of Western blot data. (e–i) Quantitative analysis of the Western blot bands.
  Data were represented as mean ± SEM. Western blot, n = 6 per group; HE staining,
  n = 8 per group; double immunofluorescence staining, n = 3 per group. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sham group.
