caption: Gene ontology analysis as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  analysis of the host genes of circRNAs with differential expression. GO analysis
  annotates differentially expressed circRNAs through three aspects, including (a)
  biological process, (b) cellular components, and (c) molecular function. The bar
  plots show the top ten improvement score values of the expressive enrichment terms.
  (d) The top ten relevant pathways are identified for the differentially expressed
  circRNAs. The enrichment score value of displayed Pathway ID equals “−log10 (p value).”
  The dot plot discloses the top ten enrichment score (−log10 (p value)) values of
  the expressive enrichment pathway.
