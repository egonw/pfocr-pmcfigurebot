caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes. A Canonical
  pathways analysis using DEGs with adjusted P-value <0.05 (no fold-change cut-off).
  A positive z-score predicts activation of the indicated pathway (indicated in red),
  whereas a negative z-score predicts downregulation (indicated in blue). The adjusted
  P-value for each of the affected pathways is indicated on the x-axis as −log10 P-value,
  with the highest value being the most significant. B Upstream regulator analysis
  using DEGs with adjusted P-value <0.05 (no fold-change cut-off). A positive z-score
  predicts activation of the indicated regulator based on the expression patterns
  of downstream genes, whereas a negative z-score predicts inhibition. Remark: After
  Benjamini-Hochberg correction, only RICTOR and MYCN were found to have adjusted
  P-value <0.05. C RICTOR and MYCN networks. The analysis was performed in silico
  using IPA and Pathway Designer. The genes are represented as colored nodes. Specific
  upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) genes from the experimental dataset
  involved in determining the activation state of the upstream regulator are shown
  with direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines) relationships to the upstream
  regulators. Color intensity reflects magnitude of change. Genes without color were
  not affected by O. volvulus infection. The network diagram shows the biological
  relationship between the indicated genes lines: — represents direct physical interactions;
  ----- represents indirect functional interactions; → represents activation; ┤represents
  inhibition. The blue lines indicate that the direction of regulation is consistent
  with IPA prediction. In contrast, yellow lines indicate that the regulation observed
  is inconsistent with expectations, while grey lines indicate lack of pre-existing
  data to formulate expectations. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent
  the functional class of the genes. D Diseases and functions analysis using DEGs
  with adjusted P-value < 0.05 (no fold-change cut-off). A positive z-score indicates
  functions that are activated, whereas a negative z-score indicates functions that
  are inhibited. Remark: After Benjamini-Hochberg correction, only the top 7 functions
  were found to have adjusted P-value <0.05. E Network analysis using IPA and Pathway
  Designer showing the proteins associated with decreased Th17 immune response, decreased
  antibody response and decreased proliferation of activated T lymphocytes. Red-colored
  shapes denote upregulated genes and green colored shapes denote downregulated genes;
  the darker the color, the greater the change. The blue lines indicate that the direction
  of regulation is consistent with IPA prediction, while grey lines indicate lack
  of pre-existing data to formulate expectations.'
