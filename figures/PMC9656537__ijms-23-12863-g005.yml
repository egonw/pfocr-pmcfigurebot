caption: 'CK suppresses TLR4 signaling pathway in the presence of high glucose concentration.
  (A) The protein expression of TLR4, TLR2 and phosphorylated and total MAPK p38,
  JNK, and IκB-α were detected in mesangial cells. (B) The protein expression of phosphorylated
  and total NF-κB, and NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were detected in mesangial
  cells. (C) The protein expression of phosphorylated and total Stat3, Smad3, and
  Erk1/2; the protein expression of MyD88 and TGF-β1 were detected. Data were expressed
  as means ± SEM (n = 3). LG, low glucose medium; HG, high glucose medium. ###p <
  0.001, ##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05 compared to normal. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p
  < 0.05 compared to model.'
