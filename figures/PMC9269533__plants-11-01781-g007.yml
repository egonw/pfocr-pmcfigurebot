caption: Relative expression analyses of genes from ethylene signaling pathway in
  “Hass” avocado before application of 1–MCP. (A) Relative expression of PamETR1,
  (B) Relative expression of PamCTR1. (C) Relative expression of PamEIL1. (D) Relative
  expression of PamEIL3. The transcript accumulation of genes was determined by qPCR.
  Expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene PamTCPB and the expression is
  relative to that in LDM fruit (day 0). Bars represent the means of three replicates
  ± SE. Different lowercase and capital letters indicate a significant difference
  among treatments and harvest times by LSD analysis (p-value < 0.05).
