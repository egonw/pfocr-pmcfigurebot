caption: 'A summarized figure demonstrating the linkage between the gut microbiome
  and gastric cancer and esophageal cancer. Section 1 Gastric cancer: HtrA protease
  secreted by H.pylori produce CagA protein by cleaving occludin, claudin-8 and E-cadherin.
  The cagA protein promotes EMT by activating the YAP pathway and inducing tumorigenesis
  through activation of NF-κB, PTEN, and SHP2 pathways. The production of ROS induced
  by H.pylori via the NF-κB pathway and inflammation contributes to DNA damage. H.
  pylori infection induces gastric stem cells to proliferate and stimulate gland hyperplasia
  through R-spondin 3 and Axin2. The interaction of CagA and PAR1b induces genomic
  instability by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of BRCA1 and YAP. The hypermethylation
  of USF1 by H. pylori degrades the p53 proteasome to promote gene instability. H.pylori-induced
  inflammation upregulates NOX1/ROS signaling pathway to promote the stemness of gastric
  cancer. H. pylori promotes the proliferation of cancer cell infection by activating
  the RASAL2/β-catenin signaling pathway. Section 2 ESCC: P. gingivalis trigger activation
  of NF-κB to induce EMT through the Smad/YAP/TAZ signaling pathway.'
