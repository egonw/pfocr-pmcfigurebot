caption: 'CD155 triggers epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) cells. (A) Representative phalloidin staining images of CD155 knockdown
  and overexpression HCC cells. Scale bar: 10 μm. (B) mRNA and protein expression
  levels of EMT‐related markers in CD155 knockdown and overexpression HCC cells were
  detected by RT‐PCR and Western blot (WB) assays; t‐tests were used. (C) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining images of EMT‐related markers in CD155 knockdown and
  overexpression HCC cells. Scale bar: 50 μm. Error bars represent the SEM from at
  least three independent experiments. *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001'
article_title: CD155/SRC complex promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via
  inhibiting the p38 MAPK signalling pathway and correlates with poor prognosis.
