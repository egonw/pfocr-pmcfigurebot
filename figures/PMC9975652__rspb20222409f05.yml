caption: Linked assemblies of biosphere encoders and decoders. Multiple encoder–decoder
  pathways, including processes and structural entities, operate in parallel and are
  intertwined in a variety of ways forming chains and networks. Here for example,
  the immune system proteins are decoded from DNA by encoder–decoder A (shown in red
  above its constituent entities). Encoder–decoder B (blue) encodes the immune protein
  into an immune response pattern which is then decoded to generate health. Encoder–decoder
  B may be connected to additional entities and processes (not shown). Encoder–decoder
  C (shown in green below its constituent entities) can be seen as encoding a DNA
  sequence into a protein molecule code, which is then decoded into an immune response.
  More generally, every interaction, input, code or output of a given natural encoder–decoder
  pathway may also serve a function in another encoder–decoder pathway. The inputs
  to each encoding and decoding process may include additional entities beyond the
  ones shown here. Furthermore, each one of the many steps that constitute each encoder
  or decoder is an interaction in its own right, with its own description of input,
  encoder process, code, decoder process and output.
