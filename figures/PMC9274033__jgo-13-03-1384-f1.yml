caption: hCGβ expression in pancreatic cancer tissues and correlations with tumor
  progression. (A) Examples of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and hCGβ immunohistochemistry
  of primary lesion. The magnification is ×40. (B) Relationship between IRS and tumor
  T factor and N factor. IRS was calculated by multiplying the staining intensity
  by the staining range. *, P<0.05. Scale bars =50 µm. hCGβ, human chorionic gonadotropin
  free beta-subunit; IRS, immunoreactive score.
