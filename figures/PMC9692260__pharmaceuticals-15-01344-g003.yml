caption: 'The summary of the role of anthocyanin in attenuating mechanisms of diabetic
  CVD. Anthocyanin increases NO bioactivity and upregulation of Nrf2, which induces
  the production of endogenous antioxidants and limits oxidative stress. Anthocyanin
  also has been proposed to downregulate NF-κB and lead to reduced expression and
  production of cytokines involved (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and further
  reduces the inflammatory response. NF-κB downregulates TGF-β expression as well
  as anthocyanin treatment, and causes reduced ECM accumulation and limits fibrosis.
  Anthocyanin also reduces caspase-3 and caspase-9 levels, which further attenuates
  apoptosis. Abbreviations: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; IL, interleukin; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; VCAM, vascular
  cell adhesion protein 1; ECM, extracellular matrix. (-) sign indicates the inhibition/downregulation
  of related gene/protein. Black arrow indicates the activity of anthocyanin while
  red arrow indicates the subsequent event/product in the pathway.'
