caption: PAEC and PASMC Piezo1 current in an early stage of CH-PH. Piezo1 activation
  increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in both PAECs and PASMCs.
  (A1) Yoda1 (20 μM) induced a sustained increase in Cal520 fluorescence in isolated
  PAECs from 1W-CH IPA that was reduced in presence of thapsigargin (2 µM) or in absence
  of extracellular calcium (0 Ca2+). (A2) Typical trace of calcium increase recorded
  in the presence of Yoda1 in Nx PASMCs that was reduced in presence of thapsigargin
  (2 µM) or in absence of extracellular calcium (0 Ca2+). (B) Statistical analysis
  of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by Yoda1 (20 μM) in ECs from Nx and 1W-CH IPA (n
  represents the number of analyzed cells, five different rats at least). Absence
  of extracellular calcium (0 Ca2+), presence of GdCl3 (Gd3+, 100 µM), or thapsigargin
  (2 µM) inhibited the response. (C) Statistical analysis of the [Ca2+]i increase
  induced by ACh (10 μM) in PAECs from Nx and 1W-CH IPA. (D) Statistical analysis
  of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by Yoda1 (20 μM) in PASMCs from Nx and 1W-CH IPA.
  The absence of extracellular calcium (0 Ca2+), presence of GdCl3 (Gd3+, 100 µM),
  or thapsigargin (2 µM) inhibited the response, whereas nicardipine (1 μM; L-type
  voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor) did not blunt the response. * p  <  0.05.
  n represented the number of analyzed cells, five different rats at least.
