figure_title: Ras/MAPK pathway stabilized suspended HCC cell lines and avoid killing
  of leukocytes
caption: 'Cells were divided in 4 groups: (a) cultured without suspension (b) cultured
  with suspension (c) cultured without suspension, 10 µM of AZ628 were used for Ras/MAPK
  pathway inhibition(d) cultured with suspension, 10 µM of AZ628 were used for Ras/MAPK
  pathway inhibition. Cells in different group were detected in (A) phosphorylation
  of ERK by Western blot, (B) cell cycle by flow cytometry, (C) DNA synthesis by EDU,
  (D) apoptosis by flow cytometry and (E) Cyclin, CDK4 and PARP by Western blot. F
  Immunofluorescence was used in determining interactions between MHCC97H and leukocyte
  with or without Ras/MAPK inhibitor. Data of flow cytometry are shown as the mean ± SD,
  n = 3. *P < 0.05.'
