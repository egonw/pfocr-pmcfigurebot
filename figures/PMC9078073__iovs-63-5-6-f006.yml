caption: 'MLT attenuated apoptosis in LPS-stimulated HMGECs. The HMGECs were treated
  with MLT for 48 hours followed by LPS for 24 hours. The undifferentiated group was
  not treated with the differentiated medium. (A) Images of phospho-histone H2A.X
  foci in HMGECs depicted by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar: 20 µm. (B) Representative
  protein bands of phospho-histone H2A.X. (C) Quantitative intensity of phospho-histone
  H2A.X (n = 4). (D) Images of cleaved caspase 3 in HMGECs obtained by immunofluorescence
  staining. (E) Fluorescence intensity quantitation of cleaved caspase 3 (n = 3).
  Scale bar: 20 µm. (F) Representative protein bands of cleaved caspase 3, Bax, and
  Bcl-2. (G, H) Quantitative intensity of cleaved caspase 3 (G) and Bax/Bcl-2 (H)
  (n = 4). ***Significantly different from control, ***P < 0.001. ##Significantly
  different from LPS group, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
