caption: 'Influence of oxycodone on the mifepristone‐mediated regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2/HO‐1
  signal pathway in human endometrial stromal cells (hEndoSCs). hEndoSCs were treated
  with mifepristone, followed by treatment with 1, 5, or 10 μg/mL oxycodone for different
  time periods. (A) The protein expression of Keap1, Nrf2, HO‐1, and NQO1 was assessed
  by western blot analysis. (B–E) Quantification of Keap1, Nrf2, HO‐1, and NQO1. Reverse
  transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of Keap1 (F), Nrf2
  (G), HO‐1 (H), and NQO1 (I) levels. N = 3. **p < .01 versus Control; #, ##p < .05,
  .01 versus the mifepristone group. Experiments were repeated three times, and the
  data were presented as means ± SD.'
