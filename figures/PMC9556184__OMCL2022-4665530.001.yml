caption: The potential roles of VDACs in PD. (a) VDAC1 polyubiquitination induces
  mitophagy, thereby promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons by regulating
  the PINK1/Parkin pathway in PD. (b) VDAC1 monoubiquitination inhibits apoptosis,
  thereby promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons by regulating the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway in PD. (c) VDAC1 binding to Bcl-2 blocked Cyt c into the cytoplasm and inhibits
  apoptosis, thereby promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons in PD. (d) VDAC1
  binding to Bax promotes Cyt c into the cytoplasm and activates apoptosis, thereby
  inducing the death of dopaminergic neurons. (e) VDAC1 or VDAC3 interacting with
  Î±-syn promotes calcium influx and triggered mPTP, thereby inducing the death of
  dopaminergic neurons. (f) VDAC3 ubiquitination induces mitophagy, thereby promoting
  the survival of dopaminergic neurons by regulating the PINK1/Parkin pathway in PD.
  (g) Dissociation of VDAC2 and Bak induces Cyt c release and promotes apoptosis.
  (h) VDAC1 oligomerization regulates mPTP to promote apoptosis.
