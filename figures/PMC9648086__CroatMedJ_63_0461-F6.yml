caption: Expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated, ER stress-mediated
  apoptosis, and autophagy-related genes. The expression levels of (A) ER stress related
  genes, (B) ER stress-mediated apoptosis genes, and (C) ER stress-mediated autophagy
  genes were analyzed with real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in unsorted,
  CD133+, and CD133- groups. Each group was compared with the control group. Data
  are representative of three independent experiments, and the values are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for
  multiple comparisons, *** P < 0.001, n = 6/group).
