caption: Altered feeding response in pyrantel-resistant BCR isolate. (A) General activation
  pathway. (B) Hookworm iL3 from each isolate were incubated in medium alone (NA),
  serum stimulus (ACT) or 15 mm 8-bromo-cGMP for 24 h, after which the number of activated
  (feeding) iL3 was determined. Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice,
  so that each value is the mean ± s.d. of 9 replicates, and analysed by pairwise
  ANOVA. ****P < 0.0001. mGC, membrane guanylyl cyclase; MuscR, muscarinic receptor;
  InsR, insulin receptor, FOXO, forkhead transcription factor.
