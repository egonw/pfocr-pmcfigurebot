caption: PD signaling pathway. KEGG enrichment analysis identified that genes that
  were significantly down-regulated in PD patients compared with NC were enriched
  in the PD signaling pathway. The red boxes indicate the main components in the PD
  signaling pathway. KEGG = the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathway, NCs = normal
  controls, PD = Parkinson disease.
