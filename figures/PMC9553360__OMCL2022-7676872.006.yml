caption: 'Pb-exposure induced gut dysbiosis are tightly associated with cognitive
  deficits in mice. (a) Network analysis at the genus level. V: number of nodes. E:
  number of edges. (b) Gut bacteria with different abundances. (c) Lefse analysis
  of the three groups. (d) Relationship of bacteria with different abundances. (e)
  Heatmap of Spearman''s rank correlation coefficients between serum lead, freeze
  time in context, freeze time in conditioning stimulus, and gut bacteria abundance.
  n = 8 in control, n = 9 in low dose Pb exposure group, and n = 8 in low dose Pb
  exposure group. ∗P < 0.05.∗∗P < 0.01.'
