caption: Pathway analysis of metabolites that altered in roots and leaves at day 0,
  day 3 and day 5 following SWE treatment. Out of 89 compounds of interest, 62 compounds
  were found in the KEGG pathway database, which was used to create this figure. The
  remaining 27 compounds are not shown in the figure. Log2FC data were used to represent
  the accumulation of the compounds (red color), or reduced accumulation (blue color),
  or no statistical change (white) of compounds.
