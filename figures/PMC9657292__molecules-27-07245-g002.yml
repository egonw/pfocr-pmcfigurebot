caption: ACN induced apoptosis in 4T1 BC cells through a caspase-dependent pathway.
  Cleaved and total caspase-3 protein levels and ratio of cleaved caspase-3 to total
  caspase-3 (A). Total PARP protein levels (B). Cells starved overnight were treated
  with ACN (IC50) in 2.5% FBS supplemented culture medium for 48 h. Cell lysates were
  subjected to immunoblot analysis with primary and secondary antibodies as detailed
  in materials and methods. Western blots are representative of at least two independent
  experiments (upper panels). Band intensities of target proteins determined with
  ImageJ software were divided by band intensity of β-actin, and values were normalized
  to untreated control (lower panels). Data from relative band intensity are mean
  ± SEM. The unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used to determine significance
  (*** p < 0.001).
