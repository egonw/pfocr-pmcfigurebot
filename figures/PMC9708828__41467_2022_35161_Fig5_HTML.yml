figure_title: Rational engineering of RAPA- and GA-regulated OCARs by C to S site-directed
  mutagenesis in CID domains
caption: 'a Left: structural architectures of the initial, non-mutagenized constructs
  pPW108 (PPGK-SS-FKBP-(GGGS)x2-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA), pPW109 (PPGK-SS-FRB-(GGGS)x2-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA),
  pPW112, and pPW113. “L” symbolizes a flexible linker. Right: SEAP levels in supernatants
  of HEK-293 cells transfected with pPW108, pPW109, pPW112, and pPW113 using either
  WT and/or different C to S mutants (40 ng each). Data are presented as mean ± SD
  of n = 4 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed,
  unpaired Student’s t-test. b SEAP levels in the supernatants of co-cultured cells.
  Receiver cells were transfected with different amounts of pPW113 and pPW112C22S
  either separately or in combination (see methods). Sender cells were separately
  transfected either with pPW112C22S or pPW113. RAPA and DMSO were immediately added
  to the mixed cells, and SEAP measurements were performed 24 h following the co-culturing.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001
  was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. c Systematic C to S
  mutagenesis of pPW124 (PPGK-SS-GID1-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-pA). Cells were transfected
  with pMMH130 (PPGK-SS-GAIWT-Notch1core-pA) and different C to S mutants of pPW124
  (40 ng each). SEAP levels were measured at 24 h after GA (100 µM) treatment. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001
  was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. d Combinatory C to S
  mutagenesis analysis of pPW124 and SEAP was measured as described in (c). Data are
  presented as mean ± SD of n = 6 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001
  was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. e SEAP levels in the
  supernatants of co-cultured cells. Sender cells were transfected with pMMH130 and
  receiver cells were transfected with different amounts of pPW124C155S, C157S, C362S.
  GA was used as the inducer. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically
  independent samples. ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
  t-test. Source data are provided as a  file.'
