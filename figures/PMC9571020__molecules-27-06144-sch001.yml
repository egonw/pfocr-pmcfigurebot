caption: The enzymatic biosynthesis of dfoE (1) from HSC (6) progresses through dfoD
  and dfoG1 (3) as individual condensation products and overall intermediates. DesD
  is the enzyme catalyst, and ATP is the coupled cofactor that loses pyrophosphate
  to yield activated AMP esters for acyl transfer.
