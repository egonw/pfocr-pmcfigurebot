caption: 'Effect of ZGZT on serum levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and
  IL-17. (A) The expression level of TNF-α increased in the PMOP group, decreased
  in the PMOP + ZGZT group, and showed no significant change in the PMOP + E2 group;
  (B) compared with the control group, the expression level of IL-1β in the PMOP group
  increased, while that in the PMOP + ZGZT group decreased, and there was no significant
  change in the PMOP + E2 group; (C) the expression of IL-17 in both the PMOP group
  and the PMOP + E2 group was decreased, and the expression level was similar, and
  the expression level of PMOP + ZGZT group was lower than that of the PMOP group.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, compared with control group; #P<0.05, compared with the PMOP
  group. TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; IL-17, interleukin
  17; PMOP, postmenopausal osteoporosis; ZGZT, Zhuanggu Zhitong; E2, estrogen.'
