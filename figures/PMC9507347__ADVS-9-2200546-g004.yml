caption: Abundant FBN1 in the stroma promotes tumor proliferation through the LTBP1–integrin–TGF–β1
  pathway. A) KEGG enrichment analysis of FBN1‐related signaling pathways. B) Integrin
  β3, integrin β5, and PI3K/Akt signal pathway protein levels in MKN45, MKN45 with
  Hs738, and MKN45 with cancer‐associated fibroblast (CAF) groups. C) Detection of
  TGF‐β1 protein level in indicated groups. Coomassie brilliant blue staining results
  were used as the control. D) Proliferation of MKN45 cells analyzed by plate colony
  formation assays. E) Zebrafish cell line‐derived xenograft (zCDX) assays of the
  proliferation of MKN45 cells in the indicated four groups. The cells were separately
  treated with IgG and K672suc monoantibody (n = 300).
