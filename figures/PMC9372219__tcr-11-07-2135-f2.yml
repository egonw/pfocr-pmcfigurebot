caption: IHC results of HNRNPM in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue microarray. Examples
  of IHC staining of HNRNPM in (A) hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and (B) normal
  liver tissues (left, 40×, right 200×). (C) Protein expression patterns of HNRNPM
  in HCC tissues as compared to normal liver tissues (****, P<0.0001). (D) HNRNPM
  was overexpressed in patients over 60 than in patients under 60 years old. (E) HNRNPM
  was overexpressed in male patients than in female patients. IHC, immunohistochemistry;
  HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
article_title: Downregulation of HNRNPM inhibits cell proliferation and migration
  of hepatocellular carcinoma through MAPK/AKT signaling pathway.
