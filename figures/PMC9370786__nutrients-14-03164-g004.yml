caption: 'Effects of A. muciniphila colonization on the mRNA levels of inflammatory
  cytokines and NF-kB signaling pathway protein expression in the jejunum of mice
  under high fructose and restraint stress. (a) The expression of mRNA levels of inflammatory
  cytokine Tnf-a, Il-6, Il-1b, Mcp-1, Il-17a and Il-10 in the C, S, H and H + S groups.
  (n = 9). (b) Expression of mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine Tnf-a, Il-6, Il-1b
  and Il-10 in the C, ABX, AKK, H + S, ABX + HS and AKK + HS groups. (n = 9). (c)
  The expression levels of NF-kB signaling pathway proteins p-P65, p-IkB and β-actin
  were examined by Western blotting in the C, S, H, H + S groups. (d) The relative
  protein levels were normalized to β-actin (n = 5). (e) The expression of NF-kB signaling
  pathway proteins p-P65, p-IkB and β-actin were examined by Western blotting. (f,g)
  The relative protein levels were normalized to β-actin in the C (red), ABX (tangerine),
  AKK (green), H + S (blue), ABX + HS (rose red) and AKK + HS (black) groups (n =
  5). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
  indicate significant difference. C: control group; S: restraint stress; H: high
  fructose; H + S: high fructose and restraint stress; ABX: antibiotic treatment group;
  AKK: A. muciniphila colonization group; ABX + HS: antibiotic treatment + high fructose
  and restraint stress group; AKK + HS: A. muciniphila colonization + high fructose
  and restraint stress group.'
