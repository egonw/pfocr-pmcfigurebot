caption: 'Three-dimensional visualization of whole mouse brain after 12 mpt. (A–D)
  Image representing a 3D reconstruction of the graft projections after the acquisition
  with a light sheet microscope of a mouse hemisphere cleared by the iDISCO technique
  at 12 mpt. (A) Representative image of the 3D visualization of the nigrostriatal
  pathway. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) High magnification of dotted square in A showing
  hNCAM/TH+ fibers in the nigrostriatal pathway. Scale bar: 100 μm. (C) Representative
  image of the 3D visualization of the graft projections within the CPu. Scale bar:
  150 μm. (D) High magnification of dotted square in C showing hNCAM/TH+ fibers in
  the dST. Scale bar: 100 μm. (E,F) Representative images of triple DAT/TH/hNCAM labeling
  in the graft (E) and along the nigrostriatal pathway (F) on brain sections at 12
  mpt. Scale bars: 50 μm. CC: corpus callosum, CPu: caudate putamen, Cx: cortex, dST:
  dorsal striatum, mfb: medial forebrain bundle.'
