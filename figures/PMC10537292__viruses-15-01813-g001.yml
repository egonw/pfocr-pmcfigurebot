caption: Regulation of Foxp3 expression. Foxp3 expression was assessed by flow cytometry
  in LM3 cells incubated for 24 h in the presence of 10 ng/mL of recombinant TGF-β
  (A), 50 μM of the mTOR pathway inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) (B), or 50 μM of the COX-2
  inhibitor indomethacin (INDO) (C). Representative histograms are shown. The histograms
  of cells incubated with isotype controls are shown in gray. * p < 0.05 vs control
  (Student’s t-test). (D) TNBC subtype EO771 breast cancer cells and (E) HER2+ LM3
  breast cancer cells were incubated with 2 or 20 μM cisplatin for 48 h and then Foxp3
  expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Representative histograms are shown.
  * p < 0.05, ANOVA.
