figure_title: Confirming overexpression of CBK1
caption: The relative transcript levels of the CBK1 gene in the cbk1Δ, CBK1OE strain
  compared to in the wild-type (WT) strain was assayed by RT-PCR. The transcript level
  of CBK1 in the WT strain background was set to 1 for normalization. The housekeeping
  gene TEF1 was used as an endogenous control. Three biological and three technical
  replicates were used for each sample. Student’s t-test was used to determine significance
  level. ‘****’ refers to a p</i>-value<0.0001.
