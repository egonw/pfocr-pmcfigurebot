caption: Mechanisms of action of potential ncRNA-based immunotherapeutics. Several
  ncRNA-centered immunotherapies have been developed. The TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling pathway
  can inhibit the expression of T-bet and IFN-γ, thereby blunting NK cell activity.
  CD56-NP-miR-186 improves NK cytotoxicity by targeting TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. siPD-L1@PLGA
  suppresses IFN-γ-mediated PD-L1 induction and induces local expansion of CD8+ T
  cells. pCD28-siRNA-PD-1 can increase CD28 expression and reduce PD-1 expression.
  It also induces antitumor immune responses by increasing the populations of CD4+
  T cells and CD8+ T cells while repressing Treg expansion. EVs/siCD38 impedes CD38-mediated
  adenosine generation and facilitates macrophage repolarization toward tumor-suppressive
  M1-like phenotype. CD.siRNA.stearic acid-PEG-SA induces the reprograming of M2 macrophages
  to M1 phenotype by silencing CSF-1R. These ncRNA-based approaches can reverse cancer
  resistance to conventional immunotherapies and hold great promise for the clinical
  use in cancer treatment. IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TGFBR1, transforming growth factor-β
  receptor 1; TGFBR2, transforming growth factor-β receptor 2; NK cell, natural killer
  cell; Treg, regulatory T cell; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; IFNγR, interferon-γ
  receptor; PD-L1, programmed cell death-ligand 1; PD-1, programmed cell death protein-1;
  MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressive cell; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; CSF-1R,
  colony stimulating factor-1 receptor.
