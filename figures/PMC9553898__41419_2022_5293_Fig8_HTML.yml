figure_title: A possible scheme depicting the role of mTORC1 signaling in estrogen-induced
  epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in mouse vagina
caption: A mTORC1 signaling participates in the proliferation and differentiation
  of vaginal epithelium by promoting the expression level of PR and EREG-YAP1 in Rptorfl/fl
  mice. B Loss of Rptor compromises the estrogen-induced proliferation and differentiation
  of vaginal epitheliums through down-regulating the expression of PR and EREG.

  vaginal epithelial cells proliferation and differentiation.
