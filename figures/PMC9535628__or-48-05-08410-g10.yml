caption: miR-608 knockdown reverses the effects of circ_0026652 knockdown on the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (A) Protein expression levels of WNT3A and β-catenin in U266 cells in the
  control, si-NC + NC-inhibitor, si-NC + miR-inhibitor, si-circ + NC-inhibitor and
  si-circ + miR-inhibitor groups. (B) Protein expression levels of WNT3A and β-catenin
  in RPMI-8226 cells in the control, si-NC + NC-inhibitor, si-NC + miR-inhibitor,
  si-circ + NC-inhibitor and si-circ + miR-inhibitor groups. miR, microRNA; circ,
  circular RNA; si, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; WNT3A, Wnt family
  member 3A.
article_title: Dysregulated circular RNAs are closely linked to multiple myeloma prognosis,
  with circ_0026652 predicting bortezomib-based treatment response and survival via
  the microRNA-608-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
