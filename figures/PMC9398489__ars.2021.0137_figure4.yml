caption: 'IF1 and mitochondrial fitness. (a) Cellular adaptation to stress and tumorigenesis—IF1-mediated
  mild mitochondrial ROS production has a protective role by promoting stress adaptation,
  survival, and proliferation through the activation of the NF-κB pathway, Nrf2 pathway,
  Bcl-xl, AMPK, and Akt; this mechanism can act as a physiological cellular response,
  but it can contribute to tumorigenesis. (b) Metabolic by-products: NAD+/NADH redox
  state and α-ketoglutarate: In primary human skeletal cells that overexpressed IF,
  the decreased ratio of NAD+/NADH was observed, together with a decrease in the cellular
  level of α-ketoglutarate and impaired fatty acid oxidation. (c) Mitochondrial cristae
  remodeling—IF1 can have a beneficial role in the density of mitochondrial cristae
  by promoting the dimerization of the ATP synthase; however, several studies disprove
  this hypothesis. (d) Mitophagy—Under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization
  induced by CCCP (a widely used inducer of mitophagy), the hydrolytic activity of
  ATP synthase promoted the loss of ΔΨm and subsequent PINK1 accumulation and Parkin
  recruitment, followed by mitophagy; this process is inhibited in the absence of
  IF1 in cells. Akt, protein kinase b; AMPK, 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase; CCCP,
  carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone; Nrf2, NF-E2 p45-related factor 2; PINK1,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog. Color images are available online.'
