caption: Snake venom induces autophagic flux in lung cancer cells. (A and B) SW480
  cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom for 24 h in the absence or presence
  of the lysosomal inhibitor HCQ (5 μM) for 3 h. LC3 levels were evaluated by immunoblotting
  (A) or immunocytochemistry (B). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. (C) SW480
  cells were treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom and were then stained with CYTO-ID for
  1 h at 37°C in the dark. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. (D) SW480 cells
  were incubated with RFP-GFP-LC3B for 24 h and then treated with 1 μg/ml snake venom.
  The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
