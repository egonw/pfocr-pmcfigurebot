caption: 'MG53 pretreatment improves the therapeutic effect of senescent hUC-MSCs
  on AD mice. (A) Escape latency, (B) crossing numbers, (C) time spent in the target
  quadrant in MWM test. (D) Discrimination index in the NOR test. (E) Representative
  images of Nissl staining and (F) Quantitative analysis of surviving neurons. Scale
  bar = 100 μm. (G) Representative immunofluorescence images of NeuN and (H) Quantitative
  analysis of NeuN+ cells. (I) Representative Tunel staining images and (J) Tunel + cells.
  Scale bar = 200 μm. Cell nuclear (blue) was labeled by DAPI. Data were presented
  as mean ± SEM. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 4 per group. *: Compared with
  AD group, P < 0.05; #: Compared with P15 MSCs group, P < 0.05. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
