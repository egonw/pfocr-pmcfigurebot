caption: ZKSCAN3 induces chromosomal instability by suppressing MAD2L2 expression.
  (A) CBMN assays for the indicated cells derived from single cells after 40−50 generations.
  A total of 800 binucleated cells (BNC) were scored for nuclear abnormalities. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD. * Statistical significance was determined using one-way
  ANOVA followed by Duncan’s test (* p < 0.01). (B) FISH analysis of interphase cells
  using CEP probes. Average 300−500 cells were scored for each cell line; data are
  expressed as the percentage of aneuploid cells. (C) Fluorescence microscopy images
  of interphase FISH for indicated cells using probes for chromosomes 7, 12, and 17.
  Aneuploid cells (arrowhead). Optical magnification, ×600. CBMN, cytokinesis-block
  micronucleus.
