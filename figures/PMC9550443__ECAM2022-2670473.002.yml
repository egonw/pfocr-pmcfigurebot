caption: 'Effect of CHSSC on the expression of CaMKII, p-CaMKII, RyR2, and p-RyR2
  in rats with myocardial ischemia. (a) Western blot analysis of the expression levels
  of p-CaMKII, CaMKII, and RyR2. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used
  as the loading control. (b) Quantitative analysis of the relative expression levels
  of p-CaMKII. (c) Quantitative analysis of the relative expression levels of CaMKII.
  (d) Quantitative analysis of the relative expression levels of p-RyR2. (e) Quantitative
  analysis of the relative expression levels of RyR2. N = 3 mice per group. All data
  are expressed as means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the sham operation
  group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs. the model group.'
