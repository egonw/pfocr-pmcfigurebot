caption: Single-cell transcriptional profile analyses of different cell types with
  Que treatment. (A) Workflow showing the procedure of scRNA-seq, phenotypic analysis,
  and mechanism verification of hair growth activated by topical application of Que.
  (B) UMAP plot showing the fifteen cell types in mouse skin. Cells types are annotated
  on the right. BC, basal cell; MC, mitotic basal cell; SC, spinous cell; GC, granular
  cell; UHF, upper HF cell; HFB, HF bulge cell; GL, germ layer cell; SG, sebaceous
  gland cell; EC, endothelial cell; SM, smooth muscle cell; FB, fibroblast cell; Mac1,
  Macrophage 1; Mac2, Macrophage 2; LC, Langerhans cell; TC, T cells. (C) Dot plots
  showing the expression of representative genes for each cell type in skin. (D) Heatmaps
  showing the expression profiles of differentially expressed genes along the time
  trajectory (TDEGs) for different cell types in vehicle- and Que-treated groups,
  which were divided into four clusters based on the expression pattern. Representative
  GO terms and pathways of TDEGs in the corresponding clusters are shown on the right.
  (E) Violin plots showing gene set scores of cell cycle and BMP pathway in different
  cell types of vehicle- and Que-treated groups. (F) Plots showing the continuously
  downregulated TDEGs (left, module 1) shared by at least four cell types and consistently
  upregulated TDEGs (right, module 4) shared by at least five cell types.
