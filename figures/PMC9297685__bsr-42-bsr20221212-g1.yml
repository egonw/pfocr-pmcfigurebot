figure_title: Insulin receptor family signalling
caption: (A) Insulin receptors (INSRs, black) and the related receptor family members,
  IGF1 receptors (IGF1Rs, blue) and insulin receptor-related receptors (INSRRs, yellow)
  are expressed at the cell surface as preformed heterotetramers, each comprising
  two hemi-receptors composed of one α- and one β-subunit. Each α- and β-subunit and
  the two α-subunits are cross-linked by disulphide bridges. The extracellular α subunits
  bind insulin or IGFs as indicated or are responsive to alkaline pHo. The β-subunits
  have a tyrosine kinase domain (red). Alternative splicing generates two isoforms
  of INSR, INSR-A and INSR-B, without or with (respectively) exon 11 (pink). Hybrid
  receptors can form between the family members. IGF2 also binds to the cation-independent
  mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) that directs IGF2 and other molecules to
  the lysosome for degradation. (B) Insulin or IGFs bind to INSRs/IGF1Rs causing receptor
  phosphorylation and full activation of the tyrosine kinase, with additional phosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues (pY) on the β-subunit. These recruit adapter proteins including
  insulin receptor substrates (IRS) that become phosphorylated. IRS proteins recruit
  phosphoinositide 3′ kinase (PI3K) that stimulates production of phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5 tris phosphate in the membrane (red lipids), recruiting PDK1 and protein kinase
  B (PKB, also known as Akt). PDK1 phosphorylates PKB/Akt on Thr308. In some cells,
  INSRs/IGF1Rs also signal via Grb2 and the exchange factor Sos to the small G protein
  Ras. Activated Ras recruits Raf kinases that phosphorylate and activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinases 1/2 (MKK1/2) that phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). However, this pathway is not thought to be activated significantly
  in the heart and is shaded. (C) (i) PKB/Akt(T308) phosphorylates AS160 (Tbc1d4)
  to increase translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the membrane for glucose
  uptake. Phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) results
  in activation of glycogen synthase (GS) to increase glycogen synthesis. Other GSK3
  substrates influence apoptosis, metabolism and cardiac hypertrophy. (ii) PKB/Akt(T308)
  activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Signalling
  via p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) increases ribosome biogenesis by increasing
  translation of RNAs with 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) sequences), phosphorylation
  of Rps6 and regulation of other eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). mTORC1-dependent
  phosphorylation of 4E-BP causes it to dissociate from eIF4E that is then available
  to bind to the 5′ cap structure of mRNAs to increase translation and enhance protein
  synthesis. (iii) PKB/Akt(T308) is phosphorylated on Ser473 in mTORC2. Dually phosphorylated
  PKB/Akt(T308/S473) has greater activity and additional target specificity for forkhead
  transcription factors of the FoxO family. Phosphorylation of FoxO transcription
  factors inhibits their effects on gene expression, to influence apoptosis and metabolism.
