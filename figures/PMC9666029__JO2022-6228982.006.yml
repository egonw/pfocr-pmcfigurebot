caption: The effect of LINC01279 knockdown on the growth of GC cells (SGC-7901) in
  nude mice. (a) The timeline of subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice; (b) the
  tumors formed under the nude mice's skin, 30 d after inoculation of SGC-7901 cells
  with different treatments; (c) the tumors were measured and analyzed; (d) after
  scarification, the tissue of the tumor was stripped and weighed, and the weight
  of the tumors were analyzed; (e) fluorescence qPCR analyzes the LINC01279 expression
  level of in tumors. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗P < 0.05.
