caption: Identification of two prognostic chordoma subtypes with tumor DNA methylation
  signatures. (A) Unsupervised learning cluster identified two skull-base subtypes
  in the 46 DNA methylation samples with the most variable 10,000 probes. Color annotations
  display the distribution of clinical features (sex, age, extent of surgery, adjuvant
  radiotherapy, and the recurrence status). (B) Principle component analysis results
  of the cohort samples showed that the samples within cluster 1 were well separated
  from the samples within cluster 2, with the top 10,000 most variable methylated
  probes. (C) Kaplan–Meier plot showing cluster 1 had a worse disease-specific survival
  time when compared with cluster 2 (p< 0.01). (D) Volcano plot showing 1,496 probes
  with differentially methylated promoters between cluster 1 and cluster 2. (E) Gene
  set enrichment analysis revealing the activated and suppressed pathways within hallmark
  gene sets in cluster 1 when compared with cluster 2. The early and late estrogen
  response pathways and the hypoxia pathway were activated, whereas the inflammatory
  and interferon gamma responses were suppressed in cluster 1 (adjusted p< 0.05).
