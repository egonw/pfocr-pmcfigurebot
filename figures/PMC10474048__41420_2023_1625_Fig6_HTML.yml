figure_title: Knockdown of KIF15 inhibited tumor growth in vivo
caption: A The tumor growth curve showed that the knockdown of KIF15 significantly
  inhibited tumor growth. B It could be observed from the removed xenografts that
  the volume of xenografts in the shKIF15 groups was distinctly smaller than that
  of the shCtrl group. C The weight of xenografts was obtained after the removal of
  xenografts. D, E Fluorescence imaging showed that the total fluorescence intensity
  in shKIF15 mice was significantly lower than that of the shCtrl group. F Compared
  with the shCtrl group, KIF15 protein expression in the shKIF15 group was significantly
  down-regulated. G–I After the collection of xenografts, a tumor section was prepared
  for the detection of Ki67, KIF15, p-PI3K, and p-Akt by IHC analysis. Data were shown
  as Mean with SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
