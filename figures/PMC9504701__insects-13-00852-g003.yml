caption: Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) metabolites in S. frugiperda to
  spinetoram stress. (A) Numbers of metabolites that were up-regulated (red) and down-regulated
  (green) in spinetoram-stressed fall armyworm larvae. (Bâ€“E) Heatmaps of DE metabolites
  in fall armyworm at pos-mode (B,C) and neg-mode (D,E) after spinetoram stress. Each
  column represents one sample, and each row represents one DE metabolite. Red color
  represents the relative level of the up-regulated metabolites, and green color represents
  down-regulation Metabolic pathway analysis.
