caption: 'The effect of inhibition of miR-93-5p on the ferroptosis in GC. (A, B) The
  ROS level between the si-NC, si-miR93-5p and treated with erastin (2, 20, and 100
  μM) groups. (C) MDA assay was used to detect lipid peroxidation in the presence
  of erastin (2, 20, and 100 μM) in the si-miR93-5p group. GPX4 (D), SLC7A11 (E) and
  Nrf2 (F) mRNA expression was assessed by qRT–PCR in the presence of erastin (2,
  20, and 100 μM) in the si-miR93-5p group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001
  compared with the si-NC group. ***p < 0.001 compared with the si-miR93-5p group.
  ns means no statistical difference. GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; SLC7A11, solute
  carrier family member 11; MDA, malondialdehyde; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
