caption: miR-140-3p inhibits the inflammatory reaction of ASMCs induced by PDGF-BB.
  ELISA was used to detect the levels of A. IL-1β, B. IL-6, and C. TNF-α in ASMC supernatants
  stimulated by 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB after transfection of miR-140-3p mimics or inhibitors.
  Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n=3). **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001,
  ASMCs; Airway smooth muscle cells, PDGF-BB; Platelet-derived growth factor, ELISA;
  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IL-1β; Interleukin-1β, and TNF-α; Tumor necrosis
  factor-α.
