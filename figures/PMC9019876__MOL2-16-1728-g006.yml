caption: Pharmacologic inhibition of DCZ0415 decreases malignant phenotypes of CRC.
  (A) MTT assay showing viability of CRC cells exhibiting various genetic alterations
  after treatment with serially diluted DCZ0415 concentrations. The heat map was plotted
  to show the viability of CRC cells after treatment with DCZ0415 at 4 days. (B) PCNA
  protein expression was analysed in CRC cells after treatment with DCZ0415 for 48 h.
  (C) Colony formation assay with CRC cells treated with 5, 10 or 20 µm DCZ0415. (D)
  Cell cycle analysis was performed in CRC cells after treatment with DCZ0415 for
  24 h. The experiments had three replicates.

  and metastasis via inactivation of the FGFR4/STAT3 axis and the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway
  in colorectal cancer.
