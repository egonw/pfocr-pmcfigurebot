caption: Changes of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway related proteins in AGS and HGC27 cells
  treated with compounds C5 or C8 for 48 h. (A) The expression of PI3KCA, AKT, and
  p-AKT of AGS or HGC27 cells was inhibited after treatment with compound C5 or C8
  for 48 h at 5 μM. (B) Changes of PI3KCA, AKT, and p-AKT protein expression levels
  on AGS and HGC27 cells, after treatment with 5 μM of compounds C5 and C8, for 48
  h. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared to negative DMSO control group.
