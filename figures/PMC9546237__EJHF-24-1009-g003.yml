caption: Pathway level overlaps between survival‐related genes and the protein targets
  of drugs that reverse the survival‐related gene expression signature in vitro. A
  network of significant pathways (p = 10−18–10−4) was derived using metascape.org.
  The input genes were the 120 chronic heart failure (CHF) survival‐associated genes
  used to identify drugs that regulate the CHF signature in vitro (https://clue.io/)
  and the 47 protein targets of the 29 drugs (identified using PubChem and the small‐molecule
  suite) that reverse the CHF signature in vitro. There are two identical plots. The
  large plot, on the left‐hand side, presents the significant pathways for this combined
  gene list. Edges represent connected gene ontology biological processes (>0.3),
  and nodes within each cluster are coloured/named by their most statistically enriched
  gene ontology term, scaled in size by the total number of terms represented. The
  smaller plot, on the right‐hand side, is same network structure but now colour coded
  by input list membership. This identifies if the drug targets appear within CHF
  survival‐associated pathways (pathways common to Figure ) or whether the drug target
  falls within a pathway more indirectly connected with the patient transcriptomic
  signature. Each node is presented as a pie‐chart, with the ‘slices’ coloured and
  scaled to indicate which gene list the terms originate from, and what proportion
  the lists contribute to the ontology groupings.
