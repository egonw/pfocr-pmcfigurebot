caption: 'a Top: the domain architecture of the KEAP1 protein. KEAP1 consists of 624
  amino acids and has five discrete protein domains as follows: the N-terminal region;
  the Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad (BTB) domain, which contains Cys151; the intervening
  region (IVR), which contains a group of cysteines important for stress sensing,
  including Cys273 and Cys288; and a double glycine repeat (DGR) and C-terminal region
  (CTR) domains, which collaborate to form a β-propeller structure, where KEAP1 interacts
  with NRF2 and makes up the Kelch domain (KLD). a Bottom: the methylation analysis
  of the CpG islands of KEAP1 in lung cancer cells. Panel b shows the domain architecture
  of the NRF2 protein. NRF2 consists of 605 amino acids and has evolutionarily highly
  conserved domains, Neh 1–7: Neh 1 is the binding site for ARE; Neh 2 serves as the
  binding site for KEAP1; Neh 3–5 are transactivation domains for NRF2; Neh 6 is a
  serine-rich domain that negatively controls the NRF2 stability by β-TrCP interactions;
  and Neh 7 interacts with RXRα, a nuclear receptor responsible for the suppression
  of NRF2/ARE signalling pathway.'
