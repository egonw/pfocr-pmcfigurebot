caption: Impact of arachidonic acid (AA) on the composition of lipid rafts in monocyte‐derived
  macrophages (MDMs). (A) Immunoblot analysis of membrane protein fractions obtained
  from MDMs after treatment with solvent or 50 µm AA. Membrane components were separated
  by ultracentrifugation (see  for details) and analyzed using antibodies for CD71
  (transferrin receptor) as a marker for proteins not enriched in lipid rafts, FLOT1
  (flotillin1) as a marker for lipid rafts and GAPDH as a cytosolic marker. The green
  arrow shows enrichment of FLOT1 in fraction 4, which was used for further analyses.
  (B) Effects of AA and 5,8,11,14‐eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) on the presence of
  proteins in lipid rafts identified by MS‐based proteomic analysis of fraction 4
  proteins. The plot shows all proteins with a |log2| difference > 2 (median of n = 5
  samples) in samples treated with AA or ETYA. Preprocessed data and results of the
  differential analysis are found in Table . (C) Proteins missing in lipid rafts isolated
  from cells treated with AA or ETYA (bottom left quadrant in panel A). Proteins associated
  with ‘IFN signaling’ and ‘cytokine signaling’ by Reactome pathway analysis (Table )
  are highlighted in red. (D) Verification of the AA‐triggered displacement of the
  IFN‐signaling‐associated proteins IFN‐γRα, JAK1 and JAK2 from lipid rafts by immunoblotting.
  (E) Quantification of n = 5 independent experiments as in panel D (five different
  donors; indicated by different symbols). Statistical significance was analyzed by
  paired t test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01). Horizontal lines indicate the median.
