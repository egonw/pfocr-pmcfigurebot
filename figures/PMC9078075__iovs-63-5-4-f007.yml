caption: PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002 reverses KAT5 overexpression-mediated
  phenotypes following induction AC in vivo. (A–E) The EAC mouse model was established
  followed by the indicated treatment. (A and B) The clinical score and permeability
  was analyzed. (C–E) The total IgE, OVA-specific IgE, and IgG1/IgG2a ratio were detected.
