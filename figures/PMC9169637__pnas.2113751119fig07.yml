caption: 'Schematic summary of results and signaling pathways. (A) Effects of myeloid
  cell–derived growth factors SDF1 and Ocm on optic nerve regeneration: cellular sources
  and responses of RGC subtypes. (A, Top) AAV2 expressing an shRNA to suppress Pten
  expression (AAV2-shPten) induces axon growth primarily from αRGCs () (green cells);
  the control AAV2-shLuciferase virus (AAV2-shLuc) has no effects. (A, Middle) SDF1,
  either as a recombinant protein (rSDF1) or via AAV2-mediated expression of monomeric
  SDF1 (AAV2-SDF1), induces moderate axon growth primarily from non-αRGCs (Middle
  Left, orange cells). SDF1 combined with Pten deletion enables non-αRGCs to regenerate
  lengthy axons but simultaneously suppresses the ability of αRGCs to respond to Pten
  deletion (Middle Right). (A, Bottom) Zymosan, by elevating levels of neutrophil/macrophage-derived
  Ocm, macrophage-derived SDF1, and other factors, stimulates regeneration from both
  αRGCs and non-αRGCs (Bottom Left); growth from both subtypes is strongly augmented
  by combining zymosan with Pten deletion (Bottom Right). (B) Signaling pathways activated
  by SDF1, Ocm, CPT-cAMP, and Pten deletion. SDF1 binds to its cognate G protein–coupled
  receptor CXCR4, thereby 1) activating adenylate cyclase (AC) to elevate cAMP and
  consequently PKA, which phosphorylates the Ocm receptor (Ocm-R, or a chaperone protein),
  causing it to translocate to the cell membrane (, ) (green arrows); 2) activating
  PI3K and its downstream effectors, including an AKT-dependent pathway (AKT, mTOR/S6K,
  to increase phosphorylation of ribosomal subunit pS6 and other substrates) and AKT-independent
  pathways () (dashed arrow); 3) besides cAMP generated downstream of SDF1, CPT-cAMP,
  a membrane-permeable, nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog, also activates PKA and potentiates
  the effects of Ocm; and 4) SDF1 antagonizes the repellent effects of slit/robo signaling
  at the optic chiasm and diencephalon (). The binding of Ocm to Ocm-R promotes axon
  growth via CaMKII and other kinases. Inhibiting CaMKII alone, or any combination
  of MAPK, JAK, and PI3K, blocks the effects of Ocm (, ). AAV2-shPten decreases Pten
  expression, thereby augmenting PIP3 phosphorylation and activating AKT, mTOR, and
  S6K. Pten deletion also promotes axon growth through AKT-independent pathways (e.g.,
  focal adhesion kinase, RAS, and others; not shown) (). Figure created with Biorender.com.'
