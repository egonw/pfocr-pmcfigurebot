figure_title: Virus and endogenous dsRNAs are generated by distinct RNAPII complexes
  that trigger separate arms of the siRNA pathway
caption: 'A)Abundance of siRNAs from Control (Loqs PB +/+/PD +/+) and Loqs-PD deficient
  (Loqs PB +/+/PD −/−) flies across the IIV-6 genome at 96 hpi. sRNAs mapping to IIV-6
  genome are represented as 8-bp bins.B )Correlation of siRNA density in control and
  Loqs-PD deficient flies at 48 and 96 hpi. Dots represent genomic regions and inter-regions.
  Pearson’s correlation for genomic regions and inter-regions are indicated in purple
  and yellow, respectively, in addition to all regions combined in black.C)Abundance
  of endogenous-siRNAs (endo-siRNA) from DM297, a transposable element, and two structured
  loci, AY119020 and CG18854, in Control and Loqs-PD deficient flies.D)Quantification
  of DM297, AY119020 and CG18854 transcripts in Control and α-aman-treated S2 cells.
  One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test (****p < 0.0001).E)Quantification of DM297, AY119020
  and CG18854 transcripts in Control and 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
  (DRB)-treated S2 cells by RT-qPCR. Unpaired t test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p
  < 0.001).F)Antisense and sense quantification of 206R transcripts by ssRT-qPCR in
  Control and DRB-treated S2 cells infected with IIV-6 at 6 hpi. Unpaired t test (ns:
  non-significant).G)Overview of activation of the siRNA pathway by IIV-6-derived
  and endogenous dsRNAs that are both products of host RNAPII.'
