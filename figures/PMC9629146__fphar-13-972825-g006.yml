caption: Targets of licoricidin inhibiting the growth of gastric cancer cells were
  identified by the quantitative proteomics research strategy of TMT labeling. MGC-803
  cells were treated with 10 μM of licoricidin or untreated as a control. After protein
  extraction, mass spectrometry identification, and database search, the differential
  proteins were screened out. Independent experiments were repeated three times. (A)
  Statistics of the protein identification results. (B) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed proteins. The significantly downregulated proteins are marked in blue
  (FC < 0.83 and p < 0.05), and strikingly up-regulated proteins are marked in red
  (FC > 1.2 and p < 0.05), while non-differentiated proteins are plotted in gray.
  (C) Hierarchical cluster classified proteins with differential expression and were
  displayed on the heatmap. The expression levels of significantly different proteins
  were normalized using the log2 method and revealed in different colors. The red
  and blue parts represent significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively.
  Domain enrichment (D) and GO molecular function enrichment (E) of differentially
  expressed proteins were analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. The closer to red color,
  the higher the enrichment degree. (F) Increased or decreased ICMT in different cancers
  was compared with that of paired normal tissues by gene expression profiling interactive
  analysis. (G) ICMT expression in different tumor types with or without paracancer
  determined by TIMER. (H) Three-dimensional structure of ICMT (PDB code:5V7P) was
  downloaded from Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/5V7P). (I) Licoricidin
  bound to the active site (TYR131 residue) of ICMT via forming a hydrogen bond in
  the molecular docking mode. The docking score was −9.165. (J) Expression level of
  ICMT in vitro was demonstrated by Western blot assay and normalized by β-tubulin
  for quantitative analysis. Independent experiments were repeated three times. Values
  are expressed as mean ± SD, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU,
  5-fluorouracil.
