figure_title: E. chaffeensis activates the Hh signaling pathway in THP-1 cells and
  primary human monocytes
caption: (A) Confocal microscopy of uninfected and E. chaffeensis infected THP-1 cells
  stained with anti-GLI-1 antibody at 2, 4, 10, 24 and 48 hpi, showing a temporal
  increase in GLI-1 compared to the uninfected controls. Uninfected and E. chaffeensis
  infected (MOI 100) THP-1 cells were stained with anti-Dsb antibody (red) at 2, 4,
  10, 24 and 48 hpi demonstrating infection of THP-1 cells with E. chaffeensis (scale
  bar = 10 μm). (B) Confocal microscopy of uninfected and E. chaffeensis-infected
  primary human monocytes at 10 hpi showing upregulation of GLI-1 (green). Uninfected
  and E. chaffeensis-infected primary human monocytes were stained with anti-Dsb antibody
  (red) to confirm E. chaffeensis infection (scale bar = 10 μm). (A-B) Experiments
  were performed with at least three biological and technical replicates. Randomized
  areas/slide (n = 10) were used to detect GLI-1 nuclear translocation. (C-D) Intensity
  graphs demonstrate the mean nuclear accumulation of GLI-1 in respective THP-1 cells
  and primary human monocytes. Analysis was performed using ImageJ and determining
  mean grey value from randomized areas/slide (n = 10).
