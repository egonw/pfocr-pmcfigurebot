caption: Nutrient availability drives the dynamic cycle of protein O-GlcNAcylation
  via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The GlcNAc provided by UDP-GlcNAc is necessary
  and unique for O-GlcNAcylation, and the only source of UDP-GlcNAc is HBP. Changes
  in nutritional availability, such as carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides
  and ATP, fluctuate HBP flux. Therefore, UDP-GlcNAc and HBP link carbohydrate metabolism,
  lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. These physiological
  characteristics make OGT extremely sensitive to nutrient fluctuations.
