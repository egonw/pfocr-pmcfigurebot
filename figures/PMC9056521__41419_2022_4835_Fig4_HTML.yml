figure_title: TGFβ signalling pathway is deregulated upon MCU knockdown
caption: A RNA-Seq heatmap (upper panel) showing hierarchical cluster of differentially
  expressed genes. Red represents high expression and blue represents low expression.
  Volcano plot (lower panel) shows distribution of differentially expressed genes
  upon MCU knockdown. B GO enrichment histogram showing top five significantly enriched
  biological processes upon MCU knockdown based on the number of differentially expressed
  genes. C KEGG enrichment histogram showing top five unique significantly enriched
  pathways upon MCU knockdown based on the number of differentially expressed genes.
  D A list of the top significantly altered genes in the TGFβ pathway identified by
  RNA-Seq analysis upon MCU knockdown are shown with the fold change and adjusted
  p values. E qPCR analysis for TGFβ1, TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 mRNA in control and siMCU
  cells. The values correspond to average ± SEM (n = 3). F Western blot analysis of
  control and shMCU cells using MCU, p-SMAD3 and SMAD3 antibodies. A representative
  western blot from three independent experiments is shown. G Control and shMCU cells
  were transfected with 200 ng of the TGFβ reporter p3TP-Lux and 5 ng Renilla luciferase.
  Cells were analysed for luciferase activity 48 h later. The values correspond to
  average ± SEM (n = 3). Two-tailed non-parametric unpaired t-test was performed for
  statistical analysis. ****p ≤ 0.0001.
