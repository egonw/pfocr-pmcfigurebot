caption: CTSB bound to TFAM and negatively regulated its expression. (a, b) Isolated
  PACs were pretreated with CA-074Me (10 μM) for 0.5 h and then stimulated with 200 nM
  CCK for 6 h. Immunoblot analysis and quantification of TFAM levels of PACs with
  CCK stimulation (n = 4 per group). (c, d) AP was induced by caerulein and LPS. CA-074Me
  was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the injection of caerulein. Immunoblot
  analysis and quantification of TFAM levels of pancreas in mice treated with caerulein
  and LPS (n=4 per group). (e) Isolated PACs were treated with LLOMe (0.5 mM) for
  6 h. Co-ip experiment results suggested TFAM protein bound to CTSB protein. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
