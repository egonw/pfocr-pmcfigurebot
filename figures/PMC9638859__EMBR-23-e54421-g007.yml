caption: 'A (left) Schematic depiction of Tamoxifen (OHT) inducible TNERT cell line.
  TNERT and TDiN (Fig ) are similar to NERTc3 and 44iN (Navarro et al, ), where the
  NANOG function is reinstated by 4‐Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) or Doxycycline, respectively,
  and endogenous Nanog gene activity is reported by GFP. (Middle) FACS profile of
  TNERT treated with OHT (red) or no OHT (blue). The dotted line represents the FACS
  profile of unstained E14Tg2a cells used as negative control (−ve c). (Right) Nanog:GFP
  population median of TNERT (n = 3).B FACS profiles of TNERT, and TDiN treated with
  2 μM SU5402, with OHT/Doxycycline (red) or no OHT/Doxycycline (blue) (n = 3). The
  dotted line represents the FACS profile of unstained E14Tg2a cells used as negative
  control (−ve c).C Heat map representing transcript levels (FPKM) of Fgfbp1 from
  8‐cell to blastocyst stage analyzed from the single‐cell sequencing data.D Schematic
  depiction of TNERTFgfr1−/−, TNERTFgfr2−/−, TNERTFgf4−/−, and TNERTFgfbp1−/− cell
  lines, which are derivatives of TNERT where Fgfr1, Fgfr2, Fgf4, and Fgfbp1 are knocked
  out, respectively.E FACS profiles of TNERT, TNERTFgfr1−/−, TNERTFgfr2−/−, TNERTFgf4−/−,
  and TNERTFgfbp1−/− cells, cultured in SL treated with OHT (red) or no OHT (blue)
  (n = 3). The dotted line represents the E14Tg2a FACS profile used as negative control
  (−ve c).F RT‐qPCR of Nanog:GFP transcript from Nanog locus with primers complementary
  to 5′UTR of Nanog transcript.G (left) Western blot of pERK in TNERT, TNERTFgfr1−/−,
  TNERTFgfr2−/−, TNERTFgf4−/−, and TNERTFgfbp1−/− with or no OHT. (Right) relative
  pERK levels estimated by densitometry (n = 4).H (top) FACS profiles of TNERT, TNERTFgfr1−/−,
  TNERTFgfr2−/−, TNERTFgf4−/−, TNERTFgfbp1−/− cultured in SL and TNERT + SLPD (n = 3).
  The dotted line represents the FACS profile of unstained E14Tg2a cells used as negative
  control (−ve c). (Bottom) Nanog:GFP population median of indicated cell lines.Data
  information: n ≥ 3 biological replicates (each dot represents a biological replicate).
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM in A, F, G, and H. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  and ns = not significant (paired two‐tailed Student''s t‐test). Source data are
  available online for this figure.'
