figure_title: FLT3-ITD inhibition and ablation of identified coessential genes synergistically
  inhibit purine biosynthesis
caption: '(A) PCA of metabolomics datasets of all combination and single groups over
  replicates. (B) Top enriched metabolic pathways as predicted by Mummichog analysis
  and GSEA analysis. The size of the circle is correlated with the amounts of metabolites
  being identified in the pathway. Three combined treatments share purine biosynthesis
  pathways. (C) Normalized abundances of selected basic and acidic metabolites across
  different treatment groups. The normalization is performed by multiplying compound
  ion abundance with scalar factor calculated with a median and mean deviation approach
  based on all the detected abundance. *P < 0.05. AIR, aminoimidazole ribotide; SAICAR,
  phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide; D3P, d-glycerol 3-phosphate; 2PG,
  2-phosphoglycerate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate. (D) Six NT (nucleosides: A/T/C/G/U/I)
  cocktail but not four NT (nucleotides: T/C/U/I) cocktail protected shCDK9-, shDHODH-,
  or shPRMT5-stable MOLM-13 cells from gilteritinib-induced cell growth defects and
  apoptosis (measured by annexin V/PI staining) at 120 hours. *P < 0.05 and **P <
  0.01. Values are expressed as means ± SEM from triplicates.'
