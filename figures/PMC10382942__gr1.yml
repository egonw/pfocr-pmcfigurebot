caption: 'Transcript aggregation within a reaction and across reaction network(A)
  A first principal component (PC1) drawn within a space representing a reaction to
  which three proteins are annotated. Axes represent three transcript abundance levels
  corresponding to the reaction’s three proteins. Circles represent individual tissue
  samples. Circle color represents sample tissue type. Circle size is varied to suggest
  image depth.(B) Reactions composed as three information sets: proteins (light green
  boxes), other reaction components (orange boxes), and reaction mechanics (purple
  boxes). Protein sets are shown to be connected to a pathway hierarchy (dark green
  boxes) by curved connectors. Reaction mechanics are shown to be connected to each
  other by arrows.'
