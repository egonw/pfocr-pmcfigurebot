caption: Comparison of uninjured and injured SCI microglia to uninjured, injured, and
  diseased brain microglia. A GO pathway enrichment in uninjured spinal cord and brain
  microglia [] using significantly DE genes, represented as a dot plot (See Additional
  file  for additional enrichments). The x axis is the percentage of genes represented
  in the pathway which overlapped with enriched genes. B Venn diagram of genes significantly
  upregulated in the subacute and chronic phases of SCI versus Injury Response Microglia
  (IRM []) and Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) [] (See Additional file  for lists
  of up and down regulated genes following SCI.) C Venn diagram of genes significantly
  downregulated in subacute and chronic SCI versus DAM. D Violin plots of select significantly
  altered genes overlapping across injury states in our SCI data

  and B cell heterogeneity and crosstalk following spinal cord injury.
