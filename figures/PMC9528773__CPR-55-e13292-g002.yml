caption: Pygo2 inhibits adipocyte differentiation in the MAT of Il‐10 −/−  mice through
  the Axin2/GSK3β pathwayIl‐10 −/− mice were infected with lentivirus by intravenous
  (IV) injection to induce Pygo2 overexpression (Pygo2 OE) or shRNA to induce Pygo2
  knockdown (Pygo2 KD). Il‐10 −/−  mice were used as the model group, and WT mice
  were used as the control group (8 mice/group). The mice were treated at eight weeks
  of age for 8 weeks (1 × 109 viral particles/mouse/week). The mice were sacrificed,
  the MAT was isolated, and total and nuclear proteins were extracted. Western blot
  analysis of Axin2 and GSK3β in total MAT proteins (A). Western blot analysis of
  GSK3β in the nucleus in MAT (B). Relative intensities of the proteins (C‐D). The
  data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05
