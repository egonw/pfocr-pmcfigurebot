figure_title: Relationship between microbiota composition and associated host variables
  in relation to clinical response
caption: a, Differentially expressed human host genes identified in stool specimens
  of NPs (n = 18) compared to Ps (n = 8) at 10 months. Significance was calculated
  using two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test. Genes with P < 0.5 and FC > 2 were considered.
  b, Ingenuity pathway analysis of upstream regulators of differentially expressed
  host genes in Ps. Regulators and their targets were plotted using Cytoscape 3.8.0,
  with edges showing connections between regulators and their targets. Newly predicted
  upstream regulators are in yellow, while predicted upstream regulators that were
  included in the identified gene list are in orange. Genes in bold are discussed
  in the text. c, GSEA of predicted cell types based on host genes identified in a
  and differentially expressed in NPs compared to Ps. Significantly enriched (P <
  0.05) cell types are depicted by red dots. d, Transkingdom network analysis. Data
  for microbial taxa (circles), microbial genes (diamonds) and human genes (squares)
  were analyzed to identify highly differentially abundant elements between Ps and
  NPs and integrated with phenotypes (brown hexagons denote clinical outcome (PFS)
  and baseline variables (NLR)) to form a transkingdom network. Favorable (blue) and
  unfavorable (red) nodes (taxa, microbial genes and host genes) were defined as in  and
  in . Blue and orange edges indicate negative and positive correlations, respectively.
  e, Number of edges between phenotypes and each type of omics data (taxa, microbial
  genes and human genes) in the transkingdom (solid red line) and randomized networks
  (the light gray violin plot shows the distribution in 103 random networks, and the
  dashed black line indicates the average). Connectivity strength is the number of
  observed edges between two groups of nodes in the transkingdom network normalized
  by the number of all possible edges in a bipartite graph of the two groups of nodes.
  Two-tailed P values were calculated by one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test. f,g,
  LKT–phenotype Bi-BC (global property; f) and degree (local property; g) of nodes
  in the transkingdom network from d were calculated. Two-tailed P values were calculated
  by Mann–Whitney U test. DCs, dendritic cells; mLN, mesenteric lymph node; NK, natural
  killer.
