caption: 'Inhibiting the expression of miR-383-5p reversed the effects of interfering
  with MALAT1 gene expression on GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis.
  (A, B) The level of miR-383-5p was measured by qRT-PCR; (C) cell proliferation activity
  was measured by the CCK-8 method; (D) cell migration ability was measured by the
  scratch test. The cell migration width was observed under an inverted microscope
  with the original magnification of 50 times; (E) the invasion ability of cells was
  detected by transwell. The number of transmembrane cells stained with crystal violet
  was observed under an inverted microscope, and the original magnification was 100
  times; (F) apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Compared to the control, NC
  inhibitor or si-NC + NC inhibitor group, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001; Compared
  to the si-NC+miR-383-5p inhibitor group, ###P<0.001. RS, resveratrol; NC, normal
  control; MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; GC, gastric
  cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit 8; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.'

  induces the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through the MALAT1/miR-383-5p/DDIT4
  signaling pathway.
