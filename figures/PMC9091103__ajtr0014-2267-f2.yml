caption: Knockdown of TTN-AS1 inhibits MCF-7/TAM cells proliferation and invasion,
  promotes cell apoptosis and G0/G1 cell arrest. A. MCF-7/TAM indicated significantly
  higher expression of TTN-AS1 versus MCF-7. B. The siRNA si-TTN-AS1#2 induced the
  lowest expression of TTN-AS1 in MCF-7/TAM, and was selected as the optimal siRNA
  to develop TTN-AS1-deficient cell line. C. MTT assay showed downregulation of TTN-AS1
  led to higher inhibition in MCF-7/TAM. D. TTN-AS1 silencing impaired the invasive
  ability of MCF-7/TAM. E, F. Downregulation of TTN-AS1 accelerated cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis in MCF-7/TAM. All data are represented as mean Â± SD. Each assay was
  performed in triplicate. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
