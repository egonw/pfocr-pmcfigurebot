caption: Next generating sequencing data stratified according to smoking status. (A)
  Box plot to illustrate the differences in BTK and iBTK expression between ever smokers
  and never smokers. Significance testing data is shown in the figure using differential
  gene expression analysis in R. (B) Gene set enrichment and ontology analysis plot
  demonstrating the key biological pathways that were significantly upregulated in
  ever smokers. P value is shown according to the colour chart on the right-hand side.
  (C) KEGG pathway analysis illustrated for Nf-ĸB signalling cascade. Genes highlighted
  in red indicate significantly upregulated genes in never smokers, this includes
  only BAFF. Genes highlighted in green, indicate significantly upregulated genes
  in ever smokers.
