  cytoskeleton
caption: Cell volume measured by DHM of HEK293A cells treated with 0.5 μM (left) and
  2 μM (right) cytochalasin D. Each dot represents a single cell and error bars represent
  mean ± 95% CI. Data pooled from four independent experiments. Mann–Whitney U test.
  **P = 0.0033 (WT 0.5 μM), ***P < 0.001 (Y/T DKO 0.5 μM), ***P = 0.004(LATS1/2 DKO
  0.5 μM), ***P < 0.001 (WT 2 μM), **P = 0.0022 (Y/T DKO 2 μM) and *P = 0.0145 (LATS1/2
  DKO 2 μM).Fold change in cell volume upon treatment with 0.5 μM (left) and 2 μM
  (right) cytochalasin D relative to untreated control. Each dot represents a single
  cell and error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Data pooled from four independent experiments.
  Mann–Whitney U test. P = 0.1197 (WT vs. Y/T DKO) and P > 0.9999 (all other comparisons).Representative
  immunofluorescence images showing Phalloidin‐labelled actin (red) and Hoechst (blue)
  in latrunculin B (LatB) (0.5 μM)‐ or cytochalasin D (CytD) (2 μM)‐treated HEK293A
  cells compared to control across Hippo pathway genome‐edited cells as shown. Scale
  bar = 20 μm.Average change in cell volume obtained by DHM in response to hydrostatic
  pressure with 2 μM cytochalasin D (CytD) treatment in WT, Y/T DKO and LATS1/2 DKO
  cells. Each dot represents a single cell and error bars represent mean ± 95% CI.
  Data pooled from four independent experiments. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐hoc.
  **P = 0.0044 (WT con vs. CytD), *P = 0.0409 (Y/T DKO con vs. CytD), P > 0.9999 (LATS1/2
  DKO con vs. CytD), ***P = 0.0003 (WT con vs. Y/T DKO con), ***P < 0.001 (WT con
  vs. Y/T DKO CytD) and ***P < 0.001 (Y/T DKO CytD vs. LATS1/2 DKO CytD).Fold difference
  in average change in cell volume in response to dynamic hydrostatic pressure from
  (H) normalized against untreated cells. Each dot represents a single cell and error
  bars are 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. **P = 0.0069 (WT vs. Y/T DKO) and **P = 0.0031

  with 0.5 μM latrunculin B (Lat B) treatment in WT, Y/T DKO and LATS1/2 DKO cells.
