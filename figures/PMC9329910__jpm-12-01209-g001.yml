caption: 'Screening of differentially expressed genes and signaling pathway mechanism
  of melanoma in TCGA database: (A) tumor-associated gene expression changes in melanoma
  samples from TCGA database; (B) gene expression of melanoma marker genes in TCGA
  database; (C) top 25 genes with significantly increased or decreased expression
  in melanoma compared with solid tissue normal samples after screening in TCGA database;
  (D) the expression levels of MITF and TRY are specifically elevated in melanoma;
  (E) melanoma signaling pathways in the KEGG database; (F) mutation distribution
  of KYNU in tumors from TCGA database.'
