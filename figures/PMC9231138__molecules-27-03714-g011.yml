caption: The proposed pathways of major signals induced by DS−1 in U−2 OS cells include
  inhibiting the EMT pathway, enhancing cell adhesion by CD44 actin protrusions, inhibiting
  the cell cycle, and inducing cell apoptosis by means of the IL-6-STAT3 signaling
  pathway and CXCL8-PI3K/AKT-FOXO1 signaling pathway.
