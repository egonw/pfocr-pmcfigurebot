caption: 'APN peptide did not restore the APN signaling in DDAH1−/− rats after MCAO/R
  model. (a) Representative 24-hour TTC staining of rat brain sections. The white-colored
  areas represented infarct region in these sections, and red-colored areas represented
  normal region. (b) Statistical analysis of NSS, infarct volume, and its percentage.
  n.s.: P > 0.05 versus without APNp injection, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus without APNp injection,
  #P < 0.001. (c) Representative Western blots of APR1, APPL1, AMPK, and pAMPK around
  infarct area and statistical analysis and quantification. n.s.: P > 0.05 versus
  without APNp injection, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 versus without APNp injection. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. n = 6. APNp: adiponectin peptide; DDAH1: dimethylarginine dimethylamino
  hydrolase 1; MCAO/R: middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion; APR1: adiponectin
  receptor 1; APPL1: adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and
  leucine zipper 1; AMPK: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; pAMPK:
  phosphorylated AMPK.'
