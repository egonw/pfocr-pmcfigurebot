caption: 'Schematic representation of the virulence factors associated with A. baumannii
  virulome. Cellular Envelope Factors (desiccation resistance, in vivo survival, evasion
  of host immune response): LPS—Lipopolysaccharide; CPS—Capsular polysaccharide; Outer
  Membrane Proteins (OMPs) (adherence, invasion, and cytotoxicity): OmpA—Outer membrane
  protein A; CarO—Carbapenem susceptible porin; SS – Secretions Systems (inter- and
  intraspecies competition, adherence, nutrient acquisition, in vivo survival): Sec—Secretory
  pathway; Tat—Twin-arginine system; T2SS—Type II secretion system; T5SS—Type V secretion
  system; T5bSS—Type Vb secretion system; T5cSS—Type Vc secretion system; CDI—Contact-dependant
  inhibition; Ata—Acinetobacter trimeric autotransporter; T6SS—Type VI secretion system;
  Phospholipases (invasion, in vivo survival): PLD—Phospholipase D; PLC—Phospholipase
  C; Twitching and Swarming Motility (in vivo virulence): T4P or TFP—Type IV pili;
  Biofilm Formation (environmental survival, adherence, and intracellular communication):
  Cus pili—Chaperone-usher pili; PNAG—Poly-β-(1-6)-N-acetylglucosamine; BAP or Bap—Biofilm-associated
  protein; eDNA—Extracellular DNA (structures not drawn to scale; adapted from Harding
  et al. []).Two T5SS have been identified amongst Acinetobacter spp., namely, Type
  Vb (T5bSS) and Type Vc (T5cSS). The T5bSS are classified as two-partner secretion
  (TPS) systems and have been found to be associated with increased adherence to human
  epithelial alveolar (A549) cells, and in vivo virulence in nematodes (Caenorhabditis
  elegans) and murine (BALB/c mice) models []. Another T5bSS, the contact-dependent
  growth inhibition (CDI) system or CdiA/CdiB system, facilitates bacterial competition
  through the secretion of the CdiA toxin into the cytoplasm of neighbouring bacteria
  [] (). Apart from T5bSS, the T5cSS, the Acinetobacter trimeric autotransporter (Ata)
  type Vc secretion system, has been described as multifactorial, facilitating biofilm
  formation, extracellular matrix/basal membrane protein (collagen IV cell) adhesion,
  as well as pathogenesis in murine (C57BL/6 mice) models (). The Type VI secretion
  system (T6SS) is primarily associated with bacterial competition (secretions of
  peptidoglycan hydrolyses and nucleases) and has also been observed to contribute
  to in vivo virulence in a larva [Galleria mellonella (G. mellonella)] model [,].
  This secretion system further facilitates virulence through the release of phospholipases
  of which phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) have been detected and
  described for A. baumannii strains. Three PLDs (PLD1, PLD2, and PLD3) have then
  been found to mediate human serum resistance (higher propensity to cause bacteraemia),
  invasion of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), and pathogenicity in murine
  (C57BL/6 mice) models and larva (G. mellonella) models [] (). For example, the authors
  observed that pld triple mutants (Δpld1-3 triple mutant) exhibited a reduced (74.2
  ± 3.6%) in vivo virulence in comparison to wild-type A. baumannii (89.8 ± 2.6%),
  highlighting the role of phospholipase in the pathogenesis of this opportunistic
  bacterium. Furthermore, PLC has been observed to contribute to human epithelial
  cell (FaDu) cytotoxicity, however, only under nutrient-rich conditions and during
  exposure to chemical stressors such as ethanol [].'
