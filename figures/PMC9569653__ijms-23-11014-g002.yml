caption: 'Analysis of macrophage functions and cell ratios: (A) the heatmap shows
  the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) z-score of the functional activity of M2-like
  TAMs. These functions were classified into four categories according to the different
  gene set characteristics. The green color indicates that the activity of this function
  or pathway is upregulated in TAMs, and the purple color indicates that the activity
  of this function or pathway is downregulated in TAMs. The asterisk indicates that
  one function is significantly upregulated in dMMR or pMMR; (B) the lollipop plot
  shows the infiltration of 10 clusters of macrophages in dMMR and pMMR. Solid circles
  indicate that this cluster of macrophages is significantly enriched in dMMR or pMMR
  (chi-square test, p < 0.05), and hollow circles indicate no significant difference
  in cell ratios between dMMR and pMMR (p > 0.05); (C) changes in the cell ratios
  of M2-like TAMs in dMMR and pMMR at different tumor stages (T1, T2, T3, and T4)
  and lymph node stages (N0, N1, and N2), *** p < 0.001, and * p < 0.05.'
