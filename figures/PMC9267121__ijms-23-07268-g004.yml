caption: Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) inhibited the mRNA and phosphorylated JAK1 and STAT3
  expression in the TNFα-treated human chondrocytes. (A) Protein interaction network
  analysis of the common differently expressed genes (DEGs). (B) JAK1 and (C) STAT3
  mRNA expression levels in the human chondrocytes in the normal, TNFα and TNFα +
  10 μM DHC groups. (D) Western blotting analysis and the quantified results of phosphorylated/total
  (p/t) ratio of (E) JAK1 and (F) STST3. (G) Immunofluorescence staining of p-JAK1
  and (H) quantified results. (I) Immunofluorescence staining of p-STAT3 and (J) quantified
  results. Scale bar = 100 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *, p < 0.05; **, p
  < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared to the TNFα group.
