figure_title: FGF2 secreted by MSCs bound to FGFR2 on T-ALL cells and activated PI3K
  signalling pathway
caption: A RNA-seq cluster diagram of primary murine MSCs isolated from leukaemia
  and control mice (Red colour meant the genes were up-regulated and green colour
  meant the genes were down-regulated). B Heat map of primary murine T-ALL cells co-cultured
  with MSCs from leukaemia or control mice for 16 h (red colour meant the genes were
  up-regulated and green colour meant the genes were down-regulated). C Schematic
  representation of analysis strategies integrating expression profiles obtained from
  two RNA-seqs. D Realtime PCR was used to validate the expression pattern of selected
  six cytokine genes in MSCs and found that FGF2 was significantly up-regulated in
  MSCs from leukaemia mice. E Quantitative analysis of four FGF receptors showed that
  FGFR2 was significantly up-regulated in murine T-ALL cells cultured with leukaemia
  derived MSCs. F Dose response curve of BGJ398 with different concentration revealed
  that IC50 was 1 μM. G The knockdown efficiency of FGF2 in MSCs after sh-RNA transfection.
  H The phosphorylation of key proteins of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in T-ALL
  cells after addition of BGJ398 or FGF2 knockdown were analysed by Western blot.
