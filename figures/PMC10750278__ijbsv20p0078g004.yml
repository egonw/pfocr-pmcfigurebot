caption: The expression of SECTM1 was knocked down and the effect of SECTM1 on GBM
  cell proliferation was detected. shRNA inhibition of SECTM1 mRNA and protein expression
  in U87 MG (A-C) and U251 MG (E-G) were detected by RT-qPCR or western blotting,
  and the gray value statistics were obtained. CCK-8 was used to detect the effect
  of SECTM1 knockdown on the proliferation of U87 MG (D) and U251 MG (H). Image and
  statistical analysis of the effect of SECTM1 knockdown on U87 MG (I-K) and U251
  MG (L-N) cell cycle by flow cytometry. All data were analyzed by T-test for P-values
  as the mean ±SEM of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; ** P <0.01; *** P
  < 0.001.
article_title: SECTM1 promotes the development of glioblastoma and mesenchymal transition
  by regulating the TGFβ1/Smad signaling pathway.
