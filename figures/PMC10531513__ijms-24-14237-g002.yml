caption: 'Expression analysis and functional prediction of differential mRNAs in the
  spleen. (A) Volcano diagrams of mRNA. The abscissa and ordinate represent X = log2
  (fold changes) and Y = −log10 (p-value); the red dots indicate upregulated differential
  genes, the blue dots indicate downregulated differential genes, and the gray dots
  indicate genes with no significant difference. (B) The clustering heatmaps of the
  highest differentially expressed. (C) GO analysis on the function of differential
  genes. Nor: Normal raccoon dog, Dis: Diseased raccoon dog. (D) KEGG analysis of
  the top 20 signaling pathways enriched with differential genes. (E) Construction
  of MAPK signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway and
  related genes interactions network to find the key genes, and the results revealed
  that ERLIN1 was found to be involved in all three signaling pathways simultaneously.'
