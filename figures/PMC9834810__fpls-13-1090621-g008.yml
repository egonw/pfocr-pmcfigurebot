caption: 'Model for the role of a TRIM-like sequence insertion in the MdFLS2-1 promoter
  region in regulating resistance of apple to Alternaria blotch disease. MdFLS2 allele
  is involved in the resistance of apple to Alternaria blotch disease via increasing
  the expression level of genes related to salicylic acid pathway (NPR1, TGA3, and
  PR1). Insertion of a TRIM-like sequence into the MdFLS2-1 promoter region enhances
  MdFLS2-1 expression to improve resistance of apple to Alternaria blotch disease.
  Arrow: activation; Bar: repression.'
article_title: Insertion of a TRIM-like sequence in MdFLS2-1 promoter is associated
  with its allele-specific expression in response to Alternaria alternata in apple.
