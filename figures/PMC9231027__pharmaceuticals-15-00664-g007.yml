caption: Dihydroconiferyl ferulate inhibits the c-Myc pathway via Stat3/nEGFR. (A,B)
  The relative mRNA levels of c-Myc were measured in mammospheres after treatment
  with dihydroconiferyl ferulate (50 µM) for 48 h. Dihydroconiferyl ferulate reduces
  the mRNA levels of c-Myc. (C) The expression level of c-Myc in total protein from
  MDA-MB-231 mammospheres treated with dihydroconiferyl ferulate (50 µM) for 48 h.
  Dihydroconiferyl ferulate reduces the expression of c-Myc. (D) The nuclear protein
  level of c-Myc was determined in mammospheres derived from MDA-MB-231 cells treated
  with dihydroconiferyl ferulate (50 µM) for 48 h. Dihydroconiferyl ferulate decreases
  the level of c-Myc in mammospheres. (E) The protein levels of Stat3 and c-Myc in
  MDA-MB-231 cells treated with a specific Stat3 siRNA. Knockdown of Stat3 decreased
  the expression of c-Myc. (F) qRT-PCR analysis of c-Myc in MDA-MB-231 cells treated
  with a specific Stat3 siRNA. (G) The protein levels of Stat3 and c-Myc in MDA-MB-231
  cells treated with a specific c-Myc siRNA. Knockdown of c-Myc does not affect the
  expression of Stat3. Knockdown of c-Myc inhibits mammosphere formation. Representative
  data were collected and the data represent the mean ± standard deviation; ** p <
  0.01 vs. control.
