figure_title: Schematic diagram of miR-275/305 cluster role in modulating dietary
  yeast-dependent metabolic homeostasis
caption: Our proposed model summarizes the mechanism by which miR-275/305 targets
  SLC2A1/GLIS2 to regulate energy metabolic homeostasis. In the presence of dietary
  yeast, the activation of the insulin signaling pathway is followed by the activation
  of the miR-275/305 cluster expression, which in turn inhibits SLC2A1/GLIS2 transcription
  via binding their 3â€™UTR region. Meanwhile, TOR can directly act on target genes
  without affecting miRNAs. This cascade regulation finally ensures normal metabolic
  physiology. Dietary yeast may contribute to the activation of the miR-275/305 cluster
  through an unknown pathway (indicated by dashed lines and question marks). Under
  yeast deprivation conditions, either the activity of insulin or the TOR signaling
  pathway was low, and the expression of SLC2A1/GLIS2 was derepressed, thus ensuring
  the basal metabolism needed. Arrows and T-shaped symbols represent activation and
  inhibition, respectively. Dashed arrows denote the unknown pathway, the components
  that are less active or inactive are shown in grey, while red crosses indicate shut-down
  pathways.
