figure_title: IKZF1/IKAROS and MTA2 exhibit synthetic lethal interaction with pharmacologic
  inhibition of MENIN and DOT1L
caption: 'a, Functional genetic screen schematic: cells treated with EPZ-5676 (1 μM),
  VTP-50469 (500 nM) or vehicle. b, Drug targeting of MENIN (VTP-50469) and DOT1L
  (EPZ-5676) disrupts MLL-fusion complex function. c, Volcano plot depicting Wald
  p-value and beta value calculated using MAGeCK MLE for the VTP-50469 and EPZ-5676
  combined analysis comparing vehicle-treated (n=2) and drug-treated states (n=4)
  on Day 14. d, MAGeCKFlute 9-square correlation plot using the beta value calculated
  between Day 0 and Day 14 for vehicle-treatment as compared to drug treatment (VTP-50469
  and EPZ-5676 screens combined). Regions corresponding to pathway (group1), resistance
  (group2) and synthetic lethal (group4) genetic hits are indicated. e, Leading edge
  analysis from GSEA showing overlapping genetic hits for each screen considered separately.
  f, CRISPR/Cas9-based competition assays targeting either IKZF1 or MTA2 monitoring
  sgRNA-RFP expression over time in Cas9-expressing MOLM13 AML cell line +/− VTP-50469.
  g, Proliferation assay on sorted, sgRNA-RFP-expressing cells +/− VTP-50469 or EPZ-5676.
  Data represent mean+/−SEM (n=3) with p-value calculated using paired, two-tail t-test.
  h, Cell morphology assessed using light microscopy (100X) 7 days following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
  deletion of IKZF1 or MTA2, compared to non-targeting sgRNA control i, Colony forming
  assay comparing MOLM13 cells with sgRNA targeting Luciferase (Non-Targeting) control
  versus two different sgRNAs targeting IKZF1 (n =4 per sgRNA). Data represent mean
  +/− SEM. p-value determined by unpaired, two-tailed t-test. j, Proliferation assay
  comparing MOLM13 cells with sgRNA targeting Luciferase (NT control) and two sgRNAs
  targeting IKZF1 (n=3 per sgRNA) upon treatment with VTP-50469 for 5 days. Data represent
  mean +/− SEM. k, Schematic for in vivo, MOLM13 xenograft experiment: 200,000 MOLM13
  cells with sgRNA targeting Luciferase (NT control) versus two different sgRNAs targeting
  IKZF1 (n = 5 per group) were injected via tail vein at Day 0, treatment began with
  VTP-50469 chow at Day 9, and mice were sacrificed at Day 18 when they became ill.
  l, MOLM13 xenograft experiment, burden of disease and differentiation markers in
  spleen and bone marrow after 9 days of VTP-50469 treatment. Data represent mean
  +/− SEM. p-value determined by unpaired, two-tailed t-test.'
