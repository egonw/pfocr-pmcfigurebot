caption: BPA exposure enhances redox signaling during embryonic development. The ROS
  levels were measured at the time of BPA removal (after exposure for 12 h) (A) and
  at the statistical analysis endpoint (72 h) (B). n = 3/treatment. (C) The representative
  genes involved in the redox signaling pathway were determined at the time of BPA
  removal (12 h). Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences
  among groups (a > b > c > d, p < 0.05). n = 3/treatment.
