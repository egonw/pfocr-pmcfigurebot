caption: 'Important KEGG pathway in DKD that may be regulated by persistently dysregulated
  lncRNAs. The size of the dots represents the number of genes, and the color represents
  the range of the pathway q-values. The y-axis represents the KEGG pathway, and the
  x-axis shows the five lncRNAs involved in each selected pathway. Q-value: p value
  adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg method.'
