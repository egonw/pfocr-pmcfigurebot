caption: 'A. muciniphila inhibits CRC development via AhR. (A) Top 30 metabolite analysis
  of the gut microbiome of mice in the combination A. muciniphila group vs. the Vehicle
  group by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. * 0.01 < P
  ≤ 0.05, ** 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01, *** P ≤ 0.001, Two-sided Hypotheses. (B) GO terms and
  KEGG pathways. PLS-DA plots of metabolite based on the Bray-Curtis distance. (C)
  RNA sequencing analysis of DEGs in the tumor tissues derived from the mice model
  described in Figure D (n = 3). Volcano plot: p-values are plotted against the log2
  of the change in corresponding RNA expression level of AhR in A. muciniphila-infected
  pseudo-GF/AOM/DSS group versus that in pseudo-GF/AOM/DSS group. Dashed vertical
  lines indicate cut-offs for differential expression. Dashed horizontal lines indicate
  the cut-off for adjusted p-value <0.05 determined with DESeq2. (D) Unsupervised
  cluster analysis. (E) Two CRISPR nuclease sgRNA designed for AhR. A schematic illustrates
  the first three and the last intron-exon organization of the AhR gene. AhR KO cells
  were produced by CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations resulting in a frameshift and premature
  stop codon. The locations of sgRNA target sequences and the alignment of amino acid
  sequences, showing changes introducing a premature stop codon, are noted. (F) Western
  blot analysis of AhR expression. In DLD-1 and NCM460 cells, proteins were collected
  from AhR knockout cells (AhR -/-), AhR sh-RNA cells and Control cells (CN). (G)
  DLD-1/AhR -/- cells and NCM460/AhR -/- cells were cultured in vitro through sphere-formation
  assay. Left panels are representative phase contrast photos (scale bar, 50mm). Data
  in right panels represent the average of sphere numbers from three independent experiments.
  (H) The number and size of one-generation spheres were quantified at 3 days after
  plating by counting viable spheres per well. Data from triplicate experiments are
  presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, t test.'
