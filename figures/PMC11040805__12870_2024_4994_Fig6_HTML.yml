caption: Differentially expressed antioxidant-related genes analysis. (A) Gene ontology
  (GO) classification of differentially expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) genes.
  The horizontal coordinate is GO classification, the left side of the vertical coordinate
  is the percentage of the number of genes, and the right side is the number of genes.
  (B) Gene ontology of ROS genes. The horizontal coordinate is the proportion of the
  genes weâ€™re interested and all the differentially expressed genes, while the vertical
  coordinate is each GO annotation entry. The size of the dots represents the number
  of differentially expressed genes annotated in the pathway, and the color of the
  dots represents the q-value of the hypergeometric test. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification of differentially expressed antioxidant-related
  genes. The horizontal coordinate is the number of genes annotated to this pathway
  and its proportion to the total number of genes annotated. (D) Cluster heat maps
  of antioxidant-related genes 0 d and 5 d after Xcc infection. Red and blue colour
  indicate up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. The same below
