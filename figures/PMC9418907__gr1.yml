caption: Effects of TCDD on the expression of AhR target genes.A, the presence of
  putative dioxin response elements (pDREs) and AhR genomic binding 2 h after a single
  bolus dose of 30 μg/kg TCDD. B, hepatic expression of AhR target genes assessed
  in a time course study. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were administered a single bolus
  dose of 30 μg/kg TCDD. Liver samples were collected at the corresponding time point.
  Color scale represents the log2(fold change) for differential gene expression determined
  by RNA-Seq analysis. Counts represent the maximum number of raw aligned reads for
  any treatment group. Low counts (<500 reads) are denoted in yellow with high counts
  (>10,000) in pink. C, dose-dependent gene expression was assessed in mice (n = 3)
  following oral gavage with sesame oil vehicle or TCDD. Differential expression with
  a posterior probability (P1(t)) > 0.80 is indicated with a black triangle in the
  upper right tile corner. TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor.
