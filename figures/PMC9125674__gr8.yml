caption: 'Effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10 μM) treatment on protein synthesis
  rate, phosphorylation of mTOR and protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K), and the protein
  levels of atrogin-1 and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) in myoblasts from chicken embryo
  pectoralis major (PM) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Myoblasts from PM: (A) nitrite
  (NO2−) concentrations; (B) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and total nitric
  oxide synthase (TNOS) activities; (C) cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level;
  (D) protein synthesis rate; (E) total and phosphorylated mTOR; (F) total and phosphorylated
  p70S6K; (G) atrogin-1; (H) MuRF1. Myoblasts from BF: (I) NO2− concentrations; (J)
  iNOS and TNOS activities; (K) cGMP level; (L) protein synthesis rate; (M) total
  and phosphorylated mTOR; (N) total and phosphorylated p70S6K; (O) atrogin-1; (P)
  MuRF1. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6); ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
