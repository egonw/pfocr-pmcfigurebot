caption: 'RPPA protein profiling of OvCa PDM identifies significant differences in
  active protein signaling pathways as molecular basis for OvCa PDM drug treatment
  responses. (A) Protein heat map covering 116 analytes analyzed in OvCa PDM (n =
  7) and BC PDM (n = 1) generated from sample sizes of n = 100–150 PDM. Protein abundances
  for each analyte are displayed as median-centered, log2-transformed NFI signals.
  Samples were subjected to hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance (complete
  linkage). (B) Activation state of different pathways in the different OvCa PDM models.
  Proteins related to an “active” pathway were selected for each of the plotted pathways
  (see ). Protein signals are shown as median-centered, log2 transformed NFI signals.
  Dotted lines indicate log2 values of +0.6 (fold change of +1.5) and −1 log2 (fold
  change of −0.5). Data are shown as box and whiskers plots with minimum and maximum
  range. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post
  hoc test. (C) Cytotoxicity measurement of OvCa PDM treated with standard platinum-based
  chemotherapy (carbo 75–125 µM) and/or targeted therapy (selum 100–200 nM, palbo
  100–200 nM, sara 1–2 µM). Four replicates per treatment with n = 15 PDM per well
  were performed and measured after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Signals were measured as
  RFU (Relative Fluorescent Unit), background corrected and normalized to vehicle
  control (DMSO). In case of palbociclib to H2O control. Data are shown as mean values.
  Statistical significances compared to vehicle control or H2O are shown. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.
  Carbo: carboplatin; Selum: selumetinib; Palbo: palbociclib; Sara: saracatenib.'
