caption: SIRT4 increases the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drug Sorafenib.
  A Colony formation of primary HCC cells expressing shCtrl or SIRT4 in the absence
  or presence of Sorafenib. B Growth curves of primary HCC cells expressing shCtrl
  or SIRT4 treated with or without Sorafenib. C Experimental design using HCC PDXs,
  where mice were injected with human HCC cells with SIRT4 low expression (LE) or
  high expression (HE). D, E Tumour volume curves and images at the end the point.
  F, G IHC analysis and quantification of Ki67-positive cells of PDX described in
  C. n = 5 mice per group. Group differences were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (A, B, D, G) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
article_title: mTORC1-c-Myc pathway rewires methionine metabolism for HCC progression
  through suppressing SIRT4 mediated ADP ribosylation of MAT2A.
