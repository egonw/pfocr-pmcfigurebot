caption: Squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) leaves showing mosaic-like symptoms, chlorosis,
  vein banding, and leaf malformation following a systemic infection by Cucumber mosaic
  virus (CMV) at 12 dpi (A). Single local lesions develop in CMV-inoculated Chenopodium
  amaranticolor leaves at 4–5 dpi (B). RT-PCR with primers specific for the CMV-CP
  gene detected an amplicon of 600 bp (M, 100bp ladder, 1, negative control, 2, CMV-infected
  squash, 3, and 4, C. amaranticolor local lesions induced by CMV) (C). Transmission
  electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the purified CMV particles are spherical
  and approximately 30 nm in size (D).
