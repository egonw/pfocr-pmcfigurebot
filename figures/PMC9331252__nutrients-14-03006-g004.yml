caption: 'MLE and nCGA reduced the expression of proliferation-related proteins in
  diabetic cultured VSMCs. (A) The levels of PI3K, p-Akt, and PCNA in OH-treated A7r5
  cells were notably increased under OH conditions and notably decreased after treatment
  with nCGA (40 and 120 μM). (B) In OH-stimulated A7r5 cells, the levels of Ras and
  p-ERK were increased, and OH-induced upregulation was nullified by nCGA. The quantitative
  data are presented as the mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent experiments.
  # p < 0.05 as compared to the C (control). * p < 0.05 as compared to the OH group.'
