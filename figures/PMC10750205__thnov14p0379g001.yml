caption: Known mechanisms how endosialin promotes tumor cell proliferation, adhesion
  and migration. Endosialin expressed in CAFs binds with Mac-2BP/90K expressed in
  tumor cells to promote tumor cell adhesion and migration. Tumor cell expressed endosialin
  could bind with ECM proteins like FN, Col I and Col IV to enhance cell adhesion
  and migration, or promote the interaction between ITGB1 and ECM proteins, activate
  the FAK-paxillin pathway, and promote the formation of focal adhesion and metastasis.
