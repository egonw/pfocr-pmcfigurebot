caption: The effects of AMG232 with Doxorubicin in, activation of the p53-p21 signaling
  pathway. The results revealed that combinational treatment could induce an increased
  expression of p53 and MDM-2 in NALM-6 cells. Values of three independent experiments
  are given as mean±SD. β-Actin was used as an internal control.
