caption: 'ODN2088 inhibited PANoptosis in SAE rats. At 24 h after CLP, (A) caspase-3,
  Bcl-2, (B) NLRP3, caspase-1, (C) RIPK1, RIPK3, p-MLKL in different groups are shown,
  with GAPDH used as the loading control. n = 5. Data are represented by histograms,
  and the sham group is normalized. ∗P < 0.05. All experiments were repeated three
  times and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation. CLP: Cecal ligation and perforation;
  MLKL: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein; NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3; PANoptosis: Pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis; RIPK: Receptor-interacting
  protein kinase; SAE: Sepsis associated encephalopathy.'

  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in a neonatal rat model with
  sepsis associated encephalopathy.
