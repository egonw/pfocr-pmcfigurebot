caption: 'Mechanistic insights into the dual role of intratumoral microbiota in cancer.
  Intratumoral microbiota play a dual role in the TME. On the one hand, intra-tumoral
  bacteria contribute to tumorigenesis, progression, drug resistance, and metastasis
  by releasing genotoxins, promoting the WNT/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, inducing
  host complement C3, fostering cancer cell autophagy, and secreting metalloproteinases.
  On the other hand, these intra-tumoral bacteria facilitate anti-tumor immunity through
  mechanisms involving immune cell recruitment, activation of CD8+ T cells, induction
  of chemotactic factors, and stimulation of anti-tumor immune responses via bacterial
  antigen elicitation. TME: Tumor microenvironment; DC: Dendritic cell; STING: Stimulator
  of interferon genes.'
