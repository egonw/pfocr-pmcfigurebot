caption: 'SLC22A10 and SLC22A15 induce ROR1 activation and EMT via IFN/STAT3 signaling
  pathway(A) Volcano plots demonstrating global transcriptional changes in SLC22A10-
  and SLC22A15-OE clones versus vector-transduced clone as determined by RNA-seq analysis.
  Each circular dot indicates one gene. X axis: log2 fold change; Y axis: logP-values.
  Highlighted genes inside rectangles are the most significantly differentially expressed
  genes in cells expressing SLC22A10 (left) and SLC22A15 (right).(B) Venn diagram
  showing the most significantly differentially expressed genes common to both SLC22A10-
  and SLC22A15-OE clones as unveiled by RNA-seq analysis.(C) mRNA levels of top genes
  most significantly differentially expressed in both SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE clones
  compared with the control clone. For the data presented in (A-C), n = 3 independent
  biological replicates of each sample were used for the RNA-seq.(D) Western blots
  showing protein expression of pROR1 (Tyr786), and ROR1 in control, SLC22A10-OE,
  and SLC22A15-OE clones in PANC-1 and HPAF-II cells. β-Actin was used as a loading
  control. Western blots shown represent three independent experiments.(E) Representative
  phase contrast images of PANC-1 cells captured 72 h post-transduction with lentiviral
  particles of vector or pHAGE-ROR1. Scale bars, 50 μm n = 3 random fields photographed
  and analyzed from each condition.(F) Western blots showing the protein expression
  of total and phosphorylated ROR1 and epithelial and mesenchymal markers in PANC-1
  cells transduced with lentiviral particles of vector or pHAGE-ROR1. β-Actin was
  used as a loading control. Results represent three independent experiments.(G) Western
  blots assessing the protein expression of SLC22A10, SLC22A15, pROR1 (Tyr786), ROR1,
  and epithelial, and mesenchymal markers in SLC22A10-OE, SLC22A15-OE, shRNA-ROR1,
  SLC22A10-OE + shROR1, and SLC22A15-OE + shROR1 transduced clones. β-Actin was used
  as a loading control. Results represent at least three independent experiments performed.(H)
  GSEA enrichment plot displaying the enrichment of hallmark IFN-α and IFN-γ pathway
  genes in SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE clones. NES: enrichment score normalized to mean
  enrichment of random samples of the same size. n = 3 independent biological replicates
  of each RNA sample (pLV-Control, pLV-SLC22A10, and pLV-SLC22A15) were sequenced
  and analyzed.(I) Western blots assessing the protein expression of key players of
  the IFN-α and IFN-γ signaling pathway in vector-transduced and SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE
  clones. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data represent three independent
  experiments.(J) Quantification of IFN-α and IFN-γ in the conditioned medium (CM)
  collected from vector-control, SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE clones. Error bars: mean ±
  SD.(K) Western blots displaying the protein expression of key players of the IFN-α
  and IFN-γ signaling pathway including pROR1 (Tyr786), and ROR1 in stable clones
  of shRNA-Control (scramble), shSLC22A10, and shSLC22A15 developed in Mes and mKPC
  cells. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Western blots shown represent three
  independent experiments.(L) Western blots depicting the protein expression of markers
  of the IFN-STAT3-ROR1 signaling axis in PANC-1 cells treated with the indicated
  concentrations of IFN-α and IFN-γ for 48 h β-Actin was used as a loading control.
  Western blots shown represent three independent experiments.(M) Western blots assessing
  the protein expression of pSTAT3 (Tyr705), STAT3, pROR1 (Tyr786), and ROR1 in vector-transduced
  and SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE clones treated with WP1066 (2.5 μM) for 24 h β-Actin
  was used as a loading control. Western blots shown represent at least three independent
  experiments.(N) Western blots assessing the protein expression of IFNAR1, IFNGR1,
  pROR1 (Tyr786), and ROR1 in vector-transduced and SLC22A10- and SLC22A15-OE clones
  treated with IFN-α-IFNα-R-I (10 μM) for 24 h β-Actin was used a loading control.
  Western blots shown represent three independent experiments.Data in (J) were analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ns, not significant. Results represent three independent experiments.'
