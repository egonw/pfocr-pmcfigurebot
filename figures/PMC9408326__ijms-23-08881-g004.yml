caption: Receptor, enzyme, and transcription factor pathway nodes, small molecules,
  and viruses that regulate ACBD3 transcription. Blue dots represent repression of
  ACBD3 transcripts and red dots represent promotion of ACBD3 transcripts; the cut-off
  was set at a transcription fold change of at least 2 and a confidence interval of
  99.9% or greater. (a) Factors that affect ACBD3 transcription across all normal
  tissues. (b) Factors that affect ACBD3 transcription in normal breast tissue.
