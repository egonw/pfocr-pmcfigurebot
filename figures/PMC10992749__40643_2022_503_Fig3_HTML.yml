caption: Manipulation of fructose metabolic pathway promotes l-ornithine accumulation
  in C. glutamicum SO26. A l-Ornithine production curves of strain C. glutamicum SO26
  (solid black square) and SO30 (with pfkB1 deletion, hollow blue cycle) cultivated
  on glucose. B Cell growth curves of strain C. glutamicum SO26 (solid black square)
  and SO30 (hollow blue cycle) cultivated on glucose. C l-Ornithine concentration
  in the fermentation liquids of strain SO26 (solid black square), SO30 (hollow green
  cycle), SO31 (hollow blue upper triangle), and SO32 (hollow red lower triangle)
  cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. D Cell growth of strain SO26 (solid black square),
  SO30 (hollow green cycle), SO31 (hollow blue upper triangle), and SO32 (hollow red
  lower triangle) cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. Data are averages and standard
  deviations from three independent experiments
