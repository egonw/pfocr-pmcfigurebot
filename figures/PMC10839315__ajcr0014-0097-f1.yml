caption: CTSC overexpression promotes cell growth. A. RT-PCR and western blot analysis
  of CTSC in CTSC overexpression and mock cells. B. Cell proliferation rates by CCK-8
  assay in CTSC overexpression and mock cells. Data are presented as the means ± standard
  deviation and are analyzed using Student’s t-test (n = 5). C. The clonogenic assay
  is performed on a six-well culture plate. Crystal violet-stained cells are dissolved
  in 70% alcohol, and absorbance at 595 nm is measured using a spectrophotometer.
  The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation and are analyzed using Student’s
  t-test (n = 9). D. The anoikis assay is performed on an ultra-low attachment cell-culture
  plate. Single-cell suspensions have grown into large spheroids. Data are presented
  as the means ± standard deviation and are analyzed using Student’s t-test (n = 5).
  Scale bar, 100 μm. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
