caption: Intracellular signaling through Ras/MAP Kinase and Jak/Stat pathways. Genes
  whose mutations have been found in MF are labeled with red bold font. Within this
  model, loss of function in NF1 and CBL; gain of function mutations in PTPN11 (encoding
  SHP2); and activating mutations in K/NRAS, lead to hyperactive Ras signaling [,].
  JAK2 and MPL gain-of-function mutations result in hyperactive Jak/Stat signaling.
  Mutations in CALR, lastly, induce constitutive activation of Mpl and Jak/Stat signaling,
  particularly in myeloproliferative neoplasms []. Various small molecular inhibitors
  against targets in the Ras/MAPK pathway or JAK/Stat pathway are included in text
  boxes in red font [].
