caption: Inhibition of TSG-6 expression by JAK inhibitors. Cells were treated with
  JAK inhibitors (10 µM each of JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor) 20 min prior to cytokine
  treatment or coculture. Cell lysates were recovered 48 h after stimulation, and
  TSG-6 expression was analyzed using immunoblotting. (A) TSG-6 expression in ASCs
  after treatment with TNF-α, IL-1β, and/or IFN-γ + LPS. TSG-6 expression in ASCs
  (B) or macrophages (C) after coculture. The data shown represent one of three independent
  experiments. ** p ≤ 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. Inh., inhibitor.

  Cells during Coculture of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Macrophages via the JAK/STAT
  Signaling Pathway.
