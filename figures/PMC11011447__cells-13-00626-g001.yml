caption: 'Smad4kera-cko revealed corneal thinning phenotype similar to those in Tgfbr2kera-cko.
  (A) Schematic drawing of Smad4 deletion in KerartTA; TetO-Cre; Smad4flox/flox mouse
  line. The rtTA is constitutively synthesized from KerartTA alleles in keratocytes
  but remains in an inactive form. Upon binding of doxycycline (dox) to rtTA, the
  dox-rtTA complex transcriptionally activates Tet-O-Cre and produces Cre recombinase,
  which then subsequently splices loxP sites and flank the exon 8. (Bâ€“G) OCT revealed
  thinner corneas in Smad4kera-cko and Tgfbr2kera-cko compared to those in the control
  group respectively at P42 (n = 6, ****, p < 0.0001). (C,E,H) However, the Central
  Corneal Thickness of Smad4kera-cko corneas showed no significant difference compared
  to those in Tgfbr2kera-cko (n = 6, ns). Abbreviation: ns, not significant.'
