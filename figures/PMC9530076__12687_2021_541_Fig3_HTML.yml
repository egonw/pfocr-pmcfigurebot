caption: 'Costs of standard genetic testing by phenotype/rare disease category. Figure 3
  illustrates the costs of the standard genetic testing pathway by phenotype category.
  The median cost of standard care for each phenotype category (for groups with n > 2)
  is shown by the horizontal line within each box. The outer whisker lines indicate
  the minimum and maximum costs for each phenotype category, excluding outliers. Outliers
  are shown as ‘dots’ and represent the observations with unusually high or low test
  costs in comparison to the median for that phenotype. Outliers were generally patients
  with large numbers of single gene tests and an expensive gene panel test. Note:
