caption: '(A) Heatmaps showing the steady-state abundances of metabolites from U2932
  BCR-DLBCL cells grown either in suspension or in Matrigel ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099
  for 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. (B) Relative steady-state abundances of glutamine and
  glutamate from U2932 BCR-DLBCL cells grown either in suspension or in Matrigel ±
  the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 24 hours. Metabolite abundance is the mean of n =
  3 independent biological experiments, ± SD. (C) Relative steady-state abundances
  of citrate, isocitrate, α-KG, succinate, fumarate, and malate from U2932 BCR-DLBCL
  cells grown either in suspension or in Matrigel ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for
  24 hours. Metabolite abundance is the mean of n = 3 independent biological experiments,
  ± SD. (D) Quantification of the isotopologue abundances of M + 4 citrate and M +
  4 malate in Pfeiffer DLBCL cells cultured in suspension and in Matrigel with l-[U-13C]-glutamine
  ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 2 hours. Isotopologue abundance is the mean of n
  = 3 independent biological experiments, ± SD. (E) Growth assay of Pfeiffer and U2932
  cell lines cultured in suspension ± the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 for 5 days in 5% oxygen
  hypoxia chamber. Cell concentration is the mean of n = 3 independent biological
  experiments, ± SD. Vehicle: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). ns, P > 0.05; *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed
  by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.'
