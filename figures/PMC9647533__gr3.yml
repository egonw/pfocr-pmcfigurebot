caption: miR-16 promotes enterocyte viability, maintains tight junction integrity,
  and inhibits apoptosis and cytokine production by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling
  pathway.A, interaction of 161 genes analyzed by STRING and visualized by Cytoscape
  3.5.1. Blue node indicates a high degree while orange a low degree. A thick link
  between the nodes indicates a close coexpression relation while a thin link indicates
  a far relation. B, Venn diagram of the miR-16 target gene and IBS target genes.
  C, plot of KEGG enrichment. The abscissa represents the number of genes involved
  in the pathway and the ordinate represents the name of the pathway. The color of
  the dots indicates −log10 p-value. D, the binding site of miR-16 with TLR4 in mouse
  and human predicted by microRNA.org. E, the binding of miR-16 to TLR4 in HEK293T
  cells verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. F, Western blot detection of TLR4,
  NF-κB, and p65p-NF-κB p65 levels in the colorectal tissue of control and IBS-D mice;
  G, qRT-PCR determination of miR-16 expression in LPS-induced NCM460 cells treated
  with miR-16 mimic or inhibitor; H, Western blot detection of TLR4, NF-κB p65, and
  p-NF-κB p65 expression in LPS-induced NCM460 cells treated with miR-16 mimic or
  inhibitor. I, qRT-PCR for determination of miR-16 in LPS-induced NCM460 cells treated
  with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242. J, Western blot detection
  of TLR4, NF-κB p65, and p-NF-κB p65 expression in LPS-induced NCM460 cells treated
  with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242. K, CCK-8 assay of LPS-induced
  NCM460 cell viability following treatment with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with
  oe-TLR4/TAK-242. L, flow cytometry of LPS-induced NCM460 cell apoptosis following
  treatment with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242. M, ELISA and
  qRT-PCR for detection of IL-1β and IL-6 levels in the culture medium of LPS-induced
  NCM460 cells treated with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242. N,
  Western blot detection of expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin
  in LPS-induced NCM460 cells treated with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242.
  O, TER was determined to reflect the tight junction integrity in the LPS-induced
  NCM460 cells treated with miR-16 mimic alone or combined with oe-TLR4/TAK-242. ∗p <
  0.05. Measurement data were expressed as mean ± SD. Comparison of data among multiple
  groups was performed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Statistical
  analysis concerning time-based measurements within each group was realized using
  repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test. All cell experiments were
  conducted independently in triplicate. IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IBS-D, IBS
  with diarrhea; CCK-8, cell-counting kit-8; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; qRT-PCR, quantitative
  RT-PCR; TER, transepithelial resistance.
