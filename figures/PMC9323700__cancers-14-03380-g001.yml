caption: Cell cycle and a simplified illustration of interactions with selected kinases
  and cyclins. G1 is the cell cycle phase; in this phase, the cell increases in volume,
  but mitosis has not yet taken place. It is the first part of the interphase and
  transition into the S phase, the cell cycle’s replication phase. DNA replication
  takes place in this phase. The S phase (2nd phase) is usually constant in time (about
  7 to 8 h) and lies between the G1 and G2 phases. Third, the G2 phase of the cell
  cycle is the second part of the interphase. It follows the S phase and enters the
  prophase of mitosis, in which the cell’s chromatin condenses into chromosomes. The
  following M phase describes the division of the cell. The nucleus splits (mitosis),
  and the entire cell divides (cytokinesis). Finally, the facultative G0 phase is
  the cell-cycle stage in which dormant or differentiated cells (e.g., nerve and muscle
  cells) are found [].
