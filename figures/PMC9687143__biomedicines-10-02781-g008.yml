caption: ARS staining in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors. hDPSCs were spread on
  non-TCPP plates coated with 1 M RGD-3 or dH2O (control) and were then exposed to
  20 Î¼M of one of three MAPK pathway inhibitors (SP600125 for JNK, SB202190 for p38
  and PD98059 for ERK) on day 6 in serum-free DMEM for 2 h. Then, the medium was changed,
  and culture was continued. (A) Photographs of mineral nodules formed after 30 days
  of culture. (B) CPC quantification of mineralized product staining intensity in
  (A). p38 inhibitor neutralizes the effect of RGD-3 on hDPSC mineralization. n =
  3, different lowercase characters denote significant differences compared to the
  control (p < 0.05 vs. control).
