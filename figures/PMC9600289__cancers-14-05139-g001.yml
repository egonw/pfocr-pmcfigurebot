caption: Methyltransferases participate in ESCA progression in an m6A-dependent way.
  (A) Ref. [] METTL3 upregulated GLS2 expression through increasing m6A modification
  level of GLS2 and promoted migration and invasion of ESCC cells; (B) Ref. [] METTL3
  upregulated NOTCH1 expression through increasing m6A modification level of NOTCH1,
  activated Notch signaling pathway and thus promoted proliferation, migration and
  invasion of ESCC cells; (C) Ref. [] Depletion of METTL3 significantly reduced m6A
  modification levels of ESCC cells. METTL3 promoted proliferation of ESCC cells by
  increasing CDC25C, CDK1, cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 amounts and reducing p21 amounts;
  (D) Ref. [] METTL3 upregulated miR-200-5p expression through increasing m6A modification
  level of pri-miR-200-5p, inhibited expression of NFIC and promoted malignant biological
  behavior of ESCC cells; (E) Ref. [] METTL3 elevated miR-320b expression through
  increasing m6A modification level of pri-miR-320b, inhibited expression of PDCD4
  and then activated AKT signaling pathway, leading to lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic
  metastasis of ESCC cells; (F) Ref. [] ATXN2 bound to TNFR1 methylated by METTL3
  (upregulated in ESCC samples) and augmented translation of TNFR1. TNFR1 promoted
  malignant behavior of ESCC cells, such as proliferation, migration and invasion,
  by activating MAPK and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways.
