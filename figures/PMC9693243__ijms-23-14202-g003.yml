caption: 'Comparative analysis of enriched KEGG pathways of RI and A3SS genes between
  J and SD in response to A. alternata AP infection. (A) Pathway enrichment of RI
  genes of J and SD in response to A. alternata AP infection. (B) Pathway enrichment
  of A3SS genes of J and SD in response to A. alternata AP infection. J: overlapped
  J36 and J72 groups; SD: overlapped SD36 and SD72 groups. The adjusted-p values are
  given with the color bar. The rich factor is noted at the x-axis and gene numbers
  are indicated by bubble scale.'
