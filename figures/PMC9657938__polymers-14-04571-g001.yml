caption: 'Custom production process allows for facile fabrication of fibrous PCL scaffolds
  for engineered heart tissue. (A) Image of wet-spinning process: a syringe pump {1}
  extrudes PCL solution {2} into a coagulating ethanol bath {3} through a blunt needle
  {4} to precipitate a solid PCL fiber {5}. (B) Image of Arduino-controlled mandrel.
  Mandrel rotates and translates to position fibers into a scaffold with user-defined
  spacing and angle inputs. (C) PDMS gaskets are embedded in 3D-printed polycarbonate
  press-fit capture frames and autoclaved. (D) Capture frames are used to remove fibers
  from the mandrel and prepare scaffolds for tissue culture. (E) Differentiation of
  hiPSC-CMs and formation of engineered tissues: iPSCs are differentiated into CMs
  using a Wnt signaling pathway, expanded, purified, and combined with a collagen
  hydrogel to produce engineered heart tissues.'
