caption: a Immunoblot analysis of HSP90 and COX2 proteins in A549 cell line. A549
  cells were pre-treated with or without FA 100μM for 1h and then with LPS 100ngr/ml
  for 4h. Total proteins were extracted, and immunoblot analysis of HSP 90 and COX2
  protein level was effectuated. Representative immunoblotting results show limited
  changes on the protein level. Histogram is representative of the means ± SD of three
  replicates after normalization with actin. Protein levels are reported in arbitrary
  units as fold increase or decrease compared to controls that are set to 1. Asterisks
  (*) indicate significant differences among groups (* p < 0.05). b HSP90 and COX2
  activities are altered in A549 cell line. Expression levels of HSP90 and COX2 mRNA
  in A 549 cells. The cells were treated as above. Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA
  was analyzed by qPCR. Levels are expressed in arbitrary units as fold increase compared
  to controls assumed as1, using the endogenous gene HPRT. The data shown represents
  three independent experiments. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences among
  groups (** p < 0.01).
