figure_title: Overview of canonical WNT-β-catenin and non-canonical WNT5A-ROR signaling
caption: WNT signaling was initially classified into two major branches based on the
  distinct phenotypes induced by overexpression of different WNT ligands in Xenopus
  laevis. (A) The axis duplication phenotype induced by overexpression of canonical
  WNTs. Image from () in which Xenopus WNT8B was overexpressed. (B) The gross tissue
  truncation/malformation phenotype induced by overexpression of noncanonical WNTs.
  Image from () in which Xenopus WNT5A was overexpressed. (C and D) Molecular schematics
  of the canonical WNT-β-catenin (C) and non-canonical WNT5A-ROR (D) signaling cascades.
