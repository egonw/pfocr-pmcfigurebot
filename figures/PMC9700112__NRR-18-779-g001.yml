caption: 'Schematic illustration of the potential mechanisms underlying glucose deficiency-induced
  AD.In the brain of sporadic AD patients, blocked glucose availability leads to decreased
  O-GlcNAcylation of proteins in neurons. Insufficient O-GlcNAcylation, which leads
  to mitochondria dysfunction, may be a key pathway underlying critical AD features
  such as tau protein tangles, amyloid beta plaques, and neurodegeneration. Understanding
  the mechanism behind certain concepts is crucial in developing sporadic AD therapeutics,
  which may be achieved through the use of animal pluripotent stem cell or hPSC-based
  models. AD: Alzheimer’s disease; hPSCs: human pluripotent stem cells. Created with
  BioRender.com.'
