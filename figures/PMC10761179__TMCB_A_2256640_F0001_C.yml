caption: SNAI2 is required for NOTCH1 expression in FN-RMS cells. (A) Representation
  of pathways downregulated in shSNAI2 knockdown cells compared to shScrambled (Scr)
  RD and SMS-CTR cells. Number of genes in each class is on the Y axis. The highlighted
  box indicates Log 2-fold change in expression of Notch pathway genes comparing the
  RNA-seq data in shSNAI2 vs shScr cells. (B) GSEA analysis showing distribution of
  Notch pathway genes in shSNAI2 compared to shScr RD cells. Less than 0 enrichment
  score indicates downregulated gene sets in shSNAI2 sample. (C) Relative gene expression
  via real time qPCR of cancer pathway genes in shSNAI2 knockdown compared to shScr
  RD and SMS-CTR cells grown in differentiation media. * < 0.05, ** < 0.001, *** <
  0.0001 P-value by Student’s t test, error bars represent standard deviation of three
  technical replicates. (D) Protein expression of Intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1), Intracellular
  NOTCH2 (ICN2), and Intracellular NOTCH3 (ICN3) in shSNAI2 knockdown compared to
  shScr in RD and SMS-CTR cells, β-tubulin was used as loading control.
