caption: Plant UPRome workflow. The database was constructed based on the reported
  unfolded protein response (UPR) associated genes in model plant species esp.  Arabidopsis
  thaliana . Homology based gene retrieval was carried out against major plant genome
  databases as indicated in the second panel. The retrieved genes were manually curated
  after careful inspection of their sequences, domains, and motifs as shown in the
  top third panel. We also incorporated a feed aggregator so the users can obtain
  up to date references related to the six plant species included in our database.
  We used Microsoft ASP.net, C#, Bootstrapper, and Microsoft SQL Server for the implementation
  of the Plant UPRome.
