caption: Exosomeâ€“recipient cell communication. Exosomes communicate with and modulate
  recipient cell signaling via multiple routes. Upon reaching the target cell, (1)
  ligands on the exosome surface membrane and receptors on the plasma membrane of
  the target cell can interact, inducing downstream signaling cascade in the recipient
  cell. (2) Exosome membrane can fuse with the plasma membrane and release its contents
  directly into the cytosol of the recipient cell. (3) Exosomes are internalized by
  the recipient cell and follow the endosomal pathway for cargo release/recycling.
