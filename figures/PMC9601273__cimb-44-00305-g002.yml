caption: 'Regulation of angiogenesis via the canonical NF-κB pathway in CRC. The extracellular
  compounds BAY11-7082, crocin, Q8, and PT inhibit the expression of VEGFA by suppressing
  the phosphorylation of IκB. While GNA13 promotes angiogenesis through the regulation
  of chemokines production. AP restrains IL-8 production and angiogenesis by inhibiting
  the degradation of IκB, then prevents NF-κB from entering the nucleus. SAFB targets
  the promoter of TAK1 in the nucleus and inhibits angiogenesis. The expression of
  miR-375 can downregulate MTDH level, leading to the inhibitory effect of IκBα on
  NF-κB. Q8: IUPAC name (E)-2-(2-quinolin-2-yl-vinyl)-benzene-1,4-diol HCl; AP: Andrographolide;
  PT: Parthenolide; IKK: IκB kinase complex; SAFB: scaffold attachment factor B; MTDH:
  metadherin.'
