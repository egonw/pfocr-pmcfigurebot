caption: Transcriptome changes during escape from TIS. (a) Representative images of
  glycogen (left panel, blue arrow) and lipid droplets (right panel, black arrow)
  of IRI-treated senescence MCF-7 cells. Pictures were taken with the use of transmission
  electron microscope. GSEA analysis of the MCF-7 cells transcriptome on D3 compared
  to control after IRI. Positive enrichment in the indicated GOBP (gene ontology biological
  processes) pathway is shown. (b) GSEA analysis of the MCF-7 cells transcriptome
  on D3 compared to control after IRI treatment. Positive enrichment in indicated
  KEGG and HALLMARK pathways is shown. (c) GSEA analysis of the MCF-7 cells transcriptome
  on D8 compared to D3 after IRI treatment. Positive enrichment in the indicated GO
  pathway is shown. Heatmaps representing GOBP Meiotic Cell Cycle, HALLMARK EPITHELIAL
  MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION and HALLMARK SPERMATOGENESIS were prepared on differentially
  expressed genes from the respective gene set.
