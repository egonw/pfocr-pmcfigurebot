caption: DKK4 inhibits CRC cell metastasis but not proliferation in vivo.A, representative
  bioluminescence images of tumors in nude mice are shown after tail vein injection
  of DKK4-knockdown HCT116 cells and control cells (n = 5). The scale bars represent
  20 mm. ∗∗p < 0.01. B, H&E staining of lung tissues and the number of metastases
  from the different groups are shown. The scale bars represent left, 1000 μm; right,
  100 μm. ∗p < 0.05. C, representative bioluminescence images of the tumors are shown
  after the subcutaneous injection of DKK4-knockdown HCT116 cells or control cells
  in nude mice (n = 5). The scale bars represent 20 mm. N.S., not significant. D,
  the tumor volumes were measured every 3 days. The tumor weights were collected at
  21 days and compared in nude mice subcutaneously injected with DKK4-knockdown HCT116 cells
  and control cells (n= 5). N.S., not significant. CRC, colorectal cancer.
