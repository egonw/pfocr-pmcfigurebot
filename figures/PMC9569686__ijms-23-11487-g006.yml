caption: 'Sex-based analysis of the systolic blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy
  in Npr1 0-copy, 1-copy, and wild-type 2-copy male and female control and GW788388-treated
  mice: the SBP, HW/BW, LV/BW, and TL/HW ratios are shown in panels (A–D). Values
  are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 6 animals in each group). Statistical significance
  is expressed as # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001, vehicle-treated 0-copy and
  1-copy vs. 2-copy; ** p < 0.01, vehicle-treated 0-copy, 1-copy and 2 copy vs. drug-treated
  same gene copy number. NS: not significant.'
