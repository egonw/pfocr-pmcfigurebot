caption: Schematic of the physiologically based lung compartment. Alveolar space is
  shown for demonstration, but the upper airway and lower airway pathways follow the
  same schematic as the alveolar pathway. The sub-compartments are connected in an
  anatomical manner including blood, lymph, 2-pore paracellular flow between vascular
  and interstitial space, permeability surface area product of drugs across ELF Space.
  The Endothelial and Epithelial space implies the endosomal space in these compartments
  and accounts for FcRn mediated transcytosis and endosomal uptake through micropinocytosis
  (. The plasma, endothelial and interstitial space mimics the process as in the generic
  tissue structure of the model. The paracellular transport across Interstitial and
  ELF space is reflected by  process. The drug in the airways is deposited on the
  epithelial lining fluid,  is the rate of deposition and  reflects the rate at which
  undeposited drug is disposed from the airway space
