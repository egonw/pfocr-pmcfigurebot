caption: Pathway analysis of acute and chronic hypoxia in MCF-7 and HCC1143 cell lines.
  A Top10 Canonical pathways identified by IPA ranked by p-value in acute and chronic
  hypoxia in MCF-7 and HCC1143 cell lines. The color range from orange to yellow to
  green reflects –log(p-value) from low to high. The length of the blue bar reflects
  the higher –log(p-value). B–E Networks with gene interactions indicated by pink
  lines drawn by IPA for canonical pathways, including Glycolysis (B) and Role of
  CHK protein in cell cycle checkpoint control (C) in MCF-7 cells exposed to chronic
  hypoxia; and ILK signaling (D) and Cyclins and cell cycle regulation (E) in HCC1143
  cells exposed to chronic hypoxia. F, G KEGG pathway analysis in chronic hypoxia
  in MCF-7 (F) and HCC1143 (G) cells. Pathways associated with HIF signaling (red),
  metabolism (green), and cytoskeleton (orange) are marked both in IPA (A) and KEGG
  (F, G)
