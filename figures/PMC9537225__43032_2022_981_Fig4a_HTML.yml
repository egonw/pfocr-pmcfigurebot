caption: (Aâ€“B) The interaction network of significant pathway (Path-Net) is a functional
  mapping analysis according to KEGG pathway analysis to visualize the differentially
  upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) expression of SE-associated mRNAs in different
  clusters. Nods represent different signaling pathways. Lines indicate a trigger
  relationship between significant pathways
