caption: PDIA4 knockdown induced sensitivity of RT in murine xenografts. A Tumor volume
  was measured at the indicated days with/without IR (two-way ANOVA; n = 5; *, P < 0.05;
  ***, P < 0.001). B Photograph of the dissected tumors. C Immunohistochemical staining
  (Ki67) and TUNEL staining of PDIA4 xenograft tumor sections with/without IR. D Tumor
  weight was measured in the indicated groups with/without IR (t test; n = 5; *, P < 0.05;
  ***, P < 0.001)
