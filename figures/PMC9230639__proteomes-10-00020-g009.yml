caption: Most significantly enriched GO biological processes in upregulated transcripts.
  Using Panther pathway analysis in upregulated transcripts and with correction for
  false discovery rate, no GO biological processes were enriched. In case the FDR
  was too conservative and the biological processes were spread across many processes,
  the FDR correction was removed and the analysis repeated. This identified 606 GO
  biological processes—the full list is shown in . Redundant terms were merged together
  and processes not directly relevant to the cell type were removed. The top 10 enriched
  biological processes are shown with their mean fold enrichment, and the significance
  determined by t-tests is indicated by the p value. Many enriched pathways had a
  fold-change of >100, and in these cases, had only one transcript identified as belonging
  to that pathway in both the full list of transcripts and the upregulated transcripts.
  Other enriched biological processes had a fold-change enrichment of 59.38 and had
  one of two identified transcripts in the full dataset that were present in the upregulated
  transcripts.
