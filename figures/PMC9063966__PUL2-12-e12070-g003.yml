caption: 'TPT ameliorates pulmonary inflammation and edema in acute lung injury induced
  by cecal ligation and puncture. (a) Hematoxylin and eosin staining for lung tissues
  in the sham, CLP, CLP + TPT, and CLP + PDTC groups. (b) Lung injury scores. (c) Lung
  injury in the harvested lung tissue. (d) Lung edema. **p < 0.01: CLP group versus
  sham group. #p < 0.05: CLP + TPT group versus CLP group. &​​​​p < 0.05: CLP + PDTC
  group versus CLP group. ALI, acute lung injury; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture;
  PDTC, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; TPT, topotecan.'
article_title: Topotecan reduces sepsis‐induced acute lung injury and decreases the
  inflammatory response via the inhibition of the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
