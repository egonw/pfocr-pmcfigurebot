caption: Effect of RSV on adenylyl cyclase activity from HeLa and SH-SY5Y intact cells.
  (A) Basal adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. (B) The A2AR-mediated signaling pathway
  using 10 µM CGS21680, a selective agonist for A2AR, represented as the percentage
  with respect to basal activity of the enzyme. (C) The A1R-mediated signaling using
  CPA, a potent agonist for A1R, represented as the percentage of inhibition of the
  50 μM forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Data are mean ± SEM of three independent
  samples. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 significantly different from their corresponding
  controls according to Student’s t-test.
