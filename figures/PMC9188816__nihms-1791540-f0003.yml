figure_title: Downregulation of progenitor maintenance/placodal genes, Notch and Fgf-
  signaling 0min after HC death
caption: '(A) Heatmap of selected cell type-specific downregulated genes 0min after
  neomycin treatment.(B) Dot plot of the average expression of progenitor/stem cell
  maintenance/placodal genes during HC regeneration. The size of the dots represents
  the proportion of cells expressing the gene.(C) ISH images of gata2b, gpx1a, and
  sox2 expression during HC regeneration. Bottom two rows: ISH of sox2 in siblings
  and atoh1a CRISPR mutants during homeostasis and 0min after neomycin treatment.(D
  and E) Dot plots of the average expression of Notch (D) and Fgf (E) pathway members
  during HC regeneration.(F) Enrichment term analysis of downregulated genes 0min
  after HC death compared to all other time points.'
