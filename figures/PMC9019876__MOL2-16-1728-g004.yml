caption: DCZ0415 inhibits the downstream signalling pathway of TRIP13. (A) Western
  blot analysis of TRIP13, p‐EGFR, FGFR4 and p‐STAT3 protein expressions in CRC cells
  transfected with TRIP13 shRNA. (B) Western blot analysis showing the levels of FGFR4
  in lysates of CRC cells treated with DCZ0415. (C) For various cells, the levels
  of p‐STAT3, t‐STAT3, p‐EGFR and t‐EGFR, determined by western blot analysis, were
  assessed after CRC cells were exposed to DCZ0415. (D) For various cells, the levels
  of p‐IKKα/β and p‐NF‐κBp65, determined by western blot analysis, were assessed after
  CRC cells were exposed to DCZ0415. (E) PARP protein expression in DCZ0415‐treated
  CRC cells. (F) Apoptosis was quantified by Annexin V/PI staining after the treatment
  of CRC cells with DCZ0415 (10 and 20 µm) for 48 h. The experiments had three replicates.
