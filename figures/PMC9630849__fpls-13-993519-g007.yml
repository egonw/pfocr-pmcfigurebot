caption: Top 20 KEGG pathways enriched in different comparison groups over the F.
  fujikuroi inoculation time. (A–C) are the scatter plots of the enrichment statistics
  of the KEGG pathway in S88_3.vs.S88_0, S88_5.vs.S88_3, and S88_5.vs.S88_0, respectively.
  The abscissa in the figure is x/y (the rate of the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding metabolic pathway to the total number of metabolites identified
  in the pathway), and the larger the values indicate, the higher the enrichment of
  differential metabolites in the pathway. The color of the dot represents the p-value
  of the hypergeometric test, and the smaller the values stand for, the greater the
  reliability of the test and the more statistically significant. The size of the
  dot represents the number of different metabolites in the corresponding pathway.
  The larger the dot indicates the more differential metabolites in the pathway.
