caption: MC-secreted histamine amplified the LPS-induced inflammatory response in
  BMVECs through the H1R-TLR2/4-MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Expression levels of TLR2/4
  and MAPK signaling pathway proteins (P38, P42/44 and JNK) in P815-bEnd.3 co-culture
  system were analyzed by Western blot (n=3). (B) Expression levels of TLR2/4 and
  MAPK signaling pathway proteins (P38, P42/44 and JNK) in the P815-bEnd.3 co-culture
  system were quantified and normalized to GAPDH levels (n=3). (C) Expression levels
  of H1R were checked by Western blot after bEnd.3 cells were over-expressed with
  H1R (n=3). (D) Expression levels of TLR2/4-MAPK signaling pathway proteins were
  checked by Western blot after bEnd.3 cells were over-expressed with H1R (n=3). (E)
  Expression levels of TLR2/4-MAPK signaling pathway proteins were quantified and
  normalized to GAPDH levels after bEnd.3 cells were over-expressed with H1R (n=3).
  (F) ELISA showed the changes of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10 in medium supernatant
  after bEnd.3 cells were over-expressed with H1R (n=3). LPS, Lipopolysaccharide;
  MCs, Mast cells; H1R, histamine 1 receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MAPK, Mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; (ns, no significance, *p <0.05, ** p <0.01, *** p <0.001, ****
  p <0.0001).
