caption: Dominant active β-catenin alters the epigenetic and transcription profile
  of DP thymocytes by redirecting Tcf-1 binding. (A) Histogram overlays of Tcf-1 binding
  centered on Tcf-1–bound regions in Cre DP thymocytes (±1.5 kb, Top) and Venn diagram
  of overlapping Tcf-1 peaks between Cre and CAT DP thymocytes. (B) Heat maps of ChIP-seq
  peaks for Tcf-1 and indicated histone marks, centered on Tcf-1 binding (±3 kb) at
  shared or unique sites as indicated. (C) Comparative enrichment histograms of histone
  modifications associated with active promoters (H3K9/14Ac), active enhancers (H3K27ac),
  transcription (H3K4Me3), and closed/poised chromatin (H3K27me3). (D) CDF plot of
  expression changes in genes uniquely bound by Tcf-1 in CAT DP thymocytes (n = 2819,
  red line) compared to all genes (blue line). (E) Pathway analysis of down-regulated
  (blue) and up-regulated (red) genes uniquely bound by Tcf-1 in CAT (Top) and the
  most significantly enriched transcription factor binding motifs (HOMER, Bottom).
  (F) Comparative enrichment histograms for histone modifications (H3K9/14Ac, H3K27ac,
  H3K4Me3, and H3K27Me3) centered on CAT-unique Tcf-1 binding sites corresponding
  to up- or down-regulated genes in CAT versus Cre as indicated. (G) Pathway analysis
  of cluster 1 (blue, Top) and cluster 6 (red, Bottom) genes uniquely bound by Tcf-1
  in CAT. (H) The most significantly enriched transcription factor binding motifs
  (HOMER) of cluster 1 (Left) and cluster 6 (Right) genes uniquely bound by Tcf-1
  in CAT. (I) Pie charts show the distrubution of CAT unique Tcf-1 binding sites to
  PR, PE, or AE of genes associated with cluster 1 and cluster 6. (J) Representative
  enrichment tracks (Integrated Genome Browser), of Tcf-1, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq
  in Cre or CAT DP thymocytes as indicated, showing key replication and repair genes
  that are differentially expressed and have novel Tcf-1 sites in CAT (yellow boxes).
