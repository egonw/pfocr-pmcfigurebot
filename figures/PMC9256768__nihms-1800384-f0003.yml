figure_title: The effects of ST1072 or FTY720 on GVH and GVL responses
caption: BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with 5 × 106/mouse
  TCD-BM (Ly5.1+) or plus purified T cells (1×106) from B6 mice and mixed-lineage
  leukemia (MLL) as well. The recipient mice were injected i.p. with ST1072 or FTY720
  at 1mg/kg per mouse/day from day −1 to day14. The mice were monitored for clinical
  score (A) survival (B) and tumor mortality (C). Data shown here is from two independent
  experiments (n=10 per group). For comparison of recipient survival and tumor mortality
  among groups, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance.
  Clinical scores were compared using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Asterisks
  indicate statistical significance *p< 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
