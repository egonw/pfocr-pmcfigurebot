caption: Different expression RNAs from data between TCGA and GTEx is analyzed. (A)
  Volcano map of significantly different expression of mRNAs. Red spots represent
  up-regulated genes, and blue spots represent down-regulated genes. (B) Volcano map
  of significantly different expression of lncRNAs. (C) Volcano map of significantly
  different expression of miRNAs. (D) Information from up-regulated genes was applied
  to GO analysis in BP, CC, and MF. (E) Gene symbols and interaction of the significantly
  up-regulated mRNAs in BP were shown. (F) KEGG-GSEA was applied for signaling pathway
  analysis. BP = biological process, CC = cellular component, GO = gene ontology,
  GTEx = the Genotype-Tissue Expression, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes,
  lncRNAs = long non-coding RNAs, MF = molecular function, mRNAs = messenger RNAs,
  miRNAs = microRNAs, TCGA = The Cancer Genome Atlas.
