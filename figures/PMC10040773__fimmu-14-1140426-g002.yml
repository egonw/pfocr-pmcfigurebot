caption: Metabolic analysis of splenic CD4+ T cells from B6 and P2rx7-/- mice at early
  Plasmodium infection. Foxp3.GFP and Foxp3.GFP+P2rx7-/- mice were infected i.p. with
  1 x 106 iRBCs and analyzed 6 days later. (A) Dot plots show forward side scatter
  area (FSC-A) and CD11a expression in Foxp3-CD4+ T cells. Blue dots identify T-bet+Bcl6+
  cells. Column bar graph shows CD11a+ cell frequencies in the Foxp3-CD4+ T cell population.
  (B) Histograms show FSC-A of CD11a+Foxp3-CD4+ T cells. Column bar graphs show FSC-A
  medians. (C) The heatmap of label-free quantitative data shows upregulated proteins
  in red and downregulated proteins in green. (D) Functional groups of biological
  pathways defined by Reactome Database show upregulated proteins. (E) Enrichment
  of metabolic pathways defined by Reactome Database is shown. The upregulated proteins
  are provided in the interaction network and their first nodes. (F and G) Real time
  changes in extracellular consumption acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) were measured using a Seahorse XFe96 bioanalyzer. (F) The first arrow
  indicates the injection of glucose to increase the glycolytic pathway, followed
  by oligomycin to enhance the glucose consumption (second arrow) and 2-deox-D-glucose
  (2DG) to inhibit glycolysis (third arrow). (G) The first arrow indicates the injection
  of oligomycin that promotes a metabolic stress, followed by a mitochondrial decoupler
  carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoro-methoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) to determine the maximal
  respiratory capacity (second arrow) and antimycin A/rotenone to block the electron
  transport chain (third arrow). Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 4) of one representative
  experiment out of three. Significant differences were observed for the (-) indicated
  groups with p < 0.05, using the Mann Whitney U.
