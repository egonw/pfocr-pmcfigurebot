caption: 'Summary of the cellular processes regulated by NAD/NAMPT axis and its connections
  with the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD
  biosynthesis starting from nicotinamide (Nam) that, in turn, is released by NAD-consuming
  enzymes (PARPs and Sirtuins mainly involved in DNA repair and epigenetics). The
  BRAF oncogenic signaling and NAMPT/NAD pathway are connected in melanoma: the activation
  of BRAF-mutated pathway promotes NAMPT transcription and NAD metabolism; on the
  other hand, NAMPT overexpression support MAPK activation in a positive loop. Increased
  levels of NAMPT and NAD sustains energetic metabolism and drives drug resistance
  mechanisms. NAMPT can be also released by melanoma cells, through unknown mechanisms,
  acting as cytokine binding to TLR4 and/or CCR5 and triggering intracellular signaling.
  In the microenvironment of melanoma the function of eNAMPT has not been well established,
  however, in other tumor models it can create immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting
  conditions modulating immune responses. Note that NAMPT inhibition (using pharmacological
  agents and/or neutralizing antibody) can play a role in blocking melanoma growth
  and progression, counteracting BRAF inhibitors resistance and impacting on tumor
  microenvironment. i: inhibitors; ICI: immune checkpoint inhibitors; NMN: nicotinamide
