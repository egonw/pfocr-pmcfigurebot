caption: It seems circKMT2E can activate the SIRT1 signaling pathway by the sponge
  function to miR-204-5p. (a) The structure of circKMT2E located between the fourth
  and fifteenth exons of the KMT2E gene. (b) The assumed binding sites of miR-204-5p
  on circKMT2E. (c) Detailed annotation of the predicted binding site sequence between
  circKMT2E and miR-204-5p. The “2D Structure” column displays the combining sequence
  of circKMT2E and miR-204-5p. The “Local AU” shows the upstream and downstream of
  30 nucleotides of the seed sequence. The “Position” column exhibits the possible
  situation of miRNA response elements on circRNA sequence. (d) miR-204-5p possesses
  binding site for SIRT1.
