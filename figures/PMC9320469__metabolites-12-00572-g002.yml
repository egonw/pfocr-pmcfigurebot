caption: Pathway-associated metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) for TPS vs.
  CONT. (A) Plot showing affected biological processes in transgenerationally stressed
  (TPS) compared to non-stressed (CONT) rats based on metabolites identified as significantly
  altered between these groups. The p-value for each pathway is shown using the heatmap
  on the right of the figure and the fold enrichment shows how many times greater
  than chance the process is involved. (B) Metabolomic pathway analysis showing all
  matched pathways according to p-values from pathway enrichment analysis and pathway
  impact values from pathway topology analysis in TPS and non-stressed CONT rats.
  The y-axis shows the negative natural log of p, such that a higher value on the
  y-axis gives a lower p-value. The x-axis gives the pathway impact, which correlates
  to the number of metabolite hits in a particular pathway. Only metabolic pathways
  with p < 0.05 are labeled. TPS had the highest impact on valine, leucin, and isoleucine
  biosynthesis.
