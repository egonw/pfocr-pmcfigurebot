caption: Metabolome-based analysis of metabolites associated with pigment synthesis.
  (A) PCA analysis, PC1 describes the most obvious features in the multidimensional
  data matrix, and PC2 describes the most significant features in the data matrix
  except PC1. (B) OPLS-DA, use the classification effect of R2X, R2Y, Q2 models. (C)
  DEM VIP map, color on the right side indicates the abundance of each metabolite
  in different groups, red represents upregulated, and green represents downregulated.
  The higher the VIP values, the more they contribute to distinguishing samples. The
  metabolites with VIP exceeding 1 have significant differences. (D) DEM heat map,
  each row and column represents the sample, and the darker the color, the stronger
  the correlation between the two samples.
