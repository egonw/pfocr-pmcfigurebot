caption: Hepatic Acat2 overexpression promotes cholesterol metabolism and bile acid
  biosynthesis pathways in mouse liver. (a) Heatmap of DEGs enriched in cholesterol
  metabolism and ketone metabolic process. (b) Pathway showing enzymes involved in
  cholesterol metabolism and ketone metabolic process; red boxes represent enzymes
  encoded by upregulated genes and blue boxes represent those encoded by downregulated
  genes in Acat2-overexpressing mouse liver. (c, d) Heatmap of metabolites of bile
  acids and cholesterol (c), and the relative amount of deoxycholic acid in the liver
  of control and AAV9-Acat2-injected mice. Red arrows indicate two important bile
  acids. Data represent meanÂ± SEM. *p<0.05 (two-tailed t test). DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate; Farnesyl-pp, farnesyl-pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  MVAP, mevalonatephosphate
