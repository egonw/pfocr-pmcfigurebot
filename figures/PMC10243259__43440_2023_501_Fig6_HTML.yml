  e cabozantinib; f sunitinib; g idelalisib; h duvelisib; i ripretinib; j daridorexant;
  k desvenlafaxine. Desvenlafaxine is the O-demethylated (main) metabolite of venlafaxine
  formed by the CYP2D6 pathway (red ellipsis). N-Demethylation of venlafaxine is a
  minor metabolic pathway and occurs via CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 (blue ellipsis)
