caption: Perturbations of the adenosine system in schizophrenia and cancer. Overview
  of the population and biochemical evidence for perturbed adenosine system function
  in schizophrenia and cancer. Reduced cancer rates in schizophrenia patients despite
  elevated cancer risk implies some underlying biochemical protective mechanism. Reduced
  extracellular adenosine availability, and hypouricemia observed in these patients
  may explain the reduced cancer rates. Generated in Biorender.
