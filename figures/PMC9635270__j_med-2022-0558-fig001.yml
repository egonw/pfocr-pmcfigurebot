caption: HOXA10 was highly expressed in EC tissues and cells. (a) The HOXA10 expression
  was elevated in primary tumor tissues, which was analyzed by TCGA (a), GEPIA (a′),
  and UCSC Xena (a″) databases. (b) The HOXA10 mRNA level was increased in EC cell
  lines containing Eca-109, EC9706, TE-1, and KYSE150. (c) The HOXA10 protein level
  was promoted in EC cell lines. Each experiment repeated three times. *p  < 0 .05,
  **p  <  0.01, ***p  <  0.001.
article_title: HOXA10 enhances cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in esophageal
  cancer via activating p38/ERK signaling pathway.
