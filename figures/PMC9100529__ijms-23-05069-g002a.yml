caption: Radiosensitization effects of A3G knockdown on pancreatic cancer MIAPaCa2
  cells and changes in cell cycle distribution and DNA damage response pathway. (A)
  The effect of A3G knockdown by a different siRNA (siA3G-3) on radiosensitization
  in pancreatic cancer MIAPaCa2 cell line after γ-irradiation by colony formation
  assay. (B) Effects of two different siRNAs (siA3G-1 and siA3G-3) on cell cycle distribution
  24 h after γ-irradiation. Asterisks show p < 0.05. (C–F) Effect of siA3G-1 and siA3G-3
  on the expression of proteins related to DDR and cell proliferation using Western
  blot analysis. Relative expression levels of proteins first normalized by β-actin,
  then normalized again to no irradiation controls are shown under each panel. In
  (C), the values of normalization for siA3G-1 are obtained by comparison with the
  second left-most lane in the left-most panel and shown with underlines. In addition,
  for phosphorylated proteins, the ratio of the phosphorylated protein/total protein
  was shown as indicated for (D–F).
