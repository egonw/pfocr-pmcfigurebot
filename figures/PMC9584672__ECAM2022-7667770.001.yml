caption: 'Effect of PF on cell viability, LDK and CK-MB level in H/R induced H9c2
  cells. H9c2 cells were added with PF (50, 100, 200 μM) for 2 h and then subjected
  to H/R stimulation. (a) MTT assay was used to analyze the cell viability. (b) LDK
  leakage assay was used to assess the cytotoxic effect of PF in H9c2 cells. (c) ELISA
  was performed to assess the CK-MB levels in H9c2 cells. N = 3, ∗P < 0.05 vs. control.
  #P < 0.05 vs. H/R.'
