caption: Ddx3x overexpression ameliorated Dox‐induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. “+”
  symbol denotes presence and “−” symbol denotes absence of the corresponding treatment
  condition. (A) The RT‐qPCR analysis evaluated the efficiency of Ddx3x plasmids transfection.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM. **p < 0.01. (B) The protein level of DDX3X, Casp‐3,
  and cleaved Casp‐3 in H9c2 cells treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x plasmids
  transfection. Data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant;
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (C) Flow cytometric analysis detected the apoptosis ratio
  of H9c2 cardiomyocytes treated with Dox (2 μM) following Ddx3x plasmids transfection.
  The data are presented as means ± SEM. ns, p ≥ 0.05 refers to not significant; *p < 0.05.
  (D) Mito‐Tracker Red CMXRos and Hoechst 33342 staining were detected respectively
  mitochondrial morphology and nuclear condensation of H9c2 cells treated with Dox
  (2 μM) following Ddx3x plasmids transfection. Scale bar = 50 μm
