figure_title: Pharmacological modulation of healthy aging with urolithin A, NAD+,
  resveratrol and spermidine
caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by elevated cytoplasmic calcium
  levels, ATP depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential failure, and increased reactive
  oxygen species production. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with DNA
  damage and defective mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitophagy enhancers like Urolithin
  A, NAD+, Resveratrol and Spermidine, and physical exercise, promote effective mitophagy,
  mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis through the Sirtuin pathway.
  Pharmacological induction of PGC-1a through the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway stimulates mitochondrial
  biogenesis and improves mitochondrial health. PGC-1a and NRF2 activity affects mitochondrial
  detoxification and mitophagy induction. Pharmacological modulation of mitophagy
  and mitochondrial biogenesis may play an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis
  during stress, promoting healthy aging.
