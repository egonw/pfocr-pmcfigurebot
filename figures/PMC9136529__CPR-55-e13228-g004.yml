caption: Lithocholic acid (LCA) led to cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase. IEC‐6 cells
  were treated with 120 μM LCA for 24 h and detected by RNA sequencing. (A) Heat map
  of DEGs related to cell cycle. (B) Bar graph of the top 20 results from the KEGG
  enrichment analysis ranked by −log10 (padj). (C) Gene set enrichment analysis revealed
  negative enrichment of cell cycle. (D) Expression of cyclins and cyclin‐dependent
  kinases under treatment with different dose of LCA (60–180 μM) for 24 h. (E,F) Cell
  cycle progression was assessed by flow cytometry after treatment of cells with 80,
  120 and 160 μM LCA for 24 h. *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p <0.001 compared to control
  by one‐way ANOVA. Data provided are the mean ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments, and bar graphs represent the mean with error bars indicating SD
