caption: 'A: Examples of RE''s SOM model (a: min-SOM model U-Matrix and pie chart,
  b–d: component plane); B: examples of SARE''s SOM model (a: min-SOM model U-Matrix
  and pie chart, b–d: component plane). Self-organizing maps (SOM) were used to predict
  metabolic molecule classification models for RE and SARE. The heatmaps were used
  to visualize the differences. The larger was the value, the darker is the color.
  (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
