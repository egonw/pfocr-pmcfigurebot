caption: 'The DDX58 agonist, SB9200, inhibits colon cancer progression. (A and B)
  Effect of SB9200 on cell proliferation and viability. Cell viability and proliferation
  were detected using MTS and EdU assays, respectively. Representative images were
  obtained. Scale bars, 100 µm. *P<0.05 vs. the 0 µM SB9200 group; #P<0.05 vs. the
  20 µM SB9200 group; &P<0.05 vs. the 40 µM SB9200 group; ∆P<0.05 vs. the 80 µM SB9200
  group. ∇P<0.05 vs. the 120 µM SB9200 group. (C-F) Wound healing and Transwell assays
  were performed to detect the effects of SB9200 on cell migration and invasion. Representative
  images were obtained. Scale bars, 500 µm for wound healing assay. Scale bars, 200
  µm for Transwell assay. All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
  *P<0.05 vs. the 0 µM SB9200 group. (G-I) Effect of SB9200 on the DDX58/pSTAT3/CSE
  pathway. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the level of DDX58, STAT3,
  pSTAT3 and CSE proteins. All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
  *P<0.05 vs. the 0 µM SB9200 group. DExD/H-box helicase 58; CSE, cystathionine-γ-lyase.'
