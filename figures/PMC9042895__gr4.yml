caption: 'GADD45G/p38 MAPK/CDC25B signaling dephosphorylates phospho-CRMP2 and elongates
  neurites(A) Conceptual diagram depicting the inhibition of p38 tyrosine dephosphorylation
  by RK-682.(B) Immunostaining images and a quantitative graph showing that neurospheres
  treated with RK-682 expressed phospho-p38 at higher levels than those not treated
  with RK-682 (n = 3, p = 0.0319).(C) Immunostaining images and quantitative graph
  showing that neurospheres treated with RK-682 expressed phospho-CDC25B at higher
  levels than those not treated with RK-682 (n = 3; p = 0.0162).(D) Immunostaining
  images of α-tubulin and a quantitative graph of the microtubule length. The length
  was greater in the RK-682-treated group than in the untreated group (n = 3; p =
  0.000635).(E) Immunostaining images of β-III tubulin and a quantitative graph of
  the microtubule length. The length was greater in the RK-682-treated group than
  in the untreated group.(F) Immunostaining images of tau and a quantitative graph
  of neurites. Neurites were longer in the RK-682-treated group than in the untreated
  group (n = 3; p = 0.0434).(G) The expression level of phospho-CRMP2 was quantified
  by western blotting in neurons supplemented with RK-682 and neurons not supplemented
  with RK-682.(H) Conceptual diagram of the signaling pathway that causes neurite
  outgrowth. Starting with GADD45G, dephosphorylation of CRMP2 occurs via phosphorylation
  of p38 MAPK and CDC25B, which promotes the polymerization of microtubules and causes
  neurite outgrowth.(I and J) Neurospheres treated with only Compound 34 and with
  both Compound 34 and SB203580 were cultured for 14 days. Differentiated neurons
  were immunostained with β-III tubulin (I) or tau (J). The lengths of microtubules
  and neurites were compared between the SB203580-treated group and the untreated
  group. The extension of neurites was suppressed in the SB203580 group (n = 3; p =
  0.00270, p = 0.00122).(K and L) The lengths of microtubules and neurites were not
  extended by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDC25B. After neuronal differentiation,
  immunostaining of β-III tubulin (K) or tau (L) was performed. Neuronal differentiation
  was not inhibited even in the CDC25B knockdown group (high-magnification image).
  Neurite elongation was inhibited in the CDC25B knockdown group (n = 3; p = 0.00994,
  p = 0.00286).Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired two-tailed Student’s
  t-tests. The values in the bar graphs represent the means ± SEs. 10 neurospheres
  were observed for each experiment. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (C)34: Compound
  34. Scale bars: 100 μm. The neurospheres were derived from the iPSC line 201B7.'
