caption: T and B cells actively participate in regulating bone homeostasis. (A) All
  T cells initially grouped were combined to reconstruct the UMAP profile, with coloration
  labeled by the cell type. From left to right are the KD and OVCF samples, the KD
  sample, and the OVCF sample. (B) Bubble plots of marker genes for the T-cell subcluster,
  with larger dots representing stronger expression and dots colored to distinguish
  KD and OVCF samples. (C) Bar chart of the T-cell subcluster in respective sample
  proportions. (D) Enriched signaling pathways were analyzed using QuSAGE analysis
  for two T-cell subclusters in two samples, with horizontal axis labels representing
  cell types in different samples, vertical axis labels representing signaling pathway
  gene sets, square colors representing statistical probability levels, and darker
  colors indicating greater significance. The orange bubble size indicates relative
  activation, and blue indicates relative inactivity. (E) All B cells initially grouped
  were combined to reconstruct the UMAP profile, with coloration labeled by the cell
  type. From left to right are KD and OVCF samples, the KD sample, and the OVCF sample.
  (F) Bubble plots of marker genes for B-cell subclusters, with larger dots representing
  stronger expression and dots colored to distinguish KD and OVCF samples. (G) Bar
  chart of B-cell subclusters in respective sample proportions. (H) Corresponding
  volcano plots were drawn for the top five differentially highly expressed genes
  up- and downregulated in the KD samples compared with the OVCF samples, with red
  representing differentially upregulated genes and blue representing differentially
  downregulated genes.
