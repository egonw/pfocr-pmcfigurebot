caption: scRNA-seq shows epidermal and dermal cell interactions and mechanical signaling
  pathways in dermal cells in human skin organoid culture. A. Schematic of human skin
  organoid at D48. UMAP plots of epidermal and dermal clusters by unbiased clustering.
  B. CellChat analysis of epidermal and dermal cell interactions. C. CellCall analysis
  of epidermal and dermal cell interactions. D. KEGG analysis shows the regulation
  of the actin cytoskeleton in dermal cells (FB3) (left); Venn diagram shows overlapping
  genes between the Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway, Focal adhesion pathway,
  and FB3 cluster.
