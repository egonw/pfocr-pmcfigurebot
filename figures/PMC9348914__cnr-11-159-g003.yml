figure_title: Functional analysis of the commonly increased genes between the MCAO
  and 5xFAD groups. (A) KEGG pathway analysis of commonly increased genes—significantly
  altered pathways based on FDR q-value. (B) GO analysis of commonly increased genes.
  Top 15 GO terms based on FDR q-value. (C) DAVID functional annotation clustering.
  The top 3 clusters with a significant change are presented
