figure_title: Hippo signaling pathway is activated in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients
  and infected human lung in vitro cell cultures
caption: '(A) Transcriptome analysis of five negative control and autopsy lung samples
  from patients deceased due to SARS-CoV-2 infection are depicted. KEGG pathway database
  was used to examine the Hippo signaling pathway genes in the differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). Heatmap shows the expression levels of the 45 DEGs (p <0.01) involved
  in Hippo signaling pathway. Blue and red colors represent downregulated and upregulated
  genes, respectively. (B) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of COVID-19 lung autopsy tissue
  shows high level of phospho-YAP Ser127 protein (dark brown). SARS-CoV-2 RNA (red)
  presence in COVID-19 lung was confirmed by RNA-FISH (RNAscope). Images are obtained
  at 20x magnification. (C) Western blot analyses of lung ALI cells show activation
  of Hippo-TBK1 pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Proximal lung air-interface
  cultures are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody targeting Spike protein
  was used for probing infection by immunohistochemistry. Cell-specific markers, such
  as Ac-tubulin (ciliated cells) and Mucin5 (mucus cells) were detected by antibody
  probes to define infected cell types. Scale bar 10 μm. (D) Human airway epithelial
  cells (Calu-3) were analyzed with IHC for pYAP127 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in
  uninfected (Mock) and infected cells. Parental and Delta strains were used for infection
  studies. Scale bar: 25 μm. Representative data from three independent studies are
  provided.'
