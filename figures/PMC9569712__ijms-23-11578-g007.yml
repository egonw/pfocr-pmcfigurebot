caption: Effects of ROS scavenging on the adults’ tolerance to (+)-α-pinene in D.
  armandi. The adults of D. armandi reared on normal (control) or 2% NAC diets were
  treated with DMSO or (+)-α-pinene for 24 h. The H2O2 content (A,D) and the activities
  of P450 (B,E) in the midgut of adults were determined spectrophotometrically. (C,F)
  Adults were further treated with (+)-α-pinene, and mortalities were assessed after
  24 h. The asterisk indicates a significant difference between different treatment
  groups (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, independent Student’s t-test). All values are the
  mean ± SE, n = 3.
