caption: Protein network and enriched pathway analysis of differentially ubiquitinated
  proteins in articular cartilageafterinjury.A, pathway analysis of enriched ubiquitinated
  proteins modulated in response to injury using KEGG, Reactome, and Go ontology pathway
  analysis databases. B, ubiquitinated peptides identified in cartilage after injury
  were mapped to proteins and were further analyzed for direct protein–protein interactions
  using STRING database. Disconnected nodes are hidden and only connections based
  on experimental evidence in STRING are shown. Colors present proteins in the same
  cluster. Solid lines represent protein-protein associations in the same cluster.
  Dotted lines represent protein associations at the edges between clusters.
