figure_title: I3P and I3A activate AHR signaling pathway to enhance TSG-6 production
  in MuSCs
caption: A The CYP1B1 expression in MuSCs stimulated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (10 ng/ml
  each) in the presence or absence of CH223191 (100 μM) for 24 h was measured by qRT-PCR.
  B The mRNA and protein levels of TSG-6 in MuSCs stimulated with IFN-γ and TNF-α
  (10 ng/ml each) in the presence or absence of CH223191 (100 μM) for 24 h were respectively
  measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. C Immunofluorescence staining of AHR in MuSCs treated
  with IFN-γ (I, 10 ng/ml) and TNF-α (T, 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of I3P
  (50 μM) and I3A (100 μM) for 24 h. Scale bars, 40 μm. D MuSCs treated with IFN-γ
  (I, 10 ng/ml) and TNF-α (T, 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of I3P (50 μM),
  I3A (100 μM) and CH223191 (CH, 100 μM) were subjected to the cytoplasmic and nuclear
  extraction, and the distribution of AHR in cytoplasm and nucleus was analyzed by
  western blotting analysis. β-ACTIN and LAMINIB1 were served as loading controls
  for cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively. E The CYP1B1 expression in MuSCs
  stimulated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (10 ng/ml each) in the presence or absence of I3P
  (50 μM) and I3A (100 μM) for 24 h was measured by qRT-PCR. F The mRNA and protein
  levels of TSG-6 in MuSCs stimulated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (10 ng/ml each) in the
  presence or absence of I3P (50 μM) and CH223191 (CH, 100 μM) for 24 h were respectively
  measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. G The mRNA and protein levels of TSG-6 in MuSCs stimulated
  with IFN-γ and TNF-α (10 ng/ml each) in the presence or absence of I3A (100 μM)
  and CH223191 (CH, 100 μM) for 24 h were respectively measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA.
  Data were shown as means ± SEM. Data were representative of three experiments with
  similar results. For two-group comparison, statistical analysis was performed by
  Student’s t test. For multiple group comparison, statistical analysis was performed
  by one-way ANOVA test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
