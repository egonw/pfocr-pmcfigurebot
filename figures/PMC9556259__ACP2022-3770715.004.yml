caption: 'MK2206 2HCl suppressed cancer cell proliferation in 4NQO-induced mouse tongue
  tumors. (a) MK2206 2HCl inhibited p-AKT expression in 4NQO-induced mouse tongue
  tumors. (b) Cell proliferation was suppressed by MK2206 2HCl as showed by Ki67 positive
  cells. (c) MK2206 2HCl promoted p21 expression in tongue tumors. All data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01,  ∗P < 0.05 as compared with the blank group, ##P <
  0.01 as compared with the 4NQO+captisol group. Magnification ×400.'
