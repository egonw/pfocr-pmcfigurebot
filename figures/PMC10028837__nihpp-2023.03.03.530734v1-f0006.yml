figure_title: Increased OX resistance in the pgl mutant is associated with a ruffled
  surface morphology, a thicker cell wall and thicker septa between dividing cells
caption: Transmission electron microscopy at 30,000× (left) and 100,000× (right) magnification
  was performed on JE2 (A), pgl (B) and pglcomp (C) cells collected from exponential
  phase cultures grown for 4.5 h in CDMG OX 1 μg/ml normalized to OD600 = 1 in PBS
  before being fixed and thin sections prepared. Representative cells from each strain
  are shown. Scale bars represent 500 nm at 30,000× or 100 nm at 100,000× magnification.
article_title: Metabolic reprogramming and flux to cell envelope precursors in a pentose
  phosphate pathway mutant increases MRSA resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.
