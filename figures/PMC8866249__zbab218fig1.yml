caption: 'Effects of Cutibacterium acnes strain SK137 on Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan.
  (a) Survival curves of worms fed with Escherichia coli OP50 (control; n = 54), C.
  acnes SK137 (n = 49), or 1:1 OP50 and SK137 mixture (n = 53). Worms were 3 days
  old on nominal day 0. (b) The untreated SK137-fed group (control; n = 50); UV-treated
  SK137-fed group (n = 38). Survival curves of C. acnes-fed worms were compared with
  those of OP50-fed worms. (c-f) Survival curves of the wild-type N2, n = 54; (c)
  tir-1 (qd4), n = 57; (d) nsy-1 (ag3), n = 57; (e) sek-1 (km4), n = 45; (f) pmk-1
  (km25), and n = 39, which were fed C. acnes SK137. The survival curves of the mutants
  were compared with those of wild-type N2 worms. Differences in survival were tested
  for significance using the log-rank test. ***P < .001. **P < .01. N.S.: not significant.'
