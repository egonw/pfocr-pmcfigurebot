caption: 'Related genes and signaling pathways affected by CCNB1. (A) DEGS: heat map.
  According to the different expression levels of CCNB1, they are divided into two
  groups: high expression (Green in the right half of the image) and low (Pink in
  the left half of the image) expression. The abscissa is the sample, and the ordinate
  is the gene name. (B) Go and KEGG analysis. (a) Go analysis demonstrated that CCNB1
  and genes significantly associated with CCNB1 alterations mainly enriched extracellular
  matrix organization, leukocyte migration and extracellular structure organization.
  (b) The major enriched pathways were those connected with cell cycle, AMPK, PPAR
  signaling pathway and TGF signaling beta pathway according to the KEGG analysis.
  (C) The genes that are strongly linked to CCNB1.'
article_title: High expression of CCNB1 driven by ncRNAs is associated with a poor
  prognosis and tumor immune infiltration in breast cancer.
