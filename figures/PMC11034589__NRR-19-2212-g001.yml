caption: 'Glyphosate injection inhibits LTP.One day after intraperitoneal injection
  of 30 mg/kg glyphosate or saline, 30â€“34-day-old rats were dissected for LTP studies
  in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. Slices were prepared using a previously
  described method (Izumi et al., 2023). HFS (100 Hz for 1 second, arrow) was delivered
  at the time marked by the arrow. EPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral pathway stimulation
  were potentiated by HFS in slices from control rats (open circles, n = 5) but not
  in slices from rats exposed to glyphosate (closed circles, n = 8). Created with
  Sigmaplot (14.5). These original data have not been submitted or published elsewhere.
  EPSP: Excitatory postsynaptic potentials; HFS: high frequency stimulation; LTP:
  long-term potentiation.'
