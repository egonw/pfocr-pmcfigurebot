caption: 'Exposomeâ€“metabolome interactions: metabolites and metabolic pathways that
  were significantly correlated with the exposome. (A) Spearman''s correlation analysis
  between the exposome and metabolome. (B) Significantly correlated metabolic pathways
  revealed by pathway analysis using the KEGG database (|r| > 0.9; Q-value < 0.05).
  (C) Significant correlations between chemicals and top 20 biological exposome components
  and metabolites (represented by KEGG compound entry) and metabolic pathways revealed
  by Spearman''s correlation networks (|r| > 0.9; Q-value < 0.05), with positive correlations
  shown in blue and negative correlations shown in red. The complete network is provided
  in Supplemental Figure S8.'
