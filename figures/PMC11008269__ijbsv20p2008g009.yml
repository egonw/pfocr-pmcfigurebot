caption: 'Activation of the p53/TGFβ1 Signaling Pathway Promotes EMT. si-Bmi1 transfection
  or H2O2 stimulation was performed in HK2 cells. (A) mRNA levels of TGFβ1 were detected.
  (B & C). Western blotting analysis of p53, TGFβ1, α-SMA, Vimentin, and E-Cadherin,
  with corresponding statistical analysis of relative protein expression levels. (D)
  IF staining for α-SMA, Vimentin, and E-Cadherin, with representative microscopic
  images, and (E) statistical analysis of relative fluorescence intensities. Three
  biological replicates were used per experiment. *: P < 0.05, **: P < 0.01, ***:
  P < 0.001, compared to the control group; ##: P < 0.01, ###: P < 0.001, compared
  to si-Bmi1-transfected or H2O2-treated cells.'
