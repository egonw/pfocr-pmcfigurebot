figure_title: Low expression of GBA1 increases the levels of LRP6 in the cell plasma
  membrane and led to an interaction between GlcCer and LRP6
caption: 'A Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Wnt molecules and Wnt receptors,
  including FZD1-10 and LRP5/6 mRNA, in MHCC-97H cells with stable GBA1 overexpression.
  B, C Western blotting was performed to determine the levels of LRP6 in the cytoplasm
  and plasma membrane in HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation and in MHCC-97H
  cells with stable GBA1 overexpression. D Immunofluorescence staining was used to
  detect the location of LRP6 in the plasma membrane after GBA1 was knockdown in HepG2
  cells. scale bar, 10 μm. E, F Schematic representation of the binding mode of GlcCer
  and YWTD-EGF Domain Pair (PDB code: 1IJQ) of LRP6, Autodock was employed for docking
  and PyMOL was used for graph preparation. G An interaction of endogenous GlcCer
  and LRP6 was detected by PLA in HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation. BF:
  bright field. H Western blotting was performed for the phosphorylation of LRP6 at
  Ser1490 in HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation.'
