figure_title: The role of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in ferroptosis
caption: Cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF bind to their corresponding receptors and
  thus induce the phosphorylation and activation of JAKs. In turn, activated JAKs
  phosphorylate STATs and induce their dimerization and nuclear translocation. Finally,
  STAT dimers bind to DNA sequences to induce the transcription of target genes and
  the activation of downstream signaling pathways. As a downstream target of the JAK-STAT
  pathway, phosphorylated STAT3 can increase hepcidin expression to inhibit iron export,
  resulting in ferroptosis. Moreover, activated STAT1 inhibits System Xc- and exerts
  proferroptosis effects by via modulating IRF1.
