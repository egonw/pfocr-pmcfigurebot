caption: Overview of autophagy activation pathway under stressful or nutrient limiting
  conditions. The ULK initiation complex induces phagophore nucleation, and translocates
  to the endoplasmic reticulum or closely related membranes, where it phosphorylates
  and activates the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, thus producing
  phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on the isolation membrane. PI3P recruits
  specific autophagy effectors that contribute to ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex formation,
  which promotes microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) in conjugation
  with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), with the participation of ATG proteins. When
  the isolation membrane elongates and closes to form the autophagosome, lipidated
  LC3 (LC3-II) is integrated in the autophagosome, thus becoming a common autophagosome
  marker. As the autophagosome matures, it fuses with the lysosome to produce the
  autophagolysosome, where the inner membrane of the autophagic vesicle and its content
  are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Reduced signaling from MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways
  on autophagy initiation is represented with dashed arrows. Black arrow and red blunt
  arrows represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. Figure created
