caption: An example of a pipeline from discovery research through to a therapeutic
  with clear clinical outcomes. The existence of a hormone that regulated platelet
  production was first proposed in 1958, but was not purified until 1994. In the intervening
  years, dedicated discovery research was able to define the cellular pathway by which
  platelets were produced in the bone marrow by megakaryocytes, with careful cell
  culture and microscopy, protein purification techniques, and animal models of thrombocytopenia.
  Decades of work demonstrated that megakaryocytes respond to thrombocytopenia by
  increasing their number, size, and DNA ploidy, and from this fundamental research
  platform, the TPO mimetics were created, tested, and released for clinical use.
