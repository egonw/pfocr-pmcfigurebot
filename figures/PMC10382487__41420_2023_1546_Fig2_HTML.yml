figure_title: Liver fibrosis factors stimulation promoted the senescence of UC-MSCs
caption: 'A Left panel: Cytochemical evaluation of the senescence marker senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase activity in UC-MSCs or UC-MSCs + LF for 6 h or UC-MSCs +LF for 12 h.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. Right panel: Quantification of SA-β-gal-positive cells in the
  left panel. B Quantification of cell viability detected by CCK8 kit. C QPCR analysis
  of several genes related to senescent markers in control and LF-treated UC-MSCs.
  D Immunoblotting analysis of p16 and p21 expression in control and LF-treated UC-MSCs.
  E Gene expressions of SASP marker expressions, including IL1A, IL6, CCL2, and TIMP2,
  in UC-MSCs with different treatments. F Immunoblotting analysis of JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway activation level in control and LF-treated UC-MSCs. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
