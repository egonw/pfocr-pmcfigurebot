caption: Electric fields shift the most thermodynamically favorable reaction mechanism.
  (a) Energy diagram of ammonia synthesis over Ru(0001) under different electric fields;
  the straight line represents the dissociative pathway (N2* ↔ 2N*), while the straight
  line with a square represents the associative pathway (N2* + H* ↔ N2H*); (b) positive
  fields favor the associative pathway (N2* + H* ↔ N2H*) by avoiding kinetically unfavorable
  strong initial N≡N bond dissociation over Ru(1013); (c) over 0.63 V/Å, the most
  favorable reaction path will change from N2 dissociation to N2H formation over Ru(1013).
  (d) Activation barrier of NH3 formation from NH2 hydrogenation over Ru(1013) under
  different electric fields. The inserted pictures are the structures of the initial
  state (IS), transition state (TS), and final state (FS); (e) forward and backward
  rate constants for NH2* + H* ↔ NH3* over Ru(1013) under different electric fields
  at 473 K; and (f) correlations between the dipole moment differences (Δμ = μFS –
  μIS) of an elementary reaction and its equilibrium constant under electric fields
  at 473 K. Asterisk (*) represents the empty surface site.
