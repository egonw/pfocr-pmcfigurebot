caption: Effects of RS treatment on the MALAT1 level and proliferative activity of
  the GC cells. The human GC cell line SGC7901 was treated with different concentrations
  of RS [0 (Control), 1, 5 ÂµM] for 24 hours. (A) The level of MALAT1 was measured
  by qRT-PCR; (B) Cell proliferation activity was measured by the CCK-8 method. Compared
  to the control group, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. RS, Resveratrol; MALAT1, metastasis-associated
  lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; GC, gastric cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit 8;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR.
article_title: Resveratrol inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration, and
  induces the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through the MALAT1/miR-383-5p/DDIT4
  signaling pathway.
