caption: Stable isotope tracing in Par-C5 shδ110 cells with U-13C glucose. Par-C5
  cells were starved of glucose for 18 h and then labeled with complete media substituted
  with labeled [U-13C]glucose for 0, 1, and 6 h. A, schematic showing glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and TCA cycle metabolites following addition of
  labeled glucose. Top legend indicates labels for 13C (red circle) or 12C (white
  circle) in glycolysis, TCA, and PPP schematic. Multi-colored legend (boxes) shows
  13C isotopologs for all tracing graphs. B, 13C enrichment in nucleotides; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
