caption: Part of the regulation pathway of lesion mimic genes in rice. (The regulatory
  pathways involved in rice lesion mimic genes mainly include lipid metabolism and
  chlorophyll synthesis metabolism in plants, transcription pathways of plant cell
  death, defense pathways of plants, intercellular transport pathways, and ROS signal
  transduction pathways).
