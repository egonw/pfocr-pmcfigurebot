caption: SEMA6D regulated the expression level of COL2A1 via p38 signaling pathway
  determined by immunofluorescence staining. Down-regulation of SEMA6D led to the
  lower fluorescence intensity that is the reduced expression of COL2A1, while up-regulation
  of SEMA6D displayed the opposite effect.
