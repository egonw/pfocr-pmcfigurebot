caption: Subperiosteal injection of DA improved the microstructural parameters of
  trabecular bone on the tension side (red-marked regions). (a) Diagram illustrating
  the rat model of orthodontic tooth movement. (b) Illustration of the drug injection
  protocol and the timing of dopamine (DA) administration. (c) 2D micro-CT images
  and 3D reconstructions of maxillary specimens at days 7 and 14 post-orthodontic
  force application. (d) Detailed three-dimensional reconstruction of trabecular bone
  structure within the region of interest (ROI) at days 7 and 14 after DA injection.
  (e–g) Quantitative microstructural analysis of trabecular bone parameters, including
  bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume (BV), and the ratio of bone volume to tissue
  volume (BV/TV) at days 7 and 14 post-DA injection, showing significant enhancements
  in the dopamine-treated group. (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001;
  Scale bar = 1 mm).
