caption: 'Quantitative proteomic profiling and bioinformatic analysis of colorectal
  cancer. A: Partial least squares-discriminant analysis of colorectal cancer and
  normal tissues; B: The volcano plot shows 1115 upregulated and 705 downregulated
  proteins in tumors; C: Gene ontology analysis shows that differentially expressed
  proteins are involved in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular
  functions; D: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis shows that differentially
  expressed proteins are significantly enriched in multiple pathways including ribosome
  biogenesis in eukaryotes, focal adhesion, cell cycle and extracellular matrix-receptor
  interaction; E and F: Gene set enrichment analysis shows that differentially expressed
  proteins are enriched in the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. PLS-DA: Partial
  least squares-discriminant analysis; CRC: Colorectal cancer tissue; CN: Normal colon
  tissue; GO: Gene ontology; KEGG: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; ECM: Extracellular
  matrix; NES: Normalized enrichment score.'
