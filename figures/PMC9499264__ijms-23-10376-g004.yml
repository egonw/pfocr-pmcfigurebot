caption: Heatmap showing the fold-change values in the 14 target genes analyzed in
  leaves at 21 and 60 DAS in response to the eight different treatments in wheat (A)
  and maize (B). For each gene, the corresponding pathway is indicated. Each row represents
  a gene and each column represents a treatment. Red and green correspond, respectively,
  to low and high expression levels. All values were normalized with respect to the
  control, which is therefore not shown.
