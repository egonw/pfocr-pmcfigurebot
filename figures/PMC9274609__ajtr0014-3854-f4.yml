caption: 'Expression of PIIIP in lung tissues in LPS-induced lung injury mice. A:
  Expression of PIIIP in lung tissues in different groups of mice; B: PIIIP IHC score;
  PIIIP reflected the level of fibrosis in lung tissues and it was highly expressed
  in Model and N-NBD groups (Red arrow presented positive staining). Each bar represents
  the mean ± SD of PIIIP IHC score in each group. *P<0.05 compared with Control. #P<0.05
  compared with Model. &P<0.05 compared with N-NBD. %P<0.05 compared with L-NBD.'
