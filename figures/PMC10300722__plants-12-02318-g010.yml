caption: 'Enrichment for photosynthetic processes in input datasets ((A)—antenna proteins;
  (B)—electron transport chain). A solid line presents a chemical reaction controlled
  by one or more enzyme. A dot line indicates adjacent metabolic pathway. Each Uniprot
  entry is divided by four squares, each representing a log2FC for a comparison between
  contaminated and reference plots, from left to right: K × B, K × L, M × B, M × L.
  The top line of the Uniprot entry is transcriptomic input, and bottom part is proteomic.
  The blue colour of a square reflects downregulation, and red—upregulation. If a
  biological feature is significant for any of the omics data layers, it is highlighted
  by a thicker border and a red mark at the top right corner. A single databox can
  represent one or more biological features, where only the entry of the most significant
  feature will be shown. In this case, a green mark in the bottom right corner indicates
  one or more hidden features that share functions or contribute equally to the biological
  process. The metabolomic data can be seen as red or blue spots in the white circles,
  where usually red means upregulation, and blue—downregulation. For more detailed
  data, please refer to . The figure was created with PaintOmics 4.'
