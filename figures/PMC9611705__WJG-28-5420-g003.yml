caption: 'Centromere protein K functions in colon cancer by regulating the expression
  of related genes. A: Trend of molecules in the experimental results in the classical
  pathway; B: Upstream regulator network diagram (the orange line indicates consistent
  activation of upstream regulators and genes, the blue line indicates consistent
  upstream regulators and gene inhibition, the yellow line indicates inconsistent
  expression trends between upstream regulators and genes, and the gray line indicates
  that there is no prediction information related to the expression state in the dataset);
  C: Analysis and statistics of disease and functional enrichment (the transverse
  coordinate is the path name and the longitudinal coordinate is significance level
  of enrichment (negative logarithmic transformation in the bottom 10); D: Disease
  and functional heatmap of the effect of disease and functional changes at gene expression
  levels; E: Activation and inhibition relationship between genes and disease or function;
  F: Interplay between genes and regulators and function in the dataset; G: Network
  of interaction relationships between molecules of a disease or function-related
  relationship. TGF-Î²: Transforming growth factor beta; FOXO: Forkhead box O; SMAD:
