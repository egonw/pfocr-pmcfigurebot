caption: 'MDK knockdown suppresses GBM growth through the Notch1/p-JNK pathway. LN229
  and LN229-shMDK (1×107) cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, and intraperitoneal
  injection of TMZ (1 mg/d/20 g, once a day, lasting 4 days, 2 rounds) was administered
  after the tumor volume reached 60-80 mm3. A. At the experimental end point, xenografts
  were dissected and photographed. B. Tumor volume was measured every 3 days. C. Tumor
  weight was measured at the experimental end point. D. Representative images of IHC
  staining of tumor tissues from 40 clinical patients. E. The expression differences
  of MDK, Notch1, p-JNK and CD133 between high- and low-grade gliomas were analyzed
  from the IHC data. F. The correlations among MDK, Notch1, p-JNK and CD133 were analyzed
  by Kendall’s tau tests. The n (number of independent tissue samples) and p value
  (two sided) are indicated. Scale bar: 100 μm, *: p<0.05, ***: p<0.001. G. Schematic
  diagram of MDK’s role in regulating stem-like properties through the Notch1/p-JNK
  signaling pathway and further promoting TMZ resistance in GBM.'
