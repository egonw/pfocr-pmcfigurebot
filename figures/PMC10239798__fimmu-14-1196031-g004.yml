caption: DCP1A activates the type I IFN signaling pathway. (A) ST, HEK-293T, and Vero-E6
  cells were transfected with 2 µg/well empty vector or pXJ40-HA-sDCP1A, pXJ40-HA-hDCP1A,
  and pXJ40-HA-mDCP1A expression plasmids. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were
  infected with VSV-GFP for 12 h, and the expression of DCP1A was examined by Western
  blotting with an anti-HA antibody. Then, the replication of VSV-GFP was analysed
  via fluorescence microscopy. (B) HEK-293T cells were transfected with pXJ40-HA vector
  and various amounts of the pXJ40-HA-mDCP1A expression plasmid. (C) pXJ40-HA vector,
  pXJ40-HA-h-DCP1A expression plasmid, DCP1A siRNA and negative control siRNA were
  transfected into HEK-293T cells. After 30 h, cells were collected for Western blot
  analysis. Cells were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-STAT2, anti-phospho
  STAT2, anti-STAT1, anti-phospho STAT1, anti-IRF3, anti-phospho IRF3, anti-P65, anti-phospho
  P65, anti-HA, and β-actin antibodies. (D) pXJ40-HA vector, pXJ40-HA-h-DCP1A expression
  plasmid, DCP1A siRNA and negative control siRNA were transfected into HEK-293T cells.
  After 30 h, IFN-β mRNA levels were analysed by RT−qPCR. All data are reported as
  mean±SD. For all experiments, *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 were considered to be statistically
  significant.
