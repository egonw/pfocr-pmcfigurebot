caption: Directionality test results for pathway methylation changes induced by TNFi.
  Profile plot showing the percentage of CpGs having opposite methylation changes
  between disease development (i.e. RA vs controls) and the response to TNFi (i.e.
  week12 vs baseline) for the pathways linked with RA. The top 40 pathways showing
  the strongest significant statistical evidence are included in the plot. These results
  confirm the effect of blood methylation variation induced by TNFi, clearly reversing
  it towards that of healthy individuals.

  of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.
