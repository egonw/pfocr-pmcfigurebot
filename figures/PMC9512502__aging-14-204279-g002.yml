caption: 'Ectopic expression of RON reverses the reduction of CXCR4 and the inhibition
  of cell migration and invasion by siCXCR4. After BIU87cells were transfected with
  siCXCR4 in the absence(-) or presence(+) of GV230/RON, wound healing assay for analysis
  of the cell migration (A, B), transwell invasion assay analysis of the cell invasion
  (C, D) and Western blot analysis of CXCR4, RON, E-cadherin and Vimentin expression
  (E). After down-regulation of CXCR4 with siCXCR4, the CXCR4 expression was significantly
  reduced, cell migration and invasion were also inhibited. However, overexpression
  of CXCR4 in BIU87 cells co-transfected with GV230/RON reversed CXCR4-reduced protein
  levels, cell migration and invasion. Data are shown as mean Â± SEM from one of three
  experiments with similar results. *P < 0.05, versus absence of GV230/RON and siCXCR4
  treatment, #P < 0.05, versus siCXCR4 treatment.'
