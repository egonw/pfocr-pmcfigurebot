caption: 'G3BP1 was an oncogenetic factor in NPC cells. (A and B) The effect of G3BP1
  on cell proliferation was determined by CCK8 and clone formation in HNE2 and HONE1
  cells respectively. Note: (1) siNC (control group), (2) siG3BP1-1, (3) siG3BP1-2,
  (4) Vector (control group), (5) Overexpression of G3BP1. (C) Knockdown of G3BP1
  significantly increased the apoptosis rate, and overexpression of G3BP1 decreased
  the apoptosis rate in front of the starvation induction. (D) Cell cycle was arrested
  at G0/G1 phase under the condition of knocking-down of G3BP1 in HNE2 cells, and
  overexpression of G3BP1 promoted G0/G1 progression in HONE1 cells. (E) HNE2 cells
  with G3BP1 knock-down showed significantly lower migration rates, and HONE1 cells
  with G3BP1 overexpression showed significantly higher migration rates by wound healing
  assay. (F) HNE2 cells with G3BP1 knockdown showed significantly lower invasion rates
  in matrigel invasion assay compared with control cells. Overexpression of G3BP1
  significantly increased invasion rates in matrigel invasion assay of HONE1 cells.
  (G) The number of spherical clones of invasive cells and prominent protrusions at
  the edges of the cells were significantly reduced with knocking-down of G3BP1 by
  three-dimensional invasion assay. Note: (1) siNC (control group), (2) siG3BP1-1,
  (3) siG3BP1-2.'
