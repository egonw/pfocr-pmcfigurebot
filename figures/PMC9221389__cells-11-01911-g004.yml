caption: Enrichment analysis of DEGs at each time point in scRNA-seq data. (A) Circle
  diagram of the biological process analysis of significant DEGs on day 1 post-MI
  and (B) for day 3 post-MI, (C) for day 7 post-MI. Different colored blocks represent
  different biological processes. The yellow band in the outermost circle indicates
  autophagy-related BPs, and the green band indicates apoptosis-related BPs. (D) Bar
  chart of the KEGG analysis of significant DEGs on day 1 post-MI and (E) for day
  3 post-MI, (F) for day 7 post-MI. Only the first 25 pathways are shown in the figure,
  and the p cut-off value of all pathways is 0.05.
