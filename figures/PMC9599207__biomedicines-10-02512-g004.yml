caption: The expression of YAP1 and TAZ in the GC microenvironment. By scRNA-seq analysis,
  YAP1 was predominantly expressed in cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts,
  and endothelial cells, while the immune cells (T and B cells) demonstrated less
  YAP1/TAZ expression. TAZ expression was diffusely distributed in the different cell
  types, with slightly higher expression in T cells.
