caption: The violin plots of the key pathway activity profiles across the mouse normal
  esophageal tissues and the esophageal tumors. The violin plots between the normal
  and cancer tissues represent the changes of the pathway activity profiles of multiple
  mitochondrial complex assemblies and metabolic and molecular pathways that were
  significantly changed in the G‐MDSC cells of mouse esophageal tumors compared with
  the normal esophageal tissues.
