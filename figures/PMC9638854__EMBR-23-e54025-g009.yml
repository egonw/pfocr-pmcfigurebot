figure_title: Upregulation of Hh pathway activity with Ptc  RNAi  increases proliferation
  in both anterior and posterior compartments
caption: A–F Control (apGal ts  > WT, A–C) or apGal ts  > Ptc RNAi  (D–F) wing pouch
  stained for Ptc (A, D), Ci (B, E) or the mitotic marker phospho‐histone H3 (PH3,
  C, F).G Schematic of wing disc sub‐compartments. V = Ventral, D = Dorsal, A = Anterior,
  P = Posterior.H Quantification of PH3‐positive nuclei in the dorsal (D) and ventral
  (V) compartments of the pouch of control (Ctrl, apGal ts  > WT, n = 5) and apGal
  ts  > Ptc RNAi  (n = 6) wing discs. *P‐value < 0.05, **P‐value < 0.01 using, ns = not
  significant P‐value using either paired t‐tests between disc compartments belonging
  to the same group (apGal ts  > Ptc RNAi  or control) or Mann–Whitney tests for different
  groups (Ctrl_D vs. Dorsal, Ctrl_V vs. Ventral). The frequency distributions of the
  data are shown with violin plots, with the thick black horizontal line indicating
  the median and the thinner lines indicating the quartiles.I Quantification of mitotic
  density in different compartments of the pouch in control (Ctrl, ap > WT) and apGal
  ts  > Ptc RNAi  wing discs. *P‐value < 0.05, **P‐value < 0.01 using, ns = not significant
  P‐value using one‐way ANOVA tests with Bonferroni post hoc correction.
