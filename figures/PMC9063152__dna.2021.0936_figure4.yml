caption: Tregs promote chemoresistance through the IL-10/STAT3/BCL2 signaling pathway.
  (A) Workflow of organoid cultures from gastric cancer tissues from patients. (B,
  C) Microphotographs of gastric cancer organoids in the indicated groups on days
  1, 3, and 9. The area of the organoid area was calculated. (D) Colony formation
  analysis of gastric cancer organoids in the indicated groups on day 9. (E) The relationship
  between patient overall survival and STAT3 expression from TCGA dataset was analyzed.
  (F) The relationship between patient overall survival and FOXP3 expression from
  TCGA dataset was analyzed. (G) The relationship between patient overall survival
  and IL-10 expression from TCGA dataset was analyzed. Data are presented as means ± SD
  of three independent experiments.
