caption: ROCK1 promotes LSCC cells growth. A The ROCK1 level was reduced in TU686/si-ROCK1
  cells. B The knockdown effect was verified by Western Blot. ROCK1 was significantly
  decreased in TU686/si-ROCK1 and TU212/si-ROCK1 cells. C Plasmid transfection was
  used to upregulate the expression level of ROCK1 in TU686 and TU212 cells, the effect
  of transfection was verified via IF. D The expression level of ROCK1 was verified
  by Western Blot. ROCK1 was significantly increased in TU686/ROCK1 and TU212/ROCK1
  cells. E, F. ROCK1 knockdown reduced cell proliferation (*P < 0.05). G, H Overexpression
  of ROCK1 increased cell proliferation (*P < 0.05). I, J ROCK1 knockdown induced
  cell apoptosis (**P < 0.01). K, L Overexpression of ROCK1 promoted cell proliferation
  (**P < 0.01)
