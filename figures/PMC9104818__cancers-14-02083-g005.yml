caption: Regulation of the lipidic signature by the bone’s transcriptome and secretome.
  Mech-anistic model by which dysregulations in the bone cells’ transcriptome and
  secretome under co-culture with PC3 cells may be regulating the expression/activity
  of the tumor-associated PKA gene, a potential driver of the lipid-associated signature,
  which in turn increases the expression of SLC16A1, VDR, GPX1, PPARA and PAPSS2,
  thus shaping the metabolic phenotype of metastatic PCa. Networks from the Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the transcriptomes of MC3T3 (pre-osteoblasts) or Raw264.7
  (pre-osteoclasts) cells co-cultured with PC3 (upper panel). Bone proteins identified
  by mass spectrometry of the conditioned media (CM) of MC3T3 or Raw264.7 cells co-cultured
  with PC3 cells (medium panel). Enriched network from the IPA of genes dysregulated
  in PC3 co-cultured with MC3T3 and Raw264.7 cells (lower panel). Upregulated genes
  (red), downregulated genes (light blue), upstream regulators (pink), proteins secreted
  by osteoblasts (purple), proteins secreted by osteo-clasts (light green), proteins
  secreted by osteoblasts and osteoclasts (green), molecules proposed by the IPA (gray).
