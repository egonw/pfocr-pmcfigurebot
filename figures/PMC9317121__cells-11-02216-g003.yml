caption: Bmp-2 expression during mouse tooth development. At the cap stage (E15) of
  mouse tooth development, Bmp-2 mRNA was highly expressed in the dental epithelium
  and moderately detectable in dental mesenchymal cells, osteogenetic mesenchyme,
  and Meckel’s cartilage. At the early bell stage (E16), the Bmp-2 transcript was
  present in ameloblasts, odontoblasts, dental pulp cells, dental follicles, and mesenchyme
  in the alveolar bone. At postnatal days ranging from 1 to 14, an in situ hybridization
  signal was apparent in odontoblasts, dental pulp cells, and osteoblasts in the alveolar
  bone and was weakly detected in ameloblasts. The figure is adapted with permission
