caption: '(Aâ€“C) Box plots of the enriched pathways predicted by gene expression values
  on nSolver software analysis of the specific pathway up-regulated in the transfected
  cells with miR-130a-3p. (D) Bar charts report the most relevant functional annotations
  obtained by DAVID Bioinformatics tool using the overexpressed (red bar) and down-modulated
  (blue bar) genes in miR-130a-3p transfected cells versus NC. The lists were sorted
  by log-false discovery rate (logFDR) values. BP: Biological Process; MF: Molecular
  Function; CC: Cellular Component.'
