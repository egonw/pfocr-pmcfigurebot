figure_title: The in vivo synthesis of Caf1 by the chaperone-usher pathway. Step 1.
  The Caf1 protein (in blue) is secreted in its unfolded form into the periplasm.
  Step 2. The Caf1 protein folds upon its complexation with a Caf1M chaperone (in
  yellow) to afford (Step 3) a stable Caf1M : Caf1 complex, which is delivered to
  the usher protein. Steps 4 & 5. The donor strand of this complex displaces the chaperone
  from the Caf1 subunit located at the terminus of the growing Caf1 oligomer. This
  process, termed donor strand exchange (DSE), is mediated by the pore-shaped usher
  protein (Caf1A). Step 6. The growing Caf1 oligomer is now one subunit longer, and
  the displaced Caf1M becomes available to complex with another unfolded Caf1 subunit
