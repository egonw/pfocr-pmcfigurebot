caption: 'Aging/aged C57BL/6 mouse lenses or hLECs exhibited a significant reduction
  in phospholipase A2, GSH peroxidase, Catalase and SOD activities. (A–D) Total protein
  was isolated from different ages of mouse lenses and processed for analyses of the
  enzymatic activities. Increasing decline of aiPLA2 (A), GSH peroxidase (B), Catalase
  (C) and SOD (D) activities were observed in lenses with aging. Data represents the
  mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Younger (6 M) vs. aging (14 M and
  22 M) samples. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001. (E–H) Primary hLECs isolated from lenses
  of different ages were divided into three groups: 17–25 y (n = 8); 53–59 y (n =
  10) and 65–78 y (n = 10). Total protein was isolated from hLECs of different ages
  as indicated in figures and was processed for estimating their enzymatic activities.
  The data represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Younger (17–25
  y) vs. aging (53–59 y and 65–78 y) samples. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.'
