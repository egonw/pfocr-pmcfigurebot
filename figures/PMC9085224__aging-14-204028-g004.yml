caption: The MAP2K1 (MEK1) gene and ERK-MMP pathway were implicated in ESCC progression.
  Gene expression profiles in combination with gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway
  analysis was performed; (A) The results of the Go pathways from the data in GSE161533
  dataset; (B) the results of the Go pathways from the data in GSE17351; (C) partial
  results of the KEGG pathways from the data in GSE17351; (D and E) the activation
  of matrix metalloproteinases signaling pathway and ERK signaling pathway were enriched
  in ESCC and appeared to be strongly correlated to with MEK1.
