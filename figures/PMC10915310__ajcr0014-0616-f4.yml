caption: ELF1 interferes with cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting DCLK1.
  The ELF1 overexpression plasmid and si-DCLK1 were co-transfected into Capan-2 cells,
  and the si-ELF1 and DCLC1 overexpression plasmids were co-transfected into PANC-1
  cells. A. DCLK1 mRNA expression was probed by qRT-PCR after transfection. B, C.
  The viability of Capan-2 and PANC-1 cells was detected by CCK-8 and EdU assays.
  D. The apoptosis of Capan-2 and PANC-1 cells was detected by flow cytometry. *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

  cancer by regulating doublecortin-like kinase 1/Janus kinase/signal transducer and
  activator of transcription pathway.
