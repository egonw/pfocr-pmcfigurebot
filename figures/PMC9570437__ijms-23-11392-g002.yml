caption: Schematic showing some of the proposed mechanisms underpinning CTD specific
  and location specific downstream consequences of acute excitotoxicity. At synaptic
  sites activation of GluN2A containing NMDARs (green) promotes expression of CREB
  and pro-survival genes and inhibits the PTEN pathway shut-off of pro-survival genes.
  Synaptic GluN2B containing NMDARs (yellow) may mediate pro-survival or pro-death
  signalling depending on the level of glutamate. When faced with excitotoxic glutamate
  levels preferential GluN2B/PSD95/nNOS coupling promotes NO mediated shut off of
  CREB, oxidative stress and subsequent cell death. Direct coupling of CTD2B to mitochondrial
  proteins may also facilitate Ca2+ overload and mitochondrial dysfunction (potential
  but unconfirmed pathway; ?). At extrasynaptic sites physical and functional coupling
  of both CTD2A and CTD2B with TRPM2 and 4 may result in enhanced extrasynaptic NMDAR
  activity to promote cell death. Therefore, it is possible that a hierarchy exists
  in which a combination of both composition and location determines the downstream
  consequences of NMDARs.
