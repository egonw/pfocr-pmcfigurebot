caption: 'Estimation of septal patch location based on a voltage map and effective
  ablation sites. The septal patch edge is drawn with white dotted lines. A: A voltage
  map of pulmonary venous atrium (PVA) from left anterior oblique view shows that
  the entrance of excitation propagation from systemic venous atrium (SVA) to PVA
  is located on the upper edge of the patch (white waved arrow). B: A voltage map
  of SVA from right lateral view. The patch was sutured just below the superior vena
  cava (SVC) with its posterior edge adjacent to the right superior pulmonary vein
  (RSPV). C: A voltage map of SVA from right anterior oblique view shows that a propagation
  entrance from PVA to SVA is located on the lower edge of the patch that faced PVA
  (white waved arrow). D: Biatrial activation map from right anterior oblique view
  shows the successful ablation site in PVA with an orange tag. After effective ablation
  to the earliest site of SVA (red cross mark) resulted in tachycardia cycle length
  prolongation by 60 ms, the entrance was estimated to have changed from the lower
  edge to the anterior edge of the patch, which is an alternative pathway (red dotted
  arrow), because the success site of PVA was located anterior to the original earliest
  site of SVA 2 centimeters apart. Abbreviations and the descriptions of pink and
  orange tags are as in . The voltage cut-off level was between 0.1 and 0.5 mV.'
