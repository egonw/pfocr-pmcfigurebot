caption: 'Pathway diagram for pathogen spill-over to humans from animals describes
  three distinct processes. (1) Zoonoses: pathogens that are transmitted from an animal
  reservoir directly or indirectly (e.g., foodborne, vector-borne, etc.) to humans,
  causing disease; (2) Emerging infectious diseases: pathogens that cause an emergent
  infectious disease in humans and persist in human populations irrespective of an
  animal reservoir. Genetic origins may show links to non-human animals, but these
  diseases undergo a more complex process of evolution not necessarily dependent on
  a specific animal reservoir, and usually evolve to be independent of animals; (3)
  Zooanthroponosis: reverse zoonosis whereby humans transmit infection to animals.
