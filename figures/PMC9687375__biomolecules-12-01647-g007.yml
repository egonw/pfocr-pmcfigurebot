caption: 'The combination of curcumin and BTZ synergistically enhances the effect
  on MM apoptosis by regulating multiple signaling pathways. Curcumin+BTZ synergistically
  enhanced apoptosis through potent inhibition of IL-6-induced JNK/STAT and MAPK/ERK,
  as well as NF-κB. Additional inhibition of the Notch1 signaling pathway by curcumin
  increased the expression of caspase3 protein and PARP and therefore enhanced apoptosis.
  Abbreviations: BTZ: bortezomib; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-kappa-B; MAPK/ERK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases; MM: Multiple myeloma; Notch1:
  Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1; JAK/STAT: Janus kinases/signal transducer
  and activator of transcription proteins; PARP: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.'
