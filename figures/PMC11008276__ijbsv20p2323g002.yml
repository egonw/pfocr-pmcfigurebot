caption: H. pylori / MNNG induce IL-33 expression via ROS-STAT3 signaling pathway.
  (A) IL-33 mRNA expression in GES-1 cells stimulated with 1X104H. pylori or 50 μM
  MNNG for 12 h. (B) IL-33 protein level in GES-1 cells treated as in A for 24 h.
  (C) ROS level in GES-1 cells treated as in A for 3 h. (D) IL-33 mRNA expression
  in GES-1 cells stimulated as in A in the presence or absence of 20μM ROS inhibitor
  (NAC) for 12 h. (E) Protein expression of IL-33 in GES-1 cells treated as in D for
  24 h. (F) IL-33 promoter activity in GES-1 cells treated as in D. (G) IL-33 mRNA
  expression in GES-1 cells stimulated with 1X104 H.pylori or 50 μM MNNG for 12 h
  with inhibitors targeting p53 (Pifithrin-α HBr, 10 μM), HIF1α (2-MeOE2, 10 μM),
  NRF2 (ML385, 10 μM), AP1 (SR11302, 10 μM), NF-κB (BAY 11, 10 μM), PPARγ (GW9662,
  10 μM), c-Jun (IQ3, 10 μM), STAT3 (STAT3-IN-7, 10 μM), β-catenin (FH535, 10 μM).
  (H) Immunoblot of p-STAT3 in GES-1 cells stimulated as in A for 6 h. (I) Cyto-immunofluorescence
  of p-STAT3 in GES-1 cells treated as in H for 6 h. Scale bar represents 100μm. (J)
  IL-33 promoter activity in H. pylori or MNNG-stimulated GES-1 cells with Stat3 knockdown
  by siRNA. (K) IL-33 promoter activity in H. pylori or MNNG-stimulated GES-1 cells
  with or without STAT3 inhibitor. (L) IL-33 mRNA in GES-1 cells treated as in J for
  12 h. (M) IL-33 mRNA expression in GES-1 cells treated as in K for 12 h. (N) Immunoblot
  of IL-33 in GES-1 cells treated as in J for 24 h. (O) Immunoblot of IL-33 in GES-1
  cells treated as in K for 24 h. *p <0.05, **p <0.01 , ***p <0.001 and ****p <0.0001.
  Data are means±s.e.m. and representative of three independent experiments.
