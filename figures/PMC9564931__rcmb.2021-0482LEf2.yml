caption: Proteins that explain the majority of variance between exposure conditions.
  (A) Maximally variant proteins revealed the only promiscuous condition to be PGVG
  with Air. (B) Pathway analysis revealed phenotypic outcomes of extracellular, immune
  system, protein degradation, asthma, and cell cycle. (C.i–C.iv) Protein iBAQ rank
  plots of (C.i) Air, (C.ii) PGVG, (C.iii) PGVG + Nic, and (C.iv) Smoke. Log2-fold
  changes reveal major differences between expression profiles. (D.i and D.ii) Murine
  proteins converted to human and compared with curated (D.i) idiopathic pulmonary
  fibrosis (IPF) and (D.ii) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) databases.
  (D.i) PGVG showed 2.01% overlap of upregulated proteins when compared with upregulated
  IPF biomarkers. PGVG + Nic showed 27.78% overlap of downregulated proteins when
  compared with IPF biomarkers. (D.ii) PGVG showed a 5.38% overlap of upregulated
  proteins with COPD biomarkers. PGVG + Nic showed a 1.33% overlap of upregulated
  proteins with COPD biomarkers and 39.02% overlap with downregulated COPD protein
  biomarkers.
