caption: Overview of PPARα activation and regulation. PPARα activity is mediated by
  intra/extra-cellular metabolic signaling. Fasting induces elevation of fatty acids,
  the insulin signaling pathway, elevation of blood glucose, and glucagon which may
  stimulate expression and/or activity of PPARα under physiological metabolic conditions
  leading to increased lipid consumption.
