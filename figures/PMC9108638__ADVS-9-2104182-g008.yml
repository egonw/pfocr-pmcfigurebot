caption: 'A) Schematic illustration of the in vivo experimental design. B) Primary
  tumor growth curves from individual 4T1 tumor‐bearing BALB/c mice in different treatment
  groups. C) Primary tumor growth curves with mean tumor volumes from 4T1 tumor‐bearing
  BALB/c mice (n = 6 biologically independent mice). The D) individual and E) averaged
  4T1 tumor growth curves of distant tumors after different treatments (n = 6 biologically
  independent mice). F) Body weights of 4T1 tumor mice treated with different formulations
  (n = 6 biologically independent mice). G) Representative images of H&E stained lungs
  from different groups showing tumor metastasis. The black arrows refer to tumor
  nodules. Scale bar: 1000 µm. H) Number of pulmonary nodules after different treatments.
  Data are statistically compared to the PPDAIn PTT treatment group (n = 5 biologically
  independent mice). Data are expressed as the means ± SD. Statistical significance
  is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 and ns represents
  no significant difference.'
