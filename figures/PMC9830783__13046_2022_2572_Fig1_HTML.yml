caption: Parvimonas micra promotes cancer cell proliferation. A–C Detection of P.
  micra promoting cancer cell line proliferation through cell counting, MTT assay,
  and real-time cell analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from 3 independent
  experiments. D–G LoVo cells treated with Pm-42, DH5α, or PBS were subcutaneously
  injected into male BALB/C nude mice to produce xenograft tumors in animals. Data
  are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 5. D Images of xenograft mice. E The change of tumor
  size in xenograft mice. F The weight of tumor in xenograft mice. G The detection
  of 17 cytokines in the sera of xenograft mice
article_title: Parvimonas micra activates the Ras/ERK/c-Fos pathway by upregulating
  miR-218-5p to promote colorectal cancer progression.
