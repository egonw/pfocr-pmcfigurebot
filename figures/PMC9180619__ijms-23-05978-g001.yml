caption: SHPK expression correlates with clinical characteristics and prognosis of
  GBM patients. (A) SHPK mRNA expression within healthy cerebral tissues and different
  brain tumor histologies. (B) SHPK mRNA expression of different WHO-grade brain tumors.
  (C) SHPK mRNA expression in the three different molecular subtypes of brain tumors.
  (D) SHPK protein expression of histological sections from normal and cancer tissues
  obtained by immunohistochemistry. (E) Survival analysis with Kaplan–Meier estimator
  and visualization of confidence intervals of GBM samples using the median of SHPK
  mRNA expression values as the cutoff. Hazard Ratio (HR) and p-values (Log-Rang and
  Wilcox) are also shown. Violin plot p-values were calculated using an unpaired nonparametric
  test, the two-tailed Mann–Whitney, with GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. **** p < 0.0001; ***
  p< 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05.
