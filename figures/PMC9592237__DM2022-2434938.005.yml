caption: 'RGS2 was miR-452-5p''s downstream target. (a) StarBase was utilized in the
  prediction of the miR-452-5p binding sites on RGS2. (b) Luciferase reporter experiment
  was conducted to assess the luciferase activities in the MDA-MB-2312 and HCC1937
  cells that had a combined transfection of RGS2-WT or RGS2-MUT reporter plasmid plus
  either a miR-452-5p mimic or miR-NC. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs mimic-NC. (c) RT-qPCR was utilized
  for measuring RGS2 expression in BC as well as adjacent tissues. ∗∗P < 0.001. (d)
  RT-qPCR was utilized for the determination of RGS2 expression in normal MCF-10A
  cells and BC cells (MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937). ∗∗P < 0.001 vs MCF-10A. (e) The association
  between miR-452-5p and RGS2 levels in BC tissues was ascertained by Pearson''s r.
  (f) Western blotting was utilized for measuring RGS2 protein expression in empty
  vector, mimic-NC, RGS2-OE (OE), mimic or OE+mimic transfected HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231
  cells. ∗∗P < 0.001 vs empty vector. ^^P < 0.001 vs mimic-NC. ##P < 0.001 vs OE+mimic.'
