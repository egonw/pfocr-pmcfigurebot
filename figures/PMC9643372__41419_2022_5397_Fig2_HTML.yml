figure_title: Myo1b promotes CRC angiogenesis by enhancing VEGF secretion of CRC cells
caption: A Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that VEGF pathway was positively
  enriched in patients harboring high Myo1b expression from GEO datasets (GSE14333).
  B RT-qPCR confirmed the efficiency of si-Myo1b as well as OE-Myo1b in CRC cells
  and detected the effects of Myo1b on the expression of multiple angiogenesis-related
  factors in HCT-116 and HT29 cells. The conditioned medium (CM) of CRC cells (HCT-116
  and HT29) with different Myo1b expression levels affected cell tube formation (C),
  migration (D & E) and proliferation (F) of HUVECs. G Blood vessels formed in representative
  images of the CAM assay after CM treatment. H The concentration of VEGF in the conditioned
  medium (CM) of HCT-116 and HT29 cells with different Myo1b expression levels was
  detected by ELISA assays. Each bar represented the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
