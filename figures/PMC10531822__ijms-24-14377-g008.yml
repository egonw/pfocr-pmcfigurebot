caption: Reshaped Wnt and Notch signaling expression in Piezo1ΔGC mouse colon crypts
  lead to reduced GCs. (A) Volcano plot depicting the differentially expressed genes
  between Piezo1-knockdown and Control LS174T cells (determined via RNA-Seq). The
  genes were selected via |Log2 (Fold Change)| > 1 and p-value < 0.05. The gray dots
  indicate genes with no significant difference between the two groups. (B) KEGG analysis
  of differentially expressed genes. The interested KEGG terms are marked in red.
  The threshold for significance was p-value < 0.05. (C,D) RNA levels of Wnt and Notch
  signaling pathway target genes in WT and Piezo1ΔGC mouse colon crypts (normalized
  to GAPDH). (E,F) RNA levels of Foxo and Hippo signaling pathway key genes in WT
  and Piezo1ΔGC mouse colon crypts (normalized to GAPDH). Data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM. (A, n = 3; C–F, n = 5 mice). ns, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p <
  0.01; *** p < 0.001.
