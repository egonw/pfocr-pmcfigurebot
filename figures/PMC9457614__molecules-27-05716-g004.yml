caption: 'Plumbagin suppressed HIF-1α at transcriptional and translational levels
  under CoCl2-induced hypoxic conditions in MCF-7 cells. (A) HIF-1α protein expression
  was analyzed by Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were treated with 0–4 μM of plumbagin
  for 24 h under hypoxic conditions induced by CoCl2. (B) The relative quantities
  of HIF-1α protein were quantified and normalized with β-actin. (C) Plumbagin downregulated
  HIF-1α gene expression. Data are means ± SEM from three independent experiments
  (n = 3). # p < 0.05 vs. normoxic, * p < 0.05 vs. mimic hypoxic group without treatment.'
