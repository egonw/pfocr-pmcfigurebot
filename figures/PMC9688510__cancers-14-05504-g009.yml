caption: Antioxidant response and UPR activation induced by IR in PC3RR and DU-145RR
  cells. (A) Endogenous ROS levels in parental PCa and PCaRR were measured with flow
  cytometry using DCFDA dye fluorescence. The graphs represent the fold expression
  of ROS levels, in which the median of fluorescence of parental PC3 or DU-145 cells
  is set as one. The values are from three independent experiments. Representative
  flow cytometry histograms are shown. (B) The mRNA levels of the indicated genes
  were quantified by qRT-PCR, and β-Actin was used as an internal control. To evaluate
  UPR pathway, Western blot analysis was performed on cell lysates from unirradiated
  cells (Ctrl) or cells irradiated with 4 Gy and collected 1, 3 and 6 h after IR in
  PC3/PC3RR (C) DU-145/DU-145RR (D). β-Actin or α-Tubulin were used as internal controls.
  Each blot is representative of three experiments. The histograms represent the densitometric
  analysis of three separate Western blots evaluated as arbitrary units (A.U.). Data
  represent the mean ± S.E.M. derived from at least three independent experiments.
  PC3RR vs. PC3 and DU-145RR vs. DU-145; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Student’s
  unpaired t-test.
