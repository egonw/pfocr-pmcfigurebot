figure_title: Reaction Pathway for the Synthesis of Pentoses from C6-Aldonates
caption: In the top frame is shown the hypothesis proposed by Larralde et al., in
  which a primitive enzyme can selectively oxidize C6-aldonates at the 3-position
  to produce 3-oxo-uronate(s) followed by β-decarboxylation to afford a mixture of
  pentoses. The nonenzymatic pathway proposed here is shown in the bottom frame and
  starts with a nonselective chemical oxidation of aldonates, yielding a mixture of
  2-oxo-, 4-oxo, 5-oxo-, and 6-oxo-uronate regioisomers. These newly formed uronates
  can undergo carbonyl migration to the 3-position, following β-decarboxylation to
  pentoses. The proposed pathway by Larralde et al. in  was reproduced with permission
  from ref (). 1995 United States National Academy of Sciences.
