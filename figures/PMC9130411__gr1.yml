caption: Profiling immune cell signatures from COVID-19 patients highlights increasing
  risk of severe disease associated with progression to active tuberculosisCOVID-19
  immune cell signatures were derived from bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)
  studies and used to generate putative “COVID-19 risk scores” from a tuberculosis
  (TB) whole blood bulk RNA-seq dataset using the TBSignatureProfiler package. TB
  samples are grouped according to disease state and COVID-19 signatures were categorized
  by immune cell or signature type. Scores for each signature were compared by contrasting
  each group with the ‘London Latent’ group using a t-test with Bonferroni correction.
  All signatures were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) unless
  otherwise stated in the boxplot title. Each individual signature title is prefixed
  by the first author of the study from which it was derived. Category colors relate
  to cell type, disease, pathway or study first author. WB, whole blood. M, macrophage.
  BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. ISG, interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. NK, natural
  killer. ICU, intensive care unit. BTM, blood transcriptional module. Boxplots denote
  median and 25th to 75th percentiles (boxes) and 10th to 90th percentiles (whiskers).
