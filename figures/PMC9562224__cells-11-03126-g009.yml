caption: 'CPP increased the protein levels of HEY1 in HDFs in vivo. (a) After two
  weeks of continuous intraperitoneal injection of mice with different concentrations
  of 1 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, of CPP and PBS, respectively, mouse dorsal skin
  was extracted, paraffin sections were performed, and the protein levels of HEY1
  and Vimentin were detected by immunofluorescence. White arrows indicate cells expressing
  both Vimentin and HEY1. Scale bars: 100μm. (b–d) ImageJ analysis of co-localization
  of Vimentin and HEY1.'
