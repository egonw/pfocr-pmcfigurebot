caption: Model of autoantibody feedback. B cell activation pathway bias in COVID‐19
  is dictated by early viral control. (Right) High‐inflammation microenvironments
  due to poor viral control drive EF‐biased responses that, while rapidly generating
  neutralizing Abs, can result in autoantibody production through relaxed tolerance
  enforcement. These autoantibodies may contribute to inflammation and tissue damage,
  potentially reenforcing EF‐biased response
