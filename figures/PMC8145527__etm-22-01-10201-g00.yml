caption: Regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs and the NF-κB signaling pathway in gastric
  cancer. (a) miRNAs regulate target genes to activate or inhibit the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The NF-κB signaling pathway is able to influence miRNA expression by regulating
  target genes. (b) miRNAs activate or inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway directly,
  and the NF-κB signaling pathway is also able to influence miRNA expression directly.
  (c) The NF-κB signaling pathway influences the development of gastric cancer by
  regulating downstream proteins. (d) The NF-κB signaling pathway may influence the
  development of gastric cancer directly. miRNA, microRNA; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
