caption: Coronary regrowth is inhibited by small molecules ex vivo. (A) Whole-mount
  view of coronary growth in deltaC:EGFP hearts with VEGF(R) signaling inhibitor ZM32388
  or vehicle ex vivo. n = 6–8. (B) Quantification of experiments in (A). Mann-Whitney
  Rank Sum test. (C) Whole-mount view of coronary growth in deltaC:EGFP hearts with
  EGF(R) signaling pathway inhibitor AG1478 or vehicle ex vivo. n = 6–8. (D) Quantification
  of experiments in (C). Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test. (E) Whole-mount view of coronary
  growth in deltaC:EGFP hearts with Notch signaling pathway inhibitor DAPT or LY411575
  ex vivo. n = 6–8. (F) Quantification of experiments in (E). Mann-Whitney Rank Sum
  test. All experiments were repeated once. Scale bars, 300 μm.
