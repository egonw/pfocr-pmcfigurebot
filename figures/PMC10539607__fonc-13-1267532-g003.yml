caption: Predicted modulation of gene networks by opioid agonists and antagonists.
  (A) Correlation of RNA expression of the turquoise network (y-axis) with the quantity
  of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) measured by histopathologic analysis
  (x-axis). Each point represents a patient in the FUSCC cohort. (B) Scaled opioid
  susceptibility metrics (OSM) (y-axis) for each gene network (x-axis) are presented.
  The OSM estimates how susceptible the RNA expression of each network is in response
  to the common downstream pathway of various opioid receptor modulators. Color of
  each bar corresponds to network name, labeled along the x-axis. Only those networks
  (N=23) with sufficient drug-induced RNA expression data for enrichment calculations
  are plotted.
