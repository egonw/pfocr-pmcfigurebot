caption: 'The oxidative stress response during neural differentiation is tightly coupled
  to developmental changes in proteostasis and NRF2-KEAP1 pathway modulation. (A)
  Schematic representation of alterations in OS-associated pathways across neural
  differentiation. (B) Schematic representation of the interaction between proteostasis
  (autophagy and proteasome) and the NRF2-KEAP1 pathway under physiological and acute
  OS conditions. Top panel: OS response control under functional proteostasis conditions.
  Bottom panel: OS response under dysfunctional proteostasis induced by proteasome
  inhibition.'
