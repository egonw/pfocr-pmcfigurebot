caption: 'Resveratrol (RSV) promotes autophagy in A549 cells. Cells were treated with
  various concentrations of RSV for 48 h. (A) MDC (50 μM) fluorescent staining was
  used to mark autophagosomes; (B) AO (1 μg/mL) staining of autophagic vesicles. Fluorescence
  intensity was determined by flow cytometry (APC); (C) Autophagosomes (marked by
  red arrow) and autolysosomes (marked by yellow arrow) observed under TEM; (D) Cells
  were infected by adenovirus mRFP-GFP-LC3. Autophagosomes (yellow puncta) and autolysosomes
  (red puncta) were observed under confocal microscope; (E) Transcriptional expression
  of BECLIN 1 and LC3B as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB was used as an internal control;
  (F) Protein expression of BECLIN 1, LC3 I, and LC3 II as determined by Western blot.
  ACTB was used as an internal control; (G) QRT-PCR analysis of mRNA level of BECLIN
  1 in the cells treated with or without 80 μM RSV or 5 mM 3-MA. ACTB was used as
  an internal control; (H) Western blot assay of protein level of BECLIN 1 in the
  cells treated with or without 80 μM RSV or 5 mM 3-MA. ACTB was used as an internal
  control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of triplicate tests. * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group. ## p < 0.01 compared with 80 μM
  RSV group.'
