caption: Metagenome inference of microbial pathways. A Screening prognosis-associated
  metagenome pathways using PICRUSt2. Wilcoxon test was performed to examine the distribution
  of microbial pathways. Differential TRFA was regarded as the effect size. B TRFA
  and taxonomic contribution of pathways enriched in the M5-low patients. C TRFA and
  taxonomic contribution of pathways depleted in the M5-low patients. D, E PFS curves
  by thiamine diphosphate salvage II pathway (PWY-6897) (D) and L-histidine degradation
  pathway (HISDEG-PWY) (E). F TRFA of the two significant microbial pathways by clinical
  stage and recurrence of CRC. G Spearmanâ€™s correlation between TRFA and the number
  of CD8+ T cells in the epithelium and its significance. The numbers at risk are
  presented under the survival curves
article_title: Enterotypical Prevotella and three novel bacterial biomarkers in preoperative
  stool predict the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer.
