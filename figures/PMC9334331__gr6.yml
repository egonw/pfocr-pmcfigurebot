caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs. (A) KEGG pathway classification of up-regulated
  DEGs. (B) KEGG enrichment TOP 20 analysis of up-regulated DEGs. (C) A heatmap of
  the genes involved in KEGG enrichment TOP 20 was constructed. The yellow highlighted
  genes are involved in RIG-I-like receptor signaling.
article_title: The substitution at residue 218 of the NS5 protein methyltransferase
  domain of Tembusu virus impairs viral replication and translation and may triggers
  RIG-I-like receptor signaling.
