caption: 'RB1 expression restricts the usage of alternate fuels. Seahorse XFp Mito-fuel
  flex assays to measure fuel dependency and flexibility in cells transduced with
  different vectors as indicated. (A) Oxidation of glucose as fuel in control and
  RB1-complemented WERI-Rb1 cells (n = 3). (B) Oxidation of glutamine as fuel (n =
  3). (C) Oxidation of fatty acids as fuel (n = 3). Validation of fuel oxidation profile
  in cells cultured in glucose and glutamine alone conditions and transduced with
  indicated vectors. Measurement of key metabolites was assessed as follows: (D) pyruvate
  levels indicating glycolytic flux, (E) NAD+/NADH ratios to estimate mitochondrial
  TCA functions, (F) L-carnitine levels to evaluate dependency on fatty acid oxidation.
  (G) Total ATP levels to estimate energy produced. (H) Schematic representation of
  metabolites in each metabolic pathway under RB1 null and RB1-overexpressed cells.
  Values represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments. Two-tailed Mann–Whitney
  test (for 2 groups) or Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (for
  >2 groups) were used for statistical analysis. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001.'
