caption: 'MG53 combined with hUC-MSCs transplantation reduces Aβ burden and Tau phosphorylation
  in AD mice. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images of Aβ. Scale bar = 100 μm.
  (B) Analysis of Aβ plaque area. (C) Expressions of Tau and p-Tau were detected by
  Western blot and (D) densitometry analysis. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. N = 3
  per group. *: Compared with the AD group, P < 0.05; #: Compared with the MSCs group,
  P < 0.05.'
article_title: MG53 protein rejuvenates hUC-MSCs and facilitates their therapeutic
  effects in AD mice by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.
