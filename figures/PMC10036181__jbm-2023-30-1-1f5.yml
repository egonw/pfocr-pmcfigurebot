caption: Example comparison of proteomes from the bone and brain of mice identifies
  important degenerative disease processes. (A) Comparison of high-quality proteome
  datasets identified from the mouse femur and from the hippocampal synaptosome show
  a large amount of similarity with an overlap accounting for nearly 40% of each individual
  dataset. (B) Ranking of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
  by the number of proteins from the overlap in each study showed between 50–200+
  individual proteins in each enriched pathway for the top 10 pathways by protein
  count. (C) Volcano plot of ‘enrichment scores’ for the identified KEGG pathways
  of the 910 shared proteins in mouse bone and brain demonstrating an overrepresentation
  for neurodegenerative disease processes and other important cellular metabolic functions.
  An false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of −log10 (FDR)>5 was used to determine pathway
  annotation. Enrichment, the number of observed genes divided by the number of expected
  genes from each KEGG category in the 910-gene list (according to Database for Annotation,
  Visualization and Integrated Discovery).
