caption: Overview of core TGFB signalling. In the canonical pathway, active TGFB binds
  to preformed dimers of type-1 (TGFBR1) and type-2 (TGFBR2) receptors to form a heterotetrametric
  active receptor complex. The constitutively active type-2 receptor activates type-1
  receptor kinase activity, allowing recruitment and phosphorylation of R-SMADs and
  the formation of complexes with SMAD4. These SMAD4 complexes translocate to the
  nucleus and regulate gene expression in combination with transcription factors,
  histone-modifying enzymes, and chromatin remodelling complexes. TGFB receptor activation
  can also trigger non-SMAD-mediated signalling (non-canonical) including activation
  of MAPK, PI3K, or Rho GTPases. Figure generated using Biorender.com (accessed 28
