caption: Omics analysis of patient-derived explants identified key biological pathways
  and novel targets. (A) Venn diagram representing the overlap between genes and proteins
  identified as differentially expressed (DE) or differentially abundant (DA) in AUY922
  treated PDEs versus DMSO (FDR < 0.05). (B) Heatmap representing 111 genes/proteins
  that were identified both as differentially expressed in the RNAseq analysis and
  differentially abundant in the proteomics analysis. (C,D) Pathway over-representation
  analysis of (C) DE genes and (D) DA proteins from Venn diagram in A. Pathways highlighted
  in green were identified by both RNAseq and proteomics analysis.
