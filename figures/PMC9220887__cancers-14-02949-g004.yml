caption: 'Mifepristone activates the unfolded protein response independent of glucocorticoid,
  estrogen and progesterone receptor inhibition. (A): Triple-negative breast cancer
  cell line (MDA-MB-468) was incubated with indicated compounds for 6 h. Whole cell
  lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies for indicated proteins.
  β-Actin was used as loading control. Uncropped immunoblots can be found in . (B):
  MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with different concentrations of CB-5083 up to 0.75
  μM and different concentrations of mifepristone (20 μM and 30 μM) for 72 h. Cell
  viability was measured using the SRB assay and dose–response curves were plotted
  with GraphPad Prism. CI stands for combination index. (C): IGROV1 cells were treated
  with indicated concentrations of DBeQ and mifepristone for 72 h. Cell viability
  was measured using SRB assay and dose–response curves were generated using GraphPad
  Prism. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.'
