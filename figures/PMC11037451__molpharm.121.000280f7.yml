caption: 'Inhibition of EGFR and growth factor pathway components prevented TRPV3
  mRNA upregulation after injury. (A) HBEC3-KT cells were treated with 5 µM solutions
  of inhibitors of multiple ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase isoforms: ErbB1 (EGFR)-specific
  inhibitor AG-1478, ErbB pan-inhibitors AZD8931 and Afatinib, and a selective ErbB2
  (HER2) inhibitor CP-724 for 2 hours in the cell passaging injury model, followed
  by analysis of TRPV3 mRNA. (B) Downstream targets of EGFR activation were also inhibited,
  and TRPV3 expression was subsequently measured 2 hours after cell passaging injury.
  Inhibitors included 5 µM TWS119 (GSK3β), 20 µM CCT036477 (β-catenin), 10 µM PD169316
  (p38 MAPK), and 10 µM SP600125 (JNK). (C) Inhibition of NF-κB (20 µM BMS-345541)
  and effects on TRPV3 mRNA 2 hours after cell passaging injury. (D) Inhibitors of
  Wnt7a and Fzd signaling were also used: 10 ng/ml secreted Frizzled-related protein
  (sFRP) and IWP 2 (Porcupine inhibitor) reduced TRPV3 upregulation after injury.
  Furthermore, SB 431542 (TGFβRI inhibitor) and 150 µM ITD-1 (TGFβRII inhibitor) were
  also tested, and SB 431542 treatment prevented TRPV3 expression as well. Values
  were normalized to vehicle controls and are presented as mean ± S.D. from n ≥ 3
  replicates. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with the
  Dunnett post-test. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. For , an unpaired t test was used.
  ****P < 0.0001.'
