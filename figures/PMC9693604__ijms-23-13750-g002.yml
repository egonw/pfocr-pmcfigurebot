caption: Activation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway by H. pylori cagA oncoprotein. Upon
  contact with the gastric epithelial cell membrane, the bacteriaâ€™s T4SS system releases
  cagA through a channel, and this triggers endocytosis, a process where proteins
  get engulfed into the cell. In the phosphorylation dependent pathway c-Src, tyrosine
  kinase phosphorylates cagA, followed by SHP2 phosphatase cleavage of the phosphate
  groups from cagA. This leads to downstream activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal
  transduction pathway which favors tumorigenesis. The phosphorylation independent
  pathway is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, which gets activated by cagA and results in products
  that induce tumorigenesis. Created with BioRender.com. (accessed on 27 September
