figure_title: Activated NOTCH signaling pathway aids in enhanced YY1 expression during
  Mtb infection
caption: (A) Mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with the indicated inhibitors
  for 1 h, followed by 24 h infection with Mtb H37Rv. Whole cell lysates were assessed
  for the expression of YY1 by immunoblotting. (B) RAW 264.7 cells were transfected
  with pCMV or NICD overexpression vectors and assessed for the transcript levels
  of Yy1 by qRT-PCR. (C) Mouse peritoneal macrophages were transfected with NT or
  Notch siRNAs. Transfected cells were infected with Mtb H37Rv for 24 h and assessed
  for the expression of YY1 and NOTCH1 by immunoblotting. (D) Mouse peritoneal macrophages
  were treated with NOTCH pathway inhibitor GSI for 1 h, followed by 24 h infection
  with Mtb H37Rv. Whole cell lysates were assessed for the expression of ITCH by immunoblotting.
  (E) RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with pCMV control or NICD overexpression vectors
  and assessed for the expression of ITCH by immunoblotting. (F, G) Mouse peritoneal
  macrophages were treated with the NOTCH pathway inhibitor GSI for 1 h, followed
  by 48 h infection with tdTomato Mtb H37Rv and analyzed for lipid accumulation (BODIPY493/503)
  by confocal microscopy; (F) representative image and (G) respective quantification.
  (H) Mouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with Mtb H37Rv for 4 h. Extracellular
  bacteria were removed, and the infected cells were cultured in the presence or absence
  of PRMT5 inhibitor, EPZ015666 for 48 h. Cells were lysed and plated on 7H11 to enumerate
  intracellular Mtb H37Rv burden. qRT-PCR data represents mean±S.E.M. and immunoblotting
  and immunofluorescence data are representative of three independent experiments.
