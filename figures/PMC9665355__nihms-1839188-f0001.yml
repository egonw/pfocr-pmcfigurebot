figure_title: Impad1 is upregulated during EMT to promote tumorigenesis
caption: (A) qPCR (left) and western blot (right) analysis of Impad1 mRNA and protein
  in human NSCLC models stratified based on their EMT status.(B) mRNA levels for Zeb1
  and E-cadherin in the same human NSCLC cell lines as in (A).(C) Correlation of IMPAD1
  mRNA with EMT status of human NSCLC cell lines (Spearman rho, 0.257; p = 0.0158).(D)
  Correlation of IMPAD1 protein staining with ZEB1 protein levels in NSCLC whole-tissue
  sections from affected individuals (Spearman rho, 0.321; p = 0.0407).(E and F) Impad1
  mRNA (left) and protein (right) expression during TGF-β1-induced (5 ng/mL, day 6)
  EMT in murine KP cells, 393P (E) and 344SQ (F). Zeb1 and E-cadherin levels are included
  as markers for EMT. Actin was used as a loading control.See also . Data are represented
  as mean of triplicates ± SD. Significance by Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; **p <
  0.002.
