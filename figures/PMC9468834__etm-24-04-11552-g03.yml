caption: IRAK1 and TRAF6 are involved in expression of miR-146a-5p-suppressed inflammatory
  factors. TargetScan Human predicted (A) IRAK1 and (B) TRAF6 as target proteins of
  miR-146a-5p. Following transfection with miR-146a-5p mimics or inhibitor, Caco-2
  cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h and collected. IRAK1 and TRAF6
  protein was extracted, separated and analyzed by western blotting. (C) Relative
  protein expression of (D) IRAK1 and (E) TRAF6 in control, IL-1β, mimic NC, mimic
  NC + IL-1β, miR-146a-5p mimic and miR-146a-5p mimic + IL-1β groups were analyzed
  with Image J. (F) Relative protein expression of (G) IRAK1 and (H) TRAF6 in control,
  IL-1β, inhibitor NC, inhibitor NC + IL-1β, miR-146a-5p inhibitor and miR-146a-5p
  inhibitor + IL-1β groups were analyzed with Image J. *Ρ<0.05, **Ρ<0.01, ***Ρ<0.001
  and ****Ρ<0.0001. IRAK1, interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; TRAF6, tumor
  necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6; UTR, untranslated region; miR, microRNA;
  NC, negative control.
