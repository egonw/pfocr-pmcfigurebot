caption: 'Alterations of the serum tryptophan metabolic pathway at 7 days post-TBI.
  Comparison of serum tryptophan (a) and major tryptophan metabolites in the indole
  pathway (b), serotonin pathway (c), and kynurenine pathway (d) at 7 days post-TBI.
  (e) Major tryptophan metabolism pathways are involved: (1) Indole pathway: Tryptophan
  can be directly metabolized by the gut microbiota into indole derivatives; (2) Serotonin
  pathway: Peripheral production of the neurotransmitter serotonin by enterochromaffin
  cells is influenced by the gut microbiota, and the brain can also synthesize serotonin;
  (3) Kynurenine pathway: kynurenine-producing pathway plays a critical role in immune
  response and neurobiological functions, which is also affected by gut microbiota.
  (f) The ratios of KYN/TRP and KYNA/KYN at 7 days post-TBI. ↑, increased; ↓, decreased
  in 7 days post-TBI mice. The tryptophan and its metabolite listed in the pathways
  were marked with black (unchanged), red (increased), and blue (decreased) solid
  boxes. Data are shown as median with range. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 *** p < 0.001
  using unpaired Student’s t test. TBI, traumatic brain injury; TRP, tryptophan; IPYA,
  indole-3-pyruvic acid; ILA, indole-3-lactic acid; IA, indole acrylic acid; IAAld,
  indole-3-acetaldehyde; IEt, indole-3-ethanol (tryptophol); IAM, indole-3-acetamide;
  IAA, indole acetic acid; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); KYN, kynurenine;
  KYNA, kynurenic acid; XA, xanthurenic acid; ns, no significant.'
