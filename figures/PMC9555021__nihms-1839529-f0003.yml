caption: Multiple tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations do not significantly disrupt
  yeast p58C structure or DNA binding. (a), Circular dichroism spectroscopy of yeast
  p58C wild-type (WT) and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants (5YF412, 5YF431, and 6YF)
  measured at 20 °C). Each curve represents the average of three smoothed measurements.
  Ellipticity for buffer and cuvette alone were subtracted from each data point. Data
  were scaled to the WT spectrum. (b), X-ray crystal structures of yeast 5YF412, 5YF431,
  and 6YF multi-tyrosine to phenylalanine p58C mutants (color) overlaid with WT p58C
  (grey, PDB ID code 6DI6). Mutated residue side chains shown. Structure for yeast
  5YF412 determined at 1.53 Å, yeast 5YF431 at 2.05 Å, and yeast 6YF at 1.80 Å. Detailed
  data collection and refinement statistics in  (c), Fluorescence polarization anisotropy
  (FA) of yeast p58C WT and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants 5YF412, 5YF431, and
  6YF, performed on ice and measured at room temperature (19-21 °C). A FITC-labeled
  8 base pair duplex fluorescent substrate that contains a single-stranded/double-stranded
  DNA junction was used. Kds are reported in .
