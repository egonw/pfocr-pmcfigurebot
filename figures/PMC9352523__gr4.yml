caption: Disrupted microbiota profiles are associated with altered monocyte gene expression
  pathways following CAP hospitalizationFunctional gene set enrichment analysis pathway
  analysis identified several immune response pathways which were significantly enriched
  in monocytes of patients with undisrupted microbiota profiles (n = 27; top) and
  pathways enriched in monocytes of patients with disrupted microbiota profiles (n =
  26; bottom). To increase interpretability, collapsed functional pathways with Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted p values <0.05 are shown. All significantly altered pathways are depicted
  in .
