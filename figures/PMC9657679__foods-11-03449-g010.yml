caption: 'RGP increased the mRNA expression of genes related to the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling
  pathway in IPEC-1 cells. The mRNA levels of these genes were detected using RT-PCR.
  (A–E) Effect of RGP (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) on the mRNA expression of caspase-3
  (A), Keap1 (B), Nrf2 (C), HO-1 (D), and NQO1 (E). The mRNA levels of all genes were
  normalized to those of GAPDH. RGP−1−A: Rehmannia glutinosa polysaccharides decolorized
  by the AB-8 macroporous resin; RGP−2−A: Rehmannia glutinosa polysaccharides decolorized
  by H2O2. Different lowercase letters on the bar graph indicate significant differences
  (p < 0.05).'
