caption: JNK activation under genotoxic stress is impaired in cells with fusion-deficient
  mitochondria. (A) U2OS control cells and MFN1 shRNA cells were treated with Phleo
  for 2 h and subjected to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. (B) U2OS cells
  transfected with control or MFN1 siRNA were treated with Phleo for 2 h and subjected
  to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. Quantification on the phospho-JNK levels
  was shown at the lower panel. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.
  *** P < 0.001 versus control siRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (C) Flag-MFN1
  plasmid was transfected into MFN1 depleted cells and treated with H2O2 for 20 min,
  and cells were immunoblotted. Band intensities of p-JNK level were determined by
  ImageJ. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001
  versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (D) U2OS cells were
  transfected with OPA1-targeting shRNA for 48 h and treated with H2O2 for 20 min.
  The cell lysates were processed for immunoblotting analysis using indicated antibodies
  and quantification of p-JNK level was determined by using ImageJ. Bars represent
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA
  by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (E) Myc-hFis1 plasmid was transfected into
  U2OS cells and cells were obtained with H2O2 treatment for 20 min. The lysates were
  immunoblotted with indicated antibodies and expression levels of the phospho-JNK
  were quantified from western blot images. Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent
  experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's
  t-test. (F) U2OS cells were treated with 50 mM of glucose for 5 hr and subjected
  to Phleo for additional 2 hr before harvest, followed by immunoblotted with indicated
  antibodies. Quantification of p-JNK band intensities was measured using imageJ.
  Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 versus
  control shRNA by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test. (G) U2OS 2–6-5 cells were
  transfected with siRNA for MFN1 and DSB was induced by addition of 4-OHT and shield1
  for 4 h. The cells were then treated with H2O2 for 20 min before harvest. The intensity
  of p-JNK level at DSB foci was shown as relative fluorescence mean intensity (RFMI).
  Bars represent mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; nsiCtrl= 36, nsiMFN1= 42
  cells. *** P < 0.001 by Student's t-test. scale bars, 10 μm.
