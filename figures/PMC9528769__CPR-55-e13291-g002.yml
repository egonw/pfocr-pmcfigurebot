caption: Urolithin B inhibits NF‐κB and ERK signalling pathways inhibit RANKL induced
  osteoclast differentiation. (A‐B) Typical Western blot images showed the levels
  of NF‐κB and MAPK pathway proteins in RANKL and RANKL + UB treated raw264.7 cells
  at 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min (C‐H) The histogram shows the relative levels of p‐P65、p‐IκBα、p‐JNK、p‐P38
  、p‐ERK proteins in RANKL and RANKL + UB treated raw264.7 cells at 0, 5, 15, 30 and
  60 min. n = 3 per group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 versus the RANKL induced group at
  the same time point (I, K) Representative Western blot images showed the corresponding
  expression levels of p‐P65 and p‐ERK after 30 min of intervention in the blank group,
  50 ng/ml RANKL and 0, 1, 5 or 25 μM UB intervention groups. (J, L) Histograms show
  the corresponding expression levels of p‐P65 and p‐ERK after 30 min of intervention
  in the blank group, 50 ng/ml RANKL and 0, 1, 5 or 25 μM UB intervention groups.
  n = 3 per group, *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus the RANKL induced group (without
  UB treatment)
