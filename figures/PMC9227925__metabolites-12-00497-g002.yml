caption: 'MALDI negative mode imaging of skin tissue: (a) Nonmetric dimensional plot
  of the metabolites present in fresh frozen and FFPE samples. Significant p-values
  from ANOSIM test showed there are differences in the metabolic profiles of the group
  tested (Stress: 0.03219174, ANOSIM statistic R: 1, significance: 1 × 10−4). (b)
  The heatmap plot of the top 50 most significantly different metabolites between
  the two groups. (c) Venn diagram showing the unique and shared putative metabolites
  between the two comparisons. (d–f) Metabolic pathway analysis plot created using
  MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Plots depict several metabolic pathway alterations when unique
  and shared metabolites from the fresh frozen and FFPE samples were tested. (d) Differential
  metabolites calculated from FFPE vs. fresh frozen. (e) Common metabolites from the
  Venn diagram were sorted based on p-value (high to low). (f) Differential metabolites
  calculated from fresh frozen vs. FFPE. (Pathway graph color box corresponds to the
  same color in Venn diagram). The y-axis is the –log10 of the p-value; pathways that
  were most significantly changed are characterized by high –log10(p) values (top
  middle or right region). (g) The top 50 common metabolites were sorted based on
  p-value and represented as a heatmap. (h–j) Specific metabolite distribution images
  are presented along with an intensity box plot. (h) HBMP 16:2_20:0_18:3 distribution
  in both tissues and an intensity box plot of the same metabolite’s distribution.
  (i) NPA001813 distribution in both tissues and an intensity box plot of the same
  metabolite’s distribution. (j) PE 44:2_36:8 distribution in both tissues and an
  intensity box plot of the same metabolite’s distribution.'
