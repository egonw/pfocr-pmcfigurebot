caption: Identification and functional annotation of NIFK-AS1-related differentially-expressed
  PCGs. (A) VP of PCGs in the high and low NIFK-AS1 gene expression groups in HCC
  tumor tissue. (B) Bubble chart of the top 10 significant enrichment pathways. (C)
  Through the KEGG pathway, the enrichment analysis of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  showed that PCGs were significantly related to the cell cycle NIFK-AS1, NIFK antisense
  RNA 1; VP, volcano plot; PCG, Protein-Coding Gene; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
  ROC, receiver operating characteristic.

  progression through interaction with SRSF10.
