caption: 'a Western blotting of MDK, LKB1 and β-actin from HCCLM3 cells transduced
  with LKB1 shRNA or in combination with MDK shRNA. b–c Colony-forming assay of the
  HCCLM3 cells transduced with LKB1 shRNA or in combination with MDK shRNA. Images
  (b) and quantification (c) of colony formation. n = 3 wells per group. Scale bar,
  200 μm. d GSEA results showing the negative correlations between MDK and the AMPK
  signaling pathway based on the TCGA LIHC and KIRC cohorts. Genes in the RNA-seq
  data were ranked by the Pearson coefficients of the correlations between the genes
  and MDK, and the ranked gene list was utilized as the input for the GSEA software
  program. e–f Scatter plots showing the inverse correlation of MDK with p-AMPKα expression
  and MDK expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma tumors (e), Kaplan–Meier survival
  curves of HCC patients with data stratified by MDK expression levels (f) (n = 74).
  g Scatter plots showing the inverse correlation of MDK AMPK activity in the TCGA
  LIHC and KIRC cohorts (LIHC n = 371, KIRC n = 531). Gene expression was obtained
  from RNA-seq data from the TCGA. AMPK activity was estimated by the expression of
  their downstream target genes. Statistical significance in (e-g) was determined
  by Pearson correlation test. R: Pearson correlation coefficient. R, Spearman rank
  correlation coefficient. h Kaplan–Meier survival curves of the TCGA KIRC patients
  with data stratified by the expression of MDK and the activity of AMPK. HL: MDK
  is high, AMPK activity is low; LH: MDK is low, AMPK activity is high. Median expression/activity
  levels were utilized as the thresholds for high and low separation. i. Schematic
  illustration of the MDK mechanisms of action: high MDK expression depolymerizes
  the LKB1-STRAD-Mo25 complex and subsequently suppresses the activity of AMPK signaling
  in human cancers.'
