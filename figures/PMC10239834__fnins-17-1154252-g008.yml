caption: 'HBNW response to translational motion sequences. Here we plotted HBNW response
  to translational motion sequence: 180°. (A) represents a frame in an input sequence
  and corresponding DSMN response is shown in (B). Hebbian network (16 × 16 × 8) response
  titled as “HBNW Resp” is plotted in (C). At each vertical column, the winner is
  highlighted with the arrow whose head indicate the neuron’s direction preference.'
