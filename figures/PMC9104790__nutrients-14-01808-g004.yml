caption: 'Volcano plots, KEGG pathways, and GO analysis of differentially expressed
  lncRNAs in response to the oral gavage of milk-derived EVs in the DSS-induced murine
  colitis model. (A): Volcano plots of differentially expressed lncRNAs were formed
  with the log2 ratio and −log10 adjusted p-values for the DSS group versus the DSS
  + MID group, where log2 (FC) > 2 and p < 0.05 represent up-regulation, log2(FC)
  < −2 and p < 0.05 represent down-regulation, and the probes in blue represent significance
  (p < 0.05) with small fold changes (log2(FC) > −2 and <2). (B): Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed the biological pathways that were
  enriched in the differentially expressed lncRNAs. The Y-axis label is the pathway,
  and the X-axis label is the rich factor (rich factor = the number of differentially
  expressed lncRNAs enrichment in the pathway/ all lncRNAs). (C): The enriched GO
  terms. n = 6 samples/group.'
