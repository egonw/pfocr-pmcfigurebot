caption: 'Quantitative analysis of neurite length and the proliferation activity in
  different groups. (a) Morphological observation for micrographs of SH-SY5Y cells
  and neurites. (b and c) The histogram revealed the attenuance 570 values and the
  neurite length of SH-SY5Y cells in different groups. After transfection with mimic
  miRNA-29a-3p, the cell proliferation activity was significantly increased, and the
  neurites became significantly longer. While in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p group,
  the SH-SY5Y cell proliferation activity and neurite length were minimum (∗∗∗: p
  < 0.001; ∗∗: p < 0.01; ∗: p < 0.05). For each different group, the SH-SY5Y cells
  was separately repeatedly measured 6 times.'
