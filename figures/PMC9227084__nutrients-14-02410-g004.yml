caption: 'IHC staining results of mTOR and p-mTOR of livers in different groups. (A)
  Representative IHC staining of mTOR and p-mTOR in the portal and central venous
  regions. (B,C) The positive staining rates of mTOR in the portal and central venous
  regions. (D,E) The positive staining rates of p-mTOR in the portal and central venous
  regions. Scale bar: 200 Î¼m. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Se: selenium;
