caption: 'Pathway enrichment analysis of metagene factors. (a) Manhattan plot of the
  GSEA results on the metagenes (n=50) and factors (n=98) learned by HYFA. The x-axis
  represents metagenes (colored bins) and every offset within the bin corresponds
  to a different factor. The y-axis is the −log q-value (FDR) from the GSEA permutation
  test, corrected for multiple testing via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We identified
  18683 statistically significant enrichments (FDR < 0.05) of KEGG biological processes
  across all metagenes and factors. (b) Total number of enriched terms for each type
  of pathway. (c) FDR for pathways of neurodegeneration. For every pathway and metagene,
  we selected the factor with lowest FDR and depicted statistically significant values
  (FDR < 0.05). Point sizes are proportional to −log FDR values. Metagene 11 (factor
  95) had the lowest FDR for both Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s
  Disease. (d) UMAP of latent values of metagene 11 for all spinal cord (ALS: orange)
  and brain cortex (Alzheimer’s disease or Dementia: orange) GTEx samples. (e) Leading
  edge subsets of top-15 enriched gene sets for factor 95 of metagene 11. (f, g) Enrichment
  plots for Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (f) and Alzheimer’s disease gene sets (g).'
