caption: 'Poricoic acid A (PAA) inhibits the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in renal
  tissue of rats with cardiorenal syndrome. (a-c) western blot was performed to detect
  the expression level of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins (p-NF-κB,
  NF-κB, p-IKBα, IKBα, p-P38, P38, p-ERK, and ERK) in renal tissue of rats in each
  group. ∗∗P < 0.01vs. the Sham group; #P < 0.05vs. the CRS group.'
