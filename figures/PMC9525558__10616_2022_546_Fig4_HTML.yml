caption: 'KDM1A overexpression reversed the T24 cell suppression caused by salinomycin.
  T24 cells transfected with the KDM1A overexpression plasmid or empty vector were
  treated with 5 μM salinomycin. A and B CCK-8 assays and Edu staining were used to
  assess the effect on cell proliferation (red indicates a nEdu-positive signal and
  blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI), C The expression of apoptosis-related
  proteins was detected by western blotting, D Apoptosis was detected by Tunel staining
  (red indicates a Tunel-positive signal and blue indicates nuclei stained with DAPI),
  E The levels of SOD and MDA were detected by ELISA, F The expression of UPR pathway-related
  proteins was evaluated by western blotting, G KDM1A expression was evaluated by
  RT-qPCR, H KDM1A expression and H3K4 di-methylation were detected by western blotting,
  I H3K4 histone di-methylation levels were detected by ELISA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, vs. Control; ###, P < 0.001, vs. salinomycin'
