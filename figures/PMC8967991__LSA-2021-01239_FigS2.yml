figure_title: ESCRT-I dysfunction causes enlargement of lysosomes in DLD-1 cells
caption: '(A) Western blots showing the depletion efficiencies of ESCRT-I subunits,
  Tsg101, or Vps28 (using single siRNAs for each subunit, #1 or #2) as compared with
  control conditions (nontargeting siRNAs Ctrl#1 or #2). The GAPDH protein is shown
  as a loading control. (B) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of live cells,
  showing the intracellular distribution of lysosomes marked with LysoTracker dye
  (red) in control or ESCRT-I–depleted cells. Cell nuclei marked with Hoechst stain
  (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. (B, C, D) Dot plots showing average fluorescence intensities
  of LysoTracker expressed in arbitrary units (a.u., C) and mean area (D) of detected
  lysosomal structures in control or ESCRT-depleted cells, calculated based on live-cell
  microscopy images (shown in B). Values derived from independent experiments (dots)
  and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by
  comparison to averaged values measured for siCtrl#1 and #2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.'
