figure_title: STAT1 mediates radiation-induced CD39 expression via STAT1-IRF1 pathway
caption: A t-SNE generated from published data of single-cell RNA sequencing showed
  relative expression levels of ENTPD1, encoding CD39, in different clusters of human
  GBM. 51 A and 66 A cells were transfected with plasmid with gRNA targeting STAT1
  for 48 h or pretreated with fludarabine, a STAT1 pathway inhibitor, 30 μM for 6 h,
  then were irradiated with 10 Gy. The level of CD39 protein on cell surface was detected
  using flow cytometry 24 hours following IR (B), and mRNA expression was measured
  using RT-qPCR 12 hours after IR (C). D Cells were irradiated with 10 Gy, and the
  protein levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and IRF1 were tested using western blot 12 hours
  after IR. Cells were transfected with NTC, pc-DNA-STAT1 or pc-DNA-IRF1 expression
  plasmids, then CD39 protein (E) and mRNA (F) expressions were determined. G The
  nucleotide sequence of putative IRF1 binding site in CD39 promotor was shown in
  red. H After 48 h transfection with luciferase reporter pGL3 plasmid carrying CD39
  promotor, the luciferase activities in cell lysate were measured by dual-luciferase
  reporter system when cells were irradiated with 10 Gy or co-transfected with IRF1
  expression plasmid. The firefly luminescence signal was normalized based on the
  Renilla luminescence signal. I After transfection with pGL3-CD39 promotor WT or
  pGL3-CD39 promotor IRF1∆ plasmid, the luciferase activities were measured following
  IR or IRF1 plasmid transfection. J ChIP assay was performed using anti-IRF1 antibody,
  the results of qPCR products were shown using primers flanking the IRF1 binding
  site. K Correlation of CD39 and IRF1 expressions from TCGA database was analyzed
  in GBM patients. L The expressions of signature immune gene sets based on ENTPD1
  expression levels from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were shown using
  heatmap according to z-score normalized log-cpm values. n = 170. M IR activates
  STAT1-IRF1-CD39 axis to form an immunosuppressive TME. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
