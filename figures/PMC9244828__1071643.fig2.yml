caption: 'αIIbβ3 activation and granule secretion are defective in PT-VWD. (A) Integrin
  αIIbβ3 activation (PAC-1 binding) as assessed by flow cytometry in response to TRAP-6
  20 mM (i), ADP 10 mM (ii) and CVX 20 ng/mL (iii) in human whole blood from the PT-VWD
  patient and a parallel healthy control. PAC-1 binding is reported as percentage
  of positive platelets, calculated as the percentage of platelets (gated for their
  forward scatter and side scatter values and for their positivity to the platelet
  marker CD42b) that bound PAC-1 over the total platelet population after setting
  for aspecific binding. Data are means ± SEM from at least five independent experiments
  (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples A, B, C, D, E). **P<0.01 vs. control, Two-way
  ANOVA. (B) Integrin αIIbβ3 activation (JON-A binding) as assessed by flow cytometry
  in response to thrombin 0.05 U/mL + GPRP 2 mM and convulxin 25 ng/mL in murine whole
  blood from TgG233V and TgWT mice. Jon-A binding is reported as percentage of positive
  platelets, calculated as the percentage of platelets (gated for their forward scatter
  and side scatter values and for their positivity to the platelet marker CD42b) that
  bound Jon-A over the total platelet population, after setting for aspecific binding.
  Data are means ± SEM, n=5 (TgWT: three females and two males, mean platelet count:
  627850±21566/mL; TgG233V: three females and two males; mean platelet count: 330600±17677/mL).
  **P<0.01 vs. TgWT, two-way ANOVA. (C) Representative images of the ultrastructure
  of human control and PT-VWD platelets used to assess granular content (original
  magnification 13000X). Specimens were observed with a Philips Electron Optics EM208
  transmission electron microscope at 80 kV at room temperature. Granules were counted
  from at least 50 platelets (α-granules: 5.8±0.4 vs. 6.4±1.3/platelet; dense granules:
  0.7±0.4 vs. 0.9±0.3/platelet, P=ns). Black arrowheads indicate examples of a-granules;
  white arrowheads indicate examples of dense granules. Dense granules were defined
  by their highly electron-dense core surrounded by a clear space enclosed by a single
  membrane. D-E) α-granule secretion in human (D) and murine (E) platelets as assessed
  by the measurement of P-selectin expression by flow cytometry. Agonists were ADP
  10 mM, TRAP6 10 mM or CVX 20 ng/mL for human platelets and thrombin 0.05 U/mL +
  GPRP 2 mM or CVX 25 ng/mL for murine platelets. P-selectin expression is reported
  as a percentage of positive platelets, calculated as the percentage of platelets
  (gated for their forward scatter and side scatter values and for their positivity
  to the platelet marker CD41) that bound CD62P over the total platelet population,
  after setting for aspecific binding. Data are means ± SEM from at least five independent
  experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples A, B, C, D, E) or from n=5 mice
  (TgWT: three females and two males, mean platelet count: 627850±21566/mL; TgG233V:
  three females and two males; mean platelet count: 330600±17677/mL). **P<0.01; two-way
  ANOVA. (F,G) Dense granule secretion in human (F) and murine (G) platelets as assessed
  by the measurement of mepacrine release by flow cytometry. Mepacrine release was
  calculated by the following formula: 1-(residual mepacrine content after thrombin
  stimulation with 0.05 U/mL/ total mepacrine incorporated)x100. “Total mepacrine
  incorporated” is the percentage of platelets (gated for their forward scatter and
  side scatter values and for their positivity to the platelet markers CD41 or CD42b)
  that incorporated mepacrine over the total platelet population, after setting for
  aspecific binding; “residual mepacrine content” is the percentage of platelets stimulated
  with 0.05 U/mL of thrombin that incorporated mepacrine over the total platelet population,
  after setting for aspecific binding. Data are means ± SEM from at least 5 independent
  experiments (Online Supplementary Table S1, samples A, B, C, D, E) or from n=5 mice
  (TgWT: three females and two males, mean platelet count: 627850±21566/mL; TgG233V:
  three females and two males; mean platelet count: 330600±17677/mL). *P<0.05, **P<0.01;
  unpaired Student’s t test.'
