caption: Schematic diagram of Annong 0711 wheat grain genes enriched in the “mitogen
  activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway” (map04016) and “plant–pathogen
  interaction pathway” (map04626). The blue font indicated that the genes that encode
  the protein were relatively lowly expressed in Annong 0711 compared to Sumai 3 wheat
  grains.
