caption: Differentially expressed transcription factors in VS-HC and LLV-VS groups.
  A–B Relative expression levels of DEGs in NF-κB (A) and TNF signaling pathway (B)
  in HC, VS, and LLV individuals. C–D Betweenness-based networks formed by differentially
  expressed transcription factors in VS-HC (C) and LLV-VS groups (D). Betweenness
  scores are mapped by color intensity.
