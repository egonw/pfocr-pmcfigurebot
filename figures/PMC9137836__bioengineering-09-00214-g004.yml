caption: Id2â€™s role in reversing cell cycle arrest, illustrating the role of miR-758-5p
  in regulating Id2 and the consequence of upregulating Id2 via the activation of
  the MAPK signaling pathway. As part of the recovery process following radiation
  exposure, Id2 is expressed and binds to Rb. This interaction prevents binding to
  its other binding partner EF2, thus inducing cell proliferation []. The blue arrows
  in the figure represent pathway activation, whereas the red arrows illustrate pathway
  inhibition.
