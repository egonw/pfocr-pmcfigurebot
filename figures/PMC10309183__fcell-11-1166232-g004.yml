caption: Peroxisomal core ether lipid biosynthetic pathway is present in sperm. In
  somatic cells, ether lipid biosynthesis is initiated in peroxisomes (A) and is finalized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (B) where enzymes may be able to use both acyl and
  alkyl precursors (question mark). Boxed enzymes and pathways labelled in gold are
  found in sperm according to ; , ; ;  and . Note peroxisome and ER compartments are
  believed to be missing in sperm. DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glycerol
  3-phosphate; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; GNPAT, DHAP acyltransferase;
  AGPS, alkyl-DHAP synthase; DHRS7B, acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase; FAR; fatty acyl-CoA
  reductase; FALDH fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase; GPAT, G3-P acyltransferase; AGPAT,
  1-acyl G3-P acyltransferase; LPIN, lipin PA phosphatase.
