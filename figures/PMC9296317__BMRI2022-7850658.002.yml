caption: SLC6A14 upregulation is a risk stratification factor for GC patients with
  metastasis and poor prognosis. (a) Quantitative study of SLC6A14 mRNA in GC and
  paired ANTs was carried out by Quantitative Real-time PCR analysis. Data are demonstrated
  as the relative expression towards GAPDH with the means ± SD from three independent
  experiments. ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (b) Protein level of SLC6A14 in GC and corresponding
  ANTs was determined using Western blot assay. Data are shown as the representatives
  (upper panels) and the relative expression towards β-actin with the means ± SD of
  three replicates (bottom panels). ∗∗P < 0.01 and∗∗∗P < 0.001. (c) SLC6A14 expression
  in serial samples from GC patients was examined by immunohistochemical staining.
  Data are manifested as the representative images (upper panels) and staining scores
  for SLC6A14 with the means ± SD from three independent experiments (bottom panel).
  ∗∗P < 0.01. (d) Overall survival (OS) and (e) disease-free survival (DFS) curves
  of GC patients were generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the correlation between
  SLC6A14 expression and OS or DFS time was evaluated by log-rank test. ∗∗P = 0.002 and∗∗P
  = 0.007 were considered to be statistically significant.
