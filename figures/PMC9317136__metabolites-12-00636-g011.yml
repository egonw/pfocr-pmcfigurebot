caption: Effect of ERK1/2 cascade inhibitor on the taurine-induced increase in TXNIP
  promoter. After transfection with a reporter vector containing the promoter region
  of TXNIP (+200/+218), Caco-2 cells were pretreated with 50 µM PD98059 for 2 h and
  then cultured in medium containing 100 mM of taurine and the inhibitor. After 24
  h, the cells were subjected to a luciferase assay. The results are expressed as
  relative values, with the control value without inhibitor as 1. Each value is the
  mean ± S.E. (n = 3) and the ab values indicated by different characters are significantly
  different from each other and the ab values indicated by the same characters are
  not significantly different (Tukey’s test; p < 0.05).
