figure_title: Cellular and molecular events associated with muscle denervation and
  repair at the neuromuscular junction level. (A) Denervated, (B) healthy, and (C)
  HFB repaired neuromuscular junction. Following nerve injury, all components of the
  NMJ are hindered and the Agrin/LRP4/Musk/Rapsyn signaling pathway plays a significant
  role in the nAChRs cluster formation and NMJ maintenance
