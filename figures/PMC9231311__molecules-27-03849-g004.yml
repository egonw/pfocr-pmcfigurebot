caption: 'Three major mechanisms of anti-inflammatory activities shown by compounds
  isolated from medicinal plants of Tropical Australia: (a) inhibition of NF-κB pathway;
  (b) inhibition of various pro-inflammatory cytokines; (c) inhibition of cyclooxygenase
  enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) activities. Abbreviations: COX (COX-1 and 2), cyclooxygenase
  1 and 2; IL, interleukins; GSDMD, Gasdermin-D; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; Nlrp3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; PG, prostaglandins
  (PGI2, PGE2); Th cells, T-helper cells (Th1, 2); Th0, naïve T helper cells; Treg,
  regulatory T helper cells; TX, thromboxane (TXA2); TGF, transforming growth factor
  (TGF-β); TNF, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α); TLR, toll-like receptor. Courtesy:
