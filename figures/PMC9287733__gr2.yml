caption: 'Model I: NRF2 ultrasensitivity arising from saturable NRF2 sequestration
  and degradation by KEAP1. (A) Structure of Model I, containing constitutive synthesis
  of NRF2 (k0 step), KEAP1-independent NRF2 degradation (k1), reversible binding of
  NRF2 and KEAP1 (kf and kb), and KEAP1-dependent NRF2 degradation and concurrent
  recycling of KEAP1 (k2) which can be inhibited by electrophilic stressor S (Kd1).
  (B) Simulated steady-state dose-response of various state variables as indicated,
  with free NRF2 (NRF2free) exhibiting ultrasensitivity. (C) The degree of ultrasensitivity
  of the NRF2freeresponse is modulated by the binding affinity between NRF2 and KEAP1
  as indicated by different kf values. (D) The degree of ultrasensitivity of the NRF2freeresponse
  is modulated by the total abundance of KEAP1 (KEAP1tot) as indicated. x 1* denotes
  using the default parameter values, x 0.5 and x 2 denote using half and twice the
  default values respectively.'
