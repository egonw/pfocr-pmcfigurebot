figure_title: Application of optogenetics to study the effects of localized cAMP perturbations
  in epithelial monolayers
caption: 'Optogenetic approach to study the effects of localized cAMP perturbations
  in monolayers: First panel: Top: bPAC, a blue light responsive adenylyl cyclase
  from bacteria. Bottom: The bPAC input is a sequence of spatially-uniform, constant
  amplitude (between 0 and 1) pulses of blue light. Second panel: Cell lines: The
  emitter has bPAC and pathway reporters while the receiver has only pathway reporters.
  Third panel: Monolayer of just emitters (spatially uniform cAMP perturbation). Fourth
  panel: Monolayer with a small emitter cluster surrounded by receivers (localized
  cAMP perturbation). We define a small emitter cluster as a concentrated group of
  15 or less emitters.'

  effects of a local, dynamic gap junction state on ERK signaling.
