caption: 'Biosynthesis and core signaling pathways of jasmonic acid (JA) in Arabidopsis
  and Marchantia polymorpha. There are three synthetic pathways in Arabidopsis (right):
  (1) the 18:3 pathway; (2) the 16:3 pathway; and (3) the independent OPR3 pathway,
  in which the cytoplasm JAR1 catalyzes JA to form JA-Ile with biological activity.
  JA-Ile interacts with the COI1-JAZ complex to degrade JAZ(s) by ubiquitination through
  the 26S proteasome degradation pathway. The difference in jasmonic acid evolution
  between Marchantia polymorpha (left) and Arabidopsis is mainly reflected in (1)
  the number of JAZ and MYC genes in M. polymorpha and Arabidopsis; (2) the bioactive
  COI1-JAZ ligand is dnOPDA in M. polymorpha, but JA-Ile in Arabidopsis. The mechanisms
  of MYC and MED25 in the JA signaling pathway in M. polymorpha are not proven (question
  mark). Ub, ubiquitin. Arrows: activations; bar-headed arrows: repressions.'
