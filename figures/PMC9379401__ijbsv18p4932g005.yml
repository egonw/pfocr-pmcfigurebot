caption: CPNE8 overexpression enhanced GC metastasis in vivo. (A) The representative
  image demonstrated the tumor-bearing mice subcutaneously injected with BGC823 cells
  overexpressing CPNE8 versus control mice and the tumors harvested from the nude
  mice. (B) Tumor volumes were recorded every 3 days. Data are represented as mean
  Â± SD of five mice in each group. (C) Significant increase in tumor weight of mice
  with overexpression of CPNE8. (D) Immunofluorescence staining of the proliferation
  marker revealed a higher expression of Ki67 in tumors overexpressing CPNE8. (E)
  Representative images of HE staining of lungs were collected from mice injected
  with GC cells via tail vein. Results are also expressed as metastatic lung index
  (lung tumor area/total lung area) analyzed in mice bearing the metastasis. (F) Immunohistochemistry
  staining of CPNE8 and FAK in GC tissues harvested from the xenograft mice.
