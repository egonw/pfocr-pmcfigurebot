figure_title: Characterization of the lipogenic effects of treatment of human primary
  macrophages with conditioned medium from ACHN cell cultures
caption: Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were incubated with ACHN-conditioned medium;
  lipid droplet and neutral lipid content was measured after 7 days of treatment.
  A. Lipid droplet content of MDM determined by imaging flow cytometry. Representative
  images of MDM untreated and ACHN-treated stained with Bodipy 493/503 (neutral lipid
  dye, green fluorescence) acquired by imaging flow cytometry. B. Quantification of
  lipid droplet content by imaging flow cytometry expressed as median fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) of Bodipy 493/503. Each dot represents one human donor. C. Neutral
  lipid measurements in MDM. TAG and cholesterol were measured in infected and uninfected
  cells using a commercially available kit. The box plots show lower quartile, median,
  and upper quartile of the distribution of multiple donors. The whiskers represent
  minimum and maximum values. The plus symbol indicates the mean. *, p < 0.05; **,
  p < 0.01 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). D. Pathway analysis of the transcriptome of
  ACHN-medium-treated MDM. The panel shows Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related
  to metabolic processes that were upregulated in ACHN-medium-treated MDM, relative
  to untreated control cells. The differential expression between sample classes (infected
  vs uninfected) was tested with coincident extreme ranks in numerical observations
  (CERNO). Pathways were selected using a cutoff false discovery rate of 0.055; the
  p-values for these pathways are plotted onto the x-axis. To represent effect size,
  pathway gene sets containing fewer genes were given greater bar height/font size
  than were larger sets that yielded similar p values. It is noted that immunoglobulin
  production by macrophages in the context of tumor microenvironments has been described
  () - it is not discussed as it does not appear relevant to the topic of our report.
  Additional pathway analysis data are shown in .
