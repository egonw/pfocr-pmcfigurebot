caption: Mechanism of tunicamycin-induced ER stress promotes breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231
  apoptosis. Tunicamycin is an activator of ER stress. It inhibits the ER glycosylation
  process and causes ER stress. After ER stress is activated, it inhibits the Wnt
  signaling pathway. When this pathway is suppressed, β-catenin phosphorylation is
  increased, resulting in a decrease in nuclear β-catenin, affecting the activation
  of downstream gene c-Myc transcription, and ultimately promoting breast cancer cell
  MDA-MB-231 apoptosis.
