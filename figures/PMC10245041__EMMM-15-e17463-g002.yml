figure_title: Elac2 A537T variant and Elac2 deletion impair tRNA processing leading
  to transcriptome‐wide changes that promote prostate tumorigenesis
caption: Transcriptome analysis of mitochondrial transcripts by RNA‐Seq in prostates
  from 10‐ and 30‐week‐old mice. AComplete maps of the changes in mitochondrial transcript
  abundance determined by mean RNA‐Seq coverage from KO and A537T mice (n = 3 of each
  line; relative to WT controls) on heavy (first four tracks) and light (bottom four
  tracks) strands of the mtDNA. Increases are shown in red, and decreases are shown
  in blue (log2 [RPMKO/RPMWT] or log2 [RPMA537T/RPMWT]; scale ranges, −2 to 3.5).
  The mitochondrial genome is displayed in the centre; mRNAs are in blue, tRNAs are
  in grey, and rRNAs are in green.BFrequency distribution of prostate nuclear precursor
  tRNA reads isolated from control, KO and A537T mice (n = 3 of each genotype). Windows
  are centred on reads that align 50 nt away from either side of all annotated 3′
  ends of nuclear tRNAs marked as 0.CGenome browser view of the mean RNA‐Seq coverage
  of the KO‐TRAMP (log2[RPMKO‐TRAMP/RPMWT‐TRAMP]) or A537T‐TRAMP (log2[RPMA537T‐TRAMP/RPMWT‐TRAMP])
  mice; scale ranges, −1 to 3.5.D, EGene ontology changes in gene expression show
  the significantly changing biological processes in 30‐week‐old (D) KO and A537T
  or (E) KO‐TRAMP and A537T‐TRAMP mice compared with their respective controls. The
  colour scale represents fold change (FC) for each pathway, and set size shows the
  number of genes within each pathway.
