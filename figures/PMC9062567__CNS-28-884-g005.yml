caption: Depletion of circ_0055412 enhances the cisplatin sensitivity of glioma cells
  in vitro and in vivo. (A) The knockdown efficacy of sh‐circ_0055412#1/2/3 was evaluated
  by RT‐qPCR in U251/DDP and LN229/DDP cells. (B, C) CCK‐8 assay was conducted to
  examine the change of DDP resistance in DDP‐resistant U251 and LN229 cells after
  circ_0055412 was silenced. (D) EdU assay was performed to examine cell proliferation
  with or without the treatment of DDP. (E, F) The apoptotic rate of DDP‐resistant
  U251 and LN229 cells was evaluated by TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01
