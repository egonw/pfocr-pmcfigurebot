caption: The NK cells were detected in WT clinic sample. The proportion of CD3−CD16+CD56+
  NK in PBMCs were analyzed in WT patients (n = 30) and normal children (n = 30) by
  FACS (a, b). The proportion of CD3−CD16+CD56+ NK in WT patient PBMCs with different
  stage (c). The CD16+, CD56+ and CD16+, and CD56+ NK cells were detected in paired
  WT samples (n = 30) by immunofluorescence staining (d, e). Cytotoxic cytokines were
  detected by ELISA in paired WT samples (n = 30). Results are shown as mean ± SD.
  For comparisons, Student's t-test was performed in two group, or one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA) was performed in multiple groups. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
