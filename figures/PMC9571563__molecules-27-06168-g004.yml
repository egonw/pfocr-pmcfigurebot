caption: The effects of ellagic acid on the daf-16 mutant worms (CF1308) and daf-2
  and daf-16 double-mutant strains (CF1588) exposed to UV radiation stress. (A) The
  daf-16 mutant worms CF1308 in the L4-stage were transferred onto NGM agar plates
  with 50 μM ellagic acid or without ellagic acid for two days. Then, the worms were
  exposed to a dose of 1000 J/cm2 of UV radiation, n > 100. (B) The survival of the
  daf-2 and daf-16 double-mutant nematodes exposed to UV radiation with 50 μM ellagic
  acid or without ellagic acid treatment, n > 100.
