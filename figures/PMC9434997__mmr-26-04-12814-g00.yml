caption: General cyclic AMP signaling pathway. cAMP is a nucleotide that acts as an
  important secondary transporter in numerous signal transmission pathways. The generation
  of cAMP is regulated by AC in a G-protein-dependent manner. The decomposition of
  cAMP is regulated by PDE. cAMP is involved in several signal transmission pathways,
  including controlling ion channel operation and PKA activity. When PKA is activated,
  phosphorylation of CREB activates the transcription of various target genes. This
  regulates various cell functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation,
  gene transcription, and protein expression. AC, adenylyl cyclase; CREB, cAMP reactive
  element binding protein; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PDE, phosphodiesterase;
  PKA, protein kinase A.
