figure_title: PARD6A potentially correlates with ovarian cancer clinically
caption: A Representative images of immunohistochemistry detections of protein levels
  of PAR6α in serous, mucinous, and clear cell subtypes of ovarian cancer tissues
  versus normal ovarian epithial tissues. B Representative images of immunohistochemistry
  detections of protein levels of PAR6α in Stages I-II versus Stages III-IV of serous,
  mucinous, and clear cell subtypes of ovarian cancer tissues. C Representative images
  of immunohistochemistry detections of protein levels of PAR6α in poorly, moderately,
  and well differentiated ovarian cancer tissues in serous, mucinous, and clear cell
  subtypes. Scale bar = 50 µm.
