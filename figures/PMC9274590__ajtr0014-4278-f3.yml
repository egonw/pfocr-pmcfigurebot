caption: 'Moxibustion reduced the expression of RAGE and HMGB1 in rat intestinal tissues.
  A. upper: Representative immunofluorescence images showing the expression of RAGE
  (green) in the ileum and colon. Scale bar: 50 μm. lower: A quantitative analysis
  indicated that moxibustion reduced the 5-Fu-induced expression of RAGE in the ileum
  and colon, and moxibustion intervention at 15 min/day exerted a better inhibitory
  effect. The intensity of the immunofluorescence intensity of RAGE in four fields
  of each tissue per rat was quantified using Image J. The bars represent the means
  ± SEMs (n = 4 per group). bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu
  group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu+Moxibustion-15 min/day group. B. Representative
  Western blot images showing the protein expression of RAGE and GAPDH (loading control).
  A quantitative analysis indicated that moxibustion reduced the 5-Fu-induced expression
  of RAGE expression in the ileum and colon. Moxibustion intervention at 15 min/day
  exerted a better inhibitory effect. The bars represent the means ± SEMs (n = 4 per
  group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs
  the 5-Fu group; fP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu+Moxibustion-15 min/day group. C. The mRNA
  expression of HMGB1 in the ileum and colon was evaluated by qPCR. The bars represent
  the means ± SEMs (n = 6 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group;
  cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu+Moxibustion-15
  min/day group.'
