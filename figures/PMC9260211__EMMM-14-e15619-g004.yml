figure_title: PI3K pathway activation in ECs leads to enhanced cell cycle progression
caption: AImmunoblot showing the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway (by assessing the
  levels of p‐AKT Ser473) of ECs 24 h after induction of Pik3caH1047R expression.BVolcano
  plot of genes analysed by RNAseq in ECs upon Pik3caH1047R expression. Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) (P adj < 0.05) in Pik3caH1047R over Pik3caWT ECs at 24 h
  (grey, unchanged; orange, downregulated; purple, upregulated). n = 4 biological
  replicates per genotype.CPathway enrichment analysis showing most represented biological
  functions altered upon Pik3caH1047R expression in ECs.DImmunoblot showing the activation
  of PI3K/AKT pathway of Pik3caWT and Pik3caH1047R ECs after 2 h starvation (−) and
  30 min stimulation with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (+).E, F(E) Cell cycle analysis
  by flow cytometry of Pik3caWT and Pik3caH1047R ECs after cultured either without
  serum (−) or 20% serum (+) for 24 h. (F) Percentage of proliferative ECs (in S and
  G2 M phases) from Fig . Error bars are SEM. n ≥ 3 biological replicates per genotype.
  Statistical analysis was performed by nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. **P < 0.01
  and ****P < 0.0001 were considered statistically significant.  Source data are available
  online for this figure.
