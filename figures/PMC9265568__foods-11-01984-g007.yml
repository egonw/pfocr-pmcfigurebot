caption: Dietary grape powder supplementation shows enrichment for terms/pathways
  associated with translation in mouse liver irrespective of fat content. (A) KEGG
  pathway analysis showing the top significantly enriched terms for the gene set differentially
  expressed in the liver of the STD5GP group compared with the STD group. (B) KEGG
  pathway analysis showing the top significantly enriched terms for the gene set differentially
  expressed in the liver of the HFD5GP group compared with the HFD group. âˆ’log10(Padj)
  > 1.3 (Padj < 0.05) was considered as statistically significant enrichment. (C)
  Reactome pathway analysis showing the top significantly enriched terms for the gene
  set differentially expressed in the liver of the STD5GP group compared with the
  STD group. (D) Reactome pathway analysis showing the top significantly enriched
  terms for the gene set differentially expressed in the liver of the HFD5GP group
  compared with the HFD group. âˆ’log10(Padj) > 1.3 (Padj < 0.05) was considered as
  statistically significant enrichment.
