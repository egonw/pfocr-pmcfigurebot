caption: The role of gibberellin and salicylic acid cross-talk in mitigating salt
  stress in cotton. Salt stress induces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress triggers
  the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes cell death. ROS production
  is reduced by the supply of exogenously applied GA and SA. The overexpression of
  GASA genes and the exogenous supply of GA3 at the same time reverse salt stress
  which is further regulated by SA biosynthesis in plants due to the presence of GASA
  genes.
