caption: Circle plot and expression level of RESISTIN signaling pathway A-C. Circle
  plot of RESISTIN signaling in the healthy (A), pre-treatment (B), and post-treatment
  (C) groups, similar to Fig.  A‒C. The edge width corresponds to the strength of
  the ligand‒receptor pairsD. Relative contribution of ligand-receptor pairs for RESISTIN
  signaling pathwayE. Violin plot of RETN expression levels in monocytes. The horizontal
  line indicates the average in each group, and the asterisks denote the significance
  of the difference between groups calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.05
  (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001 (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****), p ≥ 0.05 (ns)F. Proportion
  of RETN+ monocytes in the healthy, pre- and post-treatment groupsG. Violin plot
  of RETN expression levels in mDCs. The horizontal line indicates the average in
  each group, and the asterisks denote the significance of the difference between
  groups calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**),
  p ≤ 0.001 (***), p ≤ 0.0001 (****), p ≥ 0.05 (ns)H. Proportion of RETN+ mDCs in
  the healthy, pre- and post-treatment groups
