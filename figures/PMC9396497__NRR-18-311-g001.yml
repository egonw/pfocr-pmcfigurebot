caption: 'Schematic representation of the interaction between the Rho/ROCK pathway
  and microRNAs in axon growth and apoptosis after spinal cord injury.Spinal cord
  injury triggers multiple signaling pathways that upregulate Rho/ROCK pathways in
  neurons, resulting in axon growth inhibition and neuronal apoptosis. By inhibiting
  certain parts of these signaling pathways, miR-135a-5p and miR-30b promote axonal
  regeneration. Wnt5a promotes neural differentiation of neural stem cells by inhibiting
  the Rho/ROCK pathway via miR-200b-3p. MiR-381 delivered by EV suppresses BRD4/Wnt5a
  axis and leads to inhibition of apoptosis through the inactivation of the Rho/ROCK
  pathway. BRD4: Bromodomain-containing protein 4; CSPG: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans;
  EV: extracellular vesicle; LAR: leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase; MAG:
  myelin-associated glycoprotein; MAI: myelin-associated inhibitor; NgR: Nogo receptor;
  NRP-1: neuropilin-1; OMgp: oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein; p75NTR: p75 neurotrophin
  receptor; PTPÏƒ: protein tyrosine phosphatase; RGM: repulsive guidance molecule;
  ROCK: Rho-kinase; Sema3A: semaphorin-3A; Wnt5a: Wnt family member 5a.'
