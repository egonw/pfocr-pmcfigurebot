caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs in four strains (C1, J45, C78, and J127)
  of C. geophilum after 2 mg/L Cd treatment as compared to the same strains cultured
  in normal conditions (0 mg/L Cd). Each symbol (circle, square, and triangle) in
  the figure represents a KEGG pathway, the ordinate indicates the name of the pathway,
  and the abscissa is the enrichment factor. The size of the symbol represents the
  numbers of DEGs involved in the corresponding pathways.
