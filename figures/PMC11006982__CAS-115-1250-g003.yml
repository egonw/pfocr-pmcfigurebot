caption: Linear mixed model analysis of hedgehog (Hh) signaling mRNA abundance in
  patients who achieved a disease modifying response (DMR) versus patients with no
  DMR. Participants who achieve DMR have lower Hh pathway signaling than participants
  who do not. Longitudinal analysis of transcriptomics data from bone marrow aspirate
  samples collected at screening, cycle 3 day 1, cycle 6 day 1, and cycle 9 day 1
  revealed a reduction in the Hh signaling Molecular Signatures Database hallmark
  gene set in participants who experienced DMR compared with participants who did
  not. Data for each participant are shown, and the vertical bars represent the mean ± SE
  at each visit.
