caption: Proposed pathway of TGFβ-hPMSCs regarding anti-adipogenesis in TAO. TGFβ-hPMSCs
  stimulate TGFβ signal transduction by binding to transmembrane receptors. The phosphorylated
  receptors transmit signaling by phosphorylating Smad 2/3 and inducing their binding
  to Smad 4. The Smad complex translocates into the nucleus and acts as transcription
  factors to inhibit lipogenic gene (e.g., HMGCR and SREBP2) and adipogenic gene (e.g.,
  PPARγ, C/EBPα, Leptin, and aP2) transcription, as well as fibrotic gene transcription,
  including a-SMA and Fibronectin.
