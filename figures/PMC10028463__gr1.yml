caption: The role of tRNA-derived fragment tRF-1001 in angiogenesis and endothelial
  sprouting(I) Downregulation of tRF-1001 could increase the expression of METTL3,
  which could cause methylation (m6A) of RBPJ and MAML1 mRNAs. This results in the
  YTHDF2-dependent degradation of methylated (m6A) mRNA, which would turn off the
  Notch signaling pathway and promote endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis.
  (II) Overexpression of tRF-1001 could silence the expression of METTL3, which would
  increase the expression of RBPJ and MAML1, turn on Notch signaling, and inhibit
  endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis.
