figure_title: Hh signaling in cancer
caption: (A) In ligand-independent group of cancers, Hh pathway components are mutated
  or amplified (as in the case of Gli), leading constitutive pathway activation. (B)
  In ligand-independent group of cancers, Hh derived from cancer cells act on stromal
  cells or cancer cells to regulate cancer progression. Cancer cells can also be regulated
  by Hh derived from stromal cells as in the case of lymphomas and multiple myelomas.
