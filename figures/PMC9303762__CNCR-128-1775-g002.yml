caption: Cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is overexpressed in tongue squamous cell
  carcinoma (TSCC) tissue and is associated with a poor prognosis. (A‐C) The levels
  of CDK5 in TSCC and adjacent normal tissue (ANT) were determined using the iOncomine
  database. CNS indicates central nervous system. (D) CDK5 protein expression in TSCC
  tissue and ANT was determined by Western blot analysis. Glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a reference standard. (E) Polymerase chain reaction
  detection of CDK5 messenger RNA levels in 8 pairs of TSCC tissue and ANT is shown.
  (F) Representative images illustrate immunohistochemical results for 136 TSCC samples.
  (G) Kaplan‐Meier analysis of overall survival is illustrated in 136 patients with
  TSCC stratified according to CDK5 expression.

  carcinoma through the microRNA 513c‐5p/cell division cycle 25B pathway and is associated
  with a poor prognosis.
