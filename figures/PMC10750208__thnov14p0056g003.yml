caption: 'ALT001 induces mitophagy through the ULK1-Rab9 alternative mitophagy pathway.
  (A) BEAS-2B cells were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for 12 h, and western blot analysis
  was performed using the indicated antibodies. Quantitative analysis of the protein
  levels shown on the right as the mean ± SD. (B) BEAS-2B cells expressing YFP-Rab9
  were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for 12 h. YFP-Rab9 puncta were analyzed by confocal
  microscopy, and cells with more than forty YFP-Rab9 puncta were considered positive
  cells. The percentage of Rab9 puncta-positive cells from three experiments is shown
  on the right as the mean ± SD (vehicle (Veh), n = 54; ALT001, n = 45). Scale bar:
  10 μm. (C) BEAS-2B cells expressing YFP-Rab9 were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for
  12 h and stained with MitoTracker Red. Fluorescence images were analyzed by confocal
  microscopy. Arrows indicate YFP-Rab9-containing mitochondria. Scale bar: 10 μm.
  The boxed regions are enlarged on the right. Scale bars: 5 μm (right enlarged).
  The number of YFP-Rab9 puncta-containing mitochondria per cell from three experiments
  is shown on the right as the mean ± SD (vehicle (Veh), n = 44; ALT001, n = 27).
  (D-E) BEAS-2B cells expressing mt-Keima (D) and BEAS-2B cells (E) were treated with
  ALT001 (15 μM) together with brefeldin A (BFA; 1 μg/ml) for 12 h, and mitophagy
  levels were analyzed by flow cytometry (D). Western blot analysis was performed
  using the indicated antibodies (E). Quantitative analysis of the protein levels
  shown on the right as the mean ± SD. (F-G) BEAS2B cells expressing shULK1 (F) or
  shRab9 (G) were treated with ALT001 (15 μM) for 12 h, and mitophagy levels were
  analyzed by flow cytometry. The results from three biological replicates (A, B,
  F, G) or four biological replicates (D) are shown as the mean ± SD. Significance
  was determined by Student''s t test (A, B, C) or two-way ANOVA (D, E, F, G) with
  Šidák''s multiple-comparison test. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. ****P < 0.0001. Numbers
  below the corresponding blot represent densitometric analysis normalized to Actin.
  Blots are representative of three to four biological replicates.'
