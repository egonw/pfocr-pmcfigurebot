caption: LIFR overexpression improves lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis. C57BL/6J
  mice were fed an NCD or HFD for 12 weeks. Mice were administrated with adenovirus
  containing GFP or LIFR through tail vein injection and sacrificed in a fed state
  at day 14 post injection (n = 5). A, illustration of the strategy used to achieve
  modulation of LIFR levels in liver. B and C, relative mRNA levels (B) and protein
  levels of LIFR (C) in the livers of Ad-GFP and Ad-LIFR mice. D and E, body weight
  (D) and liver weight (E) in two groups of HFD mice. F, representative H&E staining
  of liver sections (200 × magnification). G, liver TG contents in two groups of HFD
  mice. H, IPITT. Mice were fasted for 6 h before the experiment at day 5 post injection,
  and all mice were treated with intraperitoneal injection of 1 U/kg insulin. I, IPGTT.
  Mice were fasted for 16 h before the experiment at day 10 post injection, and all
  mice were treated with intraperitoneal injection of 1 g/kg glucose. J, relative
  mRNA levels of genes involved in de novo synthesis in two groups of mice. K, Western
  blot analysis of expression of STAT3, mTOR, AMPK, and JNK pathway in the livers
  of Ad-GFP and Ad-LIFR mice. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein;
  H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; HFD, high-fat diet; IPGTT, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance
  test; IPITT, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  LIFR, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; mTOR, mammalian target for rapamycin;
  NCD, normal chow diet; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
