caption: 'Statistical analyses of metabolomic data and transcriptomic data identified
  that 13 upregulated metabolites in the ApoE KO aorta were significantly correlated
  with 56 upregulated transcriptomic genes in the ApoE KO aorta. (A) The flow chart
  presented the strategy of cross-omic correlation. (B) The deliverable of correlation
  analysis identified that 13 upregulated metabolites in the ApoE KO aorta were significantly
  correlated with 56 upregulated transcriptomic genes in the ApoE KO aorta. (C) Metascape
  pathway analysis of all statistically positive correlated metabolite-genes partners
  (left) identified 7 innate immune and inflammation pathways, and the negative correlated
  metabolite-gene partners (right) indicated immune suppression pathway. *Abbviations
