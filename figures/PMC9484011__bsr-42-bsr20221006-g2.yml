figure_title: Biosynthetic pathway leading to H2S production from L- and D-cysteine
caption: 'L-cysteine is synthesized endogenously from methionine. It is converted
  to L-homocysteine that reacts with L-serine forming cystathionine in the reaction
  catalyzed by CBS. Cystathionine is then cleaved by CSE to L-cysteine and L-homoserine.
  L-cysteine is a substrate for reactions leading to H2S generation presented in .
  L-cysteine can be also a substrate for CAT, which results in the formation of 3-MP.
  The latter compound is a substrate for MST that temporarily creates a persulfide
  form and then H2S is released under the influence of reducing agents: Trxred or
  DHLA. The pathway of H2S synthesis from D-cysteine exists mainly in peroxisomes,
  where DAO converts it to 3-MP.'
