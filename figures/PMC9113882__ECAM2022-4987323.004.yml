caption: 'JP-Treated Serum inhibited TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway in HK-2 cells
  in vitro. (a) The protein bands of TGF-β1 and Smad2/3 in HK-2 cells stimulated by
  TGF-β1. (b, d) Quantitative analysis of protein expression alteration HK-2 cells
  stimulated by TGF-β1. ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the Control group. ##P < 0.01, compared
  with the TGF-β1 group; n = 3. (c) The mRNA expressions of TGF-β1, Smad2 and Smad3
  in HK-2 cells stimulated by TGF-β1. (e) The protein bands of TGF-β1 and Smad2/3
  in HK-2 cells induced by coculture of M2c macrophages. (f, g) Quantitative analysis
  of protein expression alteration HK-2 cells induced by coculture of M2c macrophages.
  ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the Control group; #P < 0.05 and ##∗∗P < 0.01, compared
  with the B group; n = 3.'
