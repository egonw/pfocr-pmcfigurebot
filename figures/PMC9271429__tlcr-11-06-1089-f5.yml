caption: The proteomic changes of PC-9 after STT3A knockout were detected by MS. We
  confirmed that STT3A regulates tumors through the Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.
  (A) The protein levels of 3 pairs of PC-9-sgSTT3A and PC-9-sgNC were detected by
  4D-label-free quantitative proteomics. Using 1/1.5 as the threshold of change, 1,121
  proteins were significantly downregulated and 1,194 were significantly upregulated.
  (B) A volcano map of changing proteins. (C) EGFR, CTK39, ARRB1 and other key proteins
  were downregulated in the top 40 heat maps of the changing proteins. (D) Among them,
  236 membrane proteins were significantly different. (E) GO enrichment analysis revealed
  changes in BP, cellular component, and molecular function, and the COG analysis
  revealed changes in cell cycle and cell signaling pathway. (F) The changes of the
  GO analysis in BPs were mainly concentrated in the cellular process, biological
  regulation, and mitochondrial metabolism. (G) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  showed that changes in STT3A knockout signaling pathways were enriched in NSCLC
  and the MAPK signaling pathways; the NSCLC signaling pathway included the AKT signaling
  pathway. (H) Total and phosphorylated forms of AKT, MEK, and ERK proteins were examined
  by immunoblot with indicated antibodies in transfected cell lines. (I) The inhibition
  of AKT and MAPK signals after STT3A inhibitor treatment was confirmed by Western
  blot; +, means cells were treated with NGI-1 (10 µM); −, means cells were treated
  with DMSO of the same volume as NGI-1. STT3A, STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase complex
