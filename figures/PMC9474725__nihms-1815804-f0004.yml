caption: Ripk2104Asp enhances NOD/RIPK2 signaling as well as expression of OA-associated
  markers of matrix remodeling in uninjured joints and joints with PTOA. Immunohistochemical
  detection of (A) Ripk2, (B) pNF-κB, (C) Mmp13, or (D) Col2 in WT and Ripk2104Asp
  mice 8 weeks following sham or DMM surgery. (A) Ripk2 is expressed at low levels
  in chondrocytes (arrows) of WT sham-, WT DMM-, and Ripk2104Asp sham-operated joints.
  In contrast, Ripk2 expression is highly elevated in chondrocytes in Ripk2104Asp
  knees following DMM surgery (arrows). (B) Activated NF-κB (pNF-κB) expression levels
  are higher in Ripk2104Asp sham-operated joints as compared to WT controls (arrows).
  The relatively increased Ripk2 expression is maintained in Ripk2104Asp joints following
  DMM surgery. (C) Mmp13 expression is elevated in chondrocytes of sham-operated Ripk2104Asp
  mice as compared to WT controls (arrows); the relatively increased expression Ripk2
  is maintained in Ripk2104Asp mice following DMM surgery (arrows). Furthermore, in
  the unoperated Ripk2104Asp joint, Mmp13 expression extends into deeper layers of
  cartilage, an expression domain normally only seen in WT joints following DMM surgery
  (brackets in C). (D) Col2 expression is reduced in Ripk2104Asp sham surgery mice
  relative to WT controls, and this loss is further exacerbated by DMM surgery (arrows).
  In regions with severe cartilage damage (arrowheads), pNF-κB, Mmp13, and Col2 expression
  is low in both WT and Ripk2104Asp DMM-operated joints. Images are of selected regions
  of the medial tibial condyle (see ). (E) Quantification of the number of Ripk2,
  pNF-κB, Mmp13, and Col2 positive chondrocytes in the medial knee joint of WT sham,
  Ripk2Asp104 sham, WT DMM, and Ripk2Asp104 DMM mice. n = 3 independent animals for
  each experimental condition. Error bars represent ±SD and statistically significant
  differences of P ≤ 0.01 (**), P ≤ 0.001 (***), and P ≤ 0.0001 (****) were determined
  by two-way ANOVA with Tukey‟s multiple comparisons test.
