caption: Effects of the FAT10 overexpression and PI3K/AKT inhibition on mitochondria-mediated
  energy metabolism in hypoxia-stimulated H9C2 cells. (a) Detection of H9C2 cells
  by using flow cytometry revealed decreased MMP levels. (b) Transmission electron
  microscopy images of mitochondrial ultrastructure in H9C2 cells. (c) Expression
  of proteins associated with mitochondrial fission and fusion in H9C2 cells by using
  Western blot. Levels of (d) ATP, (e) glucose, (f), and lactic acid in H9C2 cells.
  Data are represented to be mean ± SD, n = 3, ∗p < 0.05.
