caption: Effect of inflammatory stimulation on transient receptor potential vanilloid
  1 (TRPV1) and PI3K/AKT in vitro. (A) The mRNA levels of TRPV1, TNF-α, and IL-1β
  in HPDLCs of the LPS (lipopolysaccharide) PBS and control groups were detected by
  real-time PCR. (B) Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of
  TRPV1, PI3K, phospho-PI3K, Akt, phospho-Akt, IL-1β, and GAPDH. (C) Analysis of the
  protein expression levels of TRPV1 and IL-1β relative to GAPDH. (D) Analysis of
  PI3K and AKT phosphorylation levels. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. *P<0.05, * *P<0.01, * * * P<0.001, ns = no significant
  difference
