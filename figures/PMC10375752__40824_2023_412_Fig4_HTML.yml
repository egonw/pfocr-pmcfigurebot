caption: 'PEG-CNPs counteract oxidative stress via activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling
  pathway. Relative mRNA expressions of DJ-1 a, Nrf2 b, and Keap1 c in HT-29 cells
  after different treatments. d Schematic diagram of the experimental protocol to
  evaluate the role of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (SiRNA) in vitro using qRT-PCR
  analysis and flow cytometry. e Relative mRNA expressions of Nrf2 in SiNrf2-transfected
  HT-29 cells. f Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in SiNrf2-transfected HT-29
  cells. g Apoptosis rate of HT-29 cells. h The anti-oxidative genes (Nqo1, Gpx1,
  HO-1) and i pro-oxidative genes (Nox-2, Cyp2e1) expression levels in HT-29 cells
  treated with PEG-CNPs and H2O2. Relative mRNA expressions of HO-1 j and Nox-2 k.
  l Schematic representation of the mechanism of PEG-CNPs in reducing ROS level. PEG-CNPs
  decompose DDP-induced H2O2 into H2O and O2. Meanwhile, the minimally residual ROS
  activate the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Specifically, Nrf2 moves into the nucleus
  and subsequently binds to the antioxidant response elements (ARE), leading to the
  upregulation of the antioxidant gene (HO-1) and downregulation of the pro-oxidant
  gene (Nox-2). These gene regulations can further detoxify ROS. Data represent means ± s.d.
