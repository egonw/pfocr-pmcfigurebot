caption: Validation of 21 selected DEGs. (A) Schematic representation of choosing
  DEGs for qPCR validation. (B) Volcano plot represents previously identified targets
  of HH-GLI signaling in red and targets selected for validation in this study in
  blue for each GLI protein. (C) Heatmap showing qPCR validation of GLI target genes
  identified by both ChIP-seq and RNA-seq on seven melanoma cell lines (A375, SKMEL24,
  MEL224, SKMEL2, MEL505, CHL-1 and MEWO) with overexpressed GLI1, GLI2 or GLI3. The
  experiment was repeated two times in triplicates. Validation was performed for 21
  DEGs and two known pathway targets PTCH1 and GLI1 as controls. The relative expression
  level of each gene was determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method with RPLP0 as the internal
  reference gene. Heatmap shows log2 fold change values, ND stating that expression
  levels could not be detected after 37th cycle.
