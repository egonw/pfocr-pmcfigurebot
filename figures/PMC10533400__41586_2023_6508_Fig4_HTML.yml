caption: a, Heat map showing unsupervised hierarchical clustering of DEGs following
  bulk RNA-seq of FICZ-treated HUVECs compared with HUVECs treated with vehicle (n = 5
  per group). b, Enrichment plots showing GSEA using HUVEC-specific proliferation
  and quiescence gene sets. Tested gene sets were from ref. . c, Flow cytometric cell
  cycle analysis of HUVECs treated with 100 nM FICZ (n = 4 replicates) compared with
  DMSO vehicle control (n = 5 replicates). d, Schematic of cell cycle regulators (created
  with BioRender.com). e, Single-cell imaging of cell cycle regulators in HUVECs treated
  with 100 nM FICZ (+) or vehicle (−). Symbols represent mean expression from individual
  wells (n = 6–24). f, HUVECs were treated with 100 nM FICZ (for 2 h), followed by
  LPS stimulation (for 4 h) and profiled for expression of AHR pathway genes and endothelial
  inflammatory markers by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Data are representative of 3 independent
  experiments. Bar height shows mean throughout. P values calculated by two-way ANOVA
  with Šidák’s multiple comparisons tests (c), unpaired t-tests (e) and one-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests (f).
