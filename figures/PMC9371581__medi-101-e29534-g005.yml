caption: The results of the GO enrichment analysis and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment
  analysis. (A) The GO enrichment analysis of BYHWD candidate targets for LDH treatment.
  The horizontal axis of the bubble chart represents the gene ratio, the vertical
  axis represents the name of GO, and the corresponding bubble represents enriched
  gene counts. The smaller the q value, the redder the color, and the higher the significance
  of enrichment. (B) The KEGG analysis of candidate targets of BYHWD for LDH treatment.
  The horizontal axis of the bubble chart represents the gene ratio, the vertical
  axis represents the name of the signaling pathway, and the corresponding bubble
  represents enriched gene counts. The smaller the q value, the redder the color,
  and the higher the significance of enrichment. (C) The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
  BYHWD = Buyang Huanwu decoction, GO = Gene Ontology, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes, LDH = lumbar disc herniation.

  of lumbar disc herniation based on network pharmacology and molecular docking.
