caption: LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in CAVD. (A) The differential mRNAs involved in
  extracellular matrix-receptor interaction were constructed the complementary endogenous
  networks. The up-regulated mRNAs (B) and down-regulated mRNAs (C) separately were
  constructed the complementary endogenous networks. The blue nodes indicate the up-regulated
  mRNAs involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interaction pathway, the yellow
  nodes indicate the down-regulated mRNAs, the violet nodes represent the hub miRNAs
  and the magenta nodes indicate the lncRNAs.
