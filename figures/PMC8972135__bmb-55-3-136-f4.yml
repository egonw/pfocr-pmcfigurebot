caption: 'Effects of PN-101 on NFκB signaling pathway. PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages
  were pre-treated with PN-101 for 1 h and then exposed to 1 μg/ml LPS. (A) Immunodetection
  of phosphorylated NFκB and IκB was performed by western blotting. PN-101 inhibited
  LPS induced phosphorylation of IκB and NFκB. (B) Densitometric analysis of immunodetection
  results in  was expressed in arbitrary units (#P < 0.05 vs. control, ###P < 0.001
  vs. control, *P < 0.05 vs. LPS, ***P < 0.001 vs. LPS). (C) Localization of NFκB
  was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging. The image shows that
  NFκB (green color) is localized in the nucleus of THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS,
  while it remains mostly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. PN-101 abolished
  LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB. PN-101 in red and DAPI nuclear staining
  in blue. Scale bar, 10 μm. The image shown is representative of at least three independent
  experiments. (D) PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages were transfected with a luciferase
  gene construct driven by nine copies of NFκB response element upstream of the TK
  promoter. Transfected cells were pre-treated with PN-101 for 1 h and then exposed
  to 1 μg/ml LPS. The basal level of luciferase activity was set to be 1 (**P < 0.01
  vs. LPS). PN-101 decreased NFκB trans- activity. (E) Intracellular calcium concentration
  was measured with a calcium specific dye Fluo-4 AM. Values are expressed as mean
  ± SD. #P < 0.05 vs. control group; *P < 0.05 vs. LPS).'
