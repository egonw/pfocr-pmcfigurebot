caption: 'Combination of anti-TRPM7 shRNA and cisplatin enhances cytotoxicity in ALDH+
  HNSCC cells. (A) Box-plot diagrams of the relationship of TRPM7 expression with
  cisplatin sensitivity/resistance according to the GEO dataset GSE117872. (B) Significant
  inhibitory effect of the combination of TRPM7 shRNA and cisplatin on tumorspheres.
  (C) Wound healing analysis by using cells transfected with TRPM7 shRNA and cisplatin
  in SAS and FaDu cells. (D) Association of TRPM7 with possible regulatory pathways
  in Western blot assays. (E) Apoptosis analysis of SAS and FaDu cells with or without
  TRPM7 shRNA.*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. Scale bar: 100 Î¼m.'
