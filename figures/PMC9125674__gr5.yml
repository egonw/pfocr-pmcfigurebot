caption: Effects of molsidomine (MS, 0.1 mM) and L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME,
  18.5 mM) treatments on protein synthesis rate and phosphorylation of mTOR and protein
  S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K) in breast and thigh muscles of broilers. (A) Protein synthesis
  rate in breast muscle; (B) total and phosphorylated mTOR in breast muscle; (C) total
  and phosphorylated p70S6K in breast muscle; (D) protein synthesis rate in thigh
  muscle; (E) total and phosphorylated mTOR in thigh muscle; (F) total and phosphorylated
  p70S6K in thigh muscle. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6); ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01.
