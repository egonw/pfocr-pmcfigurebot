caption: 'Effects of trans-anethole on the protein expression of NF-κB pathway in
  the liver of LPS-challenged broilers. The values are represented as mean (n = 4)
  with their standard errors. Bars with unlike letters means significantly different.
  Abbreviations: NF-κB p65, nuclear factor kappa B p65; IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κB alpha.
  CON, control group fed with basal diet and treated with saline; LPS, group fed with
  basal diet and treated with lipopolysaccharide; LPS+TA400, group fed with 400 mg/kg
  trans-anethole and treated with lipopolysaccharide; LPS+TA600, group fed with 600
  mg/kg trans-anethole and treated with lipopolysaccharide.'
article_title: Trans-anethole ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute liver inflammation
  in broilers via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway.
