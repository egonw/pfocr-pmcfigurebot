caption: SFTSV activates IFN production and cytokine storm to evade the innate immune
  response. SFTSV RNAs bind to TLR-3 and RIG-1 to activate TRIF, TBK1 and IKK, which
  in turn activate the NF-κB signaling pathway whilst phosphorylating IRF3 and IRF7.
  This induces the expression of cytokine, type I and type III IFN genes, promoting
  the production of inflammatory cytokines, type I and III IFNs. Type I and III IFNs
  can share the same JAK/STAT pathway by binding to their receptors, which activate
  the expression of ISGs and antiviral proteins that inhibit viral replication. SFTSV
  NSs can bind several host proteins to form inclusion bodies, such as RIG-I, TBK1,
  IKK, IRF3, IRF7, TRIM25, STAT1 and STAT2, leading to severe clinical implications.
  Red lines indicate inhibition. SFTSV, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
