caption: Effects on the liver neoglucogenic pathway of carob syrup mixed in drinking
  water at a dose of 100 mg/kg D-Pinitol per day of study with repeated administration
  for 10 days. Panels depict the quantitative expression of mRNA coding for (A) actin
  B (Actb, housekeeping gene), (B) pyruvate kinase (Pklr), (C) pyruvate carboxylase
  (PC), (D) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) (E) fructose bis phosphatase
  (Fbp1), and (F) the catalytic subunit of glucose-6 phosphatase (G6pc). Data are
  means Â± standard errors of the mean of at least 8 determinations per group. (*)
  p < 0.05, (**) p < 0.01 carob syrup vs. water drinking control animals.
