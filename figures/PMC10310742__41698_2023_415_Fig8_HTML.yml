figure_title: Cellular communication analysis in aneuploid between the high score
  group and the low score group
caption: a t-SNE plot showing the subpopulation analysis of the TILs. b Bubble plot
  of the average and ratio expression of marker genes in different TILs subtypes.
  c Circos plots displaying putative ligand-receptor interactions between osteoblastic
  cells and other TILs cell clusters from the low ANGcore (left) and high ANGscore
  (right) group in VEGF signalling pathway. d Circos plots displaying putative ligand-receptor
  interactions between osteoblastic cells and other TILs cell clusters from the low
  ANGcore (left) and high ANGscore (right) group in ANGPTL signalling pathway. e Bubble
  plot showing the receptor-ligand binding interactions from osteoblastic cells to
  other cell clusters in the low ANGcore (left) and high ANGscore (right) group. f
  Circos plots displaying putative ligand-receptor interactions between osteoblastic
  cells and other TILs cell clusters from the low ANGcore (left) and high ANGscore
  (right) group in IGF-Î³ signalling pathway. g Bubble plot showing the receptor-ligand
  binding interactions from TILs subtypes to osteoblastic cells in the low ANGcore
  (left) and high ANGscore (right) group.
