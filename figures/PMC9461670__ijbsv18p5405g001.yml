caption: Two different modes of IL‑6 signaling. IL-6 can bind to both mIL‑6R (classic
  signaling) and sIL-6R (trans-signaling). After homodimerization of the signal-transducing
  receptor subunit gp130 on the plasma membrane, the two signaling pathways converge,
  triggering the intracellular JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling cascades. SOCS is the product
  of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway activation and is also a protein associated with
  the negative-feedback reaction that leads to the inhibition of this signaling pathway.
