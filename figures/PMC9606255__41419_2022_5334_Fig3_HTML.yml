figure_title: TAB182 regulates the β-catenin signaling pathway via affecting the nuclear
  translocation of β-catenin
caption: A volcano plot showing differential expressed genes between shNC and shTAB182
  TE-10 cells. B RNA transcriptome data was reanalyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
  NES = −1.52, P < 0.05. C Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel of co-immunoprecipitation
  products of TAB182. The MS/MS spectra show the presence of peptide peaks corresponding
  to the β-catenin sequence (LVQLLVR). D co-immunoprecipitation was performed by using
  TAB182 and β-catenin antibody, and the IP product was analyzed by immunoblotting.
  E western blotting analysis of the indicated total β-catenin and phosphorylated
  β-catenin proteins. F western blotting analysis of nuclear expression of β-catenin
  in TAB182 knockdown and overexpressed cells. G immunofluorescence staining of nucleus
  location of β-catenin in TE-10-shNC and TE-10-shTAB182 cells, KYSE-150-shNC and
  KYSE-150-shTAB182 cells. H, I immunoprecipitation detection of interaction between
  β-catenin and GSK3β in TAB182 decreased and overexpressed ESCC cells.
article_title: TAB182 aggravates progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  by enhancing β-catenin nuclear translocation through FHL2 dependent manner.
