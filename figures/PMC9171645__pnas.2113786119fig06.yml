caption: Model of the Stalk TA-mediated activation signaling of the PC1 CTF. (A) A
  “Closed” low-energy conformation is identified for the WT CTF, in which signal is
  transduced through an allosteric pathway connecting the Stalk–TOP–PL domains and
  ultimately to the C-tail for G protein activation. (B) Stalk variants (including
  ΔStalk, G3052R, and R3063C) of CTF adopt a distinct “Open” conformation, which exhibits
  reduced residue interactions between the Stalk–TOP domains and broken salt bridge
  interaction of residues R3848 and E4078 between the TOP–PL domains, leading to significantly
  reduced signaling activity of these PC1 mutants.
