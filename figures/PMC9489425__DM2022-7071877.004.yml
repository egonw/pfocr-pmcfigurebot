caption: The miRNA expression profile between ADSC-Exos and SC-Exos. (a) The distribution
  of the differentially expressed miRNAs of ADSC-Exos and SC-Exos in a volcano plot.
  (b) The top 20 significant KEGG pathway terms sorted by rich factor. (c) Heatmap
  of 10 miRNAs with high expression in mTOR signaling pathway predicted by sequencing
  and TargetScan sofeware. (d) Binding sites of miR-22-3p and Pten predicted by TargetScan
  software. ADSC-Exos, the exosomes extracted from Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem
  cells; SC-Exos, the exosomes extracted from Schwann cells; miR, miRNA.
article_title: Exosomes Derived from Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells Carrying miRNA-22-3p
  Promote Schwann Cells Proliferation and Migration through Downregulation of PTEN.
