caption: (A) Western blot bands of JAK2 and STAT3 respectively of deltamethrin, S/DM
  Nps and CS/DM Nps orally administered for 30 days. The expression of Î²-actin acts
  as loading control. (B) Western blot of expression pattern of JAK2 and STAT3 respectively
  of deltamethrin, S/DM Nps and CS/DM Nps orally administered for 30 days. Quantitative
  data are expressed in relative intensity arbitrary units. The bar represents the
  standard deviation of the mean. The different superscript letters in each group
  indicated a significant difference between groups at level p < 0.05.
