caption: Hippo pathway effectors YAP, TAZ and TEAD4 are overexpressed in hypertrophic
  scars and keloids. Representative cases of control skin (upper panel), hypertrophic
  scars (middle panel) and keloids (lower panel) showed stronger immunopositivity
  in fibroblasts for YAP, TAZ and TEAD4 in keloids compared to scars (magnification
  40×). Scale bar set at 20 μm (ImageJfiji software).
