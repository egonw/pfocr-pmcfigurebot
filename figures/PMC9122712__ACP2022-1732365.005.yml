caption: Effect of miR-585-3p targeting FSCN1 on protein phosphorylation of ERK. (a)
  Western blot test was used to detect the changes of p-ERK, ERK, and FSCN1 protein
  expression in SKOV3 cells of each group. (b) Western blot test was used to detect
  the changes of p-ERK, ERK, and FSCN1 protein expression in SW626 cells of each group.
