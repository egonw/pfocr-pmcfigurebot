caption: RACGAP1 knockdown inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in A549 cells.
  A549 cells were transfected with si-Ctrl or si-RACGAP1. Protein levels of PI3K,
  p-AKT, and AKT after RACGAP1 knockdown were determined using Western blot analysis.
  Representative images are shown and quantitated using ImageLab software. GAPDH was
  used as an internal control. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl.

  signaling pathway.
