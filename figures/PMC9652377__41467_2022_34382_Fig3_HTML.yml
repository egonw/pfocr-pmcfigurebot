figure_title: CXCR4 association and Gi activation
caption: 'a (Left) Schematic representation of the CXCR4 dimerization BRET-based assay.
  (Right) CXCR4 association was measured by BRET before (black) and after agonist
  stimulation (gray) in HEK293T cells transfected with CXCR4-RLuc and its counterpart
  CXCR4-YFP, WT, or mutant as indicated. BRET480-YFP was measured after the addition
  of coel-h (10 min) and CXCL12 (15 min). Data shown represent the mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments and are expressed as net BRET (calculated by subtracting
  background luminescence). Statistical significance was assessed using a two-way
  ANOVA followed by a Šídák’s multiple comparisons test: #p = 0.007, ##p < 0.0001,
  n.s. not significant p > 0.05 are used to compare BRET values between basal to CXCL12-treated
  conditions and †p = 0.0004, ††p < 0.0001 are used to compare basal BRET values between
  the mutants. b (Left) Schematic representation of the BRET-based ligand-induced
  Gi activation assay. (Right) CXCL12-promoted Gi activation measured by BRET in HEK293T
  cells transfected with HA-CXCR4, WT or mutant as indicated, Gαi1-RLucII, Gβ1, and
  Gγ2-GFP10. BRET400-GFP10 was measured after the addition of coel-400a (10 min) and
  CXCL12 (3 min). c (Left) Schematic representation of the BRET-based EPAC sensor
  to measure cAMP production. (Right) CXCL12-promoted EPAC inhibition was measured
  by BRET in HEK293T cells transfected with HA-CXCR4, WT or mutant as indicated, and
  RLuc-EPAC-YFP. BRET480-YFP, reporting the conformation rearrangement of the EPAC
  sensor from an open to a closed conformation, was measured after the addition of
  coel-h (10 min) and CXCL12 (5 min). b, c CXCR4 mutations predicted to stabilize
  the open-dimer or the closed-dimer conformation are annotated with a blue or red
  dimer symbol, respectively. Data shown represent the mean ± SEM of at least three
  independent experiments and are expressed as ΔBRET (agonist-promoted BRET).'
