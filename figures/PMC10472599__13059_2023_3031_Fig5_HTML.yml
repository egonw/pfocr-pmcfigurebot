caption: 'Characterization of the CD69+ HSC-like cell subpopulation potentially conferring
  chemoresistance. a Heatmap displaying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pre-therapy
  HSC-like populations between resistant cases (P105 and P116) and sensitive cases
  (P115, P106, P118, P119, and P120). b Bar plot presenting representative suppressed
  biological functions enriched by DEGs in panel a using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). c GSEA plots showing the enrichment of quiescence, proliferation, adhesion
  (KEGG term: cell adhesion molecules), and migration (KEGG term: leukocyte transendothelial
  migration) signatures in HSC-like cells from resistant cases compared to sensitive
  cases. d Dot plots of normalized expression of differentially expressed surface
  marker genes between resistant and sensitive cases. Dot size represents the proportion
  of cells expressing a gene in a patientâ€™s HSC-like cell population, and shading
  indicates the relative expression level. e Violin plots depicting CD69 expression
  in HSC-like populations from patients and HSC populations from healthy donors. f
  Regulatory network showing upstream regulators and their targets predicted to be
  activated or suppressed in HSC-like cells from resistant cases. Colors indicate
  increased (red) or decreased (green) gene expression relative to sensitive cases.
  Red and blue lines represent known activating or inhibitory effects, respectively,
  between each regulator and its targets'
