caption: A4B17 action in different cancer cell lines(A) Clonogenic cell survival assay
  showing representative images of the colonies formed in control and BAG1L KO LNCaP
  cells following treatment with the indicated concentrations of A4B17.(B) Quantification
  of the colonies of three different experiments each with three biological replicates.
  The results are presented relative to the colonies formed in the vehicle-treated
  samples which was set at 100% (n = 9) and are the averages ±SEM.(C) Quantification
  of the colonies formed by the different cell lines after treatment with the indicated
  concentrations of A4B17. The results are presented relative to the colonies formed
  in the vehicle-treated samples which was set at 100% (n = 3) and are the averages ±SEM.(D–F)
  MTT assay to determine the effect of the indicated concentrations of enzalutamide
  or A4B17 on the viability of LNCaP (n = 3), 22Rv.1 cell (n = 4; n.d. not determinable)
  and LAPC-4 (n = 7) cells. The IC50 results are the averages ±SEM. Also see .
