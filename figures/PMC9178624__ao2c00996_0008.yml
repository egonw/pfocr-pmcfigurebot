caption: 'Effect of pretreatment with the RhoA inhibitor C3TF or the ROCK inhibitor
  Y27632 on H2S-induced relaxation of rat cerebral basilar artery vascular smooth
  muscle cells (VSMCs) (mean ± SD, n = 6). (a) Identification of primary cultured
  rat cerebral basilar artery VSMCs. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-α-SMA antibody
  and phosphate buffer solution (PBS). α-SMA exhibited green fluorescence in the cytoplasm,
  and nuclei stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) presented blue fluorescence.
  (b) Relaxation of resting VSMCs. (c) Relaxation of KCl-precontracted VSMCs. C3TF:
  1.0 μg/mL, Y27632: 10 μmol/L. **P < 0.01 vs the vehicle group; #P < 0.05, ##P <
  0.01 vs the PSS pretreatment group.'
