caption: '6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, daunorubicin, and cytarabine induce the
  P53 pathway activation. (a) Western blot analysis of P53 and RPL11 after 24 h of
  drug treatment in NALM6 cells and 48 h of drug treatment in RS4;11 cells transfected
  with scrambled siRNA or RPL11 siRNA#1 or #2. GAPDH levels were used as a loading
  control. Each cell was treated with 100 μM 6-MP, 100 nM MTX, 10 nM DNR, and 100
  nM AraC for NALM6 cells as well as with 10 μM 6-MP, 100 nM MTX, 3 nM DNR, and 3
  nM AraC for RS4;11 cells. (b) P53 target gene mRNA expression was measured via reverse
  transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Each cell was treated with the same concentration
  of each drug as Western blot for 24 h in NALM6 cells and 48 h in RS4;11 cells. Reactions
  were carried out in triplicate. The blue bar indicates cells with transfected scramble
  siRNA; the red bar indicates the cells transfected with RPL11 siRNA. Error bars
  represent standard deviation (* p-value < 0.05; ** p-value < 0.005; *** p-value
  < 0.001; **** p-value < 0.0001). 6-MP, 6-mercaptopurine; AraC, cytarabine; DNR,
  daunorubicin; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; L11#1, RPL11 siRNA#1; L11#2, RPL11 siRNA#2;
  MTX, methotrexate; Scr, scrambled siRNA.'
