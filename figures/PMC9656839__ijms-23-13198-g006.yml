caption: 14-3-3ζ/δ–PGAM2 interaction depends on the insulin/IGF1–PI3K signaling pathway.
  PGAM2 (A) and 14-3-3ζ/δ (B) are not present in the nucleus when cells are cultured
  in serum-depleted medium or in the presence of PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Similarly,
  the interaction between these proteins (C) is almost completely abolished in the
  above conditions.
