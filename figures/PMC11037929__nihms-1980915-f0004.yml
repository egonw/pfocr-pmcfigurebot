figure_title: Metabolic profiles of shop mutants reared in different diets
caption: (A) Principal-component analysis (PCA) for metabolite levels in shop and
  control larvae reared on 100% or 0% Cys diet. Each dataset includes five replicates
  of 25 pooled larvae per replicate.(B) Levels (log2(fold change) compared to control
  - 100% Cys) of ISOD-associated metabolites thiosulfate, S-sulfocysteine, and glutathione-sulfite.(C
  and D) Cumulative pupariation (%) and egg-to-adult survivorship (%) of shop and
  controls reared on 0% Cys diet supplemented with (C) 2 mM sodium sulfite or (D)
  2.5 mM sodium thiosulfate. Data points represent the mean of each time point with
  error bars equal to one standard error. Five replicate vials were tested per diet
  and genotype, with 20 individuals per replicate.(E) Sulfur-amino acid catabolism
  pathway, metabolite responses to diet in shop mutants. Levels (log2(fold change)
  compared to control - 100% Cys) of sulfur-amino acid catabolism metabolites detected
  by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). shop and controls were reared
  on complete (100% Cys) or cysteine-free (0% Cys) diets. Five replicates were performed
  per diet and genotype, with 10 individuals per replicate.(F) Levels (log2(fold change)
  compared to control - 100% Cys) of energy metabolism metabolites alanine, pyruvate,
  and lactate and the relative proportions NADH/NAD and ATP/ADP + AMP.(B, E, and F)
  Boxplots show minimum and maximum values, quartile values, and the median. Multiple
  comparison one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s HSD. Capital letters above columns designate
  distinct significance groups (groups with the same letter are not significantly
  different from one another, while groups with different letters are significantly
  different, p < 0.05).
