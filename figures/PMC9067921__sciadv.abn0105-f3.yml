figure_title: Extensive coevolution in DNA replication genes
caption: (A) Cartoon representation of DNA replication. Exemplary complex specific
  subnetworks are depicted in (B) to (D). (B) Extensive coevolution between orthologous
  genes that encode the helicase, minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which
  functions as a helicase. (C) Coevolution in the orthologous genes that encode the
  DNA polymerase α-primase complex and (D) DNA polymerase ε complex, which are responsible
  for RNA primer synthesis and leading strand DNA synthesis, respectively. Edges in
  blue connect orthologous genes that are significantly coevolving. Orthologous genes
  and complexes in bold have signatures of coevolution. Orthologous genes and complexes
  are colored according to orthologous gene community assignment. Complexes, such
  as the DNA polymerase α-primase complex, are depicted in multiple colors reflecting
  the multiple orthologous gene communities represented within the complex. There
  is significant coevolution across all DNA replication orthologous genes (P < 0.001;
  permutation test) as well as the multimeric complexes such as the MCM complex (P
  < 0.001 for each pathway; permutation test).
