caption: Interference of ITGB3 expression decreased the phosphorylation of FAK-MAPK
  pathway in Jurkat cells. (a) The total protein expression level and phosphorylation
  level of FAK, cRAF, MEK and ERK1/2 in Jurkat (ctrl), sh-NC and sh-ITGB3 cells detected
  by immunoblot. The expression of actin was applied as internal control. (b) The
  column graph of relative expression level of phosphorylation of FAK, cRAF, MEK and
  ERK1/2 in Jurkat (ctrl), sh-NC and sh-ITGB3 cells detected by immunoblot. The relative
  expression levels were calculated by the ratio of density of phosphorylation band
  and total protein band. (c) The total protein expression level and phosphorylation
  level of FAK, cRAF, MEK and ERK1/2 in control (ctrl) and Jurkat cells treated with
  ITGB3 antibodies (anti-ITGB3). The expression level was detected by immunoblot.
