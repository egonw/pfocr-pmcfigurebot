caption: 'RNA sequencing analysis of PheC-related genes and genes of the shikimic
  pathway (which produces important substrates for PheC synthesis): Annotated genes
  are listed in rows from the top to the bottom in order of involvement in the biosynthetic
  pathways, whilst comparisons among light treatments are listed in columns (BH compared
  to GH, BH compared to RH, and BH compared to BL). Gray color denotes a missing value
  (in at least one of the datasets, the transcript was either not present or was excluded
  due to the parameters listed in ). Displayed values correspond to logs of relative
  fold changes of gene expression (LogFC) between treatments and are also indicated
  by color according to the presented color scale. Specifications of light treatments:
  B (blue), R (red), G (green), L (low irradiance, 100 µmol m−2 s−1), and H (high
  irradiance, 400 µmol m−2 s−1). DAHP (3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate
  synthase; MLOC_17364.2), ESPS (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase; MLOC_56626.1),
  CS (chorismate synthase; MLOC_66898.1), ADT (arogenate dehydratase; MLOC_65725.1),
  PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase; MLOC_79728.1), CHS1 (chalcone synthase isoform
  1; MLOC_74116.1), CHS/SSfp (chalcone/stilbene synthase family protein; MLOC_7936.1),
  CH/SSfp (chalcone/stilbene synthases family protein; MLOC_64305.2), CHIfp (chalcone-flavonone
  isomerase family protein; MLOC_5324.1), and C/Fifp (chalcone/flavonone family protein;
  MLOC_80571.3). MLOC IDs are unique identifiers in the STRING database (https://string-db.org/,
