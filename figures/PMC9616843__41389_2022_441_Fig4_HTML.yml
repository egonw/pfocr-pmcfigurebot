figure_title: ARHGAP5 is the direct downstream target of DUSP5P1
caption: 'A Analysis of DUSP5P1 location. A1: DUSP5P1 was mainly located in the nucleus
  of GC cells by RT-PCR after nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation. A2: Representative
  images of nuclear localization of DUSP5P1 in GC tissues by RNA FISH. A Nuclear localization
  of DUSP5P1 in DUSP5P1 overexpressed BGC823, GES1 and MGC803 cells following DUSP5P1
  transfection by RNA FISH. B Flow chart of ChIRP-sequencing assay and RNA-sequencing
  data analysis of binding site for DUSP5P1 to select the direct downstream target
  genes of DUSP5P1. C The function and pathway enrichment of DUSP5P1 regulated target
  genes. D Downstream targets of DUSP5P1 identified by ChIRP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing.
  D1: The enrichment fold change of even and odd probes by ChIRP-sequencing and D2:
  the corresponding change of mRNA expression, respectively. E Validation of DUSP5P1
  and binding target region of the downstream genes. E1: Representative visual images
  of enrichment feature of the target regions; E2: ChIRP-PCR was performed to determine
  the interaction between DUSP5P1 and target region of the downstream genes. F Motif
  analysis of target sequence by ChIRP-sequencing. G Analysis of motif ARHGAP5 binded.
  G1: The binding region and the motif analysis of the ARHGAP5 gene. G2: Luciferase
  reporter assay showed that DUSP5P1 binds to the “TATGTG” motif. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001.'
