figure_title: ATF3 can promote the malignant phenotype of GSCs via activating TGF-β1/Smad2
  signaling
caption: 'a Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that high expression of ATF3
  is positively associated with the TGF-β signaling pathway through data from the
  TCGA and CGGA datasets. (CGGA: p < 0.01; TCGA: p = 0.011). b ELISA assays detected
  the secretion of TGF-β1 after ATF3 knockdown or overexpression. (GSC38: p < 0.001;
  GSC35: p < 0.001; One-Way ANOVA). c The expression of circRPPH1 after ATF3 knockdown
  or overexpression with TGF-β1 or LY2109761 was detected by qPCR. (GSC38: p < 0.001;
  GSC35: p < 0.001; One-Way ANOVA). d Western blotting showed that ATF3-KD mediated
  the less expression of p-smad2 and p-smad3, while ATF3-OE elevated them. e MTS assays
  showed that the cell viability of ATF3-KD GSCs was improved by TGF-β1 treatment.
  And LY2109761 could inhibit the cell viability of ATF3-OE GSCs. (GSC38: p < 0.01;
  GSC35: p < 0.01; One-Way ANOVA). f, g, i EdU assays and Transwell assays showed
  the proliferation and invasion abilities of ATF3-KD GSCs were enhanced under TGF-β1
  treatment. LY2109761 inhibited them in ATF3-OE GSCs Scale bar = 100 μm. (GSC38:
  p < 0.001; GSC35: p < 0.001; One-Way ANOVA). h, j Neurospheres formation assays
  and extreme limiting dilution analysis revealed that the sphere-forming and self-renewing
  capacity of ATF3-KD GSCs were enhanced under TGF-β1 treatment. LY2109761 could inhibit
  them in ATF3-OE GSCs Scale bar = 100 μm. (GSC38, kd vs. nc: p = 0.00621, kd vs.
  kd+TGFβ1: p = 0.0011; kd+DMSO vs. kd+ TGFβ1: p = 0.00228; GSC35, oe vs. ev: p = 0.0259,
  oe vs. oe+ LY2109761: p = 0.00534, oe+DMSO vs. oe+ LY2109761: p = 0.0184; ELDA analysis;
  circles represent corresponding points, triangles mean the point is outside of the
  log fraction number wells). k Western blotting showed that the stemness markers
  expression in ATF3-KD GSCs was upregulated by TGF-β1 treatment. And LY2109761 could
  inhibit the expression in ATF3-OE GSCs. All results are obtained as the mean ± SD
  under at least biological triplicate assays. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
