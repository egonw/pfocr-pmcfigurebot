caption: 'Significantly activated ERBB2 (HER2) signaling pathway in invasive fibroblasts.
  (A and B) Dot plot visualization of the −Log10(FDR) (A) and bar plot visualization
  of the activation Z-score (B) of the top 30 activated and inhibited upstream regulators
  of invasive fibroblasts by IPA analysis. ERBB2 was the most activated regulators
  of invasive fibroblasts. ERBB2 was highlighted as the most activated regulator.
  (C) IPA analysis revealed the upstream regulators of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma
  cancer cells compared to primary cancer cells retrieved from GSE131907. Most of
  the top activated/inhibited (listed in red/green texts, respectively) upstream regulators
  of invasive fibroblasts were these of metastatic cancer cells. (D) Pearson correlation
  analysis of activation z-score of shared upstream regulators (n = 129) of invasive
  fibroblasts versus metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell. Linear regression
  analysis was performed and visualized in red line. (E) p-HER2, total HER2, and SEMA7A
  protein levels in sorted SEMA7A high and negative fibroblasts in nine IPF fibroblast
  lines were determined by Western blot. GAPDH served as loading control. (F) Quantification
  of the Western blot was used to determine the relative protein levels of p-HER2,
  total HER2, and SEMA7A in E (n = 9 per group). (G and H) p-HER2 and total HER2 in
  sorted fibroblasts from three normal and four IPF lung were determined by Western
  blot and quantification was performed (H; n = 4). Neg, megative; P, proximal lung
  regions; D, distal lung regions. Two independent experiments were performed on fibroblasts
  from different patients (F and H). Data are the mean ± SEM. *, P < 0.05; **, P <
  0.01; ****, P < 0.0001 by Student’s t test (F and H). Source data are available
