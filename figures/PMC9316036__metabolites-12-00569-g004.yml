caption: Optimization results of minimizing the energy demands of bacterial NAD biosynthetic
  pathways. (A) A scatter plot showing the optimized abundance of Nampt versus PncA
  when minimizing the ratio of ATP consumption to NAD production required to maintain
  the required NAD steady-state concentration (). Each dot represents an optimisation
  result. The marginal plots show kernel density estimate plots that show the enzyme
  abundance distributions in the optimisation results. (B) Abundance of metabolic
  enzymes at different temperatures in the PncA pathway. (C) Optimized abundance of
  metabolic enzymes in Nampt pathway. (D) The ATP consumption flux, , in the PncA
  pathway (dashed red curve) compared with the Nampt pathway (blue curve) at different
  temperatures. (E) The NAD production flux, , in the PncA pathway compared with that
  in the Nampt pathway at different temperatures. (F) The ratio of ATP consumption
  to NAD production at different temperatures in PncA and Nampt pathways.
