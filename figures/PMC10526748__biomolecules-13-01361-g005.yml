caption: Functional analysis of genes co-expressed with TAARs in primary and metastatic
  breast tumors. (a) Venn diagram illustrating an overlay of genes co-expressed (r
  > 0.3, p > 0.05) with TAARs in primary (GSE119937, blue circle) and metastatic breast
  tumors (GSE113890, GSE184717, magenta and cyan circles, respectively); (b) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of genes, co-expressed with TAARs in all three datasets;
  (c) Venn diagram illustrating an overlay of genes co-expressed with TAARs in all
  three datasets and involved in the “Neuroactive ligand–receptor interactions” KEGG
  pathway and (d) mapping these genes on the “Neuroactive ligand–receptor interactions”
  KEGG pathway scheme.
