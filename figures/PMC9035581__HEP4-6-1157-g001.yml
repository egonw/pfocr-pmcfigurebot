caption: 'FOXS1 predicts a poor prognosis in human cancer. (A) In situ hybridization
  on human HCC samples using FOXS1 sense (S) and antisense (AS) riboprobes. Black
  arrows: FOXS1 expression in fibroblast‐like cells in the interface fibrotic tissue
  (FT). (B) Clinical relevance of FOXS1 silencing signature in HCC. Dendrogram overview
  of in vitro experiments using SNU‐449 cells transfected with siNC or siFOXS1 integrated
  with 139 cases of human HCC based on the expression of 177 genes differentially
  expressed after FOXS1 silencing. Two major clusters were identified: cluster 1 associated
  with FOXS1 silencing and cluster 2 associated with high FOXS1 expression. Distribution
  of HCC between previously described subgroups with respect to survival (23) (good
  vs. poor prognosis), cell origin (24) (hepatoblast vs. hepatocyte), activation of
  MET/HGF (22) (negative vs. positive), and TGF‐β signaling pathway (5) (early vs.
  late) is indicated on the left side. (C) Statistical analysis of HCC distribution
  between clusters 1 and 2 based on previous gene signatures and clinical parameters.
  (D) Kaplan‐Meier plots and log‐rank statistical analysis revealed a significant
  decreased overall survival for patients included in cluster 2. (E) Expression of
  FOXS1 in 17 cancer types from the TCGA consortium. (F) Kaplan‐Meier plots and log‐rank
  statistics analysis revealed a significant decreased overall survival for patients
  with a high expression of FOXS1 in liver, kidney, colon, and stomach cancer. Abbreviations:
  NT, nontumor; T, tumor.'
