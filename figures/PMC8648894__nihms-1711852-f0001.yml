caption: A simplified diagram of cell proliferation signaling in the crowded cell.
  In the presence of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal, Ras gets activated
  (upper left region). Ras activates Raf through the kinase domain dimerization. Active
  Raf dimer activates MEK, and subsequently activates ERK through cascading phosphorylation,
  leading to cell proliferation. Oncogenic Ras forms nanoclusters, promoting Raf dimerization
  (upper right region). In the MAPK pathway, KSR scaffolds MEK and ERK, substituting
  Raf and forming heterodimer with Raf. In the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, both RTK and
  Ras recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane and fully activate it (lower right region).
  PI3K phosphorylates signaling lipid, PIP2 to PIP3, leading to cell growth. PTEN
  dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2, suppressing the growth signal. In the missing RTK
  signal, both CaM and KRas4B can fully activate PI3KÎ± in the KRAS-driven adenocarcinoma
  (lower left region). PDK1 and mTORC2 phosphorylate and activate AKT, and active
  AKT phosphorylates multiple sites in TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex) containing
  TSC1, TSC2, and TBC (Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16). Phosphorylated TSC impairs the GAP activity
  for RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain), increasing the population of active GTP-bound
  RHEB. At the lysosomal surface in the presence of cytosolic amino acids, RHEB-GTP
  activates mTORC1 in complex with the LYNUS (lysosome nutrient sensing) machinery.
  The LYNUS complex involves a heterodimer of Rag isoforms, Ragulator, SLC38A9 (sodium-coupled
  neutral amino acid transporter 9, an arginine-regulated transporter), and V-ATPase
  (vacuolar ATPase, a proton pump). IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein in both MAPK and
  PI3K/AKT pathways (right region). The multi-domain protein of IQGAP1 is composed
  of the N-terminal CHD (calponin-homology domain), IQ repeats, WW (polyproline binding
  region) domain, IQ domain with four IQ motifs, GRD (Ras GTPase activating protein-related
  domain), and RGCT (RasGAP C-terminus). Here we propose that the entities are not
  physically separated as shown here, but dynamically physically linked, transiently
  clustered within phases, in line with high resolution imaging, such as that of the
  ER and actin [], and actin, spectrin, and other molecules forming a MPS (membrane-associated
  periodic skeleton) in neurons to which e.g. GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors),
  cell adhesion molecules, RTKs, are recruited to promote ERK signaling [].
