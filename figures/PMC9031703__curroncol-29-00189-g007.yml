caption: Crosstalks between Wnt/ β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The activation
  of both signaling pathways results in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK-3β) activity via various upstream events. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a fraction
  of AXIN-bound GSK3β has a vital role in controlling β-catenin degradation through
  the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation. At the same time, activated PI3K phosphorylate
  Akt at Ser9 residue, which further inhibits the GSK3β activity. As a result, transcription
  of oncogenes was initiated. This illustration was created using resources available
  at www.biorender.com (accessed on 25 September 2021).
