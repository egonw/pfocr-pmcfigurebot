caption: 'How probiotic can be involved in maintaining skeletal muscle health: regulatory
  signals and metabolites. Probiotics can promote the production of metabolites such
  as short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), secondary bile acids (BAs), and some amino acids
  that can ultimately modulate muscle function. SCFAs, via their interaction with
  G protein‐coupled receptor (GPR) 41/13 receptors in the ileum and colon, promote
  the secretion of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and peptide YY (PYY) by intestinal
  L cells, which in turn stimulate insulin secretion by the pancreas and improve insulin
  sensitivity in peripheral organs. At the muscle level, actetate uptake and oxidation
  as well as its and interaction with GPR receptors leads to phophorylation of AMPK
  as well as activation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor δ and α. In
  parallel, insulin, IGF‐1, and amino acids stimulate the phosphoinositide 3‐kinase
  (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway, which increases glucose uptake [via
  glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)], promotes protein synthesis (via activation
  of S6K), and reduces muscle proteolysis via inhibition of forkhead box O (FOXO)
  and Unc‐51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1) factors. SCFAs can also inhibit
  HDACs that participated in regulation of expression of various genes in the nucleus,
  including the expression of nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) pathway‐related genes. Secondary
  BAs also promote GLP‐1 secretion via activation of G protein‐coupled bile acid receptor,
  Gpbar1 (TGR5), and play a role in muscle trophicity by mechanisms that still require
  to be further investigated. 4E‐BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E‐binding
