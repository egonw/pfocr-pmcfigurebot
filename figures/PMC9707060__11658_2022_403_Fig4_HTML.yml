caption: UCK2 promoted cell cycle progression via regulating the expression of mTOR.
  A Volcano plot exhibited the gene expression altered after UCK2 knockdown. B The
  genes upregulated after UCK2 knockdown were enriched in the signalling pathway in
  the left panel; the genes downregulated are shown in the right panel. C Heatmap
  showed the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis in the indicated
  cell lines. D Western blot (WB) examined the protein expression of p-mTOR and mTOR
  in the indicated cell lines. E The indicated cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated
  with anti-UCK2 antibody; the protein expression of mTOR was examined by WB. F IHC
  detected the protein expression of UCK2 and mTOR in the left panel, and Pearson’s
  correlation analysis was used to determine the linear relationship between UCK2
  and mTOR in the right panel. G CCK8 assays was used to determine the proliferation
  of the indicated cell lines; cells were treated with 10 μM rapamycin to block the
  mTOR signalling pathway. H Representative images for cell cycle assays in indicated
  cell lines in the left panel, and statistical analysis in the right panel. *p < 0.05;
