figure_title: Transcriptomic analysis of RHO-CNV retinal organoids presented elevated
  RHO expression
caption: (A) qRT-PCR analysis shows ~3 Log2FC increased RHO mRNA levels in patient
  (RM) organoids at both the time-points of rod differentiation and maturation. No
  significant change was observed in other photoreceptor genes except for a small
  ~1 Log2FC increase in rod arrestin (SAG) at D300 time-point. Log2FC=Log 2 Foldchange.
  Statistical two-way ANOVA analysis with Fisher’s LSD test and 95% confidence interval.
  * = p <0.05, and **** = p <0.0001. Blue bars, D120; Maroon bars, D300 (B) Volcano
  plot showing significant differentially expressed genes. Significantly upregulated
  genes are highlighted in red and significantly downregulated genes are highlighted
  in blue (adjusted p<0.01). (C) Dot plot showing EnrichGO analysis of biological
  process on the differentially expressed genes. The size of the dot represents number
  of differentially expressed genes in the pathway and the X-axis represent the ratio
  over all genes associated with the pathway. Plot shows a defect in rods and phototransduction
  associated pathways as well as synaptic transmission suggesting rod dysfunction.
  (D) Box plot showing the data from pathway enrichment analysis of cellular component
  category predominantly highlighting the defect in glycosylation and Golgi/ER modification/transport.
  Colors in the dot and blot plots represent relative significance (calculated p-values
  in scale). N=3–4 independent experiments and 12–15 organoids per experiment.
