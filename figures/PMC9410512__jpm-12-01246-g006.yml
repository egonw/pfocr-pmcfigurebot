caption: Remodeling of the Adra1b networking with genes from the KEGG-designed functional
  pathway “Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes” caused by the post ischemic heart
  failure with and without stem cell treatment. (a) Significantly synergistically
  and antagonistically expressed partners of Adra1b in “NN” hearts. (b) Significantly
  synergistically and antagonistically expressed partners of Adra1b in “IN” hearts.
  (c) Significantly synergistically and antagonistically expressed partners of Adra1b
  in “IT” hearts. (d) Independently expressed genes with Adra1b.
