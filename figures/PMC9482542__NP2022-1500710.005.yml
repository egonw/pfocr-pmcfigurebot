caption: 'Expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-2/Bax in the hippocampus
  of various groups of mice. (a) Western blot analysis, Bcl-2, and Bax images. (b–d)
  Bcl-2, Bax protein expression, and Bcl-2/Bax levels in each group of mice. β-Actin
  was used as an internal reference protein, and the data are mean ± SD (n = 8/group).
