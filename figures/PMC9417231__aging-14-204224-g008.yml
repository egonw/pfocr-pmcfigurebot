caption: GSEA for SAAL1-enriched KEGG pathways and GO terms in tumors (THCA, LIHC,
  CHOL, STAD, THYM, TGCT, DLBC and LUSC) with high and low SAAL1 expression. The upward
  trend of the enrichment score (ES) lines denote pathway enrichment in the high SAAL1
  expression group, and the downward trend of the ES lines indicate pathway enrichment
  in the low SAAL1 expression group. The top five items with the highest correlation
  with SAAL1 expression were analyzed by KEGG and GO enrichment analysis.
article_title: SAAL1, a novel oncogene, is associated with prognosis and immunotherapy
  in multiple types of cancer.
