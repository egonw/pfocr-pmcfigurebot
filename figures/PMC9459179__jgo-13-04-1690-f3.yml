caption: PPI and functional analyses. (A) The PPI network. The circular nodes represent
  the upregulated genes, and the square nodes represent the downregulated genes. The
  blue nodes show the genes in cluster 1, the green nodes show the genes in cluster
  2, and the pink nodes show the genes in cluster 3. The size of each node represents
  the degree value. (B) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the hub genes in the
  PPI network. The hub genes were those with a degree â‰¥5. PPI, protein-protein interaction,
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
