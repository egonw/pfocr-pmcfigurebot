caption: 'Cortex-specific IPA analysis of DEGs by limma post cerebral hypoperfusion.
  (A) Volcano plots indicated genes with differential expression as defined by an
  adjusted P value < 0.05 and    > 1 in the cerebral cortex after operation (BCAS
  vs. Sham). Points highlighted in red: significant differentially expressed gene:
  Points highlighted in blue: significant differentially down-regulated expressed
  gene; Gray dot: non-significant differentially expressed gene. (B) Bar plot showing
  the top canonical pathways significantly enriched in the BCAS-hypoperfusion mice.
  Orange bars; positive regulatory pathway; Gray bar: no activity pattern available.
  (Câ€“E) Upstream regulatory analysis of DEGs revealing IRF7-related hub genes are
  pointed to be the top upstream regulators in IPA effect networks. TLRs also participated
  in and coordinately regulated genes of IFN signaling. (F) IGV map tracks for representative
  genes in the too canonical pathways. Notice increases of RNA-seq signal for IFN-regulated
  genes (Irf7, Irf8, Tlr4, and Tlr7) in BCAS mice compared to sham group.'
