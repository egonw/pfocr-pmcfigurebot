caption: 'Panel (A) displays the univariate logistic model for the variables that
  showed a statistically significant effect on pCR. Panel (B) shows the stacked bar
  plots of the biomarker expression level in terms of categorized international immunoreactive
  score (SxP_irs_c), comparatively for tumors that reached pCR and those which did
  not (No pCR). Panel (C) shows the multivariate logistic model which includes all
  the variables showing a significant impact on pCR in the univariate model. Abbreviations:
  ER_70 = estrogen receptor with cut-off at 70% (ER > 70% vs. Others); BMI_20 = body
  mass index with cut-off of 20 (BMI > 20 vs. Others). Suffixes: _C = cytoplasmic.
  In Panel (C), * represents p < 0.05, as the only statistical significance level.'
