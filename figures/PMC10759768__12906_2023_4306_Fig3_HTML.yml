caption: Shikonin is related to TSG expression alterations through MAPK signaling.
  (A) A total of 1795 upregulated genes and by 1645 downregulated genes by Shikonin
  in A549 cells through mRNA sequencing analysis. (B) Heatmap of the top 100 changed
  genes by shikonin. (C) The upregulated genes are mainly involved in MAPK signaling
  pathway by KEGG profiling
article_title: Shikonin reactivates TSGs GADD45B and PPP3CC to block NSCLC cell proliferation
  and migration through JNK/P38/MAPK signaling pathways.
