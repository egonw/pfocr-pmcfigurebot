caption: In EC, m6A regulatory proteins contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis
  by interacting with various RNAs. METTL14 mutation or reduced expression of METTL3
  increases the proliferation and tumorigenicity of EC by activating the AKT pathway.
  WTAP downregulates CAV‐1 expression to activate the NF‐κB signaling pathway in EC,
  promoting EC progression. HIF-1α and HIF-2α activate the expression of ALKBH5 under
  hypoxic conditions, facilitating the SOX2 expression by demethylating the SOX2 mRNA,
  leading to the tumorigenesis of EC. ALKBH5 demethylates the target transcript IGF1R
  and enhances its mRNA stability to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of EC. FTO
  promotes HOXB13 protein expression, activates the WNT signaling pathway, and promotes
  EC invasion and metastasis. PADI2 activates the IGF2BP1 expression and helps in
  maintaining the mRNA stability and expression of SOX2, thereby supporting the malignancy
  state of EC. IGF2BP1 recruits PABPC1 to promote PEG10 protein expression, contributing
  to the tumorigenesis of EC. YTHDF2 inhibits the expression of IRS1 and inhibits
  IRS1/AKT signaling pathway, consequently inhibiting the tumorigenicity of EC. YTHDF2-mediated
  LncRNA FENDRR degradation promotes cellular proliferation by elevating the SOX4
  expression in EC
