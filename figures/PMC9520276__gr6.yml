caption: Macrophage XBP1/STING/NLRP3 signalling pathway mediates hepatic stellate
  cells activation.(A) Schematic drawing showing that primary mouse HSCs or LX-2 cells
  were treated with CM of LPS-treated Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs and CM of LPS +
  DMXAA-treated Xbp1M-KO BMDMs in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 for 24 h. (B)
  Immunofluorescence staining for α-SMA (green) in treated primary mouse HSCs. The
  expression levels of Acta2 (C), Col1a1 (D), and Timp1 (E) in treated primary mouse
  HSCs were examined using quantitative real-time PCR; n = 3/group. (F) Immunofluorescence
  staining for α-SMA (green) in treated LX-2 cells. The expression levels of ACTA2
  (G), COL1A1 (H), and TIMP1 (I) in treated LX-2 cells were examined using quantitative
  real-time PCR; n = 3/group. (J) The protein levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and TIMP1
  in treated LX-2 cells were examined using Western blot. The values are shown as
  mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA. ∗p <0.05. Acta2/α-SMA,
