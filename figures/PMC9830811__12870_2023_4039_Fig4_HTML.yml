caption: 'Effects of P and Zn supply on transcriptome profiling of lateral roots emerging
  from the primary roots of maize. Inbred line B73 were grown in a hydroponic solution
  containing different combinations of P and Zn for 7 days. A Diagram of sampling
  position. The red-dotted box indicates the sampling location on the primary root
  for RNA-seq. Scale bars = 1 cm. B Expression pattern clustering of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in response to +P-Zn and -P-Zn compared with +P+Zn. Cluster
  1: specifically induced by +P-Zn; Cluster 2: specifically repressed by +P-Zn; Cluster
  3: specifically induced by -P-Zn; Cluster 4: specifically repressed by -P-Zn (cluster
  4, 1344 genes); Cluster 5: different response to +P-Zn and -P-Zn than to +P + Zn.
  The gradient color scale indicates gene expression levels, which were normalized
  by the Z-score of gene expression across the three samples. C Gene ontology (GO)
  enrichment of DEGs in cluster 1. The scatter plot displays the 20 highest enriched
  terms. The enrichment factor is the ratio of DEG numbers in the GO entry term to
  all gene numbers in this pathway term. The point size represents the number of genes
  in the pathway; the point color meant –log10(P-value). D List of genes involved
  in the auxin signaling pathway in cluster 1. The gradient color scale indicates
  gene expression levels, which were normalized by the Z-score of gene expression
  across three samples'
