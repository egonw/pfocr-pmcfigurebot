caption: The STEM analysis of mutant ΔQrr5 during the infection period compared to
  wild-type strain by RNA-Seq. (a) Gene trend expression enrichment map of the wild-type
  group. (b) Gene trend expression enrichment map of ΔQrr5 group. The colors represent
  the module where the major genes are located, and the white represents the module
  where fewer genes are located. (c) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results of all
  genes in profile 14 (the profile where Qrr5 is located) of the wild-type group trend.
  (d) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results of all genes in profile 10 (the profile
  where most T3SS1 genes are located) of the ΔQrr5 group trend.
