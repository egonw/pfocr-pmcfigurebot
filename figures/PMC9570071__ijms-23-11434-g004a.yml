caption: 'Involvement of zebrafish Wnt signaling pathway in Cd2+-induced neurodevelopmental
  disorders. (A,B) Fluorescence imaging of 6 dpf Tg(elavl3:EGFP) larvae and statistics
  of relative fluorescence intensity. (C,D) Confocal fluorescence imaging of the telencephalon
  and midbrain regions, as well as the statistics of telencephalon proportion. (E,F)
  Imaging of the PVL region in 6 dpf Tg(elavl3: EGFP) larvae and density statistics
  of PVN. (G–I) Imaging of trigeminal ganglion neurons and structural analysis in
  24 hpf zebrafish embryos. (J) Relative expression of genes related to neurodevelopment
  and differentiation. In histograms, values are represented as mean ± SEM, while
  in boxplots, values are represented as median and mean, and whiskers show 90% confidence
  levels. The results of nonparametric test and ANOVA, as well as multiple comparison
  test are listed in . “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001).'
