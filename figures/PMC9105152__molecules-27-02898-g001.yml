caption: Cytotoxicity of artificial particulate matter (APM) and diesel exhaust particles
  (DEP) in alveolar macrophages (MH-S). Negative controls (NC) are untreated samples.
  MH-S was treated with APM and DEP of different concentrations for 6 h. (A) Cell
  viability was measured using the 3–(4,5–dimethylthiazol–2–yl)–2,5–diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide (MTT) assay in the APM– and DEP–stimulated MH-S cells. (B) Morphological
  changes in MH-S by exposure to APM/DEP. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n =
  6 per group). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, or *** p < 0.001 vs. NC.
