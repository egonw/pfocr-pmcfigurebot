caption: 'Network analyses by microarray analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis.
  A: The signaling map of “Cell Cycle: G1/S Checkpoint Regulation,” one of the top-ranked
  canonical pathways related to the depletion of anoctamin 5 (ANO5) according to ingenuity
  pathway analysis. Red and green colors indicate genes with expression levels that
  were higher or lower, respectively, than reference RNA levels; B: To verify gene
  expression profiling data, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CCNE2, and E2F1 were examined
  by real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The downregulation
  of ANO5 effectively reduced CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CCNE2, and E2F1 mRNA levels and increased
  CDKN1A/p21 mRNA levels in NUGC4 and MKN45 cells; C: The downregulation of ANO5 effectively
  reduced the phosphorylation levels of Rb protein in NUGC4 and MKN45 cells; D: The
  downregulation of ANO5 increased the phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  protein in NUGC4 and MKN45 cells. n = 3, mean ± standard error of the mean. aP <
  0.05 (significantly different from control small interfering RNA). ANO5: Anoctamin
  5; siRNA: Small interfering RNA; Cont.: Control; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ACTB:
  β-actin.'
