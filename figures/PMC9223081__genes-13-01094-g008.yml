caption: The possible biological processes related to the risk score revealed by the
  functional enrichment analysis. (A) The significantly enriched KEGG pathways of
  the differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups in the
  entire set. (B) The significantly enriched KEGG pathways between the high- and low-risk
  groups in the entire set based on the RNA-seq data through the GSEA analysis. (C)
  The “Ferroptosis” pathway and some metabolic pathways related to it are enriched
  in the low-risk group of the entire set based on the RNA-seq data via the GSEA analysis.
  (D) The violin plot shows the difference in EMT scores between the high- and low-risk
  groups in the entire set.
