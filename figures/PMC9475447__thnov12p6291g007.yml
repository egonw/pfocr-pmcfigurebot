caption: Functional analysis of the METTL14/lncDBET/FABP5 pathway in the regulation
  of PPARγ. (A-B) qPCR analysis of METTL14, DBET, FABP5 and PPARs in EJ-M3 and J82
  cell lines transfected with pcDH-NC+shNC, pcDH-NC+shMETTL14, shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET
  and shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET+shFABP5. (C-D) Western blotting analysis of METTL14,
  FABP5 and PPARs in EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with pcDH-NC+shNC, pcDH-NC+shMETTL14,
  shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET and shMETTL14+pcDH-lncDBET+shFABP5. (E) CCK8 assay for the
  viability of EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shPPARγ or control shRNA
  (shNC). (F) Transwell, EdU and flow cytometry assays for the migration, proliferation
  and apoptosis of EJ-M3 and J82 cell lines transfected with shPPARγ or control shRNA
  (shNC). Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The symbol * denotes
  a significant difference (P < 0.05), while ** represents a highly significant difference
  (P < 0.01).
