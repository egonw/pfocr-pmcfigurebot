caption: Effect of taurine on the binding of Ets-1 to the TXNIP promoter. Caco-2 cells
  were cultured in medium containing 100 mM of taurine. After 48 h, a ChIP assay was
  performed as described in Materials and Methods. The results are expressed as relative
  values with 100% being the DNA value before immunoprecipitation. Each value represents
  the mean Â± S.E. (n = 2).
