caption: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated the NF‐κB VEGF‐C signaling pathway through
  TRAF6. (A) Western blot analysis of TRAF6 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated
  with LPS. GAPDH served as a loading control. The relative protein expression levels
  of TRAF6 were quantified. (B) Lymphatic tube formation assay analysis for lymphangiogenesis
  in LPS‐treated SW480 and HCT116 cells. One representative image from three reproducible
  experiments is shown. The number of lymphatic tubes is shown in the bar graph. (C)
  Dual‐luciferase reporter assay analysis of pNF‐κB‐Luc and VEGF‐C promoter in LPS‐treated
  SW480 and HCT116 cells. The Renilla luciferase express vector pRL‐TK was used for
  standardization. After transfection for 48 h, the relative activities were measured.
  (D, E) Western blot analysis of TRAF6, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C expression with different
  concentrations of LPS in SW480 and HCT116 cells. GAPDH served as a loading control.
  The relative protein expression levels of TRAF6, pNF‐κB, and VEGF‐C in SW480 and
  HCT116 cells were quantified. (F) Quantitative PCR analysis of TRAF6 and VEGF‐C
  mRNA levels with different times of LPS treatment in SW480 and HCT116 cells. (G)
  Western blot analysis of TRAF6 and VEGF‐C expression with different times of LPS
  treatment in SW480 and HCT116 cells. GAPDH served as a loading control. Data are
  shown as mean ±SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001
