caption: Overexpression of miR-26a-5p exerts the antitumor effects in vivo. (a)–(d)
  The body weight, tumor weight, and volume were detected after miR-26a-5p upregulation,
  miR-26a-5p, and DNMT3A coupregulation. (e) The pathological change was determined
  by H&E staining after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p, and DNMT3A coupregulation.
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (f) The expression of DNMT3A, SFRP1, and Ki67 was analyzed by
  IHC after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p, and DNMT3A coupregulation. Scale bar
  = 20 μm. (g)–(i) Protein levels of CCND1, MYC, β-catenin, NANOG, and SOX2 were examined
  by western blotting after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p, and DNMT3A coupregulation.
  (j) CD34, CD133, and ALDH1 positive cells were identified by FCM after miR-26a-5p
  upregulation, miR-26a-5p, and DNMT3A coupregulation. Control group was used as the
  blank control. ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
