caption: Genes modulating canonical Wnt signaling associated with selection and DE
  CREs. CREs were associated with genes if they occur within 500â€…kb of TSSs. Genes
  associated with selection CREs have square outlines. Genes associated with CREs
  that are DE between orthologs have red (higher in human) or blue (higher in chimpanzee)
  fill. Genes associated with CREs that are DE between cell types are marked with
  horizontal (higher in NPC) or vertical (higher in neuron) stripes, and stripe colors
  indicate if the human (stripes) or chimpanzee (stripes) CRE was DE. The selection
  and DE profiles of CREs associated with paralogous genes are combined for each gene
  in the pathway but are separately defined in . Genes with circular outlines and
  white color are not associated with CREs in our assay but are included to inform
  about relevant interactions.
