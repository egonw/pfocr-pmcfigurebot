caption: The gradual improvement of tumor immunotherapy strategies. In Step 1, the
  main goal is to enhance the lethality of the immune system against the tumor to
  reduce the harm of tumors spread to the human body. In Step 2, the researchers found
  that cancer could escape from the monitoring of the immune system through a series
  of immune pathways, from merely increasing the T cell effect to suppressing the
  tumor immune escape pathway. In Step 3, to further enhance the response rate and
  overall survival of the tumor patients, a new method of immunotherapy based on combination
  therapy and individualized therapy was adopted. MHC expression deficiency plays
  an essential role in tumor immunotherapy, one of the main directions for future
  treatment.
