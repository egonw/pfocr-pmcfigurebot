caption: Knockout of TLRs reprograms COPD-associated protumorigenic inflammatory phenotype
  into an antitumorigenic phenotype. Total inflammatory cell and lineage-specific
  leukocyte numbers from BALF (n=6-8) (A). Relative mRNA expression of CXCL1, CCL2,
  IFNG, TNF, GZMB, IL1B, IL17, and RETNLB mRNA in whole lungs, normalized by CD45
  expression (n=4-6) (B-I). Data represent mean ± SEM; experimental groups are separately
  compared to CC-LR cohort, where "*", "#", "+" denote p< 0.05 by unpaired t-test
  of Total WBC, Macrophages, and Neutrophils respectively.
article_title: Toll-like receptors 2, 4, and 9 modulate promoting effect of COPD-like
  airway inflammation on K-ras-driven lung cancer through activation of the MyD88/NF-ĸB
  pathway in the airway epithelium.
