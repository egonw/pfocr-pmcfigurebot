caption: 'Silencing AQP4 inhibits PPAR‐α pathway and reduces LPS‐induced apoptosis
  of M064 cells. (A) Search of AQP4‐related genes. Each circle in the figure represents
  a gene, and the lines between circles indicate that there is correlation between
  genes. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of AQP4‐related genes. X‐axis represents
  GeneRatio, y‐axis represents functional items, circle size represents the number
  of enriched genes in the items, colour represents enrichment p value, and the right
  histogram is colour scale. (C) qRT‐PCR was used to detect the expression of PPAR‐α
  in colonic mucosa of healthy controls (n = 17) and patients with IBD (n = 35). (D)
  The localization and expression of PPAR‐α in mouse colonic mucosa tissues were determined
  with immunohistochemistry (n = 10, scale bar: 50 μm). (E) Western blot assay was
  used to detect the protein expression pattern of PPAR‐α in M064 cells after LPS
  stimulation. (F) The interaction between AQP4 and PPAR‐α in M064 cells was determined
  by Co‐IP, and its expression was subjected to Western blot assay. (G) Western blot
  analysis was used to detect the protein expression patterns of AQP4 and PPAR‐α in
  M064 cells after silencing AQP4. (H) The protein expression patterns of AQP4 and
  PPAR‐α in M064 cells with different treatment were detected by Western blot analysis.
  (I) CCK‐8 assay was performed to detect cell proliferation. (J) Flow cytometry was
  performed to detect cell apoptosis. Data between two groups were compared by unpaired
  t test and those among multiple groups by one‐way ANOVA, followed by Tukey''s post
  hoc tests. **p < 0.01. ***p < 0.001. ****p < 0.0001. Cell experiments were conducted
  three times independently'
