caption: Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showing the differential gene expressions
  (DGEs) between rNJ0612NME6 (WT) or rNJ0612NME6-M51R (mutant) of genes associated
  with interferon (IFN) responses. These analysis included genes associated with;
  (A) Interferons (IFNs), (B) IFN signaling pathway, (C) Viral RNA sensing and enhancement
  of the IFN response, (D) Inhibition of IFN expression, (E) Transcription factors,
  (F) NFκΒ inhibition (G) IFN signaling suppression, and (H) Suppression of RIG-I-like
  sensors. HCA employs a color scheme to represent the extent of gene expression,
  with gradients ranging from green (suppressed or decreased) to red (increased).
  More information about the DGEs of these genes can be found in .
