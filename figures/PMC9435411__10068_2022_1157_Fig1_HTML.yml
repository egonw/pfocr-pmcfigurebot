caption: Schematic illustration of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria, including
  A alteration of membrane permeability (mutated lipoteichoic acid [LTA], mutated
  porin channel, and lipocalin), B modification of antibiotic target sites (mutated
  penicillin-binding proteins [PBPs] and modified peptidoglycan), C enzymatic degradation
  of antibiotics (Î²-lactamases and transferase), D activation of bacterial efflux
  pump systems (major facilitator superfamily [MFS], small multidrug resistance [SMR],
  multidrug and toxic compound extrusion [MATE], ATP binding cassette [ABC], and resistance
  nodulation division [RND]), and E bypass of metabolic pathway inhibited by antibiotics
  (alternative folic acid synthesis)
