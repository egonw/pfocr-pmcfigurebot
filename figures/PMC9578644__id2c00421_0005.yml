caption: 'Fraction of α2,6-sialylated complement cascade enriched in COVID-19 blood
  and lungs. (a) Scheme of the later portion of the complement cascade pathway and
  downstream signaling. Maroon boxes indicate complement proteins that were positive
  hits in our glycoproteomic analysis in . (b) Differential α2,6-sialylation of complements
  C5 and C9 in three patient groups. Western blot (anti-C5 and anti-C9) of SNA pulldown
  samples from pooled patient plasma with corresponding input is shown. Intensity
  ratios of pulldown/input bands are depicted in the bar plot. (c) Analysis of individual
  per patient paired ratio of ST6GAL1 to C5 mRNA expression in whole blood of healthy
  controls (n = 19), those with seasonal coronavirus (n = 59), or those with COVID-19
  (n = 46), from publicly available data set Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE161731. Student’s
  t test was used to determine p-values: ns, not statistical; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. (d) Representative images of IHC staining against
  C5b, C9, ST6GAL1, or Pan-Cytokeratin in the lower lobe of the lungs in COVID-19-negative
  (n = 2) (top) or COVID-19-positive (n = 8) (bottom) autopsy specimens. Scale bars
  represent 75 μm.'
