caption: Construction of stable CYP27C1-knockdown or stable CYP27C1-overexpressed
  human lung cancer cell lines. (A) Protein level of stable CYP27C1-knockdown A549,
  H1975 cells, stable CYP27C1-overexpressd H460 cells, and the corresponding non-transfected
  control and vector control cells was detected by immunoblot analysis. (B) Grey scales
  of the bands were analyzed by Gel-Pro ANALYZER. Results were analyzed by unpaired
  two-tailed T test. Lines with blunt arrow indicated the comparison between different
  groups. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ****, p < 0.0001 n.s., p > 0.05.
