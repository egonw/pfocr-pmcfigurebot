caption: 'Effects of MC extract on stimulating caspase-dependent death signaling pathway.
  (a) HeLa cells were treated with MC extract at different concentrations (UT: untreated;
  62.5, 125, and 250 μg/mL) for 24 h, subjected to Annexin V/PI staining and flow
  cytometry. (b) Quantitative analysis of apoptotic HeLa cells from Annexin V/PI staining
  and flow cytometry. (c) Full-length and cleaved caspase 9, caspase 7, and PARP were
  detected by western blot analysis. Actin was used as an internal control. Data are
  representatives of three individual replicates.'
