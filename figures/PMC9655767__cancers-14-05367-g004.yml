caption: SETD8 regulates the expression of p53-related genes associated with endometrial
  cancer prognosis. (A) Volcano plots illustrating DEGs (FDR < 0.05, |logFC| > 1,
  red dots) between HEC1B cells treated with negative control (n = 3) and SETD8-targeting
  siRNA (n = 4). Differences in Log2 fold change in gene expression values are plotted
  on the x-axis. Adjusted p-values calculated using the Benjamin–Hochberg method are
  plotted on the y-axis. Genes corresponding to the KEGG p53 pathway are shown as
  large circles. (B) The same volcano plots as in (A) depicting the results from the
  HEC50B cell line. (C) Refinement of p53 gene regulated by SETD8. KEGG pathway analysis
  identified 11 genes associated with p53 that were significantly elevated in both
  HEC1B and HEC50B cell lines following SETD8 knockdown. Among the 11 genes, we identified
  four genes whose expression was positively correlated with the prognosis of endometrial
  cancer clinical specimens (TCGA). Overlapping p-value = 1.6 × 10−35. Overlap was
  tested using Fisher’s exact test. (D) Expression of CDKN1A, SFN, and GADD45G in
  the TCGA database and their influence of endometrial cancer prognosis.
