caption: Immunofluorescence labelling of SIRT1, p53, p21 and FoxO proteins in 4TLM
  and 67NR cell lines. (a) Representative images showing the expression of SIRT1,
  p53 and p21 in 67NR and 4TLM cancer cells. Red signals represents target protein
  expression, and blue signals represent DAPI, which was used to stain the nucleus.
  (b) Representative images show in FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO4 expression in 67NR and
  4TLM cancer cells. Green signals represent target protein expression, and blue signals
  represent DAPI, which was used to stain the nucleus. Scale bar represents 50 Î¼m.
