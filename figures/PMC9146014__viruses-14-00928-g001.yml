caption: Pyrimidine synthesis pathway in humans. The de novo synthesis pathway of
  pyrimidine is represented by blue arrows, and the salvage pathway is represented
  by green arrows. The de novo synthesis pathway begins with dihydroorotate from glutamine
  and aspartate under the action of CAD multifunctional enzymes (steps 1–3). The mitochondrial
  inner membrane protein DHODH oxidizes DHO to produce orotate (step 4). Orotate is
  subsequently phosphorylated and produces UMP from the bifunctional enzyme UMPS (steps
  5–6). In the salvage pathway, exogenous uridine and cytidine can be transformed
  into UMP and CTP, respectively. UDP is the raw material for DNA synthesis. CTP and
  UTP are the raw materials for RNA synthesis. CAD, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase,
  aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase; UMP, uridine monophosphate; DHODH,
  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; UDP, uridine diphosphate; UTP, uridine triphosphate;
  CMP, cytidine monophosphate; CDP, cytidine diphosphate; CTP, cytidine triphosphate;
  CTPS, CTP synthase; dUDP, deoxy-UDP; dTTP, deoxythymidine triphosphate; UMPS, uridine
  monophosphate synthetase; CMPK, cytidine monophosphate kinase; NDPK, nucleoside-diphosphate
  kinase; CDA, cytidine deaminase; UCK, uridine or cytidine kinase; RR, ribonucleotide
  reductase.
