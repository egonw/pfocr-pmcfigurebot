caption: (A) The chemical structure of BI-3802 as a special MG compound; (B) the diagram
  model for BI-3802-induced BCL6 polymerization, ubiquitination, and degradation.
  BI-3802 through the BTB domain of BCL6 makes BCL6 dimerization and then induces
  the dimerized BCL6 formation of helical filament. The polymerized BCL6 enhances
  the E3 ligase SIAHI interaction and ubiquitination of the polymerized BCL6 protein
  for degradation through the ubiquitination proteasome pathway.
