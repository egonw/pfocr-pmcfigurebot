caption: The OVs can specifically lyse tumor cells, sparing normal cells. Following
  viral infection, most normal cells activate the antiviral pathway, thereby controlling
  the infection. The antiviral mechanism can be triggered by activating the Toll-like
  receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling by viral PAMPs, which might include viral
  nucleic acids. Once the virus is detected, a signaling cascade of several IFN components
  JAK, STAT and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) leads to a programmed transcription
  pathway that limits the spread of the virus and can target infected cells for apoptosis
  or necrosis. Local IFN production induced by the innate immune response to viral
  infection may also contribute to antiviral activity via IFNR. Type I IFN signals
  through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway lead to the upregulation of cell cycle regulators,
  such as PKR and IRF7. These regulators limit viral spread by binding to viral particles
  and triggering the type I IFN transcriptional pathway, promoting aborted apoptosis
  and cytokine production in infected cells.
