caption: Effect of D-carvone on serum and liver biomarkers in CCl4-intoxicated rats.
  (A) serum ALT, (B) serum AST, (C) liver MDA, (D) liver SOD, (E) liver GSH, and (F)
  liver TAC. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 7). Data were analyzed by one
  way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, ap ≤ 0.05 compared with NC and bp ≤ 0.05 compared
  with CCl4 group. NC, normal control; CCl4, carbon tetrachloride; ALT, alanine aminotransferase;
  AST, aspartate aminotransferase; MDA, malondialdehyde; SOD, superoxide dismutase;
  GSH, glutathione.
