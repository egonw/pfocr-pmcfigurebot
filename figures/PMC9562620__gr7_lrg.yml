caption: 'Effects of XFBD on the expression of phosphorylated κB inhibits protein
  kinases (p-IKK), phosphorylated nucleus factor-κB (p–NF–κB) p65, and inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) protein in LPS-induced ALI model mice. (A) Protein expression
  levels of p-IKK was determined by immunohistochemistry. (B) Protein expression levels
  of p–NF–κB p65 was determined by immunohistochemistry. (C) Protein expression levels
  of iNOS was determined by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar = 50 μm (magnification:
  x200). (D) Results were expressed of p–NF–κB p65. (E) Results were expressed of
  p–NF–κB p65. (F) Results were expressed of p–NF–κB p65. Data are shown as mean ± SD
  by ANOVA. n = 3. ##p < 0.01 vs control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs LPS group.'
