caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of non-APAP liver injury. Low-magnitude toxic, metabolic,
  and pathogenic stress can be compensated for by molecular adaptive responses (listed
  in text) and the capacity of the liver to regenerate. However, when injury passes
  a certain threshold, the liver fails to adapt, and its compensatory mechanisms fall
  short, leading to cell death. The type of cell death signal and the signaling pathways
  that are activated dictate the cell death subroutine. While multiple cell death
  pathways exist, apoptosis, pyroptosis, MPT-driven necrosis, and necroptosis are
  the best studied. Apoptosis is the dominant cell death pathway in the liver, except
  in the case of APAP, which is clearly MPT-driven necrosis. While theoretically possible,
  to date no conclusive evidence for other cell death subroutines has been presented
  in hepatocytes. Abbreviations: APAP, acetaminophen; ARE, antioxidant response elements;
  Caspase, cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  GSH, glutathione; KEAP, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein; MOMP, mitochondrial outer
  membrane pore opening; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; NRF2, NF-E2â€“related
  factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCR, T-cell receptor; UPR, unfolded protein
  response.'
