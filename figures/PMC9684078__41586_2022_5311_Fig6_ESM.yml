figure_title: Filtering and clustering of pathways based on mean tumour enrichment
  and intra-tumour heterogeneity of enrichment
caption: a, Heatmaps showing clustering of pathways by enrichment level across tumours
  and enrichment variation within tumours. Hierarchical clustering revealed four distinct
  groups, named Group 1–4. Note units are scaled by column in both heatmaps b, Summary
  of mean enrichment level per Class. c, Summary of intra-tumour heterogeneity of
  enrichment per Class, measured by standard deviation. d, Fisher’s exact test (two-sided)
  results comparing pathway Groups to classes
