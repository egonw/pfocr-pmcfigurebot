caption: The increase of K63-linked deubiquitination and K48-linked ubiquitination
  of TRAF6/3 induced by ZC3H12A was recovered by CD40. (A, B) Overexpressing ZC3H12A
  induced by rCCL2 in THP1 and RAW264.7 Cells was detected by qPCR (A) and Western
  blotting (B). (C, D) IMD 0354 (IMD) was adopted to block the NF-κB signaling in
  RAW264.7 cells. Flow cytometry were performed to analyze the polariton phenotype
  in RAW264.7 cells in which ZC3H12A expression was knocked down (C) or upregulated
  (D). (E, F) Western blotting was performed to analyze the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in the ZC3H12A knockdown (E) or overexpressing (F) RAW264.7 cells. (G) Protein interaction
  network analysis for ZC3H12A was performed using the BioGRID online tools. (H) Structural
  pattern diagram of CD40 and the binding sites to TRAF6/3 were shown. (I) Venn diagram
  was presented to show the common binding proteins of ZC3H12A and CD40, based on
  the the BioGRID online tools. (J, K) ZC3H12A-Myc plasmid or control vector was cotransfected
  transiently with the TRAF6-Flag (J), TRAF3-Flag (K) plasmid or control vector into
  HEK-293T cells. Protein lysate was coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-tag (left) and
  Myc-tag (right) and measured through Western blotting method. (L) HEK-293T cells
  were transfected with UB-K63-HA, ZC3H12A-Myc, CD40-His and TRAF6-Flag (left), or
  TRAF3-Flag (right) plasmids. They have proceeded to IP and immunoblot analysis with
  anti-FLAG beads and were analyzed with anti-HA AB by immunoblot. (M, N) HEK-293T
  cells were transfected with ZC3H12A-Myc and TRAF6-Flag (left) or TRAF3-Flag (right).
  After 42 hours, cells were treated with 10, 25, 50 µM MG132 (M) or 20, 40 µM CQ
  (N) for 6 hour. The TRAF6-Flag (left) or TRAF3-Flag (right) expression was detected
  by Western blotting. (O) HEK-293T cells were transfected with ZC3H12A-Myc, CD40-His
  and TRAF6-Flag (left) or TRAF3-Flag (right) plasmids. After 42 hours, cells were
  treated with 25 µM MG132. The TRAF6-Flag (left) or TRAF3-Flag (right) expression
  was detected by Western blotting. (P) HEK-293T cells were transfected with UB-K48-HA,
  ZC3H12A-Myc, CD40-His and TRAF6-Flag (left), or TRAF3-Flag (right) plasmids. They
  had proceeded to IP and immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG beads and were analyzed
  with anti-HA AB by immunoblot. Results are shown as mean±SD. IMD (IMD 0354, an inhibitor
  of IKKβ). *P<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. ns, not significant.
