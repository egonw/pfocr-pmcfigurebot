caption: 'Vitexin suppressed the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways by
  blocking the ER stress caused by S. aureus on MAC-T cells. (a) The protein levels
  of PDI, BiP, Ero1-Lα, p-IRE1α, PERK, p-eIF2α, and CHOP were detected by Western
  blot on MAC-T cells. (c) The expression levels of JNK, ERK, p38, and p65 proteins
  in MAC-T cells were determined by Western blot. (b, d) Protein gray values were
  measured by the ImageJ software. Data was expressed as means ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. #p < 0.01 vs. the control group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the S. aureus group;
  ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the S. aureus group.'
