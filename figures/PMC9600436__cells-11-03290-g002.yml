caption: GO analysis of the 2110 intestine-enriched DEGs identified at 5 dpf. (A)
  GO analysis of the 2110 intestine-enriched DEGs under the GO_BP (upper panel) and
  GO_MF (lower panel) terms. Top 10 categories are shown here. (B–G) Heatmap showing
  the hierarchical clustering of representative DEGs in the categories (chosen from
  the top 10 under the GO_BP term) of ‘transmembrane transport’ (B), ‘proteolysis’
  (C), ‘lipid metabolic process’ (D), ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ €, ‘actin cytoskeleton/filament
  organization’ (F) and ‘glutathione metabolic pathway’ (G) in the three intestine
  and three liver RNA-seq samples.
