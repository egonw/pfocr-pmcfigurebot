caption: MTHFD2 enhanced proliferation of BC cells (A) Expression of MTHFD2 in T24
  and 5637 cells analysed by RT‐qPCR after transfection with three shRNA mimics for
  MTHFD2. (B) WB analysis after transfection. (C) Cell viability was measured using
  the CCK‐8 for T24 and 5637 cells. (D, E) Colony formation assay for T24 and 5637
  cells. (F, G) Representative immunofluorescence images of Ki67 staining in T24 and
  5637 cells. (Scale bar represents 20 μm) (ns vs. Control p ≥ 0.05; * vs. shNC p < 0.05;
  ** vs. shNC p < 0.01).
