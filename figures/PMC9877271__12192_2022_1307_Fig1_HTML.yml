caption: Schematic diagram of UPR signaling and ERAD pathway proteins under ER stress.
  In an inactive state, IRE-1 and PERK are associated with Grp78. However, under ER
  stress, when the levels of misfolded/unfolded proteins rise in the ER lumen, Grp78
  is competitively titrated by the excess of unfolded proteins, and this leads to
  activation of ATF6, PERK-1, and IRE-1 via oligomerization and autophosphorylation.
  Inactive ATF6 (90 kDa) translocates to the Golgi apparatus and becomes active (50 kDa),
  then translocates to the nucleus to guide adaptive transcriptional responses of
  downstream targets (Grp78, Grp94). Activated PERK stimulates eIF2α, and phosphorylates
  and induces ATF4, which leads to transcription of downstream gene targets (GADD153,
  GADD34). IRE-1 oligomerization catalyzes the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA to synthesize
  50 kDa active XBP-1 protein that can induce expression of Grp chaperones (Grp78,
  Grp94). The action of Grps enhances the protein folding capacity of cells along
  with ERAD protein (EDEM) that induces proteasomal degradation of misfolded/unfolded
  proteins. Image created with www.BioRender.com
