caption: In vitro antioxidant capacity of three T-CMs. A, Fe3+ concentration reduced
  to Fe2+ under treatment of a 20 μg/mL T-CM sample was used as the measurement result
  of FRAP. B, The ability of three T-CMs to scavenge DPPH free radicals was expressed
  as the IC50 values of the tea samples for DPPH free radical scavenging. C, The ability
  of three T-CMs to scavenge ABTS free radicals was expressed as the IC50 values of
  the tea samples for ABTS clearance. D, The ability of the three T-CMs to clear NADH-NBT-PNS
  was expressed as the IC50 values of the tea samples for NADH-NBT-PNS clearance.
  Values were expressed as Mean ± SD, which were repeated three times independently,
  and a, b and c represented P < 0.05.
