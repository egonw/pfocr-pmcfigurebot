caption: Planispine A acts in synergism with cisplatin. (A) Schematic protocol for
  the combination treatment. (B) Dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by
  planispine A or in combination with cisplatin (25 μM). (C) Graph representing IC50.
  (D) Dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by cisplatin or in combination
  with planispine A (5 μM). (E) Graph representing IC50 values. (F) Microscopy image
  showing morphology of cells when treated alone or combination with planispine A
  and cisplatin (20X). Scale bar, 0.2 μm. Cells were treated with DMSO (control),
  cis (cisplatin, 25 µM), PA (planispine A, 5 µM) or a combination. (G) Quantification
  of cell proliferation assay. Cells were pre-treated with PA (5 µM) for 16 h before
  treatment with cis (25 and 50 μM) for 64 h. Data represent percentage of growth
  compared with DMSO. **** p < 0.0001 vs. cisplatin.
