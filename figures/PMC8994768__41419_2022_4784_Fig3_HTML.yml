figure_title: SV restored dendritic extensions of calbindin-immunolabelled mature
  granule cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer in APP mice
caption: A Schematic representation of experimental design and timeline of SV treatment.
  B A confocal image of calbindin-immunostained mature granule cells with their axonal
  projections through the mossy fibers in the CA3 area (C’), cell bodies at the level
  of the dentate gyrus apex area (DG, D’), and their dendritic arborizations in the
  molecular layer (E’). Quantitative analysis revealed dramatic decreases in the intensity
  of calbindin-immunostained mossy fibers (C) and cell bodies (D) in APP mice compared
  to WT controls, deficits that were not improved by SV treatment. In contrast, the
  drastic decrease in calbindin-immunostained dendritic extensions in the DG molecular
  layer was normalized to control levels in APP mice treated with SV (E). ***p < 0.001,
  using two-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post-hoc test.
