caption: Metabolic pathways significantly differing in rumen metabolites among 3 species.
  (A) Significantly differing metabolic pathways between cattle and dzomo. (B) Significantly
  differing metabolic pathways between cattle and yak. (C) Significantly differing
  metabolic pathways between dzomo and yak. The X-axis and Y-axis represent the pathway
  impact and pathway enrichment, respectively. The redder the color indicate the smaller
  P-value from enrichment analysis, and the larger abscissa indicates the greater
  impact from the pathway topology analysis (n = 6 per species).
