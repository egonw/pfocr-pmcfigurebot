caption: 'Inhibitory effects of AKT inhibitor on MMP-9/RhoC expression. (a) MK2206
  2HCl inhibited MMP-9 expression in 4NQO-induced tongue tumors. (b) MK2206 2HCl inhibited
  RhoC expression in 4NQO-induced tongue tumors. All data are presented as the mean
  ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 as compared with the blank group, ##P < 0.01 as compared with the
  4NQO+captisol group. Magnification ×400. (c) MK2206 2HCl inhibited the RNA expression
  of MMP-9 and RhoC in CAL27 cells. (d) MK2206 2HCl inhibited the RNA expression of
  MMP-9 and RhoC in SCC25 cells. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01,
   ∗P < 0.05 as compared with the control group. (e) MK2206 2HCl inhibited the protein
  expression of MMP-9 and RhoC in OSCC cells.'
