caption: Distribution of matrix families common to the S. miltiorrhiza promoter sequences,
  i.e., HMGR1 (GU367911.1), HMGR2 (KF297286.1) and HMGR4 (KT921337.1) identified by
  the Common TFs tool. Black lines correspond to the promoter sequences. Each matrix
  family is marked with a semicircular coloured symbol. The figure shows families
  found on the positive and negative strands. P$AHBP, Arabidopsis homeobox proteins;
  P$L1BX, L1 box; P$MIIG, MYB IIG-type binding sites; P$DOFF, DNA binding with one
  finger; P$GTBX, GT box elements; P$MADS, MADS box proteins; P$MYBL, MYB-like proteins;
  P$MYBS, MYB proteins with single DNA binding repeat; P$NTMF, NAC factors with transmembrane
  motif; P$NACF, plant specific NAC proteins; P$KAN1, transcription repressor KANADI;
  P$WBXF, W box family; P$TODS, time-of-day-specific regulatory elements; P$NCS1,
  nodulin consensus sequence 1; P$SPF1, sweet potato DNA-binding factor with two WRKY
  domains; P$ZFAT, zinc finger proteins; P$LREM, light-responsive elements; P$PSPE,
  protein secretory pathway elements; P$CGCG, CGCG box binding proteins; P$PCDR, proteins
  involved in programmed cell death response; P$PNRE, plant nitrate-responsive elements;
  P$SCAP, stomatal carpenter.
