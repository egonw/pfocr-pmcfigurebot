figure_title: The composition of intestinal flora in the rats. The intestinal flora
  composition at (a) phylum, (b) family, and (c) genus levels. (d) LEfse analysis
  was performed to reveal the significant of abundant modules. Hollow nodes represent
  taxa with no significant difference among three groups, while green node indicates
  that these taxa show significant difference among three groups and are more abundant
  in the model group
