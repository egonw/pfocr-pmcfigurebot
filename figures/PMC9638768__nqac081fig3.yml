caption: Bacterial species and their contribution to pathways significantly different
  between the MOM and formula groups. (A) Contribution of 5 different species in the
  relative abundance of PYRIDNYCSYN-PWY, PWY-5136, KETOGLUCONMET-PWY, PWY-5913, and
  PWY-561 pathways. (B) Mean relative abundance ± SEM of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
  pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilisand Cronobacter malonaticus in
  the PT infant gut by feeding group. Differences calculated using Microbiome Multivariable
  Association Linear Models (MaASLin2). Model included the species as fixed effects,
  and infant as random effect. Analyses included 42 stool samples (21 in each group)
  from 27 infants. KETOGLUCONMET-PWY, ketogluconate metabolism; MOM, mother's own
  milk; PT, preterm; PWY, pathway; PWY-561, superpathway of glyoxylate cycle and fatty
  acid degradation; PWY-5136, fatty acid and β oxidations; PWY-5913, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; PYRIDNYCSYN-PWY, NAD biosynthesis.
