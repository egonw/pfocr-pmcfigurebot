caption: 'LMX1B depletion suppressed inflammatory cytokines secretion in OA rats.
  ELISA kits were used to determine the expression of IFN-γ (a), TNF-α (b), IL-6 (c),
  and PGE2 (e); (d) NO concentration was determined by the Griess reaction. ∗P < 0.05,
  compared with the control group; #P < 0.05, compared with the OA group. In the study,
  7 rats were used in each group.'
