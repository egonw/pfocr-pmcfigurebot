caption: 'Smad and NF-κB signaling pathways play a synergistic role in HO formation,
  and palovarotene inhibits HO formation by blocking the Smad and NF-κB signaling
  pathways. (a) The mRNA expression of OCN, SOX9, RUNX2, Smad1, Smad5, and ID1. Data
  are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. (b)
  Immunofluorescence against ID1 (n = 3). Scale bar = 25 μm. (c) Western blot analysis
  and relevant quantitative analysis of p-p65 and ID1. Data are means ± SD (n = 3)
  ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. (d) Immunofluorescence against
  p65 (n = 3). Scale bar = 25 μm. (e) Western blot analysis and relevant quantitative
  analysis of p65 and immunofluorescence against P65 in the previous coculture model
  series experiments (n = 3). Data are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01.
  #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. Scale bar = 25 μm.'
