figure_title: m6A landscape of established T1D is enriched in β-cell identity and
  function genes
caption: 'a, Summary scheme of the experimental plan. b, PCA plot of RNA-seq in human
  islets from control (black dots) (n = 20 biological independent samples) or established
  T1D (red dots) (n = 7 biological independent samples). PC, principal component.
  c, PCA plot of m6A-seq in human islets from control (black dots) (n = 20 biological
  independent samples) or established T1D (red dots) (n = 7 biological independent
  samples). d, Diagram representation of the upregulated (red), downregulated (blue)
  and unchanged genes (black) in human islets from control or T1D. e, Pathway enrichment
  analyses of upregulated and downregulated genes in human islets from T1D compared
  with controls. f, Metagene of m6A enriched peaks in control (blue) and T1D (red)
  human islets. UTR, untranslated region; CDS, coding sequence. g, Enrichment for
  known m6A consensus motif RRACH. h, Histogram showing the distribution of differential
  m6A loci log2 fold changes from T1D versus control human islets. i, Intersection
  of differentially expressed and m6A-methylated genes in T1D compared with control
  human islets. j, Pathway enrichment analyses of intersected genes in i. k, Intersection
  of DEGs in T1D β-cells compared with control from a published scRNA-seq dataset
  and our m6A dataset comparing the DMGs in established T1D with control human islets.
  l, Pathway enrichment analyses of intersected genes in k. m, Coverage plots of m6A
  peaks in β-cell identity genes in human islets from established T1D compared with
  controls. Plotted coverages are the median of the n replicates presented. Human
  islets: controls n = 20 and T1D n = 7 biologically independent samples. EndoC-βH1
  cells: n = 6 biologically independent samples. Statistical analyses were performed
  using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. P values of pathway enrichment analysis
  were calculated according to the hypergeometric test based on the number of physical
  entities present in both the pre-defined set and user-specified list of physical
  entities. Source numerical data are available in Source data.'
