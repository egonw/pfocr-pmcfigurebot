caption: Curcumin inhibits the CAF-induced chemoresistance of GC through the suppression
  of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis showing the expression
  of indicated proteins following co-culture with CAFs and with/without curcumin in
  MKN1, MKN74 and SNU668 cells. (B) Western blot analysis showing the expression of
  indicated proteins following co-culture with CAFs and with/without curcumin under
  5-FU treatment. (C) Relative viability of MKN74 and SNU668 cells co-cultured with
  fibroblast culture-conditioned media and treated with 5-FU and curcumin. (D) Western
  blot analysis showing changes in the expression of apoptotic markers, such as cleaved
  PARP, at 72 h following 5-FU and curcumin treatment of GC cells with or without
  co-culture with CAFs. (E) Flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI double-staining showing
  that 5-FU treatment with curcumin significantly increased the number of Annexin
  V+/PI+ cells. Data are presented as the mean values. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. 5-FU,
  5-fluorouracil; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; JAK, Janus-activated kinase;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
