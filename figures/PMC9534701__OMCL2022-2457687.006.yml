caption: T cell-derived exosomes upregulate NOX4 in cMVECs through ERK1/2 and MEK1/2
  pathway. This panel shows representative microphotographs of immunoblots and changes
  in levels of selected proteins in cMVECs in response to CD-4 exosomes in presence
  of ERK1/2 inhibitor (FR180204), MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), and NOX inhibitor (GKT136901).
  Cells were stimulated with exosomes for 16 h, n = 4. Protein levels were normalized
  to beta-tubulin, and phosphorylated proteins were additionally normalized to their
  respective nonphosphorylated forms. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 calculated
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD post hoc test versus control group or
  for indicated groups.
