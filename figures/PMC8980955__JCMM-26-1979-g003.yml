caption: 'Effect of NAD+on LPS‐induced AKI is associated with SIRT1. (A‐B) Immunofluorescence
  intensity of renal SIRT1 (red) in different groups (scale bars, 100 μm). (C) The
  relative mRNA expression of SIRT1 in kidney cortexes. (D) Representative Western
  blots analysis and quantitation of band density of SIRT1 expression in different
  groups. Each result was replicated in three independent experiments and all values
  are the mean ±SD (n = 3). *Significance compared with CON (WT) group (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01). #Significance compared with LPS (WT) group (#p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01).
  $Significance compared with CON (KO) group ($p < 0.05, $$p < 0.01). ^Significance
  compared with LPS (KO) group (^p < 0.05, ^^p < 0.01)'
