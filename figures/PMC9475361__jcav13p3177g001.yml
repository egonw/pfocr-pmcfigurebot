caption: LINC00674 is induced by hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner. (A) Hep3B and
  MHCC97H cells that were exposed to normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 8 hours
  were subjected to immunoblotting for HIF-1α. (B) Hypoxia upregulated LINC00674 expression
  in Hep3B and MHCC97H cells. (C) DMOG (1mM) treatment increased the expression of
  LINC00674 in HCC cells. (D) The lentivirus mediated shNRAs targeting HIF-1α (sh1α#1
  and sh1α#2) and non-targeting shRNA (NTC) were transduced into Hep3B and MHCC97H
  cells. The transfected cells were exposed to 1% O2 for 8 hours, and then western
  blot was conducted by using antibody against HIF-1α. (E) HIF-1α silencing reversed
  hypoxia-upregulated LINC00674 expression in HCC cells. (F) ChIP assays were performed
  using antibody against HIF-1α or IgG in HCC cells. *P<0.05.
