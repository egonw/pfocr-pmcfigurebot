caption: Enrichment and pathway analysis of STK38-related partners. (A) The experimentally
  verified STK38-binding proteins were obtained from the STRING website. (B) The correlation
  analysis between STK38 and selected binding genes including PKN2, NUMB, MAPK14,
  SP1 and SRPK1 using the GEPIA2 tool. (C) The corresponding heatmap data of different
  cancer types are displayed in detail. (D) GO and KEGG pathway analysis were performed
  based on the STK38-binding and interacted genes.
