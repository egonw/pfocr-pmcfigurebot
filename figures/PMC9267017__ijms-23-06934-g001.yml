caption: VEGF signaling pathway. After the VEGF level reaches the maximal concentration
  level at the leading edge of the vascular sprout, it binds to VEGFR and induces
  the migration of endothelial tip cells. Once VEGFR is activated, it leads to a series
  of downstream pathways. The transduction of downstream Raf-MEK-MAPK, P13K/AKT, (ERK)1/2/FAK,
  and other signals affects endothelial cell proliferation and survival. PI3K/Akt
  signaling is responsible for the expression of other molecules required for tumor
  cell invasion and metastasis, including Cdc42, Rho, and Rac proteins. VEGFA can
  activate c-Src and Yes proteins through VEGFR and phosphorylated adhesion factors,
  such as VE-cadherin and Î²-catenin, in the presence of TSAd to increase the vascular
  permeability. Furthermore, activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) affects
  vascular permeability by releasing nitric oxide in blood vessels. VEGFR can activate
  the P38/MAPK signaling pathway through Nck and Fyn binding, induce changes in the
  cytoskeleton, and promote tube formation in endothelial cells. VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; and VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.
