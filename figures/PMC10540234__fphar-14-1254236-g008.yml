caption: Effect of sulforaphane on MAPK and NF-κB (induced by sulforaphane are noted
  by using →, while the inhibition represented by ⊣ symbol). MAPK signal pathway is
  correlated with NF-κB. Sulforaphane can block the occurrence, development, invasion
  and migration of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting common upstream and downstream
  molecules, multiple receptors and ligands.
