caption: FGF2 is a target gene of miR-221-3p. (a) The binding sites of miR-221-3p
  were predicted by the starbase tool. (b) Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay verified
  the binding between miR-221-3p and FGF2. (c) ASMCs were transfected with miR-221-3p
  mimic, miR-221-3p inhibitor, and their negative controls, respectively. The expression
  of miR-221-3p was detected by RT-qPCR. (d) The expression of FGF2 mRNA was detected
  by RT-qPCR (e), (f) The expression of FGF2 protein was measured by using western
  blot analysis. Data from at least three independent experiments were presented as
  mean ± SD ∗P < 0.05.
