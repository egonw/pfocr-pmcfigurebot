caption: X-tile analysis of overall survival was performed using patient data from
  GSE39582 to determine the optimal cutoﬀ values for TRPV3 expression. The optimal
  cutoﬀ values highlighted by the black circles in left panel (A) are shown in histogram
  of the entire cohort (B), and Kaplan-Meier plot is displayed in the right panel
  (C). Immunohistochemical staining of CRC tumor tissues and paired normal tissue
  microarrays from patients at our cancer center (D). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
  of the identified 100 patients with low- and high-TRPV3 expression (E). TRPV3, transient
  receptor potential vanilloid 3; CRC, colorectal cancer.
article_title: TRPV3 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration by
  regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.
