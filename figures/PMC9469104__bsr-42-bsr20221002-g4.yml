figure_title: FBP1 promotes the EZH2/ H3K27me3 signaling pathway
caption: '(A) FBP1 was differentially enriched in epigenetic regulation of gene expression
  according to GSEA. (B) FBP1 was differentially enriched in PRC2 methylation of histone
  and DNA according to GSEA. (C) The relationship between FBP1 and EZH2 was determined
  based on TCGA dataset. (D) Heatmap of co-expression of FBP1 and EZH2 based on TCGA
  dataset. (E,F) The physical interaction between FBP1 and EZH2 in OC SKOV-3 cellswasdetected
  by Co-IP assay using FBP1 or EZH2 antibody, respectively. (G) Protein expression
  of FBP1, EZH2 and H3K27me3 in FBP1-C and FBP1-KD OC SKOV-3 cells as detected by
  Western blot analysis. (H) mRNA expression levels of FBP1 and EZH2 in ovarian cells
  as detected by qRT-PCR. (I) Relative protein expression levels of FBP1, EZH2 and
  H3K27me3 in FBP1-C and FBP1-KD OC SKOV-3 cells. (J) Expression of EZH2 and H3K27me3
  in normal, benign and malignant ovarian tissues as detected by IHC. (K) Expression
  of EZH2 and H3K27me3 in xenograft tumor tissues as detected by IHC. (L) mRNA expression
  of FBP1 and EZH2 in xenograft tumor tissues as detected by qRT-PCR. (M) Protein
  expression of FBP1, EZH2 and H3K27me3 in xenograft tumor tissues as detected by
  Western blot analysis. (N) Relative protein expression of FBP1, EZH2 and H3K27me3
  in xenograft tumor tissues. Note: The blots were cropped from the same gel; magnification:
