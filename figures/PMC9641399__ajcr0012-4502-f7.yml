caption: IVM inhibited the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and integrin β1/FAK pathways.
  (A) The expression of EMT-related proteins and MMP9 in HCT-116 cells treated with
  IVM and/or VCR for 48 h was determined by Western blotting analysis using GAPDH
  as internal control. (B and C) The activation of integrin β1/FAK (B) and Wnt/β-catenin
  (C) pathway and the expression of their downstream signaling molecules in MCF-7
  cells treated with IVM and/or ADR for 48 h were determined by Western blotting analysis
  using GAPDH as whole cell lysate internal control. Histone H3 and β-tubulin were
  used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction marker, respectively. Cells treated
  with vehicle served as the control. The blots shown were representative of two independent
  experiments.
