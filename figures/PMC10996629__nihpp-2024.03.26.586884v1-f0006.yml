figure_title: Inhibition of β-catenin signaling pathway rescues E-cadherin and ZO-1
  downregulation in SGEF KD cells
caption: (A) Total cell lysates from confluent CTRL, SGEF KD, and iCRT3 treated SGEF
  KD MDCK cells were analyzed by WB for E-cadherin, Slug and ZO-1. Tubulin was used
  as a loading control. (B-D) Quantification and ANOVA analysis from WB data in (A).
  Letters indicate Tukey post-hoc significant differences between groups. (E) IF of
  endogenous ZO-1 and E-cadherin confluent CTRL (non-treated), SGEF KD, and iCRT3
  treated SGEF KD MDCK cells. The yellow lines indicate the region displayed in the
  XZ cross-section. All images are 3 µm max projections of the subapical domain (ZO-1
  signal used for centering) (F) T.E.E.R. was measured in CTRL, SGEF KD, SGEF/Slug
  dKD, and iCRT3 treated SGEF KD MDCK cells grown in permeable filters. The graph
  represents the difference in electrical resistance as a percentage of CTRL cells
  (n=4). Scale bar 10µm (XY) and 5µm (XZ).
