caption: P2Y2 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through the Src-EGFR axis.
  (A, B) P2Y2-silenced cells and control cells were treated with 100 μM ATP for 20
  min. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of p-PI3K. (C, D) Cells
  were further pretreated with Dasatinib and AG1478 for 1 h, and then adding ATP (100
  μM) for 24 h, western blotting results showed that further reduced the expressions
  of p-PI3K and p-AKT. (E) Colony formation assay was used to evaluate the effect
  of PI3K/AKT inhibitors on in vitro proliferation after incubation with ATP for 14
  days. (F) Transwell invasion assays evaluated the effect of PI3K/AKT inhibitors
  on in vitro invasion after incubation with ATP for 24 h. The scale bar is 500 μm.
  (G, H) Wound healing evaluated the effect of PI3K/AKT inhibitors on in vitro migration
  after incubation with ATP for 24 and 48 h. The scale bar is 1 mm. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD (error bars indicate SD). Three independent experiments were performed
  (n = 3); t-test was employed for testing the difference between the two groups.
  ANOVA for testing the distinctions of the groups. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001 vs control.
