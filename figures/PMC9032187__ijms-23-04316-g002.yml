caption: Comprehensive analysis using ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA). (A) Principal
  component analysis (PCA) of normalized metabolic data. Percentage values on axes
  represent contribution rate of first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2,
  respectively) to total variation. (B) Heat map of hierarchical cluster analysis.
  Columns indicate WT and AK3KO groups. Rows indicate normalized levels of each metabolite.
  Dendrogram of each heat map shows relationship to normalized metabolite level patterns.
  (C) Ranking of known pathways using IPA; p-values calculated using IPA software
  are displayed as inverse values. Orange line indicates proportion of genes included
  in each pathway. (D) Upstream regulators identified using IPA; expected activators
  and inhibitors are shown in red and blue, respectively.
