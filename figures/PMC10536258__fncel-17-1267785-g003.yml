caption: 'Paracrine characteristics of cerebrovascular pericytes. (1) participation
  in angiogenesis and maturation: this biological process is mainly due to the communication
  between pericytes and endothelial cells. VEGF/VEGFR1 pathway is mainly involved
  in vascular budding, PDGF-BB-PDGFR-β pathway is mainly involved in vascular stability,
  and TGF-β pathway is mainly involved in vascular maturation; (2) maintenance of
  the blood–brain barrier permeability: Ang/Tie2 and MFSD2A pathways play a crucial
  role in regulating the vascular permeability, Sonic Hedgehog from astrocytes can
  also stabilize the permeability of the blood–brain barrier by acting on endothelial
  cells; (3) regulation of capillary blood flow: prostaglandin E2 released by astrocytes
  can actively relax pericytes, but this process requires the release of NO to inhibit
  the synthesis of 20-HETE which constricts blood vessels; (4) regulation of neuroinflammation:
  this process mainly involves the communication between endothelial cells, pericytes
  and astrocytes. Pericytes promote the activation of astrocytes and promote the expression
  of pro-inflammatory factors in endothelial cells by secreting IL-1β and TNF-α, and
  pericytes also can release CXCL1 on white blood cells. Abbreviated specification:
  VEGFA-vascular endothelial growth factor A; VEGFR1: Vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 1; VEGFR2: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; VEGF-A165:vascular
  endothelial growth factor A165; PDGFRβ: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β;
  PDGF-BB: Platelet-Derived Growth Factor BB; TGFβ: Transforming growth factor beta;
  TGFβ-R2: Transforming growth factor beta, type II receptor; Ang1: angiopoietin-1;
  Tie2: TEK receptor tyrosine kinase; MFSD2A: major facilitator superfamily domain-containing
  protein 2a; 20-HETE: 20-hydroxy Arachidonic Acid; IL-1β: interleukin-1β; IL-1: interleukin-1;
  IL-6: interleukin-6; IL-12: interleukin-12; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α; CXCL1:
  Recombinant Human C-X-C Motif Chemokine 1; MCP-1: Monocyte Chemotactic Protein 1.'
