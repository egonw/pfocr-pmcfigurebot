caption: GSEA. GSEA was performed in the HCB-514 and HaCaT cells. The GSEA algorithm
  calculates an enrichment score reflecting the degree of overrepresentation at the
  top or bottom of the ranked list of the genes included in a gene set in a ranked
  list of all genes present in the nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel. The analysis
  demonstrates that the signaling pathways (A) gap junction, (B) calcium signaling
  pathway, (C) long-term potentiation and (D) apoptosis were enriched in HCB-514 cells.
