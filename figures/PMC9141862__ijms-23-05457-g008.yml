caption: (a) MapMan-based “metabolic overview map” of DEGs in the “S3_HG vs. S1_HG”
  group, including modules for phenyl propane, lignans, flavonoids, mangiferylic acid,
  and wax. The small heat map in each section of the figure shows the DEGs mapped
  to that pathway, with a small square indicating a gene. The color of the square
  indicates the expression of that gene in the third stage, down-regulated in green
  and up-regulated in red. (b) General phenylpropanoid metabolism, lignin biosynthesis,
  and flavonoid biosynthesis metabolic pathways in citrus. Differentially expressed
  genes associated with (c) monophenol, phenylpropanoid, and lignin biosynthesis,
  and (d) flavonoid biosynthesis metabolism during fruit development and ripening.
  Red indicates up-regulation, and green indicates down-regulation. Heatmap of DEGs
  was drawn using the log2Foldchange value obtained from the pairwise comparison of
  samples. S3/S1, comparison group of S3 and S1; S2/S1, comparison group of S2 and
  S1; S3/S2, comparison group of S3 and S2. Red and green indicate up-regulation and
  down-regulation, respectively, in the former of the comparisons.
