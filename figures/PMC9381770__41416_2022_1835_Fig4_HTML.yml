figure_title: Decreased ALDH1L2 inhibits ROS-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells after
  irradiation
caption: a GSEA enrichment plot of CRC samples from TCGA dataset. NES and P-value
  were calculated in the plot. b Heatmap showing the transcription level of genes
  in peroxisome pathway. Cells were treated with 6 Gy irradiation. P-value were shown
  in the plot. c Protein expression of ALDH1L2, NF-κB, pp65, iκBα, CAT, SOD2 and TXN
  with silencing ALDH1L2 in HCT-15 and HCT 116 cells or forced expression of ALDH1L2
  in SW480 and HT-29 cell. β-actin served as a control. d Overlay of histograms by
  flow cytometry. Mean of DHE in e cells with ALDH1L2 knockdown or f cells with ALDH1L2
  overexpressed. g–j Apoptosis of different cell lines and its negative control by
  flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in all quarters were addressed. Cells were
  treated with 6 Gy irradiation. k, l Bar graph to show the percentage of apoptosis
  cells after irradiation. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
