caption: Cell cycle analysis provides important DEGs regulating cell cycle differences
  between the high-OA and normal seedling leaves. (A) RNA velocity analysis of all
  cells. The number 0–11 indicates the cell cluster 0–11 in the fad2 and normal peanut
  seedling leaf t-SNE map. (B) Cell cycle phase distribution; NC indicates the non-cycling
  cell population. The scaleplate of out circular represents the total cell number
  in each cell cycle phase. (C) The histogram plot shows the distribution of cells
  from respective cell cycle phases. (D) The histogram plot shows the DEGs in different
  cell cycle phases. (E) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs in different cell cycle phases.
  (F) Newly identified genes for distinguishing leaf cell genome replication states.
  (G) Venn diagram showing 1113 core DEGs between cell-cycle-related DEGs, cell cluster
  DEGs, and cell development trajectory DEGs. (H) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of 1113 core DEGs. (I) Cell expression distribution of eight core TFs identified
  from 1113 core DEGs.
