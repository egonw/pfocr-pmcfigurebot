caption: Hierarchical quorum sensing network in Staphylococcus aureus. Autoinducing
  peptide (AIP) synthesis and mechanism of action in S. aureus. A two-component signal
  transduction pathway underlies AIP-mediated quorum sensing in S. aureus (AgrC and
  AgrA). RNAII and RNAIII regions’ P2 and P3 promoters are correspondingly activated
  by phosphorylated AgrA. AIP is synthesized as a result of RNAII expression, and
  RNAIII expression controls the synthesis of exoproteins, virulence genes, and δ-hemolysin
  genes while inhibiting the synthesis of adhesins.
