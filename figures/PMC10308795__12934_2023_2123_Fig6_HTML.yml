caption: 'A. Production and consumption rates of NADPH (estimated from the 13C-MFA
  results) and specific glycerol uptake rates for each strain. B. FBA results. The
  y-axis on the left side shows the sum of the fluxes for the main ATP-consuming reactions.
  The y-axis on the right side shows the percentage of pyruvate entering the mitochondria
  and the TCA cycle. To do so, the ratio of the fluxes of PYK (the main cytosolic
  pyruvate producing reaction) and PDH was calculated. Abbreviations: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GAME, growth associated maintenance energy; NGAME, non-growth associated
  maintenance energy; UG/PPP: upper glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway reactions;
  Acetyl-CoAcyt: Cytosolic acetyl-CoA production pathway; VPDH/PYK: Ratio between
  the fluxes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and the pyruvate kinase (PYK) reactions'
article_title: High throughput 13C-metabolic flux analysis of 3-hydroxypropionic acid
  producing Pichia pastoris reveals limited availability of acetyl-CoA and ATP due
  to tight control of the glycolytic flux.
