caption: Proposed biosynthesis pathway for epichloëcyclins. (A) Proposed and alternative
  (B) epichloëcyclin biosynthesis pathways. The signal peptide, leader peptide, and
  follower peptide are displayed in red, orange, and gray small circles, respectively.
  The kexin B recognition sequence and core peptides are displayed in purple and blue
  big circles respectively, and purple scissors denote the kexin B cleavage site.
  The dotted lines show the proposed cutting sites by other peptidase protease.
