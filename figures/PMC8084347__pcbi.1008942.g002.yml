figure_title: Global analysis of metabolic dependency data reveals context-specific
  pathway essentialities
caption: A) Metabolic pathway activity was inferred using ssGSEA for 300 adherent
  cell lines cultured in RPMI and correlated to gene dependency data from The Cancer
  Dependency Map (DepMap). Correlation coefficients were then ranked and Genetic Pathway
  Dependency Enrichment Analysis (Genetic PDEA) was run using the KEGG metabolic pathways
  (see ). Hierarchical clustering was performed on the Genetic PDEA normalized enrichment
  scores (NES). Results for pathways with FDR < 0.25 are plotted. Dots are colored
  according to their NES and sized according to the -log10 of the false discovery
  rate (FDR). Numerical values for each pathway can be found in . Results shown in
  B and C are highlighted with a black outline. B) Cancer cell dependency on Folate
  Biosynthesis (hsa00790) was increased when One-Carbon Pool by Folate (hsa00670)
  pathway activity was high. The scatter plots of pathway activity NES and gene dependency
  (-CERES) for leading-edge genes QDPR and ALPI are shown. C) Dependency on One-Carbon
  Pool by Folate metabolism (hsa00670) is increased when TCA cycle (hsa00020) activity
  is increased. The scatter plots of pathway activity NES and gene dependency (-CERES)
  for leading-edge genes MTR and MTHFD1 are shown.
