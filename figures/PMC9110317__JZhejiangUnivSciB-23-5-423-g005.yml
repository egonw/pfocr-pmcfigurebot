figure_title: 'miR3202 functioned as a sponge for lnc78583 and HOXB13. (a) The binding
  sites of miR3202 with lnc78583 and HOXB13. (b) qRT-PCR analysis of miR3202 after
  treatment with or without LPS in FHC. (c, d) qRT-PCR analyses of lnc78583 and miR3202
  after overexpressing lnc78583 or not. (e) The qRT-PCR analysis indicates that miR3202
  mimics and inhibitors were successfully transfected into FHC. (f) The qRT-PCR analysis
  indicates that HOXB13 is downregulated after transfecting with miR3202 mimics. (g)
  miR3202 expression level after treatment with hucMSC-Ex by qRT-PCR. (h) The protein
  expression levels of p-NF-‍κB and NF-‍κB by western blot after transfecting with
  miR3202 mimics and inhibitor. (i) The gray value of p-NF-‍κB protein expression
  related to NF-‍κB after transfecting with miR3202 mimics and inhibitor was analyzed
  by ImageJ software. Group CON stands for transfecting with EV but without LPS treatment,
  group EV stands for transfecting with EV after LPS treatment, and group lnc78583
  stands for transfecting with lnc78583-overexpressing vector after LPS treatment.
