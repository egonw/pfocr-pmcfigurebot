caption: IL-2 and IL-15 enhance the quantity and cytotoxicity of patient autologous
  NK cells. Unculture and IL-2 and IL-15 costimulation culture 3 days and 7 days patient
  autologous CD3−CD56+ NK cell in PBMC detected by FACS (a). The statistical results
  of CD3−CD56+ NK cell in PBMC (a). Unculture and IL-2 and IL-15 costimulation culture
  3 days and 7days CD3−CD56+ NK cell morphology observed under a microscope, respectively
  (b). The statistical results of CD3−CD56+ NK cell quantity in per microliter (b).
  Cytotoxic cytokine (CD107a and IFN-R) expression level of NK cells was detected
  by FACS (c). The proportion of CD107a + IFN-R NK cells (c). For comparisons, Student's
  t-test was performed in two group, or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed
  in multiple groups. ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
