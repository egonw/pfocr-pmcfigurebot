caption: Effect of anti-VEGFR-2 treatments in resistant and mutated NSCLC cell lines.
  A total of 8000 H2170-ER, H358-ER, H1975, and H3255 NSCLC cells were treated with
  diluent (control), 5 µM Erlotinib treatment, 12 µM ZM treatment, and a combination
  of 5 µM Erlotinib and 12 µM ZM. Cell viability was assessed with an MTT cell viability
  assay to study the efficacy of Erlotinib in conjunction with ZM, a VEGFR-2 inhibitor,
  relative to the control. In (A) H2170-ER cells, (B) H358-ER cells, (C) H1975-ER
  cells, and (D) H3255-ER cells, percent cell viability was measured. Six duplicates
  from each cell line were used for each treatment group. Absorbance was recorded
  and percent viability was calculated using appropriate controls for each sample.
  Statistical analysis was performed, and the results were found to be statistically
  significant (* = p < 0.05) by way of two-tailed t-test analysis. All treatment groups
  showed statistically significant results compared to the diluent. Treatment groups
  without an asterisk (*) did not show statistically significant results. One asterisk
  (*) denotes statistical significance in all the bars with one asterisk, two asterisks
  (**) suggest statistical significance between all the bars with two asterisks and
  three asterisks (***) suggests that the data is significant in comparison to both
  one and two asterisks.
