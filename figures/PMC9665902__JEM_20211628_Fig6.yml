caption: Endothelial CCL2 was inhibited through an adrenomedullin/Gαs/cAMP signaling
  pathway. (a) MLECs (ECs) transfected with control siRNA (cont) or with siRNA directed
  against Gnas were cultured with B16-F10 (TCs) for 48 h (co-culture, right) or were
  cultured alone for 48 h, lysed and then mixed with B16-F10 lysates (mix, left).
  The expression level of ADM in mixed lysates or lysates of co-cultures was analyzed
  by Western blotting. The bar diagram represents the relative densitometric values
  based on Fiji software (n = 3 independent experiments). (b) MLECs transfected with
  control siRNA (cont) or with siRNA directed against Gnas were cultured alone or
  together with LLC1 cells for 24 h, and ADM protein concentrations in cell supernatants
  was determined by ELISA (n = 5 independent experiments). (c and d) B16-F10 cells
  were cultured for 24 h with endothelial cell (EC) medium or with conditioned endothelial
  cell medium (CM) of MLECs transfected with control siRNA (CM control) or siRNA directed
  against Gnas (CM Gαs KD). ADM protein concentrations in cell supernatants were determined
  by ELISA (c; n = 5 independent experiments), or the expression level of ADM was
  determined by Western blot (d; n = 3 independent experiments). (e and f) HUVECs
  transfected with control siRNA or siRNA directed against GNAS or CALCRL were incubated
  without or with 10 nM of adrenomedullin for 3 h (e), or with 50 µM db-cAMP for 24
  h (f). Thereafter, the CCL2 expression was determined by qRT-PCR analysis (n = 4
  independent experiments). (g) HUVECs transfected with control siRNA or siRNA directed
  against GNAS or CALCRL or CCL2 were incubated without or with 10 nM adrenomedullin
  for 24 h, and the CCL2 concentration in cell supernatants was determined (n = 3
  independent experiments). (h) Endothelial cells were isolated from B16-F10 tumors
  grown in control or EC-Gαs-KO mice by FACS, and expression of the indicated genes
  was determined by qRT-PCR (n = 3 mice for each genotype). Data represent mean values
  ± SEM; *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; n.s., non-significant (two-way
  ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc test [a and e–g], one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post
  hoc test [b–d], and two-tailed Student’s t test [h]).
