caption: β-glucan supplementation activates the creatine signaling pathway in plasma.
  (A) Venn diagrams resuming the number of plasma metabolites significantly changed
  (p < 0.05) in the placebo group and β-glucan group. (B) The heatmap showing changes
  in the relative content of plasma metabolites after β-glucan treatment. (Wilcoxon
  rank sum tests;). (C) Major metabolic pathways involved in the differentially enriched
  metabolites after β-glucan treatment (count indicates metabolites enrolled in each
  pathway). (D) Reaction steps for creatine pathway. Metabolites increased after β-glucan
  treatment are shown in red, whereas the metabolites decreased are shown in green.
