caption: Involvement of the cAMP-PKA pathway in the exendin-4-induced suppression
  of GABA currents. A Representative recordings of a GC showing that perfusion with
  400 μmol/L 8-Br-cAMP reduces the GABA currents. In the presence of 8-Br-cAMP, exendin-4
  no longer suppresses the currents. B Bar chart summarizing the effects of 8-Br-cAMP
  and exendin-4 on the GABA current amplitudes. **P <0.01. C Representative recordings
  from two GCs, showing that internal infusion of 50 μmol/L Rp-cAMP (left) or 1 μmol/L
  KT-5720 (right) eliminates the exendin-4-induced reduction of the GABA currents.
  D Bar chart summarizing the effects of Rp-cAMP and KT-5720 on GABA currents. P <0.01,
  n.s., P >0.05, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test.
