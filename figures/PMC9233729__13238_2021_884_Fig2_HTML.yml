caption: Mouse Bend5 overexpression promotes EpiLC induction from mESCs and leads
  to transcriptomic changes. (A) 293T cells transiently co-expressing HA-tagged mouse
  Bend5 with GST-tagged mouse Oct4 (left) or mouse Sox2 (right) were analyzed in GST-pulldown
  assays. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and western blotted with the
  indicated antibodies. Cells co-expressing HA-Oct4 and GST-Sox2 served as positive
  controls. GST or HA-tagged GFP were used for negative controls. (B) Stella-GFP reporter
  mESCs stably expressing Flag-tagged Bend5 were either western blotted to confirm
  Bend5 expression (top) or differentiated into EpiLCs (middle) where bright-field
  and fluorescence microscopy was performed at the indicated time points. Cells expressing
  vector alone were used as controls. The same cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry
  (bottom), where the percentage of GFP+ cells before and after induction was calculated.
  Error bars represent mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments. Significance was
  determined using two-tailed t test. ***P < 0.001. (C) Based on RNA-seq data using
  control and Bend5-expressing mESCs collected from EpiLC induction assays, the number
  of genes with >2-fold change following induction was plotted as shown. (D) Based
  on RNA-seq data, a select list of genes differentially up- or down-regulated following
  EpiLC induction in control vs. Bend5-expressing cells were plotted in the heatmap.
  (E) Stella-GFP reporter mESCs stably expressing vector alone or Bend5 were induced
  to differentiate into EpiLCs. GFP positive cells were FACS sorted at day 0 (D0)
  or 2 (D2) for RT-PCR analysis. Fold change (D2/D0) was calculated and plotted as
  shown. Fosb and Fos function in the TGFβ signaling pathway. Car4 encodes a metabolic
  enzyme. Fgf5 and Fgf15 are epiblast-specific genes. Rab25, Gadd45g, and H19 are
  developmentally regulated genes. Error bars represent mean ± SD, n = 3 independent
