figure_title: HNF1A-AS1 maintains stemness of GCSCs through Wnt/β-catenin pathway
caption: A Western blotting assay was used to identify the effect of HNF1A-AS1 on
  cancer stemness markers. B, C TOP/FOP-flash reporter plasmid was transfected in
  GC cells, and luciferase activity was detected (n = 3). D, E qRT-PCR analysis of
  β-catenin, CMYC, OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG expression in MKN-45 and BGC-823 cells overexpressing
  HNF1A-AS1 or negative control (n = 3). F, G Immunofluorescence staining assay indicating
  the localization of β-catenin in GC cells. Confocal micrographs of β-catenin. Original
  magnification, ×630. H Western blotting assay was used to determine the effect of
  HNF1A-AS1 on the intracellular localization of β-catenin. I–K The expression of
  CMYC, OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in MKN-45 and BGC-823 cells treated with iCRT14 and DMSO
  were detected by western blotting and qRT-PCR. L, M CCK8 assay to detect cell viability
  after addition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor iCRT14 (n = 3). Data are representative
  as the mean ± SD. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (B–E), one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (J, K), two-way ANOVA test (L, M). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001.
