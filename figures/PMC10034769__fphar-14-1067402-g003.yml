caption: 'Effects of Urolithin A (UA) on LPS-mediated OS in ALI. (A) Typical images
  showed the ROS level in BEAS-2B cells. (B) Typical images showed MitoSox in BEAS-2B
  cells. (C–F) MDA, CAT, GSH, and SOD activities in the mouse lung tissues. All data
  were shown as mean ± SD. ##p < 0.01, **p < 0.01 in comparison to control and LPS
  groups, respectively.'
