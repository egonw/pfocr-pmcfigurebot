caption: 'The origin of cancer associated fibroblast (CAFs): the main original cell
  of CAFs are tissue normal fibroblasts, stellate cells, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial
  cells, epithelial cells, adipocytes cells and perivascular cells. These cells can
  transform into CAFs by Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and Endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EndMT) or be activated by cytokines including TGF-β, SDF-1, WNT-3, IGF-3,
  CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL2.'
