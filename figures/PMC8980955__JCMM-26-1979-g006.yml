caption: 'Effect of NAD+ on LPS‐induced apoptosis in renal tissues. (A‐B) Representative
  images of the TUNEL staining on kidneys (scale bars, 100 μm) and counted percentages
  of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase‐mediated dUTP nick end‐labelling (TUNEL)‐positive
  cells. (C‐F) Representative immunoblotting analysis of Bax, Bcl‐2 and cleaved‐caspase3.
  Each result was replicated in three independent experiments, and all values are
  the mean ±SD (n = 3). *Significance compared with CON (WT) group (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
