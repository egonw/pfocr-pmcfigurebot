caption: Ubiquitination and deubiquitination in proximal T cell signaling. Overview
  of known ubiquitin E3 ligases (orange) and deubiquitinating enzymes (blue) involved
  in regulating the initiation of T cell receptor signaling (green). Details are described
  in the main text of the manuscript. The T cell signaling pathway is indicated by
  black arrows. Modifications that dampen T cell receptor signaling are indicated
  by red arrows. Ubiquitin modifications enhancing T cell signaling are indicated
  by blue arrows.
