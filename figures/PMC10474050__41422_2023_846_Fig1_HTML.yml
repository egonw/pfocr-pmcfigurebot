figure_title: Single-cell transcriptome analysis of 3D-cultured human post-implantation
  embryos
caption: scRNA-seq data are from 10× Genomics platform. a Uniform Manifold Approximation
  and Projection (UMAP) visualization of single-cell transcriptome datasets from 3D-cultured
  human post-implantation embryos at different embryonic days. b UMAP plots of genes
  that were differentially expressed in four different populations. c UMAP visualization
  of all cell types after excluding trophoblast subpopulation. d Proportions of the indicated
  subtypes of cells in extended cultured human embryos at different developmental
  time points according to the results of scRNA-seq data. e Dot plots of candidate
  genes specific for cell subtypes. f Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  among different cell subtypes displayed in c. Representative genes (left) and KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis (right) are shown. Padj of Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test < 0.05,
  log2 (FC) > 0.25 and expressed in > 25% of cells of the given cluster. g RNA velocity
  vectors projected onto the UMAP-based embeddings of the single-cell transcriptome
  dataset from human embryos shown in c. h The hierarchical clustering tree of different
  cell subpopulations. i The inferred BMP signaling pathway network. Circle sizes
  are proportional to the number of cells in each subpopulation and line weight represents
  the communication probability. See also Supplementary information, Fig. .
