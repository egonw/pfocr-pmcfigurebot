caption: DARS2 overexpression was related to worse prognosis in LUAD. (A, B) DARS2
  mRNA expression from TCGA Lung Cancer dataset. (C) qRT‐PCR assay was performed to
  analyze DARS2 expression from paired LUAD and para‐carcinoma tissues. (D) Western
  blot was conducted to detect the DARS2 expression in five paired LUAD and para‐carcinoma
  tissues. (E) GSEA revealed that DARS2 was enriched in the pathway of “NON‐SMALL
  LUNG CANCER.” (F‐H) Survival analysis based on TCGA and GEO database showed that
  DARS2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis.
