caption: 'The framework of two sample Mendelian randomization analyses. Mendelian
  randomization model of LTL and risk of IMIDs. MR analysis can provide valid causality
  when three core assumptions are satisfied as follows: 1) the selected instruments
  of genetic variations are robustly associated with the exposure (LTL). 2) The selected
  instruments of SNPs should not be linked to any potential confounders of the relationship
  between exposure and outcomes. 3) The selected instruments of genetic variants should
  have no direct correlation with the outcome by any other causal pathway except through
  the way of exposure. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; LTL, leukocyte telomere
  length; MR, Mendelian randomization; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; IBD, inflammatory
  bowel disease; UC, ulcerative colitis; CD, Crohnâ€™s disease; AS, ankylosing spondylitis;
  SS, sicca syndrome; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; T1D, type 1 diabetes; PSC, primary
  sclerosing cholangitis; IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; AD, atopic dermatitis.'
