caption: A high level of putrescine caused AAA via VSMCs phenotype switching. A–D)
  Twenty‐eight‐day infusion of Ang II or saline in 3‐month‐old ApoE−/− male mice challenged
  with or without 1% putrescine in drinking water. Putrescine concentrations of ApoE−/−
  mice plasma challenged with Ang II or saline. n = 6 per group. Student's t‐test,
  **p <  0.01 (A). The timeline of putrescine feeding and Ang II infusion (B). Representative
  morphology of the aortas (C). The quantification of maximal suprarenal aortic diameters
  measured ex vivo, the incidence of AAA, and the death rate of mice. The red part
  in a histogram is the incidence and death rate of AAA model mice. The blue part
  in a histogram is the non‐disease and survival rate of AAA model mice (D). n = 8
  for water‐administered and n = 6 for putrescine‐administered. Student's t‐test,
  *p <  0.05. E,F) Representative western blotting (E) and quantification (F) from
  aortas of C57BL/6J mice challenged with or without 1% putrescine in drinking water
  with 14 days postperfusion of elastase. Student's t‐test, *p <  0.05. G) Putrescine
  concentrations of aortas of GSDMDfl/flSM22Cre+/− and GSDMDfl/fl mice with 14 days
  postperfusion of elastase. FW, fresh weight. Student's t‐test, n = 10 per group,
  ***p <  0.001. H–J) Fourteen‐day postperfusion of elastase in 3‐month‐old GSDMDfl/flSM22Cre+/−
  male mice challenged with or without 1% putrescine in drinking water. n = 6 per
  group. The timeline of putrescine feeding and elastase induction (H). Representative
  morphology of the aortas (I). The quantification of maximal infrarenal aortic diameters
  measured ex vivo. Student's t‐test, ***p <  0.001 (J). K) Schematic diagram of the
  putrescine metabolic pathway.
