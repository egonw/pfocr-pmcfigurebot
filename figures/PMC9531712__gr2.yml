caption: Contribution of Genetic Aberrations in Wnt Pathways in Gastrointestinal CancersMutations
  or fusions in Wnt pathway genes are common in gastrointestinal cancers. Of these,
  the majority occur in downstream components such as CTNNB1 and APC, which are expected
  to be largely independent of extracellular Wnt ligands, although ligand-dependent
  aberrations such as RNF43 mutations or RSPO2/3 fusions are also observed. Mutation
  data from cBio Portal, (; ), using curated non-overlapping datasets, n = 1564 samples
  for CRC, n = 922 for pancreatic cancer, n = 1111 for liver cancer, n = 795 for gastric
  cancer, n = 588 for biliary cancer. CBio Portal accessed 27th Oct 2021. Since RSPO2/3
  fusions are not captured in cBio, prevalence is per literature reports ().
