caption: Immunohistochemical images of normal lung alveolar tissue showing presence
  of macrophages stained for CD68 (a) and SIRPAa (b). Typical immunohistohemical images
  of non-small cell lung carcinomas with (c) low infiltration of the tumor stroma
  by CD68+ macrophages (score 1); (d) medium infiltration of the tumor stroma by CD68+
  macrophages (score 2); (e) intense infiltration of the tumor stroma by CD68+ macrophages
  (score 3); (f) lack of SIRPα+ macrophages in the tumor stroma (score 0); (g) low
  infiltration of the tumor stroma by SIRPα+ macrophages (score 1); (h) intense infiltration
  of the tumor stroma by SIRPα+ macrophages (score 2). All images are shown at ×20
  magnification. Thick arrows show areas of macrophage presence. As noted in all images
  CD68 and SIRPα were not expressed by cancer cells (thin arrows).
