figure_title: Molecular pathways involved in intrauterine ductus arteriosus (DA) relaxation
  (A) and molecular pathways involved in postnatal DA constriction (B)
caption: A, Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)–derived NO, CO, and atrial natriuretic
  peptide (ANP) initiate the cGMP signaling cascade by activating membrane‐bound or
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). cGMP subsequently activates protein kinase G (PKG),
  which decreases the intracellular calcium concentration by inhibiting voltage‐dependent
  calcium channels (VDCCs) and promoting calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
  PKG also activates voltage‐gated potassium channel (Kv), ATP‐gated potassium channel
  (KATP), and large conductance calcium‐activated potassium channel (BKCa), which
  trigger potassium efflux and membrane hyperpolarization, resulting in VDCC inhibition.
  In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), working through the prostaglandin E2 receptor
  4 (EP4), activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenosine also activates adenylyl cyclase,
  which, in turn, activates the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade. PKA
  activates Kv, KATP, and BKCa and inhibits myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which
  subsequently reduces phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs), thereby preventing
  vasoconstriction. B, Increased O2 tension increases the concentration of intracellular
  calcium via several pathways. First, O2 stimulates mitochondrial production of ATP
  and H2O2, which inhibit vasodilating KATP and Kv. H2O2 also activates the ras homologous
  protein (Rho)/rho‐associated protein kinase (ROCK) cascade, which promotes constriction
  by inhibiting MLC phosphatase (MLCP)–mediated MLC dephosphorylation. In addition,
  O2 upregulates the production of 8‐iso‐prostaglandin F2α (8‐iso‐PGF2α), which signals
  through thromboxane receptor (TR) to activate Rho/ROCK and inositol trisphosphate
  (IP3) signaling cascades. Furthermore, O2 promotes constriction by cytochrome P450
  (CYP450)–mediated binding of endothelin‐1 (ET‐1) to endothelin receptor A (ETA),
  which subsequently activates the IP3pathway. Similarly, glutamate activates IP3signaling
  via noradrenaline (NA) production. Once activated, IP3 then binds to IP3 receptor
  (IP3R) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing movement of calcium into the cytoplasm.
  Intracellular calcium concentrations are also regulated by transient receptor potential
  melastatin‐3 channel (TRPM3), which becomes activated under hypo‐osmotic conditions.
  Accumulation of intracellular calcium facilitates activation of MLCK, which phosphorylates
  MLC, allowing for myosin and actin interaction and subsequent muscle contraction.
  [Ca2+]i indicates concentration of intracellular calcium; and [Ca2+]SR, concentration
  of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
