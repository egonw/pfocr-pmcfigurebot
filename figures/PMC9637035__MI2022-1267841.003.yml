caption: PQQ administration attenuates airway inflammation in an OVA-induced mouse
  model. (a) Protocols for establishment of the OVA-induced allergic asthma mouse
  model and administration of PQQ. (b) Representative photomicrographs of lung sections
  stained with H&E and examined at 100x magnification. (c) Lung pathological scores
  of peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in asthmatic model
  mice and PQQ-/DXM-treated asthmatic model mice. (d) Serum IgE levels in asthmatic
  model mice and PQQ-/DXM-treated asthmatic model mice. The columns and error bars
  represent the means and SEMs (n = 5 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. Similar results
  were obtained in at least three independent experiments.
