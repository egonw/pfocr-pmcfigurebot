caption: Dysfunctional telomeres increase mice vulnerability to respiratory viral
  infection through the cGAS/STING pathway. (a) WT and Terc −/− mice (n = 12) were
  intratracheally (i.t.) challenged with influenza virus A/PR8 strain (1 × 108 pfu/mouse).
  Animals were monitored every 10 h for survival rate. The Kaplan–Meier and log‐rank
  methods were used to analyze the data. (b–g) WT and Terc −/− mice (n = 5) were infected
  with influenza A/PR8 strain (1 × 104 pfu/mouse) or PBS (Uni) for 48 h, and then
  sacrificed for functional analysis. Counts of total cells in BALF (b); BALF levels
  of proinflammatory cytokines (c); Protein leakage in BALF (d); Representative H&E
  staining of lung tissues (e), sites of inflammatory infiltrate were marked; Quantification
  of viral titer and mRNA in lungs (f); BALF level of IFNβ (g). (h‐l) qPCR assay of
  p16, p21 and SASP‐related genes in lung tissues (h); Immunohistology staining of
  SA‐β‐Gal in lungs (i); Immunoblotting of STING and the related signaling molecules
  in lung tissues (j); BALF level of cGAMP (k); Confocal staining of DNA dye Draq5
  (cyan) and STING (red) (l). (m) WT and Terc −/− mice (n = 7) were pretreated with
  H151 (7 mg/kg) or DMSO for 3 days, followed by A/PR8 infection. Animals were monitored
  every 10 h for survival rate. (n, o) WT and Terc −/− mice (n = 3) were pretreated
  with H151 or DMSO for 3 days, followed by A/PR8 infection for 48 h. Counts of total
  cells and protein leakage (n) in BALF; Representative H&E staining of lung tissues
  (o). Shown are representative images, Bars, 100 μm. The data from one of three independent
  experiments are expressed as means ± SD
