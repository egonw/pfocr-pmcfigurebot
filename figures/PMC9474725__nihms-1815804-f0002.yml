caption: The Ripk2104Asp allele acts dominantly and is sufficient to confer increased
  susceptibility to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. (A-D) Knee joints of WT and Ripk2104Asp
  mice that underwent sham surgery are similar histologically, with no indication
  of an OA phenotype. (E, F) Following DMM surgery, WT knees displayed mild/moderate
  loss of proteoglycan content in the articular cartilage on the medial side of the
  knee (indicated by loss of toluidine blue staining). The extent of the damage is
  indicated by the arrows in F, G, H. Following DMM surgery, joints of Ripk2104Asp
  mice displayed moderate/severe loss of proteoglycan content (arrows in H), cartilage
  fibrillation, and complete loss of articular cartilage in the medial tibial plateau
  (asterisk in H). (I) Average whole joint and (J) maximal OARSI scores of sham-operated
  and DMM-operated knee joints. (K) There was no difference in the degree of synovitis
  between different genotypes. A, C, G, E are images of the entire knee joint; dashed
  boxes were magnified in B, D, F, H to focus on degradation on the medial side of
  the joint. Femur is up and medial is to the right in all images. WT sham (n=4),
  Ripk2104Asp sham (n=3), WT DMM (n=7), Ripk2104Asp DMM (n=9). All animals were analyzed
  8 weeks post-surgery. Error bars represent ±SD and statistically significant differences
  of P ≤ 0.01 (**), P ≤ 0.001 (***), and P ≤ 0.0001 (****) were determined by two-way
  ANOVA with Tukey‟s multiple comparisons test.
