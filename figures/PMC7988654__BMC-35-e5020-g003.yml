caption: 'Pathway analysis of the different metabolites: (a) Western Blot (WB) assay
  for key protein expression; (b) NO level detection; and (c) bubble plot for pathway
  analysis of the different metabolites. The x‐axis represents the pathway impact
  and the y‐axis describes the impact value. The circular area is proportional to
  the number of metabolites assigned to the term and the color accords with the P‐value;
  (d) the regulatory relationship of metabolic pathways in response to CFA‐induced
  inflammatory pain. Potential biomarkers are marked as red (up‐regulated), green
  (down‐regulated) and blue (without significant changes). Other undetected metabolites
  in the metabolic pathway are labeled in black. The names of related metabolic pathways
  are marked in red in the corresponding dashed box'
