caption: Upregulation of miR-181a-5p inhibited tumor growth and metastasis of ESCC.
  Nude mice were injected subcutaneously with ESCC cells and intratumorally injected
  with miR-181a-5p via. (A) The tumor volume in miR-181a-5p mimics and negative control
  mice; (B) the tumor weight in miR-181a-5p mimics and negative control mice; *P <
  0.05 miR-181a-5p mimics vs. the NC groups; (C) H&E staining in experimental mice;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 miR-181a-5p mimics vs. the NC groups.
