caption: 'Decreased expression of NMNAT3 protein in the caudate nucleus of Parkinson’s
  disease patient brain. (A) Representative western blot of four non-disease control
  and four Parkinson’s disease subjects. Caudate nucleus and cerebellum samples were
  lysed in RIPA buffer and NMNATs −1, −2, −3, SARM1 and β-tubulin loading control
  were subsequently detected with specific antibodies. Bands were visualized using
  electrochemiluminescence detection. (B) Quantification of NMNAT3 protein expression.
  NMNAT3 band intensities were quantified by densitometric analysis using FIJI ImageJ
  v.1.53a and were normalized for β-tubulin. Results were expressed as ratio ± SEM
  (n = 19 for non-disease controls, n = 19 for Parkinson’s disease subjects). Statistical
  analysis comprised Student’s t-test with Welch correction and was performed using
  Prism v8.3. Abbreviations: NDC, non-disease control subjects; PD, Parkinson’s disease
  subjects; NMNAT, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; SARM1, sterile
  alpha and TIR motif containing 1.'
article_title: Alpha-synucleinopathy reduces NMNAT3 protein levels and neurite formation
  that can be rescued by targeting the NAD+ pathway.
