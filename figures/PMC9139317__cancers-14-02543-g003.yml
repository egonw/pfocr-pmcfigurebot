caption: Association between KYNU and tumor immunophenotype. (A) Scatter plot illustrating
  Spearman correlations (95% CI) between continuous values of KYNU mRNA expression
  with gene-based signatures of cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T cells, and immune
  checkpoint blockaded related genes CD274 (PD-L1), PDCD1 (PD1), and CTLA4 in TCGA-LUAD
  tumors stratified by presence or absence of KEAP1 mutations. (B) Distribution of
  gene-based signatures reflective of cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T cells, and immune
  checkpoint blockade-related genes CD274 (PD-L1), PDCD1 (PD1), and CTLA4 in TCGA-LUAD
  tumors stratified by KYNU mRNA expression into the bottom and top 25th percentiles.
  Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. (C)
  Representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of KYNU protein expression in
  adenocarcinoma TMA stratified by KYNU protein expression (negative, positive (50–150)
  and strong positivity (>150)), as well as adjacent control tissue. Red arrows indicate
  tumor tissue while blue arrows indicate inflammatory cell staining. Insets show
  a 5× enlargement. (D) Association between KYNU protein expression (negative, positive
  (50–150) and strong positivity (>150)) and PD-L1 staining positivity and CD8+ TILs
  (E) in LUAD TMAs. PD-L1 was stratified based on whether PD-L1 was >median of the
  H-Score (high) or ≤median of H-scores (low). CD8+ levels were stratified into either
  high (>median of positive cells per millimeter (mm)2 tissue) or low (≤median of
  positive cells per mm2 tissue). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided
  χ2 test for trend.
