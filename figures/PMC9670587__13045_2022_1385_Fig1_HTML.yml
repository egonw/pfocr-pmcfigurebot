caption: IMM01 anti-tumor activity against blood tumors was tested in the Daudi xenograft
  model (A, B) and the Raji orthotopic model (C). The Daudi xenograft tumor model
  (A, B) revealed that the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value was 97.48% on the day
  of 24, after administration of IMM01 at 5 mg/kg. A Raji orthotopic model showed
  that IMM01 has better effects than rituximab, and the combination of IMM01 and rituximab
  (both at 5 mg/kg) has significantly better results than any single drug alone (C).
  IMM01 alone can prolong > 60% of the mice’s survival for 80 days, whereas the combination
  of IMM01 and rituximab can prolong 100% of the mice’s survival for 80 days
article_title: SIRPα-Fc fusion protein IMM01 exhibits dual anti-tumor activities by
  targeting CD47/SIRPα signal pathway via blocking the “don’t eat me” signal and activating
  the “eat me” signal.
