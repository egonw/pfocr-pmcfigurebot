caption: Propranolol affected the MAPK pathway and apoptosis signaling in vivo. (A)
  HE staining of control group and propranolol treatment group (hematoxylin-eosin,
  original magnification ×40). (B-F) Immunohistochemical detection of Ki-67, NHE1,
  P-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, caspase3 protein expression level in tumor tissue (original
  magnification ×40). (G-H) Western blot detection of, NHE1, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, cleaved-caspase3,
  Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression levels and statistics in tumor tissues. ns, no
  significance, *, P<0.05, **, P<0.01. Western blot was repeated three times. MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; NHE1, Na+/H+ exchanger.
