caption: PPAR signaling pathway is associated with the clinical prognosis of patients
  with lung adenocarcinoma. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of
  the intersected gene indicated that the most enriched pathway was the ‘PPAR signaling
  pathway’, with the pathway showing the highest number of related genes being the
  ‘neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’. (B) The genes related to the PPAR signaling
  pathway were further predicted through database search. It was found that the expression
  levels of the PPAR pathway-related genes (C) CYP27A1, (D) LPL, (E) ANGPTL4 and (F)
  UBC were significantly associated with the survival rate of patients with lung adenocarcinoma
  by using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database and adjusting
  the sample size. For the ANGPTL4 gene, the sample size was reduced to avoid overlapping
  lines. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; p.adjust, adjusted P-value;
  TPM, transcripts per million; HR, hazard ratio.
