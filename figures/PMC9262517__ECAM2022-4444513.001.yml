caption: 'PFWE reduced airway resistance and neutrophil infiltration in ARDS model
  mice. (a) The mice received LPS 10 μg/mouse by intratracheal (IT) injection and
  were treated with different doses of PFWE by intraperitoneal (IP) administration
  on days 0–2. The mice were divided into five groups: normal (N), LPS-stimulated
  (L), and three treatment groups (PFWE 2, 5, and 8 g/kg). (b) Airway resistance was
  determined with the stimulation of different doses of methacholine (0, 3, and 30 mg/ml)
  (n = 8−12 mice in each group). The (c) percentage and (d) cell number of neutrophils
  in BALF of mice in each group (n = 10 in each group). (e) The representative histograms
  of Gr-1+ cells are shown. (f) The percentages of Gr-1+ cells in CD45+ cells, (g)
  Gr-1+ cell number, and (h) total leukocytes in the lungs were examined by flow cytometry
  (n = 8 in each group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001) compared with the LPS-stimulated group and analyzed using one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Kruskal–Wallis test.'
