caption: 'Effects of chrysin on apoptosis and the correlation between SPHK-1 and chrysin-induced
  apoptosis under hypoxia. (A) Effect of chrysin on the cytotoxicity of PC-3 cells
  for 24 h under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Results are presented as the means
  ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
  versus control groups. (B) Cells were used for FACS analysis to analyze their cell
  cycle. FACS image of cell cycle distribution diagram and bar graph. The bar graph
  expresses the percentage of sub-G1 population. Data represent mean ± SD values,
  ** p < 0.01 compared to normoxia control and ## p < 0.01 compared to hypoxia control
  and $$ p < 0.01 compared to normoxia chrysin-treated group. (C) Representative Western
  blot images and relative densitometric bar graphs of HIF-1α, VEGF, Bcl-2, c-cas-3,
  and c-PARP. Cells were treated with chrysin (50 μM) for 24 h under normoxia and
  hypoxia. The lysates were subjected to Western blotting for HIF-1α, VEGF, Bcl-2,
  c-cas-3, c-PARP, and β-actin. Bar graphs represent the quantification of interest
  protein related to β-actin and presented as a fold change of control; * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 when compared to hypoxia control, while # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01
  (compared to normoxia control). After the treatment of PC-3 cells with chrysin,
  (D) stained with CellEventTM (caspase-3/7) live dye. (E) Representative Western
  blot images and relative densitometric bar graphs of SPHK-1, HIF-1α, Bcl-2, c-cas-3,
  and PARP. PC-3 PCa cells were transfected with control or HIF-1α siRNA for 48 h
  and were incubated in the presence or absence of 50 μM chrysin for 24 h. Cell lysates
  were prepared and subjected to Western blotting to analyze the expression of SPHK-1,
  HIF-1α, Bcl-2, c-cas-3, PARP, and β-actin. Bar graphs represent the quantification
  of interest protein related to β-actin, presented as a fold change of control. a~f
  means in a row by different superscripts are significantly different by LSD (least
  significant difference) at p < 0.05. (F) Western blotting analysis on SPHK-1 siRNA-transfected
  and chrysin-treated samples. Bar graphs represent the quantification of interest
  protein related to β-actin and are presented as a fold change of control. a~f means
  in a row by different superscripts are significantly different by LSD (least significant
  difference) at p < 0.05.'
