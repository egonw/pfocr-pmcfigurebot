figure_title: SETD2 mutation and expression status in primary ccRCCs and the potential
  correlation between SETD2 alterations and expression of ERV and RIG-I immune response
  pathway genes
caption: (A–F) Differential SETD2 expression levels between various normal-adjacent
  and matched tumor tissues (A), stratified by tumor staging (stages I–IV) (B), overall
  survival (C), ERV expression status (D and E), and expression status of RIG-I pathway
  genes (F) by comparing TCGA kidney cancers with high SETD2 expression (high) versus
  SETD2 mutant plus low SETD2 expression (L + M). The Mann-Whitney unpaired statistical
  test was used to assess gene and ERV expression differences between tumor and normal
  tissues.
