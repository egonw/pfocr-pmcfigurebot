caption: ABA-dependent and -independent pathway in rice under normal and salinity
  stress conditions. ABA-dependent pathway includes regulatory components (PYR/PYL/RCAR),
  PP2C, subclass III SnRK2, and four ARBB/ABF transcription factors such as AREB1,
  AREB2, ARF3, and ARF1 gene expression. ABA-independent pathway includes transcription
  factors (DREB2A) and stress-related genes. CEâ€”coupling element.
