figure_title: Reactive astrocytes restrict the activation of spinal cord NSCs by suppressing
  UCHL1-depentdent protein aggregate clearance via the C3/C3aR signaling after SCI
caption: UCHL1 facilitates NSC activation by clearing the protein aggregates through
  ubiquitin-proteasome approach. Reactive astrocytes activated by SCI cause the downregulation
  of UCHL1, resulting in the accumulation of protein aggregations and suppression
  of NSC activation post-ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunctions in NSCs by C3/C3aR
  pathway.
