caption: (A) Metabolic pathway for oxidation products from acetyl RCF oil oligomers
  in P. putida strain CJ781. Base treatment of the oxidation products hydrolyzed acetyl
  groups from aromatic monomers, yielding a mixture of syringaldehyde, syringate,
  vanillin, and vanillate. Syringaldehyde and syringate are converted to biomass (growth)
  via 3-O-methylgallate, gallate, and 4-oxalomesaconate. Vanillin and vanillate are
  converted to muconate via protocatechuate and catechol. (B) Strain CJ781 cultivated
  in M9 minimal medium with 1 mM/each of the model compounds syringaldehyde, syringate,
  vanillin, vanillate. (C) Strain CJ781 cultivated in M9 minimal medium with 10% v/v
  oxidation products from acetyl RCF oil. Gallate and catechol were not detected at
  significant concentrations in any of the experiments, and 4-oxalomesaconate was
  not measured. All cultures contained 5 mM glucose at time zero, and glucose was
  fed to a concentration of 5 mM every 24 h to support growth. Error bars represent
  the standard deviation from the mean of three biological replicates. Numerical data
  are provided in Table S15, and additional reaction replicates for the experiment
  in (C) are shown in Figure S12.
