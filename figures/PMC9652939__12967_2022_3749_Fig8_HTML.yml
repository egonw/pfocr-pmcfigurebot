caption: MICAL1 expression was positively correlated with p-TBC1D1 Ser660, FZD7 and
  β-catenin. A Representative immunohistochemical staining of MICAL1, p-TBC1D1Ser660,
  FZD7 and β-catenin in sections of pancreatic cancer specimens. B Immunohistochemical
  analysis of MICAL1, p-TBC1D1.Ser660, FZD7 and β-catenin expression in specimens
  from 92 cases of pancreatic cancer. Statistical differences were determined by Chi-squared
  Test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01
article_title: MICAL1 facilitates pancreatic cancer proliferation, migration, and
  invasion by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway.
