caption: Target identification by probes BP-2, BP-3 and BP-4. (A) Silver staining
  of probes BP-2, BP-3 and BP-4 (0.2 μmol/L) with or without competitor CuB (100 ×).
  Probe labelled proteins were labeled with biotin and enriched by streptavidin column,
  separated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (n = 3). (B) Validation of the potential
  target GRP78 by pull-down/WB with probes BP-2, BP-3 and BP-4 (0.2 μmol/L) with or
  without competitor CuB (100 ×). All data are representative of at least three independent
  experiments.
