caption: 'DDAH1 KO aggravated blast explosion-induced changing in DDAH1/ADMA/eNOS
  signaling pathway. (a) Western blot of DDAH1/ADMA/eNOS signaling pathway in each
  group. (b) Relative density of DDAH1. (c) Relative density of eNOS. (d) ADMA levels
  in the lung tissue. (e) NO contents in serum. (f) Immunofluorescence of eNOS. (g)
  Positive cell rate of N-cadherin in immunofluorescence. Data are mean ± SD. ∗P <
  0.05, compared with the same kind of mice in the control group, #P < 0.05, compared
  with WT mice in the same group.'
