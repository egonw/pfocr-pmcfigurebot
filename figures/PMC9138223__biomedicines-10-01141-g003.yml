caption: Rab-mediated amyloid precursor protein metabolism. De novo amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) is produced with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to
  Golgi for protein maturation via a Rab1 trafficking pathway. Upon passage through
  the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN), APP resides with the plasma membranes.
  APP may be processed via the non-amyloidogenic route via α-secretase producing soluble
  APPα which is released into the extracellular environment. Alternatively, APP along
  with β-secretases may be internalised via Rab5-dependent endocytosis. Once in the
  acidic internal compartments of early and late endosomes (EE/LE) the cleavage of
  APP via β-secretases generates the β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF). β-secretases is
  in turn recycled to the plasma membrane either directly via Rab4-mediated traffic,
  via recycling endosomes (RE) dependent on Rab11 trafficking or trafficking alongside
  the β-CTF to the Golgi. Within the Golgi and TGN, the γ-secretase complex facilitated
  by its association with Rab6 processes the β-CTF into β-amyloid (Aβ) which is trafficking
  into secretary vesicles via Rab10 and released via Rab27/Rab3-dependent process,
  alongside post Golgi trafficking APP and β-secretase. Also shown is the faciliatory
  role of Ras and Rab interactor 3 (RIN3) and adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting
  with PH domain and leucine zipper 1 (APPL1) on Rab5-mediated endocytosis as well
  as the association of GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIα/β) with the γ-secretase
  component presenilin-1. The alternative processing of β-CTF into Aβ within the lysosomes
  is not shown in this schematic. Rabs more strongly associated with secretory pathways
  are shaded in blue while those more strongly associated with endosomal pathways
  are shown in red.
