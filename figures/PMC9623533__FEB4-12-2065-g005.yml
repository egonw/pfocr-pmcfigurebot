caption: 'PERK pathway‐induced ER stress response mechanism depends on stress level.
  HEK293T cells were treated with low (0.1 μm thapsigargin for 2 h) and high (10 μm
  thapsigargin for 2 h) levels of ER stress and then the cells were denoted in time.
  (A) The markers of PERK pathway (i.e. eIF2α‐P, ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34) and the key
  markers of both autophagy (LC3) and apoptosis (PARP) were followed by immunoblotting.
  GAPDH was used as the loading control. The full‐length blots are included in the
  . (B) Densitometry data represents the intensity of cleaved LC3 II, PARP, ATF4,
  CHOP, and GADD34 normalized for GAPDH, while eIF2α‐P normalized for total level
  of eIF2α. Control samples were not treated with any reagent (including DMSO). For
  each of the experiments, three complete biological repeat experiments were carried
  out. Error bars represent standard deviation. In the calculation of statistical
  significance, all data were compared to the untreated controls. Results are presented
  as mean values ± SD and were compared using ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple comparison
  post hoc test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from the
  appropriate control: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. TG, thapsigargin.'
