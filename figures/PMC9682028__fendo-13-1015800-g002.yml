caption: 'Functional analysis of mRNAs in competitive regulatory networks. (A) Gene
  enrichment function in lncRNA-mRNA network of in control group (without 50 U/ml
  IL-1β and 1000 U/ml IFN-γ stimulation). (B) Gene enrichment function in lncRNA-mRNA
  network in cytokines group (with 50 U/ml IL-1β and 1000 U/ml IFN-γ stimulation).
  (C) Functional comparison of mRNA enrichment in ceRNA network under exosomes of
  different states. ctrl: Function enriched for mRNAs in network without cytokines
  stimulation; cyto: Function enriched for mRNAs in network with cytokines stimulation.
  (D) The pathway crosstalk network. In the crosstalk network, two pathways are connected
  by an edge if they shared at least one gene. The thickness of the edge is proportional
  to the number of shared genes between the two connected pathways. Edges colored
  with red represent the number of shared genes> 20 between the connected two pathways.
  Pathways with blue, purple and yellow color are specific for different treatment,
  respectively.'
