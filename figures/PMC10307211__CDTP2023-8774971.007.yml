caption: 'The key regulated pathway detection in immunotherapy-related myocarditis.
  (a, b) The map of glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids and glycerolipid metabolism
  was significantly detected. (c) The DGKZ-related cellular compartment-specific protein-protein
  interaction (ComPPI) was identified via the ComPPI database (URL: http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu).
  (d) The mitochondrion-related subnetwork. (e) DGKZ-related molecular function enrichment
  results involved in Reactome database (https://reactome.org). (f) The targeted drug
  molecule prediction in response to Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; https://ctdbase.org).'
