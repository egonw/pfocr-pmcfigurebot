caption: mir-31-5p may target AMPK/Sirt1/NLRP3 axis to mediate DSS-induced colonic
  mucosal inflammation in mice. (A) Immunohistochemical analysis of P-AMPK, Sirt1
  and NLRP3 in colon of mice. Yellow brown were positive signals (the ruler was 10
  um, and the positive signals were marked by red arrows). (B) The relative mRNA levels
  of AMPK, Sirt1, NLRP3 and caspase-1 in colon tissues of mice were detected by qPCR.
  (C) Western blot analysis of P-AMPK/AMPK, NLRP3, Sirt1 and caspase-1. (D) Quantitative
  protein analysis of P-AMPK/AMPK, Sirt1, NLRP3 and caspase-1. Each bar represents
  mean ± SD, n ≥ 5 from each group. Ns represented P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. DSS group.
