caption: Single-cell transcriptomics of organoids. A Single-cell transcriptomics consists
  of isolation of single cells, followed by lysis, RNA conversion to cDNA by reverse
  transcription and barcoding. Barcoded cDNA is then used for preparation of cDNA
  library which can be sequenced and subsequently analysed. B Dimension reduction
  allows clustering of single cells based on transcriptome profile. Identification
  of highly expressed marker genes enables cell type annotation. Additional analyses
  can assess RNA kinetics (pseudotime analysis), cell cycle state, gene expression
  and pathway enrichment. C Recently, single-cell atlases of human organoid models
  corresponding different tissues have been established
