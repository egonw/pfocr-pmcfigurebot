caption: (a) N. brasiliensis iL3s (n = 100) were co-cultured in the presence of RBCs
  with 100 µM known anthelmintics (pyrantel, piperazine, imidazole, albendazole, chloroquine,
  benzimidazole, metronidazole and quinidine). After 3 days, Sytox Green was added
  to the wells and 24 h later, fluorescence (arbitrary units, a.u.) was measured by
  spectrophotometry. The average of duplicate values for each drug are shown as a
  heat-map ranging from medium viability (MED) to low viability (DEAD i.e., equivalent
  to killed by boiling) (arbitrary units a.u.). (b) Drug dilution series for pyrantel,
  albendazole (Alb.), quinidine (QND), and quinine (QN) using the same assay as described
  in (a). Data were normalised to those for “dead” controls and pooled from three
  independent experiments and represented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
  The compound concentrations were log10-transformed and fitted using a variable slope
  four-parameter equation, using ordinary least squares fit model. (c) Using the same
  conditions as described in (b), motility was assessed by microscopy 4 days after
  culture. Motility scores were calculated for individual compounds, normalised with
  reference to the negative control (100% motility) and recorded as percentages. Data
  points represent one experiment conducted in triplicate; mean ± standard error of
  the mean (SEM).
