caption: GPRC5B mediated cartilage homeostasis by PI3K–AKT signaling. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the wild-type and Gprc5b−/− chondrocytes
  stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 24 h in RNA-sequence analysis. (B) Heat map
  analysis related genes of PI3K–AKT pathway in wild-type and Gprc5b−/− chondrocytes
  stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. (C) The GSEA analysis showed that PI3k–Akt
  pathway is upregulation in Gprc5b−/− chondrocytes. (D) The PPI analysis of mTOR
  pathway from RNA-seq of wild-type and Gprc5b−/− chondrocytes. Blue is the mTOR pathway
  protein and their interaction protein has been summarized in the other eight pathways
  displayed by different colors. The underlined proteins are associated with autophagy
  signaling.
