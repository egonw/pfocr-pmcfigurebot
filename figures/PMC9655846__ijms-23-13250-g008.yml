caption: 'Enriched oncogenic and immune-associated signatures associated with dysregulated
  microbes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify unique oncogenic
  and immune-associated pathways associated with dysregulated microbes (p < 0.05 and
  false discovery rates (FDRs) < 0.25). GSEA signatures were classified into the following
  categories for analysis purposes: antitumor, Cell Cycle/Growth, DNA damage, Inflammation,
  Metabolism, Metastasis, Oncogenic, Protumor, and Tumor-Suppressive. Orange corresponds
  to fungal microbes, while blue corresponds to bacterial microbes. (A) Bar plots
  visualizing pathway enrichment for dysregulated microbes in HNSCC tumor samples
  and adjacent normal samples. Dysregulated fungi were found to disproportionately
  account for enriched pathways when compared to bacteria across both tumor and normal
  samples. (B) Bar plots visualizing pathway enrichment for dysregulated microbes
  in the HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC samples. Only one bacterial microbe was significantly
  correlated with pathways for the HPV- HNSCC cohort, while 45 bacteria were correlated
  with enriched signatures pertaining to metabolism and carcinogenesis in the HPV+
  HNSCC cohort. (C) Bar plots visualizing pathway enrichment for dysregulated microbes
  in HPV- HNSCC smokers and HPV- HNSCC nonsmokers. Among the HPV- smoking and nonsmoking
  HNSCC samples, we observed that dysregulated microbes were primarily associated
  with the upregulation of signatures relating to cell cycle growth, metastasis, and
  carcinogenesis. (D) Bar plots visualizing pathway enrichment for dysregulated microbes
  in HNSCC heavy drinkers and HNSCC nondrinkers. In HNSCC heavy drinkers, all significantly
  enriched pathways were enriched by fungal species, while bacterial species contributed
  to enriched pathways in nondrinkers.'
