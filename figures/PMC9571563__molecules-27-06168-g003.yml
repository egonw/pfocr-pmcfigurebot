caption: The effects of ellagic acid on the DAF-16 distribution and oxidative indices
  in the worms exposed to UV radiation. DAF-16 localization in the nucleus of the
  TJ356 control nematodes (A) and the ellagic acid treatment group (B) was measured
  using a fluorescence microscope under 10× objective, n > 15. (C) The amount of DAF-16
  in the nucleus was calculated using ImageJ software. Each column was represented
  with the mean ± SD. The SOD-3 expression in the CF1553 worms of the control group
  (D) and the ellagic acid treatment group (E) was observed with a fluorescent microscope
  under a 10× objective, n > 15. (F) ImageJ was used to determine the fluorescence
  intensity of SOD-3 expression in the nematodes. Each column shows the mean ± SD.
  (G) The measurement of the ROS level was achieved by DCFH-DA fluorescence staining,
  n > 120. (H) The SOD activity was determined using a SOD assay kit, n > 500. Each
  column is represented by the mean ± SD. p < 0.5 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001
  (***).
