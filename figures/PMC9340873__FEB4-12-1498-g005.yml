caption: 'Ulinastatin upregulated Mer expression by activating ERK5. (A) ERK5 and
  p‐ERK5 protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Upper part: Representative
  blot of protein expression; lower part: Relative protein expression of ERK5 and
  p‐ERK5. (B) ERK5 and p‐ERK5 protein levels were determined by Western blotting after
  treatment with inhibitor BIX02189. Upper part: Representative blot of protein expression;
  lower part: Relative protein expression of ERK5 and p‐ERK5. (C) ERK5 protein levels
  were determined by Western blotting after treatment with the inhibitor XMD8‐92.
  Left: Representative blot of protein expression; right: Relative protein expression
  of ERK5 and p‐ERK5. (D) Immunofluorescence assay for the determination of membrane
  protein Mer after treatment with the inhibitor BIX02189. (E) Relative protein expression
  of membrane protein Mer. (F) The level of membrane protein Mer was determined by
  immunofluorescence assay after treatment with the inhibitor XMD8‐92. (G) Relative
  protein expression of membrane protein Mer. Data is expressed as mean ± standard
  deviation, one‐way ANOVA, n = 3, *P < 0.05 vs. 0 U·mL−1 UTI group. [Colour figure
