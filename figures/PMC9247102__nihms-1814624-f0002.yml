caption: Discovery of a candidate gnt biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) via sequencing
  a guanitoxin-producing cyanobacterium. (A) Annotation of the assembled 5.24 Mbp
  Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024 genome using antiSMASH v6.0 detected
  11 candidate BGCs, while a single candidate guanitoxin BGC was identified via colocalization
  of relevant candidate enzyme activities. The figure was produced with Circos v0.69-8.
  The background S. torques-reginae image is used with permission from Dr. Vera Werner.
  (B) Organization of the guanitoxin BGC. The gnt locus figure was designed from NCBI
  accession CP080598.1 (this work) using Clinker v0.0.21.gnt BGC deposited under MIBiG
  accession number BGC0002148. (C) Guanitoxin biosynthetic pathway in S. torques-reginae
  ITEP-024. Individual Gnt enzymes are color-coded after their encoding gnt gene as
  per (B).
