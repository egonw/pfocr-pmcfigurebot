caption: ANP32A knockdown affects the expression of proteins associated with EMT via
  the ERK and Akt pathway in CRC cells. (A) Representative western blotting image
  of EMT-, ERK- and Akt-associated proteins expressed in ANP32A knockdown HCT116 cells.
  (B) Representative western blotting image of EMT- and ERK-associated proteins expressed
  in ANP32A knockdown SW480 cells. (C-F) Quantification of the western blotting bands
  in ANP32A knockdown CRC cells. All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
  and n=3. *P<0.5, **P<0.01 vs. sh-NC. ANP32A, acidic leucine rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; CRC, colorectal cancer; sh, short hairpin
  RNA; NC, negative control.
