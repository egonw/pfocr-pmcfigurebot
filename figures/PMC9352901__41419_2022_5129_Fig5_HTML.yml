caption: A The tumor xenografts were photographed on the 31st day of the experiment.
  IgG and neutralization antibody (Ab) were injected intraperitoneally on the second
  day of every three days. B Tumor volumes were recorded every three days. C Tumor
  weights were measured at the end of the experiment. D Intraperitoneal metastasis
  models were conducted. The peritoneal metastatic images were photographed at the
  end of the experiment, and the representative images of each group were displayed
  (black dotted circle). E Metastatic tumor weights were recorded. F The number of
  metastatic foci were calculated. G Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of α-SMA,
  CRMP2 and HIF-1α in mice tumors of each group. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not
  significant.
