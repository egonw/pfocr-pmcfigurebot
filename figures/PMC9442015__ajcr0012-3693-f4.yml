caption: Ku80 knockdown and inhibition of LSD1 repress invasiveness and proliferation
  and induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells in vitro. A. Western blot detected the
  shRNA transfection efficiency. B. Statistically significant differences among Different
  interference sequences. C. Effect of different concentrations of RN-1 on colon cancer
  HCT116 cell growth. D. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, the proliferation activity of HCT116
  cells in the experimental group (shKu80#2, RN-1 group, shKu80#2 + RN-1 group) was
  significantly inhibited compared with the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h,
  there was no significant difference in the proliferation activity of HCT116 cells
  in the shKu80#2 and RN-1 groups, but the shKu80#2 + RN-1 group had significant differences
  compared with the shKu80#2 and RN-1 groups, respectively. E, F. Edu assay also obtained
  similar results. G-N. Effect of HCT116 cells that transfected shRNA#2 or/and RN-1-treated
  was observed on the invasion, migration, apoptosis, and clone formation. O-Q. The
  expression of LSD1, Ku80, and FOXF2 in HCT116 cells that transfected shRNA#2 or/and
  RN-1-treated were detected by Western blot. Values represent the mean ± standard
  deviation of 3 independent experiments. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
