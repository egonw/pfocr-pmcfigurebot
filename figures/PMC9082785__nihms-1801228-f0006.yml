figure_title: Combined IL-1 and TNF blockade maintains cellular quorum and alveolar
  niche signaling during LPS-mediated inflammatory injury
caption: A) Experimental design, as in . B-E) UMAP of epithelial (B) and endothelial
  (C) cell clusters from control (n=2, B, D, as in ), LPS-treated (n=2, B’, D’, as
  in ) and combination blockade (n=3, B”, D”) animals. C, E) Relative proportions
  of each cell type. F) CellChat analysis of the alveolar signaling milieu after blockade
  compared to LPS – enriched signals in LPS (red text); enriched signals in combined
  blockade (green text). Lung stromal signaling milieu reverts markedly compared to
  LPS treatment. FGF, HFG, pleiotrophin, and endothelin signaling improve with blockade.
  G) Comparison of intensity of major signaling pathways in control, LPS, and blockade
  conditions demonstrates normalization of some pathways (* = not significantly different
  than control, p>0.05 for control vs blockade) while others improve but do not normalize
  (Δ = significantly improved from LPS, but significantly elevated compared to control,
  p<0.05 for comparison to LPS and comparison to control), including most inflammatory
  pathways. H-I) GO term and pathway analysis of differentially regulated genes by
  cellHarmony, delineating the global effect of combination blockade. Genes and pathways
  are highlighted which revert (H) or do not revert (I) to near baseline expression
  with blockade. J) CellChat evaluation of AT1-AC interactions with LPS and following
  blockade.
