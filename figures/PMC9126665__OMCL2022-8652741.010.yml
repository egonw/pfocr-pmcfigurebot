caption: Scheme summarizing the proposed mechanisms for the antioxidant, antineuroinflammatory,
  and neuroprotective effects of NBP in RCIR-stimulated VD mice. Mechanisms involve
  the promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression, reduction of PICs, inhibition of
  TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and microglial proliferation, and the key role of NBP-mediated
  Nrf2 activation in the process.
