caption: STAT3 T622 phosphorylation promotes prostate cancer growth and predicts patient
  outcome. A, B, Endogenous STAT3‐depleted DU145 cells with stable expression of WT
  Flag‐STAT3 or indicated mutant were subcutaneously injected in mice. The images
  of two representative xenografts from each group are shown (A). The volume of mice
  tumor xenografts (n = 7) was measured at indicated time points after injection (B).
  Data represent the mean and SD. ***p < 0.001. C, The specificity of the anti‐STAT3
  pT622 antibody was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using phosphorylated
  or nonphosphorylated blocking peptide. Scale bar, 80 μm. D, E, IHC staining using
  indicated antibodies was performed using mouse tumor samples (D, scale bar, 80 μm)
  or human prostate cancer samples (E, scale bar, 50 μm). F, The IHC staining scores
  were analyzed by linear regression. G, Kaplan‐Meier plots of the overall survival
  time of prostate cancer patients (n = 55) with high or low STAT3 T622 phosphorylation
  or MST2 expression were generated. P value was calculated using the log‐rank test
