caption: Effects of DEP and ginseng extracts on the viability of human NCl–H292 cells.
  (A) The viability of human airway epithelial NCl–H292 cells treated with 100 μg/ml
  and 200 μg/ml DEP significantly decreased, whereas cells treated with DEP up to
  50 μg/ml remained viable. (B, C) KRG (up to 2 mg/ml) and saponin (up to 200 μg/ml)
  did not affect the cell survival. (D, E) Exposure to DEP (20 μg/ml) in combination
  with KRG up to 2 mg/ml or saponin up to 200 μg/ml, respectively, did not affect
  the cell viability. Bars indicate means  standard deviation (SD) of three independent
  experiments conducted in triplicate. ∗p < 0.05 versus the zero value. DEP, diesel
  exhaust particles; KRG, Korean Red Ginseng.

  and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation via TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in airway epithelium and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice.
