caption: Mechanistic pathway by which GTCs prevent PCa progression. In vitro studies
  [,,,] demonstrate that GTCs block proteasomal activity in PCa cells, leading to
  build-up of proteasomal substrates Kip1 and Ik-b α that subsequently downregulate
  the activity of NF-κB. This inhibits the cell cycle and elicits apoptosis in these
  PCa cells. GTCs, green tea catechins; Ik-b α, NF-κB inhibitor alpha; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; PCa, prostate cancer. Created with Biorender.com (accessed on 1
