caption: Those 57 metabolites enrich metabolic pathways with differential changes
  within the urine. The metabolic pathways were arranged by topology/enrichment analysis
  (x-/y-axes, separately), where x- and y-axes displayed pathway impact scores and
  p values separately. Circles have been colored according to specific p values, while
  circle size indicates the impact of the pathway.
