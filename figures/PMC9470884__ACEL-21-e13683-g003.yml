caption: Vasorelaxation (% of preconstriction) in aortic rings of WT and Ercc1 Δ/−  mice
  treated either with vehicle or BAY 54–6544 in response to ACh (10−9 to 10−5 Mol/L)
  (a). The contribution of NO‐cGMP and EDH pathway in WT vehicle (b), WT BAY 54–6544
  (c), Ercc1 Δ/−  vehicle (d), and Ercc1 Δ/−  BAY 54–6544 (e) treated mice. Vasorelaxation
  (% of preconstriction) in aortic rings of WT and Ercc1 Δ/−  mice treated either
  with vehicle or BAY 54–6544 in response to SNP (10−11 to 10−4 Mol/L) (f) and sGC
  activator BAY 60–2770 (10−10 to 10−5 Mol/L) (g). Vasorelaxation (% of preconstriction)
  in aortic rings of vehicle‐treated WT and Ercc1 Δ/−  mice in response to sGC stimulator
  BAY 41–8543 (10−10 to 10−5 Mol/L) (h). Data are presented in mean ± SEM. Statistical
  differences were analyzed by general linear model repeated measures for A‐H (* = p < 0.05)
