caption: 'NET1 expression is increased in the cardiac fibrosis model(A) Western blot
  was used to detect the changes of FN-1, α-SMA, and NET1 proteins, which were related
  to fibrosis in myocardial infarction tissue, and GAPDH was used as an internal reference.
  n = 5, ∗∗p = 0.0079, ∗p = 0.0476, ∗p = 0.0159 MI vs. Sham by Mann Whitney test.(B)
  qRT-PCR was used to detect the changes of NET1 mRNA in cardiac fibrosis. n = 4,
  ∗p = 0.0159 MI vs. Sham by Mann Whitney test.(C) Western blot was used to detect
  the changes of FN-1, α-SMA, and NET1 proteins in TGF-β1-treated group. n = 4, ∗p
  = 0.0286 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl by Mann Whitney test.(D) Representative image of cardiac
  fibroblasts stained with α-SMA antibody (Red) and NET1 antibody (Green). The levels
  of NET1 and α-SMA were measured by quantitative immunofluorescence. Scale bar: 50 μm,
  magnification 200×. n = 5, ∗p = 0.0159 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl (Left panel), ∗p = 0.0159
  TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl (Right panel) by Mann Whitney test. For all statistical plots, the
  data are presented as mean ± SEM.'
