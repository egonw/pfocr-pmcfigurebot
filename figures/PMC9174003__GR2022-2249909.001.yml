caption: 'Screening of mitochondria-related genes and establishment of a risk score
  model. (a) Differential (increased or reduced) mitochondria-related gene expression
  in the hazard group compared with that in the normal group. (b) Error rates of randomly
  generated trees (upper panel). Variable relative importance of the four selected
  mitochondria-related genes. (c) LASSO analysis: partial likelihood deviance values
  were plotted against log (Î») (upper panel). The relative abundance of the selected
  genes varies with the risk score.'
