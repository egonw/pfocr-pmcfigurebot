caption: Immune gene changes between pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor tissues.
  (A) Heat map for 68 DE genes (p < 0.05) showing overall upregulation. (B) Venn diagram
  demonstrating that 26 genes are DE from beginning to end of chemotherapy treatment
  in both tumor tissue and IP fluid. (C) These include genes involved in Th2 immune
  response and the complement pathway which are significantly upregulated in both
  IP fluid and tumor tissue (p < 0.05). (D) IHC shows an overall decrease in tumor
  infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes after chemotherapy in line with decrease in Th1 immune
  genes in IP fluid. (E) IHC staining for CD20 and CD3 in tumor tissue in two patients
  (Pt 3 and 4) showing tumor infiltrating B and T lymphocytes with diffuse distribution
  (left panels) or as lymphoid aggregates (right panels).
