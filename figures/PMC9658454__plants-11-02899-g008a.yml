caption: The sub-transcriptional regulatory network in different types of perturbation.
  (A,B) Transcriptional regulatory networks for the target genes of OsMADS58 in WT-dSpm
  (A) and WT-CRISPR (B) comparisons. Only the genes either differentially expressed
  in at least one comparison or directly targeted by OsMADS58 are shown. The node
  sizes indicate the number of neighborhoods for corresponding genes. OsMADS58, OsMADS58
  target genes, and oxidation reduction-related genes are highlighted by green, black,
  and orange circles, respectively. Gene IDs of transcription factors and oxidation
  reduction-related genes are shown with big and small text size, respectively. Nodes
  are colored according to high (red) or low expression (blue) related to wild-type
  (WT) samples. Grey nodes indicate non-differentially expressed genes. Edges denote
  regulation supported by ChIP-seq data (solid) or predicted by motif scanning (dashed).
  Only the edges with an absolute of correlation greater than 0.25 are shown. Edges
  are colored according to positive (blue) or negative (red) correlation between gene
  pairs. (C–L) Transcriptional regulatory networks for each pathway in WT-dSpm (left)
  and WT-CRISPR (right) comparisons. (C,D) Chloroplast development genes; (E,F) oxidation
  reduction genes; (G,H) cell cycle genes; (I,J) meiosis genes; (K,L) tapetum differentiation
  genes. Only the upstream and downstream genes of the pathway-related genes differentially
  expressed in at least one comparison are shown. High quality original files (A–L)
  can be found in the .
