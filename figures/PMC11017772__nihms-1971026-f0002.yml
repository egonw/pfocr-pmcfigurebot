figure_title: Resolution of TB disease state as a function of microbiome perturbation
  and pathogen killing
caption: Mixed-effects Random Forest Regression Modeling was run to predict the normalized
  enrichment score (NES) of A. MSigDB hallmark pathways or B. TB-associated gene signatures.
  Permutated importance analysis was used to identify features (both microbiome species
  and TTP) significantly associated (FDR < 0.1) with each modeled peripheral transcriptional
  signature. We then used univariate linear mixed-effects models to determine directionality
  of the associations; blue indicates a negative relationship, and red a positive
  one. The black dot indicates the strongest predictor for that specific hallmark
  pathway or TB-associated gene signature.
