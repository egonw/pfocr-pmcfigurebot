caption: General molecular mechanisms of biomolecular condensates. A) Sequestration
  of pathways away from ligands or interacting partners. Biomolecular condensates
  “hold” proteins or nucleic acids away from their targets or interacting partners
  not in the condensate. An example of this mechanism is mediated by the processing
  body and its components (green proteins) that help sequester translationally repressed
  mRNAs (red line in condensate). During skotomorphogenesis, this phenomenon may be
  required for the protein DCP5. When these nontranslating mRNAs in processing bodies
  are released, these mRNAs may undergo translation. B) Increasing dwell time of reaction
  components. Biomolecular condensates increase the local concentration of proteins
  (blue RNA-binding proteins) or nucleic acids (red nucleic acid) at a site to enhance
  a reaction or signaling pathway. An example of this regulation is mediated by FCA
  condensates that compartmentalize 3′ processing factors and help resolve the R-loop
  formed by the FLC antisense transcript (COOLAIR) at the FLC locus. C) Condensation
  mediated changes to cellular biophysical properties. Biomolecular condensate formation
  or dissolution can change biophysical properties of the cytoplasm, including changes
  to viscosity and protein diffusion. No published examples of this mechanism are
  available in plants at this time. The figure shows biomolecular condensate formation
  resulting in cytoplasmic liquification, based on the current hypothesis for FLOE1
  function. The opposite is observed with Tardigrade CAHS, where CAHS condensate formation
  results in cytoplasmic gelation.
