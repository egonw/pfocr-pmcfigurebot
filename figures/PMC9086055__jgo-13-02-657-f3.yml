caption: Enrichment plots from GSEA. Several pathways and biological processes were
  differentially enriched in CCDC68-related colorectal cancer, including the chemokine
  signaling pathway (A), the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (B), FcεRI-mediated NF-κB
  activation (C), CAMs (D), complement cascade (E), FcεRI-mediated MAPK activation
  (F), intestinal immune network for IgA production (G), the Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway (H), and Wnt signaling (I). GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; CCDC68,
  coiled-coil domain containing 68; NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery
  rate; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription;
  FcεRI, high-affinity IgE receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; CAMs, cell adhesion
  molecules; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IgA, immunoglobulin A.
