caption: Exposure to overnight shipping conditions induces a transcriptional response
  in PBMCs. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood from 3 healthy controls at 0 or 24 h.
  RNAseq was used to characterize transcriptional changes. K-means clustering revealed
  4 clusters in the 2000 most variable genes. Of these, only cluster D exhibited a
  uniform pattern of change at 24 h relative to 0 h in all 3 subjects, consistent
  with a transcriptional response associated with the handling conditions rather than
  inter-individual differences. Pathway analysis of the 695 genes in this cluster
  identified processes associated with signal transduction and inflammation. Transcriptional
  changes are heatmapped from blue (strongly downregulated) to red (highly upregulated).

  after overnight shipping of whole blood.
