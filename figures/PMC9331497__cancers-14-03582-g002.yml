caption: 'Phagocytosis regulators regulate the involvement of macrophages in tumor
  development. (A–L) Phagocytosis regulators regulate macrophage phagocytosis. (A–F)
  Pearson correlation of phagocytosis regulators with macrophage enrichment scores
  (Top6). We obtained 260 phagocytosis regulators with expression information from
  the relevant literature and then calculated their Pearson correlations with macrophage
  enrichment scores. We took the six with the strongest correlations (A–F: SP11, ITGB2,
  NCKAP1L, SASH3, PTPN6, PIK3R5) to plot scatter plots (all p-values < 0.01 and correlation
  coefficients > 0.8). (G–L) Differences in macrophage enrichment scores in high and
  low gene expression groups. We divided the top six genes among the 260 phagocytosis
  regulators into high and low expression groups according to the median. Our results
  showed that the macrophage enrichment scores were significantly higher in the high
  expression group than in the low expression group for all genes (**** p < 0.0001).
  (M–P) Functional analysis of phagocytosis regulators. (M) Functional analysis of
  biological process. (N) Functional analysis of cellular component. (O) Functional
  analysis of molecular function. (P) Functional analysis of KEGG. (Q–S) Abnormal
  phagocytosis in tumors. We examined the functional enrichment of stage groupings
  of cancer samples in a set of 34 phagocytosis-associated genes. The following three
  pathways reached significant enrichment levels (p < 0.01): (Q) WP microglia pathogen
  phagocytosis pathway; (R) HP hemophagocytosis pathway; And (S) GOBP phagocytosis
  recognition pathway.'
