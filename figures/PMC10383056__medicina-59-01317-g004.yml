caption: (A) GO enrichment of function changes in “Extracelluar factors” term of Brain-infiltrating
  Tregs vs. peripheral blood Tregs. (B) GO Terms enrichment in immune-related pathway
  of Brain-infiltrating Tregs vs. peripheral blood Tregs. (C) qPCR results of left
  hemisphere brain tissue after 1 day and 3 days after SAH onset of sham-operated
  group, SAH group and Tregs infusion group mice. (‘*’ vs. sham, p < 0.05, ‘**’ vs.
  sham, p < 0.01, ‘***’ vs. sham, p < 0.001, ‘****’ vs. sham, p < 0.0001; ‘#’ vs.
  SAH + PBS, p < 0.05, ‘##’ vs. SAH + PBS, p < 0.01, ‘####’ vs. SAH + PBS, p < 0.0001).
