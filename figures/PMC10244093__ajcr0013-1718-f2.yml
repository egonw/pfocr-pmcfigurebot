caption: 'Linc00662 was identified as a m6A-enriched lncRNA in PC cells. A. MeRIP
  sequencing analysis showed that the knockdown of METTL3 significantly reduced the
  number of unique m6A genes in PANC-1 cells. B. MeRIP sequencing analysis showed
  that the knockdown of METTL3 significantly reduced the number of unique m6A peaks
  in PANC-1 cells. C. MeRIP sequencing revealed that the knockdown of METTL3 caused
  4631 hypomethyladenosine RNAs and 3151 hypermethyladenosine RNAs in PANC-1 cells.
  D. RNA sequencing revealed that the knockdown of METTL3 caused 938 downregulated
  RNAs and 461 upregulated RNAs in PANC-1 cells. E. An interaction analysis of MeRIP
  and RNA sequencing screened five hypomethyladenosine lncRNAs (OIP5-AS1, AC021078.1,
  MAGI2-AS3, MIR100HG, Linc00662) in METTL3-knockdown PANC-1 cells, which were all
  downregulated at the RNA level. F. The expression of the five lncRNAs was examined
  in PC cells using qPCR and the results showed that Linc00662 showed a consistent
  downregulation in the two strains of METTL3-knockdown PC cells. G. Correlation analysis
  indicated a positive relationship between METTL3 and Linc00662 expressions in PC
  tissues (P = 2.1e-08) using an online bioinformatics analysis tool (GEPIA). H. The
  m6A peak on Linc00662 was located on chromosome 19 (27723041~27732875), which is
  consistent with the Linc00662-201 transcript. I. Schematic diagram of m6A motifs
  on Linc00662. The m6A peak was located on the third exon (exon 3) of Linc00662 containing
  four m6A motifs: A341, A672, A841, and A1725. J. The m6A motifs on Linc00662 were
  predicted using the online tool SRAMP. Three of the four m6A motifs were covered
  with moderate or low confidence. Red arrows indicate the m6A motifs: A341, A672,
  and A841. K. Four m6A motifs on Linc00662 were confirmed in PC cells using MeRIP-qPCR.
