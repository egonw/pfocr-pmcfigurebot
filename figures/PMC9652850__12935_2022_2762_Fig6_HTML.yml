caption: Enrichment analysis and TMB analysis based on the CRL prognostic signature
  in high- and low-risk HNSCC patients. a, b GO and KEGG analysis showing immune-related
  biological processes and pathway were enriched. c The TMB scores between high-risk
  and low-risk groups. d K–M survival analysis of the TMB score. e K–M survival analysis
  of the risk score combined with the TMB score. The waterfall graphs of most frequently
  mutated genes in high-risk group (f) and in low-risk group (g)
article_title: Identification and validation of cuproptosis-related LncRNA signatures
