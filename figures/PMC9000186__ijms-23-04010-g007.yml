caption: S1P-induced signaling pathways regulate cell survival in oxidant-induced
  kidney injury. SphK1 prevents ROS-induced apoptosis by activating pro-survival HIF-1α/HSP27.
  HIF-1α activates SphK1. SphK1 functions as anti-apoptotic by activating ERK/PI3K/Akt/PKB
  and by inhibiting apoptotic p38MAPK, while SphK2 has the opposite effect. Conversely,
  ERK activates SphK1. SphK1 activates IGF/IGFBP-3 and vice versa and VEGF, ameliorating
  ROS-induced apoptosis by activating ERK/PI3K/Akt/PKB. SphK1 inhibits JNK and PP2A,
  thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Conversely, PP2A inhibits SphK1, leading to apoptosis.
