caption: Types of cell death induced by S. aureus. The multiple toxins of S. aureus
  can induce multiple modes of cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis,
  and cell autophagy, and play a role in diseases as diverse as renal abscesses, septic
  arthritis, cancer, bacteremia, chronic sinusitis, pneumonia, venous infections,
  sepsis, psoriasis, and diseases caused by MRSA. Blue arrows represent apoptotic
  pathways; purple arrows represent the pyroptosis cell death pathway; yellow arrows
  represent the necroptotic pathway; green arrows represent the autophagic pathway.
