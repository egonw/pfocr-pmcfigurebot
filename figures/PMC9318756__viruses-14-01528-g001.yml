caption: HIV-1 Gag precursor containing late domains that hijack the host Endosomal
  Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery components and cellular
  adaptors to facilitate virus assembly and budding. (A) The peptide sequences containing
  L domains, which are indicated within structural precursors of several retroviruses,
  including Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1), Human Immunodeficiency Virus
  type 2 (HIV-2), Human T Cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K
  (HML-2), Prototypic Foamy Viruses (PFV), Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), Equine Infectious
  Anemia Virus (EIAV), Feline Immunodeficiency Virus(FIV), Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus
  (MMTV), Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV), Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV)m and Mason–Pfizer
  Monkey Virus (M-PMV) are illustrated. (B) A schematic representation of late domains
  hijacking ESCRT machinery components and cellular adaptors in the HIV-1 replication
  cycle is shown. The lower image indicates the formation of multivesicular bodies’
  (MVBs’) vesicles on late endosomes that contain cargo destined for lysosomal degradation.
  MVB formation requires the activity of ESCRT complexes I, II, and III, which are
  sequentially or concentrically recruited to the endosomal membrane to sequester
  cargo proteins and drive vascularization into the endosome to regulate the vacuolar
  protein sorting pathway as well as the formation of vesicles that bud away from
  the cytoplasm. The upper image indicates HIV-1 Gag containing L domains that can
  hijack the ESCRT complex, which was originally used for MVB biogenesis for viral
  assembly and budding (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein (VPS), Multivesicular
  Body (MVB); Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101); Charged multivesicular body
  protein (CHMP); Galectin-3 (Gal3); Expanded access program (EAP); Ubiquitin (Ub);
  Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS); Signal transducing
  adaptor molecule (STAM)).
