caption: The phylogenetic tree of proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (orange dots),
  Populus trichocarpa (pink dots), and Betula pendula (blue dots). The tree is drawn
  to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances
  used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The numbers shown next to the branches represent
  the results of the bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The access codes of the A.
  thaliana and P. trichocarpa proteins in the TAIR and Phytozome databases are indicated
  next to the corresponding proteins.
