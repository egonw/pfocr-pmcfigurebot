caption: RNA‐seq of transcriptional changes in the corpus callosum. (A) Heatmap illustration
  showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the IMRCs group and the 2VO
  group. Colouring indicates the log2‐transformed fold change. (B) Volcano plot showing
  major differentially expressed genes. (C) KEGG pathway analysis showed an enrichment
  of pathways involved in MAPK signalling. (D) GO pathway analysis of representative
  profiles of genes involved in biological process, cellular component, and molecular
  function. N = 3. BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function
article_title: Human ESC‐derived immunity‐ and matrix‐ regulatory cells ameliorated
  white matter damage and vascular cognitive impairment in rats subjected to chronic
  cerebral hypoperfusion.
