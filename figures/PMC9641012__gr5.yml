caption: KEGG enrichment analysis showing the significantly enriched pathways for
  upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) DEPs in Polydora-infected Yesso scallops.
  The x-axis shows the enrichment score. The left y-axis shows the KEGG pathway. The
  colour and size of each point represent the p-values and numbers of proteins enriched
  in a particular pathway.
article_title: Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the molecular mechanism of
  the Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) in response to Polydora infection.
