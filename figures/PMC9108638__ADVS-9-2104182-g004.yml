caption: A) Schematic illustration of the in vivo experimental design. B) Representative
  flow cytometric analysis images and C) quantification of tumor MDSCs (CD11b+Gr‐1+)
  gating on CD45+ cells (n = 4). D) Flow cytometry analysis of H2DCF MFI in MDSCs
  from various study groups (n = 4). E) Representative flow cytometric analysis of
  tumor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells gating on CD3+ cells, and F,G) their statistical data
  (n = 4). H) Quantitative analysis of CD8+IFN‐γ+ tumor T cells by flow cytometry
  (n = 4). I) Western blot analysis of A2AR expression levels in whole‐cell extracts
  from 4T1 tumor tissues. The gels were run in parallel. J) Characterization of DC
  maturation in lymph nodes by staining CD86, CD40, and MHCII antibodies (gating on
  CD11c+, n = 4). K) IFN‐γ and L) TNF‐α serum levels were detected using ELISA (n
  = 4). The proportion of M) CD8+ T cells gating on CD3+, N) CD4+ T cells gating on
  CD3+, and O) CD11b+Gr‐1+ MDSCs gating on CD45+ from the spleens of each group (n
  = 4). P) MDSC ROS content in each group (n = 4). Data are expressed as the means
  ± SD. Statistical significance is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  and ****p < 0.0001 compared with the PPDAIn PTT group, and ns represents no significant
  difference.
