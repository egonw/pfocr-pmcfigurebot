caption: 'Expression level of phenylpropanoid pathway genes during development of
  F. chiloensis fruit and in response to ABA treatment. In the short-term treatment,
  fruit at C2 stage was immersed in 1 mM ABA or 100 µM Fluridon (FLD). In the long-term
  treatment the pedicel of the fruit submerged in 1 mM ABA or only buffer. Changes
  in the expression level of each gene during fruit development are shown on the left-hand
  side of the figure; in the center the effect of ABA/Fluridon in the short-term treatment;
  on the right-hand side the effect of ABA in the long-term treatment. The expression
  level of genes from the first portion of the phenylpropanoid pathway was determined
  through qPCR analysis: FcPAL2, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 2 (A–C); FcPAL4, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase 4 (D–F); FcC4H, trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase 1 (G–I); Fc4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase (J–L). In expression analysis during development progress of F. chiloensis,
  different letters indicate significant differences between fruit stages (one-way
  ANOVA with Dunnett correction post hoc). In ABA short-term treatments, asterisks
  or circles indicate significant differences compared to time 0 for each hormone/inhibitor
  treatment (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett correction post hoc).
  For ABA long-term treatment, asterisks indicate significant differences between
  treatments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01), different letters indicate significant differences
  between days of ABA treatment, and bars with asterisks indicate significant difference
  between days of control group; two-way ANOVA with Tukey correction post hoc test
  was used.'
