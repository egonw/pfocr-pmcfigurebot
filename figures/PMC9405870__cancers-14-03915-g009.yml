caption: Overexpression of FAM107A inhibited the growth of PCa cells in vivo. (A)
  Comparison of tumor model sizes in the pc-Vector pc-FAM107A group. (B) Comparison
  of the weight of tumors in the pc-Vector pc-FAM107A group. (C) Ki67 and FAM107A
  expression in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. (D) Western blotting
  was used to analyze the changes in Vimentin, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 proteins in the
  tumors of the pc-FAM107A pc-Vector group. ** for p < 0.01.
