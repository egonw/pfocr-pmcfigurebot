figure_title: Correlation analysis of phosphorylated peptides and proteins implicates
  Tsc2 Ser664 in MTOR regulation in corticostriatal axon development
caption: '(A) Correlation analysis workflow. Spearman rank correlation is calculated
  for each protein and phosphopeptide pair across time points. One protein may have
  multiple phosphopeptide-protein pairs, yielding multiple correlation values. False-discovery
  rate was controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg approach.(B) Distribution of protein-phosphopeptide
  correlations. Left-skewed histogram (bin width = 1). Most phosphopeptides correlate
  with their respective protein expression across time. (C) Classification of protein-phosphopeptide
  correlations. Cutoff for correlated peptides, Spearman correlation ≥0. Of 1800 phosphopeptides,
  1344 are positively correlated with proteins by their temporal expression at 10%
  false discovery rate (FDR). A small proportion of peptides (59 of 309 phosphopeptides)
  are decorrelated (inversely correlated) at 10% FDR. 42 phosphopeptides decrease
  in abundance as protein levels increases, while 17 phosphopeptides show the opposite
  pattern. (D) TSC2 and TSC2_Ser664 expression. Log2 abundance for TSC2 (open circles)
  and TSC2_Ser664 (solid circles) were normalized to the neonatal time point (Spearman
  rank correlation: –0.570, FDR = 0.009. n=5 for each time point. Error bars represent
  SEM).(E) Expression heatmap for proteins and phosphosites in the TSC2-RHEB-MTOR
  signaling pathway. Log2 protein expression was normalized to the neonate time point.
  Log2 phosphopeptide signal was normalized to the corresponding protein abundance
  and to the neonate time point. (F) Model for MTOR-mediated growth cone collapse.'
