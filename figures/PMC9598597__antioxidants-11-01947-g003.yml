caption: Mechanism of thymol in relieving inflammation. Cells receive various stimuli
  and activate IκB kinases (IκKs) through the TLR4 signaling pathway, and then IκB
  proteins are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, and NF-κB dimers are released.
  The NF-κB dimer is then further activated through various post-translational modifications
  and translocated into the nucleus to bind to target genes to promote pro-inflammatory
  gene transcription. In addition, by activating the MAPKs family, it can promote
  the expression of c-jun terminal kinases (JNK) 1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), and p38 for activation, thereby promoting the nuclear entry of activator
  protein 1 (AP-1) to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Thymol inhibits
  the dissociation of the IκB protein and NF-κB dimer and the activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway to relieve inflammation.
