figure_title: KSEA & MoBaS analysis
caption: a KSEA on whole hearts pTyr enrichment and TMT pTyr Myofilament enrichment
  data. Heat maps report KSEA results according to normalized scores (i.e., TgErbB2/Ntg,
  R403Q-αMyHC/Ntg, etc.). Only kinases shared between data sets are included, therefore
  present in Tg and Ntg. Asterisks indicate the statistical significance of p < 0.05.
  Red represents a positive score, and blue is a negative score. Red rectangle highlights
  groups of activated kinases clustered together and are predominant in R403Q-αMyHC,
  whereas the blue rectangle highlights suppressed kinases that clustered and are
  predominant on TgErbB2 whole hearts. b MoBaS identified a tightly interconnected
  subnetwork involved in growth factors signaling (ERBB, PDGFRA, and EGFR1). Represented
  by the top-scoring PPI subnetwork called Module 1 was identified on TgErbB2 whole
  heart pTyr enrichment and compared to R403Q-αMyHC. c KSEA on Module 1 group of substrates,
  MsigDB and PTMsigDB. d Second top-scoring PPI subnetwork called Module 2 was identified
  on R403Q-αMyHC whole heart pTyr enrichment and compared to TgErbB2. e KSEA on Module
  2 group of substrates show activated kinases in R403Q-αMyHC. Results from PTMsigDB
  and MSigDB analysis identified EGFR1, Actin cytoskeleton, ERBB and Focal Adhesion
  signaling. Each node is a phosphoprotein represented by its most significant peptide
  on PPI modules. Node color is based on Log2 fold-change relative to NTG. The scale
  is noted by FC and a bar colored from blue to red.
