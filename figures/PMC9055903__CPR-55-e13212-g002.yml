caption: Flow cytometric pattern of CD41a expression on PRP (A) and ELISA‐tested concentration
  of PDGF, TGF‐β, IGF‐1 and EGF in hPL (B). Superoxide dismutase content of human
  dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with treatment of human platelet lysate (hPL) or growth
  factors (C). Relative mRNA expressions (D) and protein expressions (E) of HDFs with
  treatment of hPL or growth factors. Data expressed as mean ± SD. Different symbols
  (a, ab, abc, b, bc, bcd, c, cd and d) indicate significant difference among groups
  (Fisher's least significant difference, p < 0.05), and the values decrease with
  the order from a to d. We repeated the experiments three times to ensure the accuracy
  of the experiments

  through NF‐κB signalling pathway: In vitro and in vivo mechanistic and clinical
  studies.'
