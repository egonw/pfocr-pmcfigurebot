caption: Inhibition of miR-222-3p regulates Wnt signaling pathway. (a) The mRNA level
  of β-catenin gene was analyzed by qRT-PCR in con, anti-NC, anti-222 and anti-222+ siR-Ddit4
  groups. The β-actin gene was used as a control. (b) The mRNA level of TCF4 gene
  was analyzed by qRT-PCR in con, anti-NC, anti-222 and anti-222+ siR-Ddit4 groups.
  The β-actin gene was used as a control. (c) The β-catenin, TCF4, C-myc, Cycin D1
  protein level in con, anti-NC, anti-222 and anti-222+ siR-Ddit4 groups was evaluated
  via western blot and the expression of GADPH was used for confirming equal loading
article_title: miR-222-3p is involved in neural tube closure by directly targeting
  Ddit4 in RA induced NTDs mouse model.
