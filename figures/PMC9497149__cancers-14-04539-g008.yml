caption: Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by signaling pathways.
  The EMT process is activated by many signaling pathways involving extracellular
  cytokines and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). TGFÎ² is the master regulator, activating
  not just the canonical Smad signaling pathway but also numerous other signaling
  pathways. It has been shown that the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway is also crucial
  to EMT. Upon activation of EMT, the transcription factors (TFs) of the snail family
  and mesenchymal genes are upregulated, while the epithelial genes are downregulated
  [,]. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
