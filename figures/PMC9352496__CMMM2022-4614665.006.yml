caption: Schematic diagram of gluconeogenesis regulation in sheep raised in different
  grazing periods. The rate of gluconeogenesis was regulated by several enzymes, including
  PEPCPK, PC, G6P, and GLUT2. FOX01 plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis by promoting
  the liver's expression of PEPCK and G6P. p53 and SIRT6 regulate gluconeogenesis
  by controlling the expression of Fox01, and INSR regulates the expression of FOX01
  by increasing the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. The ellipses marked in red color
  indicate the upregulated parameters, while the black dotted lines indicate that
  INSR did not regulate the expression of FOX01 via activating the PI3K pathway in
  the gluconeogenesis pathway.
