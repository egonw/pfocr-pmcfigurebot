caption: Viability of PC-12 cells under the influence of H2O2 (A), an PC-12 cells
  generation under the influence of H2O2 (B), Viability of PC-12 cells under the influence
  of peptides (C), PC-12 cells’ intracellular ROS scavenging capacities of different
  concentrations of peptides and different incubation time under oxidative stress
  induced by H2O2 (D). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. The results marked with
  the different letters (a, b, c, d and e)are significantly different (p < 0.05).
