caption: Identification of HGF as an alternative biomarker of TLR5-MYD88 and IL17RA
  pathway. A Before treatment of responders (blue) and non-responders (orange), three
  months after treatment of responders (green) and non-responders (red). The Pearson's
  correlation coefficient (r), and the P-value calculated from linear regression are
  shown. B Comparison of HGF levels before treatment data. The P-value calculated
  by the Mann–Whitney U test is shown. C Correlation between each gene’s expression.
  The number in each box represents Pearson’s correlation coefficient. D ROC curves
  for no response to abatacept. E–H Expression of HGF in immune cells using single-cell
  data from peripheral blood (E, F) and synovium (G, H). CD4, CD4 + T cell; CD8. CD8 + T
  cell; NK. NK cell; B. B cell; Mono, monocyte
