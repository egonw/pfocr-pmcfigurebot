caption: 'The protein expressions of key enzymes of the energy metabolic pathway of
  the myocardial tissues in ascitic broilers were measured using Western blotting:
  (A) the key enzymes PKM2, HK2, PFK1, and PFK2 in the glycolytic pathway of the ascitic
  broilers’ myocardial tissue; (B) the key enzymes OGDH, IDH2, and CS in the TCA cycle
  of the ascitic broilers’ myocardial tissue; (C) the key enzymes CPT-1A and p-ACC
  of the fatty acid oxidation pathway of the ascitic broilers’ myocardial tissue;
  (D) two important enzymes, PDHE1 and LDHB, of the glucose metabolism of the ascitic
  broilers’ myocardial tissue. The data are presented as means ± SEM. The experiment
  was repeated three times independently. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 indicate a significant
  difference from the control group.'
