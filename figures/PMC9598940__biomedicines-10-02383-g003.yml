caption: Synergistic effect of the combination between NAR and HSP. The effect of
  the drug combination on SIRT2 activity was calculated and visualized using SynergyFinder
  2.0 software through the ZIP reference model. The synergy score is expressed as
  the mean of all scores for the dose-response analysis, while the maps shown are
  representative of three different experimental sessions. The red, white, and green
  regions of the graphs indicate the synergy, additivity, and antagonism, respectively.
