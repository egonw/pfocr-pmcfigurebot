caption: 'CPP induces the differentiation of HDFs into vascular endothelial-like cells
  by promoting the expression of HEY1. (a–e) HDFs were treated with CPP (0, 1, 10
  or 20 μM) for 24 h, 48 h, 4 days (D4), 6 days (D6) and 10 days (D10), respectively,
  then qPCR and Western blot were conducted to verify the expression of HEY1. (f–k)
  After knocking down HEY1 (siHEY1-1: 40 nM), HDFs were treated with CPP (10 μM) for
  6 days, and Western blot was used to detect the protein levels of HEY1 (33 kDa),
  CD31, CD133, Collagen 1 and Vimentin. Higher-molecular weight bands may represent
  post-translationally modified HEY1 proteins. β-actin (ACTB) was used as a loading
  control. Data are presented as means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  n = 3.'
