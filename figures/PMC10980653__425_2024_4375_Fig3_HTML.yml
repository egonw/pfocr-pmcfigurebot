caption: Heat stress exerts a significant impact on protein translation pathway. a
  Gene expression changes in ER-mediated protein folding during 4-h and 7-day heat
  treatment in R. moulmainense. The diagram displays relative expression changes of
  genes encoding different enzymes (Suppl. Table S4, S5). Red, green and white boxes
  represent up-regulated DEGs, down-regulated DEGs, and genes with no significant
  changes compared to mock-inoculated plants (adjusted P < 0.05), respectively. The
  regulation of protein homeostasis in the ER was adapted from Sun et al. (). b Verification
  for mRNA-seq data about ER protein folding pathway by RT-qPCR. The expression of
  RoGAPDH was used as the control. c The ubiquitin–proteasome system and its cellular
  components. The module was adapted from the KEGG website and have obtained the KEGG
  copyright permission (Kanehisa and Goto ; Kanehisa et al. ). The lower part shows
  the heatmap of DEGs related to ubiquitin–proteasome system in R. moulmainense leaves
  after heat- and mock treatment for 4 h and 7 days. d Verification for mRNA-seq data
  about ubiquitin–proteasome pathway by RT-qPCR. The expression of RoGAPDH was used
  as the control. R in b and d represents the correlation coefficient between the
  expression patterns of mRNA-seq data and RT-qPCR results, determined using the two-tailed
  Student’s t-test, and mean values ± SE, n = 3
