caption: Integration of ocular data in AMD(A) Normalized KIT gene expression in bulk
  RNA-seq from RPE/choroid. ∗∗FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5. Boxplot is drawn from
  25th to 75th percentiles, horizontal bars are medians, and whiskers show ranges.(B)
  Violin plot showing normalized KIT expression across major cell types in sNuc-seq.(C)
  Genome tracks showing accessibility of KIT.(D) Immunohistochemistry staining for
  c-KIT/CD117. Representative images from control macula (left panel and insets 1
  and 2), periphery (middle panel and insets 3 and 4), and macular sections of GA
  lesion borders (right panel). Choroidal melanocytes are CD117+ pigmented cells (insets
  1 and 3), and mast cells are CD117+ cells with no pigmentation (insets 2 and 4).
  Dashed lines indicate removal of extra white space between the RPE and neural retina
  that was caused by artifactual postmortem retinal detachment.(E and F) Normalized
  gene expression in bulk RNA-seq from RPE/choroid for (E) FRZB and (F) TLE2. ∗∗FDR < 0.05
  and fold change > 1.5. Boxplots are drawn from 25th to 75th percentiles, horizontal
  bars are medians, and whiskers show ranges.(G) Dotplot showing expression in sNuc-seq
  for WNT pathway genes enriched in RPE.(H) Genome tracks showing accessibility of
  FRZB. Correlations between peaks and gene expression are shown as arcs connecting
  the peak and the transcription start site of FRZB. R, Pearson correlation coefficient.See
