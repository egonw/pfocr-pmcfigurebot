caption: Molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis triggered by excess Cu. The transport
  of excess Cu into cells induces mitochondrial stress and activates the SLC7A11 signaling
  pathway, leading to ferroptosis. This process is triggered by the inhibition of
  systemic Xc- or GPX4 activity, ultimately resulting in cell death. The peroxidation
  of PUFA is believed to be a significant contributor to lipid ROS production during
  ferroptosis. Additionally, excess Cu-iron is essential for the execution of ferroptosis.
  It promotes the degradation of ATP7A11, leading to Cu retention in cells, ROS accumulation,
  and GPX4 activation. The latter is a key regulator of iron death that inhibits lipid
  ROS production by catalyzing the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides.
