figure_title: Knockdown of circSCAF8 can suppress the ability of proliferation, invasion,
  and migration of PCa cells
caption: A The knockdown efficiency of the two shRNAs that target circSCAF8 in PC3
  and 22RV1 cells. B The expression level of circSCAF8 after transfected with circSCAF8
  expression vectors in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. C qRT-PCR analysis of SCAF8 mRNA expression
  after treatment with sh1-circSCAF8 and circSCAF8 expression vectors. D–F The proliferation
  ability of PC3 and 22RV1 cells after knockdown of circSCAF8 was measured by CCK-8
  D, colony formation (E), and EDU F assays. G The invasion ability of PC3 and 22RV1
  cells was determined using a transwell invasion assay. H, I Transwell migration
  and wound healing assays were implemented to assess the migration ability of PC3
  and 22RV1 cells after the knockdown of circSCAF8. J Cell cycle analysis revealed
  that PCa cells were blocked at the G1 phase after knockdown of circSCAF8. Error
  bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
