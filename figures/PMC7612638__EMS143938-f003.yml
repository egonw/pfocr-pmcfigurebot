figure_title: Epigenomes of untreated cells are primed with co-accumulation of H3K27me3
  and H3K4me3
caption: a. UMAP representation of scChIP-seq H3K4me3 datasets, cells are colored
  according to the sample of origin - untreated cells (D0) and persister cells (D60).
  b. (Up) Cumulative H3K4me3 enrichment profiles over FOXQ1 in untreated cells (D0)
  and persister cells (D60). ‘ns’ stands for not significant after differential testing
  comparing untreated and persister cells. (Down) H3K27me3→H3K4me3 and H3K27me3→IgG
  sequential ChIP-seq profiles of FOXQ1 in the untreated population. Comparative tracks
  show enrichment over IgG control with associated odd ratio and adjusted P value
  from Fisher’s exact test adjusted for multiple testing. c. Doughnut chart displaying
  the fraction of persister genes (n = 168) with H3K27me3 loss upon 5-FU treatment
  or with bivalent chromatin at TSS in untreated cells. Candidate master TFs - among
  persister genes - are indicated with the number of persister genes potentially regulated
  by the corresponding TF in parentheses. d. (Left) H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 chromatin
  profiles of human tumor samples for candidate master TFs (Patient_39, Patient_95
  and Patient_172). The percentage of tumoral cells are indicated for each sample.
  (Right) H3K4me3→H3K27me3 and H3K4me3→IgG sequential ChIP-seq profiles of untreated
  population of the three derived PDX_models (PDX_39, PDX_95 and PDX_172). Comparative
  tracks show enrichment over IgG control with associated odds ratio and adjusted
  P value from Fisher’s exact test adjusted for multiple testing. e. H3K27me3 and
  H3K4me3 chromatin profiles for FOXQ1 of 6 additional human tumor samples. The percentage
  of tumoral cells are indicated for each sample. f. Dotplot showing the top pathways
  enriched in genes displaying a dual H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichment in human tumor
  samples. Color of the dot corresponds to adjusted P values - calculated with hypergeometric
  test adjusted for multiple testing - and the size of the dot corresponds to the
  gene ratio, i.e. the fraction of bivalent genes belonging to this pathway. Stars
  indicate human tumor samples used to establish our PDX models.
