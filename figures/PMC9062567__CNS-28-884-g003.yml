caption: Circ_0055412 is significantly high expressed in glioma cells and features
  as the stable loop structure. (A) RT‐qPCR was performed to quantify the expression
  of six circRNAs cyclized from CAPG in glioma cell lines and normal cell line. (B)
  Schematic illustrated the generation of circ_0055412. (C) Gel electrophoresis was
  employed to test the structure of circ_0055412 with the help of divergent primers
  of cDNA. (D) RT‐qPCR was carried out to evaluate the stability of circ_0055412 and
  linear‐CAPG expression in glioma cells treated with RNase R. (E) The stability of
  circ_0055412 and linear CAPG in glioma cells was tested after the treatment of Act
