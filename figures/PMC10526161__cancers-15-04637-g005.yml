caption: Correlation of the galactose metabolic pathway with less-differentiated cancer
  cells. (A) tSNE plot of 84,854 cells (GSE176078) color-coded to indicate cell type.
  (B) Sub-clustering cancer cells into 16 clusters, as indicated by the color-coded
  legend. (C,D) tSNE and violin (D) plots showing the NES of the galactose metabolism
  pathway for each cluster. (E) Violin plot showing the expression of UGP2, HK1, and
  FPKL for each cluster. (F,G) tSNE (F) and violin (G) plot showing the CytoTRACE
  score for each cluster. (H) Dot plot showing the NES of galactose metabolism pathway
  positively correlated with the CytoTRACE score. (I) Lollipop plot showing the expression
  of critical genes in the galactose metabolism pathway positively correlated with
  the CytoTRACE score.
