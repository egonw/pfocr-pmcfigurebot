caption: 'Classical mechanisms of neovascularization. A: Classical Wnt pathway. When
  there is no Wnt signal, LRP, Frizzled, DV1 and Axin are closely combined with β-catenin.
  In the presence of Wnt signaling, the complex disintegrates, and β-catenin enters
  the nucleus, binds to TCF/LEF, transcribes multiple downstream signals such as c-Myc
  and ultimately promotes neovascularization; B: Under normoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-α inhibits the binding of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)
  and P300, which causes hydroxylation of HIF, then leads to proteasome degradation
  and inactivation after VHL ubiquitination. When hypoxia occurs, prolyl hydroxylase
  domains become inactive, allowing HIF-α to migrate to the nucleus, where it dimerizes
  with HIF-β. The dimer binds to the hypoxia response elements of specific genes in
  DNA, transcribes thousands of genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  and promotes neovascularization; C: High glucose induces Slit2/Roundabout 1 (Robo1)
  binding, and Robo1 inhibits the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)
  /protein kinase B (Akt) and HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway and inhibits angiogenesis.
  PI3K inhibitors also inhibit the HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway. After activation
  of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, a variety of cytokines including VEGF will be
  transcribed to promote angiogenesis.'
