caption: SUFU is associated with LATS1(A and B) Immunoblot (IB) analysis of the levels
  of P-LATS1 and total LATS1 following SUFU overexpression (A) in HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231
  cells or SUFU depletion (B) in HCC1954 MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells. GAPDH as a loading
  control. Numbers indicate the normalized ratio of P-LATS1 over total LATS1 signals
  obtained by densitometric analysis.(C) IB analysis of ACSL4 and AXL levels in LATS1-depleted
  MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells upon overexpressing SUFU. GAPDH as a loading control.(D)
  HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids, cell lysates were subjected
  to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-V5 and IB with the antibodies against V5 and
  Myc, respectively.(E) Confocal analysis of the co-localization of ectopic Flag-tagged
  SUFU and Myc-tagged LATS1 in MDA-MB-231 cells; scale bar, 50μm.(F) HCC1806 whole-cell
  lysates (WCL) collected from 10cm2 dishes were subjected to IP with an anti-SUFU
  antibody or IgG control. IB analysis for SUFU and LATS1. GAPDH as a loading control.(G)
  A schematic depicting the regions in SUFU for mapping.(H) IB analysis of V5-SUFU
  and its deletion mutants immunoprecipitated complexes using the indicated antibodies.(I)
  Luciferase reporter assay analysis of the effects of SUFU wild type and its deletion
  mutants on YAP activity. MCF-7 cells were transfected with the 8xGTIIC-luciferase
  reporter together with SUFU wild type and its deletion mutants. Myc-tagged YAP and
  Myc-tagged LATS1 were used as the positive or negative control respectively. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).
