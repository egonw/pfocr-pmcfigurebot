caption: RUT restrains the LPS-induced apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells. (A and B) Apoptosis
  was detected by TUNEL assay. Magnification, x200. (C) Protein expression levels
  of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were measured by western
  blotting. Results are presented as the mean Â± SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  RUT, rutaecarpine.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
