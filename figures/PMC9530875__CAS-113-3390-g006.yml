caption: NEDD4 binding protein 3 (N4BP3) promoted angiogenesis through vascular endothelial
  growth factor A (VEGFA). (A) Angiogenesis‐related factors were screened from the
  medium collected from Huh‐7‐ov‐N4BP3 cells and corresponding control cells by proteomic
  Ab array. Among the angiogenesis‐promoting cytokines, only VEGFA levels were significantly
  increased after N4BP3 overexpression. (B) Quantitative PCR assays were used to assess
  VEGFA mRNA levels in cells of each group. (C) ELISA assays were undertaken to evaluate
  VEGFA levels in cell supernatants of each group. (D) Through tube formation assays,
  it was established that the ability to promote the formation of complete tubular
  structures of HUVECs decreased significantly when anti‐VEGFA Abs were added to supernatants
  of cells in the Huh‐7‐ov‐N4BP3 group. In contrast, when the purified protein (VEGFA)
  was added to the supernatant of cells in the Lm3‐sg‐N4BP3 group, the ability of
  HUVECs to form complete tubular structures was significantly improved. (E) Through
  transcriptome sequencing and analysis of corresponding results, we found that N4BP3
  might promote hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis through the STAT3 signaling
  pathway. GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
