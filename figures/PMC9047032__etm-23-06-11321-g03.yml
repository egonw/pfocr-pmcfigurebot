caption: Oxaliplatin enhances the promotive role of erastin in ferroptosis and oxidative
  stress of colorectal cancer cells. (A and B) Detection of relative total iron level
  and Fe2+ level in HT29 cells was carried out using an iron ion test kit in the groups
  of control, erastin, oxaliplatin as well as oxaliplatin (3 µM) + erastin. (C and
  D) Western blotting was used to detect the levels of the ferroptosis-related proteins
  GPX4, FTH1 and transferrin in the control, erastin and oxaliplatin groups, as well
  as in the oxaliplatin (3 µM) + erastin group. (E-G) ELISA was used to detect the
  levels of the oxidative stress-related factors ROS, MDA and GSH in the control,
  erastin and oxaliplatin groups, as well as in the oxaliplatin (3 µM) + erastin group.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. GPX4, glutathione
  peroxidase 4; FTH1, ferritin heavy chain 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  GSH, glutathione.
