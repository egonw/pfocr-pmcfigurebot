caption: Prediction of pathway related to Malassezia globosa and PD-L1 expression.
  (a) The enrichment of metabolic pathways between the PD-L1-High and PD-L1-Low group.
  (b) The association between PD-L1 expression and LIPASYN pathway. (c) The association
  between Malassezia globosa and LIPASYN pathway. (d) The enrichment of LIPASYN pathway
  in the different subgroups of Malassezia globosa and PD-L1 expression. (e) The metabolism-related
  processes were enriched.
