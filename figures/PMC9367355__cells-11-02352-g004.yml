caption: Role of lncRNAs in the regulation of the stem phenotype in colorectal cancer.
  (A) lncRNA H19 functions as a sponge by sequestering miR-141, a negative regulator
  of Î²-catenin mRNA, generating the activation of the WNT signaling pathway and increasing
  the proportion of ALDH cancer stem cells+, among other features. (B) Lnc34a recruits
  chromatin remodelers to the promoter region of miRNA-34a, blocking its expression.
  This allows cancer stem cells to self-renew.
