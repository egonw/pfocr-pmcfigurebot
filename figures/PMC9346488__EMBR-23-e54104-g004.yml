figure_title: Bcl6 is expressed in superficial callosal projection neurons and a target
  gene of Bcl11a
caption: 'AImmunohistochemistry of Bcl6 (red), Bcl11a (green), and Satb2 (blue) in
  P2 wild‐type neocortex.BVenn diagram displaying the proportions of Bcl6 neurons
  overlapping with Bcl11a and Satb2 expressing cells. The percentage of each labeled
  cell population is given in relation to all labeled cells (Bcl6+ and Bcl11a+ and
  Satb2+, in total 4,479 cells).CImmunohistochemistry of Bcl6 (red), Bcl11a (green),
  and Cux1 (blue) in P2 wild‐type neocortex.DVenn diagram displaying the proportions
  of Bcl6 neurons overlapping with Bcl11a and Cux1 expressing cells. The percentage
  of each labeled cell population is given in relation to all labeled cells (Bcl6+
  and Bcl11a+ and Cux1+, in total 4,301 cells).EScheme of the Bcl6 gene locus displaying
  the start codon (ATG) at +11.2 kb relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS).
  A regulatory element (RE) in the first intron at +982 bp contains a conserved binding
  motif (TGACCA, in red) of Bcl11a.FChIP analysis using a Bcl11a antibody and P2 cortical
  tissue detects Bcl11a binding to the RE shown in (E). Negative controls include
  ChIP with unspecific IgG antibody and the precipitation of exon 5 of Bcl6 and the
  Hprt promoter. The experiment was independently repeated four times. Results are
  expressed as mean ± s.e.m.; Student''s t‐test; *P < 0.05.GLuciferase assays in HEK293
  cells transfected with control (CAG‐Ctl GFP ), Bcl11a (CAG‐Bcl11a GFP ), or Bcl11b
  (CAG‐Bcl11b GFP ) expression vector show induction of luciferase activity of the
  RE reporter construct by Bcl11a. Negative controls include a reporter construct
  for a region of exon 5 of the Bcl6 gene and co‐transfection with the closely related
  transcription factor Bcl11b. The experiment was independently repeated four times.
  Results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.; one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey''s post‐hoc
  test; ***P < 0.001. Data information: Scale bars, 50 μm.'
