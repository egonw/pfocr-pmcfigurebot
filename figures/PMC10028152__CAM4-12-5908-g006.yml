caption: miRNA let‐7c‐3p inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by directly targeting
  PIK3CA. (A) MicroRNA.org, Targetscan, and miRbase were used to analyze and predict
  the possible target genes and binding sites of let‐7c‐3p, the PIK3CA 3′‐UTR sequence,
  and the corresponding let‐7c‐3p 5′‐end, and the PIK3CA 3′‐UTR mutation sequence.
  (B) A luciferase gene reporter assay was used to detect the effect of let‐7c‐3p
  on the luciferase activity of the PIK3CA 3′‐UTR sequence. (C) The effect of let‐7c‐3p
  on PIK3CA expression in A549 and H460 cells was assessed using qRT‐PCR. (D) Western
  blot was used to detect the effect of let‐7c‐3p overexpression on PIK3CA expression
  in A549 and H460 cells (n = 3). (E) Western blot was used to assess the influence
  of let‐7c‐3p and PIK3CA overexpression on the expression of proteins related to
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in A549 and H460 cells (n = 3).
