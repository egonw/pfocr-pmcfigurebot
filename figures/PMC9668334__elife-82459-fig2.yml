figure_title: Functional annotations and validations of genes associated with genome-wide
  associations studies (GWAS) for cardiac performance
caption: '(A) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. Selected molecular functions
  (MF, left) and cellular components (CC, right) associated with cardiac performances
  at FDR < 0.05 are shown. Enrichment analysis was performed using G:profiler with
  a correction for multitesting (see Materials and methods). (B) Interaction network
  of genes associated with natural variations of cardiac performance. Direct genetic
  and physical interactions between cardiac fly GWAS genes are displayed. Nodes represent
  genes and/or proteins, edges represent interactions (blue: genetic; black: physical).
  Node shapes refer to single marker and/or epistasis GWAS, node color to the cardiac
  performances phenotype(s) for which associations were established. Genes and proteins
  highlighted in pink point to transcription factors, in green and blue to signaling
  pathways (FGF and TGFb, respectively), and in yellow to ion channels. (C) Heatmap
  representing the effects on indicated cardiac traits of heart-specific RNAi-mediated
  knockdown (KD) of 42 genes identified in GWAS for cardiac performance. Results of
  Wilcoxon rank sum test of the effects of indicated heart-specific RNAi-mediated
  gene KD (rows) for cardiac performance traits (columns), analyzed on semi-intact
  1-week females flies. Detailed data are presented in . Thirty-eight (out of 42)
  genes tested lead to significant effects on cardiac performance traits upon KD.
  Black dots indicate the trait(s) for which the corresponding gene was associated
  in GWAS. ns: not significant; *: pval <0.05; **: pval <0.01; ***: pval <0.005; ****pval
  <0.0001 (p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction).
  Comparison with heart-specific effect of random selected genes is displayed in .
  (D) Schematic drawing of BMP and activin pathways in Drosophila. (E) Genetic interactions
  between BMP and activin pathway genes. Genetic interactions tested between snooBSC234
  and sogU2 for SI and between dppd14 and babo32 for FS (other phenotypes are shown
  in ). Cardiac traits were measured on each single heterozygotes and on double heterozygotes
  flies. Two-way ANOVA reveals that the interaction between snooBSC234 and sogU2 for
  SI and between dppd14 and babo32 for FS are significant. Detailed data for interaction
  effect corresponding to all phenotypes are displayed in . Figure 2—source data 1.Collection
