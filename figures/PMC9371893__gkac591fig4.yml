caption: 'Downregulated genes are associated with the senescence phenotype. (A) Commonly
  downregulated genes in murine KO1 and KO2 cells upon loss of Ash2l were compared
  to commonly downregulated genes in three primary human cell populations () and to
  downregulated genes in human diploid fibroblasts () in response to replicative senescence.
  The number of genes is indicated that are in common between the different groups:
  A, KO1/KO2 and the genes in Lackner et al.; B, KO1/KO2 and the genes in Zirkel et al.;
  M, common genes of all three studies. Comparison KO1/KO2 with Lackner et al. and
  Zirkel et al.: P-value < 2.2e–16 (Fischer Exact test). (B) The genes in groups A,
  B and M are listed and the repression of these genes in both KO1 and KO2 cells upon
  treatment ± HOT for 5 days is indicated. (C) GO pathway analysis of the genes that
  are in common between the data sets of panel A. Adjusted P-values are indicated;
  ns, not significant. (D) KO2 cells were treated ± HOT for 5 days. H3K4me3 ChIP-qPCR
  experiments were performed with primers specific for the promoters of the indicated
  genes, which belong to the M group (panels A and B). For control, ChIP was carried
  out using IgG control antibodies. Displayed are mean values ± SD (n = 5) (** < 0.01,
  *** < 0.001).'
