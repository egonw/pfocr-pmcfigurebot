caption: Pathway diagram of DRAK2 involvement in T-cell activation. When the T-cell
  receptor receives the signal, it acts on the receptors on the surface of the endoplasmic
  reticulum via IP3 generated by PLCÎ³, resulting in the release of Ca ions from the
  endoplasmic reticulum. When STIM1 senses Ca ion deficiency, extracellular Ca ions
  will flow inward through CRAC channels. The inward flow of Ca ions stimulates the
  mitochondria to produce large amounts of ROS, which then influence the expression
  of DRAK2 through the PKD signaling pathway.
