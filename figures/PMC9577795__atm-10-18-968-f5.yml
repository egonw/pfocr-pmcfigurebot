caption: The hub genes in the co-expressed DEGs of the top 10 upregulated DELs and
  the enrichment of the NCRNA00173-co-expressed DEGs. (A) The PPI network of the co-expressed
  DEGs of the top 10 upregulated DELs. (B) The top 10 hub genes calculated by the
  degree algorithm. (C) GO-BP enrichment analysis of the NCRNA00173-co-expressed DEGs.
  (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of the NCRNA00173-co-expressed DEGs. DEG, differentially
  expressed gene; DEL, differentially expressed lncRNA; PPI, protein-protein interaction;
  GO, Gene Ontology; BP, biological process; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes.
