caption: 'Analysis of HO-3867 on cleaved caspases 8, 9 and 3 expressions in HO-3867
  with or without inhibitors of ERK1/2 (U0126)- and JNK1/2 (JNK-IN-8)-treated U2OS
  and HOS cells. (A) After pretreatment with or without 10 μM of U0126 and 1 μM of
  JNK-IN-8 for 1 h followed by 8 μM or no HO-3867 treatment for an additional 24 h,
  Western blot analysis was performed to measure expressions of cleaved caspases 3,
  8, and 9 in U2OS and HOS cells; (B) Subsequently, quantitative analysis was assessed.
  n = 3. Cleaved caspase 8: U2OS: F = 536.028, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 719.244, p < 0.001;
  cleaved caspase 9: F = 550.879, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 436.343, p < 0.001; cleaved
  caspase 3: U2OS: F = 693.877, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 2338.671, p < 0.001. a Significantly
  different, p < 0.05, when compared to control. b Significantly different, p < 0.05,
  when compared to 8 μM HO-3867. c Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared
  to U0126. d Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to U0126 and HO-3867
  treatment. e Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to JNK-IN-8.'
