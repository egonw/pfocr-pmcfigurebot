figure_title: Tg6PGDH2 is important for parasite survival
caption: (A), Diagram showing strategy to construct the conditional knockout strain
  Tg6PGDH2-cKD, using the LoxP- Cre system in the DiCre strain. (B), Diagnostic PCRs
  on a representative Tg6PGDH2-cKD clone. PCR1 and PCR2 examined the integration of
  homology templates at the 5’ and 3’ end of Tg6PGDH2, whereas PCR3 confirmed the
  deletion of the endogenous Tg6PGDH2 locus. (C), Immunofluorescence staining for
  TgALD and YFP expression in Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites treated with rapamycin for 2
  d. (D), Western blotting for checking the expression of Tg6PGDH2 in Tg6PGDH2-cKD
  parasites treated with or without rapamycin for 4 days. TgALD was included as a
  loading control. (E), Competition assay comparing the growth of Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites
  treated with rapamycin for 24 h to that of untreated parasites. (F), Plaque assay
  showing the defect in the Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites after 4 days of rapamycin treatment.
  (G), Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites pretreated for 4 days formed smaller plaques than their
  parental strain, and untreated Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites formed plaques similarly to
  DiCre. (H), Intracellular replication assay comparing parasite growth in vitro.
  Tg6PGDH2-cKD parasites were treated with rapamycin for 4 days, and then they were
  allowed to infect fresh HFF cells and grown for 24 h, subsequently, the number of
  parasites in each PV was checked by IFA. Results are means ± SEM for n = 3 independent
  experiments. (I), Survival curves of mice infected with tachyzoites of indicated
  strains. Tg6PGDH2-cKD and Δ6pgdh2 mutants were used to infect ICR mice (100 parasites/mouse,
  n = 10 mice for each strain) by intraperitoneal injection, and the survival of mice
  was followed for 30 days. *, p <0 .05, Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon tests.
