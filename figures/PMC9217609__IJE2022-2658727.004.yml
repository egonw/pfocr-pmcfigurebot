caption: '(a) The results of transwell tumor migration test showed that inhibition
  of TET3 expression significantly reduced the invasion ability of BCPAP and TPC-1
  fine cell lines; (b) Representative images of wound-healing assays using BCPAP and
  TPC-1 cells showed that inhibition of TET3 expression significantly reduced the
  migration ability. Scale bars: 25 μm. The plots below show the quantification of
  wound-healing assays. Data are shown as mean ± s.d. (n ≥ 3).'
