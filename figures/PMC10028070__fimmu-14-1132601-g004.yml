caption: Overview of multiple functions of m6A regulators in various cancers mediated
  by some signaling pathways. The core pathways regulate many biological functions
  of tumors, including tumor occurrence, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation
  metastasis, multidrug resistance, treatment response and cancer development. The
  MYC pathway, Wnt/β-Catenin pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, p53 pathway, EMT pathway,
  and other pathways are included in the key cancer pathways.
