caption: 'Ferroptosis inhibitor regulates the expression of related proteins in BMSCs.
  (a) ROS staining was performed to test the level of oxidative stress in control
  group, DEX (10−3 M) group and DEX + Fer-1 group. (b) Quantitative analysis of the
  number of ROS-positive cells per field in (a). (c) Annexin V-mCherry/SYTOX Green
  detection kit was used to detect cell death. (d) Quantitative analysis of the percentage
  of SYTOX green-positive cells in (c). (e–i) Western blot and qRT-PCR results for
  the expressions of system xc-, ACSL4, GPX4, and FSP1 were pretreated with ferroptosis
  inhibitor Ferrastatin-1 for 24 h; DEX (10−3 M) was then added for 24 h. These studies
  were performed at least 3 biological replicates. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3).
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with control group. #P < 0.05, ##P
  < 0.01, ###P < 0.005 compared with DEX group.'
