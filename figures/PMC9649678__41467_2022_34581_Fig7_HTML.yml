figure_title: Antigen-presentation pathway was downregulated in malignant cells of
  metastatic lymph node
caption: a A heatmap showing large-scale CNVs of epithelial cells (rows) from paired
  tumor tissues in 8 LNMT patients. CNVs in red indicate amplifications, while those
  in blue indicate deletions. CNVs were identified by inferCNV. b t-SNE plot of malignant
  epithelial cells identified by inferCNV malignant score. c Volcano plot showing
  the differentially expressed genes between PT and LNMT in malignant cells of patient
  8. P value < 0.05, log2 (fold change) ≥ 0.5. Statistical testing was performed by
  a two-sided Wilcoxon test. d Barplot showing top 10 normalized enrichment score
  (NES) of shared significant enriched pathways across patients. Genes ranks calculated
  by PT vs LNMT in malignant cells for each patient were used for NES calculating
  by GSEA analysis. Color represents the numbers of patients which are significant
  in same pathways. e GSEA analysis showed that genes rank in PT vs LNMT of represented
  patients are enriched in antigen presentation pathway. Left represent high gene
  rank in PT. Statistical testing was performed by permutation test. The P-values
  were corrected with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. f Circos plots showing 6 CNV
  clusters of malignant epithelial cells according to CNVs similarity for patient
  8. Cells were colored by tissue. g Bar plot showing the frequency of 6 CNV clusters
  in patient 8. h Violin plots showing the MHC I antigen presentation signature (Up)
  and MHC II antigen presentation signature (Down) of 6 CNV clusters from patient
  8. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
