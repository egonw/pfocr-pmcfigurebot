caption: 'The regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  signalling by piperlongumine (PL) was dependent upon reactive oxygen species but
  that of vitamin C (VC) was not in two gastric cancer cell lines in vitro: (a) AGS
  and KATO III cells were treated with 15 µM PL or 3 mM VC with/without 5 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine
  (NAC) preincubation for 48 h and then they were subjected to Western blot analysis
  to measure the protein levels of p-STAT3 and STAT3. β-actin served as an internal
  control; (b) the relative levels of protein compared with β-actin after treatment.
  Data presented as mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant;
  analysis of variance.'
