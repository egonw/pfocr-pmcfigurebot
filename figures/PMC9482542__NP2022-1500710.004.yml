caption: 'Hippocampal PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, and GSK-3β protein expression in various groups
  of mice. (a) PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, and GSK-3β Western blot images. (b–e) PI3K, p-Akt,
  Akt, and GSK-3β expression levels in each group of mice. β-Actin was used as an
  internal reference protein, and the data are mean ± SD (n = 8/group). ∗P < 0.05
  and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. group C; #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. group M.'
