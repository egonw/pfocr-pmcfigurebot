caption: HA-HMMR axis activates AKT signaling. A Immunoblot analyses the expression
  of critical genes of AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway (p-AKT, AKT, p-FOXO1, FOXO1, BAX,
  BAD) in indicated groups. GAPDH was used as a loading control. B Luciferase reporter
  assay showed the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 in control and HMMR-silencing
  AGS cells. C The immunofluorescence (IF) staining of FOXO1 was performed in indicated
  groups. D Immunoblot analysis of HMMR, HAS1, p-AKT, AKT, p-FOXO1 and FOXO1 in patients
  with or without peritoneum metastasis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. E Immunoblot
  analysis of HMMR, HAS1 and critical genes of AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway (p-AKT,
  AKT, p-FOXO1, FOXO1, BAX, BAD) were performed in indicated groups. F Luciferase
  reporter assay showed the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 in indicated groups.
  G The immunofluorescence (IF) staining of FOXO1 was performed in indicated groups.
  H Quantification of cell aggregates formation for the indicated groups. I Quantification
  of anoikis cells in the indicated groups. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
