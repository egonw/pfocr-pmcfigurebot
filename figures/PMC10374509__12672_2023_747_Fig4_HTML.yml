caption: 'Arte delays cellular aging by inhibiting the mTOR pathway in HIEC and BALB/c
  mouse models. a HIEC treated with 5-FU (1.0 μM) or 5-FU plus Arte (4 µM) on Days
  1 and 3; Representative images of immunoblotting of t-mTOR, p-mTOR, t-AMPK, p-AMPK,
  and GAPDH; (b, c) Quantification of relative protein levels (n = 6); d Representative
  images from t-mTOR, p-mTOR and GAPDH Western blot assays; e Quantification of relative
  protein levels, n = 6; (f, g) SA-β-Gal positive representative images and statistical
  charts of HIEC after different concentration of drug treatment with HIEC, scale
  bar: 50 μm; (h, i) The t-mTOR, p-mTOR protein expression in mice with 5-FU-induced
  diarrhea; Protein samples were taken from colonic tissue of 6 mice in each group
  and Western blot analyses were performed (n = 6); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  compared to the control group (CTL); #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compared
  to the vehicle control or the indicated sample. 1D-day one; 3D-day three'
