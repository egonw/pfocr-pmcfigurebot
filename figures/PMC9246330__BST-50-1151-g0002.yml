figure_title: Crosstalk between the circadian clock and heat stress-responsive pathways
caption: The diagram of circadian oscillation (top) was adapted from []. The colors
  of the clock components represent their expression level in response to elevated
  temperatures from Grinevich et al. [], and Blair et al. []. Increased expression
  is shown in orange and decreased expression in light blue. The heat stress-responsive
  pathway (bottom) was adapted from []. The diagram includes only HSFs with known
  variation in basal expression between times of day in Grinevich et al. []. Colors
  indicate whether HSFs are targeted by the clock proteins based on the ChIP-Seq data
  []. Direct targets of circadian components are shown in dark pink, and light purple
  means they are not the direct targets. For both sections, the shapes of the text
  box represent their expression peaks under normal temperature. Ovals, trapezoids,
  and parallelogram mean high expression in the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively.
  Rectangles mean no difference in expression between dawn and dusk. Solid lines indicate
  that the regulation occurs via transcriptional activation or repression. Dashed
  lines indicate regulation via post-translational modification. Thin dotted lines
  represent the regulation through a chaperone function. Thick dotted lines indicate
  that the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
