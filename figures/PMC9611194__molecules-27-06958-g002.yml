caption: Functional analysis of differential genes. (A) Scatter plots of differentially
  expressed genes. There were 737 up-regulated genes and 1027 down-regulated genes
  in the LM group. Abscissa is the difference multiple (logarithmic transformation
  based on 2); (B) The gene ontology annotation analysis between DAGs and classification
  of BP, MF, and CC; (C) The KEGG pathway analysis of related DAGs; (D) The GSEA results
  of differentially abundant genes.
