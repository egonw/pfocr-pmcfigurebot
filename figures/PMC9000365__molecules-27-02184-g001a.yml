caption: 'Adenosine activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human dermal papilla
  cells. Cells were treated with adenosine for different times (0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60,
  120, and 240 min). (a) Whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting to determine
  the levels of β-catenin, pS9-Gsk3β, and Gsk3β. As an internal control, GAPDH was
  used. (b) The expression level of β-catenin, normalized with GAPDH, and the ratio
  of phosphorylated Gsk3β (Ser9) to total Gsk3β protein were evaluated. Wnt3a (100
  ng/mL) was used as a positive control. (c) The mRNA expression profiles of ADORA1,
  ADORA2A, ADORA2B, and ADORA3 were examined in cultured human dermal papilla cells
  and HEK293A reporter cells. The data represent the means of six independent samples.
  Significantly different compared with 0 min treatment samples (β-Catenin * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; ratio of pS9-Gsk3β/total Gsk3β (p-Gsk3β/t-Gsk3 β) #
  p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001).'
