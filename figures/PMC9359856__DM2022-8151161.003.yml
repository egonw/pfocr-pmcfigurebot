caption: 'Relative expression levels of Akt, p-Akt, and p-Akt/Akt. (a) Western blot
  assays for the expressions of Akt and p-Akt. (b) The expressions of Akt in different
  groups. (c and d) The phosphorylation level of Akt in the mimic miRNA-29a-3p group
  was distinctly increased, while in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p group, the phosphorylation
  level of Akt was significantly decreased, and the trend of the p-Akt/Akt ratio was
  the same (∗∗∗: p < 0.001).'
