figure_title: Ectopic activation of the Wnt-catenin pathway in Ikzf1-cko regulatory
  T cells (Treg)
caption: (a) Expression of B-catenin by wild-type (WT) (left histogram) vs. Ikzf1-cko
  (right histogram) Treg measured by flow cytometry (plot depicts B-catenin mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) from n=3 experiments). (b) IFNg secretion by WT (top panels) vs.
  Ikzf1-cko (bottom panels) Treg activated with (right panels) or without (left panels)
  the Wnt pathway inhibitor PKF. (c) IFNg secretion (measured by ELISA) by Ikzf1-cko
  Treg, but not by conventional T cells, is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by
  PKF (n=3).
