caption: 'The mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance and therapeutic targets in COPD.
  After binding to corticosteroids, the glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα) translocates
  to the cell nucleus where it recruits HDAC2 leading to inhibition of the transcription
  inflammatory genes through the deacetylation of histones, which allow GRα interaction
  with the DNA. Oxidative stress, derived either from cigarette smoke or by activation
  of NOX, induces activation of PI3k/Akt/mTORC pathway that culminates with HDAC2
  phosphorylation and degradation. Additionally, peroxynitrite reacts with tyrosine
  residues in HDAC2 to form nitro-Tyrosine, which also induces HDAC2 degradation.
  Inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ and IL-17, and ROS also promote corticosteroid
  resistance through activation of p38 MAPK and PI3k/Akt/mTORC pathways, through the
  phosphorylation of GRα receptor preventing its translocation to the nucleus. In
  addition, IL-17 augments the expression GRβ that competes with GRα for binding to
  GRE in the DNA acting as a dominant-negative regulator. Pharmacological strategies
  to reverse corticosteroid resistance through reduction of oxidative stress include
  molecules that possess antioxidant capacity (i.e., N-acetylcysteine, carbocisteine,
  erdosteine, aminoguanidine), molecules that inhibit iNOS (reducing peroxynitrite
  formation—aminoguanidine), or molecules that mimic endogenous antioxidants (i.e.,
  Ebselen, a GPx mimetic). Moreover, molecules that inhibit NOX, the main source of
  endogenous ROS (Apocynin) may reverse corticosteroid resistance. Likewise, Nrf2
  activators including bardoxolone methyl or dimethyl fumarate increase the transcription
  of antioxidant genes. Inhibitors of PI3k/Akt/mTORC pathway (IC8714), Rapalogs or
  X-1125 (activator of SHIP), act on the prevention of HDAC2 degradation and enhance
  corticosteroid effects. Jakinibs and p38 inhibitors such as Losmapimod, PH-797804,
  Acumapimod, and RV-568 can improve corticosteroid effectiveness by the reduction
  of GRα phosphorylation increasing its nuclear translocation. In addition, Jakinibs
  reduce GRβ expression through inhibition of inflammatory cytokine cell signaling.
