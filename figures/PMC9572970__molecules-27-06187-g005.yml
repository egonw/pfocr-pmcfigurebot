caption: Metabolic pathways for the synthesis of Asc from Glc along with related pathways.
  Structures of Glc, Asc, and intermediate compounds in the last three processes of
  the Asc-synthesizing pathway are shown. Dotted lines indicate alternate carbon flows
  from Glc that may proceed coordinately with Asc synthesis. Three enzymes, AKR1,
  RGN, and GULO, that are involved in the last three steps of the Asc-synthesizing
  pathway, are depicted. Mutations in the GULO gene during evolution have rendered
  some animals incapable of synthesizing Asc.
