caption: 'Low expression of DDX3 promoted tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. (A)
  Subcutaneous xenograft model mice (left panel) and isolated xenograft tumors (right
  panel) by subcutaneously injecting the same number of DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD SW480
  cells. (B, C) Weight and volume analysis of DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD xenograft tumors.
  (D) Representative H&E staining of the subcutaneous tumor tissue in DDX3-NC group
  and DDX3-KD group (left panel). Comparison of relative cell numbers in the H&E staining
  images between DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD groups (right panel). (E) Representative IHC
  staining of DDX3 and Ki-67 in subcutaneous tumor tissue from DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD
  SW480 cells. (F) Intraperitoneal xenograft model mice (left panel) and isolated
  livers (right panel) by intraperitoneal injection of the same number of DDX3-NC
  and DDX3-KD SW480 cells. (G) Representative pictures of ascites extraction and laparotomy
  of DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD mice with intraperitoneal xenograft tumors. (H) Volume analysis
  of bloody ascites extracted from intraperitoneal xenograft model mice in DDX3-NC
  and DDX3-KD groups. (I) Representative images of metastatic liver tissue and its
  H&E staining in DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD groups. The areas indicated by the red triangle
  and surrounded by the yellow triangle are metastatic CRC cells in liver tissue.
  (J) Representative IHC staining of p-Erk1/2 and E-cadherin in subcutaneous tumor
  tissue from DDX3-NC and DDX3-KD SW480 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 via Student''s
  t-test. Abbreviation: CRC, colorectal cancer; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; IHC, immunohistochemistry;
  KD, knockdown; NC, negative control.'
