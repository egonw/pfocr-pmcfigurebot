figure_title: Phylogenetic context of tomato GAME36 proteins
caption: a GAME36 genotype variants obtained from cultivated and wild tomato species.
  ‘+’ (plus) sign indicates presence of genotype (e.g. coding sequence and/or full-length
  protein) in a particular tomato species. Red square with ‘-’ (negative) sign marks
  the absence of full-length GAME36 proteins in the S. huaylasense LA1983 and S. peruvianum
  LA1278 accessions. The predicted GAME36 genotypes were further confirmed and compared
  by Sanger sequencing of cloned GAME36 sequences from respective wild tomato species.
  b, c LC-MS based profiling of acetoxytomatine (b) and hydroxytomatine (c) in leaves
  of cultivated and wild tomato accessions. The values indicate means of biological
  replicates ± standard error mean (n = 3), obtained from three independently grown
  tomato accession plants. Source data (panel b and c) are provided as a Source Data
  file.
