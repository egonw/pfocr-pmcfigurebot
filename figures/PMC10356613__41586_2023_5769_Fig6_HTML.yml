caption: a,b, The ligand–receptor signalling strength between TAL states and IMM subclasses
  (a) or STR subclasses (b). The coloured bars indicate the total signalling strength
  of the cell group by summarizing signalling pathways. The grey bars indicate the
  total signalling strength of a signalling pathway by summarizing cell groups. Members
  of key signaling pathways described in the main text are in bold. c, The average
  gene expression values for select ligand–receptor combinations using snCv3/scCv3
  integrated data. d, Dot plots validating select markers shown in c in the Visium
  data. e, Unadjusted Kaplan–Meier curves by cell state scores for composite of end-stage
  renal disease (ESRD) or for 40% drop in eGFR from time of biopsy in the NEPTUNE
  adult patient cohort (199 patients; Supplementary Table ). Patients who reached
  the end point between screening and biopsy were excluded. Enrich., enrichment. P
  values calculated using log-rank tests for trend are shown (P = 0.021 (aPT), P = 0.003
  (aTAL), P = 0.55 (degenerative)).
