caption: An overview of mammalian second messenger cAMP signaling pathways []. Upstream
  stimulation of Gαs-coupled GPCRs, which then activate AC to create cAMP, is required
  for signaling through the PKA pathway. The activation of Gαi-coupled GPCRs inhibits
  the synthesis of AC and cAMP. Ca2+ and HCO3− activate soluble AC (sAC), which leads
  to cAMP synthesis. The generation of cAMP in the cell is regulated by multiple ACs
  as well as its breakdown by PDEs. The tetrameric PKA holoenzyme is made up of two
  R subunits and two C subunits. Regulatory subunits and substrates are coordinated
  by AKAPs. Additional binding domains on AKAPs aid in the building of protein complexes
  and allow them to be targeted to specific sites inside the cell. When cAMP binds
  to regulatory subunits, the holoenzyme dissociates, allowing catalytic subunits
  to phosphorylate substrates. CREB-mediated transcription is mediated by PKA. A hormone
  binds to Gαs-linked GPCRs on the cell surface, stimulating cAMP synthesis and PKA
  activation through adenylyl cyclase signaling. Adenylyl cyclase and cAMP generation
  are inhibited when Gαi-coupled GPCRs are activated. C subunits translocate to the
  nucleus to phosphorylate CREB on serine 133 when they are active. To enhance binding
  to CREs and transcription of target genes, phosphorylated CREB binds coactivators
  such as CBP. CREB-mediated transcription is regulated by other coactivators such
  as CRTCs. Phosphorylation of CRTCs by other kinases causes them to be sequestered
  in the cytoplasm, while dephosphorylation by phosphatase allows them to be translocated
  to the nucleus. Beyond PKA, cAMP binds to and activates effectors. cAMP modulates
  channel opening and cation currents through binding to CNG ion channels. HCN channels
  bind cAMP to help membrane hyperpolarization open the channel. In the Ras-associated
  protein (RAP) family of small GTPases, cAMP binds to EPAC to enable the exchange
  of GDP for GTP. POPDC proteins exist as dimers on the cell surface that bind cAMP.
