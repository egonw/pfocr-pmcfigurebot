caption: DPSC℗ reduces nuclear translocation of NFkB and induces phosphorylation of
  SMAD2 and SMAD3. (A) Immunofluorescence images are shown for nuclear translocation
  of NFkB in primary fibroblast cells in the presence or absence of various doses
  of DPSC in the inflammatory state induced by TNF-α. (B) Western blot images of phosphorylation
  of various signaling pathway molecules are presented, keeping GAPDH as an internal
  control.
