caption: TKI-activated NFKB2 (P100/P52) pathway and siRNA knockdown of NFKB2 in vitro.
  (A) Data show mRNA expressions of canonical (NFKB1) and non-canonical (NFKB2) pathways
  after 80 nM GILT or 80 nM QUIZ treatment; (B) 2 days after the siRNA-NFKB2 treatment
  (50 nM) with or without 80 nM GILT in vitro, the cells were collected for RNA isolation
  and gene expressions were analyzed by qPCR. Data show mRNA expressions of NFKB2;
  (N = 3) (Câ€“E) Data show mRNA expressions of MIF, CXCR2 and CXCL5 genes after transiently
  knocking down NFKB2 in MV4-11; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
