caption: Sophoridine is involved in cell cycle arrest through different pathways.
  (1) Downregulation of Cyclin D1 protein expression in G0/G1 phase induces cell cycle
  arrest; (2) Inhibition of PTEN/AKT signal pathway in G1/S phase; (3) Inhibition
  of ERK/JNK signal pathway; (4) Inhibition of ESRRG/β-catenin signal pathway and
  downregulation of CDK2 protein expression.
