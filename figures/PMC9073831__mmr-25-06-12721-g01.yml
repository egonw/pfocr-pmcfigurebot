caption: Knockdown of NUSAP1 inhibits metastatic potential of nephroblastoma cells.
  (A) Wound healing assay was performed to detect cell migration. (B) Transwell assay
  was performed to detect cell invasion. Magnification, Ã—200. (C) Western blotting
  was conducted to detect the expression of metastasis-related proteins. ***P<0.001
  vs. shRNA-NC. NUSAP1, nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1; shRNA, short hairpin
  RNA; NC, negative control.
article_title: Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation,
  invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
