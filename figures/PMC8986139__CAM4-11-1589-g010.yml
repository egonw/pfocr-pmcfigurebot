caption: FOXK1 is regulated by the RNASEH1‐AS1/miR‐516a‐5p axis. (A) The wt and mut
  sequences between miR‐516a‐5p and FOXK1 are shown. (B) FOXK1 level in NSCLC. (C)
  The expression relationship between miR‐516a‐5p and FOXK1 in NSCLC tissues. (D)
  The luciferase activity of NSCLC cells after cotransfection with FOXK1‐wt or FOXK1‐mut
  and the miR‐516a‐5p mimic or NC mimic was detected. (E, F) FOXK1 expression was
  measured in miR‐516a‐5p‐overexpressing NSCLC cells. (G, H) RNASEH1‐AS1‐knockdown
  or RNASEH1‐AS1‐overexpressing NSCLC cells were subjected to the assessment of FOXK1
  expression. (I) The expression relationship between FOXK1 and RNASEH1‐AS1 in NSCLC
  tissues. (J) RIP experiment verified the interaction among RNASEH1‐AS1, miR‐516a‐5p,
  and FOXK1. (K, L) si‐RNASEH1‐AS1‐transfected or pc‐RNASEH1‐AS1‐transfected NSCLC
  cells were treated with the miR‐516a‐5p inhibitor or the miR‐516a‐5p mimic. Then,
  FOXK1 expression was examined in the different groups. **p<0.01
article_title: Long noncoding RNASEH1‐AS1 exacerbates the progression of non‐small
  cell lung cancer by acting as a ceRNA to regulate microRNA‐516a‐5p/FOXK1 and thereby
  activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
