caption: Metabolic pathway map summarizing the results. In light blue, the metabolite
  whose concentration is reduced in diabetes samples; and in red, the metabolites
  whose concentration is increased in the diabetes samples (compared with values in
  samples from healthy controls). Molecules whose concentration was not determined
  are within ellipses; they are included as nodes in metabolism interconnections.
  Areas in color represent the main metabolic pathways. The mitochondria symbol indicates
  a molecule/group of molecules that may be in mitochondria or are directly/indirectly
  related to mitochondria.
