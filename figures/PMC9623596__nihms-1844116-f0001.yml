caption: Using Pavlovian fear conditioning to study memory. (a) An initially motivationally
  neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), such as a tone, is paired with an aversive unconditioned
  stimulus (US), such as a foot shock. The US elicits an unconditioned response (UCR),
  an activity burst. Upon subsequent presentation of the tone CS in a novel context,
  rodents exhibit a conditioned response (CR), such as freezing. (b) Circuit diagram
  depicting converging sensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA)
  critical for auditory fear conditioning. Auditory information (CS pathway) travels
  from the auditory thalamus [medial geniculate nucleus, medial portion (MGm) and
  adjacent posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN)], as well as from secondary auditory
  cortical regions (ACx), to the LA (see , ). Information about the foot shock (US
  pathway) is relayed to the LA through the somatosensory thalamic nuclei (including
  the PIN) (see , , , ).
