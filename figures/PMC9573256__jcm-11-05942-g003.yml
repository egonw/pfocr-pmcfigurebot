caption: Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) matched with
  Funrich data base. (A,C,E,G) indicate altered process 4 h after treatment with 100
  nM asprosin; (B,D,F,H) show processes associated with DEGs 12 h after treatment.
  (A,B) Biological process; (C,D) Molecular function; (E,F) Biological Pathway; (G,H)
  Site of expression. Significant data sets identified using hypo geometric test are
  indicated by * p < 0.05.
