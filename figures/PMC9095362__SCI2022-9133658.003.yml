caption: CSC-Exos are involved in cancer metastasis and infiltration. Exosomes derived
  from renal clear carcinoma (RCC) stem cells carry miR-19b-3p, which inhibits the
  expression of PTEN in the cell and mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  to promote cancer metastasis. Melanoma cell-derived exosomes carry let-7a and miR-191,
  which activate MAPK signaling to mediate EMT to promote metastasis. miR-140-3p in
  exosomes secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells can inhibit MAPK/ERK pathway
  activity and increase the expression of vimentin and N-cadherin to induce EMT and
  tumor metastasis. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell-derived exosomes facilitate
  metastasis by regulating adhesion of circulating tumor cells and inducing reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production via SMAD3 signaling in liver cancer. Exosomes secreted
  by prostate cancer (PC) cells contain miR-940, which acts on ARHGAP1 and FAM134A
  in osteoblasts to promote the formation of a bone metastatic microenvironment.
