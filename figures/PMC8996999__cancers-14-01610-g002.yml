caption: The PI3K-AKT and related pathways in thyroid cancer. Extracellular signals
  activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), leading to the activation of RAS and
  PI3K. Activated PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1; also known as PDPK1), which consequently associates with
  AKT and leads to phosphorylation (P) and the activation of AKT by PDK1. Phosphorylated
  AKT enters the nucleus, where it induces tumor-promoting genes. In the cytoplasm,
  phospho-AKT also activates other signaling molecules or pathways, including the
  mTOR pathway, which has an important role in tumorigenesis. Phospho-AKT can also
  directly phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), relieving the GSK3β-mediated
  suppression of β-catenin. Consequently, β-catenin can enter the nucleus, where it
  promotes the expression of tumor-promoting genes. In the nucleus, phospho-AKT can
  phosphorylate forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) on its AKT-specific motif. This phosphorylated
  FOXO3 is translocated out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it binds 14-3-3
  proteins to be sequestered in the cytoplasm, thus terminating the pro-apoptotic
  activities of the FOXO3 pathway. The downward arrow for the FOXO activities in the
  nucleus in the figure indicates this negative effect of AKT on pro-apoptotic genes
  in the FOXO pathway, which would otherwise be upregulated by the FOXO3 pathway.
  The major negative regulatory mechanism of the PI3K–AKT pathway is PTEN, which is
  a phosphatase that converts PIP3 to PIP2, thus terminating the activation of the
  pathway. The inset shows the self-enhancement mechanism of PI3K–AKT signaling, resulting
  in a loss of termination of the signaling. Figure reprinted from Ref. [], by permission.
