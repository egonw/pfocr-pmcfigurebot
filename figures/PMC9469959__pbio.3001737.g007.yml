figure_title: Vimentin regulates mTORC1 signaling by facilitating mTORC1 localization
  to lysosomes
caption: 'A simplified scheme of the mTORC1 signaling system. Our results demonstrate
  that in the presence of nutrients, vimentin facilitates mTORC1 activation by regulating
  Rag GTPase activation. This results in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and P70S6K downstream
  targets, which lead to protein synthesis. Moreover, activation of mTORC1 results
  in decreased autophagy, as demonstrated by higher levels of the autophagic flux
  indicator p62 and reduced LC3I conversion to LC3II. As this autophagy inhibition
  works even under nutrient-starved condition, in the absence of AKT activation, the
  results imply that vimentin inhibits autophagy by mTORC1-mediated inhibition of
  ULK1-Beclin pathway. In this way, vimentin promotes cell size in 2 directions: by
  boosting protein synthesis through mTORC1 activation and by inhibiting of protein
  degradation through inhibition of autophagic flux. mTORC1, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin kinase complex 1.'
