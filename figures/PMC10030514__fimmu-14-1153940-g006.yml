caption: Screen the top 10 robust different expression genes for prediction through
  transcriptome and protein interactions. (A) The ROC curve and AUC show the performance
  of a classification model at thresholds in all rejection samples of monocytes. (B)
  The protein-protein interactions network shows the 10 hub genes with high connectivity
  in monocytes after feature selection by LASSO regression. (C) The metabolic pathway
  enriches by GO. (D) The network of enriched clusters represents the most significant
  term of biological process and metabolic pathway. (E) The boxplots show the expression
  of the hub genes in the deconvoluted gene expressions. ROC curve, receiver operating
  characteristic curve; AUC, area under the ROC curve. *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01.
