caption: miR-139-5p negatively regulated the expression of the target gene CTBP1.
  A Correlation analysis of CTBP1 and miRNA-139-5p. B, C A dual luciferase reporter
  assay was conducted to determine the relative luciferase activities following the
  indicated transfections in H293T and MIA Paca-2 cells. D, E CTBP1 was downregulated
  following miRNA-139-5p overexpression in BxPC-3 and MIA Paca-2 cells and overexpressed
  following silencing of miRNA-139-5p in PANC-1 cells. F–H CTBP1 protein expression
  was detected following the indicated transfections in BxPC-3, MIA Paca-2, and PANC-1
  cells. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
