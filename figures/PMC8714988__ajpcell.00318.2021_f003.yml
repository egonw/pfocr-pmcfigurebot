caption: 'IPA canonical pathways for the MBT; entries were limited to those present
  in at least three datasets in the full analysis. Figure consists of two wrapped
  columns for the full and homology methods. Along the top x-axis, each column is
  further divided by dataset, 4&5* DEGs shared by at least four species and the whole
  species DEG lists for human, rhesus, mouse, cow, and pig. Along the y-axis are the
  identified canonical pathways. Level of significant overlap was set at P < 0.05;
  entries with white color denote those not meeting significance. Color denotes z
  score and predicted activity: red = activated, blue = inhibited, black = nonsignificant
  z score. Data generated from Supplemental Table S13. DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; MBT, morula to blasotcyst transition.'

  transition: metabolic and physiological changes take center stage.'
