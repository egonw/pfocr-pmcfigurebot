caption: 'The Notch signaling pathway was upregulated after hepatocellular carcinoma
  induction, and the inhibition of Notch signaling suppressed hepatocyte dedifferentiation.
  (A) WISH results showed the expression pattern of notch1a, notch1b, notch2, notch3,
  and her15 at 10 dpf after DOX activation of krasG12V. (B) Tg(fabp10a:Tet3G;TRE3G:krasG12V-ZsGreen1)
  with Tg(Hsp70l:dnMAML-GFP) double transgenic fish line treatment strategy. (C) Monolayer
  images of Anxa4 antibody staining showed expression changes in the DOX-induced krasG12V+
  and krasG12V+ and dnMAML+ groups at 8 dpf and 10 dpf. (D) Statistics of Anxa4 +
  and ZsGreen1 + /ZsGreen1+ ratio in the DOX-induced krasG12V+ (n = 11) and krasG12V+
  and dnMAML+ (n = 13) groups at 8 dpf and 10 dpf. (E) The results of fluorescent
  in situ hybridization (FISH) showed sox9b expression in the DOX-induced control
  and krasG12V+ and krasG12V+ and dnMAML+ groups at 10 dpf. (F) The results of FISH
  showed cp expression in the DOX-induced control, krasG12V+ and krasG12V+ and dnMAML+
  groups at 10 dpf. Numbers indicate the proportion of larvae exhibiting that expression.
  Asterisks show significance: ****—p < 0.0001. Scale bars—100 μm; error bars—S.D.'
