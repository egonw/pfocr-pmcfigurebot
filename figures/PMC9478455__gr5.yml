caption: PACAP activates the FAIM-AMPK-IRβ axis to govern the SREBP and lipid synthetic
  gene program. (A and B) PACAP activated AMPK-IRβ signaling pathway and down-regulated
  the expression of lipogenesis genes in HFD-fed mice, such effects were suppressed
  following knockdown of Faim. Western blot analysis were used to detect the protein
  level of indicated antibodies. (C and D) The overexpression of FAIM activated AMPK-IRβ
  signaling pathway, the protein levels of FAIM, p-AMPK, AMPK, p-IRβ, IRβ, and lipid
  synthesis genes SREBP1, SREBP2, FAS, SCD1, HMGCR were determined by western blot
  with quantifications. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, n = 3 (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001).
