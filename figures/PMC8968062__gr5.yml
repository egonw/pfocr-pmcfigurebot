caption: cGAS-STING pathway promotes tumor metastasis. (A) H&E staining of lung tissues
  from the tumor-bearing mice. The mice were injected with NC, cGAS- and STING-knockout
  HeLa cells through the tail vein. n = 5 for each group. (B) Weight of lung tissues
  and mice from NC and knockout group. n = 5 for each group. (C) Survival rate of
  mice injected with NC, cGAS- or STING-depleted HeLa cells. n = 5 for each group.
  (D, E) Transwell assay of NC and knockout groups of HeLa cells (D) and PANC-1 cells
  (E). The bottom panels are quantitative results of migration and invasion. (F, G)
  Western blot analysis of the expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin in the indicated
  HeLa (F) and PANC-1 cells (G). The quantification of the band intensity of Western
  blot was provided in the Supplementary Table S5. Data were represented as mean ±
  SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. n.s, no significant difference.
