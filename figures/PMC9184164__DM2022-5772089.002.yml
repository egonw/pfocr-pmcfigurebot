caption: After knockdown of ATF-2, the effects of ATF-2 expression on the Wnt/Ca2+signaling
  pathway and NSCLC proliferation and invasion were detected. (a) After ATF-2 knockdown,
  the expression of ATF-2 was detected by WB, and the knockdown efficiency was detected.
  (b, c) The activity of the Wnt pathway was detected by qPCR and WB. (d) CCK8 was
  used to detect cell proliferation. (e) Transwell tested the invasion ability of
  cells. Compared to the control group, âˆ—P < 0.05, the difference was statistically
  significant.
