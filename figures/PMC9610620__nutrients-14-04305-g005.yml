caption: 'The metabolic pathways significantly matched with the discriminatory metabolites:
  (A) for meal–dependent metabolites that changed postprandially, discriminating people
  with overweight/obesity from lean individuals after a HC meal; (B) for metabolites
  significantly changing in the cinnamon/capsicum intervention study. The pathway
  impact value (x-axis) was obtained from pathway topological analysis, while the
  log(10) of the p-value (y-axis) was obtained from pathway enrichment analysis. The
  most significant pathways are characterized by a high −log10(p) value and the pathway
  impact value.'
