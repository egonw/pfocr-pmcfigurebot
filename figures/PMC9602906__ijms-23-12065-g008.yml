caption: The mechanism of ADSCs-Exo alleviates pyroptosis and promotes tissue regeneration
  in the liver, which had ischemia–reperfusion and partial resection injury. The results
  show that ADSCs-Exo inhibits the NF-κB pathway and activates the Wnt/β-catenin signal
  pathway. The mechanism may be like that in . Liver injury leads to an inflammatory
  response that will restrain hepatocyte proliferation if it is too serious. After
  transplanting ADSCs-Exo, the phosphorylation of NF-κB is inhibited and fails to
  stimulate the production of inflammation and the activation of GSDMD. On the other
  hand, ADSCs-Exo can activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and β-catenin translocates
  into the nucleus, increasing the expression of Cyclin D1 and thereby promoting cell
  proliferation. Ultimately, ADSCs-Exo play a role in mitigating cell damage and promoting
  tissue regeneration and functional recovery.
