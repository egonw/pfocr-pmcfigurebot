caption: 'iPSCs had no effect on proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts under hypoxic damage.
  A Immunofluorescence staining showing EdU+ cells in C2C12 myoblasts after exposure
  to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h with or without iPSCs co-culture. (red, EdU; blue,
  Hoechst33342). B The percentage of EdU+ cells in C2C12 myoblasts. C The flow chart
  of C2C12 DNA content. D The percentage of C2C12 myoblasts in each part of the cell
  cycle in after exposure to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h with or without iPSCs co-culture.
  E Results of qPCR analysis showing that the mRNA levels of Ccna2, Ccnb1, and Ccne1
  had no effect on C2C12 myoblasts after exposure to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h
  with or without iPSCs co-culture. Statistics were from three independent replicates
  of the samples and data were expressed as mean ± SEM; the remaining two groups were
  compared with the hypoxic group, respectively, and P values are the results of one-way
  ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ns, no significant difference. Scale
  bar = 100 μm. Co: iPSCs and C2C12 co-culture. EdU: 5-Ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine'
