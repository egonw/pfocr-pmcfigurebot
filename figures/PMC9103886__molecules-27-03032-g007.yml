caption: Detection of DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. (A) untreated
  cells; (0 μ M), positive control HepG2. (B) cells were exposed to n-3 PUFAs at half
  IC50 concentration (450 μM) for 48 h; (C) DNA fragmentation at IC50 (900 μM). Three
  experiments were performed with similar results.
