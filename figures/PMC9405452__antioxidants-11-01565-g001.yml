caption: 'The main stages of atherogenic damage of the vascular wall during oxidative
  and carbonyl stress in atherogenesis and diabetogenesis and the development of endothelial
  dysfunction under the action of dicarbonyl-modified LDL (based on literature and
  own data). Red lines and rectangles highlight the metabolic reactions and processes
  whose existence was experimentally confirmed by the authors of this review. Numbers
  denote: 1. Pathways of secondary development of oxidative stress in diabetes associated
  with increased free-radical mechanism of endotheliocyte membrane damage and development
  of endothelial dysfunction lipoperoxidation in atherogenesis [,]; 2. An alternative
  pathway of oxidative stress development in diabetes associated with the formation
  of superoxide anion radical and other ROS during the reaction of amino-containing
  compounds with methylglyoxal (Maillard reaction) []; 3. Non-enzymatic formation
  of methylglyoxal when glucose derivatives are attacked by alkoxyl lipid radicals
  []; 4. Chemical modification of LDL, involving various natural dicarbonyls: MDA,
  glyoxal, and methylglyoxal [,,,]; 5. Foam cell formation and preaterosclerotic (lipoidosis)
  damage of the vascular wall under the action of dicarbonyl-modified LDL []; 6. Expression
  of LOX-1 on endotheliocyte membranes under the action of dicarbonyl-modified LDL
  []; 7. Expression of NADPH-oxidase in endotheliocytes during the accumulation of
  dicarbonyl-modified LDL and under generation of superoxide anion radical by this
  enzyme system []; 8. Stimulation of endotheliocyte apoptosis by superoxide anion
  radical and other ROS generated by NADPH-oxidase [,,,]; 9. Glycocalyx degradation
  under the action of superoxide anion radical and other ROS [,,,,]; 10. Free-radical
  mechanism of endotheliocyte membrane damage and development of endothelial dysfunction
  [,,,,].'
