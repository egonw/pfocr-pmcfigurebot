caption: Hedgehog pathway inhibition alters cell proliferation and cell death in human
  fetal lung explants. (A–D) IF staining of human fetal lung explants treated with
  5E1 for 48 h (B) or untreated (A) using KI67 (red) and CDH1 (as epithelial marker
  in green) to assess cell proliferation. Quantification of total cell proliferation
  (C), epithelial proliferation (D), and mesenchymal proliferation (E). Results are
  shown as mean ± SEM, n = 8 for each group. (F,G) Cleaved-caspase-3 IF staining of
  human fetal lungs treated (G) or not (F) with 5E1 to assess cell death (G vs. F;
  n = 4), Cleaved-caspase-3 is in green; and CDH1 in red. Quantification of total
  number of Cleaved-caspase-3+ cells (H), Cleaved-caspase3+ cells in the epithelium
  (I), and Cleaved-caspase-3+ cells in the mesenchyme (J). Results are shown mean
  ± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001; ns = no stress.
