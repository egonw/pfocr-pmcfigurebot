caption: Designing a pathway for S-3HB biosynthesis in M. maripaludis. (A) The phaA-hbd-tesB
  pathway is composed of three enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of S-3HB from acetyl-CoA.
  Expression of each gene is driven by the PmcrB promoter from Methanosarcina barkeri.
  (phaA, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase/synthase from Ralstonia eutropha; hbd, 3S-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum; tesB, acyl-coA thioesterase from
  Escherichia coli). All constructs were targeted to the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (hpt) site via homologous recombination. (B) Enzymatic activity of the S-3HB pathway
  enzymes was determined in M. maripaludis crude lysates supplemented with appropriate
  substrates and cofactors. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t test.
  All data are reported as mean ± SD (n = 3).
