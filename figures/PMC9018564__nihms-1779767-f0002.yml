figure_title: Wnt signature derived by integrative analysis of VCaP cells and clinical
  datasets predicts Wnt activities
caption: 'A, Fold change of 47-geneset between Wnt-high versus Wnt-low status in clinical
  datasets and VCaP with APC knockdown (APCi) and WNT3a/RNF43 knockdown. Patients
  were stratified into Wnt-high (WH, top 10% Wnt activity score based on 124 gene
  set) and Wnt-low (WL, bottom 10% of the Wnt activity score) within TCGA (WH, n=55
  vs WL, n=105), SU2C (WH, n=14 vs WL, n=14), WCPCDT (WH, n=14 vs WL, n=11) and FHCRC
  (WH, n=28 vs WL, n=16) datasets. B, C, GO biological processes or Pathway enrichment
  for 47-geneset with P value <0.01. D, Upstream prediction analysis. E-I, Scatter
  plots, with lines at median and interquartile ranges, show Wnt activity score distributions
  in cases with or without APC/CTNNB1 alterations in the following clinical datasets
  and one PDX dataset: E, TCGA (Rest, n=449; APC, n=10; CTNNB1, n=15); F, SU2C (Rest,
  n=118; APC, n=9, CTNNB1, n=4); G, WCPCDT (Rest, n=141; APC, n=3; CTNNB1, n=5); H,
  FHCRC (Rest, n=141; APC, n=3; CTNNB1, n=5); I, LuCaP PDX series (Rest, n=34; APC-deleterious
  stands for APC loss/truncation mutations, n=10; APC-nonsym is nonsynonymous mutations
  of unclear functional significance, n=4). Mann-Whitney tests, cutoff p<0.05. ****
  = p<0.0001, *** = p<0.001, ** = p<0.01, * = p<0.05, ns = no significance.'
