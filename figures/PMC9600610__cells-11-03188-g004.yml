caption: 'PFN1-Cdc42 negatively regulates bovine skeletal muscle via PAK/JNK signaling
  pathway: (A) Western blot testing and quantitative analysis of the effect of Cdc42
  on PAK phosphorylation in si-Cdc42 or si-NC transfected DM2 myoblasts; (B) Western
  blot testing and quantitative analysis of the effect of Cdc42 on PAK phosphorylation
  in pcDNA-Cdc42 or pcDNA3.1(+) transfected DM2 myoblasts; (C) changes analysis of
  differentiation marker proteins of the DM2 bovine myoblasts with P-PAK inhibitor
  by Western blot; (D) protein level analysis of P-JNK after P-PAK inhibition in DM2
  bovine myoblasts by Western blot; (E) Western blot detecting and quantitative analysis
  of the effect of PFN1 on the JNK signal pathway in si-PFN1 or si-NC transfected
  DM2 myoblasts; (F) Western blot detecting and quantitative analysis of the effect
  of PFN1 on the JNK signal pathway in pcDNA-PFN1 or pcDNA3.1(+) transfected DM2 myoblasts;
  (G) Western blot detecting and quantitative analysis of the effect of Cdc42 on the
  JNK signal pathway in si-Cdc42 or si-NC transfected DM2 myoblasts; (H) the effect
  analysis of Cdc42 on the JNK signal pathway in pcDNA-Cdc42 or pcDNA3.1(+) transfected
  DM2 myoblasts; (I) change analysis of differentiation marker proteins of the DM2
  bovine myoblasts with JNK inhibitor. si-NC stands for negative control, and pcDNA3.1(+)
  stands for empty vector control negative control. N.S.: non significance, * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01.'
