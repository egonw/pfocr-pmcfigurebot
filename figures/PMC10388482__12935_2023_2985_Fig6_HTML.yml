caption: Thalidomide decreases SALL4 expression and inhibits angiogenesis. A SALL4-B,
  VEGF-A, B, and C expression levels were measured in MGC-803 cells treated with different
  concentrations of Thalidomide by using real-time qRT-PCR. B SALL4-B, VEGF-A, B,
  and C protein expression levels were determined by using western blots in MGC-803
  cells treated with different concentrations of Thalidomide. C ELISA assay was used
  to measure VEGF-A, B, and C expression levels in a conditioned medium (CM) from
  MGC-803 cells. D CCK-8 assay was used to assess HUVEC cell proliferation after treatment
  with CM from MGC-803 cells. E Transwell assay was used to examine the effects of
  CM from MGC-803 cells on the migration of HUVEC cells. F Tube formation of HUVECs
  after treatment with CM from MGC-803 cells. The results are presented as the means ± standard
  error of mean (SEM) **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
