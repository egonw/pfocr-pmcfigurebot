figure_title: The effect of CerS6 on CD3 and PKCθ capping in CD4 T cells after TCR
  stimulation
caption: Primary CD4 T cells (1×106 cells) were engaged with TCR for the indicated
  time points followed by their incubation with anti-CD3 antibody for 30 minutes at
  4°C. After PBS wash and incubation with goat anti-hamster IgG at 37°C, the reaction
  was stopped immediately, and the cells were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor
  488-conjugated antibody for 30 minutes at 4°C. The cells were fixed and permeabilized
  followed by incubation overnight at 4°C with PKCθ antibody, and then stained with
  Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody followed by analysis with confocal microscopy
  (original magnification x63). At least 6–7 fields in each condition per experiment
  were examined. The data shown here is one representative of two independent experiments.
