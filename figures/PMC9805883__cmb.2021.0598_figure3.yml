caption: The results of pathway analysis. (A) Clustered heatmap of SHAP value with
  the red color denoting increase and green color denoting decrease. The KEGG pathways
  enriched in each of the 20 clusters are represented with a heatmap. (B) The pathway
  network of cluster J. (C) The pathway network of cluster S. Yellow circles denote
  well-known AD-related genes. AD, Alzheimer's disease; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; SHAP, Shapley additive explanation.
