caption: Structures of type V GPAs and the schematic biosynthetic pathway of complestatin.
  (A) Chemical structures of type V GPAs. Type V GPAs are classified by the presence
  of the conserved central Trp-Hpg-(m)Tyr cross-linked structural motif. Kistamicin
  has an extra A–O–B ring, and corbomycin has two extra B–C and G–O–H ring structures.
  Most GPAs are heptapeptides; however, corbomycin and GP6738 represent the only two
  known nonapeptide GPAs. (B) Complestatin biosynthetic pathway as an example of GPA
  biosynthesis. The core NRPS scaffold genes (comA-comD), MbtH gene (comE), Na+/H+
  antiporter gene (comF), halogenase gene (comH), and P450 monooxygenase genes (comI-comJ)
  are shown. NRPS domains are labeled as A, adenylation; C, condensation; T, thiolation
  or peptidyl carrier protein; E, epimerization; MT, methyltransferase; X, Oxy-recruting
  domain; and TE, thioesterase. The halogenation catalyzed by ComH takes place when
  the amino acid building block is tethered to the T domain. The characteristic ring
  cross-linking reactions are performed by specific Oxy proteins as shown. Numbering
  of the rings on the GPA scaffolds is shown in bold font.
