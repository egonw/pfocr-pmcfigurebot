caption: Related signal pathways of small peptides in drought, salt, temperature,
  and heavy metals stress. The arrow and T-line without arrowheads respectively represent
  positive and negative regulation in the signaling pathway. Solid lines indicate
  direct regulation, while dashed lines indicate the presence of multiple steps or
  unknown components.
