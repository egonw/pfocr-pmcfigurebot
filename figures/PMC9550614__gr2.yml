caption: 'Plpp6−/− mice have decreased serum, DC cholesterol, and macropinocytosis(A)
  Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway; PLPP6 converts PSDP, a biosynthetic intermediate
  for cholesterol, into PSMP upon cell activation.(B) Serum total cholesterol at baseline
  and on day 16 of HDM protocol was measured by colorimetric assay (see ); experiments
  were performed 3 times for a total of n = 7.(C) BMDC free cholesterol content was
  measured by Filipin III staining and analyzed by flow cytometry; experiments were
  performed 3 times for a total of n = 5 to 6.(D) LDLR-mediated cholesterol transport
  was determined using BMDCs exposed to CholEsteryl-BODIPY and analyzed by flow cytometry;
  percentage of CholEsteryl-BODIPY+ BMDCs are shown (see ) (representative flow cytometry
  histograms on the left); experiments were performed 3 times for a total of n = 6.(E)
  BMDC macropinocytosis of dextran (70,000 MW)-TMR was analyzed by flow cytometry;
  percentage of dextran-TMR+ BMDCs (representative flow cytometry histograms on the
  left); experiments were performed 2 times for a total of n = 3 to 4.(F) Representative
  confocal microscopy images of WT and Plpp6−/− BMDCs exposed to dextran-TMR; images
  of DIC, fluorescent and merged channels; scale bars correspond to 10μm.(G) BMDC
  uptake of fluorescent-labeled HDM (HDM-AF647) analyzed by flow cytometry; percentage
  of HDM-AF647+ BMDCs; experiments were performed 2 times for a total of n = 4.(H)
  WT and Plpp6−/− BMDC cholesterol content were experimentally increased using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
  loaded cholesterol (mβCD-chol) (160 μg/mL of cholesterol) (See ) before incubation
  with labeled dextran; percentage of dextran-TMR+ BMDCs were quantitated by FACS
  (representative flow cytometry histograms on the left); experiments were performed
  3 times for a total of n = 4.(I) WT and Plpp6−/− BMDC exposed to mβCD-chol (See
  ) before incubation with labeled HDM; percentage of HDM-AF647+ BMDCs were quantitated
  by FACS; experiments were performed 2 times for a total of n = 4. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.05,
  #p = 0.05 by unpaired nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Bars represent median with
  interquartile range. See also .'
