caption: Effect of silibinin on cell viability of skin fibroblasts. (A) Human dermal
  fibroblast. (B) Keloid-derived fibroblast. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×
  104 cells/well in 96-well plates overnight and then treated with different concentrations
  of silibinin (0–200 µM) at 37 °C for 24 h. Cell viability was analyzed using the
  CCK-8 assay kit. The viability of the cells was not markedly suppressed by treatment
  with silibinin at a concentration of 200 μM. HDF, human dermal fibroblast; KF, keloid-derived
  fibroblast; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.
