caption: 'ST water extract activated AKT and ERK phosphorylation in HL7702 cells.
  Cells were treated with ST water extract at concentrations of 50, 200, 800 μg/mL
  for 72 h. Thereafter, the levels of p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, ERK were evaluated using
  Western blotting. (A) Representative Western blot of p-AKT and AKT. (B) Representative
  Western blot of p-ERK and ERK. (C) Quantitation of p-AKT/AKT. (D) Quantitation of
  p-ERK/ERK. Cells were treated with ST water extract 800 μg/mL with or without AKT
  inhibitor or ERK1/2 inhibitor for 72 h. (E) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
  (F) BrdU content was measured using BrdU ELISA assay. Data were presented as mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. **P < 0.01 vs control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  vs ST water extract (800 μg/mL) alone.'
