caption: (a) KEGG pathway enriched terms of FRC2 upregulation genes. (b) The heat
  map showed the expressions of prognostic FRSig genes, which were screened by univariate
  Cox regression analysis, between two FRC clusters. The LGG samples were annotated
  with the information of age, molecular subtype, and WHO grade. (c) Alluvial diagram
  of FRC clusters in group with distinct WHO grade, FPI level, and FRscore. (d) Spearman
  correlation analysis between FRscore and well-established biological signatures.
  (e, f) Kaplan-Meier curves for low- and high-FRscore LGG subgroups in the TCGA cohort
  showed LGG patients with higher FRscores have shorter OS (e) and PFI (f) time. (g)
  A line chart showed the area under curve (AUC) values of FRscore in the three LGG
  cohorts for predicting the 1–5-year OS. (h) Distribution of FRscore in distinct
  IDH-codeletion subtypes in the TCGA cohort, and the FRscore levels between every
  two molecular subgroups were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The labelled asterisk
  indicated the statistical p value (ns p > 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001).
