caption: ASIC1a reduces the chemosensitivity of HR and BR cells by promoting EMT via
  the AKT/GSK3β/Snail signalling pathway which was driven by TGFβ/Smad signals. (A)
  Western blotting analysis. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3. **p < 0.01
  and ***p < 0.001 versus H or B group. (B) Migration abilities of different group
  cells were examined by wound‐healing assays. Representative images were taken at
  ×100 magnification. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3. ns, no significance,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (C) Invasion abilities of different group cells were determined
  by transwell invasion assays. Representative images were taken at ×200 magnification.
  Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3. **p < 0.01 versus HR(pH6.5) or BR(pH6.5)
  group. (D–G) Western blotting analysis. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 versus HR(pH6.5) or BR(pH6.5) group
