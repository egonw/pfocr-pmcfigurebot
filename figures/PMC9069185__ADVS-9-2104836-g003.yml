caption: 'YY2 negatively regulates tumorigenesis. A) YY2 protein expression level
  in HCT116YY2null cells, as determined using western blotting. B) Cell viability
  of HCT116YY2null cells were measured at indicated time points. Colony formation
  potential of C) HCT116 cells overexpressing YY2 and D) YY2‐knocked out HCT116 cells.
  Representative images and quantification results (n = 6) are shown. E) YY2 expression
  level in clinical colon cancer tissue and the corresponding normal adjacent tissue,
  as analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. Scale bars, 50 μm. Tumorigenesis
  potential of F) YY2‐overexpressed HCT116 and G) YY2‐knocked out HCT116 (HCT116YY2null)
  cells were examined in vivo by subcutaneous injection into Balb/c‐nu/nu mice (n
  = 6). Morphological images of the tumors generated at 28 days after injection (upper
  panels) and volume of the tumors formed at indicated time points (lower panels)
  are shown. H) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis from differentially expressed genes with
  p‐value < 0.05 (representing significantly altered genes; n = 3) in YY2‐overexpressing
  cells was performed using the database for annotation. The enriched GO biological
  processes were identified and listed according to their enrichment scores (−log10
  (p value)). I) KEGGs enrichment from differentially expressed genes with p‐value
  < 0.05 (representing significantly enriched pathway). Wild‐type HCT116, cells transfected
  with pcCon or infected with empty lentivirus (EV) were used as controls. β‐actin
  was used as western blotting loading control. Quantification data are shown as mean
  ± SD (n = 3, unless further indicated). p values were calculated using two‐tailed
  unpaired Student''s t‐test. pcCon: pcDNA3.1(+); YY2KO: HCT116YY2null cells; **p
  < 0.01.'
