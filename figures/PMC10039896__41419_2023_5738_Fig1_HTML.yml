figure_title: Fatostatin induces cell death and inhibits cell proliferation in GBM
  cells
caption: 'A, B CCK-8 assays were used to measure the cell viability (absorbance value
  at 450 nm) of U87 and U251 cells after treatment with fatostatin. The IC50 of U87
  cells was 21.38 μM, and the IC50 of U251 cells was 19.44 μM. C, D Live/Dead cell
  double staining assays were conducted in U87 and U251 cells. The percentage of PI-positive
  cells was calculated. Fatostatin was used at 20 μM. Scale bars: 50 μm. E Colony-formation
  assays were conducted in U87 and U251 cells. The colony numbers were counted by
  ImageJ. F–I EdU-DNA synthesis assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Representative
  images are shown in (F, G), scale bars: 50 μm. Quantification data show the percentage
  of EdU-positive U87 and U251 cells. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
