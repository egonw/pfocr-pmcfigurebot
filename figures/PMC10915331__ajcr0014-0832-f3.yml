caption: High expression CXCL12+ tumor-associated macrophages (TMAs) were a subset
  of infiltrating macrophage in human HCC. (A) The UMAP plot of single macrophages
  obtained from one patient, representing four distinct clusters including CXCL12+
  TMAs. Each dot corresponds to one single cell, with circles colored according to
  cell clusters. (B) Relative abundance of four types of macrophages in scRNA-seq
  analysis of human liver samples obtained from tumor and para-tumor liver sites.
  (C) A volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared between CXCL12+
  TMAs and other macrophages. Each colored dot denotes an individual gene with an
  adjusted p-value of <0.05. (D) Violin plots of significant markers in four types
  of macrophage. (E) GSEA analysis using C2, C3, C5, and C7 gene sets. (F) A heatmap
  of the top 20 genes expressed in three pathways indicated in the figure. (G) A dot
  plot of the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes in four types
  of macrophages. (H) A bar plot showing the difference between CXCL12+ TMA and other
  macrophages in the enrichment of metabolic pathways. (I) A heatmap of the expression
  levels of key enzymes in the metabolic pathway in (H) in four types of macrophages.
