caption: Volcano plot showing the DEGs in the GSE54129. Red color indicates the upregulated
  genes and green color indicates the downregulated genes. THBS2 is indicated by a
  black point in the plot as a significantly upregulated gene. Further analyses were
  performed on THBS2 as a significant high-expressed mRNA.
