caption: Homocysteine formation and mode of action in plants. The chloroplast pathway
  of Hcy formation (in green); the cytosolic pathway of Hcy formation (in orange).
  Hcy can be converted to Hcy-thiolactone, which modifies proteins by N-homocyteinylation.
  Hcy can also bind to cysteine residues of a protein, forming a disulfide bound resulting
  in S-homocysteinylation of proteins. AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine;
  Cys, cysteine; CysT, cystathionine; CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; Hcy, homocysteine,
  HTase, Hcy-thiolactone hydrolase; MetRS, methionyl-tRNA synthetase; MS, methionine
  synthase; NO, nitric oxide; SAHH, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase.
