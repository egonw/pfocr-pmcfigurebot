caption: 'Plumbagin abolished mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α target genes under
  hypoxia. (A,B) The mRNA expression of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 was determined by qRT-PCR.
  MCF-7 cells were treated with 1, 2, and 4 μM of plumbagin for 24 h under hypoxic
  conditions. The relative mRNA expression was quantified and normalized with GAPDH.
  Data are means ± SEM from three independent experiments (n = 3). # p < 0.05 vs.
  normoxic, * p < 0.05 vs. mimic hypoxic group without treatment. (C,D) The VEGF protein
  expression was investigated by Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were treated with 0,
  1, 2, and 4 μM of plumbagin for 24 h under hypoxic conditions. The relative quantities
  of VEGF protein were quantified and normalized with β-actin. Data are means ± SEM
  from three independent experiments (n = 3).'
