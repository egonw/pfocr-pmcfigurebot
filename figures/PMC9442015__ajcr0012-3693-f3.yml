caption: 'Abnormal expression of Ku80, FOXF2 correlates with clinical characteristics
  of colon cancer patients. (A) Immunohistochemical scores of Ku80 and (B) FOXF2 expression
  in colon cancer and normal control group; (C) Ku80 expression in colon tissues:
  (a) Negative; (b) Weakly positive; (c) Positive; (d) Strongly positive. Expression
  of Ku80 in colon cancer tissues: (e) Negative; (f) Weakly positive; (g) Positive;
  (h) Strong positive. (D) FOXF2 expression in colon tissues: (a) Negative; (b) Weakly
  positive; (c) Positive; (d) Strongly positive. Expression of FOXF2 in colon cancer
  tissues: (e) Negative; (f) Weakly positive; (g) Positive; (h) Strong positive. SP
  ×400; (E) The transcriptional expression of Ku80 (XRCC5) in pan-cancer; (F) The
  transcriptional expression of KDM1A (LSD1) in pan-cancer; (G) The transcriptional
  expression of FOXF2 in pan-cancer. (H) XRCC5 is expressed at the transcription level
  in the colon cancer dataset; (I) KDM1A is expressed at the transcription level in
  the colon cancer dataset; (J) FOXF2 is expressed at the transcription level in the
  colon cancer dataset; (K) XRCC5 is positively correlated with the expression of
  KDM1A (LSD1); (L) KDM1A (LSD1) is negatively correlated with FOXF2 expression; (M)
  XRCC5 is negatively correlated with FOXF2 expression.'
article_title: LSD1 regulates the FOXF2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by
  interacting with Ku80 to promote colon cancer progression.
