caption: 'TAM treatment does not compromise the metabolic health status of 8 weeks
  old IndβLRH-1 mice(A) The body weight of IndβLRH-1 treated or not with TAM was monitored
  for several weeks before (negative weeks) and after (positive weeks) treatment.
  TAM started at week 0 for five consecutive days.(B) Blood glucose levels were also
  monitored starting at week one post TAM treatment.(C) An OGTT was conducted 4 weeks
  post TAM treatment.(D and E) Circulating levels of (D) ALT and (E) AST were assessed
  1 week and 8 weeks post TAM treatment. As positive control, liver damage was induced
  using diquat dibromide (125 mg/kg body weight). Results are expressed as means ±
  SEM (F) Representative images of pancreas sections from IndβLRH-1 treated or not
  with TAM co-stained for YFP (green), insulin (INS, red), and glucagon (GLUC, white).
  Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar: 25 μM. (G-I) LRH-1 transcript levels were
  assessed in (G) islets, (H) liver, and (I whole brain extracted from IndβLRH-1 mice
  treated or not with TAM. Expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene
  Cyclophilin (CYCLO) or β-Actin. Statistics: Results are expressed as means ± SEM
  ∗p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test, vehicle versus TAM.'
