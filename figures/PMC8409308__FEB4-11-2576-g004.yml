caption: 'Molecular evidence for anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways in Nepenthes x
  ventrata pitchers. (A) Anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways. Red, blue, and green colors
  represent putative pathways for cyanidin 3‐O‐glucoside synthesis in N. x ventrata.
  In black, the metabolic pathway for pelargonidin and delphinidin synthesis; both
  compounds were not found in this study. Enzymes involved in the pathway are indicated
  in italics: ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; C3ˈH, 5‐O‐(4‐coumaroyl)‐D‐quinate 3′‐monooxygenase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, bifunctional dihydroflavonol
  4‐reductase/flavonone 4‐reductase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′‐hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid
  3′‐monooxygenase; F3H, naringenin 3‐dioxygenase; HCT, shikimate O‐hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; UFGT, anthocyanidin 3‐O‐glucosyltransferase. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis. Gene expression profiles of 30 unique transcripts in anthocyanin biosynthetic
  pathway, based on RPKM values. Candidate genes with log2RPKM > 2 in at least one
  sample (columns 1, 2, and 3; independent N. x ventrata pitcher samples harvested
  on three consecutive days) are represented.'
