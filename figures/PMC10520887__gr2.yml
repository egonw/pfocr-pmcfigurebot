caption: pIKKε deficiency impairs Psting-mediated antiviral response.A–D, pIKKε−/−
  3D4/21 cells and 3D4/21 cells in 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated
  with transfection of 2′3′-cGAMP (2 μg/ml) for 8 h. The stimulated cells were infected
  with HSV1-GFP (0.01 MOI) for 36 h. The GFP signals were visualized by fluorescence
  microscopy (A). The infected cells were harvested to measure the protein expressions
  by Western blotting (B), GFP signals by flow cytometry (C), and the HSV1 gB gene
  expression by RT–qPCR (D). E and F, the viral titer in the supernatant from HSV1-infected
  cells was measured by TCID50 assay (E) and plaque assay (F), respectively. HSV1,
  herpes simplex virus 1; MOI, multiplicity of infection; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; qPCR,
  quantitative PCR; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TCID50, 50% tissue culture
  infectious dose.
