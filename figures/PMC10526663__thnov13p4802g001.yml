caption: Liver transplantation and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (HIR) affect 5-ALA
  metabolism. (A) Relative mRNA expression of genes related to the 5-ALA metabolic
  pathway (ALAS1, ALAD, UROS, UROD, PPOX, HMOX1) in human donor liver before (pre-LT)
  and after (post-LT) transplantation (n = 20). The mRNA level of each gene is normalized
  to that of ACTB. (B) Heatmap of 5-ALA metabolism-related genes expressed at indicated
  conditions (n = 4 for sham, n = 5 for ischemia 1.5 h and reperfusion 6 h). Red,
  high relative expression; blue, low relative expression. (C) Diagram summarizing
  changes in the expression of 5-ALA metabolism-related genes in mice 6 h after HIR.
  (D) The level of porphobilinogen (PBG; metabolite downstream of 5-ALA) in mouse
  HIR liver samples at indicated conditions (n = 10). Results are presented as mean
  Â± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by two-tailed Student's t tests (A) or
  one-way ANOVA (D).
