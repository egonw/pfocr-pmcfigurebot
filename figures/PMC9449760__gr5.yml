caption: Nrf2 knockdown repressed the activation of HER2 signaling pathway and sensitizes
  SK-OV-3 cells to lapatinib treatment (A) Effect of Nrf2 knockdown on the expression
  of HO-1, p-HER2, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 were determined after treatment with Nrf2 siRNA
  or scramble siRNA for 36 h (B) Effect of Nrf2 knockdown on the sensitivity to lapatinib.
  Cell viability was examined after lapatinib treatment for 36 h in Nrf2 siRNA or
  scramble siRNA-transfected cells. Cells were transfected with Nrf2 siRNA or scramble
  siRNA using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instruction.
  Data show the mean ± SD (three independent experiments). ∗∗∗p < 0.001. The original
  blots were provided in supplementary data as Supplementary Figure S5.
