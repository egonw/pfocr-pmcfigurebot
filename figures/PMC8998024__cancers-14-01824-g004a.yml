caption: 'Apigenin inhibits cancer cell migration and inactivates the integrin β1-FAK
  signaling pathway. Wound-healing assays were performed with or without 50–100 μM
  apigenin in HeLa (A) and C33A (B) cells for 0, 24, and 48 h. Left: representative
  images of scratches and recovery of wounded areas on cell monolayers at 0, 24, and
  48 h after wounding. Right: semi-quantitative analysis of relative cell migration
  was performed according to the cells moving towards the scratched area at a certain
  time. Cell migration-related proteins p-FAK, paxillin, and integrin β1 were detected
  in HeLa (C) and C33A (D) cells with or without 50 μM apigenin treatment for 24 and
  48 h via Western blotting and quantified. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of
  at least three independent experiments. * and † p < 0.05 indicate significant differences
  as compared with the corresponding control or Api 50-treated groups. CON, 0.1% DMSO;
  Api 50, 50 μM apigenin; Api 100, 100 μM apigenin; Api50 24 h, 50 μM apigenin at
  24 h; Api50 48 h, 50 μM apigenin at 48 h.'
