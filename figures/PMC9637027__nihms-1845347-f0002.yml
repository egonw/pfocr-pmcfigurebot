figure_title: Regulation of A3A (A) and A3B (B) expression by HPV
caption: (A) A3A expression is regulated by transcriptional activation through IFN
  and NF-κB signaling and by protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. HPV induces DNA damage responses, which activate NF-κB signaling. High-risk
  HPV E7 stabilizes A3A protein levels by inhibiting CUL2-mediated ubiquitin ligation.
  (B) A3B expression is epigenetically repressed by the DREAM or PRC1.6 complexes
  in normal tissue but induced by the transcription factors such as TEAD and ZNF384,
  which are enhanced by HPV E6. Enhanced A3B expression may also be linked to pRB-mediated
  degradation by HPV E7. HPV, human papillomavirus; STAT2, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; Casp1, caspase 1; IFN-I, type I interferon;
