caption: 'E2F4 up-regulated IMP4 and promoted the progression of LUAD. (a) Venn chart
  identified E2F4 via analysing the Animal TFDB, hTFtarget, and Chipbase among the
  genes positively associated with IMP4 expression in TCGA-LUAD. (b) TCGA-LUAD database
  verified that IMP4 was positively related to E2F4 expression. (c) The expression
  of E2F4 in LUAD was analysed using the UALCAN based on TCGA database. (d) The survival
  curves of LUAD patients from GEPIA database. (e) Luciferase activities were evaluated
  via performing dual luciferase reporter assay. After pcDNA3.1-E2F4 vector was transfected
  into A549 cells, the mRNA levels of IMP4 (f) and E2F4 (g) were determined using
  qRT-PCR. After pcDNA3.1-E2F4 vector and si-IMP4-2 co-transfection, A549 cell proliferation
  was analysed using the EdU assay (h); apoptosis was assessed using FITC-Annexin
  V/PI apoptosis detection kit (i); the cell cycle was evaluated using cell cycle
  and apoptosis analysis kit (j); invasion was examined using the transwell assay
  (k). ∗P  <  0.05, ∗∗P  <  0.01, ##P  <  0.01.'
