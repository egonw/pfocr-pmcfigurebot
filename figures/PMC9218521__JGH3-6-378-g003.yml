caption: 'A brief representation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) role in sepsis‐induced
  cholestasis. (a) Inflammation‐driven nucleotide‐binding domain (NLRP3) inflammasome
  consists of intracellular proteins NLRP3, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC), and pro‐caspase 1. FXR, a nuclear receptor, blocks mitochondrial
  NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by interfering with NLRP3 and pro‐caspase 1. (b) High
  bile acids levels in the bloodstream lead to: (i) Toll‐like receptor (TLR) ‐nuclear
  factor‐kappa B (NFκB) pathway activation followed by NLRP3 and pro‐IL‐1β synthesis;
  (ii) FXR downregulation, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome assembly with consequent
  caspase‐1 activation engendering IL‐1β from pro‐IL‐1β. FXR activation by bile acids
  depresses bile acids synthesis and induces bile salt export pump (BSEP) expression.
  DAMPs, danger‐associated molecular patterns; IL, Interleukin, leucine‐rich‐containing
  family, pyrin domain‐containing‐3PAMPs, pathogen‐associated molecular patterns.'
