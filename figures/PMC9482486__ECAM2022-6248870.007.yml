caption: XFZYD inhibited the IKBα/NF-κB signaling in rat models with CPB-induced ALI.
  (a) The mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, GSDMD, and caspase 1 in CPB-induced
  lung injury rats treated with XFZYD, Ac-YVAD-CMK, and Bay-11-7082 were measured
  via RT-qPCR. (b and c) western blots were performed to determine NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1
  p20, Pro-GSDMD, GSDMD p30, IL-18, IL-1β p-P65, P65, p-IKBα, and IKBα levels in lung
  tissues of rats with CPB-induced acute lung injury. β-actin was used as a loading
  control for the blots. All the data were presented as the means ± SD. from independent
  experiments performed in triplicate. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01, vs. CPB group.
