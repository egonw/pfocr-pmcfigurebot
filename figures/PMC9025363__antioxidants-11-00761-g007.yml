caption: An overview of responses to salt and drought stress. Responses observed under
  stress are boxed in red. Green boxes are listing strategies successfully used by
  stress-tolerant accessions of investigated plant species to avoid adverse effects
  of stress. Not all of the listed strategies are used by an individual plant. The
  preferred response of a plant species depends on the respective genetic potential.
  Moreover, responses may be scaled depending on the developmental and nutritional
  state of a plant when exposed to stress.
