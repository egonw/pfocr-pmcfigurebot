caption: Experimental protocol and mechanism of action of the AhR in colon cancer
  (A). Model for the AOM/DSS experimental protocol [] (B). The AhR inhibits growth
  of colon tumors by suppressing expression of FOXM1 [] (C). The AhR enhances IL22-mediated
  activation of STAT3 and downstream pathway by suppressing expression of SOCS3 [].
  The figures represent intestinal cells and IL22 is generated by ILCs and other immune
  cells.
