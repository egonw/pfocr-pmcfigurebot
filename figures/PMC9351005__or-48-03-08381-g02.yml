caption: Inhibition of Cx32 expression with shRNA-Cx32 in HepG2 cells, and overexpression
  of Cx32 in HCCLM3 cells. (A and B) Expression level of Cx32 examined by western
  blotting in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. Results represent the mean ± SEM from three
  independent experiments; *P<0.05 vs. the HepG2 group. (C and D) Inhibition of Cx32
  expression with shRNA-Cx32 in HepG2 cells. (E and F) Overexpression of Cx32 in HCCLM3
  cells. Results represent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments; *P<0.05
  vs. the NC group or EV group. The proteins were normalized with β-actin. Cx32, connexin
  32; shRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; EV, empty vector.
