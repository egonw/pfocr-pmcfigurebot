caption: 'Establishment of risk-score system. A Volcano plot of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) using TCGA-NSCLC datasets. B The Venn diagram of the overlapping genes
  of DEGs and 75 ANKRD genes. C Cross-validation for parameter selection in the LASSO
  regression model. D Coefficient profiles for the LASSO model. E Risk score and survival
  time, and heatmap of the five ANKRD genes in the TCGA database. F Kaplan-Meier curves
  were performed to estimate the OS time in the high-risk and low-risk groups of NSCLC
  patients. G Time-dependent ROC curve for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5- year survival.
  H Nomogram for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5- year OS of NSCLC patients. I Calibration
  curve for the OS nomogram model in NSCLC patients. J-M Relationship between clinicopathological
  characteristics and risk scores based on the five ANKRD genes. The distribution
  of risk scores showed statistically significant differences in NSCLC patients stratified
  by WHO stage (J), T stage (K), N stage (L) and primary therapy outcome (M). ROC:
  receiver operating characteristic; OS: overall survival. Bars are the mean value ± SD.
  ns = no significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001'
