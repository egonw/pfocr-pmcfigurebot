caption: Enrichment pathways in PC-OR cell lines. (a) Bubble chart regrouping the
  30 most significantly enriched pathways determined by GSEA analysis. (b) Enrichment
  plot and top 10 enriched genes in the “protein transport along microtubules”. (c)
  Bubble chart derived from the initial analysis (a) and regrouping the top 10 enrichment
  pathways linked to DNA repair mechanisms. (d) Enrichment plot and top 10 enriched
  genes of “double strand break repair” and “DNA repair” pathways. (e) Bubble chart
  derived from the initial analysis in (a) and regrouping the top 10 enrichment pathways
  linked to autophagy mechanisms. (f) Enrichment plot and top 10 enriched genes of
  “positive regulation of macroautophagy” pathway. * p < 0.05.
