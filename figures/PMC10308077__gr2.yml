caption: The functional roles of hepatokines on adipose tissue metabolism. Metabolic
  beneficial or harmful hepatokines bind with and signal through their receptors on
  adipose tissue and influence downstream pathway, further regulate multifaceted function
  of adipocytes, including glucose uptake, thermogenesis, lipolysis, inflammation,
  fibrosis, adipogenesis, proliferation and lipogenesis, which finally modulate fat
  accumulation and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and whole-body metabolism.
