caption: Molecular processes involved in the production of NO in endothelial cells
  and induction of vasodilation in smooth muscle cells.In response to environmental,
  neuronal, humoral or mechanical stimuli (e.g., ACh, bradykinin or shear stress),
  NO is synthesized in endothelial cells (EC) from l-arginine (l-Arg) by the activated
  form of endothelial NO synthase. NO diffuses to neighboring vascular smooth muscle
  cells (VSMC) where it activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which subsequently
  increases the intracellular cGMP production from GTP. B, basal form; 6c, 6-coordinate
  form; 5c, 5-coordinate form (fully activated). NO may directly (or via a pathway
  other than producing cGMP) regulate certain target proteins (e.g., Ca2+-activated
  K+ (KCa) channel). cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which regulates
  numerous target proteins, e.g., KCa channel current (IKCa), L-type Ca2+ channel
  current (ICaL), sarcolemma Ca2+-ATPase pump (ICaP), and myosin light chain phosphatase
  (MLCP), which leads to VSMC relaxation. cGMP is degraded into GMP by cyclic nucleotide
  phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Contractile kinetics shows that Ca2+ and cGMP co-mediated
  MLC phosphorylation and cross-bridge attachment. M, fraction of the free form of
  myosin light chain; Mp, fraction of phosphorylated myosin, AMp, fraction of myosin
  attached to actin filament; AM, fraction of attached myosin cross-bridges but dephosphorylated,
  namely, latch state. Total myosin is conserved, i.e., M + Mp + AMp + AM = 1. Note
  that VSMC is connected to EC via myoendothelial gap junctions. R, hormone receptors
  on EC membrane; CaM, calmodulin; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; Iup, sarcoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ uptake current; Irel, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release current;
  IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Drugs blocking the production of NO (L-NAME,
  NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; indigo carmine) and soluble guanylate cyclase,
  sGC (ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4] Oxadiazole [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one; methylene blue); cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Aminoguanidine hydrochloride blocks inducible NOS.
  7-Nitroindazole (7-NI) inhibits neuronal NOS. Copyright authorization for the figure
