caption: Heme biosynthesis pathway in mammalian cells. The pathway involves eight
  enzymes, four located in the cytoplasm and the other four in the mitochondria. The
  first and limiting step is the decarboxylative condensation of the non-essential
  amino acid glycine with succinyl-CoA coming from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  which is catalysed to form δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) by ALA-synthase (ALAS). Eight
  ALA molecules are required to synthesize four porphobilinogen (PBG) molecules that,
  subsequently, are used for the synthesis of a single hydroxymethylbilane molecule
  that is promptly converted to cyclic tetrapyrroles known as porphyrinogens, and
  finally to a heme prosthetic group []. ALAD = δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase;
  PBGD = porphobilinogen deaminase; UROS = Uroporphyrinogen III synthase; UROD = Uroporphyrinogen
  III decarboxylase; CPO = coproporphyrinogen oxidase; PPO = protoporphyrinogen oxidase;
  FC = ferrochelatase.
