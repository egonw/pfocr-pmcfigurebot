caption: Prediction of the differential function of bacterial associations between
  the Thecate (orange) and Athecate (blue haze) groups in KEGG categories at level
  2 (a) and level 3 (b). Gene functions were predicted from 16S rRNA gene-based microbial
  compositions using the PICRUSt algorithm to make inferences from KEGG annotated
  databases. Relative signal intensity was normalized by the number of the genes for
  each indicated metabolic pathway. * notes the difference is at a significant level
  with p < 0.05.
