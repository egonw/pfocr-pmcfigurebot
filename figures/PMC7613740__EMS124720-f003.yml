figure_title: The tumour microenvironment of RTT tumours shows reduced and dysfunctional
  CD103+ DCs
caption: 'a, T cell influx into NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma 5 days post ACT
  assessed by IF (scale bar 100 μm and 20 μm). Experiment performed twice; representative
  image shown. b, T cell influx into NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma 5 days post
  ACT quantified separately at tumour margin and centre (n = 2 tumours per condition;
  all groups n = 10 ROI, except RTT centre, n = 11 ROI). P-value: **** 1.08E-5, 5.7E-6.
  c, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of IFN-γ response in T cells sorted from
  RTT vs. NTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma (NTT, RTT, n = 4 tumours per condition). d, Heat
  map displaying T cell effector genes in T cells sorted from NTT and RTT tumours
  (NTT, RTT, n = 4 tumours per condition). e, Suppressive myeloid cells (left) and
  CD103+ DCs (right) in NTT and RTT tumours of Braf/PtenOVA melanoma, assessed by
  flow cytometry (n = 9 tumours each). Experiment performed 5 times; displayed is
  a pool of 2 representative experiments. P-value: **** 8E-5, 9.4E-8. f, CD103+MHCII+
  DCs in NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma, assessed by IF (scale bar 100 μm and 20
  μm). Experiment performed twice; representative image shown. g, Quantification of
  CLEC9a+ cells in tumours of NTT and RTT melanoma patients receiving MAPK pathway
  inhibitors (RAFi or RAFi/MEKi combination), assessed by IF staining of matched patient
  biopsies (n = 10 patients, ). h, Gene expression changes in sorted CD103+ DCs from
  NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma assessed by Smart-seq (NTT, n = 4; RTT, n = 5
  sorted tumours; in technical triplicates). . i, Scheme outlining co-culture of CD103+
  DCs isolated from NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma using magnetic cell sorting
  (MACS) with CFSE labelled naïve OT-1 T cells to assess T cell activation potential
  (left) and representative histogram illustrating CFSE signal in T cells (right).
  Experiment performed 6 times; representative example shown. Data in b and e displayed
  at mean ± SEM and analysed using two-tailed unpaired t-test with Welch correction
  for unequal variance or Mann-Whitney U test if not normal distributed. **** P <
  0.0001.'
