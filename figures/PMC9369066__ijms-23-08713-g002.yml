caption: Exercise modulates different signaling pathways affected by aging in skeletal
  muscle. Aging is associated with muscle mass loss and a reduction in muscle strength
  resulting from inefficient pathway of anabolic resistance (characterized by decreased
  insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and proteasome dysregulation and mitochondrial
  dysfunction, specifically reduced expression of factor peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM).
  In addition, increased oxidative stress resulting from the imbalance of increased
  reactive oxygen species, ROS, and reduced nuclear erythroid-2 like factor-2 (Nrf2),
  increased chronic low-grade inflammation (increased proinflammatory cytokines and
  decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines), jointly with myokine dysregulation play
  a key role in muscle alteration observed with aging. Exercising results in improved
  proteostasis regulation where protein synthesis increased while protein degradation
  is reduced. On the other hand, exercise increased mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced
  age-related oxidative damage, diminished chronic inflammation, and improved myokine
  profile, which consequently improves muscle structure and function.
