caption: 'A, The H‐reflex. The H‐reflex is the electrical analogue of the spinal stretch
  reflex. It is elicited by electrical stimulation (via a nerve cuff in animals, or
  cutaneous electrodes in humans) of the largest (i.e. Group 1) afferents from the
  muscle. This afferent input excites the motoneuron monosynaptically (and probably
  oligosynaptically) and leads to muscle contraction. This wholly spinal pathway is
  affected by descending activity from the brain. The operant conditioning protocol
  modifies this descending activity to change H‐reflex size so as to increase reward
  probability. The nerve‐cuff stimulus also excites the largest efferents, which elicit
  a direct muscle response (M‐wave) that precedes the H‐reflex. The inset at lower
  left shows the timing of the M‐wave and H‐reflex in the rat soleus muscle. The computer
  automatically adjusts stimulus amplitude to maintain a target M‐wave size over the
  weeks of H‐reflex conditioning. This ensures that the effective strength of the
  stimulus (i.e. the numbers of efferents and afferents that it excites) remains stable.
  (See Wolpaw () and Chen and Wolpaw () for full methods presentation.) B, Early evidence
  that a new heksor changes an old one. Reflex responses from monkeys after H‐reflex
  down‐conditioning. Left: Average triceps surae H‐reflexes of the awake behaving
  monkeys in the down‐conditioned (trained) leg and the other leg. The H‐reflex in
  the trained leg is much smaller than its control (i.e. original) value, while the
  H‐reflex in the other leg is not changed from its control. Right: Average maximum
  reflex responses to dorsal root stimulation from the same monkeys under anaesthesia
  and after mid‐thoracic spinal cord transection prior to euthanasia. The reflex asymmetry
  created by down‐conditioning is still present, but the reflexes in both legs are
  much larger than the average reflexes in naïve (i.e. unconditioned) animals under
  the same circumstances of anaesthesia and spinal cord transection (indicated by
  the 100% line). The creation of the new H‐reflex heksor does not change the H‐reflex
  in the other leg as measured in the awake behaving animal; but it does change the
  spinal neurons and synapses that combine with neurons and synapses in the brain
  to produce the unchanged H‐reflex in the other leg. This becomes evident when the
  spinal cord is isolated from the brain. The hatched segments indicate the decreases
  produced by the brain. Stated simply, new spinal properties provide the appropriate
  reflex asymmetry (i.e. the reflex is smaller in the down‐trained leg); new brain
  properties insure that the only effect of conditioning evident in the awake behaving
  animal is the smaller H‐reflex in the trained leg. (Modified from Wolpaw (); data
  from Wolpaw and Lee (, ) and Wolpaw et al. ().) C, Nerve transection changes the
  locomotion heksor in both spinal cord and brain. Joint angles of left and right
  hindlimbs during swing and stance phases of clonidine‐induced locomotion 72 days
  after spinalization in a cat in which left lateral gastrocnemius and soleus (LGS)
  muscles had been denervated 49 days before spinalization. During the 49 days before
  spinalization, treadmill training had enabled locomotion to recover from the impairment
  produced by the denervation. To prevent overlap in the display, individual stick
  figures are displaced by an amount equal to the displacement of the foot along the
  horizontal axis. Left and right hindlimbs are shown from left and right sides, respectively.
  Horizontal arrows indicate the direction of hindlimb movement during stance and
  swing phases. After spinal transection, the isolated spinal cord does not respond
  to locomotor training as would the isolated spinal cord of a cat that had not undergone
  previous left LGS denervation and recovery. Spinal locomotion is greatly impaired
  on the left side (i.e. the denervated side). This indicates that both the spinal
  cord and the brain components of the locomotion heksor had changed in the process
  that restored locomotion after the left LGS denervation. The result is that, after
  transection, the isolated spinal cord does not achieve spinal locomotion. (Reprinted

  implanted with soleus EMG electrodes walks on a treadmill. The traces show the right
  and left soleus locomotor EMG bursts that support the right and left stance phases
  of the step cycle. E and F, Soleus H‐reflex conditioning affects how locomotion
  is produced. E, H‐reflex conditioning affects locomotor EMG. Average absolute value
  of right soleus locomotor EMG bursts before (continuous black) and after (dotted
  blue or red) right soleus H‐reflex conditioning in a down‐conditioned rat (left,
  blue) and an up‐conditioned rat (right, red). Because the H‐reflex pathway contributes
  to the locomotor burst, the burst is smaller after down‐conditioning and larger
  after up‐conditioning. (Modified from Chen et al. (). Copyright (2005) Society for
  Neuroscience.) F, The EMG changes affect locomotor joint angles, but locomotion
  is not impaired. Centre: Right stance‐phase anterior‐ankle, posterior‐knee, and
  anterior‐hip joint angles as a rat walks on the treadmill. Left: Left to right,
  the first image shows the angles before down‐conditioning of the right soleus H‐reflex.
  The second shows that the weaker soleus burst (e.g. E, left‐side) decreases ankle
  angle. This alone would lower the right hip and cause right–left asymmetry in hip
  height (i.e. the animal would tilt to the right). However, as the third image shows,
  a concurrent increase in hip angle makes up for the decrease in ankle angle, so
  that right hip height does not change. The joint angles change, but the key feature,
  right–left symmetry in hip height, is maintained. Right: Left to right, the first
  image shows the angles before up‐conditioning of the right soleus H‐reflex. The
  second shows that the stronger soleus burst (e.g. E, right‐side) increases ankle
  angle. This alone would raise the right hip and cause right–left asymmetry in hip
  height (i.e. the animal would tilt to the left). However, as the third image shows,
  a concurrent decrease in hip angle makes up for the increase in ankle angle so that
  right hip height does not change. The joint angles change, but the key feature,
  right–left symmetry in hip height, is maintained. (Modified from Chen et al. ().)
  G, Sensory feedback guides plasticity in the locomotion heksor. Step symmetry versus
  final H‐reflex size after up‐conditioning (red) or down‐conditioning (blue) for
  normal rats (left) and for DA rats (right), in which transection of the dorsal ascending
  (DA) tract has removed most proprioceptive sensory feedback. In normal rats, H‐reflex
  up‐conditioning or down‐conditioning does not affect step symmetry (i.e. 100% indicates
  original (pre‐conditioning) right–left ratio in step length). In contrast, in DA
  rats, conditioning creates asymmetries that correlate with its direction and magnitude.
  In the DA rats, the supraspinal component of the locomotion heksor lacks the sensory
  feedback it needs to guide changes that prevent the new H‐reflex heksor from causing
  right–left asymmetry in step length. (From Chen et al. (), which provides full description.)
  H, Soleus H‐reflex conditioning oppositely affects the quadriceps H‐reflex. Average
  right soleus (R SOL) and right quadriceps (R QD) poststimulus EMG for a control
  day (continuous line) and for a day near the end of conditioning (dashed line) for
  an up‐conditioned (HRup) rat and a down‐conditioned (HRdown) rat. After up‐conditioning
  the R SOL H‐reflex is larger and the R QD H‐reflex is smaller, while after down‐conditioning
  the R SOL H‐reflex is smaller and the R QD H‐reflex is larger. Background EMG (EMG
  at time 0) and M‐waves do not change. The effects on the R QD may result from the
  changes in the locomotion heksor that maintain the key features of locomotion despite
  the plasticity that creates the new H‐reflex heksor (see text). Peaks in the first
  1–2 ms after stimulation are stimulus artifacts. (From Chen et al. (), which provides
  full description.)'
