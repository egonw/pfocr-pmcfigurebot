caption: Potential roles of H2S in counteracting DMD. Several mechanisms of the cytoprotective
  effect of H2S on the dystrophic phenotype are suggested. The anti-fibrotic effect
  is the result of reduced fibrosis-related cytokine production, decreased collagen
  accumulation, the main component of the ECM, and inhibition of the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling
  pathway. H2S prevents loss of locomotor activity by enhancing muscle strength. The
  improvement in the DMD phenotype is also caused by the anti-inflammatory properties
  of H2S, as indicated not only by an increase in the number of cells expressing anti-inflammatory
  markers such as CD206, but also by a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and infiltration of inflammatory cells. H2S increases the expression of
  autophagy regulators and antioxidant enzymes while simultaneously preventing ROS
  production. Furthermore, it exerts a cardioprotective effect by opening KATP channels,
  thus reducing calcium loading and preserving cell viability
