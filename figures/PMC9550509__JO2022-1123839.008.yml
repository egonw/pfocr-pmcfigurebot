caption: 'FLOT1 overexpression resisted miR-1271-5p upregulation-induced suppression
  on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CC cells. (a-h). The expressions of Wnt1,
  β-catenin, p-β-catenin and p-β-catenin/β-catenin in CC (SiHa and ME180) cells transfected
  with FLOT1 overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination
  were determined by qRT-PCR (G/H) and western blot (a-f), with GAPDH as the reference
  gene. +P < 0.05; ++P or ^^P or ##P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P or ###P < 0.001; + vs. FLOT1+MC;
  ^ vs. NC+MC; # vs. FLOT1+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical cancer; qRT-PCR: quantitative
  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; NC: negative control; M: miR-1271-5p
  mimic; MC: mimic control; FLOT1: flotillin 1.'
