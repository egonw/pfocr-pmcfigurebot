caption: 'Myricetin reduced ROS production and apoptosis in PC12 cells through activating
  NRF2 pathway. (A) The generation of mitochondrial ROS in each group was detected
  by MitoSOX (red) and DAPI (blue) staining. (B) The cell ROS in each group was analyzed
  using flow cytometry after DCF-DA staining. (C) Quantitative analysis of flow cytometry
  after DCF-DA staining (n = 3 per group). (D) The protein bands of Cleaved Caspase-3,
  BAX, and BCL-2 were detected by Western blot. (E) Quantitative analysis of Western
  blot bands (n = 4 per group). (F) The apoptosis in each group was analyzed using
  flow cytometry after Annexin V FITC and PI co-staining. (G) Quantitative analysis
  of flow cytometry after Annexin V FITC and PI co-staining (n = 4 per group). The
  data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Scale bar:
  200 μm.'
