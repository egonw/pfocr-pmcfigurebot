caption: The compositions of viral community-wide AMGs across different host orders.
  Bubble sizes show the occurred frequency (%) of viruses that encode AMGs belonging
  to specific functional pathway, among all lytic (a) or temperate (b) viruses that
  could infect the given host order. The statistical significance was determined by
  Fisher’s exact test (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01)
