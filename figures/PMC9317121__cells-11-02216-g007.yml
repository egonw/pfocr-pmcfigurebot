caption: Expression of Dlx3 during mouse tooth development. (a–e). Bright images.
  (a’–e’) In situ hybridization for Dlx3 expression during mouse tooth formation.
  At the cap stage (E14–E15), the anti-Dlx3 probe is strongly present in the dental
  mesenchyme and osteogenetic mesenchyme developing alveolar bone and is moderately
  visible in the dental epithelium and Meckel’s cartilage. At new birth (NB) and PNs
  1 and 5, expression of Dlx3 can be detected in ameloblasts, odontoblasts, dental
  papilla, and dental follicles, as well as in the mesenchyme in the alveolar bone.
  At PN 1, Dlx3 expression is more intense in ameloblasts, odontoblasts, and dental
  papilla than in developing alveolar bone mesenchymal cells. (f,f’). Tooth tissues
  were immunostained with anti-Dlx3 antibody, showing that the Dlx3 expression is
  apparent in ameloblasts, dental pulp cells, and odontoblasts at PN 2 of mouse tooth
  development. (f’) shows higher a magnification of the box in (f). The tissue sections
  were stained with anti-IgG serum as the negative control. (g’) shows a higher magnification
  of the box in (g). ab, alveolar bone; am, ameloblasts; con, control; D, dentin;
  de, dental epithelium; dm, dental mesenchyme; df, dental follicle; dp, dental papilla;
  E, enamel; E, embryonic day; mc, Meckel’s cartilage; od, odontoblasts; PN, postnatal
  day. The data are unpublished.
