caption: 'Functional and pharmacological roles of SLC7A11 in cancer: The function
  of SLC7A11 in cancer can be divided into four aspects: antioxidant function, ferroptosis,
  nutrient dependency, and tumour microenvironment. SLC7A11, as a cystine/glutamate
  antiporter, imports cystine and mediates the export of glutamate at a ratio of 1:1.
  Cysteine is also formed by methionine through trans-sulphuration. Cysteine synthesises
  glutathione with glutamate and glycine, and participates in oxidative-stress-related
  processes, such as ferroptosis, apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  ER stress, DNA damage, and drug resistance. SLC7A11 is involved in disulphide stress
  and anaplerosis to make tumour cells become nutrient dependent. Disulphide stress:
  the cystine transported by SLC7A11 is reduced to cysteine under the action of NADPH,
  most of which is produced by the pentose phosphate pathway. Anaplerosis: Extracellular
  glutamine is taken up into the cells and converted to glutamate by GLS. Glutamate
  is converted into α-KG under GDH, and participates in the TCA cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation. The amount of cysteine and glutamate in the tumour microenvironment
  could affect the survival, proliferation, activation, and function of various immune
  cells, such as T cells, Treg cells, MDSCs, and DC cells. Moreover, cytokines released
  by immune cells could affect the expression and function of SLC7A11 in tumour cells.
  SLC7A11 might be related ro the CAFs or vascular remodelling. ASCT2: alanine–serine–cysteine
