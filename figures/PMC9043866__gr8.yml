caption: Schematic of TAZ regulation in the inflammatory responseAfter shuttling into
  the nucleus, TAZ might drive transcription of Nrf2 by interacting with the TEAD
  transcription factor and induce nc translocation of Nrf2 to enhance antioxidant
  capacity with reduction of intracellular ROS, resulting in impediment of NF-κB activation
  to ameliorate the microglia-mediated inflammatory response. Simultaneously, TAZ
  rescued microglia from apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, followed
  by blockage of mPTP opening and Cyt C release from mitochondria into the cytosol.
