caption: Novel regulation of NLRP3 and gasdermin D. There are many signaling pathways
  influencing the functions of the NLRP3 inflammasome and gasdermin D to regulate
  the occurrence of pyroptosis. For example, the PINK1-PARK2 pathway induces the release
  of dopamine to function on PYD to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition,
  PKM2 selectively activates EIF2AK2 phosphorylation to trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome
  in macrophages. The kinase NEK7 can combine with NLRP3 to control the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is suppressed by phosphorylation of PLK4 and is
  formed by deubiquitinating the Spata2-CYLD complex. DDX3X is coupled with the NACHT
  domain of full-length NLRP3. The CARD8 inflammasome senses the activities of HIV-1
  protease and DPP8/9 inhibitor to regulate NLRP3-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis.
  VbP disrupts the interaction of NLRP1 and DPP9 to accelerate the degradation of
  N-terminal fragments. The cGAS-STING pathway promotes the NF-κB function on caspase-1
  to induce pyroptosis, which is suppressed by melatonin. Furthermore, the mTORC1-Ragulator-Rag
  pathway promotes ROS production to regulate the oligomerization of GSDMD and pore
  formation. The ESCRT system repairs membrane pores to alleviate pyroptosis and inhibit
  the production of IL-1β, which is otherwise upregulated by calcium efflux. GPX4
  blocks lipid peroxidation to suppress GSDMD activity and inhibits caspase-1/11 to
  prevent the production of GSDMD-NT. ELANE-mediated GSDMD cleavage produces an active
  GSDMD-eNT that causes pyroptosis. Finally, IRF7 can physically interact with GSDMD-NT
  to cause pyroptosis
