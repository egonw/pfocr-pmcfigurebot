caption: CIRP silencing leads to the cell being more prone to apoptosis in response
  to oxidative injury. (a) Cell survival analysis using CCK-8 assay. (b) Phase-contrast
  images and cells apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry with PE-conjugated-Annexin
  V staining. HEK293T cells were transfected with the SaiCIRP vector or control vector
  for 3 days, followed by the addition of H2O2 at different concentrations for another
  24 hours; then, the cells were subjected to CCK8 assay or phase-contrast images
  analysis or stained with PE-conjugated-Annexin V and flow cytometry analysis. The
  statistical data were presented as mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments.
  n ≥ 3; ∗P < 0.05.
