figure_title: Metabolic activity correlates with drug sensitivity and resistance
caption: Sankey plot of sensitivity associations (Pearson‐rho P‐value < 0.05) between
  metabolic pathway classes (left) and drug classes (right).−log10(P‐value)*correlation
  direction (iterative hypergeometric test) for associations between rapamycin IC50
  and SMPDB core metabolic pathways, highlighting key pathways associated with resistance
  (positive) and sensitivity (negative) to rapamycin.Spectrum of relative resistance
  to glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis for all drugs studied, highlighting drugs
  with most extreme anticorrelation between the two pathways.Correlations between
  metabolic resistance associations for the most anticorrelated drugs. Metabolic pathway
  correlations against drug sensitivities are compared for all drugs. Red squares
  represent known drug synergies from DrugCombDB. Drug synergies tend to coincide
  with anticorrelated metabolic sensitivities.
