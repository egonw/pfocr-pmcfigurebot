caption: OEA inhibited the apoptosis of H9C2 cells after OGD/R induced by high glucose.
  (A) Flow cytometry was performed on each group of cells using FITC/PE channel. Annexin
  V fluorescence intensity was represented on the horizontal axis. PI fluorescence
  intensity was represented on the vertical axis, and Q2 region represents the number
  of apoptotic cells. (B) Statistical analysis of apoptotic cells was carried out
  by flow cytometry (n = 3). (C) DAPI fluorescent dye (nucleus, blue) and TUNEL (green)
  were used for immunofluorescence staining of cells in each group, scale = 100 μm.
  (D) DAPI fluorescent dye (nucleus, blue) and cleaved caspase-3 (red) were used for
  immunofluorescence staining of cells in each group, scale = 50 μm. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SEM, δδP <0.01 vs. HG group, and ♦♦p < 0.01 vs. HG + OGD/R group.
