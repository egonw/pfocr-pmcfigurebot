caption: Crosstalk between AAA-related pathways. (a) We analyzed the path crosstalk
  network using the cumulative hypergeometric algorithm. The size of the dot represents
  the degree of connectivity of the pathways, and the larger is the shape, the higher
  is the degree of connectivity; the connection line represents the relationship between
  the paths, and a darker color indicates a more significant relationship between
  pathways. (b) The histogram represents the distribution of the connectivity of the
  pathways. The horizontal axis is connectivity, and the vertical axis is the pathway.
