caption: Apigenin inhibits fibrous scar formation after spinal cord injury. (A–F)
  Expression of Actα2, Col1α1, Col1α2, Col4α1, Fn and Ngf in spinal cord homogenates
  after injured 28 days detected by qRT‐PCR. (G) Protein was extracted from spinal
  cord tissues 28 days after spinal cord injury, and the expression of α‐SMA was detected
  by Western blotting. (H) Quantitative analysis of α‐SMA expression. (* means p < 0.05;
  ** means p < 0.01; *** means p < 0.001; **** means p < 0.0001, p values were calculated
  with one‐way anova, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. n = 3)
