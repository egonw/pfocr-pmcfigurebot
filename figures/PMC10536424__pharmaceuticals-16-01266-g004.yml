caption: Emerging central nervous system (CNS)-related indications of PDE5 inhibitors.
  In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive deficiency disease models, PDE5 inhibition
  increases presynaptic cGMP levels, which, through PKG activation, enhances the release
  of glutamate and activates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). On the other
  hand, postsynaptic PKG activates transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) response element-binding element (CREB), promoting neurotransmission, synaptic
  plasticity and memory consolidation. PKG also activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  that mediates neuroprotection via the inhibition of apoptosis and also suppresses
  tau hyper-phosphorylation via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β).
  Elevated cGMP levels exhibit other cognitive enhancement mechanisms, such as vasodilation,
  which improves or maintains cerebrovascular endothelial function, preventing Aβ
  amyloid accumulation, rise in acetylcholine (ACh) and brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) levels in the cortex, striatum, and other areas of the brain, facilitation
  of neurogenesis, suppression of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, all averting
  neuronal loss. In strokes, PDE5-Is could induce angiogenesis and neurogenesis and
  enhance cerebral blood flow to ischemic regions. PDE5-Is have anxiolytic effects
  in part due to enhanced oxytocin release. Moreover, PDE5-Is can promote efficient
  reconstitution of the myelin sheath and govern the Inflammatory processes involved
  in demyelination models of multiple sclerosis. PDE5-Is are also beneficial in noise-induced
  hearing loss via activating cGMP/protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1/poly (ADP-ribose)
  polymerase (cGMP/PRKG1/PARP) signaling in response to traumas in cochlea sensory
  cells. PDE5-Is exhibit pain-relieving effects in neuropathic pain models via enhanced
  release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). P = phosphorylation.
