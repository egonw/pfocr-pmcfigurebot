caption: ZDHHC9 promotes the expression of PD-L1 in colon cancer. (A) PD-L1 protein
  expression levels were detected in ZDHHC9-KD MC38 cells and control MC38 cells using
  flow cytometry. (B) The protein expression levels of PD-L1 were detected in ZDHHC9-KD
  DLD-1 cells and control DLD-1 cells using flow cytometry. (C) Detection of ZDHHC9
  expression using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting in
  DLD1 cells. (D) The expression levels of PD-L1 protein were detected in ZDHHC9-overexpressing
  and control cells (MIGR1-EV) using flow cytometry. (E) Western blotting was performed
  to determine the activation of the JAK1 signaling pathway in ZDHHC9-KD MC38 and
  control MC38 cells treated with or without IFN-γ. (F) Western blotting was performed
  to determine the activation of the JAK1 signaling pathway in ZDHHC9-KD MC38 and
  control MC38 cells treated with or without IFN-γ. **P<0.01. ZDHHC9, zinc finger
  DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 9; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; NC, negative
  control; KD, knockdown.
