caption: 'Establishment of risk prognostic model. (A) Univariate Cox regression analysis
  preliminary screening results. (B) Partial likelihood deviance was plotted versus
  log (Lambda). The vertical dotted line indicates the lambda value with the minimum
  error and the largest lambda value. (C) LASSO coefficient profiles of the genes
  screening by univariate Cox regression analysis. (D) The patient samples from TCGA
  were divided into high and low risk groups based on risk score and the OS of the
  groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier. (E) OS analysis of high and low risk groups
  from the GEO samples. LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. OS:
  overall survival.'
