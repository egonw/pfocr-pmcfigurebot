caption: Tentative biodegradation pathway for poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
  (PBAT) in aerobic conditions. PBAT is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular
  enzymes—namely, PBAT hydrolase, cutinases, esterases, and lipases—to its monomer
  constituents of terephthalic acid, 1,4-butanediol, and adipic acid. Terephthalic
  acid is broken down into protocatechuate, which is further metabolized to pyruvic
  acid, and acetyl-CoA units. 1,4-butanediol is oxidized to 4-hydroxybutyrate and
  subsequently to succinyl-CoA units. Adipic enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  by conversion to adipyl-CoA, which is later metabolized through the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy, thereby releasing CO2 and water. Adapted from
  [,].
