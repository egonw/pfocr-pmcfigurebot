caption: A scheme of intracellular glucose metabolism. The sorbitol pathway is shown
  horizontally, and the glycolysis pathway is shown vertically. Note that nicotinamide
  dinucleotide (NADH) is generated in both pathways, leading to an increased NADH-NAD+
  ratio, which is the cellular representation of hypoxia. This is counteracted by
  the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and in the mitochondrial Krebs cycle. The
  presence of high lactate concentrations in dialysis fluids may inhibit the lactate
  dehydrogenase activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction is often present in kidney
  failure, which might affect the compensatory mechanisms and cause pseudohypoxia.
