caption: Pathway enrichment analysis. (a) The pathway enrichment analysis was performed
  to find metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched in peak-neighboring
  genes based on the KEGG database, thereby investigating metabolic pathways that
  might be orchestrated by transcription factors and that might be mediated by transcription
  factors at different developmental stages and cell states. The pathway enrichment
  analysis can directly reflect the effect of genes on phenotypes and maximize the
  relationship between significantly enriched metabolic pathways and phenotypes. The
  selected peak-neighboring genes were annotated based on the KEGG database to obtain
  all of the metabolic pathways in which peak-neighboring genes were involved. All
  of the peak-neighboring genes were assigned to different metabolic pathways. Fisher's
  exact test was used to calculate the significance of gene enrichment in each pathway.
  In order to screen out the metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched in
  peak-neighboring genes, the top 15 entries were chosen in the pathway enrich analysis
  where peak-neighboring genes were significantly enriched as the horizontal axis
  histogram. The horizontal axis in the histogram was employed to show -log10 (P value),
  and the vertical axis was the pathway name. Meanwhile, the top 25 entries were selected
  in the pathway enrich analysis in which peak-neighboring genes were significantly
  enriched as a vertical axis histogram. In the histogram, the horizontal axis showed
  the pathway name, and the vertical axis represented enrichment. In all charts, red
  represented significant items, and blue marked nonsignificant items. (b) The results
  of the pathway enrichment analysis of peak-neighboring genes were presented in a
  bubble chart. The top 20 pathway entries were selected, in which peak-neighboring
  genes were significantly enriched for displaying. The ordinate in the figure stood
  for the pathway entry, and the abscissa indicated the rich factor. The size of the
  dot in the figure indicated the number of peak-neighbor genes enriched on the pathway
  entry, and the color represented the significance P value of the pathway entry.
  The smaller the P value, the more significant the set. The pathway enrichment degree
  was measured using the rich factor, P value, and the number of genes enriched in
  this pathway entry. Among them, the rich factor referred to the ratio of the number
  of peak-neighbor genes enriched in the pathway entry to the number of all genes
  annotated to the pathway entry. The greater the rich factor, the greater the degree
  of enrichment.
