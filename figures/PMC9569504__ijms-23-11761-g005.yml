caption: 'Expression levels of ETC complex subunits and PGC1-NRF1/2 signaling pathway
  proteins during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. (a) Western blot of ETC complex
  subunits ND1, CYTB, ATP6A1, SDHA, and COXIV in C2C12 cells during differentiation
  on D1, D3, and D5 after treatment with UCF101 (20 μM) or no treatment and quantification
  of Western blots relative to GM (n = 3). (b) Western blot of PGC1α, NRF1, NRF2,
  and VDAC in C2C12 myoblasts at differentiation on D1, D3, and D5 after treatment
  with UCF101 (20 μM) or no treatment and quantification of Western blots relative
  to GM (n = 3). Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests were used. Statistical significance:
  * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01. ND1, NADH1; SDHA, succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein
  subunit A; COXIV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4; CYTB, cytochrome b; ATP6, ATP
  synthase F0 subunit 6.'
