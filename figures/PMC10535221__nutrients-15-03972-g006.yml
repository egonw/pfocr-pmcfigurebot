caption: HAs-regulated expression of apoptotic proteins through the activation of
  the AMPK signaling pathway in LoVo cells. (A) LoVo cells treated with Compound C
  (10 Î¼M) for 1 h and subsequently treated with HAs (3 mg/mL) for 24 h. Treated cells
  were subjected to Western blotting to analyze the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt.
  (B) AMPK activating apoptotic proteins.
