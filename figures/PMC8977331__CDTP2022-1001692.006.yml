caption: Western blot analysis of apoptosis-associated proteins. Western blotting
  was utilized to evaluate the protein levels of cleaved caspase-9, Cyt-C, Bcl-2,
  and Bax. GAPDH acted as the internal reference (n = 6 for each cohort). Data are
  articulated as mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
