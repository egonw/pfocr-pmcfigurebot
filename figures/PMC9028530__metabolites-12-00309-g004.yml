caption: KEGG pathway analysis and dynamic changes in the plasma levels of differential
  metabolites. (a) KEGG enrichment analysis of 29 differential metabolites identified
  in control group cows; the circle size represents the enrichment ratio. The p value
  is represented in terms of color in which a deeper color (red) of circles represents
  a decreasing trend. (b) Pathway analysis of 29 differential metabolites identified
  in control group cows using topology analysis; the circle size represents the pathway
  impact. (c) Metabolic pathways involving major metabolites that differed in plasma
  concentration between the exercise and control cows at −7 d, 0 d, +7 d, and +30
  d relative to calving. Four circles indicate the metabolites identified in control
  group cows at −7 d, 0 d, +7 d, and +30 d relative to calving. The color of circles
  indicates the relative abundance of the metabolite in which blue (red) circles represent
  low (high) relative abundance. The symbol “+“ indicates that the metabolite concentrations
  are higher in the exercise group than in the control group, and the symbol “-” indicates
  that the metabolite concentrations are lower in the exercise group than in the control
  group. NEFA = non-esterified fatty acids; BHBA = β-hydroxybutyric acid; TG = triglyceride;
  PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate; ALA = arachidonic acid; PLA = palmitoleic acid; LA =
  linoleic acid; PA = palmitic acid; HVA = homovanillic acid; GCA = glycocholic acid;
  TCA = taurocholic acid; CDCA = chenodeoxycholic acid; TCDCA = tauroursodeoxycholic
  acid; GCDCA = glycochenodeoxycholic acid. The figure was created with BioRender
