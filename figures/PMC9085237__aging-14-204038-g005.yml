caption: Effects of inhibitors which may suppress metastasis on the growth of MIA-PaCa-2
  + WT-TP53 and MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells. The effects of the AG1478 EGFR inhibitor
  (A), the gilteritinib ALK/AXL/FLT3 inhibitor (B), the sorafenib multi-kinase inhibitor
  (C) and the galectin-1 inhibitor OTX008 (D) on MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells (solid red
  squares) and MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 cells (solid blue circles) were examined by MTT
  analysis. The MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53, and MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells in each panel were
  all examined at the same time period. These experiments were repeated and similar
  results were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed by the T test on the
  means and standard deviations of various treatment groups. ***P < 0.0001, and **P
  < 0.005.

  of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK, and PI3K/mTORC1/GSK-3
  pathway inhibitors, nutraceuticals and alter metabolic properties.
