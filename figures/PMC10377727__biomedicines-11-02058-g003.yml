caption: Overstimulation of MiR-129-5p plays a protective role in reducing neural
  inflammation and preventing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by reducing the expression
  of the SOX6 gene. Controlling the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR represents a possible
  treatment in AD and PD. Upregulation of miR-129-5p targets genes and maintains neuronal
  homeostasis. Also, by lowering the activity of the mutant FMR1 gene, miR-129-5p
  reduces the risk for diseases in the autism spectrum and Fragile X Syndrome.
