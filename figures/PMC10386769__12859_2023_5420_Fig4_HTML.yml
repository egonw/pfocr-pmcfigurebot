  A Distribution of MDA-5 signaling pathway in untreated (red) and IFNβ-treated (blue)
  CD4+ T cells showing an upregulation of genes related to MDA-5 signaling. B, C Distribution
  of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase activity in untreated (red) and IFNβ-treated
  (blue) CD8+ T cells (B) and NK cells (C) showing an upregulation of genes 2′–5′-oligoadenylate
  synthetase activity. D Boxplots showing pathways that may be differentially regulated
  in neutrophils with multiple genes consistently upregulated or downregulated post-IFNβ
  treatment. E Bar plot showing upregulated MDA-5 (IFIH1), RIG-I (DDX58), and genes
  related to 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase in IFNβ-treated monocytes, neutrophils,
  CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK cells
