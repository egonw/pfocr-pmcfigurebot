figure_title: PLEKHH2 promotes the malignant phenotype of lung cancer cells by activating
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
caption: A GSEA analysis showed that, in lung adenocarcinoma, the expression of PLEKHH2
  enriched in PI3K regulator activity in the TCGA cohort. B GEPIA analysis showed
  that PLEKHH2 was positively correlated with AKT and MAPK in lung adenocarcinoma
  (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). C The upregulation of PLEKHH2 significantly
  increased p-PI3K and p-AKT levels. The p-ERK level was not significantly upregulated,
  and the expression of total PI3K, AKT, and ERK did not change. In the cells with
  downregulated PLEKHH2 expression, p-PI3K and p-AKT levels were decreased, but p-ERK
  did not show a significant reduction. There was no significant change in total PI3K,
  AKT, and ERK proteins. D After inhibiting the PI3K signaling pathway via LY294002
  treatment, an upregulation in PLEKHH2 expression did not significantly increase
  p-PI3K, p-AKT, and proliferation- and invasion-related proteins, as evidenced via
  western blotting. Statistical analysis in lung cancer cell lines is shown in Supplementary
  Fig. A and . Results of the clone formation assay (E, Statistical analysis is shown
  in Supplementary Fig. C and ), CCK-8 assay (F), and Matrigel Transwell assay (G,
  Statistical analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. E and ) showed that the upregulation
  PLEKHH2 expression had no significant effect on cell proliferation and invasion
  ability after treatment with LY294002. P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
