caption: Momilactone biosynthesis pathway and clusters of momilactone A biosynthetic
  genes (MABGCs) in grass genomes.(a) Momilactone A biosynthesis pathway in rice.
  Key enzymes for each catalysis reaction are indicated.(b) Genomic distribution of
  momilactone biosynthetic genes and their homologs in grass genomes. Left panel shows
  the phylogenetic topology of grass species. Red, purple, and green dots in front
  of the species scientific names represent the presence of intact MABGCs, partial
  MABGCs, and other MABGC‐like clusters, respectively. Right panel displays the micro‐genomic
  synteny of MABGCs and MABGC‐like genes among multi‐genomes. Gray rectangle elements
  represent other genes near the genomic regions of MABGC and MABGC‐like clusters.
