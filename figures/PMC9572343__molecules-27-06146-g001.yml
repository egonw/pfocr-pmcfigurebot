caption: Dox Inhibits MKP-2 Expression and Reduces Cell Viability. (A) MKP-2 protein
  expression in breast carcinoma cases. (a) Normal breast tissue with negative MKP-2
  expression, ×100. (b) Invasive ductal carcinoma with negative MKP-2 expression,
  ×200. (c) Invasive ductal carcinoma with mild MKP-2 expression, ×200. (d) Invasive
  ductal carcinoma with moderate MKP-2 expression, ×200. (e) Invasive ductal carcinoma
  with high MKP-2 expression, ×400. (B) MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 cell lysates
  were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then assessed for MKP-2 and β-Actin expression,
  and a confocal image of the immunofluorescence staining for MKP-2 in MDA-MB-231
  cells was taken. (C) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of Dox (0.1–10 µM) for 24 h or with 10 µM up to 24 h, then assessed for MKP-2 and
  β-Actin. (D) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Dox (5 or 10 µM) for 4 or 8 h, and
  then the expression of MKP-2 mRNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. (E)
  Immunofluorescent images of MKP-2 expression in control and cells treated with Dox
  (1 µM) for 24 h. (F) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing concentrations
  of Dox (0.1–10 µM) for 24, 48, or 72 h and then cell viability and % of surviving
  cells were assessed. A correlation analysis of MKP-2 protein expression and cell
  viability was calculated. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M of three independent
  experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, compared with the untreated
  control.
