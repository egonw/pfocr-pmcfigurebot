figure_title: Glucose metabolism via HBP is necessary for mesoderm fate acquisition
  and maintenance
caption: '(A) Schematic of glucose metabolism and its three branches: grey = Hexosamine
  Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP); pink = core/late-stage glycolysis; green = Pentose Phosphate
  Pathway (PPP). Red text indicates chemical inhibitors and their metabolic targets
  in blue. (B) Representative Z-sections showing the expression pattern of Sox2, T/Bra,
  and Lef1 in embryos treated with 2-DG + BrPA for 18h ex vivo and (C) their Theiler
  developmental outcomes: Control (n=17), 2-DG + BrPA (n=24) across 6 experimental
  replicates; early streak (ES), mid-streak (MS), late streak (LS), no bud (OB), early
  bud (EB), late-bud (LB), early head fold (EHF). Scale bars represent 40μm. Plots
  show mean ± SEM. On average, ~53% of control embryos develop to OB stage gastrulation,
  while ~73% of 2-DG + BrPA treated embryos only develop to MS stage gastrulation.
  (D) Representative Z-sections of 2-DG + BrPA and 5μM Azaserine-treated embryos following
  12h ex vivo culture (EVC). Inhibiting glycolysis impairs PS elongation (cyan dotted-lines)
  and reduces T/Bra expression (cyan). Scale bars represent 40μm. (E) Comparison of
  PS distal elongation lengths in embryos treated with various metabolic inhibitors:
  Control (n=44), 2-DG + BrPA (n=16), YZ9 (n=9), 5μM Shikonin (n=9), 5μM Azaserine
  (n=21), 2μM 6-AN (n=4), 10μM Oligomycin (n=8), Galloflavin (n=6). Plots show mean
  ± SEM. Two-tailed parametric t-test. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. (F) Top: Schematic
  of mesoderm directed-differentiation steps from mESCs. Bottom: 2-DG + BrPA, Azaserine,
  and PD-treated groups show a significant absence of Eomes (cyan) and T/Bra (magenta).
  Scale bars represent 100μm. 3 independent experimental replicates. (G) qPCR analyses
  of directed-differentiation experiments, querying transcript changes in mesodermal,
  pluripotency (treatment from day1–4 or day3–4), and (H) HBP genes (treatment from
  day1–4) across 3 independent experimental replicates. Plots show mean ± SEM. Two-tailed
  parametric t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.'
