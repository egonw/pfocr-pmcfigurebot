figure_title: Macrophage GPSM1-driven inflammatory signal regulates co-cultured primary
  adipocytes insulin action and sensitivity
caption: a Primary adipocytes were treated with conditioned media (CM) from LPS-primed
  GPSM1f/f or GPSM1f/f; Lyz2-Cre BMDMs, vehicle-treated BMDMs, and control adipocyte
  medium (fresh media), for 48 h. Protein expression levels of insulin signaling cascades,
  p-IRS1, p-AKT, and AKT after insulin (100 nM) or vehicle stimulation for 15 min
  were assessed using immunoblotting. b Primary adipocytes were treated with conditioned
  media (CM) from LPS-primed GPSM1- or Con-overexpressing BMDMs, vehicle-treated BMDMs,
  and control adipocyte medium (fresh media), for 48 h. Protein expression levels
  of insulin signaling cascades, p-IRS1, p-AKT, and AKT after insulin (100 nM) or
  vehicle stimulation for 15 min were assessed using immunoblotting. c Adiponectin
  levels in culture media were determined using ELISA (n = 3 independent samples per
  condition). Independent experiments were performed three times with similar results
  (a, b). All data are presented as means ± SEM. P values are determined by one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test (c).
