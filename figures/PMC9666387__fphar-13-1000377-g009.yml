caption: Sodium cantharidate (SCA) directly binds and inhibits PI3K. (A) Molecular
  structure of SCA. (B) The 3D structure of the SCA–PI3K complex. (C) Zoom-in view
  of SCA interactions with residues from the PI3K active site; yellow dashed lines
  represent hydrogen bonds and burgundy dashed lines represent salt bridges. (D) Zoom-in
  view of SCA bound to the active pocket of PI3K. (E) 2D representation of the interactions
  between SCA and PI3K; burgundy lines indicate hydrogen bonds, red-to-blue gradient
  lines represent salt bridges, and hydrophobic residues are colored in green.
