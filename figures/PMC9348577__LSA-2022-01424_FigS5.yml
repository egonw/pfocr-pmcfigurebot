figure_title: MDCK cell morphogenesis assay and signalling pathway activation using
  K1K1, K1K1S2, and K1K1S4 mutants
caption: (A) MDCK cell (∼500) were seeded into a thick layer of a 1:1 collagen/Growth
  Factor Reduced Matrigel and treated with semi-log dilutions (100 pM to 300 nM) of
  hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, K1K1, K1K1S2, and K1K1S4 twice a week for
  1 mo. The cells were fixed and stained with Evans blue and DAPI. The image of the
  full plate is presented. (B) Colonies were observed in bright field using inverted
  microscope observed 4× objective on a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. (C) Phosphorylation
  analysis of MET signalling pathway by Western blot on HeLa cell lysates after stimulation
  with semi-log dilution (0.3–30 nM) of K1K1, K1K1S2, or K1KS4 for 10 min. Loading
  controls are based on total MET, total Akt, and total ERK present in each lane.Source
  data are available for this figure.
