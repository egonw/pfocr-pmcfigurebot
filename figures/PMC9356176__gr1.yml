caption: 'DS is associated with CBS and 3-MST overexpression in human dermal fibroblasts.
  (A) & (B): Protein expression of the H2S-producing enzymes – CBS and 3-MST, and
  of the H2S-catabolizing enzymes ETHE1, SQR, and TST, as quantified by immunoblotting.
  β-actin served as loading control for densitometry. (C): Representative images of
  the fluorescent signal of the H2S-specific probe, AzMC along with (D) its quantification
  under baseline (untreated) conditions and following 24-h treatment with 3 μM AOAA.
  (E): Quantification of cellular H2S levels using a second H2S probe, P3. (F): Correlation
  between CBS and 3-MST enzyme expression patterns in DS. Each line and bar graph
  represents the mean ± SEM of n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8 DS
  fibroblasts. C1–C8 and D1-D8 corresponds to the specific donors listed in . Dotted
  connecting lines in the bar graphs indicate the same cell from a specific donor
  with/without AOAA treatment. **p ≤ 0.01 DSC indicates significant differences between
  untreated vs. CC untreated; ##p ≤ 0.01 indicates significant differences between
  DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated. The immunoblot for 3-MST along with the corresponding
  loading control has been previously published [] and is reused with permission and
  according to the Open Access Policy of the journal.'
