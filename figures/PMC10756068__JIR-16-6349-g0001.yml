caption: The protective effect of Inonotus obliquus on the kidney is described. In
  CKD-induced rats, I. obliquus treatment suppresses the expression of pro-fibrotic
  proteins such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), connective tissue growth
  factor (C-TGF), hydroxyproline, collagen type I and fibronectin in renal tissue,
  thus restraining high glucose-induced cell proliferation and fibronectin expression
  in glomerular mesangial cells by inhibiting ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways. Besides,
  I. obliquus helps suppress the expression level of the TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway.
