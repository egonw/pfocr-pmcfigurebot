caption: As a key effector of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, ARL4C regulates
  EMT in ccRCC. (a–c) Western blot of the expression of ARL4C, β-catenin, cyclin D1,
  and c-myc proteins in 786-O and ACHN cells after adding Wnt agonist 1. (d-f) 786-O
  and ACHN cells were cultured with and without Wnt agonist 1 (Wnt agonist 1+/−),
  and ARL4C was then knocked down or not knocked down again (si-ARL4C/si-NC), followed
  by western blotting to determine the expression of ARL4C and β-catenin. (g-i) Expression
  of ARL4C, Wnt pathway-related proteins (β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc), and EMT-related
  proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) following knockdown of ARL4C in
  786-O and ACHN cells. The above quantitative analysis of protein expression was
  normalized relative to β-actin levels. ∗P < 0.05∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001.
