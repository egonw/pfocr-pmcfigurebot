figure_title: Sphingolipid analysis in wild-type Drosophila tissues
caption: '(A) De novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. De novo sphingolipid biosynthetic
  pathway begins with condensation of an amino acid serine and a fatty acid, lauryl-CoA
  into 3KDS by SPT complex in the membranes of ER. 3KDS is reduced to dihydrosphingosine
  by 3KDS reductase. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated to produce dihydroceramide by
  Schlank. Dihydroceramide is desaturated by Δ4 desaturase (DES1) resulting in the
  formation of ceramide. Ceramide acts as a precursor for the biosynthesis of complex
  sphingolipids both in the ER and Golgi complex. Ceramide is actively transported
  to Golgi by CERT. In the trans Golgi lumen, ceramide is converted to hexosylceramides
  by GC synthases and to CPE by CPE synthase. (B-D) Sphingolipids were extracted from
  wild type male and female heads and dissected ovaries and testes using Methanol:Chloroform
  method and subjected to SFC/MS/MS. WTHM, WTHF, WTOY, and WTTS. Sphingolipids were
  quantitated by measuring large fragments in MRM, and average amounts from 3 independent
  biological replicates are shown as picomoles (pmol) in 100 micrograms of carbon.
  Each sphingolipid species (CPE (1B), Ceramide (1C) and HexCer (1D)) was further
  subdivided into 5 major subspecies. Each of the subspecies differed in acyl chain
  length but similar in chemical properties: DHSPH base linked to SFA (DHSPH_SFA),
  SPH base linked to SFA (SPH_SFA), SPH base linked to MUFA (SPH_MUFA), SPH base linked
  to PUFA (2–6 double bonds) (SPH_PUFA), and SPD with SFA (SPD_SFA). (E) Cartoon showing
  the chemical structure of 3 major CPE subspecies including CPE_SPH_SFA, CPE_SPH_MUFA,
  and CPE_SPD_SFA. (F) CPE subspecies within CPE_SPH_SFA that differed in number of
  carbon atoms in acyl chains of sphingosine base and fatty acid. (G) CPE subspecies
  within CPE_SPH_MUFA. (H) CPE subspecies within CPE_SPD_SFA. Statistical significance
  was calculated using mean, SD, and N in Prism 8. The 2-way ANOVA multiple comparison
  was used to calculate p-values where **** p ≤ 0.0001, *** p ≤ 0.001, ** p ≤ 0.01,
  * p ≤ 0.05, and ns p >0.05. Three independent biological replicates were performed
  for each sample and lipids were extracted from 400 heads or 250 pairs of ovaries
  or testes for each biological replicate. The data underlying the graphs shown in
  this figure can be found in . 3KDS, 3-ketodihydrosphinganine; CERT, ceramide transfer
  protein; CPE, ceramide phosphoethanolamine; DHSPH, dihydrosphingosine; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SD,
  standard deviation; SFA, saturated fatty acid; SPD, sphingadiene; SPH, sphingosine;
  SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; WTHF, wild-type heads from female; WTHM, wild-type
  heads from male; WTOY, wild-type ovary; WTTS, wild-type testis.'
