caption: 'Inhibition of AMPK suppresses resveratrol (RSV)-mediated autophagy and apoptosis.
  Cells were treated with or without Cpd. C, in the presence or absence of 80 μM RSV
  for 48 h. (A) Protein expression of p-AMPK, AMPK, and ACTB as determined by Western
  blot; (B) Protein expression of p-mTOR, mTOR, and ACTB as determined by Western
  blot; (C) Transcriptional expression of BECLIN 1 as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB
  was used as an internal control; (D) AO (1 μg/mL) staining of autophagic vesicles.
  Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry (APC); (E) QRT-PCR analysis
  of BAX mRNA. ACTB was used as an internal control; (F) TUNEL-FITC/PI staining was
  used to detect the percentage of apoptotic cells. The data are presented as mean
  ± SD from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with
  the control group. # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared with RSV group.'
