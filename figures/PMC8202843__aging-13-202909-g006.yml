caption: 'Gene set enrichment analyses were performed using gene expression data of
  226 African-American women with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (A) Genes
  are enriched in PLK1 pathway. (B) Genes are enriched in Fisher G2-M cell cycle.
  (C) Genes are enriched in the Reactome cell cycle mitotic. (D) Genes are enriched
  in Reactome cell cycle. False discovery rate (FDR) q value, normalized enrichment
  score (NES), and P values are shown, vs: versus.'
article_title: The lncRNA GATA3-AS1/miR-495-3p/CENPU axis predicts poor prognosis
  of breast cancer via the PLK1 signaling pathway.
