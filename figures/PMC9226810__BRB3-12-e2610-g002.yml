caption: 'TGFB‐induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2) regulates the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway
  in autism. (a) Signaling pathways enriched by the differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in the GSE36315 dataset analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA);
  (b) levels of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway‐related proteins Wnt1, β‐catenin, and c‐Myc
  in the mouse brain tissues examined by western blot analysis; (c) nuclear translocation
  of β‐catenin in mouse temporal cortex tissues examined by immunofluorescence staining;
  (d) luciferase activity in 293T cells after TGIF2 overexpression examined by the
  dual‐luciferase reporter assay. Triplicated wells were set for each experiment.
  Data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Differences between groups were analyzed by
  the unpaired t test, one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or two‐way ANOVA. **p < .01
  vs. NC group; ##p < .01 vs. the AAV9‐NC group'
article_title: Downregulation of TGIF2 is possibly correlated with neuronal apoptosis
  and autism‐like symptoms in mice.
