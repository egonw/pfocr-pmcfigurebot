caption: The Reactome pathway enrichment analysis of genes upregulated in cells produced
  mutant forms of uS10wt. Top significantly affected pathways are listed. The color
  of the dots corresponds to the value of p. adj, and their size is determined by
  the number of genes related to the respective pathway (map color keys, along with
  dot size ones, are shown on the right).
