caption: 'The optimal dose of JWYHD (400 μg/ml) intervened in the BMSCs, which were
  treated with Noggin (100 ng/ml), and both the cell phenotype and protein expression
  were detected. (a) ARS (Magnification: 1×), ALPS (Scale bar: 200 μm), ORS (Scale
  bar: 200 μm), and CFU (Magnification: 1×). (b) The expression of osteogenic and
  adipogenic proteins was measured by WB after culturing for 1 week. (c) The matrix
  mineralization area of ARS. (d) The area of ALPS. (e) The lipidation area of ORS.
  (f) The area of CFU. (g)-(k) The quantitative measurement of protein expression
  (BMP2, P-SMAD1/5/8, RUNX2, OCN, and PPARγ). The data were represented as mean ± SD
  (n = 3), P < 0.05 were considered as a significant difference: ∗ VS. CTRL group,
  #VS. JWYHD (400 μg/ml) group.'
