caption: 'The effect of OBB on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in 5-FU-induced IM
  mice. (a) Representative western blotting band, (b) TLR4, (c) MYD88, (d) IRAK-1,
  (e) the p-IκBα/IκBα ratio, and (f) the p-p65/p65 ratio. The results were expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 3). ##P < 0.01 vs. the control group; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs. the 5-FU group; &P < 0.05 and &&P < 0.01vs. the BBR group.'
