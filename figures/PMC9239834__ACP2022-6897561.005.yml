caption: 'Inhibition of p53 signaling pathway eliminates the effect of UPK3A knockdown
  on gastric cancer cells. (a) The protein expression of UPK3A in SNU-216 and HGC-27
  cells was detected by western blot assay. (b) The protein expression of p-p53, KLF4,
  ZMAT3, MDM2, and SP1 in SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by Western blot assay.
  (c) The cell activity of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was analyzed by MTT assay. (d,
  e) The cell proliferation of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was analyzed by colony formation
  assay. (f, g) The cell migration of SNU-216 and HGC-27 cells was detected by wound
  healing assay. (h, i) The cell invasion of SNU-216 was measured by Transwell assay.
