caption: 'Analysis of metabolic content in the rat serum of groups 1–6. (A) PCA of
  the biological pathway according to the metabolic differences. Each point represented
  a component. (B–C): PCA of the distribution of the 25 functional components we screened.
  (D) Analysis of the biological pathway according to the metabolic differences. Pathways
  associated with PPARγ (VE-related metabolism and fatty acid metabolism) are indicated.'
