caption: 'MiR-195-5p targets FOSL1 and regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to inhibit
  the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBC Cells. (A) CCK-8 assays were used
  to examine cell viability of stable GBC-SD cell lines after transfection and treating
  with DMSO or PNU-74654. (B) Wound healing assays were shown in stable GBC-SD cell
  lines after transfection and treating with DMSO or PNU-74654. Cell migration was
  observed using a microscope (original magnification, ×100). (C) Transwell assays
  were used to detect cell invasion capacities of stable GBC-SD cell lines after transfection
  and treating with DMSO or PNU-74654 (dyeing with crystal violet; original magnification,
  ×200). (D) Flow cytometry was used to assess the cell cycle distribution of stable
  GBC-SD cell lines after transfection and treating with DMSO or PNU-74654 for 24
  h and stained with PI. Data are mean ± SD. *P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + oe-NC
  + DMSO group; #P<0.05 compared with NC-mimic + oe-FOSL1 + DMSO group; &P<0.05 compared
  with miR-195-5p mimic + oe-FOSL1 + DMSO group. The experiment was repeated 3 times.
  oe-NC, overexpress negative control; oe-FOSL1, overexpress Fos-like antigen-1; GBC,
  gallbladder cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PI, propidium
  iodide; SD, standard deviation.'
