caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of AD-related DEGs. (A) The circle graph shows
  the AD-related DEGs enriched in the top5 GO categories of BPs. (B) The circle graph
  shows the AD-related DEGs enriched in the top5 GO categories of CCs. (C) The circle
  graph shows the AD-related DEGs enriched in the top5 GO categories of MFs. The yellow
  dots represent the GO categories, the color of the line delivered by a dot indicates
  the category of the dot in the legend, the size of a dot indicates the number of
  the genes included. (D) The dot plot shows the AD-related DEGs enriched in the top5
  KEGG pathways.
