caption: Nur77 inhibits the activation of NF‐κB by downregulating the expression of
  IKK‐β during osteoclast differentiation. (A) The protein levels of IKK‐β. (B) The
  protein levels of NF‐κB and p‐NF‐κB. (C‐H) The mRNA levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, Car2,
  ACP5, Ctsk and NFATC1. All data are presented as boxplots with median and interquartile
  range and were statistically assessed by one‐way analysis followed by the Bonferroni
  test. p < 0.001
