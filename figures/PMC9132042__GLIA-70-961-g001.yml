caption: Postsynaptic K+ efflux enhances intersynaptic crosstalk. (a) A schematic
  showing the position of two stimulating (SC stim 1 and SC stim 2) and one recording
  (Reg) electrodes. Stimulating electrodes were placed to activate two parallel pathways
  of Schaffer collaterals. EPSPs were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons. (b) The
  test on pathway independence. Left, sample traces of conditioned EPSP (EPSP in one
  pathway [stim 1] was preceded by EPSP in the other pathway [stim 2]) and unconditioned
  EPSP in response to stim 1 only. Right, a ratio of conditioned EPSP (stim 1 after
  stim 2) versus nonconditioned EPSP (stim 1 only) in pathway 1 (path 1) and a ratio
  of conditioned EPSP (stim 2 after stim 1) versus nonconditioned EPSP (stim 2 only)
  in pathway 2 (path 2). (c) Examples of two pathway recordings with KMS‐(left) and
  NMDG‐based (right) internal solutions. Gray bar ‐ application of MK‐801, activity‐dependent
  channel blocker of NMDARs. Replacement of intracellular K+ for NMDG reduced the
  blockade of the silent pathway during stimulation of the active pathway. This points
  to reduced glutamate spillover. (d) The summary plot showing EPSP reduction in the
  silent pathway. The EPSPs were normalized to their baseline amplitude. The reduction
  was significantly larger when the postsynaptic cell was filled with K+. The data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. ns p > .05, *p < .05, two‐sample t test
