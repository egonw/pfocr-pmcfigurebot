caption: CTC binds to NF-κB and actives the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway in 5
  dpf zebrafish offspring. (A) Molecular modeling indicates CTC binding to NFκB1,
  NFκB2, and NFκB3 by Molegro Virtual Docker software X7. The mRNA expression levels
  of nfκb1, nfκb 2, and nfκb3 (B) and related genes (C). (D) Protein level of nfκb3
  by western blot was significantly induced in F1 larvae in response to parental exposure
  to CTC. (E) CTC levels (ng/g) in F0 female ovary, F0 male testis, F1 embryos, and
  F2 embryos after F0 exposure to CTC. *P < 0.05, by one-way ANOVA with LSD’s test.
  Error bars indicate the s.e.m. B, n = 4; C, n = 4; D, n = 3; and E, n = 8.
