caption: Trdmt1 deletion leads to impaired response after LPS treatment in rats. A,
  The relative expression of Trdmt1 in LPS‐treated rats in heart, liver, spleen, lung,
  kidney, brain, thymus, small intestine, and bone marrow tissues (n = 3). B, Survival
  curve of Trdmt1 knockout rats after 5 mg/kg LPS treatment (n = 10). C, Lung wet/dry
  weight ratio of Trdmt1 knockout rats after 5 mg/kg LPS treatment (n ≥ 3). D, Representative
  images of HE staining of lung, liver, kidney, and spleen from Trdmt1 knockout rats
  with 1 mg/kg LPS or PBS treatment. In liver, labels indicate vacuolization of liver
  lobules (yellow arrow), infiltration of inflammatory cells (blue arrow), nuclei
  color change (red arrow), bleeding (green arrow), and hepatocyte degeneration (black
  arrow) in LPS‐treated groups; in lung tissue, labels indicate alveolar congestion
  (yellow arrow), alveolar hemorrhage (blue arrow), neutrophil infiltration (red arrow),
  and thickness of alveolar wall/hyaline membrane formation (green arrow) in LPS‐treated
  groups; in spleen tissue, labels indicate extramedullary hematopoietic foci (yellow
  arrow), splenic corpuscle in red pulp (blue arrow), and marginal zone thinning (red
  arrow) in LPS‐treated groups; in kidney, labels indicate vacuolization (yellow arrow),
  dilatation of renal tubules (blue arrow), neutrophil infiltration (red arrow), degeneration
  of renal tubules (green arrow), and tubular thickening (black arrow) in LPS‐treated
  groups. Scale bars, 50 μm. (E) Lung injury score of Trdmt1 knockout rats after 1 mg/kg
  LPS treatment (n = 20). WT, wild‐type rats; KO, Trdmt1 knockout rats. Mean ± SEM;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
