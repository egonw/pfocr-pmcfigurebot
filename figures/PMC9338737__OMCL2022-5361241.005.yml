caption: 'Erastin and vitamin C increase the intracellular ferrous iron level. (a,
  b) The intracellular ferrous iron level was detected by an iron assay kit in PaTu8988
  and BxPC3 cell lines under treatment with erastin and vitamin C. (c, d) Flow cytometry
  was performed to measure ferrous iron levels, and the quantification of fluorescence
  intensity is shown (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001). (e, f) Heat map and volcano map analyses
  showed differentially expressed genes in response to erastin and vitamin C treatment
  measured by RNA-seq, respectively. Blue: low expression levels. Red: high expression
  levels.'
