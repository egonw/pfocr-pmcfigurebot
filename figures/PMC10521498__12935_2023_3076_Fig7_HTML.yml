caption: Activating TGF-β signaling pathway reversed si-DIO3OS-induced the attenuation
  of cell migration, invasion in osteosarcoma cells. A Inhibited DIO3OS expression
  repressed the activation of TGF-β signaling pathway in SaoS-2 cells. B Inhibited
  DIO3OS expression repressed the activation of TGF-β signaling pathway in U2OS cells.
  C TGF-β1 reversed si-DIO3OS-induced the attenuation of TGF-β signaling pathway in
  SaoS-2 cells. D Activating TGF-β signaling pathway reversed si-DIO3OS-induced the
  attenuation of cell migration, invasion in SaoS-2 cells using Transwell assays.
  The scale bar were marked in red, 100 μm. E TGF-β1 revised si-DIO3OS-induced the
  promoted expression of E-cad and inhibited expression of vimentin in SaoS-2 cells.
  F Activating TGF-β signaling pathway reversed si-DIO3OS-induced the attenuation
  of cell migration in SaoS-2 cells using wound healing assay.P-value of less than
  0.05 is considered statistically significant (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001)
