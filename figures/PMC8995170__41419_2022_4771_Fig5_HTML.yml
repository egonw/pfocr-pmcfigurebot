figure_title: Graphical summary of major findings of this study on the TLR9-IL-12p40-iNOS
  signaling pathway in the EV71-induced brainstem encephalitis
caption: Severe EV71 infection induces an acute IL-12p40 response through intracellular
  sensor TLR9 in glia cells of the brainstem, subsequently generating neurotoxic NO
  causing encephalitis. These findings provide support for the therapeutic value of
  blocking the TLR9 mediated IL-12p40 response in the treatment of severe EV71 infection-induced
  brainstem encephalitis.
