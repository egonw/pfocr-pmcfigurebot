caption: '(A) Diagram of chromosomal deletioninsertion mutation of ΔPmurA: substitution
  of a tightly regulated araC ParaBAD cassette with the wild-type promoter of E. piscicida
  murA gene, resulting in arabinose-regulated murA expression. (B) Wild-type murA
  and ΔPmurA promoter region sequence: promoter of murA gene (57 bp) was deleted and
  replaced by araC ParaBAD cassette. Modified Shine–Dalgarno sequence is represented
  in red. (C) Genotype verification of ΔPmurA (χ16016). (D) Schematic illustration
  of arabinose regulation of chromosomal expression of murA gene. (E) Mechanisms of
  E. piscicida lysis systems: schematic representation of arabinose-dependent ΔPmurA
  (χ16016) cell wall synthesis. (F) Model of bacterial call wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis
  pathway; MurA catalyzes first step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. (G) Phenotypic
  characterization of ΔPmurA180::TT araC ParaBAD murA (χ16016) in presence or absence
  of arabinose in LB agar plates. (H) Growth curves for J118 and χ16016 in presence
  or absence of arabinose.'
