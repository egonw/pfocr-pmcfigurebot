figure_title: Phenolic profiling of SCOP lines and WT
caption: (A) Average ion intensities of scopoletin and its glucoside scopolin. For
  each compound, the average ion intensity was significantly higher in SCOP lines
  as compared to WT (P < 0.001, ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey test; n = 9; error
  bars represent the SE). (B) Principal components analysis of the phenolic profile
  of SCOP-1, SCOP-2, and WT lines. PC, principal component. Venn diagrams represent
  the 95% confidence regions of all detected m/z features. (C) Overview of all (partially)
  characterized differential metabolites.
article_title: Overexpression of the scopoletin biosynthetic pathway enhances lignocellulosic
  biomass processing.
