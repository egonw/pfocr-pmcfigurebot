caption: 'Relevant pathways identified using the central carbon metabolism dataset
  in nasal washes collected from ferrets. The red-colored circles represent significantly
  relevant pathways, while the white circles represent the non-significant pathways.
  Noting, 1: Pentose phosphate pathway, 2: Pentose and glucuronate interconversions,
  3: Arginine biosynthesis, 4: Starch and sucrose metabolism, 5: D-Glutamine and D-glutamate
  metabolism, 6: Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, 7: Citrate cycle (TCA
  cycle), 8: Butanoate metabolism, 9: Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis,
  10: Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, 11: Phenylalanine, tyrosine and
  tryptophan biosynthesis, and 12: Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.'
