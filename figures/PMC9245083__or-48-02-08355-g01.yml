caption: 'Differential gene expression in biological replicates of imatinib resistance.
  (A) Venn diagrams of differentially expressed genes in each subline and (B) in the
  overlap of both replicates of imatinib resistance compared with native K-562. Numbers
  indicate differentially expressed genes comparing native cells to lowIM and highIM.
  (C) GoPlot of significantly enriched KEGG pathways with differentially expressed
  genes in imatinib resistance shown for replicate 1, replicate 2 of imatinib resistance,
  as well as the combined analysis of both replicates (overlap) displaying the gene
  expression fold changes (logFC) and the z-score of the pathway prediction to indicate
  the direction of the overall changes. lowIM: 0.5 µM imatinib resistant; highIM:
  2 µM imatinib resistant; R1: resistant subline 1; R2: resistant subline 2.'
