caption: Filariae regulate pattern recognition receptors signaling for their survival.
  Filarial glycoproteins such as ES-62 (A) form complexes with Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR) on monocytes, followed by their internalization and sequestration with protein
  kinase C-α and (B) down-regulate TLR4-associated protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) in dendritic
  cells, followed by sequestration of p62 and LC3. As a result, sequestered components
  are degraded by autophagolysosomes, inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and inflammatory cell polarization. (C) Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibits
  the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, prevents inflammasome activation, and induces alternatively
  activated macrophages (AAM) activation, which is characterized by an increase in
  anti-inflammatory IL-10 synthesis and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.
