figure_title: Transcriptomic data, analyzed using the RLQ analysis, reveals genes
  and metabolic pathways with expression associated with the ability to produce surfactants
  in glycerol minimal media
caption: '(A) RLQ provides a way to analyze simultaneously associations from three
  tables. The results reveal not only the genes (B) but also the pathways (C) whose
  expression is associated with the rhamnolipid phenotype. The insets in both (B)
  and (C) represent the surfactant secretion phenotype (assessed in glycerol) in the
  two principal RLQ axes. Genes and pathways align with the direction of each phenotypic
  category: in panel (C), the top five pathways (‘pau’ are KEGG pathway IDs) associated
  with each phenotype are highlighted in black. The five-digit number in panel (C)
  represents the PA14 locus ID.'
