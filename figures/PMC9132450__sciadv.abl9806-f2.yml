figure_title: SEMA3 inhibits cell growth via the Hippo pathway
caption: (A) SEMA3B and SEMA3F induce YAP phosphorylation. Conditioned media (cm-S3A,
  cm-S3B, and cm-S3F) were used to treat U87-MG, HEK293A, NCI-H1792, and NCI-H1299
  cells. YAP phosphorylation was detected by phos-tag gel. (B) LATS1/2 deletion blocks
  YAP phosphorylation by SEMA3A. U87-MG cells were infected with lentiviral CRISPR
  sgRNA (single guide RNA) constructs (sgLATS1/2), and deletions of LATS1 and LATS2
  were detected by Western blots. Cells were treated with a control or SEMA3A-conditioned
  medium. w/o, without any conditioned medium added. (C) Deletion of LATS1/2 blocks
  SEMA3A-induced YAP cytoplasmic translocation in HEK293A cells. Scale bars, 25 Î¼m.
  (D) ANKRD1 and CTGF transcription repression by SEMA3A requires LATS. Quantitative
  real-time PCR analyses were performed with SEMA3A-treated WT and LATS1/2 dKO U87-MG
  cells. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ns, not significant. (E) LATS1/2 deletion compromises
  SEMA3A-regulated transcriptome. Principal components analysis of the RNA-seq data
  of the WT and LATS1/2 KO U87-MG cells treated with or without rSEMA3A. PC, principal
  component. (F) A two-way (genotype and treatment) DESeq2 analysis of SEMA3-treated
  WT and LATS1/2 dKO cells showed that a substantial portion (36.4%) of genes regulated
  by the SEMA3 treatment is LATS1/2 dependent. (G) Hippo pathway mediates SEMA3 effects
  on biological functions such as cytoskeleton organization and wound healing. Metascape
  analysis of LATS-dependent SEMA3 target genes (F, red slice) was performed.
