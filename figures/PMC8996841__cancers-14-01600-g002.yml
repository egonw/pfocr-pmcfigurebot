caption: Migratory CLL cells harvested from our in vitro circulating system upregulate
  the FAK signaling pathway in comparison to CLL circulatory cells. (A) RNA-seq differential
  expression overlayed on a FAK signaling pathway Cytoscape network. (B) Heatmap of
  14 differentially upregulated FAK signaling pathway genes from migratory CLL cells.
  (C) For validation, FAK gene expression from the RNA-seq data (n = 10) was compared
  to the qPCR data (n = 4) as assessed by a TaqMan assay.
