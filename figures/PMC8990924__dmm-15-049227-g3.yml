caption: Proteomic analysis highlights several pathways associated with neuroprotection
  from ACE-I treatment. (A) Significant changes in protein expression levels in the
  heads (n=5) of ramipril (left, green)- and quinapril (right, orange)-treated larvae
  when compared to DMSO controls. (B,C) Functional annotation performed using Database
  for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) identified gene ontology,
  protein pathway and functional category similarities, and the top ten upregulated
  pathways (top) and downregulated pathways (bottom), compared to total background
  detection for ramipril (B) and quinapril (C). Classification stringency set to ‘medium’,
  similarity threshold=0.5. Bars represent enrichment score and points (•) are the
  number of proteins detected in that pathway. P-values are presented.
