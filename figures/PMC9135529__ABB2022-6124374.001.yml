caption: Conditioned medium (CM) extracted from SW480-resistant colon cancer cells
  enhance angiogenesis. HUVECs treated with CM of SW480/oxaliplatin and SW480 cells.
  (a) Proliferation assay of HUVECs. (b) The Transwell assay determined the HUVECs
  migration. (c) Photomicrographs of tube-like structures and quantification of the
  tube number. (d) The mRNA level of VEGF and CD31. (e) Then, protein expression of
  CD31 and VEGF in HUVECs. All above experiments were repeatedly performed 3 times;
  data are shown as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
