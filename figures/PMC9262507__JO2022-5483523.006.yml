caption: 'Silencing of VASP inactivates the Rap1 signaling pathway in BC cells. (a)
  VASP-related gene interaction network. Each circle represents a gene, and the lines
  between the circles indicate the correlation between genes. (b) KEGG enrichment
  analysis of VASP-related genes. The abscissa represents GeneRatio, and the ordinate
  indicates KEGG entry identifier; each circle represents the number of genes enriched
  in an entry identifier, and the histogram on the right is the color scale. (c) Western
  blot analysis of Rap1-GTP/total Rap1 ratio in MCF-7/ADR, MCF-7/S, and MCF-10A cells.
  ∗p < 0.05, compared with MCF-10A cells. #p < 0.05, compared with MCF-7/S cells.
  (d) RT-qPCR detection of VASP expression patterns in MCF-7/ADR cells with si-VASP.
  (e) RT-qPCR detection of VASP expression patterns in MCF-7/S cells with overexpression
  of VASP. (f) Western blot analysis of VASP protein expression patterns in MCF-7/ADR
  cells with si-VASP. (g) Western blot analysis of VASP protein expression patterns
  in MCF-7/S cells with overexpression of VASP. (h) Western blot analysis of Rap1-GTP/total
  Rap1 ratio in MCF-7/ADR cells with si-VASP. (i) Western blot analysis of Rap1-GTP/total
  Rap1 ratio in MCF-7/S cells with overexpression of VASP. In panels (d), (f), and
  (h) ∗p < 0.05, compared with MCF-7/ADR treated with si-NC. In panels (e), (g), and
  (i) ∗p < 0.05, compared with MCF-7/S treated with oe-NC. Data are shown as mean ± standard
  deviation of three technical replicates.'
