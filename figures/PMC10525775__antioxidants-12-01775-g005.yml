caption: Formation of H2O2 is an essential factor for genotoxicity of P-AscH− against
  NSCLC. (A) Catalase prevents loss of Chk1 and RPA2; and inhibits formation of p-Chk1,
  p-RPA2, and γ-H2AX. Cells were co-treated with P-AscH− (4 mM) and bovine catalase
  (200 U/mL) for 1 h, then the changes in DNA damage response pathway were determined
  at 6 h post-treatment with Western blot analyses. Data are representative of three
  independent studies. (B) The density of each blot was estimated and subsequently
  normalized to loading control GAPDH. The values were expressed as fold change relative
  to the untreated control (n = 3; mean ± SEM; * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p <
  0.0001 vs. untreated control; ††† p < 0.001, †††† p < 0.0001 vs. P-AscH−).
