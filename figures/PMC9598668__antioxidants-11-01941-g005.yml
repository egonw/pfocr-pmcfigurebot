caption: CRHF2 protects HaCaT keratinocytes from PM-stimulated apoptosis by inhibiting
  apoptotic proteins. Experiments were triplicated (n = 3). Results are represented
  as mean Â± SD; ** p < 0.01. (# denotes significance compared to control while * represents
  significance compared to PM-treated group).
