caption: 'Effect of quercetin macroparticles and nanoparticles on the expression of
  key proteins involved in the EMT process and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Expression
  levels of proteins were determined by Western blotting. Twist1 and Snail decrease
  their expression in the groups treated with QMPs and especially in the groups treated
  with QNPs in a dose-dependent manner, while Smad7 increases its expression in the
  higher dose of QMPs and in all doses of QNPs. EMT: Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition.
  Mean ± SD (n = 3); ### p < 0.001, #### p < 0.0001 compared to the Control group;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared to the Ad group.'
