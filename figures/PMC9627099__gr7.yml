caption: Kyn activated NRF2 through AhR signaling. (A) Macrophages were pretreated
  with CH-223191 (CH, 20 μM) for 2 h before the addition of Kyn to the culture for
  24 h. The mRNA levels of AhR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and NRF2 were measured by RT-qPCR.
  (B) The total protein levels of NRF2 and AhR were detected by western blotting.
  (C) The nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels of AhR in macrophages were detected
  by western blotting. (D) The nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels of NRF2 in macrophages
  were detected by western blotting. (E) (a) The location of the gene sequence of
  NFE2L2 (also known as NRF2) on chromosome 2. (b) The locations of the binding sites
  were upstream of the TSS. (F) ChIP-qPCR analysis of the interaction between AhR
  and the NRF2 promoter. (G) A schematic overview of IDO-mediated ASC regulation on
  macrophages in periodontitis. TSS, transcription start site; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  ASC, adipose-derived stromal/stem cells.

  stromal/stem cells in experimental periodontitis by modulating macrophages through
  the kynurenine-AhR-NRF2 pathway.
