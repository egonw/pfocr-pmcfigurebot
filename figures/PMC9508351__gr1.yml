caption: The significantly differentially expressed genes and proteins in chick kidneys
  between the FFC treatment group and the control group. (A) The number of significantly
  differentially expressed genes. (B) Cluster heat map of differentially expressed
  genes. (C) Volcano map of differentially expressed genes. (D) The number of significantly
  differentially expressed proteins. (E) Cluster heat map of differentially expressed
  proteins. (F) Volcano map of differentially expressed proteins. (In FigureC and
  F, the two vertical dashed lines are the thresholds for the expression of multiple
  of difference, the horizontal dashed line represents the threshold of significance
  level.)
