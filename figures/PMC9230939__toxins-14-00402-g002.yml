caption: Schematic illustration of the remote metabolite sensing and signaling pathway
  as an effective OAT1 regulation mechanism to maintain plasma indoxyl sulfate levels
  by controlling their secretion. Proximal tubule cells in kidneys sense elevated
  uremic toxin levels through epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and down-stream
  signaling to induce their secretion by upregulating the organic anion transporter
  1 (OAT1) via AhR and EGFR signaling, controlled by miR-223. Concomitantly produced
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) control OAT1 activity, balanced by the glutathione
  pathway, as confirmed by cellular metabolomic profiling (from []).
