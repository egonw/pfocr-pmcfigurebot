caption: Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis and prediction of response to chemotherapy.
  (a) Different activated pathways between high-AutS and low-AutS groups. (b) Comparison
  of susceptibility to cisplatin, docetaxel and bicalutamide among two groups. IC50
  was set as the efficacy evaluation indicator. High IC50 represented a bad efficacy.
  (c) Decreased AutS in LNCaP cells after treatment with bicalutamide and decreased
  AutS in PCa cells after treatment with enzalutamide. Gene expression data of bicalutamide-treated
  LNCaP cells was from GSE150475. Gene expression data of enzalutamide-treated PCa
  cells was from GSE69249 datasets. The label “DMSO” on the X axis represented the
  control groups, and the labels “Bicalutamide” and “enzalutamide” represented the
  treatment groups.
