caption: 'Summary scheme showing the significantly changed central metabolites under
  cold, drought, flooding, heat, and salinity stress. The letter below each metabolite
  indicates that the metabolite is significantly changed under the specific stress.
  Depicted data are extracted from published studies shown in . Abbreviations: 2PG:
  2-phosphoglycolate; 3PGA: 3-phosphoglyceric acid; 6PG: 6-Phosphogluconate; ADP Glucose:
  adenosine diphosphate glucose; AMP: Adenosine monophosphate; CBC: the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  cycle; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; G1P: glucose-1-phosphate; G6P: glucose-6-phosphate;
  GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid; Gly3P: Glycerol 3-phosphate; GSH: reduced glutathione;
  OPPP: the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; R5P: ribose-5-phosphate;
  RUBP: ribulose-1,5-bisophosphate; TCA: the tricarboxylic acid cycle; UDP Glucose:
  uridine diphosphate glucose.'
