caption: 'Major pathways related to induced disease resistance of table grapes. (A):
  Plantâ€“pathogen interaction pathway, (B): Plant MAPK signaling pathway, (C): Plant
  hormone signal transduction pathway, (D): Pathway of glutathione metabolism, (E):
  Pathway of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, and (F): Pathway
  of flavonoid biosynthesis. The genes with the red color are all up-regulated, the
  genes with the green color are all down-regulated, and the genes with the blue color
  are mix-regulated.'
