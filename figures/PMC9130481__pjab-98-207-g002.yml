caption: (A) Receptor-mediated endocytosis of yolk components. Yolk components secreted
  from the intestine are endocytosed by the growing oocytes. RME-2 is a yolk receptor
  that is recycled between the plasma membrane and endosomes to deliver yolk components
  to yolk granules in growing oocytes. Many proteins, including RME proteins are involved
  in this process. After fertilization, RME-2 is delivered to lysosomes via the multivesicular
  body (MVB) pathway for degradation. CHC, clathrin heavy chain; PM, plasma membrane.
  (B) Selective degradation of maternal membrane proteins in embryos. Some of the
  maternal membrane proteins (RME-2, CAV-1, CHS-1, and EGG-1) are internalized by
  clathrin-dependent endocytosis and delivered to lysosomes via the MVB pathway. This
  process depends on meiotic cell cycle progression triggered by anaphase-promoting
  complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) such as UBC-13 and
  its variants, UEV-1, are involved in the ubiquitination of maternal membrane proteins.
  By contrast, SNB-1 and SYN-4, which are general factors regulating membrane trafficking,
  remain after fertilization and continue to function in embryos. PM, plasma membrane.
