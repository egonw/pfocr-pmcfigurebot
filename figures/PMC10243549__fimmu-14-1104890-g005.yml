caption: 'sEVs miR-503 targets endothelial IGF1R and inhibits IGF1R expression (A)
  Potential targets of miR-503 were predicted using miRDIP (https://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP/)
  and predicted targets with high scores were applied for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment annotation. (B) HUVECs were
  transfected with miR-503 mimics or miR-503 inhibitors and examined for the protein
  levels of IGF1R were examined using Immunoblotting. (C) Wild- and mutant-type IGF1R
  3’UTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed and co-transduced into tool cells
  (293T) with miR-503 mimics or inhibitor. Luciferase activity was determined. N=3,
  ** p<0.01 vs. mimics NC group. ## p<0.01 vs. inhibitor NC group.'
