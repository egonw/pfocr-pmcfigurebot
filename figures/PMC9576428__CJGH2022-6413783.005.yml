caption: The reversal of CTLs depletion after treatment with TP. After the cells were
  cocultured for one day, different concentrations of tea polyphenols (0, 1, 2.5,
  and 5 μg/mL) were added, and the cells were cultured for an additional day. (a)
  Western blotting analysis of GRP78, PERK, P-PERK, and CHOP expression in CTLL-2 cells.
  (b) Cells were treated with TP (0 and 5 μg/mL), and ER morphology was examined by
  electron microscopy (scale bar = 2 μm). (c) Western blotting and (d) ELISA analysis.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ns indicates no statistical significance.
