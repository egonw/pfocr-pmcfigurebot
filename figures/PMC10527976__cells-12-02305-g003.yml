caption: scRNA-seq identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in distinct leaf
  cell types. (A) The number of DEGs identified in each cluster. (B) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of all DEGs from all clusters. (C) Venn diagram showing the
  804 core DEGs across all clusters. (D,E) Expression matrix of 35 hormone signaling
  DEGs and 32 differentially expressed TFs in each cell cluster. (F) The interaction
  network of 32 differentially expressed TFs. (G) Bar plots illustrating the up- and
  down-regulated DEGs in each cell type. (H) Venn diagram showing the 1649 core-DEGs
  across all cell types. (I) Heatmap depicting the expression level of 65 hub-TFs
  in each cell type of the two varieties. (J,K) The expression distribution of four
  LOG genes in all cell clusters, with the gray dots as background representing the
  cells with no expression of the given transcript. (L) Dot plots show the expression
  pattern and distribution of four LOG genes in distinct cell types. (M) A putative
  model illustrating that the down-regulation of LOG in Yueyou271 leads to a decrease
  in cytokinin content.
