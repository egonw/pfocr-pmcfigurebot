caption: 'Effect of sodium selenite in H2 O2 -stimulated osteoblasts. A. Sodium selenite
  (3.2 μM) was pretreated to osteoblasts for 24 hours, and after that, H2 O2 (100
  μM) was treated for 48 hours. After 48 hours of incubation, ALP activity was analyzed.
  B. The osteogenic markers protein level was detected after 48 hours of sodium selenite
  (3.2 μM) treatment. To normalize the densitometry of western blot bands, β-actin
  was used as a loading control. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. Similar results
  were obtained in three independent experiments. *,#; P≤0.05 compared to the control,
  ##; P≤0.01 compared to the H2 O2 -stimulated osteoblasts, ALP; Alkaline phosphatase,
  and RLU; Relative luminescence units.'
