caption: The benefits of R-Y FMT were correlated with gut microbiota. (A) Heatmap
  of fecal SCFA concentrations; n = 5. (B) Differences in fecal butyrate concentrations
  between the DSS control and R-Y FMT mice; n = 5. (C and D) 16S-rRNA sequencing analysis
  of fecal samples from DSS control and R-Y FMT mice. Shannon and Simpson index analysis
  in each group. (E) PCoA plot from the DSS control and R-Y FMT mice groups based
  on the Bray–Curtis distance; n = 5. (F) Relative abundance of SCFA-producing microbes
  in mice feces; n = 5. (G) M1 macrophage polarization in the RAW264.7 macrophage
  cell line after butyrate treatment for 8 h. (H) Cells were treated with butyrate
  and LPS for 8 h to evaluate M1 macrophage polarization. Scale bars = 100 μm. The
  results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗P < 0.01.
