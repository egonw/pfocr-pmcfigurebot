caption: Functional involvement of Sortilin in AD-related signaling. Sortilin localizes
  in sorting vesicles and on the plasma membrane (PM) in neuronal somas, dendrites
  and axons. Box A) Sortilin undergoes ectodomain shedding by ADAM10/17, which produces
  soluble Sortilin fragments. In humans, C-terminal fragments are found within the
  Aβ plaques, however, their precise origin and trafficking route is unknown (marked
  as “?”). Box B) Sortilin binds BACE1 in TGN and facilitates its intracellular trafficking
  via anterograde and retrograde pathways, the later directed either towards the recycling
  pathway or for the lysosomal degradation. Box C) Sortilin binds APP at PM; however,
  its involvement in APP processing is controversial. Left panel—Sortilin binds APP
  at axonal PM where they undergo internalization. Sortilin either traffics APP for
  its lysosomal degradation (a.) or engages in amyloidogenic pathway by enhancing
  APP cleavage by BACE1 (b.), subsequently causing an increased formation and secretion
  of sAPPβ and Aβ. Sortilin is also a PSEN1/2 substrate. Right panel – Sortilin has
  a neuroprotective role as it mediates the uptake of soluble APP from the extracellular
  space (1.) for lysosomal degradation thus decreasing their extracellular concentration.
  Moreover, Sortilin binds APP in neurites where it drives its preferential cleavage
  by ADAM10/17 (2.), thus elevating sAPPα levels. Consequently, there is less APP
  internalized (3.) prior the sequential cleavage by β- and γ-secretases (4.), resulting
  in decreased production of sAPPβ and Aβ (4.-5.). However, the molecular mechanisms
  are rather unknown (marked with “?”). Box D) Upon proNGF binding, Sortilin forms
  a complex with p75NTR receptor, which mediates pro-apoptotic cell responses (left).
  The presence of AβO increases Sortilin expression, which likely enhances the formation
  and activity of Sortilin-p75NTR complexes. Sortilin-p75.NTR complex binds and internalizes
  AβO leading to increased intracellular neurotoxicity, and later cell death (middle).
  Sortilin can also bind and sequester extracellular ApoE, subsequently facilitating
  its lysosomal degradation, which has a neuroprotective effect (right). It is not
  clear if Sortilin sequesters ApoE-Aβ complexes (marked as “?”)
