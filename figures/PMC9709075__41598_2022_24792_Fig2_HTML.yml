caption: 'Comparison of virus-induced genes between AM and AEC yielded a strong shared
  antiviral response and a set of enriched pathways that was driven by AEC-specific
  genes (A). The top 10 of these pathways as ranked by p value are shown. Exemplary
  candidates from the GO term “Immune Response” show that the lack of virus induced
  genes from this pathway in AM is due to a high basal abundance of these genes. Z-
  scores were calculated on the basis of transcripts per million (TPM) (B). Broad
  lack of relative gene induction in AM was confirmed when investigating all 79 genes
  from this pathway that were part of the AECII-exclusive Venn section (C). Statistical
  significance was assessed by ANOVA with tukey correction for multiple testing. ***p < 0.001.
  Classifications: BP = biological process, CC = cell compartment, MP = molecular
