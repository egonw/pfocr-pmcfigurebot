figure_title: Model requires gap junction regulation with a delay to recapitulate
  difference in ERK-KTR N/C signals between emitter and adjacent receiver cells
caption: '(A) Illustration of simplified intracellular pathway. (B-E) Modeling results
  for simplified intracellular pathway with no feedbacks in an all-emitter monolayer.
  Model is fitted to ERK-KTR N/C data for 6 minute bPAC input pulses applied to an
  all-emitter monolayer (, IBMX, population average). ERK-KTR N/C and cAMP signals
  shifted to zero and scaled for comparison, with the peak of the emitter signal at
  1 and minimum at zero. (B) ERK-KTR N/C signal and predicted cAMP signal driven by
  6 minute bPAC input pulse. We present results for two values of the deactivation
  rate of ERK γerk using the expression κerkγerk where κerk is a scaling factor and
  γerk is a fitted deactivation rate. Top plot: fitted model (κerk = 1). Middle plot:
  same fitted model except for a slower ERK deactivation rate reduced by a factor
  of 2 (κerk = .5). (C) Fitted model results (κerk = 1) for ERK-KTR N/C signal and
  predicted cAMP signal, with and without IBMX. (D) Predicted 40 minute bPAC input
  pulse driven ERK-KTR N/C and cAMP signals (with and without IBMX). Signals shifted
  to zero and normalized for comparison. (E) Modeled cAMP signal (top plot), and with
  PDE inhibitor (IBMX, middle plot). Same signals as in (D) but not zero shifted and
  normalized. (F) Multicellular system to be modeled with 1 emitter (yellow nucleus,
  red label) and receiver cells (light green nuclei, black label). Lines connecting
  nuclei represent direct cell-cell communication through gap-junctions. (G-I) Single-emitter-cluster
  modeling using system in (F): For top two plots, the ERK-KTR N/C and cAMP signals
  are shifted to zero and scaled for comparison, with the peak of the emitter signal
  at 1 and the minimum at zero. The receiver signals are multiplied by the same scaling
  factor as the emitter to maintain the same relative amplitudes (proportionally).
  (G) Results for the simplified intracellular pathway with constant gap junctional
  permeability. (H) Results for the intracellular PKA feedback model through PDE that
  produces overshoot (in all-emitter monolayer) with constant gap junctional permeability.
  (I) Results for the simplified intracellular pathway with cAMP/PKA regulation of
  gap junctions with a delay. Corresponding dynamics of the active gap junctions on
  the emitter/receiver interfaces (averaged) is also included with a breakdown of
  the cAMP/PKA driven contributions from the emitter and the average of the adjacent
  receivers.'
