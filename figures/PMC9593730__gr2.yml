caption: K15-BKO mice demonstrate disturbances in lipid and amino acid metabolic pathways(A)
  Heatmap and k-means clustering of DEGs comparing K15 F/F and K15-BKO BAT at RT (n =
  3).(B) KEGG pathway analysis of downregulated genes in K15-BKO.(C) qPCR of select
  lipid metabolism genes in BAT (n = 6–7).(D) Heatmap depicting circulating acylcarnitine
  levels K15 F/F and K15-BKO at RT, normalized to K15 F/F RT (n = 7).(E) qPCR of BCAA
  catabolism genes in BAT (n = 6–7).(F) Circulating amino acid levels at RT, normalized
  to K15 F/F (n = 6). Data represent mean ± SEM. Comparisons between groups were performed
  using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
