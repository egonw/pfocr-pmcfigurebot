caption: XBP1 regulates macrophage activation in a STING-NLRP3-dependent manner.(A)
  Western blot was performed to analyse the levels of NLRP3 in liver macrophages isolated
  from Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO mice treated with CCl4, BDL, or MCD. Statistical analysis
  was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (B) Western blot was performed to analyse the
  levels of TLR4, p-IRE1α, XBP1, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, pro-caspase-1, cleaved
  IL-1β, and pro-IL-1β in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated with LPS or LPS + ATP.
  Statistical analysis was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (C) Western blot was performed
  to analyse the levels of STING in liver macrophages isolated from Xbp1FL/FL and
  Xbp1M-KO mice treated with CCl4, BDL, or MCD. Statistical analysis was carried out
  using 1-way ANOVA. (D) Western blot was performed to analyse the levels of cGAS,
  STING, p-TBK1, TBK1, p-IRF3, and IRF3 in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO BMDMs treated with
  LPS. Statistical analysis was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining showing STING (green) and NLRP3 (red) colocalization in Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO
  BMDMs stimulated with LPS. (F) Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression
  of NLRP3 in LPS-stimulated Xbp1M-KO BMDMs transfected with LV-Tmem173 or Sh-Irf3.
  (G) The gene levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il1b, and Cxcl10 in BMDMs; n = 3/group; 1-way
  ANOVA. (H) Schematic diagram of the putative IRF3 binding site within the Nlrp3
  promoter. The BMDMs were subjected to ChIP assay with anti-IRF3 or IgG antibody.
  The representative results from 3 independent experiments are shown. (I) Relative
  Bnip3 mRNA expression in Xbp1FL/FL BMDMs treated with Sh-Irf3 or KIN1148 with or
  without LPS stimulation were determined using qPCR; n = 3 biological replicates/group;
  1-way ANOVA. (J) Western blot was performed to analyse the levels of p-IRF3 in liver
  macrophages isolated from Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO mice treated with CCl4, BDL, or
  MCD. Statistical analysis was carried out using 1-way ANOVA. (K) Western blot was
  performed to analyse the levels of p-IRF3 in human normal or fibrotic liver tissue;
  Student t test. The values are shown as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance
  was assessed by Student t test or ANOVA. ∗∗p <0.01; ∗p <0.05. BDL, bile duct ligation;
