caption: Knockdown of SHMT2 inhibits breast tumor growth in vivo. HCC1806 cells with
  SHMT2 knockdown (KD-SHMT2) and control cells (KD-NC), while BT549 cells (SHMT2)
  with SHMT2 over-expression and control cells (Vector) were injected into the left
  and right back subcutaneously in 100 ul PBS. The average tumor volume reached 100
  mm3 and tumor volume was measured. Xenograft tumors were measured with vernier calipers,
  tumor volumes were calculated and growth curves were plotted (A, E). After 7 measurements,
  the mice were sacrificed and photographed (B, F). The xenograft was removed and
  photographed (C) and weighed (D, G). Immunohistochemical staining (H) detected the
  protein expression levels of P-ERK, P-P38, KI67, CD31, and SHMT2 in tumor tissues,
  *P < 0.05, Student’s t-test. The data are presented as mean ± SD from two independent
  experiments. N = 5 or 6/group, magnification 200 ×.
