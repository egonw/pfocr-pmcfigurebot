caption: 'Inhibitory effects of Xihuang pills extract on the expression of components
  of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase-B/mechanistic target of rapamycin
  signalling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. A: The protein expression levels and
  ratios of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase-B/mechanistic target of rapamycin
  (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) and p-PI3K/p-Akt/p-mTOR in SMMC-7721 cells were detected using Western
  blotting; B: PI3K/Akt/mTOR mRNA expression levels in SMMC-7721 cells, as determined
  using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); C: PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  mRNA expression levels in SMMC-7721 cells after treatment with different concentrations
  of Xihuang pills (XHP), as measured using RT–qPCR; D: Levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  and p-PI3K/p-Akt/p-mTOR proteins in SMMC-7721 cells treated with different concentrations
  of the XHP extract were detected using Western blotting. Relative protein and mRNA
  expression levels are shown in representative histograms. The experiment was repeated
  three times, and the data are presented as the means ± SD. aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01
  compared with the control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 compared with the XHP 0.625
  group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 compared with the XHP 1.25 group.'
