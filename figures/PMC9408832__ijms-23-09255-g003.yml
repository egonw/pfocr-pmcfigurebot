caption: Sphingolipid pathway and the fates of ceramide. Drugs that have been involved
  in clinical trials on glioma patients (listed in ) are in blue boxes. Pre-clinical
  drugs are listed in red or green boxes, depending on their status as inhibitors
  or activators. Additional research translating preclinical drugs may result in novel
  clinical trials on glioma patients and other cancer types. SPT, serine palmitoyl-CoA
  transferase; KDSR, keto-dihydrosphingosine reductase; CerS, ceramide synthase; DEGS,
  dihydroceramide desaturase; SGMS, sphingomyelin synthase; SMPD, sphingomyelinase;
  CERK, ceramide kinase; C1PP, ceramide 1-phosphate phosphatase; UGCG, UDP-glucose
  ceramide glucosyltransferase; GBA, glucocerebrosidase; ASAH/ACER, ceramidase; SPHK,
  sphingosine kinase; SGPP, sphingosine phosphate phosphatase; SGPL, sphingosine phosphate
  lyase.
