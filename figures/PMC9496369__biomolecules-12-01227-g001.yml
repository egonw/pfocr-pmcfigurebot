caption: Role of oxidative stress and NRF2/KEAP1/ARE pathway in the multiplex diabetic
  nephropathy pathophysiology. DM associated with multifarious risk factors through
  persistent hyperglycemia, inflammation and OS, can instigate renal integrative glomerular
  barrier complex dysfunction (IGBC). IGBC is mainly formed by endothelial cells,
  the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), podocytes, tubular epithelial and mesangial
  cells. Each of these cells under influence of the disruptive mechanism mentioned
  above, produce factors and activate intricate pathways that have individual or entangled
  repercussion, which finally leads to impairment of the renal filtration unit. The
  major targets of OS are the fenestrated glomerular endothelial cells and the podocytes
  cells. Here, ER and mitochondrial stress enhances transcriptional activation of
  the NRF2/KEAP1/ARE pathway which can lead to a beneficial antioxidant response.
