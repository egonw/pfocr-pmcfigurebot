caption: The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-caused dopaminergic (DA) neurons degeneration,
  food-sensitive behavioral deficits, and shortened lifespan in nematodes were ameliorated
  by narcissoside (NCS) pretreatment. (A) Appropriate concentrations of narcissoside
  (NCS) to treat nematodes were determined by food clearance assays. In 96-well plates,
  L1 stage nematodes of N2, BZ555, NL5901, and DA2123 were grown on S medium containing
  OP50 of E. coli (OD A595 = 0.6), and a series of dilution NCS concentrations. The
  plates were placed in an incubator at 20 °C for 6 days, and each well was recorded
  the OD value daily. (B,C) Transfer L1 stage nematodes of BZ555 to culture plates
  with or without DMSO (1%) and grow to L3 stage, following by exposure to 50 mM 6-OHDA
  for 1 h. Next, nematodes were transferred to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR)-containing
  culture plates with or without DMSO (1%) and incubated for an additional 3 days
  for various analyses. (B) Representative GFP fluorescence images of DA neurons in
  the head of BZ555 nematodes in each group (left panel). Scale bar = 50 µm. The quantification
  of the fluorescence intensity of each group used ImageJ software (right panel).
  (C) BZ555 nematodes were scored for phenotypic deficits in DA neuron degeneration,
  with either disrupted axonal fluorescence signal or punctate as degeneration. Data
  are indicated as the percentage of nematodes with a DA neuron-deficient phenotype
  in each group. (D–F) Transfer L1 stage nematodes of BZ555 or N2 to culture plates
  with or without NCS and grow to L3 stage, following by exposure to 50 mM 6-OHDA
  for 1 h. Next, nematodes were transferred to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR)-containing
  culture plates with or without NCS and incubated for an additional 3 days for various
  analyses. (D) Representative GFP fluorescence images of DA neurons in the head of
  BZ555 nematodes in each group (left panel). Scale bar = 50 µm. The quantification
  of the fluorescence intensity of each group used ImageJ software (right panel) (E)
  BZ555 nematodes were scored for phenotypic deficits in DA neuron degeneration, with
  either disrupted axonal fluorescence signal or punctate as degeneration. Data are
  indicated as the percentage of nematodes with a DA neuron-deficient phenotype in
  each group. (F) The ability of NCS to restore dopamine neuron function in 6-OHDA-exposed
  N2 nematodes was assessed using food-sensitive assay. The nematode was placed on
  a bacteria-free lawn and bacteria lawn to count separately the number of S-shaped
  movements within 20 s. Slowing rate (%) = (the number of S-shaped movements of the
  nematode on bacteria-free lawn—the number of S-shaped movements of nematode on bacteria
  lawn)/the number of S-shaped movements of nematode on bacteria-free lawn) ×100%.
  A total of 50 nematodes were counted in each group. (G) The lifespan of the NCS-pretreated
  6-OHDA-exposed N2 nematodes was assessed by cumulative survival curves. The L3-stage
  nematodes were cultured in the plate with or without NCS, replaced with FUDR-containing
  fresh plates every three days. The number of surviving nematodes was counted daily
  until all nematodes died. The number of nematodes in each group was fifty.
