figure_title: GBA1 regulates the GlcCer levels in whole liver cancer cells and the
  plasma membrane of liver cancer cells
caption: A Total levels of GlcCer, Cer, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and sphingomyelin
  in HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (n = 4/WT group, n = 4/downregulated
  group) were measured by mass spectrometry. Data are shown as concentrations (μmol/mg
  protein), and significance was determined by Student’s t test. B, C Levels of subspecies
  of Cer and GlcCer in HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (n = 4/WT group,
  n = 4/downregulated group) were analysed by mass spectrometry. The data are shown
  as concentrations (μmol/mg protein), and significance was determined by Student’s
  t test. D Total levels of GlcCer, Cer, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and sphingomyelin
  in the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (n = 4/WT
  group, n = 4/downregulated group) were measured by mass spectrometry. The data are
  shown as concentrations (μmol/mg protein), and significance was determined by Student’s
  t test. E, F Levels of subspecies of Cer and GlcCer in the plasma membrane of HepG2
  cells with stable GBA1 downregulation (n = 4/WT group, n = 4/downregulated group)
  were analysed by mass spectrometry. The data are shown as concentrations (μmol/mg
  protein), and significance was determined by Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; ns, not
  significant.
