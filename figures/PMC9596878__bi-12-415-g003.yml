caption: Based on the above results, the expression of stemness-associated genes,
  including OCT4, c-MYC, KLF4, and SOX2, and the differentiation-associated cytokeratin
  genes including CK8, CK18, and CK19 in mammospheres following treatment with silibinin
  was assessed. In treated mammospheres, expression of all the stemness-associated
  genes were all significantly downregulated except for c-MYC in MCF-7-mammospheres,
  and NANOG and KLF4 in MDA-MB-468 mammospheres (). This reduction was accompanied
  with the overexpression of differentiation-associated genes in treated mammospheres
  derived from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 ( and ). CK18 was upregulated in treated
  MCF-7- mammospheres (). The STAT3 pathway is an active signaling pathway in tumors
  which activates and enhances cell proliferation, ,  and activity of this pathway
  has been suggested to be increased in BCSCs. ,  As shown in , silibinin significantly
  reduced the levels of Stat3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 in MCF-7-mammospheres,
  although this was not altered in mammospheres based on the other two cell lines.
  However, it was not possible to measure the expression levels of total Stat3, thus
  it cannot be stated with certainty, whether the total levels of Stat3 were reduced
  or phosphorylation of Stat3 was reduced.
