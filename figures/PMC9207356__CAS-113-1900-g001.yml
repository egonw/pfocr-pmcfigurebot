caption: Liver development, regeneration, and homeostasis. In the mammalian embryo,
  the endoderm gives rise to the foregut, which in turn gives rise to the fetal liver.
  In the adult, the liver plays a central role in metabolism and detoxification. The
  normal adult liver can successfully regenerate even after 70% of its mass is removed
  by partial hepatectomy. When there is a failure to regulate liver cell number or
  remove senescent, transformed, and/or damaged cells (gray arrows), abnormalities
  like hepatomegaly (increased liver size) can impair function and lead to liver diseases,
  including cirrhosis and cancer
