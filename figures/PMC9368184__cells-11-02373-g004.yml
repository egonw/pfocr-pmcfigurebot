caption: Metabolic heterogeneity and stem cell identification and cell–cell interaction
  correlates with therapeutic sensitivity. (A) RaceID3 and StemID2 analysis of 924
  adenocarcinoma cells from the original clusters. The link color indicates the link
  p-value, and the vertex color represents transcriptome entropy. The link p-value
  and transcriptome entropies were derived by StemID2. The thickness and color of
  a link indicate the transition probability between the connected clusters. (B) Heat
  map of enriched metabolic pathway for adenocarcinoma clusters. (C) Dot plot of best
  upstream ligands for eight cell types. (D) Signaling path for the RPS19 ligand and
  the target gene link. (E) Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) drug and
  target genes for gastric cancer. Green (negative correlation) indicates high drug
  sensitivity (F) Kaplan–Meier plot showing recurrence-free survival rates for high
  and low SERPINE1 expression in gastric cancer of TCGA cohort (up) and HS6ST2 (down).
