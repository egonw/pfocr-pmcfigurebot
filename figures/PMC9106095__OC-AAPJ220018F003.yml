caption: Schematic representation of the NF-κB signaling pathway during healthy and
  COVID-19 conditions in association with the production of proinflammatory factors.
  (A) The NF-κB signaling pathway during usual conditions, showing the sequential
  effects of phosphorylation and the usual production of proinflammatory cytokines.
  (B) The NF-κB signaling pathway during COVID-19 infection, showing the effects of
  blockage by inhibitors that block the phosphorylation of IKK-β and inhibit production
  of proinflammatory cytokines. NF-κB = nuclear factor κ B; COVID-19 = coronavirus
  disease 2019; IKK-β = IκB kinase-β. Reproduced with permission from Ref. .
