caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of action of Piezo1 in cardiomyocytes.
  Piezo1 helps cardiomyocytes transduce mechanical stretch into intracellular Ca2+signaling
  leading to ROS production. Mechanical overload results in increased Piezo1 expression
  in cardiomyocytes via the CaMKII-HDAC4â€“MEF2 pathway, ultimately leading to dilated
  cardiomyopathy (created with https://www.figdraw.com/static/index.html accessed
