caption: Sodium acetate (NaAc) promoted milk fat synthesis and activated the mTORC1
  signaling pathway in HC11 cells. HC11 cells were exposed to different concentrations
  (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.50 mM) of NaAc. (A) Oil red O staining images
  of HC11 cells. Scale bars are 100 μm. (B) TAG content of HC11 cells. (C) Relative
  mRNA expression abundance of genes related to milk fat synthesis. (D–G) Relative
  expression abundance of proteins related to milk fat synthesis and mTORC1 pathway.
  All data with error bars are averages ± SEM (n = 3). In histograms, no letter or
  the same letter above the bar graph indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05),
  and different letters indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05). Each small white
  dot represents a test value.
