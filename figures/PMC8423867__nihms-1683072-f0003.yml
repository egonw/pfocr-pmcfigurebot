figure_title: Overview of the N-terminal acetylation and lysine acetylation
caption: N-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of enzyme complexes, named N-terminal
  acetyltransferases (NATs) and it is deemed as irreversible. Lysine acetylation represents
  an enzymatic reaction by which the lysine residues of the target protein are acetylated
  by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs). It is usually reversible and the acetyl group
  can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs and SIRTs). The well-defined NATs,
  KATs and histone deacetylases, as well as their subcellular localization have been
  summarized and indicated in the Figure.
