caption: Nucleotide metabolism is an enriched signature accompanying adipocyte differentiation.A,
  schematic of the experimental setup, the cell model, and sample preparation for
  steady-state metabolomics. B, intracellular abundance of metabolites profiled from
  6 days of differentiated primary adipocytes relative to undifferentiated primary
  preadipocytes. C, table of the metabolic pathways significantly affected by 6-day
  differentiation. The pathway analysis module in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used for the
  analysis. D, schematic of the purine biosynthetic pathway illustrating metabolites
  that are depleted (red) or enriched (green) in 6-day differentiated primary adipocytes.
  E, relative levels of differentiation-enriched metabolites in the nucleotide biosynthesis
  pathway. Data shown are from four biological replicates. Statistical significance
  was determined using the Student’s t test. Error bars indicate mean ± SD, ∗p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001.
