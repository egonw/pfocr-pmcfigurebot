caption: PAB inhibits the PI3K/mTOR/AKT signaling pathway. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were
  exposed to the indicated doses of PAB for 48 h. The expression levels of PI3K, p-AKT
  (ser473), AKT, p-mTOR (ser3448) and mTOR were assessed by western blotting. (B)
  Quantitative data of the relative protein expression. (C) Cells were pretreated
  with PAB (5 µM), LY294002 (40 µM) or both for 48 h. Annexin V-FITC and PI staining
  were used to identify apoptosis rate, and (D) the data were analyzed by flow cytometry.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. control. PAB, Pseudolaric acid B;
  p-, phosphorylated.
