caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of thoracic ligamentum flavum cells
  (TLFCs) in different ossification stages via RNA‐sequencing. Representative images
  of haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for LGR5
  in ligament flavum samples of different ossification stages. Scale bar represents
  250 μm in low‐power field and 50 μm in high‐power field
article_title: LGR5 regulates osteogenic differentiation of human thoracic ligamentum
  flavum cells by Wnt signalling pathway.
