caption: 'IGF2BP2 is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell carcinoma cells and is the
  RNA-binding protein of NT5DC2. (A) mRNA and protein expression levels of IGF2BP2
  in human B lymphocyte (GM12878) and OCI-Ly7 cells were detected by RT-qPCR and western
  blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. GM12878. Combination of IGF2BP2 and NT5DC2 was confirmed
  by RNA (B) immunoprecipitation and (C) pull-down assay. ***P<0.001 vs. NT5DC2. (D)
  mRNA and protein expression levels of IGF2BP2 in OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with
  Oe-IGF2BP2 were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. Control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. Oe-NC. (E) mRNA and protein expression
  levels of NT5DC2 in OCI-Ly7 cells transfected with shRNA-NT5DC2 and Oe-IGF2BP2 were
  detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. Control; ###P<0.001 vs.
  shRNA-NC; ∆∆P<0.01 vs. shRNA-NT5DC2; &&P<0.01 vs. shRNA-NT5DC2 + Oe-NC. IGF2BP2,
  insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2; NT5DC2, 5′-nucleotidase domain-containing
  2; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; oe, overexpression; NC, negative
  control; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.'
article_title: Decreased RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 downregulates NT5DC2, which suppresses
  cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the p53 signaling pathway.
