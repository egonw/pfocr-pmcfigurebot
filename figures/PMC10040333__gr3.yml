caption: Six-week exercise or gAd treatment modulated the insulin signaling pathway
  in skeletal muscle.Representative Western blot (A–B) and densitometric quantification
  of adiponectin (C), adiponectin receptor1 (AdipoR1) (D), AKT, pAKT-Ser473 (E), AS160,
  pAS160-Thr642 (F) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) (G) in quadriceps of male WT
  and SESN2−/− mice following six-week exercise or gAd treatment. β-tubulin was used
  as the internal control (n ​= ​3 per group). Data were presented as means ​± ​standard
  error of the mean (SEM); ∗, p ​< ​0.05. HC - HFD control, HE - HFD exercise group,
  HC ​+ ​gAd - HFD gAd inject group, WT - wild type, SESN2 - Sestrin2.

  by enhancing the LKB1-mediated AMPK activation via SESN2.
