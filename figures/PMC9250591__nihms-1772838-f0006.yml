figure_title: Ectopic expression of HHIP in fungiform papilla after HH pathway inhibition
caption: '(A-A’’) H&E staining of fungiform papilla (FP)/taste bud (TB, oval outline)
  to illustrate three categories observed during HH pathway inhibition (HPI): (A)
  I. Typical FP/TB, (A’) II. Atypical FP/TB and (A’’) III. Atypical FP/No TB. (B-E)
  HHIP immunostaining (red) and TB cells (K8, green) after pharmacologic or genetic
  HPI. (B-B’’) HPI targeting Smo: SMO inhibition by Sonidegib drug, and (C-C’’) epi-Smo
  deletion with epithelial conditional deletion of Smo (cSmoKO). In Vehicle and Control,
  HHIP is consistently observed only in filiform papillae (FILIF) (B,C). After HPI
  with Sonidegib, in addition to FILIF expression, ectopic HHIP is observed next to
  the TB remnant (B’, arrows, Atypical FP/TB) and at FP apex in the former TB-bearing
  location (B’’, arrow, Atypical FP/No TB). Parallel ectopic HHIP expression in Atypical
  FPs (Type II and III) was seen in cSmoKO (C-C’’). (D-E) Gli2 suppression models:
  (D-D’’) epi-Gli2 deletion with epithelial conditional deletion of Gli2 (cGli2KO),
  and (E-E’’) epi-Gli2 repression by epithelial conditional activation of repressor
  form of Gli2 (cGli2ΔC4). Similar expression patterns are observed in these HPI models
  compared to Smo inhibition or deletion. In Controls, HHIP expression is only in
  FILIF and not in Typical FP/TB while after Gli2 suppression, in Atypical FP/TB and
  Atypical FP/No TB, there is ectopic expression of HHIP in FP apical regions. In
  B–E’’, white dotted lines outline the base of the epithelium. Yellow dotted lines
  label the surface of epithelium. DAPI stains cell nuclei.'
