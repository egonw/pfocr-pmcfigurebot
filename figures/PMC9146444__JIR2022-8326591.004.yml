caption: The TGF-β pathway is activated in M2-MDE-treated meningioma cells. (a) Volcano
  plot showing differentially expressed genes in IOMM-Lee cells cocultured with M2-MDEs
  relative to M0-MDEs. (b) GO enrichment analysis was used to reveal the functional
  characteristics of IOMM-Lee after coculture with MDEs according to the MSigDB database.
  (c) KEGG pathway analysis of IOMM-Lee after coculture with MDEs based on differentially
  expressed genes0. (d) qPCR was used to detect the mRNA expression level of TGF-β1
  in meningioma cells. (e) Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression
  levels of TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in meningioma cells. (f) Western
  blotting for the expressions of Smad2 and Smad3 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of
  meningioma, respectively. β-Tubulin and lamin B1 serve as house-keeping genes for
  cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  vs. the control and M0-MDE group.
