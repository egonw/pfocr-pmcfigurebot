caption: Reference measurements of the two-enzyme cascade reaction shown in  run in
  the bulk solution inside quartz glass cuvettes at RT with the two enzymes, namely,
  BCA and HRP, and the substrates DCFH2-DA and H2O2, all of which were present from
  the beginning at [BCA] = 1.5 μM and [DCFH2-DA]0 = 50 μM, pH = 7.2 (PBS). The conditions
  were chosen such that the reaction proceeded predominantly over pathway 2 (see ).
  (A) UV–vis spectra of the reaction mixture recorded during the reaction (every 5
  min for 15 h) using [HRP] = 100 nM and [H2O2]0 = 10 μM. In the inset, A460 (red)
  indicates the formation of DCF-MA or DCF (absorbance at the isosbestic point of
  the two molecules) and A503 (orange) is the absorbance at λmax of DCF. The change
  in A370 reflects changes in [DCF-MA]. After 90 min, A460 (DCF-MA and DCF) remained
  stable, while A370 (DCF-MA) decayed exponentially and A503 (DCF) continued to increase
  due to Hyd_3 (see ). Since A460 remained stable above t = 90 min, oxidation no longer
  took place, i.e., all the H2O2 was used up. (B) Changes in the molar concentrations
  of DCFH2-DA, DCFH2-MA and DCFH2, and DCF-MA and DCF for the reaction shown in panel
  A. Changes were determined using ε460(DCF-MA/DCF) = 19 800 M–1cm–1 (see Ghéczy et
  al.) and kcat/KM = 0.0130 μM–1 min–1 for the BCA-catalyzed hydrolysis of DCFH2-DA
  (see the Supporting Information, Figure S24) and by considering the mass balance
  to determine [DCFH2-MA] + [DCFH2] = 50 μM – ([DCFH2-DA] + [DCF-MA] + [DCF]). The
  calculated concentrations were crosschecked by spectral fitting the spectrum at
  t = 90 min (using the molar absorptions for all reaction components as obtained
  in our previous work). (C) Dependence of the initial rate of formation of DCF-MA
  and DCF on the concentration of HRP for [H2O2]0 = 30 μM, as analyzed by recording
  the increase in A460 with time (see the Supporting Information, Figure S26, for
  details). (D) Dependence of the formation of DCF-MA and DCF on the initial concentration
  of H2O2 (between 1 and 10 μM) for [HRP] = 100 nM, as analyzed by recording A460
  after t = 2 h. The ordinate on the right side refers to the total concentration
  of [DCF-MA] and [DCF], which was calculated by taking into account ε460(DCF-MA/DCF)
  = 19 800 M–1cm–1 (see Ghéczy et al.). As expected for the peroxidase cycle of HRP,
  for each two electron reduction of H2O2 by HRP, two one-electron oxidation products
  are produced. The solid line (red) reflects the linear regression of [DCF-MA] +
  [DCF] = 0.61 μM + 2.01 × [H2O2]0 (R2 = 0.9994, see the Supporting Information, Figure
  S30, for details).
