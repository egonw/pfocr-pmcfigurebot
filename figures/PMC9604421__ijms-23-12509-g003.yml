caption: The role of the Notch signaling pathway in reducing oxidative stress at CMC.
  The launch of the Notch signaling pathway enhances the synthesis of the Mfn2 protein
  responsible for mitophagy. The Notch1 receptor can bind to the tumor necrosis factor-α
  and block its action. The production of antioxidant enzymes is controlled through
  the Akt cascade. Energy conservation in the cell is achieved by activating the AMPK
  cascade. “Created with BioRender.com”.
