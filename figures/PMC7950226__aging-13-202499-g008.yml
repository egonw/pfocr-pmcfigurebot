caption: GSEA identifies a FANCE-related signaling pathway. Cell cycle, DNA repair,
  and apoptosis signaling pathways are differentially enriched in the high FANCE expression
  phenotype. Immunoglobulin binding, monocyte chemotaxis and regulation of macrophage
  cytokine production are enriched in the FANCE down-regulation phenotype.
