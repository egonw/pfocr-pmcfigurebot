caption: PRDX6 overexpression attenuates H2O2-induced oxidative damage in ARPE-19
  cells. ARPE-19 cells were infected with lentivirus containing a control plasmid
  or the pLV-Flag PRDX6 plasmid for 48 h and were then treated with H2O2. (A) Cell
  viability was measured using an MTT assay. (B) Cell death analysis by flow cytometry.
  (C) Quantification of ARPE-19 cell death, n = 3. (D) Flow cytometric analysis of
  ROS levels, with DCFDA staining. (E) Histograms representing the relative ROS levels,
  which were fluorescence densities of DCF transformed from DCFDA, n = 3, *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01.
