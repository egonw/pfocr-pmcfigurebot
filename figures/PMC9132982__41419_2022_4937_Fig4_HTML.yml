figure_title: Study on the mechanism of proguanil-enhanced EGFR endocytosis
caption: A, B T24 were plated in 6-well plates (2.0 × 105/well) and transfected with
  corresponding siRNA as described in “Materials and methods”. When the cell density
  reaches 70–80%, cells were starved for 12 h and then treated with proguanil for
  6 h. The effect of proguanil on the expression of EGFR was detected by WB. C After
  si Clathrin or si Caveolin-1 as described in “Materials and methods”, T24 were plated
  on glass disks in 12-well plates (2.0 × 104/well), starved for 12 h and then treated
  with proguanil, and the changes of EGFR were detected by immunofluorescence. D When
  the density of T24 reaches 70–80% in 75 cm2 vented culture flasks, cells starved
  for 12 h and then treated with proguanil. Then protein lysates were immunoprecipitated
  with EGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitate were tested by WB with antibodies to EGFR,
  Clathrin and Caveolin-1. E Cells were transfected with corresponding siRNA as described
  in “Materials and methods” and then plated in 96-well plates (6.0 × 103/well), the
  bioactivity of proguanil after si Clathrin or si Caveolin-1 was detected by MTT
  assay. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars represent
  means ± SD from triplicate experiments. Vehicle control means the concentration
  of DMSO lower than 0.3% (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant).
