caption: Pharmacological blockage and SLC6A14 silence inhibit GC metastasis. Indicated
  GC cells were treated with α-MT (5 mM), LV-pTZU-SLC6A14 (MOI = 60), or LV-pcDNA3.1-SLC6A14
  (MOI = 60) plasmid for 48 h and then prepared for the (a) wound healing, (b) cell
  migration, and (c) invasion assays. For (a)–(c), data were demonstrated as the representative
  photographs (left panels in (a) and upper panels in (b, c)) and were also expressed
  as the migration rate (right panel in (a)) and the number of migrated and invasive
  cells (bottom panels in (b, c)) with the means ± SD of three replicates. ∗∗P < 0.01.
  (d) Luminescent cells in metastasized foci of each group were quantified using IVIS-SPECTRUM
  in vivo photon counting device. Data were shown as the photon flux with the means
  ± SD from three triplicate experiments. ∗∗P < 0.01. (e) The number of mice with
  GC metastasis in each group was summarized.
