caption: The overlapping genes between the DEGs and PHT target genes and these overlapping
  genes' enriched biological processes and KEGG pathways. (a) Venn diagram showing
  the overlapping genes between DEGs and PHT target genes. (b) The significantly enriched
  biological processes of the PHT target genes. (c) The significantly enriched signaling
  pathways of the PHT target genes. (d) The significantly enriched biological processes
  enriched by the upregulated PHT target DEGs. (e) The significantly enriched KEGG
  pathways enriched by the upregulated PHT target DEGs. (f) The significantly enriched
  biological processes enriched by the down-regulated PHT target DEGs. (g) The significantly
  enriched KEGG pathways enriched by the downregulated PHT target DEGs.
