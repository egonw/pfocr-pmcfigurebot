caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after interference
  of DGAT2. (A) KEGG enrichment factor map. (B) KEGG functional annotation of DEGs
  involved in the PPAR signaling pathway. Green rectangles indicate that DEGs were
  significantly downregulated (log fold change > 1, FDR < 0.001) in BSCs infected
  with sh-DGAT2 compared to control sh-NC.
