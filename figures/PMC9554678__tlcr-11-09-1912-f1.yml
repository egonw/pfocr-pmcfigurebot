caption: PTS was highly expressed in LUAD. (A) PTS expression level in LUAD in TCGA
  data. (B) PTS expression level in LUAD based on individual cancer stages. (C) Correlation
  analysis of PTS level and prognosis of LUAD patients. Expression of PTS level in
  LUAD tissues was measured by Western blot (D) and immunohistochemistry (stained
  with PTS antibody; magnification 40Ã—) (E). PTS mRNA and protein level in LUAD cells
  was tested by qRT-PCR (F) and Western blot (G). **, P<0.01, compared with the indicated
  group. TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; mRNA, messenger
  RNA; PTS, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase; HR, hazard ratio; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
article_title: PTS is activated by ATF4 and promotes lung adenocarcinoma development
  via the Wnt pathway.
