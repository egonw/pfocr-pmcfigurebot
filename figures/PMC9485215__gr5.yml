caption: miRNA target gene identification(A–C) (A) Flow chart describing miRNA target
  gene selection. (B) Functional enrichment analysis. Bar plot depicts the top 10
  enriched biological pathways using KEGG, as identified after performing ShinyGO
  enrichment analysis with miR-125b, miR-181a, miR-593, and miR-1227 predicted target
  genes. The y axis represents the pathway term, and the x axis represents the enrichment
  significance (−log10 p value), respectively. (C) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of miRNA
  predicted target gene mRNA levels in HCT116 cells after 24 h of butyrate treatment.
  miR-125b, TRIM29 and ZEB1; miR-181a, COX2, FZD4, LRP6, and PIK3R3; miR-593, CCND1,
  EEF2K, ERBB2, MET, and PAK2; miR-1227, DVL3, NUP62 and PIK3R3 in HCT116 cells treated
  with 0 mM or 2.5 mM butyrate for 24 h, over a 72-h post-transfection period. The
  mean mRNA levels ± SEM of five replicates is represented and their expression is
  normalized to the geometric mean of three reference genes, ACTB, B2M, and GAPDH.
  Significant values are indicated by ∗p <.05, ∗∗p <.01, ∗∗∗p <.001, ∗∗∗∗p <.0001.
