caption: Differences in the expression of 17βHSDs and androgen sensitivity among three
  PC cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2 and 22Rv1). (A) Expression of AR, AKR1C3 and DHRS11 were
  detected by immunoblotting. (B–D) Effects of 11-ketoandrogens on androgen signaling
  in LNCaP (B), C4-2 (C) and 22Rv1 (D) cells. The cells were treated for 24 h with
  the indicated concentrations of 11KDHT, 11KAdione or DHT. The mRNA expression levels
  of PSA and TMPRSS2 in the cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR analysis. ** p < 0.01,
  * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 compared with the control cells treated with DMSO alone.
