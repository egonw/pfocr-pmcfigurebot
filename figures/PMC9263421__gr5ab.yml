caption: 'Systems biology analysis in MCD. IPA of the 70 significant differentially
  expressed MCD-associated proteins was conducted to identify key upstream regulators
  (a,b) and biological function associations (c,d) enriched in patients with MN. (a)
  List of the most significant upstream regulators that best explain the observed
  expression changes in MCD versus N and MN. (b) A total of 4 significant upstream
  regulators (HIF1A, TGFB1, LPL, MYC) and the MCD-associated proteins predicted to
  be downstream of these upstream regulators. IPA color and symbol guide: blue, inhibition;
  orange, activation; red, increased; green, decreased; yellow, contrary to published
  evidence; gray, unknown; dashed line, indirect; arrowhead (pointed), activating;
  arrowhead (blunt), inhibitory. (c) List of the most significant biological functions
  that best explain the observed expression changes in MCD versus N and MN. (d). A
  total of 3 significant classes of biological functions enriched among the MCD-associated
  70-protein signature. IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; MCD, minimal change disease;
  MN, membranous nephropathy; N, healthy controls.'
