caption: 'In healthy postganglionic sympathetic neurons (symNs) (a), norepinephrine
  (NE) secretion in the axon terminal is properly regulated by norepinephrine transporter
  (NET), which reuptakes about 80% of released NE, α adrenergic receptors (αAR), which
  downregulate NE secretion and β adrenergic receptors (βAR), which upregulate NE
  secretion. NET is trafficked to the cell membrane with the help of RAB proteins.
  In FD symNs (b), NET expression is decreased, leading to oversecreted NE. NET trafficking
  might be affected by the downregulation of RAB3A. In addition, our results indicate
  that βAR in FD symNs might have stronger response than healthy symNs, which might
  further strengthen the release of NE and symN activity. Several therapeutic targets
  are identified in this study using a selection of clinical compounds: flupirtine
  activates potassium channels (K channel) and induces neural depolarization; carbidopa
  blocks NE synthetic pathway and thus reduces NE overspill; dexmedetomidine (Dexmed)
  activates αAR while propranolol inhibits βAR. All these drugs suppress FD symN hyperactivity
  in vitro.'
