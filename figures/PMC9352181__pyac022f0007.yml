caption: 'Effects of DHF-7 on the activation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in the corpus
  callosum of mouse model (western blotting). (A) Representative blot images of phosphorylated
  and total Raf (B-Raf), phosphorylated and total MEK1/2, phosphorylated and total
  Erk1/2. (B) The quantitative analysis of phosphorylated and total B-Raf expression
  level. (C) The quantitative analysis of phosphorylated and total MEK1/2. (D) The
  quantitative analysis of phosphorylated and total Erk1/2. The ratio of phosphorylated
  to total level in the control group was taken as 100%. Data are expressed as the
  mean Â± SEM, n = 3. ##P < .01, model group vs. control group; *P < .05, **P < .01,
  drug-treated groups vs. model group.'
