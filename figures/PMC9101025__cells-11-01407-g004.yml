caption: NAE_2022C inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB and ERK1/2 activation by targeting
  the IKK complex. (A) HaCaT cells were stimulated with 0.75 ng mL−1 TNFα for different
  times, as indicated in the presence or absence of 10 µg mL−1 NAE_2022C. Cells were
  analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. The intensity of the
  bands was analyzed using Image J, as in B. (B) Schematic representation of the TNFR/NF-κB
  pathway. Inhibition of the IKK complex by NAE_2022C is indicated. Blue and red arrows
  represent a decrease and increase in protein phosphorylation, respectively. Dashed
  arrows indicate the NAE_2022C-mediated inhibition of signaling events downstream
  of IKKs.
