caption: Targeted analysis of metabolites from central metabolism in wild-type and
  tga256 mutant plants. Plants were screened for metabolic changes in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
  pathway or the Calvin-Benson cycle 24 h after spraying with salicylic acid (SA).
  Yellow dots show average values, and individual plant values are shown as black
  dots (n = 9). The center line represents the median; upper and lower box limits
  indicate quartiles 1 and 3, respectively, and whiskers show the minima and maxima
  of the dataset. DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate; MEcDP, 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  IDP/DMADP, isopentenyl, and dimethylallyl diphosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate;
  GAP/DHAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (detected as
  a single peak); PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; sedoheptulose
  7-phosphate; Xu5P, xylulose 5-phosphate; IDP and DMADP could not be resolved by
  this method. Groups with different letters have significantly different means (p
  â‰¤ 0.05) as calculated by a Tukey-Kramer test following a two-way ANOVA. Analyte
  peak areas were normalized to that of the internal standard. Quantification was
  based on an external standard curve corrected for recovery of the internal standard,
  1-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate.
