caption: Standard curve of the balanol. Balanol was prepared in a solution from 25
  mg/L to 180 mg/L for HPLC analysis. The peak area of balanol was used to establish
  the standard curve of its concentration. In the regression equation, Y = 31.764x
  âˆ’ 203.51 (R2 = 0.9993), Y indicates the concentration of balanol, and X indicates
  the peak area of balanol.
