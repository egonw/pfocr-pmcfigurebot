figure_title: GR cells increases pyrimidine biosynthesis to generate dCTP
caption: 'Schematic of altered mechanisms in GR cells in glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Glucose is transferred from aerobic glycolysis to PPP.
  Glucose flux into the PPP results in increased nucleotide biosynthesis, including
  purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.PPP metabolite levels in T24GR and UMUC3GR cells
  relative to WT cells based on targeted CE‐MS metabolomics The data are shown as
  the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student''s
  t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Levels of endpoint metabolites of the
  purine synthesis pathway in GR cells relative to those in WT cells as determined

  t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Relative mRNA expression levels of G6PD, TIGAR, TKT,
  and CTPS1, which are the genes responsible for activating the PPP and pyrimidine
  biosynthesis. WT and GR cells are shown. The data are shown as the mean values ± SEs
  (n = 3, biological replicates). The expression levels were analyzed by Student''s
  t‐test and plotted relative to expression levels in WT cells (left: T24 cells, right:
  UMUC3 cells). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n.s., non‐significant.Western

  of the glycolytic pathway and the PPP. Glucose flux into the PPP results in increased
  nucleotide biosynthesis, including purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Leflunomide
  inhibits pyrimidine biosynthesis.The viability of WT and GR cells was assessed by
  WST assays under treatment with gemcitabine (Gem), leflunomide, or Gem with leflunomide.
  The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates). Comparisons
  were made with respect to the corresponding controls or the indicated groups, followed
  by analysis with Student''s t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.CE‐MS‐based

  t‐test. ***P < 0.001. N.D., non‐detectable.Comparison of baseline dCTP levels in
  WT and GR cell lines determined by CE‐MS metabolomic analysis. The data are shown
