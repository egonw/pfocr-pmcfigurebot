caption: Cell–cell communication analysis of malignant epithelial cells. (A) Capacity
  for intercellular communication among the three malignant epithelial cell subtypes.
  The size of the circle is proportional to the number of cells. The cells that emit
  arrows express ligands and the cells that arrows point to express receptors. The
  more ligand–receptor pairs, the thicker the line. (B) Bubble plot showing the intercellular
  interaction relationship mediated by ligand–receptor pairs. (C) Violin plots showing
  the expression of representative genes in the MK and MIF signaling pathway.
