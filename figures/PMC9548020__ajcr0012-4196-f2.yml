caption: Graphs comparing the HNCSC and non-HNCSC subpopulations for all seven samples.
  (A) The number on the vertical axis means the average percentage of the migrated
  area; (B) images representatives of the cell migration in 0 h and after 24 h times
  in 40× magnification; (C) comparison of the percentage of the cells migrated related
  to CD44/CD117/CD133 and ALDH cell sorting criteria; (D) comparison of the percentage
  of the cells migrated between oral cavity, pharynx and larynx primary subsites;
  (E) the number on the vertical axis means the mean of the number of the cells that
  went through the camera with matrigel (invasion assay); (F) images representatives
  of the cell invasion after 24 h in 200× magnification; and (G) comparison of the
  percentage of the cells invaded related to CD44/CD117/CD133 and ALDH cell sorting
  criteria; (H) comparison of the percentage of the cells invaded between oral cavity,
  pharynx and larynx primary subsites. *P<0.01 vs. to non-HNCSCs group by two-way
  ANOVA statistical analysis data.
