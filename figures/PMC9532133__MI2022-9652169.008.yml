caption: 'Pathway analysis of aberrant regulation of TAP1 gene: (a) heat map of aberrantly
  regulated pathway enrichment scores; (b) difference in aberrantly regulated pathway
  enrichment scores between the high- and low-expression groups of the TAP1 gene;
  (c) point bar graph of correlation between aberrantly regulated pathway enrichment
  scores and TAP1 gene expression, where color is significance and size of point is
  strength of correlation; (d) correlation between TAP1 expression and hypoxia, energy
  metabolism, and inflammation-related pathways in a correlation heat map.'
