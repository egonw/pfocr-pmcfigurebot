caption: Summary diagram of our results. PSMA‐specific CAR‐modified NK92 cells were
  activated through the specific recognition of PSMA on PCa cells, and CAR NK‐92 cell
  expression of PD‐L1 was upregulated via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, while
  C4‐2 cell expression of PD‐L1 was upregulated via the IFN‐γ‐mediated JAK1/2‐STAT1
  pathway. On the one hand, atezolizumab potentiated CAR NK‐92 cell cytotoxicity by
  directly acting on PD‐L1 expressed on CAR NK‐92 cells; on the other hand, atezolizumab
  unleashed CD8+ T cells by blocking the canonical PD‐L1/PD‐1 axis; MICA/B, MHC class
  I chain‐related protein A and B; NKG2D, NK group 2 member D; PSMA, prostate‐specific
  membrane antigen
article_title: Combined treatment with anti‐PSMA CAR NK‐92 cell and anti‐PD‐L1 monoclonal
  antibody enhances the antitumour efficacy against castration‐resistant prostate
  cancer.
