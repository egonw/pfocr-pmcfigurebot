caption: A heatmap showing the percentage homology of F. keratoplasticum ergosterol
  biosynthesis pathway protein sequences to S. cerevisiae (Scer), A. fumigatus (Afum),
  F. graminearum (Fgra), F. vanettenii (Fvat) and Fusarium solani sensu stricto (FSSC5).
  For genes with no obvious orthologs in other fungal species the gene most homologous
  to the F. keratoplasticum gene is indicated inside the rectangle. NA indicates a
  homolog was not found. Genes (ebp1, dhcr7 and dhcr24) with characteristics similar
  to human cholesterol biosynthesis [] genes are highlighted in green font. Asterisk
  (*) indicates only a partial gene transcript was assembled/sequenced.

  Resistance Regulatory Network, including an Alternative Ergosterol Biosynthesis
  Pathway, in the Clinically Important FSSC Species, Fusarium keratoplasticum.
