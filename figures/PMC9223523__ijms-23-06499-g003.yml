caption: Biochemical model of Toll pathway activation in D. melanogaster cells as
  a response to microbial infection. The observed gene expression change corresponding
  to the experimental conditions and mutants is shown in blue (upregulation) or red
  (downregulation). With orange-filled or orange-bordered squares, we indicate that
  the corresponding gene significantly varies its expression in infected and, respectively,
  uninfected γCOP14a/γCOP14a males. With green-filled or green-bordered triangles
  we indicate that the marked gene significantly varies its expression in infected
  and, respectively, uninfected γCOPS057302/TM6B males. Unmarked components of the
  pathway did not show any statistically significant expression change. Created with
