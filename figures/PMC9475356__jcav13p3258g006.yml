caption: Effects of PRDX5 over-expression on β-CCE-induced intracellular ROS and apoptosis-related
  protein expression levels and MAPK signalling pathway. (A) Changes in the levels
  of intracellular ROS in MOCK and PRDX5-over-expressing HepG2 cells treated with
  β-CCE (80 µg/mL) for 24 h were detected by DHE staining. DHE (red), Hoechst (blue),
  and light images were measured by fluorescence microscopy (scale bar = 400 µM).
  (B) Changes in the MMP of MOCK and PRDX5-over-expressing HepG2 cells treated with
  β-CCE (80 µg/mL) for 24 h were detected by DHE staining. JC-1 polymer (red), JC-1
  monomer (green), and light images were measured by fluorescence microscopy (scale
  bar = 400 µM). (C) The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in MOCK and
  PRDX5-over-expressing HepG2 cells treated with β-CCE (80 µg/mL) for 24 h were detected
  by western blotting. (D-G) Quantitative analysis of (D) Bcl-xL, (E) Bax, (F) c-Cas
  9, and (G) c-Cas 3 expression levels. (H) The expression of ERK, JNK, and P38 and
  their phosphorylated proteins (p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38) in MOCK and PRDX5-over-expressing
  HepG2 cells treated with β-CCE (80 µg/mL) for 24 h were detected by western blotting.
  (I-K) Quantitative analysis of (I) p-ERK, (J) p-JNK, and (K) p-P38 expression levels
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
