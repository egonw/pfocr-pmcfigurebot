caption: 'rhCHI3L1 promotes angiogenesis through the PI3K-AKT/ERK-eNOS signaling pathway
  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). (A) Representative pictures of
  western blotting for detection of total and phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, ERK as well
  as eNOS protein expression in HUVEC. (B) Bar graph shows densitometric analysis
  of western blotting bands (n = 3/group). Abbreviations: rhCHI3L1, recombined human
  chitinase-3-like protein 1; LY294002, 2-morpholino-8-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one. Symbol
  * indicates p < 0.05 between the relevant groups.'
