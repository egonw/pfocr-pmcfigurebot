caption: TI-IFN and related signaling pathways are potential pharmacological targets
  in kidney injury. Viral disease, pharmacological therapies with IFNα/β and endogenous
  (TWEAK, IFNα/β) or exogenous (LPS) proinflammatory inducers of kidney injury (A)
  may stress tubular cells that in turn activate adaptive innate immune mechanisms,
  including the intertwined TBK1/IKKε/IRF3 (B) and TI-IFN (C) pathways. Signaling
  through these pathways triggers NF-κB-dependent cytokine synthesis (D), apoptosis
  (E), and activates the ISG antiviral program (F). Overall, these responses may amplify
  inflammation (cytokine storm), induce tubular cell loss (apoptosis), and contribute
  to kidney injury in vivo (G). In this regard, immune-mediated inhibition of IFNAR
  with neutralizing antibodies (H) or the TBK1/IKKε signaling node with amlexanox
  (AMX) (I) was beneficial in decreasing renal inflammation and cell death (G), thus
  allowing to identify TBK1/IKKε and IFNAR as novel therapeutic targets for nephroprotection.
