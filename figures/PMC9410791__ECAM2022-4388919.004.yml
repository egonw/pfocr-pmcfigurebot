caption: Effects of the FAT10 overexpression and PI3K/AKT inhibition on oxidative
  stress in hypoxia-stimulated H9C2 cells. Levels of (a) SOD, (b) MDA, (c) GSH, (d)
  GSH-PX, and (e) LDH in H9C2 cells. (f) Detection of H9C2 cells with enhanced ROS
  production by employing flow cytometry. Data are denoted to be mean ± SD, n = 3,
  ∗p < 0.05.
