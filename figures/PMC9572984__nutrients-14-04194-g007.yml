caption: 'The effects of protein expression at 1 h after LPS administration in Kupffer
  cells: (A) Bands of proteins. The values of CD14 (B) and TLR4 (C) were normalized
  by the value of the total protein. (D) The effects of CPs on IkB-α degradation at
  1 h after LPS administration in Kupffer cells. The expression levels of phosphorylated
  and total JNK, ERK, and p-38 protein were detected by western blotting. The value
  of JNK (E), ERK (F), and p-38 (G) were normalized by the value of the total protein.
  The effects of CPs on the TNF-α (H) and IL-1 (I) expression level in supernatants
  of KCs at 12 h after LPS treatment. Different letters represented the significant
  difference at p < 0.05.'
