figure_title: Supplementation with cystine enhanced the efficacy of DTX in vitro
caption: 'a The PLS-DA model for A549/DTX cells given cystine supplementation for
  48 h and A549 cells (PC1: R2X (cum) = 0.447, R2Y (cum) = 0.245, Q2 (cum) = 0.237;
  PC2: R2X (cum) = 0.575, R2Y (cum) = 0.457, Q2 (cum) = 0.375; PC3: R2X (cum) = 0.700,
  R2Y (cum) = 0.651, Q2 (cum) = 0.571) (n = 6). b Effect of cystine or NAC supplementation
  for 48 h on ROS levels in A549/DTX cells (n = 3). c Effect of cystine supplementation
  for 48 h on GSH levels in A549/DTX cells (n = 6). d Effect of cystine supplementation
  for 48 h on the protein levels of key enzymes in the GSH synthesis pathway in A549/DTX
  cells. The experiments were performed three times with similar results. e Effect
  of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the viability of A549/DTX cells (n = 3).
  f Sufficient cystine supplementation for 48 h affected the ability of DTX to induce
  apoptosis in A549/DTX cells (n = 3). g Effect of cystine supplementation on the
  intracellular accumulation of DTX in A549/DTX cells (n = 4). h Effect of cystine
  supplementation on the subcellular organelle distribution of DTX in A549/DTX cells
  (n = 3). i Effect of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the mRNA level of P-gp
  in A549/DTX cells (n = 3). j Effect of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the protein
  level of P-gp in A549/DTX cells. The experiments were performed three times with
  similar results. k Effect of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the fluorescence
  intensity of Rho123 in A549/DTX cells. Scale bars, 200 μm; (n = 3). l Effect of
  cystine supplementation for 48 h on the fluorescence intensity of Rho123 in A549/DTX
  cells, as quantitatively measured with flow cytometry analysis. (n = 3). m Effect
  of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the protein levels of key enzymes in the
  GSH synthesis pathway in A549 cells. The experiments were performed three times
  with similar results. n Effect of cystine supplementation for 48 h on the protein
  level of P-gp in A549 cells (n = 5). o Effect of cystine supplementation for 48 h
  on the viability of A549 cells (n = 3). Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
  comparison test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***,###P < 0.001. Data represent the mean ± SEM.'
