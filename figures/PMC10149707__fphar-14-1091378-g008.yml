caption: The prognostic risk models in predicting patients’ benefit from immunization/chemotherapy.
  (A) Differences in “T cell inflamed GEP score” between subgroups; (B) Differences
  in “response to IFN-γ” between subgroups; (C) Differences in “C-γ” between subgroups.
  (C) Difference of “Cytolytic activity” between different subgroups; (D) Difference
  of immune checkpoint gene expression between different subgroups; (E) Spearman analysis
  was conducted for correlation analysis on drug sensitivity and RiskScore, with each
  column representing a type of drug. Correlation significance is reflected in color
  brightness. The correlation of RiskScore with drug sensitivity (Rs < 0) or drug
  resistance (Rs > 0) was reflected in the height of a column. (F) The horizontal
  axis is the drug name and the vertical axis is the signaling pathway targeted by
  the drug. The signaling pathway targeted by the drug is sensitive to RiskScore (blue);
  (G) Box plots of IC50 estimates for dasatinib, gemcitabine, cisplatin, erlotinib
  and 5-fluorouracil in TCGA-PAAD; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; and ****p
  < 0.0001.
