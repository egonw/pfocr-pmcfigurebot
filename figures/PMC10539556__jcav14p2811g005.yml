caption: Knockdown of PTEN significantly reversed the influence of miR-424 inhibitor
  on tumor growth in vivo. (A) Metastatic tumor experiment was performed (n=4); (B)
  The tumor weight was recorded; (C) The tumor volume was analyzed (* means p<0.05
  compared with group miR-424 inhibitor); (D) The ki67 expression in the tumor tissue
  was evaluated (n=4). * means p <0.05.

  carcinoma via targeting PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
