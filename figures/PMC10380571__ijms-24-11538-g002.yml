caption: 'Triggers and general signalling pathways of cellular senescence. Telomere
  attrition, telomeric DNA damage, shelterin protein downregulation, and damages accumulated
  on non-telomeric DNA from other stimuli collectively trigger the DNA damage response
  (DDR) and p16/pRb pathway, resulting in either temporary cell cycle arrest for the
  DNA repair process or permanent cell cycle arrest, known as cellular senescence.
  DDR involves a series of processes. While the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, accompanied
  by activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/Cell Cycle Checkpoint kinase-2
  (CHK2), is implicated in DNA double-strand breaks, the 9-1-1 (RAD9-RAD1-HUS1) complex,
  leading to activation of ATM and rad3-related (ATR)/CHK1, is implicated in DNA single-strand
  breaks. Once activated, checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 trigger cell cycle arrest
  by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activation through the p53/p21 and
  CDC25 pathways. The accumulation of telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage induces
  the expression of p16INK4A. The P16 protein inhibits CDK 4/6, thereby suppressing
  Rb phosphorylation and the release of E2F translation factor, which is crucial for
  cell cycle progression. RNF: ring finger containing nuclear factor; 53BP1: P53-binding
  protein 1; BRCA1: breast cancer type 1; RPA: replication protein A; ATRIP: ATR-interacting
  protein; TopBP1: DNA Topoisomerase II Binding protein 1; CDC: cell division cycle;
  TIN: telomeric repeat binding factor 1/2-interacting nuclear factor 2; TRF: telomeric
  repeat binding factor; RAP1: repressor/activator protein 1; POT1: protection of
  telomeres 1; TPP1: POT1-interacting protein 1.'
