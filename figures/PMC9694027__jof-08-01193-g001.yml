caption: (A) KEGG metabolic pathway analysis for DOM from rape straw between group
  Se0 and Se1.12. The darker the color, the smaller the P value and the more significant
  the enrichment degree. (B) A schematic diagram showing that Se regulated the metabolic
  pathway that is relevant to disease resistance and reduced the incidence rate of
  S. sclerotiorum. Se regulated multiple metabolism pathways and specific metabolites,
  which were relevant to the effects of systemic resistance.
