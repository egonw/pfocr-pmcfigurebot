caption: 'Effects of kaempferol on the survival of BV2 cells. (a) The chemical structure
  of kaempferol. (b) Cells were treated with 5–350 μM of kaempferol for 24 hr, and
  cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay. Kaempferol switched the increase of
  M1 polarization in LPS‐induced BV2 cells and it stimulated the formation of the
  M2 phenotype. Same as TLR4/NF‐ĸB inhibitor. (c) The relative levels of IL1β, TNF‐ɑ,
  iNOS, and CD32 (M1 markers) mRNA were measured by RT‐PCR. (d) The relative levels
  of IL10, Arg‐1, and CD206 (M2 markers) mRNA were measured by RT‐PCR. Effects of
  kaempferol on M1/M2 polarization in LPS‐induced BV2 cells. The proportion of M1
  microglia (e,f) and the percentage of M2 microglia (g,h) were measured by flow cytometry.
  *p < .05 versus control group, #p < .05 versus LPS group, and ##p > .05 versus LPS
  group. One‐way ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups'
