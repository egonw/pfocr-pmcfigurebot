caption: 'Effect of ZGZT on autophagy-associated proteins. (A) Autophagy-related factors
  and the protein expression levels of AMPK and mTOR (the internal reference gene
  of ULK 1 and Beclin 1 was GAPDH-1. The reference gene of LC3 II and Atg5 was GAPDH-2.
  The internal reference gene of AMPK and mTOR was GAPDH-3) (1: Control group; 2:
  PMOP group; 3: PMOP + ZGZT group; 4: PMOP + E2 group). (B) Autophagy-related factors
  and the relative mRNA expression levels of AMPK and mTOR. *P<0.05 compared with
  control group; #P<0.05 compared with the PMOP group. PMOP, Postmenopausal osteoporosis;
  ZGZT, Zhuanggu Zhitong; E2, estrogen.'
