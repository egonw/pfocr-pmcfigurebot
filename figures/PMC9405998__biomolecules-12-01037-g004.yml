caption: ER stress induces Notch2 signaling via the ATF4 pathway in cultured human
  GLCs. Human GLCs were transfected with siATF4 or negative control siRNA for 24 h
  and then treated with tunicamycin (2.5 μg/mL) for 24 h. The expression levels of
  (A) Notch2, (B) Hey2, and (C) ATF4 mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR and normalized
  to that of GAPDH. (D) The protein expression level of ATF4 in GLCs was analyzed
  by western blotting. β-Actin was used as a loading control. (E) Quantitative analysis
  of western blotting. Values represent means ± SEM, relative to the mean control
  value. The letters denote significant differences between groups. Tm, tunicamycin.
