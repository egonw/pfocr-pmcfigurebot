caption: DMC-induced apoptosis was mediated by the modulation of the NF-κB cellular
  signaling pathway in FaDu cells. Cultured FaDu cells were stimulated with 10 and
  20 µM DMC for 24 h. Thereafter, total proteins, and cytosolic and nucleus protein
  fractions were extracted from FaDu cells for western blot using phospho- and total
  NFκB antibodies. In addition, β-actin and Lamin B1 were used for normalization of
  cytosolic and nucleus fractions, respectively. To perform a nucleus translocation,
  FaDu cells were stimulated with 10 or 20 µM DMC for 24 h at 37 ℃. After the treatments,
  FaDu cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-NFκB antibodies. Thereafter,
  stained cells were imaged by a laser confocal scanning microscope system (Leica
  Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). DMC-induced apoptosis was mediated by the inhibition
  of NF-κB translocation from cytosol to nucleus through the suppression of NF-κB
  phosphorylation in FaDu cells. (A) DMC suppresses the phosphorylation of NF-κB in
  FaDu cells; (B) the NF-κB extracted from nucleus of FaDu cells are reduced by the
  treatment of DMC; (C) DMC suppresses the nucleus transition of NF-κB from cytosol
  in FaDu cells. DMC, demethoxycurcumin.
