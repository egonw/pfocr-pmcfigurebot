caption: Summary scheme of the mechanisms underlying the preventive effect of β-glucan
  on necrotizing enterocolitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis is characterized by disturbed
  gut microbiota, destroyed gut barrier, activated TLR4, and excessive inflammatory
  cytokine levels. -glucan suppressed the TLR4-NF-B signaling pathway, and thus decreased
  inflammatory cytokine levels induced by necrotizing enterocolitis. β-glucan protected
  intestinal epithelial barrier disruption induced by necrotizing enterocolitis, via
  up-regulating the tight junction protein expressions, including ZO-1, Occludin,
  and Claudin-1
article_title: β-glucan protects against necrotizing enterocolitis in mice by inhibiting
  intestinal inflammation, improving the gut barrier, and modulating gut microbiota.
