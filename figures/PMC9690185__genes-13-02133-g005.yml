caption: Oridonin regulated GSDMD-mediated cell pyroptosis via the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling
  pathway. (A) Representative western blot results of GSDMD-FL, GSDMD-N, IL-1β and
  IL-18 from each group. (B) Densitometric quantification of GSDMD-N and GSDMD-FL
  based on (A). (C) Analysis of the densitometric measurements of IL-1β and IL-18
  based on (A). (D) Concentrations of IL-1β in cell supernatants from each group.
  (E) Concentrations of IL-18 in cell supernatants from each group. (F) Concentrations
  of LDH in cell supernatants from each group. The protein level was standardized
  using GAPDH. The mixed inhibitor contained 5 μM Bay-117082 (NF-κB inhibitor), MCC950
  (NLRP3 inhibitor) and VX-765 (caspase-1 inhibitor). All samples are from NRCMs.
  In all cases, the data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
