caption: 'SKI improved HK-2 cell migration in response to TGF-β1 treatment: (a) cell
  wound healing measurement at 0 h, (b) cell wound healing measurement at 24 h, (c)
  statistical analysis of the scratch test, and (d) fluorescence staining with phalloidin
  (400×). Phalloidin staining showed that cells treated with DMEM displayed a normal
  organized architecture, while spindle-shaped changes could be observed in cells
  stimulated by TGF-β1. Morphological changes alleviated after using SKI.'
