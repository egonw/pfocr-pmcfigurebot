figure_title: Functional enrichment and PPI network construction of DEGs
caption: A, B Bubble plots show the results of GO functional enrichment and KEGG signaling
  pathway enrichment of DEGs. C The PPI network of the DEGs. Nodes represent proteins,
  edges represent interactions between proteins, and the intensity of the color indicates
  the degree of interaction of each protein. Proteins with more interaction were shown
  in the center of the network.
