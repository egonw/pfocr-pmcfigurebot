caption: 'Impact of (+)-ABX on xenograft model in nude mice. A Ex vivo tumor imaging.
  B The tumor weight (n = 6). C Tumor growth curve plotted based on tumor volume measurements
  (n = 6). D Curve depicting changes in mouse body weight (n = 6). E Representative
  pathological sections of major organs and tumor tissues stained with H&E (n = 6).
  Scale bar, 50 μm. F IHC staining of Ki67, AKT, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, cleaved-caspase
  9, LC3A, and Beclin1 expression in tumor tissues. Scale bar, 100 and 50 μm. G Quantification
  of integrated optical density of IHC staining in (E). n = 3 (Additional file : Table
  S2). Data were presented as means ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
  compared with the control. Information was collected from a minimum of three independent
  experiments'
