caption: 'CTSC affects tumorigenesis in NSCLC in vivo. A. H1975-mock and H1975-CTSC
  cells are subcutaneously injected into both flanks of BALB/c nude mice (n = 5).
  Representative images showing the tumor-bearing mice and sizes of tumors injected
  with H1975-mock and H1975-CTSC cells at 18 days. Representative images of the removed
  tumors. B, C. Tumor growth is significantly increased in the CTSC overexpression
  group. D. Representative images of H&E, Ki-67, and CTSC staining. Magnification:
  × 400. E. H1975-shCtrl and H1975-shCTSC cells are subcutaneously injected into both
  flanks of BALB/c nude mice (n = 5). Representative images showing the tumor-bearing
  mice and sizes of tumors injected with H1975-shCtrl and H1975-shCTSC cells at 20
  days. Representative images of the removed tumors. F, G. Tumor weight and volume
  are evaluated after dissecting tumors from the mice in each group. Tumor growth
  is significantly impaired in the CTSC knockdown group. H. Representative images
  of H&E, Ki-67, and CTSC staining. Magnification: × 400. Scale bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.1.'
