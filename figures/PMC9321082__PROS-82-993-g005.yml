caption: Distinct molecular signatures in each NMF subtype in The Cancer Genome Atlas.
  (A) Unbiased Reactome pathway enrichment analysis depicts distinct biology associated
  with each NMF subtype. (B) Heatmap shows mean expression levels of some enriched
  pathway in (A). (C) Representative genes from different gene signatures. Red, high
  expression; blue, low expression. (D) Radar plot shows the overall patterns of gene
  signatures in (C). NMF, nonnegative matrix factorization; TMB, tumor mutation burden
