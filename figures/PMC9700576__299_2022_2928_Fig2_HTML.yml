caption: Incidence of glossy cells and link with alkaloid accumulation. A Frequency
  of glossy cells over time. Each data point represents at least 300 individual cells
  from three independent experimental series. B Factors modulating the incidence of
  glossy cells probed at day 6 after the respective treatment. The relative change
  in incidence compared to the control is indicated by a colour table. The artificial
  auxin Picloram was administered in a concentration of 10 µM, and the phytohormones
  Salicylic Acid (SA) and Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) at 100 µM. The role of the membrane-localised
  NADPH oxidase Respiratory burst oxidase Homologue (RboH) was assessed either by
  inhibition through 20 µM diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or activation by 100 µM of aluminium
  chloride (Al). Data were collected from three independent experimental series, scoring
  between 1100 and 2300 individual cells per data point. C Position of the taxol precursor
  baccatin III and the shunt product baccatin VI in the taxol pathway and working
  hypothesis on their regulation. D Content of baccatin III and baccatin VI in response
  to factors that modulate the incidence of glossy cells
