caption: CC-115 regulates GSDME-dependent pyroptosis through Akt/Bax signaling. (A)
  Western blotting of Akt, Bax, and Cyt-c in A549 cells treated with or without CC-115
  (5 μM) and/or SC79 (5 μM). (B) Representative images of the mitochondrial membrane
  potential signal in A549 cells determined using the JC-10 assay in the indicated
  groups (scale bar, 50 μm). (C) Representative bright field images of A549 cells
  in the indicated groups (scale bar, 50 μm). (D, E) Release of LDH and secretion
  of IL-1β in A549 cells as determined using ELISA. (F) Analysis of caspase-3 and
  GSDME expression using western blotting in A549 cells in the indicated groups. ***P
