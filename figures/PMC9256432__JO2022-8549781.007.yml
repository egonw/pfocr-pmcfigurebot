caption: Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation reversed the changes in cell invasion ability
  and apoptosis caused by TNFRSF9 knockdown. (a, b) The invasion ability of MGF-7
  cells (a) or ZR-75-30 cells (b) transfected with si-TNFRSF9 and with or without
  p38 MAPK-IN-1 was determined using Transwell invasion assay. Quantitative analysis
  of the invasive cells in Transwell assays was also performed (lower right panel).
  (c, d) Apoptosis assays of MGF-7 cells (c) or ZR-75-30 cells (d) transfected with
  si-TNFRSF9 and with or without p38 MAPK-IN-1 and the quantitative analysis of the
  apoptosis cells (lower right panel). ∗∗p < 0.01.
