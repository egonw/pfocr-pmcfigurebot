figure_title: KY19334 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and suppresses steatohepatitis
  in NASH-induced mice
caption: a–f C57BL/6 mice fed a NCD or HFD + CCl4 were orally administered KY19334,
  selonsertib, or ocaliva at 25 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks (n = 10 per group). The liver
  tissues were analyzed by various histochemical and biochemical methodologies. a
  Representative images of Cxxc5 and β-catenin (left panel) and quantitative analyses
  of IHC staining for cytosolic Cxxc5 and β-catenin (right panel). b Relative mRNA
  expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling target genes (Tcf7l2, Glp-1, Axin2, Fosl1,
  and Wisp1) (n = 3). c Representative gross images of the liver. d Representative
  histological images of H&E staining and ORO staining (left panel). Quantification
  of the TG concentration in the liver tissue (right panel). Scale bars, 100 µm. e
  Representative IHC images of Pparγ-stained liver tissue (left panel). Quantification
  of Pparγ-positive cells (right panel). Scale bar, 100 µm. f Relative mRNA expression
  of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis (n = 3). Data represent the mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 determined by Student’s t test.
