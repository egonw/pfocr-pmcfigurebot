figure_title: Effect of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) on the expression
  of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)
caption: HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μM of 6-MSITC for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, or
  48 hours (A), or with indicated concentrations of 6-MSITC for 6 and 9 hours (B).
  The whole-cell lysates were used to detect Nrf2, Keap1, NQO1, HO-1 and β-actin by
  Western blot analysis with their respective antibodies. Densitometry of the blots
  was performed using the LumiVision Imager software. Histograms show the densitometric
  analysis of Nrf2, Keap1, NQO1 or HO-1 normalized to β-actin. The data were from
  triplicate tests. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.05.
