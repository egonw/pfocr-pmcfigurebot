caption: 'LIG inhibited TF expression by the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. (A)
  TF was examined via Western blotting at 4 h after treatment with TNF-α (0.01 μg/mL),
  LIG (10 µM) or LIG with wortmannin (10 µM). (B) Akt and phosphorylated Akt were
  examined via Western blotting. (C) Phosphorylated IκBα was examined via Western
  blotting. (D) NF-κB/p65 and phosphorylated p65 were examined via Western blotting.
  N.S., no significance, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. the unstimulated
  group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. TNF-α alone group. (n = 3). (E)
  EA.hy926 Cells treatment with 10 µM LIG for 1 h, followed by 25 min stimulation
  of TNF-α (0.01 μg/mL). Analysis of NF-κB/p65 nuclear transfer in EA.hy926 cells
  via cellular immunochemistry. Scale bar, 20 µm. Representative images from three
  individual experiments with similar results were shown.'
