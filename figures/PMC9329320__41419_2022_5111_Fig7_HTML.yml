figure_title: TME-derived lactate promotes metastasis of normoxic CSCs depending on
  oxidative metabolism pathway
caption: a Schematic illustration of the proposed model. Normoxic CSCs get more access
  to the blood vessels than hypoxic CSCs. Hypoxic cell-secreted lactate in the TME
  could be ingested by normoxic CSCs to promote their OXPHOS and thus enhance their
  metastatic capacity.

  through PGC-1Î±-mediated oxidative phosphorylation.
