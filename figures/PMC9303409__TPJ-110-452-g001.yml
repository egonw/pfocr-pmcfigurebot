caption: Proposed model to explain how Pi content and defense responses are integrated
  for modulation of resistance to infection by fungal pathogens in Arabidopsis. Treatment
  with high Pi, MIR399 overexpression, and loss‐of‐function of PHO2 would trigger
  Pi accumulation, which, in turn, would increase ROS and hormone (SA and JA) levels
  in Arabidopsis leaves for the induction of genes involved in the SA and JA signaling
  pathways. Upon pathogen infection, the expression of genes involved in the SA pathway
  and the ERF1/PDF1.2 branch of the JA pathway would be further induced, while genes
  in the MYC2/VSP2 branch of the JA pathway are repressed. The interplay between Pi,
  ROS, and hormones would allow the plant to mount an effective immune response. Although
  crosstalk between ROS and hormonal pathways has been described (Herrera‐Vásquez
  et al., ; Xia et al., ), further investigation is needed to elucidate (i) the exact
  mechanisms by which Pi content modulates ROS production and hormone content and
  (ii) how these signaling pathways communicate with each other in the coordinated
  regulation of Pi homeostasis and immune responses.
