figure_title: EDN1 was the downstream effector of ARHGEF2
caption: A Heatmap of the differentially expressed genes after ARHGEF2 knocked down
  in the HepG2 cells. B The chord diagram was plotted by GO enrichment analysis. C
  GSEA plot, demonstrating a significant correlation between the EDN1 expression levels
  and sprouting angiogenesis from published datasets. D Go enrichment analysis revealed
  the EDN1-associated signaling pathways (TCGA). E A GESA plot regarding the correlation
  between EDN1 expression and the VEGF signaling pathway. F The effect of ARHGEF2
  knockdown on EDN1 protein and mRNA level were examined by Western blot and qRT-PCR
  in HepG2 cell lines. G EDN1 protein and mRNA level after ARHGEF2 overexpression
  were detected in MHCC97H cell lines. H Western blot was used to detect EDN1 levels
  after ZNF263 and ARHGEF2 were knocked down under ER stress. I EDN1 levels were examined
  after ARHGEF2 knockdown in ZNF263 overexpressing cell lines.
