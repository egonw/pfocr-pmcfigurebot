caption: TLR-NF-κB signaling in progression or regression of cancer. Upon recognition
  of a ligand, TLRs transduce signals through a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway,
  or alternatively a MyD88-independent TRIF-activating pathway. Upon activation of
  the MyD88-dependent pathway, adapter molecule TIRAP transduces signals to MyD88.
  MyD88 activates IRAK1 and IRAK4. Activated IRAK1 and IRAK4 lead to activation of
  TRAF6. TRAF6 activates the TAK1 complex. The TAK1 complex activates the IKK complex
  comprised of NEMO, IKKα, and IKKβ. IKK complex activation leads to phosphorylation
  of IKβα, a protein responsible for sequestering NF-κB to the cytoplasm. Once activated,
  NF-κB translocates to the nucleus to activate genes that can promote or inhibit
  tumorigenesis. NF-κB also can be activated through TRIF, notably through TLR3. TRIF
  activation results in RIP1 and TRAF6 activation. Through RIP1 and TRAF6, the TAK1
  complex is activated. Following TAK1 complex activation, subsequent steps in NF-κB
  signaling are shared between the two pathways. Created with Biorender.com.
