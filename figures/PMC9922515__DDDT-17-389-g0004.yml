caption: 'The influence of solanine on cell invasion, mitigation, cycle arrest and
  apoptosis in vitro. (A) The effect of solanine on cell invasion using the transwell
  technique. (B) The mitigation of gastric cancer cells was determined by the wound
  healing assay. (C) Cell distribution in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases was quantified
  by the flow cytometry analysis. (D) The effect of solanine on cell apoptosis was
  analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3) and
  P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ##P < 0.01 compared to Ctr.'
