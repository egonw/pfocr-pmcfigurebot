caption: Inhibition of PDF induces membrane hyperpolarization(A) Time-dependent changes
  (log2FC) in the translation (left) and steady-state protein level (right) of the
  regulated genes in the Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathway (I), the electron transfer
  complexes (II), the acid response pathway (III), and the alkaline response pathway
  (IV) upon PDF inhibition.(B) Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence spectra measured with
  CAG12184 cells before (solid black) and after 15 min of treatment with 4 μg/mL ACT
  (solid blue), and after an additional 5 min of 5 μM CCCP treatment (open black).
  The ThT spectrum without cells is shown in gray.(C) Membrane potential of CAG12184
  cells mock-treated (black) and treated with ACT (blue), measured by the fluorescence
  intensity of ThT. The values for three replicates are shown, and the line represents
  the mean.
