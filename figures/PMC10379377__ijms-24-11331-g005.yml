caption: 'Inhibition of the GPR109A/p38/NF-κB signaling pathway blocked the release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by low glucose plus BHB. (A–C), supernatant
  concentrations of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in
  AMs from each treatment (n = 5). Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
  One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences among groups. * 0.01 < p < 0.05
  vs. NG; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01 vs. NG; # 0.01 < p < 0.05 vs. LG + BHB; ## 0.001 < p
  < 0.01 vs. LG + BHB. NG, normal glucose; LG, low glucose.'
