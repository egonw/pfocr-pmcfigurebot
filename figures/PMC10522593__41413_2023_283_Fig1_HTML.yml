caption: Aging activates Notch signaling genes in skeletal stem cells. a Schematic
  of experimental workflow for scRNAseq of young adult (~3-month-old) and middle-aged
  (~12-month-old) bone stromal (CD31−CD45−TER119−) and hematopoietic and endothelial
  compartments (CD31+CD45+TER119−) from hindlimb bone tissue sorted and combined at
  a 1:1 ratio, then processed for scRNAseq. b scRNAseq UMAP-based visualization of
  stromal, hematopoietic, and endothelial bone and bone marrow populations with 24
  clusters. Young n = 15 225 cells, Middle-aged n = 8 831 cells. The pink outline
  indicates the stromal compartment and the green outline indicates the hematopoietic
  and endothelial compartment. c Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the package
  escape 1.4.1. GSEA analysis was performed on the stromal hematopoietic, and endothelial
  compartments separately. Split Violin plot shows normalized enrichment score (NES)
  for hallmark_notch_signaling from the H:hallmark gene sets between young and middle-aged
  stromal (FDR = 1.830 372e−07, young median NES = 536.031, middle-aged median NES = 927.393),
  hematopoietic (FDR = 1.032 392e-02, young median NES = 939.566, middle-aged median
  NES = 899.742), and endothelial populations (FDR = 1.000 000, young median NES = 695.455,
  middle-aged median NES = 437.276) Wilcoxon test. d Dotplot showing expression of
  Notch signaling pathway genes in cluster 22, which is mainly comprised of Lepr+
  expressing SSPCs between middle-aged and young mice. e SSPCs were subjected to ATAC
  sequencing. Compared to young SSPCs, chromatin in middle-aged SSPCs was more accessible
  around the transcriptional start site (TSS) in genes associated with Notch signaling
