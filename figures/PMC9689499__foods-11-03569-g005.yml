caption: 'Metabolic network analysis of Hep G2 cells treated with GNR-L for 12 h:
  (a) all significant changed metabolites, (b) carbohydrate-related metabolites, (c)
  phosphorylate-related metabolites, (d) amino acid-related metabolites, (e) fatty
  acid-related metabolites. (f) Pathway enrichment analysis of significantly changed
  metabolites. Significantly changed pathways based on enrichment and topology analysis
  are shown. The x-axis represents pathway enrichment, and the y-axis represents pathway
  impact. Large sizes and yellow colors represent major pathway enrichment and high
  pathway impact values, respectively.'
