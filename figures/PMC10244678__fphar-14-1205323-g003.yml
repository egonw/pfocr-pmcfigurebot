caption: BDX-01 supplementation alleviated mouse DSS-induced colitis. (A) Protocol
  for BDX-01 supplement to mouse DSS-induced colitis model. The DSS, Mesalazine, and
  BDX-01 groups were administered 100 μL BHI medium or 100 μL BHI medium plus 100 μL
  BDX-01 culture containing 1 × 109 CFU/mL, respectively, through an intragastric
  cannula for 15 days. All mice received 2.5% DSS in drinking water between days 7
  and 15. (B) % BW change during DSS treatment relative to baseline (day 0). (C) DAI
  scores during DSS treatment. (D) Representative colon morphology and length. (E)
  Comparison of colon lengths among the four groups. (F) Representative HE-stained
  histological sections (100× and 200×). (G) Comparison of colonic histopathological
  scores among the four groups. Statistical analysis was performed in comparison with
  DSS group mice. Data represent the means ± SD (n = 6–8). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 (unpaired t-test, Kruskal–Wallis test, and one-way
  ANOVA, followed by post hoc test).
