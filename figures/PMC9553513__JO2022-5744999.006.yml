  (n = 3). (a) Quantification of autophagy-associated proteins in HepG2 and HL-7702
  by PCR. (b) WT profile. (c) Quantification of autophagy-associated proteins in HepG2
  and HL-7702 by WT. Comparison of two groups ∗P < 0.05. (d) Staining of invasion
  cells (×200). (e) Counting of invasive cells. (f) Quantification of autophagy-associated
  proteins by PCR under the intervention of miR-3651 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. (g) Western
  blot image. (h) Quantification of autophagy-associated proteins by WT under the
  intervention of miR-3651 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Compared with the 3651-NC group ∗P <
