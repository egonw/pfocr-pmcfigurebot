caption: ROP16 inhibits cGAS-STING signaling dependent on the NLS domain. RAW264.7
  cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding truncated versions of ROP16 and
  host cGAS using the Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System, and they were harvested
  24 h and 48 h post-transfection for qRT-PCR and Western blotting with the indicated
  antibodies, respectively; (A) transfected RAW264.7 cells were lysed and indicated
  proteins were analyzed using Western blotting; (B) ImageJ densitometry analysis
  for p-TBK1 relative to total TBK1 and (C) p-IRF3 relative to total IRF3; (D–H) the
  transcription levels of IFN-β, IL-6, IL-12b, ISG15, and ISG56 were quantified relative
  to that in RAW264.7 cells transfected with empty vector. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. The red line presented the average
  mRNA expression of Wild-type of ROP16 protein expressed group. + added. Statistical
  analysis was performed using Student’s t-test.
