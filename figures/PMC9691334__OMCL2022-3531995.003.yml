caption: 'The protective effect of TF3 on erastin-induced ferroptosis in cultured
  OA chondrocytes. (a) Chondrocyte ferroptosis was detected by PI staining; representative
  images are shown. (b) Quantitative analysis of PI positive percentage. (c) Lipid
  ROS levels were determined by fluorescent staining; representative images are shown.
  (d) Quantitative analysis of lipid ROS levels in chondrocytes. (e) Levels of FTH-1
  and Gpx4 in chondrocytes after stimulation by different concentrations of erastin
  (5 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM) for 24 hrs were measured by western blotting. (f) Quantitative
  analysis for expression of FTH-1 and Gpx4 in erastin-treated chondrocytes. (g) Chondrocytes
  were pretreated with TF3 for 2 hours and then stimulated with erastin (5 μM) for
  24 hrs. The levels of FTH-1, Gpx4, and Slc7a11 were examined by western blot; representative
  bands are shown. (h) Quantitative analysis for the expression of FTH-1, Gpx4, and
  Slc7a11 in erastin-treated chondrocytes pretreated with TF3. (i) The Fe2+ level
  in mitochondria was examined by Mito-Ferrogreen staining; representative images
  are shown. (j) Quantitative analysis of Fe2+ level. The results are presented as
  the means ± SD of three independent experiments, and statistical significance was
  determined by one-way ANOVA. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, #p < 0.0001; n.s.:
  no significant difference. NC: chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM-F12 for 24 hrs.
  Erastin: chondrocytes were treated with 5 μM erastin for 24 hrs. Erastin+15TF3/Erastin+30TF3:
  chondrocytes were pretreated with different concentrations of TF3 (15 μM and 30 μM)
  for 2 hrs and then incubated with erastin for 24 hrs. FTH1: ferritin heavy chain
  1; Gpx4: glutathione peroxidase 4; Slc7a11: light chain subunit of the cystine/glutamate
  anticarrier.'
