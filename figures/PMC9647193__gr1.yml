caption: A flowchart showing the workflow of CommPath. CommPath infers pathway-mediated
  intercellular communication chain from single-cell transcriptomics. (1) CommPath
  curated LR molecule interaction database based on CellPhoneDB and FANTOM5 database
  and takes expression profile and cell annotation labels from scRNA-seq data as input
  to infer potential LR associations. (2) CommPath screens pathway-associated LR interactions
  by searching in a variety of signaling pathway databases. (3) CommPath infers LR
  interactions and relevant biological pathways among cell types, enables comparison
  between two conditions, and meanwhile provides diverse representations.
