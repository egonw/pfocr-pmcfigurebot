figure_title: HDAC4 promotes the progression of GC via the p38 MAPK signalling pathway
caption: a Top 20 signalling pathway maps enriched in the RNA Sequence and b TCGA
  STAD databases by GSEA. c Western blot analysis was used to detect the effect of
  HDAC4 knockdown on the expression of MAPK-related signalling components in GC cells;
  GAPDH is used as a loading control. d, f, g Anisomycin reverses the inhibitory effect
  of HDAC4 knockdown on the proliferation of GC cells as shown by the colony formation
  and CCK-8 assays. e Anisomycin reverses the inhibitory effect of HDAC4 knockdown
  on GC cell migration and invasion as shown in Matrigel Transwell assays of GC cells.
  h The expression of MEKK1/2/3/4 was detected by western blotting in GC cells. i
  Immunohistochemistry analysis of MEKK3 in subcutaneous tumour tissue. Scale bar,
  50 μm. j In Sh-HDAC4 cells, MEKK3 was overexpressed to detect p-p38 expression level.
  **P < 0.01.
