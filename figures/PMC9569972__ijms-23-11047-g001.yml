caption: 'Biogenesis and Exosomes-Uptake. 1. Formation of early endosomes from the
  TGN and EVs-uptake. 2. Formation of MVB through ESCRT-dependent and independent
  methods. 3. Different pathways of ILV inside of the parent cell: degradation by
  lysosome or secretion to extracellular space. 4. Recognition of EVs by receptor
  cell and internalization through different means. 5. Fate of internalized EVs: release
  of cargo into a recipient cell to induce effect, degradation through the lysosome
  pathway, or recycling to repeat the cycle. EVs: extracellular vesicles; ILV: intraluminal
  vesicles; MVB: multivesicular body; RAB: ras related in brain GTPase; TGN: trans
  golgi network.'
