caption: Enrichment of WNT/β-catenin pathway. (A) Gene expression data from three
  cisplatin-sensitive cell lines were treated with solvent or cisplatin before collecting
  mRNA for microarray analysis. PGSEA scores were calculated for all replicates of
  the three cell lines (nine in total). Using a random forest classifier, the most
  relevant pathways that explain cisplatin response were determined. (B) All cell
  lines were analyzed using PGSEA, and the scores were analyzed by hierarchically‐clustered
  heatmap (seaborn.clustermap). GI50 values were adopted from Miow et al. . (C) Data
  from two ovarian cancer patient cohorts were analyzed via ssGSEA. Scores for specific
  pathways were compared. (D‐F) Cells were treated with different concentrations of
  cisplatin for 24 h before lysis. Lysates were used for SDS-PAGE separation following
  western blotting using respective antibodies.
