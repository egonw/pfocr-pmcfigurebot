caption: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of ERFs, SAGs and tapetum development-related
  key transcription factors after ethylene treatment. (A) Relative expression of EIN2,
  EIN3, ERFs and SAGs genes in the inflorescence of Col after ethylene treatment for
  24 h. (B) The expression of the five key transcription factor genes in tapetum development
  is reduced after ethylene treatment. Relative expression of AMS, DYT1, TDF1, MS188,
  and MS1 in the inflorescence of Col-0 after ethylene treatment for 24 h. Col treated
  with air for 24 h was used as a mock. Gene expression was relative to that of the
  mock. β-tubulin was used as an internal control for normalization. Data are mean
  ± SEM of 3 biological replicates with technical duplicates for each. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 (t-test).
