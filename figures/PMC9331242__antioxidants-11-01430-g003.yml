caption: 'Butein attenuates apoptotic cell death in H2O2-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.
  The cells were treated with butein and/or H2O2 (a) Nuclear staining was performed
  by Hoechst staining. The arrow indicates apoptotic cells with nuclear condensation
  using cells that were treated with butein and/or H2O2. The cells in at least 10
  fields (30 cells per field) were counted in each group. (b) The percentage of apoptotic
  cells versus total cells is shown as the apoptotic index. (c) Western blot analysis
  for the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins including Bcl-2, Bax, pro-
  and cleaved caspase 3, and β-actin (loading control). The band densities of the
  ratio of Bcl-2/Bax (d) and pro- (e) and cleaved (f) caspase 3 proteins were calculated
  with HD imaging software. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM in triplicate.
  # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 vs. control group. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs.
  H2O2-only group. Cont; control, Bu; butein. Scale bar, 100 μm.'
