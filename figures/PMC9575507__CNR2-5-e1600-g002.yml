caption: Effect of Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) on migration
  of MCF‐7 cells. (A) MCF‐7 cells were cultures in monolayer, wound scratch was generated
  using 10 μl pipette tip and wound closure was observed for 24 h. Images were captured
  at 0 and 48 h. The area of wound closure were measured, percentage of wound closure
  was calculated and represented in the form of bar graph. (B) MCF‐7 cells were treated
  with either vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) or 20 μg/ml of CSMLE and seeded on the upper
  chamber of transwell inserts. DMEM with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant and
  cells were allowed to migrate toward the lower chamber. Number of migrated cells
  was counted and difference in the number of migrated cells was represented as bar
  graph. ***p < .05 versus control
