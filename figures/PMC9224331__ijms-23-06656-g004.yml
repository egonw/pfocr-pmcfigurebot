caption: Heatmap of gene expression patterns involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway in A192−1, YL−1 and YF−2. The heatmap was constructed according to the FPKM
  average values. The color scale represents the highest and lowest levels of expression,
  and the rows and columns in the heatmap represent samples and genes, respectively.
  The asterisks represent significant differences in both A192−1 and YF−2 petals (p
  < 0.05).
