caption: Optimization of Enriched TE-NSPs. (a,b) Confocal reconstructions of representative
  constructs at 14 DIV labeled via immunocytochemistry to denote all neurons/axons
  (β-tubulin III, purple) and dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red), with nuclear counterstain
  (Hoechst, blue). Both constructs demonstrated the desired cytoarchitecture consisting
  of discrete cell bodies and axonal regions. (a) A construct generated with neurons
  isolated from the ventral mesencephalon absent in any enrichment process. (b) A
  construct containing a neuronal population that was enriched for GFP+ dopaminergic
  neurons using FACS. (c) Viability assay on enriched TE-NSPs showing live cells/processes
  (green) and the nuclei of dead cells (red). (d) TE-NSPs generated using FACS-enriched
  aggregates (“Sorted 3D”) demonstrated a higher percentage of dopaminergic neurons
  in comparison to TE-NSPs plated with aggregates (“Non-sorted 3D”) or planar cultures
  (“Non-sorted 2D”) made from the standard midbrain isolation at 14 DIV (n = 5 TE-NSPs
  each group; Mann–Whitney test, p < 0.05). (e) One-way ANOVA (p = 0.3297) determined
  that all ECM cores and high growth factor media resulted in statistically equivalent
  TE-NSP length at 14 DIV (n = 6 TE-NSPs per group). Data presented as mean ± standard
  deviation. Scale bar (a) = 500 µm. Scale bar (b) = 250 µm.
