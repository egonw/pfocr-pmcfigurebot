caption: 'The expression of miR-320e in the exosomes secreted by the miR-320e mimic-transfected
  cells was significantly higher than that in the mimic NC group and the blank control.
  A: HUVECs were transfected using miR-320e mimics and the expression of miR-320e
  was detected. B: Lipid membrane of HUVECs marked by DiI; C: Microplate reader analysis
  showed that exosomes were also marked by DiI; D: As shown by using marked exosomes
  harvested from HUVECs and cocultured with HASMCs, HUVECs also showed red fluorescence;
  E-G: Western blotting and PCR showed that Wnt2 and β-catenin expression in the Exo-mimic
  group decreased compared to that of the control group. HUVECs: Human umbilical vein
  endothelial cells; HASMCs: Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells; PCR: Polymerase
  chain reaction. aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01.'
