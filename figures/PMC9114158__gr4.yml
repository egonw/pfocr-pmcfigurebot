caption: 'Top 20 enriched KEGG pathways in S. Enteritidis under sublethal ethanol
  stress. Note: Plot size indicates the number of differentially expressed genes in
  a pathway. Plot color indicates Qvalue, and means more obvious pathway enrichment
  as it becomes closer to bule. (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
