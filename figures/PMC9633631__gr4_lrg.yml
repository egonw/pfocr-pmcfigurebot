caption: YAP/TAZ Signalling pathway. In the active state, a kinase complex is formed
  between LATS1/2 and MST1/2 via stimulation of MOB, which inhibits the YAP/TAZ and
  further initiates nucleus transduction where YAP and TAZ bind with RUNX, TEAD whilst
  upregulating targeted genes CTGF, AXL, BIRC5, AREG, JAG1, that activates myofibroblasts
  ultimately exceeds ECM deposition.
