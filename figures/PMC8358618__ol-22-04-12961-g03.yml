caption: Nigericin enhances the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on slug expression
  in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Slug expression in SK-OV-3 cells after treatment
  with (A) the combination of nigericin and cisplatin, (B) nigericin only and (C)
  cisplatin only. (D) Effects of siRNA-induced slug knockdown on the expression levels
  of proteins associated with the Wnt signalling pathway. (E) Comparison of the effects
  of siRNA-induced slug knockdown and its combination with nigericin (5 µM) treatment
  on the expression levels of proteins associated with the Wnt signalling pathway.
  N.C., negative control; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

  of cisplatin on epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis by inhibiting slug expression
  via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.
