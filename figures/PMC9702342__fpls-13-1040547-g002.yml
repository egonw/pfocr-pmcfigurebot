caption: Functional annotation and pathway analysis of 21 whitefly proteins putatively
  interacting with CLCuMuV-AV1. (A) Gene ontology (GO) analysis of 21 whitefly proteins.
  The protein functional categories associated with the biological function (BF),
  molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC) and unknown function (UF) were
  defined using Blast2GO software available online at (https://www.blast2go.com/).
  (B) Metabolic pathway distribution of these proteins was analyzed by using online
  BlastKOALA tool in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database available
  online at (https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/).
article_title: Cotton leaf curl Multan virus differentially regulates innate antiviral
  immunity of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) vector to promote cryptic species-dependent
  virus acquisition.
