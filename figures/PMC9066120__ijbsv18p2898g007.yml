caption: MHO7 induced ICD in vivo. (A) Tumor sections were stained with CRT (green)
  and DAPI (blue). (B) Tumor sections were stained with HMGB1 (red) and DAPI (blue).
  (C) Tumor sections were stained with CD8+ (green) and DAPI (blue). (D) Tumor sections
  were stained with FOXP3+ (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 20 µm. (E) Diagram of
  procedure for vaccination assay in mice. (F) Tumor growth was measured in mice.
  Data was presented as mean ± SEM. (G) Tumor-free progression was measured in mice.
  Log rank test. (H) Overall survival was measured of mice. Log rank test. *P <0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P <0.001; ns=no significant.
