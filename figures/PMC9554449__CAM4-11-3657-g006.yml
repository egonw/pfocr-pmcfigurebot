caption: Transcriptome profiling after inhibition of three LHX6 isoform groups in
  HeLa cells. (A) RNA‐sequencing and analysis chart. The data were obtained from HeLa
  cells with specific silencing of three LHX6 isoform groups and their controls. (B)
  overlapped DEGs of three groups relative to their controls were shown and the four
  classified groups were depicted beside. (C‐E) Top 5 GO analyses terms of biological
  process and KEGG pathway enrichment results for the DEGs regulated by Sh‐LHX6EX(−12)‐particular
  group (C), Sh‐LHX6EX(+12)‐particular group (D), and Sh‐LHX6All‐particular group
  (E), respectively
