caption: Extracellular H2O2 and NO levels. (A) H460 cells’ extracellular H2O2 concentration
  at 0 h after treatment with PAM. (B) H460 cells’ extracellular H2O2 concentration
  at 0 h and after incubation for 4 h after treatment with PAM. (C) H460 cells’ extracellular
  NO concentration at 0 h after treatment with PAM. (D) H460 cells’ extracellular
  NO concentration at 0 h and after incubation for 4 h after treatment with PAM. (E)
  PC-9 cells’ extracellular H2O2 concentration at 0 h after treatment with PAM. (F)
  PC-9 cells’ extracellular H2O2 concentration at 0 h and after incubation for 4 h
  after treatment with PAM. (G) PC-9 cells’ extracellular NO concentration at 0 h
  after treatment with PAM. (H) PC-9 cells’ extracellular NO concentration at 0 h
  and after incubation for 4 h after treatment with PAM. Data represent the mean ±
  SD of three independent experiments. “ns” means no statistical difference. *** p
  < 0.001 with ANOVA compared with the control.
