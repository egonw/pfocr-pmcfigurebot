caption: Confirmation of predicted 2H enrichment of cholesterol. (a) Schematic representing
  the passage of 2H from U–2H–13C acetate through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.
  (b) GC–MS of purified cholesterol extracts in the negative ion collection mode.
  The highest peak height of each sample is normalized to 1. Depicted are the NA-cholesterol
  standard (black), 13C-cholesterol (blue), and 2H,13C-cholesterol (red). (c) rINEPT
  spectra of fully protonated 13C-labeled cholesterol (blue) and 2H–13C cholesterol
  (red). Resonances predicted to have 2H incorporation show dramatically reduced spectral
  intensity. (d) Comparison of 2H to 13C adiabatic RESPIRATIONCP (red) and 1H to 13C
  cross-polarization (blue) of 2H–13C cholesterol. In aggregate, these data suggest
  that 2H species largely remain bound to the same 13C site throughout cholesterol
  biosynthesis.
