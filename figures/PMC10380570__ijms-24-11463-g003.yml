caption: Enrichment analysis via map folder analysis using MetaCore software, performed
  with all differential proteins of Dsup- vs. Dsup+ proteomic analysis (basal condition).  also
  reports Pathway maps in Folder ‘Transcription regulation’ and Pathway maps in Folder
  ‘DNA-damage response’. Each histogram represents an enriched map folder/Pathway
  map associated with its p-value in −log10 and its related differential proteins.
