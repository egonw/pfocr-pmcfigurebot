caption: 'The regulatory status for GEd crops in countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
  It is based on the deregulation of SDN-1 crops (green), with some countries also
  deregulating SDN-1 and SDN-2 products, as described in the text. Countries with
  ongoing discussions (yellow) and regulated as GMOs (red). Note that regulation of
  GEd crops in China is under discussion, but does not use SDN terminology: at present
  GEd is still under GMO product safety management measures, but with less onerous
  requirements in the pathway to commercial approval.'
