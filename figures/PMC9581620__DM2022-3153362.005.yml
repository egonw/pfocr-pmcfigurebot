caption: Role of YTHDF2 silencing in activation of NF-κB and MAPK signalings within
  M1 macrophages. M0 macrophages were subject to transfection using YTHDF2 siRNAs
  or NC-siRNA for 24 h before 0-, 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min LPS+ INF-γ treatment.
  (a) p65, IκBα, and IKKα/β phosphorylation expression within NF-κB pathway were analyzed
  through WB, with VINCULIN being the endogenous reference. (b) Quantification of
  p65, IκBα, and IKKα/β phosphorylation levels in comparison with control. (c) p38,
  ERK, and JNK phosphorylation levels within MAPK pathway were analyzed through western
  blotting. (d) Quantification of p38, JNK, and ERK phosphorylation levels in comparison
  with control. (e, f) M0 macrophages subject to transfection using YTHDF2 siRNA or
  NC-siRNA were further exposed to BAY 11-7082, SB203580, or SP600125 (inhibitors
  for NF-κB, p38, and JNK pathways, separately) for a 2-h period, while non-treated
  cells served as blank control. Thereafter, LPS/IFN-γ was added to stimulate cells
  for a 6-h period. IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression were determined through qRT-PCR,
  with GAPDH being an endogenous reference. Data are denoted by mean ± S.E.M. (n =
  3). ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.
