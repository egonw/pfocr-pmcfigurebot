figure_title: ER stress upregulated ARHGEF2 expression through the activation of ZNF263
caption: A, B After knockdown of ZNF263 in the HepG2 cells (A) and the Hep3B cells
  (B), the levels of the ARHGEF2 protein and mRNA were detected using western blot
  and qRT-PCR. C, D After overexpression of ZNF263 in the MHCC97H cells (C) and the
  Huh7 cells (D), the levels of the ARHGEF2 protein and mRNA were detected using western
  blot and qRT-PCR. E Schematic representation of the putative three mutated (mut)
  ZNF263-binding sites in the promoter of the human ARHGEF2 gene from the Jaspar transcription
  profile database (http://jaspar.genereg.net). F Cells were co-transfected with ARHGEF2-luc,
  ARHGEF2-mut-R1, ARHGEF2-mut-R2, or ARHGEF2-mut-R3 together with pBabe-ZNF263 or
  pBabe. Relative luciferase activity was detected 24â€‰h after transfection. G IHC
  was performed on liver cancer and adjacent tissues of 138 patients, and the correlation
  between ARHGEF2 and ZNF263 was analyzed. H IHC staining index of ARHGEF2 in the
  ZNF263 high/low group. I, J Western blot (I) and qRT-PCR (J) was used to detect
  whether TM induced the changes of the ZNF263 and ARHGEF2 level after ZNF263 knocked
  down.
