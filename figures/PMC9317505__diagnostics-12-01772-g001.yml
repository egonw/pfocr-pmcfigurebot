caption: The possible mechanisms of ACTD-related pruritus. Inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-33 and IL-31, released from keratinocytes and immune cells transduce
  the itch sensation directly. Meanwhile, other inflammatory cytokines might participate
  in pruritus transduction through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Small-fiber
  neuropathy and opioid signaling also modulate the perception of pruriception. Therapies
  targeting the above mediators might reduce the intensity of itch in patient with
  ACTDs.
