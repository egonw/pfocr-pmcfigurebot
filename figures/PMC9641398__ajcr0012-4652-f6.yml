caption: CKB affected HOS cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis through the p53
  signaling pathway. A. The expression of p53 protein in HOS cells was assessed using
  western blotting; B. HOS cell proliferation was assessed using colony formation
  assay; C. HOS cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry; D. A Transwell experiment
  was performed to detect HOS cell invasion. **P < 0.01.
