figure_title: The localization and function of different molecules involved in the
  PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in the CE
caption: At the tissue level, different molecules affect CECs by modulating the PI3K/AKT
  signalling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Some factors are extracellular, such as
  wounds, some drugs (AST, CsA, AA, and C3G), and some biological or chemical stimulants
  (LPS, EPS, and NM). Moreover, some factors exist in cells, such as glucose, insulin,
  various growth factors related to hyperglycaemia, and hyperosmolarity, which is
  related to DED.
