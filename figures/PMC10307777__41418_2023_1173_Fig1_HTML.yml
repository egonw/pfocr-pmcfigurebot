figure_title: USP28 regulates the mevalonate pathway (MVP)
caption: a A431 cells expressing inducible shRNA sequences targeting USP28 (shUSP28#1
  and shUSP28#2) or non-targeting control (shRen) were treated with 1 µg/ml of doxycycline
  (DOX) for 96 h. Protein lysates were analysed for expression of USP28 and USP25
  by immunoblotting. Vinculin is shown as loading control. b Proteins differentially
  regulated by USP28 (shUSP28#1) silencing for 72 h in A431 cells [] (FDR ≤ 0.05 compared
  to shRen, total of 2200 proteins) were subjected to pathway analysis using the PANTHER
  tool. c Differential expression of MVP proteins as determined by proteomics analysis.
  Pathway map is coloured by log2FC (*q-value ≤ 0.05, n = 3). d A431 cells expressing
  an inducible shRNA sequence targeting USP28 (shUSP28#2) or non-targeting control
  (shRen) were treated with 1 µg/ml of doxycycline (DOX) for 120 h. Changes in gene
  expression were analysed and enrichment plots for gene sets mapping to direct ΔNP63
  targets and cholesterol biosynthesis are shown. e Validation of downregulation of
  mevalonate pathway genes following USP28 silencing using 1 µg/ml of doxycycline
  (DOX) for 96 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  (*p < 0.05, ****p < 0.0001, unpaired two-tailed t-test with FDR). f A431 cells expressing
  an inducible shRNA sequence targeting USP28 (shUSP28#2) or non-targeting control
  (shRen) were treated with 0.5 µg/ml of doxycycline (DOX) for 96 h. Expression of
  USP28 and HMGCS1 were analysed by immunoblotting. Actin is shown as loading control.
  g Overlap between genes downregulated by silencing of USP28 and SREBP2 in A431 cells.
  Among the 252 overlapping genes are 8 mevalonate pathway enzymes (boxed) that also
  showed downregulation in the proteomics dataset. h A431 cells were incubated with
  medium containing 25 mM [U13C]-glucose for 48 h. Metabolites were extracted and
  analysed by LC-MS. Fractions of labelled and unlabelled ubiquinone (CoQ10) and cholesterol
  are shown. Data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. i A431
  cells expressing inducible shRNA sequences targeting USP28 (shUSP28#1 and shUSP28#2)
  or non-targeting control (shRen) were treated with 1 µg/ml of doxycycline (DOX)
  for 120 h. During the last 48 h, cells were incubated with medium containing 25 mM
  [U13C]-glucose. Metabolites were extracted and analysed by LC-MS. Fractions of labelled
  and unlabelled ubiquinone (CoQ10) and cholesterol are shown. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD of three independent experiments (n.s. non-significant, *p < 0.05,
  ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s test).
