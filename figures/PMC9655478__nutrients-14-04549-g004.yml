caption: L-cit suppresses NF-κB signaling pathway induced by iron overload in mouse
  thymus. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran 50 mg/kg, and L-cit
  were given by gavage administration the dosage of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg/day. Immunoblot
  analyses were explored. (A,B) Immunoblot analyses of TNF-α. (A,C) Immunoblot analyses
  of IL-6. (A,D) Immunoblot analyses of IL-1β. (A,E) Immunoblot analyses of p-p65/p65.
  GAPDH was used as the loading control. Values represent mean ± SEM. of three independent
  experiments. Significant differences are represented by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns (not significant).
