caption: Genetic mapping of BA modulators and the identification of Ces1c as a potential
  regulator of plasma TUDCA levels(A) The genetic effects of the TUDCA QTL on chromosome
  8 on plasma TUDCA levels of the BXD animals at 30 min after a test meal. Plasma
  TUDCA concentrations (log2 transformed data) were compared between strains inheriting
  the genetic allele from the reference C57BL/6J strain at the QTL (indicated as B/B)
  and those inheriting from the DBA/2J strain (indicated as D/D). ∗∗∗p < 0.001 by
  two-tailed Student’s t test.(B) Heatmap presenting the correlations between the
  TUDCA levels across different biological compartments and phenotypic traits. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001, for Pearson correlation coefficient.(C) Systems genetics
  pipeline applied to filter for genes responsible for the plasma TUDCA QTL at T30
  by integrating 3 major criteria, that is, (1) whether genes have high-impact genetic
  variants or cis-eQTLs in the liver, (2) whether their liver expression level correlates
  with plasma TUDCA levels at T30, and (3) whether they associate with the primary
  BA biosynthesis (KEGG 0120) pathway in GMAD (). The numbers of genes that fulfill
  each or several of these criteria are listed in the Venn diagram.(D) Heatmap listing
  the genes under the plasma TUDCA QTL at T30 on chromosome 8 reveals the potential
  modulators of TUDCA. Only genes fulfilling at least 2 criteria were included in
  the heatmap. The first block of the heatmap represents whether the genes have high-impact
  variants or cis-eQTLs in liver transcriptome datasets of the BXDs. The second block
  (Corr) indicates the correlations between the liver expression of these genes and
  plasma TUDCA levels at T30 in CD or HFD. The third block shows the association between
  these genes and the primary BA biosynthesis pathway predicted by GMAD () in human,
  mouse, and rat. The last block shows the enrichment of the expression of these genes
  in the liver, retrieved from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/)
  (). r, Pearson correlation coefficient. GMAS, gene-module association score. Asterisk
  (∗p < 0.05) and hash (#) indicate statistical significance in correlation and GMAD,
  respectively. The 3 selected candidates are in bold and underlined. Full list of
  the 191 genes under the TUDCA QTL on chromosome 8 is in .(E) Zonation protein (left)
  or mRNA (right) profiles of key BA synthesis and transport genes, as well as candidate
  TUDCA modulators in the mouse liver. Protein or mRNA expression of each gene was
  scaled to 0–1.See also  and , , and .
