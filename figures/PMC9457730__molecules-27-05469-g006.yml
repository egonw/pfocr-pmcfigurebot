caption: Compound 2 causes A549 cell apoptosis. (A) After 72 h of corresponding compound
  2 treatment, A549 cells were collected and the apoptotic cell was detected by flow
  cytometry. (B) The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by compound 2. (C) The
  effects of a 72 h compound 2 treatment on apoptosis-related signaling pathway. (D)
  After compound 2 treatment for 72 h, caspase-3 activity was detected. (**) p < 0.01
  compared with the control group. Cont., DMSO control.
