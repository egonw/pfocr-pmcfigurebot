caption: 'The unigenes and differently expressed genes (DEGs) based on the leaf transcriptome
  data of Achnatherum inebrians plants in response to the presence of the Epichloë
  fungal endophyte under non-drought (CK), moderate (MD), and severe (SD) drought
  treatments. Note: (A): The sample similarity analysis of all unigenes detected in
  the leaves of Epichloë symbiotic (EI) and non-symbiotic (EF) plants under CK, MD,
  and SD moisture treatments. (B): The number of all and up/down-regulated DEGs in
  EI plants versus EF plants under CK, MD, and SD moisture treatments. (C): Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of DEGs in response
  to the Epichloë endophyte under CK treatment; the dot color represents the enrichment
  q-value of the related pathway, and the dot scale indicates the number of DEGs in
  the pathway.'
