caption: Effect of azilsartan on cell cycle phase distribution of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cell lines determined by flow cytometric analysis. (A,C) Representative
  histograms for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, respectively, after
  PI staining. (B,D) Percentage of cells in the various cell cycle phases in MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, respectively. Data represent mean Â± SD,
  n = 3. Significant difference was analyzed by Two-way ANOVA test, where * p < 0.05,
  *** p < 0.001 compared to untreated cells.
