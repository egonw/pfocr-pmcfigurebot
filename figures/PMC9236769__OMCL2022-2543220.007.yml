caption: 'FGFR1 knockdown impairs tumor growth and angiogenesis of sorafenib-resistant
  HCC cells in vivo. (a and b) Pilot studies of tumor xenograft experiments were performed
  for HUH-7/R cells with 3 groups of treatment: i.e., vehicle control; sorafenib+DJ-1;
  and sorafenib+DJ-1+shFGFR1. 5 × 106 cells per injection were injected subcutaneously
  into two flanks of nude mice (n = 3), and tumor weight (a) and tumor volume (b)
  were recorded. Tumor volume was checked twice to three times weekly using a digital
  caliper. (c and d) Tumor cell angiogenesis was examined in the chicken chorioallantoic
  membrane (CAM) model. Both HUH-7 and HUH-7/R cells were mixed with ECDHCC-1 cells
  at the ratio of 1 : 1 and then treated at different conditions: (1) cells+control;
  (2) cells+DJ-1; (3) cells+corafenib; (4) cells+sorafenib+DJ-1; and (5) cells+sorafenib+DJ-1+shFGFR1.
  In CAM model, total vessel length (c) and density (d) were measured at the end of
  the experiments.'
