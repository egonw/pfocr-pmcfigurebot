caption: 'Effect of dietary supplementation with Cys on the response of tibialis anterior
  (TA) muscle to treatment with APAP for 18 d. Ctrl and APAP diets were supplemented
  with alanine (Ala) or cysteine (Cys). Ala was added to make diets iso-nitrogenous
  to Cys diets. The APAP-Cys group was fed ad libitum. The three other groups were
  pair-fed with the APAP-Cys group. (A) Mass of the two TA muscles. (B) Cross-sectional
  area (CSA) of muscle fibers. Scale bar = 50 µm. (C) Total GSH concentration in the
  TA. (D) Expression of the ATF4-dependent gene Gadd45. Total RNA extracted from the
  liver was analyzed by reverse transcription RT-qPCR. Each bar shows the median with
  interquartile and dots are individual values. * p ≤ 0.05; *** p ≤ 0.001 vs. PF-Ala;
  # p ≤ 0.05; ## p ≤ 0.01; #### p ≤ 0.0001 vs. respective Ala group; Mann Whitney
  test.'
