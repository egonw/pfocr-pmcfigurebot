caption: SnRK1 pathway activation in response to sucrose starvation in WT and spl7-1
  mutant seedlings. A, Photographs of 15-day-old seedlings cultivated in liquid medium
  under low-Cu (no CuSO4 added) or control (1 µM CuSO4) conditions with 0.5% (w/v)
  sucrose following a 3-h sucrose starvation treatment (no sucrose). Scale bar = 1 cm.
  B and C, Relative transcript levels for the SnRK1 pathway marker genes DIN6 (induced
  by SnRK1 activity) and EXP10 (repressed by SnRK1 activity) in the shoots of seedlings
  cultivated as described for (A), as quantified by RT–qPCR. Data are means ± sd (n = 3
  technical replicates, that is independent PCR runs, each with three replicate wells
  per transcript). Transcript levels were normalized to those of EIF4 as a constitutively
  expressed control gene. Different lowercase letters denote significant differences
  (P < 0.05) between means based on t tests with FDR adjustment (q-value < 0.05) (B)
  or ANOVA (Tukey’s HSD) (C).
