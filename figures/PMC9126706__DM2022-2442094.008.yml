caption: 'PCAT19 regulated LC cell growth and apoptosis by inhibiting the MAPK signaling
  pathway. (a, b) The viability of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells treated with Honokiol (10 μM)
  of the ERK agonist and anisomycin (0.1 μM) of the p38 and JNK agonist was detected
  by the MTT assay. (c, d) Colony formation assay was performed to observe the growth
  of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells treated with Honokiol (10 μM) of the ERK agonist and
  anisomycin (0.1 μM) of the p38 and JNK agonist. (e, f) Apoptosis of A549 and SK-MES-1
  cells treated with Honokiol (10 μM) of the ERK agonist and anisomycin (0.1 μM) of
  the p38 and JNK agonist was detected by flow cytometry. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  vs. NC; ^P < 0.05, ^^P < 0.01, and ^^^P < 0.001 vs. Hon; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001
  vs. Ani. Abbreviations: ERK: extracellular regulated protein kinases; JNK: c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; qRT-PCR: quantitative
  real-time polymerase chain reaction.'
