caption: 'The protective role of KHK deletion against the development of sugar-induced
  metabolic syndrome. (A) Hepatocytes with functional KHK can metabolize fructose
  through fructolysis and this can contribute to liver steatosis and adiposity. (B)
  KHK deficiency in hepatocytes inhibits fructolysis and serves a protective role
  against liver steatosis and adiposity. Enzymes are shown in bold red, metabolites
  are black, pathway outcomes are italicized navy. Upwards and downwards blue arrows
  are indicative of activity being upregulated or downregulated, respectively. Proteins:
  GLUT, Glucose transporter; KHK, Ketohexokinase; ALDOB, Aldolase B; Metabolites:
  F1P, Fructose-1-phosphate; GA, Glyceraldehyde; DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  Pyr, Pyruvate; Ac-CoA, Acetyl-CoA; Citrate; Pathway: TCA cycle, Tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.'
