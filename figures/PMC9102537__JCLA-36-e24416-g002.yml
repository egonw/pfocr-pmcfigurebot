caption: Loss of IMPDH1 regulates molecular pathways. (A) Significantly altered KEGG
  pathways in IMPDH1KD cells; (B) A subnetwork composing of 205 nodes and 1568 edges
  was generated using differently expressed genes in IMPDH1KD cells. Pathway enrichment
  analysis shows that the subnetwork is mainly enriched in cancer‐related pathways
  (Red ball represents pathways in cancer, yellow ball represents hepatocellular carcinoma,
  pink ball represents PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, purple ball represents cell cycle,
  dark green ball represents hippo signaling pathway, green ball represents hepatitis
  B, blue ball represents gastric cancer, and brown ball represents p53 signaling
  pathways). (C) q‐PCR shows that the expression levels of E2F family genes were changed
  in IMPDH1KD cells
