caption: Niloticin is a potential drug as an MD-2 antagonist. Niloticin may exhibit
  anti-inflammatory activity by interacting with MD-2 with higher affinity than LPS
  and suppressing the activation of the LPS-TLR4/MD-2-NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.
article_title: Niloticin binds to MD-2 to promote anti-inflammatory pathway activation
  in macrophage cells.
