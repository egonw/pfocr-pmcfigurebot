caption: Proposed working model of CRC‐EV‐mediated NOD1 activation in promoting liver
  metastasis of CRC. EVs derived from CRC cells carry a high cargo of CDC42. When
  CRC‐EVs are transported into macrophages, CDC42 is delivered from CRC‐EVs to cells
  and switched to a GTP‐bound active state, which mediates NOD1 activation, with consequent
  RIP2 phosphorylation; it triggers downstream NF‐κB and p38‐MAPK‐dependent inflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine (i.e., IL‐6, CCL1 and CCL2) release, which promotes CRC metastasis
article_title: Extracellular vesicles from colorectal cancer cells promote metastasis
  via the NOD1 signalling pathway.
