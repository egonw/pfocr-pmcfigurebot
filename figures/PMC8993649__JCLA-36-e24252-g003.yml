caption: (A) Image illustrates the clustergram of the KEGG pathway for differentially
  expressed genes. The clustergram shows the role of the talin‐1 (TLN1) gene in platelet
  activation and focal adhesion pathways. B) The Genotype‐Tissue Expression (GTEx)
  portal demonstrates that TLN1 has the highest expression in arteries. (C & D) The
  Human miRNA Tissue ATLAS database shows that miR‐9‐5p has the highest expression
  in the brain, whereas miR‐182‐5p has the highest expression in vessels
article_title: Downregulation of Talin‐1 is associated with the increased expression
  of miR‐182‐5p and miR‐9‐5p in coronary artery disease.
