caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of eugenol synthesis in carnation. (a) Three
  volatiles were identified by SPME of GC_MS. (b) The content of eugenol at different
  stages of floral development. (c) Proposed biosynthetic pathway of eugenol synthesis
  in carnation. Phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase (PAL), cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase (C4H),
  chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3‐hydroxylase (F3H),
  dihydroflavonol 4‐reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), UDP‐flavonoid glucosyltransferase
  (UFGT), caffeoyl‐CoA O‐methyl transferase (CCOMT), cinnamoyl‐CoA reductase (CCR),
  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), coniferyl alcohol acetatyltransferase (CFAT),
  eugenol synthase (EGS).
