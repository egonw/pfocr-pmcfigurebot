caption: Effects of the isolated compounds on the NF-κB (p65) pathway in BV2 cells
  (A–D). Cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of compounds 1 and 2
  for 3 h and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/mL) for 1 h. Representative
  blots from three independent experiments are shown. Immunoblots were quantified
  using ImageJ software. p-IκBα intensities were normalized to β-actin. P65 intensities
  were normalized to PCNA. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with LPS-treated
  group.
