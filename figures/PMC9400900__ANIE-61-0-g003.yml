caption: Production of higher alcohols from syngas via the integration of Fischer–Tropsch
  synthesis (FTS) and reductive hydroformylation (RHF) in a tandem process. The active
  sites of the solid catalyst are responsible for chain growth (number of Cn  in R).
  The ratio between β‐H elimination and hydrogenation as chain termination steps determines
  the primary hydrocarbon selectivity, i.e. olefin‐to‐paraffin ratio. The activity
  of the molecular catalyst in olefin reductive hydroformylation relative to secondary
  olefin hydrogenation pathways determines the final alcohol selectivity. For completeness,
  the CO insertion chain‐termination pathway on the FTS catalyst is also indicated
  as a source for primary, strictly linear higher alcohols.
