caption: Involvement of the jasmonic acid pathway during F. oxysporum infection in
  gi-100 plants. (A, B) Transcript expression validation using RT-qPCR and (C, D)
  quantitative profiling of jasmonic acid and jasmonyl-(L)-isoleucine amount at 24
  DPI by F. oxysporum were done in gi-100 and Col-0 leaf samples. (A, B) Relative
  transcript levels of (A) CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) and (B) PLANT DEFENSIN1.2
  (PDF1.2). ACTIN was used to normalize transcript levels. Determination of (C) jasmonic
  acid hormone and (D) jasmonyl-(L)-isoleucine JA-ile amounts. For JA and JA-ile quantification,
  D6-jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid-[13C6] isoleucine conjugate were taken as standard.
  The qRT-PCR reactions were done in triplicate from three biological replicates.Values
  are expressed as mean ± SD. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test was performed with the help of GraphPad Prism to test for significance
  among the dataset, ***p < 0.001. ns, Non-significant.
