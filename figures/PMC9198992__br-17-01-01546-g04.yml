caption: 'Effect of RAPA on NF-kB signaling pathway activity in LPS-treated RAW 264.7
  cells. Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of RAPA for 1 h and
  subsequently stimulated with 1 µg/ml LPS for 30 min. Phosphorylation of NF-κB and
  IκB were measured by western blot analysis (A)and analyzed using ImageJ software
  (B) and (C). Translocation of NF-κB was determined by immunofluorescence analysis
  (C). Scale bar, 40 µm. NF-κB was stained green, the nucleus was stained with DAPI
  (blue). Each bar represents the mean ± SD. #P<0.05 vs. untreated cells; *P<0.05
  vs. LPS treated cells. RAPA, red ginseng marc, Artemisia scoparia Waldst.et Kit,
  Paeonia japonica Miyabe & Takeda, and Angelica gigas Nakai extract mixture.'

  japonica and Angelica gigas extract mixture in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
