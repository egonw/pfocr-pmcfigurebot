caption: SPTLC2 can affect the proliferation, migration, adhesion, angiogenesis, and
  S1P production of HUVECs. After HUVECs were transfected with siR-NC (SPTLC2 small
  interfering RNA negative control), siR-SPTLC2 (SPTLC2 small interfering RNA), SPTLC2-NC
  (SPTLC2 plasmid negative control), or SPTLC2 (SPTLC2 plasmid), the protein expression
  of SPTLC2 was detected by western blotting assay (a), and the proliferation (b),
  migration (c), adhesion (d), angiogenesis (e), and S1P production (f) were measured.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the blank group.
