caption: Tumor growth in nude mice. (A) Each group comprised 10 nude mice and the
  average tumor volume was calculated. Compared with PANC-1 group, the average tumor
  volume of KRASWT group decreased and that of KRASG12D group increased (**P<0.01).
  (B) Images of tumors in nude mice. (C) Changes in body weight of nude mice. KRAS,
  Kirsten rat sarcoma virus; WT, wild-type.
article_title: Wild-type KRAS inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
  through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
