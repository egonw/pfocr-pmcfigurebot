caption: Gene and protein expression date. A. Graph showing the relative values of
  the differential expression in the seven samples of the HNC; B. Graph showing the
  relative values of the differential expression comparing the CD44/CD117/CD133 and
  ALDH cell sorting criteria; C. Graph showing the relative values of the differential
  expression comparing the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx primary subtypes; D. Histogram
  showing of the proteins expression as fold change in protein expression normalized
  to β-actin expression; E. Subjected to western blot analysis of β-actin, EGFR, TRKB,
  KRAS and HIF-1α expression. *P<0.01 compared to CD44/CD117/CD133 cell sorted criteria;
  a = P<0.01 compared to KRAS gene expression of the ALDH cell sorting criteria by
  two-way ANOVA statistical analysis.
