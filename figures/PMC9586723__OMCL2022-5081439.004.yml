caption: Identification of exosomes derived from pericyte. (a) Transmission electron
  microscopy (TEM) results showed that the negatively stained exosomes were in the
  shape of saucers with a diameter of about 100 nm. (b) The particle sizes of exosomes
  derived from pericytes were at about 100 nm according to nanoparticle size analysis.
  (c) Immunoblot results showed that exosomes derived from pericytes specifically
  expressed CD63 and TSG101, while the culture medium did not express such molecules
  after exosome extraction. (d) Red fluorescent was observed under a fluorescence
  microscope in U251 cells cocultured with PKH26 labeled exosomes. (e) Immunoblot
  results showed that when exosomes loaded with si-PDGFRβ were extracted, the protein
  level of PDGFRβ in cells decreased significantly (∗P < 0.05 vs. PBS or Unloaded-Exo
  group).
