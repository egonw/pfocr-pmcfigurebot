caption: (A) Symptoms of Coniella diplodiella infection on the leaf samples of Vitis
  vinifera Manicure Finger (Vv) and Vitis davidii accession 0940 (Vd). Two-week-old
  leaf samples were collected at the 3-4 position. Typical hypersensitive response
  (HR) symptoms were observed in Vd but not in Vv at 72 h post-infection (hpi). There
  were four replications of each species. (B) Endogenous measurement of SA from the
  V. davidii and V. vinifera after 0, 12, 48, and 72 h of white rot disease (Coniella
  diplodiella) inoculation.
