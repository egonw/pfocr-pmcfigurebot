caption: 'EVs from CRC plasma mediate NOD1 activation in human PBMCs. (a and b) Relative
  levels of p‐RIP2 and p‐p38 in PBMCs from healthy donors or patients with CRC‐LM
  detected using (a) western blotting and analysed by (b) Image J densitometric software;
  (n = 3). (c and d) Relative levels of p‐RIP2, p‐p65 and p‐p38 in PBMCs from healthy
  donors stimulated with EV‐HD (n = 7) or EV‐CRC‐LM (n = 7) detected using (c) western
  blotting and analysed by (d) Image J densitometric software. (e and f) Relative
  p‐RIP2, p‐p65 and p‐p38 abundance in PBMCs from healthy donors pre‐treated with
  ML130 (20 μM) and incubated with EV‐HD (n = 7) or EV‐CRC‐LM (n = 7) detected using
  (e) western blotting and analysed by (f) Image J densitometric software. (g) CDC42
  and flotillin 1 expression in EV‐HD (n = 7) and EV‐CRC‐LM (n = 7). (h)The relative
  CDC42 protein expression in EV from HD and CRC‐LM assessed using Image J densitometric
  analysis and normalised based on the average of the HD densitometric values (n = 7).
  EV‐HD: EVs from healthy donors; EV‐CRC‐LM: EVs from patients with CRC‐LM. Mann–Whitney
  test was used to determine the significance level; mean; error bar, S.E.M. *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001'
