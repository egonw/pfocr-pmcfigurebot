caption: Proteins involved in flagellar synthesis in E. coli. Distribution of flagellar
  proteins (excluding chemotaxis proteins). Proteins transcribed by the master operon
  flhDC, class I genes, are shown in blue. Proteins involved in the basal body and
  flagellar hook, transcribed by class II genes, are shown in green. Proteins responsible
  for the flagellar filament and chemotactic signaling system, transcribed by class
  III genes, are shown in light brown. Figure adapted from the KEGG pathway database
