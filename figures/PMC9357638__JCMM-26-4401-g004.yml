caption: Effect of ANKRD49 overexpression and knockdown in A549 cells on cell migration
  and invasion. (A) Effect of ANKRD49 overexpression on A549 cell migration determined
  by scratch healing analysis after 24 h and 48 h; (B) Width of scratch wound after
  24 h and 48 h. (C) Effect of ANKRD49 knockdown on A549 cell migration determined
  by scratch healing analysis after 48 h. (D) Width of scratch wound after 24 h and
  48 h. (E) Matrigel invasion and migration assay of A549 cells following overexpression
  of ANKRD49 (ANKRD49 OE), compared to control cells (vector) in a 200× light by crystal
  violet staining. (F) Matrigel invasion analysis of ANKRD49 OE A549 cells or its
  vector control cells under a light scope in three randomly selected areas. (G) Transwell
  migration analysis of ANKRD49 OE A549 cells or its vector counterpart cells under
  a light scope in three randomly selected areas. (H) Matrigel invasion and migration
  assay of A549 cells after ANKRD49 knockdowns (ANKRD49 KD702 and ANKRD49 KD829),
  compared to their shcontrol cells by crystal violet staining. (I). Matrigel invasion
  analysis of A549 cells stably transfected with shcontrol, ANKRD49 KD702, or ANKRD49
  KD829 under a light scope in three randomly selected areas. (J) Transwell migration
  analysis of A549 cells stably transfected with shcontrol, ANKRD49 KD702, or ANKRD49
  KD829 vectors under a light scope in three randomly selected areas. Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ns, no significance
