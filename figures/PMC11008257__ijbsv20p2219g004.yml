caption: Interference with NUP85 mitigated lipid accumulation, inflammation and apoptosis
  in FFA-induced AML-12 cells. A-B and E. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to
  detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of SREBP-1C, PPAR-α and ACOX-1 in
  AML-12 cells transfected with NUP85-siRNA and pcDNA3.1-3×Flag-c-NUP85. C-D and F.
  After transfected with NUP85-siRNA and pcDNA3.1-3×Flag-c-NUP85, Western blotting
  and RT-qPCR were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of IL-6,
  IL-1β and TNF-α. G-H Secretion levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in culture medium.
  All experimental results of this study were replicated at least three times. * *p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001 compared with the pair group.
