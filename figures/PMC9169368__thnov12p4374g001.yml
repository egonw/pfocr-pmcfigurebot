caption: Schematic representation of the canonical and noncanonical NOTCH signaling
  pathways. A. The canonical Notch signaling pathway is activated by ligand-receptor
  interactions leading to NICD release and translocation to the nucleus to form a
  transcriptional activation complex after binding to MAML-1 and CSL. Noncanonical
  NOTCH signaling regulates target gene expression via mechanisms that do not implicate
  HES factors. B. Structure of HES factors with conserved domains.
