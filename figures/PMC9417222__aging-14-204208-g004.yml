caption: IL-17D induces lung cancer cells to express a series of TAM recruitment–
  and polarization–related genes. (A–C) The relative mRNA levels of genes related
  to macrophages recruitment and polarization was measured via quantitative real-time
  PCR. RNA was purified from A549 cells expressing IL-17D or empty vector (A), LLC1
  cells expressing IL-17D or empty vector (B), and H1155 cells with knockdown of IL-17D
  or control (C). Mean ± SD. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. (D) Representative images and
  quantification of recruited macrophages. Mean ± SD. ***P < 0.001. Scale bars, 100
  μm.
