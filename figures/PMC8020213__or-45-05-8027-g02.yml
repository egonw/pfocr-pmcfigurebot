caption: 'CASC15 can activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to regulate the
  cell cycle and interfere with the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells. (A and B)
  U-2OS cells were transfected with oe-CASC15, sh-CASC15, and their respective negative
  controls (oe-NC and sh-NC), and RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to detect
  the expression of Wnt, β-catenin, and cyclin D, respectively. (C and D) U-2OS cells
  were transfected with oe-CASC15, oe-CASC15 + Wnt inhibitor, and control, and RT-qPCR
  and western blotting were used to detect the expression of Wnt, β-catenin, and cyclin
  D, respectively. (E and F) The cell cycle was detected in U-2OS cells which were
  transfected with oe-CASC15, oe-CASC15 + Wnt inhibitor, and control. (G) A Cell Counting
  Kit-8 assay was performed in U-2OS cells which were transfected with oe-CASC15,
  oe-CASC15 + Wnt inhibitor, and control. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. oe-NC,
  control or oe-CASC15; #P<0.05 and ###P<0.001 vs. sh-NC or control. CASC15, cancer
  susceptibility 15; oe, overexpressed; NC, negative control; sh, short hairpin; ns,
  nonstatistically significant difference.'
