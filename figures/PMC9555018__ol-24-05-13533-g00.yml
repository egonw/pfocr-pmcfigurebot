caption: EDN1 expression, which is upregulated by ID1, is elevated in the vascular-related
  region in tissues derived from patients with GBM. (A) Venn diagram obtained after
  merging two datasets to identify vascular regulating factors associated with ID1
  (Module 92 refers to a list containing 149 secreted signaling molecules in humans,
  n=149, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/cards/module_92; ID1 Up-DEG, n=433,
  >2 fold, <FDR value 0.05). (B) mRNA expression levels of EDN1 in tissues of patients
  with GBM were determined using the Ivy GAP database. (C) Identification of mRNA
  expression of candidate genes (NMU, WISP, EDN1 and ID1) using the Ivy GAP database
  (http://glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org/). The relative mRNA levels were converted
  to z-score and are presented using a heat-map. EDN1, endothelin1; FDR, false discovery
  rate; FPKM, fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments; GBM, glioblastoma;
  ID1, inhibitor of differentiation 1; ID1 Up-DEG, ID1 Upregulated-Differentially
  Expressed Genes; Ivy GAP, Ivy glioblastoma atlas project; NMU, neuromedin u; WISP2,
  wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2.
