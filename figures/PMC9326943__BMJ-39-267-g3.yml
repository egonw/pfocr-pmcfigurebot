caption: FLOT2 increased CC cell metastasis and EMT. (a) Transwell assay was used
  to measure the migration of CC cells. Cell migration was strengthened after overexpressing
  FLOT2 and weakened after silencing FLOT2. (b) Levels of EMT-related proteins were
  measured by Western blot analysis. EMT progress was facilitated after overexpressing
  FLOT2 and retarded after silencing FLOT2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001
  compared with the NC group. ^P < 0.05, ^^P < 0.01, and ^^^P <0.001 compared with
  the siNC group.
