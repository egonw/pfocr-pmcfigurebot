caption: 'CA displays inhibitory roles in cellular death via suppressing the mitochondrial-dependent
  apoptotic pathway. Oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades induce activities
  increase of p53 and NF-κB, both of which contribute to level elevation of Bax. While
  PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 signaling axis induce content increase of Bcl-2 and level reduction
  of Bax on the membrane, which weaken Cyt C release into the cytosol and then disrupt
  the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase; Akt: protein kinase B; NOX: NADPH oxidase; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
  factor 2; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; CAT: catalase; GPX1: glutathione peroxidase 1;
  TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK1/2: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2; NQO1: NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor of κB; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; NO: nitric oxide; Bcl-2:
  B-cell lymphoma 2; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; Cyt C: cytochrome C; Apaf-1:
  apoptosis protease activating factor-1.'
