caption: 'Ferroptosisâ€”classification, characteristics, induction. (A) Ferroptosis
  is classified as a form of regulated cell death characterized by severe, uncontrolled
  lipid peroxidation and loss of cell membrane integrity. (B) The prerequisites for
  induction of ferroptosis include the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  fueled by an increase of intracellular iron (Fe), which cause oxidation of membrane
  lipids. The changes are enabled (facilitated) by a reduced activity of cellular
  antioxidant defense mechanisms. (C) Ferroptosis induction is further classified
  into an extrinsic or intrinsic pathway. Abbreviations: ACD = accidental cell death,
  BH4 = tetrahydrobiopterin, CoQ10 = coenzyme Q10, Cys2 = cystine, DHFR = dihydrofolate
  reductase, FA = fatty acid, FSP1 = ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, GCH1 = GTP
  cyclohydrolase 1, GPX4 = glutathione peroxidase 4, GSH = glutathione (reduced),
  PL-PUFA = PUFA-containing phospholipid, PL-PUFA-OOH = phospholipid hydroperoxide,
  PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid, RCD = regulated cell death, ROS = reactive oxygen
  species. Based on: [,,,].'
