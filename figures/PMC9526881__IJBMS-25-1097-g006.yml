caption: si-CCR8 alleviates Ang II-induced ROS generation and inflammation in VSMCs
  through MAPK/NF κB signaling pathway. (A) The ROS generation in the untreated, control,
  si-RNA and si-LRRK2 group. (B) The IL-6 level in the untreated, control, si-RNA
  and si-LRRK2 group. (C) The TNF-α level in the untreated, control, si-RNA and si-LRRK2
  group. (D) The protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS in the untreated, control, si-RNA
  and si-LRRK2 group. “*” means compared with the untreated group at P<0.05, and “#”
  means compared with the si-CCR8 group at P<0.05. GAPDH was used as an invariant
  internal control for calculating protein fold-changes
