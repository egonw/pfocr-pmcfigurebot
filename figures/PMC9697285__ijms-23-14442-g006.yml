caption: 'Upregulation of genes of the Wnt signaling pathway in Runx1 knockout ovaries.
  (A) Examples of significantly differentially expressed genes in Runx1 KO vs. control
  ovaries at 4.5 months. Boxplots represent the DESeq2-normalized counts from RNA-seq
  data. Values are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 6/genotype); * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001. (B) RNA-scope for the Rspo1 probe in control and Runx1 KO ovaries
  at 4.5 months (n = 4/genotype). Arrowheads point to Rspo1+ follicle-like lesions.
  Arrows point to follicle-like lesions with little to no Rspo1 expression. Scale
  bars: 100 μm.'
