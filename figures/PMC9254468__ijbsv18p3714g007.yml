caption: ISP-I possessed a favorable tumor-suppressive effect as well as a good safety
  profile in vivo. (A) Xenograft tumors in vehicle-treated group and ISP-I-treated
  groups (30mg/kg, 60mg/kg) after 18 days' treatment. Tumor volumes were calculated
  every 3 days to plot tumor growth curve. (B) Tumors weight in vehicle-treated group
  and ISP-I-treated groups (30mg/kg, 60mg/kg) at the end of experiments. (C) Body
  weight curve in nude mice. (D) The HE staining images of major organs in mice after
  vehicle- and ISP-I-treatment (30mg/kg, 60mg/kg). (E) Liver and kidney function indicators
  between blank control group and ISP-I-treated groups. n=5, *** p < 0.001.
