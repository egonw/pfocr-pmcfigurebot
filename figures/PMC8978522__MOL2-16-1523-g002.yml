caption: Working model showing the regulation of SMAR1 upon LPS treatment. TLR4 upon
  recognizing LPS initiates the signaling cascade. This leads to the activation of
  transcription factor IRF3 via TLR4‐TRIF‐dependent pathway. IRF3 upon phosphorylation
  translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of various type I
  interferons including IFN‐β. It could also induce the expression of zinc finger
  protein TOPORS, which further controls the transcription of tumor suppressor SMAR1
  via binding to the consensus region present on its promoter. LPS‐induced SMAR1 in
  return represses the transcription of STAT3 and hence shifts the TAMs toward antitumor
  M1 profile, whereas upon inhibiting TLR4 pathway using a chemical inhibitor (TAK‐242),
  the downstream adapter proteins fail to bind to the TIR domain of TLR4. Under such
  circumstances, even LPS stimulation fails to enhance the expression of TOPORS and
  SMAR1. In the absence of effective SMAR1 concentration, the repression on STAT3
  promoter is released. In excess STAT3 conditions, most of the TAMs tend to polarize
  to M2 phenotype, which is associated with cancer growth and progression.
