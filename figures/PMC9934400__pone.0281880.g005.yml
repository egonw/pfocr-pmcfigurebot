  metabolism from each group using the IPA tool
caption: Canonical pathways sorted by z score within the top 50 canonical pathways
  from the (A) IP route (MLN vs. spleen), (B) MLN (IP route vs. oral route), and (C)
  spleen (IP route vs. oral route). Genes that were not significant (p value â‰¥ 0.05
  or Log2FC < 1.0) are shown as N/A.
