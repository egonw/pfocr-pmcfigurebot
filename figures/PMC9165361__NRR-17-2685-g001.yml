caption: 'A diagram of 14-3-3ζ-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway.This
  diagram shows the steps leading to RGS14414-mediated increase in BDNF. 14-3-3ζ binds
  to receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) and help to shuttle from cytoplasm
  to nucleus, where 14-3-3ζ-RACK1 complex interacts with exon IV of BDNF and promotes
  its transcription. Increase in BDNF induces neuronal structural plasticity, which
  in turn, facilitates memory enhancement and causes rescue from memory deficits.
  RGS14: regulator of G protein signaling 14.'

  and the rescue from memory deficits.
