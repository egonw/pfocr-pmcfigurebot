caption: N6-methyladenosine and cell apoptosis associated signaling pathway. N6-methyladenosine
  can get involved in three key apoptosis associated signaling pathways as follows-.
  a In the mitochondrial pathway, m6A modification can affect cell apoptosis by regulating
  the fate of Bcl-2 and BMF. b In endoplasmic reticulum pathway, m6A modification
  can affect cell apoptosis by regulating SEC62. c In death receptor pathway, m6A
  modification can influences cell apoptosis by regulating TNFRSF2
