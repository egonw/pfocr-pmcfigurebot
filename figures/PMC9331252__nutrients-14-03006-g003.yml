caption: 'nCGA altered the migration-related proteins in OH cultured VSMCs. Cells
  were co-treated with OH, MLE, and nCGA (40 or 120 μM) for 24 h and then subjected
  to immunodetection conducted with antibodies against by Western blot analyses. (A)
  Densitometry was used to quantify p-FAK relative to total FAK, p-Src relative to
  total Src, and Integrin β3 relative to β-actin. (B) The gelatin zymography was then
  performed to analyze the activities of MMP-9 and MMP-2 as described in the Materials
  and Methods. (C) Densitometry was used to quantify NF-κB, p-IκB relative to total
  IκB, Rac1, Rho A, and Cdc42 relative to β-actin. The quantitative data are presented
  as the mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent experiments. # p < 0.05 as
  compared to the C (control). * p < 0.05 as compared to the OH group.'
