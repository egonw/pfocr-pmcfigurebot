caption: (A) Critical basic steps in the pathway of HO-1 regulation via its upstream
  transcription factor Nrf2 upon activation in response to extracellular signaling
  followed by translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm. (B) Diagram illustrating the
  involvement of HO-1 in iron homeostasis in normal cellular function, depicting HO-1-dependent
  hemoglobin and heme catabolic pathway. The activated HO-1 degrades hemoglobin and
  heme to biliverdin which is rapidly catalyzed by biliverdin reductase to bilirubinâ€”a
  potent physiological mediator of the natural anti-inflammatory process.
