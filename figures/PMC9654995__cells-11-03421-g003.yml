caption: 'The amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. (A) The
  non-amyloidogenic pathway is starting by α-secretase cleavage of APP which leads
  to the release of soluble APPα (sAPPα) and concomitant generation of the α-C-terminal
  fragment (α-CTF). Subsequent cleavage of the α-CTF by γ-secretase leads to the secretion
  of the small fragment p3 and release of the APP intracellular C-terminal domain
  (AICD) into the cytosol. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by β-secretase
  to produce soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) and the membrane retained β-C-terminal fragment
  (β-CTF). Further processing of the β-CTF by γ-secretase releases AICD as well as
  the Aβ peptide, which can form neurotoxic oligomers. Aβ production was reported
  to be higher in neuronal cultures compared to astrocytes or microglia cultures [,].
  3D structures (PDB: 1IYT) are based on NMR experiments by Crescenzi and colleagues
  []. (B) Glial cells mainly produce N-abridged Aβ peptides (up to 60%) such as Aβ2/3-X
  or Aβ4/5-x, while neurons produce predominantly Aβ peptides starting at position
  1 (80%) [].'
