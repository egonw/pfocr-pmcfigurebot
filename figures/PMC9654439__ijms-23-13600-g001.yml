caption: Structure, function and biosynthetic pathway of tRNA t6A. (A). The crystal
  structure of t6A-ASL of E coli. tRNALys (UUU) paired with mRNA in ribosomes (omitted
  for clarity) []. (B). Chemical structures of t6A and t6A derivatives with modifications
  highlighted in red. t6A, N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine; ct6A, cyclic N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine;
  ms2t6A, 2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine; ms2ct6A, 2-methylthiocyclic
  N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine; m6t6A, N6-methyl-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine; ht6A,
  hydroxy-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine. (C). Enzymatically validated and representative
  tRNA t6A-modifying enzymes in the three domains of life and the enzymatic pathway
  of tRNA t6A biosynthesis. The catalytic members of TsaC/Sua5 and TsaD/Kae1/Qri7
  families are colored in brown and red, respectively. Evolutionarily related proteins
  are color-coded. (D). Crystal structures of E. coli TsaC [], P. abyssi Sua5 [] and
  S. tokudaii Sua5 [,]. The YrdC domain and Sua5 domain are displayed in brown and
  light yellow, respectively, and the connecting loop between the two domains is marked
  in blue. The bound ligand (L-threonine, HCO3− and PPi in P. abyssi Sua5, AMPPNP,
  L-threonine, TC-AMP and Mg2+ in S. tokodaii Sua5) are shown in detail and the KxR···SxN
  tetrad motifs are indicated. (E). Crystal structures of TsaD/Kae1/Qri7 proteins
  from different species (E. coli [,], S. typhimurium [], T. maritima [], M. jannaschii
  [], P. abyssi [], T. acidophilum [], H. sapiens [] and S. cerevisiae []). The metal-binding
  motif (HxxH···D) and nucleotide-binding site are indicated in each structure. KG4,
  carboxyadenosine. (F,G). Crystal structure, domain organization and enzymatic catalysis
  of S. tenebrarius TobZ [] (F) and E. coli HypF []. (G). TobZ comprises an N-terminal
  Kae1 domain (red) and a C-terminal YrdC domain (brown); HypF comprises an N-terminal
  ACP domain (greenish), a ZF domain (cyan), a YrdC domain (brown) and a C-terminal
  Kae1 domain (red). The chemical transformation in the reactions catalyzed by the
  YrdC and Kae1 domains is shown in TobZ (F,G). The reaction channels between the
  two domains are marked in light green. CP, carbamoyl phosphate; CA, carbamoyladenylate.
  PDB codes are given in brackets.
