caption: SNHG22 modulates PCDH11X-activated PI3K/Akt signaling to drive trophoblast
  migration and invasion. (A) GSEA and Western blotting analyzed the correlation of
  PCDH11X with PI3K/Akt signaling. HTR-8/Svneo and JEG-3 were transfected with si-NC,
  si-PCDH11X with or without miR-128-3p inhibitor. Wound healing (B and C) and Transwell
  assays (D and E) assessed the migration and invasion of HTR-8/Svneo cells. Experiments
  were replicated three times. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD.

  axis and activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
