caption: FOXM1 regulated HO-ADSC-exosome-mediated EOC progression by targeting Cyclin
  F and KIF20A. (A–D). FOXM1, Cyclin F, and KIF20A mRNA expression in A2780, HO8910,
  SKOV3, and HEY cells was determined by qRT–PCR. (E–H). FOXM1, Cyclin F, and KIF20A
  protein expression in A2780, HO8910, SKOV3, and HEY cells were measured using Western
  blot assays after FOXM1 knockdown. (I–L). Densitometric quantification of FOXM1,
  Cyclin F, and KIF20A expression in A2780, HO8910, SKOV3, and HEY cells after FOXM1
  knockdown. (M). KEGG pathway enrichment based on the differentially expressed genes
  after HO-ADSC exosome treatment. (N). Western blotting was performed to evaluate
  MAPK signaling pathways. * p < 0.05, n = 3.
