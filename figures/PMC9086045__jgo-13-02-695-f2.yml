caption: miRNA-320 inhibits the survival and proliferation of IECs in mice. (A) Representative
  images of colonic tumor tissues of H&E stained (×100, ×200). (B) Hyperplasia score.
  (C,D) Expression of Ki-67 protein in colon tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
  (E-G) Expression of BCL-xl and PCNA proteins in colon tissue was analyzed by Western
  blot. The same column was GAPDH as an internal control. (H) miRNA-320 expression
  in the intestine detected by qPCR in mice. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
