caption: (a) GSEA comparison of upregulated and downregulated genes in the PI3K/Akt-MT
  and PI3K/Akt-WT groups. The enrichment score greater than 0 indicates that the pathway
  is upregulated in the PI3K/Akt-MT group, and the enrichment score less than 0 indicates
  that the pathway is downregulated in the PI3K/Akt-MT group. The color of the pathway
  name is consistent with the color of the broken line in the figure; P value less
  than 0.05 is statistically significant. (b) The potential mechanism of PI3K/Akt-MT
  patients with colorectal cancer receiving ICI had a better prognosis.

  an Immune-Related Prognostic Biomarker in Colon Adenocarcinoma Patients Receiving
  Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment.
