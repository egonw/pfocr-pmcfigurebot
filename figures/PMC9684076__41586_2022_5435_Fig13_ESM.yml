figure_title: F. nucleatum induces the formation of cell clusters in immune and cancer
  cells
caption: 'a, Confocal images showing cluster formation of differentiated neutrophils
  derived from human HL-60 cells (green) co-cultured with F. nucleatum (pink) at different
  multiplicity of infection (MOI). Top micrographs display the raw imaging data. Bottom
  micrographs display the corresponding mask surfaces for each experimental condition
  by using Imaris software. Colour bar indicates the size (volume µm3) of the objects.
  b, Left: Violin plot indicates the quantification of volume of individual neutrophil
  clusters (data points) in the present of F. nucleatum as shown in (a); combined
  data from 4 independent experiments. Right: Dot plot shows the number of neutrophil
  clusters (objects) per field of view as indicated in (a). Data points represent
  the number of cell objects for each independent experiment (n = 4). p-values were
  calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test. c,
  Flow cytometry plots show the levels of phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK in neutrophils
  treated with F. nucleatum. Corresponding dot plots indicate the level of phosphorylation
  for each independent experiment (data points; n = 4). d, Spheroids derived from
  a mouse CRC cell line CT26WT were treated with or without F. nucleatum for 12 h
  and then embedded in collage matrices. The cell invasion capabilities for both conditions
  were evaluated using live-cell confocal imaging over a period of 19 h. Amplified
  images show the difference in the migration mode from both conditions. e, Log10
  fold change volume over time of uninfected CRC spheroids revealing the expansion
  rate of uninfected control spheroids. Data points indicate the average values from
  three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the standard deviation (SD).
  f, Number of F. nucleatum-positive cancer cells that detached from the spheroid
  mass as single motile cells from three independent experiments. Errors bars indicate
  the SD. g-h, Distribution of the average speed and cell displacements of single
  cells that escape the spheroid mass infected with F. nucleatum. Combined data from
  three independent experiments. Red bars indicate the mean. Data points represents
  individual tracks; “n” indicates number of tracks per condition. i, Cell trajectories
  from an origin point of invading cancer cells that escape the spheroids infected
  with F. nucleatum. j, Signalling pathway analysis of CRC spheroids infected with
  F. nucleatum in comparison to uninfected control spheroids. k, Volcano plots showing
  the regulation of genes in selected signalling pathways in spheroids infected with
  F. nucleatum in comparison to uninfected spheroids. Dashed lines indicate the threshold
  of significant gene expression defined as the Log2 fold change ≤−0.58 and ≥0.58
  with a -Log10 p value ≥1.301 following LMM analysis and Benjamini–Hochberg multiple-correction
  testing. l, Confocal images showing cell cluster formation of cancer cells derived
  from the human cell line HCT116 treated with F. nucleatum at different MOI as it
  is indicated. m, Left: Violin plot indicates the quantification of volume of individual
  cancer cell clusters (data points) in the present of F. nucleatum as shown in (l);
  combined data from 4 independent experiments. Right: Dot plot shows the number of
  cancer cell objects per field of view as indicated in (l). Data points represent
  the number of clusters for each independent experiment (n = 4). p-values were calculated
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test. n, Flow cytometry
  plots show the levels of phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK in cancer cells treated
  with F. nucleatum. Corresponding dot plots indicate the level of phosphorylation
  for each independent experiment (data points; n = 4).'
