figure_title: DT-061-mediated ATF4-CHOP activation is regulated independently of PERK
  activity and eIF2α phosphorylation
caption: 'A) Western blotting analysis evaluating the effect of DT-061 treatment on
  eIF2α phosphorylation as well as ATF4 and CHOP expression in multiple HGSC and FT
  lines to identify dependency profiles. OV81, PEO-1, PEO-C4.2, and CAOV3 represent
  HGSC models (shades of orange) while FT246 and FT237 represent non-malignant fallopian
  tube tissues (shades of green). B) Schematic representing the two well-established
  canonical pathways that phosphorylate eIF2α resulting in ATF4 and CHOP increased
  expression: PERK (via the UPR) and PKR, GCN2, and HR (as part of the Integrated
  Stress Response (ISR)). Chemical inhibitors utilized to test PERK and eIF2α contribution
  to DT-061-mediated ATF4 and CHOP activation are also represented. C) Western blot
  analysis assessing the role of PERK activation and subsequent UPR regulation in
  OV81 and FT246 cells in the presence of DT-061. Cells were pre-incubated with either
  DMSO or 1μM of PERK inhibitor (PERKi) for 3 hours. Subsequently, DT-061 (DMSO pre-incubated),
  fresh PERKi, or the combination of the two drugs (PERKi pre-incubated) were added
  and cells were harvested after 3, 6, and 24 hours of the second round of drug exposure.
  PERK pathway activity was measured by assessing its hyperphosphorylation state (band
  shift) and downstream targets’ expression. D) Western blot analysis assessing the
  role of p-eIF2α downstream signaling and its impact in the activation of ATF4 and
  CHOP proteins in OV81 cells after treatment with DT-061. Cells were pre-incubated
  with either DMSO or 1μM of ISR Inhibitor (ISRIB) for 3 hours. Cells were then treated
  with either Tg or DT-061 after both DMSO and ISRIB pre-incubation and harvested
  at 6 hours post-second treatment round (total of 9 hours). Expression of ATF4 and
  its downstream targets were evaluated under each of these treatment conditions and
  quantified (in Suppl. Fig. 2K). E) A pool of siRNAs was used to knockdown PP2A-Aα
  protein expression for 24 hours. Western blotting analysis was used to assess cytoplasmic
  versus nuclear localization as well as expression of the ATF4 and its downstream
  target genes after DT-061 treatment in both siControl (negative control) and siPP2A-Aα.
  F) Whole cell lysate of the conditions previously described in E) was also collected
  to evaluate the expression of cell death markers and ER-associated autophagy. Western
  blotting analysis was performed (left) and represented as z-score values in a heatmap
  obtained through western blot quantification (right). Calculated z-scores were obtained
  from protein quantification of three independent biological replicates.'
