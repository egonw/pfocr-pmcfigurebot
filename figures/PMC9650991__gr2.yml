caption: 'CD34+cells from donors with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination
  are highly susceptible to apoptosis via IFN-γ-related pathways(A) % Annexin-V positivity
  of CD34+ cell fractions. MNCs obtained from donors double-positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N
  and S protein IgGs (N+/S+) were used for CD34+ cell purification by autoMACS. 0.25 × 106
  CD34+ cells (>98% purity) were used for staining with Biolegend PE Annexin-V and
  7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptotic cells by Annexin-V+/7-AAD- as
  in . Displayed are the means with standard deviation bars. p values of unpaired
  two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction: ns (p>0.05).(B) Bar plot showing enrichment
  in different gene ontology (GO) terms predicted by GO analysis of top differentially
  expressed genes (p≤0.05).(C) Heatmap representing differentially expressed genes
  belonging to the “IFN-γ-mediated signaling pathway” and “Cellular response to IFN-γ”
  gene ontology terms significantly suppressed in CD34+ cells from the N+/S+ non-vaccinated
  donor group. N1-N4: samples from negative group (n = 4), DP1-DP4: samples from the
  N+/S+ non-vaccinated group (n = 4).'
