caption: 'Graphical summary illustrating the functional evidences of GSCs existence
  in pHGG (A), their generation and maintenance in pHGG (B), the role of the SVZ (C),
  and the signaling pathways involved in GSC-features (D). While there is no clear
  consensus, glioma stem cells (GSC) are classically defined based on multiple functional
  criteria, including the expression of different levels and patterns of surface and
  intracellular markers, the formation of spherical colonies in suspension cultures,
  a higher resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy compared to the non-GSCs tumoral
  cells and the potential to recapitulate the initial tumor heterogeneity (A). scRNA-seq
  analysis of primary Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) H3 K27-altered showed that tumor
  cells are mostly constituted of cells that resemble oligodendrocyte precursor cells,
  which display an enhanced proliferative and tumor-propagating capacity compared
  to the minority of more differentiated cells (astrocyte-like and oligodendrocyte-like)
  (B). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a key actor in pediatric high-grade gliomas
  (pHGG), as suggested by the recent in vivo demonstration that DMG cells injected
  in the pons migrate towards the SVZ in response to chemoattractant signals secreted
  by SVZ-hosted neural precursor cell. This chemoattractant effect depends on the
  pleiotrophin (PTN) and its three binding partners and is mediated by the PTN receptor
  protein tyrosine phosphate receptor type Z and the activation of the Rho/Rho kinase
  pathway (C). Several signaling pathways are shared between neural stem cells and
  pediatric GSC and are involved in gliogenesis, resistance to radiotherapy, and stem-like
  phenotype of pHGG (D). Abbreviations: AC: astrocyte; ALDH: aldehyde dehydrogenase;
