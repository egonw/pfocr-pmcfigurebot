caption: DPA promoted osteogenic differentiation via ERK signaling pathway. (A) The
  expression of phosphorylated-ERK, JNK and p38 of hBMSCs treated with DPA (0, 10,
  20, 40 ÂµM). (B) The expression of phosphorylated-ERK, JNK and p38 of hBMSCs treated
  with miR-9-5p mimic and miR-9-5p inhibitor (anti-miR-9-5p). (C) The mineralization
  of hBMSCs pretreated with ERK specific inhibitor PD98059 for 24 hr with or without
  DPA for 7 days was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and ALP activity. (D-E) The
  osteogenesis-related gene expression (including ALP, OPN and OCN) of hBMSCs pretreated
  with ERK specific inhibitor PD98059 for 24 hr with or without DPA for 7 days was
  measured by qRT-PCR (D) and western blot (E) assays. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001 vs OIM group.
