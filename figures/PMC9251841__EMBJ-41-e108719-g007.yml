figure_title: Disruption of microtubules has no effect on cellular response to hydrostatic
  pressure in WT and Y/T DKO cells
caption: Confocal IF images labelled with Hoechst (Blue) and alpha tubulin (green)
  showing loss of microtubule structures in response to 10 min nocodazole (NCD) treatment
  in WT, Y/T DKO and LATS1/2 DKO cells. Scale bar = 20 μm.Confocal IF images labelled
  with Hoechst (blue) and phalloidin (red) visualizing the actin cytoskeleton organization
  in response to NCD treatment. Scale bar = 10 μm.Steady‐state cell volume of nocodazole‐treated
  cells compared to control. Each dot represents a single cell and data pooled from
  five independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U
  test. P = 0.1925 (WT), P = 0.9008 (Y/T DKO) and P = 0.1375 (LATS1/2 DKO).Cell response
  to hydrostatic pressure after 10 min NCD treatment compared to control. Each dot
  represents a single cell and data pooled from five independent experiments. Error
  bars represent mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. P = 0.4240 (WT), P = 0.7567 (Y/T
  DKO) and ***P < 0.001 (LATS1/2 DKO).Cell response to hydrostatic pressure after
  CytD (40 min) and NCD (10 min) treatment compared to control. Each dot represents
  a single cell and data pooled from four independent experiments. Error bars represent
  mean ± 95% CI. Mann–Whitney U test. ***P < 0.001 (WT) and P > 0.9999 (LATS1/2 DKO).
