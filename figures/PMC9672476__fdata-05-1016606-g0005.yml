caption: WINNER upstream prioritization more accurately identifies the relative position
  of genes in a pathway. Gene-gene regulatory relationships from STRING v.10.5 were
  used to distribute genes from all KEGG cancer pathways into 7 layers via WINNER
  (customized for upstream ranking), PageRank, and Dual Rank; genes coding for proteins
  that function further upstream in the pathways were assigned to the lower-numbered
  layers. Layers 1–3 are the most upstream layers, usually correspond to the kineases,
  grow factors, and receptors. Layers 4–7 are downstream, usually correspond to signaling
  hubs, phospholization, transcription factors, and inside-nucleus genes. The y axis
  indicates the ranking scores, which were converted into percentile so that the rankings
  across different pathways could be combined into one boxplot. The red cross implies
  boxplot outliners (beyond 2 and 98% percentiles). (A) WINNER upstream rank. (B)
  PageRank. (C) Dual node-edge rank.
