caption: HCRP-1 overexpression inhibits OSCC cell proliferation. HCRP-1 mRNA and protein
  expression levels in oral epithelial and OSCC cells were determined using (A) RT-qPCR
  and (B) western blotting, respectively. CAL-27 cells were transfected to overexpress
  HCRP-1, and (C) RT-qPCR and (D) western blotting were performed to verify transfection
  efficiency. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. Transfected cell proliferation was assessed
  using the (E) Cell Counting Kit-8 and (F) colony formation assays. ***P<0.001 vs.
  Ov-NC. HCRP-1, hepatocellular carcinoma-related protein 1; OSCC, oral squamous cell
  carcinoma; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; Ov-, overexpression;
  NC, negative control; HIOEC, human immortalized oral epithelial cell.
article_title: HCRP-1 alleviates the malignant phenotype and angiogenesis of oral
  squamous cell carcinoma cells via the downregulation of the EGFR/STAT3 signaling
  pathway.
