caption: Characterization of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. (A) UMAP clustering of
  fibroblast cells (n = 11,517), cell cycle phase and pseudotime trajectory analysis
  from the human bladder. (B) UMAP clustering of fibroblast cells (n = 3296), cell
  cycle phase and pseudotime trajectory analysis from rat bladder. (C) UMAP clustering
  of fibroblast cells (n = 12,157), cell cycle phase and pseudotime trajectory analysis
  from mouse bladders. (D) Comparison of the numbers of each subpopulation of fibroblasts
  in bladder tissues from humans, rats and mouse. (E) Pearson correlation analysis
  of the average expression level between fibroblasts among human, rat and mouse bladder
  tissue. (F) Venny plot indicating overlapping marker genes among subpopulations
  in the three species. (G) GO pathway enrichment analysis of highly overlapping marker
  genes among subpopulations of fibroblasts.
