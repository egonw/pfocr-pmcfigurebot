figure_title: Expression array analysis of Hh-signaling genes during E. chaffeensis
  infection
caption: (A) Volcano plots showing the differential expression of Hh-signaling pathway
  genes between E. chaffeensis-infected (MOI 100) and uninfected THP-1 cells at 4
  h (top left), 8 h (top right), 24 h (bottom left) and 48 hpi (bottom right). The
  red, black and green dots in the volcano plot represent upregulation (≥ 2), no change,
  and down-regulation (≤ -2), respectively. The horizontal blue lines on the volcano
  plots determine the level of significance (≤ 0.05). Genes were significantly upregulated
  at all time points. (B) Normalized expression of Hh array genes in component, target
  and associated gene categories between E. chaffeensis-infected and uninfected cells
  at 48 hpi. Cells were harvested with three biological and technical replicates for
  all time points.
