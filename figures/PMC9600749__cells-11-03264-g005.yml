caption: Signaling pathway abnormalities implicated in muscle wasting were improved
  or normalized with repletion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in Ctns−/− mice. qPCR was used
  to determine expression levels of negative regulators of skeletal muscle mass (IL-1β,
  IL-6, TNF-α, Atrogin-1, Murf-1, and Myostatin) and pro-myogenic factors (Myod, Myogenin,
  and Pax7) in gastrocnemius muscle (A–I, respectively). Results are expressed and
  analyzed as in . ns signifies not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001.
