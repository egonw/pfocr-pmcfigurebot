caption: Effect of 9r on apoptosis-associated proteins. (A–D) Immunoblot analysis
  of apoptosis-associated proteins in SH-SY5Y cells after 9r pretreatment. The Image
  Lab application was used to determine the grey intensity of p53, Cl-PARP and Bax/Bcl2.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Compared to
  the given control group, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001. Compared to the H2O2−treated
  group, &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01 and &&&p < 0.001.
article_title: Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel 1,4-Disubstituted Piperazine-2,5-dione
  Derivatives as Antioxidants against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Injury via the IL-6/Nrf2
  Loop Pathway.
