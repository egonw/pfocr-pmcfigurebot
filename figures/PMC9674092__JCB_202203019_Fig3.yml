caption: Motile cilia components are induced in astrocytes with mitochondrial dysfunction
  or growth signaling inhibition. (Aâ€“E) Includes RNA sequencing, astrocytes purified
  from TwKOastro compared to control mice. The dataset is described in . (A) Schematic
  representation of cilia cross-section. Axonemes of both primary and motile cilia
  comprise nine doublet microtubules. Motile cilia also harbor components that are
  not present in primary cilia. (B) Expression of structural components specific to
  motile cilia and other factors involved in axoneme assembly and motility in astrocytes
  of TwKOastro mice compared to control mice. (C) Expression of pan-ciliary and primary
  cilia factors in astrocytes purified from TwKOastro compared to control mice. IFT
  = intraflagellar transport; BBBsome = a component of the basal body; Hh signaling
  = hedgehog signaling pathway. (D) Protein and RNA expression of motile or pan-ciliary
  and specific to primary cilia factors in astrocytes purified from TwKOastro compared
  to control mice. Note that IFT22, IFT57, IFT74, WDR19, and IFT140 are IFT complex
  components (). Stars indicate q-value <0.01. (E) Regulation of motile ciliogenic
  program in astrocytes upon various insults and upon tissue-specific mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Heat maps (top panel) and stacked bar charts (bottom panel). Datasets
  are from this study (described in ) and from ; ; ; ; . MCC, multiciliated cell;
  SCI, spinal cord injury; mot ctx, motor cortex; vis ctx, visual cortex. Expression
  data for some of these genes are also presented in , , and .
