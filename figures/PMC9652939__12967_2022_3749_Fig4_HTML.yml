caption: MICAL1 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PC. A Scatter plot of top 15
  enriched KEGG pathways. B MICAL1 stable overexpression cells, MICAL1 stable silencing
  cells and their respective control cells were transfected with the TOP/FOP Flash
  reporter plasmids and the luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection.
  C Established downstream target genes of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, including CCND1,
  CD44, CMYC, MMP7, TCF4, and TWIST1 were detected by RT-qPCR in indicated cells.
  D Crucial proteins of WNT pathway including phosphorylation β-catenin at Ser45 site,
  β-catenin, GSK-3b, AXIN1, APC and intracellular β-catenin were detected by western
  blotting in indicated cells. Data represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  and were analyzed by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test, ns = no significance,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
