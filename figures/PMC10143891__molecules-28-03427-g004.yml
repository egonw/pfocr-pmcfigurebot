caption: (A–C). Heatmap showing the relative gene expression of lipid metabolism pathway,
  PPAR signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis according to the results
  of RNA-seq. Log2 fold change is represented by the horizontal axis, and genes are
  represented by the vertical axis. Red indicates up-regulation, and blue indicates
  down-regulation in expression. (D). PPI network for 76 lipid metabolism proteins
  in the liver of mice with CF ethyl acetate extract treatment. (E). Up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. (F). Protein levels of PPARα,
  Fabp2 as measured by Western blot. GAPDH was used as the control protein. Bars represent
  the mean ± SD. The statistically significant differences from the control were defined
  as ***, p < 0.001.
