caption: 'Effect of V. album summer mother tinctures on the MDA-MB-231 glycolysis
  and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes. HK, PFK-1, PK (glycolytic enzymes), and G6PDH
  (Pentose Phosphate Pathway) were analyzed after 48 h (black bars) and 72 h (grey
  bars) of the treatment with A-S (1.0% and 2.0% v/v) and Q-S (0.5% and 1% v/v). Mean
  values ±standard error of two independent experiments (n = 2). *p ≤ 0.05 were compared
  to control (ethanol at the same concentration of MTs) by nonparametric Mann-Whitney
  test. Legend symbols: V. album subsp. abietis growing on Abies alba in summer (A–S);
  V. album subsp. album growing on Quercus petraea in summer (Q–S).'
