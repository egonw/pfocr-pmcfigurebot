caption: 'Knockdown of YBX1 in prostate cancer cells reverses the carcinogenic effects
  of CASC11. YBX1 knockdown reversed the OE-CASC11-induced (A and B) proliferation
  (scale bar, 500 µm) and (C and D) migration (scale bar, 100 µm) of LNCaP and 22Rv1
  cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. (E) Western blot analysis demonstrated that YBX1 knockdown
  abolished the OE-CASC11-induced promotion of Cyclin A2, CDK2 and CDK4 proteins.
  (F) Western blot analysis demonstrated that YBX1 overexpression reversed the sh-CASC11-induced
  increase in the expression levels of p21 and p53 proteins. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs.
  the control group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. the OE-CASC11 or sh-CASC11 group. CASC11,
  cancer susceptibility candidate 11; NC, negative control; OE-CASC11, CASC11 overexpression
  plasmid; sh, short hairpin; YBX1, Y-box binding protein 1.'
article_title: Long non-coding RNA CASC11 interacts with YBX1 to promote prostate
  cancer progression by suppressing the p53 pathway.
