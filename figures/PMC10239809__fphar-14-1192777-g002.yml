caption: Pseudotime time series analysis, enrichment analysis, and cell communication
  analysis of 10 × scRNA-seq data from ovarian cancer. (A–C) Cell trajectory analysis
  and pseudotime of identified immune cell types. (D) Functional enrichment analysis
  of all cell types using the “ReactomeGSA” software package. (E,F) Cellular communication
  networks were inferred by calculating the likelihood of communication. Studies of
  intercellular communication networks suggest that the CXCL signaling pathway plays
  an important role in intercellular communication networks.
