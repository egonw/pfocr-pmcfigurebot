figure_title: Quantitative (phospho-)proteomics reveals paladin involvement in diseases
  and kinase/phosphatase activities
caption: A Volcano plots displaying relative variation of protein abundance in HCT116
  paladin shRNA clones. B Volcano plots displaying a relative variation of phospho-protein
  abundance in HCT116 paladin shRNA clones. C Heatmaps representing diseases highlighted
  by gene enrichment analysis. Results are presented as –log10P value. D Heatmaps
  representing top 20 kinases (out of 413) or phosphatases (out of 55) obtained from
  literature mining and able to catalyse phospho modifications induced by paladin
  depletion. Results are presented as –log10P value. E Potential pathway altered by
  paladin depletion. Kinases and phosphatases able to catalyse phospho modifications
  induced by paladin depletion are depicted in red and blue, respectively. Inferred
  proteins, considered the core pathway to further analyse, are depicted in green.
article_title: Paladin, overexpressed in colon cancer, is required for actin polymerisation
  and liver metastasis dissemination.
