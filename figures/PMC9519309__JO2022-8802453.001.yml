caption: 'EO suppressed the viability of human TNBC cells. The viability of TNBC cell
  lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 and normal epithelial cell line MCF 10A treated
  with different concentrations of EO for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h measured by MTT. Unless
  otherwise specified, all results were presented as mean ± SD. n = 3. EO, Eupalinolide
  O; TNBC, Triple-negative breast cancer; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide. #p < 0.05, and ##p < 0.01 vs. Control, in all figures.'
