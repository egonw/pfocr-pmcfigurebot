caption: Induction of the mTOR pathway in a UUO mouse model with mTOR ODN injection.
  (A) Representative immunofluorescence images showed the effect of mTOR ODNs on UUO-induced
  activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. The phospho-p70S6kinase was labeled with
  Alexa Fluor 555 (red). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 50 μm.
  (B) Western blot analysis results showed that synthetic mTOR ODN regulated mTOR
  signaling pathway-related molecules, p70 and p-4E-BP1. (C) The results are expressed
  as the mean ± SE of three independent determinations. * p < 0.05 vs. NC group. † p
  < 0.05 vs. mTOR group. ‡ p < 0.05 vs. UUO or Scr group. UUO, unilateral ureteral
  obstruction; ODNs, oligonucleotides; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NC, normal
  control; mTOR, injected with mTOR ODNs; UUO, UUO surgery; UUO + Scr, underwent UUO
  surgery and injected with scrambled ODNs; UUO + mTOR, underwent UUO surgery and
  injected with mTOR ODNs; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
