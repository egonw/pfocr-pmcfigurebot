figure_title: Proinflammatory signaling pathways were decreased in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated
  compared to sham unvaccinated hamsters
caption: (A) Boxplots of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts normalized read counts across all
  animals, vaccinated hamsters are shown in blue and pink, and sham animals in green.
  (B) Sample-enrichment analysis (SLEA) of inflammatory pathways and interferon signaling
  increased by SARS-CoV-2 at 4 dpi in sham unvaccinated hamsters (in green) and decreased
  in vaccinated hamsters (in pink and blue) compared to naïve uninfected animals (in
  red). Heatmap presenting the SLEA z-score of each of these pathways. SLEA represents
  the mean expression of all significant genes within each pathway for each animal.
  An SLEA z-score greater than 0 corresponds to a pathway for which member genes are
  up-regulated, while an SLEA z-score inferior to 0 corresponds to a pathway with
  genes downregulated in that sample. Columns correspond to individual animals, and
  rows correspond to individual pathways scaled across all animals using the z-score
  R function. (C) Gene heatmaps of the row scaled expression of the leading genes
  from pathways shown in panel A increased or decreased at 4 dpi in vaccinated hamsters
  compared to sham unvaccinated and control naïve animals. Adjusted P-values (<0.05)
  were calculated by DEseq2 using Benjamini-Hochberg corrections of Wald test p-values.
  Columns correspond to individual animals, and rows correspond to individual genes.
  (D) Bar plots represent the log2 fold change mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1, IL-1R,
  and Furin across all groups. The length of the bar plot represents the log2-fold
  change compared to control animals, and the color gradient corresponds to the BH-adjusted
  p-values for each gene. (E) Heatmaps of proinflammatory markers and proinflammatory
  cytokines at 4 dpi in vaccinated hamsters compared to sham unvaccinated and control
  naïve animals. Adjusted P-values (<0.05) were calculated by DEseq2 using Benjamini-Hochberg
  corrections of Wald test p-values. Columns correspond to individual animals, and
  rows correspond to individual genes scaled across all animals. (F) Percent area
  of lung tissue staining positive for Mx1. Mx1 = myxovirus protein 1 (type 1 interferon-inducible
  gene) in vaccinated compared to sham unvaccinated hamsters. Kruskall-Wallis one-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Red line = median. (G) Correlation
  matrix plot showing the Spearman correlation of interferon and inflammatory signatures
  at 4 dpi with viral loads in hamster’s lung and nares at 4 dpi and neutralizing
  and binding antibody titers at weeks 2–4 post-vaccination. Negative correlations
  were shown in cyan, and positive correlations were shown in pink.
