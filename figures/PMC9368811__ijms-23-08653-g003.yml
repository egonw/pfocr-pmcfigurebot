caption: miRNAs involved in SST2 signaling. SST2 acts to inhibit adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) through inhibitory G protein. AIP also stimulates this inhibition. AC turns
  ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (PKA) that, through
  its pathway, leads to cell proliferation, growth, and hormone secretion. miR-34a
  targets AIP and G inhibitory  subunit and it is also inhibited by AIP by unknown
  mechanisms. miR-185 directly targets SST2 mRNA and might play a role in decreasing
  SST2 levels. Figure adapted from “Activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA)”, by BioRender.com
