caption: ABA biosynthesis during strawberry fruit development. a Changes in transcript
  levels of the main genes involved in ABA biosynthesis, metabolism, and ABA and auxin
  content during strawberry fruit development. b ABA biosynthetic pathway in strawberry
  fruit. Red arrows indicate reactions that increase ABA, blue arrows show metabolic
  reactions reducing active ABA content, and the inhibitory step in green promotes
  ABA accumulation by inhibiting its metabolism. The NCED, AOG, BG, and CYP707A genes
  have been described [, , , â€“].
