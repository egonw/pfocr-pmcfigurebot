caption: 'Pharmacological inhibition of CBS with AOAA restores the suppressed cell
  proliferation and viability of DS fibroblasts, without adversely affecting cell
  viability. Quantification of (A): BrdU incorporation, a marker of cell proliferation,
  (B): XTT metabolization, a marker of mitochondrial function and overall cell viability
  and (C): LDH levels in the supernatant, a marker of cell necrosis and the breakdown
  of the cell membrane permeability were assessed. Each line and bar graph represents
  the mean ± SEM of n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts and n = 8 DS fibroblasts,
  as summarized in . Dotted connecting lines indicate the same cell from a specific
  donor with/without AOAA treatment (3 μM, 24 h). **p ≤ 0.01 indicates significant
  differences between DSC untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05 and ##p ≤ 0.01 indicate
  significant differences between CC + AOAA vs. CC untreated or DSC + AOAA vs. DSC
  untreated.'
