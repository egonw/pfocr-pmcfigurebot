caption: Fucoxanthin reverses EMT and cell motility by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. Cell lines were incubated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and/or fucoxanthin (25 μM
  or 50 μM), XAV939 (25 μM) for 48 h. A The levels of EMT-related protein were evaluated
  by Western Blot analysis, as indicated. B Wound healing assay (Magnification, × 100)
  and C Transwell assay (Magnification, × 200) were performed to assess the cell migration
  and invasion abilities. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared to control group, △P < 0.05
  compared to TGF-β1 group. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. One-way
  ANOVA were used to assess differences between groups. The SPSS 25.0 software (USA)
  used for creation of the figure
