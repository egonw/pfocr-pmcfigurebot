caption: 'NF-κB pathway activation in CD8 T cells. (A-B) Gel images (A) and densitometric
  quantification bar graphs (B) showing relative protein levels for Epsti1 and IκBα
  in wild-type CD8 T cells after siRNA knockdown of Epsti1 (n = 2 replicates per group).
  (C) Bar graphs showing the average percentages of si-Scramble-or si-Epsti1-transduced
  CD8 T cells positive for CD69 (A), Ifn-γ (B) or Tnf-α (C) following 24 hr co-stimulation
  with CD3/CD38 antibodies. (D-I) Gel images and densitometric quantification (bar
  graphs) showing relative protein levels for CD8 T-cell lysates (D-G) or CD4 T-cell
  lysates (H-I) of total and phosphorylated protein levels of canonical NF-κB pathway
  members (n = 3 per replicates per group). Abbreviations: Cyt, cytoplasmic fraction;
  Nuc, nuclear fraction. P values were determined by unpaired Student’s t-test.'
article_title: Tbc1d10c is a selective, constitutive suppressor of the CD8 T-cell
  anti-tumor response.
