caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. (A): Differentially expressed
  gene KEGG pathway bubble map. The horizontal coordinates indicate the proportion
  of enriched differential genes to the background genes of the pathway, and the vertical
  coordinates indicate the name of the pathway; the size of the dots in the graph
  indicates the number of enriched differential genes, and the color indicates the
  p-value. The size of the dots in the graph indicates the number of enriched differential
  genes, and the color indicates the p-value. (B): Distribution of differentially
  expressed gene KEGG pathway enrichment.'
