figure_title: Fatostatin attenuates the EMT process of GBM cells
caption: 'A–D Wound-healing assays were used to detect the migration of U87 and U251
  cells after fatostatin treatment. Scale bars: 200 µm. E–G Transwell assays were
  used to detect the invasion of U87 and U251 cells after fatostatin treatment. Scale
  bars: 50 µm. H, I Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of E-ca,
  N-ca, Snail1, and Vimentin in U87 and U251 cells after fatostatin treatment for
  24 h. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
