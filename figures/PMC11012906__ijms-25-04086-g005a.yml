caption: 'Functional analysis of MRE recognition sequences of RECK gene by miR-21.
  Panel (A): Nucleotide sequences of MRE21-1, MRE21-2, and MRE21-3 of RECK 3′-UTR
  regulatory region. Nucleotide sequences of microRNAs response elements of miR-21
  (MRE21-1 of 3343 to 3366 nt, MRE21-2 of 3893 to 3918 nt, and MRE21-3 of 4039 to
  4061 nt) and complementary with RECK 3′-UTR are indicated. Information was generated
  from the nucleotide sequence database for RECK [NCBI: NM_021111.3] and for hsa-mir-21
  [miRbase: MI0000077]. Annealing was generated from the miRTarBase website database.
  Panel (B): Regulation of RECK 3′-UTR region modulated by miR-21 microRNA in CaSki
  and SiHa cells non-transfected (NT, lane 1) or transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6
  empty vector (lane 2), with pMIR-Report-Luciferase empty vector (lane 3), transfected
  with pMRE21RECKLuc1 (MRE21-1, lane 4), co-transfected with pMRE21RECKLuc1 and pSIMIR21-5P
  (lane 5), transfected with pMRE21RECKLuc2 (MRE21-2, lane 6), co-transfected with
  pMRE21RECKLuc2 and pSIMIR21-5P (lane 7), transfected with pMRE21RECKLuc3 (MRE21-3,
  lane 8), co-transfected with pMRE21RECKLuc3 and pSIMIR21-5P (lane 9) plasmids. After
  48 h of transfection, luciferase activity levels were measured. The data shown represent
  the average of four independent experiments. p values < 0.05 are indicated with
  an asterisk.'
