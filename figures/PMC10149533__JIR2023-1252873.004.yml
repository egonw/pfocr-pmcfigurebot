caption: 'Effect of morroniside on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in EIU mice. (a)
  JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 protein expression in ciliary body tissues. (b)
  JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 protein expression in retinal tissues. Means ± SD
  from three independent samples are shown. The data in western blot assays were expressed
  after normalization to β-actin expression. Comparison with the control group:  ∗∗P
