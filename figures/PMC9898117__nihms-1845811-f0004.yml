  in lymphoma cells
caption: '(A) High mRNA levels of Ig were observed in Core Tg mice with enlarged spleens,
  as judged by immunoglobulin RT-qPCR assay (n=3) (P=0.0152). Data are represented
  as mean ± S.D.(B) High mRNA levels of AID were observed in Core Tg mice with enlarged
  spleens (n=3) (P=0.0431). Data are represented as mean ± S.D.(C) Full-length CD86
  (CD86: B7.2_FL) or the fusion form of CD86 and CD8 were overexpressed in sh-CD86-transduced
  Raji cells. Luciferase assay revealed HCV-mediated Igκpromoter transactivation was
  abrogated in the CD86/CD8 group, indicating the intracellular domain of CD86 plays
  a role in the activation of interferon signaling pathway (n=3, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).
  Data is represented as mean ± S.D.(D) CD81 and CD86 are important for SB genotype
  induced, Ig activity shown by immunoglobulin qPCR assay. Wild-type (WT) or mutant
  (Mut) CD81 forms were overexpressed in CD81 and CD86 double-knockout (DKO) Raji
  cells. After antibiotics selection, cells were infected with SB pseudoparticle (SB
  HCVpp) for 24 hours. Infected cells were harvested for qPCR assay. Overexpression
  of WT CD81 induced IgM expression, but not in cells transfected with CD81 mutant.
  More interestingly, this phenomenon was abrogated in CD81 and CD86 DKO cells, implying
  that both CD81 and CD86 were important for SB induced Ig activity (n=3, ***P<0.001).
  Data are represented as mean ± S.D.'
