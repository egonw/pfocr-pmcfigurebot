caption: miR-637 suppresses stem-like characteristics in ESCC cells by inhibiting
  IL-8 expression. A, B qRT-PCR (A) and ELISA (B) assays showed the expression levels
  of IL-8 in KYSE70 cells and KYSE450 cells after treatment with negative control
  (NC) mimic or miR-637 mimic. C, D qRT-PCR (C) and ELISA (D) assays showed the expression
  levels of IL-8 in KYSE70 cells and KYSE450 cells after treatment with NC inhibitor
  or miR-637 inhibitor. E, F The number of spheres derived from KYSE70 cells and KYSE450
  cells after treatment with treated with miR-637 mimic (E) or miR-637 inhibitor (F).
  G The number of spheres derived from IL-8 overexpressing (OE-IL-8) KYSE450 cells
  after treatment with miR-637 mimic. Scale bar, 200 μm. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  deviation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

  and serves as a novel prognostic marker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
