caption: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 protein and mRNA levels. A. Nrf2
  expression before and after relaxin 2 (RLXH2) treatment. B. Densitometry of Nrf2
  bands (**; P<0.01 at 12 hours compared to 0 hours, and P<0.05 at 24 hours compared
  to 12 hours). C. Nrf2 mRNA levels significantly increased after RLXH2 treatment
  (*; P<0.05 both for 12 hours compared to 0 hour and for 24 hours compared to 12
  hours). The results are the average of an independent experiment

  Damage and Cell Death via Activation of The Nrf2/HO-1 Signalling Pathway in Gastric
  Cancer Cells.
