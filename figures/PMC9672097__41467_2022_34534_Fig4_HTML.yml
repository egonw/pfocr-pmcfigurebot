figure_title: Pathway analysis resulting from Aedes aegypti mosquito bites over time
caption: A Chord plot shows significantly upregulated genes at 4 h and 48 h post-bite
  over NSK (left side of chord plot) and overrepresented pathways (right side of chord
  plot). Outer left ring shows genes and color range displays log2 fold change (FC)
  (left, key at bottom) or Reactome terms (outer right ring). Chords connect gene
  names with Reactome term pathways. B Heatmap (scaled to log2FC) displaying a list
  of DEGs based on the common pathways overrepresented at 4 and 48 h post-bite.
