caption: Pathway enrichment of differentially expressed proteins/genes in monocytes
  at 6 months after sargramostim treatment. (A) GO‐term functional enrichment by five
  categories (immune response, biological process, cellular component, KEGG, and Reactome)
  was performed using Cytoscape in conjunction with the plug‐in ClueGO. (B) Canonical
  pathway enrichment analysis was performed using IPA (Qiagen). Black arrows point
  to the state of canonical pathways illustrated in Figure (B); orange colour (activation),
  blue colour (inhibition), and grey colour (no activity pattern)
