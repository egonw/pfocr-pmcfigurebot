caption: LTB4R overexpression promoted the cell period and inhibited apoptosis of
  ccRCC cells. (A,B) LTB4R overexpression inhibited apoptosis of Caki1 and ACHN cells,
  respectively. (Câ€“F) After LTB4R overexpression, the proportion of G1/G0 phase in
  Caki1 and ACHN cells decreased, whereas the proportion of G2/M phase increased,
  and the proportion of S phase did not significantly change. (G) Western blot analysis
  showed that after LTB4R overexpression, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins
  BAX and c-CASP3 (c-caspase-3) decreased, and the expression of anti-apoptotic protein
  BCL2 increased. (H) Western blot analysis showed that the expression of period-related
  proteins CCND1 (cyclin D1), CDK2, and CDK4 increased after LTB4R overexpression.
  A 2-tailed t test was used (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; and ns, not
  significant).
