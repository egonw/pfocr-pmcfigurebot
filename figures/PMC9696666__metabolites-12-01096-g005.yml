caption: Annotated alanine, aspartate, and glutamate pathway with associated metabolite
  ion images by IR-MALDESI. Other metabolites associated with glutamate are detected
  in this study and are shown in ion images grouped with respect to disease classification
  (top right). Purple circles along conversion arrows indicate protein detection,
  while white circles are indicative of no detection in the post-mortem brain samples
  from previous proteomic studies.
