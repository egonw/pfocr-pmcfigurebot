caption: BTG3 was a target of miR-18a-5p in CRC. A. StarBase software (http:// starbase.sysu.edu.cn/)
  predicted a binding site between BTG3 3ˊUTR and miR-18a-5p. Other potential targets
  of miR-18a-5p predicted on the StarBase website were detailed in  (See Supplementary
  Online Information at www.celljournal.org). B. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay
  was used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-18a-5p and BTG3. C. qRT-PCR
  was used to detect the expression of BTG3 mRNA in CRC tissues and adjacent normal
  tissues (n=65). D. The expression of BTG3 mRNA in normal colorectal mucosal cell
  line (FHC) and CRC cell lines (Colo-678, HCT116, SW620, LoVo cells) was detected
  by qRT-PCR. E. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of BTG3 protein
  in CRC cell lines (Colo-678, HCT116, SW620, LoVo cells) and FHC cells. The original
  blot images were provided in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org).
  F, G. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to detect the expression of BTG3
  mRNA and protein in CRC cells transfected with miR-18a-5p mimic, CASC2 overexpression
  plasmid or co-transfected with miR-18a-5p and CASC2, respectively. The original
  blot images were provided in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org).
  H, I. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to detect the correlations between
  BTG3 mRNA and miR-18a-5p, or BTG3 mRNA and CASC2 expression in CRC tissues. Data
  are represented as the mean ± SD (n=3). The data were analyzed by MannWhitney test
  or one-way ANOVA. **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, CRC; Colorectal cancer, and qRT-PCR;
