caption: Quercetin alleviated ER stress-mediated apoptosis in NEFA-treated BMECs.
  Cells were pre-treated with quercetin (10 μM) for 24 h, then treated with 0.9 mM
  NEFA for 6 h. (A) Protein expression of ER stress marker proteins GRP78, HSP70,
  ATF4, and CHOP. (B) Protein expression of apoptosis marker proteins Bax and Bcl2.
  (C) Cell apoptosis detected by flow cytometry using annexin V FITC/PI double staining.
  Data are presented as the means ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
