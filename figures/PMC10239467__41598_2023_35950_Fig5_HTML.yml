caption: 'Transcriptome (QuantSeq) profiling of IP6K2 and XPO4 knockout clones. (a,
  b) GSEA analysis of the C4_Cas9 (WT), C4_scc_IP6K2_3, and C4_scc_XPO4_2 cell lines.
  Only significantly enriched/depleted signatures are shown (FDR < 0.05 after 1000
  permutations). KO: Knockout. NES: Normalized enrichment score. (c, d) Enrichr analysis
  showing the top ten significant (unadjusted p-value < 0.05) pathways/ontologies
  from five different databases based on genes that were differentially expressed
  between vehicle (DMSO) and enzalutamide-treated C4_scc_IP6K2_3 (n = 90) or C4_scc_XPO4_2
  (n = 67) cells, but not differentially expressed in C4_Cas9 cells (Supplementary
  Data ). The x-axis shows the combined score (multiplied log of Fisher’s exact test
  p-value and z-score) for each pathway, as determined by Enrichr analysis. The y-axis
  shows the unadjusted Fisher’s exact test p-value, as determined by Enrichr analysis.'
