caption: rhS100A9 activated NF‐κB signalling pathway by enhancing nuclear translocation
  of NF‐κB large subunit, P65. Immunofluorescence showed that P65 was expressed both
  in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of NP cells. Comparative analysis indicated the
  increased expression of P65 in the cell nuclei of NP cells after treatment with
  rhS100A9 for 6 hours (A). Inhibition of NF‐κB signalling pathway demonstrated that
  rhS100A9 induced NP cell apoptosis through NF‐κB signalling pathway. The increased
  expressions of the pro‐apoptotic protein markers that were induced by rhS100A9 treatment
  for 6 hours and 12 hours were reversed by administration of SC75741, a NF‐κB specific
  inhibitor (B, C). NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa‐B; NP, nucleus pulposus

  of the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
