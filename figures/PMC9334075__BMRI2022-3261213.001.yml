caption: miR-149 was significantly low expressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cells.
  (a) Differentially expressed microRNA in microRNA expression microarray GSE67268
  of osteosarcoma tissues. (b) qRT-PCR detection of miR-149 expression levels in cancer
  tissues and paired paraneoplastic tissues of 42 osteosarcoma patients. (c–e) Analysis
  of miR-149 451a expression levels in relation to clinical stage, lymph node metastasis,
  and differentiation level of osteosarcoma patients. (f) miR-149 expression levels
  in normal human esophageal epithelial cells HET-1A and osteosarcoma cell lines SAOS-2,
  osteosarcoma 9706, and MG63. In (b–e), each point represents one sample, and data
  were analyzed for differences using the paired or unpaired test; ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001. In (f), data were analyzed for differences using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's
  multiple comparison test for analysis of variance on data; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
