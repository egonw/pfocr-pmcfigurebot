caption: KEGG pathways in carbohydrate metabolism with the metagenomic analysis. (a)
  Relative abundance of the KEGG orthologies (KOs) associated with carbohydrate metabolism
  in fecal samples was inferred based on the metagenome analysis. (b) A comparison
  of KOs of the fructose and mannose metabolism pathways in individuals obtained from
  the metagenome analysis of fecal samples using a heatmap calculated by multiplying
  individual metagenomic genes and a number of bacteria. The green rectangle indicates
  the gut microbial fructose and mannose metabolism KOs with high variability, and
  red and blue rectangles indicate groups of individuals having relatively higher
  and lower expressions of these highly variable KOs, respectively. (c) A list of
  16 KOs with high individual variability in gene expression that was identified from
  (b). (d) Summary of a metabolic pathway that involves many KOs listed in (c).
