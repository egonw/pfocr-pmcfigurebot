caption: Fun30 protein of C. albicans mediates double-strand break end resection.
  qPCR was performed on genomic DNA isolated from wild type (JKM179-URA3-YepHIS),
  fun30∆ YepHIS, and fun30∆ overexpressing CaFUN30 (fun30∆-YepHIS-CaFUN30) cells at
  the indicated distances from the DSB in the (A). absence of galactose, and (B).
  presence of galactose.
