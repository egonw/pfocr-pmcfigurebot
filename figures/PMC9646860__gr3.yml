caption: 'LIF promoted proliferation, activation of rat fibroblasts through ERK1/2
  and STAT3 pathway. (a) NRK49F cells were incubated with LIF (6 ng/ml or 12 ng/ml)
  for 24 h or 48 h, and then cell numbers were counted. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus
  controls (n = 3). (b and c) Representative micrographs of BrdU incorporation and
  quantitative determination of the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. Arrows indicate
  BrdU-positive cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus controls (n = 3).
  (d and e) Western blot analyses (d) and quantitative data (e) showed that LIF upregulated
  the expression of proliferation and activation-related proteins in fibroblasts in
  a dose-dependent manner. NRK49F cells were incubated with indicated concentrations
  of LIF for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis for c-Myc,
  Cyclin-D1, α-SMA, TNC, Fibronectin, and COL1A1. β-actin was used to verify equivalent
  loading. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus controls (n = 4). (f and g) Representative
  Western blot (f) and quantitative data (g) showed that LIF induced phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner. NRK49F cells were treated with indicated concentration
  of LIF for 30 min. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus controls (n = 4). (h and i) NRK49F
  cells were treated with gradient concentration of LIF for 2 h. Representative Western
  blot (h) and quantitative data (i) showed that LIF induced phosphorylation of STAT3
  in a dose-dependent manner. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus controls (n = 4). (j and
  k) Representative Western blot (j) and quantitative data (k) showed that blockade
  of Mek1/ERK1/2 or STAT3 signaling abolished LIF-induced fibroblast proliferation
  and activation. NRK49F cells were pretreated with specific MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor
  U0126 (10 μM) or STAT3 inhibitor stattic (10 μM) for 30 min followed by incubation
  with LIF (6 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot
  analyses for c-Myc, Cyclin-D1, TNC, Fibronectin, and COL1A1. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01
  versus LIF alone (n = 4). (l) Real-time PCR analysis showed blockade of Mek1/ERK1/2
  or STAT3 signaling reduced LIF-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  in fibroblasts. NRK49F cells were pretreated with specific MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor
  U0126 (10 μM) or STAT3 inhibitor stattic (10 μM) for 30 min, followed by incubation
  with LIF or vehicle for 24 h. Relative mRNA levels are reported after normalization
  with GAPDH. #P < 0.05, ∗P < 0.01 versus LIF alone (n = 3). Data were expressed as
  means ± SD. P values were determined by Student''s t-test in (c) or one-way ANOVA
  (Least-Significant Difference test or Dunnett''s T3 test) in (a), (e), (g), (i),
  (k) and (l).'
