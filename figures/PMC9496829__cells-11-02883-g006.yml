caption: Common biological metabolic pathways were enriched by differential expressing
  metabolites identified from feces (A), urine (B) and serum (C). The common pathways
  enriched by different metabolites identified from feces, urine and/or serum were
  indicated using different symbols (◆, ◇, ★, ☆, ○, ◎ and/or ●). Red represents the
  significance of the pathway when it was enriched; the redder it is, the more significant
  (with a smaller p-value) the pathway is. Dot size represents the number of metabolites
  involved in the pathway; the bigger the dot is, the more metabolites are involved.
