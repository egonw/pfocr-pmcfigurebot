caption: 'Meta-analysis of CSF proteome changes. (A) Probability values (displayed
  as –log10P values) of individual CSF protein changes in the aged (18-mo-old) A30P-αS
  versus age-matched non-tg mice are plotted against those in aged APPPS1 versus age-matched
  non-tg mice for each analyte. These are the same mice as presented in  and . Note:
  positive values indicate an increase while negative values signify a decrease. Proteins
  with P < 0.05 (i.e., >1.3 on the –log10 scale) in both datasets reflect a general
  increase: that is, both mouse models showed an abundance difference between tg and
  non-tg animals at 18 mo of age (red sector), while P < 0.05 in either the A30P-αS
  (gray) or the APPPS1 (blue) dataset rather point at pathology-specific modulations.
  Note: Although LCN2 also appeared to be increased in both aged APPPS1 and A30P-αS
  mice, it escaped the APPPS1 analysis since it was quantified in less than three
  18-mo-old wild-type mice; dashed lines indicate the threshold of P = 0.05 (i.e.,
  not corrected for multiple hypothesis testing) (compare with  and ). Bold letters
  indicate the proteins that were significantly up-regulated in aged tg mice of both
  disease models after FDR correction. (B) Protein–protein interaction of CSF analytes
  changing in response to pathology in both mouse models (as displayed in A, red sector)
  revealed 7.5 times more interactions than would be predicted for a random set of
  proteins of comparable size (i.e., 60 vs. 8 edges, respectively; protein–protein
  interaction enrichment P < 1.0e-16). Line thickness corresponds to the strength
  of data support. Color code based on functional enrichment analysis: “immune system”
  (red; reactome pathway), “lysosome” and “axon” (blue and green, respectively; GO
  Cellular Components), “serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity” (yellow; GO
  Molecular Function), and “cholesterol metabolism” (cyan; KEGG pathway).'
