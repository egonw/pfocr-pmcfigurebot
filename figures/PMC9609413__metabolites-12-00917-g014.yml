caption: Topological analysis diagram of anion. The ordinate of metabolic topological
  analysis was -ln(P), and the value of P represents significance. The lower the value
  of P and the higher the value of -lnP, the more significant the enrichment of metabolites
  in this pathway. The abscissa impact was the path influence value. The greater the
  influence value of the pathway, the more likely the metabolites of the query were
  consistent with the metabolites of the pathway.
