figure_title: Molecular mechanisms associated with the neoantigen signature
caption: A Left panel, GSVA showing DDR pathways significantly enriched in high NEO2IS
  group (adjusted p value <0.05); right panel, the estimated proportion of POLE and
  MMR-related gene mutations in two subgroups according to median NEO2IS. B Proteomic
  analysis showing correlation between NEO2IS and the abundance of relevant proteins
  involving cell cycle and DDR pathways. C Left panel, tumor ploidy significantly
  related to the neoantigen signature; right panel, GSEA enrichment results (q-value
  <0.3) for immunomodulatory REACTOME pathways (top 10) that correlated with NEO2IS
  in external NSCLC samples. D Comparison of expression levels of genes associated
  with T-effector and INFÎ³ pathway, PDL1, pY705 STAT3 and STAT5 between high and low
  NEO2IS groups. E Potential immune evasion mechanisms associated with higher NEO2IS,
  including higher levels of co-inhibitory receptors, loss of heterozygosity of HLA
  gene locus (LOHHLA) and somatic mutations in HLA or B2M gene. F NEO2IS shows significant
  association with clinical features (left panel); differentially expressed genes
  between metastatic and primary tumors (right panel).
