caption: Summary of GH-related molecular mechanisms. GH is regulated by GHRH and SST.
  GH promotes EMT and induces WNT signaling pathway to promote the proliferation and
  invasion of breast cancer. In addition, GH also promotes lipolysis through ERK signaling
  pathways. GH, growth hormone; GHRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone; SST, somatostatin;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; SGA, small for gestational age; GHR, growth
  hormone receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PKC, protein kinase C; HSL,
  hormone-sensitive lipase.
