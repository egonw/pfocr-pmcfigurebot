caption: Immune filtration of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) gene.
  Spearman's correlations between the differentially expressed PCK1 gene and immune
  cell infiltration in (a) colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and (b) rectal adenocarcinoma
  (READ) patients. The TIMER web tool was used for the analysis of correlations between
  immune infiltration of the immune cell markers of B cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells,
  T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells vs. the PCK1 gene. Statistical
  significance was accepted at p < 0.05 for Spearman's correlations.
