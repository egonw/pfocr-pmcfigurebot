caption: 'Expression analysis of DEGs enriched in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.
  (A): DEGs enriched in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in C. vietnamensis leaves.
  (B): Heatmap of flavonoid biosynthesis-related gene expression. CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; CYP75B1, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase. Values are the average
  FPKM value of each sample in each group. Genes in red or blue refer to up- or downregulation
  responding to drought, respectively. (C). Total polyphenol content of drought-tolerant
  cultivar HD1 and drought-sensitive cultivar WH1. (D). Total flavonoid content of
  the drought-tolerant cultivar HD1 and drought-sensitive cultivar WH1. All data are
  shown as the mean standard error. Different capital letters represent significant
  differences between cultivars; different lowercase letters indicate significant
  differences between treatments (Duncan’s test; p < 0.05).'
