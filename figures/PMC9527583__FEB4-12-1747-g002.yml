caption: The EGFR‐TRAF4–ERK5 is a dominant pathway in human NSCLC. (A) RT‐PCR analysis
  from FFPE sections of human normal (n = 15) or NSCLC samples (n = 20). Gene expression
  is graphed as a relative fold in NSCLC over normal lung. Each dot represents an
  independent sample. (B) Densitometric quantification of the indicated proteins in
  lysates of human normal lung tissue (n = 15) or NSCLC (n = 20) as analyzed by western
  blot. (C) Linear regression of the indicated protein levels in NSCLC as detected
  by western blot. (D) Representative results of western blot analysis of normal human
  lung tissue or NSCLC samples. Each lane represents samples from an individual patient.
  (E) Freshly collected normal human lung tissue or NSCLC samples were lysed and subjected
  to immunoprecipitation with anti‐EGFR antibody, followed by western blot analysis.
  Each pair of lanes (IgG, IP) represents a sample from an individual patient. All
  the data are representative of three experiments.
