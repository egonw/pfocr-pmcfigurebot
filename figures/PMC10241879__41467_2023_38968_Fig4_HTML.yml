figure_title: Pitavastatin induces cell death through the inhibition of prenylation
  of Rabs and the disruption of integrin signal pathway
caption: a Volcano plot of proteomic data. Protein changes in parental (left) and
  chronic BRAF-inhibitor treated K029A cells (right) upon treatment with 1 µM pitavastatin
  for 24 h. p value (two side unpaired t test) plotted in a log10 scale, including
  fold-change in detected protein (pitavastatin vs DMSO) plotted in a log2 scale.
  Significance calculated as un-paired, two-sided t test. b Heatmap of the expression
  of cell cycle associated genes in K029A parental, chronic BRAF-inhibitor treated,
  chronic BRAF-inhibitor treated with ectopic expression of LacZ or dual Rabs, following
  treatment with/without 1 µM pitavastatin for 24 h. As indicated, one group of chronic
  BRAF-inhibitor treated K029A cells were added GGPP at 0.4 µg/ml. c Fractions of
  G0/G1, S and G2/M phase cells in K029A chronic treated BRAF-inhibitor adapted cells.
  Cells were treated with/without pitavastatin [1 µM for 24 h] (mean ± SEM, n = 3).
  Significance calculated as un-paired, two-sided t test. d Western blots of RAB6B
  and RAB27A. Total, membrane attached and soluble RAB6B and RAB27A in K029A chronic
  treated BRAF-inhibitor adapted cells with the ectopic expression of wild type dual
  RABs or prenylation-mutant dual RABs are indicated. Cells were treated with/without
  pitavastatin [1 µM for 24 h]. e Heatmap of changes in plasma membrane associated
  integrins within chronic treated BRAF-inhibitor treated K029A cells with ectopic
  expression of RAB6B and RAB27A (LacZ as a control). Cells were treated with/without
  pitavastatin [1 µM for 18 h]. f Western blot analyses of plasma membrane located
  integrin-α5 and integrin-β1 in parental K029A cells with/without PGC1α knockout
  and chronic BRAF-inhibitor treated K029A cells with ectopic expression of LacZ or
  combination of RAB6B and RAB27A. The cells were treated with pitavastatin [1 µM
  for 18 h]. g Western blots of FAK-pY397 in K029A parental cells with/without PGC1α
  knockout and chronic treated BRAF-inhibitor adapted cells with the ectopic expression
  of LacZ or RAB27A and RAB6B. The cells were treated with pitavastatin [1 µM for
  24 h]. h Crystal violet staining images. K029A (left) and A375P (right) parental,
  chronic BRAF-inhibitor adapted cells with ectopic expression of LacZ or combination
  RAB6B and RAB27A were pre-treated with pitavastatin for 18 h and then seeded into
  6-well plates. The unattached cells were washed away with PBS and the attached cells
  subsequently stained with crystal violet. i, j Percentages of viable cells in suspension.
  K029A (i) and A375P (j) parental, chronic BRAF-inhibitor adapted cells with ectopic
  expression of LacZ or RAB6B and RAB27A were suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose and
  treated with/without NAC or pitavastatin. Viable cells were assessed by staining
  negative for trypan blue (mean ± SEM, n = 3). Significance calculated as un-paired,
  two-sided t test. k A proposed schematic model depicts how chronic BRAF-inhibitor
  treatment causes downregulation of PPARGC1A with effects on RAB6B and RAB27A, which
  causes a collateral vulnerability towards HMGCR inhibitors (statins) by elevated
  dependence on RAB-mediated integrin trafficking.
