caption: 'The effects of C29, TAK242 on BRHE induced NO, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-α production.
  The RAW 264.7 cells (A) and peritoneal macrophages (B) were pre-treated with C29
  (TLR2 inhibitor), TAK242 (TLR4 inhibitor) for 30 min and then treated with BRHE
  (200 μg/mL) for 20 h. Representative pictures of Griss assay, ELISA, and quantitative
  analyses. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ## p
  < 0.01 versus control; ** p < 0.01 versus BRHE treatment alone.'
