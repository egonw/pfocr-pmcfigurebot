caption: 'The environmental drivers of BGC richness in agricultural soil microbiomes.
  (a) Latitudinal distribution of BGC richness. (b-e) The Spearman correlation of
  BGC richness with soil pH, soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual
  temperature, respectively. (f) structural equation modeling (SEM) of BGC richness
  and composition. Numbers near the pathway arrow indicate the standard path coefficients
  (β). The arrow width is proportional to the strength of the relationship. R2 represents
  the proportion of variance explained for every dependent variable. The goodness
  of fit was acceptable: Model χ2 = 11.5, df = 11, GFI = 0.986, CFI = 0.998; root
  mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.03.'
