caption: Mechanism of the ethylene signaling pathway in plants. Ethylene receptors
  ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1), ETR2, ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1), ERS2, and ETHYLENE
  INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4) are present on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In the
  absence of ethylene, ethylene receptors activate the CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1
  (CTR1) protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates the C-terminal end of EIN2
  (EIN2-CEND) and turns off EIN2â€™s function. In the cytosol, the m-RNA F-box proteins
  EBF1 and EBF2 (EBF1/2) are translated and target the transcription regulation of
  ethylene signaling. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 (EIN3/EIL1),
  functioning in the proteasome for protein turnover, is degraded in the nucleus,
  thus preventing ethylene responses. When ethylene is available, ethylene receptors
  no longer activate CTR1, dephosphorylate EIN2, and cleave, thus releasing EIN2-CEND,
  which functions in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, one fate of EIN2-CEND
  is to bind the RNAs for EBF1 and EBF2, become sequestered in processing bodies (P-bodies),
  and inhibit their translation. The other fate of EIN2-CEND is that it shuttles into
  the nucleus and directly or indirectly potentiates the activity of EIN3 and EIL1
  via EIN2 nuclear-associated protein 1 (ENAP1). In the nucleus, EIN3/EIL1 regulates
  the transcriptional cascade involving transcriptional factors.
