caption: Canonical pathways associated with the 67 DEPs. Their expression was significant
  (threshold of 1.3 corresponds to P value of 0.05) as identified by IPA. Among them,
  2 significant pathways were identified (black columns), namely atherosclerosis signaling
  for MMP3 and caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling for CAV1. DEPs, differentially
  expressed proteins; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis.
