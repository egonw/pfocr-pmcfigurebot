caption: YWHAG is associated with the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in cervical
  cancer. Metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway were detected in HeLa and C33A
  cells, including D-sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphate (a), deoxyribose-phosphate (b),
  fructose 1, 6-biphosphate (c), xylulose 5-phosphate (d), octulose-1, 8-biphosphate
  (e), and ribose-5-phosphate (f). (g) Glucose uptake capacity of HeLa and C33A cells.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
