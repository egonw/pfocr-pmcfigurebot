caption: The effects of GDF11 on PC12 cell when ALK5 or PI3K were inhibited. (A) Proliferation
  of PC12 cells treated with GDF11 (100 ng/mL), SB431542 (20 μM) or LY294002 (1 μM)
  was assessed by RTCA. (B) SB431542 (20 μM) or LY294002 (1 μM) inhibited GDF11-induced
  suppression of migration. (C) Quantitative analysis of (B). (D,E) were the transcriptional
  levels of nestin, βIII-tubulin, GFAP, cyclin D2 and cyclin B1, respectively. * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
