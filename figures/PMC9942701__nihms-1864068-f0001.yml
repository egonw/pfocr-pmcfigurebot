caption: 'Urinary SDMA is MYC-dependently increased in HCC. (A) Representative liver
  images and hematoxylin and eosin staining of liver sections from DEN-treated Mycfl/fl
  and MycΔHep,ERT2 mice (left) and quantification of surface tumor number (right).
  Scale bar, 100 μm. n = 16–23/group. (B) Partial least squares discriminant analysis
  (PLS-DA) analysis of the creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites from DEN-treated
  Mycfl/fl and MycΔHep,ERT2 mice. n = 8/group. (C) Heat map of the differential metabolites
  (variable importance in projection [VIP] score >1; P value < 0.05) (left). The top
  20 KEGG pathway enrichments (middle). VIP scores of top 20 identified metabolites
  from PLS-DA (right). (D) Quantitation of DMA, SDMA, and ADMA in urine. n = 8/group.
  (E) Time course of SDMA in urine. n = 8/group. (F) Quantitation of ADMA and SDMA
  in the urine from patients with HCC (n = 196) and healthy controls (n = 176) and
  correlation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) with urinary SDMA assessed by nonparametric
  Spearman’s test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Abbreviations: FDR, false
  discovery rate; ns, not significant; tRNA, transfer RNA.'
