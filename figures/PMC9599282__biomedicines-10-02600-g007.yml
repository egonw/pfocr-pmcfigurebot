caption: A schematic diagram of general pathway that may be important in the control
  of eye growth and how citicoline effects the scleral tissue. The first stage of
  growth signal cascades requires the linking of photoreceptors and dopaminergic amacrine
  cells inside the inner retina. Reduced stimulation of photoreceptors in LIM model
  decreases input to the dopaminergic amacrine cells []. The release of neurotransmitters
  by the retinal amacrine cells will convey a signal to the choroid and to the sclera
  [,,]. The process of scleral remodeling is the final stage of adaptation of the
  sclera to an eye with myopia. The cytokine TGF-β plays an important role in regulating
  changes in the extracellular matrix of the sclera. A low TGF-β concentration results
  in decreased collagen and proteoglycan synthesis, thereby weakening the scleral
  extracellular matrix’s biomechanical properties. This causes the expression of α
  smooth muscle actin on fibroblasts, thus causing differentiation of fibroblasts
  into myofibroblasts []. The balance of MMP-2 expression seems to have important
  roles in the metabolism of extracellular matrix in the sclera [,]. Under LIM conditions,
  there was an increase in free proenzyme MMP-2 activated along with a decrease in
  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase levels (TIMP). Increased MMP-2 mRNA and decreased
  TIMP-2 mRNA levels in posterior sclera led to ocular elongation [,]. The administration
  of CDP-choline as a dopamine receptor agonist is expected to decrease fibroblast
  growth factor and inhibit MMP-2 activity such that there is a decrease in the number
  of scleral fibroblasts and a reduction in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.
  From these conditions, it is expected that there will be an improvement in the thickness
  of the scleral tissue, increased glycosaminoglycan and collagen levels, the induction
  of the regularity of fibrils, and an increase in the diameter of fibrils in the
  sclera [,,,].
