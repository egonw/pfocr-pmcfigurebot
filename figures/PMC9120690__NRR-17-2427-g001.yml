caption: 'The XBP1s/HBP/O-GlcNAc axis.Activated IRE1 splices Xbp1 mRNA, which is then
  translated into XBP1s protein. XBP1s, a transcriptional factor, can upregulate the
  expression of HBP enzymes, including GFAT (*, the rate-limiting enzyme of HBP).
  The HBP produces UDP-GlcNAc, which is the sugar donor for O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational
  modification. Glucosamine and thiamet-G have been used to pharmacologically increase
  O-GlcNAcylation. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; GFAT: glutamine fructose-6-phosphate
  aminotransferase; GNK: GlcNAc kinase; GNPNAT1: glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  1; HBP: hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1; OGA:
  O-GlcNAcase; OGT: O-GlcNAc transferase; PGM3: phosphoglucomutase 3; UDP-GlcNAc:
  uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.'
