caption: Contribution of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in psoriasis. (a) Total protein
  (20 μg) from the epidermal fraction of HS+T, PS+T, PS+T+RSK inhibitor and PS+T+IL-17A
  mAb was loaded on a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE gel. The expression of p-ERK1/2 and total
  ERK1/2 (ERK1/2) was monitored by Western blot analysis. β-actin is shown as a loading
  control. (b) Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots (three donors (HS+T and PS+T)
  and two donors (PS+T+RSK inhibitor and PS+T+IL-17A mAb), two skin substitutes per
  donor). HS+T, healthy skin substitutes with T cells; PS+T, psoriatic skin substitutes
  with T cells; PS+T+RSK inhibitor, psoriatic skin substitutes with T cells treated
  with a RSK inhibitor; PS+T+IL-17A mAb, psoriatic skin substitutes with T cells treated
  with an IL-17A-neutralizing antibody.
