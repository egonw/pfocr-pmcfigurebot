figure_title: Phosphoproteomic analyses of molecules downstream of TOPK
caption: A Systematic workflow of the TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteome experiments
  (left panel). A total of 5091 phosphosites in 2450 proteins were identified and
  quantified (right panel). B The downregulated signaling pathways in shTOPK H2228
  cells. C A list of selected phosphoproteins regulated by TOPK were shown. D The
  expression levels of p-JNK (T183/Y185) and p-ATF2 (T71) in the shTOPK H2228 cells
  were analyzed by western blotting. Data are representative of results from triplicate
  experiments.
