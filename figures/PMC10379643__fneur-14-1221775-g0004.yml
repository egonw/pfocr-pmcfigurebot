caption: Proteins in AD vs. control associated with the top altered pathway, glycolysis
  inhibition. The glycolysis signaling pathway was the most significantly altered
  and was the most affected by the fold change of proteins in AD vs. control (p =
  1.00 x 10−12, z = −3.46). (A–L) The proteins are depicted by order of decreasing
  significance. Those proteins that are significant at 5% FDR are indicated for all
  pairwise comparisons, with the p-values as indicated. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01.
  Error bars indicate SEM.
