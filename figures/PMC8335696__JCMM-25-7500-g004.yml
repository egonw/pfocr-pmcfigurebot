caption: MAPK signalling pathway influenced by dapagliflozin. The red nodes represent
  the key targets, the yellow nodes represent common targets of dapagliflozin, T2DM
  and CVD targets, and the blue nodes represent the other targets of this pathway.
  Dapagliflozin mainly affects the classical MAPK signalling pathway and p38/MAPK
  signalling pathway. As for the classical MAPK signalling pathway, dapagliflozin
  acts on EGFR and PDGFR on the cell membrane, affecting the activation of GRB2, SOS,
  Ras, Raf, MAP2K1 and phosphorylation of MAPK1 and MAPK3 and finally causing changes
  in angiogenesis, cell apoptosis and cell proliferation. In the p38/MAPK signalling
  pathway, dapagliflozin acts on MAPK14, and when MAPK14 enters the nucleus, it affects
  the transcription and then regulates cell survival, proliferation, differentiation
  and other processes
