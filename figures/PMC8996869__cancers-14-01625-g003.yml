caption: KEGG and Gene Ontology (DIANA-mirPath) and dbEMT database analyses indicate
  modulations of EMT and metastasis-regulated genes by miRNAs in Akt1-deficient PC3
  and DU145 cells. (A,B) Volcano plot showing highly modulated, EMT regulating miRNAs
  in Akt1-deficient PC3 and DU145 cells compared to Akt1 intact controls. (C,D) Chart
  showing predicted and known targets of the identified miRNAs from NanoString analysis
  of Akt1-deficient PC3 and DU145 cells indicating their predominant involvement in
  the regulation of EMT and metastasis. Only changes in the miRNA that are statistically
  significant (p < 0.05) are shown (n = 3).
