caption: CBP promotes osteoblastic differentiation through the p38-MAPK mediation
  of the RUNX2 pathway. (A) CBP treatment (0.7, 7, 70 μM) for 24 h raises the expression
  of RUNX2. (B) Effect of MAPK inhibitor (SB203580, SP600125, and U0126) (+) and culture
  medium (−) on CBP treatment (70 μM) for 24 h increases ALP activity in MC3T3-E1.
  (C) Effect of p38 pathway inhibitor (SB203580) (+) and culture medium (−) on CBP
  treatment (70 μM) for 24 h raises OCN concentration in MC3T3-E1. (D) Phosphorylation
  level of p38 signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells cultured to 70 μM CBP and with
  (+)TβRI inhibitor (SB431542) or without (−)TβRI inhibitor (SB431542) for 3 h. n
  = 3. Data are expressed as mean ± SE. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, ns, not significant.
