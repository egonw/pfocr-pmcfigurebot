caption: p53 is the relay baton connecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and PREP.
  (a) Western blotting for the protein levels of p53 in human NP tissues. (b) The
  qRT-PCR measured the mRNA expression of p53 and PREP in human NP tissues. n = 28.
  (c) Western blotting for the protein level of PREP in NP cells with p53 overexpression.
  (d) Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis in NP cells, n = 3. (e) Schematic illustration
  of p53 binding sequence and the promotor region of PREP in human. P53 could bind
  to sites in the PREP promotor proved by CHIP assay. (f) Mutations in the putative
  p53-binding site of the PREP promotor region. (g) The mutant in binding site decreased
  luciferase activity in NP cells. Results are shown as mean ± SD, n = 5, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
