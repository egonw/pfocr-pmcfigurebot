caption: Upregulation of sulfotransferase family 2A member 1 (SULT2A1) suppresses
  the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) phenotype in vivo, leading to the inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  metastasis. (A, B) SULT2A1‐overexpressed HCC‐LM3 cells and the control group treated
  with 27‐OHC or not were used to establish orthotopic xenograft models. Representative
  H&E staining images of lung tissues (A) and the average numbers of lung metastatic
  lesions (B) from six mice per group are shown. Arrows refer to lung metastatic lesions.
  (C–F) Levels of EMT markers (C, D) and p65 and Twist1 (E, F) from SULT2A1‐overexpressed
  HCC tissues and the control group were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Representative
  images of IHC staining from six mice per group and the IHC H scores are shown. (G,
  H) shSULT2A1 Huh7 cells and the shNT group treated with 27‐OHC or Bay11‐7082 were
  used to establish orthotopic xenograft models. Representative H&E staining images
  of lung tissues (G) and the average numbers of lung metastatic lesions (H) from
  six mice per group are shown. Arrows refer to lung metastatic lesions. (I, J) Levels
  of EMT markers and p65 and Twist1 from shSULT2A1 HCC tissues and the shNT group
  were analyzed by IHC. Representative images of IHC staining from six mice per group
  (I) and the IHC H scores (J) are shown. Scale bar, 100 μm (A, C, E, G, I). Significance
  was determined by Student’s t‐test (B, D, F, H, J). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

  in HCC tissues based on the IHC H score. The correlation was then analyzed by Pearson
  correlation analysis. ***p < 0.001. shNT, shRNA non‐target
