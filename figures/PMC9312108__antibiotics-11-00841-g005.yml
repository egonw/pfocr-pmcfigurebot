caption: Prediction of protein-protein interaction networks of lysine acetylation
  and succinylation proteins in E. tarda. There were five highly metabolic pathways
  of PTM proteins were enriched in the global PPI network, such as, (A) ribosome,
  (B) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, (C) oxidative phosphorylation, (D) RNA degradation,
  (E) pentose phosphate pathway. Different colors display different modifications;
  the pink and red cycles represent the proportions of Kac and Ksu modifications in
  single proteins, respectively.
