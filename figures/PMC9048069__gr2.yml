caption: RNA-seq validation of the top upregulated genes in EGFR mutants(A) Schematic
  showing the steps of RNA-seq for identifying commonly upregulated genes in NIH3T3
  cells expressing the indicated EGFR mutants.(B) RNA-seq was performed using NIH3T3
  cells expressing either empty vector EGFR-WT or EGFR mutants L858R, L861Q, or DEL1.
  The heatmap showing the top upregulated genes whose expression was upregulated 15-fold
  or more in all mutants compared to the empty vector control.(C) NIH3T3 cells expressing
  vector, wild-type EGFR or the indicated EGFR mutant were analyzed by RT-qPCR for
  expression of the indicated genes. Gene expression is plotted relative to the empty
  vector control. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, ns = not-significant, ∗p<0.05,
  ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001. See also  and , , , , , , and .
