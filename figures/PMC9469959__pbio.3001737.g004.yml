caption: (a) Western blot analysis of WT and Vim −/− MEFs starved with RPMI media
  lacking amino acids, glucose, and growth factors for 1 hour, followed by a 30-minute
  stimulation with 1 mM L-glutamine plus 1× EAAs alone or with NEAAs, plus 2.5 mM
  glucose and 100 nM insulin (n = 3). (b) Same experiment as in (a) performed without
  insulin. (c) Representative images of WT and Vim −/− MEFs serum starved overnight
  and stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 15 minutes. The cells were stained for mTOR
  and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (scale bar = 20 μm). (d) The colocalization analysis
  is represented as mean ± SEM of the percentage of colocalized pixels before and
  after insulin stimulation and it was performed using BioImageXD (n = 3). (e) Same
  as in (d) but in steady-state conditions. *p < 0.05, ns = nonsignificant. The data
  underlying the graphs shown in Fig 4D and 4E can be found in . SFM, serum-free media;
  EAAs, essential amino acids; NEAAs, Non essential amino acids; mTORC1, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin kinase complex 1.
