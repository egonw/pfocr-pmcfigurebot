caption: UBA3-dependent neddylation pathway has effect on the transcriptional activation
  of tumor-related cytokines mediated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. A MLN4924 treatment
  led to the accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα. Protein expression of Cullin1, p-IκBα,
  IκBα and β-actin in A549 cell lysates were detected by Western blot. B The level
  of expression of certain tumor-related cytokines was decreased in MLN4924-treated
  A549 groups. Relative mRNA levels of expression of CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, CSF2, IL-6,
  and IL-1B were evaluated by real-time PCR. β-actin was used as an internal reference.
