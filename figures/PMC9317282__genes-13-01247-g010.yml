caption: Hypothetical schematic model showing the MAPK pathway and ABA-independent
  pathway in WT and M3 plants. (A) Hypothetical schematic model of MAPK pathway during
  short-term (CK vs. 2 h) low-temperature stress. (B) Hypothetical schematic model
  of ABA-independent pathway during long-term (CK vs. 12 h) low-temperature stress.
  An MAPK pathway and ABA-independent pathway model was developed based on the KO
  enrichment pathway Map04016 and Map04075, respectively. Unique DEGs are shown by
  heatmap. The red and green color indicated up-regulated and down-regulated expression
  pattern of genes in heatmap. Blue lines with arrows denote certain regulation, and
  blue dotted lines with arrows denote uncertain regulation.
