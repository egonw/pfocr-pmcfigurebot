caption: Mechanisms of action of triptolide in neurological diseases. The mechanisms
  of action of triptolide in neurological diseases involves neuroinflammation, neurotrophic
  effects, and other neuroprotective effects. It attenuates neuroinflammation and
  regulate inflammation levels in microglia and neuron, as evidenced by increased
  expression of anti-inflammatory factors and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory
  factors. Signaling pathways such as NF-kB are involved in this regulation. In addition,
  current studies have reported neurotrophic effects of triptolide for neurological
  diseases. Triptolide increases the expression levels of NGF, synaptophysin, neuroligin-1,
  and BDNF mRNA, and it also inhibits astrogliosis and excessive glial scar, which
  is associated with the regulation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore,
  triptolide can act directly on neurons and thus exert neuroprotective effects by
  affecting other signaling pathways such as autophagy and apoptosis.
