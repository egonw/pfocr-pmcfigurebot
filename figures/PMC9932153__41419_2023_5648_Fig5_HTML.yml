figure_title: ASAP1 mediates cytoskeleton assembly by regulating CDC42 expression
  in GC cells
caption: A The RNA-seq of ASAP1-depletedGC cell and a volcano plot showing the differential
  genes. B KEGG pathway analysis showing enrichment of differential gene. C The whole
  cell lysates were extracted from SGC-7901 cells expressing ASAP1-HA or from ASAP1+/−
  SG-7901 cells to measure CDC42, RAC1, RALA and RhoA GTPase activity by G-LISA activation
  assay. D The whole cell lysates prepared from either SGC-7901 or MGC803 cell expressing
  ASAP1-HA were used for CDC42 activation assay followed by western blotting. E Combined
  phalloidin staining for F-actin (red) and ASAP1 (green) immunofluorescence. Nuclei
  were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In ASAP1+/− SGC-7901 cells, the filamentous
  pseudopodia disappeared and cytoskeleton depolymerized. F SGC-7901 cells were treated
  with CDC42 inhibitor ZCL278 and combined phalloidin staining for F-actin (red).
  The filamentous pseudopodia disappeared and cytoskeleton depolymerized. G SGC-7901
  cells were treated with CDC42 inhibitor ZCL278 and the whole cell lysates were extracted
  to measure CDC42 GTPase activity by G-LISA activation assay. H The proliferation
  of SGC-7901 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, SGC-7901 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-ASAP1-HA,
  SGC-7901 cells treated with ZCL278 or SGC-7901 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-ASAP1-HA
  followed by treated with ZCL278 was determined by CCK-8. I The migration of various
  types of cells described in H was determined by Transwell assays.
