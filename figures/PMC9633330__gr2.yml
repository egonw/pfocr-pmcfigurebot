caption: Comparison of Treg-cell transcriptomic profiles between young post-pubertal
  cisgender men and womenFACS-sorted Treg cells (CD4+CD25+CD127–) from five young,
  post-pubertal cisgender men and five young, post-pubertal cisgender women were analysed
  by RNA-sequencing and whole genome expression was compared by sex. (A) Volcano plot
  displaying log2 fold changes and log10 p values of DEGs between cisgender men and
  women, where coloured points represent statistically significant DEGs below p value
  threshold of 0·01). (B) Hierarchical clustering heatmap (Clustvis, Pearson's) of
  normalised gene counts of statistically significantly altered DEGs between cisgender
  men and women. (C) Pathway analysis plot displaying the –log10 p values of enriched
  DEG pathway ontology terms of Treg cells between cisgender men and women using the
  82 statistically significant DEGs. (D) Pathway analysis plot displaying the p value
  and enrichment ratios of enriched DEG pathway ontology terms of Treg cells between
  cisgender men and women using the extended gene list, incorporating both original
  seed genes and the genes from respective protein–protein interaction networks; the
  size of the points are relative to the number of genes contributing to that pathway.
  Box and whisker plots displaying Treg-cell gene expression by normalised counts
  of genes associated with the PI3K–AKT signalling (E), altered translation initiation
  pathways (F), and FOXP3 expression (G); data are mean (SE). DEG=differentially expressed
  gene. ER=oestrogen receptor alpha. Treg=regulatory T. Tresp=responder T.
