figure_title: GCN5 expression is upregulated in hypertrophic mouse hearts and cardiomyocytes
caption: A–D EF values, FS values, HW/BW ratios, and HW/TL ratios in mice subjected
  to sham or TAC surgery at 2 or 4 weeks. E ANP, β-MHC, and GCN5 mRNA levels in the
  hearts of mice subjected to sham or TAC surgery. F ANP, β-MHC, and GCN5 protein
  levels in the hearts of mice subjected to sham or TAC surgery. (n = 4 mice/group,
  ∗P < 0.05 vs SHAM, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs SHAM) (G) ANP, β-MHC, and GCN5 mRNA levels in NRCMs
  treated with PBS or PE (50 μM). H ANP, β-MHC, and GCN5 protein levels in NRCMs treated
  with PBS or PE (∗∗P < 0.01 vs PBS). Data are shown as the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments.
