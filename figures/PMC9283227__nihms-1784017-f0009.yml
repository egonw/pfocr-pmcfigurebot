figure_title: Figure 4.Effects of JAK1 pathway inhibitor on Cytomix treated 3D organotypic
  skin culture
caption: A. Staining of fully differentiated 3D skin equivalents untreated (Control),
  low concentration (1 ng/mL) Cytomix and Cytomix + JAK1 pathway inhibitor (ABT-317)
  respectively. Top row represents H&E staining followed by IHC staining of S100A7
  (middle) and loricrin (bottom). Representative images at 32X magnification are shown
  (bar = 100μm). B. Differences between RNA transcript levels in treated and non-treated
  3D skin equivalents were quantified for each probe using qRT-PCR. Average of 4 samples
  is shown ± S.E.M. Data is presented as fold change over control (untreated) whose
  value was fixed at 1 (dashed line). (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001
  using ratio paired t-test of Cytomix vs. Cytomix + ABT-317). C. Differences between
  secreted IL-6 and IL-8 proteins in control and treated 3D skin equivalents were
  quantified using immunoassays. Average of at least 5 treated samples is shown ±
  S.E.M. (**p<0.01, ****p<0.0001 using ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test vs. Cytomix)
