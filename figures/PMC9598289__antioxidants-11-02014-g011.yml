caption: The MAPK pathway participates in the cytoprotective role of 9r. (A) Western
  blot examination of MAPK proteins, including p-ERK, p-P38 and p-JNK. (Bâ€“D) Relative
  intensities of p-ERK, p-P38 and p-JNK. The data are provided as the mean and standard
  deviation of three separate experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.01 when compared
  to the corresponding control. &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01 and &&&p < 0.001 compared to
  the H2O2-treated group.
