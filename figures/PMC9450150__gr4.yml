caption: Ligand-induced, GPR35-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G protein biosensors.
  Concentration response curves of pamoic acid, kynurenic acid, and zaprinast obtained
  using BRET-based biosensors of Gi1 (A–C), Gi2 (D–F), Gi3 (G–I), Go1 (J–L), Gz (M–O),
  Gq (P–R), G15 (S–U), Gs (V–X), G12 (y–aa), and G13 (ab–ad). Data show mean ± s.e.m.
  of three to four independent experiments conducted in transiently transfected HEK293A cells.
  Vehicle-treated ΔBRET values were set to 0. BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy
  transfer; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293A.
article_title: Isoforms of GPR35 have distinct extracellular N-termini that allosterically
  modify receptor-transducer coupling and mediate intracellular pathway bias.
