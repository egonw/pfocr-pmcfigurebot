caption: CellChat inference of signaling pathways among BLM + ADSCs group. (a) UMAP
  distribution of coarsely annotated cell type of both lung-originated cells and with
  recollected ADSCs (ADSC_rec) in BLM + ADSCs group. (b) Stacked violin plot of Ptprpc
  (CD45), CD68, and Egfp expression in BLM + ADSCs group. (c, d) Signaling pathway
  network in BLM + ADSC group calculated by CellChat. showing signaling between recollected
  ADSCs (ADSC_rec) and lung-originated cells. (c) Sender, receiver, mediator, and
  influencer of different pathways. (d) Relative contribution of each ligand-receptor
  pair in corresponding pathway network.
