caption: RNASeq and protein analysis of PP2A and downstream target proteins in CRC
  cells(A and B) RNASeq analysis of FOLFOX-HT29 cells. Cells were treated with 20 μM
  of NSC49L and 1 nM of TRAIL either alone or in combination for 16 h. Total RNA was
  isolated by TRIzol reagent and processed for RNASeq analysis. Ward clustering algorithm
  with Euclidean distance measurement was used for heat map analysis.(C) Correlation
  of PP2A expression level with AKT1(S473P) and p21 levels in CRC cell lines. To determine
  a correlation of PP2A with AKT1(S473P) and p21, we performed Western bots of these
  proteins using the whole-cell lysate of different CRC cell lines, including FOLFOX-resistant
  HCT116 and HT29 cells.(D and E) Protein levels of AKT1, p53, p21, DR5, caspase 3,
  caspase 8, and PARP1 in HCT116, FOLFOX-CHT116, HT29, and FOLFOX-HT29 cell lines,
  respectively, treated with NSC49L and TRAIL either alone or in combination for 24
  h. The blots are representative of three experiments. See also  and .
