caption: QN523 induces stress responses in MIA PaCa-2 cells. (A) Top 20 canonical
  pathways regulated by QN523 as revealed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Histogram
  represents percentage of genes regulated in the pathway; numbers on the histogram
  are total numbers of genes in the specific pathway. Red bars denote up-regulated
  genes, and green bars denote down-regulated genes. Orange line represents statistical
  significance in regulation of the indicated pathway. (B) QN523 induces apoptosis
  and stress responses in MIA PaCa-2 cells as revealed by DAVID analysis. Top 5 biological
  themes in genes upregulated by QN523 treatment. (C) Top 5 biological themes in genes
  downregulated by QN523 treatment. Histogram represents statistical significance
  in regulation of the indicated theme.
