caption: Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites between CK group
  and GM group (A) or CK group and GI group (B). The x-axis (−log10 (p-value)) represents
  the pathway enrichment score and the y-axis represents the pathway impact score.
  Pathway impact score is proportional to the bubble size. The significance level
  of the pathways is denoted by the bubble color, ranging from highest (red) to lowest
  (white).
