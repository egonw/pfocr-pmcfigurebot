caption: 'Schematic representation of RAS isoforms with the indication of the main
  PTMs. In humans, three RAS genes encode four distinct proteoforms: HRAS, NRAS, and
  the two splice variants of KRAS, KRAS4A, and KRAS4B. The two-thirds at the N terminus
  of RAS proteins consists of a conserved G-domain (aa 1–165) sharing a high percentage
  of identity. At the C terminus third, corresponding to the hypervariable region
  (HVR, aa 166–188, and aa 166–189 for KRAS4B being one aa longer), the proteins undergo
  a CAAX processing reaction cleavage at the CAAX consensus domain and palmitoylation
  cycles to direct the membrane trafficking and localization of different entities
  to drive specific pathway execution. The principal PTMs, including palmitoylation,
  phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation are reported
  and labeled as in the figure legends and occur along the whole sequence. The modified
  aa are highlighted. Due to its critical role in cancer, KRAS4B is better characterized
  in PTMs.'
