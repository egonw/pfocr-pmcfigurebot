caption: 'Small arterioles in the brain were labeled, stained, and quantitative analysis.
  Capital letters A–E are pathological staining of the brain of WT mice, respectively:
  CD31, CD34, CD68, Ki‐67, and p53. Lowercase letters a–e represent the staining corresponding
  to the Mut group, respectively. f is the optical density quantitative analysis of
