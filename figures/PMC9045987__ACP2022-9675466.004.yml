caption: Overexpression of SIX4 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote
  CC cell growth and chemoresistance to DDP. (a) Detection of SIX4 mRNA expression
  in HT-3/DDP and HeLa/DDP cells by RT-qPCR. (b) The proliferation of cells measured
  using colony formation assay. (c) The cell viability measured using EdU assay. (d)
  The invasive ability of cells determined using Transwell assay. (e) The chemoresistance
  of cells to DDP measured using MTT assay. (f) The protein expression of p-PI3K,
  PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT in cells examined using Western blot. Data among multiple groups
  were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p
  < 0.01). The cell experiment was independently repeated three times.
