caption: TNF-α induces adhesion proteins in human RASFs via the PKCδ (JNK and NF-κB)
  signaling pathway. Knockdown of Sulf-2 inhibits the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation
  of PKCδ and JNK. A Human RASFs were preincubated for 2 h with a panel of signaling
  inhibitors, followed by stimulation with TNF-α for 24 h. Western blots were probed
  for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, cadherin-11 and podoplanin. Inhibitors of NF-κB, JNK and, most
  prominently, PKCδ led to significant reductions in TNF-α-induced adhesion proteins,
  revealing the importance of these pathways. B The central role of PKCδ was confirmed
  by the dose-dependent decrease in ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and cadherin-11 levels in RASFs
  after treatment with the PKCδI-specific small-molecule inhibitor NP627
