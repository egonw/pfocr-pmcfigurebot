caption: Correlation between the SMO mutation status and signaling pathways. (A) Gene
  set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of Gene Ontology biological process (GO-BP), Hallmark,
  and Reactome gene sets downloaded from MSigDB. In each panel, the gene sets marked
  on the left were enriched in the SMO mutant (SMO_MUT) group, while the pathways
  marked on the right were enriched in the SMO wild-type (SMO_WT) group. Each run
  was performed with 1,000 permutations. (B, C) Differences in pathway activities
  scored using GSEA (B) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) (C) between the SMO_MUT
  and SMO_WT tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Enrichment results with
  significant associations between the SMO_MUT and SMO_WT tumors are shown. In (B),
  the blue bar indicates that the enrichment score (ES) of the pathway is more than
  0, while the yellow bar indicates that the ES of the pathway is less than 0.
