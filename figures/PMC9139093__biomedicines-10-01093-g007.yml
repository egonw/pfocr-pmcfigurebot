caption: 'IFNγ-treated macrophages activate the EMT (Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition)
  process in colonic epithelial cells and the WNT pathway. HT29 cells were co-cultured
  for 3 days with U937 cells pre-treated with IFNγ, IL1β, IL4, IL10 or vehicle for
  4 days: (a) Graphs show the mRNA expression of fibrosis markers (n ≥ 5 per experimental
  group); (b) Graphs show the protein expression of EMT markers and WNT pathway components.
  Images correspond to a representative Western blot (n ≥ 4 per experimental group).
  Representative images showing nuclear staining (Hoechst) and VIMENTIN (Tex Red)
  in HT29 cells treated with vehicle or IFNγ-U937 for 3 days (scale bar 100 μm). In
  all cases, the bars in the graphs represent mean ± SEM, and significant differences
  vs. HT29-vehicle cells are shown by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 or *** p < 0.01 and
  vs. HT29-U937/IFNγ-treated U937 cells are shown by # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 or ###
  p < 0.001.'
