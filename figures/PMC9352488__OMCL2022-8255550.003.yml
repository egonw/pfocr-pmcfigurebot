caption: Regulatory relationship of 6 key clusters and their effects on infiltrating
  immune cells. (a) The key subnetworks in the PPI network were screened based on
  the MCODE algorithm. (b) KEGG pathways of five key subnetworks (MCODE 1-5). The
  triangle green represents the pathway, the circle is the disease-related gene, and
  the diamond is the marker gene of the differential subgroup, and the genes in the
  same red dotted line belong to the same MCODE. (c) Pearson correlation analysis
  between each gene within the five key subnetworks and 22 immune cells. Red indicates
  positive correlation, and blue indicates negative correlation. ∗P < 0.05,  ∗∗P <
  0.01, and∗∗∗P < 0.001.
