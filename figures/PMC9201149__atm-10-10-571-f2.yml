caption: 'Effect of miR-145-5p on thrombin-treated hBMECs. (A) Representative images
  showing changes in the capillary-like structure of hBMECs observed by Matrigel tube
  formation assay under different conditions (200× magnification, scale bar: 50 µm).
  (B) Distribution and expression of tight junction-related proteins were detected
  by immunofluorescence assay (400× magnification, scale bar: 50 µm). (C) After FITC-dextran
  was added, fluorescence intensity (AU) over time were quantified as a reflection
  of alterations in vascular permeability. Results are presented as mean ± SD and
  *, P<0.05; ***, P<0.001. hBMECs, human brain microvascular endothelial cells; HICH,
  hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; NC, negative
  control; AU, arbitrary unit.'
article_title: miR-145-5p targets MMP2 to protect brain injury in hypertensive intracerebral
  hemorrhage via inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
