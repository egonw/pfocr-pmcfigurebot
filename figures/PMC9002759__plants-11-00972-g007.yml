caption: 'Sunflower WRI1 target genes in the seed plastidial fatty acid biosynthetic
  pathway. WRI1 regulation of the sunflower gene isoforms studied here in EMSAs and
  the resulting active consensus sunflower AW box motif can be used to summarize the
  coordinated co-regulation of the pathway by WRI1: blue background, WRI1–EMSA positive;
  red background, WRI1–EMSA negative; blue outline, WRI1–EMSA smear, probably positive;
  dashed-red outline, WRI1–EMSA smear, probably negative; solid red outline, AW box
  motif outside the 5′–UTR and predicted not to be bound by WRI1; orange background,
  absence of a WRI1 AW box motif; black outline, AW box motif not present in the CAS−6
  line according to the Heliagene database.'
