caption: KIC-compounds are selective inhibitors of both IRAK4 and PIM1 kinases. (A,
  B) Chemical structures of KIC-compounds and a comparative drug, PF-06650833. (C)
  IRAK4 and PIM1 kinase activity in the indicated condition of KIC-compounds and ATP.
  (D–G) Predicted binding poses of KIC-0096 (green), KIC-0099 (blue) and KIC-0101
  (magenta) in IRAK4 (D, E) and PIM1 (F, G) kinase. Major residues are exhibited in
  thin sticks and obstructing flap regions are omitted for clarity. (H) Correlation
  plot of Prime MM-GBSA scores and experimental activity of the IRAK4 (blue) and PIM1
  (orange) kinase.
