caption: Tentative biodegradation pathway for poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) in aerobic
  conditions. PHB is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular enzymes, namely PHA,
  PHB depolymerases to β-hydroxybutyrate. β-hydroxybutyrate is metabolized via β-oxidation
  to acetyl-CoA units, which is later metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle to produce energy and releasing CO2 and water.
