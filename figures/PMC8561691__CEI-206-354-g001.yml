caption: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was involved in
  altered rheumatoid arthritis (RA) peripheral B cell homeostasis and functions. (A)
  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patients and healthy
  controls (HC), and the levels of phosphorylated (p)‐mTOR (a), p‐P70S6K (b) and p‐4E‐BP1
  (c) on CD19+ B cells were analyzed with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). (B–D) RA CD19+
  B cells were sorted with magnetic beads and stimulated with or without rapamycin
  in the presence of anti‐CD40/CpG for 72 h, and the frequencies of CD19+CD27+CD24highregulatory
  B cells (B), CD19+CD27+CD38high plasmablasts (C) and CD19+CD138+ plasma cells (D)
  were determined with flow cytometry assay (n = 5). (E,F) RA CD19+ B cells were stimulated
  for 72 h; the supernatants were collected and the levels of IgM, IgG, IL‐6 and IL‐10
  were measured with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (n = 5). (G)
  RA CD19+ B cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
  (CFSE) and cultured for 5 days, and B cell proliferation was analyzed with flow
  cytometry assay (n = 5). (H) The expression of CD80 and CD86 on B cells was quantified
  with flow cytometry assay at 72 h (n = 5). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
