caption: 'Effect of Sal B or TAK-242 in ROS generation and the levels of ΔΨm. (a)
  The green fluorescence in iopromide-treated cells was higher than that in control
  cells. However, Sal B or TAK-242 could reduce the fluorescence intensity. (b, c)
  Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. control group; ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group. (d) The green fluorescence
  in iopromide-treated cells was lower than that in control cells. Sal B or TAK-242
  treatment increased the fluorescence intensity. (e, f) Similar results were obtained
  by flow cytometry. n = 6. Data are the mean ± SD. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group;
  ##P < 0.01 vs. iopromide group.'
