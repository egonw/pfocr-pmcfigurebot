caption: Gross skin appearance (A) and skin texture grade of mice (B); activities
  of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the skin of nude mice
  (C). Data expressed as mean ± SD. Data are mean values ± SD. Different symbols (a,
  ab, b, c, cd and d) indicate significant difference among groups (Fisher's least
  significant difference, p < 0.05), and the values decrease with the order from a
  to d. We repeated the experiments three times to ensure the accuracy of the experiments
