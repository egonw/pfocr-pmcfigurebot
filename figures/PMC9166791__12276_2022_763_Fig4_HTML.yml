figure_title: RTN3-null mouse kidneys showing mitochondrial structure damage
caption: a TEM analysis showing the mitochondrial structures in renal tubular cells
  of WT and RTN3-null mice. b Real-time PCR results showing the mRNA levels of MFN2,
  FIS1, OPA1, and RTN3 in WT and RTN3-null mouse kidneys. Western blot analysis showing
  the protein levels of MFN2, FIS1, OPA1, RTN3 and β-actin in c, d WT and RTN3-null
  mouse kidneys and e, f WT and RTN3-null mouse primary cultured renal tubular epithelial
  cells. g mRNA levels and h, i protein levels of MFN2, FIS1, OPA1, RTN3, and β-actin
  in HEK293 cells transfected with si-Control and si-RTN3.
article_title: Loss of RTN3 phenocopies chronic kidney disease and results in activation
  of the IGF2-JAK2 pathway in proximal tubular epithelial cells.
