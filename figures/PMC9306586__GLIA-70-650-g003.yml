caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of disease and function pathways. The 30 disease
  and function pathways with the highest p‐value in different comparisons among (a)
  all, (b) female, and (c) male groups. (d) Schizophrenia disease pathway and related
  molecules in the pathway in different comparisons. (e) Synaptic transmission function
  pathway and related molecules in the pathway in different comparisons. RNA sequence
  expression of the genes of interest in (f) females and (g) their validation by RT‐qPCR
  and (h) in males and (i) their validation. (f) and (h) have Benjamini–Hochberg corrected
  p‐value, and (g) and (i) have nominal p‐value calculated by unpaired t‐test. The
  data is presented as mean ± SD. Abbreviations: Ctrl, control, ST, affected twin,
  HT, unaffected co‐twin'
