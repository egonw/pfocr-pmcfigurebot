caption: Metabolomic profiling highlights differential lipid use in liver and muscle.
  (A) Metabolite subpathways were sorted according to average differential detection
  between light (ZT4, 8, 12) and dark (ZT16, 20, 0) conditions to identify metabolic
  processes altered by disease and diurnal rhythm in liver (Left) and muscle (Right)
  (gray bars represent total detected metabolites; points represent number of differentially
  detected metabolites at light (yellow), dark (blue), or transition (yellow and blue)
  time points). (B) Integrating differential gene expression (named genes; red and
  blue indicate significant up- and down-regulation, respectively) and metabolite-detection
  profiles (heat maps) into a schematic representation of the ceramide biosynthesis
  pathway in liver (Top) and muscle (Bottom) highlights the accumulation of ceramides
  and sphingolipids with disease. (C) We propose a model in which chronic inflammatory
  signaling impacts rhythmic metabolism in distal tissues via the EGFR/STAT3 circuit.
  This results in rhythmic accumulation of fatty acid precursors, increased ceramide
  abundance, and deleterious effects upon mitochondrial function.  was created with
