caption: Triple wild-type tumors harbor alternate Ras pathway alterations in the majority
  of tumors lacking a classical TCGA driver mutation. (a) In triple wild-type tumors,
  recurrently altered genes include TERT (n = 21), TP53 (n = 18), CDKN2A/B (n = 14),
  MAP2K1 (n = 7) and SPRED1 (n = 4). (b) In 28 of 33 cases (84.8%), pathogenic variants
  in known Ras pathway components are observed as putative driver mutations. (c) Recurrent
  alterations in non-Ras pathway genes in the triple wild-type group are predominantly
  the TERT and TP53 mutation, similar to other molecular groups, with additional mutations
  comprising potential drivers in tumors without a classic Ras pathway mutation. (d)
  Schematic depicting the mutations occurring in triple wild-type tumors (dark blue)
  within the Ras signaling pathway.
