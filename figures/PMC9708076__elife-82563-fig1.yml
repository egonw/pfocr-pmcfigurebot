figure_title: CO2 sensitivity is not simply due to lowered medium pH
caption: (A) H99 cells were plated onto RPMI solid medium buffered to either pH 6
  or pH 7. Fluconazole containing E-test strips were placed onto the lawn of H99 cells,
  and the plates were incubated at 37°C in ambient air or in 5% CO2. The larger the
  halo surrounding the E-strip, the more sensitive the cells are to fluconazole. The
  intercept value of the halo with the E-strip is the minimal inhibitory concentration.
  (B) Cells of the previously identified CO2-tolerant H99 and CO2-sensitive A7-35-23
  were serial diluted, spotted onto RPMI media buffered to pH 6 or pH 7, and incubated
  at 37°C in ambient air or in 5% CO2.
