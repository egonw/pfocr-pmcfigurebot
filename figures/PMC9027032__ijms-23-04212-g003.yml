caption: 'In vitro biocompatibility and osteogenesis of osteocytes on Ti and NTAs.
  (a) Live/dead staining of osteocytes cultured on each group after 1 day. (b) MTT
  results of osteocytes cultured on each group after 1 and 3 days. (c,d) Qualitative
  images and quantitative results of mineralization incubated on each group for 14
  and 28 days. * # p < 0.05 compared with Ti, ** p < 0.01 compared with Ti, ## p <
  0.01 compared with NTA-15, && p < 0.01 compared with NTA-60.'
