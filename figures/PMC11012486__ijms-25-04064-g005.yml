caption: PTPN12 overexpression downregulates the mRNA expression of CTGF and Cyr61.
  qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels of CTGF and Cyr61 in HEK293T-PTPN12 stable cell
  line in the absence (−) and presence (+) of Dox treatment. The relative mRNA levels
  were calculated based on the ratio of mRNA levels under ± conditions. The mean ±
  S.D. of the triplicate samples are shown. **, p ≤ 0.01 (statistical significance).
