caption: CB was enriched in small intestinal crypts and colon tumors. (A) Location
  and enrichment of CB in the small intestine and colon. The images on the left are
  the section of tissue stained by hematoxylin and eosin, scale bar, 50 µm, and the
  black circles mean the locations of FISH in small intestine (the top) and the colon
  tumor (the bottom). The images on the right are the section of tissue with FISH,
  scale bar, 150 µm. (B) Statistical analysis of FISH assessment. Error bars represent
  mean ± SD; **P<0.01. Ctrl, control group; CB, Clostridium butyricum; DAPI, 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole
  dihydrochloride; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; OTU, operational taxonomic unit;
  FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization.
article_title: Clostridium butyricum inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer
  and alleviates intestinal inflammation via the myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
