caption: Identification of module genes and their functional annotation. (A) Soft
  threshold of scale independence and mean connectivity by weighted gene co-expression
  network analysis. (B) Associations between 12 co-expressed modules and clinical
  characteristics. (C) GO-biological process, GO-cellular component and GO molecular
  function analyses revealed that the aforementioned module genes were significantly
  enriched in various cell cycle-related terms. (D) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the cell cycle pathway was significantly
  enriched. GO, Gene Ontology; ME, module eigengene.
