caption: Study outline. Proteomic data was obtained from the pooled and purified plasma
  samples of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) including all stages from
  CKD 1 to CKD 5. The most relevant proteins related to kidney disease initiation
  and progressions were selected by manual curation, as well as kidney specific protein
  analysis was performed. Next, dynamic profiles of proteins identified in all samples,
  as well as outliers, were performed with an emphasis on the degree of renal failure
  at which the greatest changes were observed. Functional pathway analysis of proteins
  included in the ascending and descending protein abundance profiles was assessed.
