figure_title: Heatmap overlays B cell compartment tSNE plots focusing on regulatory
  markers
caption: A total of 80,000 CD19+ B cells were used in an unbiased tSNE analysis of
  the B cell compartment with increasing disease severity ranked by ordinal scale
  1–3 (OS1 to 3) and in healthy controls (Control). This means a total of 20,000 CD19+
  B cells were contributed by each group. The B cell regulatory marker expression
  is represented as a heatmap with high (red) to low (blue) fluorescence intensity
  depicted.
