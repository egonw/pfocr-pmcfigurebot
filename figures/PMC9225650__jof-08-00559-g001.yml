caption: C. albicans Fun30 is a functional homolog of both S. cerevisiae Fun30 and
  human SMARCAD1. (A). Sensitivity to MMS and CPT of wild type YPH500 URA3 containing
  Yep HIS (YPH500-URA3-Yep HIS), Scfun30∆-YepHIS, and Scfun30∆ overexpressing C. albicans
  FUN30 (Scfun30∆-YepHIS-CaFUN30) was studied using plate (spot) assays. (B). γH2AX
  foci was monitored using confocal microscopy in HeLa cells without CPT treatment.
  (C). γH2AX foci was monitored using confocal microscopy in HeLa cells after treatment
  with 10 µM CPT for 5 h. (D). Quantitation of γH2AX positive cells. Control indicates
  HeLa cells transfected with control scrambled siRNA. The data is presented as an
  average ± s.d. of two independent experiments where at least 100 cells were counted
  in each experiment. * p < 0.05. In panels B and C, Red is γH2AX and Blue is DNA
  stained with Hoechst.
