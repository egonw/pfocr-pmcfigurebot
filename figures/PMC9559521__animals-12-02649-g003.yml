caption: 'The neurophysiology of milk ejection in dairy buffalo cow. Tactile stimulation
  of the MG is transformed into nerve impulses that are transmitted by the inguinal
  nerve to the inguinal ring, which continues as the genitofemoral nerve whose roots
  enter lumbar pair 3° and 4° (L3, L4), reaching the ganglion of the dorsal root (DRG).
  There, the impulses are modulated and transferred by the ascending pathway to the
  cerebral nuclei of the hypothalamus (PVN, SON) and then to neurohypophysis for oxytocin
  (Ox) synthesis. After its release, oxytocin is stored in the neurohypophysis and
  later secreted into the bloodstream where it reaches the Ox receptors in the MG
  and contracts alveolar tissue cells to trigger milk ejection. MPOA: medial preoptic
  area; PVN: paraventricular nucleus; SON: supraoptic nucleus.'
