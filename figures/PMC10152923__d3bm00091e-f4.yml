figure_title: Volcano and KEGG analyses at 14-day time point suggest Oligomer has
  a different molecular-level tissue response pathway compared to conventional implant
  materials. (A–D) Volcano plots of (A) sham, (B) Oligomer scaffold, (C) commercial
  collagen and (D) commercial mesh, featuring differentially expressed genes with
  |log2FC| > 1 & FDR < 0.01 (red) compared to normal tissue. (E–G) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the 10 most statistically significant pathways for (E) Oligomer scaffold,
  (F) commercial collagen, and (G) commercial mesh compared to normal tissue, featuring
  the number of DEGs (counts) occurring within each pathway; n = 5–6 per group
