figure_title: SR9009 downregulated the cell cycle pathway and suppressed lethal prostate
  cancer subtype 1 (PCS1)
caption: A Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes between the SR9009 group
  (n = 3) and DMSO group (n = 3) after RNA sequencing. B, C Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis of up- (B) and downregulated (C) pathways
  after SR9009 or DMSO was added; D, E Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis
  of the top 5 upregulated (D) and downregulated (E) pathways applying “c2.cp.v7.2.symbols.gmt
  [Curated]” from the MSigDB database. F GSEA of PCS1 after SR9009 or DMSO administration.
  G Cluster analysis of genes in PCS1, PCS2, and PCS3 between the SR9009 and DMSO
  groups. H Heatmap of genes in PCS1 after SR9009 or DMSO administration. I, J qPCR
  validations of genes downregulated in PCS1 in 22RV1 (I) and PC3 (J); n = 3; means ± SDs;
  ANOVA. K Western blot validation of SR9009 treatment on the expression of FOXM1
  and RRM2 in PC3 and 22RV1 cells. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001.
