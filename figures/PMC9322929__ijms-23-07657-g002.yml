caption: JIB-04 reduces the capacity of cell migration and invasion in HCC cells.
  (A) Cell migration was investigated with transwell assays after treatment with DMSO,
  6 µM JIB-04, or 4 µM TSA for 24 h (n = 3). (B) Invasive ability was examined in
  transwells coated with Matrigel after treatment with DMSO, 6 µM JIB-04, or 4 µM
  TSA for 24 h (PLC/PRF/5 (n = 4); Huh7 (n = 3)). (C) Cell migration was assessed
  with a wound-healing assay. Cells were scraped with a yellow pipette tip and treated
  with DMSO, 6 µM JIB-04, or 4 µM TSA for 24 h. Cells were imaged under a light microscope
  after injury. Cell migration was quantified by measuring remaining wound areas before
  and after treatment with DMSO, 6 µM JIB-04, or 4 µM TSA. Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM of triplicate measurements. * p < 0.05, ** p <0.01 compared with DMSO-treated
  controls.
