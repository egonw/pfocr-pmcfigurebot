caption: Representation of the main altered metabolic pathways and the main metabolites
  observed in studies of targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, as well as their
  relationship with some general implications for asthma. The left-hand side of the
  figure includes the most important pathway (lipid metabolism) and some of its metabolites,
  also demonstrating how these metabolites have implications for inflammatory processes,
  cell proliferation and signaling. In the centre, some metabolites of carbohydrate
  metabolism and citric acid cycle (TCA) are shown. These have been shown to have
  implications for activating the immune system and generating energy. On the right-hand
  side, some metabolites of the altered amino acid pathway are identified. These are
  involved in the immune response and energy metabolism.
