caption: 'PI3K inhibitors induce apoptosis in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
  cells with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss. A. Three cells lines were treated with
  alpelisib at the indicated concentrations. Cells were stained with annexin V/PI
  and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion of apoptotic cells. HCC1954
  and HCC1569 cells were collected 48 hours after treatment, whereas UACC893 cells
  were analyzed at 72 hours. The x-axis indicates the intensity of annexin V, whereas
  the y-axis indicates PI. B. Cells lines were treated with GDC-0077 at the indicated
  concentrations and the proportion of apoptotic cells were analyzed. C. Lysates were
  collected 24 hours after alpelisib or GDC-0077 treatment and subjected to immunoblotting
  for detection of cleaved-PARP antibody. Equal loading of proteins was verified using
  beta-actin. The numbers under each blot represent the intensity of cleaved-PARP
  relative to that of the control. Experiments were repeated at least three times
  and the results are summarized as bar charts. Each bar represents the mean Â± SD.
  P-value: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001.'
