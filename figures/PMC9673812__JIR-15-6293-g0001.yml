caption: Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate alleviates atherosclerosis in ApoE−/− mice.
  (A) Body Weight, (B) plasma total cholesterol (TC) level, (C) plasma triglyceride
  (TG) level, (D) Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) level, and (E)
  plasma high density liptein cholesterol (HDL-c) level. (F) H&E staining of the aortic
  arches of the ApoE−/− mice. (G) Masson staining of the aortic arches. (H) Oil red
  O staining of the aortic arches. Data are represented as mean ± SD of three independent
  replicates; **P < 0.01 vs NCD group; †P < 0.05, ††P < 0.01 vs AS model group.
