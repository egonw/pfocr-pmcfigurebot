figure_title: Computational network modeling identifies MCL1 upregulation as an adaptive
  response to BET inhibition
caption: (A) The TargetScore algorithm (see ) identifies network-level adaptive responses
  to targeted perturbations based on molecular drug response data. The method involves
  (1) molecular profiling of responses to perturbations in samples with varying sensitivity
  to the perturbation agent. (2) Construction of a reference network that captures
  potential relations between all measured proteomic entities. (3) Quantification
  of a sample-specific adaptation (target) score that links protein interactions to
  drug response on the reference network using proteomic data. (4) Identification
  of network modules that have a significantly high TargetScore (i.e., collectively
  participate in adaptive responses) in each sample. (5) Selection of actionable targets
  that participate in adaptive responses and experimental testing of drug combinations.(B)
  Heatmaps capture the highest and lowest 10 TargetScores for 24 (left) and 48 (right)
  h post-treatment in 3D cultures. The ranking in the HCC1954 is used as reference,
  and cell lines are ordered from most resistant (HCC1954) to most sensitive (SKOV3).(C)
  Analysis and statistical assessment of adaptive responses (positive TargetScore)
  and direct responses (negative TargetScore) in HCC1954 24 (left) and 48 h (right)
  post-treatment. TargetScores are based on the average values across the four BETis
  in . The Q values represent the FDR-adjusted p values against the TargetScore-null
  distribution.(D) Network modules of adaptive responses and mechanisms of action
  24 (left) and 48 h (right) post-treatment. Asterisk (*) denotes the significantly
  strong TargetScores according to the statistical validation (see ).(E) Association
  of MCL1 mean TargetScore across four BETis (top) and BETi sensitivity (bottom).
  The Spearman correlation between the predicted adaptive responses to BETi and resistance
  to BETi is 0.9 (p = 0.04).(F) Copy-number and mRNA expression status of MCL1 in
  cell lines.(G) The frequency of breast cancer samples with high- (red) and low-
  (pink) level copy-number increases in MCL1.(H) Distribution of MCL1 mRNA levels
  with varying MCL1 copy-number statuses across breast cancer samples (TCGA).
