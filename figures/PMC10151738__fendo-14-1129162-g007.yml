caption: The impact of GART inhibition on 4OH-tamoxifen sensitive and resistant cell
  lines. Western blot analyses of ERα expression levels in Y537S cells treated with
  GART siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 hours (A) and with the indicated doses (C) of
  lometrexol (LMX) for 48 hours. Blots are representative images. Densitometric and
  statistical analyses are reported in . Growth curve analyses in Y537S cells were
  performed as indicated in the material and method section for 3 days in cells treated
  with GART siRNA oligonucleotides (B) and for 5 days in cells treated with the indicated
  doses of lometrexol (LMX) (D). The graphs show the normalized cell index (i.e.,
  cell number), which is detected with the xCelligence DP device and calculated at
  each time point with respect to the control sample. Each sample was measured in
  quadruplicate. For details, please see the material and methods section. (E) Estrogen
  response element promoter activity in MCF-Y537S ERE-NLuc cells treated with lometrexol
  (LMX 1 µM) for 48 hours. The experiments were performed three times in quintuplicate.
  Significant differences were calculated with the Anova test. **** (p-value < 0.0001)
  indicates significant differences with respect to untreated (i.e., 0) sample. Linear
  regression and Spearman Correlation values between the sensitivity to 4OH-Tamoxifen
  (Tam) anti-proliferative activity calculated by performing the -Log2 transformation
  of the inhibitor concentration 50 (IC50) for Tam and the sensitivity to lometrexol
  (LMX)-induced ERα degradation effect as calculated by extrapolating the effective
  concentration 50 (EC50) and -Log2 transforming it in different BC cell lines stratified
  in luminal A (LumA, green dots) and luminal B (LumB, red dots) and non-invasive
  ductal carcinomas (Not-IDC) (F) or invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) (G). r and p-values
  are given in the main panels. Tam-induced dose-response curves are reported in .
article_title: A functional genetic screen for metabolic proteins unveils GART and
  the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as novel targets for the treatment of luminal
  A ERα expressing primary and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma.
