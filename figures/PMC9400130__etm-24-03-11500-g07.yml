caption: LTBP2 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells in
  vitro. (A) RT-qPCR assay showed the mRNA expression levels of LTBP2 in prostate
  cells (RWPE-1) and PCa cell lines (LNcap and DU145). (B) Western blot assay showed
  the protein expression levels of LTBP2 in prostate cells (REPW-1) and PCa cell lines
  (LNcap and DU145). (C) Relative expression of LTBP2 by RT-qPCR in PCa cells transfected
  with OE-LTBP2 and NC. (D) Relative expression of LTBP2 determined by western blotting
  in PCa cells transfected with OE-LTBP2 and NC. (E) Transwell assays showed the migration
  and invasive abilities of PCa cells transfected with OE-LTBP2 and NC. (F) CCK-8
  assays showed the proliferation capacity of PCa cells transfected with OE-LTBP2
  and NC. (G) Western blot assay displayed the protein levels changes in PCa cells
  transfected with OE-LTBP2 and NC. All experiments were repeated three times. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01. LTBP2, latent transforming growth factor Î²-binding protein 2; PCa, prostate
  cancer; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction; OE,
  overexpressed; NC, negative control; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.
