caption: High PPC induces hyperglycemia by activating the gluconeogenic pathway(A)
  Trehalose and glucose levels in hemolymph (n = 3).(B) Fat body index and glycogen
  content in the fat body (n = 3). Fat body index = fat body weight/pupa weight.(C)
  Transcription levels of key genes of the gluconeogenesis pathway involved in the
  conversion of alanine, glycine, tyrosine, and serine were determined by qRT-PCR
  (n = 3). ALT, alanine aminotransferase gene; m-GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase gene;
  SHMT, serine hydroxymethyl transferase gene; FAH, fumarase gene; PC, pyruvate carboxylase
  gene; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene.(D) Relative expression of genes
  related to trehalose synthesis (n = 3). TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene;
  Tres, trehalose synthetase gene.(E) Transcriptional level of key genes for glycogen
  synthesis (n = 3). Gbe, glycogen branching enzyme gene; Gys, glycogen synthase gene;
  Gsk, glycogen synthase kinase gene. sw22934 was used as the reference gene for qRT-PCR.The
  data were mean ± SD, and the significance of the difference in the Student’s t test
  was ns, p > 0.05; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001.
