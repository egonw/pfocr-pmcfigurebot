caption: '(a) mtDNA replisome and mtDNA amount in patient cerebellum. Western blot
  and quantification (loading control ATP5A) and native POLG replisome complex amount
  (loading control HSP60 complex) from isolated mitochondria; qPCR for mtDNA amount
  (mtDNA, MTCO1 relative to nuclear gene, B2M). N = 2 patient cerebellar samples and
  6 (or 5 for native complex analysis) controls, all females. Mean ± SEM; two-tailed
  unpaired student’s t test. (b) Immune-related gene expression in MIRAS patients’
  cerebral cortex. qPCR of cDNA, reference gene ACTB. N = 3 patients and 6 controls,
  all females; box plot: minimum-25th-50th(median)-75th percentile-maximum (whiskers
  extend to the smallest and largest value); + symbol indicates the mean expression
  value; two-tailed unpaired student’s t test. (c-g) Pathway enrichment analyses of
  MIRAS patient cerebral cortex transcriptome. RNA-seq; N = 3 patients compared to
  5 controls, all females. (c) Ingenuity pathway analysis using genes with p-value < 0.05
  in MIRAS patient/control transcriptome. The most significantly affected (based on
  p-value; Fisher’s exact test) canonical pathways with their predicted activation
  or inactivation status are tabulated. Red: predicted activation (z-score≥2); blue:
  predicted inactivation (z-score ≤ −2); grey: pathway with no predicted significant
  activation/inhibition. (d) Inhibition of Interferon (IFN) signalling. Heatmap: fold
  change of IFN signalling gene expressions in MIRAS patients compared to the controls,
  and gene mapping onto the IFN-signalling pathway (generated by Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis). (e) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated genes (p-value < 0.05;
  Fold change > −1.5) in MIRAS patients compared to controls; generated using gProfiler
  server; Fisher’s one-tailed test with multiple testing correction using the server
  default algorithm g:SCS. (f, g) Integrated network summary of canonical pathways,
  upstream regulators, diseases and biological functions associated with patient/control
  cerebral cortex transcriptome (genes with p-value < 0.05). Generated using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis knowledgebase. The network in g shows also predicted relationships
  to transcripts with levels altered in the dataset.'
