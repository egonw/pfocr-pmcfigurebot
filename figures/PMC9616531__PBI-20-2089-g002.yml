caption: Marker genes identification by qRT‐PCR of 6 isolated tissues from 3 L. (a)
  Heatmap of verified marker gene. The original expression data was given in the .
  (b) Identified cell types of 6 isolated tissues under the light microscope. Upper
  epidermis (UE), lower epidermis (LE), xylem (XY) and phloem and procambia (PH) were
  stained with safranin O/fast green, which stained lignified cells red and cytoplasm
  green. Spongy mesophyll cells (SM) and palisade mesophyll cells (PM) were isolated
  according to published methods and observed directly under the light microscope.
  (c) tSNE plots with the expression of selected marker genes for six tissues.
