caption: The effect of inhibition of miR-93-5p on the apoptosis in GC. (A) Cells were
  transfected with the si-NC and si-miR93-5p lentivirus. (B) The expression of miR-93-5p
  in GC detected by RT-qPCR. (C) Cell viability in the si-NC and si-miR93-5p groups
  detected by CCK-8 assay. (D, E) Flow cytometry assay displayed the apoptosis level
  in two groups and bar charts are used for visualization. (F, G) Bax and Bcl-2 protein
  expression were determined by western blotting in two groups. p < 0.05 (“*”), p
  < 0.01 (“**”). GC, granulosa cell; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction; CCK-8, cell counting kit-8.
