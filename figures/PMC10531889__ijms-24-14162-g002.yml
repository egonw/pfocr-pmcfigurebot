caption: Visual analysis of DEGs and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (A) Volcano
  plot of DEGs of the HFD group (HFD), nano-DEN group (nano-DEN), and coexposure group
  (HFD + nano-DEN) in liver tissues. Red dots represent significantly upregulated
  genes, blue dots represent significantly downregulated genes, and black dots represent
  nonsignificant genes. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in the liver
  tissues of mice in the HFD group, nano-DEN group, and coexposure group. The x-axis
  represents the enrichment factor, and the y-axis represents the pathway terms. The
  diameters of the circles represent the number of DEGs in the pathway. The color
  gradient on the right represents the p-value. The symbol ↑ highlighted in red indicates
  an increase in ranking position, ↓ indicates an decrease.
