caption: Effect of SL on nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7
  cells. Localization of NF-κB p65 (red) was visualized using confocal microscopy
  after immunofluorescent staining. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Results
  are representative of those obtained from three independent tests.
