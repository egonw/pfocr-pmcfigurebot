figure_title: The perturbation response network of the E. coli central metabolic pathway
  obtained from the analysis
caption: The numbers at the bottom of each box indicate the reaction parameters that
  were perturbed. The chemical name in each box and in all boxes followed by an arrow
  extending downward indicates the chemicals whose concentration changes in response
  to a given perturbation. Colors correspond to those in  [].
