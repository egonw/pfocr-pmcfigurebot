figure_title: SCD is the final protein effector of the AdipoR2-S1P pathway
caption: A, B Western-Blot and quantification of WT and DKO MEFs in A and NT and AdipoR2/PPARγ/SCD
  siRNA in HEK293 cells in full media or basal media ± PA 200 µM. Uncropped blots
  in Source Data. C–F PA (16:0) and OA (18:1) abundance (mol%) and in the PC of HEK293
  cells treated with different siRNA and PA 200 μM ± S1P 1 μM. For C and D, n = 4
  independent biological replicates per condition. For E and F, n = 3 independent
  biological replicates per condition. Related lipidomics are shown in Supplementary
  Fig.  and in Data 6. G Average GP index from several images of NT and SCD siRNA
  HEK293 cells treated with vehicle and PA 200 µM ± S1P 10 µM and ± OA 200 µM. n = 15
  separate images analyzed for each condition. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
  t-tests (two sided and assuming normality) were used to identify significant differences
  between treatments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. See also Supplementary
  Fig.  and Supplementary Data –. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
