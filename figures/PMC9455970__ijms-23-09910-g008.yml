caption: Silencing of NME1 and NME2 activates PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in WM793B
  cell line. Protein expression of NME1 and NME2 is reduced in vemurafenib-resistant
  WM793B cell line compared to parental line (A). Expression of EMT markers (B), signaling
  pathway, and proliferation markers (C) after silencing of NME1 and NME2 protein
  expression in WM793B cell line. Untreated samples (NT), samples transfected with
  the control siRNA (CTRL siRNA), and samples silenced with siNME1 and siNME2 (siNME1/2)
  were analyzed by western blot. β-actin was used as a loading control. A representative
  western blot from at least three experiments (three biological replicates) is shown.
  The viability of WM793B cells at increasing concentrations of vemurafenib was measured
  by MTT assay (D). The viability of untreated cells (NT), cells after transfection
  with control siRNA (CTRL siRNA), and cells after silencing of NME1 and NME2 protein
  expression (siNME1/2) is shown. The mean values of three biological replicates with
  standard deviations are shown. Each biological replicate was prepared in triplicate.
  The proliferation rate of untreated primary melanoma WM793B cells (NT), after transfection
  with control siRNA (CTRL siRNA), and cells after silencing of NME1 and NME2 protein
  expression (siNME1/2) (E). The mean values of two biological replicates with standard
  deviations are shown. Each biological replicate was prepared in triplicate.
