figure_title: Affects of compounds (i.e., instances) on the FOXM1 pathway activity
  and expression pattern
caption: a The FOXM1 pathway activity score differences derived from the 1390 CMAP
  gene expression instances. The y-axis shows the difference between the activity
  score in the treatment and the paired control for each instance. The x-axis shows
  the instances ordered by increasing corresponding activity score difference. b The
  connectivity score of the 1390 CMAP gene expression instances where the y-axis shows
  the connectivity score and the x-axis shows the instances ordered by increasing
  corresponding connectivity score. c A Venn diagram showing the intersection between
  the top 50 drugs identified by the activity score difference and the activity score.
