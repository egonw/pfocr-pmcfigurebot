figure_title: c-Met/PI3K/Akt pathway regulates miR-199a-3p through a positive feedback
  loop
caption: A Expression of miR-199a-3p under shear stress, HGF treatment, and combination
  of shear stress and HGF. B Expression of p-Akt and total Akt under shear stress,
  HGF, and LY 294002 treatment. C Expression of miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-1 when treated
  with LY 294002 under shear stress. D Expression of p-c-Met and total c-Met under
  shear stress, HGF, and c-Met inhibitor K-252a. E Expression of miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-1
  when treated with K-252a under shear stress. F Expression of p-c-Met, total c-Met,
  p-Akt, total-Akt, and G. c-Met mRNA in miR-199a-3p overexpressing cells. Bar graph
  values are mean ± SD, n = 3 for q-PCR and mean ± SD of three replicate measures
  of respective bands for Western Blot quantification. T-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005,
  ***P < 0.0005.
