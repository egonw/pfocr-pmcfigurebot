caption: (A) DEGs number of secondary processes included in the signaling pathway,
  the up-/downregulated gene number was marked by orange/blue color. (B) DEGs number
  of secondary processes of the secondary metabolism pathway. (C) DEGs number of secondary
  processes of the cell wall pathway. (D) Heatmap of gene expression in control group
  and silkworm feeding group, the representative functional genes participating in
  secondary processes of signaling pathway. (E) Heatmap of genes in secondary metabolism
  pathway. (F) Heatmap of genes in cell wall pathway.
