caption: Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the effects of BDP-9066 using gene
  expression profiles of sensitive and resistant cell lines. (A) Hierarchical clustering
  by differentially expressed genes. The sensitive and resistant cell lines for BDP-9066
  are fully classified. The sensitive cell lines include BT549, HCC1395, HS578T and
  the resistant ones include BT474, BT483, ZR7530. (B) Principal component analysis
  was performed with the gene expression profiles of the sensitive and resistant cell
  lines used in A. Similar to the result of A, the cells are divided into the sensitive
  and resistant cell lines. (C) MA plots representing differentially expressed genes
  between sensitive and resistant cell lines. (D) A summary of the results of pathway
  analysis performed using a group of genes that are specifically highly expressed
  in the sensitive cell lines. The results of pathway analysis are shown in Supplementary
  . Pathways found in Gene Ontology (Biological Process) and 3 pathway databases (KEGG,
  WikiPathways, Reactome) are shown in the same color, respectively. Also, the possible
  relationship between each group is indicated by arrows.
