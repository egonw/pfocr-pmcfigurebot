figure_title: Integrated multilevel proteomic analyses showed different pathogenic
  mechanism of DGC and IGC
caption: a The association of Lauren classification with clinical information. Two-sided
  Fisher’s exact test is used for categorical variables. b The association of Lauren
  classification with clinical outcomes. n (DGC) = 83 and n (IGC) = 102 biologically
  independent samples. P-values are from Log-rank test. c Representative differentially
  expressed proteins in the featured pathways of DGC and IGC. d Microenvironment scores
  and immune scores of DGC and IGC. n (DGC) = 83 and n (IGC) = 100 biologically independent
  samples. Violin plots show median and interquartile range. The p-values are from
  two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. e Comparison of immune cell infiltration between
  DGC and IGC. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used. The Benjamini–Hochberg (BH)
  adjusted p-values are 0.019 (NK cells), 0.0016 (NKT), 1.71E-9 (CD4 + T-cells), 1.89E-12
  (CD4 + memory T-cells), 0.0017 (CD8 + T-cells), 0.00056 (CD8 + Tem), and 4.25E-7
  (Macrophages). f Integrated analysis of cell cycle regulation pathway at protein,
  kinase, TF activity and phospho-site levels in DGC and IGC. g Integrated analysis
  of DNA mismatch repair pathway at protein, kinase and phospho-site levels in DGC
  and IGC. h The expression of CDK4 and ATR in DGC and IGC. n (DGC) = 10 and n (IGC) = 16
  biologically independent samples. Boxplots show median (central line), upper and
  lower quartiles (box limits), min to max range. The p-values are calculated by two-sided
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test. i The prognostic analyses of CDK4 and ATR in TCGA cohort.
  In comparison of CDK4, n (high expression) = 9 and n (low expression) = 13 biologically
  independent samples. In comparison of ATR, n (high expression) = 32 and n (low expression) = 42
  biologically independent samples. The p-value is calculated using Log-rank test.

  ***p < 1.0e-3, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. Source data are provided as a Source Data
