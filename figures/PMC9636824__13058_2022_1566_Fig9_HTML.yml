caption: Proposed model for differences observed in the Rb pathway in ER + and ER-
  tumors. The blue and orange colors of the Rb pathway members indicate increased
  or decreased expression relative to normal mammary gland derived from RNAseq data.
  Black framed white boxes include observed and white boxes framed in dashed frames
  contain proposed outcomes of Rb pathway status. A In B1/P/Rbf ER-positive tumors,
  binding of T121 suppresses the activity of pRb, p107 and p130 proteins, releasing
  E2F inhibition and allowing progression of transcription of multiple genes involved
  in cell cycle regulation, including increased expression of cyclin E1, p107, CDK2
  and CDK4. Inhibition of p130 activity in particular may result in release of a p130
  complex from the Esr1 promoter that can lead to decrease in promoter methylation
  and thus to increased expression of ER. High ER levels, although not contributing
  to tumor proliferation directly via ER pathway, can still cross-activate additional
  pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR that were upregulated in tumors. B B1/P basal-like
  ER- tumors downregulated Rb1. Loss of pRb leads to release of E2F and to transcription
  of cell cycle regulating genes, including increased expression of cyclin D1, p130,
  and p16. Additional G2/M checkpoint genes can still be repressed by various complexes
  that p130 and p107 form with E2F proteins. Increased expression of p130 may lead
  to Esr1 promoter methylation through a p130 complex on Esr1 promoter, and thus to
  loss of ER expression
