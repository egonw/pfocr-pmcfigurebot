caption: RNA-sequencing analysis shows a dysregulated EGF/ERBB signaling pathway in
  patient-derived NPCs. (A) Transcriptome analysis pipeline. (B) Transcripts common
  and unique to B1 and B2 patient-derived lines. (C) Comparison of fold change for
  common transcripts between the two patient-derived neural precursor lines. (D) Protein
  interaction network, centered on ERBB4, that is downregulated in patient-derived
  NPCs. The interactions were plotted using the STRING online database (https://string-db.org/).
  The entire interaction network is shown in .
