figure_title: METTL3 enhances STEAP2 mRNA stability via an m6A–YTHDF1-dependent pathway
caption: A By retrieving the TCGA dataset and using algorithms (m6a2target), m6a “writer”
  protein METTL3 were identified to be able to potentially interact with STEAP2 mRNA.
  Pearson correlation analysis between STEAP2 and METTL3 mRNA levels in Pan-cancer
  cohort (B) and PTC cohort (C) retrieved from TCGA. D MeRIP-qPCR analysis was employed
  to demonstrate METTL3-mediated STEAP2 m6A modifications. The m6A modification of
  STEAP2 was increased on upregulation of METTL3, while it was depleted on METTL3
  silencing. The expression levels of STEAP2 in METTL3-overexpressing and METTL3 knockdown
  PTC cells were detected by qRT-PCR (E) and western blot (F). G STEAP2 mRNA level
  in METTL3-overexpressing or METTL3-knockdown PTC cells treated with actinomycin
  D at the indicated time points were detected by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of
  STEAP2 in YTHDF1-overexpressing PTC cells were detected by qRT-PCR (H) and western
  blot (I). J STEAP2 mRNA level in TYTHDF1-overexpressing PTC cells treated with actinomycin
  D at the indicated time points were detected by qRT-PCR. All data are presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001.
