caption: 'Effects of HRW on the NF-κB signaling pathway in rats with chronic gut inflammation.
  (A) Blot bands of protein expression related to the NF-κB signaling pathway. Protein
  expression of the NFκB signaling pathway was detected by Western blotting: (B) TLR4;
  (C) MyD88; (D) IκBα and p-IκBα; (E) p65 and p-p65 and their ratios; (F) p65 and
  p-p65 and their ratios. # p < 0.05; **, ## p < 0.01.'
