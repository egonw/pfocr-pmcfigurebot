caption: 'The effects of PLXND1 signalling in vessel development and systemic sclerosis
  (SSc). These signalling pathways mediate antiangiogenesis: SEMA3C‐PLXND1/NRP1 signalling
  induces VE‐cadherin internalization and suppress VEGF signalling, then disrupts
  endothelial cell (EC) junctions, focal adhesions and cytoskeleton assembly; PLXND1
  signalling induces soluble flt‐1 expression to negatively control vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) signalling; SEMA4A‐PLXND1 signalling inhibits EC migration
  by suppressing the VEGF signalling and integrin‐dependent cell adhesion; SEMA3E‐PLXND1
  signalling activates Arf6 by GEP100, resulting in the disassembly of integrin‐mediated
  focal adhesions; SEMA3E‐PLXND1 signalling deactivates the R‐ras, induces ECs repulsion;
  SH3BP1 mediates the inactivation of Rac1 induced by SEMA3E‐PLXND1 signalling to
  initiate actin disassembly; SEMA3D‐PLXND1 signalling mediates the repulsion of ECs;
  this signalling pathway mediates angiogenesis: SEMA4A‐PLXND1signalling could enhance
  the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor‐A in infiltrating macrophages,
  thereby activating angiogenesis'
