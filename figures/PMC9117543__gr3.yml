caption: NMR-based metabonomics analysis of livers in old and iron-overload mice.A,
  score plot and loading plot from OPLS-DA analysis of the spectra from livers of
  the control mice and iron-overload mice (n = 6). B, score plot and loading plot
  from OPLS-DA analysis of the spectra from livers of the control mice and old mice
  (n = 6–7). C, heatmap visualization for liver samples from three groups. D, metabolite
  pathway enrichment analysis of iron-overload mice (left) and old mice (right) using
  data obtained by MetaboAnalyst 3.0. Red bars indicated the same changed metabolic
  pathways between HI and OLD groups. E and F, a 200 times permutation test of OPLS-DA
  models for iron-overload mice and old mice, respectively. G, PCA score plot of all
  three groups (n = 6–7). H, PCA scree plot showing the variance explained with the
  five principal components. The two lines stand for the individual (bottom) or cumulative
  (top) variance explained by the principal components, respectively. I, liver oxidative
  stress and liver injury levels in livers of iron-overload and old mice. SOD activities,
  CAT activities, MDA levels, and GSH levels in livers, and serum AST and ALT levels
  were determined. Iron overload was induced by i.p. injection of iron dextran (5 mg/mouse/day)
  twice a week for 3 weeks, and 64-week-old male mice were used for the old group.
  All data are expressed as the means ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, n = 5). Four-week-old
  male C57BL/6 mice were used to induce iron overload by i.p. injection of iron dextran
  (5 mg/mouse/day) twice a week for 3 weeks, and mice were sacrificed 1 week after
  the last injection. And 64-week-old male mice were used for the old group. ALT,
  alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransaminase; CAT, catalase; HI, iron-overload
  group; MDA, malondialdehyde; OLD, old group; OPLS-DA, orthogonal partial least squares
  discriminant analysis; PCA, principal component analysis; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
