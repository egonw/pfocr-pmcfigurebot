caption: 'Reduced Dicer expression causes downregulation of DNA repair protein expression
  and cell-cycle changes in stress-loaded hepatocytes: (A) DNA repair proteins in
  hepatocytes with Dicer knockdown were examined with Western blot and quantification
  data of the γ-H2AX and 53BP1 protein levels. Cells were exposed to pressure for
  48 h; (B) cell-cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry following Dicer
  knockdown and pressure loading for 48 h. The images are representative of three
  independent experiments. The stacked bar graph indicates the percentage of cells
  at various stages of the cell cycle. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. n = 3,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
