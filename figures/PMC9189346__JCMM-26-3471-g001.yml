caption: FOXD1 is the most differentially expressed transcription factor in the top
  10 TFs covering the most downstream DEGs. A. Heatmap of differentially expressed
  genes between tumour and normal tissues. B. The top 10 most significantly enriched
  KEGG pathways of DEGs in CRC. Size of the circle represents a number of genes enriched
  in this pathway. C. The volcano plot of DEGs showing FOXD1 and other 9 TFs covering
  the most downstream DEGs. D. Heatmap of the top 10 TFs covering the most downstream
  DEGs. FOXD1 is the most differentially expressed transcription factor of the 10 TFs
