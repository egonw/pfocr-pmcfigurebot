caption: 'Autophagosomes under TEM. MDBK cells are pretreated for 6 h with 10 μM DAPT,
  and then stimulated for another 24 h with 25.5 mM glucose. TEM images of autophagic
  vacuoles (red double arrow) were shown in MDBK cells from Control, HG, and HG +
  DAPT treatment groups (Scale bar: 2 μm). ** p < 0.01 compared with control group;
  ##: p < 0.01.'
