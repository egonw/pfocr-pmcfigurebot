caption: Swapping Pbad for native polyyne promoter and heterologous expression comparison.
  (A) Cloning strategy for swapping the BAD promoter of the pMLBAD_yeast_polyyne constructs
  for the native promoter of each BGC. F1, F2 and F3 represent the overlapping PCR
  fragments used to clone each respective polyyne pathway (see  for PCR primers).
  Yeast homologous recombination was used to replace the araC‐Pbad portion of the
  constructs with the native promoter (NP) fused to a kanamycin‐resistant cassette
  (KmR). The production of caryoynencin (B) and cepacin (C) by the native and recombinant
  hosts on different media types displayed in the bubble chart, with the size of each
  bubble representing the integrated HPLC peak area normalised by the dry biomass.
  The mean size of each bubble (n = 9) is displayed underneath with the standard deviation
  (SD) in brackets. The empty cells in the chart show the absence of polyyne detection.
article_title: Cloning and expression of Burkholderia polyyne biosynthetic gene clusters
  in Paraburkholderia hosts provides a strategy for biopesticide development.
