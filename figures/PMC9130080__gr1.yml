caption: Effect of TCS on Neuro-2a cell viability and morphology. The cells were treated
  with varying concentration of TCS (1, 10, 30 and 50 µM) for 24 h. DMSO treated cells
  were considered as control. (a) MTT assay was performed to evaluate the viability
  of cells. The result is considered as mean ± SEM. of three independent experiments.
  * represents p < 0.05 as compared with the vehicle-treated control group, which
  was considered 100% viable. (b) Representative acridine orange/ethidium bromide
  dual staining images of the cells after TCS treatment. The magnification and scale
  bar for (b) are 200× and 50 µm respectively. The histogram shows the quantification
  of images in (b) using ImageJ software. Data are mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiment. TCS, triclosan. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
