caption: LINC00460 promoted RCC cells growth and metastasis in vivo. (A) 786-O cells
  were injected into nude mice after the transfection of shLINC00460 and shCtrl vector.
  (B) The growth curves of tumors from subcutaneously injected nude mice treated with
  shLINC00460 or shCtrl (*** p<0.001). (C) The weights of tumors from subcutaneously
  injected nude mice treated with shLINC00460 or shCtrl (* p<0.05). (D) The levels
  of LINC00460 expression in paired tumor tissues formed from subcutaneously injected
  nude mice treated with shLINC00460 or shCtrl, determined by qRT-PCR (*** p<0.001).
  (E) Representative bioluminescence images and statistical analysis of lung metastases
  in mice via tail vein injection of indicated cells (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). (F)
  Representative H&E images and statistical analysis of resected lung xenografts with
  metastatic loci (*** p < 0.001).
