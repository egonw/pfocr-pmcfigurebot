caption: The mechanism of carcinogenesis of TSNAs (NNK, NNN, NNA) from THS. TSNAs
  can cause mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which affect cell proliferation,
  survival, migration, and invasion, and ultimately lead to cancer development. Metabolically
  activated TSNAs induce DNA adducts that can be eliminated by a functional DNA repair
  network, but unresolved DNA adducts further lead to mutations in oncogenes and suppressor
  genes, the first step in TSNAs-induced carcinogenesis. After NNK exposure, the level
  of the 8-OHdG adduct in lung tissue increased, which is a marker of DNA oxidative
  damage. NNA exposure decreased RPS3, so less RPS3 is transferred to the nucleus
  to bind 8-oxoGuo DNA lesions, and the repair of 8-oxoGuo lesions is not activated.
  Therefore, 8-OHdG accumulates, as does DNA damage. More interestingly, the decrease
  in the level of 5-mC level after NNA exposure alters DNA methylation levels and
  affects epigenetic modification. In addition, the binding of NNK, NNN, and NNA to
  nAChRs promotes tumor growth by regulating cell proliferation, cell survival, cell
  migration, and cell invasion, which is the second step in inducing cancer. The binding
  of NNK to α7nAChRs and NNN to αβnAChRs activates the Ca2+ channel of the voltage
  gate, causing Ca2+ to flood into lung cells, leading to membrane depolarization.
  In turn, protein kinase C, serine/threonine kinases, RAF1, mitogen-activated extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and ERK2, and transcription factors FOS, JUN, and
  MYC are activated, leading to cell proliferation. NNK acts as an agonist of β-ARs
  and binds directly to them with high affinity to activate epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) via cAMP signals initiated by β-ARs, thus initiating the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-MAPK
  pathway and affecting cell proliferation. NNA may increase the level of mitochondrial
  Ca2+ and intracellular ROS by binding to α3β2nAChRs and α7nAChRs, thus affecting
  the cellular microenvironment.
