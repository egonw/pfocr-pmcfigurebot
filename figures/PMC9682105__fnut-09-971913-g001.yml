caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the design of the bidirectional MR analysis and
  the process of instrument selection. Assumption I: The selected genetic variants
  are associated with exposure. Assumption II: The genetic instruments are not associated
  with potential confounders. Assumption III: The genetic instruments are associated
  with outcome only through the pathway from exposure. The flow chart of genetic instruments
  selection is shown.'
