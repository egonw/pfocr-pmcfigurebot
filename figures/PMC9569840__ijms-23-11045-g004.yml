caption: Metabolic pathway analysis based on DEGs filtering (−1 > log2FC > 1; p-value
  < 0.005) for T0 vs. T1, T0 vs. T2, and T1 vs. T2 comparison in apricot ‘Goldrich’
  and Japanese plum ‘Santa Rosa’. Advanced bubble chart shows enrichment of DEGs to
  each signaling pathway. The Y-axis label represents the pathway, and the X-axis
  label represents the rich factor. The size and color of the bubble represent the
  amount of DEGs enriched in pathway and enrichment significance, respectively.
