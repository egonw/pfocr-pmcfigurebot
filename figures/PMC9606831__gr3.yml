caption: High glucose condition promotes the stemness of PC cells. (A) Heat map depicting
  the relationship among different signaling pathways, glycolysis, and immune infiltration
  in pancreatic tumors. (B) Network anaylis depicting the relationship among genes
  involved in stemness, glycolysis, and immune infiltration. (C) Western blot for
  Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, and Oct4 protein expression in PC cells and CD133 and CD24 expression
  on the cell surface in SW1990, Bxpc-3, and CFPAC-1cells treated with differential
  glucose treatment for 48 hours. (D) Sphere-forming ability of PC cells of generation
  1 and generation 2 in the serum-free medium under high glucose or normal glucose
  conditions, scale bar, 100 μm. Data presented in the graphs represented means ±
  standard deviation from 3 parallel experiments. ∗∗∗P < .001; ∗∗P < .01; ∗P < .05.
