caption: 'Transcriptomic profile of DDR pathways of glioblastoma patients in the TCGA
  cohort (n = 140). (A) Log-transformed ssGSEA scores are represented for each DDR
  pathway; and after hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method), three distinct TCGA
  clusters were identified (TC1, TC2, and TC3). The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to
  compare ssGSEA scores of each pathway between clusters, with the same trend followed
  across all DDR pathways: TC1 < TC2 < TC3 (p < 0.01). MGMT methylation status and
  TP53 alterations (SNVs or homozygous deletions) are also depicted for respective
  patient samples. (B) Kaplan–Meier plots of OS are shown for patients within DDR
  clusters (TC1—red; TC2—yellow; TC3—green). The log-rank test was performed between
  each combination of clusters, revealing no significant OS differences between clusters.
  Statistical significance was determined with a p-value < 0.05.'
