caption: Characterization of koranimine biosynthetic gene cluster. (a) Comparison
  of koranimine biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) gene organization detected in Peribacillus
  frigoritolerans BE93 with that of Bacillus sp. NK2003. (b) Non-ribosomal peptide
  synthase (NRPS) domains and modules found in the BE93 koranimine BGC and the proposed
  pathway for the biosynthesis of koranimine.
