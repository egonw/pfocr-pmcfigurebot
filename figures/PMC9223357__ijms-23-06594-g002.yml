caption: 'Western blotting analysis of the levels of Survivin, XIAP, and P-gp in HL60R
  cells. The cells were treated for 24 h with different compounds. Relative protein
  level (mean ± standard error of three experiments). Differences when treatments
  are compared to the control: ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05; derivates versus precursors:
  ap < 0.05 (Survivin and XIAP), ap < 0.001 and bp < 0.05 (P-gp) (one-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s test).'
