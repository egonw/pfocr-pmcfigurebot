caption: Molecular model describing the potential action ANGPTL3 fibrinogen-like domain
  function. Possible intracellular pathways activated by ANGPTL3fld and interaction
  with the β-adrenergic signaling. ANGPTL3-mediated molecular pathways are shown in
  black. β-adrenergic downstream pathways are shown in red.
