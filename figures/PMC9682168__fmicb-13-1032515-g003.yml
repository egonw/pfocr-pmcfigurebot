caption: Metabolic reconstruction of relevant metabolic features and amino acid utilization
  in A. aminofermentans M3/9T. The metabolic reconstruction was performed with KEGG
  pathway maps represented in GenDB. The glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathways
  are highlighted in pink and green, respectively. Amino acids proposed to be utilized
  by A. aminofermentans M3/9T are written in green and corresponding transport systems
  are displayed in blue ovals. Metabolic pathways shown in the figure are completely
  encoded in the genome.
article_title: The novel oligopeptide utilizing species Anaeropeptidivorans aminofermentans
  M3/9T, its role in anaerobic digestion and occurrence as deduced from large-scale
  fragment recruitment analyses.
