  synapses
caption: AElectrical stimulation of descending afferents evoked excitatory postsynaptic
  currents (EPSCs) in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). EPSCs before (black)
  and after (red) application of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor IBMX (75 μM).BNormalized
  EPSC recordings. Shaded area indicates washin of IBMX, the PDE1 inhibitor MMPX (10 μM),
  the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (1 μM), the PDE10 inhibitor papaverine (10 μM), the
  PDE2 inhibitor BAY 66‐7550 (2 μM) or vehicle (DMSO, 0.002%). Mean ± SEM.CAveraged
  EPSCs during the 5‐min interval indicated in (B) ** P < 0.01, paired t‐test versus
  respective baseline, N = 5–8. Mean ± SEM.DCheRiff was expressed in either cortical
  area M1 or the thalamic parafascicular nucleus (one area injected per mouse) and
  blue light flashes were used to evoke cortical or thalamic EPSCs. Example traces
  show response before (black) and after IBMX (red).EOptically evoked EPSCs (oEPSCs)
  from cortical (magenta) or thalamic inputs (green). Shaded area is washin of IBMX.
  Mean ± SEM.FAveraged normalized EPSCs during the interval indicated in (E). P = 0.98,
  unpaired t‐test, N = 11 and 6.GCortical oEPSCs recorded from GFP‐labeled, Cre‐positive
  indirect pathway (iSPNs), and tdTomato‐labeled Cre‐negative direct pathway SPNs
  (dSPNs). Scale bar 100 μm.HNormalized oEPSCs in dSPNs and iSPNs. Shaded area indicates
  washin of IBMX. Mean ± SEM.IAveraged responses during the interval marked in (H).
  P = 0.23, unpaired t‐test, dSPNs versus iSPNs N = 5 and 6.
