caption: Ileal microbiota-associated metabolism is impaired due to ischemic stroke(A)
  Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of metabolite features identified by positive
  and negative ionizations in ileal contents of poststroke and sham-operated mice
  1 day after surgery (n = 5/group).(B) Metabolic pathway analysis of metabolites
  with significantly differing intensity between stroke and sham mice. The overlapped
  size indicates the number of significant metabolic features mapped to corresponding
  pathways.(C) Heatmap showing differentially enriched metabolites.
