caption: 'MBL prompts HSC senescence via the p53/p21 pathway. LX-2 cells were treated
  with PFT-α (10 μmol/L) 2 hours before the incubation of MBL and H2O2. (A) Representative
  photomicrographs of the SA–β-gal staining of LX-2 cells treated with PFT before
  the incubation of MBL. (B) The distribution of cell cycle on the treated LX-2 cells
  with flow cytometry analysis. (C) The p53 and p21 protein levels were assessed by
  Western blot analysis. (D) The mRNA levels of senescence-related genes were assessed
  by quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis. (E) The mRNA levels of
  fibrosis-associated genes were assessed by qRT-PCR analysis. Scale bars: 100 μm.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM. ∗∗P < .01, 1-way analysis of variance followed
  by Tukey post hoc tests for multiple group comparisons. The data shown represent
  3 independent experiments. CXCL, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand; HPF, high-power
  field; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP1, tissue inhibitors
  of metalloproteinase 1.'
