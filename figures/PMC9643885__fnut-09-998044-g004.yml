caption: 'Metabolic effects induced by overfeeding and polyphenol administration.
  (A) Metabolite correlation matrix obtained from the plasma metabolome analysis of
  the male “Lyon” study across all time points for all subjects for the placebo arm
  (overfeeding), and (B), for the polyphenol arm (overfeeding and polyphenol administration).
  Non-significant correlations (p-value > 0.05) were excluded. (C) metabolic pathways
  involved in diet-induced obesity, as observed in this study by plasma metabolomics:
  a profile with elevated circulating branched chain amino acids, BCAA (valine, isoleucine
  and leucine) and branched chain keto acids, BCKA (α-keto-isovalerate, α-keto-β-methylvalerate,
  and α-keto-isocaproate) highlighting increased BCAA catabolism, leading to decreased
  TCA cycle activity (lower levels of citrate) and ketogenesis (lower levels of ketone
  bodies acetone, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybuturate), with an increased gluconeogenesis
  (higher levels of glucose) and lactate production through the Cahill cycle. Monitored
  metabolites are in bold. Pathway names are in gray.'
