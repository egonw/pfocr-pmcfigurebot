caption: Resveratrol (RSV) increases NGFR by enhancing the stability of mRNA and protein.
  Cells were treated with or without 80 μM RSV for 48 h. (A) Protein expression of
  NGFR as determined by Western blot. ACTB was used as an internal control; (B) Transcriptional
  expression of NGFR as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB was used as an internal control;
  (C) Lifespan of NGFR mRNA as determined by qRT-PCR in cells incubated with actinomycin
  D for 0, 3, or 6 h after RSV treatment. ACTB was used as an internal control; (D)
  Lifespan of NGFR protein as determined by Western blot in cells incubated with cycloheximide
  for 0, 4, 8, or 12 h after RSV treatment. ACTB was used as an internal control.
  The data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group.
