caption: FGF11 is up-regulated in platinum-resistant OCCC tissues and associated with
  poor prognosis. (A) The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the platinum-resistant
  group compared to the platinum-sensitive group. (B) The distribution of pathways
  of DEGs based on the gene set defined by the PanCancer Pathways Panel. (C) Out of
  the PI3K pathway, the MAPK pathway, and the Cell Cycle-Apoptosis pathway, eight
  genes have been involved in two or all of them. (D) The mRNA expression level of
  FGF11 in ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues from the TCGA and GTEx databases.
  (E) Kaplan-Meier survival curve for overall survival (HR=1.33, 95% CI 1.08–1.64,
  P=0.0061). (F) Kaplan-Meier survival curve for progression-free survival (HR=1.65,
  95% CI 1.3–2.08, P=2.3e-05). ***, P < 0.001.
