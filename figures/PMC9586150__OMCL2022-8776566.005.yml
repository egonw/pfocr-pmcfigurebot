caption: PMSN analysis. (a) The construction of the PMSN network. Orange represents
  the KEGG pathway; blue represents miRNA. The node size represents the degree of
  connectivity, and larger nodes indicate higher connectivity. The red circle indicates
  that the miRNA had no SNP site. The connecting line between miRNA and pathways indicates
  that there is a relationship between the miRNA and the pathway, and a red connecting
  line indicates that the miRNA target gene has SNPs. The thickness of the connecting
  line represents the adjusted P value. (b) The histogram shows the top 10 pathways.
  (c) Histogram of the distribution of pathway connectivity. (d) Histogram of the
  top 10 miRNAs in terms of degree of connectivity. (e) Histogram of the distribution
  of miRNAs.
