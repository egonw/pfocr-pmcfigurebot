caption: 'The characteristics and function of circRNA-0044301 on cells in vitro and
  in vivo. (A) FISH assay to detect the subcellular localization of circRNA-0044301
  in HGC-27 and MKN-28 (The samples were imaged at 60× magnification). (B) RNase R
  treatment to determine the circular nature of circRNA-0044301 in GC cell lines.
  (C) Actinomycin D assay to explore the half-life of circRNA-0044301 and linear RNA
  in HGC-27 and MKN-28. (D) CCK-8 assay for the viability of HGC-27 cells (top) and
  MKN-28 cells (bottom) in the si-circRNA-0044301 group and nc-circRNA-0044301 group
  (***: p < 0.001; **: p < 0.01; *: p < 0.05; ns: no difference). (E) Wound healing
  assay for the cell migration ability of GC cells after circRNA-0044301 knockdown
  over time (0 h and 24 h), and the percentage of wound closure was statistically
  analyzed (The samples were imaged at 100× magnification. Scale bar = 100 μm). (F)
  Results of the Transwell assay of HGC-27 cells (top) and MKN-28 cells (bottom) transfected
  with si-circRNA-0044301 and nc-circRNA-0044301 (the samples were imaged at 200×
  magnification. Scale bar = 50 μm). (G) Subcutaneous tumorigenesis model, specific
  siRNA transfection was adopted to reduce circRNA-0044301 levels in tumors. (H) The
  size of tumor volume was measured in vivo every 2–3 days using Vernier caliper (*:
  p < 0.05; ns: no difference); (I) IHC assay demonstrated the level of Ki67 in control
  siRNA and specific siRNA-treated groups (**: p < 0.01).'
