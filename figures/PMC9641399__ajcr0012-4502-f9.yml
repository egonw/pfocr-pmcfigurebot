caption: 'IVM inhibited HCT-8 cells migration through suppressing Wnt/β-catenin/integrin
  β1/FAK signaling pathway. A. Wound healing assay was carried out at 0 h and 24 h,
  respectively, after the cells were treated with or without 6 μM IVM in the presence
  or absence of 200 ng/ml Wnt3a. Scale bar = 250 μm. B. Quantitation of scratch assay
  as described in . C. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin/integrin β1/FAK pathway and
  the expression of their downstream signaling molecules in the cells treated with
  6 μM IVM and/or 25 nM VCR in the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml Wnt3a for 48 h.
  Data in the histograms were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). **P < 0.01, compared
  with their respective controls; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with the corresponding
  columns with the same color.'
