caption: 'MLT attenuated lipogenesis in LPS-stimulated HMGECs. The HMGECs were treated
  with MLT for 48 hours followed by LPS for 24 hours. (A) Images of lipid droplets
  in HMGECs detected by LipidTox staining. Scale bar: 50 µm. (B) Densitometric analysis
  and quantification of lipid droplets (n = 3). (C) Representative protein bands of
  ADFP, ELOVL4, and SREBP-1. (D–F) Relative intensity of ADFP (D), ELOVL4 (E), and
  SREBP-1 (F) (n = 4). *Significantly different from control, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001. #Significantly different from LPS group, #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001.'
