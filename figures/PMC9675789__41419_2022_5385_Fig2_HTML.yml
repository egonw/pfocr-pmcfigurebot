figure_title: Cisplatin-induced dormant and reactivated lung cancer cells show distinct
  gene expression profiles
caption: The differential gene expression profiles were evaluated by RNA-seq. The
  DEGs were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis between dormant cancer cells
  and untreated cancer cells (A); between reactivated cancer cells and dormant cancer
  cells (B); C The heatmap of the expression of significant genes in cell cycle, EMT
  et al. between 3 cell phases induced by cisplatin; D GSEA analysis of differentially
  expressed genes. Gene set enrichment analysis using “GSEA, KERLEY_RESPONSE_TO_CISPLATIN_UP”
  was performed. P value < 0.001. The NES and FDR were shown. E The heatmap of the
  expression of significant genes in cisplatin-resistance between 3 cell phases induced
  by cisplatin.
