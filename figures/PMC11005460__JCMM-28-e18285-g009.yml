caption: Engeletin suppresses LCN2/CXCL10 signalling activity in the medial prefrontal
  cortex (mPFC). (A, B) Partial heatmaps and volcano plots highlighting differences
  in gene expression between the CSDS and engeletin groups (|log2FC|>1, difference>2
  fold), with blue and red respectively indicating downregulated and upregulated genes
  (n = 3). (C, D) quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) analyses of changes in LCN2
  and CXCL10 expression in the CON, CSDS, and engeletin groups (n = 5). (E–G) Representative
  western blotting (E) and corresponding quantification (F, G) of LCN2 and CXCL10
  expression in the mPFC (n = 5). Results are means ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ****p < 0.0001, one‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc testing. CSDS, chronic stress
  social defeat stress.

  polarization via the LCN2/CXCL10 signalling pathway.
