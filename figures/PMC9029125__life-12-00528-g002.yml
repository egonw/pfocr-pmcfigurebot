caption: 'Schematic representation of two signaling pathways involved in FHL2 transcription
  regulation. Right-hand side: Schematic diagram of dexamethasone-induced FHL2 transcription
  and subsequent activation cascades (adapted from Langenbah and Handschel 2013 []).
  Left-hand side (frame): Signalling pathway leading to the synthesis of FHL2 by mechano-transduction.
  The FAK would play a key role by activating two transduction signalling pathways
  that regulate Sp1 (PI3K/AKT, Src/ERK pathways). Sp1 would bind to a KLF8 promoter
  to initiate KLF8 transcription and KLF8 would initiate the transcription of FHL2
  by binding to its promoter.'
