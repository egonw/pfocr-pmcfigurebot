caption: The exosomes from different tissues and their mechanisms that promote osteogenesis
  and promote angiogenesis ① SMSC‐derived exosomes can enhance the proliferation and
  anti‐apoptotic capacity of BMSC; ② hiPSC‐MSC‐derived exosomes promote angiogenesis
  by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in vascular endothelial cells; ③ Platelet‐rich
  plasma‐derived exosomes enhance osteobinin expression levels through the Wnt/‐catenin
  signaling pathway; ④ BMSC‐derived exosomes containing downregulated levels of miR‐224‐3p
  can promote the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells; ⑤ miR‐26a‐CD34+ exosomes
  can promote angiogenesis and promote osteogenesis; Normal conditional exosomes (NOR‐exos)
  promote the osteogenic differentiation of the MSC through activating the CD41/integrin
  β3‐FAK‐PI3K/Akt‐Runx2 pathway
