caption: CRLS1 p.(Ile109Asn) cells display an ER-driven gene expression stress response.
  Fold enrichment of (A) KEGG pathways and (B) biological process and cellular compartment
  gene ontologies determined by quantitative whole-cell proteomics performed on controls
  and Subject 1 fibroblasts. Significance of pathway enrichment determined at FDR < 0.01.
  Data are from five independent biological samples. (C) Transmission electron micrographs
  of control and patient fibroblast endoplasmic reticulum. Scale bar is 200 nm and
  arrows indicate hypertrophic ER morphology.
article_title: Deleterious variants in CRLS1 lead to cardiolipin deficiency and cause
  an autosomal recessive multi-system mitochondrial disease.
