caption: 'Class Ⅲ PRTase in the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway regulates plant growth,
  development, and abiotic stress response. Class Ⅲ PRTase AnPRT controls the biosynthesis
  of Try to regulate the level of IAA. Under nutrient-adequate conditions, moderate
  levels of IAA promote ARFs expression and TMK1-mediated TOR activation to promote
  chloroplast development and plant growth. However, under nutrient-limiting conditions,
  elevated levels of IAA mediate C-terminal cleavage of TMK1 to repress the expression
  of ARFs and activate ABA signaling, thus activating SnRK1 and inactivating TOR to
  promote plant abiotic stress responses. AnPRT is represented by a square box, and
  other proteins are represented by round boxes. Solid arrows indicate direct interactions
  or one-step reactions, and dashed arrows indicate indirect interactions, multistep
  reactions, or transmembrane transport. Abbreviations for proteins are as follows:
  pin-formed 2 (PIN2), transmembrane kinase 1 (TMK1), rho-related protein in plant
  2 (ROP2), target of rapamycin (TOR), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), Toll–interleukin
  1 receptor (TIR), auxin response factor (ARF), anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (AnPRT), auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1), sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein
  kinase 1 (SnRK1), protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), sucrose non-fermenting 1-related
  protein kinase 2 (SnRK2). Abbreviations for metabolites are shown in the Abbreviations
  list.'
