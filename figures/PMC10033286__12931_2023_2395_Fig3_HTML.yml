caption: RNA sequencing of in vitro cultured ILC3s with or without IL-1β + IL-23 stimulation.
  A Volcano plots of differential expression genes (DEGs) in ILC3s stimulated by IL-1β + IL-23.
  The top five differential expressed genes were IL-22, CCR7, IGFBP4, CD22 and CXCL8.
  B Heatmap analysis of effector cytokines in ILC3s. In the heatmap, the redder the
  color is, the higher the expression is, and the greener the expression is, the lower
  the expression is. C Function terms of DEGs by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
  and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in ILC3s upon IL-1β + IL-23(50 ng/mL) stimulation.
  D Heatmap analysis of DEGs in inflammation response. E The clustering heat map of
  DEGs involved in NF-κB signal pathway. F, G Western blot analysis by antiphospho-p65
  Ab, antiphospho-p38 Ab, antiphospho-JNK Ab and antiphospho-Erk Ab. Cell extracts
  were prepared after stimulation with IL-1β (50 ng/mL) for indicated times. H Phosphorylation
  and inhibition of p65, p38 and JNK by specific inhibitors in ILC3s. Western blot
  analysis of p-p65, p-p38 and p-JNK were performed with cell extracts from ILC3s,
  preincubated for 1 h with p65 NF-κB inhibitor TPCA-1, p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580
  or JNK-MAPK inhibitor SP600125 and then stimulated with IL-1β (50 ng/mL) for 10 min.
  I Expression of CXCL8 protein in culture supernatant of ILC3 cells after IL-1β stimulation
  with or without corresponding inhibitors. ILC3s were preincubated for 1 h with indicated
  inhibitors and then stimulated with IL-1β (50 ng/mL) for 24 h
