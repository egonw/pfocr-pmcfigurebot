caption: Expression profiles of SmEIL1 gene and the genes involved in the tanshinones
  biosynthesis pathway in response to the treatment with ethylene. (A) The expression
  profiles of SmEIL1 gene after the induction of ethylene. (B) Expression profiles
  of genes in the tanshinones biosynthesis pathway after treatment with ethylene.
  Fold changes of the relative gene expression level were all normalized to the 0
  h treatment. The error line indicates the error for three biological replicates;
  t-test was done for significant differences (**P< 0.01; *P< 0.05).
