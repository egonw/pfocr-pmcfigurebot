caption: Copper inactivates RSEs in vitro and in vivo. (A) Purified HemN, viperin,
  and fumarase A were exposed to 100 μM of Cu(I) or Ag(I) for 5 min anoxically at
  RT and then assayed for SAM-cleavage activity (n = 3). See  for time courses. (B)
  The LEM33 strain lacking copper-efflux systems (ΔcopA ΔcueO Δcus) was cultured in
  glucose medium to which copper (20 μM, red curves) was added at time zero. Lipoate,
  biotin, and thiamine were supplied as indicated (+Vit). The medium contained branched-chain
  amino acids to compensate for copper-mediated damage to that biosynthetic pathway.
  See  for further quantitation (n = 3). (For interpretation of the references to
  colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)
