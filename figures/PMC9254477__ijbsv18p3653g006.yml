caption: 'Identification of the PC-NVs/Lcn2 signaling pathway responsible for promoting
  neurovascular regeneration. (A) Heatmap of log2-normalized intensities of DEGs from
  age-matched controls (C) and diabetic mice, determined 2 weeks after intracavernous
  injections of HBS, shCon-PC-NVs (5 μg/20 μl) or Lcn2-KD-PC-NVs (5 μg/20 μl) on days
  -3 and 0. Color density expressed fold-change magnitude in the indicated multiples.
  Red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated. (B) Protein-protein interaction network
  of DEGs. The line thickness corresponds to the interaction strength between protein
  (C) Representative Western blots for MAPK, PI3K, Akt, and Trp53 in cavernous tissue
  from age-matched control (C) and diabetic mice, 2 weeks after intracavernous injections
  of HBS, shCon-PC-NVs (5 μg/20 μl) or Lcn2-KD-PC-NVs (5 μg/20 μl) on days -3 and
  0. (D-G) Band intensities of each protein normalized to the density of β-actin,
  quantified using Image J and presented as means ± SEM (n = 4; *P < 0.05; #P < 0.001).
  DM, diabetes mellitus; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline.'
