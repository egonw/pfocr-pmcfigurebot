caption: A) Fold-change for genes in the KEGG Apoptosis pathway (hsa04210) that are
  present within ISG modules from RNAseq data in . B-D) IEC ileum organoids from subject
  008 were treated for 4 hours with PBS, IFN-I, IFN-II, or IFN-III, followed by treatment
  with PBS or TNFα for 20 hours. B) Representative flow cytometry plots of organoids
  subjected to the indicated conditions and stained with a caspase 3/7 reporter and
  “live/DEAD” cell permeability dye. C) Representative histograms showing the median
  fluorescence intensity (MFI) of caspase 3/7 activity reporter among intact IECs
  (negative for live/DEAD dye) in response to the indicated treatments. D) Mean fold-change
  in caspase 3/7 reporter fluorescence relative to untreated organoids from four independent
  experiments (subjects 005 and 008) with error bars indicating SEM. Statistical significance
  determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. * = p<0.05.
