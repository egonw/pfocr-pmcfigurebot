caption: Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) Involved in
  the Metabolic Pathways Altered in Treated Leaves and Stems via the KEGG Database.
  (A,B), two charts show enriched metabolisms altered in treated leaves (C-Y) (A)
  and stems (C-J) (B). The KEGG enrichment bubble diagrams indicate that the top 20
  enriched metabolisms with the smallest Q value. The ordinate includes plant metabolisms.
  The abscissa is the enrichment factor (the number of DEGs in the pathway divided
  by all the numbers in the pathway). Bubble size indicates the quantity. The color
  code from blue to red indicates the trend from the biggest to smallest Q values.
