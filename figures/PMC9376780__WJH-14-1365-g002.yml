caption: 'Lipid-laden hepatocytes induce macrophage M1 polarization and inflammation
  via IL-1β signaling. Primary hepatocytes were incubated with free fatty acids for
  6 h for RT–PCR or 24 h for western blot and ELISA. Cell culture supernatants of
  hepatocytes were collected and prepared for different conditioned mediums (CMs).
  RAW264.7 macrophages were pretreated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and
  treated with different CMs for 6 h for RT–PCR or 24 h for western blotting. A: mRNA
  expression of Il-1β in primary hepatocytes; B: Protein expression of IL-1β in primary
  hepatocytes; C: IL-1β production in the hepatocyte culture supernatant; D: mRNA
  expression of Il-1β in macrophages; E: mRNA expression of M1/M2 markers in macrophages;
  F: Protein expression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in macrophages. Values are expressed
  as the mean ± SE of the mean, aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01 vs normal control (NC) or CM-NC;
  cP < 0.05, dP < 0.01 comparison of the designated two groups, n = 3 experiments.
  NC: Normal control; CM: Conditioned medium; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  IL-1Ra: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; Nos: Nitric oxide synthase; Tnf: Tumor
  necrosis factor; Il: Interleukin; Arg1: Arginine-1; Mrc2: Mannose receptor 2; TLR4:
  Toll-like receptor 4; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa-B; IκBα: Inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa-B.'
