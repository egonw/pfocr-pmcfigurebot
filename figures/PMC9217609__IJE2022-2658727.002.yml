caption: '(a) Western blot verified the expression level of TET3 was decreased with
  shTET3 intervention in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells; (b) the results of immunofluorescence
  showed that inhibiting the expression of TET3 significantly decreased the 5hmC level
  of papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines BCPAP and TPC-1. Upper panel: 5hmC staining
  (green); lower panel: DAPI staining (blue), superimposed with 5hmC staining; (c)
  CCK-8 assays and (d) colony formation assays showed that TET3 knockdown significantly
  suppressed cell proliferation in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells.'
