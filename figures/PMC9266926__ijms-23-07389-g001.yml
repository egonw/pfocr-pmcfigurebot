caption: Long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is an arrhythmia disorder that sometimes causes a
  prolongation in the QT interval as measured on an electrocardiogram (ECG). (A).
  The left diagram shows a cross section of the heart illustrating the cardiac conduction
  pathway in the atrial and ventricles. The electrical activation of the heart (arrows)
  is measured using electrocardiography. The right image shows an ECG trace for a
  single cardiac cycle. The depolarization of the atria generates the P-wave, the
  depolarization of the ventricle generates the QRS complex, and the repolarization
  of the ventricle generates the T-wave. The QT-interval changes as a function of
  the heart rate (as measured by the RR-interval). (A) Prolongation in the heart rate-corrected
  QT-interval is a biomarker for an increased risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
  Torsade de pointes. (B). Diagram of an ECG trace showing a typical Torsade de pointes
  arrhythmia. Torsade results in a loss in cardiac output and can cause syncope, seizures,
  and sudden cardiac death.
