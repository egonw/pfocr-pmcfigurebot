caption: Anlo elevated PDL1 expression of human CRC cell lines in a concentration-dependent
  manner. (a) mRNA expression levels of PDL1 in HCT-116 and RKO cells treated with
  PBS, 2.5, and 5 μM/mL anlo. (b) Protein expression levels of PDL1 in HCT-116 and
  RKO cells were proved by western blots and the quantification of the blotting results.
