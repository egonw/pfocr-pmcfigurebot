caption: NF-κB activation, AKT1 overexpression or p21 knockdown partially reverses
  the effects of ST2825 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. (A and B) Flow
  cytometric analysis in the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assay to determine the ratio
  of apoptotic PANC-1 cells following ST2825 treatment combined with IL-1α. (C and
  D) Flow cytometric analysis in the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assay to determine
  the apoptotic ratio of PANC-1 cells following ST2825 treatment combined with control
  or AKT1 plasmids. (E and F) Flow cytometric analysis in the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis
  assay to determine the ratio of apoptotic PANC-1 cells following ST2825 treatment
  combined with control or p21 siRNAs. (G-I) Western blot analysis was used to determine
  the changes in expression of related proteins in PANC-1 cells of the groups mentioned
  in panels A, C and E. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. The t-test and Bonferroni test were used for statistical
  analysis, *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. NC, negative control; ST, ST2825.

  by suppressing the activation of the NF‑κB/AKT1/p21 pathway in pancreatic cancer.
