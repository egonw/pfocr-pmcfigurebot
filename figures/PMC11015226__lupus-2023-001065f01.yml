caption: Overall schematics for screening of candidate lncRNAs. (1) WGCNA was applied
  to high-throughput SLE B-cell transcriptome data (GSE164457) to construction networks
  with co-expressed genes in the same module. Gene modules were linked to disease
  phenotypes and the most clinically relevant module was selected to do an enrichment
  analysis. (2) B cell RNA-seq data (E-GEAD-397) were analysed. LncRNA RP11-273G15.2
  was in the critical module and differentially expressed between HCs and SLE. (3)
  Distribution of RP11-273G15.2 was investigated at a single-cell level (GSE163121).
  (4) Real-time PCR was used to validate the potential of RP11-273G15.2 as a biomarker
  in an independent cohort. HCs, healthy control; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus;
  WGCNA, weighted gene coexpression network analysis.
