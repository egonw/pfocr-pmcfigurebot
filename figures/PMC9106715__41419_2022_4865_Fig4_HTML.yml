figure_title: RP1-59D14.5 affects PCa cell progression via targeting LATS1/LATS2/miR-147a
caption: A, B Colony formation and EdU assays assessed the proliferation of the indicated
  transfected cells. Scale bar = 50 μm C Transwell assays detected the invasion and
  migration of the indicated transfected cells. Scale bar = 10 μm. D The dots of GFP
  and mRFP in differently transfected cells were detected by IF analysis and quantified
  by RT-qPCR. Scale bar = 10 μm. E Western blot measured the protein levels of p62,
  LAMP1, LC3-I/II. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
