caption: RNA-seq identifies gene transcriptional changes and signaling pathways in
  LSCs treated with ILC1s or IFN-γ. a, Experimental design for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).
  Mouse LSCs were sorted and treated with or without sorted ILC1s or IFN-γ for 3 days.
  LSCs were resorted from co-cultured ILC1s or IFN-γ using FACS before RNA-Seq. b,
  Purity of LSCs (left) and ILC1s (right) after cell sorting. c, Heat map showing
  differential expression of RNA of 627 genes (n = 3 individual mice). d-f, Volcano
  plots showing significantly differentially expressed genes in RNA pools from AML
  LSCs treated with ILC1s vs. Ctrl (untreated) (d), IFN-γ vs. Ctrl (e), and IFN-γ
  vs. ILC1s (f) (n = 3 individual mice). g, Hallmark pathway analysis in LSC RNA pools
  (IFN-γ vs. Ctrl). The left panel shows signaling pathways downregulated in LSCs.
  The right panel shows signaling pathways upregulated in LSCs (n = 3 individual mice).
  Genes with an FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.7
  were considered as significantly upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively.
