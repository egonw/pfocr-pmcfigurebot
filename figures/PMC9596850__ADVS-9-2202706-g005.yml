caption: 'Salivaricins inhibit IL‐6R/IL‐21R‐STAT3 signaling pathway. A–C) Volcano
  plots of genes upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) for 1.5‐fold or more in
  Tfh‐like relative to Th0 cells (A) or salivaricin‐treated relative to vehicle‐treated
  Tfh‐like cells (B,C) assessed by RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) analyses. n = 5‐6; SalA2
  = 50 µg mL−1; SalB = 50 µg mL−1. D,E) Venn diagrams showing the overlaps of gene
  profiles regulated between the salivaricin‐treated and vehicle‐treated Tfh‐like
  cells. sal‐regulated: differentially expressed genes between salivaricin‐treated
  and vehicle‐treated Tfh‐like cells; Tfh‐like‐associated: differentially expressed
  genes between Tfh‐like and Th0 cells. F) Assessment of phosphorylation level of
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by western blot in Tfh‐like
  cells with or without salivaricin‐treatment. n = 3. G–J) Assessment of the expressions
  of Cxcr5, Bcl6, and il21 (qPCR, (G–I)) and the IL‐21 level (ELISA, (J)) in Tfh‐like
  cells. SalA2 = 50 µg mL−1; SalB = 50 µg mL−1; anti‐IL6R = 50 µg mL−1; anti‐IL21R
  = 50 µg mL−1. n = 10. K) IL‐21 level (ELISA) in Th17 cells. n = 7–9. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± sem. Significance is assessed using one‐way ANOVA followed by Holm‐Sidak''s
  multiple comparisons tests (B–F). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
