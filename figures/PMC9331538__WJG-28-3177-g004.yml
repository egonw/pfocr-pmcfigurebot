caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide increases mRNA levels of Met in HCT116
  cells. Colon cancer cells were exposed to parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP)
  for 15 min, followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect Met
  mRNA levels as described in Materials and Methods to evaluate whether PTHrP modulates
  Met mRNA levels in HCT116 cells. Graph bars represent the average of the results
  obtained from three independent experiments. GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide. aP
  < 0.05.'

  cancer cells induced by parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
