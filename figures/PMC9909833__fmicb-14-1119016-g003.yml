caption: Pronounced transcription changes at the early stage of inoculation in gmsweet15
  mutant. (A) Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  in RNA-seq. DEGs were identified using adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and |log2[FoldChange]| ≥ 1
  as the threshold for the significance of the gene expression difference. See  for
  gene expression data. (B) Statistical analysis of upregulated and downregulated
  DEGs in response to S. sclerotiorum infection and comparison between WT and gmsweet15
  mutant. (C,D) Volcano plot of the distribution of DEGs in response to (Continued)FIGURE
  3 (Continued)S. sclerotiorum 24 hpi in WT (C) and gmsweet15 mutant (D). The X-axis
  represents the change in gene expression in different samples, here represented
  by log2[FoldChange] value. The Y-axis indicates the statistical significance of
  changes in gene expression levels, here represented by-log10 (padj) value. The dots
  represent different genes. The blue dots represent genes with no significant difference,
  the red dots represent genes with significant differences in upregulation, and the
  green dots represent genes with significant differences in downregulation. (E,F)
  Significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process terms in the upregulated
  (E) and downregulated (F) DEGs in WT_24 h vs. WT_0 h. (G,H) Significantly enriched
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in the upregulated (G) and
  downregulated (H) DEGs in WT_24 h vs. WT_0 h. (I,J) DEGs of significantly enriched
  MAPK signaling pathway-plant pathway (I) and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway
  (J) in WT_24 h vs. WT_0 h. The ruler is the largest log2[FoldChange] value of all
  the differentially annotated genes into this pathway. Red indicates that the genes
  annotated to the pathway are upregulated, and green indicates that the genes annotated
  to the pathway are downregulated. (K,L) Significantly enriched GO biological process
  terms in the upregulated (K) and downregulated (L) DEGs in gmsweet15_24 h vs. gmsweet15_0
  h. (M,N) Significantly enriched KEGG pathways in the upregulated (M) and downregulated
  (N) DEGs in gmsweet15_24 h vs. gmsweet15_0 h. (O) Box plots showing expression level
  (z-score) related to defense response in global gene. Box plots with boxes displaying
  the 25th–75th percentiles, the center line indicating the median. All individual
  data points are overlaid. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001) according to a two-tailed
  comparisons t-test. In E-N, the adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 is used as the threshold
  of significant enrichment in GO and KEGG enrichment. For expression data and full
  GO or KEGG lists, see .
