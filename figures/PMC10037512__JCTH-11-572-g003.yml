caption: Transcriptome sequencing and functional enrichment analysis of the vector
  and OE-STX5 groups. (A) Heatmap showing the DEGs in the OE-STX5 and vector groups.
  DEGs with similar expression patterns are grouped. Differences in the color of two
  squares in each row reflects differences in gene expression. (B) Red dots on the
  volcano plot represent upregulated genes. Green dots represent downregulated genes
  in the OE-STX5 group compared with the vector group. (C-F) Results of enrichment
  analyses of the DEGs between the OE-STX5 and vector groups, i.e. biological process,
  cellular component, molecular function, KEGG pathway, and DisGeNET enrichment analyses.
  (G) A positive association between STX5 expression and the MTOR signaling pathway
  in HCC was demonstrated by GSEA. (H-I) Western blot assays of p-PI3K, p-mTOR, and
  mTOR protein levels in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells transduced with LV-shSTX5 and LV-NC
  and in MHCC97H cells transfected with OE-STX5 and the vector for 24 h. Data are
  means Â± SD of three independent assays. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
