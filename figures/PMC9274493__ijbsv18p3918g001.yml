caption: 'DDX3 was down-regulated in advanced CRC tissues and low expression of DDX3
  in CRC was associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. (A) Expression of DDX3
  mRNA in normal and CRC tissues by the Oncomine database from the GEO dataset. ***P<0.001
  via Student''s t-test. (B) Protein expression of DDX3 in 4 clinical stages of CRC
  by the CPTAC database. *P<0.05 vs Stage IV, ns P>0.05 vs Stage IV via Student''s
  t-test. (C) Effects of DDX3 protein expression on overall survival by The Human
  Protein Atlas. (D) Effects of DDX3 mRNA expression on overall survival, event-free
  survival and relapse-free survival by the R2 database. (E) Expression differences
  of DDX3 in age, AJCC stage and metastasis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 via Pearson''s chi-square
  test. (F) IHC staining scores of DDX3 in 4 AJCC stage of CRC. *P<0.05 vs Stage IV,
  **P<0.01 vs IV via Student''s t-test. (G) Effects of DDX3 protein expression on
  overall survival by CRC TMA analysis. Abbreviation: AJCC, the American Joint Committee
  on Cancer; CPTAC, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium; CRC, colorectal
  cancer; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus; IHC, immunohistochemistry; TMA, tissue microarray.'
