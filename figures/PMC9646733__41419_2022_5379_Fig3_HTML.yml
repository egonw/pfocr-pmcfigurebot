figure_title: RHBDL2 promotes proliferation and mobility of PC cells by activating
  the Notch signaling pathway
caption: 'A The result of RNA-seq analysis. B, C qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses
  of RHBDL2, HES1, HEY1, ZEB1, MMP9, SNAIL1, and TWIST1 in the indicated PC cells.
  D Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay. CCK-8 (E), colony formation (F), and EdU (scale
  bar: 50 μm) (G) assays of the PC cells incubated with/without IMR-1 (the inhibitor
  of Notch signaling pathway). Wound healing (scale bar: 100 μm) (H) and Transwell
  (scale bar: 50 μm) (I) assays of the indicated PC cells incubated with/without IMR-1.
  J, K qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses of HES1, HEY1, ZEB1, MMP9, SNAIL1, and TWIST1
  in the indicated PC cells incubated with/without IMR-1. (L) Dual Luciferase Reporter
  Assay of the indicated PC cells incubated with/without IMR-1. *P < 0.05.'
