caption: The effects of compounds 1 and 5 on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in
  RKO cells. (A) Expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, c-Myc and GSK-3β proteins were
  determined by Western blotting after cells were treated with 10, 20 and 40 μM for
  48 h, respectively. (B,C) Statistics of Western blotting results. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared with control groups.
