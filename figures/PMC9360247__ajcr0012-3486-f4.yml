caption: The overexpression of AKT1ca gene decreased Econazole-induced apoptosis in
  MDR breast cancer cell lines. A. AKT1ca overexpression decreased Econazole-induced
  decreases of P-gp and Bcl-2 protein levels in two ADR breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231/ADR
  and MCF-7/ADR), as measured by Western blotting. P-GSK3β (S9) was used as a positive
  control because it is phosphorylated by AKT. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  B. AKT1ca overexpression significantly decreased the Econazole-induced loss of cell
  viability in MDA-MB-231/ADR, as measured by MTT assays at 72 hours (P<0.05). C.
  AKT1ca overexpression significantly decreased the Econazole-induced loss of cell
  viability in MCF-7/ADR, as measured by MTT assays at 72 hours (P<0.05). D. AKT1ca
  overexpression significantly decreased Econazole-induced (3 μM) apoptosis in both
  MDA-MB-231/ADR and MCF-7/ADR cells at 24 hours. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin
  V/PI staining and flow cytometry. E. The quantitative results of D (P<0.05).
