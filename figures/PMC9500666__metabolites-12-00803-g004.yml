caption: GO enrichment analysis and verification of the different NEFA treatment−activated
  genes. (A) Bubble plot of GO enrichment analysis. (B) Thermogram analysis of expressions
  (log10(FPKM+1)) of 7 target genes. (C) qPCR verification of expression modes of
  7 target genes. (D) Protein expression of ATF4 and CHOP(DDIT3) in BMECs stimulated
  with NEFA for 6 h. (E) Protein and protein interaction network of CHOP(DDIT3) and
  ATF4. Data are presented as the means ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of
  three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01.
