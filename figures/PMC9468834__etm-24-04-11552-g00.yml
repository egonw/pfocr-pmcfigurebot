caption: Time- and dose-dependent expression of inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells
  induced by IL-1β. ELISA was used to detect protein expression levels of supernatant
  inflammatory cytokines (A) IL-6, (B) IL-1β, (C) TNF-α and chemokines (D) IP-10 in
  Caco-2 cells incubated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for different time. The protein expression
  of (E) IL-6, (F) IL-1β, (G) TNF-α and (H) IP-10 in Caco-2 cells incubated with different
  concentration IL-1β for 3 h via ELISA. *Ρ<0.05, **Ρ<0.01, ***Ρ<0.001, ****Ρ<0.0001
  vs. 0 h or 0 ng/ml.

  response via downregulation of the IRAK1/TRAF6 signaling pathway in human intestinal
  epithelial cells.
