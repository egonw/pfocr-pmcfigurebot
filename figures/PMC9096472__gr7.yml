caption: 'Combination therapy of OVV with trametinib diminishes tumor growth in the
  A2780-R cell-derived xenograft model(A) BALB/c-nu/nu mice were subcutaneously transplanted
  with A2780-R cells on day −12, intraperitoneally injected vehicle (0.4% DMSO) or
  trametinib (0.5 mg/kg) daily from day −1 to day 6, and intratumorally injected with
  vaccinia virus (1 × 106 PFU) on day 0. (B) Representative images of the xenograft
  mice (left side) and tumor tissues (right side). (C) Effects of the combined treatment
  with trametinib and OVV on in vivo tumor growth of A2780-R cells. Tumor volume was
  determined from day 0 to day 24. (D) The tumor tissues were isolated from the xenograft
  mice on day 24 for measurement of the tumor weights. Data are represented as mean ±
  SEM. ∗p < 0.05; #p < 0.01; ‡p < 0.001.'
