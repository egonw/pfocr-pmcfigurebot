  signaling
caption: '(A) Expression levels of GZMB, IFN-γ, Ki-67, and TNFα in WT and Smad4-deficient
  CD8+ T cells. Cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28
  (5 μg/ml) and cultured in the presence of IL-2 (1 ng/ml) in vitro for 3 to 4 days.
  Measured by flow cytometry. FSC, forward scatter. (B) WT or Smad4-deficient OT-I
  cells were activated in vitro for 3 days and mixed with E.G7 cells at 1:1 ratio.
  Intracellular cleaved caspase-3 was measured by anti–cleaved caspase 3 (1:100) at
  5 hours after coculture. GZMB was measured by anti-GZMB (1:400) at 24 hours after
  coculture. (C) Top: Expression levels of GZMB, IFN-γ, and Ki-67 in WT and Smad4-deficient
  CD8+ T cells in the presence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). Bottom: Expression of GZMB, IFN-γ,
  and TNFα in WT and Smad4-deficient CD8+ T cells in the presence of anti–TGF-β (1
  μg/ml). Measured by flow cytometry after 3 days of culture. (D) Expression levels
  of effector molecules in WT and Smad4-deficient CD8+ T cells in the presence of
  TGF-β receptor inhibitor (SB431542; 1 μM) or BMP receptor inhibitor (K02288; 10
  μM). Measured by flow cytometry after 3 to 4 days of culture. These experiments
  were repeated three times. Data are represented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05 and ***P
  < 0.001. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.'
