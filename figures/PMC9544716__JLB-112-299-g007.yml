caption: AMPK activity was inhibited by increased ATP synthesis in AML cells co‐cultured
  with HS‐5 cells. (A) Representative western blot analysis of proteins involved in
  the AMPK‐mTORC1 pathway (total AMPK, p‐AMPKT172, total p70S6K, p‐p70S6KT389, total
  4E‐BP1, p‐4E‐BP1S65, and c‐Myc; β‐actin was used as loading control) from AML cells
  cultured alone or with HS‐5 cells. The expression levels of p‐p70S6KT389 and p‐4E‐BP1S65
  were used as indicators of mTORC1 activity. (B) Representative western blot analysis
  of AMPK‐mTORC1 pathway proteins of AML cells after treatment with 10 μM Oligomycin
  A. The representative images of 3 independent experiments were used
