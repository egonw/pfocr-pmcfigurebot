caption: The effects of stellettin B on autophagy-related AVOs and autophagy proteins
  p62, LC3-I/II, and Beclin-1. (A) The fluorescence intensity of AO measured for detecting
  autophagy at 0–20 µM stellettin B for 24 and 48 h using a Beckman CytoFLEX flow
  cytometer. (B) Quantified levels of AVO-positive cells after exposure to 0–20 µM
  stellettin B for 24 and 48 h were analyzed using Beckman CytoExpert flow analysis
  software (v.2.5., Indianapolis, IN, USA). (C) OC2 and SCC4 cells were exposed to
  0-20 µM stellettin B for 24 and 48 h. Western blot analysis was performed with the
  use of antibodies against autophagy-related proteins LC3, p62, Beclin-1, and β-actin.
  (D) Quantified levels of the proteins in C. Original, uncropped images of the Western
  blots are displayed in . β-actin was used as an internal control, and error bars
  stand for the mean ± SE. The data are shown for a minimum of three independent trials
  in triplicate analyzed using Student’s t-test to determine significance; * p < 0.05
  and ** p < 0.01 relative to the control (untreated cells).
