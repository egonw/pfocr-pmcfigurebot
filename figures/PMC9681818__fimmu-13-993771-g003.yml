caption: IL-1β signaling pathways are enriched in tumor infiltrating myeloid cells
  in human HNSCC. (A) Heatmap showing differential gene expression profile between
  CD11b+ myeloid cells flow sorted from matched blood or tumor from 7 HNSCC patients
  as measured by bulk RNA-seq. (B) Differential inflammasome signature in tumor and
  blood myeloid cells (n=7). (C) Ingenuity pathway (IPA) and gene ontology (GO) analyses
  showing enrichment of IL-1 signaling in tumor infiltrating myeloid cells over those
  from blood. (D) Caspase 1 activity is upregulated in tumor infiltrating CD11b+ myeloid
  cells compared to circulating blood CD11b+ cells (n=3). Statistics represent paired
  t-test and error bars represent SD (D). (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; ns, not significant).
