caption: 'XFBD reduced inflammation responses due to attenuated activation STAT3 and
  blocked C5a–C5aR axis in IgG-IC-induced macrophages. MH-S cells were pretreated
  with CAF (STAT3 activator) or C5a prior to IgG-IC stimulation, and then incubated
  with 10% CONs or XFBDs for 24 h. (A) Western blot analysis of C5aR, p-STAT3, IL-18
  and IL-1β. (B) Western blot analysis of C5aR, p-STAT3, p- NF-κB p65, IL-18 and IL-1β.
  Data are shown as the mean±SD of at least three independent experiments. *p<0.05
  vs. the CONs group; &p<0.05 vs. the CAF+ CONs group (A) or the C5a+ CONs group (B);
  #p<0.05 vs. the XFBDs group.'
