caption: 'Docked positions of substrates at the active site: Orientation of cyanidin
  at the active site of SbFNR2 for the first hydride transfer from NADPH to (A) C2
  atom of cyanidin, (B) C4 atom of cyanidin. (C–F) the resulting stereoisomers of
  the first hydride transfer reaction, which are associated with the active site for
  the secondary hydride transfer. (A–F) in the right-side panel the compounds in the
  right-side panel are drawn with ChemDraw v.22.2.0. (A,B) cyanidin. IUPAC nomenclature
  of the corresponding intermediates and products are (C) (R)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2H-chromene-3,5,7-triol;
  (D) (S)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2H-chromene-3,5,7-triol; (E) (S)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-3,4-dihydrochromenylium;
  (F) (R)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-3,4-dihydrochromenylium. The figure
