caption: The metabolite profile of TBAD patients. (A) OPLS-DA for discriminating hypertensive
  patients with or without TBAD. Blue represented the control group; pink represented
  TBAD group. (B) Volcano plots showed the differential metabolites between the two
  groups. Gray dots represented the insignificantly changed metabolites; red represented
  the upregulated; green represented the downregulated. (C) Heatmap illustrated the
  relative abundance of the differential metabolites in each sample. Red represented
  high level and green represented low level, respectively. (D) The counts of differential
  metabolites in each class. (E) SMPDB pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated the
  metabolic pathway enriched by the differential metabolites. The bubble size represented
  the number of differential metabolites in each pathway while the color indicated
  the P value. n=16 (TBAD group); n=7 (control group). TBAD, type B aortic dissection;
  VIP, variable importance in projection; FC, fold change; OPLS-DA, orthogonal partial
  least squares-discriminant analysis; SMPDB, small molecule pathway database.
