caption: 'Schematic model on the role of Linc00662 in regulating PC malignant progression
  through the GTF2B-ITGA1-FAK pathway. This study proposes a novel regulatory mechanism
  of Linc00662 in oncogene activation in PC. Linc00662 activates the transcription
  of ITGA1 by recruiting GTF2B in a m6A-dependent manner and promotes PC cell proliferation,
  invasion, and migration, which partly relies on the activation of focal adhesions
  through the ITGA1-FAK-Erk pathway. And Y15 treatment inhibits autophosphorylation
  of FAK and obviously represses tumor progression of Linc00662-overexpressing PC
  cells. Abbreviations: PC: pancreatic cancer, GTF2B: general transcription factor
  II-B, ITGA1: integrin alpha-1, m6A: N6-methyladenosine.'
