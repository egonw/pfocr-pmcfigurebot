caption: miR-146a-5p is highly expressed in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. (a–c) After
  treating AR42J cells with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 nM cerulein, ELISA detected the levels
  of inflammatory factors in the culture medium, with 10 μg/mL LPS and 10 mM ATP as
  positive controls. (d, e) The expression of inflammation-related miRNAs in AR42J
  cells with 10 nM cerulein was detected by RT-qPCR, with 10 μg/mL LPS and 10 mM ATP
  as positive controls. (f) RT-qPCR was used for disclosing the expression of miR-146a-5p
  in cerulein-induced AR42J cells with miR-146a-5p mimics or mimics nc. (g–i) ELISA
  detected the expression of inflammatory factors in the culture medium of cerulein-induced
  AR42J cells. (j) CCK8 detected the proliferation of cerulein-induced AR42J cells.
  (k) Flow cytometry (FCM) assay detected the apoptosis of cerulein-induced AR42J
  cells. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001. The experiments were repeated three
  times, the statistical test was a two-tailed test, and errors bars in the figures
  represent standard deviation (SD).
