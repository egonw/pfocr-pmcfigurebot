caption: 'Effects of PSPs on M1 and M2 phenotypic polarization and TLR4-MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway of mouse macrophages. (a) The effect of PSPs on M1 and M2 phenotypic
  polarization of mouse macrophages was measured by flow cytometry. (b) The expression
  of TLR4-MAPK/NF-κB signal proteins in lung tissue. Compared with the control group,
  ∗∗P < 0.01; compared with LPS group, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001.'
