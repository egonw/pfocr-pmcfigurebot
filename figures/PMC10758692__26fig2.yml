caption: CCOC and ENOC resemble different phases of normal cyclic endometrium based
  on gene expression profile. A, RNA-seq UMAP shows tumors clustering by histotype
  and with putative corresponding normal cell(s) of origin. Each dot represents a
  sample, with colors indicating sample type. B, Globally, CCOC–ENOC expression differences
  for all genes (log2-fold change, x-axis) are positively correlated with fold change
  between secretory and proliferative endometrium (y-axis). Top 20 DEGs by P value
  for secE versus proE are labeled. C, Significant DEGs between CCOC and ENOC also
  separate endometrium of different phases (FDR <0.05 and absolute fold change >2).
  Each row represents a DEG and each column a sample. Both rows and columns are clustered
  by Euclidian distance after first grouping by fold change sign (rows) as well as
  into CCOC, ENOC, and endometrium (columns). Note that secE and proE separate perfectly
  based on CCOC versus ENOC DEGs. Gene expression (Log2 RPKM) is row normalized into
  Z-scores, capped at ±2. The 25 most up- and downregulated genes by P value are labeled.
  D, Gene-concept network plot showing enriched molecular pathways for genes upregulated
  in both CCOC relative to ENOC and secE relative to proE. Numbered nodes represent
  pathways, with DEGs in that pathway connected to the corresponding node. The size
  of each node is scaled on the basis of the number of overlapped DEGs in that pathway.
  E, As in D, but for pathways enriched in genes overexpressed in ENOC relative to
  CCOC and proE relative to secE. F, CCOC and ENOC share key metabolic pathways with
  secE and proE, respectively. Color of the heatmap represents Z-score as in C for
  genes (rows) from four pathways significantly overrepresented in DEGs between secretory
  and proliferative endometrium.
