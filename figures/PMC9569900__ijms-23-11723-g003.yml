caption: KITLG promoted EndoMT and furthered the increase in permeability of GECs
  through the AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. EndoMT markers, including E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, and vimentin levels, were assessed in HGECs treated with BSA (300 μg/ml)
  or AGE–BSA (300 μg/ml) for 48 h (n = 3). (A–C) After treatment with KITLG (10 ng/ml)
  for 48 h, EndoMT was examined in HGECs using Western blotting (n = 3). (D) The permeability
  of HGECs was examined after treatment with normal control (NC) and KITLG (10 ng/ml)
  for 48 h using FITC–dextran dye (n = 3). (E,F) PCDH7 and PCDH17 mRNA were assessed
  in HGECs treated with NC and KITLG for 24 h (n = 3). (G–J) The level of phospho-AKT/AKT
  and phospho-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 protein expression in HGECs treated with BSA, AGE–BSA,
  NC or KITLG for 6 h were examined using Western blotting. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 by Student’s t-test.
