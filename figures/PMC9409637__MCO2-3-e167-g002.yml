caption: Mechanisms of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines for infectious diseases
  and cancers. mRNA molecules encoding tumor antigens are injected into body (either
  with or without delivery vehicles). The mRNA molecules are taken up and translated
  into protein antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs). After proteasomal processing
  of proteins, antigen peptides associate with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  Class I molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transferred to the APC surface,
  activating CD8+ T cells for a specific cellular immune response. Protein antigens,
  which are sorted for the endosome route, can activate CD4+ T cells via the MHC Class
  II presentation pathway. The secretory protein antigen or membrane antigen encoded
  by mRNA can stimulate B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies, and activate phagocytes
  such as macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines, facilitating the clearance
  of circulating infectious pathogens and tumor cells
