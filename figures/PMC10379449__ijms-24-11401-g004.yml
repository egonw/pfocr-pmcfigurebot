caption: 'TGF-β1 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways regulate Fgf21-induced MyHC expression
  in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 cells were treated with inhibitors for 24 h and then infected
  with LV-Fgf21 for 12 h, continued induction of myotube differentiation. (A) C2C12
  cells were harvested to detect MyHC I, MyHC IIa, MyHC IIb, TGF-β1, Smad2/3, mmp9,
  and p-p38 via immunoblot. (B) Data are shown in the bar graph as the fold change
  of normalized proteins of β-actin (mean ± SE). (C) The mRNA expression of MyHC I,
  MyHC IIa, MyHC IIb, MyoD, and MyoG were detected via real-time qPCR. Results are
  reported in the bar graph as the fold changes of mRNAs normalized to β-actin (mean
  ± SE). (D) Cellular immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the impact of
  pathway inhibitors on the eMyHC-positive myotubes induced by Fgf21 (Scale bar in
  200 μm). Bars mean p ≤ 0.05 analyses followed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s
  tests. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. DMSO; ##p < 0.01 vs. SB431542; &p < 0.05, &&p
  < 0.01 vs. SB203580.'
