caption: Manhattan plots illustrating the associations (-log10(P) values; Y-axis)
  between 130 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; X-axis by chromosome positions)
  within 14 genes involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and (A) cancer-specific
  survival, (B) overall survival, and (C) progression-free survival in patients with
  prostate cancer undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy. Genes with significant
  associations (P < 0.05) are labeled. Red horizontal line indicates the significance
  threshold (q = 0.05), while green horizontal line represents the nominal significance
  threshold (P = 0.05).
