caption: Blocking the Th2 signaling pathway alleviates the clinical symptoms and inflammation
  in experiment AC (EAC) model. (A) Experimental protocol. OVA was used to establish
  the EAC model and CM310 was applied to block the Th2 signaling pathway. (B) Body
  weight changes with different treatments. (C) Demonstrative images of ocular allergic
  symptoms in the specified investigational group. (D) Statistical analysis of clinical
  score of AC symptoms. (E) Serum IgE (left) and OVA-specific IgE (right) levels were
  measured by ELISA. (F). H&E staining of conjunctival samples from mice in the specified
  investigational group that showed more eosinophil infiltration in the conjunctiva
  of the model group that compared with the control group and the treated groups.
  (G) Statistical analysis of H&E score for conjunctiva eosinophil infiltration. (H)
  Toluidine blue staining showed mastocytes (MCs) degranulation in the rat conjunctiva
  that normal MCs were identified based on their regular shape in control group and
  activated MCs were identified based on their irregular shape in model group. (I)
  Statistical analysis of t mastocyte degranulation rate. Statistical data are expressed
  as the mean value Â± SEM (n = 10), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
