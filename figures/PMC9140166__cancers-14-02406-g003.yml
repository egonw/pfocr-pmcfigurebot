caption: 'Ligustilide inhibits the pro-angiogenic effect of CAFs via the TLR4-AP-1
  signaling pathway. MTT detection of CAF supernatants treated with different concentrations
  of ligustilide (0, 20 or 40 μM) or CLI-095 (TLR4 inhibitor, 10 nM) pretreatment
  then treated with ligustilide (40 μM) in the supernatants of CAFs to induce HUVEC
  proliferation (A). The supernatant of CAFs, the supernatant of CAFs treated with
  ligustilide or the supernatant of CAFs treated with ligustilide after pretreatment
  with CLI-095 was photographed under a microscope (×40) to record the migration (B,C)
  and tube formation (D,E) of HUVECs. PCR detection of AP-1 mRNA levels in CAFs treated
  with ligustilide or ligustilide after pretreatment with CLI-095 (F). Western blot
  detection of MYD88, p-TAK1, p-p38, p-JNK, p-ERK and AP1 protein levels in CAFs treated
  with ligustilide or ligustilide after pretreatment with CLI-095 (G,H). GAPDH was
  used as a loading control. SB203580 (p38 inhibitor, 30 μM), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor,
  20 μM) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor, 5 μM) inhibited the effect of ligustilide on
  HUVEC proliferation (I), migration (J,K) and tube formation (L,M). PBS was used
  as the control. Each dataset represents the mean ± SD of at least three independent
  experiments. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001, ns: not significant. The original blots
  could be found in .'
