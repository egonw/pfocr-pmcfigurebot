caption: 'Luminal breast cancer and BLBC cells regulated by FOXF2 exhibit partial
  mesenchymal stem cell properties toward osteogenic differentiation and myogenic
  differentiation, respectively.A and B, the osteogenic differentiation (A) and adipogenic
  differentiation (B) capabilities of the indicated cells were assessed by induction
  with osteogenic differentiation media for 21 days and adipogenic differentiation
  media for 25 days and then staining with Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O, respectively.
  The number of calcium nodules was counted and the percentage of Oil Red O+ cells
  was calculated. Arrow points to lipid droplet. C, CDH11+ and α-SMA+ cell populations
  were detected by FCM analysis. ND: not detected. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with control
  cells. BLBC, basal-like breast cancers; FCM, flow cytometric.'
