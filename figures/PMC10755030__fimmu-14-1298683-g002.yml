caption: Role of NK cells in radiotherapy-induced antitumor immunity. 1.Following
  radiotherapy, the dsDNA of tumor cells is exposed to the cytoplasm to activate the
  cGAS/STING pathway, initiate type I interferon response, induce the secretion of
  some chemotactic factors, and recruit NK cells into the tumor microenvironment.
  2. Radiotherapy can upregulate the expression of several adhesion molecules like
  ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which increases the adhesion of NK cells to the endothelial surface.
  3. After radiotherapy, tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in stress proteins MICA/B
  and ULBP1-6, which can effectively activate NK cells and initiate an immune response
  against the tumor. 4. Radiotherapy induces ICD in tumor cells, leads to the release
  of DAMPs, and activates NK cells. 5. Radiotherapy plays a pivotal role in decreasing
  tumor burden and creating a favorable environment for NK cell infiltration. The
  figure is created with BioRender.com NK, natural killer; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase;
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1;
  VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; MIC, major histocompatibility complex
  class I chain-related protein. ULBP, UL16-binding protein; ICD, immunogenic cell
  death; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns.
