caption: 'Experimental study on the improvement of hypoxic injury of HT22 cells by
  GAS based on the regulation of ferroptosis by the GPx4 pathway. (A,B), GPx4 and
  COX2 were analyzed using Western blot. Pharmacological inhibitors; erastin (ferroptosis
  inducers), ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis inhibitor) (C), intracellular ROS levels were
  labeled with 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, 10 μM) and detected
  by flow cytometry (n = 3) (D), levels of GSH in HT22 cells treated with ferroptosis
  inducers (erastin) were detected with or without GAS treatment (100 μM) for 24 h
  (n = 3) (E), detection of intracellular Fe2+ changes using FerroOrange. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 compared to the
  hypoxia group; &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, compared to the hypoxia + ferrostatin-1 or
  hypoxia + erastin group.'
