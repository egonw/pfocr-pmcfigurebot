caption: 'UPL5 was able to ubiquitinate WHY2 protein(A) WHY2 was degraded by UPL5
  via 26S ubiquitination proteome pathway in the cell-free system; CHX, inhibitor
  of protein synthesis, MG132, inhibitor of protein degradation.(B) WHY2 was ubiquitinated
  by UPL5 in vitro ubiquitination assay. E1, ubiquitin activate enzyme; E2, ubiquitin
  conjugation enzyme.(C) WHY2 protein level was immunodetected after UPL5 induction
  by 2 mM estradiol with a time course of 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 h in oeWHY2-HA/ID:UPL5-His
  double mutants.(D) oeWHY2-HAc/ID:UPL5(m)-His double mutants. ID: inducible promoter
  by estradiol. Coomassie staining was used as loading controls.'
article_title: UPL5 modulates WHY2 protein distribution in a Kub-site dependent ubiquitination
  in response to [Ca2+]cyt-induced leaf senescence.
