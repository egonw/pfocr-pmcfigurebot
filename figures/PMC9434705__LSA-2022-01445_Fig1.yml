figure_title: BRAFV600E inhibits MST2 signalling
caption: (A) A375, SK-Mel28, WM-793, and SK-Mel2 cell were treated with 1 μM PLX4032
  for the indicated times. Cell extracts were analysed by immunoblotting with the
  indicated antibodies. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with pCDNA-FLAG (EV) or the
  different FLAG-BRAF constructs indicated. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and FLAG-BRAF
  protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using FLAG beads. BRAF-MST2 interaction
  and MST2 activation were determined by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.
  (C) A375, SK-Mel28, WM-793, and SK-Mel2 were treated with PLX4032 for the indicated
  times before MST2 and BRAFV600E were immunoprecipitated. Endogenous MST2 and BRAF
  interaction was monitored by blotting with the indicated antibodies. (D) Mutant
  BRAF cells A375, SK-Mel28, and WM-793 were transfected with non-targeting (control)
  or MST2 siRNA (50 nM). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with PLX4032
  (3 μM) for 24 h and cell death was determined by assaying DNA fragmentation by FACS.
  Percent apoptosis in cells transfected with MST2 siRNA relative to control transfected
  cells is indicated. An aliquot of the cells was lysed and immunoblotted with the
  indicated antibodies to determine protein expression. The expression of MST2 normalized
  to the GAPDH loading control was determined by Image J scanning. Error bars show
  SD n = 3 for A375 and SK-Mel28; n = 2 WM-793. In all blots numbers indicate molecular
  weight (kD).Source data are available for this figure.
