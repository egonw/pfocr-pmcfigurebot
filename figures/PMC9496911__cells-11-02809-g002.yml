caption: The oxidative damage scavenging effect of melatonin in neuron cells. (A)
  The survival rates of PC12 cells that received different concentrations of melatonin
  treatment were detected using a CCK-8 kit (n = 8). (B) The ROS produced in PC12
  cells that received different treatments were detected by ROS staining (n = 6, scale
  bar = 100 µm). (C,D) The mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12 cells treated
  with drugs was detected by JC-1 staining (n = 8, scale bar = 100 µm). (E–G) The
  contents of SOD and MDA and the activity of GSH-PX were detected using the corresponding
  kits in PC12 cells treated with different treatment factors (n = 10). Data are shown
  as the means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
