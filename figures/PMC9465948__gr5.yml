caption: Blood–brain barrier permeability hypothesis. We propose a mechanistic pathway
  by which peripheral inflammation, exacerbated by plasmin activation, leads to breakdown
  of the blood–brain barrier. Subsequent inflammatory changes lead to a central anti-inflammatory
  response, including lactate-induced activation of HCA receptors. The downstream
  effects on PGD2 lead to delirium though synaptic suppression. This results in reduced
  cerebral activity evident in EEG slowing. HCA, hydroxycarbolic acid; PGD2, prostaglandin
  D2.
