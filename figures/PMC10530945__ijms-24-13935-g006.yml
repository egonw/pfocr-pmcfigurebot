caption: 'Injected CoNCDs for S180 tumor therapy: (a) schematic illustration of the
  experimental; (b) picture of tumors in different treatments; (c) tumor weight of
  different treatments; (d) tumor growth curves of different treatments; (e) average
  body weights; (f) tumor tissues of different groups on the 11th day were observed
  under a standard optical microscope (10 × 10) after H&E staining. 1: PBS; 2: CoNCDs
  were intratumorally injected (CoNCDs = 0.3 mg); 3: CoNCDs were intravenously injected
  (CoNCDs = 0.3 mg); and 4: CoNCDs were intravenously injected (CoNCDs = 0.5 mg).
  * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001, ns means no significant difference.'
