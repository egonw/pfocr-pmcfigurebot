figure_title: MAPK activation and targeting in bladder cancer
caption: (A) The RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade links extracellular signals to cell
  differentiation, proliferation, and growth. (B) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicates
  that MAPK alterations make up 36.4 % of high-grade MIBCs. (C) Specific inhibitors
  may differentially target putative genomic alterations that activate the MAPK pathway
  to treat bladder tumors. Asterisks indicate mutations.
