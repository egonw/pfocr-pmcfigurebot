caption: 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus JYLR-005 decreases intestinal permeability and inhibits
  LPS/TLRs/NF-κB pathway activation induced by HRZE. (a) Serum concentration of FD4
  (n = 5 per group); (b) serum concentration of LPS (n = 6 per group); (c) TNF-α,
  (d) IL-1β, (e) IL-6, (f) TLR2, (g) TLR4, and (h) NF-κB mRNA levels of liver tissue
  in each group (n = 6 per group). The data are presented as the means ± SEM (n =
  6 per group). The HRZE + JYLR-005 group and the HRZE + MgIG group shared the control
  group and the HRZE group. Compared with the control group: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001. Compared with the HRZE group: #p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01, and ####p < 0.0001.'
