caption: 'The effect of the COS treatment on the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway in H2O2-stimulated
  KGN cells. (a) Production of ROS determined by a fluorescent probe. (b) MitoTracker
  was stained on KGN cells by immunofluorescence. (c) JC-1 red, JC-1 green, and merge
  image. (d, e) The statistics histogram of immunofluorescence expressed fluorescent
  intensity. (f) Statistics data were expressed in terms of the ratio of JC-1 red
  to JC-1 green. Data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  or ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, or ###P < 0.001 vs.
  the H2O2 group; &P < 0.05, &&P < 0.01, or &&&P < 0.001 vs. the H2O2+100 COS+KC7F2
  group. Scale bar: (a) ROS/MitoTracker: 100 μm; JC-1 red/JC-1 green/merge: 50 μm.'
