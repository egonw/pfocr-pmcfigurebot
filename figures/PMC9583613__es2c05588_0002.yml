caption: 'Schematic illustration of the factors that can affect metabolic pathway
  analysis of metabolomics data, at different stages of the study. Inputs: affected
  by the organism and pathway database chosen; affected by the significance threshold
  used to choose the number of metabolite hits. Pathway analysis: the use of a background
  set (reference metabolome) is particularly important. Outputs: have the P values
  for the pathways been corrected for multiple testing (based on the total number
  of pathways in the database)?'
