caption: Overexpression of DAZAP1 enhances the proliferative capacity of MM cells
  in vitro. (A and B) DAZAP1 expression in DAZAP1-OE and siDAZAP1 MM cells were examined
  by WB analysis. (C and D) The proliferation rate of DAZAP1-OE and siDAZAP1 MM cells
  was assessed by CCK8 assay. (E) Soft agar colony formation assay revealed overexpressed
  DAZAP1 accelerating colony formation. (F) The histogram showed quantification of
  colony formation in soft agar. All data management and analysis were done using
  the GraphPad Prism 8.0 version. The P value was calculated with Studentâ€™s t-test,
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
