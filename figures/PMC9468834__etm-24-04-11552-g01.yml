caption: Expression of miR-146a-5p is elevated in IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Caco-2
  cells were incubated with (A) 10 ng/ml IL-1β or (B) IL-1β for 3 h at the indicated
  concentrations and relative expression of miR-146a-5p was determined by reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR. *Ρ<0.05, **Ρ<0.01, ***Ρ<0.001, ****Ρ<0.0001 vs.
  0 h or 0 ng/ml. miR, microRNA.
article_title: miR‑146a‑5p negatively regulates the IL‑1β‑stimulated inflammatory
  response via downregulation of the IRAK1/TRAF6 signaling pathway in human intestinal
  epithelial cells.
