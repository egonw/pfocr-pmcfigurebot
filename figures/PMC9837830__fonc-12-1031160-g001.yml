caption: RNF128 is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues. (A, B) The mRNA expression
  of RNF128 was evaluated in CRC datasets from the GEPIA and TCGA databases. (C) HE
  and IHC analysis of RNF128 expression in normal tissues and CRC tissues. (D) The
  protein levels of RNF128 in CRC tissues and normal tissues (n=6) were analyzed by
  western blot assays. *P<0.05, **P<0.001.
article_title: Ring finger protein 128 promotes, rather than inhibits, colorectal
  cancer progression by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.
