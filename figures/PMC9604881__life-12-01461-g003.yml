caption: Knockdown of MED16 hinders proliferation of BC cells. (A,B) RT−qPCR and western
  blot revealed the expression of MED16 was overexpressed and inhibited remarkably
  in MCF7 and T47D. (C) Growth curve of MCF7 and T47D cells infection of MED16−negative
  control and MED16−knockdown was displayed. Relative proliferation ratio against
  day 0 were observed for 5 days (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p <
  0.0001). (D) Colony formation of MED16−overexpression cells and MED16-knockdown
  cells compared with MED16-negative control cells. (E) Representative fluorescence
  images of Edu staining of MCF7 and T47D cells. Proliferating MCF7 and T47D positively
  stained with Edu showed red colour. Cell nuclei stained with DAPI showed blue colour.
  The length of bar represents 750 μm, chart of proliferating cells (red) to total
  cells (blue). (F) Knockdown of MED16 induced G1−phase cell cycle arrested. Flow
  cytometric assay was employed to analyse the cell cycle distribution. Percentage
  of cells in the G1 phase was evidently increased, compared with the control group.
  (G) c-MYC, cyclinD1 protein expression in MCF7 and T47D cells with control (Vector)
  and MED16-overexpressed cells, control (shNC) and MED16−knockdown cells (sh1, sh2).
