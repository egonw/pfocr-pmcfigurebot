caption: IMP3 regulates re‐endothelialization after vascular injury. The vascular
  endothelium is denudated after the right carotid artery wire injury surgery. IMP3
  could directly bind to VEGF mRNA whilst increasing VEGF mRNA stability, which in
  turn regulates endothelial cell functions through the activation of VEGF/PI3K/Akt
  signalling pathway. Overexpression of IMP3 promotes ECs proliferation within the
  lesion area, enhances ECs migration from adjacent lesion site and inhibits EC apoptosis.
  Collectively, IMP3 could contribute to accelerated re‐endothelialization as well
  as reduced intimal hyperplasia
