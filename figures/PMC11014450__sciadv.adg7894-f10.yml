figure_title: Pathway for regulation of PGC number in embryos
caption: SMG protein is synthesized and transported into the germ plasm of the early
  embryo. There, SMG represses translation of the osk and bru1 mRNAs (solid lines),
  attenuating synthesis of OSK protein and recruitment of the VAS protein (double-headed
  gray arrow), thus preventing additional germ plasm assembly in the embryo (gray
  arrow). Our data suggest that SMG may also repress translation of the gcl mRNA (dashed
  lines), which encodes a protein required for budding of the PGCs. By down-regulating
  germ plasm assembly and GCL, SMG modulates PGC numbers in the embryo (gray arrows).
