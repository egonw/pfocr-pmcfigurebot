caption: AKT/Bcl2 signalling pathway is a key mechanism by which α-hederin overcomes
  hypoxia-mediated resistance in CRC cells. (A) Treatment of hypoxic CRC cells with
  α-hederin affected the expression of related proteins, as determined by western
  blot analysis, β-actin blot is the loading control blot for all of the proteins.
  (B) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression levels
  of HIF-1α, Bcl2 and Bcl-xL after α-hederin treatment of hypoxic CRC cells. After
  OE of AKT, the effect of α-hederin treatment on the (C) protein and (D) mRNA expression
  levels of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL in hypoxic CRC cells was observed. (E and F) After OE
  of AKT, the apoptosis of hypoxic CRC cells treated with α-hederin was evaluated.
  After OE of AKT, the levels of (G) cytochrome c and (H) Caspase 3 were observed
  after α-hederin treatment of hypoxic CRC cells. Data are presented as the mean ±
  SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. vehicle or as indicated. CRC, colorectal cancer; OE, overexpression;
  p-, phosphorylated; PI, propidium iodide.
