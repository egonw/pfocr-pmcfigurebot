figure_title: Interference with the Notch signalling pathway leads to increased proliferation
caption: 'A, B Representative micrographs of the V‐SVZ of mice injected with an AAV
  overexpressing GFP and a shRNA against Hes1 (AAV Hes1‐sh) or a scrambled sequence
  (AAV sc‐sh). Coronal sections were stained with either Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD, A) or Ki67 to visualize cycling cells (B). DAPI was used for nuclear counterstain,
  scale bars indicate 20 μm. Arrows indicate apical GFP+ (white) and basal GFP− (yellow)
  cells displaying NICD staining.C–E Quantification of fold change in NICD levels;
  N = 3 (C), Ki67+ cells; N = 5 (D) and GFP+DCX− cells in the olfactory bulb (OB)
  14 days (14D) and 6 weeks (6 W) after virus injection (E).F–H Quantitative analysis
  illustrating NICD levels in apical and basal cells in virgin (Virg) and littermate
  dams that have been lactating for 7 days (Lact); N = 11 (F), the total percentage
  of apical G+ and G− cells (G) and the percentage of activated cells in each population
  after 17 days of lactation. N = 5 (H). Data information: N refers number of to biological
  replicates; for each biological replicate (except G + H), at least three technical
  replicates were performed. Bars represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  determined by two‐way ANOVA with Sidak''s multiple comparisons test (C–F) or two‐tailed
  unpaired Student''s t‐test (G + H).'
