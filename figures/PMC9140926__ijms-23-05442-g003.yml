caption: 'Effect of PUG on nitric oxide (NO) release on RAW264.7 macrophage cells.
  RAW264.7 cells were pretreated without and with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C.
  Then the cells were treated with PUG (4, and 6 μM) for 24 h at 37 °C. After treatment,
  the medium was collected and used for the assay. A NO detection kit was used to
  determine the NO concentration in the samples. The samples were measured at 520
  nm. The absorbance values of the standards and samples were used to plot the graph.
  The statistical significance was ## p < 0.01 vs. untreated group; and * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS-alone treated group.'
