caption: Stress granule formation is mediated by tiRNAs. 5’-tiRNAs promote the formation
  of stress granules (SGs), phase-separated cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins assemblies
  lacking in membranes that condense mRNAs, ribosomal components, RNA binding proteins,
  and translation initiation factors [], in response to stress conditions such as
  hypoxia and heat shock. Through the activation of NF-κB and PKR, SGs play a role
  in immunity. SGs reduce the production of NFKBIA mRNA, which would normally block
  the NF-κB pathway during the inflammatory process. As a result, SGs boost the NF-κB
  pathway. Virus infection also increases the association of G3BP1, Caprin1, and PKR,
  resulting in the G3BP1-Caprin1-PKR complex. SGs play a role in PKR activation through
  the G3BP1-Caprin1-PKR complex.
