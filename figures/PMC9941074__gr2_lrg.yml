caption: Activation of the inflammatory response and associated molecular signaling
  pathways leads to a disordered internal host environment in patients with COVID-19.
  SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells, and its byproducts are detected by TLR3/7/8, RIG-I/MDA5
  and NLRP3. The downstream transcription factors IRF3/7 are then activated to induce
  IFN-I production and trigger the canonical NF-κB pathway by promoting IKKα/IKKβ/NEMO-mediated
  phosphorylation of IκBs, which leads to the translocation of the RelA/p50 complex
  into the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of various genes associated with
  inflammation. ROS and excessive cytokine release also trigger the canonical NF-κB
  pathway and the noncanonical NF-κB pathway by activating NIK. ROS stimulate the
  NLRP3 inﬂammasome and facilitate the maturation of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β. IFN-I
  also activates the JAK/STAT pathway and promotes ISGs expression. Ang II is transformed
  to Ang 1-7 by ACE2, and Ang II promotes ROS production, which is facilitated by
  AT1R and NADPH oxidase.
