caption: 'Schematic representation of the signalling transduction pathways involving
  the tuberous sclerosis proteins, hamartin and tuberin. The main pathway involved
  in lymphangioleiomyomatosis pathogenesis is mediated by Akt, whose activation inhibits
  hamartin–tuberin complex, leading to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation
  and thus to cell growth and proliferation. Arrows indicate activating or facilitating
  influences; flat-headed lines indicate inhibitory influences. ERK2: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 2; MK2: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated
  protein kinase 2; Rheb: Ras homologue expressed in brain; ERα: oestrogen receptor
  α; PDGFRβ: platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; CaM: calmodulin; ERM: ezrin-radixin-moesin.'
