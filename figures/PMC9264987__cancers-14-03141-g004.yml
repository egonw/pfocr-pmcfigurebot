caption: CCL11 and CCR3 expression with associated signal pathway in HNC cell lines
  and their correlation to clinical outcomes in 104 HNC patients. (a) Confocal microscopic
  images showed CCL11 (green) localized to both cell and nuclear membranes, while
  CCR3 (red) localized only to the cell membrane in FaDu cells; CCL11 and CCR3 co-localized
  at the cell membrane (yellow). In NPC204 cells, CCL11 (green) and CCR3 (red) were
  found to co-localize at protrusions polarized to the cells (yellow). (b) Using the
  crisp technique, higher expression of CCR3, MMP2, and MMP3 was found in over-expressed
  CCL11 cloned-FaDu and NPC204 cells. Cloned CCL11-overexpressed cells were abolished
  by adding eotaxin siRNA or CCR3 antibody, which reversed the expression of CCR3
  and invasion-related MMP2 and MMP9. (c) Higher phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK
  and ERK were found in cloned CCL11-overexpressed FaDu and NPC204 cells and were
  reversed by treatment of the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and ERK inhibitor (FR180204),
  respectively. The phosphorylation level of JNK was kept in low condition before
  and after treatment of the JNK inhibitor (SP600125). (d) Photomicrographs of immunohistochemical
  staining from tissue microarray showing CCL11 and CCR3 expression in three different
  representative groups of HNC patients (magnification, ×200). (e) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis of patients showed that overexpression of CCL11 and CCR3 were statistically
  associated with poor overall survival).
