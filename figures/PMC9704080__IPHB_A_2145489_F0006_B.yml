caption: Expression of caspases associated with the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic
  pathway in 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide-treated HA22T and HepG2 cells. (A) Western
  blotting showed the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HA22T and HepG2
  cells treated with different concentrations of 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide (1, 2,
  and 4 µM) for 24 h. (B) Caspase 3 and caspase 9 inhibitors affected the viability
  of HA22T and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Cells were inoculated into the
  24-well plates with or without pre-treatment with Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase 3 inhibitor)
  and Z-VAD-FMK (a cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor). The cells were then treated
  with 4 µM 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide. An MTT assay was performed to assess cell viability.
  Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, and at least three independent
  experiments were performed (# p < 0.05, compared with 13-acetoxysarcocrassolide
  treatment groups).
