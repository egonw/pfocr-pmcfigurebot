caption: 'Modulatory effects of the plant-derived substances on different steps of
  adipogenesis. The wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signalling, the growth
  factor-beta (TGF-β)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling, Hedgehogs (Hh), Notch,
  and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-dependent response are the main mechanisms
  regulating the commitment of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Early stages
  of adipocyte differentiation are primarily regulated by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, responsible
  for the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ—the central positive modulators of adipogenesis.
  The rhubarb-originated substances may interfere with different pathways controlling
  the adipocyte differentiation and maturation, including the blockade of clonal expansion
  as well as downregulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Abbreviations and explanations: AMPK—AMP-activated
  protein kinase; KLF 2—Krüppel-like factor; Pref-1—preadipocyte factor 1; DEC1,2—transcription
  factors DEC1,2; GATA 2/3—GATA-binding factor 2/3; SIRT1/2—sirtuin 1,2; TGF-β—tumour
  growth factor beta; PI3K/Akt—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/Protein Kinase
  B pathway; KLF4/5/9/15—Krüppel-like factors 4,5,9, and 15; CREB—cAMP response element-binding
  protein; SIRT7—sirtuin 7; SREBP1—sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; ZFP423—C2H2
  zinc-finger protein; FXR—farnesoid X receptor; C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ—CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein alpha, beta and delta; PPARγ—peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma.'
