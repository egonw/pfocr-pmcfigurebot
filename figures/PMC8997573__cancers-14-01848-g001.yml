caption: 'HuR regulates homologous recombination repair in PDAC cells. (A) Comet assay
  showing an increase in DNA damage when MiaPaCa-2 cells were transfected with siHuR
  (siHuR#1) as compared with the siSCR control. H2O2 was used as a positive control
  (the scale bar: 10–50 μM). Mean ± SEM, n = 3. **** p < 0.0001 (Student’s t-test).
  Validation of HuR knockdown is shown on the right. (B) pDR-GFP assay: MiaPaCa-2-DRGFP
  cells were transfected with siHuR (siHuR#1) and 24 h later they were re-transfected
  with pCBASceI (10 µg). Graph shows the percentage of HRR efficiency by comparing
  siHuR and siSCR, as calculated by quantitating GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry.
  Mean ± SEM, n = 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test). Validation of HuR
  knockdown is shown on the right. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis of siHuR (HuR_NT)
  vs. siSCR (CTRL_NT) (n = 4) samples in MiaPaCa-2 cells, showing negative enrichment
  of the Reactome homologous recombination repair pathway. (D) Western blot showing
  validation of HuR fractions in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments; and HuR-IP
  in MiaPaCa-2 cells. α-Tubulin was used as a control for cytoplasmic extracts and
  Lamin A/C was used as a control for nuclear extracts. (E) The Human Clariom D microarray
  was performed from HuR-RNP-IP MiaPaCa-2 samples and was treated with either olaparib
  (10 µM) or gemcitabine (1 µM) for 16 h. A heatmap of log2FC is shown of the genes
  from the Reactome homologous recombination repair pathway from two sets for each
  treatment condition (HuR vs. IgG).'
