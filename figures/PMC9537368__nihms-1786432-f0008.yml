caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes in WT-1 iKrasG12V
  and T-E-2 iKrasG12V after RAS induction at day 0, day 3 and day 5. (A) Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) were compared in the two models over time for patterns of
  expression including quantitatively similar (paired) and ERG-specific (interaction)
  as well as the intersection of the two, in which responses are in the same direction
  but modulated by ERG. (B) Dot plot summary of GSEA enrichment scores, showing several
  RAS responsive pathways, for individual cell lines over time as well as the differential
  expression of the pathway (TE/WT), (C) High throughput confocal imaging to measure
  senescence in iKrasG12V cells treated with mTORC or MEK/ERK inhibitors simultaneously
  with RAS induction. BEZ235: PI3K/mTOR inhibitor; Torin 1: mTOR inhibitor; AZD8330:
  MEK inhibitor'
