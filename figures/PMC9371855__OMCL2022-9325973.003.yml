caption: IDOAMP inhibits Aurora kinase A and promotes RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL necrosome activation.
  (a) Inhibition of Aurora kinase A in the presence of IDOAMP after 24 h of incubation.
  (b) Co-IP analysis of the level of RIPK1 binding to FADD, RIPK3, and MLKL in PC3
  cells. (c) Co-IP analysis of the levels of Aurora kinase A binding to RIPK1 and
  RIPK3 in PC3 cells following treatment with IDOAMP for 24 h. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. the control group.
