caption: NNMT affected multiple metabolic pathways. (A) Intermediates in glycolysis
  pathway were found downregulated by untargeted metabolomics, suggesting NNMT caused
  glycolysis inhibition which was confirmed by the subsequent proteomic data (n =
  5). (B) Intermediates in TCA cycle markedly accumulated in NNMT-OE cells which was
  confirmed by the subsequent proteomic data (n = 5). (C) Metabolites in tryptophan
  metabolism, among them kynurenine increased by 2-fold and 3-HAA increased by 6-fold
  (n = 4). (D) Most of amino acids were downregulated in NNMT-OE cells except for
  aspartic acid, glutamic acid and glutamine (n = 5). Data were analyzed using Student’s
  t test. ****p < 0.0001. ***p < 0.001. **p < 0.01. *p < 0.05 was considered statistically
  significant. All values represent mean from at least three biological replicates
  ± SD. Fructose-1,6-PP, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. 3-P-glycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate.
  3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine. 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid.
