caption: Core metabolic pathways. (A) Heatmap representing the relative abundance
  of the 21 pathways belonging to this category. (B) Associations between corrected
  GA and pathway abundance. Differences calculated using MaASLin2. Model included
  the superclass or subclass and corrected GA as fixed effects, and infant as random
  effect. Analyses included 42 stool samples (21 in each group) from 27 infants. *Denotes
  the pathways that belonged to the subclass of cofactor, carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis.
  GA, gestational age; MaASLin2, Microbiome Multivariable Association Linear Models;
  MOM, mother's own milk; PWY, pathway.
