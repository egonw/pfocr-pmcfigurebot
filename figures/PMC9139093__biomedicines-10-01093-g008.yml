caption: 'HT29 treatment with XAV939 or miFZD4 inhibits the EMT process initiated
  by treating U937 cells with IFNγ. HT29 cells were treated with XAV939 or miFZD4
  and then co-cultured for 3 days with U937 cells that had been pre-treated with IFNγ
  for 4 days: (a) Graphs show the protein expression of EMT markers and βCATENIN in
  HT29 treated with XAV939 during the co-culture with U937-IFNγ cells. The images
  correspond to a representative Western blot (n ≥ 11 per experimental group). The
  bars in the graphs represent mean ± SEM, and significant differences vs. HT29-IFNγ-treated
  U937 cells are shown by ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. (b) Graphs show the protein
  expression of EMT markers and βCATENIN in HT29 cells pre-treated with miFZD4 or
  mock vectors and subsequently co-cultured with U937 cells. Images correspond to
  a representative Western blot (n = 12 per experimental group). Bars in graphs represent
  mean ± SEM, and significant differences vs. HT29-mock cells are shown by ** p <
  0.01.'
