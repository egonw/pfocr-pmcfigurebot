caption: Identification of phosphorylated proteins in lung cancer cells in response
  to MSC-CM via quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis.A, the overall workflow for
  establishing the phosphoproteomic profile of LM cells in response to short-term
  MSC-CM treatment. T represents the MSC-CM–treated group, and C represents the Control-CM–treated
  group. B, the total number of identified phosphosites, phosphopeptides, and phosphoproteins
  across all time points. C, the number of phosphopeptides with singly, doubly, triply,
  quadruply, and quintuply phosphorylated residues. D, the percentages of phosphorylated
  serine (phoSerine), threonine (phoThreonine), and tyrosine (phoTyrosine) in all
  identified phosphosites. E, the kinases associated with the phosphorylated sites
  that were significantly upregulated after being treated with MSC-CM were predicted
  and are presented as a kinase–substrate network. The color of squares indicates
  the relative levels of phosphoproteins (MSC-CM treatment/Control-CM treatment).
  CM, conditioned medium; LM, low-motility; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell.
