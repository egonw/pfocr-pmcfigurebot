figure_title: Dietary yeast may influence metabolic status via miRNA
caption: 'The female of B. dorsalis were fed with or without dietary yeast for 4 days.
  Whole bodies of flies were homogenized in PBST solution, and then the contents of
  TAG (A), glycogen (B) or total sugar content (glucose plus trehalose) (C) were detected.
  The results were normalized to the total protein content. Boxplots show the data
  of seven independent biological replicates (n = 5 flies for each replicate). Asterisks
  indicate significant differences by Student’s t-test (****, P < 0.0001; *, P < 0.05).
  (D-D’) Nile-red staining of the lipid droplets in the fat body of females. Pictures
  were obtained with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Scale bar: 20 μm), and the lipid
  droplet size was quantified using ImageJ. “yeast-” and “yeast+” indicate the absence
  and presence of yeast in the diet, respectively. (E) RNAi efficiency of miRNA biosynthesis
  pathway-related genes AGO1 and DCR1 at 48 h post dsRNA microinjection. Data are
  expressed as means ± SEM of four independent replicates (***, P < 0.001; **, P <
  0.01). (F-H) Effects of AGO1 and DCR1 RNAi on the metabolic content. (G) TAG content.
  (H) glycogen content. (I) total sugar content (glucose plus trehalose).'
