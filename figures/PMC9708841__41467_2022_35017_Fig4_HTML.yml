figure_title: Triacylglycerol to cholesteryl ester pathway in the liver
caption: Fluxes through reactions of the pathway are negatively associated with triacylglycerol
  levels in LDL and HDL and positively associated with the percentage of cholesteryl
  esters in HDL. Fluxes through reactions disrupting the pathway have the opposite
  effect. Transport processes and some metabolites (e.g., glycerol) have been omitted
  for clarity. CEPTE ethanolamine phosphotransferase, CEPTC choline phosphotransferase.
