caption: Schematic illustration of the experimental protocol. Eleven subjects performed
  an incremental exercise to exhaustion either in normoxia (Nx; FIO2 = 0.21) or in
  severe normobaric hypoxia (Hyp; FIO2 = 0.104) in random order. A resting skeletal
  muscle biopsy was obtained from the m. vastus lateralis before warm-up, followed
  by an incremental exercise test until exhaustion. Immediately at exhaustion, one
  leg was occluded at 300 mmHg and maintained during 60 s. Subsequent biopsies were
  taken from the occluded leg at 10 s and 60 s of occlusion in both trials (Nx and
  Hyp). In the test performed in hypoxia, the biopsies were taken bilaterally from
  the occluded leg and the leg recovering with free circulation 60 s after exercise
  cessation, while the subjects recovered breathing normoxic air.
