caption: Glut1-related glycolysis is involved in regulating macrophage inflammatory
  factors. (A) The peritoneal macrophages of wild-type and STING-KO mice were separately
  extracted and pre-incubated with Bay-876 for 30 minutes. After stimulation with
  IL-4, the expression of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway molecules changed. (b)
  The peritoneal macrophages of wild-type and STING-KO mice were extracted separately
  and pre-incubated with Bay-876 for 30 minutes. After stimulation with Pan-02 supernatant,
  the expression of cGAS-STING signaling pathway molecules changed. (c, d) After the
  above stimulation, the transcription level and release changes of inflammatory factors
  related to M1-macrophage were detected. The experiments were repeated three times,
  and each experiment was triplicated.
