caption: Schematic representation of the Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling
  is activated when a NOTCH ligand binds to a NOTCH receptor on an adjacent cell.
  This triggers ADAM10/17 to perform an S2 cleavage of the NOTCH receptor. γ-secretase
  then catalyzes an S3 cleavage of the receptor, which releases the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) from the cell membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and forms
  a complex with DNA-binding transcription factors such as Recombination Signal Binding
  Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J Region (RBPJ) and Mastermind Like (MAML), resulting
  in transcription of downstream effectors such as HES1. When cells are exposed to
  γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), such as DAPT or MK-0752, S3 cleavage of the NOTCH
  receptor does not occur, preventing release of the NICD. Created with BioRender.com.
