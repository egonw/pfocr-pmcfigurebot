  acid 4-hydroxylase; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; HPPR, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  reductase; RAS, rosmarinic acid synthase; CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; HMGR,
  hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzymeA reductase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate reductoisomerase;
  GGPPS, 1-geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; IPI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase;
  KS, kaurene synthase.
