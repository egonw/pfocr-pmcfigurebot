caption: 'Antitumor effects of UBE + PEM combined treatment versus no treatment in
  lung cancer cells with and without SOCS1 knockdown. (a) qRT-PCR detected SOCS1 expression
  levels in cells with and without treatments. (b) MTT detecting cell proliferation.
  (c) Invasion and (d) migration of the PC-9 and A549 cells without treatment (shNC),
  with UBE + PEM combined treatment but no SOCS1 knockdown (UBE + PEM + shNC) and
  with UBE + PEM combined treatment and SOCS1 knockdown (UBE + PEM + shSOCS1). (e)
  Flow cytometry showing the apoptosis of the shNC cells, UBE + PEM + shNC cells,
  and UBE + PEM + shSOCS1 cells. (f) Flow cytometry showing cell cycle changes. (g,
  h) Pathway analysis via Western blot of corresponding protein expression and their
  histogram representation of the shNC cells, UBE + PEM + shNC cells, and UBE + PEM + shSOCS1
  cells. ∗P < 0.05 for comparison between the treatment groups and the sham group;
  #P < 0.05 for comparison between the 1 mg/ml UBE group and the UBE + PEM group.'
