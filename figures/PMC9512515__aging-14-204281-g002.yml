caption: Morphological changes in NB4 cells after exposure to different concentrations
  of realgar for 24 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of realgar
  for 24 h, and typical images were captured by a light field microscope. (A) Control
  cells; (B) cells exposed to 12.5 μg/ml of realgar; (C) cells exposed to 25.0 μg/ml
  of realgar; (D) cells exposed to 50.0 μg/ml of realgar; and (E) cells exposed to
  75.0 μg/ml of realgar. Inset, magnified cells.
