caption: Prevention of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and oxidative damage through
  the SIRT3-FOXO3a signaling pathway by SBP and TSP followed with cell incubation
  for 48 h and finally exposure to 250 μM H2O2. (A) SBP or TSP effect on SIRT3 and
  FOXO3a protein expression. (B) PC-12 cells’ mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induced
  by H2O2 in SBP and TSP attenuated manner. Data are expressed as the means ± SD (n
  = 3), results marked with different letters (a, b, c and d) are significantly different
  (p < 0.05).
