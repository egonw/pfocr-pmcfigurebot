caption: 'Effect of HCAR1 on MCF7 cell energy metabolism. (A-C) After 20 mM lactate
  treatment for 12 h, WT or KO MCF7 cell lysates were used to estimate the activities
  of the key enzymes for the glycolytic pathway. (A) PFK, (B) HK and (C) PK were assessed
  by respective enzyme activity kits according to the manufacturer''s protocol. All
  data are presented as the mean ± SD from three replicates. (D) mRNA expression levels
  of key glycolytic enzymes were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. All data are presented as the mean ± SD from three replicates. (E-H) The (E
  and G) ECAR and (F and H) OCR were determined by extracellular flow analysis using
  a Seahorse Bioscienses XF96 analyzer in HCAR1 (E and F) overexpressing or (G and
  H) KO MCF7 cells. Experiments were repeated three times and six parallel wells were
  set in each experiment. #P<0.05 compared with non-lactate treatment group; *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 compared with WT group. HCAR1, hydroxyl carboxylic acid
  receptor 1; WT, wild-type; KO, knockout; PFK, phosphofructokinase; HK, hexokinase;
  PK, pyruvate kinase.'
