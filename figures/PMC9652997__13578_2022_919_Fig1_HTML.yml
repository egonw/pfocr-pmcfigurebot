caption: The effect of dietary methionine restriction on mTOR signaling and cancer
  progression. A Schematic of experimental design using HCC PDX model. Treatment,
  n = 5 mice per group. B Tumour growth curves and images of tumours at the end point
  (Day 28). C Survival analysis of mice under Ctrl or MR conditions. D Heatmap displaying
  global transcriptional changes of liver tissues between Ctrl and MR described in
  A. Red color represents the genes’ expression upregulated, while blue means the
  genes’ expression decreased. E KEGG pathway enriched for up-regulated and down regulated
  genes of liver tissues by comparing Ctrl to MR conditions. F Migration of SNU449
  cells (left panel) with quantification data on the right panel. G Sphere formation
  efficiency of SNU449 cells (left panel) with quantification (right panel). H, I
  Tumour volumes and survival analysis of mouse allografts. n = 5 mice per group.
  Data are means ± SEM. Group differences were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t
  test (B, C), two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (F, G, H)
  or log-rank test (I) (**p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001). n.s., not significant. Ctrl,
  Control and MR, Methionine restriction
