caption: ELDR changes transcriptome profile in NOK.A, ELDR plasmid DNA was stably
  transfected, treated with G418, and pooled as an established cell line (NOK-ELDR).
  Relative expression of ELDR in stably overexpressed cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
  Technical triplicates were used, and 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. Small
  bar indicates standard error (∗∗∗p < 0.001). B, global changes in transcriptome
  profile of 15,219 genes in ELDR overexpressed cells (NOK-ELDR) as compared to control
  NOK. C, list of top 25 genes significantly upregulated or downregulated genes following
  overexpression of ELDR in NOK. D, some top significantly enriched Gene Ontology
  (GO) categories (p< 0.05) under ontology of Biological process; E, molecular function
  in ELDR over expressed NOK. F, pathway analysis showed cell cycle regulation as
  most enriched function of genes upregulated in NOK-ELDR cells. The analysis was
  performed using the ToppGene server. The top six enriched functions under each category
  were plotted. ELDR, EGFR long noncoding downstream RNA; NOK, normal oral keratinocytes;
  NOK-ELDR, NOKs stably expressing ELDR.

  keratinocytes through induction of a CTCF-FOXM1-AURKA signaling axis.
