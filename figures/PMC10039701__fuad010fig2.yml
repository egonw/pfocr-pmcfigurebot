caption: 'General model for the regulation of β-lactamases under the control of LysR-type
  regulators, applicable for the intrinsic enzymes of P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae,
  BCC,S. maltophilia, and others. On the left side of the figure, the linkage between
  the LysR regulator (here called AmpR) function and PGN-derived fragments (muropeptides)
  is shown, including a basal situation, as well as induction and mutation-driven
  β-lactamase hyperproduction scenarios. The regularly generated muropeptides proceeding
  from a basal PGN turnover are represented as clear blue cubes. Those muropeptides
  differently appearing and accumulating in qualitative/quantitative terms during
  induction or in a mutational hyperproduction pathway are represented as white cubes.
  On the right side of the figure, the concomitant activation of the CreBC system
  contributing to AmpC-dependent resistance output is shown, displaying the particularities
  of S. maltophiliavs.P. aeruginosa. Abbreviations. OM: outer membrane; PGN: peptidoglycan;
  and IM: inner membrane.'
