caption: ALDOA regulates EGFR signaling pathway in GC cells. A, B. Western blot analysis
  of the indicated proteins in AGS cells (NC vs. KD). The bands were quantified and
  presented as the mean ± SEM. C, D. Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins
  in MKN45 cells (VEC vs. OE). The bands were quantified and presented as the mean
  ± SEM. E. Western blot analysis of the EGFR in MKN45 cells (VEC vs. OE) transfected
  with EGFR-specific siRNA (siE) or control-siRNA-transfected cells (siCon). GAPDH
  was used as a loading control. F. The growth curves of MKN45 cells (VEC vs. OE)
  transfected with EGFR-specific siRNA (siE) or control-siRNA-transfected cells (siCon).
  N, nonsignificant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. The original Western blots
  are included in the  and .
