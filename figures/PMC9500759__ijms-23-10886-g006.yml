caption: Differential metabolite correlation network in positive mode (a) and Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment (b). The vertical axis
  in the bar graph represents each KEGG metabolic pathway, and the horizontal axis
  represents the number of differentially expressed metabolites contained in each
  KEGG metabolic pathway. The color represents the p-value of the enrichment analysis,
  and the darker the color is, the smaller the p-value and the more significant the
  degree of enrichment. The number on the column represents the enrichment factor,
  and the enrichment factor represents the ratio of the number of differential metabolites
  in the pathway to the number of annotated metabolites in the pathway.
