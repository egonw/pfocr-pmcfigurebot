caption: Overexpression of HIF-1α promotes the migration and proliferation of pMVECs.
  (A) Western blot analysis of HIF-1α in pMVEC with overexpressing GAL4 or HIF-1α.
  OE-GAL4, overexpressing GAL4; OE-HIF-1α, overexpressing HIF-1α. n = 3 biological
  replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented
  as the mean ± SEMs. (B) Immunostaining of HIF-1α and Lamin A/C in pMVECs with overexpressing
  GAL4 or HIF-1α. Right, the quantitative data of mean fluorescence intensity of HIF-1α
  in the nucleus. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test
  was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 50 μm. (C) Heatmap
  showing the relative expression level (row-scaling) of DEGs in pMVECs with overexpressing
  HIF-1α versus GAL4. (D) Representative GO terms and pathways of upregulated and
  downregulated DEGs in pMVECs with overexpressing HIF-1α versus GAL4. (E) GSEA showing
  HIF-1 signaling pathway (top) and HIF-1α target genes (bottom) enriched in pMVECs
  with overexpressing GAL4 or HIF-1α. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false
  discovery rate. (F) Venn plots showing the numbers of shared upregulated (left)
  and downregulated (right) DEGs, and representative GO terms and pathways of shared
  upregulated DEGs in pMVECs treated with Que and overexpressing HIF-1α. (G) RT-qPCR
  analysis of shared upregulated genes RORA and LDHA in pMVECs treated with Que or
  overexpressing HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s
  t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. (H) Immunostaining of
  Ki67 and quantification of Ki67-positive cells in pMVECs with overexpressing GAL4
  or HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was
  used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 20 μm. Arrows indicate
  Ki67-positive cells. (I) Immunofluorescence staining of Phospho-H3 (Ser10) and the
  quantification of Phospho-H3 (Ser10)-positive cells in pMVECs with overexpressing
  GAL4 or HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test
  was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 25 μm. Arrows indicate
  Phospho-H3 (Ser10)-positive cells. (J) Clonal expansion analysis of pMVECs with
  overexpressing GAL4 or HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t-test was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. (K) Wound scratch
  assay for detecting the migration ability of pMVECs with overexpressing GAL4 or
  HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used
  and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs. Scale bars, 100 μm. (L) Angiogenesis
  was assessed by the formation of capillary-like tubes of pMVECs with overexpressing
  GAL4 or HIF-1α. n = 3 biological replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test
  was used and data are presented as the mean ± SEMs.Scale bars, 100 μm. (M) NO production
  ability of pMVECs with overexpressing GAL4 or HIF-1α by FACS analysis. n = 3 biological
  replicates. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used and data are presented
  as the mean ± SEMs.
