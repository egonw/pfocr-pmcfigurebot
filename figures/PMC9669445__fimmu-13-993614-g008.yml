caption: DHA inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways at 4 h post-LPS treatment. (A)
  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using the Seurat FindMarkers
  function, with thresholds set to select genes with >1.5-fold change in gene expression
  and genes expressed in at least 25% of groups being compared. DEGs in the “Down
  with DHA” circle of the Venn diagram are downregulated in DHA.LPS.4 relative to
  Veh.LPS.4 and DEGs in the “Up with LPS” circle of the Venn diagram are upregulated
  in Veh.LPS.4 relative to Veh. The intersection represents LPS-induced genes suppressed
  by DHA at 1h. (B) The Enrichr database was used to identify GO Biological Process
  terms for the indicated groups of genes. Shown are the five most enriched pathways
  are shown, as determined by the size of the adjusted p-value. (C) Selected input
  genes enriched in the “Cellular response to LPS” and (D) “Cytokine-mediated signaling
  pathway” GO terms are depicted using the Seurat DotPlot feature, where the size
  of the dot indicates the percent of cells expressing the gene and the depth of the
  dot color indicates the average expression of the gene across the cells in which
  it is expressed.
