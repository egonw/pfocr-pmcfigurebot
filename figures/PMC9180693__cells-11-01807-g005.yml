caption: Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in specific cell clusters.
  (A) Schematic representation of the analysis pipeline. Human cell clusters from
  EC and SFG are compared between Braak Stage 6 and 0, and zebrafish cell clusters
  were compared between amyloid-beta-42 injection versus controls. The common KEGG
  pathways for differentially expressed genes are shown in yellow, zebrafish-specific
  hits are blue, and human-specific hits are in green. The other category includes
  the hits that are present only in one human brain region, but not in the other.
  (B) Neuronal and astroglial cell clusters are compared for the KEGG pathway changes.
  Strikingly, the neuronal clusters in human and zebrafish respond to AD in a highly
  similar fashion in terms of altered KEGG pathways (B), while astroglia have more
  species-specific responses than common (C). See .
