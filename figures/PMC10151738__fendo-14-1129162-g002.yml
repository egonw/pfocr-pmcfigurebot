caption: 'GART and glutamine levels in breast cancer. (A) Kaplan-Meier plots showing
  the relapse-free survival (RFS) probability in women carrying breast tumors expressing
  either ERα-negative (A) or ERα-positive (B) BC as a function of GART mRNA levels.
  Data have been downloaded by the website (https://kmplot.com/analysis/). All possible
  cutoff values between the lower and upper quartiles are automatically computed (i.e.,
  auto-select best cutoff on the website), and the best performing threshold is used
  as a cutoff (). Significant differences between the RFS are given as p-value in
  each panel. (B) GART mRNA levels in breast tumors versus normal breast epithelium
  as downloaded by TNM plot (https://tnmplot.com/analysis/) database (). **** (p <
  0.0001) indicates significant differences as calculated by the Student t-test. GART
  mRNA levels in BC as a function of ERα expression (D) or the histological type of
  the tumor (E) downloaded by the cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/) database.
  IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma. Not-IDC: other kinds of tumors. Each dot represents
  one tumor. **** (p < 0.0001) indicates significant differences as calculated by
  the Student t-test. GART immunohistochemical analysis in tissue slides (F) and relative
  quantitation (F’) in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) stratified as ERα-negative
  and ERα-positive. p-value for differences is given in the panel. Dots represent
  the number of the analyzed tumors. (G) Glutamine levels in different breast tumors
  as downloaded by the Breast Cancer landscape (https://www.breastcancerlandscape.org/)
  () and stratified both as ERα-negative or ERα-positive. ** (p < 0.01) indicates
  significant differences as calculated by the Student t-test. Each dot of the plots
  in (G) represents the value of the indicated parameter in a single breast tumor.
  Glutamine levels in different BC cell lines as downloaded by the DepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal)
  and stratified both as ERα-negative or ERα-positive (H) and as invasive ductal carcinoma
  (IDC) or not (Not-IDC) cell lines classified as ERα-negative or ERα-positive (I).
  * (p < 0.05) indicates significant differences as calculated by the Student t-test.
  Each dot of the plots in (H, I) represents the value of the indicated parameter
  in a single breast cancer cell line.'
