caption: 'DO, GO and KEGG analyses in differential genes. (A) 30 categories of diseases
  associated with differential genes based on DO analysis. (B) GO analysis shows the
  signaling pathways enriched in BP, MF and CC in NSCLC. (CC: cellular component,
  MF: molecular function, BP: biological process, the color represents the significance
  of the data, the redder the color means the more significant the differential genes
  are enriched in this pathway). (Câ€“D) Analysis of KEGG-based enriched signaling pathway.'
