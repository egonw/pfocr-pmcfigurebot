caption: Pathway content of metabolite modules. (A) Pathway annotations of metabolites
  per module at the superpathway level. Superpathways are represented on the x-axis
  by color-coded bars. The percentage of molecules annotated to each superpathway
  placed in each module is indicated on the y-axis; for example, 15% of all acetylated
  peptides are situated within the cyan module. (B) Pathway content of the green metabolite
  module (n = 44), which was found to be inversely correlated with CMV infection.
  Annotations were derived from the files supplied by Metabolon. The inner circle
  represents the superpathway level (same colour-coded categories as in (A)) and the
  outer one denotes the subpathway level. An interactive version of this figure, and
  the corresponding figures of all other modules, can be found in the .
