  EP300 and CREBBP
caption: 'Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic
  efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory. The convergence of these
  pathways, illustrated here, at the level of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway
  may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).

  RD, Iyengar R, Landau EM (2005); Postsynaptic signaling networks: Cellular cogwheels
