figure_title: Suppression of oxidative PPP lowers NADPH level
caption: 'Simple schematic of the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). The G6PD inhibitor (G6PD‐i) inhibits the oxidative bypass pathway coupling
  glycolysis to the PPP.Bar graph showing the viability of GR cells exposed to various
  concentrations of CDDP and GEM for 48 h and treated with DMSO or G6PD‐i (10 μM)
  (left: T24GR, right: UMUC3GR). The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3,
  biological replicates) and were analyzed by Student''s t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001.Total NADPH levels in T24GR and UMUC3GR cells after 48 h of exposure
  to DMSO or G6PD‐i (10 μM). The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological
  replicates) and were analyzed by Student''s t‐test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.NADPH/NADP
  ratio in T24GR and UMUC3GR cells after 48 h of exposure to DMSO or G6PD‐i (10 μM).
  The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates). Data
  were analyzed by Student''s t‐test and are plotted relative to the levels in DMSO
