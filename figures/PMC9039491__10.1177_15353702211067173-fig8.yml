caption: GO and KEGG pathway analysis for AC019117.2. (a) The bubble plot indicated
  a significantly enriched GO pathway. (b) The bar plot delineated a significantly
  enriched KEGG pathway. AC019117.2 and its target mRNAs were conducive to the modulation
  of several signaling pathways to enhance GC progression. (A color version of this
  figure is available in the online journal.)
