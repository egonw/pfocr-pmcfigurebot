caption: Global view of NX210c’s mechanism of action. In the present study, we demonstrated
  that NX210c triggered synaptic transmission through GluN2A-NMDAR and AMPAR, and
  even NMDAR-driven signaling, as shown by the increase in pCREB cerebral content
  after repeated administrations of the peptide in vivo. In addition, we previously
  showed that NX210c promoted neuronal survival and prevented neurite network retraction
  against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and by disrupting apoptosis
  in primary cultures of human and rat neurons. The neuroprotective effect of NX210c
  was abolished in the presence of an anti-β1-integrin receptor antibody []. Collectively,
  we believe that NX210c has a unique multifunctional mechanism of action for the
  treatment of synaptopathy and neurodegeneration—common features of neurological
  disorders that disrupt neural circuits and the execution of motor and cognitive
  functions.
