caption: Influence of differential metabolites on the metabolic pathways of distinct
  C. album cultivars. Each dot represents a metabolic pathway. Ordinate values indicate
  the significance of metabolites enriched in this pathway, with higher values reflecting
  greater significance levels. The abscissa indicates the influence level of DAMs
  on the metabolic pathway; the values and dots of highly influenced metabolic pathways
  are larger.
