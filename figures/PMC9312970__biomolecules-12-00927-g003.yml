caption: Effect of cold stress on inflammatory cytokines expression, oxidative stress-related
  indexes and protein levels assessed by Western blot and ELISA. (A) TLR4, iNOS, COX-2,
  TNF-α, HMGB1 and Tubulin protein levels in each group. (B–F) Quantification of expression
  levels based on expression ratios of TLR4/Tubulin, iNOS/Tubulin, COX-2/Tubulin,
  TNF-α/Tubulin and HMGB1/Tubulin. (G–I) The histograms of relative mRNA analysis
  of TLR4/β-actin, TNF-α/β-actin and HMGB1/β-actin. (J–L) The enzyme activity of CAT,
  GSH and content of MDA in the serum of control and cold groups. (M–O) The enzyme
  activity of CAT, GSH and content of MDA in the liver of control and cold groups.
  (P) Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, GCLM and Tubulin proteins levels in each group. (Q–U)
  Quantification of expression levels based on expression ratios of Nrf2/Tubulin,
  HO-1/Tubulin, NQO1/Tubulin, GCLC/Tubulin and GCLM/Tubulin. (V–Z) The histograms
  of relative mRNA analysis of Nrf2/β-actin, HO-1/β-actin, NQO1/β-actin, GCLC/β-actin
  and GCLM/β-actin. (a) Immunohistochemical scans of Nrf2. (Scale bar = 50 µm). (b)
  Average optical density values of Nrf2 proteins. Data are presented as mean ± standard
  (n = 6). NS means not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
