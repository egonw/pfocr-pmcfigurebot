caption: 'Effect of UA and DOX on cell cycle distribution in HCT116 and HT-29 CRC
  cells. (A) UA and DOX were applied to CRC cells to assess cell cycle distribution.
  (B) Cell cycle-associated protein (CDK and cyclin D1) levels were assessed by western
  blotting following combination treatment for 48 h in the HCT116 and HT-29 cell lines.
  Values were normalized to GAPDH. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control, #P<0.05, ##P<0.01.
  vs. UA/DOX. CONT, control; UA, ursolic acid; DOX, doxorubicin; CRC, colorectal cancer;
  CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ns, not significant.'
article_title: Inhibition of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis by ursolic acid and doxorubicin
  is mediated by targeting the Akt signaling pathway and activating the Hippo signaling
  pathway.
