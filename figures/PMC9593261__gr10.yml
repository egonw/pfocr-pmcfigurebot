caption: Global metabolite profiling in hybrid and parental genotypes(A) Heatmap representing
  metabolite changes in term of log2 fold change (ratio) of normalized area, (B) pathway
  enrichment of metabolites commonly identified in hybrid and parental genotypes,
  (C) pathway map of significantly enriched pathways, and (D–J) metabolites with significantly
  high and low response ratio compared to both parents Choco and Frut4. Metabolite
  response difference between Choco vs. hybrid, Frut4 vs hybrid and Fru4 vs. Choco
  are represented as a, b, and c, respectively and the significant level are indicated
  as ∗ for p value <0.5, ∗∗ for p value <0.01 and ∗∗∗ for p value <0.001.
