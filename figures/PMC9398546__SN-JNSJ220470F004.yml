caption: 'Bidirectional plasticity coexists in LGN and Area 21a with hierarchical
  progressive patterns. A, B, Two typical LGN neurons exposed to biased-adaptation
  stimulation. For each case, orientation tuning curves of two typical cases, colors
  of lines indicate biased-adaptation probabilities, arrows indicate the orientations
  of adaptors (left); trained response curves of two typical cases (right). C, Population
  trained response change ratios of LGN neurons exposed to biased-adaptation stimulation.
  D, Proportion of potentiation-exhibiting, adaptation-only, and unclassified neurons
  in LGN. E, Population trained response change ratios of tested LGN neurons during
  early, middle, and late epoch of biased-adaptation stimulation. F, Population trained
  response change ratios of LGN neurons with the lesion of Area 17. G, H, Two typical
  Area 21a neurons exposed to biased-adaptation stimulation. For each case, orientation
  tuning curves of two typical cases; colors of lines indicate biased-adaptation probabilities,
  and arrows indicate the orientations of adaptors (left); peak response curves of
  two typical cases (right). I, Population peak response change ratios of Area 21a
  neurons exposed to biased-adaptation stimulation. J, Proportion of potentiation-exhibiting,
  adaptation-only, and stable neurons in Area 21a. K, Population peak response change
  ratios of tested Area 21a neurons during early, middle, and late epoch of biased-adaptation
  stimulation. L, Population peak/trained response change ratio curves of LGN, Area
  17, and Area 21a shown in one figure for comparison. Data are adopted from H and
  , C and I. Colored lines indicate brain regions. Error bars indicate SEM; ***p <
  0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. n.s.: not significant (p ≥ 0.05).'
