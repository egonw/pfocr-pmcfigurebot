caption: Correlation between RACGAP1 expression and survival of LUAD patients. (a)
  The correlation between RACGAP1 expression and OS of LUAD patients was analyzed
  using GEPIA. (b–d) The correlation between RACGAP1 expression and OS, PFS, or PPS
  of LUAD patients was analyzed through the Kaplan–Meier Plotter. OS, overall survival;
  PFS, free-progression survival; PPS, post-progression survival.
