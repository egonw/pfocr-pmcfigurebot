caption: TMEM44‐AS1 induced GC resistance to 5‐FU by suppressing the P53 pathway.
  A) TMEM44‐AS1 silencing efficiency was measured through RT‐qPCR following si‐TMEM44‐AS1#1
  and si‐TMEM44‐AS1#2 infection. B) Proliferative abilities of HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R
  cells subject to TMEM44‐AS1 siRNAs or si‐NC transfection were measured through EdU
  assay. Scale bar, 20 µm. C) The cell apoptosis rate for both HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R
  cells was assessed through flow cytometry. D) ABCC1, ABCG2, Survivin, Caspase3,
  cleaved caspase‐3, and GAPDH protein expression was detected through WB in two 5‐FU‐resistant
  cell lines following transfection with TMEM44‐AS1 siRNAs or si‐NC. E) P53, AIFM2,
  Bcl‐2, Bax, and GAPDH protein expression in HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells subject
  to TMEM44‐AS1 siRNAs or si‐NC treatment. F) RT‐qPCR was used to detect the overexpression
  effect of TMEM44‐AS1 after infection with Lv‐TMEM44‐AS1. G) 5‐FU (5 μg mL−1) was
  added to cell medium, cell proliferation ability of HGC‐27/S and MKN‐45/S transfected
  with Lv‐TMEM44‐AS1 or Lv‐NC was detected by CCK8 assay. The relative proliferative
  rates at different time points were normalized to 0 h. H) Cell apoptosis rate was
  detected for both sensitive cells by flow cytometry analysis. I) Protein expression
  levels of ABCC1 and ABCG2, Survivin, Caspase3, cleaved caspase3, and GAPDH were
  detected by western blotting after both sensitive cell lines were transfected with
  Lv‐TMEM44‐AS1 or Lv‐NC. J) Protein expression levels of P53, AIFM2, Bcl‐2, Bax,
  and GAPDH in HGC‐27/S and MKN‐45/S cells treated with Lv‐TMEM44‐AS1 or Lv‐NC. 5 µg
  mL−1 5‐FU was used to treat cells for a 48‐h period before EdU assay, CCK8 assay,
  flow cytometric analysis, and protein extraction. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3. *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
