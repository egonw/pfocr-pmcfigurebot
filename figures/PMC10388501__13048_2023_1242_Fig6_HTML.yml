caption: Irisin mediates skeletal muscle-ovary crosstalk and inhibits the IRE1α-TXNIP/ROS-NLRP3
  signaling pathway in TCs. TCs were treated with DHT, in the presence or absence
  various concentrations of irisin. A Cell viability was measured by CCK8. B and D The
  protein (B) and mRNA (D) levels of IRE1α, TXNIP and NLRP3 in TCs were analyzed by
  western blot and qRT-PCR. (C) The expression of NLRP3 in TCs was analyzed by immunofluorescence
  staining (60 ×). E–F TC MDA levels (E) and SOD activity (F) were analyzed using
  an enzymatic colorimetric method. G ROS in TCs was assessed by the DCF-DA probe
  using confocal microscopy (90 ×). Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01.
