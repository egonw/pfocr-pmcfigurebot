caption: 'a, Active response to RAFi in NTT Braf/Pten tumours (7 doses) and resistance
  formation upon 27 doses (CTRL, n = 6; 7 doses n = 8, 27 doses n = 10 tumours). b,
  Characterization of suppressive myeloid cells, T cells and CD103+DCs in Braf/Pten
  tumours actively responding to RAFi (7 doses) and in relapsing tumours, fully resistant
  to RAFi (27 doses) (n = 8 tumours per group; except CD3+ 7 doses, n = 7; CD3+ 27
  doses, n = 9; CD11b+ Gr-1, CD103+ 27 doses, n = 10). Experiment performed twice;
  representative example shown. P-value top row: ** 0.0011, ** 0.0085, ** 0.0014;
  bottom row: ns 0.08, ** 0.0018, *** 0.0003. c, Proliferation FC in Braf/Pten and
  Braf melanoma cell lines (made resistant to TT in vitro) after 72h at indicated
  drug conditions. Line indicating FC in proliferation of NTT cells on lowest drug
  condition (n = technical triplicates), (drug concentration: DMSO CTRL, 100nM, 300nM,
  1μM, 3μM RAFi). d, Proliferation FC of Braf melanoma cell lines after 72h in indicated
  drug conditions of NTT and NTT-Dacarbazine cell lines (n = technical duplicates),
  (drug concentration: CTRL, 10 μg, 50 μg, 100 μg, 500 μg Dacarbazine). e, pERK status
  in CaTCH-isolated NTT and RTT Braf/Pten cell lines, 1-hour post drug exposure. Experiment
  performed twice; representative example shown. f, Treatment response to ACT in matched
  CaTCH isolated NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA tumours (CTRL, n = 3 mice, ACT, n = 5 mice).
  Experiment performed twice; representative example shown. P-value: **** 3E-5, ns
  0.9871. g, h PCA plot displaying top 500 most variable genes for (g) Braf/Pten and
  (h) Braf melanoma tumours. i, Expression of genes comprising the ccIES in sorted
  NTT and RTT Braf/PtenOVA melanoma cells (left, tumours were not exposed to RAFi)
  (all groups n = 3 tumours) and in sorted RAFi/MEKi RTT melanoma cells (all groups
  n = 3 tumours) (right). j, Overall survival stratified based on ccIES expression
  in TCGA melanoma patients (n = 469 patients). k, l Progression-free survival stratified
  based on ccIES expression in patients receiving (k) anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination
  therapy (n = 32 patients) or (l) anti-PD-1 monotherapy (n = 121 patients). m, Correlation
  of ccIES with CD103 score and T cell score in TCGA melanoma patients (n = 469 patients).
  Data in a, b, c, d, f, displayed as mean ± SEM. Data analysis b two-tailed unpaired
  t–test with Welch correction for unequal variance or with Mann-Whitney-U-test if
  not normal distributed f two-way ANOVA. P-value in j-l derived from a Cox proportional
  hazards model using gene score as a continuous variable and analysis in m two-sided
  Pearson Correlation coefficient (PCC). * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, ****
  P < 0.0001, ns = non-significant.'
