caption: Mechanisms of muscarinic inhibition. A, B, Muscarine inhibition of PL input
  is dependent on Gi/o protein-dependent signaling. A, Baclofen (10 μm), which acts
  via GABAB receptors coupled to Gi/o proteins, inhibits fEPSPs evoked by optogenetic
  stimulation of the PL pathway. This inhibition is reversed by the GABAB receptor
  antagonist, CGP55845 (CGP, 2 μm, n = 7, N = 7; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA,
  F(1.029,6.172) = 92.12; p = 5.93 × 10−5). B, Treatment of brain slices with NEM
  (50 μm) for 15 min inactivated Gi/o proteins and blocked muscarine (10 μm) inhibition
  in the PL pathway (n = 4, N = 4). In the same slices, NEM also blocked the inhibitory
  effect of baclofen (10 μm) in this pathway, demonstrating that Gi/o proteins were
  inactive (n = 4, N = 4; one-way ANOVA, F(4,15) = 37.64; p = 1.18 × 10−7). These
  findings suggest that muscarine inhibition in the PL pathway is dependent on Gi/o
  protein-coupled M4 receptors, rather than Gq protein-coupled M3 receptors. C, D,
  An alternative interpretation of these data is that muscarine produces inhibition
  indirectly through an M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inhibitory interneuron
  excitability, which activates GABAB receptors to suppress synaptic transmission.
  NEM would then block muscarine inhibition by blocking GABAB receptor signaling.
  However, application of CGP55845 (2 μm) did not block muscarine inhibition in either
  the PL (2 μm, n = 6, N = 6; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1.077,5.385) = 30.81;
  p = 0.0019) or MTN pathway (2 μm, n = 5, N = 5; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA,
  F(3,12) = 28.36; p = 9.89 × 10−6). These findings indicate that muscarinic inhibition
  of PL and MTN inputs to BLa is not dependent on GABAB receptors. *p < 0.05. **p
  < 0.01.
