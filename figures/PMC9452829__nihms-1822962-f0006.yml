caption: 'Pb-induced hippocampal neurons apoptosis though IP3R-Ca2+-ASK1-p38 signaling
  pathway. a Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with increased concentrations
  of PbAc for 24 h. The activations of ASK1, JNK and p38 were determined by western
  blotting. b, c Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with 50 μM PbAc in the presence
  or absence of pretreatment with 2-APB or BAPTA-AM for 24 h. The activations of ASK1
  and p38 were determined by western blotting. d, e Primary hippocampal neurons were
  treated with 50 μM PbAc in the presence or absence of pretreatment with SB203580
  for 24 h. d Hippocampal neuron apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry analysis.
  e Protein level of cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-xL were determined using western
  blotting. The protein expression was normalized by GAPDH or corresponding total
  protein content. * P < 0.05 and * * P < 0.01, compared to the control group. #P
  < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01, compared to the Pb-treated group.'
