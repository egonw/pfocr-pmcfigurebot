caption: Blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway leads to Reversal of Immune Response in
  LL patients. Flow cytometric analysis showing the increased production of Th1 cytokines,
  (A) IFN-γ and (B) TNF-α on total gated CD3+ T lymphocytes in leprosy patient with
  BL/LL in Unstimulated; Stimulated with M. lep WCL antigen vs. Stimulated with M. lep
  WCL antigen and PD-1 blocked with antibody against it vs. Stimulated with M. lep
  WCL and PD-L1 and L2 blocked with antibodies and also Stimulated with M. lep WCL
  antigen and PD-1 and PD-L1 and L2 blocked with antibodies. Bar graph representation
  showing the increased production of (C) IFN-γ and (D) TNF-α on total gated CD3+
  T lymphocytes in LL patients of leprosy (n = 4). PBMCs isolated from peripheral
  blood were blocked with α-PD-1 or with α- PD-L1/L2 monoclonal blocking antibodies
  separately or in combination and kept in culture for 72 h with or without M. leprae
  WCL antigen. From cultured cells, T cells were analysed for effector cytokine production
  by flow cytometry. Each bar represents a single category. Mean with SEM are shown
  in each bar while P value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Data analysis
  was performed with flowjo software. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney
  test.
