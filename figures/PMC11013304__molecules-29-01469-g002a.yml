caption: ERK pathway was activated in M2-like TAMs induced via the TNBC-cell-conditioned
  medium. (a) Correlation between expression of TGF-β1 and M2 macrophage infiltration
  in breast cancer using TIMER2.0 database. (b–d) After treating M2-like TAMs with
  the media (TCM-SUM159 and TCM-4T1), the protein expression levels of TGF-β1, ERK,
  and p-ERK were evaluated using Western blot analysis. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001.
