caption: Modulating effect of WISP1v1 on the cell invasion in the prostate carcinoma
  PC-3 cells. The invasion ability of PC-3 cells after the ectopic overexpression
  of WISP1v1 (A) and WISP1v2 (B) was determined by in vitro Matrigel invasion assays.
  (C) The protein levels of NDRG1 and EMT markers (N-cadherin, snail, slug, vimentin)
  were determined by immunoblot assays. (D) The mRNA levels of the NDRG1 and EMT markers
  were determined by RT-qPCR. Data were presented as target genes/β-Actin of PC-WISP1v1
  cells relative to PC-DNA cells. (E) The F-actin staining with Texas Red X-Phalloidin
  and the immunofluorescence was recorded using a confocal microscope. (F) The intensities
  were measured along the line from the peripheral to the central of the cells, and
  the quantitative analysis of the F-actin fluorescence intensity of PC-DNA, PC-WISP1v1,
  and PC-WISP1v2 cells (±SE, n = 4). ** p < 0.01.
