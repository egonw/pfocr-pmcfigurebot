figure_title: Mcl-1 and AKT/PI3Kβ inhibitor combination rapidly induces apoptosis
  in PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells
caption: A Crystal violet staining in EVSA-T and HCC70 cells treated with the indicated
  drugs. B Proliferation of EVSA-T and HCC70 cells treated with AZD5991, AZD8186 or
  in combination for 3 days. Cells were counted every 24 h. Data are mean ± SD; n = 3.
  C, D Measurement of apoptosis induction in EVSA-T and HCC70 cells treated with time
  course of AZD5991, AZD8186 or combination for the times indicated and measured by
  Annexin V staining (C), or western blot analysis of cleaved PARP and PI3K pathway
  effector (pAKT S473) (D). Data are mean ± SD; n = 3. Data shown in D are representative
  of two independent experiments.
article_title: AKT-mTORC1 reactivation is the dominant resistance driver for PI3Kβ/AKT
  inhibitors in PTEN-null breast cancer and can be overcome by combining with Mcl-1
  inhibitors.
