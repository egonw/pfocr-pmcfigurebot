caption: 'LINC01537 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells by
  activating the RIPK4-NF-κB pathway. qRT-PCR (A) and Western blot (B) analysis of
  the levels of RIPK4 in si-NC or si-1 BGC-823, and AGS transfected with ectopic RIPK4-overexpression
  plasmid, or empty control. CCK8 assays (B) and colony assays (C,D) were used to
  detect ectopic expression of RIPK4, which rescued the decreased proliferation and
  tumorigenesis ability induced by LINC01537 knockdown. Whether ectopic expression
  of RIPK4 could rescue the decreased migration and invasion ability induced by LINC01537
  knockdown are shown by wound healing assay (E–H) and Transwell assays (migration
  ability shown in (I,J), invasion ability shown in (K,L)). E,G were taken under 10X
  objective lens. I,K were taken under 20X objective lens.NC + Vector: negative control
  + empty vector; NC + RIPK4: negative control + ectopic RIPK4; Si-1 + vector: Si-LINC01537-01
  + empty vector; Si-1+ RIPK4: Si-LINC01537-01 + ectopic RIPK4. One-way ANOVA was
  employed to analyze the statistical differences. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p
  < 0.0001.'
