caption: The activation of PI3K gives rise to the Akt phosphorylation, pAkt activates
  the transformation and decomposition of IP, which breaks down the binding with NF-κB,
  appears as the lower expression of IκB-α, and NF-κB is more activated and transferred
  into the nucleus, and increases the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and iNOS and upregulation
  of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Eventually, ET-1 promotes the proliferation and migration of
  MOVAS. Mice were given GXP tablets (2.43 g/kg·bid for 3 days) 1 h after intragastric
  administration on the 4th day, and under ether inhalation anesthesia, blood was
  taken from the abdominal aorta to obtain medicated serum. GXP may inhibit the proliferation
  and migration of MOVAS by inhibiting the overactivated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway.

  of MOVAS by Suppressing Activated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Signaling Cascade.
