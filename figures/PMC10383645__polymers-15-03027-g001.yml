caption: The metabolic pathway for PHB synthesis and degradation. The enzymes involved
  in PHB synthesis are PhbA (β-ketothiolase), PhbB (Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase), and
  PhbC (PHB synthase). The enzymes involved in PHB degradation are PhbZ (PHB depolymerase),
  Bdh (β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), Acs (Acetyl-CoA synthetase), and PhbA (β-ketothiolase)
  (Created with data previously reported [,,]).
