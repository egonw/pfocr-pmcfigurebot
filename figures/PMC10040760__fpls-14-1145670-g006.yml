caption: Regulation of flavonoids by MYBs and MBW complexes. (A) A proposed model
  for distinct regulation patterns of flavonoids by different MBW complexes in strawberry
  fruits. (B) The phenotype of co-overexpressed FaMYB5 and FaMYB44-like in ‘Xiaobai’.
  35SN (empty vector) was as control, Scale bars represent 10 mm. (C) qRT-PCR analysis
  of relative expression levels of key structural genes of lignin metabolic pathway.
  Error bars are SEs for three replicates, statistical significance was determined
  by Student’s t-test (**, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05).
