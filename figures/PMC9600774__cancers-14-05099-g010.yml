caption: Effect of CC on LPA-Induced mitochondrial respiration. Seahorse tracing of
  the OCR in (A). SKOV3 and (B). OVCAR3 stimulated with LPA, in presence or absence
  of CC for 6 h. Bar graphs represent the means ± SEM of the basal and maximal respiration,
  spare respiratory capacity, ATP production, non-mitochondrial respiration, in (C).
  SKOV3 and (D). OVCAR3 cells treated with LPA ± CC (n = 5/experimental condition,
  repeated twice). * p < 0.05, compared DMSO, ** p < 0.05 compared to LPA, Student’s
  t-test.
