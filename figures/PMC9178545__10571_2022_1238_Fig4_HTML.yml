caption: Metabolites and microorganism pathway in brain–lung axis. The metabolites
  of CNS or lung in various diseases are essential regulators for the interconnection
  between brain and lung axis. Necrotic substances which are released after brain
  or lung injury could damage each other through immune system. What is more, exosomes
  may be communicating messages between brain and lung. Bacteria and their products
  [e.g., outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and LPS] may be another communicating message.
  The bacteria or LPS after lung infection could directly invade brain, resulting
  in CNS infection. Besides, OMVs carrying bacteria toxins could damage BBB, activate
  glial cells and promote neuroinflammation. AD Alzheimer’s disease
