caption: Theasinensin A combined with nimotuzumab enhanced internalization and reduced
  EGFR expression in NCI-H441 cells. (A) Inhibition of the EGFR signal pathway in
  NCI-H441 cells. (B) Quantification of Western blot. The significance level was set
  at p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**) or p ≤ 0.001 (***) vs. combination therapy group.
  (C) Immunofluorescence staining of EGFR (×400). (D) Immunoblot analysis was performed
  for EGFR and downstream signaling protein expression after drug treatment. (E) FACS
  analysis using a PE-conjugated EGFR antibody in NCI-H441 cells. (F) Theasinensin-A-induced
  ubiquitination of EGFR.
