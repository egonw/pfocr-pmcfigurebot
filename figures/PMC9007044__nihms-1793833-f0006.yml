figure_title: Sphingosine promotes glycolysis in macrophages
caption: (A) ECAR of glycolysis, glycolytic reserve, and capacity in WT and NcDase−/−
  macrophages treated with PBS (M0) or LPS + IFN-γ (M1) for 17 h and given sequential
  treatment with oligomycin and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG).(B) ECAR of glycolysis, glycolytic
  reserve, and capacity in WT and NcDase−/− macrophages treated with DMSO (Con) or
  20 μM ceramide (Cer) for 17 h and given sequential treatment with oligomycin and
  2-DG.(C) OCR, basal respiratory capacity, and maximal respiratory capacity in WT
  and NcDase−/− macrophages treated with DMSO (Con) or 20 μM ceramide (Cer) for 17
  h and given sequential treatment with oligomycin, fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone
  (FCCP), and rotenone plus antimycin (Rot + ant).(D) ECAR of glycolysis, glycolytic
  reserve, and capacity in WT and NcDase−/− macrophages treated with DMSO (Con) or
  25 μM sphingosine (SPH) for 3 h and given sequential treatment with oligomycin and
  2-DG.(E) ECAR of glycolysis in LPS-primed or unprimed BMDMs treated with DMSO (Con)
  or 25 μM sphingosine (SPH) for 3 h and given sequential treatment with oligomycin
  and 2-DG. (A–E) Mean ± SEM; *p <0.05 and **p <0.01 (nonparametric t tests). Data
  are representative or pooled results from three independent experiments, total n
  = 6 per group, each dot represents one mouse.(F) The glycolytic pathway (left) with
  the metabolic genes measured highlighted in red. RNA was isolated from macrophages
  and collected at the indicated times after sphingosine treatment and used for qPCR
  analyses of metabolic genes in the glycolytic pathway (right). mRNA levels in resting
  WT macrophages were set to 1. The heatmap represents the fold of the relative mRNA
  expression level (see color scale).(G) ELISA and immunoblotting for IL-1β in supernatants
  of LPS-primed and vehicle-or SPH-stimulated BMDMs in the presence of vehicle or
  OA. (F and G) Data are pooled results from three independent experiments, total
  n = 6 per group, mean ± SEM; **p <0.01.(H) Representative immunoblotting for PP2A
  in the colonic tissue from C. rodentium-infected mice.(I) The activity of PP2A in
  the colonic tissue from C. rodentium-infected mice.(J) ECAR of glycolysis, glycolytic
  reserve, and capacity in WT and NcDase−/− macrophages isolated from colon after
  infection. Data are from (H and I) two or (J) three independent experiments. Total
  n = 6. Error bars represent mean ± SEM. **p <0.01.(K) Immunoblotting for IL-1β,
  procaspase-1, and activated caspase-1 (p10) in supernatants of LPS-primed and vehicle-or
  SPH-stimulated BMDMs in the presence of vehicle or 2-DG.(L) The activity of PP2A
  in LPS-primed macrophages treated with vehicle-or SPH in the presence of vehicle
  or 2-DG. Data are representative (K) or pooled results (L) from three independent
  experiments, each dot represents one mouse, total n = 6 per group. Error bars represent
  mean ± SEM. *p <0.05.
