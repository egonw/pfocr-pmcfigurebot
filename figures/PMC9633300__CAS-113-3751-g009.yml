caption: The interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) signaling pathway was the top enriched pathway
  related to TNBC bone metastasis according to GSEA. Results of GSEA comparing the
  Dor and Par (A) and PDor and Dor (C) groups in GSE20611 by WebGestalt. B, D, The
  IL‐10 signaling pathway was the top‐ranked pathway identified using WebGestalt.
  Heatmap showing the differential expression of genes involved in IL‐10 signaling
  between the Dor and Par groups (E) and the PDor and Dor groups (F). G, Venn diagram
  showing the overlapping genes involved in IL‐10 signaling between the Dor and Par
  and the PDor and Dor groups. H, Venn diagram showing the overlapping genes involved
  in IL‐10 signaling as identified by gene enrichment analysis and GSEA. GSEA, gene
  set enrichment analysis; TNBC, triple‐negative breast cancer
