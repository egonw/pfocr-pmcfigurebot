caption: S1pr2 inhibits AKT/eNOS/NO signaling pathway, and thus reduces EC migration,
  proliferation, and angiogenic activity. A-C. Western blotting of AKT or eNOS activation
  status in HUVECs and quantification in the indicated groups (n = 3). D. S1PR2 inhibits
  the NO production of HUVECs through AKT/eNOS signaling pathway (n = 8). E. S1PR2
  inhibits the ability of proliferation of HUVECs through AKT/eNOS signaling pathway,
  as shown by MTT assay (n = 5). F-I, S1PR2 inhibits the ability of migration of HUVECs
  through AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, as shown by transwell chemotactic assay (F-G)
  and scratch wound healing assay (H-I) (n = 6). J-K, S1PR2 inhibits the ability of
  angiogenic sprouting of HUVECs through AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, as shown by fibrin
  gel bead sprouting assay (n = 5). L and M, S1PR2 inhibits the ability of tube formation
  of HUVECs through AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, as shown by tube formation assay (n
  = 5). LY294002 (LY), AKT inhibitor. L-NAME (LN), eNOS antagonist. O/E, overexpression.
  SH, shRNA. Scale Bars, 200 μm. Data are mean ± SEM. n.s indicates not significant.
