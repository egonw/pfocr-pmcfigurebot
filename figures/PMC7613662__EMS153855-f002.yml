  circadian clock
caption: 'A) Relative expression of circadian clock genes in sort-purified small intestinal
  IgA+ PC at ZT 0, 6, 12 and 18 (ZT0 double plotted), determined by RT-PCR. n=10 (pooled
  from two independent experimental cohorts). Data representative of at least 3 independent
  experiments. B) Frequency and C) numbers of small intestinal IgA+ PC in Mb1Cre/+
  x Arntlfl/fl mice in comparison to Mb1+/+ x Arntlfl/fl littermate control animals,
  n=5 representative of two independent experiments. D) Heatmap comparison of significantly
  differentially expressed genes (Benjami-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05) identified by
  bulk RNA sequencing of sort-purified small intestinal IgA+ PC at ZT0 and 12, and
  found to significantly differ between ZT0 and ZT12 in control animals. Z-scores
  of relative gene expression (fpkm) values in individual animals of n=6 Mb1+/+ x
  Arntlfl/fl mice and n=4-5 Mb1Cre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice per timepoint. Gene clusters:
  I+II (decrease in gene expression between ZT0 + ZT12 in controls, loss of suppression
  in Mb1Cre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice), III (time of day difference retained in both genotypes),
  IV+V (increase in gene expression between ZT0 + ZT12 in controls, loss of suppression
  in Mb1Cre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice) and VI (enhanced time of day difference in Mb1Cre/+
  x Arntlfl/fl mice). E-H) Average z-score values (representative of n=6 Mb1+/+ x
  Arntlfl/fl mice and n=4-5 Mb1Cre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice) in IgA+ PC at ZT0 and ZT12,
  in respect to E) Circadian clock genes, F) Plasma Cell-associated genes, G+H) Metabolism-associated
  genes. ^ identifies genes where time of day differences either did not reach statistical
  significance in control animals in this analysis but were either previously identified
  in  as oscillatory, or are directly related and relevant to the biological pathway
  described. I) Serial fecal sampling of Mb1Cre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice and Mb1+/+ x Arntlfl/fl
  mice at four time points over a circadian day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18; ZT0 double plotted),
  n=8-9 and pooled from two independent experimental cohorts. J) RT-PCR expression
  of pIgR relative to housekeeping gene in whole small intestinal tissue samples (n=5
  mice, represenative of two indepednent experiments). K) Serial fecal sampling of
  VillinCre/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice and Villin+/+ x Arntlfl/fl mice at four time points
  over a circadian day (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18; ZT0 double plotted), n=5 and representative
  of two independent experiments. P values for panels A and I-K were determined using
  JTK Cycle, D-H with Benjami-Hochberg test (DESeq2, see also methods) and panels
  B+C which with a parametric, unpaired t-test. All data shown as +/- SEM unless otherwise
  indicated, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, **** p< 0.0001.'
