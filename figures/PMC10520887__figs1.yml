caption: The interactions of pSTING/pTBK1/pIKKε with pIRF3.A–F, HEK293T cells were
  co-transfected with the indicated plasmids of GFP-pIRF3 together with mCherry-pSTING,
  pTBK1-HA or mCherry-pIKKε for 48 h. Cells were harvested and subjected for Co-IP
  and subsequent Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. G, Schematic
  of full-length pIRF3 and its truncated mutants. DBD, DNA binding domain; IAD, IRF
  association domain; AIE, auto-inhibition element. H, HEK293T cells were co-transfected
  with mCherry-pIKKε and each GFP-pIRF3 truncation mutants for 48 h and then the cells
  were harvested and subjected for Co-IP and subsequent Western blot analysis using
  the indicated antibodies.
