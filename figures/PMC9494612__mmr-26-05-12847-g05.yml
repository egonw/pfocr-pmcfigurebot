caption: 'Effects of M1 macrophages on the expression levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins in liver cancer cells via activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A-C)
  Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and
  caspase-3 in HepG2 cells in RM or CM after treating with or without ADM or treating
  with or without X-rays. (A) Representative western blot image and quantified expression
  levels in (B) the ADM experiment and (C) the X-ray experiment. (D-F) Western blot
  analysis was employed to detect the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3
  in SNU-182 cells in RM or CM after treating with or without ADM or treating with
  or without X-rays. (D) Representative western blot image and quantified expression
  levels in (E) the ADM experiment and (F) the X-ray experiment. All experiments were
  performed in triplicate. ***P<0.001 vs. ADM+RM group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.001, ###P<0.001
