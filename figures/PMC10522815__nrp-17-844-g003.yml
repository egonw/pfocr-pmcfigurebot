figure_title: Effects of fucoidan on the expression of FAK and Src signaling pathway.
  A549 cells were incubated with fucoidan (0–100 µg/mL) for 48 h. (A) Protein expression
  was evaluated by western blotting and normalized with β-actin. (B) Relative pFAK/FAK
  protein expression. (C) Relative pSrc/Src protein expression. All data were expressed
  as mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 4)
caption: FAK, focal adhesion kinase.*P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance
  when compared with the untreated control.
article_title: Antimetastatic effect of fucoidan against non-small cell lung cancer
  by suppressing non-receptor tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase
  pathway.
