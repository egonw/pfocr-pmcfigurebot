caption: Integrin β3 upregulated AXL in NSCLC cells. Effects of stable ectopic expression
  of integrin β3 (+β3) or empty vector control (+Ctrl) on AXL expression in HCC827
  (A) and HCC4006 (B) cells. Effects of knockdown of integrin β3 (shβ3) or nonsilencing
  control (shCtrl) on AXL expression in HCC827 ER (C) and HCC4006 ER (D) cells. β-actin
  was used as a loading control. n = 3 independent experiments.
