figure_title: Genomic regions with overrepresented mutations converge to cancer genes
  and developmental pathways
caption: A. Genomic regions (100-kbps) with overrepresented mutations that significantly
  exceeded the predictions of models informed by CA and RT profiles. Regions with
  significantly higher model residuals are shown (FDR < 0.05). Significant regions
  with known cancer genes are labeled (FDR < 10âˆ’10). Colors indicate the cancer types
  where the overrepresented mutations were found (see panel D). X-axis is capped at
  50 and Y-axis is capped at 400. B-C. Examples of genomic regions with overrepresented
  mutations and known or putative cancer driver mutations. The plots show the genes
  in the region (top), observed and expected mutation burden (SNVs per kbps; middle),
  and the top five most significant predictors in our models (i.e., CA and RT profiles;
  bottom). B. The genomic region encoding the driver gene PIK3CA in breast cancer.
  C. Super-enhancer region at the IRF4-DUSP22 locus with overrepresented mutations
  in breast cancer. D. Pathway enrichment analysis of the genomic regions where the
  mutations were overrepresented compared to CA- and RT-informed predictions. The
  enrichment map visualisation shows significantly enriched biological processes and
  pathways (FDR < 0.05). Nodes in the network represent enriched pathways and processes,
  the edges connect nodes sharing many genes, and the manually annotated sub-networks
  represent functionally related pathways and processes. Colors show the cancer types
  where the pathway enrichments were detected. The pathways and processes that were
  only detected in the joint analysis of multiple cancer types are shown in yellow.
