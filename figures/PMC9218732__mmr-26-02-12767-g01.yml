caption: Knockdown of circ_0006174 significantly restrains the growth, migration and
  invasion of CRC cells. (A) RT-qPCR was performed to examine circ_0006174 expression
  after CRC cells were transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA. (B) CCK-8 test was implemented
  to examine cell growth after transfection with circ_0006174 siRNA. (C) Western blotting
  was used to detect Ki67 expression in CRC cells transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA.
  (D) TUNEL assay was used to examine cell apoptosis rate of CRC cells transfected
  with circ_0006174 siRNA. Transwell assay was exploited to examine cell (E) migration
  and (F) invasion of CRC cells transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA. **P<0.01 and
  ***P<0.001. circ, circular RNA; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR;
  CRC, colorectal cancer; si, small interfering; NC, negative control.
