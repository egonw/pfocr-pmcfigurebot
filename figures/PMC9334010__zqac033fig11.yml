caption: Differential potency of cannabinoids in modulating SOCE across various immune
  cells. (A) Heat map demonstrating IC50 values of cannabinoids against SOCE across
  5 immune cell lines and 1 nonimmunological cell line. Red colored boxes indicate
  higher potency and white boxes indicate lower potency of SOCE inhibition (see table
  legend). (B) Biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids in the Cannabis plant. Arrows
  indicate the direction of metabolism from precursor cannabinoids. (C) IC50 values
  of the top 5 most potent cannabinoids represented in a radar chart. The chart demonstrates
  that certain cannabinoids elicit similar IC50 values between specific types of immune
  cells while other display a differential potency. (D) IC50 values of the nonacidic
  version of the top 5 most potent cannabinoids represented in a radar chart format
  to highlight the difference in potency between these compounds and their acidic
  counterparts in C as well as across the 5 immune cell lines.
