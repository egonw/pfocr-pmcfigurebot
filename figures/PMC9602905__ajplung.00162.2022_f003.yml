caption: 'Acute e-cig exposure affects mRNA expression of target genes in the lung
  analyzed by RT-qPCR. Hamsters were exposed to bias flow (blue), PG/VG + 0% nicotine
  (green), and PG/VG + 2.5% nicotine (red) for 2 days (n = 14–16 animals/group). Target
  mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Expression was normalized to RPL18 and
  calculated relative to the mean expression level of the biological replicates of
  the bias flow group. A: RAAS pathway genes ACE and ACE2. B: coagulation genes tissue
  factor and Serpine-1. C: ECM remodeling genes MMP-2 and MMP-9. D: fibrosis- and
  angiogenesis-/vasculogenesis-related genes TGF-β and VEGF-A. E: type 1 inflammatory
  genes IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-5, and CXCL-10. F: ROS processing gene SOD-2. G: NETosis-related
  gene ELANE. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis
  with Dunn’s post hoc test. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ECM, extracellular
  matrix; IL, interleukin; PG, propylene glycol; NETosis, neutrophil extracellular
  trap release; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VG, vegetable glycerin.'
