caption: 'Neurite outgrowth and BDNF pathway in SH-SY5Y cells under Dexa-induced stress.
  (a) RRE WS®1375 at 5 ng/ml reduced the dexamethasone-induced damage on neurite outgrowth
  in SH-SY5Y cells. Pictures were taken using a digital microscope of a multimode
  plate reader (×20). Immunostaining was performed with βIII-tubulin/Alexa Fluor-488
  for the soma and neurites. The nucleus was stained using DAPI. Pictures display
  neurite extension between the cells (upper panels). Neurite outgrowth parameters
  such as the attachment points (middle panels) and the endpoint numbers (lower panels)
  are illustrated in the untreated cells (CTRL), cells treated with Dexa 100 μM, and
  cells treated with Dexa 100 μM and then with WS®1375 at 5 ng/ml (blue and gray:
  soma; red: neurites; green points: attachment points; and yellow points: endpoints).
  (b–e) Dexa decreased all four parameters of neurite outgrowth compared to control
  (normalized to 100%; dotted line). WS®1375 was able to ameliorate this decrease.
  Quantification was performed using NeurophologyJ. At 5 ng/ml, WS®1375 significantly
  increased: (b) number of neurites (neurite count), (c) neurite length, (d) number
  of attachment points, and (e) number of endpoints under Dexa stress. (f) RRE 5 ng/ml
  modulate the mRNA level of BDNF TrkB and p75NTR under Dexa stress. Values represent
  the mean ± SEM of two independent experiments. A total of 15-21 pictures per condition
  were taken and analyzed. For statistics, one-way ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett''s multiple
  comparison test versus corresponding dexamethasone (dexa) concentration were used.
