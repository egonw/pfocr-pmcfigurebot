caption: Expression patterns of AtCoq9. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of AtCoq9 expression
  levels in different organs. PP2AA3 was used as the internal reference. Data are
  means of three biological replicates Â±SE. (B) Histochemical GUS staining of ProAtCoq9::GUS
  transgenic plants. Shown are 7-day-old seedling, 14-day-old seedling, four-week-old
  plant, and inflorescence. Scale bars, 2 mm.
