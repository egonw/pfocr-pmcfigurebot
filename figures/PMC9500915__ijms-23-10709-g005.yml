caption: 'SH increased NIS-mediated RAI uptake by activation of TSHR/cAMP/CREB/PAX8
  signaling pathway in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells. (A) The expressions of cAMP, pCREB,
  PAX8, and NIS in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells treated with or without 4 mM SH and SQ22536
  for 48 h were determined by Western blot and quantitatively analyzed. (B) RAIU in
  BCPAP and TPC-1 cells was determined in treated cells with or without 4 mM SH and
  SQ22536 for 48 h. KClO4 was used as a selective inhibitor for NIS-mediated iodide
  uptake. ** p < 0.005 vs. control. #Â p < 0.05 vs. relevant group treated by SH only.'
