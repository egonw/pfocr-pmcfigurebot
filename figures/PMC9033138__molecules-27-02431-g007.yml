caption: Nigrosporins B induced autophagic flux in Ca Ski cells. Ca Ski cells transfected
  with mRFP-GFP-LC3 were treated with Nigrosporins B for 18 h. (A) Cells transfected
  with mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus were recorded by a confocal fluorescence microscopy;
  (B) The analysis of red dots and yellow dots in Ca Ski cells (** p < 0.01).
