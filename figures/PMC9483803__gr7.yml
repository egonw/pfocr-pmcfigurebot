caption: PAD4-dependent citrullination of GSK3β promotes degradation of CDKN1A in
  CRC cells. (A) Heat map showing DEGs in HCT116 cells transfected with FLAG-PAD4.
  (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated genes of FLAG-PAD4 transfected
  HCT116 cells. (C) Western blot analysis of CDKN1A expression in simix-GSK3β and
  FLAG-PAD4 co-transfected HCT116 cells. (D) Expression of CDKN1A in cytoplasmic and
  nuclear extracts from simix-GSK3β and FLAG-PAD4 co-transfected HCT116 cells. (E)
  Ubiquitin levels of CDKN1A from cell nucleus in simix-GSK3β and FLAG-PAD4 co-transfected
  HCT116 cells. (F) Schematic diagram of PAD4/GSK3β/CDKN1A signaling axis for CRC
  progression. All the experiments are conducted in three biological replicates.
