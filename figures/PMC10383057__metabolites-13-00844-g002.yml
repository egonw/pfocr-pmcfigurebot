caption: 'Overview of metabolite coverage of IQML: (a) Metabolic KEGG pathways covered
  in our metabolite library showing the number of metabolites from important metabolic
  pathways, which are included. The classification has been performed using KEGG pathway
  Mapper. (b) Metabolite superclasses covered in our metabolite library showing the
  number of metabolites from important metabolite superclasses, which are included.
  The classification has been performed using ClassyFire [].'
