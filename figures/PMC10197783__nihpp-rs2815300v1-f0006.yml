figure_title: G2-115 promotes TFEB function by reducing RCAN1-CaN interaction and
  promoting TFEB nuclear localization
caption: a, Immunoblotting analysis of autophagy inducer-treated fibroblasts with
  anti-phosphor-TFEB (Ser142) antibody. Cells were treated with DMSO, 0.5 μM of G2-115,
  8 mM of metformin, 100 μM of carbamazepine, or 500 nM of rapamycin. b, Representative
  Immunoblotting (top) and quantification (bottom) of phosphor-TFEB (Ser142) in three
  independent HD-MSNs (HD.47, HD.40, HD.45, n=3) treated with DMSO or 0.5μM of G2-115.
  c, Immunoprecipitation analysis of Flag-RCAN1-transfected HEK293 cells with anti-Flag
  antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-CaN antibody. Dose-response of cells
  was measured with 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, and 5 μM of G2-115. d, Immunoprecipitation analysis
  of chloroquine (lysosome inhibitor)-treated fibroblasts with anti-CaN followed by
  immunoblotting with anti-RCAN1 antibody. Cells were treated with DMSO or 0.5 μM
  of G2-115 and 60 μM of chloroquine (lysosome inhibitor), e, Experimental scheme
  of NanoBit binding assay (top). Binding assay of HEK293 cells transfected with RCAN1
  fused to a large Bit and CaN fused to a small Bit. Cells were treated with autophagy
  inducers (2.0 μM of G2-115, 8 mM of metformin, 100 μM of carbamazepine, or 500 nM
  of rapamycin) (bottom), f, Representative image (left) and quantification (right)
  of nuclear TFEB in three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.45, HD.40, n=3) treated
  with DMSO or 0.5 μM of G2-115. Scale bars represent 20 μm. Each dot represents one
  reprogrammed cell positive for TFEB and DAPI. g, Representative images (left) of
  HD-MSNs expressing the tandem monomeric mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporter. Quantification
  (right) of autophagosome and autolysosome from cells having puncta from three independent
  HD-MSNs (HD.40, HD.47, HD.43, n=3) treated with DMSO or 0.5 μM of G2-115. Cells
  were transduced with Control or RCAN1 and measurements were performed in cells having
  puncta (from more than 50 cells per MSN line). Scale bars represent 20 μm. h, Quantification
  of caspase 3/7 activation (top) from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.40, HD.47, HD.45,
  n=11) and annexin V signal (bottom) from three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.47,
  HD.45, n=10~15) treated with DMSO or 0.5μM of G2-115. Cells were transduced with
  Control or RCAN1. i. Representative image (left) and quantification (right) of HTT
  inclusion bodies (IBs) in three independent HD-MSNs (HD.43, HD.40, HD.47, n=3) treated
  with DMSO or 0.5 μM of G2-115. Cells were transduced with Control or RCAN1. Cells
  were immunostained with anti-HTT and TUBB3 antibodies. An average of 300 cells per
  each were counted from three or more randomly chosen fields. Scale bars represent
  10 μm. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA (e,g,h,i) and
  unpaired t-test (b,f); ****p<0.0001, ***p<0.001, **p<0.01, *p<0.05, ns, not significant,
  and mean±s.e.m. Each dot represents one individual’s reprogrammed HD-MSNs (b,g,h,i).
  The sample size (n) corresponds to the number of biological replicates (b,f,g,h,i).
