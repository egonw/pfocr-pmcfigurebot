caption: DEGs were involved in IAA biosynthesis pathway and signaling pathway in CK
  vs. T1 on day 4. (A) DEGs participated in IAA biosynthesis and metabolism pathway.
  (B) DEGs participated in IAA signaling pathway. The different font color represents
  the genes that are regulated in CK vs. T1 (red indicated upregulation; green indicated
  downregulation).
