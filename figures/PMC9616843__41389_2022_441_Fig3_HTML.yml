figure_title: DUSP5P1 activates focal adhesion and MAPK signaling pathway
caption: A KEGG pathways enriched by differentially expressed genes affected by DUSP5P1.
  B Enriched differentially expressed genes of focal adhesion and MAPK signaling pathway.
  C DUSP5P1 re-overexpression promoted focal adhesion and MAPK pathway as evidenced
  by protein expression of factors in MAPK signaling pathway in AGS and GES1 cells
  by Western blot. D DUSP5P1 knockdown inhibited the MAPK pathway as evidenced by
  decreased protein expression of focal and MAPK signaling pathway. E Effect of DUSP5P1
  on gastric cell migration in the presence or absence of FAK inhibitor (VS6063) in
  GES1, MGC803, and BGC823 cells (20μmol/L). F Effect of DUSP5P1 on gastric cell migration
  in the presence or absence of MAPK inhibitor. Effect of DUSP5P1 on gastric cell
  migration in the presence or absence of ERK inhibitor (PD98059) in GES1 (100 μmol/L),
  MGC803 (150 μmol/L) and BGC823 (150 μmol/L); Effect of DUSP5P1 on gastric cell migration
  in the presence or absence of p38 inhibitor (BIRB796) in GES1, MGC803, and BGC823
  (100 μmol/L). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001.
