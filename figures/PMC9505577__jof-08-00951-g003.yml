caption: Response surface and contour diagram of interaction of different factors
  on SW extraction rate. (A,D) Response surface and the contour plot of the interaction
  of extraction time and ultrasonic temperature to SW extraction rate. (B,E) Response
  surface and the contour plot of the interaction of extraction time and formic acid
  concentration to SW extraction rate. (C,F) Response surface and the contour plot
  of the interaction of extraction time and material-solvent ratio to SW extraction
  rate. (G,J) Response surface and the contour plot of the interaction of ultrasonic
  temperature and formic acid concentration to SW extraction rate. (H,K) Response
  surface and the contour plot of the interaction of ultrasonic temperature and material-solvent
  ratio to SW extraction rate. (I,L) Response surface and the contour plot of the
  interaction of formic acid concentration and material-solvent ratio to SW extraction
  rate.
