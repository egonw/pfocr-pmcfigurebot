caption: Simplified diagram illustrating hypothetical processes involving physiological
  compound exocytosis and excessive compound exocytosis leading to the formation of
  a large endocytic vacuole followed by its actination, LC3 conjugation, and trypsinogen
  activation. The opacity of the grey colour reflects the concentration of zymogens.
  The red colour represents polymerised actin, green colour indicates LC3 conjugation,
  blue colour indicates lysosomal cathepsins and dark yellow colour reflects intraorganellar
  activation of trypsinogen (formation of trypsin). (A) Early events involving formation,
  actination, and trafficking of post-exocytic structures and endocytic vacuoles.
  (Aa) Illustrates exocytosis and post-exocytic events in physiological conditions
  (mediated by moderate stimulation with physiological secretagogues). During a physiological
  response, only a few secretory granules participate in the compound exocytosis.
  The small volume of the post-exocytic structure allows nearly complete release of
  the zymogens into the lumen. Signals driving exocytosis are limited in amplitude
  and duration; actination of the post-exocytic structures is sufficiently fast to
  prevent excessive fusion. The small vacuole is trafficked away from the secretory
  region and disassembled. (Ab) Represents excessive compound exocytosis and formation
  of a large endocytic vacuole. These events are initiated by large concentrations
  of secretagogues or bile acids. Signals driving exocytosis (particularly Ca2+ signals)
  are strong and persistent. Actination of the post-exocytic organelle is not sufficiently
  fast and consequently a large number of secretory granules (up to 200) continue
  to fuse with the post-exocytic structure. The fusion pore closes trapping zymogens
  inside a large endocytic vacuole diluted by luminal fluid. Fusion of zymogen granules
  with the endocytic vacuole continues even after the closure of the fusion pore.
  The vacuole disconnects from the apical plasma membrane. The endocytic vacuole is
  finally completely actinated and fusion of secretory granules with the vacuole stops.
  The endocytic vacuole (containing a significant concentration of zymogens) is transported
  from the secretory region into the basolateral part of the cell and sheds its actin
  coat. (B) Illustration of the hypothetical evolution of the endocytic vacuole after
  it sheds actin (i.e., after the events shown in part Aa). Pathway 1 illustrates
  the putative process involving the rupture of an endocytic vacuole (before trypsinogen
  activation). Zymogens in this case are released into the cytosol and could potentially
  be activated in the cytosol. Pathway 2 demonstrates a putative role of LC3 conjugation,
  CASM/LNCA, and lysosomal hydrolases in activating trypsinogen with subsequent vacuolar
  rupture and the release of trypsin into the cytosol. Such a pathway is likely to
  cause cell damage. Pathway 3a illustrates a putative protective role of CASM/LNCA
  against trypsin-induced damage. In this case, trypsinogen is activated (trypsin
  is formed) in the endocytic vacuole independently from LC3 conjugation; LC3 conjugation
  with the subsequent lysosomal fusion results in the destruction of the trypsin by
  lysosomal hydrolases. Pathway 3b. Illustrates another putative protective mechanism
  involving lysosomal fusion. In this case, lysosomes repair the vacuolar membrane
  preventing the rupture of the vacuole and the release of trypsin (or trypsinogen)
  into the cytosol. It is conceivable that both protective mechanisms (shown on 3a
  and 3b) can operate simultaneously.
