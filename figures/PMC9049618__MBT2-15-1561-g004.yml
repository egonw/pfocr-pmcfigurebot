caption: Plasmid combinatorial optimization for 2′‐FL production. A. Schematic design
  of different plasmid combinations. Module I includes manB, manC, gmd and wcaG. Module
  II contains futC and lacY. Both modules were expressed under the control of extremely
  strong (pRSFDuet‐1, denoted by R), relatively strong (pETDuet‐1, denoted by E),
  moderate (pCDFDuet‐1, denoted by D), weak (pACYCDuet‐1, denoted by A) or very weak
  (pCOLADuet‐1, denoted by O) plasmids. B. Influences of modular engineering of 2′‐FL.
  Triplicate experiments were conducted, and error bars denote the standard deviation.
