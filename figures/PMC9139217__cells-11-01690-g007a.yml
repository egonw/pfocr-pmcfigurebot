caption: Melatonin could attenuate the downregulation of MT1, MT2, and SIRT1/Nrf2
  antioxidant signaling by cisplatin in mouse testes. (A) Melatonin level in mouse
  serum. (B) Melatonin level in mouse testes. (C) Determination of the ASMT and AANAT
  protein levels was performed by Western blotting in mouse testes. The blots were
  quantified using Image J software. (D) MT1 immunofluorescence in mouse testicular
  tissue. 3β-HSD was tagged with green fluorescence, while MT1 was tagged with red
  fluorescence. The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale bar = 20 μm). (E) MT2 immunofluorescence
  in mouse testicular tissue. 3β-HSD was tagged with red fluorescence, while MT2 was
  tagged with green fluorescence. The nucleus was labeled with DAPI (scale bar = 20
  μm). (F) Determination of the MT1 and MT2 protein levels was performed by Western
  blotting in mouse testes. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (G)
  Determination of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels was performed by Western blotting
  in mouse testes. The blots were quantified using Image J software. (H) Determination
  of SIRT1, SOD1, and SOD2 protein levels was performed by Western blotting in mouse
  testes. The blots were quantified using Image J software. CP, cisplatin. CP + Mel,
  cisplatin + melatonin. Mel, melatonin. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (N =
  8 per group). * p < 0.05 compared with controls or CP groups. ** p < 0.01 compared
  with controls or CP groups.
