caption: IGFBP5 modulated EMT progress and Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. (A)The relative
  protein levels of E-cadherin,Vimentin and MMP-2 in IGFBP5 knockdown cells compared
  to corresponding control cells were detected by Western blot. (B) The relative protein
  levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin and MMP-2 in IGFBP5 over-expression cells
  compared to corresponding control cells were detected by Western blot. GAPDH was
  used as a loading control. (C, D) Effect of IGFBP5 expression on the expression
  of proteins related to the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.
