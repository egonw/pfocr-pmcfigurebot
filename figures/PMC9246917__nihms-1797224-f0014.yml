figure_title: NCOR2 associates with the promoters of the genes in the STAT-1/IRF1
  death signaling pathway
caption: a, Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-re-ChIP assays
  showing that NCOR2 and HDAC3 are concomitantly recruited to the IRF1 binding site
  (IRF-E) at the TNFSF10, CASP1, CASP7 or STAT1 promoters in TRAIL (1 μg/mL × 3 hr)-treated
  HMT-3522 T4–2 cells overexpressing (OE) NCOR2 or an empty vector (Vector). Re-ChIP
  was then carried out using the precipitates from the first round of ChIP for the
  indicated genes using anti-HDAC3 antibody (representative data of n=2 independent
  experiments with similar results). b, ChIP assay data showing association of NCOR2
  together with STAT-1 at the IRF1 promoter in TRAIL-treated HMT-3522 T4–2 cells with
  the OE of NCOR2 or an empty vector (Vector) using anti-NCOR2, STAT-1, acetylated
  histone H3 (Ac-H3), transcription factor IIB (TF IIB), RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
  antibodies or an isotype control IgG (representative data of n=2 independent experiments
  with similar results). c, ChIP assay data showing molecular associations of NCOR2
  at the promoters of TNFSF10, CASP1, CASP7 or STAT1 in TRAIL-treated HMT-3522 T4–2
  cells with the OE of NCOR2 or an empty vector (Vector) using anti-NCOR2, HDAC3,
  Ac-H3, TF IIB, Pol II antibodies or an isotype control IgG (representative data
  of n=2 independent experiments with similar results). d, Results of ChIP from HMT-3522
  T4–2 cells with lentiviral-shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of NCOR2 expression showing
  attenuation of the association of HDAC3 with the IRF-E on the promoter of TNFSF10,
  CASP1, CASP7 or STAT1 following TRAIL treatment. Findings also showed that loss
  of NCOR2 simultaneously permitted histone hyperacetylation and enhanced the recruitment
  of the TF IIB and Pol II (representative data of n=2 independent experiments with
  similar results).
