caption: (A) Representative confocal images of RelA/p65 (red) merged with Hoechst
  (blue) in HUVECs under indicated treatments (20× magnification); (B) The relative
  nuclear/cytosolic RelA/p65 signal was measured in confocal images of four independent
  experiments and means and standard deviations are represented; (C) Representative
  Western blot images of RelA/p65, structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3, nuclear
  protein control) and α-tubulin (cytosolic protein control) levels in nuclear fractions
  of HUVECs under indicated treatments; (D) Densitometric quantification of (C) and
  three additional independent experiments, RelA/p65 bands were relativized to SMC3
  bands and normalized to the negative control (unstimulated cells) and means and
  standard deviations of four independent replicates are represented; statistical
  analyses were performed through t-tests; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001.
