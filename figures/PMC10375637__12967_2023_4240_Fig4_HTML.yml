caption: Hsa_circ_0002348 inhibited trophoblast proliferation and induced apoptosis
  through the repression of mTOR/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. A Representative images
  of TUNEL staining in the pregnant mice’s placentas of each group (n = 3/per group
  for each experiment); TUNEL signals in red, and DAPI-stained nuclei in blue; Scar
  bars, 50 μm; B qRT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of hsa_circ_0002348 in
  HTR8 cells following its knockdown by two distinct siRNAs; C qRT-PCR analysis of
  the expression levels of hsa_circ_0002348 in HTR8 cells with its overexpression
  vector; CCK-8 assay showing the proliferation ability of HTR8 cells after transfected
  with two siRNAs D and its overexpression vector E; colony-formation assays showing
  the proliferation capacity of HTR8 cells with two siRNAs F and hsa_circ_0002348
  overexpression vector G; flow cytometry of fluorescence analysis stained with Annexin
  V-FITC and PI in HTR8 cells after hsa_circ_0002348 knockdown by two distinct siRNAs
  H and its overexpression vector I; the percentage of cells in the four different
  quadrants calculated, the results presented in different histograms indicating the
  fraction of the apoptotic cells as Annexin V+/PI− and Annexin V+/PI+; the quantitative
  results of F–I displayed in the right; J western blotting analysis detecting the
  expression level of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38, p38, p-JNK and JNK when
  compared with Tubulin as control in HTR8 cells with NC or with two hsa_circ_0002348
  siRNAs as treatment; the quantitative analysis of band intensity performed with
  Image J (right); circ_0002348 representing hsa_circ_0002348; NC negative control,
  Ctrl control; the data presented as mean ± SEM; *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001,****p ≤ 0.0001
