caption: Cell proliferation assay analyzed by CCK8. (a) MC38 cells were treated with
  anlo (2.5 μM/mL, 5 μM/mL, and 20 μM/mL) for 6 to 72 h. (b) CT26 cells were treated
  with anlo (2.5 μM/mL, 5 μM/mL, and 20 μM/mL) for 6 to 72 h. (c) Representative images
  of immunofluorescence were observed by fluorescence microscopy, which confirmed
  the expression of KI67, and quantification of the results. (d) MC38 cells were assigned
  for four groups, which were PBS, anlo (2.5 μM/mL), αPDL1 (10 μg/mL), and combination
  group (anlo and αPDL1) for 6 to 72 h. (e) CT26 cells were assigned for four groups,
  which were PBS, anlo (2.5 μM/mL), αPDL1 (10 μg/mL), and combination group (anlo
  and αPDL1) for 6 to 72 h.
