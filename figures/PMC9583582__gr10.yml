caption: Results of transcriptome sequencing. (A) The number of upregulated (red)
  and downregulated genes (blue). (B) Volcano plot of RNA-seq data of BMMs in SBP@TCP
  and TCP. (C) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for BMMs in SBP@TCP
  and TCP. (D) GOBubble plot of GO enrichment analysis in DEGs. (E) GOCircle plot
  of GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs. (F) GOBubble plot of KEGG enrichment analysis
  in DEGs. (G) GOchord of KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs, including “Osteoclast
  differentiation”, “Rheumatoid arthritis”, “Hematopoietic cell lineage”, “NF-kappa
  B signaling pathway”, and “Oxidative phosphorylation”. (H) Heatmap of DEGs for BMMs
  in GOchord of KEGG enrichment analysis.
