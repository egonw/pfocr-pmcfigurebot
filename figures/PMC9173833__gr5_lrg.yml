caption: 'The association of higher IRF1 gene expression with the prevalence and severity
  of COVID-19 and the potential therapeutic strategies. A: rs17622656 eQTL analysis
  on IRF1 gene expression in human spleen of GTEx datasets. B: rs17622656 allele frequency
  of global populations in 1000 genome project. C and D: Relative gene expression
  of IRF1 (C) and insulin/IGF signaling pathway molecules (D) in whole blood samples
  from hospitalized noncritical and critical COVID-19 patients (GSE172114, noncritical
  n = 23, critical n = 46). E: Heatmap image of human epithelial LNCaP cells treated
  with or without DHT (GSE114052). F: Heatmap image of cultured human subcutaneous
  adipose tissues treated with the indicated dexamethasone (DEX) concentrations (GSE88966).
  G: Heatmap image of cultured human primary islets treated with the indicated dexamethasone
  (DEX) concentrations (GSE167250). H: Heatmap image of lung tissue in humanized mouse
  infected with SARS-CoV-2 with/without dexamethasone (DEX) intervention (GSE200561;
  Control: non-infected; SARS-CoV-2 infection: CoV2: SARS-CoV-2 infection + Dexamethasone:
  + DEX,). I: Human AR and GR ChIP-Seq peaks in the promoter regions of the IRF1 gene
  (AR: GSM3577148, GR: GSM3579033). J and K: Western blot image of IRS2, phospho-Akt,
  and total Akt in HEK293T cells treated with TNF-α (2 ng/ml) with/without DHT (100 nM;
  J) or DEX (100 nM; K) for 24 h followed by insulin response (100 nM) at the indicated
  time points. Data represent the mean ± SEM. #p < 0.25, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.'
