figure_title: E2F1-activated PRSS22 transcription in BC cells
caption: A Schematic diagram of luciferase vectors pGL3-2,000(P1), pGL3-1,012(P2),
  pGL3-912(P3), pGL3-562(P4) and pGL3-234(P5). B, C Transcriptional activity analysis
  of the PRSS22 promoter fragments in BC cells revealed that the upstream 234 bp(P5)
  is core promoter region for PRSS22 transcription. D, E Luciferase activity assay
  demonstrated that E2F1 and ETS1 increased promoter activities of P5 in BC cells.
  F–I The influence of E2F1 on PRSS22 were measured by RT-qPCR (F, G) and Western
  blot (H, I). J Two primers that covered the E2F1 binding sites at the regions −127
  to −138 bp, −68 to −79 bp were designed (up). Schematic diagram of the luciferase
  reporter construct containing the human PRSS22 promoter and the mutant construct
  (P5 Mut1, P5 Mut2) containing the basal promoter in which the presumed binding sites
  were mutated (bottom). K The relative luciferase activity of the PRSS22 promoter
  was decreased when the predicted E2F1-binding site (P (−127 to −138) Luc-E2F1-1)
  was mutated (P5 Mut1). L–N ChIP-qPCR results indicated that the promoter amplicons
  in the E2F1-binding site precipitated by anti-E2F1 antibody were more enriched than
  those precipitated by anti-IgG antibody. Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant.
