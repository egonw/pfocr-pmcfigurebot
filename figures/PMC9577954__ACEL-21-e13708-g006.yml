caption: Sound‐evoked activity along the cochlear axis, and in higher auditory centers
  in the aging brain, is higher in aging Ntf3 overexpressing mice than in age‐matched
  controls. (a) After tamoxifen treatment at 60 weeks of age, ABR peak 1 amplitudes
  along the cochlear axis are larger in Ntf3 stop :Slc1a3/CreER T  mice than in Ntf3
  stop  age‐matched controls. 2‐way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons
  test was used to evaluate ABR peak 1 amplitudes between groups over time at each
  individual cochlear region (frequency, kHz). (b) Mean ABR waveforms recorded at
  59 (baseline), 64 and 95 weeks of age show that mice with Ntf3 overexpression have
  larger sound‐induced ABR peaks along the ascending auditory pathway as they age.
  At baseline, before tamoxifen treatment, no intergroup differences were seen in
  ABR waveforms (also see Figure ). At 64 weeks, peak 1 amplitudes were increased
  in Ntf3 overexpressing mice. At 95 weeks, Ntf3 overexpressors exhibited smaller
  decreases in ABR peaks 1, 2, and 4 than Ntf3 stop  controls (also see Figure ).
  ABRs shown here are group means in response to 16 kHz tone pips at 80 dB SPL. Ntf3
  stop n = 7–13 mice; Ntf3 stop :Slc1a3/CreER T n = 7–17 mice. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001.
