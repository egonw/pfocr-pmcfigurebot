caption: Integrated analysis between microbiome and metabolites. (A) The Spearman
  correlation analysis between significantly changed microbiome and metabolites. +
  and â€“ indicate the significantly positive and negative association, respectively.
  (B) A Venn diagram of significant differential KEGG pathways in functional analysis
  of gut microbiota and the metabolic pathway based on the metabolites. (C) Interaction
  network plots of enriched metabolites in the shared pathways with microbes that
  participate in their metabolism. Red colors indicate significantly upregulated metabolites
  or microbes, while blue colors indicate significantly downregulated metabolites
  or microbes. Red and blue lines indicate the positive and negative correlation,
  respectively.
