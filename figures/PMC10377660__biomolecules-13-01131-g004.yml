caption: Apigetrin caused apoptosis in HepG2 cells. (a) To quantify apigetrin-induced
  apoptosis in HepG2 cells, double staining was performed at indicated concentrations
  (0, 50, and 100 µM) for 48 h. The data are presented as the mean ± standard error
  of mean (SEM) * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001. (b) DAPI staining was performed to observe
  fragmented chromatin under a fluorescence microscope.
