caption: Effects of CHDT on the expression of myogenic transcription factors and muscle
  fiber size in mice with Dex-induced muscle atrophy. The protein expression levels
  of myogenic transcription factors were measured by Western blotting in (A) QUA and
  (B) GAS muscles. (C) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained transverse sections of the QUA
  (top) and GAS (bottom) muscles. (D) Cross sectional area (CSA) of QUA (left) and
  GAS (right) muscles.Different letters indicate statistically significant differences;
  p < 0.05, a > b > c > d.
