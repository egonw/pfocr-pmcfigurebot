caption: Relative expression of methionine metabolism, mTOR signaling pathway, anti-oxidative
  and immune system related genes in hepatopancreas of L. vannamei fed with four diets.
  All gene expression of the NC group was standardized as about 1. All expression
  values are normalized with Î²-actin (n=3), with SD denoted by vertical bars. Different
  letters over columns indicate significantly different (p < 0.05).
article_title: Comparative study on the effects of crystalline L-methionine and methionine
  hydroxy analogue calcium supplementations in the diet of juvenile Pacific white
  shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).
