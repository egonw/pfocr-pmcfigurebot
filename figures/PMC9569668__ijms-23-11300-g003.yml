caption: AEG-1 and miR-221 regulate angiogenesis and cell cycle regulatory mRNA expressions
  in the HCC cell lines. The regulatory mRNAs expressions which regulate angiogenesis
  (LSF and MMP9) and cell cycle (p57, p53, and RB) were analyzed in miR-221 mimic-,
  miR-221 inhibitor-, AEG-1 siRNA-, and their corresponding control-transfected HepG2,
  Huh7, and Hep3B cells by using qRT- PCR. The GAPDH was used as an internal control.
  Error bars presented as mean Â± s.d and p-values represented as * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. ns represented as non-significance.
