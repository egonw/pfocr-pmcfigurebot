caption: 'Blocking MARCH1 in DCs prevents the Rs-compromised SIT effects on lung inflammation.
  WT mice and MARCH1∆DC mice were treated with the OVA/Alum protocol to develop an
  AAD mouse model. Mice were treated with procedures denoted above each image. Histology
  images of the lung show the results of H&E staining and PAS staining (original magnification:
  ×100). The images are from one mouse/group that represent 6 mice per group. Abbreviations:
  DC: Dendritic cell. Rs: Restraint stress. SIT: Specific allergen immunotherapy.
  OVA: Ovalbumin. AAD: Airway allergic disorder. H&E: Hematoxylin and eosin staining.
  PAS: Periodic acid-Schiff staining. WT: Wild type mice. KO: MARCH1∆DC mice (mice
  carrying MARCH1-deficient DCs).'
