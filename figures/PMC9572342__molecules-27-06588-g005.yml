caption: The effect of 250 µM naringenin, 4.4 µM BPA, 37% FEN, co-treatment naringenin
  + BPA or co-treatment FEN + BPA, and blank of fermentation (10%) on HT-29 cells
  was evaluated after 24 h incubation by LDH cytotoxicity assay. The total LDH controls
  can also be used to calculate the total effect of a specific condition. The experimental
  data are expressed as the mean value ± SD of the three independent experiments with
  three replicates of each one. Letters indicate statistical difference (p < 0.05).
article_title: Fermentation Extract of Naringenin Increases the Expression of Estrogenic
  Receptor β and Modulates Genes Related to the p53 Signalling Pathway, miR-200c and
  miR-141 in Human Colon Cancer Cells Exposed to BPA.
