caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 attenuated the histopathological phenotypic characteristics
  of mouse tumour cells and promoted their apoptosis (A) H&E staining was performed
  to observe the tumour histopathology of mice in each group. (B) E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin,
  and GPX4 expression were detected by immunofluorescence. (C) Ki‐67 expression was
  detected by immunohistochemistry. Cell apoptosis in each group was detected by the
  TUNEL assay

  cancer cells via the AKT/GSK‐3β pathway and cell iron death.
