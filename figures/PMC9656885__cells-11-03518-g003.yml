caption: Bta-miR-199a-3p inhibits the production of inflammatory factors in the LPS-induced
  MAC-T cells. (A,B) The cells were transfected with the bta-miR-199a-3p mimic or
  inhibitor for 42 h and then induced with 50 ng/μL of LPS for 6 h, and qRT-PCR was
  used to detect the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The GAPDH and
  RPS18 genes were used as the internal controls. (C,D) The protein levels of the
  cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were determined using ELISA. * refers to p < 0.05,
  ** refers to p < 0.01.
