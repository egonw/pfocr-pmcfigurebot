caption: 'The wiring diagram of the regulatory network of the PERK pathway‐controlled
  ER stress response mechanism. The regulatory elements are denoted by isolated colored
  boxes. Dashed line shows how the components can influence each other, while blocked
  end lines denote inhibition. Previously established relationships are illustrated
  by black lines, while newly hypothesized (this study) relationships are shown with
  blue lines. Based on our molecular biological experiments and mathematical modeling,
  we propose new feedback loops within the PERK pathway: an extra positive feedback
  loop between GADD34 and ATF4, a negative feedback loop between CHOP and ATF4, and
  an indirect positive feedback loop between GADD34 and CHOP.'
