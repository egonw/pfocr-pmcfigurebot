caption: 'Proteomics analysis of serum samples in LC patients: (A) volcano plot of
  differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The threshold set for DEPs was a fold‐changes
  (FC) >1.5 and a p < .05. Five proteins are upregulated (red) and three proteins
  are downregulated (green). (B) Heat map of the nine DEPs between the LC and control
  groups, with folds >±1.5 and p < .05. The columns represent DEPs and the rows indicate
  the samples. The colours from violet to red indicate the increasing content of DEPs.
  (C and D) GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the nine DEPs. Terms
  in the same category were ranked based on the p‐values. (E) protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) networks of the identified DEPs. Red ellipses surrounded dots are associated
  with the regulation of interleukin (IL)‐8 production and peptidase activity, respectively.'

  a novel interplay among commensal bacteria, metabolites and candidate targets in
