caption: 'Treatment with PARPi in combination with ATR/CHK1 pathway inhibitors bypasses
  the cell cycle checkpoint due to an early signal of cell death. (A) Percentage of
  apoptotic and necrotic SKOV-3, PEO-1 and OV-90 cells after 24 and 48 h treatment
  with PARPi (4 µM), ATRi (4 µM) or CHK1i (4 µM) alone or in combination; (B) G2/M
  phase distribution of PEO-1 treated for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD of
  3 independent experiments. * p < 0.05 vs. control cells. * indicates statistically
  significant differences between samples incubated with the compound compared with
  control cells (p < 0.05); + indicates statistically significant differences between
  samples incubated with PARPi alone and the combination treatments (PARPi:ATRi; PARPi:CHK1i)
  (p < 0.05); # denotes statistically significant differences between samples incubated
  with ATRi or CHKi alone and their corresponding combination treatments (PARPi:ATRi;
  PARPi:CHK1i) (p < 0.05); (C) Representative dot plots showing induction of apoptosis
  and necrosis in PEO-1 cells after 48 h treatment with PARPi (4 µM), ATRi (4 µM)
  or CHK1i (4 µM) alone and in combination. Data for SKOV-3 and OV-90 cells are shown
  in . Individual samples are presented as data points. The population of apoptotic
  cells was calculated according to the presented gating strategy; (D) Representative
  dot plots demonstrating the distribution of cell cycle phases in PEO-1 cells after
  24 h treatment alone and in combination. Representative dot plots for SKOV-3 and
  OV-90 cells are shown in . Individual samples are presented as data points. The
  population of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was calculated according to
  the presented gating strategy.'
