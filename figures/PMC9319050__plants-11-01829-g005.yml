caption: Fold-change (FC) of phenolic accumulation in leaves and roots of UV treated
  plants at 11 days of treatment and after 3 days of recovery with respect to control
  plants. Compounds were grouped on the basis of phenolic class (a,b), flavonoid (c,d),
  and phenolic acids (e,f) subclasses. Data for each biochemical pathway represent
  the sum of the Log2FC of each detected compound.
