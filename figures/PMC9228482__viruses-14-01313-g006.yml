caption: β-Hydroxybutyrate and amino acid derivative metabolism. The levels of (A)
  β-hydroxybutyrate, (B) carnitine, (C) α-ketoisovalerate, and (D) hydroxyproline
  in PWH before and after ART compared with HIVSN. Scatter plots show mean and significance
  notations of adjusted p-values at * = p < 0.05, *** = p < 0.001, and **** = p <
  0.0001. For multiple group comparisons, Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were
  performed in combination with Games-Howell multiple comparisons correction for sample
  sizes >50 with a 95% confidence interval. (E) Diagrammatic representation of metabolic
  pathways modified by HIV and ART. In pre-ART HIV, blue indicates CoA conjugate,
  enzyme, and pathway names; black indicates no change; red indicates significantly
  increased levels; and aqua indicates significantly decreased levels, compared with
  HIVSN. Solid line up-arrows (↑) indicate significantly increased and solid line
  down-arrows (↓) indicate significantly decreased levels following ART compared with
  pre-ART HIV.
