figure_title: PKCλ/ι deficiency results in the upregulation of the IFN pathway in
  intestinal epithelial cells
caption: (A) GSEA of transcriptomic data from RNA-seq on Prkcif/f;Villin-Cre versus
  Prkcif/f IECs using compilation C5 and C2 (MSigDB).(B) Scatterplot of mRNA expression
  and PageRank Z score for transcription factor genes upregulated in Prkcif/f;Villin-Cre
  IECS.(C) Schematic representation for tamoxifen treatment in organoids from Prkcif/f;Villin-CreER
  mice. Organoids were stimulated with 500 nM of tamoxifen or vehicle for 3 days.(D)
  qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels of IFN-related genes in tamoxifen-treated organoids
  and non-treated organoids from Prkcif/f;Villin-CreER mice.(E) pSTAT1 staining and
  quantification in small intestines from Prkcif/f;Villin-Cre (n = 4) and Prkcif/f
  (n = 4) mice. Scale bar, 50 μm.(F) Schematic representation for tamoxifen treatment
  in Prkcif/f;Villin-CreER mice. Tamoxifen was injected by oral gavage (240 mg/kg)
  and mice were sacrificed after 7 days treatment.(G and H) pSTAT1 (G) or CD8 (H)
  staining and quantification of small intestines from Prkcif/f;Villin-Cre (n = 3)
  and Prkcif/f (n = 3) mice treated as in (F). Scale bar, 50 μm.(I-M) Prkcif/f (n
  = 3) and Prkcif/f;Villin-CreER (n = 4) mice treated with the azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS
  protocol and tamoxifen treatment. Experimental design (I), macroscopic images (J),
  quantification of the tumor number, tumor size and tumor load (K), pSTAT1 (L), CD8
  (M) staining and quantification of colon tumors from Prkcif/f;Villin-Cre and Prkcif/f
  mice treated as in (I). Scale bars, 1 mm (J), 50 μm L), and (M).(N-Q) Subcutaneous
  injection of sgPrkci (n = 5) and sgC (n = 5) MC38 cells in WT mice. Experimental
  design and immunoblot analysis of indicated proteins in sgPrkci and sgC MC38 cells
  (N), quantification of the tumor volume (O), pSTAT1 (P) and CD8 (Q) staining and
  quantification from tumors originated from sgPrkci and sgC MC38 cells. Scale bar,
  100 μm. (R-U) Subcutaneous injection of sgPrkci (n = 5) and sgC (n = 5) mouse tumor
  organoids (MTOs) in WT mice. Experimental design and immunoblot analysis of indicated
  proteins in sgPrkci and sgC MTOs (R), quantification of the tumor volume (S), pSTAT1
  (T) and CD8 (U) staining and quantification from tumors originated from sgPrkci
  and sgC MTOs. Scale bar, 50 μm.Results are shown as mean ± SEM *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. See also .
