caption: Activation of ROS sensors and metabolic modulators. NRF2-Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (KEAP1) system represents the paradigmatic reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  sensor apparatus. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is degraded by the KEAP1–Cullin
  3 (CUL3) E3 ligase complex. During oxidative stress, the KEAP1 system is directly
  modified by ROS, which leads to conformational changes in the KEAP1–CUL3 complex,
  thus disabling ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2. During normoxia, the proline
  residues of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases
  (PHDs) in the presence of oxygen (O2), iron (Fe2+) and α-ketoglutarate. Under hydroxylation,
  HIFα is polyubiquitylated by the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL)
  complex and guided for proteasomal degradation. Homodimers of IKKγ can be formed
  through ROS-induced disulfide bonds, thus potentiating its downstream effect on
  NF-κB. The PI3K-AKT pathway can be stimulated by ROS through phosphorylation and
  inhibition of tensin homolog (PTEN). In addition, AKT also controls the activity
  of NRF2, HIFα, NF-κB, and FOXO. The FOXO family are activated by ROS signaling but
  inhibited by the canonical insulin receptor through PI3K/AKT in the presence of
  growth factors. Furthermore, ASK1/JNK pathways mediate FOXO activation upon oxidative
  stress, in which ROS-induced homodimers of ASK1 directly lead to the activation
  of JNK, a kinase predominantly facilitating the nuclear translocation and activation
  of FOXO through phosphorylation.
