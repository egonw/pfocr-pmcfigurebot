caption: miRNA in LNCaP exosomes is regulated by substrate stiffness. A. Volcano map
  of differentially expressed miRNA in Stiff-Exo and Soft-Exo. |log2(FC)|≥0.58; p
  Value ≤ 0.05 is defined as difference. B. Schematic diagram of GO enrichment analysis
  (Cellular Component) of differential miRNAs target genes (top 19, sort according
  to p value). C. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs target genes
  in KEGG pathway (top 20, sort according to p value). n = 3.
