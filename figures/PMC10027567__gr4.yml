caption: 'Scheme summarizing the major differences in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to stiffness in the poly-l-lysine/HA films
  []. Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society. s-TGF: soluble TGF-β1; i-TGF: immobilized
  TGF-β1; TβRI: TGF-β receptor type I. (A) In the bare soft matrix or with s-TGF,
  both β1 integrin and TβRI were in a low expression level in HCC cells, resulting
  in a negligible PI3K phosphorylation which confined HCC cells in an inactive phenotype.
  (B) In the bare stiff matrix or with s-TGF, mechanotransduction could be moderately
  enhanced due to the increasing expression of β1 integrin, then the modest activation
  of PI3K induced HCC cells to exhibit an epithelial phenotype. (C) In the soft matrix
  with i-TGF, TβRI expression was stimulated for activation of i-TGF-TβRI-dependent
  PI3K pathway (indicated by “a”). Meanwhile, i-TGF-TβRI interactions promoted HCC
  cell adhesion to enlarge the contact area for stiffness sensing, resulting in the
  mildly raising expression of β1 integrin to activate vinculin/p-FAK-dependent PI3K
  pathway (indicated by “b”). HCC cells also exhibited an epithelial phenotype in
  this condition. (D) In the stiff matrix with i-TGF, it occurred the most significant
  cooperation effect of mechanotransduction and i-TGF signaling, and the strongest
  PI3K activation resulted in the mesenchymal phenotype of HCC cells.'
