caption: A Simplified Schematic of the Canonical Hedgehog Signaling Pathway. (A) Pathway
  Off. In the absence of a Hh ligand, PTCH inhibits SMO. GLI2 and GLI3, bound to SUFU,
  traffic to the primary cilia. PKA, CK1, and GSK3Î² phosphorylate the GLI factors
  for proteolytic cleavage to their repressor forms, which translocate to the nucleus
  to inhibit the transcription of Hh pathway target genes. GLI3R (bold) is the major
  transcriptional suppressor. (B) Pathway On. A Hh ligand binds to PTCH to relieves
  its inhibition of SMO. With SMO activation, SUFU bound to GLI translocates to the
  primary cilium. EVC and EVC2 promote SUFU dissociation from GLI factors. GLI2, the
  primary activating GLI factor, then translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription
  of Hh pathway target genes. GLI3 undergoes proteasomal degradation. Created with
