figure_title: Enhanced engraftment of mouse prostate organoids with reduced Activin
  A signalling into immunocompetent hosts
caption: Schematic view of the orthotopic transplantation strategy into the anterior
  prostate lobe of immunocompetent syngeneic C57BL/6J mice.Frequency of engraftment
  (%) of mouse prostate organoid lines (C57#1 DLP and C57#3 DLP) expanded in complete
  medium (normal C57#1 n = 8 mice, normal C57#3 n = 2 mice) or adapted to the absence
  of A83‐01 (adapted C57#1 n = 8 mice, adapted C57#3 n = 2 mice; Binomial test, two‐tailed).Normalized
  mitotic (Ki67+) cell index in grafts of mouse prostate organoid lines (C57#1 DLP
  and C57#3 DLP) expanded incomplete medium conditions (normal) or adapted to the
  absence of A83‐01 (non‐parametric Mann–Whitney test).Representative H&E, IF, and
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of host prostate tissue and engrafted donor
  organoid cells. Scale bar = 50 μm.Model of the molecular pathway primed by Activin
  A to safeguard quiescence in adult prostate progenitors.
