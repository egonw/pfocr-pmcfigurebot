caption: gmfg acts upstream of Notch during HSPC initiation. a GSEA profiles depicting
  the enriched processes in “hematopoietic cell lineage” and “Notch signaling pathway”.
  b tp1:mCherry;fli1a:eGFP double transgenic embryos injected with control MO, gmfg-atgMO,
  and gmfg-spMO were visualized at 28 hpf. White arrowheads indicate cells in the
  DA with active Notch signaling. c Enumeration of tp1 + fli1a + Notch-active ECs
  from (b). Bars represent mean ± SD of control (n = 14), gmfg-atgMO (n = 16), and
  gmfg-spMO (n = 16) embryos. ****p < 0.0001. d Quantitative RT-PCR results of Notch
  target genes hey1 and hey2 in FACS-sorted HE of control and gmfg-atgMO embryos at
  48 hpf. Bars represent mean ± SD (n = 3). ***p < 0.001. e hsp70l:Gal4;UAS:NICD embryos
  injected with control MO and gmfg-atgMO were heat shocked at 12–14 hpf and WISH
  for runx1 was performed at 28 hpf. Arrowheads denote runx1 + HSPCs along the DA.
  Numbers at the lower right corner of the picture represent embryos with displayed
  phenotype/whole embryos. All scale bars, 100 µm
