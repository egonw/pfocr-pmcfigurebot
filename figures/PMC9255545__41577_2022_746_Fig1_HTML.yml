figure_title: Drug targets in the IL-23–IL-17 pathway
caption: Activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages through pathogen recognition
  receptors (PRRs) promotes production of IL-23 and IL-1β, which play a major role
  in the induction and/or expansion of populations of T helper 17 (TH17) cells, IL-17-secreting
  γδ T (γδT17) cells and other IL-17-secreting cells (not shown). By contrast IL-12
  production by DCs and macrophages promotes development of TH1 cells. Monoclonal
  antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize IL-12p40 (ustekinumab) suppress TH1 cell as well
  as TH17 cell and γδT17 cell responses, whereas mAbs that neutralize IL-23 (guselkumab,
  tildrakizumab and risankizumab) specifically block IL-17-secreting cells. The RORγt
  transcriptional factor is the master regulator of IL-17 production in diverse cell
  types and a target for small molecule drugs (SMDs) in development. TH17 cells, γδT17
  cells and other IL-17-secreting cells (not shown) co-produce IL-17A and IL-17F and,
  while most of the focus has been on mAbs specific for IL-17A (secukinumab and ixekizumab),
  antibodies that neutralize both IL-17A and IL-17F (bimekizumab) are also in clinical
  use. These, together with mAbs that bind to IL-17RA (brodalumab) and inhibit binding
  of IL-17A and IL-17F to IL-17RA–IL-17RC, appear to be marginally more effective
  than anti-IL-17A mAbs. Finally, peptides, macrocycles and other SMDs that target
  IL-17R or ACT1 are also in development. GM-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern.
