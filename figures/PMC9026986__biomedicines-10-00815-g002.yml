caption: Various physiological molecules of the central nervous system (CNS) act through
  the Akt signaling pathway. The pivotal role of the Akt signaling pathway in CNS
  myelination is evident. See text for details and references. Cbl = cobalamin; ECM
  = extracellular matrix; EGF = epidermal growth factor; IGF = insulin-like growth
  factor; mTORC = mammalian target of rapamycin complex; NRG = neuregulin; ODC = oligodendrocyte;
  PrPC = normal cellular prion protein.
