caption: Morphological and nuclear changes upon apigetrin treatment. (a) Changes in
  the morphology of Hep3B cells after 48 h of apigetrin treatment under a light microscope,
  showing cell death after treatment with apigetrin at 50, and 100 µM. (b) After treatment
  with apigetrin (0, 50, and 100 µM) for 48 h, DAPI staining was performed followed
  by observation under a fluorescence microscope. (c) Hematoxylin staining was performed
  for cells after treatment with apigetrin at different concentrations (0, 50, and
  100 µM) for 48 h. Hep3B cells showed necroptotic morphology such as cell swelling
  and formation of vacuoles.
