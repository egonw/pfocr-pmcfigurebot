caption: Inhibition of APLN increased cell apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells. TE-1
  and ECA-109 cells were transfected with APLN siRNA to knockdown APLN, and stained
  with FITC-Annexin V. Then cells were collected by flow cytometry. Representative
  images of flow cytometry (A) and quantitative (B) were shown; *p<0.05, compared
  to scramble.
article_title: Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and
  promotes cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells in vitro, through activating
  PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
