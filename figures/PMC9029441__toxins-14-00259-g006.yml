caption: 'The effects of 4-PBA on ER stress-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis-induced
  by CTN in mice liver. After the liver tissue was homogenized, the supernatant was
  taken to detect the change of calcium ion content (A). The protein expressions of
  GRP78 (B), CHOP (C), caspase-12 (D), and caspase-3 (E) in liver tissue were detected
  by Western blot and analyzed using image-J soft. The above data are expressed as
  mean Â± SEM. Compared with the control group, ** p < 0.01. Compared with the Citrinin
  (5 mg/kg) group, ## p < 0.01.'
