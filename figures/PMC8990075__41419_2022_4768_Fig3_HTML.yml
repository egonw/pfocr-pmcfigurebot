caption: 'A Deficiency in CAD, STING and Bax and Bak reduce migration. Hela, MDA-MB-231
  and MEF cells (control cells carrying a non-coding gRNA or cells deficient in CAD,
  STING and Bax and Bak) were subjected to scratch assay, and wound closure was recorded.
  Data shown are mean/SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001. B Hela, MDA-MB-231, 1205Lu and SV40-transformed MEF cells (control
  cells carrying a non-coding gRNA or cells deficient in CAD, STING and Bax and Bak;
  MEFs from wt or CAD-deficient mice) were tested for invasion through an ECM basement
  membrane in cell culture. The number of cells that had migrated after 24 h is shown.
  Ten high power fields were counted in each experiment, represented by individual
  symbols. Data shown are means/SD of three independent experiments. ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001. C Hela cells (treated with 10 µM zVAD for 24 h) were tested for
  invasion through an ECM basement membrane in cell culture. The number of cells that
  had migrated after 24 h is shown. Ten high power fields were counted in each experiment,
  represented by individual symbols. Data shown are means/SD of three independent
  experiments. **p < 0.01. D Hela cells (control cells carrying a non-coding gRNA
  or cells deficient in Apaf-1 or cells overexpressing Bcl-XL) were tested for invasion
  through a Matrigel basement matrix. The percentage of cells that had migrated after
  24 h is shown. Data shown are means/SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05.
  E Anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and 1205Lu melanoma cells
  (control cells carrying a non-coding gRNA or cells deficient in CAD or STING) was
  measured as the number of colonies formed in soft-agar. Colonies were stained and
  counted after 21 days. Data shown are means/SD of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05. F cGAS localization to micronuclei. Hela and MDA-MB-231 cells were fixed
  and stained for cGAS (green). DAPI (blue) and α-tubulin (red) were used for the
  staining of nucleus/micronucleus and cytoskeleton respectively. Arrows show micronuclei.
  Images are representative of at least 10 pictures per cell lines. Scale bar: 5 µM.'
