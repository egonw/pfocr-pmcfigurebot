caption: Drug–active monomer–target pathway network. (a–d) The four active components
  of PL were 3′-methoxydaidzein, beta-sitosterol, daidzein-4,7-diglucoside, and formononetin.
  (e) Venn diagram of differential genes and drug targets. (f) Drug–active monomer–target
  pathway network diagram. The yellow–brown prism is the PL, the rectangle represents
  the four active components, the green ellipse is the intersection target gene, and
  the red triangle is the KEGG pathway.
