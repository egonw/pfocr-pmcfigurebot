caption: An overview of the RLR and TLR receptor signaling pathway in lumpfish. (A)
  The molecules in the RIG-1 related signaling pathway identified in lumpfish are
  shown with sky blue boxes, those that are not yet identified are shown in white.
  The figure is modified from KEGG map04622 Differential gene expression analyses
  of members of the RLR (B) and TLR (C) pathways at 6 hours, 24 hours post exposure
  (hpe) and TI group are showed above. Only those that are statistically significant
  regulated (p-value<0.05) are shown.
