figure_title: Up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells
  altered metabolomics profiling based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
  (a) Venn diagram showing that 28 metabolites were detected in both UPF1-knockdown
  groups. (b) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  differentially accumulated metabolites. The y-axis indicates the pathways, and the
  x-axis indicates the enrichment ratio in each pathway. The color bar indicates the
  corrected P value, with yellow representing a higher value and red representing
  a lower value. (c) Heatmap of the changes in metabolites related to UPF1 knockdown.
  Blue represents the decreasing trend, and red represents the increasing trend. From
  the regulatory trends in the heatmap, we observed that amino acids were the main
  downregulated components
