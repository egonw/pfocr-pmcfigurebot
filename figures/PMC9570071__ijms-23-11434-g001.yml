caption: Cd2+ exposure inhibited zebrafish Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A,B)
  Western blot analysis and quantitation of β-catenin expression levels in 6 dpf zebrafish
  larvae exposed to different levels of Cd2+. (C–E) qRT-PCR analysis of relative expression
  of genes involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The values are presented as
  the mean ± SEM. The results of either nonparametric test or ANOVA followed by multiple
  comparison test are listed in . “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
