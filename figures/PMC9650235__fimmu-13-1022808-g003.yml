caption: IL-7/IL-7R signaling pathway. When IL-7 interacts with the IL-7R, the α chain
  and γ chain dimerize. JAK1 and JAK3 were recruited to IL-7Rα and γ chains, separately.
  After phosphorylation, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate and activate the transcription
  factor STAT5, which further upregulates anti-apoptotic family genes expression and
  downregulates pro-apoptotic family genes expression via the JAK-STAT5 pathway. After
  the interaction of IL-7 and IL-7R, recruited p85 induces the phosphorylation of
  the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-7Rα chain, which further triggers the phosphorylation
  of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Activated PI3K-AKT signaling induces glucose metabolism
  regulator genes expression and impedes the expression of cell cycle suppressor p27kip1
  via FOXO1. This figure is created with BioRender.com and smart.servier.com.
