caption: Effects of apigetrin on inflammatory markers in Hep3B cells. Proteins were
  isolated from cells, and expression levels of inflammatory marker proteins TNFα,
  p-p65, and p-IκB were analyzed by western blot. Expression levels are presented
  as a mean ± standard deviation (SD) graphically based on their densitometry values
  from with three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 vs. control, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  control, *** p < 0.001 vs. control.
