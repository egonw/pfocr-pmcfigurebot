caption: KEGG pathway enrichment and correlation analysis of the differentially expressed
  metabolites. Differentially expressed metabolites between PmACRE1 transgenic A.
  thaliana and the vector control group were annotated by KEGG, and enrichment analysis
  of the relevant pathways was performed. Each bubble represents a metabolic pathway,
  and the pathways highlighted by enrichment analysis and topological analysis are
  labelled A. In the correlation analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites,
  red and blue connecting lines represent the positive and negative correlations between
  two compounds, respectively B
