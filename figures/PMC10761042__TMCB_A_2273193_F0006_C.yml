caption: 'PTP1B reduced activity negatively affects Cdk3/Rb/E2F signaling in human
  GB cells. (A) The activities of Cdk3 and Rb in GB cells treated with vehicle, claramine
  2 µM or trodusquemine 2 µM were assessed by immunoblot using total and phospho-specific
  antibodies. (B) The activities of Cdk3 and Rb in GB cells transfected with siRNAs
  targeting PTP1B were assessed by immunoblot using total and phospho-specific antibodies.
  (C) The expression levels of the E2F target genes: Cdk1, Cyclin A, and Cyclin E1
  were assessed by RT-qPCR. All data were normalized to control GAPDH. Fold changes
  were calculated using the ΔCt method (2-ΔΔCt). Data are representative of three
  independent experiments.'
