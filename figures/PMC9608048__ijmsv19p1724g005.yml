caption: The JNK signaling pathway effect on Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) treatment.
  Lysates from MG63 cells were either treated with OCP (10 mg/ml or 20 mg/ml) or without
  OCP treatment. PD98509 (25 µM) used for JNK inhibitor. The bottom graph shows results
  normalized to the control. Data are means ± s.e.m. *p <0.05, unpaired two-tailed
  t-test.
