caption: 'Intracellular accumulation of 7dSh (1). Shown is the mean concentration
  of 7dSh (1) in 20 d old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (dry weight) that were treated
  or not with 100 μM 7dSh (1) and afterwards, extensively washed (n=3; p<0.05). Significance
  between samples was calculated with a Wilcox‐Test (non‐parametric). Error bars:
  SD.'
