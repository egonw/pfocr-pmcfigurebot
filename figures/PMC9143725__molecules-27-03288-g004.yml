caption: 'Effects of Dyglomera® on expression of adipogenesis and lipogenesis related
  proteins in epididymal WATs. ## p < 0.01 between normal diet (ND) group and high
  fat diet (HFD) group. ** p < 0.01 between HFD group and Dyglomera® treated group.
  Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.'
