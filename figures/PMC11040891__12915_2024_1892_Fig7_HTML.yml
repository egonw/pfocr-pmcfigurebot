caption: Long-term hypoxia exposure modulates cell proliferation pathways in seal
  cells. A Overlap between genes DE at all late time points (2 h, 4 h, 6 h) versus
  control for seal and human cells. Heatmap shows log10(fold change) for 41 DE genes
  shared between species. B Reactome pathway enrichments for genes DE at 6 h versus
  control
