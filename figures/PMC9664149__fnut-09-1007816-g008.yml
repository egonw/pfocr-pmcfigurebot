caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pulmonary infection,
  oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses. (1) After entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the
  alveolus, viruses invade type II alveolar cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme
  2 receptors (ACE2) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [see (4)], and infected cells increase
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduce Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response
  element (ARE) redox regulator pathway and become defective for surfactant production.
  Infected cells activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB and release cytokines like interleukin
  (IL)-8. Alveolar type I cells augment ROS production via toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  1 and 2. SARS-CoV-2 enhances neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release and increases
  ROS production (2) SARS-CoV-2 augments macrophage’s ROS production, inhibiting Nrf2
  activation and enhancing NF-κB upregulation. ROS are counterbalanced by enzymes
  like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (Cat), glutathione S-transferase (GST),
  and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) to protect cells from oxidative damage caused by
  nicotinamide adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2), superoxide
  (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Capillary neutrophils
  migrate to and from alveoli by trans-endothelial (TEM) and reverse transmigration
  (rTEM), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause excessive ROS production in
  capillaries, red blood cell (RBC) dysfunction, thrombosis and alveolar damage. (3)
  Activated alveolar macrophages release increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages (via ACE2 and TLRs)
  reduce enzymes like SOD and Cat, among others, and activate NF-κB. NOX2 activation
  increases ROS production that enhance NF-κB activation. Glutathione (GSH) precursors
  (Cystine, cysteine, N-acetyl cysteine, NAC), and selenium (Se) restore GSH and GPx,
  respectively, to counteract the effects of ROS. (4) Alveolar macrophages engulf
  SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells via Fc (γ/α/μ) and scavenger receptors and/or
  pattern recognition protein receptors (PRPRs) leading to increased ROS production
  and cytokine release. (5) Neutrophils contribute to O2– production, lipid peroxidation
  and increased oxidative stress to promote the cytokine storm. Abbreviations: TMPRSS2,
  Transmembrane protease Serine 2; PRPs, pattern recognition proteins. Reprinted from
