caption: 'Integrated single-cell landscape of PBMC in HIV-1, COVID-19, and healthy
  controls. (A) UMAP embeddings of integrated HIV-1+ and COVID-19 patients together
  with healthy controls colored by major cell populations. (B) Top: UMAP split across
  disease conditions after regressing out patient-specific effects using the Harmony
  algorithm. Bottom: UMAP highlighting distribution of major cell populations. (C)
  Stacked bar plots of the relative frequency of major cell populations present in
  each patient. CP: COVID-19 patient. HP: HIV-1+ patient. HD: Healthy donor.(D) Box
  plots of the proportions of each PBMC subset across each disease condition. Proportions
  are computed for each patient by dividing their number of cells in each subset by
  their total number of PBMCs. p-values are computed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test
  with Holm-Bonferroni adjustment.(E) Double differential gene expression plot of
  genes that are differentially expressed between COVID-19 patients compared to healthy
  controls (Y-axis) or differentially expressed between HIV-1+ patients compared to
  healthy controls (X-axis). Log2FC: Log-2-fold change. (F) Dot plot of enriched biological
  pathways from significantly differentially expressed genes (p < .05) that were found
  to be upregulated (right, positive) or downregulated (left, negative) compared to
  healthy controls. Size of dot corresponds to adjusted p-value of enriched pathway.
  NES: Normalized enrichment score.'
