caption: 'Androgen receptor signaling pathway. Baseline tumor biopsies were assessed
  for gene differential gene expression of a defined AR signature. (A): Heatmap of
  gene expression of AR signature. Row orders are based on hierarchical clustering.
  Column orders are based on the specific response groups. (B): AR signature scores
  between responder and nonresponder groups. Statistics assessed by two‐tailed Mann‐Whitney
  test. Nonresponders (PD + SD) in red, responders (CR + PR) in blue.Abbreviations:
  AR, androgen receptor; CR, complete response; LN, lymph node; NR, nonresponders;
  PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; R, responders; SD, stable disease.'
