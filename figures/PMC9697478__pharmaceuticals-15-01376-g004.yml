caption: Effect of BRHE on ROS production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Cells were treated
  with 200, 100, 50 and 25 μg/mL BRHE or treated with 0.5 μg/mL of LPS for 20 h. (A)
  Representative flow cytometry histogram overlay plots of DCF in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
  (B) Statistical analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity of DCF. Fluorescence
  microscopic images of cells stained for ROS. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of
  three replicates (n = 3). ** p < 0.01, compared to the control group.
