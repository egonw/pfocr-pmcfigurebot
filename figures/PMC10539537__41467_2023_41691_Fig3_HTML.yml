figure_title: Hematopoietic-extrinsic IL-1 signaling is critical for activation of
  platelet-biased HSCs in response to acute platelet depletion
caption: (Related to Supplementary Fig. ). a Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
  global gene expression data from CBM-PV cells for the indicated gene sets. NES,
  normalized enrichment score (or scaled score). b Expression of IL-1 signaling pathway
  affiliated genes in CBM-PV cells 1 day post-platelet depletion. Data represent mean ± SD
  FPKM of 3 biological replicates from 2 independent experiments. **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05
  (two-sided t-test). c Mean ± SD levels of IL-1α and IL-1β in bone marrow extracellular
  fluid isolated from mice at the indicated time points post platelet depletion (GPIbα
  antibody treatment). Control mice (Day 0) received isotype (IgG) control antibody.
  Data are from 3 (Day0), 4 (Day1), 4 (Day2), 3 (Day3), 3 (Day5) and 3 (Day10) mice
  from 4 independent experiments. *p < 0.05 (1-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons).
  d Cell cycle analysis of Vwf+ (left) and Vwf– (right) HSCs from mice 1 day post
  intravenous administration of the indicated amounts of IL-1β. Data are mean ± SD
  of 3 mice receiving 0 or 25 μg/Kg, and 4 mice receiving 50 μg/Kg IL-1β, in 2 independent
  experiments. Cell cycle analysis of Vwf+ (left) and Vwf– (right) HSCs from Wt and
  Il1r1–/– mice 1 day (e) or for HSCs from Il1r1–/– mice at the indicated time points
  (f) post platelet depletion. e Mean ± SD data from 3 (IgG-Wt), 6 (IgG-Il1r1–/–)
  7 (GPIbα -Wt) and 7 (GPIbα -Il1r1–/–) mice from 5 independent experiments. f Mean ± SD
  frequencies from 6 (Day0), 7 (Day1), 3 (Day3), 3 (Day5) and 3 (Day10) mice in 4
  independent experiments. *p < 0.05 (in comparison to same analysis of Wt Vwf+ and
  Vwf– HSCs in Fig. ). g, h Il1r1/IL-1R expression analysis (h) at RNA level by RNA-sequencing
  (FPKM) in Vwf+ and Vwf– HSCs and (i) at protein level by flow cytometry in HSPCs
  subsets, isolated from mice in homeostasis or 1 day post platelet depletion. h Mean ± SD
  FPKM data of 3 biological replicates per condition. i Mean ± SD data of Mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) normalized to the MFI of the equivalent cell population in Il1r1–/–
  mice analyzed within the same experiment. Data are from 5 mice per condition, in
  2 independent experiments. i Cell cycle analysis of Vwf-tdTomato+ HSCs from mice
  with conditional deletion of Il1r1 in all hematopoietic cells (Il1r1FL/FLVav-CreTg/+)
  1 day post platelet depletion. Controls include Vwf-tdTomato+ HSCs from Il1r1FL/+Vav-CreTg/+,
  Il1r1+/+Vav-CreTg/+ and Vav-Cre+/+ mice (representing genotypes without an IL-1R
  loss of function). Data represent mean ± SD frequencies of 5 (control-IgG), 5 (control-GPIbα)
  and 4 (Il1r1FL/FLVav-CreTg/+-GPIbα) mice from 3 independent experiments. ***p < 0.001;
  **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; ns non-significant (p > 0.05); using two-sided t-test (b,
  g, h) or 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons (d–f, i). See also Supplementary
