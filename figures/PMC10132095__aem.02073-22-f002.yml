caption: Normalized gene counts of N2 fixation-associated genes in the MECs operating
  at EAN of −0.15 V compared to an EAN of +0.15 V as a reference. No NH4+ was added
  for both conditions. Red font shows genes that were considered upregulated at an
  EAN of −0.15 V (i.e., log2FC > 2.00 and P < 0.05). Adjacent genes are grouped based
  on their location within the genome of G. sulfurreducens and are separated by dashed
  lines. Genes from glnA to gdhA are included because they are involved in NH4+ assimilation
  after N2 fixation. Gene counts are expressed in reads per kilobase per million (RPKM).
  Error bars show the standard deviations for triplicates.
