caption: 'GCLC increased cell motility and radioresistance in HNC cells. (A) Transfection
  of GCLC-shRNA suppressed cell invasion OECM-1 and Detroit 562 cells, as determined
  by Matrigel invasion assay, scale bar 40 Î¼m. (B) Transfection of GCLC -shRNA increased
  radiosensitivity in OECM-1 and Detroit 562 cells, as determined by clonogenic survival
  assay. All the experiments were performed at least three times independently, and
  a typical result was shown. The error bars shown in the relevant figures indicated
  the standard deviation of the quantification results in all experiments. (**: p
  < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, t-test).'
