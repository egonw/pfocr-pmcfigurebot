caption: Analysis of RECK gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR after miR-21
  silencing. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of RECK gene expression in CaSki
  (panel A) and SiHa cells (panel B) transfected with pSIMIR21-5P plasmid. Total RNA
  and cDNA synthesis were obtained from 1 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate
  containing DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2 after 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h (T0, T6, T12,
  and T24, respectively) transfection with increased concentrations of pSIMIR21-5P
  plasmid (0 μg, 3 μg, and 5 μg). Relative expression by real-time RT-qPCR analysis
  of RECK was calculated using the 2−∆∆Ct method and was analyzed by mRNA RECK/mRNA
  GAPDH ratio relative expression units. The Ct values were normalized with pSilencer
  1.0-U6 empty vector plasmid transfection and are presented as mean ± SD. p values
  < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.
