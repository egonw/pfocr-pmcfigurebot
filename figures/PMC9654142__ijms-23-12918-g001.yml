caption: Signaling pathway for the expression of abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes.
  (A) Repression of ABA-responsive genes. In the absence of ABA, clade A protein phosphatases
  (PP2Cs) physically interact with sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase
  2s (SnRK2s) to reduce kinase activity via dephosphorylation. This results in the
  inhibition of ABRE-binding (AREB)/ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) and the suppression
  of ABA-responsive gene transcription. (B) The activation of ABA-responsive gene
  expression. Under drought stress, soluble ABA receptors (Pyrabactin resistance/PYR-related/regulatory
  component of the ABA receptors [PYR/PYL/RCARs]) and PP2Cs act as co-receptors to
  capture ABA, thereby blocking the phosphatase activity of PP2Cs. PP2Cs are released
  from PP2C-SnRK2 complexes, and free SnRK2s phosphorylate downstream transcription
  factors (AREBs/ABFs). The phosphorylated AREBs/ABFs trigger the transcription of
  numerous ABA-responsive genes, leading to ABA responses including stomatal closure.
