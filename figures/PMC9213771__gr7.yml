caption: Proposed pathway for S1P cellular uptake and incorporation into the sphingolipid
  synthesis pathway. Plasma membrane–resident PLPP3 dephosphorylates exogenous S1P
  to sphingosine, which enters cells by a flip-flop mechanism and is phosphorylated
  to S1P by SPHKs 1 and 2. Intracellular S1P serves as a branch-point substrate for
  ER-resident SGPP1 and SGPL1. SGPP1 dephosphorylates S1P to sphingosine, which is
  utilized for ceramide synthesis (CERS2) and sequential modifications for glycosphingolipid
  production. SGPL1 irreversibly degrades S1P to hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine,
  allowing exit of the substrate from the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. These enzymes
  work in concert to drive an S1P dephosphorylation-phosphorylation-dephosphorylation/degradation
  cycle. In the absence of sphingosine kinases, sphingosine may bypass the cycle and
  directly serve as a CERS2 substrate (dashed line), thereby being excluded from the
  SGPL1-mediated degradation pathway. UGCG, B4GALT5, and A4GALT are Golgi core glycosphingolipid
  synthesis enzymes for synthesis of Gb3. LAPTM4A, TM9SF2, SLC35A2, TMEM165, and GOLPH3
  are positive regulators of Gb3 synthesis in the Golgi. AHR is a transcriptional
  activator of genes involved in glycosphingolipid synthesis. Deg, degradation; Dephos,
