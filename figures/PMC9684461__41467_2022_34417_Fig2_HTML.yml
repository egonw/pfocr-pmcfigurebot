figure_title: Some mutant Tail-GFP molecules are localized constitutively in the nucleus
caption: Tail (amino acid 351 until 521 of the XRN1 sequence) was fused to GFP and
  was expressed under ADH1 promoter and terminator. Nup49-RFP (a nucleoporin) was
  used as a nuclear marker. a During optimal proliferation, Tail is mainly cytoplasmic.
  b Tail-GFP shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus. Tail-GFP localization was examined
  by the import assay, as in Fig. . Photos were taken after 2 h at 37 °C. c-e Mutant
  Tail-GFP molecules that are constitutively localized to the nucleus. The Tail sequence
  of Tail-GFP was randomly mutagenized by PCR mutagenesis protocol and introduced
  into WT strain by transformation. Distinct colonies were allowed to proliferate
  in 96 wells. The cellular localization of the mutants was automatically scanned
  by fluorescence microscopy using a robot. Shown are some of the mutants that were
  localized to the nucleus in optimally proliferating cells. See Fig. S for positions
  of the mutations. f TailS454Pnuclear import is mediated by NLS1. NLS1 of TailS454P
  was mutagenized (resulting in TailS454P, ΔNLS1), and the mutant was analysed as
  in c. g Localization of mutant Tail-GFP in temperature-sensitive (ts) nuclear-import
  mutant. A shuttling assay, using cells that express nup49-313 and co-expressed xrn1S454P
  and RPB7-RFP (as a positive control), was performed as described previously. h Quantification
  of the shuttling assay. The nuclear/whole-cell ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity
  was determined by ImageJ, as described in Methods. Each box represents the 25th
  to 75th percentile of values, with the median noted by the horizontal bar. Whiskers
  terminate at maxima/minima or a distance of 1.5 times the IQR away from the upper/lower
  quartile, whichever is closer. n = >100 cells examined over 3 independent experiments.
  P-value was calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test. ** - p < 0.01. ns – not significant.
