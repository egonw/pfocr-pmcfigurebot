  are altered in msil2/4 mutant
caption: '(A) MS-based quantitative comparison of Col-0 and msil2/4 inflorescence
  stem proteomes. Volcano plot displaying the differential abundance of proteins in
  Col-0 and msil2/4 cells analyzed by MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics.
  The volcano plot represents the -log10 (limma p-value) on y axis plotted against
  the log2 (Fold Change msil2/4 vs Col-0) on x axis for each quantified protein. Green
  and red dots represent proteins found significantly enriched respectively in msil2/4
  and Col-0 Arabidopsis stems (log2(Fold Change)≥1 and -log10(p-value)≥2.29, leading
  to a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR = 1.01 %). The up-regulated proteins involved the glucuronoxylan
  biosynthetic pathways are indicated. (B) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the proteins
  that are significantly up-regulated in the msil2/4 mutant. The gene ontology analysis
  of DEGs was performed using ShinyGO v0.76 software. Lollipop diagrams provide information
  about GO fold enrichment, significance (FDR in log10), and number of genes in each
  pathway. (C) Schematic model of glucuronoxylan substitution patterns in Arabidopsis
  and the enzymes involved. IRX9/10/14, glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis
  of xylan (Xy) backbone. ESK1, eskimo1. GUX1, glucuronic acid substitution of xylan1;
  GXM3, glucuronoxylan methyltransferase3 are involved in the glucuronoxylan decoration.
  (D) Neutral monosaccharide composition of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) extracted
  from inflorescence stems of wild-type and msil2/4 mutant plants that have been pre-hydrolyzed
  or not with acid. Rha, rhamnose; Fuc, fucose; Ara, arabinose; Xyl, xylose; Man,
  mannose; Gal, galactose; Glc, glucose. (E) Left: Immunofluorescence labeling of
  transverse sections of Col-0 and msil2/4 stems with the LM10 and LM11 antixylan
  antibodies. Representative fiber and xylary regions analyzed by immunofluorescence
  are outlined. Xy, xylem fibers; if, interfascicular fibers. Right: Quantification
  of the fluorescence was done using ImageJ software and processed according to .
  Significant differences are indicated by asterisks*, p-value <0.01 according to
  Student’s t test (n=5–12).'
