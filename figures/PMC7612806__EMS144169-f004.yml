figure_title: Association of KYN metabolites with metabolic syndrome score and fatty
  liver index
caption: X-axes show standardized scores of metabolic syndrome score (MetS) and fatty
  liver index (FLI). Forest plots show the differences (95% CI) in MetS (left) or
  standardized score of FLI (right) of children at 8 years with change in each standardized
  score of cord KYN metabolite or ratio (Y-axis). Models were adjusted for sex and
  ethnicity. Total sample size (N) is not always 552 due to the missing values for
  outcomes.
