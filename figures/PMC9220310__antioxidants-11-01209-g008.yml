caption: The effect of CA was checked using (A) Western blotting results and quantitative
  measurements of (B) Nrf2, (C) HO-1, and (D) COX-2 protein expression in sham group,
  OA-control, and CA-treated group animals. The data from the three individual experiments
  were attained; GAPDH was used as the internal standard. RT-PCR was employed for
  the (E) MMP-3 and (F) MMP-13 mRNA expression in the FLS cells, stimulated ROS levels
  with IL-1β and then treatment with CA (50 and 100 μM) for 24 h, and β-actin was
  used as an internal standard. Data expressed as mean ± S.D. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001.
