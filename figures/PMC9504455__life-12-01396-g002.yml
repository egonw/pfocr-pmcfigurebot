caption: Relation between genes involved in glycogen-selective autophagy and autophagy,
  genes shared with apoptotic pathway, and genes encoding regulatory factors, such
  as transcription factors and non-coding RNA (miRNAs, lncRNA and circRNA) as a complex
  network for the discovery of modifier genes and new therapeutic strategies for glycogen
  storage diseases.
