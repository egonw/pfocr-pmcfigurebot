caption: Effect of pinostrobin on the Akt-related signaling pathways. (a) Western
  blotting revealed the alteration of Akt and GSK3β signals in 3T3-L1 cells in the
  presence of pinostrobin for 48 h of the early differentiating process. There was
  significant reduction of (b) p-Akt/Akt and (c) p-GSK3β/GSK3β levels in cells treated
  with 10 and 20 μM pinostrobin. (d) The modulation on AMPK-ACC pathway, a downstream
  of Akt signal, was also detected in pinostrobin-treated 3T3-L1 cells. Activation
  of AMPK-ACC signal was evidenced by upregulated (e) p-AMPKα/AMPKα and (f) p-ACC/ACC
  levels. Data represent the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05 compared with vehicle control cells
  (C) treated with 0.5% DMSO.
