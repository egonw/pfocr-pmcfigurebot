caption: a Splicing factor hnRNPE1 promotes proximal 5′ splice‐site selection in exon
  12, thus inducing the production of PNUTS mRNA. The absence of hnRNPE1 facilitates
  the generation of the lncRNA-PNUTS isoform, which promotes tumour development by
  competitively binding with miR-205 to upregulate ZEB1. b IFNγ promotes the generation
  of the PD-L1-lnc isoform and PD-L1-lnc activates the transcriptional activity of
  c-myc through the formation of a heterodimer with Max to promote the development
  of tumours. c In oral squamous cell carcinoma, exon 2 and 3 skipping of ORAOV1 pre-mRNA
  leads to the formation of the lncRNA ORAOV1-B isoform, which activates the TNF-κB/TNFα
  loop pathway by binding with HSP90.
