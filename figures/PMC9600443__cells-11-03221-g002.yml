caption: Transcriptomic profiling of whole-cell lysate of HL-60 cells at 0.5 and 1
  h after ATRA treatment. (a) Venn diagram shows intersection of differentially expressed
  transcripts (DETs) at 0.5 and 1 h after the ATRA treatment. DETs expression differences
  (fold change > 2, p-value < 0.05) (b) at 0.5h and (c) at 1 h after the ATRA treatment
  compared to control. Red triangles indicate DETs involved in the interleukin-10
  signaling pathway, purple circles indicate DETs with nuclear localization, blue
  circles indicate DETs involved in the cell surface receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007166),
  black circles indicate DETs involved in the apoptotic process (GO:0006915) and red
  circles indicate DETs involved in both the cell surface receptor signaling pathway
  and the apoptotic process. TF indicates DETs with transcription factor activity
  (PC00264), p53 reg with an arrow indicates DETs that are involved in p53 regulation
  (R-HSA-3700989). (d) TFs ID1, JUN, and HIC1 expression differences (fold change
  > 2, p-value < 0.05) at 0, 0.5, and 1 h after ATRA treatment.
