caption: MKP-2 Silencing Promotes Cell Cycle Arrest in Breast Cancer Cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells were transfected with MKP-2 siRNA (10 nM) for 72 h and then treated with the
  indicated concentrations of Dox for 24 h. (A) Representative cell cycle distribution
  was analyzed by flow cytometry. (B) Cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE
  and assessed for Cyclin B1 and p-Cdc2 (Tyr15). Each value represents the mean ±
  S.E.M of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001,
  compared with the correspondent control.
