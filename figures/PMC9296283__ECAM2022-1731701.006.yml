caption: 'Curcumin pretreatments alleviated mitochondria damage in oxygen-glucose
  deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-injured astrocyte. (a) Flow cytometry detection
  of alterations in JC-1 (fluorescence color reflecting alterations in the mitochondrial
  membrane potential). (b) Summary of data of the alterations of mitochondrial membrane
  potential. (c) Summary of data showing levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP). (d–g) Representative images and summarized data for relative protein expressions
  of phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (p-DRP1; Ser 637), DRP1, and mitofusin
  2 (MFN2) by western blot analysis. (h) Representative images of transmission electron
  microscopy of astrocytic mitochondria. Versus control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, respectively; versus OGD/R group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P
  < 0.001 (n = 3).'
