caption: Analysis of DEGs in seeds of two rice varieties (JXZ and MXXZ) in response
  to high humidity. A The number of DEGs in different comparison groups. B Venn diagrams
  illustrate the overlap of DEGs among different comparisons. C Scatter plot of the
  top 20 KEGG pathways for the DEGs in JXZ-T vs. JXZ-C. D Scatter plot of the top
  20 KEGG pathways for the DEGs in MXXZ-T vs. MXXZ-C. The x-axis indicates the gene
  ratio of DEGs belonging to the corresponding pathway, and the y-axis represents
  the enriched pathways. The size of each point indicates the number of DEGs, and
  the colour represents the range of the corrected P value. "JXZ-C," "JXZ-T," "MXXZ-C,"
  and "MXXZ-T" indicate the control (C) and PHS-induced (T) samples of the JXZ and
  MXXZ varieties, respectively
