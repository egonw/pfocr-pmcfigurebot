caption: 'BMSCs inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis of cardiac tissue in each group. A. Representative
  images of apoptotic cells stained green with TUNEL in cardiac tissue. Total nuclei
  were stained blue with DAPI. B. Quantitative analysis of apoptotic rate. TUNEL-positive
  cells (%) are expressed as (number of apoptotic myocytes/total myocytes) ×100%.
  C. Western blotting analysis of cleaved caspase 3 in each group. D. Densitometric
  analysis of western blotting for cleaved caspase 3. Values are expressed as mean ± SD
  (n = 6 rabbits); Original magnification ×200; Scale bar = 100 μm ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs
  Control; ##P < 0.01 and vs ###P < 0.001 vs RT.'
