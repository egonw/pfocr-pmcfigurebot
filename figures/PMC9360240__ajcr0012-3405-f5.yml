caption: 'SHMT2 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation by activating MAPK pathway.
  Western blotting analysis of proteins with phosphorylation or not related in MAPK
  signaling pathway in breast cancer cells with SHMT2 knockdown (A) and over-expression
  (B). Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay in HCC1806 cells with SHMT2 knockdown
  treated with an ERK inhibitor FR180204 (C) or a p38 inhibitor SB202190 (D). ZR-75-1
  cells with SHMT2 overexpression were treated with an ERK inhibitor FR180204 (E)
  or a p38 inhibitor SB202190 (F). # represents the comparison between inhibitor plus
  SHMT2 over-expression group and SHMT2 over-expression group. * represents the comparison
  between treatment group and control group. #, *P < 0.05. Student’s t-test. The data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. The error bars show the SD.'
