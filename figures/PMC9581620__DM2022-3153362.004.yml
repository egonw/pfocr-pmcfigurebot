caption: Role of YTHDF2 silencing in inflammatory cytokines and p53 mRNA stability
  in M1/M2 macrophages. M0 macrophages were subject to 24-h transfection using YTHDF2
  siRNA (si YTHDF2) or si-NC before M1 (a) or M2 (b) stimulation. Actinomycin D (5 μg/mL)
  was then applied for inhibiting mRNA transcription for a 0-, 2-, and 4-h period.
  mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β, and P53 were determined through qRT-PCR,
  with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. Results are indicated by mean ± S.E.M.
  (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01. The red and blue lines stand for M1 and M2-stimulated
  cells, respectively.
