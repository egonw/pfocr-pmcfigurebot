caption: Transcriptome profiles of HT22 cells treated with myriocinHT22 cells treated
  with myriocin (0.5 μM) for 36 h were analyzed for differential expression genes
  (DEGs, n = 3, p < 0.05).(A) Disease and DEGs correlation network. The size of the
  knots represents the p value of DEGs, and the red and green color represent the
  up- and downregulated genes, respectively.(B) Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for
  up- and downregulated DEGs (BP, biological process, CC, cell component, MF, molecular
  function).(C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up- and downregulated DEGs. Numbers
  of enriched genes, enrichment scores, and FDR are presented.(D) Circular dendrogram
  of the top four KEGG clusters.
