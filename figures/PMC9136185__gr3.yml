caption: 'Effect of the FAM83D-mediated AKT/mTOR pathway on the proliferation of glioma
  cells. A, MTT assays were conducted to evaluate the proliferation ability of U87
  and U251 cells; B, Colony formation assays were conducted to determine the colony
  formation of U87 and U251 cells; C, Comparison of the colony numbers between U87
  and U251 cells; * P < 0.05 vs. the Mock group; # P < 0.05 vs. the siFAM83D group;
  & P < 0.05 vs. the FAM83D group; % P < 0.05 vs. the MK2206 group.'
