caption: 'Effects of autophagy on proliferation and apoptosis of PFC cells. (a) The
  cell proliferation of PFC cells were examined by CCK-8 assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC
  group. #P < 0.05 vs. PFC + BLM group. (b) The cell apoptosis of PFC cells were examined
  by CCK-8 assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01vs. PFC + BLM group.'
