caption: Immune related analysis. A The mean proportion of 22 immune cells in the
  Target database. B Violin diagram of the difference in expression of 22 immune cells
  infiltration between the high and low expression groups of DIO3OS in 85 osteosarcoma
  samples in the TARGET set. Blue represents the low expression group, red represents
  the high expression group. C Correlation heat map of 22 immune cells in the TARGET
  set. D In low expression of DIO3OS group, CD200 and TNFRSF25 expression were inhibited
  and CD44 expression were increased. E–G Scatter plots of the expression correlation
  between CD44, CD200, and TNFRSF25 and DIO3OS. P-value of less than 0.05 is considered
  statistically significant (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001;
  ****, p < 0.0001)
