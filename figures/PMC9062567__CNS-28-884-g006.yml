caption: Circ_0055412 modulates NFATC3 expression through sequestering miR‐330‐3p.
  (A) Potential target genes of miR‐330‐3p were demonstrated via Venn diagram. (B)
  The expression of predicted 6 mRNAs was analyzed through RT‐qPCR when miR‐330‐3p
  was overexpressed. (C) Binding sequences between miR‐330‐3p and NFATC3 was displayed.
  (D) RIP assay was carried out to evaluate the binding relationship among circ_0055412,
  miR‐330‐3p and NFATC3. (E) The binding between miR‐330‐3p and NFATC3 was confirmed
  by luciferase reporter assay. (F‐G) The mRNA and protein level of NFATC3 was analyzed
  in the sh‐NC group, sh‐circ_0055412#1 group and sh‐circ_0055412#1+miR‐330‐3p inhibitor
  group. **p < 0.01
article_title: Knockdown of circ_0055412 promotes cisplatin sensitivity of glioma
  cells through modulation of CAPG and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
