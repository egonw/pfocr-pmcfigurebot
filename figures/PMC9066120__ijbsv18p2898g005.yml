caption: MHO7 suppressed tumor growth and pulmonary metastases in tumor-bearing mice.
  (A) Diagram of procedure for mouse tumor model. (B) The Observation of the primary
  tumors. (C) Tumor growth and the final tumor weights were measured in mice. (n=6).
  Data was presented as mean ± SEM. (D) Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 expression in tumor
  tissues were analyzed by H&E staining and IHC staining. Scale bar, 50 µm. (E) Lung
  tissues in mice was analyzed by H&E staining, and the tumor areas were indicated
  by the black circle. *P <0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <0.001; and ****P < 0.0001.
