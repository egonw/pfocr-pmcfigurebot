caption: Ischemia/reperfusion injury upregulates Fn1 expression in mouse heart tissues
  and STEMI patients. (a) qPCR analysis the mRNA expression of Fn1 (n = 4 per group).
  (b) Immunoblotting analysis of Fn1 protein levels in the I/R heart (upper). Quantification
  of the protein band (bottom, n = 4). GAPDH as an internal control. (c) Fn level
  in blood samples of normal controls (n = 30) and STEMI patients (n = 30). Data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.005; ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 versus
  the sham or normal control.
