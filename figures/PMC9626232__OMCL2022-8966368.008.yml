caption: TF3 induced cell death in OS cell lines via ROS accumulation. (a) Colony
  formation assay of MG63 and HOS cells treated with 160 μM TF3 with or without 2 mM
  NAC for 24 h and statistical analysis of the colony formation assay results. (b)
  Flow cytometry of MG63 and HOS cells treated with 160 μM TF3 with or without 2 mM
  NAC for 24 h and quantitative analysis of the flow cytometry results. (c) Western
  blotting and statistical analyses of MAPK signalling pathway-related proteins, including
  p-JNK, p-P38, p-ERK, JNK, P38, and ERK, in MG63 and HOS cells treated with 160 μM
  TF3 with or without 2 mM NAC for 24 h. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n
  = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 vs. the vehicle control
  group.
