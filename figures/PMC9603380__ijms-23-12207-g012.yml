caption: 'The NF-κB activation pathway via TLR4 and the mode of action of pharmacological
  probes formulated to block TLR4 receptor in different signaling steps. TLR4 activation
  by ligands (LPS or hrGGT) triggers the TLR4 signaling cascade that activates NF-κB,
  allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate TF gene transcription. Inhibitors
  are shown in red: LPS-Rs is an extracellular TLR4 antagonist, CLI-095 is an intracellular
  TLR4 signaling inhibitor, and BAY-11-7082 is a specific NF-κB inhibitor. The figure
  was created through the website “biorender.com”.'
