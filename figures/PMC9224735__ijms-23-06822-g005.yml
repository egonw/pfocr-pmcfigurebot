caption: 'STAT3 aggravated LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis in HD11 cells: (A,B)
  The mRNA expression level of STAT3 was increased in coccidia-infected samples and
  LPS-induced inflammation in HD11 cells, as detected by qRT-PCR. (C,D) The expression
  levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in LPS-stimulated HD11 cells with STAT3 overexpression
  and knockdown were detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA. (E,F) Cell apoptosis was detected
  with Annexin V–FITC/PI double-staining via flow cytometry assay. Data are presented
  as means ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).'
