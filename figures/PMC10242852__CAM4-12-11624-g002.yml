caption: Increased MAPK4 expression may be a prognostic indicator and is significantly
  correlated with glioma progression. Overexpressed MAPK4 was correlated with poor
  prognosis of total glioma patients in OS (A, B), DSS (C) and DFI (D). (E) Overall
  survival analysis of MAPK4 expression of different histological types. (F, G) Overall
  survival analysis of MAPK4 in 1p/19q non‐codeletion and 1p/19q codeletion group.
  (H) Overall survival analysis of MAPK4 in deferent primary therapy outcome groups.
  (I, J) Disease specific survival analysis of MAPK4 in astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma,
  non‐codel 1p/19q codeletion and codel 1p/19q codeletion groups. (K, L) The univariate
  (K) and multivariate (L) cox regression analysis were performed in TCGA cohort and
  shown by forest plot.
