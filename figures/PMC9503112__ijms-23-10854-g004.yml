caption: Compound 7c suppresses the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. (a–i) MCF7 cells
  were treated with different concentrations of 7c or 500 nM wortmannin (W) for 24
  h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related
  total or phosphorylated (p) proteins (a–f) and PARP1/cleaved PARP1 (g,h). (i) Control
  α-tubulin. (j,k) The ratios of p-proteins to total ones for compound 7c (circles)
  or wortmannin (triangles) (j) and cleaved PARP1 to full PARP1 (k) as measured by
  ImageJ program from two independent experiments.
