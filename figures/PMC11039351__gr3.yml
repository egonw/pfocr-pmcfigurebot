caption: 'The lipidome of L-adipomes is distinct from that of S-adipomes(A and G)
  Principal component analysis (PCA) score plot of the lipid profiles from CLA and
  ILA (A), and ILA and ISA (G) showing clusters of two groups.(B and H) Heatmap representation
  of the clustering analysis of top 25 differentially abundant lipid molecular species
  (with lowest FDR-adjusted p-values) based on z-scores for the normalized, transformed,
  and scaled data between CLA and ILA (B), and ILA and ISA (H). For class names, red
  represents CLA or ILA and green represents ILA or ISA. For the abundance of each
  lipid, red represents high, and blue represents low.(C and I) Volcano plots represent
  significantly altered lipid metabolites in ILA compared to CLA (C), and ISA compared
  to ILA (I). Red dots indicate upregulated lipids and blue dots indicate downregulated
  lipids.(D) KEGG pathway analysis revealed seven dysregulated metabolic pathways
  enriched in ILA compared to CLA. All matched pathways were plotted according to
  p-value and pathway impact score from pathway enrichment analysis and pathway topology
  analysis, respectively. Color gradient: yellow, higher p-value; and red, lower p-value.
  Circle size: large, higher impact score; and small, lower impact score.(E and F)
  Pathway representation of Sphingolipid metabolism (E) and Glycerophospholipid metabolism
  (F) with lipid metabolites (highlighted in red) enriched in ILA. Data represents
  the mean (n = 3 per group). Abbreviations: CLA, control large-adipomes; ILA, infected
  large-adipomes; and ISA, infected small-adipomes.'
