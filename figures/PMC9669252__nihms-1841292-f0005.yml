figure_title: PARPi-resistant BRCA2-deficient cells increase fork protection via suppressing
  EZH2/MUS81 pathway
caption: (a) Fork stabilization was determined by DNA fiber assay as described in
  . The schematic is shown above. Plots of IdU/CldU tract length ratios for individual
  replication forks in treated cells are shown below the schematic. (b) Western blotting
  of EZH2, MUS81, and GAPDH in cells with or without olaparib treatment. Densitometric
  values of EZH2 and MUS81 relative to GAPDH are shown. (c) Immunoblotting of EZH2
  and MUS81 in cells transfected with or without siRNAs against EZH2 or MUS81. (d)
  DNA fiber assays were performed to study replication fork protection as mentioned
  in (a). CldU/IdU pulse-labeling followed by a 2-hour olaparib (20 Î¼M) with or without
  silencing of EZH2 or MUS81. Dot plots of IdU to CldU tract length ratios for individual
  replication forks in treated cells are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p
  < 0.001; ns, not significant.
