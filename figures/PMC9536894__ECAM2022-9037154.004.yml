caption: Core targets were screened and enrichment analysis was performed. (a) The
  screening process of core targets. (b) GO functional annotation of core potential
  targets of SYD. Biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular
  functions (MF) were ranked according to −log (P values). (c) KEGG enrichment analysis
  for core targets of SYD. The color represented the −log (P values), and the size
  represented the gene count. (d) The signaling pathway of SYD in the treatment of
  asthma. The red node is the potential therapeutic target of the drug.
