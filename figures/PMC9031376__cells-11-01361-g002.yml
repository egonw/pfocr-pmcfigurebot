caption: Loss of Trp53 and Rb1 in Ctsk-expression activates YAP/TAZ signaling. (A)
  Schematic presentation of primary osteosarcoma cells from Ctsk-Cre;Trp53f/f/Rb1f/f
  mice. (B) Western blot analysis of YAP and TAZ expression in primary osteosarcoma
  cells and normal cortical bone cells. (C) Representative images of immunofluorescent
  staining of YAP/TAZ in the primary osteosarcoma cells and normal cortical bone cells
  as indicated. Scale bars, 10 μm. (D) The normal cortical bone cells or primary osteosarcoma
  cells with/without 2 μmol VP were co-transfected with 8xGTIIC and pRL-TK plasmids
  (internal control) as indicated, respectively. After transfection of 48 h, the luciferase
  activities were identified by the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit. (E) The primary osteosarcoma
  cells were treated by 2 μmol VP or DMSO (control) for 48 h, the protein levels of
  YAP and TAZ were identified as indicated. (F) qRT-PCR analysis of YAP/TAZ target
  genes CYR61 and CTGF in the normal cortical bone cells or primary osteosarcoma cells
  cultured with/without 2 μmol VP for 48 h as indicated. Error bars were the means
  ± SEM from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
