caption: Vitamin C enhances erastin-induced ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells
  in vivo. (a, b) Images and weights of xenograft tumors from various mouse groups
  after 14 days of treatment. (c, d) The tumor volume and mouse body weight were measured
  every two days. (e–g) Combination treatment with erastin and vitamin C reduced GSH
  (e) and increased the MDA (e) and ferrous iron levels (g). (h) A schematic showing
  that vitamin C sensitizes PC cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis via GSH depletion
  and ferrous iron overload (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001).
