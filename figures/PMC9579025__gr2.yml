caption: Differential gene expression in the DLS between WT and iMSN-D2RKO sham(A)
  Volcano plot based on the −log10 adjusted p value versus the log2 Fold Change (FC)
  of the DLS transcriptome. Cut-offs are shown as dotted lines (p-adj < 0.01) and
  log2FC ± 20%.(B) Heat-map representing the single mouse z-score (distance of each
  raw score from the mean) of the 251 statistically significant DEG (p-adj < 0.1).(C)
  Representative Western blot analyses of LRRK2 from WT and iMSN-D2RKO sham DLS protein
  extracts. Protein concentration was normalized on ⍺-tubulin. Quantifications are
  shown in the graph as fold change with the WT arbitrarily set to 1. t-test significant
  for ∗p < 0.01.(D) KEGG pathway analysis of enriched pathways containing the 252
  DEGs between WT and iMSN-D2RKO sham mice. KEGG p-value <0.05 (-Log10), the numbers
  in brackets represent the number of genes in each pathway. See also .
