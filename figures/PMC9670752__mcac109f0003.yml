caption: 'Schematic of the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to red flavonoid pigments
  and the occurrence of biosynthetic enzymes in different land plant lineages. A coloured
  circle next to an enzyme step indicates that that activity is present in the corresponding
  plant lineage (indicated by the colour key). A white circle with a grey outline
  indicates that it is not present in that lineage. A grey circle with a grey outline
  indicates that there is some support for the presence of the enzyme, from either
  sequence analysis or presence of the biosynthetic product, but that definitive evidence
  is lacking. With regard to proposed biosynthetic branches: the biosynthetic route
  to sphagnorubins is unknown but may be via 3-deoxyanthocyanidins; the biosynthetic
  route to auronidins is only partly characterized and, although auronidin 4-O-neohesperidoside
  can be present at relatively low amounts, auronidins principally accumulate as cell
  wall-bound aglycones. Enzyme abbreviations are: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHIL, chalcone isomerase-like; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; FNR, flavanone reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  FGTs, flavonoid O-glycosyltransferases; F3GT, flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  F5GT, flavonoid 5-O-glucosyltransferase; AUS, aureusidin synthase; FNS, flavone
  synthase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3ʹH, flavonoid 3ʹ-hydroxylase; F3ʹ5 ʹH, flavonoid
  3ʹ,5ʹ-hydroxylase.'
