caption: Effects of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glutamine (Gln) on starch synthesis
  in atg5 mutants. Physcomitrella atg5 colonies cultured on a BCDAT agar medium were
  transferred to BCDATG liquid medium containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 1 mM Gln, or water
  (as a solvent control) and cultured under light conditions. The starch content of
  colonies was measured immediately (0 d) and 2 d after transfer. Data are shown as
  means Â± SD (n = 3). Different letters denote significant differences from each other,
  p < 0.01).
