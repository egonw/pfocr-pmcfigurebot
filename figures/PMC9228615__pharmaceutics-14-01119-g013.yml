caption: 'Effects of BP-LCNs on expression levels of proteins related to migration
  in A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence or presence
  of BP-LCNs (final concentration 5 µM). The figure shows protein expression levels
  of DKK1 (A), CTSB (B), CTSD (C), BCLX (D), CSF1 (E), and CAPG (F). The protein expression
  levels were determined using an oncogene protein array kit and by quantifying pixel
  densities of the respective proteins. The values represent means ± SEM of 3 independent
  experiments. Note: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Abbreviations: BP-LCNs,
  berberine–phytantriol liquid crystalline nanoparticles; DKK1, Dickkopf Wnt signaling
  pathway inhibitor 1; CTSB, cathepsin B; CTSD, cathepsin D; BCLX, bcl-2 like protein,
  CSF1, colony stimulating factor 1; and CAPG, capping actin protein.'
