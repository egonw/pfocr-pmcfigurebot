caption: Drosophila NF-κB pathway, a simplified schematic representation. The Imd
  and Toll pathways are shown on the left and right, respectively. Upon infection
  with Gram-negative bacteria, the Imd pathway is activated through direct recognition
  of Gram-negative bacterial PGN by PGRP-LC at the cell surface. This creates a transient
  signaling platform resulting also in the transcription activation of genes encoding
  AMPs. 1, 2, and 3 indicate successive stages of the Imd pathway activation. In response
  to both Gram-positive cocci and fungi, Spz (Spatzle) is processed into a biologically
  active ligand and binds to the Toll receptor. This interaction initiates a proteolytic
  cascade that results in the transcription activation of genes encoding AMPs. AP-1,
  activator protein 1 transcription factor; Ben, Bendless (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme, an Ubc13 homolog); Cact, Cactus; Cad, Caudal; Diap2, Diap protein 2; Dif,
  transcription factor Dorsal-related immunity factor; Dl, transcription factor Dorsal;
  Dredd, Death related ced-3/Nedd2-like caspase (also known as Dcp2); Eff, Effete
  (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, an Ubc5 homolog); Fadd, Fas-associated death domain;

  protein Myd88; Nub, Nubbin; Pirk, Poor Imd response upon knock-in; Pli, Pellino
  (a RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase); Pll, Pelle, the serine/threonine
  kinase ortholog of IRAK; PGN, peptidoglycan; PGRP-LC, Peptidoglycan recognition
  protein LC; PGRP-LE, Peptidoglycan recognition protein LE; Rel, Relish; Tab2, Tak1-associated
  binding protein 2; Tak1, (TGF-β)-activating kinase 1; Tg, Transglutaminase; Trbd,
  Trabid; Tub, adaptor protein Tube; Uev1A, Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant 1A
  (Ubc/E2 variant (Uev) homolog); Zfh1, Zn finger homeodomain 1. For the other proteins
  shown in the scheme, the symbols and the full names are identical. Arrows and bar-headed
  lines indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Phosphate groups are depicted
  as solid black dots. Ubiquitin chains are shown as a string of white circles. Protein
  complexes are encircled by dashed lines. Inactive components of the pathway are
  shown in semi-transparent mode. Effects of mutations, depletion or overexpression
  of protein molecules on adult fly lifespan are color-coded according to the legend
  at the bottom; different simultaneous effects are shown as color gradients (for
  the references, see ).
