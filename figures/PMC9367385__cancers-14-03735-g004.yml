caption: 'Downregulation of SH3TC2 inhibited tumor progression and promoted cell apoptosis.
  (A) Comparison of SH3TC2 expression in three CRC cell lines via Western blotting.
  (B) The qRT-PCR and quantitative Western blotting analyses revealed no expression
  difference among the three cell lines. (C) Expression of SH3TC2 was significantly
  downregulated in HCT116 and LOVO cell lines after transfection with three SH3TC2
  siRNAs. (D) The qRT-PCR and quantitative Western blotting analyses revealed that
  SH3TC2 was significantly downregulated in HCT116 and LOVO cells after siRNA transfection.
  (E) Downregulation of SH3TC2 significantly improved cell apoptosis. (F) Downregulation
  of SH3TC2 significantly decreased cell invasion ability. (G) Downregulation of SH3TC2
  significantly decreased cell proliferation. The statistical analysis was compared
  to the control or normal groups: ns, not significant; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
