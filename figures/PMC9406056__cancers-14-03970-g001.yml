caption: 'The modulation of neurotransmitters on common molecular pathways. Neurotransmitters
  mediate the transformation of extracellular ligand signaling into intracellular
  signaling through multiple kinds of receptors, thus, affecting cell proliferation,
  migration, metabolism, apoptosis, autophagy, survival, differentiation and angiogenesis.
  The main intracellular signaling includes RTK pathways, GPCR pathways, apoptosis
  and autophagy signaling pathways. The activation of RTKs and GPCRs are associated
  with Ca2+ flux, which has been considered as the initial impulse and critical modulator
  of GBM signaling. All neurotransmitters can be identified by GPCRs, while ACh, Glu,
  GABA and ATP secretion activate Ca2+ flux via ionotropic receptors. GPCR mainly
  consists of three families: (i) Gaq/11 family (including M1/3/5 mAChR, mGluR I,
  5−HTR2, P2Y and Y1/2), (ii) Gi/o family (including M2/4 mAChR, mGluR II/III, GABABR,
  D2−4, P1 and 5−HTR1/5) and (iii) Gs family (including D1/5, NK−1R, 5−HTR4/6/7, β−AR
  and P1). The mTOR pathway plays a vital role in autophagy induction. NF−kB has been
  shown to get involved in tumorigenesis, tumor growth and tumor response to drugs
  as a transcription factor. Apoptosis is mainly related to two mechanisms: (i) the
  extrinsic pathways initiated by pro-apoptotic ligands and (ii) the intrinsic pathways
  mediated by mitochondrial permeabilization. Neurotransmitters become involved in
  the activation of pro−caspase−8/9/10/3.'
