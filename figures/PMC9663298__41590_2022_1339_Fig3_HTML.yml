figure_title: IL-17D activates the CD93–p38 MAPK–AKT–SMAD2/3 signaling pathway to
  inhibit DDX5
caption: a, Immunoblot of Ddx5 in lesional skin from MC903-treated wild-type and Cd93–/–
  mice. b, RT–qPCR of Il4, Il13, Tslp, Ccl11, Ccl17 and Ccl22 in lesional skin from
  MC903-treated wild-type and Cd93–/– mice (n = 7). c, Immunoblot of DDX5 in NHEKs
  treated with 2.3 nM IL-17D 24 h after transduction of CD93-targeted siRNAs. d,e,
  Immunoblot (d) or RT–qPCR (e) of DDX5 in NHEKs 24 h after treatment with the STAT3
  inhibitor S3l201, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  inhibitor LY294002, MEK inhibitor PD98059, JNK inhibitor SP600125, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ (PPARγ) inhibitor GW9662, nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated
  B cells (NFκB) inhibitor PDTC, SMAD2/3 inhibitor SB431542 and AKT1/2 kinase inhibitor
  with or without 2.3 nM IL-17D. Con, Control; DMSO, Dimethylsulfoxide. f, Immunoblot
  of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and p38 MAPK in NHEKs transduced with CD93-targeted siRNA
  and treated with 2.3 nM IL-17D for 0–45 min after 24-h CD93 silencing. g, Immunoblot
  of p38 Mapk, Akt, Smad2/3 and their phosphorylation in lesional skin from MC903-treated
  wild-type and Cd93–/– mice. h–j, Immunoblot of p38 MAPK, AKT, SMAD2/3 and their
  phosphorylation in NHEKs treated with SB202190 (h) or AKT1/2 kinase inhibitor (i)
  or SB431542 (j) in the presence of 2.3 nM IL-17D for 0–75 min. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  and ***P < 0.001. NS, not significant. P values were determined by unpaired, two-tailed
  Student’s t-test (b) or two-way ANOVA (e). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.
