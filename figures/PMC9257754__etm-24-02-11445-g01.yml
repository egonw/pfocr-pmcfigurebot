caption: Microscopy of primary pulmonary fibroblasts and the effect of IL-10 on the
  biological function of the fibroblasts. (A) Immunohistochemistry detection of vimentin
  in primary pulmonary fibroblasts. Magnification, x100. (B) Viability of primary
  pulmonary fibroblasts after treatment with IPF serum in the absence or presence
  of IL-10 antibody. CCK-8 assay was used to determine viability. *P<0.05 compared
  with NC group. (C) Percentages of primary pulmonary fibroblasts at G1, S and G2
  phases of cell cycle. Flow cytometry was performed to investigate the cell cycle.
  *P<0.05 compared with NC group. (D) Expression of COL1a1 and COL1a2 proteins in
  primary pulmonary fibroblasts. Western blotting was used to determine protein expression.
  *P<0.05 compared with NC group. NC, negative control group (untreated primary pulmonary
  fibroblasts); IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; PI, propidium iodide; COL1a1,
  collagen type I α 1 chain; COL1a2, collagen type I α2 chain.
