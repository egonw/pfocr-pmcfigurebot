figure_title: Pathway enrichment analysis
caption: 'Top Panel: Mouse. Lower Panel: Human. Top 10 significantly enriched GO terms
  (BP, CC, MF) per ARG cluster based. A, C: The dot plot of enriched terms for the
  three ARG subsets indicates the number of genes per GO term for each gene cluster,
  and the colour indicates the level of the adjusted p-value. B, D: Heatmap of hierarchical
  clustering of enriched terms for the three clusters. Circle sizes indicate gene
  number per term.'
