caption: PFAO markers and differences in pentose phosphate pathway flux in Hepa-1
  cells. (a) Acetate content significantly increased in Hepa-c4 cells in response
  to hypoxia (p < 0.05, n = 5). (b) Hypoxic Hepa-c4 cells released more hydrogen peroxide
  into the media (p < 0.05, n = 5) (c) Nucleic acid ribose synthesis via the oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway was higher in Hepa-c4 than WT cells in both normoxia and
  hypoxia (p < 0.02 and p <0.01, respectively, n = 4). (d) Nucleic acid ribose re-assembly
  via the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was slightly lower in Hepa-c4 than
  WT cells (p < 0.05), but was not substantially affected by hypoxia in either cell
  line. (e) Diagram showing flux differences and changes between the two Hepa-1 cell
  types in normoxia and hypoxia. N, normoxia; H, hypoxia (1% O2); arrows pointing
  upwards suggest significant increase for a given comparison. * Indicates differences
  in metabolic flux (↑ increased flux; ↓ decreased flux) due to HIF deficiency and
  hypoxia, which were inferred from changes in the relevant 13C-labelled isotopomers;
  *↑ and *↓ fluxes were inferred from concentration changes in the substances indicated,
  not their 13C-labelling. Panels (a–e) show data expressed as mean ± SEM; statistical
  significance assessed by unpaired two-tailed t-test.
