caption: DSB repair models. Lines represent single DNA strands and arrowheads indicate
  3’ ends. Dotted lines correspond to newly synthesized DNA and are colored to match
  the template. Pink and gray boxes are regions of hetDNA and gene conversion, respectively.
  The canonical DSBR pathway, in which both broken ends engage a repair template,
  is shown in the center. Cleavage of the two HJ intermediates in the same direction
  (both junctions horizontal or both vertical) generates a non-crossover (NCO) product,
  while cleavage in different directions leads to a crossover (CO). During SDSA (left
  side), only a single end interacts with the repair template and only NCOs are produced.
  NCOs generated by DSBR and SDSA can be distinguished by hetDNA position relative
  to the initiating DSB. BIR (right side) reflects either repair of a one-ended break
  or of a two-ended break when one end is lost. Following invasion of the repair template,
  conservative DNA synthesis restores the end of the broken duplex. See text for additional
  details.
