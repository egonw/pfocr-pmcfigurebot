caption: 'ICAT is critical for the metastatic effects in CRC. (A and B) ICAT‐overexpressing
  SW480 and HCT116 cell lines were transfected with siRNA against ICAT or negative
  control for 24 h. Western blotting and real‐time RT‐PCR analyses of ICAT expression
  in the transfected cells. (C and D) Wound healing assay was performed in indicated
  SW480 and HCT116 cells. Representative images (left; scale bars: 100 μm) and quantitation
  of the extent of wound healing (right). (E and F) Transwell assay (left; scale bars:
  100 μm) shows the migration and invasion of the indicated cells. The number of migrated
  cells (right) groups were counted. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.'
