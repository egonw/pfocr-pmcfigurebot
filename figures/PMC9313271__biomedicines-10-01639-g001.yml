caption: Main effector cells and signaling pathways in the initial stage of vitiligo.
  Vitiligo immunopathogenesis is characterized by a complex inflammatory cascade that
  is initiated by innate immune cells (DCs, NK cells, and ILC-1 cells) which recognize
  signals from stressed melanocytes (DAMPs and PAMPs). Following activation, innate
  immune cells begin to produce IFN-γ, which activates JAK/STAT pathway and causes
  keratinocytes to produce the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. These chemokines are in
  responsible for recruiting CD8+ cells to the skin via the CXCR3 receptor, where
  the effector phase of the anti-melanocyte immune response occurs. CD8+ lymphocytes
  are an additional source of IFN-γ as well as the cytolytic molecules perforin and
  granzyme-B, capable of inducing melanocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, CXCL10 can induce
  melanocyte apoptosis via CXCR3B. CXCL9, CXC chemokine ligand 9; CXCL10, CXC chemokine

  molecular patterns; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STAT1, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1.
