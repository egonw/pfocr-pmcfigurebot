caption: Results of proteomic analysis. A. Canonical pathway analysis. The charts
  of the top statistically enriched pathways according to the -log10 B-H-corrected
  p value calculated in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Fisherâ€™s test). Numbers indicate
  the number of DEPs associated with each pathway. The same pathways were enriched
  in both comparisons, but the statistical significance was different. B. Heatmap
  representing identified proteins and members of the ubiquitination pathway. C. Unsupervised
  PCA performed on the total number of proteins identified in all experimental groups.
article_title: Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant myeloma cells show increased
  activity of all three arms of the unfolded protein response.
