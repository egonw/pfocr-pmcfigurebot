caption: 'Biosynthesis of isofumigaclavine A in P. roqueforti: (a) Isofumigaclavine
  A biosynthetic gene cluster A and B in P. roqueforti. Those genes encoding proteins
  with uncharacterized role in this biosynthetic pathway (Proq02g028380 and Proq02g028400)
  are indicated with black arrows; (b) Isofumigalavine A biosynthetic pathway in P.
  roqueforti. The festuclavine synthase activity corresponds to the activity of two
  duplicated proteins encoded by ifgF1 and igF2 (represented as ifgF). The ifgH gene
  encoding the festuclavine hydroxylase is not located in Cluster A or B, and it is
  denoted with an asterisk. DMA-PP (dimethylallyl pyrophosphate); PP (pyrophosphate).
