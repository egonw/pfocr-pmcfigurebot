caption: Systematic perspectives of current CSGs(A) Examples of CSGs associated with
  multiple cancer types.(B) Distribution of CSGs in tissue systems.(C) Number of sex-differentially
  expressed CSGs by tissue types.(D) Sex-specific CSGs with differential expression
  in human tissues. CSGs that were not differentially expressed by sex in any of the
  tissues were not included in the analysis. Example of sex-differential expression
  of CSGs in specific tissue such as brain was highlighted in red box.(E) Assessment
  of pathways affected by CSGs. The update CSGs were submitted to g:Profiler for pathway
  analysis, and the top 10 pathways were visualized.
