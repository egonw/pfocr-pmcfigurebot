caption: 'GALNT1 positively regulates the β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer
  cells. A, GSEA plots showing the Wnt/β-catenin pathways of differentially expressed
  genes altered by GALNT1 in patients with gastric cancer from the TCGA database.
  B, Correlation of GALNT1 and β-catenin in gastric cancer from TCGA database were
  analyzed. C-F, Western blotting analysis-based detection of protein expression of
  β-catenin, phospho-β-catenin (S675) and its downstream target c-Myc in MKN45 (C),
  SGC7901 (D) and AGS (E) cells after knockdown of GALNT1, as well as in the AGS cells
  after overexpression of GALNT1 (F). G-J, Protein expression of β-catenin in the
  cytoplasm and nucleus of MKN45 (G), SGC7901 (H), and AGS (I) cells after knockdown
  of GALNT1 as determined by western blot analysis, as well as AGS cells after overexpression
  of GALNT1 (J). K-M, Nuclear translocation of β-catenin examined by immunofluorescence
  assays in GALNT1-silenced MKN45 (K), SGC7901 (L), and AGS (M) cells. Scale bar:
  50μm.'
