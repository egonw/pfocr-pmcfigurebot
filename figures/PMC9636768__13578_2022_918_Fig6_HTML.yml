caption: SAL alleviates Aβ pathology and restores neurite morphology in AD mice via
  SIRT3 action. A IHC staining of Aβ (red) and Iba1 (green) in hippocampi of 5×FAD
  mice. Nuclei counterstained with DAPI (blue). White rectangles indicate amplified
  images at lower panels. B As in A, except Aβ (red) and GFAP (green) are stained.
  Quantification shows the Aβ+ areas (C), Iba1+ areas (D) and GFAP+ areas (E). F The
  tracing images show the morphology of Golgi-stained CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice
  with indicated treatments. Orange triangle indicates the soma. G Sholl analysis
  of images collected in F. Significant differences are found in 50 μm to 100 μm (X-axis)
  in 5×FAD+SAL group compared to 5×FAD (**P < 0.01) or 5×FAD+SIRT3KD+SAL group (##P < 0.01).
  H Quantification of total dendrite length of cells in F. I Golgi-stained images
  show the morphology of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Quantification
  shows the spine density on apical dendrites (J) and basal dendrites (K). Data mean ± SD
  from at least 12 slices of 6 mice. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; one-way
  ANOVA. White scale bar, 500 μm; black scale bar, 50 μm; orange scale bar, 5 μm
