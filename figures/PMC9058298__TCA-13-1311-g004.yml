caption: hnRNPK knockdown affected lung cancer cell proliferation, migration and cell
  cycle progression. (a) Expression of hnRNPK protein in hnRNPK‐knockdown cell lines
  and negative controls was detected by western blotting. β‐actin was used as a loading
  control. (b) Expression of hnRNPK mRNA in hnRNPK‐knockdown cell lines and negative
  controls was detected by PCR. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control. (c–h) Lung
  cancer cell proliferation was measured by CCK‐8 and colony formation assays. (i–j)
  Lung cancer cell migration was measured by transwell assay. (k–n) Flow cytometry
  analysis of cell cycle distribution in each cell line. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K promotes the progression
