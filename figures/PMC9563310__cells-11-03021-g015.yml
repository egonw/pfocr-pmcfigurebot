caption: (A) Metformin was inefficient to protect Bmal1-depleted SRA-hLECs against
  H2O2-induced oxidative cell death. Metformin-treated or untreated SRA-hLECs infected
  with LV sh-control or LV sh-Bmal1 (Da) were exposed to H2O2 as shown in Figure.
  MTS assay with Bmal1 knock-down showed that Metformin fails to promote LECs survival
  against H2O2 induced oxidative cell damage. All histograms are presented as mean
  ± S.D. values derived from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
  (B) Similar to Bmal1-knock down experiment (A), Nrf2- knockdown experiment demonstrated
  that Metformin provided cytoprotective activity via Bmal1/Nrf2 protective pathway.
  Metformin-treated or untreated transfectants containing sh-Control or sh-Nrf2 SRA-hLECs
  (Ea) were exposed to H2O2 as indicated in figure. MTS assay with Metformin-treated
  transfectants containing shRNA specific to Nrf2 showed a significant reduction in
  cell viability compared to control counterpart. All histograms are presented as
  mean ± S.D. values derived from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p
  < 0.001. (C,D) Metformin could be efficacious in defending younger or aged hLECs
  from H2O2 induced oxidative stress. Metformin-treated or untreated primary hLECs
  (4 × 103) were exposed to H2O2, and Metformin’s effects on cell viability (C) and
  ROS level (D) were determined at 24 h and 3 h using MTS and H2-DCF-DA dye assays,
  respectively and shown. All histograms are presented as the mean ± S.D. from three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001.
