caption: 'Down‐regulation of miR‐579‐3p in patients developing HCC. (A,B) Dot plots
  of nCounterNanostring probe intensity values representing gene expression levels
  of miR‐579‐3p in (A) each patient remaining tumor free or developing HCC and (B)
  interindividual differences between first and second biopsies for each patient.
  (C,D) qPCR analysis of miR‐579‐3p in the validation cohort of patients remaining
  tumor free and developing HCC. Each point represents 1 patient and is reported as
  (C) 2‐dct and (D) interindividual difference between first and second biopsies.
  (E) Fluorescence in situ hybridization for miR‐579‐3p (blue, DAPI; red, probe for
  miR‐579‐3p; bar, 10 µm). (F) qPCR analysis of miR‐579‐3p expression in various liver
  cancer cell lines. Data are reported as 2‐ddct in relation to miR‐579‐3p expression
  in HuH‐7 cells. Each bar, mean ± SD of one experiment done in triplicate; *P < 0.05.
  Abbreviations: DAPI, 4´,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole; dct/ddct, change (delta) in
  cycle threshold; HL, hepatic lobule; n.s., not significant; PA, portal area.'
