caption: 'Interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) signaling was the top enriched pathway related to
  triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) bone metastasis according to gene enrichment
  analysis. A, Principal components analysis (PCA) of the gene set in GSE20611. B,
  Volcano plot of the DEGs (left: Dor vs. Par; right: PDor vs. Dor). Dor, MDA‐MB‐231
  with weakly bone metastatic variants; PDor, MDA‐MB‐231 reactivated cells with high
  bone metastatic activity after dormancy in bone metastases; and Par, parental MDA‐MB‐231
  cells. p < 0.05 and |fold change (FC)| > 2 were set as the criteria for differential
  expression. C, Cluster analysis of the DEGs. D, Venn diagram showing the overlapping
  DEGs. E, Heatmap of the 312 candidate DEGs obtained from (D). F, Results of Reactome
  enrichment analysis with the 312 candidate DEGs. Pathway classification (G), top
  10 pathways (H), and pathway distribution (I) results of the Reactome enrichment
  analysis. J, Protein‐protein interaction (PPI) network of the 312 candidate DEGs
  and the top 10 proteins according to the MCC score with Search Tool for the Retrieval
  of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) PPI network functional enrichment analysis.
  K, PPI network of the top 10 genes in (J). L, Pathway activity analysis of the top
  10 genes in (J) using GSCALite. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; MCC, maximal
  clique centrality'
