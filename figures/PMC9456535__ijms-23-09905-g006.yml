caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription
  PCR (qRT-PCR) assays between the biofilms of the WT and ∆ftcR strains: (A) Heatmap
  showing the expression levels of 13 transporter and binding proteins between the
  biofilms of the WT and ∆ftcR strains. (B) The 13 transporter and binding proteins’
  expression levels were further detected by qRT-PCR. Error bars represent standard
  error (n ≥ 3). * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, unpaired Student’s t-test.'
