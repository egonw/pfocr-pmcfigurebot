figure_title: UPF2KO cells fail to activate the ATM-regulated DNA damage response
  pathway
caption: A. Plots showing mean intensity of γH2AX-Ser139 staining in the nuclei of
  parental and UPF2KO AGS and HGC27 cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of AZD6738. Mean values and SD are indicated with a black dot and bar, respectively,
  and p-values were calculated using a Welch two sample t-test. B. Western blot analyses
  of lysates from parental and UPF2KO AGS cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of AZD6738. ß-actin is shown as a loading control. C. Survival curves of parental
  and UPF2KO AGS cells treated with AZD1775 (WEE1i), PF477736 (CHK1i) or AZD0156 (ATMi).
  Cell counts were determined using an Incucyte Zoom system and normalized to DMSO
  control. Data is plotted as mean ± SD; n = 8. D. Plots showing mean intensity of
  pH2AX-Ser139 staining in nuclei of parental and UPF2KO AGS cells treated with 1000
  nM AZD6738, 500 nM AZD1775, 500 nM AZD0156 or a DMSO control. Mean values and SD
  are indicated with a black dot and bar, respectively, and p-values were calculated
  using a Welch two sample t-test. E. Cell cycle analysis bar graphs showing the percentage
  of FastFUCCI labeled parental and UPF2KO AGS cells treated with either DMSO or the
  indicated nM concentrations of AZD1775 (WEE1i), PF477736 (CHK1i) or AZD0156 (ATMi)
  for 24 hours. Data are shown as mean ± SD; n = 3. p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  ****p<0.0001, ns = non-significant.
