caption: RIG-I-like receptor protein domain structure. The three RLRs are DExD/H-box
  helicase proteins of type SF2 that contain the conserved domains Hel1 and Hel2 in
  their core DExD/H-box helicase domain. The Hel2i insertion domain, essential for
  RIG-I autoregulation, is located between the two helicase domains. A broadly conserved
  C-terminal region is also present in all RLRs (CTD). A positively charged binding
  pocket is present only in the CTD of RIG-I to identify 5′-PPP or 5′PP RNA substrates.
  Two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains are shared by RIG-I and
  MDA5 (CARDs). For interactions with MAVS and the start of downstream antiviral signaling,
  several CARDs must be aligned.
