caption: Aging and cellular senescence in human skeletal muscle (SkM). (a) Quantification
  of p16 expression by qPCR in SkM biopsy specimens from younger (n = 30) and older
  (n = 22) women and men (Two-tailed unpaired t test). (b) Representative images and
  (c) quantification of P16-positive nuclei by IHC staining (n = 5 per age group).
  (d) Comparison of p21 expression by qPCR between young (n = 29) and older (n = 22)
  SkM biopsies specimens. Representative images of TAF staining (e) and quantification
  of TAF-positive nuclei (f) (n=10 per age group, two-tailed unpaired t test). (g)
  Pearson correlation analysis between SkM gene expression and functional measurements
  including maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, ml/kg/min), leg one-repetition maximum
  (AU) normalized to fat-free mass (kg) of the leg (Leg1RM), and maximal mitochondrial
  oxygen consumption (State 3) after the addition of saturating concentrations of
  adenosine diphosphate (pmol/s/mg tissue), with Pearson r value on the left bottom
  corner and p value on the right top corner. (h) GSEA plot of the p53 signaling pathway,
  the chemokine signaling pathway, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions that
  were significantly enriched based on DEGs by RNA-seq between younger and older human
  SkM. (i) Heatmap of expression of core genes in the enriched pathways. Two-tailed
  unpaired t test was used; error bars represent the standard error of the mean. **
  and *** denote p < 0.01 and 0.001 respectively.
