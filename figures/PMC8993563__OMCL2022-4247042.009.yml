caption: COS attenuated oxidative and inflammatory injury in H2O2-stimulated KGN cells.
  The protective effects of COS were manifested in inactivating the HIF-1α-VEGF signaling
  pathway, attenuating OS, decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines, and
  improving mitochondrial damage caused by H2O2 in KGN cells.
