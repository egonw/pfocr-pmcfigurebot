caption: 'PLD activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the femurs of chronic SCI
  mice. (A) SOST, Wnt3a, Lrp5 and ctnnb1 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR method.
  (B) Immunoblot showing active β-catenin and total β-catenin levels. The protein
  levels of β-catenin were adjusted as relative values to GAPDH. Data are expressed
  as mean ± S.D.; n=5 to 7 per group; *P < 0.05, vs. the Sham group; #P < 0.05, vs.
  the SCI group.'
