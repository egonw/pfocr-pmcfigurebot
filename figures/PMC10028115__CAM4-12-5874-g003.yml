caption: The regulatory role of hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cervical
  cancer cells by targeting LAMB3. (A) To perform pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG)
  on LAMB3 differential genes high/low expression group to study the functional pathways
  closely related to LAMB3. (B, C) Investigate hsa‐mir‐133a‐2 and LAMB3 expression
  regulations in cervical cancer cells on signaling pathway PI3K/AKT through WB experiments.
  (D) Utilize AKT inhibitor LY294002 to regulate the phosphorylation level of AKT
  in siha and caski cells. (E) Analyze phosphorylated AKT in cervical cancer cell
  invasion by using transwell invasion experiment. (F, G) The effect of phosphorylated
  AKT on cervical cancer cell growth was detected using the CCK8 assay. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
