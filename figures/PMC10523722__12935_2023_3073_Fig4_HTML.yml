caption: FAP suppresses apoptosis and enhances ccRCC progression. A FAP content in
  the ccRCC cell lines (Caki-1, ACHN, A498) and normal cell line (HK-2). B QRT-PCR
  was used for quantifying FAP expression levels in Caki-1 cells and ACHN cells upon
  transfection. C, D Flow cytometry was used to measure Caki-1 as well as ACHN cell
  apoptotic activities post-transfection. E, F After transfection, the CCK-8 assays
  were performed to detect cellular viability in Caki-1 and ACHN cell lines at 24,
  48, 72, and 96 h. * p < 0.05 vs. the Ctrl group
article_title: FAP promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression via activating
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
