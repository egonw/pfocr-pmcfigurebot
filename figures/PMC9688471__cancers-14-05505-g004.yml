caption: 'GSDME, rather than GSDMD, was involved in GA-induced pyroptosis in CRC cells.
  (A) Expressions of GSDMD, GSDME, and cleaved caspase-3 in HCT116 and CT26 cells
  treated with GA for 12 h were analysed by western blotting. (B) The expressions
  of Bcl-2 and Bax in HCT116 and CT26 cells treated with GA were analyzed by western
  blotting. The cells were exposed to 0.1% DMSO as control. All experiments were repeated
  three times and results were expressed as mean Â± SD. CASP-3, caspase-3, Con, control,
  NS: not significant. NS p > 0.05 vs. control, * p < 0.05 vs. control, ** p < 0.01
  vs. control. The whole western blots were shown in .'
