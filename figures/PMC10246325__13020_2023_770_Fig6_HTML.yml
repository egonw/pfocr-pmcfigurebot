caption: Excessive accumulation of ROS further activates the ROS-MAPK pathway. A The
  combination of cisplatin (50 μM) or paclitaxel (0.5 μM) with FJHQ (800 μg/mL) significantly
  increased the levels of JNK and P38 phosphorylation. B Increased P-JNK in the FJHQ + Cis
  or FJHQ + PTX groups was reversed by NAC. C AS601245 and SB203580 both reversed
  the synergistic effect of combined treatment of FJHQ with chemotherapy drugs (***P < 0.001,
  multiple comparison ANOVA and Q < 0.85 indicated an antagonistic effect). FJHQ Fangjihuangqi
  Decoction, Cis Cisplatin, PTX Paclitaxel
