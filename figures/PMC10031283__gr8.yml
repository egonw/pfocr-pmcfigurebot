caption: Inhibition of PKCβII via bezafibrate or overexpression of a dominant-negative
  mutant of PKCβII is negatively associated with cancer pathways. (A) The experimental
  scenario of the RNA sequencing of the LM-MCF-7 cell line. The 107 cells were treated
  with plasmid pcDNA-PKCβII-DN (10 μg) or BZF (10 μmol/L) for 48 h. (B, C) Volcano
  plot and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between the control group and BZF-treated
  group. (D, E) Volcano plot and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between the control
  group and PKCβII-DN-expressing group. (F) KEGG pathway analysis of 692 overlapping
  DEGs. (G) Fold change in mRNA levels of 5 oncogenes determined by RT-qPCR assays.
  LM-MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 μmol/L BZF or transfected with the plasmid pcDNA-PKCβII-DN.
  (H) Fold changes in mRNA levels of 5 oncogenes in lung metastatic foci from BALB/c
  nude mice performed by RT-qPCR assays. Columns with error bars symbolize the average
  of three independent replicates ±SD. Three experiments with consistent results tendency
  were repeated by two-tailed Student's t test. ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗P < 0.05.
