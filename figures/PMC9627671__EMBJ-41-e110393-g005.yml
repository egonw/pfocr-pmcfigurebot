caption: A, B Double strand repair efficiency in wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs. DSB
  repair reporter constructs were integrated into hMSCs. After 72 h recovery, reactivation
  of the GFP reporter was measured by flow cytometry. Stimulation of NHEJ or HR was
  calculated as the ratio of GFP+/DsRed+ positive cells. Asterisks indicate P < 0.05.
  n = 3 BR; error bars = SD. Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.C Cell viability in MMS‐treated
  wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs. hMSCs were treated with MMS for 48 h and cell viability
  was evaluated by MTS assay. Data were normalized to the control group (0 mM). Asterisks
  indicate P < 0.05. n = 6 BR; error bars = SD. Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.D Immunofluorescence
  staining of 53BP1 in wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs under MMS treatment. Numbers
  of 53BP1 foci in the nuclei of wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs with or without MMS
  (0.25 mM) treatment were quantified. >600 nuclei from 10 TR images were scored.
  Asterisks indicate P < 0.05. Error bars = SD. Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.E qRT–PCR
  of NRF2 stress response pathway genes in wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs. n = 3 BR;
  error bars = SEM. Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.F RNAseq expression of NRF2 stress
  response pathway genes in wild‐type and centSIRT6 hMSCs. n = 4 BR; error bars = SEM.
  Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.G Western blot analysis of SIRT6 in wild‐type and centSIRT6
  hMSCs. β‐Actin was used as a loading control and used to normalize quantification.
  Asterisks indicate P < 0.05. n = 2 BR; error bars = SD. Student's t‐test, two‐tailed.  Source
