caption: 'The functional microbiome regulates Th2-biased cytokine immune responses
  by inhibiting SA-derived IL-4/IL-13 axis activation. (a) Boxplots of gene expression
  values for IL-4R and IL-13RA1 stratified by an abundance of S. hominis and C. avidum
  in AD and Pso cohorts. (b) Measurement of mRNA level of IL-4 relative to 18S rRNA.
  (c) Measurement of mRNA level of IL-13 relative to 18S rRNA. (d) Measurement of
  mRNA level of IL-6 relative to 18S rRNA. (e) Measurement of the mRNA level of IL-24
  relative to 18S rRNA. (f) Measurement of mRNA levels of STAT3 and STAT6 relative
  to 18S rRNA. (g) Measurement of mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 relative
  to 18S rRNA. (h) Measurement of the concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β cytokines
  using ELISA after treatment with S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3 derived microbial
  supernatants in the SA treatment group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared
  to SA only treatment group. ### p < 0.001 between S. hominis R9 and C. avidum R-CH3.
  ns: not-significant compared to; ns: not-significant compared to SA only treatment
  group. Statistical significance was calculated using Bonferroni tests.'
