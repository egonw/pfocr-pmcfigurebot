caption: 'FSCN1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cells. (a) qRT-PCR
  for detecting the mRNA level of FSCN1 in prostate cancer tissue (PCa tissue) and
  the corresponding adjacent tissue (adjacent tissue), ∗∗P < 0.01; (b, c) western
  blot to detect the protein expression level of FSCN1 in the PCa group and the adjacent
  tissue group, and the relative protein expression level was analyzed, ∗∗P < 0.01;
  (d) qRT-PCR to detect the mRNA expression level of FSCN1 in WPMY-1, PC-3, and DU145
  cells; (e, f) western blot for the detection of the protein level of FSCN1 in WPMY-1,
  PC-3 and DU145 cells, and the relative protein expression level was analyzed. ∗∗P
  < 0.01 vs. WPMY-1, ##P < 0.01, and #P < 0.05 vs PC-3.'
