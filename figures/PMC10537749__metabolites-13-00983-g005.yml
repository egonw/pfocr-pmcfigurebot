caption: Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and KEGG pathway enrichment of metabolome
  data. (A,B), the heatmap of significantly DMs identified in ESI− (A) and ESI+ mode
  (B) in PWB iPSCs as compared to the control ones; C and D, enriched KEGG pathways
  related to the perturbed metabolic networks involving DMs identified in ESI − (C)
  and ESI + mode (D); the enriched metabolic pathways are indicated by color (−log10
  (p value)) and size (black ball, enrichment ratio). PWB_3921_9d, PWB_4221_3d, and
  Control_52521_8d were experimental duplications of PWB_3921_9, PWB_4221_3, and Control_52521_8,
  respectively.
