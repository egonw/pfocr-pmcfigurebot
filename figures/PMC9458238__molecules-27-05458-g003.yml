caption: Components that differentiated samples of patients with a different outcome.
  Panel (A)—the number of spectral components with a different Cohen’s [d] effect
  size between different pairwise compared tissue regions; the relative number of
  components [%] with increased significance of differences is color-coded in a heat
  map. Panel (B)—the network of interactions between 74 proteins, the tryptic fragments
  of which were putatively identified as spectral components downregulated in T-ROI
  (compared to N-ROI) in the PD group specifically; interaction between proteins and
  over-represented Reactome pathway functions associated with these proteins according
  to an analysis using the STRING toolbox [] (color-coded are proteins associated
  with 3 most numerous overrepresented pathways, shown is corrected p-value of pathway
  over-representation). Panel (C)—Venn diagram showing the overlap between MSI components
  downregulated in T-ROI (vs. N-ROI) in PD group, upregulated in clusters relatively
  enriched in T-ROI (vs. N-ROI) in NED group, and upregulated in a cluster enriched
  in T-ROI in NED group. Panel (D)—the correlation between ITH (the Simpson’s diversity
  index computed for the first level of image segmentation) and Lymphocytic Host Response
  (LHR) [] assessed by histopathology analysis in corresponding specimens (w/i—weak/intermediate,
  i/s—intermediate/strong); number of samples with different LHR in the NED and PD
  groups (bottom; “w/i” and “i/s” were combined with “intermediate”); * indicates
  statistical significance (p < 0.05).
