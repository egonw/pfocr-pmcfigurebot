caption: 'Hypothesis. Fucoidan may modulate oxidative stress and PI3K/AKT/mTOR in
  metabolic regulations. Oxidative stress and PI3K/AKT/mTOR can reciprocally induce
  or suppress each other. The antioxidant system also regulates oxidative stress.
  Fucoidan can modulate oxidative stress and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, but their impacts on fucoidan-modulated
  metabolisms are rarely investigated. Accordingly, fucoidan may trigger oxidative
  stress and PI3K/AKT/mTOR to control several metabolic functions. Abbreviations:
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; FA, fatty acid; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation.'
