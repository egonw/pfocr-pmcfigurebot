caption: SEMA6D was recognized as a negative regulatory target of miR-7. (a) Bioinformatics
  prediction showed an overlapping sequence between miR-7 and SEMA6D. (b) The results
  of dual-luciferase assay demonstrated the existence of a direct interaction between
  miR-7 and SEMA6D. (c) qRT-PCR indicated that SEMA6D level was down-regulated when
  there was an overexpression of miR-7, and SEMA6D level increased when miR-7 was
  down-regulated. ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01 between groups. ∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.001 between
  groups.
