caption: Ubiquitin‐specific peptidase 10 (USP10) is abundantly expressed in pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma (PAAD) tissues signaling pathway enriched on the positive side of
  the YAP1 according to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA and cells and positively
  correlated with YAP1. (A) Hydrolysis‐related); (B) genes show high correlation with
  YAP1 analyzed using a correlation test (cor. Test); (C) USP10 expression in TCGA‐PAAD
  and GTEx databases; (D) association between USP10 level and the prognosis of patients
  analyzed in TCGA‐PAAD; (E) staining intensity of USP10 in the PAAD tissues and normal
  pancreatic tissues in the HPA system; (F and G) expression of Cyr61 (F) and CTGF
  (G) in TCGA‐PAAD; (H and I) positive correlations between CTGF (H) and Cyr61 (I),
  and USP10 examined by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; (J) expression of
  USP10 in PAAD cell lines (Capan‐2, AsPC‐1, Panc‐1, and BxPC‐1), and in the normal
  HPDE6 cells determined by RT‐qPCR. Differences were analyzed by one‐way ANOVA (J),
