caption: (A) Molecular structure and (B) three-dimensional structure of (+)-Apl-1
  (downloaded from PubChem); (C–F) qPCR-measured relative expression of (C) CCL2,
  (D) ICAM1, (E) SELE and (F) IL6 genes in HUVECs under indicated treatments for 6
  h; in each case, expression was relativized to the actin beta gene (ACTB) and normalized
  to the TNF-α positive control; (G) Flow-cytometry-measured ICAM-1 levels in HUVECs
  under indicated treatments for 16 h; percentage of expressing and non-expressing
  ICAM-1-cells (ICAM+ and ICAM1-) are represented; (H) Representative Western blot
  images of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and α-tubulin levels in HUVECs under
  indicated treatments for 16 h; (F) Densitometric quantification of VCAM-1 and α-tubulin
  bands in (G) and two additional independent experiments, VCAM-1 signals were relativized
  to α-tubulin and normalized to the TNF-α positive control. In panels (C–G,I), means
  and standard deviations of three independent replicates are represented and statistical
  analyses were performed through t-tests; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
