caption: 'Upregulated METTL3 was associated with the malignant progression and poor
  prognosis in PC. A. METTL3 mRNA levels were upregulated in PC tissues compared to
  adjacent tissues (FC = 2.991, P = 0.001, FDR = 0.028) using RNA microarray (3 pairs
  of PC and adjacent tissues). B. METTL3 mRNA levels were higher in PC tissues than
  in the adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.000) based on the GEO database (GDS4103, 39
  pairs of PC tissues). C. METTL3 mRNA was higher in PC tissues than in the adjacent
  tissues (P = 0.002) in 30 pairs of PC tissues collected from our hospital. D. More
  than half of PC tissues (16 out of 30, 55.0%) had two-fold higher METTL3 mRNA levels
  than the adjacent tissues. E. The protein expression of METTL3 was examined in seven
  pairs of PC tissues by western blotting. The protein levels of METTL3 in PC tissues
  were higher than in the adjacent tissues, which were consistent with the mRNA levels.
  F. In the subcategory analysis of the 30 pairs of PC tissues, METTL3 mRNA levels
  were higher in stage II/III PC tissues than in stage I PC tissues (P < 0.001). G.
  In the subcategory analysis of the 30 pairs of PC tissues, METTL3 mRNA levels were
  higher in PC tissues with lymph node metastasis (N1/N2) than in PC tissue without
  in lymph node metastasis (N0) (P < 0.001). H. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated
  a negative association between METTL3 mRNA expression and PFS (P = 0.035). I. METTL3
  expression was examined in PC cells and HPNE cells using qPCR. The results showed
  that METTL3 expression was higher in PC cells than in HPNE cells. J. METTL3 expression
  was examined in PC cells and HPNE by western blotting. The results showed that METTL3
  expression was higher in PC cells than in HPNE cells. K. The immunofluorescence
  assays confirmed that METTL3 levels were significantly higher in PC cells than in
  HPNE cells. The bar chart was the quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity
  of METTL3. Scale bar: 20 µm. L. METTL3-knockdown cell lines were established by
  infected PC cells with METTL3 shRNA lentivirus (sh-1, sh-2, and sh-3). The inhibitory
  efficacy was examined using qPCRand the results showed that METTL3-sh2 showed the
  highest inhibitory efficacy. M. METTL3-knockdown cell lines were established by
  infected PC cells with METTL3 shRNA lentivirus (sh-1, sh-2, and sh-3). The inhibitory
  efficacy was examined by western blotting and the results showed that METTL3-sh2
  showed the highest inhibitory efficacy. N. The clone formation assay indicated that
  the knockdown of METTL3 reduced the number of clone formation of PC cells. Representative
  images were displayed and the bar charts showed the differences of clone number
  between METTL3-knockdown PC cells and NC cells. *: P < 0.05. O. The CCK8 assay indicated
  that the knockdown of METTL3 reduced the proliferative capacity of PC cells. *:
  P < 0.05. P. The wounding healing assay indicated that the knockdown of METTL3 reduced
  the migratory capacity of PC cells. Representative micrographs were displayed and
  the bar charts showed the differences of migratory area between METTL3-knockdown
  PC cells and control cells. *: P < 0.05 magnification: 100 ×. Q. The transwell assay
  indicated that the knockdown of METTL3 reduced the migratory and invasive capacity
  of PC cells and fewer PC cells migrated/invaded to the lower side of the membrane.
  Representative micrographs were displayed and the bar charts showed the differences
  of migrated or invaded cell numbers between METTL3-knockdown PC cells and control
  cells. *: P < 0.05, magnification: 100 ×. Abbreviations: PC: pancreatic cancer,
