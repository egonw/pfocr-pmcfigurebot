caption: 'Metabolome characteristics of neonatal jaundice. A, Corrplot of correlations
  of differential metabolites; corr test P < 0.05 was considered significant. When
  the linear relationship between two metabolites was enhanced, it tended to be near
  1 for a positive correlation and − 1 for a negative correlation. B, Metabolic pathway
  enrichment bubble plot: the vertical coordinate with the bubble indicates the P-value
  of the enrichment analysis, taking the negative logarithm of the natural number
  e as the base (i.e., for the -lnP-value, darker colors indicate a smaller P-value
  and a more significant enrichment).'
