caption: (A)—Gene expression of LTBPs and TGF-β isoforms in PF; (B)—Gene expression
  of canonical TGF-β signaling pathway receptors in PF; (C)—Gene expression of canonical
  TGF-β signaling pathway molecules in PF; (D)—Gene expression of non-canonical TGF-β
  signaling pathway molecules in PF. AA—allergic asthma; HS—healthy subjects; SNEA—severe
  non-allergic eosinophilic asthma. AA, n = 4, SNEA, n = 4, HS, n = 4. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM, fold change over control PF. * p <0.05 compared with control PF;
  ** p < 0.01 compared with control PF; *** p < 0.001 compared with control PF; §
  p < 0.05 compared with HS eosinophil effect. Statistical analysis between investigated
  groups—two-sided Mann–Whitney U test (independent data); two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs
  signed-rank test (dependent data); and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which was used
  for gene expression analysis against control PF that were not incubated with eosinophils.
