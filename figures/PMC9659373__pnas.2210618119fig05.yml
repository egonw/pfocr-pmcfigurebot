caption: Coamplification of PI4KB and PIP5K1A as a frequent event to activate PI3K
  signaling in TP53-mutant breast cancer. (A) OncoPrint of PI4KB, PIP5K1A together
  with TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN in human breast cancer (n = 2,173). (B) Overall survival
  of the breast-cancer patients with different mutation status of TP53 and PI3K-related
  genes (PI4KB, PIP5K1A, PIK3CA, and PTEN). (C) Relapse-free survival of the breast-cancer
  patients with different mutation status of TP53 and PI3K-related genes. Patients
  that had mutations in TP53, but not in other genes, were designated as MUT in TP53
  only; patients that had mutations in PI3K-related genes, but not in TP53, were designated
  as MUT in PI3K pathway only; patients that had mutations in both TP53 and one of
  the PI3K-related genes were designated as both; and all other patients were designated
  as no alterations.
