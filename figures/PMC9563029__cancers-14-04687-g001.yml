caption: 'BRAFV600E induction in mouse thyrocytes triggers stromal reaction which
  correlates with major changes in immune signaling pathways. (A) Hematoxylin–eosin
  staining of thyroid tissue from control (CTL) and doxycycline-treated mice, from
  Day 1 to Day 4. (B,C) Enriched signaling pathway revealed by MouseMine software
  using differentially expressed genes from total RNA sequencing (B) of Day 2 (n =
  4) compared to CTL (n = 4) thyroids and (C) of Day 4 (n = 4) compared to CTL (n
  = 4) thyroids. (D) mRNA fold change of the most deregulated chemokines (CXCL1, CCL7,
  CCL8) and their receptors (CXCR2, CCR1, CCR2) found in RNA sequencing data (green
  dots) and measured by RT-qPCR (white and blue boxes) of CTL (n ≥ 5) and doxycycline-treated
  mice, after 2 (n = 11) and 4 days (n = 7) of injections (Day 2, Day 4). mRNA fold
  changes are normalized to the geometric mean of Rpl27 and Gapdh expression and compared
  to control group. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (* p < 0.05, # p < 0.01, $ p
  < 0.001).'
