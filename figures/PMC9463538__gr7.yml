caption: MAP3K4 kinase inactivation results in reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation
  of the IGF1R and IR because of reduced IGF1R and IR expression.A, kinase inactivation
  of MAP3K4 in TS cells results in reduced IGF1Rβ and IRβ expression and phosphorylation.
  Site 1 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1131 and pIRβ Tyr1146, site 2 represents IGF1Rβ Tyr1135
  and pIRβ Tyr1150, and site 3 represents pIGF1Rβ Tyr1136 and pIRβ Tyr1151. Western
  blot image is representative of 3 biologically independent experiments. B–I, densitometry
  was used to quantify 3 biologically independent experiments. Graphs show the mean ±
  SD. B and C, phosphorylation was normalized to ERK2. D and E, expression was normalized
  to ERK2. F and G, phosphorylation was normalized to IGF1Rβ. H and I, phosphorylation
  was normalized to IRβ. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; Student’s
  t test; two-way ANOVA. ERK2, extracellular-regulated kinase 2; IGF1R, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor; IR, insulin receptor; MAP3K4, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase 4; ns, not significant; TS, trophoblast stem; Insulin, 25 μg/ml.
