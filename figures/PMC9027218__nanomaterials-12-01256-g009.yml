caption: Metascape functional enrichment heatmap following the analysis of all 5%
  FDR-corrected DEGs (absolute FC â‰¥ 1.5, q-value < 0.05) after the exposure to 1 mg/kgbw/day
  of E171 in a Tg mouse model. Bar graphs of enriched terms across the input gene
  list are colored by p-values. Significantly altered genetic pathways included rhythmic
  processes, signaling, nuclear transcription pathway, retinol metabolism, negative
  regulation of defense responses, platelet-derived growth factor signaling, small
  cell lung cancer, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, O-linked glycosylation,
  and regulation of T-cell differentiation, confirming genetic alteration in pathways
  that were identified by ORA and STEM analysis.
