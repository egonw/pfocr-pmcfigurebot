caption: (Left Panel) Principal component analysis using the expression dataset of
  26 out of 251 significantly differentially expressed proteins between fluconazole
  treated and untreated OP cells, as well as untreated healthy control cells, that
  were implicated in the osteogenesis pathway. (Right Panel) Hierarchical cluster
  analysis with the heat map showing the expression changes of the 26-protein dataset
  among the sample groups. (OP_NoRx = osteopetrosis untreated; OP_10 Î¼M, osteopetrosis
  treated with fluconazole).
