caption: Parallel screens for PTPs regulating the Hippo pathway by the LATS-BS and
  STBS-Luc (YAP/TAZ reporter). The ratio of the LATS-BS (A) and STBS-Luc reporter
  (B) signals after cotransfection with phosphatases to that of LATS-BS or STBS-Luc
  alone was calculated based on fold changes. A fold change greater than 2 was considered
  significant and indicated as “*”.
