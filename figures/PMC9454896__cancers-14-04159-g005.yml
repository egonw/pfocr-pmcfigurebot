caption: The binding of SNHG1 to DNMT3A protein inhibited miR-129-5p expression and
  increased Rac1 expression in UMUC3 cells. (A, Left panel) The total protein extracts
  from indicated cells were subjected to Western blotting to determine the expression
  of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. (A, Right panel) Relative protein levels determined
  by densitometry and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin. (B) An RNA pull-down assay
  was employed to determine the interaction between SNHG1 and DNMT3A. Antisense RNA
  sequences of SNHG1 were used as negative controls (NC). (C, Left panel) The indicated
  cells were extracted, and protein extracts were subjected to Western blotting to
  determine DNMT3A, Rac1, and β-Actin protein expression. (C, Right panel) Relative
  protein levels determined by densitometry and expressed as ratios versus β-Actin.
  (D) Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels
  of miR-129-5p in the indicated cells. (E,F) UMUC3(SNHG1) cells and UMUC3(SNHG1/KO-DNMT3A)
  cells were subjected to a transwell invasion assay, and migration and invasion abilities
  were calculated and presented relative to the UMUC3(SNHG1) control. The results
  are presented as means  ±  SD from triplicate experiments, and asterisks (*) indicate
  a significant decrease in comparison to UMUC3(SNHG1) cells (p  <  0.01). Bars in
  (E) are equal to 100 μm.
