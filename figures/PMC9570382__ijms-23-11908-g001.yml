caption: 'MicroRNAs related to a single MAPK pathway in liver cancer. The MAPK signaling
  pathway is divided into three parts: ERK signaling pathway, p38 MAPK signaling pathway
  and JNK signaling pathway. Some microRNAs only affect liver cancer progression by
  participating in the ERK signaling pathway, while some microRNAs are associated
  with the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to regulate liver cancer progression. Some microRNAs
  function via the JNK signaling pathway. Most of these microRNAs regulate the MAPK
  pathway upstream to affect liver cancer.'
