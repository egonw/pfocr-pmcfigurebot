caption: 'GDNF/RET signaling pathway promotes glucose absorption and subsequently
  activates SREBP-1 through HBP. U251 and U87 glioma cells cultured in DMEM complete
  medium with (A) different dose of GDNF for 48 h or with (B) 50 ng/ml GDNF at indicated
  times and (C) in the presence or absence of 20 μM RPI-1 (GDNF/RET inhibitor). Glucose
  uptake ability of glioma cells evaluated by fluorescent glucose 2-NBDG. (D and E)
  Western blot analysis of total cell lysates (RET/p-RET, ERK/p-RET) or nuclear extracts
  (nSREBP-1) from U251 and U87 glioma cells cultured in DMEM glucose-free medium,
  treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF, 10 mM glucose or in combination with 20 μM RPI-1 for
  48 h. (F) Immunofluorescence staining of SREBP-1 (red) and DAPI (blue) from U251
  glioma cells cultured in DMEM glucose-free medium and treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF
  or 25 mM glucose or in combination with 20 μM RPI-1 for 48 h. Quantitative evaluation
  of SREBP-1 nuclear intensity using ImageJ (n=20). Images were captured at x200 magnification.
  (G) RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA levels in U251 and U87 glioma cells cultured in DMEM
  glucose-free medium and treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF, 10 mM glucose, or 20 μM RPI-1
  for 24 h. (H and I) Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts (nSREBP-1) from U251
  and U87 glioma cells cultured in DMEM glucose-free medium with or without 10 mM
  glucose, 10 mM lactate, 10 mM pyruvate, or 20 mM HBP or in combination with 20 μM
  azaserine (HBP inhibitor) for 48 h. (J) Western blot analysis of total cell lysates
  (RET/p-RET) or nuclear extracts (nSREBP-1) from U251 and U87 glioma cells cultured
  in DMEM glucose-free medium, treated with or without GDNF or in combination with
  20 μM RPI-1 or 20 mM HBP for 48 h. (K) RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA levels in U251 and
  U87 glioma cells cultured in DMEM complete medium and treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF
  and in the presence or absence of 20 μM azaserine for 24 h. (L) U251 and U87 glioma
  cells cultured in DMEM complete medium treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF and in combination
  with 20 μM azaserine or 20 mM HBP for 48 h. Relative viability of glioma cells detected
  by MTT assay. (*P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001; NS: not significant).
  GDNF, glial-derived neurotrophic factor; RET, rearranged during transfection; SREBP-1,
  sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; HBP, N-acetylglucosamine; p-, phosphorylated;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.'
