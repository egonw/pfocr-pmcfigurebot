caption: Landscape of lymphocytes and innate lymphoid cells in breast cancer liver
  and brain metastases. a) t‐SNE plot of the T cell and NK cell landscape colored
  by subcluster. b) Feature plots showing the normalized expression of canonical marker
  genes in each T cell and NK cell subcluster. c) t‐SNE plot of the B cell landscape
  colored by subcluster. d) Feature plots showing the normalized expression of canonical
  marker genes in each B cell subcluster. e) Dot plot showing the expression level
  of canonical marker genes across all lymphocyte and innate lymphoid cell subtypes.
  f) Heatmap showing the gene set score of each T cell and NK cell according to GSVA.
  Gene sets included MHC molecules, T cell cytotoxicity, T cell exhaustion, inflammatory
  pathway, regulatory cytokines, and immune checkpoint pathway sets. g) Heatmap showing
  the expression of core genes in each gene set. h) The cytotoxicity and dysfunction
  of each T cell and NK cell cluster were analyzed and quantified based on gene signature
  scores. i) Exhaustion scores of CD8_T_cells_c1_GZMK and CD8_T_cells_c2_ZNF683 in
  liver and brain metastases of breast cancer. j,k) The potential biological functions
  and relevant signaling pathways of T, B, and NK cell subclusters were evaluated
  by GO and KEGG analyses. l) Monocle pseudotime trajectory analysis of CD8+ T cells
  (CD8_T_cells_c1_GZMK, CD8_T_cells_c2_ZNF683, CD8_T_cells_c3_KLRB1, and CD8_T_cells_c4_IFIT3)
  with highly variable gene expression. l) Monocle pseudotime trajectory analysis
  of B cells (Pre‐B_cells_VPREB3, Naive_B_cells_TCL1A, Mature_B_cells_MS4A1, and Plasma_cells_MZB1)
  with highly variable gene expression. o) Violin plot showing the expression level
  of immune checkpoint genes in four CD8+ T cell subclusters. o) Dot plot showing
  the expression level of immune checkpoint genes in each lymphocyte and innate lymphoid
  cell subcluster. p) Feature plots showing the normalized expression of immune checkpoint
  genes in lymphocytes and innate lymphoid cells.
