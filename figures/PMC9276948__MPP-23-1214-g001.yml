caption: MoPtc1 and MoPtc2 play a regulatory role in cell wall integrity. (a) Light
  microscopic examination of protoplast release following 45 min treatment with cell
  wall‐degrading enzymes at 30°C. (b) Protoplast release assay. Asterisks indicate
  significant differences between ∆Moptc1, ∆Moptc2, ∆Moptc1∆Moptc2 double mutants,
  and the wild‐type strain Guy11 at p < 0.01. (c) Hyphal diameter of strains examined
  7 days after incubation on complete medium agar plates with the cell wall‐perturbing
  agent Congo Red (CR). (d) Phosphorylation of MoMps1 in ∆Moptc1, ∆Moptc2, and ∆Moptc1∆Moptc2
  mutants. Western blots were performed with total proteins from hyphae of Guy11,
  ∆Moptc1, ∆Moptc2, and ∆Moptc1∆Moptc2 mutants. The signal corresponding to phosphorylated
  MoMps1 was detected by binding of the antiphospho‐p44/42 antibody with the p42/44
  antibody as a control
