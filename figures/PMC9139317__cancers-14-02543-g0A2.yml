caption: Association between KYNU and tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites and
  KEAP1 mutation status in LUAD cell lines. (A) mRNA expression of KYNU in LUAD cell
  lines stratified by KEAP1 mutational status. Gene expression was derived from the
  Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database and overlapped with cell lines for
  which proteomic data was available. (B) Heatmap depicting Spearman correlation coefficients
  between CCLE-derived mRNA expression of KYNU and associated tryptophan-kynurenine
  pathway-related enzymes among LUAD cell lines. (C) Heatmap representing protein
  expression of NRF2-downstream targets including those detected proteins that comprise
  the consensus panel described by Best et al. [] among 47 LUAD cell lines. Columns
  are ranked (lowest to highest) by KYNU protein expression. (D) Scatter plot illustrating
  the association between CCLE-derived KYNU mRNA expression and a 10-gene NRF2 activation
  consensus signature described by Best et al. [] among LUAD cell lines. A regression
  line and associated 95% confidence intervals is shown.
