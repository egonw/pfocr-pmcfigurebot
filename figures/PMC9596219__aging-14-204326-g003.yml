caption: Increased DAZAP1 is conducive to tumor growth in MM xenograft model in vivo.
  (A) Photographic images of tumor burden mice were captured on day 26. (B) Subcutaneous
  tumors were gathered on the 26th day post grafting. (C) Growth curve of transplanted
  tumors. (D) Quantification of tumors weight from dissected tumors. All data are
  displayed as mean Â± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
