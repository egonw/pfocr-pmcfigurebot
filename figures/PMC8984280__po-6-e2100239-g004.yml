caption: Outcome-related gene and mutational signatures of HIPEC responders. (A) Hierarchical
  clustered analysis of significantly changed genes in tumor samples of 15 patients.
  Responders were categorized into good responders (PFS > 12 months) and poor responders
  (PFS < 12 months). (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicting PFS of good versus
  poor responders. (C) Kegg pathway gene set enrichment analysis from tumors of HIPEC
  responders demonstrate the top significantly upregulated and downregulated pathways
  (FDR < 0.05). Several immune-related pathways are upregulated in good responders,
  most prominently TNFα signaling via NFκB, while metabolic pathways are downregulated.
  (D) Oncoplot of the top 20 mutated genes. The upper bar plot indicates the number
  of intergenic somatic variants per patient while the right bar plot shows the number
  of variants per gene. The CADD score is shown on the left. The mutation types, histology
  types, and response to HIPEC are noted below the oncoplot. CADD, combined annotation
  dependent depletion; FDR, false discovery rate; HIPEC, hyperthermic intraperitoneal
  chemotherapy; HR, hazard ratio; NES, normalized enrichment score; NFκB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; PFS, progression-free survival; q. val., q value; TMB, tumor mutational
  burden; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α.
