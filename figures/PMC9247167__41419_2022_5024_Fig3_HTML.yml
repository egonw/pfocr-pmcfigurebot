figure_title: Metabolite analysis upon Gal-1 manipulation in GSC
caption: A Biolog’s MitoPlates S1 (14105, Biolog) study was performed as per the manufacturer’s
  instruction. The data obtained from SV and shGal-1 treatment from both GSC20 and
  GSC33 were presented as a bar graph. B Evaluation of the metabolic profile in GSC20
  and GSC33 using GC/MS analysis. The fold changes of different endogenous metabolites
  in SV and shGal-1 in GSC20 and GSC33 cells were plotted in a heatmap. C KEGG pathway
  fold enrichment analysis of all different endogenous metabolites.
