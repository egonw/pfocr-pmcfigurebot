caption: Metabolic pathways differentially affected by the sex of the fetus carried
  to term in plasma samples collected on day 0 (A), day 7 (B), and day 7/day 0 ratio
  (C) from all recipients transferred with an embryo. The metabolome view shows all
  matched pathways in accordance with the P values from the pathway enrichment analysis
  and pathway impact values (dot size) from the pathway topology analysis.
article_title: The recipient metabolome explains the asymmetric ovarian impact on
  fetal sex development after embryo transfer in cattle.
