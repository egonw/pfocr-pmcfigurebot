caption: Canonical Pathway analysis in the “OHT + DREADD” vs. “OHT” dataset of the
  RGC transcriptome. (a) Overarching categories to which the altered canonical pathways
  belong. (b) List of the altered signaling pathways, relevant to the biological question
  (FDR ≤ 0.1, −log (p-value) ≥ 1.30, Fisher’s exact test). A list of all significantly
  altered canonical pathways is provided in . IPA predictions are algorithm- (based
  on z-score, filled bars) or user-defined (striped bars). Pathways that are predicted
  to be upregulated are shown in orange, those predicted downregulated in blue. A
  grey bar indicates that no prediction could be made.
