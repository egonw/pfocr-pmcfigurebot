caption: RGS2 inhibits Gαq-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in uveal melanoma cells.A,
  schematic describing the signaling pathway leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation downstream
  of Gαq. B, the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (Tram) inhibits 92.1 cell growth. Induction
  of RGS2-HA with Dox enhances the effect of Tram only at low concentrations (≤1 nM;
  and see ). Result of three independent experiments with five technical replicates
  in each. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test for pairwise
  comparisons. Representative Western blot (C) and quantification of five independent
  experiments (D) demonstrating that both RGS2-HA induction and siRNA-mediated Gαq
  knockdown results in significantly reduced levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 92.1 cells.
  E, protein levels of total ERK1/2 are unaffected by either Dox or Gαq siRNA. F,
  efficiency of siRNA-mediated Gαq knockdown in 92.1 cells was ∼70%. Representative
  Western blot (G) and quantification of three independent experiments (H) demonstrating
  that both RGS2-HA induction and siRNA-mediated Gαq knockdown results in significantly
  reduced levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Mel-202 cells. I, protein levels of
  total ERK1/2 are unaffected by either Dox or Gαq siRNA. J, efficiency of siRNA-mediated
  Gαq knockdown in Mel-202 cells was ∼90%. The effect of RGS2 on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  is lost when Gαq was concurrently knocked down in both 92.1 and Mel-202 cells. ∗p <
  0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Dox, doxycycline; ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling.
