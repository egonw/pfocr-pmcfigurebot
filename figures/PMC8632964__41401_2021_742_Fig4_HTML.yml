figure_title: EF decreases proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated
  macrophages
caption: a–c RAW264.7 cells were treated with EF at the indicated concentrations for
  0.5 h, followed by challenge with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated,
  and the mRNA levels of TNF-α (a), IL-1β (b), and IL-6 (c) were then quantified by
  real-time PCR. d–f BMDMs were also pretreated with EF at 0, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM
  for 0.5 h and then challenged with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 4 h, and the mRNA levels
  of TNF-α (d), IL-1β (e), and IL-6 (f) were quantified by real-time PCR. The experiments
  were independently repeated at least three times. Values represent the mean ± SEM.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
