caption: 'Drug D mitigates pancreatic necrosis and systemic inflammation with GSDMD
  down-accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum in acute pancreatitis. (a) The experimental
  schedule. (b–d) The levels of amylase (b), lipase (c) and LDH (d) in serum were
  detected (n = 3). (e) The levels of IL-1β in pancreas tissues were detected (n =
  3). (f) The general morphology of the pancreas was observed. (gi–giv) Representative
  H&E images and histopathological scores of the pancreas in L-arginine-acute pancreatitis
  (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (hi,hii) The expressions of p-IRE1α in pancreas tissues
  were analyzed by Western blot (n = 4). (ii,iii) Representative immunofluorescence
  staining of GSDMD (red), CALNEXIN (green) and DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded of pancreas tissues and pearson’s correlation coefficient of GSDMD
  and CALNEXIN (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (ji,jii) Representative immunofluorescence
  staining of GSDMD (red), CALNEXIN (green) and DAPI (dark blue) in isolated primary
  acinar cells from mice and pearson’s correlation coefficient of GSDMD and CALNEXIN
  (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (k) The H&E staining of control groups and 10 mg/kg
  Drug D groups (n = 5), Scale bars, 50 μm. All values were shown as the mean ± SEM.
  #p < 0.05 compared with control group, Δp < 0.05, ΔΔp < 0.01, ΔΔΔp < 0.001, ΔΔΔΔp
  < 0.0001 compared with Drug D (5 mg/kg) group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001, **** p < 0.0001, compared with mice acute pancreatitis model groups. Unpaired
  Student’s t-tests were used in (b–e,gii–giv,hii,iii,jii).'
