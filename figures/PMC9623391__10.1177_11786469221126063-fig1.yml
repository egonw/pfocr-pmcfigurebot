caption: 'The kynurenine pathway. This schematic illustrates tryptophan (Trp) metabolism
  though the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), one of the rate-limiting
  enzymes of the kynurenine pathway is up-regulated by elevated glucocorticoids, glucagon
  and Trp. The kynurenine pathway is also activated under inflammatory conditions.
  Inflammatory mediators also activate the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway. Indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the rate-limiting
  enzymes of the kynurenine and BH4 pathways, respectively are activated in the presence
  of inflammatory mediators. Activation of the BH4 pathway results in the accumulation
  of the metabolite neopterin, an established sensitive biomarker for inflammatory
  activation and a surrogate for IDO activation. Once activated, the kynurenine pathway
  transforms the amino acid Trp into a series of intermediates through specific enzymes
  catalyzing each reaction in various cells/tissues. The metabolites that were measured
  in the present study are highlighted in gray (Adapted and redrawn from Staats Pires
  et al).Abbreviations: 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; 3-HAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic
