caption: 'LncRNA PART1 regulated miR-17-5p/SOCS6 to inactivate STAT3 signaling pathway
  A: SOCS6 mRNA expression in OSCC cells and HOECs were analyzed using RT-qPCR. B:
  TargetScan provided binding sites between miR-17-5p and SOCS6. C: Luciferase reporter
  test. D–F: Western blot assays were performed to measure the changes in SOCS6 protein
  expression. G. SOCS6 mRNA expression in SCC9 and CAL27 cells with PART1 overexpression
  and additional upregulation of miR-17-5p. H–J: Phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT3 proteins
  were validated by western blot. *p =< 0.032, **p =< 0.0021, ***p =< 0.0002, and
  ****p < 0.0001.'
