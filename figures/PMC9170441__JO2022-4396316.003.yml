caption: Silvestrol decreases the proliferative potential of the human GBM cells.
  (a) The molecular structure of silvestrol. (b, c) After being exposed to different
  concentration of silvestrol (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nmol/L)
  for 24 or 48 hours, the viability of U251 and U87 cells was assessed using the MTT
  assay. The IC50 values of silvestrol for U251 and U87 cells were found to be 22.883 nmol/L
  and 13.152 nmol/L (24 hours). (d, e) We used Ki67 to evaluate the proliferation
  ability of GBM cells by immunofluorescence. The proliferative capacity of GBM cells
  decreased significantly with silvestrol treatment, but it was rescued by hypoxia.
  (f, g) Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki67 in U251 and U87 cells treated with silvestrol
  and hypoxia.
