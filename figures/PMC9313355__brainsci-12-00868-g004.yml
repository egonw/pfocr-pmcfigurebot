caption: 'BCP activates the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway in OGD/R-injured HT-22 cells. (A–C)
  Representative Western blots showing protein levels of Pink1 and Parkin2. Protein
  levels were normalized to β-actin. (D,E) Double-immunofluorescence staining for
  VDAC1 and Parkin2 in HT-22 cells at 24 h after reperfusion. VDAC1 (red) and Parkin2
  (green) double-stained cells (yellow) indicate mitophagy. (Scale bar = 50 μm, 400×
  magnification). (n = 3; ** p < 0.01 OGD/R group vs. control group; ## p < 0.01 OGD/R
  + BCP group vs. OGD/R group).'
