caption: Immunofluorescent (IF) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on cerebral
  cortex and hippocampus in different groups. (A and B) IF staining for M1 and M2
  cells in CA1 region of the hippocampus, respectively. (C) IHC staining for M1 and
  M2 cells in DG region of the hippocampus. Statistics of co‐staining of iba‐1 and
  iNOS (FKA = 25, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 25, vs. KA) (D) as well as iba‐1 and Arg‐1 (FKA+MEL = 18.25,
  vs. KA) (E) in CA1 and Statistics of Arg‐1 (FKA = 2.588, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 8.059,
  vs. KA) (F) as well as iNOS (FKA = 3.250, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 1.477, vs. KA) (G)
  in DG regions in different groups. Protein levels in RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.
  (H) Western blot (WB) tests for RhoA, p‐MYPT1, t‐MYPT1, p‐MLCK, and t‐MLCK proteins.
  Statistics for p‐MYPT1/t‐MYPT1 ratio (I) (FKA = 18.26, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 2.303,
  vs. KA), p‐MLCK/t‐MLCK ratio (J) (FKA = 2.093, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 1.158, vs. KA)
  and RhoA/GAPDH ratio (K) (FKA = 6.234, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 59.41, vs. KA) expressions
  in different groups; (L) WB tests for ROCK1 and ROCK2 proteins. Statistics for ROCK1/GAPDH
  ratio (M) and ROCK2/GAPDH ratio (N) (FKA = 1.658, vs. CON; FKA+MEL = 7.650, vs.
  KA) in different groups. (*p < .05; **p < .01, ***p < .001).
