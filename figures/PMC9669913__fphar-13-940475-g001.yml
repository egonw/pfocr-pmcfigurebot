caption: 'Eupatilin effects on proliferation and cytotoxicity of NP cells. (A) Chemical
  structure of eupatilin. (B) Effect of 24-h eupatilin 100 µM on NP cytotoxicity was
  determined by CCK-8. The 96-well plates contain 10,000 NP cells per well (n = 4).
  (C–F) Effects of eupatilin on the proliferation of NP cells in 24, 48, 72, and 96 h
  in the concentration range of 100 µM were determined by CCK-8 assay. The 96-well
  plates contain 2,000 NP cells per well. All the aforementioned data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. n = 4, compared with the control group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
  < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001; ns: no statistically significant difference.'
