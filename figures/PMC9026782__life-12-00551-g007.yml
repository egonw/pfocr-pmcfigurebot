caption: Effect of APT1 in endothelium-derived hBPs on macrophages. (A), The number
  and morphology of BPs under electron microscopy in normal group and LPC-stimulation
  group, where the scale bars were 500 nm; (B), confocal observation fluorescently
  labeled BPs are phagocytosed by macrophages; (C), expression of APT1 protein in
  BPs after LPC stimulation; (D), the RNA expression of APT1 and miR-138 in BPs after
  LPC stimulation. The results were all shown by mean Â± standard deviation; the above
  experiments were repeated three times; * represents p < 0.05.
