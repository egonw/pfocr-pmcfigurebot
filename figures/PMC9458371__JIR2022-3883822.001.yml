caption: Schematic illustration of the study design. High-throughput data of monkeypox-infected
  7-hours of Macaca mulatta kidney epithelial (MK2) cells and monkeypox-infected 6-hours
  of human immortal epithelial cancer (HeLa) cells were both acquired from the GEO
  database. The top 5% of differentially expressed genes in the two monkeypox-infected
  models were determined through a Venn diagram analysis. Results of pathway analyses
  and functional interpretations were analyzed using DAVID, GO, STRING, and MetaCore.
