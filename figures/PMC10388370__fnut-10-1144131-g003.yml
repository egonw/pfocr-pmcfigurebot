caption: Venn diagram for the HDP-associated signal/metabolites (A) and pathways (B)
  in women within different BMI categories. (A) The HDP-associated signals (the first
  number) and metabolites (the second number) determined in women of (A) all three
  BMI categories, (B) overweight and normal weight, (C) normal weight and obese, (D)
  overweight and obese, (E) normal weight only, (F) overweight only, and (G) obese
  only. The association was determined by logistic regression models (p < 0.05) adjusting
  for gravidity and maternal age, whether they smoked more than 100 cigarettes in
  their lifetime, and gestational week when serum samples and BMI were obtained. Signals
  and the identified (or annotated) metabolites corresponding to (A) were summarized
  in . (B) The enriched HDP-associated pathway for women of (A) all three BMI categories,
  (B) overweight and normal weight, (C) normal weight and obese, (D) overweight and
  obese, (E) normal weight only, (F) overweight only, and (G) obese only. The list
  of pathways corresponding to (B) was summarized in . No covariates were adjusted
  for data used for pathway enrichment.
