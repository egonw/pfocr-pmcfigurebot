caption: Proposed signaling pathway between insulin and hypothalamic astrocytes in
  response to exogenous glutamate signaling. The steps are explained in the text.
  Briefly, intravenous exogenous glutamate acts on glutamate receptors in pancreatic
  cells, increasing insulin secretion, which in turn enters the brain and binds to
  its receptor in hypothalamic astrocytes, generating an increase in GnRH and FSH
  and LH release, improving the ovarian activity in yearling goats during the anestrous
  season.
