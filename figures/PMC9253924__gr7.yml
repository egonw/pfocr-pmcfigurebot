caption: (A&B) The regulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling (Socs2 and Socs3)
  was observed at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W in injury groups compared to VC group. (C, D&E)
  The regulation of Toll-like receptors (Tlr4 and Tlr9) and its adapter molecule (Myd88)
  was observed in injury groups at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared to VC groups respectively.
  The graphical data presented in mean ± S.D. and significant level was considered
  as p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001.
