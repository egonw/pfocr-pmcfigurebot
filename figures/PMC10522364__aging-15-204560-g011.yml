caption: Validation of NRP1’s regulation of tumor autophagy and proliferative capacity
  in vitro. (A) QPCR was used to detect NRP1 gene expression in gastric cancer cell
  lines. (B) western blot analysis. (C, D) EdU assay and cell immunofluorescence were
  used to detect the effect of NRP1 knockout on cell proliferation. (E) Autophagy
  assay to detect the effect of NRP1 knockdown on autophagy. (F) The effect of NRP1
  knockdown on autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy. (*P< 0.05;
  **P< 0.01; ***P< 0.001;****P< 0.0001).
