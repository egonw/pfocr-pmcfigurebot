caption: HBO1-mediated Kbz is associated with diverse cellular processes(A) Volcano
  map shows the dynamics of Kbz sites in response to HBO1 overexpression. Quantitative
  proteomic analysis was performed with three biological replicates in response to
  HBO1 overexpression in 293T cells. When log2 (overexpression/control) > 1 and p < 0.05,
  the quantified Kbz sites were considered significantly upregulated.(B) Dynamics
  of histone Kbz sites in response to HBO1 overexpression. Histograms show significantly
  upregulated core histone sites. Data are represented as mean ±SEM.(C) Motifs of
  the residues around the Kbz sites identified in mammalian cells (left) and reported
  in S. cerevisiae (right), respectively.(D–F) (D) GO-MF term GSEA, (E) GO-BP term
  enrichment, and (F) KEGG pathway analysis of the proteins bearing HBO1-targeted
  Kbz sites.
