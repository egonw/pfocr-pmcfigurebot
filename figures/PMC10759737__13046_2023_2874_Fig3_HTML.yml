caption: The RPTOR-promoted BM of NSCLC through the SPHK2/S1P/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  A-D Western blotting showed that the exogenous RRTOR boosted the expression of proteins
  of the ceramide metabolism pathway, including SPHK2, S1PR1 and p-STAT3 (ser705).
  Eâ€“H The SPHK2 inhibitor, ABC294640, reversed the activation of the SPHK2/S1P/STAT3
  signaling pathway and the RPTOR overexpression-increased cell invasiveness and permeability
  of BBB, while the S1P inhibitor, fingolimod hydrochloride, reduced the expression
  of S1P1 protein, without affecting the expression of YY1 and SPHK2
article_title: RPTOR blockade suppresses brain metastases of NSCLC by interfering
  the ceramide metabolism via hijacking YY1 binding.
