figure_title: Targeting autophagy for cancer therapy
caption: The autophagy pathway is a major contributor to tumour cell survival and
  as a result is considered a target for cancer therapy. To date, only a small number
  of autophagy modulators have been described, with the majority of studies focused
  on inhibition of the lysosomal degradation stage of autophagy, using agents such
  as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or the lysosomal autophagy inhibitor Lys05. Additional
  inhibitors targeting other stages of the process such as autophagosomal membrane
  elongation and closure as well as lysosomal fusion are currently largely lacking.
  Inhibitors against UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and VPS34, which act on the initiation
  stage of autophagy, are showing promise in preclinical studies–. Alternatively,
  autophagy can be targeted in cancer backgrounds that are particularly dependent
  on autophagy owing to oncogenic activation of signalling pathways. For example,
  the RAS–mitogen-associated kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated in a large proportion
  of cancers through overexpression or mutation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  and/or mutation of the downstream effectors RAS and RAF. Inhibitors of this pathway
  were designed to promote cell death in cases in which the pathway was activated.
  It was found that inhibition of RAS signalling pathway components causes activation
  of the kinase LKB1, resulting in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) and leading to activation of autophagy, which in turn represses cell death
  and promotes cell survival–. This has motivated interest in combining autophagy
  inhibitors with RAS–MAPK pathway inhibitors. Given the opposing roles of autophagy
  in cancer, a few studies have also indicated that promotion of autophagy may be
  beneficial for cancer therapy. For example, combination of the tricyclic antidepressant
  imipramine with the purinergic receptor inhibitor ticlopidine was found to cause
  excessive autophagy and cell death dependent on autophagy. The combination showed
  promising results in preclinical models of glioma. ACR, autophagy cargo receptor;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LC3-II, lipidated microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ULK1i,
