figure_title: SAHA inhibits WNT5A-mediated ESCC cell migration and invasion
caption: 'A Representative western blots showing the levels of FLAG-WNT5A, HDAC7,
  SNAIL, E-cadherin, and vimentin in WNT5A-overexpressing EC109 and KYSE450 cells
  after treatment with SAHA for 48 h. β-actin was used as an internal control. B,
  C Representative images and statistical analysis of wound healing assays and Transwell
  migration/invasion assays using WNT5A-overexpressing ESCC cells after treatment
  with SAHA (1.25 μM) for 48 h. The migratory ability in wound healing assays was
  expressed as the mean scratch area. The initial scratch area (0 h) was set to 100%.
  *P < 0.05 compared with the LV-Control group, #P < 0.05 compared with the LV-Control + SAHA
  group, and &P < 0.05 compared with the LV-WNT5A group. LV lentivirus.'
