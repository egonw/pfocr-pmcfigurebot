caption: The inhibition of Kremen2 is involved in several cancer-related signaling
  pathways. A Hierarchical clustered heatmap displaying the differentially expressed
  genes. B The KEGG pathway analysis reveals significantly enriched signaling pathways
  in the differentially expressed genes. C GO biological processes show the Z-score
  normalized expression of the differentially expressed genes in H1703 cells after
  Kremen2-knockdown according to the RNA-seq data, which were mainly enriched in biological
  processes, such as cell proliferation and migration. D, E Protein levels of Wnt
  and PI3K/AKT signaling as indicated in the H1703 cell line with Kremen2 knockdown
  were detected by western blot. Fâ€“H Effects of Kremen2 level on the expression of
  proteins associated with cell proliferation and the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway
  in A549 and H1703 cells
