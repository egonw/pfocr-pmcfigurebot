caption: The related genes are marked in a blue box. The GSH pathway contains GSH
  synthesis (GCLC, trans-sulfuration pathway), Glu exporter (System Xc-), and GSH
  reduction (GPX4). The mevalonate pathway is mainly involved in FSP1-mediated CoQ
  reduction. BH4 pathway contains GCH1-mediated BH2 synthesis and DHFR-stimulated
  conversion of BH2 to BH4. DHODH is functional in the mitochondrion.
