caption: Evasion of PRRsmediated signaling pathways by EV71. By means of the non-structural
  proteins 2A, 2C, and 3C, EV targets the PRRs signaling pathway. 2A degrades IFNAR1
  and cleaves MAVS and MDA5. RIG-1 and MAVS complex is cleavedby 3C which also inactivates
  TRIF. The activation of RIG-1 bymir-526a is inhibited by 3C and by promoting the
  expression of miR-146a.
