caption: Changes in HER3 expression in panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines treated
  with lapatinib. Western blot of HER2+ breast cancer panel treated for 48h with the
  HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib (L) shows increase in HER3 expression relative
  to vehicle (V) which is not conserved across cell lines, consistent with HER3 upregulation
  being a mechanism of resistance in some but not all HER2+ tumors (A, B). In cell
  lines that increase HER3 expression, lapatinib reduces but does not completely stop
  downstream growth pathway signaling (A). Relative survival of HER2+ cells treated
  with 200 Î¼M lapatinib for 5 days (C) show that both sensitive cell lines (SKBR-3,
  BT-474) [] and resistant cell lines (MD-MBA-453) [] demonstrate increase in HER3
  expression when compared to results of panel A. All experiments conducted in triplicate.
