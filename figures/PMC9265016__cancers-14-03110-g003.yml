caption: RORγ antagonists stimulate cholesterol efflux gene expression in mCRPC cells.
  (a) Heat map of mRNA expression changes in 10 cholesterol efflux genes, as detected
  by RNA-seq in 22Rv1 cells treated with indicated concentrations of XY018 for 48
  h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO). (b) Venn diagram of the number of genes with expression
  significantly upregulated (1.3-fold), as detected by RNA-seq of 22Rv1 and C4-2B
  cells treated with 5 µM of XY018 for 48 h (top). Gene ontology analysis of the 671
  genes with expression upregulated in both 22Rv1 and C4-2B cells treated with XY018
  as shown in the top part (bottom). (c) Heat map of mRNA expression changes in 7
  cholesterol efflux genes, as measured by qRT-PCR in 22Rv1 and C4-2B cells treated
  with 5 µM of XY018 for 48 h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO), n = 3. (d,e) Immunoblotting
  of proteins involved in cholesterol efflux pathway in 22Rv1 (d) and C4-2B (e) cells
  treated with indicated concentrations of XY018 for 72 h.
