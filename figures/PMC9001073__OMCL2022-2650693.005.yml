caption: 'CRX-527 treatment reversed ISO neuroprotection in diabetic CIRI. (a) Left,
  TTC-stained slices from the ISO(+) sham vehicle, ISO(+) sham CRX-527, ISO(+) MCAO
  vehicle, and ISO(+) MCAO CRX-527 groups in DM mice. Right, the bar graph shows the
  ipsilateral infarct size of each group (n = 3 − 6 in each group). (b) The bar graph
  shows the neurological scores (n = 3 − 10 in each group). (c) Left, western blot
  image of TLR4 and MyD88 (n = 3 in each group). Middle and right, bar graphs showing
  TLR4 (middle) and MyD88 (right) expression (n = 5 in each group). (d) Top, western
  blot image of p-NF-κB p65, NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins (n = 3 in each group).
  Middle, bar graphs showing p-NF-κB p65 (left) and NLRP3 (right) expression (n =
  5 in each group). Bottom, bar graphs showing caspase-1 (left, n = 6 in each group)
  and IL-1β (right, n = 5 in each group) expression. (e) Top, western blot image of
  autophagy-related proteins (n = 3 in each group). Middle, the expression of LC3B
  (left) and p62 (right). Bottom, the expression of Beclin-1 (n = 5 in each group).
  (f) Representative immunofluorescence images that microglia expressed TLR4 (scale
  bar: 100 μm, magnification: 400x). (g) Representative immunofluorescence images
  that microglia expressed LC3B (scale bar: 100 μm, magnification: 400x). ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
