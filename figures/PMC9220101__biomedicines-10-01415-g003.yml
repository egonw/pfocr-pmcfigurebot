caption: 'The graphic summary of the pathogenesis of PAH and the potential therapeutic
  targets in treating PAH. Three major cellular signaling pathways have been conventionally
  identified for targeted therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): (1) The
  endothelin pathway, (2) nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine, the monophosphate (cGMP)
  pathway, and (3) the prostacyclin pathway. In combination, abnormalities in these
  pathways contribute to PAH pathogenesis caused by vascular remodeling as a result
  of the proliferation and migration of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs).
  Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib, Nilotinib) are used to reduce the
  effect of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), which are the predominant
  triggers of unregulated PASMCs’ proliferation and migration, leading to vascular
  remodeling. 17-AAG, a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-inhibitor, and gamitrinib, a
  mitochondrial matrix inhibitor, can be used to downregulate HSP90, thereby reducing
  cell proliferation. Saquinavir and glycyrrhizn can also decrease cell proliferation
  and migration in PASMCs by inhibiting the high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1). Pharmacological
  induction of the p53 expression/activity by using a p53 stabilizing agent, CP-31398,
  can also counteract the effect of p53 silencing or deficiency. Apabetalone, the
  orally available bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitor, blocks the
  binding between acetylation on chromatin histones and BET proteins, which normalizes
  hemodynamics parameters and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. Suppressing PI3K/AKT
  by using the small molecular inhibitor, LY294002, may also reverse hypoxia-induced
  anti-apoptotic PASMCs’ proliferation, as well as inhibit the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR), one of the major downstream effectors of the PI3K/AKT pathway,
  via rapamycin. Dichloroacetate (DCA) and the non-coding micro-RNA, miR125a-5p, targeting
  hexokinase 2, can decrease glycolysis while increasing mitochondrial respiration.'
