caption: TREM2 knockdown involved in immune escape of thyroid cancer cells via NF-κB
  pathway. (a, b) The expression of IκB-α, p-IκB-α, NF-κBp65, and p-NF-κBp65 in SW579
  and KTC-1 cells was detected by western blot. (c, d) Detection of p-NF-κBp65, p-IκB-α,
  and TREM2 levels after blocking the expression of NF-κB protein using different
  concentrations of PDTC. ∗P < 0.05 vs. control.
