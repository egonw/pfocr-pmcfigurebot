caption: PDT can cause death by the localization of photosensitizer to different organelles.
  Photosensitizers located in various subcellular location induces cell death through
  different mechanisms. Normally, photosensitizers are targeted at the plasma membrane,
  Golgi body, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria to cause cell death.
  Generation of singlet oxygen via photodynamic therapy in the plasma membrane causes
  cell death through the HOCl signaling pathway () or through disruption of the plasma
  membrane, which causes cell swelling and rupture (). In the Golgi body, singlet
  oxygen plays a role upstream of mitochondria to cause mitochondria-dependent cell
  death. Disruption of the lysosome by singlet oxygen causes increased mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeability (), while photodynamic activities in the ER cause misfolding
  of protein, which triggers unfold protein response (URP), leading to activation
  of caspase-3 ().
