figure_title: VPS34 is part of an autoregulated cell‐intrinsic pathway that controls
  neuronal network activity via Calpain 2, p25 and Cdk5
caption: 'Activity‐dependent polyspiking of population spikes (PS) during 1 Hz stimulation
  is reduced by VPS34IN1 and facilitated by Roscovitine compared to DMSO‐treated control
  slices. Top, representative traces of the 1st and 30th stimulus responses with polyspikes
  indicated by arrows. N = 12 slices per condition from 12 mice.Quantification of
  polyspiking amplitudes in response to the 30th stimulus in the presence of DMSO,
  VPS34IN1, or Roscovitine. Polyspiking amplitudes are increased by Roscovitine and
  reduced by VPS34IN1. N = 12 slices per condition from 12 mice; One‐way ANOVA.The
  relative changes in the PS and polyspike areas (i.e., the area indicated in blue
  in Fig ) in the presence of picrotoxin (50 µM) and a subsequent treatment with DMSO
  or VPS34IN1 (10 µM). VPS34IN1 significantly reduced the PS and polyspike area compared
  to DMSO. N = 6 slices per condition from 6 mice.Mean area of PS and polyspikes in
  picrotoxin‐treated slices 40 min postapplication of DMSO or VPS34IN1. N ≥ 6 slices
  per condition from ≥ 6 mice; Student’s t‐test.A working‐model for the feedback regulation
  of synaptic activity. Prolonged neuronal excitation downregulates VSP34‐mediated
  synthesis of endosomal PI(3)P. PI(3)P depletion causes the activation of Calpain
  2 and Cdk5, resulting in repression of SV recycling, neurotransmission and kinetic
  impairment of SV endocytosis to limit SV re‐supply and downregulate neuronal network
  activity. Data information: Data presented as mean ± SEM in all panels; *P < 0.05;
  ***P < 0.001. Source data are available online for this figure.'
