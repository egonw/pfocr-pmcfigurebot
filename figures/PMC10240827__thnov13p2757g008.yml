caption: 'Upregulation of STAT1/HMGB1 in kidney tissues of CKD patients. The dataset
  GSE66494 deposited in GEO for kidney tissues from CKD patients and healthy donors
  was analyzed for gene transcription (A-C). Renal biopsies from non-CKD patient controls
  (n=3) and CKD patients (n=7) were assessed for the immunofluorescence staining (D-G).
  (A) Upregulation of HMGB1 in kidney tissues of CKD patients. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM. N: 8 healthy subjects and 54 CKD samples. * P <0.05 vs. the control
  group (Con). (B) Bubble graphs of the enriched gene expression pathways based on
  GO enrichment analysis. (C) Heat-map of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonging
  to the STAT/HMGB1 signaling pathway kidney tissues of CKD patients. (D) Representative
  immunofluorescence staining of HMGB1in renal biopsies from CKD patients. (E) Statistical
  analysis of the average fluorescence intensity of HMGB1. (F) Representative immunofluorescence
  staining of p65. (G) Statistical analysis of number of p65-positive cell nuclei
  in the area of the field. Scale bar = 50 μm. Quantitative data are expressed as
  mean ± SEM. N ≥ 3. * P <0.05 vs. the non-CKD group.'
