figure_title: COMMD10-deficient KCs display an altered transcriptional profile involved
  with stress response
caption: (A-C, E-H) MARS-RNAseq heat maps comparing between Commd10fl/fl and Clec4fΔCommd10
  KCs and displaying expression of genes involved with (A) KC core signature and (B)
  KC transcription factors. Significantly varied genes are marked red. (C) MoKC signature,
  (E) Translation and ribosomal biogenesis, (F) Ubiquitin system and proteasome machinery,
  (G) Mitochondrial respiratory chain, (H) Antigen processing and presentation. (D)
  Top canonical pathways uncovered by ingenuity pathway analysis. Analysis was performed
  on differentially expressed genes (≥1.5-fold change, p < 0.05) (n>3).
