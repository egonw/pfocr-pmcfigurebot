caption: 'Molecular mechanism of cancer: Schematic drawing of “Molecular Mechanism
  of Cancer” obtained by ingenuity canonical pathway analysis of PRELP application
  to WERI-RB1 cells. The majority of cancer-associated pathways were downregulated
  in PRELP-treated WERI-RB1 cells. Red = upregulated; green = downregulated; orange
  = predicted upregulation; blue = predicted downregulation.'
