caption: M. bovis inhibits multiple expression genes for cell growth and nutrient
  metabolism. (A) Heatmap showing the differences in the transcripts between the two
  samples, with the screening criteria of log2 Ratio of M. bovis infection/Control
  ≥1 or ≤1 and p-value ≤0.05. (B) GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis of down-regulated
  genes showed that the down-regulated genes after M. bovis infection are mainly involved
  in metabolic process and immune response. Enriched factors are presented as histogram
  and the gene counts are shown as line chart. (C) Selected genes differentially regulated
  involved in cell cycle, cell grown, insulin, PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways.
