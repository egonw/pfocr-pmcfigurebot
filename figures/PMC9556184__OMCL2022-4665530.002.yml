caption: Bioinformatics analysis for VDAC1 and its related genes expression. (a) Heatmap
  exhibited the expression of VDAC1 and its related genes. (b) The relative expression
  of VDAC1 in the control group and PD patients. Wilcoxon's test was performed to
  analyze the VDAC1 expression between control group and PD patients (∗P < 0.05, n =6).
  VDAC1 expression was significantly decreased in PD patients compared to control
  group. (c) VDAC1 correlated with genes in the calcium signaling pathway, apoptosis,
  and autophagy. (∗P < 0.05, n =6). Spearman's correlation between VDAC1 and all other
  genes was computed by R software (version 3.6.3). Significant correlations were
  chosen with P < 0.05 (FDR correction). Red lines linked genes that have negative
  correlations with VDAC1, and blue lines linked genes that have positive correlation
  with VDCA1. The positive correlation suggested that two genes have the same varying
  expression tendency. The negative correlation suggested that two genes have different
  varying expression tendency.
