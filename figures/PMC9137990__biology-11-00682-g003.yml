caption: 'Functional categorization of GGF2-altered genes. (a) Bar chart showing functions
  enriched in differentially expressed gene lists from GGF-2 treated versus untreated
  LV tissues, identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Functions are
  listed on the y-axis, and the x-axis indicates the number of differentially expressed
  genes in each category. Teal and orange represent low and high doses of GGF2, respectively.
  Enrichment p-value is indicated on each bar. (b) Pie chart showing top gene ontology
  categories for GGF-2 altered genes manually grouped into three generalized associative
  categories: development (blue), metabolic (red), and stress response (green). Uncharacterized
  and poorly characterized transcripts were excluded.'
