caption: Metabolic adaptation-linked cancer stemness and progression. Cancer cells
  may present distinct metabolic phenotypes (oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS, or
  Warburg) or biofunctions (tumorigenesis or metastasis) at certain reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) levels, depending on the circumstances and intrinsic responses. For
  example, at normal ROS levels, cancer cells of the OXPHOS phenotype depend on aerobic
  glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lipolysis for fueling tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)-coupled
  OXPHOS. This highly efficient usage of nutrients for ATP generation facilitates
  the survival, rather than the proliferation, of cancer cells when facing a shortage
  of these nutrients (A). On the other hand, cancer cells of the Warburg phenotype
  at normal ROS levels also depend on glycolysis primarily for supporting lactate
  production and TCA-coupled biosynthesis, rather than OXPHOS, such as the de novo
  synthesis of amino acids and fatty acids, which is known to facilitate proliferation
  of cancer cells (B). Cancer cells during metastasis and tumor initiation share similarly
  high ROS conditions and metabolic phenotypes. Extensive ROS blocks aerobic glycolysis,
  resulting in lactate accumulation (C,D) and perhaps pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  activation when proliferation is required in tumorigenesis (C). On the other hand,
  glutamine uptake and glutathione (GSH) generation are upregulated (C,D). In addition,
  TCA function is recovered by glutaminolysis and lipolysis when proliferation requires
  reactivation for tumorigenesis (C). PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; GSH, glutathione.
