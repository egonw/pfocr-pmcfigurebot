caption: 'SHCZF activated the SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway. (a–e) The relative mRNA
  and protein expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α in hepatic tissues was measured by qRT-PCR
  and Western blotting, respectively. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the normal group.
  #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.001 vs. the model group. ΔP < 0.05 and ΔΔΔP < 0.001 vs. the
  high-dose SHCZF group.'
