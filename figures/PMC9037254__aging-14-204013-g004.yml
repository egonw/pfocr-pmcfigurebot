caption: Protein expression under different conditions (A) Expression of Nrf2 and
  HO-1 in GC cells cultured under a hypoxic condition. The graphs show the quantified
  data of western blots. (B) Expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and HIF-1Î± in GC cells after
  they were transfected with siRNAs and cultured under a hypoxic condition. The graphs
  show the quantified data of western blot. (*P<0.05, **P<0.001).
