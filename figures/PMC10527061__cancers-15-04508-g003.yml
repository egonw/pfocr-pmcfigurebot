caption: 'ZFP64 activates Notch1 signaling pathways. (A,B) Notch1 signaling pathway
  related protein levels in GBC cells overexpressing ZFP64 (A) or knocking down ZFP64
  (B) were detected by Western blot assays. (C,D) Representative immunofluorescent
  staining images and statistical analysis of NICD in GBC-SD and NOZ cells overexpressing
  ZFP64 or knocking down ZFP64. NICD: green fluorescent; DAPI-stained nuclei: blue
  fluorescent. All data were assessed using unpaired Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA,
  as mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, See  for original western blots.'
