caption: 'On non-diabetic collagen, RAGE-associated cascade signal proteins in diabetic
  RKO fibroblasts did not differ from non-diabetic RKO fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts
  (P1) isolated from non-diabetic and diabetic RKO mice were cultured on collagen
  isolated from non-diabetic mice. Total protein was collected and used to evaluate
  the expression of AGE/RAGE pathway proteins involved with the signaling cascade
  and downstream outcomes: (A) α-SMA (42 kDa), (B) p-NF-κB (65 kDa), (C) SOD-2 (25
  kDa), (D) p-PKC-ζ (72 kDa), and (E) p-ERK1/2 (44 and 42 kDa, respectively). (F)
  Representative Western blot images for α-SMA, p-NF-κB, SOD-2, p-PKC-ζ, and p-ERK1/2
  are shown and are not displayed as continuous blots due to logistical constraints
  brought on by the number of treatment groups and genotypes. The original Western
  blot images are available at doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.13369535. Protein expression
  for α-SMA, p-NF-κB, SOD-2, and p-PKC-ζ was normalized to β-tubulin (55 kDa) and
  p-ERK1/2 was normalized to total ERK1/2 protein expression. Mean ± SEM are presented
  in the graphs (n = 6–9) and statistical differences were determined using a Student’s
  t-test.'
