caption: Docking and MM-GBSA analysis of rutin and DAPT with the gamma secretase catalytic
  site. (A) Interaction of DAPT with gamma secretase active site represented with
  hydrogen bond surface of receptor. (B) Interaction of rutin with gamma secretase
  active site represented with hydrogen bond surface of receptor. (C) Residual interaction
  of DAPT with the gamma secretase active site. (D) Residual interaction of rutin
  with the gamma secretase active site. (E) Plot of MM-GBSA binding energy estimation
  of the DAPT-gamma secretase complex represented with component energy terms. (F)
  Plot of MM-GBSA binding energy estimation of the rutin-gamma secretase complex represented
  with component energy terms. a—Total binding energy, b—Coulombic interaction energy,
  c—Covalent interaction energy, d—Hydrogen bond interaction energy, e—Lipophilic
  interaction energy, f—Pi-pi packing interaction energy, g—Generalized Born electrostatic
  solvation energy, and h—Van der Waal’s interaction energy.
