caption: In OC, m6A regulatory proteins contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis
  by interacting with various RNAs. METTL3 and METTL14 stimulate the progression of
  OC by promoting the expression levels of FZD10, CSF-1, EIF3C, AXL, RHPN-AS1, miR-125-5p,
  and TROAP. HOXA10 forms a loop with ALKBH5 and jointly activates the JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway by mediating JAK2 m6A methylation and promoting the OC resistance
  to cisplatin. The activated NF-ÎºB up-regulates ALKBH5 expression and increases m6A
  level and NANOG expression, contributing to ovarian carcinogenesis. FTO and ALKBH5
  stimulate/inhibit the progression of OC by affecting the expression levels of ATG5,
  ATG7, PDE1C, PDE4B, and FZD10.YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and IGF2BP1 stimulate/inhibit the progression
  of OC by affecting the expression of BMF, TRIM29, EIF3C, SRF, and UBA6. In addition,
  FBW7 and miR-145 inhibit the expression of YTHDF, leading to OC suppression
