caption: 'Transmembrane protein expression levels. (A) Cldn 4, (B) ZO-1, and (C) integrin
  β1 expression was measured after 24 h of toxin exposure to HCEC-1CT. Images show
  Cldn 4, ZO-1, and integrin β1 expression for the following incubation conditions:
  IL-1β, 10 μM AOH, 1 μM ATX-II, and the binary mixture (combi). Corrected cell fluorescence
  intensities (CTCFs) (bar graphs) were normalized to the IL-1β stimulus control and
  are expressed as means + SD of a minimum of three independent experiments, including
  at least six randomly chosen optical fields per condition. Significant differences
  were calculated by applying a two-sample t-test. Differences of incubation conditions
  compared to the IL-1β control are indicated by *(p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), and ***
  (p < 0.001), differences between incubation of a compound + CH-22 and the compound
  alone are highlighted with # (p < 0.05), and significant differences compared to
  solvent control are shown as § (p < 0.05).'
