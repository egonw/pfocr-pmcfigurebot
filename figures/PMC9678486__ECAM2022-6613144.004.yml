caption: The IVCM images of the anterior and posterior stromal layers under the cornea
  on the 35th day. Quiet stromal cells, a small number of globular immune cells, and
  nerve fibers (Con). A large number of globular immune cells as shown by the arrow
  and activated stromal layer cells with unclear borders and irregular sizes. Areas
  with irregular intercellular spaces were seen. A change in nerve width was seen
  with the decreasing nerve branch reflectivity (Scop). Disordered stromal cells and
  intermittently thinner nerve fibers with high tortuous (Scop + Sham). The morphology
  of the stromal layer cells was improved, the cells were slightly activated, and
  there was no obvious abnormality in nerve reflexes. This indicates that the signs
  of inflammation in the corneal stromal layer were significantly reduced (Scop + Acup).
  Quiet stromal cells and nerve fibers (Scop + Flu). The image size is 400 × 400 microns.
