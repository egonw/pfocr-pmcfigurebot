caption: B cell response development in COVID‐19. Primary infection with SARS‐CoV‐2
  results in a spectrum of disease severity with differing impacts on humoral response
  development. (Right) Mild COVID‐19 or vaccination results in a GC‐focused response,
  allowing normal accumulation of somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation, memory
  formation, and plasma cell development. The extent of LLPC development in GC‐focused
  COVID‐19 responses remains a critical open question with important implications
  in response longevity. (Left) Severe/critical COVID‐19 results in an extrafollicular
  (EF)‐biased response with the rapid development of low‐mutation effector B cells
  (DN2) and plasmablasts. While the neutralizing capability of these populations has
  been confirmed, the impact of EF‐biased responses on memory formation, plasma cell
  development, and bone marrow engraftment is less clear. Heavy arrows—dominant pathway;
  Light arrows—secondary pathway; Dotted arrows—unconfirmed pathway. GC, germinal
  center; aNav, activated naive B cells; DN2, double negative (i.e., IgD−CD27− B cells
  that also lack expression of CXCR5 and are involved in the EF response that is outside
  the GC but can still have T cell help); ASC, antibody‐secreting cell; SLPC, short‐lived
  plasma cell; LLPC, long‐lived plasma cell
