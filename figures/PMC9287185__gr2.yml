caption: Schematic representation of Ewing sarcoma growth via PKA/PP1/PPP1RA1 signalling
  The suggested method through which the PKA/PPP1R1A/PP1 pathway promotes ES pathogenesis
  is depicted in this diagram. EWS/FLI upregulates PPP1R1A, which is subsequently
  phosphorylated and activated by PKA, which inhibits PP1 and causes a rise in the
  phosphorylation level of numerous kinase/phosphatase substrates, finally leading
  to ES pathology (Adapted from Luo et al.).
