caption: Tunicamycin induced ER stress alters insulin signaling in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7
  cells were treated with either DMSO (Veh) or 10 mg/mL of tunicamycin (Tm) for 6
  h prior to a 15 min acute challenge with 250 nM of bovine insulin. Cells were used
  to measure the expression of ER stress and downstream insulin signaling pathway
  proteins by Western blotting (Panel A). In a separate experiment, cells were used
  to determine the uptake of 2-NBD glucose for 1 h in triplicate after the insulin
  challenge (Panel B). Cells were also used for the extraction of total RNA to measure
  the expression of various ER stress genes by qRT-PCR (Panels C–G). Unspliced (u)
  and spliced (s) forms of XBP1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Panel H). Values were
  plotted as mean ± SD. p values were calculated using Student’s t test. *, p < 0.05;
  ***, p < 0.001.
