caption: Neuron-like morphology after HDAC inhibitor treatment. SH-SY5Y cells were
  cultured with RA (10 μM), MS-275 (500 nM), or VPA (20 μM) and images were taken
  on the 1st and 7th days under a microscope. HDAC inhibitors (MS-275 and VPA) induced
  neuronal differentiation effectively compared to control and RA treatments. The
  scale bar represents 100 μm
article_title: Effects of HDAC inhibitors on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell differentiation
  into mature neurons via the Wnt signaling pathway.
