caption: 'Enrichment analysis of terpene biosynthesis pathway in D. catenatum growth.
  (a) GSEA for root vs. flower comparison. Enrichment scores reveal the expression
  levels of enriched genes. p value < 0.05 is considered significant. (b) Overview
  of the two terpene biosynthetic pathways in plants. PS-TPSs are highlighted in black
  bold. (c) Expression profiles of terpene biosynthesis-related genes in four tissues.
  (d) Expression profiles of terpene biosynthesis-related genes during the three flowering
  phases. The color bar represents the normalization for log2-FPKM using the Pheatmap
  software package. Intermediates abbreviations are: DMAPP, Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;
  DOXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GPP, geranyl
  pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  SPP, solanesyl pyrophosphate. Enzymes abbreviations are: AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase;
  DXR, DOXP reductoisomerase; DXS, DOXP synthase; FPS, FPP synthase; FK, farnesol
  kinase; GcpE, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-pyrophosphate synthase; GPS, GPP
  synthase; GGPS, GGPP synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase;
  IDI, isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase; IspD, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate
  cytidylyltransferase; IspE, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; IspF,
  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate synthase; IspH, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl
  pyrophosphate reductase; IspS, isoprene synthase; RCE1, prenyl protein peptidase;
  SPS, SPP synthase; TPS, terpene synthase.'
