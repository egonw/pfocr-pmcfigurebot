caption: AAV injection did not cause significant local damage in pancreas. (a) The
  time axis of AAV injection and drug intervention in caerulein plus LPS-induced pancreatitis.
  (b) Representative image of GFP stained pancreas 2 weeks after AAV injection. Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI. (n=5 per group, scale bar 200 μm) (c, d) Immunoblot analysis
  and quantification of TFAM proteins in pancreatitis after AAV-shTFAM infection compared
  to AAV-Con infection group (n=3 per group, scale bar 100 μm). (e) Representative
  graphs of H&E-stained pancreas showing no histological changes (n=5 per group).
  (f, g) Serum amylase and lipase detected by ELISA (n=5 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
