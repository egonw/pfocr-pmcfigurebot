caption: MapMan visualization of DEGs mapped to the biotic stress pathway in resistant
  Kufri Swarna (A) and susceptible Kufri Jyoti (B) in response to PCN infestation.
  DEGs are binned to MapMan functional categories and values are represented as log2
  fold change values. Red represents upregulated DEGs and green represents downregulated
  DEGs. R, response; PR, pathogen-related.
