caption: Workflow of the current analysis. The study consisted of several major steps.
  The primary step involves gathering gene expression datasets from NCBI GEO. Three
  datasets GSE147507, GSE38267, and GSE66494 are analysed for the patients of SARS-CoV-2,
  CF, and CKD, respectively. DEGs were identified using R and GEO2R. Similar DEGs
  were identified from total DEGs of three datasets using Venn diagram, and volcano
  plot employed to show significant genes. Corresponding similar DEGs were used to
  perform GO and pathway analysis. Then, attempted to construct the protein-protein
  interaction network (PPI), identify hub genes, module analysis, gene regulatory
  networks, and protein chemical interaction. In the final stage we have suggested
  some suitable drugs.
