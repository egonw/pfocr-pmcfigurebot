figure_title: Mechanism of action of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies
caption: a In a PD-L1 negative tumour, tumour neoantigens presented on the surface
  of tumour cells or APCs are detected by T cells, which are then activated to destroy
  the tumour cell. b Tumour cell or APC expression of PD-L1 prevents T cell activation
  and allows immune evasion. c Anti-PD-I antibodies can bind to PD-1 on T cells, preventing
  the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 and therefore enabling tumour cell destruction.
  d Anti-PD-L1 antibodies can bind to PD-L1 on tumour cells and APCs, preventing the
  interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 and enabling tumour cell destruction.
