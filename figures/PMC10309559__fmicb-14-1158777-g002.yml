caption: 'The signal pathway regulatory network of IFNβ. (A) NF-κB pathway and MAPK
  pathway When stimulated, TLRs recruited myeloid differentiation primary reactive
  protein 88 (MyD88) and IL-1 receptor-related kinases (IRAKs), and then bound tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-related factor 6 (TRAF6) to promote phosphorylation
  and polyubiquitination to activate TAK1. On the one hand, through ubiquitination,
  TAK1 binds to the catalytic subunits IKKα, IKKβ and regulatory subunits NEMO of
  the IKK complex, and finally forms two NF-кB heterodimers p50: RelA and p50: cRel
  into the nucleus to participate in gene expression. TAK1 activates MAPK kinase family
  members (MKKs) to produce c-Jun, c-Fos and CREB through AMPK pathway, and then forms
  polymeric complexes that bind to the promoter region to regulate the expression
  of IFNβ (; ). (B) MAVS-RIG pathway When the stimulus signal is detected, the conformation
  of RNA sensor RIG-I and MDA5 change to release the signal domain CARD. MAVS form
  MAVS complex with CARD in coordination with LPG2, which can cause the cascade reaction
  of TBK1/IRFs and also increases the activation of NF-кB to promote IFNβ expression
  (; ). (C) cGAS-STING pathway When recognizing DNA, cGAS catalyzes the reaction of
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form GMP-AMP (cGAMP).
  cGAMP binds to STING as a second messenger, causing STING to be palmitoacylated
  at two cysteine residues (Cys88 and Cys91), while recruiting TBK1 to form a complex.
  This complex triggers the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which then enters
  the nucleus to promote IFNβ production (; ). (D) JAK–STAT pathway The combination
  of parathine IFNβ and receptor IFNΑR leads to recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 by
  JAK, which phosphorylates Tyr701 of STAT1 and Tyr690 of STAT2 to form heterodimers
  that interact with IRF9 to form the trimer complex ISGF3. ISGF3 can increase IFNβ
  expression through transcription factors such as IRF3/7 in a positive feedback way
  (; ).'
