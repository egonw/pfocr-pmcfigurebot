caption: NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 promotes invasion and metastasis by activating cholesterol
  synthesis in breast cancer cells. A Classical Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software
  was used to identify the pathways enriched by NUCB2. B Relative total cholesterol
  expression in two pairs of stable cell lines. C Relative total cholesterol expression
  in shNUCB2-BT-549 and shNUCB2-MDA-MB-231 stable cell lines treated with exogenous
  Nesfatin-1 (0, 400, or 1000 pg/mL) for 48 h. D Migration and invasion of two pairs
  of stable cell lines treated with or without 2.5 μg/mL cholesterol for 48 h. E Changes
  in EMT-related epithelial or mesothelial molecular markers detected by Western blot
  in two pairs of stable cell lines treated with or without 2.5 μg/mL cholesterol
  for 48 h. Representative Western blots and relative quantitative data are shown.
  Statistical significance was verified using the non-paired T-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001)
