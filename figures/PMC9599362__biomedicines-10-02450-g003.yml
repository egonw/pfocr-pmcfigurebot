caption: BCR-dependent constitutive activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway
  in ABC-DLBCL. Genetic aberrations enforcing constitutive activation of the NF-κB
  signaling cascade downstream of the BCR, CD40 receptor, and TLR9 are a genetic hallmark
  of ABC (MCD/C5 and BN2) DLBCL. Direct targets of genetic lesions are shown in shades
  of blue (inactivation) and red (deregulated expression/activity), with symbols depicting
  gain-of-function and loss-of-function events. Percentages refer to ABC-DLBCL overall.
  This constellation of genetic events is also frequently observed in primary central
  nervous system lymphoma, PCNSL, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Note that, in
  the CBM complex, PKCβ directly phosphorylates CARD11.
