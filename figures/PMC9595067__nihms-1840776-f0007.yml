figure_title: In vivo Ca2+ imaging of the responses of GRPR neurons to scratching
  motion
caption: (A) Schedule of in vivo Ca2+ imaging during the CIB test.(B) Unilateral injection
  of AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-GCaMP6s and implantation of GRIN lens into the left SCN of GrpriCre
  mice. GRIN lens (500 μm diameter) was positioned above GCaMP6s-expressing SCN (~300
  μm diameter; 6 mm depth).(C) Representative image showing the GCaMP6s virus expression
  in SCN and the lens track.(D) A GrpriCre mouse with a head-mounted miniscope in
  a cylinder watches a mouse scratching video.(E) Schematized cell map of dynamic
  GRPR cells in the whole field view (upper two panels); independent component analysis
  derived GRPR neuron activity traces (bottom panel).(F) Cartoon illustrating an observer
  mouse looking at an ambulating mouse demonstrator (control, upper panel). Heatmap
  of normalized Ca2+ activation patterns from all individual GRPR cells recorded corresponding
  to the control look behavior (without any other associated behavior) toward the
  control demonstrator (lower panel). 0 s time point indicates the onset of look.(G)
  Cartoon illustrating an observer looking at a scratching demonstrator without ensuing
  scratching behavior (look-without-scratch, upper panel). Heatmap of normalized Ca2+
  activation patterns from all individual GRPR neurons recorded corresponding to the
  look-without-scratch behavior toward a scratching demonstrator (lower panel).(H)
  Cartoon illustrating an observer mouse displays an imitative scratch behavior (upper
  panel). Heatmap of normalized Ca2+ activity of individual GRPR cells corresponding
  to the look of imitative scratch in CIB during watching the scratching demonstrator.
  Imitative scratch behavior is defined as it occurring within 5 s following the look
  behavior.(I–K) Classification of GRPR cells according to the response to the control
  look (I), the look-without-scratch (J), and imitative scratches (look-and-scratch)
  (K).(L) Percentage of GRPR cells showing activated Ca2+response corresponding to
  the control look, look-without-scratch and imitative scratch.(M) Mean Ca2+ traces
  of neurons with activated Ca2+response corresponding to control look (16 neurons),
  look-without-scratch (34 neurons), and imitative scratch (45 neurons) (F = 20.81,
  p < 0.0001).A total of 161 neurons were recorded from 8 mice. Contingency chi-square
  test in (L). One-way ANOVA test in (M) for the area under the curve. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
