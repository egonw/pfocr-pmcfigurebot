caption: 'Methanotrophs in anaerobic digestion processes of WWTPs using the common
  methane oxidation pathway, which branches out for distinct metabolic cycles for
  each type of methanotrophs: types I, II, and X. It is these distinct secondary metabolic
  pathways, including the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, serine cycle, ethyl malonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway, glyoxylate regeneration cycle
  (GRC) and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, that produce a diversity of useful
  biomolecules.'
