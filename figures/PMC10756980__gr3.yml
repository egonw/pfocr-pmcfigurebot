caption: AS-605240 in combination of Melphalan arrested cell cycle progression of
  MM cells. (A–B) Cell viability rate and cell growth curve of U266 cells, which were
  treated with control, 5 μM AS-605240 or 4 μM Melphalan or 5 μM AS-605240 combined
  with 4 μM Melphalan were shown. (C–D) Cell viability rate and cell growth curve
  of ARP-1 cells, which were treated with control, 5 μM AS-605240 or 4 μM Melphalan
  or 5 μM AS-605240 combined with 4 μM Melphalan were shown. (E–F) Cell cycle was
  detected by flow cytometry after treatment with control, 5 μM AS-605240 or 4 μM
  Melphalan or 5 μM AS-605240 combined with 4 μM Melphalan in U266 and ARP-1 cells,
  respectively. DMSO was used as control. Data shown are mean values ± standard errors
  from three experiments. *p < 0.05 compared with the control group.
