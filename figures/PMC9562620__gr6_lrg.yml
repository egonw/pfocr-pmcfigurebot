caption: 'Effects of XFBD on pathological changes to lung tissue in LPS-induced ALI
  model mice revealed by Hematoxylin and eosin Staining. (A) Serial sections of lung
  tissues were stained with H&E Scale bar = 100 μm (magnification: x200). (B) Statistical
  results of lung pathological damage. Data are shown as mean ± SD by ANOVA. n = 3.
  ##p < 0.01 vs control group, **p < 0.01 vs LPS group.'
