caption: 'Anti-cancer effects of chrysin in the proposed mouse xenograft mouse model.
  (A) Representative specimen of immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, HIF-1α, and
  VEGF and bar graph expressing the Ki-67, HIF-1α, and VEGF percentage of stained
  cells (%) in tumor sections. Data represent mean ± SD; n = 6/group. * p < 0.05,
  and ** p < 0.01 (compared to control group). (B) Western blotting for SPHK-1, HIF-1α,
  VEGF, VE-cadherin, Cyclin D1, c-cas3, PARP, and β-actin of selected tumors. Bar
  graphs represent the quantification of interest protein related to β-actin, presented
  as a fold change of control. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 when compared to untreated
  control. (C) The concentration of VEGF in the serum samples of nude mice determined
  by ELISA. Data represent mean ± SD; n = 6/group. *** p < 0.001 (compared to normal
  control (N)), and # p < 0.05 (compared to control (C)).'
