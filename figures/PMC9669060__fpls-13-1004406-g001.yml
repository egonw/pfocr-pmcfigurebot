caption: Involvement of calcium signaling in response to biotic and elevated temperature
  constraints. Plant defense responses to pathogens trigger calcium variations which
  are relayed by calcium sensors (CaM, CMLs, CDPKs or CBLs) to targets allowing the
  establishment of specific responses. The P. syringae’s flagellin is recognized by
  the Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRR) complex FLS2/BAK1 and induce PTI leading
  to the kinase BIK1 phosphorylation which phosphorylates CNGC calcium channels and
  allows calcium entry. The NLR ZAR1 recognizes P. syringae effectors delivered in
  the cytosol inducing ETI and forms a pentameric structure integrating the plasmalemma
  (resistosome) () to act as a calcium-permeable channel. CNGC2-4 are also temperature-sensitive
  channels allowing calcium entry upon temperature elevation (). Their activity is
  negatively regulated by the CaM7 (). In response to elevated temperature, the rice
  TT2 complex, composed by a G-subunit, is involved in thermotolerance (). TT2 signaling
  pathway is mediated by the transcription factor SCT1 that interact with CaM to repress
  genes required for thermotolerance. Under combined flagellin treatment and elevated
  temperature condition, SA production is repressed and PTI inhibited through CBP60g/SARD1
  and CaM-binding SR1/CAMTA3 dependent pathways (; ).
