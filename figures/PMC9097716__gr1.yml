caption: Two hundred twenty-eight and eight genes were respectively identified as
  posttranscriptionally regulated genes with independent protein upregulation in iPSCs/ESCs
  and HDFs(A) Workflow for identifying posttranscriptionally regulated genes using
  mass spectrometry (MS) for proteins and microarray for mRNA. Two iPSC lines (iPSC-1,
  201B7 and iPSC-2, 1418E1), one ESC line (H9), and two HDF lines (HDF-1, HDF1388
  and HDF-2, Tig120) were used.(B) The mRNA-to-protein expression ratio in iPSC-1
  and HDF-1 for each gene (Gray). Yellow and green indicate commonly varied genes
  in iPSCs/ESCs and HDFs, those with only upregulated mRNA, and those with only upregulated
  protein levels, respectively (p < 0.05, two-sample unpaired t test, biological triplicate).
  Log2 scale. Comparisons of the mRNA-and-protein ratios between all pairs of iPSCs/ESCs
  and HDF lines are shown in B and S1C. The total number of genes quantified was 6404.
  All yellow and green plotted data are shown in . See S1A and “” in  for details.(C)
  The number of genes and the GO analysis of molecular functions for genes that were
  significantly upregulated only at the protein or mRNA level in B.(D) The mRNA-to-protein
  expression ratio in iPSC-1 and HDF-1 and in ESC and HDF-1 for metabolic pathway-,
  ribosome-, and spliceosome-related genes. The correlation coefficients (r) are shown.
  Black indicates total genes, and green indicates commonly varied genes in iPSCs/ESCs
  and HDFs that were only upregulated in protein levels in B and C (uPRA genes). Comparisons
  of the mRNA-and-protein ratios between all pairs of iPSC/ESC and HDF lines are shown
  in .
