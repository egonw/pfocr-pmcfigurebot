caption: Profound changes in the global transcriptional landscape between parental
  and erlotinib-resistant cells. (A) Heatmap of genes that were differentially expressed
  (DEGs) between HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. The color represents the level of transformed
  gene expression of log10. (B) Volcano plot displaying genes detected by RNA-Seq.
  Red points represent up-regulated DEGs (FoldChange ≥ 2, q value ≤ 0.001). Blue points
  represent down-regulated DEGs (FoldChange ≤ −2, q value ≤ 0.001). Gray points represent
  non-DEGs. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes up-regulated or down-regulated
  in pairwise comparison of HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. FDR ˂ 0.05 signified statistical
  significance. (D) Biological process, (E) cellular components, and (F) molecular
  function annotations of gene ontology were significantly enriched in genes that
  were differentially expressed between HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. Top 10 terms of
  each class were performed. FDR ˂ 0.05 signified statistical significance.
