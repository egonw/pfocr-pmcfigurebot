caption: Proposed metabolic reconstruction of the assimilation pathway of butyrate
  based on FC values and targeting predictions. The log2 FC acetate/butyrate value
  is indicated by the color codes. All di/tricarboxylic acids that may be imported
  into the mitochondria are indicated in blue. Enzymes with a red halo are involved
  in antioxidant defense. Enzymes codes and further information can be found in  and
  the .
