caption: 'Subclustering of monocytes based on TI responses, which are changes between
  T3m_LPS and T0_LPS(A) Unsupervised clustering using the top 50 most variable genes
  in monocytes. For each gene in each cell, the value was calculated by the difference
  in T3m_LPS and the mean value of the corresponding gene in the corresponding individual
  in T0_LPS. Spearman correlation was calculated between cells, and k-means was used
  to cluster cells. In total, four distinct monocytes were identified. See also A
  and S4B.(B) UMAP visualization of identified monocyte subpopulations. Monocytes
  were extracted from the UMAP of PBMC in T3m_LPS, and cells in each subpopulation
  were mapped to UMAP directly. Four subpopulations were independently distributed,
  which may demonstrate their heterogeneous functions in TI.(C) Expression level of
  markers in four defined monocyte subpopulations. Based on the markers, four subpopulations
  were defined: type I IFN-related monocytes (TM1); proinflammatory cytokine monocytes
  (mainly IL-1 pathway) (TM2); proinflammatory monocytes (combination of chemokines
  and IFNs) (TM3); and neutrophil-related monocytes (TM4).(D) Comparative analysis
  of four monocyte subpopulations and previously reported monocyte subpopulations
  (i.e., MCI and MC) using an in vitro dataset. Markers of MCI and MC were selected
  from Zhang et al. The expression pattern indicated that TM1–TM3 were subtypes of
  MCI while TM4 tended to have characteristics similar to those of MC.'
