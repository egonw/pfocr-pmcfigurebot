caption: 'MYCL silencing inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration and
  invasion. Migration of (A) MDA-MB-453 cells transfected with MYCL siRNAs and (B)
  MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL was detected by wound healing assay (scale
  bar, 100 µm). Transwell assay detected the invasion of (C) MDA-MB-453 cells transfected
  with MYCL siRNAs and (D) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL (scale bar, 200
  µm). Expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin in (E) MDA-MB-453
  cells transfected with MYCL siRNAs and (F) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL
  were detected by western blotting. *P<0.05 vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. NC, negative
  control; si/siRNA, small interfering RNA; MYCL, MYCL proto-oncogene.'
