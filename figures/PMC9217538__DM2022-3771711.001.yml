caption: Expressive level of TOPK, NF-κB p65, p-IκBα, Beclin-1, and LC3 in cSCC cancer
  tissues and adjacent tissues. IHC analysis revealed that the expression of TOPK
  (a) was higher in cSCC cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. The expressive levels
  of NF-κB p65 (b), p-IκBα (c), Beclin-1 (d), and LC3 (e) were significantly higher
  in cSCC cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues.
