caption: 'Effects of ST2825 on the production of LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 in BV2
  cells. Relative mRNA levels of (A) iNOS and (B) COX-2 were assessed by RT-PCR. The
  protein levels of (C) iNOS and (D) COX-2 were assessed by Western blot. Values are
  mean ± SEM (n = 3). ## p < 0.01 vs. control group; ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS group.'

  and the ROS/NLRP3/Cleaved Caspase-1 Signaling Pathway to Attenuate Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated
  Neuroinflammation.
