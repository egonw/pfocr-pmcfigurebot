figure_title: In vivo CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function studies confirm the essentiality
  of cancer porphyrin overdrive
caption: (A) Porphyrin overdrive, resulting from the absence of heme metabolism hemostasis,
  is indicated by the essentiality of the genes for the intermediate enzymatic steps
  of heme biosynthesis in both murine pancreatic and lung cancer models. The figure
  shows the comparison of gene essentialities between in vitro and in vivo cancer
  models, and their statistically significant differences (column 3 of both panels)
  are indicated with *. The different shades of magenta indicate the different degrees
  of gene essentiality. The color scheme reflects the pancreatic essentiality in the
  study. Both in vitro and in vivo essentiality data were retrieved from . The increased
  gene essentiality, from in vitro to in vivo, of the intermediate step of heme biosynthesis
  genes (HBMS, UROS, CPOX, PPOX) is the only shared metabolic essentiality between
  pancreatic and lung cancers, which are indicated with *. The in vitro gene essentiality
  data indicate that the functional intermediate enzymatic steps in heme biosynthesis
  are independent of tumor origin or tissue environment (). (B) Analysis of âˆ¼2,900
  metabolic-related genes (retrieved from ref 9) shows similar gene essentiality in
  the in vitro and in vivo settings, indicating that the survival of tumor cells depends
  on the examined encoded metabolic enzymes both in vitro and in murine pancreatic
  and lung cancer models. No statistically significant/essential differences were
  observed for the essentialities of ALAS1, ALAS2, and FECH, the genes for the first
  and terminal enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway, in either of the in vivo
  murine cancer models (adj, adjusted).
