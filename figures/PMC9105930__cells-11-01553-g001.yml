caption: Schematic of components and mechanisms of PI3K/Akt activation and regulation
  (a). PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell death during MI (b). PI3K/Akt signaling is
  a key component in the regulation of numerous processes in the peri-infarct period
  and post-infarction remodeling of the left ventricle (c). Akt—protein kinase B,
  Bax—Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-xL—B-cell lymphoma-extra large, Bcl-2—B-cell
  lymphoma 2, c—cytochrome c, DNA-PK—DNA-dependent protein kinase, GFs—growth factors,
  GPX4—glutathione peroxidase 4, GSK3β—glycogen synthase kinase 3 β, IKKα—IκB kinase
  α, IL-1β, IL-18—interleukins 1β and 18, IRS—insulin receptor substrate, JNK—c-Jun
  NH2-terminal kinase, MAPK—mitogen-activated protein kinase, MUFA—monounsaturated
  fatty acids, MLKL—mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, mTORC1, mTORC2—mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2, NF-κB—nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells, NLR—NOD-like receptor, P—phosphate, PDK1—phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1, PHLPP—pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase,
  PIP2—phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PIP3—phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate,
  PI3K—phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PPARβ/ɣ—peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  β/ɣ, PP2A—protein phosphatase 2, PTEN—phosphatase and tensin homolog, RIP1, RIP3—receptor-interacting
  protein 1 and 3, RTK—receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD1—stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, SREBP1—sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein-1, S6K1—ribosomal S6 kinase-1, TNFα—tumor necrosis
  factor α, TNFR—tumor necrosis factor receptor, 4EBPs—eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein 1.
