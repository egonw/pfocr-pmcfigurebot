caption: Validation of the SLC score in the TCGA-COAD and SYSUCC cohort. (A) Heatmaps
  displaying the comparison of the transcriptome similarity between the SLC-S2 subtype
  in meta-GEO cohort and high SLC score group in TCGA-COAD (upper) and SYSUCC (down)
  cohorts. (B) The correlations of the SLC score with tumor microenvironment (lower)
  and biological pathway activation status (upper) in the SYSUCC cohort. (C) The correlation
  chord chart shows the mutual correlation between mesenchymal cell abundance, OLFM4
  high cell abundance, secretory cell enrichment level, and SLC score in the SYSUCC
  cohort. (D) Sankey diagram of SLC score in different CMS subtypes in the SYSUCC
  cohort. (E) The correlations of the SLC score with tumor microenvironment (lower)
  and biological pathway activation status (upper) in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (F) The
  correlation chord chart shows the mutual correlation between mesenchymal cell abundance,
  OLFM4 high cell abundance, secretory cell enrichment level, and SLC score in the
  TCGA-COAD cohort. (G) Sankey diagram of SLC score in groups with different molecular
  subtypes in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (H) Kaplan–Meier curves of overall survival according
  to SLC score in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (I) Forest plot (upper) of associations between
  the SLC score and overall survival in subgroups stratified by adjuvant chemotherapy
  conduction of TCGA-COAD cohort. Forest plot (down) of benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy
  in different SLC score groups in the TCGA-COAD cohort. (J–K) Violin plot of SLC
  score values among patients with different fluorouracil responses in the TCGA-COAD
  (J) and SYSUCC (K) cohort. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. SLC, solute carrier;
  ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy; RFS, relapse-free survival; OS, overall survival; CI,
  confidence interval; HMC, histone modification cluster; CMS, consensus molecular
  subtypes; TMEC, tumor microenvironment cluster; R, response; NR, nonresponse; and
  ADJC, adjuvant chemotherapy.
