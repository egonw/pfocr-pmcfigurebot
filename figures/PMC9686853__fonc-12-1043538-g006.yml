caption: DNA-PK is activated and required for phosphorylation of ATM, 53BP1 and p53
  downstream of integrin α6β4. BT549 cells (EV and β4) were plated on laminin-1-coated
  plates, pretreated with DNA-PK inhibitors NU7441 (A) at indicated concentrations
  for 1 hr, or electroporated with 200nM non-targeting siRNA or siRNA targeting DNA-PKcs
  for 72h (C) before treatment with 10µM cisplatin for 24h. Cell lysates were then
  immunoblotted for signaling proteins in DNA repair pathway as noted and quantified
  as fold change compared to total protein controls (B, D). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005.
  (E) BT549 cells (EV and β4) plated on laminin-1-coated coverslips were treated with
  10µM cisplatin for 24h and then the associations of DNA-PKcs, p53, and 53BP1 were
  assessed by PLA, as noted. Scale bars, 10µm.
