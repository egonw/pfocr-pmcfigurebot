figure_title: Knockdown of tRF-Val inhibits the growth of GC in vivo
caption: A The workflow of subcutaneous tumorigenesis. B The tumors of nude mice were
  dissected at 4 weeks after AGS cells injection in sh-NC and sh-Val groups (n = 5
  mice per group). C, D The weights and volumes of the tumors were significantly decreased
  in the sh-Val group than those in the sh-NC group. E, F The WB and IHC results indicated
  that expressions of p53, p21, and Bax were upregulated, while that expression of
  Bcl2 was downregulated in the sh-Val group. The scale bar, 100 μm (200×); 50 μm
  (400×). G The schematic diagram of the mechanisms that tRF-Val directly bound to
  EEF1A1, mediated its entry into the nucleus and promoted its binding with MDM2,
  thus inhibited the downstream molecular pathway of p53 and promote GC progression.
  Data were shown as mean ± SD. (Student’s t-test, **P < 0.01).

  inhibits apoptosis by targeting EEF1A1 in gastric cancer.
