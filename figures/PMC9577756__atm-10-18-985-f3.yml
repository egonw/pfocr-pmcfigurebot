caption: 'Effects of CBD on MA-induced cardiac histopathological changes, cytokine,
  and cTnI expression. (A) Images represent H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining, respectively.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. The control (a, f) and CBD80 (b, g) groups showed normal myocardial
  tissue structure. The MA group (c, h) showed myocardial fiber disorder, myocyte
  vacuolization, mononuclear inflammatory infiltration (blue arrow), and blue-stained
  collagen fibrils in perivascular and interstitial spaces. Compared to the MA group,
  the CBD40 + MA group (d, i) still exhibited mononuclear inflammatory infiltration
  in interstitial spaces or around the blood vessels (blue arrow) and showed less
  perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. The CBD80 + MA group (e, j) showed cardiac
  myocyte degeneration, and almost no collagen fibrils in the perivascular and interstitial
  spaces. (B) The content of myocardium fibrosis. The serum levels of IL-6 (C) and
  IL-10 (D) were detected by ELISAs. (E) cTnI expression in the left ventricle was
  measured by Western blot analysis. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. **,
  P<0.01; ***, P<0.001 vs. control group. #, P<0.05; ##, P<0.01; ###, P<0.001 vs.
  MA group. CBD, cannabidiol; MA, methamphetamine; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; IL,
  interleukin; ELISA, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; SD, standard deviation.'
