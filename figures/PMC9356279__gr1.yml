caption: BPTF was highly expressed in CRC and promoted the proliferation and metastasis
  of CRC cells. (A) BPTF expression was detected in human embryonic intestinal mucosal
  tissue-derived cell line CCC-HIE-2, human small intestinal epithelial cell line
  FHs 74 Int and different CRC cell lines (LoVo, SW620, HCT116, RKO, DLD1) by Western
  Blot. (B–C) BPTF expression in tumor tissues (T) or adjacent normal tissues (N)
  from CRC patients was determined through Western Blot (B) or IHC (C). Representative
  pictures were shown. Score of IHC staining was displayed by scatter plot. Scale
  bars, 100 μm. (D–I) BPTF was knocked down by its specific siRNAs in CRC cell lines
  (LoVo, SW620). 48h after transfection, (D) BPTF expression, (E) cell viability,
  (F) colony formation, (G) cell migration, (H) cell invasion, (I) the expressions
  of proliferation-related PI3K/AKT pathway and EMT-related proteins were respectively
  analyzed. Representative images were shown. Scale bars in (G), 500 μm. Scale bars
  in (H), 200 μm. The data represented the mean ± SD of three independent experiments,
  and the level of significance was indicated by ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
  siCtrl, control siRNA.
