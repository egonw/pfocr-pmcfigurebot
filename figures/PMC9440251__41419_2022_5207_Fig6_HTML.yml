figure_title: Nintedanib induces a senolytic effect in senescent HDFs via JAK2/STAT3
  pathway
caption: Proposed mechanism of senolytic effect induced by nintedanib. Nintedanib-induced
  senescent cell death is mediated by inhibiting STAT3 activity. Additionally, nintedanib
  causes cell cycle arrest in nonsenescent cells by regulating CDK2.
