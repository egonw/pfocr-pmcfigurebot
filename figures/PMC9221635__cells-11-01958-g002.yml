caption: Telomere maintenance in cancer cells. Schematic images of (A) the telomerase
  complex and (B) pathways associated with telomerase and ALT in cancer cells. Cancer
  cells overcome telomere shortening by telomere maintenance mechanisms such as telomerase
  and ALT. In the telomerase complex, the telomerase RNA component TERC has the H/ACA
  motif and recruits the H/ACA proteins to stabilize the complex. In ALT, telomere
  lengthening is mediated by the HR-based DNA repair machinery. Molecules in the telomere
  maintenance also show the mitochondrial functions. In addition, cytosolic dsDNA
  fractions known as ECTR, which are produced from ALT, trigger the cGAS-STING pathway.
