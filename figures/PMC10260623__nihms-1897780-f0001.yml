figure_title: A schematic of the clock pathway
caption: The circadian oscillatory activity of the heterodimer basic helix loop helix
  class TFs that contain BMAL1 is driven by two principal feedback loops (marked red).
  The downstream effector genes of the clock pathway are regulated by various output
  mediators that interact with distinct transcription control elements including E-boxes,
  CAAT-boxes, D-boxes, and ROREs (see text for more details). Regulatory mechanisms
  that involve altered transcription or inhibition of transcription factor activity
  at the protein level are marked. Note that while those regulatory mechanisms occur
  in the nucleus, PER/CRY heterodimers may form in the cytoplasm with PER having a
  stabilizing effect on CRY and promoting nuclear translocation of CRY. Also, regulated
  translation of many core components of the clock pathway is cytoplasmic. Such additional
  regulatory steps contribute to oscillating activity of the clock pathway.
