figure_title: Trib1 deletion during chronic LCMV infection is characterized by enrichment
  of KLR-associated genes within a complete pathway of T cell exhaustion
caption: 'scRNA-sequencing was performed on FACS-sorted total activated T cells (CD44+TCRβ+)
  from Trib1 WT (CD4-Cre+Trib1+/+) or Trib1 KO (CD4-Cre+Trib1f/f) mice that had been
  infected with clone 13 15 days prior, as previously described. To exclude CD4+ T
  cells from this new analysis, all barcodes expressing any CD4 mRNA were excluded.
  (A) A new visualization of single-cell clustering of all CD8+ cells using TooManyCells
  . With this method, individual cells all begin at the central node and then are
  recursively divided based on transcriptional differences, resulting in branches
  or clusters on the tree. Branch width corresponds to cell number and color represents
  the proportion of cellular genotype making up that branch. In this case, blue represents
  Trib1 KO and red Trib1 WT. Each terminal branch ends with a node or leaf that is
  sized based on the number of cells present in that node. 9 main branches or clusters
  are identified as shown in (A). (B) Volcano plot depicting DEGs in CD8+ cells of
  either Trib1 WT or Trib1 KO cells. The KLRs and the Hcst (encodes DAP10 a critical
  adaptor protein for NKG2D signaling) are highlighted in red text. (C) The top 40
  DEGs between Trib1 WT and Trib1 KO CD8+ cells in Cluster 1–4 and as combined progenitor
  populations (Clusters 5–9). Blue indicates higher expression in WT CD8+ cells and
  red higher expression in Trib1 KO CD8+ cells. (D) Proportion of WT and Trib1 KO
  cells in the representative populations, as defined by the scRNA-seq using TooManyCells.
  TPROG cell frequency was calculated by combining cell numbers from clusters 5, 6,
  7, and 8 on the dendogram in (A). TKLR, TINT, TINT Proliferating, and TTERM correspond
  to clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. (B) Fisher’s exact test demonstrating differential
  representation of WT and Trib1 KO cells in TPROG, TKLR, TINT, TINT Proliferating,
  and TTERM subsets. Trib1 WT: CD4-cre+ Trib1+/+, Trib1 KO: CD4-cre+ Trib1F/F'

  to a KLR+ CD8+ effector state and its deletion improves checkpoint blockade.
