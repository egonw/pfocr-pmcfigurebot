caption: A model of how FAHD1 activity may modulate U2OS metabolism. (A) In U2OS cells,
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle operates independently, relying on both glycolysis
  and glutaminolysis to sustain the tricarboxylic acid flux. The PEP-PYR-OAA node
  remains stable, ensuring a consistent supply of mtGDP for the synthesis of succinate
  (SUC). (B) Overexpression of hFAHD1.1 in U2OS cells enhances glycolysis, leading
  to a reduction in oxaloacetate levels. This reduction impairs the citrate synthase
  (CS) reaction, consequently diminishing tricarboxylic acid flux and lowering complex
  I activity and ROS levels. To compensate for oxaloacetate depletion, the PEP-PYR-OAA
  node is upregulated, generating mtGDP and SUC. With decreased tricarboxylic acid
  cycle flux, NAD+ cannot be produced via complex I, prompting cytosolic lactate production
  to regenerate NAD+. This is facilitated by increased glycolysis. (C) Surprisingly,
  overexpression of hFAHD1.1-T192S in U2OS cells does not enhance glycolysis but shifts
  metabolism towards glutaminolysis. Similarly to hFAHD1.1 overexpression, oxaloacetate
  levels are reduced, impairing CS reaction and lowering tricarboxylic acid flux and
  complex I activity. As oxaloacetate levels may be drastically reduced, the PEP-PYR-OAA
  node may not sufficiently compensate. Consequently, the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  may be maintained through glutaminolysis. NADP+ may be generated via reductive isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) activity, or NAD+ via the nicotinamide (NAM) salvage pathway.
  Oxaloacetate may also be replenished through a non-canonical tricarboxylic acid
  cycle, involving citrate export into the cytosol (via SLC25A1), reduction, and subsequent
  import of malate and NAD+ into mitochondria. Malate can then be converted to oxaloacetate,
  providing fuel for complex I. (D) Overexpression of hFAHD1.1-K123A in U2OS cells
  appears to bypass glycolysis, downregulating PC, FAHD1, and PEPCK-M. This likely
  indicates a catalytic knockdown of FAHD1 via overexpression of a loss-of-function
  variant. Although the underlying mechanisms require further elucidation, it seems
  that glycolysis and the PEP-PYR-OAA node may be completely shut down, with cells
  relying solely on glutaminolysis. Despite similarities to the wild-type setup (A),
  this metabolic rerouting is weaker. Consequently, these cells exhibit increased
  mitochondrial content to compensate but otherwise behave similarly to wild-type
  cells in most experiments, including nearly unchanged ROS levels. Regulation of
  fumarate (FUM) levels may occur through adjacent pathways to compensate for the
  lack of biosynthesis.
