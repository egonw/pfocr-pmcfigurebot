caption: miR-22-5p inhibits the cancer-promoting effect of TOP2A. (a) Venn diagram
  shows the miRNAs predicted by the database that can interact with TOP2A mRNA. (b)
  qRT-PCR revealed the miRNA expression in liver cancer tissues and ADT. (c) qRT-PCR
  showed that the expression level of TOP2A mRNA in the HCC cell line (MHCC97L) transfected
  with miRNAs. (d) Western blot analysis demonstrated the TOP2A protein expression
  in the HCC cell line (MHCC97L and BEL-7404) transfected with miRNAs (e) RNA levels
  of miR-22-5p, GAPDH, and U6 in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of MHCC97L
  cells. (f) Wound healing assays of HCC cells (MHCC97L and BEL-7404) transfected
  with miR-Ctrl or miR-22-5p mimics. (g) Transwell invasion assay of HCC cells (MHCC97L
  and BEL-7404) transfected with miR-Ctrl or miR-22-5p mimics. The bar graphs show
  the number of migrating and invasive cells after 24 h. (h) Western blotting was
  utilized for detection E-cad and Hippo pathway-associated protein expression in
  HCC cells (MHCC97L and BEL-7404) transfected with miR-Ctrl or miR-22-5p mimics.
  (i) Dual-luciferase reporter assay to detect the activity of LUC-TOP2A-wt or LUC-TOP2A-mutant
  in MHCC97L cells after overexpression of miR-22-5p. The predicted binding site of
  miR-22-5p in TOP2A. The mut sequence contains a 7-base mutation in the miR-22-5p
  target seed region. The wild-type and a mutated type of binding site between miR-22-5p
  and TOP2A.Data are shown as mean ± SEM; ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.
