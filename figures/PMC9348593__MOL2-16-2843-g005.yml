caption: 'Knockdown of PGAM1 inhibits BC cell proliferation, invasion, migration,
  and EMT process in vitro. (A, B) PGAM1 knockdown efficiencies following lentivirus
  transduction detected by western blot in BC cell lines (n = 3). (C, D) Proliferative
  abilities of shScr‐ and shPGAM1‐BC cell lines detected by cell proliferation assays
  (n = 3). (E, F) Representative images of shScr‐ and shPGAM1‐BC cell lines from transwell
  invasion assays [n = 5, scale bar: 100 μm (E), 50 μm (F)]. (G, H) Migration abilities
  of shScr‐ and shPGAM1‐BC cell lines detected by wound healing assay (n = 5). Scale
  bar: 100 μm. (I, J) The protein levels of E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin, Vimentin, Snail,
  and Slug in BC cells detected by western blot (n = 3). Data was analyzed by ANOVA
  (C, D) or t‐test (E–H), and was shown as mean ± SD. **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001,
  ****P < 0.0001.'
