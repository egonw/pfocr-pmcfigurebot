caption: 'MaR1 reversed high glucose-induced ROS overproduction through cAMP-SOD2
  antioxidant pathway. (a) DCFH-DA probe was used to detect the levels of ROS in high
  glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells with MaR1 intervention. Bar: 50 μm. (b) ELISA assay
  showing the levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in cell culture supernatant of high glucose-stimulated
  HK-2 cells with MaR1 intervention. (c) The concentrations of cAMP in DKD mouse kidney
  with MaR1 intervention. (d) The concentrations of cAMP in high glucose-stimulated
  HK-2 cells with MaR1 intervention. (e) Representative immunohistochemistry images
  showing the protein levels of SOD2 in DKD mouse kidney with MaR1 intervention. (f)
  qRT-PCR showing the mRNA levels of SOD2 in DKD mouse kidney with MaR1 intervention.
  (g) Representative western blotting analysis images showing the protein levels of
  SOD2 in DKD mouse kidney with MaR1 intervention. (h) Representative western blotting
  analysis images showing the protein levels of SOD2 in high glucose-stimulated HK-2
  cells with MaR1 intervention. All results are representative of three independent
  experiments. Data were expressed as mean ± SD; ∗P <0.05; ∗∗P <0.01; ∗∗∗P <0.001.'
