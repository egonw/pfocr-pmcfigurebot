caption: The pathway analysis. (A) The top 10 enrichment results of KEGG. The color
  of nodes represented the P value. The redder the color, the lower the P value was.
  The higher the enrichment score and the smaller the P value, the more significant
  the function was. (B) The lipid and atherosclerosis pathway. The proteins marked
  red in this pathway were closely associated with the overlapping targets of RPA
  and RLS (AKT, JNK, p38, ERK, CYP, HSP, PPARÎ³, GSK3B, CASP3, and CASP7). (C) The
  endocrine resistance pathway. The proteins marked red were closely related to the
  overlapping targets (ER, JNK, p38, ERK1/2, AKT, EGFR, and IGF1R). (D) The prolactin
  signaling pathway. The proteins marked red were closely associated with the overlapping
  targets (AKT, JNK, p38, ERK, GSK3B, and ERA/B). (E) The IL-17 signaling pathway.
  The proteins marked red were closely associated with the overlapping targets (CASP,
  HSP90, MAPKS, ERK, and GSK3B). (F) The gene-pathway network. The red and brown nodes
  represented genes and pathways, respectively. The edges represented the connection
  between them. KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, RLS = restless legs
  syndrome, RPA = Radix Paeoniae Alba.
