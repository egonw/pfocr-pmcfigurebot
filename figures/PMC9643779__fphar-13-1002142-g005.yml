caption: 'Sunitinib induces excessive ROS which activates MAPKs, thereby inducing
  apoptosis and autophagy in L02 cells. (A) L02 cells were exposed with Sunitinib
  at 15 μM for 6, 9, 12, 24 h. ROS levels were analyzed using a ROS assay kit. Green
  fluorescence was observed on fluorescence microscopy (scale bars = 50 μm). (B) Quantification
  of ROS intensities. (C) The viability of hepatocytes was analyzed by MTT after L02
  cells were incubated with 5 μM, 10 μM, and 15 μM Sunitinib for 48 h in the presence
  or absence of 10 mM NAC pretreatment for 6 h (n = 6). (D) ALT, AST, and LDH levels
  in the supernatant after L02 cells were incubated with 15 μM Sunitinib for 48 h
  in the presence or absence of 10 mM NAC pretreatment for 6 h (n = 3). (E,F) Protein
  expression of p-JNK/JNK, p-ERK/ERK, and p-P38/P38 after L02 cells were incubated
  with 10 μM Sunitinib for 12 h in the presence or absence of 10 mM NAC pretreatment
  for 6 h (n = 3). (G,H) LC3B levels in L02 cells after Sunitinib (15 μM) for 48 h
  in the presence or absence of 10 mM NAC pretreatment for 6 h (n = 3). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 vs. Control group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 and ###p <
  0.001 vs. Sunitinib group.'
