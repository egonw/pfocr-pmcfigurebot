caption: 'Expression of MST1, LATS1, YAP1 and TEAD1 mRNA in mammary gland of Yak at
  different developmental stages: 1, GP; 2, LP; 3, DP. mRNA expression levels of MST1,
  LATS1, YAP1, and TEAD1 showed significant variation at the different stages after
  normalization to the internal reference gene (Î²-actin). *, the expression of the
  same factor was significantly different in different periods (0.01 < p < 0.05);
  **, the difference was extremely significant (p < 0.01).'
