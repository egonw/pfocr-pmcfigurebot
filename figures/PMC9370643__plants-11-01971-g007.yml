caption: Evaluation of differential auxin pathway regulation between BNF-contrasting
  genotypes. (a) Schematic representation of auxin pathway showing the DET identified
  related to auxin biosynthesis, auxin transporter and auxin signaling in roots and
  shoots of germinated stalks. In red are represented the transcripts more expressed
  in SP and in blue are represented the ones more expressed in CH. (b) Evaluation
  of crown roots in the stalk plants (naturally colonized by endophytes). (c) Representative
  photos of germinated stalks 15 days after planting of CH (left) and SP (right) demonstrate
  the differences observed in the quantitative analysis. Bars represent mean Â± standard
  deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks (*) represent significant difference
  between SP and CH at the same time point through t-test (p < 0.05).
