caption: miR-26a-5p/DNMT3A/SFRP1 axis affects cell viability and stem cell-like phenotype
  by regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway in NSCLC. (a, c, and h) Protein levels of DNMT3A,
  CCND1, MYC, β-catenin, NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 were determined by western blotting
  after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and DNMT3A coupregulation, miR-26a-5p
  upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p upregulation and HLY78 stimulation.
  (b) The distribution and expression of β-catenin in the subcellular fraction after
  miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and DNMT3A coupregulation, miR-26a-5p upregulation
  and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p upregulation and HLY78 stimulation. (d)
  Cell viability was examined using CCK-8 assay after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p
  and DNMT3A coupregulation, miR-26a-5p upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and
  miR-26a-5p upregulation and HLY78 stimulation. (e) Cell colony formation was determined
  by plate clone assay after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and DNMT3A coupregulation,
  upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p upregulation and HLY78 stimulation.
  (f) Cell cycle was detected by FCM after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and
  DNMT3A coupregulation, miR-26a-5p upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p
  upregulation and HLY78 stimulation. (g) CSC-like property was detected using sphere
  formation assay after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and DNMT3A coupregulation,
  miR-26a-5p upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p upregulation and
  HLY78 stimulation. (i) CD34, CD133, and ALDH1 positive cells were identified by
  FCM after miR-26a-5p upregulation, miR-26a-5p and DNMT3A coupregulation, miR-26a-5p
  upregulation and SFRP1 downregulation, and miR-26a-5p upregulation and HLY78 stimulation.
  Control group was used as the blank control. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
