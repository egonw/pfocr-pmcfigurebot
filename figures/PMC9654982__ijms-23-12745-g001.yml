caption: 'A simplified overview of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Central to
  sphingolipid metabolism is ceramide synthesis and regulation. The pathway in light
  blue above ceramide represents the de novo pathway of ceramide synthesis. The other
  pathways branching from ceramide represent other means of synthesis and degradation
  of ceramide and of other sphingolipid molecules. The figure was created using BioRender.com
  (accessed on 21 October 2022). C16:0-ceramide structure from www.lipidmaps.org (accessed
  on 21 October 2022). SPT: serine palmitoyltransferase; 3-KDSR: 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  reductase; CerS: ceramide synthase; DES: dihydroceramide delta(4)-desaturase; aSMase:
  acid sphingomyelinase; nSMase: neutral sphingomyelinase; SMS: sphingomyelin synthase;
  DAG: diacylglycerol; PC: phosphatidylcholine; CDase: ceramidase; SPHK: sphingosine
  kinase; S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate; C1P: ceramide-1-phosphate; CERK: ceramide
  kinase.'
