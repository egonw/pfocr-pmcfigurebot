caption: Upregulated ADAMDEC1 in NSCLC is associated with poor prognosis. (a) Volcano
  plot chart showing the distribution of the DEGs in TCGA and GEO datasets. Upregulated
  genes are red; downregulated genes are green. (b) The expression level of ADAMDEC1
  mRNA using RT‐PCR in NSCLC and normal tissues (n = 84); (c) The ADAMDEC1 protein
  expression level was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues compared with adjacent
  normal tissues in selected 16 paired tissues. (d) ADAMDEC1 protein expression in
  NSCLC tissues and adjacent tissues (n = 16); (e) Representative images of ADAMDEC1
  IHC staining of 84 patients in NSCLC and normal tissues (×400, scale bar 100 μm),
  respectively. (f) Overall survival curves for two groups defined by low and high
  expression of ADAMDEC1 in NSCLC patients. All results were representative of three
  separate experiments. **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001
article_title: Upregulation of ADAMDEC1 correlates with tumor progression and predicts
  poor prognosis in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
