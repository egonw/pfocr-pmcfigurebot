caption: AKG decarboxylation rate versus isocitrate decarboxylation rate. The points
  fall along a line with a slope close to 1, but the data are scattered and few. The
  y-axis intercept corresponds to an isocitrate decarboxylation rate of 3.1 when AKG
  decarboxylation is zero and the TCA pathway is completely open. The remaining flux
  of isocitrate to AKG is decarboxylated, from AKG to succinate, in a partly closed
  TCA cycle.
