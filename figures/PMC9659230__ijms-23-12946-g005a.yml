caption: (Aâ€“D) The Interferon signaling pathway in human PBMCs. The interferon signaling
  pathway plays a critical role in the amplification of the immune response. The STAT1
  and STAT2 transcription factors play a major role in the transcription of interferon
  activated genes. (A). RES, (B). LEC10, (C). LPS, and (D). LPS + RES. LPS and LEC
  activates gene expression of STAT1/STAT2, while RES downregulates it. Green, red,
  and grey colors denote inhibition, activation, and no change in gene expression,
  respectively.
