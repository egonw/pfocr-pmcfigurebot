caption: The correlation network of key structural genes, transcription factors and
  metabolites in the fructose metabolic pathway of loquat. 7 highly expressed structural
  genes related to fructose metabolism are located in the middle of the circle. 23
  transcription factors and 7 saccharides related to fructose metabolism are located
  in the outer and inner circle, respectively.
article_title: Multi-omics analysis provides new insights into the changes of important
  nutrients and fructose metabolism in loquat bud sport mutant.
