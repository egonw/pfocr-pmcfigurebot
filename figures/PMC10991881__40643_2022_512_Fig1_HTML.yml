caption: Vitamin A biosynthesis. a Biosynthesis of retinal and its conversion to other
  retinoids. BCDO, β-carotene 15,15ʹ-dioxygenase; BCMO, β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase;
  ACO, apo-carotenoid 15,15′-oxygenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; SDR, short-chain
  dehydrogenase/reductase; AKR, aldo-keto reductase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase. b
  Vitamin A biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. The biosynthetic pathway starts
  from the endogenous mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway, extended by a β-carotene synthetic
  pathway module consisting of CrtE03M, CrtYB and CrtI from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous
  and the vitamin A formation module containing the Halobacterium sp. β-carotene dioxygenase
  gene BLH and the retinal reductase genes (ybbO from E. coli and ENV9 from S. cerevisiae).
  The major competing branches for the key precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
  include the ergosterol synthetic pathway and the phosphatase-catalyzed formation
  of farnesol. Diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase gene DPP1 and lipid phosphate
  phosphatase gene LPP1 were knocked out and used as integration sites. The exogenous
  enzymes introduced are shown in green, the endogenous enzymes are depicted in orange
  and those deleted are depicted in gray. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA;
  FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; tHmg1, truncated
  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl reductase; CrtE, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase;
  CrtI, phytoene desaturase; CrtYB, phytoene synthase/ lycopene cyclase; Blh, bacterirhodopsin-related-protein-like
  homolog protein (later identified as β-carotene dioxygenase); ybbO, aldehyde reductase;
  tPos5, truncated NADH kinase
