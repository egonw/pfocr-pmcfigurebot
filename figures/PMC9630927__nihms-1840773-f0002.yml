caption: '(A) Gene expression profiling from microarray analysis of untreated Casp8−/−Ripk3−/−
  and Ripk3−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The top up- and downregulated
  REACTOME pathways identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) are shown.(B)
  Enrichment plot of the interferon alpha beta signaling pathway from analysis of
  publicly available colon tissue RNA-seq data from Vil1-cre × Casp8fl/fl and Casp8fl/fl
  mice (GEO: GSE137281).(C) Immunoblots of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) and total
  STAT1 (tSTAT1) from untreated BMDMs from indicated genotypes.(D) IFNβ concentration
  in the overnight culture supernatant from untreated BMDMs.(E) Immunoblots of pSTAT1
  and tSTAT1 from untreated or anti-IFNAR1 antibody-treated (10 μg/mL for 12 h) BMDMs.(F
  and G) BMDMs were untreated or primed with IFNβ (100 ng/mL) for 1 h, then infected
  with murine norovirus (MNV-1; multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 10) in vitro.(F)
  Real-time cell death monitored by Sytox Green staining and quantification.(G) Representative
  images of cell death from indicated genotypes at 20 h post-infection (hpi). Scale
  bar: 50 μm. Red mask denotes dead Sytox Green-positive cells.(H) Immunoblots of
  the MNV-1 antigen (MNV cp) in BMDMs of indicated genotypes at indicated hpi (MOI
  = 10).(I and J) BMDMs were infected with MNV-1 (MOI = 10) in vitro.(I) Real-time
  cell death monitored by Sytox Green staining and quantification.(J) Representative
  images of cell death from indicated genotypes at 20 hpi. Scale bar: 50 μm.Mean +
  SEM shown (D, F, and I). (D) ***p < 0.001 (one-way ANOVA); (F and I) ****p < 0.0001
  (two-way ANOVA). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data are representative
  of at least three independent experiments (C–J). Molecular weight markers are indicated
  on the right side of blots. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery
  rate.'
