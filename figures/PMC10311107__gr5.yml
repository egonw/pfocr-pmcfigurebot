caption: Expression changes of genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis in the
  stems of Dendrobium nobile. Red letters represent up-regulated expression (FDR were
  < 0.5 and fold change were ≥ 1.5), green letters represent down-regulated expression
  (FDR were < 0.5 and fold change were ≤ -1.5),and black letters represent no significant
  change in metabolite accumulation and gene expression. The orange box and letters
  indicate a pathway. Heatmaps show the level of increase and decrease of enzyme gene
  expression. Color scale on the top left represented normalized values of FPKM values
  and six boxes of each enzyme gene represented three biological replicates of DnS1
  and DnS2, respectively. SPS, sucrose-phosphate synthase; SPP, sucrose-6-phosphatase;
