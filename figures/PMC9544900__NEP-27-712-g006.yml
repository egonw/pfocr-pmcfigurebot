caption: Peptide 17 regulates Hippo/YAP signalling, inflammatory markers. Fibrosis
  markers and Ang II in kidney tissue of SHRs. (A) mRNA levels of YAP, LATS1, TNF‐α,
  MPC1, TGF‐β1, IL‐1β, Fibronectin, and CTGF in the kidney tissue of rats from different
  groups. (B) Bands of western blot analysis of protein expression. (C) Densitometry
  analysis of bands from the western blot analysis showing quantitative representation
  of gene expression. (D) Determination of Ang II content in the kidney tissue of
  different rat groups. *p < .05, **p < .01 compared with the WKY group; the significance
  of the comparisons between other groups are also indicated in the figure. The results
  were obtained from six rats/group
