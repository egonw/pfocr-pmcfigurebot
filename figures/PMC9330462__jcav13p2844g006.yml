caption: Effect of LINC00460 knockdown on activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in RCC cell
  lines. (A) Hierarchically clustered heatmap of the upregulated and downregulated
  genes in 786-O cells after shLINC00460 and shCtrl transfections. (B) Pathway classification
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Bubble plots represented the number of
  DEGs, x axis represented rich factor, y axis represented the functional classification
  of KEGG. (C, D, E, F) The Western blot assay was used to detect PI3K, AKT, p-AKT,
  mTOR and p-mTOR expression in cells transfection with shLINC00460 or overexpressed
  LINC00460 as relative to the control groups. (GAPDH as negative control, *p < 0.05,
  *** p<0.001).
