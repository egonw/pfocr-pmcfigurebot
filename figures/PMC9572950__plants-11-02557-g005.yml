caption: Monoterpene and diterpene volatile clustering patterns based on correlation
  types and connectivity. (a) HCA and heat map analysis of volatile metabolites of
  the MEP pathway. (b) The correlations between cluster I and cluster II metabolites
  of the MEP pathway. The red dashed lines represent a significant positive correlation;
  the black dashed lines represent a significant negative correlation. (c) Proposed
  MEP synthesis pathway.
