caption: NBD combined with FMT up-regulated tight junction protein expression in colitic
  rats. (A,B) The expression of occludin (A) and ZO-1 (B) mRNA was down-regulated
  in the DSS group but up-regulated by NBD combined with FMT, n = 6. (C) Western blotting
  indicated that NBD combined with FMT elevated the protein expression of occludin
  and ZO-1 beyond that in DSS-induced rats with UC, n = 3. (D) Representative images
  of DAPI (blue), occludin and ZO-1 immunostaining (red) in colonic sections (× 200
  magnification). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
article_title: New Baitouweng decoction combined with fecal microbiota transplantation
  alleviates DSS-induced colitis in rats by regulating gut microbiota metabolic homeostasis
  and the STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway.
