caption: MTX-211 exerts antitumor effects by modulating glutathione (GSH) metabolism.
  (A,B) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between MTX-211- and DMSO-treated 5637 cells. (C)
  The heatmap of GSH metabolism gene set in MTX-211- and DMSO-treated groups. (D,E)
  The effect of treatment with different concentrations of MTX-211 for 48 h on the
  relative level of GSH and the relative ratio of GSH/GSH disulfide (GSSG) in 5637
  and EJ cells. (F,G) The supplementation of GSH partially blocked the inhibitory
  effect of MTX-211 in 5637 and EJ cells. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
