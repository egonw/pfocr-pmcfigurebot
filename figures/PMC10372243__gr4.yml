caption: Tumor growth curves in xenograft mice (Nor-normal group, Mod-model group,
  Ori-oridonin group). A. Changes in body weights of mice. Over time, mouse body weight
  gradually increased, but the average body weight of the oridonin group was lower
  than that of the model group (Mod vs. Ori group. P = 0.0087). B. Mouse tumor volume
  also gradually increased in both groups, but the overall growth rate was significantly
  lower in the oridonin group (Mod vs. Ori. P = 0.0065). C, Tumor quality after two
  weeks of was significantly lower in the oridonin group than in the untreated mice
  (Mod vs. Ori group. **P < 0.01).
