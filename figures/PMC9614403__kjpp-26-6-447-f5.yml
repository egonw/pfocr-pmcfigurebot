figure_title: Arctigenin-induced FaDu pharyngeal carcinoma cell death is meditated
  by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
caption: (A) Extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway induced
  by Arctigenin. Arctigenin upregulated the expression level of the death receptor
  ligand Fas and subsequently activated the extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic
  signaling pathway through the cleavage of caspase-8 in FaDu cells. (B) Intrinsic
  mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling pathway induced by Arctigenin. Arctigenin
  downregulated anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL associated with the intrinsic
  mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and upregulated the mitochondria-dependent
  pro-apoptotic factors Bax and Bad in FaDu cells. (C) Extrinsic death receptor-mediated
  and intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis signaling pathways via the activation
  of caspase-3 and PARP induced by Arctigenin. Cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-9
  induced the activation of caspase-3 and PARP in FaDu cells treated with Arctigenin.
