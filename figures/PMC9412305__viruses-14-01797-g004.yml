caption: Overview of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The mitochondrial
  (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis is activated by various cellular stresses (e.g.,
  DNA damage, ER stress, ROS production, viral infection), resulting in mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of cytochrome c, triggering
  formation of the apoptosome and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 then cleaves
  and activates the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7, leading to apoptosis. The
  death receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis is stimulated by the binding of
  death receptor ligands (e.g., TNF, TRAIL, FASL) to their cognate death receptor
  and results in activation of the initiator caspase caspase-8. Under conditions of
  low levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP, which inhibits caspase-9,
  -3, -7, caspase-8 can directly cleave caspase-3. Under high XIAP conditions, caspase-8
  must cleave the pro-apoptotic protein Bid to form tBid, which translocates to the
  mitochondria to stimulate MOMP by Bax/Bak. MOMP results in the release of SMAC,
  an inhibitor of XIAP, allowing for activation of caspases-9, -3, -7 []. Created
