caption: Exploring the effects of candidate circular RNAs (circRNA) on CVB5 infections
  and mRNAs associated with enriched pathways. (A) Western blot assay of CVB5 VP1
  expression in RD cells overexpressing novel_circ_0002006; (B) RT-qPCR detection
  of the expression of mRNAs related to IFN signaling pathway; (C) Western blot assay
  of CVB5 VP1 expression in RD cells overexpressing novel_circ_0001066; (D) RT-qPCR
  detection of the expression of mRNAs associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Data are representative of three independent experiments with similar results (B,D)
  and shown as mean ± SD, n = 3 biologically independent experiments (B,D). Ns, not
  significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001, two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t test.
