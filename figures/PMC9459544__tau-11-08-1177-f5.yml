caption: 'AS-IV relieved renal cell apoptosis and regulated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
  in the I/R-induced CKD model. (A) Apoptosis in the renal tissues of the CKD rats
  as determined by TUNEL staining. Magnification ×400. (B,C) Nrf2 and HO-1 were detected
  by IHC. Magnification ×400. Bcl-2, Bax, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression in kidney tissues
  was evaluated by qRT-PCR (D-G) and western blotting (H-L). ##P<0.01 compared to
  the sham operation group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 compared to the I/R group. AS-IV, Astragaloside
  IV; I/R, ischemia-reperfusion; CKD, chronic kidney disease; qRT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction.'
article_title: Astragaloside IV protects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced
  kidney injury based on the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.
