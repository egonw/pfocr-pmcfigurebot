caption: Summary of pathway analysis with MetaboAnalyst. (A) MetaboAnalyst analysis
  of the KEGG metabolic library. Both the overrepresentation of altered metabolites
  within the pathway and the impact of the changed metabolites on the function of
  the pathway through alterations in critical junction points of the pathway were
  assessed. Results of each of the 45 KEGG pathways are simultaneously plotted to
  show the most significant pathways in terms of hypergeometric test P value [vertical
  axis as âˆ’log(P), shades of red] and impact (horizontal axis, circle diameter). (B)
  Eleven pathways of metabolic variations after DHA treatment in SH-SY5Y cells. KEGG,
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; DHA, dihydroartemisinin; FDR, false discovery
  rate.
