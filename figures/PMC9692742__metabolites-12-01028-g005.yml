caption: 'Effects of 6-shogaol on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and the expression
  of MLCK protein in Caco-2 cells treated with PA: (A) Representative immunoblotting
  of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB; (B) Relative expression of TLR4; (C) Relative
  expression of MyD88; (D) The p-NF-κB/NF-κB ratio; € Representative immunoblotting
  of MLCK; (F) Relative expression of MLCk. β-Actin was used as the loading control
  for the quantification of TLR4, MyD88, and MLCK. Data are given as means ± standard
  deviations (n = 3). ns indicates no significant difference between the 6-shogaol-treated
  group and the control at p < 0.05.'
