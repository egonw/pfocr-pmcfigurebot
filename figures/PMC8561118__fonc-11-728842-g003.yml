caption: Construction of immune cell infiltration (ICI) score model. (A) Alluvial
  diagram of patient distribution. (B) ICI scores of patients in different subgroups
  (mean ± SD, Kruskal–Wallis test, *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001). (C) Immune-checkpoint
  associated genes (PDCD1, HAVCR2, CTLA4, CD274, and LAG3) and (D) immune-activity
  associated genes (CXCL9, GZMB, TNF, CD8A, TBX2, CXCL10, GZMA, PRF1, and IFNG) expressed
  in ICI high and low groups (mean ± SD, Kruskal–Wallis test, *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001).
  (E) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that calcium signaling pathway, leukocyte
  transendothelial migration pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, TGF β pathway, and Wnt
  signaling pathway were enriched in high ICI score group. (F) Base excision repair
  pathway, cell cycle pathway, homologous recombination pathway, mismatch repair pathway,
  and nucleotide excision repair pathway were enriched in low ICI score group. (G)
  Overall survival of colon cancer patients in ICI high and low groups in the Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (log-rank test, p = 0.017). (H) Overall survival of colon
  cancer patients in ICI high and low groups in the total patient cohort (log-rank
  test, p = 0.002; ns, non significant).
