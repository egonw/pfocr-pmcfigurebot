caption: 'I34 induced Sf9 cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial signaling pathway.
  (A) The enzyme activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were measured, respectively.
  (B) The mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes was detected by quantitative
  reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). (C) The Western blot
  analysis was used to verify the expression of apoptosis-related proteins of I34
  treatment for different times. (D) The gray-level statistical analysis of picture
  (C). Columns: different letters indicate a significant difference, mean of three
  experiments, data are presented as mean ± S.D.'
