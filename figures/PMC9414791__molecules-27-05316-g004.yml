caption: 'Protective effect of 80% ethanolic extract from Gimcheon 1ho (GC) cultivar
  walnut (Juglans regia) in HFD-induced mice: (a) fasting glucose; (b) oral glucose
  tolerance test (OGTT) at 19 weeks old; (c) area under the curve (AUC) of OGTT. Results
  shown are mean ± SD (n = 5). Data are statistically represented with * = significantly
  different from the NC group, and # = significantly different from PM group; * and
  # p < 0.05, ** and ##p < 0.01. Bold line indicates mean.'
