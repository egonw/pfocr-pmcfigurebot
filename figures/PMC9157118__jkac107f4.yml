caption: 'The repressive effects of vitamin B12 on srh-234 expression are reversed
  by propionate accumulation. a) Schematic of the C. elegans vitamin B12-dependent
  methionine/SAMs cycle, the vitamin B12-dependent canonical propionate breakdown
  pathway, and the propionate shunt pathway independent of vitamin B12. Genes shown
  are: metr-1/MTR (methionine synthase), pcca-1/PCCA and pccb-1/PCCB (2 members of
  the propionyl-CoA carboxylase complex), mmcm-1/MCM (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase), acdh-1/ACADSB
  (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and hphd-1/ADHFE1 (3-hydroxypropionate-oxoacid transhydrogenase).
  b) Relative expression of srh-234 in the ADL cell body of adults fed an E. coli
  OP50 diet supplemented with excess propionate (40 mM final concentration) and/or
  Me-Cbl (64 nM final concentration). Data are represented as the mean ± SEM (n =
  24–42 animals for each condition). A 1-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple-comparisons
  test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences vs wild-type
  animals fed E. coli OP50, with brackets indicating statistical differences between
  2 specific diet conditions. ns, not significant, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. c–e)
  Relative expression of srh-234 in the ADL cell body of adult animals with mutations
  in the canonical propionate breakdown pathway (c), the propionate shunt breakdown
  pathway (d), and the methionine/SAM cycle (e) fed E. coli OP50 with or without exogenous
  vitamin B12 (Me-Cbl, 64 nM), or Comamonas aq. DA1877. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SEM. n > 18 animals for each diet and genotype. c–e) The Kruskal–Wallis with
  Dunn multiple-comparisons test was used to determine the statistical significance
  of differences vs wild-type animals fed E. coli OP50, with brackets indicating statistical
  differences between 2 specific genotypes and conditions. ns, not significant, *P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. b–e) Representative cropped images of srh-234p::GFP
  expression in the ADL cell body of adults. Images were acquired at the same exposure
  time for comparison.'
