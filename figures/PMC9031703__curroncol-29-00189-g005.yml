caption: Mechanism of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in cancer. The tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor
  becomes activated by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines, which activates the
  p85 subunit, Ras and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). As a result, GSK-3β
  becomes inhibited, which further activates the mTORC1 complex and thus manifests
  the hallmarks of cancer. This illustration was created using resources available
  at www.biorender.com (accessed on 25 September 2021).
