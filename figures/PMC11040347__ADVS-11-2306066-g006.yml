caption: 'EC‐sourced lactate polarizes Mψ to the mixed M1/M2‐like phenotype by inducing
  glycolysis. A) The metabolic pathway activity analysis of EC clusters. The circle
  size and color darkness both represent the scaled metabolic score. B) mIHC of CD31+MYC+
  ECs and key glycolytic enzymes (PKM and PFKFB3). Scale bar: 20 µm. C) The UMAP plot
  shows the subpopulation of Mψ between groups. D) Histogram showing the proportion
  of each cluster between groups. E) The MIA map of Mψ clusters and ST‐defined regions.
  F) mIHC of F4/80+MMP12+ Mψ. Scale bar: 50 µm. The white arrows represent the F4/80+MMP12+
  Mψ, and the quantification of F4/80+MMP12+ Mψ is shown (n = 4 mice per group; One‐way
  ANOVA with Tukey''s test, p = 8.41 × 10−4, 1.59 × 10−3 and 1.72 × 10−3 from left
  to right). G) mIHC of CD31+MYC+ ECs and F4/80+MMP12+ Mψ. Scale bar: 20 µm. H) Representative
  intravital images of Mψ polarization by DAOSLIMIT. The white arrows represent the
  CD80+CD163+ Mψ. Scale bar: 50 µm. I) Pathway enrichment analysis of Mψ clusters.
  GSVA was used to perform the pathway enrichment analysis (Methods). Only selected
  pathways were shown. J) Multiplex fluorescence of F4/80+MMP12+ kupffer cells and
  key glycolytic enzymes (PKM and PFKFB3). Scale bar: 50 µm. The mouse primary kupffer
  cells were treated with or without LSEC‐CM for 24 h. K) Quantification of F4/80+MMP12+PKM+PFKFB3+
  kupffer cells for multiplex fluorescence as shown in J (n = 4 samples per group;
  two‐sided Student''s t‐test, p = 3.63 × 10−3). L) Representative H&E staining and
  mIHC of CD31+MYC+ ECs and F4/80+MMP12+ Mψ. Scale bar: 50 µm. Pkm f/f and Cdh5 crePkm
  f/+ mice were administrated with APAP for 24 h (n = 4 mice per group). M) Representative
  H&E staining and mIHC of CD31+MYC+ ECs, F4/80+MMP12+ Mψ, and CCR2+ monocytes. Scale
  bar: 50 µm. Mas1 −/− mice were administrated with or without 3PO under APAP challenge
  (n = 4 mice per group). In all graphs, data are presented as mean ± SD, **p < 0.01.'
