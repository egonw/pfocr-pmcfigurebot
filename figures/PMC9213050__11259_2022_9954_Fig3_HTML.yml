caption: TLR2 is involved in apoptosis induced by PPV1 infection. PK-15 cells were
  infected with PPV1 at MOI of 1 and transfected with siRNA (150 pmol) or siNegative
  (150 pmol) as indicated. At 36 hpi, the percentage of apoptotic cells was detected
  by flow cytometry analysis using an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit. Results
  are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *0.01 < p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01
article_title: TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in PPV1-induced apoptosis
  in PK-15 cells.
