caption: Glutamine levels are positively correlated with aggressive clinical characteristics
  in pancreatic cancer. A Kaplan‒Meier overall survival curve for patients with pancreatic
  cancer divided by baseline serum CA19-9 levels. CA19-9-low, ≤ 37 U/mL, 224 cases;
  CA19-9–9-high, > 37 U/mL, 844 cases. B The serum concentration of CA19-9 for patients
  with pancreatic cancer categorized using the American Joint Committee on Cancer
  8th staging system. C Quantification of amino acid concentration by UHPLC‒MS/MS
  in resected pancreatic cancers stratified by serum CA19-9 level (low, ≤ 37 U/mL,
  37 cases; high, > 37 U/mL, 66 cases). UHPLC–MS/MS, ultrahigh-performance liquid
  chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. D, E Heatmap of amino acids in pancreatic
  cancers, tissue adjacent to pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
  detected by UHPLC‒MS/MS (D). Values are the log 10 transformed of the concentration
  of amino acids. Quantification of glutamine concentration in pancreatic cancer, tissue
  adjacent to pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (5 cases for
  each group, E) are shown. F, G Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
  images of primary pancreatic cancers and their matched liver metastases (6 cases,
  F). Quantification of glutamine concentration in primary pancreatic cancers and
  their matched liver metastases (G). H, I Representative H&E staining images of primary
  pancreatic cancers with (36 cases) or without (57 cases, H) lymphovascular invasion.
  Quantification of glutamine concentration in resected pancreatic cancer stratified
  by vascular invasion status (I). Scale bars, 50 μm. Data represent the mean ± s.e.m.,
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001
