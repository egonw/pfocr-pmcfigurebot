caption: 'Limonene yield in transgenic algae. (a) Strains were grown under constant
  (24 h) light (L) or 16:8 h light: dark cycles (LA) conditions. Strains were cultivated
  in 500 mL shake flasks containing a 300 mL TAP medium supplemented with 15 mM isoprenol
  at 25 °C and 120 rpm under constant (24 h) light or 16:8 h light: dark cycles, and
  using 5 mL dodecane as overlay for 5 d. (b) Strains were cultivated in 500 mL shake
  flasks containing a 300 mL TAP or opt2 medium supplemented with 15 mM isoprenol
  at 25°C and 120 rpm under constant (24 h) light, and using 5 mL dodecane as a solvent
  overlay for 5 d. Strains were cultivated in 500 mL shake flasks containing a 300
  mL TAP medium supplemented with 10 mM isoprenol at 25°C and 120 rpm under 16:8 h
  light: dark conditions using 5 mL dodecane as a extraction overlay for 1, 2, 3,
  4, 5, 6 or 7 d (c) or using 5, 10, 15 or 20 mL dodecane (d) for 7 d. (e) Strains
  were cultivated in 500 mL shake flasks containing a 300 mL TAP medium supplemented
  with 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 mM isoprenol at 25 °C and 120 rpm under 16:8 h light: dark
  conditions, and using 5 mL dodecane as an extraction solvent for 5 d. Three biological
  replicates were used to calculate the limonene yield averages and SDs. Statistical
  significance (one-way ANOVA) compared to 0 mM isoprenol is represented by asterisks
  (** indicates a difference at the p ≤ 0.01 level and * indicates a difference at
  the p ≤ 0.05 level).'
