caption: Activation of FGFR1c by FGF21 and signaling pathway (). FGF21 receptor consists
  of FGFR1c and co-receptor β-Klotho that are constitutively associated with the plasma
  membrane. The C-terminus of FGF21 interacts with β-Klotho, and β-Klotho is necessary
  for FGF21 to perform the function. Then, the N-terminus of FGF21 binds to FGFR to
  form a stable FGF21/β-Klotho/FGFR complex and leads to autophosphorylation of FGFR1,
  and phosphorylation of FRS2, which then forms a complex with Grb2/Sos to activate
  downstream molecular signals, such as Akt pathway, MAPK/p38 pathway, MAPK/ERK pathway,
  and NF-κB pathway, causing the change of target genes in the nucleus. FGF21, fibroblast
  growth factor 21; FGFR, FGF receptor; Akt, protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase after FGF receptor.
