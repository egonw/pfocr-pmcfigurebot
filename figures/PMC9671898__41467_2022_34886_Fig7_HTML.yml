figure_title: A hypothetical model for blue-light regulation of thermosensory flowering
  via the CRY2–CIS1–FLM signaling pathway
caption: At low ambient temperatures without blue light, CRY2 is inactive, CIS1 protein
  is unstable, the 3ʹ splice site of the second FLM intron is a weak AS site because
  of the G tract sequence, leading to more accumulation of FLM β. When there is blue
  light, CIS1 protein is stabilized; photoexcited CRY2 forms homodimers and interacts
  with CIS1 to promote its binding to intron 2 or exon 3 in the FLM pre-RNA. CIS1
  also interacts with SF1 and U2AF65A to recruit U2-snRNP to promote the accumulation
  of non-FLM β including FLM δ and other FLM variants (oFLM).
