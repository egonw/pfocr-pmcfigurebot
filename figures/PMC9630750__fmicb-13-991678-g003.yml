caption: Schematic representation of the interorgan communication during infection
  in Drosophila melanogaster. In response to ingested pathogens, these microorganisms
  might either break the gut epithelium themselves or release peptidoglycan (PGN)
  from their cell walls into the hemolymph. The enterocytes (ECs) are also able to
  release reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to tissue damage. These circulating
  signals are sensed by the hemocytes located close to the gut epithelium. Hemocyte-expressed
  Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Unpaireds (Upds) during early stages of the infection
  activate the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation to cope with tissue damage.
  Hemocytes-derived Upds also induce accumulation of the transcription factor dFOXO
  in the fat body via JAK/STAT pathway. Activation of dFOXO induces expression of
  AMPs and a systemic metabolic dysregulation that mobilizes energy resourced toward
  phagocytic cells. Finally, infection-induced Upd3 in enterocytes activate the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway in visceral muscles (VM), which in turns promote ISCs proliferation,
  as well as activation of the close-located hemocytes.
