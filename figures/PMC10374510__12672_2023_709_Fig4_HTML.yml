caption: The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway was responsible for regulating glucose metabolism
  mediated by GPR81 in BC. The underlying molecular mechanisms for glycolytic reprogramming
  mediated by GPR81 in BC were detected by western blotting assay. A With sufficient
  glucose in the culture medium, inhibited activation of Hippo signaling with a decreased
  level of p-LATS1 and p-YAP was induced by downregulation of GPR81, and control T47D
  cells (GPR81-ncRNA) with lactate treatment was found to be with enhanced activation
  of Hippo signaling reflected by increased levels of p-LATS1 and p-YAP. B Whereas,
  for MDA-MB-231 cells, the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 (p-LATS1) and YAP (p-YAP)
  was remarkably increased in MDA-MB-231 cells with downregulation of GPR81 expression
  (GPR81-shRNA) compared to that in control MDA-MB-231 cells (GPR81-ncRNA), indicating
  enhanced activation of Hippo signaling induced by downregulation of GPR81. In addition,
  lactate treatment for control MDA-MB-231 cells (GPR81-ncRNA) resulted in attenuated
  activation of Hippo signaling which was reflected by decreased phosphorylation levels
  of LATS1 and YAP. A representative immunoblotting profile was shown on the upper,
  and the ratios of phosphorylated proteins to total proteins which were used to evaluate
  the degree of activation, were summarized based on results from three independent
  experiments (lower). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
