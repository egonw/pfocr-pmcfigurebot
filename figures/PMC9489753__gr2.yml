caption: The role of macrophages and NK cells in LPLC-induced regeneration. Macrophages
  can not only promote the proliferation of LPLCs through TWEAK signaling but also
  induce the differentiation of LPLCs into hepatocytes via Wnt3a pathway. Ly-6Chigh
  monocytes will promote tissue injury by secreting IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12, whereas
  Ly-6Clow monocytes can suppress inflammation and facilitate liver repair by secreting
  IL-10, TGFβ1, IL-4, IL-13, and VEGFα. LPLCs can induce the recruitment of infiltrating
  macrophages to the damaged liver through CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1. Macrophages
  can also influence other immune cells, including NK cells, through complex cell-cell
  interactions and secretion of cytokines. NK cells play a beneficial role in LPLCs
  proliferation, and CXCL7 secreted by NK cells can induce the recruitment of mesenchymal
  stem cells, thereby improving liver regeneration. Also, IL-22 produced by NK cells
  and NKT cells can increase HSCs senescence via STAT3 activation, thus alleviating
  liver fibrosis. CCL2, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; CCR2, C-C motif chemokine receptor
  2; CXCL7, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 7; CX3CL1, C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand
  1; CX3CR1, C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1; IFN-γ, interferon γ; IL, interleukin;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides; NK cell, natural killer cell; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; TGFβ1, transforming growth factor β-1; TNFα, tumor
  necrosis factor α; VEGFα, vascular endothelial growth factor α.
