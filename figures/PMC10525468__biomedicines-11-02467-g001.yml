caption: 'Effects of stem cell treatment and roles of related signaling pathways on
  IDD progression. Red module: positive relations between the activations of signaling
  pathway and corresponding biological processes. Blue module: negative relations
  between the activations of signaling pathway and corresponding biological processes.
  Yellow module: relations between the activations of signaling pathways and corresponding
  biological processes varied in different studies. Grey module: lack of relevant
  evidence. (The figure was created with Figdraw and the OmicStudio tools at https://www.omicstudio.cn
