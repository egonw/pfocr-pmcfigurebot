caption: Effect of combined IgPKD1 and PI3K inhibitor treatment on mTOR signalling
  pathway in Trigonocephaly (T) and Dolichocephaly (D) cranial cells. (A and B) Western
  blot analysis and quantitative data from cell lysates of T cranial cells using p‐mTOR,
  p‐AKT and p‐4EBP1 antibodies. (C and D) Western blot analysis and quantitative data
  from cell lysates of D cranial cells using p‐mTOR, p‐AKT and p‐4EBP1 antibodies.
  Actin was used as a protein loading control. Representative Western blots of each
  cell line are presented. All data were analysed by t‐test and represent the mean ± SD.
  The experiments have been performed in triplicate (Student's t‐test, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
