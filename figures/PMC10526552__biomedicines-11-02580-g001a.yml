caption: Induction of HO-1 in human PDAC cells upon treatment with ATO. (A) The effect
  of ATO on HO-1 expression was examined through Western blot analysis in PDAC cells
  MiaPaca-1 and Capan-1. Cells were treated with different concentrations of ATO for
  24 h. Protein was collected and run for immunoblotting as described in the . Densitometric
  analysis is shown next to each blot (n = 3, p < 0.05). (B) Increased HO-1 expression
  after ATO treatment in Colo-357 shown by immunoblotting. Confocal microscopy confirms
  ATO induction of HO-1 in Colo-357. (C) HO-1 upregulation is via activation of the
  p38 MAPK pathway in response to ATO. MiaPaca-2 and Capan-1 cells were treated with
  indicated concentrations of ATO to follow pp38 MAPK and HO-1 expression using Western
  blot analysis. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (** p <
  0.01, **** p < 0.0001. n = 3).
