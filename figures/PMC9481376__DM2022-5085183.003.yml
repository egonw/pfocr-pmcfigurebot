caption: 'Overexpression of SPAG5 potentiated UV irradiation-mediated dysfunction
  of keratinocytes. (a) Vectors and SPAG5 overexpression plasmids were transfected
  into HaCaT cells, and the SPAG5 expression in HaCaT cells was assayed by RT-PCR
  24 hours later. The transfected HaCaT cells were irradiated with UV and then treated
  with curcumin (5 μM) for 24 hours. (b) CCK-8 was applied to check the proliferation
  of UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. (c)–(f) Levels of SOD, GSH-PX, MDA, and ROS in UV-irradiated
  HaCaT cells were assessed using an oxidative stress assay kit and cytofluorimetry.
  (g) ELISA tested the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and
  TNFα in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. (h)–(j) WB was conducted to investigate the profiles
  of apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax, Bcl-xL, Caspase3, Caspase8, Caspase9), oxidative
  stress-associated proteins (Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, COX2, iNOS), and inflammatory response
  proteins (NF-κB, MMP1, MMP). (k) The expression of the SPAG5/FOXM1 pathway in UV-irradiated
  HaCaT cells was estimated by WB. N = 3. ∗p < 0.05 (vs. vector or UV group), ∗∗p
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; #p < 0.05 (vs. SPAG5+UV group), ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.'
