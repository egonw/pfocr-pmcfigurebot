caption: Functional gene screening and functional verification. (A) GSEA-KEGG analysis
  of the transcriptome. A pathway of positive enrichment score is up-regulated, whereas
  a pathway of negative enrichment score is down-regulated. (B) Gene expression heatmap
  of the fatty acid metabolic pathway. The color key (from blue to red) of abundance
  value indicated low to high expression levels. (C) Gene expression levels quantified
  by RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. HACD2, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2. HSD17B4, hydroxysteroid
  17-beta dehydrogenase 4. The data are expressed as mean Â± SD. * p < 0.05.
