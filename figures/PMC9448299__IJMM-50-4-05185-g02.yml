caption: Screening and identification of angiogenesis-related genes regulated by ZNF667.
  (A) RNA-seq was performed on HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-ZNF667.
  Candidate angiogenesis-related genes regulated by ZNF667 were then screened out.
  Schematic representation of consensus ZNF667 core sequence of the specific DNA binding
  sites (CTTA; red stars) in the promoter region of candidate angiogenesis-related
  genes. Arrowheads indicate the orientation of transcription. (B) ChIP assay was
  performed with cell lysates from HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-ZNF667.
  The chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP or normal IgG, which served as
  a negative control. The fold-change of precipitated genomic fragment containing
  ZNF667 binding site on the VASH1, VEGFA and PFKFB3 promoter was determined by reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR. The net quantities of enriched DNA were corrected
  with their corresponding input DNA. (C) The mRNA expression of VASH1 in HUVECs transfected
  with pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-ZNF667 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR (n=3 per group). (D) ZNF667 protein created a shift (lane 6, arrowed) in vitro.
  EMSA was then performed with 8 µg protein of cell nuclear extracts from hypoxia
  (1% O2, 48 h) stimulated cells. (E) The protein expression of VASH1 and ZNF667 in
  HUVECs transfected with pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-ZNF667 was detected by immunoblotting.
  (F) Quantification of immunoblot analysis of ZNF667 and VASH1 (n=3 per group). Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation. RNA-seq, RNA-sequencing; HUVEC, human
  umbilical vein endothelial cells; ZNF667, zinc finger protein 667; VASH1, vasohibin
  1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
