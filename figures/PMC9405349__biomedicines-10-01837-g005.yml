caption: ATF2 directly regulates GLUT3 transcription through TGF-β activation. (A)
  Lysates of the HCT116 cells treated or not with 10 μM SB505124 for 48 h. Western
  blot analysis was conducted for measuring the protein levels of TGF-β RI, GLUT3,
  p-ATF2, ATF2, p-JNK and JNK. (B) qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the mRNA levels
  of GLUT3 after being treated or not with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. (C) HCT116 cells
  were transiently transfected with GLUT3/pGL3 and ATF/CRE mutant GLUT3/pGL3 luciferase
  promoter plasmids for 24 h and treated or not with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. Cell
  extracts were harvested, and the luciferase assay was performed. (D) Effect of TGF-β
  activation on ATF2 binding to the GLUT3 chromatin. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated
  with antibodies against ATF2 or rabbit lgG and analyzed by RT-PCR using primers
  that flank the ATF/CRE binding site. ATF2, activating transcription factor-2; p-ATF2,
  phospho-ATF2; GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;
  TGF-β RI, transforming growth factor-β receptor I; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  p-JNK, phospho-JNK; CRE, cAMP-response element; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription
  PCR; IgG, immunoglobulin G. Data are the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
  significance was analyzed by analysis of variance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001, significantly different compared with control.
