caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of common DEGs. Bubble chart for KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis is presented. The x-axis represents the ratio of common DEGs
  enriched in the marked category. The size of the bubble indicates the number of
  common DEGs enriched in the marked category and color refers to the value of differences.
  The categories of ‘Focal adhesion’, ‘Hippo signaling pathway’ and ‘Renal cell carcinoma’
  were considered significant, while the categories of ‘Regulation of actin cytoskeleton’,
  ‘Melanoma’ and ‘Inflammatory bowel disease’ were considered not significant. DEG,
  differentially expressed genes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
