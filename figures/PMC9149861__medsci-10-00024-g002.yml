caption: The polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes are shown in bold. The polyamine
  biosynthetic enzymes are arginase (ARG), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), spermidine
  synthase (SPDSYN), and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (ADOMETDC), the latter
  depicted with prozyme. Downstream reactions are catalyzed by trypanothione synthetase/amidase
  (TSA), a bifunctional enzyme that forms trypanothione, and by deoxyhypusine synthase
  (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) that in consecutive reactions catalyze
  the hypusination and activation of eIF5A. The enzymes and metabolites unique to
  trypanosomatids, prozyme, TSA, and trypanothione, are shown in red, while the synthesis
  of spermine and the back-conversion of spermidine to putrescine, present only in
  mammalian cells and not in Leishmania, are denoted in green.
