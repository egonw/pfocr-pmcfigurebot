caption: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) promotes inflammatory
  response at 3 days after myocardial infarction (MI). (A) The immunofluorescence
  staining images of iNOS and CD68 in macrophages and the nuclei were counterstained
  with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). (B) The protein expression level of MCP1
  and CD86 in myocardial tissues in all groups of mice. a, b, c, d means sham, MI,
  MI+LV-shRNA-NC and MI+LV-shRNA-LAPTM5, respectively. Statistical evaluation was
  performed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test. Data were expressed
  as mean ± SD. **P<0.01. n=6 for each group.
article_title: Suppression of lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 ameliorates
  cardiac function and inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) pathway after myocardial infarction in mice.
