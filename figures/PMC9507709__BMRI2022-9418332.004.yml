caption: The effect of CORM-3 on the subcutaneous tumor growth of CAL27 cells in nude
  mice. (a) Images of the mice. (b) The body weights of the mice were measured twice
  a week for 5 weeks. (c) Images of the tumor specimens. (d) Tumor volumes were measured
  twice a week for 5 weeks. (e) The expression of Ki67 and HO-1 in the tumors was
  detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The IOD of Ki67 and HO-1 staining was
  quantitatively analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. (f) The protein expression
  of HO-1was detected by western blot in the tumors of nude mice. âˆ—P < 0.05 vs. the
  control group (n = 6).
