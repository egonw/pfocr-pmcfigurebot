caption: Engagement and subversion of mitochondrial recovery pathways during bacterial
  pathogen infection. (A) The MAVS pathway responds to viral and bacterial RNA via
  the RLR RIG-1, which associate with MAVS protein at the mitochondrial outer membrane
  once activated. The RIG-1/MAVS complex becomes ubiquitinated, leading to the activation
  of the immune response regulators IFR3 and NF-κB via the kinases TBK1 and IKKε.
  (B) The UPRmt is activated by toxins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, involving
  the translocation of ATFS-1 into the nucleus and the regulation of gene expression
  related to mitochondrial recovery and pathogen defense. P. aeruginosa also represses
  the UPRmt via its metabolic enzyme FadE2 through an unresolved mechanism. In addition,
  P. aeruginosa manipulates the host transcription factor ZIP-3 to repress UPRmt activity.
  (C) The ubiquitin ligase Parkin, involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria
  by mitophagy, mediates the removal of intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis. Parkin mediates the ubiquitination of M. tuberculosis, which marks
  it for delivery to the autophagosome and eventual degradation by the lysosome.
