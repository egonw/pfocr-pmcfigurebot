caption: ATL III regulated the differentially expressed genes and pathway enrichment
  analysis in the liver of BDL mice. (A) Heat map of the mRNA associated with liver
  fibrosis in various groups of mice. (B) Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq
  data from the model and ATL III groups. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (D)
  Enrichment GO. (E) GO annotation analysis showing the significant biological processes
  involved in the metabolic process of BDL mice treated with ATL III 50 mg/kg. n =
  3 per group.
