caption: 'The protein expression level of cleaved-PARP, GPX4, LC3B, and HMGB1 in PC3
  cells. (a) Representative bands. The protein expression levels of cleaved-PARP (b),
  GPX4 (c), LC3B (d), and HMGB1 (e) were normalized to those in the control-treated
  conditions. (f) PC3 cells were treated with IDOAMP in the absence or presence of
  the indicated inhibitors for 24 h, and then, cell viability was determined. The
  results are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). ##p < 0.01, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗p < 0.05
  vs. the control group.'
