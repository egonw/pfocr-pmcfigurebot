caption: 'miRNA and protein expressions annotated to immune system and metabolic processes
  in placenta. Normalised expressions of miRNAs with a z-score above zero and proteins
  are illustrated on a continuous scale from lowest expression (bluer smaller nodes)
  to highest expression (redder larger nodes) and the miRNA target links (edges) to
  gene products sorted with respect to their degree of edges. (A) All proteins expressed
  in at least 90% of placenta samples (structural proteins in  have been removed)
  are shown with focused annotations to immune system process (turquoise) and metabolic
  process (orange) gene ontologies and nervous system development (yellow border)
  reactome pathway, denoted by node colour. Majority of turquoise nodes are also annotated
  to metabolic process (not shown). (B) Proteins annotated to metabolic process further
  annotated to specific metabolic processes [Protein metabolic process (GO: 0019538),
  Lipid metabolic process (GO: 0006629), and Carbohydrate metabolic process (GO: 0005975)]
  shown within their respective Venn-circular areas. (C) Proteins annotated to immune
  system process further annotated to sub-immune processes [Inflammatory response
  (GO: 0006954), Innate immune response (GO: 0045087), and Adaptive immune response
  (GO: 0002250)] shown within their respective Venn-circular areas.'
