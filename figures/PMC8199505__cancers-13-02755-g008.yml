caption: 'Schematic diagram and experimental designs. Jak2 overexpression afforded
  drug resistance to cancer cells, specifically in HBV/HCV-infected HCC, and the inhibition
  of Jak2 by momelotinib (JAK2 inhibitor) effectively suppressed HCC. This cancer
  development process includes four stages: (A) HBV/HCV infection. (B) Virus-induced
  hepatocellular carcinoma. (C) Sorafenib treatment causes DNA damage and initiates
  the STAT1-PARP1 pathway for DNA repair, which then forms resistant/recurrent cancer
  cells. (D) Momelotinib inhibits the upstream pathway of IFNGR-JAK2-STAT1, inhibits
  the downstream STAT1-PARP1 DNA repair pathway, and causes cancer cell apoptosis.'
