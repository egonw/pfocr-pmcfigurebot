caption: '(A) Transmembrane α-helical segment topology of the most studied holin classes
  (I-III). (B) Schematic representation of canonical pathway: Following the late gene
  expression initiated in the bacteriophage lytic cycle, canonical holins and endolysins
  accumulate in the inner membrane and cytoplasm, respectively. At an allele-specific
  time, holins make micron-scale holes in the inner membrane and endolysins escape
  to the periplasm, degrading the peptidoglycan. (C) Schematic representation of pinholin
  pathway: When late gene expression is initiated, pinholins and inactive SAR endolysins
  accumulated in the inner membrane. At an allele-specific time, pinholins make heptameric
  channels with a lumen of ~2 nm which destabilised the proton motive pump. SAR endolysins
  transform into their active form as they are sensitive to the proton motive pump
  and finally degrade the peptidoglycan. (D) Topology of lambda and lambdoid bacteriophage
  ϕ21 holins (S105, S2168) and its antiholins (S107, S2171). (E) T4 holin complex
  can make a complex with its RI, RIII antiholins, and DNA to respond to superinfections.
