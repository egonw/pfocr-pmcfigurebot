figure_title: Molecular checkpoints of distorted autophagy pathways in lupus nephritis
caption: 'The process and main regulatory mechanisms of autophagy. The process of
  autophagy starts with cytoplasmic material being engulfed by double membranes with
  the formation of cup-like structure called the phagophore to the conversion into
  double membrane vesicles called the autophagosomes. The mTOR pathway and the AMP-
  activated Kinase (AMPK) are key determinants of autophagy activation. The process
  if finely regulated by autophagy-related proteins (ATG) that assemble into several
  complexes : Unc-51-Like Kinase (ULK1), PI3K nucleation complex and the phosphatidinol
  3 phosphate binding complex. Together, they direct the distribution of the autophagy
  machinery allowing the formation of the autophagosome. LC3 is cleaved into LC3-I
  by ATG4 which is then conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II. This
  complex gets incorporated into autophagosome and binds with receptors harboring
  LC3 containing motifs. Both macroautophagy and LC3-associated autophagy can impact
  mitophagy, of which is largely deficient in SLE, but dependent on the energy requirements
  of effector cell types.'
