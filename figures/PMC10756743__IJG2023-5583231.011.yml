caption: qRT-PCR data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. All statistical
  tests and graphs of qRT-PCR experiment were performed and visualized using that
  software. Relative expression analysis of qRT-PCR data revealed that THBS2, BAIAP2-AS1,
  TSIX, and LINC01215 have significant upregulation in GC samples, compared to control.
