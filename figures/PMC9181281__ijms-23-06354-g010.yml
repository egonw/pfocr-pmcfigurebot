caption: The possible mechanism of Artemisinin against neuroinflammation in AD. Aβ1–42
  stimulated microglial receptor TLR4 to activate the IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway,
  resulting in the massive expression of intracellular inflammatory factors (IL-6,
  TNF-α, IL-1β) and an increase in the level of ROS(COX2, iNOS). While Artemisinin
  pretreatment suppressed the activation of the TLR4/IκBα/NF-κB pathway and reduced
  the release of inflammatory factors, which in turn protects nerve cells from damage
  by improving the inflammatory environment in the brain.
