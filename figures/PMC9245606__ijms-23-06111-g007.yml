caption: 'HTR2A agonist promotes melanin synthesis and melanosome transport through
  the PKA/CREB signaling pathway: (a) Schematic diagram shows the classical signals
  involved in the initiation of melanogenesis and the process of melanin synthesis
  and melanin transfer to neighboring keratinocytes; (b) Western blot shows the protein
  expression of phospho-CREB and total CREB in B16F10 cells after treatment with DOI
  (30 μM) from 0–14 h; (c) relative melanin content in B16F10 cells treated with DOI
  (30 μM), H89 (the inhibitor of PKA signaling, 5 μM), and cotreatment as compared
  with the control (n = 3). The photos of melanin precipitation in the tube are at
  the top of the diagram (c); (d) Western blot shows the protein expression of MITF
  and TYR (melanin synthesis), GP100 (melanosome organization), RAB7/17/27 (melanosome
  transport), RAC1, and CDC42 (melanocytes dendrites) in B16F10 cells treated with
  DOI (30 μM), H89 (5 μM), and cotreatment. *** (p < 0.001) compared to control group;
  # (p < 0.05) compared to the group of B16F10 cells treated with DOI.'
