caption: Summary of the experimental design. Differentiated PC12 cells and mice were
  treated with Ukgansan or ropinirole before MPP+ and MPTP induced the toxicity. Pole
  test was performed on day 3 and 7 after the last injections of MPTP. Differentiated
  PC12 cells were analyzed 23â€‰h after stimulation of MPP+, and the brain tissues of
  mice were analyzed 7 days after the last injections of MPTP.
