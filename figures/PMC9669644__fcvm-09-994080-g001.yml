caption: Analysis of miR-199a-5p targets involved in Atherosclerosis. (A) Representation
  of miR-199a-5p expression in human tissue using Gtex Portal. Expression values are
  shown in TPM (Transcripts Per Million), calculated from a gene model with isoforms
  collapsed to a single gene. No other normalization steps have been applied. Box
  plots are shown as median and 25th and 75th percentiles and points are displayed
  as outliers if they are above or below 1.5 times the interquartile range. (B) Bioinformatic
  analysis of prominent miR-199a-5p target genes obtained thought TargetScan 6.2.
  involved in atherosclerosis using GeneMania. Blue lines indicate pathway co-localization,
  yellow lines indicate predicted and purple lines indicate co-expression. (C) Table
  of human predicted targets genes of miR-199a-5p involved in atherosclerosis obtained
  using TargetScan 6.2., showing the number and type of the putative binding sites
  and the conservation in mouse and human.
