caption: Crosstalk of major signaling pathways in melanoma metastasis. The interactions
  of several different signaling pathways, such as RAS/BRAF/MAPK pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, and β-catenin pathway are frequently involved in melanoma metastasis. Several
  of the components of the MAPK signaling pathway that is responsible for the transformation
  of melanocytes also play key roles in the melanoma metastasis. The illustrations
  were inspired by BioRender.
