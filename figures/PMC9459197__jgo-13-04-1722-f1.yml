caption: 'Luteolin inhibits the effects of M1 polarization on SW620 and SW480 cells.
  (A) RT-qPCR analysis of the impact of luteolin and M1 polarization on the expression
  of IL-6. (B) ELISA showed the impact of luteolin and M1 polarization on IL-6 protein
  secretion. (C) ELISA demonstrated the impact of luteolin and M1 polarization on
  IL-6 protein secretion in SW480 and SW620 cells. (D) CCK-8 assay assessed the impact
  of luteolin and M1 polarization on the proliferation rate of SW480 and SW620 cells.
  (E) Transwell assay showed the impact of luteolin and M1 polarization on the migration
  and invasion capabilities of SW480 and SW620 cells. Cells were stained with crystal
  violet. (F) Western blot analysis showing the impact of luteolin and M1 polarization
  on the phosphorylation level of STAT3. *, LPS group vs. Macrophages group, P<0.05;
  #, luteolin (10, 30, and 60 ÂµM) group vs. LPS group, P<0.05. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  IL-6, interleukin 6; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.'
