caption: Degradation pathway of PCN in strain DS-9. (A and B) HPLC analysis of metabolites
  that appeared during the degradation of PCN by strain DS-9. (C) MS analysis of compound
  I. The prominent protonated molecular ion of compound I was m/z 224.0817 [M+H]+,
  which was identified as phenazine-1-carboxamide (C13H9N3O+; m/z 224.0818), with
  a −0.7-ppm error. (D) MS analysis of compound II. The molecular ion mass of compound
  II was m/z 225.0656 [M+H]+, which corresponded to the protonated derivative of phenazine-1-carboxylic
  acid (C13H8N2O2+; m/z 225.0658), with a −0.9-ppm error. (E) MS analysis of compound
  III (m/z 211.0504 [M−H]−). The molecular ion mass of compound III was m/z 211.0504
  [M−H]−, which was in agreement with the deprotonated derivative of 1,2-dihydroxyphenazine
  (C12H8N2O2−; m/z 211.0513), with a −3.7-ppm error. A mass error between −5 ppm and
  5 ppm is acceptable for the identification of compounds (). (F) Proposed metabolic
  pathway of PCN in strain DS-9.
