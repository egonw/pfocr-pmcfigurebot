caption: The ROC analysis of each model in the internal validation and external validation
  cohorts. The X-axis and Y-axis represent specificity and sensitivity, respectively.
  The AUC values are indicated in the blue area, including KNN model (A,B), Naive
  Bayes model (C,D), SVM model (E,F), RF model (G,H), and ANN model (I,J). The value
  of the cut-off point is shown at the inflection point. ROC, receiver operating characteristic;
  AUC, area under the curve; KNN, k-nearest neighbor; SVM, support vector machine;
  RF, random forest; ANN, artificial neural network.
