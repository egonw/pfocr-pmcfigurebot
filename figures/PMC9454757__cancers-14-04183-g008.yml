caption: 'Knockdown of circRNA-0044301 inhibited ERK1/2 expression and enhanced the
  sensitivity of cells to 5-FU. (A) RIP-qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the interaction
  between circRNA-0044301 and ERK1/2 or p-ERK. (B) The trends of ERK1/2 and p-ERK
  protein expression were generally consistent with the trends of circRNA-0044301
  expression in four GC patients (only in patient #3 was the expression trend reversed,
  but it was consistent in the other three patients. ****: p < 0.0001; **: p < 0.01;
  *: p < 0.05). (C) IF results of ERK1/2 in cells after single GDC-0994 or combined
  transfection with si-circRNA-0044301 into cells; the ERK1/2 protein expression was
  inhibited after the addition of GDC-0994 compared with that in the control group,
  and when GDC-0994 was transfected with si-circRNA-0044301 into cells, ERK1/2 protein
  expression was further inhibited compared with that in the control group (The samples
  were imaged at 1000× magnification). (D) WB results of ERK1/2 with si-DAXX treated
  cells. (E) RIP-qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the interaction between ERK1/2 and
  DAXX. (F) CCK-8 assay for the cell viability of GC cells after 5-FU drug and combined
  treatment with si-circRNA-0044301 of HGC-27 cells (****: p < 0.0001). The whole
  western blots are shown in .'
