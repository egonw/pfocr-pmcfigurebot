caption: Analysis of the diameter and concentration for Citrus limon L.-derived nanovesicles
  using TEM and NTA. (A) Photograph of C. limon L. before obtaining juice (lemon in
  the back of the photo) and after obtaining juice by squeezing (lemon in front of
  the photo). (B) Representative photograph of nanovesicles obtained at 50,000Ã— magnification
  using transmission electron microscopy. Scale bar, 100 nm. (C) Size distribution
  of nanovesicles. Size distributions were determined by the nanoparticle tracking
  analysis.
