caption: Enteric P.e. infection induces expression of metabolic genes independently
  of the Imd pathway. qRT–PCR analysis of mRNA levels of a) AMPs, b) lipoprotein genes,
  c) TAG lipases, d) beta-oxidation genes, e) carbohydrate metabolism genes, and g),
  amino acid metabolism genes from control (w1118) vs imd mutant adult females, that
  were either mock-infected (grey bars and symbols) or infected by oral feeding with
  P.e. for 24 h (orange bars and symbols). Bars represent mean±SEM. Symbols represent
  individual data points, n = 4–6 per condition. *P < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA, followed
  by Student’s t-test.
