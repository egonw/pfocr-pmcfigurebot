caption: Shh signaling regulates RA-FLS migration via the Rho/ROCK pathway, revealed
  by wound healing assays. (a) In the Transwell assay, the numbers of migrated RA-FLS
  were higher in the treatment of purmorphamine; after RA-FLS treating with cyclopamine
  or purmorphamine combined with Y27632, the numbers of migrated cells were both decreased.
  (b) After 24 h, the wound healing duration of RA-FLS was increased as a result of
  purmorphamine treatment, while treated with cyclopamine or a combination of Purmorphamine
  and Y27632, it was decreased. (c) The wound healing area of RA-FLS in the treatment
  of purmorphamine was increased after 24 h, while it was decreased after treating
  with cyclopamine or a combination of purmorphamine for 24 h. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
