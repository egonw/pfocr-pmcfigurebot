caption: 'In vivo activation of the TI-IFN pathway in the kidney of mice or humans
  with kidney tubulointerstitial disease. (A,B) Kidney mRNA expression of ISGs (Ifit1,
  Usp18, Oasl2) and Ifnb measured by qRT-PCR in murine tubulointerstitial kidney injury
  induced by folic acid (FAN) (A) or LPS (B). Bar charts represent the Mean ± SEM
  in control and kidney injured mice. *p ≤ 0.05 vs vehicle-injected control mice.
  (C) Mice with FAN (left) or LPSN (right) show higher renal IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 mRNA
  levels than controls (Cont), detected by qRT-PCR at different timepoints (LPSN:
  1–24 h; FAN: 24–96 h). *p ≤ 0.05 vs control untreated animals (n = 3-7/temporal
  group). (D) Kidney IFNAR2 was overexpressed in LPS and FAN mice. Representative
  optical microscopy pictures show an increased tubular location of IFNAR2 detected
  by immunohistochemistry, especially in sections of intense tubular damage (boxed
  areas which are shown at higher magnification below). Yellow arrows point to damaged/dilated
  tubules expressing IFNAR2. The bar chart shows the signal quantification in the
  entire set of control and LPS-treated (LPSN, 24 h; n = 5) or folic acid-treated
  (FAN, 48 h; n = 4) animals. Results are expressed as the Mean ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs
  control animals without kidney injury. Original magnification ×200. Scale bar 100 µm.
  (E) Increased kidney IFNβ expression during LPSN and FAN. Representative optical
  microscopy pictures of immunohistochemical detection of IFNβ in LPS (n = 3) and
  FAN (n = 3) kidneys. Boxed sections and the corresponding magnified images below
  highlight areas of intense staining surrounding tubules (yellow arrows), the Bowman’s
  capsule (red arrow), and inside glomeruli (black arrow), suggestive of endothelial
  location. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control untreated group. Original magnification ×200. Increased
  IFNβ was also detected by confocal microscopy (white arrows). Scale bar 100 µm.
  (F) Confocal microscopy images of representative LPSN and FAN kidneys stained for
  IFNβ (green) and CD31 (red) (upper panel) and for IFNβ (red) and F4/80 (green) (middle
  panel). Endothelial cells expressing CD31, but not mononuclear phagocytes (F4/80),
  display a marked IFNβ signal. Colocalization was assessed by Mander’s overlap coefficient
  (MOC) (ImageJ Fiji, JACOP plugging). Bar chart represents the Mean ± SEM, n = 3
  mice/group) (lower panel). White arrows indicate cells tracked through the IFNβ/CD31
  or IFNβ/F4/80 fluorescence channels. Original magnification ×200. Scale bar 10 µm.
  (G) Increased IFNAR2 expression in acute human tubulointerstitial nephropathy (AHN).
  Representative optical microscopy pictures from renal biopsies (AHN1 and AHN2) show
  damaged tubules with strong tubular IFNAR2 staining. Boxed areas are enlarged below.
  In situ (yellow arrows) or detached (white arrows) tubular cells show high IFNAR
  content. The graph shows the Mean ± SEM of IFNAR2 signal in the entire set of patients.
  *p ≤ 0.05 vs control group, n = 5. Original magnification ×200. Scale bar 100 µm.'
