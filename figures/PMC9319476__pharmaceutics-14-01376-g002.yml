caption: Mechanisms regulating P-gp expression in the blood–brain barrier in Alzheimer’s
  disease. In AD-affected brain regions, P-gp expression and abundance in the endothelial
  cells of the blood-brain–barrier is significantly reduced. Various mechanisms have
  been investigated linking the increased amount of amyloid (A)-peptides Aβ40 and
  Aβ42 to a reduction in P-gp involving NF-κB, and NEDD4-1 mediated ubiquitination
  and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
