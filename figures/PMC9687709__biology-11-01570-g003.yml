caption: Metabolic pathways in animal and human models potentially involved in the
  aging processes. Graphs were generated by the metabolite set enrichment analysis
  (MSEA) using the MetaboAnalyst program (www.metaboanalyst.ca; accessed on 18 September
  2022) (“pathway analysis” option) by projecting metabolites onto metabolic pathways.
  The lists of metabolites associated with aging, which are presented in the papers
  mentioned in this review, were used for projection. Names of metabolic pathways
  with statistically significant (p < 0.01) enrichment with projected metabolites
  are shown. The p value evaluates whether a measured set of metabolites is represented
  in the pathway more than expected by chance within a given list of metabolites (p
  values from the pathway enrichment analysis). Metabolic pathways of Homo sapiens
  (for the “Humans” and “Dogs” graphs), Mus musculus (for the “Mice” graph), Danio
  rerio (zebrafish) (for the “Fishes” graph), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)
  (for the “Drosophila” graph), Caenorhabditis elegans (for the “C. elegans” graph)
  from the KEGG were used to project metabolites. Pathway impact values are from the
  pathway topology analysis.
