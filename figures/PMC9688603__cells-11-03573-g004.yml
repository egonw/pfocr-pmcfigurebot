caption: The mechanism of melatonin in reducing oxidative damages in vitrified oocytes.
  Melatonin can enter oocytes through receptors, act on the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling
  pathway, and enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes, protect normal morphology
  and function of organelles such as mitochondria and the spindle, and ensure the
  correct segregation of meiotic chromosomes. Melatonin can also directly penetrate
  into cells to scavenge free radicals, reduce intracellular ROS, and improve the
  development potential of cells in vitro. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on
