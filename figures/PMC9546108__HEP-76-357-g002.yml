caption: Ectopic livers restored hepatic functions in Fah−/− mice. (A) Relative gene
  expression (transcripts per million) of genes in the tyrosine catabolism pathway
  in ectopic liver (red bar, n = 3), native tyrosinemic liver (green bar, n = 5),
  and control LN (purple bar, n = 5) compared to control native liver (blue bar, n = 4).
  (B) Relative expression of genes in coagulation system, urea cycle, albumin synthesis,
  and bilirubin transport and conjugation in the four conditions as in (A). (C) Relative
  expression of genes in bile acid synthesis and transport, as well as related key
  transcription factors in the four conditions as in (A). The full names of genes
  are listed in Table . BA, bile acid; TPM, transcripts per million
article_title: Fat‐associated lymphoid clusters as expandable niches for ectopic liver
  development.
