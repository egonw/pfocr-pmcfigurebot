caption: 'MYCL activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway. (A) Analysis of the Gene Expression
  Omnibus GSE45498 dataset showed that MYCL was highly expressed in TNBC. (B) Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis of GSE45498 showed that MYCL activated the JAK/STAT3 pathway.
  In MDA-MB-453 cells transfected with MYCL siRNAs, the expression levels of (C) JAK/STAT3
  pathway-related proteins and (E) STAT3 downstream proteins were assessed by western
  blotting. In MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pc-MYCL, the expression of (D) JAK/STAT3
  pathway-related proteins and (F) STAT3 downstream proteins were assessed by western
  blotting. *P<0.05 vs. si-NC; #P<0.05 vs. pc-NC. NC, negative control; si/siRNA,
  small interfering RNA; p, phosphorylated; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; MYCL,
  MYCL proto-oncogene.'
