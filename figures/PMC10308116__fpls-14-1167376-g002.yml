caption: ABA-mediated signaling pathway during normal and drought stress conditions.
  Under normal conditions, ABA content is low, and SnRK2 protein kinase activity is
  inhibited by PP2C phosphatases. Under drought stress, the cellular ABA level increases,
  and ABA then binds to PYR/PYL/RCARs, which in turn bind and inactivate PP2Cs. The
  SnRK2s autoactivate when they dissociate from PP2Cs. Activated SnRK2s phosphorylate
  downstream targets and trigger ABA-induced physiological and molecular responses.
