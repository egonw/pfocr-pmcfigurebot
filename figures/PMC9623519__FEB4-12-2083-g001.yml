caption: RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that MYPT1 is involved
  in a MAPK‐related pathway in ccRCC. (A) The volcano plot shows genes differentially
  expressed between Caki1 cells with MYPT1 overexpression group and the negative control
  group (P < 0.05). (B) KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed genes (¦log2FC¦ > 1,
  FDR‐adjusted P < 0.05) was performed in Caki1‐NC and Caki1‐MYPT1 cells. (C) GSEA
  revealed that the MAPK signalling pathway gene set was less enriched in Caki1‐MYPT1
  cells (FDR < 25% and P < 0.05). (D) KEGG analysis of the MYPT1‐correlated genes
  (P < 0.05) in the TCGA‐KIRC dataset. (E) The 17 overlapping genes were enriched
  in the MAPK pathway based on the differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing
  data or MYPT1‐correlated genes from TCGA‐KIRC dataset. ccRCC, renal clear cell carcinoma;
