caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for EIF4EBP1 in breast cancer, and demonstration
  of increased Ki67 and mTOR signaling in high expressing EIF4EBP1-tumors. (A) GSEA
  results from the Hallmark gene sets significant in all three cohorts (TCGA, METABRIC,
  and SCAN-B). A false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.25 was considered statistically
  significant. Dot size represents the FDR value, and they are colored according to
  the normalized enrichment score (NES). MTORC1 signaling gene set labelled in blue,
  and cell cycling-related gene sets labelled in red. (B) Most enriched gene sets
  in single cell RNA sequencing cohorts from cohorts described in [] (left), and in
  [] (right). MTORC1 signaling gene set labelled in blue, and cell cycling-related
  gene sets labelled in red. (C) Ki67 box plots based on median EIF4EBP1 expression.
  (D) MTOR gene set defined by genes upregulated following siroliumus treatment as
  described in [] (Left). MTOR gene set defined by genes upregulated following everolimus
  treatment as described in [] (Middle). MTOR gene set defined by genes downregulated
  following siroliumus treatment as described in [] (Right). For results in (C) and
  (D), EIF4EBP1 expression is dichotomized into low and high groups by the median.
  The bolded center bar within the boxplots represents the median, the lower and upper
  box bounds represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the lower
  and upper tails represent the minimum and maximum values, respectively.

  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
