figure_title: Exposure to mint-flavored JUUL aerosol in utero significantly alters
  expression of Wnt signaling and epigenetic chromatin modification genes in lungs
  of PND0 offspring
caption: A) Epigenetic Chromatin Modification and Wnt Signaling Pathway-related gene
  dysregulation in lungs of neonates exposed to JUUL, examined at PND0. N = 4 per
  group. Data expressed as fold-change compared to air control. Genes with at least
  a 1.5-fold up- or down-regulation were considered to have significant differences
  of expression compared with controls. B) The gene interaction networks altered by
  in utero JUUL exposure are correlated with a number of vital processes in fetal
  and neonatal development via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of dysregulated genes
  neonates exposed to JUUL in utero. Neonates exposed to JUUL in utero exhibited dysregulation
  of genes associated with Wnt signaling, regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  pathway, PCP pathway, methylation of DNA, methylation of DNA endogenous promoter,
  morphogenesis of embryo, differentiation of embryonic cells, quantity of connective
  tissue, growth of epithelial tissue, apoptosis, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling.
