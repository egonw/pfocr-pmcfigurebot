caption: Clinical application of tsRNAs as a cancer diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic
  target for tumors. (A-B) tsRNAs can be used as a novel biomarker for cancer diagnosis.
  tsRNAs are found in human tissues and various body fluids (e.g. plasma, serum, urine,
  cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva) (A); Dysregulation of tsRNAs is closely related
  to clinicopathological features (such as tumor progression and poor prognosis) (B).
  (C-E) tsRNAs also have potential as cancer therapeutic targets. In mouse xenotransplantation
  models, overexpression of tRF3008A inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of
  CRC cells by inhibiting the FOXK1/Wnt pathway (C); anti-leu3’tslna (knockdown 3’tRF-LeuCAG)
  reduces ribosomal biogenesis by down-regulating RPS28 mRNA translation, thereby
  inhibiting HCC cell proliferation (D); tRF-Glu-TTC-027 agomir (overexpressing tRF-Glu-TTC-027)
  inhibits GC cell proliferation by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway (E)
