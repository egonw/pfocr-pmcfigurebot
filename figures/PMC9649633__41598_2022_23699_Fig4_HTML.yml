caption: KDM1A knockdown repressed c-Myc expression. (A, B) The GSEA pathway analysis
  revealed that KDM1A co-expressed genes might regulate the Myc signaling. (C, D)
  The c-Myc protein and mRNA levels were explored in H1299 and A549 stable cell lines
  with KDM1A knockdown. According to the molecular weight, the nitrocellulose membrane
  was cut prior to hybridization with antibodies and the original blots are presented
  in Supplementary Fig. . (E, F) The combination treatment of KDM1A knockdown and
  c-Myc knockdown synergistically inhibited c-Myc expression in H1299 and A549 cells.
  According to the molecular weight, the nitrocellulose membrane was cut prior to
  hybridization with antibodies and the original blots are presented in Supplementary
  Fig. .
