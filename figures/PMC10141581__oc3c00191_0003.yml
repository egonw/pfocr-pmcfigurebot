caption: Evaluation of the Frb-v1 pathway efficiency and fidelity. (A) Comparison
  of single (1×, 150TAG) and double site (2×, 134/150TAG) nhpSer incorporation in
  sfGFP when nhpSer is biosynthesized via the Frb-v1 pathway and when supplemented
  in the media at 2 mM concentration. The wild-type expression level and the efficiency
  of pSer GCE systems are shown for comparison. Error bars represent standard deviations
  of expressions performed in triplicate. (B) SDS-PAGE and Phos-tag gels of the purified
  proteins expressed in panel A. Phos-tag gels contain an acrylamide derivative that
  transiently interacts with phospho-groups, causing phospho-proteins to migrate slower
  than unmodified proteins. NhpSer-containing proteins migrate slower than their equivalent
  pSer-containing proteins, providing a convenient method to distinguish between the
  two isosteres., For each lane 2 μg of protein was loaded, so band intensities are
  not reflective of expression yield. (C) Whole-protein mass spectrometry of single
  and double site pSer and nhpSer incorporation into sfGFP (when nhpSer is biosynthesized
  by the Frb-v1 pathway). (D) Zoom in of the peaks in panel C for 1× and 2× pSer/nhpSer
  incorporated sfGFP confirm the expected mass differences of a bridging O to CH2
  substitution. (E) Measured and expected whole-protein masses shown in panels C and
  D.
