caption: CCDC-PA inhibited the cell invasion of HSC-3 and SCC4 cells treated with
  CCDC-PA at various stoichiometric ratios for 24 h. Transwell Matrigel invasion assay
  of (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC4 cells. Representative photographs and quantitative data
  are shown. Control indicates a condition without treatment of CCDC-PA. 1:20, 1:10,
  1:5 1:2, and 1:1 indicate the final concentration of PA in the CCDC system is equivalent
  to 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL respectively. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D.,
  with *P< 0.05 and **P< 0.01 indicating the significant difference from the controls.
