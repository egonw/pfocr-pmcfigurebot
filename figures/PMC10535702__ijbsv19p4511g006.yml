caption: Expression status of RB1 pathway targets in HCC cells and in clinical samples;
  CDK2-IN-73 and Palbociclib can relieve apatinib resistance. A. qPCR analysis showed
  that the expression levels of RB1, PCNA, KIAA0101 and MCM7 in HepG2-resistant cells
  were significantly reduced, and the expression levels of CDKN2B andCDKN2AIP were
  increased. B. Western blot detection of the above proteins is consistent with qPCR
  detection results. C. Analysis of mRNA expression of five PD patients showed high
  expression of CDKN2B and low expression of RB1, PCNA, and MCM7. D. Western blot
  analysis showed that PD patients had high expression of CDKN2B but low expression
  of RB1, PCNA, and MCM7. E. Representative photographs of staining of RB1 protein
  in a pair of HCC patients tissues in PD and PR (20X). F. Representative photographs
  of staining of CDKN2B protein in a pair of HCC patients tissues in PD and PR (20X).
  G. The proliferation inhibition curves of resistant HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells
  treated with CDK2-IN-73. H. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of
  CDKN2B in HepG2resistant cells was not significantly different, and the expression
  levels of RB1, PCNA and MCM7 were upregulated. I. Proliferation inhibition curves
  of HepG2 resistant cells and HepG2 cells treated with Palbociclib. J. Western blot
  analysis results showed that the expression levels of RB1, PCNA, and MCM7 were upregulated.
