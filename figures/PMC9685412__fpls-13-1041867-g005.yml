caption: Visualization of 35S-2×GFP//35S-RFP:NLS expression and 2×GFP intercellular
  movement in epidermal cells of N. benthamiana leaves. (A) Schematic representation
  of 35S-2×GFP//35S-RFP:NLS construct containing two expression cassettes. Single
  cell (B) and multicellular cluster (C) in leaves agroinfiltrated with 2×GFP//35S-RFP:NLS
  supplemented with “empty vector” pBIN (B) or with 35S-KPILP (C). The primary infected
  cell nucleus is indicated by the fluorescent signal from RFP and this cell outline
  is marked with a dashed line. Scale bar, 50 µm.
