caption: 'KRAS‐G12D mutation suppressed PD‐L1 protein level via the P70S6K/PI3K/AKT
  axis. (A) Western blotting analysis of PD‐L1 and kinase signaling pathways in Beas‐2B
  cells with KRAS mutation. (B) Western blotting analysis of protein levels of PD‐L1,
  CXCL10, CXCL11, and HMGA2 and kinase signaling pathway in cell lines with KRAS mutation
  after treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (0.5 μmol/L) for 24 h. Abbreviations:
  G12A, Beas‐2B cells stably transfected with vector coding for mutant KRAS‐Gly12Ala
  (G12A); G12C, Beas‐2B cells stably transfected with vector coding for mutant KRAS‐Gly12Cys
  (G12C); G12D, Beas‐2B cells stably transfected with vector coding for mutant KRAS‐Gly12Asp
  (G12D); G12V, Beas‐2B cells stably transfected with vector coding for mutant KRAS‐Gly12Val
  (G12V).'
