figure_title: Knockdown of c-Met expression suppresses PNI in vivo
caption: A Limb function of nude mice in the normal saline, NC, and sh Met groups.
  B Sciatic nerve score of nude mice in the NC and sh Met groups. C Anatomy results
  of the growth and migration of cancer cells along the sciatic nerve. D, E Distance
  of cancer cells migrating along the sciatic nerve. F, G Cancer cells invade and
  migrate along the sciatic nerve to the spinal cord. The neural structure is destroyed
  during cell invasion (red arrow). Nervous tissue continuity in the invasion front
  is better (black arrow). H Macroscopic images of the subcutaneous tumor model result
  from the NC and sh Met groups. I Weights of the tumors in the NC and sh Met groups.
  J Volumes of the tumors in the NC and sh Met groups. K The expression of c-Met,
  p-mTOR, N-cadherin, and NGF was detected by IHC in the NC and sh Met group. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
article_title: HGF/c-Met pathway facilitates the perineural invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by activating the mTOR/NGF axis.
