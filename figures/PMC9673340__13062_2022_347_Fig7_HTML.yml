caption: miR-139-5p sponging activity decreases CTBP1 levels, affecting the biological
  behavior of pancreatic cancer. A, B Transwell and Sphere formation assays were performed
  in BxPC-3 cells after co-transfection with miRNA-139-5p mimics and/or CTBP1 overexpression
  plasmid. C Stem cell-like cell markers Lin28, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2 were detected
  by western blot following the indicated transfections in BxPC-3 cells. D–E Transwell
  and Sphere formation assays were performed in MIA Paca-2 cells following the indicated
  transfections. F Stem cell-like cell markers Lin28, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2 were
  detected by western blot following the indicated transfections in MIA Paca-2 cells.
  G, H Transwell and Sphere formation assays were performed in PANC-1 cells after
  co-transfection with miRNA-139-5p-shRNA and CTBP1-shRNA. I Stem cell-like cell markers
  Lin28, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2 were detected by western blot following the indicated
  transfections in PANC-1 cells. J–L Pancreatic cancer cells with indicated transfections
  were treated with GEM at different concentrations for 48 h. Cell viability was measured
  by MTT assay. M–O Pancreatic cancer cells with indicated transfections were treated
  with GEM (1 μM) for 48 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay at different
  timepoints. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
