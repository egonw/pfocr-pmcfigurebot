caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 inhibited tumour growth and metastasis in mice.
  Mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n = 6 per group). A lentiviral vector was
  constructed and mice in each group were injected with 5 × 106 SW480, SW480‐shMIF,
  SW480‐shSLC3A2, SW480‐shMIF + shSLC3A2 or SW480‐shCon cells, respectively. (A) Measurements
  of tumour size in each group of mice. (B) Measurements of tumour volume in each
  group of mice. (C) Measurements of tumour weight in each group of mice. (D) MIF,
  SLC3A2 and GPX4 mRNA expression in the tumour tissues of mice in each group. (E)
  Western blotting was performed to confirm MIF, SLC3A2, GPX4, AKT, pAKT, pGSK‐3β
  and GSK‐3β protein expression in the tumour tissues of mice in each group. (F) MIF,
  SLC3A2 and GPX4 protein expression in the tumour tissues of mice in each group.
  (G) pAKT/AKT and pGSK‐3β/GSK‐3β protein expression in the tumour tissues of mice
  in each group. (H) The ratio of GSH/GSSG in the tumour tissues of mice in each group.
  ‘*’ means p < 0.05 when compared with the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05 when
  compared with the shCon group. GAPDH served as an invariant internal control for
  calculating fold changes in protein expression
