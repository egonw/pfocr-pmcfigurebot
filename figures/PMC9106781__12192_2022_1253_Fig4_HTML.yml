caption: Schematic representation of the interaction between Keap1 protein and HSP90
  protein. In homeostatic condition, Keap1 is able to interact with HSP90 protein
  and promotes the antioxidant response when an oxidant stimulus occurs. Alterations
  in Keap1 functionality, as an example in A549 cell line or when Keap1 is knockdown
  with siKeap1 RNA transfection, negatively affect the COX2 activity.
