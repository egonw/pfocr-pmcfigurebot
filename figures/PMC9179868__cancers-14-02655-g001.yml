caption: Crosstalk of epigenetic changes with glycolysis and lipid metabolism in GB.
  CpG promoter hypomethylation increases CAV-1 expression, stimulating GLUT3 transcription.
  Moreover, HK2 promoter hypomethylation and PKM hypomethylation promote aerobic glycolysis.
  Additional glycolytic gene promoters in mesenchymal subtype GBs, including ENO1,
  GLAM, HK3, GAPDH, and LDHA, are further upregulated by hypomethylation. Elevated
  histone mark H3K27me3 expression on the EAF2 promoter favor its transcription and
  a shift towards glycolysis. Histone deacetylation has been involved in the elevation
  of c-myc expression, which interacts with miR-let-7a, PKM2, and hnRNPA1 to ensure
  PKM2 upregulation. MiR-let-7a and miR-34c inhibit PKM2 and c-myc signaling. TP53TG1
  lncRNA increases GRP78 and IDH1 expression. MiRNAs can downregulate GLUT3 and inhibit
  glycolysis at various levels (HK1/2/3 and PKM2) as well as the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Diffuse midline gliomas with H3K27M mutation, exhibit upregulation of glycolysis
  and the TCA cycle. In addition, OXPHOS is increased, and lipid metabolism is shifted
  towards cholesterol synthesis. This is achieved by a network of molecules including
  EGFR, which upregulates miR-29 that then increases SREBP-1 and SCAP.
