caption: 'NF-κB signalling in human skeletal muscle in response to incremental exercise
  to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia, and post-exercise ischaemia. Levels
  of protein expression of (A) NF-κB p105, (B) NF-κB p50, (C) Total NF-κB p65, (D)
  NF-κB p65 + p50 dimer and (E) pSer536 NF-κB. Nx: normoxia session (FIO2 = 0.21,
  PIO2 = 143 mmHg); Hyp: severe normobaric hypoxia session (FIO2 = 0.104, PIO2 = 73 mmHg);
  Pre: before exercise; Post: 10 s after exercise cessation during ischaemic recovery;
  Oc1m: 60 s after exercise cessation during ischaemic recovery; FC1m: 60 s after
  exercise cessation during recovery with free circulation. For panels (A), (B), (D)
  n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9), Post Hyp (n = 10) and FC1m
  (n = 10), for panel (C) n = 11 for all conditions except for Oc1m Nx (n = 9) and
  for panel (E) n = 11 for all conditions except for Post Nx (n = 10), Oc1m Nx (n = 9),
  Post Hyp (n = 10) and FC1m (n = 10), See  for a detailed description of the experimental
  phases. The statistical analysis was performed with logarithmically transformed
  data for NF-κB p105, Total NF-Κb p65 and NF-κB p65 + p50 dimer. Values presented
  are means ± standard errors and expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.). †p < 0.05 vs.
  Pre Nx; *p < 0.05 vs. Pre Hyp; #p < 0.05 vs. Post Hyp; §p < 0.05 vs. Oc1m Hyp.'
