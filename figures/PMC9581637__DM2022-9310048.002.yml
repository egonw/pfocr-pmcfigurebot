caption: DLEU2 sponge adsorbs miR-30a-5p. (a) Hierarchical clustering heat map shows
  differentially expressed miRNA between the oral cancer and control groups. (b) The
  miRNA chip and the starBase database were combined to analyze the potential miRNAs
  that bind to DLEU2. (c) Relative expression of miR-30a-5p in RWPE-2 and four oral
  cancer cell lines (C4-2, 22RV1, Tca8113, and CAL-27). (d) RT-qPCR analysis of the
  effect of si-DLEU2 on the expression of miR-30a-5p in Tca8113 and CAL-27 cells.
  (e) The starBase database predicts the binding sites of DLEU2 and miR-30a-5p. (f)
  Dual-luciferase assay analysis of the binding of DLEU2 to miR-30a-5p. âˆ—P < 0.05.
