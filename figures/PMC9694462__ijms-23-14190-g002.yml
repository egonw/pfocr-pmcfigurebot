caption: 5D3PC promoted melanogenesis in human melanocytes; PIG1 and PIG3V. (A,B)
  Morphological changes in 5D3PC treated PIG3V cells at 200× magnification. (C) Different
  concentrations (0–50 μM) of 5D3PC on PIG3V and PIG1 cell viability were measured
  by CCK-8 assay. (D) Effect of 5D3PC on Melanin content of PIG3V and PIG1 melanocytes
  treated with different concentrations (1, 10, and 50 µM) of 5D3PC for 48 h. DMSO
  (0.1%) was used as the vehicle control, and 8-MOP (100 µM) as the positive control.
  (E) The expression of melanogenic genes in PIG3V cells treated with different concentrations
  (0–50 µM) of 5D3PC. All results are expressed as mean ± SD; statistical analysis
  was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001 compared with NC (negative control)
  group.
