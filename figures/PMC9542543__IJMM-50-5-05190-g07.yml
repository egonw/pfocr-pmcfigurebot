caption: CAPE alleviates OA progression in a DMM rat model. (A) Degeneration of articular
  cartilage was observed using the Safranin O/Fast Green staining. Upper panel scale
  bar, 200 µm; lower panel scale bar, 100 µm. The images on the bottom panel are a
  larger image of the boxed areas in the respective top panels. (B) Immunohistochemistry
  of MMP3, MMP13, collagen II and NRF2 was employed to assess the effect of CAPE on
  cartilage in the DMM models. Scale bar, 100 µm. (C) Schematic illustration of the
  potential protective effects and the underlying mechanism of CAPE in OA development.
  *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; OA, osteoarthritis;
  DMM, destabilization of the medial meniscus; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2.
