caption: RASSF4 regulates 5‐FU sensitivity in CRC cells. (A) CCK‐8 assays showed that
  ectopic RASSF4 expression decreased cell viability in LoVo cells treated with 4 μg/ml
  5‐FU, while RASSF4 depletion increased cell viability in HCT‐8 cells treated with
  2 μg/ml 5‐FU. (B) Annexin V/PI analysis demonstrated that RASSF4 overexpression
  significantly increased apoptosis rate in LoVo cells treated with 5‐FU, while RASSF4 siRNA
  depletion downregulated apoptosis rate in HCT‐8 cells treated with 5‐FU. (C) JC‐1 staining
  showed that ectopic RASSF4 expression in LoVo cells upregulated green percentage,
  indicating a downregulating effect of RASSF4 on Δψm. RASSF4 siRNA treatment showed
  the opposite effect in HCT‐8 cells. *p < 0.05

  colorectal cancer through YAP/Bcl‐2 pathway.
