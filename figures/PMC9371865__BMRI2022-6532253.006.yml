caption: Ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells regulated by LTBP2 can be blocked by
  NK-252. (a–c, e) The intracellular productions of ROS, MDA, and MSSG were decreased
  after coculture with NK-252. (d, f) The productions of GSH and GPX4 were increased
  correspondingly after treated with NK-252. Quantitative data are presented as mean s
  ± SD from three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.01 vs. the control.
