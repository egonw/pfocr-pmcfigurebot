caption: Effect of caffeine on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatic tissue from
  the NASH model. (A) IF analysis of NLRP3/caspase 1 in hepatic tissues from rats
  in the control, HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine, and caffeine groups. White arrow
  = Colocalization between NLRP3 inflammasome and pro-caspase-1 marks. (B) IF intensity
  quantification of NLRP3 and caspase-1 (n = 3). (C) Levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and
  ASC proteins detected using western blot (n = 3); β-actin was used as a loading
  control. Values are shown as a fold increment in optical density normalized to control
  group values (control = 1). Bars represent the mean ± SEM. (a) p < 0.05 compared
  with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4 group. The slides
  were observed under a confocal microscope at 63× magnification.
