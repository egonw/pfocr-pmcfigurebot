caption: 'Modes of action of the GmPUB21 U-box E3 ligase was divided into two different
  pathways: ABA-dependent and other signals. GmPUB21 as a positive effect on the ABA
  signaling pathway promote the stomatal closure. The other signal by which GmPUB21
  regulates drought and salinity responses is not known. Overexpressing GmPUB21 leads
  to increasing the stomatal density, and also regulated the stomatal aperture in
  response to drought and salinity stress. In addition, GmPUB21 as a U-box E3 ligase
  may involved in the ubiquitination pathway to regulate the development of stomata
  and the response to drought and salt stress.'
