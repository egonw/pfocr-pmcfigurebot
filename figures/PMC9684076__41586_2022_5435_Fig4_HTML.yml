figure_title: F. nucleatum induces neutrophil swarming and the migration of cancer
  epithelial cells
caption: a, Live-cell confocal imaging showing neutrophil movements relating to CRC
  spheroids without (left) or with (right) F. nucleatum. Colour bars represent neutrophil
  cluster volume (µm3). Scale bars, 100 μm. b,c, Average speed (b) and cell displacement
  (c) of neutrophils migrating inside untreated control (lilac) and F. nucleatum-treated
  (red) spheroids. Red bars indicate mean. Data points represent individual tracks;
  n indicates the number of tracks per condition; three independent experiments. P
  values calculated by Mann–Whitney test. d, Neutrophil cell trajectory plots. e,
  Left, the log10-transformed fold change in volume over time of neutrophil clusters
  relative to the initial volume (T = 0 h). Data points represent average volume per
  time point, per condition. Right, quantification of the area under the curve for
  the fold change in volume. f, Confocal microscopy of HCT116 spheroid invasion capabilities
  without (left) or with (right) F. nucleatum over 19 h. Inset images represent differences
  in migration modes. Scale bar, 100 μm. g, The log10-transformed fold change in volume
  over time, representing the expansion rate of uninfected CRC spheroids. Error bars,
  s.d. h, Number of F. nucleatum-positive single cancer cells detaching from the spheroid
  over time. Error bars, s.d. i,j, Average speed (i) and cell displacement (j) of
  single cells escaping the F. nucleatum-infected spheroid. Red bars indicate mean.
  Data points represent individual tracks; n indicates the number of tracks per condition;
  three independent experiments. k, Cell trajectories of invading cancer cells escaping
  the F. nucleatum-infected spheroids. l, Signalling pathway analysis of CRC spheroids
  infected with F. nucleatum compared to uninfected control. The directed global significance
  (DGS) score was calculated as the square root of the mean squared t-statistic for
  genes in a gene set. ECM, extracellular matrix. m, Volcano plots of differential
  gene expression for selected pathways in F. nucleatum-infected spheroids compared
  to uninfected controls. Dashed lines indicate the threshold of significance, defined
  as log2-transformed fold change ≤ −0.58 and ≥ 0.58 and −log10(P) ≥ 1.301 after LMM
  analysis and Benjamini–Hochberg multiple-correction testing.
