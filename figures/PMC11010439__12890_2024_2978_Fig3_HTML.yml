caption: 'The core gene SPP1 is involved in the pathway screening of smoking-related
  COPD occurrence. Note: (A) Protein interaction network diagram of 64 candidate mRNAs,
  with darker colors indicating more associated molecules, with SPP1 being the darkest
  color; (B) Bubble plot of KEGG functional enrichment analysis results for SPP1-related
  genes, with redder colors indicating larger p-values and larger bubbles indicating
  more molecules included in the pathway. The x-axis represents the ratio of molecules;
  (C) The position and relationship of IL-17 A in the IL-17 signaling pathway; (D)
  the KEGG database was used to screen for genes related to SPP1 in the IL-17 signaling
  pathway (hsa04657); (E) Boxplot of the expression levels of SPP1, S100A9, MMP9,
  TNFAIP3, IL6, IL1B, MMP1, S100A8, and CCL20, where blue represents the normal control
  group, and red represents the smoking COPD group; (F) Correlation analysis plot
  of 8 genes related to SPP1 in the IL-17 signaling pathway'
