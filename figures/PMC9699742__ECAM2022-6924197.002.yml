caption: 'The effect of GJD on morphologic changes and collagen of left ventricular
  tissue by H & E and Masson staining and collagen volume fraction in each group:
  (a) H & E staining in each group, (b) Masson staining in each group (fibrotic tissues
  labeled blue, and ventricular cells marked red), and (c) collagen volume fraction
  (200x magnification images) (n = 7). Control: WKY (Wistar–Kyoto rats), model: spontaneously
  hypertensive rats (SHRs), GJD-L: SHR received GJD low dose, GJD-M: SHR received
  GJD medium dose, GJD-H: SHR received GJD high dose, and CAPT: SHR received captopril.
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and
  ###P < 0.001 vs. model.'
