caption: Ischemia and anesthesia-related signaling pathways associated with DEGs at
  24 h after tMCAO. DAVID v. 2021 was used to enrich DEGs via KEGG PATHWAY (KP) annotations
  (pathways). (a) A Venn diagram presenting the results of a comparison between IR-lt
  vs. SO-lt and IR-st vs. SO-st KP annotations. The number of annotations is indicated
  in the diagram segments. (b,c) Top five significant pathways that lay within the
  intersection on the Venn diagram (a). Each pathway was included based on the Padj
  values, as well as the number of corresponding up- and downregulated DEGs in IR-lt
  vs. SO-lt (b) and IR-st vs. SO-st (c). (d,e) Top five significant pathways that
  lay outside of the intersection on the Venn diagrams (a). Each pathway was included
  based on the Padj values, as well as the number of corresponding up- and downregulated
  DEGs in IR-lt vs. SO-lt and (d) in IR-st vs. SO-st (e). Only DEGs and KP annotations
  with Padj < 0.05 were considered to be significant; n = 3 per group.
