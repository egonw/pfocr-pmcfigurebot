caption: 'Enveloped (HCV, HBV) and non-enveloped hepatitis (HAV, HEV) viruses infect
  primarily hepatocytes. The non-enveloped viruses may potentially use the exosomal
  biogenesis pathway for egress, producing quasi-enveloped virions (bottom-right circle).
  All hepatitis viruses can exploit exosomes to egress and transfer their genetic
  material, together with viral proteins involved in replication, into permissive
  cells, as the exosomes grant them invisibility from host neutralising antibodies
  (top-right circle). However, if the host mounts efficient immune responses, as in
  the case of HAV and HEV, the viruses are cleared at the acute phase of infection
  (dashed red arrow). For viruses that achieve persistence, such as HCV and HBV, exosomes
  may be used for independent or consecutive (red arrow on the left) deregulation
  of the innate (top circle) and adaptive immune responses (bottom-left circle), leading
  to sustained immune evasion, immunotolerance, and immunosuppression. The exosomal
  cargo consists of immunoregulatory proteins, lipids, enzymes, and small RNAs (truncated
  cone) and may exert its immunoregulatory capacity on all immune cells, down-regulating
  antiviral responses whilst up-regulating tolerance. Eventually, constant immune
  response dysfunction, together with misdirected signalling and deregulated cellular
  homeostasis, lead to initiation of liver fibrosis and promote malignant transformation
  and HCC development (top-left circle). Key: Mono: monocytes; MÏ†: macrophages; CD4+/CD8+
