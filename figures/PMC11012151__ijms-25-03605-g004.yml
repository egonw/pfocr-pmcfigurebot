caption: Role of exercise-mediated increase in Sirt1 in amelioration of DN. Exercise
  training impedes the downregulation of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase
  (CSE) and restores renal H2S production in DN mice, which enhances renal Sirt1 expression
  and is accompanied by inhibition of the p53-mediated pro-apoptotic pathway. At the
  same time, Sirt1 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation and activation
  of PGC1-α. Sirt1 can also exert anti-inflammatory effects by deacetylating the p65
  subunit, thereby inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The upward
  red arrow means up-regulation of expression. Created with BioRender.com, accessed
