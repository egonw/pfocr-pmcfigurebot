caption: 'Myricetin induces apoptosis via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  in the AGSgastric cancer cell.(A) The AGSgastric cancer cells were treated with
  myricetin (0, 15, and 25 μM) for 24 h, and the cellular lysates were subjected to
  western blotting with p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR. (B) The AGSgastric cancer cell viability
  was measured by the MTT assay. The AGSgastric cancer cells were pretreated with
  PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (25 μM) for 2 h, followed by myricetin treatment (0 and
  15 μM) for 24 h. (C) and (D) The AGS cells were harvested to measure the levels
  of p-Akt, Bax and Bcl-2proteins by western blotting. The blots were also probed
  with β-actin antibody to confirm equal sample loading. The results are representative
  of three independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05 vs. untreated control group, #p < 0.05
  vs. treated myricetin group.'
