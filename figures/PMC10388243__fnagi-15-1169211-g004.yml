caption: Oxidative stress affects EGF-induced EGFR/MAPK signaling in ARPE-19 cells.
  (A) ARPE-19 cells were treated with or without 300 μM H2O2 for 3 h and then treated
  with 100 ng/mL EGF for 15, 30, or 60 min. Phosphorylated EGFR, P38MAPK, ERK, JNK,
  and β-actin were detected by western blot assay. (B) Quantitative analysis and comparison
  of western blot assay results, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
