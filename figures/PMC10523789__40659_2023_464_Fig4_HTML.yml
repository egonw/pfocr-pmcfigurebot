caption: KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of 12 DEPRGs. a The chord plot showing the
  top10 enriched KEGG pathway of DEPRGs. NOD-like receptor signaling pathway is most
  notable. b–d GO enrichment analysis, b biological process (BP), c cellular components
  (CC), d molecular function (MF). Bubble plots showing the top 10 information involved
  in each GO term. These indicate that compared with STA, IA tissue has stronger activation
  of pytoptosis pathway members, such as inflammasome complex and cysteine-type endopeptidase.
  The q value is the adjusted P value
