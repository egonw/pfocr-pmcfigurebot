caption: Cyclin D Pathway Dysregulation Induced by PAIP1 Knockdown. A Cluster analysis
  of miRNA expression in PAIP1-knockdown (KD) and negative control (NC) SMMC-7721
  xenograft tumor cells. Each row represents a unique miRNA, and each column represents
  an individual tumor sample (n = 3 tumors in each group). Red or green coloring represents
  elevated or decreased expression, respectively. B Results of the KEGG pathway analysis
  showing the top ten highest-ranking KEGG pathways. The ‘focal adhesion’ and ‘pathways
  in cancer’ pathways have been circled in red. C Representative Western blots of
  four key cyclin D pathway genes. GAPDH served as loading control. D The relative
  expression of each protein is graphically displayed. Results are displayed as means
  and standard deviations (SDs) from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
