caption: Serum proteome changes comparing anterior pediatric uveitis (n = 80) versus
  nonanterior pediatric uveitis (n = 74) patients. (A) Differential expression of
  serum proteins obtained from proximity extension assay (PEA) results. Differentially
  upregulated proteins are depicted in red, and downregulated proteins are depicted
  in blue. Proteins were analyzed using the likelihood ratio test adjusted for age
  and sex and followed by FDR multiple testing correction. The dotted line represents
  q = 0.05. NPX indicates normalized protein expression data from Olink. (B) Pathway
  enrichment analysis of the 63 differentially expressed proteins showing the top
  five using Reactome, with coloring based on the adjusted P values. (C) Heatmap of
  the 63 differentially expressed proteins between the anterior and nonanterior uveitis
  cases. The levels for each protein analyte are shown for each of the samples in
  the study and are color coded from low (cyan) to high (yellow). (D) Venn diagram
  showing overlapping and unique proteins in the four disease group comparisons (A)
  and the nonanterior versus nonanterior comparison.
