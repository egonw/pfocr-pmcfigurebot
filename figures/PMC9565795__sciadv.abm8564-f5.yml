caption: (A) Top genes for metagene_25. (B) Pathway enrichment for the top 200 genes
  in metagene_25. (C) Gene symbols for the top two enriched pathways in metagene_25.
  (D) Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves for samples with high metagene_25 levels
  versus samples with low metagene_25 levels. The cohorts were split into high and
  low groups by the median score. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was
  used to test the significance of the association. (E) The association between metagene_25
  level and CTL infiltration level in TCGA samples. The significance of association
  was determined by Spearman correlation with adjustment for tumor purity. Multiple-hypothesis
  testing was adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR). (F) Top genes for metagene_31.
  (G) Pathway enrichment for the top 200 genes in metagene_31. (H) Gene symbols for
  the top two enriched pathways in metagene_31. (I) The association between metagene_31
  level and different pathways and biomarkers (y axis) in TCGA samples. The associations
  between molecular phenotypes and pathways were computed for each cancer using Spearmanâ€™s
  partial correlation with tumor purity adjusted. The pathway expression was inferred
  by averaging the expression level of genes within that pathway. Color indicates
  the correlation coefficient (positive correlations are red and negative correlations
  are blue) and box size indicates the significance level (large box, FDR < 0.05;
  small box, not significant).
