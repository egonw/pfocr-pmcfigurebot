caption: Central role of FXI(a) in the coagulation system. Inflamed or damaged endothelial
  layer results in exposure of tissue factor and activation of platelets and neutrophils
  leading to activation of the extrinsic pathway (via FVII) or contact pathway (via
  FXII), respectively. FXI activated by either by FXIIa or the feedback loop of thrombin
  will result in further thrombin generation though the intrinsic pathway. Attenuation
  of FXI activity inhibiting either FXI or FXIa leads to reduced thrombin formation
  and venous thromboemblism (light arrows), while the extrinsic pathway and the contact
  pathway remain unaffected (dark arrows).
