figure_title: SR9009 treatment inhibited the expression of genes in the FOXM1 pathway
  and PCS1
caption: A Venn diagram of the common genes in both the FOXM1 pathway and PCS1. B
  Heatmap of FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5 expression based on
  RNA sequencing. C mRNA expression of FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and
  BIRC5 relative to diploid samples from TCGA-PRAD analysis (cBioPortal database).
  D Association of FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5 with disease-free
  survival across cancers (GEPIA database). PRAD is shown in the black frame. E, F
  qPCR validation of the expression of these seven genes after SR9009 treatment for
  48 h; n = 3; means ± SDs; ANOVA. F Western blot validation of the expression of
  these seven genes after SR9009 treatment for 48 h. G qPCR results of the effect
  of FOXM1 knockdown on CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, and CCNB2 expression; n = 3; means ± SDs;
  ANOVA. H Effect of FOXM1 overexpression and/or SR9009 treatment on the expression
  of FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
