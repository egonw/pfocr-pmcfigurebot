caption: An abbreviated cellular model of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling.
  IAA is biosynthesized from Trp via IPyA by TAA1 and YUCCA in the TAA/YUC pathway.
  IAA is transported by AUX1/LAX1, PIN, and ABCB proteins. The auxin-induced GH3 enzyme
  converts active IAA to inactive IAA-amido. Auxin induces ubiquitination and degradation
  of Aux/IAA proteins via SCFTIR1/AFB. Degradation of the Aux/IAA repressor recovers
  ARF activity to activate transcription of auxin-responsive genes.
