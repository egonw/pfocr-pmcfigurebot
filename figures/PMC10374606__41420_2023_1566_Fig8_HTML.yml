figure_title: Prx II knock-down HaCaT cells are sensitive to H2O2 stimulation
caption: This effect exerted was found to be mediated by the subsequent activation
  of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway, followed by the activation of IP3R in the
  endoplasmic reticulum that resulted in the elevation of intracytoplasmic Ca2+, which
  finally culminated in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.
