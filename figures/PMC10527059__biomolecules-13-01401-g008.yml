caption: This picture summarizes the predicted function of proteins interacting with
  circPSEN1s. It illustrates that circPSEN1s directly interact with specific proteins,
  namely FOXA1 (forkhead box A1), ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1), HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear
  factor-1 beta), BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4), GATA4 (GATA binding protein 4),
  EP300 (E1A binding protein p300), CBX3 (chromobox 3), PRDM9 (PR/SET domain 9), and
  PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). Consequently, these interactions
  predominantly influence the TGF-beta and Notch signaling pathways. Considering the
  notably elevated p-value associated with the Notch pathway and the well-established
  significance of TGF-β as a pathway indirectly regulated by circPSEN1s’ targeted
  miRNAs, we opted to give prominence to the depiction of these two pathways in the
  image. This decision is aimed at ensuring clarity and focus, avoiding unnecessary
  complexity.
