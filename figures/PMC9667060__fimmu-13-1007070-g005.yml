caption: Amlexanox-induced inhibition of L. major infection in WT THP1 cells in a
  3-day infection model. Differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with eGFP expressing
  L. major parasites at a MOI of 1:10 (macrophage:parasite). Infection percentages
  and parasite loads were quantified using a flow cytometer at the indicated time
  points. Amlexanox was added either 1 hour prior to infection or 24 h post infection
  (late amlexanox). (A) and (B) show representative flow cytometry density and histogram
  plots, corresponding to infected cell percent and parasite load, respectively. (C)
  Data presented in graphs are representative of two independent experiments with
  similar results Amlexanox was added at different time points in treated groups (purple,
  1 h pre-infection; red, 24 h post-infection). 72 h data were statistically compared
  to untreated group using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
  test. (D) Footpad swelling in L. major infected mice treated or not with amlexanox
  starting on day 41 post-infection for or a duration of 12 days. Results were based
  on digital caliper measurement of footpad depth and width of DMSO injected controls
  (n=3) and amlexanox injected (n=4) treatment group. Data were statistically compared
  using multiple unpaired t tests. ns, not significant, *p≤0.05, ***p≤0.001, ****p≤0.0001.
