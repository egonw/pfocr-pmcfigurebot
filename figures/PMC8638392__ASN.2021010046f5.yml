caption: Stimulation of sodium transport by aldosterone activates the HIF signaling
  pathway in cultured CD principal cells. mpkCCDcl4 cells were treated with aldosterone
  (1 μM) for 24 and 48 hours to stimulate active sodium transport. (A) Transepithelial
  current increased in cells treated with aldosterone (Aldo), as compared with control
  cells. Results are means±SEM from three independent experiments. (B) Upregulation
  of the aldosterone target genes, αENaC, and α (NaKα) and β subunits (NaKβ) of the
  Na,K-ATPase, assessed by real-time PCR. (C and D) HIF pathway activation in cells
  treated with aldosterone. Increased HIF1α protein abundance assessed by western
  blot. β-actin was used as a loading control. A representative experiment from three
  is shown (C). (D) Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are
  expressed as a percentage of control values (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from
  three experiments in each group. (E) Aldosterone treatment increased mRNA levels
  of the HIF target genes PDK1, PGK1, VGEF, and GLUT1 assessed by real-time PCR. Results
  are expressed as fold of control (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from three independent
  experiments. (F) Exposure to low–apical sodium medium, i.e., 15 mM (Na15), instead
  of high–apical sodium medium, i.e., 150 mM (Na150), for 6 hours decreased transepithelial
  current in mpkCCDcl4 cells treated or not with aldosterone. Results are means±SEM
  from three independent experiments. (G) Effect of aldosterone on αENaC mRNA levels
  assessed by real-time PCR in cells exposed to low (Na15) or high (Na150) apical
  sodium is unchanged. (H) HIF target genes PDK1 and PGK1 mRNA levels decreased in
  cells exposed to low–apical sodium medium (Na15), as compared with high apical sodium
  (Na150), under both control and aldosterone-treated conditions. Results are expressed
  as fold of control (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from three independent experiments.
  Unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare transepithelial currents from control
  and aldosterone-treated cells in (A). One-way ANOVA was used to compare data from
  (B), (D), (E), (F), (G), and (H). *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001, versus
  controls for (A), (B), (D), and (E).
