caption: 'GO cellular component analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (a)
  Merged top 5 GO terms enriched either in DEGs or genes highly correlated with HOXC6.
  (b) Merged top 5 KEGG pathways enriched either in DEGs or genes highly correlated
  with HOXC6. (c) Yellow circles represent the top 5 GO cellular components enriched
  in genes highly correlated with HOXC6, whereas brown circles represent the enriched
  genes. (d) KEGG pathway analysis based on genes highly correlated with HOXC6. Colored
  rectangles represent the highly correlated genes, and the color bar indicates the
  log2-fold change of genes between the high-expression group and the low-expression
  group of HOXC6. GSEA and heat map represents GSEA results. (e) GSEA was performed
  in patients sorted by HOXC6 expression value. Above: biological process, genes associated
  with positive regulation of cell cycle process, cell cycle, and mitotic cell cycle
  are enriched in patients with high levels of HOXC6 expression; center: cellular
  component, genes associated with spindle midzone, condensed nuclear chromosome,
  and condensed chromosome are enriched in patients with high levels of HOXC6 expression;
  below: KEGG pathway, genes associated with cell cycle, mismatch repair, and proteasome
  pathways are enriched in patients with high levels of HOXC6 expression. The horizontal
  bar in graded color from red to blue represents the rank ordering of patients based
  on decreasing levels of HOXC6 expression. Vertical black lines represent the projection
  of individual genes constituting relevant gene sets. (f) Heat map showing enriched
  genes from the GSEA gene sets of  in combination with the HOXC6 expression value.
  DEG: differentially expressed gene; COR: highly correlated gene.'
