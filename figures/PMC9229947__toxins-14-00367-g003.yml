caption: Effect of BEA on the Nrf2/Keap 1 signaling pathway in BRL3A cells. (A) Cells
  were treated with increasing concentrations of BEA (0, 1, 1.5 and 2 μmol/L) for
  12 h. The expression of Nrf2/Keap-1 signaling pathway-related proteins was detected
  by western blot. (B) The ratio of nuclear Nrf2/Histone H3 and expression levels
  of GST, HO-1, Keap 1, and NOQ1 in total protein extract were analyzed by ImageJ.
  (C) mRNA expression levels of antioxidant-related genes (GST, NQO1, SOD, and HO-1)
  downstream of Nrf2 signaling pathway were measured by qRT-PCR. All experiments were
  performed in triplicate (n = 3) and data were presented as the means ± SD and analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01, compared with the blank control group.
  (D) Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein in BRL3A cells was photographed by laser
  confocal fluorescence microscopy. BRL3A cell nucleus (blue), Nrf2 (green), scale
  bar = 50 μm.
