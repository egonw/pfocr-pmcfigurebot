caption: 'PF was protected by TRF via the inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway:
  WB analysis showed the expressions of fibrosis proteins induced by BLM in SD rats
  were decreased (a–f), as seen in TGF-β1 (b), Smad2 (c), Smad3 (d), Smad7 (e) and
  α-SMA (f) in the lung samples; n = 3; (g–j) Representative statistical analysis
  of TGF-β1 (g), Smad2 (h), Smad3 (i) and Smad7 (j) in mRNA by RT-qPCR; n = 3. Note:
  * represents p < 0.05 in comparison to the control group; # represents p < 0.05
  in comparison to the model group.'
