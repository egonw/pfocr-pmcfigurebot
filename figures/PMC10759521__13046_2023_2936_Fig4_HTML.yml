caption: DCAF13 knockdown promotes p53 protein and its downstream target gene expression.
  (A) The mRNA expression of DCAF13, TP53, CDKN1A, BAX, BBC3, CYCS, FAS, PERP and
  PIDD1 were detected by RT-qPCR in A549 or SPC-A1 cells transfected with the indicated
  siRNAs or overexpression plasmids (si13 means siRNA for DCAF13). (B) The mRNA expression
  of DCAF13, CDKN1A, BAX, BBC3, CYCS, FAS, PERP, and PIDD1 were detected by RT-qPCR
  in NCI-H1299 cells transfected with siControl or the indicated siRNAs. GAPDH was
  used as a control. Student’s t-test was used. Data presented as mean ± SD, n = 3,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. C-F. Correlation between DCAF13 and
  CDKN1A, BBC3, FAS, PIDD1 mRNA expression in TCGA LUAD and GTEx samples by GEPIA2
  (Spearman correlation coefficient). G-H. Protein expression levels of p53, p21,
  BAX, FAS were analyzed by Western blotting in A549 or SPC-A1 cells transfected with
  the indicated siRNAs or overexpression plasmids. GAPDH was used as a control
