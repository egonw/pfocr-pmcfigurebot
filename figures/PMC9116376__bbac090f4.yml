caption: 'High expression of the Nrf2–ARE pathway correlates with poor prognosis and
  KEAP1 mutation in lung cancers. The survival curves (A) and forest plot (B), censored
  at 10 years, show correlation between high expression of the Nrf2–ARE pathway (WikiPathways:
  WP4357) and poor prognosis in TCGA-LUAD cases (P = 0.00015, P.adj < 0.01, KM log-rank;
  HR = 1.84, P = 0.00027, P.adj < 0.01, Cox PH likelihood ratio). Shades reflect 95%
  confidence intervals in survival curves in (A). The density and box plots show lung
  cancer cell lines with an inactivating KEAP1 mutation (red) being more sensitive
  to NFE2L2 CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (P = 4.1e−07, two-tailed Wilcoxon test) (C, D) and
  RNAi knockdown (P = 8.4e−05, two-tailed Wilcoxon test) (E, F). ARE, antioxidant
  response element; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; P, P-value; P.adj, adjusted P-value;
  KM, Kaplan–Meier; HR, hazard ratio; PH, proportional-hazard; RNAi, RNA interference;
  Chronos, an algorithm for inferring gene knockout fitness effects; DEMETER2, gene
  dependency estimates for RNAi datasets.'
