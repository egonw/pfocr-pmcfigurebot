caption: Over−expression of G6PD impaired skeletal muscle cells’ response to insulin.
  (a) Western blot analysis for G6PD, GLUT4 and insulin signaling pathway associated
  protein after G6PD over-expression with or without 100 nM insulin. (b) Immunofluorescence
  assay of GLUT4 translocation on cell membrane after G6PD over-expression under 100
  nM insulin; GLUT4 was stained as red, Laminin was stained as green and cell nuclei
  were stained as blue; scale bar = 50 μm. (c,d) Flow cytometry assay of GLUT4 translocation
  on cell membrane after G6PD over-expression under 100 nM insulin. (e,f) Flow cytometry
  assay for glucose uptake detection after G6PD over-expression by 2-NBDG under 100
  nM insulin. * p < 0.05.
