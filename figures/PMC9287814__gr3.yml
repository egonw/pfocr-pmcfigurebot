caption: Model selection and parameter estimation(A) Whisker plots associated with
  random parameter set (), optimized parameter set using an evolutionary genetic algorithm
  (), and parameter set () sampled with MCMC algorithm ().(B and C) Whisker plots
  of the concentration ratio  for the model ensemble  (red) as compared with the mean
  and SD of experimental values (black). (C) Whisker plots of a subset of normalized
  reaction fluxes  for the model ensemble  ( in blue and  in red) as compared with
  the mean and SD of estimated values (black).(D) Violin plots of parameters for the
  model ensemble  where the explored parameter space is represented in white (non-gray).
