caption: The action network of maladjusted genes in blood or skin at different burn
  times. (A) Crosstalk of maladjusted genes in blood or skin at different burn times.
  (B) Blood and skin specific genes participate in the signaling pathway at different
  times after burn. The connection represents the crosstalk between the groups. In
  the outer circle, red represents upregulation and blue represents downregulation.
  (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of hub genes involved. FDR,
  false discovery rate.
