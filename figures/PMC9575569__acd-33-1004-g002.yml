caption: GNG5 knockdown inhibited BC cell invasion and proliferation. (a) GNG5 expression
  within BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells was measured through WB assay. (b) Absorbance
  of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells was measured at 450 nm wavelength at 0, 24, 48 and
  72 h in different groups by CCK-8 assay. (c) Clone forming assay was conducted to
  measure colonies formed in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. (d and e) Transwell detects
  the ability of different groups of cells to migrate and invade. (f) WB assay was
  conducted to determine different groups of EMT of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. (g)
  WB assay was conducted to measure cyclinD1, active-β -catenin and c-myC levels within
  BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells from diverse groups. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
  BC, breast cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; GNG5, G protein subunit gamma 5;
