figure_title: Contribution of glycolysis and mitochondrial activities to retinal metabolism
  and CNTF-induced metabolic changes
caption: a Schematic illustration of the glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle with glucose
  as a fuel. Enzymatic steps affected by specific inhibitors are indicated (red circle).
  b–d Metabolomics heatmaps show the effects of inhibitors in WT, rds, and rds retinas
  treated with LV-IG or LV-CNTF on metabolites. b amino acids. c fatty acid synthesis
  intermediates. d energy currency-related metabolites. e–m Bar graphs show the effects
  of inhibitors on the levels of ATP (e, h), lactate in the tissue (i), acetyl-CoA
  (f, k), TCA cycle metabolites (g, j, l), and GSH (m). Viral vector treatment periods
  are shown below treated rds samples. For e–m, data were presented as mean ± SEM.
  Independent sample numbers (N) are indicated within the bars. Two-way ANOVA and
  Tukey’s multiple comparison test were applied to the entire group. For clarity,
  only significant adjusted P values for pairs of samples with and without a given
  inhibitor are shown with P < 0.0001 indicated as ****. See Source Data for the entire
  statistical analysis.
