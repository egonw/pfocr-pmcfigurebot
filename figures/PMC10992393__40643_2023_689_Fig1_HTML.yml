caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway for nervonic acid production in the yeast Y. lipolytica.
  Nervonic acid is biosynthesized from the initiation unit of acetyl-CoA and the extension
  unit of malonyl-CoA with fatty acid synthetase. Green words represent the heterogeneous
  expression pathways; black words represent the native pathways; and red words represent
  selected for disruption in this study. Pyr: pyruvic acid; Ac-CoA: acetyl coenzyme
  A; CIT: citric acid; Mal-CoA: Malonyl coenzyme A; FAS: fatty acid synthase; TE:
  thioesterase; ACL: ATP citrate lyase; FAA1: acyl-CoA synthetase; FFA: free fatty
  acid; KS: ketoacyl-CoA synthase; KR: 3-ketoacyl-CoAreductase; DH: 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydratase; ER: enoyl-CoA reductase; D15D: âˆ†15 desaturase; TAG: triacylglycerol'
