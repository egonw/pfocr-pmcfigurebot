caption: 'ALDH2 inhibits myocardial pyroptosis through NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling
  pathway. (A-F) Representative immunoblots and quantification of N-GSDMD, GSDMD,
  NLRP3 and caspase-1 p20 protein in LPS-stimulated Aldh2 −/− and WT mice (GAPDH;
  loading control), n = 3-4 per group. (G) Representative immunofluorescence tissue
  images showing caspase-1 (green) and DAPI (blue), scale bar: 50 μm. (H) Representative
  immunohistochemical images showing caspase-1 (brown), scale bar: 50 μm. (I–L) H9C2
  cells were stimulated by LPS plus ATP with or without pre-treated Alda-1. (I) Representative
  immunofluorescence images showing caspase-1 (green) and DAPI (blue), scale bar:
  100 μm. (J,K) Representative flow cytometry graphs showing positive-caspase-1/PI
  double staining and the quantitative analysis of the double positive, n = 3 per
  group. (L) Representative immunofluorescence images showing NLRP3/ASC speck, scale
  bar: 25 μm. Mean ± SEM. ****p < 0.0001; ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; ns
  = not significant.'
