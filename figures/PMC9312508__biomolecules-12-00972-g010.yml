caption: SARS-CoV induced immune response in host cells. Host cell detect virus invasion
  mainly by TLRs and RIG1-/MDA5 and lead to type I IFN signaling pathway. The receptor
  IFNAR senses type I IFN and leads to the JAK1-STAT signaling pathway, which expresses
  antiviral proteins and bring neighboring cell into anti-virus state. The ORF6 suppresses
  type I IFN expression by inhibiting translocation of STAT1+STAT2+IRF9 complex into
  nucleus. The ORF 6, 3b, N, and 8b/ab also inhibit the expression of type I IFN by
  blocking IRF3/7.
