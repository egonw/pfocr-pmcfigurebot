caption: 'SphK1 was highly expressed in rat myocardium after MI. (a) Myocardial ischemic
  area of rats was increased from 1to 14 days. (b–d) LVEF, LVFS, and E/A of rats decreased
  from 1 to 14 days. (e, f) HE staining and Masson trichrome staining of rat myocardium
  (200x). (g) IHC staining results showed that the expression of SphK1 and S1P in
  rat myocardium (200x) increased from 1 to 14 days. (h, i) mRNA expression of SphK1
  and S1P in rat myocardium increased from 1 to 14 days. (“∗” means p < 0.05 vs. the
  sham group), based on Student''s t-test. Scale bar: 50 μm.'
