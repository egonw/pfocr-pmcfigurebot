figure_title: CftrPKO and CFTRinh-172 platelets display enhanced aggregation and ATP
  release
caption: a–e Aggregation or ATP release of washed CftrPKO and Ctrl platelets were
  stimulated with different concentrations of ADP (2.5, 5, or 10 μM) (a), thrombin
  (0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 U/mL) (b, c) and collagen (0.5 μg/mL) (d, e) at 37 °C under
  constant stirring. Representative tracings (left) and quantification graphs (right)
  are presented. (n = 5–10 mice per group; unpaired t test). f–h, WT mice were intravenously
  administered CFTRinh-172 (2 mg/kg every day, 24 h) or the same volume of normal
  saline containing DSMO as a control before stimulation. Washed platelets were stimulated
  with different concentrations of ADP (2.5, 5, or 10 μM) (f) and thrombin (0.01,
  0.02, or 0.05 U/mL) (g, h) at 37 °C under constant stirring. Platelet aggregation
  and ATP release were monitored using an aggregometer. Representative tracings (left)
  and quantification graphs (right) were presented. (n = 5–6 mice per group; unpaired
  t test). Data are shown as mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and
  ****P < 0.0001. ns not significant
