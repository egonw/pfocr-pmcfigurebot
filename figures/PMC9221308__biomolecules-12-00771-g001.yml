caption: Effects of exposure to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush
  on the amount of collagenous and non-collagenous proteins in cultured cell layers.
  HGnFs were exposed to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush for 5 days.
  Collagenous (red) and non-collagenous (green) proteins were examined by Sirius red
  and Fast green staining on day 5 of culture (a), and quantitative analysis (b) was
  conducted using the stain extraction buffer. Each bar indicates mean Â± standard
  deviation (SD) of five independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 (vs. control).
