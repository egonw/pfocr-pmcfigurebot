figure_title: Differential effects of IF regimen functional processes
caption: (a) Functional transition network that shows functional remodeling of heart
  proteome in response to IF12 (a), IF16 (b), and EOD (c) GSEA for biological processes
  and pathways performed for each IF regimen comparison is shown as an enrichment
  map. Functions significantly enriched (p<0.01, nominal p-value from empirical phenotype-based
  permutation test in GSEA) among the upregulated and downregulated proteins for each
  comparison are indicated by red and blue nodes, respectively. The size of the nodes
  indicates the number of proteins within the node and edges link nodes that share
  common proteins. (d) Functional processes and pathways altered by changes in transcriptome
  and proteome abundances through different IF regimens (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR <0.05,
  2-D annotation enrichment using MANOVA test). Each dot on the plot represents a
  modulation in pathway or process. The scores indicate abundance changes of transcriptome
  or proteome levels over AL. Upregulation and downregulation of components are denoted
  by positive and negative scores, respectively. n=4â€“5 mice in each experimental group.
