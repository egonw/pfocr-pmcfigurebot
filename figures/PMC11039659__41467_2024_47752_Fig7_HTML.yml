figure_title: Distinct metabolites are identified in Lotus root exudates grown in
  symbiotic, starved, or inorganic-nitrogen conditions
caption: a PCA analysis of the chemical features identified in root exudates; the
  nitrogen nutritional status of samples is marked by colors. b Barplot illustrates
  the absolute abundance of chemical features in each of the nutritional status. The
  mean intensity of chemical features within samples is shown. c Boxplot shows the
  abundance of metabolite intensity within the individual pathway (median, 75th percentile,
  and 25th percentile), and statistical analysis is conducted within the individual
  pathway (p < 0.05, n = 6 biologically independent samples). d Ternary plot illustrates
  statistically enriched features in the three nitrogen nutritional status, donut
  plots at each corner of the triangle show the composition of metabolite intensity
  at the pathway level. e Heatmap shows enriched chemical compounds identified according
  to the nitrogen nutritional status. The chemical compound intensity in each of the
  samples is illustrated by color intensity.
