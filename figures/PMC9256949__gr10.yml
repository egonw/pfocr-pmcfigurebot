caption: 'Immunohistochemical staining of in vivo critical bone repair and validation
  of the signaling pathway of the osteogenic effect of nanohybrid 5QCS-1GO-PDA. (A)
  OCN-stained images were obtained at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after implantation, and
  brown positive staining (red arrows) was observed in bone lacunaes. (B–C) Western
  blotting was used to detect the expression of BMP2, BMPR1B, BMPR2, p-Smad1/5/8,
  Smad1/5/8 and Runx2 proteins in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 5QCS-1GO-PDA (25, 50
  and 75 μg/mL). All results were repeated three times. Scale bar: 250 μm or 50 μm.
  Data are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).'
