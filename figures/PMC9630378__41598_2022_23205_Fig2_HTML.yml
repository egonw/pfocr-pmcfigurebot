caption: Identification of PMVK as a novel miR-874 target in breast cancer cells.
  (a,b) Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays
  were used to analyse the effects of miR-874 on PMVK mRNA and SREBF2 mRNA in MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
  (one-way ANOVA). (c,d) Western blotting for PMVK, SREBP2, and actin in MCF-7 and
  MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with cont miRNA or miR-874 for 72 h. Triangles indicate
  specific bands, and asterisks indicate nonspecific bands. (e) Bioinformatic analysis
  using TargetScan predicted that miR-874 might target both the PMVK 3′-UTR and the
  SREBF2 3’-UTR. (f) Putative miR-874 sites in the 3′-UTR of PMVK, as determined by
  the STarMir program. (g) p53/c-Myc double-knockout (DKO) MCF-7 cells were transfected
  with the PMVK 3′-UTR in a vector construct and miR-874 or control (cont) miRNA to
  analyse the effects on luciferase activity in the psiCHECK-2-PMVK-3′-UTR reporter.
  n = 3. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
  (h) Putative miR-874 sites in the 3′-UTR of SREBF2, as determined by the STarMir
  program. (i) p53/c-Myc DKO MCF-7 cells were transfected with the SREBF2 3′-UTR in
  a vector construct and miR-874 or cont miRNA to analyse the effects on luciferase
  activity in the psiCHECK-2-SREBF2-3′-UTR reporter. n = 6. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. **p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
