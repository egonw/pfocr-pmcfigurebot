caption: Total Ire1 protein levels in picornavirus-infected HeLa cells analyzed on
  Western blots using different antibodies. (A) Ire1 levels in PV-infected HeLa cells
  visualized using anti-Ire1 polyclonal antibodies from Sigma (#I6785). (B) Ire1 levels
  in CVB-infected HeLa cells visualized using the same antibodies (#I6785). (C) Ire1
  levels in PV-infected HeLa cells visualized using an anti-Ire1 polyclonal antibody
  from Abcam (#ab37073). (D) Ire1 levels in EMCV-infected HeLa cells visualized on
  Western blots using antibodies from Abcam. Representative results of at least three
  independent experiments are shown. Ire1-FL—the full-length Ire1; Ire1-Cl—products
  of Ire1 proteolytic cleavage; *—non-specific signals.
