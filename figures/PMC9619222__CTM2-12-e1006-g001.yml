caption: Analysis of metabolites in the cohorts. (A) Flow chart of the study of metabolome
  and sequential analysis. (B) The OPLS‐DA scatter plots based on the metabolic profiles
  of two groups in the discovery cohort. Model overview and permutation were also
  displayed. R 2Y = .899 and Q 2 = .59. (C) Volcano plot of univariate statistics
  and VIP. The threshold value for univariate statistics is p < .05; metabolites of
  variable importance in projection (VIP) scores > 1. Significantly altered metabolites
  are highlighted in red (increased) and blue (decreased). (D) Enrichment analysis
  of differential metabolites. (E) Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG)
  pathway of differential metabolites. (F) Violin plots of significantly different
  metabolites confirmed, red indicates the control group, and blue indicates the premature
  ovarian insufficiency (POI) group. (G) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of
  potential biomarkers. (A) Potential biomarkers with area under curve (AUC) > .7
  (left, increased; right, decreased). (H) The most potential biomarker combinations
  (left, NADH and acetoacetate; right, hyodeoxycholic acid [HDCA] and acetoacetate)
