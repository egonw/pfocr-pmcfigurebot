caption: Overexpression of NRSN2 reversed the inhibitory effect of EVs on proliferation,
  migration, and invasion of OS cells. The NRSN2 was overexpressed when the OS cells
  were treated with EVs. A) RT-qPCR demonstrated that the level of NRSN2 mRNA was
  increased. B) EdU assay showed that the proliferation rate was increased. C) Flow
  cytometry showed that apoptosis was reduced. D) Transwell assay showed that cell
  migration (above) and invasion (below) were increased. Three cell tests were performed
  and the data were expressed as mean Â± SD. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison
  among groups. Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used for post-hoc test; **p<0.01.
