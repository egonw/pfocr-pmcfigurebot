caption: circ_0008726 suppressesd HTR8/SVneo cell growth, migration, and invasion
  by targeting miR‐1290. (A) The viability of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was analyzed by CCK‐8
  assay. (B) The migratory potential of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was determined by wound
  healing test. (C) The invasion ability of HTR‐8/SVneo cells was examined by Transwell
  assay. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Hsa_circ_0008726 regulates the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of trophoblast cells in preeclampsia through modulating the miR‐1290‐LHX6 signaling
  pathway.
