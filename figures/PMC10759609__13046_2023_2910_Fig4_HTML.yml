caption: CY12-RP2 suppresses the invasion and migration of melanoma cells via blocking
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A The effect of CY12-RP2 on the colony formation of melanoma
  cell lines. B The colony formation statistical analysis. C Effects of CY12-RP2 on
  the migratory capacity of melanoma cell lines were analyzed by wound healing assay.
  The power field scale bar, 100 μm. D Statistical analysis was performed to determine
  the migrated distance. E Effects of CY12-RP2 on the invasive ability of melanoma
  cell lines were analyzed by transwell assays. The power field scale bar, 100 μm.
  F Statistical analysis was performed to determine the number of invaded cells. G
  The analysis of CY12-RP2 on EMT and apoptosis signaling pathways by using Western
  blot assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
