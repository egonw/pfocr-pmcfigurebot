figure_title: A summary of statistically significant correlations between various
  quantities comprising the Radiation-Subsidence and Stability-Subsidence Pathways
caption: The correlations summarize the results shown in Figs.Â , , , and  among the
  CMIP6 multi-model ensemble. The Radiation-Subsidence Pathway is shown in blue, whereas
  the Stability-Subsidence Pathway is shown in orange. The direction of the arrows
  signifies suggested pathways of causality. Red values are Pearson correlation coefficients.
  All correlations are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.
