caption: 'The effect of direct MLCK inhibition and calcium/calmodulin-dependent MLCK
  inhibition on LSEC fenestrations. (A) A schematic presentation of the ML-7 effect.
  MLC is partially dephosphorylated (faded-red colour) by direct MLCK inhibition.
  Phosphorylation by Rho/ROCK pathway still occurs. (B) A representative SEM image
  of LSEC treated with 20 µM of ML-7. The inset highlights a small sieve plate with
  enlarged fenestrations. (C) Fenestration diameter distribution (fenestrations measured:
  ctrl-22618, 1 µM ML-7-8283, 5 µM ML-7-12560, 10 µM ML-7-4630, 20 µM ML-7-870, 10
  µM ML-7 (rinsed)-6607). The proportion of fenestrations > 200 nm is 7% (ctrl), 7%
  (1 µM ML-7), 15% (5 µM ML-7), 24% (10 µM ML-7), 38% (20 µM ML-7), and 14% (10 µM
  ML-7, rinsed). (D) Changes in the porosity relative to the control are presented
  (n = 3–6). MLCK inhibition by ML-7 resulted in a significant and dose-dependent
  decrease in porosity; the effect is not reduced by CytB. (E) A schematic presentation
  of calcium/calmodulin-dependent inhibition of MLCK. MLCK activation by PKC and PKG
  still occurs. MLC phosphorylation remains unchanged. (F) Representative SEM image
  of LSEC treated with 20 µM KN93+CytB. The inset highlights fenestrations gathered
  in the sieve plate, showing a similar response to the effect of CytB alone (presented
  SEM images are in the same scale). (G) Fenestration size distribution after calcium/calmodulin
  inhibition (number of fenestrations measured: ctrl-6341, KN93-5306, KN93+CytB-5830,
  cytB-35677). The proportion of fenestrations > 200 nm is similar to the control
  (ctrl-14%, KN93-14%, KN93+CytB-11%, CytB-4%). (H) A change in porosity relative
  to the control is presented (n = 3). The calcium/calmodulin inhibition resulted
  in a significant decrease in porosity; the effect of KN93 does not hamper the increase
  in porosity caused by CytB. (I) A fluorescence signal for pMLC and ppMLC measured
  using SIM for individual well-spread (fenestrated) LSEC. * p < 0.01, relative to
  the control.'
