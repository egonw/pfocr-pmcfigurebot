caption: The effects of UA or EPI on cell viability were determined by CCK-8 assay.
  (A) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of
  UA for 24 h. (B) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of EPI for 24 h. The means and SEM were shown. n = 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and
  *** p < 0.001 versus cells without drug treatment in the absence of any treatments.
