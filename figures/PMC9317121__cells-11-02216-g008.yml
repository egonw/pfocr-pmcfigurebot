caption: Dmp1 and Dspp expression patterns in developing teeth. By in situ hybridization
  assay, Dmp1 mRNA transcription was clearly detected in odontoblasts near the dental
  crown and root of the mouse tooth and osteoblasts in alveolar bones by PN 1, while
  by PN 5, Dmp1 expression was downregulated in odontoblasts and only appeared in
  odontoblasts located at the dental root but was highly intense in the alveolar bone.
  By PN 10–14, Dmp1 transcription was weakly visible in odontoblasts, but still highly
  expressed in osteoblasts in alveolar bones. By PN 1, Dspp transcripts were evident
  in odontoblasts, dental papilla, and pre-ameloblasts in the mouse mandibular molars.
  By PN 5, Dspp mRNA was strongly expressed in odontoblasts and weakly seen in ameloblasts
  and dental pulp cells. From PN 10 to 14, Dspp mRNA was mainly expressed in odontoblasts
  and weakly in dental pulp cells. Dspp expression was barely detected in osteoblasts
  in alveolar bone from PN 1 to PN 14 during mouse tooth development. ab, alveolar
