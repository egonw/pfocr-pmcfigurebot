caption: 'The effect of RA on the liver and kidney function indices ALT, AST, BUN,
  and CRE in CP-induced ALI mice. The expression levels of the liver function indices
  AST and ALT (a,b) and the kidney function indices BUN and CRE (c,d) were detected
  by ELISA. These experiments were repeated three times. ** and ## denote highly significant
  differences (p < 0.01) compared with the control and CP model groups, respectively.'
