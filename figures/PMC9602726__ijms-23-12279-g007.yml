caption: GDF11 activated PI3K-Akt pathway via ALK5. (A) GDF11 activated PI3K-Akt pathway.
  PC12 cells were treated or untreated with 100 ng/mL for 24 h and analyzed by western
  blot. (B) Histogram of (A). (C) Cell proliferation assessment in PC12 cells incubated
  with SB431542 (20 μM) or LY294002 (1 μM). (D) Protein and phosphorylation levels
  of AKT, p-AKT, Smad2/3 and p-SMAD2/3 in PC12 cells treated or untreated wtihGDF11
  (100 ng/mL), SB431542 (20 μM) or LY294002 (1 μM) for 5 h. (E) Quantitative analysis
  of (D). (F) The apoptosis-related proteins were detected by western blot. (G,H)
  were Quantitative analysis of (F). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
