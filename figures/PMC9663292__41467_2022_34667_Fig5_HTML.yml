figure_title: Microbial gene-families and pathways with functional relevance to PD
caption: 'Analysis included N = 724 biologically independent samples from 490 PD and
  234 neurologically healthy control (NHC) subjects. Overall, 15% of microbial gene-families
  (KO groups) and 30% of pathways (MetaCyc) tested were elevated or depleted in PD,
  a conservative estimate derived from consensus at FDR < 0.05 by two statistical
  methods (MaAsLin2 and ANCOM-BC) (Supplementary Data , ). Examples are shown here,
  grouped by inferred functional relevance to PD (left panel). Data show increased
  levels of microbial activities that could contribute to PD pathogenesis (immunogenicity,
  alpha-synuclein aggregation, and creation of toxic metabolites), and reduced levels
  of protective mechanisms (anti-inflammation, and neuroactive and neuroprotective
  molecules). a Relative abundances (used in MaAsLin2). b Bias-corrected observed
  abundances (used in ANCOM-BC). c Fold change in PD vs. NHC as estimated by MaAsLin2
  and ANCOM-BC. Y-axis: KO groups (identifiers begin with “K”, gene symbol in parentheses)
  and pathways (“PWY”). X-axis: Log2 transformed relative abundances (used in MaAsLin2)
  (a), or natural log transformed bias-corrected observed abundances (used in ANCOM-BC)
  (b), with untransformed relative abundances in parenthesis for easier interpretation;
  (c) fold change in differential abundance in PD vs. NHC (squares and circles) with
  95% confidence interval (CI; solid and dashed lines), calculated from beta and standard
  errors estimated by MaAsLin2 and ANCOM-BC. Content in (a and b): Boxplots show frequency
  distribution of each KO and pathway in PD (blue green) and NHC (orange) metagenomes.
  Left, middle, and right vertical boundaries of each box represent first, second
  (median), and third quartiles of the data. The absence of a box indicates >75% of
  samples had zero abundance. The lines extending from the two ends of each box represent
  1.5x outside the interquartile range (range=(abundance value at 75% minus abundance
  value at 25%)x1.5). Points beyond the lines are outlier samples. Content in (c):
  Fold change difference between PD and NHC in log2-transformed relative abundance
  (square with solid line of 95% CI, MaAsLin2), or natural log transformed bias-corrected
  observed abundances (circle with dotted line of 95% CI, ANCOM-BC). Blue: elevated
  in PD, red: reduced in PD. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide. LTA: Lipoteichoic acid. BLP:
  murein/bacterial lipoprotein. SCFA: short-chain fatty-acid. TMA: Trimethylamine.'
