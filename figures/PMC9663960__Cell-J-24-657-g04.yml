caption: Effect of PRDX1 knock-down on apoptosis and mitochondrial fission machinery
  of HCC cells. A. Western results showed that knock-down of PRDX1 significantly enhanced
  expression of Drp1, Fis1 and Dyn2 in hepatoma cells. B. Images and graphs showed
  that overexpression of PRDX1 decreased apoptotic proteins (Bim, cytochrome C and
  Apaf-1) expression level, while knock-down of this gene significantly enhanced expression
  of caspase proteins. The right panel shows quantifications of protein levels. The
  experiment was repeated three times. Data represent mean Â± SEM. **; P<0.01, and
  ***; P<0.001.
