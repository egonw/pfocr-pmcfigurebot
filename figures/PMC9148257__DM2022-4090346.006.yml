caption: Deguelin inhibited tumor growth by upregulating PTEN and KLF4 expressions
  in mice model with NSCLC cells. (a) On day 21, the tumors were carefully dissected
  from the mice, and the tumor size was measured. (b) The expression levels of KLF4
  and PTEN proteins in tumors were detected. (c and d) The relative band intensity
  of KLF4 and PTEN in tumors were detected. β-Actin was used as an internal control.
  All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
