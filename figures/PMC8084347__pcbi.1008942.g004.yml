figure_title: Metabolic pathway activity identifies anti-cancer drug sensitivity independent
  of cell culture medium
caption: A) Schematic representing the strategy used to integrate metabolic pathway
  activity with drug response screens. Cancer cell lines were separately processed
  by culture type and culture medium with a focus on adherent cell lines. All correlation
  p-values were FDR corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction. B-E) Scatter
  plots of significant drug:metabolic pathway combinations (FDR < 0.05) in both DMEM
  and RPMI mediums. Correlation coefficients and FDR corrected p-values are shown
  for each correlation. The annotated gene target of each drug is listed below the
  drug name. The remaining significant associations are listed in .
