caption: Expression of miR-874 in MCF-7 cells significantly downregulates the mevalonate
  pathway. (a) Experimental RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) scheme applied to WT, p53 KO
  and p53/c-Myc DKO MCF-7 cells and subsequent data analysis. (b) WikiPathway enrichment
  analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Top 10 pathways revealed by WikiPathway
  2021 enrichment analysis of DEGs induced by miR-874 transfection using the top 300
  upregulated genes and the top 300 downregulated genes with FPKM > 1 in WT MCF-7
  cells. p values (Fisher’s exact test) are presented after the column. Pathways associated
  with the DNA damage response, apoptosis, and p53 are indicated in bold. (c) The
  top seven and six transcription factors of up- and downregulated mRNA transcripts,
  respectively, upon miR-874 overexpression in WT MCF-7 cells were analysed by TRRUST,
  and p values (Fisher’s exact test) are presented after the column. p53 and Myc are
  shown in bold. (d) Top five pathways of WT MCF-7-specific up- and downregulated
  DEGs induced by miR-874 transfection were analysed by WikiPathway 2021. p values
  (Fisher’s exact test) are presented after the column. Pathways associated with the
  DNA damage response, p53, and the mevalonate pathway are shown in bold. (e) The
  mevalonate pathway (WP3963) from WikiPathways is shown. Downregulated genes are
  surrounded by red squares. (f) The top 15 upregulated and downregulated genes between
  WT, p53 KO and p53/c-Myc DKO cells transfected with cont miRNA and miR-874 are listed
  in the heatmap using hierarchical clustering. PPP1CA, framed in red, is shown as
  a positive control because it is a previously reported target gene of miR-874.
