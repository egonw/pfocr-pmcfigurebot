caption: ERα-NRF1-OMI involved in regulating parkin expression. (A,B) Western blot
  analysis of OMI in A7r5 cells transfected with different OMI of adenoviruses (A)
  or siRNA (B) expressing OMI. (C,D) Western blot analysis of Parkin and OMI protein
  levels in total cell lysis (left), cytoplasm (middle) and mitochondria (right) of
  A7r5 cells treated with FBS, transfected with adenoviruses expressing OMI or noncoding
  control (C) and with adenoviruses expressing OMI or noncoding control (D). (E) Western
  blot analysis of parkin and OMI protein levels in HEK293 cells. The cells were transfected
  with Parkin and OMI vector, and treated with MG132 and/or leupeptin. (F,G) Expression
  of OMI promoted Parkin stability via the proteasomal pathway. HEK293 Cells were
  transfected with Parkin alone [(F); top panel], Parkin and OMI [(F); middle panel],
  or Parkin and OMI with MG132 treatment [(F); bottom panel], and levels of Parkin
  were detected by western blot analysis. The representative bolt (F) and quantitation
  of 3 independent experiments are shown (G). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001
  vs. control.
