caption: Overview of the formation and impact of AGEs. Proteins in the blood, such
  as albumin and hemoglobin, react with plasma glucose and generate glycated proteins
  including fructosamine and HbA1c, leading to the formation of AGEs through non-enzymatic
  glycation. The AGE formation process is restricted by FN3K, which is similar in
  structure to FN3KRP. The high level of AGEs can induce multiple diseases such as
  cancer, diabetes mellitus, vascular system dysfunction and infertility and interacts
  with the TGF- β signaling pathway. In our study, we indicated the association between
  FN3KRP rs1046875 G>A and RPL. Therefore, we propose that FN3KRP may inhibit the
  formation of AGEs and affect the RPL, infertility diseases.
