caption: Inhibition of the TGF-β pathway reverses the tumor-promoting biological effects
  mediated by M2-MDEs. (a) Western blot detection of protein expressions of TGF-β1,
  p-Smad3, Smad3, p-Smad2, and Smad2. (b) The expressions of Smad2 and Smad3 in nuclear
  and cytoplasmic protein fractions, respectively, were detected by western blotting.
  β-Tubulin and lamin B1 serve as house-keeping genes for cytoplasmic and nuclear
  proteins, respectively. (c) Detection of cell viability of IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN
  cells by CCK-8 assay. (d) EdU staining was used to label tumor cells in the proliferating
  state, and the EdU+ cell ratio was detected by flow cytometry. (e) Western blotting
  for the expressions of EMT-related genes. (f) Transwell chambers were used to detect
  tumor cell migration ability. (g) Transwell chambers preincubated with Matrigel
  were used to assess tumor cell invasiveness. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
