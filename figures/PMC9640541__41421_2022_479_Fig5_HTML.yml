figure_title: Proteogenomic insights into the Basal subtype reveal enhanced neuroendocrine
  properties
caption: a Volcano plot showing differences in protein abundance between the Basal
  subtype and other subtypes (Student’s t-test). Representative KEGG pathways for
  > 2-fold upregulated and downregulated proteins are listed. b Bar plots showing
  representative enriched Reactome pathways using 138 significantly upregulated phosphoproteins
  in the Basal subtype. c Heatmap showing the abundance of phosphosites involved in
  the Reactome pathway Vesicle-mediated transport across the three proteomic subtypes.
  d Heatmaps showing the cis-effect of DNA methylation on cognate mRNA and protein
  abundance in four neurotransmitter conduction-related genes (NCAM1, VAMP4, CADM1,
  CALML3) in Basal tumors. Methylation level (β-value), mRNA abundance (FPKM) and
  protein abundances were displayed in this heatmap after normalization by row Z-score.
  e Scatter plot showing the correlation between the abundance of CAMK2B protein and
  CAMK2B T287 phosphosite. Pearson’s R and P-values are shown within the plot. f Differential
  mRNA and protein abundance of MTC-specific biomarkers and broad-spectrum neuroendocrine
  markers between the Basal subtype and other subtypes. P-values are calculated by
  Student’s t-test for global proteomic data, or calculated by DESeq2 based on the
  negative binomial distribution for RNA-Seq data. The right panel shows the –log10-transformed
  P-values of the two omics (upper bar for proteomic data, lower bar for RNA-Seq data).
  g Heatmap showing the abundance of 67 candidate drug target proteins of the Basal
  subtype. See also Supplementary Table .
