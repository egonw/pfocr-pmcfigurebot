caption: 'circLDLR regulates the SIRT1-autophagy signaling pathway to alleviate cells’
  lipid accumulation. A The SIRT1 mRNA expression in Hepa1-6 cells. ***P < 0.001 vs.
  NC siRNA group. B The SIRT1 protein level in Hepa1-6 cells was determined using
  western blot. ***P < 0.001 vs. NC siRNA group. C ORO staining was determined to
  study the lipogenesis of si-SIRT1 in Hepa1-6 cells. **P < 0.01 vs. NC group. D and
  E The TG and TC contents in Hepa1-6 cells were detected via an enzymatic method.
  *P < 0.05 vs. NC group; #P < 0.05 vs. vector group. F LC3 and p62 expressions in
  Hepa1-6 cells were determined through western blot and relative quantification.
  *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 vs. vector group; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. circLDLR
  OE group; &&P < 0.01, &&&P < 0.001 vs. vector + si-SIRT1 group'
