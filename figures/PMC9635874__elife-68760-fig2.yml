figure_title: CeA-PKCδ inhibitory projections to the ZI (A) Schematic drawing of retrograde
  tracing experimental approach (left panel)
caption: 'Fluorescently tagged cholera toxin B (CTB-647) was injected into the ZI
  of a PKCδ-cre::Ai9 mouse brain. A representative coronal brain slice depicting the
  focal injection of CTB-647 (cyan) into the ZI is shown in the middle panel. A representative
  coronal brain slice containing the CeA is shown in the right panel. PKCδ-tdTomato
  cells are shown in red. The white square delineates the area magnified in panel
  B. Scale bar represents 1000 µm. (B) Representative high magnification images of
  the CeA in a PKCδ-cre::Ai9 mouse injected with CTB-647 into the ZI. CTB-positive
  cells are shown in cyan and PKCδ-tdTomato cells in red. The merged image is shown
  on the right. Lower insets show higher magnification images of the area delineated
  by the white squares in the top panel. Arrowheads highlight cells that are positive
  for CTB and PKCδ-tdTomato. Scale bars represent 100 µm (top panel) and 10 µm (bottom
  panel). The mean ± SEM percentage of PKCδ or CTB cells co-labeled for both PKCδ
  and CTB as a function of the rostral-caudal level is shown on the right (n=2 mice,
  8 slices per mouse). (C) Schematics for the optogenetically assisted circuit mapping
  experiments. VGAT-cre::Ai9 and C57BL/6 J mice were stereotaxically injected with
  AAV-hsyn-hChR2-EYFP into the CeA. Lower left panel – perisomatic ChR2-EYFP (green)
  in VGAT-positive CeA neurons (red) are highlighted by white arrows. Lower right
  panel – CeA terminals (green; white arrows) in proximity to VGAT-positive ZI neurons
  (red; blue arrows). Scale bars are 20 µm. (D) Schematic diagram and differential
  contrast image of the ZI for ex-vivo whole-cell recordings in acute ZI brain slices
  is shown in the left panel. Scale bar is 500 µm. Top right panel - Representative
  traces showing responses of VGAT-positive (cyan) and VGAT-negative (blue) ZI neurons
  upon optical paired pulse stimulation of ChR2-expressing CeA terminals (0.5–10ms
  duration, 200ms inter-stimulus interval). Ten overlaid responses are shown in black
  and the averaged response in cyan or blue. Blue bars under the traces represent
  the timing and duration of blue light stimulation. The mean ± SEM paired pulse ratio
  is shown on the bottom right panel (n=8 VGAT-negative and 12 VGAT-positive cells).
  (E) Representative traces of optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs)
  of ZI neurons before and 3 min after bath exchange to ACSF containing 10 μM Bicuculline
  (Bic). The mean ± SEM of the oIPSC amplitude is shown on the right panel (n=7 cells
  collected from 7 mice; paired two-tailed t-test: t=3.361, df = 6, *p=0.0152 for
  ACSF vs Bicuculline). (F) Representative traces of light-evoked responses recorded
  at 0 mV and –70 mV. The mean ± SEM response amplitude is shown on the right panel
  (n=10 cells collected from 7 mice; paired two-tailed t-test: t=5.879, df = 9, ***p=0.0002
  for 0 mV vs –70 mV). See . Figure 2—source data 1.Source data for anatomical and
  electrophysiological validation of CeA-PKCd to ZI pathway.'
