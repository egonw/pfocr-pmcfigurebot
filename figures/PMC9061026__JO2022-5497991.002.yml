caption: 'Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and validation of LA targets.
  (a) The bubble size represents the number of genes enriched in this pathway, the
  bubble color difference represents the level of gene enrichment, and the circle
  size represents the number of targets in the pathway. The redder the color, the
  smaller the p value. (b) A 2D diagram of the interaction between LA and VEGFR-2
  (PBD: 4AGD). Dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds, and eyelashes indicate hydrophobicity.
  (c) A 3D diagram of the interaction between LA and VEGFR-2 (PBD: 4AGD). The LA structure
  is shown in green. The amino acids associated with the A-chain binding pocket of
  4AGD are indicated in purple. The amino acids associated with the B-chain binding
  pocket of 4AGD are indicated in indigo. Yellow dashed lines indicate the length
  of the hydrogen bonds. (d) Stability analysis of modeled proteins using the Desmond
  module (Schrodinger suite) for VEGFR-2 and LA protein interactions. (e) Histogram
  and percentage of interaction in molecular dynamics simulation of VEGFR-2-LA. (f)
  Simulation interaction diagram showing interactions of LA with crucial amino acids
  of the VEGFR-2 protein. (g) Results of microscale thermophoresis for LA vs. VEGFR-2.
  (h) Enzyme inhibitory activity of VEGFR-2.'
