caption: C-PC attenuates MSC senescence by interfering with ZDHHC5-mediated autophagy.
  (A) GO enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched
  in several biological processes. (B) Representative proteome chip results. Protein-protein
  interaction was detected (blue boxes) between C-PC and ZDHHC5 by red fluorescence.
  Representative images of protein chip showed positive control (red arrow), negative
  control (blue arrow) and ZDHHC5 spot (yellow arrow) on the enlarged images. (C)
  Pull down assay and the quantification analysis to show the interactions of α and
  β subunits of C-PC with ZDHHC5. (D) Western blot was performed to detect the protein
  levels of ZDHHC5 in different groups and the corresponding quantification analysis.
  β-actin was used as the internal control. (E) Representative images of β-Galactosidase
  staining and the quantification analysis of the percentage of senescence MSCs. Scale
  bars, 50 μm. (F) SOD activity assay of MSCs in different groups. (G)The protein
  levels of senescence, autophagy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway related proteins
  detected by Western blot and the corresponding quantification analysis. Protein
  levels were normalized to GAPDH. (H) Representative images of the observed autophagosomes
  by transmission electron microscope. One red arrow pointed to autophagosomes while
  two arrows pointed to autolysosome. Scale bars were shown in Figure. (I) Western
  blot analysis of the protein levels involved in autophagy and mTOR signaling after
  autophagy block by Baf-A1 (200 nM, 6 h) in MSCs. The quantification analysis of
  western blot was calculated by Image-J. Protein levels were normalized to GAPDH.
  Results were expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). The P values were determined by
  Kruskal-Wallis test.
