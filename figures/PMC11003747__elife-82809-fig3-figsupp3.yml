figure_title: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) total proteome canonical pathway analysis
caption: (A) IPA canonical pathway analysis of total proteome data from I-ASD showing
  top 10 enriched pathways. Total proteome does not show enrichment of mTOR pathway
  or mTOR pathway members. (B) IPA canonical pathway analysis of total proteome data
  from 16pDel showing top 10 enriched pathways. Total proteome does not show enrichment
  of mTOR pathway or mTOR pathway members.
