caption: Detection of autophagy by MDC staining in breast cancer cells. MCF-7 and
  MDA-MB-231 cells were pre-treated with or without 3-MA (1 mM) for 4 h, followed
  by UA/EPI incubation for another 24 h, and then incubated with 0.05 mM monodansylcadaverine
  (MDC) for 1 h. The morphological changes were then examined by fluorescence microscopy.
  Scale bar = 5 Î¼m. Autophagic vacuoles distributed within the cytoplasm or perinuclear
  regions stained by MDC appear as distinct dot-like structures.
