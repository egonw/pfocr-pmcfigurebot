caption: 'Cornuside activated the AKT/Nrf2 pathway and inhibited NF-κB signaling in
  3 × Tg-AD mice. (a) Typical WB outcomes and (b–e) quantitative assessments of hippocampal
  and cortical p-AKT, nuclear Nrf2, IκB-α, and p-NF-κB p65 proteins for the 3 × Tg-AD
  mice in the presence or absence of cornuside compared with WT mice. GAPDH or Histone-H3
  was used as the control. Data are all expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 6 in each group).
  # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared with WT + Veh mice; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01
  compared with 3 × Tg-AD + Veh group.'
