caption: Systems biology analysis of quantified proteins in hCOX-2 Tg mice. (A) Representative
  image of the enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. All enzymes quantified
  in this pathway were downregulated (red color), except for HK1, which was increased
  (green color). Gray color indicates enzymes that were not quantified. (B) Cumulative
  distributions of the standardized variable at the protein level (i.e., corrected
  log2 ratios of proteins expressed in units of standard deviations), for proteins
  belonging to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and calcium signaling. The black sigmoid
  is the theoretical null hypothesis distribution; a displacement toward the left
  indicates an increase in protein concentration in hCOX2 Tg mice. (C) Calcium signaling
  proteins quantified in hCOX-2 Tg mice.
