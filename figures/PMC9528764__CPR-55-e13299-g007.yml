caption: M2 microphage polarization and TGF‐β1 signaling pathway after P144 treatment.
  (A) CD206 positive macrophages in the kidney of uIRIx mice treated with P144 detected
  by immunofluorescence staining. (B) Expression of α‐SMA in CD206 positive macrophages
  in the kidney of uIRIx mice treated with P144 detected by immunofluorescence staining.
  The white arrows indicate the α‐SMA+ CD206+ macrophages. (C, D) Immunohistochemical
  staining of CD206 in the kidney of uIRIx mice treated with P144. (E–G) Expression
  of CD206, p‐Smad3, and Smad3 in the kidney of uIRIx mice treated with P144 detected
  by western blotting. Data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3–6. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Scale bar = 50 μm. TGF‐β1, transforming growth factor‐β;
  uIRIx, unilateral ischemia–reperfusion injury and contralateral nephrectomy
article_title: TGF‐β1 peptide‐based inhibitor P144 ameliorates renal fibrosis after
  ischemia–reperfusion injury by modulating alternatively activated macrophages.
