caption: RV treatment reduces the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in UVECs. (A and
  B) Effects of RV treatment on (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression levels of total
  and phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, and mTOR in UVECs compared with the control. (C
  and D) Effects of PI3KIR on (C) mRNA and (D) protein expression levels of total
  and phosphorylated AKT and mTOR in UVECs compared with the control. (E and F) Effects
  of PI3KOR on the (E) mRNA and (F) protein expression levels of total and phosphorylated
  AKT and PI3K, and mTOR in UVECs compared with the control. (G and H) Effects of
  PI3KOR on RV-regulated (G) mRNA and (H) protein expression levels of total and phosphorylated
  AKT, and mTOR in UVECs compared with the control. **P<0.01. UVECs, umbilical vein
  endothelial cells; PI3KIR, PI3K inhibitor; PI3KOR, PI3K overexpression; RV, resveratrol;
  p, phosphorylated.
