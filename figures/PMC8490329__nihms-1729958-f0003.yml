caption: Percent change in oxylipin concentrations associated with a simultaneous
  quartile increase of a class-specific mixture of phenol, phthalate, or organophosphate
  ester (OPE) biomarkers among pregnant women (n = 89).,1 Percent change and 95% confidence
  intervals (CI) of oxylipin concentrations were generated by quantile g-computation
  models fit separately for each chemical class mixture. Models were adjusted for
  gestational age at sampling and maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI,
  education, and delivery year. Bootstrapped estimates account for sampling weights
  and longitudinal clustering within participant. Corresponding numerical estimates
  and weights of individual chemicals are provided in -.2 Oxylipins are grouped by
  biosynthetic pathway, including fatty acid precursor (i.e., linoleic acid [LA],
  arachidonic acid [AA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA])
  and enzyme group (i.e., cytochrome P450 [CYP], lipoxygenase [LOX], and cyclooxygenase
  [COX]) . DEHP represents âˆ‘DEHP from corresponding metabolites.
