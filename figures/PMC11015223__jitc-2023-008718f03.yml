caption: OMA1 promotes mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin signaling. (A) The results of WB
  experiments showed that oeOMA1 promoted the expression of PINK1, p-Parkinser65,
  LC-3, BNIP3, and BNIP3L. (B, C) The autophagosomes are labeled by LC3 (green fluorescence)
  protein, and the mitochondria are labeled by TOM20 (red fluorescence) protein. The
  number of colocalized LC3 and TOM20 was quantified. Scale bar, 50 µm. (D) WB of
  PINK1, Parkin, p-Parkinser65, and LC3 in GBM primary cells treated with the indicated
  concentrations of OMA1 for 24 hours. (E) WB of Parkin in the cytosolic and mitochondrial
  fractions of GBM primary cells treated with or without oeOMA1 for 24 hours. β-Actin
  (cytoplasmic fraction) and VDAC1 (mitochondrial fraction) were used as the loading
  controls. (F) Colocalization of PINK1 (green fluorescence) protein and Parkin (red
  fluorescence) protein in GBM primary cells following oeOMA treatment or not. The
  number of colocalized PINK1 and Parkin was quantified. Scale bar, 50 µm. The means±SDs
  are provided (n=3). **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001 according to two-tailed Student’s t-tests
  or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett tests for multiple comparisons. ANOVA, analysis
  of variance; GBM, glioblastoma; NS, not statistically significant; oeOMA1, overexpression
  of OMA1; WB, Western blotting.

  the cGAS–STING pathway to mediate GBM immune escape.
