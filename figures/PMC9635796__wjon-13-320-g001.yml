caption: Anlotinib changes the TME and broadens the benefits of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
  in patients with advanced NSCLC. (a) The objective tumor response of patients in
  anlotinib, PD-1 mAb and A+P combination groups. (b) The PFS and OS curves of overall
  patients. (c) The PFS and OS curves of patients in anlotinib, PD-1 mAb and A+P combination
  groups. (d) Scatter-plot of anlotinib-responsive gene differential screening. (e)
  Heatmap of the differential expressions of 1,273 DEGs after anlotinib treatments.
  (f) Coefficients of LASSO regression analysis. (g) The cross-validation results
  of LASSO regression and coefficients of selected genes. (h) Kaplan-Meier analysis
  demonstrated that the PFS of patients who received PD-1 mAb in the high-risk group
  were significantly shorter than those of the low-risk group. (i) The ORR of patients
  in high- and low-risk groups. (j) Box-plot of the ARIM-scores for different anti-tumor
  treatment responses. (k) The OS of patients who received PD-1 mAb in the high- and
  low-risk groups. (l, m) Time-dependent ROC curves for recurrence and mortality of
  patients who received PD-1 mAb at different follow-up times. (n) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the 1273 DEGs. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
