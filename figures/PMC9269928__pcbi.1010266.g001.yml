figure_title: Quantification of bursts in TGF-β-induced SMAD translocation
caption: 'A: Scheme of microscopy-based single-cell analysis of TGF-β signaling. In
  unstimulated cells the SMAD2-GFP fusion protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm
  (top). TGF-β stimulation promotes the transport of SMAD2-GFP to the nucleus and
  hence increases the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio that was quantified from microscopy images
  (bottom). See [] for details on the data analysis. B: Bursts in SMAD2 nuclear translocation.
  Time-resolved measurements of the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio of four individual cells (colored
  lines) are compared to the population average response over 352 cells (black line)
  upon stimulation with 100 pM TGF-β. A stochastic deflection (burst) is highlighted
  (arrow, dotted lines indicate beginning and end). C: Burst detection process. Bursts
  are detected in the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio of a single-cell upon stimulation with TGF-β.
  Top: Peaks in the measured trajectory of the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio (black line) are
  approximated by a sum of Gaussian hills (green lines) which are subtracted from
  a smoothened version of the signal to estimate the long-term trend (blue line).
  Bottom: Afterwards, the long term trend is subtracted from the measurement data
  (black line), short-term effects are smoothed out by a Gaussian filter (blue line)
  and the result is analyzed by a peak finding algorithm which detects 5 bursts in
  this example (indicated in red). As pathway events might occur shortly after each
  other we allowed for overlapping bursts. The bursts are characterized by their height
  and duration (red dashed lines). See  for details. D: Burst height increases with
  TGF-β dose. Violin plots show the distributions of the burst height for the first
  5 bursts (burst index) in the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio trajectories upon stimulation
  with 5 pM (blue) and 25 pM (red) TGF-β and in a control population (0 pM). Median
  and mean are marked by red and black horizontal lines. E: Burst count increases
  with TGF-β dose. Distribution of burst counts in the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio trajectories
  after stimulation with 5 pM and 25 pM TGF-β and in a control population (0 pM).
  Higher doses of TGF-β lead to higher burst counts. Median and mean are marked by
  red and black horizontal lines. F: Burst duration is independent of TGF-β dose.
  Violin plots show the distributions of burst duration for the first 5 bursts (burst
  index) in the nuc/cyt SMAD ratio trajectories upon stimulation with 5 pM and 25
  pM TGF-β and in a control population (0 pM). Median and mean are marked by red and
  black horizontal lines. G: Bursts count correlates to cell motility at the single-cell
  level. Single cells were binned according to their area-under-curve (AUC), measured
  as the integral of the nuc/cyt SMAD2 ratio over all time points (x-axis), and were
  further sub-classified in terms of their total burst count (see legend). The cell
  motility (y-axis) was calculated by taking the sum over the distance moved by the
  cells in consecutive time points. Among cells with similar total signal (AUC), cells
  with 8 or less bursts (blue) exhibit lower motility than cells with 12 or more bursts
  (red).'
