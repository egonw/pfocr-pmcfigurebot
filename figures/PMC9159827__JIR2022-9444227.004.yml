caption: 'Inhibition of the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway suppressed ovalbumin-induced
  Th17 cell response. (a, b) Splenocytes were derived from mice and stimulated with
  PMA and ionomycin, and after fixed and permeabilized, cells were incubated with
  extracellular and intracellular antibodies. Stained cells were run on the CytoFLEX
  Flow Analyzer and analyzed with the CytExpert software. (c) The concentration of
  IL-17A in BALF was quantified by ELISA. (d) mRNA expression of RORγt in lung homogenates
  was detected by real-time PCR. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 6. Compared
  to the control group, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001; compared to the neutrophilic
  asthma group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001. NLRP3: nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3; PMA: phorbol
  12-myristate 13-acetate; BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; ELISA: enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay; RORγt: retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt; PCR: polymerase
  chain reaction.'
