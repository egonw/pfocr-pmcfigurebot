caption: The regulation of oxidative stress pathway of H2O2-induced PC12 cells with
  treatment. (a) Western blotting in H2O2-induced PC12 cells with treatment; (b) the
  expression of PI3K in H2O2-induced PC12 cells with treatment; (c) the expression
  of AKT in H2O2-induced PC12 cells with treatment; (d) the expression of P-AKT in
  H2O2-induced PC12 cells with treatment; (f) the expression of GSK-3β in H2O2-induced
  PC12 cells with treatment. Compared with the control group, the difference was significant
  (#P < 0.05); Compared with the model group, the difference was significant (∗P <
  0.05).
