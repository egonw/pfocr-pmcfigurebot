caption: Deoxyschizandrin inhibits the migration, invasion, and in vitro tumorigenesis
  of bladder cancer cell lines. (a and b) Wound healing showed that Deoxyschizandrin
  significantly suppressed migration in HT1376 cells. (c and d) Wound healing showed
  that Deoxyschizandrin significantly suppressed migration in J82 cells. (e and f)
  Transwell assays showed that Deoxyschizandrin significantly suppressed invasion
  in HT1376 cells. (g and h) Transwell assays showed that Deoxyschizandrin significantly
  suppressed invasion in J82 cells. (i and j) The expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin
  protein level with Deoxyschizandrin treatment in HT1376 and J82 cells. (k and l)
  BALB/c nude mice injected into HT1376 and J82 cells had smaller volume tumor xenografts
  with Deoxyschizandrin treat. Data represent mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 compared with negative
  control.
