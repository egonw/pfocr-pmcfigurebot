figure_title: HOXB9 regulates the expression of TGFβ1 signature, angiogenic factors,
  and EMT markers
caption: PDAC cell lines, Panc1 and MiaPaCa2, showed high HOXB9 mRNA expression relative
  to the human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A (A). siRNAs substantially reduced
  HOXB9 expression in PDAC cells by approximately 80% (B). HOXB9 expression by these
  siRNAs also correlated to the reduction in the expression of several TGFβ1 signatures
  (C) and angiogenic factors (D). In addition, reduction in HOXB9 expression in the
  two PDAC cell lines also mitigated EMT (E). Moreover, the angiogenic factors reduced
  upon HOXB9 depletion were amplified by incubation with the TGFβ1 recombinant construct
  (F).
