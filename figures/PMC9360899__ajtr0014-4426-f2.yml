caption: OrA is a Chinese herbal extract that can have an anticancer effect by upregulating
  PTEN and decreasing AKT. In in vivo experiments using a rat model of GBC compared
  two groups, one injected with saline and one injected with OrA. The results suggested
  that the OrA treatment group showed suppressed tumor growth compared with the control
  group. In vitro, OrA inhibits cellular proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and inhibits
  cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, OrA treatment increases the expression
  levels of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in a dose-dependent manner to cause apoptosis
  by promoting mitochondrial apoptosis.
