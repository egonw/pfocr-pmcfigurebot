figure_title: Effect of the scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro
caption: (A) SEM and CLSM observations and (B) the corresponding quantitative assay
  of the cell area and (C) cell number of BMSCs cultured on the scaffolds for 1 day
  (actin filament is stained red, while the cell nuclei are stained blue). (D) Cell
  viability of BMSCs cultured on the scaffolds at days 1, 3, and 5, and several osteogenic
  gene expressions of BMSCs cultured on the scaffolds at days 3 and 5 (error bars,
  means ± SD; n = 6 per group for cell viability test; n = 3 per group for qRT-PCR
  analysis). All analyses were done using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
  *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001.
