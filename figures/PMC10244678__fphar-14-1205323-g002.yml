caption: BDX-01 is non-pathogenic to Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells and C57BL/6J mice. (A,B)
  BDX-01 cytotoxicity to Caco-2 (A) and IEC-6 (B) cells at 100:1 and 200:1 infection
  ratios for 4 h. The culture medium was the negative control (n = 5). (C) Changes
  in the BW (%)/d in the treatment and control groups. SPF C57BL/6J normal mice (n
  = 8) were treated with 5 × 1011 CFU/d BDX-01 for 5 days and observed for 14 days.
  The Control group was treated with PBS. (D) Photomicrographs of stomachs, colons,
  livers, and spleens of mice in the control (upper) and treatment (lower) groups.
  No significant lesions were observed.
