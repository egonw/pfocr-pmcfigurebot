caption: 'SlHSP17.7 promotes starch formation under normal conditions. (A) Determination
  of soluble sugar content. (B) Determination of starch content. For (A,B), Error
  bars represent the SD with three biological replicates (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).
  (C) Pathway diagram of starch synthesis and decomposition. FPKM values are used
  in the heat maps (MM-0 h vs. OE-0 h). Red color represents upregulated gene, while
  orange represents downregulated gene. Abbreviations: Suc, sucrose; Sus, sucrose
  synthase; INV, invertase; Fru, fructose; Glc, glucose; UDPG, uridine-diphosphoglucose;
  HXK, hexokinase; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G1P, glucose-1-phosphate;
  TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; T6P, trehalose-6-phosphate; AGPase, ADP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; ADP-G, ADP-glucose. Arrows (â†’) signify the direction or stimulation
  of the reaction.'
