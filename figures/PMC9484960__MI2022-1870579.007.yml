caption: 'LMX1B depletion suppressed IL-1β-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 activation. Western
  blot was used to determine the protein expression of p-P65, P65 (a), and NLRP3 (b).
  SW1353 cells were transfected with control siRNA or LMX1B siRNA for 24 h by using
  Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and then treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h, or SW1353
  cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β and PDTC for 24 h. ∗P < 0.05, compared with
  the control group; #P < 0.05, compared with the IL-1β group. All experiments were
  repeated three times.'
