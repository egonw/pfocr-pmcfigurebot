caption: 'PAM treatment inhibited PC-9 cell migration through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) Transwell migrated images from the control group, the PAM (30 s) treatment
  group, the IWP-2 alone treatment group, and the IWP-2 pretreatment group. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of cell migration. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  “ns” means no statistical difference. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 with ANOVA compared
  with the control. ## p < 0.01.'
