caption: 'Verification of CXCR1-NF-κB-COX-2/ICAM-1/VCAM-1 pathway regulated by GXNI.
  (A) RT-PCR verification results of GXNI regulated genes in CXCR1-NF-κB-COX-2/ICAM-1/VCAM-1
  pathway, including Cxcr1, Cxcr2, Traf6, Mapk10, Rhov and Cox2. (B) Representative
  blots of CXCR1, NF-κB, COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the sham, I/R, and GXNI (9 mL/kg)
  groups. (C) Quantification of expression levels of CXCR1, NF-κB, COX-2, ICAM-1 and
  VCAM-1 proteins. (D) Representative pictures of immunohistochemistry staining. (E)
  Quantification of CXCR1 expression levels in cardiac tissue sections. Values were
  expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5). #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. sham group,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. I/R group.'
