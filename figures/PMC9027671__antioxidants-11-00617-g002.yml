caption: 'Signaling pathway underlying impaired Nrf2 function and effectors of excessive
  ROS in Müller cells in diabetes: (A) Nrf2 activity and (B) Binding to xCT ARE region,
  are decreased (↓) after 1 and 6 months of diabetes. (C) GSH is reduced in the retina
  of diabetic rats in early (1 month) and late periods (6 months). Modified from [].
  Copyright 2018 Elsevier. (D) Hyperglycemia induces an increase in REDD1 expression
  in Müller cells, which activates GSK. Once activated, GSK impairs Nrf2 function.
  As a result, there is a decrease in GSH levels and antioxidant defense capacity,
  resulting in higher oxidative stress in Müller glia. Direct effect of excessive
  ROS in Müller cells is indicated by brown arrows: increase (↑) in oxidative DNA
  damage/mitophagy, VEGF, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), and unfolded protein
  response (UPR)/autophagy. All these responses intensify the production of ROS (gray
  arrows) enhancing oxidative stress in Müller cells. * p < 0.05 in comparison to
  normal.'
