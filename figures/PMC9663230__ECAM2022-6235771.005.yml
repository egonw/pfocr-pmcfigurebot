caption: 'FRS2 knockdown regulates EC cell proliferation, invasion and migration (a)
  Expression of FRS2 in FRS2-knockdown Ishikawa cells was assessed by Q-PCR (n = 6).
  (b) Expression of FRS2 in FRS2-knockdown Ishikawa cells was assessed by Western
  blot analysis (n = 6). (c) The proliferation of Ishikawa cells at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
  5 and 6 days following FRS2 knockdown (n = 6). ((d), (e)) FRS2 knockdown inhibits
  the G1/S transition of EC cells (n = 6). ((f), (g)) Cell apoptosis was detected
  in FRS2-knockdown EC cells using flow cytometry analysis (n = 6). ((h), (i)) Transwell
  invasion assays were performed in FRS2-knockdown EC cells (n = 6). all data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. statistical significance: ∗∗, P < 0.01 compared with
  the shNC group.'
