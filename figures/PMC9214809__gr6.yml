caption: Effect of seladelpar on Cyp7a1 expression in Fgf21 deficient hepatocytes.A–C,
  primary mouse hepatocytes isolated from WT or Fgf21-/- were treated with seladelpar
  (0.1–10 μM). E, Wy14643 (10 μΜ) or F, GW4064 (10 μΜ) for 48 h. D, littermate WT
  and Fgf21-/- were gavaged with PBS or seladelpar (10 mg/kg body weight) and harvested
  after 6 h. Hepatic expression of Cyp7a1 was examined. qPCR data are presented as
  mean ± S.E.M. of at least three independent replicates. Two technical replicates
  were performed for mouse experiments. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 denote the significant
  difference between control and treatment in each condition.
