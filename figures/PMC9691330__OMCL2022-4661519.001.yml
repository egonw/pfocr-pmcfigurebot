caption: 'BHF177 confers protection against DNP by regulating GABAB receptor. (a)
  The expression heat map of the 250 genes with the most significantly low expression
  in the microarray GSE27382. (b) The intersection of 250 lowest-expressed genes from
  the microarray GSE27382 and diabetic neuralgia-related genes predicted by GeneCards,
  showing 19 intersection genes. (c) The expression box plot of GABBR1 in the microarray
  GSE27382; the blue box indicates the expression of normal samples, and the red box
  indicates the expression of diabetic samples. (d) The PWT and PWL of DNP rats treated
  with BHF177 and/or CGP46381. (e) The plasma glucose level of DNP rats treated with
  BHF177 and/or CGP46381. n = 10. âˆ—p < 0.05 vs. normal rats, #p < 0.05 vs. rat models
  of DNP, and &p < 0.05 vs. DNP rats treated with BHF177. Animal, n = 10.'
