caption: 'Amentoflavone decreases HMGA2 via miR-16. (A) qPCR validation of 22 predicted
  miR-16 target gene expressions in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone
  (5 µm) or vehicle. (B) The putative miR-16-binding sites on the HMGA2 3''UTR and
  the mutated HMGA2 3''UTR sites generated by site-directed mutagenesis. (C) The luciferase
  activity of HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with inhibitor-NC or miR-16 inhibitor.
  (D,E) qPCR and WB validation of HMGA2 mRNA (C) and protein (D) expression in HCT116
  and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with
  inhibitor-NC or miR-16 inhibitor. (A,C,D) N=3, mean ± SEM, #P>0.05; *P<0.05, by
  Student’s t-test. Data represents similar results from 3 independent experiments.
  qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; NC, negative control; WB, western
  blotting; SEM, structural equation modeling.'
