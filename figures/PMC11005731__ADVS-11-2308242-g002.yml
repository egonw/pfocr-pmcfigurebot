caption: Bulk and spatial RNA‐sequencing to study the HCC treatment effects of BCG.
  A) GSEA of transcriptomic data of the healthy livers, untreated HCC, and BCG‐treated
  HCC. The top pathways enriched due to HCC development (left) and BCG treated (right)
  are listed. Those changes have a significance level of p < 0.05 and an FDR q‐value
  <0.05. B) Enrichment plot from GSEA for IFN‐γ response and HNF4α targets pathways
  after BCG treatment. C) Comparison of mRNA levels of genes implicated in the IFN‐γ
  response pathway (p < 0.05). D,E) GSEA analysis based on the spatial RNA sequencing
  data. Pathways and differentially expressed genes within the tumors/margins of BCG‐treated
  versus untreated HCC are shown in D and E, respectively.
