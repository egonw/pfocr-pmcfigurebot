caption: The models were successfully established, and the m6A methyltransferase METTL3
  was identified in murine fungal keratitis. (A) Slit-lamp observation of the corneas
  at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection. (B) Clinical scores showing that inflammation
  peaked on day 5. (C) The m6A content in total RNAs in both groups. (D) METTL3 expression
  was noticeably increased in mouse fungal keratitis, as shown by RT–PCR analysis.
  (E, F) METTL3 protein levels were assessed via Western blotting. (G) Immunofluorescence
  was performed to determine METTL3 levels; n = 6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  The scale bar indicates 70 µm.
