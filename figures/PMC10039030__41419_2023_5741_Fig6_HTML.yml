figure_title: GPAT3 promotes inflammation response through the LPA-mediated PKCθ,
  ERK1/2 and c-Jun pathway
caption: A Mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1) in KCs treated with 30 μM LPA for
  12 h (n = 3). B Western blot images and quantification of PKCθ, P-ERK1/2 and P-c-Jun
  protein expression in KCs treated with LPA (30 μM 12 h) (n = 3). C Western blot
  images and quantification of GPAT3, PKCθ, P-ERK1/2 and P-c-Jun protein expression
  in LPS-stimulated KCs transfected with GPAT3 siRNA (n = 3). D Western blot images
  and quantification of inflammatory cytokines and ERK1/2 pathway expression in control
  or LPA treatment KCs and pretreatment U0126 (10 μM 2 h, ERK inhibitor) (n = 3).
  Data represents mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
