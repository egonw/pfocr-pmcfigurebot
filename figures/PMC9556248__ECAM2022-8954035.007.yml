caption: Biological functions and pathways of myocardial infarction targets of salvianolic
  acid A. (a) The first ten biological processes (BPs), cellular components (CCs),
  and molecular functions (MFs) of myocardial infarction targets of salvianolic acid
  A BPs, CCs, and MFs are marked by unique colors. The length of the column is proportional
  to the enrichment score (b) The first twenty Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathways of myocardial infarction targets of salvianolic acid (A) The size
  of the bubble is proportional to the count of myocardial infarction targets of salvianolic
  acid A enriched. The closer the color is to red, the smaller the adjusted p-value.
  (c) The map of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
