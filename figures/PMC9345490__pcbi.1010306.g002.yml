caption: (a) the initial (left) and final (right) patterns starting from randomized
  initial conditions. The blue heatmap quantifies the cellular levels of Delta. (b)
  Same as (a) for a “nucleating” initial condition. (c) The percent of correct contacts
  as a function of time for the randomized initial conditions (blue) and the nucleating
  initial condition (orange) corresponding to panels (a) and(b). The lattice with
  randomized initial condition leads to a frustrated pattern. (d) The average percent
  of correct contacts as a function of percentage of mistakes in the initial checkerboard
  pattern. (e) The average percent of correct contacts as a function of B, the amplitude
  of the lattice perturbation normalized by 103 (the magnitude of Notch and Delta
  copy numbers). For panels (d)-(e), percentages of correct contacts are calculated
  upon full equilibration and averaged over 20 independent simulations. The checkerboard
  pattern is robust for up to a quarter of mistakes in the lattice or a perturbation
  of magnitude 103 molecules, comparable to the Notch and Delta copy numbers.
