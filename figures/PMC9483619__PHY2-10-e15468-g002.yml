caption: Immunohistochemical staining for kidney injury marker 1 (KIM‐1). (a) Ten
  non‐overlapping fields for tubular and 10 non‐overlapping fields of renal corpuscle
  sections from each kidney were imaged at 60× magnification and analyzed in a blinded
  manner. Relative optical density (ODs) values were quantified (n = 3 mice/group)
  and analyzed using Image J analysis Software. The OD data were analyzed by two‐way
  ANOVA. (b) Immunofluorescence counterstaining of KIM‐1 (red) and meprin β (green)
  in wild‐type (WT) and villin (green) in meprin β knockout (βKO) kidneys to determine
  KIM‐1 protein localization as an indicator of kidney injury. DAPI (blue) was used
  to stain the nuclei. There were significant increases in KIM‐1 in select proximal
  tubules at 24 h post‐IR in both genotypes (p < 0.0001), confirming kidney injury.
