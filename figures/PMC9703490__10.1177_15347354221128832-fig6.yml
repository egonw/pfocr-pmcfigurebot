caption: In vitro cell migration of 3 different cells A549, HeLa, and U2OS cells after
  24 hours of treatment of EELDP (0-0.6 mg/ml). Each bar shows the mean with the standard
  deviation of the percentage of cell migration at different doses of EELDP obtained
  from 3 independent experiments. Here “**” defines 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01 and “***” defines
  P ≤ 0.001.
