caption: Functional enrichment-based clustering. (A) The biological process enrichment-based
  clustering showed elevated aerobic respiration, cellular respiration, and cellular
  amine metabolic process. (B) Cellular component enrichment-based clustering illustrated
  upregulated mitochondrial respiratory chain, respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane,
  mitochondrial matrix, and so forth. (C) Molecular function enrichment-based clustering
  demonstrated increased NADH dehydrogenase activity, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)
  activity, etc. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment-based clustering proved the upregulated
  pathways including TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation.
  Green arrows point to the upregulated aerobic respiration, mitochondrial respiratory
  chain, NADH dehydrogenase activity, amino acid/fatty acid degradation, and TCA cycle.
