caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of differential gene expression between the A. baumannii
  ATCC19606 wild-type and DJ41_1408 mutant strains. (A) Differential gene expression
  by gene ontology classification, in which only clusters with more than 2 genes are
  displayed. (B) Differential gene expression by KEGG classification, in which only
  clusters with more than 2 genes are displayed. (C) Fold-change in gene expression
  for DJ41_332-DJ41_340 and DJ41_2252-DJ41_2255, gene clusters involved in benzoate
  degradation. Black lines indicate individual transcriptional units, and white or
  grey arrows represent transcription direction. (D) DJ41_332-DJ41_340 and DJ41_2252-DJ41_2255
  annotation in the A. baumannii ATCC19606 benzoate degradation pathway. Black text:
  gene number; red text: gene name; blue text: log2 expression ratio (wild-type/âˆ†DJ41_1408).'
