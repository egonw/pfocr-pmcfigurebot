caption: GCDA regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway by promoting S1PR2 expression.
  A heat map of differential expression between low- and high- S1PR2 expression groups;
  B volcano plot revealing differential expression between low- and high- S1PR2 expression
  groups; C functional enrichment results of genes with differential expression between
  low- and high- S1PR2 expression groups. Dâ€“F The levels of protein of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway in HCC cells with knocked-down and overexpressed S1PR2 in the presence or
  absence of GCDA conditions detected by western blot
article_title: Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 promotes the onset and progression
  of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma through the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
