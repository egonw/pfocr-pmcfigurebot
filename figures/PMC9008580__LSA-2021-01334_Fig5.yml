figure_title: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activation upon low glucose counterbalances
  the loss of surface epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression
caption: (A) Cellular surface proteome analysis of human bronchial epithelial cells
  (HBECs) cultured for 48 h in 10 or 0.1 mM glucose (Glc), with and without GlcNAc
  supplementation. Shown are proteins manually curated for being localized on the
  cell membrane and whose expression was down-regulated in the 0.1 mM glucose condition
  and restored or not by GlcNAc supplementation. (A, B) Representative FACS analysis
  of EGFR surface expression in HBECs grown as in (A). (C) Representative Western
  blotting of EGFR in HBECs grown for 48 h in 10 or 0.1 mM glucose conditions and
  treated or not with tunicamycin (Tm) for the last 24 h of culture. Tubulin is used
  as a loading control. (C, D) Representative FACS analysis of EGFR surface expression
  in HBECs grown and treated as in (C).Source data are available for this figure.
