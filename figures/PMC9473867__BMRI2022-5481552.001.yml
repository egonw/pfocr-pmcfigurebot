caption: 'Hirudin''s inhibition towards the EMT indicators of NRK-52E. (a) The cell
  migration conditions of the control, model, and hirudin group are revealed by transwell
  assay. Scale bar: 100 μm. (b) The western blot assay on the protein expressions
  of fibronectin, N-cadherin, vimentin, TGF-β, and snail and (c) the corresponding
  gray statistics parameters. (d) The qPCR detection on the expressions of fibronectin,
  N-cadherin, vimentin, TGF-β, and snail. ##P < 0.01, compared with the model.'
