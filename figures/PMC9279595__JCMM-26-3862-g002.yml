caption: 'Morphological features and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of thoracic
  ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) in different ossification stages. (A)
  micro‐CT images of different ossification stages of TOLF. Initial ossification (IO)
  of TOLF; immature ossification (IMO) of TOLF; mature ossification (MO) of TOLF.
  The scale bar represents 5 mm; (B) quantitative results of TOLF morphology; * p < 0.05
  compared with IO group, # p < 0.05 compared with IMO group; (C) Strategy for the
  identification of DEGs; (D) Heat map of the hierarchical clustering of the different
  ossification stages of the DEGs'

  flavum cells by Wnt signalling pathway.
