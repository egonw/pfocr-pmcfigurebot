caption: 'Directed evolution of TAL as an example to evaluate potential epistasis
  of the heterologous naringenin biosynthetic pathway a) Naringenin biosynthesis pathway:
  Tyrosine is transformed to naringenin by four enzymes: tyrosine ammonia‐lyase (TAL),
  4‐coumarate‐CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI).
  b) Various constructs were tested for narinengin production, with its original status
  as all four genes were under the control of PT7 in the same pCDF plasmid and the
  dual‐plasmid system where the individual gene under the control of PBAD promoter
  was placed on plasmids with diverse copy numbers and co‐expressed with the other
  three genes on pCDF. c) Influence of different plasmid copy numbers on naringenin
  production. The TAL gene was placed in pBbS8C (SC101 replicon, 5–10 copies), pBbA8c
  (p15a replicon, 10–15 copies), pBbB8a (BBR1 replicon, 17–20 copies), pBbE5K (ColE1
  replicon, 20–30 copies) and pRSF (RSF replicon, 100 copies). The parent strain contains
  the pCDF plasmid (CDF replicon, 20 copies) with TAL, 4CL, CHS, and CHI genes. The
  highest producers are labeled with red arrows and the artificial pathway bottlenecks
  are marked with blank arrows. The gray arrows indicate the expected evolutionary
  space. Naringenin concentrations were determined by HPLC in biological triplicates
  and the error bars represent the standard deviation. d) TAL, when present in low
  copy number plasmid, was successfully evolved to produce the same amount of naringenin
  as the positive control. TAL‐26E7 is the candidate TAL mutant with the highest naringenin
  production, PC (+) strain, positive control strain containing pBbE5K‐TAL, and pCDF‐4CL‐CHS‐CHI.
  NC (‐), negative control strain containing plasmid pBbS8C‐TAL and pCDF‐4CL‐CHS‐CHI.
  e) Investigating the potential epistasis of the TAL gene. The TAL gene and its mutants
  in pBbE5K (ColE1 replicon, 20–30 copies) plasmid were transformed into competent
  cells harboring plasmid pCDF‐4CL‐CHS‐CHI (4SI) or pCDF‐4CL‐11C1‐CHS‐9H9‐CHI (4SI‐M),
  respectively. Naringenin concentrations were determined by HPLC in biological triplicates
  and the error bars represent the standard deviation.'
