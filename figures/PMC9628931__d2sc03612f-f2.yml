figure_title: 'Discovery of akuammiline biosynthetic pathway genes. (A) The methanoquinolizidine
  structure and the biosynthetic pathway of akuammiline. (B) LCMS chromatograms at
  m/z 351 (highlighted in red) and 353 showing the in vitro catalytic activity of
  AsRHS using geissoschizine as the substrate and quenched either by MeOH or NaBH4.
  (C) LCMS chromatograms at m/z 353 showing the in vitro catalytic activity of AsRHR1
  and AsRHR2 by incubation together with geissoschizine and AsRHS. (D) LCMS chromatograms
  at m/z 395 showing the in vitro catalytic activity of AKS1 and AKS2 using synthetic
  rhazimol as the substrate. Denatured enzymes were used for negative controls, the
  peak at m/z 353 with a retention time of 5.9 min corresponds to the substrate (geissoschizine).
  RHS: rhazimal synthase; RHR: rhazimal reductase; AKS: akuammiline synthase'
