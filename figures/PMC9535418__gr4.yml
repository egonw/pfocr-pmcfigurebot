caption: Establishment of pyroptosis signaturesa Alluvial plot of the changes of PRclusters,
  gene cluster, PRGscore and survival status. b Distinctions in PRGscore among three
  PRclusters and four PRG gene cluster. The Kruskal Wallis test was applied to compare
  the statistical difference between the clusters (P < 0.001). c Survival analyses
  for low and high PRGscore patient groups in OC cohort. d The abundance of each infiltrating
  cell in PRGscore groups. e Correlations between PRGscore and immune cells. f The
  box plot showed difference in TME score between PRGscore subgroups. g Enrichment
  plots indicates that immune related pathway enriched in the low PRGscore subgroup.
