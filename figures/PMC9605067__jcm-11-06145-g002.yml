caption: JAK–STAT signaling and oral/topical JAK inhibitors in atopic dermatitis.
  The JAK protein family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) mediates IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31
  cytokine signaling via cognate receptors. Activation of JAKs results in the phosphorylation
  of downstream STAT proteins, followed by their nuclear translocation and activation
  of target genes. JAK inhibitors inhibit the activity of one or more JAKs, thereby
  interfering with the JAK–STAT signaling pathway. JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; TYK2, tyrosine kinase 2; IL, interleukin.
