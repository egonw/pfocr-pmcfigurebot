caption: 'Comparison of steroid response amplitude to ACTH between UL and BL patients
  after matching on adrenal volume. Steroid amplitude of response to ACTH remains
  higher in BL patients than in UL patients even after matching on adrenal volume.
  (A) Glucocorticoids pathway. (B) Other steroids. Results are represented as median
  and interquartile range. 17OHP: 17-hydroxyprogesterone.*P <  0.05 ; **P < 0.001;
  ***P <  0.0001.'
article_title: Decreased steroidogenic enzyme activity in benign adrenocortical tumors
  is more pronounced in bilateral lesions as determined by steroid profiling in LC-MS/MS
  during ACTH stimulation test.
