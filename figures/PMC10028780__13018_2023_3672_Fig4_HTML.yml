caption: 'Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways DEPs. The ordinate is the name of the
  KEGG pathway, and the abscissa is the enrichment fold of the pathway. The number
  of differentially expressed genes is represented by the size of the bubble, and
  the P value is represented by color. The top ten pathways are: blood coagulation,
  hemostasis, coagulation, platelet degranulation, humoral immune response, neutrophil
  degranulation, platelet activation, complement activation, acute phase response
  and alternative pathway of complement activation'
