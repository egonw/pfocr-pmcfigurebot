caption: 'Hepatic Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is upregulated by TA in CP-injected mice. (A)
  Representative images of the hepatic Nrf2 immunostaining from indicated groups are
  displayed (brown represents increases of Nrf2 staining intensity in CP groups; IHC,
  X200; Scale bar, 50 µm); (B) Quantification of Nrf2 immunostaining in indicated
  groups expressed as fold change of the control group; (C) Hepatic levels of HO-1
  in indicated groups are measured by ELISA. Values are mean ± standard error of the
  mean (S.E.M.) (n ═ 6 per group). a: P < 0.05 vs control; b: P < 0.05 vs CP. Nrf2:
  Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1; TA: Taxifolin;
  CP: Cyclophosphamide; IHC: Immunohistochemistry.'
