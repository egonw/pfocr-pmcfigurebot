caption: Discovery of ovoselenol (OVS) and its biosynthetic pathway. (a) Genes ovsA
  (NHISS) and ovsM (methyltransferase) are clustered with selenosugar biosynthesis
  genes senB/C in Halomonas utahensis. The gray arrow represents a hypothetical gene
  not conserved among ovs clusters. In other strains, such as Marinobacter vinifirmus,
  the genes co-occur but are chromosomally separated. (b) Ovs genes are found predominantly
  in Marinobacter and other γ-proteobacteria species. (c) In vitro reconstitution
  of OVS biosynthesis reveals 5′-selenylation of histidine by recombinant OvsA in
  the presence of SeGlcNAc, followed by SAM-dependent Nπ-methylation by OvsM. Extracted
  ion chromatograms of mBBr-derivatives of SeGlcNAc, 5-selenohistidine (5-SeHis),
  and OVS are shown. (d, e) Mass spectra of mBBr-derivatized and underivatized 5-SeHis
  and OVS. Relevant 1H-13C HMBC NMR correlations (red arrows) used to solve the structure
  are shown. (f) Complete biosynthetic pathway of OVS. See text for details. (g) Identification
  of mBBr-derivatized OVS in crude extracts of wild type H. utahensis and M. vinifirmus.
  Genetic deletion of ovsA in the latter results in a mutant that fails to produce
  OVS, accumulating SeGlcNAc as a result. Extracted ion chromatograms of mBBr-derivatives
  of SeGlcNAc and OVS are shown, alongside mBBr derivatives of pure standards. (h)
  Co-occurrence of BGCs for ergothioneine (EGT), ovothiol (OVO), selenoneine (SEN),
  and OVS in all sequenced microbes. Sequences from undefined taxa were omitted from
  this analysis. The combinations of EGT/SEN and OVO/OVS (shown in red) are disproportionally
  overrepresented. (i) Peak oxidation potentials of OVS, and of EGT and SEN for comparison,
  measured by cyclic voltammetry. See text and  for details.
