caption: Effect of dietary agents on Notch signaling pathway in cancer cells. Notch
  ligands, including Jagged-1, bind to, and permit cleavage of, the Notch receptor.
  The Notch extracellular domain is first cleaved by ADAM-10; Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) is then cleaved by the gamma secretase complex. NICD translocates
  and activates transcription in the nucleus. Dietary agents that modulate Notch in
  cancer cells in vitro are listed. EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; DATS, diallyl
  trisulfide; RBP-JÎº, recombinant signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa
  J region; MAML, mastermind-like protein.
