caption: a Immunoblot analysis of HSP 90 in RAW264.7 cells transfected with uncorrelated
  (un) and with si-Keap1 RNA (k). RAW264.7 cells transfected with si-Keap1were treated
  with or without FA 100 μM for 1 h and then treated with LPS 100 ngr/ml for 4 h like
  the uncorrelated siRNA-transfected RAW264.7. The whole-cell lysates were obtained
  and analyzed with anti-HSP90 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Representative
  immunoblotting shows results for the protein levels of HSP 90. Histogram is representative
  of the means ± SD of three replicates after normalization with actin. Protein levels
  are reported in arbitrary units as fold increase or decrease compared to controls
  that are set to 1. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences among groups (*
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001), ****p< 0.0001. b HSP90 mRNA expression in
  uncorrelated RNA (un) and siKeap1-transfected RAW 264.7 cells (k). RAW 264.7 cells
  were treated as described above. RNA was extracted, and cDNA was analyzed by qPCR
  with hsp90 primers. Non-stimulated cells worked as a negative control. The graph
  shows the level of hsp90 mRNA expression. Results do not show significant changes
  in hsp 90 expression in siKeap1-transfected RAW 264.7 cells (k). Levels are expressed
  in arbitrary units as fold increase compared to controls assumed as 1. The data
  shown represents three independent experiments, each of which performed in triplicate;
  asterisks (*) indicate significant differences among groups (****p< 0.0001).
