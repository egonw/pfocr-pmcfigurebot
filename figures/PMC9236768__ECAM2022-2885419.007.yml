caption: Mechanism of JWYHD activation of BMP signaling pathway and promotion of BMSC
  osteogenic differentiation. JWYHD activates BMP2 to bind to its receptor, leading
  to phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, while P-SMAD1/5/8 binds to SMAD4 and is transported
  to the nucleus to jointly regulate the transcription of downstream target genes
  RUNX2 and OCN.

  Signaling Pathway to Promote Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Mesenchymal Stem
  Cells.
