caption: Differential expression analysis between tumor and normal thyroid tissue.
  (A) Principal component analysis of 44 PTC and matched normal tissue. (B) Proportion
  of known driver mutations identified in tumor samples. (C) Mutational status, sex,
  TDS, and ERK score in individual tumors. TDS and ERK scale represent Log2-scaled
  high and low thyroid differentiation and ERK-activation based on gene signatures
  []. (D) Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes. (E) Hierarchical clustering
  of the top 100 differentially expressed lncRNAs (scaled normalized reads by column).
  FDR, false discovery rate; TDS, thyroid differentiation score.
