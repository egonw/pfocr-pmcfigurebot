caption: 'Inhibition of ROCK alleviated STZ-induced retinal dysfunction in mice. (A)
  Retinal thickness was measured in HE-stained sections. Scale bar: 50 µm. GCL, ganglion
  cell layer, IPL, inner plexiform layer, INL, inner nuclear layer, OPL, outer plexiform
  layer, ONL, outer nuclear layer. (B) PAS staining of the retinal capillary network.
  The arrows indicate acellular capillaries. Acellular capillaries were counted in
  six random fields per retinal flat mount. Scale bar: 50 µm. **P < 0.05, ****P <
  0.0001 compared with the control group; ##P < 0.05, ####P < 0.0001 compared with
  the DR group. The bars are the mean ± SD.'
