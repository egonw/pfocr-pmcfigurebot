caption: 'Inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway with BAY 11-7082 reversed the
  effect of TMAO on osteoclast differentiation. (A,B) BMMs were pretreated with 10
  μM BAY 11-7082 for 1 h before being cultured with or without 400 µM TMAO. The number
  of TRAP-positive osteoclasts increased under 400 μM TMAO and decreased with BAY
  11-7082 pretreatment with or without TMAO. Scale bar = 20 µm. (C) The expression
  of osteoclast-specific genes was up-regulated under 400 μM TMAO and suppressed by
  BAY 11-7082 with or without TMAO treatment evaluated by real-time PCR (n = 3 per
  group). (D,E) The protein expression levels of c-Fos, NFATc1, and the phosphorylation
  of p65 were promoted under 400 μM TMAO and suppressed by BAY 11-7082 with or without
  TMAO treatment as examined by Western blot (n = 3 per group). Con: blank control
  group without RANKL and TMAO; * p < 0.05, #p < 0.01.'
