caption: MicroRNAs related to multiple MAPK signaling pathways or regulated by compounds
  in liver cancer. On the left are microRNAs associated with drug resistance and microRNAs
  regulated by compounds. On the right are microRNAs simultaneously involved in multiple
  MAPK signaling pathways. In addition to the microRNAs affecting a single certain
  pathway, some microRNAs are associated with multiple MAPK signaling pathways and
  have a universal effect on the MAPK signaling network, thereby regulating the development
  of liver cancer. Besides, some microRNAs are related to sorafenib resistance or
  are regulated by some compounds to affect the progression of liver cancer.
