caption: The effects of FDLE on apoptosis induction in non-inflammatory and inflammatory
  HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cell lines. Apoptosis includes early apoptosis
  (LR) and late apoptosis (UR). (A–C) Apoptosis rate of non-inflammatory HCT-116 and
  HT-29 cells treated with three doses (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h. (D–F)
  Apoptosis rate of inflammatory HCT-116 and HT-29 cells treated with three doses
  (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of FDLE for 48 h after adding a mixture of cytokines (TNF-α,
  IFN-γ and LPS each 10 ng/mL) for 2 h. The results were represented as mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.0001.
