figure_title: Transient in vitro RRM2 knockdown in neuroblastoma cells results in
  an increased DNA damage and p53 pathway response, supporting its putative dependency
  role in neuroblastoma
caption: (A) Transient RRM2 knockdown in IMR-32 and CLB-GA neuroblastoma cells using
  two different RRM2-targeting siRNAs (denoted as si61 and si62) significantly down-regulates
  the expression of RRM2 and up-regulates the expression of the p53 target gene CDKN1A
  and the p53-inducible RRM2B gene, as shown by reverse transcription quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. ns, not significant. (B) Immunblotting
  confirms that RRM2-targeting siRNA transfection in IMR-32 and CLB-GA cells strongly
  down-regulates RRM2 protein levels accompanied by DNA damage induction (increased
  pRPA32 and yH2AX signal) and checkpoint activation (increased pCHK1 levels) (see
  quantification in fig. S2). (C) IncuCyte live cell imaging analysis shows a strong
  reduced confluency upon siRRM2_61 transfection and, to a lesser extent, with siRRM2_62
  in IMR-32 and CLB-GA cells. (D) GSEA following RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)â€“based transcriptome
  profiling of IMR-32 and CLB-GA cells transfected with RRM2-targeting siRNAs indicates
  a significant reduced expression of MYC targets and G2-M phase markers (top) and
  up-regulation of p53 target genes (bottom). FDR, false discovery rate; NES, normalized
  enrichment score.
