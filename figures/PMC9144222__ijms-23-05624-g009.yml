caption: The effects of crassolide on the ROS-dependent activation of the ER stress
  pathway, G2/M cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in H460 cells. The H460
  cells were pretreated with NAC for 1 h, treated with 25 μM crassolide for an additional
  24 h, and then harvested. (A) The expression of the autophagy marker (LC3-II) and
  the ER stress-related molecules (pPERK, peIF2α, and CHOP) was examined by Western
  blotting analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal control. (B) Cell cycle distribution,
  (C) the numbers of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells, and (D) autophagy (as measured by
  acridine orange) were assessed by flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean ± SEM
  of three wells from one of three experiments. Moreover, *** p  <  0.001 indicates
  a significant difference from the group treated with crassolide alone.
