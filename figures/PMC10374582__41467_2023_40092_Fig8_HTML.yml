figure_title: Evolutionarily distinct BAHD acyltransferase activity completes the
  detoxification pathway of bitter steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in tomato
caption: 'GAME36 proteins performing acetylation reactions in SGA biosynthesis form
  a distinct monophyletic clade (marked in red) in phylogenetic analysis comprising
  all tomato BAHDs. Functionally characterized BAHD proteins appearing in separate
  clades according to their functional diversity in tomato are marked in different
  colors in phylogenetic tree. Amino acid sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis
  are provided in Supplementary Data . The evolutionary history was inferred using
  the maximum-likelihood method in MEGAX using 1000 bootstrap replications. Sequences
  from the following species were represented: cultivated tomato [S. lycopersicum,
  (Sl)], cultivated potato [S. tuberosum, (St)], wild tomato [S. pennellii, (Sp)]
  and cultivated eggplant [S. melongena, (Sm)]. ASAT, acylsugar acyltransferase; HCT;
  hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; DCR; defective in cuticular
  ridges; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; SHT, spermidine
  N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases; AAT1, alcohol acetyltransferase 1; ACT2, aliphatic
  amine acyltransferase 2; FdAT1, Flavonoid-3-O-rutinoside-4”‘-phenylacyltransferase
  1 (FdAT1); GAME36, glycoalkaloid metabolism36.'

  glycoalkaloids in ripe tomato fruit.
