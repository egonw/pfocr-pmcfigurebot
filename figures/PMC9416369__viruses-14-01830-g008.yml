caption: 'Effect of foliar application of B. amyloliquefaciens strain TBorg1-CF on
  the expression of genes encoding polyphenol biosynthetic pathway enzymes (cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase, C4H; hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, HCT; chalcone isomerase, CHI)
  and pathogenesis-related (PR-1, PR-2 and PR-5) proteins of tomato plants at 21 dpi.
  Mock: tomato plants inoculated with viral inoculation buffer and foliar sprayed
  with sterile bacteria-free broth medium; TMV: tomato plants inoculated with TMV
  and foliar sprayed with sterile bacteria-free broth medium; TB: tomato plants sprayed
  with TBorg1-CF 24 h prior to viral infection; TA: tomato plants sprayed with TBorg1-CF
  24 h following viral infection.; TBA: tomato plants were sprayed twice, once 24
  h before and once 24 h after viral inoculation, with TBorg1-CF. Each value in a
  column is the average Â± SD of the results from five biological replicates. The average
  values of the columns with the same letter do not differ significantly.'
