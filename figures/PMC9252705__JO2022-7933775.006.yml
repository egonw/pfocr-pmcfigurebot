caption: Neferine impeded tumorigenesis and induced ferroptosis in vivo involving
  in the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway. (a) Representative images of tumors from nude mice
  in the control group and neferine 20 mg/kg group. (b, c) The tumor volumes and mice
  body weight were monitored every five days. ∗∗P < 0.01. (d) Tumor samples were weighted
  after mice were administrated with 30 days. ∗∗P < 0.01vs. 0 mg/kg neferine. (e–g)
  The apoptosis and VEGF expression were detected by TUNEL and IHC, respectively.
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001vs. 0 mg/kg neferine. (h) The relative protein expressions of SLC7A11
  and GPX4 were examined by the western blot. The data were expressed after being
  normalized to β-actin. ∗∗∗P < 0.001vs. control. (i) The relative protein expressions
  of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were assessed by the western blot. The data were expressed
  after being normalized to lamin B1 or β-actin. ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001vs. control.
  (j, k) The levels of ROS (j) and GSH (k) were measured using commercial kits. ∗∗P
  < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001vs. 0 mg/kg neferine. All assays were performed in triplicate.
