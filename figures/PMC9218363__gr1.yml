caption: PP2AC expression level is directly correlated with disease progression and
  the survival of patients with CRC(A) Box plot depicting a summary of the TCGA data
  quantification of PPP2CB in normal tissue and CRC tumors (left), different stages
  (middle), and different nodal progressions (right).(B) Box plot showing the CPTAC
  data quantitation of PP2AC protein levels in normal tissues and CRC tumors (left),
  and different stages of progression (right).(C) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of
  TCGA data was plotted for the CRC cases that were high and low in PPP2CB expression.
  The p-value is shown at the top of each graph. See also .
