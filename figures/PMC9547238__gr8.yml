caption: SLC7A5 deficiency in LUAD cells suppresses tumor proliferation, migration,
  mTORC1 pathway activity and is less sensitive to rapamycin in vitro. A549 cells
  (A) and PC9 cells (B) transfected by SLC7A5 siRNAs were used for cell proliferation
  assay. A549 cells (C) and PC9 cells (D) transfected by SLC7A5 siRNAs were used for
  wound healing assay. The data were presented as the mean ± SD; n = 3. The cell viability
  of A549 cells (E) and PC9 cells (F) transfected by SLC7A5 siRNAs was assessed by
  SRB dyeing assays with rapamycin treatment. The data were presented as the mean
  ± SD; n = 6. Indicators of Epithelial-mesenchylmal transition (EMT) (G), DNA damage
  response (H), hypoxia, angiogenesis, and growth factors signaling (I) were detected
  by qRT-PCR in PC9 cells transfected by SLC7A5 siRNAs. The indicated proteins related
  to mTORC1 pathway were detected by western blotting in A549 (J) and PC9 (K) cells
  with or without SLC7A5 siRNAs. The non-adjusted images were presented in supplementary
  WB bands 2 and 3, respectively. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
