caption: NEFA induced apoptosis in BMECs. (A–C) Relative mRNA expression of Caspase3,
  Bax, and Bcl2 in BMECs after treatment with various concentrations (0.3, 0.6, and
  0.9 mM) of NEFA for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h. (D,E) Protein expression of Caspase3, Bax,
  and Bcl2 in BMECs stimulated with the different concentrate of NEFA for 6 h. (F,G)
  Cell apoptosis detected by flow cytometry using annexin V FITC/PI double staining.
  Data are presented as the means ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
