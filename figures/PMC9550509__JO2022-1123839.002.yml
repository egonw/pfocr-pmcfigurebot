caption: 'FAM201A overexpression increased CC cell viability and promoted migration
  by downregulating miR-1271-5p expression. (a-d) The expressions of FAM201A (a, b)
  and miR-1271-5p (C/D) in CC (SiHa and ME180) cells transfected with FAM201A overexpression
  plasmids or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination were analyzed by qRT-PCR.
  (e, f) The viability of CC (SiHa and ME180) cells after transfection with FAM201A
  overexpression plasmids or miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination was measured
  by CCK-8 assay at 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-transfection. (g-i) The migration of CC
  (SiHa and ME180) cells after transfection with FAM201A overexpression plasmids or
  miR-1271-5p mimic alone or in combination was evaluated by the Transwell assay (magnification:
  ×250; scale: 50 μm). +P or #P < 0.05; ++P or ^^Por##P < 0.01; +++P or ^^^P or ###P
  < 0.001; + vs. NC+MC; ^vs. FAM201A+MC; # vs. NC+miR-1271-5p M. CC: cervical cancer;
  qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; CCK-8: cell
  counting kit-8; NC: negative control; FAM201A: the family with sequence similarity
  201-member A; M: miR-1271-5p mimic; MC: mimic control.'
