caption: Bmi1-UPF1-HK2 pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis in PC cells. (A) Western
  blot of Bmi1, SLC2A1, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA protein in PC cells transfected with vector
  or Bmi1 plasmid. (B) Western blot of Bmi1 and HK2 protein in PC cells after transfection
  with ncRNA or Bmi1 siRNA under different glycemic conditions. (C) The GEPIA web
  tool was adopted to search for the correlation between the expression of Bmi1 and
  UPF1 in mRNA level in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples. P values as indicated
  in the Figure. (D) The GEPIA web tool was adopted to search for the correlation
  between the expression of UPF1 and HK2 at mRNA levelsin pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  samples. P-values as indicated in the Figure. (E) Western blot of Bmi1 and UPF1
  protein in PC cells transfected with vector or Bmi1 plasmid. (F) Western blot of
  Bmi1, UPF1, and HK2 protein in sh-control or sh-UPF1 PC cells transfected with vector
  or Bmi1 plasmid. (G) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was used to detect the
  binding between UPF1 and HK2 mRNA. (H) HK2 mRNA half-life measured by qRT-PCR after
  actinomycin D treatment. (I) Bar graphs depicting lactate production with or without
  2-DG (5 mM) in PC cells after transfection with ncRNA or Bmi1 oeRNA. Data presented
  in the graphs represented means ± standard deviation from 3 parallel experiments.
  (J) Bar graphs depicting flow cytometric analysis of activated cytotoxic T-cell
  (INFγ+ and CD8+) population in co-culture of primary T-cells and PC cells transfected
  with vector or Bmi1 plasmid pretreated with or without 2-DG (5 mM). (K) Bar graphs
  depicting the levels of soluble IL-2 of Jurkat T-cells with the conditional medium
  of PC cells transfected with vector or Bmi1 plasmid pretreated with or without 2-DG
  (5 mM). ∗∗∗P < .001; ∗∗P < .01; ∗P < .05.
