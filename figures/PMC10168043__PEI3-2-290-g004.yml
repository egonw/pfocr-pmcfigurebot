caption: Heatmaps showing differential regulation of genes under cold stress and normal
  conditions. Illustrative representation of genes involved in (a) reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production and scavenging along with regulation of nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), (b) proline biosynthesis via glutamate pathway,
  its promoters and inhibitors along with ornithine pathway, (c) chlorophyll biosynthesis,
  light harvesting complex, and non‐photo quenching genes, (d) stomatal conductance,
  (e) growth and development‐related genes in respective clusters. Normalized FPKM
  [Log2 (FPKM + 1)] values for each gene are from four different time‐points (0, 1,
  3, and 5 days) under cold and normal conditions. Color gradient from red to green
  indicate low to high expression of genes

  response of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to low temperature stress during
  seedling establishment.
