caption: Detection of VEGFR-2 in NSCLC tumor sections via IHC, and survival analysis
  for patients with high/low VEGFR-2 expression. (A) NSCLC tumor sections were stained
  for VEGFR-2 expression (brown). Tumor sections in early and late stages of NSCLC
  with low and high expression of VEGFR-2 localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.
  (B) Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis of late-stage NSCLC patients demonstrated a difference
  in survival time from date of diagnosis in patients with high vs. low expression
  of VEGFR-2. The equality of survival distributions for the two expression groups
  was assessed by way of a log-rank test with p < 0.05 indicating a significant difference
  in survival.
