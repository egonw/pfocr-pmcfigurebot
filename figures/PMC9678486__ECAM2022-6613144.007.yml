caption: 'Dependence of the regulation of the acupuncture stimulation corneal cytokines
  through α7nAChR. The α7nAChR antagonist α-BGT reverses the inhibitory effect of
  acupuncture stimulation on corneal cytokines. Quantitative data are expressed as
  mean ± SEM. The group Scop + Acup + α-BGT had upregulated IL-1b, IL-21, MMP-9, and
  TNF-a expression levels when compared with the group Scop + Acup. #P < 0.05 and
  ##P < 0.01 vs. group Scop; %P < 0.05 vs. group Scop + Acup.'
