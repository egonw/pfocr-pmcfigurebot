caption: 'Ectopic RAD21L and REC8 mei-CC complexes induce distinct chromosome phenotypes
  and transcriptional response. (A) Analysis of RAD21L-P2A cleavage in vivo. Two variants
  of DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L-P2A, DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L, and DLD-1 (control) cells
  were induced for 72 h. The amino and carboxyl-terminal proteolytic fragments are
  marked with N* and C* in the left panel (RAD21L Ab IP) and with asterisks in the
  right panel (chromatin fractionation). Anti-FLAG Ab were included to reliably identify
  short N-terminal fragments. (B) IF of induced(72 h) DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L and
  DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L-P2A stained for RAD21L. (Scale bars, 10 μm throughout.)
  (C) ATAC-seq of DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L compared to DLD-1 control. The chart represents
  all peaks in the two cell lines. Density plots below are for nonrepeat centered
  peaks <1 kb, either present in both datasets (Top) or in mei-CC cells only (Bottom).
  (D) MA plots from RNA-seq of DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3, DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L, DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-REC8,
  and DLD-1. Induction 72 h. For DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L DEGs included regulatory
  proteins: kinases and their cofactors PLK2, MAP3K14, ERBB3, EPHA2, LATS2, STK17A,
  and PEA15; phosphatases PPP1R15A, DUSP6, and DUSP5; chromatin components H2BFS,
  HIST1H2BK, HIST1H1C, HMGA2, MRNIP, and BMI1; cytoskeleton components KIFC3, TUBB6,
  TUBB2A, and PLEC; and apoptotic hippo pathway components LATS2, STK17A, and SAV1.
  (E) A heat map of differential expression for 50 most affected genes in all RNA-seq
  experiments combined. (F) Correspondence of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq for 439 TSS of
  affected genes; 326 sites are also qualified as enhancers (GeneHancer), and 98 significant
  DEGs are highlighted, with some example genes. (G) Proteome analysis of DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-REC8,
  DLD-1SMC1B-STAG3-RAD21L, and DLD-1 cells by iTRAQ mass spectrometry. Volcano plots
  only include proteins with more than one unique peptide. Cohesin pathway proteins
  are highlighted in red. Significance thresholds (vertical blue lines) correspond
  to 1.2 times fold change and the horizontal blue line is 0.05 q-value. Induction
  for 72 h.'
