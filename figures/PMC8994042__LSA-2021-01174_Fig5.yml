figure_title: WT IFITM3 accumulation in the cis-Golgi alters glycoproteins trafficking
caption: (A) WT and IFITM1, 2, 3 KO cells were transfected with DNA coding for VSVg
  before confocal microscopy analysis (qualitative analysis and representative pictures
  obtained). (B) HeLa WT and IFITMs-KO cells were either transfected with DNA coding
  for a GFP marker or for VSVg before flow cytometry analysis. To quantify the amount
  of VSVg arriving at the plasma membrane, cells were labeled with an anti-VSVg antibody,
  before fixation and analysis. Typical panels obtained and overall changes in the
  median fluorescent intensity (MFI) in the different conditions. * and ns, statistically
  significant and nonsignificant P-values after unpaired two-tailed t tests between
  the indicated conditions. Source data are provided in the relevant section.Source
  data are available for this figure.
