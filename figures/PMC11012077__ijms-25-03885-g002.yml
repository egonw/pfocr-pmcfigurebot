caption: Fractalkine role in the pathomechanisms of NO-CAD. Main leading causes of
  NO-CAD are coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), atherosclerotic changes within
  the coronary microcirculation and inflammation, which underlies these processes.
  In an inflamed endothelium there is an increased production of FKN/CX3CL1, which
  activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways via its receptor CX3CR1. FKN/CX3CL1
  can bind to CX3CR1 expressed by monocytes, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells
  acting as a specific adhesion molecule, attracting these cells to the artery wall
  inflammatory process []. Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium is an initial stage
  of atherosclerosis. Recruited monocytes then transform into macrophages, engulf
  lipids, and exhibit morphological features of foam cells []. CX3CL1/CX3CR1 interactions
  regulate cell migration and proliferation through the Pl3K/Act signaling pathway.
  FKN/CX3CL1 induces vascular dysfunction by stimulating vascular ROS resulting in
  reduced NO bioavailability []. The decreased production of NO by impaired ECs increases
  collagen deposition, reduces angiogenesis and promotes the conversion of ECs into
  mesenchymal cells, leading to microvascular rarefaction []. Endothelial activation—defined
  by endothelial expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin—is mainly due
  to activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade. NFĸB controls expression of FKN/CX3CL1
  []. NFĸB can be activated through classical complex (IKKα/β/γ) and alternative pathways
  (NIK-mediated activation of IKKα). In the classical pathway, NFĸB dimers RelA/p50
  are released from NFĸB inhibitors (IĸB). The non-classical pathway is activated
  by factors of TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members (TNFRSF). Direct activation
  of NFĸB-inducing kinase (NIK) phosphorylates an IKKα, which in turn leads to the
  liberation of the RelB/p52 complex []. In hypoxia, FKN/CX3CL1, which causes the
  adhesion of CX3CR1 expressing immune cells to ECs, leads to EC dysfunction and the
  initiation of a perivascular inflammatory response. Hypoxia and TNF-α increase hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression via activation of the NFĸB classical pathway []. The
