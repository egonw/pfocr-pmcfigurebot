caption: 'Volcano plot of differentially expressed proteins and Gene Ontology annotation
  analysis. A: Volcano plot of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The horizontal
  axis is the relative quantitative value of protein after log2 conversion, and the
  vertical axis is the P value of difference significance test after -log10 conversion;
  B: Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis of DEPs. The number of DEPs categorized
  as biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components; C: GO enrichment
  analysis of DEPs. The Y axis denotes the GO functional classification enriched by
  the DEPs, and the X axis denotes the −log10 of the P value of Fisher’s exact test
  of the significance of the enrichment; D: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The
  Y axis denotes the categories of KEGG pathways. The X axis is the −log10 of the
  P value of Fisher’s exact test of the significance of enrichment.'
