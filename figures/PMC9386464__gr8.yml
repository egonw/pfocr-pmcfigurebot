caption: A model depicting the role of CCNC in BAT development and function. At embryonic
  stage (A), CCNC deletion in brown adipocyte progenitor cells results in prenatal
  BAT paucity due to impairment of brown adipocyte progenitor cell proliferation,
  while at postnatal stage (B), CCNC deficiency in mature brown adipocytes leads to
  reduced lipid accumulation because of the inhibition of C/EBPα-GLUT4-ChREBP -mediated
  lipid synthesis pathway. Thus, CCNC plays an important role in both BAT development
  and lipid accumulation in brown adipocytes. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)
