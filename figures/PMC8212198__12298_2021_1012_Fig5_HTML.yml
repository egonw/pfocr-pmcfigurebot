caption: Core pathway for anthocyanin biosynthesis, showing related pathways for flavonol
  and flavone synthesis. The phenylpropane metabolic pathway is catalyzed by phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyases (PALs), cinnamate 4-hydroxylases (C4Hs) and 4-coumaryol CoA ligase
  (4CLs). Enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis are chalcone synthases (CHSs),
  chalcone isomerizes (CHIs) and flavanone 3-hydroxylases (F3Hs). Anthocyanins are
  synthesized by dihydroflavonol 4-reductases (DFRs) and anthocyanidin synthases (ANSs),
  proanthocyanidins are synthesized by anthocyanidin reductases (ANRs) and leucoanthocyantin
  reductases (LARs)
