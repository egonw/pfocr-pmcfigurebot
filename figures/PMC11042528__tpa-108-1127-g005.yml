caption: MEK/ERK pathway is required for metabolic reprogramming of proinflammatory
  macrophages. Bone marrow cells were isolated from WT and DKO mice for the differentiation
  of BMDMs. At day 6, BMDMs were treated with 24-h LPS plus IFN-γ stimulation to induce
  proinflammatory macrophages. After polarization, various experiments were performed.
  A, Schematic of the experimental workflow. B, ATP levels of naive and proinflammatory
  macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual (n = 6 per
  group, mean ± SD, 2-way ANOVA test). C, Seahorse analysis of ECAR in naive (left
  panel) and proinflammatory (right panel) macrophages from WT or DKO mice. D, Seahorse
  analysis of basal glycolysis and maximum glycolysis in naive (left panel) and proinflammatory
  (right panel) macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual
  (n = 5 per group, mean ± SD, 2-way ANOVA test). E, Seahorse analysis of baseline
  respiration (left panel) and maximum respiration (right panel) in naive and proinflammatory
  macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual (n = 5 per
  group, mean ± SD, 2-way ANOVA test). F, Representative flow cytometry histogram
  (left panel) and quantity chart (right panel) of glucose uptake in naive and proinflammatory
  macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual (n = 3 per
  group, mean ± SD, 2-way ANOVA test). G, Representative flow cytometry histogram
  (left panel) and quantity chart (right panel) of mitochondrial mass in naive and
  proinflammatory macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual
  (n = 3 per group, mean ± SD, 2-way ANOVA test). H, Representative flow cytometry
  histogram (left panel) and quantity chart (right panel) of mitochondrial membrane
  potential in naive and proinflammatory macrophages from WT or DKO mice. (n = 3 per
  group, mean ± SD). Each symbol represents 1 individual (n = 3 per group, mean ± SD,
  2-way ANOVA test). I, Representative mitochondria images (left panel), quantity
  chart of mitochondrial number (middle panel), and length-to-width ratio (right panel)
  in proinflammatory macrophages from WT or DKO mice. Each symbol represents 1 individual
  (n = 8 per group, mean ± SD, 2-tailed unpaired Student t test). All the data are
  representative of at least 3 independent experiments (F–H). BMDM, bone marrow–derived
  macrophage; DKO, double-gene knockout; ECAR, extracellular acidification rate; IFN,
  interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; WT, wild type.
