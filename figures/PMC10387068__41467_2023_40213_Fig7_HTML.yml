figure_title: Cluster analysis of FZD5 micro-switch mutants
caption: a Heat map showing combined response for the 26 FZD5 micro-switch mutants
  and wild-type FZD5 in five different assays (six parameters). Raw mean values for
  each assay were rescaled to a range between 0 and 1 for comparability. Mutants were
  ordered by similarity using a clustering algorithm (‘ward.D2’ function from R package
  cluster). Best clustering of mutants was obtained using three different clusters
  (colored in blue, yellow, and purple) according to silhouette analysis. (b) Principal
  component analysis (PCA) of mutants based on the results shown in (a). The color
  of points represents main clusters as shown in (a). X- and Y-axis show principal
  components 1 and 2, size of points encodes principal component 3. c, d Snake plot
  (c) and 3D model (d) of human FZD5 without N-and C-termini showing the 26 mutated
  residues colored in blue, yellow and purple according to cluster analysis in (a).
  Amino acids colored in gray represent mutants, which were not expressed. C-term
  C terminus, ECL extracellular loop, ICL intracellular loop, N-term N terminus, TM1-6
  transmembrane domain, H8 Helix 8.
