figure_title: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway up-regulation relieves a low glucose-induced
  deficiency in N-glycan elongation in the ER
caption: '(A) Abundance of UDP-HexNAc in human bronchial epithelial cells cultured
  for 48 h in 0.1 mM glucose and supplemented or not with 25 mM GlcNAc, presented
  as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of compound of interest/AUC of internal
  standard. ***P < 0.001 (unpaired t test, n = 6 independent experiments, mean ± SEM).
  (A, B) Representative Western blotting of N-GlcNAc2–modified proteins (CTD110.6
  antibody) and O-GlcNAcylation modifications (RL2 antibody) in human bronchial epithelial
  cells cultured as in (A). Tubulin is used as a loading control. (C) Upper part:
  luciferase assay of Hek293 ER-LucT cells grown for 24 and 48 h in glucose-limited
  conditions (0.1 mM) with or without GlcNAc supplementation. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05
  (unpaired t test, n = 4 independent experiments, mean ± SEM). Bottom part: representative
  Western blotting of luciferase in Hek293 ER-LucT cultured under the same conditions.
  Tubulin is used as a loading control. (D) Representative Western blotting of luciferase
  in Hek293 ER-LucT grown for 48 h in 10, 1 or 0.1 mM glucose (Glc)-containing medium
  with or without GlcNAc supplementation. Cell lysates were treated or not with Endo
  H or PNGase. Tubulin is used as a loading control.Source data are available for
  this figure.'
