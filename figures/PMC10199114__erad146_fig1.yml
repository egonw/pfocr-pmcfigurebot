caption: ZmWRKY28 connecting GA–DELLA and COP1–HY5 pathways. PhyB is activated upon
  sensing the high red (R) to far-red (FR) light ratio. Activated PhyB (PhyB*) blocks
  COP1 to degrade HY5 and induces photomorphogenesis. HY5 also blocks the GA response,
  thus keeping DELLA (D8) active. D8 represses ZmWRKY28 and subsequent downstream
  steps of the skotomophogenic pathway. In the dark, PhyB activates COP1 to degrade
  HY5. In the absence of Hy5, GA degrades D8. Without the D8 suppression, ZmWRKY28
  activates the expression of skotomopogenic pathway genes [ZmPIF4.1 and SMALL AUXIN‐UP
  RNA 54 (SAUR54)], and eventually induces other hormones responsible for skotomophogenesis
  (i.e. auxin). Black and orange arrows indicate dark- and light-activated pathways,
  respectively. Plain arrows indicate direct and dashed arrows indicate indirect/speculative
  regulation. This figure shows only the components discussed by .
