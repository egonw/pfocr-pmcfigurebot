figure_title: Dietary restriction of methionine/cystine downregulated cellular methionine
  metabolism in ESCC
caption: A–D The content of Methionine (A), SAM (B), SAH (C), and Glutathione (GSH)
  (D) were detected in tumor tissues from both CTR and MCR groups when tumors tissues
  were harvested on day 31. E–H The content of Methionine (E), SAM (F), SAH (G), and
  Glutathione (GSH) (H) were detected in peripheral blood from both CTR and MCR groups
  when blood samples were collected on day 31st. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t test. n = 5 for each group. Data are presented as mean ± SD
  (n = 3).
