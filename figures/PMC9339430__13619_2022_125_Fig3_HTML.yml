caption: 'Efforts on the functional maturation of human PSC-derived pancreatic β cells.
  The pancreatic β cells derived from human PSCs showed limited functional maturity.
  The expression of genes related to insulin transcription and secretion enables immature
  β cells to respond to high glucose levels with an appropriate insulin release, showing
  static GSIS with limited function. Dynamic GSIS with first- and second-phase insulin
  secretion has been achieved by regulating TGF-β signal pathway, reaggregation and/or
  metabolic regulation, but the amount of insulin secreted in the second stage is
  still low. Metabolic maturation of β cells, together with the microenvironment and
  islet structure considerations contribute to the functional maturity of human PSC-derived
  pancreatic β cells. GSIS: glucose-stimulated insulin secretion'
