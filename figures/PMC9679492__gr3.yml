caption: Usnic Acid extended healthspan through inhibition mTOR signaling pathway(A)
  Survival of rsks-1(ok1255) treated with 2 μM UA and the untreated controls. (log-rank
  test).(B) Survival of rsks-1RNAi treated with 2 μM UA and the untreated controls.
  (log-rank test). (A and B) See  for lifespan data.(C) Quantification of “aging pigments”
  by measuring lipofuscin fluorescence normalized to autoflourescence in 2 μM UA-treated
  empty vector (EV), let-363 RNAi and rsks-1 RNAi versus the control (n ≥ 20). (unpaired
  t-test).(D) Locomotion as determined by the number of body bends per min in 2 μM
  UA-treated empty vector (EV), let-363 RNAi and rsks-1 RNAi versus the control (n
  ≥ 20). (unpaired t-test).(E) Western blot analysis of the phosphorylated S6K levels
  when worms were exposed to 2 μM UA versus the control. (∗p < 0.05, unpaired t-test).
  Error bars represent mean ± SEM of 3 independent biological replicates. NS, no significance.
