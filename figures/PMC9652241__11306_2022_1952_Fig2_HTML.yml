caption: Metabolite concentrations in colorectal cancer tissue superimposed on a metabolic
  pathway map that included glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino acids. Columns, average
  concentration (nmol/g tissue) of tumor tissues based on low-FDG and high-FDG metabolic
  tumor volume; bars, SD. All P values were evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test.
