caption: 'Graphic representation of the most relevant pathways regulating sustaining
  proliferative signaling in oral squamous cell carcinomas. (A) Tyrosine kinase receptors
  (e.g., EGFR or ErbB2) may be activated on the cell membrane by extracellular growth
  factors (e.g., EGF) or by constitutive mutations of the genes that encode them.
  Consequently, (B) Ras is downstream activated through the stimulation of these receptors,
  although Ras can be also activated by mutations, representing an influential central
  point in oral carcinogenesis, able to stimulate two important downstream oncogenic
  pathways: PI3K (pathway graphically represented in purple) and/or MAPK (pathway
  graphically represented in pink). (C) The PI3K pathway (PI3K-Akt-mTor, green), which
  can be blocked by its potent supressor PTEN (C), regulates the downstream translation
  of CCND1 mRNA via mTor (C). This pathway can also be constitutively activated by
  PI3K mutations (C). In parallel, (D) the endpoint of the MAPK pathway (Raf-MEK-Erk;
  in pink), which can also be activated by the constitutive mutation of Raf (D), is
  the Erk-mediated transcriptional activation of CCND1 (D). A third key pathway in
  the oncogenic activation of cyclin D1 is (E) NF-kB (in blue), which can be activated
  by IKK, as a consequence of PI3K pathway activation. (F) CCND1 transcriptional activation
  mediated by ERK, and the mTor-mediated translation of its messenger RNA, are both
  essential for the ribosomal synthesis of cyclin D1, which forms complexes with its
  binding partners, CDK4/6, that finally translocate to the nucleus. (G) Nuclear Cyclin
  D1-CDK4/6 complexes subsequently activate the retinoblastoma pathway, in which the
  release of transcription factors E2F is induced by the translocation of a phosphato
  group, (H) with progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The activation
  of the retinoblastoma pathway can be prevented (I) through the potent inhibition
  of Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 by the product of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A (i.e., p16INK4),
  blocking cell cycle advance, or alternatively by the tumor supressor p53 (J), which
  plays an important role arresting cell cycle progression, repairing the damaged
  DNA or finally promoting apoptosis, in an effort to prevent sustaining proliferation
  in cancer cells (adapted with permission from []).'
