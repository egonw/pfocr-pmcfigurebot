caption: RUT increases the viability of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells. (A) Structure of
  RUT. (B) Cell viability after treatment with different doses of RUT, as determined
  by CCK-8 assay. (C) Cell viability after LPS treatment with or without RUT pretreatment
  was determined by CCK-8 assay. Results are presented as the mean Â± SD. *P<0.05,
  ***P<0.001. CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RUT, rutaecarpine.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
