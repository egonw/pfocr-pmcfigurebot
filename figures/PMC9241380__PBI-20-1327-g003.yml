caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment and GO functional classification of differentially
  expressed genes in WD events grown in a greenhouse. Statistically significantly
  enriched (FDR < 0.05) KEGG pathways in (a) and Gene Ontology terms in (b) are shown
  for the DEGs identified at each developmental stage. Three GO categories are presented,
  including Biological Processes (BP), Cellular Compartment (CC), and Molecular Function
  (MF). The gene count represents the number of non‐unique DEGs enriched in a pathway.
  The absence of a dot indicates the pathway was not significantly enriched in that
  developmental stage. Gene ratio was calculated as the number of DEGs involved in
  a pathway divided by the total number of soybean genes in the pathway. Enriched
  GO terms resulting from AgriGOv2 were consolidated into fewer non‐redundant GO terms
  using Revigo (http://revigo.irb.hr) for visualization purposes in (b) (FDR < 0.05).
  DAP: days after pollination. TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
