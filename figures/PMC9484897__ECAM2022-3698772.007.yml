caption: 'Effect of inhibition of ROS/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway on ferroptosis
  in REA-treated EC cells. (a) Transmission electron microscopy observation of Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells (15000x, scale bar, 500 nm); (b) flow cytometric analysis of Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells ROS; (c) results of flow cytometric detection of changes in the
  mitochondrial membrane potential of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (d) ROS fluorescence
  intensity of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (e) JC-1 red/green percentage of Eca109 and
  KYSE150 cells; (f) the content of MDA, SOD, GSH, and GPXS in Eca109 and KYSE150
  cells; (g) the mRNA expression of GPX4 in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells; (h) the protein
  expression of GPX4 in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells. The data were expressed after being
  normalized to β-actin. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared with the
  control group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01; compared with the 2IC50 group, #P < 0.05
  and ##P < 0.01; compared with the shRNA-ASK1 group, ΔP < 0.05 and ΔΔP < 0.01; compared
  with the SB203580 group, ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01.'
