caption: ASS1 is identified to be upregulated in PGAM1 knockdown BC cells. (A) Venn
  diagram showing the DEGs between the shScr and shPGAM1 groups (n = 3). (B, C) The
  specific changes of DEGs in shScr and the shPGAM1 groups are shown by heat maps
  (n = 3). (D, E) The mRNA levels of DEGs in the shScr and shPGAM1 groups detected
  by RT‐PCR (n = 3). (F, G) The protein levels of PGAM1 and ASS1 measured by western
  blot (n = 3). (H–K) The interaction between PGAM1 and ASS1 demonstrated through
  co‐IP assay (n = 3). (Data was analyzed by t‐test, and was shown as the mean ± SD.
  ns, no statistically significant; *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.).
