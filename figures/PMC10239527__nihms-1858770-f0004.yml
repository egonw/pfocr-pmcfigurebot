caption: Gene regulatory network for upregulated DEGs in OA articular cartilage. The
  transcription factors STAT1, BACH1, and RELA were the primary enriched network hubs
  for the pathway analysis (A). Normalized counts as well as the binding motif for
  each transcription factor are presented for RELA (B), STAT1 (C), and BACH1 (D).
  The size of a node represents the degree of a given gene, while the thickness of
  the edge connecting two nodes is positively associated with edge betweenness. BACH1,
  BTB domain and CNC homolog 1; DEG, differentially expressed gene; OA, osteoarthritis;
  STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1.

  in impingement cartilage between patients with femoroacetabular impingement and
  hip osteoarthritis.
