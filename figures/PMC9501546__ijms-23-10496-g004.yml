caption: Decreased migration and invasion of TTYH3 knockdown bladder cancer cells.
  (A) Cell mobility measured by a wound healing assay. The uncovered areas in the
  wound healing assays were quantified as a percentage of the original wound area.
  The area was measured using T-Scratch. Scale bar denotes 500 µm. (B,C) The effect
  of TTYH3 knockdown on cell migration and invasion determined by transwell migration
  assay and basement membrane extract cell invasion assay. Quantifications of migrating
  or invading cells of each cell line are shown as proportions of their vector controls.
  Scale bar denotes 500 µm. (D) Western blot analysis of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins
  in TTYH3-knockdown bladder cancer cell lines. α-tubulin expression was used as the
  control. Bar graphs show the statistical analysis of three independent experiments.
  All the statistical analyses were performed with two-way ANOVA; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p
  ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, and **** p ≤ 0.0001.
