caption: Prenatal ultrasound images. (a) Ultrasonography showed the brain of a normal
  fetus in sagittal section (a1) and in coronal section (a2). The fetus is of 12 weeks
  gestation. (b) Ultrasonography at 12th + 3 week of gestation of the brain of the
  fetal proband in case 1, in sagittal section. An apical hypoechoic bulge about 2.2 × 1.6 cm
  covered with entire envelope (occipital encephalocele?), incomplete skull, and mixed
  intracranial construction can be observed (white arrow in panel b1, b2). (c) Ultrasonography
  at 12th week of gestation of the fetal proband in case 2. An occipital mixed hypoechoic
  bulge about 1.4 × 0.7 cm in size (occipital encephalocele?) along with incomplete
  skull can be seen (yellow arrow in panel c1). The midline has disappeared and replaced
  by multiple anechoic area, one of which is about 0.8 × 0.4 cm
