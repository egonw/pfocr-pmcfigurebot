caption: 'Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) triggers immunoinflammatory responses
  through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway in human endometriotic
  epithelial cells as detected using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).
  mRNA expression levels of (A) proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and
  IFN-γ; (B) proinflammatory chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES; (C) cell adhesion
  molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CD44; (D) inflammatory mediators COX-2, MMP-2, and
  MMP-9. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the housekeeping
  gene. All data are expressed as relative values against their respective control
  group. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (vs. control); # p < 0.05 and ## p <
  0.01 (vs. DEHP treatment).'
