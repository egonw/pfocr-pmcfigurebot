caption: 'NAD+ plays a critical role in LPS‐induced kidney damage. (A) NAD+ metabolism.
  (B) NAD+ levels in kidney cortexes of wild‐type (WT) and NMNAT1−/− (KO) mice under
  different conditions. The levels of BUN (C) and serum creatinine (D) in the indicated
  groups. Hallmarks of renal damage evaluated by kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM‐1)
  (E) and neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin (NGAL) (F) were analysed using
  enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Kidney specimens from each group were evaluated
  using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (scale bars, 50 μm) (H), following by
  tubular injury scores assessment (G). Each result was replicated in three independent
  experiments, and all values are the mean ±SD (n = 3). *Significance compared with
  CON (WT) group (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). #Significance compared with LPS (WT) group
  (#p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01). $Significance compared with CON (KO) group ($p < 0.05,
  $$p < 0.01). ^Significance compared with LPS (KO) group (^p < 0.05, ^^p < 0.01)'
