caption: Bioinformatics analysis comparing post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI)
  and normal post-stroke non-cognitive impairment (PSNCI). (A) Sequencing cluster
  map between the PSCI and PSNCI groups. Different colors indicate relative expression
  levels (log2-transformed). Blue, below-mean expression; red, above-mean expression.
  The colored bar at the top of the panel represents participating groups (blue represents
  PSCI and red represents PSNCI). The colored bar on the right side of the panel indicates
  divisions based on K-means. (B) Volcano plot of DE-miRNAs between PSCI and PSNCI
  groups. On the x-axis, the dotted line indicates DE-miRNAs that satisfied the |log2FC|≥ 1
  cut-off. On the y-axis, the dotted line indicates DE-miRNAs that satisfied P < 0.05.
  Red, highly expressed; purple, lowly expressed. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  results between PSCI and PSNCI. P values are on the X-axis (significance of associations
  between gene sets and GO terms). The Y-axis displays GO terms. (D) The KEGG–pathway
  analysis between PSCI and PSNCI. Gene ratio is proportion of genes in a pathway
  to total genes analyzed (x-axis). Signaling pathways are on the y-axis. Bubble size
  indicates the number of genes enriched in a given pathway. Bubble color reflects
  significance level (bluer is smaller). P-values are log-transformed.
