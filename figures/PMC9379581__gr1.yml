caption: Knockdown of RIOK3 significantly inhibits FAK activation in PDAC cells. Using
  lentiviral transfection, PANC-1 cells with stable knockdown of RIOK3 were created,
  followed by RNA extraction and sequencing. Up-regulated (red) and down-regulated
  (blue) mRNAs were characterized using volcano plots (A). Differential genes (| Log2FC
  | > 0.5, FDR ˂ 0.05) were used to perform a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (B).
  The Log2 FC of all mRNA expression was used in GSEA (C). The spearman correlation
  coefficients of RIOK3 with all other genes in the TCGA-PDAC transcriptome database
  were used in GSEA (D). Western blot assay and quantitative analysis of the protein
  expression of RIOK3, FAK, Phospho-FAK(Tyr397), Phospho-FAK(Tyr925), Integrin 1,
  Integrin 4, and vinculin in cells (E). The qRT-PCR method was used to detect RIOK3
  and FAK mRNA expression (F). Representative IHC staining of RIOK3 and Phospho-FAK(Tyr925)
  in pancreatic cancer tissues and correlation analysis between RIOK3 and Phospho-FAK(Tyr925)
  based on H-Score (G). R represents Pearson correlation coefficient. Analysis of
  the ratio of phospho-FAK/FAK in E (H). The data shown represent the means (±SD)
  of biological triplicates. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ANOVA test. The uncropped images
  of (E) were referred to in .
