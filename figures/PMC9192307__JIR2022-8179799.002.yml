caption: Gene mutation panorama of colorectal cancer patients in the immunotherapy
  cohort (a) and TCGA-COAD cohort (b) and the relationship between PI3K/Akt pathway
  mutations and clinical characteristics (c). (a) The 20 genes with the highest mutation
  frequencies in COAD patients in the immunotherapy cohort and their corresponding
  clinical characteristics are displayed. The mutation frequencies of PIK3CA, ARID1A,
  and PTPRS were significantly increased in the PI3K/Akt-MT group. Yellow represents
  cleavage site mutations, blue represents missense mutations, orange represents frame
  shift mutations, green represents insertion/deletion mutations, and brown represents
  nonsense mutations. (b) The 20 genes with the highest mutation frequencies in patients
  in the TCGA-COAD cohort and their corresponding clinical characteristics are displayed.
  With the exception of KRAS, the mutation frequencies of all other genes changed
  significantly. Yellow represents cleavage site mutations, blue represents missense
  mutations, orange represents frame shift mutations, green represents insertion/deletion
  mutations, and brown represents nonsense mutations. (c) Relationship between PI3K/Akt
  pathway mutations and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, and sample type
  differences in the immunotherapy cohort (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test).
