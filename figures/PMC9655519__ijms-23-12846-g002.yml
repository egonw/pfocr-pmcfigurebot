caption: 'Analysis of differentially phosphorylated proteins in MA-10 Leydig cells
  in response Forskolin. LC-MS/MS was performed on enriched phosphopeptides extracted
  and digested from MA-10 Leydig cells treated with either DMSO (control) or Forskolin
  (Fsk, 10 µm) for 1 h. Phosphorylated proteins were then quantified and compared
  between treatments. Results are the mean of three individual experiments, each performed
  in triplicate. (A) Volcano plot comparing the level of phosphorylated proteins detected
  by LC-MS/MS in control and Fsk-treated MA-10 Leydig cells. Each dot represents a
  distinct phosphoprotein. A Log2 fold change of +/−1.17 (corresponds to 2.25-fold)
  with a p-value of 0.05 was used and is represented by the blue dotted lines. In
  response to Fsk, blue dots depict a decrease in phosphorylation level (two proteins
  are identified in that group: MAPT and PARD3), while red dots correspond to an increase
  in phosphorylation level (four proteins are identified in that group: SRP14, NR4A1,
  RAF1, AKAP1). Grey dots correspond to proteins with no significant changes in phosphorylation
  levels. (B) Heatmap of protein phosphorylation levels for differentially phosphorylated
  proteins between treatment groups (control DMSO vs. Fsk). The name of the protein
  is indicated. The scale on the right represents expression levels (Log10). Biological
  Process (C), Pathway Analysis (D), Cellular Component (E), and Molecular Function
  (F) of the differentially phosphorylated proteins are shown.'
