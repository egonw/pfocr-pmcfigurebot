caption: Effect of ATRA on the proliferation of preadipocytes in Yanbian yellow cattle.
  (a) The MTS method was used to determine the effects of different concentrations
  of ATRA (0, 2 × 10−7, 1 × 10−6, 2 × 10−6, 1 × 10−5, 2 × 10−5 mol/L) on the viability
  of preadipocytes from Yanbian yellow cattle. (b) Flow cytometry was used to determine
  the number of cells in different cell cycle stages. mRNA expression levels of (c)
  PCNA, cyclin D1, and CDK2. * indicates a significant difference compared with the
  blank control group, p < 0.05; ** indicates a highly significant difference compared
  with the blank control group, p < 0.01.
