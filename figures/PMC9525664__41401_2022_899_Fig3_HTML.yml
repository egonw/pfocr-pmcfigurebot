figure_title: In cardiac fibroblasts, IMM-H007 inhibits TGFβ1 expression via AMPKα2,
  but inhibition of Smad2/3 signaling downstream of TGFβ1 is independent of AMPKα2
caption: a CFs were treated with ISO (10 µmol·L−1) for 24 h following IMM-H007 (100 µmol·L−1)
  pretreatment for 2 h. b Representative Western blots of phosphorylated AMPK in WT
  and AMPKα2−/− CFs. c TGFβ1 protein levels in CFs as determined by ELISAs. d Representative
  Western blots of phosphorylated Smad2/3 in WT and AMPKα2−/− CFs. e Western blot
  analysis of collagen I and α-SMA expression in CFs. n = 6; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. AMPK AMP-activated protein
  kinase, CF cardiac fibroblast, IMM IMM-H007, ISO isoprenaline, TGFβ1 transforming
  growth factor β1, WT wild-type.
