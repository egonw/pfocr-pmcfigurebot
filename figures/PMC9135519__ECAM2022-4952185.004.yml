caption: CBX7 overexpression inhibited the tumor growth of lung cancer via deactivating
  the ERK/MAPK pathway in vivo. (a) Representative images of the tumors generated
  by subcutaneously injection with A549 cells transfected with lenti-NC or lenti-CBX7.
  (b) Tumor volume and tumor weight. (c) The expression of CBX7 and Ki-67 in tumor
  tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar = 20 µm. (d) The protein
  levels of CBX7, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p38, and p-p38 in tumor tissues were measured
  by Western blotting. ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. lenti-NC.
