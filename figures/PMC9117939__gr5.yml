caption: MSCs secrete extracellular ATP for activation of the ERK1/2–phospho-c-Fos
  pathway. A, the abundance of cell-surface and mitochondrial ATP synthase was assessed
  using immunocytochemistry with ATP-synthase–complex antibodies in nonpermeable and
  permeable MSCs, respectively. MitoTracker Red was used to label the mitochondria,
  and DAPI was used to stain the nuclei. Scale bar, 20 μm. B, ectopic ATP synthase–positive
  MSCs were assessed using flow cytometry with antibodies against the ATP synthase
  complex or control mouse IgG. In (A) and (B), MSCs incubated with mouse IgG antibodies
  served as the negative control, whereas MSCs permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100
  as the positive control. C, the concentration of extracellular ATP in medium conditioned
  by lung cancer cells (LM and A549) and MSCs was measured and normalized according
  to the number of cells present. D, the extracellular ATP in the conditioned medium
  of MSCs treated with or without the ectopic ATP synthase inhibitors (citreoviridin,
  oligomycin, and CCCP, respectively) in the presence of ADP and Pi was detected.
  The relative eATP concentration was normalized according to the number of cells
  and the control group. E and F, cell proliferation was detected in the LM (E) and
  A549 (F) lung cancer cells treated with or without MSC-CM in the presence or absence
  of ecto-ATPi. All quantified results are shown as mean ± standard deviation. ∗p
  < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, two-tailed t test. CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone;
  CM, conditioned medium; LM, low-motility; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell.
