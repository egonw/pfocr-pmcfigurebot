caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment analysis.
  MGC803 cells were treated with emetine for 18Â h and then used for RNA sequencing
  analysis. A Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on gene expression.
  B Volcano plot revealed the significantly elevated (red dots) and down-regulated
  (green dots) genes in emetine-treated cells. C Heatmap of DEGs between emetine and
  control groups. Two groups were well clustered. D KEGG pathway classification of
  DEGs. E KEGG enrichment analysis (Top 20) of DEGs
article_title: Emetine, a small molecule natural product, displays potent anti-gastric
  cancer activity via regulation of multiple signaling pathways.
