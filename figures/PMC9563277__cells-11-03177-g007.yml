caption: 'Ectopic transcription of EIN2 and EIN3 in tapetum did not influence pollen
  formation. (A) Alexander staining of pollens of pDYT1/Col, pDYT1:EIN2/Col, and pDYT1:EIN3/Col
  transgenic plants. Note, all of the three transgenic populations showed two phenotypes:
  plants showed normal pollens and plants showed partial pollen lethality phenotype.
  Bars = 50 µm. (B) Left panel: The percentage of plants with abnormal anthers in
  each group of the transgenic population. Middle panel: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
  analysis of EIN2 transcript levels in three independent lines of pDYT1:EIN2/Col
  transgenic plants. Right panel: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of EIN3 transcript
  levels in three independent lines of pDYT1:EIN3/Col transgenic plants. β-tubulin
  was used as an internal control for normalization. Data are mean ± SEM of three
  biological replicates with technical duplicates for each.'
