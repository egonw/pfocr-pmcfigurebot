caption: 'The effects of H-120 on STAT3/c-Myc pathway. (A) The expression of STAT3,
  p-STAT3, and c-Myc were measured by Western blotting. (B) Quantification of relative
  protein expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, c-Myc, and β-actin was used as loading
  control; (C) Isolating cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and the expression of STAT3,
  p-STAT3, and c-Myc were measured by Western blotting. (D,E): Quantification of relative
  protein expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, c-Myc, and β-actin was used as loading
  control for cytoplasmic protein; Lamin B1 was used as loading control for nuclear
  protein. Data are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3, * p < 0.05, *** p <0.001, vs.
  the DMSO group).'
