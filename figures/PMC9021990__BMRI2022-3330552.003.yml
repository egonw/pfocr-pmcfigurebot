caption: The regular network. (a) The regulation of ncRNA pivot regulators on dysfunction
  modules. The blue circle represents the module. The purple circle represents the
  ncRNA of the regulatory module. (b) The regulation of the TF pivot regulator on
  dysfunction modules. The blue circle represents the module. The yellow circle represents
  the transcription factor of the regulatory module. The size of the circle represents
  the number of modules that are regulated. The larger the circle, the more the number
  of controls.
