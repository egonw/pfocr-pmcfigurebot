caption: Somatosensory influence on spectral tuning in the auditory midbrain, thalamus,
  and cortex of mice. (A) Schematic of the auditory pathway from midbrain to cortex.
  (B) Frequency response profiles from representative neurons (electrophysiologically
  recorded units) with and without concurrent whisker stimulation. Note the lack of
  effect of whisker stimulation in the CNIC, whereas an additive facilitatory effect
  was observed in the IC shell and in MGBm, and divisive suppression was found in
  MGBv, MGBd and in A1. Recordings in the IC were obtained in both anesthetized and
  awake mice; no differences were observed in the effects of whisker stimulation on
  auditory responses according to whether the mice were anesthetized or not. A1, primary
  auditory cortex; IC, inferior colliculus; CNIC, central nucleus of the IC; MGB,
  medial geniculate body; MGBd, MGBm, MGBv, dorsal, medial and ventral divisions of
  the MGB. Adapted from .
