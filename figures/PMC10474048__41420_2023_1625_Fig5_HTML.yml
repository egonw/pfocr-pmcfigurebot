figure_title: Knockdown of KIF15 may inhibit prostate cancer development through the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
caption: A A KEGG analysis was performed on genes with co-expression patterns with
  KIF15 obtained by coexpedia database. B The expression of several key proteins in
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was detected in DU 145 cells with or without KIF15
  knockdown. C The protein levels of Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, p-PI3K in shCtrl and shKIF15
  DU 145 cells with or without treatment of Akt activator SC79 (10 μM) were detected
  by western blot analysis. D&E, The cell proliferation (D) and cell apoptosis (E)
  of shCtrl and shKIF15 DU 145 cells with or without treatment of Akt activator SC79
  (10 μM) were detected by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. F The expression
  of KIF15, p-PI3K, and p-Akt was detected in clinical specimens by IHC. Data were
  shown as mean with SD. *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01.
