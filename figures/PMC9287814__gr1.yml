caption: Modeling workflow(A) Selected set of metabolic and regulatory pathways involved
  in oxidative stress response (see also ). The network comprises the glutathione,
  glycolytic, and pentose phosphate pathways supplemented with a selected set of allosteric
  and oxidative regulations (red arrows).(B) Modeling workflow from the integration
  of 13C fluxomics and metabolomics data () to parameter estimation of kinetic model
  ensemble and regulation analysis of transient response, dose response, and gain/loss-of-function
  phenotypes.
article_title: Quantitative modeling of pentose phosphate pathway response to oxidative
  stress reveals a cooperative regulatory strategy.
