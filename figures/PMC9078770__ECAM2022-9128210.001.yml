caption: Loureirin B (LrB) improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size in mice
  with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Mice were subjected to MI/R and treated
  with 0.5 mg/kg LrB or 1 mg/kg LrB per day for 4 weeks. Four weeks later, cardiac
  function of the mice was measured, and the cardiac tissues were harvested for further
  examination. (a) Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), (b) left ventricular
  end-systolic diameter (LVESD), (c) left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS),
  and (d) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiographic
  examination. (e) The ratio of heart weight (HW) to body weight (BW). (f) Representative
  photographs of heart cross sections after TTC staining. (g) The percentage of myocardial
  infarct area. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). ++p < 0.01, +++p < 0.001vs.
  sham group. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001vs. MI/R group.
