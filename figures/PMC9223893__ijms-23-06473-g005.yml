caption: 'RvD score identifies putative immunotherapy-responder patients. (A) Heatmap
  of gene expression levels of four targets of immunotherapy (CD274, CTLA4, LAG3,
  PDCD1) in high (n = 100) vs. low (n = 100) RvD score HNSC tumors. mRNA expression
  z-scores relative to diploid samples (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) are shown. Patients are reported
  in columns, genes in row. Color code is shown at the bottom of the panel. Blue:
  lower expression; red: higher expression. (B) Mean gene expression levels (mRNA
  expression z-scores relative to diploid samples) of four immunotherapy targets in
  patients stratified as high (n = 100) and low (n = 100) accordingly to their RvD
  score. ** p < 0.01; ****, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test. (C) Heatmap of gene expression levels of cytolytic compontents of effector
  CD8+ T cells in high (n = 100) vs. low (n = 100) RvD score HNSC tumors. mRNA expression
  z-scores relative to diploid samples (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) are shown. Patients are reported
  in columns, genes in row. Color code is reported at the bottom of the panel. (D)
  Mean relative gene expression (mRNA expression z-scores relative to diploid samples)
  of cytotoxic effectors in patients stratified as high (n = 100) and low (n = 100)
  according to their RvD score. ****, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple
  comparisons test. (E) Cumulative cytolytic score in high (n = 100) vs. low (n =
  100) RvD score tumors. Data, shown as bars, are calculated on RSEM-normalized gene
  expression values. ****, p < 0.0001, Student t test. (F) Heatmap of expression levels
  of genes involved in the PD-1, PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy pathway (IPA). Mean expression
  levels of mRNA z-scores relative to diploid samples in tumors with RvD high (n =
  100) and RvD low (n = 100) score are shown. * p < 0.05; ** < 0.01; *** p < 0.001;
  ****, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. (G) IPA representation
  of the PD-1, PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy pathway reporting up-regulation of immunotherapy
  targets and markers of anti-tumor immunity in T lymphocytes, fibroblasts, M2 macrophages
  and denditic cells.'
