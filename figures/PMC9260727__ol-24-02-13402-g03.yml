caption: 'The interaction between the enhancer and promoter regions of MOSPD1. (A)
  ChIP-qPCR was performed using region-specific primer sets and the precipitants with
  an anti-TCF7L2 antibody or those with normal IgG. The amplification of a region
  upstream of GAPDH was used for normalization. The enhancer region in intron 2 of
  RNF43 was used as a positive control. Data represents mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. A significant difference was determined by unpaired Student''s t-test:
  **P<0.01. (B) Schematic representation of expected chromatin loops in the 3C product.
  (C) An image of gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. The 3C product was amplified
  using four sets of 1st and nested PCR primers. Genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from
  SW480 cells was used as a negative control. (D) The sequence electropherogram of
  the PCR products. MOSPD1, motile sperm domain containing 1; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RNF43, ring finger protein 43;
  3C, chromatin conformation capture.'
