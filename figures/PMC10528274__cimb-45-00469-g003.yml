caption: 'Results of GO and functional enrichment analyses of the top five upregulated
  and downregulated proteins in EVs isolated from ES2 cells treated with both cisplatin
  and paclitaxel. Results of the GO analysis of the top-five upregulated proteins
  (A) and top five downregulated proteins (C) Results of the pathway enrichment analysis
  of five upregulated proteins (B) and five downregulated proteins (D). The results
  are presented in the following three categories: biological process, cellular component,
  and molecular function. Each bar represents the number of proteins. GO, gene ontology.'
