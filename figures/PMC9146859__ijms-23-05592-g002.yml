caption: Effects of ART and HIV infection on lipid and cholesterol regulatory genes.
  ART may cause lipodystrophy in HIV patients administered with PIs or NRTIs. PIs
  inhibit ZMPSTE24, which processes the farnesylated prelamin-A/C, inducing its accumulation.
  Prelamin-A/C sequesters S.R.E.B.P., decreasing its activity on PPAR-γ, impairing
  the regulation of adipogenesis transcription, and promoting the HIV-associated cardiomyopathy
  by NF-kB-induced inflammation. NRTIs inhibit mtDNA polymerase-γ transcription, leading
  to mtDNA depletion, which causes lipodystrophy and hepatosteatosis mediated by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Besides this, ART increases miR34a, promoting hepatosteatosis, cardiomyopathy,
  and OS HDL-C with Apo1 participates in the RCT from peripheral tissues into circulation
  and the liver. HIV infection via Nef harms the monocyte-macrophage cholesterol efflux
  by increasing ABCA1 degradation; also, the downregulation of genes related to cholesterol
  uptake (LDLR and SCARB1/3), synthesis (HMGCR), and regulation (SREBP2 and LXRα).
  The HIV matrix protein p17 enhances the expression and transcriptional activity
  of LXR, and its coactivator (MED1), via the activation of Jak/STAT signaling, which
  results in hepatic lipid accumulation via activation of the LXR/SREBP1c lipogenic
  pathway and mediates liver steatosis. HIV-positive patients on ART present gallstones
  and higher total cholesterol with significantly elevated LDL-C levels but decreased
  scavenging LDLR for LDL-C. The transcriptional regulator of LDLR, SREBP2, is decreased
  in HIV infection; besides this, the regulatory miR-148a-3p is reduced with a concomitant
  increase in target ABCA1. Additionally, the HIV protein Vpr inhibits the PPARγ leading
  to lipotoxicity. Antiviral IFNs upregulate ISGs (CH25H), which converts cholesterol
  to 25HC that inhibits the growth of enveloped HIV by blocking membrane fusion with
  cells, suppresses the HIV replication, and increases the number of T cell and pDCs;
  it also augments the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (ABCA1,
  ABCG1, CYP7B1, LXRa, OSB.P., PPAR-γ, and SCARB1/3). The SNPs rs3135506 and rs662799
  of the APOA5 gene and rs6511720 of the LDLR gene were associated with the development
  of atherogenic dyslipidemia. The T allele of ESR2 and G.G. genotype of MMP1 were
  found to be associated with lipoatrophy.
