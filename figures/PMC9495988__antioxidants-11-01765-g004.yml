caption: 'Effect of DLA on the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The cells were pretreated with DLA (12.5, 25,
  and 50 μM) for 12 h before being exposed to LPS (500 ng/mL) for 1 h. Immunoblot
  analysis was performed to evaluate the protein levels of p-p65 and p65 (A); # p
  < 0.05 vs. vehicle-treated control; ** p < 0.05 vs. treatment with LPS alone. The
  cells were fixed for immunofluorescent labeling for p65. Red represents p65; blue
  represents DAPI staining of the nuclei (B). The protein levels of inhibitor protein
  κBα (IκBα) (C), IκB kinase p-IKKα/β, and IKKα/β (D) were quantified by Western blot;
  # p < 0.05 vs. vehicle-treated control; ** p < 0.05 vs. treatment with LPS alone;
  Cells were treated with 500 ng/mL of LPS and 10 μM MG-132 for 30 min. Following
  cell harvesting, the protein level of IκB was assessed by Western blot analysis,
  and the relative change was determined (E), the cells were pre-treated with 50 μM
  DLA for 12 h and then incubated with 10 μM MG-132 for 1 h; After 30 min of treatment
  with 500 ng/mL of LPS, the proteasome activity in the cell lysates was determined
  (F); # p < 0.05 vs. vehicle-treated control; ** p < 0.05 vs. treatment with LPS
  alone, ns: non-significant vs. treatment with MG-132 alone.'
