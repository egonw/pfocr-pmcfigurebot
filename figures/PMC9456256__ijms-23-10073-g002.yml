caption: 'Excitotoxity-linked mechanisms of acetyl-CoA deficits in cholinergic neuron
  injury. Pyruvate is the final product of the glycolytic pathway and also the main
  precursor of acetyl-CoA generated in neuronal mitochondria by a PDHC-catalysed reaction.
  Pathologic signals associated with AD and other cholinergic encephalopathies, such
  as excessive synthesis/accumulation of Aß, episodes of hypoxia/hypoglycaemia and
  TBI, lead to prolonged depolarisation and excitotoxic stimulation of glutaminergic
  terminals releasing an excess of glutamate and Zn. This causes increased accumulation
  of zinc and calcium ions in postsynaptic neurons, stimulating the synthesis of oxygen
  and nitrosyl free radicals. All these cytotoxic signals directly inhibit PDHC activity.
  As a result, the synthesis and utilisation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle is reduced,
  resulting in inhibition of ATP and NAA synthesis. There is also a reduction in acetyl-CoA
  transport out of mitochondria and the inhibition of hundreds of transacetylation
  reactions in the neuronal cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus (see ). In
  cholinergic neurons, a significant fraction of the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA pool is
  utilised for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter ACh. This process is facilitated
  due to the formation of an ACLY-ChAT complex. However, this additional need for
  acetyl residues makes cholinergic neurons more sensitive to neurotoxic signals than
  neurons of other neurotransmitter systems. TDP deficits increase the permeability
  of neuronal plasma membranes for Zn, Ca and other cytotoxic compounds leading to
  aggravation of their inhibitory effects on the PDHC and other enzymes of acetyl-CoA
  metabolism. The supply of alternative precursors of acetyl-CoA, such as lactate,
  BHB or acetate, may provide additional amounts of this metabolite, bypassing the
  PDHC and glycolytic pathway. Thereby, they may in part overcome deficit of pyruvate-derived
  acetyl-CoA. Moreover, inhibition of acetyl-CoA utilisation for lipid synthesis may
  preserve its pool for key energy-producing pathways. Abbreviations: Enzyme names
