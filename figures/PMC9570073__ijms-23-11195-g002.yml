caption: 'DOW and DLW modulate the expression of AQPs and downregulate MAPKs and NF-κB
  signal transduction on the hyperosmotic HKs model. (A) qRT-PCR for gene expression
  of AQPs of Dendrobium extracts on the hyperosmotic HKs model. * p < 0.05 compared
  to control individually, # p < 0.05 compared to NaCl individually, n = 3. (B) Representative
  bands selected denote the protein expression of AQPs and MMPs of the effect of Dendrobium
  extracts on the hyperosmotic HKs model by Western blot in each group (n = 3). (C)
  Quantitative statistics of protein expression in B. The grey value was obtained
  by Image J software processing. * p < 0.05 compared to control individually, # p
  < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 compared to NaCl treatment group, n = 3. (D) Representative
  bands selected denote the protein expression of MAPKs pathway and NF-κB pathway
  of Dendrobium extracts on the hyperosmotic HKs model by Western blot in each group
  (n = 3). (E) Quantitative statistics of protein expression in D. The grey value
  was obtained by Image J software processing. ** p < 0.01 compared to control individually;
  # p < 0.05 compared to NaCl individually, n = 3.'
