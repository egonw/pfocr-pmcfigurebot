caption: GBAP1 activates BMP/SMAD signaling under the mediation of miR-22-3p in HCC
  cells. A Three bioinformatics tools (TargetScan, mirtarbase and microRNA.org) were
  employed to predict the downstream target candidate of miR-22-3p, and four mRNA
  candidate NOS1, AGPCR, BMPR1A and AKAP95 were obtained. B and C The expression changes
  of four mRNAs in Hep3B-anti-miR-22-3p and MHCC97H-miR-22-3p subclones were tested
  by RT-qPCR. ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). D There existed potential binding site
  between wild type of BMPR1A (BMPR1A -WT) and miR-22-3p, and the mutant type of BMPR1A
  (BMPR1A-MUT) was established. Double luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that
  miR-22-3p was able to negatively regulate the luciferase activity of BMPR1A-WT,
  but had no effect on BMPR1A-MUT. ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). E RT-qPCR analysis
  was performed to analyze BMPR1A expression in HCC tissues (n = 85) and adjacent
  non-tumor tissues (n = 85). ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). F Pearson correlation
  analysis showed that there existed a negative correlation between BMPR1A and miR-22-3p
  in HCC tissues (n = 85). G Pearson correlation analysis showed that there existed
  a positive correlation between GBAP1 and BMPR1A in HCC tissues (n = 85). H and I
  miR-22-3p expression was negatively regulated by GBAP1 alone, while the effect of
  GBAP1 alone on miR-22-3p expression was reversed in GBAP1 + miR-22-3p group and
  shGBAP1#1 + anti-miR-22-3p group. J The KEGG pathway enrichment of GBAP1 based on
  RNA-seq data were analyzed. The top 10 categories were shown. K and L Western blot
  was applied to analyze the expression changes of BMPR1A, p-SMAD1/5 and SMAD1 in
  different co-transfection groups
