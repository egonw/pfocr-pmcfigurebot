caption: GO enrichment analysis of the 30 most abundant DEGs in foxtail millet leaf
  after N and C treatments (A). KEGG enrichment analysis of the 20 most abundant DEGs
  in foxtail millet (B). GeneRatio = number of differentially expressed genes enriched
  in this pathway/number of all differentially expressed genes enriched in the KEGG
  database. The red boxed portion of the KEGG pathway is associated with membrane
  damage.
