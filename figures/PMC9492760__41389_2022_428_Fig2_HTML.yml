figure_title: High HPSE expression level is associated with poor prognosis of BRAF
  V600E-mutant CRC patients
caption: A Representative images of immunohistochemical staining for HPSE. B Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves in HPSE high and low groups of patients with BRAF V600E-mutant CRC.
  A log-rank test was used to calculate the P-value. Shaded regions around the curves
  indicate 95% confidence intervals. The number of patients at risk and censoring
  are presented below the survival curve. C Results of univariate Cox proportional
  hazard model presented as Hazard ratios (blocks in the center) and 95% confidence
  intervals (Whiskers of error bars). D Results of multivariate Cox proportional hazard
  model presented as Hazard ratios (blocks in the center) and 95% confidence intervals
  (Whiskers of error bars). E Results of survival analysis in different subgroups.
  Hazard ratios (blocks in the center) and 95% confidence intervals (Whiskers of error
  bars) were determined by univariate Cox regression. The reference level in each
  subgroup was HPSE low. Kaplan–Meier survival curves in the (F) left location subgroup
  and (G) pMMR subgroup. A log-rank test was used to determine P-value. Shaded regions
  around the curves indicate 95% confidence intervals. The number of patients at risk
  are presented below the survival curve. R survival package, survminer package, and
  forest package were used for survival analysis. HR hazard ratios; CI confidence
  intervals.
