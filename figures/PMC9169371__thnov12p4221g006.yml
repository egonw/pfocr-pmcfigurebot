caption: TGFBI mediates the pro-tumorigenic effect via the integrin αvβ5-Src-Stat3
  axis. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of upregulated genes (fold change ≥ 2.0)
  in the rhTGFBI stimulation group versus the control group (456 GSCs). (B, C) Immunoblot
  analyses of phospho-Src (P-Src-Y527), total Src, phospho-Stat3 (P-Stat3-Y705), total
  Stat3, P53 and CCND1, indicated that rhTGFBI stimulation significantly increased
  Src and Stat3-activating phosphorylation (B), while the knockdown ITGAV treatment
  compromised rhTGFBI-stimulated Src and Stat3 activation in GSCs (C). (D) IF stainings
  of TGFBI and P-Src (upper left), P-Stat3 (upper right), P53 (bottom left), CCND1
  (bottom right) in human GBMs. The scale bars measure 10 µm. Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI (blue). (E) IF stainings of TGFBI and P-Src (upper left), P-Stat3 (upper
  right), P53 (bottom left), CCND1 (bottom right) in GBM xenografts with shNT or shTGFBI.
  Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The scale bars measure 200 µm.
