caption: 'Some of the upregulated pathways in subarachnoid haemorrhage microglia (SMG)
  microglial subset interactions. (A) The amyloid‐β precursor protein (APP) signalling
  pathway was obviously upregulated in post‐SAH microglia. SMG‐C5 (SAM) and SMG‐C6
  are the only targets of the APP signalling pathway. App – Cd74 is the main signalling
  network. (B) The CC‐motif chemokine ligand (CCL) signalling pathway was the most
  upregulated pathway after SAH. Almost all the microglial subsets joined this signalling
  pathway, mainly through Ccl4 and Ccl3 with the Ccr5 signalling network. (C) Secreted
  phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1). D: The GALECTIN signalling pathway. (a, heatmap; b, chord
  map and c, hierarchy connection)'
