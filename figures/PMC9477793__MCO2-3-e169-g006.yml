caption: YAP regulates hBdSMC proliferation through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.
  (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of RNA transcriptome sequencing were identified
  after YAP was knocked down. (B,C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  analysis of cell cycle and DNA replication. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis for downregulated
  DEGs. (E) P‐ERK/ERK and P‐MEK/MEK were detected by western blot after YAP was knocked
  down. Scrambled1 is for KD‐YAP. (F) Quantifications of (E) are the mean ± SEM, n
  = 3, *P < 0.05. (G) YAP was over expressed, and SCH772984 was utilized. The expression
  of P‐ERK/ERK and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) under 32 kPa were detected
  by Western blot. Scrambled2 is for Ad‐Flag‐YAP. (H) Quantifications of expression
  of P‐ERK/ERK (n = 3) and PCNA (n = 4) in (G) are the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01. (I) EdU assay under 32 kPa was performed in rescue experiment, scale bar
  = 200 µm. Scrambled2 is for Ad‐Flag‐YAP. (J) Quantification of (I) is the mean ±
  SEM, n = 5, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001
