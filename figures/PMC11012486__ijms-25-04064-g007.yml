caption: PTPN12 regulates cell proliferation, which is mediated by the Hippo signaling
  pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of YAP and TAZ after the siYAP/siTAZ transfection
  of short interference RNAs targeting YAP/TAZ (siYAP/siTAZ) into MCF10A-gPTPN12 cells.
  (B) Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured in MCF10A-PTPN12-WT
  (−Dox, −siYAP/siTAZ), MCF10A-PTPN12-KO (+Dox, −siYAP/siTAZ), and MCF10A-PTPN12-KO-siYAP/siTAZ
  (+Dox, +siYAP/siTAZ) cells. Cell numbers were counted on days 2, 4, and 6 after
  seeding.
