caption: 'Impairment of the Akt–GSK3–GS pathway in skeletal muscle. No insulin (Control
  and intervention groups with saline): (1) Akt in its deactivated state. (2) No inhibition
  through Akt, hence GSK 3 remains activated. (3) This leads to deactivation of GS
  via phosphorylation. → Catabolism is enabled Control (Control group with insulin):
  (1a) Insulin leads to activation of Akt to phosphorylated Akt. (2a) This causes
  deactivation of GSK3 to pGSK3. (3a) Consequently, GS remains activated. → Anabolism
  is enabled. Immobilisation and Inflammation (Intervention group with insulin): (1b)
  Insulin leads to activation of Akt to pAkt. (2b) GSK3 remains activated as inhibition
  via pAkt is impaired. (3b) This results in deactivation of GS to pGS. → Catabolism
  is enabled'
