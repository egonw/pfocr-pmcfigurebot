figure_title: ADAM15 affects NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in ADAM15-overexpressing
  A549 cell lines and ADAM15-knockdown H1299 cell lines
caption: A ADAM15 mRNA and protein levels were detected in ADAM15-overexpressing A549
  cell lines and ADAM15-knockdown H1299 cell lines. B, C CCK-8 and clonogenic assays
  of cell proliferation in A549 and H1299 cell lines. D A wound healing assay was
  performed to evaluate the effect of ADAM15 in A549 and H1299 cells. E Images of
  the Transwell assay results for cell migration and invasion in A549 and H1299 cells.
  Bars represent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001.
article_title: Integrin α3/α6 and αV are implicated in ADAM15-activated FAK and EGFR
  signalling pathway individually and promote non-small-cell lung cancer progression.
