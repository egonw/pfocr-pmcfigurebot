caption: Cordycepin enhanced radiosensitivity in MA-10 cells. MA-10 cells were treated
  with radiation (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy) combined with different concentrations of cordycepin
  (0, 25 and 50 μM). Cells were plated in 6 cm dishes for 8 days. Dishes were stained
  with crystal violet (A). Colonies containing >50 cells were scored as positive and
  then the radiation dose-response survival curves were determined (B). The data represent
  the mean ± S.D. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 indicate significant statistical
  difference compared to the control group.
