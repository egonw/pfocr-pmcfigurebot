caption: Involvement of dysregulated kinases during HBV infection in various signaling
  pathways (A) KEGG pathway terms associated with kinases deregulated during HBV infection.
  (B) Mapping of kinases with deregulated activities to pathways involved in HBV infection.
  Nodes in red depict kinases with enhance activities, while nodes in yellow are kinases
  with lower activities during HBV infection.
