caption: GALNT1 promotes the growth and metastatic ability of gastric cancer cells
  in vitro. A, GALNT1 expression in gastric cancer cell lines as examined by western
  blot analysis. B-C, Western blot (B) and qPCR (C) analysis depicting the silencing
  efficiency of GALNT1 in MKN45, AGS, and SGC7901 cells as well as the overexpression
  of GALNT1 in AGS cells. D-F, Cells growth ability after GALNT1 knockdown and overexpression
  were determined by CCK8 assay (D) and colony formation assay (E, F). G-I, Knockdown
  of GALNT1 decreased the abilities of migration and invasion of MKN45 and SGC7901
  cells (G, H). Overexpression of GALNT1 enhanced the abilities of migration and invasion
  of AGS cells (I). Data are shown as means ± S.D. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
