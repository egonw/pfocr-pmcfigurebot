caption: GSEA and GSVA. A) GSEA analysis showed that TNF-α signaling via the NF-κB
  signaling pathway was inhibited in IgAN; B) GSEA analysis showed that the apoptosis
  signaling pathway was inhibited in IgAN; C) GSEA analysis showed that the MTORC-1
  signaling pathway was inhibited in IgAN; D) GSVA enrichment analysis of IgAN and
  normal controls
