caption: The combination of trametinib and JQ1 via different cell death modes inhibits
  pancreatic cancer. (A) Cell lysates prepared from PSN-1 cells treated with trametinib
  alone, JQ1 alone, trametinib+JQ1, and trametinib+JQ1+HCQ over a time course were
  analyzed by immunoblotting for p62, LC3, or actin, as indicated. (B) Cell lysates
  prepared from CFPAC-1 cells treated with trametinib alone, JQ1 alone, trametinib+JQ1,
  and trametinib+JQ1+HCQ over a time course were analyzed by immunoblotting for p62,
  LC3, or actin, as indicated. (C) Model of the synergistic effects induced by the
  combination treatment of trametinib and JQ1 in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer.
