caption: 'Reprogramming of glucose metabolism in cancer. Glucose metabolism-related
  enzymes and transporting proteins in cancer: the expression of GLUT1, GLUT2, SGLT,
  HK1, HK2, GPI, PFKFB3, PFKFB4, PFK1, ALDOA, ALDOB, TPI, GAPDH, PGK1, PGAM1, ENO1,
  PKM1, PKM2, LDHA, LDHB, and MCT4 are upregulated in the cancer glycolysis pathway.
  Different molecules affected in tumor cells like KRAS, AKT, c-MYC, LncRNA, HIF-1Î±,
  mTORC-1, and RAS promote, while p53 inhibits the expression of glycolytic proteins
  and enzymes which regulate cancer cell''s glucose metabolism.'
