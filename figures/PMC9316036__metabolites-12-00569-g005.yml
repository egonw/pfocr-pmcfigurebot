caption: Optimization results of minimizing the total flux of ATP-consuming reactions
  of bacterial NAD biosynthetic pathways. (A) A scatter plot showing the abundances
  of Nampt versus PncA when minimizing the ATP consumption required to maintain the
  required NAD steady-state concentration (). Each dot represents an optimisation
  result. The marginal plots show kernel density estimate plots that show the enzyme
  abundance distributions in the optimisation results. (B) Optimized abundance of
  enzymes at different temperatures in PncA pathway. (C) Optimized abundance of enzymes
  from Nampt pathway. (D) The ATP consumption flux, , in PncA (dashed red curve) and
  Nampt (blue curve) pathways at different temperatures. (E) Computed NAD production
  flux, , in PncA and Nampt pathways at different temperatures. (F) Calculated ratio
  of ATP consumption flux to NAD production flux at different temperatures in PncA
  and Nampt pathways.
