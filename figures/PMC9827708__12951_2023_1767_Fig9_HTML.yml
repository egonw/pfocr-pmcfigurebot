caption: EC-EXO promoted nerve regeneration by activating PI3K/AKT/PTEN signaling
  pathways. A The expression levels of biomarkers of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway (PI3K,
  p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT and PTEN) in sciatic nerves in different experimental groups
  were detected by western blot 28 days following the operation. B Statistical analysis
  of western blot results. The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). Representative
  images of PI3K/p-PI3K/GAPDH (C), AKT/p-AKT/GAPDH (E) and PTEN/GAPDH (G) multiple
  fluorescence staining of sciatic nerve at 28 days following the operation. Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI. Scale bar, 20 μm. The statistical results of percentages
  of positive PI3K/p-PI3K/GAPDH staining (D), percentages of positive AKT/p-AKT/GAPDH
  (F) and percentages of positive PTEN/GAPDH staining (H). The data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). ns = not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
