caption: Effect of taurine on the phosphorylation (activation) of ERK1/2. Caco-2 cells
  were cultured in medium containing 100 mM of taurine for 3, 24, and 48 h. The cell
  lysate was recovered and used for the western blot analysis. The bands were quantified
  using an image gauge. Changes in expression are presented as relative values, with
  the expression level in the control at each treatment time as 1.
