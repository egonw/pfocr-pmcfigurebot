figure_title: Hyperactivation of Wnt signaling in Wnt‐low cells does not recapitulate
  Wnt dependency of Wnt‐high cells
caption: 'A(1) Schematic representation of whole‐genome CRISPR screen to compare gene
  essentiality in APCtrunc and APCWT RKO and HCT116 cell lines. Differential gene
  essentiality was assessed by comparing the gRNA abundances at T1 in APCtrunc and
  APCWT cell pools in both RKO and HCT116 backgrounds. The screen was conducted in
  two replicates per cell line. Doubling times for RKO‐APCWT: 23.8 h; RKO‐APCtrunc#5:
  23.9 h; HCT116‐APCWT: 21.0 h; HCT116‐APCtrunc#2: 25.7 h. (2) DepMap data was used
  to assess the differential gene essentially in Wnt‐high (n = 24 cell lines) versus
  Wnt‐low (n = 5 cell lines) CRC cell lines (classification as in Fig ). Created with
  Biorender.com.BDifferential gene essentiality in Wnt‐high versus Wnt‐low CRC cell
  lines displayed as logarithmic fold change (logFC). Negative logFC indicate genes
  that are more essential in Wnt‐high compared to Wnt‐low cell lines. Genes involved
  in Wnt signaling are highlighted in black (MSigDB curated gene set WNT_SIGNALING;
  Liberzon et al, ). Gene set enrichment analysis using the permutation based statistical
  test implemented in the fgsea R package (preprint: Korotkevich et al, ) and Benjamini–Hochberg
  correction for multiple testing indicated a positive enrichment score for absolute
  logarithmic fold changes (P‐value < 0.01) for this pathway. Selected genes of interest
  belonging to this pathway are highlighted and labeled in green.CDependency on CTNNB1
  as a function of AXIN2 expression in Wnt‐high (light gray) and Wnt‐low (dark gray)
  CRC cell lines. The Wilcoxon‐rank sum test indicated that the dependence on CTNNB1
  is different in Wnt high compared to Wnt low cells with a P‐value < 0.01.D, EDifferential
  gene essentiality in APCtrunc versus APCWT HCT116 (D) and RKO (E) cell lines displayed
  as logarithmic fold change (logFC). Negative logFC indicates genes that are more
  essential in APCtrunc compared with APCWT cells. Gene set enrichment analysis using
  the permutation based statistical test implemented in the fgsea R package (preprint:
  Korotkevich et al, ) and Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing indicated
  no significant enrichment for absolute logarithmic fold changes of genes involved
  in Wnt signaling. Gene set definition, color and labeling as in (B).FViability effects
  of single gRNAs targeting CTNNB1. Logarithmic fold changes of gRNA abundance in
  the screening endpoint compared to the plasmid library are displayed for APCtrunc
  (y‐axis) and APCWT (x‐axis) for HCT116 (left panel) and RKO (right panel) cells.
  Red and blue circles indicate results for replicates 1 and 2 of the CRISPR screen.
  Mean fold changes of negative control gRNAs (targeting luciferase) are displayed
  as black circles. Mean fold changes of positive control gRNAs (chromosome 10 promiscuous)
  are displayed as black triangles.'
