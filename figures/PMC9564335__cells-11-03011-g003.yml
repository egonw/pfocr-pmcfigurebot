caption: STING targeting siRNAs and STING specific inhibitor H151 significantly reversed
  cisplatin related immune effects. (A) Knockdown efficiency validation of STING in
  T24 and TCCSUP cell lines. GAPDH was used as control protein. (B) T24 and TCCSUP
  cell lines were treated with non-targeting (Scramble, Scr) or two STING-targeting
  siRNA (si2 and si3) for 48 h before treatment with 2 μg/mL cisplatin for 0 h, 4
  h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, respectively. IFN-β mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were then analyzed
  by qRT-PCR. (C) Western blotting results of key proteins involved in cGAS-STING
  pathway in T24 and TCCSUP cell lines treated with non-targeting (Scramble, Scr)
  or two STING-targeting siRNA (si2 and si3) for 48 h before treatment with 2 μg/mL
  cisplatin for 0 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, respectively. GAPDH was used as control protein.
  (D) T24 and TCCSUP cell lines were co-treated with DMSO or H151 and 2 μg/mL cisplatin
  for 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 20 h, 28 h, respectively. IFN-β mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were
  then analyzed by qRT-PCR. (E) Western blotting results of key proteins involved
  in cGAS-STING pathway T24 and TCCSUP cell lines co-treated with DMSO or H151 and
  2 μg/mL cisplatin for 0 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, respectively. GAPDH was used as control
  protein. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
