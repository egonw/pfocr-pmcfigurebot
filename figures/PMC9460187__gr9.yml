caption: 'Schematic for the proposed mechanisms of PRG-1 modulating RNS-induced hyperalgesia,
  learning, and memory defectsLeft: PRG-1/NSF interactions maintain PRG-1 function
  and neurotransmitter receptor stability under normal conditions. Right: Following
  neonatal RNS stress, the release of extracellular ATP is increased and further inhibits
  PRG-1 function and PRG-1/NSF interaction. Two pathways involving PRG-1 are initiated.
  On one pathway, inhibition of PRG-1 promotes the release of glutamate at the extracellular
  presynaptic membrane. Along the other pathway, PRG-1/NSF interaction interferes
  with the sorting, transport and interaction of neurotransmitter receptors, thus
  causing cell-autonomous AMPAR GluR2 trafficking deficiency, resulting in changes
  in synaptic activity, function, and structure. The two pathways modulate RNS-induced
  persistent hyperalgesia in a synergistic effect.'
