caption: CC domain of CNLs in Solanaceae modulates MED10b/MED7 interaction to activate
  jasmonate-dependent immune pathway. (A) A phylogenetic tree constructed using CNLs
  from various solanaceous species. Sequences of these NLRs were retrieved from the
  GenBank, and the phylogenetic tree was conducted using the neighbor-joining method
  in the MEGA7 package. (B) Y2H assay results showing the interactions between NbMED10b
  and various CC domains of CNLs from different solanaceous species. The transformed
  yeast cells were grown on the SD/-TL and the SD/-TLHA plates, respectively. (C)
  Y2H assay results showing the interactions between NbMED10b and the CC domains in
  the helper NLRs NRC2/3/4. The transformed yeast cells were grown on the SD/-TL and
  the SD/-TLHA plates, respectively. (D) Y3H assay results showing the effects of
  CC domains from different CC-type NLRs on the interaction between NbMED10b and NbMED7.
  Yeast cells coexpressing AD-NbMED7, BD-NbMED10b, Mi-1.2-CC, Rip-blb2-CC, Rx-CC,
  Rpi-vnt1-CC, R3a-CC, or Prf-CC were grown, respectively, on the SD/-TL, SD/-TLHA,
  or SD/-TLHAM medium plates to determine the interaction between NbMED7 and NbMED10b.
  (E) Y3H assay results showing the effects of the CC domains of NRC2a, NRC2b, NRC3,
  and NRC4 on the interaction between NbMED10b and NbMED7. Yeast cells coexpressing
  AD-NbMED7, BD-NbMED10b, Vector, NbNRC2a-CC, NbNRC2b-CC, NbNRC3-CC, or NbNRC4-CC
  were grown on the SD/-TL, SD/-TLHA, or SD/-TLHAM medium plates to determine the
  interaction between NbMED7 and NbMED10b. (F) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis results
  showing the expressions of representative marker genes involved in the JA signaling
  pathways in N. benthamiana coexpressing Rx with EV, PVX with EV, or Rx with PVX.
  The expression levels of NbActin in these samples were used as the internal controls.
  Data are presented as the means ± SE (three independent biological samples per treatment).
  (G) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis results showing the expression of representative
  marker genes involved in the JA signaling pathways in N. benthamiana coexpressing
  Rpi-blb2 with EV, Avr-blb2 with EV, or Rpi-blb2 with Avr-blb2. The expression levels
  of NbActin in these samples were used as the internal controls. Data are presented
  as the means ± SE (three independent biological samples per treatment). (H) Quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis results showing the expressions of representative marker genes involved
  in the JA signaling pathways in N. benthamiana expression of Mi-1.2 or Mi-1.2T557S.
  The expression levels of NbActin in these samples were used as the internal controls.
  Data are presented as the means ± SE (three independent biological samples per treatment).
  (I) The accumulation level of eGFP expressing from PVX in NbMED10b-silenced, NbMED7-silenced,
  or nonsilenced control (TRV-GUS) leaves of N. benthamiana in the infiltrated leaves
  was measured and quantified using the Image J software. Statistical analyses were
  done using the two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are presented as the means ± SE
  (three biological samples per treatment). (J) The size of P. infestans lesions in
  NbMED10b-silenced, NbMED7-silenced, or nonsilenced control leaves of N. benthamiana
  was measured and quantified using the Image J software. Statistical analyses were
  done using the two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are presented as the means ± SE
  (10 biological samples per treatment). (K) The numbers of root knots on NbMED10b-silenced,
  NbMED7-silenced, or nonsilenced control (TRV-GUS) roots of N. benthamiana plants
  and the statistical differences between the treatments were determined using the
  two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are presented as the means ± SE (four biological
  samples per treatment). (L) The numbers of nematode egg masses on the assayed plant
  roots. The statistical differences between the treatments were determined using
  the two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are presented as the means ± SE (four biological
  samples per treatment).
