caption: 'Pyruvate upregulated FGF21 expression in mice in vivo. (A): Intraperitoneal
  injection of pyruvate significantly increased serum pyruvate levels in C57BL/6J
  mice compared with the control (** p < 0.01, n = 10). (B): The pyruvate-treated
  mice had significantly higher FGF21 gene expression in liver than the control (**
  p < 0.01, n = 10). (C): Serum FGF21 levels were not changed by pyruvate treatment
  in mice compared with the control (n = 10). (D): cAMP levels in mouse liver were
  significantly decreased by pyruvate treatment in mice (* p < 0.05, n = 10). (E):
  PDE activity in mouse liver was significantly activated by pyruvate injection in
  mice (* p < 0.05, n = 10). (F): CREB phosphorylation was inhibited in liver after
  pyruvate injection compared with the control. (G,H): ALT and AST activities in mouse
  serum were not significantly different between pyruvate-treated group and the control
  group. (I): H&E staining showed that the liver tissues had normal morphology in
  mice of pyruvate-treated group without obvious difference to the control (bar is
  20 μm).'
