caption: 'Metabolic profiles of samples analysed for key metabolites and enzymes plotted
  as fold of folate levels since this was the only consistent measure between the
  cases. Glutathione is significantly raised in Severe Alzheimer’s with mutant gene
  SNPs for MTHFD1 and MTHFR. This is not seen in any other group, including Alzheimer’s
  without mutant SNPs. In these latter cases, we see significantly raised MTHD1, which
  is not a mutant. In both cases, we see potential protective mechanisms against raised
  homocysteine levels, which are elevated in all cases except normal ageing, although
  none are significant. MTR is also elevated in both affected and control Alzheimer’s
  cases. This is not mutated, so it is also involved in metabolising 5-methyl-THF
  to methylate homocysteine to methionine and thus feeding the methylation pathway.
  Together, the increased glutathione and MTR would act to keep homocysteine levels
  low. Significance is indicated by stars: ** significant at 0.01, *** significant
  at 0.001.'
