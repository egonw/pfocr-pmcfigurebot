caption: 'The interactions of the glyoxalase system with cell energy metabolism, the
  antioxidant system and protein function regulation. MGO formation and elimination
  by the glyoxalase pathway is graphically described as an integral part of cell metabolism.
  The routes by which SDL could contribute to cell energy production, ROS scavenging
  and protein function regulation are highlighted. The hourglass stresses the fact
  that GLO2 activity is the rate-limiting step of the MGO pathway: this could be relevant,
  under certain conditions, such as for an SDL level increase in the cytosol, which
  could favor its utilization in additional paths, such as PTPM and mitochondrial
  GSH pool replenishing (see the text for details). Abbreviations: GR, glutathione
  reductase; cGSH, cytosolic reduced glutathione; mGSH, mitochondrial reduced glutathione;
  GSSG, oxidized glutathione; MGO, methylglyoxal; HTA, hemithioacetal; SDL, S-D-lactoylglutathione;
  GLO1, glyoxalase I; cGLO2, cytosolic glyoxalase II; mGLO2, mitochondrial glyoxalase
  II; D-LAC, D-lactate; D-LDH, D-lactate dehydrogenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  mROS, mitochondrial ROS; cROS, cytosolic ROS; PTPM, post-translational protein modification;
  N-LACT, N-lactoylation; S-GLUT, S-glutathionylation; glycolysis intermediates, cofactors
  and enzymes related to glycolysis are not listed.'
