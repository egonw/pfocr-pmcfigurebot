caption: Transcriptome analyses of NCOA4 deficiency in J774 cells reveal gene responses
  functionally associated with immune system. Transcriptome of control and NCOA4 siRNA-treated
  cells were profiled via RNA-seq. (a) Total of 293 transcript responses were identified
  using |FC| > 1.5 and FDR-adjusted q < 0.05 as thresholds for differential expression
  and significance, respectively (n = 3 biological replicates). Among these, 88 were
  identified upregulated, while 205 genes were downregulated by NCOA4 deficiency.
  (b) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of interferon response
  and hypoxia gene sets by genes with higher expressions in NCOA4 and control siRNA-treated
  cells, respectively. (c) ConsensusPathDB, (d) g:Profiler, and (e) Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis tools commonly present over-representation of genes functionally annotated
  to immune system networks and pathways by NCOA4-responsive genes.
