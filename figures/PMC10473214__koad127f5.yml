caption: Biomolecular condensates play a key role in stress responses. A) The sequestration
  of transcription factors and regulators in condensates can regulate transcription,
  either promoting or inhibiting it. B) Condensates can either increase or decrease
  translation efficiency. C) Due to mass action, concentration of enzymes and substrates
  in the condensates can enhance catalysis or even allow formation of metabolons with
  improved efficiency. D) Condensates can inhibit enzymatic reactions and pathways
  in the dilute phase (e.g. cytosol) by sequestering enzymes, their ligands or substrates
  as well as metabolic intermediates. Inhibition of the reaction can also be achieved
  by separating different components of the common pathway (e.g. enzyme and substrate)
  via sequestration into different types of biomolecular condensates. Created with
