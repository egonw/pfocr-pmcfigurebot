caption: Res-exos transfer the stemness-mediated chemo-resistance by inducing oxidative
  phosphorylation. (A) Enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway by
  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis; (B) Assessment of oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) of recipient cells after treated with either Res-exos or Sen-exos; (C)
  Assessment of cellular ATP levels of recipient cells after treated with either Res-exos
  or Sen-exos; (D) Analysis of the correlation between oxidative phosphorylation score
  and stemness index in TCGA-COAD dataset; (E-I) Assessment of OCR (E), intracellular
  ATP measurement (F), cell viability (G), sphere-formation (H) and stemness marker
  (OCT4 and Nanog) expression in recipient cells after treated with Res-exos with/
  without Gboxin (200 nM). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Numerical data represent
  meanÂ± S.D. based on three independent experiments, and the immunoblots are representative
  of three replicates.
