caption: 'Class II MHC antigen presentation pathway modulation by miRNAs upregulated
  by ICD. (a) miR-4284 (left) and miR-212-3p (right) expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR
  in control (untreated) and RA/IFNα (ICD inducer)-treated cell lines: Mino and DOHH2.
  Expression values were normalized to U6 snRNA levels and referred to control untreated
  samples (dotted line = 1). Statistical analysis (treated vs. untreated cells): one-way
  ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. (b)
  HLA-DR (MHC-II) surface expression was validated by flow cytometry in negative control-transfected
  cells (grey NC) and miR-4284, miR-212-3p or both miRNAs mimic-transfected cells
  (red line miRNA mimic) on Meljuso cells. Representative histograms are shown. (c)
  HLA-DR surface expression values (GeoMean) were normalized to negative control-transfected
  samples (dotted line = 1). Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons test, * p < 0.05; **** p < 0.0001. (d) Class II MHC -associated transcripts
  were evaluated by RT-qPCR in negative control-transfected cells and miR-4284, miR-212-3p
  or both miRNAs mimic-transfected cells on Meljuso cells. Expression values were
  normalized to GAPDH levels and referred to control untreated samples (dotted line
  = 1). Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test,
  * p < 0.05.'
