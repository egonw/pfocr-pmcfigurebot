caption: FleR and FleQ regulate T3SS gene expression via the Gac/Rsm pathway(A) A
  diagram showing the regulatory pattern of T3SS by the Gac/Rsm pathway. RsmA stimulates
  the translation of ExsA and the activity of RsmA is influenced by two small RNAs
  RsmY and RsmZ which sequester RsmA from target mRNAs. Expression of RsmY and RsmZ
  is regulated by a two-component system GacS/GacA which is inversely regulated by
  two additional kinases LadS and RetS.(B) Relative expression of exsA and pcrV in
  the ΔrsmA and ΔrsmAΔfleR strains was measured by RT-qPCR.(C) β-galactosidase activity
  of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in PAO1 WT, ΔfleR, ΔrsmA,
  ΔrsmAΔfleR, and ΔrsmAΔfleR(rsmA) strains.(D) β-galactosidase activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ
  transcriptional fusion was measured in PAO1 WT, ΔfleQ, ΔrsmA, ΔrsmAΔfleQ, and ΔrsmAΔfleQ(rsmA)
  strains. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. ∗, p < 0.05;
  ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001 compared to the indicated group.
