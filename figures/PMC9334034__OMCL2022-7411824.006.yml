caption: Effects of SAA on NETosis and Src/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in ARDS neutrophils.
  (a) Immunofluorescence assay of MPO and Cit-H3 in ARDS neutrophils at 21 h after
  treated with SAA (50 μM) or DEX (1 μM) and stimulated with Src family agonist (10 μM)
  or not (scale bar, 50 μm). (b) The levels of MPO-DNA complexes in the ARDS cells
  supernatant. (c) Protein expression in neutrophils lysate and the relative quantification
  of p-Src/Src, p-Raf/Raf, p-MEK/MEK, and p-ERK/ERK (mean ± SD, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; n =
  3 for normal volunteers and 5 for ARDS patients).
