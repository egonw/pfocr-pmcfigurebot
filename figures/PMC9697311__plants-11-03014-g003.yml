caption: Differential accumulating metabolites for adjacent leaf stages. (A) Volcano
  plots of the identified DMs for adjacent leaf stages, with the red, green, and gray
  dots showing up-DMs, down-DMs, and insignificant DMs, respectively. (B) Top 20 significantly
  enriched KEGG pathways for adjacent leaf stages. The X-axes indicate the “enrich
  factor” represented by the ratio of DMs numbers to total annotated compound numbers
  of each pathway. Y-axes on the left represents KEGG pathways. The area of a circle
  represents the DM number. The KEGG pathways associated with biosynthesis of phenolics
  were highlighted.
