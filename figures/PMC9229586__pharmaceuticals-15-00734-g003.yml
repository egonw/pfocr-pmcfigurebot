caption: Single-gene analysis of HIF1A based on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
  transcriptome data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. (A) Heat map of
  differential genes (top 100; dark red indicates larger logFC values and dark blue
  indicates smaller logFC values. (B) Volcano plot of differential gene analysis.
  Genes with logFC greater than 4 are labeled in the graph. (C) Survival analysis
  of the GSE22762 dataset showing high expression of HIF1A protein (high expression
  defined by median) indicates good prognosis for CLL patients. (D,E) Expression of
  HIF1A and HIF1AN proteins in CLL patients and normal controls. HIF1A protein levels
  were low in CLL patients and high in normal controls, and HIF1AN protein levels
  were high in CLL patients and low in normal controls (Wilcoxon test). (F) Gene ontology
  (GO) analysis of 2000 genes with the greatest difference between EGLN1 knockdown
  and the control group. Positive regulation of cytokine production was enriched in
  biological process in GO analysis. (G) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  analysis of the 2000 genes with the greatest difference between EGLN1 knockdown
  and the control group. The T cell receptor signaling pathway was enriched (*** means
  p â‰¤ 0.001).
