figure_title: TGF-β1 induced the expression of S100A2 to activate the Smad2/3 pathway
caption: A–E Immunoblotting assay revealed that TGF-β1 treatment for various time
  durations (0–24 h) and different concentrations increased the levels of S100A2.
  F, G According to immunofluorescence analyses, TGF-β1 promoted S100A2 expression
  to activate the smad2/3 pathway. Each assay was performed three times. **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001.
article_title: S100A2 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis in
  pancreatic cancer by coordinating transforming growth factor β signaling in SMAD4-dependent
  manner.
