caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the effects and mechanisms of endothelial
  cell (EC) Prkaa1/AMPKα1 deficiency in mice on HFD‐induced metabolic syndrome. Deficiency
  of EC Prkaa1/AMPKα1 protects mice from HFD‐induced endothelial inflammation, macrophage
  infiltration into metabolic organs/tissue, and the development of metabolic syndrome.
  Mechanistically, excess nutrients increase expression and activity of endothelial
  PRKAA1/AMPKα1. The enhanced AMPKα1 up‐regulates EC metabolism including glycolysis
  and FAO, increases acetyl‐CoA production and, consequently, drives the transcription
  of inflammatory molecules via an epigenetic pathway
