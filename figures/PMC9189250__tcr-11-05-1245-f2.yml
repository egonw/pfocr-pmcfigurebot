caption: Functional enrichment analysis of mutation genes in tissue samples and ctDNA
  samples. (A) Cellular component enrichment results of tissue samples; (B) cellular
  component enrichment results of ctDNA samples; (C) biological process enrichment
  results of tissue samples; (D) biological process enrichment results of ctDNA samples;
  (E) molecular function enrichment results of tissue samples; (F) molecular function
  enrichment results of ctDNA samples; (G) KEGG pathway enrichment results of tissue
  samples; (H) KEGG pathway enrichment results of ctDNA samples. The x-axis shows
  the ratio number of genes, and the y-axis shows the pathway terms. The âˆ’log10 value
  of each term is colored according to the legend. ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA; KEGG,
