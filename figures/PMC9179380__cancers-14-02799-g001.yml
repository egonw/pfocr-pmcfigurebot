caption: 'Molecular events involved in regulating T cell subtypes development: (a)
  T cell receptor (TCR) CD4 binds with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII);
  (a.1) Th1 cells being induced in response to the activation of specific intracellular
  INF-ϒ and IL-12 receptor pathways, that are mediated by STAT1 and STAT4, respectively;
  (a.2) Th2 cells are induced in response to mainly IL-2 and IL-4 receptor ligation
  and activation of STAT5 and STAT6 pathways, respectively; (a.3) Th17 cells are induced
  in response to activation of intracellular pathways of IL-6 or IL-21, and TGF-β
  receptors, and their activation mediated through STAT3 pathway for IL-6 or IL-21,
  and SMAD2/3 pathway for TGF-β; (a.4) Th22 cells are induced in response to IL-6
  and TNF-α receptor ligation and activation of STAT3 pathways that lead to induction
  of Th22 master transcription factor AhR (the aryl hydrocarbon receptor); (a.5) Regulatory
  T cells (Treg) are induced in response to the activation of intracellular pathways
  of IL-2 and TGF-β receptors, that are mediated by STAT5 pathway for IL-2 and SMAD2/3
  pathway for TGF-β; (a.6) Th9 cells are induced in response to activation of intracellular
  pathways of IL-4 and TGF-β receptors, that are mediated by STAT6 pathway for IL-4
  and SMAD2/3 pathway for TGF-β; (a.7) T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are induced
  in response to activation of intracellular pathways of IL-6, IL-12, IL-21, and Activin
  A receptors, that are mediated by STAT3 pathway for Interleukins receptors, and
  SMAD2/3 pathway for Activin A receptor; (b) T cell receptor (TCR) CD8 bind with
  major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI); (b.1) Tc1 cells induced in response
  to activation of intracellular pathways of INF-ϒ and IL-12 receptors, that are mediated
  by STAT1 and STAT4, respectively. As a result of STATs pathway activation, they
  lead eventually to induction of master transcription factor ECOMES and T-bet that
  encoded by the Tbx21 gene, production of INF-ϒ, reinforces the Tc1 polarization,
  creating a positive feedback loop, and suppresses the alternative differentiation
  programs; (b.2) Tc2 cells induced in response to mainly IL-2 and IL-4 receptor ligations,
  and activation of STAT5 and STAT6 pathways, respectively. Appropriate STATs signalling
  leads to induction of master transcription factor GATA3, Tc2 polarization, antagonizes
  Tc1 polarization, and cytokines produced includes IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, as well
  as effector molecules, such as granzymes and perforin; (b.3) Tc17 cells are induced
  in response to activation of intracellular pathways of IL-6 or IL-21, and TGF-β
  receptors, that is mediated by STAT3 pathway for IL-6 or IL-21 and SMAD2/3 pathway
  for TGF-β; (b.4) Tc22 cells are induced in response to activation of intracellular
  pathway IL-6 and TNF-α receptors, that are mediated by STAT3 pathway; (b.5) Tc9
  cells are induced in response to activation of intracellular pathways of IL-4 and
  TGF-β receptors, that were mediated by STAT6 pathway for IL-4 and SMAD2/3 pathway
  for TGF-β.'
