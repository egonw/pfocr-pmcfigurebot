caption: PAM-inhibited PC-9 cell migration via ROS. (A) After NAC-pretreated PC-9
  cells, the cells were PAM-incubated for 0, 12, and 48 h and the migration image
  was scratched. (B) Quantification of the scratch migration in PC-9 cells after treatment
  with PAM and incubation for 0 h, 12 h, and 48 h, respectively. (C) Transwell image
  of PC-9 cells before PAM treatment with or without NAC pretreatment. (D) Quantification
  of Transwell results in PC-9 cells with and without NAC pretreatment before PAM
  treatment. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. “ns” means
  no statistical difference. *** p < 0.001 with ANOVA compared with the control.
