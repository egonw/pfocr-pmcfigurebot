caption: Effect of PAM incubation on the migration ability of NSCLC cells. (A) Wound
  healing experiments were conducted to detect the effect of PAM incubation on the
  migration of H460 cells. (B) Quantification of the scratch area of the H460 cells
  after PAM treatment. (C) Wound healing experiments were conducted to detect the
  effects of PC-9 cells incubated with PAM on their migration. (D) Quantification
  of the scratch area of the PC-9 cells after PAM treatment. (E) Transwell cells were
  used to analyze the effect of H460 cells incubated with PAM on their migration capacity.
  (F) The number of H460 cells passing through the Transwell chamber after PAM incubation.
  (G) Transwell cells were used to detect the effect of PAM incubation on PC-9 cell
  migration. (H) The number of PC-9 cells passing through the Transwell chamber after
  PAM incubation. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. “ns”
  means no statistical difference. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,*** p < 0.001 with ANOVA
  compared with the control.
