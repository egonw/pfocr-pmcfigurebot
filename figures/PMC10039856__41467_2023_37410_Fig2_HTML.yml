figure_title: Activation modes of Hallmark pathways in kidney with MAYA
caption: a Heatmap of activity matrix computed on kidney dataset with MSigDB Hallmark
  pathways, initial author annotation is indicated above heatmap. The two activation
  modes of Allograft Rejection are highlighted in bold and further described in the
  subsequent panels, and the four modes of activation of TNFA signaling via NFKB are
  further described in Supplementary Fig. . b Scatterplot of Mode 2 versus Mode 1
  cell activity scores. Associated density histograms are indicated on the sides of
  the graph. c Heatmap of scaled gene expression for top 10 contributing genes for
  Mode1 (top) and Mode2 (bottom) of Allograft Rejection pathway, ordered by decreasing
  contribution for each. d UMAP representation of activity matrix of Hallmark pathways,
  cells are colored according to author annotation, or activity scores of modes 1
  and 2 of Allograft rejection pathway. Specificity score of cell populations is displayed
  next to relevant clusters. e Heatmap of activity scores computed by Pagoda2, AUCell
  and MAYA for Allograft Rejection pathway, cells are grouped according to author
  annotation. f Barplot representation of the detection rate of modes 1 to 3 for the
  pathway Allograft Rejection when adding various numbers of random genes to the pathway
  gene list (n = 100 experiments each). Barplots are colored according to the cell
  population with the highest specificity score for the identified mode. g Jitter
  representation of specificity scores of modes 1 and 2 grouped by level of added
  noise, data points are colored according to author annotation. Specificity obtained
  for each mode with initial gene list is represented with a dashed line.
