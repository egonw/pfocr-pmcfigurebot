caption: Hippo pathway and its targeted inhibitors. Mst1/2 kinase and SAV1 form a
  complex that phosphorylates and activates LATs1/2; Lats1/2 kinase in turn phosphorylates
  and inhibits the transcription coactivators YAP and TAZ; and after dephosphorylation,
  YAP/TAZ is transferred to the cell nucleus and activates transcription factors such
  as TEAD1-4, thereby inducing and promoting cell proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis.
  The red text represents the targeted inhibitor for this target.
