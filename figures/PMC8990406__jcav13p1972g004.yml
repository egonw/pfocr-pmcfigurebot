caption: mRNA-seq assay was performed to validate differentially expressed genes and
  signaling pathway. (A) Identification of genes regulated by METTL3 in ESCC using
  mRNA-Seq assay. (B-C) GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted possible biological
  processes and signaling pathways mediated by target mRNAs. (D) GO biological process
  enrichment analysis of 23 mRNAs involving in MAPK signaling pathway. (E) Heat map
  of top 30 differentially expressed genes in KYSE150 cells silenced with METTL3.
  (F) 11 of 30 significantly differentially expressed genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR.
  (G) Relative level of MAP2K1 was assessed by qRT-PCR in ESCC cell lines with knockdown
  or overexpression of METTL3. Data are expressed as the mean Â± SD. **P<0.01. (H-I)
  The expression of COL12A1 and phosphorylation status of RAF/MEK/ERK pathway when
  ESCC cells were transfected with siMETTL3 or oeMETTL3 plasmids was investigated
  by western blot.
