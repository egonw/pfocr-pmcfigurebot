caption: 'Effect of Cacumen Platycladi and quercetin on the NLRP3 signaling pathway
  in the mouse gut. (a) TLR4, NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD protein expression
  in the gut measured by western blot. (b) IL-18, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α protein expressions
  measured by western blot; TNF-α and IL-6 protein expressions in the gut measured
  by ELISA. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P <
  0.001 versus LPS group. ##P < 0.01 versus control group.'
article_title: Quercetin effectively improves LPS-induced intestinal inflammation,
  pyroptosis, and disruption of the barrier function through the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3
  signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.
