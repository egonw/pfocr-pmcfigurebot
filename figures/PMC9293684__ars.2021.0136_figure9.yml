caption: Possibilities of BH4 involvement in ferroptosis. This Figure is shown in
  the gray highlighted area of . At the time of this review, there are more questions
  than answers as many different pathways leading to oxidant, LOOH, and CoQ10 levels
  are possible. Most studies have focused on GTPCH-I manipulation of BH4, and the
  role of other biosynthetic, recycling, or salvage pathway enzymes that maintain
  BH4 is unknown. GTPCH-I, GTP cyclohydrolase I.
