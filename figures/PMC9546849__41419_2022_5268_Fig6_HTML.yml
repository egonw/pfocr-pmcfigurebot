caption: WTAP regulates the differential expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes at the non-posttranscriptional level. WTAP induces the expression of Muc1,
  which regulates EGFR activity in cholangiocarcinoma. Hsp90 forms a complex with
  WTAP and stabilizes its protein level to promote chemoresistance in AML. In DLBCL,
  Hsp90 also stabilizes the WTAP protein, which forms a complex with BCL6. In colorectal
  cancer, CA4 interacts with WTAP and promotes its degradation in a polyubiquitination-dependent
  manner so that WT1 is released from the WT1-WTAP complex, resulting in the induction
  of transducin β-like protein 1 (TBL1) and the degradation of β-catenin, which blocks
  the Wnt pathway. WTAP was found to facilitate the nuclear translocation of β-catenin
  and enhance the phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser9, which induced chemoresistance
  to cisplatin in endometrial carcinoma by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Additionally,
  WTAP was found to regulate the expression of the EMT-related proteins E-cadherin
  and vimentin. Furthermore, WTAP is involved in the activation of the AKT and MAPK
  pathways. Overall, WTAP contributes to cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion,
  metastasis, and chemo- or radioresistance in different cancers.
