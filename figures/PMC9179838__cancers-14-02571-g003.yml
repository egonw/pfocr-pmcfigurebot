caption: Effects of the centroid gene set and scaling method on intrinsic subtyping.
  (A) Distribution of intrinsic subtypes among gene sets using different scaling methods.
  (B) Robustness of intrinsic subtypes using either different gene sets or scaling
  methods. When using different parameters, samples with identical intrinsic subtype
  assignments are labeled ‘identical’. Samples with completely different intrinsic
  subtype assignments are labeled ‘different’. Sample with only 2 different intrinsic
  subtype assignments using 3 different gene sets are labeled ‘partial’. (C) Circos
  plot of 3 intrinsic gene sets. The purple line links identical genes and the blue
  line denotes functional correlations. (D) GO pathway enrichment visualized with
  heatmap. A lower p value with a deeper color suggests more genes are enriched in
  the pathway.
