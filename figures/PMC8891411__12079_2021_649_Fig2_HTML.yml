caption: BMP4 activates SMAD-dependent pathway in breast cancer cells. a Phospho SMAD1/8
  (pSMAD1/8), b phospho SMAD 2/3 (pSMAD2/3) expression in MCF7, MDA-MB-231 cells were
  analyzed by phospho flow cytometry after treatment with BMP4 (10ng/ml) or LDN (1µM).
  Values are represented as mean (Geometric mean) fluorescence intensity (MFI). c
  Immunoblotting analysis of pSMAD1/5, pERK1/2, and RHOA expression in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231
  after treatment with BMP4, LDN, or BMP4 + LDN (B + L). d-f Control (CON), BMP4,
  or LDN treated cells were analyzed for the expression of proliferation, self-renewal,
  and EMT genes by real-time PCR. d Graph showing fold changes in BMP pathway genes
  in MCF7, e MDA-MB-231 cells. f Heatmap showing fold changes in gene expression in
  MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In all the graphs shown, CON represents untreated control.
  Values are mean ± SE, n = 3–4 independent samples, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005
