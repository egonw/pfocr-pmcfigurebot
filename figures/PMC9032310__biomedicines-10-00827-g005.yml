caption: BFT induced MAPK activation does not require β-catenin. (A) Western blot
  analysis of MAPK signaling molecules. Wild type HT29/C1 cells were pre-incubated
  with serum free media for 12 h. Then cells were incubated with rET or rNT for the
  indicated time period (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 180, or 360 min). Cell lysates
  were subjected to Western blotting to quantify MAPK signaling molecules (p38, p-p38,
  ERK and p-ERK). GAPDH was used as an internal control. (B) Western blot analysis
  of MAPK proteins in BFT treated WT, KO#1, and KO#2 cells. WT, KO#1, and KO#2 cells
  were incubated with rET or rNT for 40 min. Cell lysates were subjected to Western
  blotting to evaluate MAPK signaling molecules. GAPDH was used as an internal control.
  (C) IL-8 ELISA. WT, KO#1, and KO#2 cells were incubated with rET or rNT for 24 h.
  Cell supernatants were analyzed through IL-8 ELISA. The samples were analyzed by
  triplicate and depicted as the mean. Error bars, SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  (unpaired t-test).
