caption: The qRT-PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The gray pillars
  show the RNA-Seq expression analysis while the black pillars demonstrate the qRT-PCR
  expression profile. The green-head DEGs were enriched in abscisic acid (ABA) signal
  transduction pathway, the yellow-head DEGs were enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism
  pathway, while the blue-head DEGs were enriched in phenypropanoid biosynthesis pathway.
  The log2|Foldchange (CK vs. D)| value of more than 1 was used to denote differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs).
