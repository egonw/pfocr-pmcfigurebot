caption: 'Expression of PLCE1 in OS tissue microarray. (A) General view of immunohistochemical
  results of OS tissue chip (F01–F09 are normal bone tissues and A01–E09 are OS tissues).
  (B) The image analysis system analyzes the intensity of the immunohistochemical
  positive area (**p<0.01). (C and D) Immunohistochemical results of OS tissue and
  the corresponding image system analysis display (B–immunohistochemical stains; C–derived
  from system analysis display). (E and F) Immunohistochemical results of normal bone
  tissue and the corresponding image system analysis display (D–immunohistochemical
  stains; E–derived from system analysis display). PLCE1: Phospholipase C epsilon
  1; OS: Osteosarcoma.'
article_title: PLCE1 is a poor prognostic marker and may promote immune escape from
  osteosarcoma by the CD70-CD27 signaling pathway.
