caption: Effects of cordycepin and CHIR99021 on cyclin D1 and β-catenin protein expressions.
  A, B. Cyclin D1 and β-catenin protein expressions of HT-29 and LoVo cells were detected
  by Western blot after co-treatment with 80 μM cordycepin and 10 μM CHIR99021. All
  experiments were repeated at least 3 times and were performed in triplicates, and
  data were presented as mean ± SD. ***; P<0.001.
