caption: 15-LOX pathway. (A). Linoleic acid C18:2n-6 can be converted by 15-LOX-1
  and 15-LOX-2 into 13-HpODE. This compound can then be converted into 13-HODE and
  13-oxo-ODE. (B) 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 can convert ARA C20:4n-6 into 15-HpETE. 15-LOX-1
  can also convert this fatty acid into 12-HpETE. 15-HpETE can then be converted into
  EXA4 and into cysteinyl-eoxins EXC4, EXD4, and EXE4. 15-HpETE can also be converted
  into hepoxilins 14,15-HxA3 11S, and 14,15-HxB3 13R. 14,15-HxA3 11S can be converted
  to cysteinyl hepoxilins, such as 14,15-HxA3-C 11S.
