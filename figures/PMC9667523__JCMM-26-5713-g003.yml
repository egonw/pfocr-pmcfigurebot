caption: Combination of proteomics and phosphorylated proteomics analysis. (A) and
  (B) A total of 6883 differentially expressed proteins in Multiple omics analysis
  in CLP + H2 mice vs. CLP mice and the 268 correlated proteins were differentially
  expressed only in phosphoproteins. (C) Volcano plot and (D) hierarchical clustering
  showing the distribution of the significance and fold change of identified phosphoproteins
  between CLP + H2 mice and CLP mice. All data points are plotted in log2 (fold change)
  on the x‐axis and −log10 (p‐value) on the y‐axis.
