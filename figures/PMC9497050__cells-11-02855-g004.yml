caption: 'MYH9 induces the pan-MAPK signaling pathway. (A) MYH9 silencing had no influence
  on the PI3K-PDK1/Akt and GSK3Î² pathway in OECM-1 cells. After transfection of the
  MYH9-shRNA (sh-M) or the vector (Vt) plasmid into OECM-1 cells, cellular proteins
  were extracted and subjected to western blot analysis for pGSK3b, pPDK1, pAkt (S473),
  pAkt (T308), and total Akt protein expressions. (B). MYH9 silencing inhibits the
  phosphorylated status of MAPK signaling molecules. After transfection of the MYH9-shRNA
  (sh-M) or the vector (Vt) plasmid into OECM-1 cells, cellular proteins were extracted
  and subjected to western blot analysis for phosphorylated and total levels of Erk/p38/JNK.
  (C) Activators of Erk and p38/Jun activate ROS scavenger enzymes (GCLC/GCLM). After
  treatment of the Erk activator (Ceramide C6) or p38/JNK (Anisomycin) in OECM-1 cells,
  the phosphorylated status of Erk/p38/JNK and ROS scavenger enzymes, GCLC, GCLM,
  and GPX2 were determined by western blot analysis. (D) The effect of GCLC/GCLM by
  shMYH9 was abolished upon MAPK activation. After treatment of Erk activator (Ceramide
  C6) or p38/JNK (Anisomycin) in the vector control or shMYH9 silencing cells, the
  protein GCLC and GCLM were determined by western blot analysis. (E) Significantly
  higher expressions of MAPK1 and MAPK8 in HNC tumor samples compared to the normal
  samples. Correlative expressions between MYH9 and MAPK1 or MAPK8 in the HNC tumor
  samples. The gene expression data were retrieved from the TCGA-HNSC dataset. The
  GAPDH level was used as an internal control. All the experiments were performed
  at least three times independently, and a typical result was shown. The error bars
  shown in the relevant figures indicated the standard deviation of the quantification
  results in all experiments. (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, ns: no significance,
  t-test).'
