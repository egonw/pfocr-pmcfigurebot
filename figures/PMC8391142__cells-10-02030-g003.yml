caption: The HH pathway crosstalks with other signaling pathways in gastrointestinal
  cancers. The crosstalking of the canonical and non-canonical HH pathways with other
  pathways in drug resistance of gastrointestinal cancers are summarized. In gastrointestinal
  cancers, HO-1, ATK–mTOR, and EIF5A can activate the canonical HH pathway, while
  TET1 and CHL1 inhibit the canonical HH pathway. STAT3, MAP3K10, AKT, and BRD4 may
  activate the non-canonical HH pathway. Chemotherapy activates the HH pathway through
  different mechanisms. The active HH signaling increases expression of SOX2 and ABC
  transporters, promotes EMT, and induces drug resistance. Hedgehog (HH); heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 5A (EIF5A); signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3); mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 10 (MAP3K10); bromodomain-containing protein 4(BRD4); ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transports; epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).
