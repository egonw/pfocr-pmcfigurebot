caption: 'Effect of MYR on the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) mRNAs in rats hippocampal with SPS-induced
  depression- and anxiety-like behaviors (a). The relative intensities of polymerase
  chain reaction amplification product bands on agarose gels are shown. The expression
  levels of BDNF and TrkB mRNAs were normalized to the expression level of glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA as an internal control. Activation of phosphor-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) in the hippocampus after MYR treatment (b). Western
  blot analysis of protein expression levels of p-ERK. ∗p<0.05 and ∗∗p<0.01 vs. SAL
  group; #p<0.05 vs. SPS group.'
