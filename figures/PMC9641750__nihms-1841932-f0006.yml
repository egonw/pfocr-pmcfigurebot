caption: ACE2 signaling pathway. ACE2 metabolizes the conversion of angiotensin peptide
  Ang II to Ang (1–7). This both reduces the amount of Ang II available to bind the
  AT1R and increases signaling of Ang (1–7) through AT2R and MasR. Diminazene aceturate
  (DIZE) treatment increased ACE2 activity and increases AT2R and MasR transcription.
  We hypothesize this mechanism promoted the observed increase in survival by suppressing
  pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling cascades.
