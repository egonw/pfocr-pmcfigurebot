caption: 'Schematic illustration of a multifunctional indocyanine green (ICG)/Cu-layered
  double hydroxide (LDH)@BSA–doxorubicin (DOX) nanomedicine. (a) Hybrid LDH nanoparticles
  constructed by making Cu-LDH, loading ICG, and then coating with BSA/BSA–DOX. (b)
  Mice bearing B16F0 tumors are intravenously injected with ICG/Cu-LDH@BSA–DOX and
  exposed to 808-nm laser irradiation (0.3 W cm−2 for 2 min) after 24 h injection,
  at considerably lower doses (DOX: 0.175 mg kg−1, Cu: 0.5 mg kg−1, and ICG: 0.25
  mg kg−1) than those usually used. (c) BSA/BSA–DOX-coated ICG/Cu-LDH nanoparticles
  efficiently accumulate in the tumor site via the EPR effect and facilitate the uptake
  of tumor cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. In the late endosome,
  LDH nanoparticles that were neutralized with pumped-in H+ ions led to an increased
  number of Mg2+, Al3+, and Cl– ions. An increase in the ionic strength within the
  endosome drove the water molecules into the endosome, resulting in the osmotic swelling
  of the endosome and the eventual release of the residual LDH nanoparticles into
  the cytoplasm. Once internalized by B16F10 cancer cells, ICG/Cu-LDH@BSA–DOX releases
  therapeutic DOX in response to an acidic environment (pH 5.0–6.5), which synergizes
  with near-infrared irradiation-induced photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy
  (PDT) to enable tumor apoptosis. (d) The mechanism of pH-triggered DOX release involves
  amide bond cleavage under a mildly acidic microenvironment of tumor tissues and
  cells.(Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. []. 2021, American Chemical Society).'
