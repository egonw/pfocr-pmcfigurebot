caption: The PPARγ-KMT2D complex is a key regulator of PCa lipid metabolism. (A) Prostate
  cancer cases with PPARγ mutation and KMT2D mutation showed significant non-overlap
  and “mutually exclusive” phenomenon. Mutually exclusive tumor driver genes usually
  have the same pathway. (B) Co-IP assay of the interaction between KMT2D and PPARγ
  in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated using the KMT2D
  antibody. (C) The PPRE motif of the fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene promoter region
  was predicted using Multiple EM for motif Elicitation (MEME). (D) DNA binding of
  KMT2D and PPARγ on the PPRE analyzed using the DNA pull-down assay. Western blotting
  with anti-KMT2D or anti-PPARγ antibody. (E) PPARγ is its own target gene. After
  KMT2D knockdown, the PPARγ gene transcription level in PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP cells
  decreased. (F) The ProteinSimple analysis (also known as Wes) was used to analyze
  the protein expression levels of PPARγ in PC-3. Representative images of an immune
  blot (left panel), the target protein peak intensities (area under the curve; middle
  panel), and densitometric quantification of PPARγ expression (right panel) are shown.
  The above results indicate that there was a decrease in the protein level of PPARγ
  after the knockdown of KMT2D. The experiments (D,E) were repeated thrice with biological
  replicates. Errors are expressed as standard deviation (SD). *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
