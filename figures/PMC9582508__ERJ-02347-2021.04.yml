caption: 'Pirfenidone leads to decreased vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin expression
  in the lungs of Fra-2-overexpressing transgenic (Fra-2 TG) mice. a) Schematic of
  the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway “Leukocyte transendothelial
  migration”. The log fold change of gene expression is indicated by colour, significance
  of regulation is indicated by box borders. b) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
  of VE-cadherin (Cdh5). Data are presented as boxplots with dot-plot overlays. Statistical
  analysis was performed using nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis testing with post-analysis
  to compare specific groups. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, ***: p<0.001. c) Low- and high-magnification
  immunofluorescence images of VE-cadherin (Cdh5) and von Willebrand factor (Vwf)
  staining in lung tissue from wild-type (WT) and Fra-2 TG mice with (+P) and without
  pirfenidone treatment. Nuclear counterstain was performed using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI). Scale bars=10 µm. d) Spearman''s rank correlation analysis of inflammatory
  cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL cell count) and Cdh5 expression.'
