figure_title: Using the connectivity search webapp to explore the pathophysiology
  of Alzheimer’s disease
caption: This figure shows an example user workflow for https://het.io/search/.A.
  The user selects two nodes. Here, the user is interested in Alzheimer’s disease,
  so selects this as the source node. The user limits the target node search to metanodes
  relating to gene function. The target node search box suggests nodes, sorted by
  the number of significant metapaths. When the user types in the target node box,
  the matches reorder based on search word similarity. Here, the user becomes interested
  in how the circadian rhythm might relate to Alzheimer’s disease.B. The webapp returns
  metapaths between Alzheimer’s disease and the circadian rhythm pathway. The user
  unchecks “precomputed only” to compute results for all metapaths with length ≤ 3,
  not just those that surpass the database inclusion threshold. The user sorts by
  adjusted p-value and selects 7 of the top 10 metapaths.C. Paths for the selected
  metapaths are ordered by their path score. The user selects 8 paths (1 from a subsequent
  page of results) to show in the graph visualization and highlights a single path
  involving ARNT2 for emphasis.D. A subgraph displays the previously selected paths.
  The user improves on the automated layout by repositioning nodes. Clicking an edge
  displays its properties, informing the user that association between Creutzfeldt-Jakob
  disease and NPAS2 was detected by GWAS.
