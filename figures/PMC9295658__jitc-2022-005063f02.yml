caption: Tumor cell-derived CCL2 decreased the M1-like phenotype of TAMs by via inhibiting
  NF-κB signaling, therefore eliciting trastuzumab resistance. (A, B) the NCI-N87
  and Kato III cell lines were stably transfected with control vector or CCL2 overexpressing
  plasmid. The expression of CCL2 was detected by PCR (A) and Western blotting (B).
  (C, D) the stable control (vector +TAM group) and CCL2 overexpressing (overexpressed
  CCL2 +TAM group) NCI-N87 and Kato III cells were cocultured with TAMs at a ratio
  10:1. then, the stable CCL2 overexpressing NCI-N87 and Kato cells cocultured with
  TAMs, were incubated with CCX140-B to blocked CCL2-CCR2 signaling (overexpressed
  CCL2 +TAM+CCX140-B group). The mixed cells were incubated with the 50 µg/mL trastuzumab
  and CCK8 assay was performed to evaluate the drug sensitivity (C). The mixed cells
  were treated with the trastuzumab at gradient concentrations of from 0 to 1000 µg/mL
  and CCK8 assay was applied to measure the IC50 (D) (n=4). (E–H) TAMs were cocultured
  with the stable control (vector group) and CCL2 overexpressing (overexpressed CCL2
  group) gastric cancer cells in a non-contact coculture Transwell system. Then, the
  non-contact coculture system of CCL2 overexpressing gastric cancer cells and TAMs
  were treated with CCX140-B to blocked CCL2-CCR2 signaling (overexpressed CCL2 +CCX140
  B group). EdU assay (E) was performed to present the live tumor cells under the
  treatment with 50 µg/mL trastuzumab (n=3). qPCR (F) and flow cytometry (G) were
  performed to analyze the polariton phenotype of TAMs (n=3) and Western blotting
  (H) was performed to analyze the NF-κB signaling pathway. (I, J) TAMs were cocultured
  with the stable control (vector group) and CCL2 overexpressing gastric cancer cells
  in a non-contact coculture Transwell system. then, IMD 0354 (IMD, 2 µM) was adopted
  to block the NF-κB signaling in the TAMs, which were cocultured with stable control
  (vector +IMD group) or CCL2 overexpressing (overexpressed CCL2 +IMD) gastric cancer
  cells. The flow cytometry (I) was performed to analyze the polariton phenotype of
  TAMs (n=3), and Western blotting (J) was performed to analyze the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Results were shown as mean±SD. IMD (IMD 0354, an inhibitor of IKKβ). *P<0.05,
