caption: PI3K-Akt pathway was enriched by CSP100 PLUS Microarray. (A) Histogram showed
  the relative fold changes of the differentially expressed proteins when treated
  with GDF11. The dotted lines were set at Â±1.2 and considered as the differentially
  expressed proteins. (B) The core signal-net were conducted by Ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA). (C) The key pathway cross-talk analysis was performed by IPA.
