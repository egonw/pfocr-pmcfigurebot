caption: 'The pentose phosphate pathway and its interrelation with glycolysis. Blue
  and orange arrows show reversible and irreversible reactions, respectively. Enzyme
  names are shown in blue and orange boxes. Glycolysis metabolites obtained through
  the PPP are shown in red squares. G6P—glucose 6-phosphate; F6P—fructose 6-phosphate;
  F1,6P—fructose 1,6-biphosphate; DHAP—dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P—glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; 1,3 BPG—1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3PG—3-phosphoglycerate; 2PG—2-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP—phosphoenolpyruvate; 6PG—6-phosphogluconate; HK—hexokinase; PGI—phosphoglucoisomerase;
  PFK—phosphofructokinase; FBA—fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; TPI—triose-phosphate
  isomerase; GAPDH—glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK—phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PGM—phosphoglycerate mutase; G6PD—glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD—6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase; RPE—ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase; RPI—ribose-5-phosphate isomerase;
  TKL—transketolase; TAL: transaldolase.'
