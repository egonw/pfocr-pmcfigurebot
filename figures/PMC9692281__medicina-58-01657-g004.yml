caption: Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis of the different PPI networks. (A)
  Top 10 KEGG pathways of the expanded network based on the identified PPI network
  for the mutated proteins (PKD1, PKD2, TSC2, and BRSK2). Terms are ordered based
  on significance (p-value). (B) Top 10 KEGG pathways of the expanded network based
  on the first neighbors of BRSK2 derived from the main PPI network. Terms are ordered
  based on significance (p-value).
