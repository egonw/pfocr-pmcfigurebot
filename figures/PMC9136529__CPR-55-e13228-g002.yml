caption: Wnt/β‐catenin pathway was involved in cell proliferation inhibition. (A)
  The expression or phosphorylation of key proteins in MAPK signalling pathway under
  treatment with lithocholic acid (LCA) (60–180 μM) treatment for 24 h. (B) Heat map
  of 33 DEGs related to Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway based on the limitation of
  log2|fold change| >1 and padj ≤0.05. (C) The expression or phosphorylation of key
  proteins in Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway under treatment with LCA (60–180 μM)
  treatment for 24 h. (D) Immunofluorescence staining of β‐catenin (red) under treatment
  with LCA (80, 120 and 160 μM) for 24 h (×400). Cells were counterstained with DAPI
  (blue). (E,F) The expression or phosphorylation in Wnt/β‐catenin or MAPK signalling
  pathways under treatment with different does of LCA, DCA and CA for 24 h, respectively
article_title: The inhibition of enterocyte proliferation by lithocholic acid exacerbates
  necrotizing enterocolitis through downregulating the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway.
