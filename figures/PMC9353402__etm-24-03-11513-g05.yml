caption: Histological and immunohistological analyses. (A, D, G and J) HE staining
  shows the inflammatory response of the cardiomyopathy in rats and myocardial necrosis.
  The myocardial tissue of (A) the N group showed that the morphology of myocardial
  cells was complete and the boundaries were clear. The (D) LINS groups and (G) LIIL
  groups saw a large number of inflammatory cells in particular infiltrate the infarcted
  area, accompanied by removal of disrupted ventricular tissue. These pathological
  phenomena were significantly reduced in the (J) LIILR group, and local vascular
  reactivation and residual heart muscle could be observed. Representative images
  of immunohistochemical staining of IL-6 (brown blots) in heart tissues of rat at
  2 weeks are shown as (B), (E), (H) and (K), respectively. The number of positive
  expression particles in the LIIL group was the largest, followed by the LINS group
  and the LIILR, where they were significantly reduced, and the N group, where it
  was rare. TGFβ1 immunized dyeing in myocardial tissue was sepia particles, mainly
  distributed in the infarction region, the number of positive expression particles
  was the largest in the (I) LIIL group, followed by the (F) LINS group, (L) LIILR
  group significantly reduced and the (C) N group was rare. HE, hematoxylin and eosin;
  IHC, immunohistochemistry; N group, normal control group; LINS group, LAD ligation
  with an injection of normal saline group; LIIL group, LAD ligation with an injection
  of IL-6 recombinant protein group; LIILR group, LAD ligation with injection of IL-6
  receptor inhibitor group.
