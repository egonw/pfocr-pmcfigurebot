caption: 'OR2H2 activation triggers the CaMKKß–AMPK–mTORC1 signaling pathway in VK2/E6E7
  cells: (A) Immunoblot results for phospho-CaMKK-ß, CaMKK-ß, and p-CaMKK-ß/CaMKK-ß
  ratio; (B) phospho-AMPK, AMPK, and p-AMPK/AMPK ratio; (C) phospho-mTORC1, mTORC1,
  and p-mTORC1/mTORC1 ratio; (D) phospho-S6K, S6K, and p-S6K/S6K ratio; (E) phospho-S6,
  S6, and p-S6/S6 ratio. Tests were conducted in triplicate. Ctrl denotes control
  (0.1% ethanol); A769662 (AMPK agonist), 100 µM; Ald 13-13 refers to aldehyde 13-13
  at 500 µM; Rapa (rapamycin) is at 100 nM. Data are displayed as mean ± SD. Two-tailed
  unpaired t-test was used for multiple or two-group comparisons. *, p < 0.05; **,
  p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.'
