caption: The antiviral activity of IFN-γ against FMDV was recovered by KPNA1 overexpression.
  A PK-15 ​cells infected with FMDV O/BY/CHA/2010 ​at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 ​h were
  transfected with 0 ​μg, 0.25 ​μg, 0.5 ​μg or 0.75 ​μg of pXJ41-FLAG-KPNA1. Empty
  vector pXJ41 was used to ensure that the total amount of transfected plasmid DNA
  in each group was 0.75 ​μg. At 24 ​h after infection, cells were treated with 400 ​ng/mL
  porcine IFN-γ. 5 h later, TCID50 was determined on BHK-21 ​cells. Data represent
  the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars) of three experiments. B Expression
  of KPNA1 (top panel) or FMDV 3Cpro (middle panel) in PK-15 ​cells detected by Western
  blotting using antibody against FLAG or rabbit 3C serum, with β-actin as a loading
  control (bottom panel). C Densitometric analysis of the digital image of FMDV 3Cpro.
  The band intensities normalized with β-actin were suggested as relative protein
  expression. Data represent the mean ​± ​the standard deviations (error bars) of
  three experiments. ∗, P ​< ​0.05.
