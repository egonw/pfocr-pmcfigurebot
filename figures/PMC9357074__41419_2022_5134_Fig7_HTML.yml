figure_title: Knockdown of CAV-1 inhibited autophagy-related signaling pathways in
  BMDMs
caption: A GSEA analysis of NF-κB signaling pathway in ALI samples. B Western blotting
  analysis of CAV-1, p-IκBα, IκBα, p-NF-κBp65, and NF-κBp65 protein levels in BMDMs.
  C–E Quantification of these protein bands. F Confocal laser immunofluorescence showed
  NF-κBp65 nuclear translocation in BMDMs from different groups (magnification ×63).
  G GSEA analysis of mTOR signaling pathway in ALI sample. H, L The expression of
  p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-AMPK, and AMPK were detected by western blotting in
  BMDMs. I, J, M Quantification of these protein bands. K GSEA analysis of AMPK signaling
  pathway in ALI samples. Results were represented as mean ± SEM (n = 4, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
