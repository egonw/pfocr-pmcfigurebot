caption: Expression of SIRT1, p53, p21, E2F1 and FoxO proteins, as well as cleaved
  caspase 3, in 67NR and 4TLM primary tumors. (a) Representative images showing the
  expression of SIRT1, p53, p21 and E2F1 in 67NR and 4TLM primary tumors. Arrows represent
  target protein expression for each protein, and the arrowhead represents perinuclear
  E2F1 expression in 4TLM. Scale bar represents 50 μm. (b) Graphs demonstrate the
  results of Image J analysis for each protein in primary tumor tissues (* p ˂ 0.05).
  (c) Representative images showing FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4 and cleaved caspase 3 protein
  expression in 67NR and 4TLM primary tumors. Arrows represent target protein expression
  for each protein, and the arrowhead represents nuclear cleaved caspase3 expression
  in 4TLM. Scale bar represents 50 μm. (d) Graphs demonstrate results of Image J analysis
  for each protein in primary tumors (* p ˂ 0.05). (e) The graph represents mRNA levels
  of SIRT1, FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO4.
