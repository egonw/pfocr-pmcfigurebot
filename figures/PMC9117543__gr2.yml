caption: RNA-Seq analysis of old and iron-overload mice.A, distribution of the KEGG
  pathways at level 2 in the livers of old mice and iron-overload mice induced by
  iron dextran, respectively. The bar chart showed the numbers of sequences within
  different pathway categories. CK, control group; HI, iron overload group; OLD, old
  group (n = 3). B, Venn diagram illustrating the extent of overlap among the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) observed in each group. The 450 genes regulated in the iron-overload
  mice significantly overlapped with the same genes in old mice (upper). Venn diagram
  for upregulated genes or downregulated genes among the overlapped 450 genes was
  shown (down). C, heatmap representation of 450 overlapping genes in old and iron-overload
  mice. D, KEGG significant enrichment analysis for the aging pathway. Top 20 most
  significantly altered pathways in aging pathway mapped with downregulated DEGs and
  upregulated DEGs in HI group compared with CK group (left). Top 20 most significantly
  altered pathways in aging pathway mapped with downregulated DEGs and upregulated
  DEGs in OLD group compared to CK group (right). Red bars indicated the same changed
  pathways related to oxidative stress between HI and OLD groups. E, real-time PCR
  analysis for mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress in old and iron-overload
  mice. CK, control group; HI, iron-overload group; OLD, old group; YNG, young group.
  All data are expressed as the means ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, n = 5). Four-week-old
  male C57BL/6 mice were used to induce iron overload by i.p. injection of iron dextran
  (5 mg/mouse/day) twice a week for 3 weeks, and mice were sacrificed 1 week after
  the last injection. And 64-week-old male mice were used for the old group. KEGG,
