caption: Mφs could secrete exosomes. (A) GSEA analyses revealed that Mφs in MPE exhibited
  higher pathway activity for “extracellular exosomes assembly”, “secretion”, “exocytosis”,
  and “endocytosis” as compared to blood. All P-values were calculated by permutation
  test according to the standard GSEA procedure. (B) A representative transmission
  electron microscopy image of purified exosomes (left panel) and the characterization
  of purified exosomes by using nanoparticle tracking (right panel). Scale bar, 100
  nm. (C) Western blot analysis for CD63, TSG101, and GAPDH in the whole cell lysate
  and purified exosomes. (D) Total exosomes in Mφs purified from MPE (n = 5) and blood
  (n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Mann-Whitney test U; NS, not significant.
