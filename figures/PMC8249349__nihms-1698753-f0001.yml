figure_title: Metabolic alterations in pancreatic cancers
caption: '(A) In pancreatic cancer cells, oncogenic KRASG12D upregulates the uptake
  of glucose and enhances glycolysis. Additionally, glycolytic intermediates are shunted
  into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.
  Ultimately, this metabolic rewiring produces metabolites required for the synthesis
  of DNA and/or RNA and substrates for glycosylation. (B) In pancreatic cancers, the
  non-essential amino acid glutamine is metabolized by a non-canonical pathway, whereby
  glutamine-derived glutamate is converted into aspartate. Aspartate is transported
  into the cytosol where it undergoes a series of metabolic reactions that ultimately
  lead to increased NADPH production contributing to redox balance. Abbreviations:
  HK, Hexokinase; GFAT, Glucosamine—fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase isomerizing;
  GlcNAc, Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine; Gln, Glutamine; Glu, Glutamate;
  Ala, Alanine; Asp, Aspartate; Cit, Citrate; Suc, Succinate; Fum, Fumarate; Mal,
  Malate; OAA, Oxaloacetic acid.'
