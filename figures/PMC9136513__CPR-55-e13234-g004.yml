caption: Expression of m6A methylation level and Wnt signalling pathway were downregulated
  in OP‐BMSCs. (A) The mRNA methylation level of OP‐BMSCs was lower than that of BMSCs,
  methylene blue staining (MB) was used as a loading control. The gene expression
  of Mettl3, Mettl14, Wtap, Fto and Ythdf1 was lower in OP‐BMSCs compared to BMSCs.
  (B) Gene and protein expression of Mettl3, Runx2, Opn, Lef1, P‐Gsk‐3β and β‐Catenin
  were decreased after osteogenic induction for 3 days in OP‐BMSCs. (C) Gene and protein
  expression of Mettl3, Runx2, Opn, Lef1, P‐Gsk‐3β and β‐Catenin were also decreased
  after osteogenic induction for 5 days in OP‐BMSCs. Data represent the mean ± SD
  (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)
