caption: 'The FAK inhibitor-Y15 repressed the malignant progression of PC. A. Linc00662-overexpressing
  PC cells were treated with Y15 at different concentrations to identify the suitable
  concentrations. The results of western blotting showed that 2 µM and 5 µM of Y15
  were the suitable concentrations in BxPC-3 cells and PANC-1 cells, respectively,
  which inhibited FAK autophosphorylation activity without effect on FAK expression.
  B. Western blotting showed that Y15 treatment dramatically repressed the levels
  of p-FAK, p-Paxillin, and p-Erk in PC cells. C. The CCK8 assay showed that Y15 treatment
  significantly reversed the increased proliferative capacity of Linc00662-overexpressing
  PC cells. D. The wound healing assay indicated that Y15 treatment significantly
  reversed the increased migratory capacity of Linc00662-overexpressing PC cells,
  magnification: 100 ×. E. The transwell assay indicated that Y15 treatment significantly
  reversed the increased invasive capacity of Linc00662-overexpressing PC cells, magnification:
  100 ×. F. A mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the effect of Y15 on cell
  growth in vivo. Images of transplanted subcutaneous tumors were displayed. G. Y15
  treatment dramatically repressed tumor volume in mice bearing Linc00662-overexpressed
  PC cells. *: P < 0.05. H. Y15 treatment dramatically repressed subcutaneous tumor
  weight in mice bearing Linc00662-overexpressed PC cells. *: P < 0.05. Abbreviations:
  PC: pancreatic cancer, CCK8: cell counting kit-8.'
