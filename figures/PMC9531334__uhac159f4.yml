caption: 'StnCBP is associated with StEXA1-mediated recessive resistance against PVYO
  by recognizing HC-Pro. a Interactions between StEXA1 and SteIF4Es in Y2H assays.
  b Interactions between HC-Pro and SteIF4Es in Y2H assays. c Substitute alanine for
  tyrosine and leucine in eIF4E-binding motifs of StEXA1 or HC-ProO proteins abolished
  their interactions in Y2H assays. d Interactions between StEXA1/StEXA1Y298A, L304A
  with StnCBP in Co-IP assays. e Interactions between HC-ProO/HC-ProN and StnCBP in
  Co-IP assays. In a, b, and c, -W-L represents a medium lacking tryptophan and leucine,
  while -W-L-H-A represents a medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine.
  Paired combinations PGADT7-T/PGBKT7â€“53 and PGADT7-T/PGBKT7-lam represent positive
  and negative controls, respectively. In d and e, total proteins (input) were immunoprecipitated
  with anti-Myc mAb-magnetic beads (Co-IP: Myc), followed by immunoblotting using
  anti-Myc (IB: Myc) and anti-HA (IB: HA) antibodies.'
