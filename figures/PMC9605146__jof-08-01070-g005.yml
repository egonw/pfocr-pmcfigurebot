caption: VRC exposure causes the upregulation of an alternative ergosterol biosynthesis
  pathway in F. keratoplasticum. (a) A heatmap showing log2 fold-change values for
  F. keratoplasticum 2781 when exposed to VRC, and effects of F. graminearum PH-1
  ΔFgSR [] and ΔFgAtrR [] mutations. Genes existing as a single copy in either F.
  graminearum or FSSC are indicated in blue font. Genes that are normally involved
  in cholesterol biosynthesis are highlighted in green. * = Fg-erg3, Fg-erg5, Fg-erg6
  and Fg-erg24 ‘A’ and ‘B’ paralogs were renamed to be consistent with the F. keratoplasticum
  nomenclature (see text for further details). (b) Proposed alternative pathway upon
  azole exposure is indicated by the dashed arrow line (X = to be experimentally confirmed
  sterol intermediates). Differential expression of genes is indicated by log2 fold-change
  values in the green boxes beside the genes. Dashed line (---) in green boxes indicates
  log2 fold change values < 1.00 and/or p-value > 0.05. The expression levels of erg6A,
  erg6B, cyp51A, cyp51B, highlighted in bold, were verified by qPCR. Genes in orange
  font do not take part in ergosterol biosynthesis under normal growth conditions
  nor in the cells’ response to azole exposure. Log2 fold change values of more than
  3 are highlighted in bold numerals.
