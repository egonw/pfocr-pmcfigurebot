caption: 'The inflammatory microenvironment promotes osteogenic differentiation of
  TSCs, and palovarotene can influence osteogenesis. (a) CCK8 proliferation assay
  was used to determine the dose range of palovarotene. Palovarotene at 0.5, 1, and
  2 μM concentration had less effect on TSCs proliferation. Coculture system of activated
  macrophages and TSCs was constructed. (b) ALP and ARS staining in TSCs after coculture
  with macrophages. Data are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. #p < 0.05
  and ##p < 0.01. Scale bar = 50 μm. (c) Western blot analysis and relevant quantitative
  analysis of OCN, SOX9, and RUNX2. Data are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p
  < 0.01. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. (d) The mRNA expression of OCN, SOX9, RUNX2, MMP-9,
  IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Data are means ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01.
  #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01.'
