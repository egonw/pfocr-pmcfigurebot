caption: Circ_0001013 bound to miR-136 in GC cells. (A) Venn plot of the overlapping
  miRNAs between the potentially bound miRNAs of hsa_circ_0001013 in Circinteractome
  database and the GC-associated miRNAs in the MNDR v3.1 database. (B) Heatmap of
  the KEGG pathway involving miRNAs in the miRPathDB v2.0 database, where darker blue
  indicates higher the-log10 (p-value). (C) Targeted binding of circ_0001013 to miR-136.
  (D) RT-qPCR detection of circ_0001013 captured by biotin-coupled miR-136. (E) RT-qPCR
  detection of circ_0001013 enriched by specific probes. (F) RT-qPCR detection of
  miR-136 enrichment by circ_0001013-specific probe. (G) Dual-luciferase reporter
  assay verification of the binding relationship between circ_0001013 and miR-136.
  (H) FISH detection of circ_0001013 and miR-136 co-localization (Ã— 400 magnification).
  (I) RT-qPCR estimation of miR-136 expression in GC tissues and the adjacent normal
  tissues. (J) Correlation analysis of circ_0001013 and miR-136 expression in GC tissues.
  (K) miR-136 expression in AGS cells after circ_0001013 silencing or overexpression.
  *P < 0.05. Each cell experiment was repeated three times. Two-group data were analyzed
  by unpaired t test (DEFI), muti-group data by one-way ANOVA (K) or two-way ANOVA
  (G), and correlation between two variables by Pearson correlation coefficient (J).
