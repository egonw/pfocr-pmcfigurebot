caption: 'Network analysis of WT1 co-expressed genes indicates its participation in
  NSCLC progression. (A) Protein interaction network of WT1 co-expressed genes screened
  by cBioportal and plotted by STRING. (B) GO enrichment (BP: biological process,
  MF: molecular function, CC: cellular component) and KEGG pathway analyses of WT1
  co-expressed genes. –Log10 transformed false discovery rates (FDR) were plotted
  for each enriched functional category. (C) Western blot examination of WT1, MYC
  and MMP2 after WT1 siRNA transfection in A549 and H1299 cells'
article_title: Wilms’ tumour gene 1 (WT1) enhances non-small cell lung cancer malignancy
  and is inhibited by microRNA-498-5p.
