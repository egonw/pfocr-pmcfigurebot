caption: 'a Flowchart to show the construction of syngeneic subcutaneous tumor models
  and in vivo drug testing. Galunisertib (Gal) or CMC-Na (control drug) are administered
  through oral gavage twice per day (12 h interval) for 14 consecutive days at a dosage
  of 200 mg/kg body weight when the solid tumor could be touched (~2–3 mm in diameter).
  b PET-CT results show TRAMP-C1 cells-derived tumor tissue exhibited 18F-FDG uptake
  in the subcutaneous flank region. TRAMP-C1-derived tumor tissue (the "light spots")
  detected on PET-CT is indicated by the blue arrowhead. c Macroscopic images of TRAMP-C1
  cells-derived tumor tissue (n = 7–8 mice each group). Scale bars: 1 cm. d, e Quantitative
  analysis of tumor volume (d) and tumor weight (e) from TRAMP-C1 cells-derived subcutaneous
  tumor tissues. Tumor volume calculations were obtained using the formula V = (W × W × L)/2
  for caliper measurements, where V is tumor volume, W is tumor width, L is tumor
  length. f, g Representative images of HE staining show after Gal treatment, the
  cell density of TRAMP-C1derived tumor tissue decreased compared with the corresponding
  control group (n = 5 each group, **P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U-test). Scare bar: 50 μm.
  h, i Representative images of CD206 IHC staining show after Gal treatment, the number
  of M2 tumor-associated macrophages decreased compared with the corresponding control
  group (n = 5 each group, **P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U-test). Scare bar: 50 μm.'
