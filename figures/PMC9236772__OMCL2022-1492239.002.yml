caption: Nrf2 agonist protects macrophages from TP-induced toxicity and inhibits M1
  polarization. (a) Effect of SFN on Raw264.7 cell viability after TP treatment (n
  = 6). (b) Effect of SFN on the Nrf2 signaling pathway in Raw264.7 cells (n = 6).
  (c) Changes in M1 macrophages in Raw264.7 cells after SFN pretreatment. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. TP.
