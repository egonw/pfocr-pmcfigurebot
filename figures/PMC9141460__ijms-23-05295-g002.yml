caption: Boxplots of serum inflammatory cytokine levels at 6 h after LPS-induced ALI.
  Compared to the control group, serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, and IL-8
  were significantly decreased in the MSC group. The box is drawn from the first quartile
  to the third quartile with a horizontal line in the middle to denote the median.
  The whiskers extending from the box indicate variability outside the upper and lower
  quartiles. Each circle represents the concentration of each animal. n = 8 mice/group.
