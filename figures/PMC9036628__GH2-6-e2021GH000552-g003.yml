caption: Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling by environmental
  pollutants. Environmental pollutants such as the pesticide TCDD can cross the membrane
  and bind to AhR in the cytoplasm, causing this protein to translocate to the nucleus
  and dimerize with ARNT. The AhR‐ARNT dimer binds to its response elements and promotes
  transcription of its target genes that include cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Mixtures
  of pollutants such as those with different persistent organic pollutants and arsenic
  and benzo(a)pyrene can cause an overactivation of this metabolic pathway with its
  consequent stimulation of cell survival and proliferation.
