caption: FPR2 stimulation enhances NADPH production and regulates non-oxidative phase
  of pentose phosphate pathway. CaLu-6 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then
  stimulated with WKYMVm (Panels (A,E)) or ANXA1 (Panels (C,G)) for the indicated
  times. Cells were also preincubated with WRW4 before WKYMVm (Panels (B,F)) or ANXA1
  (Panels (D,H)) stimulation. NADPH/NADP+ assay was performed according to manufacturer’s
  instruction (Panels (A–D)). Transketolase (TKT) enzymatic activity was determined
  by recording fluorescence (RFU) released from the conversion of non-fluorescent
  probe to a fluorescent probe (λEx = 535/λEm = 587). Data are reported in bar graphs
  (Panels (E–H)). Data are representative of three independent experiments. * p <
  0.05 compared to unstimulated cells. § p < 0.05 compared to stimulated cells.
