caption: 'LINC00473 promoted osteogenic differentiation and suppressed the adipogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs through activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
  (a) ALP staining for osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under an inverted phase
  contrast microscope (scale bar = 1000 μm). (b) ALP activity assay for osteogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs. (c) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels of BSPII,
  OPN3 and Runx‐2 in each group. (d) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels of
  β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under the condition of osteogenic stimulation.
  (e) Western blotting showing the protein expression levels of BSPII, OPN3, Runx‐2,
  β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under osteogenic stimulation. (f,g) The
  quantification of integrated density in target bands normalized to GAPDH. (h) Oil
  red O staining for adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under an inverted phase
  contrast microscope (scale bar = 400 μm). (i) Cellular TG content assay for adipogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs. (j) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels of PPAR‐γ,
  CEBP‐α, and FABP4 in each group. (k) qRT‐PCR showing the mRNA expression levels
  of β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under adipogenic stimulation (AS). (l)
  Western blotting showing the protein expression levels of PPAR‐γ, CEBP‐α, FABP4,
  β‐catenin, LRP5, and TCF1 in each group under adipogenic stimulation (AS). (m,n)
  The quantification of integrated density in target bands normalized to GAPDH. Data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. (b–d,f,g)
  **P < 0.01 compared with the Control group, and ##P < 0.01 compared with the OS
  group, OS + Vector group and OS + up‐LINC00473 + DKK1 group. (i–k,m,n) **P < 0.01
  compared with the Control group, ##P < 0.01 compared with the the AS group, AS + Vector
  group and AS + up‐LINC00473 + DKK1 group. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; AS, adipogenic
  stimulation; BSPII, bone sialoprotein II; CEBP‐α, CCAAT/enhancer‐binding protein‐α;
