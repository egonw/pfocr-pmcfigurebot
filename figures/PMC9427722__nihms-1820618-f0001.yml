caption: 'Regulation of prostatic steroid synthesis. Prostaticsteroidogenesis shows
  3 pathways that can account for changes in androgens andglucocorticoid. A Testicular
  synthesis is the prime source of prostatictestosterone (T). T can be synthesized
  by the classical pathway (black arrows)or the backdoor pathway (white arrows). 5ARIs
  block both SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 reducing the conversion of T to DHT within the prostate.
  However, 5ARI also canblock the synthesis of DHT by the backdoor pathway (white
  arrows). This treatment would divert 17α-OH pregnenolone and SRD5A2 reducing the
  conversion of T to DHT within the prostate. However, 5ARI also canblock the synthesis
  of DHT by the backdoor pathway (white arrows). This treatment would divert 17α-OH
  pregnenolone and 17α-OH progesteroneinto pathways for the synthesis of glucocorticoids
  (gray gradient arrows). 5ARI also block the degradation of glucocorticoids to dihydrometabolites2;
  (B).Cholesterol levels (μg/gm tissue), the precursor for all steroid synthesis,were
  higher in I-BPH (white bars, n = 10) than S-BPH (black bars, n = 36) regardless
  of treatment; (C). Pregnenolone; (D). DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone); (E). ASD (androsteredione);
  (F). T (testosterone); (G). DHT (dihydrotestosterone); (H). cortisol; (I).Cortisone;
  (J).deoxycorticosterone; (K) corticosterone: Medical treatment at the time of surgery
  was none; α-B (α-blocker); 5ARI (5α-reductaseinhibitor); or α-B + 5ARI. Steroids
  levels were expressed as ng/gm tissue with S-BPH (n = 55) treatment groups none
  (n = 23), α-B (n = 17), 5ARI (n = 8), or α-B+5ARI (n = 7) and I-BPH(n = 32) treatment
  groups none (n = 7) or α-B (n = 25). Error bars (SD) and Pvalues were shown only
  when significance was achieved (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.001).'
