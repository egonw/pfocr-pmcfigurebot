caption: 'Coexpressed genes, targeted miRNA, and lncRNA of UBE2C (A). The correlation
  of UBE2C expression levels and CDC20, TROAP, TPX2, CDCA3, and KIF2C expression levels
  from the GEPIA2.0 website. p < 0.01. (B). Spearman correlation heatmap of the above
  five genes (CDC20, TROAP, TPX2, CDCA3, and KIF2C) and UBE2C for a variety of cancers.
  The results were obtained by TIMER2.0. (C). A total of 50 proteins that interact
  with UBE2C were obtained using STRING. (D). The intersection of the 50 proteins
  that interact with UBE2C and the 100 coexpressed genes identified two genes: CDC20
  and MAD2L1. (E). The genes that controlled the expression (indicated by the green
  line) or phosphorylation (indicated by the blue line) of UBE2C were derived from
  the Pcviz pathway tool. (F,G). The GO analysis and KEGG analysis of the above 150
  coexpressed or interacting genes by the OmicsBean commercial software showed that
  most of the enriched genes were in the cell cycle pathway.'
