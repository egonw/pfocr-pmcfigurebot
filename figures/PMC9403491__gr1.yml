caption: mGluR-LTD requires the CaMKIIα isoform and its autophosphorylation at T286
  but not T305/306.A, example traces and time course of synaptic response, measured
  by excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope of the CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral
  pathway, in wildtype hippocampal slices before and after chemical mGluR stimulation
  with DHPG (10 μM for 10 min). B, example traces and time course of synaptic response
  in CaMKIIα KO slices before and after the same DHPG treatment as in A show abolished
  mGluR-LTD. C, example traces and time course of synaptic response in T286A slices before
  and after DHPG treatment. D, example traces and time course of synaptic response
  in T305/306AV slices before and after stimulation with DHPG (10 μM for 10 min).
  E, quantification of the change in synaptic response (measured by EPSP slope) after
  DHPG stimulation in wildtype, CaMKIIα KO, T286A, and T305/306AV slices. Both CaMKII
  KO and T286A animals demonstrated severe impairments in DHPG-induced mGluR LTD when
  compared with wildtype animals while T305/306AV slices did not show any LTD deficit,
  indicating CaMKII and its T286 autophosphorylation are required for mGluR LTD (one-way
  ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test versus WT, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, n = 6, 6, 7, 5 slices).
