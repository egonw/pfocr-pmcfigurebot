caption: Effects of nitrogen on rice ShB. The rice ammonium transporter AMT1;1 positively
  regulates rice resistance to ShB. This phenomenon is caused not by ammonium itself,
  but by N-derived metabolites. AMT1;1 enhances the resistance of rice to ShB by promoting
  the accumulation of N metabolites, such as amino acids and chlorophyll, and activating
  the downstream ETH signaling pathway. Amino acid (AA) accumulation can inhibit R.
  solani and promote chlorophyll synthesis, which is a positive regulator of rice
  ShB. A low concentration of    activates the ETH signal through AMT and a high concentration
  of    inhibits the ETH signal. ETH signaling positively regulates ShB resistance
  and    uptake, suggesting that ETH signaling acts downstream of AMT and that    uptake
  is also under feedback control.
