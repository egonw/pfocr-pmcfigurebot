figure_title: Increased expression of genes associated with innate adjuvant signaling
  in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) after radiation in radioimmunogenic tumors
caption: '(A) Experiment design: MC38 or Panc02-SIY (P2SIY) tumors were implanted
  into WT mice and then treated with ±12 Gy of radiation therapy when they reached
  5–6 mm average diameter. Twenty-four hours posttreatment, tumors were harvested,
  and CD45+ were processed for single RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). n = 3 animal/group.
  (B) Graph-based clustering in the Loupe Cell Browser from 10X Genomics (UMAP plot).
  Each dot represents an individual cell. (C) Heatmap showing the z-score of expression
  for cDC-specific genes across each cluster that was identified in (B). (D) Cells
  in cluster 16 that expressed one or more transcripts of Zbtb46 were labeled in red
  and used for downstream analysis and comparisons. Each dot represents an individual
  cell. (E) cDCs from radiation-treated MC38 tumors were compared with cDCs from P2SIY
  tumors using differential expression, and the data were plotted on using a volcano
  plot. Each dot represents an individual gene, with the color indicating genes that
  are significantly increased in MC38 cDCs (red), significantly increased in P2SIY
  cDCs (blue) and not significant (gray). Genes were considered significant with BH-adjusted
  P-value < 0.1 and fold change > 1.3. (F) The significant genes (red + blue dots)
  were input in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program from QIAGEN to identify
  canonical pathways related to “cellular immune response.” (G) Within IPA, upstream
  analysis was performed to identify transcriptional regulator, enzymes, and cytokines
  that are predicted to be activated or inhibited in corresponding cDC populations.
  Dots represent significant upstream regulators and their corresponding Z-score.
  Red dots predict activation in radiation-treated MC38 cDCs, and blue dots predict
  activation in P2SIY tumors. Pathways and regulators were considered significant
  with P-value > 0.05 and absolute z-score > 2.0 in IPA.'
