caption: 'Schematic illustration of the main intracellular and extracellular metabolic
  variations detected during the osteoinduction of hAMSCs. Metabolites indicated in
  bold correspond to those detected by NMR. Metabolites that fluctuate over time show
  a schematic scale underneath (in white background for lipid and polar extracts (LE
  and PE, respectively), and in black background for media samples (M), where unchanged,
  increased, and decreased levels are shown in yellow, red, and blue circles, respectively.
  It should be noted that information on polar extracts refers to previously reported
  data []. Arrows crossing the cell membrane represent metabolites exchanged between
  intra- and extracellular environments. Abbreviations: 3-letter code used for amino
  acids; 1-MG, 1-monoacylgliceride; 3-HBA, 3-hydroxybutyrate; 3-HIBA, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate;
