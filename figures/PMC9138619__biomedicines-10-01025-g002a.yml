caption: 'Molecular landscapes of the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) from the three core KEGG pathways (“Cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling”,
  “TNF signaling” and “NFκB signaling”) following TNFα stimulation of human cortical
  spheroids for (A) 4 h, (B) 12 h and (C) 36 h. Protein functions and interactions
  were deduced based on information obtained from UniprotKB (https://www.uniprot.org/;
  accessed on 1 January 2022) and Genecards (https://www.genecards.org; accessed on
  15 January 2022). A detailed description of the protein-protein interactions occurring
  in these molecular landscapes can be found in . Rectangularly framed protein: membrane-bound
  receptor; protein in green or red (rounded) rectangle frame: encoded by an up- or
  downregulated DEG, respectively; protein in dark-gray-filled (rounded) rectangle:
  encoded by a core KEGG pathway DEG; protein in light-gray-filled (rounded) rectangle:
  encoded by a DEG not in the core KEGG pathways; protein in white-filled (rounded)
  rectangle: not encoded by a DEG. Black arrows: stimulation or induction; inhibition
  arcs: inhibition; dotted arrows: translocation; fading arrow: enzymatic conversion;
  cl: cleavage.'
