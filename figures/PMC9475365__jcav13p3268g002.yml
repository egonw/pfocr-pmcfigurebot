caption: Effect of Salmonella on autophagic punctate formation. The ASH-3 and KMH-2
  cells (106 cells/well) were placed into 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for
  24 hours. Cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-LC3 for 6 hours and
  then infected with Salmonella (108 cfu) or PBS for 90 min. (A) The LC3 puncta were
  visualized by fluorescence microscopy after treatment with Salmonella. (B) Shows
  the quantification of autophagosome punctate percentage of cells (mean ± SD, n=11).
