figure_title: Human adipose tissue GPSM1 is correlated with obesity and metabolic
  quantitative traits
caption: a IHC staining of GPSM1 in visceral fat from individuals without/with overweight
  or obesity (n = 5 biologically independent individuals per group). Scale bars, 100
  μm (top) and 50 μm (bottom). Quantification is shown (right). b qPCR analysis indicating
  expression of GPSM1 in visceral fat from individuals without/with overweight or
  obesity (BMI < 24, n = 36 biologically independent individuals; BMI ≥ 24, n = 61
  biologically independent individuals). GPSM1 mRNA level was normalized to RPLP0
  mRNA. c Correlation between GPSM1 mRNA expression in visceral fat with clinical
  metabolic traits, including BMI (n = 97 biologically independent individuals), Fasting
  Plasma Glucose (FPG, n = 54 biologically independent individuals), HbA1c (n = 26
  biologically independent individuals), Total cholesterol (n = 64 biologically independent
  individuals), LDL-c (n = 64 biologically independent individuals), ALT (n = 92 biologically
  independent individuals), and AST (n = 92 biologically independent individuals)
  from human subjects. d Model of how macrophage GPSM1 controls TLR-induced NF-κB
  signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and thus influence adipocyte insulin
  sensitivity and function. Mice with myeloid-specific GPSM1 ablation displayed ameliorated
  adipose inflammation, liver steatosis, and improved systemic glucose tolerance,
  insulin sensitivity, and energy expenditure upon HFD challenge. Mechanically, upon
  LPS stimulation, macrophage GPSM1 loss could upregulate TNFAIP3 transcription via
  the Gαi3/cAMP/PKA/CREB axis, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling. One small-molecule
  compound, AN-465, targeting GPSM1, would be a candidate for metabolic therapy. Data
  are presented as means ± SEM (a), or boxplots represent the median value, with lower
  and upper hinges corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles, and lower and upper
  whiskers extending from the hinge to the smallest and largest value (b). P values
  are determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (a, b), Pearson’s correlation
  analysis showing R values, and two-tailed P values (c).
