caption: Schematic of mechanisms of the metabolic switch in response to macrophage
  activation by LPS. Activation induces the metabolic switch, which upregulates glycolysis
  and the PPP, breaking the TCA cycle and causing a switch from oxidative phosphorylation
  to reverse electron transfer to generate mitochondrial ROS. Upregulation of glycolysis
  and the PPP causes release of IFN-β, which is involved in an intricate feedback
  loop, via increased activation of NOX2 oxidase. NOX2 oxidase, in turn, can increase
  the production of IFN-β. Blue arrows represent the current literature, and purple
  arrows represent the novel concepts of this study, including the positive feedback
  loop. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 21 March 2022).
