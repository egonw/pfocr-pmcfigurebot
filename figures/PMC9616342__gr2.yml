caption: 'Serotonin pathway genes altered by MS and Enr in the prefrontal cortex and
  miRNA target prediction. (A) Relative rat gene expression of Slc6a4, Htr1a, Tph2,
  and Maoa is shown as mean ± SEM. MS and MS+Enr expression are shown relative to
  control. Data were normalized to the geometric mean of GAPDH,β-Actin, and 18S ribosomal RNA.
  Dotted lines on Tph1 indicate a significant interaction. miRWalk was used to predict
  miRNAs targeting Slc6a4 and Htr1a. (B) Targeting miRNAs are shown as a table with
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction–tested miRNAs bolded. Starred miRNAs were
  selected based on literature search but did not appear in miRWalk prediction. (C)
  Chromosomal localization of genes and miRNAs were extracted from Rat Genome Database
  and miRbase, respectively. Localization was visualized using PhenoGram. miRNAs in
  green target Slc6a4, magenta target Htr1a, and blue target both genes. Significance
  was determined using two-way analysis of variance (n = 6 per group, N = 36); ∗p
  < .05; #p < .10. Enr, environmental enrichment; miRNA, microRNA; MS, maternal separation.'
