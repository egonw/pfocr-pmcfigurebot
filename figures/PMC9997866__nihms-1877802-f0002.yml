caption: Cell-based functional assays of untreated BEAS-2B cells (CTRL) and the BEAS-2B
  cells treated with three types of CeO2 NPs. (A) The percentage of EdU positivity
  of untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells (scale bar=50 μm). (B) The cell cycle
  distribution of untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells. (C) The immunofluorescence
  intensity of PCNA in untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells (scale bar=20 μm).
  (D) MTS assays of untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells. (E) The GSH levels
  in untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells. (F) The levels of IL-6, IL-8 and
  IL-1β in untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells. (G) The relative mitochondria
  potential in untreated and CeO2 NP-treated BEAS-2B cells.
