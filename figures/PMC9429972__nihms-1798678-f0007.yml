figure_title: Vpr inhibits ubiquitination of histone H1 variants by CRL4DCAF1
caption: (A) Schematic of histone h1 protein domains (top; positions indicated are
  for histone H1.2). Heatmap of ubiquitination changes on histone H1 variants. All
  sites are aligned to the sequence positions of histone H1.2. Cells with a red outline
  were identified by peptides that cannot distinguish between histone variants.(B)
  Denaturing ubiquitin immunoprecipitation analysis of histone H1.2 with Vpr titration.(C)
  Denaturing ubiquitin immunoprecipitation analysis of histone H1.2 with MLN4924 titration.(D)
  Schematic of experimental and data analysis workflows for quantitative AP-MS analysis
  of histone H1.2 in the presence and absence of Vpr co-expression.(E) Volcano plot
  of histone H1.2 protein binding changes in response to Vpr expression. Proteins
  with |log2 fold change| > 0.58 (i.e., 1.5-fold change) and adjusted p value < 0.05
  are highlighted in red.(F) Schematic of a fluorescence-based assay for HDR of DNA
  double-strand breaks.(G) HDR assay of cells in response to VPR expression and MLN4924
  treatment. Bar heights represent an average of three biological replicates and error
  bars indicate the standard deviation (n = 3 biological replicates).(H) A model for
  HIV-1 VPR-mediated inhibition of histone H1 ubiquitination, DNA repair, cell-cycle
  arrest, and cell death.See also  and .
