caption: Intrathecal AAV-CM induces sustained IFNβ. (A) IFNβ expression in the brain
  was evaluated in luciferase reporter mice by in vivo imaging and showed that intrathecal
  administration of AAV-CM induced IFNβ in the CNS of mice was dose-dependent. In
  vivo imaging of IFNβ/luciferase reporter mice that received intrathecal AAV-CM.
  The level of IFNβ was significantly increased at 1-, 3- and 7-days post injection
  and was detectable up to 21 days post injection. n = 3–4 in each group. B–D) Micrographs
  of brain sections from mice that received AAV-CM or AAV-GFP intrathecally. Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI (blue). (B) Co-localization (arrows) of IFNYβ/YFP + (green)
  and extraparenchymal CD45 + cells (red) in mice are shown. Insert shows the co-localization
  of GFP+ (green) and extraparenchymal CD45 + cells. (C) IFNYβ/YFP + (green, arrow)
  or GFP+ cells (green in insert, arrow) in the choroid plexus. (D) Co-localization
  (arrows) of IFNYβ/YFP+ (green) or GFP+ cells (green in insert) and GFAP+ (astrocytes)
  in the perivascular area of the lateral ventricle. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. The results were analyzed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney u-test. * p < 0.05,
  Scale bars. 10 µm.
