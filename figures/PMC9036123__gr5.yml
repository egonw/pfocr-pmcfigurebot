caption: 'A4B17 shows enhanced activity over enzalutamideTranscriptomic experiments
  showing changes in gene expression after treatment of LAPC-4 cell with 5 μM A4B17
  and enzalutamide for 16 h. Volcano plots showing changes in expression of genes
  dysregulated by A4B17 and enzalutamide. Genes were considered dysregulated if associated
  with an adjusted p-value (y-axis) of 0.05 (horizontal dashed line). No threshold
  was applied on log2 (fold change). Upregulated genes are plotted in red, downregulated
  ones in green, and non-regulated genes in gray.(C) Heatmap showing hierarchical
  clustering of 14 common genes dysregulated by both A4B17 and enzalutamide.(D) Quantitative
  real-time PCR analysis showing the effect of A4B17 and enzalutamide on select genes
  identified in the heatmap. The results represent the mean ± SEM (n = 8, p values
  are ∗∗: p = 0.002, ∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001, n.s: not significant). Also see  and .'
