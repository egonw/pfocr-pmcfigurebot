caption: 'HMGB1 protein activates the AR signalling pathway by directly interacting
  with AR protein in PCa in vitro. (A) Following transfection with exogenous HMGB1,
  the expression levels of AR and HMGB1 in LNCaP were detected by western blotting.
  *P<0.05 compared with pLVX or sh-Scramble. (B) Following transfection with sh-HMGB1,
  the expression levels of AR and HMGB1 in 22RV1 cells were detected by western blotting.
  *P<0.05 compared with pLVX or sh-Scramble. (C) The growth abilities of LNCaP-neo,
  LNCaP-HMGB1, 22RV1-shScramble, and 22RV1-shHMGB1 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay.
  *P<0.05 compared with the 0-h group. (D) The effects of HMGB1 on the transcription
  levels of PSA and TMPRSS2 in LNCaP-neo, LNCaP-HMGB1, 22RV1-shScramble, and 22RV1-shHMGB1
  cells were examined by RT-qPCR. *P<0.05 compared with pLVX or sh-Scramble. (E) After
  treatment with pLVX-shAR, AR, HMGB1, PSA, and TMPRSS2 protein expression levels
  in LNCaP-neo, LNCaP-HMGB1 and LNCaP-HMGB1/shAR cells were detected by western blotting.
  *P<0.05 compared with the control group; #P<0.05 compared with the pLVX-HMGB1 group.
  (F) The effects of HMGB1 and AR on the transcription levels of PSA and TMPRSS2 in
  LNCaP-neo, LNCaP-HMGB1 and LNCaP-HMGB1/shAR cells were examined by RT-qPCR. *P<0.05
  compared with the pLVX group; #P<0.05 compared with the pLVX-HMGB1 group. (G) Following
  transfection with exogenous HMGB1 or sh-HMGB1, the transactivating activity of AR
  in LNCaP-neo, LNCaP-HMGB1, 22RV1-shScramble, and 22RV1-shHMGB1 cells was determined
  by a reporter gene assay. *P<0.05 compared with the pLVX group. (H and I) ChIP assay
  followed by RT-qPCR was used to detect the effect of HMGB1 on the ability of AR
  to bind to the promoters of PSA and TMPRSS2 in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells. *P<0.05 compared
  with the pLVX group or sh-Scramble group. (J) AR-Turbo and HMGB1-Rluc, the BRET
  fusion constructs, were cotransfected into PC3 cells, and the BRET signal was measured
  after the addition of the coelenterazine substrate. Western blotting revealed the
  fold changes of the expression levels of the fusion proteins. *P<0.05 compared with
  the AR-Turbo/HMGB1-Rluc ratio=0 group. (K) A schematic of the principle of the BRET
  assay. HMGB1, high-mobility group protein B1; AR, androgen receptor; PCa, prostate
  cancer; PSA, prostate specific antigen; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease, serine
  2; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation;
  BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer.'
