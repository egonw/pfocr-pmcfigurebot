caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of proteins deregulated in human dermal
  fibroblasts (HDFs) treated with leukocyte- and platelet-rich plasma (L-PRP) supernatant
  and related to an inflammatory response. Deregulation related to stimuli similar
  to those provided by (A) IFNB1 or (B) immunoglobulins was observed.
