caption: Pathway and biological functions affected by RBMS1 knockdown in adipocytes.
  (A) The most significant signaling and metabolic pathways and (B) biological functions
  identified through IPA analysis of differentially expressed genes in RBMS1KD adipocytes.
  The ranking is based on the negative log of the ρ value of the enrichment score
  (upper x–axis) as calculated using IPA. The yellow straight line shows the designated
  significant threshold −log p value = 1.301 (ρ < 0.05) for pathway analysis and −log
  p value = 2 (ρ < 0.01) for biological functions.
