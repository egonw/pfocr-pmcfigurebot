caption: Sty1 localization in response to stress is altered in absence of Srk1. Wild-type
  (a) and srk1∆ (b) cells expressing genomic sty1:HA were grown in YES medium to mid-log
  phase, remained untreated (0 min) or treated with 1 M KCl, and fixed with methanol
  at the indicated times. Sty1 localization was detected by indirect immunocytochemistry
  with anti-HA primary antibody (upper panels) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (middle
  panels). An overlay of both is shown in the lower panels. (c) Cells with Sty1 localized
  in the nucleus, in sty1:HA and sty1:HA srk1Δ cells treated with 1 M KCl at indicated
  times, were quantified. Data represent the average of two biological replicates.
