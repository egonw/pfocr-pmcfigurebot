figure_title: Alternative oxidase (AOX) expression on a mutator background leads to
  activation of the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt) and inflammatory
  pathways
caption: '(A) Transcripts with the highest experimental fold change differing significantly
  in AOX–Mut versus Mut in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of mouse skeletal muscle
  shown as a volcano plot. (B) Top 10 activated upstream regulators in AOX–Mut compared
  with Mut in RNA-seq data of mouse skeletal muscle analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA). (C) Comparison of the most significant canonical pathways changed
  in AOX–Mut versus Mut based on RNA-seq data of mouse skeletal muscle analyzed using
  IPA. (D, E) Heatmaps of RNA-seq data of mouse skeletal muscle analyzed using IPA
  showing (D) mitochondrial integrated stress response genes and (E) acute phase response
  genes. WT (n = 5), AOX (n = 5), mutator (n = 5), and AOX–mutator (n = 3), biological
  replicates, RNA-seq for each sample was performed once. Abbreviations: WT, wildtype
  mice; AOX, AOX mice; AOX–Mut, AOX–mutator mice; Mut, mutator mice.'
