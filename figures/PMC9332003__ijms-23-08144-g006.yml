caption: Neuro-regenerative effect of EPO on Aβ-induced dementia model mice visualized
  with pyramidal cell density in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the pyramidal neuron layer
  within the mouse hippocampus. (A,B) Representative photomicrographs of coronal sections
  of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields stained with 0.1% cresyl violet solution were
  taken at 100× and 400× magnifications. All the samples were stained simultaneously
  to maintain an identical condition. The images were taken with the same amount of
  light and at the same exposure time and magnification. (C) Chart shows total area
  of relative Nissl-stained levels. Three slices were measured per mouse, and there
  were 4 mice per group. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.005 according to independent t-test
  in (C).
