caption: Functional annotation analysis of DEGs determined from the YC-2020 and JXA1
  group. (A) GO enrichment at different timepoints post-infection. The left side of
  the panel shows the significantly enriched GO terms (|NES| ≥ 1.5, padj <0.1) obtained
  at all three timepoints. Gene sets are represented by nodes, in which color corresponds
  to hpi; node size corresponds to the number of gene members within them; the size
  and color of the edges correspond to the similarity score between terms. All GO
  terms are clustered according to their gene members’ overlap size, and each cluster’s
  subject is written on top. GO terms associated with immune response, antigen processing
  and presentation are shown in the panel’s upper and lower bar plots on the right
  side. Each bar contains a padj of the permutation test. (B) Lollipop plot of the
  significantly enriched KEGG pathway at different hpi. (C) Heat map of the expression
  profiles of hotspot genes associated with innate immunity. Each layer of circles
  represents a comparison group, and the selected genes include common cytokines,
  ISGs, MHCs, and critical regulators in associated pathways.
