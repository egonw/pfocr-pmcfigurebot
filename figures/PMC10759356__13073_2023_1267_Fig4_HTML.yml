caption: 'PIT1-negative tumor epithelial cells. a Heatmap showing the expression of
  differentially expressed genes in each cluster. b Multiplex immunohistochemical
  staining of GZMK (red) and TPIT (yellow) in corticotroph tumors. The thickness of
  the sections is 4 μm. Scale bar: 20 μm. c Inferred developmental trajectory of clusters
  T09 and T12 by RNA velocity. d GSEA plot showing the pathway enriched in cluster
  T12 over other clusters. e Bubble heatmap showing the pathway marker genes of each
  cluster. f Violin plots showing the expression of response to type I interferon
  pathway marker genes of each cluster'
