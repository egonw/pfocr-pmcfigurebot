caption: Carambolaside W inhibited H1N1 infection-induced apoptosis regarding Annexin-V/PI
  staining assay. (A) Detection of early and late apoptotic status of cells by flow
  cytometry. (B) Cell morphology and fluorescence intensity were examined using an
  inverted microscope. Green fluorescence indicates early apoptotic cells and red
  fluorescence indicates late apoptotic and necrotic cells. The concentration of carambolaside
  W used here is 32 Î¼M. Each experiment was repeated at least three times (n = 3).
