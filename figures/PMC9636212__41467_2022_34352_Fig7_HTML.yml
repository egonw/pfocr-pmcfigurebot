figure_title: Activation of the MYD88 pathway induces RANKL by decreasing CREB, CBP,
  and STAT3 ubiquitination in the osteocyte-enriched cell population
caption: 'a Degradation kinetics of CREB, CBP, and STAT3 proteins in Ocy stimulated
  with Pam3CSK4 or PBS. Ocy was treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μM) and Pam3CSK4/PBS
  every 24 h. Graphs show the intensities of the protein bands relative to those at
  0 h (%). Normalized by β-Actin. b–d Western blotting of K48-ubiquitinated proteins
  after immunoprecipitation (IP) of CREB, CBP, and STAT3. Ocy was stimulated with
  Pam3CSK4 or PBS for 48 h. e Western blotting of FBXL19 in Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4
  or PBS. f IP of CREB and CBP followed by Western blotting for FBXL19. 48 h after
  Pam3CSK4 or PBS stimulation. g Western blotting of K48-ubiquitinated proteins after
  IP of CREB or CBP. Cell lysates of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged
  mouse FBXL19 were used. Graphs show the relative intensities of CREB, CBP, and FBXL19
  protein bands against β-Actin in whole cell lysates. h Left: Western blotting of
  RANKL using cell lysates from differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged
  mouse FBXL19. Right: Relative RANKL protein levels normalized by β-Actin. i qPCR
  analysis of Rankl in differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged mouse
  FBXL19 stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or PBS for 48 h. j Western blotting of PDLIM2 in
  Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or PBS. k IP of STAT3 followed by Western blotting
  for PDLIM2. 48 h after Pam3CSK4 or PBS stimulation. l Western blotting of K48-ubiquitinated
  proteins after IP of STAT3. Cell lysates of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing
  MYC-tagged mouse PDLIM2 were used. Graphs show the relative intensities of STAT3
  and PDLIM2 protein bands against β-Actin in whole cell lysates. m Left: Western
  blotting of RANKL using cell lysates from differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing
  MYC-tagged mouse PDLIM2. Right: Relative RANKL protein levels normalized by β-Actin.
  n qPCR analysis of Rankl in differentiated IDG-SW3 cells overexpressing MYC-tagged
  mouse FBXL19 stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or PBS for 48 h. a–f, i–k, n Pam3 = Pam3CSK4.
  a, g, h, l, m Graphs were created from the data of three independent experiments
  (n = 3). i, n Representative data from three independent experiments with similar
  results, each with three replicates (n = 3). a, g, h, i, l, m, n Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. #p < 0.05 with two-tailed unpaired t-test. a–h, j–m Representative
  images from more than three independent experiments. Source data are provided as
  a Source Data file.'
