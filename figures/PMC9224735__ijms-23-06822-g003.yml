caption: 'CircDCLRE1C could serve as a sponge for miR-214b-3p to regulate the expression
  of STAT3: (A,C) The potential binding site sequence (highlighted in red) of miR-214b-3p
  on circDCLRE1C or STAT3, and the model of interaction between miR-214b-3p and circDCLRE1C
  or STAT3, modeled by RNAhybrid software. (B,D) Dual-luciferase assay verifying the
  binding relationship between miR-214b-3p and circDCLRE1C or STAT3, respectively.
  (E) The mRNA level of STAT3 in HD11 cells with circDCLRE1C overexpression and knockdown,
  as measured by qRT-PCR. (F) The mRNA level of STAT3 in HD11 cells with miR-214b-3p
  mimics and inhibitors. (G) The mRNA level of miR-214b-3p in HD11 cells with circDCLRE1C
  overexpression and knockdown. (H) The increased expression of STAT3 in HD11 cells
  with circDCLRE1C overexpression could be rescued by mi-214b-3p. (I,J) CircDCLRE1C
  was pulled down by the biotin-miR-214b-3p probe, as detected by gel electrophoresis
  and qRT-PCR. The relative levels were normalized to the input. Data are presented
  as means ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).'
