caption: Origins and heterogeneity of CAFs in the TME. A. Schematic representation
  of CAF origins. CAFs can originate from diverse cell populations through different
  mechanisms. Local sources of CAFs include activated tissue resident fibroblasts,
  trans-differentiated endothelial cells resulting from EndMT, and de-differentiated
  pericytes, adipocytes, or stellate cells. Beyond those local sources, more distant
  ones can be involved in CAFs recruitment/differentiation in the TME, especially
  MSCs; B. schematic representation of CAF subsets. Distinct subpopulations of CAFs
  have been described with the TME. The combined analysis of six CAF markers (FAP,
  CD29, αSMA, FSP1, PDGFRβ, and CAV1) in breast and ovarian cancer leads to the identification
  of CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 subtypes. CAF-S1 displays an immune-suppressive function, CAF-S4
  promotes invasion and metastasis formation and CAF-S2/-S3 resembles normal fibroblasts.
  More recently, single-cell RNA sequencing allowed the description of two different
  subsets of the CAF-S1 population, referred to as myCAF and iCAF. Within these two
  populations, IL-iCAF (IL-signaling), IFNγ/ap-iCAF (IFNγ-related/antigen presenting
  pathway), detox-iCAF (detoxification pathway), ECM-myCAF (ECM proteins), TGFβ-myCAF
  (TGFβ-dependent pathway), wound-myCAF (wound-healing signaling), IFNα/β-myCAF (IFNα/β-related
  pathway) and acto-myCAF (acto-myosin signaling) have been identifiedNote. Adapted
