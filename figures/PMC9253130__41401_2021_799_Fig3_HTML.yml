figure_title: ADT-OH suppresses melanoma cells migration in vitro
caption: a–c Melanoma cell lines B16F10, B16F1 and A375 were seeded into six-well
  plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After incubation with ADT-OH at 0 μM (control), 6.3 μM,
  12.5 μM, 50 μM for 24 h, the effect of ADT-OH on cell migration was measured by
  wound-healing assay; original magnification ×40. d–f The migration rates of B16F10,
  B16F1 and A375 cells were calculated by the formula shown in Materials and Methods.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.005, ****P < 0.001 compared with vehicle group.
