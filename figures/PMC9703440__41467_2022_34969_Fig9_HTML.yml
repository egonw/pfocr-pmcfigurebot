figure_title: The p38α-BLIMP1 signal axis is required for LPS-induced PC generation
caption: a Naive B cells from the spleen of p38αfl/flVavcre or p38αfl/fl mice were
  stimulated with LPS for 4 days (n = 6 per group). The percentage of iPCs (CD19+CD138+)
  was analyzed by flow cytometry. b Cultured p38α KO and WT B cells were transduced
  with retroviruses encoding p38α or p38α kinase-dead mutants (K53M or T180A/Y182F)
  at day 1 of LPS-induced iPCs generation. iPCs among retrovirus-infected B cells
  (CD19+GFP+CD138+) were analyzed by flow cytometry 3 days after retroviral transduction
  (n = 6 per group). c Flow cytometry analysis of BLIMP1-expressing cells (CD19+GFP+),
  BLIMP1-expressing CD138− B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138−) and BLIMP1-expressing iPCs (CD19+GFP+CD138+)
  differentiated from cultured p38αfl/flVavcreBlimp1gfp/+ and p38αfl/flBlimp1gfp/+
  B cells stimulated with LPS and MFI of GFP (indicating Blimp1 expression) in BLIMP1-expressing
  cells, GFP+CD138− B cells and iPCs (n = 4 per group). d Cultured p38α KO and WT
  B cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding BLIMP1, TCF3 (E12 or E47), TCF4,
  or IRF4 at day 1 of LPS-induced iPCs generation. iPCs among retrovirus-infected
  B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) were analyzed by flow cytometry 3 days after retroviral
  transduction (n = 6 per group). Data were representative of at least three independent
  experiments. Each symbol represents a representative sample. Small horizontal lines
  indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
