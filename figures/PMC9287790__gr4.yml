caption: Abi1 depletion downregulates WAVE2 and inhibits Akt and Lyn pathways in Bcr-Abl
  positive leukemic cells. A. Downregulation of WAVE2 in Abi1-depleted K562 cells.
  Total lysates from 1 × 106 control K562 (K562 ctrl) and three independent clones
  of Abi1-depleted K562 cells (K562 KO B4, E4, and E3) were analyzed by western blot
  using indicated antibodies. B. Depletion of Abi1 in p185Bcr-Abl cells (left panel)
  and K562 cells (right panel) reduces Lyn activation. Total lysates from 1 × 106
  p185Bcr-Abl control cells (p185 ctrl), K562 control cells (K562 ctrl), two independent
  clones of Abi1-depleted p185Bcr-Abl cells (Abi1 KO2.3 and Abi1 KO6.2), and two independent
  clones of Abi1-depleted K562 (K562 KO B4 and KO E4) were analyzed by western blot
  using indicated antibodies. C. Abi1 knockout in K562 cells inhibits the activation
  of Akt pathway. Total lysates from 1 × 106 K562 control (K562 ctrl) and three clones
  of Abi1-depleted K562 cells (K562 KO B4, KO E4 and KO E3) were analyzed by western
  blot using indicated antibodies.
