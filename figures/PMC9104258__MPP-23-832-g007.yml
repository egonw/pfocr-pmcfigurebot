caption: Ubp3 regulates the ubiquitination of Smo1. (a) UBP3 deletion mutant increased
  in total protein ubiquitination level compared to the wild type (WT). (b) Yeast
  two‐hybrid analysis confirmed protein–protein interactions between Ubp3 and Smo1.
  Cultures of AH109 yeast cells containing plasmids encoding different combinations
  of prey (AD) and bait (BD) vectors were grown on selective (SD−Leu−Trp−His) plates
  and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. The vectors BD‐53/AD‐T and BD‐Lam/AD‐T were expressed
  in yeast as positive and negative controls, respectively. A cyclic depsipeptide
  antibiotic aureobasidin A (AbA) was added to the −Leu−Trp−His plate to inhibit autoactivation.
  LacZ autoactivation was observed when Smo1 was cloned on the BD vector and Ubp3
  was cloned on the AD vector. (c) Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses between Ubp3 and
  Smo1. In proteins eluted from anti‐green fluorescent protein (GFP) beads, the FLAG:Smo1
  band was also detected in the transformant expressing the GFP‐Ubp3 construct by
  anti‐FLAG antibody. (d) Ubiquitination level of Smo1 in the wild‐type P131 and Δubp3
  strains expressing FLAG‐Smo1. Total proteins were used in a pulldown assay with
  anti‐FLAG M2 beads and the ubiquitination level of Smo1 was detected with anti‐ubiquitin
  antibodies. (e) Protein level of FLAG:Smo1 in mycelia treated with or without MG132,
  a potent cell‐permeable proteasome inhibitor. (f) Phosphorylation level of mitogen‐activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) and protein kinase A (PKA) in the wild‐type P131 and Δubp3
  strains. Total proteins were separated in a phospho‐tag gel by electrophoresis and
  western blotting was performed with anti‐p44/42 antibody or anti‐phosPKA antibody,
  respectively. (g) UBP3 expression at stages of hyphae, conidia, appressoria, and
  infectious hyphae. HY, hyphae; CO, conidia; 3H AP, appressorium at 3 h; 12H AP,
  appressorium at 12 h; 18H IH, infectious hyphae at 18 h; 24H IH, infectious hyphae
  at 24 h; 48H IH, infectious hyphae at 48 h. (h) Regulatory model of Ubp3. Model
  for the potential regulatory mechanism of Ubp3 in de‐ubiquitinating Smo1 and in
  the Ras2 signalling pathway
