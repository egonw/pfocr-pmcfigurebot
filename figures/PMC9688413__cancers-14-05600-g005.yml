caption: Cross-species analysis of NE to non-NE progression of human and mouse SCLC
  tumors. (A) Pseudotime trajectory of murine SCLC single cell RNA-seq data shows
  the ordering of cells from early to late time points (Day 4 to Day 21). Black arrow
  shows an increase in pseudotime. (B) Cell abundance is plotted according to pseudotime
  and segregated cells harvested early (Days 4–7) and late (Days 11–21). (C,D) Similarly,
  the trajectory of human SCLC tumor epithelial cells and cellular abundance along
  the pseudotime are plotted. Black arrow shows an increase in pseudotime. (E) A heatmap
  shows the correlation in gene expression between human SCLC epithelial cells (x-axis;
  81 samples) and mouse single cells (y-axis, 19,366 cells), both sorted in order
  of pseudotime. NE scores representing the transcriptional shift from NE to non-NE
  decreased consistently with pseudotime. (F) Levels of expression (y-axis, log2-scaled)
  are shown for NE and EMT markers as well as those belonging to Hippo/YAP1 and Notch/REST
  signaling pathways. Dashed lines in the Notch signaling pathway indicate Notch-inhibitory
  genes.
