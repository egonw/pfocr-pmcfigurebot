caption: Characterization of UCMSCs. (A) In vitro culture, MSCs showed a spindle-shaped
  fibroblastic morphology (×100). (B) Using flow cytometry, these cells were positive
  for CD73, CD90, and CD105, and negative for CD34, CD45, and CD14. (C) Under 2-week
  adipogenic induction, differentiation into adipocytes was achieved (Oil red O staining,
  ×100). (D) Under 2-week osteogenic induction, differentiation into osteocytes was
  achieved (von Kossa staining, ×100).
