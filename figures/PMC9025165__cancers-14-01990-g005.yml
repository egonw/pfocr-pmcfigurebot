caption: SRSF6 expression in normal samples promotes pro-apoptotic signaling and immune
  cell activation. (A) Based on differential gene expression analysis (R DESeq2),
  we identified significant expression changes between SRSF6-high and -low colon samples.
  Log2 fold changes and −log 10-adjusted p-values of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) are shown on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. (up- and down-regulation
  were colored red and blue based on fold changes, respectively) (B) We performed
  pathway enrichment analysis of significantly up-regulated DEGs and identified immune
  cell activation among SRSF6-high normal samples (hypergeometric tests p-values <
  0.01). The top 10 enriched pathways are shown with their respective statistical
  significances (i.e., −log 10 p-value).
