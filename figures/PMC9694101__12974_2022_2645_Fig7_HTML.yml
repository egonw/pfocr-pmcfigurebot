caption: The p38/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway mediated the miR-26a-3p deficiency-induced neuronal
  dysfunction. A Immunofluorescent staining showed Iba-1-positive microglia. B The
  number of Iba-1-positive microglia within the hippocampal region was decreased after
  daily treatment with SB203580 for 2 weeks in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. C The microglia
  showed the resting states after the daily treatment with SB203580 for 2 weeks in
  miR-26a-3p deficiency rats. D SB203580 treatment reduced the increased phosphorylated
  level of p65 and expression level of NLRP3 induced by knock-down of miR-26a-3p.
  E–G SB203580 treatment reduced the increased level of IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ induced
  by knock-down of miR-26a-3p. H, I SB203580 treatment has increased levels of IL-4
  and IL-10 reduced by knock-down of miR-26a-3p. J Raw traces of sEPSC by patch-clamp
  recordings. K SB203580 treatment reversed the decreased amplitude of sEPSC. L SB203580
  treatment reversed the decreased frequency of sEPSC. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs.
  N = 6–8 per group. For electrophysiological recordings, N = 6 neuros from 4 rats
  per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
