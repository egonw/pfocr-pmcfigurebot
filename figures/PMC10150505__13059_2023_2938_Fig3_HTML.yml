caption: Short-term caloric restriction alters the transcriptome and modulates bile
  acid profile in liver. A Volcano plots of differentially expression genes (|fold
  change|> 2) between AL and CR groups (n = 4 per group). B,C GO and KEGG pathway
  analysis of differentially expression genes (both up and down) induced by AL or
  CR (n = 4 per group). D–F Heatmap of key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis,
  fatty acid β-oxidation, or in bile acid secretion (n = 4 per group). Each column
  contains data from an individual study animal and each row represents a gene. G
  OPLS-DA analysis of liver metabolites between AL and CR groups (n = 9–10 per group).
  H Volcano plots of differentially expression metabolites (|fold change|> 2) between
  AL and CR groups (n = 9–10 per group). I Metabolic enrichment pathway analysis based
  on the identified differentially expression metabolites. J OPLS-DA analysis of hepatic
  targeting bile acid metabolomics between AL and CR groups (n = 9–10 per group).
  K Volcano plots of differential bile acids (|fold change|> 2) between AL and CR
  groups (n = 9–10 per group). L Six identified bile acids selected by variable importance
  for the projection (VIP) between AL and CR groups (n = 9–10 per group, VIP > 1,
  p < 0.05). M Heatmap of six identified differential bile acids between AL and CR
  groups (n = 9–10 per group, VIP > 1, p < 0.05). N–S Relative concentrations of differential
  representative bile acids between AL and CR groups (n = 9–10 per group). Multiple
  testing correction was calculated. * FDR < 0.1, ** FDR < 0.05, *** FDR < 0.01 and
  **** FDR < 0.001 were determined statistically significant
