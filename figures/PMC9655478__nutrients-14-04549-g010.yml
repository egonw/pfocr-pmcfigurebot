caption: The schematic illustration of underlying mechanism of L-cit alleviating oxidative
  damage and immune dysfunction. As a result, L-cit alleviates thymus histological
  damage, reduces the iron deposition, improves antioxidative capacity, and restrains
  NF-ÎºB pathway in the mouse thymus and mTEC1 cells. NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy
  and ferroptosis were attenuated. L-cit might target ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis
  to decrease iron deposition and exert antioxidation and anti-inflammation response,
  which could be a therapeutic strategy against iron overload-induced oxidative damage
  and immune dysfunction.
