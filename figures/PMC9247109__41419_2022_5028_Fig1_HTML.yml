figure_title: DHODH inhibition induces apoptosis in CML
caption: A represents the positive cell percentage of Annexin V/PI subsets. The results
  were obtained in newly diagnosed CML CD34+ (n:6) patients’ cells after treatment
  with various concentrations of Meds433 for 3 days. Also, flow cytometry graphs of
  one treated CML CD34+ cells are shown in the A right panel. B represents the effect
  of Meds433 on resistant CML CD34+ cells (n:4) which is shown by the positive cell
  percentage of Annexin V/PI subsets. C demonstrates apoptosis induction that is shown
  by positive cells’ percentage of Annexin V/PI subsets after treatment of K562 and
  CML-T1 with different concentrations of Meds433 and BQ for 3 days (n:3). D shows
  Western blot analysis of PARP1 and Caspase 3 after treatment of K562 and CML-T1
  with 100 nM Meds433 for 3 days (n:3). E shows uridine level based on RLU in the
  cell lysate of K562 cells after treatment with 100 nM Meds433 for 2 and 3 days (n:3).
  RLU inversely correlates with the uridine level in cells. F displays the kinetic
  of apoptosis after treatment of K562 and CML-T1 with 100 nM Meds433 (n:3). G represents
  uridine rescue that was measured using Annexin V/PI in K562 and CML-T1 after the
  addition of exogenous uridine at the concentration of 100 µM (n:3). The addition
  of uridine activates the salvage pyrimidine pathway and hampers activation of the
  de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001,
