caption: Venn diagram and bar charts for proteins identified using X! Tandem and Mascot.
  Venn diagrams (A) are used to show that a total of 1851 proteins were originally
  identified, of which 888 were common to both control (atrophic) and endometrial
  cancer (cancer) samples. Only 300 proteins were found solely in the control tissues,
  and 663 were only found in the cancer tissues. After close examination of the peptide
  identities, 4 proteins were duplicated in the cancer tissues and so were eliminated
  from further analyses (second Venn diagram). Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis
  of the 663 proteins found only in endometrial cancer matched the genes identified
  to 21 biological processes (B) and to 8 molecular functions (C). The % of genes
  in each category is indicated.
