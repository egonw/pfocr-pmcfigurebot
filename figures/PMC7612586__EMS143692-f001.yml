figure_title: Lactate reprograms lipid metabolism in PCa
caption: 'a) Levels of lactate, citrate, palmitate, stearate and cholesterol were
  measured in prostate carcinomas (PCa) and benign hyperplasia (BPH) (n=5). Data represent
  means ± SEMs. Student’s t test; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 b) MCT1 expression
  in representative tissue cores from TMA (n=63, magnification 20X) including benign
  and tumor tissue samples with low (< 3) and high Gleason grade (≥3). Box-and-whiskers
  plots of MCT1 histoscores in tissue samples compared by Gleason grade. On the right,
  Oil Red staining and quantification in representative PCa and benign tissues (n=5,
  scale bar: 50μm, magnification 40X). c) Correlation analysis between ACLY/SREBF2
  and MCT1 expression in primary tumor specimens of Taylor dataset. Each dot corresponds
  to an individual specimen. Pearson correlation r. d) Differential gene expression
  analysis between lactate-exposed (15 mM for 48h) and untreated (serum-starved) DU145
  cells. The grey dots represent all the considered genes. Red and blue dots highlight,
  respectively, the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the “lipid metabolic
  process” gene ontology pathway over a 0.5 |log2FC|, considering a p-value cut-off
  equal to 0.05. e) Enrichment plots of the Hallmark Cholesterol homeostasis and EMT
  pathways showing a positive association between these MSigDb datasets and the Lactate-exposed
  DU145 gene expression profile. NES, normalized enrichment score. f) DU145 cells
  were subjected to 14C lactate-containing medium, upon pre-exposure with HPF- or
  CAFCM and 15mM lactate, with or without AR-C155858 (iMCT1) inhibitor (40μM). Radioactive
  extracted lipids are shown. g) 13C-labeled lactate-derived fluxes and relative incorporation
  of 13C carbons derived from lactate in TCA cycle intermediates and palmitate in
  DU145 cells exposed to HPF- or CAF-CM and lactate (15mM). 13C carbons derived from
  lactate in citrate and palmitate in DU145 cells treated as indicated ± AR-C155858.
  h) Cholesterol steady-state levels detected in DU145 cells treated as indicated,
  ± AR-C155858. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  Significance was determined one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple-comparison analysis;
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
