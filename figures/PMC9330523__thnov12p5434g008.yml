caption: 'SOX9 requires the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to drive renal tubule repair and
  regeneration after AKI. (A) GSEA of Sox9-responsive genes showing enrichment of
  the WNT signaling pathway in tubular epithelial cells. Normalized enrichment score
  (NES) = 1.00. (B) Relative expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-associated genes
  in siSox9 treated mouse primary renal tubular epithelial cells after H/R. (C-D)
  Representative immunofluorescence staining of β-catenin (red) (C) and quantitative
  detection of the β-catenin fluorescence intensity (D) in different groups after
  H/R in TCMK1 cells showing increased expression and nuclear translocalization of
  β-catenin after Sox9 overexpression. n = 4 per group. Scale bars: 100 µm. (E) Relative
  expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-activated genes (Cyclin D1 and cMyc) in Sox9-overexpressing
  (Sox9CMV-OV) and ICG001-treated TCMK1 cells after H/R. n = 3 per group. (F) CCK-8
  assay of TCMK1 cells subjected to different treatments. n = 5 per group. (G) The
  schematic diagram showing the results of the whole study. After ischemic or nephrotoxic
  AKI, tubular epithelial cells are injured, some cells die, and some cells highly
  express EGR1. Overexpression of EGR1 increases SOX9 expression by binding the Sox9
  gene promoter, and then SOX9+ renal tubular cells regeneration, thereby alleviate
  tubular injury and promote kidney recovery. ns, no significant; *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001. H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; AKI, acute kidney injury; siCon,
  negtive control siRNA; siSox9, Sox9-specific small interfering RNA; Sox9OV, Sox9-overexpression
  plasmid; ICG001, a Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor; GSEA, Gene set enrichment analysis;
  CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.'
