figure_title: GPX4 physically interacts with the TAK1-TAB complex
caption: 'A A partial list of interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry
  using cells stably expressing GPX4. The unique and total peptide numbers for the
  indicated proteins are shown. B Representative peptides of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB3.
  C 293 T cells transfected with empty vector control or Flag-GPX4 for 48 h were subjected
  to the co-IP assay. D Representative immunofluorescence images showing the colocalization
  of GPX4 and the indicated genes in CNE2 cells. E Schematic diagram showing the structure
  of the TAK1 protein and the designs of different truncations for domain mapping.
  F 293 T cells transfected with Flag-GPX4 and full-length or truncated myc-TAK1 for
  48 h were subjected to a co-IP assay. G Purified GPX4 proteins were precipitated
  with GST-vector, GST-TAK1 1-606aa, or GST-TAK11-305aa proteins and detected by immunoblotting
  using anti-GPX4 antibody. GST-fusion proteins were detected by Coomassie blue staining.
  H 293 T cells transfected with the vector control or Flag-GPX4 and myc-TAK1 expression
  plasmids for 48 h were subjected to co-IP assay. I Analysis of the TAK1-NFκB/MAPK
  signaling pathway in the indicated stable cell lines by immunoblotting. mock, no
  shRNA; Ctrl, negative control shRNA. J Representative immunofluorescence images
  of NFκB (p65) and p38 in GPX4 knockdown or control CNE2 EBV-positive cells. shCtrl,
  negative control shRNA. Data are representative of three biologically independent
  experiments. D and J Scale bars: 20 µm.'
