caption: 'Oleic acid was evaluated for the transcription level of fat and cholesterol
  metabolic pathways on the hepatic steatosis model. LMH cells were treated as described
  in Figure 5. Total RNA was prepared for transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase
  chain reaction, and quantitative PCR was performed to characterize fat and cholesterol
  metabolic pathway gene expression. P < 0.05 *, P < 0.01 **, P < 0.001 ***, P < 0.0001
