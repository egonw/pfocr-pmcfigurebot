caption: Saliency detection model of LGN and Area 21a. A, Fitting result of population
  trained response change ratio curve of LGN neurons, using the smoothing spline method.
  Black circles indicate experimental data, and red curve indicates fitting result.
  B, Same as A of Area 21a neurons. C, Saliency maps of LGN during the detection phase
  of dynamic visual inputs; each sample consists of two parts, the left part is visual
  input, and the right part is the corresponding saliency map. Duration of each stimulus
  is 0.5 s with a 0.5 s blank interval. D, Same as C of Area 21a. Full video can be
  found in  and . It is notable that in C and D, the detection phase followed a 100
  s initial phase, so the detection phase started from 100 s.
