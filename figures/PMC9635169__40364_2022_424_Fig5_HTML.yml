caption: Low miR-637 expression in tumor tissues is associated with poor pathological
  features and overall survival of ESCC patients. A The relative expression of miR-637
  was examined by qRT-PCR from paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 49 ESCC
  patients. B-D Decreased expression levels of miR-637 in tumor tissues correlate
  with advanced TNM stage (B), poor differentiation (C), and lymph node metastasis
  (D), respectively. E Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for overall survival was performed,
  comparing the relatively low and high miR-637 expression groups of ESCC patients.
  Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
article_title: Loss of miR-637 promotes cancer cell stemness via WASH/IL-8 pathway
  and serves as a novel prognostic marker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
