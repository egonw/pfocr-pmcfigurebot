caption: Differentially expressed genes and signalling pathways influenced by CDO1
  in two BC cell lines. (A) Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes
  in BC cells with or without CDO1 overexpression. (B) Venn diagram illustrating the
  overlapping upregulated and downregulated DEGs in two BC cell lines stably expressing
  CDO1. (C) Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways for the differentially abundant genes
  induced by CDO1 in two BC cell lines stably expressing CDO1. Representative protein
  gel bands of the PI3K‐AKT signalling pathway (D), p53 pathway (E), and cell cycle
  pathway (F) in two BC cell lines stably expressing CDO1. All raw immunoblots are
  included in Supporting Information Figure . (G) Relative intensity of CDO1, PTEN,
  p‐PI3K, PI3K, p‐AKT, AKT, p‐P53, P53, Bcl‐2, Bax, PUMA, CDC25A, Cyclin A1, p‐CDK2,
  CDK2 and Cdc6 in two BC cell lines stably expressing CDO1. (H) mRNA levels of GADD45A,
  L1CAM and GPX4 in two BC cell lines stably expressing CDO1. Data are presented as
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ns p > .05, *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001,
  ****p < .0001. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t‐test (two‐sided).
