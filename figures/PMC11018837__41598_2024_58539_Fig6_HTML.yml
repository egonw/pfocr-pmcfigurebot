caption: RACGAP1 knockdown inhibited cell growth in A549 cells. A549 cells were transfected
  with si-Ctrl or three independent siRNAs for si-RACGAP1. (a) Protein levels of RACGAP1
  were determined using Western blot analysis. Representative images of RACGAP1 and
  β-actin are shown and quantitated using ImageLab software. β-actin was used as an
  internal control. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl. (b) Cell viability was determined using
  the CCK-8 assay. Data were normalized to the viability on day 1 and are represented
  as fold change. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl. (c) The colony formation assay was used to
  determine cell survival. After obtaining the images, colony formation was calculated
  and normalized to the survival of control cells. *P < 0.05 vs. si-Ctrl.
