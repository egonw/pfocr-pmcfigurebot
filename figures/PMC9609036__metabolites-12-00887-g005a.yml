caption: (A) Response mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone and flavonol
  pathways in quinoa seeds during different developmental periods. Red and green represent
  upregulated and downregulated genes/metabolites, respectively. (B) The boxes in
  the pathway represent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or differentially accumulated
  metabolites (DAMs). CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3−hydroxylase; CHS,
  chalcone synthase; PGT1, phlorizin synthase; HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase;
  CYP75B1, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; FG2, flavonol−3−O−glucoside L−rhamnosyltransferase;
  FG3, flavonol−3−O−glucoside/galactoside glucosyltransferase.

  Stages.
