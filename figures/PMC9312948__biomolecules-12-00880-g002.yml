caption: Potential mechanisms of TRAP1 participation in metabolic rewiring. (a) TRAP1
  binds to and inhibits electron transport chain (ETC) complexes II and IV in the
  mitochondria. TRAP1 interacts with protein deacetylase SIRT3 in mitochondria and
  is reported to inhibit cyclophilin D (CypD), thereby preventing permeability transition
  pore (PTP) opening and inhibiting apoptosis due to cytochrome c release. (b) Further,
  TRAP1 activity is enhanced by phosphorylation via several pathways. Note that it
  remains unclear whether this happens before or after mitochondrial import of TRAP1.
  (c) ETC complex II inhibition by TRAP1 leads to succinate accumulation, which in
  turn inhibits prolyl hydroxylases in the cytosol to stabilize HIF1α. Stabilized
  HIF1α and Myc together activate a pseudo-hypoxic program, which further upregulates
  TRAP1 gene expression. (d) Inside mitochondria, TRAP1 also binds to ETC complexes
  I, III, and V (ATP synthase), but with unknown effects. (e) While TRAP1 tetramers
  exist alongside TRAP1 dimers in the mitochondrial matrix, determinants of the ratio
  of dimer to tetramer and any functional significance remain enigmatic. (f) TRAP1
  presence and absence affect mitochondrial carbon preference. TRAP1 KO cells downregulate
  glucose- and pyruvate-derived carbon entry into the TCA cycle. A significant proportion
  of glucose is diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) where it is used for
  the synthesis of NADPH reducing equivalents, perhaps to counter increased reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) that are characteristic of TRAP1 KO cells, and for the synthesis
  of ribose sugars. Pyruvate, upon decarboxylation, normally enters the TCA cycle
  and contributes to formation of acetyl-CoA, an important TCA cycle intermediate.
  In glycolysis, pyruvate is preferentially metabolized to lactate, generating NAD+
  as a by-product of the reaction, at the expense of NADH. As with NADPH, increased
  levels of NADH provide more reducing equivalents to counter the increased ROS characteristic
  of TRAP1 KO. In contrast, TRAP1 KO cells utilize anaplerotic glutamine metabolism
  to maintain a functional TCA cycle by providing glutamine-derived carbon.
