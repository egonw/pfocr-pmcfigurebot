caption: Activation of Wnt signaling pathway by cpd1. (a) Reporter analysis using
  HEK293 TOP flash cell line for measuring activities of GSK3β inhibition on hit compounds.
  CHIR99021 is a GSK3β inhibitor and used for positive control. Data are mean ± SEM
  (n = 3). p-value by one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s multiple comparisons) test. (b) An activation
  curve for determining the EC50 of cpd1 for TOP flash activity. Data are mean ± SEM
  (n = 3). p-value by one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s multiple comparisons) test. *** p < 0.001.
