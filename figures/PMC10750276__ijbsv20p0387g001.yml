caption: KLF7 is significantly upregulated in COAD. (A) The heatmap displays the fold
  changes in mRNA expression levels of KLF family members between COAD tumors and
  normal colon tissues, as obtained from the GEO and TCGA data sets. (B-D) mRNA expression
  of KLF7. The KLF7 expression in paired COAD and adjacent normal tissues from TCGA
  (B) and in COAD with different clinical stages from TCGA (C) and GEPIA (D) were
  analyzed. (E, F) Survival analysis using the GEPIA database. (G) Representative
  IHC staining images of COAD tissue microarrays. Tumor (up) and normal mucosa (down)
  from the same patient were presented. (H) IHC staining of KLF7 in the paired COAD
  samples. (I) KLF7 protein was determined for five-paired COAD samples by Western
  blot(n=5). (J, K) mRNA expression of KLF7 in paired COAD samples (J) (n=30), as
  well as three pooled normal colon tissues and COAD cell lines (K) (n=3). Pooled
  normal colon tissues were used as control. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01 and ***P< 0.001.
