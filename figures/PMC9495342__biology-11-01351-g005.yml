caption: ANP causes hyperpolarization of cultured vascular endothelial cells in a
  K+ channel-dependent manner via the GC-A–PKG1 signaling pathway. (A) ANP significantly
  decreased the membrane potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
  compared with that in the human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs). Changes
  in the membrane potential were evaluated by monitoring the cellular fluorescence
  intensity. Values are expressed relative to the intensity at time 0. * p < 0.05
  vs. HCASMCs. (B) ANP had no effect on the intracellular calcium concentration of
  HUVECs. Fura-2-AM-loaded HUVECs were stimulated with or without ANP, and cellular
  fluorescence was monitored for 120 s. GSK101 (TRPV4 agonist) was used as the positive
  control. * p < 0.05 vs. without Ca2+. (C) Intravenous infusion of ANP (10 μg/kg/min)
  significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with vehicle (saline)
  administration in intermediate/small-conductance KCa (Kcnn4) knockout mice. * p
  < 0.05 vs. vehicle. (D) ANP caused hyperpolarization of cultured HUVECs in a K+
  channel-dependent manner via the NPR1–PKG1 signaling pathway. HUVECs were treated
  with or without ANP (100 nM) or 8-Br-PET-cGMP (PKG1 activator; 200 μM) in the presence
  or absence of a non-selective K+ channel blocker TEA (tetraethylammonium; 10 mM),
  PKG inhibitor (Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS; 200 μM), or PKG1 siRNA for 300 s. * p < 0.05.
  †p < 0.01 vs. vehicle. This figure is a reconstruction of the figure from our original
  article [].
