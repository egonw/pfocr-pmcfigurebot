caption: Effect of hydroxytyrosol on the percentages of inflammation measured in terms
  of nitric oxide (NO) production in Raw264.7 cells when these cells were previously
  stimulated with LPS (0.1 μg·mL−1) and cultured with different concentrations of
  hydroxytyrosol (0–50 μg·mL−1) at 24, 48 and 72 h. The percentage of inflammation
  of the negative control is represented as 100%. The test was performed in triplicate
  (n = 3) for each experimental condition. Capital letters indicate statistically
  significant differences (p < 0.05) in the same experimental condition (e.g., LPS
  (+) & HT (6.65 μg·mL−1)) between the different times studied (24, 48 and 72 h).
  Lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between the different
  experimental conditions for a specific time (e.g., 24 h). LPS, Lipopolysaccharide.
