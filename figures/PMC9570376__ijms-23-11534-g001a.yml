caption: PM2.5 alters the expression of xenobiotic metabolism, inflammatory response,
  oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and cell barrier-related factors. Transcriptome
  analysis with RNA-seq was performed using SZ95 sebocytes treated with PM2.5 (100
  μg/mL) and a control group. The top 20 most prevalent KEGG terms (a) were obtained
  from pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; |fold
  changes| > 2, p-value < 0.05) in SZ95 sebocytes with PM2.5 treatments. Bars represent
  −log10 (p-value). p-values were calculated by modified Fisher’s exact tests. (b)
  RT-qPCR was performed to analyze the mRNA expression of DEGs. (c) The expression
  levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the indicated antibodies.
  The relative expression levels of proteins were quantified using the Image J program.
  (d) IL6 secretion was analyzed by ELISA and normalized to the total protein. Data
  were analyzed by Student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. untreated
  control; n = 3).
