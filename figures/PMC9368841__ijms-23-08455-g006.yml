caption: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of wild-type (WT) and
  OsRACK1B-OX transgenic pollen grains during anther dehiscence stage. (A–C) TEM image
  showing that the WT pollen grain (A) contains a larger number of starch granules
  than OX-1 (B) and OX-2 (C) pollen. (D–F) Higher magnification of the pollen wall
  showing normal pollen wall from the WT (D) and the abnormality of the pollen wall
  in OX-1 and OX-2 mutants (E,F). (D) A higher magnification TEM image of the normal
  pollen wall from (A). (E) A higher magnification image of the defective pollen wall
  from (B). (F) A higher magnification image of the pollen wall from (C). SG, starch
  granules; LP, lipid bodies; Ba, bacula; Ne, nexine; Cyt, cytoplasm; Ex, exine; In,
  intine; Din, defective intine; Pc, pollen coat; Ft, foot layer; Te, tectum; bars
  = 20 µm in (A–C), 1 µm in (D–F).
