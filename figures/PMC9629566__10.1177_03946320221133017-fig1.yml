caption: Prediction of the interaction between niloticin and MD-2 and effect of niloticin
  on cell viability. (a) Chemical structure of niloticin. (b) Binding model for niloticin
  and MD-2 constructed using ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0, which was minimized using an MMFF94x
  force field. (c) Effect of niloticin concentration on cell viability of RAW264.7
  macrophages determined with the MTT assay. (d) Analysis of niloticin interaction
  with MD-2 using a bio-layer interferometry assay. The dissociation equilibrium constant
  in response to niloticin concentration varied over time as 0.0313, 0.0625, 0.125,
  0.25, and 0.5Â mM/mL.
