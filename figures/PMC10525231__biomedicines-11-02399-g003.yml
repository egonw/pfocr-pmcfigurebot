caption: 'Immunological features and pathway characteristics of molecular subtypes.
  (A) Proportions of 22 immune cell types in subtype samples. (B) Differences in immune
  cell scores of 22 immune cell components between subtype samples. (C) Differences
  in enrichment scores of ten pathways associated with tumour abnormalities between
  subtypes. (D) Distribution of immune infiltration scores between subtype samples.
  (E,F) Comparison of the molecular subtypes with six previously identified pan-cancer
  immunophenotypes. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001. ns:
  no significance.'
