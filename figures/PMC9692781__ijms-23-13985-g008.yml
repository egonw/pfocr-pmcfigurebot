caption: TE-NSP neuronal survival at 1-week post-implant. (a) Representative confocal
  reconstruction of an enriched TE-NSP 1-week post-implant labeled via immunohistochemistry
  to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, green). The TE-NSPs maintained their cytoarchitecture
  consisting of distinct cell body and neurite regions, with dopaminergic neurites
  projecting longitudinally within the micro-column. Higher magnification reconstructions
  from demonstrative regions in (a) depict the (b) dopaminergic neuron aggregate and
  (c) robust, aligned TH+ axons. At 1-week in vivo, neuronal survival was found within
  all of the transplanted TE-NSPs; however, no evidence of neuronal survival was found
  within the other transplant groups (solitary aggregates transplanted into the SNpc
  or striatum). Scale bar (a) = 250 µm. Scale bar (b,c) = 50 µm.
