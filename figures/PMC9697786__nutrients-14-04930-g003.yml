caption: 'PLE alleviates intestinal barrier permeability and inhibits LPS-related
  TLR4-MyD88 signaling in the liver. (a) Representative H&E images of the terminal
  ileum in each group of mice (n = 7~9). (b) mRNA expression of ZO-1, claudin-4 and
  occludin in the ileum of each group of mice (n = 7~9). (c) Levels of serum LPS,
  TNFÎ± and IL-6 in each group of mice (n = 7~9). (d) mRNA levels of the TLR4-MyD88
  signaling pathway in the liver of each group of mice (n = 7~9). (e) Protein levels
  of TLR4 and MyD88 in the liver of each group of mice (n = 5). p values were calculated
  using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected using the method described by Benjamini
  & Hochberg, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 indicate a significant difference between
  the two corresponding groups. NFD: treatment with a normal-fat diet; HFD: treatment
  with a high-fat diet; NFD+PLE: treatment with a normal-fat diet and 150 mg/kg polyphenol-rich
  Liupao tea extract; HFD+PLE: treatment with a high-fat diet and 150 mg/polyphenol-rich
  Liupao tea extract.'
