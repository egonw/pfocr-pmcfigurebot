caption: Reduction of INHBB inhibited ADCY1 and impaired decidualization. a HESCs
  were transfected with si-INHBB or si-CTL for 48 h and then treated with 38 nM E2
  (E) and 1 μM MPA (P) for inducing differentiation. HESCs were stimulated with 1 mM
  8-Br-cAMP or 2.5 μM forskolin (cAMP activator) for 12 h before we harvested the
  differentiated HESCs. Intracellular cAMP concentrations determined by cAMP-specific
  ELISA kit. The experiments were performed three times independently, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, using one-way ANOVA. The mRNA levels of PRL (b) and IGFBP1 (c) from
  these groups were examined using RT-qPCR. *p < 0.05, **P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 (n = 3,
  one-way ANOVA). d Prolactin secretion was measured by ELIFA. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01,
  *** P < 0.001 (n = 3, two-way ANOVA). e–g The mRNA levels of INHBB (e), ADCY1 (f)
  and ADCY2 (g) were examined using RT-qPCR. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 (n = 3, one-way
  ANOVA). h Pearson correlation analysis of mid-secretory endometrial protein levels
  of INHBB and ADCY1 mRNA levels (R2 = 0.3785, P = 0.0005) in all samples (n = 28).
