caption: Overexpression of TIPE2 reduces OGD-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis. (A) Western
  blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of TIPE2 in H9c2 cells. (B and
  C) TUNEL staining was used to detect OGD-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Data are
  representative of three independent repeats per experiment. ***P<0.001 vs. plasmid.
  TIPE2, TNF-α-induced protein 8-like protein 2; OGD, oxygen glucose deprivation;
  over-, overexpression.
article_title: TIPE2 protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis
  by decreasing cell autophagy via the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
