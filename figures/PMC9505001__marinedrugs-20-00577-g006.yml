caption: 'Growth and limonene yield in 300 mL batch cultures of the limonene expression
  strains under optimized conditions. Strains were cultivated in 500 mL shake flasks
  containing a 300 mL opt2 medium supplemented with 10 mM isoprenol at 25 °C and 120
  rpm under 16:8 h light: dark conditions, and using 15 mL dodecane as the overlay
  for 7 d. Three biological replicates were used to calculate the limonene yield averages
  and SDs. One-way ANOVA was used for the statistical analyses. Different letters
  (a–d) indicate significant differences (p ≤ 0.05).'
