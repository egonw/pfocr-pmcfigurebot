caption: 'Annexin V and PI staining of AGS and MKN45 cells after evodiamine treatment.
  (A) AGS and (B) MKN45 cells were treated with 10 μM evodiamine for 6, 12, or 24
  h and 1, 5, or 10 μM evodiamine for 24 h, stained with annexin V-FITC and PI, and
  subjected to flow cytometry. Stained cells were analyzed and illustrated on the
  quadrant by CellQuestPro software. Percentage of cells in apoptosis was analyzed
  and illustrated as a graph. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. the apoptotic cells control; # p < 0.05, ## p <
  0.01, and ### p < 0.001 vs. the dead cells control. EVD, evodiamine.'
