caption: Three T-CMs inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR protein phosphorylation levels in liver
  cancer cells. A, Protein expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR and mTOR
  in HepG2 cells after three T-CM treatments was performed by Western blot. B − D,
  The ratio of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR in HepG2 cells by a under grayscale
  analysis was counted. E, Protein expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR
  and mTOR in Bel7402 cells after three T-CM treatments was performed by Western blot.
  F − H, The ratio of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR in Bel7402 cells by
  a under grayscale analysis was counted. Each result was expressed by Mean ± SD with
  four replicates and the lower case letters indicated P < 0.05.
