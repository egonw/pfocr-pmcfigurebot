caption: The RTK-RAS pathway contributes to TCA cycle modulation and ATP production
  in GBM. (A) The proposed mechanistic scheme by which the RTK-RAS pathway reprograms
  the energy metabolism in GBM. (B) Representative western blotting showing the overexpression
  of EGFR-vIII, mutant KrasG12S, and PTRF-EGFP in U87MG cells (cells transduced with
  empty vector or corresponding lentivirus). (C) Direct measurement of the intracellular
  total ATP concentration by bioluminescence after the treatment with AA (25 µM),
  EPIC (20 µM), or EPIC (20 µM) + AA (25 µM) for 48 h (n = 3). (D-E) Representative
  western blotting showing the expression of p21 and Rb and their downstream targets
  after the treatment with AA (25 µM), EPIC (20 µM), or EPIC (20 µM) + AA (25 µM)
  for 48 h (n = 3). The results were normalized to Tubulin with the control group
  as 1. Protein expression was quantified by ImageJ. (F-G) Cell viability and colony
  formation assays were performed, and the numbers of colonies were calculated (n
  = 3). All data are shown as the mean values ± SD, and p values are based on one-way
  or two-way ANOVA. ****p< 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05.
