caption: The co-expressed gene modules were identified by weighted gene co-expression
  network analysis (WGCNA). (a) Heatmap of correlations of expressed genes between
  samples and modules. (b) Co-expression network of the fatty acid synthesis pathway
  in the yellow module. (c) Co-expression network of the fatty acid metabolism pathway
  in the yellow module. For emphasis purposes, the circles representing hub genes
  are artificially enlarged.
