caption: Aberrant metabolomic profiles in thrombin-activated platelets from type 2
  diabetic patients who developed LST. (A) The OPLS-DA plot shows the global metabolomic
  difference between LST (n = 15) and non-LST (n = 15) platelets at the activated
  state. (B) The 200-permutation test confirms the goodness of fit and predictability
  of OPLS-DA. (C) The volcano plot shows the differential abundant pattern of 943
  metabolites between LST and non-LST platelets at the activated state. (D) Effect
  sizes of metabolites in pathways of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, NAD+ biosynthesis,
  glutamine, glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and arachidonic acid metabolism. (E) TCA
  cycle. (F) NAD+biosynthetic pathway. (G) Glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways.
  Blue rectangles indicate metabolites downregulated in LST platelets; red, metabolites
  upregulated in LST platelets; grey, no change or not detected. NR indicates nicotinamide
  riboside; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NAM, nicotinamide; NAMN, nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide; MNAM, methylnicotinamide; 3-HANA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, G-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; F-1,6-BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  GA-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 3-PG; 3-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 6-PGL, 6-phosphonoglucono-lactone; 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  Ru-5-P, ribulose-5-phosphate; R-5-P, ribose-5-phosphate; Xu-5-P, xylulose-5-phosphate;
  E−4-P, erythrose-4-phosphate. (For interpretation of the references to colour in
