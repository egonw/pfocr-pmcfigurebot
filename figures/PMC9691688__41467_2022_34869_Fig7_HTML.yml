figure_title: Signaling pathway of IL-11 in the adipose tissue in osteoblast/osteocyte-specific
  IL-11−/− mice
caption: a Micro-CT scan at L5 level. Pink, viAT; yellow, subAT; blue, lean mass;
  white, vertebral bone, and b quantitative analysis of adipose tissue in IL-11fl/fl
  control and Ocn-Cre;IL-11fl/fl mice on RD or HFD in the presence or absence of WAY-262611,
  a β-catenin agonist and a Dkk1 antagonist. WAY-262611 at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day was
  orally given to mice 3 days a week (4 mg/kg mice/dose on Monday and Wednesday and
  6 mg/kg mice/dose on Friday) starting at the age of 4 weeks to the end of experiments
  at the age of 12 weeks. n = 5. Data are means ± SD. P values are cauculated using
  two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. c Expression of an adipogenic
  gene, Cebpα, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α, a Wnt inhibitor, Dkk2, dickopf2,
  and a Wnt target gene, Axin, in the adipose tissue of IL-11fl/fl control and Ocn-Cre;IL-11fl/fl
  mice on RD or HFD in the presence or absence of WAY-262611 at the age of 12 weeks.
  n = 3. Data are means ± SD. P values are calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test. d Expression of Sost in the bone and the adipose tissue
  in IL-11fl/fl control and Ocn-Cre;IL-11fl/fl mice. n = 6. Data are means ± SD. P
  values are calculated by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. e
  Oil-Red O staining of WT and IL-11Rα−/− C3H10T1/2 cells in an adipogenic medium
  and cultured for 7 days. Representative pictures of three independent experiments.
  Scale bar = 100 μm. f Expression of adipogenic genes, Pparγ and Cebpα, and Wnt inhibitor
  genes, Dkk1, 2, in WT and IL-11Rα−/− C3H10T1/2 cells in an adipogenic medium and
  cultured for 7 days in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL IL-11. n = 3. Data are
  means ± SD. P values are calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test.
