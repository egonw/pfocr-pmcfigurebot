caption: '(a) Diagram of mouse model. Mice were divided into 5 groups: Control group,
  HFD group, Silymarin group, MJM60668 (108) group, and MJM60668 (109) group. The
  HFD, Silymarin, and MJM60668 groups were fed an HFD diet and free water daily. Moreover,
  mice in the Silymarin group were also treated with silymarin at (50 mg/kg), MJM60668
  (108) were treated with L. reuteri at a concentration of 1 × 108 CFU, daily, and
  MJM60668 (109) were treated with L. reuteri at a concentration of 1 × 109 CFU, daily.
  (b) body weight recording weekly for 12 weeks of the experiment. (c) Food intake
  per cage recording weekly. (d) Comparative image with body shape mice before sacrifice.
