caption: 'UGRP1–PDPN signalling activates RhoA to regulate TLR2‐induced inflammation.
  (A) PEMs were transfected with control siRNA, Marco siRNA, Sdc1 siRNA or Pdpn siRNA
  followed by Pam3CSK4 (0.5 μg/ml) stimulation for 6 h with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml)
  treatment and the Il6 mRNA levels were checked using qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (B) PEMs were
  incubated with control IgG or two PDPN antibodies (2 μg/ml) named anti‐PDPN (B‐11)
  or anti‐PDPN (F‐3) for 1 h followed by Pam3CSK4 (0.5 μg/ml) stimulation accompanied
  with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment for 6 h. Il6 mRNA levels were measured by
  qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (C) HA‐Vector or two HA‐tagged PDPN clones suffixed with #1 or
  #2 were transfected into 293T cells respectively with FLAG‐tagged UGRP1 clone. Immunoprecipitation
  and immunoblot were performed with the indicated antibodies. (D) GST protein and
  UGRP1‐GST (2 μg) were incubated with PEMs’ lysate for 2 h followed by incubated
  with GST glutathione agarose for another 2 h. The samples were analysed by immunoblot.
  (E) Cas9‐control and Cas9‐Pdpn‐deficient RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by Pam3CSK4
  (0.5 μg/ml) with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h to measure Il6 mRNA levels by
  qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (F and G) Cas9‐control and Cas9‐Pdpn‐deficient RAW264.7 cells were
  treated with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) for 6h to measure Tlr2 mRNA levels by qRT‐PCR
  (n = 3; F), or for 6 or 9 h to measure NLRP3, NOD2, TLR2, MyD88 and TLR4 expression
  by immunoblot analysis (G). (H) RAW264.7 cells overexpressed PDPN were stimulated
  with Pam3CSK4 (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h with BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment and the
  Il6 mRNA levels were checked using qRT‐PCR (n = 3). (I) PEMs were treated with RhoA
  inhibitor (CCG‐1423, 20 μM), Cdc42 inhibitor (CASIN, 20 μM), Rac1 inhibitor (1A‐116,
  10 μM) or dual Cdc42/Rac1 inhibitor (MBQ‐167, 10 μM) for 1 h followed by Pam3CSK4
  (0.5 μg/ml) and BSA or UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) treatment for 9 h to measure IL‐6 expression
  by ELISA (n = 3). (J) Immunoblot analysis of p65 in the whole cell lysate and nucleus
  in UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) and RhoA inhibitor (CCG‐1423, 20 μM) treated PEMs for 6 h followed
  by Pam3CSK4 (0.5 μg/ml) stimulation for the indicated periods. Tubulin were used
  as the whole lysate protein control, Lamin‐B served as the nucleic protein control.
  (K) PEMs were treated with DMSO control or RhoA inhibitor (CCG‐1423, 20 μM) for
  1 h followed by UGRP1 (0.5 μg/ml) incubation for 6 or 9 h to measure NLRP3, NOD2,
  TLR2, MyD88 and TLR4 expression by immunoblot analysis. (L) Cas9‐control and Cas9‐Pdpn‐deficient
  RAW264.7 cells were treated with DMSO or RhoA activator (Narciclasine, 0.1 μM) for
  1 h followed by UGRP1 and Pam3CSK4 treatment for 6 h to measure Il6 mRNA levels
  by qRT‐PCR (n = 3). *p < .05, **p < .01 and ***p < .001, using two‐way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA) with Holm–Sidak''s multiple comparisons test (A, B, E, F, H,
  I, L). Data from at least three independent experiments (mean ± SD) or representative
  data (C, D, G, J, K). Please also see Figure'
