caption: 'Exploration of the downstream molecular mechanism of poly(A)-specific ribonuclease
  in esophageal cancer cells. A: Human apoptosis antibody array analysis was performed
  in Eca-109 cells transfected with control shRNA or poly(A)-specific ribonuclease
  shRNA; B: Differences in the human apoptotic antibody array were visualized; C:
  Densitometry analysis was performed, and the gray values of differentially expressed
  proteins are shown; D: The expression of the target protein pathway in Eca-109 cells
  was observed by western blot. The data are expressed as the mean Â± SD, aP < 0.05,
  bP < 0.01. sh PARN: Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease shRNA; sh-NC: Control shRNA.'

  and migration of esophageal cancer cells.
