caption: a, The folate pathway is connected to many other pathways critical to the
  survival of a cell, including DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, amino acid homeostasis,
  etc. Small open circles overlaid on arrows denote the presence of multiple steps
  for the indicated metabolic reaction. b–c, Additional checkerboard assays were performed
  to investigate the underlying mechanism of MccJ25‐SMM synergy. Representative results
  from at least three independent experiments (n=3) for each combination are shown.
  b, MccJ25 and SMM showed no synergy in the presence of THF (100 μg/mL). c, MccJ25
  and 5FU show strong synergy (FICIm=0.38).
