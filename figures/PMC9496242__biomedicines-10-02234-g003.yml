caption: Functional capability of genes of intestinal bacteria among three groups
  for KEGG metabolism and pathway enrichment were investigated by PICRUSt method.
  (A) Relative abundance of predicted gene function associated with metabolism. (B)
  Specific pathway modules among three groups. Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied
  to denote variations among groups. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. CKD,
  chronic kidney disease.
