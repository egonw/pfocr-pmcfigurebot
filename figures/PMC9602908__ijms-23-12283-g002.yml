caption: 'Localization observation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65), cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  expression in VP. (A) Immunohistochemical images of p-NF-κB p65, COX-2, TNF-α and
  EGFR of the prostate tissues in the rats treated using BPA, BPAF and PDTC (400×,
  scale bar = 20 μm). Arrows indicate the positive expression. Effect of exposure
  to BPA, BPAF and PDTC on the rate of positive expression of p-NF-κB p65 (B); the
  semiquantitative expression levels of COX-2 (C), TNF-α (D) and EGFR (E) in ventral
  prostate (VP). Results were performed as means ± SD, analyzed using ANOVA followed
  by LSD post hoc test, n = 8. Comparison of the individual administration group and
  the control: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; comparison of the combined administration
  group and the individual administration group: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01.'
