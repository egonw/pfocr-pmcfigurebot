figure_title: Schematic illustration of DHRS2 inhibiting OC growth and invasion by
  regulating choline metabolism
caption: Left, CHKα mRNA is translated to protein, which promotes the activation of
  choline metabolism and AKT pathway, thereby promoting the growth and invasion of
  OC. Right, DHRS2 can directly bind to CHKα mRNA to accelerate its degradation. Correspondingly,
  CHKα protein expression is downregulated, resulting in the disruption of choline
  metabolism and AKT signaling. These effects lead to the inhibition of OC growth
  and metastasis. OC, ovarian cancer.
