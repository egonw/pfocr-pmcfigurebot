caption: A merged enrichment plot from the gene set enrichment analysis, including
  the enrichment score and gene sets. The significantly enriched signaling pathways
  were apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA replication, the MAPK signaling pathway, NOTCH signaling
  pathway, P53 signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, RNA degradation, T-cell receptor
  signaling pathway, TGF-Î² signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling
  pathway.
