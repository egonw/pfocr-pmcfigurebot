caption: Mitochondrial H2O2signalling pathway regulates Phase I detoxification. A)
  N2 (left) and isp-1;ctb-1 (right) animals expressing Grx1-roGFP2. Data shown is
  the ratio between oxidized versus reduced roGFP2. B) Expression levels of pcyp-34a-8::gfp
  in N2 and isp-1;ctb-1 animals upon prdx-3, sod-3 or vdac-1 RNAi. n = 20 animals
  per condition. A, B) Data were normalized to N2 EV and are presented as mean ± SEM.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post
  hoc test. C, D) N2 animals upon prdx-3 RNAi. E, F) isp-1;ctb-1 animals upon vitamin
  C and sod-3 and vdac-1 RNAi. C, E) Worms were transferred on the fourth day of adulthood
  on plates containing 1 mM of levamisole. Animals were assayed every 15 min for movement.
  Failure to move was regarded as paralysed. N = 80 animals per condition. D, F) L1
  animals were grown in liquid with or without 100 μM vinblastine. When untreated
  vinblastine animals reached first day of adulthood, the conditions with vinblastine
  treatment were scored for developmental stages. n = 200 animals per condition. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. ****p < 0.0001, Chi-square test.
