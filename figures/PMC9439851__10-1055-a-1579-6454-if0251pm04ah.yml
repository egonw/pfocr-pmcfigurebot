caption: PA is conjugated to glutathione and compounds of the mercapturic pathway.
  LCMS analysis of intracellular metabolic extracts revealed increased abundance of
  PA following 24 h treatment ( a ) and PA was conjugated with glutathione ( b ),
  cystenylglycine ( c ) and cysteine ( d ). Black is control, dark grey is solvent
  control (EtOH) and light grey is PA. Confirmatory LCMS fragmentation spectra of
  these compounds are afforded in Supplementary Fig. 2S . Statistical analysis of
  detected LCMS features revealed differences to reduced and oxidized glutathione
  ( e and f ) and glutamate ( g ) and proline ( h ). The error bars represent standard
  deviation of all measurements (n = 9). Brackets indicate significant differences
  (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected Welchʼs t-test).
