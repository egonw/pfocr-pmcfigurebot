caption: 'AD-1 inhibits the activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (A, B) The protein
  expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, and Akt was detected by western blot. (C, D)
  CRC cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the effects on PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway were measured. (E, F) CRC cells were pretreated with PI3K activator
  740Y-P, the effects on PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were measured. *: vs. the control
  group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. #:vs. the LY294002 group or 740Y-P group, #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01.'
article_title: Integrating network pharmacology and experimental validation to explore
