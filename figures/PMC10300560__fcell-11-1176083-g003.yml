caption: Identify related lncRNAs and candidate mechanism of radiotherapy response.
  The volcano plot of different expression lncRNAs between radiotherapy resistance
  and sensitive patients (A), the heatmap of different expression lncRNAs between
  radiotherapy resistance and sensitive patients, and AL354754.1 is a key lncRNA and
  could predict radiotherapy response (B,C), and the candidate mechanism of this lncRNA
  may be involved in classical p53 and Wnt signaling pathway (D).
