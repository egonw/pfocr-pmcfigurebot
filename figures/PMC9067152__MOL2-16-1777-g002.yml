caption: The TS pathway does not contribute to GSH synthesis in gliomas. (A) 1H NMR
  spectra of media over time, including assignments for methyl‐13C‐methionine. Representative
  spectra shown as normalized intensities to the trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP)
  signal (δ = 0.00 p.p.m.) and cell number (experiment was done in triplicate for
  each cell line). (B) Methyl‐13C‐methionine levels in cells seeded in medium containing
  this tracer (data displayed as bar plots; mean ± SD, n = 3; ***P < 0.001, two‐tailed
  Student’s t‐test). (C) Representative western blot of CBS and CTH (quantitative
  data for n = 3 is displayed in Fig. A). (D) 13C‐tracing experiments displaying [C3‐13C]‐cysteine
  and [C3,3′‐13C]‐cystine incorporation into cystathionine, glutathione (GSH), and
  hypotaurine (n = 3 samples per cell line and 13C probe, data displayed as bar plots;
  mean ± SD). These experiments were conducted separately for each tracer (13C‐cysteine
  and 13C‐cystine). (E) Percentage of m+1 isotopologue over the total pool of GSH
  from [C3‐13C]‐serine (data displayed as bar plots; mean ± SD, n = 3; *P < 0.5; ***P < 0.001,
  two‐tailed Student’s t‐test). (F) Decrease of GSH levels (data displayed as bar
  plots of Log2(Fold Change, FC), mean ± SD, n = 5; ***P < 0.001, two‐tailed Student’s
  t‐test) for both PAG treatment and cysteine/cystine deprivation displayed.
