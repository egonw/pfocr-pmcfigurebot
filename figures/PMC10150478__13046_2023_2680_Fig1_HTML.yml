caption: 'Identification of TRAF3 as a potential immunomodulator. A Kaplan–Meier plot
  showing the survival of two groups of ITB1-injected mice: pink line—NSG mice and
  cyan line—WT mice. B Schematic representation of library preparation, injection,
  and library DNA isolation. C Volcano plot showing enriched guides in ITB1-injected
  WT mice (pink) compared to ITB1-injected NSG mice (cyan). Guides that are significant
  appear above the horizontal dotted line. D Reactome pathways enriched with the enriched
  guides in the NSG group. The size of the dots represents the number of genes related
  to the pathway, and the color represents the p-value'
article_title: TRAF3 suppression encourages B cell recruitment and prolongs survival
  of microbiome-intact mice with ovarian cancer.
