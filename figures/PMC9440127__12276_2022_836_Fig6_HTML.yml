figure_title: Clinical relevance of CDA expression in NSCLC patients
caption: 'a CDA expression in lung adenocarcinoma tumor (n = 483, from TCGA) and normal
  (n = 347, from GTEx) tissue samples. Each dot represents an expression in a single
  sample. b Overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with low or high CDA
  expression as analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. Median values
  in transcripts per million (TPM) are indicated by solid red and blue lines. The
  highest dotted red line is for a sample with higher expression than the median value
  for the high-expression cohort; the lowest dotted blue line is for a sample with
  lower expression than the median value for the low-expression cohort. HR hazard
  ratio. c EMT scores in lung adenocarcinoma tumor samples with low (n = 257) or high
  (n = 258) CDA expression. d Levels of CDA mRNA (left) and protein (right) assessed
  by qRT–PCR and western blotting of primary cancer cells from ALK-rearranged NSCLC
  patients with acquired resistance to crizotinib. n = 3 independent experiments,
  mean ± SD, **P < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U-test). e Immunohistochemical staining of CDA
  in tumor biopsies from 11 NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements before and/or after
  ALK inhibitor therapy. Left: Boxplot depicting CDA H-score distribution in NSCLC
  patients pretreated (n = 8) or posttreated (n = 8) with TKIs. Right: Representative
  images. f Model for targeting CDA-directed metabolism with 5fdC to overcome resistance
  to ALKis. CDA-overexpressing cells were preexisting in the naïve cell population
  and propagated during acquired resistance. Overexpression of this pyrimidine salvage
  pathway enzyme promotes cell proliferation, migration, and EMT. Epigenome-related
  nucleosides such as 5fdC can induce DNA damage through an accumulation of 5fdU in
  the DNA and ultimately lead to cell death in CDA-overexpressing resistant cells.'

  a potential druggable target for ALK inhibitor–resistant lung cancer therapy.
