caption: The protective effects of ICT on the cerebral ischemia rat. A The experimental
  timeline. B TTC-stained brain sections in the different groups. C Neurological function
  scores (n = 6–8). D The rotating speed in rotarod test. E The time on rod in rotarod
  test (n = 6–8). F and G Degenerating neurons were measured by FJC staining. Green
  fluorescence showed degenerating neurons, and blue fluorescence represented DAPI
  (n = 3), scale bar = 50 μm. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05,
  ***P < 0.001
