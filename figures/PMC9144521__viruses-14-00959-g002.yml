caption: The secondary screening of the hits from the primary screen verifies the
  hits with dose-dependent antiviral activities. Vero cells were incubated with the
  serially diluted hit compounds from the primary screening for 10 min, followed by
  infection with AdV3 or AdV5 for 48 h. The viral replication levels were determined
  by IFA to detect hexon. The inhibition rates were calculated according to the methods
  in the anti-AdV activity assay. The cytotoxicity was measured by a cell viability
  assay using the CellTiter-GloÂ® reagents over the serially diluted hit compounds.
  (A) The hit compound against AdV3 or AdV5 respectively categorizes the number of
  hits targeting each host factor or pathway in the secondary screening. (B) The number
  of hits inhibits both AdV3 and AdV5, targeting each host factor or pathway in the
  secondary screening. The ratio of hit number over the total compound number in each
  category is indicated in parentheses.
