caption: 'CUR enhances autophagy for HUVECs incubated in high glucose conditions.
  (A) The autophagy-related protein expressions were measured with western blotting
  for the Con, HG and HG+CUR groups. (B) The expressions of LC3II/I, Beclin1 and p62
  (after normalization to β-actin) for the three groups. Each error bar is the standard
  deviation of the mean. Significance level between two test conditions: *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01. CUR, curcumin; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Con, control
  group treated with 5.5 mmol/l glucose; HG, high glucose group treated with 33 mmol/l
  glucose.'
article_title: Curcumin activates autophagy and attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis
  in HUVECs through the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway.
