caption: Glutamine metabolic pathway is inhibited in AT2 cells of bleomycin-induced
  fibrosis in mice. (A) Overview of experimental design. AT2 cells from mice treated
  with PBS or bleomycin for 14 days were isolated by FACS to generate a single-cell
  suspension for both scRNA-seq and metabolomics analyses. (B) Expression of glutamine
  metabolite in AT2 cells was downregulated after bleomycin injury. (C) Expression
  levels of Sftpc, Abca3, Gls1, Gpt2 and Suclg1 genes in AT2 cells were decreased
  after bleomycin injury. (D) Top 30 most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms of downregulated
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
