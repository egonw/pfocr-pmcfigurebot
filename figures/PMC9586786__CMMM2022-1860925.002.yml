caption: Expression of VEGFR2. All HIF-1 expression data in this study were entered
  by the author into Excel software, and the statistical processing software was calculated
  by SPSS25.0, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and found by independent samples
  t-test. The number of VEGFR2-positive cells in the cortex increased slightly after
  6 h and 1 d of perfusion. There was no significant difference in the number of VEGFR2-positive
  cells after 6 h and 1d compared with the control group (P > 0.05). However, the
  number of VEGFR2-positive cells increased significantly at 3 d. Compared with the
  control group, there was a significant difference with statistical significance
  (P < 0.05).
