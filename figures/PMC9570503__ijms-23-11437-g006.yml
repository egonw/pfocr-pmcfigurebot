caption: Modulating effect of WISP1v1 on the tumor growth of prostate carcinoma PC-3
  cells. (A, top) PC-DNA and PC-WISP1v1 cells were injected subcutaneously in the
  dorsal area of the four week old male athymic nude mice (n = 5). (A, bottom) Tumors
  from the PC-DNA and PC-WISP1v1 cells were recorded after the mice were sacrificed.
  The volumes of tumor (B) and body weight (C) were measured every 2–3 days during
  a period of 41 days. (D) The tumor weights (±SE; n = 5) were recorded after the
  sacrifice. (E) The mRNA levels (±SE; n = 3) of WISP1, IL-6, CXCL5, and NDRG1 were
  determined by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of WISP1, NDRG1, CXCL5, and β-Actin (±SE;
  n = 3) of the tumors from the PC-DNA and PC-WISP1v1 cells were determined by immunoblot
  assays (F, left). The quantitative analysis was presented as the relative density
  of the target proteins/β-Actin (F, right). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
