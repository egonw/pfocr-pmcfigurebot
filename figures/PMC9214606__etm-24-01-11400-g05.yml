caption: 'Notch1 overexpression reverses the effect of GRWD1 knockdown on triple negative
  breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. (A) The mRNA and (B) protein expression
  of Notch1 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells co-transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1
  was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively.
  ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. ###P<0.001 vs. Ov-NC group. (C) The proliferation
  of MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells co-transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1 was
  determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (D) The protein expression of proliferation-related
  proteins in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells co-transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1
  was detected by western blotting. (E) The proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937
  cells co-transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1 was also determined by Edu staining
  (magnification, x200). (F) The protein expression of apoptosis-related proteins
  in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells co-transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 and Ov-Notch1 was
  detected by western blot analysis. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. #P<0.05
  and ###P<0.001 vs. siRNA-GRWD1 + Ov-NC group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing
  protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression.'
