caption: IL‐6 mRNA and protein expression in kidney tissue. (a) Relative mRNA levels
  for IL‐6. Values for IL‐6 mRNA levels were presented as fold change relative to
  control WT kidneys. Each value represents the mean ± SEM of triplicate combinations
  from 4 mice per group. Data were and analyzed by two‐way ANOVA. a–c means values
  with different letters are significantly different. (b) Representative immunoblots
  of kidney IL‐6 proteins. The protein bands in each lane represent samples from individual
  kidneys. The relative ODs were calculated by normalizing the ODs of IL‐6 to the
  OD for β‐tubulin in the same sample. Data are means ± SEM from 3 mice per treatment
  group. (c) Immunohistochemical staining for IL‐6 in kidney tubules. (d) Immunostaining
  for IL‐6 in renal corpuscles. Ten non‐overlapping fields for tubular and 10 non‐overlapping
  fields of renal corpuscle sections from each kidney were imaged at 60× magnification.
  Relative ODs were quantified (n = 3 mice/group) and analyzed by two‐way ANOVA. A–c
  means values with different letters are significantly different. There was a significant
  increase in IL‐6 mRNA and protein in select tubules in both genotypes (p < 0.01).
  (E) Localization of IL‐6 and KIM‐1 in kidney tubules. Immunofluorescence counterstaining
  of IL‐6 (red) and the proximal tubule marker, villin (green); (F) Co‐localization
  of KIM‐1 (green) and IL‐6 (red). DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei.
