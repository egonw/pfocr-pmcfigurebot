caption: Transcript profiles (A) and RT-PCR data (B) for genes in the anthocyanin
  biosynthetic pathway. Grids with a color-scale from blue to white to red represent
  the gene expression of the DEGs from low to medium to high. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′ hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase.
article_title: Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal the effects of self-
  and hetero-grafting on anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine.
