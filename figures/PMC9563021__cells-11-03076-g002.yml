caption: 'Effect of baicalin on nitric oxide (NO) production (A) and calcium release
  (B) in RAW 264.7 cells. Values are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  Nor, normal group incubated with media only; Con, control group treated with 1 µg/mL
  of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only; BN10, BN25, and BN50 indicate 10, 25, and 50 µM
  of baicalin, respectively; IN, indomethacin (0.5 µM); BA, baicalein (25 µM). # p
  < 0.5 vs. Nor; * p < 0.05 vs. Con; ** p < 0.01 vs. Con.'
