caption: Distribution and regulation of Hedgehog pathway effectors in healthy human
  cornea (left panel) and injured cornea such as following an alkali burn with sodium
  hydroxide (NaOH) (right panel), extrapolating data from animal studies for didactic
  purposes. An upregulation of limbal Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in basal epithelial cells
  and superficial epithelial cells have been evidenced, in association with increased
  Hedgehog pathway effectors such as Patched-1 (Ptch1) around the wound edges and
  increased SHH in the migrating epithelium during corneal wound healing. Finally,
  the role of SHH in the promotion of pathological corneal neovascularization is also
  illustrated. Distribution based on data from Saika et al. 2004 [], Fujita et al.
  2008 [], Fujita et al. 2009 [], Kucerova et al. 2012 [], Hirata-Tominaga et al.
  2013 [], Fan et al. 2019 [], Li et al. 2018 [], Vincente et al. 2018 [].
