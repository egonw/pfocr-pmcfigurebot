caption: Transcriptome profile of PN arrest zygote by single-cell RNA-sequencing.
  (A) 3-D principal-component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptome of human oocytes,
  preimplantation embryos and PN-arrest zygotes. Cells of different preimplantation
  stages form distinct clusters, and PN-arrest zygotes had a specific transcriptome
  character. (B) Scatter plots comparing expression of genes with fold change >2,
  false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. (C) REVIGO scatter plot showing the cluster representatives
  in a 2-D space derived by applying multidimensional scaling to a matrix of semantic
  similarities for the Gene Ontology (GO) terms (biological processes). (D) Metascape
  enrichment network showing intra- and inter-cluster similarities of enriched GO
  terms. Cluster annotations are shown in color code. (E) Comparative analysis of
  genes in the Ca2+ oscillation–CSF–APC signaling pathway by average RNA-sequencing
  of normalized read counts for human PN and PN-arrest zygotes. FDR value, Data are
  mean ± SD. **, p < 0.001; ***, p < 0.0001. (F) Significantly enriched KEGG pathways
  in PN-arrest zygotes; length of column indicates the–log10 p-value.
