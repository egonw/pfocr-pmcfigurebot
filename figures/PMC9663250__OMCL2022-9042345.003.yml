caption: Wnt3a regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. (a) The mRNA expression levels
  of siRNA-Wnt3a in the four groups were detected by qRT-PCR. siRNA significantly
  decreased the expression of the Wnt3a mRNA levels in HFSCs (passage 4). (b) The
  knockdown of Wnt3a decreased the expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (c) pcDNA3.1-Wnt3a
  significantly increased the expression of the Wnt3a mRNA levels in HFSCs (passage
  4). (d) The overexpression of Wnt3a increased the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (e) siRNA-Wnt3a and NC cell proliferation estimated by CCK8 assays after
  24, 48, and 72 h. (f) PcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-Wnt3a cell proliferation was estimated
  by CCK8 assays after 24, 48, and 72 h. (g) Cell apoptosis of the knockdown Wnt3a
  after 3 days. (h) Cell apoptosis of the overexpression Wnt3a after 3 days. ∗P <
  0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
