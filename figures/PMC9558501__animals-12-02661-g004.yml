caption: 'Depicted are representative areas of sections of human carcinomas that are
  stained with hematoxylin–eosin (A–C) and immunolabeled for PD-L1 (A’–C’). Immunostaining
  was performed with PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx for Autostainer Link 48 and DAB as chromogen.
  A (carcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction): The scarce tumor stroma contains
  mild to moderate numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; circle). 20×.
  A’: All tumor cells show linear partial to complete moderate to strong membranous
  staining consistent with constitutive PD-L1 expression through the oncogenic pathway.
  20×. Inset: Shown in greater detail is the membrane staining of tumor cells (black
  arrows). In addition, a few TILs have membranous to cytoplasmic PD-L1 expression
  (green arrows). B (esophageal carcinoma): The tumor stroma is infiltrated with moderate
  TIL numbers (circles). The interface between stroma and tumor cell nests is demarcated
  by arrowheads. An area of necrosis is marked by asterisks. 20×. B’: PD-L1-positive
  immune cells accumulate at the interface between tumor cell nests and stroma (stars).
  The PD-L1 staining of tumor cells is restricted to those that are located at the
  periphery of the tumor cell nests in immediate proximity to the PD-L1-positive immune
  cells (hash signs). This staining pattern is consistent with adaptive induced PD-L1
  expression. 20×. Inset: In higher magnification are depicted aggregates of PD-L1-positive
  immune cells that show a strong membranous to cytoplasmic staining (green arrows).
  The partial to complete membranous staining (usually of a weaker intensity compared
  to the adjacent immune cells) of the cancer cells is marked by black arrows. 40×.
  C (carcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction): The tumor stroma is infiltrated
  by only a few TILs (green arrows). 20× C’: Tumor cells are PD-L1 immunonegative,
  whereas very few immune cells are PD-L1-positive (green arrow). 20×. Inset: The
  PD-L1-positive immune cell (green arrow) is depicted at higher magnification.'
