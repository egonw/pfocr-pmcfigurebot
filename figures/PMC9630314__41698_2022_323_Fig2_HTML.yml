figure_title: B7-H3 is significantly associated with and regulated by AR-signaling
  pathways
caption: a Machine-learning (ML)-based UMAP analysis of the association between B7-H3
  and key PC pathways. Each dot in UMAP represents one gene. The spatial distance
  between two genes represents the similarity of their gene networks. Key PC pathways
  are visualized including AR signaling (green), Cell cycle (blue), Kinases (yellow),
  and Immune markers (purple) along with B7-H3 (pink). b ML-based analysis of the
  gene-network association between B7-H3 and key AR-signaling pathway genes in mCRPC
  patients (SU2C/PCF, n = 208). Data are shown in violin plots, in which red lines
  represent median and blue lines represent first quartile (lower) and third quartile
  (upper). The boundary of the violin represents the range of all data points. The
  degree of overlap of the plots represents the similarity of the networks they are
  associated with. PD-L1 was used as a negative control. c Comparison of H3K27ac enhancement
  at B7-H3 promoter in mCRPC and primary PC from representative patient-derived xenografts
  (PDXs). Pdiff indicates the FDR-adjusted P-value for comparison between primary
  prostate cancer and mCRPC using DESeq2. d Enhanced interaction between B7-H3 distal
  enhancers (green box) and its promoter (red box) in mCRPC as compared to primary
  PC. Top track indicates H3K27ac HiChIP data from LNCaP, which reflects long range
  chromosomal interactions in LNCaP cells. e Binding of AR, FOXA1, and HOXB13 to multiple
  putative B7-H3 enhancer sequences (green box) in mCRPC. f Increased AR binding in
  mCRPC at one of the putative CD276 enhancers indicated in d, labeled with green
  *. Six representative AR ChIP-seq profiles of primary prostate cancer and mCRPC
  are shown.
