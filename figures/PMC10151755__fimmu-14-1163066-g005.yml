caption: Alterations of intracellular Ca2+signalling induced by 2G4. (A) Changes in
  intracellular Ca2+-concentration determined in HaCaT cells, after addition of 2G4,
  AK23 or C-IgG, by a measured change in ratio of 340/380 nm fluorescence of intracellular
  FURA-2AM upon Ca2+ binding (One curve represents one independent experiment, N=3,
  obtained from the mean of 8 cells, n=8). (B) Changes in intracellular Ca2+-concentration
  after addition of 2G4 to HaCaT cells previously treated with inhibitors of the anti-Dsg1-IgG-dependent
  Ca-influx pathway (see ). (C) Representative images of dispase-based dissociation
  assay results after pre-treatment of HaCaT cells with Ca2+-influx pathway mediators
  for 1 h. (D) quantification of the dispase-based dissociation assay results (N=5-13,
  * makrs statistically significant differences between the two conditions indicated,
  n.s. (not significant) indicates, that there are no significant differences to the
  corresponding C-IgG (negative) or 2G4 (positive) control condition, both in two-way-ANOVA
  with Sidaks correction for multiple comparisons, p<0.05). (E) STED images of cells
  pre-treated with vehicle or Ca2+-influx pathway mediators for 1 h and C-IgG or 2G4
  for 24 h. White arrowheads indicate fragmented Dsg3 staining.
