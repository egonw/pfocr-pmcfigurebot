caption: The non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and canonical Wnt signaling pathway
  may play a role in the process of bone nonunion. (A) Western blot electrophoresis
  bands of each protein during the construction of the bone nonunion model. (B) Western
  blot results showed that during the construction of the bone nonunion model, the
  protein expression of β-catenin increased rapidly from 0 to 2 weeks, and gradually
  decreased after 2 weeks. The expression of NLK, RhoA, Rac, and JNK remained unchanged
  in the first 2 weeks, and the protein expression increased from 2 to 12 weeks later.
  The protein expression of SP decreased significantly after 2 weeks of modeling,
  and the difference was significant (*, P<0.05). There was no significant change
  in NPY expression. (C) The qRT-PCR results showed that the mRNA expression of β-catenin
  increased at first and then decreased. The mRNA expression of NLK, RhoA, Rac, and
  JNK had no change in the first 2 weeks, and the protein expression showed an upward
  trend from 2 to 12 weeks later. The mRNA expression of SP was significantly different
  in the first 2 weeks and after 2 weeks (*, P<0.05). The mRNA expression of NPY did
  not change significantly. qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; NLK, nemo-like kinase;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SP, substance P; NPY, Nerve Peptide Y.
