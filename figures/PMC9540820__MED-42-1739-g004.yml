caption: Replication cycle of ZIKV. (1) The E protein on the surface of the ZIKV virus
  particle recognises and binds to receptors on the cell surface. The virus particles
  then enter the cell via clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. (2) Fusion of the endosomal
  membrane and the viral envelope results in the positive‐sense viral RNA being released
  into the cell cytoplasm, where viral replication occurs. (3) Viral replication follows
  the secretory pathway in the host cell, facilitated by the viral nonstructural proteins.
  Viral RNA is translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and viral proteins are
  processed in the Golgi apparatus, where further post‐translational modifications
  such as carbohydrate addition and proteolytic cleavage occur. Viral NS5 protein
  which is the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) synthesises negative‐sense RNA,
  which is in turn used to produce more copies of the viral positive‐sense RNA. (4)
  The viral positive‐sense RNA is packaged into the nucleocapsid core (consisting
  viral proteins synthesised using host cell machinery). (5) The virion then moves
  towards the host cell membrane, where it acquires the membrane envelope and is released
  via exocytosis as a mature virion. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
