caption: Active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment of DEPs in non-HA-CRC. (A)
  Bubble chart of enrichment results of non-HA-CRC, grouped by clusters. The x axis
  denotes the fold enrichment value, while the y axis indicates the significantly
  enriched terms (enrichment threshold =0.05). The bubble size represents the number
  of DEPs in a certain term. The color scale corresponds to the -log10 (lowest-P)
  value. (B) Consolidated active subnetworks of non-HA-CRC. The up- and down- regulated
  DEPs were indicated in red and green, respectively. The Top 5 clusters per p-value
  ranking and their corresponding sub-networks are shown.
