caption: LncRNA Sox2OT targeted miR‐23b and inhibited its expression and activated
  the TLR4/nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) signalling pathway. A and B, target binding
  relations between Sox2OT and miR‐23b (A) and between miR‐23b and TLR4 (B) certified
  by bioinformatics and dual‐luciferase reporter gene assay. C, RIP assay verified
  the interaction between Sox2OT and miR‐23b. (D) The effects on miR‐23b expression
  with silenced Sox2OT measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction RT‐qPCR. E, the TLR4 expression of each treatment group assessed by Western
  blot analysis. The data were shown in mean ± standard deviation, n = 6. Dual‐luciferase
  reporter gene assay was carried out in HEK293T cells, with three replicates. Replicates = 3.
  The t test was used to analyse data in Panels (A)/(B) and one‐way ANOVA was used
  to analyse data in Panels (C)/(D). Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used for
  the ANOVA post hoc analysis. Compared with the sham group, negative control (NC)
  mimic group or lentivirus (LV)‐NC group, **P < 0.01.
