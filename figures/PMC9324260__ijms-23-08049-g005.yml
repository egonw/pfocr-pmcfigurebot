caption: 'Effects of YOH on PDGF−BB-induced cell proliferation and PLCγ1 phosphorylation
  in MOVAS−1 cells with α2B−adrenergic receptor knockdown. We performed α2B−adrenergic
  receptor knockdown by incubating the cells with lentiviral particles of α2B−adrenergic
  receptor shRNA for 24 h and then culturing them with selection medium. (A) Expression
  of α2B−adrenergic receptors in wild−type cells and MOVAS−1 cells with α2B−adrenergic
  receptor knockdown. (B) Cell proliferation index was measured using the MTT assay,
  and protein expression levels of phospho−PLCγ1 (C) and phospho− (Ser) PKC substrates
  (D) were recognized by anti-phospho−PLCγ1 or anti−phospho− (Ser) PKC substrate antibodies,
  respectively, and then determined through Western blotting. ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001 compared with the non−PDGF-treated group; ##p < 0.01 compared with the positive
  control group. Data are presented as ± S.E.M. (n = 3).'
