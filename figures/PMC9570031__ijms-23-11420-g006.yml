caption: Functional category enrichment of DEGs/DEPs. DEGs/DEPs were classified into
  a total of 6 groups according to RNA-Seq and iTRAQ integrative analysis. The degree
  of the pathway enrichment was indicated according to the value of −log(q-value),
  as shown in the color bar. Each group was indicated by expression level (“go” for
  gene only, “po” for protein only, and “gp” for both gene and protein level, respectively)
  and regulatory direction (“up” for up-regulated and “dn” for down-regulated, respectively).
  The color brightness represents the degree of significant enrichment of pathways,
  as shown in the color bar.
