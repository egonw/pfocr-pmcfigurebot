caption: MA mitigates LPS-induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with
  100 mg/L MA for 12 h or 10 μM NAC (Positive control) for 30 min, followed by 1 mg/L
  LPS for 24 h. (a) The level of intracellular ROS was measured by DCF fluorescence
  using an enzyme marker. (b) MDA concentration was analyzed with 2-thiobarbituric
  and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT were determined
  using ELISA kits. Data are shown as mean ± SEM obtained from three independent experiments.
  *** p < 0.001.
