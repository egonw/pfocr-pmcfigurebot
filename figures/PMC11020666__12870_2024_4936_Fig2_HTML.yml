caption: Transcriptomic profiles of genes putatively involved in the FAs biosynthetic
  pathway. (A) Sketch of FAs biosynthetic pathway. Acetyl-CoA undergoes a series of
  reactions to produce C18:0-ACP, followed by desaturation to produce C18:1, C18:2,
  and C18:3. C18:1 can be further extended to produce VLCFA. Copyright permission
  of KEGG pathway maps (map00061) was obtained from Kanehisa laboratory by using the
  copyright permission request form in www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html. (B & C) Expression
  of (B) FADs and (C) KCSs involved in the FAs biosynthesis. The scales refer to log2FPKM.
  (D & E) The phylogenetic trees of (D) AtruFADs and AtFADs, and (E) AtruKCSs and
  AtKCSs. The phylogenetic trees of AtruFADs and AtFADs, and AtruKCSs and AtKCSs were
  constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method based on WAG + G and LG + G + I
  model respectively, within MEGA software (version X) and Evolview (http://www.evolgenius.info/evolview.html).

  of Acer truncatum seeds reveals key candidate genes related to unsaturated fatty
  acid biosynthesis, and potentially optimal production area.
