caption: '(a) Venn plot of three piRNA target gene prediction databases (TargetScan,
  miRDB-MicroRNA, and MrmicroT). A total of 66 target genes were found according to
  the overlap of the three databases (including 22 in uniq_271431, 43 in uniq_277797,
  and one in piR-hsa-1256314). (b) Network of piRNA and predicted target gene. Blue
  nodes stand for target genes. The shapes of the nodes represent different piRNAs.
  The lines represent the regulatory relationship between the piRNAs and target genes.
  (c) PPI interaction network of target genes determined by STRING. Lines indicate
  protein-protein interactions. (d) Functional enrichment analysis of target genes.
  GO enrichment analysis results for target genes. The functional enrichment analysis
  was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
  (DAVID). GO terms that are enrichment for target genes are shown in biological processes,
  molecular function, and cellular component. y-axis shows -log10 (p value), and x-axis
  shows the terms of GO pathway. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathways enrichment: the sizes of the circle dots indicate the numbers of enriched
  genes, and the color of circle indicates the -log10 (p value). The x-axis represents
  the number of genes in enrichments. (e) Network centralities calculated by MCC algorithm
  in CytoHubba plug-in. It can be seen that two of the top three central genes pointed
  to PIWIL1.'
