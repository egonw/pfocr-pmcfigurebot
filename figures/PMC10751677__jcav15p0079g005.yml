caption: Silibinin induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via inhibiting HSF1/
  Hsp70 pathway. Bladder cancer cells T24 and RT4 were treated with different concentrations
  of silibinin (0, 50, 100, 200 µM) for 24 or 48 hours, the expression of HSF1 was
  detected by western blotting. (B) The expression of HSF1 in cytosol and nuclear
  was analyzed using western blotting. (C) HSF1 reporter gene activity in silibinin
  treated bladder cancer cells was detected by dual-luciferase assay. (D, E) The bladder
  cancer cells were transfected with HSF1 plasmid, then the apoptosis rate was detected
  using flow cytometry (D) and the expressions of HSF1 and Hsp70 were detected by
  western blotting (E). *P<0.05 vs control group or the indicated group. Results are
  shown as the mean ± standard deviation of three experimental repeats.
