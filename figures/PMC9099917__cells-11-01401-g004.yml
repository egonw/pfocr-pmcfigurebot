caption: Effect of the BPF on the real-time ATP production rate in pAECs. (A) Evaluation
  of ATP production rate by mitochondrial OXPHOS (blue) (█) or by glycolysis (red)
  (█) in BPF-treated cells. (B) The ATP rate index, calculated as the ratio between
  the mitochondrial ATP production rate and the glycolytic ATP production rate, is
  shown on the y-axis (logarithmic scale) in pEACs treated without (control) and with
  the BPF. Data expressed as column charts ((A) plots) and points ((B) plots) represent
  the mean ± SD (vertical bars) from three experiments carried out on distinct cell
  preparations. Different lower-case letters indicate significantly different values
  (p ≤ 0.05) among BPF treatments (0, 50, 100, and 150 μg/mL) in the same metabolic
  pathway (OXPHOS or glycolysis) (A) and ratio value (B); different upper-case letters
  indicate different values (p ≤ 0.05) among treatments in ATP production rates due
  to sum of OXPHOS plus glycolysis (A).
