figure_title: PRIME-estimated metabolic fluxes and gene essentiality in mono- and
  P. bifermentans co-colonized conditions
caption: '(A) BioTapestry visualization of in vivo gene regulatory network for C.
  difficile 630: 79 essential genes with Inferelator-predicted transcriptional regulators
  are shown. The genes and regulators shown as five digit numbers represent the nomenclature
  preceded by ‘CD630_’. All regulators with less than two essential targets were combined
  in the ‘Others’ meta-regulator. The ‘#’ symbol indicates the 10 genes predicted
  as essential in the mono-colonized condition but not essential in vitro. (B) PRIME-estimated
  metabolic fluxes for each reaction in the mono- and co-colonized conditions. Z-score
  transformation was independently applied to each reaction and condition. The ‘*’
  symbol indicates that there is some contention about the existence of this pathway
  in C. difficile and it may need to be revised in future models.'
