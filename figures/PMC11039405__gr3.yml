caption: FleR modulates the transcription of PexsCEBA under Ca2+-rich conditions(A)
  A diagram showing the domain structure of the FleR protein.(B) β-galactosidase activity
  of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in the strains of PAO1
  WT, ΔfleR and ΔfleR with in trans overexpression of FleR or its variants with the
  absence of REC, AAA or HTH domain.(C) β-galactosidase activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ
  transcriptional fusion was measured in PAO1 WT and ΔfleR strains with the supplementation
  of EGTA in the growth medium.(D) β-galactosidase activity of the PexsCEBA-lacZ transcriptional
  fusion was measured in PAO1 WT and ΔfleR strains with the supplementation of NTA
  in the growth medium. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA or
  Student’s t test. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001 compared to the indicated
  group.
