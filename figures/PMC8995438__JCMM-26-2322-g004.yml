caption: Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK2 pathway reduces DNA damage repair and radiation
  resistance. (A) EdU staining was used to measure DNA synthesis in BxPC‐3 and PanC‐1
  cells treated with siRhoA or siNC and exposed to 4 Gy irradiation, bar = 100 μm.
  (B) TUNEL staining was used to evaluate apoptosis in BxPC‐3 and PanC‐1 cells treated
  with siRhoA or siNC and exposed to 4 Gy irradiation, bar = 100 μm. (C, D) Western
  blot analysis of ROCK2 and p‐γH2AX expression in BxPC‐3 and PanC‐1 cells treated
  with siRhoA or siNC and exposed to 4 Gy irradiation. (E, F) NFs were cultured with
  conditioned media obtained from si‐NC and siRhoA‐treated BxPC‐3 and PanC‐1 cells.
  Immunofluorescence staining of activated fibroblast markers, FAP and α‐SMA, bar
  = 50 μm (E). Western blot analysis of FAP and α‐SMA protein expression (F). Data
  are given as mean ± SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p <
  0.0001 using ANOVA
