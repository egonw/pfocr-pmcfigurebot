caption: The effects of crassolide on ER stress pathway activation in H460 cells.
  (A) H460 cells were treated with different doses of crassolide for 12 h, and Western
  blotting was performed to measure the expression levels of ER stress regulatory
  proteins. GAPDH expression was used as an internal control to show equal protein
  loading. (B) The protein expression levels quantified by ImageJ software are shown
  in the bar graphs. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3) for three independent
  experiments. Significant differences from the DMSO-treated control group are indicated
  by * p < 0.05 and *** p  <  0.001.
