caption: The antioxidant activity of ACCE and its active ingredients, L-anserine and
  L-carnosine. (A) The DPPH scavenging activity of ACCE, L-anserine, and L-carnosine
  was determined using ascorbic acid as a positive control and methanol diluent as
  a negative control. (B) ROS scavenging activity of ACCE on CCD-986Sk cells was examined
  using CM-H2DCFDA staining and flow cytometry. Shikonin (was used as the ROS inducer
  and ascorbic acid was used as a positive control (ROS scavenging agent). Star (*)
  represents p < 0.05 by Studentâ€™s t-test.
