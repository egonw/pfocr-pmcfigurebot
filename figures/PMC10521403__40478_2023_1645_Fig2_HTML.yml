caption: Molecular characteristics of NF2-altered WHO grade I meningiomas (Meningioma
  in NF2 patients versus sporadic NF2-altered meningiomas). A Pie chart of the frequency
  of chromosome 22 q loss in the meningiomas. B Pie chart of the frequency of chromosome
  1 p loss in the meningiomas. C The box plot shows the differences in the meningiomas’
  NF2 expression (FPKM). D Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of genes revealed
  two molecular groups that mostly matched meningiomas in patients with NF2 and sporadic
  NF2-altered meningiomas E GSEA showed that the differentially expressed genes between
  NF2 patients’ and sporadic NF2-altered tumours were significantly overrepresented
  in signatures associated with ‘ALLOGRAFT REJECTION’, ‘INTERFERON GAMMA RESPONSE’,
  ‘COMPLEMENT’, and ‘INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE’. F Pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed genes revealed that the immune response-associated genes were the most
  significantly enriched transcripts in NF2 patients’ relative to sporadic NF2-altered
  tumours
