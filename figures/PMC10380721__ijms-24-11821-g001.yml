caption: Knockout of KSR1 in BRAFV600E-mediated SK-MEL-239 cells does not impact bulk
  RAF-ERK signalling. (A) Schematic of KSR1 exon 1â€“5 structure and sequence of sgRNAs
  targeting exon 5. Untranslated exons are shown in light blue, and translated exons
  are in dark blue. Translation start (ATG) and stop (TAG) codons are indicated. Genomic
  target sites of the three crRNAs and corresponding PAM sites are shown in blue and
  red, respectively. (B) KSR1/2 and RAF-MEK-ERK pathway proteins were detected by
  Western blotting in wildtype (WT) cells and three KSR1 knockout clones (KO1-3).
  MEK and ERK activation was assessed using phosphospecific antibodies (pMEK and pERK).
