caption: Withaferin A suppressed H2O2-induced cell apoptosis via the Akt−dependent
  Prdx−1 and HO−1 antioxidant signaling pathway. HREMCs were pretreated with U0126
  or MK2206 for 15 min before treatment with withaferin A (50 nmol/mL) for 15 min,
  followed by incubation with H2O2 (50 μmol/L) for 8 h. (A,B) ROS generation was determined
  using DHE staining. (C) MTT cell survival assay to evaluate cell viability. (D)
  Western blotting to quantify cleaved caspase−3, caspase−3, HO−1, and Prdx−1 protein
  expression. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001. N = 6 for each treatment.
