caption: 'Effects of GXNT on the module function and pathway of gut microbiota in
  the CA model. Effects of GXNT on the relative abundance of (a) Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway-related microbiota, (b) pentose phosphate cycle-related microbiota, (c)
  hydroxypropionate pathway-related microbiota, (d) lipopolysaccharide production-related
  microbiota, (e) phosphoacetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway-related microbiota,
  (f) choline production-related microbiota, (g) MAPK pathway-related microbiota,
  and (h) AMPK pathway-related microbiota. M00008: Entner-Doudoroff pathway, glucose-6P=>glyceraldehyde-3P+pyruvate.
  M00167: reductive pentose phosphate cycle, glyceraldehyde-3P=>ribulose-5P. M00376:
  3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle. M00060: lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, KDO2-lipid
  A. M00579: phosphate acetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway, acetyl-CoA=>acetate.
  M00555: betaine biosynthesis, choline=>betaine. Map04016: MAPK signaling pathway-plant.
  Map04152: AMPK signaling pathway. n = 6 in both the control and GXNT groups, n =
  5 in the model group. #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01 vs. the control group; ∗P < 0.05 or
  ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. the model group.'
