caption: FOXO3a inhibits transcription of DEPDC1. (A) Binding site of transcription
  factor FOXO3a and DEPDC1 promoter. (B) Protein and (C) mRNA expression levels of
  FOXO3a were detected by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively. (D) Western
  blotting and (E) RT-qPCR were used to detect expression of FOXO3a in Ov-FOXO3a cells.
  (F) Luciferase detection of DEPDC1 promoter activity. (G) Immunoprecipitation indicated
  that FOXO3a bound to DEPDC1. (H) Western blotting and (I) RT-qPCR were used to detect
  expression of DEPDC1 in Ov-FOXO3a cells. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. HK-2 or Ov-NC.
  DEPDC, DEP domain containing 1; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression; RT-q,
  reverse transcription-quantitative; WT, wild-type; MUT, mutant.
