caption: BMSC‐Exos improves PA‐induced lipid droplet accumulation and obesity in mature
  3 T3‐L1 adipocytes. (A–E) 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes were added to MDI to differentiate
  them into mature adipocytes. Based on this, no or added BMSC‐Exos (10 and 20 μg·mL−1)
  were pretreated for 24 h, followed by adding PA to induce adipocytes in the obesity
  model. (A) CCK‐8 cytotoxicity assay. Different concentrations of BMSC‐Exos did not
  cause toxic effects on cells (n = 6 per group). (B, C) Analysis of lipid droplet
  accumulation in each group by cellular oil red O staining (n = 4 per group; bars = 100 μm).
  (D, E) Protein levels of obesity‐related genes (Leptin and FABP4) in various groups
  of cells (n = 3 per group). The error bars indicate the SEM, whereas comparisons
  between two groups were performed by an unpaired Student's test, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001. Ctrl, control group; MDI, adipocyte‐induced differentiation group;
  MDI + PA, adipocyte‐induced differentiation group with the addition of palmitic
  acid; MDI + PA + 10 μg·mL−1 exosome, adipocyte‐induced differentiation group treated
  with palmitic acid and 10 μg·mL−1 of exosome; MDI + PA + 20 μg·mL−1 exosome, adipocyte‐induced
  differentiation group treated with palmitic acid and 20 μg·mL−1 of exosome.
