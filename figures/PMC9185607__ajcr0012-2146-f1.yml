caption: No strong association was observed between tumor proliferation and Apical
  Junction Pathway score. (A) With TCGA cohort, there was no difference in MKI67 expression
  and Grade between high and low Apical Junction Pathway score groups. With the GSE84437
  cohort, while MKI67 expression and proliferation were higher in the low Apical Junction
  Pathway score group (P<0.001, respectively). (B) None of proliferation related gene
  sets, including G2M CHECKPOINT, MYC TARGETS V1/V2 and E2F TARGET were enriched in
  the high Apical Junction Pathway score group on GSEA (B). TCGA, the cancer genomic
  atlas; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis.
