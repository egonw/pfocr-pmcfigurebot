caption: Major signaling pathways regulating neutrophil degranulation. Ligation of
  GPCRs, Fc receptors, or the phagocytic β2‐integrin Mac‐1/CR3 triggers degranulation
  through multiple, partially overlapping downstream signaling pathways, converging
  on activation of Rac2, and increasing intracellular calcium. Rac2 is activated through
  GPCR‐activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors or the SFK (Src family of tyrosine
  kinases)‐Syk‐DOCK2 pathway following ligation of Fcγ receptors. Calcium signaling
  is driven by influx of extracellular calcium via DAG/PKC‐regulated SOCs or calcium
  release from intracellular stores via the IP3 receptor. Chemokine binding to GPCRs
  leads to direct binding of β‐arrestins to the receptor, which along with the Src‐family
  kinases Hck or Fgr translocate to the azurophilic and SG, respectively. Activation
  of TLR9 in the endosome also triggers degranulation through NF‐κB/iNOS‐mediated
  activation of Hck. DOCK‐2‐Rac2 signaling induces actin remodeling and granule transport
  from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Fusion of granules with the plasma membrane
  is governed by calcium‐dependent formation of SNARE complexes, consisting of granule
  VAMPs and cognate SNAPs/syntaxins on the plasma membrane. The Rab GTPase, Rab5,
  expressed on a subset of azurophilic granules, mediates their fusion with endosomes.
  AG, azurophilic (primary) granules; IP3R, IP3 receptor; SG, secretory (secondary)
  granules.
