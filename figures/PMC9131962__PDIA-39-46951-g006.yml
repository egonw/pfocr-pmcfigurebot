caption: 'TPS inhibited the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins via suppressing
  the α-MSH-MC1R signalling pathway. HEM cells were treated with TPS (10 μg/ml) and/or
  N-A (20 μm) in the presence or absence of UVA exposure (15 J/cm2). A – Western blot
  was then applied to detect the related protein levels. Equal protein loading was
  confirmed using GAPDH antibody. B–F – Mean intensity of MC1R, tyrosinase, TRP2,
  TRP1 and MITF are shown in the graph on the right. Error bars show means ± SEMs.
  *P < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus non-treated cells, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001 versus UVA-treated cells, ap < 0.05, aap < 0.01, aaap < 0.001, nsp
