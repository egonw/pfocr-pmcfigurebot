caption: 'Normoxia-related cell types. A: heatmap: top 15 most overexpressed transcripts
  in each subgroup in normoxia. Rows = transcript expression in the corresponding
  subgroups (columns). B: dot plot: average transcript expression in each subgroup.
  Perforated blue lines = subgroups expressing genes like Schyns’ clusters 1 (C_1)
  and 2 (C_2) (). Perforated green lines = subgroups expressing Cd206 and Lyve1. C:
  grouped UMAP plot with groups in normoxia (SL). D: G5 pathway analyses heatmaps.
  Di: functions Dii: canonical pathways. Diii: upstream regulators. Gray = N/A. E:
  bar graphs depicting the relative expression of Nlrp3, Osm, and S100a4. The error
  bars indicate the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). Ei: single-cell RNA
  sequence expression data from normoxia [sea level (SL) ∼21% ] (n = 1 mouse; n =
  374 IMs), day 1 (D1, n = 2 mice; n = 2,526 IMs), and day 7 (D7, n = 2 mice; n =
  1,211 IMs) post hypoxia exposure [5,486 m (hypoxia = ∼10% )]. Eii: RT-PCR (in biological
  triplicates) gene validation from SL, n = 3 (1 male and 2 females); day 1, n = 3
  (1 female and 2 males); and day 7, n = 2 (1 male and 1 female). N/A, not applicable;
  SL, sea level; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.'
