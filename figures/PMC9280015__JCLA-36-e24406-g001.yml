caption: LINC00941 inhibited the apoptosis of laryngocarcinoma cells while promoting
  the cell‐cycle progression in laryngocarcinoma cells. (A,B) The apoptosis of SNU‐46
  cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector was
  analyzed by flow cytometry. (C,D) The apoptosis of SNU‐899 cells transfected with
  shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression vector by was analyzed by flow cytometry.
  (E,F) Cell‐cycle progression of SNU‐46 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector
  or LINC00941 overexpression vector was assessed by flow cytometry. (G,H) Cell‐cycle
  progression of SNU‐899 cells transfected with shLINC00941 vector or LINC00941 overexpression
  vector was assessed by flow cytometry. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; * vs. Empty vector.

article_title: LINC00941 promoted in vitro progression and glycolysis of laryngocarcinoma
  by upregulating PKM via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
