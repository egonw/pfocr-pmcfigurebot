caption: BMP ligands, receptors, and interacting receptors. BMP signal transduction
  involves a number of ligands, type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors,
  and coreceptors, which regulate the activation of intracellular mediators in interactions
  with extracellular stimuli. BMPs are classified into several subfamilies according
  to sequence homology. The BMP signaling pathways. Canonical Smad signaling executes
  its function through Smad proteins. BMPs interact with the type I and type II receptors
  to form a heterotetrameric complex. Complex formation and ligand binding can be
  potentiated by a coreceptor, that is, endoglin, betaglycan, or repulsive guidance
  molecule (RGM). Upon phosphorylation by the type II receptor, the type I receptor
  recruits and phosphorylates pathway-specific R Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5 and Smad-8,
  and Smad-2 and Smad-3), which can form trimers with Smad-4 and translocate to the
  nucleus. Smads have intrinsic DNA-binding activity and can regulate gene expression
  by recruitment of chromatin-remodeling machinery and integration with tissue-specific
  transcription factors. Non-canonical Smad signaling, through phosphorylated TAK
  (pTAK). Ligand binding induces the formation of the receptor complex. BmpR-I is
  linked to the TAK1/TAB1 complex through the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)
  to phosphorylate and activate the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),
  including p38, ERK1/2, and JNK. Consequently, activation of these kinases leads
  to their translocation into the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate and
  regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Canonical Smad signaling
  is intracellularly inhibited by inhibitory Smads, that is, Smad-6 and/or Smad-7,
  and E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Smurf1 or Smurf2, whose expression provides the
  cell with a negative feedback mechanism. The pathway can be antagonized by many
  mechanisms, including neutralization of ligands by secreted traps, such as noggin,
  follistatin, gremlin, chordin, chordin-like; secretion of latent ligands bound to
  their propeptides; or via titration of receptors by nonsignaling ligands, such as
  BMP-3. ACVR, activin receptor; ACVR2, activin type-2 receptor; ALK, activin receptor-like
