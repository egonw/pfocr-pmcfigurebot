caption: Mitochondria play a central role in metabolic pathways contributing to HSC
  maintenance. Overview of metabolic pathways contributing to HSC self-renewal and
  differentiation. HSCs mainly rely on glycolysis, which starts with the conversion
  of glucose into glucose-6P, and results in the generation of pyruvate, transformed
  from PEP by PKM2. Upon differentiation, pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria,
  fueling OXPHOS, and generating NADH and FADH2 to sustain high energy demands. OXPHOS
  produce ROS, and increased ROS negatively affects stem cell properties. To avoid
  the activation of OXPHOS and ROS production, HSCs utilize several alternative metabolism
  pathways. HIF-1 promotes glycolysis pathway and the conversion of pyruvate into
  lactate, enhancing the activity of LDH. Glucose-6P can be used by PPP to generate
  Ribose-5P to sustain nucleotides synthesis. HIF-1 also activates the PDK2/4, which
  is highly expressed in HSCs, and downregulates aerobic metabolism through inhibition
  of PDH-mediated conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. TCA cycle intermediates, Acetyl-CoA,
  and αKG link to lipids and amino acid metabolisms, respectively. Templates created
  with BioRender.com. -5P = -5 phosphate; -6P = 6-phosphate; HIF-1 = Hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1; HSC = hematopoietic stem cell; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; OXPHOS = oxidative
  phosphorylation; PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK = pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase;
  PEP = phosphoenolpyruvic acid; PKM2 = pyruvate kinase M2; PPP = pentose phosphate
  pathway; ROS = reactive oxygen species; TCA = tricarboxylic acid; αKG = α-ketoglutarate.
