caption: ALDH1B1 promotes alterations in the gene expression profile of a panel of
  DNA damage signaling genes in HT29 cells. Total RNA was extracted from the HT29
  isogenic cell line pair, and the RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array for Human DNA Damage Signaling
  Pathway (PAHS-029ZA) was utilized to determine the expression profile of 84 different
  DNA damage signaling (DDS)-related genes. (a) The clustergram displays a heat map
  indicating the magnitude of gene expression along with a dendrogram, which organizes
  genes in proportion to their expression pattern. The color saturation indicates
  the magnitude of gene expression. Red squares indicate higher expression, black
  squares indicate no change, and green squares indicate lower expression. The x-axis
  shows the HT29/ALDH1B1 and HT29/mock samples of the three independent experiments,
  whereas the y-axis represents the PCR array genes. (b) Genes of cluster I (MRE11A,
  PMS1, RAD18 and UNG) exhibited upregulation, whereas genes of cluster II (CIB1,
  ERCC2, MLH3, PMS2, PPM1D, RAD51B and SIRT1). (c) Genes MRE11A, PMS1, RAD18 and UNG
  were found to be up-regulated in HT29/ALDH1B1 cells (fold change of expression (≥1.5)),
  whereas CIB1, ERCC2, MLH3, PMS2, PPM1D, RAD51B and SIRT1 exhibited negative regulation
  in the ALDH1B1-overexpressing HT29 cells. Five different housekeeping genes were
  used for normalization (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPLP10) of gene expression.
  Results are shown as mean ± S.D. Three independent experiments were performed for
  each sample. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
