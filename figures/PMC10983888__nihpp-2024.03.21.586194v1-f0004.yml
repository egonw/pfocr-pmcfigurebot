figure_title: Body weight and adiposity phenotype of PTER-KO mice
caption: (a-d) Body weight (a), change in body weight (b), cumulative food intake
  (c), and water intake (d) of 13 to 14-week-old male WT or PTER-KO mice on high fat
  diet and after taurine water supplementation (2.5% w/v). N=10/group.(e-j) Glucose
  tolerance test (e), insulin tolerance test (f), tissue weights (g), representative
  adipose tissues (h), plasma taurine levels (i), and plasma N-acetyltaurine levels
  (j) of 13 to 14-week-old male WT or PTER-KO mice after 8 weeks on high fat diet
  and taurine water supplementation (2.5% w/v). N=10/group. iWAT, inguinal white adipose
  tissue; eWAT, epididymal white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; Quad,
  quadriceps muscle.(k) Metabolic chamber analysis of 8 to 9-week-old-male WT or PTER-KO
  mice after 4 weeks of high fat diet/taurine water supplementation (2.5% w/v). N=9/group.
  RER, respiratory exchange ratio.Data are shown as mean ± SEM. In (a-f), P-values
  were calculated from two-way ANOVA with post hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
  In (g-k), P-values were calculated from two-tailed unpaired t-tests.
