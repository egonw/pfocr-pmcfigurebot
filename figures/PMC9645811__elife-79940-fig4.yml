figure_title: Suppression of protein translation upon FLT3 inhibition is significantly
  alleviated by human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC-CM) via an mTOR-dependent mechanism
caption: '(A) Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of Gene Ontology gene sets from
  in vitro study () showing enrichment of translational control in acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) cells treated with quizartinib in hBMSC-CM, compared with quizartinib-treated
  cells in RPMI. (B) MOLM-13 cells were treated with vehicle, 3 nM quizartinib, 10
  nM everolimus, or quizartinib + everolimus (combo) in RPMI or hBMSC-CM for 15 hr
  and harvested for Western blotting to measure mTOR signaling and its downstream
  mediators involved in translational control. (C) MOLM-13 cells were treated with
  the indicated drugs at different time points (3, 6, 12, and 15 hr), followed by
  labeling with O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), to measure translation activity using
  flow cytometry (MFI: mean fluorescence intensity for OPP incorporation). Cells were
  treated with 10 ug/mL cycloheximide (CHX) as a control for inhibition of translation
  (n = 3). (D) Representative flow cytometry histograms of OPP assay from cells treated
  with vehicle, quizartinib, and combo in RPMI or hBMSC-CM for 15 hr, showing binary
  peaks (OPP-High and OPP-Low). Percent of OPP-Low population from all treatment groups
  is shown at the bottom. (E) MOLM-13 cells were treated with the indicated drugs
  for 12 hr and harvested for polysome profiling. Area under the curve for each treatment
  was normalized to the vehicle-treated group in RPMI and is shown for 80S peak fraction
  (position 33–44) and heavy polysome fraction (position 62–73) at the bottom (n =
  3 for everolimus-treated cells in hBMSC-CM, n = 4 for all other groups). (F) MOLM-13
  cells were treated with 3 nM quizartinib and homoharringtonine (HHT) alone or together
  as indicated (increasing concentrations of HHT of 1, 5, and 10 nM indicated by triangles)
  for 48 hr in RPMI or hBMSC-CM, followed by measurement of apoptosis (n = 3). Figure
  4—source data 1.Unedited raw blots for  are shown.  Figure 4—source data 2.Unedited
  blots with labels for  are shown.'
