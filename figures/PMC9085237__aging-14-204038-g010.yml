caption: Crystal violet-stained colonies in soft agar in the presence of 5-Fluorouracil.
  The effects of pLXSN and WT-TP53 on the colony formation in soft agar were photographed
  after staining. Photographs were taken at the same day and at the same magnification
  on the microscope. (A) MIA-PaCa-2 + pLXSN cells treated with increasing concentration
  of 5FU, (B) MIA-PaCa-2 + WT-TP53 cells treated with increasing concentrations of
  5FU.
