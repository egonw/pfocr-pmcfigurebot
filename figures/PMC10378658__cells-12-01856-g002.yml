caption: “Bulk” RNA sequencing of 2D and 3D cultured GBM models. (A) Principal component
  analysis of 11 GBM models. “Distinct” 3D (Group 1, Group 2) and corresponding 2D
  (Group 3, Group 4) samples are highlighted. Percent of differentially regulated
  genes of the groups are indicated. “Non-Distinct” (N.D.) 2D and 3D models are indicated.
  (B) Volcano plot of differentially regulated genes (2D versus 3D) with a log fold
  change >5 and p-value < 0.05. (C) Heat map of the top 50 most variable genes. Corresponding
  cultures are labeled 3D (solid box) and 2D (dotted line). (D) GSEA with enrichment
  plots for “Interferon α/β” (R-HSA-909733) signaling and “Antigen presentation, folding
  assembly and peptide loading of class I MHC” (R-HSA-983170) pathways using the Reactome
  Pathway Database (FDR score < 25%). (E) Normalized expression values for selected
  MHC class surface receptor genes (HLA-A, HLA-E), B2M, and stress-signaling markers
  (MICA and 14-3-3ε/14-3-3ζ). Asterisks indicate significant differences with p-value
  < 0.05.
