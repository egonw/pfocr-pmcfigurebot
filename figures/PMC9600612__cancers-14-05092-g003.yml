caption: 'Transcriptomic analyses of H358 tumors using nCounter PanCancer Human IO
  360 assay. (A) Volcano plot showing differential expression of genes in tumors treated
  with scL-RB94 versus the baseline of untreated tumors. The volcano plot is presented
  as fold change in gene expression [log2(fold change)] against statistical significance
  of change [−log10(p-value)]. (B) ToppGene Suite analysis of differentially expressed
  genes. Groups reflect main categories of gene ontology (GO) terms: molecular function,
  biological process, cellular component, and canonical pathway. Vertical and horizontal
  axes represent each category term and −log10(FDR adjusted p-value) of the corresponding
  term, respectively.'
