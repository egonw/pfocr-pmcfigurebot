caption: Toxicity Data. No toxicity was found with ICM delivery of ABT-414 in the
  brain. Systemic exposure was observed in the liver of one rat. Representative images
  of brain (left), eye (middle), and liver (right) from one control animal administered
  1 mg/kg AB095 (upper panel) and one treatment animal administered 1 mg/kg ABT-414
  (lower panel). (a) There was no toxicity in the brain (inset showing healthy neurons
  from the cerebral cortex) and eye (cornea). (b) In the liver of one animal administered
  1 mg/kg ABT-414, there were increased number of mitotic figures and single cell
  necrosis within hepatocytes (arrows) and mitotically arrested sinusoidal cells (arrow
  heads) in the animal administered ABT-414 (H&E). Sinusoidal cells showed strong
  reactivity to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) immunostaining
  (arrow heads, lower right corner). In contrast, VEGFR2 staining of control rat liver
  tissue showed diffuse and continuous positive signal in sinusoidal endothelial cells
  (SECs) lining the hepatic cords (upper right corner) (IHC). (c) There were no microscopic
  liver changes associated with ICM delivery of a lower dose of ABT-414 at 0.3 mg/kg.
  The other two rats administered ABT-414 at 1 mg/kg did not show any microscopic
  findings in the liver (H&E). n = 3 animals per treatment group.
