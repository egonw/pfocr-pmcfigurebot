figure_title: Overview of the study screening strategy
caption: A Major cancer drivers captured by the cell line collection screened. The
  y-axis in this figure shows the fraction of cell lines with a driver mutation. Figure
  also shows the percentage of KRAS mutated cell lines which also have a P53 and STK11
  mutation. B Screen set-up and key characteristics. C Anchor drugs used. D Library
  drugs used grouped by target class. Abbreviations used â€“ DDR DNA Damage Response,
