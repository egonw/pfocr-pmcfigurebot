caption: 'Effect of DFMO and rapamycin on viability of breast cancer cells. Cells
  were treated with DFMO and rapamycin, singularly and in combination at the indicated
  concentrations for 48 h, cytotoxicity was measured using MTT assay. (a) MDA-MB-231
  cells in the presence of DFMO and rapamycin. (b) MCF-7 cells in the presence of
  DFMO and rapamycin (because MCF-7 cell was more sensitive to rapamycin treatment,
  lower concentrations was used). The results were expressed as the percentage of
  viable cells compared to the untreated control. Values shown are mean ± S.E.M, of
  at least 18 wells from three independent experiments for MCF-7 and mean ± range,
  of at least 12 wells from two independent experiments for MDA-MB-231. Note: Rapa
  represents rapamycin. Statistics was performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  post hoc analysis, where *** p < 0.001 vs. DFMO alone. The values above the bars
  for the combination treatment are the EOB scores.'
