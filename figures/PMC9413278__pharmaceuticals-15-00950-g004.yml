caption: 'Transcriptome alterations of HepG2 cells were uncovered by high-throughput
  sequencing. (A) Volcano map showed significant differentiation of gene expression
  in HepG2 cells treated with or without curcumin (n = 3). The larger the â€“log10 (pValue),
  the more significant difference. The red, green, and black spots in the scatter
  plot showed up-regulated, down-regulated, and no difference genes, respectively.
  (B) The top 30 DEGs were provided in  via KEGG enrichment analysis. PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway (ID ko04151) is significant (109/1805) in cancer. The Qvalue was represented
  by the color of the spots, and the smaller the Qvalue, the closer to red. The number
  of DEGs in each function was represented by the size of the spots. (C) Histogram
  of GO annotation classification of differential genes. GO enrichment consists of
  three ontologies: molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological
  process (BP). The light colors represented the differentially expressed genes and
  the dark colors represented all genes. (D) The top 30 DEGs were provided via BP
  enrichment analysis. (E) The AKT signal pathway. The brightness of the color reflected
  the average expression level of the certain gene via KEGG enrichment analysis. The
  red indicated relatively higher gene expression while the green represented lower
  gene expression.'
