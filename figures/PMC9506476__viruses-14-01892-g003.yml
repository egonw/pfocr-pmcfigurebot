caption: (A) Cell cycle and DNA replication/repair (B) and ubiquitin proteolysis genes
  were investigated for potential differential regulation in presence of SlaGemV−1
  infection in S. sclerotiorum. Distance matrices of the differential expression analysis
  were visualized as heatmaps. Genes relating to cell cycle controls and DNA replication
  and repair are seen largely up regulated in presence of SlaGemV−1. Likewise, genes
  relating to the up regulation of ubiquitin proteolysis pathway are also up regulated
  during viral infection.
