caption: Pathways and biofunctions in the acute response to sepsis (within 12 hours
  of sepsis onset), compared with control patients. A, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  of differentially expressed probes showed downregulation of pathways mainly related
  to amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cellular energy production in sepsis
  compared with SIRS. The only pathway that was significantly upregulated in sepsis
  is associated with IL-1â€“mediated inhibition of retinoid X receptors. P values are
  calculated by IPA using right-tailed Fisher exact test to measure likelihood that
  pathways or functions are overrepresented by molecules in data set. B, Ingenuity
  toxicology analysis of differentially expressed probes shows that hepatic steatosis
  is the top toxicological response of the dysregulated transcriptome followed by
  repeated occurrence of cell death in liver and in kidney. The only downregulated
  toxicology pathway in sepsis is conjugation of glutathione.
