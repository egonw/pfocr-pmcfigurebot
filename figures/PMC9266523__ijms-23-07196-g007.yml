caption: 'Effect of dietary supplementation with Cys on the liver response to treatment
  with APAP for 18 d. Ctrl and APAP diets were supplemented with alanine (Ala) or
  cysteine (Cys). Ala was added to make diets iso-nitrogenous to Cys diets. The APAP-Cys
  group was fed ad libitum. The three other groups were pair-fed with the APAP-Cys
  group. (A) Liver mass. (B) Total GSH concentration in the liver. (C) Immunoblot
  analysis of phosphorylation (P-) of GCN2, eIF2α, and NRF2, GCN2, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4,
  NRF2, and GAPDH. (D) Expression of a set of ATF4-dependent genes. Total RNA extracted
  from the liver was analyzed by reverse transcription RT-qPCR. Each bar shows the
  median with interquartile and dots are individual values. ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001
  **** p ≤ 0.0001 vs. PF-Ala; ## p ≤ 0.01; ### p ≤ 0.001; #### p ≤ 0.0001 vs. respective
  Ala group; Mann Whitney test.'
