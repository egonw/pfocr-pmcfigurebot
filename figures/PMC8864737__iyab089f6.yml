caption: Pathway enrichment analysis using WormPaths levels. Pathway enrichment analysis
  using a previously published RNA-seq dataset of C. elegans untreated, treated with
  20nM vitamin B12, or treated with 20nM vitamin B12 and 40mM propionate with a p-adjusted
  of ≤0.05 and a fold change of ±1.5 shows enrichment of lipids and one-carbon cycle
  pathways (left, blue). The arrows indicate the directionality of differentially
  expressed genes. No arrow indicates both increased and decreased gene expression.
  WormPaths enrichment for curated metabolic genes complements and adds resolution
  to the genome scale enrichment metabolic results from WormCat (right, orange).
