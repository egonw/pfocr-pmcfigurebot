caption: 'miR‐190a could reversely regulated AHNAK through 3′UTR region binding. (A)
  QRT‐PCR was used to detect relative expression of miR‐190a in HCC tissues and matched
  para‐cancer tissues (n = 40; n = 40). (B) Pearson correlation analysis between miR‐190a/AHNAK
  and miR‐190a/circ_0008194. (C) The detailed sequence for miR‐190a bound to AHNAK.
  (D) Dual‐luciferase reporter assay. (E) Relative expression of AHNAK in miRNA mimics
  and circRNA shRNA‐treated cells and relative expression of AHNAK in cells treated
  with circRNA overexpression and shRNA lentivirus. (F): Relative protein expression
  level of AHNAK and metastasis markers in cells treated with circRNA overexpression
  and shRNA lentivirus (n.s indicated no significance, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01)'
article_title: CircRNA_0008194 functions as a ceRNA to promote invasion of hepatocellular
  carcinoma via inhibiting miR‐190a/AHNAK signaling pathway.
