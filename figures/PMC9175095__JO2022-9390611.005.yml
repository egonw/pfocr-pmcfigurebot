caption: 'IGF2-AS/miR-579-3p/MSH6 axis activates the autophagy signaling pathway to
  enhance CDDP resistance of OS cells. (a) RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis for determination
  of the silencing effect of lentiviral sh-MSH6. (b) Expressions of IGF2-AS, miR-579-3p,
  and MSH6 in OS cells determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. (c) The autophagy
  in the OS cells observed under TEM. (d) Measurement of expressions of autophagy-related
  genes p62, Beclin1, and LC3 in OS cells by Western blot analysis. (e) The CCK-8
  assay to detect the IC50 value of CDDP in OS cells. (f) Flow cytometry analysis
  to examine the apoptosis of OS cells. âˆ—p < 0.05vs. sh-NC/oe-NC+sh-NC, #p < 0.05vs.
