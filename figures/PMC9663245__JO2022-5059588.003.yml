  apoptosis. (a) The viability of LCSCs detected by CCK-8 assay (b) The proliferation
  of LCSCs detected by colony formation assay. (c) The changes in colony number. (d)
  and (e) Abundance of proliferation-associated proteins. (f) and (g) The migration
  of LCSCs detected by Transwell assay. (h) and (i) Abundance of EMT-associated proteins.
  (j) and (k) The apoptosis of LCSCs analyzed by flow cytometry. (l) and (m) Abundance
  of apoptosis-associated proteins.
