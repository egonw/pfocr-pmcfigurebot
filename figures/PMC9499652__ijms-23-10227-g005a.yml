caption: Canonical pathway comparison of 4T1 primary tumor and metastatic subpopulations
  by IPA with GSE62598 data. Heat maps show (a) activation score (absolute z-score
  > 2) and (b) p value absolute log p-value > 1.3. (c) Sirtuin pathway was generated
  from GSE62598 data that include the gene expression profile of 4T1 primary tumors
  and liver/lung metastatic subpopulations in a mouse model. The figure represents
  gene profiling in liver metastasis of 4T1 cells (absolute log p-value > 1.3). (d)
  Cell proliferation of tumor cells was found to have a regulator effect in liver
  and lung metastases of 4T1 cells by IPA. The intensity of the node color indicated
  the degree of regulation (red; upregulation, green; downregulation).
