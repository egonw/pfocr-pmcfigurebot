caption: 'Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of hub genes. (a) Heat plot summarizes
  the association between the GSVA score and the activity of cancer-related pathways
  in PCa. (b) Heatmap summarizes the percentage of PCa in the mRNA expression of hub
  genes (TOP2A, NCAPG, and BUB1B) that potentially affect pathway activity. The GSVA
  score represents the integrated level of gene set expression which is positively
  correlated with the gene expression. ∗P value ≤ 0.05; #FDR ≤ 0.05.'
