caption: 'Solamargine regulated CXCL3 expression which played a role in the proliferation
  of cervical cancer cells. (a–c) The expression of CXCL3 in cervical cancer cells
  transfected with plasmid targeting CXCL3 was verified by qRT-PCR and western blot.
  GAPDH served as the internal control. (d) Following exposure to 10 μM solamargine,
  qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of CXCL3 in the transfected cells. GAPDH
  served as the internal control. (e) After CXCL3 overexpression, the proliferative
  capacity of solamargine-treated cells was determined by colony formation assay.
  ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. NC; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. control; ###p < 0.001 vs. solamargine + NC.
  qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; CXCL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3; NC, negative control.'
