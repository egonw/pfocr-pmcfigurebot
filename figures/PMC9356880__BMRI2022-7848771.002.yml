caption: GSVA for samples and KEGG enrichment analysis for DEGs (a). 29 upregulated
  (red spots) and 19 downregulated (green spots) metabolic pathways were identified
  via GSVA in LUAD samples versus normal lung samples. Adjusted p value < 0.05 and
  |logFC| > 0.3 were utilized as the cutoff criteria for determining significant differences
  (b). Heat map for the significantly altered metabolic pathways (c). 1,109 upregulated
  (red spots) and 310 downregulated (green spots) DEGs were identified in LUAD samples
  versus normal lung samples. Adjusted p value < 0.05 and |logFC| > 2 were utilized
  as the cutoff criteria for determining significant differences (d). KEGG enrichment
  analysis for DEGs (e). Cell cycle was the common pathway identified in both GSVA
  and KEGG analyses.
