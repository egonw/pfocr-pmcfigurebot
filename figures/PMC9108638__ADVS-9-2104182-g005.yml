caption: 'A) Schematic illustration of PTT‐induced ICD eliciting DC maturation. B)
  Flow cytometry analysis of BMDC maturation after 24 h culture with different tumor
  cell groups. BMDCs cultured without tumor cells served as a control. The histograms
  and corresponding peak figures represent CD80, CD86, CD40, MHCII, and CCR7 expression
  (gating on CD11c+ cells). C) BMDC morphology was imaged using an optical microscope
  (scale bar: 10 µm). Quantification of D) IL‐6, E) IL‐12p40, and F) TNF‐α secretion
  in BMDC suspensions, n = 3. G) Quantification of IFN‐γ secretion from T cell suspensions.
  H) The proliferation of CD3+ T cells harvested from spleen after coincubation with
  differently treated tumor cells measured using flow cytometry. T cells without any
  treatment served as a control (group 1). Data are expressed as the means ± SD, n
  = 3. Statistical significance is defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  and ns represents no significant difference.'
