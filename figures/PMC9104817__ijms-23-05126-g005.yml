caption: In vitro migration assay ofH2228, H3122 and A549 cell lines. Cells were treated
  with CD73 inhibitors, moAb anti-CD73 at 20 µg/mL and APCP at 50 µM, and chemoattracted
  by SDF-1 at 50 ng/mL. Data represent the mean number ± SD of migrated cells after
  treatment relative to the untreated control. Significance was calculated by one-
  way Anova comparing treated cells vs. positive control. Two experiments were performed
  for each cell line.
