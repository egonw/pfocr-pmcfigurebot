caption: 'The expression level of myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate
  in gastric cancer and its relationship with LINC01268. A: The relative mRNA expression
  level of myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) in 62 cases
  of gastric cancer (GC) tissues was significantly higher than that of paired adjacent
  noncancerous tissue (ANTs). Expression levels were normalized to the ACTB levels.
  The results were shown as the mean ± SD; B: The protein levels of MARCKS in 4 pairs
  of GC tissues were significantly higher than those in paired ANTs. Expression levels
  were normalized to GAPDH levels. The results were shown as the mean ± SD; C: The
  protein levels of MARCKS in LINC01268 high expression groups were not higher than
  those in the LINC01268 low expression groups; D: Western blot detected the MARCKS
  protein expression of 4 pairs of GC tissues (C) and ANTs (N); E: The mRNA expression
  levels of MARCKS and LINC01268 in 62 cases of GC were positively correlated (r =
  0.395, P = 0.002); F: LINC01268 and MARCKS showed a positive correlation in 375
  GC samples in the starBase online database (r = 0.310, P < 0.0001); G: In Kaplan-Meier
  plotter online database, the prognosis and survival of 392 GC patients with high
  expression of MARCKS were worse than 239 GC patients with relatively low expression
  of MARCKS (log-rank P = 0.0023). aP < 0.05, dP < 0.0001, eP > 0.05. MARCKS: Myristoylated
  alanine rich protein kinase C substrate; GC: Gastric cancer; ANT: Adjacent noncancerous
  tissue; HR: Hazard ratio.'

  metastasis of gastric cancer via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and targeting MARCKS.
