caption: KEGG pathway analysis of exosomal circRNAs and a network diagram of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA
  interactions based on the differential expression of seven predicted circRNAs. (A)
  The top 10 KEGG signaling pathway of exosomal circRNAs obtained from the seminal
  plasma of patients with OAZ. (B) Red represents upregulated circRNAs, green represents
  downregulated circRNAs, lines represent interactions; arrows represent miRNA; red
  hexagons represented upregulated mRNA, green hexagons represented downregulated
  mRNA. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; circRNA, circular RNA; miRNA,
  microRNA; OAZ, oligoasthenospermia.
article_title: Functional prediction and profiling of exosomal circRNAs derived from
  seminal plasma for the diagnosis and treatment of oligoasthenospermia.
