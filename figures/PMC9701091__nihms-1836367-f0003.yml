caption: A. The model, reproduced from [], shows how the cell surface heparan sulfate
  proteoglycan syndecan on ovarian granulosa cells is catabolized through an endosomal
  pathway. The modification (red) shows the ability of this pathway to recycle heparan
  sulfate fragments outside the cell as occurs in kidney mesangial cells [, ]. B.
  The model, reproduced from [], shows how cell surface hyaluronan is catabolized
  on many cells.
