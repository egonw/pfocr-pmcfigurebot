caption: Transcriptome-wide identification of the YTHDF1 targets in prostate cancer
  cells. (A) Heatmap illustrating the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PC-3
  cells between KO-NC and YTHDF1-KO groups. (B) Volcano map showing DEGs in PC-3 cells
  between the KO-NC and YTHDF1-KO groups. (C) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  plots showing the Gene Ontology of DEGs altered by knockout of YTHDF1 in prostate
  cancer cells. (D) GSEA plots showing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway of DEGs altered by knockout of YTHDF1 in prostate cancer cells. (E)
  Distribution of immunoprecipitation RNAs in different RNA subgroups. (F) GO and
  KEGG enrichment analyses of immunoprecipitated genes. (G) Cumulative distribution
  map of YTHDF1-targeted and non YTHDF1-targeted genes expression. (H) Top consensus
  motif detected using HOMER with m6A-seq peaks in PC-3 cells. (I) Distribution of
  m6A modified RNAs in different RNA subgroups. (Jâ€’K) Distribution of m6A modification
  locations in transcripts of PC-3 cells. (L) Schematic workflow of YTHDF1 downstream
  target analysis using m6A-seq, RIP-seq, TMT proteomic analysis, and RNA-seq. (M)
  KEGG annotated that PLK1 is involved in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle.
