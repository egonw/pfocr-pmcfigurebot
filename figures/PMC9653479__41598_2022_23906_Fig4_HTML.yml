caption: RSL3 induces double-stranded DNA breaks and inhibits DNA damage repair response
  in PTC in vitro. (A) Immunofluorescent staining for γ-H2AX nuclear foci expression
  in K1 cells treated with RSL3 or DMSO-control (γ-H2AX = red, DAPI = blue, × 20 magnification).
  (B) Quantification of γ-H2AX foci in 50 RSL3-treated K1 cells and 50 control-treated
  cells (RSL3, 97.3 foci/cell vs DMSO, 38.6 foci/cell; p < 0.0001). (C) Western blot
  analysis of γ-H2AX, pNPM1, NPM1, and LC3A/B in RSL3-treated or DMSO-treated K1 cells.
  (D) Dual immunofluorescent staining of K1 cells for pNPM1 (T199) and γ-H2AX co-localization
  using confocal microscopy (pNPM1 = green, γ-H2AX = red, DAPI = gray, × 63). (E)
  Immunofluorescent staining for γ-H2AX expression in RSL3-, Fer1- and DMSO-treated
  K1 cells (γ-H2AX = red, DAPI = blue, × 20 magnification). (F) Western blot analysis
  of γ-H2AX expression in RSL3-, Fer1- and DMSO-treated K1 cells.
