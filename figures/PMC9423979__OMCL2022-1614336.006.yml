caption: M2-CM promoted cancer aggressiveness through activating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2
  pathway. (a) The shRNA for Nrf2 was delivered into the GBM cells, and the transfection
  efficiency was determined by Real-Time qPCR. (b, c) Cell proliferation abilities
  were determined by performing MTT assay. (d, e) Real-Time qPCR was performed to
  determine the expression status of CDK2, CDK6, and Cyclin D1. (f, g) The EMT-associated
  markers were examined by conducting Real-Time qPCR. (h, i) The expression levels
  of the cancer stem cell biomarkers were determined by Real-Time qPCR analysis. Each
  experiment repeated at least 3 times, and âˆ—P < 0.05.
