caption: 'Model II: Nuclear NRF2 ultrasensitivity arising from multistep signaling.
  (A) Structure of Model II, containing basal synthesis of cytosolic NRF2 (NRF2c)
  (k0) and stressor S-induced synthesis due to translation enhancement (k1), KEAP1-independent
  NRF2c degradation (k3), KEAP1-dependent NRF2c degradation (k2), inhibition of KEAP1
  activity by S (Kd2), importation of NRF2c into the nucleus (k4), exportation of
  nuclear NRF2 (NRF2n) (k5) which is inhibited by S (Kd5), and NRF2n degradation (k6).
  (B) Simulated steady-state dose-response of NRF2c and NRF2n, with the latter exhibiting
  a higher degree of ultrasensitivity. (C) Loss of ultrasensitivity of NRF2n when
  only one of the three steps, (i) NRF2c stabilization, (ii) enhanced NRF2c translation,
  and (iii) inhibited NRF2n exportation, is present as indicted. (D) Reduced ultrasensitivity
  of NRF2n when two of the three steps are present as indicted.'
