caption: 'Response of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to BEZ-235 inhibition.
  (A) Heatmap represents fold change in protein phosphorylation of PI3K pathway members
  in ex vivo BEZ-235 stimulated cells compared to their unstimulated state in T-cell
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients samples (in columns) obtained at diagnosis.
  Only gated T-ALL cells were considered in the analysis. Squares represent the fold
  change in phosphorylation of proteins listed in rows. Hierarchical clustering with
  Euclidean distance metrics and an average linkage dissects two clusters of T-ALL:
  BEZ-235 responder and BEZ-235 non-responder. (B) Median intensity of p-4E-BP1, p-AKT
  and p-S6 in untreated and ex vivo BEZ-235 treated specimens from BEZ-235 responder
  T-ALL (circles, n=11) and BEZ-235 non-responder T-ALL (squares, n=5) samples are
  shown. Median intensity of p-4EBP1 and p-AKT decreased after ex vivo BEZ-235 treatment
  in BEZ-235 responder T-ALL but not in BEZ-235 non-responder. (C) Median intensity
  of phosphorylated LCK in BEZ-235 responder T-ALL (circles, n=11) and BEZ-235 non-responder
  T-ALL (squares, n=5) is shown.'
article_title: Either IL-7 activation of JAK-STAT or BEZ inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathways dominates the single-cell phosphosignature of ex vivo treated pediatric
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.
