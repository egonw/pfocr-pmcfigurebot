caption: Hsp90 governs C. albicans filamentation through complex signal transduction
  networks. The Ras1–cAMP–PKA signaling cascade is a core signal transduction pathway
  that regulates C. albicans filamentous growth. Hsp90 and its cochaperone Sgt1 exert
  repressive effects on the adenylate cyclase Cyr1. Upon compromise of Hsp90 function,
  Cyr1 is activated to produce cAMP, which activates PKA to signal through downstream
  transcription factors that remain to be identified. The Rho1–Pkc1 cell wall integrity
  pathway acts as a key modulator of cell wall integrity through activation of a mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that terminates with Mkc1. Hsp90 along with its cochaperone
  Cdc37 interacts with Pkc1, as well as the other components of the MAPK cascade.
  Pkc1 regulates C. albicans filamentation by regulating Cyr1 function, as well as
  through Cyr1-independent mechanisms.
