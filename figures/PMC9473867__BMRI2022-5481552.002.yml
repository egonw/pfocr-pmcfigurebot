caption: 'Hirudin''s inhibition towards the EMT of NRK-52E (rat renal tubular epithelial
  cells). (a) The protein expression conditions of fibronectin in 3 different groups
  revealed by immunofluorescence assay. (b) The protein expression conditions of N-cadherin
  in 3 different groups revealed by immunofluorescence assay. Scale bar: 50 μm. (c)
  The outcomes of average fluorescence intensity statistical parameters on fibronectin
  and N-cadherin proteins. ##compared with model, P < 0.01.'
