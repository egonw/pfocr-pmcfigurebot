figure_title: Ectopic GPNMB enhances M2 macrophage polarization by modulating key
  regulatory genes
caption: (a) Experimental scheme for differentiating murine bone marrow-derived cells
  (mBMDCs) into M1 and M2 macrophages, followed by LPS, IFNÎ³, and IL-4 treatment.
  (b) Quantitative PCR analysis shows significantly higher GPNMB expression in M2
  polarized macrophages than in M0 and M1. (c) Western blot confirming the increased
  protein levels of GPNMB in M2 macrophages across three independent experiments.
  (d)Ectopic expression of GPNMB in mBMDMs leads to the upregulation of M2-associated
  markers Arg1, Mrc1, and IL-4, with no significant effect on the M1 markers IL-6
  and Nos2. (e)Overexpression of GPNMB results in heightened expression of M2-related
  transcription factors Irf4 and Pparg, suggesting a potential pathway for GPNMB-mediated
  macrophage polarization.
