caption: HSF1 was the upstream regulator of AMPK/mTOR pathway(A) The mRNA expression
  levels of HSF1, AMPK, and mTOR in the cardiomyocytes of HSF1 overexpression group
  and its control group (Ad-HSF1 and Ad-NC), HSF1 knockdown group and its control
  group (si-HSF1 and si-NC) mice. (n = 3; SD; ∗∗∗p < 0.001) (B) Scatterplot of the
  correlation analysis between HSF1 and AMPK mRNA expression in mouse cardiomyocytes,
  measured by qPCR. (C) Punctate accumulation of GFP-LC3 in mouse cardiomyocytes at
  48 h in different treatment groups (Ad-NC, Ad-HSF1, si-NC, and si-HSF1). (D) Expression
  levels of HSF1, AMPK/mTOR pathway, autophagy-related protein p62, and LC3II/I in
  mouse cardiomyocytes. (E) Expression levels of HSF1 and AMPK proteins in mouse cardiomyocytes
  after overexpression and knockdown of AMPK (Ad-NC, Ad-AMPK, si-NC, and si-AMPK).
  (F) Expression levels of mTOR and autophagy-related proteins p62, LC3II/I in mouse
  cardiomyocytes after overexpression and knockdown of AMPK or HSF1 (Ad-HSF1, si-HSF1,
  Ad-AMPK, and si-AMPK).
