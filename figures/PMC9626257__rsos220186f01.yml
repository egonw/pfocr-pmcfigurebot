caption: PD-L1 and EMT dynamics occur on distinct time scales. (a) Schematic diagram
  of the signalling pathway regulating IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression. (b) Schematic
  diagram of the full model combining IFNγ-induced STAT signalling (left box), PD-L1
  expression (middle box) and the simplified TCS model for EMT dynamics (right box).
  (c)–(f) Temporal dynamics of separate models (boxes in (b)) without connection to
  the other parts. This includes IFNγ-induced STAT1 signalling (c) with IFNγ = 0.1
  nM, STAT1-induced PD-L1 expression (d) with STAT1p_2 = 430 nM and SNAIL1-induced
  EMT (f) with SNAIL1 = 2.3 × 105 molecules. The bifurcation diagram in (e) illustrates
  how EMT phenotype depends on the inducing signal in the TCS model (left, black lines).
  The eventual phenotype also depends on the initial state of the system, illustrated
  by temporal dynamics after a sudden increase in SNAIL1 from 2.0 × 105 molecules
  to 2.15 × 105 molecules given three different initial states (coloured lines).
