figure_title: DTL-ubiquitinated-RUVBL1 attenuates H4K16 acetylation-mediated HR repair
  pathway
caption: A The changes of H4K16ac level after high expression of RUVBL1 and DTL were
  detected by western blot. B The changes of H4K16Ac level after high expression of
  RUVBL1 and knockdown of DTL were detected by western blot. C The analysis of the
  interaction between RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 was carried out in MDA-MB-231-RUVBL1 cells
  using immunoprecipitation (IP) after 4 h of IR, and it was compared with IgG. D–F
  HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids prior to treatment with
  IR for 4 h before collection. The lysates were incubated with Myc antibody overnight
  and then subjected to western blot. G MDA-MB-231-RR cells were transfected with
  the shDTL plasmids prior to treatment with IR for 4 h before collection. The lysates
  were incubated with RUVBL1 antibody overnight and then subjected to western blot.
