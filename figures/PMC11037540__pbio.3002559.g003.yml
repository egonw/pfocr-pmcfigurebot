figure_title: Senescence is the immediate terminal fate of cell cycle gene reexpressing
  neurons
caption: (A) Dot plot showing the expression levels of cerebral cortex layer-specific
  markers among all excitatory neuron clusters. (B) Violin plots illustrating the
  expression levels of selected cerebral cortex layer-specific marker genes (highlighted
  in red in Fig 3A) in different subclusters. (C) t-SNE plot of excitatory neurons
  colored according to their cortical layer identity. NS = nonspecific. (D) Single-cell
  trajectory analysis with the Monocle 2.0 algorithm was used to determine the evolutionary
  relationship between the 2 subclusters of cell cycle gene-expressing neurons. The
  locations of subclusters 3 and 5 on this trajectory are labeled, with subcluster
  5 located at the terminal. Similar findings were observed when each dataset was
  separately analyzed, as presented in . (E) Heatmap showing the relative expression
  levels of 357 cell cycle-related genes among all the excitatory neuron clusters.
  Hierarchical clustering of these genes based on their expression levels resulted
  in 5 colored groups. Red- and yellow-colored gene clusters represent up-regulated
  cell cycle gene groups in clusters 5 and 3, respectively. (F) Functional pathway
  enrichment analyses of cell cycle gene clusters (red and yellow) with reference
  to the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) on the Enrich R platform [,]. (G)
  Gene set enrichment analysis of multiple gene sets related to senescence signatures
  and phenotypes in subcluster 5. (H) Metascape enrichment analysis of all the DEGs
  identified in subcluster 5 compared to the other excitatory neuronal populations.
  The functional pathways enriched in the up- and down-regulated DEGs are illustrated
  in blue and red, respectively. (I) TFs that regulate DEGs that do not match the
  inferred CNV regions in subcluster 5 were predicted based on the SCENIC analysis,
  as presented in  (). Manhattan plots illustrating the enriched signaling networks
  of coinhibited (top panel) or coactivated (bottom panel) TFs. Significantly (p <
  0.05) enriched networks are labeled. The metadata underlying this figure can be

  t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
