caption: 'Acetyl‐CoA accumulation by HK2 facilitates the enhancer and transcriptional
  activity of ACSL4. a) Schematic diagram shows the relationship of glycolysis, the
  TCA cycle, and the fatty acid synthetic process. b) Western blots measuring ACSL4
  protein levels in HUH7 (up) and C3A (down) cells transfected with NC, LDHA, ACLY,
  and ACC1 siRNAs. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. c) Measuring the amount
  of acetyl‐CoA in HUH7 and C3A cells after transfection with HK2 knockdown (left)
  or HK2 overexpression (right). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). One‐way
  ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. d) Upper: Real‐time qPCR showing ACSL4
  mRNA expression (relative to ACTB) in HUH7 and C3A cells after treatment with acetate
  as indicated above. Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). One‐way ANOVA
  with multiple comparisons correction. Down: Western blot measuring ACSL4 protein
  levels in HUH7 and C3A cells after treatment with acetate as indicated above. ACTIN
  was detected as a loading control. e) ChIP‐seq assays showing the H3K27ac peak at
  the promoter and enhancer regions of ACSL4 in the negative control (shNC) and HK2
  knockdown (shHK2) cells or control and acetate‐treated cells. The peaks of H3K4me3
  and H3K4me1 represent the promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. f) ChIP‐PCR
  showing H3K27ac enrichment (relative to 1% input) at the ACSL4 promoter (left) and
  enhancer (right) regions in HUH7 cells after HK2 knockdown. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. g)
  ChIP‐PCR showing H3K27ac enrichment (relative to 1% input) at the ACSL4 promoter
  (left) and enhancer (right) regions in HUH7 cells after treatment with acetate (5 ×
  10−3m). Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA with multiple
  comparisons correction. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.'
