caption: Unlike low-risk HBs, which harbor few genetic alterations outside of CTNNB1,
  our cohort revealed recurrent mutations, CNAs, and dysregulation of multiple cancer
  genes and pathways.(A) Consistent with previous reports, all tumors had alterations
  in Wnt-signaling pathway genes, including CTNNB1 and APC. In addition, we observed
  recurrent mutations and CNAs—defined as appearing in multiple patients—in genes
  and regions that are commonly altered in HCCs as well as genes that are associated
  with pluripotency signaling and common cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT and mTOR
  signaling. HBs were sorted by patient age at diagnosis; no significant associations
  between mutation rates or types with histological or clinical subtypes were observed.
  Mutated genes in each pathway are given in . (B) Unsupervised clustering of the
  expression profiles of non-cancer liver samples, HCCs, low-risk HBs, HCN NOS cases,
  and HB FPAs revealed clusters that are enriched with dysregulated genes from at
  least 4 cancer pathways. These included, from left to right, clusters composed of
  (1) all profiled HCCs and some older HB FPAs, and HCN NOS cases; (2) all profiled
  low-risk HBs and some HB FPAs and HCN NOS cases; (3) some older HB FPAs, and HCN
  NOS cases; and (4) non-tumor samples. Clusters 1-3 tumors had marked Wnt-signaling
  pathway activation even in tumors with no identified activating mutations in Wnt-signaling
  pathway genes. Cluster 2 tumors had lower GI and were seen in younger patients.
  Cluster 3 tumors had intermediate pathway activation compared to Cluster 1 tumors
  that showed high activation of NF-kB signaling and Cluster 2 tumors that showed
  high PIK-AKT signaling. Consequently, we labeled Cluster 1 HCC-like, Cluster 2 HB-like,
  Cluster-3 Intermediate (INTMD), and Cluster 4 Normal. Note that not all gene clusters
  were enriched for KEGG-pathway gene dysregulation. CNAs, copy number alterations;
  GI, genetic instability; HB, hepatoblastoma; HB FAPs, HBs demonstrating focal atypia
  or pleomorphism; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HCN NOS, hepatocellular neoplasm
  not otherwise specified; INTMD, Intermediate; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; WT, wild-type.
