caption: Statistical analysis of entries in AddictedChem. (A) Classification of controlled
  substances. (B) Number of controlled substances on different schedules. (C) Top
  10 scaffolds of controlled substances, namely, benzene (11.09%), 1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one
  (3.54%), 4-phenylpiperidine (3.38%), 4-anilino-N-phenethyl-piperidine (3.38%), and
  acyclic (2.25%), diphenylmethane (2.25%), barbituric acid (1.71%), unnamed compound
  (1.61%), 1,3-benzodioxole (1.45%), unnamed compound (1.45%). The numbers indicate
  the frequency of occurrence of the scaffolds, and the percentage values are the
  ratio of every scaffold to 622 scaffolds. (D) Binding protein target ranking according
  to the number of controlled substances in the BindingDB database. (E) Controlled
  substances ranking according to the number of binding protein targets in the BindingDB
  database. (F) Pathway analysis of controlled substances. These pathways are from
  KEGG drug development class, and the numbers indicate the number of controlled substances.
