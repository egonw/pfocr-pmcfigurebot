caption: Tumor IFI35 correlates with CD8+ T cells expression and patient outcome.
  A Screening of CTL function-correlated genes associated with good prognosis in human
  colorectal cancer. In the TCGA dataset, 412 top genes were identified as positively
  correlated with Cytolytic Activity (CYT) Score in pan-cancer using Spearman correlation
  analysis. Among the shared 412 genes, based on our own CRC proteomics, 19 proteins
  were identified to be correlated with CTL function signature on the protein level
  using Spearman correlation analysis. The proteomic analysis detected 6 out of 19
  proteins with a good prognosis in CRC through Kaplan–Meier analysis. B, C IFI35
  expression in normal colorectal tissues and colorectal cancer tissues. B Statistical
  analysis of IFI35 mRNA levels of 66 paired samples of CRC and adjacent normal tissues
  from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital (n = 66, non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs
  signed rank test, p < 0.01). C IFI35 protein expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma
  tissues (n = 90) and normal colorectal tissues (n = 30). Two tailed t-tests, p < 0.
  01. D–G Kaplan–Meier analyses of the association of overall survival with IFI35
  proteins. D Overall survival analysis in CRC with low (n = 14) and high (n = 101)
  levels of IFI35 in 115 CRC patients from our CRC proteomics datasets, E overall
  survival analysis in CRC with low (n = 81) and high (n = 64) levels of IFI35 in
  145 CRC patients from Shanghai’ proteomics datasets, F overall survival analysis
  in CRC with low (n = 69) and high (n = 487) levels of IFI35 in 556 CRC patients
  from GSE39582, G overall survival analysis in CRC with low (n = 85) and high (n = 105)
  levels of IFI35 in 190 CRC patients from GSE87211. Log-rank test. The optimal cutoff
  values were calculated by the X-tile software. H, I Expression of IFI35 protein
  and its prognostic value in CRC. H The expression of IFI35 in CRC was detected by
  Fluorescent Immunohistochemistry analysis based on tissue microarray. I Patients
  with high expression of IFI35 (n = 80) showed better overall survival time than
  the patients with low expression of IFI35 (n = 89). J, K Relationship between IFI35
  expression and immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma patients. J Overall survival analysis
  in melanoma with low (n = 21) and high (n = 20) levels of IFI35 treated with Anti-PD1
  therapy. K Progression-free survival was analyzed and compared between patients
  with low (n = 8) and high (n = 7) levels of IFI35 in melanoma patients treated with
  Anti-CTLA4 therapy. Log-rank test
