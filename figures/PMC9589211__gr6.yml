caption: 'The immune landscape and immunotherapeutic responses among three subclasses(A)
  An overview of the GPS score, immune cells, checkpoint targets and cytokines in
  three subclasses.(B) The stacked column charts of immune cell fraction in GPA, GPB
  and GPC.(C) The boxplots depicting difference of BMDM and MG enrichment score among
  three subclasses.(D) The scatterplot of M1 and M2 phenotypes from BMDM and MG based
  on scRNA-seq data.(E) Violin plot showing the enrichment scores of immunosuppressive
  expression signatures, including PTEN pathway, induced regulatory T cells, and FOXO3
  proteins. BMDM, Bone marrow-derived macrophage; MG, Microglia; ANOVA was used to
  compare groups. ∗: p < 0.05, ∗∗: p < 0.01, ∗∗∗: p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001, NS,
