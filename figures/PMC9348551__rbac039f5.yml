caption: D-Gel enhanced HDPCs odontogenic differentiation through MAPK-ERK1/2 and
  TGF-β/smad signaling pathway. (A, B) The protein expression of DSPP and ALP of HDPCs
  treated with D-gel and U0126 for 7 and 14 days (n = 3). (C, D) The quantitative
  protein analysis of DSPP and ALP. (E) Alizarin red staining of HDPCs treated with
  D-gel and U0126 for 21 days (n = 3). (F) The quantitative analysis of alizarin red
  staining. (G, H) The protein expression of smad2/3 and p-smad2/3 after being treated
  with D-gel and U0126 for 7 and 14 days (n = 3). (I, J) The quantitative protein
  analysis of p-smad2/3. The data were presented as means ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
