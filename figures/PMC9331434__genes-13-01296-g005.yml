caption: GO and KEGG bubble of mutant genes of analyzed samples. (A) Bubble plot of
  the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showing the top 9 significant pathways. Bubble color
  and size correspond to the P-value and gene number enriched in the pathway. (B)
  Bubble plot of the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis showing
  the top 10 significant pathways. Bubble color and size correspond to the P-value
  and gene number enriched in the pathway.
