figure_title: SV normalized dendritic outgrowth of DCX immature neurons in APP mice
caption: A Schematic representation of experimental design and timeline of SV treatment.
  B DCX-positive immature neurons were visualized by DAB immunohistochemistry in the
  DG of WT, APP, and WT and APP mice treated with SV (WTSV and APPSV). C The black
  box in the top panel indicates the target area for measuring the thickness of the
  molecular layer (ML) of the DG. The ML in APP mice was statistically thinner than
  that of WT mice, and there was no difference between treated and untreated animals
  (D left panel). After correcting for the reduced thickness of the ML, the maximum
  length of DCX-immunostained dendritic extensions was shorter in APP mice compared
  to WT (D right panel), a deficit that was fully corrected by SV treatment that promoted
  extension of the DCX dendrites in treated APP mice to levels comparable to WT (D
  right panel). Scale bars = 200 µm. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, using
  two-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post-hoc test.
