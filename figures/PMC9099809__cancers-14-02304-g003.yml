caption: MEOX2 knock down in glioblastoma stem cells differentially modulates gene
  expression in different cells, but consistently affects some subsets. (a,b) Venn
  diagrams showing the numbers and percentages of DEGs (absolute log2 fold change
  ≥ 0.7, adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) in BT273 or BT379 cells transduced with either shRNA18
  or shRNA53, compared to the same cell types transduced with a negative control.
  Panel a shows the downregulated genes, and panel b the upregulated ones. Each diagram
  is flanked, on the left, by the list of genes consistently modulated in all three
  conditions, i.e., BT273 shRNA 18, BT273 shRNA53, BT379 shRNA18.
