caption: 'Effect on miR-145-5p in hBMECs after treatment with thrombin. (A) Cell morphology
  changes after 24 h incubation with thrombin (10, 20 U/mL) were observed by light
  microscopy (400× magnification, scale bar: 50 µm). (B) Cells treated with 10 and
  20 U/mL of thrombin for 24 h, and relative expression of miR-145-5p measured by
  RT-PCR. After treatment with 20 U/mL of thrombin, along with mimics NC or miR-145-5p
  mimics, cell viability (C), apoptosis (D), and apoptosis-related proteins Bax, Bcl-2,
  and cleaved-caspase 3 (E) in hBMECs were determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and
  western blot. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *, P<0.05; ***, P<0.001. hBMECs,
  human brain microvascular endothelial cells; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction; NC, negative control; SD, standard deviation; HICH, hypertensive
  intracerebral hemorrhage; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
