caption: (A,B)—Volcano plot of the differentially abundant metabolites at Kulazhin
  (A) and Masany (B) compared to the control (L + B) with cut-offs for fold change
  |FC| > 2 and a p-value of < 0.05. Blue—downregulated metabolites, grey—non-significant,
  red—upregulated metabolites. (C) Plots depict several metabolic pathway alterations
  induced by chronic radiation exposure on experimental plots. The x-axis represents
  the pathway impact value from pathway topological analysis, and the y-axis is the
  −log of the p-value obtained from pathway enrichment analysis. Larger—log(p) and
  impact values characterised the most significantly changed pathways.
