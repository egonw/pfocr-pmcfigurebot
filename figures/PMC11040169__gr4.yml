caption: 'Genistein enhances adiponectin secretion by activating the ERβ-Erk-PPARγ
  signaling pathway in chicken adipocytes. ICP-1 cells were pretreated with vehicle,
  Erk inhibitor U0126 (10 μM; 4h) or PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (5 μM; 4h), respectively;
  then, the cells were treated with 0 or 40 μM GEN for another 24 h. (A) Immunoblot
  of p-Erk, t-Erk, PPARγ, and Tublin β protein; (B–C) The protein levels of p-Erk/t-Erk
  and PPARγ (n = 3); D: APN mRNA level (n = 3); (E) Immunoblot of PPARγ and Tublin
  β protein; (F) PPARγ protein levels (n = 3); (G) APN mRNA level (n = 3); (H) APN
  concentration in the culture medium supernatant of ICP-1 cells (n = 6). Data are
  expressed as means ± SEM. ** P < 0.01, comparison with the respective control groups;
  NS P > 0.05 no significant difference, comparison between the indicated groups.'
