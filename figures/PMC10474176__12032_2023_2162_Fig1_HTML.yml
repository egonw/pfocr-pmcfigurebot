caption: Transcriptional expression of UBA3 in human cancers. A UBA3 expression across
  different cancer types was investigated using the TIMER2.0 database. B The level
  of expression of UBA3 was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues (n = 515)
  compared to adjacent normal tissues (n = 59) in samples from the UALCAN database.
  C No significant differences were found in the levels of UBA3 expression between
  lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues (n = 503) and adjacent normal tissues
  (n = 52) using data from the UALCAN database (* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  n.s., no significant difference)
article_title: The NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 UBA3 orchestrates the immunosuppressive
  microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma via the NF-кB pathway.
