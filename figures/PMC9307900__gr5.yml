caption: AptTNF-α regulated TNF-α-mediated necroptosis via RIP1/RIP3/MLKL signalling
  pathway. A,B,C, the mRNA levels of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL gene were measured by RT-PCR
  after incubation with TNF-α and AptTNF-α for 24 ​h (n ​= ​3, each group was repeated
  from three batches of samples for analysis). ∗p ​< ​0.05. D, Expression level of
  RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, along with their phosphorylated proteins in the BMECs examined
  by the Western blotting. E,F,G,H, the relative protein level of GAPDH, p-RIP1/RIP1,
  p-RIP3/RIP3 and p-MLKL/MLKL from the Western blotting analysis, respectively. The
  ratio of p-RIP1/RIP1, p-RIP3/RIP3 and p-MLKL/MLKL was normalized to GAPDH (n ​= ​3,
  each group was repeated from three batches of samples for analysis). ∗p ​< ​0.05.
  BMEC, bone microvascular endothelial cell. AptTNF-α, TNF-α aptamer. Apt 100, 100 ​nM
  TNF-α aptamer. Apt 500, 500 ​nM TNF-α aptamer.
