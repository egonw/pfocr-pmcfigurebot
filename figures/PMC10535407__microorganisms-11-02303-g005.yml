caption: Acetic acid metabolic pathway and acetic acid synthesis. (A) Acetic acid
  metabolism pathway of Bacillus licheniformis. (B) Determination of transcriptional
  intensity of acetic acid metabolic pathway. (C) The content of acetic acid in the
  culture medium was determined. (D) Conversion rate of glucose to acetic acid of
  Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus licheniformis CA cultured with different concentrations
  of glucose at 12 h. Statistical comparisons were performed using two-sided Studentâ€™s
  t-test (*** p < 0.001).
