caption: ILF3 promotes gastric cancer cells proliferation, cell cycle, migration,
  and invasion, and statins may exert an anti-tumor effect by inhibiting ILF3 expression
  in gastric cancer. (A) Statins inhibited the expression of ILF3 in a concentration-dependent
  manner, the optimal concentration was 40&mu;mol/L. The protein expression of ILF3
  was significantly downregulated with ILF3-specific small interference RNA (si-ILF3)
  and statin treatment compared to control group. The expression level of ILF3 was
  analyzed with western blot. (B) Edu assay analyzed the effects of ILF3 on cell proliferation
  of gastric cancer cells. ILF3-specific small interference RNA (si-ILF3) and statins
  treatment inhibited the proliferation of HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells compared to control
  group. (C) The protein expression of PCNA was lower expressed in the ILF3-specific
  small interference and statins treatment groups compared to control group. (D) Flow
  cytometry analyzed the effect of ILF3 on cell cycle of gastric cancer cells. ILF3-specific
  small interference RNA (si-ILF3) and statins treatment inhibited the cell cycle
  of HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells compared to control group. (E) The protein expression
  of cyclin-D1 was lower expressed in the ILF3-specific small interference and statins
  treatment groups compared to control group. (F) Transwell assay analyzed the effect
  of ILF3 on cell migration and invasion. ILF3-specific small interference RNA (si-ILF3)
  and statins treatment inhibited the migration and invasion of HGC-27 and Ncl-N87
  cells compared to control group. (G) The protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
  lower expressed in the ILF3-specific small interference and statins treatment groups
  compared to control group. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
