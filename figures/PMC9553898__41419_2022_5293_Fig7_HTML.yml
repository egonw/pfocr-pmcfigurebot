caption: 'A The breeding strategy used to generate Rictor cKO female mice. B Expression
  of Rictor was quantified using qPCR in the vagina of control (n = 6) and Rictor
  cKO (n = 5) mice. C Rictor protein levels in control (n = 4) and Rictor cKO (n = 4)
  vagina tissues were determined by immunoblotting. β-Actin was used as the loading
  control. The experiments were repeated two times. D Gross morphology of external
  vaginal orifice and reproductive tracts of control (n = 5) and Rictor cKO (n = 5)
  mice. E 3D renderings of the female reproductive tract in control (n = 4) and Rictor
  cKO (n = 4) mice based on MRI T2 weighted images. Scale bars: 5 mm. F Accurate max
  and min diameters of the vagina were measured based on E. Values are expressed as
  the mean ± SEM. G Representative images for cytological assessment of vaginal smears
  of control and Rictor cKO mice using crystal violet staining method for estrous
  cycle determination. n = 5 mice in each group. Microscopy with magnification ×20.
  Scale bars: 100 μm. H Representative HE-stained vaginal sections of OVX control
  and Rictor cKO mice are shown. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. n = 3 mice
  in each group. The experiments were repeated three times. Microscopy with magnification
  ×20. Scale bars: 50 μm.'
