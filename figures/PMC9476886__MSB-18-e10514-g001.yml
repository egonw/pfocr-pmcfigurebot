figure_title: TAX‐6/Calcineurin is required for exact adaptation and habituation
caption: 'A Response dynamics of wt, tax‐6(p675), and tax‐6(p675) + AWA::TAX‐6 worms
  to a two‐step protocol: First step consisting of 5 min (bottom panels,  worms respectively)
  or 1 min (top panel,  wt worms. Biological replicates) of on step, followed by a
  2 min, or 6 min off step, respectively, before applying a second short step (right
  panels). Wt worms exposed to the 5‐min step showed stronger habituation compared
  to worms exposed to the 1‐min‐long step (, Wilcoxon rank‐sum test between the amplitudes
  of the second steps). Steps are aligned to the maximal amplitude (at time 0).B,
  C Median neural activity (B) and normalized neural activity (C) of wt, tax‐6(p675),
  and tax‐6(p675) + AWA::TAX‐6 worms in response to the first step. Fitting the pulse
  decay with an exponent of the shape , tax‐6 mutants showed a longer decay time than
  wt worms, suggesting slower adaptation dynamics ( of  and  s, respectively, Wilcoxon
  rank‐sum test, ).  of the rescue line was  s, which was not significantly different
  from wt (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test, ). Color‐shaded area marks mean absolute deviation.D
  Comparison of the amplitudes in the first and the second step for wt, tax‐6(p675),
  and tax‐6(p675) + AWA::TAX‐6 worms (following the longer 5‐min step). All three
  strains showed a weaker activity in the second step (signed‐rank test, , respectively),
  with tax‐6(p675) worms having a significantly higher amplitude than wt in both the
  first and second steps (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test,  and  respectively). Black bars
  mark the median. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005.E The difference between the
  response amplitudes of the first and the second steps as a function of the first‐step
  amplitude. While wt worms show a higher amplitude difference when the response to
  the first step is stronger (), tax‐6(p675) mutants do not (r = 0.1, P = 0.78), suggesting
  that calcium influx affects habituation in wt worms but not in tax‐6(p675) mutants.
  The linear dependency in the rescued animals (tax‐6(p675) + AWA::TAX‐6) is higher
  than in tax‐6 mutants, though the correlation is not significant ().  Source data
  are available online for this figure.'
