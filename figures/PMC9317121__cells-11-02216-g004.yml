caption: Diagram representing the structure of dimeric BMPs. (a) The BMP-2 monomer
  fold represents the α-helices and β-sheets shown by spiral and arrows, respectively.
  The BMP-2 cystine knot constitutes the core of the monomer and consists of three
  disulfide bonds (“S”); two, Cys-325-Cys-393 and Cys-329-Cys-325, form a ring through
  which the third, Cys-296-Cys-361, passes. The strands of antiparallel β-sheets of
  β1 to β9, which emit from the knot, form two fingerlike projections. An α-helix,
  located on the opposite end of the knot, lies perpendicular to the axis of the two
  fingers, thus forming the heel of the hand. The N terminus corresponds to the thumb
  of the hand (adapted from Carreira et al., 2014, ref. []). (b) The dimeric structure
  of BMP-2. Each monomer is indicated by one color (green and orange), with the disulfide
  bridges being denoted by projections of the cysteine (yellow) side chains (adapted
  with permission from Scheufler et al., 1999., ref. []). The color figure is available
