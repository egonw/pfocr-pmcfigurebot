caption: Common and specific molecular features of LP and morphea cGVHD. GSEA for
  “hallmark gene set” for LP (n = 8) vs healthy controls (CONT, n = 6) (A) and for
  morphea (n = 5) vs CONT (n = 6) (B). (C-D) Relevant canonical pathways using IPA
  differentiating (C) LP (n = 8) vs control (CONT) and (D) morphea (n = 5) cGVHD skin
  lesions VS CONT (n = 6). Pathways identified are represented on the y-axis. The
  x-axis corresponds to the –log of the P value. Orange, z-score value is positive
  (>0), pathway is predicted to be activated; blue, z-score value is negative (<0),
  pathway is predicted to be inhibited; gray, no activity pattern available. (E) Volcano
  plot with log2FC and −log10 P values for the DEGs comparing LP (n = 8) vs morphea
  (n = 5) chronic cGVHD skin lesions. The most statistically significant genes are
  toward the top and are depicted in red. Genes of interest are encircled. (F) Relevant
  canonical pathways using IPA differentiating LP (n = 8) vs morphea (n = 5) cGVHD
  skin lesions, with upregulated DEGs in the TREM1 signaling pathway. Pathways identified
  are represented on the y-axis. The x-axis corresponds to the –log of the P value.
  Orange, z-score value is positive (>0), pathway is predicted to be activated; blue,
  z-score value is negative (<0), pathway is predicted to be inhibited; gray, no activity
  pattern available.
