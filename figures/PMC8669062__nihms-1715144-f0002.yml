figure_title: Actin influences BCR signaling at multiple stages of early B cell activation
  by using distinct mechanisms
caption: (A) Transient depolymerization of cortical actin induced by BCR-antigen interaction
  releases BCR from actin-mediated confinement. (B) Actin drives B cell spreading
  and enhances the mobility and inter-mixing of BCR and CD19, leading to amplification
  of BCR signaling. (C) Actin drives B cell contraction, merging BCR microclusters
  and reducing their mobility, which downregulates BCR signaling. (D) BCR internalization
  of antigen via the clathrin-dependent pathway requires F-actin at the membrane fission
  step. Clathrin-independent antigen uptake requires actomyosin mediated mechanical
  force and extracellular enzymatic cleavage. (E) The Kinetics Panel shows an approximation
  of the kinetics (increasing and decreasing mean fluorescence intensity in the B
  cell contact zone) of some signaling molecules and actin-related proteins in mouse
  splenic B cells activated on anti-Ig coated PLBs. The kinetics scheme is based on
  data that utilize the same model and mode of stimulation [, , ].
