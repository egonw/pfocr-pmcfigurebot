caption: Clinical association of MYH9 in HNC patients. (A) Differential expression
  of MYH9 in HNC and normal tissues, as determined using TCGA-HNSC datasets. (B) Prognostic
  significance of MYH9 in HNC patients, as determined using the TCGA-HNSC dataset
  by the KM plotter method (n = 500). The survival curve, hazard ratio (HR), and p-value
  are indicated. (C) A molecular model representing MYH9 regulatory mechanism resulting
  in cell invasion and radioresistance in HNC cells. MYH9 activates the pan-MAPK signaling
  molecules, including Erk, p38, and JNK. This activation leads to the induction of
  Nrf2 transcriptional activity, the upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes, and
  the reduction of cellular ROS levels. The antioxidant enzyme, such as GCLC, further
  confers cell invasion and radioresistance, resulting in aggressive cancer and poor
  prognosis. Taken together, MYH9 exerts malignant effects in HNC via regulating cellular
  ROS levels by activating the MAPK-Nrf2-GCLC signaling pathway.
