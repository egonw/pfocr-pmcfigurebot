caption: Simvastatin affected gene expression of human astrocytes (T98G) in a Nurr1‐dependent
  manner. a,b) Differentially expressed genes for simvastatin (SIM, 10 × 10−6m) versus
  DMSO treatment in nt siRNA‐treated or Nurr1‐silenced T98G cells without (a) and
  with (b) additional lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐stimulation. Genes regulated in nt
  siRNA‐treated and Nurr1‐silenced cells are gray, genes regulated only in nt siRNA‐treated
  but not in Nurr1‐silenced cells are red (induction) or green (downregulation). Volcano
  plots show log2fold change in gene expression level (x‐axis) versus statistical
  significance level (‐log10(p‐value); y‐axis), n = 3. c) Coexpression Venn diagrams
  show effects of SIM versus DMSO treatment in nt siRNA‐treated versus Nurr1‐silenced
  T98G cells with or without additional LPS‐stimulation. d) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis demonstrates effects of Nurr1 activation by SIM on the expression of genes
  related to cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis as
  well as the neurodegenerative diseases AD and PD. Bar plot shows statistical significance
  level (‐log10(padj)) of regulated KEGG pathways, numbers refer to the count of differentially
  expressed genes related to the pathway. n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
  e,f) Selected genes that were regulated by SIM versus DMSO treatment without (e)
  or with (f) additional LPS‐stimulation in nt siRNA‐treated cells whose expression
  was unaffected in Nurr1 siRNA‐treated cells. Only selected genes related to neuroprotection
  and neuroinflammation are shown, further regulated genes in Tables  and  of the
  Supporting Information. Heatmap shows log2fold change in gene expression.
