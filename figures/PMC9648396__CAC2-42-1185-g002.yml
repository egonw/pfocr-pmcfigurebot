caption: 'Elevated AIMP1 increases acetyl‐H3 enrichment function of GAREM2. (A) Schematic
  of the CHIP‐seq procedure. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of the data obtained from CHIP‐seq.
  (C) Heatmap of the acetyl‐H3‐mediated enrichment function of 10 genes, including
  GAREM2, in AIMP1‐OE and AIMP1‐WT cells. (D) Genome browser view of acetyl‐H3 signaling
  on GAREM2 in AIMP1‐OE and AIMP1‐WT cells. (E) ChIP‐qPCR showed increased acetyl‐H3
  enrichment function of GAREM2 in AIMP1‐OE cells compared with AIMP1‐WT cells. (F)
  siGAREM2 downregulated p‐ERK1/2 expression. (G) MTT assay tested the effects of
  siGAREM2 on cell proliferation. Data are presented as the mean ± SD; *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Abbreviations: AIMP1: Aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetase‐interacting
  multifunctional protein 1; GAREM2: GRB2‐associated and regulator of MAPK protein
  2; CHIP‐seq: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and next‐generation sequencing; OE: Overexpression;
  WT: Wild type; KD: Knockdown; p‐ERK1/2: Phosphorylated extracellular‐regulated kinase
  1/2; ERK1/2: Extracellular‐regulated kinase 1/2'
