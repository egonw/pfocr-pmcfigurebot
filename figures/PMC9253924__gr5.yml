caption: (A) Collagen deposition in liver sinusoids and periportal fibrosis (Black
  arrow heads) was observed in injury groups at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared to VC
  group (40X microphotographs). (B) mRNA expression of Col-1α showing continuous increase
  in collagen expression in injury groups at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared to VC groups.
  (C) Relative expression of mRNA of α-Sma significantly increased at 21 W injury
  group. The graphical data presented in mean ± S.D.
