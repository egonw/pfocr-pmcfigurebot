caption: Kaplan-Meier survival curves presenting prognostic relationships between
  high and low expressions of specific micro (mi)RNAs to overall survival (OS) using
  the GSE29623 database patient samples. (a) Venn plot method for prediction of miRNAs
  (b) miR-7-5p, (c) miR-20a-3p, and (d) miR-636 expressions. Survival curves were
  plotted using SPSS 22.0. Specific miRNA expression levels were selected by the median
  value. Results are visually presented by Kaplan-Meier survival plots, and p values
  were calculated using log-rank statistics. Patient number(n) = 65;p = log‐rank pvalue,
  withp < 0.05considered significant.
