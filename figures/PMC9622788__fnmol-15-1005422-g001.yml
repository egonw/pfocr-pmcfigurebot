caption: The necroptosis involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI). After TBI occurs,
  the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway is activated, in which the Nec-1, Mel, 2-BFI, CYLD,
  and CHMP4B can alleviate the necroptosis and protect the neural function by inhibiting
  the RIP1 and RIP3. Hydrogen-rich saline can inhibit the RIP1 and RIP3 through the
  ROS/HO-1 pathway. While RIP1 can inhibit the oxidative stress and the apoptosis
  which occurred after TBI through the AMPK signal pathway. Perampanel can inhibit
  the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway through the AKT/GSK3Î² pathway, thereby alleviating
  the necroptosis.
