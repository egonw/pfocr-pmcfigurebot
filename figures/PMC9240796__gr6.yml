caption: Myriocin treatment decreases ubiquitination of HIF1α(A) Diagram of HIF1α
  expression regulated post-transcriptionally during normoxia. Stimulation of the
  PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways increases the level of HIF1α by enhancing its translation.
  Ubiquitination of HIF1α promotes its degradation by proteasomes.(B) Western blotting
  analysis of HIF1α protein in HT22 cells treated with myriocin (0.5 μM) in the presence
  or absence of LY294002 (10 μM), AZD5363 (5 μM), or rapamycin (1 μM) for 36 h. Error
  bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 3, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(C) Proteins of interest were
  analyzed by Western blotting after HT22 cells were treated with or without myriocin
  (0.5 μM).(D) Western blotting analysis of HIF1α protein in HT22 cells treated with
  or without myriocin (0.5 μM) in the presence or absence of MG132 (10 nM, 36 h).(E)
  Ubiquitin/HIF1α co-immunoprecipitation in HT22 cell extracts. Cells treated with
  or without myriocin (0.5 μM) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1α antibody
  or normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) as negative control. The immunocomplexes were then
  immunoblotted using anti-ubiquitin or anti-HIF1α antibody (Output). The levels of
  HIF1α in cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were also monitored (Input).
