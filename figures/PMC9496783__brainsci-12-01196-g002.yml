caption: Display of cell types, marker genes, and the extraction of MG1. (a) TSNE
  plot showing 60, 137 cells, mainly for 7 cell types to color. (b) Cell type marker
  gene bubble plot, the size of the bubbles indicates the proportion of genes, from
  black to yellow indicates low to high gene expression. (c) Box plot showed the proportion
  of each cell cluster and was split by the control and AD samples (“**” represents
  a p-value of <0.05, “***” represents a p-value of <0.005, “ns” represents a p-value
  of >0.05). (d) DO enrichment analysis of MG1 cluster with −log(p) values on the
  horizontal axis and the pathway list on the vertical axis.
