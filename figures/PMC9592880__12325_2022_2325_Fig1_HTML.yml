caption: Proposed clinical care pathway for patients with T2D that could be discussed
  during a clinic visit. (i) Prevention, screening, and CKD progression control [,
  ]. aNo more than one alcoholic drink per day for adult women and no more than two
  drinks per day for adult men []. bGLP-1 receptor agonists and/or SGLT-2 inhibitors
  with or without metformin depending on glycemic control needs, with or at high risk
  of CVD and/or CKD. c50–76% reduction DCCT with A1C of 7.0% vs 9.0%; 25% reduction
  UKPDS with A1C of 7% vs 7.9%. The 2022 ADA guidelines and 2020 KDIGO guidelines
  recommend an A1C goal of < 7% and a range of < 6.5% to < 8.0%, respectively [, ].

  Published by Elsevier Inc). The eGFR and albuminuria grid notes the risk of progression,
  morbidity, and mortality by color, from best to worst (green, yellow, orange, red,
  dark red). Green can reflect CKD with normal eGFR and UACR in the presence of other
  markers of kidney damage (e.g., imaging showing polycystic kidney disease or kidney
  biopsy abnormalities), with yearly follow-ups; yellow requires caution and measurements
  at least once per year; orange requires measurements twice per year; red requires
  measurements three times per year; and dark red requires measurements four times
  per year. However, the approach should be patient-centered on the basis of underlying
  comorbid conditions and disease state. Patients may be referred (nephrology; depending
  on local arrangements) if there is significant albuminuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/g) and/or
  a severely decreased eGFR (≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) []. ACEi angiotensin-converting
