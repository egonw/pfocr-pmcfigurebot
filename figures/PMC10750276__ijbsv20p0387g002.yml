caption: KLF7 promotes the proliferation and migration of COAD cells in vitro. (A,
  B) Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the transient upregulation
  of KLF7 expression in SW620 cells, as well as the transient silencing of KLF7 expression
  in LoVo cells (n=3). A representative blot was shown. (C, D) MTT assays were used
  to plot growth curves (n=3). (E, F) Representative images of colony formation assays
  and corresponding colony counts (n=3). (G, H) Wound-healing assays were performed
  on the COAD cell lines (n=3). (I, J) Migration assays were performed on the COAD
  cell lines (n=3). (K, L) Western blot analysis of EMT signaling pathways in indicated
  COAD cells. Representative blot was shown. Bar, 200 µm (G, H) or 100 µm (I, J).
