caption: Differential expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  oxidase (NOX) during suramin-induced differentiation of primary chondrocytes. a)
  and c) The chondrocytes were treated with 10 μM suramin for 16 hours. Then we measured
  Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, p47, p67, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh)
  messenger RNA (mRNA) levels using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
  (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). b) and d) Total cell lysates were analyzed
  by western blot with specific antibodies as indicated. e) pEGFP-p67 plasmid was
  transciently transfected into chondrocytes and incubated with or without 10 mM of
  suramin. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and permeabilized with
  Triton X-100. The images were observed with an immunofluoresence microscope through
  a 40× objective. f) Cells were treated with 10 μM suramin for 30 and 60 minutes.
  The cytoplasmic and membrane protein fractionations were collected as described
  in the Methods section to detect p67 phox expression by western blot. g) and h)
  The chondrocytes were transfected with NOX2 or p67phox luciferase plasmid, respectively,
  and then incubated with 10 μM suramin for different times as indicated. The luciferase
  activity was determined and normalized with the amount of total protein. Values
  are means and standard deviations of triplicate measurements. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
  compared with untreated control. C, control.
