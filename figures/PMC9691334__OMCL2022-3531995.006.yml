caption: 'TF3 fails to reverse RSL3-induced ferroptosis in chondrocytes. (a) Chondrocyte
  viability was measured by MTS. (b) Chondrocyte ferroptosis was detected by PI staining;
  representative images are shown. (c) Quantitative analysis of PI positive percentage.
  (d) Lipid ROS levels were evaluated by fluorescent staining; representative images
  are shown. (e) Quantitative analysis of lipid ROS levels in chondrocytes. (f) The
  Fe2+ levels in mitochondria were detected by Mito-Ferrogreen staining; representative
  images are shown. (g) Quantitative analysis of Fe2+ level. (h) The levels of FTH-1,
  Gpx4, HO-1, Slc7a11 and Nrf2 were measured by western blot; representative bands
  are shown. (i) Quantitative analysis for the expression of FTH-1, Gpx4, HO-1, Slc7a11,
  and Nrf2 in chondrocytes. The quantitative results are presented as the means ±
  SD of three independent experiments, and statistical significance was determined
  by one-way ANOVA. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; n.s.: no significant difference.
  NC: chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM-F12 for 24 hrs. RSL3: chondrocytes were pretreated
  with TF3 for 2 hours and then stimulated with RSL3(10 μM) for 12 hrs. FTH-1: ferritin
  heavy chain 1; Gpx4: glutathione peroxidase 4; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; Slc7a11:
  light chain subunit of the cystine/glutamate anticarrier; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2.'
