caption: Cell viability assay. (A) Effects of lead on cell viability in PC12 cells.
  PC12 cells were incubated with lead (0–160 μM) for 24 h. (B–D) Effects of BSP1,
  BSP3, and BSP4 cell viability in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were incubated with (B)
  BSP1, (C) BSP3, and (D) BSP4 for 4 h. (E) Effects of BSP1–5 on cell viability in
  lead-exposed PC12 cells. PC12 cells were preincubated with BSP1–5 (200 μM) for 4
  h, then treated with 10 μM lead for 24 h. The value of the bars indicate the means
  ± SD (n = at least 3). The same letter means there is no significant difference,
  and different letters mean there is a significant difference (p < 0.05).
