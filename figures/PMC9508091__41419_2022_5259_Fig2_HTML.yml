figure_title: The de novo hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and GlcNAc salvage
  pathway integrate metabolic status from core metabolism intermediates, including
  glycolysis, fatty acid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, to generate uridine
  diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)
caption: Approximately 2â€“5% of cellular glucose enters the HBP to generate the end
  product UDP-GlcNAc. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) is the
  rate-limiting enzyme for the HBP. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) adds UDP-GlcNAc to
  target protein serine and threonine residues, and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes O-GlcNAc
  from O-GlcNAcylated proteins. The balance between the enzyme activities of phosphofructokinase
  (PFK) and GFAT through regulating GFAT may be crucial to direct the pathways. G6P
