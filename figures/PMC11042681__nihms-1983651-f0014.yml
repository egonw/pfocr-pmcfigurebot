figure_title: m6A landscape analyses of established T1D reveal differential methylation
  of master regulators of β-cell identity and function (related to )
caption: 'a, Venn diagram representation of the m6A hypermethylated, m6A hypomethylated,
  upregulated, or downregulated genes in human islets from patients with established
  T1D or non-diabetic Controls. Statistical analyses were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg
  procedure and genes were filtered for FDR<0.05. Human islets: Controls n = 20 and
  T1D n = 7 biologically independent samples. b-e, Pathway enrichment analyses of
  m6A hypermethylated and upregulated (a), m6A hypermethylated and downregulated (c),
  m6A hypomethylated and upregulated (d), or m6A hypomethylated and downregulated
  genes (e) in human islets from established T1D compared to Controls. P values of
  pathway enrichment analysis were calculated according to the hypergeometric test
  based on the number of physical entities present in both the predefined set and
  user-specified list of physical entities. Source numerical data are available in
  source data.'
