caption: Effects of HSYA in 90% GCH on serum metabolites against HFD-induced obesity.
  (A) PCA score plot of the three groups and QC samples. (B) PCA score plot (group
  HFD vs 90% GCH). (C) PLS-DA score plot (group HFD vs 90% GCH). Volcano plots of
  differential metabolites (D) between groups H2O and HFD and (E) between groups 90%
  GCH and HFD. (F) Hierarchical clustering analysis of differential metabolites among
  the three groups. (G) Pathway analysis of metabolic variations with MetPA.
