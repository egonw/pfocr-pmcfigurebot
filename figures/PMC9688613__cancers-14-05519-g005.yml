caption: Apoptotic patterns of OSCC cells treated with CLEFMA. (A) HSC-3 and (B) SCC-9
  cells were treated with 0–8 μM CLEFMA. Western blot analysis was performed. β-actin
  was used as a loading control. Proteins signals were visualised with an ECL imaging
  system. Quantitative analyses were obtained from three independent experiments and
  expressed as mean ± SD. * represent p < 0.05 as compared with the control.
