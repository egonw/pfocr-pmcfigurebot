caption: OEA inhibited high glucose and OGD/R-induced apoptosis of cells by regulating
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (A–C) The expression levels of P85 and P-Akt in
  cardiomyocytes induced by high glucose and OGD/R and pretreated with OEA. (D–G)
  The expression levels of P85, P-Akt, and Bax, Bcl-2 in cells induced by high glucose
  and OGD/R and pretreated with OEA or LY294002. (H) DAPI fluorescent dye (nucleus,
  blue), TUNEL (green) apoptotic markers were used for immunofluorescence staining
  of cells in each group, scale = 100 μm. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, δδP <
  0.01 vs. HG group; ♦p < 0.05 vs. HG + OGD/R group; and &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p
  < 0.001 vs. HG + OGD/R + LY294002 group.
