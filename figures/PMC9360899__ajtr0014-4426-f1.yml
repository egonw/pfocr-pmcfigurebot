caption: Many RNAs, proteins, and drugs can directly or indirectly interact with the
  PI3K/AKT pathway, exerting their respective carcinogenic or anticancer effects.
  PTEN is a tumor suppressor and its inactivation can lead to carcinogenesis. UBR5,
  which is a key regulator of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, can inactivate PTEN
  by ubiquitination. In contrast, DMBT1 can directly bind with and stabilize PTEN
  to reverse the phosphorylation of AKT. Furthermore, LINC00152 can function as a
  cancer promotor by directly producing p-AKT and p-PI3K without changing the number
  of PI3K and AKT.
