caption: Assimilation of hydroxybenzenes and hydroxybenzoates. The cells were grown
  overnight in a complex liquid medium, washed with water and diluted to a concentration
  6 × 106 cells/ml. Serial 5-fold dilutions were spotted onto plates with synthetic
  media containing indicated carbon sources (see Materials and methods for details).
  The plates were incubated for 7 days at 28°C. The metabolic pathways involved in
  catabolism of corresponding substrates are indicated [i.e. the gentisate pathway
  and the catechol and hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ) branches of the 3-oxoadipate pathway
  (3-OAP)].

  uncovers Candida theae as a new hybrid lineage with pathogenic potential in the
  Candida parapsilosis species complex.
