caption: Effect of SPHK-1siRNA in chrysin-treated PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells were transfected
  with control or SPHK-1 siRNA for 48 h and were incubated in the presence or absence
  chrysin for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting to
  analyze the expression. (A) Representative Western blot images and relative densitometric
  bar graphs of SPHK-1, p-AKT, p-GSK-3β, and HIF-1α. VE-cadherin, and PCNA. Bar graphs
  represent the quantification of interest protein related to β-actin or total AKT
  and total GSK3β, presented as a fold change of control. a~e means in a row by different
  superscripts are significantly different by LSD (least significant difference) at
  p < 0.05. (B) Representative Western blot images and relative densitometric bar
  graphs of SPHK-1, HIF-1α, VE-cadherin, and PCNA. Data represent mean ± SD for three
  times. a~f means in a row by different superscripts are significantly different
  by LSD (least significant difference) at p < 0.05. (C) Hypoxic PC-3 cells were treated
  with chrysin and/or NAC. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression
  of SPHK-1, HIF-1α, p-AKT, AKT, p-GSK-3β, GSK-3β, and β-actin in hypoxic PC-3 cells.
  Bar graphs represent the quantification of interest protein related to β-actin or
  total AKT and total GSK3β, presented as a fold change of control. a~h means in a
  row by different superscripts are significantly different by LSD (least significant
  difference) at p < 0.05.
