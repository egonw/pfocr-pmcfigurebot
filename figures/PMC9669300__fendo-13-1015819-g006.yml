caption: Diagram of a possible mechanism by which SG improved DCD. In DM rats, inhibition
  of PI3K signaling resulted in histological changes in the hippocampus by promoting
  tau phosphorylation and inducing apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Activation of
  PI3K signaling pathway was associated with SG-induced amelioration of DCD.
