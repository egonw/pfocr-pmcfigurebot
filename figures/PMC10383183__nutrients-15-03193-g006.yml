caption: 'Effect of PBE on RANKL-induced PLCγ2, c-Fos, and NFATc1 expression. BMMs
  were cultured with RANKL (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL), with or without PBE (50
  μg/mL), for the indicated time periods. Western blotting was performed to analyze
  the protein expression levels of (A) PLCγ2, p-PLCγ2, (B) CREB, p-CREB, (C) c-Fos,
  and (D) NFATc1. Protein expression levels were quantified using ImageJ software,
  and values are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Bars labeled with different superscripts
  indicate # p < 0.05 vs. RANKL-non treated group; * p < 0.01 vs. control; ** p <
  0.005 vs. control; *** p < 0.001 vs. control.'
