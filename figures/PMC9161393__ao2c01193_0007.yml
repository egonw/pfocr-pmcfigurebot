caption: Biosynthetic pathway of formation of different fucosylation linkages by fucosyltransferase
  (FUT) enzymes through qPCR quantification. (a) qPCR quantification of FUT genes
  showed a substantial increase in FUT1 (2.17-fold), FUT3 (1.68), FUT4 (6.56), FUT6
  (8.49), FUT7 (7.93), and FUT9 (11.09). The mRNA is extracted from lung tissues of
  adjacent non-tumors (control) and tumors; (b) FUT8 enzyme transfers GDP-β-l-fucose
  to the innermost GlcNAc, forming core-fucosylation (1.16-fold). The α1,2 linked
  fucosylation is catalyzed by FUT2, and the α1,3 linked fucosylation is catalyzed
  by the combination of FUT4, FUT6, and FUT9 enzymes.
