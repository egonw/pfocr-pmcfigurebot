caption: 'HIBCH and 3-HIB are responsive to PDK4 inhibition. A: Graphical representation
  of Spearman correlations for hepatic PDK4 mRNA and different variables in 66 liver
  donors with different degrees of liver fat content and known NAFLD/NASH status ranging
  in BMI from 23 to 46 kg/m2 (Liver cohort). Correlations are significant for p < 0.05
  (indicated by black outline for the analysis without adjustment for multiple testing).
  B: Hepatic PDK4 mRNA expression in participants from the Liver cohort. Participants
  were stratified based on NAFLD/NASH status, BMI, T2D status and SAT and VAT adiposity.
  C–E: Huh7 liver cells were treated with and without free FAs (1:1 M ratio of 50 μM PA
  and 50 μM OA) combined with PDK4 inhibitor (final concentration of 6 or 12 μM PS10)
  (DMSO was used as control) for 24 h before analyses. C: HIBCH mRNA expression in
  Huh7 cells measured by qPCR, calculated relative to the reference gene HPRT (n = 6).
  D: Effect of PDK4 inhibitor on relative FA uptake in Huh7 cells treated with or
  without FA for 24 h, followed by addition of fluorescent dodecanoic acid whose uptake
  was detected spectrophotometrically after 1 h (n = 9–12). E: Average net medium
  appearance per hour of 3-HIB and valine in Huh7 cells during a 24 h period (n = 6)
  in response to PDK4 inhibitor. Clamp GIR, glucose infusion rate from euglycemic
  hyperinsulinemic clamp; FA, fatty acid treatment; FFA, free fatty acids; HDL-C,
  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; IL-6, interleukin-6; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol; SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; VAT, visceral adipose tissue; TAG,
  triacylglycerols.∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (Ordinary one-way ANOVA–Sidak''s
  test, unpaired t-test, Kruskal–Wallis—Dunn''s test or Mann–Whitney test).'
