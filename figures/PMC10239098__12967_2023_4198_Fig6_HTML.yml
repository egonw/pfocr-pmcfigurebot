caption: 'DPSC-Exos treatment alleviated SS-like symptoms in NOD/ltj mice. A Scheme
  of animal experiment and treatment. B The saliva flow rate, C H&E stained histological
  images of mice submandibular glands. Immunohistochemistry analysis of AQP5 (D, E)
  and GPER (F, G) expression in mice submandibular glands. H The anti-SSA/SSB levels
  of NOD/ltj mice serum were detected by ELISA. Western blot (I, J) and RT-qPCR analysis
  (K) of AQP5 expression in mice submandibular. Scale bar: 100 μm. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD, n = 6. Significant effect of the treatment, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001'
