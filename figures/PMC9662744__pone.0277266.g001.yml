caption: '(a-i): Hepatic expression of GHR, STAT5, and IGF-1 proteins in the study
  groups. GHR expression: a)in healthy control: b) in cirrhotic patients; c) in HCC
  patients; (predominantly cytoplasmic); STAT5 expression: d) in healthy control;
  e) in cirrhotic patients; f) in HCC patients (cytoplasmic/nuclear) IGF-1 expression:
  g)in healthy controls; h) in cirrhotic patients; i) in HCC patients (predominantly
  cytoplasmic). Magnification 200 X scale bar 100 Î¼m. HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma;
  GHR: growth hormone receptor; STAT5: signal transducer and activator of transcription5;
  IGF-1: insulin like growth factor-1.'
