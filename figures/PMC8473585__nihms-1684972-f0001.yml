caption: Genomic landscape of prostate tumors before treatment with neoadjuvant androgen
  deprivation therapy plus enzalutamide. (A) Genomic and clinical data per patient
  (n = 37). One patient classified clinically as a nonresponder underwent transurethral
  resection of prostate tumor instead of radical prostatectomy so RCB could not be
  calculated. BTB = baseline tumor burden (cm3); RCB = residual cancer burden (cm3);
  PGA = percent genome altered; SNVs = small nucleotide variants; PSA = prostate-specific
  antigen (ng/ml); BGG = highest biopsy Gleason group. (B) Distribution of RCB values
  across 15 exceptional responder (ER) and 21 incomplete and nonresponder (INR) cases
  with a cutpoint of 0.05 cm3. (C,D) Frequency and odds ratio for 27 genomic features
  for comparison of INR and ER (C) cases and (D) lesions. (E,F) Grouping of altered
  genes into eight pathways, with the proportion of affected (E) cases and (F) lesions
  with genes altered per pathway. For C–F, each factor was considered independently
  in a two-sided Fisher’s exact test, and the effect size is given as an odds ratio
  (OR). ORs >1 favor INR. For C–F, these are exploratory analyses that are underpowered
  for per-gene analyses, and thus may not be replicable in other cohorts when adjustments
  for multiple testing are applied.
