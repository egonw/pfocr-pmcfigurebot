caption: Establishment of in vitro system models based on tumor-derived organoids
  and culture enriched with cancer-associated fibroblasts (eCAFs) to validate the
  expression profile of ligand and receptor genes associated with the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway in ovarian cancer. Gene expression of CAFs ligands A and epithelial cells
  receptors (B) for these ligands. Genes were ordered based on a marker selection
  (signal to noise) that highlights the differences in the expression profile (normalized
  counts) of eCAFs A or normal tissues B compared to the other three conditions. C
  Top 50 highly variable genes from the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway across all samples.
  Genes were ordered based on a marker selection (signal to noise) that highlights
  the differences in the expression profile (normalized counts) between normal tissue
  and malignant cells. D Expression profile (normalized counts) of ligands and receptors
  of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway across all samples. Rows (for ligand or receptor
  genes) were ordered based on a marker selection (signal to noise) that highlights
  the differences in the expression profile (normalized counts) of normal tissues
  when compared to the other three conditions
