caption: (A,B) ASF1b mRNA levels of GC vs. normal adjacent tissues (NAT) in Oncomine
  database (Cho Gastric, DErrico Gastric ,P<0.0001). (C) GEPIA revealed ASF1b was
  significantly upregulated in 408 GC tissues. (D) ASF1b was significantly upregulated
  at most of tumors except Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML) and Testicular Germ Cell
  Tumors (TGCT) (E,F) The association between ASF1b expression and overall survival
  (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients assessed by K-M plotter, respectively.
  (G,H) The association between ASF1b expression and OS, DFS in GC patients assessed
  by ZJU cohort, respectively. (I) Multivariable and univariable analyses were performed
  in Zhejiang cohort. All the bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals.
article_title: ASF1b is a novel prognostic predictor associated with cell cycle signaling
  pathway in gastric cancer.
