caption: 'Evodiamine may inhibit DU145 cell migration through PI3K signaling pathway.
  (a) The migratory properties of DU145 cells were analyzed by wound-healing assays.
  Original magnification: 100x. (b) The relative wound width was analyzed using GraphPad
  Prism 7.0. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, #P < 0.05, and
  ##P < 0.01 versus the control group. (c) Venn diagram displays the overlap between
  the migration-related targets and the potential targets of evodiamine. (d) PPI network
  of 85 target genes of E&M. Each node represents the E&M targets. Each line represents
  the interaction between two targets. (e) The top 20 enriched targets in the PPI
  network were displayed in a barplot.'
