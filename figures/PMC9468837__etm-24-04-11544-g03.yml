caption: 'TREM1 knockdown inhibits ERS via blocking the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. (A) The
  expression levels of proteins associated with TLR4/NF-κB signaling were determined
  using western blotting. (B) The levels of ERS-associated proteins were detected
  using western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs.
  IL-1β + si-NC; ΔP<0.05, ΔΔΔP<0.001 vs. IL-1β + si-TREM1. TREM1, triggering receptor
  expressed on myeloid cells 1; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; si, short interfering; NC, negative control; p-, phosphorylated.'
article_title: Knockdown of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1)
  inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress and reduces extracellular matrix degradation
  and the apoptosis of human nucleus pulposus cells.
