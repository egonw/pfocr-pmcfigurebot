caption: Analysis of Calprotectin signaling pathways at cell type level from RA synovium
  scRNA-seq data. (A) SPRING representation of RA synovium scRNA-seq data () and the
  corresponding cell type labels assigned to each cell. (B) Bubble plot illustrating
  max-normalized average expressions of the calprotectin signaling pathway components
  including ligand subunits, S100A8 and S100A9, and the TLR4 receptor, per cell type
  (color of the circles), and fraction of cells expressing them within its corresponding
  cell type (size of the circles; adjusted by the total number of cells expressing
  the respective gene). (C) Left panel is the heatmap depicting all putative cell–cell
  communications of the S100A8|TLR4 + S100A9|TLR4 pathway (when both interactions
  are presented). The colormap shows the strength of interaction between the cell
  types. The middle and right panels show the chord diagram and graph representation
  of significant S100A8|TLR4 + S100A9|TLR4 interactions between different cell types
  identified by DiSiR, respectively.
