caption: 'Rab22a regulated the EMT process of thyroid cancer cells via PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of EMT-related
  proteins upon Rab22a transfection was changed after treatment with PI3K inhibitors
  (a, b). Statistical data were the mean ± SD of the three repeated independent trials:
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗P < 0.05.'
