caption: Overexpression of KLF10 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of melanoma
  cells. (A) Western blotting and (B) reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were
  used to detected the expression levels of KLF10. (C) A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay
  was used to detect the levels of cell proliferation. (D) A colony formation assay
  was used to detect the cell cloning levels. Scale bar, 250 µm. (E) Cell apoptosis
  was detected by TUNEL staining. Scale bar, 50 µm. (F) Expression levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3) were examined by western blotting. ***P<0.001
  vs. Ov-NC. KLF10, Kruppel-like factor 10; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression.
article_title: KLF10 upregulates ACSM3 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to inhibit
  the malignant progression of melanoma.
