caption: Mi‐ISC‐1 disrupts salicylic acid (SA) synthesis in host plants. (a) Mi‐ISC‐1
  affects the production of SA via the reconstitution of de novo SA biosynthesis in
  Nicotiana benthamiana. Quantification of SA in various co‐infiltrated N. benthamiana
  leaves at 4 days postinfiltration (dpi). The data shown were calculated from three
  independent biological replicates with similar results. Statistically significant
  differences using one‐way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's tests (p < 0.05)
  are indicated with different letters. (b) Proposed model of Mi‐ISC‐1 subverting
  plant SA biosynthesis to suppress plant immunity. Chorismate is converted to isochorismate
  in the plastid by isochorismate synthase (ICS) SID2, then the isochorismate is transported
  by EDS5 (earlier named SID1) to the cytosol, where the isochorismoyl‐glutamate synthase
  PBS3 catalyses the conjugation of l‐glutamate to isochorismate to produce isochorismate‐9‐glutamate,
  which is then converted to SA by EPS1 or spontaneous decay. Meloidogyne incognita
  secretes Mi‐ISC‐1 to compete with PBS3 to deplete the cytoplasmic isochorismate,
  thus disrupting SA biosynthesis via the ICS pathway
article_title: An unconventionally secreted effector from the root knot nematode Meloidogyne
  incognita, Mi‐ISC‐1, promotes parasitism by disrupting salicylic acid biosynthesis
  in host plants.
