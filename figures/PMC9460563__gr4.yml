caption: Controlling flux through the β-ketoadipate pathway. (A) p-CA is catabolized
  through the aromatic intermediates 4-HBA, PCA, and βKA, where PcaIJ converts βKA
  to β-ketoadipyl-CoA. βKA can be accumulated as product by deletion of pcaIJ, or
  further metabolized into a unit of succinate and acetyl-CoA which supports growth
  via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The overall reaction is p-CA + ATP + CoA
  + 2O2 + H2O -> βKA + acetyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate + CO2 + 2H+ (B) Growth rate
  of pcaIJ knockdown strain induced during early exponential phase grown in 20 mM
  p-CA as the sole carbon source. The growth rates of the non-targeting control strain,
  gNT and the uninduced knockdown strain gpcaIJ-2 were calculated at 9h of growth
  during early exponential phase. The pcaIJ knockdown strain was induced with 0.25 mM
  IPTG at 8h and the growth rate was measured at 9 and 16h of growth. (C) 50 mL cultures
  containing 40 mM p-CA were inoculated at OD600 = 0.1 and induced with 0.25 mM IPTG
  14 h later, red arrow. The concentration of p-CA, 4-HBA, PCA, and βKA, in the supernatant
  was plotted as a function of time alongside the OD600. Titer, T, was calculated
  at 36 h when p-CA dropped to zero (D) The product yield YP/S was plotted for the
  24 h and 36 h time point relative to the initial substrate concentration. A paired
  t-test between the 24 h and 36 h time points showed no significant difference (p=0.29).
  All error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
