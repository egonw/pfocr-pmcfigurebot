caption: The sample was detected by protein spectrum, and proteins (unused ≥ 1.3)
  were screened followed by calculation. (a) Peptides (95%), confidence ≥ 95%, and
  the number of repeated proteins were removed; spectra, the number of secondary mass
  spectrograms corresponding to the protein. (b) The related signal pathway was analysed
  by STRING analysis.
