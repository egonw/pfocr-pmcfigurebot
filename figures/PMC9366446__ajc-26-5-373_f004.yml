caption: Mir-615-3p inactivates the P13K/Akt pathway by inhibiting MEF2A. (A-B) H/R-stimulated
  HCMs were pretreated with NC mimics, miR-615-3p mimics, or cotreated with miR-615-3p
  mimics+MEF2A overexpression vector, and the protein levels of phosphorylated PI3K,
  Akt and total PI3K, Akt proteins were measured by Western blot analyses. *P < .01,
  ***P < .001. HCMs, human cardiomyocytes
