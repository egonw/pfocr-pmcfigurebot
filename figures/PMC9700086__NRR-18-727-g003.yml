caption: 'Pathways involving the neuroprotective effects of AGO (schematic).Through
  MT1/MT2, AGO can activate PI3K-AKT-GSK3β and MAPK-ERK1/2-RSK90-CREB cascades, which
  control gene transcription or protein modification. Activation of GSK3β inhibits
  tau phosphorylation. CREB can control BDNF transcription. By inhibiting the 5-HT2C
  receptor (5-HT2CR), AGO can also inhibit IP3 from releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum, and promote expression of BDNF which combined with TrkB and activate
  the MAPK-ERK1/2-RSK90-CREB signaling pathway. 5-HT2C: 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2C; AGO:
  agomelatine; AKT: protein kinase B; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CREB:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein; ERK: extracellular
  signal-related kinase; GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase 3β; IP3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; MT1: melatonin receptor 1A; MT2: melatonin
  receptor 1B; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; RSK90: 90 kDa ribosomal s6 kinase;
  TrkB: tropomyosin-related kinase B.'
