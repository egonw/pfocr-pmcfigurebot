caption: 'Central nervous system stimulation as part of the functioning of the gut–brain
  axis may occur through 3 afferent pathways: (1) production of endocrine or paracrine
  cytokines by lymphocytes in contact with the microbiota, (2) activation of neuron
  terminals by intestinal peptides secreted by enteroendocrine cells, and (3) exerting
  an endocrine or paracrine effect in intestinal epithelial cells by neurotransmitters
  or their precursors produced by the intestinal microbiota. After the activation
  of the central nervous system, the signal reaches the brain stem (e.g., the nucleus
  of the solitary strand), and it is then transferred to a separate neural network
  consisting of the amygdala and the cortex of the island, whose task is to integrate
  information from internal organs. In response to the signal, the activation of the
  hypothalamic–pituitary axis of the adrenal gland and the secretion of corticosteroids,
  as well as the stimulation of efferent neurons, may occur, resulting in the activation
  of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and/or the sympathetic nervous system,
  causing the release of classical neurotransmitters, according to [,,].'
