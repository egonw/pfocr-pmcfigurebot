caption: 'Specific knockdown ATX improved HFD-induced β cell dedifferentiation in
  Sirt3f/f;Cre/+ islets in mice. Sirt3f/f and Sirt3f/f;Cre/+ mice were injected with
  AAV-Atx-shRNA (for specific knocking down ATX in pancreatic β cells) or AAV-scramble
  respectively, followed by feeding with HFD for 6 weeks before sacrifice. A-F: Immunofluorescent
  staining of insulin and JNK/p38 MAPK pathway or β cell dedifferentiation markers
  in mouse pancreas (scale bar, 50 μm). Green, p-JNK (A), p-p38 MAPK (B), NKX6.1 (C),
  PDX1 (D), ALDH1A3 (E) and NGN3 (F); red, insulin; blue, DAPI. G: GSIS was measured
  in isolated primary islets from four groups of mice (n = 3 mice per group). H, I:
  Relative mRNA expression levels of β cell identity genes (including Foxo1, Nkx6.1
  and Pdx1), Ins2, progenitor cell markers (Aldh1a3, Ngn3, Sox9 and Oct4) and α cell
  enriched genes (such as Arx and Mafb) were assessed by RT-PCR in isolated primary
  islets from four groups of mice (n = 3 mice per group). Data are presented as Mean ± SD.
  ∗, P < 0.05; ∗∗, P < 0.01; ∗∗∗, P < 0.001 by One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post hoc test. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
