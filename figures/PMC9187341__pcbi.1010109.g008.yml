figure_title: Expression of PI3K and MAPK pathway proteins are mediated by miR-105
  and miR-767
caption: (A) A549 cells were treated with negative control miRNA (Control) or miR-105
  and miR-767 mimics (miR) for 24 hours, followed by 0.3 μM ZSTK474. Cells were collected
  at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after drug treatment. (B) Control and miR-treated A549
  cells were incubated with insulin for 2 hours and protein expression was measured.
  (C) Protein expression was quantified using three replicates per treatment condition.
  ANOVA was performed and the p-values of main effects of miRNA, ZSTK474, and insulin
  are reported. Data are normalized to Control and presented as mean ± SEM.
article_title: Genome-wide cross-cancer analysis illustrates the critical role of
  bimodal miRNA in patient survival and drug responses to PI3K inhibitors.
