caption: 'Effects of ZEN on permeability barrier function and intestinal integrity.
  (A) Effects of ZEN on AP activity in IPEC-J2 cells. (B) Effect of ZEN on FITC–dextran
  permeability in IPEC-J2 cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations of
  ZEN for 48 h. Data are expressed as means ± SD of three independent experiments.
  # p < 0.05, ### p < 0.001 ZEN (48 h) versus control.'
