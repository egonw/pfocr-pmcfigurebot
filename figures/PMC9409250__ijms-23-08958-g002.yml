caption: DEG enrichment analysis utilizing GO and KEGG pathways. (A) GO classifications
  of DEGs. (B) KEGG classifications of DEGs. The first circle from outside and inside
  is the pathway of the top 20 enrichment terms, and the number outside the circle
  is the gene number scale. The second circle represents the number and Q value of
  the pathway in the background gene. The third circle represents the number and ratio
  of up- (light purple) and down-regulated (dark purple) genes. The fourth circle
  represents the Rich Factor value of each pathway. GO:0043531, ADP binding. GO:0005976,
