caption: (A) Synaptic pruning in brain development serves to refine communication
  between functional areas by improving the signal-to-noise ratio. At early postnatal
  stage, Cajal-Retzius cells (C-R) that express 5-HT3A, respond to 5-HT by releasing
  reelin which, through the activation of the integrin signaling pathway, induces
  pruning of apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons (Pyr). (B) Pruning reduces unnecessary
  cross-talk with neighboring nodes (blue and red in typical development, Panel TD).
  However, in the presence of too many overlapping connections, distinct signals from
  neighboring communities may compete and interfere with each other, effectively creating
  noise and “confusion” within the network (blue and red in autism spectrum disorder,
  Panel ASD), while negatively affecting the development of long-distance connectivity,
  such as those between fronto-parietal regions for higher-order executive functions
