caption: NRSE mediated pathway in a normal individual and diseased patient. In normal
  individuals, transcription factor REST–NRSF binds to NRSEs in neuronal gene promoters
  such as in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. By interacting with
  REST-NRSF in the cytoplasm and lowering its availability in the nucleus to bind
  to NRSE sites, wild-type htt maintains BDNF synthesis, which is a crucial survival
  factor for the striatal neurons that die in HD. In these circumstances, activators
  can bind to the BDNF promoter regions and then recruit the general transcriptional
  machinery and Pol II, promoting the transcription of BDNF. While in HD, REST-NRSF
  levels in the nucleus rise as a result of mutant htt’s failure to connect with REST-NRSF
  in the cytoplasm. In these circumstances, REST-NRSF binds to the NRSE with vigor
  and stimulates the recruitment of Sin3A-histone-deacetylase complexes (HDACs), which
  contain histone deacetylase activity for remodeling chromatin into a closed architecture
  and squelching BDNF transcription. REST stands for repressor-element-1 transcription
  factor. NRSE stands for neuron-restrictive silencer element.
