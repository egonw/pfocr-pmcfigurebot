caption: Discovery of DNA repair and replication components enriched in non-pCR TNBC
  tumors. A, Cytobands enriched in genes differentially expressed between non-pCR
  and pCR for both mRNA and protein. To identify upregulated or downregulated features
  overrepresented in certain cytobands within the chromosome, GSEA was used to identify
  regions from chromosomal location databases enriched with differential genes [GSEA
  input was ranked expression list (signed −log10P value) from Wilcoxon rank sum tests].
  Overrepresented cytobands that were either enriched or depleted using differentially
  expressed mRNA and protein are indicated in B, and the overlapping sets were used
  for further analysis. B, Plot showing significantly enriched or depleted cytobands
  obtained by running differential mRNA and protein ranked lists through GSEA. NES,
  normalized enrichment score. Genes downregulated in non-pCR samples corresponding
  to cytoband 19q13.31–33 are indicated in C. C, Venn diagram showing differential
  (non-pCR vs. pCR) mRNA and proteins located on cytoband 19q13.3. D, Overrepresentation
  analysis (ORA) shows that differential 19q13.31–33 genes are enriched with Hallmark
  DNA repair pathway genes. Downregulation of these DNA repair genes at the mRNA and
  protein levels in non-pCR cases is shown in the bar chart on the right as signed
  −log10P values from Wilcoxon rank sum tests. E, Box plot comparing RNA expression
  of DNA repair genes located on 19q13.31–33 in the previously published BrighTNess
  clinical trial (treatment arms A and B), in which patients were treated with carboplatin
  and paclitaxel. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare residual disease
  (RD) cases with pCR cases. F, Forest plot showing hazard ratios (HR) and P values
  for metastasis-free survival associated with LIG1, POLD1, XRCC1, and ERCC2. HR is
  based on categorizing samples using a median expression cutoff for each gene in
  the Hatzis dataset.
