caption: Anti‐proliferation of human GIST cancer cell lines and patient‐derived primary
  cells after treating with nintedanib and imatinib within FGF‐2. (A) Effects of nintedanib,
  imatinib and sunitinib on proliferation of GIST‐T1 and GIST‐882 cell lines within
  20 ng·mL−1 FGF2 for 3 days using CellTiter‐Glo assay. Data are shown as mean ± SD
  (n = 3, independent experiments). (B) Effects of nintedanib and imatinib on the
  FGFR and KIT signalling pathways in GIST‐T1 and GIST‐882 cell lines within 20 ng·mL−1
  FGF2 for 4 h (immunoblotting; n = 3, independent experiments). (C) GIST‐T1 and GIST‐882
  cell lines were treated with imatinib for 4 h to activate FGF/FGFR signalling pathway,
  after which imatinib was removed and the cells were treated with nintedanib for
  4 h for immunoblotting analysis. This experiment was conducted once. (D) Effects
  of nintedanib and imatinib on the FGFR and KIT signalling pathways in three GIST
  patients within 20 ng·mL−1 FGF2 for 4 h (immunoblotting).
