caption: MSC-secreted TGF-β2 activates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in GIST cells.
  Both conditioned medium and recombinant TGF-β2 protein activate the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway of GIST, and the TGF-β2 monoclonal antibody antagonizes these effects (A,
  B). After silencing receptor II in the TGF-β receptor complex on the surface of
  GIST cells (C), both conditioned medium and recombinant TGF-β2 protein failed to
  activate the PI3K-AKT pathway of GIST (D, G). The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway inhibitor
  Wortmannin was able to antagonize the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  by conditioned medium and recombinant TGF-β2 protein (E, F). All experiments were
  repeated at least thrice. Data are means ± SEM (n = 3 in each group) *p < 0.05;
  **p < 0.01
