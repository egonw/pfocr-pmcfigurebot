caption: Effects of dietary glycerol monolaurate on cecal microbiota diversity of
  lipopolysaccharide-challenged broilers. Veen diagram (A); PCoA based on unweighted
  Unifrac distance (B); ANOSIM based on unweighted Unifrac distance (C). a-b Means
  with no common superscripts differ significantly (P < 0.05). Means are based on
  6 replicates per treatment with 1 bird per replicate. CON = control, birds fed a
  basal diet; GML = glycerol monolaurate, birds fed a basal diet containing 1,200 mg/kg
  GML; LPS = lipopolysaccharide, birds fed a basal diet and challenged with LPS; LPS + GML = birds
  fed a basal diet containing 1,200 mg/kg GML and challenged with LPS; ANOSIM = analysis
  of similarities.
article_title: Glycerol monolaurate attenuated immunological stress and intestinal
  mucosal injury by regulating the gut microbiota and activating AMPK/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway in lipopolysaccharide-challenged broilers.
