caption: (A) Western analysis of HFK, HFK-HPV31E6, HFK- HPV31E7, HFK- HPV31E6/E7 and
  HFK31 cells for factors in canonical cGAS pathway activity in response to digitonin
  permeabilization and treatment with 5μG/mL 2’3’cGAMP for 4hrs. (B) Time course examining
  cGAS protein levels in HFK-HPV31E7 cells following p53 knockdown at 1 to 3 days
  post p53 siRNA transfection.
