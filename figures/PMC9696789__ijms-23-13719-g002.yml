caption: 'Lactoferrin with different iron saturations (Apo-LF or Holo-LF) protects
  mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells and young mice from LPS-induced inflammatory
  injury. (A) The cell survival rate of the LPS-induced mouse primary intestinal epithelial
  cells treated with saline, Apo-LF and Holo-LF; (B) The expression levels of inflammatory
  factors in the mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells with different interventions;
  (C) The expression levels of inflammatory factors in the serum of the young mice
  with different interventions. n = 3 mice per group. Data represent mean ± SD. *
  p < 0.05 by Student’s t test and #p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA analysis.'
