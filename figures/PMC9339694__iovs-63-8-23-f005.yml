caption: 'Downstream APOA1 signaling involves the PI3K/AKT, p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways.
  (A–H) APOA1 treatment downregulated the p-PI3K (A, B), p-AKT (C, D), p-p38 (E, F)
  and p-NF-κB (G, H) expression significantly in the lymphocytes from DLNs of EAU
  mice, which were stimulated with IRBP1-20. BLT-1 partially reversed the effects
  of APOA1. (I–P) Lymphocytes from DLNs of EAU mice were obtained and stimulated with
  IRBP1-20 under different conditions: untreated (control), APOA1, APOA1 plus 740Y-P,
  APOA1 plus SC79, APOA1 plus DEH for 72 hours. Cells was measured with FCM on the
  gate of CD4+ T cells. APOA1 decreased the expression of IL-17A (I, J), IFN-γ (K,
  L) and TNF-α (M, N), but elevated Treg (O, P) compared with control. Whereas, the
  pathway agonists, 740Y-P, SC79 and DEH partially suppressed the APOA1-mediated effects
  (n = 5). The values represent the mean ± SD. nsp>0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.'
