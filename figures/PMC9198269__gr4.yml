caption: Correlation between genes related to resistance against the ERBB tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor lapatinib. A correlation matrix between drug screening results
  (AUDRC and IC50) and gene expressions using the GDSC1 dataset is shown. The chart
  includes only significant genes of the KEGG ERBB pathway for which the Spearman
  correlation coefficient (when compared to AUDRC) was ≤ -0.20 or ≥ 0.20.
