caption: 'Blockade of neuronal nuclear calcium/calmodulin pathway recapitulates the
  enhanced recruitment of microglia after trauma. A, B Buffering of CaM by CAMBP4
  significantly decreases neuronal pCREB intensity 3 h post-TBI (CT vs CaT; 2.33 ± 0.50
  vs 1.62 ± 0.29). N = 4. C No significant difference of neuronal density at the injury
  site 3 h post-TBI. Mean ± SD. N = 4. D–F Buffering of CamK activation does not significantly
  increase microglial pCREB intensity 3 h post-TBI. E CT vs CaT; 1.33 ± 0.41 vs 1.72 ± 0.62;
  N = 4) but significantly increased microglia density post-TBI F CT vs CaT; 4.58 ± 0.53
  vs 11.44 ± 2.66). Individual neurons are depicted as small datapoints; average per
  mouse (N = 4, used for statistics) depicted as red datapoints. Arrows indicate IBA1 + cells
  expressing pCREB. Data are shown as mean ± SD. Scale bar: 25 µm. N = 4. *p < 0.05;
