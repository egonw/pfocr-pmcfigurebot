caption: Induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest by Chloroxylon swietenia leaves
  methanol extract (CSLME) in MCF‐7 cells. MCF‐7 cells were incubated with either
  DMSO (vehicle control) or CSLME (20 μg/ml) and cell cycle distribution was analyzed
  using flowcytometry. (A) Histogram of cell cycle phase distribution of Control and
  CSLME (20 μg/ml) treated MCF‐7 cells. (B) Quantitative representation of cell cycle
  phases
