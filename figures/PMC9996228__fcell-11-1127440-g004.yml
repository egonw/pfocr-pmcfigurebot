caption: Meiotic response to asynapsis in female. Several mechanisms are proposed
  to be responsible for eliminating Spo11 −/−  oocytes. MSUC might trigger an unknown
  checkpoint signaling pathway in these oocytes or silence essential genes for development,
  leading to oocyte apoptosis. In parallel, in response to SPO11-independent DSBs,
  CHK2-mediated DNA damage signaling, which partially overlaps the recombination checkpoint
  pathway, also contributes to the elimination of Spo11 −/−  oocytes.
