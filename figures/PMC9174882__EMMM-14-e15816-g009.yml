figure_title: In vivo expansion of a novel transplantable disseminated lymphoma
caption: 'AA schematic showing the procedure by which a transplantable lymphoma line
  was passaged from a Cγ1‐Cre Blimp1 fl/fl mouse into C57bl/6 mice. Total splenocytes
  were inoculated intravenously (IV) and a lymphoma serially expanded in vivo. Each
  black dot represents a single mouse passage.BTime‐to‐welfare endpoint in C57bl/6J
  mice intravenously injected with a varying inoculum of splenocytes (Passage (P)
  5). The log‐rank test results per inoculum: 1 × 104 versus 2 × 105 cells = P = 0.008.
  5 × 104 versus 2 × 105 cells = P = 0.0179.C, D(C) Mass of lymphoma‐infiltrated versus
  tumor‐free C57bl/6J tissues (n = 6 biological replicates) and (D), gross morphology
  of spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) at welfare endpoint in representative
  mice. T‐test result was corrected for multiple comparisons by the Holm–Sidak method.
  Adjusted P < 0.000001 (spleen) and P = 0.000629 (liver). Error bars represent SEM.EH&E
  stain of infiltrated secondary lymphoid tissues with follicle structures (fo), red
  pulp (rp), and white pulp (wp) indicated in spleens.FImmunostain for CD21 in MLN
  labels B‐cells at a low staining intensity, and follicular dendritic cells (FDC)
  at a high staining intensity. IHC data in E and F are representative of 6 mice.
  Dotted lines represent the region magnified in the lower images. Dashed lines show
  the outline of the FDC network.GImmunostain for Ki67 in wildtype and lymphoma‐bearing
  spleen. Representative images are shown at left. The proportion of nuclei positive
  for Ki67 (proliferation index) is quantified at right for n = 3 spleens (T‐test
