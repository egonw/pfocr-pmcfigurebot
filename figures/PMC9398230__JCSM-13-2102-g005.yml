caption: Metabolic landscape of myonuclei from normal and denervated muscles. (A)
  Clustering on metabolic gene expression profiles of myonuclei enables identification
  of normal and denervation cell states. The dots are coloured according to different
  conditions (normal, blue; denervation, pink). (B) UMAP of metabolic profiles of
  different myonuclei subtypes in normal (right panel) and denervation (left panel).
  The dots are coloured according to corresponding subtypes. (C) Boxplot showing the
  metabolic activities of different myonuclei subtypes between normal and denervation.
  Each dot represents the activity score of an individual metabolic pathway. Comparisons
  between conditions are performed using Wilcoxon rank‐sum test. N, normal; D, denervation.
  (D) The activity score of top metabolic pathways detected in myonuclei subtypes.
  The blank indicates that the score of pathway activity is not significant in relevant
  subtype (random permutation test, P > 0.01). The metabolic pathways are arranged
  according to categories.
