caption: Effect of terrein on the activation of NF−κB and MAPK signaling pathway.
  RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of terrein for
  1 h before being incubated with LPS (200 ng/mL) for 1 h (for p65) or 10 min (for
  MAPKs). The phosphorylation of p65 (A) and MAPKs (B) was examined using Western
  immunoblot analysis.
