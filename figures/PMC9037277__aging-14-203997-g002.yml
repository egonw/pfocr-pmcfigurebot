caption: Enrichment analysis by GO and KEGG. (A, B) The enriched terms of up-regulated
  pathways. (C, D) The enriched terms of down-regulated pathways. (E) The KEGG pathway
  diagram showed the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and other pathways. (F–I) GSEA showed
  the enrichment of DEGs in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, HIF pathway and VEGF pathway.
  (J) KEGG online tool query showed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR was correlated with HIF and
  VEGF.
