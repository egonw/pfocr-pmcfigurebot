figure_title: PCDH1 activates the NF-κB pathway during PDAC progression by interacting
  with KPNB1
caption: A Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot assays showing exogenous
  PCDH1 and KPNB1 expression in Panc-1 cells. B Co-IP and Western blot assays showing
  endogenous PCDH1 and KPNB1 expression in Panc-1 cells. Western blot assay (C) and
  immunofluorescence assays (D) were performed to detect the effect of PCDH1 on the
  nuclear localization of p65 after KPNB1 silencing. MTT (D) and Transwell assays
  (E) were performed to detect the effects of PCDH1 expression on PDAC cell proliferation
  and migration after KPNB1 silencing. The results presented are the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments. The data were assessed by Student’s 2-tailed t test.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
