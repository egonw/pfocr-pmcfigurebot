caption: Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment
  of differentially expressed genes. (A) Biological process revealed extracellular
  structure organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization were enriched.
  (B) ECM-related cellular components were significant enriched. (C) Among molecular
  function, the receptor regulator activity, receptor ligand activity, ECM structural
  constituent, and ECM structural conferring tensile strength were enriched. KEGG
  enrichment analysis revealed the ECM-receptor interaction pathway was significant
  enriched in all 1831 DEmRNAs (D), 1114 upregulated DEmRNAs (E) and 717 downregulated
  DEmRNAs (F). (G) The ClueGO plug-in was used to investigate the interaction networks
  of enriched biological processes.
