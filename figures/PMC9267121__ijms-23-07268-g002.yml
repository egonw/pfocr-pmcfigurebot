caption: Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) improved the mRNA and protein expression levels of
  extracellular matrix synthesis (ECM)-relevant genes in the TNFα-treated human chondrocytes
  at 48 h. Effects of DHC on the mRNA expression levels of (A) aggrecan (Agg), type
  I/II collagen, and (B) degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1/13 (MMP1/13)
  and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, also known as Cox2) in the TNFα-treated
  human chondrocytes. (C) Protein expression levels of Agg, type II collagen, MMP13,
  and Cox2 in the TNFα-treated human chondrocytes detected through western blotting
  and (D–G) the quantitative results of the bands. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
  *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared to the TNFα group.
