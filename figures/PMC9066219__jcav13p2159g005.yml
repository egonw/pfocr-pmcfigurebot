caption: 'BLVRB depletion promoted cell migration by activating the Notch/Snail signaling
  pathway. A. The association of BLVRB with c-Notch and Snail in CCA tissues was assessed
  using IHC assays. Weak staining of BLVRB (red arrows) and positive staining of c-Notch
  and Snail (blue arrows) in CCA are shown in the right-hand column; positive staining
  of BLVRB (green arrows) and negative staining of c-Notch and Snail (yellow arrows)
  in matched peritumor tissue are shown in the left-hand column. Scale bar: 200 Âµm.
  B. Protein levels of c-Notch and Snail after BLVRB depletion. C. The effect of Ro4929097
  on RBE cell migration after BLVRB depletion. D. The effect of Ro4929097 on 9810
  cell migration after BLVRB depletion.'
