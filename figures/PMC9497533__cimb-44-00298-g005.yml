caption: Evodiamine inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, AKT, and mTOR in AGS and MKN45
  cells. Indicated doses of evodiamine (0, 1, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h were applied
  to (A) AGS and (B) MKN45 cells. A total of 10 μM evodiamine for the indicated time
  periods (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) were applied in (C) AGS and (D) MKN45 cells. The cell
  lysates were subjected to Western blot to evaluate the levels of FAK, p-FAK, AKT,
  p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR. β-actin was used as an internal control. EVD, evodiamine.
