caption: Wnt/β-catenin pathway is indispensable for Ly6D-mediated the expression of
  chemoresistance-related genes in LSCC. A. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed Ly6D-related
  pathways in LSCC tissue of TCGA database based on high expression group or low expression
  group of Ly6D. B. Volcano plot displayed that the differential genes between patients
  with high and low expression of Ly6D in LSCC. C. The mRNA levels of AXIN2, JAG1,
  LEF1, S100A7, and S100A8 of Tu686 cells with Ly6D overexpression or Ly6D silencing
  were determined by qPCR analysis. D. TOP/FOP flash reporter assay of LSCC cells
  with Ly6D overexpression or Ly6D silencing. The data were normalized to Renilla
  luciferase (internal control). E. Protein levels of β-catenin and active-β-catenin
  were detected by western blot in LSCC cells with Ly6D overexpression (left panel)
  or Ly6D silencing (right panel). F. Western blot analysis for the Tu686 cells with
  Ly6D knockdown were transient transfection of psin-flag-β-catenin plasmids (left
  panel). Then, the relative expression of indicated mRNAs was determined by qPCR
  analysis. G. The shcont or shLy6D cells were subjected to ChIP-qPCR analysis to
  determine the binding of β-catenin to the promoter regions of AXIN2, CCND1, and
  ABCB1. IgG was served as negative control.
