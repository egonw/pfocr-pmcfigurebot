figure_title: Lepr signaling orchestrates AM cellular metabolism to maintain a balanced
  energy status
caption: (A) OCR and ECAR of Lyz2-Cre and Leprfl/flLyz2-Cre AMs at resting state and
  after heat-inactivated Spn stimulation (MOI = 10) were measured by Seahorse XFe96
  Analyzer. Representative results from three independent experiments. A/R, antimycin
  A/rotenone. (B) Statistical analysis of maximal respiration and glycolytic capacity
  from (A). n = 3 to 6. (C) PCA of targeted metabolomics results of Lyz2-Cre and Leprfl/flLyz2-Cre
  AMs at resting state and after Spn stimulation for 4 hours. (D) Fold change (Leprfl/flLyz2-Cre
  versus Lyz2-Cre) of top five increased and decreased metabolites from metabolomics
  results after Spn stimulation for 4 hours. TCA cycle– and glycolysis-related metabolites
  were shown in red and blue, respectively. (E) Fold change (Leprfl/flLyz2-Cre versus
  Lyz2-Cre) of AMP and ratio of [AMP] × [ADP] to [ATP] from metabolomics results after
  Spn stimulation. “[]” indicated abundance of each adenine nucleotide. (F) Metabolic
  pathway map depicting alterations of metabolites at regulatory steps in glycolysis
  and TCA cycle from Lyz2-Cre and Leprfl/flLyz2-Cre AMs. Data are shown as means ±
  SEM. *P < 0.05 and ns, P > 0.05, paired t test.
