caption: Ly6D promotes β-catenin expression via suppression of miR-509-5p. (A) The
  mRNA levels of CTNNB1 in LSCC cells with Ly6D silencing or Ly6D overexpression was
  detected by qPCR analysis. (B) qPCR analysis was performed to determine the mRNA
  half-life time of CTNNB1 in LSCC cells with Ly6D silencing in the presence of actinomycin
  D (5 μg/ml) for 0 to 7 h. (C) Volcano plot showed the differential miRNAs which
  regulated by Ly6D in Tu686 cells with Ly6D silencing from the Scan Mir miRNA PCR
  array for CTNNB1. The fold changes > 2-fold change (log2) and P < 0.05 (-log10)
  were selected. The up-regulated miRNAs are marked red, and the down-regulated miRNAs
  are marked blue. (D) qPCR analysis was performed to determine the indicated miRNAs
  in CAL27 cells with Ly6D silencing. (E, F) Tu686 and CAL27 cells were transfected
  with miR-cont, miR-509-5p mimics, NC inhibitor, and miR-509-5p inhibitor for 48
  h, the expression of miR-509-5p (E) and CTNNB1 (F) were analyzed by qPCR analysis.
  (G) Tu686 cells were transfected with miR-cont, miR-509-5p mimic, NC inhibitor,
  and miR-509-5p inhibitor for 48 h, the expression of β-catenin was detected using
  western blot. (H) TOP/FOP flash plasmids were co-transfected into Tu686 cells with
  miR-509-5p mimic or inhibitor, and the luciferase activity was measured 48 h later.
