caption: 'Molecular mechanisms by which TSPO and its ligands inhibit chronic pain
  induced by peripheral nerve injury. (a, b) TSPO and its ligands inhibit microglia
  and astrocytes to secrete inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. These inflammatory
  factors can cause neuroinflammation leading to chronic pain. (c) TSPO and its ligands
  inhibit CXCL1-CXCR2-dependent astrocyte-to-neuron signaling and central sensitization.
  (d) TSPO and its ligands inhibit the expression of the p-ERK1/2 signaling pathway
  and its downstream BDNF in DRG. BDNF is synthesized in DRG causing chronic pain
  by regulating neurotransmitter production. TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β:
  interleukin-1β; IL-6: interleukin-6; CXCL1: chemokine CXC motif ligand 1; CXCR2:
  chemokine CXC motif receptor 2; p-ERK1/2: phospho-extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DRG: dorsal root ganglion.'
