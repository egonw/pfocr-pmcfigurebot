caption: A) GTKM profiles of three datasets, including TCGA, CGGA, and IvyGAP, for
  each cancer subtype in TCGA-GBM and CGGA datasets. B) The network-based pathway
  enrichment analysis, including gene ontology (GO) for biological processes, cellular
  components, and molecular functions for the gene list in the upregulated and downregulated
  areas in Mesenchymal and Proneural GTKM profiles, respectively. C) The network-based
  pathway enrichment analysis, including gene ontology (GO) for biological processes,
  cellular components, and molecular functions for the gene list in the downregulated
  and upregulated areas in Mesenchymal and Proneural GTKM profiles.
