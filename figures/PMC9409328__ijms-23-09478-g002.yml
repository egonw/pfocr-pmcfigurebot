caption: Differentiated HMGECs increased expression of beta 2-adrenergic receptor
  (ADRB2) (A) HMGECs were cultured with differentiation media from Day 0. mRNA (A)
  and protein expression (B) were measured by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting
  at day 0, 2, and 4, respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error
  of the mean. D, day after differentiation; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
