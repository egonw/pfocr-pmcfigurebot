caption: C-PC inhibited MSCs senescence by downregulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (A)
  Transcriptome sequencing analysis. A heat map of differentially expressed genes
  in senescent and C-PC treated MSCs. (B) GO enrichment analysis to show the enriched
  biological processes of differentially expressed genes. (C) KEGG pathway analysis
  to show the signaling pathway which differentially expressed genes were enriched
  in. (D) The protein levels of p-PI3K by Western blot and the quantification analysis.
  Protein levels were normalized to β-actin. (E) Representative images of β-Galactosidase
  Staining and the quantification analysis by Image J software. Scale bars, 50μm.
  (F) SOD activity assay of MSCs in different groups. (G) Western blot and the quantification
  analysis of senescence, autophagy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway related proteins. β-actin
  was used as the internal control. (H) Representative images of the observed autophagosomes
  by transmission electron microscope. One red arrow pointed to autophagosomes while
  two arrows pointed to autolysosome. Scale bars were shown in figure. (I) Western
  blot analysis of the protein levels involved in autophagy and mTOR signaling after
  autophagy block by Baf-A1 (200 nM, 6 h)in MSCs of different groups. β-actin was
  used as the loading control. Results were expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). The
  P values were determined by Kruskal-Wallis test.
