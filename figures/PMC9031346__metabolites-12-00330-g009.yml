caption: Putative roles of PLs and GS in kidney disease. Schematic illustration of
  the mechanisms of PLs and GS in renal inflammation. SPIEE contains PLs and GS. PLs
  suppress IL-1β expression by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway in Mφ and suppress MCP-1
  expression in Mφ, and GS suppresses MCP-1 expression in renal tubules and Mφ. Suppression
  of the renal inflammatory cycle through these actions is considered to contribute
  to the slowing down of nephropathy progression.
