caption: Exogenous hypochlorous acid partially reversed the CPP-inhibited activity
  of PHD2 and the CPP-increased protein level of HIF1a. (a–c) HOCl activates PHD2.
  PHD2 activity was examined using a PHD2 enzyme-linked immunoassay kit in HDFs treated
  with HOCl (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 50 μM) for 6, 12 or 24 h, respectively. (d–i)
  HDFs were pretreated with HOCl (50 μM) for 6 or 12 h, and then were treated with
  CPP (10 μM) for 48 h, after which PHD2 activity was examined using a PHD2 enzyme-linked
  immunoassay kit. (j–q) Protein levels of HIF-1α were examined by Western blot. Data
  are presented as means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, n = 3.
