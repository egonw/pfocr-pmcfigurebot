caption: Tentative metabolism pathway for poly(urethane) (PU) derived from esters.
  PU is enzymatically hydrolyzed by extracellular enzyme, PU esterase to polyisocyanate
  and ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolaldehyde and subsequently
  to glycolic acid. Glycolic acid is converted to pyruvic acid via glycolysis. Pyruvate
  dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA, which is later
  metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy, thereby
  releasing CO2 and water. Adapted from [].
