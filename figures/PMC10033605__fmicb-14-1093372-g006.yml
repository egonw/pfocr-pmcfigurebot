caption: (A,B) Metabolic genes and pathways of interest, annotated in each bin using
  KEGGDecoder and HMMER. Percentage completion of each pathway is indicated in shades
  of green. Z-scores of bin abundance within each well and across all wells are indicated
  in a blue/red heatmap at the top of the figure (negative z-scores in blue, positive
  z-scores in red).
