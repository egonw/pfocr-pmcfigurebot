caption: 'Related metabolic enzymes in PE de novo synthesis pathway in L02 cells were
  significantly changed by high glucose and free fatty acids stimulation. A: qRT-PCR
  was used to detect mRNA levels of PCYT2 and PISD in L02 cells (n = 3). B: Western
  blotting was used to detect protein levels of PCYT2 and PISD in L02 cells (n = 3).
  All experiments were repeated three times. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. PCYT2, phosphoethanolamine
  cytidylytransferase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PISD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR.'
