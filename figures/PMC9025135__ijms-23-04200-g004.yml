caption: Slc38a9 Deficiency induces apoptosis and alters multiple metabolic pathways.
  (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes. The X-axis indicates gene ratio, the size of dots represents the
  number of genes in the pathway, and the color indicates the size of the qValue.
  (B) Heatmaps of transcripts in apoptosis enrichment. (C) Heatmaps of transcripts
  in p53 signaling pathway enrichment. (D) Larvae were stained with AO to visualize
  apoptotic cells identified as green punctate dots. Scale bar = 500μm. (E) Annexin/PI
  apoptosis analysis in WT and slc38a9 mutant zebrafish embryos (3 dpf). (F) The percentage
  of late apoptosis cells in WT and slc38a9 mutant zebrafish embryos. Data shown are
  mean ± SEM, n = 3. ** p < 0.01.
