figure_title: Hyperphosphorylation of NS5A mediates protein interplay between NS5A
  and IKKε and is involved in the IFN-β signaling pathway
caption: (A) (Top) A schematic illustration of hyperphosphorylation mutation sites
  (S2194A, S2197A, S2201A, and S2204A) in NS5A. (Bottom) HEK293T cells were cotransfected
  with Flag-tagged IKKε and a wild-type or a hyperphosphorylation-defective mutant
  of NS5A expression plasmid. At 48 h after transfection, total cell lysates were
  immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and bound proteins were immunoblotted
  with an anti-NS5A antibody. Both immunoprecipitation efficiency and protein expression
  were verified by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies. (B) HEK293T
  cells were cotransfected with IFN-β reporter plasmid and Flag-tagged IKKε, Myc-tagged
  DDX3, pcDNA3-wild-type NS5A, and pcDNA3-hyperphosphorylation-defective mutant of
  NS5A expression plasmid as indicated. At 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity
  was measured and normalized against β-galactosidase. (C) HEK293T cells were cotransfected
  with Flag-tagged IKKε, Myc-tagged DDX3, pcDNA3-wild-type NS5A, and a pcDNA3-hyperphosphorylation-defective
  mutant of NS5A expression plasmid. At 48 h after transfection, total cell lysates
  were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and bound proteins were immunoblotted
  with an anti-Myc antibody. Both immunoprecipitation efficiency and protein expression
  were detected by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies. (D) HEK293T
  cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged IKKε, Myc-tagged DDX3, pcDNA3-wild-type
  NS5A, and a pcDNA3-hyperphosphorylation-defective mutant of NS5A expression plasmid.
  At 36 h after transfection, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated
  antibodies. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
