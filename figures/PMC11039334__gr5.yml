caption: 'RGD-NP promote the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  (CTLs)(A‒E) Flow cytometry results of tumors harvested to analyze tumor-infiltrating
  leukocytes with different treatments.(F and G) Tumors and lymph nodes were lysed
  to obtain protein samples. Relative amounts of p-TBK1, total TBK1, and GAPDH were
  measured via western blot.(H) Immunohistochemical staining of CD8+ T cells in CT26
  tumors. Scale bar, 50 μm Data are represented as mean ± SEM. (ns: p > 0.05, ∗: p < 0.05,
