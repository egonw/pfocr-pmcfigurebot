caption: Effect of jasmonate elicitation on alkaloid accumulation in the C1 and C4
  cell strains. a,b Time course of catharanthine accumulation in response to elicitation
  with JA (100 μM, a) or MeJA (100 μM, b) in strains C1 and C4 under conditions of
  auxin depletion (no 2,4-D). Solvent control in b consisted 0.04% EtOH. Data show
  mean ± SE from 3 independent experimental series. N.D. means that catharanthine
  was not detectable. c Representative HPLC–DAD-ESI–MS/MS chromatograms of extracts
  from auxin-depleted, JA-elicited C4 cells; m/z 337 (catharanthine and tabersonine),
  m/z 457 (vindoline), m/z 811 (vinblastine), m/z 825 (vincristine). d Representative
  gels showing amplicons from RT-PCR for genes representing the vindoline biosynthesis
  pathway. Time courses of expression were measured for both strains in response either
  to the solvent (0.04% EtOH) as a mock control, or to 100 μM MeJA as elicitor. t16h1
  (tabersonine 16-hydrolxylase 1), t16h2 (tabersonine 16-hydrolxylase 2), d4h (deacetoxyvindoline
  4-hydroxylase), dat (deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase), and exp (expressed
  protein) served as a reference housekeeping gene
