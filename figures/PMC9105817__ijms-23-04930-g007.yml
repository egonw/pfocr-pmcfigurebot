caption: 'EGR1 is required for the regulation of Pol-III-directed transcription mediated
  by FLNA: (A,B) FLNA and EGR1 expression was determined by RT-qPCR (A) and Western
  blot (B) using 293T cell lines expressing both FLNA shRNA and EGR1 shRNA or FLNA
  shRNA only and the control cell line. F/G and E/G, respectively, represent the ratio
  of FLNA (F), and EGR1 (E) intensities to the GAPDH (G) intensity (n = 3); (C) EGR1
  downregulation inhibited the activation of Pol-III-directed transcription caused
  by FLNA depletion in 293T cells. Expression of Pol III products was monitored by
  RT-qPCR using the cell line established in (A); (D,E) EGR1 downregulation inhibited
  the enhancement of cell proliferation caused by FLNA silencing. Cell proliferation
  activity was measured by cell counting (D) and MTT assays (E); (F) a pathway by
  which FLNA and EGR1 regulate Pol-III-directed transcription was proposed based on
  the data obtained in this study. Each column in the point–line and bar graphs represents
  the mean ± SD of three biological replicates (n = 3). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.
  p values for (A) were obtained by Student’s t-test by comparing two groups as indicated;
  p values for (D,E) were obtained by two-way ANOVA; p values for (C) were obtained
  by one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni test, with a comparison of two groups among
  multiple groups.'
