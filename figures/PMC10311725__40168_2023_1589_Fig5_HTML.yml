caption: 'FMT from healthy volunteers ameliorated the neurotransmitter perturbation
  by the Trp-Kyn pathway by affecting the rate-limiting enzymes in both the brain
  and colon. A Levels of Trp-Kyn metabolic pathway-derived neurotransmitters in the
  mice PFCs. B Levels of Trp-Kyn metabolic pathway-derived neurotransmitters in the
  mice colons. C Protein expression of the rate-limiting enzymes of the Trp-Kyn Pathway
  in the mice PFCs and colons. D Statistical plots of the mice PFCs. E Statistical
  plots of the mice colons. Data were displayed as mean ± SEM. Significant differences
  were determined via one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison procedure. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01 vs. the CTR group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. the CRS group;
  &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001 vs. the CRS + HC-tr group'
