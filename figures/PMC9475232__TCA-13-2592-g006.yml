caption: Downregulation of fibulin‐4 inhibits autophagy by activating the AKT–mTOR
  signaling pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. (a, b) The
  effects of fibulin‐4 silencing on AKT and mTOR phosphorylation in Eca109 cells were
  detected by western blot. The phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR were compared
  with the overall levels. (c, d) Triciribine (AKT inhibitor) was added to fibulin‐4‐silenced
  Eca109 cells. Western blot was used to detect AKT, mTOR and markers of autophagy.
  The phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR were compared with the overall levels.
  Quantitative analysis of autophagy‐related protein expression with normalization
  to GAPDH. The data are presented as the means ± SD of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
