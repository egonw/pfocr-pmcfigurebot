caption: 'Effects of brusatol, k252a, and U0126 on MCG-mediated pharmacological activity
  against ChAT activity (A) and ChAT expression (B) and effect of k252a on MCG-mediated
  pharmacological activity against ERK phsphorylation in the hippocampus of aged GPx-1
  KO mice. Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M. of 5 animals (ChAT activity) and
  3 animals (ChAT and ERK expressions). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. Saline / WT. #P < 0.05
  vs. Saline / GPx-1 KO. §P < 0.05 vs. MCG / GPx-1 KO. One-way ANOVA followed by Fisher''s
  LSD pairwise comparisons was used to analyze the data.'
