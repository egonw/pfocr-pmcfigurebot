caption: 'Identification and expression analysis of differentially expressed genes.
  (A): Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes. (B): Histogram of differentially
  expressed genes. (C): KO enrichment circular plot of differentially expressed genes.
  The top 20 pathways were enriched in the first circle with the coordinate ruler
  of the number of genes noted outside the circle. Different colors represent different
  classes. The number of pathways and the Q value in the background are reported in
  the second circle. The more genes, the longer the bar, the smaller the Q value,
  and the redder the color. A bar graph showing the ratio of upregulated and downregulated
  genes is shown in the third circle, in which dark and light purple represent the
  ratio of upregulated genes and downregulated genes, respectively. The RichFactor
  value of each pathway is shown in the fourth circle (the number of differentially
  expressed genes in the pathway divided by all the numbers).'
