caption: The mechanism of TLS formation.The primary pathway for TLSs formation involves
  stromal cells secreting CXCL13 and IL-7 to recruit LTi cells into the tumor tissue.
  The interaction between the LTa1β2 ligand on LTi cell surfaces and the LTβ receptor
  induces the formation of HEV. Immunocytes within HEV and some lymphocytes in SLO,
  under prolonged stimulation by inflammatory factors, disseminate into the tumor
  tissue, giving rise to the initial morphology of TLSs.
