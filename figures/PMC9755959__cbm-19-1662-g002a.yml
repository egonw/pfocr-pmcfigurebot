caption: MiR-378a-3p is underexpressed in GC and downregulates the expression of RAB31.
  (A) Venn diagram of RAB31-targeted miRNAs, predicted by bioinformatic analysis.
  (B, C) RAB31 mRNA expression after transfection with 3 different candidate miRNA
  mimics, inhibitor, and negative control (NC) in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. (D,
  E) Protein expression of RAB31 in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells after transfection
  with 3 different candidate miRNA mimics, inhibitor, and NC. (F) Relative miR-378a-3p
  expression in 7 GC cell lines and GES-1 cells. (G, H) Relative miR-378a-3p expression
  in 30 paired tissues from patients with GC. (I) Correlation between miR-378a-3p
  and RAB31 mRNA expression in 30 GC tissues. (J, K) Relative expression of miR-378a-3p
  in GC and normal tissues, on the basis of the GSE26595 and GES28700 datasets from
  the GEO database. (L) Relative expression of miR-378a-3p in GC and normal tissues
  in TCGA. (M) Relative expression of miR-378a-3p in 41 paired GC and adjacent normal
  tissues in TCGA. (N) Correlation between miR-378a-3p and RAB31 mRNA expression in
  GC tissues in TCGA (n = 372) (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns = no significance).
