caption: This is a figure. Schemes follow the same formatting. Moxibustion improved
  the expression of occludin, ZO-1 and proinflammatory cytokines in 5-Fu-induced IM
  rats. (A) Representative Western blot images showing the protein expression of occludin,
  ZO-1 and GAPDH (loading control). A quantitative analysis indicated that moxibustion
  induced recovery of the 5-Fu-mediated reduction in occludin and ZO-1 expression
  in the ileum, and a moxibustion dose of 15 min/day was more effective in restoring
  mucosal injury caused by 5-Fu. The bars represent the means ± SEMs (n = 4 per group).
  aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs the 5-Fu
  group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the Moxibustion-15 min/day group; hP < 0.01 vs
  the Moxibustion-30 min/day group. (B) Moxibustion intervention reduced the 5-Fu-induced
  expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in serum. The serum expression of TNF-α, IL-6
  and IL-1β was evaluated by ELISA. The bars represent the means ± SEMs (n = 6 per
  group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP < 0.01 vs
  the 5-Fu group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.05 vs the 5-Fu+Moxibustion-15 min/day group.
