caption: Expression levels of RNA silencing genes in Lee74 plants in response to SMV‐G7H
  expressing ATPsyn‐α and PSaC genes. Relative expression of Dicer‐like (DCL) 2a (a)
  and DCL4a (b), and of RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) 1a (c), RDR2a (d), and
  RDR6a (e) in Lee74 plants. Actin11 was used as the internal control. Values are
  means + SD of three biological replicates. Statistical analysis was carried out
  as described in Figure ; * and ** indicate a significant difference at p < 0.05
  and p < 0.01, respectively. An additional t test was carried out to compare expression
  in the pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::ATPsyn‐α and pSMV‐G7H::eGFP::PSaC treatment with that in
  the pSMV‐G7H::e GFP treatment
