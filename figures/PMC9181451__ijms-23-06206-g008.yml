caption: (A) Chemical structure of the GBD-9 compound; (B) cartoon models for the
  GBD-9 ligand part to find two distinct neosubstrate proteins (BTK, GSPT1) for polyubiquitination
  by E3 ligases. Then, the polyubiquitinated proteins would be degraded through the
  ubiquitination proteasome pathway.
