figure_title: HOXB9 regulates resistance to chemotherapy and stem cell population
caption: HOXB9-knockdown in Panc1 and MIApaCa2 cell lines elevated the sensitivity
  of these cells to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment; the HOXB9 knockdown
  effect was rescued by TGFβ1 recombinant (A, B). An asterisk marking is added to
  the values that are statistically significantly different from siGFP. The IC50 values
  of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel were significantly reduced in HOXB9-knocked down
  Panc1 and MIAPaCa2 cells (right panel of A and B). As shown in (C, left panel),
  CD44 was highly expressed in all cells, however, the expressions of CD24 and ESA
  were reduced upon HOXB9 knockdown; these were restored to control levels upon TGFβ1
  recombinant treatment. As shown in (C, right panel), CD44 was highly expressed in
  all cells, however, the expressions of CD133 and EpCAM were reduced upon HOXB9 knockdown;
  these returned to control levels upon TGFβ1 recombinant treatment.
