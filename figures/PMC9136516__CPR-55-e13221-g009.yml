caption: FGF6 promotes NRCMs cell cycle re‐entry in vitro. (A) Representative immunofluorescence
  (green for Ki‐67, red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) analysis the number of Ki‐67 positive
  NRCMs in different group. n = 5 per group. (B) Representative immunofluorescence
  (green for EdU, red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) analysis the number of EdU positive
  NRCMs in different group. Scale bar = 40 μm. n = 6 per group. (C) Representative
  immunofluorescence (red for cTNT, blue for DAPI) and quantitative analysis the number
  of binucleated NRCMs in different group. Scale bar = 40 μm. n = 4 per group. (D)
  Quantitative analysis the number of Ki‐67 positive NRCMs in (A), the number of EdU
  positive NRCMs in (B) and the number of binucleated NRCMs in (C). (E) Western blot
  was performed to determine the protein levels of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1 and PCNA in
  NRCMs. n = 5 per group. (F) Quantitative analysis the expressions of Cyclin D1,
  Cyclin E1 and PCNA in (E). Data represent means ± SEM. Two‐tailed Student's t test.
