caption: 'Knockdown (KD) of miR-126 induced apoptosis of A549 and H1650 cells. (a)
  Two miR-126 vectors (#1 and #2) significantly increased expression of the caspase
  3 in A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, n = 4); (b) both miR-126 vectors significantly increased
  expression of the caspase 9 in A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, n = 4); (c) two miR-126 vectors
  significantly decreased growth of A549 cells (∗∗∗P < 0.001); (d) both miR-126 vectors
  significantly increased expression of the caspase 3 in H1650 cells (∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (e) both miR-126 vectors significantly increased expression
  of the caspase 9 in H1650 cells (∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (f) two miR-126 vectors significantly
  decreased growth of H1650 cells (∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 6).'
