figure_title: Differential expressed proteins were characterized from CAF-CM and NOF-CM
caption: A Mass spectrum analysis of significant differential proteins in the supernatant
  of CAFs and NOFs. B Volcano plot depicted 95 differential proteins which were abundant
  in CAFs (red spots, log2 ratio > 2, P < 0.05). The bule spots represented the down-regulated
  proteins. C The top 20 significantly differentiated proteins were listed in the
  heatmap. CRMP2 (DPYL2, DPYSL2) was marked with a red square frame. D ELISA assay
  detected the expression of CRMP2 in the supernatant of CAFs and NOFs. E Western
  blotting analyzed the expression of CRMP2 in CAFs, NOFs, SKOV3, and A2780 cells.
  Results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001.
