caption: Expression patterns of 43 DEGs involved in PA biosynthesis and insolubilization.
  PA biosynthesis pathways include the chorismic acid pathway, phenylpropane pathway,
  flavonoid synthesis and proanthocyanidin-specific pathway. PA insolubilization refers
  to converting soluble PA into insoluble PA with acetaldehyde metabolism. Heatmaps
  depict the normalized gene expression values, which represent the mean value of
  three biological replicates.
article_title: Transcriptomic profiling analysis to identify genes associated with
  PA biosynthesis and insolubilization in the late stage of fruit development in C-PCNA
  persimmon.
