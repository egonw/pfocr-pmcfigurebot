caption: IFNγ induces NAMPT expression and IFNγ-induced increases in OCR are NAMPT-dependent.
  (A) Metabolic pathway analysis determined by the ERGO™ analysis platform based on
  differential gene expression from RNA-Seq data shown in panel B. (B) RNA sequencing
  of human monocyte–derived macrophages stimulated with IFNγ for 24 hours. (C) Diagram
  representing both NAM/NAMPT and nicotinamide ribose (NR)/NRK2-dependent NAD+ salvage
  pathways. (D) OCR measured by Seahorse in primary human monocytes treated with media
  alone or IFNγ with or without NAMPT inhibitor, FK866 (5 nM), for 24 hours prior
  to the start of the assay (n = 5 technical replicates). Data in panel D are from
  a representative tracing from 3 independent experiments. (E) Basal and PMA-stimulated
  OCR values from 3 independent experiments are summarized following normalization
  to the basal OCR values from samples without IFNγ, FK866, or PMA treatment. Data
  in panel E were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
  Error bars are mean ± standard error of the mean. **P < .01, ***P < .001, ****P
  < .0001.
