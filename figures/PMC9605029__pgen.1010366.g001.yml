figure_title: Overexpression of METTL14 prohibits BCa cell migration, invasion in
  vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo
caption: 'A. RT-qPCR was applied to measure the relative expression of METTL14 in
  human normal uroepithelium cell line (SV-HUC-1) and BCa cell lines (T24, 5637, J82
  and SW780). (n = 3) Each bar represents mean (or average); error bars represent
  SD. P values were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. B. RT-qPCR
  was implemented to measure the relative expression of METTL14 in BCa cells after
  the transfection of empty pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-METTL14 to verify the overexpression
  efficiency of pcDNA3.1-METTL14 (left panel). (n = 3) Each bar represents mean; error
  bars represent SD. P values were determined by Student’s t test. Western blot was
  used to examine the protein level of METTL14 in METTL14-overexpressing cells (right
  panels). C-D. Transwell (migration) and wound healing assays were conducted to determine
  the migratory ability of BCa cells before and after the overexpression of METTL14.
  (n = 3) Each bar represents mean; error bars represent SD. P values were determined
  by Student’s t test. E. Western blot analysis of the expression of migration markers
  (MMP2 and MMP9) in BCa cells before and after the overexpression of METTL14. F.
  Transwell (invasion) assay was performed to detect the invasive ability of BCa cells
  before and after the overexpression of METTL14. (n = 3) Each bar represents mean;
  error bars represent SD. P values were determined by Student’s t test. G. IF analysis
  was applied to detect the levels of EMT-related proteins: E-cadherin (an epithelial
  marker) and N-cadherin (a mesenchymal marker). H. Western blot analysis of the expression
  of EMT markers and transcriptional factors (Snail, Slug and ZEB1) in BCa cells before
  and after the overexpression of METTL14. I. Western blot analysis of the expression
  of PI3K pathway related proteins in BCa cells before and after the overexpression
  of METTL14. J. Representative images of IHC staining of METTL14 in the xenografts.
  K. Representative images and quantification results of H&E staining of metastatic
  nodules in the livers and lungs from the mice injected with METTL14-expressing or
  vector-transfected T24 cells. (n = 3) Each bar represents mean; error bars represent
  SD. P values were determined by Student’s t test. **P < 0.01. See also  and  Data
  files.'
