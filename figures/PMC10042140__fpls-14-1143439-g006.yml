caption: KEGG enrichment of differential metabolites between the comparison groups,
  Y-R vs Q-R, Y-RP vs Q-RP, Y-RS vs Q-RS, Q-R vs Q-RP, Q-R vs Q-RS, Q-RP vs Q-RS,
  Y-R vs Y-RP, Y-R vs Y-RS, and Y-RP vs Y-RS (A–I). Each bubble in the plot represents
  a metabolic pathway whose abscissa and bubble size jointly indicate the magnitude
  of the impact factors of the pathway. A larger bubble size indicates a larger impact
  factor. The bubble colors represent the p-values of the enrichment analysis, with
  darker colors showing a higher degree of enrichment. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
  of this article).
