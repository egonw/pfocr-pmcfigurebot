figure_title: Pathway enrichment analyses using the robustly identified proteins
caption: 'A) Pathway enrichment analyses of proteins identified on the meta-analyses
  identified 16 different pathways. Size in the dot chart corresponds to the number
  of identified proteins and color corresponds to the FDR corrected significance.
  Several differentially abundant proteins (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-1Ra, and STAT1, among
  others) for the thre outcomes were enriched in COVID-19 related pathways. Proteins
  were significantly enriched for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathway (FDR=6.84×10−22
  for COVID-19 infection; FDR=1.19×10−14 for ventilation; FDR=5.46×10−10 for death).
  Enrichment of COVID-19 infection (FDR=0.046) and ventilation (FDR=0.019) was observed
  for coronary artery disease.B) Forest plots of AD-related proteins: amyloid precursor
  protein (APP), Neurofilament light polypeptide (NFL), Neurogranin (NEUG), Ephrin
  type-A receptor 5 (EPHA5), Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase, mitochondrial
  (BCAT2), Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B), Microtubule-associated protein tau
  (MAPT*), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP*). *: showed a nominal significance
  (P<0.05).C) Forest plots of cardiovascular-related proteins: Troponin T (cardiac
  muscle), Angiopoietin-related protein 4 (ANGL4), FURIN, Sodium/potassium-transporting
  ATPase subunit beta-1 (AT1B1) and Transforming growth factor b1 (TGFB1).D) Tissue
  specificity enrichment analyses via FUMA for 30 tissues in GTEx v8 using the robustly
  identified proteins. In addition to enrichment for lung, we found enrichment for
  brain (P=2.03×10−19, 4.79×10−13, and 6.3×10−3 for COVID-19 infection, ventilation
  and death, respectively) and enrichment for heart (P=2.81×10−8, 6.02×10−8, and 3.03×10−3
  for COVID-19 infection, ventilation and death, respectively).'
