caption: SGOL2 knockdown inhibited HCC growth and metastasis in vivo. A-B Xenograft
  model was set up to study the effects of SGOL2 on HCC tumor growth in vivo. Mice
  were divided into two groups and inoculated with SK-HEP-1 shNC or SK-HEP-1 shSGOL2
  cells (s.c. n = 3, i.v. n = 7). Images of the isolated livers and tumors from sacrificed
  mice are presented, and the hepatic replacement area (HRA%) and the tumor volumes
  and tumor weights of the indicated groups were analyzed and compared. Loss of SGOL2
  in SK-HEP-1 cells contributed to the reduction in tumorigenesis. C-D, HE staining
  of metastatic tumors in liver and lung tissues. Representative images and quantitative
  analysis results are shown
article_title: SGOL2 is a novel prognostic marker and fosters disease progression
  via a MAD2-mediated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.
