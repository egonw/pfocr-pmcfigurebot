caption: KCNQ1OT1 may promote small cell lung cancer chemoresistance by regulating
  transforming growth factor-β and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signaling
  pathway. Analysis of mRNA expression of KCNQ1OT1, TGFB1, SMAD2, SMAD3, CDH1, TWIST1,
  ZEB-2, and VIM in H69AR (A) and H446DDP (D) cells, the protein expression of TWIST1,
  ZEB-2, VIM, E-CAD, TGFB1, SMAD2, and SMAD3 in H69AR-si (B) and H446DDP-si (E) cells
  were measured with western blotting and presented as histogram (C, F). *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01.
