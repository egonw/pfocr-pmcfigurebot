caption: Workflow Overview. Our methodology starts with time course experimental data,
  followed by network construction, differential network determination, community
  detection, sequential ordering by activation pattern, pathway analyses of individual
  communities, community hub gene interpretation, and final results including analyses
  and temporal trend visualizations.
