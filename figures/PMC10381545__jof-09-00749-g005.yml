caption: 'Specific activities of selected cytosolic enzymes. (A) glycolytic enzymes
  and the pentose phosphate pathway. (B) gluconeogenic enzymes and the FAS were determined
  in a clarified extract obtained from cells cultured for 24 h. Data are shown as
  the mean and standard deviation of 4 independent experiments. * Indicates a significant
  difference at p < 0.05, comparing minimal media with glucose and nitrate with the
  other conditions (ANOVA). Abbreviations: minimal media with glucose and nitrogen
  (G+N), glucose without nitrogen (G-N), acetate plus nitrogen (A+N), and acetate
  without nitrogen (A-N). HK, hexokinase; PFK-1, phosphofructokinase 1; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; FBPase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase;
  PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FAS, fatty acid
  synthase.'
