caption: Transcriptome analysis of GPR137-regulated genes. A Protein levels of GPR137
  in AGS cells transfected with GPR137 (GPR137, +) or an empty vector (GPR137, -)
  for 24 h were detected by western blot. The number of genes whose expression was
  altered by GPR137 is summarized in the table, and GO analysis was performed. One
  representative of 3 independent blots is shown. B KEGG was conducted to compare
  the gene expression from GPR137 group and the control. C Pathway enrichment analysis
  of (B). D Top cancer-related pathways were shown. E Immunohistochemistry staining
  for TAZ by using paraffin-embedded sections of cancer tissues and adjacent normal
  gastric epithelial tissues from patients with GC. N = 10, bar = 40 μm
