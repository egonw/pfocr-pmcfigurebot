caption: Bisulfite sequencing methylation analysis of individual CpG dinucleotides
  of BDNF promoter IV from mouse hippocampus. (A) The locations of the 19 CpG sites
  within promoter IV are listed, and the methylation status was assessed by bisulfite
  sequencing. The underlined sections represent CpG dinucleotide sites. (B) Methylation
  of promoter IV. White and black circles denote unmethylated and methylated CpG sites,
  respectively. Each row indicates a specific plasmid clone. Ten clones were from
  the same group.
