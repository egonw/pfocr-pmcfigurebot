caption: KEGG pathway GSEA analysis of COPZ1 low expression in multiple types of cancer.
  (A) The GSEA analysis showed the pathways activated in the low COPZ1 expression
  group in the BLCA. (B) The GSEA analysis showed the pathways activated in the low
  COPZ1 expression group in the BRCA. (C) The GSEA analysis showed the pathways activated
  in the low COPZ1 expression group in the HNSC. (D) The GSEA analysis showed the
  pathways activated in the low COPZ1 expression group in the LIHC. (E) The GSEA analysis
  showed the pathways activated in the low COPZ1 expression group in the LUAD. (F)
  The GSEA analysis showed the pathways activated in the low COPZ1 expression group
  in the UCEC.
