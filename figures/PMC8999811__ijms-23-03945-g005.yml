caption: 'Molecular mechanism of JA-GA-phyB crosstalk that governs growth and defense.
  When defense cues are generated, JA dominates the defense response and regulates
  the growth-defense balance together with GA/phyB. GA and phyB jointly inhibit plant
  growth under shade conditions, while JA and GA antagonize and regulate the plant
  growth response under growth status. Arrows: activations; bar-headed arrows: repressions;
  lines: interactions.'
