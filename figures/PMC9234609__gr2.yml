caption: miR-146b overexpression alleviates inflammation responses and blocks M1 polarization
  in macrophages. (A) The transfection efficacy of miR-146b overexpression was examined
  by q-PCR. (B) The levels of inflammation-related factors were determined by ELISA
  assay. (C) M1 macrophage polarization-related indicators were examined by Western
  blotting.
