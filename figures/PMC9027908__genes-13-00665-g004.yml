caption: Bubble plot represents the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways for
  the 23 dysregulated miRNAs. The coloured scale bar indicates the −LOG (Q-value)
  where yellow indicates more significance and blue indicates less significance. Q-value
  is the FDR adjusted p-value. Bubble size represents the number of genes targeted
  in that particular pathway (gene count). The y-axis represents the pathway rank
  from most to least significant (1 through 10). The x-axis represents the number
  of miRNAs that are enriched in a particular pathway relative to the number of target
  genes that are enriched in the same pathway, known as the miR:gene ratio.
