caption: 'Kub3 deletion has no effect on lung cell proliferation and cell apoptosis.
  (A) Immunostaining of PCNA in lung sections of E18.5 lungs. Nuclei were stained
  blue with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale bar: 20 µm. (B) Western blot
  analysis of PCNA protein level in E18.5 lungs. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (C) Cell apoptosis analysis of cells in E18.5 lungs examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
  transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Arrows indicate TUNEL-positive
  nuclei. Scale bar: 20 µm. (D) Western blot analysis of protein levels of caspase-3
  and cleaved caspase-3 in the KO lung at E18.5. GAPDH expression is the protein loading
  control.'
