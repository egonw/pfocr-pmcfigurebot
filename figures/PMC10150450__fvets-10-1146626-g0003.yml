caption: The metabolic pathway analysis identified differences between (A) MAP-infected
  vs. negative cattle and (B) MAP-infectious vs. negative cattle. In each plot, the
  top pathways were ranked by adjusted p-values (y-axis) and the total number of hits
  that determined the impact of the pathway (x-axis). Moreover, the node color was
  based on its p-value and the node radius was determined based on the pathway impact
  values. Large radius means high impact value, small radius means low impact value.
  Finally, the color graduates from white (high p-value) to yellow, orange, and red
  (low p-value). Cut-off values for pathway impact score >0.1, false discovery rate
  (FDR) < 0.25 and p-value < 0.05.
