caption: 'Resveratrol decreases serum-induced VM tube formation in prostate cancer
  cells. PC-3 (A) or DU145 cells (B) were seeded on a matrigel-coated a 24-well plate
  and treated with serum with or without RES. After a 16 h-incubation, the images
  were taken with an inverted microscope at 40 × magnification. Scale bar = 250 μm.
  The number of VM tube formation was counted and expressed as a percentage of the
  untreated control group. Data present as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  by analysis of Student’s t-test. ***p < 0.001 versus untreated control; ###p < 0.001
  versus serum-treated control.'

  the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.
