caption: miR-214-3p directly targeted PTEN. (a) The 3′-UTR of the human (hsa) and
  mouse (mmu) PTEN genes contained the miR-214-3p binding domain. (b) qPCR outcomes
  for the transfection efficiency of miR-214-3p mimics after 48 h transfection of
  the HK-2 cells. (c) The dual luciferase reporter analysis results after cotransfection
  of HK-2 cells using miR-214-3p/NC mimics plus WT/Mut PTEN 3′-UTR. The data rendered
  are in terms of means ± SDs, n = 3, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (d) Western blotting detected
  PTEN levels after 48 h transfection of the TGF-β1 and control groups separately
  using mimic of miR-214-3p or NC. GAPDH served as an internal reference.
