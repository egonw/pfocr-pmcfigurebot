caption: Gene sets associated with smooth muscle cell contraction, chemokine signaling,
  and cGMP signaling were affected in the caAcvr1:Nfatc1Cre mutants. (A) Heat maps
  of the upregulated and downregulated genes in mutant aortic valve tissues. (B) Volcano
  plot showing all 181 significantly differentially expressed genes in terms of their
  measured expression change (x-axis) and the significance of the change (y-axis).
  (C) Pathway perturbation vs. over-representation. The top five pathways plotted
  in terms of the total pathway accumulation (y-axis) and over-representation (x-axis).
  (D) Top pathways and their associated p-values.
