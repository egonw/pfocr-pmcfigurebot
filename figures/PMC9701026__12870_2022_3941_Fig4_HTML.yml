caption: Relative levels of intact lipid species of L. aequinoctialis culture cultivated
  under various melatonin concentrations. A pathway diagram of relative (relative
  intensity/g) lipid levels was proposed in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The data were normalized to an internal
  standard (PE 17:0/17:0) and then multiplied 100 times for simplicity. Vertical bars
  and error bars indicate the mean and standard deviation (n = 9, three biological
  replicates and three technical replicates) of the control group and the 0.1, 1,
  and 10 µM melatonin treatment groups on days 14 and 28. Black bars indicate no significant
  differences, red bars indicate statistically significant increases, and blue bars
  indicate statistically significant decreases by using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed
  by the Mann-Whitney test as a post hoc analysis with Bonferroni’s correction (p < 0.0083)

  metabolites in Lemna aequinoctialis culture by modulating metabolic and lipidomic
