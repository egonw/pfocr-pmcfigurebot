caption: Effects of S100A16 on the proliferation and migration of renal cancer cells.
  (a) CCK-8 was used in detecting the effect of S100A16 knockdown on the proliferation
  of renal cancer cells, and (b) clone creation was performed for the analysis of
  the inhibiting effects of S100A16 on renal cancer cell movement. Influence on cell
  clonogenicity, ∗∗p < 0.01. (c) The effect of S100A16 knockdown on the migration
  of renal cancer cells, ∗∗p < 0.01. Effects of knockdown of S100A16 on angiogenesis
  in renal cancer cells.
