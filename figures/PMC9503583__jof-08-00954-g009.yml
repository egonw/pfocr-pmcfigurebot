caption: Assays for interactions between UvSte50 and other proteins in U. virens.
  (A) Sub-cellular localization of UvSte50 in U. virens. Vegetative hyphae of transformant
  expressing UvSte50-GFP were observed under confocal fluorescence microscopy. Bar,
  10 μm. (B) A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to examine the interaction between
  UvSte50 and other proteins in U. virens. Yeast cells (104–106 cells/mL) of transformants
  containing prey and bait vectors were assayed for growth on SD/-Leu/-Trp and SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp
  medium.
