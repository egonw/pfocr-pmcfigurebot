caption: Glucose increases duodenal and jejunal contractility in control mice. Ex
  vivo measurement of the duodenal (A) (n = 9 vehicle, n = 5 for each glucose concentration)
  and jejunal (B) (n = 8 vehicle, n = 5 for glucose 1 and 2 mM, n = 4 for glucose
  5.5, 10, and 20 mM) mechanical contraction amplitude and frequency in response to
  Krebs–Ringer (vehicle) or glucose (1, 2, 5.5, 10 or 20 mM) and phloretin (E) (n
  = 5 for each condition) and (F) (n = 5 for vehicle and Phloretin groups, and n =
  4 for glucose 20 mM group) in fasting NC mice, and duodenal (C) (n = 10 vehicle
  and n = 4 glucose 1 and 2 mM, and n = 6 for glucose 5.5, 10, and 20 mM) and jejunal
  (D) (n = 12 vehicle and n = 5 glucose 1 and 2 mM, and n = 6 for glucose 5.5, 10,
  and 20 mM) mechanical contraction in fed mice in response to Krebs–Ringer (vehicle)
  or glucose (1, 2, 5.5, 10 or 20 mM) and phloretin (G) in duodenum and (H) in jejunum
  (n = 6 for each condition). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
