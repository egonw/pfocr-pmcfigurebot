caption: 'GRWD1 knockdown suppresses triple negative breast cancer cell invasion and
  migration. (A and B) The invasion and migration of (A) MDA-MB-231 and (B) HCC1937
  cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by Matrigel and wound healing assays,
  respectively. (C) The expression of metastasis-related proteins in MDA-MB-231 and
  HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by western blotting. (D)
  The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins in MDA-MB-231
  and HCC1937 cells transfected with siRNA-GRWD1 was detected by western blotting.
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs.
  siRNA-NC group. GRWD1, glutamate-rich WD-repeat-containing protein 1; siRNA, small
  interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
