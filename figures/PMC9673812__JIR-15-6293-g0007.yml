caption: Inhibition of AMPK signaling eliminates the protective effect of Sodium tanshinone
  IIA sulfonate on cholesterol crystals-induced mitochondrial damage. HUVECs were
  incubated with 500 μM cholesterol crystals (CC) for 16 h and 40 μM Sodium tanshinone
  IIA sulfonate (STS) was added 1 h before CC treatment. 10 μM Dorsomorphin was added
  2 h before STS treatment. (A) Representative images of TMRE staining in HUVECs that
  were stained with TMRE (red, to label MMP) and Hoechst 33342 (blue, to label nuclear).
  (B) HUVECs were stained with Mito-SOX probe (red, to label mtROS), Mito-tracker
  Green (green, to label mitochondrial) and Hoechst 33342 (blue, to label nuclear)
  and images were detected under Confocal High-Content Imaging System. Data are represented
  as mean ± SD of three independent replicates; **P < 0.01 vs VEH group; §§P < 0.01
  vs cholesterol crystals group; ††P < 0.01 vs STS treatment group; Scale bar = 10 μm.
