caption: RUT protects against LPS-induced ER stress by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling
  pathway. The expression levels of ER stress-related proteins CHOP, GRP78, caspase-12
  and ATF6 were evaluated by western blotting. Results are presented as the mean Â±
  SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; GRP78, glucose
  regulated protein-78; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RUT, rutaecarpine.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
