caption: 'Blebbistatin inhibited LPS-induced activation of NMMHC IIA/Wnt5a/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in pulmonary endothelium in mice. Immunofluorescence staining
  for (A) NMMHC IIA, (B) Wnt5a, (C) β-catenin, (green) and CD31 (red) were performed
  on frozen lung sections, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar
  =20 μm. The fluorescence intensity of these proteins in lung endothelium was quantified
  by Image J (n = 3). Data are shown as the means ± SD (A-C). n = 3. ##P < 0.01 vs.
  the control group; **P < 0.01 vs. the LPS group.'
article_title: The myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin, ameliorates pulmonary endothelial
  barrier dysfunction in acute lung injury induced by LPS via NMMHC IIA/Wnt5a/β-catenin
  pathway.
