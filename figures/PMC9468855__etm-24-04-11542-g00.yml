caption: 'RRM2 is involved in the osteogenic differentiation of MEFs. (A) Volcano
  plot of differentially expressed genes. (B) The heat map of the top 30 differentially
  expressed genes. Red indicates upregulation and blue indicates downregulation. Differentially
  expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.01; |log2 fold change|>1.5) were selected
  from bone morphogenetic protein 9-induced osteogenic differentiation RNA sequencing
  data (). (C) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis revealed endogenous
  RRM2 expression in some progenitor cells. (D and E) WB and semi-quantification of
  WB indicated RRM2 protein expression in MEFs cultured with osteogenic inducing medium
  from day 0 to 21. (F) Green fluorescence and cells were imaged 24 h after transfection
  with negative control adenovirus labeled with green fluorescence protein and RRM2-overexpressing
  recombinant adenovirus using a fluorescence microscope. Scale bar=200 µm (magnification,
  x100). ##P<0.01 vs. C3H10T1/2. **P<0.01 vs. Day 0 group. RRM2, ribonucleotide reductase
  M2; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; WB, western blotting.'
