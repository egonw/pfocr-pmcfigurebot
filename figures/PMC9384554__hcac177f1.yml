caption: Proteomic analysis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with or
  without Omicron SARS-CoV-2 recurrence. (a) Volcano plots compare pairs of patient
  groups as indicated in the plot. Proteins with fold-change >1.2 and P-value <0.05
  were considered as significantly differential expressions; (b) Heatmap plot of 40
  differentially expressed proteins (fold-change >1.2 and P-value <0.05) between Omi-Rec
  patients and Omi-Neg controls; (c) PCA of 40 circulating proteomes; (d) Top 16 pathways
  dysregulated in Omi-Rec patients. Pathway analysis was performed based on 40 differentially
  expressed proteins using the R package (ClusterProfiler 3.14.3). P-value <0.05 was
  considered statistically significant; (e) Differential expression of APOA1, APOA2,
  PLTP, APOA4, HLA-DRA, CTSS, HK3, ARSG and TF across the Omi-Rec and Omi-Neg groups.
  Omi-Rec, Omicron SARS-CoV-2 recurred positive after discharge; Omi-Neg, Omicron
  SARS-CoV-2 maintained negative after discharge; Om, Omicron; _rec, _recurrence;
  _rec_rep, _recurrence_replication.
article_title: A unique dysregulation pattern of lipid metabolism and immune responses
  in patients with omicron SARS-CoV-2 recurrence.
