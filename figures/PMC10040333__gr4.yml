caption: SESN2 deletion affected the activation of LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway by
  exercise or gAd in skeletal muscle.Representative Western blot (A) and densitometric
  quantification of LKB1 (B), SESN2 (C), AMPK, pAMPK-Thr172 (D) in quadriceps of male
  WT and SESN2−/− mice following six-week exercise or gAd treatment (n ​= ​3/per group).
  β-tubulin was used as the internal control. Data were presented as means ​± ​standard
  error of the mean (SEM); ∗, p ​< ​0.05. HC - HFD control, HE - HFD exercise group,
  HC ​+ ​gAd - HFD gAd inject group, WT - wild type, SESN2 - Sestrin2, AMPK - AMP-activated
  protein kinase, LKB1 - Liver kinase B1.

  by enhancing the LKB1-mediated AMPK activation via SESN2.
