caption: The inhibitory effects of NA on multiple cancer-associated signaling pathways
  in human CR ovarian cancer cell lines. (A) Effect of NA on the 12 cancer-associated
  pathways in SKOV3CR cells. SKOV3CR cells were transfected with the Gaussia luciferase
  reporter plasmids for the 12 cancer-associated pathways and treated with varying
  concentrations of NA for 48 h. The culture medium was collected for Gaussia luciferase
  assay using the Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD). Each
  conditioned assay was done in triplicate. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with that
  of the cells treated with 0 μM NA. (B) The inhibitory effect of NA on four cancer-associated
  pathways in a dose- or time-dependent manner. The four most affected pathway reporter
  plasmids AP1 (a), ELK/SRF (b), HIF1 (c), and TCF/LEF (d) were transfected into SKOV3CR
  cells as described in (A). The transfected cells were treated with varying concentrations
  of NA for 24 h or 48 h. The culture media were taken for Gaussia Luciferase activity
  assays. Each conditioned assay was done in triplicate. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared
  with that of the cells treated with 0 μM NA.
