caption: Workflow associating NAFLD subtypes with gene expression signatures to computationally
  predict and prioritize drugs for testing in a patient-derived microphysiological
  model of disease progression. Four integrated units are shown, each comprised of
  a set of steps detailed in the Methods and Results. Unit 1A–D identifies and clusters
  individual patient hepatic gene expression and enriched pathway profiles associated
  with clinical subtypes and categorizes the differentially enriched pathways among
  these clusters ( and ; , and ) within our current framework of NAFLD pathophysiology
  [,]. The rationale is presented in the Results for using clusters based on individual
  patient pathway enrichment profiles as an alternative to the clinical classifications
  (compare , ) for determining both differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways
  between different stages of disease progression. Unit 2E–G generates disease progression-based
  gene expression signatures () and, using the Connectivity Map (CMap) databases,
  identifies drugs that can normalize these signatures ( and ). The highly integrative
  Unit 3 H-J maps known protein targets of the predicted drugs from Unit 2 to an NAFLD
  subnetwork encompassing protein targets from the gene expression analysis within
  Unit 1 (, and ). A network proximity score is then calculated that helps prioritize
  candidate drugs identified by CMap analysis for experimental testing based on the
  proximity of their targets to the NAFLD subnetwork (). In Unit 4K, the effects of
  the prioritized drugs on a diverse set NAFLD–associated biomarkers in a human MPS,
  independently shown to recapitulate critical aspects of NAFLD progression (Unit
  4L) (, ), are determined ( and ).  provides an index of tables, figures, and data
  files associated with each step.
