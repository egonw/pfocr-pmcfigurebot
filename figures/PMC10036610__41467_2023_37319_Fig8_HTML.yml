figure_title: Diagram of the action of the DA system in the cerebellum
caption: Our findings suggest a model in which PCs synthesize DA through a non-canonical
  pathway and secrete it in an activity-dependent manner. The released DA binds D1Rs
  in BGs, inducing membrane depolarization and Ca2+signaling and driving membrane
  insertion of AMPAR GluA1 subunits. These actions may trigger glutamate release from
  BGs, which then enhances interneuron activity and reduces PF- and CF-PC synaptic
  transmission by potentially activating presynaptic GluRs. The increased inhibitory
  and the reduced excitatory inputs to PCs alter their firing frequency and pattern,
  ultimately impacting locomotor and social behaviors. BG, Bergmann glial cell; GC,
