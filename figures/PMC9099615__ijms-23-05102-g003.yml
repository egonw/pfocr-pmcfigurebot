caption: 'Ailanthoidol induced cell cycle arrest in Huh7 cells: (A) Huh7 cells were
  treated with or without ATD (10 μM) for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. The harvested cells
  were stained with PI, and the DNA content was analyzed using a flow cytometer. The
  histograms are from one out of three experiments; (B) values are presented as means
  ± SD (n = 3). ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. o h; (C) Huh7 cells were treated with
  or without ATD for 24 h. The cells were harvested and equal protein amounts of the
  whole-cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting against the indicated antibodies.
  α- tubulin was used as the loading control.'
