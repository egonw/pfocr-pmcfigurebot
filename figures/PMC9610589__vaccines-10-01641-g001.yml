caption: 'Possible BCG vaccine cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanism of
  action. The effectiveness of the immune response consists in the balanced reactivity
  of both innate and adaptive immunity and their cooperation. It has been shown that
  cells of innate immunity (for example, macrophages) undergo a process of immune
  training underpinned by epigenetic changes. BCG, through the induction of epigenetic
  reprogramming (manifested, for instance, by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  at appropriate levels), can provide cross-protection during a subsequent infection
  caused by an infectious agent other than the primary one. Genes, particularly interferon-related,
  are also subject to epigenetic control by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infection of
  which may be accompanied by the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  leading to a cytokine storm. The interferon pathway is one of the most important
  signaling pathways in the course of infection. In viral infection, an increase in
  the levels of ISGs is observed, whose stimulation results in the inhibition of viral
  replication. The BCG vaccine, in particular, leads to the upregulation of ISG15,
  which may confirm its contribution to the inhibition of viral infection. However,
  in the case of SARS-CoV-2, its ability to alleviate some ISG15 anti-viral activities
  was reported. Among the components of the interferon pathway are IFIT proteins.
  The antiviral properties of IFIT1 are manifested by the recognition of RNA having
  5′ triphosphate and lacking 2′-O methylation, followed by the sequestration of the
  viral nucleic acid. The elevated IFIT1 levels observed after BCG vaccination may
  indicate its usefulness in mitigating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it
  was reported that M. bovis BCG contains similar T cells epitops asSARS-CoV-2. The
  consequence of this can be the production of cross-reactive antibodies by antigen-specific
  B lymphocytes. Hence, it has been suggested that BCG immunization, as well as latent
  M. tuberculosis infection, may result in an increased effectiveness of the immune
  system against SARS-CoV-2, not only due to the training of innate immunity but also
  through the generation of antibodies with cross-reactivity. Abbreviations: CCL3—CC
  motif chemokine ligand 3 (MIP-1α), CCL3L1—CC motif chemokine ligand 3 like 1, CXCL8/10—CXC
