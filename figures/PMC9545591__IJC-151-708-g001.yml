caption: Associations of transsulfuration metabolites with risk of RCC at specified
  levels of BMI within a nested case‐control study in EPIC (N = 455 cases and 455
  controls). Estimates shown are contrasts from the mutually adjusted model with separate
  interaction terms added for each metabolite with BMI as a continuous predictor.
  The expected log predictive density (ELPD) difference and its SE were used for model
  comparison against the mutually adjusted model without interaction terms. A negative
  ELPD indicates a worse fit for the interaction model, and the SE indicates the precision
  of the comparison of model fit
