caption: KEGG analyses of DEGs between control and CORT treated group in 6–8 mm GCs.
  (A-B) Heat map shows the DEGs enriched into the steroid biosynthesis (A) and steroid
  hormone biosynthesis (B) signaling pathway, respectively. (C) The protein-protein
  interaction between the above enriched DEGs is based on the STRING database. (D)
  qRT-PCR validation of several DEGs identified in transcriptome sequencing, including
  LSS, SQLE, CYP51A1, EBP, DHCR24, FDFT1, MSMO1, DHCR7, StAR, and HSD3B1. Each data
  point represents the mean ± SEM of at least three replicates (N ≥ 3). Significant
  differences between CORT treatment and control group are indicated with asterisks
  * or **, reflecting P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively.
