caption: Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins responding to fasudil.
  Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins
  in the brain of PS19 transgenic mice dosed with fasudil 30 mg/kg/day [(A, C) respectively]
  or 100 mg/kg/day [(B, D) respectively] as compared to the control group (Veh, saline).
  The most significantly enriched biological process, cellular components and molecular
  functions are represented by bar graphs, while the top significantly affected pathways
  are represented by bubble plots.

  in the tau transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
