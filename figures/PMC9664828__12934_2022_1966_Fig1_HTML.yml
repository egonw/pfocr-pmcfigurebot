caption: Properties of overexpression strains on flask-level cultivation. a, Biomass
  accumulation of all strains with supplement of inducer DOX since 18 h. b, c, Glucoamylase
  activity and total secreted protein of all strains with the supplement of inducer
  since either 18 or 42 h. DCW, dry cell weight. DOX, doxycycline. Genes hyp, cyp,
  fadE, fadA and acy were overexpressed in strains OE-hyp, OE-cyp, OE-fadE, OE-fadA
  and OE-acy. Error bars represent the standard errors of average values from three
  biological replicates
