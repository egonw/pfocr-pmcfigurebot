caption: Global metabolic perturbations in response to atovaquone. ECC-1 cells were
  treated with atovaquone (ATO) or vehicle control (CTRL) for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, 12
  and 24 h. 1H NMR of cell lysates and the resulting metabolite concentration data
  (ChenomX) was auto scaled and analyzed with MetaboAnalyst. (A) PCA scores plot demonstrates
  time and group effects, with significant treatment effect not observed until 6+
  hours of exposure (each data point represents a unique replicate; bounding ellipses
  represent 95% confidence intervals). (B) PLS-DA scores plot of combined 6 and 12
  h time points for ATO and CTRL groups. (C) Variable importance in projection (VIP)
  scores for the top 15 metabolites along principle component 1 of PLS-DA in panel
  B, which account for difference between ATO and CTRL groups. (D) Metabolite set
  enrichment analysis between ATO and CTRL groups at 6 and 12 h identifying significantly
  enriched pathways (Tot = total number of metabolites within annotated pathway; Hits
  = number of pathway metabolites present in this data set, % = percent coverage of
  pathway; table cutoff values of 2 hits, 20% coverage, Q-statistic > 50; black =
  FDR > 0.05). GPC = syn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.
