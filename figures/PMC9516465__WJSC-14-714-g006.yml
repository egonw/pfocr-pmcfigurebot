caption: 'SNHG16 overexpression resulted in activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and
  a significant enhancement in the proliferative rate of human placenta-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells. A: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis
  of relative SNHG16 expression after transfection of lentivirus overexpressing SNHG16
  (SNHG16-OE) and the corresponding empty vector in human placenta-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells; B: Cell proliferation after SNHG16 overexpression was evaluated by cell
  counting kit-8 assay; C: Cell cycle distribution after SNHG16 overexpression was
  evaluated by flow cytometry; D: The expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin
  E1, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated AKT. Data are presented as the means Â± SD obtained
  from three separate experiments. bP < 0.01.'
