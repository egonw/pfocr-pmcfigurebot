caption: 'Effects of UA and DOX on migration and the EMT pathway in HCT116 and HT-29
  CRC cells. (A) Migration of CRC cells was assessed using a wound healing assay following
  treatment with 15 µM UA or 1.5 µM DOX or a combination. The cell migration ability
  was significantly inhibited when treated with the combination at 24 and 48 h. (B)
  Western blotting was used to semi-quantify EMT pathway-associated protein expression
  levels of E-cadherin, uPA and MMP-9 following UA and DOX treatment for 48 h in HCT116
  and HT-29 CRC cells. Values were normalized to GAPDH. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control,
  #P<0.05, ##P<0.01. vs. UA/DOX. CONT, control; UA, ursolic acid; DOX, doxorubicin;
  MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase-9; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; ns,
  not significant; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.'
article_title: Inhibition of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis by ursolic acid and doxorubicin
  is mediated by targeting the Akt signaling pathway and activating the Hippo signaling
  pathway.
