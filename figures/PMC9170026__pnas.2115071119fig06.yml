caption: Efficacy studies with IKAM-1 in PC models. (A–C) Evaluation of IKAM-1 for
  pathway specific inhibition in HeLa cell lines that stably express a luciferase
  reporter gene under the control of either NF-κB response element or p53 response
  element or AP1 response element (n = 3). (D) Growth inhibition studies with analog
  12, IKAM-1, TPCA1, and BMS345541 in a panel of PC cell lines (MiaPaCa2, AsPC-1,
  Suit2, S2013, and T3M4). Cell viability was determined using PrestoBlue following
  incubation of compounds for 72 h (n = 3). (E) MiaPaCa2 and T3M4 cell lines were
  treated with IKAM-1, IKAM-1 + Z-Vad, TPCA1, BMS345541, or LCL161 for 24 h. Apoptosis
  assessed by measuring the induction of caspase 3/7 activity using the Caspase-Glo
  3/7 system (n = 3). (F and G) IKAM-1 inhibits PC tumor growth. T3M4 cells (3 × 105
  cells) were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of athymic nude mice (n =
  6). Tumors were treated with vehicle control and IKAM-1 (40 mg/kg, by mouth for
  28 d). Tumor volume and weight were measured at the time of killing. (H) Average
  histoscore of p-IKKβ IHC in vehicle and IKAM-1–treated tumor-bearing animals (n
  = 5). Data represented as average ± SEM (n = 5), P value determined by unpaired
  Student’s t test. ND, not determined.
