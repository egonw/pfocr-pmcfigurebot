caption: 'Friedelin reduced blood cholesterol and triglyceride abundance in adult
  mice. (a) TC levels, (b) TG levels, (c) HDL levels, (d) LDL and (e) VLDL levels
  are given in histogram. The results are expressed as mean ± SEM employing one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post-test. Significance of control
  vs. scopolamine is expressed as #, while * denotes scopolamine vs. scopolamine +
  friedelin/glutinol. Significance: ns = non-significant *, # p < 0.05, **, ## p <
  0.01 (n = 5).'
