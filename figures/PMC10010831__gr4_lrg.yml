caption: 'Enrichment analyses for proteins associated with COVID-19 infection, ventilation
  and death(A) We performed pathway enrichment analyses via clusterProfiler using
  Entrez gene symbol of the robustly identified proteins (841 proteins for infection,
  833 proteins for ventilation, 253 proteins for death). These proteins were enriched
  for 16 pathways. Two differentially abundant proteins (CSF1 and GFRA3) for 3 outcomes
  were enriched in COVID-19 related pathways. Proteins were significantly enriched
  for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathway (FDR = 1.0 × 10−2 for COVID-19 infection).
  Enrichment of COVID-19 infection (FDR = 1.0 × 10−2) was observed for coronary artery
  disease. The detailed results are in .(B) Forest plots of AD-related proteins: APP,
  NFL, EPHA5, and TMEM106B. MAPT and GFAP showed a nominal significance (p < 0.05).(C)
  Forest plots of cardiovascular-related proteins: Troponin T (cardiac muscle), ANGL4,
  FURIN, AT1B1 and TGFB1.(D) We performed tissue-specific enrichment analyses via
  FUMA for 30 tissues in GTEx v8. We found significant enrichment for lung (FDR =
  3.21 × 10−5). The detailed results are in .'
