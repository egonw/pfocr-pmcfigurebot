caption: Recognition of viral RNA by cellular PRR. RIG-I and MDA5 are immune sensors
  of the RLR family involved in the recognition of viral RNA. Following binding of
  viral dsRNA, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the MAVS via CARDs to transduce pleiotropic
  signaling via different kinase complexes. This leads to the activation and phosphorylation
  of transcription factors (NFκB, IRF3/IRF7), their entry into the nucleus, and initiation
  of expression of type I IFNs and antiviral genes, which mediate a cellular host
  defense program to fight infection. In parallel, RNA from viruses can also induce
  the transcription of type I IFNs and antiviral genes through TLR signaling pathways.
  dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; IFN, interferon; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B; PRR, proline rich region; TLR, Toll-like receptor;
  Ub, ubiquitin. Color images are available online.
