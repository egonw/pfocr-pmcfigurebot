caption: Concomitant gene silencing with cannabidiol (CBD) treatment and role of metallothionein
  MT‐2A in response to bis‐diethyldithiocarbamate‐copper complex (CuET) analyzed by
  XTT assay (A) CBD pretreatment does not protect MTF1‐silenced cells from CuET toxicity.
  Cells were pretreated with 10 μm CBD for 17 h and treated with 10 μm CBD and increasing
  concentration of CuET for 72 h. The result represents the mean and standard deviation
  of three independent experiments (n = 3). (B) MT‐2A‐silenced cells are sensitized
  to CuET treatment. CBD pretreatment protects MT‐2A‐silenced cells from CuET toxicity
  only partially. Cells were pretreated with 10 μm CBD for 17 h and treated with 10 μm
  CBD and increasing concentration of CuET for 72 h. The result represents the mean
  and standard deviation of three independent experiments (n = 3).
