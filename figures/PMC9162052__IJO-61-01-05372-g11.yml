caption: Regulation of the mTORC2/Akt and PDK1/Akt signaling pathway by MDIG. Western
  blot analysis was used to examine the mTORC2/Akt and PDK1/Akt signaling pathways.
  GAPDH was used as the loading control. Phosphoproteins were presented as the ratio
  of phosphoprotein to total protein. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. Con or Vector group (one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test). MDIG, mineral dust-induced gene; Con,
  control; LV, lentiviral vector; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; P, phosphorylated; PDK1,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; mTORC2, mTOR complex 2.
article_title: MDIG, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, acts as an oncogene and
  predicts the prognosis of multiple types of cancer.
