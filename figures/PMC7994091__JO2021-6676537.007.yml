  of cell cycle. (b) Enriched score for signatures in the pathway of apoptosis. (c)
  Enriched score for signatures in the pathway of NOD like receptor signaling. (d)
  Enriched score for signatures in the pathway of Notch signaling. (e) Enriched score
  for signatures in pathways of cancer. (f) Enriched score for signatures in the pathway
  of VEGF signaling.
