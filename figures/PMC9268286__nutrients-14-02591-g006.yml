caption: 'Drug D alleviates TXNIP up-regulation and oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis.
  (ai,aii,bi,bii) Representative immunofluorescence staining of TXNIP (red), HIF-1α
  (red) and DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded of pancreas tissues
  (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (ci–ciii) The expressions of TXNIP and REDD1 were analyzed
  by Western blot in pancreas tissues (n = 8). (d–g) The levels of MDA, GSH, CAT and
  GPX of pancreas tissues were measured by the corresponding kit (n = 3). All values
  were shown as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 compared with control group, Δp < 0.05,
  ΔΔp < 0.01 vs. Drug D (5 mg/kg) group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared
  with mice acute pancreatitis model groups. Unpaired Student’s t-tests were used
  in (aii,bii,cii,ciii,d–g).'
