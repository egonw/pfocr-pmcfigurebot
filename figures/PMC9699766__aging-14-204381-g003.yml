caption: HHIP protein inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. (A) We constructed
  HHIP-silenced (si-HHIP) and HHIP-overexpressed (HHIP) BM-MSCs. RUNX2, OCN, ALP and
  OPN protein levels were detected after 14 days of osteogenic induction of the BM-MSCs.
  (B) ALP and (C) alizarin red staining after 14 days of osteogenic induction of BM-MSCs.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
article_title: lncRNA HHIP-AS1/HHIP modulates osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs
  by regulating Hedgehog signaling pathway.
