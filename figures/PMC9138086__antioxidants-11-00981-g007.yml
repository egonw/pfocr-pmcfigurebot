caption: 'Quantification a* value of dorsal skin upon Ficus awkeotsang Makino extract
  (FAE) treatment at different concentrations following UVB irradiation on BALB/c
  nude mice from 0 to 10 weeks. Statistically significant differences from the control
  were observed with * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; statistically significant
  difference from UVB-exposure group was observed with # p < 0.05, ### p < 0.001 statistical
  significance was determined using Tukey’s HSD test. n = 3; all error bars represent
  the standard deviation of the mean.'
