caption: Competitive binding assay and the schematic summarizing the key findings
  of this study. (A) Indicated concentrations of competing IL‐6 (0–2000 pg/ml) were
  incubated with 1 mM Dexa and/or Cane at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation, the competitive
  binding of Dexa and/or Cane to IL‐6 was evaluated by competitive ELISA. The current
  data showed that Dexa had a higher affinity to IL‐6 than Cane at the same concentration.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). *p < .05 versus IL‐6 + 1 mM Dexa + 1 mM
  Cane group; ▲p < .05 versus IL‐6 + 1 mM Cane group. Statistical comparisons were
  conducted with one‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test. (B) Dexa and Cane competitively
  engage in IL‐6‐mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, in which Dexa was dominant
  in binding to IL‐6, thus regulating tactile allodynia during inflammatory pain development.
  Cane, potassium canrenoate; Dexa, dexamethasone; ELISA, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent
  assays; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; IL‐6R, interleukin‐6 receptor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2;
  STAT3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
