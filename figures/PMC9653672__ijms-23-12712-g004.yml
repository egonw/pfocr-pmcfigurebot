caption: WGCNA showing the mechanism of the downstream regulation of the RIOK2 gene.
  (A) WGCNA cluster dendrogram and module assignment. Colors in horizontal bars indicate
  modules, and branches refer to highly connected gene clusters. (B) Heatmap of the
  correlation between the module eigengenes and different treatment groups. Each cell
  contains the correlation coefficient and p-value. (C) Overlapping differentially
  expressed genes and WGCNA blue module hub genes uncover key hub DEGs in DON-induced
  cytotoxicity regulation. (D) Cluster analysis graph of differential gene samples
  between different groups. (E) GO enrichment analysis of 803 hub genes. (F) KEGG
  pathway analysis of 803 hub genes. The significance of enrichment gradually increases
  from blue to red, and the size of the dots indicates the number of genes contained
  in the corresponding pathway. (G) qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes.
  (H) Inhibition of RIOK2 promotes the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in
  DON-induced IPEC-J2.
