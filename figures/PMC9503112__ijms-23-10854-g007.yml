caption: Reactive oxygen species production in the presence of compounds 7. (a,b)
  SkBr-3 (a) and MCF7 (b) ROS production expressed as the ratios of intracellular
  ROS production by the stimulated cells to the control ones. (câ€“f) Microphotographs
  of SkBr-3 cells in the presence of compound 7c. Black arrows show dying cells, blue
  arrows show unable to duplicate DNA cells.
