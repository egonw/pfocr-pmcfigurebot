figure_title: CLTX-T-CAR neutrophil-mediated tumor lysis involves phagocytosis, ROS
  production, and NET formation
caption: (A and B) Representative images of immunological synapses indicated by polarized
  F-actin accumulation at the interface between CAR neutrophils and tumor cells are
  shown in (A), and the numbers of formed synapses are quantified in (B). Neu, neutrophils;
  Tu, tumor cells. Scale bars, 10 μm.(C) The numbers of immunological synapses formed
  between CLTX-T-CAR neutrophils and indicated cells were quantified. Data are represented
  as mean ± SD of three independent replicates.(D and E) Time-dependent phagocytosis
  of glioblastoma cells by neutrophils is shown. Phagocytosis was significantly blocked
  when treated with 5-μM cytochalasin D (CytoD). Representative bright-field (bright)
  and fluorescent images of phagocytotic disruption of Calcein-AM-labeled tumor cells
  (D) and flow cytometry analysis of CLTX-T-CAR neutrophils during phagocytosis (E)
  are shown. Scale bars, 10 μm.(F) ROS generation during CLTX-T-CAR neutrophil phagocytosis
  with or without 5-mM acetylcysteine (NAC) was quantified.(G) Formation of neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs) in CLTX-T-CAR neutrophils treated with indicated doses
  of propofol was quantified using PicoGreen.(H) Tumor lysis of CLTX-T-CAR neutrophils
  treated with or without 5-μM CytoD, 5-mM NAC, and 5-μM propofol was quantified.(I)
  Total and phospho-protein analysis of Syk-Erk signaling pathway in cell lysates
  of CLTX-T-CAR and CLTX-NK-CAR neutrophils via western blotting was performed with
  or without tumor cell coincubation.(J) Schematic of activated Syk-Erk signaling
  pathway in CAR neutrophils after binding to MMP2.
