caption: Identification of upregulated genes in DKD associated with COVID-19 pathways.
  (a) Diagram of overlapping DEGs among DKD and the COVID-19 pathways. The intersection
  of 41 genes in the COVID-19 pathway is shown. (b) (i) The KEGG pathway map hsa05171
  is involved in Coronavirus disease-COVID-19. The rectangle in red color (light to
  dark), according to log Log2FC, indicates the upregulated DEGs overlapping DKD and
  COVID-19. (ii) the Reactome pathway R-hsa-9694516 and (iii) the GO term corresponding
  to renal system development. (c) Functional enrichment analysis of the shared genes
  among DKD and COVID-19 pathways. FDR is calculated based on a nominal p-value from
  the hypergeometric test. Fold Enrichment is defined as the percentage of DEGs belonging
  to a pathway divided by the corresponding percentage in the background. FDR reports
  how likely the Enrichment is by chance. Higher values are colored on a scale of
  red to blue. In the x-axis, Fold Enrichment indicates how drastically genes of a
  specific pathway are overrepresented.
