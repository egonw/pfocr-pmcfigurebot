caption: 'RhoA pathway is up‐regulated in DMD and PDGF‐AA activates it. (A) Molecular
  pathway of RhoA/ROCK2 signalling downstream of ArhGEF2 which catalyses the replacement
  of Rhoa‐GDP to RhoA‐GTP, controlling the RhoA activation. RhoA bound to GTP activates
  the rho‐associated coiled coil‐forming protein kinase (ROCK), a serine/threonine
  kinase that regulates actin filament remodelling trough light chain myosin (MLC)
  phosphorylation. (B) Quantification of WB bands of ArhGEF2 relative to total protein
  detection and representative bands of ArhGEF2 expression in muscle tissue obtained
  from healthy controls (n = 2) and DMD patients (n = 2). Total protein detection
  was used as loading control signal (Figure ). (C) Optical density at 490 nm indicating
  RhoA activity relative to total RhoA protein detected by WB. (D) Representative
  images of p‐MLC staining using fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar: 50 μm. (E) Quantification
  of p‐MLC intensity of each cell after different treatments. (F) Representative images
  FAPs stained with phalloidin after different treatments. Scale bar: 50 μm. C‐: Untreated
  FAPs. Data are represented as the mean of three replicates ± standard error of the
  mean. Results were statistically analysed using one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey
  post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.'
