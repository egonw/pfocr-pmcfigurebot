caption: The concept of agnostic therapy. Some tumor vulnerabilities are shared across
  various cancer types; therefore, their targeting is potentially effective irrespective
  of the histological origin of a given malignancy. Activating mutations in kinases
  involved in the MAPK signaling pathway are the best established agnostic targets.
  High tumor mutation burden, which may be caused by external carcinogens, errors
  in DNA repair pathways, or alterations in DNA polymerases, is associated with increased
  tumor antigenicity and, therefore, its sensitivity to immune therapy. Homologous
  recombination deficiency may be attributed to the inactivation of BRCA1/2 or some
  other genes; it renders tumor responsiveness to DNA double-strand-break-inducing
  drugs.
