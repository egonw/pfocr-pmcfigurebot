caption: Hydrogen inhibits CRC cell proliferation in vitro. As shown in (a), the proliferation
  results demonstrated that H2 had a good inhibitory effect on SW480 cells, even at
  low concentrations (30%), while only high concentrations (more than 50%) of H2 suppressed
  RKO and HCT116 cells growth, as determined by the CCK-8 assay. (b) 50% hydrogen
  decreased cell viability compared to the ctrl group in a time-dependent manner at
  24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm by CCK8 assay
  in RKO, SW480, and HCT116 cells. (c) The colony formation assay showed that 50%
  H2 decreased the number of colonies arising from RKO, SW480, and HCT116 cells.
