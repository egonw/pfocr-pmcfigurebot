caption: 5D3PC promoted melanogenesis in B16 cells (A) Chemical structure of the 5D3PC;
  (B) Different concentrations (0–50 μM) of 5D3PC on B16 cell viability were measured
  by CCK-8 assay. Morphological changes in 5D3PC treated B16 cells at 200× magnification.
  (a) 0.1%DMSO (b) 1 µM 5D3PC, (c) 10 µM 5D3PC, and (d) 50 µM 5D3PC. (C) Effect of
  5D3PC on melanin content and TYR activity in B16 cells. Melanin content of B16 cells
  treated with different concentrations (1, 10, and 50 µM) of 5D3PC for 48 h. TYR
  activity in the similarly treated B16 melanoma cells. DMSO (0.1%) was used as the
  vehicle control, and 8-MOP (50 µM) as the positive control. (D) Western blotting
  assays determined the levels of melanogenic genes in B16 cells treated with different
  concentrations (0–50 µM) of 5D3PC. All results are expressed as mean ± SD; statistical
  analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared with NC (negative control)
  group.
