caption: Effects of tannic acid extracted from Galla chinensis supplementation on
  expressions of inflammatory pathway genes in intestinal mucosa of broiler chickens.
  (A) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4); (B) Myeloid differentiation primary response 88
  (MyD88); (C) Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). CON, broiler chickens fed basal diet;
  TA, broiler chickens fed basal diet supplemented with 300 mg/kg microencapsulated
  tannic acid extracted from Galla chinensis. Values are mean ± standard error (n
  = 6). Differences between treatments were displayed by * p < 0.05.
