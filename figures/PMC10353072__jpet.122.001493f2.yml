caption: Comparison of enriched metabolic pathways for the ND group versus the combined
  T2D groups. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis showing pathways that are significantly
  altered at P = 0.05 level. (B) Pathway analysis with significantly altered metabolite
  groups highlighted. (C) ChemRich analysis using chemical similarity to show the
  trend in features that are modified. In C, blue is downregulated compared with control,
  red is upregulated, and purple is mixed.
