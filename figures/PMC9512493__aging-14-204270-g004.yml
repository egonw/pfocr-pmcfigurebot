caption: The co-expression network of ALDH6A1 in gastric cancer. (A) The LinkedOmics
  database has implicated the genes that possessed strong correlation with ALDH6A1
  in GC. (B, C) The heatmaps has implied the top genes that owned positive and negative
  relationship with ALDH6A1 in GC. (D) The survival heatmaps has illustrated the top
  genes that were positively and negatively related to ALDH6A1 in GC. (E, F) GO and
  KEGG pathway of ALDH6A1 in GC.
article_title: The downregulated drug-metabolism related ALDH6A1 serves as predictor
  for prognosis and therapeutic immune response in gastric cancer.
