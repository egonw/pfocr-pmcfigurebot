caption: 'Effects of fucoxanthin on the toll-like receptor 4-mediated (TLR4)-induced
  inflammatory response. (A) Western blot analysis of TLR4, myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88), and p-IκBα and p-NF-κB p65 in the FFA-treated cells; (B) the
  protein levels of TLR4; (C) the protein levels of MyD88; (D) the protein levels
  of p-IκBα; (E) the protein levels of p-NF-κB p65. Data are expressed as mean ± standard
  deviation (n = 3), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. control group, ## p < 0.01 vs. FFA
  group.'
