caption: UPR Signaling in TNBC. In TNBC cells, the IRE1α–XBP1s pathway can interact
  with HIF1α and c-MYC to participate in cell survival, angiogenesis, and invasion.
  Meanwhile, the PERK–eIF2α pathway activates either the peIF2α–ATF4 pathway or the
  transcription factor NRF2 to induce autophagy and redox control. The drugs targeting
  ERS-associated signaling pathways in TNBC are listed. Red represents pathway inhibitors
  and green represents pathway activators
