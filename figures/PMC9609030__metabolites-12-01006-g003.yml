caption: Metabolic precursors of UDP-GlcA synthesis are modified by UGT expression.
  Several metabolites of the pyrimidine, glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways
  are preferentially altered in UGT enzyme-expressing cells. Fold changes (FC) relative
  to control cells are provided in the heatmap. Non-significant metabolites are displayed
  in white. Note that glucose and pyruvate were supplemented by the medium. NCAsp,
  N-carbamoyl aspartate; DHO, dihydroorotate; UMP, uridine monophosphate; UDP, uridine-diphosphate;
  UTP, uridine triphosphate; Glc, glucose; Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Glc-1-P,
  glucose-1-phosphate; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose; UDP-GlcA, UDP-glucuronic acid; Fru, fructose;
  Fru-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; GlcN-6P, glucosamine-6-phosphate; GlcNAc-6-P, N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate;
  GlcNAc-1-P, N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate; UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine;
  Man-6-P, mannose-6-phosphate; Glc/Fru-1-6-BP, glucose/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
