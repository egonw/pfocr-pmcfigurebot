caption: (A) KEGG analysis confirmed the key pathways for selected 42 genes and ferroptosis
  ranked the top pathway, the genes were selected from publication based on Pubmed
  database, and ferroptosis was involved from KEGG analysis; (B) GO analysis revealed
  potential cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process
  (BP), the selected 42 genes were significantly correlated with iron ion homeostasis
  and peroxisomal membrane; (C) mRNA expression difference heatmap of 42 genes between
  CRC tumor and normal epithelium, the most significant 15 upregulated genes and 8
  downregulated genes were selected for further survival analsysi; (D) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis of OS for GPX4, NOX1, and ACSL4, results demonstrated that higher expression
  of NOX1, low expression of GPX4, and low expression of ACSL4 separately demonstrated
  better prognosis in CRC patients from TCGA. CRC, colorectal cancer; GO, Gene ontology;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; OS, overall survival
