figure_title: GXYLT1S212* activates the MAPK pathway to promote migration and invasion
  in CRC cells
caption: a GSEA analysis of TCGA dataset revealed the correlation between GXYLT1 expression
  and the MAPK pathway. b, c Western blot analysis of protein levels and phosphorylation
  levels of EGFR and ERK1/2 in transfected CRC cells. Bar graphs show quantification
  of pEGFR and pERK1/2 levels. d–f Exogenous GXYLT1 and GXYLT1S212* interact with
  EKR2. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed in cells transfected as indicated using
  Flag antibody to pull down Flag-GXYLT1 and Flag-GXYLT1S212* (d) or Myc antibody
  against Myc-ERK2 (e, f). Western blot was performed using the indicated antibodies.
  g, h Transwell migration and invasion assays of CRC cells expressing WT GXYLT1 or
  GXYLT1S212* and treated with the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 or the DMSO control
  for 48 h. Graphs show quantification of migrated cells. i, j Western blot analysis
  of cell lysates with the indicated antibodies. Bar graphs show quantification of
  pERK1/2 levels. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
