caption: CD40 signaling facilitates T cell recovery via a Mincle‐dependent pathway.
  (A, B) B6 recipients transplanted with BALB/c heart allografts were treated with
  mATG (days 0 and 4) with or without blocking anti‐CD154 mAb MR1 (day −1) or left
  untreated. The proportion of Mincle+, IL‐1β+, IL‐6+, or TNFα+ spleen B cells was
  determined by flow cytometry at day 12 after transplantation. The symbols represent
  individual animals; error bars represent SD. (C–E) Effect of agonistic anti‐CD40 mAb
  FGK4.5 treatment on T cell reconstitution in peripheral blood of allograft recipients
  treated with mATG. (C) B6.WT recipients of BALB/c heart allografts were treated
  with mATG alone (dotted line), mATG + depleting anti‐CD4 mAbs, or mATG + anti‐CD4 mAbs
  + FGK4.5. The p‐values are shown for the comparison between mATG + anti‐CD4 vs mATG
  + anti‐CD4 + FGK4.5 groups. (D, E) B6.Mincle−/− (D) or B6.Casp1−/− (E) recipients
  of BALB/c heart allografts were treated with mATG alone or in combination with FGK4.5.
  T cell reconstitution in B6.WT heart allograft recipients treated with mATG alone
  is shown for comparison (dotted line). n = 4–6 recipients/group; error bars represent
  SD. The p‐values are shown for comparisons between knockout recipients treated with
  mATG alone vs mATG + FGK4.5
