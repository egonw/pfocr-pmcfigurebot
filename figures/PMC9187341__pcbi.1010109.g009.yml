figure_title: miR-105 and miR-767 directly target genes in the PI3K pathway that mediate
  crosstalk with the MAPK pathway
caption: '(A) Mature miR-105 and miR-767 sequences are predicted to bind complementary
  sequences in the 3’-UTRs of FOXO3, IRS1, and PDK1. (B) A549 cells were treated with
  miR-105 and miR-767 mimics and ZSTK474. Gene expression was measured using qPCR
  and normalized to L7a. Each treatment condition included three replicates. ANOVA
  was performed. The p-values for the main effect of miRNA and ZSTK474 as well as
  their interaction are reported. (C) RNA immunoprecipitation measured binding between
  AGO2 protein and FOXO3, IRS1, PDK1 mRNA. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *Denotes
  a significant difference between Control and miR (p < 0.05). (D) Crosstalk between
  the PI3K and the MAPK pathways arises from AKT inhibition of RAF, IRS1 activation
  of RAS, and FOXO3-mediated transcription of RTKs. miR-105 and miR-767 overexpression
  resulted in direct binding to IRS1, PDK1, and FOXO3, and decreased levels of phosphorylated
  ERK. Blue: PI3K pathway proteins, green: MAPK pathway proteins, yellow P: activating
  phosphorylation, red P: inactivating phosphorylation.'
