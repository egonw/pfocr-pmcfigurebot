caption: Potential metabolic pathways affected based on altered metabolite levels
  in the current study. (A) Reduction in creatine levels may be due to renal parenchymal
  damage in Tsc1 KO mice. The reduction in creatine can directly affect the phosphagen
  pathway and energy storage in other tissues and indirectly affect the renal function.
  The synthesis of polyamines is not affected in Tsc1 KO mice. (B) The reduction in
  UDP-Galactose can adversely affect the Leloir pathway, altering the generation of
  glucose 1-phosphate and ultimately the production of myo-inositol. The reduced levels
  of UDP-galactose may also lead to problems with the post-translational glycosylation
  process. Metabolites that were shown to be significantly altered in the kidneys
  of Tsc1 KO mice are identified in red font.
