caption: 'LUSC classification pattern mediated by pyroptosis-related genes and relevant
  KEGG pathway enrichment. (A) The interaction of 41 pyroptosis regulators expressions
  in LUSC. The pyroptosis-related genes involving inflammasome pathways are shown
  on the left side of the circles. Yellow: canonical inflammasome pathway; Grey: non-canonical
  inflammasome pathway; Red: both inflammasome pathways. The lines represent the interaction
  of each pyroptosis gene and the size of the circles show the prognosis effect scaled
  by the P-value. Green: defensive factors for patient survival; Purple: risk factors
  for patients’ survival. (B) The consensus score matrix of all samples when k = 4
  in TCGA and GEO cohorts (GSE17710, GSE30219, GSE37745, GSE41271, and GSE73403).
  (C) Overall survival curves of the 4 pyroptosis clusters based on 833 patients with
  LUSC (Log-rank test, P = .005). (D) A heatmap was used to visualize the variant
  pyroptosis-related gene expression among distinct pyroptosis clusters. Clinicopathological
  information including age, sex, stage, and survival status is revealed in the above
  annotations. Red: high expression; blue: low expression. (E–J) These heatmaps showed
  the KEGG pathway differences analyzed by GSVA between every 2 pyroptosis-related
  clusters with Bayes moderation. (E) A vs B; (F) A vs C; (G) A vs D; (H) B vs C;
  (J) C vs D; (I) B vs D. Yellow embodied the high expression and green embodied the
  low expression. GEO = gene expression omnibus, GSVA = gene set variation analysis,
  KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, LUSC = lung squamous cell carcinoma,
  TCGA = The Cancer Genome Atlas.'
