caption: RB1 and pRB1 immunohistochemical expression in ovarian cancers. (A) RB1 protein
  expression in ovarian cancer (panel on the left side of figure shows negative RB1
  expression, and the panel on the right side shows moderate to strong RB1 expression).
  (B) Kaplan–Meier curve for RB1 nuclear expression and progression-free survival
  (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression). (C) Kaplan–Meier curve
  for RB1 nuclear expression and overall survival (blue line = low expression, green
  line = high expression). (D) pRB1 protein expression in ovarian cancer (panel on
  the left side of figure shows negative pRB1 expression, and the panel on the right
  side shows moderate to strong pRB1 expression). (E) Kaplan–Meier curve for pRB1
  nuclear expression and progression-free survival (blue line = low expression, green
  line = high expression). (F) Kaplan–Meier curve for pRB1 nuclear expression and
  overall survival (blue line = low expression, green line = high expression).
