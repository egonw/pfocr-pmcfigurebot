caption: α-Spectrin is mainly degraded in the RBCs after P. falciparum invasion. (A)
  Western blots of α-spectrin and β-spectrin in P. falciparum-iRBCs at different erythrocytic
  stages. R, T, and S indicate P. falciparum at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont
  stages, respectively. (B and C) Relative quantification of α-spectrin and β-spectrin
  protein levels obtained in panel A. (D and E) α-Spectrin and β-spectrin in iRBCs
  were detected via immunofluorescence staining. (F) The bubble chart represents the
  enrichment of Plasmodium proteins in KEGG pathways over 8-, 16-, 24-, 32-, 40-,
  and 48-h post-parasite invasion. The size of the circles indicates the number of
  proteins enriched in the signaling pathway, and the color of each circle indicates
  the enrichment score. The enrichment score was calculated by comparing the proteins’
  enrichment in iRBCs to that in the RBCs, with blue representing the lowest score
  and orange the highest score. (G) The heatmap represents the abundance of α-spectrin
  ubiquitinated sites in iRBCs over 8-, 16-, 24-, 32-, 40-, and 48-h post-parasite
  invasion. Only the lysine 2321 in α-spectrin was ubiquitinated in uninfected RBC,
  nine more lysine residues were ubiquitinated after parasite invasion. (H) The distribution
  of ubiquitinated lysine residues in α-spectrin of P. falciparum-iRBCs is graphically
  represented.
