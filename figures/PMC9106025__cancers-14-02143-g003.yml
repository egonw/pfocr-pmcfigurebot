caption: Pathway enrichment of transcripts and proteins informs cellular changes in
  response to challenge with S. aureus secretomes. Enrichment of biological pathways
  in keratinocytes based on the changes in genes (left panel) and proteins (right
  panel) was evaluated using the KEGG database. All differentially expressed pathways
  of significance (i.e., adj. p < 0.05) are shown and the direction of differential
  expression is indicated by colour of the box (blue = downregulated; red = upregulated).
  No significant pathways were found for SSA55 and SSA103 based on the proteomics
  data. Detailed pathway analysis results based on the Reactome database are available
  in .
