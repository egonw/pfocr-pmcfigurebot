caption: 'Left panel showing central vein: Adult control group showing hepatocyte
  cords radiating from the central vein with acidophilic cytoplasm and rounded nuclei.
  Aged untreated group showing an irregular arrangement of hepatocytes with vacuolated
  cytoplasm. Some cells show apoptotic changes with dark small nuclei. Aged-treated
  group showing hepatocyte-arranged cords with fewer apoptotic cells. H: hepatocytes,
  Head arrows: apoptotic bodies, CV: Central vein, Arrows: degenerated hepatocytes,
  DBS: dilated blood sinusoids and DCV: dilated central vein. Right panel showing
  portal vein: Adult control group showing normal hepatocytes with acidophilic cytoplasm
  and rounded nuclei around the portal tract composed of the portal vein, hepatic
  artery and bile duct. Aged untreated group showing an irregular arrangement of hepatocytes
  with marked vacuolization and hydropic degeneration. Areas of piecemeal necrosis
  and increased portal inflammatory infiltrate are seen. Some cells show apoptotic
  changes with dark small nuclei. Neocholagioles and areas of focal lytic necrosis
  are present. Aged-treated aged group showing hepatocytes and portal tract with fewer
  apoptotic cells and inflammatory infiltrate. Reduced areas of lytic necrosis and
  a portal tract-preserved structure are also observed. H: normal hepatocytes, Arrows:
  degenerated hepatocytes, Head arrows: apoptotic cells, PV: portal vein, A: hepatic
  artery, BD: bile duct, bold arrow: inflammatory infiltrate and tailed arrows: focal
  lytic necrotic areas.'
