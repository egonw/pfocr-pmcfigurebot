caption: Proposed model of how the NMDAR-ERK-CREB-signaling pathway leads to activation
  of the PRG PSD-95 through epigenetic mechanisms. In immature neurons, NR2B-NMDARs
  (important for neuronal plasticity) are enriched at the synapse via the interaction
  with the scaffold protein SAP102 (synapse-associated protein 102). Calcium influx
  through synaptic NR2B-NMDARs immediately activates CaMKII and RasGRF1 (coupled directly
  to the C-terminal tail of the NR2B subunit), which in turn induce the activation
  of ERK, MAPK and CREB (CREB-P). Activated CREB-P act as a transcription factor and
  recruits CBP, P300 and GCN5 to the PSD-95 gene promoter. Subsequently, these HATs
  promote the acetylation of K residues in the histone H3 tail (H3K9/14/27ac) to induce
  gene transcription (depicted under the PSD-95 gene). The produced PSD-95 proteins
  will be centrally inserted into the synapses and hold NR2A-NMDARs, displacing the
  previously synaptic SAP102-bound NR2B-rich receptors laterally to the extra-synaptic
  membrane. The synaptic NR2A-NMDARs are critical for neuronal refinement as well
  as for learning and memory.
