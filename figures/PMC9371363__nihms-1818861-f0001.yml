caption: Canonical pathways (marked in dashed green box) activated in response to
  type I and type II IL-4R signaling involve JAK/STAT-mediated phosphorylation of
  STAT6. Activation of the type 1 IL-4R also leads to activation of IRS-2 and downstream
  activation of PI3K, Akt and mTOR. Non-canonical activation (marked in red dashed
  box) of SRC, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in response to IL-4, or ERK1/2 and PI3K in response
  to IL-13, have also been described to contribute important biological outcomes.
  As activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR is directly attributable to γc/JAK3-driven phosphorylation
  of Y647 in IL-4Rα in the type 1 IL-4R complex, but IL-13Rα1/TYK2-driven phosphorylation
  of Y647 has not been described for the type II IL-4R, PI3K/AKT activation is considered
  canonical downstream of the type I IL-4R, but non-canonical downstream of the type
  II IL-4R complex. IL-13 can also signal through IL-13Rα2 (marked in dashed blue
  box) to activate/phosphorylate Akt/PKC and Ras/ERK1/2 pathway to induce TGFβ, Tenascin-c
  and other IL-13Rα2-associated genes.
