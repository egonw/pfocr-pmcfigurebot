caption: Periplocin induces apoptosis in both CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells. (a) Flow cytometry
  analysis of apoptosis in CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells treated with Periplocin (250 nM,
  125 nM) or an equal volume of DMEM media for 24 h. (b) Expression of cleaved-caspase3
  in CFPAC1 and PANC-1 cells following treatment with 250 nM, 125 nM periplocin, respectively.
  The data represent the mean ± SE, with ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 compared
  between two groups (n = 3).
