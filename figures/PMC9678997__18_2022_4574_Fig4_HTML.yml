caption: PD-linked LRRK2 mutations-induced deregulation of the TH–DA pathway in TG
  mice models. A–F G2019S LRRK2 mutation induces age-relevant alterations of TH and
  DA levels in transgenic mice midbrains. A–D Western blot data of TH protein levels
  in TG mice midbrains. A 3 months (3 mth), B 6 months (6mth), C 12 months (12 mth),
  D 20 months (20 mth). E Densitometric analysis of TH protein bands in Western blot
  gels in A–E. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with arbitrary value of TH bands of
  non-TG mice. F HPLC analysis of DA content in 7 days postnatal (P7) whole brain
  and 12 mth midbrain of mice. *P < 0.05, compared with DA content in non-TG mice
  brains. G–I Mutant R1441G LRRK2 induces age-relevant alterations of TH and DA levels
  in TG mice brains. G Representative Western blot TH bands in mice cortex. H Densitometric
  analysis of TH bands in Western blot gels in H. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with
  arbitrary value of TH bands in non-TG mice brains. I HPLC analysis of DA content
  in the striatum of 3 month- and 14 month-old mice. *, at least P < 0.05, compared
  with DA content in striatum of non-TG mice. J–L Age-dependent accumulation of DA-conjugated
  proteins in non-TG and TG mice midbrains. J 12 months, K 18 months, L, 21 months
