figure_title: IL-1β and downstream target, CCL2, are differentially regulated by NMN
  in aged kidneys and livers
caption: 'mRNA expression levels by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
  (qRT-PCR) in all figures are from untreated 6-month-old mice or from 26-month-old
  mice either untreated, or treated with: Elamipretide (ELAM), Nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) or ELAM+NMN. Target gene expression is first normalized to housekeeping gene,
  Bactn, and fold changes are shown relative to the average of young untreated mice.
  Error = +/−SEM; p-values by 2-way ANOVA with Tukey multivariable testing; sample
  size (n) indicated with circle symbol for each treatment group. a&b. mRNA expression
  of senescence-associated inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) in (a)
  kidney. NMN-treated aged animals had statistically significant increase in Il1b
  kidney expression levels compared to all other groups. Additionally, Il1b is significantly
  lower in ELAM+NMN treated kidney compared to NMN-treated kidneys. (b) qRT-PCR of
  Il1b in the liver. c&d. mRNA expression of gene targets, Cdkn2a (p16), Cdkn1a (p21),
  Tp53 (p53) which are known senescence-associated cell cycle regulators in (c) the
  kidney. (d) the liver. e&f. mRNA expression of senescence-associated biomarker,
  Lmnb1 (Laminin beta-1), in (e) the kidney and (f) in the liver. g. mRNA expression
  of Bcl3 (B-cell Lymphoma C) in the liver. h. Schematic outlining the mechanism in
  which IL-1β downstream targets, Ccl2 and Cxcl10 may trigger pro-inflammatory pathway
  and macrophage recruitment leading to further kidney injury. i&j. qRT-PCR panel
  of mRNA expression for IL-1β downstream targets, Ccl2 and Cxcl10, in (i) the kidney
  and (j) the liver. Representative images for RNA In-Situ Hybridization (RNA-ISH)
  captured at 20x-40x magnification. Red punctate dots signal areas of expression
  of associated gene. k. Representative images of RNA In-Situ Hybridization (RNA-ISH)
  of IL-1β. l. qRT-PCR panel of mRNA levels of Kim-1 in the kidney. m. Representative
  images of RNA In-Situ Hybridization (RNA-ISH) of Kim-1, (Kidney Injury Marker-1,
  KIM1), and Lcn2 (Lipocalin-2/Ngal), a secretory protein associated with inflammatory
  response.'
