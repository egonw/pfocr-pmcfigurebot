caption: 'Schematic diagram of the plant–pathogen interaction pathway involving DEGs
  in the addition line II-9-3. Red boxes: proteins encoded by genes of A. cristatum;
  green boxes: proteins encoded by genes of wheat. Genes from A. cristatum encoding
  these enzymes as well as their expression are presented in the heatmap.'
