caption: Amentoflavone inactivates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via the miR-16/HMGA2
  axis. (A) WB validation of β-catenin protein expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells
  treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with inhibitor-NC or
  miR-16 inhibitor. (B) The TOP/FOP ratio of HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone
  (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with inhibitor-NC or miR-16 inhibitor. (C) qPCR
  validation of genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway protein expression in HCT116
  and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with
  inhibitor-NC or miR-16 inhibitor. (D) WB validation of β-catenin protein expression
  in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected
  with LV-NC or LV-HMGA2. (E) qPCR validation of genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway protein expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone
  (5 µm) or vehicle and transfected with LV-NC or LV-HMGA2. (F) qPCR validation of
  genes related to the EMT in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with amentoflavone (5
  µm) or vehicle and transfected with LV-NC or LV-HMGA2. (B,C,E,F) N=3, mean ± SEM,
  *P<0.05, by Student’s t-test. Data represents similar results from 3 independent
  experiments. WB, western blotting; NC, negative control; qPCR, quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction; SEM, structural equation modeling; MT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
