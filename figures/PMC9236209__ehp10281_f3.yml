caption: 'The effects of PFOS on the liver metabolic profiles of male and female mice.
  PLS-DA score plots for discriminating the metabolome in the livers of male (A) and
  female (B) mice from control and PFOS treatment groups. Volcano plots showing the
  relative abundances of metabolites in male (C) and female (D) mice ( dosage). Enrichment
  analysis of differential metabolites in male (E) and female (F) mice. Rank pathway
  term analysis of differentially expressed metabolites in male (G) and female (H)
  mice. Comparison of host concentrations of arginine (I) and proline (J) in livers
  by LC-MS/MS in the indicated groups. The relative abundance was calculated by the
  ratio between the level of metabolite in PFOS-exposed group and the average level
  of control group. . Horizontal lines in I and J represent the mean. Summary data
  can be found in Table S4 and Excel Tables S3 and S4. Statistical significance was
  analyzed by one-way ANOVA among multiple groups. Note: ANOVA, analysis of variance;
  F, female; F1–F4, control, , , and ; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography–tandem mass
  spectrometry; M, male mice; M1–M4, control, , , and ; PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonate;
  PLS-DA, partial least squares discrimination analysis. *. **. *** in comparison
  with the control group.'
