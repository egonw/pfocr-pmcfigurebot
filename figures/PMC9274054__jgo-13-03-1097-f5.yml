caption: 'TRIM52 is present as a factor that promotes NF-κB activation. NC: HCT116
  cells transfected with negative control. siR-TRIM52 002: cell line transfected with
  TRIM52 gene off SiRNA 002. siR-TRIM52 003: cell line transfected with TRIM52 gene
  off SiRNA 003. Vector: SW620 cells transfected with pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-TRIM52: Cell
  line transfected with TRIM52/pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-puro as control. ****,
  P<0.0001. (A) HCT116 cells were transfected with SiR-TRIM52 002, SiR-TRIM52 003,
  NC control, and SW620 after transfection with empty vector and TRIM52 overexpression
  plasmid. Total cellular proteins were extracted to verify NF-κB-related signaling
  pathway proteins by WB. (B) After HCT116 cells were transfected with SiR-TRIM52
  002, SiR-TRIM52 003, NC control, SW620 transfected with empty vector and TRIM52
  overexpression plasmid, proteins were extracted from cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively,
  and changes in NF-κB P65 were verified by WB. WB, Western blot.'
