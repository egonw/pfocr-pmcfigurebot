caption: The Dual Role Of Nbs1 in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)‐medulloblastoma (MB). In cancer
  prone SmoA1‐Granule Cell Progenitors (GCPs), Nbn KO causes reduced proliferation
  and increased cell death, ultimately leading to inhibition of MB development due
  to activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and impairment of the SHH pathway.
  Whether these two events are linked or fully independent is currently not known.
  On the other hand, Nbn hemizygosis (Nbn HZ) causes DDR activation and a Notch‐dependent
  increase in clonogenic capability, favouring GCP transformation. These results,
  collectively, indicate a gene dosage‐dependent function of Nbn in SHH‐driven tumorigenesis.
article_title: A gene dosage‐dependent effect unveils NBS1 as both a haploinsufficient
  tumour suppressor and an essential gene for SHH‐medulloblastoma.
