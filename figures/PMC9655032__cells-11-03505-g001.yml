caption: 'Renal fibrosis models established by UUO. (A) Histomorphology (including
  H&E and Masson staining) of the kidneys in both groups (scale bar: 100 μm). (B–G)
  Analysis of E-cadherin, Vimentin, α-SMA, Collagen I, and Fibronectin relative protein
  levels by Western blot in both groups. (H,I) Levels of biochemical parameters (Scr
