caption: Piezo1 co-localizes with Cx43 HCs on osteocyte cell surface and activates
  Cx43 HCs through PI3K-Akt pathway. A Western blot analysis of p-Akt and Akt protein
  level form whole lysates of MLO-Y4 cells treated with 20 μM Yoda1 for 10, 20, and
  30 min. B Quantification of p-Akt/Akt in A, n = 3; C EtBr dye uptake level of MLO-Y4
  cells pre-incubated with 20 μM LY294002, followed treatment with 20 μM Yoda1. n = 3.
  D Representative images out of three independent experiments of cell surface staining
  on MLO-Y4 cells under control or treated with 20 μM Yoda1 or FFSS (16 dynes/cm2)
  stimulation. (Red for Cx43 and green signal for Piezo1). E Mander’s coefficients
  of Cx43(E2) over Piezo1. Data are shown as mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
  Statistical analysis was performed using One-way ANOVA for multiple comparison analysis
