caption: 'The Notch signaling pathway in ISC regulation. The Notch signaling receptor
  is a single transmembrane protein with functional extracellular (NECD), transmembrane
  (TM) and intracellular (NICD) structural domains. Delta and Senate families are
  ligands for Notch. First, the Notch receptor is sheared and glycosylated within
  the Golgi of the recipient cell, followed by S1 cleavage with TM-NICD. Endosomes
  transfer processed receptors to the plasma membrane, where it binds to the ligand
  via Deltex regulation and NUMB inhibition. Secondly, TACE (TNF-ADAM: metalloproteinase
  convertase) shears NECD away from the TM-NICD structural domain when it binds to
  the ligand (S2 cleavage). Lastly, NECD-linked ligands form a complex. In signal-receiving
  cells, NICD is released from the TM by-secretase (S3 cleavage), resulting in nuclear
  translocation, binding to the CSL transcription factor complex and allowing transcription
  of traditional Notch target genes.'
