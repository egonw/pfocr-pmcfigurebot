caption: 'MiR-25-3p blocks the NOX4/NF-κB signalling pathway in LPS-treated H9C2 cells.
  (a) The WT binding site of NOX4 with miR-25-3p was predicted by miRDB and relevant
  mutant (MUT) sequence. (b) The target relationship between NOX4 and miR-25-3p was
  validated by luciferase reporter assay. (c) The protein levels of NOX4 and p-NF-κB
  p65/NF-κB p65 were measured by western blot. ∗∗P < 0.01versus control. ##P < 0.01versus
  LPS blank.'
