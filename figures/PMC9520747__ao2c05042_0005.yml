caption: Results of the investigation aimed at identifying the intracellular signaling
  pathway involved in the knockdown of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) by compound 8.
  Cells were treated with compound 8 or talaporfin sodium for 1 h and then washed
  with phosphate-buffered saline; they were then irradiated with light at the indicated
  wavelengths. The cells were lysed at 4 °C by sonication; the sample was then electrophoresed
  on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
  membranes. The samples thus obtained were immunoblotted with anti-EGFR, anti-ERK1/2,
  anti-phospho-ERK (Tyr204), anti-GLUT1, anti-α-tubulin, and anti-PCNA antibodies.
