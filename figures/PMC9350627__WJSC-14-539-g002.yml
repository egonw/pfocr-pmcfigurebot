caption: 'miR-3682-3p promotes the stem cell properties of hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells via the PI3K/AKT/c-Myc signaling pathway. A: Representative images of formed
  hepatospheres (× 100 magnification); scale bar: 200 μm; B: Flow cytometric analysis
  of the proportion of side population cells; C: Immunofluorescence staining was performed
  to assess the expression levels of CD44 and CD133 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
  (scale bar: 5 μm); D and E: RT-qPCR analysis of SOX2, OCT4, CD133, and CD44 expression;
  F: Gene set enrichment analysis showing that miR-3682-3p regulates the PI3K/AKT
  signaling axis; G: Western blotting analysis of PI3K/AKT/c-Myc signaling- and stemness-related
  protein expression levels. bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001. Experiments were repeated three
  times. NC: Negative control.'
article_title: miR-3682-3p directly targets FOXO3 and stimulates tumor stemness in
  hepatocellular carcinoma via a positive feedback loop involving FOXO3/PI3K/AKT/c-Myc.
