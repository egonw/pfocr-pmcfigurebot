caption: Targeting the MUC1-C extracellular and cytoplasmic domains for disruption
  of auto-inductive nodes and elimination of CSCs. (A). Antibody 3D1 generated against
  the MUC1-C/ED alpha-3 helix has been developed for (i) allogeneic CAR T cells that
  are under clinical evaluation, and (ii) ADCs that are being advanced with IND-enabling
  studies by the NCI NExT Program. MUC1-C forms complexes with EGFR at the cell membrane
  that are mediated by galectin-3 []. In this way, MUC1-C contributes to EGFR activation
  and resistance to EGFR inhibitors []. Antibodies generated against the alpha-4 helix
  are being developed to block the MUC1-C/ED interaction with galectin-3 and thereby
  inhibit constitutive MUC1-C-driven RTK activation. (B). The MUC1-C/CD CQC motif
  is necessary for MUC1-C homodimerization and function as an oncoprotein. Targeting
  the MUC1-C CQCRRKN region with the GO-203 inhibitor blocks interactions with TCF4
  [], TAK1 [] and JAK1 []. GO-203 treatment also inhibits the interactions of MUC1-C
  with STAT3 [] and NF-κB []. As a result, targeting the MUC1-C CQC motif disrupts
  auto-induction of MUC1-C NODES 1–3. Ongoing work is addressing another MUC1-C node
  that may be of importance for RTK→RAS signaling in cancer. In this regard, MUC1-C
  forms complexes with effectors of the RTK→RAS pathway that include PI3K [], SHC,
  PLCγ and GRB2/SOS [].
