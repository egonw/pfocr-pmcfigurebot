caption: A visual schematic and the timing diagrams for the 13C direct-detect experiments
  used to observe methyllysine. (A) A schematic of the magnetization transfer pathway
  is shown on monomethyllysine. The carbon-start [13Cali,15N]-CAliN-Kme is shown in
  black arrows. The initial INEPT transfer step between methyl proton and carbon in
  the methyl proton-start [13Cali,15N]-CAliN-Kme is displayed as a red arrow. (B)
  Pulse sequence for the carbon-start [13Cali,15N]-CAliN-Kme experiment. The delay
  times are Δ = 9.8 ms, Δ1 = 25 ms, and ε = t1(0) + pC180. The phase cycle is φ1 =
  x,−x; φ2 = x,x,−x,−x; φ3 = 4(x),4(−x); φREC = x,− x, x, −x, −x, x, −x, x. (C) Pulse
  sequence for the methyl proton-start [13Cali,15N]-CAliN-Kme experiment. The delay
  times are δ = 1.44 ms, Δ = 9.8 ms, and ε = t1(0) + pC180. The phase cycle is φ1
  = x,−x; φ2 = 8(x),8(−x); φ3 = x,x,−x,−x; φ4 = 4(x),4(−x); φREC = x,− x, −x, x, −x,
  x, x, −x. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimension is obtained by States-TPPI
  incrementation of φ3. For both pulse sequences, narrow and wide rectangular pulses
  correspond to 90° and 180° hard pulses, respectively. All 13C pulses are represented
  with narrow (90°, Q5_sebop) shapes and wide (180°, Q3_surbop) shapes. The gray pulse
  on 13C indicates a band-selective 13Cʹ and 13Cali inversion pulse. The ‘TR’ label
  indicates a time-reversed 90° pulse. All pulses are applied with x-phase unless
  otherwise indicated. Pulsed field gradients (Gz) are also represented by shapes.
  Nitrogen decoupling is achieved with garp4 (220 μs, 2.367 W), and proton decoupling
  is achieved using waltz65 (70 μs, 0.096 W). 15N chemical shift evolution is measured
  during t1, with quadrature achieved by States-TPPI incrementation of φ3. In the
  1D variant, t1 is held constant at the time of the first increment (3 μs) and is
  not collected as a variable delay. in both experiments, the carrier position is
  set to 13Cali, centered at 33 ppm. In the 1D variant of each pulse sequence, t1
  is held constant at the time of the first increment (3 μs) and is not collected
  as a variable delay.
