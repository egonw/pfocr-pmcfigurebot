caption: Mahesh et al. established a novel methodology toward substituted benzimidazoles
  from anilines, aldehydes, and TMSN3. The one-pot, multicomponent reaction proceeds
  smoothly to afford products in modest to good yields with broad substrate scope
  (). A reaction pathway was also described.
