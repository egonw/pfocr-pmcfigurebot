caption: The expression of MYPT1 is downregulated in ccRCC tissues and linked to aggressive
  disease progression and a poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. (A) Overall view of
  MYPT1 immunostaining in 180 kidney samples of the TMA (150 ccRCC tissues and 30
  normal kidney tissues). (B–D) Immunostaining of MYPT1 protein in normal kidney tissues,
  low Fuhrman grade (I/II) tumour tissues and high Fuhrman grade (III/IV) tumour tissues.
  (E) The histogram indicates the IHC scores of MYPT1 expression in normal and tumour
  tissues. (F) Kaplan–Meier curve for OS between the high MYPT1 expression group and
  the low MYPT expression group according to MYPT1 IHC scores (8 ~ 12, high MYPT1
  expression, n = 55 vs. 0 ~ 6, low MYPT1 expression, n = 95). (G) The histogram indicates
  the IHC scores of MYPT1 expression in two groups stratified by Furman grade. (H)
  Kaplan–Meier curve for OS between the MYPT1 low and high expression groups of TCGA‐KIRC
  patients stratified by the median of MYPT1 expression level. Data presented as mean ± SEM
  (n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed with a two‐tailed unpaired Student's
  t test (NS, P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). ccRCC, renal clear cell
  carcinoma; IHC, immunohistochemistry; MYPT1, myosin phosphatase target subunit 1;
  TMA, tissue microarray.
