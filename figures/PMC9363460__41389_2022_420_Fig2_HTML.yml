figure_title: Schematic representation of key steps of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway
  leading to sterol and non-sterol isoprenoid synthesis
caption: MVA is produced from acetyl-CoA, through reactions that are catalyzed by
  the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Thiolase), HMG-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) and HMGCR enzymes.
  MVA is converted into farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP), which with the geranylgeranyl-PP
  are responsible of protein prenylation. FPP molecules can also be condensed by the
  squalene synthase (SQS) to produce squalene. Then, squalene is oxidized and cyclized
  to lanosterol by the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) and lanosterol synthase (LSS), respectively.
  Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol by 19 oxygen-based reactions through
  the Kandutsch-Russell or the Bloch pathway. De novo synthetized cholesterol and
  diet-derived cholesterol taken up through the LDL receptor (LDLR)-mediated endocytosis
  can give rise to cholesteryl esters, hydroxycholesterol (HC) or steroid hormones.
