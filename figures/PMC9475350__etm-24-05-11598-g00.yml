caption: 'SIRT3 overexpression mitigates microglia-mediated cytotoxicity in DACs.
  DACs were incubated with SIRT3 adenoviral vector or non-targeting empty vector,
  then co-cultured with activated-microglia for 48 h. The microglia were stimulated
  with 1 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide. (A) The mRNA expression levels of SIRT3 and SOD2
  in DACs were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B) The protein
  expression of SIRT3 and SOD2 in DACs was determined using western blotting. (C)
  The fluorescent probe dihydroethidium was used to detect intracellular superoxide
  anion levels, and a hydrogen peroxide assay kit was used to detect intracellular
  hydrogen peroxide levels in DACs. (D) Cell apoptosis rate and (E) cell cycle distribution
  of DACs were measured using flow cytometry. (F) The fluorescence probe JC-1 was
  used to detect the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Scale bar, 100 µm.
  (G) Mitochondrial calcein-AM green fluorescence intensity was examined using flow
  cytometry to evaluate the number of the membrane permeability transport pores opening
  in DACs. MitoTracker (red) staining indicates the localization of mitochondria.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. (H) Western blotting was performed to detect the protein levels
  of mitochondrial cyclophilin D in DACs. Data in A, B, C, F, G and H are shown as
  fold change over the Control group. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. n=4. *P<0.05
  vs. Control; #P<0.05 vs. Vector. SIRT3, sirtuin 3; DAC, dopaminergic neuronal cell;
  SOD2, superoxide dismutase 2; JC-1, tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide.'
