caption: PDIA4 promoted tumorigenesis and RT resistance by binding and protecting
  TAX1BP1 against protein degradation. A PDIA4 can bind TAX1BP1 with a high binding
  fraction as determined by IP/MS analysis. B Co-IP experiments demonstrated that
  PDIA4 immunoprecipitated with anti-TAX1BP1 antibody, and TAX1BP1 immunoprecipitated
  with anti-PDIA4 antibody. C Immunofluorescence was conducted to examine the expression
  and localization of PDIA4 and TAX1BP1, the results showed that PDIA4 and TAX1BP1
  was localized mainly in the cytoplasm of TNBC cells and cancer specimens. D Western
  blot analysis of TAX1BP1 expression levels in TNBC cells with PDIA4 knockdown or
  overexpression. E Western blot analysis of TAX1BP1 expression levels in TNBC cells
  treated with CHX for the indicated times. F MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
  treated with/without MG132, and TAX1BP1 protein levels were detected by western
  blot
