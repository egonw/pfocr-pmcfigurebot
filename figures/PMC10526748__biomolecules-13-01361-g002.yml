caption: TAAR expression in different intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (GSE119937).
  (a) Voom-normalized TAAR expression levels in basal-like (basal, n = 39), HER2-positive
  (Her2, n = 32), luminal A (LumA, n = 20), luminal B (LumB, n = 19), and normal-like
  (Norm, n = 8) breast tumors (GSE119937, tumors were classified via PAM50 signature
  and genefu R package); *—p < 0.05, **—p < 0.01, ***—p < 0.001; mean expression values
  are marked by triangle; (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of top 1000 genes,
  co-expressed with TAARs in different intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.
