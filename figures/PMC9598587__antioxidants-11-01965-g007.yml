caption: Proposed endocytosis pathway of Tf-SeNPs in MCF-7 cells (A). Quantitative
  analysis of cellular uptake efficacy of coumarin-6-loaded Tf-SeNPs in MCF-7 cells
  (B) and HUVEC cells (C). TfR expression in A375, HepG2, MCF-7, and HUVEC cells (D).
  Free Tf competed with coumarin-6-loaded Tf-SeNPs for binding to TfRs on MCF-7 cells
  (E). Intracellular trafficking of coumarin-6-loaded Tf-SeNPs (F). Intracellular
  uptake of Tf-SeNPs in MCF-7 cells under different endocytosis-inhibited conditions.
  Difference with p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**) was considered statistically significant
  as compared to the control group (G). In vitro release profiles of DOX from Tf-SeNPs
  in PBS solution (pH 7.4 and pH 5.3) (H) [].
