caption: Biological function analysis of hub genes that were upregulated in the INMT
  low-expression group of TCGA-LUAD cohort. (A) Protein–protein interaction (PPI)
  network of upregulated genes in the INMT low-expression group constructed based
  on the STRING database. (B) Top 10 hub genes identified using the MCC method in
  the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. (C) Chord plot for the correlation of INMT and
  its hub genes. (D) Pathway activity analysis of hub genes. Pathway activation (red)
  represents the percentage of cancers in which pathways may be activated by given
  genes, and inhibition in a similar way showed as pathway inhibition (blue). (E)
  Interaction map of hub genes and pathway conducted. A solid line indicates that
  the hub gene activates the pathway, and a dashed line indicates that the hub gene
  inhibits the pathway. (F) Survival difference between the high and low expression
  of hub genes. (G) Correlation between the expression of hub genes and CTRP drug
  sensitivity. The analyses of  were performed online in GSCALite. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  PPI, protein–protein interaction.
