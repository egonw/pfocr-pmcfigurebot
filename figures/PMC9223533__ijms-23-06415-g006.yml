caption: 'Linking pathway demonstration of phosphotransferase (PTS), galactose metabolism,
  and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in 12dwb. Bacterial biofilm can uptake sugars by
  specific sugar transport systems (e.g., PTS) and non-PTS systems (e.g., galactose
  metabolism). LacAE is involved in the metabolism of sugar molecules via fructose
  6-phosphate which is also linked with glycolysis and synthesis of cell-wall components.
  In addition, peptidoglycan biosynthesis proteins (e.g., femX) are also directly
  linked with cell-wall formation. EII: Enzyme II; Red names denote encoded genes
  with increased abundance in 12dwb.'
