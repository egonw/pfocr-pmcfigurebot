caption: 'Summary of the proposed mechanism for statin inhibition of host cell invasion
  by Staphylococcus aureus, a leading etiologic agent in infection of cardiac and
  prosthetic device infections. (A): Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA)-reductase at the early, rate-limiting step of the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway, decreasing cholesterol levels as well as decreasing the formation of intermediates
  within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. (B): Infection by S. aureus in the
  absence of statins (Step #1) proceeds through fibronectin-binding proteins expressed
  on the cell surface of invasive strains, engaging host fibronectin at the host alpha5/beta1
  integrin receptor (#2) []. Engagement stimulates CDC42 activation [] at the host
  cell membrane where CDC42 is anchored via long, hydrophobic prenyl groups []. Activated
  CDC42 couples to membrane-localized phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), initiating
  cell signaling cascades that include PI3K phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 1,2-bisphosphate
  (#3) [], potentially dislodging alpha-actinin from actin stress fibers [] and stimulating
  endocytic uptake of the bacterial/fibronectin/receptor complex []. This uptake provides
  invasive strains with an intracellular niche for entering dormancy [,] or for active
  replication that leads to host cell lysis and reinfection of adjacent cells [].
  Infected immune cells serve as a “Trojan Horse” for the transport and establishment
  of secondary infection at distal sites [] such as cardiac devices and hip and knee
  replacements. In the presence of statins (#4) that inhibit the early, rate-limiting
  step of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [], long, hydrophobic prenyl intermediates
  become less abundant for membrane anchoring of CaaX-domain-containing proteins,
  including the small GTPase CDC42 []. Sequestration of CDC42 within the cytosol decreases
  access to downstream mediators, including PI3K (#5). Intracellular infection decreases
  in part through decreased fibronectin binding at the host cell membrane [], decreased
  integrin receptor complex formation [], and decreased actin reorganization [].'
