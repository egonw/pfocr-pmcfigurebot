caption: 'Network and pathway analysis for rods, cones, and Müller glia cells. Data
  showing differentially enriched genes (DEGs) in rd1 retinal cell types, compared
  to wild-type (WT). (a) Network and pathways changes in rod photoreceptors at post-natal
  day (P)13, i.e., at the peak of rod degeneration. Left panel: Volcano plot of all
  genes significantly regulated in rd1 rods (|avg_log2FC| > 0.58). Blue dots for downregulated
  genes, red dots for upregulated genes, grey indicates no significant change between
  rd1 and WT. Top right: Gene ontology (GO) biological category (BP) analysis of DEGs
  showing top 10 most enriched GO BP terms. The number of DEGs for each GO term are
  indicated on the right. Bottom right: KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs showing top
  10 enriched terms. (b) Network and pathways changes in cone photoreceptors at P17,
  i.e., at the start of cone degeneration. Left panel: Volcano plot of all genes significantly
  regulated in rd1 cones. Blue dots for down-regulated genes, red dots for upregulated
  genes, grey indicates no significant change between rd1 and WT. Top right: Gene
  ontology (GO) biological category (BP) analysis of DEGs showing top 10 most enriched
  GO BP terms. The number of DEGs for each GO term are indicated on the right. Bottom
  right: KEGG pathway analysis showing top 10 enriched terms. (c) Pathways analysis
  on Müller cells at P13. Left: Top 10 enriched pathways in gene ontology biological
  process analysis. Right: KEGG pathway analysis showing top 10 enriched terms.'
