caption: Effect of Rg1 on oxidative stress and nuclear damage in Sca-1+ HSC/HPCs.
  (a, b) The production of ROS by laser scanning confocal microscope assess, Bar = 10 μm.
  (c, d) The expression and location of γ-H2AX which is an important marker for the
  formation of DNA damage foci; green fluorescence areas show the expression and location
  of γ-H2AX, Bar = 10 μm. (e–g) The content of SOD, MDA, and CAT.  ∗P < 0.05 as compared
  with control group; aP < 0.05 as compared with the LiCl group.
