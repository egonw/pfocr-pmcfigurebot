figure_title: Scu induces HIF1a ubiquitin-mediated degradation in HCC cells under
  hypoxia
caption: A Heatmap of the metabolites involved in glycolysis in HepG2 cells after
  treatment with 10 μM Scu determined by LC‒MS. n = 3. B Detection of the phenotypic
  transformation of energy metabolism in HepG2 cells after treatment with Scu by a
  Seahorse energy metabolic instrument. n = 5. C RNA-seq analysis of HIF1a target
  gene expression in HepG2 cells after Scu treatment. Genes marked in red are genes
  related to glycolysis. D GSEA results demonstrated downregulation of the glycolytic
  signaling pathway following Scu treatment in HepG2 cells. E The relative mRNA levels
  of the indicated genes in HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated with Scu. n = 3. F, G The
  expression levels of the indicated proteins in HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated with
  Scu. n = 3. H The expression of HIF1a and OH-HIF1a in HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated
  with 10 μM Scu and 400 μM α-KG. n = 3. I Immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin and VHL
  with HIF1a in HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated with 10 μM Scu and 400 μM α-KG. n = 3.
  J, K Immunofluorescence staining of HIF1a and OH-HIF1a proteins in HepG2 and Huh7
  cells treated with 10 μM Scu. Arrows indicate that fluorescent signals are located
  in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Scale bars, 25 μm. The data are mean ± SD; *P < 0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared to the control group.
