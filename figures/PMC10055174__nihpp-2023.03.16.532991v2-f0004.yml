figure_title: Evolution of mutations in HLA-DQB1 molecule
caption: (A) Somatic mutations in single molecules of HLA-DQB1 NM_002123. The position
  of mutation is indicated at the bottom of the graph. The mutation is numerically
  numbered from C-terminus to N-terminus. The numbers of cells expressing these mutation
  isoforms from each cluster (indicated at the top) or sample of origin (indicated
  at the bottom) are shown in the right panel. Close circle-mutation codon; Open circle-wild
  type codon. Open rectangle-double single-nucleotide mutation in the same codon.
  (B) Pathway flow chart of mutation accumulation in single molecules of HLA-DQB1.
  The area of the circle is proportional to the accumulated number of mutations in
  a molecule. The scale on the left indicates the number of mutations in a single
  molecule but is not mathematically scaled. The arrow indicates the potential pathways
  of mutation accumulation in these molecules. The number of white text indicates
  specific mutation(s) in a molecule. The number of red text indicates the number
  of cells expressing the mutation(s).
