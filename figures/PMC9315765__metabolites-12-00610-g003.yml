caption: Dysregulated metabolites between T2DM and T2DM(+) HCC patients identified
  in metabolic profiling. (A) Hierarchical clustering showing the dysregulated metabolites
  between T2DM and T2DM(+) HCC patients. Each column represents a sample, and each
  row represents a metabolite. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis of dysregulated metabolites
  identified in the T2DM(+) HCC group versus the T2DM group. (C) The volcano plot
  depicts the difference of metabolites between T2DM and T2DM(+) HCC patients. A dot
  represents a metabolite. D refers to T2DM patients, and HD refers to T2DM(+) HCC
  patients. T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; HCC, hepatocellular cancer.
