caption: Gene Ontology and Hallmark GSVA. Heatmap of the GSVA enrichment score per
  sample from AML samples. All gene sets pass a p-value threshold of 0.05 unless otherwise
  noted with NS based on a DE analysis. Gene sets were manually annotated with a category.
  n = 636. (A) Upper and lower 10% of samples by OGT expression. (B) Upper and lower
  10% of samples by OGA expression.

  biosynthetic pathway and O-GlcNAcylation in acute myeloid leukemia blasts and stem
  cells.
