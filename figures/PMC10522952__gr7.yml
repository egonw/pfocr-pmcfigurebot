caption: Knockdown of SIRT1 reverses the effect of IB-exos on ER stress response.
  A. Immunofluorescence staining showing that knockdown of SIRT1 increased the expression
  levels of GRP78 and CHOP that were inhibited by IB-exos in LPS-treated HUVECs. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. B. Western blotting showing that knockdown of SIRT1 enhanced the phosphorylation
  of ERK that was reduced by IB-exos in LPS-treated HUVECs. Data was presented as
  means ± SD from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed
  using one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

  septic endoplasmic reticulum stress via regulating SIRT1/ERK pathway.
