caption: Interaction of sebaceous gland-expressed neuropeptides and sexual hormones.
  Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) – after binding the corticotropin-releasing
  hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) -stimulates sebaceous lipogenesis and testosterone release,
  while testosterone inhibits the expression of CRHR1. Green symbols and arrows indicate
  anti-inflammatory activity; red symbols and arrows indicate inflammatory potential.
  Double lines on the arrows indicate inhibition. Blue symbols indicate targets of
  the pathway, whereas testosterone might induce a negative feedback to CRH by inhibiting
  the expression levels of its receptor CRHR1. ø, CRH does probably not inhibit IL1.
  3βHSD1, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogensase 1; αMSH, α-melanocortin-stimulating hormone;
  IL1RA, Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist; NGF, neural growth factor.
