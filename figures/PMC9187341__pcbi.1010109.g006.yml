figure_title: miR-105 and miR-767 target genes in the PI3K-AKT pathway
caption: (A) KEGG pathway analysis was performed on the top 1,000 predicted gene targets
  of miR-105 and miR-767. False discovery rate corrected p-values are reported. (B)
  miR-105 and miR-767 were overexpressed in HepG2 cells. qPCR was used to measure
  expression of genes that were putative targets of both miR-105 and miR-767 and/or
  played a crucial role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. *p < 0.05. (C) The heat
  map shows correlations between miR-105/767 expression and drug IC50 values. Blue
  represents negative values while red denotes positive values. The top 15 drugs with
  the most negative correlation between miRNA and IC50 represent drugs that are most
  effective at killing high miR-105 and miR-767-expressing cell lines. Drug names
  are reported on the left and their putative protein targets are given on the right.

  bimodal miRNA in patient survival and drug responses to PI3K inhibitors.
