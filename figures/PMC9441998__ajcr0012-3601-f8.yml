caption: The effect of the combination treatment of cordycepin and radiation in mouse
  Leydig tumor cells. The combination treatment of cordycepin and radiation has a
  synergistic effect could significantly suppress cell viability and enhance the radiosensitivity
  in MA-10 cells. In addition, cordycepin and radiation could significantly induce
  sub-G1 and G2/M phase arrest in MA-10 cells. Moreover, the combination treatment
  of cordycepin and radiation induces MA-10 cells to progress toward apoptosis in
  vitro and in vivo.
