caption: 'Mechanisms of cancer cells resistance to targeted therapy. Explanatory notes:
  Resistance to targeted therapy often results from reactivation of pathways inhibited
  by the drug (acquisition of drug-resistant mutations/amplification of the target,
  re-activation of downstream signalling proteins via activation mechanisms or activating
  mutations, or activation of compensatory signalling pathways) []. Due to commonly
  observed gene mutations, cancer cells can perform modifications as a response to
  targeted molecules and thus induce resistance to specific agents []. The mutation,
  amplification, downregulation, and alternative RNA splicing of drug targets all
  contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to targeted therapy []. Moreover, direct
  restoration of biologic function that was disrupted by a drug [], activation of
  compensatory pathways parallel to or downstream of the inhibited pathway (such as
  pro-angiogenic signalling through PDGFR), activation of pro-survival signalling,
  and epigenetic alterations (like DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA)
  also contribute to resistance to targeted treatment []'
