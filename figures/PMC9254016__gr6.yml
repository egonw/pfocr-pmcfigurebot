caption: 'Gene set enrichment analysis of shared drugs between autoimmune diseases
  and cancer(A–H) GSEA of expression profile of methotrexate (A) and azathioprine
  (B) show that both methotrexate and azathioprine have extensive effects on gene
  signatures of ADs and cancer, dark gray dot: pathway with normalized enrich score
  higher than 1 or lower than −1, highlighted colored dot: pathways overlapped with
  45 CAD genes associated pathways, light gray dot: pathway with normalized enrich
  score lower than 1 or higher than −1; (C) methotrexate significantly downregulates
  activity-related genes of RA, SS, and SLE (p < 0.001), as well as gene signatures
  of RA (p < 0.001), SS (p < 0.001), SLE (p = 0.31); (D) methotrexate significantly
  downregulates pathways in cancer gene signatures in colorectal cancer, small-cell
  lung cancer, prostate cancer (p < 0.001); (E) pazopanib downregulates gene signatures
  of RA and SLE (p < 0.001); (F) tofacitinib downregulates gene signatures of non-melanoma
  skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma (p < 0.001); (G and H) pioglitazone downregulates
  gene signatures of some ADs (such as RA and SS) (p < 0.05) (G), and cancer (such
  as carcinoma and endometrial cancer) (p < 0.05) (H). NES: normalized enrichment
  score.'
