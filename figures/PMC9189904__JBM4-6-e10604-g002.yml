caption: Recruitment of β‐arrestin and signaling via the Gq/PLC/IP3/iCa2+pathway.
  (A) GBR‐24 (HEK293/GloSensor/β‐arrestin2YFP stable) cells() were transiently transfected
  to express the WT or a mutant PTH1R and then treated on coverslips with PTH(1‐34)TMR
  (30nM) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed, fixed, stained
  with DAPI, and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (magnification = ×400). Areas
  enclosed in dashed boxes are shown digitally enlarged 7×. ImageJ‐derived colocalization
  plots of β‐arrestin2YFP and with PTH(1‐34)TMR in individual cells, with corresponding
  Pearson correlation coefficients (R), are shown in the rightmost columns. (B) Analysis
  of iCa2+signaling was assessed in transiently transfected GS‐22a cells using the
  Ca‐sensitive fluorophore Fura2‐AM. After preloading the cells with Fura2‐AM, baseline
  ratiometric fluorescence (sequential excitation at 340 nm and 380; emission at 515 nm)
  was measured in a PerkinElmer Envision plate reader for 20 seconds prior to (baseline)
  and for 140 seconds after addition of PTH(1‐34) or PTHrP(1‐36) each at a concentration
  of 100nM. Shown are the means (±SEM) of data from five or four (PTHrP(1‐36) ligand)
  separate experiments.
