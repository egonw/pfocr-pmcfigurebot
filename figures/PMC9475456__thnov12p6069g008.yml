caption: 'ZEB1 binds to the DDX56 promoter and facilitates transcription of DDX56.
  (A) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the DDX56-luciferase construct together
  with the indicated plasmids for 48 h. (B-C) mRNA (B) and protein (C) levels of indicated
  genes were detected using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. (D) MHCC97H
  and Huh-7 cells were co-transfected with DDX56 promoter luciferase constructs and
  ZEB1-silencing molecules. (E) Computational prediction of ZEB1 binding sites on
  DDX56 promoter region (-2000 to +1) by JASPAR and MEM-suite matrix model. (F) ChIP-PCR
  assay was performed using anti-ZEB1 to confirm the two predicted ZEB1-binding sites
  on the DDX56 promoter. (G) EdU assay showed that ectopic DDX56 expression in ZEB1-silenced
  cells partially reversed the ZEB1 loss-of-function-mediated inhibitory effect on
  HCC proliferation. Scale bars: 100 Âµm. (H-I) Protein levels of ZEB1 and DDX56 in
  HCC tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues (n = 24) were examined using
  western blot analysis (H), followed by an analysis of their correlation (r = 0.4435,
  P = 0.03) (I). Protein band intensity was quantitated using Image J software. (J)
  A schematic model showing the ZEB1-DDX56-MIST1 axis regulating HCC proliferation.
  ZEB1 directly binds to the promoter region of DDX56 and promotes its transcription.
  Upregulated DDX56 enhances MIST1 transcription by recruiting MECOM and mono-methylating
  H3K9 at the MIST1 promoter, which subsequently reduces PTEN protein and facilitates
  AKT phosphorylation, to promote HCC proliferation. Importantly, the PTEN agonist,
  Oroxin B (OB), blocked the DDX56-mediated PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, suggesting
  that treating of HCC patients with OB may result in a beneficial therapeutic intervention.'
