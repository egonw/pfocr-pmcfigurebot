caption: ICOSL expressed on TNBC cells can induce the differentiation of Foxp3+ Treg
  cells, enhancing tumor cell growth and suppressing apoptosis in vitro. MDA-MB-231
  cells were infected with ICOSL overexpression lentivirus and negative control lentivirus.
  The specificity and efficiency were validated by (A) quantitative reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), (B) western blotting and (C) flow cytometry
  analysis. ※, MDA-MB-231 cells were sorted for ICOSL-negative MDA-MB-231 cells to
  be used as MDA-MB-231-control cells, which were used in all the following experiments.
  (D) Flow charts of our in vitro experiment. (E, F) After 7 days of cultivation with
  MDA-MB-231 cells, the rate of FOXP3+/ICOS+ T cells among CD4+ T cells was analyzed
  via flow cytometry. **P<0.05. (G) The levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-4 in
  cell culture supernatants measured with an ELISA kit (**P<0.05). Each experiment
  was repeated three times. (H-J) MDA-MB-231 ICOSL-OE cells and WM35 melanoma cells
  (3×106/mL) were cocultured with CD4+ T cells (1×106/mL). After 7 days, cell proliferation
  (H) and apoptosis assays (I, J) of tumor cells were conducted. Each experiment was
  repeated three times (**, P<0.05).
