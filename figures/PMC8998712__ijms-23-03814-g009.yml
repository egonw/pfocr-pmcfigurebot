caption: NFIB overexpression activated NFκB signaling pathway by up-regulating RIP2.
  Chicken HD11 cells were transfected with Sh-RIP2, pcDNA3.1-NFIB, and APEC, co-transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-NFIB and APEC, or co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-NFIB, Sh-RIP2, and
  APEC. (A,B) The mRNA expression of NFκBp65 (A) and IκBα (B) was detected by RT-qPCR
  (data are shown as the mean ± SD, n = 5 independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ***
  p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, LSD). (C) The protein expression
  of NFκBp65 and IκBα were measured by Western blot. (D,E) Image J software was used
  for gray-level analysis of NFκBp65 (D) and IκBα (E) in different treatments (data
  are shown as the mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, LSD).
