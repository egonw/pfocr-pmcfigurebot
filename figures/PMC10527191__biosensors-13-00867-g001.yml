caption: '(Left) Schematic illustration of possible links between antibiotic use in
  agriculture and human disease. The usage of antibiotics has an impact on the incidence
  of resistant microorganisms. The capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission
  is a critical factor in the impact of infection. Arrows connecting the two populations
  show: (A) direct transmission of bacteria that are not adapted for transmission
  to humans via the food chain (e.g., campylobacter, salmonella); or (B) direct transmission
  of organisms that are adapted for transmission to humans; and (C) transfer of resistance
  genes from the agricultural setting into pathogens that are transmitted among humans.
  (Right) Pathway of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes through agriculture
  and livestock.'
