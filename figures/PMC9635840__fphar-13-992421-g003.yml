  to: Nephropathy 1st inhibited the pro-fibrotic phenotypes in NRK-49F cells. (A)
  Western blot was used to detect the expression of the biomarkers of renal fibrosis,
  including FN, col-1, and quantification of the expression of FN and col-1. (B) Immunofluorescence
  staining was used to detect the expression of α-SMA and collagen III. Data were
  representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.'
