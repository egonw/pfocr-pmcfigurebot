figure_title: Identification of the hub genes in CRC by DEGs analysis and WGCNA
caption: 'a The DEGs of the four datasets and their intersection. b GES33113 and GSE9348
  modules have identified hierarchical cluster dendrograms of co-expressed genes.
  Each color line represents a color coding module, which contains a set of highly
  connected genes. Genes that cannot be accepted by any other module are indicated
  by gray modules. A total of 15 and 20 modules were identified in GES33113 and GSE9348,
  respectively. The lower panel lists the number of genes contained in each module.
  c Heat map of the correlation between the intrinsic genes of each module and clinical
  features in GES33113 and GSE9348. Each row corresponds to the module characteristic
  gene, and each column corresponds to the clinical characteristic. d Biological process
  (BP) of upregulated genes (a) and downregulated genes (b) in DEGs analysis. BP of
  GSE33113 turquoise module (c), GSE33113 yellow module (d), GSE9348 brown module
  (e) and GSE9348 turquoise module (f) in WGCNA. e PPI network and hub gene of upregulated
  (a) and downregulated (b) DEGs. Circles represent the nodes in the PPI network,
  gray straight lines represent the connection between the nodes. Pink circles represent
  the calculated hub genes, the circle becomes larger and the color becomes darker
  as the comprehensive scores increase. f PPI networks and hub genes of the turquoise
  module (a) and the yellow module (b) in GSE33113. PPI networks and hub genes of
  the brown module (c) and the turquoise module (d) in GSE9348. g Left panel: the
  intersection of GSE33113, GSE9348 and upregulated expression of DEGs. Right panel:
  the intersection of GSE33113, GSE9348 and downregulated expression of DEGs.'
