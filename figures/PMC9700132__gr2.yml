caption: A basic framework for the ambivalence effect in plants.The perception of
  a pathogen by plants occurs through cytoplasmic R proteins that recognize pathogen
  effectors. As a result of pathogen recognition, a cascade of signaling events is
  initiated. Ion fluxes lead to increased intracellular Ca2+ and H+ concentrations,
  which activate Ca2+-dependent protein kinases that phosphorylate and activate NADPH
  oxidases present in the membrane. NADPH oxidase complexes, together with mitochondria
  and chloroplasts, act as sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The
  increase in ROS production signals for the synthesis of salicylic acid (SA) in the
  chloroplast, which in turn leads to the generation of more ROS, leading to a cycle
  of continuous amplification of both molecules. The accumulation of SA causes a change
  in the redox state of the cell that triggers the separation of oligomers of the
  regulatory protein NPR1 into monomers. Several transcriptional (co)activators, such
  as NPR1, TGA, and WRKY, play a role in SA-mediated suppression of jasmonic acid
  (JA)-responsive genes. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is essential for SA-responsive
  defense gene expression, and it is required for SA-mediated suppression of the JA-mediated
  pathway. TGAs, which interact with NPR1, act as important regulators of SA-induced
  expression by binding to SA-responsive promoters. WRKY50 and WRKY51 are essential
  for SA-mediated suppression of JA signaling. WRKY70 is an important node of convergence
  between SA and JA signaling. The green frame highlights components whose expression
  has been shown to be responsive to SA. Arrows and lines with bars indicate positive
  and negative regulatory actions, respectively. See the text and  for further details.
