caption: 'Transcriptome sequencing of Arc9.136 under 1 mM H2O2. (A) Cluster analysis
  of the H2O2-treated group (group B: H-1, H-2, H-3) and nontreated group (group A:
  1-1, 1-2, 1-3). The length of the branch represents the distance between samples.
  (B) Volcano plot showing the DEGs between the H2O2-treated group (group B: H-1,
  H-2, H-3) and nontreated group (group A: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3). The X-axis indicates the
  fold change in gene expression (threshold, |log2 (treatment/control)| ≥ 0.5), while
  the Y-axis indicates the statistically significant level (threshold, p value ≤ 0.05).
  (C) Function enrichment scatter plot of DEGs by COG annotation. The rich factor
  represents the ratio of the number of target genes to the total number of annotated
  genes in this pathway. (D) Histogram analysis of DEGs by COG annotation.'
