caption: Significant differences in TME-related characteristics and biological features
  in eRNA subtypes(A–C) The GSVA plot showed a differentially activated pathway between
  the three eRNA subtypes. Each yellow bar showed an activated pathway, and each blue
  bar showed an inactivated pathway. (|t value| > 3 and p < 0.05).(D) The boxplot
  showed a statistical difference in EMT score between three eRNA subtypes (p < 2.2 × 10−16).(E)
  The boxplot showed a statistical difference in TMB between three eRNA subtypes (p =
  0.00077).(F) The proportion of MSI status between three eRNA subtypes (Fisher test,
  p = 7.922 × 10−5).(G) The boxplot showed a statistical difference in mRNAsi between
  three eRNA subtypes (p < 2.2 × 10−16).(H) The boxplot showed a statistical difference
  in IPS between three eRNA subtypes (p = 5.1 × 10−7).(I–L) The IC50s of chemotherapeutic
  agents with eRNA subtypes. (I) Axitinib; (J) bicalutamide; (K) cisplatin; (L) doxorubicin
  (p<0.05).
