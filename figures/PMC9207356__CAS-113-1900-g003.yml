caption: Hippo signaling and the regulation of Yes‐associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ‐binding motif (TAZ)‐dependent gene expression. (A) Once triggered,
  the Hippo pathway initiates the activation of the mammalian STE20‐like protein kinases
  (MST1/2; Hpo in Drosophila) supported by their adaptor protein Salvador homolog‐1
  (Sav1). MST1/2 phosphorylate the large tumor suppressor homolog kinases (LATS1/2) kinases
  to activate them, supported by their adaptor proteins Mob1a/b. Activated LATS1/2
  phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, negatively regulating their translocation from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus by either inducing binding to 14‐3‐3 protein or promoting degradation.
  In the absence of Hippo signaling, unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ bind to many transcription
  factors (TFs) and coactivate them to launch transcription of their target genes.
  In the liver, the main targets of YAP/TAZ binding are the transcriptional enhanced
  associate domain (TEAD) TFs. Transcription cofactor vestigial‐like protein 4 (VGLL4)
  competes with YAP/TAZ for binding to TEADs and represses TEAD target gene expression.
  (B) The indicated mechanical cues regulate the Hippo‐YAP/TAZ pathway by activating,
  or inactivating, Rho GTPases. These Rho GTPases promote F‐actin formation, which
  blocks LATS1/2 activity. Rho GTPase‐independent inhibition of LATS1/2 activity also
  exists. In the absence of LATS1/2‐mediated phosphorylation (and sometimes independently
  of LATS1/2), YAP/TAZ are free to enter the nucleus and coactivate transcription
  by TEADs, inducing the indicated diverse cellular responses. EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition; GPCR, G protein‐coupled receptor
