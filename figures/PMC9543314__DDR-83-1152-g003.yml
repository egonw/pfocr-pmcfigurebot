caption: Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) activated the BAX‐mitochondrial intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway to elicit GSDMD‐dependent pyroptosis. HCT116 cells were treated
  with SDG for 24 h. (a) The MMP was measured by fluorescent microscope, scale bar = 500 μm.
  (b)Total cellular extracts were prepared and subjected to western blot analysis
  analyses using antibodies against BAX and Cyto c. (c) Gel images of GSDMD‐N, Cyto
  c, and cleaved caspase‐1 expression levels in HCT116 cells in the presence or absence
  of BAX knockdown. (d) Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured by LDH assay
  in HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of BAX knockdown. Protein levels are
  expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). **p < .01 versus control. SD, standard deviation.
