caption: Biosynthesis pathway of folic acid from para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) using
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) coenzyme. PABA, as a precursor,
  contributes to the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) and then tetrahydrofolic
  acid (THFA). THFA, in turn, gives rise to thymidine, purines, and methionine. TMP/SMZ
  inhibits folate synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate
  synthetase (DHPS), respectively, as the two key enzymes of the folate pathway.
