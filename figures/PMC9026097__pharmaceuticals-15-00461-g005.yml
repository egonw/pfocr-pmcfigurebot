caption: 'NF-kB (RELA) target genes. (A) NFKBIA. (B) TNFAIP3. (C) BCL2L1. (D) ICAM1.
  In (A–D), average expression (log2 scale) is shown for each treatment (±1 standard
  error; * p < 0.05, comparison to CTL treatment). Expression is normalized to the
  average value in the CTL treatment for each gene. (E) RELA-activated genes. (F)
  RELA-suppressed genes. In (E,F), the value of |FC|max was calculated for each gene,
  where |FC|max is defined as max [abs(FCMMF, FCDRF, FCIDMF)], and the 23 RELA-activated
  or RELA-suppressed genes with highest value of |FC|max are shown. Non-black gene
  labels are used if there is significant differential expression (p < 0.05) for any
  of the three comparisons, in which case the label color matches the comparison associated
  with the lowest differential expression p-value. (G,H,K,L,O,P) FC estimates for
  RELA-activated genes. FC estimates are plotted and the proportion of fumarate-increased
  (red) fumarate-decreased (blue) genes is shown (p-value: Fisher’s exact test). The
  percentage of increased/decreased genes is also indicated (see legend). (I,J,M,N,Q,R)
  The cumulate overlap is shown between RELA-activated genes and genes ranked based
  upon their response to each fumarate compound. A positive area statistic denotes
  enrichment among fumarate-increased genes, and a negative area statistic indicates
  enrichment among fumarate-decreased genes (p-value: Wilcoxon rank sum test).'
