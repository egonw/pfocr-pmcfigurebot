caption: Nucleotide excision repair recognizes and repairs helix-distorting adducts
  like UV light-induced (6-4)photoproducts and cyclopyrimidine dimers. Two distinct
  pathways can be identified based on damage recognition, i.e., global-genome NER
  and transcription-coupled NER. Full pathway descriptions and protein details can
  be found in the text and . Red linked bases indicate UV photodimer substrate (or
  possibly another helix-distorting base damage). The blue strand designates synthesized
  RNA during transcription.
