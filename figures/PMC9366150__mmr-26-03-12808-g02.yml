caption: Silencing of miR-98-5p enhances the differentiation of HG-induced osteoblasts.
  ALP (A) activity and (B) differentiation ability of HG-induced osteoblasts after
  transfection with the miR-98-5p inhibitor were assessed. Scale bar, 50 µm. (C) mRNA
  and (D) protein expression levels of differentiation-regulated factors, BMP2, Runx2,
  OCN, OPN and collagen I in HG-induced osteoblasts following transfection with a
  miR-98-5p inhibitor were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and
  western blotting, respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
  MC3T3-E1 (Dif), MC3T3-E1 cells that were cultured in a differentiation medium for
  14 days; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein 2; Runx2, Runt-related
  transcription factor 2; OCN, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin; miR, microRNA; HG, high
  glucose; NC, negative control.
article_title: Inhibition of miR-98-5p promotes high glucose-induced suppression of
  preosteoblast proliferation and differentiation via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  signaling pathway by targeting BMP2.
