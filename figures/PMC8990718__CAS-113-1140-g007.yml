caption: Neutrophils in breast cancer (BC) have an immunosuppressive phenotype, which
  is associated with serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) expression. (A) Correlation between
  SAA1 expression level and infiltration level of neutrophils was analyzed by the
  TIMER 2.0 database. (B) Positive rates of infiltration of neutrophils in BC by TIMER
  2.0 database. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophils (CD11b+CD15+) isolated
  from BC patients. (D) Plasma expression levels of interleukin‐10 (IL‐10), arginase
  (Arg), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in neutrophils from BC patients
  and healthy controls. (E) Representative images (left) for positive and negative
  expression levels of SAA1 and CD66b in BC tissues. Black boxes indicate areas shown
  at a higher magnification (200×). Quantification data of CD66b+ cells in positive
  and negative expression levels of SAA1, expressed as number of immunohistochemistry
  positive cells per field. Scale bar = 50 μm. (F) Correlation analysis between SAA1
  expression in plasma and IL‐10, Arg, and iNOS expression levels in neutrophils from
  BC patients. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. **p < 0.01
