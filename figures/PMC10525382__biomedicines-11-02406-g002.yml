caption: Cabozantinib-resistant human MDA-MB-431 TNBC cells demonstrate a lack of
  inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and AKT signaling. MDA-MB-231 cells
  with low-resistance (231LR) or high-resistance (231HR) to cabozantinib were developed
  as outlined in the Materials and Methods and . (A) Cells were treated with cabozantinib
  (CBZ; 0.1 nM–100 μM) and subjected to colony-forming assays over 10–14 days, with
  media and inhibitors refreshed every 4 days. Non-linear regression was used to determine
  IC50 values. (B,C) MDA-MB-231 cell models were subjected to transwell migration
  (B) and invasion (C) assays (24 h) in the presence of cabozantinib (5 µM) or DMSO
  vehicle control for 24 h ± 10 µg/mL Mitomycin C (MC) to control for proliferation.
  The number of migratory or invasive cells was normalized to 231S treated with DMSO
  (-Mitomycin C) control (n = 3). α = significantly different than respective DMSO
  (−MC) control. β = significantly different than the respective DMSO (+MC) control.
  (D) Representative immunoblots of cell lysates from the resistant and sensitive
  cell lines treated with either 5 µM cabozantinib or DMSO control for 24 h, with
  Amido Black staining used for loading control. The corresponding quantitative densitometric
  analysis is presented in .
