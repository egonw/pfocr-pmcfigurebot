caption: Evolution and diversification of gene families involved in the CS pathway
  in Cucurbitales. A, Cucurbitacin synthesis pathway. B, Identification of the gene
  families involved in the CS pathway in the studied genomes. C, Phylogenetic tree
  of the genes in FPS family of the Cucurbitales and V. vinifera genomes. Genes from
  different species are marked with different colors. The dots on the three layers
  represent the gene tandem duplication, paralogous, and orthologous relationships
  (marked with a, b, and c, respectively), and the same color represents the same
  group of relationships within and between genomes. D, P450 gene amplification model
  related to gene duplication events in C. moschata. P450 genes are displayed in blue
  patches. Curved lines (gray) link the collinear gene pairs generated at the period
  from the divergence between V. vinifera and Cucurbitales to the CCT event. Curved
  lines (red and plum) link gene pairs generated at the period from now to the CST
  and from the CST to the CCT event, respectively. E, The chromosomal distributions
  of P450 genes in the selected genomes. The lines between gene pairs on the same
  chromosome represent homologous genes generated at the period from the divergence
  between V. vinifera and CCT event. The lines between gene pairs on the different
  chromosome represent homologous genes generated by the divergence between the species.
  The β1, β2, γ1, and γ2 represent the gene clusters. F, The CDS–UTR structures of
  a set of orthologous FPS genes in selected genomes. The genes with different colors
  present the different species, and the shadow in one species shows that they come
  from the different subgenomes generated by the polyploidization event.
