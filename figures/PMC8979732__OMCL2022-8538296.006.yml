caption: NOX4/ROS/CaMKII pathway was involved in the effect of ageing. (a) Typical
  image of DHE staining showing the ROS level in young and old mouse heart tissues.
  (b) Histogram of ROS generation in young and old mice (P < 0.001). (c, d) Original
  image of Western blotting showing the band of NOX4, NOX2 (c), p-CaMKII, ox-CaMKII,
  and t-CaMKII (f). (d–i) Histograms of the protein expression levels of NOX2 (P >
  0.05), NOX4 (P < 0.01), p-CaMKII (P < 0.01), ox-CaMKII (P < 0.05), and t-CaMKII
  (P > 0.05). n = 6 (young group) and 8 (old group). Compared with the young group,
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
