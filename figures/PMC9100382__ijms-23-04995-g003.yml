caption: Simplified schematic representation of the major signaling pathways involved
  in astrocytes upon ischemia, displaying beneficial and/or detrimental effects in
  CNS pathology. Sirtuin 1, 2, 4 and 5 (SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT4, and SIRT5, respectively)
  are shown to protect the brain. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is largely neuroprotective in
  ischemic stroke, but it has been also shown that it can lead to the mitochondrial
  accumulation of the pro-apoptotic lipid molecule. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) leads to necrotic
  cell death, while the consequence of sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) up-regulation is still unknown.
  The purinergic pathway in reactivated astrocytes mainly acts through Purinergic
  P2X Receptor 7 (P2X7) and Purinergic Receptor P2Y G-Protein Coupled 12 (P2Y12) receptors
  showing beneficial effects. Multiple EGF-like Domain 10 (MEGF10) and GULP PTB Containing
  Engulfment Adaptor 1 (GULP1) as phagocytic pathways are up-regulated together with
  ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1 (ABCA1) and contribute to the remodeling
  of damaged tissues. NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) also shows a neuroprotective role,
  while the NF-k√ü signaling pathway contributes to the progression of ischemia. MAPK/ERK,
  PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways can aggravate or alleviate neuronal damage
  upon ischemia. The MAPK/ERK pathway shows pro-apoptotic roles in astrocytes upon
  ischemia, while the activation of this pathway is able to mediate post-ischemic
  astrocyte proliferation and survival trough changes in Bcl-2-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
  gene expression. PI3K/AKT can either induce neuronal survival or neuronal death
  through changes in Bcl-2 gene expression. The inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway can reduce the expression of High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) in brain
  tissue after cerebral ischemia, which further reduces the inflammatory response,
  while the STAT3 pathway can target glypican 6 (Gpc6) in astrocytes towards neuroprotective
  phenotypes and neural regeneration.
