caption: Overview of signaling pathways involved in the regulation of autophagy. (1)
  Growth factors and nutrients can induce PI3K, which activates AKT and subsequently
  mTORC1. Also, the activated AKT induce mTORC1 through TSC1/2 inhibition. (2) Growth
  factors inducethe Ras–Raf–MEK‐ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This pathway can directly
  induce autophagy. ERK complex can inhibit TSC1/2 complex, leading to activating
  mTORC1. (3) Under starvation and stress condition, Bcl2 is phosphorylated by JNK1
  and thereby separated from Beclin1. Then, Beclin1 induces Vps34 complex formation,
  an important protein complex in the autophagy process. (4) P53 has different roles
  in autophagy. Under stress conditions, p53 nuclear localization promotes autophagy
  inducers such as DRAM and DAPK1. Nevertheless, cytoplasmic p53 leads to autophagy
  inhibition through Beclin1 and AMPK blocking.
