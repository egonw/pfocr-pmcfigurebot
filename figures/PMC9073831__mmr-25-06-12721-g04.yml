caption: 'Overexpression of HOXB2 reverses the inhibitory effect of NUSAP1 knockdown
  on the metastasis of nephroblastoma cells. (A) Wound healing assay was performed
  to detect cell migration. (B) Transwell assay was conducted to detect cell invasion.
  Magnification, Ã—200. (C) Western blotting was performed to detect the expression
  of metastasis-related proteins. ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC; ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs.
  shRNA-NUSAP1 + Ov-NC. HOXB2, homeobox protein Hox-B2; NUSAP1, nucleolar and spindle-associated
  protein 1; Ov, overexpression vector; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control.'
article_title: Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation,
  invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
