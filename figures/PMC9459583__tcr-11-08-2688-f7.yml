caption: 'GO and pathway enrichment analysis of the ACSL4 co-expressed genes in TCGA-KIRC.
  (A) The most important pathway for gene enrichment of ACSL4 co-expression was Ubiquitin
  mediated proteolysis pathway (P=1.6E-3). (B,C) In the biological process and molecular
  function ontology, protein ubiquitination (GO: 0016567; P=5.0E-4) and ubiquitin-protein
  transferase activity (GO: 0004842; P=1.6E-15) constituted the majority of enriched
  GO categories. (D) In the CC ontology, endocytic vesicle (GO: 0030139; P=6.3E-10)
  ranked the top in the pathophysiological process. GO, Gene ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; BP, biological process; MF, molecular function;
  CC, cellular component; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; KIRC, kidney renal clear
  cell carcinoma.'
