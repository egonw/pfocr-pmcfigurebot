caption: 'Ubenimex suppresses autophagy to promote 5-FU-induced apoptosis by inhibiting
  the activation of the CD13/EMP3/FAK/NF-κB pathway. (A) Immunofluorescence staining
  of p-FAK with 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex treatment or pretransfected with pEGFP-N1-CD13
  or pTZU-CD13-shRNA on SGC-7901/5-FU cells. (B) Western blotting analysis of autophagy
  related proteins with 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex treatment or pretransfected with pEGFP-N1-CD13
  or pTZU-CD13-shRNA after 5-FU pretreated on SGC-7901/5-FU cells. GAPDH is shown
  as a loading control. Quantification was performed by a densitometry analysis and
  normalized to GAPDH levels. The bars indicate the means ± SD from the 3 independent
  experiments (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and #P>0.05). (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining of LC3B with 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex treatment or pretransfected with pEGFP-N1-CD13
  or pTZU-CD13-shRNA after 5-FU pretreated on SGC-7901/5-FU cells. (D) Western blotting
  analysis of apoptosis related proteins with 0.12 mg/mL ubenimex treatment or pretransfected
  with pEGFP-N1-CD13 or pTZU-CD13-shRNA after 5-FU pretreated on SGC-7901/5-FU cells.
  GAPDH is shown as a loading control. Quantification was performed by a densitometry
  analysis and normalized to GAPDH levels. The bars indicate the means ± SD from the
  3 independent experiments (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and #P>0.05). (E) Flow
  cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI double-stained SGC-7901/5-FU cells with 0.12
  mg/mL ubenimex treatment or pretransfected with pEGFP-N1-CD13 or pTZU-CD13-shRNA
  after 5-FU pretreated. Representative histograms are shown (left panels), as well
  as the means ± SD of the proportions of apoptotic cells in three independent experiments
  (right panel). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ****P<0.0001. DAPI, 4'',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  FAK, focal adhesion kinase; Ube, ubenimex; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein;
  5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; EMP3, epithelial membrane protein 3; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  SD, standard deviation.'
