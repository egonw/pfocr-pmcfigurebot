caption: 'PA inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in cell models of breast and pancreatic
  cancer. Seahorse flux analysis showing oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular
  acidification rates (ECAR) of AsPC-1 and T-47D cells pretreated ( a, b, e and f
  ) or titrated with PA ( c, d, g and h ). Injections were as follows: I: Injection
  of PA (0.5 µg/mL). O: Oligomycine (1.5 µM). R: Rotenone/Antimycine (0.5 µM). Black
  is control, dark grey is solvent control (EtOH) and light grey is PA. Each panel
  is representative of 4 experimental replicates (n = 4), each performed in technical
  triplicate. The error bars represent standard deviation.'
