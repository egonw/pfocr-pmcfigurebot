caption: 'GSEA analysis of all DEGs at each point post-MI in mRNA-seq data. (A) Apoptosis
  and autophagy enriched in DEGs on day 3 post-MI, (F) day 7 post-MI. (B,C), respectively,
  represent the expression of related items in the MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway on day 3 post-MI; (G,H) are on day 7 post-MI. (D,I) Heatmaps revealing
  the expression of key genes in the injured and uninjured areas at various time points
  after MI. Part (1) includes MAPK-signaling-pathway-related genes; (2) contains PI3K-AKT-signaling-pathway-related
  genes. (E,J) 4 GSEA pathways annotated by S100a8/a9 on day 3 post-MI. NES: Normalized
  Enrichment Score, which normalizes the enrichment score according to the size of
  the gene set.'
