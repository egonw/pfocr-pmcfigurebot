caption: 'Experiments 2 and 3: RNA-sequencing of EU- and Non-EU–labeled mRNA from
  plantaris after 72 h of mechanical overload.A, pathway analysis of genes upregulated
  in the EU-labeled fraction in OV versus sham. B, pathway analysis of genes upregulated
  in the Non-EU–labeled fraction in OV versus sham. C, Myc mRNA levels in the EU and
  Non-EU fractions. D, histone genes elevated in the Non-EU fraction during overload.
  E, Dnmt1 mRNA levels in EU and Non-EU fractions. F, pathway analysis of genes downregulated
  in the EU-labeled fraction in OV versus sham. G, pathway analysis of genes downregulated
  in the Non-EU–labeled fraction in OV versus sham. EU, 5-Ethenyl uridine; OV, overload.'
