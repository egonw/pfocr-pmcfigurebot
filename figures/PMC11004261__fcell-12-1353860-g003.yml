caption: 'Overview of the signaling pathway of DPYSL3. DPYSL3 is primarily located
  in the nervous system and is crucial in enhancing neurite growth, guiding axons,
  and shaping the nervous system’s structural framework. This gene further regulates
  the actin cytoskeleton, which promotes the cell migration. F-actin co-localizes
  in lamellipodia and maintains the equilibrium, causing overexpression of DYPSL3
  following the promotion of cell migration. The level of DPYSL3 changes with a change
  in MYCN expression, which GSK-3β regulates. DYPSL3, Dihydropyrimidinase-like 3;
  EZH2, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2; Akt: Akt serine/threonine kinase family; MYCN,
  myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma.'
