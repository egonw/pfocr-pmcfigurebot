caption: '(a) Illustration of the predicted transcriptional regulating and secondary
  walls synthesis genes of branch growth in elm. The expression levels (Log2(FC))
  of selected differentially expressed genes in fast- and slow-growing cultivars are
  shown on the right. A red color indicates that the gene is highly expressed in the
  branch samples. Log2(FC) means Log2() value of fold change for unigenes. (b) The
  biosynthesis pathway of the general phenylpropanoid and lignin. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase; TAL, tyrosine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:
  CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/Quinatehydroxycinnamoyltransferase;
  CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; CSE, caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase. The color of the proteins indicates the expression of their coding
  genes in fast and slow growing branches: red indicates up-regulated in the four
  comparisons (F1vS1, F1vS2, F2vS1, F2vS2), orange indicates up-regulated in three
  comparisons, yellow indicates up-regulated in two comparisons.'
