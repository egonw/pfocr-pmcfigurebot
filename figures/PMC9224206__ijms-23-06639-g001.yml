caption: 'Functional crop protection via a foliar dsRNA spray to induce RNAi. (A).
  Plant uptake of dsRNA can be divided into two stages: foliar uptake where sprayed
  dsRNA molecules from the leaf surfaces enter the interior of the leaf tissue, and
  cellular uptake where dsRNA molecules get taken up into plant cells. Following foliar
  uptake, sprayed dsRNAs may diffuse through the leaf interior and cellular uptake
  may occur. (B). Once dsRNA penetrates the cell wall pores and cell membrane to enter
  the cytoplasm, the plant RNAi machinery can process dsRNAs into siRNAs. Produced
  siRNAs can lead to degradation of viral transcripts in local cells and also be transported
  to adjacent cells. siRNAs are likely to participate in long distance signaling through
  vascular bundles to other parts of the plant. It is uncertain how non-processed
  dsRNA in the apoplastic pathway are translocated systemically. (C). dsRNA/siRNAs
  from the plant surfaces or in the plant system can be taken up by different targets
  and trigger an RNAi response depending on their sensitivity to dsRNA or siRNA. Figure
