caption: Identification of DEGs/DEPs. (A) Number of DEGs/DEPs. (B) Functional category
  enrichment of DEGs/DEPs. DEGs/DEPs were classified into two groups of up-regulated
  or down-regulated, without DEGs and DEPs comparison. The degree of the pathway enrichment
  was indicated according to the value of −log(q-value), as shown in the color bar.
  Each group was indicated by expression level (“g” for gene and “p” for protein,
  respectively) and regulatory direction (“up” for up-regulated and “dn” for down-regulated,
  respectively). The color brightness represents the degree of significant enrichment
  of pathways, as shown in the color bar.
