caption: Validation of candidate PTPs regulating the Hippo pathway. A triplicate test
  was performed to validate the result of the first screen. The fold changes in LATS-BS
  and STBS-Luc reporters were calculated after cotransfection with each phosphatase.
  “*” represents a fold change greater than 2.
