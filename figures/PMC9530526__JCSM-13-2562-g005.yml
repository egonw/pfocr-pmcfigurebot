caption: 'Proteo‐ADPT in young and replicatively aged cells during early differentiation.
  (A) Heatmap of proteins with significant interaction (P < 0.05: FDR 5%) between
  age and cell absolute abundance with 49 proteins. Blue increased and red decreased
  expression. Proteins were clustered based on dendrogram on left of heatmap and to
  the right of the heatmap, top‐ranked biological processes were displayed in bar
  graphs with corresponding number of proteins. (B) Selected individual protein rate
  of abundance change, absolute synthesis and degradation rates in young and aged
  myoblasts. (C) Proteo‐ADPT model on enzymes identified in glycolysis pathway. Significance
  between young and aged indicated with *. All experiments N = 3 in duplicate.'
article_title: Degradation of ribosomal and chaperone proteins is attenuated during
  the differentiation of replicatively aged C2C12 myoblasts.
