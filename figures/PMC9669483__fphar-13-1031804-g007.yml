caption: (A) The expression of TNF-α, p-P65, P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC was detected
  in MTrPs rats after 2 h of tail vein injection and local gastrocnemius injection
  with the same concentration of dexmedetomidine (100 μg/ml), and it was found that
  the protein levels in the gastrocnemius group were significantly lower than those
  in the MTrPs and intravenous injection groups. (B). The mRNA expression levels of
  MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC in the local injection of the dexmedetomidine group were lower
  than those in the MTrPs and intravenous injection groups, with GAPDH as the internal
  reference mRNA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
