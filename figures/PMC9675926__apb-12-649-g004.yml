caption: Different genes play a crucial role in resistance to multiple drugs (). Genes
  related with MAP kinase pathways which include, GRMI, KLF4 etc have clear link with
  drug resistance in breast cancer. KLF4 knockdown cause tamoxifen resistance and
  STAT3cause paclitaxel resistance. Another important members involved are ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transporters gene family which include ABCB1, ABCG2 and Multiple
  drug resistant gene family like MDR1 genes. Chemotherapy resistance induced by preventing
  apoptosis is mediated by genes like FOXM1, XIAP, BIRC5, XRCC2, BRCA2, CLDN6, ASK1,
  SIRT, AMPK, TWIST etc. Genes associated with hippo pathway and vault proteins associated
  genes induce drug resistance by various mechanisms. Conventional cancer chemotherapy
  is severely restricted by multidrug resistant tumor cells due to changes in the
  level or activity of membrane transporters that mediate energy dependent drug efflux
  and proteins that influence drug metabolism. The extensive use of chemotherapeutic
  agents for cancer treatment has led to many patients being cured. Sadly, many cancers
  do not yet respond to chemotherapy, and other cancers which initially respond later
  become resistant. The use of biologics and gene therapy is a highly active area
  of research to address the problems of chemo resistance. Combination therapy, a
  type of treatment that incorporates two or more therapeutic agents, is one of the
  cornerstones of cancer treatment. Similar to the monotherapy strategy, the amalgamation
  of anti-cancer drugs increases effectiveness because it addresses main pathways
  in a synergistic or additive way. ().
