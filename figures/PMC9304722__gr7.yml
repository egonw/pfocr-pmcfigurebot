caption: Torin2 inhibited related proteins expression of MAPKs signaling pathway in
  LPS-induced (100 ng/mL) RAW264.7 murine macrophages respectively. (A–C) Protein
  level of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, as detected
  by Western blot respectively (n = 3). The values are expressed as means ± S.E.M,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the model. The values are expressed as means ± S.E.M,
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. the model. MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK,
  extracellular regulated protein kinases; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
