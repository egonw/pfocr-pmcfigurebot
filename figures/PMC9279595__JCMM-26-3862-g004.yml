caption: LGR5 overexpression enhances the Wnt signalling and osteogenic differentiation
  of the thoracic ligamentum flavum cells (TLFCs). A and B, the effects of the LGR5
  overexpression on mRNA levels of Wnt related genes and osteogenic markers were evaluated
  by qRT‐PCR after Lv‐LGR5 transfection, *p < 0.05 vs. Lv‐NC group; (C) the effects
  of the LGR5 overexpression on the protein levels of Wnt related genes measured by
  Western blot analysis; (D) ALP staining following the LGR5 overexpression; the scale
  bar represents 500 μm
article_title: LGR5 regulates osteogenic differentiation of human thoracic ligamentum
  flavum cells by Wnt signalling pathway.
