figure_title: ANGPTL2 is enriched in human fetal semilunar valves and associated with
  cell cycle and senescence pathways
caption: a Heatmap of genes expressed in human fetal semilunar valves and adult AoV
  leaflets. b Close-up view of the heatmap showing significant enrichment of ANGPTL2,
  HEY1 and NOTCH1 in fetal semilunar valves; *significantly expressed genes (FDR < 0.05
  and log2 FC > 1.5). c Pathway enrichment for the turquoise heart valve gene module
  obtained from WGCNA.
