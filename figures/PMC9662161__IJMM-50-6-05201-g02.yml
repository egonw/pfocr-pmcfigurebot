caption: Lycorine changes the activation level of the Akt signaling pathway via RBM10.
  (A-C) Lycorine significantly decreased the activation level of the Akt signaling
  pathway. (D) Lycorine significantly increased the protein expression levels of E-cadherin
  and significantly reduced the protein expression levels of E-cadherin. (E-G) Despite
  the presence of lycorine, the inhibition of RBM10 significantly increased the activation
  level of the Akt signaling pathway. (H) Decreasing RBM10 expression induced a significant
  increase in N-cadherin protein expression. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. RBM10, RNA binding
  motif 10; NC, negative control; p, phosphorylated; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

  inhibits the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells.
