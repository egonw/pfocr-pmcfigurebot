figure_title: Altered plasma bile acid composition in heterozygous carriers of CYP8B1
  mutations
caption: CYP8B1 is a 12α-hydroxylase, catalyzing the conversion of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  to generate 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. (A) Schematic of the bile acid synthesis
  pathway with CYP8B1 indicated. (B) The ratio of CYP8B1 product (7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one)
  to substrate (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) is decreased in mutation carriers. In
  addition, the ratios of (C) 12α to non-12α bile acids, and (D) cholic acid (CA)
  to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are decreased in CYP8B1 mutation carriers. (E) The
  composition of the plasma bile acid pool is shown in carriers and noncarriers. In
  italic font are the bile acids significantly different between mutation carriers
  and controls (also shown in ). Data (nonparametric) are shown as box-and-whisker
  plots with median (horizontal lines), interquartile range (boxes), and whiskers
  generated by Tukey’s method, and were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
