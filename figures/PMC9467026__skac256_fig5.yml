caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes in the liver between control (CON) group and Allium mongolicum Regel
  ethanol extract (AME) groups. The x-axis is a rich factor that indicates the ratio
  of the sample number of genes/transcripts enriched in this pathway and the background
  number of annotated genes/transcripts. The y-axis is pathways. The P-value of all
  pathways is less than 0.05.
article_title: Transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes of the synthesis of
  branched-chain fatty acids related to mutton flavor in the lamb liver using Allium
  mongolicum Regel extract.
