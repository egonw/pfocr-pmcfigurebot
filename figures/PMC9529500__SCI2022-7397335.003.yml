caption: Schematic diagram of signaling pathways that can be activated by LIPUS in
  bone-derived cells for regulating cell biology functions and implant osseointegration,
  which include integrin and focal adhesion pathway, MAPK pathway, SHH pathway, BMP/Smad
  pathway, SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling, and COX-2/PGE2 signaling.
