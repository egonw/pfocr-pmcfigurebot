figure_title: LHPP suppresses aerobic glycolysis
caption: A Relative mRNA expression levels of glycolytic genes and glutamine transporters
  in LHPP-overexpressing or LHPP-knockdown MGC-803 cells and control cells by qPCR.
  B Protein expression levels of glycolytic genes and glutamine transporters in LHPP-overexpressing
  or LHPP-knockdown MGC-803 cells and control cells on western blot. C IHC staining
  of LHPP and HIF1A in TMAs and their correlation. Scale bars = 100 μm. D Oxygen consumption
  rate and extracellular acidification rate of LHPP-overexpressing or LHPP-knockdown
  MGC-803 cells and control cells were measured using the Seahorse Bioscience XF96
  analyser. E Human phosphokinase microarray assay analysis of the conditioned medium
  from stably transfected HGC-27 cells. A summary of the relative signal intensities
  of the indicated proteins is shown. G, H IHC staining of LHPP and p-GSK3b in TMAs
  and their correlation. Scale bars = 200 μm. F Combined LHPP and GSK3b by co-immunoprecipitation.
  I Protein expression levels of the Wnt pathway in LHPP-overexpressing or LHPP-knockdown
  MGC-803 cells and control cells on western blot. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon
  test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, KEGG Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and
