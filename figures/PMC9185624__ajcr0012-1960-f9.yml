caption: MYBL2 induces cell migration and metastasis by promoting SNAI1-independent
  Smad pathway-mediated EMT. A. Levels of EMT-related proteins in HepG2 and HuH6 cells.
  B. Protein levels of three EMT-related signaling pathways in HepG2 and HuH6 cells.
  C. mRNA levels of EMT-induced transcription factors in HepG2 and HuH6 cells. D.
  Results of western blotting show that SNAI1 expression was significantly upregulated
  in MYBL2-overexpressing HepG2 cells compared with that of controls. E. Expression
  of SNAI1, ZO-1, and FN1 in MYBL2-upregulation HepG2 cells treated with the Smad
  inhibitor (LY2157299) for 72 h.
article_title: MYBL2 accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and hepatoblastoma
  metastasis via the Smad/SNAI1 pathway.
