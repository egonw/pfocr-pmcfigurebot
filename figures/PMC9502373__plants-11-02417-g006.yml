caption: KEGG pathway classification and functional enrichment of DEGs. (A) Venn diagrams
  of DEGs assigned to KEGG pathways in two sugarcane cultivars treated by PBZ. The
  upregulated DEGs of LC05−136 and GGZ001 are shown in yellow and blue, respectively;
  the downregulated DEGs of LC05−136 and GGZ001 are shown in pink and green, respectively.
  (B) Pathway functional enrichment of up− and downregulated DEGs in LC05−136. (C)
  Pathway functional enrichment of up− and downregulated DEGs in GGZ001.
