caption: 'PF was protected by TRF via the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway:
  (a–d) The expression of fibrosis proteins induced by BLM in SD rats was decreased;
  protein expressions of p-IkBα (b), Ikkβ (c) and p-p65 (d) in lung samples were examined
  by WB analysis; n = 3. (e–j) Representative statistical analyses of TNF-α (e), IFN-γ
  (f), IL-13 (g), IkBα (h), NF-κB (i) and Ikkβ (j) in mRNA by RT-qPCR; n = 3. Note:
  * represents p < 0.05 in comparison to the control group; # represents p < 0.05
  in comparison to the model group.'
