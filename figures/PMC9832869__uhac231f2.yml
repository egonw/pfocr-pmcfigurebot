caption: 'Comparative transcriptome analysis of genes involved in the gypenoside biosynthetic
  pathway. The expression value of each identified candidate gene is colored in log10(FPKM)
  in five tissues: fruit, flower, stem, leaf, and tendril. Low to high expression
  is indicated by the change in color from blue to red.'
article_title: Diploid chromosome-level reference genome and population genomic analyses
  provide insights into Gypenoside biosynthesis and demographic evolution of Gynostemma
  pentaphyllum (Cucurbitaceae).
