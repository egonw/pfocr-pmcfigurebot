caption: 'Cytogram showing annexin-V/propidium-iodide-stained “Quadrant charts show
  Q2-1 (necrotic cells, AV−/PI+), Q2-2 (late apoptotic cells, AV+/PI+), Q2-3 (normal
  cells, AV−/PI−), Q2-4 (early apoptotic cells, AV+/PI−)” and the cell-cycle distribution
  of both untreated and treated HL60 treated with compound 4 (IC50 = 8.09 μM, 48 h,
  A) and HepG2 cells treated with compound 8b (IC50 = 13.14 μM, 48 h, B), with a bar
  chart representation of cell-population percentages in different cell-cycle phases.
