caption: (a) HE staining of asthma mice lung tissues, PD3 treatment alleviated airway
  pathological lesion. Blue arrows pointed the inflammatory cells immersed in the
  lung tissues. The 200x scale bar was 100 μm; the 400x scale bar was 50 μm. (b) AB-PAS
  staining of asthma mice lung tissues, PD3 treatment alleviated airway mucus secretion
  and goblet cells hyperplasia. The 200x scale bar was 100 μm; the 400x scale bar
  was 50 μm. PD3, platycodin D3.
