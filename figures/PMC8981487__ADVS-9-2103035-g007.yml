caption: IL‐36γ induces upregulation of extracellular matrix genes through the JNK
  pathway. A) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated genes of colon organoids from wild‐type
  C57BL/6 mice that were left unstimulated or stimulated with IL‐36γ (20 ng mL‐1)
  or IL‐36γ plus IL‐36Ra (20 ng mL‐1) for 6 h. B) qRT‐PCR analysis of the indicated
  genes of colon organoids from wild‐type C57BL/6 mice that were left unstimulated
  or stimulated with IL‐36γ (20 ng mL‐1) plus DMSO, SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), IMD0354
  (an IKK inhibitor), SCH772984 (an ERK inhibitor) or SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor)
  for 6 h. A,B) Two‐tailed student's t‐test. A,B) Graphs show mean SEM. A,B) Data
  are representative of two independent experiments.
