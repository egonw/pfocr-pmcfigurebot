caption: 'Heatmap of correlation between the core microbiome and key metabolic pathway
  in choledocholithiasis patients. Thirteen core genera of bile microbiome and their
  correlations with the twelve discrepant metabolite pathways in different prognosis
  groups were analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. The Pearson correlation
  coefficient between the genus and the metabolic pathway was calculated and shown
  in colored matrix; red represents a positive correlation, while green represents
  a negative correlation. A: Matrix heatmap shows the correlations between different
  genera and metabolite pathways in choledocholithiasis patients without recurrence
  post-endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST); B: Matrix heatmap shows the correlations between
  different genera and metabolite pathways in recurrent choledocholithiasis patients
  post-EST. Statistical significance is expressed as aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01.'
