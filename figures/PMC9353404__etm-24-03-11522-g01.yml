caption: ANGPT2 silencing inhibits proliferation of EC-9706 esophageal cancer cells.
  (A) Relative mRNA expression of ANGPT2 was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. (B) Protein expression of ANGPT2 was detected using western blot analysis.
  ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC. (C) Viability of EC-9706 cells was detected using Cell
  Counting Kit-8. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control. (D) Proliferation of EC-9706
  cells was detected using EDU staining assay (scale bar, 50 Âµm). (E) Colony formation
  assay of EC-9706 cells (scale bar, 34 mm). ANGPT2, angiopoietin-2; shRNA, short
  harpin RNA; NC, negative control; OD, optical density.
article_title: HOXB5-activated ANGPT2 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion
  and angiogenic effect of esophageal cancer cells via activating ERK/AKT signaling
  pathway.
