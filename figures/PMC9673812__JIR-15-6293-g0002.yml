caption: Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate alleviates the pyroptosis in atherosclerotic
  plaques. (A) NLRP3 and ASC in endothelial cells (marked by CD31) the aortic arches
  were detected by immunofluorescence. (B) GSDMD level in sections of the aortic arches
  was detected by immunofluorescence. (C) Immunohistochemistry analysis of IL-1β expression.
  (D) Immunohistochemistry analysis of IL-18 expression. Data are represented as mean ± SD
  of three independent replicates; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs NCD group; †P < 0.05,
  ††P < 0.01 vs AS model group; Scale bar = 50 μm.
