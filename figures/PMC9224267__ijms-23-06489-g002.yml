caption: 'Role of tumor microenvironment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC in influencing resistance
  pathways to targeted TKI treatment and potential targets for immunotherapy. EGFR
  mutations are associated with immunosuppressive TME, lower tumor-mutation burden
  (TMB), and increased PD-L1 expression. EGFR mutations may promote cancer immune
  escape through modulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which in turn determine T-cells
  inactivity and/or exhaustion. This also leads to EGFR-TKI resistance. In addition,
  EGFR mutations influence several TME components, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TILs), Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs, and immunoregulatory/proinflammatory cytokines, i.e.,
  IL-6. The latter, through the activation of the STAT-3 intracellular pathway, contribute
  to tumor growth and resistance to targeted therapies. Abbreviations: AKT—serine-threonine
  kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK—extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; IL—Interleukin; JAK—Janus kinase; MHC—major histocompatibility complex;
  MEK—mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDSC—myeloid-derived suppressor cells; NF-kB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; PI3K—phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; PD-1—programmed
  death; PD-L1—programmed death ligand-1; TKI—Tyrosine kinase inhibitors; Treg—regulatory
  T-cell; STAT3—signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; TCR—T-cell receptor;
  TMB—tumor mutational burden. Created with BioRender.com (https://biorender.com/,
