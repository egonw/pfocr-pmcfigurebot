caption: Both GAG metabolic pathways and genes are highly related to EMT status and
  prognosis among NSCLC patients.(A) The left panel is a Venn diagram of differentially
  expressed genes (fold change > 1.5) after TGF-β-induced NSCLC EMT in A549, HCC-827,
  and NCI-H358 cell lines (GSE49644). There are 1307 differential expression probes
  from three NSCLC cell lines and 216 probes (151 genes) with enzymes and transporters
  annotations. The right panel is a heatmap of 151 metabolic genes among E-type and
  M-type NSCLC cells. Red indicates higher expression, and blue indicates lower expression
  in mesenchymal-type NSCLC cells. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of EMT-associated
  metabolic genes. The pathways are ranked according to the -log (P-value) by using
  Fisher's exact test. (C) Pearson correlation analysis between the expression levels
  of metabolic genes and EMT scores in 246 NSCLC patients (GSE31210). The y-axis indicates
  the correlation coefficient (R). The orange color indicates R ≥ 0.5, and the green
  color indicates R ≤ -0.5. (D) Forest plot of individual metabolic probe hazard ratios
  in GSE31210. The dashed lines indicate hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5 or 2. Genes in the
  GAG biosynthesis pathway were highly correlated with EMT status and poor prognostic
  values in NSCLC patients. (E) Overall survival analysis of genes belongs to the
  GAG biosynthesis pathway from the lung cancer microarray dataset (GSE31210) (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the web version of this article.).
