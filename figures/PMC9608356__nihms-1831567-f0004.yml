figure_title: Loss of NetG1 in CAFs alters the metabolite profile of CAF-sEVs
caption: '(A) Relative differences in total particle concentrations found in sEV fractions
  isolated from Ctl. vs. FRA1KD, and 4EBP1KD CAFs; normalized to the mean Ctl. CAF-sEV
  value. Bars = standard error. Statistics: 1-way ANOVA, with multiple comparisons
  using Tukey’s correction. n=4. Comprehensive statistical readouts provided in  (Tab=).
  (B) Representative NTA histograms of sEV fractions from Ctl., FRA1KD, and 4EBP1KD
  CAFs; using the NanoSight platform. (C) Cell viability assay of PANC-1 cells at
  48 hours post-treatment with sEVs from Ctl., FRA1KD, or 4EBP1KD CAFs. n=3 biological
  replicates; each replicate consists of 6 technical repeats. All repeats per replicate
  were normalized to the mean of the corresponding PBS-treated condition. Bars=standard
  error. Statistics: 1-way ANOVA, with multiple comparisons using Tukey’s correction.
  * compared to PBS (negative control), # comparing between conditions. Comprehensive
  statistical readouts provided in the  (Tab=). (D) Total amount of metabolites detected
  in sEVs isolated from Ctl. vs. NetG1KD CAFs, normalized to equal protein levels.
  n=3. Bars=standard error. Statistics=unpaired t-test using Welch’s correction. Comprehensive
  statistical readouts provided in  (Tab=). (E) Heat map depicting significant metabolite
  differences in sEVs isolated from control Ctl. vs. NetG1KD CAFs, normalized to median
  sEV metabolite levels. A t-test p-value of <0.01 was used as a cutoff threshold.
  A full readout of metabolomic analysis can be found in  (Tabs=Ctl SEV vs NetG1KD
  sEV, Ctl SEV vs NetG1KD SEV HM). (F) Pathway enrichment analysis summary generated
  by MetaboAnalyst using metabolomics data in (E). The top 25 most significantly represented
  pathways are shown, ranked p-value in descending order of significance.'
