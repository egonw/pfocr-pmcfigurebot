caption: HNF1A negatively regulates type I interferon (IFN) signaling in NASH and
  innate immunity. (A) Enriched pathway RNA-seq reads in normal liver and NASH from
  the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (n = 7 normal livers and 8 NASH). (B)
  Reporter screening of the genes related to liver metabolism indicated HNF1A to be
  a strong suppressor of type I IFN signaling. 293T cells with expression of ISRE
  luciferase reporter and various candidate genes were transfected with poly(I:C)
  for 12 h. (C) mRNA levels of HNF1A, and IFN-β derived from healthy human liver and
  NAFLD/NASH patients. (D) Luciferase activity in 293T cells co-transfected with a
  luciferase reporter for ISRE (ISRE-luc) or IFN-β (IFN-β-luc, 50 ng each) and together
  with empty vector or Myc-HNF1A (0, 200, and 400 ng), followed by treatment with
  SeV or poly(I:C) or no treatment (control), results are relative to Renilla luciferase
  activity. (E) 293T cells transfected with empty vector or Myc-HNF1A for 12 h mRNA
  levels of IFN-β, ISG15, TNFα after SeV infection. (F) Phase-contrast (PH) and fluorescence
  microscopy and flow cytometry detecting the infection of 293T cells transfected
  with empty vector or Myc-HNF1A, and then infected with VSV-eGFP at an MOI of 1.
  Original magnification × 10. Numbers above squares indicate percent cells expressing
  eGFP (infected cells). (G) Immunoblot analysis of p-IRF3 and IRF3 in 293T cells
  transfected with various plasmids for Flag-RIG-I (CARD), Flag-MAVS or Flag-TBK1
  plus Myc-HNF1A.
