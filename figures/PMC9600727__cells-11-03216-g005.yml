caption: Proteomics reveals increased TGF-B signalling and epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition. FA-spheroids treated with 45 μM palmitic acid and 65 μM oleic acid,
  Control-spheroids in standard growth media. (A) Volcano plot depicting proteins
  regulated in FA-treated spheroids (7 days) compared to the Control. The log2 change
  of FA vs. Control is plotted against −log10 q-value calculated using PolyStest.
  The significance threshold (dotted lines) was set to q < 0.05 and a fold change
  of ± 1.2. Red dots-upregulated proteins, blue dots-downregulated proteins. (B) Fragment
  of the resulting pathways enrichment graph obtained using Reactome Pathway Database
  software []. Yellow indicates a statistically significant enriched category. (C)
  Relative TGF-B1 gene expression was measured by qPCR after one, two, four and seven
  days of treatment. * statistically significant difference according to Student’s
  t-test and Holm–Sidak post hoc test, p < 0.05, n = 3. Error bars show the standard
  error of the mean.
