caption: The correlation between ZFP57 expression and radioresistance of PCC was assessed.
  10 pancreatic cancer cases achieving CR+PR and 10 patients achieving SD+PD were
  recruited. Cancerous tissues from these cases were exposed to X-ray irradiation.
  (a) ZFP57 expression in tissues of pancreatic cancer before irradiation as detected
  by RT-qPCR. (b) ZFP57 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues before irradiation
  as detected by WB. (c) Survival curve of TCGA PAAD cases achieving CR+PR and SD+PD
  after radiotherapy based on ZFP57 expression. BxPC3 cells (specifically named parental
  BxPC3-P cells in the present study) were exposed to repeated X-ray irradiations
  to induce the radioresistant cell subtype BxPC3-RR. (d) Survival fractions of BxPC3-P
  and BxPC3-RR cells after exposed to 0, 2, 4, and 8 Gy IR+ and IR− as detected by
  the colony formation assay. (e) ZFP57 expressions in BxPC3-P and BxPC3-RR cells
  after exposed to 8 Gy IR+ and IR− as detected by qPCR. (f) ZFP57 expression in BxPC3-P
  and BxPC3-RR cells after exposed to 8 Gy IR+ and IR− as detected by WB. ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  and ∗∗P < 0.01.
