caption: WNT5B and TGFB1 levels regulated via the JAG1/NOTCH pathway. (A) Significant
  ligand-receptor pairs from PDAC and ECs in the single-cell RNAseq. (B) Bubble plot
  showing the levels of the NOTCH receptor family (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4)
  and ligands (JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL3, DLL4, and DLK2) in different cell types. (C)
  Pearson correlation analysis for WNT5B with JAG1, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2 mRNA levels
  in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (N = 178) from TCGA data. (D) Pearson correlation
  analysis for a CIC biomarker (CD44) with JAG1, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and WNT5B mRNA levels
  in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (N = 178) from TCGA data. (E) Quantification
  of WNT5B and TGFB1 mRNA levels with rhJAG1 in ECs (**P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test).
