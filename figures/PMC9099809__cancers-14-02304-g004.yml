caption: Enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding motifs in the regulatory
  regions of genes modulated by MEOX2 knock-down. (a) All DEGs (both down- and upregulated,
  in both BT273 and BT379 cells, by MEOX2 KD) were subjected to enrichment analysis
  of TF binding motifs using oPOSSUM-3 software. (b) Only downregulated DEGs analyzed
  as in (a). (c) Only upregulated DEGs analyzed as in (a). The names of the significantly
  enriched transcription factor binding motifs (Z score > mean + 2 SD) are shown.
