caption: Genes that are positively associated with NCBP2 are enriched in the cell
  cycle. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes that are positively associated
  with NCBP2; (B) representative images of Blank, NC siRNA-, and NCBP2 siRNA-transfected
  HT-29 cells were analyzed in the cell cycle assay; (C) representative images of
  Blank, NC siRNA-, and NCBP2 siRNA-transfected SW620 cells were analyzed in the cell
  cycle assay. NES, normalized enrichment score; NC, negative control; NCBP2, nuclear
  cap binding protein subunit 2; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
