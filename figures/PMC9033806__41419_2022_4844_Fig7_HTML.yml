  MAPK pathways
caption: a, b Western blot analysis of cell lysates with the indicated antibodies.
  LoVo cells were transfected with different amounts of GXYLT1 and GXYLT1S212* expression
  plasmid and harvested for western blot after 48 h. Bar graphs show quantification
  of NICD, Hes1, and pERK1/2 levels. c RKO cells with indicated transfection were
  harvested for RT-PCR analysis and Western blot analysis to determine the expression
  of GXYLT1 and GXYLT1S212*. d Transwell migration and invasion assays of RKO cells
  with indicated transfection. Graphs show quantification of migrated cells. e Western
  blot analysis of cell lysates with the indicated antibodies. RKO cells with indicated
  transfection were harvested for Western blot after 48 h. Bar graphs show quantification
  of NICD, Hes1, and pERK1/2 levels. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
