caption: 'Glycinergic signaling contributes to pDSGC sensitization. A, Example firing
  rate plot and spiking traces of a dorsal pDSGC responding to test spot stimuli before
  and after induction stimulus in the presence of strychnine. B, Summary plots comparing
  the sensitization indices of spiking activity in control (Ames'' solution, n = 8
  cells from 3 mice) and in the presence of strychnine (n = 15 cells from 5 mice).
  For On spiking: control, *p = 0.016; strychnine, p = 0.95; control versus strychnine,
  *p = 0.022. For Off spiking: control, *p = 0.012; strychnine, p = 0.18; control
  versus strychnine, *p = 0.018. For sustained spiking: control, *p = 0.014; strychnine,
  p = 0.16; control versus strychnine, *p = 0.047. C, Example PSP traces of a dorsal
  pDSGC during test spot stimulus before (black) and after (red) induction stimulus
  in the presence of strychnine. D, Summary plots comparing the sensitization indices
  of PSPs in control (n = 10 cells from 4 mice) versus in the presence of strychnine
  (n = 10 cells from 3 mice). For On PSP: control, ***p < 0.001; strychnine, p = 0.12;
  control versus strychnine, ***p < 0.001. For Off PSP: control, *p = 0.015; strychnine,
  p = 0.43; control versus strychnine, *p = 0.017. For sustained PSP: control, ***p
  < 0.001; strychnine, p = 0.14; control versus strychnine, **p = 0.0011. E, Example
  EPSC traces during test spot stimulus before (black) and after (red) induction stimulus
  in the presence of strychnine. F, Comparison of the EPSC sensitization indices in
  control (n = 8 cells from 6 mice) versus in the presence of strychnine (n = 15 cells
  from 8 mice). For On EPSC: control, *p = 0.033; strychnine, *p = 0.011; control
  versus strychnine, p = 0.93. For Off EPSC: control, *p = 0.040; strychnine, p =
  0.76; control versus strychnine, *p = 0.037. For sustained EPSC: control, **p =
  0.0027; strychnine, *p = 0.011; control versus strychnine, *p = 0.010. G, Comparison
  of the On IPSC sensitization indices in control (n = 7 cells from 3 mice) versus
  in the presence of strychnine (n = 9 cells from 6 mice). Control, *p = 0.016; strychnine,
  **p = 0.0036; control versus strychnine, p = 0.076. H, A mechanistic model of sensitization
  in the Off pathway of the direction-selective circuit. Schematic diagrams show side
  views of the laminar organization of bipolar cells (BCs), glycinergic amacrine cells
  (ACs), and On-Off DSGCs in the IPL. In the Off pathway, the presynaptic glycinergic
  AC adapts and disinhibits Off BC after induction stimulus. Therefore, the DSGC Off
  responses are enhanced because of higher glutamate release from Off BCs.'
