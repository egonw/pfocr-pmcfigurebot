caption: 'Effect of Ukgansan against MPTP-induced behavioral dysfunction in a mouse
  PD model. The pole tests were conducted 3 and 7 days after the last MPTP injection.
  Time to turn downward completely ((a) and (c); T-turn) and arrive at the floor ((b)
  and (d); T-LA) were recorded with the cut-off limit at 60 s. Values are indicated
  as the mean ± S.E.M. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗p < 0.01 compared with the control group, #p
  < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 compared with the MPTP-only treated group.'
