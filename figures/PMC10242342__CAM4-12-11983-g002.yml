caption: Fibronectin plays critical role in ITGA5‐mediated angiogenesis in vitro.
  (A) Correlation analysis between ITGA5 expression and FN1 in cervical cancer by
  GEPIA2 based on TCGA. Pearson correlation test. (B) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  staining of FN1 in HeLa cells with fibronectin substrate coated (+fibronectin) or
  control. Scale bar, 50 μm. (C) qRT‐PCR for the mRNA level of FN1 of HeLa and SiHa
  cells coated with fibronectin substrate (+fibronectin) or control. Four independent
  experiments. Bar, SD; Student's t‐test. (D, E) Representative images of tube formation
  assay and 3D spheroid sprouting assay of HUVECs stimulated with conditional medium
  form HeLa cells with fibronectin substrate coated (+fibronectin) or control and
  conditional medium from HeLa cells transfected with siFN1 or negative control siRNA
  (NC), respectively. Scale bar, 50 μm. The representative sprout is marked by green
  line. The histograms show the number of nodes and junctions of the tube formation
  assay and the average sprout length of 3D spheroid sprouting assay of three independent
  experiments. Bar, SD; Student's t‐test. (F) Western Blotting assay show the expression
  of FN1, AKT, p‐AKT, and VEGFA in HeLa and SiHa cells transfected with siFN1 or NC.
  (G) The schematic figure shows that ITGA5 promotes angiogenesis in cervical cancer
  by AKT/VEGFA axis and Fibronectin plays critical role in this pathway. *p < 0.05;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
