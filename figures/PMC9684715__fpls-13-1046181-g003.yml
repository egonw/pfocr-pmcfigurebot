caption: Enhanced plant resistance by JR48. (A,B) Bacterial population in Arabidopsis
  leaves. Pst DC3000 (A) and Xcc 8004 (B) were infiltrated into leaves of wild-type
  Arabidopsis Col-0 pre-treated with sterile water (control) or JR48. Bacterial population
  was measured at the indicated time points (mean ± SD; n (number of leaves) ≥ 6;
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). Experiments were repeated in triplicate.
  (C) P. capsici inoculation on Arabidopsis. Zoospore suspensions of LT263 were dripped
  on leaves of Col-0 pre-treated with control or JR48. Infected leaves were photographed
  under UV light. The relative biomass of P. capsici was measured by qRT-PCR. Data
  presented are means ± SD (n ≥ 16), ** indicates significant differences (P < 0.01,
  Student’s t-test). This experiment was repeated at least three times with similar
  results. (D) B. cinerea inoculation on Arabidopsis. Mycelial plugs of B05.10 were
  inoculated on leaves of Col-0 pre-treated with control or JR48. Inoculated leaves
  were photographed under natural light at and lesion area was measured. Values are
  presented as means ± SD (n ≥ 16) calculated from three independent biological replicates
  (ns, not significant, Student’s t-test).
