caption: DCAF13 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in LUAD. A.
  DCAF13 mRNA expression by GEPIA2. B-G. DCAF13 mRNA expression, promoter methylation
  level, and protein level by UALCAN. Differences in significance were marked (Mann-Whitney
  U test). H and I. DCAF13 protein expression levels were detected in a tissue microarray
  by IHC (Mann-Whitney U test). The scale bar is marked as shown. H, quantification
  analysis of DCAF13 expression in grade. I, representative DCAF13 immunohistochemical
  staining. J and K. DCAF13 is highly expressed in fresh clinical LUAD tissue specimens
  by Western blotting (K, paired t-test). A, Adjacent paraneoplastic tissue; T, Tumor
  tissue. L-M. Association between DCAF13 mRNA expression and prognosis in TCGA LUAD
  samples by Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test). L (OS), M (DFS). N. Association
  between DCAF13 mRNA expression and prognosis in lung cancer by KM-plotter database
  (log-rank test). Data are presented as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  and **** p < 0.0001
