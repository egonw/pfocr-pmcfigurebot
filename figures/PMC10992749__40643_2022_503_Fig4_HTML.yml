caption: Deletion of pfkB2 promotes l-ornithine accumulation in C. glutamicum SO26.
  A Sugar consumption of C. glutamicum SO30 cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. Black
  square represents fructose, red cycle represents glucose, and blue triangle represents
  sucrose. B l-Ornithine production curves of strain C. glutamicum SO26 (solid black
  square) and SO31 (with pfkB2 deletion, hollow red cycle) cultivated on glucose.
  C Cell growth curves of strain C. glutamicum SO26 (solid black square) and SO31
  (hollow red cycle) cultivated on glucose. D Sugar consumption of C. glutamicum SO31
  cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. Black square represents fructose, red cycle
  represents glucose, and blue triangle represents sucrose. E Sugar consumption of
  C. glutamicum SO32 cultivated on glucose plus sucrose. Black square represents fructose,
  red cycle represents glucose, and blue triangle represents sucrose. Data are averages
  and standard deviations from three independent experiments
article_title: Enhanced l-ornithine production from glucose and sucrose via manipulation
  of the fructose metabolic pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
