caption: 'Treatment with DAC in combination with DEX impairs genes involved in promoting
  distant metastasis(A and B) Left panel: Transcriptome data from the DEX+DAC and
  DAC groups were further analyzed using GSEA based on the latest MSigDB database
  for each collection. The GSEA revealed the enrichment of genes associated with the
  Gene Ontology pathway: Collagen catabolic process (A) and KEGG pathway: Cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction (B). Left: Significantly DEGs (fold change > 2) are highlighted
  in different colors (red for upregulated genes and blue for downregulated genes)
  with p < 0.05. Right: A heatmap showing the dynamic expression of the core enriched
  genes involved in these two signaling pathways.(C) RT-qPCR analyses validated the
  DEGs between the DEX+DAC and DAC groups identified from the RNA-seq data. MDA-MB-231
  and HCC-1395 cells were treated with 100 nM DEX alone or in combination with 10 μM
  DAC for 6 days. The expression of MMP1, 3, 9, 13, and IL-1β was analyzed. Data shown
  here represent the normalized means ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates). ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s post hoc test was used for the statistical analysis (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p <
  0.01; and ∗∗∗p < 0.001).(D) Top: Schematic diagram of 4X NF-κB-responsive firefly
  luciferase reporter plasmid. Bottom: MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the
  NF-κB-responsive firefly luciferase reporter and GFP as the internal control for
  24 h. Cells were then incubated with DMSO, DAC (1 μM), or DEX (100 nM) for another
  24 h. The data shown here represent the normalized luciferase activity ±SD (n =
  3 biological replicates). ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used for the
  statistical analysis (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01).'
