caption: Metabolic labeling of cellular N-glycans with radioactive fucose.A, exemplary
  representative HPLC chromatograms of digested N-glycans isolated from indicated
  cell lines. The fluorescence signal from the 2-AB-labeled N-glycans (black solid
  lines) was overlaid with the radioactivity data (red dots and solid lines). Total
  radioactivity of the fucosylated N-glycans normalized for the amount of the starting
  material (total protein) from HEK293T (B) and HepG2 (C) cell lines. Percentage of
  the radioactive fucose incorporated into the fucosylated N-glycans isolated from
  HEK293T (D) and HepG2 (E) cell lines. To calculate the values, the sum of radioactivity
  measured in the HPLC fractions corresponding to the fucosylated species was divided
  by the total radioactivity of the fucose added to the culture medium. Comparison
  of the relative incorporation of the radioactive fucose derived from the salvage
  pathway in the wildtype (F) and SLC35C1 knockout (G) HEK293T cells. H, total radioactivity
  of the GDP-fucose normalized for total number of HEK293T cells. ∗p < 0.05 as determined
  using two-tailed unpaired t test with Welch’s correction. Data are presented as
  mean ± SD. Each sample was run in three biological replicates. 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide;
  ISTD, internal standard (GDP-glucose); ns, not significant.
