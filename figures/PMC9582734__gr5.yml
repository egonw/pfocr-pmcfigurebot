caption: Genes classified as under intensified regulated expression are involved in
  the dexamethasone responsive immune regulation. (A) Enrichment analysis (Over-representation
  analysis, ORA) of Top 10 Reactome Pathways amongst the genes significantly upregulated
  by Dex (log2FC ≥ 0.58, p adj ≤ 0.05). The size of the dot represents the number
  of DEGs enriched in respective pathway in RNA-seq data. The enrichment ratio represents
  the number of enriched DEGs relative to the total number of genes in the respective
  pathway, and the color of the dot refers to the significance of enrichment (FDR).
  (B) STRING protein network analysis of significantly upregulated DEGs classified
  as intensified regulated, with the top four identified STRING subnetworks/clusters
  identified using Markov clustering (MCL). The surrounding donut color represents
  the enrichment categories plotted in (C). (C) The top four enriched categories (GO
  Biological Process, GO Molecular Function, and KEGG Pathway) in the subnetworks
  (B). *** FDR ≤ 0.001, was considered statistically significant. (D) Enrichment analysis
  (ORA) of Top 10 Reactome Pathways amongst genes significantly downregulated by dexamethasone
  (log2FC ≤ -0.58, p adj ≤ 0.05). The size of the dot represents the number of DEGs
  enriched in the respective pathway. The enrichment ratio represents the number of
  enriched DEGs relative to the total number of genes in the respective pathway, and
  the color of the dot refers to the significance of enrichment (FDR). (E) STRING
  protein network analysis of significantly downregulated DEGs classified as intensified
  regulated. Top four identified STRING subnetworks/clusters using Markov clustering
  (MCL). Surrounding donut colors represent the enrichment categories plotted in (F).
  (F) The top four enriched categories (GO Biological Process, KEGG Pathway, and Reactome
  Pathway) identified in the subnetworks (E). *** FDR ≤ 0.001 was considered statistically
  significant.
