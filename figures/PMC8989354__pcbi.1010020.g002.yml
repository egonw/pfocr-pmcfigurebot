figure_title: Heatmap of the coefficients of the Pearson correlation matrix between
  the variables survival time, the eigengene of the gene expression values, and the
  gene expression values within the pathway ‘Metabolism of folate and pterines” for
  samples from diseased patients
caption: We sorted the genes in the expression matrix by their contribution to the
  eigensample and encompassed them with a dotted line. The patients’ survival time
  both correlates and anti-correlates with the different genes. However, the eigengene
  captures the covariational trend within the expression data and correlates well
  with the patients’ survival time.
