caption: 'Schematic illustration of bacterial nitrogen metabolism. The main nitrogen
  sources, their uptake, and assimilation routes are depicted, as well as representative
  example of proteins involved in these processes. Enzyme systems for ammonia assimilation
  are shown in detail. GS: glutamine synthetase; GOGAT: glutamine-2-oxoglutarate-aminotransferase;
  GDH: glutamate dehydrogenase. Red arrows: GS/GOGAT pathway; light gray arrow: GDH
  pathway; black arrows: other metabolic routes; dark gray cylinders: transporters
