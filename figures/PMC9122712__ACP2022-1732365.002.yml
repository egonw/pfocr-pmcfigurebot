caption: Overexpression of miR-585-3p inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of OC cells. (a) CCK-8 detects the OD value of SKOV3 cells transfected with miR-585-3p
  inhibitor. (b) The cell clone assays detect the number of cell clones of SKOV3 cells
  transfected with miR-585-3p inhibitor. (c) Scratch wound healing assays detect the
  scratch distance after SKOV3 cells are transfected with miR-585-3p inhibitor. (d)
  Transwell assays detect the number of cell migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells
  after transfection of miR-585-3p inhibitor. (e) CCK-8 detects the OD value of SW626
  cells transfected with miR-585-3p mimic. (f) The cell clone assays detect the number
  of cell clones of SW626 cells transfected with miR-585-3p mimic. (g) Scratch wound
  healing test detects the scratch distance after SW626 cells are transfected with
  miR-585-3p mimic. (h) Transwell assays detect the number of cell migration and invasion
  of SW626 cells after transfection of miR-585-3p mimic. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P
