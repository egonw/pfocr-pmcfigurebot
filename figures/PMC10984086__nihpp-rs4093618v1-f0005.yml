figure_title: The T-cell depleted DZ microenvironment exhibits inactivity of the cGAS-STING
  pathway
caption: 'A-C, Representative microphotographs, spatial plots and quantitative analyses
  showing cGAS/dsDNA interactions (red signal) detected by fluorescent in situ proximity
  ligation assay (n GCs = 10) and showing scattered elements in the LZ regions. Original
  magnification, x200 and x630 (insets). Scale bars, 100 μm and 10 μm. D-E, Representative
  microphotographs, spatial plots and quantitative analyses of STING (brown signal)
  and CD3 (pink signal) double-marker immunostaining highlighting a different spatial
  distribution of STING and CD3 in DZ and LZ (n GCs = 20). Original magnification,
  x100. Scale bar, 200 μm. F-G, Nearest neighbor distance of STING to CD3 and STING
  to Negative cells showing the proximity of STING to CD3 cells (n GCs = 20). Statistical
  analysis: two-tailed unpaired Mann-Whitney test (C, E, G). Mean ± standard error
  shown; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.H-K, Expression
  of “DNA and RNA sensing” (H), “IL6 signaling” (J), and “NF-kB” (K) genes in DZ and
  LZ ROIs. The left bar indicates the significant DEGs between DZ and LZ ROIs (orange).'
