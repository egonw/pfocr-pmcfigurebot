caption: Analysis of the 856 of 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of OsARF17-dependent
  genes were suppressed in 17cas-2-1-RSMV vs. ZH11-RSMV. (A) Venn diagram illustrating
  the overlapping of down-regulated 856 DEGs in ZH11–RSMV vs. ZH11, 17cas-2-1-RSMV
  vs. ZH11-RSMV and 17cas-2-1 vs. ZH11. (B) Hierarchical clustering of 856 DEGs in
  (A) based on the log2 fold change in transcript levels in ZH11 and OsARF17 mutant
  plants under mock or RSMV inoculation. The hierarchical clustering analysis was
  performed on the FPKM values of all tested genes. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analyses
  of 856-down genes (labelled in red) in (A). (D) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
  of 856-down genes (labelled in red) in (A). “Rich factor” shows the ratio between
  the number of DEGs and the total genes in this pathway. All differentially expressed
  genes were selected using cut-off p-value < 0.05 and fold-change > 2 compared with
  controls. Data were collected from three biological replicates, each containing
  a pool of three plants.
