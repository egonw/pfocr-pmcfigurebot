caption: The expression of genes related to the PPAR signaling pathway in BRCA and
  univariate Cox regression analysis. (a) The heat map shows the expression of genes
  related to the PPAR signaling pathway in BRCA. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P <
  0.001. (b) The forest plot shows the results of univariate Cox analysis of PPAR
  signaling pathway-related genes in BRCA. (c) PPAR signaling pathway-related molecular
  interaction network diagram.
