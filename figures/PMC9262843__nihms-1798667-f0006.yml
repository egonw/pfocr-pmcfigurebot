figure_title: Reduction in m-TOR signaling and inducing necroptosis pathway in residual
  tumors following combination treatment with dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors OSI-027 and
  bromodomain inhibitor RVX-208
caption: A. Western blots and B. IHC data show that RVX-208 treatment reduces BRD4-dependent
  acetylation of H3K27ac histones (scale bar-50μm). C. Western blot analysis of p-AKT/AKT,
  p-mTOR/mTOR, p-p70S6Kp70S6K, p-4EBP1/4EBP1 and cyclin D1 in tumor lysates. D. IHC
  of p-mTOR in tumors treated with either vehicle or therapeutic drug as indicated
  (scale bar-50μm). E. Immunofluorescence staining of p-MLKL (red)/p-RIPK3 (green)
  in the residual tumors treated with vehicle (control), RVX-208, OSI-027 or OSI-027+RVX-208
  (scale bar-50μm). Nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue). Please see  and  for uncropped
  images. p<0.01** show significant levels. F. Flow diagram depicting effectiveness
  of combination treatment of RMS xenograft tumor-bearing mice with bromodomain inhibitor,
  RVX208, and dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors OSI-027 or PP242.
