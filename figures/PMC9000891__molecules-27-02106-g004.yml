caption: 6-Gingerol treatment inhibited metastasis by suppressing the HIF1α/HSP90
  pathway under normoxia. H460 and H1299 cells were treated with 6-gingerol (100 µM)
  for 24 h. (A) Whole-cell lysates were analyzed with an antibody array kit. (B) Whole-cell
  lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HIF-1α, anti-HSP90, and anti-GAPDH
  antibodies. (C) Confocal images demonstrating the subcellular localization of HIF-1α
  (green) and the HSP90 (red) complex after treatment with 6-gingerol are shown. Nuclei
  were stained with DAPI (blue) (D) The migration of 6-gingerol-treated cells was
  assessed by using a wound healing assay. (E,F) Expression of the metastasis-related
  proteins MMP-9 was detected by using Western blotting. The data are presented as
  the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, compared to untreated cells.
