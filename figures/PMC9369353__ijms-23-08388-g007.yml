caption: Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 in rNfCB-stimulated BV-2
  microglial cells. To analyze phosphorylation level and translocation of p65, BV-2
  microglial cells were treated with rNfCB (100 µg/mL) with or without pre-treatment
  with MG132. Cytoplasmic proteins and nuclear proteins were extracted from the cells
  separately. Phosphorylation of p65 was analyzed by immunoblot using a specific antibody
  for each protein. β-actin and Lamin A/C were used as internal controls. Fold-change
  means relative density change of P-p65 compared to negative control without treatment
  of rNfCB and inhibitor.
