caption: TREM2 regulates the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and affects CXCL3 expression.
  A, The differential gene analysis schematic derived from transcriptome sequencing
  of tissue samples obtained from developing the DMM model in WT and TREM2-KO mice.
  B, Heatmap. C-D, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the biological functions of
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs). E-F, Genes and Genomes Encyclopedia (KEGG)
  analyzes the biological functions of DEGs. The red highlighted area is the PI3K/AKT
  and NF-κB signaling pathways identified and paid attention to. G, Using Western
  blotting detects PI3K/AKT and NF-κB (p65) signaling pathway activation levels. The
  endogenous control used was β-actin. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared to the WT-DMM
  group.
