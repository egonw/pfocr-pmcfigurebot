caption: 'Naringenin significantly inhibited pyroptosis and apoptosis induced by renal
  I/R injury in mice. (a) The levels of caspase-1 activity in the I/R group exhibited
  obvious reduction after naringenin treatment. (b–d) Naringenin significantly inhibited
  the mRNA expression of pyroptosis-related markers such as NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1
  in renal I/R injury. (e, f) Renal I/R-generated pyroptosis was obviously ameliorated
  by naringenin application as evidenced by the decreased protein expression of NLRP3,
  ASC, caspase-1, GSDMD-N, caspase-11, and IL-1β in extracted kidney tissues. (g)
  The usage of naringenin remarkably restrained caspase-3 activity in renal I/R injury.
  (h) Western blot analysis utilized in protein detection of kidney tissue was selected
  to detect the protein levels of Bcl-2, BAX, and cleaved caspase-3 in the four groups.
  Values measured during animal experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3 (three
  times measurement). ∗P < 0.05, compared with the Sham group; #P < 0.05, relative
  to the NS+I/R group.'
