caption: Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG)‐induced pyroptotic requires PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. (a) HCT116 cells were treated with SDG (50 μmol/L) for 24 h,
  cell protein was then harvested to detect PI3K, p‐PI3K, AKT, p‐AKT, BAX, and GAPDH
  by western blot. (b) HCT116 cells were treated with SDG or cotreated with 740Y‐P
  (50 μg/ml) and SDG (50 μmol/L), as indicated by the concentration shown, for 24 h.
  After treatment, the release of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) from HCT116 cells was
  measured by ELISA Kit. (c) HCT116 cells were pretreated with SDG (50 μmol/L) in
  the absence or presence of 740Y‐P (50 μg/ml) for 24 h. After treatment, cell protein
  was then harvested to detect the expression of AKT, p‐AKT, BAX, cleavage of GSDMD,
  and caspase‐1 by western blot. All the data are presented as the mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. ∗p < .05, ∗∗p < .01 versus control using one‐way analysis
  of variance. SD, standard deviation.
