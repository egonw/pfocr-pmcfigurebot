caption: Cell cycle arrest of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) induced by sea
  cucumber saponins. (a) The human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 and the mouse TNBC cell
  line 4 T1 were treated with 0.5 and 1 μM of stichloroside C2 (STC2) for 24 h. The
  cells were digested and collected, and the cycle changes of the two cells were detected
  by flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI). (b) Prism 8.0 was used for statistical
  analysis of the experimental data, which were expressed as the mean ± SEM of three
  independent experiments. ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to the control group. (c) MDA-MB-231
  and 4 T1 cells were treated with different concentrations of STC2 (0.25, 0.5, and
  1 μM) for 6 h, and the expression of cycle-related proteins in MDA-MB-231 and 4 T1
  cells was detected by western blot. (d) Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of
  three independent experiments, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared to
  the control group.
