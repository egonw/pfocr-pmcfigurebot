caption: Interferon pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib enhances ZIKV replication and induces
  cytopathic effects in ZIKV-infected hVECs. (A) Different concentrations of ruxolitinib
  were used to treat ZIKV-UG-infected VK2 cells. DMSO treatment was used as a control.
  At day 7 post-infection, images were recorded using a BioTek LionHeart FX Automated
  Microscope. The red arrows indicate CPE formation. Cell viability for uninfected
  (B) and infected (C) VK2E6E7 cells treated with ruxolitinib was quantified by subjecting
  the cultured cells to a PrestoBlue assay. The absorbance of each well was quantified
  using a microplate reader. The relative absorbance was calculated by subtracting
  the absorbance of the tested wells from the absorbance reads from the culture media
  alone. The t-test was used to measure p- values. ns, not significant.
