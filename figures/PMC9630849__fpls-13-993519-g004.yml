caption: Annotation of metabolites using the KEGG pathway, HMDB categories, and LIPID
  MAPS. The horizontal coordinates represent the number of metabolites in all three
  figures. (A) The vertical axis represents the annotated KEGG pathways, and the graph
  shows the number of metabolites annotated in each secondary classification under
  the pathway primary classification. (B) The vertical axis represents the annotated
  HMDB categories, and the graph shows the number of metabolites annotated to the
  secondary categories (Super Class) in the HMDB. (C) The vertical coordinate represents
  the annotated LIPID MAPS lipid categories, and the graph shows the number of (lipid)
  metabolites annotated to the main hierarchical category (Main_Class) under the seven
  major lipid categories (Categories) in LIPID MAPS.
