caption: 'Metabolomic analysis of high glucose environment. (A) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) score plot of 40mM glucose groups and control groups. The X-axis
  and Y-axis were labeled with PC1 (the first principal component) and PC2 (the second
  principal component), respectively. 40mM glucose groups and control groups were
  scattered into two different regions. One data point stands for one sample: red
  dots, controls; purple triangles, treatments. (B) Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant
  Analysis (OPLS-DA) score plot from the 40mM glucose group and the control group,
  red dots represent controls, while purple triangles represent treatments. (C) Validation
  of the OPLS-DA model, green dot, R2; blue square, Q2. R2 = 0.988 and Q2 = 0.951,
  after 200 permutations. (D) Clustering heat map of significantly changed metabolites:
  Each sample was represented as a column (10 controls and 11 treats), and each metabolite
  was represented as a row. Metabolite abundance was represented by color: deep red,
  highest; deep blue, lowest; white, 0. (E) Functional enrichment (p-values) and pathway
  topology analysis (pathway impact) correlated with embryo development inhibited
  by high glucose. The x-axis represented the pathway impact, and the y-axis represented
  the pathway enrichment. Larger sizes and darker colors respectively represented
  the pathway enrichment and high pathway impact values.'
