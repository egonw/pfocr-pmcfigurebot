caption: CYP27C1 expression in different human lung cancer cell lines. (A) Relative
  mRNA expression levels of CYP27C1 in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, and
  human lung cancer cells were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.
  Results comparing BEAS-2B with other cell lines were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed
  T test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; n.s., p > 0.05. (B,C) Protein
  expression level of CYP27C1 in BEAS-2B, and human lung cancer cells were detected
  by immunoblot analysis. Grey scales of the bands were analyzed by Gel-Pro ANALYZER.
  Results were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed T test comparing BEAS-2B with other
  cell lines. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; n.s., p > 0.05.
