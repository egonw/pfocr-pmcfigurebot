figure_title: MiR-375 regulated enzalutamide resistance by targeting the PTPN4-STAT3
  signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo
caption: 'CCK-8 assays were conducted to test enzalutamide resistance of DU145 and
  PC-3 cells in response to a, b stably upregulated expression of miR-375, c, d stable
  knockdown with miR-375 sponge, e, f overexpression of miR-375 and/or PTPN4, g, h
  suppression of miR-375 and/or PTPN4, and i, j the use of miR-e-375i. k A flow chart
  showing the in vivo experimental design. l Tumor volume during follow-up for 4 weeks.
  m Representative images of tumors in nude mice. n Final tumor weight, o final tumor
  volume. ENZ: enzalutamide.'
