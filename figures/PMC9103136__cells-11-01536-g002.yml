caption: Hypoglycemia and impaired hepatic glucose homeostasis caused by liver-specific
  NDRG3 ablation. (A) Blood glucose levels of 2–4-month-old wild-type and Ndrg3 LKO
  mice determined ad libitum (Feeding, n = 12) or after fasting for 15 h (Fasting,
  n = 7). (B) Glucose tolerance test (GTT) (left), and AUC (area under the curve)
  for GTT (right). Male mice were fasted overnight and then injected with glucose
  at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight by intraperitoneal administration (n = 5 per group).
  (C–E) Levels of the metabolic intermediates in glycogen degradation pathway measured
  from liver tissues of wild-type and Ndrg3 LKO mice at increasing ages. Free glucose
  (C), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P; D), and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P; E). (F) Scheme
  for the hepatic glycogen metabolism. Changes in metabolite levels in the liver of
  Ndrg3 LKO mice relative to wild-type are shown as arrows. Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM. p-values were calculated using two-tailed Student’s t-test (A,C–E).
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. wild mice.
