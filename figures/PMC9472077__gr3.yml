caption: 'Locating the first critical pauses for PRE folding.A, experimental overview
  for mapping the first critical pause (“pause 1”) in the PRE folding pathway. B,
  pause mapping. RNA sequencing ladder generated using corresponding 3′-deoxyNTP.
  Time-course samples were run alongside sequencing ladder for precise identification
  of the pause locations. Pause band numbering denotes nucleotide position on the
  PRE. All pause bands disappear after 5 min with saturating NTP (“chase” lane), indicating
  these do not result from arrested transcription complexes and indeed represent transient
  PECs. The asterisk (∗) denotes a pause RNA band downstream of the sequential pauses
  most likely introduced by shortening of the downstream DNA. The splice borders denote
  samples that were not adjacent to one another in the original gel image. C, sequence
  comparison of PRE sequential pauses to the consensus elemental pause. Top panel,
  the ePEC structure (Protein Data Bank ID: 6BJS; representation adapted from reference
  ) (, ) is shown above the consensus elemental pause sequence logo identified via
  NET-seq (), represented as the nucleotide sequence of the nontemplate DNA. The ePEC
  structure and sequence logo have the following color scheme: upstream fork junction
  (usFJ, blue), hybrid (red), downstream fork junction (dsFJ, green), and downstream
  DNA (dsDNA, purple). Numbering corresponds to position relative to the RNA 3′ end
  at the RNAP active site. Bottom panel, PRE pause sequences with color scheme to
  match that used for the pause consensus to facilitate sequence comparison. D, synchronized
  single-round in vitro transcription from the alx promoter to visualize the sequential
  pauses. Transcription elongation reactions were performed with one NTP at a limiting
  concentration (20 μM) to slow pause escape, permitting visualization of each pause
  in the sequential series. Each pause RNA band is denoted with an asterisk (∗). Radiolabeled
  RNA samples were separated on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. ePEC, elemental
  paused elongation complex; PEC, paused elongation complex; PRE, pH-responsive element.'
