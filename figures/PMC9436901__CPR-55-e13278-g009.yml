caption: 'TP inhibits IgA1‐induced HMC proliferation. (A) Immunofluorescence of PCNA
  and cyclin D1 in HMCs. Bars = 50 μm, All images ×400. Representative western blots
  (B) and quantitative analysis (C) of PCNA and cyclin D1 in HMCs. (D) Cell viability
  was assessed by CCK8 assay. (E,F) Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle in HMCs.
  The proliferation index is calculated as the sum of the percentages of cells in
  the S phase and G2/M phase. All data presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 vs. Control, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. IgA1.'
article_title: Triptolide promotes autophagy to inhibit mesangial cell proliferation
  in IgA nephropathy via the CARD9/p38 MAPK pathway.
