caption: 'Inhibitory effect of KRG-WE on activation of AP-1-related signaling pathway.
  (A–E) Total and phospho-protein levels of ERK1/2, p38, JNK, MEK1/2, MEK3/6, MKK4,
  and β-actin in CdSO4–treated A549 cell lysates were determined by immunoblotting
  analysis. (F and G) Effect of KRG-WE on the mRNA expression of inflammatory genes,
  IL-8 and IL-6 (F), and AP-1 subunits, c-Fos and c-Jun (G) in CdSO4–treated A549 cells
  using qPCR. Data is expressed as the mean ± SD of an experiments done with 3 biological
  replicates. ###: P < 0.001 compared to normal group, and ∗: P < 0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01,
