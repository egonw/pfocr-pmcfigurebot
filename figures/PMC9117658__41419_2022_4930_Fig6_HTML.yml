figure_title: tRF-Val regulates the MDM2/p53 pathway by promoting the interaction
  between EEF1A1 and MDM2
caption: A, B IF assay showed that tRF-Val promoted the colocalization of EEF1A1 and
  MDM2 in the nucleus of AGS and MKN-45 cells. The scale bar, 50 μm. C Co-IP assay
  showed that the amount of MDM2 co-immunoprecipitated by anti-EEF1A1 antibody increased
  in a gradient with the increase of tRF-Val transfection concentration in AGS cells.
  D WB assay proved that tRF-Val overexpression significantly promoted the nuclear
  localization of MDM2 and p-MDM2. E tRF-Val overexpression significantly promoted
  the ubiquitination of p53. F, G WB rescue experiments showed that the regulatory
  effect of tRF-Val on p-MDM2 and its downstream target molecules could be reversed
  by the knockdown and overexpression of EEF1A1 in AGS and MKN-45 cells. Data were
  shown as mean ± SD. (Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001).

  inhibits apoptosis by targeting EEF1A1 in gastric cancer.
