caption: Positive and negative motility response defines transcriptionally distinct
  subsets of cancer cells. (A) Venn diagram illustrates overlap and uniqueness of
  gene expression signatures induced by lymphatic intensities of wall shear stress
  (WSS) in PC3 prostate cancer cells and two subsets of breast cancer cells defined
  by increased (positive) or decreased (negative) migration response under flow. The
  positive versus negative comparison contrasts the two breast cancer subsets. (B)
  Differentially expressed genes are depicted by volcano plot with cutoffs demarcated
  by dashed lines and color at p‐value < 0.05 and −1 < log2 fold change < 1. (C) Transcripts
  of genes representative of those regulated in distinct directions in the breast
  cancer subsets. (D) GSEA of top 20 KEGG pathways show broad changes in adhesion,
  cytokine signaling, and cytoskeleton. Contrast reflects change relative to static
  conditions such that orange bars indicate pathways upregulated in positive breast
  cancer responders exposed to flow relative to negative responders exposed to flow.
  Blue bars depict pathways predicted to be more highly downregulated in positive
  responders relative to negative responders. Prostate cancer pathways reflect WSS
  versus static conditions. (E) Expression of HIPPO pathway components are shown to
  indicate fold change in positive versus negative breast cancer comparison in the
  left half of each split node and prostate on the right of each node. Color scale
  legends indicate fold change in gene expression following 6 h of WSS in breast or
  prostate
