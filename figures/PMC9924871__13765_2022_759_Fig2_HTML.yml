caption: Baicalein triggered ERS in GC cells. A Cell morphology observed under a microscope;
  B Expression levels of ERS markers Grp78 and CHOP determined using Western blot;
  C Intracellular Ca2 + levels measured by Fluo-3 AM fluorescent probes; D Intercellular
  Ca2 + levels measured by flow cytometry. Cell experiment was duplicated thrice,
  and data were exhibited as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was adopted for comparisons
  among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Baicalein facilitates gastric cancer cell apoptosis by triggering endoplasmic
  reticulum stress via repression of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
