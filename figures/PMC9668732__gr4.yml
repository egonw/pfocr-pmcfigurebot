caption: Role of eIF2α S52 and PERK. A, pathway immunoblotting analysis in mutant
  eIF2α cells. 3T3 WT cells or 3T3 cells with a biallelic point mutation at serine
  52 to alanine (Eif2s1 S52A) were cultured in media with Leu (+) or lacking Leu (−)
  for 4 h without or with GCN2-IN-6 (10 μM), torin-1 (1 μM) rapamycin (1 μM) coincident
  with amino acid starvation. Data are depicted as representative one of two independent
  experiments. B, pathway immunoblotting analysis for GCN2- versus PERK-ISR specificity.
  3T3 cells were cultured in media with Leu (Ctrl) or lacking Leu (-) for 4 h in the
  absence or presence of 1 μM thapsigargin. Cells were treated additionally with exogenous
  leucine, GCN2-IN-6 (10 μM), rapamycin (1 μM), or torin-1 (1 μM). PERK activation
  was detected with a polyclonal antibody to T980, required for kinase activation
  or an antibody to total PERK, which detects the mobility shift associated with PERK
  activation. Note that torin-1 does not inhibit PERK activation, controlled by the
  inhibition of p-4EBP1 T36/45, while GCN2-IN-6 inhibits PERK activation. Data are
  depicted as one of two independent experiments. ISR, integrated stress response.
