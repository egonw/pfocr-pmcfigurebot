caption: qRT-PCR analysis of expression of 10 DEGs. Line charts are from the transcriptome
  data results (FPKM value). Column charts are from the qRT-PCR results (relative
  expression fold change). Bars represent means ± SD (N = 3). Using an independent
  sample t-test, statistically significant differences and extremely significant differences
  were defined as (*) p < 0.05 and (**) p < 0.01 compared to the P-OP50 group, respectively.
