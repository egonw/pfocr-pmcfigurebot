caption: 'Effects of LPS on TLR4-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response in differentiated
  HMGECs. (A) Expression of TLR4 in human MG specimens detected by immunohistochemical
  staining. Scale bar: 100 µm. (B) Expression of TLR4 in HMGECs depicted by immunofluorescence
  staining. Scale bar: 20 µm. The HMGECs were treated with differentiated medium for
  48 hours followed by LPS (10 µg/mL) for 8 hours. (C) Representative protein bands
  of TLR4 and MyD88. (D, E) Quantitative intensity of TLR4 and MyD88. (F) Transcriptional
  levels of TLR4 and cytokines. (G) Secreted levels of cytokines. n = 3. *Significantly
  different from control, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  factor.'
