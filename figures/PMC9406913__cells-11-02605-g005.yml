caption: Pathway analysis of root, root AC-DC and mucilage upon induced defense response
  with PEP-13. In root AC-DC (A), mucilage (B) and roots (C), pathways are represented
  according to their impact value (pathway impact) and their p-value (−log10(p)).
  Pathways with impact value > 0.1 and −log10(p) > 1.3 are considered to be impacted.
