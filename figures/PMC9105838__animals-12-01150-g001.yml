caption: Flow diagram of the model for the spread of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
  in a typical Slovenian dairy herd. Possible health states represented by boxes are
  susceptible young (Sy); latent young (Ly); latent cows (Lh), infected cows (Ih)
  and high shedding cows (H) on the high shedding pathway; susceptible cows (Sa);
  latent cows (Ll) and infected cows (Il) on the low shedding pathway; and culled,
  dead or sold animals (C). The bought compartment (B) represents animals outside
  the herd that can be introduced. The arrows represent how individual animals change
  from one state to another. All parameters and calculations are defined in  and .
