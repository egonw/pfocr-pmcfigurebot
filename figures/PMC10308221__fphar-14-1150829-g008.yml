caption: Possible action mechanisms of tetrandrine to inhibit the proliferation of
  mesangial cells induced by deglycosylated human IgA1. Deglycosylated human IgA1
  molecule stimulated the expression of IgA1 receptor, CD71 and β4GALT1. Consequently,
  MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated, resulting in triggering cell cycle to
  regulate mesangial cell proliferation. Tetrandrine decreased the expression of IgA1
  receptor, CD71 and β4GALT1, and thus, inhibited the activation of MAPK/NF-κB, resulting
  in triggering cell cycle arrest to stop at S phase companied with the upregulating
  of cyclin A2 and downregulating of cyclin D. Taken together, tetrandrine possibly
  inhibited the proliferation of mesangial cells induced by enzymatically deglycosylated
  human IgA1 via IgA receptor/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
