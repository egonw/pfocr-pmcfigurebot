caption: BMSCs induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  A–F Western blot showed that BMSCs increased the total protein level of PI3K, and
  enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in SAP, whereas the total protein level of AKT was
  not significant changed. Besides, Nrf2 was notably increased in the nucleus in SAP + BMSCs
  group. G, H Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm Nrf2 nuclear translocation
  induced by BMSCs. Data are shown as mean ± SD for at least 3 separate experiments.
