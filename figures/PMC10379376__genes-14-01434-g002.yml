caption: Main targets of miR-302/367 cluster. The miR-302-367 cluster plays a central
  role in maintaining ESC pluripotency and self-renewal by regulating different signaling
  pathways. The cytoplasmic mature miR-302/367 gene products positively regulate self-renewal
  by modulating G1/S transition through direct targeting of the cell cycle regulators,
  such as CYCLIN D1/D2 and CDK4/6. Additionally, they promote S phase entry via an
  alternative Rb-independent pathway. These mature miRNA products also maintain the
  pluripotency of ESCs by targeting Nodal/Activin inhibitors, such as LEFTY. They
  also promote BMP signaling through direct targeting of BMP inhibitors (TOB2, DAZAP2,
  and SLAIN1), thus maintain pluripotency by repressing neural differentiation. Moreover,
  miR-302/367 members promote reprogramming and iPS cell establishment through induction
  of global DNA demethylation by post-transcriptional suppression of epigenetic regulators
  such as AOF1/2, MECP1/2, and MBD2.
