caption: Possible role of elevated plasma eHSP70 and a lower HSR in a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  In several cells, infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 might lead to downregulation of
  ACE2. This would decrease the production of angiotensin (1–7) and the activation
  of the MAS receptor. MAS receptor activation induces anti-inflammatory responses
  and, in addition, by the activation of SIRT1, stimulates the HSR pathway []. Without
  this axis, the HSR is diminished and the inhibitory effect of intracellular HSP72
  over NF-κB is absent, leading to a disrupted inflammatory resolution. The cytokine
  storm induces direct damage on cells/tissues and activates, along with the increased
  sympathetic tonus, the release of HSP72 to the extracellular environment (eHSP72)
  []. Extracellular HSP72 might reinforce the inflammatory system and induce activation
  of TLR (Toll-like receptors, particularly TLR4) in several cell types, including
  pancreatic beta cells and skeletal muscle []. The chronic activation of the TLRs
  by eHSP72 might reduce the capacity of the HSR activation, worsening the inflammatory
  response and altering metabolic status.
