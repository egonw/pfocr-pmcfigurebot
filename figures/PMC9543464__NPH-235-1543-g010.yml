caption: 'A schematic representation of the chloroplast MEP pathway involved in Bamboo
  mosaic virus (BaMV) accumulation. The product IPP of the MEP pathway was converted
  to GGPP by GGPPS2 and then via the gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis pathway to synthesize
  GA. GA could upregulate GA‐response genes that might include BaMV accumulation‐assistance
  factors, such as CA and FNR. The arrows are the metabolic steps in the MEP pathway
  and their downstream products, including the GA biosynthesis. The arrows in red
  are the steps involved in BaMV accumulation. The blunt‐ended arrow represents the
  enzyme inhibitor. FSM, fosmidomycin. Enzymes: DXS, 1‐deoxy‐d‐xylulose‐5‐phosphate
  synthase; DXR, 1‐deoxy‐d‐xylulose 5‐phosphate reductoisomerase; CMS, 4‐diphosphocytidyl‐2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol
  synthase; CMK, 4‐diphosphocytidyl‐2‐C‐methylerythritol kinase; MCS, 2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol
  2,4‐cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, 4‐hydroxy‐3‐methylbut‐2‐en‐1‐yl diphosphate
  synthase; HDR, 1‐hydroxy‐2‐methyl‐butenyl 4‐diphosphate reductase; GGPPS2, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase 2; GGPPS11, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase 11; CPS,
  ent‐copalys diphosphate synthase; KS, ent‐kaurene synthase; KO, ent‐kaurene oxidase;
  KAO, ent‐kaurenoic acid oxidase; CA, carbonic anhydrase; FNR, ferredoxin‐NADP+ oxidoreductase.
  Metabolites: G3P, d‐glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate; DXP, 1‐deoxy‐d‐xylulose 5‐phosphate;
  MEP, 2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol 4‐phosphate; CDP‐ME, 4‐diphosphocytidyl‐2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol;
  CDP‐MEP, 2‐phospho‐4‐diphosphocytidyl‐2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol; ME‐cPP, 2‐C‐methyl‐d‐erythritol
  2,4‐cyclodiphosphate; HMBPP, 1‐hydroxy‐2‐methyl‐2‐(E)‐butenyl 4‐diphosphate. IPP,
  isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate; ent‐CDP, ent‐copalys diphosphate.'
