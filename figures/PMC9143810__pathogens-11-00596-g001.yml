caption: The effect of CoCl2 on RAW 264.7 cells and B. abortus viability and B. abortus
  internalization into macrophage cells. RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with different
  concentrations of CoCl2 for 72 h, and the cell viability was evaluated using the
  MTT assay (A). Cells were pretreated with 10 µg/mL of CoCl2 for 6 h, and the number
  of invaded Brucella was determined at 15, 30, and 45 min pi (B). The involvement
  of F-actin, ERK1/2, and HIF-1α proteins in the phagocytosis signaling pathway at
  30 min pi was determined using an immunoblotting assay (C). Protein intensity from
  the Western blot bands was analyzed by ImageJ software and normalized relative to
  β-actin (D). The direct bactericidal effect of CoCl2 on Brucella survival was evaluated
  for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h (E). The data are represented as the mean ± SD of duplicate
  samples from at least two independent experiments. Statistically significant differences
  relative to the control group are indicated by an asterisk (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001).
