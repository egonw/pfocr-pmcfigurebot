caption: CO mitigates hypoxia-inducible tubular cell damage. To examine the cytoprotective
  effect of CO on the tubular cell damage, cell viability, ATP levels, oxidative stress
  and EMT pathway under hypoxia condition, HK-2 cells were treated with CORM-2 under
  hypoxia condition for 48 or 96 h, then analyzed by (A) qRT-PCR (n = 3/group), (B)
  CCK-8 assay (n = 5/group), (C) ATP assay (n = 4/group), (D, F) immunoblot (n = 3/group),
  and (E) CM-H2DCF-DA assay. To examine the effect of CO on the interaction between
  tubular cells and fibroblast cells under hypoxia condition, NRK-49F cells were treated
  with the supernatant from HK-2 cells, which was cultured with or without CORM-2
  under hypoxia condition for 96 h, then analyzed by (G) immunoblot (n = 3/group).
  Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M.
