caption: Rtt109 and Fun30 in RTT109Hz/FUN30Hz regulate the transcription of DNA damage
  response pathways genes differentially in response to different types of genotoxic
  stressors. Expression of (A). FUN30; (B). RTT109; (C). SNF2; (D). TEL1; (E). MEC1;
  (F). RAD9; (G). MRC1; (H). RAD5 was analyzed in FUN30myc and RTT109Hz/FUN30mycHz
  strains in the presence of H2O2 (7.5 mM), CPT (100 µM), and MMS (0.02%). The qPCR
  data are presented as average ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates. * p < 0.05.
