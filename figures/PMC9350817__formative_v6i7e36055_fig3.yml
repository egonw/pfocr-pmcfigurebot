caption: 'Knowledge graph that links concepts defined in domain ontologies (eg, GISO:
  CensusTract) to data resources stored in databases (eg, percentage Black population)
  or those derived from the analytics layer. The upper part of the figure shows the
  nodes and edges produced through semantic inference during the knowledge engineering
  phase. The lower part of the figure shows the nodes and edges added through ML analysis
  during the feature engineering phase. GISO: geographical information system ontology;
  HIO: health indicators ontology; ACESO: adverse childhood experiences ontology;
  COPE: Childhood Obesity Prevention (Knowledge) Enterprise; DO: disease ontology.'
