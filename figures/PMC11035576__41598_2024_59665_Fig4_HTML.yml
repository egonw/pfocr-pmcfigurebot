caption: Dexrazoxane induces ESCC cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase.
  (A) The representative images of cell apoptosis after dexrazoxane treatment at 72 h
  in KYSE450, KYSE30, and KYSE70 cells were shown. (B) Cell apoptosis at 72 h was
  analyzed based on annexinV + gating. (C) Apoptotic protein markers were measured
  after dexrazoxane treatment at 72 h in KYSE450 and KYSE30 cells. (D) The effect
  of dexrazoxane treatment on the cell cycle at 48 h was statistically analyzed. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Error bars represent the mean ± SD of at least three independent
  experiments. Cropped images and uncropped blots are displayed in Supplementary Fig.
