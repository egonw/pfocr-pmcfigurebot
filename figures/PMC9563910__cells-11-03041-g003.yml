caption: 'Pentose phosphate pathway regulation depends on cellular needs. MODE 1:
  This mode dominates when the need for R5P is higher than that for NADPH, for instance,
  in proliferative cells. In this situation, the glycolytic metabolites 3GP and F6P
  can be converted in R5P through the reversible non-oxidative PPP. The oxidative
  PPP and its associated NADPH formation are bypassed. MODE 2: This mode occurs when
  the needs for NADPH and R5P are balanced. Then, ideally, from one molecule of G6P
  two molecules of NADPH and a molecule of R5P can be obtained with no generation
  of glycolytic metabolite. MODE 3: This mode is adopted when the cellular need for
  NADPH exceeds that for R5P and ATP, for instance, during fatty acid synthesis in
  adipocytes. The non-oxidative phase of the pathway leads to the conversion of ribulose
  5-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
  Then, these glycolytic metabolites—through gluconeogenesis reactions—form G6P, which
  can enter again into the PPP to produce more NADPH. MODE 4: In this scenario, the
  cellular need for NADPH and ATP is higher than that for R5P. As described in PPP
  mode 3, ribulose 5-P is transformed into G3P and F5P through the non-oxidative branch
  of the PPP; however, in mode 4, these molecules are metabolized to pyruvate through
  glycolysis, which is associated with ATP formation.'
