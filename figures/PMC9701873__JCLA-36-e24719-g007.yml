caption: MMP1 is closely correlated with EMT markers, neurotrophic factors, and Schwann
  cell markers in tumor tissues from PC patients. The correlations of the expression
  of MMP1 with the expression of EMT markers (E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin, and Vimentin)
  (A), Schwann cell markers (S100A4, P75NTR, and GFAP) (B), and neurotrophic factors
  (BDNF, GDNF, NRTN, and NGF) (C) were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.
