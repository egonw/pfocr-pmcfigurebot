caption: 'Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase expression largely overlap
  in somatic and dendritic compartments in the Locus coeruleus. (a) Shows immunostaining
  against key enzymes in the synthesis pathway of NE. White dotted lines show an overlay
  mask of the corresponding section from The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates
  3rd Edition Franklin and Paxinos. (a) Confocal image of immunofluorescence against
  tyrosine hydroxylase (TH/green) from a brain stem slice of a young P14 mouse (anterior-posterior
  axis: −5.40 mm). The fluorescence signal is present in the soma as well as in the
  dendritic arbor (here more dominantly in the medial part); we observed a similar
  spatial distribution for the fluorescence signal from immunostainings against the
  dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (magenta). (b) Depicted are the same immunostainings as
  in (a) on brain slices obtained from an old P500 mouse. A similar spatial expression
  profile for both enzymes is visible when compared to slices from a young P14 mouse
  (a). (c) Shows a quantification of average pixel (px) intensities from the yellow-colored
  ROIs displayed in TH/DbH overlay image in (a,b). ROIs are placed above the somatic
  or dendritic compartments, respectively. (c) Shown is the average intensity of pixel
  values from ROIs along the dorsal–ventral axis for soma or dendrites. Scale bar
  100μm.'
