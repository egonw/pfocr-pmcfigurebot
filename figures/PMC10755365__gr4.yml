caption: CD109 rescues the effects of altered FLOT2 expression on NPC cells in vitro(A)
  The cell viability of NPC cells was evaluated by the CCK-8 method.(B and C) The
  cell cycle of NPC cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.(D and E) The cell invasion
  ability of NPC cells was tested by the matrigel invasion analysis. Scale bar, 100 μm.(F
  and G) The cell migration ability of NPC cells was evaluated with the scratch wound
  healing analysis. Scale bar, 100 μm. ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Data are represented
  as mean ± SD.
article_title: FLOT2 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression through suppression
  of TGF-β pathway via facilitating CD109 expression.
