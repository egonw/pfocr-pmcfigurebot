figure_title: Combination therapy with cetuximab, paclitaxel, and cisplatin led to
  a partial response in a patient with Keap1 mutant advanced-stage metastatic HNSCC
caption: 'A Clinical characteristic of head and neck cancer patient cohort treated
  with chemotherapy and analyzed for Keap1 and Nrf2 mutation by Sanger sequencing.
  B, C Association Keap1 mutations and local treatment failure in patients with HNSCC
  treated with chemotherapy. B Patient cohort and, C Stage IIIâ€“IV patients who were
  treated with chemotherapy. D, E Tumor progression in an index patient with lung
  metastasis was associated with the identification of Keap1 and Shh mutations and
  tumors from index patients with Keap1 mutant strongly expressed Notch1 and Hes1.
  In both cases, patients with Keap1 mutations achieved a partial response to 31%
  and 37% reduction, respectively, in the metastatic lung region upon treatment with
  two lines of chemoradiation/cetuximab (patient case #1) and three cycles of TPE
  (docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by chemoradiation with cisplatin
  treatment (patient case #2). F Clinical courses/outcomes of Keap1 mutant HNSCC patient
  treated with chemoradiation therapy. SD stable disease, PD progressive disease.'
