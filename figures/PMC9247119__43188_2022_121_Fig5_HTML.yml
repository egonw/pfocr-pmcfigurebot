caption: 'LTCC is involved in CDCQ-induced eNOS activity and NO production via phosphorylation
  of PKA, CaMKKβ, CaMKII, and AMPK. a The effect of CDCQ on intracellular Ca2+ influx
  in endothelial cells is mediated by LTCC. Cells were pretreated with 50 μM nifedipine
  (NIF) and Fluo-4-AM was applied. Next, the cells were stimulated with 20 µM CDCQ
  for 5 min. b Effects of LTCC and calmodulin inhibition on eNOS phosphorylation by
  CDCQ. Cells were pretreated with 10 μM NIF, 10 μM BAPTA-AM (BAPTA), or 10 μM W7
  for 30 min, and then with 20 μM CDCQ for 1 h. c Cells were pretreated with 50 μM
  NIF, 10 μM BAPTA, and 10 μM W7 for 30 min, and then with 20 μM CDCQ for 15 min.
  Western blotting was performed to assess phosphorylation of PKA, CaMKKβ, CaMKII,
  AMPK, and eNOS. d Cells were pretreated with 50 μM NIF, 10 μM H89, 10 μM CC, or
  10 μM KN62 for 30 min prior to incubation with DAF-2DA for 30 min and treatment
  with 20 μM CDCQ for 90 min. NO production was assayed using the NO-specific fluorescent
  dye DAF-2 DA. *Significantly different from the control at p < 0.01. #Significantly
  different from CDCQ-treated cells at p < 0.01'
