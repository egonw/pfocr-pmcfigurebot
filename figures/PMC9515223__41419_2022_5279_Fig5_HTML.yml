figure_title: MXD1 overexpression reduces the malignant behaviors of ECCA cells
caption: A, B RT-qPCR and Western blot validated MXD1 overexpression in ECCA cells.
  B Western blot analysis of the expression of mitosis-related genes in ECCA cells.
  MXD1 overexpression failed to modulate not only the EMT-related gene expression,
  but also the expression of AIFM1 and BCL-2 in ECCA cells. C–E MXD1 overexpression
  attenuated the cell cycle C, proliferation D, E of ECCA cells. F MXD1 overexpression
  decreased the tumor volumes in mice. G Immunohistochemistry analysis of MXD1 and
  Ki67 expression in the xenograft tumors from nude mice. Data are representative
  images of each group from three separate experiments. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001.
  Orange bar, 50 μm. Green bar, 20 μm.
article_title: HOXA5 inhibits the proliferation of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  cells by enhancing MXD1 expression and activating the p53 pathway.
