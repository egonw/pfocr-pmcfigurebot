figure_title: Schematic highlighting potential contributions from the studies suggested
  here towards augmenting retrosynthetic enzyme synthesis. The concepts behind each
  are outlined in the text along with how they can contribute to improving the data
  that will give rise to retrosynthetic enzymatic capabilities. E1 and E2 represent
  enzymes in an assembled pathway while the subscripts a–c or a–e represent homologs
  with different substrate and reactivity profiles
