caption: 'LPA induced EMT marker expression via the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways.
  (A–C) HK-2 cells were pretreated with the vehicle (DMSO), 10 µM PD 98059 (PD; an
  ERK inhibitor) (A), 10 µM SP600125 (SP; a JNK inhibitor) (B), or 2.5 µM LY 294002
  (LY; a PI3K/AKT inhibitor) (C) for 1 h and subsequently treated with 20 µM LPA for
  30 min (for p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-AKT) or 48 h (for E-cadherin and vimentin). Protein
  levels of E-cadherin, vimentin, p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-AKT were analyzed via Western
  blotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and normalized to those of β-actin,
  total ERK, total JNK, and total AKT, respectively. Representative images (left)
  and graph analysis bar graphs (right) are shown (n = 3 independent experiments).
  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005 vs. Con; # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.005 vs. LPA. (D) The animal experiments are described
  in the Materials and Methods section. Immunohistochemical detection of p-ERK, p-JNK,
  and p-AKT was performed in the kidney tissues using specific antibodies and DAB.
  The nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. The positive expression area of
  each target gene was quantified using ImageJ software. Representative images (left)
  and quantitative analysis bar graph (right) are shown. Original magnification, 200×;
  scale bars, 20 μm; n = 3 mice per group. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. **
