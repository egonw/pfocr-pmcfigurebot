caption: DCZ0415 reduces metastasis of CRC cells. (A) Luciferase‐transduced RKO cells
  were injected into the tail veins of NSG mice, which were treated with DCZ0415 (alternate
  days injection of 10 mg·kg−1 i.p.) or vehicle. (B) Representative photograph showing
  the liver and kidney from mice. (C) H&E images of the lung, liver, kidney and bone
  in vehicle‐ or DCZ0415‐treated tumours. Arrows indicate metastatic lesions; Lu—lung;
  Li—liver; Ki—kidney; B—bone; BM—bone marrow. 2×; scale bar, 500 µm.
article_title: DCZ0415, a small‐molecule inhibitor targeting TRIP13, inhibits EMT
  and metastasis via inactivation of the FGFR4/STAT3 axis and the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway
  in colorectal cancer.
