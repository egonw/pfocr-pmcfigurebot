caption: Schematic representation of the p62/Keap1/Nrf2 non-canonical pathway activated
  by rMS in THP-1-derived macrophages infected with S. aureus. THP-1-derived macrophages
  infected with S. aureus mediate an activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, which regulates
  the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α,
  and promote S. aureus intracellular survival. In THP-1-derived macrophages, treatment
  with rMS results in an increase in phosphorylated p62 at Ser349, which results in
  increased interaction with Keap1 and the release of Nrf2. The phosphorylated p62-Keap1
  complex is identified for degradation via autophagy. Nrf2 is then free to translocate
  to the nucleus, interact with small Maf proteins, and bind antioxidant response
  element (ARE), leading to the upregulation of genes coding for antioxidant, detoxifying,
  and anti-inflammatory proteins, as well as coding for p62. Nrf2 silencing was obtained
  by utilizing specific siRNA in THP-1-derived macrophages or utilizing alveolar macrophages
  isolated from Nrf2 knockout mice.
