caption: Clustering result of a single-cell transcriptome of SCLCs. (a) Uniform manifold
  approximation and projection (UMAP) plots, showing (left) the clustering result
  and (right) cell cycle phases computed using Seurat. (b) Pathway enrichment analysis
  for the clustering result in (a), based on the DEGs with adjusted P-values, in which
  top five enriched terms are shown. (c) SSMs and scaled log-transformed read count
  table, which are vertically concatenated and clustered based on the SSM for disease.
  Only top significant signs and DEGs are shown in rows. (d) Diffusion map plots of
  the SSM for disease, showing (top) the clustering result and (bottom) cell cycle
  phases. (e) Violin plots showing sign scores of significant signs, in which separation
  indices (I) for the clusters marked with asterisks against the others show ** and
