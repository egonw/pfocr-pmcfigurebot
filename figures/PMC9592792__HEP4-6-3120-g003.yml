caption: UK Biobank laboratory associations for non‐synonymous variants in credible
  genes. Each row corresponds to a gene and non‐synonymous variant (or a pair of variants
  in the case of high linkage disequilibrium (r 2 > 0.5); one haplotype includes amino
  acid substitutions in both ABCG5 and ABCG8. The additional columns provide an inverse‐normal‐transformed
  effect size (expressed as upward red [increased percentage of a SD] and downward
  blue [decreased percentage of a SD] arrows) for individual traits. All of the effect
  sizes are oriented toward the low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)–increasing allele (see
  Table  for additional details). ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine transaminase;
  AST, aspartate aminotransferase; DBili, direct bilirubin; GGT, gamma‐glutamyltransferase;
  DBili, Direct bilirubin HDL, high‐density lipoprotein; LDL low‐density lipoprotein;
  TG, triglyceride.
