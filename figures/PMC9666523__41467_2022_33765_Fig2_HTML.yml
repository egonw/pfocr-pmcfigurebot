caption: a A diagram of Golgin family members at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). b
  qRT-PCR analysis of tonic (left) or ligand-activated (right) lfnb1 mRNA expression
  after mock knockdown (siCtrl) or specific siRNA knockdown of Gcc1, Gcc2, Golga1,
  or Golga4 in wild-type MEFs. n = 3. c A heatmap showing expression of indicated
  ISGs (right) at the resting-state in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO MEFs after control, Sting,
  Mavs siRNA knockdown. d Western blot analysis of STING signaling kinetics. Gcc2WT
  and Gcc2KO MEFs were stimulated with HTDNA (1 µg/mL) for indicated times (top).
  Quantification of relative Sting protein abundance (normalized to Tubulin, then
  set 0 h value to 1) are shown on the right. p-Sting, p-Tbk1, and p-Irf3 are key
  phosphorylation events of the STING signaling pathway. e ELISA analysis of mIFN-β
  in the supernatant in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO MEFs 24 h after HSV-GFP infection (m.o.i. = 1).
  n = 4. f HSV-1-GFP infection in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO MEFs. Top, representative FACS
  plot of GFP expression 24 h after HSV-1-GFP infection (m.o.i. = 1). Lower panels,
  percentage of GFP+ cells (lower left), GFP MFI (Mean fluorescence intensity, lower
  middle) and HSV-1 titers in the supernatant (lower right) in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO MEFs.
  g–i Confocal microscopy analysis of endogenous STING trafficking and signaling.
  Gcc2WT or Gcc2KO MEFs were stimulated with HT-DNA (1 µg/mL) for indicated times
  (top). Cells were then stained for endogenous STING (green) and Golgi marker GM130
  (red) (g, top). Quantification of fluorescence intensity of endogenous STING in
  the Golgi (GM130+ area) using Fiji (g, bottom). A similar set of cells were stained
  for p-Tbk1 and p-Irf3 (images in Supplementary Fig. , ). Quantification of fluorescence
  intensity of endogenous p-TBK1 (h) and p-IRF3 (i) in Gcc2WT and Gcc2KO MEFs are
  shown. The colored area corresponds to Golgi-dwell time. n = 3. Data are representative
  of at least three independent experiments. At least 14 cells in two different views
  were analyzed (g–i). Data (b, e and g–i) are shown as mean ± s.e.m. P values were
  determined by one-way ANOVA (b and e) or by two-way ANOVA (g–i).
