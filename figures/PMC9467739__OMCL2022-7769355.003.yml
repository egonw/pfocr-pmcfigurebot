caption: 'QCT inhibited MPP+-induced ferroptosis in PC12 cells by activating the Nrf2
  pathway. (a) Viabilities of PC12 cells treated with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mM MPP+
  for 24 h or 48 h (n = 5). (b) Viability of PC12 cells treated with or without Fer-1
  (1 μM, 1 h), followed by MPP+ (0.5 mM, 24 h) treatment (n = 5). (c) Viability of
  PC12 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by MPP+ (0.5 mM, 24 h)
  treatment (n = 5). (d) Representative immunoblots for SLC7A11 and GPX4 proteins
  from PC12 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by MPP+ treatment
  (0.5 mM, 24 h). (e, f) Quantification of SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein levels (n = 3).
  (g) Representative immunoblots for nuclear and total Nrf2 proteins from PC12 cells
  treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by MPP+ (0.5 mM, 24 h) treatment.
  (h, i) Quantification of nuclear and total Nrf2 protein levels (n = 3). (j) Immunofluorescent
  analysis from PC12 cells treated with or without QCT (10 μM, 1 h), followed by MPP+
  (0.5 mM, 24 h) treatment. Scale bar = 50 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. One-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey''s post hoc test. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ns: no significant difference.'
