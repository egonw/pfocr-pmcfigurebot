caption: Combined treatment of berbamine and ArcA potently downregulates CaMKIIγ-mediated
  growth signaling pathway. (A–D) U87MG- and C6-derived GSCs were treated with the
  indicated concentrations of berbamine and ArcA for 24 h. (A,B) Effect of combined
  treatment of berbamine and ArcA on the cell cycle in both GSCs. Cell cycle distribution
  was detected using a Muse Cell Analyzer with Muse® Cell Cycle kit. (C) Effect of
  combined treatment of berbamine and ArcA on the CaMKIIγ-mediated STAT3/AKT/ERK1/2
  signaling pathway in U87MG-derived GSCs. (D) Effect of combined treatment of berbamine
  and ArcA on the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in U87MG-derived GSCs.
  (C,D) Protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies
  and were further quantified by densitometry. β-Actin levels were used as an internal
  control. * p < 0.05 vs. the compound alone or the control.
