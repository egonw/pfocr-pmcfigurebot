caption: Bioinformatics analysis predicts the mechanism by which GE protects against
  RPE mitochondrial damage under hyperglycemia. (A) A cluster diagram was used to
  evaluate the expression changes of intracellular molecules after adding GE under
  hyperglycemia; (B) a volcano plot was used to display differentially expressed genes;
  (C) PPI network was used to select core targets in differentially expressed genes;
  (D) a Venn diagram was used to identify the shared genes of differentially expressed
  genes and AKT pathway-related genes. UMAP, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection;
  GE, genipin; FC, fold change; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; RPE, retinal
  pigment epithelial; PPI, protein-protein interaction.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
