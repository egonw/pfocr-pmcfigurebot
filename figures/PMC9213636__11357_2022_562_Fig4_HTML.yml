caption: NanoString analysis of ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 16
  weeks following TBI. A Principal component analysis (PCA) plot of the transcription
  levels of neuroinflammatory genes in the cortex. PCA was performed using all normalized
  gene counts from the NanoString neuroinflammation panel. The four sample groups
  were young sham (blue sphere), young TBI (red tetrahedron), old sham (green cube),
  and old TBI (black octahedron). The three main principal components of variation
  were captured on the x-, y-, and z-axis, respectively, showing a clear separation
  of clusters between the four groups. B PCA plot of ipsilateral hippocampus tissue
  samples. C–D Pathway analysis of transcriptome levels in the cortex and hippocampus
  based on gene annotations given by NanoString reveal high percentage of genes related
  to oligodendrocyte function being modified by age in the cortex, while the hippocampus
  showed insulin signaling as the most highly modified pathway. Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes in the E–G cortex and H–J hippocampus, demonstrating specific genes
  with log2 (fold change) larger than 1 and statistical significance of log10(P) higher
  than 1. N = 6 mice/group
article_title: Functional and transcriptional profiling of microglial activation during
  the chronic phase of TBI identifies an age-related driver of poor outcome in old
  mice.
