figure_title: Negative regulation of SIRT1 by Ikaros is AMPK dependent
caption: (A) BMMs from mSirt1-KO and FLOX mice were transfected with siControl or
  siIkaros RNAs. Lysates were probed by western blots for Ikaros, SIRT1, p-AMPKα,
  AMPKα and VCL as a loading control. (B) Relative intensity ratios with VCL normalization
  (n = 3). (C) wild-type BMMs transfected with siControl or siIkaros RNAs were pre-treated
  with Compound C (10 μM, 2 h). Lysates were probed by western blots for Ikaros, p-AMPKα,
  AMPKα, SIRT1 and VCL expression. (D) Relative intensity ratios with VCL normalization
  (n = 2). (E) Wild-type BMMs were transfected with siAMPKα/siControl RNAs for 48
  h, followed by another 24 h transfection with siIkaros/siControl RNAs. Lysates were
  probed by western blots. (F) Relative intensity ratios with VCL normalization (n
  = 2). (G) Schematic illustration how myeloid-specific Ikaros–SIRT1 axis orchestrates
  macrophage inflammation. Ikaros negatively regulates SIRT1 via AMPK, which inhibits
  caspase-1/GSDMD processing. In the acute liver IRI-phase, Ikaros signaling favors
  sterile inflammation in conjunction with negative regulation of SIRT1 via AMPK,
  resulting in activation of the canonical inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway to release
  IL1β and IL18. (A-F) Data shown are mean ± SEM. *p <0.05; **p <0.01, ***p <0.001
  by Student’s t test. BMM, bone marrow-derived macrophages; IRI, ischemia-reperfusion
  injury; KO, knockout; si(RNA), small-interfering RNA.
