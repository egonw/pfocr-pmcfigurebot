caption: 'Exogenous Wnt3a and Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synergistically promote
  the activation of the β-catenin pathway and phenotypic transformation of atrial
  fibroblasts; (A-D) Western blot detection of changes and their statistical analysis
  results in the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Collagen I, and β-catenin
  in the atrial fibroblasts after the Wnt3a intervention and the Wnt3a + TMAO intervention,
  respectively; (E) immunofluorescence image of β-catenin; the arrow represents the
  nuclear localization of β-catenin, the blue is the nucleus, and the green is β-catenin;
  (F) immunofluorescence image and statistical analysis of α-SMA; the blue is the
  nucleus, the green is α-SMA; (G) immunofluorescence image and statistical analysis
  of Collagen I; the blue is the nucleus, the red is Collagen I. n=3. Scale =20 µm.
  The values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation; *P<0.05, compared to
  the control group; #P<0.05, compared to the Wnt3a group.'
article_title: The transformation of atrial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is promoted
  by trimethylamine N-oxide via the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway.
