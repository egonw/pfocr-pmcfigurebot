caption: Cellular responses to single agent and combination drug therapies. A. mRNA
  expression profile of S462TY cells treated for 24hrs with digoxin, rigosertib, selumetinib,
  digoxin selumitinib and rigosertib + selumetinib. B. Combination drug treatment
  results in unique emergent cellular responses not seen in single agent therapies.
  Pathway enrichment as determined by SuperPath analysis on RNAseq data obtained from
  S462-TY cells subjected to drug treatment for 24hrs (single and combo).
