figure_title: The p38α-BLIMP1 axis controls iPC differentiation and ER-related transcriptome
caption: 'a Cultured p38α KO and WT B cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding
  p38α or BLIMP1 at day 2 of in vitro differentiation. Flow cytometry analysis of
  iPCs in retrovirally transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) 6 days after transduction
  (n = 6 per group). b ELISpot analysis of IgG1 and IgE antibody-secreting cells among
  cultured B cells as (a) (n = 3 per group). c Heatmap analysis of differential expression
  genes (foldchange > 2) in iPCs of indicated genotypes. Group 1: decreased in p38α
  KO iPCs, restored by p38α or BLIMP1 overexpression. Group 2: decreased in p38α KO
  iPCs, restored by p38α but not BLIMP1 overexpression. Group 3: decreased in p38α
  KO iPCs, restored by BLIMP1 but not p38α overexpression. Group 4: decreased in p38α
  KO iPCs, restored by neither p38α nor BLIMP1 overexpression. Group 5: increased
  in p38α KO iPCs, restored by p38α or BLIMP1 overexpression. Group 6: increased in
  p38α KO iPCs, restored by p38α but not BLIMP1 overexpression. Group 7: increased
  in p38α KO iPCs, restored by BLIMP1 but not p38α overexpression. Group 8: increased
  in p38α KO iPCs, restored neither p38α nor BLIMP1 overexpression. d Gene Ontology
  enrichment analysis of Group 1 from (c). e Immunoblot analysis of BLIMP1, p38α,
  IgG H-chain, Actin and UPR-related proteins, Bip, IRE1α, SEC61A1 and SEC61B in retrovirally
  transduced B cells at day 8 in iPC culture. f Cultured p38α KO and WT B cells were
  transduced with retroviruses encoding p38α or BLIMP1 at day 2 of in vitro differentiation.
  Representative transmission electron microscopy images of sorted iPCs in retrovirally
  transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+CD138+) of indicated groups at day 8. Scale bars, 500 nm.
  Percentage of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion and diameter of ER lumen in iPCs
  of indicated groups (n ≥ 100 per group). Data were representative of at least three
  independent experiments (a, b, e, f). Each symbol represents a representative sample.
  Small horizontal lines indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by one-side
  hypergeometric test (d) and two-tailed unpaired t-tests (a, f). Source data are
  provided as a Source Data file.'
