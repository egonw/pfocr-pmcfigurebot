figure_title: METTL3 modification of EphA2/VEGFA promotes VM in CRC cells via PI3K/AKT
  and ERK1/2 signaling in vitro and in vivo
caption: A METTL3 deletion HCT116 cells and control cells were injected into flanks
  of nude mice and the representative mice were presented. B Tumor growth curve after
  the injection of METTL3-deficient HCT116 cells and control cells into nude mice
  (n = 7). C Tumors weight was measured. D, E The expression of EphA2/VEGFA in tumors
  was detected by qRT-PCR and AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway was detected through western
  blotting. F Representive images of IHC staining for METTL3, EphA2, VEGFA and CD31
  protein on a tumor tissue. p values were calculated using t test from three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05.
