figure_title: MC38 cells from responding tumors have increased cell death and damage
caption: A DEGs between responder and nonresponder tumor cells plotted on a differential
  clustering heatmap. Teal box = nonresponders and untreated, pink box = responders.
  B Quantification of DEGs comparing untreated vs. responders to untreated vs, nonresponders.
  C DEGs from responding and nonresponding tumors compared to published gene sets
  for apoptosis/DNA damage. Red = upregulated genes; green = downregulated genes;
  both are compared to untreated. N = 5 untreated, 10 irradiated (4 responders, 6
  nonresponders). D Immunohistochemistry performed on d14 untreated or irradiated
  tumors against anti- cleaved caspase 3, HMGB1 (E), calreticulin (F). N = 10 untreated,
  7 nonresponders, 4 responders. G Pathway analysis of DEGs from responding (R) sorted
  tumor cells compared to nonresponding (NR). D, E, F - Statistical significance by
  ANOVA.
