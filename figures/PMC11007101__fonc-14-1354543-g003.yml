caption: the structure of EV and the process of destroying cancer cells. EV binds
  to Nectin-4 on the cell membrane, and the EV-antigen complex is internalized and
  transported along the endosomal pathway. In this process, various enzymes can incompletely
  hydrolyze EV, and finally EV is completely decomposed by lysosomes. The released
  MMAE will destabilize the microtubules, and the cells will undergo apoptosis due
  to the inhibition of division.
