caption: 'AURKB overexpression partially reverses the effects of NCAPH knockdown on
  DDP resistance and the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Cell apoptotic rate in each
  group was assessed using the TUNEL assay. Magnification, Ã—200. (B) Protein expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins were detected using western blotting. (C) Protein
  expression levels of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins were detected
  via western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. MCF-7 or sh-NC; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. MCF-7/DDP or sh-NCAPH-2 + oe-NC; +P<0.05, ++P<0.01 and +++P<0.001 vs. MCF-7/DDP
  + sh-NCAPH-2 + oe-NC. AURKB, aurora kinase B; NCAPH, non-structural maintenance
  of chromosome condensin I complex subunit H; sh, short hairpin RNA; DDP, cisplatin;
  oe, overexpression; NC, negative control; p, phosphorylated; t, total.'
