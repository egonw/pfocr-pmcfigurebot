figure_title: CD34+ CML cells showed increased OXPHOS and decreased glycolysis
caption: A Hierarchical clustering analysis for nine HALLMARK metabolic pathways between
  CD34+ CML and normal samples. Clustering was done using Euclidean distance and complete
  linkage method with the differentially expressed genes (FC > 2 and P < 0.01) that
  annotated in the metabolic pathways. Quantile normalization was applied prior to
  the analysis. B Correlation between metabolic proteomic/transcriptomic in primitive
  CML CD34+ cells using Pearson method. Filled black circles indicate all metabolic
  proteins/genes in KEGG (n = 1,480); filled red, green, and blue circles indicate
  proteins/genes in central carbonate metabolic pathway (n = 101). rm all metabolic
  proteins/genes correlation, rc central metabolic proteins/genes correlation. C Bubble
  plot representation of selected KEGG pathways that are enriched in the metabolic
  categories for CD34+ CML samples. The size of each bubble corresponds to the number
  of genes within the given gene set. The pathways enriched in upregulated genes are
  colored in red, and pathways enriched in downregulated genes are colored in blue.
  D Western blot analysis of proteins in TCA and glycolysis. E Comparative metabolomics
  analyses of primary CD34+ purified from CML or normal donors performed via LC-MS.
  Data are shown as the mean from n = 3 experiments. F Oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
  levels were examined in normal or CML CD34+ using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer (n = 3).
  G, H ATP levels and basal respiration were examined. I Extracellular acidification
  rates (ECAR) of CD34+ purified from CML or normal donors were measured by Seahorse
  Glycolysis Stress Kit. J, K Level of glycolysis and glycolytic capacity were examined.
