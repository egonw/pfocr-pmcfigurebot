caption: BF treatment differentially regulated DNA damage and repair-related pathways.
  (a) (i) qRT-PCR analysis shows DNA damage and repair-related gene (P53, BCl2, MDM2,
  ATM, ATR, CHEK1, CHEK2) expression after BF treatment. Depicted values are mean
  of three independent (n = 3) experiments. Error bars depict ± 95% confidence interval.
  Asterisk depicts significance, which is determined by p value ≤ 0.05. Significance
  was calculated by using Student’s unpaired two-sample t-test based on the difference
  between each sample mean compared to the corresponding control mean. Values were
  normalized to RPLP0 (housekeeping gene) and subsequently to DMSO-treated control
  organoids. (ii, iii) WB analysis shows increased P53 protein expression at 24 h
  in the healthy line and at 72 h in the patient line, thus implying DNA damage and/or
  apoptotic cell death. Bar graphs show protein expression in fold change. Depicted
  values are mean of three independent (n = 3) experiments. Error bars depict mean
  ± standard deviation (SD). Values were normalized to β-Actin (housekeeping protein)
  and subsequently to DMSO-treated control organoids. (b) Dot plots from KEGG pathways
  revealed DNA damage and repair-related pathways such as P53 signaling pathway, homologous
  recombination, Fanconi Anemia pathways to be upregulated in the healthy line at
  24 h (iii) and downregulated in the patient line (ii). Additionally, at 24 h, the
  patient line showed activation of NFκB, PI3K, and chemokine signaling pathways,
  thus implying the onset of inflammation (i). Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction,
  neuroactive ligand–reactor interaction, cAMP signaling pathway were downregulated
  in the healthy line at 24 h (iv).
