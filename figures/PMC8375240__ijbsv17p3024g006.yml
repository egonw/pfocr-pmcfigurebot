caption: UBE3A activates NOTCH pathway via ZNF185 in esophagus cancer cells. A and
  B, Eca-109 cells were transfected with indicated constructs for 48h. Cells were
  subjected to RNA-seq analysis and subsequent Reactome (A) and KEGG pathway enrichment
  (B). C and D, Notch signaling pathway was activated after knockdown of ZNF185 (C).
  The heatmap indicated genes involved in Notch signaling pathway changed after knockdown
  of ZNF185 (D). E and F, Eca-109 and TE-1 cells were infected with indicated shRNAs.
  72 h post infection, cells were harvested for Western blotting analysis (E) and
  RT-qPCR analysis (F). G, Eca-109 cells were infected with indicated shRNAs. 72 h
  post infection, cells were harvested for Western blotting analysis. H, Eca-109 cells
  were infected with indicated shRNAs. After 48 h, cells were transfected with indicated
  plasmids. 24 h post transfection, cells were harvested for Western blotting analysis.
  I, Eca-109 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids for 24 h. Cells were harvested
  for Western blotting analysis. J, The hypothesis model depicts that ZNF185 inhibits
  the NOTCH pathway in esophageal cancer, then the up-regulated UBE3A promotes ZNF185
  degradation to activate the NOTCH signaling pathway in esophageal cancer cells.
