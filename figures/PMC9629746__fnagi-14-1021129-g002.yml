caption: 'Effects of ROS on the CypA/MMP9 pathway, BBB permeability, and synaptic
  plasticity proteins in anesthesia/surgery mice. Scavenging of ROS improves the tight
  junction (TJ) proteins, attenuates the BBB leakage, and CypA/MMP9 activation, as
  well as increases synaptic plasticity proteins in anesthesia/surgery mice. The level
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the prefrontal cortex was assessed by DHE staining
  (A,B). Scale bars: 100 μm. The protein levels of CypA, MMP9 (J–L), ZO-1, occludin,
  claudin5 (C–F), PSD95, and synaptophysin (M–O) were assessed by western blotting.
  S100β levels in serum were measured by ELISA (G). IgG leakage staining (red fluorescence)
  was shown in the cortex (H,I). Scale bars: 100 μm. Values are expressed as mean
  ± SEM and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc
  test. n = 3–5 per group. A/S, anesthesia/surgery. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001, compared to control group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, compared
  to A/S group.'
