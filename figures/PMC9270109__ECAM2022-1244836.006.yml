caption: Blocking PI3K compromised increase of miR-126 KD on apoptosis in lung cancer
  cells. (a) Two si-PI3KR2 vectors significantly decreased mRNA expression of PI3KR2
  in A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (b) KD of PI3KR2 compromised increase
  of miR-126 KD on increase of caspase 3 mRNA expression in A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01,
  n = 4); (c) KD of PI3KR2 compromised increase of miR-126 KD on increase of caspase
  9 mRNA expression in A549 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (d) KD of PI3KR2
  compromised increase of miR-126 KD on decrease of cell viability in A549 cells (∗∗P
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (e) two si-PI3KR2 vectors and si-scramble vectors
  were transfected in H1650 cells, which indicated that two si-PI3KR2 vectors significantly
  decreased mRNA expression of PI3KR2 in H1650 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4);
  (f) KD of PI3KR2 compromised increase of miR-126 KD on increase of caspase 3 mRNA
  expression in H1650 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4); (g) KD of PI3KR2 compromised
  increase of miR-126 KD on increase of caspase 9 mRNA expression in H1650 cells (∗∗P
  < 0.01, n = 4); (h) KD of PI3KR2 compromised increase of miR-126 KD on decrease
  of cell viability in H1650 cells (∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, n = 4).
