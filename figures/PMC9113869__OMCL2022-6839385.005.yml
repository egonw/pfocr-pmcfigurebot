caption: 'The activation of IL-10/stat3 signaling was linked to the protective effect
  of AKG against I/R damage. (a) Western blot analysis and quantification of IL-10
  and stat3 expression in the indicated groups (n = 4). (b) IL-10 levels were measured
  using an ELISA kit (n = 5). (c) Immunofluorescence staining (n = 5) (IL-10, red;
  DAPI, blue). (d) Western blot analysis and quantification of IL-10 and stat3 expression
  in the indicated groups (n = 4). (e) IL-10 levels were measured using an ELISA kit
  (n = 5). (f) The levels of superoxide anions as determined by DHE staining are shown
  in representative photos and quantitative analysis (n = 5). (g) The levels of proinflammatory
  cytokines were measured using ELISA (n = 5). (a–c) ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P
  < 0.01 versus the sham group and #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.01 versus the
  MCAO group; (d–g) ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group, #P < 0.05 and
  ##P < 0.01 versus the OGD/R group, and $P < 0.05 and $$P < 0.01 versus the OGD/R+AKG50
  group.'
