figure_title: SEMA3 induces YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and inactivation
caption: (A) Sema3A activates the Hippo pathway. U87-MG cells were treated with human
  recombinant SEMA3A protein (rSEMA3A) or conditioned medium of cells expressing SEMA3A
  (cm-S3A). Phosphorylation of YAP and LATS was determined by phos-tag and phospho-specific
  antibodies, respectively. Slow migration on phos-tag gels indicates that proteins
  were hyperphosphorylated. 0.5× and 1.0× indicate that the conditioned medium was
  diluted twofold or undiluted, respectively. HM, hydrophobic motif; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase. (B) Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) shows
  that SEMA3A inhibits expression of YAP/TAZ target genes (CYR61, CTGF, and ANKRD1)
  in U87-MG and HEK293A cells. (C) SEMA3A regulates Hippo signature genes. A volcano
  plot of the RNA-seq results showing that rSEMA3A protein decreased expression of
  YAP/TAZ signature genes in U87-MG cells. In total, 1890 genes were down-regulated,
  and 1394 genes were up-regulated. (D) Plexins are required for Hippo regulation
  by SEMA3A. Wild-type (WT) and PLXNA1/2/3 tKO HEK293A cells were treated with SEMA3A.
  Phosphorylation of YAP and LATS was determined as in (A). (E) SEMA3A induces YAP/TAZ
  cytoplasmic localization in a PLXNA-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence was performed
  to stain cells with YAP/TAZ antibody (red), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
  (blue), and phalloidin (green for actin). Scale bars, 25 μm. (F) Deletion of NRP1/2
  in HEK293A cells compromised SEMA3A-induced phosphorylation of YAP and LATS.
