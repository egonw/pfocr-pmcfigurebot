caption: '(A) PVT1 expression level was significantly up-reguated in ESCC tumor tissues
  (n = 77), ∗P < 0.05. (B) The expression of PVT1 in ESCC tumor tissues, microarray
  data, and TCGA database. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of PVT1 expression in ESCC cell lines
  EC9706, EC109, and TE-1, and normal esophageal mucosa cell line HEEC. (D) ROC curve
  of the expression level of PVT1 in ESCC tissues for RT-qPCR (n = 77). (E) ROC curve
  of the expression level of PVT1 of ESCC tissues from TCGA database RNA sequencing
  (n = 279). (F) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the PVT1 expression and TCGA ESCC
  patients’ overall survival time correlation. (G) Effect of lentivirus-PVT1-siRNA
  on EC109 cell lines, Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay; (H) Effects of
  lentivirus-PVT1-siRNA on the cell cycle of EC109 cells, ∗P < 0.05. (I) Effects of
  lentivirus-PVT1-siRNA on apoptosis of EC109 cells. (J) Typical western blotting
  bands. (K) Relatively optical density analyzed of proteins expression by Image pro
  plus software. ESCC: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; HEEC: Human esophageal
  epithelial cell; MTT: Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; PVT1: Plasmacytoma variant
  translocation 1 gene; ROC: Receiver operating characteristic; RT-qPCR: Real-time
  quantitative PCR; siRNA: Small interfering RNA; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas.'
