caption: SPA70 and combination regimen induces necroptosis and exacerbates cell death.
  All the experiments were treated with 2 nM PTX, 10 μM SPA70, or combined regimen
  for 48 h. (A) Merge pictures showing Hoechst 33342 (specifically stains apoptotic
  cells) and PI (specifically stains necroptotic cells) staining in all indicated
  groups. The photographs were taken by fluorescence microscopy (200×). (B) Western
  blot analysis of classic RIP1-RIP3-MLKL pathway in all treatment groups (n = 3).
  “+” indicates combination treatment of PTX and SPA70. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01,
  compared with indicated groups. Ns means no statistical significance.
