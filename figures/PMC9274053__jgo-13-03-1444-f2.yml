caption: UBE2C promotes metastatic activity in PC cells. (A) UBE2C knockdown (KD,
  shUBE2C) was successfully performed in the indicated cells. The impact of UBE2C
  knockdown on proliferation (B) was assessed. PC cell migration (C) and invasion
  (D) by 0.1% crystal violet staining after 24 hours (magnified ×200) were analyzed.
  Data in (B-D) were compared via Student’s t-tests. *, P<0.05; ***, P<0.001. UBE2C,
  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C; PC, pancreatic cancer.
article_title: UBE2C promotes the progression of pancreatic cancer and glycolytic
  activity via EGFR stabilization-mediated PI3K-Akt pathway activation.
