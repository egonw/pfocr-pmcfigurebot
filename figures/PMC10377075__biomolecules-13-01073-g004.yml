caption: Observation of the effects of PAM treatment on PC-9 cell migration using
  high throughput microarray. (A) The migration of PC-9 cells on the chip was recorded
  at regular intervals, and the migration locations of cells on the chip at 0 h, 16
  h, 20 h, and 24 h were recorded. The Ⅰ, Ⅱ, and Ⅲ channels were used as the control
  group, and the Ⅳ, Ⅴ, and Ⅵ channels were used as the LTP (30 s) treatment group.
  The auxiliary red line in the figure represents the straight-line distance of PC-9
  cell migration. (B) Quantification of the migration distance of PC-9 cells incubated
  at different times after 30 s PAM treatment. Data represent the mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 with ANOVA compared with the control.
