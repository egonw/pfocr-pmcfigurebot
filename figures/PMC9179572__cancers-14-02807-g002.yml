caption: SCAMP3 modulates the EGFR signaling pathway. Immunoblots and densitometry
  quantification of (A,B) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with SCAMP3 targeting siRNA
  and non-targeting sequence (siNC). (C,D) MDA-MB-468 WT and SC3 knockout cells. (E,F)
  MCF-10A control cells and SC3 overexpressing cells (SC3OE). Lysates were probed
  using the indicated antibodies. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
  test; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. The experiments were carried out at least three times.
