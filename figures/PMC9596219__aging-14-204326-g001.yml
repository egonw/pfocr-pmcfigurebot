caption: Elevated DAZAP1 is associated with poor outcome of MM patients. (A) DAZAP1
  expression in different stages of MM from the GSE5900 dataset as shown in the graph.
  The signal level of DAZAP1 (226620_at signaling) was shown on the y-axis. The groups
  of normal plasma (NP, n = 22), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
  (MGUS, n = 44), and multiple myeloma (MM, n = 351) were sorted on the x-axis, respectively.
  (Bâ€“F) Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) divided by high and low DAZAP1
  expression in TT2, TT3, APEX, HOVON65 and GSE136337 cohorts. The number of patients
  in the cohorts was 351, 208, 264, 426 and 288, respectively. (G) DAZAP1 expression
  was increased in relapsed patient samples relative to the first diagnosis samples.
  (H) A box-plot showed DAZAP1 expression in eight MM subgroups.
