caption: MHO7 induced ER stress and cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells. (A) The top KEGG
  pathway enrichment was analyzed by RNA-seq. The red highlighted upregulated pathways,
  and the blue highlighted downregulated pathways. (B) The heat map of DEGs related
  to ER stress. (C) ER stress-regulated genes in MDA-MB-231 cells were detected by
  qRT-PCR under MHO7 treatment. (D) The expression of BiP/p-PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP
  were measured by western blot under MHO7 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. (E) Bcl-2
  was detected by qRT-PCR when si-CHOP or MHO7 (3 µM) treatment. (F) Bax was detected
  by qRT-PCR when si-CHOP or MHO7 (3 µM) treatment. (G) Representative apoptosis rate
  was measured by flow cytometry under si-CHOP or MHO7 (3 µM) treatment. *P <0.05;
  **P < 0.01; ***P <0.001; and ****P < 0.0001; ns=no significant.
