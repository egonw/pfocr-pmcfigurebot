caption: 'Effect of Ulva pertusa on NF-κB pathway and interleukin’s production. IκB-α
  basal levels were identified in sham mice, differently an increase in the degradation
  of IκB-α was found in the DNBS-vehicle group (A), densitometric analysis (A1). Against,
  NF-κB expression was significantly increased in the DNBS group compared to the sham
  group (B), densitometric analysis (B1). However, Ulva pertusa 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg
  restored IκB-α expression (A), densitometric analysis A1 and decreased NF-κB one
  (B), densitometric analysis B1. These results were also confirmed by the evaluation
  of phosphorylated proteins (C), densitometric analysis (C1) and (D), densitometric
  analysis (D1). In serum, a substantial increase in the levels of interleukins -5,
  -9, and -13 was detected in the animals of the DNBS group compared to the Sham group
  (E–G). Treatment with Ulva pertusa reduced this expression in a dose-dependent manner
  (E–G). In contrast, IL-4 was decreased in DNBS mice compared to the control group
  (H); treatment with Ulva pertusa led to dose-dependent overexpression of IL-4 (H).
  Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Values are means
  ± SD. One-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni. ** p < 0.01 vs. Sham; *** p < 0.001
  vs. Sham; # p < 0.05 vs. DNBS; ## p < 0.01 vs. DNBS; ### p < 0.001 vs. DNBS.'
