caption: AVolcano plot depicting the DEGs between the LPS and naïve groups. Dots represent
  non‐DEGs (grey) and DEGs (FC > 0, red; FC < 0, blue); genes of interest were in
  dark colors.B, CBubble plots showing the top40 enriched suppressed/activated GO
  terms (B) as well as KEGG pathways (C) between the LPS and naïve groups.DGSEA plot
  of the enriched KEGG pathways related to inflammation between the LPS and naïve
  groups.ECategory net plot of top5 enriched KEGG pathways when comparing the TPT
  group with the LPS group. The color gradient indicates the fold changes between
  the TPT and LPS groups computed by EdgeR (log2 transformed); the size of the category
  (pathways enriched) indicates the number of genes contributing to the enrichment.F–HHeatmaps
  plotting the changes in expression levels of the genes contributing to the enrichment
  analysis of MAPK signaling pathway (F), Toll‐like receptor signaling pathway (G),
  and IL‐17 signaling pathway (H) across samples when comparing the TPT group with
  the LPS group.IBar plot of the 8 genes in (Fig ) according to BART result; Irwin‐Hall
  P‐value indicates the integrative rank significance; color gradients were coded
  by BART‐computed relative rank.JBar plot of the de novo motifs enriched at the promoters
  of DEGs between the TPT and LPS groups; transcription factors with known motifs
  that matched the de novo motifs the best were listed accordingly.
