caption: Effects of CoCl2-induced conditions on HIF-1α expression and MCF-7 cell viability.
  (A) MCF-7 cells were treated with 0–800 μM of CoCl2 for 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and
  72 h and subjected to MTT assay. (B,C) HIF-1α protein expression of MCF-7 cells
  was analyzed by Western blotting after treatments with 50, 100, 150, and 200 μM
  of CoCl2 for 6 h or 150 μM of CoCl2 for 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h. The relative quantities
  of HIF-1α protein were quantified and normalized with β-actin. (D) MCF-7 cells were
  pretreated with 150 μM CoCl2 for 6 h and then treated with plumbagin for another
  24 h. The MCF-7 cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Data are means ± SEM compared
  with the control from three independent experiments (n = 3). * p < 0.05 vs. control.
