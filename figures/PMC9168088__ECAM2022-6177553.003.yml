caption: 'Rh4 induces ferroptosis in HT29 and HCT116 cells. (a), (b) ROS concentrations
  were analyzed by flow cytometry after HT29 and HCT116 cells were exposed to different
  concentrations of Rh4 in medium with or without 1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours;
  the cells were stained with DCFH-DA. (c) The relative concentration of GSH in HT29
  and HCT116 cells exposed to different concentrations of Rh4 in medium with or without
  1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours. (d) Concentrations of iron in HT29 and HCT116
  cells exposed to different concentrations of Rh4 in medium with or without 1 μM
  Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours. (e) The relative concentrations of lipid ROS in
  HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to different concentrations of Rh4 in medium with
  or without 1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours. (f) Concentrations of MDA in HT29
  and HCT116 cells exposed to different concentrations of Rh4 in medium with or without
  1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours. (g) Representative Western blot images of
  ferroptosis-related protein expression in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to different
  concentrations of Rh4 in medium with or without 1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours.
  (h), (i) Relative expression levels of proteins involved in the ferroptosis pathway
  in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to different concentrations of Rh4 in medium with
  or without 1 μM Fer-1 pretreatment for 48 hours. ns∗p > 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001: statistically significant compared with the control group (0 μM Rh4);
  ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001: statistically significant compared with the 200 μM Rh4
  group.'
