caption: Sunitinib leads to autophagy. (A) Autophagic vacuoles were detected by MDC
  staining after Sunitinib exposure at 0, 5, 10, 15 μM for 48 h, and autophagosomes
  were observed on fluorescence microscopy (scale bars = 100 μm). White arrows denote
  autophagosomes. (B) Quantification of MDC intensities (n = 3). (C) Autophagosomes
  were detected by TEM after Sunitinib exposure at 0, 10 μM for 48 h (scale bars =
  2 μm). Yellow squares denote autophagosomes. N, nuclear. (D) P62 and LC3B levels
  in L02 cells incubated with Sunitinib (15 μM) for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h were measured
  (n = 3). (E) P62 and LC3B protein expression in L02 cells incubated with Sunitinib
  (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 μM) for 48 h were measured (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and
  ***p < 0.001 vs. Control group.
