caption: PG induced cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt (a)
  Cell cycle analysis of A172, LN229 and U251 cells by flow cytometry. All cells were
  exposed to 0 or 200 nM PG for 48 h. (b) Statistical data of cell cycle assay. All
  experiments were repeated three times. (c)The mRNA level of P21 was analyzed by
  RT-PCR. Data were expressed as the means ± SD. (d) The protein levels of P21, P53,
  p-Akt (S473), Akt and β-actin in LN229 cells treated with PG. Human β-actin was
  used as a reference gene. Experiments were performed three times. (e) Graphic representation
  of relative levels of protein expression in LN229 cells treated with PG. Data are
  expressed as the means ± SD. p < 0.05. (f) Western blotting analysis of the target
  proteins in LN229 cells expressing p-Akt or vector in the presence or absence of
  PG (100 nM) for 48 h. Experiments were performed three times. (g) Graphic representation
  of relative levels of protein expression in LN229 cells treated with PG with or
  without pBabe-Akt. Data are expressed as the means ± SD. p < 0.05.
