figure_title: ROBO3s loss impairs the Hippo pathway and CSC characteristics
caption: 'A Pathway enrichment analysis (EnrichR web tool) showing that genes significantly
  downregulated upon ROBO3 knockdown are enriched for the KEGG 2019 signature “Signaling
  pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells” and “Hippo signaling pathway”. B
  Tumorsphere formation assay of control and siROBO3 treated HCC1806 cells (left panel).
  Quantification of tumorspheres number normalized to the control condition (right
  panel). C qRT-PCR showing a decrease of stem cell specific ALDH genes expression
  in siROBO3 treated HCC1806 cells. D Measurement of CD24 and CD44 positive population
  by fluorescence activated flow cytometry in HCC1806 cells treated with siCont or
  siROBO3. E Western blot of HCC1806 cells showing protein levels of SOX2, YAP1 and
  TEAD1 upon ROBO3 knockdown. F Tumorsphere formation assay of siControl, siYAP1 or
  siTEAD1 treated HCC1806 cells (left panel). Quantification of tumorspheres number
  normalized to the control condition (right panel). G Tumorsphere formation assay
  of siCont and siROBO3 treated HCC1806 cells, without or with LATSi (10 μΜ, left
  panel). Quantification of tumorspheres number normalized to the control conditions
  (right panel). B, D, E, F and G: Error bars represent mean ± SEM of three biological
  replicates, unpaired t-test or chi2-test G. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
