caption: EG production profile and corresponding culture growth curves of transformants
  1 and 2, with or without the presence of inducer(s) in a fructose-rich medium, are
  shown in (a, b), respectively. C24 represents theC. autoethanogenum C24 control
  strain carrying the regulatory elements for induction at PtcdB. Addition of the
  inducer(s) is represented by the red dotted line. Lact. = lactose; theo. = theophylline.
  Error bars represent standard deviation (n = 3).
