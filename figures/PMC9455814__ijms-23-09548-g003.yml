caption: Simplified lunasin mechanism of action against cancer. Lunasin (LUN) has
  antioxidant capacity, lowering intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.
  Furthermore, lunasin has epigenetic effects, binding to the N-terminus of deacetylated
  histones H3 and H4, as well as regulating acetylation (Ac) and deacetylation of
  specific lysines. Lunasin also binds to and antagonizes integrin-mediated signaling
  pathways, such as Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Lunasin antagonism on integrins decreases
  FAK, Src, ERK, and Akt phosphorylation. Integrin antagonism also allows lunasin
  to inhibit the NF-κB pathway by limiting IκB kinase (IKK) activation. The IKK complex
  phosphorylates and promotes IκB degradation, releasing p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB
  for nuclear translocation and the activation of gene expression. Thus, the epigenetic
  and integrin-antagonistic actions of lunasin regulate the expression of genes involved
  in its anticancer properties, including anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, cell
  cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and antiproliferation.
