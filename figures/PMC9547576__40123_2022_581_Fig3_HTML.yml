caption: Signalling and regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Black arrows indicate
  the signalling process. (1) Interferon (IFN), cytokines (CK), or growth hormone
  (GH) bind to receptors to form receptor–ligand complexes that activate receptors
  and further phosphorylate Janus kinase (JAK). (2) STAT proteins are activated and
  form homodimers or heterodimers. (3) STAT homodimers transfer to the nucleus. (4)
  STAT proteins act as part of a transcription factor complex, controlling the transcription
  of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming
  growth factor-β (TGFβ), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and so on. (5)
  Exerting biological effects. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-1/2/3 and
  cytokine-inducible SH2 proteins (CIS) can negatively regulate the JAK-STAT pathway
  by inhibiting activation of GH–receptor–JAK complex. Protein inhibitor of activated
  STAT (PIAS) negatively regulates the activation of the STAT proteins. The SH domain
  in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) can bind to signalling molecules, activated
  receptors, and JAK to dephosphorylate the substrates. CREB-binding protein (CBP)
  and P300 are essential coactivators of one of the STAT proteins
