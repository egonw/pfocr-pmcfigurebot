  subjects and controls
caption: (A) Heatmap of z-score Personalized PageRank (PPR) for top 10 significantly
  differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) (FDR <0.05) ranked by absolute
  change in PPR for NeuN-positive (NeuN+) (upper panel) and NeuN-negative (NeuN-)
  (lower panel) schizophrenia vs control nuclei samples. (B) Overrepresented pathway
  analysis (FDR <0.05) for 203 downstream regulatees common to the top four schizophrenia
  vs control NeuN+-specific transcription factors (TFs) (ZNF333, SOX2, ZEB1, and RBPJ).
  (C) Overrepresented pathway analysis (FDR <0.05) for 225 downstream regulatees common
  to the top four schizophrenia vs control NeuN--specific TFs (FOS, BCL6, IRF1, and
  KLF15).
