caption: Diagram transverse through 4-week embryo (inset focuses on splanchnic mesoderm)
  demonstrates serous membrane ( gray arrows ) outlining the coelomic cavity ( light
  green arrows ) and primitive mesentery. Splanchnic mesoderm (brown arrows) has unfolded
  from the midline and formed the primitive mesentery, suspending and containing the
  primitive gut ( purple arrows ). The primitive gut ( purple arrows ) divides the
  primitive mesentery into dorsal ( green arrow ) and ventral ( orange arrow ) mesenteries.
  The subserous space ( yellow ) is a continuous space made up of the splanchnic mesoderm
  ( brown arrows ) and somatic mesoderm ( light purple arrows ).
