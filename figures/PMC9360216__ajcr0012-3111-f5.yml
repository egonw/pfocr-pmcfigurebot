caption: MEG3 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin by GSK-3β. A. Western
  blotting assays suggested that β-catenin protein expression is increased in retinoblastoma
  cells stably transfected with shRNA-GSK-3β. B. Western blotting assays suggested
  that MEG3 had no significant regulatory effect on β-catenin expression in retinoblastoma
  cells with low GSK-3β protein expression. C. Rescue assays of GSK-3β overexpression
  in (shGSK-3β + MEG3) cells. D. Ubiquitination assays suggested that in retinoblastoma
  cells with low expression of GSK-3β, MEG3 had no significant effect on the ubiquitination
  of β-catenin. E. Transwell assays showed no obvious regulatory effects of MEG3 on
  the invasion of retinoblastoma cells in retinoblastoma cells with low GSK-3β expression.
  F. Schematic diagram of the regulatory pathway of MEG3 on β-catenin. *P<0.05.
