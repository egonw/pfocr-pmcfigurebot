figure_title: Metabolic pathway regulation in MDR-TB
caption: (A) Unbiased pathway analysis using plasma HRM with C18 negative chromatography
  to compare the metabolome of persons with multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB (n = 85)
  to (A) asymptomatic controls without TB disease (n = 57) and (B) persons with drug
  susceptible (DS)-TB (n = 89) shows TCA cycle metabolism and multiple overlapping
  pathways in fatty acid synthesis, activation and metabolism were the most significantly
  regulated pathways in MDR-TB. The y-axis shows significantly regulated metabolic
  pathways and the x-axis shows the -log p-value for pathway enrichment adjusted for
  age, sex and HIV status. (C) Correlation analysis of primary metabolite adducts
  (M-H) mapping to significant pathways reveals a network of highly correlated metabolites
  involved in the TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism and methionine and cysteine metabolism
  that were significantly increased in persons with MDR-TB.
