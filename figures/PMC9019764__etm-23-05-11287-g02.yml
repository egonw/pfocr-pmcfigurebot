caption: SIN suppresses angiogenesis by inhibiting the activity of VEGF in HepG2/C3A
  cells. (A) SIN down regulated the expression levels of VEGF and HIF-1α under hypoxic
  conditions as determined by western blot analysis. n=3, *P<0.05. (B) SIN inhibits
  VEGF secretion of HepG2/C3A cells under hypoxic conditions as determined by ELISA.
  n=5, *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. (C) The expression levels of VEGF were analyzed by RT-qPCR
  in HepG2/C3A cells. n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01. (D) HepG2/C3A cells were pre-incubated
  with SIN for 48 h in a hypoxic environment and subsequently CM was collected to
  assess tube formation. SIN-treated CM inhibits the tube-formation ability of HUVEC
  (magnification, x40). n=8, ***P<0.001. SIN, sinensetin; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; CM, tumor-conditioned medium.
