caption: Circ_0006174 targets miR-1205 to modulate CCBE1 expression. (A) Bioinformatics
  was used to predict the binding site of CCBE1 3′UTR to miR-1205. (B) Dual-luciferase
  reporter gene experiment was used to confirm the binding sites between miR-1205
  and CCBE1 3′UTR. (C) GEPIA database analyzed the relationship between CCBE1 expression
  and the survival rate of CRC patients. (D) RT-qPCR was utilized to examine CCBE1
  mRNA5 expression in 68 cases of CRC tissues. (E) RT-qPCR was performed to determine
  CCBE1 mRNA expression in normal human colonic epithelial cell line and CRC cell
  lines (HCT116, SW620, SW480 and HT29). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used
  to analyze the association between (F) miR-1205 expression and CCBE1 expression
  and (G) CCBE1 expression and circ_0006174 expression in CRC tissue. (H) RT-qPCR
  and western blotting experiments were employed to determine CCBE1 mRNA and protein
  expression in CRC cells following transfection with miR-1205 inhibitor. (I) RT-qPCR
  and western blotting were performed to determine CCBE1 mRNA and protein expression
  after the cells were co-transfected with circ_0006174 siRNA and miR-1205 inhibitor.
