caption: Treatment effects on myogenesis, atrogenes mRNA expression and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway with inhibitors in the C2C12 myoblast cell line. (A) Heatmap of MRF and
  atrogenes showed that (B) both the VIB and Mg groups could significantly increase
  the relative expression level of Myf5 mRNA compared with the Con group. The VIB
  and Mg + VIB groups showed a similar significantly increasing effect on Myf6 mRNA
  expression compared with the Con group. (C) Inhibitor groups had significantly decreased
  Myf5 and MyoG expression. (D,E) Western blots of protein expressions of mTOR, PI3K-p85,
  Akt, pAkt and GAPDH in different treatment groups in vitro. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  and *** p < 0.001, n = 3â€“5.
