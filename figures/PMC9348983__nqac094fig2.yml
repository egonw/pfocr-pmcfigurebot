caption: 'Coefficients of metabolites with self-reported red and processed meat and
  poultry intake: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk
  study (n = 11,432). Metabolites were classifed by metabolic pathway (). The colors
  represent the coefficients (weights) of each metabolite in each metabolite score;
  red means positive association and blue means negative association. *The metabolite
  was annotated based on in silico predictions, which indicates the compound has not
  been confirmed based on a standard but its identity is confident. GPA, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  GPC, glycerophosphocholine; GPE, glycerophosphoethanolamine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol;
  HODE, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid.'
