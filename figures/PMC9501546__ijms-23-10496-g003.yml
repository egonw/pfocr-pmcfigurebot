caption: Genes co-expressed with TTYH3 and related pathways in bladder cancer. (A)
  UALCAN analysis of the profile of genes co-expressed with TTYH3. (B–F) Profiles
  of genes co-expressed with TTYH3 involved in signaling pathways in bladder urothelial
  carcinoma (BLCA). This figure depicts the results showing the gene ontology (GO)
  and signaling pathways of TTYH3, and the positively correlated genes in bladder
  cancer. The bar graphs represent genes positively correlated to TTYH3, showing the
  involvement in BLCA in pathway analysis performed using Enricher. The bar graph
  represents the ratio of the percent composition of terms in proteomic data vs. percent
  composition in the genome annotation. The length of the bar represents the significance
  of that specific gene-set or term. (G) Western blot analysis of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and FGFR1 proteins in TTYH3-knockdown bladder cancer
  cell lines. α-tubulin expression was used as the control.
