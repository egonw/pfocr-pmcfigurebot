caption: '(a) Scheme of HSA-ICG nanoparticles for enhanced tumor accumulation in 4T1
  tumors by passive (EPR effect) and active (gp60 transcytosis pathway) targeting;
  (b) fluorescence imaging of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice after the injection of free ICG
  (upper) and HSA-ICG nanoparticles (lower) at different time intervals; (c) photoacoustic
  imaging of the mice; (d) tumor growth curves after different treatments (* p < 0.05,
  a: partial irradiation, b: accurate irradiation, c: over irradiation); (e) thermal
  images of mice exposed to 808 nm laser for 5 min. Figures are reproduced from ref.
