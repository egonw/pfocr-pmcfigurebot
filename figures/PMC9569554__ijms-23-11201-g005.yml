caption: Wnt Signaling Pathway. (A) Bone angiogenesis. HIF-1 up-regulates Wnt7a/7b
  in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates VEGF transcription
  and promotes vessel growth. (B) Endochondral bone formation. HIF-1 activates Wnt
  to increase the expression levels of c-Myc to promote the osteoblast proliferation.
  Sclerostin inhibits Wnt signaling. HIF-1 increases expression of the BMP antagonists
  and decreases Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation to decrease sclerostin transcript in osteoblasts
  and osteocytes. β-catenin promotes the differentiation of MSCs into mature osteoblasts
  and inhibits the differentiation into adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. HIF-1
  is also found to inhibit Wnt signaling. (C) Skeletal repair. The interaction between
  the Wnt pathway and TNFα mediates inflammatory process and regulates the balance
  between skeletal bone formation and resorption. (D) Skeletal repair. Wnt pathways
  regulate the progranulin that promotes the differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes
  as well as endochondral ossification. BMP2 increases the expression of LRP5 and
  stabilizes β-catenin promoting osteogenic differentiation.
