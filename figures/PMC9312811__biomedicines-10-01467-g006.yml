caption: Chrysin induces autophagy proteins in A375SM and A375P human melanoma cancer
  cells. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of chrysin and protein
  levels of LC3 and Beclin 1 were measured by Western blotting. β-actin was used as
  a loading control. Quantification was performed in three independent experiments
  using ImageJ, normalizing the intensities of the bands to the controls. Data are
  presented as the mean and standard deviation for three samples. Significance was
  determined by Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, compared with the control.
