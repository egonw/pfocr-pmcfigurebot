caption: 'Loss of WAVE2 inhibits ITGB1 expression and activity. A, Pathway analysis
  of the RNA-seq generated from CTRL and W2-KO MDA-MB-231 cells. Each dot represents
  a signaling pathway. The red dots represent the pathways that are significantly
  (P < 0.05) differentially regulated between the CTRL and the W2-KO groups. The black
  blots represent nonsignificantly differentially regulated pathways. The ECM receptor
  interaction pathway is shown with a yellow dot (P = 2.197e−5). B, Volcano plot from
  the RNA-seq analysis of the differentially expressed genes between CTRL and W2-KO
  MDA-MB-231 cells. The X-axis represents the log2 fold change in expression levels
  and the Y-axis shows the P values. Red dots: upregulated genes; Blue dots: downregulated
  genes; Black dots: no significant change. The dots of the genes of interest are
  labeled. C, Bars and values representation of the log2 fold change in expression
  levels of WAVE2, ITGB1, and ITGA6 derived from the RNA-seq data. D, Correlation
  of expression levels between WAVE2 and ITGB1 in human breast cancer specimens from
  the cBioPortal breast cancer datasets (P < 0.01). E, Representative WB analysis
  of protein lysates from CTRL and W2-KO MDA-MB-231and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines
  probed with the indicated antibodies. β-Actin was used for loading control. The
  numbers under the WB bands represent the fold change of the signal with respect
  to the CTRL band after normalization to the β-Actin signal. F, Confocal microscopy
  images of IF staining of CTRL, W2-KO, and ITGB1-KO MDA-MB-231 cells that were stained
  for WAVE2 (red) or ITGB1 (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Scale bar:
  50 μm. Representative histograms of flow cytometry analyses for cell surface expression
  of ITGB1 (G) and activity: HUTS4 binding (H) of CTRL, W2-KO and ITGB1-KO MDA-MB-231
  cells. A shift to the right indicates increased expression or activity. Data shown
  are representative of three replicates.'
