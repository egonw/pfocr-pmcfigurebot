caption: COPS3 mediated the MEK/ERK pathway in COAD cells. Immunoblot assays showed
  the expression of phosphorylated MEK and ERK and expression of these proteins in
  SW480 and HCT116 cells upon the transfection of control or COPS3 siRNAs or without
  transfection (control). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001,
  siCOPS3 vs. siControl.
