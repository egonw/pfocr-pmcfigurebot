figure_title: In vivo and in vitro juvenile liver fluke show divergent expression
  of proteases and metabolic enzymes
caption: (A) Cathepsin expression profile across newly excysted juvenile (NEJ), 21
  day old juvenile (JUV) and adult Fasciola hepatica life stages compared to expression
  in in vitro and in vivo maintained F. hepatica juveniles. Differential expression
  of cathepsin B (CATB) and cathepsin L (CATL) encoding transcripts in in vivo and
  in vitro maintained F. hepatica juveniles (log2FC) and across F. hepatica life stage
  transcriptomes generated by Cwiklinski et al. [] (NEJ, JUV, ADULT; Z score of fragments
  per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, FPKM). Abbreviated gene IDs
  in brackets refer to gene IDs in . Note that only the expression of genes annotated
  in both Cwiklinski et al. [] and our datasets were analysed, novel genes could not
  be analysed due to their absence from the original genome annotation. (B) Protease/peptidase
  profiles of in vitro and in vivo maintained F. hepatica juveniles. Proportion diagram
  showing expression of proteases in in vitro and in vivo maintained juveniles. Individual
  gene counts (n =) are shown beside each protease group. (C) Downregulation of key
  enzymes of aerobic and anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism in in vivo maintained F.
  hepatica juveniles. Expression (log2FC) of key enzymes associated with metabolism
  in in vivo maintained F. hepatica juveniles. Fh-PK = pyruvate kinase and Fh-SD =
  succinate dehydrogenase are key enzymes of aerobic metabolism via Krebâ€™s cycle;
  Fh-ME-malic enzyme is a key enzyme of aerobic acetate production; Fh-PEPCK = phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxykinase,
  key enzyme of malate dismutation pathway.

  growth and development of Fasciola hepatica juveniles.
