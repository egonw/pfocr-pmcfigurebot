figure_title: (a) NH3 synthesis rate for Co–N–C, Co/C, and N–C under 1 MPa. (b) NH3
  synthesis pathway on single Co sites in the form of steady-state Co1–N3.5 (A represents
  the active sites); (c) NH3 production on dynamic cyclic sites via the chemical-looping
  pathway (x is in the range of 0 < x ≤ 1.5 and VN* represents an anionic nitrogen
  vacancy). (d) Schematic diagram of the preparation process of Co–Nx with different
  CNs. (e) Co K-edge EXAFS spectra of Co–Nx catalysts. (f) NH3 synthesis rate over
  the as-synthesized Co–Nx catalysts at 1 MPa and 300 °C. (g) Scheme for the preparation
  of the graphene lattice-confined Fe-single-site catalyst FeN4©G-K. (h) Production
  rates of FeN4©G-K, FeN4©G, FePc-K, and FePc-BM/G-K as a function of reaction temperature
  at 0.1 MPa. (i) The effluents monitored by in NH3 synthesis over FeN4©G-K at 180
  °C, 0.1 MPa, and WHSV of 30 L gc−1 h−1
