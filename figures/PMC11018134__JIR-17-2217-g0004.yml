caption: 'FBL is positively regulated upstream by the transcription factor AP-1. (A)
  Bioinformatic analysis predicted that FBL is regulated at the transcriptional level
  by the AP-1 complex downstream of RAS signaling. (B) The addition of the upstream
  FBL inhibitor T-5224 to an HT22 cells model of LPS-induced inflammation, followed
  by real-time RT-PCR. n=3; t–test, ###p < 0.001; n=3; t–test, **p < 0.01. (C) (D)
  Western blot analysis of LPS-treated cells after the addition of the upstream inhibitor
  T-5224. n=3;t–test, ##p < 0.01; n=3; t–test, **p < 0.01.'
