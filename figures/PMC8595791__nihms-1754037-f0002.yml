caption: 'Alterations of signaling pathways in the control and denervated muscle.
  A: representative images and quantifications of phosphorylation of JNK (54 kDa band,
  as indicated by an arrow) in the control and denervated muscle (n=5). B: representative
  images and quantifications of IkB phosphorylation and p52 in the control and denervated
  muscle (n=5). C: representative images and quantifications of phosphorylation of
  ERK (44 kDa band as indicated by an arrow) in the control and denervated muscle
  (n=5). D: representative images of quantifications of phosphorylation of Akt (60
  kDa as indicated by an arrow) in the control and denervated muscle (n=6). Data is
  represented as means ± S.D. analyzed by student’s t-tests.'
