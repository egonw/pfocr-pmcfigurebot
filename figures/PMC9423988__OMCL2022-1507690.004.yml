caption: GSEA results of differential expression genes. (a) GSEA shows that this gene
  is enriched in embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum lumen,
  and RNA polymerase II-specific, and the (bâ€“g) involved pathways are cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway,
  apoptosis, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway.
