caption: Knockdown of MIF and SLC3A2 inhibited the proliferation and migration of
  SW480 and SW620 cells. (A) The OD values of SW480 cells at 450 nm. (B) Immunofluorescence
  assays were performed to detect MIF and SLC3A2 expression in SW480 and SW620 cells.
  (C–D) Transwell assays were performed to measure the migration of SW480 and SW620
  cells. ‘*’ means p < 0.05 when compared with the control group; ‘#’ means p < 0.05
  when compared with the shCon group. GAPDH served as an invariant internal control
  for calculating fold changes in protein expression

  cancer cells via the AKT/GSK‐3β pathway and cell iron death.
