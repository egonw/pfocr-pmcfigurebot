figure_title: Redox stress stimulates TAp73 expression via the CHK1-E2F1 pathway,
  and both CHK1-E2F1 and NRF2-PIRH2 pathways regulate TAp73 and G6PD to promote anchorage-independent
  growth
caption: (A to H) PANC-1 cells treated with control, E2F1, and/or NRF2 siRNAs were
  cultured under indicated conditions. Cells were assayed for protein expression (A
  and H), mRNA levels (B), isotope incorporation (C), NADP+ and NADPH levels (D),
  the NADPH/NADP+ ratio (E), ROS content (F), and viability (G). The isotopic tracing
  experiments in (C) were done together with that in . (I) Schematic diagram shows
  signaling network that regulates G6PD for redox homeostasis. (J to L) PANC-1 cells
  with knockdown of the individual gene were assayed for protein expression (J), adherent
  growth (K), and soft-agar colony formation (L) (related to fig. S7C). (M to O) Control
  and G6PD-overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 cells with or without NADK1 knockdown were assayed
  for protein expression (M), adherent growth (N), and soft-agar colony formation
  (O) (related to fig. S7G). (P and Q) PANC-1 cells with or without NADK1 knockdown
  were assayed for protein expression (P) and soft-agar colony formation (Q) (related
  to fig. S7M). (R) Soft-agar colony formation by control, G6PD-overexpressing, and
  G6PDK171Q-overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 cells. Protein expression is shown in . (S)
  Levels of G6PD and its regulators in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells. (T to V)
  MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were cultured under matrix-detached conditions for the
  indicated durations and assayed for protein expression (T), ROS content (U), and
  viability (V). Data are means ± SD [n = 4 for (B) and 3 for the rest] and are representative
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001; two-way
  ANOVA for (C), (D), (L), (O), and (R) and unpaired Student’s t test for the rest.
