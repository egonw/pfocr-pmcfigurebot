caption: JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitors eliminate the adipose browning induced
  by SPX. The adipocytes were treated with an inhibitor of JAK2 (AZD1480) or an inhibitor
  of STAT3 (stattic). (A ~ D) The protein expression of UCP1, TBX1 and CIDEA treated
  with AZD1480 and stattic. (E) The expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis
  proteins CYT-B. (F) The mRNA expression of UCP1, TBX1 and CIDEA. All values are
  represented as means with error bars representing S.D. In the bar graph, *, P < 0.05;
  **, P < 0.01. n = 6 for each group
article_title: Spexin ameliorated obesity-related metabolic disorders through promoting
  white adipose browning mediated by JAK2-STAT3 pathway.
