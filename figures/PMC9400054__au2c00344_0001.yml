caption: Overall design process to construct a microbial cell factory for the production
  of a target chemical. First, an appropriate microorganism is selected as the microbial
  host. Next, biosynthetic pathways toward target chemical production are examined,
  and the optimal pathway is introduced to the microbial host, accordingly. The microbial
  host harboring the biosynthetic pathway is subject to systems metabolic engineering
  to improve strain performance.
