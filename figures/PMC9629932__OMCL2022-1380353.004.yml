caption: Relative protein expression levels indicating more active intracellular signaling
  and inflammatory responses in hypertrophic LF cells. (a) Protein expression of the
  p-p38/MAPK pathway and inflammatory and fibrotic markers determined through Western
  blotting. (b) Under oxidative stress, the protein expression ratio of iNOS increased
  only in the hypertrophic LF cells. (c) The protein expression ratio of p-p38 exhibited
  a dramatic increase in both the hypertrophic and healthy LF cells after H2O2-induced
  oxidative stress. (d) The expression of α-SMA did not increase after 30 min of H2O2
  treatment in either group (n = 5; ∗p < 0.05 compared with the LDH control group
  or LSS control group; ∗∗p < 0.01 compared with the LDH control group or LSS control
  group; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the LDH control group; values were derived from
  a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test).
