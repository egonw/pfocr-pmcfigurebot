caption: The molecular function and mechanism of the senescence-metabolism-related
  risk model (SeMRM) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). (A) Senescence metabolism-related
  risk score (SeMRM) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the renal cancer progression
  signaling pathway. P < 0. 05 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0. 05 were considered
  significant. (B) Comparison of the heatmaps of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  between the high-SeMRM group and the low-SeMRM group. P < 0. 05,| FC| > 1. 5. (C)
  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to explore the molecular functions and biological
  processes of these DEGs. (D) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis
  revealed the main pathways involved in these DEGs. (E) Gene sets related to amino
  acid metabolism in high or low SeMRM subgroups (p < 0. 05, FDR < 0. 25). (F) Gene
  sets related to lipid metabolism in high or low SeMRM subgroups (p < 0. 05, FDR < 0.
