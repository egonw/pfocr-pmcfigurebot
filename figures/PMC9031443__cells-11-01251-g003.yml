caption: Schematic pathway of EBI2 receptor activation in cells that express this
  receptor. 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, a ligand of EBI2 (Epstein–Barr-virus-induced
  molecule-2), activates the GTPases family and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and P38 to intracellular calcium flux. In the nucleus,
  GTPases stimulate the expression of SRE (Serum Response Element) and the expression
  of NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) (weak stimulation),
  and inhibit the expression of CREB (cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein), downregulating
  the production of cAMP (cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) [,].
