caption: Anthocyanin-related genes were positively correlated with JF. (A) Heatmap
  of anthocyanin-related genes from mRNA-seq. Z-scores for each gene were used. Numbers
  in sample names indicate biological replicate number. (B) RT-PCR of anthocyanin
  biosynthetic genes. General indicates general pathway genes in flavonoid biosynthetic
  pathway, EBG indicates early biosynthetic genes, and LBG indicates late biosynthetic
  genes. StACT1 was used as an internal control. (C–G) qRT-PCR of anthocyanin-related
  genes. Relative expression levels of each gene were determined by 2−ΔΔCT method.
  Letters represent significant differences based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test
  (p < 0.05). Two biological replicates were analyzed. (C) Relative expression level
  of StCHS. (D) Relative expression level of StF3′5′H. (E) Relative expression level
  of StDFR. (F) Relative expression level of StA5OGT. (G) Relative expression level
  of StTT8. (H) Linear regression analysis between qRT-PCR expression and mRNA-seq
  data. Relative expression levels of each gene were determined by 2−ΔΔCT method,
  as indicated in the x axis, while the TMM-normalized TPM of target genes divided
  by that of StACT1 is indicated in the y axis.
