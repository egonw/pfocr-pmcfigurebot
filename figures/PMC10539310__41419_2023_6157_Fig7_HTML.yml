  signaling cascade in BLBC cells
caption: 'A Total ATP quantification of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells.
  B Extracellular lactate quantification of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806
  and HCC1937 cells. C, D Glucose stress test via measuring the extracellular acidification
  rate (ECAR) in siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 and HCC1937 cells. glu: glucose,
  oligo: oligomycin, 2-DG: 2-deoxyglucose. E Glycolysis capacity of siControl- and
  siRNF40-treated HCC1806 and HCC1937 cells under basal state or oligomycin treatment.
  F Western blot analysis of phospho-AMPK (S172) and total AMPK levels in siControl-
  and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells. G Western blot analysis of phospho-YAP1 (S127)
  and actin levels in HCC1806 cells with increasing doses of 2-DG. H TEAD-driven luciferase
  reporter assay of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells, without and with
  AMPKi. I Western blot analysis of phospho-YAP1 (S127), total YAP1 and actin in siControl-
  and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells, without or with AMPKi. Proliferation kinetics
  of siControl- and siRNF40-treated HCC1806 cells, without or with an AMPK-specific
  siRNA (J) or AMPKi (K). L Colony formation assay of siControl- and siRNF40-treated
  HCC1806 cells, without or with AMPKi. M Overall survival (OS) and progression-free
  interval (PFI) analysis of (PRKAA1 + PRKAA2)high- and (PRKAA1 + PRKAA2)low-expressing
  BLBC patients. TCGA-BRCA-derived patient survival data were retrieved from https://xenabrowser.net/.
  N GSEA profile of the homemade “AMPK_ACTIVATION_VIA_AICAR_DN” gene set (accession
  number: GSE65634) significantly enriched in RNF40high-expressing BLBC patients and
  siControl-treated HCC1806 cells. O Graphical summary of the RNF40-dependent glycolytic
  pathway suppressing the AMPK/Hippo axis, thereby promoting the YAP1-driven aggressive
  behavior of BLBC (Created with BioRender.com). CSC: Cancer Stem Cell. L-M source

  Statistical test: Student t-test (A–E), One-way Anova (H, J–L). C, D and J, K statistical
  analysis based on the area under the curve (AUC). *p-val < 0.05, **p-val < 0.01,
  ***p-val < 0.005. Error bars: Standard error of the mean (SEM). All experiments
  were performed in biological triplicates per condition.'
