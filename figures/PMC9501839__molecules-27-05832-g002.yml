caption: Plasma suppressed MM-cell-colony-formation abilities by increasing ROS. (A)
  RPMI8226, MMS-1, and LP-1 cells were pretreated with the ROS scavenger NAC (200
  μM), and then treated with He and Ar plasma for 20 s, followed by incubation with
  10 μM DCFH-DA for 20 min. DCF fluorescence was examined and quantified, ROS levels
  were measured at (B) 0 h, (C) 4 h, and (D) 24 h after plasma treatment. (E) Cells
  had been treated with NAC and plasma were then plated in CFC assays to assess clonogenic
  ability. Data represent the mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
