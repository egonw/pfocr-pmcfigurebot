caption: PON1 negatively regulates the type I IFN signaling pathway. (A) The knockdown
  of PON1 expression increases the expression of IFN-β and several ISGs. PAMs were
  transfected with PON1-specific siRNA-1 and a negative control for 24 h, and the
  mRNA levels of IFN-β, ISG15, OASL, and GBP1 were determined by qPCR. (B) PON1 overexpression
  results in decreased expression of IFN-β and several ISGs. Lentivirus was used to
  mediate the overexpression of PON1 in PAM for 24 h, and mRNA levels of IFN-β, ISG15,
  OASL, and GBP1 were determined by qPCR. (C) PON1 activator results in decreased
  expression of IFN-β and several ISGs. PAMs were treated with 40 μM fenofibrate for
  24 h and then infected with Sendai Virus (SeV) for 6 h, and the mRNA levels of PON1
  were determined by qPCR. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *, p < 0.05; **, p
  < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. The p-value was calculated using a Student’s t-test (two-tails).
