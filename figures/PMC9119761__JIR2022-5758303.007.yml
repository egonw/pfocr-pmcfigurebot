caption: Effect of LBAG on the cell apoptosis of H/R-injured H9c2 cells. (a, b) Representative
  photographs of flow cytometry using FITC/PI double staining in H/R-injured H9c2
  cells treated with LBAG. (c, d) Representative photographs of TUNEL assay in LBAG-treated
  H/R-injured H9c2 cells. Apoptosis index significantly decreased following LBAG treatment
  in H/R-injured cardiomyocytes. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group. ▲P <
  0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. H/R group. No significance (ns) vs. 10 μmol/L LBAG group.
