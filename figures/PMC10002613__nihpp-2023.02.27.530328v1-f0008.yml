figure_title: 'Model: SDPN-1/PXF-1 regulates endosomal actomyosin via RAP-1 to RHO-1
  signaling to regulate fission of recycling tubules'
caption: A schematic of the genetic interactions of key players for recycling tubule
  fission and physical model for how these players enact tubule fission. Recycling
  tubules pulled from sorting endosomes require non-muscle myosin NMY-2 to promote
  recycling, likely by creating actomyosin tension on the tubule neck. The F-BAR protein
  SDPN-1/Syndapin and its binding partner PXF-1 further regulates tension, acting
  through a RAP-1/Rap signaling pathway to restrain the level of RHO-1/RhoA and non-muscle
  myosin NMY-1 activity on the endosome. Such negative regulation is required for
  successful recycling. Created with BioRender.com.
