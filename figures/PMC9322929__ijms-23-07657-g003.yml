caption: The expression levels of CSC markers in HCC cells are decreased by JIB-04.
  (A) The mRNA expression of cancer stem cell marker genes was analyzed using qRT-PCR
  in PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, and HepG2 cultures after treatment with DMSO (control), 6 μM
  JIB-04, or 4 μM TSA (positive control) for 24 h. All data are normalized to GAPDH
  and plotted relative to the expression level in control cells. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM derived from triplicate measurements (n = 3); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  and *** p < 0.001. (B) (Top panels) Protein levels of CD133, CD44, LGR5, and EpCAM
  in HCC cells after treatment with 6 μM JIB-04 for 48 h were confirmed with Western
  blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (Bottom panels) Quantification
  based on densitometry of Western blotting data from top panels in (B). All data
  are normalized to GAPDH. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of triplicate measurements;
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01.
