caption: CAPE blocks the levels of IL-1β-induced inflammatory mediators in human chondrocytes.
  (A) The mRNA expression of COX-2 and iNOS was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. The protein expression of COX2 and iNOS was (B) detected using western blotting
  and (C) quantified. (D) The production of nitric oxide was detected via the Griess
  reaction. (E) The production of prostaglandin E2 was detected using ELISA. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001. CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; COX-2,
  cyclooxygenase-2; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase.
article_title: Caffeic acid phenethyl ester attenuates osteoarthritis progression
  by activating NRF2/HO-1 and inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway.
