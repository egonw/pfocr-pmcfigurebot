caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs). (a) Upregulated genes and (b) downregulated genes. PPI pairs were imported
  into Cytoscape software as described in Methods. Red nodes represent upregulated
  genes while green nodes represent downregulated genes. The lines represent the interactive
  relationship between nodes. The highlighted DEGs represent a degree of â‰¥2.
