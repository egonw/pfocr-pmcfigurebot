caption: Overview of the main classes and pathways of KEGG. (A) KEGG subclass categories
  of differential metabolites. (B) KEGG subclass enrichment of differential metabolites.
  (C) KEGG pathway categories of differential metabolites. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment
  of differential metabolites. The abscissa represents the rich factor corresponding
  to each main class. The ordinate is the class name. The colorbar is p value. The
  redder it is, the more significant.
