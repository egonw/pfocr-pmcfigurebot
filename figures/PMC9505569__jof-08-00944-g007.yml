caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of differential metabolites between the CK and FR
  comparison groups (Leaf-CK vs. Leaf-FR, Root-CK vs. Root-FR). (a) represent leaves
  and (b) represent roots. Each bubble in the plot represents a metabolic pathway;
  the abscissa and the bubble size jointly indicate the magnitude of impact. A larger
  bubble shows more metabolites are enriched; the bubble color represents the p-value
  of the enrichment analysis, with darker colors indicating a higher degree of enrichment.
