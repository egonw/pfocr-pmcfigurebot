figure_title: Scheme for BioH action in mycobacterial biotin biosynthetic pathway
caption: 'A. Genetic environment of bioH homologs in different microorganisms. The
  dots denote the conserved sequence motifs recognized by the regulatory protein (e.g.,
  BirA and/or BioQ, shown in cyan background). The two discontinued loci are separated
  with the double slash. The bioC is colored green, and the bioH homolog is highlighted
  in purple. B. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis for expression of three
  putative BioH paralogs (bioH1 to bioH3) Namely, the three bioH isoforms included
  bioH1 (MSMEG_2036), bioH2 (MSMEG_1352), and bioH3 (MSMEG_6710). sigA encoding sigma
  A functions as an interference gene. Ct (cycle threshold) is used to measure the
  amplification cycles of target genes during the qPCR. C. Use of conformationally-sensitive
  0.5M urea/PAGE (17.5%, pH9.5) to separate reactant M-pim-ACP and its hydrolytic
  product pim-ACP The minus “—” denotes no addition of either BioH or BioJ enzyme.
  D. The schematic representative of the “BioC-BioH” pathway of biotin synthesis.
  E. A scheme for multi-target biotinylation by Bpl in M. smegmatis. Unlike that in
  E. coli AccB (colored gray) is the only biotinylated enzyme, M. smegmatis is proposed
  to contain no less than five target proteins (colored pink) modified by Bpl. F.
  Sequence signature of the protein biotinylation by Bpl. G. Bacterial viability-based
  determination for minimum physiological demand for biotin in M. smegmatis MC2 155.
