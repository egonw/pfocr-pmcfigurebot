caption: 'Silencing of SETDB1 inhibits PD-L1 expression and facilitates the T cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity to tumor cells via the FOSB/miR-22/BATF3 axis. (a) The expression of
  SETDB1, FOSB, miR-22, BATF3, and PD-L1 in SW480 cells treated with sh-SETDB1 or
  combined with OE-BATF3 determined by RT-qPCR. (b) The protein expression of SETDB1,
  FOSB, BATF3, and PD-L1 in SW480 cells treated with sh-SETDB1 or combined with OE-BATF3
  normalized to GAPDH determined by Western blot analysis. (c) T cell cytotoxicity
  determined by the LDH test kit following treatment with sh-SETDB1 or combined with
  OE-BATF3. (d) The viability of SW480 cells treated with sh-SETDB1 or combined with
  OE-BATF3 detected by CCK-8 assay. (e) The content of IL-2 in the cell supernatant
  following treatment with sh-SETDB1 or combined with OE-BATF3 determined by ELISA.
  âˆ—p < 0.05vs. SW480 cells treated with sh-NC+OE-NC. #p < 0.05vs. SW480 cells treated
  with sh-SETDB1-1+OE-NC. The cell experiment was run in triplicate independently.'
