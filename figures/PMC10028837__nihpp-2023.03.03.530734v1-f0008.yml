figure_title: Evidence for reversal of teichoic acid-associated phenotypes in the
  pgl mutant by vraF and vraG mutations
caption: A. Comparison of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) Alexa Fluor 594 binding to JE2,
  pgl, pglcomp, pgl::Kmr, vraG, vraF, graR, putA, pgl/vraG, pgl/vraF, pgl/graR, pgl/putA,
  pgl/putA/vraG and pglR1 cells grown for 4.5 h in CDMG OX using fluorescence microscopy
  at 594nm excitation/618nm detection. The data are the average of 3 independent experiments
  and error bars represent standard deviation. Significant differences were determined
  using a two-way ANOVA with Turkey’s post-hoc analysis. Adjusted p-values **** p<0.0001
  or ns, not significant are indicated. B. Mutation of vraG partially restores Congo
  red resistance in the pgl mutant. 10-fold serial dilutions of JE2, pgl, pglcomp,
  vraG and pgl/vraG inoculated onto TSA supplemented with 0.125% Congo red and grown
  for 24 h at 37°C. This experiment was repeated three times and a representative
  plate is shown.
