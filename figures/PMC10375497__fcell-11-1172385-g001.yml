caption: Transcriptomic features of HEF and P-HAF cells. (A) Morphology of HEF and
  P-HAF (scale bars, 100 μm). (B) DEGs analysis of HEF and P-HAF cells. (C) GO analysis
  of the DEGs between HEF and P-HAF. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between HEF
  and P-HAF. (E) GSEA showing enriched GO-BP terms for upregulated DEGs and downregulated
  DEGs, respectively. (F) DEGs (|log2 (fold change)| > 1, FDR< 0.05) related to the
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are shown in the heatmap. (G) Network of candidate targets
  in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
