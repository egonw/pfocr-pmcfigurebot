caption: 'The current study depicts different Lys-manipulated mechanisms on the Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  and myogenic differentiation in fast (semimembranosus) and slow (semitendinosus)
  muscle and satellites cells. Lys deficiency stimulates the Wnt/Ca2+pathway and myogenic
  differentiation in fast muscle, while it suppresses these biological processes in
  slow muscle. (SC: satellite cells; MyoG: myogenin; MRF4: myogenic regulatory factor
  4; PKC: protein kinase C, CaN: calcineurin; CaMKII: calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T; PLC: phospholipase C; DVL:
  disheveled).'
