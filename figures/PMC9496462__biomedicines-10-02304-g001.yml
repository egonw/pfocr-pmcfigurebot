caption: 'The NF-κB IMD pathway in Drosophila. IMD is activated through the recognition
  of Gram-negative bacteria-derived meso diaminopymelic-type (DAP-type) peptidoglycan
  (PGN) and tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) by the Peptidoglycan recognition (PGRP) domain
  of Peptidoglycan recognition protein -LC and -LE (PGRP LC, -LE). PGRP-LC and -LE
  death-domains recruit immune deficiency (IMD), FAS-associated death domain (FADD)
  and death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (Dredd). A ubiquitin-ligase complex formed
  by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (DIAP2) and the E2
  ubiquitin conjugating Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant 1A (Uev1a), Bendless
  and Effete activates Dredd by K63-linked poly ubiquitinylation. Activated Dredd
  cleaves IMD N-terminal domain, leading to the recruitment of transforming growth
  factor beta (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-associated binding protein
  2 (TAB2). TAK1 is able to activate the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex
  formed of IKKβ and IKKγ subunits. Phosphorylated IKKβ is sumoylated by Leswright
  and phosphorylates the N-terminal portion of the NF-κB factor Relish to enable its
  transcriptional activity. Relish is separated from its IκB-like C-terminal ankyrin
  repeat region by Dredd through proteolytic cleavage. The NLS-containing N-terminal
  portion of Relish (Rel-68) is then imported to the nucleus while the IκB-like C-terminal
  portion (Rel-49) remains in the cytoplasm. Rel68 homodimers bind their cognate κB
  Response element, the consensus sequence 5′-GGGGATTYYY-3′ (Y: C or T) and activate
  IMD-pathway target genes with the help of the nuclear protein Akirin, which needs
  to be ubiquitinated by the E3-ligase Hyd beforehand. Dotted arrows indicate the
  activity of key cleaved proteins of the pathway (IMD, Relish), while continuous
  arrows are used for the other proteins. Negative regulators are highlighted in red.'
