caption: 'Cancer cachexia is associated with decrease in MAFbx protein expression
  in pectoralis major muscle. (A) Protein expression levels of two markers of the
  proteasome‐mediated degradation pathway: MuRF1 and MAFbx, measured in pectoralis
  major biopsies from noncachectic patients (NC), patients with mild cachexia (MC),
  or severe cachexia (SC). (B) Spearman correlation between the protein expression
  level of MAFbx and the skeletal muscle index (SMI). (C) Protein expression levels
  of three markers of autophagic proteolysis: Beclin, p62, and LC3BI. Protein expression
  levels were determined by western blot and normalized to Tubulin. Data are presented
  with IQR box and min‐to‐max whiskers and were compared using Kruskal–Wallis tests
  with Dunn''s post hoc tests. Outliers were excluded using Grubbs'' test α = 0.05.
  Men: black dots, women: white triangles. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
