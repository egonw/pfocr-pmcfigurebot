caption: Gene‐set analysis of fibrotic progression in pediatric patients with NAFLD.
  (A) PLS‐DA of S0 versus S3 patients in this study. (B) 939 DEGs were differentially
  regulated in S0 versus S3. A total of 500 were significantly up‐regulated; 439 were
  significantly down‐regulated. Genes of interest are marked. (C) Top 10 enriched
  biological pathways in NAFLD S0 versus S3 by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), ranked
  by p‐value. (D) Normalized expression of a 20‐protein coding gene set in different
  stages of fibrosis within NAFLD. All 20 genes are significantly regulated (p < 0.05)
  compared with NAFLD S0. (E) Normalized expression of selected genes related to inflammation
  and immune cell activation. Genes are significantly up‐regulated (p < 0.05) between
  S0 and S3. Z‐score represents normalized expression. EIF2, eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin
