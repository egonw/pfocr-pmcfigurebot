caption: MYC-dependent control of gene expression and synthetic lethality partners
  of MYC. In response to mitogenic stimuli, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway triggers MYC-dependent
  gene expression of enzymes involved in the control of glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
  nucleotide metabolism, unfolded protein response, general protein synthesis, and
  ribosomal protein synthesis, many of which were identified as synthetic lethality
  partners of MYC (indicated as pink shadows). For example, CDK9 and CDK12, which
  control the mRNA elongation by RNA polymerase II via phosphorylation of the CTD
  domain of the enzyme, were identified as MYC-SL partners. Regulators of MYC stability
  that prevent the proteasomal degradation of the protein, and four DDR components,
  namely ATR, CHK1, CDK1, and DNA-PKcs, also constitute a pool of MYC-SL partners.
