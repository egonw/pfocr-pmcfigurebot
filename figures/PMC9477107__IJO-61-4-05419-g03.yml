caption: LIS1 enhances tumor growth in a SACC xenograft mouse model. (A) Schematic
  representation of the animal model establishment. A total of 40 nude mice were randomly
  divided into two sections, one for nude mouse xenograft tumors and the other for
  metastasis models. For xenograft models, 1×107 cells in 100 µl PBS were subcutaneously
  injected into the right flank of mice (n=5 per group). Subsequently, one month later,
  the xenograft tumors were removed. (B) Images of xenograft tumors harvested from
  nude mice following injection of tumor cells (vector, LIS1 overexpression, sh-Control
  and sh-LIS1 cells). (C) The volume of xenograft tumors was measured every five days,
  and the changes in the tumor weight of mice wered recorded. (D) The weight of xenograft
  tumors was measured when the xenografts were removed 35 days after injection of
  the tumor cells. (E) A TUNEL assay was performed to assess cell apoptosis in the
  tumor tissues, and the expression of Ki67 in xenograft tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry.
  Scale bar, 100 µm. (F) Quantitative statistical analysis of TUNEL assay results.
  (G) Quantitative statistics for the percentage of Ki67-positive cells. Mean ± SEM;
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1, lissencephaly 1; SACC, salivary gland adenoid
  cystic carcinoma; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sh-, short hairpin RNA; TUNEL,
  terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling.
