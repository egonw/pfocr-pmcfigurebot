caption: Validation for the interaction of HSP90AA1 with CSFV NS5A protein. (A) Identification
  of the colocalization of HSP90AA1 with NS5A protein in 293T cells. 293T cells co-expressing
  pEGFP-NS5A and p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 were analyzed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.
  293T Cells were co-transfected with pEGFP and p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 and pEGFP-NS5A with
  p3×Flag-CMV as negative controls. (B) Exogenous Co-IP analysis of NS5A with HSP90AA1
  in 293T cells. 293T cells were co-transfected with p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 and EGFP-NS5A.
  293T Cells were co-transfected with pEGFP and p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 and pEGFP-NS5A with
  p3×Flag-CMV as negative controls. (C, D) Identification of the colocalization of
  HSP90AA1 with NS5A protein in PK and 3D4/2 cells. PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells co-expressing
  pEGFP-NS5A and p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 were analyzed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.
  PK-15 and 3D4/2 Cells were co-transfected with pEGFP and p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 and pEGFP-NS5A
  with p3×Flag-CMV as negative controls.
