figure_title: Critical modulators involved in TDE biogenesis and secretion
caption: The biogenesis of TDEs begins with early endosomes budding inward to form
  the MVB, which depends on ESCRT complexes or through the ESCRT-independent pathway
  based on nSMase2. Subsequently, MVBs fuse with lysosomes for degradation or are
  docked to the cell periphery with the favor of Rab GTPases for secretion. Finally,
  SNARE complexes drive membrane fusion for TDE release.
