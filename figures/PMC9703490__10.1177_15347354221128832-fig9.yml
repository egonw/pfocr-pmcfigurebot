caption: (A) The graphical representation of % of total wound closure in the A549
  cell line after 24 hours of treatment of EELDP (0-0.3 mg/ml) without and with NF-κB
  inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (0-10 µM). Each bar represents the mean with standard deviation
  from 3 independent experiments. (B) Protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB
  from total protein extract of A549 cells after 24 hours of treatment of EELDP (0-0.3 mg/ml)
  or BAY 11-7082 (0-10 µM) or in combination. From left to right columns indicated
  as control (0.0), 0.1 mg/ml EELDP, BAY 5 µM, 0.1 mg/ml EELDP with BAY 5 µM, 0.3 mg/ml
  EELDP, 0.3 mg/ml EELDP with BAY 5 µM, BAY 10 µM, 0.1 mg/ml EELDP with BAY 10 µM,
  0.3 mg/ml EELDP with BAY 10 µM respectively. The lower panel is the internal control
  β-actin. Here “***” defines P ≤ 0.001.
