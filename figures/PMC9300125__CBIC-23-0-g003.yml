caption: 'Overview of the discussed methods for mutagenic library creation, gene‐
  and pathway assembly, and library analysis. A) Oligo pool‐based methods to generate
  protein libraries, gene fragment libraries, or pathways. 1) Single residue saturation
  mutagenic libraries, such as those used for deep‐mutational scanning, can be created
  from oligo pools by Nicking Mutagenesis (NM),[, ] programmed allelic series (PALS),
  plasmid recombineering (PR) or CRISPR‐enabled trackable Genome engineering (CREATE).
  2) Libraries where short DNA stretches are comprehensively inserted, such as required
  for protein minimization, have been created by PR and can likely be created by NM,
  PALS, and CREATE. Single‐residue deletion libraries have been created by PALS. 3) Complex
  pools of many different proteins fragments can be created by multiple pairwise assembly
  and DropSynth.[, ] 4) Larger genes and pathways can be assembled as shown by Wan
  et al. B) Library sequence analysis: The quality of libraries needs to be analyzed
  for the frequency of programmed mutations (red dot) and the frequency of off‐target
  mutations (cross). 1) Short‐read sequencing – as offered via Illumina‐based services
  – is highly accurate, high in throughput, and widely accessible but the short read‐length
  leads to a narrow resolution window. Libraries need to be tiled to be accurately
  quality controlled, as off‐target mutations outside the resolution window are otherwise
  invisible. 2) Molecular barcoding and computational assembly can overcome the limited
  read length in NGS as full‐length sequences of mutagenized clones can be obtained
  from short NGS reads. 3) Single‐molecule real‐time (SMRT) long‐read sequencing,
  followed by computational error correction or combined with variant‐concatenation[,
  ] starts to allow long‐read sequencing for library quality control in protein engineering.'
