caption: 'W112 treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of NF-κB signaling pathway
  in Aβ25–35-induced cell and rat models. (A,B) The phosphorylation and total levels
  of NF-κB in PC12 cells were measured by Western blot. n = 3. (C,D) The phosphorylation
  and total levels of NF-κB in the hippocampus were measured by Western blot. n =
  8. ## p < 0.01 vs. the control group; ** p < 0.01 vs. the model group.'
