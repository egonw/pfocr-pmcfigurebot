caption: Effect of in vitro treatment of granulocytes with RAPA on phagocytosis signaling
  pathways and cell phagocytosis. (A) Both red, green, and deep blue shading boxes
  represent molecules of the phagocytosis pathway identified in head kidney granulocytes
  of largemouth bass. Additionally, the red boxes indicate the upregulated DEGs in
  this pathway, the green boxes indicate the downregulated DEGs in this pathway, and
  the deep blue boxes indicate both upregulated and downregulated DEGs in this pathway.
  (B) Differential expression genes involved in the phagocytosis pathway were analyzed
  after RAPA treatment. The color gradient represents highly upregulated (red) and
  highly downregulated (green) genes. (C,D) Representative flow cytometry dot plot
  showing phagocytosis of granulocytes treated with DMSO (C) or RAPA (D). Phag−, nonphagocytic;
  Phag+, phagocytic. “Low” indicates phagocytic granulocytes internalizing one bead,
  and “High” represents phagocytic granulocytes internalizing two or more beads. (E)
  The ratio of phagocytic granulocytes from granulocyte populations treated with DMSO
  or RAPA (n = 6 fish/group). (F) The ratio of high-phagocytic granulocytes internalizing
  two or more beads from phagocytic granulocyte populations treated with DMSO or RAPA
  (n = 6 fish/group). Statistical differences were determined by a paired Student’s
  t-test. Data in (E,F) are representative of at least three independent experiments
  (mean ± SEM). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
