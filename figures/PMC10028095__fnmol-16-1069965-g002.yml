caption: 'EA regulates the inflammatory response in the synovium of KOA rats. The
  features of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of the synovitis in the model
  group compared with those of the EA group. (A) DEP profiles were hierarchically
  clustered and shown as a heatmap wherein 222 proteins were up-regulated (red) or
  down-regulated (blue). (B) Gene ontology analysis of DEPs: Enriched with terms of
  response to cytokine, positive regulation of extrinsic apoptotic, signaling pathway,
  acute-phase response, stress−activated MAPK cascade, positive regulation of Fc-gamma
  receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis, and negative regulation of
  cytokine−mediated signaling pathway. (C) Gene ontology analysis of DEPs: Enriched
  in terms related to immune regulation and response (n = 8): cellular response to
  IL-6, negative regulation of interleukin-1 beta production, negative regulation
  of cytokine-mediated signal pathway, the regulation of innate immune response, leukocyte
  migration involved in the inflammatory response, positive regulation of inflammatory
  response, activation of MAPKK activity, and regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 Cascade.'
