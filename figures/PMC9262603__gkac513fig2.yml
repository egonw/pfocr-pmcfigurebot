caption: 'JAK-STAT signaling is required for the temperature-controlled increase of
  antiviral genes. (A) The canonical antiviral cascade, also required for defense
  against SARS-CoV-2, leading to the type I interferon response is shown (created
  with BioRender.com). Components at all steps of this pathway are activated at 38°C;
  the expression of all genes shown in color was increased in the RNA-seq experiment
  in Figure  (genes shown in gray were not changed). For RT-qPCR validation, RAW 264.7
  cells were incubated at the indicated temperature for 12 h and gene expression was
  analyzed (n = 3, mean ± SD). All genes with a predicted increase in expression at
  38°C in the RNA-seq data were confirmed by RT-qPCR (validation rate 100%). (B) RAW 264.7
  cells were incubated at the indicated temperature for 12 h and gene expression was
  analyzed by RT-qPCR. mRNA expression is relative to Hprt (n = 3, mean ± SD). (C)
  Elevated temperature is sufficient to induce JAK-STAT signaling. RAW 264.7 cells
  were incubated at the indicated temperature for 12 h and phosphorylation (activation)
  of STAT2 was analyzed by western blot (n = 3, mean ± SD). As positive control, cells
  were incubated for 16 h with LPS (2.25 μg/ml) (n = 2, mean ± SD). A representative
  blot and quantification of three independent experiments are shown. hnRNP-L served
  as a loading control. (D) Western blot as in panel (C) showing increased expression
  of Stat2 also at the protein level. A representative blot and quantification relative
  to hnRNP-L are shown (n = 3). (E) Western blot as in panel (B) showing increased
  expression of RIG-I (Ddx58) also at the protein level. A representative blot and
  quantification relative to hnRNP-L are shown. (F) Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling
  abolishes temperature-induced increased expression of antiviral genes and reduces
  their basal expression. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in the absence (DMSO) or
  presence of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib for 6 h at 37°C and then at the indicated
  temperature for 12 h. Expression of the indicated genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  mRNA expression is relative to Hprt (n = 3, mean ± SD). Statistical significance
  was determined by unpaired t-tests and is indicated by asterisks: *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01;
  ***P< 0.001; ns = not significant.'
