caption: 'TAZ inhibited the inflammatory response by enhancing antioxidant capacity(A
  and B) Measurement of MDA and 8-OHdG levels after introduction of the TAZ overexpression
  plasmid and addition of LPS. N = 6. (C and D) Regulation of TAZ overexpression on
  intracellular ROS and O2− after exposure to LPS. N = 3. (E and F) Effects of TAZ
  overexpression on the activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GPX, and GR
  in the context of LPS. N = 4. (G and H) GSH content and the GSH/GSSG ratio were
  determined after introduction of the TAZ overexpression plasmid and addition of
  LPS. N = 4. (I and J) Blockage of antioxidant enzymes and GSH synthesis by the corresponding
  inhibitors antagonized alleviation of TAZ on MDA and 8-OHdG levels. After introduction
  of the TAZ overexpression plasmid, MDA and 8-OHdG levels were analyzed in the presence
  or absence of the SOD inhibitor DDC, the CAT inhibitor 3AT, the GPX inhibitor MSA,
  the GR inhibitor BCNU, or the GSH synthesis inhibitor BSO in the context of LPS.
  N = 6. (K–M) Repression of antioxidant enzymes and GSH synthesis neutralized recovery
  of TAZ on the levels for IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA. N = 6. (N–P) Impediment of
  antioxidant enzymes and GSH synthesis counteracted rescue of TAZ on the release
  of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. N = 6. ∗p < 0.05 versus control in one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s post hoc test, #p < 0.05 versus LPS treatment in one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post hoc test, &p < 0.05 versus transfection with the TAZ overexpression plasmid
  followed by addition of LPS in one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.'
