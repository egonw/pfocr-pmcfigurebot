caption: GSEA of the MSigDB (A) hallmark and (B) canonical gene sets comparing subjects
  with JDM at baseline with healthy controls. NESs more than 0 signify enrichment
  in JDM, and NESs less than 0 signify enrichment in controls. All significant hallmark
  pathways are shown. The 50 most significant canonical pathways are shown. Dot size
  corresponds to the number of genes in the pathway. Dot color corresponds to the
  adjusted significance of the pathway. B, Biocarta; FDR, false discovery rate; GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; JDM, juvenile dermatomyositis; K, KEGG; NES, normalized
  enrichment score; PID, Pathways Interaction Database; R, Reactome.
