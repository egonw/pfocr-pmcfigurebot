caption: 'Representative images of protein expression levels (Western Blot) for all
  proteins studied, their regulatory phosphorylations and total amount of protein
  loaded (Reactive Brown Staining) for a single study participant. Images from top
  to bottom: pThr287 CaMKII, Total CaMKII, pThr180/Tyr182 p38 MAPK, pThr202/Tyr204
  ERK1/2, NF-κB p105, NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, pSer536 NF-κB p65, pSer32/36 IκBα, Total
  IκBα, pThr19/Ser23 IκBß, Total IκBß, pSer176/180 IKKα/β, Total IKKβ, Total IKKα,
  GR, Txr1, Gpx1, TrxR1 and Reactive Brown (as total protein loading control). Detailed
  description of experimental phases is included in . CON, non-intervention healthy
  human sample included in quadruplicate onto each gel as a loading control. Normoxia;
  test performed with FIO2 = 0.21, Hypoxia; test performed with FIO2 = 0.104; Pre,
  before exercise; Post, 10 s after the end of exercise with ischaemic recovery; Oc1m,
  60 s after the end of exercise with ischaemic recovery; FC1m, 60 s after the end
  of exercise without ischaemic recovery (free circulation). The molecular weight
  standard markers closest to the migration of the band are indicated on the right
  side of the panel.'
