caption: The association analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome.
  (A) The Venn of cold-responsive phosphopeptides and cold-responsive proteins; (B)
  the Venn of EBR-regulated cold-responsive phosphopeptides and EBR-regulated cold-responsive
  proteins; (C) the Venn of EBR-regulated non-cold-responsive phosphopeptides and
  EBR-regulated non-cold-responsive proteins; (D) the cold-responsive protein content
  between cold-up and cold-down phosphoproteins; (E) the EBR-regulated cold-responsive
  protein content between EBR-upregulated cold and EBR-downregulated cold-responsive
  phosphoproteins; (F) the EBR-regulated non-cold protein content between EBR-upregulated
  non-cold and EBR-downregulated non-cold phosphoproteins; (G) the Venn of KEGG pathway
  between differential phosphoproteins and proteins; (H) the network construction
  of cold TFs and its corresponding cold target mRNA; and (I) the expression of hormone
  signaling pathway genes under cold stress. The "***" indicates significantly different
  (p < 0.001 by Tukey’s test), and "****" indicates significantly different (p < 0.0001
  by Tukey’s test).
