caption: 9-butyl-harmol enhanced the IFN-β-mediated immune response through the activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, by targeting GSK-3β. (A and B) The accumulation of
  β-catenin in the nucleus of 9-butyl-harmol treated cells. DF-1 cells were treated
  with 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM). At 24 h posttreatment, the subcellular localization
  of β-catenin was detected via immunofluorescence microscopy (A) or Western blotting
  (B). (C) 9-butyl-harmol activates the activity of TOPFlash. DF-1 cells were transfected
  with TOPFlash or FOPFlash together with pRL-TK. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells
  were incubated with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM). At 24 h postincubation, the cells
  were harvested for the quantification of the luciferase activity (TOP/FOP). Mean
  values ± SDs are shown (n = 5). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired
  Student’s t tests. **, P < 0.01. (D) 9-butyl-harmol promotes the chicken IFN-β promoter
  activity. DF-1 cells were transfected with chicken IFN-β-luc and pRL-TK. At 24 h
  posttransfection, the cells were infected with (right panel) or without (left panel)
  F48E9 (0.01 MOI) and then incubated with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM). At 24 h
  postincubation, the cells were harvested for the quantification of the luciferase
  activity. Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 5). Significance was assessed via two-tailed,
  unpaired Student’s t tests. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. (E) 9-butyl-harmol promotes
  the expression of IFN-β. DF-1 cells were infected with (right panel) or without
  (left panel) F48E9 (0.01 MOI) and then incubated with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (5 μM).
  At 24 h postincubation, the cells were harvested to quantify the expression of IFN-β
  via qRT-PCR. Mean values ± SDs are shown (n = 4). Significance was assessed via
  two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. (F) Molecular
  docking simulation of the binding of 9-butyl-harmol to GSK-3β. (G) 9-butyl-harmol
  protects GSK-3β from degradation due to heating. DF-1 cells were harvested and treated
  with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (200 μM). The thermal stability of GSK-3β was assessed
  via CETSA (left panel). The relative quantification of the target protein level
  was analyzed via ImageJ (right). (H) 9-butyl-harmol protects GSK-3β against proteolysis.
  DF-1 cells were harvested and treated with DMSO or 9-butyl-harmol (200 μM). The
  stability of GSK-3β against proteolysis was assessed via DARTS (left). The relative
  quantification of the target protein level was analyzed via ImageJ (right). Mean
  values ± SDs are shown (n = 3). Significance was assessed via two-tailed, unpaired
  Student’s t tests. ns, not significant; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.
