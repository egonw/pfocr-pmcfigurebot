caption: Gene expression profiles for the caffeine biosynthetic pathway. Expression
  profiles for caffeine biosynthetic genes in C. arabica, C. canephora, and C. eugenioides
  (A), as well as allele-specific expression of Ca and Ea homeologue pairs in C. arabica
  (B). The x-axis represents seed developmental stages in chronological order and
  the y-axis represents the gene expression level as normalized read counts. DXMT1
  (Cc01g00720), 3,7-dimethylxanthine methyltransferase (caffeine synthase); GSDA (Cc02g31500),
  guanosine deaminase; MXMT1 (Cc00g24720), 7-methylxanthine methyltransferase (theobromine
  synthase); NMN, N-methylnucleosidase; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine;
  XMT1 (Cc09g06970), xanthosine methyltransferase.
