caption: 'Other signaling pathways in pyroptosis. Most members of the GSDM family
  play an important role in the pyroptotic signaling pathways. GSDMD can be cleaved
  by NE, cathepsin G, and caspase-8, which is activated by Yersinia via the TLR4/RIP1
  signaling pathway to induce pyroptosis. GSDMB is cleaved by caspase-1/3/6/7 and
  granzyme A to trigger pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the full length of GSDMB enhances caspase-4
  cleaving GSDMD to undergo pyroptosis. The cleavage of GSDMC is executed by caspase-8
  to induce pyroptosis. GSDME is cleaved to induce pyroptosis with chemotherapy drugs
  that initiate caspase-3. Additionally, GSDME can be processed by granzyme B to initiate
  pyroptosis. Moreover, the caspase-8/GSDMC and caspase-3/GSDME signaling pathways
  can switch apoptosis to pyroptosis. Note: GSDMD, gasdermin D; NE, neutrophil elastase;
  RIP1, receptor interacting protein 1; GSDMB, gasdermin B; GSDMA, gasdermin A; GSDMC,
  gasdermin C; GSDME, gasdermin E'
