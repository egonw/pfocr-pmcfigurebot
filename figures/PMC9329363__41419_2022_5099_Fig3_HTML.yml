figure_title: ARHGEF2 was highly expressed in HCC and was associated with poor prognosis
caption: 'A Expression profile of ARHGEF2 mRNA in HCC tissues and normal tissues (TCGA).
  B ARHGEF2 expression in the different clinical stages (TCGA). C ARHGEF2 expression
  in different histological grades gruops (TCGA). D ARHGEF2 expression in different
  clinical status (TCGA). E Sankey diagram were made according to TNM stage, histological
  grade, status and ARHGEF2 expression from the TCGA dataset (https://portal.gdc.com).
  Each row represents a feature variable, different color represents different typing
  or stage, lines repersent the distribution of the same sample in different feature
  variables. F ROC curve was constructed based on the TCGA databases. G IHC staining
  were divided into four grades according to the staining intensity: 0, 1, 2 and 3.
  H IHC staining of ARHGEF2 in liver cancer and adjacent tissue. I, J IHC staining
  of ARHGEF2 in the different clinical stages (I) and histological grade (J). K Kaplan-Meier
  analysis of overall survival stratified by low ARHGEF2 expression (n = 21) and high
  ARHGEF2 expression (n = 28). L ARHGEF2 protein expression in 8 paired liver cancer
  and adjacent tissues was detected by Western Blot. M qRT-PCR was used to detect
  the mRNA expression of ARHGEF2 in liver cancer and adjacent tissues.'
