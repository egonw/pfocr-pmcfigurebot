caption: 'Increases in adenylyl cyclase activator-induced intracellular cAMP level,
  and effect of phosphodiesterase and adenylyl cyclase inhibitors on these increases
  in TG neurons. (A,C) Representative traces of FSK-induced transient increases in
  intracellular cAMP level in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Black boxes denote
  time periods of 1 μM FSK addition to the external solution. White boxes indicate
  the time of addition of IBMX (A) or SQ22536 (C) to the external solution. (B,D)
  Summary bar graphs of FSK-evoked increases in intracellular cAMP level, with (middle
  column) or without (upper column) 50 µM IBMX (B) or 0.1 µM SQ22536 (D), in the presence
  of extracellular Ca2+. Each recovery (lower column) indicates that the effects of
  IBMX (B) and SQ22536 (D) are reversible. (E,G) Representative traces of FSK-, IBMX-,
  or SQ22536-induced transient increases in intracellular cAMP level in the presence
  of extracellular Ca2+. Black boxes denote time periods of 1 μM FSK addition to the
  external solution. White boxes indicate the time of addition of IBMX (E) or SQ22536
  (G) to the external solution. (F,H) Summary bar graphs of FSK- (upper columns in
  (F,H), IBMX- (middle column in (F)), or SQ22536- (middle column in (H)) induced
  intracellular cAMP level increase in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Each bar
  shows mean ± standard error (S.E.) of five (B), eight (D), eight (F), and six (H)
  experiments. Asterisk: * p < 0.05 indicates statistically significant differences
  between columns (indicated by a solid line). N.S. represents that there is no significance
  between columns.'
