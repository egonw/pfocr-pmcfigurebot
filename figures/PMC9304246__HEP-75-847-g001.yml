caption: 'PXN‐AS1‐IR3 enhances MYC signaling in HCC. (A) RNA‐seq was subjected to
  screen the downstream genes regulated by PXN‐AS1‐IR3, and the differential expression
  genes were analyzed by gene‐set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The top 10 most‐enriched
  gene sets are shown. (B) GSEA plots of “MYC target” pathway‐related signatures in
  PXN‐AS1‐IR3‐depleted cells versus control cells. (C) PXN‐AS1‐IR3‐regulated genes
  involved in the MYC signaling pathway were confirmed by Real time PCR. *p < 0.05.
  (D) Enrichment of PXN‐AS1‐IR3 on MYC was detected by RIP assay (top). Western blot
  was performed to confirm that MYC was immunoprecipitated in the RIP experiments
  (bottom). (E) Specific associations of MYC protein with PXN‐AS1‐IR3, but not PXN‐AS1‐WT,
  were detected by RNA pulldown assay. (F) Schematic of truncated PXN‐AS1‐IR3 (top).
  The full‐length PXN‐AS1‐IR3 (#1) and truncated PXN‐AS1‐IR3 (#2, 1‐150 nt; #3, 1‐273
  nt; #4, 1‐425 nt; #5, 1‐624 nt; #6, 625‐858 nt; #7, 426‐858 nt; #8, 274‐858 nt;
  #9, 426‐858 nt) were confirmed by PCR (middle). The binding of MYC protein with
  truncated PXN‐AS1‐IR3 was detected by RNA pulldown assay (bottom). (G) Effect of
  PXN‐AS1‐IR3 knockdown on MYC mRNA and protein level was examined by Real time PCR
  and western blot, respectively. *p < 0.05. (H) Effect of MYC on healing velocity
  in PXN‐AS1‐IR3 knockdown cells was determined by wound healing assay. The distance
  was measured from six images. (I) Effect of MYC on HCC migration and invasion in
  PXN‐AS1‐IR3 knockdown cells was determined by transwell assay. *p < 0.05. IB, immunoblot;
  NES, normalized enrichment score'
