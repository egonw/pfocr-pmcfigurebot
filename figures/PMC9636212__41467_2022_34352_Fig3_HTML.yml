figure_title: Targeted activation of the MYD88 pathway in osteocytes and mature osteoblasts
  is sufficient to trigger calvarial osteolysis and alveolar bone loss
caption: 'a Top: MicroCT images of the calvaria. Representative images from each group
  of male mice injected with Pam3CSK4 (n ≥ 6/group). Bottom: Erosion area (n = 7,
  10, 3, 8, 8, 6), BS/BV (n = 7, 9, 3, 8, 8, 6), and BV/TV (n = 7, 9, 3, 8, 8, 6)
  of the calvaria. b Top: MicroCT images of the right maxilla. Representative images
  from each group of male mice inoculated with Pg (n ≥ 3/group). Buccal side view.
  Bottom: The total CEJ-ABC distance of the right maxillary molars and alveolar BV/TV
  underneath the second molar of the right maxilla. n = 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5. c Top: TRAP
  staining of the calvarial bone. Representative images from each group of male mice
  injected with Pam3CSK4 (n ≥ 5/group). Scale bar = 100 μm. Bottom left: Histomorphometric
  analysis of osteoclasts on the calvarial bone surface. n = 5, 7, 3, 7, 5, 6. Bottom
  right: qPCR analysis of Rankl in calvarial bone tissue. n = 5, 7, 6, 8, 7, 7. d
  Top: TRAP staining of the alveolar bone. Representative images from each group of
  male mice inoculated with Pg (n ≥ 3/group). Scale bar = 100 μm. Bottom left: Histomorphometric
  analysis of osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface. n = 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5. Bottom
  right: qPCR analysis of Rankl in alveolar bone tissue. n = 4, 5, 6, 4, 3, 5. e H&E
  staining of skin tissue on the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures.
  Representative images from each group of male mice injected with Pam3CSK4 (n ≥ 3/group).
  Scale bar = 100 μm. f qPCR analysis of inflammatory cytokines in skin tissue on
  the calvaria and gingival tissue. Skin Tnf and Il1b (n = 5, 3, 3, 9, 3, 4). Skin
  Il6 (n = 4, 3, 3, 9, 3, 4). Gingival Tnf, Il1b, and Il6 (n = 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3).
  g Left: Immunohistochemical staining of neutrophils and macrophages in skin tissue
  on the calvaria. Representative images from three independent experiments with similar
  results. Scale bar = 100 μm. Right: qPCR analysis of macrophage and neutrophil marker
  genes in skin tissue on the calvaria. Ly6g (n = 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 4). Adgre1 (n = 5,
  3, 3, 8, 3, 4). a–g Data from male mice. Female mice showed the similar results.
  Pam3 = Pam3CSK4. Pg = Porphyromonas gingivalis. a–d, f, g Data are presented as
  mean ± SD. *p < 0.05 with one-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer test. #p < 0.05 when two-tailed
  unpaired t-test was used (f, g). ns = not significant with ANOVA. Each data point
  represents a biologically independent mouse. Source data are provided as a Source
