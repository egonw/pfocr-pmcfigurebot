caption: 'Differential gene expression and changes of receptor-ligand interactions
  after treatments. (A) Venn diagrams show the number of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) that were upregulated in the treated samples compared with no treatment
  control. The number of common DEGs upregulated in multiple samples are shown in
  the overlapped areas. Left: CD8 T cells. Right: macrophage. (B) Heatmap showing
  cell-cell scaled communication probability as computed by CellChat across all treatments.
  Rows show signaling pathways and columns indicate average communication probability
  (using law of mass action by CellChat). We focus on a few signaling pathways (as
  shown in the solid box) for which we show heatmaps of incoming (CD8+T cells to macrophages)
  and outgoing (macrophages to CD8+T cells) for individual cell types. This heatmap
  is displaying differential number of interactions and their strength in the cell-cell
  communication network between control and HS201-PDT and aPD-L1 antibody combination
  treatment. We focus on CXCL signaling pathway because of alternating cell-cell signaling
  strength for incoming and out coming interactions between macrophages and CD8+T
  cells. (C) Chord diagrams (or circos plots) showing ligand-receptor interactions
  between macrophages and activated CD8+T cells in control and treatment groups. Cxcr3-associated
  ligand-receptor interactions are highlighted in the circos plot of the combination
  treatment. (D) Heatmap shows activation status of Cxcr3/Cxcr5/Cxcr6 on activated
  CD8+T cells in each treatment group. Enhanced CXCR3 receptor activation (due to
  active ligand binding from macrophages) on activated CD8+T cells is demonstrated
  in combination treatment group compared with others. Barplot in the right panel
  shows CXCR3 signature scores for each treatment group.'
