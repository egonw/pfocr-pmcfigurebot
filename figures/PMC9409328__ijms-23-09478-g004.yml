caption: Beta 2-adrenergic antagonist inhibits lipogenesis in HMGECs. HMGECs were
  cultured with or without timolol (0.0002%; timolol was treated at days 0 and 2).
  (A,B) mRNA and protein expression levels of PPARγ and SREBP-1 were assessed by quantitative
  PCR and immunoblotting on days 0, 2, and 4 (the sum of 3 and 4 experiments, respectively).
  (C,D) Lipid synthesis was measured by AdipoRed assay and LipidTOX assay at day 4,
  and the results of three experiments are summarized. Data are presented as mean
  ± standard error of the mean. D, days after differentiation; * p < 0.05; ** p <
  0.01.
