caption: Effect of BCAA on expression of key genes involved in central carbon metabolism
  and acetyl-CoA content of S. bambusicola S8. A Acetyl-CoA content in S. bambusicola
  S8. B Central metabolic pathway metabolic network diagram containing the glycolysis
  (EMP), tricaboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. Some of steps and
  compounds are omitted for simplification. C The expression of key genes involved
  in central carbon metabolism. l-Val or l-Leu was added at 1.5 g/L on day 2. HK Hexokinase,
  PFK 6-phosphofructokinase, PK pyruvate kinase, ACL ATP citrate (pro-S)-lyase, CS
  citrate synthase, FAS1 fatty acid synthase subunit beta and FAS2 subunit alpha.
  The culture without l-Val and l-Leu in the production medium with Triton X-100 was
  used as control. The cultural conditions of S. bambusicola S8 was 150 rpm and 28 °C.
  Values are mean ± SD from three independent experiments (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 versus
  control group)
