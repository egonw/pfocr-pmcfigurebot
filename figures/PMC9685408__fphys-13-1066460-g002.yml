caption: 'Epigenetic regulation in lymphangiogenesis. Epigenetic regulation regarding
  lymphatic development is mediated in LECs as follows: 1) Chd4 is functionally associated
  with the Hippo signaling pathway and downregulates Prox1 expression together with
  Hippo pathway final effectors YAP/TAZ; 2) Dot1l promotes transcription by histone
  methylation of chromatin; 3) Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase
  p300 that interacts with Prox1 to acetylate histones. ETS 1/2 participates in VEGFR3
  gene expression by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase p300 to the VEGFR3 locus
  and leading to histone acetylation. LEC, lymphatic endothelial cell.'
