figure_title: NOTCH pathway is the target signaling for MCs expressional and functional
  changes after disc injury
caption: a Schematic of the TMJ disc injury mouse model and integrated single-cell
  transcriptomic analyses using both normal and injured disc cells. b Dimension reduction
  presentation (via UMAP) of integrated single-cell transcriptome data for all disc
  samples. Each dot represents a single cell and is labeled by different color depths
  according to stage and injury condition. c Dimension reduction presentation (via
  UMAP) of integrated single-cell transcriptome data for normal disc cells (in grey)
  and injured disc cells (in red). Each dot represents a single cell, the retained
  cell number is 46827. d Proportion of inferred signaling interaction numbers in
  normal and injured TMJ disc cells. e Proportion of signaling interaction strength
  in normal and injured TMJ disc cells. f UMAP plot of MC subpopulations according
  to the Methods. Each dot represents a single cell and is labeled by different color
  depths according to stage and injury condition. g Stacked bar graph of outgoing
  and incoming information flow for each signaling pathway associated with mural cells
  of 3d and injury TMJ disc datasets. h Stacked bar graph of outgoing and incoming
  information flow for each signaling pathway associated with mural cells of 3w and
  injury TMJ disc datasets. i Stacked bar graph of outgoing and incoming information
  flow for each signaling pathway associated with mural cells of 16w and injury TMJ
  disc datasets. j Stacked bar graph of outgoing and incoming information flow for
  each signaling pathway associated with mural cells of 78w and injury TMJ disc datasets.
