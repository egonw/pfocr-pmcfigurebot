  Stage I (Initiation), with early induction of predominant chemokines upon SARS-CoV-2
  infection and viral sepsis'
caption: 'Treatment at this stage with CVC (highlighted in blue text and arrows) is
  postulated to maintain normalized myeloid compartmentalization at early stage of
  infection, or block aberrant myeloid infiltration upon CCL2, 3, and 5 signaling
  following SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequent cytokine amplification (Stage II),
  and subsequent tissue damage and eventual death (Stage IIIâ€”consummation). Lu L,
