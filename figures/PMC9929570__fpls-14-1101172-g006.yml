caption: Impacts of increased different UV-B exposure on Structural Genes of Anthocyanin
  Synthesis Pathway in Tuber (CK, T1, and T2 were treated with different UV-B treatments,
  and 48, 60, 72 and 84 were the different growth stages of “Huaxinyangyu” and “Jianchuanhong”).
  PAL, phenylalnine ammonialyase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3’5’H, flavanone 3′,5′-hydroxylase; F3’H, flavanone
  3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanin synthetase; UFGT,
  UDP glucose-flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase. According to the Duncan test, different
  letters indicate a significant difference (p< 0.05) among the treatments. The error
  bars represent the mean ± SE.).
