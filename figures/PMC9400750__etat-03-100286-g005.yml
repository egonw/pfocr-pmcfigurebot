caption: RANK pathway contributes to ET resistance. RANK activation by RANKL activates
  a signaling cascade that involves several downstream pathways, such as NFκB, AKT,
  ERK, and MAPK. RANK OE breast tumors are more aggressive, presenting a staminal
  and mesenchymal phenotype, with increased invasion and metastatic ability. RANKL-RANK
  pathway activation induces ET resistance through NFκB activation and/or other mechanisms
  yet to be clarified. Inhibition of RANK pathway signaling, either by blocking RANKL,
  inhibiting downstream mediators like NFκB, or using senolytic drugs to overcome
  RANK-induced senescence, may contribute to avoiding or circumventing ET resistance
