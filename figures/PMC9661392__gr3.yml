  cells in vitro (A) Effects of TMEM100 overexpression on migration by wounding healing
  assays in DU145 and PC3 cells. (B) Effects of TMEM100 overexpression on invasion
  by transwell assays in DU145 and PC3 cells. (C) Changes in the EMT-related proteins
  were detected by Western blot in DU145 and PC3 cells. (D-E) Representative fluorescence
