caption: Atorvastatin induces an MVA pathway-dependent slowdown of the S-phase of
  cell cycle and apoptosis. (A) Analysis of cell cycle by EdU staining in A673 (n
  = 3 biological replicates), TC71 (n = 2 biological replicates), and POE (n = 3 biological
  replicates) Ewing cells with X2 IC50 doses of Atorvastatin for 72 h. (B) Atorvastatin
  induces a decrease in EdU incorporation during the S-phase. The graph represents
  specific MFI of EdU-labeled cells relative to DMSO for each cell line (n > 3 biological
  replicates). (C,D) Analysis of cell-cycle progression by EdU pulse–chase method
  in the A673 (n = 3 biological replicates) (C) and TC71 (n = 1) (D) cell lines treated,
  respectively, with 1 µM and 5 µM Ato for 72 h (80% of proliferation inhibition).
  Cells were collected 2, 4, 6, 8 h, and 10 h after EdU pulse. The histograms represent
  the EdU-labeled cells relative to T0 (start point after EdU pulse) during the S-phase
  and early S-phase. (E) Analysis of p21 expression in the A673 cell line treated
  with 0.5 µM Atorvastatin for 72 h and with rescue by MEV (100 µM). (F) Study of
  apoptosis by Annexin-V-staining assay and by assessing the presence of cleaved caspase-3
  and cleaved-PARP by Western blot in 3 Ewing cell lines (A673, TC71, and POE) treated
  for 72 h with 0.5 µM (IC50), 2.6 µM (IC50 × 2) and 2.4 µM (IC50 × 2) Atorvastatin,
  respectively (n > 5 biological replicates). (G) Measurement of cell viability 72
  h after Atorvastatin treatment at 2 × IC50 (A673, 1 µM; TC71, 2.6 µM; POE, 2.4 µM)
  with rescue by Mevalonic acid (MEV) (100 µM), Farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp) (10 µM),
  or GeranylGeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGpp) (10 µM) metabolites (n = 3 biological replicates).
  Data are presented as mean +/− SEM (A,B,F) or +/− SD (C,G). **** p value < 0.0001,
  *** p value < 0.001, ** p value < 0.01, * p value < 0.05 versus DMSO (A,B,F,G) or
  versus Ato treatment (G), unpaired Student’s t-test. (H) Atorvastatin induces a
  decreased EdU incorporation during the S-phase with rescue by MEV (100 µM) in the
  A673 cell line. The barplot represents the EdU-labeled cells relative to T0 (start
  point after EdU pulse) during the S-phase 4, 6, 8, and 10 h post EdU pulse (n =
  1).
