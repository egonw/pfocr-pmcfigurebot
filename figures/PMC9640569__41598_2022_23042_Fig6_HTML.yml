caption: Mechanism of NTCI action in AD through targeted inhibition of importins α5
  and β1 comprising the nuclear transport checkpoint. Proinflammatory Stress-Responsive
  Transcription Factors, which are activated by allergic, autoimmune, and microbial
  inducers of inflammation are ferried to the cell’s nucleus through an Importin α5-mediated
  pathway. Metabolic Transcription Factors, which are activated by overfeeding or
  inborn errors of metabolism are shuttled to the nucleus by Importin β1. NTCI stops
  binding of Transcription Factors to Importin α5 and Importin β1 thereby preventing
  the activation of the genes encoding mediators of Atopic Dermatitis as well as genes
  encoding metabolic intermediates. The latter underlie the link between AD and Metabolic
  Syndrome (see text and Suppl. Fig.  for expanded view of proinflammatory signaling
  to the nucleus comparing NTCI action with currently used drugs in AD). NPC, Nuclear
  Pore Complex.
