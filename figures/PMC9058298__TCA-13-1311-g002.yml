caption: GO functional term and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analyses showed
  that hnRNPK knockdown activated the p53‐dependent signaling pathway. (a) GO annotation
  of downregulated mRNAs with the top 10 enrichment scores in the categories of molecular
  functions, cellular components and biological process. (b) KEGG signaling pathway
  enrichment analysis of downregulated mRNAs with the top 30 enrichment scores. (c–d)
  Western blotting detected the protein expression of associated signaling pathway
  after DNA damage and hnRNPK knockdown in A549 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
article_title: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K promotes the progression
  of lung cancer by inhibiting the p53‐dependent signaling pathway.
