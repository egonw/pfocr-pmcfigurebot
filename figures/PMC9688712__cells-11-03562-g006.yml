caption: 'Dual roles of the honokiol microemulsion in oxidation-reduction in PC12
  cells. (A) Cell growth curves of PC12 cells at different inoculation concentrations.
  (B) Effects of honokiol microemulsion on the viability of PC12 cells. (C) Effect
  of different toxic doses of honokiol microemulsion on the activity of PC12 cells.
  (D) Activity of SOD in PC12 cells exposed to different toxic doses of the honokiol
  microemulsion. (E) Effects of H2O2 on the viability of PC12 cells. Protective effects
  of the honokiol microemulsion on the cell viability (F) and SOD activity of PC12
  cells injured by H2O2 (G). The data are expressed as the mean ± SD (** p < 0.01
  compared with the control group; ## p < 0.01 compared with the H2O2 model group).'
