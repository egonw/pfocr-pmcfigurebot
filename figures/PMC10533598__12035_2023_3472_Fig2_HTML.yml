caption: Depiction of the proposed interactions of HERV-K, TDP-43 and inflammatory
  mediators in the process of neurodegeneration in ALS. A Astrocytes and Microglia
  release pro-inflammatory cytokines that can induce TDP-43 cytoplasmic mislocalisation
  in neurons. B Mislocalisation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm de-represses HERV-K transcription
  which leads to the production of HERV-K RNA. The HERV-K mRNA is translated into
  HERV-K proteins including Gag, envelope (env) and the reverse transcriptase enzyme
  (RT) from the pol gene. The RT enzyme acts to reverse transcribe the HERV-K into
  double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Cytoplasmic dsDNA is a danger signal that is recognised
  by and activates the cGAS/STING pathway that subsequently activates TBK1 resulting
  in phosphorylation of IRF3, IRF7 and release of NF-κB from the cytoplasm. These
  transcription factors move to the nucleus and subsequently induce transcription
  of mRNA for multiple inflammatory factors and interferons. Additionally, NF-κB can
  further drive HERV-K transcription. C Triumeq contains two RT inhibitors which could
  act on inhibiting the reverse transcription of HERV-K RNA into dsDNA to prevent
  the activation of cGAS/STING pathway. D This would be predicted to reduce the release
  of inflammatory mediators and prevent the spread of toxicity between neurons. IRF3/7,
  interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; TNF-α, tumour necrosis factor alpha; TGF-β1, transforming
  growth factor β1; NO, nitric oxide; P, phosphorylation; TBK1, tank binding kinase
  1; IL-6, interleukin 6; T, Triumeq. Image made in BioRender
