caption: The antitumor efficacy of co-treatment with PD and CTX in subcutaneous tumor
  models. (A) Subcutaneous tumor models of HCT116 and LoVo cells were collected after
  the mice were sacrificed. Each group contained five mice, but one mouse of the HCT116
  control group died during the experiment. (B) After sacrifice, subcutaneous tumors
  were removed and photographed. (C) Tumor weight was measured using an electronic
  balance. The mean ± S.D. is shown. One-way ANOVA was performed used to analyze P
  values between groups. All groups are compared with the ‘control’ group, the ‘CTX’
  group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’ group. *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
  (D) Survival curves of each group. Survival days of other groups are compared with
  those of the control group; the ‘CTX’ group is compared with the ‘CTX+PD’ group.
  *P<0.05 represents a significant difference.
