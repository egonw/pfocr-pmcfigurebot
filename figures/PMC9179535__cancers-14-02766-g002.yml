caption: 'Ponatinib inhibits the glycolysis pathway in multiple-myeloma cells. (A)
  Glucose metabolism array was performed on RPMI8226 cells, using Bioneer gene-expression
  array plates. Cells were exposed to ponatinib (1 μM) for 12 h, and total mRNA was
  extracted. The gene expression was analyzed by using qPCR. The histogram represents
  the ‘% changes’ in gene expression for different glucose metabolism pathways. (B,C)
  Ponatinib and vehicle control, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), treatment were for 12 h.
  (B) Glycolytic gene-expression changes were quantified by using qPCR. (C) HK2 and
  GPI activity and pyruvate and lactate production were examined by using specific
  assay kits. Data are presented as mean ± SEM; t-test: * p < 0.05.'
