figure_title: cGAS-STING activation in dying tumor cells and APCs. STING activation
  in antigen presenting cells (APC) occurs upon phagocytosis of tumor cells
caption: In the phagosome, MHC loading occurs and there is subsequent activation of
  T cells through T-cell Receptor (TCR) signaling. Degradation of tumor cells leads
  to the accumulation of cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). dsDNA activates
  cGAS triggering the conversion of ATP and GTP into cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second
  messenger. cGAMP activates STING which translocates to nuclear compartment triggering
  transcription of interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) and production of type I IFNs
  and proinflammatory cytokines through phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-kB transcription
  factors. Similarly, within tumor cells, cDNA accumulation occurs due to DNA damage
  from chromosome instability or treatment leading to cGAS-STING pathway activation.
  Production of type I IFNs triggers the membrane translocation of retinoic acid early
  transcript 1 (RAE1), a NKG2D ligand which interacts with NK Cells resulting in their
  activation. Created with BioRender.com.
