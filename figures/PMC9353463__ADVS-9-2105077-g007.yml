caption: CGE nanoparticle‐mediated TMEM44‐AS1 silencing enhances 5‐FU toxicity in
  vivo. A) In vivo imaging of xenograft‐bearing mice after intratumoral injection
  of PBS,CGE,FAM‐si‐TMEM44‐AS1 only, or CGE/FAM‐si‐TMEM44‐AS1 (n = 3). B) In vivo
  imaging of xenograft‐bearing mice after tail vein injection of PBS, CGE, free FAM‐siTMEM44‐AS1,
  or CGE/FAM‐siTMEM44‐AS1 (n = 3). C) Sketch map showing tumor inoculation as well
  as diverse treatment of nude mice bearing tumor. D) Images of the collected subcutaneous
  xenograft tumors. E) Tumor volume in xenograft‐bearing nude mice was recorded weekly.
  F) Eventual weights of subcutaneous xenograft tumors. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. G) Schematic diagram of the mechanism underlying
  the role of CGE / si‐TMEM44‐AS1 complexes in increasing the sensitivity of gastric
  cancer cells to 5‐FU.
