caption: The impact of light on the expression of Cdr1as and associated genes. Evidence
  plots show enrichment of SCN immediate light-induced genes (defined in Xu et al.
  []) in the (A) cortex and (B) olfactory bulb of Cdr1as KO mice. The X-axis shows
  the list of sorted genes (by adj. p-value Cdr1as KO vs. WT) from polyA RNA-Seq in
  Piwecka et al. []. Y-axis is the fraction of the gene set defined by Xu et al.,
  2021 []. In red are genes upregulated in Cdr1as KO with adj. p-value < 0.05. (C)
  Log2 expression (normalized to the temporal mean) of the top 50 genes (sorted by
  FPKM) from the twin-peak module in the LD cycle []. (D) The same set of genes (as
  in C) in the DD cycle. Cheng et al. [] measured RNA expression in control and Sox2
  mutant mice in the DD cycle at four different time points. Here, we used only control
  samples. (E) Cdr1as and miR-7 are both expressed in the SCN. Predicted targets of
  miR-7 were downloaded from Targetscan []. Twin-peak genes are defined in Pembroke
  et al. []. The immediate light-induced gene module is from Xu et al. []. The annotation
  of other pathway modules is from the MsigDB database.
