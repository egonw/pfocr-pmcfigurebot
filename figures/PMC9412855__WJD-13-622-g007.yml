caption: 'Target-pathway diagram of Ruyi Jinhuang powder-diabetic foot ulcer. A: A
  bar graph of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway enrichment.
  The left side is the pathway name, and the right side is the number of targets contained;
  B: The target-path network relationship diagram. The yellow circle represents 27
  pathways, and the blue square represents 36 targets; C: An enriched bubble diagram
  of the KEGG signaling pathway. The left side is the pathway name, and the abscissa
  is the fold enrichment. The bubble size corresponds to the number of targets contained,
  and the color category corresponds to the P value; D: The correspondence diagram
  of pathway categories. The first column is the ownership of the pathway, the second
  column is the pathway, and the third column is the target.'
