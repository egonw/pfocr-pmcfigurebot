caption: ERS-mediated stagnation of crystallin synthesis plays a critical role during
  the accelerated development of congenital cataract. (A) Real-time PCR analysis of
  the expression of crystalline-coding genes such as Cryaa, Cryab, Cryba1, Cryba4,
  Crybb1, Crybb2, Crygb, Crygc, and Crygd in the lenses of WT, W151C +/−, and W151C
  +/+ mice at 3, 6, and 9 months of age. The experiments were repeated independently
  three or more times. (B) Western blot analysis of α-, β-, and γ-crystallin protein
  levels in the lenses of WT, W151C +/-, and W151C +/+ mice at 3 months of age. The
  experiments were repeated independently three or more times.
