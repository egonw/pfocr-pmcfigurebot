caption: Significant biofunctions identified by Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). Out of the total 55 bio functions identified to be significantly inhibited
  by IPA (A), inflammatory response was within the top 10 biofunctions identified
  as indicated by double, red-colored asterisks. Immune cell recruitment and chemotactic
  functions related to neutrophils, macrophages, and T-cells were predicted to be
  decreased as well as indicated by red-colored triangles (A). Genes from the NanoString
  dataset in the HD group which contribute towards decreased inflammatory responses
  are depicted in panel (B). The level of significance was set as p-value of overlap < 0.05,
  with z-score < − 2 or z-score > 2.
