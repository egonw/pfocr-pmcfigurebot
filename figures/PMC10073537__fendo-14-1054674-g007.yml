caption: The structures and compositions of the gut microbiota before and after treatment
  in the two groups. (A) The Venn diagram of OTUs (species). (B) The composition of
  relative abundance on genus. (C) Phylogenetic cladogram of microbial lineage in
  fecal samples of treatment group and placebo group, with colors representing the
  most abundant differences in composition. (D) Key phylotypes of the gut microbiota
  responding to W-LHIT treatment. The histogram shows the lineage with LDA value of
  4 or higher determined by LEFSe. (E) Key KEGG metabolic pathway responding to W-LHIT
  treatment.
