caption: Response to ER-stress in mammalian cells and trypanosomatids. In mammalian
  cells, the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, induced by various intrinsic
  and extrinsic stimulus, causes ER stress. Under stress, BiP/GRP78 dissociates from
  the ER transmembrane stress sensors (IRE1, PERK and ATF6) and activates a signaling
  cascade to re-establish the ER functions and promote cell survival through the transcription
  of genes related to autophagy, chaperones, lipid biosynthesis, ERAD, etc. However,
  failure of this adaptative UPR response may activate programmed cell death (PCD).
  Trypanosomatids lack a canonical UPR response. IRE1 and ATF6 are absent in these
  parasites. A PERK homologue was found in Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi. In Leishmania
  spp., ER-stressors activate PERK, which in turn phosphorylates eIF2α. The phosphorylation
  of eIF2α leads to attenuation of translation and a decrease in the load of proteins
  into the ER. In Trypanosoma brucei, PK3, a serine threonine kinase, plays a key
  role in sensing and transmitting the ER-stress signal from ER to the nucleus, where
  it activates the Splice Leader Silencing (SLS) pathway. PK3 phosphorylates TRF4,
  causing its release from its cognate promoter. The hallmarks of SLS are the shut-off
  in SL RNA due to impairment of tSNAP42’s ability to bind the SL RNA promoter, leading
  to its accumulation in the nucleus. Under mild ER-stress, some mRNAs are stabilized.
  When the ER-stress is persistent, the PK3-TRAF4-SLS cascade leads to the cell death. This
