caption: Two major pathways of coagulation converge during hemostasis to form a blood
  clot. The original “waterfall” model of the coagulation cascade comprises the intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways which converge into a common pathway to generate thrombin
  and form a fibrin clot. The intrinsic pathway primarily contributes to pathological
  clot formation and is activated when FXII encounters blood‐borne, negatively charged
  surfaces such as RNA, DNA, and components of atherosclerotic plaques. The extrinsic
  pathway is activated when subvascular TF is exposed to plasma, or released into
  the bloodstream via innate immune cell pyroptosis, where TF forms a cell‐surface
  complex with FVIIa. The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways combine to activate FX,
  which drives thrombin generation and ultimately blood clot formation. Endogenous
  inhibitors of the coagulation cascade include TFPI, activated protein C, and antithrombin.
