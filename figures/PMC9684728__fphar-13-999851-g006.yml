caption: 'DIM inhibits the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (A,B)
  Effects of DIM on the protein expression levels of p-PI3K, total PI3K, p-AKT, total
  AKT, p-mTOR, and total mTOR in human chondrocytes treated as above were measured
  by western blotting and quantitation (C) After treatment, immunofluorescence staining
  showed the changes in the fluorescence intensity of p-PI3K in each group (scale
  bar, 20 µm) (D) The fluorescence intensity was measured with the ImageJ software
  (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The data are presented as mean ±
  SD values from three independent experiments. Using one-way ANOVA, NS, no statistical
  difference; #p <0.05 vs. the control; # #p <0.01 vs. the control; * p < 0.05 vs.
  the LPS group; ** p < 0.01 vs. the LPS group.'
