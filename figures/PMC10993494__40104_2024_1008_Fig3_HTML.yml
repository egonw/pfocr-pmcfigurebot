caption: Biological pathways predicted as regulated by miRNAs up-regulated in OF-EVs
  and UF-EVs. A Pathways predicted as regulated by miRNA (bta-miR-148b) up-regulated
  in OF-EVs. B Pathways predicted as regulated by miRNAs (bta-miR-134, bta-miR-151-3p,
  bta-miR-155, bta-miR-188, bta-miR-181b, bta-miR-181d, bta-miR-224, bta-miR-23b-3p,
  bta-miR-24-3p, bta-miR-27a-3p, bta-miR-29a, bta-miR-324, bta-miR-326, bta-miR-345-3p,
  bta-miR-410, bta-miR-652, bta-miR-677, bta-miR-873 and bta-miR-708) up-regulated
  in UF-EVs. The left Y-axis values represent the percentage of genes predicted as
  modulated by the miRNAs for the respective pathways (number of genes predicted to
  be modulated by miRNAs in each group divided by the total number of genes of each
  pathway). The right Y-axis represents the enrichment score (P-value) for each interaction.
  Blue squares highlight functions with potential relevance for embryo development.
  Pathways were accessed through miRWalk 3.0 database
