caption: Identification of the CDC23 interaction relationships. (A) Circos plots of
  MEG3 and its 44 potential interaction proteins. (B,C) The protein–protein interactions
  between potential interacting proteins of MEG3 and core-enriched genes in the cell
  cycle pathway were retrieved using the STRING database. (D) Western blotting results
  showed that MEG3 specifically binds to the CDC23 protein. (E) RNA immunoprecipitation
  (RIP) results indicated that the CDC23 protein binds to MEG3. The PKNOX2 protein
  and lnc-TCONS_00323213 were used as the negative control. (F) RIP-RT-qPCR results
  indicated that MEG3 was significantly enriched by the CDC23 protein. (G) The interaction
  of truncated MEG3 and CDC23 was determined via RNA pull-down. Error bars are the
  mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of three biological replicates. Statistical
  differences between groups were determined with a 2-tailed Student’s t-test, and
  a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (** p < 0.01). ns is considered
  to be not significant.
