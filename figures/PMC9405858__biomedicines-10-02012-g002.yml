caption: Off-target PHA-767491 activity inhibits E2F-mediated transcription of the
  cell cycle regulators cyclin E1, cyclin E2, Dbf4 and cyclin A2. (A) Immunoblot showing
  the levels of total MCM2, pS53-MCM2 and pS40/41-MCM2 as DDK-specific phospho-sites,
  cyclin E, cyclin A, Dbf4, RB, RB pS811 as CDK2 phospho-site and actin after DDK
  inhibitor treatment as indicated. (B) Quantitation of RB pS811 relative to RB total
  showing mean± standard deviation, n = 3, p < 0.05 (*) was determined using unpaired
  2 tailed t-test. (C) As for A, including CDK2 inhibitors roscovitine and CVT-313.
  (D) NIH3T3 cells were synchronised in G0 and stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle.
  RNA samples were removed at indicated time points and transcript levels were determined
  by qRT-PCR. Values shown are standardised relative to maximum levels for each gene,
  showing mean ± standard deviation, n = 3. (E) Synchronous population was treated
  with DDK inhibitors 12–20 h after release from G0. The transcript levels of cyclin
  A2, cyclin E1, cyclin E2 and Dbf4 were monitored relative to GAPDH mRNA levels relative
  to the levels of the solvent control (DMSO) for PHA-767491 and XL-413 treated cells.
  Showing mean ± standard deviation, where n = 3. (F) 3T3 cells were synchronised
  and siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdc7 and Dbf4 was performed upon release from G0
  phase and total RNA extracted 20 h after transfection. Transcript levels for Dbf4
  and Cdc7 showing mean value ± standard deviation, which are the average of four
  independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. (G) Quantitation of E2F-regulated
  transcripts cyclin A2, cyclin E1 and cyclin E2 after CDC7-Dbf4 siRNA treatment from
  F, showing mean ± standard deviation, n = 3 independent experiments of with three
  technical replicates. (H) Immunoblot of WCE and chromatin fractions of siRNA transfected
  cells showing Cdc7, Dbf4, MCM2 and MCM2-pSer40/41, MCM2-pSer53, cyclin E, cyclin
  A, Dbf4, RB, RB-pS811 and actin.
