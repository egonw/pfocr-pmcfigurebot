caption: Inhibition of TAZ-induced increased cell migration by PTPN12 in NMuMG mammary
  cells. (A) Wound healing analysis using Incucyte Zoom. NMuMG (WPI vector) and NMuMG-TAZ
  expressing Dox-inducible PTPN12 cells in the absence or presence of Dox (TAZ-PTPN12)
  were seeded into 96-wells. After making the wounds, cell migration was monitored
  as a percentage of wound closure using Incucyte Zoom for 24 h. (B) Images from (A)
  showing wound closure at 0 h and 24 h. Scale bar, 300 Î¼m.
