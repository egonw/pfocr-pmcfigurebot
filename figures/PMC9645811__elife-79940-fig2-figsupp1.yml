figure_title: Human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC-CM) substantially limits downregulation
  of mTOR and MYC pathway in MV4-11 cells upon FLT3 inhibition
caption: MV4-11 cells were treated as indicated and harvested at different time points
  (3, 6, 10, and 15 hr) to measure mTORC1 signaling and c-MYC protein levels by Western
  blotting.
article_title: Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated
  by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation.
