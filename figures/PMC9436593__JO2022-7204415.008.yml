caption: Pathway enrichment and protein expression analysis of membrane lipid biosynthesis-related
  risk model genes in BRCA. (a, b) These show pathway enrichment analysis in BRCA
  for these membrane lipid biosynthesis-related risk model genes and their corresponding
  quantitative histograms. (câ€“n) Protein expression of membrane lipid biosynthesis-related
  risk model genes ALDH3B2, CERS2, ELOVL1, GPAA1, HACD3, PIGF, PLPP2, PRKD2, SGMS2,
  SGPP1, ST3GAL1, and VAPB in breast cancer and normal breast tissue; the picture
  data come from THPA database.
