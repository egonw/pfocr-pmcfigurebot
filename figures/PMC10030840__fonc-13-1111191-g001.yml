caption: 'Scheme describing different phases of this study in identifying and evaluating
  candidate variants in genes involved in various DNA repair pathways. The diagram
  illustrates: (A) study phase I for identifying candidate variants by applying a
  candidate gene approach of known or putative DNA repair genes (see ) on peripheral
  blood lymphocytes (PBL) DNA from familial ovarian cancer (OC) cases of French Canadians
  (FC) of Quebec by whole exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatic analyses (see );
  (B) study phase II for determining the carrier frequencies of the topprioritized
  candidate variants in FC familial and sporadic OC and BC cases, including hereditary
  breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and hereditary breast cancer (HBC) syndrome
  families, and population-matched controls by targeted genetic analyses (see ); (C)
  study phase III for identifying additional carriers in FC OC cases by targeted genetic
  analyses (see ); and (D) study phase IV for identifying candidate variants in the
  identified candidate DNA repair genes from phase I in non-FC OC cases, mainly of
  European origin, by targeted genetic analyses: (MIX, mixed ethnicity; AUS, Australian;
  and TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas) (see ). Teal ribbon signifies women with OC and
  pink ribbon signifies women with BC, and diagrams contain the provincial flag of
  Quebec, Canada denoting the geographic ascertainment of cases and controls. MAF,
  Minor allele frequency; and VAF, Variant allele frequency.'
