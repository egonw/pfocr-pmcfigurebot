caption: 'GAS inhibits ferroptosis via the Nrf2/GPx4 Pathway to improve hypoxic injury
  in HT22 cells. (A,B), levels of GPx4 and COX2 in HT22 cells treated with Nrf2 inhibitors
  (ML385) or Nrf2 agonists (Bardoxolone) were assessed with or without GAS treatment
  (100 μM) for 36 h (n = 3) (C), intracellular ROS levels were labeled with DCFH-DA
  (10 μM) and detected by flow cytometry (n = 3) (D), levels of GSH in HT22 cells
  treated with an agonist of Nrf2 (Bardoxolone) were detected with or without GAS
  treatment (100 μM) for 36 h (n = 3) (E), detection of intracellular Fe2+ changes
  using FerroOrange. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, compared to the control group; #p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01 compared to the hypoxia group; NS indicates no significance.'
