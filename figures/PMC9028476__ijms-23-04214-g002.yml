caption: 'The mechanism for lncRNA to participate in SA. There are two main ways lncRNAs
  participate in the occurrence and development of SA: (1) directly regulate the expression
  of target mRNA; (2) regulate the transcription and expression of downstream target
  mRNA by targeting miRNAs. “?” represents our hypothesis for this regulatory pathway
  according to existing research.'
