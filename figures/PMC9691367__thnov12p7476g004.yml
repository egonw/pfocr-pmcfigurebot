caption: SIAIS361034 possesses the ability to combat resistance to Smo inhibitors
  caused by Smo mutations and Gli2 amplification. (A-C) Dual-luciferase reporter analysis
  of the activity of SIAIS361034 against the Hh activity induced by ectopic expression
  of Smo D473H (A), Smo H231R (A), Smo W281C (A), Smo W535L (B), Smo L412F (B), Smo
  F460L (B), Smo WT (C) in light II cells, followed by treatment with various concentrations
  of SIAIS361034 as indicated for 36 h. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 2). (D) IC50
  values of the inhibitory effect of SIAIS361034 on the dual-luciferase activity measured
  in Figure A-C. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression dose response
  fit in Graphpad prism 8. (E) Dual-luciferase reporter analysis of the inhibitory
  effect of SIAIS361034, SIAIS361034NC, and GDC-0449 on the Hh activity initiated
  by ectopic expression of Gli2-HA in light II cells, followed by treatment with various
  concentrations of SIAIS361034, SIAIS361034NC, and GDC-0449 as indicated for 36 h.
  Data represent mean ± SD (n = 2).
