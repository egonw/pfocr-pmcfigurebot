caption: VEGFA regulates CSC to non-CSC turnover in A2780LR cells, and its expression
  along with CDK2N1A correlates with Notch3 in metastatic HGSOC tumors. (A) Bar diagram
  shows differences in VEGFA secretion by SNFT cells after various co-culture conditions.
  NIH3T3J1-A induced the greatest fold-increase of VEGFA activity (~5-fold) that gradually
  diminishes with OVCAR3, OAW42, NIH3T3J1-B, NIH3T3J1-D, and NIH3T3wt cells. (B) Increased
  side population was observed in A2780LR cells after treatment of either VEGFA peptide
  or conditioning with a co-cultured medium containing VEGFA (n = 2). (C) The fold
  change for the pluripotent genes, VEGFA and Notch3, was determined after conditioning
  the SP and NSP fractions of A2780LR cells that showed a prominent enrichment of
  stem-like property in SP cells compared to NSP along with a predominantly active
  Notch3/VEGFA axis only in SP cells. (D,E) The gene expression for CDKN1A and VEGFA
  was compared between primary and metastatic tumors from seven paired cases of HGSOC,
  wherein VEGFA showed significant increase post metastasis in five cases and a decrease
  or no change in one case each. For CDKN1A, the expression had either increased or
  decreased in three patients, each with one case having no difference in expression.
  (F,G) Across the ovary and omentum, Notch3 showed membranous-cytoplasmic expression.
  The majority of the cases had higher Notch3 IRS in metastatic tumors and no change
  or decrease in staining in one case each. Smooth muscle cells of blood vessels are
  considered an internal positive control. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001,
