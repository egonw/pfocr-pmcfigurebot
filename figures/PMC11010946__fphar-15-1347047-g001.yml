caption: 'Some of the actions of metformin in the gastrointestinal tract. (1) Effects
  on glucose uptake and absorption. On the one hand, metformin inhibits the absorption
  of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream by decreasing the expression
  of SGLT1 on the apical membrane of enterocytes, and on the other hand, metformin
  translocates GLUT2, which is located on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes,
  to the apical membrane and promotes glucose uptake from the blood into the intestinal
  lumen. (2) Increased GLP-1 secretion. Metformin promotes GLP-1 secretion from L
  cells by increasing glucose transporter protein expression, inhibiting DPP4 activation,
  regulating bile acid concentration, and mediating PEN2 protein, M3 cholinergic receptors
  and GRP receptors, after which GLP-1 binds to GLP-1 receptors on pancreatic islet
  cells and increases cAMP levels, followed by glucose regulation through inhibition
  of glucagon secretion and enhancement of insulin secretion. (3) Alteration of the
  gut microbiome. Gut microbiome is altered with metformin use. (4) Metformin transporter
  proteins. Metformin is absorbed into the interstitium mainly via OCT1, PMAT and
  SERT in the small intestine. (5) Modulation of immune response. Metformin can modulate
  intestinal immune responses by altering the composition of the gut microbiota, particularly
  through the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the downregulation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby achieving immunomodulation. In vitro experiments,
  metformin inhibited monocyte to macrophage differentiation. The upward arrows indicate
  increases, the downward arrows indicate decreases. SGLT1, sodium-glucose transporter
  1; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; GRP: gastrin-releasing peptide; GLP-1, glucagon-like
  peptide-1; DPP4, dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP-1R, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; OCT1, organic cation transporter 1; PMAT,
  plasma membrane monoamine transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa-B. Image created with BioRender.com, with permission.'
