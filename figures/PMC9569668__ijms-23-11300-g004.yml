caption: AEG-1/miR-221 regulates the apoptosis and autophagy regulatory mRNAs in the
  HCC cell lines. The apoptosis and autophagy regulatory mRNAs (OPN, Bcl-2, PTEN,
  LC3A, PI3K, and Akt) expressions were analyzed in miR-221 mimic-, miR-221 inhibitor,
  and AEG-1 siRNA-transfected HCC cells by using qRT-PCR, and GAPDH used as an internal
  control. Error bars presented as mean Â± s.d. and p-value represented as * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared with corresponding controls.
