caption: Myeloid-specific Xbp1 deficiency ameliorates experimental liver fibrosis.(A)
  The gene expression of XBP1 in human liver tissues was determined by quantitative
  RT-PCR; 1-way ANOVA. (B) The protein levels of XBP1 in human normal and fibrotic
  liver tissues were analysed using Western blot technique with respect to the loading
  control β-actin; n = 6/group; 1-way ANOVA. (C) Normal or fibrotic liver sections
  from patients were subjected to H&E and Sirius Red staining and α-SMA immunohistochemical
  analysis (n = 6/group; original magnification 200 × ; scale bar = 100 μm). (D) Dual
  immunofluorescence staining showing spliced XBP1 (red) and CD68 (green) colocalization
  in human liver tissues. (E) The ratio of sXBP1 + CD68+/CD68+ cells; n = 6/group;
  1-way ANOVA. (F) The expression levels of Xbp1 in liver tissue from mice with CCl4-,
  BDL-, and MCD-induced liver fibrosis were examined by quantitative real-time PCR;
  n = 6 mice/group; Student t test. (G) The levels of XBP1 in liver tissue from mice
  with CCl4-, BDL- and MCD-induced liver fibrosis were analysed using Western blot
  with respect to the loading control β-actin; n = 6 mice/group; Student t test. (H-J)
  Xbp1FL/FL and Xbp1M-KO male mice were subjected to CCl4-, BDL-, or MCD-induced experimental
  fibrosis, and the collected liver samples were subjected to H&E and Sirius Red staining
  and α-SMA immunohistochemical analysis. Scale bar = 100 μm. Representative of 6
  mice/group. The proportions of the Sirius Red-positive and α-SMA-positive areas
  were also quantified; n = 6 mice/group; 1-way ANOVA. The values are shown as mean
  ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using the Student t test or ANOVA. ∗∗p
  <0.01; ∗p <0.05. BDL, bile duct ligation; CCl4, carbon tetrachloride; MCD, methionine/choline
  deficient diet; α-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1.
