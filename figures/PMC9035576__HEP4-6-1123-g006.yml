caption: Chronic activation of LXRα up‐regulates pathways associated with innate immune
  suppression, but down‐regulates the bile acid metabolism pathway in chemical‐induced
  HCC. (A) Venn plot derived from RNA‐seq analysis shows the pathways up‐regulated
  in tumors from LXRαKI and VP‐LXRα transgenic mice as compared with WT mice. Eight
  commonly up‐regulated pathways are shown on the right. (B,C) GSEA for HALMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING
  (B) and HALMARK_COMPLEMENT (C) in tumors derived from LXRαKI (left panels) and VP‐LXRα
  (right panels) mice as compared with WT mice. (D,E) The tumor mRNA expression of
  representative genes in the IL‐6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (D) and complement
  pathway (E). (F) Venn plot derived from RNA‐seq analysis shows the pathways down‐regulated
  in tumors from LXRαKI and VP‐LXRα mice as compared with WT mice. Five pathways commonly
  down‐regulated are shown on the right. (G) GSEA for HALMARK_BILE_ACID_METABOLISM
  in tumors from LXRαKI (left) and VP‐LXRα (right) mice (n = 6 for each group). *P < 0.05,
  compared with WT groups in (D) and (E).
