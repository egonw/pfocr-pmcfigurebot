caption: A summary of the mechanistic actions of cobra venom cytotoxin (CTX) was created
  using BioRender.com. The basic hydrophobic loops of CTX interact with the phospholipid
  bilayer and destabilise cell membranes for cytolysis. Nevertheless, various intracellular
  cell death signalling pathways have been targeted by CTX. Cytotoxin triggers Ca2+
  influx and activation of the Ca2+/PP2A/AMPK pathway. This causes mitochondrial fragmentation.
  Furthermore, the internalised CTX following membrane permeabilisation could also
  co-localise at mitochondria to stimulate intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.
  Cytochrome c is then released following deprivation of mitochondrial membrane integrity
  and bind to APAF 1, which then recruits caspase-9 to form an apoptosome. The apoptosome
  activates the executioner caspase-3 for intrinsic apoptosis. Apoptosis is also associated
  with upregulation of proapoptotic proteins and inactivation of EFGR, Pl3K/Akt, and
  JAK/STAT3 pathways. In addition, CTX also induces extrinsic apoptosis involving
  Fas receptors. In addition, intracellular accumulation of Ca2+ activates NOX4 expression,
  a major contributor to oxidative stress which triggers p38 MAPK/cJUN/ATF-2 apoptosis
  pathways. Cell cycle arrest is a downstream cytotoxic effect of CTX. On the other
  hand, lysosomal-associated necrosis has also been reported for CTX-induced cell
  death, attributed to highly elevated cathepsin B following lysosomal membrane permeabilisation.
  Besides necrosis, CTX also induces caspase-independent, regulated necroptosis involving
  activation of TNFR1-RIPK signalling cascades, which is also associated with upregulation
  of antiapoptotic proteins such as HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and PPIA.
