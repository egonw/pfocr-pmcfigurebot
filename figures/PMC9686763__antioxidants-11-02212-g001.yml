caption: Increased cell proliferation and activated actin cytoskeleton regulator expression
  in microgravity-stimulated ARPE19 cells. (A) ARPE19 cells were grown in 25 cm2 flasks
  in the same incubator for 7 days. (B) Representative cell images show morphological
  changes following microgravity stimulation, and the changes can easily be found
  in enlarged images (bottom row). (C) The graph shows the quantified cell number
  of 1G- (white) or microgravity-stimulated ARPE19 cells (SMG, black). (D–F) Relative
  mRNA levels of (D) RHOA, (E) CDC42, and (F) RAC1 were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Means
  denoted by different letters indicate significant differences between groups (p
  < 0.05). Scale bar = 200 µm; CDC42; cell division cycle 42, NS; not significant,
  RAC1; Rac family small GTPase 1, RHOA; Ras homolog family member A, SMG; simulated
  microgravity.
