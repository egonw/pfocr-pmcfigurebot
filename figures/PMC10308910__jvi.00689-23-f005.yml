caption: PDCoV infection activates the Notch signaling pathway in intestinal monolayer
  organoids. (A) Infected and uninfected intestinal monolayer organoids were stained
  with PAS; the black arrows indicate the goblet cells. (B) MUC-2 mRNA levels from
  the intestinal monolayer organoids. (C to G) JAG-1, Dll-4, Notch-1, HES-1, and ATOH-1
  mRNA levels in uninfected and PDCoV-infected intestinal monolayer organoids. (H)
  Goblet cells (black arrows) of the intestinal monolayer organoid were stained with
  PAS. (I) MUC-2 mRNA levels from the intestinal monolayer organoid. *, P < 0.05;
  **, P < 0.01.
