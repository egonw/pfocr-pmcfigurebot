figure_title: Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the stroma surrounding
  the tumor of patients with progressive disease compared to responders
caption: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using Ward’s method shows an
  overall increase in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activity in the stroma of patients that
  developed progressive disease (a). Scatter plots with mean and standard error of
  the mean showing activation levels of key members of the signaling pathway (b–e).
