caption: Neuroendocrine aging traits and hypothalamic transcriptome expression characteristics.
  (A) (a–d) Representative pictures showing c-Fos immunoreactive cells in RP3V of
  the middle-aged (MA) and young (Y) rats on the proestrus day. (e) Quantitative analysis
  of the c-Fos+ cells in the groups (n = 4, respectively). (f) Mean luteinizing hormone
  levels were measured using trunk blood collected from the MA and Y rats (n = 7,
  respectively). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) (a) Volcano plot for differential gene
  expression analysis, (b) differentially expressed gene chart for the MA and Y rats,
  (c) GO enrichment analysis of biological processes of the differential genes, and
  (d) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. n = 3 for each group.
