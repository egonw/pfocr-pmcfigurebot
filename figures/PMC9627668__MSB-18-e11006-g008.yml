figure_title: Subtypes of TP53 mutations alter different metabolic programmes
caption: Chosen downstream targets of TP53 with their phenotypic effects. Numbers
  and percentages represent number and proportion of TP53 differently abundant metabolites
  that are also differently abundant in each downstream target.Metabolic pathway enrichment
  for metabolites shared between TP53 and each downstream gene.Lollipop plot of different
  mutations in TP53 in our dataset. Mutations are coloured by known type.Phyloplot
  showing the associations of groups of metabolites with each mutation type. Significant
  associations indicate that mutations of a specific class (conformation or DNA contact)
  are significantly associated with metabolites in respective pathway. Pathways are
  clustered by their similarity of expression across the dataset. P‚Äêvalues represent
  Fisher's exact test.
