caption: 'Inhibitory effects of the SSME on the NF-κB signaling pathway. The BV2 cells
  were treated with SSME (200 µg/mL) for 2 h, followed by stimulation with LPS (1
  µg/mL) for 15 min. (a) The expression of NF-κB/p65 and IκB was detected in the cytosolic
  and nuclear extracts using western blotting. (b) The cells were immunostained with
  anti-NF-κB/p65 (green) antibody, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The cells
  were analyzed with confocal imaging microscopy. The data presented are the mean
  ± SEM of three independent experiments. Differences between groups were analyzed
  using the Mann–Whitney U test. # p < compared with the untreated and the LPS-treated
  groups; * p < 0.05, compared with the LPS-treated and SSME- and LPS-treated groups.
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IκB, inhibitor
  of κB; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Scale bar: 10 μm.'
