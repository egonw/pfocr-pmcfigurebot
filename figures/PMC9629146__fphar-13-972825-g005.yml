caption: Licoricidin repressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of MGC-803 cells
  in vivo. (A) Expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) in
  the xenografted tumor were measured by Western blot assay and normalized by β-actin
  for quantitative analysis. Independent experiments were repeated three times. (B)
  Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the levels of proteins related to proliferation
  (Ki-67) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bax) in xenograft tumors. (C) Mean densities of
  positively expressed proteins were calculated from five random fields of view by
  Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software for quantitative analysis. Values are expressed as mean
  ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ****p < 0.0001. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil.
  Scale bar, 50 μm.
