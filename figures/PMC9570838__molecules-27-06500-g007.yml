caption: JND4135 overcomes BaF3-CD74-TRKA-G667C mutant resistance in vivo. (A) Antitumor
  efficacy of JND4135 in BaF3-CD74-TRKA-G667C xenograft mouse model. (B) Effect of
  JND4135 on body weight of BaF3-CD74-TRKA-G667C xenograft mouse model. (C) Effect
  of JND4135 on TRK signaling pathway in tumor tissues. Mice were intraperitoneally
  administrated JND4135 (20 and 40 mg/kg) once daily for 12 consecutive days. Tumors
  and body weight were measured every two days (** p <0.01).
