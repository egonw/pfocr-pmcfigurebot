caption: 'IAL treatment reduces MPP+-induced SN4741 apoptosis by activating AKT/Nrf2
  pathway. (A–C) The effect of IAL on the AKT/Nrf2 pathway in SN4741 was analyzed
  with the Western blot method. (D–F) After pretreatment of cells with MK2206 and
  RA, the effect of IAL on apoptosis-related proteins in SN4741 was analyzed with
  the Western blot method. Results are shown as means ± SEM (n = 3). #p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01, and ** p < 0.01 stand for biologically significant differences.'
