caption: 'Immune response related genes and pathways enriched in tumors treated with
  iRT are altered in the absence of TDLN. (A) Heat‐map demonstrating differently expressed
  genes in TILs isolated from primary and abscopal tumors treated with iRT in the
  presence or absence of bilateral TDLN (based on RNA‐seq data). (B) Volcano plot
  demonstrated significantly differentially expressed genes in TILs isolated from
  primary or abscopal tumors treated with iRT in the presence or absence of bilateral
  TDLN. (C) KEGG pathway analysis (based on RNA‐seq data) showing the top 15 pathways
  upregulated in TILs isolated from primary and abscopal tumors subjected to iRT in
  the presence or absence of bilateral TDLN. (D) Venn diagrams demonstrated the top
  15 upregulated pathways in the iRT vs. Con group and iRT vs. iRT + Res group of
  primary and abscopal tumors (n = 3 for each group). Abbreviations: TDLN, Tumor‐
  draining lymph nodes; TIL, Tumor‐ infiltrating lymphocytes; iRT, combined immunotherapy
  and radiotherapy; Res, bilateral TDLN resection; iRT + Res, iRT with bilateral TDLN
  resection; RNA‐seq, RNA‐sequencing; FC, fold change; non‐sig, non‐significant.'
