caption: 'Effect of IGFBP7 on the expression of phosphorylated (p-)SMAD2/3, SMAD2/3,
  and collagen I in the EC109 cell line. (A) The protein expression of p-SMAD2/3 and
  SMAD2/3 was examined by western blotting. (B) p-SMAD2/3 and SMAD2/3 ratio. (C) Western
  blotting for collagen I. β-actin served as an internal control (n=4). *P<0.05 vs.
  the control group; #P<0.05 vs. the 48-h group. IGFBP7, insulin-like growth factor-binding
  protein-7.'
article_title: IGFBP7 remodels the tumor microenvironment of esophageal squamous cell
  carcinoma by activating the TGFβ1/SMAD signaling pathway.
