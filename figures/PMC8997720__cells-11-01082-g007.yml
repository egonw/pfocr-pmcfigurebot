caption: Proteomics data on metabolic pathways. (A) Glycolysis pathway, Z-scored LFQ
  values of each glycolytic enzyme show that six out of 11 enzymes are significantly
  more abundant at low oxygen, overall indicating that glycolysis is upregulated at
  3% O2. (B) On the contrary, citric acid cycle enzymes are decreased, with four significantly
  different enzymes, pointing out a downregulation at low oxygen. (C) By contrast,
  pentose-phosphate pathway does not show any difference in any culture conditions.
