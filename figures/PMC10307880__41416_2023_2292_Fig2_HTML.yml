figure_title: The viral-mimicry response induced by DNMTis
caption: Upon DNMTi treatment, transposable elements (TEs) are induced to be transcribed
  and form double-strand RNA (dsRNA). The protein Stau1 and lncRNA TINCR are important
  for dsRNA stabilisation, and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is able
  to degrade dsRNA. After being identified by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the endosome
  and retinoic acid-inducible gene protein I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) in the cytoplasm, dsRNA hierarchically activates the expression
  of type I/III interferons (IFN-I/III). Upon recognition of IFN-I/III, JAK-STAT pathway
  is activated, and Phosphorylated STAT1/2 bind IRF9 and translocate into the nucleus
  to bind IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) to activate interferon-stimulated
  gene (ISG) transcription. PRC2 polycomb repressive complex 2, MAVS mitochondrial
  antiviral signalling protein, TLR3 toll-like receptor 3, TRAFs TNF receptor-associated
  factors, TBK1 TANK binding kinase 1, IRF interferon regulatory factor. Created with
