caption: 'Abnormal ERK/MAPK signaling pathway may damage epigenetic modifications
  of oocytes. (a) The subcellular localization and expression of 5-mC (red) in MII
  oocytes after different treatments. DAPI staining is shown in blue. Scale bar, 10 μm.
  (b) The relative levels of 5-mC in MII oocytes after different treatments: control
  (n = 48), spermine (n = 45), spermine+U0126 (n = 56), Ru360 (n = 60), and Ru360+curcumin
  (n = 36). (c) The subcellular localization and expression of 5-mC (red) in blastocysts
  developed from MII oocytes after different treatments. DAPI staining is shown in
  blue. Scale bar, 50 μm. (d) The relative levels of 5-mC in blastocysts developed
  from MII oocytes after different treatments: control (n = 48), spermine treatment
  (n = 30), spermine+U0126 treatment (n = 42), Ru360 treatment (n = 44), and Ru360+curcumin
  treatment (n = 37). One-way ANOVAs were used for statistical analyses. Different
  superscript letters (A–C) indicate significant differences of measurements in the
  same column (P < 0.05).'
