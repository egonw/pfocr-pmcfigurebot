caption: 'A flowchart identifying pancreatic cancer subtypes. For a group of normal
  samples, a reference background network can be constructed by the correlations between
  genes based on expression data of this group of samples. A new cancer sample S6
  is added to the group, and the perturbed network with this additional sample is
  built in the same way. The difference between the background and perturbed networks
  is due to sample S6. Edge perturbations for each individual sample are calculated
  by perturbed network and background network. Then, the pancreatic cancer samples
  are clustered by using a partition edge-perturbation matrix to reveal new network-based
  subtypes. The identified subtypes are characterized from different aspects, including
  prognosis, phenotypic traits, genetic mutations, immune cell infiltration, and therapeutic
  efficacy. We further performed pathway enrichment analysis for subtype-3 using all
  genes involved in the subtype-specific network. Abbreviations: S, sample; G, gene;
  E, edge.'
