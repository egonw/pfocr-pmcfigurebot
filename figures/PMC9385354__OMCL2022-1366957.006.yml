caption: 'Lys triggered ferroptosis via the Nrf2 pathway. After transfecting the HCT116
  and SW480 cells with an empty vector or Nrf2 for 18 hours, the cells were treated
  with Lys for an additional 24 hours. (a) Using immunoblotting, we examined the levels
  of Nrf2, GPX4, ferritin, and glutaminase expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells. (b)
  FerroOrange staining was used to determine the amount of iron present in HCT116
  and SW480 cells. (c) A flow cytometer was used to determine the ROS level; the mean
  and standard deviation are shown here, ∗P < 0.05. (d, e) Commercial kits were used
  to determine the GSH levels and MDA levels in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively.
  After being treated with Lys for 24 hours, the results were as follows: ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01.'
