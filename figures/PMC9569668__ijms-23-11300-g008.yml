caption: 'Ectopic expression of AEG-1/miR-221 dysregulates apoptosis and autophagy
  regulatory protein levels in HCC cell lines. The relative expressions of apoptosis
  (OPN and Bcl-2), autophagy (LC3A/B), PTEN, and PI3K/Akt proteins were analyzed by
  western blotting in the mock control, miR-221 mimic, miR-221 inhibitor, AEG-1 siRNA,
  and corresponding controls transfected HepG2 (A), Huh7 (B), and Hep3B (C) cells
  using β-actin as an internal control. Error bars are represented as mean ± s.d.
  and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared to the control
  group. ns: non-significance.'
