caption: 'Analysis of immunotherapy efficacy and the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs.
  The difference of immunotherapy efficacy between SLC7A5 high- and low-expression
  groups. (A) Without anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 regimens; (B) Anti-PD-1 regimen; (C)
  Anti-CTLA4 regimen; (D) Combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 regimens. (E) the
  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of SLC7A5 high- and low-expression groups in an independent
  immunotherapy cohort receiving anti-CTLA4 regimen. (F) the difference of response
  rates between SLC7A5 high- and low-expression groups with anti-CTLA4 regimen. CR:
  complete response; PR: partial response; SD: stable disease; PD: progressive disease.
  (CR/PR: SLC7A5 high-expression group vs SLC7A5 low-expression group: 19% vs 0%).
  The chemotherapy sensitivity between SLC7A5 high- and low-expression groups. Inhibitors
  of mTORC1 pathway: (G) CMK, (H) PF.4708671; inhibitors of cell cycle: (I) Cytarabine,
  (J) Docetaxel, (K) Paclitaxel, (L) RO.3306, (M) Roscovitine, (N) Vinblastine; growth
  factor signaling pathways: (O) OSI.906 (inhibitors of IGF-1R), (P) Axitinib (inhibitor
  of VEGFR).'
