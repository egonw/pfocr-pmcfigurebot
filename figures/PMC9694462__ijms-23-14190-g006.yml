caption: '5D3PC activates p38MAPK and SAPK/JNK. (A) WB analysis for the expressions
  of p-P38, p-JNK, and p-ERK in B16 cells treated with different concentrations (0-50
  µM) of 5D3PC. (B) B16 cells were pretreated with SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), SB203580
  (a p38MAPK inhibitor), and ERK inhibitor (PD98059) for 2 h and then incubated with
  5D3PC (50 µM) for 48 h to measure the melanin contents and 24 h to measure TYR activity.
  (C) The levels of p-P38 and p-JNK were determined by WB analysis in C57BL/6 mouse
  model treated with 5D3PC. All results are expressed as mean ± SD; statistical analysis
  was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. #p < 0.05, and ##p < 0.01 compared with
  only treated with 5D3PC.'
