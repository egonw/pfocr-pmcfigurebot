caption: Effect of baicalin treatment on the relative expression of genes involved
  in the TGF-β pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells evaluated by qPCR. MDA-MB-231 cells were
  treated with the indicated concentrations of baicalin for 24 h. The mRNA-level expression
  of (A) TGF-β, (B) ZEB1, (C) E-cadherin, and (D) N-cadherin was determined by qPCR
  analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The expression of those genes in
  untreated cells was set as 1. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation,
  *P < .05 vs untreated cells.

  via the TGF-β/lncRNA-MALAT1/miR-200c signaling pathway.
