caption: A rescue experiment was designed in the study to further prove that Igf1r
  overexpression rescues the effects of circDiaph3 knockdown in pulmonary artery smooth
  muscle cells (PASMCs) A, B Western blot analysis of α-SMA, Vcam1, and Igf1r signaling
  pathway proteins in PASMCs. C Immunostaining of α-SMA and VCAM1 in PASMCs. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation; *compared with the control group,
  p < 0.05
