caption: Hnf4αos knockout inhibits the inflammatory response during hepatic I/R injury.
  (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the major biological pathways. (B) Heatmap
  showing expression of inflammatory genes involved in HIRI. (C) TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6
  and MIP-2 levels after liver I/R were measured by ELISA. (D) Relative mRNA expression
  of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 and Mip-2 after liver I/R was examined by qRT-PCR (n = 5).
  (E) Representative immunofluorescence images of the Ly6G after I/R injury and the
  quantification of Ly6G-positive cell ratio. The scale bar represents 25 μm. (F)
  Western blot analysis of p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, and p65 and the relative band density.
  n.s. P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
