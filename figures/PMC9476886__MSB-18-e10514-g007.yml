figure_title: wt and tax‐6 mutants show similar response dynamics following optogenetic
  stimulation
caption: A AWA calcium dynamics of wt and tax‐6(p675) mutants ( worms respectively)
  in response to three repeated light activations (488 nm). Each worm was illuminated
  thrice, each for 1‐min long with 1‐min rest between consecutive stimulations. Responses
  are shown as fold differences in fluorescence from the first captured frame.B Peak
  amplitudes as measured for each of the activations. Following light activation,
  and in contrast to the response to diacetyl, response of tax‐6 mutants was not stronger
  than the response of wt worms ( Wilcoxon rank‐sum test between the amplitudes of
  wt and tax‐6(p675) in response to the first or third light activation, respectively).
  Black bars mark the median. Horizontal lines denote the compared groups. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005.C Median response dynamics of wt and tax‐6(p675) worms
  for the first light activation. The two strains show similar activation dynamics.
  All responses were aligned to their maximal activation levels prior to extraction
  of the median values. Shaded‐colored area marks mean absolute deviation.D Activations
  from the same worm tend to cluster together indicating a low in‐worm variability,
  while the between‐worm variability is high. The first 30 s in each of the three
  light activations of the 10 wt worms shown in (A) were normalized by the maximal
  amplitude and decomposed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Shown are the
  projections of each activation to the first two PCs (capturing 90% and 6% of the
  variance, respectively). Each color represents a single worm (three activations
  for each worm). Colored dashed lines were added manually.  Source data are available
  online for this figure.
