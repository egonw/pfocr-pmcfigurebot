caption: Effect of LBAG on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in rats. (a) Cardiac apoptosis
  was assessed by TUNEL staining (magnification, ×200). (b) Positive apoptosis cells
  in each group. (c) Western blot analysis and statistical analysis of (d) Bax, (e)
  cleaved caspase-3, and (f) Bcl-2 proteins in each group. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs. sham group. ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. IR group.
