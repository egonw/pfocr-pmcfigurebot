caption: 'PINK1 down-regulates LRRK2 protein level via facilitation of LRRK2 protein
  degradation in a PINK 1 kinase activity-dependent manner. A–C PINK1 KO up-regulate
  LRRK2 protein level in human HAP1 cells. A Representative Western blot data of LRRK2
  levels in PINK1 KO HAP1 cells. B Densitometric analysis of LRRK2 bands in Western
  blot gels in A. *P < 0.01, compared with the arbitrary value of LRRK2 bands in control
  HAP1 cells. C PINK1 KO has no influence on LRRK2 transcript level in HAP1 cells.
  *P < 0.001, compared with the expression level of PINK1 in control HAP1 cells. D–F
  Stable transfection of WT PINK1 down-regulate LRRK2 protein level, whereas stable
  transfection of mutant A339T or E231G PINK1 up-regulate LRRK2 protein level in SH-SY5Y
  cells. D Representative Western blot data of LRRK2 level in empty vector, WT or
  mutant A339T or E231G PINK1 stably transfected cells. E Densitometric analysis of
  LRRK2 bands in Western blot gels in D. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary
  value of LRRK2 protein bands in empty vector transfected cells. F Quantitative real-time
  RT-PCR analysis of PINK1 and LRRK2 expression in stably transfected cells. *, at
  least P < 0.001, compared with PINK1 transcript level of empty vector transfected
  cells. G–J WT, but not mutant G309D PINK1 down-regulate LRRK2 protein level in double
  TG Drosophila heads. Single or double TG WT or mutant LRRK2 and/or PINK1 lines are
  crossed with ddc-GAL4 line to induce expressions of PINK1 and/or LRRK2 in DA neurons
  in Drosophila heads. Drosophila heads are harvested after 3 days culture, homogenized
  and subjected to Western blot analysis of PINK1 protein level. G–I Representative
  Western blot data of LRRK2 bands in Drosophila heads of control, single or double
  TG Drosophila. G Mutant G309D PINK1 and/or mutant G2019S LRRK2 Drosophila; H mutant
  G309D PINK1 and/or WT LRRK2 Drosophila; I WT PINK1 and/or WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2
  Drosophila. J Densitometric analysis of LRRK2 bands in Western blot gels in G, H
  and I. *, at least P < 0.01, compared with the arbitrary value of LRRK2 bands in
  Drosophila heads of WT or mutant G2019S LRRK2 single TG Drosophila. (K and L) WT
  PINK1 promotes proteasome degradation of LRRK2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells. K Representative
  Western blot data of LRRK2 levels in empty vector or WT PINK1 stably transfected
  cells treated with or without 3 µM MG132 for 6 h. L Densitometric analysis of LRRK2
  bands in Western blot gels in K. *, at least P < 0.05, compared with the arbitrary
  value of LRRK2 bands of respective cells without MG132 treatment. #P < 0.05, compared
  with the arbitrary value of LRRK2 bands of empty vector transfected cells without
  MG132 treatment'
