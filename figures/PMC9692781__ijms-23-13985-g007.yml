caption: Validation of PD model in athymic rats featuring a 6-OHDA lesion of the SNpc.
  Athymic rats lesioned by the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-OHDA injected into the SNpc
  were used as surgical subjects for the in vivo studies. (a) Representative confocal
  reconstruction of the non-lesioned side of the rat brain labeled via immunocytochemistry
  to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red). As expected, the non-lesioned side
  demonstrated significant TH labeling within the striatum. (b) Representative confocal
  reconstruction of the lesioned side of the rat brain labeled via immunohistochemistry
  to denote dopaminergic neurons/axons (TH, red). The lesioned side of the brain demonstrated
  minimal TH labeling in the striatal region—especially in dorsal striatum—validating
  the efficacy of the 6-OHDA lesion in destroying dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc
  and their axons within the nigrostriatal pathway. (c,d) Evoked dopamine release
  was investigated in slices from both the non-lesioned and lesioned sides of the
  brain using FSCV. (c) Representative color plot (bottom), cyclic voltammogram (inset),
  and time vs. concentration plot (top) of the evoked dopamine release recorded in
  the non-lesioned side of the brain (n = 3) as potential of the carbon fiber electrode
  was linearly scanned from −0.4 to 1.2 V and back to −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl every 100
  ms. The cyclic voltammogram exhibited an oxidation peak between 0.55 and 0.65 V
  and a reduction trough between −0.2 and −0.3 V, which are characteristic of dopamine.
  The maximum concentrations of dopamine released by the non-lesioned side were over
  300 nM. (d) Representative color plot (bottom), cyclic voltammogram (inset), and
  time vs. concentration plot (top) of the evoked dopamine release recorded in the
  lesioned side of the brain (n = 3). The cyclic voltammogram did not exhibit peaks
  or troughs representative of dopamine, and no discernable concentration of dopamine
  was recorded. These findings validated the functional consequences of the 6-OHDA
  lesion in destroying dopaminergic neurons/axons of the nigrostriatal pathway. Scale
  bar (a,b) = 1 mm.
