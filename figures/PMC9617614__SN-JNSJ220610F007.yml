caption: Impacts of chronic IGF-1 or IGF-1+Let treatment on hippocampal MAPK and Akt
  pathway activation. Middle-aged female rats were ovariectomized and treated with
  Veh, IGF-1, or IGF-1+Let. After rats were tested on the radial-arm maze, hippocampi
  were dissected and processed for Western blotting for phosphorylated and total levels
  of p44-MAPK, p42-MAPK, and Akt. Phosphorylated levels were normalized to the total
  protein levels and expressed as a percentage of the Veh group mean. Graph represents
  mean D×A ± SEM expressed as a percentage of the vehicle group. There was an effect
  of treatment (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of p44-MAPK (A) and p42-MAPK (B),
  with post hoc testing revealing increased phosphorylation of both MAPK phosphorylation
  sites in the IGF-1 group compared with the Veh group. There was an effect of treatment
  (p < 0.05) on phosphorylated levels of Akt (C), with post hoc testing revealing
  increased phosphorylation in both the IGF-1 and IGF-1+Let groups compared with Veh
  group. *p < 0.05 versus Veh.
