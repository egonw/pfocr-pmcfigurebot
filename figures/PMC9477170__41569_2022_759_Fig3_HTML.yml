figure_title: Inflammation resolution concept
caption: In response to injury or infection, acute inflammation is activated to favour
  the return to homeostasis. During the initiation phase, damage signals (pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) promote
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-induced accumulation of arachidonic acid (AA), activation
  of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  leading to the release of pro-inflammatory substances, recruitment of polymorphonuclear
  leukocytes (PMNs) and monocyte polarization towards pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.
  Apoptotic PMNs and M1 macrophages secrete 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) and 15-LOX, which
  triggers lipid-mediator class switching, signalled by increased production of resolution-promoting
  mediators from AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Pro-resolution
  autacoids orchestrate the inhibition of PMN infiltration, the increased release
  of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13) and increased macrophage polarization
  to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to phagocytize damaged cells. Inflammation resolution
  is characterized by efferocytosis, tissue repair, wound healing, preservation of
  functions and homeostasis. Failed resolution of inflammation is associated with
  dysfunctional triggering of lipid-mediator class switching, perpetuation of production
  and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-18), aggravation
  and chronicity of the inflammatory status, development of fibrosis, myocardial damage,
  loss of myocardial function and arrhythmogenesis. CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
