figure_title: IFNmod treatment suppresses gene expression of ISGs, inflammation and
  neutrophil degranulation in the BAL of SARS-CoV-2 infected NHPs
caption: Bulk RNA-Seq profiles of BAL cell suspensions obtained at −7 dpi (n = 9 for
  each arm), 2 dpi (n = 9 per arm), 4 dpi (n = 6 per arm), and 7 dpi (n = 3 per arm).
  (a) Heatmap of longitudinal gene expression in BAL prior to and following SARS-CoV-2
  infection for the ISG gene panel. The color scale indicates log2 expression relative
  to the mean of all samples. Samples obtained while the animals were receiving IFNmod
  administration are depicted by a blue bar. (b) Distribution of log2 fold-changes
  of select ISGs relative to baseline. Filled dots represent the mean, and lighter
  dots are individual data points. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (padj
  < 0.05) of gene expression relative to baseline within treatment groups; black horizontal
  bars indicate p-values of direct contrasts of the gene expression between groups
  at time-points (i.e. IFNmod vs Untreated). (c-e) GSEA enrichment plots depicting
  pairwise comparison of gene expression of 2 dpi samples vs −7 dpi samples within
  treatment groups. The untreated group is depicted by red symbols, and data for the
  IFNmod treated group is shown in blue. The top-scoring (i.e. leading edge) genes
  are indicated by solid dots. The hash plot under GSEA curves indicate individual
  genes and their rank in the dataset. Left-leaning curves (i.e. positive enrichment
  scores) indicate enrichment, or higher expression, of pathways at 2 dpi, right-leaning
  curves (negative enrichment scores) indicate higher expression at −7 dpi. Sigmoidal
  curves indicate a lack of enrichment, i.e. equivalent expression between the groups
  being compared. The normalized enrichment scores and nominal p-values testing the
  significance of each comparison are indicated. Genesets were obtained from the MSIGDB
  (Hallmark and Canonical Pathways) database. (f-h) Heatmaps of longitudinal gene
  expression after SARS-CoV-2. Genes plotted are the top 10 genes in the leading edge
  of geneset enrichment analysis calculated in panels c-e for each pathway in the
  Untreated 2 dpi vs −7 dpi comparison. (i-l) Longitudinal gene expression for selected
  DEGs in immune signaling pathways. The expression scale is depicted in the top right
  of panel A.
