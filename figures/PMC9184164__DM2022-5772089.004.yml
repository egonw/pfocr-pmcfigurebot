caption: 'ATF-2 was knocked down in NSCLC cells, and the Wnt pathway agonist was added
  to detect pathway activity and cell proliferation activity. (a, b) qPCR and WB were
  used to detect the activity of downstream factors and determine the efficiency of
  agonists in the pathway. (c) WB was used to detect the expression of pathway proteins
  in different treatment groups. (d) CCK8 was used to detect cell proliferation. (e)
  Transwell tested the invasion ability of cells. Compared to the control group, âˆ—P
  < 0.05; compared to the si-ATF-2 group, #P < 0.05; the difference was statistically
  significant.'
