caption: 'SS extract blocks LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB. (a–c) Western blot analyses
  showing changes in the total and phosphorylated forms of components of NF-κB and
  AP-1 signaling pathways in cells pretreated with specific inhibitors (a) or the
  SS extract (SS) (b, c) for 24 h and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 30 min. Densitometric
  analysis was performed using ImageJ software. (d) A reporter gene assay showing
  regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity by the SS extract in RAW 264.7 cells
  stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of the SS extract for 6 h.
  The bars represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD); ∗: P < 0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗: P < 0.001 compared with the indicated group. SS, Sargassum siliquastrum;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; AP-1, activator protein-1.'
