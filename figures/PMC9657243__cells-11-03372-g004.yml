caption: Select precuneal water-scaled MRS metabolite concentrations (mmol/L) over
  the three study visits. Standard error bars indicate the water-scaled concentration
  of Creatine (Cr), Glutamine (Gln), myo-Inositol (Ins), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA),
  Acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Statistical analysis involved
  repeated-measures linear mixed models with “Visit” as the repeated-measures variable
  and concentration as the dependent variable. Additional factors and covariates are
  detailed in the Statistical Methods . Bars and error bars are shown for baseline
  (visit 1 t0 (1)), 24 h after the first dose (visit 2 t24 (2)), and 24 h after the
  last dose (visit 3 t24 (3)). Significant results for the omnibus test across all
  three visits are indicated by a black horizontal bar above the individual plot,
  with the p-value above.
