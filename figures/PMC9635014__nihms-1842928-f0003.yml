figure_title: Oncogenic driver signaling pathway and pro-apoptotic proteins account
  for differences between UM vs CM
caption: (a) ATP assay data of single drug treatments of S64315 combined with MEKi
  trametinib on CM cell lines. (b) Immunoblot with lysates collected after 24 h treatment
  with DMSO, or MEKi, and then probed for indicated proteins. Molecular weight markers
  are in kD. (c) ATP assay with control (sh control) or knockdown (KD) of PUMA (sh
  PUMA), BIM (sh BIM), BAD (sh BAD), and BMF (sh BMF) in Mel202 UM line to test response
  to MCL1i. (d) Immunoblots confirming the KD for . For Figure a and c, Y-axis shows
  percentage of relative viability and X-axis indicates the dosages of drug in Î¼M.
  *** indicates p < 0.001.
