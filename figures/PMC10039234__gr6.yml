caption: Metabolomics revealed the effects of aerobic exercise training and dietary
  lipid content on the nonvolatile metabolites in the flesh of gibel carp. (A) Pathway
  enrichment analysis (top 25) of pathway enrichment in MFN VS MFT. (B) Pathway enrichment
  analysis (top 25) of pathway enrichment in MFN VS HFN. (C) Pathway enrichment analysis
  (top 25) of pathway enrichment in HFN VS HFT. The x-axis represents the enrichment
  ratio, while the y-axis represents the enrichment pathway. (D) PCA score plots based
  on metabolomics profiles of muscle. (E) Metabolic pathways affected by aerobic exercise
  training and dietary lipid content in muscle. Red arrows indicate changes in metabolites
  induced by aerobic exercise training. Blue arrows indicate changes in metabolites
  induced by a high-fat diet. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
article_title: Exercise training combined with a high-fat diet improves the flesh
  flavour, texture and nutrition of gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio).
