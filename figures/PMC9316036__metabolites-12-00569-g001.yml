caption: Schematic representation of reactions involved in the biosynthesis of NAD
  in different organisms. Metabolite names are written in bold blue letters, while
  the enzyme names are denoted in green colour. The abbreviation NCE (NAD-consuming
  enzymes) represents all enzymes catalysing signalling reactions consuming NAD. The
  bold black lines represent enzyme-catalysed reactions, whereas the dotted red lines
  denote non-enzymatic hydrolysis, mainly occurring at high temperatures. Bold yellow
  lines are used to denote reactions that require ATP. Whether the bacterial 5′-nucleotidase
  SurE accepts NMN/NAMN as substrate is unknown; a homologue to the mammalian NT5
  could not be identified in bacteria. NAD, Nam adenine dinucleotide; NMN, Nam mononucleotide;
  NR, Nam riboside; NA, nicotinic acid; NAR, NA riboside; NAMN, NA mononucleotide;
  NAAD, NA adenine dinucleotide; NadD, NA/NMN adenylyltransferase; Nampt, Nam phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NadR, NA/Nam riboside kinase; SurE, 5′-nucleotidase; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase;
  PncA, nicotinamidase; PncB, NA phosphoribosyltransferase; NadE, NAD synthase.
