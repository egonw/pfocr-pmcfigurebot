figure_title: Pathways of mitophagy
caption: 'A Parkin-dependent mitophagy: While mitochondria became damaged (pink),
  PINK1 is accumulated on the OMM, promoting Parkin recruitment to ubiquitinate several
  outer membrane components. Phosphorylated Poly-Ub chains on mitochondrial proteins
  modify other proteins and serve as an ‘eat me’ signal for the autophagic machinery.
  TBK1 interacts with Ub chains by phosphorylating OPTN, which promotes mitochondrial
  clearance. The PINK1-Parkin pathway modulates mitochondrial dynamics and inhibits
  damaged mitochondria entering the mitochondrial network by targeting Mfn and Miro
  for proteasomal degradation. B Other pathways of Parkin-independent mitophagy: (1)
  Bnip3, Bnip3L/Nix, FUNDC1 and other receptor-mediated mitophagy; (2) Lipid-mediated
  mitophagy; (3) E3 ubiquitin ligases or ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy; (4) Mitophagy
  and mitochondrial dynamics. Mitophagy receptors such as BNIP3 and FUNDC1 promote
  the fission of damaged organelles through the disassembly and release of OPA1 and
  the recruitment of DRP1.'
