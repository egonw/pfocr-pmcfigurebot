caption: 'HTR2A agonist DOI induces melanogenesis in B16F10 cells: (a) Masson–Fonta
  staining of B16F10 cells treated with HTR2A agonist DOI (10, 20, and 30 μM) and
  α-MSH (50 nM) used as a positive control. Scale bar, 50 μm; (b,c) relative tyrosinase
  activity (b) and melanin content (c) in B16F10 cells treated with different concentrations
  of DOI (1, 10, 20, and 30 μM) as compared with the control (n = 6). The photos of
  melanin precipitation in the tube are at the top of the diagram (c); (d) Western
  blot shows the protein expression of melanin synthesis, MITF, and TYR in B16F10
  cells treated with DOI (1, 10, 20, and 30 μM); (e) Masson–Fonta staining of B16F10
  cells with the treatment of DOI (30 μM), HTR2A antagonist AT1015 (3 μM), and cotreatment.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. * (p < 0.05) and ** (p < 0.01) compared to control group.'
