caption: '(A) Left ventricle tissue from healthy donor tissue was dissected, snap
  frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cryopulverized. (B) Metabolites (polar metabolites
  and lipids) were extracted using multiple solvent mixtures including monophasic
  (100% MeOH, 80% MeOH and 3:3:2 ACN: IPA: H2O), biphasic (Matyash and Bligh and Dyer)
  and triphasic (3 phase liquid extraction, 3PLE) extraction methods; all extractions
  were done in triplicate. (C) Extracted metabolites were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution
  mass spectrometry direct infusion Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (DI-FTICR,
  Bruker SolariX 12T) and high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight
  tandem mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF MS/MS, Bruker Impact II) (D) Raw mass spectrometry
  data was analyzed where metabolic features were extracted and annotated. Further,
  metabolite classification and pathway analysis were performed to determine biological
  relevance. MeOH = methanol, ACN= acetonitrile, IPA= 2-propanol and H2O= water. Figure
