caption: Overlap of metabolomic- and transcriptomic-predicted pathway dysregulation
  (as observed from cell pellets) in safranal-treated HCC cells. Maps show metabolites
  (gray dots), edges with no evidence (gray edges), transcriptomic reaction dysregulation
  evidence (green edges), metabolomic reaction dysregulation evidence (blue edges),
  and reaction dysregulation evidence from both omics experiments (bold black edges)
  after safranal treatment. Metabolites and their respective metabolic pathways were
  identified using LC/MS–QToF and Mummichog (http://mummichog.org/, accessed on 20
  March 2021) in XCMS and their overlaps with those identified from RNAseq analysis
  (black edges, panels A–C). (A) Overview of metabolic dysregulation evidence from
  the dual omics experiments visualized in the Interactive Pathways Explorer v3 (https://pathways.embl.de/,
  accessed 29 May 2021). (B) Lipid biosynthesis dysregulation after safranal treatment
  (see also ). (C) Steroid biosynthesis dysregulation after safranal treatment (see
  also ). (D) Overlap of metabolomics and transcriptomics dysregulated metabolic reactions
  from CAS and EC numbers. Metabolite accessions were retrieved from the Chemical
  Abstract Service (CAS) using the METLIN (https://metlin.scripps.edu, accessed 4
  May 2021) batch search tool, ECs were retrieved from transcripts using EC Domain
  Miner []. The CAS and EC accession numbers were compared in iPATH3 (https://pathways.embl.de/,
  accessed 29 May 2021) to detect dysregulated.
