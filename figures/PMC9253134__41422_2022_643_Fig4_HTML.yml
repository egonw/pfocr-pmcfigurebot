figure_title: scRNA-seq analysis identified Lepr+ cell-derived Igf1 as an important
  niche signal
caption: a Schematic diagram of Lepr+ MCs sorted from intestinal crypts of Lepr-Cre;mTmG
  mice before or 3 days post-irradiation, capture of single cells by droplet-based
  device, 3ʹ-scRNA-seq, and downstream query and comparative analyses. b Sub-cluster
  of anchored and integrated (n = 30 anchors each) Lepr+ fibroblasts (k = 1923 cells)
  visualized in t-SNE embedding. Feature plots of Lepr and eGFP expression based on
  normalized counts and visualized on t-SNE embedding. c Lepr+ fibroblasts split by
  condition (before IR, k = 619 viable cells; 3 dpi, k = 1304 viable cells). d Quantification
  of the percentage of Lepr+ fibroblasts per cluster split by condition. e Heatmap
  showing top 10 ligands expressed in Lepr+ fibroblasts before and 3 days post-irradiation
  and percentage of cells in each condition expressing such ligand at gene/features
  counts > 0. f Feature plots of Igf1 expression based on normalized counts and visualized
  on t-SNE embedding and split by condition. g Violin plot of Igf1 expression based
  on normalized counts in Lepr+ fibroblast clusters across conditions. **P < 0.01
  (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). h In situ hybridization for Igf1 in jejunum
  of 8-week-old mice before and 3 days post-irradiation (n = 3). Scale bar, 25 μm.
  i qRT-PCR analysis for Igf1 in Lepr+ and Lepr– cells from Lepr-Cre;mTmG mice before
  or 3 days post-irradiation (n = 3). j, k In situ hybridization for Igf1 and Lepr
  in jejunum of 8-week-old mice before (j) or 3 days post-irradiation (k). The white
  dashed line represents the border between intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme in
  crypts. Insets on the right represent large magnification of yellow selected areas.
  Yellow dash lines in the insets indicate the border of individual cells. Graph showing
  quantification of the percentage of Lepr+Igf1+ and Lepr–Igf1+ cells in each crypt
  from WT mice (n = 3). Scale bar, 15 μm. l, m Circle plots showing inferred IGF signaling
  between Lepr+ fibroblasts (FIB1-IV) and Msi1+ intestinal epithelial cells before
  irradiation (l) and 3 days post irradiation (m) (cluster stem cells-I (SC-I)), cluster
  stem cells-II (SC-II), cluster EC precursors (ECP), cluster EC and cluster EC precursor-like
  cells (ECPL). Data of epithelial cells were adapted from our previous study. The
  size of the circle is proportional to the number of cells in each cell cluster and
  the edge connecting the circles represent the communication probability between
  any two cell groups. The color of the edge denotes directionality (i.e., senders
  vs receivers). The heatmap shows the relative importance of each cell group based
  on the computed network centrality for sender, receiver, mediator and influencer
  for IGF signaling pathway network. Graphs represent the quantification of the relative
  contributions of individual ligand–receptor pairs to the overall IGF communication
  network. n Immunohistochemistry for Igf1r, Lgr5-GFP, Olfm4 and Sox9 in serial sections
  of jejunum from Lgr5-eGFP-CreERT2 mice (n = 3). Scale bar, 100 μm. o Immunohistochemistry
  for Igf1r, Olfm4 and Sox9 in serial sections of jejunum from WT mice 3 days post-irradiation
  (n = 3). Scale bar, 100 μm. Values in the graphs represent means ± SD. Unpaired
  Student’s t-test was used for calculating P values in i and k. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001.
