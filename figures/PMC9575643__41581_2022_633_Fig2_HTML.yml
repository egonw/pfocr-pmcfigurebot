  trained immunity
caption: Different methodologies can be used to assess trained immunity in innate
  immune cells. Flow cytometry can be used to quantify the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6, in fixed and permeabilized
  innate immune cells after restimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Several studies
  have also used ELISA to measure the pro-inflammatory cytokine response (IL-6, TNF
  and IL-1β) of trained monocytes in vitro and in vivo,. In vitro, trained innate
  immune cells have higher basal and maximal mitochondrial activity, which can be
  assessed using colorimetric or fluorometric assays to provide insights into trained
  immunity. For example, cultured trained innate immune cells produce protons via
  the lactate pathway and the acidification of the culture medium can be assessed
  by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as an indicator of glycolysis,
  whereas the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) can be used as a measure of oxidative
  phosphorylation,. Seahorse XF analysers can be used to obtain an in-depth analysis
  of a variety of mitochondrial functions in single cells in vitro with relatively
  high throughput through the use of compounds that perturb the cellular bioenergetic
  profile. Specifically, the sequential addition of oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor),
  FCCP (mitochondrial uncoupler), and a combination of the complex I inhibitor (rotenone)
  and complex III inhibitor (antimycin A) provides information on three key parameters
  of mitochondrial activation — ATP turnover, proton leak and maximal respiration,.
  Finally, induction of trained immunity can also be investigated by evaluating chromatin
  remodelling, using tools such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), assay for
  transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), cleavage under targets
  and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) and cleavage under targets and tagmentation
  (CUT&Tag).
