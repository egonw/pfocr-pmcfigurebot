figure_title: Global activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in patients
  with progressive disease compared to responders
caption: Box plots with median (center line) and maximum and minimum values (whiskers)
  show a statistically significant increase in the activation levels of many members
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the tumor epithelium of patients with
  progressive disease compared to responders; p values for two-sided chi-square tests
  for dichotomized levels of measured biomarkers (above/below the population median)
  are shown.

  inhibition in metastatic breast cancers.
