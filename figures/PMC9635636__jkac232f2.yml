caption: 'tra-1 regulates the SGP/hmc cell fate decision. a) The C. elegans sex determination
  pathway. Arrows indicate positive regulatory relationships; bars indicate negative
  regulatory relationships. The ratio of the number of X chromosomes to autosomes
  (X: A) determines the activity of xol-1 which is transmitted through a series of
  negative regulatory interactions to ultimately regulate the activity of tra-1. The
  sdc genes also regulate dosage compensation. sex-1 and tra-1 (bold) lie at opposite
  ends of the pathway. b) Expression of arg-1::GFP in SGPs of tra-1 and sex-1 RNAi
  or loss-of-function mutants (XX animals) compared to wild-type XX hermaphrodites
  and XO males.'
