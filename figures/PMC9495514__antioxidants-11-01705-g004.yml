caption: 'The effect of ICS II on oxidative injury in liver of db/db mice. (a) Representative
  DHE staining in the liver (×100, scale bar = 200 μm). (b) Quantitation of DHE staining.
  After the calculation of intensity per image, the signal intensity was divided by
  the captured area and expressed as folds of WT group (n = 5). (c) ROS level (n =
  8). (d) MDA level (n = 8). (e) GSH-Px activity (n = 8). (f) GSH activity (n = 8).
  (g) SOD activity (n = 8). (h) SOD1 activity (n = 8). (i) SOD2 activity (n = 8).
  (j) SOD3 activity (n = 8). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01 versus
  WT group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus db/db group.'
