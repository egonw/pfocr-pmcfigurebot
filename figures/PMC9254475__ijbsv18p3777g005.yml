caption: hsa-miR-340-3p inhibits the migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.
  a-d Representative images of wound healing assay for two cell lines transfected
  with corelated plasmids. b and d revealed quantification of the data shown in a
  and c. e-f Representative images of colony formation assay for PANC-1 and CFPAC-1.
  g-h Representative images of the migration ability of PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 by Transwell
  assay. Each experiment was performed three times independently and results are presented
  as mean Â± s.d. Student's t-test was used to analyze the data. (*p < 0.05; **p <
  0.01; ***p < 0.001)
article_title: HTR1D functions as a key target of HOXA10-AS/miR-340-3p axis to promote
