caption: Experimental groups and treatments. In the 1st phase of the study, the concentration-dependent
  group included hippocampal neurons that were incubated with fresh maintenance medium,
  a fat emulsion, and different concentrations of propofol for 3 h. In the time-dependent
  group, the hippocampal neurons were incubated with fresh medium, a fat emulsion
  and propofol (100 µM) for 3, 6, and 9 h, respectively. In the 2nd phase of the study,
  the hippocampal neurons were incubated with fresh maintenance medium, a fat emulsion,
  0.25% DMSO, propofol (100 µM), compound C, AICAR, tenovin-1 and pifithrin-α for
  different times. Group C, control, fresh maintenance medium; Group F, fat emulsion;
  Group P1, 1 µM propofol; Group P10, 10 µM propofol; Group P100, 100 µM propofol;
  Group P3, 100 µM propofol for 3 h; Group P6, 100 µM propofol for 6 h; Group P9,
  100 µM propofol for 9 h; Group D, 0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide; Group P, 100 µM propofol
  for 3 h; Group CC, 10 µM compound C for 1 h; Group PA, 100 µM 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide for 3 h and 100 µM propofol for 3 h; Group T, 5 µM tenovin-1 for
  24 h; Group PP, 10 µM pifithrin-α for 1 h and100 µM propofol for 3 h. DMSO, dimethyl
  sulfoxide; AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside.
