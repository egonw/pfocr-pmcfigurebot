caption: Cordycepin, radiation, and the combination treatment decreased MA-10 cell
  viability in dose-dependent manners. MA-10 cells were treated with 0, 10, 25, 50,
  100 and 200 μM cordycepin for 24 hr (A, D), with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy radiation for
  24 hr (B, E), and with the combination treatments of cordycepin and radiation for
  24 hr (C, F), respectively. The morphology of cells was examined using light microscope
  and images were captured by digital camera (A-C). Cell viabilities were examined
  by Trypan blue exclusion test (D-F). Results were presented as percentages of cell
  growth relative to control groups. CalcuSyn software analysis was used to determine
  the synergistic effects of combination treatment of cordycepin and radiation on
  MA-10 cells (G). **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 indicate significant statistical difference
  compared to the control group. The data points at “a” and “b” indicate the synergies.
