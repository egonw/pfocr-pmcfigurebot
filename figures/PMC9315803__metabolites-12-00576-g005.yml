caption: 'The mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation level of key regulators
  related to target of rapamycin (TOR) and amino acid response (AAR) signaling pathways
  in muscle. (a) mRNA expression level of TOR signaling pathway; (b) mRNA expression
  of AAR signaling pathway; (c) protein phosphorylation level of TOR and AAR signaling
  pathways. Data were represented as mean ± SEM. Different letters above the bars
  denote significant differences between diet groups at the p < 0.05 level. Note:
  TOR, target of rapamycin; S6, S6 Ribosomal Protein. 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein 1; eIF2α, initiation elongation factor alpha; ATF4, activating
  transcription factor 4; CHOP, channelopsin2; REDD1, regulated in development and
  DNA damage responses 1; AKT, protein kinase B.'
