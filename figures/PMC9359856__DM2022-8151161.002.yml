caption: 'Relative expressions of PTEN. The expression of PTEN protein was decreased
  in the mimic miRNA-29a-3p group, while in the inhibitor miRNA-29a-3p group, the
  expression of PTEN protein was increased (∗∗∗: p < 0.001). For each different group,
  the SH-SY5Y cells were separately repeatedly measured 6 times.'
