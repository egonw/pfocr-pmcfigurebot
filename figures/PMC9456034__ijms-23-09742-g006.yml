caption: 103+-EVs and 103−-EVs induced cytokines secretion was regulated by TLR2 signaling
  pathway. (A) J774A.1 cells were co-incubated with 103+-EVs or 103−-EVs at concentrations
  of 5 μg/mL for 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, the protein of TLR2 was detected by western
  blotting. The results of western blotting were analyzed by gray scale. Inhibitors
  of TLR2 (C29, 100 μM) was used to pretreat for 1 h before stimulation J774A.1 cells
  with 103+-EVs or 103−-EVs at concentrations of 5 μg/mL for 24 h, and then detected
  the protein levels of (B) IL-1β, (C) IL-6, (D) TNF-α, and (E) IL-10 in the culture
  supernatants by ELISA. (F) Inhibitors of TLR2 (C29, 100μM) was used to pretreat
  for 1 h before stimulation J774A.1 cells with 103+-EVs or 103−-EVs at concentrations
  of 5 μg/mL for 15 min, and then detected the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, p38,
  ERK and JNK protein by western blotting. The results of western blotting were analyzed
  by gray scale. Relative gray value shows the ratio of (G) Phospho-NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB
  p65) to total NF-κB p65 protein, (H) Phospho-p38 (p38) to total p38 protein, (I)
  Phospho-ERK (p-ERK) to total ERK protein, and (J) Phospho-JNK (p-JNK) to total JNK
  protein. The data were compared with the control cells. The comparisons between
  groups were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and ns, not significant.
