caption: 'Effect of DNL on protein expression of MAPK and NF-κB/IκB in TNF-α/IFN-induced
  HaCaT cells. (A) MAPK protein expression in TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells was
  confirmed by Western blot. (B) p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 were normalized using the
  ImageJ program by T-ERK, t-JNK, and t-p38, respectively. (C) The phosphorylation
  of the signaling pathway of NF-κB/IκB in TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells was confirmed
  by Western blot. (D) Phosphorylation of p-NF-κB was normalized by Lamin B, and IκB
  was normalized by Actin. Normalization was performed through the ImageJ program.
  The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). ## p < 0.01, compared with the normal
  group. * p < 0.05 compared with the control group.'
