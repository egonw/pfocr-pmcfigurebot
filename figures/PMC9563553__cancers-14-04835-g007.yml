caption: '(A) The univariate logistic model for the variables that showed a statistically
  significant effect on pCR. (B) The multivariate logistic model which includes all
  the variables showing a significant impact on pCR in the univariate model. (C,D)
  The distribution of Sig_TAZ_YAP_HMGCR_SCD1 in the two categories of ER (ER > 70%
  vs. Others) and BMI (BMI > 20 vs. Others), respectively. Statistical comparison
  was performed using the Chi-squared test. Abbreviations: ER_70 = estrogen receptor
  with cut-off at 70% (ER > 70% vs. Others); BMI_20 = body mass index with cut-off
  of 20 (BMI > 20 vs. Others); Sig_TAZ_YAP_HMGCR_SCD1 = signature of cytoplasmic TAZ
  score 0–1, nuclear YAP score 0–1, nuclear HMGCR score 0, and cytoplasmic SCD1 score
  1–3. Suffixes: _C = cytoplasmic; SxP_irs_c = categorized international immunoreactive
  score.'
