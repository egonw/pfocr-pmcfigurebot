figure_title: SIRT5 proviral activity is independent of the MAVS signaling pathway
caption: 'A. Western blot showing 90% reduction of MAVS in A549-A/T cells transduced
  with a CRISPR lentivirus against MAVS. A549-A/T cells stably co-express ACE2 and
  TMPRSS2. B. Viral titers in MAVS-KD cells treated with DMSO or SIRT5 inhibitor Sirt5-i,
  after infection with SARS-Cov-2 for 3 days at MOI = 0.1, as shown by plaque assay.
  Sirt5-i had a similar effect in WT and MAVS-KO, suggesting that SIRT5 function is
  independent of MAVS. n = 9. C. RT-qPCR of GFP or Nsp14 after doxycycline induction.
  WT and SIRT5-KO A549-ACE2 cells were stably transduced with doxycycline-inducible
  constructs for GFP and Nsp14. After doxycycline treatment for 48 hours at 100ng/mL,
  GFP was strongly overexpressed, but Nsp14 failed to be expressed. Data show fold-changes
  compared to the first column (WT cells transduced with GFP without doxycycline),
  after normalization with ACTIN. n = 4. D. Hypotheses for the role of the SIRT5/Nsp14
  interaction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In model 1, Nsp14 could enhance SIRT5 activity,
  which would decrease innate immune responses and favor viral replication. In model
  2, Nsp14 could redirect SIRT5 to novel targets, potentially in the replication-transcription
  complex, where SIRT5 could deacylate other viral proteins. In model 3, the Nsp14/SIRT5
  complex could be primarily involved in mRNA cap methylation. Absence or inhibition
  of SIRT5 would lead to incomplete cap methylation and stronger immune recognition
  of viral mRNA. B-C. Data show mean and SEM between biological replicates. Asterisks
  summarize the results of one-way ANOVAs followed by Holm–Šidák multiple comparisons
  test (on log-transformed data for plaque assays). *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***:
  p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001.'
