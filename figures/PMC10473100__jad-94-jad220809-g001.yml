caption: 'Activated pathway of necroptosis. TNF signaling: Upon stimulation by TNFα,
  TNFR1 interacts with TNFR1 DD to recruit cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
  (cIAP), RIPK1, TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF), and TNF receptor-associated
  death domain (TRADD) to the intracellular portion of TNFR1 to form complex I and
  activation NF-κB. When the ubiquitination of RIPK1 in complex I is inhibited, RIPK1
  dissociates from the cell membrane and recruits TRADD, TRADD-FAS-associated DD protein
  (FADD) to form complex IIa that activates caspase-8, and leads to apoptosis. When
  caspase activity is insufficient, RIPK1 and RIPK3 interact through the RIP homology-interacting
  domain (RHIM) to form RIPK1-RIPK3 necrosomes and phosphorylate RIPK3 (complex IIb).
  This is followed by p-RIPK3 which can phosphorylate MLKL, facilitating its translocation
  to the plasma membrane where MLKL leads to cell lysis, resulting in Ca2 + influx,
  Na+, K+, and Mg2 + efflux, and DAMP release. IFN signaling: Binding of IFN-I to
  IFNAR1 further leads to PKR necrosome formation by activating the assembly of the
  ISGF3 complex, which phosphorylates MLKL to form RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL for necroptosis.
  TLR signaling: TLR3/4 are activated by their respective ligands, and TLRs can activate
  necroptosis by recruiting RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosomes by linking TRIF.'
