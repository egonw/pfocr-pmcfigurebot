caption: 'Experimental design and comparative analysis of immune index and intestinal
  microbiota after high exposure to pesticides(A) The population was divided into
  two groups: healthy group (n = 13) and high-pesticide exposure group (n = 47). Samples
  were collected and the data were analyzed.(B) Significant difference in immune factors
  between the healthy group and the high exposure to pesticides (p < 0.05), the average
  value of error line means ± SEM.(C) Shannon index, Simpson index in healthy group
  and high-exposure group, and based on the principal coordinate analysis of Bray-curtis,
  the different color points in the (PCoA) between healthy group and the high-exposure
  group represented the samples of different groups.(D) The species with significant
  changes between the healthy group and the high-exposure group (p < 0.05), the average
  error line means ± SEM.(E) Significant difference in metabolic pathway between the
  healthy group and the pesticide high-exposure group, and Log2 Fold Change represented
  a logarithmic change. The value <0 represented the related metabolic pathway of
  enrichment in the healthy group, and the value >0 represented the related metabolic
  pathway of enrichment in the high-pesticide exposure group.'
