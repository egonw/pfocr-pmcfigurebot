caption: 'RNA-seq analysis. (A) Heat map, (B) KEGG enrichment analysis, (C) enriched
  KEGG biological pathway, and (D) kay genes expression involved in lipid metabolic
  process, inflammation, and fibrosis were performed in the liver of DIO+CCl4-induced
  mice. (E) RT-PCR analysis and (F) Western blot analysis of CD36 expression were
  conducted in DIO+CCl4-induced mice. (G) RT-PCR analysis and (H) Western blot analysis
  of CD36 expression were conducted in CDA-diet-fed mice. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD, n = 8. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 compared with the normal control group; **
  p < 0.01 compared with the DIO+CCl4 group or CDA group.'
