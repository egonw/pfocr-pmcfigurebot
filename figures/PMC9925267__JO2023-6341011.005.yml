caption: STAT3 was the downstream target of miR-370-3p. (a) There were conservative
  binding sites between STAT3 and miR-370-3p. (b) Dual-luciferase reporter assay was
  used to detect the binding of MALAT1 to miR-370-3p. (c) RIP assay to detect the
  combination of STAT3 and miR-370-3p. (d) The level of STAT3 after regulation of
  miR-370-3p was detected by western blot. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. All
  experiments were performed at least three times.
