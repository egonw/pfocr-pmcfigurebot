caption: 'PACAP activates the PAC1-PKA-CREB signaling pathway to stimulate FAIM expression.
  (A) mRNA level of Faim in PA-induced AML12 treated with PACAP, determined by qRT-PCR
  (n = 3). (B) The effect of PACAP on the activation of PKA and CREB in PA induced
  AML12 cells, the protein levels of PKA, CREB and FAIM, and phosphorylation of PKA
  and CREB were determined by western blot. (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs.
  PA group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. PACAP (1 μM) group). (C) Schematic
  of the sequence of two CRE binding sites that CREB targets the WT or mutated promoter
  region of Faim mRNA. (D–F) Luciferase activities in AML12 transiently transfected
  with either wild type (WT), truncated, or mutant Faim promoter-luciferase reporter
  constructs. Then the cells were treated with PACAP (1 μM), or co-transfected with
  CREB cDNA or empty vectors. (G) Luciferase activities of FAIM WT reporter plasmids
  in AML12 cells with the treatment of KG-501 (a specific CREB inhibitor) and PACAP
  (1 μM) as indicated. Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 3 or 5 (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001).'
