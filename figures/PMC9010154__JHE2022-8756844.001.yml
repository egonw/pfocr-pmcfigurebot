caption: AIM2 is upregulated in gastric cancer. (∗P < 0.05, Data obtained from three
  independent are represented as means and standard errors.) (a) AIM2 expression in
  GC tumor (n = 375) and paracancerous normal control tissues (n = 32) was assessed.
  (b) AIM2 expression was quantified in pairs of GC tumors and control tissues. (c)
  Assessment of AIM2 ROC curve sensitivity and specificity. (d) Western blotting was
  used to assess AIM2 protein levels in matched tumor (T) and normal (N) tissue samples.
  AIM2 is upregulated in GC cell lines.
