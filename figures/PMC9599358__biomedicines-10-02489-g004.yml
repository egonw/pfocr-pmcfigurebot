caption: 'Role of the mevalonate pathway in sustaining mutp53 expression level and
  pancreatic cell survival. PaCa44 and PT45 cells were treated with cMyc inhibitor
  (i-cMyc) (50 μM) (A) or with Lovastatin (LOVA) (30 μM) (B) for 48 h to evaluate
  mevalonate kinase (MVK) or p53 expression by Western blot analyses. βActin was used
  as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The histograms represent
  the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of MVK/Act and p53/Act. p value:
  * <0.05; ** <0.01; *** <0.001; **** <0.0001; (C) cell survival of PaCa44 and PT45
  cells treated with LOVA (30 μM) for 48 h was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion
  assay. The histograms represent the mean plus SD of live cells as percent of untreated
  control cells, * p value: <0.05.'
