caption: 'XCH reduced the inflammatory response in viral pneumonia model mice induced
  by poly (I:C). (a) XCH treatment decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines
  in BALF. (b) Flow cytometry showed that XCH treatment decreased the ratio between
  CD86+ and CD206+ cells in BALF. (c) Flow cytometry showed that XCH treatment decreased
  the proportion of Ly6G+CD11b+ cells in BALF. (d) XCH treatment decreased the activity
  of MPO in lung tissue homogenate. ((e) and (f)) Western blot showed that XCH treatment
  inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. Control, model, positive
  control, XCH low-dose, and XCH high-dose groups (n = 10 per group). ##: p < 0.01
  compared with the control group; ∗: p < 0.05 compared with the model group; ∗∗:
  p < 0.01 compared with the model group.'
