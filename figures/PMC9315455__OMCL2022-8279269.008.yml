caption: PARP1 inhibition impaired the capacity of DNA repair and activated the Cyto
  c/Cas 3 pathway. (a–m) Western blot showed that expression of γH2AX was upregulated
  in the hair follicle in mice treated with BMN 673. There were no significant changes
  in the expression of PARP1 in mice treated with BMN 673, while the expression of
  PAR was downregulated. Expression of DNA damage repair proteins, p-ATM, p-BRCA 1,
  Rad51, KU80, and KU70, was decreased in mice treated with BMN 673. Translocation
  of AIF to the nucleus was blocked in the hair follicle, while expression of Cyto
  c was upregulated and Cas 3 was activated in mice treated with BMN 673. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
