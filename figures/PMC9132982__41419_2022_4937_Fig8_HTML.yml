figure_title: Proguanil-enhanced EGFR degradation to inhibit the growth of xenograft
  tumor in vivo
caption: A 107 T24 and shEGFR-2 T24 cell suspension were injected into the right and
  left axilla of mice in group 2 and group 3. When the tumor volume reached 70–100
  mm3, mice in group 3 were treated with proguanil. After treated 14 days, tumors
  were removed and photographed. B The tumor volume of each mouse was measured every
  two days, and the mean volume of each group tumor was calculated to create the figure.
  C Statistical analysis of tumor weight. D Ki-67 was used to analyze the proliferation
  of xenograft tumor. E The expression of EGFR in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry.
  F Changes of each group mice weight. G HE staining of liver and kidney organs of
  each group mice. All in vitro experiments are representative of three independent
  experiments. Error bars represent means ± SD. Vehicle control(2% PEG-400 + 2% Tween-80 + 96%
  PBS). (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns not significant).
