figure_title: BMI1 pathway and DNA damage response regulate several phenotypes of
  DM1 fibroblasts
caption: (A) Western blot of indicated proteins in control and DM1 fibroblasts infected
  with empty vector (–) or construct encoding BMI1 (BMI1). Representative immunoblots
  of 3 independent experiments are shown. (B) BMI1 mRNA levels in DM1 fibroblasts
  infected with empty vector or overexpressing BMI1 compared with control fibroblasts
  (n = 2 experiments with 2 independent biological samples each). (C) Cell growth
  of different genotypes at the indicated time points (n ≥ 5). (D) Quantification
  of pH3+ cells in the indicated genotypes (n = 4). (E) mRNA levels of p16INK4A, p14ARF,
  and p21CIP1 in DM1 (n = 3) and control fibroblasts (n = 2). (F) Quantification of
  SA–β-galactosidase+ cells in indicated genotypes. Results are average of 2 independent
  experiments with 2 independent samples each. (G) Quantification of γ-H2AX integrated
  fluorescence density at indicated genotypes in the absence or presence of doxorubicin
  (each point represents an independent sample; n ≥ 5). (H) Quantification of 53BP1
  integrated fluorescence density in controls and DM1 fibroblasts in the absence or
  presence of doxorubicin (each point represents an independent sample; n ≥ 5). (I)
  BRCA1 mRNA levels in DM1 and control fibroblasts infected with empty vector (pLKO,
  or –) or with a short hairpin (shBRCA1) (n = 2). Relative expression to pLKO condition
  in each genotype. (J) Cell growth of different genotypes at the indicated time points
  (n ≥ 2). (K) mRNA levels of p16INK4A in DM1 and control fibroblasts of the indicated
  genotypes (n ≥ 2). (L) Quantification of γ-H2AX integrated fluorescence density
  in controls and DM1 fibroblasts in the absence or presence of doxorubicin (n = 3).
  P values were calculated using the Student’s t test with P value corrected for FDR.
