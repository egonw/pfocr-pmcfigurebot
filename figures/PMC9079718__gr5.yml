caption: 'MG53 and hUC-MSCs transplantation synergically alleviates memory impairment
  and depression-like behavior in AD mice. (A) The swimming trajectory path of MWM.
  (B) The crossing times of mice in each group. (C) Time spent in target quadrant.
  (D) Total distance and (E) total rearings of mice in OFT. (F) Immobility time in
  FST. (G) Time to enter the center and (H) the total food consumption in NSF. N = 8
  per group. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. *: Compared with the AD group, P < 0.05;
  #: Compared with the MSCs group, P < 0.05.'
