caption: The mechanism of reversing drug resistance by promoting apoptosis of cancer
  cells. (A) Smac peptides are apoptosis peptides, the most widely studied is the
  Smac N-terminal tetrapeptide (AVPI), which has a strong binding force with the chain
  IAP, and the AVPI peptide and p53 DNA are co-delivered to induce apoptosis. (B)
  The synthesized amphiphilic β-peptide polymer is an ACP, which is composed of cationic
  and anionic residues. It can bind to the negative charge on the surface of cancer
  cells through electrostatic interaction, and then the hydrophobic part interacts
  with the phospholipid bilayer to destroy the cell membrane. (C) Mature human neutrophil
  peptide-1 first mediates the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in
  cells, decoupling the respiratory chain from oxidative phosphorylation, damaging
  the energy source of tumor cells, and leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. (D)
  The peptide aptamer All-7 can specifically bind to the ErbB2 receptor, interfere
  with the activation of the AKT pathway so it cannot regulate the nuclear transcription
  factor κB and FOXO-1 through the phosphorylation of AKT, and restore the sensitivity
  of tumor cells to paclitaxel. (E) As an inhibitor of the mechanism of action of
  SNCG protein, ANK peptide can bind to Synuclein-γ (SNCG) protein, prevent the interaction
  between SNCG protein and BubR1 mitotic checkpoint kinase, and the role of the mitotic
  checkpoint will return to normal.
