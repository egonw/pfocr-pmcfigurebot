caption: 'Knockdown of FOXM1 alleviated UV irradiation-mediated dysfunction of keratinocytes.
  (a) si-NC and si-FOXM1 were transfected into HaCaT cells and transfection efficiency
  was measured by RT-PCR after 24 hours. The transfected HaCaT cells were processed
  by UV irradiation and then treated with curcumin (5 μM) for 24 hours. (b) CCK-8
  was employed to examine the proliferation of UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. (c)–(e)
  The contents of SOD, GSH-PX, and MDA in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells were evaluated
  using the Oxidative Stress Assay Kit. (f) Cytofluorimetry was applied to assay the
  level of ROS in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. (g) The expression of inflammatory cytokines
  in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells was monitored by RT-PCR. (h) WB was adopted to verify
  the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. (i) WB
  gauged the expression of oxidative stress-related proteins in UV-irradiated HaCaT
  cells. (j) The profiles of inflammatory response proteins in UV-irradiated HaCaT
  cells were compared by WB. (k) WB assessed the SPAG5/FOXM1 pathway expression in
  UV-irradiated HaCaT cells. N = 3. ∗p < 0.05 (vs. si-NC or UV group), ∗∗p < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001; #p < 0.05 (vs. si-FOXM1+UV group), ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001.'
