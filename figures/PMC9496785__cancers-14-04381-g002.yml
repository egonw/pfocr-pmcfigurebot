caption: CRISPR generated loss of Foxp1 and Pten in the murine prostate. (A) AAV constructs
  for expression of sgRNAs to Pten or Pten and Foxp1 together with expression of Cre
  protein were generated. (B) Validation of the AAV particles were conducted in MEF
  isolated from Cas9-EGFPflox/flox mice. The expression of EGFP revealed viral transduction
  and Cre expression from the viral construct. Images were taken with 10× magnification
  (C) The efficiency of the sgRNA was determined with Sanger Sequencing and analysed
  with Synthego ICE software. (D) The AAV particles were delivered to the murine prostate
  with surgical injections and prostate tissues were examined 4 months post-treatment.
  White arrowheads mark transformed areas in the prostatic tissues (representative
  image, n = 5). (E) Paraffin sections from the prostates were stained for H & E (arrows
  mark PIN and arrowheads mark normal prostatic epithelial), p-Akt, Foxp1 and p63
  (brown stain) to confirm PIN formation and disruption to the Pten pathway and loss
  of Foxp1 in the Cas9-EGFP transgene mice (n = 5). Arrows mark cells depleted for
  Foxp1 and arrowheads mark cells positive for Foxp1 or p63. (F) Indel frequency was
  measured on EGFP-positive biopics from the anterior prostate lobe. Sanger Sequencing
  data were analysed with Synthego ICE software (n = 4–5).
