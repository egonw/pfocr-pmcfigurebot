caption: Model description and mRNA expression of LHX6 splice variants in cervical
  tissue. (A, B) Structures of LHX6 and its six annotated splice variants were depicted
  in the cartoon diagram. Boxes represent exons. The size of exons were indicated
  within the boxes. The location of arrows represented the position of specific primers
  designed. The exon 4 L indicated that this exon contained part length of exon 4
  (the contained length was 72 bp). (C, D) The detection rate of LHX6EX(+12) and LHX6EX(−12)
  group in cervical cancer tissues (T) and normal cervical samples (N). (E) Relative
  mRNA expression level of LHX6EX(+12) group in T and N. (F) Relative mRNA quantity
  of LHX6EX(−12) and LHX6EX(+12) group in T. The data were presented as median. n.s.
  indicated there was no significant statistical difference
article_title: The exon 12‐containing LHX6 isoforms promote cervical cancer cell proliferation
  by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.
