figure_title: Overexpression of septa-related gene, Smad7, recapitulates gene expression
  and morphology changes seen in Celsr3 cKO barrel cortex
caption: 'TGF-β family members display specific expression of receptors (a) and ligands
  (b) within the barrel thalamocortical pathway. c Inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, Smad7,
  is expressed in barrel cortex in a septa-related pattern. d Smad7 is upregulated
  in L4 of Celsr3cKO S1 cortex. e Smad7/EYFP overexpression (Smad7OE) leads to downregulation
  of hollow-related genes (Btbd3), and upregulation of septa-related genes (Nrxn2
  and Sorl1). Images are from a representative electroporated brain (P7) with RNA
  ISH for the indicated genes performed on serial sections. The extent of transfection
  is indicated by red arrowheads. Gene expression within electroporated areas (IUE)
  are outlined in green, while the un-electroporated barrel cortex (cont) is outlined
  in orange. f Quantification of expression changes in Smad7OE brains. Log2FoldChange
  was calculated for L4 expression intensity of indicated genes in the IUE vs Cont
  hemisphere. Displayed are group means ± SEM. Astn2: n = 3; Btbd3: n = 16; Cadps2:
  n = 4; Cdh8; n = 3; Nrxn2: n = 3; Sorl1: n = 3 brains. g Morphology of L4 Smad7OE
  neurons which were sparsely transfected with Cre-dependent Smad7/EYFP (LSL=LoxP-STOP-LoxP).
  A prominent apical dendrite (asterisk) was found on most Smad7OE neurons (arrowheads).
  In some images, arrows indicate the path of the apical dendrite. h Quantification
  of spiny stellate versus pyramidal neuron morphology in sparsely labeled Smad7OE
  neurons in L4, compared to control overexpression. Asterisks indicate ***p = 0.0002,
  generalized linear mixed-effects model with parametric bootstrap test (n = 158 neurons
  from 19 control brains, n = 62 neurons from 5 Smad7OE brains). Scale bars, 1 mm
  (yellow) and 100 µm (white). Source data are provided as a Source data file.'
