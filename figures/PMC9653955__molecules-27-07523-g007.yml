caption: Synergistic interactions between F5, F7, F5-SM or F7-SM with niraparib on
  HTB75 cell viability at 48 h (a–d) and F5 or F7 with niraparib on HTB161 cell viability
  at 48 h (e,f) following combined treatments. Synergy of cytotoxic activity was calculated,
  based on the Bliss independence drug interaction model. Control was vehicle control
  (1.50% v/v methanol + 0.90% v/v DMSO for HTB75 and 1.38% v/v methanol + 2.50% v/v
  DMSO for HTB161). Synergy was apparent when the experimental (observed) value of
  cell survival inhibition was higher than the calculated (expected) value. Delta
  values of observed minus expected are shown on the Y axis.  present the significantly
  different synergistic delta values of F5, F7, F5-SM or F7-SM with niraparib from
  all pair combinations according to the Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference
  test (n = 3; HSD; p ≤ 0.05).
