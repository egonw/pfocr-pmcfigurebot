caption: HFD‐fed bid −/−  mice have altered hepatic profiles of intermediate metabolites.
  Male WT and bid −/−  mice were on RD or HFD for 10 weeks with or without ABX treatment
  (Figure ). (A,B) The levels of certain sugar metabolites (A) or intermediate metabolites
  (B) in WT or bid −/−  livers following RD or HFD, with or without ABX treatment.
  (C) A simplified diagram of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) cycle showing the conversion
  of the relevant intermediate metabolites. (D) A working model of the interplay among
  the various factors that can affect diet‐induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.
  Black dots indicate unknown mechanisms by which BID, altered microbial, and possibly
  other factors could affect the host under HFD. It is possible that BID could modify
  the host response to altered microbial, leading to changes in metabolism of lipids
  and other intermediate metabolites, which ultimately affect the obesity phenotype.
  The pathway regulated by sex hormones, but not that by increased food uptake (leptin
  deficiency), may likely converge with that of BID. Data are shown as means ± SEM.
  Statistical analysis was performed by one‐way ANOVA followed by Duncan's post‐hoc
  test. Groups with asterisks had significant differences (p < 0.05). CoA, coenzyme
  A.
