caption: 'High NOD1 expression in tumour tissues promotes liver metastasis and poor
  prognosis in CRC patients. (a–c) Analysis of NOD1 expression in GEO dataset (ID:
  GSE41258). (a) normal colon tissues (n = 54) and primary tissues (n = 186); (b)
  normal liver tissues (n = 13) and metastatic liver tissues (n = 47); (c) primary
  tumour tissues (n = 186) and metastatic liver tissues (n = 47). (d and e) Relative
  NOD1 levels in tumour tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with CRC‐LM.
  (d) Primary tissue and adjacent normal colon tissues (n = 9); (e) metastatic liver
  tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues (n = 9). (f) NOD1 expression in primary
  tissue and adjacent normal colon tissues from non‐liver metastasis patients of CRC
  (CRC‐NLM) (n = 6). (g) Comparison of NOD1 mRNA level in tumour tissues from CRC‐NLMs
  and primary tumour tissues from CRC‐LMs. (h) Representative fluorescent images of
  NOD1 and macrophage staining in tumour and normal tissues from CRC‐LM. NOD1, green;
  F4/80, red; DAPI, blue. Red arrow, macrophages; white arrow, tumour tissues. Scale
  bar, 500 μm, and 50 μm. (i and j) Relationship between overall survival of CRC patients
  and NOD1 expression in tumour‐adjacent tissues (p < 0.001, Kaplan–Meier test), (i)
  data from GEO dataset (ID: GSE41258); (j) data from TCGA. In (d)–(f), the CT values
  of NOD1 were normalised to the average CT value from four reference genes (COPE,
  C1orf43, ENSA and GAPDH). The p‐value in (a) to (g) was calculated using the nonparametric
  Mann–Whitney test. mean; error bar, S.E.M. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001'
