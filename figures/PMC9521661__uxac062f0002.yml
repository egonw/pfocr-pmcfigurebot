caption: Baicalein facilitates ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux. (A–D)
  THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were exposed to PBS or 100 μM baicalein for
  24 h. (A) The mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 were determined by qRT-PCR
  and western blot, respectively. (B) Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and HDL was analyzed
  by the liquid scintillation counting method. (C) Detection of CD36 and SR-A expression
  using qRT-PCR and western blot. (D) Representative fluorescent images of Dil-ox-LDL
  uptake. The magnification of each panel is 200×. All data are presented as the mean
  ± SD from three independent experiments. **P < 0.01 vs. control group.
article_title: Baicalein inhibits macrophage lipid accumulation and inflammatory response
  by activating the PPARγ/LXRα pathway.
