caption: Quantification of the deformation of yeast cells during polar growth(A) A
  simple diagram of cell shapes with circle filling patterns. The image on the left
  depicts a yeast cell cultured for 1,020 min in a medium containing 0.7 μM pheromone;
  the red line indicates the contour of the cell; the image on the right is the filling
  model for the image on the left;  are the radii of the circle.(B) Real-time trajectory
  of the cell morphology (Hn) at 0.7 μM under non-equilibrium steady state. F1–F4
  indicate the four distinct cell morphological fates. The horizontal dashed lines
  mark the approximate centers of the fates. Arrows highlight spontaneous state switching
  events between fates F3 to F2 (green) and F2 to F4 (red). The inset shows a magnified
  view of the trajectory over time points t1–t5. Cell morphologies during the initial
  non-equilibrium non-steady-state period before 600 min are omitted.(C) The distribution
  statistics of the cell growth rate at 0.7 μM. The red dashed line serves as the
  dividing line between positive and negative data. WF and LS represent the lateral-fast
  and lateral-slow rates, respectively; LF and WS represent the longitudinal-fast
  and longitudinal-slow rates, respectively.(D) Schematic illustration of the molecular
  mechanism underlying the formation of the four growth rates. Model W indicates that
  the polar growth pathway P1 is not yet connected, so only the P2pathway operates;
  Model L depicts the cooperative operation of polar growth pathways P1 and P2. Models
  F and S describe the polar growth patterns of the two growth forces, which correspond
  to the high and low states of Fus3, respectively.(E) Dual fluorescent protein system
  in yeast. The three images on the left, from top to bottom, depict bright field
  cells, cells excited at 488 nm, and cells excited at 561 nm. The white circle within
  the cell represents the nucleus boundary; S65T and yomCherry are the fluorescent
  proteins that were linked to CDC24 and FUS3, respectively.(F) Cross-correlation
  of two levels of gene expression at distinct positions. Gene_in and gene_out represent
  the gene expression levels inside and outside the nucleus, respectively. The red
  curve represents the cross-correlation between Fus3_in and Cdc24_in/out, while the
  blue curve corresponds to the cross-correlation between Fus3_out and Cdc24_in/out.(G)
  Statistical graph of the distribution statistics of the absolute value of the cell
  growth rate at 0.7 μM.(H) The proportion of high-state and low-state data present
  in high and low states at various pheromone concentrations.
