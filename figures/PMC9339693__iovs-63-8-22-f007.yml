caption: 'High glucose reduces Cx43 expression and GJIC activity through RhoA/ROCK1/pMLC
  signaling. (A) Immunofluorescence staining of Cx43 (green) and DAPI staining (blue)
  in mRMVECs. Cx43 was distributed mainly in the membrane of mRMVECs (arrows) in the
  normal glucose group or ROCK inhibitor group. Cx43 distribution decreased in the
  cell membrane and it was translocated to the cytoplasm (asterisks) in the high glucose
  group or RhoA over expression plasmid group. (B, C) GJIC function was evaluated
  by counting cell layers stained with Lucifer Yellow CH dye. Scale bar: 100 µm. EV,
  empty vector. ns, no significance. ****P < 0.0001 compared with the control group;
  ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.001 compared with the high glucose (30 mM) group. N = 3.
  The bars are the mean ± SD.'
