caption: 'The proposed relationship between ageing, gut dysbiosis, and hearing loss.
  Numbers in arrows indicate a pathway described below. Abbreviations: LPS—lipopolysaccharides;
  ROS—reactive oxygen species; NF-κB—nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells; TLR—toll-like receptor; NLRP3—Nod-Like Receptor Pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3. Ageing is associated with developing gut dysbiosis, and it was proposed
  that dysbiosis is an underlying cause of age-related morbidities (1) [,]. As humans
  age, inflammaging results from the activation of NF-κB signalling pathways (2) [].
  In addition, the leaky intestinal barrier causes the release of bacterial metabolites
  into the bloodstream, systemic inflammation, activation of NF-κB (4), and ROS overproduction
  (32) [,,]. Activation of NF-κB may result in reduced insulin signalling (26) [,],
  which can lead to sterile cochlear inflammation (25) [,], and priming of NLRP3 (15)
  [,,]. Ageing (8) and gut dysbiosis (3) are both associated with dyslipidemia [,,,,].
  Dyslipidemia can lead to the narrowing of cochlear blood vessels (13) [,,] and lipid
  raft formation (9) [,,]. Lipid rafts lead to the accumulation of ROS (10) [] and
  oxidative stress (OS) (11) [,]. OS can activate the NF-κB pathway (24) [,] and cause
  cochlear damage and hearing loss (12) [,,,,,,]. The cholesterol and lipids obstructing
  cochlear vessels lead to cochlear ischemia (14), which also contributes to cochlear
  damage (15) [,,,,,]. Insulin resistance can lead to an electrochemical imbalance
  in endolymph by decreasing the expression of the sodium-potassium pump NKCC1, reducing
  the endocochlear potential [,,]. Insulin resistance also decreases nitric oxide
  production (27) [,] resulting in impaired blood flow regulation (28) [,], cochlear
  ischemia (29) and eventually hearing loss (15) [,]. Gut dysbiosis can lead to increased
  levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5) [,,,,,]. LPS is a bacterial metabolite
  that can activate NF-κB via toll-like receptors (TLRs) (7) [,]. LPS also affects
  insulin signalling (23) [,] and contributes to NLRP3 inflammasome activation [].
  After priming via the NF-κB signalling pathway (15), NLRP3 is activated via ROS
  (30), resulting in NLRP3 inflammasomes (17). NLRP3 inflammasomes can cause pyroptosis
  (19) [], which also produces cochlear damage [] (21). NLRP3 can also initiate the
  activation of cochlear macrophages (18) [], which can increase the BLB permeability
  and induce sterile cochlear inflammation (20) [,,], leading to hearing loss (22)
  [,].'
