caption: 'ERK1/2-mediated signaling is involved in norketamine (NK)-induced apoptosis
  and ER stress in RT4 cells. Cells were treated with NK (0.2 mM) for 24 h in the
  absence or presence of the pharmacological inhibitor of JNK (SP600125; 20 μM), ERK1/2
  (PD98059; 20 μM), or p38 (SB203580; 20 μM), and then (A) cell viability was determined
  using MTT assay, and (B) caspase-3 activity was detected using the caspase-3 Activity
  Assay Kit. Furthermore, RT4 cells were treated with NK (0.2 mM) for 1 or 24 h in
  the absence or presence of the specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 (PD98059; 20 μM; for
  1 h prior to treated with NK). The levels of protein expression for GRP78, CHOP,
  XBP-1s, ATF-4, caspase-3, -7, and -12, and PARP (C), the release of cytochrome c
  from the mitochondria into cytosolic fraction (D), and the protein phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 (F) were examined using Western blot analysis, and (E) MMP depolarization
  was measured using flow cytometry. Data in (A,B,E) are presented as the means ±
  SD of four independent experiments assayed in triplicate. Results shown in (C,D,F)
  on representative images, and quantification was determined by densitometric analysis.
  Each bar presented is the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05
  compared to vehicle control. # p < 0.05 compared to NK treatment alone.'
