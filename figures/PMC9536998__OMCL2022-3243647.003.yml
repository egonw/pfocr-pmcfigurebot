caption: '(a) Lasso regression analysis of DEGs between the normal and the DM groups.
  (b) ROS level of BxPC-3 cell lines under different glucose levels (HG: high glucose
  level group, MG: medium glucose level group, LG: low glucose level group). (c) Cell
  viability of BxPc-3 treated with 10 μmol/L gemcitabine for 24 h and 48 h. (d) Pancreatic
  cancer cell lines were treated with 10 μmol/L gemcitabine for 24 h under different
  glucose levels. (e) The apoptosis rate of different glucose groups under 10 μmol/L
  gemcitabine for 24 h (the lower right is the bar graph concluding the apoptosis
  between three groups). (f) Wound healing test of different glucose levels.'
