caption: 'NRG1 is downregulated in PE placental tissue and upregulated in trophoblasts
  in response to CV-MSCs. (A) Placental tissue samples from PE patients and healthy
  controls were subject to staining to detect NRG1 expression. (B) NRG1 mRNA expression
  was analyzed in placental tissue samples from PE patients and healthy controls via
  qPCR. (C, D) NRG1 expression was compared in trophoblasts that had or had not been
  treated with CV-MSCs at the mRNA (C) and protein (D) levels by qPCR and Western
  immunoblotting, respectively. GAPDH served as a normalization control. Student''s
  t-test: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
article_title: Chorionic villus-derived mesenchymal stem cell-mediated NRG1 upregulation
  promotes HTR-8/SVneo cells proliferation through the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
