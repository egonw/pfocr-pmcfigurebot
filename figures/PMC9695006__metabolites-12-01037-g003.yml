caption: Exosome metabolite profiling. Purified exosomes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
  (A) HCA showed the clustered m/z features of exosomes in SH003, DTX, and combination
  groups. (B) PCA score plots showing the variation of clusters based on measured
  metabolites. (C) The pathway on significant metabolites identified after combined
  SH003 and DTX treatment was mapped from the KEGG database. Enrichment statistics
  and topology analysis of pathways were performed by MetaboAnalyst 5.0.
