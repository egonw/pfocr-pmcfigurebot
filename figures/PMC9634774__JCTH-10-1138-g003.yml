figure_title: Imbalance of Th17 and Treg cells proportion in liver induced by IR-stress
caption: (A) mRNA levels of IL17A, IL17Ra, and Foxp3 in human (i) and mouse (ii) liver
  after IR-stress. (B) Western blots of IL17A in human (i) and mouse (ii) liver. (C)
  Flow cytometry of lymphocyte phenotype transition. The proportion of CD4+ IL17A+
  Th17 cells in peripheral blood (i) and liver (ii) increased; that of CD4+ CD25+
  Foxp3+ Treg cells decreased. (D) mRNA levels of IL17A, IL17Ra, and Foxp3 in human
  peripheral blood and mouse liver lymphocytes. Data are means ± SEM, *p <0.05, Student’s
  t-test. IL17A, interleukin-17A; IL17Ra, interleukin 17 receptor alpha; Foxp3, transcription
  factor forkhead box P3; Th17, T helper type 17; Treg, regulatory T.
