figure_title: Downregulation of HM13 suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer
  in vitro and in vivo
caption: A, B The transfection efficiencies of si-HM13-1 and si-HM13-2 were evaluated
  by qRT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) in SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines. C The CCK-8
  assays were performed to measure the cell viability of SUM1315 (left) and ZR-75-1
  (right) cell lines transfected with siRNAs. D Representative results of the colony
  formation showed the cell proliferation in SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines after
  downregulation of HM13. E, F EdU assays were conducted to compare the growth rates
  in SUM1315 (E) and ZR-75-1 (F) cell lines between experimental groups (si-HM13-1
  and si-HM13-2) and control group (si-NC). DAPI was indicated by blue, EdU was indicated
  by red. Scale bars, 50 μm. G Images of xenograft tumors from nude mice classified
  into HM13 knockdown (sh-HM13) group and control (sh-NC) group (n = 6). H, I Average
  tumor volume (H) and tumor weight (I) of breast cancer in knockdown of HM13 (sh-HM13)
  and control (sh-NC) group were shown by tumor growth curves. J IHC staining of breast
  cancer tissues from tumor subcutaneous mice model was aimed to determine the positive
  rates of HM13 and Ki-67 in knockdown of HM13 (sh-HM13) and control (sh-NC) group.
  Scale bars, 100 µm. Data were shown as mean ± SD, (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
