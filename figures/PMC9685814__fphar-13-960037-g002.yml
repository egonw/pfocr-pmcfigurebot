caption: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as a neurodegenerative disease, is the most common
  form of dementia. Common Indian spices such as cardamom, black pepper, fenugreek,
  fennel, coriander, and cumin all have neuroprotective effects in AD through inhibition
  of amyloid (Aβ) plaques formation, inflammation, and NF-κB pathway, MAO formation,
  H2O2 and ROS formation, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase
  (AChE) activity. These components can also induce NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor
  function, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and Nrf2 and BDNF transcription.
