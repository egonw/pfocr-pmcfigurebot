caption: An overview of the analyses in this study. In total, 1325 genes were selected
  through a Pearson correlation test of S:E fusion-positive prostate cancer compared
  with ERG fusion-negative prostate cancer, and 2829 genes were selected through a
  Pearson correlation test of T:E fusion-positive prostate cancer compared with ERG
  fusion-negative prostate cancer. The selected genes were used for pathway analysis
  using ORA via CPDB, and for geneâ€“drug network analysis via Cytoscape.
