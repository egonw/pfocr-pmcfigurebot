caption: circBRWD1 is significantly downregulated in the malignant transformed cell
  model and lung cancer cell lines(A and B) The viability of BEAS-2B cells treated
  with different concentrations of arsenic poison; the exposure times were tested
  by CCK-8 assay. (C and D) The ability of BEAS-2B cells exposed to arsenic and control
  BEAS-2B cells to grow on soft agar was observed under a microscope. (E) Volcano
  map showing the differential expression levels of circRNAs. (F) The Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) website was used to conduct a pathway enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed circRNAs. (G) The 10 most differentially expressed circRNAs
  in the expression profiles were verified by qPCR according to their expression levels
  in BEAS-2B cells and BEAS-2B-As cells. (H) circBRWD1 expression levels in BEAS-2B
  cells exposed to arsenic were detected by qPCR on the basis of cell generation P0,
  P10, P20, P30, and P40. (I) Compared with that in BEAS-2B cells, the expression
  of circBRWD1 in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H1975, H226, and H460 cell
  lines) was separately detected by qPCR. (J) The expression of pre-BRWD1 and BRWD1
  mRNA in BEAS-2B cells and BEAS-2B-As cells was verified by qPCR. (K) After convergent
  and divergent primers were designed for PCR-agarose gel electrophoresis, the circular
  structure of circBRWD1 was confirmed. (L) Schematic structure of circBRWD1. An asterisk
  (∗) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05).
