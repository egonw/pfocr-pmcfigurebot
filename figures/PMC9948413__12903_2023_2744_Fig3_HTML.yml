caption: Interfering with ALKBH5 or FTO can promote HSV-1-induced expression of type
  I interferon. A Knockdown of ALKBH5 and FTO using siRNA in HIOEC cells. B Knockdown
  of ALKBH5 and FTO increased m6A modification of RNA in HIOEC cells. C Knockdown
  of ALKBH5 and FTO activated the STING signaling pathway in HIOEC cells. D Knockdown
  of ALKBH5 and FTO increased mRNA expression levels of IFNα, IFNβ, ISG15 and CXCL10
  in HIOEC cells. **P < 0.01
