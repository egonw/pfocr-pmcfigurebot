caption: The comparisons of somatic mutation and pathway alteration characteristics
  between colorectal cancer patients with different tumor sizes and ages. (A) The
  bar plots comparing gene alteration rates in early-onset (N=34) and late-onset patients
  (N=99). (B) The bar plots comparing pathway alteration rates in early-onset (N=34)
  and late-onset patients (N=99). (C) The bar plots comparing gene alteration rates
  patients with small tumor size (tumor diameter smaller than 5cm, N=76) and large
  tumor size (tumor diameter equal or larger than 5cm, N=53). (D) The bar plots comparing
  pathway alteration rates patients with small tumor size (tumor diameter smaller
  than 5cm, N=76) and large tumor size (tumor diameter equal or larger than 5cm, N=53).
