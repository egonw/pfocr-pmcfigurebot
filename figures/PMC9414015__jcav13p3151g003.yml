caption: Lycorine induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in DU145 and PC3 cells. (A)
  We analyzed cell cycle distribution of DU145 Cells using PI staining. Cells were
  harvested for cell cycle distribution analysis using presidium iodide staining 24
  hours after treatment with lycorine at the concentration as indicated. (B) We analyzed
  cell cycle distribution of PC3 Cells using PI staining. After treatment with lycorine
  for 24 h, the cells were harvested for cell cycle distribution analysis using presidium
  iodide staining. (C) The expression of cell cycle inhibitory protein p21 and cyclinD1
  was detected by western blot in DU145 Cells. (D) The expression of cell cycle inhibitory
  protein p21 and cyclinD1 was detected by western blot in PC3 Cells.
