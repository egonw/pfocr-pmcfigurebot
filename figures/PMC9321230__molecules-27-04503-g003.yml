caption: Compound 1 activates MAPK signaling, and compound 2 activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Colon carcinoma cells were treated with Rev-5901 analogs 1 and 2 for indicated
  time points, and the expression was analyzed by Western blot. Densitometry analysis
  is presented as a fold change relative to control. One representative experiment
  out of three is shown.
