figure_title: A novel gain-of-function IFITM3 mutant induces secretory pathway defects
  that affect glycoproteins trafficking
caption: (A) Genomic structure of IFITM3 with a highlight on amino acids of the cytoplasmic
  intracellular loop. In mutant 85-90, red residues have been mutated to alanine.
  (B) Schematic representation of HIV-1 virion assembly. PM stands for plasma membrane.
  (C) HEK293T cells were transfected with DNAs coding for the HIV-1 proviral clone
  NL4-3 along with control, WT or 85-90 mutant IFITM3. Cells were lysed 48 h after
  transfection, whereas virion particles released in the supernatant were first purified
  by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion. Both cellular and viral lysates
  were analyzed by WB. (D) HEK293T cells were ectopically transfected with DNAs coding
  for the indicated IFITM3s along with the G protein of the Vesicular Stomatitis virus
  fused to the mEmerald fluorescent reporter (mEm.-VSV-G), before confocal microscopy
  analysis 24 h later. Representative confocal microscopy images and graph presenting
  the proportion of double-positive cells displaying perinuclear accumulation of mEm.-VSV-G
  (binary scoring; three independent experiments; between 50 and 100 cells scored
  per sample). *P-value < 0.0001 following a one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test; non-statistically significant differences, not shown. (E) Lysates obtained
  from cells expressing VSV-G along with control, WT and mutant IFITM3 were either
  untreated or treated with EndoH or PNGaseF before WB and densitometry quantification
  of the EndoH-sensitive and -resistant VSV-G forms. The scheme presents a simplified
  view of the trafficking and the modifications of glycoproteins during their transit
  through the ER–Golgi system. As EndoH is able to digest simple oligosaccharides
  added by enzymes resident in the ER and cis-Golgi, but not complex ones added later
  in the medial/trans Golgi compartment, differential susceptibility to EndoH provides
  a robust biochemical method to assess glycoproteins progression through the ER–Golgi.
  Panels present representative results, whereas the graph presents the proportions
  of EndoH-sensitive and -resistant VSV-G obtained in five independent experiments.
  *P-value of 0.0021 following a one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test
  over control. Uncropped blots and source data are provided in the relevant section.Source
  data are available for this figure.
