caption: Analysis of differentially methylated locations (DMPs) for functional enrichment.
  (a) DMPs have enhanced Gene Ontology (GO) items in the categories of biological
  process (BP), molecular function (MF), and cell component (CC). Each category's
  top ten items were shown. (b) The intersection of differentially expressed loci
  is shown using a Venn diagram. (c) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway of DMPs. Cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic
  information processing, human diseases, metabolism, and organismal systems are all
  subdivided into this section. The findings of the enrichment analysis for KEGG are
  shown in . The top twenty items from each category were shown.
