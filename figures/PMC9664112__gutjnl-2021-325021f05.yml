caption: Cigarette smoke enhances the expression of oncogenic MAPK/ERK pathway and
  proinflammatory pathway in colonic epithelium. (A) Differential expressed genes
  of colonic epithelium in the AOM+Smoking group compared with the AOM group by Mouse
  Cancer Pathway Finder PCR Array analysis (FC=AOM+Smoking/AOM, positive log2(FC)=higher
  expression in AOM+Smoking group and negative log2(FC)=higher expression in AOM group).
  FC between AOM+Smoking and AOM >2 was included. (B) The altered cancer signalling
  pathways in the AOM+Smoking group compared with AOM group by enrichment analysis.
  Enrichment scores >1 were included. The arrows represent the direction of enrichment,
  calculated by comparing the upregulated and downregulated genes in the pathway.
  The differentially expressed genes in MAPK signalling pathway were shown in network.
  (C) Protein expression of ρ-ERK1/2 in the colon of the AOM-treated mice by western
  blot. (D) Differential expressed genes of colonic epithelium in the AOM+Smoking
  mice compared with AOM mice by Mouse Inflammatory Response and Autoimmunity Array
  analysis. (E) The altered inflammatory signalling pathways in the AOM+Smoking group
  compared with AOM group by enrichment analysis. Enrichment score >1 were included.
  The differentially expressed genes in TNF and IL-17 signalling pathways were shown
  in network. (F) Gene expression of Cxcl2, Il-17a and Il-10 by quantitative RT-PCR.
  Data are expressed as mean±SD. **p<0.01, *p<0.05; statistical significance was determined
  by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test. p values were adjusted by FDR (). AOM, azoxymethane;
  ERK, extracellular signal‑regulated protein kinase; FC, fold change; Il, interleukin;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; TNF,
  tumour necrosis factor.
