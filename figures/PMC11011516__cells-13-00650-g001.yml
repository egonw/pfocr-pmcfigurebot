caption: Lys deficiency inhibits fast (semimembranosus) and slow (semitendinosus)
  muscle growth in weaned piglets. Mass of fast (a) and slow muscle (b) in piglets
  weaned on day 15 of the study; mass of fast (c) and slow muscle (d) in piglets weaned
  on day 29 of the trial, n = 6, * indicates p < 0.05, same below.
