caption: 'LYC promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activated downstream antioxidant
  signaling pathways to alleviate AAI-induced oxidative stress injury in NRK52E cells.
  A–C: Western-blot and RT-PCR detected the expression of HO-1, NQO1, Keap-1, Nuclear-Nrf2,
  and Nrf2. Elisa detected the intracellular SOD and GSH-PX expression. D: Immunofluorescence
  detected the expression of Nrf2 in the cells and the positive expression areas were
  quantified. "Yellow arrows" in the figure indicated the phenomenon of Nrf2 nuclear
  translocation. E: In vitro DCFH-DA staining was performed on NRK52E cells after
  drug treatment to detect the content of intracellular ROS and quantitative analysis
  of fluorescence intensity. F: Schematic representation of Nrf2 signaling pathway
  mechanism. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
