caption: Slc7a8 and Slc6a19 influence the D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism pathways
  by reducing the influx of glutamine into cells (Slc7a8, solute carrier membrane
  transport protein, family 7, subfamily A, member 8, large neutral amino acids transporter,
  Slc6a19, solute carrier membrane transport protein, family 6, subfamily A, member
  19, sodium-dependent neutral amino acids transporter). (A) KEGG analysis of significantly
  downregulated genes showed protein digestion and absorption pathway enrichment.
  (B) Association analysis of genes in the protein digestion and absorption pathway
  with products involved in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. Slc7a8 and Slc6a19
  encode proteins that mediate transmembrane import of glutamine that are significantly
  associated with metabolites. (C) Scheme of metabolism in KO cells. Spearmanâ€™s test
  was used for correlation calculation, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 (PI3K, phosphorinositide
  3-kinaseS, cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, PKG, protein kinase G, GSH, glutathione,
  ADP, adenosine diphosphate, UMP, uridine monophosphate, UDP, uridine diphosphate,
  and mention the meanings of col, collagen, mep, 2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate,
  mme, membrane metalloendopeptidase, ATP, adenosine triphosphate).
