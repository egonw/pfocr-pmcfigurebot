caption: Pathway analyses of differentially expressed transcripts identified in endometrioid
  endometrial cancer (EEC) patients classified by high versus low metastatic risk.
  Data reflect the top twenty-five significant canonical pathways (–log p-value ≥
  2.0, ) enriched among significant differentially expressed transcripts () identified
  in RNA-seq data from endometrioid endometrial cancer patients in the Training-1
  cohort classified by high (Q4, n = 19) versus low (Q1, n = 19) metastatic risk ().
