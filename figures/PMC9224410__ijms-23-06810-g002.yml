caption: Inflammatory pathways were enriched in the mouse liver of the METH-treated
  group compared to the control by RNA-Seq analysis. (A) Principal component analysis;
  (B) Identification of DEGs using the histogram and scatter plot methods (|log2FC|
  â‰¥ 1, p-value < 0.05) in METH-treated wild-type (WT) group; (C) KEGG functional annotation
  analysis for metabolic pathways; (D) KEGG enrichment analysis in METH-treated WT
  mice. Inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, the Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway and the TNF signaling pathway (in the red boxes) were enriched and correlated
  with the inflammatory process.
