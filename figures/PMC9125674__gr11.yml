caption: 'Effects of rapamycin treatment on protein synthesis rate, phosphorylation
  of mTOR and protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K), protein levels of atrogin-1 and muscle
  RING finger 1 (MuRF1) in myoblasts from chicken embryo pectoralis major (PM) and
  biceps femoris (BF) muscle. Myoblasts from PM: (A) nitrite (NO2−) concentrations;
  (B) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS)
  activities in myoblasts; (C) the relative mRNA expression of iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS;
  (D) the protein synthesis rate; (E) the total and phosphorylated mTOR; (F) the total
  and phosphorylated p70S6K; (G) atrogin-1; (H) MuRF1. Myoblasts from BF: (I) NO2−
  concentrations; (J) iNOS and TNOS activities in myoblasts; (K) the relative mRNA
  expression of iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS; (L) the protein synthesis rate; (M) the total
  and phosphorylated mTOR; (N) the total and phosphorylated p70S6K; (O) atrogin-1;
  (P) MuRF1. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6); ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.'
