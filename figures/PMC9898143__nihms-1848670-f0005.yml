figure_title: DOT1L regulates stemness of CSCs by upregulating β-catenin
caption: A, Top 5 enriched pathways identified by MetaCore analysis of differentially
  expressed genes measured by RNA-seq in shDOT1L vs. shCtrl transduced OVCAR5 cells
  (n = 2). B, Dependency and ranks of KEGG Wnt canonical signaling pathway (hsa04310)
  genes as they related to DOT1L in OC cell lines profiled in CCLE. C, Heat map shows
  expression of genes in the KEGG Wnt canonical signaling pathway based on RNA-seq
  analysis of shDOT1L and shCtrl OVCAR5 cells. D, A scatter plot shows the correlation
  between expression levels of CTNNB1 and DOT1L in OC samples from TCGA (n = 427).
  E, mRNA expression levels of CTNNB1 in shDOT1L and shCtrl cells (n = 3) OC cell
  lines (OVCAR5, COV362) measured by qRT-PCR. F, Western blot analysis of Wnt pathway
  proteins (β-Catenin, Cyclin D1) and stem cell marker ALDH1A1 in shDOT1L vs shCtrl
  transduced OC cells (left) and in cells overexpressing DOT1L (DOT1L-OE) vs control
  (EV) (right). G, mRNA expression levels of CTNNB1, CCND1, and ALDH1A1 in OVCAR5
  cells treated with 1μM DOT1Li (n = 3). Data are shown as means ± SD of biological
  replicates. *, ** and *** depict P <0.05, P< 0.01 and P< 0.005 respectively.
