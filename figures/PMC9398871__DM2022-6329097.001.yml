caption: circCNN2 is highly expressed in LUSC cells. (a) RT-qPCR was used to examine
  the expression of circCNN2 in LUSC cell lines (SK-MES-1, H1703, H226, and H520)
  and the normal human bronchial epithelial Beas-2B cell line. (b) The specific convergent
  and divergent primers were, respectively, designed to amplify circCNN2, and gel
  electrophoresis with RT-qPCR was conducted to verify the loop structure of circCNN2.
  (c, d) RNase R and Actinomycin D (Act D) was used to treat H1703 and H226 cells
  and RT-qPCR was used to examine the expression of circCNN2 and CNN2. (e) FISH assay
  was carried out to identify the localization of circCNN2 in LUSC cells. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01 compared to the control group.
