figure_title: PTMSigDB reveals common pTyr signatures of cardiac proteome in HCM
caption: 'a Unsupervised PCA of the full cardiac Proteome of Non-transgenic, TgErbB2,
  and R403Q-αMyHC mice show distinct segregation of the experimental groups. The groups
  segregate along with the first principal component (PC #1), which accounts for 46%
  of the total correlation in the expression of Full Proteome (normalized, mean = 0,
  variance = 1). b Unsupervised PCA of the pTyrosine peptides signal normalized to
  full proteome expression. The groups also segregate along with the first principal
  component (PC #1), accounting for 52.2% of the total correlation. c A heatmap was
  used to visualize the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of pTyrosine peptides
  normalized to full proteome expression with a p-value < 0.05 by ANOVA. Overrepresented
  (yellow) and underrepresented (Blue). d Volcano plot showing the Log2 fold-change
  and –Log10 p-value of each pTyr peptide in the pairwise comparison of Ntg and TgErbB2.
  The data points highlighted in red show a significantly lower intensity, whereas
  the data in green show significantly higher intensity. The significant sites were
  magnified in the figure (dotted squares) to label some peptide sites. Magenta data
  points match genes significantly associated with MsigDB disease pathways. Cyan data
  point did not reach statistical significance although point to EGFR1 pathway. e
  Volcano plot showing the Log2 fold-change and –Log10 p-value of each pTyr peptide
  in the pairwise comparison of Ntg and R403Q-αMyHC. Red and green data points were
  color-coded as above. With a similar magnification as above, cyan data points show
  a significant association to EGFR1 Pathway by PTMsigDB. f Molecular Signature DB
  (MSigDB) and Molecular PTMs Signature DB (PTMsigDB) of Global pTyr data identified
  pathways that were significantly altered.'
