caption: 'HMM promotes the reabsorption of lumbar disc herniation by promoting extracellular
  matrix degradation. (a) The protein expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-13,
  and ADAMTS-4 were detected using western blotting. (b–f) Semiquantitative analysis
  of western blotting. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. the normal group;
  ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 vs. the LDH group; and ΔΔP < 0.01 and ΔΔΔP < 0.001 vs.
  the HMM group.'
