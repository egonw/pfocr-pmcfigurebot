caption: 'Effect of YPG on the expression of pyroptosis factor in BA rats. (a) mRNA
  levels of NLRP3, GSDMD, and GSDME were determined by real-time quantitative PCR.
  (b) The change in NLRP3, GSDMD, and GSDME protein expression was observed by western
  blotting. Notes: ##P < 0.01 compared with the normal group; ∗∗P < 0.01 compared
  with the model group.'
