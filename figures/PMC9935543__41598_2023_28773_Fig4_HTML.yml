caption: The crude extract of EL001672 and 1′-O-methyl-averantin block the sonic Hedgehog
  (SHH) signaling pathway. (A,D) Expression of mRNA encoding Gli1, Gli2, SMO, and
  Bmi-1 by CSC221 cells after treatment with the indicated concentrations of crude
  extract or 1′-O-methyl-averantin and incubated 48 h. (B–E) Western blot analysis
  of Gli1, Gli2, SMO, and Bmi-1 protein levels in CSC221 cells treated with indicated
  concentrations of crude extract and 1′-O-methyl-averantin and incubated 48 h. (C–F)
  Quantitative analysis of protein expression. 10, 5 and 2.5 µg/ml 1′-O-methyl averantin
  represent a concentration of 25.90, 12.95 and 6.47 µM, respectively. Data represent
  the mean ± standard error of the mean, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; difference
  compared with DMSO-treated.
