caption: Opsin and disk membrane swelling caused by chromophore isomerization, hydrolysis,
  and conversion to at-ROL may account for component 2 of the COS elongation response.
  (A) State space and flow schematic of reactions governing deactivation of photoisomerized
  cone pigment (photoactivated cone pigment [P*] = Meta II cone opsin) and production
  of at-ROL. At the high bleach levels that give rise to component 2, phosphorylation
  of P* by GRKs (including [G-protein receptor kinase] GRK1 and GRK7) is predictably
  saturated, and binding to PnPi of arrestin (ARR) (including ARR1 and ARR7) is limited
  by the relatively small amount of ARR in the dark-adapted COS, so that hydrolysis
  of all-trans retinal chromophore becomes the dominant pathway of P* deactivation
  (). RDH (RDH8 and possibly, other RDHs) is hypothesized to form a transient complex
  with P* to which hydrolyzed at-RAL may be weakly bound () and catalyzes the reduction
  of at-RAL to at-ROL with cofactor NADPH. (The phosphatase [P’ase] reaction, included
  for completeness, is unlikely to be material on the timescale of the experiments
  [i.e., a few seconds].) (B) Molecular structures of two key states in the scheme
  of A. (B, Left) GK1 bound to P* (). (B, Right) Lipid-anchored RDH8 associates transiently
  with unliganded cone opsin (Pops), to whose intramembrane surface at-RAL is thought
  to weakly associate (); at-RAL must diffuse to the membrane–cytosol interface and
  position its aldehyde group for RDH-catalyzed reduction to at-ROL. at-ROL is oriented
  with its dipole axis parallel to the membrane lipids () and should preferentially
  remain with its alcohol group near the membrane surface (). (C) Predicted average
  bleaching of M and L opsin in situ in the whole COS by the stimuli used in the OCT
  experiments of  and  expressed in the units of energy density at the COS waveguide
  entrance (green and red symbols indicate M and L pigments, respectively, which are
  slightly differentially bleached due to their different absorption spectra). The
  thicker black line plots SI Appendix, Eq. S2.6, the fraction bleached over the whole
  COS given as the exponential approximation to the solution of SI Appendix, Eq. S2.4′,
  while the thin black line plots bleaching at the COS waveguide entrance (SI Appendix,
  Eq. 2.5), where 1/ = 1.38 × 108 photons μm−2 is the photosensitivity of cone opsin
  in situ at the pigment λmax and fDens = 0.79 (SI Appendix, Table S1). (The black
  symbols plot the average of the M- and L-opsin values used in the model.) (D) Kinetic
  predictions of the model. The black traces replot a subset of the extracted component
  2 traces along with the fitted exponential curves (red) of  and the model traces
  (magenta). The black filled circles in C show the bleach levels for the specific
  stimuli corresponding to the traces. The topmost data trace is the saturated component
  2 response; its asymptotic level is 200 nm, but this is not reached on this time
  base (cf SI Appendix, section 1).
