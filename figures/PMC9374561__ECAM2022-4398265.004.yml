caption: Rhein inhibits SHH signaling pathway in NRK-49F cells activated by SHH. Western
  blot and qPCR analysis show the expression of Gli1 and Snail increased in NRK-49F
  cells induced by SHH (100 ng·ml−1) for 48 hours. The NRK-49F cells were incubated
  with SHH in the presence of rhein (1 ng·ml−1) or CNP (1 ng·ml−1), and the expression
  of Gli1 and Snail mRNA and protein decreased. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
