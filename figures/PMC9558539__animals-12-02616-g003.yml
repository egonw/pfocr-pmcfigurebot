caption: Effects of acetate on the mRNA levels of key genes involved in lipid metabolism.
  Bovine mammary epithelial cells were exposed to either 0 (as control group) or 12
  mM acetate for the analysis of mRNA levels. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
  analysis of (A) sterol-response-element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), (B) diacylglycerol
  O-Acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), (C) carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), (D)
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), (E) peroxisome Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase
  1 (SCD1), (F) fatty acid synthase (FAS), (G) peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-γ
  (PPARγ), and (H) peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-α (PPARα) in bovine mammary
  epithelial cells. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene. The data are means
  ± SEM (n = 3).
