caption: 'The expression patterns of PdTHC2′GT, PdCHS, and PdCHI. (a) Four blooming
  periods of P. delavayi var. lutea flowers. S1: Unpigmented tight bud, the petals
  are completely green. S2: Slightly pigmented soft bud, the petals begin to change
  from green to yellow. S3: Initially opened flower, the stamens are not visible,
  and the petals have completely turned yellow. S4: Fully opened flower, the stamens
  are completely exposed, and the petals are a lighter yellow than those in S3. (b)
  Comparison of RNA-seq and qRT–PCR analyses for PdTHC2′GT, PdCHS, and PdCHI. The
  different lowercase letters indicate significant differences in RNAseq among the
  different sampling points, the different capital letters indicate significant differences
  in qRT-PCR among the different sampling points (p < 0.05), and the error bars indicate
  the standard deviations.'
