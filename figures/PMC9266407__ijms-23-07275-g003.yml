caption: Visualization of gene expression changes for M0 macrophages derived from
  THP-1 cells exposed to RIVM preparations and Bio-AlcamidÂ® extracts on the cell cycle
  pathway. Cells were exposed for 24 h to extracts of the various HA fillers. At 24
  h, the cells were harvested and RNA isolated for cDNA preparation and microarray
  gene analysis.
