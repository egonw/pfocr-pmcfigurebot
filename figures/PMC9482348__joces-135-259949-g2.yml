caption: KRAS-induced shedding depends on the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain
  of iRhom2 by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. (A) iRhom1/2 DKO HEK293T cells reconstituted
  with iRhom2WT and iRhom2 lacking the three primary phosphorylation sites (iRhom2site1-3)
  were co-transfected with GFP or GFP-tagged KRASG12V and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged
  TGFα, and medium was collected overnight. Error bars represent s.d. ****P<0.0001
  for the induction ratio (KRASG12V/GFP) (one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison
  test). (B) iRhom1/2 DKO HEK293T reconstituted with iRhom2WT and co-transfected with
  GFP or GFP-tagged KRASG12V and AP-tagged TGFα were treated with 10 μM U0126 during
  3 h of medium collection. Data are from six biological replicates. Error bars represent
  s.d. ****P<0.0001 for the log transformed data (one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple
  comparison test). (C) HA-based immunoprecipitates and lysates from iRhom1/2 DKO
  HEK293T cells reconstituted with HA–iRhom2WT and transfected with GFP or GFP-tagged
  KRASG12V were immunoblotted for 14-3-3ε, ADAM17, HA and GFP. To assess the contribution
  of Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, cells were treated with 10 μM U0126 for 2 h and blotted
  for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). Orange arrowhead indicates 14-3-3ε, black and
  grey arrowheads indicate immature proADAM17 and mature ADAM17, respectively, white
  arrowhead indicates HA-tagged iRhom2WT. The experiment was repeated three times.
  A schematic of the rationale of the experiment is shown below the immunoblot. (D)
  HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with AP-tagged TGFα and GFP or GFP-tagged
  ERK-activating oncogenes SRCY530F, KRASG12V, BRAFV600E, HRASG12V, followed by overnight
  medium collection. Data are from six biological replicates. Substrate release is
  the level of released alkaline phosphatase in the medium divided by the total alkaline
  phosphatase level. Error bars represent s.d. ****P<0.0001 for log transformed data
  (one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison test).
