caption: 'Tetrandrine (Tet) reduced intracellular Ca2+ influx and calcineurin (CaN)
  activity in vitro and in vivo. (a) The intracellular Ca2+ influx in MPC5 podocytes
  was identified by fluorescence detection (scale bar = 100 μm). ∗∗P < 0.01 versus
  the lev-NC group. ##P < 0.01 versus the lev-TRPC6 group. (b, c) The CaN activities
  in rats and in MPC5 podocytes. ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control or lev-NC group. ##P
  < 0.01 versus the ADRIA or lev-TRPC6 group. Nephropathy rats were induced by adriamycin
  (ADRIA) and then treated with high-dose Tet (16 mg/kg/d) or cyclosporine A (CsA,
  a positive drug). MPC5 podocytes were transfected with lev-NC or lev-TRPC6 and then
  treated with U73122 (an inhibitor of TRPC6 channel opening), CsA, or Tet.'
