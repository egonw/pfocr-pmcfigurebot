caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and underlying signal pathways in different
  subtypes were identified. (A) The volcano plot showed the DEGs between the two subgroups.
  (B) The heatmap showed the DEGs expression in two subgroups. (C, D) The GO and KEGG
  analyses indicate that there is the enrichment of the proliferation and activity
  of T cells, antigen presentation, T cell receptor signaling, Toll-like receptor
  (TLR) signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathway. (E) GSEA analysis determined
  the significant suppression of crucial signaling pathways involved in T cell receptor
  signaling, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, B cell receptor signaling, antigen
  presentation, and cytokine receptor interaction in the high-risk group (C2).
