caption: GO function and KEGG pathway analysis of HUB genes. (A) Barplot performed
  the top 10 enriched terms of BPs, CCs, and MFs. The horizontal axis represented
  the counts of genes in the enriched term, and the vertical axis represented the
  name of each term. (B) Bubble plot performed the top 20 signaling pathways of TMDCD
  against AA. The horizontal axis represented the enrichment scores of pathways, and
  the vertical axis represented the name of pathways. The counts of genes in each
  enriched pathway were presented via the bubble, and the P-value was marked by the
  bubble color.
