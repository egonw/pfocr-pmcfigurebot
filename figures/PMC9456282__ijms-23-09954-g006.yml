caption: Effect of caffeine on NLRP3/α-SMA dual-labeling in hepatic tissue from the
  NASH model. (A) IF analysis of NLRP3/α-SMA in hepatic tissues from rats in the control,
  HFSCD+CCl4, HFSCD+CCl4+caffeine, and caffeine groups. (B) Quantification of fluorescence
  intensity of NLRP3 and α-SMA (n = 3). Bars represent the mean ± SEM. (a) p < 0.05
  compared with the control group; (b) p < 0.05 compared with the HFSCD+CCl4 group.
  The slides were observed under a confocal microscope at 63× magnification.
