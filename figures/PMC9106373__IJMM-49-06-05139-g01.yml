caption: Functional analysis in LC cell lines following the overexpression of miR-4730.
  (A) Effects of miR-4730 mimic transfection in Li-7 and HepG2 cell lines. miR-4730
  expression was significantly increased following miR-4730 mimic transfection. (B)
  Proliferative ability of LC cell lines was significantly suppressed following miR-4730
  mimic transfection. (C) In cell cycle analysis, G0/G1 arrest was induced following
  miR-4730 mimic transfection. (D) In the apoptosis assay, the number of early apoptotic
  cells was increased following miR-4730 mimic transfection. All experiments were
  performed in triplicate and results are shown as the mean Â± SD. An unpaired t-test
  was used to analyze the data (*P<0.05 and **P<0.01, vs. mock group). LC, liver cancer.
