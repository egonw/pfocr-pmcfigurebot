caption: (A) Enrichment and (B) pathways analyses.The x-axis represents the pathway
  impact value computed from pathway topological analysis, and the y-axis is the-log
  of the p-value obtained from pathway enrichment analysis. The pathways that were
  most significantly changed are characterized by both a high-log(p) value and high
  impact value (top right region). The node color is based on its p-value and the
  node radius is determined based on their pathway impact values.
