caption: 'Erk1/2‐KO mouse hepatocytes have increased Cyp7a1 and decreased Shp expression.
  (A) Heatmap illustrates differential regulation of bile acid pathway genes in Erk1/2‐Con
  versus Erk1/2‐KO mouse livers. (B) Relative mRNA levels in oil‐treated or tamoxifen‐treated
  Erk1/2‐Con and Erk1/2‐KO mice (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared
  with oil‐injected control mice; n = 11‐15). (C) Shp mRNA levels in the same mice
  (*P < 0.0000001 compared with control oil‐injected or tamoxifen‐injected mice; n = 11‐15).
  (D) Relative liver Shp and Cyp7a1 mRNA levels over weeks after tamoxifen injection
  (*P < 0.0001 compared with oil‐injected control mice; n = 7‐8). (E) Cyp7a1 mRNA
  levels in mouse hepatocytes from Erk1/2‐Con and Erk1/2‐KO mice treated with TCA
  for the indicated number of hours in culture (*P < 0.0003 compared with untreated
  control hepatocytes; n = 6). (F) Shp mRNA levels in the same cells (*P < 0.01 compared
  with untreated control hepatocytes; #P < 0.01 compared with untreated knockout cells;
  n = 6). (G) Cyp7a1 levels in hepatocytes treated with IL‐1β for the indicated times
  (*P < 0.002 compared with untreated control hepatocytes; #P < 0.001 compared with
  untreated knockout cells; n = 4). Abbreviations: Abcb11, ATP binding cassette subfamily
