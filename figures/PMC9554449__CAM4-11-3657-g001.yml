caption: Knockdown of LHX6EX(+12) and LHX6All group suppressed cervical cancer cell
  proliferation in vitro. (A, B) ShRNA silencing of three isoform groups specifically
  downregulated LHX6 isoforms expression in CasKi and HeLa cells validated by qRT‐PCR
  (A) and western blot (B). (C, E) Cell proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation
  assay in CasKi (C) and HeLa cells (E). (D, F) Cell viability was measured by CCK‐8
  assay in CasKi (D) and HeLa cells (F). (G‐I) Representative colony formation images
  and clone‐forming rate relative to the control group in CasKi and HeLa cells. The
  data were presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
