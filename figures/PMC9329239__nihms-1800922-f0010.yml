figure_title: RTN1A competes for HK1 and VDAC1 interaction to activate the inflammasome
  pathway
caption: '(A) Top: Lysates of HK2 cells overexpressing RTN1A or RTN1C were immunoprecipitated
  (IP) with anti-HK1 antibody or control IgG and immunoblotted with VDAC1 antibody.
  Bottom: Input lysates were immunoblotted with VDAC1, RTN1A, and RTN1C antibodies.
  (B) Immunoprecipitation was performed using purified recombinant proteins (DDK-tagged
  HK1, His-tagged VDAC1, and Myc-tagged RTN1A). Interaction of HK1 and VDAC1 was assessed
  with increasing amounts of RTN1A (B) or RTN1C (C) using anti-His antibody and immunoblotted
  with DDK and Myc antibodies. (C-D) Western blot and densitometric analysis of Caspase-1
  in HK2 cells with RTN1A or RTN1C overexpression. (D-G) Western blot and densitometric
  analysis of Caspase-1 and IL-1Î² HK2 cells overexpressing RTN1C or RTN1A with or
  without HK1 overexpression. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001 between
  indicated groups by one-way ANOVA with Tukey''s post hoc analysis.'
