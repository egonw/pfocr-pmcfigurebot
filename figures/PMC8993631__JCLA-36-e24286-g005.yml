caption: circ_0008194 promoted cell invasion in vitro. (A) To evaluate the ability
  of proliferation in cells transfected with circ_0008194 knocking‐down and overexpression
  lentivirus, CCK‐8 assays were used. (B) The distribution of cell cycle stage was
  detected by flow cytometry. (C) Transwell assay was used to evaluate cell invasive
  capabilities in HCC cells. (n.s indicated no significance, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001)
article_title: CircRNA_0008194 functions as a ceRNA to promote invasion of hepatocellular
  carcinoma via inhibiting miR‐190a/AHNAK signaling pathway.
