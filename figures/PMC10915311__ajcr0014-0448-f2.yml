caption: NTS increased pancreatic cancer invasiveness. Human pancreatic cancer cell
  lines MIA PaCa-2 (left column) and PANC-1 (middle column) as well as mouse pancreatic
  cancer cell line KPC (right column) were treated with various concentrations of
  NTS, and their effects on proliferation (A), colony formation (B), migration (C),
  and invasion (D) were assayed. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001.

  and gemcitabine resistance via the NTSR1/Akt pathway.
