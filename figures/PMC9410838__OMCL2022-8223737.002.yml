caption: DEX activates the ferroptotic pathway in SIOP. (a) Quantification of the
  protein level of MT by ELISA. (b) Images of micro-CT. (c) BMD(g/cm3). (d) BV/TV
  (%). (e) Images of immunofluorescence double staining of CD90 and GPX4 in bone tissues.
  (f) Quantitative analysis of the area of GPX4/CD90-positive stains. (g) IHC staining
  of system xc-, GPX4, FSP1, and MT1, and the IHC-positive cells were marked with
  black arrows. (h–k) Quantitative analysis of the number of the IHC-positive cells
  in (g). These studies were performed at least 3 biological replicates. Data represent
  mean ± SD (n = 5). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.005 compared with control group.
