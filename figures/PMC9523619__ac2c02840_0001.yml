caption: CE-ESI-MS analysis of N-glycans released from human plasma after differential
  sialic acid derivatization and cationic reducing end labeling. (a) Extracted ion
  electropherograms (EIEs) from nine of the most abundant N-glycans observed across
  the entire migration window, separated with the commercially available, statically
  coated neutral capillary (OptiMS, SCIEX). Significant differences in the separation
  efficiency are obtained by applying a period of 0 min (top) and 30 min (bottom)
  zero flow. (b) Magnification of EIEs of H4N4, H5N4F1S2,31, H6N5S2,32S2,61, and H6N5F1S2,32S2,61,
  in which the number of isomers is depicted, together revealing the resolving power
  obtained by applying 30 min zero flow. *â€¯Indicates an in-source decay product of
  the H6N2. The depicted structures are based on exact mass, literature, and knowledge
  of the biosynthetic pathway; monosaccharide linkages were not determined except
  for the sialic acids.
