caption: 'Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression response to LPS/CDDO-IM treatment.
  Co-treatment with CDDO-IM in macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in
  the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by LPS in the macrophages differentiated
  from ML-1 cells. Cells were treated with 400 nM CDDO-IM for 24 h, followed by a
  3-h 100 ng/mL LPS treatment. Gene expression levels of (a) IL-8, (b) IL-1β, (c)
  TNF-α, and (d) MCP-1 were measured by real-time PCR and data were normalized using
  GAPDH. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 3, *p < 0.05 vs control; #p < 0.05 vs LPS
  only). The differences between treatments were measured by one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)'
