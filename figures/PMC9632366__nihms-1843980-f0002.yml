caption: 'Response to Treatment with Acetylsalicylic Acid(A) Primary Indication for
  Treatment with Acetylsalicylic Acid and Response at the Completion of Therapy: The
  primary complaint that motivated initiation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy
  was recorded as the primary indication for treatment for each patient (x-axis).
  At the completion of therapy change in this symptom was recorded as stable, or improved.
  The histogram illustrates the number of patients who had improvement in their chief
  complaint using ASA and those who did not. No patients had worsening of their primary
  complaint during therapy.(B) Clinical Improvement in Oral and Neck Lymphatic Malformations:
  (1): Two year old patient who presented with sudden neck swelling and limited range
  of motion. She was admitted for antibiotics. An MRI demonstrated an extensive stage
  III lymphatic malformation extending from the parotid to the mediastinum. At the
  first outpatient follow-up the mass was smaller and neck mobility was back to baseline
  (picture shown). She was started on ASA. (2): Patient at 6 months after initiating
  ASA with decreased size of the lesion. (3): Patient with life-long oral lesions
  that would become larger with an upper respiratory infection, and were sensitive
  to certain foods, but was otherwise asymptomatic. She has a PIK3CA p.E545K mutation.
  She was started on ASA at 6.5 years of age (picture shown). (4): Patient 4 months
  after initiation of ASA with decreased size and vascularity of the lesions.'
