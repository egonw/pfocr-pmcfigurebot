caption: Inhibition of HDAC6 leads to increased expression of NICD but suppresses
  the Notch signaling pathway. HPMEC-Im transduced with lentivirus containing sc shRNA
  or HDAC6 shRNA. (A) DLL4, HES1, HEY1, and JAG1 mRNA expression was assessed by qRT-PCR
  sc shRNA vs. HDAC6 shRNA, n = 6 independent experiments, * p < 0.05. (B) NICD protein
  expression was assessed by immunoblotting, with densitometry shown graphically (C),
  n = 4 independent experiments, and * p < 0.05. (D) Acetylated tubulin expression
  and ERK phosphorylation were assessed by immunoblotting, with densitometry shown
  graphically (E), n = 3 independent experiments, and * p < 0.05. (F) TP1-Luc2 luciferase
  assay was applied to assess Notch signaling activity in sc shRNA or HDAC6 shRNA-expressed
  HEK293 cells, n = 5 independent experiments and * p < 0.05.
