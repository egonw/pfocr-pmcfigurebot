figure_title: Proteomic characterization of organoid models
caption: A–CVolcano plots of proteomic analyses of the organoid models. Plots indicate
  up‐ and downregulated proteins compared with uninduced controls (biological replicates
  n = 2–3).DComparison of significantly altered biological processes (Gene Ontology)
  identified by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) (q‐value < 0.1) between the organoid
  models.
