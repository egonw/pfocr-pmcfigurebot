caption: 'Fasudil suppressed the YAP/ERK/ETA/ETBsignaling pathway in HA spasm by inhibiting
  ROCK activation. (A) Western blotting showed that Fasudil injection decreased the
  expressions of ROCK, p-ERK1/2, YAP1, ETA, and ETB under mechanical pressure stimulated
  human vascular smooth muscle cells. The decreased expressions of ROCK, p-ERK1/2,
  YAP1, ETA, and ETB in Fasudil group were restored by ROCK-OE. (B) The quantitative
  analysis of relative protein levels uncovered that the expressions of ROCK, p-ERK1/2,
  YAP1, ETA, and ETB were increased in Fasudil group compared with those in Model
  group or Sham group. All P<0.05: Fasudil group vs. Model group or Sham group. The
  relative protein levels of ROCK, p-ERK1/2, YAP1, ETA, and ETB in Fasudil group were
  restored by ROCK-OE Lentivirus.'
