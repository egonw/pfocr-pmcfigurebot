figure_title: Activation of the MYD88 pathway induces RANKL via the ERK-CREB/STAT3
  axes in the osteocyte-enriched cell population
caption: 'a Western blotting of phosphorylated (p) and total ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-kB
  p65 proteins in Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or PBS. min. = minutes. b, c qPCR analysis
  of Rankl. Ocy was pretreated with increasing concentrations of inhibitors or vehicle
  (DMSO) for 2 h before stimulation with Pam3CSK4 or PBS for 8 h. Representative data
  from three independent experiments with similar results, each with three replicates
  (n = 3). d Western blotting of phosphorylated (p) and total CREB and STAT3 proteins
  in Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or PBS. min. = minutes. e Left: Western blotting
  of phosphorylated (p) and total CREB and STAT3 proteins. Ocy was pretreated with
  the MYD88 inhibitor T6167923 (20 µM) or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 h before stimulation
  with Pam3CSK4 or PBS for 8 h. Right: Densitometric analysis of the p-CREB/CREB and
  p-STAT3/STAT3 ratio using ImageJ. f Left: Western blotting of phosphorylated (p)
  and total CREB and STAT3 proteins. Ocy was pretreated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor
  U0126 (20 µM) or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 h before stimulation with Pam3CSK4 or PBS
  for 8 h. Right: Densitometric analysis of the p-CREB/CREB and p-STAT3/STAT3 ratio
  using ImageJ. e, f Graphs were created from the data of three independent experiments
  (n = 3). g CUT & RUN assays of CREB and STAT3 in Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4 or
  PBS for 8 h. Inductions of CREB and STAT3 binding to the Rankl promoter and enhancers
  were quantitated by qPCR relative to the isotype control IgGs (fold enrichment).
  Representative data from three independent experiments with similar results, each
  with three replicates (n = 3). The diagram shows the mouse Rankl promoter and enhancer
  loci and the binding sites of CREB and STAT3 in Ocy stimulated with Pam3CSK4. TSS
  = Transcription start site. a–g Pam3 = Pam3CSK4. a, d, e, f Representative images
  from more than three independent experiments. b, c, e, f, g Data are presented as
  mean ± SD. b, c, e, f *p < 0.05 with one-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer test. ns = not
  significant. g #p < 0.05 with two-tailed unpaired t-test. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file.'
