figure_title: Model of betacoronavirus activation of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway and downstream
  effects on interferon signaling
caption: MHV, OC43 and MERS-CoV infection induces ER stress that leads to IRE1α autophosphorylation
  and downstream IRE1α RNase mediated XBP1 splicing producing XBP1s. In contrast,
  SARS-CoV-2 infection only partially activates IRE1α through autophosphorylation
  but prevents the activation of the RNase activity. XBP1s maintains a low basal level
  upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. MERS, OC43 and MHV efficiently antagonize dsRNA induction
  of IFN signaling. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 allows dsRNA induction of some IFN signaling
  and basal XBP1s potentiates the induction of IFN signaling upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
