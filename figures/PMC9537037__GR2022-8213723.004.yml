caption: 'Generation of a bone metastasis-related ceRNA network. (a-c) Differentially
  expressed lncRNAs (a), miRNAs (b), and mRNAs (c) identified when comparing the LRBM
  and HRBM cohorts. The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes are shown for each
  category, with horizontal lines corresponding to an adjusted P value of 0.05. (a,
  c) Vertical lines correspond to a log2 (fold change) at −1 and 1. (b) Vertical lines
  correspond to a log2 (fold change) at −0.58 and 0.58. (d) A ceRNA network was generated
  in which lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were represented by hexagons, rhombuses, and
  ovals, respectively. (e) Enriched GO terms associated with mRNAs differentially
  expressed between the LRBM and HRBM cohorts, with the top 10 terms in each of three
  categories being shown. BP: biological processes. CC: cell component. MF: molecular
  function. (f) KEGG enrichment analyses for mRNAs differentially expressed in the
  HRBM and LRBM cohorts. The brown module was composed of five genes that were upregulated
  in HRBM patient samples, among which COL10A1 was the hub gene (). These five genes
  were enriched for GO terms including extracellular matrix structural constituent,
  extracellular matrix structural constituent conferring tensile strength, heparin
  binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, and sulfur compound binding (), as well as the
  protein digestion and absorption of KEGG pathway (). In the brown module PPI network,
  COL11A1 and COL10A1 were predicted to interact ().'
