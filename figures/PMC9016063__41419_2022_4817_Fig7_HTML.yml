figure_title: METTL3 accelerates PTC malignant progression by upregulating STEAP2
caption: A BCPAP and TPC-1 cell lines were transfected with METTL3-overexpression
  (METTL3) plasmids and siRNA targeting STEAP2 (si-STEAP2) as indicated. The expression
  levels of METTL3 and STEAP2 were quantified by western blot assay. The effects of
  METTL3 and STEAP2 on proliferative ability of PTC cells were measured by CCK-8 assay
  (B), colony formation assay (C), and EdU assay (D). The effects of METTL3 and STEAP2
  on invasive ability of PTC cells were determined by transwell migration assay (E),
  transwell invasion assay (F), and wound healing assay (G). All data are presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  and ***P < 0.001.

  thyroid cancer progress by blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition.
