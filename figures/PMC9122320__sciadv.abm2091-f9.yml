figure_title: A model of touch-induced gene expression pathways
caption: Mechanical stimulation results in physical deformation of the cell wall and
  plasma membrane. Several plasma membrane–associated proteins are important in regulation
  of downstream signaling and gene expression. Mechanically activated Ca2+ channels
  allow influx of Ca2+ ions from the apoplast to the intracellular space. Ca2+ may
  be captured by calmodulins, which, in turn, may modulate the activity of downstream
  regulators such as the transcription factors CAMTA1-3. Next, CAMTA1-3 activate the
  expression of JA-independent touch-responsive genes, e.g., cell wall modifiers (EXLA1/3
  and TCH4) and other calmodulins (TCH2/3 and CML23), potentially acting as a positive
  feedback loop. Simultaneously, mechanical stimulation also results in activation
  of a JA-dependent signaling pathway mediated by MYC2/3/4/5 transcription factors,
  activating downstream genes involved in defense and JA biosynthesis [such as 13-lipoxygenases
  (LOX), 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductases, and allene oxide cyclases], also
  acting as a positive feedback loop. Kinases such as calcium-dependent protein kinases
  (CDPKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are likely involved in mediating
  signaling from, e.g., the plasma membrane to downstream regulators such as TREPH1
  and transcription factors. Feronia (FER) receptor–like kinase negatively regulates
  excessive JA-dependent touch signaling, likely by inhibitory phosphorylation of
  MYC2/3/4/5. FER may also regulate part of the touch response independently of JA/MYC2
  pathways. Some overlap between the JA-dependent and JA-independent signaling pathways
  also occurs, as, for instance, bHLH19 requires both pathways to be fully touch-induced.
  Collectively, all these changes can translate into various thigmomorphogenic and
  defense-related responses.
