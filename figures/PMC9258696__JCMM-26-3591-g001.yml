caption: RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway map. Activated T cells induce the activation of the
  JNK pathway by activating c‐Jun, resulting in signal transduction. T cells secrete
  a large amount of RANKL, which binds to its receptor rank, recruits TRAF, activates
  the signalling pathway downstream of TR6AF; alternative, RANKL promotes the production
  of OCs by inducing C‐fos and AP‐1 activation to promote the expression of NFATC1,
  resulting in an increase in OC production. OPG secreted by osteoblasts and dendritic
  cells acts as bait receptors for RANKL, which competitively inhibits the binding
  of RANKL to RANK, thereby inhibiting OC differentiation
