caption: 'Effect of storax on myocardial injury and fibrosis in ISO-induced AMI rats.
  (A) Quantitative analysis of the expression levels of aspartate aminotransferase
  (AST), creatine kinase iso-enzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and α-hydroxybutyrate
  dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) in serum of rats in different groups (n = 6). (B) Representative
  images of hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining in each group (scale bar = 250 μm or 50
  μm, n = 4), vascular congestion (green arrows), macrophages (blue arrows), edema
  (red arrows), necrosis (yellow arrows). (C) Representative images of Masson staining
  in each group (scale bar = 250 μm or 50 μm, n = 4). (D) Quantitative analysis of
  the proportion of collagen fibers. The blue-stained area is collagen fiber organization.
  (E) Heat map of cluster analysis of biochemical indexes regulated by different groups.
  Results are presented as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post
  hoc test: ** p < 0.01 vs. model group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. vehicle group.'
