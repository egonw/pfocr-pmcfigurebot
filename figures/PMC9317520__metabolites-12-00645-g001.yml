caption: Untargeted metabolomic experiments were designed to identify dysregulated
  metabolites for later testing for activity. (A) Plasma was collected prior to virus
  inoculation (day 0) and after 5 days of infection, 24–48 h prior to DBA1 mice death.
  For validation, a similar analysis was performed separately on C57BL/6J (B mice)
  and FVB/N (F mice), a model that has shown similar behavior in the response to LCMV
  Cl13. The known phenotypic outcomes in both models enhanced our chance of observing
  relevant metabolites associated with CTL responses and survival. (B) Untargeted
  metabolomics pathway analysis and cognitive-driven accelerated literature mining
  were used to prioritize those metabolites that might play significant roles in mediating
  the differential T-cell responses. (C) Over 70 metabolites were found to be dysregulated
  in the DBA model between day 0 and 5 of LCMV Cl13 infection (q < 0.05, one-way ANOVA
  followed by a Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test). All but two metabolites (citric
  acid and N-acetylmuramic acid) were also detected in the validation model. Metabolite
  changes at day 5 were calculated using day 0 levels as a reference and represented
  in a heatmap using a logarithmic scale. (D) Pathway analysis at day 5 after inoculation
  was carried out to predict the metabolic pathways that were more dysregulated between
  mice that survived and died.
