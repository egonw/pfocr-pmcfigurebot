caption: TSPAN31 is highly expressed in GC. (A) High-throughput sequencing analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer (GC) tissues. (B) The UALCAN
  database was used to analyze the expression level of TSPAN31 in GC tissues. (C)
  Determination of the expression level of TSPAN31 in GC tissues by qRT-PCR. (D) Analysis
  of the protein level of TSPAN31 in GC tissues by western blot assay. (E) Determination
  of the protein level of TSPAN31 in GC tissues by immunohistochemistry. (F) Analysis
  of the expression level of TSPAN31 in GC cells by qRT-PCR (⁎⁎P < 0.01; ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001).
article_title: TSPAN31 regulates the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of gastric
  cancer cells through the METTL1/CCT2 pathway.
