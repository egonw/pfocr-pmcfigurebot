caption: Irisin inhibits TCs inflammasome activation and fibrosis. TCs were treated
  with DHT, in the presence or absence of irisin. A The expression of ASC and GSDMD
  in TCs was assessed by qRT-PCR. B The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  factors (GSDMD, GSDMD-C, ASC, IL-1β and IL-18) in TCs was analyzed by western blot
  assay. C The expression of fibronectin and β-catenin in TCs was assessed by qRT-PCR.
  D The expression of fibrosis factors (collagen I, P-SMAD3, α-SMA, TGF-β) in TCs
  was analyzed by western blot assay. E Exercise-induced irisin improves follicular
  dysfunction by inhibiting the IRE1α-TXNIP/ROS-NLRP3 pathway in the PCOS signaling
  pathway. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01. Ctrl, control;
  DHT, dihydrotestosterone; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDMD-C, C-terminal fragment of gasdermin D; IL-1β,
  interleukin-1β; IL-18, interleukin-18; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  α-SMA, a-smooth muscle actin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta; ERS, endoplasmic
  reticulum stress; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IRE1α, inositol-requiring enzyme
  1α; TXNIP, thioredoxin-interacting protein; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family pyrin
  domain containing 3
