caption: Phosphorylation of ERK mediates the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway
  in enterovirus 71 infection. (a) Inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK declined the
  level of NF-κB (p65) in the nucleus after EV71 infection. NF-κB (P65) expression
  level both in Control and ERK inhibitor (PD098059) groups by using Western immunoblotting
  analysis. (b) NF-κB (P65) and GAPDH ratio analyzed between the ERK inhibitor (PD098059)
  and control groups by gray analysis of Western immunoblotting. * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01 and *** p < 0.0001.
