caption: Heatmap of TBP-associated factors expressed in retina samples. After ON infarct,
  18 TBP-associated factors were upregulated by GCSF treatment. There were 17 TBP-associated
  factors that were downregulated by PBS treatment. Genes were clustered into the
  regulation of cell survival based on gene expression over time. Up- and downregulation
  are represented in red and blue colors, respectively.
