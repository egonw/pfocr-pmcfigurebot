caption: 'Main pathways of interest for targeted therapies in medulloblastoma. SHH
  pathway: in the absence of SHH, PTCH1 suppresses SMO activation. This suppression
  is released upon binding of SHH. Active SMO promotes GLI dissociation from SUFU,
  allowing for its translocation to the nucleus. The SMO inhibitors vismodegib and
  sonidegib and the CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib have been used to target this pathway.
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway alterations play a crucial
  role in medulloblastoma. Several drugs that inhibit either PI3K, mTOR, or both are
  undergoing clinical evaluation. CDK signaling pathway: the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex
  phosphorylates Rb, preventing binding of the E2F transcription factor. Translocation
  of E2F to the nucleus promotes S-phase entry and progression. Several clinical trials
  using CDK4/6 inhibitors in medulloblastoma are ongoing. Abbreviations: SHH, sonic
  hedgehog; SMO, smoothened; PTCH1, patched 1; SUFU, suppressor of fused homolog;
  GLI, glioma-associated oncogene homolog; CK2, casein kinase 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; CDK, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 1 May 2023).'
