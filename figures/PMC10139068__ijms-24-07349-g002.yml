caption: (A) Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) constructed the
  Arabidopsis Drought-specific Gene Co-expression Network (ADGCN) encompassing 9370
  nodes connected by 402,598 weighted edges (≥0.75). Nodes are colored based on their
  specific module assignment. Most significant modules based on connectivity and clustering
  coefficient were annotated by GO analysis and the enriched pathways are listed next
  to their respective modules (p-value ≤ 0.05). (B–D) ADGCN network analysis plots
  displaying clustering coefficient (CC) (B), betweenness centrality (C), and degree
  distribution (D). (E) Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses of high
  CC (green), high bottleneck (red), and high hub (violet) genes.
