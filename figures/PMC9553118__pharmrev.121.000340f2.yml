caption: Voltage-gated Na+ channel β1 subunits undergo RIP following cleavage by BACE1
  and γ-secretase. As shown in , cleavage of the VGSC β1 ectodomain by BACE1 and subsequent
  intracellular cleavage by γ-secretase results in the release of a soluble β1-ICD
  that translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. (A) Strong colocalization
  was observed between staining for the V5 epitope tag of the β1-ICD and the nucleus
  (DAPI, yellow), whereas full-length WT β1-V5 shows little to no nuclear localization.
  (B) Quantification of intensity of V5 and DAPI staining across transfected CHL cells.
  (C) RNA sequencing experiments were performed in CHL cells that overexpress the
  β1-ICD versus eGFP and in postnatal day 10 Scn1b null versus wild-type mouse cardiac
  ventricle. (D) As shown by gene ontology group analyses, β1-ICD overexpression (left)
  and a deletion of β1 in Scn1b null cardiac ventricle (right), in which the β1-ICD
  signaling pathway is absent, resulted in similarly altered gene subsets. Specifically,
  genes involved in calcium ion binding, the immune response, and cell proliferation
  were found to be changed in response to both β1 overexpression and deletion. Used
