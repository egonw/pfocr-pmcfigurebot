caption: The intracellular polyamine metabolic pathway. The primary polyamine metabolic
  pathway occurs in the cytoplasm of all cells and involves the formation of polyamines
  (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) from ornithine through ornithine decarboxylase
  enzyme. The intracellular source of ornithine is from the urea cycle in the liver.
  S-adenosylmethionine metabolism is a parallel pathway that contributes to synthesis
  of polyamines. This is a part of the methionine cycle which occurs in the cytoplasm
  of all cells, including cardiomyocytes. Figure created using BioRender
