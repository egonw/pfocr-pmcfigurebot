figure_title: RP1-59D14.5 recruits HUR to promote CK1 expression and activates the
  Hippo pathway in PCa cells
caption: 'A, B RT-qPCR and western blot detected the mRNA and protein levels of LATS1/2
  and CK1. C RNA pull down assays analyzed the proteins combined with RP1-59D14.5.
  M: marker. HuR: 36 kDa. D RNA pulldown assay analyzed the interaction between HUR
  and RP1-59D14.5. E RIP assays detected the enrichment of RP1-59D14.5 and CK1. F
  RT-qPCR and western blot detected the levels of HUR with HUR overexpression. β-actin
  serves as an internal control. G, H RT-qPCR and western blot detected mRNA level
  of CK1 and protein levels of CK1, YAP and p-YAP in HUR-overexpressed cells. **P < 0.01.'
