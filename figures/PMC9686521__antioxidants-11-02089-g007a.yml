caption: Downregulation of Nrf2 expression in the 6-OHDA-exposed SH-SY5Y cells abrogates
  the neuroprotective ability of narcissoside (NCS). SH-SY5Y cells were transfected
  with Nrf2 siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h. It was then pretreated with NCS for 24
  h, followed by treatment with 6-OHDA for 6 h. (A) The levels of Nrf2, GCLC, and
  GCLM were analyzed by western blotting. The expression of β-tubulin is internal
  loading control (top left). The intensity of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ
  software (right and bottom). (B) ROS levels were measured using the H2DCFDA method.
  (C) GSH levels were determined by GSH assay kit. (D) Protein levels of JNK, p-JNK,
  p38, p-p38, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, Akt and p-Akt were determined by western blot. The
  expression of β-tubulin is as internal loading control. (top left). The intensity
  of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right and bottom). (E) The
  ratio of cleaved caspase 3/pro caspase 3 and cleaved PARP/pro PARP was determined
  by western blotting. The expression of β-tubulin is internal loading control (top
  left). The intensity of the signal was quantified by the ImageJ software. (right
  and bottom). (F) The ratio of apoptotic cells was determined by TUNEL assay.
