caption: Environmental conditions in the nocturnal light organ conducive to the induction
  of competence and natural transformation in V. fischeri symbionts. The four known
  cardinal environmental inducers of competence are shown in separate quadrants (A–D),
  with arrows indicating induction pathways (not all intermediate pathway enzymes
  are represented). The putative effects of low pH on the individual induction signals
  are represented by fuchsia arrows. (A) Host-secreted chitin lowers pH via fermentation.
  Lowered pH may directly act as a competence inducer as it does in some Gram+ species.
  []. (B) Nutrient deprivation towards the end of the night has been inferred in the
  light organ [,,]. (C) Nutrient deprivation-induced cell death, along with T6SS-mediated
  killing, provide a source of DNA/nucleosides. (D) Low pH is known to modulate quorum-sensing
  signaling in some gram positive species [].
