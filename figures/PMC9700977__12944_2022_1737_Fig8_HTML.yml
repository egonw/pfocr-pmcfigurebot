caption: Manual therapy could alter target metabolites in patients with cNLBP. A Comparison
  of the volumes of cytidine, uridine 5’-monophosphate, kynurenic acid, guanosine,
  inosine, 2’-deoxyadenosine, stachydrine, and N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine in patients
  treated with and without manual therapy for 2 weeks. Different letters show a significant
  difference from nontreated patients using Student’s t test (P < 0.05). B Pathway
  enrichment analysis revealed that pyrimidine metabolism and purine metabolism pathways
  were enriched in patients treated with manual therapy (P value cutoff ≤ 0.05)
