caption: Two prototypical apoptotic pathways (extrinsic and intrinsic) initiated by
  separate events converge at a common place to execute apoptosis. Main associations
  of these apoptotic pathways to the neurodegenerative disorders AD, PD, HD as well
  as SZ are indicated. Death receptor pathways triggered by binding of death receptors
  by their ligands (tumor necrosis factor (TNF, FasL) that results in receptor clustering
  and recruitment of adaptor proteins, leading to the activation of initiator caspase-8.
  The intrinsic pathway responds to a variety of cellular stress signals that act
  on mitochondria to cause leakage of pro-apoptotic effectors like cytochrome c and
  apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 in the presence of
  ATP to form the “apoptosome”, which subsequently recruits and activates initiator
  pro-caspase-9. AIF translocates to the nucleus to cause high molecular weight DNA
  fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner. Both pathways activate effector caspases-3
  and -7. Endoplasmic reticulum stress causes the activation and release of caspase-12,
  leading to apoptotic cell death. AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; AD, Alzheimer’s
  disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Apaf, apoptotic protease activating
  factor; Bak, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer; Bax, Bcl-2 associated X protein;
  Bcl, B-cell lymphoma; Bid, BH3 interacting domain death agonist; Casp, caspase;
  CytC, cytochrome c; FADD, Fas-associated-death-domain protein; FAS, cysteine-rich
  transmembrane protein CD95; HD, Huntington’s disease; PD, Parkinson’s disease; SZ,
  schizophrenia; tBid, truncated Bid; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
