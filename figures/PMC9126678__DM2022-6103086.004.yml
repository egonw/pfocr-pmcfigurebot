caption: circ_000166 can serve as the ceRNA of miR-296. (a) Sequence of circ_000166
  and miR-296 in mouse. (b) The dual-luciferase report detects luciferase activity
  in mouse kidneys. (c–e) We used qRT-PCR to detect the expression of circ_000166
  and miR-296 in each group of mouse kidneys. The data are average ± standard. ∗p
  < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
