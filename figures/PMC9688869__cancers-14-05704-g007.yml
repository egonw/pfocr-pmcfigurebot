caption: ACY1 inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to regulate the radiosensitivity
  of HCT116-R cells. (A) Spearman’s correlation analysis of ACY1 expression and WNT3,
  CTNNB1, and GSK3B in the TCGA COAD dataset. (B) Spearman’s correlation analysis
  of ACY1 expression and WNT8B, CTNNB1, and GSK3B in the TCGA READ dataset. (C) The
  Western blot assay revealed the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in HCT116-R
  cells treated with 0, 4, and 6 Gy. (D) The Western blot assay revealed that the
  levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin in HCT116-R cells transfected with siRNA-NC or
  siRNA-ACY1 treated with 4 Gy. The experiment was repeated three times, and the data
  are presented as the mean ± SD.
