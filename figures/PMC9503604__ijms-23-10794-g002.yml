caption: The relevant diseases/symptoms improved by D-AAs administration were through
  its direct and indirect action. NMDAR pathway is vital to ameliorate many symptoms
  with respect to psychological and physiological defects, such as depression, and
  vision, etc. H2S can be generated from the metabolic process of D-AA. H2S is important
  to gastrointestinal function, and inflammation process, etc. D-AAs have both direct
  and indirect action on anti-oxidative damage, whereas some acoustic protection,
  and radiation protection, etc. are associated with anti-oxidative damage. Inhibiting
  tumor cell growth, disengaging biofilm, regulating intestinal bacterial, and regulating
  T cells, etc. are important elements of the protective effect of D-AAs.
