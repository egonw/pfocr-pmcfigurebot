caption: The cross-omic approach identified that 11 out of 105 synthetases are upregulated
  during the early stage of atherosclerosis development. It suggests that 10.5% of
  metabolites-synthetases are upregulated, while 88.5% of upregulated metabolites
  may result from post-translational/enzymatic responses to early hyperlipidemia.
  (A) An illustration of the strategy for synthetic enzyme gene identifications. Significantly
  upregulated metabolites (p < 0.05, FC > 2) in four tissues were selected. The selected
  metabolites was searched into the metabolic pathway section in the BRENDA database
  (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/) to find 38 known metabolites. Through analysis
  of those 38 metabolites, we identified 105 direct synthetic enzymes in four of the
  tissues. (B) Multiple enzyme interactions were generated by https://string-db.org/,
  implying that enzyme activity upregulations could be modulated via enzyme interactions.
  (C) Two datasets such as GSE72248 and GSE10000 microarray datasets were selected
  for enzymatic alteration analysis. The expressions of 105 synthetase genes in APOE
  KO fed with high fat diet for 3 weeks were compared with that in WT normal chow
  diet mice aorta (GSE72248), ApoE KO fed with high fat diet for 6 weeks, 32 weeks,
  and 72 weeks compared with WT normal chow diet for the same corresponding experimental
  time points in the dataset GSE10000. The only 11 synthases were significantly changed
  (p-value <0.05) during atherosclerosis development.
