caption: 'Functional enrichment analysis of selected differentially expressed transcripts
  in ovarian (A) and endometrial (B) tissue between SS-7 group (sows treated with
  altrenogest for 7 d beginning on the day of weaning and superovulated with equine
  chorionic gonadotropin 24 h after the last altrenogest administration and human
  chorionic gonadotropin at the onset of estrus) and SC (superovulated sows with equine
  chorionic gonadotropin 24 h after weaning and human chorionic gonadotropin at the
  beginning of estrus) and NC (sows with postweaning natural estrus) groups. Enrichment
  analysis was performed using g:Profiler (version e106_eg53_p16_65fcd97) with the
  g:SCS multiple testing correction method applying significance threshold of 0.05
  (), where functional categories were represented in the x-axis as GO BP: Go Term-Biological
  Processes; KEGG: Pathways from KEGG database; REAC: Reactome pathway database.'
article_title: Combined synchronization and superovulation treatments negatively impact
  embryo viability possibly by the downregulation of WNT/Î²-catenin and Notch signaling
  genes in the porcine endometrium.
