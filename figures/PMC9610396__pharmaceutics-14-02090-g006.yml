caption: The cancer antigen-presenting machinery and the involvement of nanoparticles
  in the antitumor immunity pathway (this figure was created By Figdraw). Dendritic
  cells capture antigens to present them to T cells, leading to T-cell activation.
  Activated T cells target and kill tumor cells. Tumor tissue can affect DC presentation
  through the secretion of immunosuppressive factors and the role of immune checkpoints
  in suppressing T cells. Nanoparticles can promote DC and T-cell activation by delivering
  tumor vaccines, cytokines, etc., which can promote the presentation of tumor antigens.
  At the same time, the antitumor effect of T cells can be enhanced by delivering
  immune checkpoint inhibitors.
