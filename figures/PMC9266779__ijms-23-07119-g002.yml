caption: Protein expression of immunosuppressive regulators in shear stress-induced
  hPDLSCs. Shear stress promoted IDO activity (A) and the kynurenine product (B) in
  hPDLSCs. Shear stress increased the secretion of active TGF-1 in PDLSC-derived conditioned
  medium (C). TGF-1 protein expression in hPDLSCs was determined by Western blot analysis
  (D). The quantitative analysis of Western blot band intensity of latent TGF-1(E)
  and active TGF-1 (F). The concentration of IFN- in cell lysate (G) and conditioned
  medium (H) and the amount of COX2-independent PGE2 were determined by ELISA assay
  (I). * p < 0.05 vs. control group.
