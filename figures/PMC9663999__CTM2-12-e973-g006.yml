caption: Identified the signature genes significantly associated with colon cancer
  metastasis. Clustering dendrogram of the eigengenes and adjacency with cancer metastasis
  dissimilarity based on topological overlap. (A) The left panel shows a hierarchical
  clustering dendrogram of the eigengenes in which the dissimilarity of eigengenes
  (EI, EJ is given by 1 – cor (EI, EJ)). The heatmap in right panel shows the eigengene
  adjacency (AI J = (1 + cor (EI, EJ))/2). The Gene Significance of all modules identified
  correlated with colon cancer metastasis. (B) Distribution of average gene significance
  and errors in the significant modules associated with cancer metastasis. There is
  a highly significant correlation between genes significance (GS) and module membership
  (MM) in this module that the most important elements of module tend to be highly
  correlated with colon cancer metastasis. (C) Comprehensive analysis showed that
  red module that the most was the most significantly with colon cancer metastasis.
  (D) The top 10 functional and pathway enrichment analysis of the significant genes
  in red module that associated with colon cancer metastasis. Significantly biological
  processes, cellular components, molecular functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis by DAVID (p < .01). (E) The 17 genes
  as candidate of signature genes were identified by overlapped 111 genes by DAVID
  enrichment analysis and top250 up‐regulated genes in COAD by UALCAN database. (F)
  The eight signature genes were filtered by GEPIA database through 17 genes candidates,
  which are significantly over‐expression in colon cancer patients. The data were
  expressed as the means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) (*p value < .001)
