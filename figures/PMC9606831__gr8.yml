caption: Histone acetylation is required for Bmi1 induction under high glucose condition
  in PC cells. (A) Western blot of histone H3ac, histone H4ac, and Bmi1 proteins in
  PC cells treated with or without VPA under different glycemic conditions. (B) Western
  blot of ACLY, histone H3ac, histone H4ac, and Bmi1 proteins in ACLY knockdown PC
  cells treated with or without VPA. (C) Western blot of histone H3ac, histone H4ac,
  and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells treated with or without C646 under different glycemic
  conditions. (D) Western blot of histone H3ac, histone H4ac, and Bmi1 proteins in
  PC cells treated with or without C646 under different concentrations of acetate.
  (E) Western blot of KAT2A, histone H3ac, and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells transfected
  with ncRNA or KAT2A siRNA under different glycemic conditions. (F) Western blotof
  KAT5, histone H4ac, and Bmi1 proteins in PC cells transfected with ncRNA or KAT5
  siRNA under different glycemic conditions. (G) Examination of histone H4 acetylation
  status in the Bmi1 gene promoter region in PC cells under high glucose or normal
  conditions using ChIP.
