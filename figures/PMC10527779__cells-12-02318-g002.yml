caption: Schematic presentation of various biochemical cross-talks, involving calcium
  ion (Ca+2), ferrous ion (Fe+2), and Zinc ion (Zn+2) implicated in the progress of
  neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD),
  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). (A). Excitotoxicity (neuronal death) is
  triggered by the excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (neurotoxic)
  from the presynaptic neuron and leads to activation of various biochemical cascades
  leading to neurotoxicity and hence, neuronal death. This process is initiated by
  the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR) by excessive glutamate
  at postsynaptic neurons and thereby the release and accumulation of toxic intraneuronal
  Ca2+. (B). Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity is increased because of the astrocyte-mediated
  downregulation of excitatory amino acid transporters 2 (EAAT2), which slows down
  the uptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft and incites the excitotoxicity cascade.
  (C). Ca2+ overload initiates most of the deleterious downstream mechanisms of the
  cascade, through increasing Ca2+ overload in mitochondria, induction of proteases
  (calpains and caspases), decreasing the proton gradient (ΔpH), mitochondrial membrane
  potential (ΔΨm) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activation of phospholipase A2
  (PLA2) pathway initiating downstream activation of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2), aggravation of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress leading
  to superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) aggregation.
  (D). Surge of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl
  radical (HO•) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) like nitric oxide (NO•) radical,
  formation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−) increases the intraneuronal Zn2+ mobilization,
  which targets mitochondria and further exacerbates Ca2+ dysregulation and ROS production.
  (E). Ca+2 and Fe+2 dysregulation participates in the ferroptosis death of neurons.
  Iron dysregulation leads to Ca2+ dysregulation and vice versa. Excessive glutamate
  increases the Fe+2 intake inside the neurons, thereby leading to excitotoxicity
  and lipid peroxidation via Fenton’s reaction called Ferroptosis. Created with BioRender.com.
