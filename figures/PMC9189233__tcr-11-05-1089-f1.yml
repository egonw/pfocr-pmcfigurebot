caption: Construction of CD73 overexpressed cell models and the effect of CD73 overexpression
  on cervical cancer growth. (A-D) qRT-PCR and FCM showed the higher mRNA and protein
  expression level of CD73 in HelaCD73 and SiHaCD73 cells. (E,F) RTCA showed the increased
  proliferation rate of HelaCD73 and SiHaCD73 cells in vitro. (G,H) Nude mice models
  showed that CD73 overexpression promoted tumor growth in vivo. *, P<0.05. qRT-PCR,
  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; FCM, flow cytometry; RTCA, real-time
  cell analysis.
