caption: 'CuI inhibited PDAC cell viability in a time-dose dependent manner. (A) Morphological
  changes of four PDAC cell lines (AsPC-1, BXPC-3, CFPAC-1, SW 1990) treated with
  different concentrations of CuI (0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 µM), scale bar: 200 µm. (B)
  Chemical structure of CuI. (C) The cell viabilities were measured using the CCK-8.
  The line graph represents the percentage of viable cells in the control group.'
