caption: 'Liver transcriptome in mice exposed to PFOS and fed with diets supplemented
  with different fibers (). (A) Venn diagrams depicting the distribution of transcriptions
  in the liver of mice on cellulose (control), inulin, or pectin diet in response
  to PFOS exposure. (B) Analysis of statistically significant transcripts identified
  by volcano plot. (C) Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes to
  identify biological functions or pathways that differ between PFOS-exposed and control
  mice in three dietary groups. The horizontal axis is  (Padj) of the significantly
  enriched pathway and the vertical axis is the enriched pathway, and the number of
  differentially expressed genes is shown in the parentheses. Detailed transcriptomic
  data are listed in Excel Tables S2â€“S4. Note: AGE, advanced glycation end products;
  Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ECM,
  extracellular matrix; FC, fold change; Padj, adjusted -value; PFOS, perfluorooctane
  sulfonate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor; RAGE, receptor for advance glycation end products; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; TGF, transforming growth factor; TRP, transient receptor potential.'
