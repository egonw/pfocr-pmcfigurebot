caption: 'Characterization of the bacterial communities in hive entrance samples.
  (a) Significantly enriched bacteria in each environment, according to LEfSe. Agricultural
  hives were rich in Gammaproteobacteria and Lactococcus. The classes Actinobacteria
  and Bacteroidia were prevalent in natural samples. Semi-natural samples were enriched
  in the Sphingomonas genus (LDA > 5.0), the Bacilli class, genera from the Alphaproteobacteria
  (Bradyrhizobium, Phyllobacterium) and Gammaproteobacteria (Enhydrobacter) classes,
  as well as genera from the Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes (Gemmatimonas and an uncultured
  genus), and Actinobacteria phyla. (b) Spearman correlation analysis at p < 0.05.
  Positive values were particularly high for Curtobacterium/Hymenobacter, Phyllobacterium/Sphingomonas
  and Phyllobacterium/Bradyrhizobium interactions (R > 0.80, p < 0.0001). The most
  negative interactions were found between Arsenophonus/Spirosoma and Arsenophonus/Nocardioides
  (R ⋍ − 0.6, p < 0.001). (c) Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of samples according
  to the predictive functional profile (MetaCyc pathways). (d) Significantly recruited
  functions according to LEfSe. (e) Significantly enriched enzymes according to LEfSe.
  The enzymes Endo X3 (EC 3.1.22.4) and coenzyme Q reductase (EC 7.1.1.2, formerly
  EC 1.6.5.3) were agricultural representatives, while tryptophan 7-halogenase (EC
  1.14.19.9) was enriched in semi-natural samples. Bifido shunt: Bifidobacterium shunt,
  L-Met transS: l-methionine biosynthesis (transsulfuration), TCA VII: TCA cycle VII
  (acetate-producers), L-Met syn I: l-methionine biosynthesis I, S-Adenosyl-l-Met:
  S-adenosyl-l-methionine biosynthesis, Gondoate syn: gondoate biosynthesis (anaerobic),
  Denovopurine II: purine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis II, Pyrimidine syn II:
  pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis II, Pyridoxal syn I: pyridoxal
  5′-phosphate biosynthesis I, 8-amino-7-oxo: 8-amino-7-oxononanoate biosynthesis
  I, tRNA processing: tRNA processing, Biotin syn: biotin biosynthesis I, PRPP: histidine,
  purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis, KDO Lipid A syn: (Kdo)2-lipid A biosynthesis,
  Pyridoxal sal: pyridoxal 5′-phosphate biosynthesis and salvage, NAD sal III: NAD
  salvage pathway III (to nicotinamide riboside), ppGpp: ppGpp metabolism, LPS syn:
  lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, Mycolate syn: mycolate biosynthesis, Oleate syn
  IV: oleate biosynthesis IV (anaerobic), (5Z)-Dode syn I: (5Z)-dodecenoate biosynthesis
  I. Plotting: Cladograms and histograms of LEfSe results were plotted in Galaxy (web
  application, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) and taxa names cleaned
  with INKSCAPE (v0.92.3-1, https://inkscape.org/). PCoAs were plotted using Vega
  editor (v5.22.1, https://vega.github.io/editor/#/).'
