caption: (A) Freshly isolated T cells from WT or CerS6KO mice were either left unstimulated
  or stimulated with plate bound anti-CD3 at the time points indicated. Some WT T
  cells were also stimulated in the presence of ST1072 at 50ug/ml. These T cells were
  subjected to immunoprecipitation using GST-RAF RBD. Protein lysates were incubated
  with GST-RAF RBD conjugated glutathione sepharose beads. The proteins bound to the
  Glutathione beads (top 2 panels) were analyzed by Western blot using anti-NRAS or
  anti-GST antibodies. Cell lysates were also measured for total or phosphor-ERK antibodies.
  (B) Freshly isolated T cells from WT mice were stimulated in presence and absence
  of ST1072 at the time points indicated. The membrane and cytosolic fraction were
  isolated from these cells and were subjected to western blot analysis for NRAS,
  H-RAS, K-RAS and β-actin. Data shown here is from one of two independent experiments.
  The control or oncogenic NRAS (Q61K) plasmid DNA were transfected into naïve T cells
  using Amaxa Nucleofector kit V from Lonza per manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours
  after, the cells collected and co-cultured with allogeneic antigen presenting cells
  for 5 days in presence or absence of ST1072. Cultured cells were re-stimulated with
  PMA/Ionomycin for 4hrs and analyzed for the percentage of IFN-γ production on gated
  CD4+ or CD8+ cells (C). Data shown is one of the two replicate experiments. Significance
  is determined by Student’s t test. Asterisks indicate statistical significance **p
  < 0.01.
