figure_title: Spontaneous activity of the mitochondrial apoptosis system contributes
  to the generation of micronuclei
caption: A Percentage of micronuclei per cell. HeLa and 1205Lu cells (control cells
  carrying a non-coding gRNA or cells deficient in both Bax and Bak) were stained
  with DAPI and beta-tubulin and assessed by microscopy for micronuclei. A minimum
  of 500 cells per genotype were counted. Symbols give the percentages of micronucleus-positive
  cells per high power field. Columns/error bars are mean/SD of 10 high power fields.
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. B Hela and 1205Lu cells (control cells carrying a non-coding
  gRNA, cells deficient in Apaf-1, cells overexpressing Bcl-XL and cells treated with
  z-VAD (25 µM) for 24 h were stained with DAPI and beta-tubulin and assessed by microscopy
  for micronuclei content. A minimum of 500 cells per genotype were counted. Symbols
  give the percentages of micronucleus-positive cells per high power field. Columns/error
  bars are mean/SD of 10 high power fields. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. C–E Chromosome
  missegregation in Hela and 1205Lu (control cells carrying a non-coding gRNA or cells
  deficient in Bax and Bak, cells deficient in Apaf-1, cells overexpressing Bcl-XL
  and cells treated with z-VAD (25 µM), for 24 h). A minimum of 100 anaphase/ telophase/
  metaphase cells were counted and analyzed for mitotic defects. Data shown are means/SD
  of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05. F Hela cells (control cells
  carrying a non-coding gRNA, cells deficient in Apaf-1 or Bax and Bak and cells treated
  with z-VAD (25 µM) were treated with ABT-737 (10 µM) for 24 h and analyzed for micronuclei
  by flow cytometry. Data represent the mean/SD of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05.
