caption: The circRNAs hsa_circ_0008521 and hsa_circ_0003848 are located on chromosome
  14, specifically in the genomic regions chr14:73614502-73614802 and chr14:73614502-73614814
  of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene respectively (A). Eight miRNAs were identified
  among databases commonly interacting with these circRNAs including hsa-miR-597-3p,
  hsa-miR-616-3p, has-miR-1972, has-miR-4279, hsa-miR-4668-5p, hsa-miR-4687-3p, hsa-miR-5584-5p,
  and hsa-miR-6755-3p (B,C). Further analysis revealed that two of these miRNAs, has-mir-4668-5p
  and has-mir-5584-5p (indicated with a red rectangle), exclusively interact with
  circPSEN1s and do not interact with mRNA-PSEN1 ((C) left). These two miRNAs mutually
  interact with 4135 mRNAs ((C) right). Moreover, pathway analysis showed that mRNAs
  involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are mainly targeted with each of miRNAs
  and their common targeted genes (D).
