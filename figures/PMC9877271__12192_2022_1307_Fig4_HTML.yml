caption: Effect of freezing, anoxia, and dehydration stresses on the relative expression
  of ATF6 pathway proteins (Inac ATF6, Act ATF6) in a liver and b muscle of wood frogs.
  Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4 independent biological replicates. Statistical testing
  used one-way ANOVA and Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test with p < 0.05 accepted
  as significant. *Significantly different from controls
