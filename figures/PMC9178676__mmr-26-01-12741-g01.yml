caption: Carnosol inhibits osteoclast function in vitro. (A) Assay of osteoclast pit
  formation and quantification of pit areas when BMMCs treated with different concentrations
  of carnosol. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B) F-actin ring structures of BMMCs and quantification
  of actin ring formation when treated with different concentrations of carnosol.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. (C) Western blotting was performed to analyze the protein expression
  levels of TRAP, cathepsin K and MMP-9 following treatment with carnosol. β-actin
  was used as the loading control. **P<0.01 vs. control. BMMCs, bone marrow monocytes;
  TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand.
article_title: Carnosol inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vivo and in vitro by blocking
  the RANKL-induced NF-κB signaling pathway.
