caption: 'Lithocholic acid (LCA) significantly inhibited intestinal epithelial cell
  proliferation in vitro. (A–C) IEC‐6 cells were treated with LCA, deoxycholic acid
  (DCA) or cholic acid (CA) at dose of 60–180 μM for 24 h, respectively, and cell
  proliferation was tested by CCK‐8 assay. (D,E) IEC‐6 cells were treated with LCA,
  DCA and CA at same dose of 60–160 μM for 24 h, and cell proliferation were tested
  by CCK‐8 assay. (F–H) Treatment of IEC‐6 cells with different doses of LCA (60–180 μM)
  for different times (6, 12 or 48 h), the cell proliferation was examined using CCK‐8
  assay. (I) The expression of PCNA in the presence of different dose of LCA (60–180 μM)
  for 6, 12 or 24 h was determined by western blot. (J) Immunofluorescence staining
  of Ki67 (Red) after treatment with 80, 120 and 160 μM LCA for 24 h (×400). Cells
  were counterstained with DAPI (blue). *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p <0.001 compared
  to control by one‐way ANOVA; ##p <0.01, ###p <0.001 compared to LCA by Student''s
  t‐test; ns, not significant. Data provided are the mean ± SD from at least three
  independent experiments, and bar graphs represent the mean with error bars indicating
  SD. CA, cholic acid; DCA, deoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid'
