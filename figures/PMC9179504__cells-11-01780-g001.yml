caption: 'sEVs promote the formation of an immunosuppressive environment. sEVs form
  an immunosuppressive environment by inhibiting immune cells, recruiting immunosuppressive
  cells, and combining with TAMs. sEVs inhibit immune cells by PD-L1 causing immune
  cells to lose the ability to recognize and clear tumor cells, interfering with monocyte
  differentiation, and inhibiting NK2D expression in normal NK cells. KRAS mutation
  leads to increased IL-8 production, neutrophil recruitment, and the formation of
  neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). CONDE-h promotes Th17 cell differentiation.
  The methods by which sEVs recruit immunosuppressive cells include: HSP72 induces
  STAT3-dependent immunosuppressive functions of MDSC, and S100A9 promotes G-MDSC
  proliferation. The methods by which sEVs combine with TAMs are as follows: miR-25-3p,
  miR-130b-3p, and miR-425-5p induce the M2 polarization of macrophages by activating
  the PI3K/AK signaling pathway, thereby promoting the CXCL12/CXCR4-induced liver
  metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRLM). Mir-934 induces the polarization of M2 macrophages
  by down-regulating PTEN expression and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway;
  thus, it forms a positive feedback loop of CXCL13/CXCR5/NFÎºB/P65/Mir-934 to promote
  CRLM. Explanation: MDSC: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, PD-L1: Programmed death-ligand
