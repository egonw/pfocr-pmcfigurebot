caption: 'Effect of fasudil on RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway activity and Cx43 expression
  in the diabetic retina. (A) The mRNA expression of RhoA, ROCK1, and Cx43 in retinal
  tissues from mice in the 12th week. (B) The mRNA expression of Cx43 at different
  time points (fourth week and twelfth week). (C, D) The protein expression of RhoA,
  ROCK1, ROCK2 and Cx43 in retinal tissues from mice in the twelfth week. ns, no significance.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 compared with the control group;
