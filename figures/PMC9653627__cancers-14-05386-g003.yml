caption: 'Proposed model for the role of Tau in regulating multicellular spheroid
  organization, growth, and migration via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in glioblastoma.
  Upper left panel: principle of cell evasion and cell junction in spheroid: in the
  zone (1), the N-cadherin junctions maintain cell-cell adhesion necessary for the
  wholeness of spheroid; in the zone (2), cells closed to the support leave spheroid
  to migrate individually (in red). Upper right panel: in the context of PTEN-null
  mutated cells, Tau could contribute by microtubule-dependent function to (1) stabilize
  the N-cadherin/β-catenin complexes in clusters to reinforce cell–cell adherens and
  to (2) promote the actin assembly required for cell contraction; Tau promotes indirectly
  activations cascade of the RTK/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (3), resulting in survival
  and proliferation of cells (4); also, active AKT may control the microtubule assembly
  by increasing Tau phosphorylation (5). Lower left panel: following the adhesion
  of cells to the support, the release of adherens junctions further promotes cell
  detachment from spheroid (1); this results in reduced assembly of actin and weak
  contraction of the cell (2), then low activation of the RTK/PI3K/AKT pathway (3);
  active AKT is regulating genes involved in cell migration (4), as well as Tau-promoted
  assembly of microtubules contributes to cell spreading. β-cat: β-catenin; α-cat:
  α-catenin; PIP2: phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5; PIP3: phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.'
