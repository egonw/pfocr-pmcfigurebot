figure_title: GCN5 overexpression accelerates pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy
  and dysfunction
caption: 'A–D Echocardiographic assessment of EF, FS, LVEDd, and LVESd values in GCN5-overexpressing
  mice and control mice subjected to sham or TAC surgery at 4 weeks (n = 10–12 mice/group).
  E–G HW/BW, HW/TL, and LW/BW ratios in GCN5-overexpressing mice and control mice
  subjected to sham or TAC surgery at 4 weeks (n = 10–12 mice/group). H Representative
  images of heart sections stained with H&E and WGA to analyze heart and cardiomyocyte
  size, respectively (n = 5 mice/group). I Representative images of heart sections
  stained with Masson’s trichrome stain to analyze perivascular and interstitial fibrotic
  area (n = 5 mice/group). J Effects of GCN5 overexpression on the mRNA levels of
  the hypertrophic marker genes and fibrotic marker genes in the hearts of mice subjected
  to sham or TAC surgery at 4 weeks (n = 5–7 mice/group, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs SHAM, #P < 0.05
  vs AAV9-Vector TAC 4 W, ##P < 0.01 vs AAV9-Vector TAC 4 W). Data are shown as the
  mean ± SD from three independent experiments.'
