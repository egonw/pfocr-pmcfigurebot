caption: 'LPS-induced inflammatory markers in plasma of delayed cohort. Panel A: A
  history of PB treatment elicits an increase in plasma TNF-α levels in response to
  LPS compared to vehicle-treated groups in the delayed cohort. Panel B: A history
  of PB treatment elicits an increase in plasma CINC-3 levels in response to LPS compared
  to vehicle-treated groups in the delayed cohort. Data in Panel A are expressed as
  mean percent change from saline treated controls from each respective group  SEM,
  n = 7–9. Data in Panel B are expressed as mean percent change from LPS-treated,
  vehicle non-stressed controls (NSC)  SEM as CINC-3 was not detected in saline treated
  animals, n = 6–8. [*: Significant effect of PB, p < 0.05].'
