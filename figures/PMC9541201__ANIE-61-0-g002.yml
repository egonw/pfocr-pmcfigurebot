caption: In vitro characterization of the functions of E. coli thiolases FadA, FadI,
  AtoB and YqeF. A) Proposed pathways for the synthesis of different α‐pyrones by
  thiolases from various starting substrates activated by ligases 4CL, BZL and FadD,
  and LC‐HRMS extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) of products from corresponding in
  vitro enzymatic reactions. The EICs of tetraacetic acid and diketide intermediates
  are shown in Figure S3. B) Exploring the substrate preference of thiolases FadA,
  FadI and AtoB by using 13C‐acetyl CoA, which was generated from 13C‐malonate using
  malonyl‐CoA synthetase (MatB) and malonyl‐CoA decarboxylase (MatA). The percentages
  show the relative ratios of the produced TAL having either two or fully labelled
  carbons.
