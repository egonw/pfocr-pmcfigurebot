caption: 'CellChat analysis between fibroblasts and epididymis epithelial cells. (a)
  Overview of pronounced ligand–receptor pairs in cell clusters. The thickness of
  the line represents ligand–receptor pair number. (b) Hierarchical plot representing
  the deductive cell communications for the IGF signaling pathway. (c) Violin plot
  displaying the expression of IGF1 signaling genes in each cell cluster. (d) Hierarchical
  plot showing the interactions for IGF1-IGF1R signaling. (e) Alluvial plot showing
  the incoming and outgoing signaling patterns of cell groups. The inferred outgoing
  communication patterns of secreting cells and incoming patterns of target cells
  suggest the correlation between the inferred potential cell groups, patterns, and
  signaling pathways. IGF1R: insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; DC: dendritic
  cell; IGF: insulin-like growth factor; ITGB: integrin subunit beta; VEGF: vascular
  endothelial growth factor; ANGPT: angiopoietin; GDNF: glial cell-derived neurotrophic
  factor; NGF: nerve growth factor; WNT: Wingless; BTLA: B and T lymphocyte associated;
  LIGHT: TNF superfamily member 14.'
