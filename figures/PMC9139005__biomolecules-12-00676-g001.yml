caption: 'Effects of chronic ethanol and dietary soy isolate on body growth and brain
  weight in male and female adolescent Long Evans rats. A four-way model was generated
  with 12 rats per group (6 male, 6 female): Control + Casein, Ethanol + Casein, Control
  + Soy, Ethanol + Soy. From 4-weeks of age, rats were maintained for 7 weeks on isocaloric
  Lieber–Decarli liquid diets containing 0% or 37% (3 weeks) followed by 26% (4 weeks)
  (caloric) ethanol and with casein (standard) or soy isolate (experimental) protein.
  Weekly body weights were measured to compare sex and ethanol effects with (A) casein
  or (B) soy as the dietary source of protein. (C) Heatmap comparisons of body weight
  changes over time for all groups showing consistently lower mean weights with female
  sex and ethanol-exposure, and increased body weight in soy compared with corresponding
  casein groups. (D) Area-under-curve body-weight calculations over the 7-week study
  confirming results in Panel C and showing soy’s protective effects in ethanol-fed
  males but not females relative to casein controls. (E,F) Brains were weighed at
  sacrifice. Mean brain weights were consistently lower in females. Dietary soy had
  a modest positive effect on brain weight in controls and a significant effect in
  ethanol-fed males but not females. Graphed data depict mean ± S.D. Results were
  analyzed by two-way ANOVA (see ) with post hoc Tukey tests [* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns = not significant].'
