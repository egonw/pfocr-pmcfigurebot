  AKT-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and PRAS40 activates mTORC1 in the presence
  of amino acids. mTORC1 signals to activate the transcription factor SREBP1. B, AKT-mediated
  phosphorylation of ACLY leads to increased cytosolic acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis
  (DNL). Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is used for acetyl-Lysine synthesis as a substrate for
  histone acetylation. C, AKT-mediated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 is required for GLUT4
  translocation, increasing glucose uptake. Increased glycolytic and TBC1D4 is required
  for GLUT4 translocation, increasing glucose uptake. Increased glycolytic and pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates bind and activate the transcription factor
  ChREBP.
