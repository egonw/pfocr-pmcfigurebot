caption: 'HD profoundly impacts on the circulating metabolome irrespective of COVID-19
  status. (A) Overview of the study design: participants were grouped according to
  COVID-19 status and severity (negative, mild/asymptomatic, moderate, and severe),
  and according to HD status (HD and non-HD). Targeted metabolomics was performed
  from plasma samples, and metabolites were compared between groups. (B) Principal
  component analysis of targeted metabolomics separated non-HD from HD patients along
  PC2, and more advanced disease stages along PC1. (C) A schematic overview of contrasts
  between groups is depicted. Double arrows indicate the respective contrast, and
  integers indicate the number of deregulated metabolites.'
