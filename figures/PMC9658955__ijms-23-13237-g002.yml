caption: 'Relationship between LMNA and the EMT-related gene between HCC827 and HCC827/ER
  cells. (A) Heatmap illustrating the expression of genes related to LMNA and EMT
  between HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. (B) An interaction network using the STRING
  online database and Cytoscape software for 22 common gene signatures involved in
  resistance to erlotinib and EMT mechanisms. (C) A total of 10 genes were identified
  as hub genes from 22 candidate genes using the CytoHubba tool in Cytoscape: LMNA,
  EGFR, PTEN, CDH1, CDH2, VIM, SNAI2, TWIST1, AKT1, and AKT2. (D) Relative expression
  levels of genes related to LMNA and EMT in HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells were confirmed
  by qPCR. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ** p< 0.001, *** p < 0.001. (E) The expression
  of laminA/C, laminB1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and snail was analyzed by
  Western blot in HCC827 and HCC827/ER cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control.'
