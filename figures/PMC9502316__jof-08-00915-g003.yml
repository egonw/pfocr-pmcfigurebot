caption: MoAde8 is required for growth, conidiation, and virulence. (A) Hyphae growth
  of Guy11, ∆Moade8, and ∆Moade8-C on CM and MM medium plates for 8 d. (B) The diameters
  of the colonies grown on the CM medium were measured at 8 days post-inoculation
  (dpi). Data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Asterisks are
  used to mark significant differences (** p < 0.01). (C) Deletion of MoAde8 led to
  increased melanin synthesis. Mycelium plugs of Guy11 and ∆Moade8 were cultured in
  CM liquid medium for 40 h. (D) Conidia were harvested from 8-day-old colonies and
  were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Asterisks are used to mark
  significant differences (** p < 0.01). (E) Conidiophores of Guy11, ΔMoade8, and
  ∆Moade8-C were induced in an incubator at 25 °C for 24 h and observed under an optical
  microscope. Scale bar, 50 μm. (F,G) Mycelium plugs of Guy11, ΔMoade8, and ∆Moade8-C
  were inoculated on detached barley (F) and rice (G) leaves. Photographs were taken
  at 4 dpi.
