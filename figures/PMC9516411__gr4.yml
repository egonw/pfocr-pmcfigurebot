caption: Increased gluconeogenesis genes are regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cattle. (A) The activation of mTORC1 in calf and
  pig liver tissues was monitored by measuring the phosphorylation of P70 ribosomal
  S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and S6. (B) Primary hepatocyte cells of cattle isolated and cultured
  for 4 h were observed under a microscope (OLYMPUS CKX53, Japan). (C) The primary
  hepatocyte cells of calf were treated with rapamycin for 24 h, and endogenous expression
  of FBP1, FBP2, PCK1, PCK2, PCCA, MMUT, and SUCLG2 genes was examined by RT-qPCR.
  Statistical significance was determined as the mean ± SEM. a, b Bars with a different
  letter mean a significant difference (P < 0.001). DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide.
