caption: RACGAP1 protein interacts with the EZH2 protein and increases the protein
  stability of EZH2. (A) Analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) information
  shows that RACGAP1 may directly interact with EZH2. (B) GSEA shows that high RACGAP1
  expression was enriched in the EZH2-TARGET pathway. (C) RNA levels of RACGAP1 and
  EZH2 in NE-like cells treated with RACGAP1 or empty vector (CON), as determined
  by qRT-PCR. (D) Western blot was performed to show protein expression of RACGAP1
  and E2F1 in NE-like cells following control, RACGAP1, RACGAP1 shRNA1 (sh1), or RACGAP1
  shRNA1 (sh2) transfection. (E) Total cell lysates of NE-like cells were immunoprecipitated
  with anti-EZH2 or anti-RACGAP1 antibodies and blotted with corresponding antibodies.
  (F) Representative immunofluorescence images of RACGAP1 and EZH2 protein localization
  in PC3 cells. (G) C4-2B-N cells and PC3 cells were transiently transfected with
  CON or RACGAP1 and supplied with 10 mmol/L cycloheximide (CHX), and then, total
  cell lysates were collected at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h after treatment. Western blot
  analysis was used to measure protein levels. (H) Protein expression analysis was
  used to calculate the half-life of EZH2 protein for C4-2B-N and PC3 cells. (I) Cells
  transiently transfected with RACGAP1 knockdown were treated with vehicle (DMSO),
  chloroquine (50 μm), or MG132 (20 μm) for 12 h. Western blotting was used to detect
  the protein level of RACGAP1. Bar graphs show the statistical analysis of three
  independent experiments. ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05, p = ns (no significance);
  t test for two groups or ANOVA for more than two groups.
