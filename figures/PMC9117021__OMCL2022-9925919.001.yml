caption: Apatinib induces loss of cell viability and promotes cell cycle arrest at
  G0/G1 phase. (a) CCK-8 assay showed the survival rate of U251 cells treated with
  apatinib for 24, 48, and 72 h. (b) CCK-8 assay indicated the survival rate of U87
  cells treated with apatinib for 24, 48, and 72 h. (c) Representative images of the
  morphology of U251 cells by an optical microscope. (d) Representative images of
  the morphology of U87 cells by an optical microscope. (e, f) Representative histograms
  of cell cycle analysis of U251 and U87 cells 72 h after the absence or presence
  of apatinib. (h)–(k) Quantitative analysis of cell cycle phases in U251 and U87
  cells 72 h after treatment with apatinib. (i, j) LDH levels in the supernatant of
  U251 and U87 cells without treatment and 72 h after treatment with apatinib 72 h.
  ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01.
