caption: MCG enhances co-localized immunoreactivities of Nrf2- and ChAT in the same
  hippocampal cells of GPx-1 KO mice. The representative photomicrograph of the double-labeling
  immunocytochemistry of Nrf2 and ChAT (A). Effects of MCG on aging-induced changes
  in Nrf2-IR (B), ChAT-IR (C), and co-localization of Nrf2 and ChAT (D). Each value
  represents the mean ± S.E.M. of 4 animals. ∗P < 0.01 vs. corresponding Saline. One-way
  ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the data.
