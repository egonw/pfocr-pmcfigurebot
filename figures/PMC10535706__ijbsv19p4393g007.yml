caption: 'Effect of A. muciniphila in AhR deficiency model. (A) Schematic diagram
  showing the infection of A. muciniphila in ApcMin/+ AhR -/- or ApcMin/+ mice. (B,
  C) Macroscopic images showing several polypoid and discoid colonic tumors in ApcMin/+
  AhR -/- or ApcMin/+ mice at 12 weeks after infection with A. muciniphila. Data from
  triplicate experiments are presented as mean ± SD. ANOVA test, **P < 0.01. (D, E)
  Number of intestinal polyps in the small intestine or colon in different groups.
  (F) Histology evaluation of colon tumors shown as polyps, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma.
  Data from triplicate experiments are presented as mean ± SD. ANOVA test, **P < 0.01.
  (G) Intestinal morphological changes were observed in mice fed with A. muciniphila,
  including reduced villi length and deeper crypt invaginations and analysed by representative
  H&E colon stainings. (H) Left: Trp and Kyn levels in the tumor tissue of ApcMin/+
  AhR -/- mice infected with or without A. muciniphila. Right: qRT-PCR for the expression
  of Trp transporters and enzymes in the tumor tissues of ApcMin/+ AhR -/- mice infected
  with or without A. muciniphila. (I) Left: Tumor tissue levels of Trp and Kyn in
  ApcMin/+ mice infected with or without A. muciniphila. Right: qRT-PCR for the expression
  of Trp transporters and enzymes in the tumor tissues of ApcMin/+ mice infected with
  or without A. muciniphila. Data from triplicate experiments are presented as mean
  ± SD, with Welch''s correction through one-tailed t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.'
