caption: CBX7 blocked the binding of Twist1 to EphA2 promoter and transcriptionally
  inhibited the expression of EphA2. Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cells were overexpressed
  with CBX7. (A) The levels of CBX7, Twist1 and EphA2 were detected by Western blot.
  (B) The schematic diagram showed the regulatory relationship between CBX7 and Twist1
  on the EphA2 promoter. (C) ChIP assay detected CBX7 binding to the E-box (CACGTG)
  on EphA2 promoter. (D) Dual luciferase reporter assay detected the binding of CBX7
  and Twist1 to EphA2 promoter. (E) We further constructed pGL3-WT-E-box-Luc and pGL3-Mut-E-box-Luc.
  Dual luciferase experiment s confirmed that E-Box sequence was indispensable for
  CBX7 and Twist1 competition. Data are the means Â± SD for three independent experiments.
