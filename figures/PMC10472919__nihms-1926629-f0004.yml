caption: 'Role of PLC-IP3pathway and ER calcium store in the [Ca2+]i responses of
  primary chondrocytes and ATDC5 cells under liquid drop stimulation and osmotic stress.
  Phospholipase C was inhibited by neomycin. ER calcium store was depleted by Thapsigargin.
  (A) The responsive percentage of cells. (B) Time to reach the 1st [Ca2+]i peak in
  the responsive cells. (C) Magnitude of the [Ca2+]i peak. (D) Relaxation time of
  [Ca2+]i peak. *: significant difference with the corresponding control (p < 0.05).
  Due to the low number of responsive cells in the ATDC5-osmo ER depletion group,
  no statistical analysis can be performed for spatiotemporal parameters.'
