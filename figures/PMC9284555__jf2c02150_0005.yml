caption: Concentration-dependent sulfation of EGCG by SULT1A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1E1.
  Different concentrations of EGCG were incubated with (A) SULT1A1, (B) SULT1A3, and
  (C) SULT1E1. EGCG-4″-sulfate formation was quantified using LC–MS. (D) Rate of sulfation
  of each SULT was compared at EGCG concentrations <3 μM. Data are presented as the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The kinetic curve at the lower concentrations
  is shown in Figure S5.
