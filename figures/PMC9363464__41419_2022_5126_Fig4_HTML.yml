figure_title: Loss of Keap1 increases the Nrf2 transcriptional activity, increase
  cancer stem cell characteristics, and predictor of chemotherapeutic outcome in patients
  with HNSCC
caption: 'A Cal33 cells were transfected with siRNA against Keap1, scrambled, and
  control for 96 h. Keap1 mRNA was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Results expressed
  as fold-change. B Cal33 cells were transfected as described in A and SOD1 mRNA was
  assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. C Cells were treated with Keap1 siRNA to knock
  down the Keap1 gene and assessed the cell viability 72 h after cisplatin treatment
  in the indicated concentrations in Cal33 cells. Data presented as mean SD of triplicate
  experiments. D Cell survival at 72 h after cisplatin treatment of indicated HNSCC
  patient’s primary tumor and HNSCC cell lines (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). E qRT-PCR
  analysis of Keap1 expression in control, Keap1 expressing SSC9 clone and parental
  SSC9 cells (***P < 0.001). F qRT-PCR analysis of Nrf2 target genes SOD1 and NQO1
  in control, Keap1 expressing clone, and parental SSC9 cells (***P < 0.001). G Cell
  proliferation activity of Keap1 expressing clone, control, and parental SSC9 cells.
  H Cell survival at 72 h after cisplatin treatment in parental SCC9, mock-transfected
  and Keap1-expressing clones. I Relative number of tumorspheres generated by the
  indicated patient’s tumor cells and cell lines. J Relative number of tumorspheres
  in parental SCC9, mock-transfected, and Keap1-expressing clone (**P < 0.01). K Expression
  of CD44 in cisplatin-resistant (n = 13) and cisplatin-sensitive (n = 11) HNSCC patients.
  L Summary of the results for the CD44 expression analysis in the presence of Keap1
  or Nrf2 mutations and/or Keap1 or Nrf2 protein expression in each case (n = 24).
  The number of aberrations in each case was represented as the aberration scores
  (0, 1, 2, and 3) and all 24 cases were assigned into two groups based on the aberration
  scores: a “high score group” (n = 13 as aberration score 2 and 3) and low score
  group (n = 11 as aberration score 1, and 0). M Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival
  curve for 24 patients was generated according to the aberration score. The high
  score group was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (Log-rank
  p < 0.0001).'
