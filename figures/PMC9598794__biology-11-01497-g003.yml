caption: ceRNA regulatory network construction and WGCNA between high and low IMF
  in crossbred pigs (Berkshire × AQSW). (A) Sankey diagram of the ceRNAs network in
  longissimus dorsi tissue. Each rectangle represents a gene, and the degree of connection
  of each gene is expressed based on the size of the rectangle. (B) GO and KEGG enrichment
  analysis of the five DE target genes in ceRNAs; (C) the mRNA expression of five
  DE target genes in longissimus dorsi tissue between high and low IMF. (D) Module–trait
  associations of longissimus dorsi tissue between high and low IMF. Each row corresponds
  to a module epigene, while each column corresponds to IMF. Each cell contains the
  corresponding correlation and p-value. The table is colour-coded by correlation
  according to the colour legend. The black solid box represents the significance
  of the modules associated with IMF. (E) The interaction network of FABP3 in the
  MElightyellow module of the IMF. The hub genes of PPAR signalling pathway and lipids
  metabolism in the modules are denoted by blue and red shadow. (F) Sequence alignment
