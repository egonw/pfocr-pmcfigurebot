figure_title: Complete confocal microscopy analyses of the individual point mutants
  of the cytoplasmic intracellular loop of IFITM3
caption: This figure presents the entire panel of confocal microscopy analyses (i.e.,
  IFITM3, GM130, and DAPI staining) of the mutants presented in , which for lack of
  space presents only IFITM3 staining panels. Source data are provided in the relevant
  section of .
article_title: A novel domain within the CIL regulates egress of IFITM3 from the Golgi
  and reveals a regulatory role of IFITM3 on the secretory pathway.
