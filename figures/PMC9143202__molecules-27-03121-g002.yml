caption: The fluorescence distribution of LC3 in MDBK cells after different concentrations
  of glucose stimulation. MDBK cells were treated with 5.5, 10.5, 15.5, and 25.5 mM
  glucose for 24 h, respectively. LC3 was labeled with red fluorescence by Cy3, and
  the nucleus was labeled with blue fluorescence by DAPI. Scale bar, 10 Âµm.
