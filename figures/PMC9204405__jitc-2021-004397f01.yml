caption: Mehanisms of immune modulation by HH/GLI signaling in cancer and inflammation.
  Cancer cell release CCL2/3 in response to oncogenic HH/GLI signaling, thereby recruiting
  TAMs and immunosuppressive MDSCs, 2. HH/GLI-induced PDL-1 expression in cancer and
  dendritic cells inhibits tumor specific cytotoxic T-cells via binding to PD-1. GLI,
  glioma-associated oncogene; HH, Hedgehog; MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells;
  TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; EMA, European
  Medicines Agency.
