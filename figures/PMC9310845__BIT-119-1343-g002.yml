caption: Schematic of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) N‐glycosylation pathway that occurs
  during mammalian cell culture and the possible stages at which heterogeneity can
  arise. (1) an immature precursor N‐glycan (three glucose, nine mannose, and two
  N‐acetylglucosamine residues, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is transferred from the dolichol
  phosphate anchor onto an asparagine (Asn) residue on the nascent mAb protein within
  an Asn‐X‐Ser/Thr, except Pro motif within the primary protein structure. (2) The
  three terminal Glc residues are further cleaved by a set of glucose specific glucosidases.
  (3) The immature N‐glycan is further trimmed to an immature Man8 N‐glycan structure.
  (4) The immature glycoprotein is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  to the Golgi apparatus (Golgi) via vesicular trafficking. Further trimming to a
  Man5 structure occurs in the Golgi. (5) β‐1,2‐N‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase I
  adds a GlcNAc residue to one of the terminal mannose residues. (6) Two terminal
  mannose residues are trimmed by ‐mannosidase II. (7) Another N‐acetylglucosyltransferase
  adds a GlcNAc residue onto the terminal mannose residue, followed by a fucosyltransferase
  adding a fucose sugar to the core GlcNAc. (8) Two galactose (Gal) residues are added
  to the two terminal GlcNAcs by specific galactosyltransferases. (9) Two sialic acid
  residues are added to the two terminal Gals by specific sialyltransferases and,
  finally, (10) the glycoprotein is encased in a vesicle, which buds off from the
  Golgi and travels towards the cell surface. There are about 100 glycosyltransferases
  and glucosidases involved in the processing and trimming of N‐glycans and other
  glycoconjugates. Most biosynthetic steps are precursor‐dependent, which gives rise
  to an immense variety of glycans described as heterogeneity. Created with BioRender.com
