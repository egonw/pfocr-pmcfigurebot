figure_title: Co-transfection of TSC-22 and BRD7 inhibits tumor cell proliferation
caption: SKOV3 cells transfected with control pcDNA4 or pcDNA-TSC-22 or/and pcDNA-BRD7
  were re-seeded in 100-mm cell culture dishes and incubated for 2 weeks to allow
  colony formation. The media were then removed, and colonies were stained with 5%
  crystal violet. The plates were rinsed with water, and the total colony numbers
  were counted. BRD7, bromodomain-containing protein 7; TSC-22, transforming stimulated
  clone 22.

  Protein 7 (BRD7) to Enhance the Inhibition of Extracellular Signal-Regulate Kinase
  (ERK) Pathway in Ovarian Cancer.
