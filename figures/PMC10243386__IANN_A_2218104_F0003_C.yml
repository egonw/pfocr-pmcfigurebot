caption: Distribution of somatic genetic alterations in patients with tumours of different
  stages or platinum sensitivity. (A) Frequencies of different alterations in patients
  of with stage I or any of stage II, III and IV disease. (B) Frequencies of pathways
  that carried ≥1 alteration in patients with stage I or stage II/III/IV disease.
  (C) Percentages of platinum-sensitive patients in all who harboured the indicated
  alteration. (D) Percentages of platinum-sensitive patients in all who harboured
  ≥1 aberrant gene participating in the indicated pathway.
