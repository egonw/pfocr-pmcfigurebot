caption: Schematic model of the proposed mechanisms of this study. Compared with LM
  breast cancer cells, the exosomes released by HM breast cancer cells are rich in
  EPHA2. Exosomal EPHA2 is delivered from HM breast cancer cells to endothelial cells
  and mediates activation of the Ephrin A1-EPHA2 forward signaling, which further
  activates the downstream AMPK-HIF-1Î± signaling pathway and promotes angiogenesis.
article_title: Exosomal EPHA2 derived from highly metastatic breast cancer cells promotes
  angiogenesis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway through Ephrin A1-EPHA2 forward
  signaling.
