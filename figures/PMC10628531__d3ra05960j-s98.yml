caption: Gan et al. discovered a facile strategy for the construction of benzimidazoles
  and 2-substituted benzimidazoles by the reaction between o-phenylenediamines and
  DMF derivatives. The imidazolium chloride-catalyzed cyclization reaction formed
  products in moderate to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (). A tentative
  reaction pathway was also suggested.
