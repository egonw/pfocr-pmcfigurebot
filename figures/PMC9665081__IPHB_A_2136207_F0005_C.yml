caption: 'Effect of veratramine on SIGMAR1 and its downstream regulatory proteins.
  (A) Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results of SIGMAR1 with NMDAR protein. (B) Statistical
  quantification map of band grey values in result A; (C) Co-IP results of CaMKII
  with NMDAR protein. (D) Statistical quantification map of band grey values in results
  C; (E) WB was used to detect the expression levels of NMDAR and its phosphorylated
  proteins. (F) Statistical quantification plot of grey values of WB bands. **p < 0.01,
  *p < 0.01, vs. vehicle group; ##p < 0.01, vs. model group.'
