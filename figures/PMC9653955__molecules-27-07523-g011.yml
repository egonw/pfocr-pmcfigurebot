caption: Quantitative PCR-based determination of the RNA steady state level in HTB75
  (a) and HTB161 (b) cell lines of members of DVL2 at 6 h of treatment with niraparib
  (at 6 or 25 µg/mL for HTB75 and HTB161, respectively), F7 (at 17.5 or 20 µg/mL for
  HTB75 and HTB161, respectively) or a combination of niraparib+F7 (6 + 17.5 and 25
  + 20 µg/mL for HTB75 and HTB161, respectively), relative to control. Gene transcript
  values were determined by quantitative PCR as a difference between the target gene
  versus a reference gene (HPRT). Values were calculated relative to the average expression
  of target genes in treated versus control using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Control was the
  vehicle control (1.00% v/v methanol + 0.60% v/v DMSO). Error bars indicate ± S.E.
  (n = 3). Levels with different Upper case letters with the same font and style were
  significantly different from all combinations of pairs by Tukey-Kramer honest significant
  difference (HSD; p ≤ 0.05). Representative examples of confocal images of HTB161
  (c–g) and HTB75 (h–l) non-induced (c,h), induced cell treated with vehicle control
  (0.6% methanol + 0.3% DMSO and 0.7% methanol + 0.88% DMSO respectively; (d,i), induced
  cells following treatment with niraparib (3 and 17.5 µg/mL respectively; (e,j) or
  F7 (3 and 14 µg/mL, respectively; (f,k) and niraparib+F7 (3 + 3 and 17.5 + 14 µg/mL,
  respectively; (g,l)). β-catenin was detected using β-catenin monoclonal antibody
  PE, REAfinity™ (red color) and nuclei, stained using EasyProbes™ Hoechst (blue stain);
  n = 3, in each biological replicate multiple cells, were examined. Bars denote 20
  µm. White arrows denote β-catenin signaling in cell membranes; yellow arrows denote
  spaces between cells in the monolayer.
