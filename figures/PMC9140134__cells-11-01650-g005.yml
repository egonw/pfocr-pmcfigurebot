caption: 'TNFR1 expression in pre-symptomatic APP/PS1 retina. (A) qPCR analysis of
  tnfr1 expression in the retina of TG APP/PS1 versus WT aged 3 months, p = 0.0004
  (WT n = 6:3F + 3M; TG n = 9:5F + 4M). (B) Representative western blot images and
  relevant quantification of TNFR1 protein expression in the retina of TG APP/PS1
  versus WT aged 3–4 months (WT n = 5:2F + 3M; TG n = 7:4F + 3M). (C) Representative
  image of the TNFR1 localization in the retina layers of TG APP/PS1 versus WT mice
  aged 3 months. (D) Quantification of TNFR1 positive nuclei in the retina of TG APP/PS1mice
  at 3 months (WT n = 4:4F; TG n = 3:3M). Immunofluorescence experiments: WT (n =
  4) and TG APP/PS1 (n = 3) aged 3 months. Results are expressed as mean +/− SEM.
  * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001.'
