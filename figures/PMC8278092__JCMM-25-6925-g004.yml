caption: LncRNAs may regulate JAK/STAT pathway through ceRNA mechanism. A, Scatterplot
  showed the differentially expressed miRNAs in psoriasis compared with the healthy
  group. Up‐regulated miRNAs are highlighted with red, while down‐regulated miRNAs
  are highlighted in blue. B, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the target genes
  of differentially expressed miRNAs in psoriasis compared with the healthy group.
  C, The sub‐network composed of lncRNA, microRNA and mRNA involve in IFN‐γ signalling
  pathway JAK/STAT signalling pathway. The network consists of 35 edges among 5 lncRNA
  nods, 29 miRNAs and 1 mRNA
