caption: An integral view of the cellular signal transduction pathway of SCFAs. Short-chain
  fatty acids (SCFAs) affect biological functions through two main pathways. They
  can bind G protein-coupled receptors on the surface of cell membranes (including
  GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109) to activate downstream NF-κB, MAPKs, and other signaling
  pathways. They can also enter cells through MCTs on the cell surface and participate
  in inhibiting HDACs or promoting HATs to regulate gene transcription. GPR, G protein-coupled
  receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MCTs,
  monocarboxylate transporters; HDACs, histone deacetylases; HATs, histone acetyltransferases
