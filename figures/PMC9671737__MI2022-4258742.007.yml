caption: ST3GAL3 promoted the inflammatory response of MH7A cells by activating the
  TLR9/MyD88 pathway. (a–d) ELISA results showed that transfection of MH7A cells with
  si-TLR9 reversed the effects of ST3GAL3 on MMP1, MMP3, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. (e–h)
  ELISA results showed that adding with CpG-ODNs reversed the effects of si-ST3GAL3
  on MMP1, MMP3, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. n = 3. ∗p < 0.05, ∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  compared with the indicated group.
