caption: 'Morin decreases LPS-induced cytoskeletal reorganization via a signaling
  pathway involving c-Src/Vav3/Rac1in OCs. BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/mL)
  and RANKL (40 ng/mL) for 96 h. Cells were washed with PBS and stimulated with LPS
  (50 ng/mL) ± morin (200 μM) or NAC (3 mM) in the presence or absence of M-CSF (30
  ng/mL) as indicated. As a control, BMM was loaded at the first lane. The cell lysate
  was immunoblotted for phosphorylated c-Src (Y416) after 5 min of exposure (A) or
  the indicated timepoints (B). The strong central band was calculated for phosphorylated
  c-Src. After 5 min of exposure, phosphorylation of Vav3 on tyrosine residue was
  detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Vav3 and anti-phosphorylated Tyr (C).
  GST pulldown and immunoblotting with Rac-specific antibodies were used to assess
  GTP-Rac (D). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001, *** p < 0.001 compared with vehicle; # p
  < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 compared with LPS-treated cells. Similar results were obtained
  in three independent experiments.'
