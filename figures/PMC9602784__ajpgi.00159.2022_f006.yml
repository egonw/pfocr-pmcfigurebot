caption: Schematic demonstrating that ACP induction with continuation of alcohol intake
  causes severe pancreatic atrophy and promotes fibroinflammatory milieu in mice,
  and withdrawal of alcohol promotes regression of pancreatic injury. Treatment with
  Uro A attenuates ACP disease severity despite continued alcohol intake in C57BL/6
  mice by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (Image created with Bio-Render
  with license agreement number WO249FGLAB). ACP, alcoholic chronic pancreatitis;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; Uro A, urolithin A.

  with continued alcohol intake by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
