caption: WNV infection reprograms host bioenergetics towards increased glycolysis
  in mouse neural tissues. A Experimental design and sample collection. Mice were
  intraperitoneally infected with 104 PFU of WNV and humanly euthanized at 7 days
  after infection (n = 6). Brain and cerebellum were harvested for transcriptomic
  analyses. Figure was created with BioRender. B WNV alters the transcriptomic profile
  in the CNS. Virus load was quantified in the brain and cerebellum hemisphere by
  RT-qPCR at 3, 7 and 10 days after infection. The changes in the number of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) with |FC|> = 2 and FDR corrected P < 0.05 are indicated.
  Upregulated denotes FC > 2 and downregulated FC < 2 over uninfected animals. C Assessment
  of immune cell activation and infiltration in the brain and the cerebellum of WNV-infected
  mice by using bulk RNA-seq expression data to estimate the abundance of cell types
  during the progress of WNV neuroinvasion with CellKb. D DEGs related to energy metabolism
  in the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and cerebellum of infected
  animals. The list of DEGs in WNV-infected tissues was filtered for genes available.
  Reactome pathways of glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle, pentose phosphate
  pathway and respiratory electron transport to identify energy-related DEGs. Heat
  maps indicate the fold change of identified DEGs at each time post-infection
