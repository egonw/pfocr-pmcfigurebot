caption: SMS2 inhibitor attenuates M2 polarization induced by CM of pancreatic cancer
  cells cultured in vitro. The conditioned medium of PANC-02 and PANC-1 was used to
  culture BMDM (A) and THP-1 (B) with or without YE2, respectively, and the cells
  were analyzed by immunoblotting after 48 h. The M2 polarization of BMDM (C) and
  THP-1 (D) was detected by Realtime PCR after 24 h. (E). Conditioned medium of THP-1
  and BMDM incubated in PDAC-CM with or without YE2 was collected to culture PANC-1
  and PANC-02 cells. Data is presented as the mean ± SD of three representative experiments.
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
