caption: The TLR4/NF‐κB signaling pathway regulates the expression of Nav1.7 in DRGs
  of SMIR rats. (a) Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing
  that NF‐κB protein expression was decreased in DRGs of SMIR rats with intrathecal
  injection of LPS‐RS (n = 3; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) compared with that in SMIR rats
  injected with saline; H3 served as a loading control. (b) Representative western
  blotting and corresponding graph showing that Nav1.7 expression was reduced in DRGs
  of SMIR rats with intrathecal injection of LPS‐RS (n = 3; *p < 0.05) compared with
  that in SMIR rats injected with saline; β‐actin served as a loading control. (c)
  Representative western blotting and corresponding graph showing that NF‐κB protein
  expression was decreased in DRGs of SMIR rats with intrathecal injection of PDTC
  (n = 3; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) compared with that in SMIR rats injected with saline;
  H3 served as a loading control. (d) Representative western blotting and corresponding
  graph showing that Nav1.7 expression was decreased in DRGs of SMIR rats with intrathecal
  injection of PDTC (n = 3; *p < 0.05) compared with that in SMIR rats injected with
  saline; β‐actin served as a loading control. Data were presented as means ± SD.
  Sham, rats underwent only skin incisions without muscle retraction. SMIR+saline,
  rats undergoing SMIR surgery were injected with saline. SMIR+LPS‐RS, rats undergoing
  SMIR surgery were injected with LPS‐RS. SMIR+PDTC, rats undergoing SMIR surgery
  were injected with PDTC. n = 3 rats per group. Statistical differences were determined
  by one‐way ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc tests. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
