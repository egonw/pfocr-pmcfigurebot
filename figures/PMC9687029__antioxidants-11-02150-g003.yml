caption: 'Transmission electron photomicrograph of hepatocytes showing: A1 and A2:
  Adult control hepatocytes with euchromatic nucleus, prominent Golgi apparatus and
  numerous elongated mitochondria. Abundant microvilli of hepatocytes are noted in
  the perisinusoidal space of Kupffer cells are also shown with their irregular dark
  nuclei. B1 and B2: Aged untreated hepatocytes showing irregular nuclei and rarefied
  cytoplasm with multiple vacuoles and lipid droplets. Hepatocytes nuclear degenerative
  changes are noted. Microvilli of hepatocytes are disrupted or lost. C1 and C2: VK2-treated
  aged group showing hepatocyte with regular nuclei, restored microvilli of hepatocytes
  and elongated normal mitochondria. N: nucleus, Tailed arrow: irregular nucleus,
  M: normal mitochondria, m: degenerated mitochondria, V: Cytoplasmic vacuoles, Arrows:
  microvilli, G: Golgi complex and Head arrows: lipid droplets.'
