caption: Primary cilia are dynamic, sensory organelles tasked with interpreting changes
  to and within the intra- and extracellular environments. Illustrative representation
  of the approximate composition and location of a generic eukaryotic cell and its
  intact primary cilium. On the apical surface of the cell, the primary cilium forms
  its axonemal portion as an extension of the plasma membrane protruding outward towards
  the extracellular environment. The ciliary axoneme is structurally supported within
  by the 9 + 0 microtubule scaffold that anchors the cilium to the body of the cell
  via the basal body complex, which is composed of both mother and daughter centrioles.
  Experimental modeling of cells, tissues, and diseases involving damage to or loss
  of primary cilia typically involve the genetic manipulation of genes and proteins
  critical for maintaining intraflagellar transport (IFT; protein + cargo) and/or
  kinesin-2-motor protein transport (protein + cargo). Elaboration of the cilium and
  maintenance of protein transport in the anterograde direction requires IFT Complex
  B proteins. Conversely, retrograde transport requires IFT Complex A proteins. In
  both directions, IFT proteins are acting as a scaffold to connect the respective
  motor complexes to the transported cargo components. Many receptors localize to
  the plasma membrane/ciliary membrane of the axoneme, the ciliary pockets and/or
  basal body region of the primary cilium complex, and can subsequently be affected,
  should genetic and/or environmental damage to the cilium occurs. The Hedgehog signaling
  pathway is closely associated with the primary cilium and serves as a critical regulator
  of mammalian development. Transduction of canonical Hedgehog signaling involves
  two co-receptors, Patched-1 (Ptch1) and Smoothed (SMO), both of which shuttle dynamically
  between the plasma membrane portion of ciliary axoneme itself and just outside of
  the base of the cilium. Hedgehog signal transduction leads to modification in the
  expression and protein activity of GLI gene family members encoding DNA-binding
  transcription factors (GLI 1-3). Size, length, and general structure of the cell/primary
  cilium illustrated above reflect a generalized example for illustrative purposes;
