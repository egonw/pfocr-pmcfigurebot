caption: 'Modulation of human urothelial lipid biosynthesis induced upon differentiation.
  (A) Gene expression plot comparison of three donor-matched cultures before [UD]
  and after [D] induction of the NHU differentiation protocol. Genes with gene ontology
  terms linked to lipid processing are shown as crosses, otherwise dots. Red crosses
  exhibit greater than doubling of expression in the differentiated cultures, and
  vice versa for the blue crosses, when corrected p values were less than 0.05. Genes
  of particular interest are indicated. (B) Lipid pathways enriched in differentiated
  (red) or undifferentiated (blue) states. Scaled enrichment score is equal to the
  GSEA normalised enrichment score multiplied by the reciprocal of the FDR. (C) Urothelial
  “sphingolipid rheostat” showing the upregulation of gene transcript upon differentiation
  where protein products deplete ceramide (CERA) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),
  likely increasing sphingosine (SPG) levels. Upregulated genes in red, downregulated
  in blue, partial upregulation in pink, no significant change in grey. Changing genes
  are named in (A). Metabolites in green. C1P: ceramide-1-phosphate; pPE: phosphoethanolamine.
  ACER2 hydrolysis of ceramides commonly produces sphingosine and stearic acid (18:0);
  the latter may explain the slight increase in 18:0 PC fatty acyl chains seen upon
  differentiation (D). (D) Same as the expression plot in (A) but highlighting genes
  from the Kennedy Pathway or Land’s Cycle only, naming those with statistically significant
  changes, highlighting the 5.37-fold upregulation of LPCAT4 upon differentiation
  (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p = 4.76 × 10−6). (E) RT-qPCR timecourse of LPCAT4
  expression upon differentiation [D] with values normalised to the undifferentiated
  [UD] 0 h levels. Error bars represent standard deviation from three technical replicates
  of a single NHU donor background.'
