caption: 'Signaling pathways of necrosis subtypes and apoptosis. Anterograde or retrograde
  orientations of the signaling pathway are indicated with blue or red arrows. Marker
  proteins for each necrosis subtype are shown in red letters. A similar cell signaling
  among subtypes is indicated with a black arrow. AIP: apoptosis-inducing factor,
  DEF: DNA fragmentation factor, CAD: caspase-activated DNase, MOMP: mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization, MPT: membrane permeability transition, PRR: pattern
  recognition receptor, NLR: nucleotide-binding domain and leucin-rich repeat, NLRP3:
  NLR family PYD domain containing protein 3, NLRP1: NLR family PYD domain containing
  protein 1, NLRC4: NLR family CARD domain containing protein 4, AIM2: absent-in-melanoma-2,
  ASC: apoptosis-associated speckle-like protein containing a CARD.'
