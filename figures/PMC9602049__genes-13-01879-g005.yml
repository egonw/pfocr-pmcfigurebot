caption: Regulatory networks of target genes of DEpiRNAs in the “Am4 vs. Am5” and
  “Am5 vs. Am6” comparison groups. (A) Regulatory network of DEpiRNAs and the corresponding
  targets relative to development-associated pathways. (B) Regulatory network of DEpiRNAs
  and the corresponding targets relative to immune-associated pathways. (C) Regulatory
  network of DEpiRNAs and the corresponding targets relative to energy metabolism-associated
  pathways. Only target gene ID and pathway names are presented while piRNA ID were
  omitted to make regulatory networks clearer. Purple circles indicate the target
  genes of DEpiRNAs in the “Am4 vs. Am5” comparison group, green circles indicate
  target genes of DEpiRNAs in the “Am5 vs. Am6” comparison group, while pink squares
  indicate signaling pathways.
