caption: 'Metabolomic pathways mainly altered on CH-PH and MCT-PH rats. IDO: Indoleamine
  2,3-Dioxygenase. TPH: Tryptophan hydroxylase. NOS: Nitric oxide synthase. Main impacted
  pathways in: (A) hypoxia rat model (A1: Arginine metabolic pathway, A2: Pyrimidine
  metabolic pathway, A3: Tryptophan metabolic pathway and A4: Purine metabolic pathway)
  and (B) MCT rat model (B1: Arginine metabolic pathway, B2: Pyrimidine metabolic
  pathway, B3: Tryptophan metabolic pathway and B4: Purine metabolic pathway). Green
  color: metabolites altered in both heart and plasma samples. Red color: metabolites
  altered only in heart samples. Blue color: metabolites altered only in plasma samples.'
