figure_title: Exogenous overexpression of MG53 inhibited the hepatocarcinogenesis
  in vivo
caption: To construct xenograft tumor model, 0.1 ml of 107 HUH7 cells were subcutaneously
  injected to both flanks of the nude mice (4-week-old male BALB/c nude mice, n = 8).
  When visible tumors appeared, the tumors at the left flanks were injected with Myc-MG53
  plasmid while tumors at the right flanks were injected with Myc-vector plasmid.
  The mice were sacrificed on day 26 after the first injection, and the tumors were
  separated from both flanks of the mice for further analysis. A, B The tumor growth
  curve (A) and the image of the isolated tumors from sacrificed mice (B) were presented.
  C, D The tumor volumes (C) and tumor weights (D) of the indicated groups were analyzed
  and compared. E qRT-PCR was performed to detect the relative MG53 expression level
  in MG53 and mock plasmid transfected group. F Protein extracted from the tumors
  was used for western blot assay to detect the expression levels of Myc, RAC1, p-JNK,
  p-P38 and p-ERK. G–J Another group of xenograft tumor model was constructed as the
  above described (4-week-old male BALB/c nude mice, n = 5 for indicated group). When
  visible tumors appeared, the tumors were divided into three groups including Myc-vector
  transfected group, Myc-MG53 transfected group and Myc-MG53-ΔRING transfected group.
  The tumors were injected with 20 μg of indicated plasmids every other day. The mice
  were sacrificed on day 28 after the first injection, and the tumors were separated
  from the nude mice for further analysis. The image of the isolated tumors from sacrificed
  mice was presented (G). H–J Western blot was performed to detect the successful
  transfection of the indicated groups (H). Tumor volumes (I) and tumor weights (J)
  of the indicated groups were analyzed and compared. K The working model showing
  the role and mechanism of MG53 in HCC cells. MG53 directly binds with RAC1 through
  its coiled-coil domain and further induces ubiquitous degradation of RAC1 by K48
  linked poly-ubiquitination, which leads to inhibition of the RAC1-MAPK pathway;
  and finally reverses the malignant behaviors of HCC cells and enhances the chemosensitivity
  of HCC cells to sorafenib. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 for statistical
  analysis of the indicated groups.
