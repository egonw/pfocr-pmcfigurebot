caption: Amyloid-β (Aβ) (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) in relation to each
  other in 76 participants with longitudinal Aβ positron emission tomography (PET),
  tau PET, and adjusted hippocampal volume (aHCV) data all available. (A) Baseline
  high tau PET and low aHCV were not associated with subsequent Aβ PET increase (ΔAb).
  (B) Baseline high Aβ PET but not low aHCV was associated with subsequent tau PET
  (Δ18F-flortaucipir [ΔFTP]). (C) Baseline high tau PET but not high Aβ PET was associated
  with subsequent aHCV decrease (ΔaHCV). The error bars indicate 95% confidence interval
  of the estimated β coefficient. HCV*FTP, Aβ*aHCV, and Aβ*FTP indicate the interaction
  between aHCV and FTP, Aβ and aHCV, and Aβ and FTP, respectively. *p < .05; **p <
  .01.
