caption: Effects of the leaf extract of MC on the cell morphological changes and nuclear
  fragmentation of HeLa cervical cancer cells and 3T3 fibroblast cells. (a) HeLa cells
  were treated with 125 μg/mL of MC extract for 24 h. (b) 3T3 fibroblast cells were
  treated with 125 μg/mL of MC extract for 24 h. Micrographs were taken at 0 and 24 h
  by a bright-field microscope (phase-contrast) and a fluorescent microscope to observe
  DNA fragmentation stained by DAPI (blue). Yellow arrow indicates DNA fragmentation,
  and the indicated cell is magnified in the right corner with yellow border. Data
  are representatives of three individual replicates.
