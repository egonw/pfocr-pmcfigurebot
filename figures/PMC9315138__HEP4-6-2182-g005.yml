caption: Interplay between HIF‐1 or TNF signaling pathway and OS‐9. (A,B) The expression
  of HIF‐1α in OS‐9 overexpression and control group was confirmed by western blot
  analysis. Results showed that OS‐9 overexpression induced up‐regulation of HIF1α
  expression with a ratio over 1.1 fold (p < 0.01). (C) Effects of OS‐9 overexpression
  group on cell migration capacity by Transwell assays in SMMC‐7721 cells. (D) Effects
  of OS‐9 overexpression group on cell invasion capacity. (E) Effects of OS‐9 overexpression
  group treated with HIF1α inhibitor (VH‐298, 20 μM) on cell migration capacity. (F)
  Effects of OS‐9 overexpression group treated with HIF1α inhibitor on cell invasion
  capacity. (G) Effects of OS‐9 overexpression group treated with TNFα inhibitor (Methylthiouracil,
  20 μM) on cell migration capacity. (H) Effects of OS‐9 overexpression group treated
  with TNF‐α inhibitor on cell invasion capacity. (I) Results from Transwell assay
  revealed a decreased migration or invasion capacity of OS‐9 overexpression treated
  with HIF‐1α or TNF‐α inhibitor in SMMC‐7721 cell lines (p < 0.001)
