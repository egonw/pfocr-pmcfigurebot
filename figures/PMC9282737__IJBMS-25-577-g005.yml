caption: 'H &E staining photomicrographs of the transverse section of ascending aorta
  tissues of various groups (10×) [Scale 50 μm]. Note: Normal alignment of the three
  tunics (L marked for Lumen, TI marked for Tunica intima [Red Arrow], TM marked for
  Tunica media, TA marked for Lumen Tunica adventitia. Plaque accumulation is presented
  by the black arrow. (A) Normal (sterile PBS ; Zymosan vehicle), (B) HFD (30 days)
  and Zymosan (80 mg/kg, single IP dose at day 8th), (C) HFD/Zymosan + anti-PCSK9
  mAb1 (6 mg/kg, s.c.), (D) HFD/Zymosan + anti-PCSK9 mAb1 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), (E) The
  percentage area of the atheromatous plaque was calculated (summation of the whole
  area of atheromatous plaque / whole area of slice) x 100. Image J software was used
  to determine atherosclerotic plaque area. ***P<0.001 versus normal group; ###P<0.001
  versus HFD + Zymosan group. Values in the graph are expressed as mean ± SEM (n=6,
  slides per group)'
