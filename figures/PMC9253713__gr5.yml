caption: YAP is essential for SUFU-mediated insensitivity to RSL3(A and B) Immunoblot
  (IB) analysis of AXL and ACSL4 levels in SUFU-depleted MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells
  upon YAP knockdown (A), and in SUFU-depleted HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated
  with verteporfin (B), a YAP-TEAD inhibitor. Numbers indicate the normalized ratio
  of AXL or ACSL4 over GAPDH signals obtained by densitometric analysis.(C) IB analysis
  of AXL and ACSL4 levels in SUFU-overexpressed HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon
  ectopic expression of Myc-tagged YAP5SA (constitutively active YAP) or Myc-tagged
  YAPS94A (inability to bind TEAD). Numbers indicate densitometric analysis.(D and
  E) Sensitivity to RSL3 (D), and GSH/GSSG ratios (E) of SUFU-depleted MCF-7 and T47D
  cells upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP.(F and G) Sensitivity to RSL3 (F), and
  GSH/GSSG ratios (G) of SUFU-overexpressed HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon ectopic
  expression of Myc-tagged YAP.(H) IB analysis of YAP expression in the indicated
  cells upon YAP knockdown or overexpression. GAPDH as a loading control. Data are
  presented as mean ± SD (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, Unpaired t test).
