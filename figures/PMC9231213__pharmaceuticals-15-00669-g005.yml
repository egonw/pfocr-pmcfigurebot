caption: Results of the secondary screen of a natural compound library (n = 66) against
  third-stage larvae N. brasiliensis with reference to quinidine as positive control
  (QND, 32 replicates per plate) and to DMSO 1% as negative control (DMSO, 32 replicates
  per plate). All test and positive control compounds were tested at 100 µM in the
  presence or absence of blood in duplicates. Each grey or red dot represents an individual
  test compound. Mean +/− SD for controls were calculated as an average of all replicates
  (n = 224) and are indicated in purple for DMSO. All values were normalised for each
  plate to mean (DMSO) + 3 ∗ SD(DMSO) = 10,000 units (Dashed black line). Red dots
  are compounds identified as hits in presence of blood (39 compounds, screen 2, as
  described in ). (a) Normalised fluorescence intensity obtained for each of the 66
  hits in absence of blood. (b) For each of the 66 compounds, the fold change of Sytox
  green intensity between screen 2 (in presence of blood) and screen 3 (in absence
  of blood) is represented as a function of the Sytox intensity as compared to the
  reference drug quinidine in presence of blood. The dash grey line has been set manually
  to separate hits with the higher fold change between absence and presence of blood.
