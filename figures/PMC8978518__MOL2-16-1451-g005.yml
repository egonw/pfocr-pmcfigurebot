caption: 'HEMO activation in tumors is linked to epidermis and immune‐related signatures.
  (A) GSEA (Gene Ontology Biological Process and REACTOME) pathway distribution for
  HEMOHigh vs HEMOLow tumors in TCGA cohorts. Of note, for each cohort, these two
  groups displayed similar tumor cellularity. Immune response‐ and epidermis‐related
  gene sets are, respectively, demarcated as blue and orange dots. NES: Normalized
  Enrichment Score. (B) List of epidermis‐related gene sets shared by six cohorts
  (absence of such gene sets in the COAD cohort). (C) Top: Endometrium adenocarcinoma
  sample stained with CK5/6 (left) or HEMO (brown) and p63 (pink) (right), magnification:
  15×, scale bar: 100 μm. Middle: pairs of HES and anti‐HEMO staining in differentiated
  squamous tumors of breast, endometrium, Head and Neck with peculiar localization
  of HEMO in squamous pearls and esophagus. Bottom: pairs of HES and anti‐HEMO staining
  in normal tissue of exocervix and skin. Magnification: 10×, scale bar: 100 μm. When
  specified, numbers correspond to samples analyzed in Fig. . (D) List of immune‐related
  gene sets shared by 6 or 7 cohorts. (E) Heatmap displaying differential expression
  between HEMOHigh and HEMOLow tumors, of immune‐related genes belonging to ‘T‐cell
  (Treg and CD8)’, ‘Regulation of immune response’ and ‘Type I interferon response’
  signatures established by []. PDCD1 was also added on this figure. Color gradation
  is representative of Log2 fold change.'
