caption: Pygo2 regulates adipocyte differentiation and interacts with the Axin2/GSK3β
  pathway in the CD context. The 3 T3‐L1 cells (8–10 d after differentiation) were
  infected with lentiviruses to mediate si‐Pygo2 and Pygo2 overexpression (OE‐Pygo2)
  and stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL). The efficiency of knockdown and overexpression
  was verified by Western blotting at 14 d after differentiation (A). The cells were
  fixed and stained with Oil red O, and the representative image was shown (B). Total
  and nuclear proteins were then extracted from the cells, and Western blot analysis
  of Perilipin was performed (C). Western blot analysis of PPARγ and C/EBPα (D), as
  well as Axin2 and GSK3β (E), in total MAT protein. Western blot analysis of GSK3β
  in the nucleus in MAT (F). Relative intensities of the proteins (G‐I). PPARγ, peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor γ; C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)
  alpha; Axin2, Axis inhibition protein 2; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.
  The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05.
