caption: 'Effects of COG1410 on the histopathological damage and BWC at 72 h after
  cerebral I/R. (a) HE staining of hippocampal CA1 area (×400), scale bar = 20 μm;
  the arrows indicate injured neurons. (b) Quantitative analysis of normal neurons
  in the hippocampal CA1 area. (c) BWC. Data were represented as mean ± SEM (n = 8).
