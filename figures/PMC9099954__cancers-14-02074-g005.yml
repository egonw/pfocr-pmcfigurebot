caption: GATA5 overexpression suppresses PCa cell growth in vivo. (A) The tumor models
  in the pc-GATA5 group were much smaller when compared with the pc-vector group.
  (B) The tumors volume at each specific time point was calculated, and the results
  demonstrated that both the tumor growth rate and size in the pc-GATA5 group were
  smaller than those in the pc-vector group. (C,D) Immunohistochemistry was implemented
  to assess the expression of Ki67 in tumors. (E) Overexpression of GATA5 promoted
  prostate cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. Data are presented as mean Â± SD of at least
  three experiments. ** p < 0.01.
