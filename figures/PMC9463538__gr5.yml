caption: ERBB2 does not compensate for effects of reduced IGF1R/IR signaling on Akt
  or ERK phosphorylation in TSKIcells.A, increased phosphorylation and expression
  of ERRB2 in TS cells lacking MAP3K4 kinase activity. B, densitometry analyses are
  shown. C, increased Erbb2 transcript in TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells. Quantitative
  PCR (qPCR) data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold change relative to TSWT
  cells and are the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent experiments. D, reduced
  Erbb2 expression through Erbb2 shRNA knockdown in TSKI cells with 3 independent
  shRNAs, Esh1, Esh2, and Esh3. qPCR data normalized to Rps11 are expressed as a fold
  change relative to TSKI cells and are the mean ± SD of 3 biologically independent
  experiments. E, Erbb2 shRNA knockdown in TSKI cells does not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
  F, densitometry analyses normalizing phosphorylated ERK1/2 to total ERK2 protein.
  G–J, cells were treated with either vehicle control (DMSO) or 1 μM lapatinib for
  48 h. Inhibition of ERBB2 with lapatinib does not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  or Akt phosphorylation. H, densitometry analyses normalized phosphorylated ERK1/2
  to total ERK2 protein. J, densitometry analyses normalized phosphorylated Akt to
  Akt1. K, Erbb2 shRNA knockdown or ERBB2 inhibition with lapatinib does not significantly
  affect cellular doubling time. A, E, G, and I, images are representative of 3 biologically
  independent experiments. B, F, H, and J, data shown are the mean ± SD of densitometry
  analyses of 3 biologically independent experiments. ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001;
