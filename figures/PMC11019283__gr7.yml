caption: 'Bile acid (BA), which is an important functional component in Pien Tze Huang
  (PZH), regulates activation of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5)-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-A20 signalling pathway. (A)
  Total BA levels were detected in the PZH solution and PZH plus cholestyramine resin.
  (B) Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of PZH supernatant
  treated with or without cholestyramine resin. (C) Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated
  with PZH (1.25 mg/mL) or cholestyramine resin-treated PZH (1.25 mg/mL) for 2 h,
  and then treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/mL) for 40 min. PZH treated
  with cholestyramine resin did not increase the protein expression of TGR5, phospho-STAT3
  (p-STAT3) and A20 or decrease the protein expression of phospho-p65 (p-p65), phospho-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), and phosphor-C-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK)
  induced by LPS. (D) Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with PZH (1.25 mg/mL)
  or cholestyramine resin-treated PZH (1.25 mg/mL) for 2 h and then treated with LPS
  (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. PZH treated with cholestyramine resin did not decrease the
  mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β induced
  by LPS. (E) The composition of BAs in the PZH solution was detected by LC-MS. (F)
  Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with PZH (1.25 mg/mL), cholestyramine resin-treated
  PZH (1.25 mg/mL), and cholestyramine resin-treated PZH (1.25 mg/mL) + BAs for 2
  h, respectively, and then treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 6 h. Replenishing BAs
  including cholic acid (CA) (61.53 μM), deoxycholic acid (DCA) (27.25 μM), chenodexycholic
  acid (9.75 μM), taurocholic acid (TCA) (20.52 μM), glycocholic acid (GCA) (7.466
  μM) and lithocholic acid (LCA) (0.413 μM) in PZH after treatment with cholestyramine
  resin decreased the mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β induced by LPS. (G) Peritoneal
  macrophages were pretreated with PZH (1.25 mg/mL), cholestyramine resin-treated
  PZH (1.25 mg/mL), and cholestyramine resin-treated PZH (1.25 mg/mL) + BAs for 2
  h and then treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 40 min. Replenishing BAs including CA
  (61.53 μM), DCA (27.25 μM), chenodexycholic acid (9.75 μM), TCA (20.52 μM), GCA
  (7.466 μM) and LCA (0.413 μM) in PZH after treatment with cholestyramine resin decreased
  the expression of p-p65 and p-ERK induced by LPS. (H) Schematic model of the mechanism
  by which PZH attenuates the LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating TGR5-STAT3-A20
  signalling pathway. PZH stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT3, which acts as a
  transcriptional activator for A20 to increase the expression of A20. A20 inhibits
  the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways to decrease the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines to attenuate the sepsis progression. The results are representative of
  one of three experiments. The data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
