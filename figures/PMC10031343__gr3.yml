caption: 'CDDP protects ApoE–/–LDLR–/– mice against HFD-induced heart injury by inactivating
  Wnt pathway. Heart tissues of wild type (WT) mice, HFD-fed (Ctrl) and HFD-fed plus
  CDDP treated (CDDP) ApoE–/–LDLR–/– mice (3 mice/group) in  were conducted RNA-seq
  analysis. (A) The volcano plot shows the genes expressing differently between Ctrl
  and WT or CDDP and Ctrl. Significantly different expression genes (DEGs) were defined
  by threshold (P < 0.05) and [log2 (Fold Change/FC) > 1]. Upregulated genes were
  marked in red and downregulated genes in blue. (B) Venn diagram shows comparison
  of DEGs between Ctrl and WT or CDDP and Ctrl group, and 87 DEGs were overlapped.
  (C) Among the 87 DEGs, 70 of them were reversed by CDDP treatment. (D) The reversible
  70 DEGs were classified by GO enrichment analysis. (E) Heatmap shows expression
  profiles of the reversible DEGs related to Wnt signaling pathway. (F) Protein expression
  of BMP3, WIF1, SFRP5, SFRP4, NKD1, DKK2, β-catenin was determined by Western blot.
  (G) mRNA levels of Bmp3, Wif1, Sfrp5, Sfrp4, Nkd1, Dkk2 were determined by qRT-PCR
  (n = 5). The data are shown as mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001;
  #P < 0.05; ns: not significantly different between indicated groups. GO: gene ontology.'
