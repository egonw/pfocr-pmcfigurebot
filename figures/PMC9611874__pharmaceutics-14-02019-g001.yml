caption: A cross-species comparison of the importance of progesterone (P4) for pregnancy
  and parturition. (a) In mice and women, sustained increasing production of progesterone
  (P4) from the corpus luteum of the ovary is essential to establish and maintain
  pregnancy. P4 production in women shifts to the placenta in the first trimester
  of pregnancy. Most physiological effects of P4 are mediated by two classic genomic
  nuclear progesterone receptor isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, respectively. (b) P4 declines
  in the circulation just before labor in prepartum mice. This period comes after
  the cervix ripens while P4 concentrations are near or at peak []. (c) In prepartum
  women, P4 remains near peak or increases in the circulation until birth occurs.
  Thus, cervix ripening and labor reflect a functional withdrawal of the effects of
  P4 for parturition in women, while in mice there appears to be a functional loss
  of response to P4 for ripening of the cervix followed by an actual loss of P4 for
  labor and birth. Adapted from “Molecular Pathway and Mouse Phenotype (Layout)”,
