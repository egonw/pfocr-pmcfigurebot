caption: Schematic diagram of regulatory axis of testicular steroidogenesis. Sex steroids
  (predominantly testosterone) are produced upon central gonadotropin-releasing hormone
  (GnRH)—luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. LH binds to LH receptors on Leydig
  cells in the testicle and activates the pathway for the synthesis of steroid hormones
  from cholesterol. Different pathways variants are available after conversion to
  pregnenolone (Δ4 and Δ5). Normal, adult testicular steroidogenesis in men follows
  steroidal pathway Δ5, with a little amount of testosterone generated via the Δ4
  pathway. Small amount of testosterone and androstendione are converted in the Leydig
  cells to estrogens by enzyme aromatase (CYP19A1) and to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
  by 5α-reductase. Testosterone and estradiol act locally in testicle to regulate
  its function (e.g., spermatogenesis) or are released to blood circulation. Circulating
  sex steroids form a negative feedback loop to inhibit the secretion of GnRH and
  LH.
