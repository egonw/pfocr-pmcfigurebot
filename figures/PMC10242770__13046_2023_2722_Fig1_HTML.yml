caption: 'p38 suppression reversed long term TS exposure-triggered CSC-like properties.
  Mice exposed to TS were treated with or without p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) for
  12 weeks, and representative micrographs of liver tissue were stained with H&E (a).
  b Immunohistochemical staining for EpCAM, CD133 and Nanog, Oct4 in liver tissues.
  c-f Fold changes of EpCAM (c), CD133 (d), Nanog (e) and Oct4 (f)—positive area in
  TS group compared with FA group. g Western blotting of EpCAM and CD133 in liver
  tissues. β-actin was served as the loading control. h-i The indicated proteins relative
  to β-actin were assessed by densitometric analysis; six animal samples per group
  were used for the densitometric analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. The significance
  was assessed with one-way ANOVA test. # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01, compared with FA
  control; * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, compared with TS + DMSO group. FA = filtered air;
  TS = tobacco smoke'
