caption: Enriched KEGG genes according to bacteria associated with midgut naturally
  infected with ZIKV in Colombian Ae. aegypti. This Sankey visualizes KEGG pathway
  groups’ significance (p < 0.05) with ANCOM-BC analysis. The numerical value shows
  PICRUSt2 gene counts corresponding with taxonomy at the genus level. This chart
  shows the top 20 KEGGs per category by count. For an interactive view, visit https://observablehq.com/d/cd9c60c5c86289ce
