caption: 'Expression of receptors targeted by anlotinib, CS2164 and RAD001 in H69S
  cells and H69A cells. H69A and H69S cells were collected. (A) Reverse-transcription
  quantitative PCR analysis of VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, c-Kit, Aurora B and CSF1R mRNA
  levels were assessed using the 2-ΔΔCq method. (B) Phosphorylated mTOR/mTOR were
  tested by using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the internal standard. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of (B): H69A was the control (100%). Data are presented as the mean ± the
  SD of three independent experiments. *P<0.05. VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; FGFR, fibroblast
  growth factor receptors; c-Kit, stem cell factor receptor; CSF1R, colony-stimulating
  factor 1 receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; p-, phosphorylated.'
