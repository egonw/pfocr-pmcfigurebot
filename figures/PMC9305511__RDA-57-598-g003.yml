caption: The transcription levels (mean + SD) of (a, d) the hyaluronan synthase 1
  (HAS 1), (b, e) hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS 2) and (c, f) hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS
  3) in the mares' endometrium in follicular (FLP) or mid‐luteal (MLP) phases of the
  oestrous cycle evaluated with respect to the intensity of inflammatory cell infiltrate
  (none, mild, moderate and severe) are shown in graphs a, b and c, and according
  to the type of inflammatory cell infiltration (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes
  and mixed cells) or no cell infiltration detected (none) in d, e and f. Different
  letters indicate differences between groups for the same oestrous cycle phase (p < .05).
  The asterisk indicates differences between phases of oestrous cycle (*p < .05)
article_title: The NF‐κB‐signalling pathway in mare's endometrium infiltrated with
  the inflammatory cells.
