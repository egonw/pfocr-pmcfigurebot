figure_title: Single-cell proteomics provides insight into cellular response to drug
  treatment
caption: a A PCA plot demonstrating PC1 (6.5%) and PC2 (2.9%) of proteins from single
  control and sotorasib-treated cells. b The measured abundance of TOP2A protein expression
  in 230 single cells. c The top pathways identified as differential by a scSeq analysis
  of drug treatment combined demonstrates the strengthening of each pathway when SCP
  data is added. Source data are provided as a Source data file.
