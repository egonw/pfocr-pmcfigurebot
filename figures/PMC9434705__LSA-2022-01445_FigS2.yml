figure_title: Mutant BRAF melanoma cells resistant to PLX4032 cells rewire ERK and
  MST2 pathways
caption: (A) Parental (P) A375, SK-Mel28, and WM-793 cells clones (R) grown without
  PLX4032 for 48 h were treated with PLX4032 (3 μM) for 1 h and ERK activation was
  determined by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) Cells were grown
  in 3 μM PLX4032, and live cells were counted at the indicated time points using
  a cell cytometer. (C) Parental and resistant cells were lysed and the endogenous
  BRAF was immunoprecipitated. BRAF interaction with ARAF and RAF1 was determined
  by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (D) Parental and PLX4032 resistant
  A375 cells were treated with PLX4032 (3 μM) and/or trametinib (10 nM) for 1 h. Cell
  extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (E) A375 parental and
  resistant cell extract were incubated with BRAF or isogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG).
  Cell extract (TL) IPs were blotted with the indicated. The blots show a spliced
  image from the same gel. (F) Parental (P) and resistant SK-MEL28 (left) and WM-793
  (right) (R) cells were lysed and cell extracts were incubated with PathScan RTK
  Signaling Antibody Arrays. Red boxes show differentially regulated proteins. In
  all blots, numbers indicate molecular weight (kD).Source data are available for
  this figure.
