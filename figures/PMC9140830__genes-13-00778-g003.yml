caption: Genes identified by recurrence, conservation, and synVep prediction are more
  likely to be involved in cancer. The four categories of genes are identified by
  the filters (X-axis) as described in text. Y-axis represents the fraction of the
  selected category genes that are found in (A) Cancer Gene Census, (B) KEGG cancer
  pathway genes, and (C) DO cancer genes. Numbers on top of each bar in panel A show
  the number genes of each category.
