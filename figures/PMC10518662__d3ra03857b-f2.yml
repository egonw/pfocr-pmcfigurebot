  fragmentation fluid precipitation of GP pathway; 3 represents the cell fragmentation
  supernatant of XP pathway; 4 represents cell fragmentation fluid precipitation of
  XP pathway; 5 represents the cell fragmentation supernatant of AP pathway; 6 represents
  cell fragmentation fluid precipitation of AP pathway; 7 represents cell fragmentation
  fluid precipitation of empty bacterium; and 8 represents the cell fragmentation
  supernatant of empty bacterium. (B) Results of NMN production from three pathways
  in vivo'
