caption: ANXA5 alleviated intestinal inflammatory response after TBI. (A–D) ELISA
  results showed that ANXA5 decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6,
  but increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the intestine on day 2 after
  TBI (n = 6 mice/group). (E–H) ANXA5 decreased the numbers of MPO-positive and COX-2-positive
  cells (in red) in the intestine on day 2 after TBI. Insets show merged images of
  MPO and COX-2 staining with DAPI-stained nuclei (scale bar = 100 μm, n = 6 mice/group).
  (I,J) Western blotting showed that ANXA5 treatment significantly reduced the expression
  of COX-2 (n = 6 mice/group). Data are shown as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
