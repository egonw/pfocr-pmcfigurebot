  cancer
caption: A, B Cancer cell-DRG coculture model for the NC and sh Met groups in PANC-1
  cells and BxPC-3 cells. C, D Western blot analysis of the expression of c-Met, N-cadherin,
  E-cadherin, Vimentin, and NGF in the wild-type, NC, sh Met-1, and sh Met-2 groups
  in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. E, F Wound healing assay of the NC and sh Met
  groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. G, H Transwell-based assay of the NC and
  sh Met groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.
