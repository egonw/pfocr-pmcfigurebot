caption: Effects of tapinarof treatment on SLE‐related immune cells. (A) Representative
  FACS pseudo‐color plots show Treg cell populations (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) in spleens
  and lymph node cells. The results of the statistical analysis are shown on the right
  (n = 6–10). (B) Representative FACS pseudo‐color plots for Th1 (CD4+IFN‐γ+) and
  Th2 cells (CD4+IL‐4+) (left) and the ratio of Th1/Th2 cells (right) (n = 6–7). (C)
  The histogram shows the concentrations of Th1/Th2/Th17‐related cytokines in the
  plasma in each study group (n = 6–10). The data were obtained from two independent
  experiments. Error bars indicate SD; *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001. SLE,
  systemic lupus erythematosus.
