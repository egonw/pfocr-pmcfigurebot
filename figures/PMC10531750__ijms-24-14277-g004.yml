caption: 'Up. Delivery of miRNAs into the bloodstream is facilitated during STEMI
  as a response to impaired cardiomyocytes. These cells release circulating miRNAs
  via protein complexes, microvesicles, exosomes, apoptotic bodies, and/or mesenchymal
  stem cells, resulting in the upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs. Down. These
  miRNAs, particularly downregulated miRNAs, may serve as a diagnostic, prognostic,
  and therapeutic pathway for patients with STEMI. Abbreviations: ST, ST Segment;
  ECG, electrocardiogram; ACS, acute coronary syndrome; STEMI, ST-segment elevation
  myocardial infarction; RNA, ribonucleic acid; miRNAs, microRNAs; MSCs, mesenchymal
  stem cells. From Tanase DM et al. Life (Basel). [] and Scărlătescu AI et al. Int
  J Mol Sci. [].'
