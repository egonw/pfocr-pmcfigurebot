caption: (A) Represented normal liver architecture of VC group. Black arrowhead in
  injury groups at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W indicating vacuolation, pyknotic nuclei, necrosis,
  and sinusoid dilations respectively (20X microphotographs). (B&C) The serum ALT
  and AST level significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001) increased
  at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W injury groups compared to VC groups. (D&E) mRNA expression
  of Alb and Krt18 showing significant (p < 0.0001) downregulation in injury group
  at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared to VC groups. The graphical data presented in mean ± S.D.
