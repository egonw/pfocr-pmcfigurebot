caption: TMEM44‐AS1 mainly existed in cytoplasm in GC cells and was indicative of
  poor outcome. A) PCR products from rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The
  products (indicated by arrows) of 5′ and 3′‐RACE were obtained by nested PCR and
  then sequenced. 5′‐ or 3′‐sequences of the TMEM44‐AS1 transcript are marked. B)
  Prediction of protein coding potential of TMEM44‐AS1 from LNCipedia (http://www.lncipedia.org).
  C) Diagram of TMEM44‐AS1 secondary structure prediction (RNAfold web server). D,E)
  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and subcellular fractionation assays showing
  the main localization of TMEM44‐AS1 within GC cell cytoplasm. 18S/GAPDH and U6 served
  as cytoplasmic and nuclear controls, respectively. Scale bar, 10 µm. F) Comparison
  of differences in TMEM44‐AS1 expression levels within GC tissues between non‐recurrence
  (n = 74) and recurrence (n = 38) cases. G) OS and H) DFS in GC cases (n = 112) showing
  different levels of TMEM44‐AS1 expression in their tumors. Data are mean ± SD, n
  = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
