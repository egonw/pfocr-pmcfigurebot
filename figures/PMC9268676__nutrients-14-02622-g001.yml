caption: Mechanisms in terms of apoptosis and autophagy induction by the active ingredients
  of edible and medicinal fungi. Reduced fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes leads
  to the induction of autophagy by Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides through MAPK/ERK
  pathway. Grifola frondosa polysaccharides-incubated breast cancer cells exhibit
  an increased level of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, and a decreased expression of Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL. β-(1→3)-D-glucan with short branches inhibits the growth and induces
  the apoptosis of HCC cell line H22 by increasing caspase-3/9 levels and decreasing
  VEGF and CD31 levels.
