caption: AZD1775 response, senescence, and UPR are functionally related in clinical
  datasets of ovarian cancer. A) the bubble chart shows the correlation coefficient
  between AZD1775‐induced top 200 differential genes (AZD_TOP_200) and pathways of
  UPR, PERK, and XBP1s in 13 different human ovarian cancer cohorts using the Pearson
  correlation test. B–D) Representative correlational plots of AZD_TOP_200 with Hallmark
  UPR pathway B), PERK pathway C), and XBP1s pathway D) in three independent ovarian
  cancer datasets. E) The bubble chart shows the correlation coefficient between AZD_TOP_200
  and senescence signatures (Hernandes_Segura.UP (Senescence Up) and Hernandes_Segura.Down
  (Senescence Down)) in various ovarian cancer datasets using the Pearson correlation
  test. F,G) Representative correlational plots of AZD_TOP_200 with senescence up
  F) and senescence down G) in three independent ovarian cancer datasets. H) The bubble
  chart shows the correlation coefficient between AZD1775‐induced senescence genes
  (AZD‐induced senescence genes) and pathways of PERK and XBP1s in 13 human ovarian
  cancer cohorts using the Pearson correlation test. I,J) Representative correlational
  plots of AZD‐induced senescence genes with PERK pathway I) and XBP1s pathway J)
  in three independent ovarian cancer datasets.
