caption: (a) PPI network of emodin targets. (b) PPI network of disease targets. The
  red and green dots represent the targets of ischemic stroke and emodin, respectively.
  (c,d) PPI network of intersection targets. The PPI network was constructed through
  the String website, and the top 10 core targets were obtained through the MCC algorithm
  of cytoHubba plug-in of Cytoscape. (e) Alluvial map of emodin signaling pathway
  in ischemic stroke.
