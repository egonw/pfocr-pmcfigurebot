figure_title: Intracellular innate immune response to avian influenza
caption: Antiviral interferon stimulated genes (ISGs, purple) are produced through
  a cascade of intracellular signaling processes (signaling molecules are in red)
  known as the interferon pathway. Pattern recognition receptors (dark blue) and toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) stimulate adaptor molecules (green) for the production of transcription
  factors (orange). Transcription factors relocate to the nucleus to trigger the production
  of interferons (IFN, light blue). Interferons transport outside the nucleus to initiate
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway responsible for the production of the ISGF3 complex,
  which relocates to the nucleus to stimulate the production of ISGs. ISGs have various
  antiviral effects targeting viral replication or directly acting on the interferon
  pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
