caption: PAUF activates the MyD88-dependent, not the TRIF-dependent, TLR4 downstream
  pathway. (A) Panc-1_Mock and Panc-1_TLR4OE cells were treated with rPAUF (0.1 μg/mL)
  for 0, 10, 30, and 60 min. Collected proteins were immunoprecipitated with MyD88
  antibody (α-MyD88) using protein A agarose beads. Immunocomplexes were determined
  by Western blot against MyD88 and TLR4. (B) Panc-1_Mock and Panc-1_TLR4OE cells
  were treated with rPAUF (0.1 μg/mL) for 0, 60, and 120 min. Collected proteins were
  immunoprecipitated with TRIF antibody (α-TRIF) using protein A agarose beads. Immunocomplexes
  were determined by Western blot against TRIF and TLR4. (C) Western blot showed that
  Panc-1_trans TLR4OE cells were successfully engineered to transiently overexpress
  TLR4, compared to the control, Panc-1_trans Ctrl cells. (D) Panc-1_trans Ctrl and
  Panc-1_trans TLR4OE cells were pretreated with or without IKK inhibitor XII (5 μM)
  for 4 h before rPAUF (0.1 μg/mL) or PBS treatment. After overnight culture, cells
  were collected for dual-luciferase activity assay. Data are represented as a mean
  ± SD from triplicates (**** p < 0.0001 were obtained from two-way ANOVA and post-hoc
  multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction). (E) Panc-1_Mock and Panc-1_TLR4OE
  cells were treated with rPAUF (0.1 μg/mL) for 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min, and
  activation of TRIF-dependent TLR4 downstream molecules (p-TBK1 and p-IRF3) was estimated
  using Western blot.
