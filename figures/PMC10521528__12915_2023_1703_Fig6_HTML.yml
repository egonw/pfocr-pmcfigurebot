caption: Sex-specific responses of different tissues under different temperatures
  of E. hecabe. A A Venn diagram showing the total number of differentially expressed
  protein-coding genes identified in both sexes under different temperatures. B Schematic
  diagram showing the canonical biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenoid hormones in
  insects (upper), and the heatmaps showing expression of sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic
  pathway genes in different tissues at different temperatures. C A Venn diagram showing
  the total number of differentially expressed microRNAs identified in both sexes
  under different temperatures. D Heatmap showing expression of members in the miR-2733
  cluster (F, female; M, male; B, body; H, head; 18, at 18 °C; 25, at 25 °C; 30, at
  30 °C)
