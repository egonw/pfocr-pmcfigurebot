caption: 'Aerobic exercise reduced the DNA damage response pathway in retroperitoneal
  WAT. (a) Western Blotting representation of proteins related to DNA damage response
  pathway (H2AX, p53, p21); (b) γH2AX phosphorylation; (c) H2AX/B-Actin expression;
  (d) p-P53 phosphorylation; (e) p-P21 phosphorylation; (f) Gene expression related
  to Cell cycle arrest. All western blot data were normalized to total protein or
  β-actin and expressed as relative to control. γH2AX: phosphorylated- H2A histone
  family member X; H2AX: H2A histone family member X; Cdkn2a: cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor 2A; Cdkn2d: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2D. The data were expressed
  as the mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6 animals/group). •—Control group;
  ▫—Exercise group. * Statistical difference between groups.'
