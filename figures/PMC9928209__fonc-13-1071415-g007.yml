caption: Tanshinone IIA Signal Pathway Interaction Process (induced by Tanshinone
  IIA are noted by using →, while the inhibition represented by ⊣ symbol). MAPK signal
  pathway is correlated with RAS and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Tanshinone IIA can inhibit the
  occurrence, development, migration and vascularization of hepatocytes by blocking
  related pathways by inhibiting common upstream and downstream molecules, growth
  factors and their receptors.
