caption: 'Targeted nanoparticle of Platin-L for clinically relevant formulation development.
  Scatter plot indicating the relative expression of PSMA in (A) non-ADT-treated patient
  samples and (B) ADT-treated patient samples between benign and cancerous regions
  with respect to the nuclei. Quantification was done on the images using ImageJ software
  for an area containing around 30 nuclei. Statistical analyses were carried out using
  a two-tailed paired t test with an α value of 0.05. (C) Synthesis of Platin-L-loaded
  nanoparticles made from PLGA-b-PEG3500-GLU and PLGA-b-PEG6000-Mal, followed by conjugation
  of the Fc immunoglobulin fragment producing dual-targeted T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NPs.
  (D) Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of dual-targeted NPs using DLS. (E)
  Analyses of morphology and diameter of dual-targeted NPs using TEM. (F) Percent
  Fc conjugation of Platin-L-loaded nanoparticles made with PLGA-b-PEG6000-Mal and
  dual-targeted nanoparticles. (G) PSMA-mediated uptake of the targeted nanoparticles
  in PSMA-positive LNCaP and PSMA-negative PC3 cells. (H) Fatty acid dependency and
  glucose dependency of cisplatin, Platin-L, and T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NP in LNCaP cells.
  [Platin-L]: 50 μM and [cisplatin]: 50 μM. The concentration of T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L
  was calculated with respect to [Pt]: 50 μM. Statistical analysis was carried out
  using an ordinary one-way ANOVA analysis with an α value of 0.05. (I) Fatty acid
  dependency and glucose dependency of cisplatin, Platin-L, and T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NP
  in PC3 cells. Statistical analysis was carried out using an ordinary one-way ANOVA
  analysis with an α value of 0.05.'
