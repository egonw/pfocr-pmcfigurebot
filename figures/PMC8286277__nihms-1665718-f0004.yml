figure_title: Correlation of RAF1/ ERK1/2 pathway with survival of platinum-treated
  HGSC patients
caption: A-C. Kaplan Meierâ€™s curves showing the association between RAF1/MAPK pathway
  and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively of platinum-treated
  patients with HGSC stages 2+3+4. Tables in B-D indicate the values used in the calculation
  of OS and PFS, respectively. Significance was deemed at *p<0.05. Graphs were generated
  from KM Plot (https://www.kmplot.com) [] with JetSet probe set selected.
