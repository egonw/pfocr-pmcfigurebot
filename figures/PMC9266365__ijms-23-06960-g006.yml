caption: 'Alteration of Parkin expression can regulate apoptosis in HFF cells after
  UVA irradiation. (a–c) Levels of mitophagy proteins Parkin, PINK1, measured by western
  blot in response to Parkin knockdown. (d–f) Levels of apoptosis-related proteins
  Bax/Bcl−2 and Bak/Mcl−1 measured by western blot in response to Parkin knockdown.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. #p < 0.05, ##p <0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. control
  cells, ** p < 0.01 vs. UVA-treated cells, +p < 0.05, ++p < 0.01, vs. metformin co-treated
  cells.'
