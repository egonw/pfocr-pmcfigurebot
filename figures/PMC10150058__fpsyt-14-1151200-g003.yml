caption: 'Top six metabolic pathways. (A) Histogram of top six metabolic pathways.
  (B) Bubble diagram of metabolic pathways. Each bubble represents a metabolic pathway.
  The top six pathways were highlighted in yellow color, and the rest remaining were
  in blue color. Based on the significant values of value of p, pathway impact score,
  and FDR (<0.05, >0.2, and < 0.05, respectively), the top six metabolic pathways
  were selected and shown by name. Ctrl: control group; AD: alcohol dependence group.'
