caption: Physiological functions of CARD9 signaling. DAMPs and PAMPs sensed by PRRs
  lead to CARD9 activation. Next, CARD9 recruits BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CBM complex
  for the activation of MAPK and NF‐κB. PRRs can also directly activate CARD9. Finally,
  the activation of MAPK and NF‐κB contributes to gene expression related to cell
  proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis, differentiation, and immune response. In this
  interaction network, the preferential binding of p‐p38 MAPK to p38IP isolated p38IP
  from ATG9, thereby indirectly impairing ATG9 transport and autophagosome formation.
  Besides, p‐p38 MAPK‐mediated ATG5 phosphorylation inhibits autophagosome‐lysosome
  fusion, leading to autophagy suppression.

  in IgA nephropathy via the CARD9/p38 MAPK pathway.
