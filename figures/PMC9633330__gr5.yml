caption: Sex differences in Treg cells in patients with juvenile-onset SLE(A) Cumulative
  cell frequency flow cytometry data of Treg cells (CD4+CD25+CD127–) comparing 17
  young post-pubertal healthy cisgender men, 12 cisgender men with juvenile-onset
  SLE, 22 young post-pubertal healthy cisgender women, and 23 cisgender women with
  juvenile-onset SLE; data were assessed by t test and are mean (SE). (B) Treg cell-mediated
  suppression of activated Tresp cells in five cisgender men and five cisgender women
  with juvenile-onset SLE, and four cisgender men and four cisgender women without
  juvenile-onset SLE; data were assessed with t test and are mean (SE). (C) Log2 fold
  changes and log10 p values of DEGs between five cisgender men and five cisgender
  women with juvenile-onset SLE, coloured points represent statistically significantly
  upregulated DEGs below p value threshold (p<0·01). Treg-cell gene expression by
  normalised counts of hormone (gender) (D) or sex chromosome specific genes (E) that
  were significantly associated with SLE by open target analysis (five per group);
  data were assessed with one-way ANOVA and are mean (SE); open bars are participants
  without juvenile-onset SLE and closed bars are participants with juvenile-onset
  SLE. (F) Overlap of DEGs (p<0·01) from Treg cells comparing patients with juvenile-onset
  SLE with healthy participants, stratified by sex (cisgender men and cisgender women).
  (G) Pathway analysis bar charts of enriched pathway ontology terms from sex-unique
  or overlapping DEGs. ANOVA=analysis of variance. SLE=systemic lupus erythematosus.
  DEGs=differentially expressed genes. Treg=regulatory T. Tresp=responder T. Unstim=unstimulated.
