caption: MAPK/ERK activation maintains FGFR function in CAFs in vitro. A) GSEA (Reactome
  pathway analysis) of FGFR score in breast cancer from GEO. B) The effect of FGFRi
  Erdafitinib on p-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 expression of human CAFs and mouse CAFs
  was detected by western blot. C) The effect of MAPK pathway inhibitor U0126 on cell
  proliferation of human CAFs and mouse CAFs for 48 h was detected by CCK-8 assay
  (n=3 biological replicates, one-way ANOVA). D) The effect of U0126 on cell migration
  of human CAFs and mouse CAFs was detected by transwell migration assay (n=3 biological
  replicates, one-way ANOVA). E) The effect of U0126 on VCAM-1 expression of human
  CAFs and mouse CAFs was detected by western blot. F) The effect of U0126 on VCAM-1
  level in cell supernatant of human CAFs and mouse CAFs was detected by ELISA (n=3
  biological replicates, one-way ANOVA).
