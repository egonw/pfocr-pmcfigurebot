caption: Quantitative and qualitative analytical Charts for metabolically engineered
  HEK293T cells using different multiple expression plasmids for astaxanthin biosynthesis.
  (A) Total ketocarotenoid concentration graph (including canthaxanthin or astaxanthin)
  from cell extracts transfected with different collections of plasmids. DW, dry weight.
  (B) Total ketocarotenoid concentration comparison with astaxanthin content and ratio.
  (C) Total ketocarotenoid concentration comparison with canthaxanthin content and
  ratio. Data were presented as means Â± SD (three biological replicates), and a one-way
  ANOVA analysis was used to determine the significant differences between different
  approaches. p-values were calculated and represented as p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and
  p < 0.001 and indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively. (D) Transfected HEK293T
  cell pellets with red color indicate the accumulation of ketocarotenoids compared
  with control samples.
