caption: Role of the cGAS-STING pathway in HFD-induced NAFLD []. HFD-induced NAFLD
  manifests as steatosis, which leads to mitochondrial stress injury and the release
  of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. Subsequently, the mtDNA is recognized
  by cGAS and produces cGAMP to activate the STING downstream pathways, including
  STING-TBK1-IRF3 and STING-NF-κB, which trigger the transcription of type-I IFNs
  and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the hepatic inflammatory
  response. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the function of macrophages/KCs
  and produce TGF-β, which activates HSCs and aggravates liver fibrosis in NASH.
