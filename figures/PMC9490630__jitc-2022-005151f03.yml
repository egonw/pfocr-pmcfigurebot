caption: STING is involved in murine-induced and human-induced Treg differentiation
  in vitro. Murine CD4+-naïve T cells were isolated from WT or TKO mice and plated
  in wells precoated with an anti-CD3 mAb (3 µg/mL) in mIL-2 (50 IU/L) medium (CM)
  as a control subgroup or in CM with more mIL-2 (200 IU/L) as the higher IL-2 subgroup
  for 3 days. (A) The representative FACS plot and statistical graph show the frequencies
  of Tregs (CD4+CD25high FOXP3+) induced from CD4+-naïve T cells isolated from WT
  and TKO mice under the indicated conditions. (B) Western blot analysis showed the
  protein expression levels of p-TBK1, TBK1, p-IRF3 and IRF3 in CD4+ T cells from
  WT and TKO mice after culture under CM and high IL-2 conditions. β-Actin was included
  as a control. (C) Human CD4+-naïve T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  were plated in wells precoated with an antihuman CD3 Ab (OKT3, 1 µg/mL) in hIL-2
  (50 IU/L) medium (CM), transfected with the STING-KD vector, STING-OE vector and
  the corresponding lenti-control vectors (NC) and then cultured for 3 days. The FACS
  plot and statistical graph show the frequencies of Tregs induced from CD4+-naïve
  T cells infected with the STING-KD, STING-OE and control vectors. (D) Western blot
  analysis showed the expression of STING signaling pathway proteins, including STING,
  p-TBK1 and p-IRF3 and FOXP3, in human CD4+ T cells under the same conditions described
  in (C). The results are representative of at least three independent experiments.
  All values are shown as the mean±SEM. **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001, Student’s t-test.
