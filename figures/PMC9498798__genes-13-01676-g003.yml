caption: Significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) plots based on gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA). (A–C) GO plots of the most significantly enriched gene sets in
  CrTK14 vs. CrTK15, CrTK15 vs. CrTK16 and CrTK14 vs. CrTK16 groups. (D,E) “Epithelial
  cell proliferation” and “regulation of epithelial cell proliferation” were significantly
  enriched in CrTK14 vs. CrTK15. (F) “Smoothened signaling pathway” was significantly
  enriched in CrTK15 vs. CrTK16. (G,H) The top 2 negative enrichment in CrTK14 vs.
  CrTK15. (I,J) The top 2 negative enrichment in CrTK15 vs. CrTK16.
