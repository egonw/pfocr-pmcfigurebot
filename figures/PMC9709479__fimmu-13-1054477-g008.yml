caption: 'Differentially Expressed Genes in Cluster #9 Led to Changes in Cellular
  Stress Response and Metabolism. Processed human BAL cells were enriched for phagocytic
  APCs and incubated with C neoformans strain H99 for 2h and processed for scRNA-seq.
  Genes differentially expressed in cluster #9 when compared to cluster #1 were analyzed
  by IPA. (A) Differential expression of select genes in clusters #9 and #1. Top 10
  significantly regulated canonical pathways (B) and predicted upstream regulators
  (C) as ordered by p-value or p-value of overlap. To the right of each bar is the
  statistical z-score for each pathway or upstream regulator with positive and negative
  being increased and decreased, respectively (NaN = not a number, no activity pattern).
  Data shown are combined cells from three individual experiments (n=3).'
