caption: Inhibition of the P2X7R on lung cancer cells abrogates MSC-CM-triggered tumor
  proliferation and migration.A–F, the levels of proteins and phosphoproteins of MSC-CM–treated
  lung cancer cells in the presence or absence of P2X7R inhibitor (A 438079). Relative
  expression levels of phosphoproteins were normalized according to the levels of
  total proteins and the loading control (GAPDH) and are shown as dot plots. G and
  H, the number of LM cells (G) and A549 cells (H) after treatment with or without
  MSC-CM in the presence or absence of A 438079 was counted at the indicated time
  points. I and J, cell migration was assessed in LM cells (I) and A549 cells (J)
  after treatment with or without MSC-CM in the presence or absence of A 438079. Representative
  images from three independent experiments are displayed, and the number of migrating
  cells is shown as mean ± standard deviation in histogram plots. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, two-tailed t test. CM, conditioned medium; LM, low-motility;
  MSC, mesenchymal stem cell.
