figure_title: ctl-2(ua90)II strain reacts differently to HS compared with WT outside
  of heat shock response as well
caption: (A) ER UPR was activated in both WT and ctl-2(ua90)II strains. (B) mtUPR
  was modestly up-regulated in WT, as evidenced by increase in expression of CLPP-1
  caspase but was absent in ctl-2(ua90)II strain. (C) HS does not affect transcript
  levels of SOD enzymes in the ctl-2(ua90)II strain. (D) HS increases transcript levels
  of G6PD, rate-limiting enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway in WT but not in ctl-2(ua90)II
  strain. Gene expression normalized to act-1. Error bars are mean Â± SD for biological
  replicates. (E) ROS levels are comparable between WT and ctl-2(ua90)II mutant but
  are increased in ctl-2(ua90)II during HS. ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01;
  *P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA plus Tukey test).
