caption: 'Effect of cadmium and/or linagliptin administration on the testicular pro-inflammatory
  response and HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway in rats. The co-treatment with linagliptin
  lowered testicular TNF-α (A) and augmented IL-10 (B) alongside curtailing the testicular
  HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway that was stimulated by cadmium metal. The later event was
  demonstrated by downregulated protein expression of the high mobility group box
  protein 1 (HMGB1; (C)), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4; (D)), and nuclear expression
  of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κBp65; (E)). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and ***
  p < 0.001 show statistical significance compared to the group of control rats; #
  p < 0.05, and ## p < 0.01 show statistical significance compared to the group of
  cadmium-intoxicated rats. Values are stated as the mean ± standard error of the
  mean for 6 animals per group. LIN, linagliptin; Cd, cadmium chloride.'
