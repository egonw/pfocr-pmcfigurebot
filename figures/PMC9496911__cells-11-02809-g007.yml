caption: Melatonin suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome in PC12 cells treated with H2O2
  by activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway. (A–I) Western blot detection and statistical
  analysis of NLRP3-inflammasome-related proteins NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and IL-1β;
  and antioxidant-stress-related proteins nuclear Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 in PC12 cells
  from each group (n = 6). (J,K) The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant
  of PC12 cells were determined by ELISA kits (n = 6). Data are shown as the means
  ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
