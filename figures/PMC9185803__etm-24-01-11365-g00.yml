caption: Effect of anti-CYR-61 on apoptosis in NSCLC cells. (A) Fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting was used to evaluate the apoptosis of H358 cells after anti-CYR-61
  treatment. Apoptosis-related (B) mRNA and (C) protein expression levels in an exogenous
  cell apoptosis signaling pathway were analyzed in anti-CYR-61-treated cells. Apoptosis-related
  (D) mRNA and (E) protein expression levels in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
  were analyzed in anti-CYR-61-treated cells. Data are presented as the mean Â± standard
  deviation of triplicate samples. **P<0.01 vs. the control. CYR-61, cysteine-rich
  angiogenic inducer-61; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer; FasL, Fas ligand; FADD,
  Fas-associated protein with Death Domain; Bak, B cell lymphoma-2 antagonist/killer;
  Bax, B cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating
  factor 1.

  suppresses growth and migration of non-small cell lung cancer.
