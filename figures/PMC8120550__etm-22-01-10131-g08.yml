caption: Potential pathway regulated by ING3. (A) GeneMANIA analysis revealed interaction
  between ING3 and a core protein of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that ING3 may regulate the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (B) Wnt signaling pathway. (C) Wnt signaling pathway involved in breast
