caption: The knockdown of CEBPB inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in
  MRL/lpr mice. Relative expression of key proteins in the inflammasome-related signaling
  pathway in MRL/lpr mice after CEBPB downregulation (a); representative images of
  immunofluorescence detection of NLRP3 (b) and CEBPB (c) expression (50 μm) in MRL/lpr
  mice with knockdown of CEBPB. (CEBPB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β).
