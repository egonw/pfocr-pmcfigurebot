caption: 'Effect of JuA on PPAR-α signaling pathway in CHD rats. (a) WB was used to
  detect the protein expression levels of PPAR-α, p65, p-p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα in
  cardiomyocytes of rats in each group; (b) Image J was used to analyze the protein
  expression levels of PPAR-α and the ratios of p-p65/p65 and p-IκBα/IκBα. ###P <
  0.001 vs. control group; ∗P < 0.01, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗P < 0.001 vs. CHD group.'
