caption: SHMT2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and associated with a poor prognosis.
  A. The expression of SHMT2 protein in various Breast cancer cell lines (MCF-1, MDA-MB-231,
  HCC1806, ZR-75-1, BT549) and a normal breast cell line (MCF-10A) was analyzed by
  Western blotting. B. The expression of SHMT2 protein was tested by Western blotting
  in 8 breast cancer tissue and matched para-cancer tissue. C. Representative pictures
  of SHMT2 by immunohistochemistry were shown in breast cancer tissues and matched
  para-carcinoma tissues. Original magnification, 200 ×. D. Kaplan-Meier method was
  used to compute survival analysis comparing patients with high (n = 64) and low
  (n = 76) expression. E. With CPTAC data, the expression of SHMT2 in breast cancer
  tissues compared with normal breast tissues. F. Survival analysis was further conducted.
  ***P < 0.001, Student’s t-test. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three
  tests. T, breast cancer tissue; N, matched para-carcinoma tissue.
