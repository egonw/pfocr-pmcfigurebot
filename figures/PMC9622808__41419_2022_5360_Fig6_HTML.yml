caption: 27HC is the most effective oxysterol in the circulatory system and hematological
  malignancies. 27HC increases the ROS response and induces apoptosis through the
  ER stress response pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of CYP7B1 (expected to have
  an elevation of 27HC) would potentially have fewer long-term hematological side
  effects, particularly when used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation for
  the treatment of leukemia patients.
