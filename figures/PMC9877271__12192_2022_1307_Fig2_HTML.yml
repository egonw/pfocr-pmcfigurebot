caption: Effect of freezing, anoxia, and dehydration stresses on the relative expression
  levels of ATF4 pathway proteins (ATF4, ATF3, GADD34, and GADD153) in liver (a) and
  skeletal muscle (b) of wood frogs. Mean values for controls (at 5 °C) were set to
  1.0 and experimental data are expressed relative to controls for freeze/thaw exposure
  (− 2.5 °C for 24 h, then 8-h thaw at 5 °C), anoxia/recovery (24-h anoxia, then 4-h
  aerobic recovery at 5 °C), and dehydration (40% dehydration, then full rehydration
  at 5 °C). Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4 independent biological replicates. Statistical
  testing used one-way ANOVA and Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test with p < 0.05
  accepted as significant. *Significantly different from controls
