caption: Performance of selected strains on chemostat fermentation. a CO2 evolution
  rate (CER) in mmol·L− 1·h− 1 during whole fermentation. b Growth curves of selected
  strains OE-cyp (overexpressing cyp), OE-fadE (overexpressing fadE), OE-fadA (overexpressing
  fadA) and B36. c By-product oxalic acid of all strains. d Relative fold change of
  genes fadE, fadA and cyp at mid-exponential growth phase and steady state. The expression
  levels of 3 genes in overexpression strains were normalized by their values, set
  to 1, in B36. e Intracellular free fatty acids, extracellular glucoamylase and total
  secreted protein of all strains at steady state. Error bars represent the standard
  errors of the means of three biological replicates

  synthesis in Aspergillus niger.
