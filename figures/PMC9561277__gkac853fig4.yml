caption: APE1 assembles biomolecular condensates in vitro to promote ATR DDR pathway.
  (A) WT but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP formed phase separation in PANC1 nuclear extracts.
  Recombinant YFP, WT or △N33 His-APE1-YFP protein (0.55 mM) was added to PANC1 nuclear
  extract and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by fluorescence microscopy
  analysis. (B) DNase I and RNase A had almost no effect on the APE1-assembled phase
  separation in nuclear extracts. DNase I and RNase A (2 mg/ml each) was added to
  PANC1 nuclear extracts and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Then WT His-APE1-YFP protein
  (0.55 mM) was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by fluorescence
  microscopy analysis. (C) APE1 inhibitors had no noticeable effect on phase separation
  formed by APE1 in nuclear extracts. WT His-APE1-YFP protein (0.55 mM) was added
  to PANC1 supplemented with DMSO or APE1 inhibitors (AR03, APE1i III, and E3330).
  After 15-min incubation at room temperature, reaction mixtures were examined via
  fluorescence microscopy analysis. (D) APE1 inhibitors had no effect on the Chk1
  phosphorylation induced by the excess addition of APE1 protein in PANC1 nuclear
  extracts. APE1 inhibitor (AR03, APE1i III or E3330) was added to PANC1 nuclear extracts
  and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, which was supplemented with WT His-APE1-YFP
  (0.55 mM) and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. The samples were
  then analyzed via immunoblotting analysis as indicated. (E) WT but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP
  associated with ATR, TopBP1 and ETAA1 in PANC1 nuclear extracts. ‘Input’ and ‘Pulldown’
  samples from pulldown experiments were examined via immunoblotting analysis as indicated.
  AR03 or E3330 was added to 1 mM. (F) WT but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP formed phase separation
  in a LLPS buffer. WT but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP (0.55 mM) was added to a LLPS buffer
  and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by fluorescence microscopy
  analysis. (G) Phase separation formed by recombinant WT His-APE1-YFP protein was
  fused into large biomolecular condensates in a LLPS buffer. WT His-APE1-YFP (0.55
  mM) was added to a buffer and incubated for 2 h before fluorescence microscopy analysis.
  BF, bright field. (H) Phase separation assembled by APE1 in a LLPS buffer was not
  affected by the APE1 inhibitors. WT His-APE1-YFP protein (0.55 mM) was added to
  LLPS buffer supplemented with DMSO or APE1 inhibitors (AR03, APE1i III and E3330).
  After 15-min incubation at room temperature, reaction mixtures were examined via
  fluorescence microscopy analysis. (I–M) The requirement of NT33 motif within APE1
  for phase separation in a LLPS buffer was bypassed with the presence of different
  DNA or RNA. WT but not △N33 His-APE1-YFP (0.55 mM) was added to a buffer supplemented
  with 0.5 μM of different DNA/RNA structures (dsDNA (I), dsDNA with AP site (J),
  ssDNA (K), ssDNA with AP site (L) and ssRNA (M)). Reaction mixtures were incubated
  for 15 min at room temperature before fluorescence microscopy analysis. All scale
  bars = 50 μm.
