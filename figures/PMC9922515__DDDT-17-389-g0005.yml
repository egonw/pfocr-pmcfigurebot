caption: The effect of solanine on the AAMDC pathway of autophagy in vivo. (A) The
  protein levels of cleaved Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, LC3, AAMDC, MYC, ATF4 and Sesn2
  were measured by the Western blot analysis. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of ATF4
  in SGC-7901 cells. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3).
