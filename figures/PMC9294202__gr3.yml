caption: 'Mechanistic regulation of ASK1 in NASH: In oxidative stress, ASK1 activity
  is regulated by several positive (TRAF2/6, USP9X, TRIM48, and TNFAIP3) or negative
  regulators (TRX, 14-3-3, CFLAR CREG, Roquin-2, and DKK3) either by PTMs such as
  phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and methylation
  or by inducing conformational changes. The TRX binds to the N-terminal of ASK1 and
  keeps it inactive. However, TRX dissociation from ASK1 by ROS in oxidative stress
  conditions shifts the ASK1 towards an active state by reciprocally recruiting the
  TRAF2 and TRAF6. 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated serine (S966) of ASK1 and inactivates
  the ASK1. Though, oxidative stress of ROS dephosphorylates the site that leads to
  the dissociation of 14-3-3 from ASK1, which in turn switches the ASK1 in an active
  state. CFLAR negatively regulates ASK1 by blocking the N-terminus-mediated dimerization
  of ASK1. Moreover, in oxidative stress conditions, ITCH mediated the CFLAR degradation
  by ubiquitinating it and activating the ASK1. CREG, DKK3, and PRMT1 are another
  negative regulator of ASK1 that shifts the ASK1 towards an inactive state. Even
  so, TRIM48 activates the ASK1 signalosome by promoting d degradation of PRMT1. Roquin-2
  mediates the ASK1 proteasomal degradation by C-terminal ubiquitination of ASK1;
  however, this process is reversed by the USP9X or TNFAIP3. Activated ASK1 regulates
  downstream signaling using two main pathways. First, the ASK1-MKK4/MKK7-JNK1 pathway,
  and second, the ASK1-MKK3/MKK6-P38 pathway.'
