figure_title: NcRNA-based therapeutics and delivery systems
caption: Several ncRNA-based therapeutics exist, including antisense oligonucleotides,
  siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNA mimics, anti-miRNAs, miRNA sponges, and therapeutic circRNAs
  (box 1). Their major limitations and side effects can expectedly be overcome by
  usage of unique delivery systems that include lipid and polymer nanoparticles, antibodies,
  bacteriophages, exosomes and viral vectors (box 2). Newer generation of ncRNA therapeutics
  with convenient clinical administration (box 3) are awaited candidates due to their
  numerous advantages, including utilization of existing cellular processing mechanisms,
  capability of multiple signaling pathway targeting and promising cost-effective
  production (box 4). siRNA, small interfering RNA; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; antimiRs,
  anti-microRNAs; circRNAs, circular RNAs. Created with BioRender.
