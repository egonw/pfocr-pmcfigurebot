caption: PDLIM1 knockdown bolsters GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
  and suppresses apoptosis. A cell model of PDLIM1 knockdown was established in MKN-45
  and AGS cells. (a) RT-PCR determined PDLIM1 expression. (b, c) CCK8 and BrdU examined
  the viability of MKN-45 and AGS cells. (d) Transwell monitored cell invasion and
  migration. (e) Flow cytometry measured cell apoptosis. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  (vs. the sh-NC group). N = 3.
