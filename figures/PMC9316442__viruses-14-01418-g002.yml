caption: ZIKV and DENV infection-induced distinct transcription programs. (A,B), RNA-seq
  identified significantly up-regulated RNA at statistical cut off of q < 0.001 (red)
  and q < 0.05 (black) in ZIKV (A) and DENV (B) infected hNPCs. (C,D), GSEA for KEGG
  pathway enrichment in the subset of mRNA up-regulated upon ZIKV (C) and DENV (D)
  infection. Pathways enriched in both ZIKV and DENV infected hNPCs are indicated
  in bold. (E), RNA fold change of ZIKV and DENV induced aminoacyl tRNA synthetases
  (ARS) genes. (F), Gene expression analysis by qRT PCR for SHMT2, PIM1, and ATF3
  in uninfected, ZIKV, and DENV infected hNPCs (biological replicates n = 3; experimental
  replicates n = 5â€“7; p < 0.05). Gene expression is normalized to beta-actin and fold
  change is plotted compared to uninfected samples. (G), ZIKV induced PIM1 expression
  that activates mTOR and mRNA translation. (H), ZIKV-induced transcription of genes
  involved in neurotrophin signaling, ZIKV targets are indicated in red. (I), DENV
  infection upregulates key enzymes involved in the one-carbon pool by the folate
  pathway, DENV targets are indicated in red. (J,K), GSEA transcription factor motif
  analysis identify common and distinct transcription factors involved in up-regulation
  of specific RNAs in ZIKV (n = 341; q < 0.05) (J) and DENV (n = 111; q < 0.05) (K)
  infected hNPCs.
