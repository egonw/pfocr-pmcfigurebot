caption: Joint-Pathway Analysis using MetaboAnalyst. (A) Overview of the matched pathways
  according to the p-values resulted from joint-pathway analysis of the upregulated
  DEGs and quantified metabolites. Dots illustrate all the pathways that were found
  enriched represented by upregulated DEGs and/or quantified metabolites. (B) The
  statistically significant enriched pathways (p < 0.05) represented by both upregulated
  DEGs and metabolites. Numbers indicated the respective dots in (A). Upregulated
  DEGs and quantified metabolites matching with each pathway are presented. (C) Genes
  associated with the “Arginine and proline M” and found statistically significant
  different between breast cancer tumors and normal samples in GEPIA database. M;
  metabolism/metabolites, G; genes. * p < 0.05.
