caption: 'Analysis of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by Western blotting (A). The cells
  were treated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM of isorhamnetin. (B) The relative PI3K-AKT
  level was expressed as the ratio PI3K-AKT/GAPDH. The data are presented with the
  mean ± SEM and three replicates (****p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle-treated control; ##p
  < 0. 01 and ###p < 0. 001vs. PDGF-BB alone)'
