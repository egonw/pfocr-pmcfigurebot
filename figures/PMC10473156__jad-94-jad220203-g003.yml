caption: Mechanistic insights into how neuronal senescence is achieved from DNA damage
  responses. A) The competition and preferences of DSB repair pathways under healthy
  and diseased conditions. In healthy brains, c-NHEJ is the predominant pathway of
  DSB repair. Other pathways are suppressed by the c-NHEJ core machinery proteins.
  B) HR-mediated DSB repair in post-mitotic neurons results in long ssDNA resection
  and the failure in subsequent engagement into homologous sequence invasion caused
  by cell cycle constraints. This results in the persistence of single-stranded repair
  intermediates and chronic activation of ATR, where the latter is a strong driver
  of cell cycle checkpoint and senescence.
