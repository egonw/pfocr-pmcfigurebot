caption: Quantification of total charge transferred for yeast p58C and multi-mutants.
  Total charge transferred (nC) after electrochemical bulk oxidation conditions (8.33
  min) for wild-type, 5YF412, 5YF431, and 6YF were 51.0 ± 17.8 nC, 8.5 ± 5.3 nC, 7.1
  ± 4.4 nC, 4.0 ± 1.4 nC, respectively. All scans were performed on 38 μM 4Fe-4S p58C
  variants in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl and 75 mM NaCl at pH 7.2, with a
  100-mV/s scan rate for CV. Error bars indicate the standard deviation for each protein
  (N = 3).
