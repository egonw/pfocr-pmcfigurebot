caption: ISP-I inhibited tumor proliferation and promoted tumor apoptosis in vivo
  by generation of ROS resulting in PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. (A) HE staining of
  tumor tissues and immunohistochemistry of Ki67, cleaved Caspase3 in vehicle-treated
  group and ISP-I-treated groups (30mg/kg, 60mg/kg). (B) Fluorescent microscopic observation
  of tumor tissues stained with DHE, which reflected ROS levels. (C) The protein expression
  of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT and p-AKT in vehicle-treated group and ISP-I-treated groups
  (30mg/kg, 60mg/kg) by western blotting.
