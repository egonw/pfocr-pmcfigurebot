caption: 'Signaling pathways that LINC00313 might regulate. (A) The correlation between
  LINC00313 and the activity of each signaling pathway based on the TCGA-HNSC dataset.
  (B) Signaling pathways differentially upregulated in the LINC00313 high- and low-expression
  groups based on KEGG analysis. (C) Correlation of LINC00313 expression with the
  expression of CDH1, SNAIL, and FN1. (D) The expressions of CDH1, SNAIL and FN1 on
  the control and LINC00313-silenced group in SCC9 cells were assessed using qRT-PCR.
  (E) Western blot results on LINC00313-silenced group and control group in SCC9 cells.
  (F) Correlation analysis of LINC00313 expression with VIM, TWIST1, TJP1, and MMP2.
  (G) Signaling pathways differentially down-regulated in the LINC00313 high- and
  low- expression groups based on KEGG analysis. (H) Signaling pathways differentially
  regulated in the tumors and normal tissues based on KEGG analysis. *: P-value <
  0.05.'
