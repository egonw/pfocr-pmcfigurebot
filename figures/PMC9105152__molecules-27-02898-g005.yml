caption: 'Effect of coconut oil on mitogen−activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  in artificial particulate matter (APM) and diesel exhaust particles (DEP)−stimulated
  alveolar macrophages (MH−S). (A–C) Phosphorylation of extracellular receptor-activated
  kinase (ERK), C−Jun N−terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK was detected via Western
  blotting. (D–F) Relative densities of p−JNK, p−p38 MAPK, and p−ERK proteins. Vehicle
  control (VC) was treated with cell medium including 10% distilled water. Data are
  presented as the means ± SD (n = 3 per group). The normalized value of target protein
  expression level in the control group was set to 1. *** p < 0.001 vs. VC; ### p
  < 0.001 vs. APM; §§§ p < 0.001 vs. DEP groups.'
