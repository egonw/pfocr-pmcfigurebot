caption: 'Mutating the CERT-binding interface of pUL21 inhibits CERT dephosphorylation
  and reduces the rate of sphingomyelin synthesis in infected cells.A, HaCaT cells
  were infected at MOI = 5 with WT HSV-1, HSV-1 lacking pUL21 expression (ΔpUL21),
  or a pUL21 point mutant virus (pUL21V382E). Lysates were harvested at 16 hpi in
  the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to SDS-PAGE plus immunoblotting
  using the antibodies listed. Where indicated, the gel was supplemented with PhosTag
  reagent to enhance separation of CERT phosphoforms. The antibody recognizing phosphorylated
  Akt substrates (Akt sub) illustrates activity of the HSV-1 kinase pUS3, several
  substrates of which are dephosphorylated in a pUL21-dependent manner (arrowheads)
  (). VP5, infection control. B, quantitation of the CERT dephosphorylation level
  (ratio of CERTO to total CERT) in cells infected with WT or mutant HSV-1, as determined
  by densitometry. Results are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for the statistical
  analysis (ns, nonsignificant; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001). C, Vero cells were infected
  at MOI = 1, fixed at 14 hpi, and stained with DAPI (blue) plus an antibody recognizing
  pUL21 (green). D, pulse-chase experiment to measure the rate of Sph conversion to
  Cer, SM, and PC. HaCaT cells were infected with WT or pUL21V382E HSV-1 at MOI =
  5 or mock infected. Cells were incubated with 5 μM alkyne-Sph (pulse) at 14 hpi
  for 5 min and harvested for lipid extraction either immediately (0 min) or at the
  indicated times (chase). Extracted lipids were bioconjugated to 3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin
  using click chemistry, separated by HPTLC, visualized using UV light, and relative
  lipid abundances were quantitated by densitometry. Data are from one representative
  experiment of two independent repeats. E, rate of SM synthesis expressed as its
  fraction in the cumulative signal for SM and Cer. F, the proportion of alkyne-Sph
  incorporated into either Cer or SM, representing the temporal influx of Sph into
  the SM biosynthesis pathway. E and F, the data represent two independent experiments
  (mean ± SD). Data points are labeled if significantly different to WT HSV-1: ∗∗p <
  0.01; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). G,
  the resolubilized proteins precipitated during lipid extraction were analyzed by
  SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the antibodies listed. Cer, ceramide; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
  hpi, hours postinfection; HPTLC, high-performance TLC; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus
  1; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PC, phosphatidylcholine; SM, sphingomyelin; Sph,
  sphingosine.'
