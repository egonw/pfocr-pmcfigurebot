caption: 'Therapeutic and antioxidative effects of DEX in asthma are partly diminished
  by ML385. (A) The protein expression levels of Nrf2 (cytoplasmic and nuclear), Keap1,
  HO-1 and GPx4 were assessed using western blotting. (B) MDA content (C) activity
  levels of SOD and (D) GSH content in lung tissues were assessed using commercial
  kits. (E) H&E and PAS staining were performed to evaluate inflammatory cell infiltration
  and mucus production in lung tissues, respectively. Magnification for H&E staining,
  ×200; magnification for PAS staining, ×100; scale bar, 100 µm. Color imbalance was
  corrected as described by Marty (). (F) Histological scoring of inflammatory cell
  infiltration and mucus production were based on the layers of the cells around the
  airways and the percentage of PAS-positive cells, respectively. (G) The concentration
  of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed using commercial
  ELISA kits. Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). Ordinal data
  are presented as the median + interquartile range (n=7). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and
  ****P<0.0001; #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01; ^P<0.05 and ^^P<0.01. DEX, dexmedetomidine;
  GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GSH, reduced glutathione; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin;
  HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; Keap1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; ns, not significant OVA, ovalbumin;
  PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
