caption: 'Metabolites and enzymes related to PE de novo synthesis pathway changed
  significantly in the liver of T2DM mice. A and B, Heat maps of PE (A) and DG (B)
  in the liver tissues. C: Two major pathways of PE synthesis in mammalian cells,
  the PISD pathway and de novo pathway. D: qRT-PCR was used to detect mRNA levels
  of Pcyt2 and Pisd in mice liver (n = 6). E: The protein levels of Pcyt2 and Pisd
  in mice liver were detected by Western blotting (n = 3). All experiments were repeated
  three times. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. DG, diglyceride; Pcyt2, phosphoethanolamine
  cytidylytransferase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Pisd, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus.'
