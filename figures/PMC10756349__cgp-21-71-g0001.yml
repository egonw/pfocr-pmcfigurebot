figure_title: 'CellChat analysis reveals CD39 related MF- ACKR1 ECs interactions enriched
  in PD. (A) Heatmap showing the cell-cell communication strength between ECs clusters
  and other cell types. (B) Heatmap of differential MF- ECs cell interaction between
  PR and PD. The elevated interaction (red block) and down-regulation (blue block)
  interaction in PD is shown. (C) Histogram showing the up-regulated MF-ACKR1 ECs
  interaction pathway in PD. The score of informative flow was calculated by summing
  all the interaction probability in PD and PR. The pathway significantly enriched
  in PD is indicated with red letters, while the pathway significantly enriched in
  PR is indicated with blue letters, p<0.01. (D) Violin plot illustrating the expression
  of ENTPD1 of ECs at different treatment time points. (E) Violin plot indicating
  the expression of TMIGD3 of macrophage in different treatment time points. ECs:
  Endothelial cells; PR: partial response; PD: progressive disease'
