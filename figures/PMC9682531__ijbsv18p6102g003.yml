caption: 'The selected dose of LY attenuates GC-induced senescence and collagen synthesis
  decrease in HDFs. Cells were pretreated with LY at doses as indicated for 6 h, then
  treated with 0.1 µM CP for 24 h. (A) Cell viability was detected using the MTT assay.
  (B) The expressions of p-GR, GR, and FKBP51 were evaluated by western blot analysis.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. (C) Cell senescence was identified by β-galactosidase
  staining. (D) Components of collagen synthesis, and MAPK signaling pathway in HDFs
  were identified by western blot. Values shown are means ± SE. Quantification of
  the results is shown (n = 3), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus control,
  #p< 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 versus CP. β-actin was used as a loading control.'
