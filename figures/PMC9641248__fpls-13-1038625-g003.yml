caption: Metabolic pathway for flavonoid biosynthesis and putative transcriptional
  regulatory network. The heatmap presents the expression of corresponding genes (or
  the relative contents of metabolites) in the three colored qingke varieties. The
  color scale from blue to red in the heatmap indicates the FPKM of genes (or the
  relative contents of metabolites) ranging from low to high. Red arrows indicate
  the main metabolic flux of colored grains during developmental color-changing and
  maturation stages. Green arrows represent the direction of the diminished metabolic
  flux for all varieties during developmental color-changing and maturation stages.
  The full gene/enzyme names and expression level comparisons are shown in . White
  (W), blue (B), and purple (P) qingke grains in the grain developmental stage (I),
  grain color-changing stage (II), and grain maturation stage (III), respectively.

  of Tibetan hulless barley grain coloration.
