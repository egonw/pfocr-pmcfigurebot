caption: ZD6474 downregulated AKT-mTOR signal pathway in TGF‑β1-stimulated HTFs and
  HUVECs. a The expression levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR in TGF‑β1- stimulated HTFs were
  detected by western blot analysis and normalized to total AKT, mTOR and GAPDH, respectively.
  b The expression levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR in HUVECs were detected by western blot
  analysis and normalized to total AKT, mTOR and GAPDH. HTFs, human Tenon fibroblasts,
  HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells
article_title: ZD6474 attenuates TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in human Tenon fibroblasts
  and inhibits neovascularization via AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
