caption: 'Effect of DI on the expression levels of AMPK signaling pathway related-factors
  in broiler chickens under heat stress. (A) Relative AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) α1 mRNA expression level; (B) Immunoblot of p-AMPKα, AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  α (ACCα), and p-ACCα; (C) Quantitative analysis of p-AMPKα/AMPKα; (D) Quantitative
  analysis of p-ACCα/ACCα. Data are expressed as means ± SE (n = 3 to 8). ##P < 0.01,
  compared to the control group; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, compared to the HS group.'
