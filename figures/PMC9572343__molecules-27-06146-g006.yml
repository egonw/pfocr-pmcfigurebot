caption: MKP~2 Promotes Dox Resistance Through EMT. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
  with MKP-2 siRNA for 72 h, then treated with the indicated Dox concentrations for
  another 24 h. (A) The wounded area was photographed (10×) and % of wound closure
  was evaluated and the result expressed as a percentage based on the ratio of the
  treated cells to the controls. (B) A cell invasion assay was performed, and the
  invaded cells were photographed. Cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE,
  and then assessed for (C) MMP-2 and MMP-9 (D) N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and β-Actin.
  Each value represents the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05,
  ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, compared with the correspondent control.
