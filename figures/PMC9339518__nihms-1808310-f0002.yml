figure_title: Impacts of cardiometabolic diseases and pharmacologic interventions
  on NAD+ homeostasis
caption: Cardiometabolic diseases are associated with NAD+ depletion. These stresses
  differentially impact NAD+ salvage pathway, which is the dominant synthesis pathway
  in the hearts. Failing hearts and diabetes promote NAD+ redox imbalance (low NAD+/NADH
  ratio), while failing hearts are also associated with lowered NAMPT expression.
  Failing hearts have up-regulated Nmrk2 expression, whose role in the pathogenesis
  is obscure. Pharmacologic agents to enhance NAD+synthesis or to inhibit consumption
  increase cellular NAD+ levels. Boosting NAD+ levels via precursors such as NR and
  NMN, or NAMPT activation improves cardiac outcomes. Alternatively, inhibitions of
  PARPs (by INO1001, ABT-888) and CD38 (by 78c) demonstrate therapeutic effects.
