caption: 'Expression of FAM83D in glioma cells and tissues. A, TCGA database demonstrated
  that FAM83 was highly expressed in GBM patients; * P < 0.05 vs. normal tissues;
  B, Western blotting was conducted to determine the protein expression of FAM83D
  in glioma and adjacent tissues; * P < 0.05 vs. tumor-adjacent normal tissues; #
  P < 0.05 vs. glioma patients in grade I or II; C, Western blotting was conducted
  to determine the protein expression of FAM83D in glioma cell lines (U87, U251, T98G,
  SHG44 and U118) and normal human astrocytes (NHAs); * P < 0.05 vs. NHA cells.'
