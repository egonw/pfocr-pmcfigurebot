caption: BRD4 regulates FoxM1/Plk1 pathway during the fibrosis of TED. (A) RT-qPCR
  quantification of BRD4, FoxM1, and Plk1 mRNA knockdown efficiency by BRD4-specific
  siRNA was performed on OFs from patients with TED (n = 4). (B) Western blot (normalized
  to β-Tublin) of BRD4, FoxM1, and Plk1 protein knockdown efficiency by BRD4-specific
  siRNA was done on OFs from patients with TED (n = 4). (C) RT-qPCR quantification
  of BRD4-specific siRNA reduction of TGF-β1-induced increases in the mRNA expressions
  of FoxM1, Plk1, α-SMA, COL1 A1, and COL1 A2 was performed on OFs from patients with
  TED (n = 4). (D) Western blot (normalized β-Tublin) was done of BRD4-specific siRNA
  reduction of TGF-β1-induced increases in the protein expressions of FoxM1, Plk1,
  α-SMA, and COL1 in OFs from patients with TED (n = 4). Data are expressed as means
  ± SD; P values are displayed and P < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant
  difference.
