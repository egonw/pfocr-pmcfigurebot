caption: Metabolic pathway prediction analysis showed significant differences between
  genotype and animal model. Prediction of metabolic pathways based on the microbial
  ecosystem was analyzed, and pathways significantly different overall (A) or in individual
  animal models (mouse [B], rat [C], pig [D]) showed no overlap, but similar functional
  correlations were related to vitamin synthesis and utilization.
