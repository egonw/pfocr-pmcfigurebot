figure_title: ASAP1 promotes chemotherapy resistance in GC
caption: A Drug sensitivity prediction demonstrated that pateints with high expression
  of ASAP1 tended to be more sensitive to oxaliplatin (p = 0.007), whereas there was
  no statistical difference in the sensitivity to fluorouracil between patients with
  high and low expression of ASAP1. B The effect of ASAP1 on the viability of SGC-7901
  cells in response to oxaliplatin or 5-FU. The WT and ASAP1+/− SGC-7901 cells were
  treated with increasing concentrations of oxaliplatin or 5-FU for 48 h. Cell viability
  was measured by CCK-8. IC50 values in two different drug treatments are shown (n = 3).
  C Flow cytometry analysis showing the comparison of apoptosis induction between
  WT and ASAP1+/− SGC-7901 cells in response to oxaliplatin. Bar chart showing the
  percentage of apoptotic cells with mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM),
  n = 3 biologically independent samples. The data are representative of three experiments
  with similar results. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired
  t-test. D, E Subcutaneous tumor model was established and injected different concentrations
  of Oxa intraperitoneally to nude mice, after 30 days, the nude mice were sacrificed
  to measure tumor size. F–H Comparison the activity of gastric cancer tissue 3D culture
  treated with oxaliplatin. KI67 staining intensity was used to analyze the correlation
  between ASAP1 expression and tissue viability after oxaliplatin treatment. Caspase3
  staining intensity was used to analyze the correlation between ASAP1 expression
  and apoptosis after oxaliplatin treatment.
