caption: The antitumor effects are mediated by knocking down of si-PDGFR-β via downregulating
  PI3K/AKT/EZH2 signaling pathway. (a) The Cignal Finder RTK Signaling 10-Pathway
  Reporter Array demonstrated that the up-expression of PDGFRβ activated, and the
  knockdown of PDGFRβ downregulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (b) Immunoblot
  analysis displayed that down-expression of PDGFRβ decreased the p-PI3K, p-AKT, EZH2,
  and PDL1 protein levels (∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. si-NC group).
