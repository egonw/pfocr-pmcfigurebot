caption: A BALB/c nude mice were anesthetized and sacrificed at the experimental endpoint,
  and subcutaneous xenograft tumors formed by PC3 cells were dissected and photographed
  (n = 8 for each group). B The subcutaneous tumor volumes were measured once a week
  and the growth curves were shown. C Each subcutaneous tumor at the experimental
  endpoint was weighed. D Orthotopic tumor growth of PC3 cells was monitored weekly
  by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Two representative images are shown for each
  time point. (n = 7 for each group) E Orthotopic tumor bioluminescence signals were
  measured by mean photon radiance. F–I Representative images F, G, hematoxylin and
  eosin staining (I), and quantification (H) of lung metastatic colonization of NOD/SCID
  mice treated with a tail-vein injection of RM-1 cells (n = 7 for each group). J,
  K Representative images of IHC staining and quantitative analyses showing the intratumoral
  expression of LIF and p-STAT3 within orthotopic xenografts (n = 7 for each group).
  Error bars represent the SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. PCa prostate cancer,
  IHC immunohistochemistry.
