caption: Activation of the STING (stimulator of the interferon genes) pathway partially
  reversed the inhibitory effects of GSDME (gasdermin E) deficiency on vascular inflammation
  and atherogenesis. Beginning at 5 weeks of age, ApoE−/− (apolipoprotein E-deficient)
  and Gsdme−/−/ApoE−/− (Gsdme- and apolipoprotein E-deficient) mice were administered
  a WD (Western diet). Starting at 14 weeks, these mice were injected intraperitoneally
  with either SR-717 or PBS (phosphate buffer saline) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg daily
  until they reached 18 weeks of age, at which point aortic examinations were performed;
  (A) representative images display the murine aortic root in situ, and representative
  histological sections stained with HE (hematoxylin and eosin), scale bars indicating
  500 µm; (B) representative images of immunofluorescence staining for EGF-like module-containing
  mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 (F4/80+, red) and 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI, blue), scale bars indicating 500 µm; (C) quantitative statistical analysis
  of HE staining, n = 10; (D) quantitative statistical analysis of F4/80+ immunofluorescence
  staining, n = 10. (E) Representative Western blot image shows adhesion molecule
  expression levels for ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1), chemokine MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), and
  β-actin; (F–H) quantification of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCP-1 normalized to β-actin,
  respectively, n = 6; (I) representative image of the Western blot analysis of phosphorylated
  and total levels of STING, TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), IRF3 (interferon regulatory
  factor-3), NF-κB p65 (nuclear factor kappa-B p65)), and β-actin, with (J–M) relative
  quantifications of phosphorylated-to-total ratios for STING, TBK1, IRF3, and NF-κB
  p65, n = 6.
