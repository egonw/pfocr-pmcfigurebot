caption: Proposed model of UPR induction, mutation structural impact and GLA residual
  activity. In wild type condition, α-Gal A enters the secretory pathway to reach
  its lysosomal localization. At steady state the protein is almost completely localized
  in the lysosome and active. Misfolded mutants reported to have residual activity
  and low structural impact are partially ER retained inducing ER stress and UPR to
  an extent that is inversely correlated with ER retention and residual enzymatic
  activity. Mutants shown to have high structural impact and no residual activity
  are fully retained in the ER and induce robust ER stress and UPR.
