figure_title: NBL1 participates in the NSE-mediated stem cell-like characteristics
  of SCLC
caption: A Sphere-formation capability of NSE-overexpressing SCLC cells followed by
  NBL1 overexpression (original magnification ×20, scale bar 100 μm). B Quantitative
  analysis of spheroid cells in various subgroups. Data are presented as mean values ± SD
  for three independent experiments. C The stemness property of NSE-overexpressing
  SCLC cells followed by NBL1 overexpression was detected by the Extreme Limiting
  Dilutions Analysis. D The protein levels of multiple stemness-related genes were
  analyzed in H446 cells with overexpressed NSE, with or without NBL1 overexpression
  compared to the control cells, and the relative protein expression (protein/β-actin)
  was quantified in a column graph (E). F The total protein content of Smad1, pSmad1/5/8,
  ID1, and β-actin in H446 cells with overexpressed NSE, with or without NBL1 overexpression
  compared to the control cells. G The bar chart showed the protein expression of
  total Smad1, pSmad1/5/8, and ID1, which was normalized to β-actin. H Cell proliferation
  was assessed using CCK8 assay. The pro-proliferation ability of NSE overexpression
  was counteracted by NBL1 overexpression. The tumorigenicity of NSE-overexpressing
  cells was diminished by NBL1 overexpression. I Tumor volumes were assessed every
  3 days until 24 days after tumor cell injection. J Tumor tissues derived from nude
  mice inoculated tumor cells were displayed. K Tumor weights were examined on day
  24 and displayed as a histogram. L Relative changes in the mRNA levels of CgA, ProGRP,
  and CYFRA21-1 in H446 cells overexpressing NSE. M The mRNA levels of CgA, ProGRP,
  and CYFRA21-1 in H69 cells with silenced NSE were detected by qRT-PCR. N Bar charts
  showing significant differential expression of CgA, ProGRP, and CYFRA21-1 in H446
  cells with elevated NBL1 expression. Data are represented as mean ± SD for three
  experiments. The level of significance is indicated by *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
