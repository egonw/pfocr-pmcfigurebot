caption: 'Pretreatment with ZER alleviates pathological tissue damage in SAP-induced
  rats. (A) Histopathological changes in the rat pancreas of each treatment group
  were examined by H&E staining (×200). (B) Histological score of pancreatic pathology
  in each group of rats. (C) Changes in the wet-to-dry ratio (W/D) of lungs in each
  group of rats. (D) Changes in serum amylase (AMY) levels in each group of rats.
  (E) Measurement of abdominal water volume in each group of rats. (F) Changes in
  serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in each group of rats. (G) Changes in
  serum creatinine (Cr) levels in rats in each treatment group. ***P < 0.001, compared
  with CON group, #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001, compared with the SAP group'
