caption: Outline of degradative and secretory autophagy pathways. Various stressors
  stimulate mTORC1 and AMPK, upstream signaling molecules of autophagy, which phosphorylate
  the ULK1 complex. The ULK1 complex sequentially activates the VPS34 complex, which
  generates PI3P at membrane sources and initiates autophagosome formation. With the
  aid of autophagic receptors, cargos are recruited to the autophagosomes. In the
  degradative autophagy pathway, the autophagosomes are fused with lysosomes, and
  their cargos are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. In the secretory autophagy pathway,
  autophagosomes escape the lysosomal degradation pathway and move to the cell periphery
  and fuse with the plasma membrane. The key inflammatory signaling molecules, such
  as interleukins, are released into the extracellular environment. Detailed mechanisms
  are described in the text.
