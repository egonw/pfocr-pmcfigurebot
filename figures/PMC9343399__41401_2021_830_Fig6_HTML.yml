figure_title: ACY1 exerted an important role in Rg3 inhibiting myocardial fibrosis
  and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in Ang II-treated MCFs
caption: 'a Representative Western blotting analysis of the expression of collagen
  III, collagen I, p-Smad3, and Smad3 in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with ACY1-plasmid,
  control-plasmid or Rg3 (n = 3). b Representative immunofluorescence analysis of
  the expression of TGF-β1 in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with ACY1-plasmid, control-plasmid,
  or Rg3 (n = 3). c Representative Western blotting analysis of the expression of
  collagen III, collagen I, p-Smad3, and Smad3 in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with
  ACY1-siRNA, control-siRNA, or Rg3 (n = 3). d Representative immunofluorescence analysis
  of the expression of TGF-β1 in Ang II-induced MCFs treated with ACY1-siRNA, control-siRNA,
