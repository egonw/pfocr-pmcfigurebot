caption: DeltaN p63 regulates EMT through PTEN. (a) R language toolkit to analyse
  the correlation between p63 and related gene expression. (b) WB detecting the expression
  of PTEN protein after knockdown or overexpress deltaN p63. (c) WB detecting the
  expression of EMT pathway protein after overexpression of deltaN p63 and/or PTEN.
  (d) CCK-8 analysis of cell growth after overexpression of deltaN p63 and/or PTEN.
  (e) Flow cytometric detection of apoptosis after overexpression of deltaN p63 and/or
  PTEN. (f) Transwell detection of metastasis after after overexpression of deltaN
  p63 and/or PTEN.
