caption: 'Representative electron micrographs of ultra-thin sections from the left
  ventricle of the myocardium in the different experimental groups: (a) Group I (control
  group) showed normal sarcomere with well-organized myofibrils (F), a dark band (A),
  and light bands (I) intersected by Z lines. The A band had an H zone, which was
  crossed by the M line. A row of mitochondria (Mi) and the nucleus (N) were seen;
  (b) Group IIa (DOX/Trz group) showed disrupted and disorganized myofibrils (F) with
  areas of fibril loss (arrowhead), distorted mitochondria (Mi), and an irregular
  nucleus (N) with heterochromatin margination (HC). Wide separation of the fibril
  bundles (W) with vacuoles (V) and interrupted intercalated disc (ID) were observed;
  (c) Group IIb (recovery group) showed disrupted and disorganized myofibrils (F)
  with areas of fibril loss (arrowhead), distorted mitochondria (Mi), and irregular
  nucleus (N) with heterochromatin margination (HC), as well as wide separation of
  the myofibril bundles (W) with vacuoles and areas of fibrosis (*); (d) Group III
  (prophylactic group) showed sarcomere with organized myofibrils (F), a dark band
  (A), light bands (I), Z lines, and M line, as well as normal mitochondria (Mi) and
  part of the nucleus (N). A slight separation of a few myofibrils bundles was noticed
  (W); and (e) Group IV (curative group) showed well-organized myofibrils (F) with
  transverse striation patterns, Z lines, and M lines. Some myofibrils appeared disrupted
  with areas of lost fibrils (arrowhead). The mitochondria (Mi) appeared in different
  sizes and shapes. Separation of some myofibrils bundles (W) was observed. TEM, transmission
  electron microscopy (Ã—3000); n = 4.'
