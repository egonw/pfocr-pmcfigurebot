caption: Anlotinib combined with 5-FU inhibits migration and invasion in the H446
  cells. And the cells were fixed in 20% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal
  violet. (a) The effect of anlotinib (5 μM) and 5-FU (10 μM) or combination of both
  on cell migration evaluated by wound healing methods in the H446 cells. (b) The
  effect of anlotinib (5 μM) and 5-FU (10 μM) or combination of both on cell invasion
  evaluated by transwell assays in the H446 cells. The results are from the three
  independent experiments.∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with anlotinib.
