figure_title: High RECQL4 expression correlates with increased recombination, mutations,
  and tumorigenesis
caption: (A) RECQL4 expression is elevated in tumors in comparison to adjacent normal
  tissue. RNAseq data from tumors and normal tissue matched samples was acquired from
  TCGA. The data was normalized by transcripts per million (TPM), then analyzed for
  RECQL4 expression. Box and whisker plots graph the median of the data alongside
  the 25th and 75th percentile. The number of samples alongside p-value are shown
  using Mann-Whitney U test. (B) RECQL4 expression is higher in ER- breast cancer.
  Transcriptome data from TCGA (RNA-seq) and METABRIC (microarray) was analyzed for
  RECQL4 expression in ER- (blue) and ER+ (red) cancers. Log2 (TPM+1) and normalized
  probe intensity were used respectively. Box and whisker plots alongside each data
  point was graphed. The number of samples alongside p-value are shown using Mann-Whitney
  U test. (C) Elevated levels of RECQL4 are associated with increased tumor mutation
  burden. The expression of RECQL4 in ER- breast tumors from TCGA was divided into
  quartiles based upon expression level. The mutation burden between the least expressing
  tumors (Quartile 1 –Q1, blue) and the highest expressing tumors (Quartile 4 –Q4,
  red) was analyzed. Box and whisker plots alongside each data point was graphed.
  The number of samples alongside p-value are shown. Annotated mutational data from
  ER- breast cancer was acquired from Firebrower. The mutational data was categorized
  using “maftools” in R. Tumor mutation burden was scored as described (Wang et al
  2019). Significance was determined by Mann-Whitney U test. (D) High expression of
  RECQL4 correlates with enrichment of DNA repair, G2M checkpoint, MYC Targets V1,
  E2F Targets 1 and 2 in TNBC. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed on
  TNBC gene expression data from both TCGA and METABRIC using the 50 Hallmark gene
  sets from MSigDB. Correlation between TCGA and METABRIC datasets was plotted for
  enriched pathways. (E) Homologous recombination and RAD51 is enriched in TNBC tumors
  expressing high levels of RECQL4. GVSA results of “KEGG Homologous Recombination”
  gene set (MSigDB M11675) was parsed for the top 20 DNA repair genes enriched in
  TNBC tumors expressing high levels of RECQL4. HR pathway was enriched by GSVA analysis
  in RECQL4 high expressing TNBC compared to loss expressing TBNC. Box and whisker
  plots alongside each data point was graphed. The number of samples alongside p-value
  are shown using Mann-Whitney U test. (F,G) RECQL4 expression serves as a predictor
  for clinical outcomes. High expression of RECQL4 correlates with positive response
  to cisplatin and favorable clinical outcome (Good responder). Analysis from a study
  where cisplatin was given as a neoadjuvant therapy in 24 TNBC tumors []. Lower expressing
  RECQL4 tumors are shown as blue dots and high expressing RECQL4 tumors are shown
  as red dots. Clinical response to cisplatin was measured as progressive disease
  (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (cPR), complete response (cCR). Good
  and poor responders were defined as patients with cPR/cCR status and PD/SD status
  respectively. Increased RECQL4 expression correlates with a good clinical response
  as determined by Mann-Whitney U test. Pathological response to cisplatin was monitored
  by Miller Payne metric score (grade 1 is no significant tumor reduction and grade
  5 is compete tumor reduction) and graphed based on RECQL4 expression. Good and poor
  responders were defined as patients with a Miller Payne Score of 4–5 or 0–3 respectively.
  Increased RECQL4 expression correlates with a good pathological response as determined
  by Mann-Whitney U test.
