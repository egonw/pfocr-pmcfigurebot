figure_title: CD5+ PD-L1+ regulatory B cells contract during early response to infection
caption: (A) Baseline (BL) and day 35 (D35+) example plots of a patient’s CD5+ PD-L1+
  regulatory B cell response. These cells were gated from the total naïve (CD27-)
  B cell population and their frequencies compared relative to HIV status. (B) This
  response was tracked longitudinally and relative to disease severity (ordinal scale
  1–3) and controls denoted as ‘C’. In (C) the corresponding CD4+ T follicular helper
  (Tfh) response was tracked longitudinally. Error bars indicate standard deviation
  (HIV- n = 37; HIV+ n = 33). Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis
  H test for multiple comparisons and Mann-Whitney for disease severity. p Values
  are denoted by *≤0.05; **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
