caption: 'A mechanistic model of chaperone-mediated non-equilibrium protein folding
  that couples the state cycle of the chaperone and the conformational dynamics of
  its substrate. The chaperone undergoes a cycle of open and closed conformations,
  driven by ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. The protein substrate can transition
  among four classes of conformations: Misfolded (M), Misfold-tending (U), Native-tending
  (F), and Native (N). The lengths of the reaction arrows signify the corresponding
  reaction rates. The red arrows indicate the predominant folding pathway.'
