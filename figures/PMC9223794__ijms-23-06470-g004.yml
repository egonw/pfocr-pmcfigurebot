caption: WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways increased in metastasis p-EMT cluster and
  eCAF/myCAF clusters. (A) Significant WNT signaling pathway communications upregulated
  in metastasis conditions between p-EMT cluster and eCAF/myCAF clusters (with compared
  non-metastasis condition). (B) Significant NOTCH signaling pathway communications
  upregulated in metastasis condition between p-EMT cluster and eCAF/myCAF clusters
  (with compared non-metastasis condition). (C) WNT and NOTCH signaling pathway-related
  gene expressions in integrated single-cell RNA-seq of fibroblasts and epithelial
  cells in non- vs. metastasis conditions.
