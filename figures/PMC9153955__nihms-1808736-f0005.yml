caption: Metabolic pathways enriched by the metabolic features unique to saliva. The
  cells are shaded according to strength of association (i.e., p value) between each
  of metabolic pathways and significant features that were associated with each indoor/outdoor
  single traffic pollutant indicator. Pathways are ordered according to the total
  number of the significant pathway-traffic pollutant pairs (p < 0.05) in both columns.
  Each pathway is enriched by at least 3 significant annotated unique features.
