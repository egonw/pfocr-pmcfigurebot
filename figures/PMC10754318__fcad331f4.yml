caption: 'mRNA ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) canonical pathways analysis. A bar
  chart displaying the top-20 significant diseases and biological function groups
  generated in IPA using the short versus long disease duration differentially expressed
  mRNA gene list. Blue bars—negative z-score indicating inhibition. Orange bars—positive
  z-score indication activation. Sample size n = 20 long, n = 22 short. Key: IRF,
  interferon-regulatory factor, UVB; ultraviolet B, MAPK; mitogen-activated protein
  kinase. This image was created with BioRender.com.'
