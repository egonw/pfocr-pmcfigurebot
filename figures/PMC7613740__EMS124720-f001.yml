figure_title: Targeted therapy resistance induces cross-resistance to immunotherapy
caption: 'a, Clinical response rate and b, Progression-free survival (PFS) of metastatic
  melanoma patients in the Lausanne Patient Cohort () receiving immunotherapy with
  checkpoint inhibitors (n = 54 patients). NTT, targeted therapy (TT) naïve patients
  (n = 38); RTT, TT (RAFi or RAFi/MEKi) resistant patients (n = 16). c, Quantification
  of T cells in tumours of NTT and RTT melanoma patients receiving MAPK pathway inhibitors
  (RAFi or RAFi/MEKi combination), assessed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of
  matched patient biopsies (n = 10 patients, ). d, Scheme outlining (1) generation
  of NTT and RTT cell lines, before therapy or after tumour relapse on treatment and
  (2) testing immunotherapy response in tumours derived from NTT and RTT cell lines.
  e, Treatment response of subcutaneously injected Braf melanoma (BrafV600E/WT Cdkn2a-/-)
  tumours continuously treated with indicated TT; arrow indicating start of therapy
  (CTRL, n = 6 tumours; other groups, n = 8). Experiment performed 3 times; representative
  example shown. f, Treatment response in mice bearing NTT and RTT Braf melanoma;
  arrows indicate immunotherapy administration (all groups, n = 8 tumours). No targeted
  therapy was administered. Experiment performed 9 times; representative example shown.
  P-value: **** 4.8E-13, ns 0.9963, ns 0.7039. g, T cells in NTT and RTT tumours of
  Braf melanoma, treated with CTRL or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 assessed by IF staining (scale
  bar 20 μm). Experiment performed twice; representative example shown. h, T cells
  in NTT and RTT tumours of Braf melanoma, treated with CTRL or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 assessed
  by flow cytometry (NTT CTRL, n = 6; NTT anti-PD-1/CTLA-4, n = 9; RTT CTRL, n = 6;
  RTT anti-PD-1/CTLA-4, n = 9 tumours). Experiment performed 3 times; representative
  example shown. P-value: * 0.0196, *** 0.0009, ns >0.9999. Data in e, f, h displayed
  as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Data analysis a one-sided chi-square test
  b two-sided log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test f two-way ANOVA h one-way ANOVA. * P < 0.05,
  *** P < 0. 001, **** P < 0. 0001, ns = non-significant.'
