caption: Electrospun PU acts as the membrane controlling drug release from the IVR.
  At pH 4.5, the PU membrane swells due to the protonation of amine groups in HEP.
  Due to swelling of the fiber, it blocks the pathway for the drug to be released
  from the IVR. When pH is increased to 7.0 (after sexual intercourse), the PU fiber
  shrinks and the drug is released from the IVR’s reservoir. (A) IVR; (B) window membrane;
