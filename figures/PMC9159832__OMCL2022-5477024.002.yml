caption: Punisher is involved in the signaling pathway of cell apoptosis and mitochondrial
  fission. (a) Hierarchical clustering analyses of 331 upregulated and downregulated
  274 genes in si-Punisher samples relative to control-siRNA (Cntl-siRNA). (b) GO
  analysis in biological process after si-Punisher transfection for 24 hours in VSMCs.
  (c) Heat map of main downstream genes that are regulated in Punisher knockdown samples.
  (d, e) Mitochondrial proteins and apoptosis proteins were determined by western
  blotting. All values are the average of at least 3 biological replicates, and data
  shown are mean Â± SD.
