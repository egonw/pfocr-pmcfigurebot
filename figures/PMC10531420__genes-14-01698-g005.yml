caption: The seasonal transcriptional regulation of genes in cellulose, galactoglucomannan,
  and xylan biosynthetic pathways for secondary wall formation. Metabolites in each
  step of the biosynthetic pathway are shown in the box, and all related genes are
  shown to the side. SUS (Sucrose Synthase); CESA (Cellulose Synthase A); UGD (UDP-Glucose
  Dehydrogenase); UGP (UDP-Glc Pyrophosphorylase); PGM (Phosphoglucomutase); UXS (UDP-Xylose
  Synthase); IRX10L (Irregular Xylem 10-Like); IRX9L (Irregular Xylem 9-Like); IRX14L
  (Irregular Xylem 14-Like); IRX7 (Irregular Xylem 7); DUF579 (Domain Of Unknown Function
  579); GUX (Glucuronic Acid Substitution Of Xylan); RWA (Reduced Wall Acetylation);
  INV (Invertase); HXK (Hexokinase); GGP (GDP-D-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase); G6PI (Glucose-6-Phosphate
  Isomerase); M6PI (Mannose-6-Phosphate Isomerase); PMM (Phosphomannomutase); GMP
  (GDP-D-Mannose Pyrophosphorylase); CSLA3 (Cellulose Synthase-Like A3); and GGT (Glucomannan-1;6-Galactosyltransferase).
  The seasonal wood formation of CW and OW was shown by the up- and down-regulated
  of each gene in SP compared to FA, indicated as the color bar (blue to black, respectively).
  The CW formation in SP was shown by the up- and down-regulated of each gene in CW
  compared to OW, indicated as the color bar (red to green, respectively). The fold
  change value was the average of two sampling sets. CW (Compression Wood), OW (Opposite
  Wood), SP (Spring), SM (Summer), and FA (Fall).
