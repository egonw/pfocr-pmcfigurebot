caption: 'EGR2 regulates the expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes in Ewing cells.
  (A) Heat map of differentially expressed genes in the A673 and SKNMC Ewing cell
  lines obtained from the mean of two siEGR2 (#1 and #2) (absolute log2FC > 0.5) and
  Western blot analysis of EGR2 expression cells for 48 h after siEGR2 or siCTL transfection.
  The volcano plot shows the differentially expressed genes in A673 and SKNMC Ewing
  cells upon siEGR2 vs. siCTL transfection. The dotted line corresponds to the absolute
  value of log2FC = 0.5 and the red dots point out mevalonate pathway genes down-regulated
  by EGR2-KD. (B) Gene Ontology and pathway analysis using the Topp-Fun Gene portal
  performed on the 280 genes down-regulated upon EGR2-KD with a log2FC < −0.5 comparing
  siEGR2 vs. siCTL. (C) Schematic representation of the mevalonate pathway. The blue
  boxes indicate the 2 rate-limiting enzymes. (D) Heat map representation of the differential
  expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes (in blue) and prenyltransferases (in green)
  in 6 Ewing cell lines after invalidation with siRNA targeting EWSR1-FLI1 (siEF1)
  for 48 h (A673 and SKNMC), 72 h (A673, TC71, CHLA10, and EW1), and 96 h (SKNMC,
  TC71, and MHHES1) and in the A673/TR/shEF1 inducible system (shEF1) treated with
  Dox for 7 days [] and parental MSC cells (MSC_Pat_R1) as well as in EWIma1 cells
  invalidated or not for 72 h by siEF1. EWIma1 was generated by engineering an EWSR1-FLI1
  translocation in a Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC_Pat_R1) []. The red box shows the
  7 enzymes commonly up-regulated by EGR2 and EWSR1-FLI1. (E) CHIP-seq profiles for
  EWSR1-FLI1, EGR2, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me3 binding to HMGCS1, HMGCR, MVK, and MVD promotors
  in the POE shEGR2_4#22 clone [] expressing a tagged EGR2 (EGR2HA). The endogenous
  EGR2 was invalidated by shRNA induced upon Dox treatment (+EGR2HA) or not (−EGR2HA).'
