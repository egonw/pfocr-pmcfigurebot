caption: miRNA expression profiling with NEM as an inhibitor for hydrogen sulfide
  pathway. (A) The third stage of a three-stage framework for integrating triple multi-omics
  data. (B) A pie chart displays 10% upregulated and 13.9% downregulated miRNAs in
  the total number of miRNAs (1976) between DMSO- and NEM-treated SW10 cells. (C)
  A scatter plot of the comparison of miRNA expression between DMSO- and NEM-treated
  SW10 cells. Upregulated and downregulated miRNAs are indicated by red dots in the
  upper region and blue dots in the lower region, respectively. Using upregulated
  miRNAs, GO terms (D), KEGG pathways (E), and Reactome analysis (F) are shown. Using
  downregulated miRNAs, GO terms (G), KEGG pathways (H), and Reactome analysis (I)
  are shown. (J) qPCR validation of top 5 upregulated and downregulated miRNAs. The
  log2 FC was shown in both RNA-sequencing (Seq) and the validation. Heatmap shows
  the relative expression levels of miRNAs. Comparisons were performed using a Studentâ€™s
  t-test. * p < 0.05.
