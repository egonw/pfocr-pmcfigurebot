figure_title: Schematic representation of the effect of NRP1 on the TGFBR2-VE-cadherin
  pathway in regulating adherens junctions and inflammatory responses
caption: (A) In ECs, NRP1 interacts with VE-cadherin and TGFBR2, reducing TGF-Î² signaling
  and stabilizing adherens junctions. NRP1 promotes VE-cadherin interaction with p120
  catenin, leading to optimal coupling of the actin cytoskeleton with the adherens
  junction complex and to alignment of the cytoskeleton to the direction of flow.
  (B) In the absence of NRP1, the interaction of NRP1 with VE-cadherin is lost and
  that of VE-cadherin with p120 catenin is reduced, leading to cytoskeleton remodeling
  and abundant cortical actin and resulting in a lack of cytoskeleton alignment to
  the flow direction. Furthermore, in ECs lacking NRP1, adherens junction destabilization
  increases the plasma membrane localization of TGFBR2, resulting in the downstream
  phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. Loss of NRP1-dependent signaling pathways results in
  EC activation, leading to increases in the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, secretion of IL6 and IL8, leukocyte rolling,
  and plaque formation in an atherosclerosis mouse model.
