caption: 'Overexpression of HOXB2 reverses the inhibitory effect of NUSAP1 knockdown
  on the proliferation of nephroblastoma cells. (A) MTT was performed to detect cell
  viability. (B) Colony formation assay was conducted to detect cell proliferation.
  (C) Statistical analysis of the results presented in (B). (D) EdU staining was performed
  to detect cell proliferation. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. shRNA-NC; ##P<0.01, vs. shRNA-NUSAP1
  + Ov-NC. HOXB2, homeobox protein Hox-B2; NUSAP1, nucleolar and spindle-associated
  protein 1; Ov, overexpression vector; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control.'
article_title: Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation,
  invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
