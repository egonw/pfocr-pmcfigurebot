caption: 'Extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and pathways are downregulated in exon
  2  −/− neurons. RNA-Seq analysis of exon 2  −/− and CTR neurons reveal suppression
  of ECM related genes and pathways in exon 2  −/− neurons. (a) GO (biological process)
  enrichment analysis reveal downregulation of collagen and ECM genes in exon 2  −/−
  neurons (res 4 and 5). (b) Heatmap visualisation of top 20 most variable genes clustered
  with complete hierarchical clustering using z-scored counts. Column annotations
  represent Aβ25–35 treatment condition and neuron genotype (CTR, A4 or D1). (c) Functional
  directionality analysis identified focal adhesion and ECM receptor interaction were
  suppressed in exon 2  −/− neurons, which was not altered by Aβ25–35 treatment. (d)
  Topology identified a significant suppression of ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt
  signalling pathways were suppressed in exon 2  −/− neurons, again unaltered by Aβ25–35.
  Figure legend outlines comparisons made in this analysis: res1; Aβ25–35 treated
  vs untreated CTR neurons, res2; Aβ25–35 treated vs untreated A4 neurons, res3; Aβ25–35
  treated vs untreated D1 neurons, res4; untreated A4 vs untreated CTR neurons, res5;
  untreated D1 vs untreated CTR neurons, res6; Aβ25–35 treated A4 vs CTR neurons and
  res7; Aβ25–35 treated D1 vs CTR neurons. Differential gene expression satisfied
  thresholds for both fold change (> 1.5) and adjusted p value (< 0.05) were included
  in this analysis. Numbers of each res represent the number of differentially expressed
  genes enriched in each pathway for each comparison. Gene set enrichment satisfied
  adjusted p value (< 0.05). NES (enrichment score normalised to mean enrichment of
  random samples of the same size). tA the observed total perturbation accumulation
  in the pathway, pPERT probability to observe a total accumulation more extreme than
  tA only by chance. pPERT* < 0.05, ** < 0.01 and *** < 0.001.'
