caption: 'Molecular regulation of the postnatal cranial base synchondrosis. PTHrP-Ihh
  feedback regulates activity of proliferating chondrocytes until their differentiation
  into pre-hypertrophic cells. Prickle, a component of the Wnt/PCP pathway, directs
  asymmetric division of resting cells into adjacent columnar chondrocytes. Fgfr1,
  Fgfr2 and Fgfr3 expression in proliferating chondrocytes directly controls cranial
  base elongation. Activating mutations in each receptor are associated with various
  forms of syndromic craniosynostoses, which commonly present midfacial hypoplasia.
  Evc2 expression is localized in a gradient-like fashion, wherein which levels increase
  in the anterior most portions of the SOS and ISS are indirectly regulated through
  Hedgehog signaling. This relationship instructs posterior-to-anterior differentiation
  and eventual mineralization of cranial base chondrocytes in addition to formation
  of the segmented cranial base bones. Ddr2 expression is found in a gradient fashion,
  with highest levels localized to resting cells. Currently established in the long
  bone growth plate, Fgfr3-Mapk-Runx2 signaling is a critical component regulating
  both chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. Whether this relationship exists
  in the cranial base synchondrosis remains to be elucidated. ISS: inter-sphenoid
  synchondrosis, SOS: spheno-occipital synchondrosis, R: resting zone, P: proliferating
  zone, H: hypertrophic zone, PS: primary spongiosa.'
