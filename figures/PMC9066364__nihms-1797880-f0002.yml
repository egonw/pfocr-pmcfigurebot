caption: Identification of genomic features relevant for treatment in tumors. A, Transcriptional
  signatures were used to identify tumor tissues with increased MAPK signaling, proliferation,
  mTOR signaling, immune infiltration, and BRCAness. Of 61 patients, 14 did not have
  a gene signature associated with a response to an existing therapy. Analysis of
  DEGs between these patients and the remaining members of the cohort found an upregulation
  of ADH1B gene (B) that corresponds to worse patient prognosis, and pathway analysis
  revealed that these patients had increased DEGs associated with immune response
  pathways (C). We calculated whether MAPK (P = 0.188), mTOR (P = 0.504), and/or WNT
  (P < 0.001) signaling were correlated to T-cell infiltration (D). E, A more detailed
  analysis of specific immune cell types showed WNT signaling activity was inversely
  correlated with infiltration of cytotoxic cells (P < 0.01), NK cells (P < 0.001),
  and M1 macrophages (P < 0.05).
