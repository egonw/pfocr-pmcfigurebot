caption: 'iNOS expression in phrenic motoneurons following C2 hemi-section. (A) Representative
  images showing expression of iNOS in phrenic motoneurons labeled with CTB in uninjured
  animals and in denervated phrenic motoneurons in C2 hemisected rats, 3 and 7 days
  post-injury (P.I.). (B) Quantification of iNOS in phrenic motoneurons for uninjured
  animals, and intact and injured sides of C2 hemisected animals 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and
  7 d following injury. # 3 d P.I. injured side, compared with uninjured group, p
  < 0.05. * Compared to uninjured group and 1 h P.I. corresponding side, p < 0.05.'
