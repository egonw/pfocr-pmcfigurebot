caption: 'Representative photomicrographs of Masson’s trichrome-stained sections from
  the left ventricle of the myocardium in the different experimental groups: (a) Group
  I (control group) showed minimal collagen fibers between cardiac muscle fibers (double
  arrow); (b) Group IIa (DOX/Trz group) showed moderate collagen fiber deposition
  among cardiac muscle fibers (double arrow); (c) Group IIb (recovery group) showed
  marked collagen fiber accumulation between cardiac muscle fibers (double arrow);
  (d) Group III (prophylactic group) showed minimal collagen fiber deposition among
  cardiac muscle fibers (double arrow); (e) Group IV (curative group) showed few collagen
  fibers among cardiac muscle fibers (double arrow); and (f) Histogram representing
  the mean area percentage of collagen fibers in all experimental groups. **, significant
  compared to Group I at p ˂ 0.01; ##, significant compared to Group II at p ˂ 0.01;
  n = 6.'
