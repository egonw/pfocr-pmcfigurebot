caption: 'LRFN2 expression is decreased in esophageal cancer tissues. (A, B) Both
  the mRNA and protein expression of LRFN2 in ESCC tissues was markedly decreased
  compared with normal tissues. *p < 0.05. (C) In TCGA database, LRFN2 expression
  was decreased in squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared with normal tissues. (D)
  qPCR was used to detect LRFN2 mRNA expression in 67 ESCC tissues and adjacent nontumor
  tissues. (E) Based on the mRNA expression of LRFN2, 67 samples were divided into
  two groups: a high expression group (n = 34) and a low expression group (n = 33).
  Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression group had a better
  prognosis. (F) Based on the protein expression of LRFN2, 67 samples were divided
  into two groups: a high expression group (n = 34) and a low expression group (n = 33).
  Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression group had a better
  prognosis. *p < 0.05.'
