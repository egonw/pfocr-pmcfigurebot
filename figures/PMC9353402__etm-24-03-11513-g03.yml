caption: Overall Masson staining and infarct size of the rat heart in the N group,
  and 2 weeks after myocardial infarction in the LINS group, LIIL group and LIILR
  group. Masson staining showing myocardial tissue fibrosis in rats. Cardiomyocytes
  were stained in bright red, collagen in dark blue. (A) Overall Masson staining of
  the N group. (B) Magnified Masson staining of the N group. (C) Overall Masson staining
  of the LINS group. (D) Overall Masson staining of the LINS group. (E) Magnified
  Masson staining of the LIIL group. (F) Magnified Masson staining of the LIIL group.
  (G) Magnified Masson staining of the LIILR group. (H) Magnified Masson staining
  of the LIILR group. (I) Quantification of infarct size percentage in each rat group.
  (J) Quantification of collagen content percentage in each rat group. Left column
  scale bar, 1 mm; right column scale bar, 80 µm. N group, n=20; LINS group, n=13;
  LIIL group, n=10; LIILR group, n=18. N group, normal control group; LINS group,
  LAD ligation with an injection of normal saline; LIIL group, LAD ligation with an
  injection of IL-6 recombinant protein; LIILR group, LAD ligation with injection
  of IL-6 receptor inhibitor group.
