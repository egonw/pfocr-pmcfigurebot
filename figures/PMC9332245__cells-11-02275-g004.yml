caption: 'ROS homeostasis regulated by CERK-mediated immune signaling plays a crucial
  role during fungusâ€“plant interactions. In this figure, the chitin-induced particles
  CERK, LysM, CEBiP, BIK1, and ROPs/RACs and GEF-mediated ROS homeostasis by regulation
  of NOX activity, perhaps perform vital roles in plant response to FHB. In Arabidopsis,
  a chitin elicitor receptor kinase CERK1, and a LysM-containing receptor-like kinase
  LYK5 were found to be able to bind chitin and form a chitin-dependent immune complex,
  CERK1-LYK5 [,], in which AtCERK1 is involved in activating BIK1 by phosphorylation
  directly. The activated BIK1 (GTP-BIK1) directly phosphorylates AtRbohD and enhances
  ROS production for defense responses [,]. In rice, a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like
  kinase OsCERK1 is associated with receptor-like kinase OsCEBiP under chitin treatment
  []. In addition, OsCEBiP can form a homodimer upon chitin binding that is followed
  by heterodimerization with OsCERK1, creating a signaling-active sandwich-type receptor
  system [,]. Then, OsGEF1, a regulator functioning as a molecular switch, is phosphorylated
  by OsCERK1 []. The activated OsGEF1, coupling with OsRACK1 [] in turn, phosphorylates
  a ROP/RAC GTPase, OsRAC1, and changes it from the inactive form RAC-GDP to the active
  form RAC-GTP [,]. Finally, the actived OsRAC1 then activates OsRbohB (OsNOX1) for
  ROS production by directly interacting with the N-terminus of NADPH oxidase [,].
  Additionally, a wall-associated kinases WAK2A-800 performed a positive role in response
  to Fg through a chitin-induced pathway. More importantly, silencing TaWAK2A-800
  reduced the expression levels of the chitin-triggering marker genes TaCERK1, TaRLCK1B,
  and TaMAPK3 under treatment with Fg []. MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of WRKYs was
  a exciter, which promoted the downstream signalings: the activated WRKYs then bind
  to and regulate the expression of NOX/RBOH genes [].For example, TaWRKY19 repressed
  plant immunity against pathogens by negatively regulating the transcriptional level
  of TaNOX10 and compromising ROS generation in wheat []. In addition, Ca2+signaling
  was central to both pattern- and effector-triggered immunity activation of the immune
  system in plants []. Moreover, CDPKs, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, can directly interact
  with and activate NOXs/RBOHs for ROS production, which plays a crucial role in plant
  defense responses to pathogens. Therefore, under pathogen stimulation, plant cells
  often elevate the levels of ROS to implement plant immunity by eliminating compromised
  host cells, in turn limiting the further infection by the pathogen. At the same
  time, H2O2, the precursor of ROS, plays a crucial role during cell wall rigidification
  (lignification and crosslinking of cell wall monomers) []. On the other hand, plant
  cells also enhance the expression levels of peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase
  (SOD), and catalase (CAT) to scavenge ROS and maintain the redox balance in plant
  cells. CERK1: a plasma membrane-localized chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1; LYP4/6:
  receptor-like OsLYP4 and OsLYP6; CEBiP: receptor-like kinases; LKY5: LysM-containing
  receptor-like kinase 5; GEF: guanine nucleotide exchange factors; RAC1-GTP: a subfamily
  of Rho-type GTPases; RACK: receptor for activated C-kinase; CDPK: calcium-dependent
  protein kinase; BIK1: botrytis-induced kinase 1; PBL1: PBS-like kinase, which is
