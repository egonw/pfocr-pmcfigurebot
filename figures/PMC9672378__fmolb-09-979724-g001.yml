caption: The Notch signaling pathway. The basic components of the Notch signaling
  pathway are shown. Canonical Notch ligands DLL1, DLL4, JAG1 and JAG2 in a signal-sending
  cell contact heterodimeric Notch receptors (e. g. NOTCH1) in a signal-receiving
  cell to initiate Notch signaling. Binding of ligand to NOTCH1 is regulated by O-glycans
  on EGF repeats of the Notch ECD and induces a conformational change that exposes
  a juxta-membrane cleavage site for the metalloprotease ADAM10. The released Notch
  ECD is endocytosed into the signal-sending cell. The transmembrane remnant of NOTCH1
  is then cleaved within the membrane by gamma-secretase. The released Notch ICD transits
  to the nucleus where it combines with RBP-Jκ/CSL and transcriptional activators
  including MAML1 to form a complex that recognizes RBP-Jκ/CSL DNA binding sites in
  many target genes, thereby activating transcription. Notch signaling target genes
  include transcriptional suppressors like Hes and Hey family genes and transcriptional
  activators like c-Myc. NRR, Notch regulatory domain; HD, heterodimerization domain.
