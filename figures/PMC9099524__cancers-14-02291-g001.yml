caption: HIF-1α pathway. In normoxia (left), HIF-1α is hydroxylated by PHDs to be
  recognized by VHL, which adds ubiquitin units to send HIF-1α to the proteosome to
  be degraded. In hypoxia (right), PHDs are inactivated and HIF-1α is translocated
  to the nucleus, forming a dimmer with HIF-1β to induce the transcription of several
  target genes. VEGF, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; EPO, erythropoietin; LDH,
  Lactate Dehydrogenase; TGF-β, Transforming Growth Factor β; CAIX, Carbonic Anhydrase
  9; MMP2, Matrix Metallopeptidase 2; GLUT1, Glucose transporter 1.
