caption: 'The pathway for HFA incorporation into triacylglycerol (TAG). Following
  synthesis of HFA from 18:1 esterified on phosphatidylcholine (PC) by the FAH12 hydroxylase,
  HFA is released by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). A longchain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS)
  is then necessary to synthesize HFA-CoA as the substrate for the three acyltransferases
  of TAG synthesis. See text for details. Abbreviations: DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase;
  GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 9; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase;
  PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase.'
