caption: Structural and kinetic characterizations of CCDC-PA system. (A) The working
  model of CDCC formation by charge-charge interaction. (B) Multi-foamy structures
  of CCDC under a bright-field microscope at 10× magnification and (C) Encapsulation
  of PA by CCDC. Scale bars were 10 μm. (D) Encapsulation efficiency validated using
  UV-Vis spectrometry. (E) Profile of cumulative percentage of PA released from the
  CCDC system at various pH conditions for 24h.
