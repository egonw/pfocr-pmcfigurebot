caption: miR-196-5p/HAND1/β-catenin axis regulates cell proliferation and EMT process
  in HuCCT1. (a) Western blot of protein expression of HAND1, proliferation maker
  Ki67, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in HuCCT1 with representative images of protein
  bands for each panel. (b) HuCCT1 was stained with anti-β-catenin antibody (red)
  and DAPI (blue). Pink color indicates the overlap of red and blue colors. White
  arrows point to the translocation of β-catenin expression from membrane to nuclear,
  which indicates the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Scale bars, 10
  μm.
