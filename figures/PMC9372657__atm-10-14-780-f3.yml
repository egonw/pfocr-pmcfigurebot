caption: 'Decreasing the expression of miR-194 causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through
  the CnA/NFATc2 pathway. (A) The levels of miR-194 in cells transfected with miR-194
  NC and miR-194 inhibitor. (B) The expression levels of CnA protein in each group.
  (C-E) The nuclear translocation of the NFATc2 protein in each group of cells. (F)
  Comparison of the surface area in each group of cells by immunofluorescence staining
  (Ã—400). *, P<0.05 vs. NC group; #, P<0.05 vs. miR-194 inhibitor group; +, P<0.05
  vs. siCnA group. miR, microRNA; CnA, calcineurin A; NFATc2, nuclear factor of activated
  T cells c2; NC, negative control; si, small interfering; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase.'
