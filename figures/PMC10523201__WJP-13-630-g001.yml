caption: 'Construction and bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed miRNA
  libraries. A: Volcano diagram showing that miRNA-320e was significantly downregulated;
  B: High-throughput sequencing of plasma exosomes showed that the expression of miR-320e
  was significantly downregulated; C: Bioinformatics suggested the biological processes
  involved in differentially expressed miRNAs. Further information was shown in the
  Supplementary Material.'
