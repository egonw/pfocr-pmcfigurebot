caption: DJ-1 interacts with CDK 4. (A). CDS of CDK1-8 agarose gel electrophoresis.
  (B) DJ-1 and CDK plasmids with GFP tag were co-transfected in 293 cells, and the
  protein interaction could be revealed by the specific complementation of the fluorescent
  probe and the resulting green fluorescence emission. (C) the BiFC schematic of CDK4
  and DJ1. (D, E). The CDK plasmids with Flag tag were transfected in 293 cells, and
  the interaction of CDK4 with DJ-1 was confirmed by Co-IP. Exogenous DJ-1 with flag
  was expressed in 293 cells and found to be interacted with CDK4. (F-I). The pull-down
  results of endogenous DJ-1 and endogenous CDK4 in MG63 and U2OS cells were confirmed
  by Co-IP. The Original uncut western bands are shown in .
