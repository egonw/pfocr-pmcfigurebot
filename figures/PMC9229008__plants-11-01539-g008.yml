caption: 'EkAACT overexpression further promotes the expression of genes related to
  the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and triterpene accumulation under stress. (a,b), Expression
  level detection of related genes in response to 200 mM NaCl and 20% PEG treatment.
  Expression levels of genes are represented as expression relative to a WT that was
  set to 1.0. (c,d), Changes in the total triterpenoid contents in response to stress
  treatment. WT: wild-type Arabidopsis; L2, L3 and L6: transgenic Arabidopsis lines.
  All data are the mean ± SE of three biological replicates. “*” and “**” indicate
  a significant difference from that of the WT at p ≤ 0.05 and ≤0.01, respectively,
  by Student’s t-test.'
