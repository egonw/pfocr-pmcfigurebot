caption: Gene expression profiling of MdDEP1-transgenic apple plantlets with RNAseq
  compared to the WT apple plantlets. A-B. Venn diagram analysis of common upregulated
  (A) and downregulated (B) genes (DEG; − 1.5 > logFC> 1.5; FDR < 0.01). C-D. Expression
  changes of genes involved in the photosynthetic pathway in WT vs TRV-MdDEP1 (C)
  and WT vs MdDEP1 (D), respectively. Red boxes, up-regulated genes; green boxes,
  down-regulated genes. E-F. Heat map showing selected differentially expressed genes
  with log2fold change scale. Means of three experiments are shown; complete data
  are given in  and . E. Positive regulator genes of leaf senescence. F. Negative
  regulator of leaf senescence and PSI and PSII genes
