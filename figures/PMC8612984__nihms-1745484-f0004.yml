figure_title: BBK32 R248 and K327 are critical for complement inhibitory activity
  of BBK32
caption: A) ELISA-based complement activation assays were performed to determine the
  ability of BBK32-C mutants to inhibit the classical pathway of complement in vitro.
  A two-fold concentration series of each BBK32-C mutant was used and performed in
  duplicate. Inhibitory data for additional site-directed mutants are presented in
  . IC50 values and 95% confidence intervals associated with a normalized four-parameter
  dose-inhibition fitting procedure are shown in . B) Western blots of lysates from
  B. burgdorferi strains B314 containing distinct bbk32 alleles were probed with monoclonal
  antibodies to BBK32 (Î±-BBK32) or FlaB (a-FlaB), the latter as a loading control.
  Vector refers to the plasmid only backbone sample (B314/pBBE22luc), BBK32 is the
  wildtype bbk32 construct (B314/pCD100), R248A is the bbk32-R248A isolate (B314/pAP5),
  K327A is the bbk32-K327A isolate (B314/pAP6), and R248A-K327A is the bbk32-R248A-K327A
  double mutant (B314/pAP7). Numbers on the left refer to the molecular mass of markers
  (in kDa). C) BBK32 mutant proteins were tested for their ability to confer resistance
  to normal human serum (NHS). The serum sensitive strain B314 was transformed separately
  with vector only (black), wildtype bbk32 (blue), bbk32 R248A (green), bbk32 K327A
  (purple), and bbk32 R248A-K327A (red) and incubated with NHS. Sensitivity was scored
  as a ratio of the affected cells relative to the total cells viewed via darkfield
  microscopy. Heat inactivated NHS (hiNHS) was used as a control (right). P-values
  between bbk32 samples are indicated above. Statistical significance was assessed
  using a two-way ANOVA.
