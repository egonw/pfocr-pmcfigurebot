caption: 'PERK pathway‐induced ER stress response mechanism depends on stress level.
  (A) The relative cell number and (B) the relative caspase 3/7 activity were followed
  in a case of low (light gray column, 0.1 μm thapsigargin for 2 h) and high (dark
  gray column, 10 μm TG thapsigargin for 2 h) levels of ER stress in HEK293T. (C)
  The mRNA level of key markers of PERK pathway (i.e. ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34) are
  depicted by real‐time PCR in case of low (light gray column, 0.1 μm thapsigargin)
  and high (dark gray column, 10 μm thapsigargin) level of ER stress in HEK293T for
  2 h. Control samples were not treated with any reagent (including DMSO). For each
  of the experiments, three complete biological repeat experiments were carried out.
  Error bars represent standard deviation. In the calculation of statistical significance,
  all data were compared to the untreated controls. Results are presented as mean
  values ± SD and were compared using ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple comparison post hoc
  test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from the appropriate
  control: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. TG, thapsigargin.'
