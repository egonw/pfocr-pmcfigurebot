figure_title: Rg3 decreased the content of N-acetylglutamine, increased the expression
  of ACY1, and inhibited TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in CAL-induced HF mice and
  Ang II-treated MCFs
caption: 'a The content of N-acetylglutamine in urine samples of each group mice was
  determined by LC–MS (n = 6). b The expression of ACY1 in heart tissues of each group
  of mice was determined by immunofluorescence (n = 3). c The expression of ACY1 in
  heart tissues of each group of mice was determined by immunohistochemistry (n = 3).
  d Representative Western blotting analysis of the expression of ACY1, TGF-β1, p-Smad3,
  and Smad3 in heart tissues of each group mice (n = 3). e Representative immunofluorescence
  analysis of the expression of ACY1 in Ang II-induced MCFs (n = 3). f Representative
  Western blotting analysis of the expression of ACY1, TGF-β1, p-Smad3, and Smad3
  in Ang II-induced MCFs (n = 3). #P < 0.05 vs. Sham group or Control group, ##P < 0.01
  vs. Sham group or Control group, *P < 0.05 vs. Model group or group treated with
  Ang II alone, **P < 0.01 vs. Model group or group treated with Ang II alone.'
