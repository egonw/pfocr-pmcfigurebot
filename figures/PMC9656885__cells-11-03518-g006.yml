caption: MTOR is not a molecular target of bta-miR-199a-3p. (A) TargetScan and miRWalk
  predicted the binding site of bta-miR-199a-3p to MTOR 3′-UTR. (B) The results of
  double luciferase activity detection. The miR-199a-3p mimic or mimic NC and the
  wild-type MTOR 3′-UTR luciferase reporter vector were co-transfected into 293T cells
  for double luciferase activity detection after 48 h. The relative luciferase activity
  on the ordinate represents the ratio of renilla luciferase activity to firefly luciferase
  activity. ns refers to p > 0.05.
