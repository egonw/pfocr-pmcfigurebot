figure_title: PRSS22 combined with ANXA1 regulates BC cells invasion via FPR2/ERK
  axis
caption: A, B Western blot assays showed that shRNA of ANXA1 inhibited PRSS22-activated
  phosphorylation of ERK. C, D N-terminal deletion mutant ANXA1(33â€‰kDa ANXA1) upregulation
  did not promote p-ERK1/2 expression. E, F Western blot showed that FPR2 knockdown
  reversed the high expression of p-ERK1/2 induced by PRSS22 and ANXA1 overexpression.
  G, H BC cells expressing PRSS22-R49A and PRSS22-C139A/D141E were incubated with
  the peptide AC2-26 and p-ERK1/2 expression was analyzed by Western blot. I The expression
  of PRSS22, ANXA1, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-AKT and p-p38 protein in xenograft tumors
  were detected by Western blot. J Working model of the upstream regulatory and function
  mechanisms of PRSS22 in BC progression.

  by cleaving ANXA1 and activating FPR2/ERK signaling pathway.
