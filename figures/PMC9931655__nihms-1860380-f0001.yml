figure_title: The dermal sheath expresses receptors of the endothelin signaling smooth
  muscle contraction pathway
caption: a, Schematic of regressing hair follicle illustrating apoptosis, contraction
  and movement processes during the destruction phase of the hair growth cycle. The
  epithelial progenitor pool (blue) is reduced through apoptosis in the epithelial
  strand between hair shaft (black) and dermal papilla (DP, red). Dermal sheath (DS)
  contraction at the bottleneck between epithelial strand and club hair pushes the
  shaft up and pulls the DP up. As shaft/strand/DP move up towards the stem cell reservoir
  new progenitors enter the strand keeping it at a constant length. The molecular
  mechanisms controlling DS contraction and centripetal constriction are unknown.
  b, Labeling of DS (arrowheads) and DP (arrow) with Tbx18H2BGFP;Crabp1-GFP;Lef1-RFP
  transgenic reporters. Scale bar, 50 μm. c, Isolation of DS and DP from early-stage
  regressing follicles (P16) by flow cell sorting of transgenic reporter back skin
  after immunofluorescence for PDGFRA and ITGA8. DF were isolated for comparison.
  d, Hierarchical clustering of DS, DP, DF with differentially expressed genes. N
  = 2, both replicates are shown. e, Venn diagram of gene signatures. f, DS signature
  genes in key gene categories, identifying both endothelin receptors, Ednra and Ednrb.
  g, Expression levels of receptors of the major smooth muscle contraction-regulating
  signaling pathways represented as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM).
  N = 2, data are mean with individual data points. h, DF, DP and DS expression levels
  of Ednra and Ednrb at regression onset. N = 2, data are mean with individual data
  points. i, Immunofluorescence for endothelin receptors ETA and ETB (n = 3 mice).
  ITGA8 marks the DS in regressing P17 hair follicles. Scale bar, 50 μm.
