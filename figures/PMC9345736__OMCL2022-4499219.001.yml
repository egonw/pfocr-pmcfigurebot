caption: DRD2 activation with quinpirole reduced acinar cell necroptosis during AP
  in vivo and in vitro. In vivo AP was induced by caerulein and LPS or NaT. DRD2 agonist
  quinpirole was administered intraperitoneally 0.5 h before the injection of caerulein
  or NaT. In vitro PACs were pretreated with quinpirole (5 μM) for 0.5 h and then
  stimulated with 200 nM CCK for 6h. (a) Representative graphs of H&E-stained pancreatic
  tissue (n=6~7 per group, scale bar 100 μm). (b) Histological scores from NaT-induced
  pancreatitis (n=6~7 per group). ELISA of (c) amylase and (d) lipase in serum (n=6~7
  per group). (e, f) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL
  proteins of pancreas in mice treated with NaT (n =5 in each group). (g, h) Immunoblot
  analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL proteins of pancreas in mice
  treated with caerulein and LPS (n =5 in each group). (i, j) Immunoblot analysis
  and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL proteins of pancreatic acinar cells
  with CCK stimulation (n =4 in each group). (k, l) Immunoblot analysis and quantification
  of CTSB proteins of pancreas in mice (n =3 per group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
