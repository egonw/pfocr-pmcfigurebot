caption: Efforts of ectopic TRPM4 expression on calpain substrates, cell adhesion,
  calcium channels and migration-related proteins expression. (A) TRPM4 significantly
  inhibited FAK expression and changed the key protein expression level in tumor metastasis.
  (B) TRPM4 expression significantly impeded the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
  (C) Expression of several Rho family small GTPases examined by western blot analysis
  in TRPM4-tranfectd cells and controls. (D) Ectopic TRPM4 expression activated SOCE
  and PMCA-related proteins.
article_title: A novel methylated cation channel TRPM4 inhibited colorectal cancer
  metastasis through Ca2+/Calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway.
