caption: 'Expression profiles and gene set enrichment analysis of the transcriptomes
  of mice in the obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant (OR) groups(A) Venn diagram
  of the numbers of genes in the OP and OR groups. The two groups have 27,710 shared
  genes, with 2110 and 1646 unique genes in the OP and OR groups, respectively.(B
  and C) Venn diagrams of the numbers of mRNAs (B) and lncRNAs (C) in the OP and OR
  groups. The two groups have 17,259 shared mRNAs, with 626 and 475 unique mRNAs in
  the OP and OR groups, respectively, and 10,158 shared lncRNAs, with 1457 and 1152
  unique lncRNAs in the OP and OR groups, respectively.(D) Top pathway terms ranked
  3: thermogenesis. A total of 243 genes were enriched in thermogenesis, and 118 of
  them were in the leading-edge subsets.(E) Expression of lncRNA (Gm44502) in thermogenesis
  by RNA-seq. Gm44502 expression was higher in OR mice than it was in OP mice. Values
  represent the mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 (unpaired, two-tailed
  t test, n = 3).(F–H) Thermogenesis-related pathway terms: Oxidative phosphorylation
  (F), MAPK signaling pathway (G), and cAMP signaling pathway (H). NES, normalized
  enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate.'
