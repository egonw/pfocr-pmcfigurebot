figure_title: Distinct molecular and clinical features of Wnt‐low and Wnt‐high colorectal
  cancers
caption: 'AHeatmap of the expression of CTNNB1 target genes (MsigDb pathway HALLMARK_WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING)
  in the tumor and normal tissue samples from TCGA‐COAD and TCGA‐READ cohorts (Guinney
  et al, ). Clustering into Wnt‐low (light gray) and Wnt‐high (dark gray) groups was
  performed using k‐means clustering. The bar entitled “class” indicates a normal
  tissue origin (black) or the result from CMS classification (tumor samples only,
  NA: no CMS could be assigned). TCGA tumor samples were classified into different
  consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) using RNA sequencing data and the R package CMSclassifier
  (Guinney et al, ).B AXIN2 RNA expression in TCGA samples classified into the different
  CMS as well as normal colon tissue. Represented data correspond to TCGA‐COAD and
  TCGA‐READ cohorts (Guinney et al, ). Individual data points and box plots are displayed.
  Box plots consist of the median (central line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box)
  and the highest/lowest value within 1.5 * interquartile range of the box (whiskers).
  Each data point corresponds to a different tumor or normal (tumor‐adjacent) tissue
  sample.CCorrelation between AXIN2 RNA expression and CTNNB1 protein level in samples
  from the 2019 CPTAC‐COAD proteomics cohort (Vasaikar et al, ). CMS classification
  is represented in color and is assigned according to the original publication. Protein
  level corresponds to fold change of tumor protein abundance versus adjacent normal
  tissue protein abundance.D, ETumor samples in the different CMS were ranked according
  to their AXIN2 RNA expression. Panel D depicts the AXIN2 RNA expression as a function
  of the sample rank. (E) Tile plot of TCGA tumor samples classified into the four
  CMS. Upper panel: presence of protein missense (blue) or truncating (black) mutation
  in different tumor driver and suppressor genes: RNF43, KRAS, CTNNB1, BRAF, AXIN2,
  and APC. Lower panel: Anatomical origin (proximal or distal colon, color coded)
  of tumors classified according to their DNA mismatch repair phenotype into microsatellite
  instability high (MSI‐H), microsatellite instability low (MSI‐L) or microsatellite
  stable (MSS). Proximal colon: cecum, ascending colon, hepatic and splenic flexure,
  transverse colon. Distal colon: descending and sigmoid colon. NOS: no more precise
  origin specified.F–IFrequency of cancer driver mutations in Wnt‐low (n = 106 samples)
  and Wnt‐high tumors (n = 432 samples) classified according to (A). P‐values from
  Fisher''s exact test for independence are indicated. (F) Relative frequency of tumors
  with 0, 1 or more truncating APC mutations annotated in each of the tumor groups.
  Allelic loss of APC was not considered here. (G) Relative frequency of BRAF V600E
  (blue) or other BRAF missense mutations (black). (H) Relative frequency of missense
  mutations (gray), G659Vfs*41 (blue) and other truncating (black) mutations in the
  RNF43 protein. (I) Relative frequency of missense mutations at residues G12 or G13
  (blue) or other residues (black) of the KRAS protein.JFrequency of tumor localization
  in Wnt‐low (n = 106 samples) and Wnt‐high tumors (n = 432 samples) classified according
  to (A). Colors as in (E), lower panel. P‐values from Fisher''s exact test for independence
  are indicated.'
