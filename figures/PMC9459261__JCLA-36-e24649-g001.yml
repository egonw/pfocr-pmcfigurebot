caption: Effects of HECA deficiency on downstream signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes.
  (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes after HECA knockdown. (B) Representative
  gene ontology term analysis of differentially expressed genes after HECA knockdown.
  (C) The JAK–STAT, MAPK, and PI3K‐AKT pathways showed an overlap of one gene, PDGFRB
  after HECA knockdown. (D) Differentially expressed genes in the JAK–STAT pathway,
  (E) the MAPK pathway, and (F) the PI3K‐AKT pathway were detected by qPCR.
