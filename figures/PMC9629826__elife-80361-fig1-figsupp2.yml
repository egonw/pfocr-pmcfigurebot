figure_title: Strategy to target the imaging field of view to binocular V1
caption: '(A) Size and position of the binocular zone in V1 (purple) in the left hemisphere
  relative to the center of the chronic window (+). At the widest, the binocular zone
  is 737 microns (yellow line), calculated based on data from ; ; . The distance of
  the window center from Bregma is indicated. Upper left, relative angle and scaled
  size of the imaging field of view (red). (B) Imaging field of view contains binocular
  neurons extending across the entire field. Neurons responsive to ipsilateral pathway
  stimulation (red) were identified in a pilot experiment (one animal). (C) Example
  ipsilateral-driven activity in response to full field drifting gratings (0.02 cycles/°,
  1 Hz). Individual trials (gray) and the mean (black) are shown. Angle of the stimulus
  drift is indicated (arrows). Stimulus duration, 1.5 s, is indicated in blue. Calcium
  indicator was expressed using AAV virus (pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40) in this case.
  Scale bar: 100 microns.'
