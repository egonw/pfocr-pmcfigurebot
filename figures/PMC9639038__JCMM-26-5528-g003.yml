caption: 'The effect of histone H3 and H3 antibodies on pathological changes in liver
  tissue and liver function in mice. (A) Pathological changes in the mouse liver tissue
  were observed by H&E staining. (B, C) ALT and AST serum levels in mice. The mouse
  experiment was repeated 6 times. Compared with the normal group, #p < 0.05; compared
  with the model group, &p < 0.05.'
