caption: 'GLIPR1 regulated the CD63 expression by the interaction between them. (A)
  The protein expressions of GLIPR1 and CD63 in SHC-44 cells were observed by immunofluorescence
  assay. (B) The protein expressions of GLIPR1 and CD63 in SW1783 cells were observed
  by immunofluorescence assay. Red dots referred to GLIPR1 proteins, green dots referred
  to CD63 proteins, and blue dots referred to living cells. Scale bar: 100 Âµm. NC,
  normal group; Model, model group.'
