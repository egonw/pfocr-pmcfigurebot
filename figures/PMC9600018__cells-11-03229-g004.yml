caption: 'The effect of ADSC-EXOs relied on the activation of AKT signaling pathway.
  (A) Western blot analysis of the activation of AKT, ERK, and NF-κB pathways in fibroblasts
  after treated with ADSC-EXOs at different times (n = 3). (B) Representative blots
  showing the activation of AKT and ERK pathways in fibroblasts following various
  treatments (n = 3). Fibroblasts were pre-treated with EXOs, EXOs + LY294002, or
  PBS for 24 h; then exposed under H2O2 for 6 h or CoCl2 for 24 h; and finally assessed
  by the following assays. (C) CCK8 analysis of the cell viability of fibroblasts
  under H2O2 exposure in each group. (D) CCK8 analysis of the cell viability of fibroblasts
  under CoCl2 exposure in each group. (E) Evaluation of the fibroblasts viability
  by Calcein-AM/PI staining. (F) Quantitative analysis of the data in (E). (G) Representative
  DCFH fluorescent images of fibroblasts in each group. (H) Quantitative analysis
  of the relative fluorescence intensity in (G). (I) Representative micrographs of
  migratory fibroblasts given above treatments. (J) Quantitative analysis of the data
  in (I). n = 5. Scale bar: 100 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p
  < 0.0001.'
