caption: Effect of the combined adenosine pathway knockdown, and of the P2YR2 agonist
  Diquafosol on the repair process. (A) Combined depletion of ada2b, adora1b, p2ry2.1,
  p2ry2.2 and p2ry2.3 with low concentrations of MOs significantly delayed the repair
  process (mean ± SEM; 2-way Anova). (B) Diquafosol (1 mg/mL) did not affect zebrafish
  development. (C) Diquafosol exposure for 3 h before, and for 24 h after laser-induced
  injury resulted in accelerated repair (mean ± SEM; 2-way Anova). (D) Depletion of
  zebrafish p2ry2 variants by translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MO)
  prevented the accelerating effect of Diquafosol.
