caption: The effect of cordycepin and radiation on ER stress pathway in MA-10 cells.
  MA-10 cells were treated without or with different concentrations of cordycepin
  (25 and 100 µM) and/or radiation (4 Gy) for 24 hr, respectively. GRP78, p-EIF2α,
  p-IRE1α, CHOP, ATF6β and PERK were detected by western blotting (A). The integrated
  optical densities (IOD) of GRP78, p-EIF2α, p-IRE1α, CHOP, ATF6β and PERK were normalized
  with β-actin (43 kDa) in each lane. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 indicate significant
  statistical difference compared to the control group (B-G).
