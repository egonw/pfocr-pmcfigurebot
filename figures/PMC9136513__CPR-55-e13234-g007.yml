caption: Overexpression of Mettl3 improved the osteogenic ability of OP‐BMSCs by activating
  the canonical Wnt signalling pathway in vitro. (A) Mettl3 overexpression lentivirus
  transfected into OP‐BMSCs for 72 h with an MOI value of 60. (B) Relative gene and
  protein expression of Mettl3, Runx2, Opn, Lef1, P‐Gsk‐3β and β‐Catenin were increased
  after Mettl3 overexpressing in OP‐BMSCs for osteogenic induction of 3 days. (C)
  After Mettl3 was overexpressed in OP‐BMSCs, the relative gene and protein expression
  of Mettl3, Runx2, Opn, Lef1, P‐Gsk‐3β and β‐Catenin were increased after osteogenic
  induction for 5 days. Data represent the mean ± SD (n ≥ 3). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01,
