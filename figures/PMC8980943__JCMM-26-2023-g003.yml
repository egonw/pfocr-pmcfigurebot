caption: 'IMP3 regulates endothelial cell functions through activation of VEGF/PI3K/Akt signalling
  pathway. (A) After transfection of ad‐IMP3 or ad‐RFP, protein level of VEGF, PI3K,
  PPI3K and Akt in transfected HUVECs were measured by Western blot. ACTIN was selected
  as a protein control; the relative expression of proteins were quantified as fold
  change shown in grey (n = 3). (B) After HUVECs were transfected by Si‐Vehicle or
  Si‐IMP3, the protein expression level of VEGF, PI3K, PPI3K and Akt were measured
  by western blot. ACTIN was used as a protein control; the relative expression of
  protein was quantified as fold change shown in grey. HUVECs were subjected to ad‐IMP3,
  ad‐RFP or ad‐IMP3+Axitinib (0.5 μg/ml) treatment, followed by various analysis.
  (C) CCK‐8 assay was used to measure cell viability. (D) EDU assay was used to measure
  cell proliferation. (E) TUNEL assay was used to measure apoptosis. (F) Transwell
  assay and (G) wound‐healing assay were employed for measuring cell migration ability.
  Experiments were repeated four times and the data are presented as mean ± SD. (n = 4).
