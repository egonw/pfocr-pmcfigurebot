caption: Differential expression of circRNAs in diabetic retinopathy tissues. (a)
  The scatter plot of circRNA expression of the retinal tissues from diabetes mellitus
  (DM) and control groups. The middle black line indicates that the DM and normal
  control groups present no significant difference. circRNAs beyond the top black
  line or under the bottom black line signpost >2-fold alterations. The red spots
  disclose augmented circRNAs, and the green spots reveal diminished circRNAs in the
  DR group in contrast to the control group (fold change ≥ 2.0). (b) The volcano plot
  of the circRNAs with remarkable differential expression between two groups. The
  vertical green lines represent 2.0-fold (log2 scaled) augmented and diminished changes.
  The horizontal green line refers to a p value of 0.05 (−log10 scaled). The red spots
  represent circRNAs with remarkable differential expression (fold change ≥ 2.0, p
  ≤ 0.05). (c) A number of 1063 circRNAs are significantly differentially expressed
  with ≥2-fold changes (p ≤ 0.05) in the DM group in contrast to the control group.
  There are 142 significantly upregulated circRNAs and 921 significantly downregulated
  circRNAs, including 198 novel circRNAs (red). (d) A number of 1063 circRNAs were
  probed to having a significant changed expression between two groups, and 14 circRNAs
  that presented more than 5-fold difference were delivered in this figure. The circRNAs
  with high expression were red-colored, while circRNAs with low expression were green-colored.
