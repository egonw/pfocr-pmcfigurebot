caption: 'The antitumor effect of PFGS combined with Sor on SR cells. (a) PFGS inhibited
  the viability of SR cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cell viability was investigated
  using the CKK-8 assay (n = 6). (b, c) PFGS combined with Sor inhibited the viability
  of SR cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cell viability was investigated using the
  CKK-8 assay (n = 6). (d) Invasion of SR cells in the microporous membrane of the
  Transwell chamber (n = 3). (e) The protein expression of NF-κB p65, HIF-2α, and
  SerpinB3 in SR cells (n = 3). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 compared
  with the control group; ∗∗p < 0.01 compared with the control group; &&p < 0.01 compared
  with the 6 μg/mL PFGS combined with the same concentration of Sor group; ##p < 0.01
  compared with the control group; +CDI<1 had a synergistic effect;++CDI<0.7 had a
  marked synergistic effect.'
