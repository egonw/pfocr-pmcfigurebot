caption: Overview of the effect of miR-93-5p in GC. The miR-93-5p is elevated in PCOS.
  The elevated miR-93-5p negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, inducing
  the increase of BAX and the decrease of BCL2, and finally leading the cell apoptosis.
  Additionally, when the NF-κB signaling pathway is inhibited, the transcription of
  GPX4 is declined. Then, the level of lipid peroxides is promoted. This process can
  be inhibited by ferrostatin-1 (fer-1). Lipid peroxides can be degraded into reactive
  aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA).
