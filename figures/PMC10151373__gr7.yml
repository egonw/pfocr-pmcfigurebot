caption: Proposed model of AT2 receptor mediated neurite outgrowth. The figure summarizes
  the present and some past findings related to the role of Ang II AT2 receptors in
  the mechanism of neurite elongation. We explored the participation of three different
  pathways in the neurite outgrowth induced by Ang II or CGP42112A by using specific
  inhibitors of c-Src (PP2), MEK (UO126), TrkA (AG879) and SphK (SKI-II). Besides,
  we evaluated the phosphorylation and thus activation of c-Src. Once activated, c-Src
  may enhance neurite outgrowth either directly or through the transactivation of
  TrkA receptor (this work and [,]). Moreover, activation of SphK that increases S1P
  levels (this work and []) and induction of the MEK/ERK pathway are also important
  for neurite elongation (this work and [,]). The role of SHP-1 in the AT2 receptor
  signaling pathway is also displayed since it has been demonstrated by our group
  and others [,,].
