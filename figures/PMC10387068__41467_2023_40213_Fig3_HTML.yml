figure_title: Effects of FZD5 micro-switch mutants on the WNT-3A-induced activation
  of β-catenin-dependent gene transcription
caption: 'a Schematic depiction of the TOPFlash reporter gene assay; created with
  biorender.com. b TOPFlash reporter gene response in ΔFZD1−10 HEK293T cells, transiently
  transfected with FZD5 micro-switch mutants or wild-type FZD5, upon stimulation with
  recombinant WNT-3A (300 ng/mL). Data show mean ± SEM of three independent experiments
  performed in duplicate and represent vehicle-corrected Fluc/Rluc ratios normalized
  to wild-type FZD5 (included in every experiment). Statistical differences between
  the FZD5 micro-switch mutants and wild-type FZD5 were assessed using one-way ANOVA
  followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc analysis. Significance levels are given as follows:
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. TM transmembrane domain,
  ECL extracellular loop, H8 helix 8.'
