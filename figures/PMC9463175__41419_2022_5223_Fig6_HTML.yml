caption: A The clone formation assay was used to detect the effect of CYP1B1 on cell
  proliferation. B Migration and invasion abilities affected by CYP1B1 overexpression
  were measured by transwell migration and invasion assay. Bar = 100 µm. C Migrated
  distance was calculated in CYP1B1 overexpressing and control cells in wound healing
  assay. Bar = 200 µm. D The colony formation assay was performed with MDA-MB-231
  cells transfected with si-CYP1B1 or si-NC. E, F The effect of CYP1B1 knockdown on
  migration and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were measured by transwell
  assay (E) and wound healing assay (F). G Analysis of CYP1B1 protein expression in
  breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues by immunohistochemistry. H The protein
  expression of CYP1B1 in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer samples was
  detected by immunohistochemistry. I Silencing of CYP1B1 partly reversed the effect
  of ZNF276 on cell clone formation. J Overexpression of CYP1B1 promoted cell clone
  formation ability that was inhibited by ZNF276 knockdown. K Silencing of CYP1B1
  neutralized the effect of ZNF276 on cell invasion. L Overexpression of CYP1B1 reversed
  cell invasion ability downregulated by ZNF276 inhibition. M Silencing of CYP1B1
  neutralized the effect of ZNF276 on cell migration. N Overexpression of CYP1B1 reversed
  cell migration ability downregulated by ZNF276 inhibition. O Wound healing assay
  indicating that the effect of ZNF276 on cell migration was partly reversed by CYP1B1
  knockdown. P The expression of CYP1B1 enhanced cell migration ability attenuated
  by ZNF276. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
