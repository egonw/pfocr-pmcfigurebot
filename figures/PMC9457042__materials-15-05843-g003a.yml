caption: 'Analysis of U87 (A) and Hs5 (B) cell invasion and migration after 0, 12,
  24 and 48 h of cultivation. U87 and Hs5 cells were exposed to GN and rGO flakes
  at a concentration of 25 μg/mL. Notes: For better contrast, cells were fixed and
  stained with the May Grünwald–Giemsa method. The scratch area is marked with a red
  frame. Scale bar: 1 mm. Abbreviations: rGO, reduced graphene oxide; GN, graphene;
  C, control group (untreated group); ExF, exfoliation; ATS, ammonium thiosulphate;
  TUD, thiourea dioxide.'
