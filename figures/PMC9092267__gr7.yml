caption: Whole-phosphoproteome profiling of patient LCLs (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His)(A)
  Venn diagram showing whole phosphoproteome of mutant (NP_001311.3; p.Asp32His) and
  wild-type LCLs. Note that among 1,347 (green) proteins, 425 (pink) are non-phosphorylated.
  These 425 contain 313 putative CK2 substrates motifs (shown in gray). The FC is
  >2; q value is 0.05.(B) Venn diagram showing whole phosphoproteome of NP_001311.3;
  p.Asp32His mutant and wild-type LCLs. Note that among 1,347 proteins shown in gray,
  379 are hyper-phosphorylated (shown in green). These 379 contain 231 substrates
  of CK2 (shown in pink). The FC is >2; q value is 0.05.(C) Donut graph generated
  by Funrich shows the percent of genes involved in a biological pathway. Note that
  each pathway is color coded and the key is given.(D) The diagram presents substrate
  motifs of different kinases that are hyper-phosphorylated (shown in green) and hypo-phosphorylated
  (shown in pink). The respective p values of enriched motifs are written corresponding
  to each kinase.
