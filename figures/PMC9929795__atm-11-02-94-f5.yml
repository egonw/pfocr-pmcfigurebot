caption: JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway mediates SOCS3 to regulate the death of NSCLC cells.
  (A) The inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation processed with WP1066 (50 mM) dramatically
  reduced caspase-3 expression in si-SOCS3-transfected lung cancer cells compared
  to the control cells. WP1066 treatment impaired the pro-survival effects of SOCS3
  knockdown in these lung cancer cell lines as evidenced by (B) reductions in the
  cell survival rate and (C) increases in the cell apoptosis rate. (D) TUNEL was to
  assess SOCS3 apoptosis, 200Ã—. *, P<0.05. SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; p, phosphorylated;
  t, total; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; si, small-interfering; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
  transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer.

  cell lung cancer patients to platinum-based chemotherapy.
