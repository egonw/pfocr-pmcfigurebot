caption: Illustration of the network-based integrative method used in the study. (A)
  Three NSCLC series (GSE25508, GSE19945, and GSE53882) were used for the present
  analysis. (B) The DEMs were identified using comparative approach. (C) The target
  genes associated with DEMs were identified. (D) The mRNA–miRNA network was constructed.
  (E) The significant modules based on centrality methods were detected. (F) The key
  miRNAs and their associated genes were obtained. (G) Enrichment of function and
  pathway analysis was performed for the identified key elements (key miRNAs and key
  genes). (H) Survival analysis for the obtained key genes was conducted through survival
  plots.
