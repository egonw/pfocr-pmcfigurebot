caption: 'Deletion of Ltf reduces proliferative capability of SCs. (A) Representative
  individual and merged photomicrographs of SCs sorted from WT and Ltf-KO mice; cultured
  for 4 days; and labeled with EdU, Pax7, and DAPI. Scale bars: 30 μm. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of the frequency of Pax7+EdU+ double-positive cells sorted from WT and
  Ltf-KO mice. (C) Representative individual and merged photomicrographs of SCs sorted
  from WT and Ltf-KO mice; cultured for 4 days; and co-stained with MyoD, Ki67, and
  DAPI. Scale bars: 30 μm. (D) Quantification of the number of MyoD+Ki67+ double-positive
  cells sorted from WT and Ltf-KO mice. (E) Representative merged photomicrographs
  of 48 h cultured myofibers from WT and Ltf-KO mice co-stained with MyoD, Ki67, and
  DAPI. Scale bars: 30 μm. (F) Quantification of myogenic cell number per myofiber.
  (G) Representative merged photomicrographs of 72 h cultured myofibers from WT and
  Ltf-KO mice co-stained with MyoD, Ki67, and DAPI. Scale bars: 30 μm. (H) Quantification
  of myogenic cells number per myofiber. (I) Representative individual and merged
  images of day 3 post-injury TA muscles of WT and Ltf-KO mice, cells were labeled
  with EdU and DAPI. Scale bar: 30 μm. (J) Quantification of the number of EdU+ cells
  in day 3 post-injury TA muscles of WT and Ltf-KO mice. (K) Immunohistochemistry
  analysis of Ki67+ cells in regenerating muscle from WT and Ltf-KO mice at day 3
  after injury. Scale bars: 30 μm. (L) Quantification of the number and percentage
  of Ki67+ cells in regenerating TA muscle of WT and Ltf-KO mice. (M) Representative
  individual and merged images of day 3 post-injury TA muscles of WT and Ltf-KO mice,
  cells were labeled with MyoD, Ki67and DAPI. Scale bar: 30 μm. (N) Quantification
  of the percentage of MyoD+Ki67+ double-positive cells among the total nuclei in
  injured TA muscle of WT and Ltf-KO mice. (O) Representative merged images of day
  5 post-injury TA muscles of WT and Ltf-KO mice, cells were labeled with PAX7, Laminin
  and DAPI. Scale bar: 30 μm. (P) Quantification of the percentage of PAX7-positive
  cells among the total nuclei in injured TA muscle of WT and Ltf-KO mice. n = 3 in
  each group. * p< 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.'
