caption: 'PF leaf treatment can significantly reduce the asthma symptom score and
  improve the lung function of OVA-induced asthma model mice. (A) Timeline schematic
  for the development of OVA-induced asthma mouse model. Mice were sensitized three
  times intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 0, 7 and 14, and challenged intratracheally
  (i.t.) on days 21, 28, 35 and 49 with 100 μg OVA in 100 μL PBS. And mice were intragastrically
  treated with PBS (Naïve group and Model group), PF leaf or Dex (i.g. once daily)
  from 21st to 49th days. (B), Asthma symptom scores. The results of pulmonary function
  test in the six groups (n = 6–8 for per group); (C), Penh; (D), Te; (E) TV and (F)
  F. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with the Naïve group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, versus
  the Model group. (G) Lungs were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E,
  100 × magnification). (Naive) naïve group, (Model) OVA-induced asthma model group,
  (L-PF) low-dose PF group, (M − PF) medium-dose PF group, (H-PF) high-dose PF group,
  (Dex) Dexamethasone group.'
