caption: CTLs depletion was induced through the ER stress PERK-CHOP pathway. After
  coculturing hepatoma cells with CTLL-2 cells, (a) western blotting was used to examine
  the expression of PERK, P-PERK, and CHOP. (b) TM-induced protein expression of PERK,
  P-PERK, and CHOP. (c) 4-PBA treatment induced a reduction in PERK, P-PERK, and CHOP
  protein levels. (d) Cells were cocultured for one day and CTLL-2 cells were treated
  with either GSK2656157 (0, 10, 50 and 100 nM) for one day. Western blotting analysis
  of ER stress-associated protein expression. (e) Electron microscopic analysis (scale
  bar = 2 μm). (f) Protein expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 in CTLL-2 cells. (g) Expression
  of PRF1 and GzmB in CTLL-2 cells. (h) Expression of ER stress-associated proteins
  in CTLL-2 cells after one day of silencing CHOP plasmid (0 and 0.25 μg/μL) treatment.
  (i) ER morphology was detected by electron microscopy (scale bar = 2 μm). (j) Western
  blotting and (k) ELISA analysis. Data are presented as the means ± SD. ∗∗∗P < 0.001,
  ns indicates no statistical significance.
