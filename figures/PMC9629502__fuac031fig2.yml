caption: Schematic examples of Negative Frequency Dependent Selection (NFDS) in E.
  coli at (A), species population level, and (B), clonal lineage level. NFDS generates
  population diversity by maintaining uncommon phenotypes without maximizing population
  fitness in the current environment. A. Schematic phylogeny of key clonal lineages
  of E. coli. Every lineage is composed of highly successful pathogens, but each lineage
  is intimately associated with a single O-serotype. Note that ST73 and ST95 share
  an identical human ecology and yet have different O-serotypes—therefore, a successful
  immune response against O6 (present in ST73) would prevent ST73 from colonising,
  but not ST95 and other similar E. coli lineages. The presence of O1 in both ST95
  and ST648 illustrates that an O-serotype is not restricted to a single lineage but
  can appear across the species. B. Presence of unique alleles of exemplar genes in
  the E. coli ST131 lineage. Each column denotes a gene, with its functional pathway
  indicated above. Unique alleles are represented by solid blocks, and are distributed
  across the entire phylogenetic tree at low frequency. These alleles help maintain
  diversity in the population and allow ‘bet-hedging’ within the lineage, should they
  confer a fitness advantage in a changing environment. If these alleles were present
  at a high frequency across the lineage, their benefit to the lineage would be lost.
