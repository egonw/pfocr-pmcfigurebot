caption: A shared mGluR1-PKCγ signaling pathway associated with SCA pathogenesis and
  Purkinje cell dendritic development. Several proteins which are components of the
  mGluR1-PKCγ signaling pathway are encoded by genes mutations of which are known
  to be causing SCA (labeled in blue). The common molecules RGS8, Inpp5a and Stk17b
  have been reported to be dysregulated in at least four different forms of SCA (labeled
  in red) and are directly involved in the mGluR1-PKCγ signaling pathway.
