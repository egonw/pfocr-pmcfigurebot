caption: 'The key mechanisms of anti-tumor effects of RA. Extrinsic apoptosis: RA
  induces extrinsic apoptosis by upregulating TNF-α and caspase-8. Endogenous apoptosis:
  RA inhibits BCL-2 and promotes the expression of BAX, caspase-3, -7, and -9 to mediate
  endogenous apoptosis. P53 pathway and cell cycle: RA inhibits MDM2 expression and
  promotes p53, p21 expression mediates apoptosis. P21 inhibits Cyclin D and Cyclin
  E to induce cell cycle arrest, and RA inhibits Cyclin B, Cyclin D, and Cyclin E
  to mediate cell cycle arrest and promote apoptosis. PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathway:
  RA promotes the expression of tumor suppressor gene PTEN, inhibits PI3K expression,
  AKT phosphorylation, NF-κB expression, and p65 phosphorylation, which induces apoptosis
  through the inhibition of cell survival-related pathways.'
