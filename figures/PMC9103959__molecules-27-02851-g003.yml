caption: Protein expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (A,C)
  and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (B,D) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 cells.
  Cells were pretreated for 3 h with indicated concentrations of compounds 1 and 2
  and stimulated for 24 h with LPS (0.5 μg/mL). Representative blots from three independent
  experiments are shown. Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ software. Band intensities
  were normalized to β-actin. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with LPS-treated group.
