caption: 'A schematic presentation of critical role of PERK in metabolic reprogramming
  of macrophages via epigenetic changes. (A) IL-4 stimulation to WT macrophages results
  in activation of immunosuppressive M2 macrophage via SBP. (B) IL-4 stimulation to
  PERKcKO macrophages or PSAT1cKO macrophages results in alteration in SBP, which
  is responsible to drive the immunosuppressive epigenetic modifications in M2 macrophages.
  (C) Treatment of mice with GSK2656157 (PERK inhibitor) or NCT-503 (PHGDH inhibitor)
  reduce tumor burden as a monotherapy and combination therapy of AntiPD1 + GSK2656157
  potentiate the antitumor response. PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; SBP:
  serine biosynthesis pathway.'
