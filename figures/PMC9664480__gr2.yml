caption: Alterations in gut microbiota and different digestive tract reconstruction
  methods. (A and B) 16S-rRNA sequencing analysis of fecal samples from GC patients
  with R-Y, B-I, and B-II digestive tract reconstructions one year after surgery.
  Shannon (A) and Simpson (B) indexes were analyzed in each group; n = 6. (C) PCoA
  plot of the R-Y, B-I, and B-II groups based on Bray–Curtis distance; n = 6. (D)
  Relative abundance of SCFA-producing microbes in fecal samples; n = 6. (E and F)
  LEfSe analysis of gut microbiota alterations caused by gastrectomy and digestive
  tract reconstruction. Each group was analyzed before surgery (E) and after surgery
  (F); n = 6. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05.
