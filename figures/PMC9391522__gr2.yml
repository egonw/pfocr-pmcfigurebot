caption: Treatment with CAN-2409 under concomitant blockade of the ATR-CHK1 pathway
  leads to improved survival in vivo(A) Experimental setup for in vivo survival study.
  100,000 GL261fluc cells were injected stereotactically into the right hemisphere.
  7 days later, CAN-2409/sham was injected into the same location, followed by treatment
  with ganciclovir and/or AZD6738 for a total of 7 days. Endpoint was considered as
  a weight loss of 20%, onset of neurological symptoms, or signs of pain and distress.
  n = 6 per group. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves. No difference in median survival
  between untreated control (28.5 days) and AZD6738 monotherapy (29 days) were observed,
  while CAN-2409 treatment resulted in a prolonged median survival (77 days) that
  was enhanced by AZD6738. More than 50% of the animals that received combinatorial
  treatment survived beyond the experiment termination date (125 days). Combined treatment
  with CAN-2409 and AZD6738 significantly prolonged survival (control versus combination
  p = 0.0022). Log rank test was used to determine significance. (C) Prospective MRI
  analysis of tumor formation of in vivo survival study. 3 animals per group of the
  survival study underwent MR imaging 18, 25, and 31 days after tumor implantation.
  Massive progressive tumor growth was noted in all animals of the control and AZD6738-treatment
  cohort. Only slight tumor progression was observed in the CAN-2409 group, while
  the combination cohort presented possible tumor growth in one animal only.
