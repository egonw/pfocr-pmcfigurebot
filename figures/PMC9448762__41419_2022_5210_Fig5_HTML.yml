figure_title: S1PR1 upregulation reduced ceramide levels via inhibition of CerS3 expression
caption: 'A Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of S1PR1 in HAECs
  and investigate the expression of 38 metabolic enzymes of the sphingolipid pathway
  by PCR array. B CerS3/CerS6/SPHK1 in HAECs was assessed by WB. C The S1P-related
  enzymes SPHK1/SPHK2/SGPL1 in HAECs were assessed by WB. D The content of S1P in
  HAECs was measured by ELISA. E The level of ceramide (green) in HAECs was determined
  by IF. DAPI staining is indicated in blue. Scale bar: 150 μm. F The expression of
  CerS3 in ECs-shS1PR1 was detected by WB. G IF was used to probe ceramide in HAECs-shS1PR1.
  Scale bar: 150 μm. H Tube formation in HAECs-shS1PR1 was detected. Data are presented
  as the means ± SDs, and an independent t test was used to analyse the significant
  difference. ***P < 0.01. Scale bar: 200 μm. I Growth curve of subcutaneous tumours
  derived from ECs-NC (2.5 × 106 cells per mouse) or ECs-shS1PR1 (2.5 × 106 cells
  per mouse) mixed with Huh7 cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) (n = 5 mice per group).
  These mice were treated with FB1 at 16 days and were stopped by cervical dislocation
  at 30 days. The other groups of ECs-NC (2.5 × 106 cells per mouse) or ECs-shS1PR1
  (2.5 × 106 cells per mouse) mixed with Huh7 cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) (n = 5
  mice per group) were used as the control groups. J Representative images of xenografts
  in (J) at day 30 (n = 5 mice per group).'
