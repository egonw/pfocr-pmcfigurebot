caption: Subcellular localization of OsiWAK1-eYFP in protoplasts. A–D, were obtained
  at 16 h after transfection. A and B, OsiWAK1-eYFP transiently co-expressed with
  AtWAK21–29aa-mCherry-HDEL (endoplasmic reticulum marker) and mCherry-AtVAMP721 (SVC
  marker), respectively. C and D, WT protoplasts expressing OsiWAK1-eYFP and treated
  with FM4–64 for 40 min. E and F, Signals of ball-like structures and irregular features
  detected at 72 h after transfection, respectively. Fluorescent signals containing
  clear boundaries that appear ball-like were termed ball-like structure signals.
  Fluorescent signals without clear boundaries were termed irregular feature signals.
  B, Ball-like structure signal; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; I, irregular
  feature signal; M, membrane-like structure signal. Bars, 5 µm.
