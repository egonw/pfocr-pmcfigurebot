caption: The SOCS family was disturbed in Foxp3-Mettl14 f/+ cKO mice. (A) RNA-seq
  indicated that 434 genes were upregulated and 277 genes were downregulated in Treg
  cells from Foxp3-Mettl14 f/+ cKO mice compared with the littermate controls. (B)
  Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that transplantation related signaling
  pathways were altered in Treg cells from Foxp3-Mettl14 f/+ cKO mice. (C) KEGG pathways
  were enriched in proliferation and activation in immune cells. (D–F) The expression
  of SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 in Treg cells from littermate controls and Foxp3-Mettl14
  f/+ cKO mice on day 7 post-transplantation in the presence or absence of mAbs was
  validated using qPCR and western blotting. (G) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the RNA-seq results for the Socs2 gene, which indicated that the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway was altered in METTL14 deficient Treg cells post-transplantation. The data
  are shown as the means ± SD and are representative of three separate experiments.
  The data in (D) depict the mean mRNA expression normalized to the gene Gapdh. The
  data in (F) depict the mean protein expression normalized to the β-Actin.The statistical
  analysis was performed with an unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed).****P<0.0001,
  ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05. P values >0.05 were considered nonsignificant (n.s.).
