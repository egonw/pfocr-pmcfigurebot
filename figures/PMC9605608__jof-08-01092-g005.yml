caption: Clustering of DEGs associated with amino acid metabolism (A), MAPK signaling
  pathway (B), starch and sucrose metabolism (C) and circadian rhythm (D) between
  0RE+ and 0RE− and between 200RE+ and 200RE−. Color panels stand for log2(fold change).
  Asterisks indicate statistically significant changes with FDR < 0.01 and fold change
  ≥ 2.
