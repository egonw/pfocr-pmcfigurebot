caption: The DEmRNAs in the DEcircRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA network were analyzed by GO annotation
  and KEGG pathway. (a) The top 15 GO terms enriched by DEmRNAs based on BP, CC, and
  MF categories. (b) Pathways significantly enriched by the DEmRNAs in the KEGG database.
  Red indicates small p value, and blue indicates large p value; the size of the bubbles
  indicates the degree of enrichment, and larger bubbles reflect larger gene ratio.
