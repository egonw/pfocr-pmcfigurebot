caption: Vasn deletion induced autophagy by regulating the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.
  (A) Pathway enrichment results of target genes of differential expression microRNAs,
  where the mTOR pathway is of the Top 1 that has been significantly enriched (red
  highlightened). (B) Immunohistochemical analysis of mTOR signaling protein expression
  in the liver of WT, Vasn+/−, and Vasn−/− mice; bar = 100 μm. (C) Quantitative integrated
  optical density (IOD) analysis of immunohistochemical staining from ten mice per
  group, and three photos per sample. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. (D) Vasn deletion
  significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated mTOR (S2448) and increased
  expression of the phosphorylated ULK1 (S555), confirmed by Western blot analysis.
