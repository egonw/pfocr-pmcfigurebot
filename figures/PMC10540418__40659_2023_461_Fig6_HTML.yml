caption: '4T1-CM increases VCAM-1 cell surface expression by activating the eNOS-S-nitrosylation
  pathway. Confluent monolayers of EAhy926 cells were treated with 4T1-CM for different
  periods of time and processed to detect: A p-eNOS by Western-blot. One-Way ANOVA
  and Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test, * p < 0.05; n = 5. B VCAM-1-S-nitrosylation
  by biotin switch. One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test, * p < 0.05;
  n = 4. C Membrane VCAM-1 by cell surface biotinylation. One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s
  Multiple Comparison Test, * p < 0.05; n = 4. D Membrane VCAM-1 in the presence of
  l-NMA and NAC. Two-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test. * p < 0.05
  in comparison to non-treatment; n = 3'
