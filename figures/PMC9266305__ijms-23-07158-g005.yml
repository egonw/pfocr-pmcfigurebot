caption: BHLHE22 expression in cell lines and patients confirmed enrichment of immune-related
  pathway in EC. (a). Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HEC1A
  and Ishikawa cell lines, and TCGA UCEC database based on the BHLHE22 expression
  showed 114 intersect genes among them. (b). Gene ontology and gene set enrichment
  analysis of the 114 DEGs confirmed enrichment of immune-related pathways of BHLHE22.
  MSigDB, The Molecular Signatures Database; UCEC, uterine corpus endometrial cancer;
  GO, gene ontology; FDR, false discovery rate.
