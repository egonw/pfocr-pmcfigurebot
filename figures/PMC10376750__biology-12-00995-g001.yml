caption: Schematic representation of the hypoxia response pathway. In normal conditions,
  prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) catalyze the hydroxylation of HIFα subunits, tag them
  for ubiquitination, and subsequently degrade them by the proteosome. While under
  hypoxic conditions, the activity of PHDs is inhibited, and HIF-α subunits escape
  from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and translocate into the nucleus,
  where it initiates the transcription of target genes to maintain oxygen homeostasis.
