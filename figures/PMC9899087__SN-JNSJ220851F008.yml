caption: Muscarinic inhibition of MTN, but not PL input, is mediated by an M3 receptor-dependent
  facilitation of retrograde eCB signaling. A, The CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251
  (AM, 1 μm), had no significant effect on muscarine (10 μm) inhibition in the PL
  pathway. Muscarine inhibition was completely reversed by atropine (5 μm, n = 6,
  N = 6; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3,15) = 209.96; p = 1.803 × 10−12). B,
  The CB1 agonist, Win 55212-2 (5 μm) strongly suppressed fEPSPs at PL inputs. This
  suppression was reversed by AM251, indicating that it was dependent on CB1 receptors
  (n = 6, N = 6; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,6) = 20.31; p = 0.0021). These
  findings suggest that CB1 receptors are present at PL terminals but are not engaged
  during muscarinic inhibition. C, In contrast, at MTN input, AM251 (1 μm) reversed
  muscarine inhibition (n = 7, N = 7; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3,18) = 16.46;
  p = 2.12 × 10−5). Subsequent addition of atropine had no additional significant
  effect (Tukey post hoc test, p = 0.26). D, AM251 by itself had no significant effect
  on the optogenetically evoked fEPSP at the MTN input (n = 3, N = 3, p = 0.34, paired
  t test), indicating that AM251 did not directly facilitate synaptic transmission
  in this pathway. Together, these results suggest that muscarine inhibits responses
  in the MTN pathway by acting on postsynaptic M3 receptors to facilitate retrograde
  eCB release which acts on presynaptic CB1 receptors on MTN terminals. **p < 0.01.
