caption: Microvesicle containing protein‐coding RNA profile effectively reflected
  the pathological response of parental cells. (A–C) KEGG pathway analysis of significantly
  changed protein‐coding RNAs in CVB3‐infected cells (Cells‐CVB3) as well as cell‐derived
  exosomes (Exo‐CVB3) or MVs (MV‐CVB3) using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. HCT‐116
  cells were infected with CVB3 for 24 h, then the cells, secreted exosomes, and MVs
  were collected for RNA‐seq sequencing. Three replicate samples in each group were
  performed. The KEGG pathway of Cells‐CVB3 vs. Exo‐CVB3 and Cells‐CVB3 vs. MV‐CVB3
  were also shown by the Venn diagram (B and C). (D–F) KEGG pathway analysis of significantly
  changed protein‐coding RNAs in CVB3‐infected cells (Cells‐CVB3), cell‐derived exosomes
  (Exo‐CVB3), and MVs (MV‐CVB3) using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. The red font
  represents the overlapping pathway of Cells‐CVB3 and Exo‐CVB3, while the blue font
  represents the overlapping pathway of Cells‐CVB3 and MV‐CVB3. (G and H) The significantly
  changed protein‐coding RNAs of infected cells, derived exosomes, and MVs were analyzed
  by the GAD_DISEASE tool in the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource. Venn diagrams of known
  disease of infected cells, exosomes, and MVs were presented. The overlap disease
  items were listed.
