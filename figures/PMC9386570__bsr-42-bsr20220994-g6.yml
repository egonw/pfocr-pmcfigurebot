figure_title: MLN4924 inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in mice
caption: (A) The xenograft tumors were detected by in vivo bioluminescence imaging.
  (B) Compared with the control group, the growth of the xenograft tumors in the experimental
  group was significantly inhibited. (C,D) The NEDDylation of CULs was inhibited and
  the protein expression levels of p21 and p53 significantly increased in xenograft
  tumors of mice treated with MLN4924 (n=5). ***P<0.001. An independent sample t-test
  was conducted to compare the means between two groups. Each experiment was carried
  out in triplicate.
