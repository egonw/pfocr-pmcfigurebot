figure_title: Dual RNAseq analyses reveal a unique host transcriptional profile stimulated
  by ΔM062R MYXV infection that is distinct from that caused by dsDNA alone
caption: A. PCA plot of mock, ISD, ΔM062R, and wildtype MYXV treated samples. THP-1
  cells are differentiated into macrophage-like cells followed by mock treatment,
  ISD transfection, infection with ΔM062R or wildtype MYXV at a moi of 10 for 8 hours
  before harvesting for RNA extraction, library generation, and next generation sequencing.
  Triplicate per group (biological replicate) is included for this experiment. Good
  separation among all four samples are observed with close clustering within replicates.
  B. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed signaling pathway stimulated by ΔM062R
  infection. Host genes differentially expressed during ΔM062R infection at 8h post-infection
  are analyzed using IPA (Qiagen, version 01-20-04) for pathways affected. The graphic
  summary is shown. The orange color highlighted pathways are upregulated (e.g., cGAS
  pathway), while pathways in blue are being downregulated. C. Heatmap showing distinct
  host ISG gene expression profile stimulated by ΔM062R. All significant differentially
  expressed genes under study were visualized using the R library heatmap.2. Gene
  counts were normalized using DESeQ2’s default normalization. Values in each row
  were scaled using a z-score method before plotting and ward. D hierarchical clustering
  was performed using the Euclidean distance measure (on the larger heatmap) and no
  clustering was performed on the break-out heatmap. Representative genes from RT2-PCR
  assay from  are shown. D. Distinct host transcription profiles between ΔM062R and
  wildtype MYXV infection. All significant differentially expressed genes, between
  the groups under study, were visualized using the R library heatmap.2. Gene counts
  were normalized using DESeQ2’s default normalization. Values of each row were scaled
  using a z-score method before plotting and ward. D hierarchical clustering was performed
  using the Euclidean distance measure on the larger heatmap, and no clustering was
  performed on the breakout heatmap. The R library ReactomePA was utilized to perform
  a pathway enrichment analysis. All downregulated DEGs were sent to the library,
  and the top 5 enriched pathways are displayed (q-value/p.adjust < 0.1). GeneRatio
  indicates the ratio between the number of overlapping DEGs in the given pathway,
  and the total number of DEGs. Further, the size of each dot represents the Count,
  or the total number of overlapping DEGs in a given pathway.
