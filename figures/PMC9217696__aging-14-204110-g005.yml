caption: Overexpression of LINC00094 affects IC50 of breast cancer cells to Letrozole.
  (A) The cell healing rate at 0 hours and 72 hours was measured by scratch assay
  with the scale of 100 μm. The experiment was repeated 3 times. **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001.
  (B) Transwell assay was performed to detect the effect of LINC00094 overexpression
  on the mobility of breast cancer cells, 20× microscope field, and the experiment
  was repeated 3 times. ****P<0.0001. (C) Cell clonal formation assay was performed
  to detect the effect of overexpression of LINC00094 on the colony formation of breast
  cancer cells. The experiment was repeated for 3 times.****P<0.0001. (D) CCK-8 was
  used to detect cell activity, and each group had 3 repeated wells.**P<0.01. (E)
  Graphpad Prism calculated IC50 of MCF-7 and BT-474 cells against Letrozole. ****P<0.0001.
