caption: Proteomic analysis of left ventricle tissue from Perm1–/– mice and WT mice
  (n = 5/group). Among 2,868 detected proteins, 207 proteins were significantly downregulated
  and 320 proteins were significantly upregulated in Perm1–/– hearts (p < 0.05 by
  t-test). (A) PCA of all detected proteins from Perm1–/– (red) and WT hearts (blue).
  (B) Heat map of the proteins that were differentially expressed in Perm1–/– heart.
  Enrichment analyses of upregulate (C) and downregulated proteins (D) for KEGG pathways.
  The white numbers in bar graphs indicate the number of proteins that were detected
  in each pathway. (E) Network map of the 82 significantly changed proteins which
  belong to the collective KEGG term metabolic pathways in panel (D). (F) Heat maps
  of fold changes from the 35 proteins comprising the network map presented in panel
  (E). Analysis of cardiac ultrastructure with representative electron microscopy
  images (G), quantification of changes in mitochondrial cristae morphology (H), and
  quantification of mitochondrial cristae density (I) of hearts of WT mice (blue bars,
  n = 3) and Perm1–/– mice (red bars, n = 3). *p < 0.05 (student’s t-test), ± SED.
