caption: Comparison of the molecular characteristics between the NSCLC subtypes. (A)
  Heatmap of top 100 DEGs expressed in NSCLC subtypes as annotated by clinical features.
  (B) Venn diagram showing the intersection between the prognosis-related DDR genes
  and DEGs in the training set. (C) KEGG and (D) GO analysis results of DEGs between
  the NSCLC subclasses in the training set. (E) Comparison of the DDR pathway and
  key DDR pathway genes between the NSCLC subclasses. Heatmaps were generated to show
  the biological processes, in which red indicates activation status and blue indicates
  inhibition status. (F) Comparison of expression differences of key DDR genes in
  the two subclasses. *,P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001;
  ns, no significance.
